An '''amphora''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|æ|m|f|ər|ə}}; [[Ancient Greek|Greek]]: ἀμφορεύς, ''amphoréus''; English plural: '''amphorae''' or '''amphoras''') is a type of container of a characteristic shape and size, descending from at least as early as the [[Neolithic]] Period. Amphorae were used in vast numbers for the transport and storage of various products, both liquid and dry, but mostly for wine. They are most often [[ceramic]], but examples in metals and other materials have been found.  Versions of the amphorae were one of many shapes used in [[Ancient Greek vase painting]]. 

The amphora complements the large storage container, the [[pithos]], which makes available capacities between one-half and two and one-half tons. In contrast, the amphora holds under a half-ton, typically less than 50 kilograms (100 lbs). The bodies of the two types have similar shapes. Where the pithos may have multiple small loops or lugs for fastening a rope harness, the amphora has two expansive [[package handle|handles]] joining the shoulder of the body and a long neck. The necks of pithoi are wide for scooping or bucket access. The necks of amphorae are narrow for pouring by a person holding it by the bottom and a handle. Some variants exist. The handles might not be present. The size may require two or three handlers to lift. For the most part, however, an amphora was tableware, or sat close to the table, was intended to be seen, and was finely decorated as such by master painters.

Stoppers of perishable materials, which have rarely survived, were used to seal the contents. Two principal types of amphorae existed: the ''neck amphora'', in which the neck and body meet at a sharp angle; and the ''one-piece amphora'', in which the neck and body form a continuous curve. Neck amphorae were commonly used in the early history of ancient Greece, but were gradually replaced by the one-piece type from around the 7th century BC onward.

Most were produced with a pointed base to allow upright storage by embedding in soft ground, such as sand. The base facilitated transport by ship, where the amphorae were packed upright or on their sides in as many as five staggered layers.&lt;ref name=Adkins196&gt;{{cite book | ref=harv | last=Adkins | first=L. | last2=Adkins | first2=R.A. | year=1994 | title=Handbook to life in Ancient Rome | location=New York, N.Y. | publisher=Facts on File |page=196}}&lt;/ref&gt; If upright, the bases probably were held by some sort of rack, and ropes passed through their handles to prevent shifting or toppling during rough seas. Heather and reeds might be used as packing around the vases. Racks could be used in kitchens and shops. The base also concentrated deposits from liquids with suspended solid particles, such as olive oil and wines.

Amphorae are of great use to [[Maritime archaeology|maritime archaeologists]], as they often indicate the age of a [[shipwreck]] and the geographic origin of the cargo. They are occasionally so well preserved that the original content is still present, providing information on foodstuffs and mercantile systems. Amphorae were too cheap and plentiful to return to their origin-point and so, when empty, they were broken up at their destination. At a breakage site in Rome, [[Testaccio]], close to the [[Tiber]], the fragments, later wetted with [[Calcium hydroxide]] (Calce viva), remained to create a hill now named [[Monte Testaccio]], {{convert|45|m|ft|abbr=on}} high and more than 1&amp;nbsp;kilometre in circumference.

==Etymology==
Amphora is a Greco-Roman word developed in [[ancient Greek]] during the [[Bronze Age]]. The Romans acquired it during the Hellenization that occurred in the [[Roman Republic]]. [[Cato the Younger|Cato]] is the first known literary person to use it. The Romans turned the Greek form into a standard -a declension noun, ''amphora'', pl. ''amphorae''.&lt;ref name=lewis&gt;{{L&amp;S|amphora|ref}}&lt;/ref&gt; Undoubtedly, the word and the vase were introduced to Italy through the Greek settlements there, which traded extensively in Greek pottery.

It is remarkable that even though the [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscans]] imported, manufactured, and exported amphorae extensively in their wine industry, and other Greek vase names were Etruscanized, no Etruscan form of the word exists. There was perhaps an as yet unidentified native Etruscan word for the vase that pre-empted the adoption of ''amphora''.

[[File:Linear B Ideogram B209.svg|left]]
The Latin word derived from the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''amphoreus'' ({{lang|grc|ἀμφορεύς}}),&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|a)mforeu/s|ἀμφορεύς|ref}}.&lt;/ref&gt; a shortened form of ''amphiphoreus'' ({{lang|grc|ἀμφιφορεύς}}), a compound word combining ''amphi-'' ("on both sides", "twain")&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|a)mfi/|ἀμφί|shortref}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''phoreus'' ("carrier"), from ''pherein'' ("to carry"),&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|foreu/s|φορεύς}}, {{LSJ|fe/rw|φέρειν|shortref}}.&lt;/ref&gt; referring to the vessel's two carrying handles on opposite sides.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Göransson | first=Kristian | title=The transport amphorae from Euesperides: The maritime trade of a Cyrenaican city 400-250 BC | series=Acta Archaeologica Lundensia, Series in 4o No. 25 | publisher=Lund | location=Stockholm | year=2007 | page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The amphora appears as {{lang|gmy|𐀀𐀠𐀡𐀩𐀸}}, ''a-pi-po-re-we'', in the [[Linear B]] Bronze Age records of Knossos, {{lang|gmy|𐀀𐀡𐀩𐀸}}, ''a-po-re-we'', at Mycenae, and the fragmentary '']-re-we'' at Pylos, designated by {{nowrap|Ideogram 209}} {{lang|gmy|𐃨}}, [[Emmett L. Bennett, Jr.|Bennett's]] AMPHORA, which has a number of scribal variants. The two spellings are transcriptions of amphiphorēwes (plural) and amphorēwe (dual) in Mycenaean Greek from which it may be seen that the short form prevailed on the mainland. Homer uses the long form for metrical reasons, and Herodotus has the short form. Ventris and Chadwick's translation is "carried on both sides."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Michael | last=Ventris | first2=John | last2=Chadwick | title=Documents in Mycenaean Greek | location=Cambridge | publisher=University Press | year=1973 | edition=2nd | pages=324, 328, 494, 532}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Weights and measures==
[[File:Amphora Dressel 1B.svg|thumb|right|260px|Dressel 1B type amphora&lt;br/&gt;''Key :'' 1 : rim - 2 : neck - 3 : handle - 4 : shoulder - 5 : belly ''or'' body - 6 : foot]]
{{Main|Amphora (unit)}}
Amphorae varied greatly in height. The largest stands as tall as 1.5 metres (5&amp;nbsp;ft) high, while some were less than 30 centimetres (12&amp;nbsp;in) high - the smallest were called amphoriskoi  (literally "little amphorae"). Most were around 45 centimetres (18&amp;nbsp;in) high.

There was a significant degree of standardisation in some variants; the wine amphora held a standard measure of about 39 litres (41 US qt), giving rise to the amphora quadrantal as a unit of measure in the Roman Empire. In all, approximately 66 distinct types of amphora have been identified.

Further, the term also stands for an ancient [[Ancient Roman units of measurement|Roman unit of measurement]] for liquids. The volume of a Roman amphora was one cubic [[Foot (length)|foot]], c. 26.026 [[Litre|L]].

==Production==
Roman amphorae were wheel-thrown terracotta containers. During the production process the body was made first and then left to dry partially.&lt;ref name="Peacock, Williams 1986, 45"&gt;{{cite book | title=Amphorae and the Roman economy: an introductory guide | first=D P S | last=Peacock | first2=D F | last2=Williams | location=London; New York | publisher=Longman | year=1986 | series=Longman archaeology series |page=45}}&lt;/ref&gt; Then coils of clay were added to form the neck, the rim, and the handles.&lt;ref name="Peacock, Williams 1986, 45"/&gt; Once the amphora was complete, the maker then treated the interior with resin that would prevent permeation of stored liquids.&lt;ref&gt;Rizzo 2003, 141.&lt;/ref&gt; The reconstruction of these stages of production is based primarily on the study of modern amphora production in some areas of the eastern Mediterranean.&lt;ref name="Peacock, Williams 1986, 45"/&gt;

Amphorae often were marked with a variety of stamps, [[sgraffito]], and inscriptions. They provided information on the production, content, and subsequent marketing. A stamp usually was applied to the amphora at a partially dry stage. It indicates the name of the ''figlina'' (workshop) and/or the name of the owner of the workshop. Painted stamps, ''[[tituli picti]]'', recorded the weight of the container and the contents, and were applied after the amphora was filled.

==Classification==
The first systematic classification of Roman amphorae types was undertaken by the German scholar [[Heinrich Dressel]]. Following the exceptional amphora deposit uncovered in Rome in Castro Pretorio at the end of the 1800s, he collected almost 200 inscriptions from amphorae and included them in the ''[[Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum]]''. In his studies of the amphora deposit he was the first to elaborate a classification of types, the so-called "Dressel table",&lt;ref&gt;Dressel 1879, Di un grande deposito di anfore rinvenuto nel nuovo quartiere del Castro Pretorio, in BullCom, VII, 36-112, 143-196.&lt;/ref&gt; which still is used today for many types.

Subsequent studies on Roman amphorae have produced more detailed classifications, which usually are named after the scholar who studied them. For the neo-Phoenician types see the work by Maña published in 1951,&lt;ref&gt;Maña, Sobre tipologia de ánforas pùnicas, in ''VI Congreso Arqueologico del Sudeste Español'', Alcoy, 1950, Cartagena, 1951, 203-210&lt;/ref&gt; and the revised classification by van der Werff in 1977-1978.&lt;ref&gt;Amphores de tradition punique à Uzita, in BaBesch 52-53, 171-200&lt;/ref&gt; The Gallic amphorae have been studied by Laubenheimer in a study published in 1989,&lt;ref&gt;Laubenheimer, Les amphores gauloises sous l’empire: recherches nouvelles sur leur production et chronologie, in ''Amphores romaines et histoire économiqué: dis ans de recherche''. Actes du Colloque de Sienne (22-24 mai 1986), Rome, 105-138&lt;/ref&gt; whereas the Cretan amphorae have been analyzed by Marangou-Lerat.&lt;ref&gt;Marangou-Lerat, Le vin et les amphores de Crète de l’epoque classique à l’epoque impériale, in ''Etudes Cretoises'', 30, Paris, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; Beltràn studied the Spanish types in 1970.&lt;ref&gt;Beltràn, ''Las anforas Romanas en Espana'', Zaragoza&lt;/ref&gt; Adriatic types have been studied by Lamboglia in 1955.&lt;ref&gt;"Sulla cronologia delle anfore romane di età repubblicana" in ''Rivista Studi Liguri 21'', 252-60&lt;/ref&gt; For a general analysis of the Western Mediterranean types see Panella,{{sfn|Panella|2001|p=177-275|quote=Le anfore di età imperiale del Mediterraneo occidentale", in ''Céramiques hellénistiques et romaines III''}} and Peacock and Williams.&lt;ref name="Peacock, Williams 1986, 45"/&gt;

==History==
===Prehistoric origins===
[[File:Banpo amphora.jpg|thumb|right|Amphora found in [[Banpo]], China. Yangshao culture (5000-3000 BC)]] 
Ceramics of shapes and uses falling within the range of amphorae, with or without handles, are of prehistoric heritage across Eurasia, from the Caucasus to China. For example, the [[kvevri]], common in the Republic of Georgia and the Caucasus, may be traced back to approximately 6000 BC. Amphorae dated to approximately 4800 BC have been found in [[Banpo]], a [[Neolithic]] site of the [[Yangshao culture]] in [[China]]. Amphorae first appeared on the [[Phoenicia]]n coast at approximately 3500 BC.

In the Bronze and Iron Ages amphorae spread around the ancient [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] world, being used by the [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greeks]] and [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] as the principal means for transporting and storing [[grape]]s, [[olive oil]], [[wine]], [[Vegetable oil|oil]], [[olive]]s, [[cereal|grain]], [[fish]], and other [[Commodity|commodities]].&lt;ref name=Adkins196/&gt; They were produced on an industrial scale until approximately the 7th century AD. [[Barrel|Wooden]] and skin containers seem to have supplanted amphorae thereafter.

They influenced [[Chinese ceramics]] and other East Asian ceramic cultures, especially as a fancy shape for high-quality decorative ceramics, and continued to be produced there long after they had ceased to be used further west.

===Ancient Greece: fancy shapes for painting===
[[File:Amphora Athens Louvre A512.jpg|thumb|Large late Geometric Attic amphora, c. 725–700 BC]]
{{further information|Ancient Greek vase painting|Pottery of ancient Greece}}

Besides coarse amphorae used for storage and transport, the vast majority, high-quality painted amphorae were produced in Ancient Greece in significant numbers for a variety of social and ceremonial purposes. Their design differs vastly from the more functional versions; they are typified by wide mouth and a ring base, with a glazed surface and decorated with figures or geometric shapes. They normally have a firm base on which they can stand.  [[Panathenaic Amphorae|amphorae]] were used as prizes in  the [[Panathenaic Festival]]s held between the 6th century BC to the 2nd century BC, filled with olive oil from a sacred grove.  Surviving examples bear the inscription "I am one of the prizes from Athens", and usually depict the particular event they were awarded for. 

Painted amphorae were also used for funerary purposes, often in special types such as the ''[[loutrophoros]]''. Especially in earlier periods, outsize vases were used as grave markers, while some amphorae were used as containers for the ashes of the dead. By the Roman period vase-painting had largely died out, and utilitarian amphorae were normally the only type produced.

====Greek amphora types====
Various different types of amphorae were popular at different times:

=====Neck amphora (c. 6th-5th century BC)=====
On a neck amphora, the handles are attached to the neck, which is separated from the belly by an angular carination. There are two main types of neck amphorae:
* the [[Nolan amphora]] (late 5th century BC), named for its type site, [[Nola]] near [[Naples]], and
* the [[Tyrrhenian amphorae|Tyrrhenian amphora]].
There are also some rarer special types of neck amphora, distinguished by specific features, for example:
* the [[Pointed amphora]], with a notably pointed toe, sometimes ending in a knob-like protrusion
* the ''[[Loutrophoros]]'', used for storing water during  ritual ceremonies, such as marriages and funerals.

=====Belly amphora (c. 640-450 BC)=====
In contrast to the neck amphora, a belly amphora does not have a distinguished neck; instead the belly reaches the mouth in a continuous curve. After the mid-5th century BC, this type was rarely produced. The ''[[pelike]]'' is a special type of belly amphora, with the belly placed lower, so that the widest point of the vessel is near its bottom. The ''pelike'' was introduced around the end of the 6th century BC.

=====Panathenaic prize amphora=====
[[File:Terracotta Panathenaic prize amphora MET GR147.jpg|thumb|[[Panathenaic amphora|Panathenaic prize amphora]] for runners, c. 530 BC]]
Another special type is the [[Panathenaic amphora|Panathenaic prize amphora]], with [[black-figure vase painting|black-figure]] decoration, produced exclusively as prize vessels for the [[Panathenaia]] and retaining the black-figure technique for centuries after the introduction of [[red-figure vase painting]]. Some examples bear the inscription "ΤΩΝ ΑΘΗΝΗΘΕΝ ΑΘΛΩΝ" meaning "[I am one] of the prizes from [the goddess] Athena".  They contained the prize of oil from the sacred olive tree of the goddess [[Athena]] for the winners of the athletic contests held to honour the goddess, and were evidently kept thereafter, and perhaps used to store wine, before being buried with the prize-winner. They depicted goddess Athena on one side (as seen on the second image on this page) and the athletic event on the other side, e.g. a scene of wrestling or running contest etc.
[[File:Hellenistic Glasamphora from Olbia Antikensammlung Berlin 3.jpg|thumb|A Greek glass amphora, 2nd half of the 2nd century BC, from [[Olbia]], [[Corsica and Sardinia|Roman-era Sardinia]], now in the [[Altes Museum]]]]

===Ancient Rome===
By the Roman period utilitarian amphorae were normally the only type produced.

The first type of Roman amphora, Dressel 1, appears in central Italy in the late 2nd century BC.{{sfn|Panella|2001|p=177}} This type had thick walls and a characteristic red fabric. It was very heavy, although also strong. Around the middle of the 1st century BC the so-called Dressel 2-4 starts to become widely used.{{sfn|Panella|2001|p=194}} This type of amphora presented some advantages in being lighter and with thinner walls. It has been calculated that while a ship could accommodate approximately 4500 Dressel 1, it was possible to fit 6000 Dressel 2-4 in the same space.{{sfn|Bruno|2005|p=369|quote=La anfore da trasporto in La ceramica e i materiali di età romana a cura di D. Gandolfi, Bordighera}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dressel 2-4 were often produced in the same workshops used for the production of Dressel 1 which quickly ceased to be used.{{sfn|Panella|2001|p=194}}

At the same time in [[Cuma (Italy)|Cuma]] (southern Italy) the production of the ''cadii cumani'' type starts (Dressel 21-22). These containers were mainly used for the transportation of fruit and were used until the middle imperial times. At the same time, in central Italy, the so-called [[Spello]] amphorae, small containers, were produced for the transportation of wine. On the Adriatic coast the older types were replaced by the Lamboglia 2 type, a wine amphora commonly produced between the end of the 2nd and the 1st century BC. This type develops later into the Dressel 6A which becomes dominant during Augustan times.{{sfn|Bruno|2005|p=369}}

In the Gallic provinces the first examples of Roman amphorae were local imitations of pre-existent types such as Dressel 1, Dressel 2-4, Pascual 1, and Haltern 70. The more typical Gallic production begins within the ceramic ateliers in [[Marseille]] during late Augustan times. The type Oberaden 74 was produced to such an extent that it influenced the production of some Italic types.{{sfn|Panella|2001|p=194}} Spanish amphorae became particularly popular thanks to a flourishing production phase in late Republican times. The ''[[Hispania Baetica]]'' and ''[[Hispania Tarraconensis]]'' regions (south-western and eastern Spain) were the main production areas between the 2nd and the 1st century BC due to the distribution of land to military veterans and the founding of new colonies. Spanish amphorae were widespread in the Mediterranean area during early imperial times. The most common types were all produced in Baetica and among these there were the Dressel 20, a typical olive oil container, the Dressel 7-13, for [[garum]] (fish sauce), and the Haltern 70, for [[defrutum]] (fruit sauce). In the Tarraconensis region the Pascual 1 was the most common type, a wine amphora shaped on the Dressel 1, and imitations of Dressel 2-4.

North-African production was based on an ancient tradition which may be traced back to the [[Phoenicia]]n colony of [[Carthage]].{{sfn|Panella|2001|p=207}} Phoenician amphorae had characteristic small handles attached directly onto the upper body. This feature becomes the distinctive mark of late-Republican/early imperial productions, which are then called neo-Phoenician. The types produced in [[Tripolitania]] and Northern Tunisia are the Maña C1 and C2, later renamed van Der Werff 1, 2, and 3.&lt;ref&gt;Van der Werff 1977-78.&lt;/ref&gt; In the Aegean area the types from the island of [[Rhodes]] were quite popular starting from the 3rd century BC due to local wine production which flourished over a long period. These types developed into the ''Camulodunum'' 184, an amphora used for the transportation of Rhodian wine all over the empire. Imitations of the Dressel 2-4 were produced on the island of Cos for the transportation of wine from the 4th century BC until middle imperial times.{{sfn|Bruno|2005|p=374}} Cretan containers also were popular for the transportation of wine and can be found around the Mediterranean from Augustan times until the 3rd century AD.{{sfn|Bruno|2005|p=375}} During the late empire period, north-African types dominated amphora production. The so-called African I and II types were widely used from the 2nd until the late 4th century AD. Other types from the eastern Mediterranean (Gaza), such as the so-called Late Roman 4, became very popular between the 4th and the 7th century AD, while Italic productions ceased.

==Modern use==
Some modern winemakers and [[brewer]]s are using amphoras to provide a different palate and tastes to their products than are available with other aging methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Back to the future|url=http://www.cantillon.be/br/3_22|website=Cantillon.be/br/|publisher=Brasserie Cantillon|accessdate=6 November 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141106192624/http://www.cantillon.be/br/3_22|archivedate=6 November 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Anagnorisis''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|æ|n|ə|ɡ|ˈ|n|ɒr|ᵻ|s|ᵻ|s}}; {{lang-grc|ἀναγνώρισις}}) is a moment in a play or other work when a character makes a critical discovery. Anagnorisis originally meant [[Recall (memory)|recognition]] in its Greek context, not only of a person but also of what that person stood for. Anagnorisis was the [[hero]]'s sudden awareness of a real situation, the realisation of things as they stood, and finally, the hero's insight into a relationship with an often [[antagonist]]ic [[fictional character|character]] in [[Aristotle|Aristotelian]] [[tragedy]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Northrop Frye]], "Myth, Fiction, And Displacement" p 25 ''Fables of Identity:  Studies in Poetic Mythology'', {{ISBN|0-15-629730-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tragedy==
In his ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'', as part of his discussion of [[peripeteia]], Aristotle defined anagnorisis as "a change from ignorance to knowledge, producing love or hate between the persons destined by the poet for good or bad fortune" (1452a). It is often discussed along with Aristotle's concept of [[catharsis]].

[[File:Lear and Cordelia.jpg|right|thumb|"Lear and Cordelia" by [[Ford Madox Brown]]:  Lear, driven out by his older daughters and rescued by his youngest, realizes their true characters.]]
In the [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]] definition of tragedy, it was the discovery of one's own identity or true character (e.g. Cordelia, Edgar, Edmund, etc. in [[Shakespeare]]'s ''[[King Lear]]'') or of someone else's identity or true nature (e.g. Lear's children, Gloucester's children) by the tragic hero.  

Aristotle was the first writer to discuss the uses of anagnorisis, with peripeteia caused by it. He considered it the mark of a superior tragedy, as when [[Oedipus]] killed his father and married his mother in ignorance, and later learned the truth, or when [[Iphigeneia in Tauris]] realizes in time that the strangers she is to sacrifice are her brother and his friend, and refrains from sacrificing them.  Aristotle considered these complex plots superior to simple plots without anagnorisis or peripeteia, such as when [[Medea]] resolves to kill her children, knowing they are her children, and does so.

Another prominent example of anagnorisis in tragedy is in [[Aeschylus]]'s "The Choephoroi" ("[[Libation Bearers]]") when [[Electra]] recognizes her brother, [[Orestes]], after he has returned to [[Argos]] from his exile, at the grave of their father, [[Agamemnon]], who had been murdered at the hands of [[Clytemnestra]], their mother. [[Electra]] convinces herself that Orestes is her brother with three pieces of evidence: a lock of Orestes's hair on the grave, his footprints next to the grave, and a piece of weaving which she embroidered herself.  The footprints and the hair are identical to her own. Electra's awareness is of her brother's presence, who is the one person who can help her by avenging the death of their father.&lt;ref&gt;
Aeschylus, and Robert Lowell. The Oresteia of Aeschylus. New York: Farrar, Straus, Giroux, 1978.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Comedy==
[[File:Robson Crane Comedy of Errors.jpg|right|thumb|Poster for a performance of ''[[The Comedy of Errors]]'':  When the twins, confused with each other throughout the play, recognize each other's existence, the play reaches its happy ending.]]
The section of Aristotle's ''Poetics'' dealing with comedy did not survive, but many critics also discuss recognition in comedies.  A standard plot of the [[New Comedy]] was the final revelation, by birth tokens, that the heroine was of respectable birth and so suitable for the hero to marry. This was often brought about by the machinations of the [[tricky slave]].  This plot appears in Shakespeare's ''[[The Winter's Tale]]'', where a recognition scene in the final act reveals that Perdita is a king's daughter rather than a shepherdess, and so suitable for her prince lover.&lt;ref&gt;Northrop Frye, "Recognition in ''The Winter's Tale''" p 108-9 ''Fables of Identity:  Studies in Poetic Mythology'', {{ISBN|0-15-629730-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literature and modern usage==
===Mystery===
The earliest use of anagnorisis in a [[Crime fiction|murder mystery]] was in "[[The Three Apples]]", a classical ''[[One Thousand and One Nights|Arabian Nights]]'' tale, where the device is employed to great effect in its [[twist ending]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Wikisource:The Tale of the Three Apples]]&lt;/ref&gt; The protagonist of the story, [[Ja'far ibn Yahya]], is ordered by [[Harun al-Rashid]] to find the culprit behind a murder mystery within three days or else be executed. It is only after the deadline has passed, and as he prepares to be executed, that he discovers that the culprit was his own slave all along.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Story-Telling Techniques in the Arabian Nights|first=David|last=Pinault|publisher=[[Brill Publishers]]|year=1992|isbn=90-04-09530-6|pages=95–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=The Arabian Nights Reader|first=Ulrich|last=Marzolph|publisher=[[Wayne State University Press]]|year=2006|isbn=0-8143-3259-5|pages=241–2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern usage===
Anagnorisis, however, is not limited to classical or Elizabethan sources. Author and lecturer Ivan Pintor Iranzo points out that contemporary ''auteur'' [[M. Night Shyamalan]] uses similar revelations in ''[[The Sixth Sense]]'', in which child psychologist Malcolm Crowe successfully treats a child who is having visions of dead people, only to realize at the close of the film that Crowe himself is dead, as well as in ''[[Unbreakable (film)|Unbreakable]]'', in which the character of David realizes that he survived a train crash that killed the other passengers, due to a supernatural power.&lt;ref name="formats"&gt;Ivan Pintor Iranzo. [http://www.upf.edu/materials/depeca/formats/arti6_ing.htm The naked and the dead. The Representation of the dead and the construction of the other in contemporary cinema: The case of M. Night Shyamalan], No. 4, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Another well known example of anagnorisis from popular culture is the revelation that [[Darth Vader]] is the father of [[Luke Skywalker]] in ''[[The Empire Strikes Back]]''. An extensive account of the history and application of anagnorisis is provided by Terence Cave in his book ''Recognitions''.&lt;ref&gt;''Recognitions: A Study in Poetics''. Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;

A humorous definition is included in 'The Banner: mock-heroic verse epic, Part 1: Sid' by Robin Gordon:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
In any moment of such crisis / 
one thinks, of course, of those devices / 
which Aristotle said were needed / 
in any poem.  We have heeded / 
Aristotle, and our plot, / 
(beginning, middle, end), has got / 
complications too, and error / 
fit to rouse cathartic terror, / 
protagonists, antagonists, / 
peripiteia, turns and twists. / 
The poet's comments form the choruses, / 
but now it's time for anagnorisis. / 
When Oedipus sees the bird he's bedded / 
is his own father's lawful wedded / 
wife, in fact she is his mother, / 
or Iphigenia finds her brother, / 
Discovery or Recognition / 
brings the plot to its fruition.

'''Ancient art''' refers to the many types of [[art]] produced by the advanced [[culture]]s of [[ancient]] societies with some form of writing, such as those of ancient [[China]], [[India]], [[Mesopotamia]], [[Ancient Persia|Persia]], [[Ancient Palestine|Palestine]], [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]], [[Ancient Greece|Greece]], and [[Ancient Rome|Rome]]. The art of pre-literate societies is normally referred to as [[Prehistoric art]] and is not covered here.  Although some [[Pre-Columbian cultures]] developed writing during the centuries before the arrival of Europeans, on grounds of dating these are covered at [[Pre-Columbian art]], and articles such as [[Maya art]] and [[Aztec art]]. [[Olmec]] art is mentioned below.

===Egypt===
{{main article|Art of ancient Egypt}}
[[File:Egypt.Papyrus.01.jpg|thumb|Egyptian papyrus]]

Due to the highly religious nature of ancient [[Ancient Egypt]]ian civilization, many of the great works of ancient Egypt depict gods, goddesses, and [[Pharaohs]], who were also considered divine. Ancient Egyptian art is characterized by the idea of order. Clear and simple lines combined with simple shapes and flat areas of color helped to create a sense of order and balance in the art of ancient Egypt. Ancient Egyptian artists used vertical and horizontal reference lines  to maintain the correct proportions in their work. Political and religious, as well as artistic, order was also maintained in Egyptian art. To clearly define the social hierarchy of a situation, figures were drawn to sizes that were based not on their distance from the painter's perspective but on relative importance. For instance, the Pharaoh would be drawn as the largest figure in a painting no matter where he was situated, and a greater God would be drawn larger than a lesser god.

Symbolism also played an important role in establishing a sense of order. Symbolism, ranging from the Pharaoh's regalia (symbolizing his power to maintain order) to the individual symbols of Egyptian gods and goddesses, was omnipresent in Egyptian art. Animals were usually also highly symbolic figures in Egyptian art. Color, as well, had extended meaning—blue and green represented the Nile and life; yellow stood for the sun god; and red represented power and vitality. The colors in Egyptian artifacts have survived extremely well over the centuries because of Egypt's dry climate.

Despite the stilted form caused by a lack of perspective, ancient Egyptian art is often highly realistic. Ancient Egyptian artists often show a sophisticated knowledge of anatomy and a close attention to detail, especially in their renderings of animals.
During the 18th Dynasty of Egypt a Pharaoh by the name of [[Akhenaton]] took the throne and abolished the traditional [[polytheism]]. He formed a monotheistic religion based on the worship of Aten, a sun god. Artistic change followed political upheaval. A new style of art was introduced that was more naturalistic than the stylized frieze favored in Egyptian art for the previous 1700 years. After Akhenaton's death, however, Egyptian artists reverted to their old styles.

[[Faience]] that was produced in [[History of ancient Egypt|ancient Egyptian]] antiquity as early as 3500 BC was in fact superior to the tin-glazed [[earthenware]] of the European 15th century.&lt;ref name="Friedman"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1026/is_n3_v154/ai_21146424|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041020082209/http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1026/is_n3_v154/ai_21146424|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2004-10-20|title=Ancient Egyptian faience|last=Friedman|first=Florence Dunn|date=September 1998|accessdate=2008-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ancient Egypt]]ian [[faience]] was not made of [[clay]] but instead actually of a [[ceramic]] composed primarily of [[quartz]].

===Mesopotamia===
{{main article|Art of Mesopotamia}}
[[Mesopotamia]] (from the Greek Μεσοποταμία "[land] between the rivers", in Syriac called ܒܝܬ ܢܗܪܝܢ pronounced "Beth Nahrain", "Land of rivers", rendered in Arabic as بلاد الرافدين bilād al-rāfidayn) is a toponym for the area of the [[Tigris]]-[[Euphrates]] river system, largely corresponding to modern-day Iraq, as well as some parts of northeastern Syria, southeastern Turkey, and southwestern Iran. Mesopotamia is often considered the "cradle of civilization." Within its boundaries, some of the most ancient civilizations known first developed [[writing]] and [[agriculture]]. Many civilizations flourished there, leaving behind a rich legacy of ancient art.

Widely considered to be the cradle of civilization, Bronze Age Mesopotamia included Sumer and the Akkadian, Babylonian and Assyrian empires. In the Iron Age, it was ruled by the Neo-Assyrian and Neo-Babylonian empires. The indigenous Sumerians and Akkadians (including Assyrians &amp; Babylonians) dominated Mesopotamia from the beginning of written history (c. 3100 BC) to the fall of Babylon in 539 BC, when it was conquered by the Achaemenid Empire. It fell to Alexander the Great in 332 BC and after his death it became part of the Greek Seleucid Empire.

Around 150 BC, Mesopotamia was under the control of the Parthians. Mesopotamia became a battleground between the Romans and Parthians, with parts of Mesopotamia (particularly Assyria) coming under periodic Roman control. In 226 AD, it fell to the Sassanid Persians, and remained under Persian rule until the 7th-century Arab Islamic conquest of the Sassanid Empire. A number of primarily Christian native Mesopotamian states existed between the 1st century BC and 3rd century AD, including Adiabene, Oshroene and Hatra. 
Etymology:
The regional toponym Mesopotamia (from the root words "meso" &lt; μέσος = middle and "potamia" &lt; ποταμός = river, literally "between rivers") was coined in the Hellenistic period to refer to a broad geographical area without definite boundaries, and was probably used by the Seleucids. The term biritum/birit narim corresponded to a similar geographical concept and was coined during the Aramaicization of the region, in the 10th century BC.

It is widely accepted, however, that early Mesopotamian societies simply referred to the entire alluvium by the Sumerian term kalam ("land"). More recently, terms like "Greater Mesopotamia" or "Syro-Mesopotamia" have been adopted to refer to wider geographies corresponding to the Near East or Middle East. These later euphemisms are Eurocentric terms attributed to the region in the midst of various 19th-century Western encroachments.

===Sumerian===
[[File:Ur chariot.jpg|thumb|200px|A [[chariot]] and rider from the ''[[Standard of Ur]]'', c. 2500 BC]]
Archaeological evidence attests to their existence during the [[5th millennium BC]]. The Sumerians decorated their [[pottery]] with [[cedar oil]] [[paint]]s. The Sumerians also developed [[jewelry]].

One of the most remarkable artifacts remaining from the Sumerian civilization is known as the ''[[Standard of Ur]]''. Dated to approximately 2500 B.C., the Standard is a wooden box inlaid with shells and [[lapis lazuli]]. It depicts, on one side, [[soldiers]] presenting their [[monarch|king]] with prisoners and, on the other side, [[peasant]]s presenting him with gifts—stunning evidence that attests to the vibrancy of art in this [[ancient]] [[culture]]. Sumer had made many great advances; for example, there is the wheel, which had made transportation easier for the Sumerians. The arch was the greatest architectural achievement of Sumer. The ziggurats were pyramid-shaped temples the Sumerian architects built. They believed that the gods lived at the tops of the temples. The kings would declare that the gods had sent them to rule, and the Sumerians would happily follow the king's laws. The king had many important jobs like leading the army and looking after irrigation, with which Sumerians could control rivers.  The rulers would have battles over land, and life went on for the Sumerians.

===Babylon===
The conquest of [[Sumer]] and [[Akkadian Empire|Akkad]] by [[Babylon]] marks a turning point in the artistic as well as political history of the region.

The Babylonians took advantage of the abundance of [[clay]] in [[Mesopotamia]] to create [[brick]]s. The use of brick led to the early development of the [[pilaster]] and [[column]], as well as of [[fresco]]es and enameled tiles. The walls were brilliantly coloured, and sometimes plated with [[bronze]] or [[gold]] as well as with tiles. Painted [[terra-cotta]] cones were also embedded in the plaster.

The sean were also great [[metal]]-workers, creating functional and beautiful tools with [[copper]]. It is possible that Babylonia was the original home of copper-working, which spread westward with the civilization to which it belonged. In addition, the want of stone in Babylonia made every pebble precious and led to a high perfection in the art of [[engraved gem|gem]]-cutting. The arts of Babylon also included [[tapestries]], and Babylonian civilization was from an early date famous for its embroideries and rugs.

===Assyria===
{{main article|Art and architecture of Assyria}}
[[File:Human-headed winged bull Khorsabad profile - Louvre 02b.jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[Assyria]]n statue]]
Like all other [[monarchy|kingdom]]s, the Babylonian kingdom did not last forever. When Babylon fell into decline it was eventually conquered by [[Assyria]], one of its former colonies, Assyria inherited its arts as well as its empire.

At first, Assyrian [[architect]]s and artists copied Babylonian styles and materials, but as time went by, however, the later Assyrians began to shake themselves free of Babylonian influences. The walls of the Assyrian palaces were lined with slabs of stone instead of brick, and were colored instead of painted as in [[Chaldea]]. In place of the [[bas relief]] we have [[sculpture|sculpted figures]], the earliest examples being the statues from [[Girsu]] which are realistic but somewhat clumsy.

No remarkable specimens of metallurgic art from early Assyria have been found, but at a later epoch great excellence was attained in the manufacture of such [[jewellery]] as ear-rings and bracelets of [[gold]]. [[Copper]] was also worked with skill.

The forms of Assyrian pottery were graceful; the [[porcelain]], like the [[glass]] discovered in the palaces of [[Nineveh]], was derived from [[Egypt]]ian originals. Transparent glass seems to have been first introduced in the reign of [[Sargon II]]. Stone as well as clay and glass were employed in the manufacture of vases. Vases of hard stone have been disinterred at Tello similar to those of the early dynastic period of Egypt.

Ashurbanipal had promoted art and culture and had a vast library of cuneiform tablets at Nineveh.

[[File:Knossos fresco women.jpg|thumb|300px|Fresco showing three women]]

===The Minoan Civilization===
{{Main article|Minoan pottery}}
The greatest civilization of the [[Bronze Age]] was that of the [[Minoan civilization|Minoans]], a mercantilist people who built a trading empire from their homeland of [[Crete]] and from other Aegean islands. Minoan civilization was known for its beautiful [[ceramics (art)|ceramics]], but also for its [[fresco]]s, [[landscape]]s, and stone carvings. In the early Minoan period, ceramics were characterized by spirals, triangles, curved lines, crosses, and fishbone motifs. In the middle Minoan period, naturalistic designs such as fish, squid, birds, and lilies were common. In the late Minoan period, flowers and animals were still the most characteristic, but variability had increased. The 'palace style' of the region around [[Knossos]] is characterized by strong geometric simplification of naturalistic shapes and by [[monochromatic]] painting. The Palace at Knossos was decorated with frescoes that showed aspects of daily life, including court ritual and entertainment such as bull-leaping and [[boxing]]. The [[Minoans]] were also skilled [[gold]]smiths who created beautiful pendants and masks.

===The Mycenaean Civilization===
[[Mycenae]]an art is close to the Minoan and includes many splendid finds from the royal graves, most famously the [[Mask of Agamemnon]], a gold funeral mask. As may be seen from this item, the Mycenaeans specialized in gold-working. Their artworks are known for a plethora of decorative motifs employed. At some point in their cultural history, the Mycenaeans adopted the Minoan goddesses and associated these goddesses with their sky-god; scholars believe that the Greek pantheon of deities does not reflect Mycenaean religion except for the goddesses and Zeus. These goddesses, however, are Minoan in origin.

===Greek art===
{{Main article|Ancient Greek art}}

[[File:Thebeskouros.jpg|thumb|200px|right|[[Kouros]] of the [[Archaic Greece|Archaic period]], Thebes Archaeological Museum]]
Ancient Greek art includes much pottery, sculpture as well as architecture. Greek sculpture is known for the [[contrapposto]] standing of the figures. The art of Ancient Greece is usually divided stylistically into three periods: the Archaic, the Classical and the Hellenistic. The history of Ancient Greek pottery is divided stylistically into periods: the Protogeometric, the Geometric, the Late Geometric or Archaic, the Black Figure and the Red Figure. Ancient Greek art has survived most successfully in the forms of sculpture and architecture, as well as in such minor arts as coin design, pottery and gem engraving.

The most prestigious form of Ancient Greek painting was [[panel painting]], now known only from literary descriptions; they perished rapidly after the 4th century AD, when they were no longer actively protected. Today not much survives of Greek painting, except for late [[Fayum mummy portraits|mummy paintings]] and a few paintings on the walls of tombs, mostly in Macedonia and Italy. Painting on pottery, of which a great deal survives, gives some sense of the aesthetics of Greek painting. The techniques involved, however, were very different from those used in large-format painting. It was mainly in black and [[gold]] and was painted using different paints than the ones used on walls or wood, because it was a different surface.

===India===

[[File:StandingBuddha.jpg|thumb|right|180px|A sculpture of [[Siddhārtha Gautama]] the founder of [[Buddhism]]]]

The first sculptures in [[India]] date back to the [[Indus Valley civilization]] some 5,000 years ago, where small stone carvings and bronze castings have been discovered. Later, as [[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]] and [[Jainism]] developed further, India produced some of the most intricate bronzes in the world, as well as unrivaled temple carvings, some in huge shrines, such as the one at [[Ellora Caves|Ellora]].

The [[Ajanta Caves]] in [[Maharashtra]], India are [[Rock cut architecture|rock-cut]] cave monuments dating back to the second century [[BCE]] and containing paintings and sculpture considered to be masterpieces of both Buddhist religious art and universal pictorial art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/242|title=Ajanta Caves|publisher=UNESCO World Heritage Centre|accessdate=2008-12-22| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081218043116/http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/242| archivedate= 18 December 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Persia (Iran)===
{{main article|Persian art}}
[[File:Takht-jamshid.jpg|thumb|left|300px|After 2500 years, the ruins of Persepolis still inspire visitors from far and near.]]
[[Iran]] succeeded to the [[Hittite Empire]] and initially took much of its artistic styles from them. Huge palaces in rural settings, often worked on by craftsmen drawn from other nations, subject or not, were distinctive features. After the Empire was decisively overthrown by [[Alexander the Great]] a new [[Sassanian]] culture emerged, notable for palaces and metalwork. The capitals [[Susa]], [[Persepolis]], Ecbatana and Estakhr have revealed much rich Persian art.

===Rome===
{{main article|Roman art}}
{{further|Pompeian Styles|Roman Wall Painting (200 BC-79 AD)}}
It is commonly said that Roman art was derivative from Greek and [[Etruscan art]]. Indeed, the villas of the wealthy Romans unearthed in [[Pompeii]] and [[Herculaneum]] show a strong predilection for all things Greek. Many of the most significant Greek artworks survive by virtue of their Roman interpretation and imitation. Roman artists sought to commemorate great events in the life of their state and to glorify their emperors as well as record the inner life of people, and express ideas of beauty and nobility. Their busts, and especially the images of individuals on gravestones, are very expressive and lifelike, finished with skill and panache.

In Greece and Rome, wall painting was not considered as high art. The most prestigious form of art besides sculpture was panel painting, i.e. tempera or [[encaustic painting]] on wooden panels. Unfortunately, since wood is a perishable material, only a very few examples of such paintings have survived, namely the Severan Tondo from circa 200 AD, a very routine official portrait from some provincial government office, and the well-known Fayum mummy portraits, all from Roman Egypt, and almost certainly not of the highest contemporary quality. The portraits were attached to burial mummies at the face, from which almost all have now been detached. They usually depict a single person, showing the head, or head and upper chest, viewed frontally. The background is always monochrome, sometimes with decorative elements. In terms of artistic tradition, the images clearly derive more from Greco-Roman traditions than Egyptian ones. They are remarkably realistic, though variable in artistic quality, and may indicate the similar art which was widespread elsewhere but did not survive. A few portraits painted on glass and medals from the later empire have survived, as have coin portraits, some of which are considered very realistic as well. [[Pliny the Younger]] complained of the declining state of Roman portrait art, "The painting of portraits which used to transmit through the ages the accurate likenesses of people, has entirely gone out…Indolence has destroyed the arts."

===Japan===
{{further information|Japanese art}}
The eras of Japanese art correspond to the locations of various governments. The earliest known Japanese artifacts are attributable to the Aniu tribe, who influenced the Jōmon people, and these eras came to be known as the [[Jōmon]] and [[Yayoi]] time periods. Before the Yayoi invaded Japan, Jimmu in 660 B.C. was the crowned emperor. Later came the Haniwa of the Kofun era, then the Asuka when Buddhism reached Japan from China. The religion influenced Japanese art significantly for centuries thereafter.&lt;ref&gt;http://blog.art.com/wiki/japanese-art/&lt;/ref&gt;

===China===
{{Main article|Chinese art}}

Prehistoric artwork such as painted pottery in [[Neolithic]] China can be traced back to the [[Yangshao culture]] and [[Longshan culture]] of the Yellow River valley. During China's [[Bronze Age]], Chinese of the ancient [[Shang Dynasty]] and [[Zhou Dynasty]] produced multitudes of artistic bronzeware vessels for practical purposes, but also for religious ritual and [[geomancy]]. The earliest (surviving) Chinese paintings date to the [[Warring States]] period, and they were on [[silk]] as well as [[lacquerware]]s.

One of ancient China's most famous artistic relics remains the [[Terracotta warriors]], an assembly of 8,099 individual and life-size terracotta figures (such as infantry, horses with chariots and cavalry, archers, and military officers), buried in the tomb of [[Qin Shi Huang]], the First Qin Emperor, in 210 BC. This tradition was carried into the subsequent [[Han Dynasty]], although their tombs contained miniature versions of the soldiers in addition to domestic servants to serve rulers and nobility in the afterlife. Chinese art arguably shows more continuity between ancient and modern periods than that of any other civilization, as even when foreign dynasties took the Imperial throne they did not impose new cultural or religious habits and were relatively quickly assimilated.

===Olmec art===
The ancient [[Olmec]] "Bird Vessel" and bowl, both [[pottery|ceramic]] and dating to circa 1000 BC as well as other [[Ceramics (art)|ceramics]] are produced in [[kiln]]s capable of exceeding approximately 900&amp;nbsp;°C. The only other [[prehistory|prehistoric]] culture known to have achieved such high temperatures is that of [[Ancient Egypt]].&lt;ref name="Friedman"/&gt;

Much Olmec art is highly stylized and uses an iconography reflective of the religious meaning of the artworks. Some Olmec art, however, is surprisingly naturalistic, displaying an accuracy of depiction of human anatomy perhaps equaled in the pre-Columbian New World only by the best Maya Classic era art. Olmec art-forms emphasize monumental statuary and small [[jade]] carvings. A common theme is to be found in representations of a divine [[jaguar]]. [[Olmec figurine]]s were also found abundantly through their period.

'''April Branning''' is a [[fictional character]] from the [[BBC]] [[soap opera]] ''[[EastEnders]]'', played by [[Debbie Arnold]]. April  is introduced as the sister of established character [[Carol Jackson]] ([[Lindsey Coulson]]).

==Storylines==
April arrives in [[Albert Square]] in December 1995 to invite Carol and her boyfriend [[Alan Jackson (EastEnders)|Alan]] ([[Howard Antony]]) to her wedding. April had been living and working in [[Greece]] for eight years selling time-share apartments, where she met and got engaged to a native named Nikos. Carol initially refuses the invitation as she knows that her black boyfriend will not be well received by her [[racist]] father, [[Jim Branning]] ([[John Bardon]]). However, Alan decides that he wants to go so April enlists her niece [[Sonia Fowler|Sonia]] ([[Natalie Cassidy]]) as bridesmaid.

The ceremony is due to take place in April 1996 but just at the last minute the groom's best man turns up with the news that Nikos has fled back to Greece, leaving April distraught and humiliated. The day isn't a complete waste though as Alan and Carol get married in their place.

April returns to [[Walford]] in July to visit her sister, and after meeting the market inspector [[Michael Rose (EastEnders)|Michael Rose]] ([[Russell Floyd]]), to whom she is attracted to, she decides to stay. She gets herself a job working in [[Kathy Beale]] ([[Gillian Taylforth]])'s café, where she is witness to her brother-in-law's flirtations with the vindictive [[Frankie Pierre]] ([[Syan Blake]]). When it becomes obvious that Frankie is involved with Alan, April informs Carol, which eventually leads to the end of Alan and Carol's relationship.

April and Michael's relationship continues over the next few months and eventually Michael falls in love and begs April to move in with him. April is unsure whether she wants to take such a big step, and while she is considering what to do, her ex, Nikos, shows up and tries to worm his way back into her affections. He demands to marry her and despite the fact that he had previously jilted her at the altar, April decides to give him another chance. She leaves Walford with him and manages to get him down the aisle, leaving Michael to marshal his stalls and mull over what might have been.

April's last appearance is in October 1996. Eleven years later it is revealed that April is still living in [[Greece]], and is unable to attend her nephew [[Bradley Branning|Bradley]] ([[Charlie Clements]])'s wedding to [[Stacey Slater]] ([[Lacey Turner]]). Following Jim's death in 2015, April's brother [[Max Branning]] ([[Jake Wood]]) declared during his eulogy that his sisters hated Jim so much they did not make any effort to attend his funeral.

==Character creation and development==
The character of April Branning, played by Debbie Arnold, is introduced in December 1995 as the "fun-loving" sister of [[Carol Jackson]] ([[Lindsey Coulson]]).&lt;ref name="april"&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-61312816.html|title= EASTENDERS SIREN DEBBIE IS QUITTING; Final scene is steamy fling|publisher=''[[Daily Mirror|The Mirror]]''  | date = 1996-08-30| accessdate=2008-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her entrance storyline is part of a plot that leads to the marriage of Carol and her boyfriend [[Alan Jackson (EastEnders)|Alan]] ([[Howard Antony]]) - when April is jilted at the altar, Carol and Alan marry in her place. The character was turned into a regular in 1996, moving to the soap's setting of Albert Square.

At the time, Jaci Stephen, television critic for ''The Mirror'' described April as a kind of character "who, from the moment they open their mouths, appear to have been around for ever." She added, "She has bleached blonde hair, overdresses and has the kind of flirtatious manner guaranteed to drive the Square's women to violence. As April grows more glamorous  [[Cindy Beale|Cindy]] ([[Michelle Collins]]) grows more dowdy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-61307997.html|title= April reigns as new queen of the Square|publisher=''[[Daily Mirror|The Mirror]]''  | date = 1996-01-03| accessdate=2008-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

April's most high-profile storyline is a romance with market inspector [[Michael Rose (EastEnders)|Michael Rose]] ([[Russell Floyd]]). In August 1996, less than a year after her arrival, it was announced that actress Debbie Arnold was quitting her role as April Branning, despite previously being quoted as saying "If they try to get rid of me, I'll chain myself to the railings of Albert Square."&lt;ref name="april"/&gt;  Arnold reportedly said, "I want to move on" and a friend of hers is quoted as saying " Debbie has already appeared in ''[[Coronation Street]]'' and ''[[Emmerdale]]''. She's terrified of getting in a rut and wants to try her hand at other TV work - she's had plenty of offers already."&lt;ref name="april"/&gt;

It was reported at the time that April's leaving storyline would revolve around an affair with her sister's husband Alan Jackson.&lt;ref name="april"/&gt;  According to ''The Mirror'', "the show's bosses are planning a sensational storyline for her departure - April will start a steamy affair with her screen sister's husband Alan, played by Howard Anthony. But his missus finds out and viewers will be treated to an emotional confrontation between the two. April ends up packing her bags and leaving the Square because she still holds a torch for her brother-in-law."&lt;ref name="april"/&gt;  This proved to be false, and April instead departed after dumping Michael Rose and reuniting with her former lover to start a new life in Greece. She last appeared in October 1996.

==Reception==
Actress Debbie Arnold was reportedly popular in the role of April, receiving 400 letters from fans in two weeks.&lt;ref name="april"/&gt;

Lee was born in [[Southwell, Nottinghamshire]] and attended [[Trinity College, Cambridge]], graduating in 1899 and subsequently qualified as a solicitor before becoming a director of the Sheffield cutlery manufacturers Walker &amp; Hall. He was a territorial officer with the [[Sherwood Foresters]] from 1903 and on the outbreak of [[World War One]] was mobilised with his regiment and sent to the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]]. In 1916 he served as a Major in Dublin where the Foresters suffered heavy losses during the [[Easter Rising]] and was awarded the DSO. He was then transferred to the HQ of the British Expeditionary Force as a Lieutenant-Colonel where he was appointed military censor. He had several well-recorded disputes with war artists, particularly [[William Orpen]] and [[Christopher Nevinson]] whose ''Paths of Glory'' Lee attempted to censor. Nevinson, however, still exhibited the work at a London exhibition in 1918 with a piece of brown paper across it bearing the word "Censored". Lee was awarded an OBE for his war work.&lt;ref name=IWMpaths&gt;{{cite web |author=Imperial War Museum|url=http://www.iwm.org.uk/collections/item/object/20211|title=''Paths of Glory'' by CRW Nevinson |year=|accessdate=6 May 2017|work=[[Imperial War Museum]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
After the war, Lee returned to Sheffield and his cutlery firm.

'''Aspazija''' was the [[pen name]] of '''Elza Johanna Emilija Lizete Pliekšāne''' (née '''Elza Rozenberga'''; 16 March 1865 – 5 November 1943), a [[Latvia]]n [[poet]] and [[playwright]]. Aspazija is the [[Latvian language|Latvian]] transliteration of [[Aspasia]].

== Biography ==
Aspazija was born and raised in a wealthy peasant family near [[Jelgava]] in 1865, where she studied and was active in youth organizations. She left gymnasium during the last year of studies, and in 1886 married Wilhelm Max  Valter. Later she became interested in [[literature]], mainly by German authors. Her first publication appeared in 1887 in the newspaper ''Dienas Lapa''. In 1891 she divorced her husband and until 1893 worked as a private teacher in [[Jaunsvirlauka parish|Jaunsvirlauka]]. In 1893 she settled in [[Riga]] and started to work as [[journalist]]. In 1894 her first plays ''Vaidelote'' and ''Zaudētās tiesības'' were staged in Riga.&lt;ref name=r1/&gt;&lt;ref name=r2/&gt;

In those years she met Jānis Pliekšāns (better known as [[Rainis]]), a newspaper editor, poet, lawyer, and a leader of the [[New Current]] (Jaunā strāva) movement. Under his influence Aspazija joined the New Current. The couple married in 1897, when they moved to [[Panevėžys]], [[Lithuania]], after the crackdown of New Current. The same year she published her first collection of poetry. For his activities Rainis was imprisoned and later sentenced to five years in exile in  [[Russian Empire|Russia]] from 1897–1903, and Aspazija followed him. Together they translated into Latvian many works of [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]]. Later they returned to Latvia and continued writing, while Rainis also participated in socialist politics.&lt;ref name=r1/&gt;&lt;ref name=r2/&gt;
 
The [[1905 Revolution]] began with protests in St. Petersburg in January. Within days protests spread to Riga and many were killed on 13 January 1905. Aspazija's play "Vaidelote" (The Vestal) opened in January and was interpreted as a breakup call from the Imperialist Russia. (Rainis also published  a collection of revolutionary poems, ''Vētras Sēja'' (''The Sowing of the Storm'').) The czar ordered a crack-down, and many revolutionaries were arrested and killed in 1905-6. Therefore, Rainis and Aspazija fled to [[Switzerland]] and lived in exile in [[Castagnola]] from 1905 to 1920.&lt;ref name=r1/&gt;&lt;ref name=r2/&gt; 

When they returned to independent Latvia after [[World War I]], Aspazija was active in the [[feminism|feminist]] movement. She also joined the [[Latvian Social Democratic Workers' Party]] and was elected to the [[Constitutional Assembly of Latvia|constitutional assembly]]. After Rainis died in 1929 Aspazija lived very privately in Riga or in her summer house in Dubulti. She died in 5 November 1943 in Dubulti and was buried in the Rainis cemetery in Riga, next to her husband.&lt;ref name=r1/&gt;&lt;ref name=r2/&gt;
[[File:Aspazijas nams Dubultos.JPG|thumb|Aspazija's summer home in [[Dubulti]]]]

== Literary works ==

Aspazija's first works are [[Literary realism|realistic]], but most of her work is [[Neo-romanticism|neo-romantic]]. Some are a nostalgic look to the past. For example, the play ''Vaidelote'' (a female servant to gods in [[Lithuanian mythology]]), written in 1894, takes place in the 14th century [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]]. The plays ''Simple Rights'' and ''Unattained Goals'' provoked many discussions because of their protest against the [[Patriarchy|patriarchal]] society.&lt;!--of which country?--&gt; The play ''Silver Veil'' (''Sidraba šķidrauts'') is considered to be her best work. In 1923 she wrote a play titled ''Aspazija''.&lt;ref name=r1/&gt;&lt;ref name=r2/&gt;

In the poetry compilation ''Red Flowers'', simple and ordinary things are viewed in a romantic light. At the same time, her poems are full of light, fantasy, and rebellious moods. In ''Soul's Twilight'' (1904), pessimistic moods take over.&lt;ref name=r1/&gt;&lt;ref name=r2/&gt;

While living abroad, Aspazija wrote the poetry compilations ''Sunny Corner'' and ''Spread Wings'', which have fewer social aspects and more intimate text, less rebellion against society, and more personal feelings.&lt;ref name=r1/&gt;&lt;ref name=r2/&gt;

'''''Assunta Spina''''' is a 1915 Italian [[silent film]]. Outside [[Italy]], it is sometimes known as ''Sangue Napolitano'' ("Neapolitan Blood").

==Plot==
Assunta Spina is a laundress living in [[Naples]], engaged to a violent butcher named Michele Mangiafuoco. She is also courted intensely by Raffaele. When she accepts Raffaele's offer to dance during an open air feast in [[Posillipo]] because she feels Michele is ignoring her, tragedy strikes. Michele, blinded by rage, slashes her face and is subsequently arrested. During the trial she bears witness in order to rescue him, saying he never wounded her, but the jury does not believe her. She is enticed by the court vice-chancellor to strike a bargain—Michele will stay in the nearby prison of [[Naples]] instead of [[Avellino]], and at the end of the punishment Michele will kill the vice-chancellor before Assunta's eyes.  She must take responsibility for the act before the eyes of the police in order to save her man.

==Production==
The original novel from which the story was taken was written by [[Salvatore di Giacomo]], and had been adapted to a successful theatre drama in 1909. Before [[Francesca Bertini]] became a famous actress, she would perform in this drama as a walk-on in the laundry scenes. Five years later, when she had started her career as a film actress, she and actor-director [[Gustavo Serena]] adapted the drama for film.  Bertini is sometimes listed as co-director of the film. Bertini claimed with some support that she was the director of the film.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://wfpp.cdrs.columbia.edu/pioneer/francesca-bertini/|title=Francesca Bertini – Women Film Pioneers Project|website=wfpp.cdrs.columbia.edu|access-date=2018-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The film stock was colorized with 4 colors and distributed worldwide by [[Caesar Film]].{{Fact|date=December 2014}}

Francesca Bertini fully displayed her talent for the first time, introducing a new style of acting on the Italian [[silver screen]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Her performance is generally rated as extraordinary, and in polar opposition to the work of writer and dramatist [[Gabriele D'Annunzio]] who was very popular at the time.

[[File:Assunta Spina (1915 film).jpg|left|thumb|Scene from ''Assunta Spina'']]
For example, the movie ''[[Cabiria]]'' by [[Giovanni Pastrone]] (1914)—one of the first known films where a camera moves through scenes while filming—was once considered a masterpiece at least in part because D'Annunzio had written the captions, but to modern moviegoers they seem excessively emphatic and redundant.  The same can be said of the marked gestures of many actors and actresses of the silent era.  Bertini wanted to end this affected behavior, so she focused on [[Realism (dramatic arts)|realism]].  Her performances bear a closer resemblance to reality because of some acting devices: never look into the camera, use everyday gestures, and so on. The lunch scene in ''Assunta Spina'', for example, still has impact because of these devices.  The attempt to reflect reality also reduced the need for captions explaining the action.  Even though only a single year passed between the release of ''Cabiria'' and ''Assunta Spina'', there seems to be at least a decade's worth of difference in artistic subtlety and nuance.

==Other versions==
In 1930 the plot of ''[[Assunta Spina (1930 film)|Assunta Spina]]'' inspired a new film by [[Roberto Roberti]]. [[Assunta Spina (1948 film)|Another was produced]] in 1948, directed by [[Mario Mattoli]], with [[Anna Magnani]] and [[Eduardo De Filippo]] as the protagonists.

The '''Australian Girls Own Gallery''' (aGOG) was a commercial gallery that operated in Leichhardt Street, [[Kingston, Australian Capital Territory|Kingston]] in [[Canberra]] from 1989 to 1998. The gallery was owned and operated by former [[National Gallery of Australia]] curator Helen Maxwell.

The gallery was significant because it only represented women artists (although towards the end of its operations the work of men would be very rarely exhibited). Maxwell started the gallery because she felt as that there was a bias against women artists within the art world and she 'felt strongly that women didn't get enough of a voice'.&lt;ref&gt;Alexandra Bellis Alison Dell, "A Place Good for the Spirit", ''Canberra Times'', 5 October 1989, 21.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first exhibition at aGOG was ''Les femmes formidables 1'' which ran from 16 March – 19 April 1989 and featured the work of five female artists: Banduk Marika, [[Barbara Hanrahan]], Joyce Allen, Lidia Groblika and Kate Lohse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article120915840 |title=Fringe festival program |newspaper=[[The Canberra Times]] |volume=63 |issue=19,512 |date=11 March 1989 |page=14 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; Art historian and art critic Sasha Grishin noted that the represented artists 'form an important cross-section of contemporary women printmakers in Australia'.&lt;ref&gt;Sasha Grishin, "'Les Femmes' a Good Start for Girl's Own Gallery", ''Canberra Times'', 29 March 1989&lt;/ref&gt;

aGOG would exhibit several group and solo shows each year. Represented artists included: [[Vivienne Binns]], Pam Debenham, [[Judy Horacek]], Marie McMahon, Patsy Payne, Mitzi Shearer, Ruth Waller, and [[Judy Watson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://australianartnetwork.com.au/category/artists/judy-watson/?filter_types=3610 |title=Judy Watson |website=australianartnetwork.com.au |publisher=Australian Art Network |accessdate=13 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After closing aGOG in 1998, Maxwell went on to open Helen Maxwell Gallery in [[Braddon, Australian Capital Territory|Braddon]], Canberra, which represented both male and female artists and was closed in 2010.

'''Bayati''' ({{lang-az|Bayatı}}) is one of the oldest forms of [[Azerbaijani people|Azerbaijani]] folk poetry. A bayati consists of four lines, each of which has  seven syllables.  The rhyme scheme is aaba. Anonymous bayati have been collected as folk wisdom in editions such as ''Xalqimizin deyimlari va duyumlari'' (Our people's sayings and feelings). Bayati can also be strung together in sequence to form longer poems, and there are several bayati dastan, epics, in which all of the verses are bayati; one example is ''Arzu-Qamber''.&lt;ref name="Oldfield"/&gt;

Some folklorists associate the bayati with women's folk creativity, but male [[ashig]]s compose bayati as well. Intriguingly, some scholars argue that the bayati dastan are from a lost repertoire of women's dastan, but so far there is no firm evidence to support this theory. In the [[Zaqatala Rayon|Zagatala]] region of northern [[Azerbaijan]], male and female ashiqs who play the [[tanbur]] sing poetry composed only in the bayati meter.&lt;ref name="Oldfield"&gt;Anna C. Oldfield. Azerbaijani Women Poet-minstrels: Women Ashiqs from the Eighteenth Century to the Present. Edwin Mellen Press, 2008. P. 60.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Expert needed|Sociology|ex2=Anthropology|talk=Limited cultural and temporal context|reason=the article discusses bedtime stories only in the context of contemporary Western culture|date=January 2018}}
A '''bedtime story''' is a traditional form of [[storytelling]], where a  [[Narrative|story]] is told to a [[child]] at [[bedtime]] to prepare the child for [[sleep]]. The bedtime story has long been considered "a definite institution in many families".&lt;ref name=institution&gt;Dickson, Marguerite Stockman (1919). ''Vocational Guidance for Girls''. p. 90–93.&lt;/ref&gt;

Reading bedtime stories yields multiple benefits for parents and children alike. The fixed routine of a bedtime story before sleeping can improve the child's brain development, language mastery, and logical thinking skills.&lt;ref name=parents&gt;Jones, Patti (2011).

''Parents Magazine''.&lt;/ref&gt; The storyteller-listener relationship creates an emotional bond between the parent and the child.&lt;ref name=parents/&gt; Due to "the strength of the imitative instinct" of a child, the parent and the stories that they tell act as a model for the child to follow.&lt;ref name=institution/&gt;

Bedtime stories are also useful for teaching the child abstract virtues such as [[sympathy]], [[unselfishness]], and [[self-control]], as most children are said to be "naturally sympathetic when they have experienced or can imagine the feelings of others".&lt;ref name=institution/&gt; Thus, bedtime stories can be used to discuss darker subjects such as [[death]] and [[racism]].&lt;ref name=parents/&gt; As the bedtime stories broaden in theme, the child "will broaden in their conception of the lives and feelings of others".&lt;ref name=institution/&gt;

[[File:CrossingTheWater.jpg|thumb|First edition (UK)]]
'''''Crossing the Water''''' is a 1971 posthumous collection of poetry by [[Sylvia Plath]] that was prepared for publication by [[Ted Hughes]]. These are transitional poems that were written along with the poems that appear in her poetic opus, ''Ariel''. The collection was published in the United Kingdom by Faber &amp; Faber (1975) and in the United States by Harper &amp; Row (1976).

The poems here tend to dwell on one's state of being in an environment. "Wuthering Heights," for example, details a walk that Plath takes along the Yorkshire moors where [[Emily Brontë]] once trekked, Finisterre is a stormy island where Plath and her family once visited and "Among the Narcissi" describes Plath's similarities at being among asexual vegetation.

The neighborhood is bounded by [[Brooklyn Bridge Park]] to the north, the [[Brooklyn Bridge]] to the west, [[Brooklyn Heights]] to the south and Vinegar Hill to the east. Dumbo is part of [[Brooklyn Community Board 2]].

The area was originally a [[ferry]] landing, characterized by 19th- and early 20th-century industrial and warehouse buildings, [[Sett (paving)|Belgian block]] streets, and its location on the East River by the imposing anchorage of the Manhattan Bridge. The entirety of Dumbo was bought by developer [[David Walentas]] and his company Two Trees Management in the late 20th century, and remade into an upscale residential and commercial community—first becoming a haven for art [[Art museum|galleries]], and currently a center for technology [[Startup company|startups]].

The large community of tech startups earned DUMBO the nickname of "the center of the Brooklyn Tech Triangle". In that time, Dumbo had become Brooklyn's most expensive neighborhood, as well as New York City's fourth-richest community overall; this is owing in part to its large concentration of technology [[Startup company|startups]], its close proximity to Manhattan, and its large number of former industrial buildings that have been converted into spacious [[luxury real estate|luxury]] residential [[lofts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=Nonko | first=Emily | title=The 8 Most Expensive Neighborhoods in New York City | website=New York.com | date=January 27, 2015 | url=http://www.newyork.com/articles/real-estate/the-most-expensive-neighborhoods-in-new-york-city-75971 | accessdate=November 7, 2015 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151029075613/http://www.newyork.com/articles/real-estate/the-most-expensive-neighborhoods-in-new-york-city-75971/ | archivedate=October 29, 2015 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The neighborhood is the corporate headquarters for e-commerce retailer [[Etsy]] and home furnishing stores company [[West Elm]].

Several other New York City neighborhoods are known by [[portmanteau]]s, including [[Tribeca]], [[SoHo, Manhattan|SoHo]], [[NoHo, Manhattan|NoHo]], [[NoMad]], and [[Nolita]] in Manhattan, and [[BoCoCa]] in Brooklyn.&lt;ref name="dolkart"&gt;{{Cite book |last1=Dolkart |first1=Andrew S. |url=http://home2.nyc.gov/html/lpc/downloads/pdf/reports/DUMBO_Designation_Report.pdf |title=DUMBO Historic District Designation Report |publisher=[[New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission]] |date=December 18, 2007 |accessdate=September 6, 2015|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nyt2007-12-25"/&gt;

==History==
The area has been known variously as Rapailie, Olympia, and Walentasville.&lt;ref name="DumboNYC"&gt;{{cite web |title=About Dumbo |url=http://dumbonyc.com/about |work=Dumbo NYC, Brooklyn |publisher=DumboNYC.com |accessdate=December 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "Olympia" name came from [[Comfort Sands|Comfort]] and [[Joshua Sands (politician)|Joshua Sands]], who bought the land in 1787&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Olympia Settlement in Early Brooklyn|last = |first = |publisher = |year = 1929|isbn = |location = New York|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; and were planning to develop the land as a summer place for New Yorkers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Dictionary of American Biography|last = Johnson|first = Allen|publisher = Charles Scribner’s Sons|year = 1964|isbn = |location = New York|pages = 341–342}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through the 18th and 19th centuries, the area now known as Dumbo was considered part of [[Vinegar Hill, Brooklyn|Vinegar Hill]].&lt;ref name="HISTORICAL DISTRICTS 1966"&gt;{{Cite journal|date=1966|title=HISTORICAL DISTRICTS|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/20780654|journal=Real Property, Probate and Trust Journal|volume=1|issue=3|pages=204–211}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1890s, the western portion of the neighborhood was known as [[Fulton Landing]], after the [[ferry]] stop that connected it to Manhattan before the [[Brooklyn Bridge]] opened. At that time, it was primarily a manufacturing district, with warehouses and factories that made machinery, paper boxes and [[Brillo]] soap pads. The area has been known variously as Rapailie, Olympia, and Walentasville.&lt;ref name="DumboNYC"/&gt; The [[cardboard box]] was invented in the Robert Gair building on Washington Street by Robert Gair, a Scottish emigrant; because of Gair's fame, the area was known as Gairsville for a long time.&lt;ref name="DumboNYC"/&gt; The Gair building is now home to [[Etsy]].&lt;ref name="usa"/&gt;&gt;

The [[Jay Street Connecting Railroad]] ran through Dumbo's waterfront from circa 1904–1906 through 1957. It ran from rail yards beneath the Manhattan and Brooklyn Bridges to buildings near the waterfront in Dumbo and Vinegar Hill. At the height of operations, it had spurs into several buildings, a [[car float bridge]] on Bridge Street, and a yard with capacity of 120 cars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Jay Street Terminal / Jay Street Connecting Railroad | website=TrainWeb.org | date=November 30, 2017 | url=http://members.trainweb.com/bedt/indloco/jst.html | access-date=November 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NYPress-JSC-2003&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nypress.com/the-jay-street-connecting-railroad/|title=The Jay Street Connecting Railroad|first=William|last=Bryk|date=April 22, 2003|work=NY Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tracks were abandoned in 1959,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=RAIL LINE TO END ITS BROOKLYN RUN; Jay Street Connecting Road Allowed to Discontinue Operations in Harbor | website=The New York Times | date=April 16, 1959 | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1959/04/16/archives/rail-line-to-end-its-brooklyn-run-jay-street-connecting-road.html | access-date=November 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; though the railroad's tracks are still visible on streets in Dumbo.&lt;ref name=NYPress-JSC-2003/&gt;

With the [[deindustrialization]] of New York City, Dumbo began to become primarily residential; artists and other young homesteaders seeking relatively large and inexpensive [[loft apartment]] spaces for studios and homes began moving there in the late 1970s.&lt;ref name="nyt2007-12-25"/&gt; The acronym "Dumbo" arose in 1978, when new residents coined it in the belief such an unattractive name would help deter developers.&lt;ref name="nyt2007-12-25"/&gt;

Near the end of the 20th century, as property became more and more expensive in Manhattan, Dumbo became increasingly [[gentrification|gentrified]]. Even so, the acronym 'Dumbo' was largely unknown as late as 1997, and the area itself was very inclusive, serving mainly as an enclave for artists located along the [[East River]] and under the [[Manhattan Bridge]]. At this stage there were still many air conditioner repair shops, auto shops, and "seedy back alleys and wharves"; and, because the neighborhood was still gentrifying from its industrial past, it lacked even a bookstore, coffee shop, or [[Self-service laundry|laundromat]].&lt;ref name="nyt 19971010"&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0CE3DC153CF933A25753C1A961958260&amp;pagewanted=all "As It Turns Artistic, A Noirish Enclave Steps Into the Light"].

The DUMBO Historic District, a historic industrial complex and national [[Historic district (United States)|historic district]] in Dumbo, was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 2000.&lt;ref name="nris"/&gt; It consists of 95 contributing buildings; the manufacturing concerns located in this district included [[Benjamin Moore &amp; Co.]] (paint), Arbuckle Brothers (coffee and sugar), J.W.

Orchestras are one of the largest [[musical ensemble]]s, as they can contain as many as 100 musicians.

'''Economics of the arts and literature'''  or '''cultural economics''' (used below for convenience) is a branch of economics that studies the economics of creation, distribution, and the consumption of [[work of art|works of art]], literature and similar creative and/or cultural products.   For a long time, the concept of the "arts" were confined to visual arts (e.g., painting) and performing arts (music, theatre, dance) in the Anglo-Saxon tradition. Usage has widened since the beginning of the 1980s with the study of [[cultural industry]] (cinema, television programs, book and periodical publishing and music publishing) and the economy of cultural institutions (museums, libraries, historic buildings).  The field is coded as [[JEL classification codes#Other special topics (economics) JEL: Z Subcategories|JEL: Z11]] in the ''[[Journal of Economic Literature]]'' [[JEL classification codes|classification system]] used for article searches.&lt;ref&gt;In the JEL system, '[[Cultural economics|Cultural Economics]]' is a [[JEL classification codes#Other special topics (economics) JEL: Z Subcategories|broader category]] than used in this article.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Introduction ==
[[File:Alejandro Plaza.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Painter Alejandro Plaza at work on a canvas. Once this painting is complete, it will be a unique good, for which there is no exact substitute]]
Cultural economics is concerned with the arts in a broad sense. The goods considered have creative content, but that is not enough to qualify as a cultural good. Designer goods such as clothes and drapes are not considered usually to be works of art or culture. Cultural goods are those with a value determined by symbolic content rather than physical characteristics. (For further considerations, see also [[Cultural Institutions Studies]]). Economic thinking has been applied in ever more areas in the last decennia, including pollution, corruption and education.

Works of art and culture have a specific quality, which is their uniqueness. While other economic goods, such as [[crude oil]] or [[wheat]] are generic, interchangeable commodities (given a specific grade of the product), there is only one example of a famous painting such as the [[Mona Lisa]], and only one example of Rodin's well-known sculpture "[[The Thinker]]". While copies or reproductions can be made of these works of art, and while many inexpensive posters of the Mona Lisa and small factory-made replicas of "The Thinker" are sold, neither full-size copies nor inexpensive reproductions are viewed as substitutes for the real artworks, in the way that a consumer views a pound of Grade A sugar from Cuba as a fully equivalent substitute for a pound of Grade A sugar from United States or Dominican Republic.  As there is no equivalent item or substitute for these famous works of art, classical economist [[Adam Smith]] held it was impossible to value them. [[Alfred Marshall]] noted that the demand for a certain kind of cultural good can depend on its consumption: The more you have listened to a particular kind of music, the more you appreciate. In his economic framework, these goods do not have the usual decreasing [[marginal utility]].

Key academic works in cultural economics include those of [[William Baumol|Baumol]] and [[William G. Bowen|Bowen]] (Performing Arts, The Economic Dilemma, 1966), of [[Gary Becker]] on addictive goods, and of [[Alan Peacock]] (public choice). This summary has been divided into sections on the economic study of the performing arts, on the market of individual pieces of art, the art market in cultural industries, the economics of cultural heritage and the labour market in the art sector.

== Performing arts: Baumol and cultural economics ==
[[File:Lux Video Theatre rehearsal 1951.jpg|thumb|right|200px|This picture shows actors rehearsing for a play in 1951. Despite the numerous technological advances in between 1951 and the 2010s, in the 2010s, it would still require the same number of actors to perform this play. For this reason, scholars argue that some cultural industries are not getting more efficient the way other industries, such as accounting and banking, are; these latter two industries require far fewer workers in the 2010s due to the development of computer programs.]]
The seminal paper by William Baumol and Bowen introduced the term [[Baumol's cost disease|cost disease]] for a relative cost growth of live performances. This cost growth explains the increasing dependency of this kind of art on state subsidies. It occurs when the consumable good is labour itself. To understand this phenomenon, compare the change in the cost of performing the [[Molière]] play "[[Tartuffe]]" in 1664 and in 2007 with the change in cost of calculating a large number of sums from an accounting ledger. In 1664, you needed two hours and twelve actors to perform Molière's play, and it would take, say, twelve accountants working for two hours to add up all the sums in an accounting ledger. In 2007, a single accountant with a $10 calculator can add the sums in 20 minutes, but you still need two hours and twelve actors for the Molière play. Artists must make a considerable investment in [[human capital]] (e.g., training), and needs to be paid accordingly. The artists' pay needs to rise along with that of the population in general. As the latter is following the general productivity in the economy, the cost of a play will rise with general productivity, while the actors' productivity does not rise.

There are two lines of thought in subsequent literature on the economics of the performing arts:

*The first concentrates on the existence of productivity growth in some areas of production, thus contradicting the relevance of cost disease. Staying with the "Tartuffe" example, the same performance can be viewed by an ever-larger audience by improvements in the design of theatres, and by the introduction of microphones, television and recording.
*The second is concerned with the allocation of subsidies to the cultural sector. While these should be in the general public interest, they may have an income distribution effect, e.g. if they reduce cost to the relatively well-off part of society. This is the case when the well-off are overrepresented in the audiences of subsidized plays, or when subsidies go to a small elitist group of artists.

== Market for artworks ==
Two segments of the market in the visual arts can be distinguished: works of art that are familiar and have a history, and contemporary works that are more easily influenced by fashion and new discoveries. Both markets, however, are [[oligopoly|oligopolistic]], i.e., there are limited numbers of sellers and buyers ([[oligopsony]]). Two central questions on the working of the markets are: How are prices determined, and what is the [[rate of return|return]] on artworks, compared to the return on financial assets?

=== Price determination ===
Components of a work of art, like raw stone, tubes of paint or unpainted canvas, in general have a value much lower than the finished products, such as a sculpture or a finished painting. Also, the amount of labour needed to produce an item does not explain the big price differences between works of art. It seems that the value is much more dependent on potential buyers', and experts' perception of it. This perception has three elements: First, social value, which is the social status the buyer has by owning it. The artist thus has an "artistic capital". Second, the artistic value, compared to contemporary works, or as importance to later generations. Third, the price history of the item, if a buyer uses this for his expectation of a future price at which he might sell the item again (given the oligopolistic market structure).
Three kinds of economic agents determine these values. Specific experts like gallery owners or museum directors use the first, social value. Experts like art historians and art professors use the second, artistic value. Buyers who buy works of art as an investment use the third, the price history and expectations for future price increases.

=== Art market and investment ===
[[File:Asrlar Sadosi2012b.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Fine art such as paintings are typically sold at [[auction]]s.]]
Some major financial institutions, banks and insurance companies, have had considerable return rates on investments in art works in the 1990s. These rates have not slowed down at the same time as the rates on [[stock exchange]]s, in the early 90's. This may indicate a [[diversification (finance)|diversification]] opportunity. Apart from this evidence of successful investment, the amount of data available has stimulated study of the market. Many works are sold on [[auction]]s. These transactions are thus very transparent. This has made it possible to establish price databases, with prices of some items going back to 1652. Empirical studies have shown that, on average, the [[rate of return|return]] on works of art has been lower than that on [[stock|equity]], with a [[Volatility (finance)|volatility]] that is at least as high. An [[intangible asset|intangible]] gain in terms of pleasure of having a work of art could explain this partly. However, before interpreting the figures, it should be borne in mind that art is often exempt of many kinds of taxes. In 1986, Baumol made an estimate of an average yearly rate of return of 0.55 percent for works of art, against a rate of return of 2.5 percent for financial assets, over a 20-year period.

== Cultural industries ==
Some famous artworks such as the ''[[Mona Lisa]]'' painting are not reproducible (at least in the sense of creating another copy that would be seen as equivalent in value), but there are many cultural goods whose value does not depend on a single, individual copy. Books, recordings, movies get some of their value from the existence of many copies of the original. These are the products of major cultural industries, which are the book industry, the music industry and the film industry. These markets are characterized by:
* '''Uncertainty of value'''. The demand for a good (market success) is hard to predict. For example, with movies, even if a film's plot, themes and selection of actors has been extensively tested using focus groups and polls, and even if the movie uses popular [[A-list]] actors, this film may still be a [[box office bomb]] (e.g., ''[[Gigli]]'', a 2003 American romantic comedy starring [[Ben Affleck]] and [[Jennifer Lopez]]). On the other hand, a low-budget film by an unknown director and an unknown cast, such as ''[[The Blair Witch Project]]'' can surprise the industry by being a major hit. This uncertainty is a characteristic of an [[experience good]] such as films, TV shows, musical theatre shows and music concerts.
* '''Infinite variety'''. You can differentiate between regular consumer products, e.g. cars, on basis of its characteristics. For example, a hatchback can be purchased from a number of manufacturers with a set list of options (e.g., automatic transmission, standard transmission, convertible, etc.), with the different options requiring different charges. Many general products allow classification on a relatively small number of such characteristics. Cultural goods, however, have a very high number of characteristics, which, on top of that, often are subjective. For example, an early 1990s band with loud, [[distortion (music)|distorted]] [[electric guitar]] could be considered to be [[grunge]], [[punk rock|punk]], [[heavy metal music]] or [[alternative rock]] by different [[music critic]]s.  This makes cultural products hard to compare.
* '''High concentration in the products which are traded or sold'''. A major part of sales of cultural goods is in a very small number of [[bestseller]]s (e.g., with books), [[blockbuster (entertainment)|blockbuster]]s (movies) or hit [[Single (music)|single]]s (pop music).
* '''Short [[product life cycle management|life cycle]]'''. Most cultural items are sold/traded shortly after their introduction or production. Some cultural goods, such as broadcast news, have little or no market value shortly after the broadcast. Of course, some cultural products may retain saleability for years or even decades, as with the small number of films that become [[cult movie]]s (e.g., ''[[Rocky Horror Picture Show]]'') or certain classic novels or albums that have enduring appeal (the "[[back catalogue]]" of a record label).
* '''High [[fixed cost]]s'''. There is high cost before introduction of a new artwork or cultural product. Making a movie can cost millions of dollars; however the marginal cost of making an additional copy of the DVD may cost less than a dollar.

=== Market structure ===
The important cultural industries tend to have an [[oligopolistic]] [[market structure]]. The market is dominated by a few major companies, with the rest of the market consisting of many small companies. The latter may act as a filter or as "gatekeepers" for the artistic supply. A small company with a successful artist or good quality roster can be bought by one of the major companies. Big conglomerates, pooling TV and film production, have existed for decades. The 1990s have seen some mergers extending beyond the industry as such, and mergers of hardware producers with content providers. Anticipated gains from [[synergy]] and [[market power]] have not been realised, and from the early 2000s there has been a trend towards organisation along sector lines.

== Economics of cultural heritage ==
[[Cultural heritage]] is reflected in goods and real estate. Management and [[regulatory economics|regulation]] of museums has come under study in this area.

=== Museums ===
[[File:The Otsuka Museum of Art20s3200.jpg|thumb|right200px|The [[Otsuka Museum of Art]] in Japan.]]
Museums, which have a conservatory role, and provide exhibitions to the general public, can be commercial, or on a non-profit base. In the second case, as they provide a [[public good]], they pose the problems related to these goods: should they be self-financing, or be subsidized ? One of the specific issues is the imbalance between the huge value of the collections in museums, and their budgets. Also, they are often located in places (city centres) where the cost of land is high, which limits their expansion possibilities. American museums exhibit only about half of their collection. Some museums in Europe, like the Pompidou Centre in France, show less than 5 percent of their collection. Apart from providing exhibitions, museums get proceeds from derived products, like catalogues and reproductions. They also produce at a more intangible level: They make collections. Out of so many pieces in the public domain, they make a selection based on their expertise, thus adding value to the mere existence of the items.

The dual goal of conservation and providing exhibitions obviously presents a choice. On the one hand the museum has, for conservation reasons, an interest in exhibiting as few items as possible, and it would select lesser known works and a specialized audience, to promote knowledge and research. On the other hand, the exhibition argument requires showing the major pieces from different cultures, to satisfy the demands from the public and to attract a large audience. When a government has made a choice about this, application of economic [[contract theory]] will help to implement this choice by showing how to use incentives to different managers (on the financial, conservatory side) to obtain the required result.

=== Real estate and buildings  ===
[[File:Wr Neustaedter Dom.jpg|thumb|right|200px|In many countries, historic buildings such as cathedrals are considered to be "heritage buildings" and as such they are protected against demolition or substantial modifications.]]
Many countries have systems that protect historically significant buildings and structures. These are buildings or other structures that are deemed to have cultural importance or which are deemed to have heritage value. Owners get tax deductions or subsidies for restoration, in return for which they accept restrictions on modifications to the buildings or provide public access. Buildings that are often classified as heritage buildings include former or current Parliament buildings, cathedrals, courthouses, houses built in a recognized historical style, and even fairly regular houses, if the house was formerly the home of a famous [[politician]], [[artist]] or inventor. Buildings with heritage status cannot typically be demolished. Depending on the nature of the heritage restrictions, the current owner may or may not be allowed to modify the outside or inside of the building. Such a system poses the same choice problems as museums do. There has been little study of this issue.

== Artists' labour market ==
The [[labour market]] for artists is characterized by:
* There is an '''extremely unequal [[income distribution]]''' within the market segment. A very small group of artists earn a high proportion of the total income, while the average income is low.
* There is a '''structural excess supply of labour'''. There are always more people who would like to earn their income as an artist than there is demand for artists and artworks. For example, there are far more young [[indie rock]] bands aspiring to careers in music than there are available paid contracts in the recording industry. Due to this excess supply of labour, a [[nightclub]] owner has so many local young bands requesting to play at her venue that she can offer them little or no payment for their performance.
* There are '''intangible returns to labour''', also called "nonpecuniary benefits" (this means non-financial, non-wage benefits). For example, a musician is able to spend her days creating beautiful music and working with other creative people, which is very satisfying. Due to these intangible returns, artists are often willing to accept lower wages than their qualifications would earn in a different market. For example, working with a famous musician may provide such great intangible benefits (e.g., it is exciting to meet and work with such a well-known performer) that a [[record producer]] may be able to ask musicians to record with the start musician for little or no payment.
* '''Non-separation of artist and work'''. While some workers in the cultural industries do not make a strong connection between their work tasks and their self-identity, for some types of artists, such as painters, sculptors and filmmakers, the image their artwork or creative output gives them is important to artists' sense of self. Whether this phenomenon occurs depends on a number of factors, such as the type of artistic job and individuals' perceptions. In the 2010s, many famous [[film director]]s view the movies they direct as directly identified with their artistic vision. However, an assistant director leading scenes in [[action film]]s may see him or herself as a worker in a cultural industry, and he/she may not feel artistically identified with the film's he/she works on.

=== Star system ===
[[File:Evan Rachel Wood (April 2009) 4.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Sherwin Rosen]] states that top stars have such high earnings because their movies sell more copies.]]
The term [[superstar (celebrity)|"star system"]], coined by [[Sherwin Rosen]], is used to explain why a very small number of the artists and creators in the market, such as the celebrity [[A-list]] actors and top [[pop singer]]s, earn most of the total earnings in a sector. Rosen's 1981 paper examined the economics of superstars to determine why “relatively small numbers of people earn enormous amounts of money and seem to dominate the fields in which they engage.” Rosen argues that in superstar markets, "small differences in talent at the top of the distribution will translate into large differences in revenue." Rosen points out that "...sellers of higher talent charge only slightly higher prices than those of lower talent, but sell much larger quantities; their greater earnings come overwhelmingly from selling larger quantities than from charging higher prices".

In cultural industries, the uncertainty about the quality of a product plays a key role in this. The consumer does not really know how good the product is, until he or she has consumed it (think of a movie), and the producer is confronted with the typical uncertainty in a cultural industry. The consumer looks for guidance in the price, reputation, or a famous name on the cover or poster. As the producer understands this using a famous director, actor or singer affects demand, he or she is prepared to pay a lot for a name considered a sign of quality (a star). Indeed, authors like Adler and Ginsburgh have given evidence that star status is determined by chance: in a musical contest, results were highly correlated with the order of performance. This randomness has been used to explain why the labor supply in the sector remains excessive: given the extreme gains of a star, and an irrational behaviour, or particular preferences, with respect to chance, unsuccessful artists keep trying, even when they are earning their money mostly in a different trade, such as waiting tables. A second argument is the possibility of intangible returns to artists' labour in terms of social status and lifestyle. For example, even a struggling [[DJ]] spends most of her time onstage on [[nightclub]]s and [[rave]]s, which for some people is a desirable outcome.

=== Production structure ===
[[File:Set design by Philippe Chaperon for Act4 sc2 of Aida by Verdi 1880 Paris.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A painter who does canvases that hang in major museums and a professional set painter for opera or theatre are both skilled painters who do painting for a living. However, the former is more likely to view her/his paintings as part of her artistic expression and identity, whereas the latter is more likely to view her/himself as a craftsperson.]]

A case has been made for the existence of a different structure in the production of cultural goods . (See [[Cultural Institutions Studies]].) An artist often considers a product to be an expression of himself, while the ordinary craftsperson is only concerned with his product, as far as it affects his/her pay or salary. For example, a painter who creates artworks that are displayed in museums may view her paintings as her artistic expression. On the other hand, a scene painter for a music theatre company may see herself as a craftsperson who is paid by the hour for doing painting. The artist may thus want restrict the use of his or her product, and he/she may object if a museum uses a reproduction of his/her painting to help sell cars or liquor. On the other hand, the scene painter may not object to commercial re-uses of her set painting, as she/he may see it just as a regular job.

The theatre had a seating capacity of 1,050, and staged a variety of performances, including appearances by the [[tango (music)|tango]] artists [[Carlos Gardel]], [[Francisco Canaro]], [[Roberto Firpo]] and [[Ignacio Corsini]]. Glücksmann started his own [[Radio in Argentina|radio]] station in 1924 (''Radio Splendid''), which broadcast from the building where his recording company, ''Nacional Odeón'', made some of the early recordings of the great tango singers of the day. In the late twenties the theatre was converted into a cinema, and in 1929 showed the first [[sound film]]s presented in Argentina.

The ornate former theatre was leased by Grupo Ilhsa in February 2000.&lt;ref name="GrupoIlhsaManzone"&gt;{{cite news |title=El Ateneo Grand Splendid, una joya entre las librerías del mundo |first=Raquel |last=San Martín |url=http://www.lanacion.com.ar/979452-el-ateneo-grand-splendid-una-joya-entre-las-librerias-del-mundo |newspaper=La Nación |location=Buenos Aires |date=17 January 2008 |accessdate=10 May 2015 |language=Spanish |trans-title=El Ateneo Grand Splendid, a jewel among the libraries of the world |quote=En febrero de 2000, el Grupo Ilhsa firmó un contrato de alquiler por 10 años sobre el edificio e invirtió 3 millones de pesos en remodelaciones, a cargo del estudio del arquitecto Fernando Manzone.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ilhsa, through Tematika, owns El Ateneo and Yenny booksellers (totaling over 40 stores), as well as the El Ateneo publishing house. The building was subsequently renovated and converted into a book and music shop under the direction of architect Fernando Manzone;&lt;ref name="GrupoIlhsaManzone"/&gt; the cinema seating was removed and in its place book shelves were installed. Following refurbishment works, the {{convert|2000|sqm|sqft|abbr=on}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=El Ateneo Grand Splendid, una joya entre las librerías del mundo |first=Raquel |last=San Martín |url=http://www.lanacion.com.ar/979452-el-ateneo-grand-splendid-una-joya-entre-las-librerias-del-mundo |newspaper=La Nación |location=Buenos Aires |date=17 January 2008 |accessdate=10 May 2015 |language=Spanish |trans-title=El Ateneo Grand Splendid, a jewel among the libraries of the world |quote=En tres plantas alfombradas, que conservan el rojo y dorado original, la librería tiene 2000 metros cuadrados totales.}}&lt;/ref&gt; El Ateneo Grand Splendid became the group's flagship store, and in 2007 sold over 700,000 books; over a million people walk through its doors annually.

Chairs are provided throughout the building, including the still-intact theatre boxes, where customers can dip into books before purchase, and there is now a café on the back of what was once the stage.  The ceiling, the ornate carvings, the crimson stage curtains, the auditorium lighting and many architectural details remain. Despite the changes, the building still retains the feeling of the grand theatre it once was.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Top shelves |first=Sean |last=Dodson |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/jan/11/bestukbookshops |work=The Guardian |location=London |date=11 January 2008 |accessdate=10 May 2015 |quote=As you can see from this photomontage the El Ateneo has retained its former splendour, with high painted ceiling, original balconies and ornate carvings intact.}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Guardian]]'', a prominent British periodical, named El Ateneo Grand Splendid second in its 2008 list of the world's ten best bookshops.&lt;ref name="TheGuardian"/&gt;

'''''Fallen Astronaut''''' is an {{convert|8.5|cm|in|sp=us|adj=on}} [[aluminium]] [[sculpture]] created by '''Paul Van Hoeydonck'''. It is a small stylized figure, meant to depict an [[astronaut]] in a [[spacesuit]], intended to commemorate the astronauts and [[cosmonaut]]s who have died in the advancement of space exploration. It was commissioned and placed on the [[Moon]] by the crew of [[Apollo 15]] at [[Mons Hadley|Hadley Rille]] on August 1, 1971, next to a plaque listing the fourteen men known at the time to have died.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Sculpture, Fallen Astronaut| url=http://airandspace.si.edu/collections/artifact.cfm?object=nasm_A19860035000| website=Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum| accessdate=17 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The crew kept the memorial's existence a secret until after completion of their mission. After public disclosure, the [[National Air and Space Museum]] requested and received a replica of the statue. Controversy soon followed, as Van Hoeydonck claimed a different understanding of the agreement made with the astronauts and attempted to sell up to 950 copies of the statue. He finally relented under pressure from [[NASA]], which has a strict policy against commercial exploitation of the US government space program.

==Commission==
[[Image:Willy Bosschem255.jpg|thumb|upright=0.5|''Portrait of Van Hoeydonck'' by [[:nl:Willy Bosschem|Willy Bosschem]]]]
Prior to his [[Apollo 15]] lunar mission, astronaut [[David Scott]] met [[Belgian]] painter and printmaker Paul Van Hoeydonck at a dinner party. It was there agreed that Van Hoeydonck would create a small statuette for Scott to place on the Moon, though their recollections of the details disagree.  Scott's purpose was to commemorate those astronauts and cosmonauts who had lost their lives in the furtherance of space exploration, and he designed and separately made a plaque listing fourteen American and Soviet names. Van Hoeydonck was given a set of design specifications: the sculpture was to be lightweight but sturdy, capable of withstanding the temperature extremes of the Moon; it could not be identifiably male or female, nor of any identifiable ethnic group. According to Scott, it was agreed Van Hoeydonck's name would not be made public, to avoid the commercial exploitation of the US government's space program.&lt;ref name="Slate"&gt;{{harvnb|Powell|Shapiro|2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Scott kept the agreement secret from NASA management prior to the mission, smuggling the statue aboard his spacecraft.

Van Hoeydonck gives a different account of the agreement: according to an interview in Belgian newspaper ''[[Le Soir]]'', the statue was supposed to be a representation of all mankind, not only fallen astronauts or cosmonauts.  He claimed he did not know the statue would be used as a memorial for the fallen space-goers, and the name given to the work was neither chosen nor approved by him; he had intended the figure to be left standing upright.  He also denies it was agreed he would remain anonymous.&lt;ref name="Slate" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Le Soir|17 July 2009|p=19}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Both his and Scott's versions of events are given in an article in [[Slate (magazine)|''Slate'' magazine]] in 2013.&lt;ref name="Slate" /&gt;

==Placement on the Moon==
During the [[Apollo 15]] mission, near the completion of his work on the lunar surface on August 1, 1971, Scott secretly placed the ''Fallen Astronaut'' on the Moon, along with a plaque bearing the names of eight American astronauts and six Soviet cosmonauts who had died in service:

Scott photographed the memorial, but waited for a post-mission press conference to publicly disclose its existence. Later, he noted that "Sadly, two names are missing (from the plaque), those of [[Valentin Bondarenko]] and [[Grigori Nelyubov]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Leonov|Scott|2013|p=313}}&lt;/ref&gt; He explained that the western world was unaware of their deaths, because of the secrecy surrounding the Soviet space program at the time. Also missing was the name of [[Robert Henry Lawrence Jr.]], the first black astronaut and a U.S. Air Force officer selected for the [[Manned Orbiting Laboratory]] program who was killed in a training accident in 1967.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/7018497/#.Vp9XNk_YxIU |title=The Unsung Astronaut |last=Oberg |first=James |work=[[NBC News]] |date=2005-02-23 |accessdate=2016-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
[[File:Brief Jan Stalmans - Paul Van Hoeydonck 11-09-2007.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Query from Jan Stalmans to  Van Hoeydonck about the number of outstanding replicas, with handwritten reply]]

After the crew disclosed the statuette's existence during their press conference, the [[National Air and Space Museum]] requested that a replica be made for public display. The crew agreed, on condition that it be displayed "with good taste and without publicity".  The replica was given to the [[Smithsonian Institution]] on April 17, 1972, the day after CBS anchorman [[Walter Cronkite]] referred to the ''Fallen Astronaut'' and plaque as the first art installation on the Moon during the broadcast of the Apollo 16 launch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://airandspace.si.edu/collections/artifact.cfm?id=A19860035000| title=Sculpture, Fallen Astronaut| work=si.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is now on display with a replica of the plaque&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://airandspace.si.edu/collections/artifact.cfm?id=A19772403001|title=Plaque, Fallen Astronaut and Cosmonaut, Reproduction|work=si.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the Museum's [[National Mall]] Building in the Space Race Wing, Gallery 114.

In May 1972, Scott learned that Van Hoeydonck planned to make and sell more replicas. Believing that this would be a violation of the spirit of their agreement, and NASA's policy against commercial exploitation of the space program, Scott tried to persuade Van Hoeydonck to refrain. It was advertised in a full-page advertisement in the July 1972 issue of ''Art in America'' magazine,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After complaints from NASA about the intended sale, Van Hoeydonck retracted his permission for it and no statues were sold.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Van den Bussche|1980|pp=16–17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 11, 2007, art journalist Jan Stalmans wrote to Van Hoeydonck, asking him how many replicas were in existence. Van Hoeydonk returned a handwritten response on the letter, that 50 copies had been made, most of which were still in his possession, unsigned. Van Hoeydonck wrote that he had only ever received money for one copy of ''Fallen Astronaut'', despite many purchase offers he had received (see the English translation [[:File:Brief Jan Stalmans - Paul Van Hoeydonck 11-09-2007.jpg|of the letter]]).{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}

[[File:Panorama of 4 Season bathroom.jpg|thumb|Panorama of Four Seasons Bathroom]]

The '''Four-Season Bathhouse''' (حمام چهارفصل) in the Iranian city [[Arak, Iran|Arak]] dates back to the [[Qajar]] period, and had two separate sections for ladies and gents. The tile-work of the clock room and spinal designed columns of this area, including the layout of the bath are interesting features. The structure was renovated into a museum after undergoing necessary repairs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.irib.ir/galleries/item/184727-chahar-fasl-four-season-bath-house-in-arak,-iran|title=Chahar Fasl (Four - Season) Bath house in Arak, Iran|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Four Seasons Bathhouse in Arak is the largest [[bathhouse]] in Iran. This bathhouse was built in the late Qajar (Ahmad Shah) by Haji Muhammad Ibrahim khansari. A variety of decorated tiles in the building display designs of humans, animals, and plants. Drawings and paintings of the four seasons of the year in the four corners of the bathroom is the reason for its name. The bathroom is the only bathroom where, a separate part is devoted to religious minorities. Four Seasons Bathroom is recorded in the National Heritage List.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.rasekhoon.net/article/show/1010875/10-historic-bathrooms-of-iran/|title=10 historic bathrooms of Iran|work=راسخون}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{nihongo|'''''Genshiken'''''|げんしけん|lead=yes}} is a [[manga]] series by [[Shimoku Kio]] about a college club for ''[[otaku]]'' (extremely obsessed fans of various media) and the lifestyle its members pursue. The title is a shortening of the club's official name, {{nihongo|'''''Gen'''dai '''Shi'''kaku Bunka '''Ken'''kyūkai''|現代視覚文化研究会}}, or "The Society for the Study of Modern Visual Culture". The series has also been adapted into an [[anime]] directed by Tsutomu Mizushima. The manga originally ran in [[Kodansha]]'s monthly [[manga]] anthology ''[[Afternoon (magazine)|Afternoon]]'' from April 2002 to May 2006, and has been reprinted in nine [[tankōbon|bound volumes]]. The ninth and final volume was released in Japan in December 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date = August 29, 2006|url = http://heiseidemocracy.com/2006/08/30/genshiken-the-saga-continues/|title = Genshiken: The Saga Continues|publisher = Heisei Democracy|accessdate = 2006-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A two-part short bonus story was included across both volumes of the ''[[Kujibiki Unbalance (2006 series)|Kujibiki Unbalance]]'' manga, published 2006/7.

In December 2009, a new chapter was released in ''Afternoon'' to celebrate the release of the Japanese ''Genshiken 2'' DVD box-set, and in October 2010, the series resumed serialization as {{nihongo|''Genshiken: Second Season''|げんしけん二代目|Genshiken Nidaime}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Genshiken Manga to Return as Genshiken II in Japan|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2010-09-21/genshiken-manga-returns-as-genshiken-ii|work=Anime News Network|accessdate=22 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==

===Themes===
&lt;!---Do NOT turn this into a LIST of cultural references. Only mention those that are really important.---&gt;
The series, being focused on the ''[[otaku]]'' lifestyle, contains numerous references to other [[manga]], [[anime]], video games, and other aspects of ''otaku'' culture. Common plot points include such ''otaku''-centric activities as the buying and creation of ''[[dōjinshi]]'', fan-made manga usually of erotic content; convincing a character to try [[cosplay]] (the dressing up as characters from manga, anime, or video games); the creation of [[model robot|plamo]] (plastic models that must be assembled); visiting [[Akihabara]], Tokyo's electronics shopping district; or attending the biannual Comic Festival ("Comifes"), a reference to [[Comic Market]] ("Comiket"), Japan's single largest anime- and manga-focused fan convention.

Because the anime is co-produced by [[Sega Sammy Holdings]], the ''[[Guilty Gear (series)|Guilty Gear]]'' video game series is heavily referenced, with actual gameplay sequences being shown multiple times, Ohno cosplaying as [[Kuradoberi Jam]], and other minor references. The [[Sega]] puzzle game ''[[Puyo Puyo]]''{{ref label|name|a|}} also serves as an important plot point as Kasukabe tries to gain Kousaka's attention. Numerous other non-Sega/Sammy properties are also referenced throughout the anime, but their names are changed slightly, such as ''[[The King of Fighters '95]]'' being alluded to as ''COF 95'' and ''[[Capcom vs SNK 2]]'' as "S-Cup". Discussion of ''[[eroge]]'', erotic video games usually of the [[visual novel]] genre, also occurs often.

Similar to the treatment of video games in the series, popular anime and manga are often alluded to by pseudonyms, such as "''Gungal''" (''[[Mobile Suit Gundam|Gundam]]''), "''Reass Mood''" (''[[Code Geass]]''), "''Haregan''" (''[[Fullmetal Alchemist|Hagane no Renkinjutsushi/Fullmetal Alchemist]]''), "''Scram Dunk''" (''[[Slam Dunk (manga)|Slam Dunk]]''), "''Neko Yasha''" (''[[InuYasha]]''), and many others. ''Genshiken'' usually avoids referring to these series so in-depth that it would require the use of names and lines from their real-world counterparts, with several notable exceptions: in the model-building chapter of the manga (but not the anime), actual ''Gundam'' mecha and characters are referred to throughout, while the dialogue quoted by Sue (except for one "Neko Yasha!" outburst) is pulled directly from ''[[Neon Genesis Evangelion (TV)|Evangelion]]'', ''[[Lupin III]]'', ''[[Azumanga Daioh]]'', and other series.

These cultural references have remained intact for the English adaption of the manga, which include a section for translation notes. However, due to the number of allusions made and the inability for a translator to always know what is being referred to, many explanations of ''otaku'' references are still absent. The anime however, has been criticized for having "excessive script variances" with its English dub translations, such as injecting English specific references like "[[Talk to the hand (expression)|talk to the hand]]" and for inconsistently including liner notes.&lt;ref&gt;

'''Ramen Angel Pretty Menma'''
[[File:Chika and Kanako cosplaying Pretty Menma.jpg|thumb|Ogiue and Ohno cosplaying Pretty Menma and Cutie Tonko, main heroines of "Ramen Angel Pretty Menma".]]
Another fictitious series created for the series is ''[[Ramen]] Angel Pretty Menma'', a generic [[eroge|adult visual novel]]. Mentioned in passing as Sasahara's first such game in the manga, it is given much greater emphasis in the second TV series. The plot revolves around Kaoru Torigara, only son of a ramen shop owner, who is going to renovate his inherited ramen shop. He discovers that his shop has a guardian angel named Pretty [[Menma]]. Pretty Menma tells Kaoru that his dead father's intention is making him succeed in the "Food King Wars", a battle of restaurants around the world that is held every 4 years. Kaoru and Menma must help each other to go through the struggles of the "Food King Wars".&lt;ref&gt;

|accessdate = 2007-12-21}} 
&lt;/ref&gt; In the anime, there is also ''Ramen Angel Pretty Menma 2'', which continues from the first version. Additionally, the third version of the opening sequence (that uses the same song, but adds scenes and edits existing ones) shows Ogiue cosplaying Pretty Menma, Ohno cosplaying Cutie Tonko (another heroine in this series who represents ''tonkotsu'', a form of ramen broth), and Kasukabe cosplaying Menma's mother.&lt;ref&gt;

===Plot===
{{See also|List of Genshiken chapters}}
''Genshiken'' follows the lives of a group of college students drawn together by their shared hobbies, and the trials and adventures associated with being [[otaku]]. The story begins with the introduction of Kanji Sasahara, a shy, confidence-lacking freshman who on club day at university, decides to join a club he would actually enjoy, Genshiken. Over his four years at [[Chuo University|Shiiou University]], Sasahara comes to accept himself for who he is and loses the inhibitions and guilt he once felt and associated with otaku culture, becoming an enthusiastic clubmember, and for a time, a capable club president. As the story of ''Genshiken'' progresses, focus is also placed on Saki Kasukabe, a determined non-otaku who initially struggles to drag her boyfriend Kousaka out of the club, and Chika Ogiue, a self-professed otaku-hater who feels a deep-seated shame and self-loathing toward her own interests and hobbies.

During the course of the series, the reader bears witness as the group grows in its cohesiveness over time, and bonds form between the characters as they begin to see themselves as more than fellow club members, but friends as well. In this context, club activities such as group outings, the biannual pilgrimage to [[Comiket|Comifes]], and even simply hanging out in the clubroom, allow the characters' complex relationships to grow into friendship, infatuation, and at times, even love. While a few of them never quite see eye-to-eye about their interests or the lives they lead, they are held together by the bonds of friendship that they share.

====Second Season====
After Sasahara, Kousaka and Kasukabe graduate, the series shifts focus to three new club members: The self-conscious Yajima, the energetic-yet-annoying Yoshitake, and Hato, a male fujoshi who cross-dresses fit in better and go unrecognized from his normal classmates. Emphasis is also put on the character of Madarame, a former president of the club who actually graduated a year before Sasahara, but remained in the club due to working and having an apartment nearby and hanging out in the clubroom in his time off and struggles to grow up and move on from university.

{{see also|List of Genshiken episodes}}
The manga was brought to television by the production company [[Genco]] through animation studio [[Palm Studio|Palm]] in 2004 as a twelve-episode [[anime]] and in 2006 and 2007 as a three-episode [[OVA]], adapting the first five volumes of the manga. The TV series was licensed for North American release by [[Media Blasters]].

The anime adaptation is very faithful to the original work, with few revisions being made, with the exception that many references to specific anime, manga, and video games are changed or removed. The previously fictional ''Kujibiki Unbalance'' manga series was also turned into an anime series to match the medium, with three complete episodes being created for sampling in the anime version of ''Genshiken''. The three ''Kujibiki Unbalance'' episodes are provided as bonus [[OVA]]s with the purchase of the ''Genshiken'' DVDs.

It was originally announced by [[Media Factory]] at [[Comiket]] 69 that the second TV series of ''Genshiken'' would premiere in October 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date = January 10, 2006|url = http://heiseidemocracy.com/2006/01/10/genshiken-anime-season-2-announced/|title = NEWS FLASH: Genshiken Anime Season 2 Announced|publisher = Heisei Democracy|accessdate = 2006-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Media Factory clarified their statement in May 2006, saying that the series airing in the fall would be a full-fledged ''Kujibiki Unbalance'' series, rather than a ''Genshiken'' sequel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date = May 24, 2006|url = http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/article.php?id=8923|title = New Kujian Anime|publisher = [[Anime News Network]]|accessdate = 2006-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the DVD releases of the new ''Kujibiki Unbalance'' series each included an OVA episode of ''Genshiken'', for a total of three new episodes. The first new episode was released with ''Kujibiki Unbalance'' DVD Box 1 on December 22, 2006, with the two subsequent installments following on February 23 and April 25, 2007, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date = October 2006|url = http://www.genshiken.info/goods_dvd.html|title = ("Goods" page on the official ''Genshiken'' website)|publisher = |accessdate = 2006-10-12|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061105012412/http://www.genshiken.info/goods_dvd.html|archivedate = 2006-11-05|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 23, 2007, it was announced on the ''Genshiken'' homepage that a second anime television series would be produced, including the character Ogiue, who had been introduced in the OVA episodes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date = 23 April 2007|url = http://www.genshiken.info|title = ｢げんしけん｣アニメ第2期シリーズ制作決定!|publisher = |accessdate = 2007-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first episode of the second series aired on October 11, 2007 on Japanese TV. A radio webcast ran simultaneously with the terrestrial broadcast. The final episode of the series aired on December 27, 2007; however, it did not conclude the story.

The TV version of ''Genshiken 2'' aired with minor censorship. Oddly though, the censorship was that of a highly erotic [[kiss]] that involved no nudity. Additional nudity like breast nipples and strong cleavage was also censored. The DVD version shows everything uncensored.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date = January 5, 2008|url =http://heiseidemocracy.com/2008/01/25/mainichi-junk-january-25th-2008/|title=Genshiken uncensored|publisher=Heisei Democracy|accessdate=2008-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the March issue of ''[[Monthly Afternoon]]'' it was announced that a new anime had been authorized for ''Genshiken: Second Season''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Genshiken: Second Season Sequel Manga Gets Anime |url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2013-01-23/genshiken/second-season-sequel-manga-gets-anime |newspaper=Anime News Network |date=23 January 2013 |accessdate=29 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new anime sequel is directed by Tsutomu Mizushima at [[Production I.G]], with [[Michiko Yokote]] serving as the series composition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tsutomu Mizushima Directs New Genshiken Anime at I.G |url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2013-04-23/tsutomu-mizushima-directs-new-genshiken-anime-at-i.g|publisher=Anime News Network|accessdate=23 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The series premiered in July 7, 2013 and includes the opening song "Genshi, Joshi wa, Taiyo Datta" by [[Sumire Uesaka]] and the band Kabuki Rocks. At [[Anime Expo]] 2013, [[Nippon Ichi Software|NIS America]] announced their acquisition of ''Genshiken: Second Season'' for North American release.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NISA Adds Hanasaku Iroha Film, Genshiken 2nd Season Anime|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2013-07-04/nisa-adds-hanasaku-iroha-film-genshiken-2nd-season-anime|publisher=Anime News Network|accessdate=4 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A ''Genshiken: Second Season'' OAD (Original Animation DVD) was bundled with the limited edition of the 15th volume of the ''Genshiken'' manga, released in Dec 20, 2013. The story is set between the events of the ''Genshiken 2'' and ''Genshiken: Second Season'' series.

===Drama CD===
There has been three drama CD bundled together with different media in the series. The first one was released as a "first press" item for the 9th volume of the manga, while the two others were included in the two first volumes of the "Genshiken 2" DVDs.

'''List of releases:'''

* 1. Genshiken Dai 9 kan: Tokusōban Drama CD 
* 2. Dai 8.5 wa 'Otaku Shigan... Mitai na?'
* 3. Bangai hen 'Road to Ikebukuro (kari)'

===Light novel===
In 2008, Kodansha released the light novel "Shoron Genshiken: Hairu Ranto no Yabou",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100302153640/http://www.genshiken.info/goods_book.html | archivedate=2010-03-02 | deadurl=yes | url=http://www.genshiken.info/goods_book.html | title=TVアニメ げんしけん公式サイト - Goods/Book }}&lt;/ref&gt; with Del Rey releasing the book in June 2010. The book introduces the character of Ranto Hairu, the rich grandson of one of Japan's most influential businessmen, as he takes over the student club organization with the intention of getting rid of any elements he views as unsavory. Meanwhile, a supernatural force is slowly abducting members of Genshiken without a trace.

Chronologically the book falls just after certain events in the second volume, although it should be noted that few of the book's events follow the story elements already established in the series. Changes such as Kuchiki remaining with the Genshiken after his initial attempts to join, the established president of the student club organization drops out due to pregnancy, as well as Ohno and Tanaka's relationship being more established than it was during this point in time. The light novel also introduces several characters that are only present in the novel itself and do not appear in the anime or manga. Also of note is that there are several elements present in the book (such as the supernatural) that are not present in the anime or manga.

==Reception==

'''''Goldfish Memory''''' is a 2003 feature film about everyday relationships, set and filmed in Dublin. It was written and directed by [[Elizabeth Gill]].

==Plot==
The movie is set around a small group of characters experiencing relationships which build and crumble before the viewers' eyes. The title of the film refers to the belief, expressed by several of characters, that the goldfish retains a memory of something for only three seconds. Tom, one of the principal characters in the film, draws comparisons between this and the human tendency to jump from one relationship to the next, "forgetting" the pain that any previous one might have caused. The film shows complexities involved in straight, gay, lesbian, and bisexual relationships. Writer/director Liz Gill says the film was influenced by the work of directors [[Robert Altman]] and [[Richard Linklater]], particularly Linklater's film ''[[Slacker (film)|Slacker]]''.

==Cast==
Sean Campion, [[Fiona O'Shaughnessy]], [[Fiona Glascott]], Peter Gaynor, [[Keith McErlean]], Stuart Graham, Lise Hearns, [[Jean Butler]], Justine Mitchell, Aisling O'Neill, Demien McAdam, Tony Brown, [[Flora Montgomery]].

==Soundtrack==
The film's soundtrack acted as something of a showcase for the Irish alternative music scene of the time. Alongside relatively established bands like [[The Frames]] and [[The Walls]], it also featured up and coming acts like [[Rodrigo y Gabriela]], [[Nina Hynes]] and [[Messiah J and the Expert]].

Four songs by the legendary Brazilian Bossa Nova composer [[Antônio Carlos Jobim|Tom Jobim]] were remade for the movie, three of which ('[[Once I Loved]]', '[[Waters of March]]' and '[[Desafinado]]') were performed by [[Damien Rice]] with [[Lisa Hannigan]] (vocals) and [[Vyvienne Long]] (cello). The other ('Lamento No Morro') was performed by Richie Buckley.

==Critical reaction==
[[Peter Bradshaw]], writing in ''[[The Guardian]]'', described ''Goldfish Memory'' as a "forgettable" and "vapid relationship comedy, reminiscent of the sponsorship ads that wrap around the commercials during TV's ''[[Friends]]''".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Peter|last=Bradshaw|authorlink=Peter Bradshaw|url=http://arts.guardian.co.uk/fridayreview/story/0,,1321817,00.html|title=Goldfish Memory|work=The Guardian|date=8 October 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hard-edge painting'''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/learn/online-resources/glossary/h/hard-edge-painting Tate Glossary, Hard-edge painting] retrieved August 8, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; is painting in which abrupt transitions are found between color areas. Color areas are often of one unvarying color.  The Hard-edge painting style is related to [[Geometric abstraction]], [[Op Art]], [[Post-painterly Abstraction]], and [[Color Field painting]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sbmuseart.org/exhibitions/colorscope.web] retrieved June 2, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of the term==
The term was coined by writer, curator and ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' art critic [[Jules Langsner]], along with [[Peter Selz]], in 1959,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oac.cdlib.org/findaid/ark:/13030/kt5v19r00h/ It was in 1959 that Langsner and art historian Peter Selz originated the phrase "hard-edge painting"] to describe the colors, shapes and style of abstract expressionist painting on the West Coast and in particular the works by [[John McLaughlin (artist)|John McLaughlin]]&lt;/ref&gt; to describe the work of painters from [[California]], who, in their reaction to the more painterly or gestural forms of [[Abstract expressionism]], adopted a knowingly impersonal paint application and delineated areas of color with particular sharpness and clarity. This approach to abstract painting became widespread in the 1960s, though California was its creative center. 

Other, earlier, movements, or styles have also contained the quality of hard-edgedness, for instance the [[Precisionism|Precisionists]] also displayed this quality to a great degree in their work. Hard-edge can be seen to be associated with one or more school of painting, but is also a generally descriptive term, for these qualities found in any painting. Hard-edged painting can be both figurative or nonrepresentational.

In the late 1950s, Langsner and Peter Selz, then professor at the [[Claremont Colleges]], observed a common link among the recent work of [[John McLaughlin (artist)|John McLaughlin]] (1898–1976), [[Lorser Feitelson]] (1898-1978), [[Karl Benjamin]] (1925-2012), [[Frederick Hammersley]] (1919–2009) and Feitelson's wife [[Helen Lundeberg]] (1908-1999). The group of seven gathered at the Feitelson's home to discuss a group exhibition of this nonfigurative painting style. Curated by Langsner, ''Four Abstract Classicists'' opened at the [[Los Angeles County Museum of Art]] in 1959. [[Helen Lundeberg]] was not included in the exhibit.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/07/arts/design/07fink.html?_r=2&amp;oref=slogin&amp;oref=slogin ''Karl Benjamin’s Colorful Resurgence,'' accessed October 21, 2007]&lt;/ref&gt; These painters were featured in a touring exhibition during 2008 called "The Birth of the Cool" in [[California]] museums along with midcentury [[design]], [[music]] and [[film]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.museumca.org/exhibit/exhi_cool.html "Birth of the Cool: California Art, Design, and Culture at Midcentury"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080704055441/http://museumca.org/exhibit/exhi_cool.html |date=2008-07-04 }}, accessed July 21, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

===Exhibition===
[[Image:Karl_Benjamin,_"Orange,_Red,_Umber",_1958,_52_x_36_inches.jpg|thumb|[[Karl Benjamin]], "Orange, Red, Umber" 1958, 52 x 36 inches]]
''Four Abstract Classicists'' was subtitled ''California Hard-edge'' by British art critic and curator [[Lawrence Alloway]] when it traveled to England and Ireland. The term came into broader use after Alloway used it to describe contemporary American geometric abstract painting featuring "economy of form," "fullness of color," "neatness of surface," and the nonrelational arrangement of forms on the canvas.

In 1964, a second major hard-edge exhibition curated by Jules Langsner was held at the Pavilion Gallery in Balboa, CA (also known as the Newport Pavilion) with the cooperation of the Ankrum Gallery, Esther Robles Gallery, Felix Landau Gallery, [[Ferus Gallery]] and Heritage Gallery of [[Los Angeles]].  This was called, simply, ''California Hard-edge painting.'' Included in this show were Florence Arnold, [[John Barbour (artist)|John Barbour]], [[Larry Bell (artist)|Larry Bell]], Karl Benjamin, [[John Coplans]], Lorser Feitelson, Frederick Hammersley, June Harwood, [[Helen Lundeberg]], [[John McLaughlin (artist)|John McLaughlin]], and Dorothy Waldman.

In 2000, Tobey C. Moss curated ''Four Abstract Classicists Plus One'' at her gallery in [[Los Angeles]]. The exhibit again featured John McLaughlin, Feitelson, Hammersley, and Benjamin, and added Lundeberg as the fifth of the original Hard-edge painters.  In 2003, [[Louis Stern Fine Arts]] showed a retrospective exhibition for Lorser Feitelson entitled ''Lorser Feitelson and the invention of Hard-edge painting, 1945-1965.''  The same year, NOHO MODERN showed the works of June Harwood in an exhibition entitled ''June Harwood: Hard-edge painting Revisited, 1959-1969.''  Art critic [[Dave Hickey]] solidified the place of these 6 artists in: ''The Los Angeles School: Karl Benjamin, Lorser Feitelson, Frederick Hammersley, June Harwood, Helen Lundeberg, and John McLaughlin.''  The exhibition was held at the Ben Maltz Gallery of the [[Otis Art Institute]] in [[Los Angeles]] in 2004-2005.

==The style==
This style of hard-edge geometric abstraction recalls the earlier work of [[Kasimir Malevich]], [[Wassily Kandinsky]], [[Theo van Doesburg]], and [[Piet Mondrian]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4612">The '''Kaufmann Crucifixion''' is a [[Bohemia]]n Gothic panel painting by an unknown artist that dates from 1340-1360. It was most probably the central part of a relatively small folding altarpiece. 
[[File:14th-century unknown painters - Crucifixion - WGA23514.jpg|thumb|Kaufmann Crucifixion, [[Gemäldegalerie Berlin]]]]

== History of the painting ==
The picture was probably painted in [[Prague]]. It was acquired from the Berlin collection of Richard von Kaufmann (1849-1908) by the Berlin art dealers Pavel Cassirer and F.W. Lippmann along with Hugo Helbing from Munich, who donated it to the then Kaiser Friedrich Museum in Berlin. From there, the picture found its way to the [[Gemäldegalerie Berlin]].

== Description and context ==
The tempera painting on a wooden panel covered with stretched canvas is 67 x 29.5&amp;nbsp;cm in size. It was restored in 1918 and fixed to a fresh canvas base.
In the [[Bohemia]]n context, it is the first known depiction of [[Calvary]] with three crosses and a complexity of events beneath them, which both point to an Italian influence.&lt;ref&gt;Royt J., 2003, p. 63&lt;/ref&gt; The composition of space and the use of perspectival shortening are also Italian in origin. At the same time, other elements of the painting such as the wealth of rhythm in the figures’ movement, the sharp drawing, the plastic modelling and the Gothic vividness of colour also point to Lower Austrian and western European (French) models.&lt;ref&gt;J. Pešina, 1976, p. 28&lt;/ref&gt; The dramatically focused naturalism is something of an exception to the otherwise lyrical atmosphere of Bohemian painting.&lt;ref&gt;A. Kutal, 1972, p. 57&lt;/ref&gt; Although the overall stylistic conception of the picture has a number of features that correspond to the work of the [[Master of Vyšší Brod|Master of the Vyšší Brod Altarpiece]], it is in fact a later work by another artist that represents a progression from mystically religious expression to a dramatic presentation of reality and the intensifying of its effect.
 
Opinion is divided among art historians as to the work’s Bohemian origin, some of them considering it to be the work of an Austrian artist who emerged from the workshop of the Master of the Klosterneuburg Altarpiece (de: ''Meister der Rückseite des Verduner Altars'').&lt;ref&gt;G. Schmidt: Zur Kaufmann’schen Kreuzigung. In: G. Schmidt: Malerei der Gotik. Fixpunkte und Ausblicke. Graz 2005&lt;/ref&gt; This is also connected with the dating of the work that some, in connection with the Klosterneuburg Altarpiece (1331) have pinpointed to the later period of [[John of Bohemia|John of Luxembourg]] (1340)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stavitele-katedral.cz/marek-zagora-jan-lucembursky-ve-vizualnich-pramenech-stredoveku/ Marek Zágora: Jan Lucemburský ve vizuálních pramenech středověku]&lt;/ref&gt; while others judge it to be influenced by Italian art (such the picture The Crucifixion by [[Simone Martini]] of 1342) and consider it more likely to have been painted after 1350.&lt;ref&gt;Dostál E, Umění XI, 1938, pp. 353-361&lt;/ref&gt;

In its form, the Kaufmann Crucifixion is a perfect work that has no parallels in European painting of that period. Several of its motifs were later often adopted, especially that of the man sitting on the ground with one leg bent and the other stretched out. Works inspired by the Kaufmann Crucifixion can be evidenced in surviving panel paintings, though also in [[Illuminated manuscript|manuscript illuminations]] in Bohemia and other countries.&lt;ref&gt;J. Fajt, 2006, p. 77&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Literature Wales''' is the Welsh national literature promotion agency and society of writers, existing to promote [[Welsh-language literature|Welsh-language]] and [[Welsh literature in English|English-language]] literature in Wales.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.literaturewales.org/ Official website]&lt;/ref&gt; It offers bursaries for writing projects, runs literary events and lectures, and provides financial assistance for creative mentoring and other literary-based ventures. The organisation also selects the [[National Poet for Wales]], and manages competitions including [[Wales Book of the Year]], the Cardiff International Poetry Competition, and the [[Rhys Davies (writer)|Rhys Davies]] Short Story Competition.

==History==
[[File:Ty N.jpg|right|200x200px|Tŷ Newydd Writing Centre]]
The Academi was initially formed as a [[Welsh language]] society in 1959, following a public discussion between [[Bobi Jones|Robert Maynard Jones]] and poet [[Waldo Williams]]. The Academi attracted notable Welsh writers and academics into its society from the start, and while a Welsh language-only publication, had as its chairmen [[Iorwerth Peate]] (1959–63), [[T. J. Morgan]] (1963–66) and [[J. E. Caerwyn Williams]] (1966–1975).&lt;ref name="CttLoW"&gt;{{cite book |editor1-first=Meic |editor1-last=Stephens |editor1-link=Meic Stephens |author2= |title=The New Companion to the Literature of Wales |year=1998 |publisher=University of Wales Press |location=Cardiff |page=5|isbn=0-7083-1383-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; An English language section was added in 1968 through the initiative of editor and linguist [[Meic Stephens]] in his then capacity as literature director of the [[Arts Council of Wales|Welsh Arts Council]]. The first chairman of the English language section was [[Glyn Jones (Welsh writer)|Glyn Jones]] who held the post until 1973. He was followed by [[Roland Mathias]] (1973–78), [[Gwyn Jones (physicist)|G.O. Jones]] (1978–81), Sam Adams (1981–84), [[Tony Curtis (Welsh poet)|Tony Curtis]] (1984–87), [[Gillian Clarke]] (1987–1993) and [[Sally Roberts Jones]] (1993–1997). The Welsh language chairmen after J. E. Caerwyn Williams were R.M. Jones (1975–78), Alun Llywellyn-Williams (1978–82), [[R. Gerallt Jones]] (1982–87), [[R. Geraint Gruffydd]] (1987–90), [[Gwenlyn Parry]] (1990–91), [[Harri Pritchard Jones]] (1991–96) and Nesta Wyn Jones (1996–98).&lt;ref name="CttLoW"/&gt;

The Academi has been constitutionally independent since 1978 and took on an enlarged role in 1998 when it was reformed as a single organisation operating through two languages and won the [[Arts Council of Wales]]' franchise to provide the national literature support service for Wales.

On 1 April 2011, the Academi changed its title to Literature Wales, simultaneously merging with the writers' centre [[Tŷ Newydd]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.welshicons.org.uk/news/literature/academi-and-ty-newydd-join-to-create-literature-wales/ Welsh Icons: "Academi and Tŷ Newydd join to create Literature Wales"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727195359/http://www.welshicons.org.uk/news/literature/academi-and-ty-newydd-join-to-create-literature-wales/ |date=27 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Activities==
[[Image:Academi at WMC.jpg|thumb|Literature Wales (previously the Academi at the Wales Millennium Centre]]
Literature Wales operates the "Writers on Tour" scheme, which facilitates and helps to fund the placement of writers in schools, interest groups and organisations across Wales for literary lectures, discussions and workshops. It also administers the [[National Poet for Wales]] post ([[Gwyneth Lewis]] – 2005, [[Gwyn Thomas (poet)|Gwyn Thomas]] – 2006), ''Bardd Plant Cymru'' ([[Gwyneth Glyn]]); the Welsh-language Children's Laureate joint scheme between [[S4C]], The [[Welsh Books Council]], Literature Wales and [[Urdd Gobaith Cymru]], and in 2005, administered the Cardiff Capital Poet project ([[Gillian Clarke]]). Managed by Literature Wales, the [[Glyn Jones Centre]], based in the [[Wales Millennium Centre]], provides a space for visitors and writers to gain and exchange information on the practice, publication and promotion of writing. The centre houses a large collection of Welsh-interest literature. 

Following a [[National Lottery (United Kingdom)|lottery grant]] from the [[Arts Council of Wales]], Literature Wales produced The Welsh Academy Encyclopaedia of Wales (published by [[University of Wales Press]] in 2008). The encyclopaedia was published in both Welsh and English and aims to combine the coverage of a [[gazetteer]] and [[biographical dictionary]] with the authority of a historical dictionary and the utility of a [[guide book]].

Literature Wales's website provides a service as a guide to literary activity in Wales and beyond, including a database of all known writers, funding bodies, writers’ groups, publishers and periodicals currently active in Wales, listings of current poetry and story writing competitions and details of opportunities for writers. It also offers advice on getting published and publishing in general, as well as providing information on the other literature bodies and organisations in Wales.

==Controversy==
The organisation of the awards presentation of the Academi's Wales Book of the Year competition 2008 was criticised after then Culture Minister [[Rhodri Glyn Thomas]] announced the wrong winner, although it was a simple mistake.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/7488299.stm BBC NEWS | Wales |Wrong winner book event defended]&lt;/ref&gt;  

Literature Wales has campaigned against the Welsh Journals Online project of the [[National Library of Wales]] because it argues that authors should be paid in return for permission to allow their material to be digitised.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/7209875.stm BBC News | Wales | Writers' digital row with Library]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organisation==
As a [[Charitable organization|registered charity]], Literature Wales is funded from public sources (largely the Arts Council of Wales, local authorities and a number of trusts), from members' subscriptions and to a lesser degree, from trading and literary activity. Its main offices are in Cardiff, sited at the Wales Millennium Centre, and there is also a small office based at Ty Newydd in [[Llanystumdwy]] in north Wales.     

Literature Wales's chief executive is Lleucu Siencyn&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-15650494 (accessed 14 January 2012)&lt;/ref&gt; who replaces the previous chief executive, the poet and author [[Peter Finch (poet)|Peter Finch]].

'''Los Alcornocales Natural Park''' (in Spanish, '''Parque natural de Los Alcornocales''') is a [[natural park (Spain)|natural park]] located in the south of [[Spain]], in the autonomous community of [[Andalusia]]; it is shared between the provinces of [[Cádiz (province)|Cádiz]] and [[Málaga (province)|Málaga]]. The natural park occupies a territory spanning seventeen municipalities with a total population of about 380,000.  "Los Alcornocales" means "the cork oak groves". 

Nearly all of the uninhabited land in the park is covered by Mediterranean native forest. While some of the land has been cleared for cattle ranches, much of the human activity in the park is devoted to exploitation of the forest's resources: [[hunting]] wild game, collecting [[Mushroom hunting|wild mushrooms]], and foraging for good specimens of [[tree heath]]. 
The tree heath (''Erica arborea'', called "brezos" in Spanish) is a small evergreen shrub, rarely more than two or three meters high; it is the source of the reddish briar-root wood used in making tobacco pipes, and its wood is excellent raw material for making [[charcoal]].

Above all, however, the park's forests are exploited for the production of [[Cork (material)|cork]].  The [[cork oak]] (''Quercus suber'') is a tree with a spongy layer of material lying between the outer surface of its bark and the underlying living layer called the ''[[phloem]]'' (which, in turn, encloses the non-living woody stem.)  Cork is generated by a specialized layer of tissue called ''[[cork cambium]]''.  Properly done, harvesting cork from a given tree can be undertaken every ten to twelve years without damaging the tree; the cork cambium simply regenerates it. Cork has many commercial uses, including wine-bottle stoppers, bulletin boards, coasters, insulation, sealing material for jar lids, flooring, gaskets for engines, fishing bobbers, handles for fishing rods and tennis rackets, etc.

==Climate==
Given the geographic position of Los Alcornocales, the dominant climate in the zone is, logically, [[Mediterranean climate|Mediterranean]], but a series of factors contribute to its uniqueness. Its close proximity to the sea helps keep the temperature relatively mild all year long. The average rainfall usually reaches over 800 L/m², with certain zones receiving more than 1,400 L/m² thanks to the ocean front. In the mountain ranges to the south, there are great fogs known as the ''barbas del Levante'' (the beards of the east wind). These fogs provide the humidity to form precipitation during the long dry seasons that usually characterize Mediterranean climates. The strong East wind is known as El Levante, and is associated with high temperatures.  The wind from the West, which frequently brings rain, is known as El Poniente. These winds make this area one of the best places to construct [[wind farm]]s in all of Spain.

==Flora==
[[Image:Korkeiche Andalusien2004.jpg|thumb|Trunk of a cork tree]]
The park is characterized by the most extensive forest of cork in Spain and one of the largest in the world. In contrast to the mountains of cork in other latitudes where the tree density is low, in this zone the trees form an authentic forest with a rich variety of shrub and herbaceous vegetation intimately connected.  This assures a natural regeneration of the forest, a good mix of ages, and a high level of floral and animal [[biodiversity]].

Forests and smaller wooded areas within the park are comprised mainly by [[Cork oak|cork oaks]] (''Quercus suber''), [[Portuguese oak|Portuguese oaks]] (''Quercus faginea''), [[Pyrenean oak]]s (''Quercus pyrenaica''), [[Olive|olive trees]] (''Olea europaea''), [[alder]]s (''Alnus glutinosa''), [[Holly|holly trees]] (''Ilex aquifolium''), [[Bay laurel|bay laurels]] (''Laurus nobilis''), [[Rhododendron ponticum|rhododendrons]] (''Rhododendron ponticum''), [[fern]]s, [[moss]]es, and [[lichen]]s.

==History==

The cork oak groves of Los Alcornocales are situated in a strategic place.  They sit astride two important axes, one an east-west axis, the other north-south.  The land here has allegiances to both the [[Atlantic Ocean]] and the [[Mediterranean Sea]]; similarly, it forms the throat of a bridge between [[Europe]] and [[Africa]], a bridge broken only by the narrow [[Strait of Gibraltar]]. Its geographic position is the circumstance, as much as its climate, topography, or suitability for agriculture, that has dictated its patrimony.

[[Image:CorchoAlcornocales.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Cork collected from oaks]]
The area has been populated for tens of thousands of years. This is attested by the presence of archaeological remnants of settlements by [[Neanderthal]]s dating back more than thirty thousand years, as well as stone implements, engravings, and cave paintings from both the [[Paleolithic]] and [[Neolithic]] ages. Of the greatest interest to visitors, however, are the Bronze Age cave dwellings that dot the area. Of more than fifty caves discovered so far, there are three that have special artistic value: the Cueva del Tajo de las Figuras (Cave of the Figures on the Precipice), which has been compared to the [[Sistine Chapel]] among examples of cave art; the Cave of the High Laja, that houses pictures of the earliest-known boats to ply the Mediterranean; and the [[Cave of Bacinete]], with more than a hundred pictographic representations in a magnificent state of conservation. 

Later in history, a succession of civilizations and cultures, one superimposed on the next, has dominated this area, all of whom have contributed to its ethnological character. Each has left its marks on the landscape; there are megalíthic monuments, Iberian, Phoenician, and Roman ruins, Arab strongholds, etc. Many of the towns that today comprise the park reached their highest state of civilization during the Muslim [[Nasrid dynasty]], when this area was on the western fringe of the [[Kingdom of Granada]]. Today, in this area, many examples of the architecture introduced during the period of Muslim occupation survive; among them are the unique [[White Towns of Andalusia]]. [[Jimena de la Frontera]], [[Castellar de la Frontera]], and [[Medina Sidonia]] are magnificent examples.

==Caves==
The '''Cueva del Tajo de las Figuras''', located near the town of [[Benalup-Casas Viejas]], belongs to the group of paleolithic and neolithic sites in southern [[Spain]] that have examples of rock art that the Spanish call "[[art sureño]]" (southern art). In 1913, [[Juan Cabré]] and [[Eduardo Hernández-Pacheco]] began the first systematic studies of "art sureño" at this cave. The paintings are mostly representations of birds and odd four-footed man-like figures dating from neolithic times.
[[Image:Tajo-x.jpg|left|thumb|Cave painting of deer at Tajo de las Figuras]]

In 1924 the ''Cueva del Tajo de las Figuras'' was declared an Artistic Architectonic Monument by the Spanish state.  For several decades, in order that visitors might better able to discern the paintings on the wall, tour guides have repeatedly sprayed water on them.  This practice has resulted in the deposition of layers of lime on the paintings.  Beginning in 2005, an effort to restore them was undertaken.

==The ecological disaster at La Janda==
[[Image:Grus grus 1 (Marek Szczepanek).jpg|250px|right|thumb|A Eurasian crane]]
Near the ''Cueva del Tajo de las Figuras'' was the ancient ''Laguna de la Janda'', a haven where millions of birds, both resident and migratory species, found a suitable habitat for feeding and reproduction. Unfortunately, during the middle part of the twentieth century, this important ecological niche was destroyed.  To support local rice-growing, water from the lagoon and its associated fresh-water wetlands was diverted, and the area dried up almost completely.  In the process, the last reproductive Spanish population of the [[Common crane|Eurasian crane]] (''Grus grus'') was lost as well.

==Towns and cities within the park==

[[Image:RutaMolinos.jpg|thumb|Path near [[Alcalá de los Gazules]]]]
All or part of sixteen municipalities of the [[Cádiz (province)|Province of Cádiz]] lie within the Natural Park of Los Alcornocales : [[Alcalá de los Gazules]], [[Algar, Cádiz|Algar]], [[Algeciras]], [[Arcos de la Frontera]], [[Benalup-Casas Viejas]], [[Benaocaz]], [[Castellar de la Frontera]], [[El Bosque, Cádiz|El Bosque]], [[Jerez de la Frontera]], [[Jimena de la Frontera]], [[Los Barrios]], [[Medina-Sidonia]], [[Prado del Rey]], [[San José del Valle]], [[Tarifa]] and [[Ubrique]]. Likewise, there is one town in Málaga province, [[Cortes de la Frontera]], that has land within park boundaries. There are lots of paths connecting these municipalities, nowadays used for [[hiking]].

'''Luxe Grunge''' (also known as '''[[boho-chic]]''' or '''"luxe bohemian"''' &lt;ref&gt;See ''The Times'', 2 November 2006&lt;/ref&gt;) is a [[chic]]er updated [[grunge]]-boho collection; an unkempt approach to wardrobe, popularized by celebrities such as the [[Olsen twins]].{{fact|date=December 2017}}

First motivated by [[Seattle]]'s groundbreaking rock scene in the 1990s – the modern update contains all the mainstays of yesterday’s grunge (flannel, plaid, layers and leg warmers) alongside today’s sophisticated pieces, including capes, shawls and jackets (''[www.theitlists.com], Sept 2006''). Grunge elements featured strongly in fashion collections in Autumn 2006, including styles referred to "cocktail grunge" and "modern [[Gothic fashion|goth]]".&lt;ref&gt;''Sunday Times Style'', 24 September 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Lisa Armstrong]], fashion editor of the London ''Times'', referred to [[Patrick Lichfield]]'s iconic 1969 photograph of [[Talitha Getty]] on a Marrakesh roof-top as "typif[ying] the luxe bohemian look" &lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 2 November 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

Certain celebrities have been sporting this look, most notably [[Taylor Momsen]].{{fact|date=December 2017}}

'''Made-to-measure''' (MTM) typically refers to custom clothing that is cut and sewn using a standard-sized base pattern. [[Suit (clothing)|Suits]] and [[sport coat]]s are the most common garments made-to-measure. The fit of a made-to-measure garment is expected to be superior to that of a [[ready-to-wear]] garment because  made-to-measure garments are constructed to fit each customer individually based on a few body measurements to customize the pre-existing pattern. 
Made-to-measure garments always involve some form of [[standardization]] in the pattern and manufacturing, whereas [[bespoke tailoring]] is  entirely made from scratch based on a customer's specifications with far more attention to minute fit details and using multiple fittings during the construction process. 
All else being equal, a made-to-measure garment will be more expensive than a ready-to-wear garment but cheaper than a bespoke one. "Custom made" most often refers to MTM. [[Country of origin]] makes a difference in pricing, with [[made in China]] MTM garments typically priced below [[made in Italy]] ready-to-wear.

== Overview ==
To order a made-to-measure garment, the customer's measurements are first taken by a made-to-measure retailer. Then a base pattern is selected that most closely corresponds with the customer’s measurements. This base pattern is altered to match the customer’s measurements. The garment is constructed from this altered pattern.

The primary benefits to the customer of made-to-measure clothing are that the garments will be well-fitted to the customer's body and the customer may have the opportunity to customize the fabric and detailing. The primary disadvantage of made-to-measure is that the customer must wait up to several weeks for the garment to be sewn and delivered. A typical price markup for a made-to-measure item is 15% over the price of its ready-to-wear counterpart.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

Made-to-measure retailers often travel internationally meeting clients in cities, providing samples of the latest materials and styles.

Unlike [[bespoke tailoring|bespoke]] garments, which traditionally involves hand sewing, made-to-measure manufacturers use both machine- and hand-sewing. Made-to-measure also requires fewer fittings than bespoke, resulting in a shorter wait between customer measurement and garment delivery.

Made-to-measure is sometimes also referred to as personal [[tailoring]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/ae6e1c54-df24-11db-b5c9-000b5df10621.html|title=Just how personal can you get|last=Brooke|first=Simon|date=March 31, 2007|work=Financial Times|accessdate=2008-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years tailoring has evolved further with young companies like Artefact London, that make a blend of made-to-measure and bespoke approaches. A base pattern is used to gauge your measurements and your unique pattern is created electronically with all alterations accounted for prior to cutting. Thus alleviating the need for baste fitting that is mandatory in bespoke with very minor alterations (if any) needed at the fitting.

== Advertising Standards Authority ruling ==
In the [[United Kingdom]], the legal definition of “made-to-measure” has been conflated with [[bespoke tailoring]] by a ruling of the  [[Advertising Standards Authority (United Kingdom)|Advertising Standards Authority]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asa.org.uk/asa/adjudications/Public/TF_ADJ_44555.htm |title=Sartoriani London |accessdate=2008-10-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081122150946/http://www.asa.org.uk/asa/adjudications/Public/TF_ADJ_44555.htm |archivedate=2008-11-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ruling is based on the [[Oxford English Dictionary]] definition of bespoke as "made to order".  While this ruling clarified the difference between bespoke and ready-to-wear, it had the effect of blurring the line between bespoke and made-to-measure.

The ruling established that a "made-to-measure suit would be cut, usually by machine, from an existing pattern, and adjusted according to the customer's measurements," while "a bespoke suit would be fully hand-made and the pattern cut from scratch, with an intermediary baste stage which involved a first fitting so that adjustments could be made to a half-made suit." The ruling concluded, however, that a "majority of people... would not expect that bespoke suit to be fully hand-made with the pattern cut from scratch," effectively equalizing the terms bespoke and made-to-measure.

While etymologist Michael Quinion observed that by definition "it was legitimate for a tailor offering clothes cut and sewn by machine to refer to them as bespoke, provided that they were made to the customer's measurements",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.worldwidewords.org/qa/qa-bes4.htm |title= bespoke|accessdate=2008-10-09 |publisher=Michael Quinion |date= September 13, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; since the traditional use of bespoke inside the tailoring community has been more nuanced than the Oxford definition,&lt;ref name="Sim"&gt;{{cite web

Zuckerberg came up with the idea as part of his New Year's Resolution for 2015 after Cynthia Greco, the Audience Development Manager for MediaOnePA/York Newspaper Company, suggested that Zuckerberg read a new book every month. Zuckerberg modified the idea to one book every two weeks and books which "emphasize learning about new cultures, beliefs, histories and technologies."&lt;ref name=chowdhry/&gt;

The '''Musée international d'Art naïf Anatole Jakovsky''' (Eng.: Anatole Jakovsky International Museum of Naive Art) is a [[museum]] located in [[Nice]], which displays 18-to-21st century works specialized in [[naive art]]. The museum was inaugurated on 5 March 1982.

==History and description==
The museum was housed in the Château Saint Hélène which was the former residence of perfumer François Coty, and is located in a large park. In 1930, his ex-wife Yvonne decide to order changes in the building by Nice architect H. Malgaud who removed the sets designed by Aaron Messiah. Her daughter Christiane Coty sold the castle to the city of Nice on 6 April 1973, and the building was eventually transformed into a museum, which opened in 1982.&lt;ref name="Nice"&gt;{{cite web |title=Musée International d'Art Naïf ANATOLE JAKOVSKY |url=http://www.nice.fr/Culture/Musees-et-expositions/Musee-d-Art-Naif |publisher=nice.fr |language=French |accessdate=13 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The works are composed of paintings, sculptures, drawings, posters by painters such as [[Henri Rousseau]], [[Séraphine Louis]], [[Grandma Moses]], O'Brady, Rimbert, Ivan and Josip Généralic, Bauchant, Vivin, Lackovic, Haddelsey, Ligabue, Vivancos, among others...&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Musée international d'Art naïf Anatole Jakovsky |url=http://www.evene.fr/culture/lieux/musee-international-d-art-naif-anatole-jakovsky-709.php |publisher=evene.fr |language=French |accessdate=13 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The collection come from donations of Renée and [[Anatole Jakovsky]] (to whom the museum owes its current name), and the [[Centre Georges Pompidou]]. The giant statues in the garden were created by Frédéric Lanovsky.&lt;ref name="Nice"/&gt; The museum has about 20,000 visitors per year, and 600 works from 27 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=NICE: Les naïfs à la plage |url=http://www.lexpress.fr/informations/nice-les-naifs-a-la-plage_595142.html |journal=[[L'Express (France)|L'Express]] |publisher=Express-Roularta Group |place=Paris |date=1 July 1993 |language=French |accessdate=13 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was founded on August 22, 1961, by the Cuban [[poet]], [[Nicolas Guillen]]. Initially their objective was uniting the intellectuals within the young [[Cuban Revolution]] to maintain a genuine Cuban culture. The group issued ''La Gaceta de Cuba'' beginning in 1962.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.uneac.org.cu/publicaciones/la-gaceta-de-cuba |accessdate=25 February 2017 |title=La Gaceta de Cuba |publisher=UNEAC |language=es }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cuban violinist and professor [[Evelio Tieles]] was President of the Music Section from 1977 to 1984.&lt;ref name="Evelio"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ecured.cu/Evelio_Tieles_Ferrer|title=Evelio Tieles Ferrer-Ecured|accessdate=June 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5018">The term '''New Leipzig School''' ({{lang-de|Neue Leipziger Schule}}) refers to a movement in modern German painting.  The usage and origins of this term are debated.&lt;ref&gt;E.g. [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/10/02/AR2006100201431.html New Leipzig School Provides a Study in Hype] Blake Gopnik, ''[[The Washington Post]]'', 3 October 2006. {{en icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and characteristics==
The "old" Leipzig School was a term used by art journalists which had become established by some time no later than 1977, and the involvement of [[Werner Tübke]], [[Wolfgang Mattheuer]] and [[Bernhard Heisig]]&lt;ref name=nyt&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2006/01/08/magazine/08leipzig.html?_r=2&amp;pagewanted=print The New Leipzig School] Arthur Lubow, ''[[The New York Times]]'', 8 January 2006. {{en icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=welt&gt;[https://www.welt.de/wams_print/article1746491/Das_Unbehagen_mit_der_Neuen_Leipziger_Schule.html Das Unbehagen mit der Neuen Leipziger Schule] ''[[Die Welt]]'', 2 March 2008. {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; with [[documenta]] 6.  The students of those artists, including Sighard Gille and [[Arno Rink]], can be seen as the second generation of the Leipzig School.

The New Leipzig School, as a third generation, relates to the post-[[Reunification of Germany|reunification]] climate of modern Germany&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/how-the-leipzig-artists-are-taking-on-the-world-477557.html How the Leipzig artists are taking on the world] Tony Paterson, ''[[The Independent]]'', 10 May 2006. {{en icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is closely linked with the [[Hochschule für Grafik und Buchkunst Leipzig]].  It usually refers to the students of Gille and Rink,&lt;ref name=zeit&gt;[http://www.zeit.de/2005/30/Leipziger-Maler Neuen Leipziger Schule: Die stille Revolte] Christian Schüle, ''[[Die Zeit]]'', 21 July 2005. {{de icon}} Available in English [http://www.signandsight.com/features/287.html here].&lt;/ref&gt; but occasionally those of Rolf Kuhrt or even Heisig or Tübke.  Its works tend to be characterised by a combination of figurative and abstract elements.  Clear messages, which were characteristic of the "first" Leipzig generation of painters, are no longer present.

The list of painters that are classified in this school is not fixed, but has included [[Neo Rauch]],&lt;ref name="nyt"/&gt;&lt;ref name=welt /&gt;&lt;ref name=zeit /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artinfo.com/news/story/25190/neo-rauch/ The AI Interview: Neo Rauch] Robert Ayers, ''[[ARTINFO]]'', 6 June 2007. {{en icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Christoph Ruckhäberle]]&lt;ref name=nyt /&gt;&lt;ref name=welt /&gt;&lt;ref name=zeit /&gt; and [[Matthias Weischer]].&lt;ref name=nyt /&gt;&lt;ref name=welt /&gt;&lt;ref name=zeit /&gt; Others who have been associated with the term include [[Tim Eitel]], [[Tilo Baumgärtel]], [[Christian Brandl]], [[David Schnell]], [[Martin Kobe]], [[Michael Triegel]], [[Ulf Puder]], [[Rosa Loy]] and [[Axel Krause]].

A significant role in the success of the "New Leipzig School" was played by the gallery owner Gerd Harry Lybke,&lt;ref name=nyt /&gt;&lt;ref name=welt /&gt;&lt;ref name=zeit /&gt; who introduced the works of Rauch in particular to the globally important American art market.  Other Leipzig artists were able to achieve international acclaim in the wake of this, such as the Greek-German painter [[Aris Kalaizis]].  Parallels can be seen between these successes and those of the [[Young British Artists]].  Also crucial for the Leipzig painters' success was Matthias Kleindienst,&lt;ref name=nyt /&gt;&lt;ref name=goethe&gt;[http://www.goethe.de/kue/bku/msi/mui/en4832829.htm International Hotspot, Hip Community or Art Ghetto? – the Leipziger Baumwollspinnerei] Sigrun Hellmich, [[Goethe-Institut]], July 2009. {{en icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; gallery owner and head of the [[woodcut]]ting workshop at the [[Hochschule für Grafik und Buchkunst Leipzig|Hochschule]], whose search for talent paved the way for many young Leipzig artists, including Weischer. Another major factor in their market success was the "LIGA" art project, established in [[Berlin]] in 2002 under the direction of Christian Ehrentraut, a former collaborator with Lybke.&lt;ref name=nyt /&gt;

Most of the artists tagged as "Leipzig School" members reject the classification.  The art historical community has also consistently avoided the term on account of its vagueness and imprecision.  However, it is widely used as a label and marketing tool in the world of art dealership.&lt;ref name=welt /&gt;

Many painters and galleries associated with the School are based in the "Music District" (''Musikviertel'') in the south-western part of the inner city, and more recently at the [[Leipziger Baumwollspinnerei|Leipzig Cotton Mill]] in Plagwitz.&lt;ref name=nyt /&gt;&lt;ref name=welt /&gt;&lt;ref name=zeit /&gt;&lt;ref name=goethe /&gt;

'''Palestinian costumes''' are the traditional [[clothing]] worn by [[Palestinians]]. Foreign travelers to [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] in the 19th and early 20th centuries often commented on the rich variety of the costumes worn, particularly by the [[fellaheen]] or village women. Many of the handcrafted garments were richly embroidered and the creation and maintenance of these items played a significant role in the lives of the region's women.

Though experts in the field trace the origins of Palestinian costumes to ancient times, there are no surviving clothing [[artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]] from this early period against which the modern items might be definitively compared. Influences from the various [[empires]] to have ruled Palestine, such as [[Ancient Egypt]], [[Ancient Rome]] and the [[Byzantine empire]], among others, have been documented by scholars largely based on the depictions in art and descriptions in literature of costumes produced during these times.

Until the 1940s, traditional Palestinian costumes reflected a woman's economic and marital status and her town or district of origin, with knowledgeable observers discerning this information from the [[fabric]], colours, [[Cut (clothing)|cut]], and [[embroidery]] motifs (or lack thereof) used in the apparel.&lt;ref name=Grutz&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.saudiaramcoworld.com/issue/199101/woven.legacy.woven.language.htm|author=Jane Waldron Grutz|date=January–February 1991|title=Woven Legacy, Woven Language|publisher=Saudi Aramco World}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
[[Image:Young women of Bethlehem in costume, Holy Land-LCCN2002725085.tif|thumb|widthpx|Palestinian young woman of Bethlehem in costume, Holy Land, between 1890 and 1900]]
Geoff Emberling, director of the [[University of Chicago Oriental Institute|Oriental Institute]] Museum, notes that Palestinian clothing from the early 19th century to [[World War I]] show "traces of similar styles of clothing represented in art over 3,000 years ago."&lt;ref name=Chicago&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www-news.uchicago.edu/releases/06/061109.palestinianclothing.shtml|title=Palestinian women used clothes to make more than a fashion statement|publisher=University of Chicago News Office|date=9 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hanan Munayyer, collector and researcher of Palestinian clothing, sees examples of proto-Palestinian attire in artifacts from the Canaanite period (1500 BCE) such as Egyptian paintings depicting [[Canaanites]] in A-shaped garments.&lt;ref name=Twair&gt;{{cite web|author=Pat McDonnell Twair|date=October 2006|title=Sovereign Threads|publisher=Palestine Heritage Foundation|url=http://www.palestineheritage.org/Newsletter_December_2006.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Munayyer says that from 1200 BC to 1940 AD, all Palestinian dresses were cut from natural fabrics in a similar A-line shape with triangular sleeves.&lt;ref name=Twair/&gt; This shape is known to [[archaeology|archaeologists]] as the "Syrian tunic" and appears in artifacts such as an ivory engraving from [[Tel Megiddo|Megiddo]] dating to 1200 BC.&lt;ref name=Twair/&gt;&lt;ref name=Oneal&gt;{{cite web|author=Denise O'Neal|date=September–October 2005|title=Threads of Tradition:An Exhibition of Palestinian Folk Dress at Antiochian Village|publisher=Palestine Heritage Association|url=http://www.palestineheritage.org/Threads%20of%20Tradition_Antiochian%20Museum.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Palestine: Ancient and Modern'' (1949) produced by the Royal Ontario Museum of Archaeology, [[Winifred Needler]] writes that:{{quote|No actual clothing from ancient Palestine has survived and detailed descriptions are lacking in the ancient literature. In their length, fullness, and use of pattern these modern garments bear a general resemblance to the costumes of [[West Asia]]tic people seen in ancient Egyptian and [[Assyrian empire|Assyrian]] monuments. The dress of the daughters of [[Zion]] mentioned in [[Isaiah]] 3:22-24, with 'changeable suits of apparel,' 'mantles,' 'wimples,' 'hoods,' 'vails,' and 'girdles', suggests that feminine city fashions of Isaiah's day may have resembled modern Palestinian country dress.&lt;ref name=Needler&gt;{{harvnb|Needler|1949|p. 87}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Needler also cites well-preserved costume artifacts from late Roman-Egyptian times consisting of "loose linen garments with patterned woven bands of wool, shoes and sandals and linen caps," as comparable to modern Palestinian costumes.[6]

The shift from [[weaving|woven]] to [[embroidery|embroidered]] designs was made possible by artisanal manufacture of fine needles in [[Damascus]] in the 8th century. Embroidered dress sections, like the square chest piece (qabbeh) and decorated back panel (shinyar) prevalent in Palestinian dresses, are also found in costume from 13th century [[Andalusia]]. Each village in Palestine had motifs that served as identifying markers for local women.&lt;ref name=Twair/&gt; Common patterns included the eight-pointed star, the moon, birds, palm leaves, stairs, and diamonds or triangles used as amulets to ward off the evil eye.&lt;ref name=Chicago/&gt;&lt;ref name=Twair/&gt;

==Social and gender variations==
Traditionally, Palestinian society has been divided into three groups: villagers, townspeople, and [[Bedouins]]. Palestinian costumes reflected differences in the physical and social mobility enjoyed by men and women in these different groups in Palestinian society.

The villagers, referred to in Arabic as ''[[fellaheen]]'', lived in relative isolation, so that the older, more traditional costume designs were found most frequently in the dress of village women. The specificity of local village designs was such that, "A Palestinian woman's village could be deduced from the embroidery on her dress."&lt;ref name=Weirp68&gt;Weir, 1989, p. 68.&lt;/ref&gt;

Townspeople, ([[Arabic language|Arabic]]: ''beladin'') had increased access to news and an openness to outside influences that was naturally also reflected in the costumes, with town fashions exhibiting a more impermanent nature than those of the village. By the early 20th century, well to-do women (and men) in the cities had mostly adopted a Western style of dress. Typically, [[Ghada Karmi]] recalls in her autobiography how in the 1940s in the wealthy Arab district of [[Katamon]], Jerusalem, only the maids, who were local village women, donned traditional Palestinian dresses.

Due to their nomadic life-style, Bedouin costume reflected tribal affiliations, rather than their affiliations to a localized geographic area.

As in most of the [[Middle East]], clothing for men had a more uniform style than women's clothing.

==Weaving and fabrics==
[[File:Scandein0012.jpg|thumb|Bedouin woman in [[Jerusalem]], 1880s]]
Woolen fabrics for everyday use were produced by weavers in [[Al-Majdal, Askalan|Majdal]], [[Bethlehem]], [[Ramallah]], and [[Jerusalem]]. The wool could be from sheep, goats or camels.&lt;ref name=Gillowp112&gt;Gillow, John (2010) ''Textiles of the Islamic World''. Thames and Hudson. {{ISBN|978-0-500-51527-3}}. p.112.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kawar, Widad Kamel (2011) ''Threads of Identity''. Melisende. {{ISBN|978-9963-610-41-9}}. p.185.&lt;/ref&gt; Weaving among the [[Bedouins]] was and is still traditionally carried out by women to create domestic items, such as tents, rugs, and pillow covers. Thread is spun from sheep's wool, colored with [[natural dyes]], and woven into a strong fabric using a ground loom.&lt;ref name=Sunbula&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sunbula.org/crafttrad.shtml |title=Craft traditions from Palestine |publisher=Sunbula |accessdate=July 18, 2012 |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080321111836/http://www.sunbula.org/crafttrad.shtml |archivedate=March 21, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Linen woven on hand-[[loom]]s and cotton were mainstay fabrics for embroidered garments,&lt;ref name=Balfourp143/&gt; though cotton was not widely used until the end of the 19th century when it began to be imported from Europe.&lt;ref name=Gillowp112/&gt; Fabrics could be left uncoloured or dyed various colours, the most popular being deep blue using [[Indigofera tinctoria|indigo]], others being black, red and green. In 1870 there were ten dyeing workshops in the [[Muristan|Murestan]] quarter of Jerusalem, employing around 100 men.&lt;ref name=Baldenp164&gt;Baldensperger, 1903,  p.[https://archive.org/stream/quarterlystateme35pale#page/164/mode/2up 164]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Weir, ''Palestinian Costumes''. p.26.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Shelagh Weir, the colour produced by indigo (''nileh'') was believed to ward off the evil eye, and frequently used for coats in the Galilee and dresses in southern Palestine.&lt;ref name=Balfourp143&gt;Balfour-Paul, 1997, p. 143.&lt;/ref&gt; Indigo dyed heavy cotton was also used to make sirwals or shirwals, cotton trousers worn by men and women that were baggy from the waist down but tailored tight around the calves or ankles. The wealthier the region, the darker the blue produced; cloth could be dipped in the vat and left to set as many as nine times. Dresses with the heaviest and most intricate embroidery, often described as 'black', were made of heavy cotton or linen of a very dark blue.&lt;ref name=Balfourp144/&gt; Travellers to Palestine in the 19th and 20th centuries represented pastoral scenes of peasant women donned in blue going about their daily tasks, in art and literature.&lt;ref name=Balfourp143/&gt;

Because of the hot climate and for reasons of prestige, dresses were cut voluminously, particularly in the south, often running twice the length of the human body with the excess being wrapped up into a belt. For more festive dresses in southern Palestine, silks where imported from [[Syria]] with some from [[Egypt]].&lt;ref name=Kawarp41/&gt; For example, a fashion of the Bethlehem area was to interlay stripes of indigo-blue linen with those of silk.&lt;ref name=Balfourp144&gt;Balfour-Paul, 1997, p. 144.&lt;/ref&gt;

Fashions in towns followed those in [[Damascus]], Syria.&lt;ref name=Kawarp41&gt;Kawar. p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt; Some producers in [[Aleppo]], [[Hama]] and Damascus produced styles specifically for the Palestinian market.&lt;ref name=Gillowp110&gt;Gillow. p.110&lt;/ref&gt; Weavers in [[Homs]] produced belts and some shawls exclusively for export to [[Nablus]] and Jerusalem.&lt;ref&gt;Kawar, p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Majdali.jpg|thumb|Majdali weaving. Gaza 1950's]]
The production of cloth for traditional Palestinian costumes and for export throughout the [[Arab world]] was a key industry of the destroyed village of [[Al-Majdal, Askalan|Majdal]]. Majdalawi fabric was produced by a male weaver on a single treadle loom using black and indigo cotton threads combined with fuchsia and turquoise silk threads. While the village no longer exists today, the craft of Majdalawi weaving continues as part of a cultural preservation project run by the Atfaluna Crafts organization and the Arts and Crafts Village in [[Gaza City]].&lt;ref name=Sunbula/&gt;

==Palestinian embroidery==
[[File:Peasant woman.jpg|thumb|right| Village woman, circa 1900]]
Diverse motifs were favored in Palestinian embroidery and costume as Palestine's long history and position on the international trade routes exposed it to multiple influences.&lt;ref name=PCAback&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.palestinecostumearchive.org/pc_background.htm |archive-url=https://archive.is/20050630085338/http://www.palestinecostumearchive.org/pc_background.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2005-06-30 |publisher=Palestine Costume Archive |title=Palestinian costume: Background }}&lt;/ref&gt; Before the appearance of synthetically dyed threads, the colors used were determined by the materials available for the production of natural dyes: "reds" from insects and pomegranate, "dark blues" from the indigo plant: "yellow" from saffron flowers, soil and vine leaves, "brown" from oak bark, and "purple" from crushed murex shells.&lt;ref name=USAID&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usaid.gov/wbg/asalah.htm?2 |title=Palestinian Embroidery |publisher=USAID |date=September 2002 |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071024012528/http://www.usaid.gov/wbg/asalah.htm?2 |archivedate=October 24, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Shahin writes that the use of red, purple, indigo blue, and saffron reflected the ancient color schemes of the Canaanite and Philistine coast, and that Islamic green and Byzantine black were more recent additions to the traditional palette.&lt;ref name=Shahinp71&gt;Shahin, 2005, p. 71.&lt;/ref&gt; Shelagh Weir, author of Palestinian costume (1989) and Palestinian embroidery (1970), writes that cross-stitch motifs may have been derived from oriental carpets, and that couching motifs may have origins in the vestments of Christian priests or the gold thread work of Byzantium.&lt;ref name=Weirp13/&gt; Simple and stylized versions of the cypress tree (saru) motif are found throughout Palestine.&lt;ref name=PCAback/&gt;

Longstanding traditions of embroidery were found in the Upper and Lower Galilee, in the Judean Hills and on the coastal plain.&lt;ref name=Weirp13&gt;Weir, 1970, pp. 13-14.&lt;/ref&gt; Research by Weir on embroidery distribution patterns in Palestine indicates there was little history of embroidery in the area from the coast to the [[Jordan River]] that lay to the south of [[Mount Carmel]] and the [[Sea of Galilee]] and to the north of [[Jaffa]] and from [[Nablus]] to the north. Decorative elements on women's clothing in this area consisted primarily of braidwork and appliqué.&lt;ref name=PCAback/&gt; "Embroidery signifies a lack of work," an Arab proverb recorded by Gustaf Dalman in this area in 1937 has been put forward as a possible explanation for this regional variation.&lt;ref name=PCAback/&gt;

Village women embroidering in locally-distinctive styles was a tradition that was at its height in Ottoman-ruled Palestine.&lt;ref name="Chicago"/&gt; Women would sew in items to represent their heritage, ancestry, and affiliations. Motifs were derived from basic geometric forms such as squares and rosettes.&lt;ref name =PCAback/&gt; Triangles, used as amulets, were often incorporated to ward off the "evil eye", a common superstition in the Middle East. Large blocks of intricate embroidery were used on the chest panel to protect the vulnerable chest area from the evil eye, bad luck and illness.&lt;ref name=USAID/&gt; To avoid potential jinxes from other women, an imperfection was stitched in each garment to distract the focus of those looking.&lt;ref name=Chicago/&gt; 
[[File:Bethlehengirlsintraditionaldresspre1918.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Girls in [[Bethlehem]] costume pre-1918, Bonfils Portrait]]
Girls would begin producing embroidered garments, a skill generally passed to them by their grandmothers, beginning at the age of seven. Before the 20th century, most young girls were not sent to school, and much of their time outside of household chores was spent creating clothes, often for their marriage trousseau (or ''jhaz'') which included everything they would need in terms of apparel, encompassing everyday and ceremonial dresses, jewelry, veils, headdresses, undergarments, kerchiefs, belts and footwear.&lt;ref name=Chicago/&gt;&lt;ref name=Shahinp73&gt;Shahin, 2005, p. 73.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1930s, new influences introduced by European pattern books and magazines promoted the appearance of curvilinear motifs, like flowers, vines or leaf arrangements, and introduced the paired bird motif which became very popular in central Palestinian regions.&lt;ref name=PCAback/&gt; John Whitting, who put together parts of the [[MOIFA]] collection, has argued that "anything later than 1918 was not indigenous Palestinian design, but had input from foreign pattern books brought in by foreign nuns and Swiss nannies".&lt;ref name=Stillmanpix&gt;Stillman, 1979, p. ix.&lt;/ref&gt; Others say that the changes did not set in before the late 1930s, up to which time embroidery motifs local to certain villages could still be found. Geometric motifs remained popular in the Galilee and southern regions, like the Sinai Desert.&lt;ref name=PCAback/&gt;

==Men's clothing==
Some professions, such as the Jaffa boatmen, had their own unique uniforms. The horse or mule drivers (''mukaaris''), widely used between the towns in an age before proper roads, wore a short embroidered jacket with long sleeves slit open on the inside, red shoes and a small yellow woolen cap with a tight turban.&lt;ref&gt;Baldensperger. 1903. p.[https://archive.org/stream/quarterlystateme35pale#page/340/mode/2up 340].&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[1948 Palestinian exodus]] led to a disruption in traditional modes of dress and customs, as many women who had been displaced could no longer afford the time or money to invest in complex embroidered garments.&lt;ref name="Embroidering Identities"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Saca|first1=Iman|title=Embroidering Identities: A Century of Palestinian Clothing|date=2006|publisher=THE ORIENTAL INSTITUTE MUSEUM OF THE UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO|isbn=1-885923-49-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Widad Kawar]] was among the first to recognize the new styles developing after the [[1948 Palestinian exodus|Nakba]].

New styles began to appear in the 1960s. For example, the "six-branched dress" named after the six wide bands of embroidery running down from the waist.&lt;ref&gt;Weir, Shelagh (1989) ''Palestinian Costume''. British Museum. {{ISBN|0-7141-1597-5}}. p. 112.&lt;/ref&gt;  These styles came from the refugee camps, particularly after 1967. Individual village styles were lost and replaced by an identifiable "Palestinian" style.&lt;ref&gt;Skinner, Margarita (2007) ''PALESTINIAN EMBROIDERY MOTIVES. A Treasury of Stiches 1850-1950''. Melisende. {{ISBN|978-1-901764-47-5}}.  p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt;

The shawal, a style popular in the [[West Bank]] and [[Jordan]] before the [[First Intifada]], probably evolved from one of the many [[NGO|welfare]] embroidery projects in the [[Palestine refugee camps|refugee camps]]. It was a shorter and narrower fashion, with a western cut.&lt;ref&gt;Weir, Shelagh (1989) ''Palestinian Costume''. British Museum. {{ISBN|0-7141-1597-5}}. pp. 88, 113.&lt;/ref&gt;

Income generating projects in the refugee camps and in the Occupied Territories began to use embroidery motifs on non-clothing items such as accessories, bags and purses. With the evolution of the different groups distinct styles are beginning to be appear. Sulafa the UNRWA project&lt;ref&gt;http://www.unspecial.org/UNS623/UNS_623_T30.html&lt;/ref&gt; in the Gaza Strip has exhibited work at [[Museum of International Folk Art|Santa Fe]] in America. Atfaluna,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.atfaluna.net/crafts/index.php?categoryID=135&lt;/ref&gt; also from Gaza, working with deaf people, sells its products through the internet. West Bank groups include the Bethlehem Arabs Women's Union,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bethlehemwomenarabunion.org/embroidery.html&lt;/ref&gt; Surif Women's Cooperative,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tenthousandvillages.com/2701&lt;/ref&gt; Idna,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hadeel.org/index.php?main_page=manufacturers_about&amp;manufacturers_about_id=15&lt;/ref&gt; the Melkite Embroidery Project (Ramallah).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.melkitecenter.ps/&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Lebanon]] Al-Badia,&lt;ref&gt;http://almashriq.hiof.no/lebanon/300/360/362/najdeh/images/embroidery/&lt;/ref&gt; working in the Refugee Camps, is known for high quality embroidery in silk thread on dresses made of linen. The Jerusalem-based [[Fair Trade]] organisation Sunbula,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sunbula.org/&lt;/ref&gt; is working to improve the quality and presentation of items so that they can be sold in European, American and Japanese markets.

==Geography==
*[[Jerusalem]]: The Jerusalem elite followed [[Damascus]] fashions which in turn were influenced by those of the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] court in [[Istambul]]. Fabrics were imported from Syria with several specialist shops on the [[Mamilla|Mamilla Road]]. Wedding dresses were ordered from [[Aleppo]] and [[Turkey]]. From the beginning of the 20th century the upper classes began to wear European styles.&lt;ref&gt;Kawar, Widad Kamel (2011) ''Threads of Identity''. Melisende. {{ISBN|978-9963-610-41-9}}. pp. 41,177,179,191.&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Galilee]]: Collections reveal that there was a distinct Galilee women's style from at least the middle of the 19th century. The standard form was a coat (Jillayeh), tunic and trousers.&lt;ref&gt;Weir, Sheilagh (2006) ''Embroidery from Palestine''. British Museum Press. {{ISBN|978-0-7141-2573-2}}. pp. 17, 24.&lt;/ref&gt; Cross-stitch was not used much, the women preferring patchwork patterns of diamond and rectangular shapes, as well as other embroidery techniques.&lt;ref&gt;Kawal. p.287.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Skinner, Margarita (2007) ''Palestinian Embroidery Motives. A Treasury of Stitches 1850-1950''. Rimal. {{ISBN|978-1-901764-47-5}}. p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1860s, [[Henry Baker Tristram|H.B. Tristram]] described costumes in the villages of [[Al-Bassa|El Bussah]] and [[Isfia]] as being either "plain, patched or embroidered in the most fantastic and grotesque shapes".&lt;ref name=Weirp80&gt;Weir, 1989, p.80, citing  H. B. Tristram's (1865) ''The Land of Israel, a Journal of Travels in Palestine'', p. [https://archive.org/stream/landisrael00unkngoog#page/n93/mode/2up 66].&lt;/ref&gt; Towards the beginning of the 20th century Turkish/Ottoman fashions began to dominate: such as baggy trousers and cord edging.&lt;ref&gt;Weir, Sheilagh (1989) ''Palestinian Costume''. British Museum. {{ISBN|978-0-7141-1597-9}}. p. 145.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Skinner. p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Weir (2006). p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; Materials, particularly silks, were brought from Damascus.&lt;ref&gt;Kawar. p. 284.&lt;/ref&gt; Before the arrival of European colour-fast dyes the Galilee was an important area for the growing of [[Indigo dye|indago]] and [[sumac]] which were used for creating blue and red dyes.&lt;ref&gt;Kawar. p. 274.&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Nablus]]:Women's dresses from villages in the Nablus area were the least ornate in the whole of Palestine.&lt;ref&gt;Skinner.  pp 14.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Graham-Brown, Sarah (1980) ''Palestinians and their Society. 1880-1946.'' Quartet. {{ISBN|0-7043-3343-0}}. p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Tahriri work.jpg|thumb|right|Modern couching stitch from Bayt Jalla traditionally used on panels of ''malak'' wedding dress.]]
*[[Bethlehem]]: Wadad Kawar describes Bethlehem as having been "the Paris of Central Palestine".&lt;ref&gt;Kawar. p.10.&lt;/ref&gt; Both it and neighbouring [[Beit Jala|Bayt Jalla]] were known for their fine [[Couching|Couching Stitch]] work. This technique was used extensively in the panels for ''malak'' (queen) wedding dresses. The malak dress was popular amongst brides from the villages around Jerusalem. So much so that the panels began to be produced commercially in Bethlehem and Bayt Jalla. Amongst the wealthier families it was the fashion for the groom to pay for the wedding dress so the work often became a display of status.&lt;ref&gt;Gillow. p.118.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kawar. p.207.&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Ramallah]]: great variety of very distinguishable finely executed patterns.
[[File:Doll in Ramallah style dress.jpg|thumb|Doll in wedding-dress typical of Ramallah area  popular before 1948. Made by [[YWCA]] project in [[Jalazone]] RC. c. 2000.]]
*[[Lifta]] (near [[Jerusalem]]), and [[Bayt Dajan]] (near [[Jaffa]]) were known as being among the wealthiest communities in their areas, and their embroideresses among the most artistic. [http://www.saudiaramcoworld.com/issue/199101/woven.legacy.woven.language.htm]

==Garment types==

===Basic dress===
*'''[[Thawb|Thob]]''', loose fitting robe with sleeves, the actual cut of the garment varied by region.
***'''qabbeh''';  the square chest panel  of the Thob, often decorated
***'''diyal'''; brocaded back hem panel on the Bethlehem dress.
***'''shinyar''';  lower back panel of the dress, decorated in some regions
*'''Libas'''; pants,
*'''Taqsireh'''[http://www.palestineheritage.org/Taqsireh_Velvet02%20002.jpg]; short embroidered jacket worn by the women of [[Bethlehem]] on festive occasions. The gold couching of the jackets often matched the dress. Simpler jackets were used over everyday dresses. The name is derived from the Arabic verb "to shorten", (Stillmann, p.&amp;nbsp;36),
*'''Jubbeh'''; jacket, worn by men and women,
*'''Jillayeh'''; embroidered ''jubbeh'', often the embroidered outer garment of a wedding costume,
*'''Shambar'''; large veil, common to the Hebron area and southern Palestine.

===Headdress===
{{main|Palestinian keffiyeh}}
[[File:Woman wearing Keffiyeh.jpg|thumb|A woman wearing fishnet pattern keffiyeh, Paris]]
The women in each region had their distinctive headdress. The women embellished their headdresses with gold and silver coins from their bridewealth money. The more coins, the greater the wealth and prestige of the owner (Stillman, p.&amp;nbsp;38);
*'''Shaṭweh'''[http://www.ntcsites.com/palestine/clothes/view.nhtml?profile=clothes&amp;UID=10009], [http://www.palestineheritage.org/Shatwehs%206.gif], [http://www.palestineheritage.org/dec_201.gif], a distinctive conical hat,  "shaped rather like an upturned flower pot", only carried by married women. Used mainly in [[Bethlehem]], also in [[Lifta]] and [[Ayn Karim|Ain Karm]], (in the District of Jerusalem), and  [[Beit Jala]] and [[Beit Sahour|Beit Sahur]] (both near Bethlehem) (Stillman p.&amp;nbsp;37)
*'''Smadeh'''[http://www.palestineheritage.org/wpe18726.gif], used in [[Ramallah]], consists of an embroidered cap, with a stiff padded rim. A row of coins, tightly placed against another, is placed around the top of the rim. Additional coins might be sown to the upper part or attached to  narrow, embroidered bands. As with the other women's head-dresses, the ''smadeh'' represented the wearers bridal wealth, and acted as an important cash reserve. One observer wrote in 1935: "Sometimes you see a gap in the row of coins and you guess that that a doctor's bill has had to be paid, or the husband in America has failed to send money" (quoted in Stillman, p.&amp;nbsp;53.)
*'''Araqiyyeh'''[http://www.palestineheritage.org/Iraqiyyeh.gif], used in  [[Hebron]]. The words ''araqiyyeh'' and ''taqiyyeh'' have been used since the Middle Ages in the Arab world  to denote small, close-fitting head-caps, usually of cotton, which were used by both sexes. The original purpose was to absorb sweat (Arab: "araq"). In the whole of Palestine the word  ''taqiyyeh''  continued to be used about the simple scull-cap used nearest to the hair. In the Hebron area, however, the word ''araqiyyeh''  came to denote the embroidered cap with a pointed top a married woman would wear over her ''taqiyyeh''. During her engagement period a woman of the Hebron area would sow and embroider her  ''araqiyyeh'', and embellish the rim with coins from her bridal money. The first time she would wear her  ''araqiyyeh'' would be on her wedding day. (Stillman, p.&amp;nbsp;61)

The styles of [[headwear]] for men have always been an important indicator of a man's civil and religious status as well as his political affiliation: A [[turban]] being worn by a townsman and a [[kaffiyeh]] by a countryman. A white turban signifying an Islamic judge ''[[qadi]]''. In the 1790s, the Ottoman authorities instructed the Mufti of Jerusalem, Hassan al-Husayni, to put a stop to the fashion of wearing green and white turbans which they regarded as the prerogative of officially appointed judges.&lt;ref&gt;Pappe, Illan (2010) ''The Rise and Fall of a Palestinian Dynasty. The Husaynis 1700-1968''. Saqi, {{ISBN|978-0-86356-460-4}}. p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 19th century, white turbans were also worn by supporters of the [[Qays and Yaman tribes|Yaman political faction]], while the opposing [[Qais]] faction wore red.&lt;ref&gt;Weir, 1989, p. 66, citing p. 141 of C. T. Wilson (1906) ''Peasant Life in the Holy Land'', London.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1912, the [[Palestine Exploration Fund]] reported that Muslim men from Jerusalem usually wore white linen turbans, called ''shash''. In Hebron, it would be of red and yellow silk, in Nablus red and white cotton. Men in Jaffa wore white and gold turbans, similar to the style in [[Damascus]].&lt;ref&gt;Palestine Exploration Fund. Quarterly Statement for 1912. Page 11.&lt;/ref&gt; A green turban indicated a descendant of [[Muhammed]].&lt;ref&gt;Baldensperger, Philip G. (1905) ''The Immovable East''. Palestine Exploration Fund Quarterly Report. p. [https://archive.org/stream/immovableeaststu00balduoft#page/n83/mode/2up/search/green 51].&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1880 the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] style of [[tarboush]] or fez began to replace the turban amongst the [[effendi]] class.&lt;ref&gt;Weir Shelagh ''Palestinian Costume'' p. 64.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''tarboush'' had been preceded by a rounder version with blue tassel which originated from the [[Magreb]]. The arrival of the more vertical [[Young Turk]] version was emancipating for the Christian communities since it was worn by all civil and military officials regardless of religion. The exception being the [[Armenians]] who adopted a black style.&lt;ref&gt;Baldensperger, 1903,  p. [https://archive.org/stream/quarterlystateme35pale#page/342/mode/2up 342].&lt;/ref&gt;

The European styles, ''Franjy'' hat (''burneiTah''), were not adopted.&lt;ref&gt;Baldensperger, 1903,  p. [https://archive.org/stream/quarterlystateme35pale#page/64/mode/2up 65]&lt;/ref&gt;

The kaffiyeh replaced the tarbush in the 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;Kawar. p. 213.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Shoes===
Residents of the major towns, [[Jerusalem]], [[Jaffa]], [[Ramleh]], [[Lydd]], [[Hebron]], [[Gaza City|Gaza]] and [[Nablus]], wore soft white sheepskin shoes with the point in front turned up: low cut, not above the ankle, and yellow for men. Before the mid-19th century non-Muslims wore black shoes. Village men wore a higher style fastened at the front with a leather button which provided protection from thorns in the fields. Bedouin wore sandals, made by wandering shoemakers, usually Algerian Jews.  The Arabic name for sandal, ''na'l'', is identical to that used in the Bible. On special occasions Bedouin men wore long red boots with blue tassels and iron heels, ''jizmet'', which were made in Damascus.&lt;ref&gt;Baldensperger, Philip G. (1903) ''Palestine Exploration Fund Magazine''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Collections of Palestinian costumes==
Examples of Palestinian costumes and related artifacts are housed in several museums and collections, both public and private.

===Public collections===
[[File:OIMPalcost3cropped.jpg|thumb|right|Bride's wedding attire from [[Bayt Jibrin]] in an exhibition at [[Oriental Institute, Chicago]]. ]]
The following is a list of some of the public collections:
*[[British Museum]] in [[London]]. The British Museum holds over 1,000 pre-1948 items in its Palestinian costume collection. Though not on permanent display, highlights of the collection were featured in Shelagh Weir's major 1989 "Palestinian costume" exhibition. Weir's monograph remains the seminal publication on traditional Palestinian costume.
*The [[Israel Museum]] in [[Jerusalem]] holds one of the most sizable collections of Palestinian costumes. In 1986-7, the Museum held a major exhibit, "Embroideries from the Holy Land" and, in 1988, published Ziva Amir's ''The Development and Dissemination of the Chest-Panel of the Bethlehem Embroidery''. An [[art historian]], Amir traces the development of motifs (e.g., the floral vase) and the geographic spread of styles. An Israeli, Amir worked closely with Palestinian locals in Gaza and the West Bank.&lt;ref&gt;Review by Shifra Epstein in ''The Journal of American Folklore'', Vol. 104, No. 412.

'''Pottier &amp; Stymus''' was a prominent American furniture and design firm of the Victorian period.

==Company==
August Pottier, an immigrant from France, and William P. Stymus Sr. opened the company in [[New York City]] in 1859.  Their workshop was on 115 Wooster Street, and their salesroom was at 623 Broadway.&lt;ref name=antique&gt;[http://www.antiquevictorianfurniture.us/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=4&amp;Itemid=6 "Pottier &amp; Stymus Furniture"].  Antique Victorian Furniture Antiquarian Traders, 2011.  Accessed on 29 December 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; The company grew quickly, and by 1871 the firm's factory occupied a full block on Lexington Avenue.  By 1872, they employed 700 men and 50 women.  Pottier &amp; Stymus made furniture in the Neo-Greco, Renaissance Revival, Egyptian Revival, and Modern Gothic Styles.&lt;ref name=rau&gt;[http://www.rauantiques.com/library/Artists%20and%20Makers/pottier---stymus-POTTIERSTYMUSBIO.html "Pottier &amp; Stymus."] M.S. Rau Antiques.  Accessed 29 December 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;  Three drawing published in [[Harper's Magazine|Harper's New Monthly Magazine]] in November 1876 provide evidence that in addition to exclusive furniture for office buildings and rich clients, Pottier &amp; Stymus also produced simpler and cheaper furniture.&lt;ref name=antique /&gt;  Some of Pottier &amp; Stymus' work can be seen at the [[Brooklyn Museum]].

==Notable clients==

* [[Ulysses S. Grant|President Ulysses S. Grant]] - In 1869 Pottier &amp; Stymus made furniture for the President's Office and the Cabinet Room.&lt;ref name=rau /&gt;

* Railway baron [[Leland Stanford]] - His house in [[Palo Alto, California]] in 1875.
* [[Thomas Edison]] - Between 1882 and February 1884, Pottier &amp; Stymus worked on the Glenmont Estate in [[Llewellyn Park]] in [[New Jersey]].  Architect Henry Hudson Holly designed and built the house for Henry C. Pedder in 1880. Shortly thereafter, Pedder was found guilty of fraud, and the house passed into the hands of his employer, [[Arnold Constable &amp; Company]].  In 1885 just after his second marriage, [[Thomas Edison]] purchased the house for his new wife, Mina Miller.  [[Thomas Edison|Edison]] lived in the home for 45 years.  Of the original 120 pieces Pedder purchased from Pottier and Stymus about 70% remain.  In 1888, [[Thomas Edison|Edison]] commissioned Pottier &amp; Stymus to make some changes and additions to the property.  Glenmont Estate is currently a National Historical Park.&lt;ref name=park&gt;[http://www.nps.gov/edis/index.htm Thomas Edison National Historical Park]. U.S. National Park Service, updated 25 December 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

==System of documentation==
From the Golden Book of Celebrated Manufacturers and Merchants published on the occasion of the [[Centennial Exhibition]] in [[Philadelphia]], it is known that Pottier &amp; Stymus used a detailed system of documentation for their products. From the beginning of the construction process, each piece of furniture was assigned a multi-digit number, and pieces which belonged together were given sequential numbers. Few objects were clearly marked making definitive identification difficult, but when marked, Pottier &amp; Stymus used one of three methods: pencil, impressions or stencil in blank ink.&lt;ref name=antique /&gt;

She is also a licensed [[amateur radio]] operator with the [[call sign]] KE5FYE.

==Biography==

===Early life and education===
Magnus was born and raised in [[Belleville, Illinois]]. She earned degrees in [[physics]] and [[electrical engineering]] from the [[Missouri University of Science and Technology|University of Missouri–Rolla]] (now known as the Missouri University of Science and Technology) before earning a [[PhD]] in [[Materials science|materials science and engineering]] from the [[Georgia Institute of Technology]] in 1996.  Research for her [[dissertation]], entitled "An Investigation of the relationship between the [[thermochemistry]] and [[Thermionic emission|emission]] behavior of [[thermionic cathode]]s based on the BaO-Sc&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-WO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; ternary system," was supported by a fellowship from the [[Glenn Research Center|NASA Lewis Research Center]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://smartech.gatech.edu/handle/1853/19625 |first=Sandra |last=Magnus  |title=An Investigation of the relationship between the thermochemistry and emission behavior of thermionic cathodes based on the BaO-Sc&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-WO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; ternary system |accessdate=2008-11-16 |work=SMARTech |publisher=Georgia Institute of Technology |date=May 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="JSCbio" /&gt;

===Engineering career===
During the 1980s, Magnus worked on [[stealth aircraft]] design as an [[engineer]] for [[McDonnell Douglas]].  She worked on the propulsion system for the [[A-12 Avenger II]] until the project was canceled by the [[United States Navy|Navy]] in 1991.&lt;ref name="JSCbio" /&gt;

===NASA career===
[[File:Sandy Magnus in the Destiny Module.jpg|left|thumb|Sandra Magnus, STS-119 mission specialist, exercises on the Cycle Ergometer with Vibration Isolation System (CEVIS) in the Destiny laboratory.]]

====STS-112====
Magnus was selected as an astronaut candidate in 1996 and flew her first space mission, [[STS-112]], in October 2002 as a mission specialist. The main objective of [[Space Shuttle Atlantis|Space Shuttle ''Atlantis'']]' mission was the installation of the S1 truss section on the [[International Space Station]] (ISS) and consumables delivery. Magnus operated the space station's robotic arm during the three spacewalks required to install and activate the S1 truss. The flight duration was 10 days 19 hours 58 minutes and 44 seconds.

====Survival training====
From January 29–31, 2006, together with Oleg Artemiev and [[Michael Barratt (astronaut)|Michael Barratt]], Magnus took part in a two-day examination for the ability to survive in an uninhabited area in case of the [[Soyuz (spacecraft)#Reentry Module|Soyuz descent module]] making an emergency landing. She passed this examination in the forest near [[Moscow]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://suzymchale.com/ruspace/cosnews2006.html|title=Future cosmonauts learn to survive in freezing weather in the Moscow forests|author=|publisher=RuSpace|date=January 27, 2006|accessdate=April 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====NEEMO 11====
From September 16–22, 2006, Magnus served as the commander of NASA's [[NEEMO#NEEMO 11: September 16–22, 2006|NEEMO 11]] mission, an undersea expedition at the [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]]'s [[Aquarius (laboratory)|Aquarius laboratory]] located off the coast of [[Florida]].  With fellow astronaut/[[aquanaut]]s [[Timothy Kopra]], [[Robert Behnken]] and [[Timothy Creamer]], all of whom were training for possible assignment to missions to the International Space Station, Magnus imitated [[Moon landing|moonwalk]]s, tested concepts for mobility using various [[spacesuit]] configurations and weights to simulate lunar [[gravity]].  Techniques for communication, navigation, geological sample retrieval, construction and using remote-controlled [[robot]]s on the [[moon]]'s surface also were tested.  [[National Undersea Research Center]] support crew members Larry Ward and Roger Garcia provided [[engineering]] support inside the [[Underwater habitat|habitat]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/NEEMO/NEEMO11/index.html|title=NASA - NEEMO 11|author=NASA|publisher=NASA|date=May 11, 2010|accessdate=September 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Expedition 18====
Magnus served as Flight Engineer on board the International Space Station as part of [[Expedition 18]].&lt;ref name="JSCbio"/&gt; Magnus was a Mission Specialist on [[STS-126]] for the trip to the station, which launched on November 14, 2008.&lt;ref name="sched"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.nasa.gov/missions/highlights/schedule.html |title=NASA's Shuttle and Rocket Missions |accessdate=2008-11-16 |date=2008-11-14 |publisher=NASA}}&lt;/ref&gt; She served as Mission Specialist on [[STS-119]] when it returned on March 28, 2009.&lt;ref name="JSCbio"/&gt;&lt;ref name="gt"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gatech.edu/newsroom/release.html?id=19 |title=Cleared for Takeoff: Georgia Tech Graduate is Crewmember on Shuttle Mission to ISS |date=2002-08-06 |accessdate=2008-11-14 |work=News Room |publisher=[[Georgia Institute of Technology]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110520081117/http://www.gatech.edu/newsroom/release.html?id=19 |archivedate=2011-05-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; She logged 133 days in orbit and received warm greetings from NASA on her return. Her replacement, [[JAXA]] astronaut [[Koichi Wakata]], was launched aboard ''Discovery'' on March 15, 2009.&lt;ref name="return" /&gt;

====STS-135====
[[File:STS-135 Sandy Magnus in the Cupola.jpg|right|thumb|Magnus in the [[Cupola (ISS module)|Cupola]] aboard the International Space Station during STS-135.]]
On September 14, 2010, NASA announced Magnus to be one of four astronauts assigned to the STS-135 "launch on need" crew that was, if needed, to fly a rescue mission for [[STS-134]], which was originally the last scheduled shuttle flight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/home/hqnews/2010/sep/HQ_10-222_LON_Annc.html|title=NASA Assigns Crew for Final Launch on Need Shuttle Mission |author=NASA|date=September 14, 2010|accessdate=September 14, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other members assigned to that crew were commander [[Christopher Ferguson]], pilot [[Douglas G. Hurley]], and fellow mission specialist [[Rex J. Walheim]]. In January 2011, NASA added [[STS-135]] to the manifest as the final space shuttle mission, scheduled to launch in July 2011; STS-134 was conducted successfully in May 2011, requiring no rescue flight. The mission launched successfully on 8 July 2011 and landed on July 21.

===AIAA===
Dr. Magnus left NASA Astronaut corps to become the Executive Director of the [[American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics]] (AIAA) .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aiaa.org/SecondaryTwoColumn.aspx?id=13857 |title=AIAA Announces Sandra H.

'''''Shada''''' is an unaired serial of the British [[science fiction television]] series ''[[Doctor Who]]''. It was intended as the final serial of the 1979–80 season ([[Doctor Who (season 17)|season 17]]) but was never completed, owing to [[strike action]] at the [[BBC]] during filming.

The BBC released a completed version of ''Shada'' in 2017, with missing dialogue newly recorded by the original cast, using the same audio equipment employed in the initial shoot, and animated by the team that undertook the animated version of the 1966 serial ''[[The Power of the Daleks]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2017-10-10/doctor-who-shada-tom-baker/#r3z-addoor|title=BBC regenerates ‘lost’ Tom Baker Doctor Who story Shada|publisher=''Radio Times''|date= |accessdate=11 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B0767QDR9X/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1|title=Doctor Who Shada|date=25 November 2017|website=Amazon.co.uk|accessdate=25 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Previous attempts to present the story include a narrated reconstruction for [[2 Entertain|BBC Video]]; a re-imagined [[radio drama|audio play]] by [[Big Finish Productions]], also offered with basic [[Adobe Flash|Flash]] imagery on [[BBC Red Button|BBCi]] and the BBC Doctor Who website; and a novelisation by [[Gareth Roberts (writer)|Gareth Roberts]], based on the latest shooting scripts, with the author's own additions.&lt;ref name="Southall" /&gt;

==Synopsis==
&lt;!--The plot summary shouldn't be longer than 400 words - current word count 311. DO NOT add further details to this plot summary; only amend sentences if need correcting, and please adhere to MS:TVPLOT.--&gt;

The Doctor answers a distress signal from Professor Chronotis, a Time Lord posing as a professor at [[St. Cedd's College, Cambridge]] who loaned a Gallifreyan tome to his student Chris Parsons. The Doctor retrieves the book while Chronotis dies after his mind was extracted by the sphere of a mad scientist named Skagra, living long enough to warn Romana, Parsons, and K9 of them and Shada. The Doctor locates Skagra's cloaked spacecraft, only for his companions to be captured while Skagra has his sphere extract the Doctor's mind to decode the book before taking Romana in the TARDIS to his carrier ship and Krarg creations. But the Doctor survived his ordeal with his mind intact and has ship's computer release Chris and K9 and take them to a space station Skagra previously occupied. The group find Skagra's discarded colleagues and learn he is after a Time Lord named Salyavin.

Back on Earth, Clare Keightley accidentally revives Chronotis whose chambers are revealed as a TARDIS, the Professor explaining the book is a key to the prison planet Shada where Salyavin is held. Chronotis and Clare repair the TARDIS to reach Skagra's carrier, saving the Doctor and Chris after Skagra decoded the book and reveals his intent to absorb Salyavin's mind and use its telepathy to unite all life into a single Universal Mind. The group reach Shada as Skagra releases the prisoners, Chronotis revealed as Salyavin with Skagra extracting his mind and turning the prisoners and Chris into his thralls. Reminded that the Universal Mind contains a copy of his brain, the Doctor builds a telepathy helmet to wrestle control from Skagra while the Krarg are destroyed. Skagra ends up a prisoner in his own ship while the Doctor returns the restored prisoners to Shada and parts ways with Chronotis, musing over Chronotis' exploits being exaggerated while expecting a similar treatment within two centuries.

==Production==
Originally, writer [[Douglas Adams]] presented a wholly different idea for the season's six-part finale, involving the Doctor's retirement from adventuring. Facing resistance from producer [[Graham Williams (television producer)|Graham Williams]], Adams chose to avoid work on a replacement, under the expectation that time pressures would eventually force the producer's hand and allow his idea to be used. Ultimately, however, Williams forced Adams to conceive a new story as a last-minute replacement, which became ''Shada''.

Under its original remit, Graham Williams intended the story as a discussion about the death penalty, specifically how a civilisation like the Time Lords would deal with the issue, and treat its prisoners.&lt;ref name=shannonsullivan&gt;
{{cite web
|url= http://www.shannonsullivan.com/drwho/serials/5m.html
|title= Shada
|publisher = A Brief History of Time Travel
|last = Sullivan
|first = Shannon
|date = 7 August 2007
|accessdate = 27 March 2013
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

As composed by Adams, the story was scheduled to span six 25-minute episodes. Location filming in [[Cambridge]] and the first of three studio sessions at [[BBC Television Centre]] were completed as scheduled;&lt;ref name="Southall" /&gt; however, when the scheduled second studio block was due to start, it fell foul of a long-running technicians' dispute at the BBC.&lt;ref name="Dicks" /&gt; The strike was over by the onset of rehearsals for the third recording session, but ultimately the studio time was redirected to other higher-priority Christmas programming, leaving the serial incomplete.&lt;ref name="Ley" /&gt; 

Following the departure of Graham Williams from the producer role, attempts were made by new producer [[John Nathan-Turner]] to remount the story; for various reasons, however, this never transpired. Consequently, in June 1980, the production was formally dropped. It is estimated that only 50% of the story was filmed.&lt;ref name="Southall" /&gt;

After the production halt, Adams expressed a low opinion of the script and was content to let it remain obscure, turning down offers to adapt the story in various forms. He once claimed that when he had signed the contract allowing the script's 1992 release (accompanying the serial's [[VHS]] reconstruction), it had been amongst a pile of papers sent over by his agent, and that he was unaware of what he was agreeing to.&lt;ref name="Simpson" /&gt;

In 1983, clips from ''Shada'' were used in ''[[The Five Doctors]]'', the 20th-anniversary special. [[Tom Baker]], the fourth actor to play the Doctor, had declined to appear in the special, and the plot was reworked to explain the events in the clips.&lt;ref name="Dicks" /&gt;

===Cast notes===
[[Denis Carey (actor)|Denis Carey]] was subsequently cast as the [[eponymous]] Keeper in Tom Baker's penultimate story, ''[[The Keeper of Traken]]'' (1981), and also appeared as the Borad's [[Avatar (computing)|avatar]] in ''[[Timelash]]'' (1985).

==Reconstruction==

===1992 VHS reconstruction===
A decade after the serial's abandonment, John Nathan-Turner set out to complete the story in a fashion, by commissioning new effects shots and a score, and having Tom Baker record linking material to cover the missing scenes. The resulting shortened episodes (of between 14 and 22 minutes each) received a 111-minute VHS release in 1992. In its UK edition, the VHS was accompanied by a facsimile of a version of Douglas Adams's script.&lt;ref name="Southall" /&gt; The release was discontinued in the UK in 1996.

This VHS reconstruction, the 2003 [[BBC Red Button|BBCi]]/Big Finish adaptation and the 1994&lt;!-- Please note "Thirty Years in the Tardis" aired in 1993, then new material was added to that documentary and it became "More Than Thirty Years in the Tardis" which was released in 1994, so the number here is correct --&gt; documentary ''More Than Thirty Years in the TARDIS'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.doctorwhonews.net/2012/05/dwn030512103008-dvd-update-summer.html |title=DVD Update: Summer Schedule |publisher=Doctor Who News |date= |accessdate=9 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;, were re-released together on DVD on 7 January 2013, as ''The Legacy Collection'' (UK) or simply ''Shada'' (North America).

===2017 animated restoration===
On 24 November 2017, an effort to complete the serial officially, using newly recorded dialogue from the original cast (using the serial's original recording engineer and audio equipment), and new animated footage to complete the missing segments, was released as a digital download; DVD and Blu-ray releases followed on 4 December 2017 in Region 2.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Cameron |last=McEwan |url=http://www.doctorwho.tv/whats-new/article/unfinished-fourth-doctor-classic-shada-to-be-finally-completed |title=Unfinished Fourth Doctor Classic 'Shada' To Be Finally Completed!|publisher=Doctor Who |date=10 October 2017 |accessdate=10 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new sequences were animated by the same team that undertook the 2016 animated edition of the 1966 serial ''[[The Power of the Daleks]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2017-10-10/doctor-who-shada-tom-baker/#r3z-addoor|title=BBC regenerates ‘lost’ Tom Baker Doctor Who story Shada|publisher=''Radio Times''|date= |accessdate=11 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; including director Charles Norton, with lead character art by Martin Geraghty, character shading by Adrian Salmon, props by Mike Collins, and background art by Daryl Joyce.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Guerrier |first1=Simon |title="Story Preview: The Power of the Daleks" |issue=505 |publisher=Doctor Who Magazine |date=December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This version received its U.S. broadcast debut 19 July 2018, on [[BBC America]], with guide data giving the episode title as "The Lost Episode" rather than "Shada".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/tv/la-et-st-tvhighlights-20180719-story.html |title=Thursday's TV highlights: 'Doctor Who: The Lost Episode' on BBC America |last=Stockly |first=Ed |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=18 July 2018 |access-date=20 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Big Finish audio play and web animation (2003)===
In 2003, the BBC commissioned [[Big Finish Productions]] to remake ''Shada'' as an audio play which was then webcast&lt;ref name="Southall" /&gt;&lt;ref name="bbcwebcasts" /&gt; in six episodic segments, accompanied by limited [[Adobe Flash|Flash]] animation, on the [[bbc.co.uk|BBC website]] using illustrations provided by comic strip artist [[Lee Sullivan]].&lt;ref name="LeeSullivan" /&gt; The play starred [[Paul McGann]] as the [[Eighth Doctor]] and [[Lalla Ward]] as Romana. The audio play was also broadcast on digital radio station [[BBC Radio 4 Extra|BBC7]], on 10 December 2005 (as a 2{{1/2}}-hour omnibus), and was repeated in six parts as the opening story to the Eighth Doctor's summer season, which began on 16 July 2006.

The webcast version (originally broadcast via BBCi's "Red Button") remains available from the BBC ''Doctor Who'' "classic series" website, and an expanded audio-only version is available for purchase on CD from Big Finish. This expanded version was the one broadcast on BBC7.

====Production====
Tom Baker was originally approached to reprise the role of the Doctor, but declined. The Eighth Doctor was then substituted and the story reworked accordingly.

Portions of the Big Finish version were reworked by [[Gary Russell]] to make the story fit into ''Doctor Who'' continuity. This included a new introduction, and a new explanation for the Fourth Doctor and Romana being "taken out of time" during the events of ''The Five Doctors''; the [[Eighth Doctor]] has come to collect Romana and K9 because he has begun to have a feeling that there was something they should have done at that time.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

When Skagra is investigating the Doctor, clips from three other Big Finish productions can be heard, exclusively on the CD version – ''[[The Fires of Vulcan]]'', ''[[The Marian Conspiracy]]'' and ''[[Phantasmagoria (Doctor Who audio)|Phantasmagoria]]''. The original serial was to have used clips from ''[[The Pirate Planet]]'' (1978), ''[[The Power of Kroll]]'' (1978–79), ''[[The Creature from the Pit]]'' (1979), ''[[The Androids of Tara]]'' (1978), ''[[Destiny of the Daleks]]'' (1979), and ''[[City of Death]]'' (1979).{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

====Outside references====
In Episode 2 of the webcast version, when Chris is in his lab showing Clare the book, a vending machine-like object in the background is labelled "Nutrimat", a reference to a similar device in Adams' ''[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy]]''. Two other references are a sequence where Skagra steals a [[Ford Prefect (car)|Ford Prefect]] and when images of ''Hitchhiker's Guide'' characters appear as inmates on Shada itself.

===Ian Levine animated version (2011)===
In 2010, [[Ian Levine]] funded an unofficial project to complete the original ''Shada'' story using animation and the original voice actors, minus Tom Baker and David Brierley, to complete the parts of the story that were never filmed. [[John Leeson]] would replace Brierley as the voice of K9, and Paul Jones (better known as a studio carpenter)&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb name |id=nm2458850 |name=Paul Jones (XXVI)}}&lt;/ref&gt; would replace Tom Baker as the Doctor.&lt;ref name="Southall" /&gt; The completed story was finished in late 2011 and announced by Levine, via his Twitter account, on 8 September 2011.&lt;ref name="Southall" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Burk" /&gt; J. R. Southall, writer for the science fiction magazine ''[[Starburst (magazine)|Starburst]]'', reviewed Levine's completed version and scored it 10 out of 10 in an article published on 15 September 2011.&lt;ref name="Southallreview" /&gt; The completed Levine version appeared on torrent sites over two years later, on 12 October 2013.

===Novelisation and audio book (2012)===
{{Infobox book

}}

Elements of the story were reused by Douglas Adams for his novel ''[[Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency]]'', in particular the character of Professor Chronotis who possesses a time machine. Adams did not allow ''Shada'', or any of his other ''Doctor Who'' stories, to be novelised by [[Target Books]]. It is, therefore, one of only five serials from the 1963–1989 series not to be novelised by Target – along with Adams' other stories ''[[The Pirate Planet]]'' and ''[[City of Death]]'', plus [[Eric Saward]]'s two [[Dalek]] stories (''[[Resurrection of the Daleks]]'' and ''[[Revelation of the Daleks]]'').

A six-part adaptation of the story by Jonathan V Way appeared in issues 13–18 of ''Cosmic Masque'', the [[Doctor Who Appreciation Society]]'s fiction magazine. Adams granted permission for the adaptation on condition that it was never published in collected form.&lt;ref name="Foster" /&gt;

[[BBC Books]] published a novelisation of this serial on 15 March 2012, written by [[Gareth Roberts (writer)|Gareth Roberts]]. Roberts drew on the latest versions of the scripts available, as well as adding new material of his own to "fix" various plotholes and unanswered questions.&lt;ref name="Berriman" /&gt; [[Nicholas Pegg]], in his review of the book for ''[[Doctor Who Magazine]]'' heartily praised it, calling it a "successful duet".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|last=Pegg|first=Nicholas|date=4 April 2012|title=The DWM Review: Shada|magazine=[[Doctor Who Magazine]]|publisher=[[Panini Comics]]|location=Royal Tunbridge Wells, Kent|issue=445|pages=72–73}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Audio book====
Lalla Ward delivered an 11hr 30min unabridged reading of the Gareth Roberts novelisation for [[AudioGo]]; joining her, voicing K9, was John Leeson. The audio recording was released on 15 March 2012, and is available for download or on 10 CDs (CD {{ISBN|978-1-4458-6763-2}}, Download {{ISBN|9781445867656}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.audiogo.com/doctor-who-shada |title=Doctor Who: Shada Audiobook on Audio CD, Audio Download, buy now from |publisher=AudioGO |date= |accessdate=9 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Vanessa Bishop reviewed it favourably for ''Doctor Who Magazine'', singling out Simon E Power's sound design for special praise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|last=Bishop|first=Vanessa|date=30 May 2012|title=The DWM Review: Shada|magazine=[[Doctor Who Magazine]]|publisher=[[Panini Comics]]|location=Royal Tunbridge Wells, Kent|issue=447|pages=72–73}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reviews==
[[Paul Cornell]], [[Martin Day]], and [[Keith Topping]] gave the serial (at the time in the form of the 1992 VHS reconstruction) a mixed review in ''[[The Discontinuity Guide]]'' (1995), saying; {{cquote|'I dunno, nowadays they'll publish anything.' Infamous because it was never completed, it was for a long time stated that 'Shada' would have been the highlight of the seventeenth season. What was filmed doesn't quite encourage such optimism. It's a very cheap looking story, and there are lashings of bad puns and dull comedy, including three takes on the 'One lump or two?/Sugar?' joke. Against that, the basic plot is interesting – almost justifying its six episodes, which is rare – and the Cambridge scenes, though stilted, are well executed. It's hugely flawed, but it's a shame that this one was clobbered by a strike and '[[The Creature from the Pit]]' wasn't.&lt;ref name=Discontinuity /&gt;}}

Patrick Mulkern reviewed the 2017 partially reconstructed version for ''[[Radio Times]]''.  Mulkern thought that despite "pockets of magic to enjoy" it was a "sprawling but far-from-epic serial." The humour was repetitive and fell flat and the action pedestrian.  Mulkern recommended Gareth Roberts' novelisation as a superior alternative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Mulkern |first1=Patrick |title=Tom Baker returns in Shada but is this lost Doctor Who still a plodder? |url=https://www.radiotimes.com/news/2018-07-25/tom-baker-returns-in-shada-but-is-this-lost-doctor-who-still-a-plodder/ |publisher=''[[Radio Times]]'' |date=24 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Shepley Bulfinch''' (Shepley Bulfinch Richardson &amp; Abbott Inc.) is an international architecture, planning, and interior design firm with offices in Boston, Houston, and Phoenix. It is one of the oldest architecture firms in continuous practice in the United States&lt;ref&gt;Almanac of Architecture &amp; Design 2015, pp. 282-283&lt;/ref&gt; and was recognized by The [[American Institute of Architects]] with its highest honor, the AIA Architecture Firm Award, in 1973.

It is the successor firm to the architecture practice formed in Boston in 1874 by American architect [[Henry Hobson Richardson]]. Following Richardson's death in 1886, the firm existed as [[Shepley, Rutan and Coolidge]] through 1915, then became '''Coolidge and Shattuck''' from 1915 through 1924, '''Coolidge Shepley Bulfinch and Abbott''' from 1924 through 1952, and '''Shepley Bulfinch Richardson and Abbott''' from 1952. In 2009 Shepley Bulfinch acquired merzproject, a small design studio located in Phoenix, Arizona, that is now the firm's Phoenix office. In 2015, the firm acquired Bailey Architects of Houston as its third office.

In [[mathematics]], [[physics]] and [[chemistry]], a '''space group''' is the [[symmetry group]] of a configuration in space, usually in [[three dimensions]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Hiller, Howard|title=Crystallography and cohomology of groups|journal=Amer. Math. Monthly|volume=93|issue=10|year=1986|pages=765–779|url=http://www.maa.org/programs/maa-awards/writing-awards/crystallography-and-cohomology-of-groups|doi=10.2307/2322930|jstor=2322930}}&lt;/ref&gt; In three dimensions, there are 219 distinct types, or 230 if [[Chirality (mathematics)|chiral]] copies are considered distinct. Space groups are also studied in dimensions other than 3 where they are sometimes called '''[[Ludwig Bieberbach|Bieberbach]] groups''', and are discrete [[Cocompact group action|cocompact]]  [[group (mathematics)|group]]s of isometries of an oriented Euclidean space.

In [[crystallography]], space groups are also called the '''crystallographic''' or '''[[Evgraf Fedorov|Fedorov]] groups''', and represent a description of the [[symmetry]] of the crystal. A definitive source regarding 3-dimensional space groups is the ''International Tables for Crystallography'' ({{harvtxt|Hahn|2002}}).

==History==
Space groups in 2 dimensions are the 17 [[wallpaper group]]s which have been known for several centuries, though the proof that the list was complete was only given in 1891, after the much harder case of space groups had been done.

In 1879 [[Leonhard Sohncke]] listed the 65 space groups (called Sohncke groups) whose elements preserve the orientation. More accurately, he listed 66 groups, but Fedorov and Schönflies both noticed that two of them were really the same. The space groups in 3 dimensions were first enumerated by {{harvs|txt|authorlink=Evgraf Fedorov|last=Fedorov|year=1891}} (whose list had 2 omissions (I{{overline|4}}3d and Fdd2) and one duplication (Fmm2)), and shortly afterwards were independently enumerated by {{harvs|txt|authorlink=Arthur Moritz Schönflies|last=Schönflies|year=1891}} (whose list had 4 omissions (I{{overline|4}}3d, Pc, Cc, ?) and one duplication (P{{overline|4}}2&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;m)). The correct list of 230 space groups was found by 1892 during correspondence between Fedorov and Schönflies. {{harvs|txt|authorlink=William Barlow (geologist)|last=Barlow|year=1894}} later enumerated the groups with a different method, but omitted four groups (Fdd2, I{{overline|4}}2d, P{{overline|4}}2&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;d, and P{{overline|4}}2&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;c) even though he already had the correct list of 230 groups from Fedorov and Schönflies; the common claim that Barlow was unaware of their work is a myth.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}
{{harvtxt|Burckhardt|1967}} describes the history of the discovery of the space groups in detail.

==Elements==
The space groups in three dimensions are made from combinations of the 32 [[crystallographic point group]]s with the 14 [[Bravais lattice]]s, each of the latter belonging to one of 7 [[lattice system]]s.  This results in a space group being some combination of the translational symmetry of a [[unit cell]] including lattice centering, the point group symmetry operations of [[Reflection (mathematics)|reflection]], [[rotation]] and [[improper rotation]] (also called rotoinversion), and the [[screw axis]] and [[glide plane]] symmetry operations.  The combination of all these symmetry operations results in a total of 230 different space groups describing all possible crystal symmetries.

===Elements fixing a point===
The elements of the space group fixing a point of space are the identity element, reflections, rotations and [[improper rotation]]s.

===Translations===
The translations form a normal abelian subgroup of rank 3, called the Bravais lattice. There are 14 possible types of Bravais lattice. The [[Quotient (group theory)|quotient]] of the space group by the Bravais lattice is a finite group which is one of the 32 possible [[point group]]s. Translation is defined as the face moves from one point to another point.

===Glide planes===
A [[glide plane]] is a reflection in a plane, followed by a translation parallel with that plane. This is noted by ''a'', ''b'' or ''c'', depending on which axis the glide is along.  There is also the ''n'' glide, which is a glide along the half of a diagonal of a face, and the ''d'' glide, which is a fourth of the way along either a face or space diagonal of the unit cell. The latter is called the diamond glide plane as it features in the [[diamond]] structure. In 17 space groups, due to the centering of the cell, the glides occur in two perpendicular directions simultaneously, ''i.e.'' the same glide plane can be called ''b'' or ''c'', ''a'' or ''b'', ''a'' or ''c''. For example, group Abm2 could be also called Acm2, group Ccca could be called Cccb. In 1992, it was suggested to use symbol ''e'' for such planes. The symbols for five space groups have been modified:
{| class="wikitable"
! Space group No. !! 39 !! 41 !! 64 !! 67 !! 68
|-
! New symbol
| Aem2 || Aea2|| Cmce|| Cmme|| Ccce
|-
! Old Symbol
| Abm2|| Aba2|| Cmca|| Cmma|| Ccca
|}

===Screw axes===
A [[screw axis]] is a rotation about an axis, followed by a translation along the direction of the axis.  These are noted by a number, ''n'', to describe the degree of rotation, where the number is how many operations must be applied to complete a full rotation (e.g., 3 would mean a rotation one third of the way around the axis each time).  The degree of translation is then added as a subscript showing how far along the axis the translation is, as a portion of the parallel lattice vector.  So, 2&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is a twofold rotation followed by a translation of 1/2 of the lattice vector.

=== General formula ===
The general formula for the action of an element of a space group is

''y'' = ''M''.''x'' + ''D''

where ''M'' is its matrix, ''D'' is its vector, and where the element transforms point ''x'' into point ''y''. In general, ''D'' = ''D''([[lattice (group)|lattice]]) + ''D''(''M''), where ''D''(''M'') is a unique function of ''M'' that is zero for ''M'' being the identity. The matrices ''M'' form a [[point group]] that is a basis of the space group; the lattice must be symmetric under that point group.

The lattice dimension can be less than the overall dimension, resulting in a "subperiodic" space group. For (overall dimension, lattice dimension):
* (1,1): One-dimensional [[line group]]s
* (2,1): Two-dimensional [[line group]]s: [[frieze group]]s
* (2,2): [[Wallpaper group]]s
* (3,1): Three-dimensional [[line group]]s; with the 3D crystallographic point groups, the [[rod group]]s
* (3,2): [[Layer group]]s
* (3,3): The space groups discussed in this article

==Notation==
{{further|List of space groups}}
There are at least ten methods of naming space groups.  Some of these methods can assign several different names to the same space group, so altogether there are many thousands of different names.

*'''Number'''. The International Union of Crystallography publishes tables of all space group types, and assigns each a unique number from 1 to 230.  The numbering is arbitrary, except that groups with the same crystal system or point group are given consecutive numbers.
*'''International symbol''' or '''[[Hermann–Mauguin notation]]'''. The Hermann–Mauguin (or international) notation describes the lattice and some generators for the group. It has a shortened form called the '''international short symbol''', which is the one most commonly used in crystallography, and usually consists of a set of four symbols.  The first describes the centering of the Bravais lattice (''P'', ''A'', ''B'', ''C'', ''I'', ''R'' or ''F'').  The next three describe the most prominent symmetry operation visible when projected along one of the high symmetry directions of the crystal. These symbols are the same as used in [[point group]]s, with the addition of glide planes and screw axis, described above.  By way of example, the space group of [[quartz]] is P3&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;21, showing that it exhibits primitive centering of the motif (i.e., once per unit cell), with a threefold screw axis and a twofold rotation axis.  Note that it does not explicitly contain the [[crystal system]], although this is unique to each space group (in the case of ''P''3&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;21, it is trigonal).

:In the international short symbol the first symbol (3&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; in this example) denotes the symmetry along the major axis (c-axis in trigonal cases), the second (2 in this case) along axes of secondary importance (a and b) and the third symbol the symmetry in another direction. In the trigonal case there also exists a space group P3&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;12. In this space group the twofold axes are not along the a and b-axes but in a direction rotated by 30°.

:The international symbols and international short symbols for some of the space groups were changed slightly between 1935 and 2002, so several space groups have 4 different international symbols in use.

*'''Hall notation'''[http://cci.lbl.gov/sginfo/hall_symbols.html]. Space group notation with an explicit origin. Rotation, translation and axis-direction symbols are clearly separated and inversion centers are explicitly defined. The construction and format of the notation make it particularly suited to computer generation of symmetry information. For example, group number 3 has three Hall symbols: P 2y (P 1 2 1), P 2 (P 1 1 2), P 2x (P 2 1 1).
*'''[[Schönflies notation#Space groups|Schönflies notation]]'''. The space groups with given point group are numbered  by 1, 2, 3, ...  (in the same order as their international number) and this number is added as a superscript to the Schönflies symbol for the point group. For example, groups numbers 3 to 5 whose point group is ''C''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; have Schönflies symbols ''C''{{sup sub|1|2}}, ''C''{{sup sub|2|2}}, ''C''{{sup sub|3|2}}.
*'''[[Evgraf Fedorov|Fedorov]] notation'''
*'''Shubnikov symbol'''
*'''Strukturbericht designation''' is related notation for crystal structures given a letter and index: '''A''' Elements (monatomic), '''B''' for AB compounds, '''C''' for AB&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; compounds, '''D''' for A&lt;sub&gt;m &lt;/sub&gt;B&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; compounds, ('''E''', '''F''', …, '''K''' More complex compounds), '''L''' Alloys, '''O''' Organic compounds, '''S''' Silicates. Some structure designation share the same space groups. For example, space group 225 is A&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, B&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, and C&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;. Space group 221 is A&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;, and B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Strukturbericht|title=Strukturbericht - Wikimedia Commons|website=commons.wikimedia.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, crystallographers would not use Strukturbericht notation to describe the space group, rather it would be used to describe a specific crystal structure (e.g. space group + atomic arrangement (motif)).
* 2D:'''[[Orbifold notation]]''' and 3D:[[Fibrifold notation]]. As the name suggests, the orbifold notation describes the orbifold, given by the quotient of Euclidean space by the space group, rather than generators of the space group. It was introduced by [[John Horton Conway|Conway]] and [[William Thurston|Thurston]], and is not used much outside mathematics. Some of the space groups have several different fibrifolds associated to them, so have several different fibrifold symbols.
*'''[[Coxeter notation]]''' – Spatial and point symmetry groups, represented as modications of the pure reflectional [[Coxeter group]]s.
* [[Geometric notation]]&lt;ref&gt;[[PDF]] [http://geocalc.clas.asu.edu/pdf/CrystalGA.pdf The Crystallographic Space Groups in Geometric Algebra], David Hestenes and Jeremy Holt&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[Geometric algebra]] notation.

==Classification systems==
There are (at least) 10 different ways to classify space groups into classes. The relations between  some of  these are described in the following table. Each classification system is a refinement of the ones below it.

{|class=wikitable
|colspan=2|'''(Crystallographic) space group types''' (230 in three dimensions). Two space groups, considered as subgroups of the group of affine transformations of space, have the same space group type if they are conjugate by an  orientation-preserving affine transformation. In three dimensions, for 11 of the [[affine space]] groups, there is no orientation-preserving map from the group to its mirror image, so if one distinguishes groups from their mirror images these each split into two cases. So there are 54&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;11&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;65 space group types that preserve orientation.
|-
|colspan=2|'''Affine space group types''' (219 in three dimensions). Two space groups, considered as subgroups of the group of affine transformations of space, have the same affine space group type if they are conjugate under an affine transformation. The affine space group type is determined by the underlying abstract group of the space group. In three dimensions there are 54 affine space group types that preserve orientation.
|-
|colspan=2|'''Arithmetic crystal classes''' (73 in three dimensions). Sometimes called Z-classes. These are determined by the point group together with the action of the point group on the subgroup of translations.  In other words, the arithmetic crystal classes correspond to conjugacy classes of finite subgroup of the general linear group GL&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;('''Z''') over the integers.  A space group is called '''symmorphic''' (or '''split''')  if there is a point such that all symmetries are the product of a symmetry fixing this point and a translation. Equivalently, a space group is symmorphic if it is a [[semidirect product]] of its point group with its translation subgroup. There are 73 symmorphic space groups, with exactly one in each arithmetic crystal class. There are also 157 nonsymmorphic space group types with varying numbers in the arithmetic crystal classes.

Arithmetic crystal classes may be interpreted as different orientations of the point groups in the lattice, with the group elements' matrix components being constrained to have integer coefficients in lattice space. This is rather easy to picture in the two-dimensional, [[wallpaper group]] case. Some of the point groups have reflections, and the reflection lines can be along the lattice directions, halfway in between them, or both.
* None: C&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;: p1; C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;: p2; C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;: p3; C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;: p4; C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;: p6
* Along: D&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;: pm, pg; D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;: pmm, pmg, pgg; D&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;: p31m
* Between: D&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;: cm; D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;: cmm; D&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;: p3m1
* Both: D&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;: p4m, p4g; D&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;: p6m
|-
|'''(geometric) [[Crystal classes]]''' (32 in three dimensions). Sometimes called Q-classes. The crystal class of a space group is determined by its point group: the quotient by the subgroup of translations, acting on the lattice. Two space groups are in the same crystal class if and only if their point groups, which are subgroups of GL&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;('''Z'''), are conjugate in the larger group GL&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;('''Q''').
|'''Bravais flocks''' (14 in three dimensions). These are determined by the underlying Bravais lattice type. 
These correspond to conjugacy classes of  lattice point groups in GL&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;('''Z'''), where the lattice point group is the group of symmetries of the underlying lattice that fix a point of the lattice, and contains the point group.
|-
|'''[[Crystal systems]]'''. (7 in three dimensions) Crystal systems are an ad hoc modification of the lattice systems to make them compatible with the classification according to point groups. They differ from crystal families in that the hexagonal crystal family is split into two subsets, called the trigonal and hexagonal crystal systems. The trigonal crystal system is larger than the rhombohedral lattice system, the hexagonal crystal system is smaller than the hexagonal lattice system, and the remaining crystal systems and lattice systems are the same. 
|'''[[Lattice system]]s''' (7 in three dimensions). The lattice system of a space group is determined by the conjugacy class of the lattice point group (a subgroup of GL&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;('''Z''')) in the larger group GL&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;('''Q'''). In three dimensions the lattice point group can have one of the 7 different orders 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 24, or 48. The hexagonal crystal family is split into two subsets, called the rhombohedral and hexagonal lattice systems. 
|-
|colspan=2|'''[[Crystal families]]''' (6 in three dimensions). The point group of a space group does not quite determine its lattice system, because occasionally two space groups with the same point group may be in different lattice systems. Crystal families are formed from lattice systems by merging the two lattice systems whenever this happens, so that the crystal family of a space group is determined by either its lattice system or its point group. In 3 dimensions the only two lattice families that get merged in this way are the hexagonal and rhombohedral lattice systems, which are combined into the hexagonal crystal family.  The 6 crystal families in 3 dimensions are called triclinic, monoclinic, orthorhombic, tetragonal, hexagonal, and cubic. Crystal families  are commonly used in popular books on crystals, where they are sometimes called crystal systems.

They divided the 219 affine space groups into reducible and irreducible groups. The reducible groups fall into 17 classes corresponding to the 17 [[wallpaper group]]s, and the remaining 35 irreducible groups are the same as the [[cubic crystal system#Cubic space groups|cubic groups]] and are classified separately.

==In other  dimensions==

===Bieberbach's theorems===
In ''n'' dimensions, an affine space group, or Bieberbach group, is a discrete subgroup of isometries of ''n''-dimensional Euclidean space with a compact fundamental domain. {{harvs|txt|last=Bieberbach|year1=1911|year2=1912}} proved that the subgroup of translations of any such group contains ''n'' linearly independent translations, and is a free [[Abelian group|abelian]] subgroup of finite index, and is also the unique maximal normal abelian subgroup. He also showed that in any dimension ''n'' there are  only a finite number of possibilities for the isomorphism class of the underlying group of a space group, and moreover the action of the group on Euclidean space is unique up to conjugation by affine transformations. This answers part of [[Hilbert's eighteenth problem]]. {{harvtxt|Zassenhaus|1948}} showed that conversely any group that is the extension of '''Z'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; by a finite group acting faithfully is an [[Affine space|affine]] space group. Combining these results shows that classifying space groups in ''n'' dimensions up to conjugation by affine transformations is essentially the same as classifying isomorphism classes for groups that are extensions of '''Z'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; by a finite group acting faithfully.

It is essential in Bieberbach's theorems to assume that the group acts as isometries; the theorems do not generalize to discrete cocompact groups of affine transformations of Euclidean space. A counter-example is given by the 3-dimensional Heisenberg group of the integers acting by translations on the Heisenberg group of the reals, identified with 3-dimensional Euclidean space. This is a discrete cocompact group of affine transformations of space, but does not contain a subgroup '''Z'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.

===Classification in small dimensions===

d - In 3D there are 230 crystallographic space group types, which reduces to 219 affine space group types because of some types being different from their mirror image; these are said to differ by "[[Chirality (mathematics)|enantiomorphous]] character" (e.g.  P3&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;12 and  P3&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;12). Usually "space group" refers to 3D. They were enumerated independently by {{harvtxt|Barlow|1894}},  {{harvtxt|Fedorov|1891}} and {{harvtxt|Schönflies|1891}}. &lt;BR&gt;
e - The 4895 4-dimensional groups were enumerated by {{harvs | txt|last1=Brown | first1=Harold | last2=Bülow | first2=Rolf | last3=Neubüser | first3=Joachim | last4=Wondratschek | first4=Hans | last5=Zassenhaus | first5=Hans | author5-link=Hans Zassenhaus | title=Crystallographic groups of four-dimensional space | publisher=Wiley-Interscience [John Wiley &amp; Sons] | location=New York | isbn=978-0-471-03095-9 |mr=0484179 | year=1978}}. {{harvtxt|Neubüser|Souvignier|Wondratschek|2002}} corrected the number of enantiomorphic groups from 112 to 111, so total number of groups is 4783+111=4894. There are 44 enantiomorphic point groups in 4-dimensional space. If we consider enantiomorphic groups as different, the total number of point groups is 227+44=271. &lt;BR&gt;
f - {{harvtxt|Plesken|Schulz|2000}} enumerated the ones of dimension 5. {{harvtxt|Souvignier|2003}} counted the enantiomorphs. &lt;BR&gt;
g - {{harvtxt|Plesken|Schulz|2000}} enumerated the ones of dimension 6, later the corrected figures were found.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The CARAT Homepage|url=http://wwwb.math.rwth-aachen.de/carat/|accessdate=11 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially published number of 826 Lattice types in {{harvtxt|Plesken|Hanrath|1984}} was corrected to 841 in {{harvtxt|Opgenorth|Plesken|Schulz|1998}}. See also {{harvtxt|Janssen|Birman|Koptsik|Verger-Gaugry|2002}}. {{harvtxt|Souvignier|2003}} counted the enantiomorphs, but that paper relied on old erroneous CARAT data for dimension 6.

===Magnetic groups and time reversal===

In addition to crystallographic space groups there are also magnetic space groups (also called two-color (black and white) crystallographic groups or Shubnikov groups). These symmetries contain an element known as time reversal. They treat time as an additional dimension, and the group elements can include time reversal as reflection in it. They are of importance in [[magnetic structure]]s that contain ordered unpaired spins, i.e. [[ferromagnetism|ferro-]], [[ferrimagnetism|ferri-]] or [[antiferromagnetism|antiferromagnetic]] structures as studied by [[neutron diffraction]]. The time reversal element flips a magnetic spin while leaving all other structure the same and it can be combined with a number of other symmetry elements. Including time reversal there are 1651 magnetic space groups in 3D {{harv|Kim|1999|loc=p.428}}. It has also been possible to construct magnetic versions for other overall and lattice dimensions ([https://web.archive.org/web/20111119065722/http://www.bk.psu.edu/faculty/litvin/Download.html Daniel Litvin's papers], {{harv|Litvin|2008}}, {{harv|Litvin|2005}}). Frieze groups are magnetic 1D line groups and layer groups are magnetic wallpaper groups, and the axial 3D point groups are magnetic 2D point groups. Number of original and magnetic groups by (overall, lattice) dimension:
* (0,0): 1, 2
* (1,0): 2, 5
* (1,1): 2, 7
* (2,0): 10, 31
* (2,1): 7, 31
* (2,2): 17, 80
* (3,0): 32, 122
* (3,1): 75, 394 (rod groups, not 3D line groups in general)
* (3,2): 80, 528
* (3,3): 230, 1651  
* (4,0): 271, 1202
* (4,1): 343, {{harv|Palistrant|2012}}
* (4,2): 1091, {{harv|Palistrant|2012}}
* (4,3): 1594, {{harv|Palistrant|2012}}
* (4,4): 4894, 62227 {{harv|Souvignier|2006}}

'''Note'''. An ''e'' plane is a double glide plane, one having glides in two different directions. They are found in seven orthorhombic, five tetragonal and five cubic space groups, all with centered lattice. The use of the symbol ''e'' became official with {{harvtxt|Hahn|2002}}.

The lattice system can be found as follows. If the crystal system is not trigonal then the lattice system is of the same type. If the crystal system is trigonal, then the lattice system is hexagonal unless the space group is one of the seven in the [[rhombohedral lattice system]] consisting of the 7 trigonal space groups in the table above whose name begins with R. (The term rhombohedral system is also sometimes used as an alternative name for the whole trigonal system.) The [[hexagonal lattice system]] is larger than the hexagonal crystal system, and consists of the hexagonal crystal system together with the 18 groups of the trigonal crystal system other than the seven whose names begin with R.

The [[Bravais lattice]] of the space group is determined by the lattice system together with the initial letter of its name, which for the non-rhombohedral groups is P, I, F, or C, standing for the principal, body centered, face centered, or C-face centered lattices.

'''Stoughton Opera House''' is a [[Theater (structure)|theater]] in [[Stoughton, Wisconsin]].  It is on the second floor of the Stoughton City Hall.

== History ==
The Stoughton Opera House was originally known as the City Auditorium. It opened on February 22, 1901 with Ullie Akerstrom's comic play, ''The Doctor's Warm Reception''. During the next 50 years, the Opera House was used for plays, political rallies, [[Temperance movement|temperance]] speeches, boxing and wrestling matches, high school graduations, and class plays. From 1910 to the late 1920s, it also served as a movie theater. In the 1950s the theater was closed and fell into ruin. In the late 1980s a decision was made to save the building, restore its ornate [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]] interior, and rebuild the clock tower. The venue is now used for weddings, business and government meetings, rallies, and other functions. The building is in the [[Stoughton Main Street Commercial Historic District]].

== Repertoire ==
In its early days, the theater's repertoire primarily featured plays, [[vaudeville]] reviews by traveling companies, and concerts. Since its reopening, its repertoire has consisted of plays by local companies, classical music concerts, and concerts by well-known touring musicians and bands.

'''Susan Coyne''' is a [[Canada|Canadian]] writer and actress, best known as one of the co-creators and co-stars of the award-winning ''[[Slings and Arrows]]'', a TV&amp;nbsp;series which ran 2003–06 about a Canadian [[Shakespeare]]an theatre company. In 2006, she won two [[Gemini Award]]s for her work on the show, one for best performance in a supporting role and one for best writing for a dramatic series (shared with her fellow co-creators, [[Bob Martin (comedian)|Bob Martin]] and [[Mark McKinney]]). In 2007, she again won for writing, but lost to co-star [[Martha Burns]] in the acting category. She has been nominated for four [[Writers Guild of Canada]] awards, in 2006 and 2007 and 2015, and won three.

She wrote the screenplay for the 2017 film,''[[The Man Who Invented Christmas (film)|The Man Who Invented Christmas]]'', starring [[Dan Stevens]] and [[Christopher Plummer]]. Other television writing credits include ''[[Mozart in the Jungle]]'', ''[[The Best Laid Plans (TV series)|The Best Laid Plans]]'', and ''[[L.M. Montgomery's Anne of Green Gables]]''.

A veteran of the Toronto theatre scene, she acted for several seasons at the [[Stratford Festival]], was one of the founding members of the [[Soulpepper Theatre Company]] and is currently a playwright-in-residence at the [[Tarragon Theatre]]. Her two best-known plays are ''Kingfisher Days'', an adaptation of her critically acclaimed memoir of the same name, and ''Alice's Affair''. The edition of this memoir that was published in America was titled ''In the Kingdom of Fairies.''  It recounts her experiences in the summer of 1963 at her family's summer cottage on [[Lake of the Woods]]. She is also known for her translations of [[Anton Chekhov]]. Coyne also appeared in the [[Fernando Meirelles]] adaptation of the [[Jose Saramago]] novel, ''[[Blindness (2008 film)|Blindness]]''.

Coyne comes from a prominent Canadian family: she is the daughter of [[James Coyne]], a former governor of the [[Bank of Canada]], the sister of journalist [[Andrew Coyne]] and the cousin of constitutional lawyer [[Deborah Coyne]]. She attended the [[St. John's-Ravenscourt School]] in Winnipeg, as did her acting colleague Martha Burns. In 2017 she was appointed a Member of the Order of Canada by the Governor General for her contributions to Canadian theatre, film and television as an actor and writer. She is a graduate of the [[National Theatre School of Canada]] and was married to Canadian actor/director [[Albert Schultz]]. They have two children.

'''The Lonely Boys''' (in Swedish, ”De ensamma pojkarna”) is a [[fiction]] book by [[Sweden|Swedish]] author Mats Olsson about a young rhythm'n'pop band from the south of [[Sweden]] in 1965.

[[Per Gessle]] (of [[Roxette]] fame) was asked by Mats Olsson to write a soundtrack to follow the book, and so the band "The Lonely Boys" came into existence and the debut album by this 1965 fictitious band was released in December 1995.

The band went to great lengths to make the sound authentic 1960s; from the lyrical content (Why did Adam have to fall in love with Eve) to the authentic instruments and amplifiers used in the recording process. The album is set out as two sides of an [[LP album|LP]] (although it was available on a promotional LP in Sweden), including crackles of the needle on the [[Phonograph|turntable]] and a pause in between the two sides as the record is turned over.

==Band members==
The Lonely Boys consists of:
* Lasse Göransson (a.k.a. [[Thomas Holst]]) on [[Bass guitar]]
* Roland Bergström (a.k.a. [[MP Persson]]) on [[Vox (musical equipment)|Vox]]- &amp; [[Hammond organ]]s, [[Piano]]
* Kalle Johansson (a.k.a. [[Micke Syd Andersson]]) on [[drums]] and [[tambourine]]
* Thomas Nyberg (a.k.a. [[Per Gessle]]) on [[rhythm guitar]] and [[vocals]]
* Richard Andersson (a.k.a. [[Nisse Hellberg]]) on [[lead guitar]], [[harmonica]], [[maracca]]s, tambourine and vocals

==The songs==
There are 14 songs on the album, with the only cover version being "So Much In Love", which was written by [[Mick Jagger]] and [[Keith Richards]] of [[The Rolling Stones]] (although the Stones never recorded a version, [[The Inmates]] did).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8842">'''Tour promoters'''   (also known as '''concert promoters''' or talent buyers) are the individuals or companies responsible for organizing a live [[concert tour]] or special event performance. The tour promoter makes an offer of employment to a particular artist, usually through the artist’s [[talent agent|agent]] or [[music manager]]. The promoter and agent then negotiate the live performance [[contract]]. The majority of live performance contracts are drawn up using the [[American Federation of Musicians]] (AFM) standard contract format known as the ''AFM Performance Agreement''.

==Services==
Included among the tour promoter’s various job responsibilities are: (1) obtaining [[Music venue|venue]], [[concert hall]], [[theater]], [[nightclub]] or [[arena]] bookings; (2) pricing the event or tour; and (3) providing air, sea or land [[transportation]] (optional). However the promoter must have upfront cash and or [[sponsor (commercial)|sponsorship]] financing to pay for advertising the tours of the artists. Such advertising costs, usually referred to as a Media or Promotional Kit, commonly include [[television]] and radio [[advertisement]]s, [[poster]]s, [[newspaper]] and [[magazine]] adverts, [[online marketing]] and so on.

==Promoter compensation==
There are no figures available concerning how much an average concert promoter makes annually. Like most [[music industry]] professions, compensation depends on the level of success possessed by the artist the promoter works with, location, and what a given market will bear. The promoter assumes all the financial risk in putting on a show, so compensation also depends on how successful the promoter is at negotiating with [[Distributor (business)|vendors]] and creating sold-out shows. Additionally, in-depth knowledge of their operating market and audience characteristics are critical success factors for any tour promoter.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.musicbizadvice.com/qa_how_much_does_the_average_concert_promoter_make_per_year_and_how_hard_is_the_course_of_study.htm MusicBizAdvice Q&amp;A] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090115173626/http://www.musicbizadvice.com/qa_how_much_does_the_average_concert_promoter_make_per_year_and_how_hard_is_the_course_of_study.htm |date=2009-01-15 }} January 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

==Industry overview==
The rise of large corporation mega-promoters over the past ten years has made it much more difficult for aspiring tour promoters to break into the industry. [[Live Nation]] (previously known as [[Clear Channel Entertainment]]) is the number one concert promoter in the world according to figures released by ''Pollstar Magazine'' in 2006. The [[Beverly Hills, California]]-based corporation accounted for about $1.3 billion in concert [[box-office]] sales during 2005, according to [[Billboard magazine]]'s tracking. [[Anschutz Entertainment Group]] ([[AEG Live]]) was ranked second with $417 million, followed by [[House of Blues]] (HOB Entertainment) at number three with $245 million. On July 5, 2006, Live Nation purchased HOB Entertainment for $350 million, further expanding their market share in the live-music business.&lt;ref name=nyt1&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/06/business/media/06music.html?_r=1&amp;oref=slogin Big Promoter of Concerts to Acquire House of Blues], ''[[New York Times]]''. July 6, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

While average ticket prices jumped to roughly $57 in 2005, the number of tickets sold for the 100 biggest tours dipped 3.5%, to 36.3 million.&lt;ref name=nyt1/&gt; Some fans have complained to government officials, particularly after they found tickets to the same concerts or sporting events available - sometimes at many times the face value - on secondary sellers like Stubhub.com and TicketsNow minutes after the public sale began. After hearing from some would-be ticket buyers, the [[Missouri]] [[attorney general]] announced the state was suing three ticket resellers on charges they violated state consumer protection laws. That same day, the [[Arkansas]] attorney general said he was seeking documents from five resellers. And the attorney general’s office in [[Pennsylvania]] is also looking into the ticket sale business after receiving several hundred complaints over the recent sale of tickets for a [[Hannah Montana]] concert in Pittsburgh.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/06/business/06money.html?scp=9&amp;sq=concert&amp;st=nyt In the Race to Buy Concert Tickets, Fans Keep Losing], ''[[New York Times]]''. October 6, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

===Live Nation and Ticketmaster===
On December 21, 2007, Live Nation announced it would acquire the software and services to ramp up its ticket-selling operation, potentially positioning the company to compete directly with its longtime contractor, [[Ticketmaster]].&lt;ref name=nyt2&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/21/business/21music.html?scp=1&amp;sq=concert&amp;st=nyt Top Concert Promoter Sets Up a Challenge to Ticketmaster] ''[[New York Times]]''. December 21, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Live Nation, the largest concert promoter, and Ticketmaster Entertainment, the No. 1 ticket seller, announced merger on February 10, 2009.  Then on January 25, 2010 the [[U.S. Department of Justice]] approved the merger with terms that include that Ticketmaster sell Paciolan, its ticketing and software services unit, to Comcast's sports and entertainment firm or "another buyer suitable to the department."

Ticketmaster must also license its software to [[Anschutz Entertainment Group]] (AEG), the company’s largest customer. With a copy of the Ticketmaster software, AEG will be able to market an attractive ticketing system to venues, according to the DOJ; under the settlement terms, both companies will be able to compete head-to-head with Ticketmaster.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Reagan|first=Gillian|title=Ticketmaster And Live Nation Get Approval As One Giant Music Monster |url=http://www.businessinsider.com/ticketmaster-and-livenation-get-approval-as-one-giant-music-ticket-monster-2010-1#ixzz1PenCQbOG|work=Business Insider|accessdate=12 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===College concert market===
Colleges can provide "dedicated fans, an excellent testing ground, eager workers, [and] loyal fans."  The college market provides a network of new potential fans that artists, labels, agents, and managers could focus on for promotion.  The major record labels have departments dedicated to college promotion and hire students as representatives for all the artists on these labels.  [[Sony Music Entertainment]] has a college marketing department, which promotes records released by Sony and by their independent label affiliates.  Other music marketing companies such as Cornerstone Promotion focus on college marketing.  Cornerstone Promotion hires representatives from colleges all around the country to implement small scale marketing campaigns on their campuses.  
Artists began breaking into the college market in the 1990s.  [[Billboard Magazine]] published articles dating back to the early-mid nineties urging artists and agents to take advantage of the college market.  Artists such as [[Dave Matthews Band]] and R.E.M. played college shows to increase their presence in the college market in the nineties.  Billboard Magazine has emphasized the extent to which college concerts can help an artist in multiple articles.

==Education==
There are numerous degree programs and academic courses focusing on concert promotion and venue management. Some of these are full degree programs, while others are certificates offered for post-graduate studies. For example, [[New York University]] offers a Certificate in Meeting, Conference, and Event Management, and a Certificate in Sports Marketing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scps.nyu.edu/departments/department.jsp?deptId=21 New York University] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071010063335/http://www.scps.nyu.edu/departments/department.jsp?deptId=21 |date=2007-10-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{italic title}}
'''''Who Does She Think She Is?''''' is a 2008 American [[documentary film]] directed by [[Pamela Tanner Boll]] about the societal push for women to choose between art and motherhood and the struggle five female artists (Maye Torres, Angela Williams, Camille Musser, Mayumi Oda and Janice Mars Wunderlich) face in reconciling both parts of their lives. Boll was the co-executive producer of the 2005 Academy Award-winning documentary, ''[[Born Into Brothels]]''.  

==Content==
The film follows five diverse women artists; Maye Torres, Mayumi Oda, Camille Musser, Angela Williams and Janice Mars Wunderlich, ranging in age from 27 to 65 from all over the [[United States]] as they chart a path to create their individual type of art while balancing the demands of motherhood and societal expectations. By following the lives of these five artists, the film explores the intersections of motherhood and creativity, partnering and independence, economics and art, parenting and work. ''Who Does She Think She Is?'' looks at “the under-representation of mothers in the arts and other creative fields.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Nagy|first1=Kimberly|title=Who Does She Think She Is?|url=http://www.wildriverreview.com/arts/film-reviews/who-does-she-think-she-is/|website=Wild River Review|accessdate=5 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview with ''The Wall Street Journal'', Boll says that a main theme connecting the women was the “idea of giving yourself permission to do that work you’re called to do.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Donner|first1=Francesca|title=Who Does She Think She Is? — A Close-Up On Women in the Art World|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/frontlines/2008/10/17/who-does-she-think-she-is-a-closeup-on-women-in-the-art-world/|website=The Wall Street Journal|accessdate=5 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''The New York Times'', the film “provides a nuanced look at the sacrifices and challenges facing female artists who become mothers.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Alboher|first1=Marci|title=Artist/Mother, an Uneasy Marriage|url=http://shiftingcareers.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/10/14/artistmother-an-uneasy-marriage/?_r=0|website=The New York Times|accessdate=5 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She is the mother of three sons; Isaiah, a glass artist and musician;  Zach, an accomplished pianist and composer; and Matthias, PhD candidate in Chemical Engineering Univ. of Florida, Gainesville.

'''Janis Wunderlich''', a sculptor, mother of five, and full time working artist. Wunderlich creates fairytale-esque creatures out of clay.

==Reception==
One critic has stated, "It’s not every documentary that compels me to stay up writing most of the night and that weighs heavily on my mind for days. But, then again, ''Who Does She Think She Is?'' is not your average documentary."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Nagy|first1=Kimberly|title=Who Does She Think She Is?|url=http://www.wildriverreview.com/arts/film-reviews/who-does-she-think-she-is/|website=Wild River Review|accessdate=5 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been more mixed reviews, one magazine saying that the film has “revelatory moments” but also provides too restrictive a definition of “artist” and at times was “clumsily” composed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Henderson|first1=Eric|title=Who Does She Think She Is?|url=http://www.slantmagazine.com/film/review/who-does-she-think-she-is|website=Slant Magazine|accessdate=5 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Elliot|first1=Farley|title=Review: Who Does She Think She Is?|url=http://laist.com/2009/04/09/review_who_does_she_think_she_is.php|website=Laist|accessdate=5 December 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171105220832/http://laist.com/2009/04/09/review_who_does_she_think_she_is.php|archivedate=5 November 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The New York Times'' called the film an answer to the call of “self-expression in the face of biological imperatives and cultural programming.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Catsoulis|first1=Jeanette|title=The Competing Demands of Muse and Family|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/17/movies/17thin.html|website=The New York Times|accessdate=5 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Village Voice'' has called it “a call to arms.”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wilonsky|first1=Robert|title=Who Does She Think She Is?
