In the field of [[taxation]] in the US, the '''12 Month Rule''' refers to the [[capital expenditure|capitalization]] of [[property]] or [[asset]]s that provide only short-term benefits. The 12 Month Rule makes it unnecessary to capitalize the cost of purchase or production of anything with a useful life of less than a year, although it is not without exception. Prop. Reg. 1.263(a)-2(d)(4)(i) serves to [[Codification (law)|codify]] the 12 Month Rule and the generally accepted view that capitalization is only required for costs related to the purchase or production of fixed assets that will continue to provide a benefit over the course of several years, or at least for a time significantly longer than the taxable year.&lt;ref&gt;Donaldson, Samuel A. ''Federal Income Taxation Of Individuals: Cases, Problems and Materials'' (2nd ed.). St. Paul: Thomson West, 2007. pg. 174&lt;/ref&gt;

'''ACCOBAMS''', the Agreement on the Conservation of Cetaceans in the [[Black Sea]],
[[Mediterranean Sea]] and contiguous [[Atlantic ocean|Atlantic]] area is ‘a cooperative tool for the conservation of marine biodiversity in the Mediterranean and Black Seas’.&lt;ref name="accobams.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.accobams.org/2006.php/pages/show/9|title=Accobams|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080316072237/http://www.accobams.org/2006.php/pages/show/9|archivedate=2008-03-16|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ACCOBAMS aims to reduce threats to cetaceans in Mediterranean and Black Sea waters and improve our knowledge of these animals, and is the first Agreement binding the countries in the two subregions, enabling them to work together on a matter of general interest.&lt;ref name="accobams.org"/&gt; ACCOBAMS was concluded in the auspices of [[Convention on Migratory Species]] in 1996 and entered into force in 2001.

==Structure==
{{Empty section|date=July 2010}}

==Meeting of the Parties==
The Meeting of the Parties is the decision-making body of the Agreement. Ordinary sessions of the Meeting of the Parties occur at intervals of not more than three years, unless the Meeting of the Parties decides otherwise.
The United Nations, its Specialized Agencies, the International Atomic Energy Agency, any State not a Party to this Agreement, secretariats of other global and regional conventions or agreements concerned inter alia with the conservation of cetaceans, and regional or subregional fisheries management organizations with competence for species found temporarily or permanently resident in the Agreement area may be represented by observers in sessions of the Meeting of the Parties. .&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accobams.org/2006.php/pages/show/31 www.accobams.org] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080516043321/http://www.accobams.org/2006.php/pages/show/31 |date=2008-05-16 }} ACCOBAMS – Meeting of the Parties&lt;/ref&gt;

==Secretariat==
The ACCOBAMS Permanent Secretariat performs the functions listed in Article IV of the Agreement. For example, it arranges and services the sessions of the Meeting of the Parties, facilitates co-operation between Parties and non-Party [[Range States]], assists the Parties in the implementation of the Agreement, administers the budget. The Permanent Secretariat is hosted by the [[Principality of Monaco]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accobams.org/2006.php/pages/show/30 www.accobams.org] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080516043034/http://www.accobams.org/2006.php/pages/show/30 |date=2008-05-16 }} ACCOBAMS – Secretariat&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bureau==
Bureau provides general policy guidance and operational and financial direction to the Agreement Secretariat and the Co-ordination Units concerning the implementation and promotion of the Agreement;
carries out, between sessions of the Meeting of the Parties, such interim activities on its behalf as may be necessary or assigned to it by the Meeting of the Parties;
represents the Parties vis-à-vis the Government(s) of the host country (or countries) of the Agreement Secretariat and the Meeting of the Parties, the Depositary and other international organizations on matters relating to the Agreement and its secretariat.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11525">{{About|land law in Ancient Rome|modern laws concerning [[agriculture]]|Agricultural law}}

'''Agrarian laws''' (from the [[Latin]] ''ager'', meaning "land") were [[Roman law|laws]] among the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] regulating the division of the public [[real property|lands]], or ''[[ager publicus]]''.

Various attempts to reform agrarian laws were part of the socio-political struggle between the [[Patrician (ancient Rome)|patricians]] and [[plebeians]] known as the [[Conflict of the Orders]].

==Introduction==
There existed two kinds of land in ancient Rome: private and public land (''ager publicus''), which included common pasture. By the 2nd century BC, wealthy landowners had begun to dominate the agrarian areas of the republic by "renting" large tracts of public land and treating it as if it were private.  This began to force out smaller, private farmers with competition; the farmers were forced to move to the cities for this and a number of other factors including battles making living in rural areas dangerous.  Roman cities were not good places to attempt to get jobs; they were also dangerous, overcrowded and messy.

==Proposed land distribution in 486 BC==
Probably the earliest attempt at an agrarian law was in 486 BC.&lt;ref name = livy241&gt;[[Livy]], ''[[Ab urbe condita (book)|Ab urbe condita]]'', [[s:From the Founding of the City/Book 2#41|2.41]]&lt;/ref&gt;  A peace [[Roman conquest of the Hernici#The foedus Cassianum{{snd}}5th century BC|treaty]] was entered into with the [[Hernici]] whereby they agreed to cede two-thirds of their land. [[Spurius Cassius Viscellinus]], [[Roman consul]] for the third time, proposed to distribute that land, together with other public Roman land, amongst the [[Latin League|Latin allies]] and the plebs. Cassius proposed a law to give effect to his proposal.&lt;ref name = livy241/&gt;  Niebuhr suggests that the law sought to restore the law of [[Servius Tullius]], the sixth King of Rome, strictly defining the portion of the patricians in the public land, dividing the remainder amongst the plebeians, and requiring that the tithe be levied from the lands possessed by the patricians.&lt;ref&gt;[[Barthold Georg Niebuhr]], ''History of Rome'', vol. ii, p. 166 ''ff'', ''Lectures on the History of Rome'', p. 89 ''ff'', ed. Schmitz (1848).&lt;/ref&gt;

The proposed law was opposed by the senators (some of whom it seemed were squatting on the public Roman land) and by the other consul [[Proculus Verginius Tricostus Rutilus]].  Their opposition to the law was also based on their concerns that Cassius was seeking to gain too much popularity.&lt;ref name = livy241/&gt;

Verginius spoke publicly against the law, and the plebs became concerned that land was being given to the Latin allies, and also that Cassius might be seeking to pave the way to regal power.  Verginius even suggested he would support the law if it was in favour only of Romans and not Rome's allies.  To counter him, Cassius promised that the money raised from the [[First secessio plebis in 494 BC#Aftermath|Sicilian corn distribution]] be donated to the plebs, but they rejected this as a political bribe, and suspicion that Cassius was seeking regal power increased.&lt;ref name = livy241/&gt;

In 485 BC once Cassius had left office he was condemned and executed.  Livy says that the method of his trial is uncertain.  Livy's preferred version is that a public trial on the charge of [[perduellio|high treason]] was held on the orders of the [[Quaestor#Quaestores parricidii|quaestores parricidii]] [[Caeso Fabius Vibulanus (consul)|Kaeso Fabius]] and [[Lucius Valerius Potitus (consul in 483 and 470 BC)|Lucius Valerius]], at which Cassius was condemned by the [[Century Assembly|people]], and subsequently by public decree his house was demolished (being near the [[Terra (mythology)#Temple|temple of Tellus]]).  The alternative version is that Cassius' own father conducted a private trial (presumably exercising authority as [[pater familias]], although Niebuhr argues that it was impossible that a man who had been thrice consul and twice triumphed should still be in his father's power.&lt;ref&gt;[[Barthold Georg Niebuhr]], ''History of Rome'', vol. ii, p. 166 ''ff'', ''Lectures on the History of Rome'', p. 89 ''ff'', ed. Schmitz (1848)&lt;/ref&gt;) and put his son to death, and subsequently dedicated his son's assets to the goddess [[Ceres (mythology)|Ceres]], including by dedicating a statue to her with the inscription ''""given from the Cassian family"''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Livy]], ''[[Ab urbe condita (book)|Ab urbe condita]]'', [[s:From the Founding of the City/Book 2#41|2.41]]&lt;/ref&gt;  Dionysius states that he was hurled from the [[Tarpeian Rock]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]], ''Romaike Archaiologia'', viii. 68-80.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some seem to have called for the execution of Cassius' sons also, but according to Dionysius, they  were spared by the senate.&lt;ref&gt;[[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]], ''Romaike Archaiologia'', viii. 80.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology]]'', [[William Smith (lexicographer)|William Smith]], Editor.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cassius Dio]] expressed his belief in the consul's innocence.&lt;ref&gt;[[Cassius Dio|Lucius Cassius Dio Cocceianus]], ''Exc. de. Sentent.'', 19, p. 150.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 159 BC the statue of Cassius erected on the spot of his house was melted down by the [[Roman censor|censors]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]], ''Romaike Archaiologia'', viii. 80.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology]]'', [[William Smith (lexicographer)|William Smith]], Editor.&lt;/ref&gt;

Popular agitation for agrarian reform continued during 484 BC.&lt;ref&gt;[[Livy]], ''[[Ab urbe condita (book)|Ab urbe condita]]'', 2.42&lt;/ref&gt;  And again in 481 and 480 BC, when the tribunes [[Spurius Licinius]] and [[Titus Pontificius]] respectively exhorted the plebs to refuse enrolment for military service as a means of encouraging agrarian reform, but the consuls and the other tribunes convinced the plebs otherwise.&lt;ref&gt;[[Livy]], ''[[Ab urbe condita (book)|Ab urbe condita]]'', 2.43-44&lt;/ref&gt;

In 476 BC the tribunes Quintus Considius and Titus Genucius successfully brought charges against [[Titus Menenius Lanatus]], and in the following year the tribunes Lucius Caedicius and Titus Statius brought charges against [[Spurius Servilius Priscus Structus (consul 476 BC)|Spurius Servilius]] but he was acquitted.  Livy says the charges were motivated by agitation for agrarian reform.&lt;ref&gt;[[Livy]], ''[[Ab urbe condita (book)|Ab urbe condita]]'', 2.52&lt;/ref&gt;

In 473 BC, the [[tribune]] Gnaeus Genucius brought to trial the consuls of the previous year, [[Lucius Furius Medullinus (consul 474 BC)|Lucius Furius Medullinus]] and [[Gnaeus Manlius Vulso (consul 474 BC)|Gnaeus Manlius Vulso]],for failing to appoint the [[Decemviri#Decemviri_Agris_Dandis_Adsignandis|decemvirs]] to allocate the public lands. However, on the day of the trial Genucius was found dead, and as a consequence the charges were dismissed.&lt;ref&gt;[[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]], ''Romaike Archaiologia'', ix. 36-38.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Livy, ''[[Ab Urbe condita (book)|Ab Urbe condita]]'', ii.54&lt;/ref&gt;

In 470 BC the tribunes Marcus Duilius and Gnaeus Siccius brought to trial the consul of the previous year, [[Appius Claudius Sabinus Regillensis (consul 471 BC)|Appius Claudius]], a man who was hated by the people.  The charge was that he had opposed the agrarian law.  However he died before the trial.  &lt;ref&gt;Livy, ''[[Ab Urbe condita (book)|Ab Urbe condita]]'', ii.61&lt;/ref&gt;

In 469 BC tensions on account of the agrarian law threatened again, but foreign wars interrupted.&lt;ref&gt;Livy, ''[[Ab Urbe condita (book)|Ab Urbe condita]]'', ii.63&lt;/ref&gt;

Tensions flared after the conclusion of the foreign conflicts, and as a consequence the plebeians refused to attend the consular elections for 468 BC.  Once again conflict at Rome was interrupted by foreign war, which resulted in the consul [[Titus Quinctius Capitolinus Barbatus]] capturing the [[Volsci|Volscian]] city of [[Anzio|Antium]] south of Rome.&lt;ref&gt;Livy, ''[[Ab Urbe condita (book)|Ab Urbe condita]]'', ii.64-65&lt;/ref&gt;

In 467 BC [[Tiberius Aemilius Mamercinus (consul 467 BC)|Tiberius Aemilius]] was elected consult for the second time, together with [[Quintus Fabius Vibulanus]].  Aemilius had previously been consul in 470 BC at the time of Claudius' trial, and had then been sympathetic to the plebeians' agrarian demands.  According the plebeians sought to raise the issue again, hoping Aemilius would act in their interests.  Indeed Aemilius was in favour of agrarian reform again, and thus incurred the odium of the patricians.  However the tensions were resolved by Aemilius' colleague Fabius, who proposed a law that a [[Roman colony]] be planted at Antium, and land there be distributed amongst the plebeians.  The measure was passed, and three men were appointed as commissioners to allocate the lands (triumviri coloniae deducendae).  They were Titus Quinctius, the consul of the previous year who had captured Antium from the Volsci; [[Aulus Verginius Tricostus Caeliomontanus (consul 469 BC)|Aulus Verginius Tricostus Caeliomontanus]] the consul of 469 BC; and [[Publius Furius Medullinus Fusus]] the consul of 472 BC.  Livy reports that in fact few of the plebeians applied for allotment of land at Antium, however reports of conflict on account of the agrarian reforms were absent for many years thereafter.&lt;ref&gt;Livy, ''[[Ab Urbe condita (book)|Ab Urbe condita]]'', iii.1&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gracchan reforms in late 2nd century BC==
In 133 BC, [[Tiberius Gracchus|Tiberius Sempronius Gracchus]], the [[tribune of the plebs]], passed a series of laws attempting to reform the agrarian land laws; the laws limited the amount of public land one person could control, reclaimed public lands held in excess of this, and attempted to redistribute the land, for a small rent, to farmers now living in the cities.

Further reforms in 122 BC were attempted by Tiberius's brother, [[Gaius Sempronius Gracchus]], including the expansion of the laws' area of influence to all of the colonies in [[History of Italy during Roman times|Italy]].  These reforms, however, were not as successful due to massive unpopularity in the Italian provinces.

By 118 BC the sales limits and redistribution efforts had been abolished, and by 111 BC the laws were standardised, confirming the positions of many owners in Italy about their large tracts of land.

The '''Air Bridge Denial''' (ABD) Program is an [[Narcotic|anti-narcotics]] program operated by the U.S. [[Central Intelligence Agency]] in [[Colombia]] and [[Peru]]. Starting in the 1990s, it targets traffickers transporting [[illegal drug trade|illicit drugs]] through the air by forcing down suspicious aircraft, using lethal force if necessary. The program was suspended in April 2001 when a legitimate civilian aircraft was shot down in Peru and two U.S. citizens were killed. It was restarted in Colombia in August 2003 after additional safeguards were established.

As of 2005, the United States had provided $68 million for the program, which had so far produced only one drug seizure. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite report

The [[Peruvian Air Force]] wrongly identified it as belonging to a drug smuggler, and a Peruvian fighter aircraft shot it down. Of the five people on the plane, Veronica Bowers and her infant daughter were killed in the incident, while her husband Jim and their son Cory, as well as the pilot Kevin Donaldson, managed to survive after crash-landing the plane on the [[Amazon River]] despite serious leg wounds.&lt;ref name=AssPress&gt;{{cite news|title= CIA punished 16 officers in Peru plane shootdown|first= Kimberly|last= Dozier|newspaper= [[Associated Press]]|date= November 1, 2010|url= https://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20101101/ap_on_go_ca_st_pe/us_cia_peru_shootdown;_ylt=AhxBeiA4zr39eZtTDgURSryyFz4D;_ylu=X3oDMTJyaHZpNWsxBGFzc2V0A2FwLzIwMTAxMTAxL3VzX2NpYV9wZXJ1X3Nob290ZG93bgRjcG9zAzExBHBvcwM4BHNlYwN5bl9oZWFkbGluZV9saXN0BHNsawNjaWFwdW5pc2hlZDE-|accessdate= November 4, 2010|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20101104080459/http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20101101/ap_on_go_ca_st_pe/us_cia_peru_shootdown|archive-date= 2010-11-04|dead-url= yes|df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 1, 2010 the Central Intelligence Agency declassified a 2008 CIA inspector general report that indicated that retired and current officers were given administrative punishments for their role in the incident. While the report laid the blame for the shoot-down at the feet of the Peruvian military, investigators concluded "there were problems with the program" and mistakes were made, requiring disciplinary action.&lt;ref name= AssPress /&gt;

'''''Alwin v. State Farm Fire and Casualty Co.''''', 610 N.W.2d 218 (Wis. Ct. App. 2000), was a case decided by the [[Wisconsin Court of Appeals]] that provided an exception to the statutory [[strict liability]] of dog owners for injuries caused by their dogs.&lt;ref&gt;Henderson, J.A. et al.  ''The Torts Process, Seventh Edition.''  Apsen Publishers, New York, NY: 2007, p. 426&lt;/ref&gt;

==Decision==
The plaintiff (the defendant's mother) tripped over the defendant's dog and sustained injuries. The Wisconsin civil code §174.02 holds dog owners strictly liable for all injuries caused by their dogs, and this theoretically allowed recovery in this case. The court, however, ruled that as a matter of [[public policy]] the defendant should not be held liable for someone tripping over their dog.&lt;ref&gt;Henderson, p. 427&lt;/ref&gt;

==Subsequent history==
Review was denied by the [[Wisconsin Supreme Court]] on May 23, 2000.&lt;ref&gt;''Alwin v. State Farm Fire and Casualty Co., 237 Wis.2d 253 (2000)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impact==
''Alwin'' has been cited as an example of case-by-case consideration of [[tort]] claims that avoids inequitable results that might follow the blind application of strict formulations of liability.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lexisone.com/lx1/caselaw/freecaselaw?action=OCLGetCaseDetail&amp;format=FULL&amp;sourceID=bdjcfg&amp;searchTerm=efGW.bbfa.aadj.efgd&amp;searchFlag=y&amp;l1loc=FCLOW Hicks v.

The '''Arbitration Act 1950''' (c.27, 14 Geo. 6) was an [[Acts of Parliament in the United Kingdom|Act]] of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] that consolidated and amended [[arbitration]] law in [[England and Wales]]. 

Although the Act has now largely been superseded by the [[Arbitration Act 1996]], Part II of the Act (dealing with the enforcement of non-[[Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards|New York Convention]] [[arbitral award|awards]]) remains in force.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1996/23/section/99 Arbitration Act 1996, section 99]&lt;/ref&gt;  This is principally to preserve the enforcement mechanism for awards made under the (now largely obsolete) [[Geneva Protocol (1924)]].

The main purpose of the Act was to consolidate and rationalise the prior statutes regulating arbitration.  However the 1950 Act became increasingly subject to criticism because of the power of the courts to review [[arbitral award|arbitration awards]] under section 21.  That section required the [[arbitration tribunal]] to make a "[[Case stated|statement of case]]" on any matter of law which was reviewable by the court.  This was unpopular and led to loss of arbitration business in the United Kingdom, and led to the repeal of the provisions under the [[Arbitration Act 1979]].

An '''asylum seeker''' (also rarely called an '''asylee''') is a person who flees his or her home country, enters another country and applies for [[right of asylum|asylum]], i.e. the right to international protection, in this other country. An asylum seeker may be a [[refugee]], a [[displaced person]], but not a migrant, such as an [[economic migrant]].  Migrants are not asylum seekers. A person becomes an asylum seeker by making a formal application for the right to remain in another country and keeps that status until the application has been concluded. The relevant immigration authorities of the country of asylum determine whether the asylum seeker will be granted protection and becomes an officially recognised refugee or whether asylum is refused and the person becomes an [[illegal immigrant]] who has to leave the country again and may even be [[deportation|deported]]. The asylum seeker may be recognised as a refugee and given [[Refugee#Refugee status|refugee status]] if the person's circumstances fall into the definition of "'''refugee'''" according to the 
[[Convention relating to the Status of Refugees|1951 Refugee Convention]] or other [[refugee law]]s, such as the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] – if asylum is claimed within the European Union. However signatories to the refugee convention create their own policies for assessing the protection status of asylum seekers, and the proportion of asylum applicants who are rejected varies from country to country and year to year.

&lt;blockquote&gt;The terms asylum seeker and refugee are often confused: an asylum-seeker is someone who says he or she is a refugee, but whose claim has not yet been definitively evaluated. On average, about 1 million people seek asylum on an individual basis every year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees |url=http://www.unhcr.org/pages/49c3646c137.html |title=Asylum-Seekers |website=Unhcr.org |date= |accessdate=2016-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Non-governmental organizations concerned with refugees and asylum seekers have pointed out difficulties for [[displaced person]]s to seek asylum in industrialized countries. As their [[immigration policy]] often focuses on the fight of [[illegal immigration]] and the strengthening of border controls it deters displaced persons from entering territory in which they could lodge an asylum claim. The lack of opportunities to legally access the asylum procedures can force asylum seekers to undertake often expensive and hazardous attempts at [[illegal entry]].

In recent years, the public as well as policy makers of many countries are focussing more and more on refugees arriving through [[third country resettlement]] and pay less and less attention to asylum seekers and those who have already been granted refugee status but did not come through resettlement. Asylum seekers may be even referred to as "queue jumpers", because they did not wait for their chance to be resettled&lt;ref&gt;Resettlement: where’s the evidence, what’s
the strategy?, Alexander Betts, Forced Migration Review 54, January 2017, page 73&lt;/ref&gt;

==Making an application== 
Some countries offer "asylum visas" which are a safe and legal way to reach the country where asylum will be claimed. Many countries don't offer that, which is why many people take large risks for entering these countries. In many countries asylum can only be claimed on arrival in the country:
* When seeking admission at a port of entry (air- or seaports) when they first arrive, i.e. before passing through immigration control.
* In-country applicants apply for asylum onshore after passing through immigration control. Some [[government]]s are tolerant and accepting of onshore asylum claims; other governments [[arrest]] or [[immigration detention|detain]] those who attempt to seek asylum; sometimes while processing their claims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/eoir/legacy/2014/08/15/Fundamentals_of_Immigration_Law.pdf |format=PDF |title=Fundamentals of Immigration Law |author=Charles A. Wiegand, III |website=Justice.gov |accessdate=2016-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* After making an [[unauthorized arrival]] and bypassing immigration control.
* After making a legal entry but then having lost the right to stay or remain, such as after having overstayed a Visa.
* As a response to being detained or apprehended by immigration enforcement.

==Different types of asylum and protection==
Asylum as an institution is not restricted to the category of individuals who qualify for refugee status. Rather on the contrary, this institution predates the birth of the international regime for the protection of refugees.

===Convention refugee status===

As at 1 July 2013, there were 145 parties to the [[1951 Refugee Convention]] and 146 to the [[1967 Protocol]]. These states are bound by an obligation under international law to grant asylum to people who fall within the definition of Convention and Protocol.&lt;ref&gt;María-Teresa Gil-Bazo, 2006: Refugee status, subsidiary protection,and the right to be granted asylum under EC law; Research Paper No. 136, page 7&lt;/ref&gt; The refugee definitions of 1951 and 1967 are the strictest and most exclusive and persons who fall within this definition are called Convention refugees and their status is called Convention refugee status. Persons who do not fall within this definition may still be granted complementary forms of protection, if they fall within other refugee definitions.

The practical determination of whether a person is a refugee or not is most often left to certain [[Government agency|government agencies]] within the host country. In some countries the refugee status determination (RSD) is done by the UNHCR. The burden of substantiating an asylum claim lies with the claimant, who must establish that they qualify for protection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/397778/ASSESSING_CREDIBILITY_AND_REFUGEE_STATUS_V9_0.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=August 31, 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160312090850/https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/397778/ASSESSING_CREDIBILITY_AND_REFUGEE_STATUS_V9_0.pdf |archivedate=March 12, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irb-cisr.gc.ca/Eng/BoaCom/references/LegJur/Pages/Credib.aspx |title=Assessment of Credibility in Claims for Refugee Protection - Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada |publisher=Irb-cisr.gc.ca |date= |accessdate=2016-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In many countries, Country of Origin information is used by migration officials as part of the assessment of asylum claims, and governments commission research into the accuracy of their country reports. Some countries have studied the rejection rates of their migration officials making decisions, finding that individuals reject more applicants than others assessing similar cases - and migration officials are required to standardise the reasons for accepting or rejecting claims, so that the decision of one adjudicator is consistent with what their colleagues decide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alrc.gov.au/publications/22-refugee-law/improving-consistency-decision-making |title=Improving consistency in decision-making |publisher=ALRC |date= 2011-12-19|accessdate=2015-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Complementary forms of protection===

The refugee definition of the 1951 Convention is universally binding, but there are many other [[Refugee#Legal definition|definitions]] according to which protection may be offered to people who do not fall within this definition.

====Subsidiary protection status====
[[Subsidiary protection]] is an international protection for persons seeking asylum, but do not qualify as refugees. It is an option to get asylum for those who do not have a well founded fear of persecution (which is required for refugee status according to the 1951 Convention), but do indeed have a substantial risk to be subjected to torture or to a serious harm if they are returned to their country of origin, for reasons that include war, violence, conflict and massive violations of human rights.&lt;ref&gt;María-Teresa Gil-Bazo, 2006: Refugee status, subsidiary protection,
and the right to be granted asylum under EC law; Research Paper No. 136, page 10&lt;/ref&gt; The Universal Declaration of Human Rights and European Union law have a broader definition of who is entitled to asylum.

====Temporary protection visa====
[[Temporary protection visa]]s are used to persons in Australia who applied for refugee status after making an unauthorised arrival. It is the main type of visa issued to refugees when released from Australian immigration detention facilities and they are required to reapply for it every three years.

==Status determination processes==
{{see|Refugee#Refugee status determination|Refugee law#Refugee status determination}}
===Group determination===
Asylum seekers may be given refugee status on a group basis. Refugees who went thought the group status determination are also referred to as [[prima facie]] refugees. This is done in situations when the reasons for seeking refugee status are generally well known and individual assessment would otherwise overwhelm the capacities of assessors. Group determination is more readily done in states that not only have accepted the refugee definition of the 1951 Convention, but also use a refugee definition that includes people fleeing indiscriminate or generalized violence, which are not covered in the 1951 Convention.&lt;ref name ="UN11"&gt;[http://www.unhcr.org/46f7c0ee2.pdf UNHCR Resettlement Handbook, United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, 2011, page 19]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Individual assessment===
For persons who do not come into the country as part of a bigger group individual asylum interviews are conducted to establish whether the person has sufficient reasons for seeking asylum.

===Appeals===
In many countries, asylum applicants can challenge a rejection by challenging the decision in a court or migration review panel. In the United Kingdom, more than one in four decisions to refuse an asylum seeker protection are overturned by immigration judges.&lt;ref&gt;Shaw, Jan [http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/jan-shaw/asylum-appeals_b_3107750.html "Will the UK Continue to Have One in Four Refused Asylum Cases Overturned on Appeal?"], ''[[The Huffington Post]]'', 18 April 2013. Retrieved 20 March 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rights of asylum seekers==
Whilst waiting for a decision asylum seekers have limited rights in the country of asylum. In most countries they are not allowed to work and in some countries not even to volunteer. In some countries they are not allowed to move freely within the country. Even access to health care is limited. In the European Union, those who have yet to be granted official status as [[refugee]]s and are still within the asylum process have some restricted rights to healthcare access.&lt;ref name = "tone2"&gt;{{ cite journal| author = Schneider, C., S. Joos, and K. Bozorgmehr |year = 2015 |title= Disparities in health and access to healthcare between asylum seekers and residents in Germany: a population-based cross-sectional feasibility study| journal= BMJ Open |volume = 5 |issue = 11}}&lt;/ref&gt; This includes access to medical and psychological care.&lt;ref name = "tone2"/&gt; However, these may vary depending on the host country.  For instance, under the Asylum Seekers Benefits Act in Germany, asylum seekers are outside primary care and are limited to emergency health care, vaccinations, pregnancy and childbirth with limitations on specialty care.&lt;ref name = "tone2"/&gt;  Asylum seekers have greater chance of experiencing unmet health needs as compared to the general German population. They also have greater odds of hospital admissions and at least one visit to a psychotherapists relative to the German general population.

==Destitution==
Because asylum seekers often have to wait for months or years for the results of their asylum applications and because they are usually not allowed to work and only receive minimal or no financial support destitution is a considerable risk.

Asylum seekers usually get some kind of support from governments whilst their application is processed. However, in some countries this support ends immediately once they are given refugee status. But the fact that they were given refugee status does not mean that they were already given all the documents they need for starting their new lives. Because of these circumstances, some refugees are forced to sleep rough and beg for money or, if they’re lucky, rely on the generosity of charities and friends for food and shelter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.refugeecouncil.org.uk/latest/news/4076_new_refugees_face_homelessness_and_destitution |title=New refugees face homelessness and destitution |website=Refugeecouncil.org.uk |date=2014-05-07 |accessdate=2016-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Refusal of asylum==
It often happens that the country neither recognizes the [[Refugee#Refugee status|refugee status]] of the asylum seekers nor sees them as legitimate migrants and thus treats them as [[Alien (law)|illegal aliens]]. If an asylum claim has been rejected, the asylum seeker is said to be refused asylum, and called a failed asylum seeker. Some failed asylum seekers are allowed to remain temporarily, some [[voluntary return|return home voluntarily]] home and some are forcibly returned. The latter are most often placed in [[immigration detention]] before being deported.

===Right to remain temporarily===
Even though asylum wasn't granted the applicant may be given the right to remain temporarily. In the UK refused cases may be granted humanitarian protection (usually for 5 years) or discretionary leave to remain.

===Deportation===
{{main|Deportation}}

Refugees cannot be deported or otherwise forced to go back to their country of origin as this would be [[refoulement]], which is against international law. But in many cases failed asylum seekers, i.e. who failed to be considered as refugees, are equally vulnerable and may face significant risks when going back, voluntarily or not.

If asylum seekers have serious medical problems or it is not safe for them to return to their country of origin it is against international law to deport them. However, sometimes they are deported even though they face risks there and it is not safe for them to return. UK authorities have been accused of paying insufficient attention to medical evidence of torture in some cases.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-38017463 Torture evidence ignored by Home Office, says charity]&lt;/ref&gt;

Deportees may be separated from their families who can temporarily or permanently continue to remain in the country; younger persons may not have been to their country of origin for most of their lives, may not even be able to speak the language, don't know anyone and have no connection whatsoever with that country, apart from the formality of having been born there; they may be traumatised through experiences made in detention; they may be detained again as soon as they enter their country of origin; they may even be persecuted. For example, many failed asylum seekers who were returned to Congo (DRC) in 2011 were imprisoned, tortured, forced to pay a ransom, raped or subjected to sexual harassment after their return.&lt;ref&gt;Post-deportation risks for failed asylum seekers, Jill Alpes, Forced Migration Review 54, page 77&lt;/ref&gt;

==Exclusion from protection==
Asylum seekers who have committed crimes against peace, a war crime or a crime against humanity, or other serious non-political crimes, or whose actions are contrary to the purposes and principles of the United Nations, are excluded from international protection.&lt;ref&gt;Handbook on European law relating to asylum, borders and immigration, 2014, page 83&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Accounting}}
A '''basis of accounting''' is the time various financial transactions are recorded. The [[Cash method of accounting|cash basis]] (EU VAT vocabulary ''Cash accounting'') and the [[accruals|accrual basis]] are the two primary methods of tracking income and expenses in accounting. 

Both can be used in a range of situations, from the accounts of a whole country&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gao.gov/special.pubs/longterm/deficit/ |title=Measuring the Deficit: Cash vs. Accrual |publisher=[[Government Accountability Office]] |accessdate=19 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; or a large corporation to those of a small business or an individual. In many cases, regulatory bodies require individuals, businesses or corporations to use one method or the other. When this is not the case, the choice of which to use is an important decision, as both methods have advantages and disadvantages.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.inc.com/articles/2000/04/19194.html "Cash vs. Accrual Accounting"], Inc.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gao.gov/special.pubs/longterm/deficit/ "Measuring the Deficit: Cash vs. Accrual"], GAO.gov&lt;/ref&gt;

==Accrual basis==
The accrual method records income items when they are ''earned'' and records deductions when expenses are ''incurred''.&lt;ref name=AccrualDef&gt;Treas. Reg., 26 C.F.R. § 1.446-1(c)(1)(ii)&lt;/ref&gt; For a business invoicing for an item sold, or work done, the corresponding amount will appear in the books even though no payment has yet been received – and debts owed by the business show as they are incurred, even though they may not be paid until much later.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Accrual Accounting Definition {{!}} Investopedia|url = http://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/accrualaccounting.asp?adtest=term_page_v14_v1|accessdate = 2015-10-07|last = root}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the United States tax environment, the accrual basis has been an option since 1916.&lt;ref name=AccrualDef /&gt; An "accrual basis taxpayer" looks to the "[[all-events test]]" and "earlier-of test" to determine when income is earned.&lt;ref name=tests&gt;Treas. Reg., 26 C.F.R. §  1.446-1(c)(1)(ii)(A); Revenue Ruling 74–607; {{cite court |litigants=Flamingo Resort, Inc. v. United States |vol=664 |reporter=F.2d |opinion=1387 |pinpoint= |court=9th Cir. |date=1982 |url=https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/F2/664/1387/198285/ |accessdate=2018-01-10 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the all-events test, an accrual basis taxpayer generally must include income "for the taxable year when all the events have occurred which fix the right to receive such income and the amount thereof can be determined with reasonable accuracy".&lt;ref name=tests /&gt; Under the "earlier-of test", an accrual basis taxpayer receives income when (1) the required performance occurs, (2) payment therefor is due, or (3) payment therefor is made, whichever happens earliest.&lt;ref&gt;Revenue Ruling 74–607.&lt;/ref&gt; Under the earlier of test outlined in Revenue Ruling 74–607, an accrual basis taxpayer may be treated as a cash basis taxpayer when payment is received before the required performance and before the payment is actually due. An accrual basis taxpayer generally can claim a deduction "in the taxable year in which all the events have occurred that establish the fact of the liability, the amount of the liability can be determined with reasonable accuracy, and economic performance has occurred with respect to the liability".&lt;ref&gt;Treas. Reg., 26 C.F.R. § 1.461-1(a)(2)(i)&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar definition of accrual basis accounting is true for financial accounting purposes, except that revenue can't be recognized until it is earned, even if a cash payment has already been received by the tax authorities.&lt;ref name="accrual-basis-accounting"&gt;{{cite web|title=What are Accruals and the Meaning of Accrued in Accounting?|url=http://simplestudies.com/accruals-meaning-of-accrued-in-accounting.html|
publisher=Simplestudies LLC|date=25 February 2010|accessdate=25 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:''See also [[Artnell Company v. Commissioner]], US tax ruling on treatment of prepayments.''

== Modified cash basis ==
Also referred to as the modified cash basis, combines elements of both accrual and cash basis accounting. The modified method records income when it is earned but deductions when expenses are paid out. The recording of income is then of accrual basis, while the recording of expenses is cash basis. The modified method does not conform to the [[Generally accepted accounting principles|GAAP]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ernst|first1=James|title=3 Methods of HOA Accounting and How They Effect Financial Statements|url=http://www.echo-ca.org/article/3-methods-hoa-accounting-and-how-they-effect-financial-statements|website=www.echo-ca.org|publisher=ECHO|accessdate=5 August 2014|ref=3 Methods of HOA Accounting and How They Effect Financial Statements}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 2001 through 2008, he worked as a policy analyst for [[Legg Mason]] and then [[Stifel Nicolaus]]. Barron’s Magazine noted that as an analyst, Levin “has always been on top of developing trends and policy shifts in media and telecommunications … and has proved visionary in getting out in front of many of today’s headline making events.” &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title= What to Watch in Telecom: Blair Levin, Managing Director, Stifel Nicolaus |work= Barron's |author= Sandra Ward |date= October 30, 2006 |url= http://online.barrons.com/article/SB116198778536906472.html |accessdate= July 7, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, he co-chaired the technology, innovation and government reform transition team for President-elect [[Barack Obama]] and subsequently served as the Executive Director for the effort that produced the National Broadband Plan.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.broadband.gov/plan/&lt;/ref&gt;  FCC Chairman [[Tom Wheeler]] has noted that as to Levin’s role in broadband policy, “no one's done more to advance broadband expansion and competition through the vision of National Broadband Plan and Gig.U." &lt;ref&gt;http://www.broadcastingcable.com/news/fates-and-fortunes/blair-levin-joins-brookings/134621&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''constitutional referendum''' was held in the [[Russia]]n republic of [[Chechnya]] on 2 December 2007, together with the [[Russian legislative election, 2007|Russian parliamentary elections]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.interfax.ru/e/B/politics/28.html?id_issue=11921416 Interfax &gt; Politics&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110525090404/http://www.interfax.ru/e/B/politics/28.html?id_issue=11921416 |date=May 25, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the changes proposed were:

* extension of the mandates of president from five to seven years and of parliament from four to five years;
* removing restrictions on presidential terms
* adopting a [[unicameral]] parliament with 41 MPs (instead of the 58 MPs the lower house had up to that date);
* adding the [[Chechen language]] as a [[official language|state language]] alongside [[Russian language|Russian]];
* let future constitutional changes be decided by parliament.&lt;ref&gt;[http://derstandard.at/?url=/?id=3018380 derStandard.at&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The referendum succeeded with 85% of the vote in favour.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iwpr.net/?p=crs&amp;s=f&amp;o=341239&amp;apc_state=henh Chechnya: Kadyrov to Rule for Years&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Constitution of the Year X''' was a national [[constitution]] of [[France]] adopted during the Year X (10) of the [[French Revolutionary Calendar]] (1802 in the [[Gregorian calendar]]). It amended the [[Constitution of the Year VIII]], revising the [[French Consulate|Consulate]] to augment [[Napoleon Bonaparte]]'s authority by making him First Consul for Life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = French Legal Research — Georgetown Law|url = https://www.law.georgetown.edu/library/research/guides/frenchlegalresearch.cfm|website = www.law.georgetown.edu|accessdate = 2015-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both the Constitution of the Year X and the Constitution of the Year VIII were further amended by the [[Constitution of the Year XII]], which established the [[First French Empire]] with Napoleon as [[Emperor]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3154">The '''Convention on the Territorial Sea and Contiguous Zone''' of 1958 is an [[international treaty]] which entered into force on 10 September 1964, one of four agreed upon at the first [[United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea]] (UNCLOS I). The convention was ratified by 52 states.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20130705155944/http://treaties.un.org/Pages/ViewDetails.aspx?mtdsg_no=XXI-1&amp;chapter=21&amp;lang=en Ratifications].&lt;/ref&gt;

Many states have ratified the [[UNCLOS III]] convention, which came into force in 1994 and supersedes this convention.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1472">'''Crown debt''', in [[England|English]] law, a [[debt]] due to the [[The Crown|crown]]. By various statutes, the [[Crown Debts Act 1541|first]] dating from the reign of [[Henry VIII of England]] (in 1541), the crown has priority for its debts before all other [[creditor]]s. At [[common law]] the crown always had a [[lien]] on the lands and goods of debtors by record, which could be enforced even when they had passed into the hands of other persons. The difficulty of ascertaining whether lands were subject to a crown lien or not was often very great, and a remedy was provided by the [[Judgments Act 1839]], and the Crown Suits Act Coronets of Viscounts and Barons 1865. Now by the [[Land Charges Act 1900]], no debt due to the crown operates as a charge on land until a [[writ of execution]] for the purpose of enforcing it has been registered under the [[Land Charges Registration and Searches Act 1888]]. By the Act of 1541 specialty debts were put practically on the same footing as debts by record. Simple contract debts due to the crown also become specialty debts, and the rights of the crown are enforced by a summary process called an extent.

In modern parlance the term encompasses the various charges and taxes made by the [[Her Majesty's Government|Government of the United Kingdom]], including [[VAT]] and [[PAYE]].

'''DVD''' (an abbreviation of "'''digital video disc'''"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=DVD|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/dvd?s=t|website=Dictionary.com|accessdate=14 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; or "'''digital versatile disc'''")&lt;ref&gt;''Popular Mechanics'', June 1997, p. 69;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jim Taylor, ''DVD demystified'', McGraw Hill, 1998, 1st edition, p. 405&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[digital media|digital]] [[optical disc]] [[data storage device|storage]] format invented and developed in 1995. The medium can store any kind of digital data and is widely used for software and other computer files as well as video programs watched using [[DVD player]]s. DVDs offer higher storage capacity than [[compact disc]]s while having the same dimensions.

Prerecorded DVDs are mass-produced using [[Injection molding machine|molding machines]] that physically stamp data onto the DVD. Such discs are a form of DVD-[[read-only memory|ROM]] because data can only be read and not written or erased. Blank recordable DVD discs ([[DVD-R]] and [[DVD+R]]) can be recorded once using a [[Optical disc drive|DVD recorder]] and then function as a DVD-ROM. Rewritable DVDs ([[DVD-RW]], [[DVD+RW]], and [[DVD-RAM]]) can be recorded and erased many times.

DVDs are used in [[DVD-Video]] consumer digital video format and in [[DVD-Audio]] consumer digital audio format as well as for authoring DVD discs written in a special [[AVCHD#AVCHD as distribution format|AVCHD]] format to hold [[High-definition video|high definition]] material (often in conjunction with AVCHD format [[camcorder]]s). DVDs containing other types of information may be referred to as DVD data discs.

== Etymology ==
The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' comments that, "In 1995 rival manufacturers of the product initially named digital video disc agreed that, in order to emphasize the flexibility of the format for multimedia applications, the preferred abbreviation DVD would be understood to denote digital versatile disc." The OED also states that in 1995, "The companies said the official name of the format will simply be DVD. Toshiba had been using the name ‘digital video disc’, but that was switched to ‘digital versatile disc’ after computer companies complained that it left out their applications."&lt;ref&gt;[[Oxford English Dictionary]], ''DVD''.&lt;/ref&gt;

"Digital versatile disc" is the explanation provided in a DVD Forum Primer from 2000&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|title=DVD Primer
|publisher=DVD Forum
|date=September 6, 2000
|url=http://www.dvdforum.org/faq-dvdprimer.htm#1

&lt;/ref&gt;
and in the [[DVD Forum]]'s mission statement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

== History ==

=== Development ===
[[File:Comparison disk storage.svg|thumb|upright=1.35|Comparison of several forms of disk storage showing tracks (tracks not to scale); green denotes start and red denotes end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt; Some CD-R(W) and DVD-R(W)/DVD+R(W) recorders operate in [[Constant linear velocity#Zoned Constant Linear Velocity|ZCLV]], [[Constant Angular Acceleration|CAA]] or [[constant angular velocity|CAV]] modes, but most work in [[Constant linear velocity]] (CLV) mode.]]

There were several formats developed for recording video on optical discs before the DVD. Optical recording technology was invented by [[David Paul Gregg]] and [[James Russell (inventor)|James Russell]] in 1958 and first patented in 1961. A consumer optical disc data format known as [[LaserDisc]] was developed in the [[United States of America|United States]], and first came to market in [[Atlanta, Georgia]] in 1978. It used much larger discs than the later formats. Due to the high cost of players and discs, consumer adoption of LaserDisc was very low in both North America and Europe, and was not widely used anywhere outside Japan and the more affluent areas of [[Southeast Asia]], such as [[Hong-Kong]], [[Singapore]], [[Malaysia]] and [[Taiwan]].

[[CD Video]] released in 1987 used analog video encoding on optical discs matching the established standard {{convert|120|mm|abbr=on}} size of audio CDs. [[Video CD]] (VCD) became one of the first formats for distributing ''digitally'' encoded films in this format, in 1993.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | title = Super Video Compact Disc, A Technical Explanation (PDF) | year = 1998 | publisher = [[Philips]] System Standards and Licensing | page = 2 | url = http://www.ip.philips.com/view_attachment/2450/sl00812.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate = 2008-02-13 | postscript = &lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter. Either remove it; or change its value to "." for the cite to end in a ".", as necessary. --&gt;{{inconsistent citations}} }}{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year, two new optical disc storage formats were being developed. One was the Multimedia [[Compact Disc]] (MMCD), backed by [[Philips]] and [[Sony]], and the other was the Super Density (SD) disc, supported by [[Toshiba]], [[Time Warner]], [[Matsushita Electric]], [[Hitachi, Ltd.|Hitachi]], [[Mitsubishi Electric]], [[Pioneer Corporation|Pioneer]], [[Thomson SA|Thomson]], and [[JVC]]. By the time of the press launches for both formats in January 1995, the MMCD nomenclature had been dropped, and Philips and Sony were referring to their format as Digital Video Disc (DVD).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last= |first= |title=WCES: The Calm Before the Storm |journal=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]|issue=3|publisher=[[Imagine Media]]|date=March 1995|page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NGen6"&gt;{{cite journal|last= |first= |title=DVD Plagued by Double Standards |journal=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]|issue=6|publisher=[[Imagine Media]]|date=June 1995|pages=16–17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Representatives from the SD camp asked [[IBM]] for advice on the file system to use for their disc, and sought support for their format for storing computer data. [[Alan E. Bell]], a researcher from IBM's [[Almaden Research Center]], got that request, and also learned of the MMCD development project. Wary of being caught in a repeat of the costly [[videotape format war]] between [[VHS]] and [[Betamax]] in the 1980s, he convened a group of computer industry experts, including representatives from [[Apple Inc.|Apple]], [[Microsoft]], [[Sun Microsystems]], [[Dell]], and many others. This group was referred to as the Technical Working Group, or TWG.

On August 14, 1995, an [[ad hoc]] group formed from five computer companies (IBM, Apple, [[Compaq]], [[Hewlett-Packard]], and Microsoft) issued a press release stating that they would only accept a single format.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last= |first= |title=Electronic Giants Battle On|journal=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]|issue=11|publisher=[[Imagine Media]]|date=November 1995|page=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The TWG voted to boycott both formats unless the two camps agreed on a single, converged standard. They recruited [[Lou Gerstner]], president of IBM, to pressure the executives of the warring factions. In one significant compromise, the MMCD and SD groups agreed to adopt proposal SD 9, which specified that both layers of the dual-layered disc be read from the same side—instead of proposal SD 10, which would have created a two-sided disc that users would have to turn over.&lt;ref name="Soon"&gt;{{cite journal |page=189 |journal = [[Computer Shopper (US magazine)|Computer Shopper]] |date=March 1, 1996|volume=16|issue= 3|title=DVD: coming soon to your PC?}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the DVD specification provided a storage capacity of 4.7 GB for a single-layered, single-sided disc and 8.5 GB for a dual-layered, single-sided disc.&lt;ref name="Soon"/&gt; The DVD specification ended up similar to Toshiba and Matsushita's Super Density Disc, except for the dual-layer option (MMCD was single-sided and optionally dual-layer, whereas SD was two half-thickness, single-layer discs which were pressed separately and then glued together to form a double-sided disc&lt;ref name="NGen6"/&gt;) and [[Eight-to-Fourteen Modulation|EFMPlus]] modulation designed by [[Kees Schouhamer Immink]].

Philips and Sony decided that it was in their best interests to end the format war, and agreed to unify with companies backing the Super Density Disc to release a single format, with technologies from both. After other compromises between MMCD and SD, the computer companies through TWG won the day, and a single format was agreed upon. The TWG also collaborated with the [[Optical Storage Technology Association]] (OSTA) on the use of their implementation of the ISO-13346 file system (known as [[Universal Disk Format]]) for use on the new DVDs.

=== Adoption ===
[[Movie]] and [[home video|home entertainment]] distributors adopted the DVD format to replace the ubiquitous [[VHS]] tape as the primary consumer digital video distribution format.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/3335984/DVD-kills-the-video-show-as-digital-age-takes-over.html|title=DVD kills the video show as digital age takes over|first=Robert|last=Uhlig|date=22 November 2004|accessdate=28 October 2017|website=Telegraph.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; They embraced DVD as it produced higher quality video and sound, provided superior data lifespan, and could be interactive.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}} Interactivity on [[LaserDisc]]s had proven desirable to consumers, especially collectors. When LaserDisc prices dropped from approximately $100 per disc to $20 per disc at retail, this luxury feature became available for mass consumption. Simultaneously, the movie studios decided to change their home entertainment release model from a rental model to a for purchase model,{{Citation needed|date=January 2015}} and large numbers of DVDs were sold.

At the same time, a demand for interactive design talent and services was created. Movies in the past had uniquely designed title sequences. Suddenly every movie being released required information architecture and interactive design components that matched the film's tone and were at the quality level that Hollywood demanded for its product.

DVD as a format had two qualities at the time that were not available in any other interactive medium: enough capacity and speed to provide high quality, full motion video and sound, and low cost delivery mechanism provided by consumer products retailers. Retailers would quickly move to sell their players for under $200, and eventually for under $50 at retail. In addition, the medium itself was small enough and light enough to mail using general first class postage. Almost overnight, this created a new business opportunity and model for business innovators to re-invent the home entertainment distribution model. It also gave companies an inexpensive way to provide business and product information on full motion video through direct mail.

Immediately following the formal adoption of a unified standard for DVD, two of the four leading [[video game console]] companies ([[Sega]] and [[The 3DO Company]]) said they already had plans to design a gaming console with DVDs as the source medium.&lt;ref name="NGen18"&gt;{{cite magazine|last= |first= |title=DVD Game Consoles? |magazine=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]|issue=18 |publisher=[[Imagine Media]]|date=June 1996|page=40}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Sony, despite being one of the developers of the DVD format and eventually the first company to actually release a DVD-based console, stated at the time that they had no plans to use DVD in their gaming systems.&lt;ref name="NGen18"/&gt;) Game consoles such as the [[PlayStation 2]], [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]], and [[Xbox 360]] use DVDs as their source medium for games and other software. Contemporary games for Windows were also distributed on DVD.

==Specifications==
The DVD specifications created and updated by the [[DVD Forum]] are published as so-called ''DVD Books'' (e.g. DVD-ROM Book, DVD-Audio Book, DVD-Video Book, DVD-R Book, DVD-RW Book, DVD-RAM Book, [[DVD-AR]] Book, [[DVD-VR]] Book, etc.).&lt;ref name="dvd-book"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dvdfllc.co.jp/format/f_bconst.html|title=DVD FLLC - DVD Format Book|website=Dvdfllc.co.jp|accessdate=28 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dvd-books"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dvdfllc.co.jp/format/f_histry.html|title=DVD FLLC - DVD Format Book|website=Dvdfllc.co.jp|accessdate=28 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dvd-books-overview"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mpeg.org/MPEG/DVD/General/Books.html|title=BOOKS OVERVIEW|website=Mpeg.org|accessdate=28 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some specifications for mechanical, physical and optical characteristics of DVD optical discs can be downloaded as freely available standards from the [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] website.&lt;ref name="iso-free"&gt;ISO [http://standards.iso.org/ittf/PubliclyAvailableStandards/index.html ISO Freely Available Standards], Retrieved on 2009-07-24&lt;/ref&gt; There are also equivalent [[European Computer Manufacturers Association]] (Ecma) standards for some of these specifications, such as Ecma-267 for DVD-ROMs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-267.htm|title=Standard ECMA-267|website=Ecma-international.org|accessdate=28 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, the [[DVD+RW Alliance]] publishes competing recordable DVD specifications such as DVD+R, DVD+R DL, DVD+RW or [[DVD+RW DL]].

== DVD recordable and rewritable ==
{{Main|DVD recordable}}
[[File:Sony-Internal-PC-DVD-Drive-Opened.jpg|thumb|right|A DVD burner drive for a PC]]
[[Hewlett-Packard|HP]] initially developed recordable DVD media from the need to store data for backup and transport.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Watson|first=James|title=The recordable DVD clinic|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2001/10/15/the_recordable_dvd_clinic/|publisher=The Register|accessdate=15 October 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;  DVD recordables are now also used for consumer audio and video recording. Three formats were developed: [[DVD-R]]/[[DVD-RW|RW]], [[DVD+R]]/[[DVD+RW|RW]] (plus), and [[DVD-RAM]]. DVD-R is available in two formats, General (650&amp;nbsp;nm) and Authoring (635&amp;nbsp;nm), where Authoring discs may be recorded with [[Content Scramble System|CSS]] encrypted video content but General discs may not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.taperesources.com/dvd_media.html#article2 |title=DVD Media / DVD-R Media |publisher=Tape Resources |date= |accessdate=2011-08-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727112708/http://www.taperesources.com/dvd_media.html |archivedate=2011-07-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although most DVD writers can nowadays write the DVD+R/RW and DVD-R/RW formats (usually denoted by "DVD±RW" or the existence of both the [[DVD Forum]] logo and the DVD+RW Alliance logo), the "plus" and the "dash" formats use different writing specifications. Most DVD readers and players play both kinds of discs, though older models can have trouble with the "plus" variants.

Some first generation [[DVD player]]s would cause damage to DVD±R/RW/DL when attempting to read them.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

The form of the spiral groove that makes up the structure of a recordable DVD encodes unalterable identification data known as [[Media Identification Code]] (MID). The MID contains data such as the manufacturer and model, byte capacity, allowed data rates (also known as speed), etc..{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}

=== Dual-layer recording ===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[DVD-DL]] --&gt;
[[File:Sony DVD+RW.jpg|thumb|Sony Rewritable DVD]]
Dual-layer recording (sometimes also known as double-layer recording) allows [[DVD-R]] and [[DVD+R]] discs to store significantly more data—up to 8.5 [[gigabyte]]s per disc, compared with 4.7 gigabytes for single-layer discs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=DVDs|url=http://www.ncte.ie/documents/advicesheets/06DVDNov08.pdf|publisher=PDST Technology in Education|accessdate=2017-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Along with this, DVD-DLs have slower write speeds as compared to ordinary DVDs. When played, a slight transition can sometimes be seen in the playback when the player changes layers. [[DVD-R DL]] was developed for the [[DVD Forum]] by [[Pioneer Corporation]]; [[DVD+R DL]] was developed for the DVD+RW Alliance by [[Mitsubishi Kagaku Media]] (MKM) and [[Philips]].&lt;ref name="Dual-layer-BurnWorld"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.burnworld.com/howto/articles/intro-to-dual-layer.htm|title=Understanding Dual Layer DVD Recording |publisher=BurnWorld.com |last=DeMoulin |first=Robert |accessdate=2007-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A dual-layer disc differs from its single layered counterpart by employing a second physical layer within the disc itself. The drive with dual-layer capability accesses the second layer by shining the laser through the first semitransparent layer. In some DVD players, the layer change can exhibit a noticeable pause, up to several seconds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hometheaterhifi.com/cgi-bin/shootout.cgi?function=search&amp;articles=all&amp;type=&amp;manufacturer=0&amp;maxprice=0&amp;deInt=0&amp;mpeg=0#SamsungBD-P1000%20Blu-ray/DVD%20Player%20(HDMI) |title=DVD players benchmark |publisher=hometheaterhifi.com |accessdate=2008-04-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080313232626/http://www.hometheaterhifi.com/cgi-bin/shootout.cgi?function=search&amp;articles=all&amp;type=&amp;manufacturer=0&amp;maxprice=0&amp;deInt=0&amp;mpeg=0 |archivedate=March 13, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This caused some viewers to worry that their dual-layer discs were damaged or defective, with the end result that studios began listing a standard message explaining the dual-layer pausing effect on all dual-layer disc packaging.

DVD recordable discs supporting this technology are backward-compatible with some existing DVD players and DVD-ROM drives.&lt;ref name="Dual-layer-BurnWorld" /&gt; Many current [[DVD recorder]]s support dual-layer technology, and the price is now comparable to that of single-layer drives, although the blank media remain more expensive. The recording speeds reached by dual-layer media are still well below those of single-layer media.

Dual layer DVDs are recorded using ''[[Opposite Track Path]]'' (OTP).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://documentation.apple.com/en/dvdstudiopro/usermanual/index.html#chapter=22&amp;section=10&amp;tasks=true|title=DVD Studio Pro 4 User Manual|website=documentation.apple.com|accessdate=28 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  DVD-ROM discs mastered for computer use are produced with track 0 starting at the inside diameter (as is the case with a single layer).  Track 1 then starts at the outside diameter. DVD video discs are mastered slightly differently.  The video is divided between the layers such that layer 1 can be made to start at the same diameter that layer 0 finishes.  This speeds up the transition as the layer changes because although the laser does have to refocus on layer 1, it does not have to skip across the disc to find it.

== Capacity ==
The basic types of DVD (12&amp;nbsp;cm diameter, single-sided or homogeneous double-sided) are referred to by a rough approximation of their capacity in gigabytes. In draft versions of the specification, DVD-5 indeed held five gigabytes, but some parameters were changed later on as explained above, so the capacity decreased. Other [[DVD formats|formats]], those with 8&amp;nbsp;cm diameter and hybrid variants, acquired similar numeric names with even larger deviation.

The 12&amp;nbsp;cm type is a standard DVD, and the 8&amp;nbsp;cm variety is known as a [[MiniDVD]]. These are the same sizes as a standard CD and a [[mini CD|mini-CD]], respectively. The capacity by surface area (MiB/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) varies from 6.92 MiB/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; in the DVD-1 to 18.0 MB/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; in the DVD-18.{{clarify|date=May 2018|reason=is this actually MiB for DVD-18?}}

Each DVD sector contains 2,418 bytes of data, 2,048 bytes of which are user data. There is a small difference in storage space between ''+'' and ''-'' (hyphen) formats:

== DVD drives and players ==
{{See also|Optical disc drive|DVD player}}
DVD drives are devices that can read DVD discs on a computer. [[DVD player]]s are a particular type of devices that do not require a computer to work, and can read [[DVD-Video]] and [[DVD-Audio]] discs.

=== Laser and optics ===
[[File:Comparison CD DVD HDDVD BD.svg|thumb|upright=1.35|Comparison of various optical storage media&lt;!-- parameters: track pitch (p), pit width (w) and minimum length (l), and laser spot size (⌀) and wavelength (λ). --&gt;]]

All three common optical disc media ([[Compact disc]], DVD, and [[Blu-ray]]) use light from [[laser diode]]s, for its spectral purity and ability to be focused precisely.  DVD uses light of 650&amp;nbsp;nm wavelength (red), as opposed to 780&amp;nbsp;nm ([[far-red]], commonly called [[infrared]]) for CD. This shorter wavelength allows a smaller pit on the media surface compared to CDs (0.74&amp;nbsp;µm for DVD versus 1.6&amp;nbsp;µm for CD), accounting in part for DVD's increased storage capacity.

In comparison, [[Blu-ray Disc]], the successor to the DVD format, uses a wavelength of
405&amp;nbsp;nm (violet), and one dual-layer disc has a 50&amp;nbsp;GB storage capacity.

=== Transfer rates ===
[[File:Dismdvd.jpg|thumb|right|Internal mechanism of a DVD-ROM Drive. See text for details.]]

Read and write speeds for the first DVD drives and players were 1,385&amp;nbsp;[[kilobyte|kB]]/s (1,353&amp;nbsp;[[kibibyte|KiB]]/s); this speed is usually called "1×". More recent models, at 18× or 20×, have 18 or 20 times that speed. Note that for CD drives, 1× means 153.6&amp;nbsp;kB/s (150&amp;nbsp;KiB/s), about one-ninth as swift.&lt;ref name="DVD Demystified" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.osta.org/technology/dvdqa/dvdqa4.htm |title=Understanding DVD -Recording Speed |publisher=Osta.org |date= |accessdate=2011-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== DVD-Video ==
{{Main|DVD-Video}}

DVD-Video is a standard for distributing video/audio content on DVD media. The format went on sale in Japan in 1995, in the United States, Canada, Central America, and Indonesia in 1997, and in Europe, Asia, Australia, and Africa in 1998. DVD-Video became the dominant form of home video distribution in Japan when it first went on sale in 1995, but it shared the market for home video distribution in the United States until June 15, 2003, when weekly DVD-Video in the United States rentals began outnumbering weekly VHS cassette rentals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Anna |last=Bakalis |title=It's unreel: DVD rentals overtake videocassettes |work=[[Washington Times]] |date=2003-06-20 |url=http://washingtontimes.com/business/20030620-113258-1104r.htm|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
DVD-Video is still the dominant form of home video distribution worldwide except for in Japan where it was surpassed by [[Blu-ray Disc]] when Blu-ray first went on sale in Japan on March 31, 2006.

{{Main|Content Scramble System}}
The Content Scramble System (CSS) is a [[digital rights management]] (DRM) and [[encryption]] system employed on almost all commercially produced DVD-video discs. CSS utilizes a [[wikt:proprietary|proprietary]] [[40-bit encryption|40-bit]] [[stream cipher]] algorithm. The system was introduced around 1996 and was first compromised in 1999.

The purpose of CSS is twofold:
# CSS prevents byte-for-byte copies of an [[Moving Picture Experts Group|MPEG]] (digital video) stream from being playable since such copies do not include the keys that are hidden on the lead-in area of the restricted DVD.
# CSS provides a reason for manufacturers to make their devices compliant with an industry-controlled standard, since CSS scrambled discs cannot in principle be played on noncompliant devices; anyone wishing to build compliant devices must obtain a license, which contains the requirement that the rest of the DRM system ([[DVD region code|region codes]], [[Macrovision]], and [[user operation prohibition]]) be implemented.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dvd-copy.com/reference/IEEE-doc-copyproc.pdf IEEE - Copy Protection for DVD Video p.2] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090318151452/http://www.dvd-copy.com/reference/IEEE-doc-copyproc.pdf |date=March 18, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While most CSS-decrypting software is used to play DVD videos, other pieces of software (such as [[DVD Decrypter]], [[AnyDVD]], [[DVD43]], Smartripper, and [[DVD Shrink]]) can copy a DVD to a hard drive and remove [[Macrovision]], CSS encryption, [[DVD region code|region codes]] and [[user operation prohibition]].

=== Consumer restrictions ===
The rise of [[filesharing]] has prompted many copyright holders to display notices on DVD [[Optical disc packaging|packaging]] or displayed on screen when the content is played that warn consumers of the illegality of certain uses of the DVD. It is commonplace to include a 90-second advertisement warning that most forms of copying the contents are illegal. Many DVDs prevent skipping past or fast-forwarding through this warning.

&lt;!--
Add text about...
... the DMCA, CSS encryption, and how making backups of one's own purchased video DVDs is illegal because one would be required to violate the DMCA by cracking the CSS encryption on the DVD;
... how this has impacted free DVD playback software on free computer OSes such as Linux (see article on DeCSS);
... consumer protest of the above (by printing CSS cracking software code on t-shirts, for example)
--&gt;
Arrangements for renting and lending differ by geography. In the U.S., the right to re-sell, rent, or lend out bought DVDs is protected by the [[first-sale doctrine]] under the [[Copyright Act of 1976]]. In Europe, rental and lending rights are more limited, under a 1992 European Directive that gives copyright holders broader powers to restrict the commercial renting and public lending of DVD copies of their work. &lt;!-- Add note about the Librarian of Congress's three-year exemption proclamations, and how DVDs have been at the
forefront of the public discussions every time. --&gt;

== DVD-Audio ==
{{Main|DVD-Audio}}

DVD-Audio is a format for delivering high fidelity audio content on a DVD. It offers many channel configuration options (from [[monaural|mono]] to [[5.1 surround sound]]) at various sampling frequencies (up to 24-bits/192&amp;nbsp;kHz versus [[Red Book (CD standard)|CDDA]]'s 16-bits/44.1&amp;nbsp;kHz). Compared with the CD format, the much higher-capacity DVD format enables the inclusion of considerably more music (with respect to total running time and quantity of songs) or far higher audio quality (reflected by higher [[sampling rate]]s, greater sample resolution and additional channels for [[spatial sound]] reproduction).

DVD-Audio briefly formed a niche market, probably due to the very sort of format war with rival standard [[Super Audio CD|SACD]] that [[DVD-Video]] avoided.

=== Security ===
{{Main|Content Protection for Recordable Media}}

DVD-Audio discs employ a [[Digital rights management|DRM]] mechanism, called [[Content Protection for Prerecorded Media]] (CPPM), developed by the 4C group (IBM, Intel, Matsushita, and Toshiba).

Although CPPM was supposed to be much harder to crack than a DVD-Video [[Content Scramble System|CSS]], it too was eventually cracked, in 2007, with the release of the ''dvdcpxm'' tool. The subsequent release of the libdvdcpxm library (based on dvdcpxm) allowed for the development of open source DVD-Audio players and ripping software. As a result, making 1:1 copies of DVD-Audio discs is now possible with relative ease, much like DVD-Video discs.

==Successors and decline==
{{update|date=February 2018}}

In 2006, two new formats called [[HD DVD]] and [[Blu-ray|Blu-ray Disc]] were released as the successor to DVD. HD DVD competed unsuccessfully with Blu-ray Disc in the [[format war]] [[High definition optical disc format war|of 2006–2008]]. A dual layer HD DVD can store up to 30 GB and a dual layer Blu-ray disc can hold up to 50 GB.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=What is Blu-ray Disc? |publisher=Sony |url=http://www.sonystyle.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/CategoryDisplay?catalogId=10551&amp;storeId=10151&amp;langId=-1&amp;identifier=S_BrandShowcase_Blu-ray|accessdate=2008-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=DVD FAQ: 3.13 – What about the new HD formats? |url=http://www.dvddemystified.com/dvdfaq.html#3.13 |accessdate=2008-11-25 |date=2008-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, unlike previous format changes, e.g., vinyl to Compact Disc or VHS videotape to DVD, there is no immediate indication that production of the standard DVD will gradually wind down, as they still dominate, with around 75% of video sales and approximately one billion DVD player sales worldwide {{as of|2011|April|3|lc=y}}. In fact, experts claim that the DVD will remain the dominant medium for at least another five years as Blu-ray technology is still in its introductory phase, write and read speeds being poor and necessary hardware being expensive and not readily available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.movieweb.com/dvd/news/20/26720.php |title=High-Definition Sales Far Behind Standard DVD's First Two Years |publisher=Movieweb.com |date=2008-02-20 |accessdate=2009-08-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080914030503/http://www.movieweb.com/dvd/news/20/26720.php |archivedate=2008-09-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Blu-ray takes 25% Market share:|url=http://www.blu-raystats.com/MarketShare/index.php |accessdate=2011-06-28 |date=2008-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Consumers initially were also slow to adopt Blu-ray due to the cost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Martorana |first=Robert |url=http://seekingalpha.com/article/171207-slow-blu-ray-adoption-a-threat-to-hollywood-s-bottom-line |title=Slow Blu-ray Adoption: A Threat to Hollywood's Bottom Line? |publisher=Seeking Alpha |date=2009-11-04 |accessdate=2011-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2009, 85% of stores were selling Blu-ray Discs. A high-definition television and appropriate connection cables are also required to take advantage of Blu-ray disc. Some analysts suggest that the biggest obstacle to replacing DVD is due to its installed base; a large majority of consumers are satisfied with DVDs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/04_16/b3879008_mz001.htm |title=Gates And Ballmer On "Making The Transition" |work=BusinessWeek |date=2004-04-19 |accessdate=2009-08-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090826072638/http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/04_16/b3879008_mz001.htm |archivedate=2009-08-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The DVD succeeded because it offered a compelling alternative to VHS. In addition, the uniform media size let manufacturers make Blu-ray players and now defunct format HD DVD players [[backward-compatible]], so they can play older DVDs. This stands in contrast to the change from vinyl to CD, and from tape to DVD, which involved a complete change in physical medium. {{As of|2018}} it is still commonplace for studios to issue major releases in "combo pack" format, including both a DVD and a Blu-ray disc (as well as, a digital copy). Also, some multi-disc sets use Blu-ray for the main feature, but DVDs for supplementary features (examples of this include the ''[[Harry Potter]]'' "Ultimate Edition" collections, the 2009 re-release of the 1967 ''[[The Prisoner]]'' TV series, and a 2007 collection related to ''[[Blade Runner]]''). Another reason cited (July 2011) for the slower transition to Blu-ray from DVD is the necessity of and confusion over "firmware updates" and needing an internet connection to perform updates.

This situation is similar to the changeover from [[78 rpm]] shellac recordings to 45 rpm and 33⅓ rpm vinyl recordings. Because the new and old mediums were virtually the same (a disc on a turntable, played by a needle), [[phonograph]] player manufacturers continued to include the ability to play 78s for decades after the format was discontinued.

Manufacturers continue to release standard DVD titles {{as of|2018|lc=y}}, and the format remains the preferred one for the release of older television programs and films. Some programs, such as ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series]]'' and ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'' must be re-scanned to produce a high definition version from the original film recordings. (Certain special effects were also updated to appear better in high-definition.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aintitcool.com/display.cgi?id=24344 |title=Kirk/Spock STAR TREK To Get All-New HD Spaceships |website=Aintitcool.com |accessdate=2009-08-22}}{{Unreliable source?|date=August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

DVDs are also facing competition from [[video on demand]] services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://electronics.howstuffworks.com/are-dvds-becoming-obsolete.htm|title=Are DVDs becoming obsolete?|date=1 November 2014|website=Electronics.howstuffworks.com|accessdate=30 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/forum/movie?_encoding=UTF8&amp;cdForum=Fx2E577OZX17PPI&amp;cdThread=TxQZAH1GWRJW8V|title=Amazon.com: Customer Discussions: When will DVDs be obsolete?|website=Amazon.com|accessdate=30 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://screencrush.com/dvd-sales-decline-study/|title=Is the DVD Becoming Obsolete?|publisher=ScreenCrush|last=Romano|first=Nick|accessdate=30 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cinemablend.com/new/DVD-Going-Way-VHS-2016-43349.html|title=DVD Going The Way Of VHS In 2016  - CINEMABLEND|date=6 June 2014|website=Cinemablend.com|accessdate=30 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; With increasing numbers of homes having high speed Internet connections, many people now have the option to either rent or buy video from an online service, and view it by streaming it directly from that service's servers, meaning that the customer need not have any form of permanent storage media for video at all. PWC predicts that online streaming revenue will overtake physical media sales revenue by 2018. Globally, the total combined revenue from over-the-top (OTT)/streaming services and broadcasters' video on demand (VOD) services is expected to grow at a CAGR of 19.9% to overtake physical home video revenue (the sale and rental of DVDs and Blu-ray discs) in 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pwc.com/gx/en/global-entertainment-media-outlook/segment-insights/filmed-entertainment.jhtml|title=Filmed entertainment segment insights from the Entertainment &amp; Media Outlook: PwC|date=10 December 2012|website=Web.archive.org|accessdate=28 October 2017|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121210211334/http://www.pwc.com/gx/en/global-entertainment-media-outlook/segment-insights/filmed-entertainment.jhtml|archivedate=10 December 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By 2017, digital streaming services had overtaken the sales of DVDs and Blu-rays for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2017/jan/05/film-and-tv-streaming-and-downloads-overtake-dvd-sales-for-first-time-netflix-amazon-uk|title=Film and TV streaming and downloads overtake DVD sales for first time|first=Mark|last=Sweney|date=5 January 2017|accessdate=28 October 2017|website=Theguardian.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Longevity ==
DVD longevity is measured by how long the data remains readable from the disc, assuming compatible devices exist that can read it: that is, how long the disc can be stored until data is lost. Numerous factors affect longevity: composition and quality of the media (recording and substrate layers), humidity and light storage conditions, the quality of the initial recording (which is sometimes a matter of mutual compatibility of media and recorder), etc.&lt;ref name="NIST-final"/&gt; According to [[NIST]], "[a] temperature of 64.4&amp;nbsp;°F (18&amp;nbsp;°C) and 40% RH [Relative Humidity] would be considered suitable for long-term storage. A lower temperature and RH is recommended for extended-term storage."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Wo|last=Chang |url=http://www.itl.nist.gov/iad/894.05/docs/disccare.html |title=NIST Digital Media Group: docs/disccare |publisher=National Institute of Standards and Technology |date=2007-08-21 |accessdate=2013-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[Optical Storage Technology Association]] (OSTA), "Manufacturers claim lifespans ranging from 30 to 100 years for DVD, DVD-R and DVD+R discs and up to 30 years for DVD-RW, DVD+RW and DVD-RAM."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.osta.org/technology/dvdqa/dvdqa11.htm|title=Understanding DVD - Disc Longevity|website=Osta.org|accessdate=28 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a NIST/[[Library of Congress|LoC]] research project conducted in 2005–2007 using [[accelerated life testing]], "There were fifteen DVD products tested, including five DVD-R, five DVD+R, two DVD-RW and three DVD+RW types. There were ninety samples tested for each product. [...] Overall, seven of the products tested had estimated life expectancies in ambient conditions of more than 45 years. Four products had estimated life expectancies of 30–45 years in ambient storage conditions. Two products had an estimated life expectancy of 15–30 years and two products had estimated life expectancies of less than 15 years when stored in ambient conditions." The life expectancies for 95% survival estimated in this project by type of product are tabulated below:&lt;ref name="NIST-final"&gt;[https://www.loc.gov/preservation/resources/rt/NIST_LC_OpticalDiscLongevity.pdf Final Report: NIST/Library of Congress (LC) Optical Disc Longevity Study], Loc.gov, September 2007 (table derived from figure 7)&lt;/ref&gt;{{dubious|DVD lifetime|date=December 2013}}

A '''Dear Colleague letter''' is a letter sent by one member of a [[legislative body]] to all fellow members, usually describing a new bill and asking for cosponsors or seeking to influence the recipients' votes on an issue. They can also be used for administrative matters, such as announcing elevator repairs, or informing colleagues of events connected with congressional business, or to set or modify procedures.

== Description ==

A typical "Dear Colleague letter" is written by staff members and will be approved by a Legislative Director as it represents a significant political communication by the member. Dear Colleague letters are short, typically no longer than 500 words.

== Use ==

The use of such letters dates back to at least to the early 20th century. Electronic Dear Colleague letters are now disseminated via in-house networks in the [[US House]] and [[US Senate]].&lt;ref&gt;“Dear Colleague” Letters: A Brief Overview, R. Eric Peterson, Jan. 4, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Several agencies of the US government have also made use of "Dear Colleague" letters to disseminate information to the public and issue statements on public policy, including those of the [[United States Department of Transportation|Department of Transportation]], the [[Department of Health and Human Services]], and the [[United States Department of Education|Department of Education]].&lt;ref name = "dhhs"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.acf.hhs.gov/ocs/resource/csbg-dear-colleague-state-plan-revisions-second-open-comment-period|title=CSBG Dear Colleague State Plan Revisions: Second Open Comment Period|work=Office of Community Services {{!}} ACF|access-date=2018-07-20|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "doe"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ifap.ed.gov/ifap/byYear.jsp?type=dpcletters&amp;year=2018|title=Federal Student Aid - IFAP: iLibrary - Dear Colleague Letters|last=|first=|date=2018|website=Federal Student Aid|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "dot"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.transit.dot.gov/regulations-and-guidance/policy-letters/dear-colleague-letter-risk-based-reporting-policy|title=Dear Colleague Letter on Risk-Based Reporting Policy|date=2017-10-20|work=FTA|access-date=2018-07-20|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[UK government]] agencies such as the [[U.K. Department of Health]], Dear Colleague letters convey general information, policy updates or a request for information or action.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dh.gov.uk/en/Publicationsandstatistics/Lettersandcirculars/Dearcolleagueletters/index.htm Dear Colleague Letters], UK Dept of Health&lt;/ref&gt;

The proposed tax is a [[Destination principle|destination-based]], [[border-adjustment tax|border-adjustable]] [[international taxation|international]] [[Corporate tax|corporate]] [[consumption tax]] system in which a tax is "applied to all [[domestic consumption]] and excludes any goods or services that are produced domestically, but consumed elsewhere."&lt;ref name="TF_DBCFT_explained" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/border-adjustment-tax.asp|title=Border Adjustment Tax|last=Parker|first=Tim|date=January 6, 2017|newspaper=Investopedia|access-date=February 13, 2017|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The border adjustments included in the proposal are "taxes or tax reductions that apply when payments for goods and services cross international borders."&lt;ref name="AAF_Auerbach_2017_borderadjustments" /&gt;  Imported goods purchased/consumed domestically are subject to the tax while goods produced domestically and sold internationally are exempt.&lt;ref name="Brookings_2017_guide" /&gt;

According to economist [[Alan J. Auerbach]] at the [[University of California, Berkeley]], who is the "principal intellectual champion" of the "package of ideas" surrounding border-adjustment tax that had been evolving in academia over a number of years,&lt;ref name="NYT_Auerbach_BAT_2017" /&gt; the destination-based system, which is focused on where a product is consumed, eliminates incentives that [[Multinational corporation|multinationals]] now have to "game the system" through [[tax inversion]] and other means, in order to "avoid taxes" and to "shelter profits" by "shifting" "intangible assets to low-tax nations."&lt;ref name="NYT_Auerbach_BAT_2017" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Forbes-Pfizer ends bid"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/erikamorphy/2014/05/26/pfizer-abandons-astrazeneca-bid-but-its-tax-issues-live-on/|title=Pfizer Ends AstraZeneca Bid But The Tax Issues It Raised Live On|work=[[Forbes]]|date=May 26, 2014 |quote= for example when [[Pfizer]] proposed to invert to the UK through a takeover of [[AstraZeneca]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Levin_2014_inversions"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2014/07/21/how-can-the-us-stop-corporate-tax-flight/inversions-highlight-unfairness-of-the-tax-code|title=Inversions Highlight Unfairness of the Tax Code|author=[[Sander Levin]]|work=[[New York Times]]|date=July 22, 2014 |accessdate=February 18, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Introducing this is the linchpin of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]]'s 2016 tax-reform proposal.&lt;ref name="GOP_BluePrintBetterWay_2016" /&gt;{{rp|27}} A major aspect of the tax policy change would result in lowering the [[corporate tax]] rate from 35% to 20% by adjusting or removing [[export]] sales from the company's [[Taxable profit|taxable revenue]], thus leaving large, profitable multinational corporations at a very substantial tax advantage.&lt;ref name="Forbes_BAT_Nitti" /&gt; As that would result in a sizable loss in tax revenue,&lt;ref name="Forbes_BAT_Nitti" /&gt; the border-adjustment tax applied to [[import]]s consumed domestically is essential to compensate for the loss.&lt;ref name="Forbes_BAT_Nitti" /&gt; Auerbach's theory is that a border-adjustment tax of 20% would strengthen the [[US dollar]] by about 25%. More exports will assumedly be sold because of their lower costs under the border tax subsidy. The stronger dollar would keep domestic consumer costs lower in spite of the 20% corporate income tax being applied to imported goods consumed domestically, effectively cancelling out the higher tax on imports and making the border-adjustment tax value-neutral.&lt;ref name="Cotton_BAT_2017" /&gt;

However, both ''[[The Economist]]'' and the [[Brookings Institution]] caution that there is uncertainty as to how the [[Currency exchange rate|currency exchange]] will respond.

== History ==
Over the years, Auerbach has worked with [[Michael Devereux]], who had co-introduced with [[Stephen R. Bond]], the term destination-based corporate tax. Auerbach described a "corporate tax system" in which the "incentives" would be aligned with the "national interest."&lt;ref name="NYT_Auerbach_BAT_2017" /&gt; In designing a "destination-based system, focusing on where a product is consumed", Auerbach wanted to eliminate incentives that multinationals now have to "game the system" in order to "avoid taxes" and to "shelter profits" by "shifting" "intangible assets to low-tax nations."&lt;ref name="NYT_Auerbach_BAT_2017" /&gt; As early as 1997, Auerbach mentioned the concept in a 1997 article published in the ''[[American Economic Review]]''.&lt;ref name="jstor_auerbach_BAT_1997"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Auerbach|first=Alan J.|date=January 1, 1997|title=The Future of Fundamental Tax Reform|jstor=2950901|journal=''[[The American Economic Review]]''|volume=87|issue=2|pages=143–146}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT_Auerbach_BAT_2017"&gt;{{citation |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/12/business/economy/new-approach-to-corporate-tax-reform.html?_r=0|title=New Approach to Corporate Tax Law Has House G.O.P.

== Context ==
In the United States, 14 more corporate [[tax inversion|inversions]] were reported in 2014 alone in a wave of inversions that threatened to "undermine the U.S. tax base" and economy", according to [[Sander Levin]], (D-Michigan), then-leader of the [[United States House Committee on Ways and Means|Ways and Means Committee]].&lt;ref name="Levin_2014_inversions" /&gt; Auerbach had promoted his tax policies within government agencies for many years, but it was in 2016 that [[Kevin Brady]] (R-Texas), Ways and Means Committee Chairman included most of Auerbach's recommendations in his blueprint. Brady, who was leader of the Tax Reform Task Force, one of six task forces created by House Speaker [[Paul D. Ryan]] on February 4, 2016, spearheaded the [[Republican Party (United States)|GOP]] effort to "create a 21st century tax code built for growth." On June 24, they presented a policy paper, entitled "A Better Way: Our Vision for a Confident America", which promoted a move to "a destination-basis tax system."&lt;ref name="GOP_BluePrintBetterWay_2016" /&gt;{{rp|27}} The paper, which is part of a "series of "blueprint" white papers" that outline major policy changes",&lt;ref name="Forbes_BAT_2017_Ellis" /&gt; described how the proposed "territorial tax system" would end the United States' existing "uncompetitive worldwide tax approach."&lt;ref name="GOP_BluePrintBetterWay_2016" /&gt; {{rp|27}} The blueprint would also cut "the corporate tax rate to 20 percent from 35 percent" so the border tax is needed as revenue offset.&lt;ref name="CNBC_debate_BAT_2017" /&gt; In a February 17, 2017 interview with ''Bloomberg'', Brady described the "centerpiece of Ryan’s tax blueprint"&lt;ref name="Bloomberg_Koch_BAT_2017" /&gt; the GOP as an "idea to tax imports and exempt exports would make U.S. companies more competitive globally and reduce their current motivations to move abroad."&lt;ref name="Bloomberg_Brady_BAT_2017"&gt;{{citation |url=https://www.bna.com/rep-kevin-brady-m57982083471 |title=Rep.

== Current corporate tax system ==
Some{{Weasel words inline|date=April 2017}} argue that the [[Corporate tax in the United States|U.S. corporate tax]] rate at 35% is the "highest in the [[industrialized world]]", while others{{Weasel words inline|date=April 2017}} argue it isn't. The rate varies from sector to sector, and can be as low as 21% in the manufacturing industry.&lt;ref name="Forbes_BAT_Nitti" /&gt; A high tax rate would place the U.S. at a "competitive disadvantage in the global marketplace." and encourages corporations to move to countries with lower taxes.&lt;ref name="Forbes_BAT_Nitti" /&gt; The current tax system also provides a "tax deduction for imported goods", providing another incentive for companies to leave. Companies that import inventory before ultimately selling their product domestically to U.S. consumers can deduct the cost of imports from their taxable income as part of cost of goods sold giving the company a sometimes sizable benefit.&lt;ref name="Forbes_BAT_Nitti" /&gt; As explained in ''[[Forbes]],'' the border-adjustment tax "would move away from a direct income tax, and more toward an indirect "[[cash flow]]" tax" where a "corporation would be entitled to immediately deduct the cost of all asset purchases." and the "corporate tax rate would be reduced to 20%.&lt;ref name="Forbes_BAT_Nitti" /&gt; Although this is being compared to a [[Value-added tax|value added tax]] (VAT), "under a typical VAT...the corporation couldn't deduct its [[wage]]s."&lt;ref name="Forbes_BAT_Nitti" /&gt; but under the Brady and Ryan blueprint, wages could be deducted so this would be an "indirect VAT."&lt;ref name="Forbes_BAT_Nitti" /&gt;

{{quote|Under current law, the  U.S. has a true "income tax," which is a direct tax on [.] the income of a corporation... but not on the total income. [T]he corporation is permitted to deduct both the cost of any goods sold -- whether produced or purchased for resale -- and general and administrative expenses like wages, advertising, interest expense, depreciation, etc... Once you've settled onto that net income number, a 35% income tax is assessed.|Nitti January 26, 2017. ''Forbes''}}

A sizable loss in tax revenue will be one of the results of a 15% corporate tax rate reduction.&lt;ref name="Forbes_BAT_Nitti" /&gt;

To encourage companies to export, the border adjustment tax system would "adjust" the company's tax to account for the exported sales by removing the amount of the export sales from the company's revenue number, leaving large, profitable multi-national corporations at a very substantial tax advantage.&lt;ref name="Forbes_BAT_Nitti" /&gt;

{{quote|Firms currently pay corporate taxes on their profits. Border-adjustment would change how those profits are calculated.

== Comparison to value-added tax ==
[[File:Counties with VAT tax.jpeg|400px|thumbnail|right|VAT taxes act as a tariff on imports and their exports are exempt from the VAT ([[Zero-rated supply|Zero-rated).]] ]]

Except for the United States, all [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|OECD]] countries employ some form of [[Value-added tax|value-added tax (VAT)]] as do 160 other [[List of sovereign states|countries]].&lt;ref name="OECD 2014 VAT trends"&gt;{{cite book|title=Consumption Tax Trends 2014: VAT/GST and excise rates, trends and policy issues|date=2014|publisher=Secretary-General of the OECD|isbn=978-92-64-22394-3|url=http://www.keepeek.com/Digital-Asset-Management/oecd/taxation/consumption-tax-trends-2014_ctt-2014-en#.V-bNg61v9GY#page1|accessdate=September 24, 2016|doi=10.1787/ctt-2014-en}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|14}}

In the US, the concept of a value-added tax has been the subject of much debate in academia and in politics, and a business "flat tax", or a national subtraction-method VAT, was among the proposals put forward to replace the corporate income tax in 2008.&lt;ref name="CRS 2008"&gt;{{cite report |first=James M. |last=Bickley |date=3 January 2008 |title=Value-Added Tax: A New U.S. Revenue Source? |url=https://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/RL33619.pdf |publisher=[[Congressional Research Service]] |pages=1, 3 |docket=RL33619 |access-date=September 24, 2016 |dead-url=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160628205051/http://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/RL33619.pdf |archivedate=June 28, 2016 |quote= |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cruz Flat Tax"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cole|first1=Alan|title=Ted Cruz’s "Business Flat Tax:" A Primer|url=http://taxfoundation.org/blog/ted-cruz-s-business-flat-tax-primer|website=Tax Policy Blog|publisher=Tax Foundation|accessdate=September 24, 2016|date=October 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="USCC VAT white paper"&gt;{{cite report |first=Philip |last=Beram |title=An Introduction to the Value Added Tax (VAT)|url=https://www.uschamber.com/sites/default/files/legacy/issues/econtax/files/vat_paper_4_25_2010.pdf |publisher=[[United States Chamber of Commerce]] |pages= |access-date=September 24, 2016 |dead-url=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160924201658/https://www.uschamber.com/sites/default/files/legacy/issues/econtax/files/vat_paper_4_25_2010.pdf |archivedate=September 24, 2016 |quote= |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to an article co-authored by Auerbach for the [[American Action Forum]],&lt;ref name="AAF_Auerbach_2017_borderadjustments"&gt;{{citation |url=https://www.americanactionforum.org/research/14344/ |title=The Role of Border Adjustments in International Taxation |author1=Alan J.

Caroline Freund, a senior fellow at the [[Peterson Institute for International Economics]], described how the "Better Way" plan incorporates "border-tax adjustments into business taxes." It makes "exports tax-exempt, while companies could not deduct expenditures on imports from their tax base." She compared the border-adjustment tax proposed by the GOP in 2016 to the [[value-added tax]] (VAT) that many other countries use. The former is a business tax while the latter is a sales tax; the former is [[Protectionism|protectionist]] and the VAT, like a sales tax, is not. Freund uses the example of Maryland's 6% sales tax, which applies to all imports regardless of where they are produced. It is not a destination-based consumption tax, therefore it is neither protectionist nor discriminatory unlike the proposed DBCFT.&lt;ref name="Bloomberg_2017_Freund" /&gt; The destination-based cash-flow tax (or DBCFT) allows for wage deductions, while a VAT does not.&lt;ref name="Bloomberg_2017_Freund" /&gt;

Under the cash-flow tax with border adjustment, imports would be charged a uniform 20% and unlike "the sales tax, the cash-flow tax with border adjustment would favor domestically produced goods."&lt;ref name="Bloomberg_2017_Freund" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Commodity tax competition and industry location under the destination and the origin principle |author1=Kristian Behrens|author2=Jonathan H.

The [[origin principle]], when compared to the [[destination principle]], is shown to exacerbate [[tax competition]] and to erode tax revenues, yet gives rise to a more equal spatial distribution of economic activity. This suggests that federations which care about spatial inequality, like the [[European Union]], face a non-trivial choice for their tax principle that goes beyond the standard considerations of [[tax revenue distribution]].}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== How it would work ==
{{quote|Firms currently pay corporate taxes on their profits. Border-adjustment would change how those profits are calculated. Accountants could no longer deduct imports—say, goods brought in from China—as costs. And their exports would no longer count as revenues. For tax purposes, "profits" would be domestic sales minus domestic costs. Effectively, imports would be taxed, and exports would be subsidised. As a result, retailers, who stock their shelves with imported wares, are lobbying against the change. Exporters, such as the aerospace industry, broadly support it.|''The Economist'' February 13, 2017}}

By February 17, 2017 under the [[U.S. Tax Code|Tax Code]], if a corporation produces a product domestically and sells it internationally, the company must pay income taxes to the US on the sale. However, if a corporation imports a product that is manufactured internationally and sells it domestically, the company does not pay income taxes to the US on the value of the imported product.&lt;ref name="Brookings_2017_guide" /&gt;

In theory, a border-adjustment tax is trade-neutral: the stronger domestic currency would make exports more expensive internationally, lowering demand for exported products while reducing the costs incurred by domestic firms in purchasing goods and services in foreign markets, helping importers. Thus, the anticipated strengthening of the domestic currency effectively neutralizes the border-adjustment tax, resulting in a trade-neutral outcome.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} Auerbach's theory is that a border-adjustment tax would strengthen the dollar by an amount corresponding to the tax and the stronger dollar would theoretically reduce the price of imported goods, effectively cancelling out the higher tax on imports and making the border-adjustment tax value neutral.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

''The Economist'' warns that in reality, "Nobody knows for sure what would happen.... If the economy failed to adjust, importers would pay a lot more tax, and exporters would get a windfall. Any adjustment would be painful. To offset a border-adjusted tax of 20%—the rate favoured by House Republicans—the greenback would need to rise fully 25%, enough to destabilise emerging markets burdened with dollar-denominated debts."&lt;ref name="Economist_howitworks_BAT_2017" /&gt; However, the Brookings Institution also caution, "If the exchange rate does not adjust fully and immediately, though, the effects of the border adjustment could be quite different. Exports would rise, imports would fall, and the trade deficit would fall. Consumer prices would rise, fueled by higher import costs, and this would hit low-income households disproportionately."&lt;ref name="Brookings_2017_guide" /&gt;

== Advantages ==
According to the [[Tax Foundation]], there are several advantages to implementing a border-adjustment tax&lt;ref name="taxfoundation_FAQ_BAT_2017"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://taxfoundation.org/faqs-border-adjustment/#2|title=FAQs about the Border Adjustment – Tax Foundation|date=January 30, 2017|newspaper=Tax Foundation|access-date=February 13, 2017|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; It would "raise revenue in the least distortive manner in order to lower overall rates for U.S. taxpayers." It would "raise $1.1 trillion over 10 years" and "lower the corporate income tax rate from 35 percent to 20 percent." It would "protect the U.S. tax base by improving business incentives" by "changing the system from taxing companies based on where they produce to based on where they sell." It would "simplify the business tax system" by replacing "most of these complicated international tax rules."&lt;ref name="taxfoundation_FAQ_BAT_2017" /&gt; Additionally, by exempting foreign transactions from taxation (i.e. levying a tax on goods produced domestically but sold internationally), the DBCFT removes a strong incentive for firms to relocate (or off-shore) profits or profitable activities. The burden of the tax would be borne, primarily, by individuals and businesses who own foreign (non-domestic) assets.&lt;ref name="taxfoundation_FAQ_BAT_2017" /&gt;

=== Border-adjustment tax and US corporations ===
Border-adjustment taxes would eliminate incentives that drive US corporations to "shift profit overseas and overcharge for purchases from subsidiaries abroad."&lt;ref name="Bloomberg_2017_Freund" /&gt; For example, [[Apple Inc]] has been [[Investigation of Apple's transfer pricing arrangements with Ireland|criticized]] for allegedly [[Double Irish arrangement|gaming]] the existing tax system.&lt;ref name="Bloomberg_2017_Freund" /&gt;

== Disadvantages ==

Those who oppose the border-adjustment tax have concerns about the impact on the US dollar exchange rate, which would benefit countries like China and Japan that hold a large portion of the US debt, retaliations by trade partners, legal challenges through the [[World Trade Organization]], and benefits to larger American corporations that export at the cost of smaller and medium-sized domestic companies that import, and therefore their customers, especially middle- and lower-income American consumers.

=== Changes in exchange rate ===
{{quote|If the exchange rate does not adjust fully and immediately, though, the effects of the border adjustment could be quite different. Exports would rise, imports would fall, and the trade deficit would fall. Consumer prices would rise, fueled by higher import costs, and this would hit low-income households disproportionately.|Brookings Guide 2017}}

"If the dollar goes up 25%, U.S. holders of foreign assets—including pension funds and endowments—would suffer a one-time loss in wealth of more than $2 trillion."&lt;ref name="WSJ_for_against_BAT_2017" /&gt;

According to ''[[The Washington Post]]'', as foreign exchange rates adjust to the border adjustment tax by increasing the value of the dollar, as predicted by some Republicans and many economists, an "underappreciated effect" of a [[strong dollar policy|strong dollar]] would be the increase in the value of "dollar-denominated U.S. debt held by foreigners" such as the Chinese government.&lt;ref name="WP_makechinagreat_2017"&gt;{{citation |title=Trump is working hard to Make China Great Again |publisher=''[[The Washington Post]]'' |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2017/02/16/64e31d98-f48e-11e6-b9c9-e83fce42fb61_story.html|date=February 17, 2017 |accessdate=February 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== WTO challenges ===
The [[European Union]] and other trading partners could challenge border-adjustment tax with the World Trade Organization.&lt;ref name="CNBC_debate_BAT_2017" /&gt; In its current iteration, it could be non-compatible, as rules state that imported goods be treated the same as domestically-produced goods. The DBCFT, however, taxes the entire value of the import but only the above-normal return to capital owners of domestically-produced goods. According to an January 18, 2017 article in ''[[Bloomberg News|Bloomberg View]]'', while it has been asserted that the proposed border-adjustment tax would be compatible with WTO rules, that is controversial. The proposed tax could disfavor imports over domestically produced goods. The wage component of goods that are produced domestically would not be taxed.&lt;ref name="Bloomberg_2017_Freund"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Freund|first1=Caroline|title=Trump Is Right: 'Border Adjustment' Tax Is Complicated| url=https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2017-01-18/trump-is-right-border-adjustment-tax-is-complicated|accessdate=January 19, 2017|work=Bloomberg View|date=January 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Disproportionately impacted ===
Critics have argued that a border-adjustment tax may disproportionately and adversely impact domestic companies that import products or parts, such as those in the retail, clothing, shoes, automotive, consumer electronics, and oil industries while favoring large, domestic exporters, such as those in the aerospace, defense or technology sectors. Industrial multinational companies who are exporters, such as [[Dow Chemical Co.]], [[Pfizer]], [[General Electric]] and [[Boeing]], support the levy.&lt;ref name="CNBC_debate_BAT_2017" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Economist_howitworks_BAT_2017"&gt;{{citation |url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/economist-explains/2017/02/economist-explains-9?fsrc=scn/tw/te/bl/ed/ |title=How America’s border-adjusted corporate tax would work: The plan was drawn up before Donald Trump was nominated as the Republican presidential candidate |quote=Firms currently pay corporate taxes on their profits. Border-adjustment would change how those profits are calculated. Accountants could no longer deduct imports—say, goods brought in from China—as costs. And their exports would no longer count as revenues. For tax purposes, "profits" would be domestic sales minus domestic costs. Effectively, imports would be taxed, and exports would be subsidised. As a result, retailers, who stock their shelves with imported wares, are lobbying against the change. Exporters, such as the aerospace industry, broadly support it. |publisher=''The Economist''|date=February 13, 2017 |accessdate=February 17, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bloomberg_Koch_BAT_2017" /&gt; Along with Koch Industries, those who oppose it include oil refiners, car dealers, represented by [[American International Automobile Dealers Association]] including Toyota Motor Corp, toy manufacturers, retailers&lt;ref name="WSJ_for_against_BAT_2017"&gt;{{citation |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/gop-plan-to-overhaul-tax-code-gets-held-up-at-the-border-1486485339|author=Richard Rubin |title=GOP Plan to Overhaul Tax Code Gets Held Up at the Border: Linchpin of potential legislation is a concept known as ‘border adjustment,’ which is splitting the business world into competing camps|publisher=''The Wall Street Journal''|date=February 7, 2017 |accessdate=February 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as [[Target Corporation]], [[Gap Inc.]], Nike Inc., McCormick &amp; Co., and [[Walmart]], which depend on "importing foreign-made goods."&lt;ref name="CNBC_debate_BAT_2017" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bloomberg_Koch_BAT_2017" /&gt;&lt;ref name="WSJ_debate_BAT_2017"&gt;{{citation |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/as-tax-debate-heats-up-lawmakers-struggle-to-think-of-a-plan-b-1487327400|author=Richard Rubin |title=As Tax Debate Heats Up, Lawmakers Struggle to Think of a Plan B: Border adjustment faces widespread criticism, but finding alternatives proves a tall order|publisher=''The Wall Street Journal''|date=February 17, 2017 |accessdate=February 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; They claim that "it would drive up import costs and force them to raise prices."&lt;ref name="WSJ_for_against_BAT_2017" /&gt;

The '''Federal Accountability Initiative for Reform''' (FAIR) was a Canadian public interest organization and registered [[Charitable organization|charity]] whose purpose was to support legislation and management practices that protect whistleblowers.

==Mission statement==

FAIR's mission was to promote "integrity and accountability within government by empowering employees to speak out without fear of reprisal when they encounter wrongdoing" and to "support legislation and management practices that will provide effective protection for whistleblowers and hence occupational free speech in the workplace."&lt;ref&gt;[http://fairwhistleblower.ca/ FAIR Website]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and impact==
FAIR was founded in 1998 by Joanna Gualtieri, a well-known whistleblower and a leading authority on Canadian whistleblower law. Under her leadership the organization played a key role in the shaping of Canadian legislation on whistleblowing and [[accountability]] issues.  It drafted the first Federal whistleblower protection legislation brought before the [[Parliament in Canada]], which was introduced as a private members bill. It also provided testimony to the [[Standing committee (Canada)|House Standing Legislative Committee]] and [[Canadian Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs]] on May 10 and September 25, 2006&lt;ref&gt;[http://cmte.parl.gc.ca/cmte/CommitteePublication.aspx?SourceId=143679 May 10, 2006 Proceedings of the Legislative  Committee on Bill C-2] and [http://www.parl.gc.ca/39/1/parlbus/commbus/senate/Com-e/lega-e/09evb-e.htm?Language=E&amp;Parl=39&amp;Ses=1&amp;comm_id=11 September 25, 2006 Proceedings of the Standing Senate Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs]&lt;/ref&gt; in advance of the passing of the ''Public Servants Disclosure Protection Act''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lois.justice.gc.ca/en/ShowTdm/cs/P-31.9///en Public Servants Disclosure Protection Act]&lt;/ref&gt; The organization has apparently ceased operation.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1478">{{Politics of Germany}}The '''Federal Fiscal Court''' (''Bundesfinanzhof'') is one of [[Federal courts (Germany)|five federal supreme courts]] of [[Germany]], established according to Article 95 of the [[Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany|Basic Law]]. It is the federal court of appeal for tax and customs matters in cases which have already been heard by the subordinate instance, namely the [[Finance Court (Germany)|Finance Courts]].

The ''Federal Fiscal Court''  was established in 1950 (succeeding the supreme Finance Court of the German Reich - ''Reichsfinanzhof'' - established in 1918). Its seat is in [[Munich]].

The '''Insolvent Debtors (England) Act''' (53 Geo. 3 c 102) was an [[Act of Parliament]] passed by the [[United Kingdom Parliament]] in 1813, during the reign of [[King George III of the United Kingdom|King George III]].

It was enacted in response to the demands on the prison system imposed by the numbers of those being incarcerated for debt, and some concern for their plight. The Act created a new Court for the Relief of Insolvent Debtors that remained in existence until 1861, under the jurisdiction of a newly appointed Commissioner. Those imprisoned for debt could apply to the court to be released&amp;nbsp;– unless they were in trade or guilty of fraudulent or other dishonest behaviour&amp;nbsp;– by reaching an agreement with their [[creditor]]s that ensured a fair distribution of their present and future assets.{{r|NationalArchives}}

'''''Intelligent Governance for the 21st Century: A Middle Way Between West and East''''' is a book published in 2012 by the investor and philanthropist [[Nicolas Berggruen]] and the editor and writer Nathan Gardels.

It argues that Western democracies have become stymied by populism and short-term thinking, while authoritarian Eastern nations, notably China, need to bolster their meritocratic but authoritarian systems with the popular legitimacy characteristic of Western polities.

The book was first published in English and later translated into Spanish, Portuguese and other languages.

==Contents==
*Chapter 1: "[[Globalization]] and the Challenges to Good [[Governance]]" contrasts the geopolitical and geo-civilizational outlooks of West and East as they face the transition underway from American-led globalization to an interdependence of plural identities.
*Chapter 2: "America's Consumer Democracy versus China's Modern Mandarinate" analyzes the contemporary strengths and deficiencies of both systems.
*Chapter 3: "Liberal Democratic Constitutionalism and [[Meritocracy]]: Hybrid Possibilities" revisits debates over the qualities of political meritocracy versus electoral democracy as forms of good governance. In particular, it examines affinities of Western classical and [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] thinkers with Confucian precepts.
*Chapter 4: "The New Challenges for Governance: Social Networks, Megacities, and the Global Scattering of Productive Capabilities" brings older governance debates into the 21st century.
*Chapter 5: "Intelligent Governance: Tenets and Template" is an exercise in political imagination that proposes an institutional design for a middle way between West and East.
*Chapter 6: "Rebooting California's Dysfunctional Democracy" describes the [[Berggruen Institute on Governance]]'s work to find ways for of the American state of [[California]] to redesign its government in order to escape from legislative gridlock and chronic fiscal weakness.
*Chapter 7: "The [[G-20]]: Global Governance from Summits to Subnational Networks" shows the Berggruen Institute on Governance's efforts to make the Group of 20 more effective.
*Chapter 8: "Europe: Political Union and the Democratic Deficit" describes how the Berggruen Institute on Governance has encouraged the [[European Union]] toward closer political and fiscal unity.

The book's conclusion, "Survival of the Wisest", argues that wisdom and long-term thinking combined to democratic legitimacy is the right political combination for success in a globalized world.

The '''International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance''' (ICPPED)  is an [[International human rights instruments|international human rights instrument]] of the [[United Nations]] and intended to prevent [[forced disappearance]] defined in international law, [[crimes against humanity]].&lt;ref&gt;Preamble&lt;/ref&gt; The text was adopted by the [[United Nations General Assembly]] on 20 December 2006 and opened for signature on 6 February 2007. It entered into force on 23 December 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/WO1011/S00559/iraq-paves-way-for-un-treaty-on-enforced-disappearance.htm |title=Iraq Paves Way for UN Treaty on Enforced Disappearance |publisher=United Nations |date=2010-11-25 |accessdate=2010-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{as of|2018|September}}, 97 states have signed the convention and 59 have ratified it.&lt;ref name=parties&gt;{{cite web |url=https://treaties.un.org/pages/ViewDetails.aspx?src=IND&amp;mtdsg_no=IV-16&amp;chapter=4&amp;clang=_en |title=International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance  |publisher=UNTC |accessdate=2010-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Genesis ==
Following a General Assembly resolution in 1992 containing a 21 article declaration about enforced disappearance,&lt;ref name="UN_ARES47133"&gt;{{UN document |docid=A-RES-47-133 |type=Resolution |body=General Assembly |session=47 |resolution_number=133 |accessdate=2008-02-14 | title=Declaration on the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance| date=18 December 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; and its resolution of 1978 requesting that recommendations be made,&lt;ref name="UN_ARES33173"&gt;{{UN document |docid=A-RES-33-173 |type=Resolution |body=General Assembly |session=33 |resolution_number=173 |accessdate=2008-02-14| title=Disappeared Persons|date=20 December 1978}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Commission on Human Rights]] established an "inter-sessional open-ended working group to elaborate a draft legally binding normative instrument for the protection of all persons from enforced disappearance" in 2001.&lt;ref name="UN_A6153_page13"&gt;{{UN document |docid=A-61-53 |type=Document |body=General Assembly |session=61 |document_number=53 |page=13 |accessdate=2008-02-14| title=Report of the Human Rights Council - First and second special sessions| year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Group concluded its work in 2006 and its draft international convention was adopted by the [[Human Rights Council]] on 29 June 2006, and welcomed the offer by France to host the signing ceremony.&lt;ref name="UN_A6153_page13"/&gt;

On 20 December 2006, the General Assembly adopted without a vote the text of the Convention and opened it for signature at the signing ceremony in Paris.&lt;ref&gt;{{ UN document |docid=A-61-PV.82 |body=General Assembly |type=Verbotim Report |session=61 |meeting=82 |page=1 |anchor=pg001-bk02 |date=20 December 2006 |accessdate=2008-02-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Summary ==

The convention is modelled heavily on the [[United Nations Convention Against Torture]].

"Enforced disappearance" is defined in Article 2 of the Convention as

:''the arrest, detention, [[kidnapping|abduction]] or any other form of deprivation of liberty by agents of the State or by persons or groups of persons acting with the authorization, support or acquiescence of the State, followed by a refusal to acknowledge the deprivation of liberty or by concealment of the fate or whereabouts of the disappeared person, which place such a person outside the protection of the law.''

Article 1 of the Convention further states that

:''No exceptional circumstances whatsoever, whether a state of war or a threat of war, internal political instability or any other public emergency, may be invoked as a justification for enforced disappearance.''

The widespread or systematic use of enforced disappearance is further defined as a crime against humanity in Article 6.

Parties to the convention undertake to:

* investigate acts of enforced disappearance and bring those responsible to justice;
* ensure that enforced disappearance constitutes an offence under its [[criminal law]];
* establish jurisdiction over the offence of enforced disappearance when the alleged offender is within its territory, even if they are not a citizen or resident;
* cooperate with other states in ensuring that offenders are prosecuted or extradited, and to assist the victims of enforced disappearance or locate and return their remains;
* respect minimum legal standards around the deprivation of liberty, including the right for imprisonment to be challenged before the courts;
* establish a register of those currently imprisoned, and allow it to be inspected by relatives and counsel;
* ensure that victims of enforced disappearance or those directly affected by it have a right to obtain reparation and compensation. (Article 24. 4)
* the right to obtain reparation covers material and dangers and, where appropriate, other forms of reparation such as; a) [[Restitution]]. b) [[Psychiatric rehabilitation|Rehabilitation]]. c) Satisfication, including restoration of dignity and [[reparation (legal)|reparation]]. d) Guarantee of non-repetition. (Article 24. 5)

The Convention will be governed by a [[Committee on Enforced Disappearances]] elected by its parties.  Parties are obliged to report to this committee on the steps they have taken to implement it within two years of becoming subject to it.

The Convention includes an optional complaints system whereby citizens of parties may appeal to the Committee for assistance in locating a disappeared person.&lt;ref&gt;International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearances, Arts. 30, 31&lt;/ref&gt; Parties may join this system at any time, but may only opt out of it upon signature.&lt;ref&gt;Where does it say that? Also do I believe that Art.30 is not optional. Only Art.31.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reservations==

===New Zealand===
While the [[New Zealand]] government supports the Convention and joined the consensus leading to its adoption, it retains significant concerns around inconsistencies between the convention and established international law. These include the definition of enforced disappearance as a crime against humanity in Article 5, and the Article 6 provisions relating to command responsibility.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mfat.govt.nz/Media-and-publications/Media/MFAT-speeches/2006/0-13-November-2006.php Statement by New Zealand Representative, 13 November 2006]&lt;/ref&gt; According to an MFAT spokesperson, New Zealand "has no immediate plans" to sign or ratify the Convention.&lt;ref&gt;[http://norightturn.blogspot.com/2007/02/no-plans-to-sign.html No Right Turn: No plans to sign]&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===
The United Kingdom stated its position during the discussion that followed the adoption of the General Assembly resolution on several technical points about the Convention.  For example, on Article 18, which sets out the minimum information that a lawyer or relative of a person deprived of liberty should have access to (such as when the arrest took place, who gave the order, and the health of the person), the ambassador explained that if the deprivation of liberty of a person was done legally according to the laws of the country, and was not an "enforced disappearance", then such information could be withheld from the relatives and legal counsel.&lt;ref&gt;{{ UN document |docid=A-61-PV.82 |body=General Assembly |type=Verbotim Report |session=61 |meeting=82 |page=2 |anchor=pg002-bk01-pa03 |date=20 December 2006 |speakername=Mr. Lee-Smith | speakernation=United Kingdom |accessdate=2008-02-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A question asked in Parliament about whether there was any intention to sign the Convention, resulted in the answer that the Government needed "to conduct a detailed analysis of the provisions of the treaty and their implications for implementation in order to determine the UK's position towards ratification".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theyworkforyou.com/wrans/?id=2007-06-26b.130.1|title=House of Lords - Enforced Disappearance|date=26 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;—The UK was active throughout the negotiations to draft the UN International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance and we supported its adoption last year at both the UN Human Rights Council and the UN General Assembly.

===United States===
A question during the daily State Department Press briefing that coincided with the date of the signing ceremony resulted in the following exchange:

:QUESTION: Did you notice that 57 countries signed a treaty today that would basically bar governments from holding secret detainees and the U.S. did not join?
:MR. MCCORMACK: Yeah. This is—I understand that there is a Convention for the Protection of All Persons and Enforced Disappearances. And I know—I have some information on it here, George. I confess I don't have all the details. I do know that we participated in all the meetings that produced the draft. Beyond that, I can't give you specific reasons here from the podium as to why we didn't sign on to it. We've put out a public document that I can give you the citation for afterwards and it explains our reasons for not participating in the draft. But I think just as a general comment, clearly the draft that was put up for a vote or put for signature was not one that met our needs and expectations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/news/2007/02/mil-070206-stateb01.htm|title=Daily Press Briefing - State Department|date=6 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Signatories and ratifications ==
The Convention attracted 57 signatures when opened for signature in Paris.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=21474&amp;Cr=treaty&amp;Cr1=]&lt;/ref&gt; Controversially, the United States did not sign, saying that it "did not meet our expectations".&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.aljazeera.net/NR/exeres/9ADB5E21-1E9C-4C58-B5CC-B84A5650B528.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; A number of European countries were not initial signatories to the convention; these included the United Kingdom, Spain, Italy, Germany, and the Netherlands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radionetherlands.nl/currentaffairs/dis070207mc |title=Finally tackling the threat of 'disappearance' |accessdate=3 September 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070828083337/http://www.radionetherlands.nl/currentaffairs/dis070207mc |archivedate=August 28, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Spain, Italy, Germany and the Netherlands have subsequently signed and ratified the convention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://treaties.un.org/pages/viewdetails.aspx?src=treaty&amp;mtdsg_no=iv-16&amp;chapter=4&amp;lang=en#1|title=Status of International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance |accessdate=3 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The initial signatories were Albania, Algeria, Argentina, Austria, Azerbaijan, Brazil, Burkina Faso, Burundi, Congo, Croatia, France, Ghana, Guatemala, Haiti, Japan, Lithuania, Maldives, Moldavia, Morocco, Uganda, Senegal, Serbia, Sierra Leone, Macedonia, Chad, Tunisia, Vanuatu, Belgium, Bolivia, Bosnia Herzegovina, Cameroon, Cape Verde, Chile, Comoros, Costa Rica, Cuba, Cyprus, Finland, Grenada, Honduras, India, Kenya, Lebanon, Luxembourg, Madagascar, Mali, Malta, Mexico, Monaco, Mongolia, Montenegro, Niger, Paraguay, Portugal, Samoa, Sweden, and Uruguay.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fidh.org/article.php3?id_article=4011]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{as of|2018|September}}, 59 states have ratified or acceded to the convention.

==International Campaign for the Convention==
The [[International Coalition against Enforced Disappearances]] (ICAED) is a global network of organisations of families of disappeared and NGO's campaigning in a nonviolent manner against the practice of enforced disappearances at the local, national and international level. The ICAED was founded in 2007 as a result from the 25-year-long struggle of families of disappeared and human rights defenders for an international legally binding instrument against enforced disappearances. The primary purpose of the ICAED is working together towards early ratification and effective implementation of the International Convention for the Protection of all Persons from Enforced Disappearances. [[Amnesty International]] is campaigning for [[Costa Rica]], [[Forced disappearance in Pakistan|Pakistan]], [[East Timor]], [[Burundi]], [[Portugal]], [[Morocco]], [[Lebanon]], [[Cape Verde]], [[Serbia]], and [[Paraguay]] to ratify the convention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/appeals-for-action/seven-more-ratifications-needed-enforced-disappearance-convention-enter-force |title=Seven more ratifications needed for Enforced Disappearance Convention to enter into force |publisher=Amnesty International |date=2009-08-28 |accessdate=2010-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6489">'''Japanese trademark law''' is mainly enacted by {{Nihongo|the Trademark Act|商標法|Shōhyō-hō}}. Under this Act, only registered trademarks establish a "[[trademark]]" right (Article 18), and examination procedure is necessary for trademarks to be registered (Article 14). Japan's first modern trade mark law was enacted in 1884. The current Trademark Act was enacted in 1958, and has been amended several times since then.
 
On the other hand, the protection for unregistered trademarks is provided by {{Nihongo|the Unfair Competition Prevention Act|不正競争防止法|Fusei kyōsō bōshi-hō}}.

==English translation==
The definitive version of [[Japanese law]] is the text in the [[Japanese language]].  An official English-language translation of the law does not exist, but the [[Ministry of Justice]] Japan has the website "Japanese Law Translation",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.japaneselawtranslation.go.jp/?re=02 Japanese Law Translation]&lt;/ref&gt; where you can search for Japanese laws and their unofficial English translation. IP laws such as [[Patent]] Act, [[Copyright law of Japan|Copyright]] Act, [[Trademark]] Act, [[Design]] Act and Unfair Competition Prevention Act are included there.

In addition, J-PlatPat offers the public access to [[Intellectual property|IP]] Gazettes of the [[Japan Patent Office]] (JPO) free of charge through internet.

Reliable information on Japanese IP law in English is also provided by the websites of [[Intellectual Property High Court]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ip.courts.go.jp/eng/index.html Intellectual Property High Court] in English&lt;/ref&gt; [[Japan Patent Office]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jpo.go.jp/index.htm Japan Patent Office] in English&lt;/ref&gt; "Transparency of Japanese Law Project",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tomeika.jur.kyushu-u.ac.jp/ip/index.html Japanese Copyright Law and Japanese Patent Law] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120816043120/http://www.tomeika.jur.kyushu-u.ac.jp/ip/index.html |date=2012-08-16 }} in English&lt;/ref&gt; European Patent Office,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epo.org/searching/asian/japan.html Patent information from Japan]&lt;/ref&gt; and Institute of Intellectual Property (IIP) of Japan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iip.or.jp/e/ Institute of Intellectual Property (IIP) of Japan] in English&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Jones v. City of Opelika''''', 316 U.S. 584 (1942),&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|name=Jones v. City of Opelika|volume=316|page=584|pin=|year=1942}}. {{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a case in which the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] held that a statute prohibiting the sale of books without a license was constitutional because it covered not a religious ritual but only individuals who engaged in a commercial activity.

== Background ==
The city of [[Opelika, Alabama]], charged Jones with violating a statute by selling books without a license. All licenses were subject to immediate revocation by the city without requiring advance notice. Jones, a [[Jehovah's Witness]], alleged that his rights to both [[freedom of the press]] and [[freedom of religion]] were violated.

==Decision==
===Majority opinion===
Writing for the majority, Justice [[Stanley Forman Reed|Reed]] wrote that individual rights must be balanced against competing rights of the state. He asserted that the fact that a person is engaged in disseminating religious materials does not place his action above regulation by the state. When people choose to use the vending of their religious books and tracts as a source of funds, the financial aspects of their transactions need not be wholly disregarded. To subject any religious or didactic group to a reasonable fee for their money-making activities does not require a finding that the licensed acts are purely commercial. It is enough that money is earned by the sale of articles.

When traditional means of distribution are used by religious groups, they can be held to the same standards as non-religious groups. The court held that Jones had no standing to challenge that part of the statute because he did not have a license that was revoked arbitrarily by the state.

===Dissenting opinions===
The two dissenting opinions, by Chief Justice [[Harlan Stone]] and Justice [[Frank Murphy]], examined both the unlimited discretion of the authorities in Opelika to withdraw a license as well as the amount of fees charged in order to get a license. The majority had considered that the amount of fees ($25.00 annually in some cases or $2.50 per day in others) was irrelevant because the issue had not been argued earlier, but the dissenters thought the amount to be relevant.

== Effects ==
{{Expand section|date=June 2008}}

The decision forced religious groups to meet the same requirements as nonreligious groups engaged in a similar activity. The fact that they were selling religious materials did not exempt them from statutes regulating commercial acts.

== Subsequent history ==

In the one paragraph ''per curiam'' decision ''Jones v. City of Opelika (II)'', 319 U.S. 103 (1943),&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|name=Jones v. City of Opelika|link=|volume=319|page=103|pin=|year=1943}}. {{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Court vacated ''Jones v. City of Opelika'' (1942) on the basis of the principles articulated in ''[[Murdock v. Commonwealth of Pennsylvania]]''; a state may not prohibit distribution of religious handbills where handbills seek to raise funds in a lawful fashion.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2625">'''Kai Puolamäki''' is a Finnish [[physicist]] and [[Internet activist]]. He has been a vocal spokesman of the Finnish [[anti-copyright]] movement.

== Academic career ==

Puolamäki graduated from the [[University of Helsinki]] in 1996. In 2001 he presented his [[doctoral thesis]] titled ''Breaking of [[R-parity]] and [[supersymmetry]] in supersymmetric models''. His earlier publications in [[physics]] have included articles on the [[Higgs boson]].

Since 2003 his publications have concentrated on [[information technology]] and [[pattern recognition]].  He now works as researcher (equivalent to a North American [[assistant professor]]) at the [[Helsinki University of Technology]] in the Laboratory of Computer and Information Science (the former laboratory of Professor emeritus [[Teuvo Kohonen]]).

== Internet activism ==
Puolamäki is a founder and board member of [[Electronic Frontier Finland]], the [[Finland|Finnish]] counterpart to the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]], and has written many of the groups position papers. 
He has been a regular [[expert witness]] on copyright issues at the [[Finnish Parliament]].

He has coined the term "[[copyright commandeering]]" to refer to instances of [[copyright misuse|misuse of claims of exclusive rights under copyright]].
In 2006 he started the ''Anti-Commandeering Investigation, Training and Resources'' centre modeled on [[Anti-Piracy Investigation, Training and Resources]] centre of the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry ([[IFPI]]) to register instances of copyright commandeering.

In addition to [[blogging]], he regularly contributes to the [[Finnish language]] &lt;code&gt;sfnet.*&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;finet.*&lt;/code&gt; [[Usenet]] hierarchies. He is the unofficial maintainer of the &lt;code&gt;finet.*&lt;/code&gt; hierarchy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cis.hut.fi/kaip/finet/ Finetin ryhmät] {{fi icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Politics of Switzerland}}
{{Use dmy dates|date=March 2015}}
{{Use British English|date=March 2015}}
The '''Landsgemeinde''' ({{IPA-de|ˈlantsɡəˌmaɪndə|lang}}) or "cantonal assembly" is a public, non-secret ballot voting system operating by [[majority rule]], which constitutes one of the oldest forms of [[direct democracy]]. Still at use – in a few places – at the [[Subdivisions of Switzerland|subnational]] political level in Switzerland, it was formerly practiced in eight [[cantons of Switzerland|cantons]]. For practical reasons, the ''Landsgemeinde'' has been abolished at the cantonal level in all but two cantons where it still holds the highest political authority: [[Canton of Appenzell Innerrhoden|Appenzell Innerrhoden]] and [[Canton of Glarus|Glarus]]. The ''Landsgemeinde'' is also convened in some [[Districts of Switzerland|districts]] of [[Canton of Appenzell Innerrhoden|Appenzell Innerrhoden]], [[Grisons]] and [[Canton of Schwyz|Schwyz]] to vote on local questions.

The German term ''Landsgemeinde'' itself is attested from at least the 16th century, in the 1561 dictionary of [[Josua Maaler|Pictorius]].
It is a compound from ''[[:wikt:Land|Land]]'' "land, canton; rural canton" and ''[[:wikt:Gemeinde|Gemeinde]]'' "community, commune".

Eligible citizens of the [[Cantons of Switzerland|canton]] or [[Districts of Switzerland|district]] meet on a certain day in the open air to decide on specific issues. Voting is accomplished by those in favor of a motion raising their hands. Historically, or in [[Appenzell]] until the admission of women, the only proof of citizenship necessary for men to enter the voting area was to show their ceremonial sword or Swiss military sidearm (bayonet); this gave proof that you were a freeman allowed to [[bear arms]] and to vote.

The ''Landsgemeinde'' has  been the sovereign institution of the Swiss rural cantons since the later Middle Ages, while in the city-cantons such as  [[Lucerne]], [[Schaffhausen]], or [[Bern]], a general assembly of all citizens was never established.

Similar assemblies in dependent territories were known under terms such as ''Talgemeinde'' (for ''[[Talschaft]]en'', used in [[Ursern]], [[Oberhasli|Hasli]], [[Obersimmental]]), ''[[Thing (assembly)|Teding]]'' ([[Engelberg]]), ''Parlamento'' ([[Leventina]]), ''Zendgemeinden'' (for the ''Zenden'' or districts of [[Valais]]), but also as ''Landsgemeinde'' in [[Toggenburg]] and in parts of [[Grisons]].&lt;ref&gt;Stadler, Hans. (2008) Historical Dictionary of Switzerland, ''Landsgemeinde'' [http://www.hls-dhs-dss.ch/textes/d/D10239.php]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==

===Structure===

At the ''Landsgemeinde'', citizens of a district or canton assemble annually in a public space under open sky to vote on a series of [[ballot question]]s. Depending on the canton, they raise their hand or voter identification card to either accept or reject the motion, which constitutes a ''non-secret ballot''. 
Decision is taken by [[majority rule]], and in case of incertitude, the [[Landammann]] estimates on which side the majority falls with the help of his colleagues from the communal council.

The duration of the ''Landsgemeinde'' varies significantly between the two cantons that still convene it. In [[Canton of Glarus|Glarus]], because of the high level of deliberation and possibility for citizens to propose an amendment of an existing law article or the introduction of a new one, the ''Landsgemeinde'' lasts between 2 and 4.5 hours on average. In [[Canton of Appenzell Innerrhoden|Appenzell Innerrhoden]] on the other hand, deliberation is limited, thus the ''Landsgemeinden'' usually end after 1 to 2.5 hours.&lt;ref name="tagblatt.ch"&gt;Ueber die Macht des kleinen Buergers.

The legislative power is concerned both in [[Canton of Appenzell Innerrhoden|Appenzell Innerrhoden]] and [[Canton of Glarus|Glarus]], where the ''Landsgemeinde'' can be used to implement laws or modify the cantonal constitution.

==History==

===Origin===

[[File:Welti Landsgemeinde3 1912.jpg|thumb|300px|''Die Landsgemeinde'', fresco in the [[Federal Palace of Switzerland]]  by  [[Albert Welti]] and Wilhelm Balmer]]
The ''Landsgemeinde'' assembly is a tradition with continuity back to the later Middle Ages, first recorded in the context of the [[formation of the Old Swiss Confederacy]]. The tradition  ultimately continues the [[Thing (assembly)|Germanic ''thing'']], although not uninterruptedly, as the [[Alamanni]] had lost their independence to the [[Frankish Empire]] in the 8th century, but re-emerging in territories with [[imperial immediacy]] since the 13th century.

The first ''Landsgemeinde'' proper is attested for [[Canton of Uri|Uri]] in 1231; however, these early assemblies grew as it were seamlessly out of the older institution of [[blood court]]s (assemblies with the purpose of dispensing judgement on criminal offenses, see [[high justice]]).
The [[Middle Latin]] texts when recording a ''Landsgemeinde'' usually express this by making ''universitas'' "the universality", or ''communitas hominum'' "the community of men" of a certain canton the subject of a sentence (see, for example, the [[Federal Charter of 1291]]), in order to emphasize that the decision was made by the community ([[direct democracy]]) rather than by a political elite.

In the [[Old Swiss Confederacy]], the existence of a ''Landsgemeinde'' was the defining feature of the rural cantons (''Länderorte'', as opposed to the city-cantons).
These Cantons were: [[Canton of Uri|Uri]], [[Schwyz]], [[Unterwalden]] (the [[forest-cantons]]), [[Canton of Glarus|Glarus]] and [[Appenzell]] and [[Zug]].
Zug took an intermediate position, as it was a city-canton which due to the existence of a ''Landsgemeinde'' was also counted under the rural cantons.

With the formation of [[Switzerland as a federal state]], the formerly sovereign cantonal assemblies became subject to federal law, and the ''Landsgemeinden'' came to be seen as anachronisms.

===Evolution and current situation===

[[File:Landsgemeinde auf dem Zaunplatz in Glarus, Kanton Glarus - 19308273920.jpg|thumb|right|300px|2013 Landsgemeinde in Glarus]]

The usage of the ''Landsgemeinde'' was progressively abandoned at the cantonal level through the 19th and 20th century. Indeed, [[Zug]] and [[Schwyz]] jettisoned it in 1848, followed by [[Canton of Uri|Uri]] in 1928.

[[Nidwalden]] in 1996, [[Appenzell Ausserrhoden]] in 1997 and [[Obwalden]] in 1998 abolished their cantonal ''Landsgemeinde'' by [[secret ballot]] votes.

Currently, [[Canton of Appenzell Innerrhoden|Appenzell Innerrhoden]], which rejected in 1991 by ''Landsgemeinde'' the abolition of this institution, and [[Canton of Glarus|Glarus]] are the only remaining cantons to use this form of direct democracy. Beside the 1991 vote of [[Canton of Appenzell Innerrhoden|Appenzell Innerrhoden]], the usage of the ''Landsgemeinde'' has since then never been questioned in these two cantons, which suggests that citizens are attached to their institution. Moreover, turnout rates remained constant in the last 50 years both in [[Canton of Appenzell Innerrhoden|Appenzell Innerrhoden]] and in [[Canton of Glarus|Glarus]]. In the latter canton a participation record of 50% was even recorded in 2001.&lt;ref name=Schaub309/&gt;

Glarus recently introduced measures to encourage participation at the ''Landsgemeinde''. In 2007, participation was extended to citizens aged 16 and older, which constitutes an exception in Switzerland.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.landsgemeinde.gl.ch/node/87&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, each year on the day of the ''Landsgemeinde'', participants can use all public transports of the canton for free.

In [[Canton of Appenzell Innerrhoden|Appenzell Innerrhoden]] and [[Canton of Glarus|Glarus]], the modernization of the institution, for example through the potential introduction of electronic vote-counting systems is debated, but no political party is opposed to the maintenance of the ''Landsgemeinden''.&lt;ref name="tagblatt.ch"/&gt;

Besides the cantonal assemblies, the Swiss Confederation is supporting various projects inspired by the ''Landsgemeinden'' and built on the same ideas. For instance, the 4th ''Cyber-Landsgemeinde'' was organised on April 6, 2016 in [[Bern]], with the aim to use [[deliberative democracy|democratic deliberation]] to foster reflections and find solutions related to the topic of cyber-security.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vtg.admin.ch/internet/vtg/de/home/dokumentation/news/newsdetail.61251.nsb.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-04-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160420132415/http://www.vtg.admin.ch/internet/vtg/de/home/dokumentation/news/newsdetail.61251.nsb.html |archivedate=20 April 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, the urban municipality of [[Kloten]] implemented in 2012 a version of the ''Landsgemeinde'' to deliberate on the allocation of funds to local projects, which enabled for example the construction of a new Kindergarten.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.landsgemeinde-kloten.ch/archiv/landsgemeinde-2012&lt;/ref&gt;

==Related political paradigms and criticisms==

===Direct democracy===

The ''Landsgemeinde'' forms one of the pillars of the direct democratic core of the Swiss political structure. Even if its use has sharply decreased in the past century, it is still considered as a characteristic institution of the Swiss democracy and is generally considered as a [[Participatory Democracy|participative]] and [[Inclusive Democracy|inclusive]] democratic practice. However, while participation is according to the ''cantonal constitutions'' not only encouraged but also required as part of the [[Citizenship|civic duty]] of the concerned individuals, it is unclear if the ''Landsgemeinde'' offers better inclusivity and fosters a higher level of participation than the more traditional secret-ballot voting methods.&lt;ref&gt;Schaub (2012), 322-323.&lt;/ref&gt; Paul Lucardie (2014) notes for example that:

"Evidence suggests that attendance at assemblies in Appenzell and Glarus, as well as most town meetings in Vermont and possibly also in ancient Athens, has always been limited to roughly twenty per cent of the citizenry."&lt;ref&gt;Lucardie, Paul.(2014) ''Democratic Extremism in Theory and Practice: All Power to the People.'' 56&lt;/ref&gt;

Moreover, the [[Women's suffrage|inclusion of women]] was until recently one of the main concerns for the inclusivity of the ''Landsgemeinde''. Up to 1991, women were not allowed in the ''Landsgemeinde'' in the canton of [[Canton of Appenzell Innerrhoden|Appenzell Innerrhoden]], which was the last canton of Switzerland to grant women the right to vote, making it an exceptionally late introduction of women's suffrage for a European country.&lt;ref&gt;Geschichte-schweiz.ch (2004) ''Switzerland's Long Way to Women's Right to Vote'' http://history-switzerland.geschichte-schweiz.ch/chronology-womens-right-vote-switzerland.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ochlocracy===
There have been suggestions placing the ''Landsgemeinde'' system in the vicinity of "[[ochlocracy]]" or "[[tyranny of the majority]]".{{clarify|date=June 2017}}{{who|date=June 2017}}
Blum and Köhler (2006) suggested there might only be a "limited level of preliminary debate" possible leading to a failure to consider minority opinions.&lt;ref&gt;Blum, R., Köhler, B. (2006). ''Partizipation und Deliberation in der Versammlungsdemokratie. Schweizer Landsgemeinden mit Kommunikationsdefiziten?'' In K. Imhof, R. Blum, H.Bonfadelli, &amp; O. Jarren (ed.), Demokratie in der Mediengesellschaft (285–303).&lt;/ref&gt;

The open ballot system ostensibly fails to assure [[secret ballot|the secrecy of the vote]]
Switzerland has explicitly introduced an  exception to article 25 of its International Pact on Civil and Political Rights in order to protect the  ''Landsgemeinde'', avoiding to comply with the letter of  article 21.3 of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] protecting the secrecy of the vote.
&lt;ref&gt;https://www.admin.ch/opc/de/classified-compilation/19660262/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;
Switzerland has never ratified the first convention protocol of the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] for a similar reason.&lt;ref&gt;Hangartner, Yvo, Kley, Andreas. (2000) ''Die demokratischen Rechte in Bund und Kantonen der Schweizerischen Eidgenossenschaft''. Schulthess Verlag.&lt;/ref&gt;

Under such conditions, [[social control]] and other [[crowd manipulation]] processes might then prevent citizens from voting according to their own preferences and mislead rational decisions. On the other hand, according to the Greek antic tradition of [[parrhesia]] -literally "saying everything"- a public assembly could teach individuals to express their opinions with frankness and collective responsibility.&lt;ref&gt;Saxonhouse, Arlene W. (2000) ''The Practice of Parrhêsia.'' Free Speech and Democracy in Ancient Athens. 85-90.&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies of outcomes of the ''Landsgemeinde'' in various administrative divisions (Schaub 2012, Gerber &amp; Mueller 2014{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}) seem to suggest that proper preliminary deliberation can help reach better decisions defined by the "unforced force of the better argument" (Habermas, 1992) &lt;ref&gt;Habermas, Jürgen. (1992) ''Deliberative Politics: A Procedural Concept of Democracy''. 306&lt;/ref&gt;{{clarify|date=June 2017}}&lt;!--explain who is citing Habermas? One of the studies mentioned? --&gt;

The [[law]] of [[South America]] is one of the most unified in the world. All countries can be said to follow civil law systems, although recent developments in the [[law of Brazil]] suggest a move towards the ''[[stare decisis]]'' doctrine. Moreover, all countries have recently signed up to the [[Union of South American Nations]] agreement, which aims to establish a system of supra-national law along the lines of the [[European Union]].

'''New Democracy''' or the '''New Democratic Revolution''' is a concept based on [[Mao Zedong]]'s "Bloc of Four Social Classes" theory in [[Chinese Communist Revolution|post-revolutionary China]] which argued originally that [[democracy in China]] would take a decisively distinct path, much different from that of the [[Liberalism|liberal]] [[capitalist]] and [[Parliamentary democracy|parliamentary democratic]] systems in the [[Western world]] as well as [[Ideology of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Soviet-style socialism]] in [[Eastern Europe]]. As time passed, the New Democracy concept was adapted to other countries and regions with similar justifications.

== Concept ==
The concept of New Democracy aims to overthrow [[feudalism]] and achieve independence from [[colonialism]]. However, it dispenses with the rule predicted by [[Karl Marx]] that a capitalist class would usually follow such a struggle, claiming instead to seek to enter directly into [[socialism]] through a [[coalition]] of classes fighting the old ruling order. The coalition is subsumed under the leadership and guidance of the working class and its [[communist party]], working with the communists irrespective of their competing ideologies in order to achieve the more immediate goal of a "new democratic order." This was a view actually shared by [[Vladimir Lenin]] who had broken with the [[Mensheviks]] over the idea that the working class could organize and lead the "Democratic Revolution" in an underdeveloped country like Russia where the objective conditions for socialism did not yet exist.&lt;ref&gt;
Lenin: The Revolutionary-democratic Dictatorship Of the Proletariat and the Peasantry V.I. Lenin - https://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1905/apr/12b.htm &lt;/ref&gt; The Chinese communists hoped that the working class in a similar fashion could then build full-blown [[Socialist mode of production|socialism]] and [[Communism#Marxist communism|communism]] in spite of the competing [[class interest]]s of the social classes of the "bloc".

The block of classes reflecting the principles of New Democracy is symbolized most readily by the stars on the [[flag of China]]. The largest star symbolizes the [[Communist Party of China]]'s leadership and the surrounding four smaller stars symbolizing the Bloc of Four Classes: [[proletarian]] workers, [[peasants]], the [[petty bourgeoisie]] ([[small business]] owners) and the nationally-based [[Capitalist mode of production (Marxist theory)|capitalists]]. This is the coalition of classes for Mao's New Democratic Revolution as he described it in his works. Mao's New Democracy explains the Bloc of Four Classes as an unfortunate but necessary consequence of [[imperialism]] as described by Lenin.

== Comparisons with core Marxism ==
The classical [[Marxist]] understanding of the stages of economic and historical development of the [[Mode of production|modes of production]] under which a [[socialist revolution]] can take place is that the socialist revolution occurs only after the capitalist [[Bourgeois democracy|bourgeois-democratic]] revolution happens first. According to this, the bourgeois-democratic revolution paves the way for the industrial proletarian class to emerge as the majority class in society, after which it then overthrows capitalism and begins constructing socialism. Mao disagreed and said that the bourgeois-democratic revolution and the socialist revolution could be combined into a single stage, rather than two separate back-to-back stages. He called this stage New Democracy.

Marx himself is often misunderstood on this topic as he did not postulate that strictly only after a bourgeois society has formed, a socialist revolution would become possible. Instead, most notably in a letter to [[Vera Zasulich]], Marx suggested a form of revolutionary change in Russia at the time that is very much akin to Mao's thesis of New Democracy: {{quote|text=In dealing with the genesis of capitalist production I stated that it is founded on "the complete separation of the producer from the means of production" (p. 315, column 1, French edition of Capital) and that "the basis of this whole development is the expropriation of the agricultural producer. To date this has not been accomplished in a radical fashion anywhere except in England... But all the other countries of Western Europe are undergoing the same process" (1.c., column II).

I thus expressly limited the "historical inevitability" of this process to the countries of Western Europe. And why? Be so kind as to compare Chapter XXXII, where it says:

The "process of elimination transforming individualised and scattered means of production into socially concentrated means of production, of the pigmy property of the many into the huge property of the few, this painful and fearful expropriation of the working people, forms the origin, the genesis of capital... Private property, based on personal labour [...] will be supplanted by capitalist private property, based on the exploitation of the labour of others, on wage labour" (p. 341, column II).

Thus, in the final analysis, it is a question of the transformation of ''one form of private property into another form of private property''. Since the land in the hands of the Russian peasants has never been their private property, how could this development be applicable?|sign=[[Karl Marx]], ''First Draft of Letter To Vera Zasulich'', 1881&lt;ref&gt;MECW, Volume 24, p. 346.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== Effects of establishment ==
Once New Democracy has been established in the way Mao's theory outlines, the country is subsequently claimed to be ideologically socialist and working towards communism under the leadership of its leading [[communist party]] and its people are actively involved in the construction of socialism. Examples are the [[Great Leap Forward]] and the [[Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution]] for what Mao viewed as the [[participatory democracy]] inherent in the New Democracy concept.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Zedong|first=Mao|title=On New Democracy|year=1940|publisher=Foreign Language Press|location=Peking|url=http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/mao/selected-works/volume-2/mswv2_26.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of New Democracy's nature as an "intermediate stage", it is considered a stepping-stone to socialism—an essentially two-stage theory of first New Democracy, then socialism. Given that the self-proclaimed ultimate goal of socialist construction is the creation of a stateless, classless and moneyless communist society, adding the New Democratic Revolution as a prerequisite stage arguably makes the whole process of the revolution a three-stage theory: first New Democracy, then socialism and finally communism.

== Examples ==
Currently, the [[Shining Path]], the [[New People's Army]] of the Philippines, and the [[Communist Party of India (Maoist)]] pursue similar actions pursuant to similar ideas, conducting active [[guerrilla warfare]] ("[[people's war]]") with the intent of establishing New Democracy. In 2006, the [[Unified Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist)]] entered the [[government of Nepal]] using similar New Democratic reasoning and methods. However, it was expelled from the coalition in 2009 and its leader (who had been elected [[Prime Minister]]) was deposed, so since then the CPN(M) has oscillated between threatening to return to [[armed struggle]] and leading [[general strike]]s in Nepal using its still-considerable influence in the Nepalese [[labour movement]].

Some have argued that the "Fast Track Land Reform Program" in [[Zimbabwe]] represents the culmination of New Democracy there and these same people usually also say that [[ZANU-PF]] remains a genuinely socialist party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sherman|first=Vincent|title=New Democracy &amp; ZANU-PF: Zimbabwe's Revolutionary Path|url=http://return2source.wordpress.com/2011/04/22/new-democracy-zanu-pf-zimbabwes-revolutionary-path/|work=Return to the Source|publisher=Return to the Source|accessdate=10 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==
Some criticise New Democracy as class collaborationism or as a stage to replace the dictatorship of the proletariat, but Mao completely rejected this by saying: {{quote|text="Firmly establish the new-democratic social order." That's a harmful formulation. In the transition period changes are taking place all the time and socialist factors are emerging every day. How can this "new-democratic order" be "firmly established"? [...] The period of transition is full of contradictions and struggles. Our present revolutionary struggle is even more profound than the revolutionary armed struggle of the past. It is a revolution that will bury the capitalist system and all other systems of exploitation once and for all. The idea, "Firmly establish the new-democratic social order", goes against the realities of our struggle and hinders the progress of the socialist cause.|sign=[[Mao Zedong]]|source="Refute Right Deviationist Views That Depart From the General Line", p. 93–94}}

City of Lago Vista|Atwater v.

I, ch. 4, §§5–6{{full|date=November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Such power was interpreted to extend not only to the watchmen themselves, but also to assistants, and allowed the arrest and detention of all persons.&lt;ref&gt;4 Blackstone 289{{full|date=November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1645">'''Non-qualified stock options''' (typically abbreviated '''NSO''' or '''NQSO''') are [[stock option]]s which do not qualify for the special treatment accorded to [[incentive stock option]]s.

Incentive stock options are only available for employees and other restrictions apply for them. For regular [[tax]] purposes, incentive stock options have the advantage that no income is reported when the option is exercised and, if certain requirements are met, the entire gain when the stock is sold is taxed as long-term [[capital gains]].

In contrast, non-qualified stock options result in additional taxable income to the recipient at the time that they are exercised, the amount being the difference between the exercise price and the market value on that date.

Non-qualified stock options are frequently preferred by employers because the issuer is allowed to take a tax deduction equal to the amount the recipient is required to include in his or her income.

If they have deferred vesting, then taxpayers must comply with special rules for all types of [[deferred compensation]] Congress enacted in 2004 in the wake of the [[Enron scandal]] known as [[Internal Revenue Code section 409A|Section 409A]] of the [[Internal Revenue Code]].

The '''open-core model''' is a [[business model]] for the [[monetization]] of commercially-produced [[open-source software]]. Coined by Andrew Lampitt in 2008,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Phipps|first1=Simon|title=Open Source Strategies for the Enterprise|date=July 2012|publisher=O'Reilly Media|isbn=978-1-4493-4117-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; the open-core model primarily involves offering a "core" or [[crippleware|feature-limited]] version of a software product as [[free and open-source software]], while offering "commercial" versions or add-ons as [[proprietary software]].&lt;ref name="Riehle"&gt;{{cite conference

==Controversy==
The concept of open-core software has proven to be controversial, as many developers do not consider the business model to be true open-source software. Despite this, open-core models are used by a large number of open-source software companies.&lt;ref name=li-opencore&gt;{{cite web|title=Open Core Debate: The Battle for a Business Model|url=http://www.linuxinsider.com/story/66807.html|publisher=Linux Insider|accessdate=28 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use of contributor license agreements==
Some open-core products require their contributors to sign a [[contributor license agreement]], which either dictates that the copyright of all contributions to the product [[Work for hire|become the property of its owner]], or that the product's owner is given an unlimited, non-exclusive license to use the contributions, but the authors retain copyright ownership. In an open-core scenario, these agreements are typically meant to allow the commercial owner of the product (which in some cases, is ultimately the copyright holder to all of its code, regardless of its original author) to simultaneously market versions of the product under open-source and non-free licenses. This is in contrast with more traditional uses of CLAs, which are meant solely to allow the steward of an open-source project to defend its copyright, or guarantee that the code will only ever be made available under open-source terms, thus protecting it from becoming open core.&lt;ref name=infoworld-mysqlmistake&gt;{{cite web|title=MySQL mistake is a wake-up call on open source ownership|url=http://www.javaworld.com/article/2078812/open-source-tools/mysql-mistake-is-a-wake-up-call-on-open-source-ownership.html|website=InfoWorld|accessdate=11 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://ev.kde.org/announcements/2008-08-22-fsfe-welcomes-fla.php | date = 2008-08-22 | title = FSFE welcomes KDE's adoption of the Fiduciary Licence Agreement (FLA)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.gnu.org/prep/maintain/html_node/Copyright-Papers.html | title = 6.1 Copyright Papers | accessdate = 2011-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ponosov's case''' is an action against Aleksandr Ponosov, a teacher and principal of a high school in [[Sepych]] village of [[Perm Krai]] of [[Russia]]. Aleksandr Ponosov was charged with illegal use of [[copyright infringement|unlicensed]] copies of [[Microsoft Windows]] and [[Microsoft Office]] on 12 computers being used in the school (article [[:s:ru:Уголовный кодекс Российской Федерации#Статья_146._Нарушение_авторских_и_смежных_прав|146.3]] of the [[Russian Criminal Code]]) and of damnification of 266,593.63 [[ruble]]s (about 10,000 [[USD]]) to [[Microsoft Corporation]]. The charges could result in 5 years of imprisonment. The unlicensed copies were pre-installed on the computers by the [[original equipment manufacturer]] prior to the school's purchase. Ultimately, Ponosov was found [[Acquittal|not guilty]]. This case caused significant controversy in Russian [[mass media]] and [[blog]]s as well as among Russian [[politician]]s and [[lawyer]]s (especially copyright law experts).

==Case details==
In early 2005, Ponosov's school bought 20 new PCs with preinstalled Microsoft software. In late May 2006, a procursive inspection revealed unlicensed copies of Microsoft software on 12 of the 20 computers. When the academic year began in September 2006, students were taught information science in front of inoperative computers.

==Court history==
Ponosov pleaded not guilty in his first hearing.

On 9 January 2007, a second hearing was conducted in the town of [[Vereshchagino, Perm Krai|Vereshchagino]], [[Perm Krai]] before Judge Vera Barakina. The prosecution presented a bill of particulars as well as witnesses. Official representatives of the injured party, Microsoft Corporation, did not appear.

A third hearing was held on 29 January 2007. Representatives of Microsoft's regional dealer stated that the employee who had sold the computers with unlicenesd copies of Windows was imposed a fine of 10,000 rubles (about 380 US [[dollar]]s).

During the fourth hearing on 12 February 2007 Ponosov refused to apologize to Microsoft in order to settle the case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://eng.cnews.ru/news/top/indexEn.shtml?2007/02/12/235414 |title=Ponosov refused to make peace with Microsoft |author=cnews.ru |accessdate=2007-03-04 |date=2007-02-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071230182542/http://eng.cnews.ru/news/top/indexEn.shtml?2007%2F02%2F12%2F235414 |archivedate=2007-12-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The prosecution demanded that Ponosov be fined 3,000 rubles (about $115).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://lenta.ru/news/2007/02/14/ponossoff/ |title=Ponosov's evil deeds valued at 3 thousand rubles |author=[[Lenta.ru]] |date=2007-02-14 |accessdate=2007-03-04|language=ru}}&lt;/ref&gt; Surprisingly, Judge Barakina closed the case on February 15 "for insignificance"; this left both parties unsatisfied with prosecutors deciding to [[appeal]], on the basis that the decision was "unlawful",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://lenta.ru/news/2007/02/26/ponosov/ |title=Prosecutors appeal on closure of Ponosov case |author=[[Lenta.ru]] |date=2007-02-26 |accessdate=2007-03-04 |language=ru}}&lt;/ref&gt; while Ponosov filed an appeal, demanding a not guilty verdict.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://lenta.ru/news/2007/02/26/ponosov1/ |title=Ponosov demanded not guilty verdict |author=[[Lenta.ru]] |date=2007-02-26 |accessdate=2007-03-04|language=ru}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 27 March 2007 Perm Krai court set aside the decision of the court of first instance and remitted the case for reconsideration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|accessdate=2007-03-27|language=ru}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 7 May 2007 the trial court found that Ponosov had caused Microsoft damages of 266,000 roubles and ruled that Ponosov was guilty while fining him 5,000 roubles ($194.4).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Teacher Fined for Microsoft Piracy |work=Reuters News Service |pages= |date=2007-05-07 |url=http://www.cnn.com/2007/TECH/05/07/russia.microsoft.reut/index.html |accessdate=2007-05-08 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070509203235/http://www.cnn.com/2007/TECH/05/07/russia.microsoft.reut/index.html |archivedate=2007-05-09 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 19 December 2008 Perm Krai court repealed the sentence of Vereshchagino's court and found Ponosov not guilty.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kommersant.ru/region/perm/page.htm?year=2008&amp;issue=233&amp;id=288786&amp;section=7272 M.Лобанов Учитель Александр Поносов выиграл процесс у Microsoft] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303191450/http://www.kommersant.ru/region/perm/page.htm?year=2008&amp;issue=233&amp;id=288786&amp;section=7272 |date=2016-03-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Opinions==
===Vladimir Putin===
During a [[press conference]] in the Kremlin on 1 February 2007, Russian president [[Vladimir Putin]] said: “If the legislation which, as I see, is not very adequate, needs to be amended, then we will reflect on this. But to grab someone for buying a computer somewhere and start threatening him with prison, is complete nonsense, simply ridiculous.”&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kremlin.ru/eng/speeches/2007/02/01/1309_type82915type82917_117609.shtml Transcript of Press Conference with the Russian and Foreign Media] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070210073057/http://www.kremlin.ru/eng/speeches/2007/02/01/1309_type82915type82917_117609.shtml |date=2007-02-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mikhail Gorbachev and Alexander Lebedev===
On 5 February 2007 [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] (ex-president of the [[USSR]]) and [[Alexander Lebedev]] (deputy of Russian [[State Duma]]) published in [[Novaya Gazeta]] an open letter to [[Bill Gates]] (chairman of [[Microsoft]]) requesting withdrawal of the action against Alexander Ponosov.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.novayagazeta.ru/data/2007/08/26.html Open Letter to Mr. Bill Gates, Chairman of Microsoft Corporation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070208171219/http://www.novayagazeta.ru/data/2007/08/26.html |date=2007-02-08 }} {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Microsoft responded with statement from Microsoft Russia chairman Olga Dergunova that "Microsoft did not instigate the prosecution against Mr. Ponosov.

On 3 February 2007, Microsoft Corporation's Russian office published a statement saying that Microsoft does not consider this case a malignant copyright violation, and Microsoft did not claim and would not claim in the future any civil suit against Ponosov.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.microsoft.com/rus/news/issues/2007/02/ponosov.mspx Statement of Russian office of Microsoft] {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Follow-ups==
In fall 2007 Russian authorities sponsored pilot usage of Linux-based software in the schools of [[Perm Krai]], [[Tatarstan]] and [[Tomsk Oblast]] to see if it's possible to implement school computer studies relying on Open Source products.

In February 2008, Ponosov resigned as school headmaster and began researching the use of [[Open Source]] software in the [[Ministry of Education (Russia)|Russian education system]]. He joined efforts with former parliamentarian [[Viktor Alksnis]] to start the Center of Free Technology, a non-profit initiative to work on such tasks.

As a result of the pilot programs, in October 2008, Russian officials mandated that all schools use open source software.

'''''Reckitt &amp; Colman Ltd v Borden Inc''''' [1990] 1 All E.R. 873, &amp;ndash; also known as the '''Jif Lemon case''' &amp;ndash; is a leading decision of the [[House of Lords]] on the [[tort]] of [[passing off]]. The Court reaffirmed the three part test (reputation and goodwill, misrepresentation, and damage) in order to establish a [[Claim (legal)|claim]] of passing off.

==Background==
per [[Christopher Slade|Slade LJ]]: [[Reckitt Benckiser|Reckitt]], sold [[lemon juice]] under the name "[[Jif (lemon juice)|Jif Lemon]]" which came in plastic yellow container that was shaped like a [[lemon]]. Borden, a competitor, started to produce lemon juice in a similar lemon-shaped plastic container that was only slightly larger with a flattened side. Reckitt sued Borden for passing off their product as Jif Lemon juice.

At trial the Court found in favour of Reckitt, which was subsequently upheld at the [[Court of Appeal of England and Wales|Court of Appeal]].

==Opinion of the Court==
At the House of Lords, the Court upheld the previous judgments.

[[Lord Oliver]], at page 880, reaffirmed the classic test for passing off:
:''First, he must establish a goodwill or reputation attached to the goods or services which he supplies in the mind of the purchasing public by association with the identifying "get-up" (whether it consists simply of a brand name or a trade description, or the individual features of labelling or packaging) under which his particular goods or services are offered to the public, such that the get-up is recognised by the public as distinctive specifically of the plaintiff's goods or services. Second, he must demonstrate a misrepresentation by the defendant to the public (whether or not intentional) leading or likely to lead the public to believe that goods or services offered by him are the goods or services of the plaintiff. ... Third, he must demonstrate that he suffers or ... that he is likely to suffer damage by reason of the erroneous belief engendered by the defendant's misrepresentation that the source of the defendant's goods or services is the same as the source of those offered by the plaintiff.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2478">'''Renato Treves''' (1907–1992) was born in [[Turin]], [[Italy]] of a Jewish family. According to [[Vincenzo Ferrari]], Treves "devoted his first academic study to the diffusion of Claude Henri de Saint-Simon's (1760-1825) doctrines in Italy" before turning his attention to the [[neo-Kantian]] movement and [[Hans Kelsen]]'s [[Pure Theory of Law]].&lt;ref&gt;Ferrari 2007: 1520.&lt;/ref&gt;

Treves also exerted considerable influence on the development of the [[sociology of law]] in Italy and is one of the founders of the [[Research Committee on Sociology of Law]].

Renato Treves kept faith with a Weberian and Kelsenian vision of sociology of law, as distinct from legal science. He advocated empirical research as a means of testing theories critically and favoured open as opposed to closed social portraits of law. Primarily, he argued in favour of a perspectivist and relativistic vision of law and society, combating all kinds of absolutism in both science and politics, from a liberal socialist stance that he upheld in many of his writings.&lt;ref&gt;Ferrari 2007: 1521.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Russian Constitution of 1906''' refers to a major revision of the 1832 Fundamental Laws of the [[Russian Empire]], which transformed the formerly [[absolute monarchy|absolutist]] state into one in which the [[Emperor of All Russia|emperor]] agreed for the first time to share his [[Tsarist autocracy|autocratic power]] with a [[parliament]].  It was enacted on {{OldStyleDateNY|6 May|23 April}} 1906, on the eve of the opening of the first [[State Duma]]. This first-ever Russian [[Constitution]] was a revision of the earlier Fundamental Laws, which had been published as the [[Code of Laws of the Russian Empire]] (Russian: ''Свод законов Российской империи'', [[Reforms of Russian orthography|pre-1917 Russian orthography]]: ''Сводъ законовъ Россійской имперіи'') in 1832.  It was granted during the [[Russian Revolution of 1905]], in a last-ditch effort by the imperial government to preserve its own existence and keep the nation from sliding into all-out anarchy.

The new constitution provided for a bicameral [[Russian parliament]], without whose approval no laws were to be enacted in Russia.  This legislature was composed of an upper house, known as the [[State Council of the Russian Empire|State Council]], and a lower house, known as the [[Imperial Duma|State Duma]]. Half of the members of the upper house were appointed by the Tsar, while the other half were elected by various governmental, clerical and commercial interests. Members of the lower house were to be chosen by different classes of the Russian people, through a complex scheme of indirect elections&amp;mdash;with the system being weighted to ensure the ultimate preponderance of the propertied classes. While the Duma held the power of legislation and the right to question the Tsar's [[Minister (government)|ministers]], it did not have control over their appointment or dismissal, which was reserved to the monarch alone. Nor could it alter the constitution, save upon the emperor's initiative. The Tsar retained an absolute [[veto]] over legislation, as well as the right to dismiss the Duma at any time, for any reason he found suitable.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ru.wikisource.org/wiki/%D0%9E%D1%81%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%BD%D1%8B%D0%B5_%D0%97%D0%B0%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%BD%D1%8B_%D0%A0%D0%BE%D1%81%D1%81%D0%B8%D0%B9%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%B9_%D0%98%D0%BC%D0%BF%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%B8%D0%B8|title=Основные Законы Российской Империи — Викитека|website=ru.wikisource.org|language=ru|access-date=2017-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The emperor also had the right to issue decrees during the Duma's absence&amp;mdash;though these lost their validity if not approved by the new parliament within two months.

This charter had been granted under duress, and Nicholas abhorred its restrictions upon his power, which he had sworn at his [[Coronation of the Russian monarch|coronation]] to pass on to his son. He dismissed the First and Second Dumas when they proved "unsatisfactory" to him,&lt;ref&gt;Ukase of 3 June 1907.&lt;/ref&gt; and unilaterally altered the election statutes (in violation of the constitution) to ensure that more [[Landed property|landed]] persons would be elected to future Dumas. Although the resulting Third and Fourth Dumas proved more lasting, they still quarreled with the Tsar and his government over the general direction of state policy, and over the fundamental nature of the Russian state. Ultimately, with the outbreak of the [[Russian Revolution of 1917]], the Duma took a leading role in bringing about the Tsar's abdication, which led in turn to the abolition of the [[monarchy]] and the ascent to power of the [[Russian Provisional Government]] under [[Alexander Kerensky|Kerensky]].

==Russian government prior to 1906==
{{unref|section|date=May 2018}}
Prior to the enactment of the 1906 Russian constitution, the Russian Empire had been an absolute monarchy, ruled by an autocratic emperor, who was commonly referred to by his pre-imperial title of "Tsar". The precise regulations by which the Tsar exercised his imperial prerogatives were first codified in 1832, with the issuance of the ''Set of Laws of the Russian Empire'' (''Свод законов Российскои империи''), penned by [[Mikhail Speransky]]. These laws could be altered or repealed by the emperor.  However, the autocratic Tsars were generally limited by two constraints: they and their spouses must profess the [[Russian Orthodox]] faith, and they must obey the [[Pauline Laws|laws of succession]] laid down by Emperor [[Paul I of Russia|Paul I]]. Beyond that, the power of the Russian emperor was virtually limitless.

Although a [[Boyar Duma]] had existed in Russia from Muscovite times until the rule of [[Peter I of Russia|Peter I]], it was an advisory institution, without legislative prerogatives. Peter abolished this organ in 1721, replacing it with the [[Governing Senate]]. This body consisted of nine (later ten) members, and was intended to oversee administration of the empire, under the direction of an [[Procurator (Russia)|Ober-Procurator]], appointed (as were all members of this body) by the sovereign. The emperor might submit draft decree proposals to this committee for their deliberation and recommendations, but he was not bound to do so, nor was he required to accept their advice, once tendered. In later years, the Governing Senate took on an important role in administration and law, and by the late nineteenth century it had evolved into the highest judicial organ in Russia, with all officials and legal institutions under its control. Its decisions as to interpretation of the legal code, unless countermanded by the Tsar, were seen as absolutely authoritative. However, the Senate still remained at all times under the monarch's direct control: he named and dismissed its members, could alter its prerogatives, and was free to overrule its actions. As such, the Ruling Senate was never considered to be a "parliament" in the modern sense.

Various proposals for reform emerged during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries: [[Alexander I of Russia|Alexander I]] formed a [[Privy Committee]] to investigate introducing a parliament and ministerial system; the latter was eventually introduced, but the former foundered due to the [[Napoleonic Wars]] and opposition from conservative members of the [[nobility]].  Alexander did establish a [[State Council of Imperial Russia|State Council]], with 35&amp;mdash;later 60&amp;mdash;members, whose major duty was the investigation, promulgation and abrogation of laws.  Its four departments were:

*Legislative;
*Civil and Ecclesiastical Administration;
*State Economy; and
*Industry, Science and Commerce.

Each department had its own presiding officer (called a State Secretary) and met separately to discuss matters assigned to it. There were also plenary sessions of the whole Council, called to peruse laws proposed by the Tsar's ministers, who were ex-officio members. While most sessions concerned the budget and state expenditures, the Council would examine anything submitted to it. It had no authority to propose changes to existing laws, nor to investigate anything not initiated by the Tsar. Decision-making authority rested with the emperor, who appointed and dismissed members of the Council.

Alexander's nephew [[Alexander II of Russia|Alexander II]] entertained reformist ideas, culminating in a project initiated by Count [[Mikhail Loris-Melikov]], who had been appointed his Minister of Interior in August 1880.  One of these proposals would have established two Imperial commissions, to be populated by indirectly elected members, who would advise the Emperor on further reforms. Alexander's [[Assassination of Alexander II of Russia|assassination]], on the very day he intended to sign this proposal into law, effectively killed all mention of legislative reform in Russia&amp;mdash;as the murdered Tsar's son, [[Alexander III of Russia|Alexander III]], insisted upon preserving the autocracy intact. Nicholas II, who succeeded his father in 1894, was also committed to maintain absolute monarchy, even in the face of ever-increasing calls for reform, peasant unrest, and the rise of revolutionary organizations within his empire. When reforms became inevitable, Nicholas would insist upon retaining as much of his previous authority as possible. For instance, faced with demands from municipal and provincial dumas for the establishment of a national legislative assembly, Nicholas offered only a broadening of the local councils' authority, insurance for factory workers, and the abolition of censorship. This was not considered nearly enough for the liberals, who agitated even more for a constitution and far-reaching political reforms.

==Adoption of the constitution==
{{Main|Russian Revolution of 1905|October Manifesto}}

Russian defeat in the [[Russo-Japanese War]] of 1905 combined with a rising tide of revolutionary feeling in Russia to produce the Russian Revolution of 1905. This upheaval was initially provoked by [[Bloody Sunday (1905)|Bloody Sunday]], in which thousands of unarmed protesters (largely urban workers and intellectuals) seeking to present a [[petition]] to the Tsar were met by imperial troops, who opened fire on them and killed several.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thenagain.info/webchron/easteurope/1905Rev.html The 1905 Revolution] and [http://depts.washington.edu/baltic/papers/russianrevolution.htm The Russian Revolution], by Peter Litwin.&lt;/ref&gt; As word of this tragedy spread across the empire, it combined with the catastrophic Russian defeat in the Far East to incite a major uprising against the emperor's authority. Although the [[Imperial Russian Army|Tsarist army]] largely remained loyal to the emperor, close advisors to the Tsar became convinced that some kind of fundamental change in State administration was inevitable, if the monarchy was to survive.

Count [[Sergei Witte]], the Tsar's Minister of Finance and recent Russian plenipotentiary at the [[Treaty of Portsmouth]] negotiations (ending the war with Japan), was named chairman of the Tsar's [[Russian Council of Ministers|Council of Ministers]] after returning home from [[New Hampshire]]. He proposed introduction of an elected legislature, the granting of basic civil rights, and the formation of a [[constitutional monarchy]]. Nicholas strenuously resisted these ideas, but gave in after his first choice to head a military dictatorship,&lt;ref name="wortman398"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=wGp4M2DzfMQC&amp;pg=PA398&amp;lpg=PA398&amp;dq=Grand+Duke+nicholas+1905+dictatorship&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=gAm0vKgQ4_&amp;sig=xSiYejTyzLitKsvmeed5I5dgh-8&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=F92kTZP4CMT2rAGXx_CHCw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CCkQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=Grand%20Duke%20nicholas%201905%20dictatorship&amp;f=false Scenarios of Power, From Alexander II to the Abdication of Nicholas II], by Richard Wortman, pg. 398&lt;/ref&gt; [[Grand Duke Nicholas]], threatened to shoot himself in the head if the Tsar did not accept Witte's suggestion.&lt;ref name="wortman398"/&gt; Nicholas unwillingly agreed, and issued what became known as the [[October Manifesto]] on {{OldStyleDateNY|30 October|17 October}} 1905, promising basic civil rights and an elected parliament called the Duma, without whose approval no laws were to be enacted in Russia in the future.

Accordingly, three proposed drafts were prepared for a revision of Speransky's Fundamental Laws. The Tsar chose to accept the draft authored by Peter Kharitonov, Deputy State Secretary of the State Chancellory, as the basis for the new constitution. Other constitutions from [[Austria-Hungary]], [[Japan]] and [[Prussia]] were also studied, as was a draft constitution authored by the Union of Liberation, and published abroad.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.answers.com/topic/fundamental-laws-of-1906 Russian Fundamental Laws of 1906], Great Encyclopedia of Russian History.&lt;/ref&gt;  The State Chancellory prepared a draft, which was discussed during five sessions of the Council of Ministers, where alterations were made to further strengthen the emperor's prerogatives at the expense of the new parliament. Following this, the draft was further discussed and amended under the Tsar's chairmanship; Nicholas chose to officially publish this new constitution on {{OldStyleDateNY|6 May|23 April}} 1906. With this act, Russia was officially transformed from an absolute monarchy into a constitutional one, though the exact extent of just ''how'' constitutional quickly became the subject of debate, based upon the emperor's subsequent actions.

==Provisions==
The Russian Constitution of 1906 contained an introduction and eleven chapters:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imperialhouse.ru/en/dynastyhistory/dinzak1.html Russian Fundamental Laws of 1906]&lt;/ref&gt; comprising a total of 124 articles:

*'''The Introduction''' (Articles 1-3) declared that Russia was "one and indivisible",&lt;ref&gt;Article 1.&lt;/ref&gt; and mandated the use of Russian in the armed forces and other public institutions.&lt;ref&gt;Article 3.&lt;/ref&gt;  It also acknowledged the [[Grand Duchy of Finland|Grand Principality of Finland]] as an "inseparable part of the Russian state", while ambiguiously acknowledging its special legislative and political status.&lt;ref&gt;Article 2.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Chapter One''' (Articles 4-24) concerned "the essence of the supreme autocratic power", declaring that the emperor possessed "supreme sovereign power", and that obedience to his commands was mandated by [[God]] himself.&lt;ref&gt;Article 4.&lt;/ref&gt;  It provided for the ruler's prerogatives, while making him personally inviolable.&lt;ref&gt;Article 5.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Tsar possessed an absolute veto over all legislation,&lt;ref&gt;Article 9.&lt;/ref&gt; legislative initiative on all matters,&lt;ref name="Article 8"&gt;Article 8.&lt;/ref&gt; and the sole prerogative to initiate any revision of the constitution itself.&lt;ref name="Article 8"/&gt; The emperor had charge over Russia's administrative and external affairs,&lt;ref&gt;Articles 10-13.&lt;/ref&gt; and sole power to declare war, make peace and negotiate treaties,&lt;ref&gt;Article 13.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the supreme command of the armed forces.&lt;ref&gt;Articles 13 and 14.&lt;/ref&gt;  The emperor also retained authority over the [[mint (coin)|mint]]ing of money,&lt;ref&gt;Article 16.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the right to grant pardons and quash judicial proceedings.&lt;ref&gt;Article 23.&lt;/ref&gt;  He appointed and dismissed his ministers at will, and decided the nature and scope of their duties.&lt;ref&gt;Articles 17 and 18.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Chapter Two''' (Articles 25-39) regulated the order of succession to the throne.  The thrones of [[Congress Poland|Poland]] and [[Grand Duchy of Finland|Finland]] were declared "inseparable" from that of Russia,&lt;ref&gt;Article 26.&lt;/ref&gt; while precise rules on succession to the throne were spelled out. Females were eligible to succeed, though they were placed last in order behind all dynastically qualified male descendants of Romanov emperors.&lt;ref&gt;Article 27.&lt;/ref&gt;  A female ruler was guaranteed all the prerogatives and privileges of the imperial office, though her consort was not to take the title of "emperor".&lt;ref&gt;Chapter One, Article 6.&lt;/ref&gt;  Children born to a marriage between a [[dynasty#Dynasts|dynastic]] [[Romanov]] and a person "not of corresponding dignity" (defined as "not belonging to any royal or sovereign house") were ineligible for the throne,&lt;ref&gt;Article 36&lt;/ref&gt; as was any person who inherited the throne while ruling over another nation whose state religion was not Orthodox, if unwilling to renounce that other throne and faith.&lt;ref&gt;Article 35.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Chapter Three''' (Articles 40-82) concerned issues of [[regent|regency]] and [[guardianship]], if the emperor was a [[minor (law)|minor]]. The [[age of majority]] was established at sixteen,&lt;ref&gt;Article 40.&lt;/ref&gt; and instructions were given concerning the appointment of a regent and a mandatory&lt;ref&gt;Article 47.&lt;/ref&gt; regency council, together with the prerogatives exercised by the same.
*'''Chapter Four''' (Articles 53-56) concerned accession to the throne and the Oath of Allegiance to be sworn by all male citizens of the empire, aged twenty and above,&lt;ref&gt;Explanatory Note 2, at end of this chapter.&lt;/ref&gt; each "according to his faith and law".&lt;ref&gt;Article 56.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Chapter Five''' (Articles 57-58) concerned the [[Coronation of the Russian monarch|coronation and anointing]] of a new sovereign, which was to take place "according to the rite of the Greco-Russian Orthodox Church."&lt;ref&gt;Article 57.&lt;/ref&gt;  Explanatory Note 1 at the end of this chapter indicated that the emperor was conjointly crowned [[Emperor of Russia]] and [[King of Poland]]. Explanatory Note 2 required him to recite the [[Nicene Creed]] according to the [[Orthodox Christian]] formula (without the [[filioque]] clause), and mandated a specific prayer for him to recite during the ceremony while wearing the [[Imperial Crown of Russia]] and holding the [[sceptre]] and [[Globus cruciger|orb]].
*'''Chapter Six''' (Articles 59-61) concerned the many formal titles held by the Russian sovereign, together with the precise makeup of the Russian state [[coat of arms]] and [[seal (emblem)|seal]].
*'''Chapter Seven''' (Articles 62-68) concerned the relationship of the Russian state to the various religions professed by its subjects. The Orthodox faith was declared the state religion,&lt;ref&gt;Article 62.&lt;/ref&gt; and both the emperor and his or her consort were required to profess that religion.&lt;ref&gt;Article 63.&lt;/ref&gt; The Tsar was named as the "supreme defender and guardian" of the [[Russian Orthodox Church]],&lt;ref&gt;Article 64.&lt;/ref&gt; while those of other confessions were promised full religious liberty,&lt;ref&gt;Article 66.&lt;/ref&gt; which was also extended to "Jews, Muslims and heathens."&lt;ref&gt;Article 67.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Repin 17October.jpg|right|thumb|400px|[[Ilya Repin]], ''17 October 1905.''  Russians celebrating the granting of the [[October Manifesto]] by [[Nicholas II of Russia|Nicholas II]], which led to the granting of the 1906 Constitution.]]
*'''Chapter Eight''' (Articles 69-83) concerned the "rights and obligations" of Russian citizens. Citizens were guaranteed protection from arbitrary arrest and imprisonment,&lt;ref&gt;Articles 72-74.&lt;/ref&gt; the inviolability of their domiciles,&lt;ref name="Article 75"&gt;Article 75.&lt;/ref&gt; protection from illegal search and seizure,&lt;ref name="Article 75"/&gt; the right to travel (subject to restriction),&lt;ref&gt;Article 76.&lt;/ref&gt; and the right to own private property.&lt;ref&gt;Article 77.&lt;/ref&gt;  Other rights promised in the document included freedom of assembly,&lt;ref&gt;Article 78.&lt;/ref&gt; freedom of expression,&lt;ref&gt;Article 79.&lt;/ref&gt; to organize unions and similar organizations,&lt;ref&gt;Article 80.&lt;/ref&gt; and freedom of religion.&lt;ref&gt;Article 81.&lt;/ref&gt;  Military service was mandatory for all male subjects called to it, regardless of social rank,&lt;ref&gt;Article 70.&lt;/ref&gt; and payment of taxes and performance of "other duties in accordance with lawful decrees" was required.&lt;ref&gt;Article 71.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Chapter Nine''' (Articles 84-97) concerned the promulgation of laws. Article 86 required the approval of the emperor, Duma and State Council for all laws, while Article 87 permitted the Tsar and his cabinet to issue decrees during times when the Duma was not in session. However, these lost their validity if not introduced to the new Duma within two months of its convocation, or if the new Duma or Council refused to confirm them. This article furthermore prohibited the emperor from using this authority to change the Constitution itself, or to change the laws for election to the Duma or Council. Nicholas' violation of this provision during the so-called [[Coup of June 1907]] would irreparably damage his reputation among Russian liberals, and led many to conclude that the entire Russian Constitution was ultimately a sham.&lt;ref&gt;[http://revolution.allbest.ru/languages/00109340_0.html Lessons from Russian parliamentary history, early twentieth century]&lt;/ref&gt; This contributed to more revolutionary agitation, and to the Tsar's eventual overthrow in February 1917.
*'''Chapter Ten''' (Articles 98-119) regulated the ''modus operandi'' of the State Council and Duma. Both were required to meet at least once per year, though the duration of their sessions and the length of their recess were the emperor's prerogative.&lt;ref&gt;Articles 98 and 99, respectively.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Tsar was granted the right to appoint up to one-half of the membership of the State Council,&lt;ref&gt;Article 100.&lt;/ref&gt; while members of the Duma were to be elected for a five-year term according to the state election statutes.&lt;ref&gt;Article 101.&lt;/ref&gt;  Both houses possessed equal rights in legislative matters,&lt;ref&gt;Article 106.&lt;/ref&gt; while either or both of them could be dissolved at any time by the emperor, though new elections for the Duma must be announced at the same time as its dissolution.&lt;ref&gt;Articles 104 and 105.&lt;/ref&gt;  Both houses possessed the right of legislative initiative, save in respect to the constitution itself; amendments to the constitution could only be proposed by the monarch.&lt;ref&gt;Article 107.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Imperial Court Ministry was not subject to the Duma's control.&lt;ref&gt;Article 115.&lt;/ref&gt; Securing of governmental loans was also beyond the legislature's purview,&lt;ref&gt;Article 118.&lt;/ref&gt; nor was it permitted to refuse or reduce funds to repay such obligations.&lt;ref&gt;Article 114.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Duma was equally prohibited from using its budgetary power to deny manpower requests from the [[Imperial Russian Army|Army]] or [[Imperial Russian Navy|Navy]]; should the legislature not approve such a petition, the military was allowed to call a new number of draftees equal to the previous year's number.&lt;ref&gt;Article 119.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Chapter Eleven''' (Articles 120-124) concerned the Council of Ministers. It established the office of [[Chairman of the Council of Ministers of Russia|Chairman of the Council of Ministers]],&lt;ref&gt;Article 123.&lt;/ref&gt; and made all members of this council responsible to the emperor for their actions.&lt;ref&gt;Articles 123 and 124.&lt;/ref&gt; "Regulations, instructions or orders" issued by this council, or any member thereof, could not contradict existing law.&lt;ref&gt;Article 122.&lt;/ref&gt; Ministers could be interrogated by either the State Council or Duma for their actions while in office,&lt;ref&gt;Chapter Ten, Article 108.&lt;/ref&gt; but only the Tsar could remove them.&lt;ref&gt;Chapter One, Articles 10 and 17.&lt;/ref&gt; The Russian system did not offer any right of [[impeachment]] to the legislative branch of government.

==Abolition of the 1906 constitution==
With [[February Revolution|the abdication of Tsar Nicholas in February 1917]] (Old Style), the government of Russia was initially taken over by a [[Russian Provisional Government|Provisional Government]] established by the Fourth Duma. [[Alexander Kerensky]], who became the most prominent leader of this government, unilaterally abolished the Russian monarchy on 15 September 1917, thereby formally abrogating the 1906 Constitution. In October Russia was [[October Revolution|taken over]] by the [[Bolshevik]] party, leading ultimately to the establishment of the [[Union of Soviet Socialist Republics]] on 30 December 1922. Prior to that time, the Communists had enacted a [[Russian Constitution of 1918|new constitution]], firmly establishing Russia as a Bolshevik state. This was in turn superseded by the [[1924 Soviet Constitution]] and the constitutions of 1937 and 1978, the last of which lasted until the [[fall of the Soviet Union]] and the adoption of Russia's [[Constitution of Russia|current governing document]] in 1993, under which the nation is currently governed.

In [[Religion in ancient Rome|ancient Roman religion]] and [[Roman law|law]], the '''''sacramentum''''' was an [[oath]] or vow that rendered the swearer ''[[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#sacer|sacer]],'' "given to the gods," in the negative sense if he violated it.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jörg Rüpke]], ''Domi Militiae: Die religiöse Konstruktion des Krieges in Rom'' (Franz Steiner, 1990), pp. 76–80.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Sacramentum'' also referred to a thing that was pledged as a sacred [[wikt:bond|bond]], and consequently forfeit if the oath were violated.&lt;ref&gt;D. Briquel "Sur les aspects militaires du dieu ombrien Fisus Sancius" in ''Revue de l' histoire des religions''{{full|date=November 2012}} i p. 150-151; J. A. C. Thomas ''A Textbook of Roman law'' Amsterdam 1976 p. 74 and 105.&lt;/ref&gt; Both instances imply an underlying ''sacratio'', act of consecration.

The ''sacramentum'' differs from  ''iusiurandum'', which is more common in legal application, as for instance swearing an oath in court. A ''sacramentum'' establishes a direct relation between the person swearing (or the thing pledged in the swearing of the oath) and the gods; the ''iusiurandum'' is an oath of good faith within the human community that is in accordance with ''[[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#ius|ius]]'' as witnessed by the gods.&lt;ref&gt;[[Arnaldo Momigliano]], ''Quinto contributo alla storia degli studi classici e del mondo antico'' (Storia e letteratura, 1975), vol. 2, pp. 975–977; Luca Grillo, ''The Art of Caesar's Bellum Civile: Literature, Ideology, and Community'' (Cambridge University Press, 2012), p. 60.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Sacramentum'' is the origin of the English word "[[sacrament]]", a transition in meaning pointed to by [[Apuleius]]'s use of the word to refer to [[mystery religions|religious initiation]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Apuleius]], ''[[The Golden Ass|Metamorphoses]]'' 11.15.5; Robert Schilling, "The Decline and Survival of Roman Religion," in ''Roman and European Mythologies'' (University of Chicago Press, 1992, from the French edition of 1981)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal usage==
In Roman law, a thing given as a pledge or bond was a ''sacramentum''. The ''sacramentum legis actio'' was a sum of money deposited in a legal procedure&lt;ref&gt;Varro ''De Lingua latina'' V 180; Festus s.v. ''sacramentum'' p. 466 L; 511 L; Paulus Festi Epitome p.467 L.&lt;/ref&gt; to affirm that both parties to the litigation were acting in good faith.&lt;ref&gt;George Mousourakis, ''A Legal History of Rome'' (Routledge, 2007), p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt; If correct law and procedures had been followed, it could be assumed that the outcome was ''iustum'', right or valid. The losing side had thus in effect committed [[perjury]], and forfeited his ''sacramentum'' as a form of ''[[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#piaculum|piaculum]]'', an expiatory sacrifice; the winner got his deposit back. The forfeited ''sacramentum'' was normally allotted by the state to the funding of ''[[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#sacra|sacra publica]]'', public religious rites.&lt;ref&gt;Mousourakis, ''A Legal History of Rome'', pp. 33, 206.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Military oath==
The ''sacramentum militare'' (also as ''militum'' or ''militiae'') was the oath taken by soldiers in pledging their loyalty to the [[Roman consul|consul]] in the [[Roman Republic|Republican era]] or later to the [[Roman emperor|emperor]]. The ''sacramentum'' as pertaining to both the law and the military indicates the religious basis for these institutions.

The text of the oath was recorded by [[Flavius Vegetius Renatus|Vegetius]]:&lt;ref&gt;Vegetius 2.5.&lt;/ref&gt;
:''Iurant autem milites omnia se strenue facturos quae praeceperit imperator, numquam deserturos militiam nec mortem recusaturos pro Romana republica''! 
:("But the soldiers swear that they shall faithfully execute all that the Emperor commands, that they shall never desert the service, and that they shall not seek to avoid death for the Roman republic!")

The ''sacramentum'' that renders the soldier ''sacer'' helps explain why he was subjected to harsher penalties, such as execution and corporal punishment, that were considered inappropriate for civilian citizens, at least under the Republic.&lt;ref&gt;See further discussion at ''[[fustuarium]]''&lt;/ref&gt; In effect, he had put his life on deposit, a condition also of the fearsome ''sacramentum'' sworn by [[gladiator]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Gladiators swore to commit their bodies to the possibility of being "burned, bound, beaten, and slain by the sword"; [[Petronius]], ''Satyricon'' 117; Seneca, ''Epistulae'' 71.32.&lt;/ref&gt; In the rare case of punishment by [[Decimation (Roman army)|decimation]], the surviving [[legionaries]] were often required to renew their oath, affirming the role of state ''[[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#religio|religio]]'' as the foundation of Roman [[military discipline]].

By the 3rd century the ''sacramentum'' was administered annually, on January 3, as attested by the calendar of state ritual discovered at [[Dura-Europos]], the so-called ''[[Feriale Duranum]]'', which dates to the reign of [[Severus Alexander]] (222-235 CE).&lt;ref&gt;A.D. Nock, "The roman army and the Roman religious year", ''Harvard Theological Review'' '''45''' (1952:187-252).&lt;/ref&gt; In the later empire, the oath of loyalty created conflict for Christians serving in the military, and produced a number of [[military saints|soldier-martyrs]].&lt;ref&gt;Carlin A. Barton, ''The Sorrows of the Ancient Romans: The Gladiator and the Monster'' (Princeton University Press, 1993), pp. 14–16, 35 (note 88), 42, 45–47.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tertullian]] condemned any Christian soldier's willingness to swear the ''sacramentum'', since [[baptism]] was the only [[sacrament]] a Christian should observe.&lt;ref&gt;Tertullian, ''De corona''{{full|date=November 2012}}, as noted by Paul Stephenson, ''Constantine, Roman Emperor, Christian Victor'', 2010:58.&lt;/ref&gt;

His areas of research include the psychology of prejudice and discrimination, judgment and decision making, international security and counter-terrorism, interactive web-based research, and the human use of animals and the environment. He is also the founder of the Social Psychology Network.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.socialpsychology.org/plous.htm Socialpsychology.org]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://newsletter.blogs.wesleyan.edu/2009/05/19/700k-nsf-grant-will-transform-plous-website/ Newsletter.blog.wesleyan.edu]&lt;/ref&gt;

Plous coined the term “action teaching” in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;Plous, S. (2000). Responding to overt displays of prejudice: A role-playing exercise. Teaching of Psychology, 27, 198-200.  (For a free copy, visit  www.understandingprejudice.org/pdf/roleplay.pdf)&lt;/ref&gt;  In this article he presented action teaching as the pedagogical counterpart to action research, a term coined by [[Kurt Lewin]] in the aftermath of World War II (Marrow, 1969). This experience of action teaching, he says, “leads not only to a better understanding of psychology but to a more just, compassionate and peaceful  world.”  &lt;ref&gt;Azar, B. (2008, December). Bringing lessons to life. Monitor on Psychology, 39, 56-58. (For a free copy, visit  www.socialpsychology.org/pdf/action-teaching.pdf)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, he published a study that evaluated the reliability of [[Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee]]s (IACUCs), and found that animal testing standards in the United States are widely inconsistent across different research institutions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.socialpsychology.org/articles/scipress.htm Study Finds Inconsistency in Animal Research Reviews], Wesleyan University; July 27, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

Plous has published two books, and numerous journal articles, on social issues, animal rights, and psychology. He is best known as a founder of [[Social Psychology Network]], a suite of nonprofit web sites supported by the [[National Science Foundation]], created in 1996. Currently Plous also teaches social psychology online through [[Coursera|Coursera's]] MOOC&lt;ref&gt;https://www.coursera.org/course/socialpsychology/&lt;/ref&gt;

In Judaism, '''''shechita''''' (anglicized: {{IPAc-en|ʃ|ə|x|iː|ˈ|t|ɑː|}}; {{lang-he-n|{{linktext|שחיטה}}}}; {{IPA-he|ʃχiˈta|}}; also [[Romanization of Hebrew|transliterated]] ''shehitah, shechitah, shehita'') is slaughtering of certain mammals and birds for food according to ''[[kashrut]]'' ({{bibleverse||Deut.|12:21|HE}}, {{bibleverse||Deut.|14:21|HE}}, {{bibleverse||Num.|11:22|HE}}).

==Biblical source==
The [[Torah]] ({{bibleverse||Deut.|12:21|HE||}}) states that sheep and cattle should be slaughtered "as I have instructed you" but nowhere in the [[Five books of Moses]] are any of the practices of ''shechita'' described.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Essential Talmud|last=Steinsaltz|first=Adin|publisher=|year=June 17, 1976|isbn=|location=|pages=224-225}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, they have been handed down in Judaism's traditional [[Oral Torah]], and codified in [[halakha]].

==Species==
{{main|Kashrut#Permitted and forbidden animals}}
The animal must be of a permitted species. For mammals, this is restricted to [[ruminants]] which have [[Cloven hoof|split hooves]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Shulchan Aruch]], [[Yoreh De'ah]] 79&lt;/ref&gt; For birds, although biblically any species of bird not specifically excluded in {{Bibleverse||Deuteronomy|14:12–18}} would be permitted,&lt;ref name = "Zivotofsky1"&gt;

Fish do not require kosher slaughter to be considered kosher, but are subject to other laws found in {{Bibleverse||Leviticus|11:9–12}}which determine whether or not they are kosher.

== Shochtim ==
In the [[Talmud]]ic era (beginning in 200 CE with the [[Jerusalem Talmud]] and 300 CE with the [[Babylonian Talmud]] and extending through the medieval ages), rabbis started to debate and define kosher laws. As the laws increased in number and complexity, following [[ritual slaughter]] laws became difficult for Jews who were not trained in those laws. This resulted in the need for a ''shochet'' (someone who has studied shechita extensively) to perform the slaughtering in the communities.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The ''shochtim'' (plural of ''shochet'') study which slaughtered animals are kosher, what disqualifies them from being kosher, and how to prepare animals according to the laws of shechita. Subjects of study include the preparation of slaughtering tools, ways to interpret which foods follow the laws of shechita, and types of ''[[Terefah|terefot]]'' (unfit kosher animals).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Shochtim studied under rabbis to learn the laws of shechita. Rabbis acted as the academics who, among themselves, debated how to apply laws from the Torah to the preparation of animals. Rabbis also conducted experiments to determine under which terefot animals were no-longer kosher. Shochtim studied under these rabbis, as rabbis were the officials who first interpret, debate, and determine the laws of shechita.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Shochtim are essential to every Jewish community, so they earn elevated social status. In medieval ages, the shochtim were treated as second in social status, just underneath rabbis. Shochtim were respected for committing their time to studying and for their importance to their communities.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Procedure==
[[File:Shalom Koboshvili. Slaughtering poultry according to religious rules. Oil on canvas. 70.5×101 cm. 1940.jpg|thumb|Slaughtering poultry according to religious rules, [[Shalom Koboshvili]], 1940]]

The procedure, which must be performed by a ''shochet'' ({{lang|he|[[:wikt:שוחט|שוחט]]}}), involves severing the [[Vertebrate trachea|trachea]], [[esophagus]]&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh,_Yoreh_De'ah.21?lang=bi|title=Shulchan Arukh, Yoreh De'ah 21 |last=|first=|date=|website= [[Sefaria]]|access-date=2017-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; and, crucially, the large blood vessels of the neck, in a swift action using a [[#The knife|special knife]] with an extremely sharp blade.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh,_Yoreh_De'ah.6?lang=bi|title=Shulchan Arukh, Yoreh De'ah 6 |website= [[Sefaria]]|access-date=2017-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The procedure may be performed with the animal either lying on its back ({{lang|he|שחיטה מוונחת}}, ''shechita munachat'') or standing ({{lang|he|שחיטה מעומדת}}, ''shechita me'umedet'').&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sefaria.org/Mishneh_Torah,_Ritual_Slaughter.2.7?lang=bi&amp;with=all&amp;lang2=en|title=Mishneh Torah, Ritual Slaughter 2:7 |website= [[Sefaria]]|access-date=2017-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In the case of fowl (with the exception of large fowl like Turkey) the bird is held in the non-dominant hand in such a way that the head is pulled back and the neck exposed, while the cut made with the dominant hand.&lt;ref&gt; Sefer Beit David 24:4
&lt;/ref&gt;

The procedure is done with the intention of causing a rapid drop in blood pressure in the brain and loss of consciousness, to render the animal insensitive to pain and to [[Exsanguination|exsanguinate]] in a prompt and precise action.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/222240/jewish/What-is-Shechita.htm What is Shechita?] chabad.org&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.shechitauk.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Physiological_insights_into_Shechita__S.D.Rosen__Veterinary_Record_2004_01.pdf?x55307 S. D. Rosen. Physiological Insights into Shechita.'' The Veterinary Record''  June 12, 2004'']&lt;/ref&gt; However, severing the carotid arteries and jugular veins does not cut blood flow to the brain of a bovine, because the brain is supplied with blood also by vertebral arteries. &lt;ref&gt;Zdun, M., Frąckowiak, H., Kiełtyka-Kurc, A., Kowalczyk, K., Nabzdyk, M. and Timm, A. (2013), The Arteries of Brain Base in Species of Bovini Tribe. Anat. Rec., 296: 1677–1682. doi:10.1002/ar.22784&lt;/ref&gt;

If one did not sever the entirety of both the [[Vertebrate trachea|trachea]] and [[esophagus]], then an animal may still be considered kosher as long as one severed the majority of the [[Vertebrate trachea|trachea]] and [[esophagus]] (windpipe and food pipe) of a mammal, or the majority of either one of these in the case of birds.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The cut must be incised with a back and forth motion without violating one of the five major prohibited techniques&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh,_Yoreh_De'ah.23?lang=bi|title=Shulchan Arukh, Yoreh De'ah 23 |website= [[Sefaria]]|access-date=2017-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; (see [[#Forbidden techniques|below]]), or various other detailed rules.

==Forbidden techniques==
*'''Shehiyah''' ({{Hebrew|שהייה}}; delay or pausing) - Pausing during the incision and then starting to cut again makes the animal's flesh unkosher.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh,_Yoreh_De'ah.23.2?lang=bi&amp;with=all&amp;lang2=en|title=Shulchan Arukh, Yoreh De'ah 23:2 |website= [[Sefaria]]|access-date=2017-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The knife must be moved across the neck in an uninterrupted motion until the [[Vertebrate trachea|trachea]] and [[esophagus]] are sufficiently severed to avoid this.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; There is some disagreement among legal sources as to the exact length of time needed to constitute shehiyah, but today the normative practice is to disqualify a kosher cut as a result of any length of pausing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh,_Yoreh_De'ah.23.2?lang=bi&amp;with=all&amp;lang2=en|title=Shulchan Arukh, Yoreh De'ah 23:2 |last=|first=|date=|website= [[Sefaria]]|others=Rama's commentary on Shulchan Aruch 23-2 requires strict adherence to disqualifying any pause.|access-date=2017-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*'''Derasah''' ({{Hebrew|דרסה}}; pressing/chopping) - The knife must be drawn across the throat by a back and forth movement, not by chopping, hacking, or pressing without moving the knife back and forth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh,_Yoreh_De'ah.24.1?lang=bi&amp;with=all&amp;lang2=en|title=Shulchan Arukh, Yoreh De'ah 24:1 |website= [[Sefaria]]|access-date=2017-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are those&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=20027&amp;st=&amp;pgnum=173|title=שו"ת תשובות והנהגות ח"ד - שטרנבוך, משה (page 173 of 568)|website=www.hebrewbooks.org|access-date=2017-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; who assert that it is forbidden to have the animal in an upright position during shechita due to the prohibition of derasah. They maintain that the animal must be on its back or lying on its side, and some also allow for the animal to be suspended upside down.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://forward.com/news/12666/shackle-and-hoist-kosher-slaughter-comes-under-01274/|title=Widespread Slaughter Method Scrutinized for Alleged Cruelty|work=The Forward|access-date=2017-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Rambam explicitly permits upright slaughter,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sefaria.org/Mishneh_Torah,_Ritual_Slaughter.2.7?lang=bi&amp;with=all&amp;lang2=en|title=Mishneh Torah, Ritual Slaughter 2:7 |website= [[Sefaria]]|access-date=2017-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Orthodox Union as well as all other major kosher certifiers in the United States accept upright slaughter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.star-k.org/articles/kashrus-kurrents/548/a-cut-above-shechita-in-the-crosshairs-again/|title=A Cut Above: Shechita in the Crosshairs, Again {{!}} STAR-K Kosher Certification|last=|first=|date=|website=www.star-k.org|at=A standing Matter|language=en-US|access-date=2017-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
*'''Haladah''' ({{Hebrew|חלדה}}; covering, digging, or burying) - The knife must be drawn over the throat so that the back of the knife is at all times visible while shechita is being performed. It must not be stabbed into the neck or buried by fur, hide, feathers, the wound itself, or a foreign object (such as a scarf) which may cover the knife.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh,_Yoreh_De'ah.24.7?lang=bi&amp;with=all&amp;lang2=en|title=Shulchan Arukh, Yoreh De'ah 24:7 |website= [[Sefaria]]|access-date=2017-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*'''Hagramah''' ({{Hebrew|הגרמה}}; cutting in the wrong location) - Hagramah refers to the location on the neck on which a kosher cut may be performed; cutting outside this location will in most cases disqualify a kosher cut.&lt;ref name="24:12"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh,_Yoreh_De'ah.24.12?lang=bi&amp;with=all&amp;lang2=en|title=Shulchan Arukh, Yoreh De'ah 24:12|website= [[Sefaria]]|access-date=2017-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to today's normative Orthodox practice, any cutting outside this area will in all cases disqualify a kosher cut.&lt;ref  name="24:12"/&gt; The limits within which the knife may be applied are from the large ring in the windpipe to the top of the upper lobe of the lung when it is inflated, and corresponding to the length of the pharynx. Slaughtering above or below these limits renders the meat unkosher.
*'''Iqqur''' ({{Hebrew|עיקור}}; tearing) - If either the esophagus or the trachea is torn during the shechita incision, the carcass is rendered unkosher. Iqqur can occur if one tears out the esophagus or trachea while handling an animal's neck or if the esophagus or trachea is torn by a knife with imperfection/s on the blade, such as nicks or serration.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh,_Yoreh_De'ah.24.15?lang=bi&amp;with=all&amp;lang2=en|title=Shulchan Arukh, Yoreh De'ah 24:15|website= [[Sefaria]]|access-date=2017-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.grandin.com/ritual/rules.shechita.proper.cut.html |title=The rules of Shechita for performing a proper cut during kosher slaughter (Rabbi Chanoch Kesselman, Temple Grandin, meat scientist) |publisher=Grandin.com |date= |accessdate=2014-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/13531-shehitah |title=Article: '&amp;#39;Shehitah'&amp;#39; Jewish Encyclopedia 1906 |publisher=Jewishencyclopedia.com |date= |accessdate=2014-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to avoid tearing, the kosher slaughter knife is expertly maintained and regularly checked with the shochet's fingernail to ensure that no nicks are present.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thekosheromnivoresquest.com/blog/deconstructing-kosher-slaughter-part-2-the-basics|title=Deconstructing Kosher Slaughter Part 2: The Basics|website=The Kosher Omnivore's Quest|access-date=2017-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Breaching any of these five rules renders the animal ''[[nevelah]]''; the animal is regarded in Jewish law as if it were [[carrion]].

[[Temple Grandin]] has observed that "if the rules (of the five forbidden techniques) are disobeyed, the animal will struggle. If these rules are obeyed, the animal has little reaction."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The rules of Shechita for performing a proper cut during kosher slaughter|url = http://www.grandin.com/ritual/rules.shechita.proper.cut.html|website = www.grandin.com|accessdate = 2015-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The knife==
[[File:Shechita.JPG|thumb|Shechita slaughter of a [[chicken]]]]

The knife used for shechita is called a ''sakin'' ({{Hebrew|סכין}}), or alternatively a ''hallaf'' ({{Hebrew|חלף}}) by [[Ashkenazi Jews]]. By biblical law the knife may be made from anything not attached directly or indirectly to the ground and capable of being sharpened and polished to the necessary level of sharpness and smoothness required for shechita. The [[Minhag]] now is to use a metal knife.

The knife must be at least slightly longer than the neck width but preferably at least twice as long as the animal's neck is wide, but not so long that the weight of the knife is deemed excessive. If the knife is too large, it is assumed to cause ''Derasah'', excessive pressing. Kosher knife makers sell knives of differing sizes depending on the animal. Shorter blades may technically be used depending on the number of strokes employed to slaughter the animal, but the normative practice today is that shorter blades are not used. The knife must not have a point. It is feared a point may slip into the wound during slaughter and cause ''Haladah'', covering, of the blade. The blade may also not be serrated, as serrations cause ''Iqqur,'' tearing.

The blade may not have imperfections in it. All blades are assumed by Jewish law to be imperfect, so the knife must be checked before each session. In the past the knife was checked through a variety of means. Today the common practice is for the shochet to run his fingernail up and down both sides of the blade and on the cutting edge to determine if he can feel any imperfections. He then uses a number of increasingly fine abrasive stones to sharpen and polish the blade until it is perfectly sharp and smooth. After the slaughter, the shochet must check the knife again in the same way to be certain the first inspection was properly done, and to ensure the blade was not damaged during shechita. If the blade is found to be damaged, the meat may not be eaten by Jews. If the blade falls or is lost before the second check is done, the first inspection is relied on and the meat is permitted.

In previous centuries, the hallaf was made of forged steel, which was not reflective and was difficult to make both smooth and sharp. [[Shneur Zalman of Liadi]], fearing that [[Sabbateans]] were scratching the knives in a way not detectable by normal people, introduced the [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidic]] ''hallaf''{{nnbsp}} ({{transl|yi|hasidishe hallaf}}). It differs from the previously-used knife design because it is made of molten steel and polished to a mirror gloss in which scratches could be seen as well as felt. The new knife was controversial and one of the reasons for the 1772 [[excommunication]] of the Hasidim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Vertheim|first=Aharon|title=Law and Custom in Hasidism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_n-Hb634XUIC&amp;pg=PA302|year=1992|publisher=KTAV Publishing House, Inc.|isbn=978-0-88125-401-3|pages=302–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other rules==
The animal may not be [[Stunning|stunned]] prior to the procedure, as is common practice in non-kosher modern [[animal slaughter]] since the early twentieth century.

It is forbidden to [[Prohibition against slaughtering an animal and its offspring on the same day|slaughter an animal and its young on the same day]].&lt;ref&gt; {{bibleverse||Leviticus|22:28|HE||}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
An animal's "young" is defined as either its own offspring, or another animal that follows it around, even if of another species.

The animal's blood may not be collected in a bowl, a pit, or a body of water, as these resemble ancient forms of [[idolatry|idol worship]].

If the shochet accidentally slaughters with a knife dedicated to idol worship, he must remove an amount of meat equivalent to the value of the knife and destroy it. If he slaughtered with such a knife on purpose, the animal is forbidden as not kosher.

==Post-procedure requirements==

===Bedikah===
The carcass must be checked to see if the animal had any of a specific list of internal injuries that would have rendered the animal a [[terefah|treifah]] before the slaughter. These injuries were established by the Talmudic Rabbis as being likely to cause the animal to die within 12 months time. Today all mammals are inspected for lung [[Adhesion (medicine)|adhesion]]s ({{transl|he|bedikat ha-reah}} "examination of the lung") and other disqualifying signs of the lungs, and most kosher birds will have their intestines inspected for infections. Further inspection of other parts of the body may be performed depending on the stringency applied and also depending on whether any signs of sickness were detected before slaughter or during the processing of the animal.

====Glatt====
''Glatt'' ({{lang-yi|גלאַט}}) and ''halak'' ({{lang-he|חלק}}) both mean "smooth". In the context of kosher meat, they refer to the "smoothness" (lack of blemish) in the internal organs of the animal. In the case of an [[Adhesion (medicine)|adhesion]] on a cow’s lungs specifically, there is debate between [[Ashkenazi Jews|Ashkenazic]] customs and [[Sephardi Jews|Sephardic]] customs. While there are certain areas of the lung where an adhesion is allowed, the debate revolves around adhesions which do not occur in these areas.

Ashkenazic Jews rule that if the adhesion can be removed (there are various methods of removing the adhesion, and not all of them are acceptable even according to the Ashkenazic custom) and the lungs are still airtight (a process that is tested by filling the lungs with air and then submerging them in water and looking for escaping air), then the animal is still kosher but not ''glatt''. If, in addition, there were two or fewer adhesions, and they were small and easily removable, then these adhesions are considered a lesser type of adhesion, and the animal is considered ''glatt''.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.yeshiva.co/ask/?id=6507&lt;/ref&gt; Ashkenazi custom permits eating non-''glatt kosher'' meat, but it is often considered praiseworthy to only eat ''glatt'' kosher meat.&lt;ref name="yhb"&gt;http://en.yhb.org.il/2012/02/17/the-difference-between-glatt-and-kosher-meat/&lt;/ref&gt;

Sephardic Jews rule that if there is any sort of adhesion on the forbidden areas of the lungs, then the animal is not kosher. This standard is commonly known as ''halak [[Beit Yosef (book)|Beit Yosef]]''. It is the strictest in terms of which adhesions are allowed.

The [[Moses Isserles|Rema]] (an Ashkenazi authority) had an additional stringency, of checking adhesions on additional parts of the lung which Sephardi practice does not require. Some Ashkenazi Jews keep this stringency.&lt;ref name="yhb"/&gt;

===Nikkur {{anchor|Porging}}===
''Porging''{{refn|group=note|The English word ''porge'' is from [[Judeo-Spanish]] ''porgar'' (from Spanish {{lang|es|purgar}} "to purge").&lt;ref&gt;{{Merriam-Webster|porge}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Hebrew is ''nikkur'' (''niqqur'') and the Yiddish is ''treibering''. This is done by a ''menaḳḳer'' (Yiddish).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/12288-porging |title=Porging |publisher=Jewish Encyclopedia |date= |accessdate=2014-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} refers to the halakhic requirement to remove the carcass's [[veins]], ''[[chelev]]'' ([[caul fat]] and [[suet]])&lt;ref&gt;[[Mishneh Torah]] ''Kedushah'', ''Forbidden Foods'' 8:1&lt;/ref&gt; and [[sinews]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Mishneh Torah]] ''Kedushah'', ''Forbidden Foods'' 6:1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/12288-porging |title=Porging |work=Jewish Encyclopedia 1905 |publisher=Jewishencyclopedia.com |date= |accessdate=2014-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Torah]] prohibits the eating of certain fats, so they must be removed from the animal. These fats are typically known as ''chelev''. There is also a biblical prohibition against eating the [[sciatic nerve]] (''[[gid hanasheh]]''), so that, too, is removed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The removal of the ''chelev'' and the ''gid hanasheh'', called ''[[nikkur]]'', is considered complicated and tedious, and hence labor-intensive, and even more specialized training is necessary to perform the act properly. While the small amounts of ''chelev'' in the front half of the animal are relatively easy to remove, the back half of the animal is far more complicated, and it is where the sciatic nerve is located.

In countries such as the United States, where there exists a large nonkosher meat market, the [[Cut of beef#Hindquarter cuts|hindquarters]] of the animal (where many of these forbidden meats are located) is often sold to non-Jews, rather than trouble with the process. This tradition goes back for centuries&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kashrut.com/articles/nikkur/ What's the Truth about Nikkur Achoraim?] kashrut.com, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; where local Muslims accept meat slaughtered by Jews as consumable; however, the custom was not universal throughout the [[Muslim world]], and some Muslims (particularly on the [[Indian subcontinent]]) did not accept these hindquarters as [[halal]]. In [[Israel]], on the other hand, specially trained men are hired to prepare the hindquarters for sale as kosher.

===Blood removal===
Because of the biblical prohibition of eating blood ({{bibleverse||Gen|9:4|KJV}}, {{bibleverse||Lev|17:10–14|KJV}}, {{bibleverse||Deut|12:23–24|KJV}}), all blood must be promptly removed from the carcass. All large arteries and veins are removed, as well as any bruised meat or coagulated blood. Then the meat is ''kasher''ed, a process of soaking and salting the meat to draw out all the blood. If this procedure is not performed promptly, the blood is considered to have “set” in the meat, and the meat is no longer salvageable to eat except when prepared through broiling with appropriate drainage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wikihow.com/Kosher-Meat |title=Wikihow. How to Kasher Meat |publisher=Wikihow.com |date= |accessdate=2014-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Giving of the Gifts===
{{main|foreleg, cheeks and maw}}
A [[Biblical commandment]] states a shochet must give the [[foreleg, cheeks and maw]] to a [[Kohen]] even though he does not own the meat. Thus, it is desirable that the shochet refuse to perform the shechita unless the animal's owner expresses his agreement to give the gifts. [[Beth din|Betei din]] (Rabbinical courts) have the authority to [[Herem (censure)|excommunicate]] a shochet who refuses to perform this commandment.

The [[Rishonim]] point out the Shochet cannot claim that, since the animal does not belong to him, he cannot give the gifts without the owner's consent. On the contrary, since the average shochet is reputed to be well versed and knowledgeable in the laws of Shechitah ("Dinnei Shechita"), Beith Din relies on him to withhold his shechita so long as the owner refuses to give the gifts:

{{quote|The obligation of giving the gifts lay upon the Shochet to separate the parts due to the Kohanim.  Apparently, the reasoning is that since the average Shochet is a "[[Talmid Chacham|Friend]]", since he completed the prerequisite of understanding the (complex) laws of Shechita and Bedikah.  It is assumed that he -as well- is knowledgeable in the details of the laws of giving the gifts, and will not put the [[Mitzvah]] aside.  This, however, is not the case with the animal's owner, since the average owner is an [[Am ha'aretz|Am ha-aretz]] not wholly knowledgeable in the laws of the gifts -and procrastinates in completing the Mitzvah''|Shulchan Gavoah to Yoreh Deah 61:61}}

==Covering Of The Blood==

it is a positive commandment incumbent upon the shochet to cover the blood of חיות (non-domesticated animals) and עופות (birds) but not בהמות (domesticated animals).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sefaria.org/Mishneh_Torah%2C_Ritual_Slaughter.14?lang=he Mishnah Torah, laws of kosher slaughter 14:1]&lt;/ref&gt; The shochet is required to place dirt on the ground before the slaughter and then to perform the cut over that dirt in order to drop some of the blood on to the prepared dirt. When the shechita is complete, the shochet grabs a handful of dirt, says a blessing and then covers the blood. The meat is still Kosher if the blood does not get covered; the covering of the blood is a separate mitzvah which does not affect the kosher status of the meat.

==Animal welfare controversies==
{{see also|Legal aspects of ritual slaughter}}

===General description of controversy===
The practices of handling, restraining, and unstunned slaughter have been criticized by, among others, animal welfare organizations such as [[Compassion in World Farming]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ciwf.org.uk/news/compassion_news/plea_on_unstunned_halal_and_kosher_meat.aspx |title=Compassion in World Farming: Unstunned Hallal and Kosher Meat (with link to collected reports) |publisher=Ciwf.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2014-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The UK [[Farm Animal Welfare Council]] said that the method by which Kosher and [[Halal]] meat is produced causes "significant pain and distress" to animals and should be banned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/end-cruel-religious-slaughter-say-scientists-1712241.html | location=London |work=The Independent  | first=Martin | last=Hickman | date=22 June 2009 | title=End 'cruel' religious slaughter, say scientists}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to FAWC it can take up to two minutes after the incision for cattle to become insensible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fawc.org.uk/reports/pb8347.pdf |title=Farm Animal Welfare Council: Report on the Welfare of Farmed Animals at Slaughter or Killing Part 1: Red Meat Animals |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2014-01-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130531191226/http://www.fawc.org.uk/reports/pb8347.pdf |archivedate=31 May 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Compassion in World Farming]] also supported the recommendation saying "We believe that the law must be changed to require all animals to be stunned before slaughter."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/talking_point/2977678.stm |title=BBC: Should Halal and Kosher meat be banned? |publisher=BBC News |date=16 June 2003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/2977086.stm |title=BBC: Halal and Kosher slaughter 'must end' |publisher=BBC News |date=10 June 2003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The UK government opted not to follow FAWC's recommendations after pressure from religious leaders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kirby |first=Terry |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/government-backs-down-on-religious-slaughter-ban-558596.html |title=Government backs down on religious slaughter ban'&amp;#39;The Independent'&amp;#39; |work=The Independent  |date=2 April 2004 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Federation of Veterinarians of Europe]] has issued a position paper on slaughter without prior stunning, calling it "unacceptable."&lt;ref&gt;[{{cite web|url=http://www.fve.org/news/position_papers/animal_welfare/fve_02_104_slaughter_prior_stunning.pdf|format=PDF|publisher=Federation of Veterinarians of Europe|title=Slaughter of Animals Without Prior Stunning}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nick Cohen]], writing for the ''[[New Statesman]]'', discusses research papers collected by Compassion in World Farming which indicate that the animal suffers pain during the process.&lt;ref name = "TNS"&gt;{{cite journal

| quote        = Possible reasons for the suffering are laid out in various research papers that Compassion in World Farming has collected. After the throat is cut, large clots can form at the severed ends of the carotid arteries, leading to occlusion of the wound (or "ballooning" as it is known in the slaughtering trade). Occlusions slow blood loss from the carotids and delay the decline in blood pressure that prevents the suffering brain from blacking out. In one group of calves, 62.5 per cent suffered from ballooning. Even if the slaughterman is a master of his craft and the cut to the neck is clean, blood is carried to the brain by vertebral arteries, and it keeps cattle conscious of their pain.
}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, Craig Johnson and colleagues showed that calves that have not been stunned feel pain from the cut in their necks,&lt;ref name=GibsonEtAl2009&gt;{{cite journal|author1=TJ Gibson|author2=CB Johnson|author3=JC Murrell|author4=CM Hulls|author5=SL Mitchinson|author6=KJ Stafford|author7=AC Johnstone|author8=DJ Mellor|title=Electroencephalographic responses of halothane-anaesthetised calves to slaughter by ventral-neck incision without prior stunning|journal=New Zealand Veterinary Journal|date=13 Feb 2009|volume=57|issue=2|pages=77–83|doi=10.1080/00480169.2009.36882}}&lt;/ref&gt; and they may take at least 10–30 seconds to lose consciousness.&lt;ref name=Coghlan2009&gt;{{cite news|author1=Andy Coghlan|title=Animals feel the pain of religious slaughter|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn17972-animals-feel-the-pain-of-religious-slaughter.html|accessdate=21 January 2015|agency=New Scientist|date=13 Oct 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has led to prohibitions against unstunned slaughter in some countries.

Generally these arguments are rejected by the Jewish community, who say that the method is humane and that criticism is at least partially motivated by [[antisemitism]]. A [[Knesset]] committee announced (January, 2012) that it would call on European parliaments and the [[European Union]] to put a stop to attempts to outlaw kosher slaughter.
"The pretext [for this legislation] is preventing cruelty to animals or animal rights – but there is sometimes an element of anti-Semitism and there is a hidden message that Jews are cruel to animals," said Committee Chair MK [[Danny Danon]] ([[Likud]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Harman |first=Danna |url=http://www.haaretz.com/jewish-world/israeli-knesset-committee-seeks-end-to-european-bans-on-kosher-slaughter-1.406578 |title=Israeli Knesset committee seeks end to European bans on kosher slaughter '&amp;#39;Ha'aretz'&amp;#39; Knesset Committee on Immigration, Absorption and Diaspora Affairs chair says attempts to outlaw 'Shechita' contain 'anti-Semitic' elements.

[[Research|Studies]] and [[experiment]]s cited on the Jewish internet site [[Chabad.org]] include one conducted in 1994 by Dr. [[Temple Grandin]] - an [[Associate Professor]] of [[Animal Science]] at [[Colorado]] and a study completed in 1992 by Dr. Flemming Bager, Head of the [[Danish Veterinary Laboratory]], which showed that when the animals were slaughtered in a comfortable position they appeared to give no resistance and none of the animals attempted to pull away their head. The studies concluded that the animals had no pain and were not even aware that their throats were cut.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Is Shechita Humane?|url=http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/222248/jewish/Is-Shechita-Humane.htm|work=Dr. Temple Grandin,  Dr. Flemming Bager -|publisher=Chabad.org|accessdate=2014-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Temple Grandin]] – a leading designer of animal handling systems – gives various research times for loss of consciousness via kosher and [[halal]] ritual slaughter and elaborates on what parts of the process she finds may or may not be cause for concern.&lt;ref name = "TG1"&gt;{{cite web

For this reason, "under the leadership of Grandin, research into animal welfare during slaughter has shifted away from examination of different techniques of stunning to a focus on auditing the performance of actual slaughter plants operating under commercial conditions."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Rushen |editor1-first=Jeffrey |editor2-last=de Passile |editor2-first=Anne Marie |editor3-last=von Keyserlingk |editor3-first=Marina A.G. |display-editors = 3 |editor4-last=Weary |editor4-first=Daniel M. |year=2008 |title=The Welfare of Cattle |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OEp52JU9IEwC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=JVYZU8-9GYnmoAT9-oGYCw&amp;ved=0CCsQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |page=140 |location=Dordrecht, The Netherlands |publisher=Springer |isbn=9781402065583 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Efforts to improve conditions in shechita slaughterhouses===
Temple Grandin is opposed to shackling and hoisting as a method of handling animals and wrote, on visiting a shechita slaughterhouse, "I will never forget having nightmares after visiting the now defunct [[Spencer Foods]] plant in [[Spencer, Iowa]], fifteen years ago. Employees wearing football helmets attached a nose tong to the nose of a writhing beast suspended by a chain wrapped around one back leg. Each terrified animal was forced with an [[cattle prod|electric prod]] to run into a small stall which had a slick floor on a forty-five degree angle. This caused the animal to slip and fall so that workers could attach the chain to its rear leg [in order to raise it into the air]. As I watched this nightmare, I thought, 'This should not be happening in a civilized society.' In my diary I wrote, 'If hell exists, I am in it.' I vowed that I would replace the plant from hell with a kinder and gentler system."&lt;ref&gt;Temple Grandin ''Thinking in Pictures. My Life with Autism''&lt;/ref&gt;

Efforts are made to improve the techniques used in slaughterhouses. Temple Grandin has worked closely with Jewish slaughterers to design handling systems for cattle, and has said: "When the cut is done correctly, the animal appears not to feel it.  From an animal welfare standpoint, the major concern during ritual slaughter are the stressful and cruel methods of restraint (holding) that are used in some plants."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.grandin.com/ritual/rec.ritual.slaughter.html |title=Recommended Ritual Slaughter Practices |publisher=Grandin.com }}&lt;/ref&gt; When shackling and hoisting is used, it is recommended &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Handbook_of_Meat_and_Meat_Processing_Sec.html?id=1ZRCMRXbbwoC&amp;redir_esc=y |title=Handbook of Meat and Meat Processing, Second Edition. Y. H. Hui (editor) |publisher=Books.google.se |date= |accessdate=2014-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; that cattle not be hoisted clear of the floor until they have had time to bleed out.

===Agriprocessors controversy===
The prohibition of stunning and the treatment of the slaughtered animal expressed in shechita law limit the extent to which Jewish slaughterhouses can industrialize their procedures. The most industrialized attempt at a kosher [[slaughterhouse]], [[Agriprocessors]] of [[Postville]], [[Iowa]], became the center of controversy in 2004, after [[People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals]] released a gruesome undercover video of cattle struggling to their feet with their tracheas and esophagi ripped out after shechita. Some of the cattle actually got up and stood for a minute or so after being dumped from the rotating pen.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2004/11/30/national/30cnd-kosh.html?_r=0 The New York Times ''Videotapes Show Grisly Scenes at Kosher Slaughterhouse'' By DONALD G.

[[Tikkun Magazine]], March/April 2005, Vol. 20, No. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. [[Temple Grandin]], told [[Mason City, Iowa|Mason City]], [[Iowa]]'s ''[[Globe Gazette]]'', "I thought it was the most disgusting thing I'd ever seen. I couldn't believe it. I've been in at least 30 other kosher slaughter plants, and I had never ever seen that kind of procedure done before. … I've seen kosher slaughter really done right, so the problem here is not kosher slaughter. The problem here is a plant that is doing everything wrong they can do wrong."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.peta.org/features/agriprocessors.aspx |title=PETA Reveals Extreme Cruelty at Kosher Slaughterhouses |publisher=Peta.org |date= |accessdate=2014-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; While Agriprocessors has been criticized by both secular and Jewish organizations for both its [[human rights|human]] and [[animal rights]] violations, the [[Jewish Orthodox Union]] (OU) made note to point out that the [[kashrut]] of a product is not contingent upon "the conditions in which it is produced. {{citation needed|date=May 2013}} The OU's condonation of Agriprocessors as a possibly inhumane, yet appropriately [[Shechita#Glatt|glatt kosher]] company has led to discussion as to whether or not industrialized agriculture has undermined the place of [[halakha]] (Jewish law) in shechita as well as whether or not halakha has any place at all in Jewish ritual slaughter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Fishkoff|first= Sue|title= Kosher Nation|location= New York|publisher= Schocken|year= 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Simla Accord''', or the '''Convention Between Great Britain, China, and Tibet, [in] Simla''',&lt;ref name="Conven1914"&gt;[http://www.tibetjustice.org/materials/treaties/treaties16.html "Convention Between Great Britain, China, and Tibet, Simla (1914)"], [[Tibet Justice Center]]. Retrieved 20 March 2009&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[treaty]] concerning the status of [[Tibet]] negotiated by representatives of the [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republic of China]], [[Tibet (1912–1951)|Tibet]] and the [[United Kingdom]] in [[Shimla|Simla]] in 1913 and 1914.

The Accord provided that Tibet would be divided into "Outer Tibet" and "Inner Tibet". Outer Tibet, which roughly corresponded to [[Ü-Tsang]] and western [[Kham]], would "remain in the hands of the Tibetan Government at Lhasa under Chinese [[suzerainty]]", but China would not interfere in its administration. "Inner Tibet", roughly, equivalent to [[Amdo]] and eastern Kham, would be under the jurisdiction of the Chinese government. The Accord with its annexes also defines the boundary between Tibet and [[China proper]] and between Tibet and British India (the latter became known as the [[McMahon Line]]).&lt;ref name="Conven1914"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Sinha-1974-12&gt;Sinha (Calcutta 1974), p. 12 (pdf p. 8)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Sinha group=lower-alpha&gt;The map was finalised on 24/25 March 1914 by the British and Tibetan plenipotentiaries. Indian sources currently claim that, on being informed of the line, the Chinese plenipotentiary did not express any disagreement.(Sinha, (Calcutta 1974), p. 12 (pdf p. 8))
{{quote|The two maps (27 April 1914 and 3 July 1914) illustrating the boundaries bear the full signature of the Tibetan Plenipotentiary; the first bears the full signature of the Chinese Plenipotentiary also; the second bears the full signatures along with seals of both Tibetan and British Plenipotentiaries.

&lt;/ref&gt;

China rejected the Accord and their [[plenipotentiary]], Ivan Chen, withdrew on 3 July 1914. The British and Tibetan plenipotentiaries then attached a note denying China any privileges under the Accord and sealed it as a bilateral agreement the same day.{{sfn|Goldstein|1991|p=837}}&lt;ref group=lower-alpha&gt;This Accord was initialled and sealed by the British plenipotentiary, A. Henry McMahon, and sealed by the Tibetan plenipotentiary Lochen Shatra but not the Chinese plenipotentiary, Ivan Chen, as he had withdrawn from the Convention before the Accord was initialled and sealed.([http://www.tibetjustice.org/materials/treaties/treaties16.html "Convention Between Great Britain, China, and Tibet, Simla (1914)"], [http://www.tibetjustice.org/index.html Tibet Justice Center] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090310103457/http://www.tibetjustice.org/index.html |date=10 March 2009 }}.

McMahon's work was initially rejected by the British government as incompatible with the 1907 [[Anglo-Russian Convention]]. This convention was renounced in 1921. The British began using the McMahon Line on [[Survey of India]] maps in 1937, and the Simla Accord was published officially in 1938.&lt;ref group=lower-alpha&gt;{{quote|The Simla Convention and its appended Indo-Tibetan agreement did not appear in Aitchison's Treaties (the official GOI record), including the final 1929 edition, since the unratified Simla Convention was not a valid international treaty and the Indo-Tibetan agreement was secret. The 1929 edition was withdrawn by a British Indian official, Olaf Caroe, in 1938, and a new edition was issued that included the Simla Convention and the McMahon-Shartra notes (but not the Anglo-Tibetan agreement or the McMahon Line map)|Smith, Warren, Tibetan Nation, p201, n163}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Early British efforts to create a boundary for north-east India were triggered by their discovery in the mid-19th century that [[Tawang]], an important trading town, was Tibetan territory.&lt;ref name="Calvin"&gt;Calvin, James Barnard, [http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/report/1984/CJB.htm "The China-India Border War"], Marine Corps Command and Staff College, April 1984&lt;/ref&gt; Britain had concluded treaties with [[Qing]] China concerning Tibet's boundaries with [[Burma]]&lt;ref name="Conven1886"&gt;[http://www.tibetjustice.org/materials/treaties/treaties8.html Convention Relating to Burmah and Tibet (1886)], [http://www.tibetjustice.org/index.html Tibet Justice Center] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090310103457/http://www.tibetjustice.org/index.html |date=10 March 2009 }}. Retrieved 20 March 2009&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Sikkim]].&lt;ref name="Conven1890"&gt;[http://www.tibetjustice.org/materials/treaties/treaties9.html "Convention Between Great Britain and China Relating to Sikkim and Tibet (1890)"], [http://www.tibetjustice.org/index.html Tibet Justice Center] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090310103457/http://www.tibetjustice.org/index.html |date=10 March 2009 }}. Retrieved 20 March 2009&lt;/ref&gt; However, Tibet refused to recognise the boundaries drawn by these treaties{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}. British forces led by Sir [[Francis Younghusband]] [[British expedition to Tibet|entered Tibet in 1904]] and made a treaty with the Tibetans.&lt;ref name="Conven1904"&gt;[http://www.tibetjustice.org/materials/treaties/treaties10.html "Convention Between Great Britain and Tibet (1904)"], [http://www.tibetjustice.org/index.html Tibet Justice Center] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090310103457/http://www.tibetjustice.org/index.html |date=10 March 2009 }}. Retrieved 20 March 2009&lt;/ref&gt; In 1907, Britain and Russia acknowledged Chinese "[[suzerainty]]" over Tibet.&lt;ref name=anglorussian1907&gt;[http://www.tibetjustice.org/materials/treaties/treaties12.html Convention Between Great Britain and Russia (1907)] Article II, [http://www.tibetjustice.org/index.html Tibet Justice Center] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090310103457/http://www.tibetjustice.org/index.html |date=10 March 2009 }}. Retrieved 20 March 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

British interest in the borderlands was renewed when the [[Qing]] government sent military forces to establish a Chinese administration in Tibet (1910–12). A British military expedition was sent into what is now [[Arunachal Pradesh]] and the [[North-East Frontier Agency]] was created to administer the area (1912). In 1912–13, this agency reached agreements with the tribal leaders who ruled the bulk of the region.&lt;ref&gt;See ''North East Frontier of India'' (1910 &amp; 1911 editions).&lt;/ref&gt; After the fall of the Qing dynasty in China, Tibet government at Lhasa expelled all Chinese forces and declared itself independent (1913),&lt;ref name="Goldstein30-1"&gt;{{harvnb|Goldstein|1997|pp=30–31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dalai"&gt;[http://www.tibetjustice.org/materials/tibet/tibet1.html "Proclamation Issued by His Holiness the Dalai Lama XIII (1913)"], [http://www.tibetjustice.org/index.html Tibet Justice Center] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090310103457/http://www.tibetjustice.org/index.html |date=10 March 2009 }}. Retrieved 20 March 2009&lt;/ref&gt; however, this was not accepted by the newly founded Republic of China.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Warren W., "''Tibetan Nation''", pp. 182–183&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conference==
[[File:西姆拉会议.jpg|thumb|Tibetan, British and Chinese participants and [[Plenipotentiary|plenipotentiaries]] to the Simla Treaty in 1914]]
In 1913, the British convoked a conference at [[Shimla|Simla]], India to discuss the issue of Tibet's status.&lt;ref name="maxwell"&gt;Maxwell 1970&lt;/ref&gt; The conference was attended by representatives of Britain, the newly founded [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republic of China]], and the Tibetan government at Lhasa.&lt;ref name="Conven1914"/&gt; The British plenipotentiary, Sir [[Henry McMahon (diplomat)|Henry McMahon]], introduced the plan of dividing Tibetan-inhabited areas into "inner Tibet" and "outer Tibet" and apply different policies.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} "Inner Tibet," which includes Tibetan-inhabited areas in Qinghai, Gansu, Sichuan and Yunnan provinces, would be under the jurisdiction of the Chinese government. "Outer Tibet," covering approximately the same area as the modern "[[Tibet Autonomous Region]]" would enjoy autonomy. A boundary between Tibet and British India, later called the [[McMahon Line]], was drawn on a map referred to in the treaty.&lt;ref name="Sinha-1974-12"/&gt;

The Tibetan Indian boundary was negotiated in Simla between representatives from Britain and Tibet privately, in the absence of the Chinese representative. During the Simla conference a map of the Tibetan Indian border was provided as an annexe to the proposed agreement.&lt;ref name="Calvin"/&gt;&lt;ref name="maxwell"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Sinha group=lower-alpha/&gt;&lt;ref name=globalsecurity group=lower-alpha&gt;{{quote|The line was marked on a large-scale (eight miles to the inch) map. On a much smaller-scale map, which was used in the discussions of the Inner Tibet-Outer Tibet boundary, the McMahon-Tibetan boundary (which would become the McMahon Line) was shown as a sort of appendix to the boundary between Inner Tibet and China proper (see Map Six,below).|Barnard 1984.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[s:Simla Accord (1914)#Schedule|Schedule appended to the Accord]] contained further notes. For example, it was to be understood that "Tibet forms part of Chinese territory" and after the Tibetans selected a Dalai Lama, the Chinese government was to be notified and the Chinese commissioner in Lhasa would "formally communicate to His Holiness the titles consistent with his dignity, which have been conferred by the Chinese Government"; that the Tibetan government appointed all officers for "Outer Tibet", and that "Outer Tibet" was not to be represented in the Chinese Parliament or any such assembly.&lt;ref name="Conven1914"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Goldstein75"&gt;{{harvnb|Goldstein|1991|p=75}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Negotiations failed when China and Tibet could not agree over the Sino-Tibetan boundary.&lt;ref&gt;Shakya 1999, pg. 5&lt;/ref&gt; After the Chinese plenipotentiary, Ivan Chen, withdrew from the convention, the British and Tibetan plenipotentiaries attached a note denying China any privileges under the agreement and signed it as a bilateral Accord.&lt;ref name="Goldstein75"/&gt; At the same time the British and Lochen Shatra signed a fresh set of trade Regulations to replace those of 1908.&lt;ref name=TibHist136&gt;McKay, Alex, ''The History of Tibet: The modern period: 1895–1959, the Encounter with modernity'', p. 136.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==

Simla was initially rejected by the Government of India as incompatible with the 1907 Anglo-Russian Convention. The official treaty record, C.U. Aitchison's ''A Collection of Treaties'', was published with a note stating that no binding agreement had been reached at Simla.&lt;ref name="Lin"&gt;Lin, Hsiao-Ting, "[http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/03068376708731991 Boundary, sovereignty, and imagination: Reconsidering the frontier disputes between British India and Republican China, 1914–47]", ''The Journal of Imperial &amp; Commonwealth History,'' September 2004, '''32''', (3).&lt;/ref&gt; Since the condition (agreement with China) specified by the accord was not met, the Tibetan government didn't agree with the McMahon Line.  &lt;ref name="Shakya1999"/&gt;


The Anglo-Russian Convention was renounced by Russia and Britain jointly in 1921,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.freetibet.org/about/uk-relations-tibet UK relations with Tibet], [http://www.freetibet.org/contact Free Tibet Campaign]. Retrieved 20 March 2009. "... in 1917, the Communist Government in Russia repudiated all the international engagements of the tsars, ... in 1921, the 1907 Treaty was cancelled by agreement."&lt;/ref&gt; but the McMahon Line was forgotten until 1935, when interest was revived by civil service officer [[Olaf Caroe]].&lt;ref name="Guruswamy"&gt;Guruswamy, Mohan, [http://www.rediff.com/news/2003/jun/21spec.htm "The Battle for the Border"], ''Rediff'', 23 June 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Survey of India]] published a map showing the McMahon Line as the official boundary in 1937.&lt;ref name="Guruswamy"/&gt; In 1938, the British published the Simla Convention in Aitchison's ''Treaties''.&lt;ref name="Lin"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Banerji, Arun Kumar, "[http://www.thestatesman.net/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=367249&amp;catid=38 China, The British And Tawang]", ''The Statesman'', 24 April 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; A volume published earlier was recalled from libraries and replaced with a volume that includes the Simla Convention together with an editor's note stating that Tibet and Britain, but not China, accepted the agreement as binding.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mssu.edu/projectsouthasia/history/primarydocs/Treaties/Tibet/Schedule1914.htm Schedule of the Simla Convention, 1914] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060912194623/http://www.mssu.edu/projectsouthasia/history/primarydocs/Treaties/Tibet/Schedule1914.htm |date=12 September 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The replacement volume has a false 1929 publication date.&lt;ref name="Lin"/&gt;

In April 1938, a small British force led by Captain G. S. Lightfoot arrived in Tawang and informed the monastery the district was now Indian territory.{{sfn|Goldstein|1991|p=307}} The Tibetan government protested and its authority was restored after Lightfoot's brief stay. The district remained in Tibetan hands until 1951.

In the late 1950s, the McMahon Line became a source of tension between China and India.&lt;ref name=barnettnyt&gt;Robert Barnett, ''[https://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/25/opinion/25barnett.html?hp Did Britain Just Sell Tibet?]'', [[The New York Times]], 24 November 2008&lt;/ref&gt; China contends that Tibet was never an independent state and so it could not sign a treaty on behalf of China to delineate an international frontier.&lt;ref&gt;Kaiyan Homi Kaikobad ''Interpretation and Revision of International Boundary'', Cambridge University Press, 2007, {{ISBN|0-521-86912-9}}, {{ISBN|978-0-521-86912-6}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=-rgZvL6WXFcC&amp;pg=PA37#PPA37,M1 pp. 36–38]&lt;/ref&gt; China and India fought the [[Sino-Indian War]] in 1962, which nevertheless preserved the [[status quo ante bellum]]. Australian journalist and historian Neville Maxwell exposed a top-secret Indian war report that harshly criticised the highest echelons of power in India at the time for pursuing a flawed strategy of provoking China into the war without the means to handle a backlash. The so-called Henderson Brooks-Bhagat Report was an operational review of India's military debacle commissioned by New Delhi that Maxwell managed to obtain. Compiled by Lieutenant-General Henderson Brooks and Brigadier Premindra Singh Bhagat in 1963, it has been kept secret by the Indian government despite repeated appeals that it be declassified. &lt;ref&gt; {{Cite news| url=http://m.scmp.com/news/asia/article/1461099/neville-maxwells-revelation-reveals-india-was-hiding-nothing-over-its-1962 |title=Neville Maxwell discloses document revealing that India provoked China into 1962 border war |publisher=South China Morning Post|date=6 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2008 British policy change===
Until 2008 the British Government's position remained the same that China held [[suzerainty]] over Tibet but not full [[sovereignty]]. It was the only state still to hold this view.&lt;ref name=economist-2008-11-24&gt;Staff, ''[http://www.economist.com/world/asia/displaystory.cfm?story_id=12570571 Britain's suzerain remedy]'', ''[[The Economist]]'', 6 November 2008&lt;/ref&gt; [[David Miliband]], the British Foreign Secretary, described the old position as an [[anachronism]] originating in the geopolitics of the early 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Lunn, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; Britain revised this view on 29 October 2008, when it recognised Chinese sovereignty over Tibet by issuing a statement on its website.&lt;ref group=lower-alpha&gt;[[David Miliband]], ''[http://www.fco.gov.uk/en/newsroom/latest-news/?view=PressS&amp;id=8299838 Written Ministerial Statement on Tibet (29/10/2008)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081202021442/http://www.fco.gov.uk/en/newsroom/latest-news/?view=PressS&amp;id=8299838 |date=2 December 2008 }}'', Foreign Office website. Retrieved 25 November 2008. {{quote|Our ability to get our points across has sometimes been clouded by the position the UK took at the start of the 20th century on the status of Tibet, a position based on the geo-politics of the time. Our recognition of China's "special position" in Tibet developed from the outdated concept of suzerainty. Some have used this to cast doubt on the aims we are pursuing and to claim that we are denying Chinese sovereignty over a large part of its own territory. We have made clear to the Chinese Government, and publicly, that we do not support Tibetan independence. Like every other EU member state, and the United States, we regard Tibet as part of the People's Republic of China. Our interest is in long term stability, which can only be achieved through respect for human rights and greater autonomy for the Tibetans.|British Foreign Sectary}}&lt;/ref&gt;''[[The Economist]]'' stated that although the British Foreign Office's website does not use the word sovereignty, officials at the Foreign Office said "it means that, as far as Britain is concerned, 'Tibet is part of China. Full stop.'"&lt;ref name=economist-2008-11-24/&gt;

The British Government sees their new stances as an updating of their position, while some others have viewed it as a major shift in the British position.&lt;ref name=Lunn-7 group=lower-alpha&gt;Lunn, p. 7 "However, in October 2008 there was what some have viewed as a major shift in the British position, although the Government sees it more as an updating of it. This involved abandoning the concept of 'Chinese suzerainty' on the grounds that it was unclear and out-dated."&lt;/ref&gt; Tibetologist Robert Barnett thinks that the decision has wider implications. India's claim to a part of its north-east territories, for example, is largely based on the same agreements – notes exchanged during the Simla convention of 1914, which set the boundary between India and Tibet – that the British appear to have simply discarded.&lt;ref name=barnettnyt/&gt;&lt;ref name=barnettnyt/&gt; It has been speculated that Britain's shift was made in exchange for China making greater contributions to the [[International Monetary Fund]].&lt;ref name=barnettnyt/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spectator.co.uk/search/author/?searchString=James%20Forsyth  Forsyth, James] (the web editor of ''[[The Spectator]]'').

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2886">[[File:OldSuffolkCMaCourt.JPG|thumb|right|The [[John Adams Courthouse]] houses the Social Law Library]]
The '''Social Law Library''', founded in 1803, is the second oldest [[law library]] in the [[United States]].  It is located in the [[John Adams Courthouse]] at [[Pemberton Square (Boston)|Pemberton Square]] in [[Boston, Massachusetts]], the same building which houses the [[Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court]] and the [[Massachusetts Appeals Court]].

==History==
The history of the library is very much bound up in the history of the Supreme Judicial Court itself.  Many of the proprietors of the library were chief justices of the Supreme Judicial Court, including [[Theophilus Parsons]], [[Lemuel Shaw]], [[Horace Gray]], and [[Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.]].  The library was also caught up in the debates between the [[Federalist Party (United States)|Federalists]], who wanted to see the [[common law]] (based on [[English law]]) received into the newly formed United States, and the [[Democratic-Republican Party (United States)|Jeffersonians]], who preferred to have a [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]]-based system similar to the [[Napoleonic Code]].  The Federalists, who were prominent in Boston and integral to the library's founding, began importing English law books for local lawyers to use.  The Supreme Judicial Court, needing a law library for their own use, permitted the library to be moved into the Court's offices in exchange for access to its many volumes.  Meanwhile, the [[Massachusetts General Court]] (the state legislature of Massachusetts) established the office of [[Reporter of Decisions]], which was the first office of its kind at the state level in the United States, and the first officially reported decision was ''[[Gold v. Eddy]]'' (1804).  This turn of events allowed the public greater access to the decisions of the courts of Massachusetts, and in turn popularized the [[common law]] legal system in the United States.

==Today==
Today, many lawyers in the Boston area use the library for [[legal research]].  Members pay a yearly fee for the privilege of being admitted to the library and using its facilities, with the exception of state, court or non-profit legal services organizations members.  The library has over 450,000 volumes of printed materials, most of which can be searched using an online catalog accessible via the library's web site.

[[File:Mongolia 1915.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Mongolia in 1915]]
Signed on 25 May 1915, the '''Treaty of Kyakhta''' was a tri-party treaty between [[Russian Empire|Russia]], [[Mongolia (1911–21)|Mongolia]], and [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|China]].

Russia and China recognized [[Outer Mongolia]]'s autonomy (as part of Chinese territory); Mongolia recognized China's suzerainty; Mongolia could not conclude international treaties with foreign countries regarding political and territorial questions.

The Mongolian representative, Prime Minister [[Tögs-Ochiryn Namnansüren]], was determined to stretch autonomy into [[de facto]] independence, and to deny the Chinese anything more than vague, ineffectual [[suzerain]] powers.  The Chinese sought to minimize, if not to end, Mongolian autonomy. Mongolians viewed the treaty as a disaster because it denied the recognition of a truly independent, [[Pan-Mongolism|all-Mongolian state]]. Nevertheless, Outer Mongolia remained effectively outside Chinese control&lt;ref&gt;Batsaikhan, O. The Last King of Mongolia, Bogdo Jebtsundamba Khutuktu. Ulaanbaatar: Admon, 2008, p.290-293 - {{ISBN|978-99929-0-464-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; and, according to explanation by baron B.E. Nolde, the Director of Law Section of the Russian Foreign Ministry, had all necessary attributes of the state in the international law of that time.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.academia.edu/12779988/%D0%9A%D1%83%D0%B7%D1%8C%D0%BC%D0%B8%D0%BD_%D0%A1.%D0%9B._2015._%D0%A1%D1%82%D0%BE%D0%BB%D0%B5%D1%82%D0%B8%D0%B5_%D0%9A%D1%8F%D1%85%D1%82%D0%B8%D0%BD%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%B3%D0%BE_%D1%81%D0%BE%D0%B3%D0%BB%D0%B0%D1%88%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%B8%D1%8F_1915_%D0%B3._%D0%BC%D0%B5%D0%B6%D0%B4%D1%83_%D0%A0%D0%BE%D1%81%D1%81%D0%B8%D0%B5%D0%B9_%D0%9C%D0%BE%D0%BD%D0%B3%D0%BE%D0%BB%D0%B8%D0%B5%D0%B9_%D0%B8_%D0%9A%D0%B8%D1%82%D0%B0%D0%B5%D0%BC_Kuzmin_S.L._2015._%D0%A1entenary_of_the_Kyakhta_Agreement_of_1915_between_Russia_Mongolia_and_China_ Kuzmin, S.L.

The treaty severely curtailed the independent status of Mongolia declared in 1911, but eventually became moot after the [[October Revolution]] of 1917, and the declaration of the [[Mongolian People's Republic]] in 1921.

'''''United States v. Morgan''''', 346 U.S. 502 (1954), is a landmark decision by the [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] which provides the writ of [[coram nobis]] as the proper application to request federal post-conviction judicial review for those who have completed the conviction's incarceration.

==Background==
The ancient writ of [[coram nobis]] originated in the English judicial system during the sixteenth century. If a court discovered a factual mistake or error after the conclusion of a case, the writ could be issued by the court to correct the error.  The writ of coram nobis was identical to the [[Habeas corpus in the United States|writ of habeas corpus]]; except, the writ of habeas corpus was reserved exclusively for those who were held in prisons, and the writ of coram nobis was available to everyone else.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scholarship.law.georgetown.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1113&amp;context=fwps_papers|title=''Stigma of Conviction: Coram Nobis, Civil Disabilities, and the Right to Clear One's Name''|last=Wolitz|first=David|date=July 2009|publisher=The BYU Law Review|access-date=April 30, 2017}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Judiciary Act of 1789]] provided courts in the United States the authority to issue [[writ|writs]] to achieve justice as long as the writ does not conflict with constitutional rights or legislative statutes.&lt;ref&gt;[[Judiciary Act of 1789]], 1 Stat. 81-82&lt;/ref&gt;  (In 1911, the authorization of the federal judiciary to issue writs was modified into 28 U. S. C. § 1651(a) and is known as the [[All Writs Act|“all-writs section of the Judicial Code”]].) In 1946, the writ of coram nobis was considered obsolete when Congress added Rule 60(e) to the [[Federal Rules of Civil Procedure]] which specifically abolished the writ of coram nobis in civil cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/frcp/rule_60|title=Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 60|website=www.law.cornell.edu|accessdate=2017-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Until this time, federal courts only used the writ of coram nobis to correct errors in federal civil cases because errors in federal criminal cases could be corrected with a writ of habeas corpus.  Thus, in its 1947 decision, ''United States v. Smith'', the Supreme Court observed “it is difficult to conceive of a situation in a federal criminal case today where [the writ of coram nobis] would be necessary or appropriate.” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=15350111847978931898|title=''United States v. Smith'', 331 US 469, 475 n.4 (1947)|website=Scholar.google.com|accessdate=2017-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Questions about whether the writ of coram nobis would be necessary or appropriate resurfaced just one year later with the Act of June 25, 1948 which codified existing federal habeas corpus statutes and provided only those individuals in-custody access to the writ of habeas corpus.&lt;ref&gt;[http://uscode.house.gov/statviewer.htm?volume=62&amp;page=967# Act of June 25, 1948]&lt;/ref&gt;  Prior to the Act of June 25, 1948, the writ of habeas corpus was the sole application for United States federal courts to review convictions of those who had completed their incarceration.  Following the Act of June 25, 1948, federal courts were left to decide whether the act eliminated any review of convictions for those who had completed their incarceration or whether the writ of coram nobis (which had been limited to reviews of civil cases in US federal courts) could be expanded to include reviews of criminal cases for those who had completed their incarceration.

''Morgan'' resolved these questions by determining that those who had completed their incarceration could challenge their conviction through the writ of coram nobis.  Although the Supreme Court states in ''Carlisle v. United States'', “it is difficult to conceive of a situation in a federal criminal case today where [the writ of coram nobis] would be necessary or appropriate [for prisoners and others serving out a term of a federal conviction],”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=11483498398561074985|title=''Carlisle v. United States'', 517 U.S. 416, 429 (1996)|website=Scholar.google.com|accessdate=2017-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Morgan'' provides when the writ of coram nobis is necessary or appropriate for those who are no longer in-custody.

==Case==
In 1939, nineteen-year-old Robert Patrick Morgan pled guilty to stealing three letters from the US Post Office and was sentenced in the [[United States District Court for the Northern District of New York]] to four years in federal prison; however, Morgan’s [[constitutional right|constitutional rights]] were violated because he was not provided an attorney nor did he waive his constitutional right to an attorney. Unfortunately for Morgan, he was unaware that his constitutional rights were violated until after he had completed his sentence. In 1950, Morgan was convicted of attempted burglary in a New York county court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scholarship.law.georgetown.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1113&amp;context=fwps_papers|title=''Stigma of Conviction: Coram Nobis, Civil Disabilities, and the Right to Clear One's Name''|last=Wolitz|first=David|date=July 2009|publisher=The BYU Law Review|access-date=April 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of his 1939 federal conviction, the county court applied New York’s Multiple Offenders Law and sentenced Morgan to seven to ten years at [[Attica Correctional Facility|Attica Prison]].

In 1952, Morgan first became aware of the constitutional violations related to his 1939 federal conviction. As a result, he petitioned the district court for the writ of coram nobis. If successful, his state sentence would be reduced because he would no longer be considered a multiple offender. The district court denied Morgan’s petition on the ground that the coram nobis petition was to be treated as a habeas corpus petition under 28 U.S.C. § 2255, which was unavailable to Morgan because he was no longer in federal custody. Morgan appealed the district court’s decision to the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit|Second Circuit Court of Appeals]]. The case was argued before the appellate court on January 13, 1953. On February 5, 1953, the three-judge panel unanimously determined that Morgan was entitled to the writ of coram nobis and reversed the district court’s decision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=11147499741758364560|title=''United States v. Morgan'', 202 F.2d 67, 69 (1953)|website=Scholar.google.com|accessdate=2017-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the appellate court’s decision, the attorney’s office for the United States petitioned and was granted a writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court.&lt;ref&gt;''United States v. Morgan'', 345 U. S. 974 (1953)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Decision==
[[File:Warren Court 1953.jpg|thumb|250px|right|In a 5-4 decision, the United States Supreme Court held that federal courts have the authority to issue the writ of coram nobis to those who are no longer in custody.]]''United States v. Morgan'' was argued on October 19, 1953 and decided January 4, 1954. In a 5-4 decision, the Court agreed with the Second Circuit and held that federal courts have the authority under the all-writs section of the Judicial Code to issue the writ of coram nobis to those who are no longer in custody.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/346/502/|title=''United States v.

* Federal District Courts, under the authority of the All-Writs Section, 28 U.S.C. § 1651(a), may issue the writ of coram nobis. ''id.'' at 506-510.
* A motion for a writ of coram nobis “is a step in the criminal case” and “is of the same general character as a motion under 28 U.S.C. § 2255.” ''id.'' at 505, n.4.
* A writ of coram nobis should be allowed only under circumstances compelling such action to achieve justice. ''id.'' at 511.
* If no other remedy is available and sound reasons existing for failure to seek appropriate earlier relief, a motion of the writ of coram nobis must be heard by the federal court. ''id.'' at 512.
* Since adverse consequences resulting from the conviction persist after conclusion of a sentence, the petitioner is entitled to show that his conviction was invalid.  ''id.'' at 512-513.

==Division of circuit courts==
[[File:US Court of Appeals and District Court map.svg|thumb|250px|right|Map of the United States Courts of Appeals]] Federal appellate courts are currently divided on the deadline to file an appeal of a district court’s decision of a case to petition for a writ of coram nobis. Most appellate courts provide 60 days to file an appeal; two other courts provide only 10 days to file an appeal. The source of this controversy is found in footnote 4 of the ''Morgan'' decision in which the Court held the writ of coram nobis “is a step in the criminal case” and also “of the same general character as one under 28 U.S.C. § 2255.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/346/502/case.html#F4|title=''United States v. Morgan'', 306 U.S. 502 (1954) footnote 4|website=supreme.justia.com|accessdate=2017-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit|Second]], [[United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit|Fifth]], [[United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit|Sixth]], [[United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit|Seventh]], and [[United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit|Tenth]] circuit courts held that the civil time limit should apply to coram nobis appeals because the writ of coram nobis is "of the same general character" as the writ of habeas corpus under 28 U.S.C. § 2255. Habeas corpus petitions follow time limit guidelines of the civil rule which provides a 60-day time period to file an appeal.&lt;ref&gt;Fed.R.App.P. 4(a)(1)&lt;/ref&gt; However, the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit|Eighth]] and [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit|Ninth]] circuit courts held that a writ of coram nobis is governed by the criminal time limit for filing appeals because it a "step in a criminal case." Criminal rules of appellate procedure only provide a 10-day time period to file an appeal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=12590893338640158916|title=''United States v.

'''''Weinberger v. Wiesenfeld''''', 420 U.S. 636 (1975),&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|name=Weinberger v. Wiesenfeld|420|636|1975}}. {{usgovpd}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a decision by the [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]], which unanimously held that the gender-based distinction under {{usc|42|402(g)}} of the [[Social Security Act]] of 1935—which permitted widows but not widowers to collect special benefits while caring for minor children—violated the right to equal protection secured by the [[Due Process Clause]] of the [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution]].

== Background ==

Stephen Wiesenfeld and Paula Polatschek were married in 1970.  Stephen ran a [[minicomputer]] consulting business and had an irregular income.  Paula taught mathematics at [[Edison High School (New Jersey)|Edison High School]] and earned significantly more than her husband.   When Paula died in childbirth from an [[Amniotic fluid embolism|amniotic embolism]], Stephen became the sole provider for their newborn son, Jason.&lt;ref name="strebeigh2009"&gt;{{cite book|last=Strebeigh|first=Fred|title=Equal: Women Reshape American Law|year=2009|publisher=Norton|isbn=0393065553}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|4-6}}  To take care of his son, Stephen cut his work hours and sought child care.  Wiesenfeld contested his ineligibility for Social Security survivors' benefits that were made available to widows, but not to widowers.

[[Rutgers School of Law – Newark|Rutgers Law School]] professor [[Ruth Bader Ginsburg]], along with Melvin Wulf, took on ''Weinberger v. Wiesenfeld'' after several unfavorable Supreme Court decisions on gender discrimination cases.  In 1974, ''[[Kahn v. Shevin]]'' had upheld differences in property tax exemption between widows and widowers, and the Supreme Court ruled in ''[[Geduldig v. Aiello]]'' that denying compensation from work loss due to pregnancy did not violate the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]].  Ginsburg looked to ''Weinberger v. Wiesenfeld'' to promote the idea of "the care of two loving parents, rather than just one."

Ginsburg made the argument that Section 402(g) of the [[Social Security Act]] discriminated against Stephen Wiesenfeld by not providing him with the same survivors' benefits as it would to a widow.  Further, Ginsburg argued that Paula's contributions to Social Security were not treated on an equal basis to salaried men, so she was also being discriminated against.

== Decision ==

The Court decided unanimously in favor of Wiesenfeld.  They declared that Section 402(g) of the Social Security Act was unconstitutional on the grounds that the gender based distinctions violated the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment. 

Justice Brennan wrote in the Court's opinion:
{{quote|Since the Constitution forbids the gender-based differentiation premised upon assumptions as to dependency made in the statutes before us in ''[[Frontiero v. Richardson|Frontiero]]'', the Constitution also forbids the gender-based differentiation that results in the efforts of female workers required to pay social security taxes producing less protection for their families than is produced by the efforts of men.}}

The Court differentiated the Social Security matter from the decision in ''Kahn v. Shevin''.  The court decided that Section 402(g):

{{quote|linked as it is directly to responsibility for minor children, was intended to permit women to elect not to work and to devote themselves to the care of children. Since this purpose in no way is premised upon any special disadvantages of women, it cannot serve to justify a gender-based distinction which diminishes the protection afforded to women who do work.}}

Wiesenfeld himself received no monetary benefits from the decision.  By the time he initiated the case, he had shut down his consulting business and obtained a well-paid position at a computer company.  His salary thus exceeded the income cutoff for receiving Social Security benefits.&lt;ref name="strebeigh2009"/&gt;{{rp|10}}

== Subsequent developments ==
Ginsburg helped highlight the idea that the social security provision had discriminated against men acting as caregivers, and women serving as breadwinners.  Brennan ruled that "such a gender-based generalization cannot suffice to justify the denigration...of women who do work and whose earnings contribute significantly to their families' support." The decision aimed to establish that it is just as important for a child to be cared for by the male parent, as they will encounter the same difficulties in parenting as the female parent.  The court's ruling challenged the traditional male breadwinner/female homemaker model in terms of allocating government benefits.

Though ''Weinberger v. Wiesenfeld'' was considered a victory for feminists, the court still was unclear on distinguishing between sex-based classifications that were damaging to women and those that nurtured sexual equality.  Gender based social security questions would continue to be explored further in cases such as ''[[Califano v. Goldfarb]]'', which Ginsburg was also involved in, and later in ''[[Califano v. Webster]]'', for which ''Weinberger v. Wiesenfeld'' had helped lay important groundwork.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="36677">The '''Western Oregon Indian Termination Act''' or [[Act of Congress|Public Law]] 588, was passed in August 1954 as part of the United States [[Indian termination policy]]. It called for termination of federal supervision over the trust and restricted property of numerous [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] bands and small tribes, all located west of the [[Cascade Mountains]] in [[Oregon]].&lt;ref name="PublicLaw588"&gt;''Public Law 588, August 13, 1954''. ''Indian Affairs: Laws and Treaties, Vol. VI'' (Washington: Government Printing Office), p. 641 [http://digital.library.okstate.edu/KAPPLER/vol6/html_files/v6p0641.html]&lt;/ref&gt;
The act also called for disposition of federally owned property which had been bought for the administration of Indian affairs, and for termination of federal services which these Indians received under federal recognition.&lt;ref name="PublicLaw588"/&gt; The stipulations in this act were similar to those of most termination acts.
{{horizontal TOC|nonum=yes|limit=2}}

==Tribes and bands==
The Western Oregon Indian Termination Act was unique because of the number of tribes it affected. In all, 61 tribes in [[Western Oregon]] were terminated, more than the total tribes terminated under all other individual acts.&lt;ref name="PublicLaw588"/&gt; However, it appears that authorities named every tribe that had been named in various treaties over the years. A review of the 1890&lt;ref name="www2.census.gov"&gt;http://www2.census.gov/prod2/decennial/documents/1890a_v10-25.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; and 1930 censuses shows that several of the named tribes in the termination act reported no members.&lt;ref name="1930 Census"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://books.google.com.mx/books?id=wKnv2sxSydwC&amp;lpg=PA43&amp;ots=qaV7LiWFC3&amp;dq=karok%20indian%20tribe%20in%20oregon&amp;pg=PA43#v=onepage&amp;q=karok%20indian%20tribe%20in%20oregon&amp;f=false|title= The Indian Population of the United States and Alaska, 1930, Volume 2
|editor=Truesdell, Leon Edgar |journal = United States Bureau of the Census |publisher=U.S. Government Printing Office|date=1937|accessdate=December 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the history of the area, with the [[Coast Indian Reservation|Coastal Reservation]] being established by Executive Order and not treaty, then separated into the [[Siletz Reservation|Siletz]] and [[Grand Ronde Community|Grande Ronde Reservations]], then those two reservations being combined, and yet again separated, makes the situation complicated and difficult to ascertain specific data.&lt;ref name="scholarsbank.uoregon.edu"&gt;https://scholarsbank.uoregon.edu/xmlui/bitstream/handle/1794/10067/Lewis_Daivd_Gene_phd2009wi.pdf?sequence=1&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1930 census report notes that there were people who reported that they were Indian but did not denote a tribe in almost every state. In addition, it combines groups into language stock and tribes; however, "tribe" may reflect all speakers rather than separate bands and tribes. The total number of Indians affiliated with the language groups were as follows:
*[[Athapaskan]] (1930= 504; 1910 =656) 
*[[Chinookan]] (1930= 561; 1910 =897)
*[[Kalapooian]] (1930= 45; 1910 = 106)
*[[Coosan languages|Kusan]] (1930= 107; 1910 =93)
*[[Salishan languages|Salish]] (1930= 9; 1910 = 18)
*[[Shastan languages|Shastan]] (1930= 138; 1910 =177)
*[[Waiilatpuan]] (1930= 193; 1910 =302) 
*[[Yakonan]] (1930= 7; 1910 =55) 
The totals in Oregon for 1930 were 1,564. In comparison, the numbers for the 1910 census for these same groups represented a population of 2,304.&lt;ref name="1930 Census"/&gt; On June 22, 1956, the final roll of the Confederated Tribes of Siletz contained 929 names.&lt;ref&gt;http://soda.sou.edu/awdata/021029d1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; On April 14, 1956, the Federal Register published the final roll of the Confederated Tribes of Grand Ronde which contained 862 names.&lt;ref name="Lewis: Termination of the Grand Ronde (2009)"&gt;&gt;{{cite web |url=https://books.google.com.mx/books?id=6dx-9l2v17wC&amp;lpg=PA217&amp;ots=a1gTwuAJG9&amp;dq=final%20roll%20of%20the%20Confederated%20Tribes%20of%20grand%20ronde&amp;pg=PA220#v=onepage&amp;q=final%20roll%20of%20the%20Confederated%20Tribes%20of%20grand%20ronde&amp;f=false|title= Termination of the Confederated Tribes of the Grand Ronde Community of Oregon: Politics, Community, Identity |first=David Gene|last= Lewis |publisher=University of Oregon|date=2009|accessdate=December 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The combined total of these two confederations' population was 1,791, though there may well have been scattered native peoples in the coastal region who were not affiliated with these reservations.

==Restoration acts==
There were five restoration acts that restored all of the bands who had tribe members that had been located on the Grand Ronde or Silez Reservations. Some of these tribes were restored with those acts and later obtained their own federal recognition. The [[Chinookan peoples|Chinook Indian Nation]], made up of 4 bands: the [[Kathlamet|Cathlamet]], [[Clatsop]], [[Wahkiakum people|Wahkiakum]] (in Washington State) and [[Lower Chinook|Lower Columbia Chinook]] (in Washington State) are seeking separate tribal recognition.
