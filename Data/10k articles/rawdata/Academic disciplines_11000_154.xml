      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2327">The '''amplitude modulation signalling system''' ('''AMSS''' or the '''AM signalling system''') is a [[Digital data|digital]] system for adding low [[bit rate]] information to an [[analog signal|analogue]] [[amplitude modulation|amplitude modulated]] [[broadcasting|broadcast]] signal in the same manner as the [[Radio Data System]] (RDS) for [[frequency modulation|frequency modulated]] (FM) broadcast signals.

This system has been standardized in March 2006 by [[ETSI]] (TS 102 386) as an extension to the [[Digital Radio Mondiale]] (DRM) system.

== Broadcasting ==
{{Outdated as of|year=2016|month=October|day=16|June 2011}}
AMSS data are broadcast from the following transmitters:

* [[longwave|LW]]
** RTL France: 234&amp;nbsp;kHz
* [[shortwave|SW]]
** [[BBC World Service]]: 15.575&amp;nbsp;MHz

Formerly it was also used by:

* [[medium wave|MW]]
** [[:de:Truckradio|Truckradio]] 531&amp;nbsp;kHz
** [[BBC World Service]]: 648&amp;nbsp;kHz
** [[Deutschlandradio Kultur]]: 990&amp;nbsp;kHz

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16035">'''Animal suicide''' refers to any kind of self-destructive behavior displayed by various species of animals, resulting in their death. Although contradicting the natural progression of life and an animal's evolutionary instinct for survival, some situations may lead to an animal inducing their own death. Animal suicide in the defense of the group could be instantaneous or altruistic self-removal once an animal becomes diseased.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shorter|first=J. R.|last2=Rueppell|first2=O.|date=2011-12-04|title=A review on self-destructive defense behaviors in social insects|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00040-011-0210-x|journal=Insectes Sociaux|language=en|volume=59|issue=1|pages=1–10|doi=10.1007/s00040-011-0210-x|issn=0020-1812}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are anecdotal reports of grieving pets displaying such behaviour after the death of their owner, or [[Monogamy in animals|monogamous animals]] refusing to feed after the death of their mate.

Some [[Parasitism|parasites]] manipulate the behavior of their [[Host (biology)|host]], causing them to expose themselves to greater risks of predation to enable the parasite to proceed to the next life-cycle stage. Some [[carpenter ant]]s and [[termite]]s use [[autothysis]], producing a sticky secretion to trap colony marauders, and [[pea aphid]]s will sometimes explode, protecting other pea aphids from ladybugs.

== Suicidal behavior ==
It is generally considered that humans are the only known beings to use weapons when putting an end to their own life. Some species might be driven to engage in suicidal behavior for the sake of others, this is an example of [[Altruism (biology)|altruism]] in animals. These actions are performed when the reproductive fitness of others outweighs the reproductive fitness of the individual.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Samir|first=Okasha,|date=2003-06-03|title=Biological Altruism|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2013/entries/altruism-biological/|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are examples of animals dying in defense of their family or colony, such as the case of pea aphids increasing their chances of death as a response to parasitism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McAllister|first=Murdoch K.|last2=Roitberg|first2=Bernard D.|year=1987|title=Adaptive Suicidal Behavior in Aphids|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v328/n6133/abs/328797b0.html|journal=Nature|volume=328|pages=797–799|doi=10.1038/328797b0|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Vervent monkeys will alert others when a predator is near, consequently drawing attention to itself and increasing their likelihood of being attacked.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Samir|first=Okasha,|date=2003-06-03|title=Biological Altruism|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2013/entries/altruism-biological/|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, 28 cows and bulls mysteriously threw themselves off a cliff in the [[Swiss Alps]] over the span of three days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Scientists baffled as 'suicidal' cows throw themselves off cliff in Switzerland|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1209638/Scientists-baffled-suicidal-cows-throw-cliff-Switzerland.html|accessdate=16 August 2013|newspaper=Daily Mail|date=28 August 2009|author =Mail Foreign Service}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{bettersource|date=May 2018}} One deer leapt from a cliff to its death so as to avoid being captured by [[hunting dog]]s.&lt;ref name="Palmer" /&gt; Another famous example of animal suicide is the case of the dolphin which most often portrayed Flipper, on the 1960s television show ''[[Flipper (1964 TV series)|Flipper]]''.

Animal suicide was long used to define human suicide; in the 1800s animal suicide was seen as an act of abuse, madness, love, or loyalty, the same acts human suicide was seen as.&lt;ref name="O'Hanlon"/&gt; Although it is impossible to determine what drives animals to self-destruction, some specific traits associated with human suicide can be successfully transferred to animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Malkesman|first=Oz|title=Animal Models of Suicide Trait-Related Behaviors|journal=Trends in Pharmacological Sciences|date=April 2009|volume=30|issue=4|pages=165–173|doi=10.1016/j.tips.2009.01.004|pmid=19269045|pmc=2788815|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scientists have been unable to explain whether animals are able to consciously end their own lives.&lt;ref name=Preti&gt;{{cite journal|last=Preti|first=A|title=Animal model and neurobiology of suicide|journal=Progress in Neuro-Psychopharmacology &amp; Biological Psychiatry|date=1 June 2011|volume=35|issue=4|pages=818–30|doi=10.1016/j.pnpbp.2010.10.027|pmid=21354241}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Self-destruction ==
{{See also|Autothysis}}
Some species of social insects will commit suicide in an act of altruism through [[autothysis]]. These insects will sacrifice themselves if the colony is in danger, to alert the colony of danger, or if they become diseased they will sacrifice themselves to prevent the colony from becoming diseased.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shorter|first=J. R.|last2=Rueppell|first2=O.|date=2011-12-04|title=A review on self-destructive defense behaviors in social insects|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00040-011-0210-x|journal=Insectes Sociaux|language=en|volume=59|issue=1|pages=1–10|doi=10.1007/s00040-011-0210-x|issn=0020-1812}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Carpenter ant]]s and some species of [[termite]] will rupture glands and expel a sticky toxic substance thought to be an aliphatic compound in a process called ''[[autothysis]]''. Termites will use autothysis to defend their colony, as the ruptured gland produces a sticky harmful secretion that leads to a [[tar baby]] effect in defense.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.springerlink.com/content/v0kjl37610tk2426/ Maschwitz, U. and E.

Some social Hymenoptera including bees, wasps, and ants, may use their stinger to deliver poisonous chemicals to their attacker, effectively killing both the predator and the insect in the colony's defense.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hermann|first=Henry R.|date=June 1971|title=Sting autotomy, a defensive mechanism in certain social Hymenoptera|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF02223116?LI=true|journal=Insectes Sociaux|language=en|volume=18|issue=2|pages=111–120|doi=10.1007/bf02223116|issn=0020-1812}}&lt;/ref&gt; This self-destructive and often altruistic defense is known as sting autonomy. The stinger is easily torn from the animal's body, allowing the hazardous stinger to be left stuck in the predator.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shorter|first=J. R.|last2=Rueppell|first2=O.|date=2011-12-04|title=A review on self-destructive defense behaviors in social insects|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00040-011-0210-x|journal=Insectes Sociaux|language=en|volume=59|issue=1|pages=1–10|doi=10.1007/s00040-011-0210-x|issn=0020-1812}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Suicide-inducing parasitism ==
Certain types of [[parasite]]s will cause their [[Host (biology)|hosts]] to commit suicidal behavior, through altering how the intermediate host acts. The change in the host's actions often benefit the parasite's search for a final host.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Moore|first=Janice|date=April 1984|title=Altered Behavioral Responses in Intermediate Hosts -- An Acanthoceptalan Parasite Strategy|url=https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/284224?journalCode=an|journal=The American Naturalist|language=en|volume=123|issue=4|pages=572–577|doi=10.1086/284224|issn=0003-0147}}&lt;/ref&gt; A main example is the phylum [[Acanthocephala]], which will direct its host to a predator so as to be eaten by the predator, their new definitive host. The parasitic worm ''[[Spinochordodes tellinii]]'' will develop in [[grasshopper]]s and [[Cricket (insect)|crickets]] until it is grown, at which time it will cause its host to leap into water to its death so that the worm can reproduce in water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article.ns?id=dn7927 |title=Parasites brainwash grasshoppers into death dive |publisher=[[New Scientist]] |date=August 31, 2005 |author =Shaoni Bhattacharya}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, ''S. tellinii'' only causes its host to drown when the host is already close to water as opposed to seeking it out over large distances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Do hairworms (Nematomorpha) manipulate the water seeking behaviour of their terrestrial hosts? |author1=F.

Infection with ''[[Toxoplasma gondii]]'' has been shown to alter the behavior of mice and rats in ways thought to increase the rodents’ chances of being preyed upon by cats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Webster |first1=JP |last2=McConkey |first2=GA |date=June 2010 |title=Toxoplasma gondii-altered host behaviour: clues as to mechanism of action |journal=Folia parasitologica |volume=57 |issue=2 |pages=95–104 |pmid=20608471 |doi=10.14411/fp.2010.012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Webster |first=J. P.|title=The Effect of ''Toxoplasma gondii'' on Animal Behavior: Playing Cat and Mouse |journal=Schizophrenia Bulletin |year=2007|volume=33 |issue=3 |pages=752–756 |doi=10.1093/schbul/sbl073 |pmid=17218613|pmc=2526137}}&lt;/ref&gt; Infected rodents show a reduction in their innate aversion to cat odors; while uninfected mice and rats will generally avoid areas marked with cat urine or with cat body odor, this avoidance is reduced or eliminated in infected animals. Moreover, some evidence suggests this loss of aversion may be specific to feline odors: when given a choice between two predator odors (cat or mink), infected rodents show a significantly stronger preference to cat odors than do uninfected controls.

Suicide induction in intermediate hosts has been shown to help disperse the parasites to their final hosts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Trail|first=Deborah R.

However, infected clams are concentrated in the higher parts of the tidal flats, closer to shore, and leave conspicuous zig-zag markings in the sand. Visual and tactile cues have shown to be used by oyster catchers and other shore birds, the definitive hosts of the parasite.

== Misconceptions ==
A popular misconception is that the [[lemming]] will commit [[mass suicide]] during migration. This misconception was first popularized by media in the 1960s, such as a mention in the [[Cyril M. Kornbluth]] short story "[[The Marching Morons]]" in 1951 and the 1955 comic "The Lemming with the Locket", inspired by a 1953 ''[[American Mercury]]'' article.&lt;ref&gt;Lederer, Muriel. "Return of the Pied Piper". ''[[The American Mercury]]'', [http://www.unz.org/Pub/AmMercury-1953dec-00033 Dec. 1953, pp. 33–4].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Blum, Geoffrey. 1996. "One Billion of Something", in: ''Uncle Scrooge Adventures by Carl Barks'', #9.&lt;/ref&gt; Perhaps one of the most influential factors in this misconception was the [[Academy Award]]-winning [[Disney]] film ''[[White Wilderness (film)|White Wilderness]]'', which showed staged footage of lemmings jumping off a cliff during migration.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.snopes.com/disney/films/lemmings.asp snopes.com: White Wilderness Lemmings Suicide&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Attainable region (AR) theory''' is a branch of [[chemical engineering]], specifically [[chemical reaction engineering]], that uses geometric and mathematical optimization concepts to assist in the design of networks of chemical reactors. AR theory is a method to help define the best reactor flowsheet using graphical techniques for a desired duty or objective function.&lt;ref name="UNISA Online"&gt;{{cite web|title=Reactor Systems Design (Attainable Regions)|url=http://www.unisa.ac.za/Default.asp?Cmd=ViewContent&amp;ContentID=97610|website=UNISA|accessdate=2 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Fogler &amp; Gurmen © 2008 University of Michigan"&gt;{{cite web|title=Attainable Region Theory – University of Michigan|url=http://www.umich.edu/~elements/arpages/intro/intro.htm|website=University of Michigan|accessdate=2 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origin of AR theory ==
The initial concept of an attainable region for chemical processes was proposed by Fritz Horn in 1964, where he believed in geometric methods to improve process design.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Feinberg|first=Martin|date=2002|title=Toward a theory of process synthesis|url=|journal=Industrial &amp; Engineering Chemistry Research|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These ideas were later refined and made specific to chemical reactors by co-developers David Glasser, Diane Hildebrandt,&lt;ref name="Amazon.com"&gt;{{cite book|title=Attainable Region Theory: An Introduction to Choosing an Optimal Reactor|isbn=978-1119157885|last1=Ming|first1=David|last2=Glasser|first2=David|last3=Metgzer|first3=Matthew|last4=Hildebrandt|first4=Diane|last5=Glasser|first5=Benjamin|date=2016-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Martin Feinberg.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Overview ==
The AR is defined as the collection all possible outcomes for all conceivable reactor combinations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Metzger|first=Matthew|last2=Glasser|first2=Benjamin|last3=Glasser|first3=David|last4=Hausberger|first4=Brendon|last5=Hildebrandt|first5=Diane|date=2007|title=Teaching Reaction Engineering Using the Attainable Region|url=http://coewww.rutgers.edu/bglasser/ResearchGroup/Publications/CEE07.pdf|journal=Chemical Engineering Education|page=258|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Geometrically, the AR may (for instance) be represented as a convex region in state space representing all possible outlet compositions for all reactor combinations. A combination of reactors is often termed a reactor structure. An example of the reactors that are considered for this theory are [[Continuous stirred-tank reactor|Continuous flow stirred-tank reactor (CSTR)]] and a [[Plug flow reactor model|Plug flow reactor model (PFR)]].

Knowledge of the AR helps to address two areas in chemical reactor design:
# The reactor network synthesis problem: Given a system of reactions and feed point, construction of the AR assists with determining an optimal reactor structure that achieves a desired duty or objective function. That is, AR theory assists with understanding specifically what type and combination of the chemical reactors are best suited for a particular system and duty. 
# Performance targeting: Given an existing reactor design, knowledge of the AR assists with understanding if there are other reactor structures that could achieve superior performance, by comparison to its location in the AR. Seeing as the AR represents all reactor designs by definition, different proposed reactor designs must lie as a point in or on the AR in state space. The effectiveness of each design may then all be assessed by comparison the AR and their relation to objective functions if any.

== Applications of theory ==
Examples of where AR theory can be applied, include:
* The design of [[batch reactor]] networks;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ming|first=David et al.|date=2013|title=Application of attainable region theory to batch reactors|url=|journal=Chemical Engineering Science|doi=10.1016/j.ces.2013.06.001|pmid=|access-date=|volume=99|pages=203–214}}&lt;/ref&gt; and

The '''balking pattern''' is a [[design pattern (computer science)|software design pattern]] that only executes an action on an [[object (computer science)|object]] when the object is in a particular state. For example, if an object reads [[ZIP file format|ZIP]] files and a calling method invokes a get method on the object when the ZIP file is not open, the object would "balk" at the request.  In the [[Java (programming language)|Java]] programming language, for example, an IllegalStateException might be thrown under these circumstances.

There are some specialists{{who|date=November 2010}} in this field who consider balking more of an [[anti-pattern]] than a design pattern.  If an object cannot support its [[API]], it should either limit the API so that the offending call is not available, or so that the call can be made without limitation it should:
* Be created in a "sane state"{{elucidate|date=April 2015}}
* Not make itself available until it is in a sane state
* Become a [[Facade pattern|facade]] and answer back an object that is in a sane state

==Usage==
Objects that use this pattern are generally only in a state that is prone to balking temporarily but for an unknown amount of time.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}  If objects are to remain in a state which is prone to balking for a known, finite period of time, then the [[guarded suspension pattern]] may be preferred.

==Implementation==
Below is a general, simple example for an implementation of the balking pattern.&lt;ref name=Grand&gt;{{cite book| last = Grand | first = Mark| title = Patterns in Java, Volume 1: A Catalog of Reusable Design Patterns Illustrated with UML, Second Edition| year = 2002| publisher = John Wiley &amp; Sons| location = Indianapolis, Ind}}&lt;/ref&gt; As demonstrated by the definition above, notice how the "synchronized" line is utilized. If there are multiple calls to the job method, only one will proceed while the other calls will return with nothing. Another thing to note is the &lt;code&gt;jobCompleted()&lt;/code&gt; method. The reason it is synchronized is because the only way to guarantee another thread will see a change to a field is to synchronize all access to it or declare it as volatile.

&lt;source lang="java"&gt;
public class Example {
    private boolean jobInProgress = false;

    public void job() {
        synchronized(this) {
           if (jobInProgress) {
               return;
           }
           jobInProgress = true;
        }
        // Code to execute job goes here
        // ...
    }

    void jobCompleted() {
        synchronized(this) {
            jobInProgress = false;
        }
    }
}
&lt;/source&gt;

'''Bibliometrics''' is [[statistical]] analysis of written publications, such as books or articles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bibliometrics|url=http://stats.oecd.org/glossary/detail.asp?ID=198|website=OECD Glossary of Statistical Terms|publisher=[[OECD]]|accessdate=5 January 2015|date=28 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Bibliometric methods are frequently used in the field of [[library and information science]], including [[scientometrics]]. For instance, bibliometrics are used to provide [[Quantitative research|quantitative]] analysis of [[Academic publishing|academic literature]]&lt;ref name=bellis&gt;{{cite book|last=De Bellis|first=Nicola|title=Bibliometrics and citation analysis: from the Science citation index to cybermetrics|year=2009|publisher=Scarecrow Press|isbn=0-8108-6713-3|pages=417|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ma4YjaKyM9cC}}&lt;/ref&gt; or for evaluating budgetary spending.&lt;ref&gt;D Coughlin, M Campbell, BJ Jansen (2016) [https://faculty.ist.psu.edu/jjansen/academic/jansen_library_web_analytics.pdf A Web Analytics Approach for Appraising Electronic Resources in Academic Libraries].

[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5862826/ doi: 10.3389/fphar.2018.00215].&lt;/ref&gt; Bibliometrics also has a wide range of other applications, such as in [[descriptive linguistics]], the development of [[thesauri]], and evaluation of reader usage.

Historically, bibliometric methods have been used to trace relationships amongst academic journal citations. Citation analysis, which involves examining an item's referring documents, is used in searching for materials and analyzing their merit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schaer|first=Philipp|title=Applied Informetrics for Digital Libraries: An Overview of Foundations, Problems and Current Approaches|journal=Historical Social Research|year=2013|volume=38|issue=3|pages=267–281}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Citation index|Citation indices]], such as [[Institute for Scientific Information]]'s [[Web of Science]], allow users to search forward in time from a known article to more recent publications which cite the known item.

Data from citation indexes can be analyzed to determine the popularity and impact of specific articles, authors, and publications. Using citation analysis to gauge the importance of one's work, for example, is a significant part of the [[tenure]] review process.&lt;ref&gt;Steve Kolowich. ''Tenure-o-meter'' in [http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2009/12/15/tenure Inside Higher Ed, December 15, 2009]. This article refers to the bibliometrics tool now known as [http://scholarometer.indiana.edu/ Scholarometer]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Hoang |first=D. |author2=Kaur, J. |author3=[[Filippo Menczer|Menczer, F.]] |year=2010 |title=Crowdsourcing Scholarly Data |journal=Proceedings of the WebSci10: Extending the Frontiers of Society On-Line, April 26-27th, 2010, Raleigh, NC: US |url=http://journal.webscience.org/321/ |access-date=2010-05-25 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150417002430/http://journal.webscience.org/321/ |archive-date=2015-04-17 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Information scientists also use citation analysis to quantitatively assess the core journal titles and watershed publications in particular disciplines; interrelationships between authors from different institutions and schools of thought; and related data about the sociology of academia. Some more pragmatic applications of this information includes the planning of retrospective bibliographies, "giving some indication both of the age of material used in a discipline, and of the extent to which more recent publications supersede the older ones"; indicating through high frequency of citation which documents should be archived; comparing the coverage of secondary services which can help publishers gauge their achievements and competition, and can aid librarians in evaluating "the effectiveness of their stock".&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas, David and Maureen Ritchie. ''Literature and Bibliometrics'' London: Clive Bingley: 1978. (12-28).&lt;/ref&gt; There are also some limitations to the value of citation data.  They are often incomplete or biased; data has been largely collected by hand (which is expensive), though citation indexes can also be used; incorrect citing of sources occurs continually; thus, further investigation is required to truly understand the rationale behind citing to allow it to be confidently applied.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas, David and Maureen Ritchie. ''Literature and Bibliometrics'' London: Clive Bingley: 1978. (28-29).&lt;/ref&gt;

Bibliometrics are now used in quantitative research assessment exercises of academic output which is starting to threaten practice based research.&lt;ref&gt;Henderson, M., Shurville, S. and Fernstrom, K. (2009). [http://www.emeraldinsight.com/10.1108/10650740910967348 ''The quantitative crunch: the impact of bibliometric research quality assessment exercises on academic development at small conferences''], Campus-Wide Information Systems, Vol 26, No. 3, pp. 149–167&lt;/ref&gt; The UK government has considered using bibliometrics as a possible auxiliary tool in its [[Research Excellence Framework]], a process which will assess the quality of the research output of UK universities and on the basis of the assessment results, allocate research funding.&lt;ref&gt;Higher Education Funding Council for England, http://www.hefce.ac.uk/Research/ref/. Accessed 20 July 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; This has met with significant scepticism and, after a pilot study, looks unlikely to replace the current peer review process.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hefce.ac.uk/news/newsarchive/2015/Name,104464,en.html|title=Metrics cannot replace peer review in the next REF|last=England|first=Higher Education Funding Council for|website=www.hefce.ac.uk|language=en|access-date=2016-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other bibliometrics applications include: creating thesauri; measuring term frequencies; as metrics in [[scientometrics|scientometric]] analysis, exploring [[grammar|grammatical]] and [[syntax|syntactical]] structures of texts; measuring usage by readers; quantifying value of online media of communication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/asi.22936 |arxiv=1303.0766 |title=Bibliometrics for Internet media: Applying the h-index to YouTube |year=2013 |last1=Hovden |first1=R. |journal=Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology |volume= 64|issue= 11|pages=2326–2331 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The term ''bibliométrie'' was first used by Paul Otlet in 1934&lt;ref name=Otlet&gt;{{cite | author=Otlet, P. | title=Traité De Documentation: Le Livre Sur Le Livre, Théorie Et Pratique | publisher=Editiones Mundaneum: Mons, Belgium | year=1934}}&lt;/ref&gt; and defined as "the measurement of all aspects related to the publication and reading of books and documents."&lt;ref name=Rousseau&gt;{{cite | author=Rousseau, Ronald | title=Library Science: Forgotten Founder of Bibliometrics. | journal=Nature | year=2014 | volume=510 | pages=218}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Anglicisation|anglicised]] version ''bibliometrics'' was first used by Alan Pritchard in a paper published in 1969, titled ''Statistical Bibliography or Bibliometrics?''&lt;ref name=Pritchard&gt;Pritchard, Alan, 'Statistical Bibliography or Bibliometrics?', Journal of Documentation, 25(4) Dec 1969, 348-349. https://www.academia.edu/598618/Statistical_bibliography_or_bibliometrics Accessed 6 January 2015&lt;/ref&gt; He defined the term as "the application of mathematics and statistical methods to books and other media of communication".

Citation analysis has a long history, the [[Science Citation Index]] began publication in 1961 and [[Derek J. de Solla Price]] discussed the citation graph describing the network of citations in his 1965 article "Networks of Scientific Papers".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Derek J. de Solla Price | title=Networks of Scientific Papers | journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] | date=July 30, 1965 | volume=149 | issue=3683| pages=510&amp;ndash;515 | url=http://garfield.library.upenn.edu/papers/pricenetworks1965.pdf | pmid=14325149 | doi=10.1126/science.149.3683.510|format=PDF| bibcode=1965Sci...149..510D}}&lt;/ref&gt; However this was done initially manually until large scale electronic databases and associated computer algorithms were able to cope with the vast numbers of documents in most bibliometric collections. The first such algorithm for automated citation extraction and indexing was by [[CiteSeer]]. Google's [[PageRank]] is based on the principle of  citation analysis. [[Patent]] citation maps are also based upon citation analysis (in this case, the citation of one patent by another).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5325">'''BioPAX''' (Biological Pathway Exchange) is a [[Resource Description Framework|RDF]]/[[Web Ontology Language|OWL]]-based
standard language to represent [[biological pathway]]s
at the molecular and cellular level. Its major use is to facilitate the exchange of pathway data.
Pathway data captures our understanding of biological processes, but
its rapid growth necessitates development of databases and computational tools to aid
interpretation. However, the current fragmentation of pathway information across many
databases with incompatible formats presents barriers to its effective use. BioPAX solves this
problem by making pathway data substantially easier to collect, index, interpret and share.
BioPAX can represent metabolic and signaling pathways, molecular and genetic interactions and
gene regulation networks. BioPAX was created through a community process. Through BioPAX,
millions of interactions organized into thousands of pathways across many organisms, from a
growing number of sources, are available. Thus, large amounts of pathway data are available in a
computable form to support visualization, analysis and biological discovery.

It is supported by a variety of online databases (e.g. [[Reactome]]) and tools. The latest released version is BioPAX Level 3. There is also an effort to create a version of BioPAX as part of [[Open Biomedical Ontologies|OBO]].

==Governance and development==

The next version of BioPAX, Level 4, is being developed by a community of researchers. Development is coordinated by board of editors and facilitated by various BioPAX work groups.

[[SBPAX|Systems Biology Pathway Exchange (SBPAX)]] is an extension for Level 3 and proposal for Level 4 to add quantitative data and [[systems biology]] terms (such as [[Systems Biology Ontology]]). SBPAX export has been implemented by the [[biological pathway|pathway]] databases [[Signaling Gateway (website)#Molecule Pages Database|Signaling Gateway Molecule Pages]]&lt;ref name="pmid21505029"&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[SABIO-Reaction Kinetics Database]]. SBPAX import has been implemented by the cellular modeling framework [[Virtual Cell]].

Other proposals for Level 4 include improved support for [[Semantic Web]], validation and visualization.

'''Biotremology''' is the study of production, dispersion and reception of mechanical [[vibration]]s by [[organism]]s, and their effect on [[behavior]]. This involves [[neurophysiology|neurophysiological]] and [[anatomy|anatomical]] basis of vibration production and detection, and relation of vibrations to the medium they disperse through. Vibrations can represent either [[signal]]s used in [[Seismic communication|vibrational (seismic) communication]] or inadvertent [[Sensory cue|cues]] used, for example, in locating prey (in some cases even both). In almost all known cases, they are transmitted as [[surface wave]]s along the [[Interface (matter)|boundary]] of a medium, i.e. [[Rayleigh wave]]s or bending waves.&lt;ref name="Primer"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hill |first1=Peggy S.M. |last2=Wessel |first2=Andreas |year=2016 |title=Biotremology |journal=[[Current Biology]] |volume=26 |issue=5 |pages=R187–R191 |doi=10.1016/j.cub.2016.01.054}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Virant-Doberlet |first1=Meta |last2=Čokl |first2=Andrej |last3=Zorović |first3=Maja |year=2006 |chapter=Use of Substrate Vibrations for Orientation: From Behaviour to Physiology |editor-last1=Drosopoulos |editor-first1=Sakis |editor-last2=Claridge |editor-first2=Michael F. |title=Insect Sounds and Communication |location=Boca Raton |publisher=CRC Press |isbn=978-0-8493-2060-6 |doi=10.1201/9781420039337.ch5 |pages=81–98}}&lt;/ref&gt; While most attention is directed towards the role of vibrations in [[animal behavior]], [[plant]]s actively respond to sounds and vibrations as well, so this subject is shared with [[plant bioacoustics]].&lt;ref name="GaglianoMancuso2012"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gagliano |first1=Monica |last2=Mancuso |first2=Stefano |last3=Robert |first3=Daniel |title=Towards understanding plant bioacoustics |journal=Trends in Plant Science |volume=17 |issue=6 |year=2012 |pages=323–325 |doi=10.1016/j.tplants.2012.03.002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other groups of organisms (such as [[nematode]]s&lt;ref name="HolbrookMortimer2018"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Holbrook |first1=Robert I. |last2=Mortimer |first2=Beth |title=Vibration sensitivity found in ''Caenorhabditis elegans'' |journal=The Journal of Experimental Biology |volume=221 |issue=15 |year=2018 |pages=jeb178947 |doi=10.1242/jeb.178947}}&lt;/ref&gt;) are also postulated to either actively produce or at least use vibrations to sense their environment, but those are currently far less studied.

Traditionally regarded part of [[bioacoustics]], the discipline has recently begun to actively diverge on its own, because of the many peculiarities of the studied [[Stimulus modality|modality]] compared with [[sound]].&lt;ref name="Primer"/&gt; Vibrational communication has been recognized as evolutionarily older than sound and much more prevalent, at least among [[arthropod]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last1=Cocroft |first1=Reginald B. |last2=Rodríguez |first2=Rafael L. |title=The behavioral ecology of insect vibrational communication |journal=[[BioScience]] |year=2005 |issue=55 |pages=323–334 |doi=10.1641/0006-3568(2005)055[0323:TBEOIV]2.0.CO;2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hill |first=Peggy S.M. |year=2008 |title=Vibrational Communication in Animals |publisher=Harvard University Press |isbn=9780674027985}}&lt;/ref&gt; although the two modalities are closely related and sometimes overlap.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Caldwell |first=Michael S.  |year=2014 |chapter=Interactions Between Airborne Sound and Substrate Vibration in Animal Communication |editor1=Cocroft, Reginald B. |editor2=Gogala, Matija |editor3=Hill, Peggy S.M. |editor4=Wessel, Andreas |title=Studying vibrational communication |publisher=[[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]] |pages=65–92 |doi=10.1007/978-3-662-43607-3_6}}&lt;/ref&gt; While many experimental approaches are shared between the two disciplines, scientists in the field of biotremology often use special equipment, such as [[laser vibrometer]]s, for detecting faint vibrational emissions by animals and electromagnetic transducers in contact with the substrate for artificial playback experiments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Michelsen |first=Axel |year=2014 |chapter=Physical Aspects of Vibrational Communication |editor1=Cocroft, Reginald B. |editor2=Gogala, Matija |editor3=Hill, Peggy S.M. |editor4=Wessel, Andreas |title=Studying vibrational communication |publisher=[[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]] |pages=199–213 |doi=10.1007/978-3-662-43607-3_11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[File:Scaphoideus titanus mating.jpg|thumb|left|[[Leafhoppers]] are a group of insects known for using only vibrational signals during courtship. They also comprise numerous pests (the [[Scaphoideus titanus|American grapevine leafhopper]] pictured), so biotremologists are developing alternative methods of pest control on this basis.&lt;ref name="PolajnarEtal15"/&gt;]]
People have observed vibrational communication by animals for hundreds of years, although the idea that vibrations may convey information dates to the middle of the 20th century. Swedish entomologist [[Frej Ossiannilsson]] pioneered the field in 1949 by suggesting vibrations transmitted through plants play a role in insect communication. His work demonstrating this suggestion was not heeded by contemporaries because many zoologists believed that such small animals are physically incapable of conveying information through solid substrates. Only with the advent of accessible [[signal processing]] technology decades later did the work by other pioneering individuals and groups, such as the Slovenian zoologist [[Matija Gogala]], establish the basis of biotremology. It remains a relatively understudied discipline, at least compared to bioacoustics, partly because most of animal-produced signals are undetectable to non-augmented human senses.&lt;ref name="Primer"/&gt;

Nevertheless, several instances of practical utilization of the knowledge obtained are already in use or are being actively developed, such as [[mating disruption]] using vibrational noise for non-chemical [[pest control]] and detection of concealed arthropod pests (such as wood-boring insects).&lt;ref name="PolajnarEtal15"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Polajnar |first1=Jernej |last2=Eriksson |first2=Anna |last3=Lucchi |first3=Andrea |last4=Anfora |first4=Gianfranco |last5=Virant-Doberlet |first5=Meta |last6=Mazzoni |first6=Valerio |year=2015 |title=Manipulating behaviour with substrate-borne vibrations – potential for insect pest control |journal=Pest Management Science |pages=15–23 |volume=17 |issue=1 |doi=10.1002/ps.3848|url=https://openpub.fmach.it/bitstream/10449/23771/4/2015%20PMS%20Polajnar%20et%20al.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last=Mankin |first=Richard W. |year=2012 |title=Applications of acoustics in insect pest management |journal=CAB Reviews |volume=7 |issue=1 |pages=1–7 |doi=10.1079/PAVSNNR20127001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The indentation should not extend unsupported on the interior in order to maintain the structural integrity of the rafter because the unsupported section can split along the grain of the wood. The joint is generally fastened with nails by [[toenailing]] the rafter from the side into the top plate below.

The depth of a rafter cut varies according to local building code differences in different locations. As a general rule, no more than one third of the depth of the rafter should be removed, in order to maintain structural integrity.

'''Cat communication''' is the transfer of information by one or more [[cat]]s that has an effect on the current or future behaviour of another animal, including humans.  Cats use a range of communication modalities including vocal, visual, tactile and olfactory.

The communication modalities used by domestic cats have been affected by [[domestication]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first1=D.C.|last1=Turner|first2=P.P.G|last2=Bateson|first3=P.|last3=Bateson|title=The Domestic Cat: The Biology Of Its Behaviour|publisher=Cambridge University Press|pages=68|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kO5y0fnLUD4C|isbn=9780521636483|date=2000-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{listen|filename=Meow.ogg|title=A cat meowing}}

Cat vocalisations have been categorised according to a range of characteristics.

Schötz categorised vocalizations according to three mouth actions:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |last=Schötz |first=Susanne |title=A phonetic pilot study of vocalizations in three cats |conference=Proceedings Fonetik 2012. The XXVth Swedish Phonetics conference |date=May 30 – June 1, 2012 |location=University of Gothenburg |pages=45–58 |url=http://person2.sol.lu.se/SusanneSchotz/Publications_files/Schoetz_2012%3DDomesticCatVocalisations.pdf |format=PDF }}&lt;/ref&gt;
# sounds produced with the mouth closed (murmurs), including the purr, the trill and the chirrup, 
# sounds produced with the mouth open and gradually closing, comprising a large variety of meows with similar vowel patterns, and 
# sounds produced with the mouth held tensely open in the same position, often uttered in aggressive situations (growls, yowls, snarls, hisses, spits and shrieks).

Brown et al. categorised vocal responses of cats according to the behavioural context: during separation of kittens from mother cats, during food deprivation, during pain, prior to or during threat or attack behavior, as in disputes over territory or food, during a painful or acutely stressful experience, as in routine prophylactic injections and during kitten deprivation.&lt;ref name="Brown"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Vocalization in the cat and kitten |author=Brown, K.A., Buchwald, J.S., Johnson, J.R. and Mikolich, D.J.|journal=Developmental Psychobiology|volume=11|issue=6|pages=559–570 |year=1978|doi= 10.1002/dev.420110605|pmid=720761}}&lt;/ref&gt; Less commonly recorded calls from mature cats included purring, [[Biological specificity|conspecific]] greeting calls or murmurs, extended vocal dialogues between cats in separate cages, “frustration” calls during training or extinction of conditioned responses.

Miller classified vocalisations into five categories according to the sound produced: the purr, chirr, call, meow and growl/snarl/hiss.&lt;ref name="Miller"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.associationofanimalbehaviorprofessionals.com/whisker_whispers.html |title=Whisker whispers |first=P. |last=Miller |publisher=Association of Animal Behavior Professionals |year=2000 |accessdate=November 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Owens et al. 2017 categorized cat vocalisations based on their acoustic structures. There are three categories: tonal sounds, pulse sounds, and broadband sounds. Tonal sounds are further categorized into groups of harmonically structured sounds or regular tonal sounds. Pulse vocalisations are separated into pulse bursts and hybrid pulse bursts with tonal endings. Broadband sounds are separated into four groups: non-tonal broadband sounds, broadband sounds with tonal beginnings, broadband sounds with short tonal elements, and broadband sounds with long tonal endings.&lt;ref&gt;Owens,J.L., Olsen, M., Fontaine, A., Kloth, C., Kershenbaum, A. and Waller, S., 2017. Visual classification of feral cat Felis silvestris catus vocalizations. ''Current Zoology'', ''63''(3), pp.331-339.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Purr===
{{Main|Purr}}
[[File:Relaxed black cat.JPG|thumbnail|right|Relaxed tomcat lying on his back.]]
The purr is a continuous, soft, vibrating sound made in the throat by most species of [[felidae|felines]]. Domestic kittens can purr as early as two days of age.&lt;ref name="Miller" /&gt;  This tonal rumbling can characterize different personalities in domestic cats. Purring is often believed to indicate a [[Emotion in animals#Cats|positive emotional state]], but cats sometimes purr when they are ill, tense, or experiencing traumatic or painful moments such as giving birth.&lt;ref name="Turner"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kO5y0fnLUD4C&amp;pg=PA72 |title=The Domestic Cat: The Biology Of Its Behaviour |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2000 |pages=71, 72, 86 and 88 |isbn=978-0521-63648-3 |accessdate=3 January 2012 |first1=D.C.|last1=Turner|first2=P.|last2=Bateson (eds.)}}&lt;/ref&gt; A more expansive definition is "purring signals a friendly social mood, and it can be given as a signal to, say, a vet from an injured cat indicating the need for friendship, or as a signal to an owner, saying thank you for friendship given."&lt;ref name="Morris"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=soZGAAAAYAAJ |title=Cat Watching |publisher=Crown Publishing Group |year=1987 |page=17 |isbn=978-0517880531 |accessdate=2 January 2016 |first1=Desmond|last1=Morris}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mechanism of how cats purr is elusive. This is partly because cats do not have a unique anatomical feature that is clearly responsible for this vocalization.&lt;ref name='CPEM'&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.loc.gov/rr/scitech/mysteries/catspurr.html |title=Why and how do cats purr? |accessdate=10 April 2011 |publisher=[[Library of Congress]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One hypothesis, supported by [[electromyographic]] studies, is that cats produce the purring noise by using the [[vocal folds]] and/or the muscles of the [[larynx]] to alternately dilate and constrict the [[glottis]] rapidly, causing air vibrations during inhalation and exhalation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=K.M. |last1=Dyce |first2=W.O. |last2=Sack |first3=C.J.G. |last3=Wensing |year=2002 |title=Textbook of Veterinary Anatomy, 3rd ed. |publisher=Saunders, Philadelphia |pages=156}}&lt;/ref&gt; Combined with the steady inhalation and exhalation as the cat breathes, a purring noise is produced with strong [[harmonics]]. Purring is sometimes accompanied by other sounds, though this varies between individuals.  Some may only purr, while other cats include low level outbursts sometimes described as "lurps" or "yowps".

Domestic cats purr at varying [[frequency|frequencies]]. One study reported that domestic cats purr at average frequencies of 21.98&amp;nbsp;Hz in the [[egressive]] phase and 23.24&amp;nbsp;Hz in the [[ingressive]] phase with an overall mean of 22.6&amp;nbsp;Hz.&lt;ref name="eklund"&gt;{{cite web |first1=R. |last1=Eklund |first2=G. |last2=Peters |first3=E.D. |last3=Duthie |title=An acoustic analysis of purring in the cheetah (''Acinonyx jubatus'') and in the domestic cat (''Felis catus'') |work= Proceedings from Fonetik 2011 |url=http://roberteklund.info/pdf/Eklund_Peters_Duthie_2010=Purring_Cheetah_DomesticCat.pdf |accessdate=November 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further research on purring in four domestic cats found that the [[fundamental frequency]] varied between 20.94 and 27.21&amp;nbsp;Hz for the egressive phase and between 23.0 and 26.09&amp;nbsp;Hz for the ingressive phase. There was considerable variation between the four cats in the relative amplitude, duration and frequency between egressive and ingressive phases, although this variation generally occurred within the normal range.&lt;ref name="eklund2"&gt;{{cite web |first1=S. |last1=Schötz|first2=R.|last2=Eklund|title=A comparative acoustic analysis of purring in four cats |work=Proceedings from Fonetik 2011 |url=http://roberteklund.info/pdf/Schotz_Eklund_2011_Purring_DomesticCats.pdf |accessdate=November 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One study on a single [[cheetah]] (''Acinonyx jubatus'') showed it purred with an average frequency of 20.87&amp;nbsp;Hz (egressive phases) and 18.32&amp;nbsp;Hz (ingressive phases).&lt;ref name="eklund" /&gt;  A further study on four adult cheetahs found that mean frequencies were between 19.3&amp;nbsp;Hz and 20.5&amp;nbsp;Hz in ingressive phases, and between 21.9&amp;nbsp;Hz and 23.4&amp;nbsp;Hz in egressive phases.  The egressive phases were longer than ingressive phases and moreover, the amplitude was greater in the egressive phases.&lt;ref name="eklund3"&gt;{{cite web |first1=R.|last1=Eklund |first2=G.|last2=Peters|first3=F. |last3=Weise |first4=S. |last4=Munro |title=A comparative acoustic analysis of purring in four cheetahs |work=Proceedings from Fonetik 2011 |url=http://roberteklund.info/pdf/Eklund_et_al_2012_Cheetah_Purring.pdf |accessdate=November 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was once believed that only the cats of the [[genus]] ''[[Felis]]'' could purr.&lt;ref&gt;Breton, R. Roger; Creek, Nancy J. [http://www.cougarhill.info/cats/overview.html "Overview of Felidae"]. Cougar Hill Web. Retrieved May 23, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; However, felids of the genus ''[[Panthera]]'' (tigers, lions, jaguars and leopards) also produce sounds similar to purring, but only when exhaling. The subdivision of the Felidae into ‘purring cats’ on the one hand and ‘roaring cats ’ (i.e. non-purring) on the other, originally goes back to Owen (1834/1835) and was definitely introduced by Pocock (1916), based on a difference in [[hyoid bone|hyoid]] anatomy. The ‘roaring cats’ (lion, ''Panthera leo''; tiger, ''P. tigris''; jaguar, ''P. onca''; leopard, ''P. pardus'') have an incompletely ossified hyoid, which according to this theory, enables them to roar but not to purr. On the other hand, the [[snow leopard]] (''Uncia uncia''), as the fifth felid species with an incompletely ossified hyoid, purrs (Hemmer, 1972). All remaining species of the family Felidae (‘purring cats’) have a completely ossified hyoid which enables them to purr but not to roar. However, Weissengruber et al. (2002) argued that the ability of a cat species to purr is not affected by the anatomy of its hyoid, i.e. whether it is fully ossified or has a ligamentous [[wikt:epihyoid|epihyoid]], and that, based on a technical acoustic definition of roaring, the presence of this vocalization type depends on specific characteristics of the vocal folds and an elongated vocal tract, the latter rendered possible by an incompletely ossified hyoid.

===Mew===
Mewing is a vocalization of domestic kittens, apparently used to solicit attention from the kitten's mother.&lt;ref name="Miller" /&gt; The mew is similar to what is described in Brown et al. 1978 as an isolation call. By around three to four weeks of age kittens do not mew when at least one littermate is present, and at four to five months of age kittens stop mewing altogether.&lt;ref name="Brown" /&gt;

===Meow===
{{main|Meow}}
[[File:Siam blue point.jpg|thumbnail|right|A cat meowing for attention]]
The most familiar vocalisation of adult cats is a "'''meow'''" or "'''miaow'''" sound (pronounced {{IPAc-en|m|i|ˈ|aʊ}}). The meow can be assertive, plaintive, friendly, bold, welcoming, attention-soliciting, demanding, or complaining.  It can even be silent, where the cat opens its mouth but does not vocalize. Adult cats rarely meow to each other, and so adult meowing to human beings is likely to be a post-domestication extension of mewing by kittens.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Bradshaw |first=John W. S. |date=2016-01 |title=Sociality in cats: A comparative review |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1558787815001549 |journal=Journal of Veterinary Behavior: Clinical Applications and Research |volume=11 |pages=113–124 |doi=10.1016/j.jveb.2015.09.004|issn=1558-7878}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chirr===
The chirr or chirrup sounds like a meow rolled on the tongue. It is commonly used by mother cats calling their kittens inside the nest. Kittens recognize their own mother's chirp, and do not respond to the chirps of other mothers.&lt;ref name="Szenczi"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Szenczi, P., Bánszegi, O., Urrutia, A., Faragó, T. and Hudson, R. |year=2016|title=Mother–offspring recognition in the domestic cat: Kittens recognize their own mother's call|journal=Developmental Psychobiology |volume=58|issue=5|pages=568–577|doi=10.1002/dev.21402|pmid=26935009}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also used by friendly cats when eliciting the approach of another cat or a human.  Humans can mimic the sound to reassure and greet pet cats.&lt;ref name="Miller" /&gt;

===Chirping and chattering===
[[File:Cat making noises at the birds outside.webm|thumb|A cat chattering at the birds]]
Cats sometimes make excited chirping or chattering noises when observing or stalking prey.&lt;ref name="Schötz"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Schötz, S. |year=2013 |title=A phonetic pilot study of chirp, chatter, tweet and tweedle in three domestic cats |journal=Fonetik |pages=65–68 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These range from quiet clicking sounds to loud but sustained chirping mixed with the occasional meow.

Some researchers believe this chattering may also be an involuntary, instinctual, imitation of the moment a killing bite on the neck occurs. This action activates a vibration of the feline's jaws to allow the precision to slide between a prey's spine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cathealth.com/how-and-why/why-cats-chatter-at-birds |title=Why Do Cats Chatter at Birds? |first=Aquanta |last=LLC |website=www.cathealth.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chirping is also used by mothers to comfort and get the attention of the kittens in their litters. The kittens learn to identify their mothers' chirps fairly early in life.&lt;ref name="Szenczi" /&gt; There was also mention of a call, that presumably was a chirp, in Brown et al. 1978 where a five-week-old kitten had wandered from the nest and when the mother chirped and the kitten immediately turned back in her direction.

===Call===
The call is a loud, rhythmic vocalisation made with the mouth closed.  It is primarily associated with female cats soliciting males, and sometimes occurs in males when fighting with each other.&lt;ref name="Miller" /&gt;  A "caterwaul" is the cry of a cat [[estrus|in estrus]] (or "in heat").&lt;ref name="ASPCA"&gt;{{cite web |title=Meowing and Yowling |url=http://www.aspca.org/Pet-care/virtual-pet-behaviorist/cat-articles/meowing-and-yowling |work=Virtual Pet Behaviorist |publisher=[[ASPCA]] |accessdate=28 May 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title=caterwaul |url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/caterwaul |work=Dictionary.com |publisher=Dictionary.com, LLC |accessdate=28 May 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Growl, snarl, hiss and spit===
The growl, snarl and hiss are all vocalisations associated with either offensive or defensive aggression. They are usually accompanied by a postural display intended to have a visual effect on the perceived threat. The communication may be directed at cats as well as other species – the puffed-up hissing and spitting display of a cat toward an approaching dog is a well-known behavior. Cats hiss when they are startled, scared, angry or in pain, and also to scare off intruders into their territory. If the hiss and growl warning does not remove the threat, an attack by the cat may follow. Kittens as young as two to three weeks will hiss and spit when first picked up by a human. "Spitting" is a shorter but louder and more emphatic version of hissing.&lt;ref name="Miller" /&gt;
[[file:Lion_raring-sound1TamilNadu178.ogg|right|thumb|Familiar lion's roar recorded from a big cat in captivity.]]

=== Howl, yowl, moan and wail ===
These sounds are commonly used during threatening situations. Howls are more tonal, moans are long and slowly modulated, anger wails are combined with growls, and yowls are similar to howls, only they are longer.&lt;ref&gt;Schötz, S., 2015, June. Agonistic vocalisations in domestic cats: a case study. In ''Proc Fonetik'' (Vol. 2015, pp. 85-90).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ultrasonic===
Very high frequency (“ultrasonic”) response components have been observed in kitten vocalizations.&lt;ref name="Brown" /&gt;

==Visual==
{{Refimprove section|date=February 2011}}
[[File:GAto.jpg|thumb|A cat hissing and arching its back to make itself appear larger to ward off a threat]]
Cats use postures and movement to communicate a wide range of information. There are various responses such as when cats arch their backs, erect their hairs and adopt a sideward posture to communicate fear or aggression.  Others may be only a single behavioural change (as perceived by humans) such as slowly blinking to signal relaxation.

Domestic cats frequently use visual communication with their eyes, ears, mouths, tails, coats and body postures.  It has been stated that a cat's facial features change the most and are probably the best indicator of cat communication.&lt;ref name="Miller" /&gt;

===Posture===
[[File:Surprised cat.jpg|thumb|right|150px|upright|Surprised cats have enlarged pupils and erect ears held slightly backwards.]]
When cats lie on their back with their belly exposed, they are in a position of vulnerability.  Therefore, this position may communicate a feeling of trust&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fraser|first1=Andrew|title=Feline Behaviour and Welfare|date=2012|publisher=C.A.B. International|location=Wallingford, Oxfordshire, UK|pages=58}}&lt;/ref&gt; or comfort; however, cats may also roll onto their back to defend themselves with their claws, or to bask in areas of bright sunlight.

When cats are calm, they tend to stand relaxed with a still tail.  If they become aggressive, the hind legs stiffen, the rump elevates but the back stays flat, tail hairs are erected, the nose is pushed forward and the ears are pulled back slightly.  Because cats have both claws and teeth, they can easily cause injury if they become involved in a fight, so this posture is an attempt to elicit deference by a competitor without fighting.  The aggressor may attempt to make challengers retreat and will pursue them if they do not flee.  A fearful, defensive cat makes itself smaller, lowers itself toward the ground, arches its back and leans its body away from the threat rather than forward.  Fighting usually occurs only when escape is impossible.&lt;ref name="Miller" /&gt;

In cats, flattened ears generally indicate that an individual feels threatened and may attack.  Having the mouth open and no teeth exposed indicates playfulness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Communicating with your cat|first=J. Anne|last= Helgren|publisher=Barron's Educational Series|year= 1999|isbn=978-0-7641-0855-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Abby playing in basket.jpg|thumb|right|150px|A [[tortoiseshell cat]] with erect hairs on its tail and back which in this context indicates excitement or curiosity]]

===Ears===
Cats can change the position of their ears very quickly, in a continuum from erect when the cat is alert and focused, slightly relaxed when the cat is calm, and flattened against the head when extremely defensive or aggressive.&lt;ref name="catwatch" /&gt;&lt;!-- does this really need a citation? Sorry no page # but it won't be hard to find with the book in front of you --&gt;

===Eyes===
A direct stare by a cat usually communicates a challenge or threat and is more likely to be seen in high-ranking cats; lower-ranking cats usually withdraw in response.&lt;ref name="Miller" /&gt; The direct stare is often used during predation or for territorial reasons.

In contrast to a direct stare, cats will lower their eyelids or slowly blink them to show trust and affection to their owners. According to Gary Weitzman, a licensed veterinarian and animal author, this type of feline body language is similar to a “kitty kiss”. He further explains in his book, "How To Speak Cat: A Guide to Decoding Cat Language,” slow blinking could be a physiological response to lowered stress hormonal levels from being in a calm state.

“The slow blink really is an acceptance gesture,” Weitzman said. “They do that when they’re absolutely comfortable with you, and they do it with other cats as well.” It's not clear why cats do this when they're feeling calm and comfortable, but Weitzman said, “it’s likely an autonomic response … having to do with the cat having its cortisol [stress hormone] levels down.”

In fact, Weitzman encourages cat owners to mimic this behavior to return not only a message of affection, but one that reinforces a nonthreatening position. This behavior is not exclusive to domestic house cats. Since cats can be very territorial, in the wild they utilize this slow blinking with other cats to signal themselves as friendly or nonthreatening.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=How to speak cat : a guide to decoding cat language|last=Alexander|first=Newman, Aline|others=Weitzman, Gary|isbn=9781426318634|location=Washington, D.C.|oclc=880756959|year = 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tail===
Cats often use their tails to communicate. A cat holding its tail vertically generally indicates positive emotions such as happiness or confidence; the vertical tail is often used as a friendly greeting toward human beings or other cats (usually close relatives).  A half-raised tail can indicate less pleasure, and unhappiness is indicated with a tail held low. In addition, a cat's tail may swing from side to side.  If this motion is slow and "lazy", it generally indicates that the cat is in a relaxed state.  Cats will twitch the tip of their tail when hunting or when otherwise alert or playful. Abrupt, full-tail twitching indicates a state of indecision.&lt;!-- This isn't relevant to the scope of this article, but the example Morris uses is a cat who steps outside and discovers it's raining. He will stand there, tail switching, as his desire to prowl wars it out with his desire to stay warm and dry. --&gt;&lt;ref name="catwatch"&gt;{{cite book |last=Morris |first=Desmond |date=1986 |title=Catwatching |publisher=Three Rivers Press |isbn=978-0517880531 |author-link=Desmond_Morris }}&lt;/ref&gt; A stalking domestic cat will typically hold its tail low to the ground while in a crouch, and twitch it quickly from side to side.  This tail behavior is also seen when a cat has become "irritated" and is nearing the point of lashing out, typically by biting or swatting with claws extended.  A cat may also twitch its tail when playing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iams.com/iams/pet-health/cat-body-language.jsp|title=Cat articles on Iams website|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometimes during play, a cat, or more commonly, a kitten, will raise the base of their tail high and stiffen all but the tip into a shape like an upside-down "U". This signals great excitement, to the point of hyperactivity. This may also be seen when younger cats chase each other, or when they run around by themselves. When greeting their owner, cats often hold their tails straight up with a quivering motion that indicates extreme happiness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Common Cat Behaviors|url=http://www.best-cat-tips.com/common_cat_behaviors.htm|work=Best Cat Tips|publisher=www.best-cat-tips.com|accessdate=28 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A scared or surprised cat may erect the hairs on its tail and back.  In addition, it may stand more upright and turn its body sideways to increase its apparent size as a threat. Tailless cats, such as the [[Manx (cat)|Manx]], which possess only a small stub of a tail, move the stub around as if they possess a full tail.

==Tactile==
Cats often lick other cats as [[allogrooming]] or to bond (this grooming is usually done between familiar cats). They also sometimes lick humans which may indicate affection.

[[File:2003-08-10 feather 04.JPG|thumb|A mackerel tabby cat kneading a blanket. The [[whisker]]s are positioned forward, indicating happiness or curiosity in this context.]]
Cats sometimes repeatedly tread their front paws on humans or soft objects with a [[Kneading (cats)|kneading action]].  This is instinctive to cats and in adults, is presumably derived from the action used to stimulate milk let-down by the mother during nursing.  Cats often purr during this behaviour, usually taken to indicate contentment and affection.

Cats have scent glands on the underside of their paws.  When they knead or scratch objects or people, it is likely these [[pheromones]] are transferred to the person or object being kneaded or scratched.

Touching noses, sometimes known as "sniffing noses", is a friendly, tactile greeting for cats.

Some cats rub their faces on humans, apparently as a friendly greeting or indicating affection. This tactile action is combined with olfactory communication as the contact leaves scent from glands located around the mouth and cheeks. Cats also sometimes "head-bump" humans or other cats with the front part of the head; this action is referred to as "[[bunting (animal behavior)|bunting]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Pam Johnson-Bennett|title=Bunting Behavior|url=http://www.catbehaviorassociates.com/bunting-behavior/|accessdate=30 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Again this communication might have an olfactory component as there are scent glands in this area of the body, and is possibly for seeking attention when the cat turns their head down or to the side while doing so.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cat Behavior Tips|url=http://cat.lifetips.com//cat/55839/cat-behavior/index.html|work=LifeTips|publisher=LifeTips|accessdate=28 May 2012|author=Mary White}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Head-bumping and cheek rubbing may be displays of social dominance as they are often exhibited by a dominant cat towards a subordinate.&lt;ref name="Miller" /&gt;

===Biting===
Gentle biting (often accompanied by purring and kneading) can communicate affection or playfulness, directed at the human owner or another cat; however, stronger bites that are often accompanied by hissing or growling usually communicate aggression.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.catsinternational.org/articles/all_about_kittens/kitten_play_therapy_pt2.html "Play Therapy Pt. 2," Cats International] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070419124014/http://catsinternational.org/articles/all_about_kittens/kitten_play_therapy_pt2.html |date=2007-04-19 }} retrieved May 22, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; When cats mate, the tom bites the scruff of the female's neck as she assumes a [[lordosis behavior|lordosis]] position which communicates that she is receptive to mating.

==Olfactory{{anchor|Scent}}==
Cats communicate [[Olfaction|olfactarily]] through scent in [[urine]], [[feces]], and chemicals or [[Cat pheromone|pheromones]] from glands located around the mouth, chin, forehead, cheeks, lower back, tail and paws.&lt;ref name="vetwest"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vetwest.com.au/pet-library/communication-how-do-cats-communicate|title=Communication - how do cats communicate?|publisher=vetwest animal hospitals|accessdate=November 5, 2013|date=2008-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Their rubbing and head-bumping behaviors are methods of depositing these scents on substrates, including humans.

[[Urine spraying]] is also a [[territorial marking]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Domestic Cat|year=2000|publisher=University Press, Cambridge|isbn=978-0521636483|pages=69–70|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kO5y0fnLUD4C|editor1=Dennis C. Turner|editor2=Patrick Bateman|edition=2nd |accessdate=28 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Although cats may mark with both sprayed and non-sprayed urine, the spray is usually more thick and oily than normally deposited urine, and may contain additional secretions from anal sacs that help the sprayer to make a stronger communication.  While cats mark their territory both by rubbing of the scent glands and by urine and fecal deposits, spraying, most frequently engaged in by unneutered male cats in competition with others of their same sex and species, seems to be the loudest feline olfactory statement. Female cats also sometimes spray.&lt;ref name="Miller" /&gt;

The urine of mature male cats in particular contains the [[amino acid]] known as [[felinine]] which is a precursor to [[3-mercapto-3-methylbutan-1-ol]] (MMB), the sulfur-containing compound that gives cat urine its characteristically strong odor. Felinine is produced in the urine from 3-methylbutanol-cysteinylglycine (3-MBCG) by the excreted [[peptidase]] [[cauxin]]. It then slowly degrades via bacterial [[lyase]] into the more-volatile chemical MMB.&lt;ref name='felinine'&gt;{{cite journal

The '''College for Advanced Studies in Social Theory''' ({{lang-hu|Társadalomelméleti Kollégium}}, ''TEK'') is the second oldest college of its type at the [[Corvinus University of Budapest]] as well as in [[Hungary]].

== History ==

TEK is the second oldest, still operating, college in Hungary. It was founded in 1981 by young researchers and students. Its orientation can be divided into two parts: vocational work and community life. The first is well documented, the latter is somewhat more distorted, due to the effects of [[collective memory]].
[[Image:Marx old.jpg|thumb|right|[[Karl Marx]]]]

=== 1981–present ===

TEK seceded from the first established college in Hungary, the [[Rajk László College for Advanced Studies]].
However, in the beginning - before [[revolutions of 1989|the fall of the Iron Curtain]] - the College's main topic was the reinterpretation of [[Marx]]'s ouvre, since liberal and alternative thinking was only possible if it was related to Marxist studies. With the fall of the iron curtain, this coercion disappeared, and since the College's main profile was its diversity and openness to new ideas, philosophies and theories, the College's profile now freely and rapidly ramified into diverse - and pioneering among the Hungarian colleges at that time - topics: [[environmentalism]], [[sustainability]], [[postmodernism]], [[anarchism]], [[postmarxism]], [[sociolinguistics]], [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]], [[post-structuralism]], [[Buddhist economics]], [[feminism]], [[minority group|sociology of minorities]], [[queer studies]], [[postcolonialism]], [[network theory]]. The College also dealt with the topic of [[squatting]], the sociological causes of [[poverty]] and since the establishment the farmost detailed analysis of [[critical theory]]/[[Frankfurt school]] among other colleges.

== Philosophical principles ==
=== Criticism ===

TEK is providing a critical approach to the economical theories that Corvinus University has in its educational program– among others, focusing on the social inequalities [[human resources]], [[structuralism]], [[neoliberalism]], [[functionalism (sociology)|functionalism]], [[corporatism]] inherently bares -.
TEK is also involved in highly regarded green activism, such as [[critical mass]], [[gay pride]], many [[flashmob]]s, that are held in support of promoting a livable environment. Among the members of TEK are also permanent supporters of the anti-[[g8]] anti-[[g20]] demonstrations.

=== Commune ===
The TEK started a lifestyle experiment, by establishing - again firstly - the habit of an annual [[commune (intentional community)|commune]],  in which the members apply voluntarily. These communes give the participants the opportunity to experience such a lifestyle that is hard to experience among European [[capitalist]] societies. In these communities the members share all goods, live together in one place creating a highly tied community of a few.

=== Aims ===

TEK’s main aim is a critical approach to the topics taught in Corvinus University.
TEK is more of a theoretical college, putting theoretical approaches to the questions of the society in front of bare statistical analysis, processing of data.
However members of TEK – individually - are highly involved in diverse fields of practice – e.g. organizing conferences on behalf of the homeless, many voluntary work promoting the reintegration of gypsies into the labour market, helping the educational development of those from less developed areas -.

== Vocational work ==
=== Tutorials ===

The base of the vocational work in TEK are the annual or semi-annual Tutorials. The topics of these Tutorials are given by the members of the College, which Tutorials are to be held by the tutors after compiling a schedule. The participants analyse, discuss the literature together with the tutor. As a conclusion, at the end of every tutorial, the participants are to hand in an essay of one of the topics that were discussed during the Tutorial.
The main frame for the Tutorials are based on 5 main fields: [[political economy]], economics of [[globalization]], Frankfurt School, [[green economics|green]] and [[Justice (economics)|ethical]] economics, postmodern sociology.
Every fresher has to participate in the Ground Tutorial, which provides a brief insight to the work and schedule of all five fields.

=== Related works ===

[http://fordulat.net Fordulat] (meaning “facing” or “twist”) is the official periodical of the College, dealing with many critical and however yet not mainstream, but pioneering topics.

=== Conferences ===

Among many others, [[Claus Offe]], one of the leading political sociologists and of the second generation Frankfurt School attended one of the conferences held by the College.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7790">'''Cue validity''' is the [[conditional probability]] that an object falls in a particular category given a particular feature or ''cue''. The term was popularized by {{Harvtxt|Beach|1964}}, {{Harvtxt|Reed|1972}} and especially by [[Eleanor Rosch]] in her investigations of the acquisition of so-called [[Prototype_theory#Basic_level_categories | ''basic categories'']] ({{Harvnb|Rosch|Mervis|1975}};{{Harvnb|Rosch|1978}}). 

==Definition of cue validity==
Formally, the cue validity of a feature &lt;math&gt;f_i\ &lt;/math&gt; with respect to category &lt;math&gt;c_j\ &lt;/math&gt; has been defined in the following ways:
* As the conditional probability &lt;math&gt;p(c_j|f_i)\ &lt;/math&gt;; see {{Harvtxt|Reed|1972}}, {{Harvtxt|Rosch|Mervis|1975}}, {{Harvtxt|Rosch|1978}}.
* As the deviation of the conditional probability from the category base rate, &lt;math&gt;p(c_j|f_i)-p(c_j)\ &lt;/math&gt;; see {{Harvtxt|Edgell|1993}}, {{Harvtxt|Kruschke|Johansen|1999}}.
* As a function of the linear correlation; see {{Harvtxt|Smedslund|1955}}, {{Harvtxt|Castellan|1973}}, {{Harvtxt|Sawyer|1991}}, {{Harvtxt|Busemeyer|Myung|McDaniel|1993}}.
* Other definitions; see {{Harvtxt|Restle|1957}}, {{Harvtxt|Martignon|Vitouch|Takezawa|Forster|2003}}.

For the definitions based on probability, a high cue validity for a given feature means that the feature or attribute is more diagnostic of the class membership than a feature with low cue validity. Thus, a high-cue validity feature is one which conveys more information about the category or class variable, and may thus be considered as more useful for identifying objects as belonging to that category. Thus, high cue validity expresses high feature ''informativeness''. For the definitions based on linear correlation, the expression of "informativeness" captured by the cue validity measure is not the full expression of the feature's informativeness (as in [[mutual information]], for example), but only that portion of its informativeness that is expressed in a linear relationship. For some purposes, a bilateral measure such as the [[mutual information]] or [[category utility]] is more appropriate than the cue validity.

==Examples==
As an example, let us consider the domain of "numbers" and allow that every number has an attribute (i.e., a ''cue'') named "&lt;code&gt;is_positive_integer&lt;/code&gt;", which we call &lt;math&gt;f_{p\mbox{-}int}\ &lt;/math&gt;, and which adopts the value 1 if the number is actually a positive [[integer]]. Then we can inquire what the validity of this cue is with regard to the following classes: {&lt;code&gt;rational number&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;irrational number&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;even integer&lt;/code&gt;}:
* If we know that a number is a positive integer we know that it is a [[rational number]]. Thus, &lt;math&gt;p(c_{rational}|f_{p\mbox{-}int}) = 1\ &lt;/math&gt;, the cue validity for &lt;code&gt;is_positive_integer&lt;/code&gt; as a cue for the category &lt;code&gt;rational number&lt;/code&gt; is 1.
* If we know that a number is a positive integer then we know that it is ''not'' an [[irrational number]]. Thus, &lt;math&gt;p(c_{irrational}|f_{p\mbox{-}int}) = 0\ &lt;/math&gt;, the cue validity for &lt;code&gt;is_positive_integer&lt;/code&gt; as a cue for the category &lt;code&gt;irrational number&lt;/code&gt; is 0.
* If we know only that a number is a positive integer, then its chances of being even or odd are 50-50 (there being the same number of even and odd integers). Thus, &lt;math&gt;p(c_{even}|f_{p\mbox{-}int}) = 0.5\ &lt;/math&gt;, the cue validity for &lt;code&gt;is_positive_integer&lt;/code&gt; as a cue for the category &lt;code&gt;even integer&lt;/code&gt; is 0.5, meaning that the attribute &lt;code&gt;is_positive_integer&lt;/code&gt; is entirely uninformative about the number's membership in the class &lt;code&gt;even integer&lt;/code&gt;.

In [[perception]], "cue validity" is often short for ''[[ecological validity (perception)|ecological validity]]'' of a perceptual cue, and is defined as a correlation rather than a probability (see above). In this definition, an uninformative perceptual cue has an ecological validity of 0 rather than 0.5.

==Use of the cue validity==
In much of the work on modeling human category learning, there has been the assumption made (and sometimes validated) that attentional weighting tracks the cue validity, or tracks some related measure of feature informativeness. This would imply that attributes are differently weighted by the perceptual system; informative or high-cue validity attributes being weighted more heavily, while uninformative or low-cue validity attributes are weighted more lightly or ignored altogether (see, e.g., Navarro 1998).

The FAA approved [[AC 20-115|AC 20-115C]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.faa.gov/documentLibrary/media/Advisory_Circular/AC_20-115C.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-08-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140903075843/http://www.faa.gov/documentLibrary/media/Advisory_Circular/AC_20-115C.pdf |archivedate=3 September 2014 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;  on 19 Jul 2013, making DO-178C a recognized "acceptable means, but not the only means, for showing compliance with the applicable airworthiness regulations for the software aspects of airborne systems and equipment certification."

==Background==
Since the release of [[DO-178B]], there have been strong calls by DERs (FAA [[Federal Aviation Administration#Designated Engineering Representative|Designated Engineering Representatives]]) for clarification/refinement of the definitions and boundaries between the key DO-178B concepts of high-level requirements, low-level requirements, and derived requirements and a better definition of the exit/entry criteria between systems requirements and system design (see [[ARP4754]]) and that of software requirements and software design (which is the domain of DO-178B). Other concerns included the meaning of verification in a [[Model-based design|model-based development paradigm]] and considerations for replacing some or all software testing activities with model simulation or formal methods. The release of DO-178C and the companion documents [[DO-278|DO-278A]] (Ground Systems), [[DO-248B|DO-248C]]&lt;!-- see discusion of update to DO-248B article --&gt; (Additional information with rationale for each DO-178C objective), DO-330 (Tool Qualification), DO-331 (Modeling), DO-332 (Object Oriented), and DO-333 (Formal Methods) were created to address the issues noted.  The SC-205 members worked with the SAE S-18 committee to ensure that ARP4754A and the above noted DO-xxx documents provide a unified and linked process with complementary criteria.

Overall, DO-178C keeps most of the DO-178B text, which has raised concerns that issues with DO-178B, such as the ambiguity about the concept of low-level requirements, may not be fully resolved.&lt;ref name=advances&gt;{{cite book|editor-last=Dale|editor-first=Chris|editor2-first=Tom|editor2-last=Anderson|title=Advances in systems safety : proceedings of the Nineteenth Safety-Critical Systems Symposium, Southampton, UK, 8-10th February 2011|year=2010|publisher=Springer|location=London|isbn=9780857291325|pages=298–299|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DEhtNRsMWXIC&amp;lpg=PA299&amp;ots=ZYDkWqUv6e&amp;dq=DO%20178B%20derived%20requirements&amp;pg=PA298#v=onepage&amp;q=DO%20178B%20derived%20requirements&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Committee organization==
The RTCA/EUROCAE joint committee work was divided into seven Subgroups:
* SG1: SCWG Document Integration
* SG2: Issues and Rationale
* SG3: Tool Qualification
* SG4: Model Based Development and Verification
* SG5: Object-Oriented Technology
* SG6: Formal Methods
* SG7: Safety Related Considerations

The Model Based Development and Verification subgroup (SG4), was the largest of the working groups. All work is collected and coordinated via a web-site that is a collaborative work management mechanism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://forum.pr.erau.edu/SCAS/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-09-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719191415/http://forum.pr.erau.edu/SCAS/ |archivedate=19 July 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Working artifacts and draft documents were held in a restricted area available to group members only.

The work was focused on bringing DO-178B/ED-12B up to date with respect to current software development practices, tools, and technologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

==Software level==
The '''Software Level''', also known as the '''Design Assurance Level''' (DAL) or '''Item Development Assurance Level''' (IDAL),&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;RTCA/DO-178C "Software Considerations in Airborne Systems and Equipment Certification", p. 116&lt;/ref&gt; is determined from the [[ARP4761|safety assessment process]] and [[hazard analysis]] by examining the effects of a failure condition in the system. The failure conditions are categorized by their effects on the aircraft, crew, and passengers.
* '''Catastrophic''' - Failure may cause deaths, usually with loss of the airplane. 
* '''Hazardous''' - Failure has a large negative impact on safety or performance, or reduces the ability of the crew to operate the aircraft due to physical distress or a higher workload, or causes serious or fatal injuries among the passengers. 
* '''Major''' - Failure significantly reduces the safety margin or significantly increases crew workload.  May result in passenger discomfort (or even minor injuries).
* '''Minor''' - Failure slightly reduces the safety margin or slightly increases crew workload.  Examples might include causing passenger inconvenience or a routine flight plan change.
* '''No Effect''' - Failure has no impact on safety, aircraft operation, or crew workload.

DO-178C alone is not intended to guarantee software safety aspects. Safety attributes in the design and as implemented as functionality must receive additional mandatory system safety tasks to drive and show objective evidence of meeting explicit safety requirements. The certification authorities require and DO-178C specifies the correct DAL be established using these comprehensive analyses methods to establish the software level A-E.  "The software level establishes the rigor necessary to demonstrate compliance" with DO-178C.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;  Any software that commands, controls, and monitors safety-critical functions should receive the highest DAL - Level A.

The number of objectives to be satisfied (some with independence) is determined by the software level A-E. The phrase "with independence" refers to a separation of  responsibilities where the objectivity of the verification and validation processes is ensured by virtue of their "independence" from the software development team.  For objectives that must be satisfied with independence, the person verifying the item (such as a requirement or source code) may not be the person who authored the item and this separation must be clearly documented.&lt;ref&gt;RTCA/DO-178C "Software Considerations in Airborne Systems and Equipment Certification", p. 41&lt;/ref&gt;

==Traceability==
[[File:DO-178C Traceability.png|thumb|Diagram illustrating the required tracing between certification artifacts, as required by the RTCA DO-178C standard.   Red-colored traces are required only for Level A.  Purple-colored traces are required for Levels A, B, and C.  Green-colored traces are for Levels A, B, C, and D.  Level E does not require any tracing.  The references on each trace arrow represent references to the standard for the objective, the activity, and the review/verification, respectively.]]
DO-178 requires a documented connection (called a trace) between the certification artifacts.  For example, a Low Level Requirement (LLR) traces up to a High Level Requirement (HLR).  A traceability analysis is then used to ensure that each requirement is fulfilled by the source code, that each requirement is tested, that each line of source code has a purpose (is connected to a requirement), and so forth.  Traceability ensures the system is complete.    The rigor and detail of the certification artifacts is related to the software level.

==Differences with DO-178B==
SC-205 was responsible for revising DO-178B/ED-12B to bring it up to date with respect to current software development and verification technologies.  The structure of the document remains largely the same from B to C. Example changes include:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news
 | title       = HighRely Synopsis of National FAA Software and Hardware Meeting Includes DO-178C Status
 | year        = 2006
 | url         = http://www.mil-embedded.com/news/Industry+News/3247
 | quote       = ''DO-178C will contain more details on software modeling and the potential ability to use modeling to supplant some of the verification techniques normally required in DO-178B. DO-178C will also more fully address OO (Object Oriented) software and the conditions under which it can be used and the certification ramifications of OO in DO-178C.''
 | accessdate  = 30 September 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Provide clearer language and terminology, provide more consistency
* More objectives (for Levels A, B, and C)
* Clarified the "hidden objective", applicable to Level A, which was implied by [[DO-178B]] in section 6.4.4.2b but not listed in the Annex A tables.  This objective is now explicitly listed in DO-178C, Annex A, Table A-7, Objective 9: "Verification of additional code, that cannot be traced to Source Code, is achieved."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
 | title       = RTCA/DO-178C Software Considerations in Airborne Systems and Equipment Certification
 | publisher   = RTCA, Inc.
 | year        = 2011
 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Parameter Data Item Files - Provides separate information that influences the behavior of an executable object code (without changing it).  An example would be a configuration file that sets up the schedule and major time frames of a partitioned operating system.  The parameter data item file must be verified together with the executable object code, or else it must be tested for all possible ranges of the parameter data items.
* [[DO-330]] "Software Tool Qualification Considerations", a new “domain independent, external document”, was developed to provide guidance for an acceptable tool qualification process. While DO-178C was used as the basis of the development of this new document, the text was adapted to be directly and separately applicable to tool development and to address all tool aspects.  Tool Qualification guidance was removed in DO-178C, replaced with guidance for deciding when to apply DO-330 tool qualification guidance to tools used in a DO-178C context.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Pothon |first= Frédéric, et al, |date= 2012 |title= DO-178C/ED-12C versus DO-178B/ED-12B Changes and Improvements  |url= http://www.adacore.com/uploads/technical-papers/DO178C-ED12C-Changes_and_Improvements-Sep2012.pdf |page= 49 |accessdate= 2015-01-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Technology supplements were added to ''extend'' the guidance of the DO-178C document to specific techniques. Rather than expanding the prior text to account for all current and future software development techniques, supplements are made available to explicitly add, delete, or otherwise modify the guidance of the core standard for application to specific techniques or technologies. All guidance in these supplements are written in the context of the affected guidance elements in DO-178C and so should be considered as at the same level of authority as that core document.&lt;ref&gt;Pothon, pp. 43-46 &lt;/ref&gt;
** [[DO-331]] "Model-Based Development and Verification Supplement to DO-178C and DO-278A" - addressing Model-Based Development (MBD) and verification and the ability to use modeling techniques to improve development and verification while avoiding pitfalls inherent in some modeling methods
** [[DO-332]] "Object-Oriented Technology and Related Techniques Supplement to DO-178C and DO-278A" - addressing [[Object-oriented programming|object-oriented software]] and the conditions under which it may be used
** [[DO-333]] "Formal Methods Supplement to DO-178C and DO-278A" - addressing [[formal methods]] to complement (but not replace) testing

===Guidelines vs. Guidance===
DO-178B was not completely consistent in the use of the terms Guidelines and Guidance within the text.  "Guidance" conveys a slightly stronger sense of obligation than "guidelines".  As such, with the DO-178C, the SCWG has settled on the use of “guidance” for all the statements that are considered as "recommendations", replacing the remaining instances of "guidelines" with “supporting information” and using that phrase wherever the text is more "information" oriented than "recommendation" oriented.  

The entire DO-248C/ED-94C document, "Supporting Information for DO-178C and DO-278A", falls into the “supporting information” category, not guidance.&lt;ref&gt;Pothon, p. 14 &lt;/ref&gt;

==Sample difference between DO-178B and DO-178C==
Chapter 6.1 defines the purpose for the software verification process. DO-178C adds the following statement about the Executable Object Code:
* "The Executable Object Code satisfies the software requirements (that is, intended  function), and provides confidence in the absence of unintended functionality."
* "The Executable Object Code is robust with respect to the software requirements that it can respond correctly to abnormal inputs and conditions."
As a comparison, DO-178B states the following with regard to the Executable Object Code:
* "The Executable Object Code satisfies the software requirements."
The additional clarification fills a gap that a software developer may encounter when interpreting the document.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://alm.parasoft.com/achieving-do178c-compliance/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-03-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140911083554/http://alm.parasoft.com/achieving-do178c-compliance |archivedate=11 September 2014 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Dartmouth Summer Research Project on Artificial Intelligence''' was the name of a 1956 summer workshop now considered by many&lt;ref&gt;Solomonoff, R.J.The Time Scale of Artificial Intelligence; Reflections on Social Effects, Human Systems Management, Vol 5 1985, Pp 149-153&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Moor, J., The Dartmouth College Artificial Intelligence Conference: The Next Fifty years, AI Magazine, Vol 27, No., 4, Pp. 87-9, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; (though not all&lt;ref&gt;Kline, Ronald R., Cybernetics, Automata Studies and the Dartmouth Conference on Artificial Intelligence, IEEE Annals of the History of Computing, October–December, 2011, IEEE Computer Society&lt;/ref&gt;) to be the [[wikt:seminal|seminal]] event for [[artificial intelligence]] as a field.

The project lasted approximately six to eight weeks, and was essentially an extended [[brainstorming]] session. Eleven mathematicians and scientists were originally planned to be attendees, and while not all attended, more than ten others came for short times.

== Background ==

In the early 1950s, there were various names for the field of "thinking machines" such as cybernetics, automata theory, and complex information processing.&lt;ref&gt;McCorduck, P., Machines Who Think, A.K. Peters, Ltd, Second Edition, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; These indicate how different the ideas were on what such machines would be like.

In 1955 [[John McCarthy (computer scientist)|John McCarthy]], then a young Assistant Professor of Mathematics at [[Dartmouth College]], decided to organize a group to clarify and develop ideas about thinking machines. He picked the name 'Artificial Intelligence' for the new field. He chose the name partly for its neutrality; avoiding a focus on narrow automata theory, and avoiding cybernetics which was heavily focused on analog feedback, as well as him potentially having to accept the assertive [[Norbert Wiener]] as guru or having to argue with him.&lt;ref&gt;Nilsson, N., The Quest for Artificial Intelligence, Cambridge University Press, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 1955, McCarthy approached the Rockefeller Foundation to request funding for a summer seminar at Dartmouth for about 10 participants. In June, he and [[Claude Shannon]], a founder of Information Theory then at Bell Labs, met with Robert Morison, Director of Biological and Medical Research to discuss the idea and possible funding, though Morison, was unsure whether money would be made available for such a visionary project.&lt;ref&gt;Kline, Ronald R., Cybernetics, Automata Studies and the Dartmouth Conference on Artificial Intelligence, IEEE Annals of the History of Computing, October–December, 2011, IEEE Computer Society, (citing letters, from Rockefeller Foundation Archives, Dartmouth file6, 17, 1955 etc.&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 2, 1955, the project was formally proposed by McCarthy, [[Marvin Minsky]], [[Nathaniel Rochester (computer scientist)|Nathaniel Rochester]] and [[Claude Shannon]]. The proposal is credited with introducing the term 'artificial intelligence'.

The Proposal states&lt;ref&gt;McCarthy, J., Minsky, M., Rochester, N., Shannon, C.E., A Proposal for the Dartmouth Summer Research Project on Artificial Intelligence., http://raysolomonoff.com/dartmouth/boxa/dart564props.pdf August, 1955&lt;/ref&gt;
{{cquote|We propose that a 2-month, 10-man study of artificial intelligence be carried out during the summer of 1956 at Dartmouth College in [[Hanover, New Hampshire]]. The study is to proceed on the basis of the conjecture that every aspect of learning or any other feature of intelligence can in principle be so precisely described that a machine can be made to simulate it. An attempt will be made to find how to make machines use language, form abstractions and concepts, solve kinds of problems now reserved for humans, and improve themselves. We think that a significant advance can be made in one or more of these problems if a carefully selected group of scientists work on it together for a summer.}}
The proposal goes on to discuss [[computers]], [[natural language processing]], [[neural networks]], [[theory of computation]], [[abstraction]] and [[creativity]] (these areas within the field of artificial intelligence are considered still relevant to the work of the field).

According to [[Stottler Henke Associates]], besides the proposal's authors, attendees at the conference included [[Ray Solomonoff]], [[Oliver Selfridge]], [[Trenchard More]], [[Arthur Samuel]], [[Herbert A. Simon]], and [[Allen Newell]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stottlerhenke.com/ai_general/history.htm Stottler-Henke] retrieved 18:19 (UTC), 27th of July 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dartmouth.edu/~vox/0607/0724/ai50.html Artificial Intelligence: Past, Present, and Future (Vox of Dartmouth)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dartmouth.edu/~ai50/homepage.html The Dartmouth Artificial Intelligence Conference: The Next Fifty Years]&lt;/ref&gt;

The actual participants came at different times, mostly for much shorter times. Trenchard More replaced Rochester for three weeks and MacKay and Holland did not attend --- but the project was set to begin. 
 
Around June 18, 1956, the earliest participants (perhaps only Ray Solomonoff, maybe with Tom Etter) arrived at the Dartmouth campus in Hanover, N.H., to join John McCarthy who already had an apartment there. Ray and Marvin stayed at Professors' apartments, but most would stay at the Hanover Inn.

== Dates ==

The Dartmouth Workshop is said to have run for six weeks in the summer of 1956.&lt;ref&gt;Nilsson, N., The Quest for Artificial Intelligence, Cambridge University Press, 2010, P. 53&lt;/ref&gt; Ray Solomonoff's notes written during the Workshop, however, say it ran for roughly eight weeks, from about June 18 to August 17.&lt;ref&gt;

Solomonoff's Dartmouth notes start on June 22; June 28 mentions Minsky, June 30 mentions Hanover, N.H., July 1 mentions Tom Etter. On August 17, Ray gave a final talk.&lt;ref&gt;Papers at http://raysolomonoff.com/dartmouth/boxbdart/boxbdart.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== Participants ==

Initially, McCarthy lost his list of attendees. Instead, after the workshop, McCarthy sent Ray a preliminary list of participants and visitors plus those interested in the subject. There were 47 people listed.&lt;ref&gt;McCarthy, J., List, Sept., 1956; List among Solomonoff papers to be posted on website solomonof.com&lt;/ref&gt;

Solomonoff, however, made a complete list in his notes of the summer project:&lt;ref&gt;http://raysolomonoff.com/dartmouth/boxbdart/dart56ray812825who.pdf 1956&lt;/ref&gt;

# [[Ray Solomonoff]]

Shannon attended Ray's talk on July 10 and Bigelow gave a talk on August 15. Ray doesn't mention Bernard Widrow, but apparently he visited, along with W.A. Clark and B.G. Farley.&lt;ref&gt;Kline, Ronald R., Cybernetics, Automata Studies and the Dartmouth Conference on Artificial Intelligence, IEEE Annals of the History of Computing, October–December, 2011, IEEE Computer Society&lt;/ref&gt; Trenchard mentions R. Culver and Ray mentions Bill Shutz. Herb Gelernter didn't attend, but was influenced later by what Rochester learned.&lt;ref&gt;Nilsson, N., The Quest for Artificial Intelligence, Cambridge University Press, 2010,&lt;/ref&gt; Gloria Minsky also commuted there (with their part-beagle dog, Senje, who would start out in the car back seat and end up curled around her like a scarf), and attended some sessions (without Senje).&lt;ref&gt;personal communication&lt;/ref&gt;

Ray Solomonoff, Marvin Minsky, and John McCarthy were the only three who stayed for the full-time.  Trenchard took attendance during two weeks of his three-week visit. From three to about eight people would attend the daily sessions.&lt;ref&gt;More, Trenchard, 1956, http://raysolomonoff.com/dartmouth/boxa/dart56more5th6thweeks.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

== Event and aftermath ==

They had the entire top floor of the Dartmouth Math Department to themselves, and most weekdays they would meet at the main math classroom where someone might lead a discussion focusing on his/her ideas, or more frequently, a general discussion would be held.

It was not a directed group research project, discussions covered many topics but several directions are considered to have been initiated or encouraged by the Workshop: the rise of symbolic methods,  systems focussed on limited domains (early Expert Systems), and deductive systems versus inductive systems. One participant, Arthur Samuel said, "It was very interesting, very stimulating, very exciting".&lt;ref&gt;McCorduck, P., Machines Who Think, A.K. Peters, Ltd, Second Edition, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ray Solomonoff kept notes giving his impression of the talks and the ideas from various discussions.&lt;ref&gt;http://raysolomonoff.com/dartmouth/&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Snail-front-0A.jpg|thumb|[[Pulmonata|Pulmonate]] [[land snail]]s usually have two sets of [[tentacle]]s on their head: the upper pair have an eye at the end; the lower pair are for [[olfaction]].&lt;ref name="sluganatomy"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allaboutslugs.com/slug-and-snail-science/slug-anatomy/|title=Slug and Snail Anatomy|publisher=All About Slugs|access-date=7 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

In [[anatomy]], an '''eyestalk''' (sometimes spelled as '''eye stalk''' or known as an '''ommatophore''') is a protrusion that extends the eye away from the body, giving the eye a better field of [[visual perception|vision]].&lt;ref name="sluganatomy" /&gt; It is a common feature in nature and frequently appears in fiction.

In nature, eyestalks are sometimes called "[[tentacle]]s", and may also have [[olfactory]] organs at their ends; examples of creatures with olfactory eyestalks include [[snail]]s, the [[trilobite]] superfamily [[Asaphida]], and the fly family [[Diopsidae]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11526">'''Flexible Endoscopic Evaluation of Swallowing with Sensory Testing''' ('''FEESST'''), or '''laryngopharyngeal sensory testing''', is a technique used to directly examine motor and sensory functions of swallowing so that proper treatment can be given to patients with swallowing difficulties to decrease their risk of aspiration (food and liquids going into the lungs instead of the stomach) and choking. 
FEESST was invented by [[Jonathan E. Aviv|Dr. Jonathan E. Aviv MD]], FACS in 1993,&lt;ref&gt;Aviv JE, Martin JH, Keen MS, Debell M, Blitzer A. Air-pulse quantification of supraglottic and pharyngeal sensation: a new technique.

Laryngopharyngeal sensory deficits as a predictor of aspiration. Oto Head Neck Surg 2001; 124: 622-624.&lt;/ref&gt; for the past 20 years.

Swallowing consists of two distinct but interrelated processes: 1. Moving food and liquids from the mouth into the stomach through a set of coordinated muscle movements of the mouth [[larynx]], [[pharynx]] and the [[esophagus]] 2. Protecting the airway to prevent food and liquids from entering the lungs.&lt;ref&gt;Zamir Z, Ren J, Hogan W, Shaker R. Coordination of deglutitive vocal cord closure and oral-pharyngeal swallowing events in the elderly. European J Gastro Hepatol 1996; 8: 425-429.&lt;/ref&gt;
This natural process of swallowing can be disrupted in many ways. The problem can occur when the movements involved in swallowing are restricted due to a tumor, any type of blockage, or paralysis after a stroke. Besides the motor problems, swallowing can be impaired due to sensory dysfunction, meaning when sensation (the ability to feel) is lost or reduced anywhere in the throat area. The loss of sensation can be caused by a problem originating in the brain, such as what happens after certain types of stroke, or it can be a result of a nerve injury or swelling in the actual throat area.

FEESST is the only test currently available which can identify if there is any loss of sensation in the throat area. Before FEESST was invented, all tests of swallowing, be they X-ray based tests (Modified Barium Swallow (MBS)&lt;ref&gt;Brady S, Donzelli J. The modified barium swallow and the functional endoscopic evaluation of swallowing. Otolaryngol Clin North Am. 2013 Dec;46(6):1009-22&lt;/ref&gt; or endoscopy-based tests (Fiberoptic Endoscopic Evaluation of Swallowing (FEES)&lt;ref&gt;Logemann, J. Role of the Modified Barium Swallow in Management of Patients with Dysphagia. Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg 1997;116: 335-338.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bastian RW. Videoendoscopic evaluation of patients with dysphagia: An adjunct to modified barium swallow. Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg 1991; 104: 339-350.&lt;/ref&gt; solely looked at the motor component of swallowing without examining the sensory aspect of a swallow or the ability to feel.

== Technique ==
FEESST is an outpatient procedure involving the passing of a thin flexible scope through the nose to the [[pharynx]]. The exam consisting of two parts. First part assesses sensation in the pharynx and airway protection. The airway protection is assessed by sending air-pulses to the throat area that is innervated by the [[vagus nerve]], which is the region of the throat between the top of the vocal folds to the tip of the epiglottis in order to stimulate an airway protective reflex called the laryngeal adductor reflex (LAR). This reflex, which occurs when the tissues of the throat are stimulated, causes the vocal folds to close in order to protect the airway from food going into the lungs. Since the windpipe (trachea) is located so close to the food-pipe (esophagus) this is a critical [[reflex]] to be functioning well at all times. Stimulation of this reflex not only results in protection of the airway, it also initiates a swallow. When a swallow is initiated the larynx rises up to two inches, going further away from the esophagus, thereby acting as an additional cover for the airway.

During the air pulse administration part of the test it is determined if the reflex (LAR) that initiates the swallow is being responsive enough. The responsiveness depends on the ability of the vagus nerve to feel so that it can properly send the impulse to the brain to initiate the LAR. If there is any injury or swelling of the [[vagus nerve]], the sensation will be diminished. As a result, the reflex responsible for protecting the airway will be affected. During sensory testing it has been shown that a much stronger stimulus is necessary to elicit the LAR if there is any desensitization to the vagus nerve. The second part of the FEESST test involves giving food to the patient and tracking where the food travels in the throat region. Green food coloring is typically given in the food to track the food as it travels along the natural pink-colored tissues of the throat.

If the food that is given is seen to stick to on one side of the throat, which is called food “residue”, that usually means that there is lack of sensation or possibly even a motor/movement problem on that particular side of the throat. The treatment for this discovered throat numbness is to then teach the patient to turn their head to the numb side of their throat when they swallow. This maneuver, called a "head turn" effectively closes off the numb side of the throat so when they swallow the food is only exposed to the normal side of the throat, thereby insuring a safer swallow (on the normal side there is no residue so there is no chance of the residue accidentally falling into the vocal folds and then into the lungs (aspiration).

=== Vagus Nerve Injury ===

When there is damage to the nerve that innervates the throat, the vagus nerve, both motor and sensory function can be affected since the vagus contains both motor and sensory nerve fibers. However, until sensory testing was developed there was no way to assess sensory loss from a vagus nerve injury. One of the most common symptoms of a vagus nerve injury is chronic cough. If a physician looked into the vocal cords of a patient with chronic cough it would appear they are opening and closing normally, however if  sensory testing was performed it would give abnormal results thus indicating that the sensory nerve fibers of the vagus were somehow damaged. This would allow for a more precise diagnosis and treatment.&lt;ref&gt;Cukier-Blaj S, Bewley A, Aviv JE, Murry T. Paradoxical vocal fold motion: a sensory-motor laryngeal disorder. Laryngoscope 2008; 118:367-70.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Aviv JE, Murry T. Sensory Testing Alone. In: Aviv JE, Murry T, eds. FEESST: Flexible Endoscopic Evaluation of Swallowing with Sensory Testing. San Diego, CA: Plural Publishing; 2005: 57-70.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Aviv JE. Cough It Up! Cough and Throatburn Reflux. In Aviv JE. Killing Me Softly From Inside. The Mysteries and Dangers of Acid Reflux and Its Connection to America’s Fastest Growing Cancer with a Diet That May Save Your Life. North Charleston, SC: Create Space Independent Publishing Platform 2014: 23-33.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another clinical situation where assessment of laryngeal sensation is helpful is in patients complaining of throat pain. Again, when examining the throat of such patients, if everything seemed to be moving well, then clinicians are often befuddled as to what the source of the throat pain is. With sensory testing, one can demonstrate that the throat tissues are numb, signifying some damage to the sensory fibers of the vagus and thereby identify vagus nerve injury as the cause of the patient’s pain. This is called vagus nerve neuralgia  and treatment for neuralgia can then commence.

One always sensory tests both the right and left sides of throat and the sensory levels should be symmetric, that is, the right side of the throat should normally equal the left side. However, if during sensory testing it is determined that one side is normal and the other side has a sensory deficit, then likely something has injured the vagus nerve somewhere along it lengthy course from the brain into the neck. As a result, when there is asymmetric sensory nerve loss, imaging of the neck and brain must be done to see where along the course of the vagus nerve a blockage or injury might have taken place.&lt;ref&gt;Aviv JE, Murry T. Sensory Testing Alone. In: Aviv JE, Murry T, eds. FEESST: Flexible Endoscopic Evaluation of Swallowing with Sensory Testing. San Diego, CA: Plural Publishing; 2005: 57-70.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Aviv JE, Collins S.

Cummings Otolaryngology Head And Neck Surgery, 5th Edition, Philadelphia PA, Elsevier Mosby; 2009: 894-903.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Indications For Sensory Testing of The Throat ==

=== Acid Reflux Disease ===

Over the past 20 years, primarily due to work with sensory testing performed by gastroenterologists (stomach doctors) and pulmonologists (lung doctors), sensory testing and FEESST have been shown to have additional applications beyond assessing swallowing function.
 
For example, people with acid reflux disease, especially those with Throatburn Reflux usually have swollen vocal cords due to years of acid damage. Untreated acid-injured vocal cords will not have as sharp reflexes as vocal cords that are not swollen. Therefore, aspiration is common in people with chronic acid reflux disease. Sensory testing can quantify and assess the swelling for better treatment. The strength of the air pulse given during sensory testing in acid-injured vocal cords due to acid reflux disease will necessarily be much greater in order to elicit an airway reflex than tissues that are not swollen.&lt;ref&gt;Phua SY, McGarvey LPA, Ngu MC, Ing AJ. Patients with gastro-oesophageal reflux disease and cough have impaired laryngopharyngeal mechanosensitivity Thorax 2005; 60:488-491.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Clayton NA, Carnaby-Mann GD, Peters MJ, Ing AJ. The effect of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease on laryngopharyngeal sensitivity. Ear Nose Throat J. 2012 Sep;91(9):370-382.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Botoman VA, Hanft KL, Breno SM, Vickers D, Astor FC, Caristo IB, Alemar GO, Sheth S, Bonner GF.

Thirty years of restoration research now challenge this: a) This site in Doi Suthep-Pui National Park, N. Thailand was deforested, over-cultivated and then burnt.

'''Forest restoration''' is defined as “actions to re-instate ecological processes, which accelerate recovery of forest structure, ecological functioning and biodiversity levels towards those typical of [[Ecological succession#Climax community|climax forest]]”&lt;ref&gt;Elliott, S., D. Blakesley and K. Hardwick, in press. Restoring Tropical Forests: a Practical Guide. Kew Publications, London&lt;/ref&gt; i.e. the end-stage of natural forest [[secondary succession|succession]]. Climax forests are relatively stable ecosystems that have developed the maximum biomass, structural complexity and species diversity that are possible ''within the limits imposed by climate and soil and without continued disturbance from humans'' [[Climax community|(more explanation here)]]. Climax forest is therefore the target ecosystem, which defines the ultimate aim of forest restoration. Since climate is a major factor that determines climax forest composition, global climate change may result in changing restoration aims.&lt;ref&gt;Sgró, C.M., A. J. Lowe and A. A. Hoffmann, 2011. Building evolutionary resilience for conserving biodiversity under climate change. Evolutionary Applications 4 (2): 326-337&lt;/ref&gt;

Forest restoration is a specialized form of [[reforestation]], but it differs from conventional tree plantations in that its primary goals are [[biodiversity]] recovery and environmental protection.&lt;ref name="Lamb"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Regreening the Bare Hills|last = Lamb|first = David|publisher = Springer|year = 2011|isbn = 978-90-481-9870-2|location = |pages = 547|url = https://www.springer.com/us/book/9789048198696}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Stanturf"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Restoration of boreal and temperate forests|last = Stanturf|first = John A.|publisher = CRC Press|year = 2005|isbn = |location = Boca Raton|pages = 3–11|chapter = What is forest restoration?|url = http://www.treesearch.fs.fed.us/pubs/22209}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scope==
Forest restoration may include simply protecting remnant vegetation (fire prevention, cattle exclusion etc.) or more active interventions to accelerate natural regeneration,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Assisted natural regeneration of forests|url = http://www.fao.org/forestry/anr/en/|website = www.fao.org|access-date = 2016-02-24|first = Food and Agriculture Organization of the United|last = Nations}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as [[tree planting]] and/or sowing seeds ([[direct seeding]]) of species characteristic of the target ecosystem. Tree species planted (or encouraged to establish) are those that are typical of, or provide a critical ecological function in, the target ecosystem. However, wherever people live in or near restoration sites, restoration projects often include economic species amongst the planted trees, to yield subsistence or cash-generating products.

Forest restoration is an inclusive process, which depends on collaboration among a wide range of stakeholders including local communities, government officials, non-government organizations, scientists and funding agencies. Its ecological success is measured in terms of increased biological diversity, biomass, [[primary productivity]], [[soil organic matter]] and water-holding capacity, as well as the return of rare and [[keystone species]], characteristic of the target ecosystem. Economic indices of success include the value of forest products and ecological services generated (e.g. watershed protection, carbon storage etc.), which ultimately contribute towards poverty reduction. [[payment for ecosystem services|Payments for such ecological services (PES)]] and forest products can provide strong incentives for local people to implement restoration projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Martínez de Aragón|first1=Juan|last2=Fischer|first2=Christine|last3=Bonet|first3=Jose-Antonio|last4=Olivera|first4=Antoni|last5=Oliach|first5=Daniel|last6=Colinas|first6=Carlos|title=Economically profitable post fire restoration with black truffle (Tuber melanosporum) producing plantations|journal=New Forests|date=2012|volume=43|pages=615–630}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Opportunities for forest restoration ==
[[File:ESF-Forest-Restoration-Corner-2014.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Demonstration forest restoration plot, [[State University of New York College of Environmental Science and Forestry|SUNY-ESF]], Syracuse, NY]]

Forest restoration is appropriate wherever biodiversity recovery is one of the main goals of reforestation, such as for wildlife conservation, environmental protection, eco-tourism or to supply a wide variety of forest products to local communities. Forests can be restored in a wide range of circumstances, but degraded sites within protected areas are a high priority, especially where some climax forest remains as a seed source within the landscape. Even in protected areas, there are often large deforested sites: logged over areas or sites formerly cleared for agriculture. If protected areas are to act as Earth’s last wildlife refuges, restoration of such areas will be needed.&lt;ref name ="Lamb"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Stanturf" /&gt;

Many restoration projects are now being implemented under the umbrella of “[[forest landscape restoration]]” (FLR),&lt;ref&gt;Mansourian, S., D. Vallauri, and N. Dudley (eds.) (in co-operation with WWF International), 2005. Forest Restoration in Landscapes: Beyond Planting Trees. Springer, New York&lt;/ref&gt; defined as a “planned process to regain ecological integrity and enhance human well-being in deforested or degraded landscapes”. FLR recognizes that forest restoration has social and economic functions. It aims to achieve the best possible compromise between meeting both conservation goals and the needs of rural communities.&lt;ref&gt;Reitbergen-McCraken, J., S. Maginnis A. Sarre, 2007. The Forest Landscape Restoration Handbook. Earthscan, London, 175 pp.&lt;/ref&gt; As human pressure on landscapes increases, forest restoration will most commonly be practiced within a mosaic of other forms of forest management, to meet the economic needs of local people.

== Natural regeneration ==

Tree planting is not always essential to restore forest ecosystems. A lot can be achieved by studying how forests regenerate naturally, identifying the factors that limit regeneration and devising methods to overcome them. These can include weeding and adding fertilizer around natural tree seedlings, preventing fire, removing cattle and so on. This is "accelerated" or "assisted" [[natural regeneration]].&lt;ref&gt;Shono, K., E. A. Cadaweng and P. B. Durst, 2007. Application of Assisted Natural Regeneration to Restore Degraded Tropical Forestlands. Restoration Ecology, 15(4): 620–626.&lt;/ref&gt; It is simple and cost-effective, but it can only operate on trees that are already present, mostly light-loving [[pioneer species]]. Such tree species are not usually those that comprise climax forests, but they can foster recolonization of the site by shade-tolerant climax forest tree species, via natural seed dispersal from remnant forest. Because this is a slow process, biodiversity recovery can usually be accelerated by planting some climax forest tree species, especially large-seeded, poorly dispersed species. It is not feasible to plant all the tree species that may have formerly grown in the original primary forest and it is usually unnecessary to do so, if the [[framework species method]]&lt;ref&gt;Elliott S, Navakitbumrung P, Kuarak C, Zankum S, Anusarnsunthorn V, Blakesley D, 2003. Selecting framework tree species for restoring seasonally dry tropical forests in northern Thailand based on field performance. For Ecol Manage 184:177-191&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Goosem, S. and N. I. J. Tucker, 1995. Repairing the Rainforest. Wet Tropics Management Authority, Cairns, Australia. Pp 72. http://www.wettropics.gov.au/media/med_landholders.html&lt;/ref&gt; can be used.

== Post-fire regeneration ==

In large parts of the world, forest fires cover a heavy toll on forests. That can be because of provoked deforestation in order to substitute forests by crop areas, or in dry areas, because of wild fires occurring naturally or intentionally. A whole section of forest landscape restoration in linked to this particular problem, as in many cases, the net loss of ecosystem value is very high and can open the drop to an accelerated further degradation of the soil conditions through erosion and [[desertification]]. This indeed has dire consequences on both the quality of the habitats and their related fauna. Nevertheless, in some specific cases, wild fires do actually allow to increase the bio[[diversity index]] of the burnt area,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Regos|first1=Adrian|last2=D'Amen|first2=M|last3=Titeux|first3=Nicolas|last4=Herrando|first4=Sergi|last5=Guisan|first5=A|last6=Brotons|first6=Lluis|title=Predicting the future effectiveness of protected areas for bird conservation in Mediterranean ecosystems under climate change and novel fire regime scenarios|journal=Diversity and Distributions|date=2016|volume=22|issue=1|pages=83–96|doi=10.1111/ddi.12375}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which case the Forest Restoration Strategies tend to look for a different land-use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Martín-Alcón|first1=Santiago|last2=Coll|first2=Lluis|title=Unraveling the relative importance of factors driving post-fire regeneration trajectories in non-serotinous Pinus nigra forests|journal=Forest Ecology and Management|date=2016|volume=361|pages=13–22|doi=10.1016/j.foreco.2015.11.006|url=http://arxiudigital.ctfc.cat/docs/upload/27_489_Martin-Alcon_and_Coll_2016_FORECO.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Forest restoration projects==

===Ashland Forest Resiliency Stewardship Project===

The Ashland Forest Resiliency Stewardship Project (AFR)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = City of Ashland, Oregon - Ashland Forest Resiliency Project - What is AFR?|url = http://www.ashland.or.us/Page.asp?NavID=12907|website = www.ashland.or.us|access-date = 2016-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a decade long, science-based project launched in 2010 with the intent of reducing severe wildfire risk, but also protecting water quality, old-growth forest, wildlife, people, property, and the overall quality of life within the Ashland watershed. The primary stakeholders in this cooperative restoration effort are the U.S. Forest Service, the City of Ashland, Lomaktsi Restoration Project, and the Nature Conservancy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Ashland Forest Resilency Project - Lomakatsi Restoration Project|url = http://lomakatsi.org/ashland-forest-resilency-project/|website = Lomakatsi Restoration Project|access-date = 2016-02-05|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project was launched with initial funding from the Economic Recovery stimulus, and has more recently received funding from the Forest Service Hazardous Fuels program and the Joint Chiefs Landscape Restoration Partnerships program to back the project through 2016 .

Located in the dry forests of southern Oregon, the threat of wildfire is a reality for land managers and property owners alike. The boundaries of the city of Ashland intersect with the surrounding forest in what is referred to as the wildland-urban interface (WUI).&lt;ref&gt;Toman, E., Stidham, M., Shindler, B., McCaffrey, S. 2011. Reducing fuels in the wildland-urban interface: community perceptions of agency fuel treatments. Intl. Journal of Wildland Fire 20 (3):340-349&lt;/ref&gt; Historically, the forests of this region experienced a relatively frequent fire return interval, which prevented buildup of heavy fuel loads.&lt;ref&gt;Hagmann, R.K., Franklin, J.F., Johnson, N.K. 2013. Historical structure and composition of ponderosa pine and mixed-conifer forests in south-central Oregon. Forest Ecology and Management 304: 492-504&lt;/ref&gt; A century of fire exclusion and suppression on federal lands in the Pacific Northwest has led to increased forest density and fuel loads, and thus a more persistent threat of devastating wildfire.&lt;ref&gt;Franklin, J.F., and Johnson, K.N. 2012. A restoration framework for federal forests in the Pacific Northwest. Journal of Forestry 110 (8): 429-439&lt;/ref&gt;

The AFR project has implemented restoration techniques and prescriptions that aim to replicate the process of [[ecological succession]] in dry, mixed-conifer forests of the Pacific Northwest. The approach involves a combination of fuels reduction, thinning small-diameter trees, and carrying out prescribed burns. Priority is given to maintaining ecological function and complexity by retaining the largest and oldest trees, preserving wildlife habitat and riparian areas, and protecting erodible soils and maintaining slope stability.

Since its inception in 2010, the AFR project has completed restoration work on 4,000 of the 7,600 acres slated for the project. The project has provided educational experience to over 2,000 students and has benefitted the local community by creating jobs and providing workforce training. Currently, helicopter logging operations are thinning 1,100 acres of the watershed while controlled burning operations take place as air quality conditions allow.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = City of Ashland, Oregon - Ashland Forest Resiliency Project - AFR Work Update|url = http://www.ashland.or.us/Page.asp?NavID=13128|website = www.ashland.or.us|access-date = 2016-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Forest landscape restoration==
Forest landscape restoration (FLR) is defined as “a planned process to regain ecological integrity and enhance human well-being in [[deforested]] or [[land degradation|degraded]] landscapes”.&lt;ref&gt;Reitbergen-McCraken, J., S. Maginnis A. Sarre, 2007. ''The Forest Landscape Restoration Handbook''. Earthscan, London, 175 pp&lt;/ref&gt; It comprises  tools and procedures to integrate site-level forest restoration actions with desirable landscape-level objectives, which are decided upon via various participatory mechanisms among stakeholders. The concept has grown out of collaboration among some of the world's major international conservation organizations including the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] (IUCN), the [[World Wide Fund for Nature]] (WWF), the [[World Resources Institute]] and the [[International Tropical Timber Organization]] (ITTO).

===Aims===
The concept of FLR was conceived to bring about compromises between meeting the needs of both humans and wildlife, by [[land restoration|restoring]] a range of forest functions at the landscape level. It includes actions to strengthen the resilience and ecological integrity of landscapes and thereby keep future management options open. The participation of local communities is central to the concept, because they play a critical role in shaping the landscape and gain significant benefits from restored forest resources. Therefore, FLR activities are inclusive and participatory.&lt;ref&gt;Lamb, D., 2011. ''Regreening the Bare Hills''. Springer 547pp.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Desirable outcomes ===
The desirable outcomes of an FLR program usually comprise a combination of the following, depending on local needs and aspirations:
*identification of the root causes of [[forest degradation]] and prevention of further deforestation,
*positive engagement of people in the planning of forest restoration, resolution of [[land-use conflict]]s and agreement on benefit-sharing systems,
*compromises over [[land-use]] trade-offs that are acceptable to the majority of stakeholders,
*a repository of [[biological diversity]] of both local and global value,
*delivery of a range of utilitarian benefits to local communities including:
**a reliable supply of clean water,
**[[environmental protection]] particularly [[Drainage basin|watershed]] services (e.g. reduced soil erosion, lower landslide risk, flood/drought mitigation etc.),
**a sustainable supply of a diverse range of forest products including foods, medicines, firewood etc.,
**monetary income from various sources e.g. [[ecotourism]], [[carbon trading]] via the [[Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation|REDD+]] mechanism and from [[payment for ecosystem services|payments for other environmental services (PES)]]&lt;ref&gt;Mansourian, S., D. Vallauri, and N. , Dudley (eds.) (in co-operation with WWF International), ''Forest Restoration in Landscapes: Beyond Planting Trees''. Springer, New York.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Activities===
FLR combines several existing principles and techniques of development, conservation and natural resource management, such as landscape character assessment, [[participatory rural appraisal]], [[adaptive management]] etc. within a clear and consistent evaluation and learning framework. An FLR program may comprise various forestry practices on different sites within the landscape, depending on local environmental and socioeconomic factors. These may include protection and management of secondary and degraded primary forests, standard forest restoration techniques such as "assisted" or "accelerated" [[natural regeneration]] (ANR) and the planting of [[framework tree species]] to restore degraded areas, as well as conventional tree plantations and [[agroforestry]] systems to meet more immediate monetary needs &lt;ref&gt;Elliott, S., D. Blakesley and K. Hardwick, in press. ''Restoring Tropical Forests: a Practical Guide''. Kew Publications, London&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[International Union for Conservation of Nature|IUCN]] hosts the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature#The Global Partnership on Forest Landscape Restoration|Global Partnership on Forest Landscape Restoration]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Global Partnership on Forest and Landscape Restoration|url=http://www.forestlandscaperestoration.org/|website=The Global Partnership on Forest and Landscape Restoration|publisher=IUCN}}&lt;/ref&gt; which co-ordinates development of the concept around the world.

In 2014, the [[Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations]] established the Forest and Landscape Restoration Mechanism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations|title=Forest and Landscape Restoration Mechanism|url=http://www.fao.org/forestry/flrm/en/|publisher=Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Mechanism supports countries to implement FLR as a contribution to achieving the [[Bonn Challenge]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Global Partnership on Forest Landscape Restoration|title=The Bonn Challenge|url=http://www.bonnchallenge.org/|website=The Bonn Challenge|publisher=International Union for Conservation of Nature}}&lt;/ref&gt; - the restoration of 150 million hectare of deforested and degraded lands by 2020 - and the [[Convention on Biological Diversity]] Aichi Biodiversity Targets&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Convention on Biological Diversity|title=Aichi Biodiversity Targets|url=https://www.cbd.int/doc/strategic-plan/targets/T15-quick-guide-en.pdf|publisher=Convention on Biological Diversity}}&lt;/ref&gt; - related to ecosystem conservation and restoration.

In partnership with the [[UNCCD|Global Mechanism of the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification]], FAO released two discussion papers on sustainable financing for FLR in 2015. ''Sustainable Financing for Forest and Landscape Restoration: The Role of Public Policy Makers'' provides recommendations and examples of FLR financing for countrues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Sustainable Financing for Forest and Landscape Restoration. The Role of Public Policy Makers|date=June 2015|publisher=Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations and the Global Mechanism of the UNCCD|url=http://www.fao.org/3/a-i5032e.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Sustainable Financing for Forest and Landscape Restoration - Opportunities, challenges and the way forward'' provides an overview of funding sources and financial instruments available for FLR activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Sustainable Financing for Forest and Landscape Restoration - Opportunities, challenges and the way forward|date=June 2015|publisher=Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations and the Global Mechanism of the UNCCD|isbn=978-92-5-108992-7|url=http://www.fao.org/3/a-i5174e.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gender studies''' is a [[Field of study|field]] for [[Interdisciplinarity|interdisciplinary]] study devoted to [[gender identity]] and gendered [[Representation (politics)|representation]] as central categories of analysis. This field includes [[women's studies]] (concerning [[women]], [[feminism]], gender, and politics), [[men's studies]] and [[queer studies]].&lt;ref name="whitman"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.whitman.edu/content/genderstudies |title=Gender Studies |publisher=Whitman College |accessdate=May 1, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20121212181127/http://www.whitman.edu/content/genderstudies |archivedate=12 December 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes, gender studies is offered together with study of [[Human sexuality|sexuality]].

These disciplines study [[gender]] and sexuality in the fields of [[literature]], language, [[geography]], [[history]], [[political science]], [[sociology]], [[anthropology]], [[Film theory|cinema]], [[media studies]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Gender And Media: Representing, Producing, Consuming |last1=Krijnen |first1=Tonny |last2=van Bauwel |first2=Sofie |publisher=Routledge |year=2015 |isbn=978-0-415-69540-4 |location=New York |pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; human development, law, public health and medicine.&lt;ref name="uchicago"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://gendersexuality.uchicago.edu/about/ | title=About – Center for the Study of Gender and Sexuality (CSGS) | publisher=[[The University of Chicago]] | accessdate=May 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also analyzes how [[Race (human classification)|race]], [[ethnicity]], [[Location (geography)|location]], [[Class (social)|class]], [[nationality]], and [[disability]] intersect with the categories of gender and sexuality.&lt;ref name="Race, Ethnicity, Gender &amp; Class"&gt;Healey, J. F. (2003). ''Race, Ethnicity, Gender and Class: the Sociology of Group Conflict and Change''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="indiana"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.indiana.edu/~gender/ | title=Department of Gender Studies | publisher=[[Indiana University]] (IU Bloomington) | accessdate=May 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Regarding gender, [[Simone de Beauvoir]] said: "One is not born a woman, one becomes one."&lt;ref name="de Beauvoir"&gt;de Beauvoir, S. (1949, 1989). "The Second Sex".&lt;/ref&gt; This view proposes that in gender studies, the term "gender" should be used to refer to the [[social constructionism|social and cultural constructions]] of masculinities and femininities and not to the state of being male or female in its entirety.&lt;ref name="Stephanie Garrett"&gt;Garrett, S. (1992). "Gender", p. vii.&lt;/ref&gt; However, this view is not held by all gender theorists. Beauvoir's is a view that many sociologists support (see [[Sociology of gender]]), though there are many other contributors to the field of gender studies with different backgrounds and opposing views, such as psychoanalyst [[Jacques Lacan#Lacan and his discontents|Jacques Lacan]] and feminists such as [[Judith Butler]].

Gender is pertinent to many disciplines, such as [[literary theory]], drama studies, [[film theory]], [[performativity|performance theory]], contemporary [[art history]], anthropology, sociology, [[sociolinguistics]] and [[psychology]]. However, these disciplines sometimes differ in their approaches to how and why gender is studied. For instance in anthropology, sociology and psychology, gender is often studied as a practice, whereas in cultural studies representations of gender are more often examined. In politics, gender can be viewed as a foundational discourse that political actors employ in order to position themselves on a variety of issues.&lt;ref&gt;Salime, Zakia. ''Between Feminism and Islam: Human Rights and Sharia Law in Morocco''. Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Gender studies is also a discipline in itself, incorporating methods and approaches from a wide range of disciplines.&lt;ref name=companion&gt;{{cite book |last1=Essed |first1=Philomena |authorlink1=Philomena Essed |last2=Goldberg |first2=David Theo |authorlink2=David Theo Goldberg |last3=Kobayashi |first3=Audrey |authorlink3=Audrey Kobayashi |title=A Companion to Gender Studies |publisher=Wiley-Blackwell |year=2009 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=ZPgYDTa9P84C |accessdate=7 November 2011 |isbn=978-1-4051-8808-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each field came to regard "gender" as a practice, sometimes referred to as something that is [[Performative utterance|performative]].&lt;ref name = "performativity of gender"/&gt; [[Feminist theory]] of psychoanalysis, articulated mainly by [[Julia Kristeva]]&lt;ref&gt;Anne-Marie Smith, ''Julia Kristeva: Speaking the Unspeakable'' (Pluto Press, 1988).&lt;/ref&gt; (the "semiotic" and "abjection") and [[Bracha L.

According to Sam Killermann, Gender can also be broken into three categories, gender identity, gender expression, and biological sex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRcPXtqdKjE|title=Understanding the Complexities of Gender: Sam Killermann at TEDxUofIChicago|date=3 May 2013|work=YouTube|accessdate=26 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; These three categories are another way of breaking down gender into the different social, biological, and cultural constructions. These constructions focus on how femininity and masculinity are fluid entities and how their meaning is able to fluctuate depending on the various constraints surrounding them.

==Influences==

===Psychoanalytic theory===

A number of theorists have influenced the field of gender studies significantly, specifically in terms of psychoanalytic theory. Among these are [[Sigmund Freud]], [[Jacques Lacan]], [[Julia Kristeva]], [[Bracha L. Ettinger]], and Mark Blechner.

Gender studied under the lens of each of these theorists looks somewhat different. In a Freudian system, women are "mutilated and must learn to accept their lack of a penis" (in Freud's terms a "deformity").&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Horney | first = Karen | contribution = On the Genesis of the Castration Complex in Women (1922) | editor-last = Miller | editor-first = J. B. | title = Psychoanalysis and Women | location = New York | publisher = Bruner/Mazel | year = 1973 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lacan, however, organizes femininity and masculinity according to different unconscious structures. Both male and female subjects participate in the "phallic" organization, and the feminine side of sexuation is "supplementary" and not opposite or complementary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Lacan | first = Jacques | author-link = Jacques Lacan | title = Encore | publisher = Seuil | location = Paris | year = 1975}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of sexuation (sexual situation), which posits the development of gender-roles and role-play in childhood, is useful in countering the idea that gender identity is innate or biologically determined. In other words, the sexuation of an individual has as much, if not more, to do with their development of a gender identity as being genetically sexed male or female.&lt;ref name="Lacan &amp; Post-feminism"&gt;{{cite book | last = Wright | first = E. | title = Lacan and Postfeminism (Postmodern Encounters) | year = 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!--Other influences include [[Julia Kristeva]] and [[Mark Blechner]]. --&gt;Julia Kristeva has significantly developed the field of [[semiotics]]. She contends that patriarchal cultures, like individuals, have to exclude the maternal and the feminine so that they can come into being.&lt;ref name="Kristeva Abject"&gt;{{cite book | last = Kristeva | first = Julia | author-link = Julia Kristeva | title = Powers of Horror | year = 1982 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mark Blechner expanded psychoanalytic views of sex and gender.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Blechner | first = Mark J. | author-link = Mark Blechner| title = Sex Changes: Transformations in Society and Psychoanalysis | location = New York and London | publisher = Taylor &amp; Francis | year = 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He has argued that there is a "gender fetish" in western society, in which the gender of sexual partners is given enormously disproportionate attention over other factors involved in sexual attraction, such as age and social class.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Blechner | first = Mark J. | author-link = Mark Blechner | contribution = The shaping of psychoanalytic theory and practice by cultural and personal biases about sexuality | editor-last1 = Domenici | editor-first1 = T. | editor-last2 = Lesser | editor-first2 = R. | title = Disorienting Sexuality | pages = 265–288 | publisher = Routledge | location = New York | year = 1995 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bracha L. Ettinger]] transformed subjectivity in contemporary psychoanalysis since the early 1990s with the Matrixial&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Ettinger | first = Bracha L. | author-link = Bracha L.

Ettinger rethinks the human subject as informed by the archaic connectivity to the maternal and proposes the idea of a Demeter-Persephone Complexity.&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|mdkbYsjlMA8|Public lecture at EGS (2012)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cultures can have very different norms of maleness and [[masculinity]]. Blechner identifies the terror, in Western males, of penetration. Yet in many societies, being gay is defined only by being a male who lets himself be penetrated. Males who penetrate other males are considered masculine and not gay and are not the targets of prejudice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Blechner | first = Mark J. | author-link = Mark Blechner | title = Maleness and masculinity | journal = [[Contemporary Psychoanalysis]] | volume = 34 | issue = 4 | pages = 597–613 | doi = 10.1080/00107530.1998.10747024 | date = 1998 | ref = harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other cultures, however, receptive [[fellatio]] is the norm for early adolescence and seen as a requirement for developing normal manliness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Herdt | first = G. | title = Guardians of the Flute | location = New York | publisher = McGraw-Hill | year = 1981}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Feminist psychoanalytic theory====
Feminist theorists such as [[Juliet Mitchell]], [[Nancy Chodorow]], [[Jessica Benjamin]], [[Jane Gallop]], Bracha L. Ettinger, [[Shoshana Felman]], [[Griselda Pollock]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Pollock | first = Griselda | author-link = Griselda Pollock | title = Encounters in the Virtual Feminist Museum: Time, Space and the Archive | publisher = Routledge | date = 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Luce Irigaray]] and Jane Flax have developed a Feminist psychoanalysis and argued that psychoanalytic theory is vital to the feminist project and must, like other theoretical traditions, be criticized by women as well as transformed to free it from vestiges of sexism (i.e. being [[censored]]). [[Shulamith Firestone]], in "The Dialectic of Sex" calls Freudianism the misguided feminism and discusses how Freudianism is ''almost'' completely accurate, with the exception of one crucial detail: everywhere that Freud writes "penis", the word should be replaced with "power".

Critics such as [[Elizabeth Grosz]] accuse [[Jacques Lacan]] of maintaining a sexist tradition in psychoanalysis.&lt;ref name ="Grosz"&gt;{{cite book | last = Grosz | first = Elizabeth | author-link = Elizabeth Grosz| title = Jacques Lacan: A Feminist Introduction | location = London | publisher = Routledge | year = 1990 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Others, such as [[Judith Butler]], Bracha L. Ettinger and [[Jane Gallop]] have used Lacanian work, though in a critical way, to develop gender theory.&lt;ref name="Gender Trouble"&gt;{{cite book | last = Butler | first = Judith | author-link = Judith Butler | title = Gender Trouble: Feminism and the Subversion of Identity | title-link = Gender Trouble | year = 1999 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ettinger"&gt;{{citation | last = Ettinger | first = Bracha L. | author-link = Bracha L.

According to J. B. Marchand, "The gender studies and queer theory are rather reluctant, hostile to see the psychoanalytic approach."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last1 = Chaudoye | first1 = Guillemine | last2 = Cupa | first2 = Dominique | last3 = Parat | first3 = Hélène | contribution = Judith Butler | editor-last1 = Chaudoye | editor-first1 = Guillemine | editor-last2 = Cupa | editor-first2 = Dominique | editor-last3 = Parat | editor-first3 = Hélène | title = Le Sexuel, ses différences et ses genres | publisher = EDK Editions | location = Paris | year = 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For [[Jean-Claude Guillebaud]], gender studies (and activists of sexual minorities) "besieged" and consider psychoanalysis and psychoanalysts as "the new priests, the last defenders of the genital normality, morality, moralism or even obscurantism".&lt;ref&gt;[[Jean-Claude Guillebaud]], Armand Abécassis, Alain Houziaux, ''La psychanalyse peut-elle guérir?'' Paris: Éditions de l'Atelier, 2005, p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Judith Butler]]'s worries about the psychoanalytic outlook under which sexual difference is "undeniable" and pathologizing any effort to suggest that it is not so paramount and unambiguous ...".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Butler | first1 = Judith | last2 = Fassin | first2 = Éric | last3 = Wallach Scott | first3 = Joan | author-link1 = Judith Butler | author-link2 = Éric Fassin | author-link3 = Joan Wallach Scott | title = Pour ne pas en finir avec le 'genre'... table ronde | trans-title = For more on 'gender'... round table | journal = Sociétés &amp; Représentations, Special Issue: Investigating Gender | volume = 2 | issue = 24 | pages = 285–306 | doi = 10.3917/sr.024.0285 | date = May 2006 | ref = harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Daniel Beaune and Caterina Rea, the gender-studies "often criticized psychoanalysis to perpetuate a family and social model of patriarchal, based on a rigid and timeless version of the parental order".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Beaune | first1 = Daniel | last2 = Rea | first2 = Caterina | title = Psychanalyse sans Œdipe: Antigone, genre et subversion | page = 78 | publisher = L'Harmattan | location = Paris | year = 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Literary theory===
Psychoanalytically oriented French feminism focused on visual and literary theory all along. [[Virginia Woolf]]'s legacy as well as "[[Adrienne Rich]]'s call for women's revisions of literary texts, and history as well, has galvanized a generation of feminist authors to reply with texts of their own".&lt;ref&gt;Mica Howe &amp; Sarah A. Aguier (eds). ''He said, She Says''. Fairleigh Dickinson University Press, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Griselda Pollock]] and other feminists have articulated Myth and poetry&lt;ref name="Vanda Zajko 2006"&gt;Vanda Zajko &amp; [[Miriam Leonard]] (eds). ''Laughing with Medusa''. Oxford University Press, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; and literature,&lt;ref name="Vanda Zajko 2006"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Humm, Maggie, ''Modernist Women and Visual Cultures''.

Stanford University Press, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; from the point of view of gender.

===Post-modern influence===
The emergence of [[post-modernism]] theories affected gender studies,&lt;ref name="Lacan &amp; Post-feminism"/&gt; causing a movement in [[Gender identity|identity theories]] away from the concept of fixed or [[essentialism|essentialist]] gender identity, to [[Postmodernity#Distinctions in philosophy and critical theory|post-modern]]&lt;ref&gt;Grebowicz, M. (2007). ''Gender After Lyotard''. NY: SUNY Press, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; fluid&lt;ref&gt;Zohar, Ayelet (ed.), ''PostGender''. Cambridge Scholars Publishing, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; or multiple identities.&lt;ref&gt;Benhabib, S. (1995). "Feminist Contentions: A Philosophical Exchange", and Butler, J. (1995), "Feminist Contentions: A Philosophical Exchange".&lt;/ref&gt; The impact of post-structuralism, and its literary theory aspect post-modernism, on gender studies was most prominent in its challenging of grand narratives. Post-structuralism paved the way for the emergence of [[queer theory]] in gender studies, which necessitated the field expanding its purview to sexuality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://genderandsexuality.as.nyu.edu/page/home|title=Gender and Sexuality Studies – New York University|work=nyu.edu|accessdate=26 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the expansion to include sexuality studies, under the influence of post-modernism gender studies has also turned its lens toward [[hegemonic masculinity|masculinity studies]], due to the work of sociologists and theorists such as [[R. W. Connell]], [[Michael Kimmel]], and E. Anthony Rotundo.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=American Manhood: Transformations In Masculinity From The Revolution To The Modern Era|author= E. Anthony Rotundo|isbn= 9780465001699|date= 1994-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Reeser, ''Masculinities in Theory'', 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

These changes and expansions have led to some contentions within the field, such as the one between second wave feminists and queer theorists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://amygoodloe.com/papers/lesbian-feminism-and-queer-theory-another-battle-of-the-sexes/|title=Lesbian-Feminism and Queer Theory: Another "Battle of the Sexes"?|work=amygoodloe.com|accessdate=26 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The line drawn between these two camps lies in the problem as feminists see it of queer theorists arguing that everything is fragmented and there are not only no grand narratives but also no trends or categories. Feminists argue that this erases the categories of gender altogether but does nothing to antagonize the power dynamics reified by gender. In other words, the fact that gender is [[social construction|socially constructed]] does not undo the fact that there are strata of oppression between genders.

==Development of theory==

===History===

The history of gender studies looks at the different perspectives of gender. This discipline examines the ways in which historical, cultural, and social events shape the role of gender in different societies. The field of gender studies, while focusing on the differences between men and women, also looks at sexual differences and less binary definitions of gender categorization.&lt;ref&gt;"Gender: A Useful Category of Historical Analysis," American Historical Review 91, No. 5 (December 1986).&lt;/ref&gt;

After the universal suffrage revolution of the twentieth century, the [[women's liberation movement]] of the 1960 and 1970s promoted a revision from the feminists to "actively interrogate" the usual and accepted versions of history as it was known at the time. It was the goal of many feminist scholars to question original assumptions regarding women's and men's attributes, to actually measure them, and to report observed differences between women and men.&lt;ref name="Chafetz, Janet Saltzman 1999"&gt;Chafetz, Janet Saltzman. Handbook of the Sociology of Gender. New York: Kluwer Academic/Plenum, 1999. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, these programs were essentially feminist, designed to recognize contributions made by women as well as by men. Soon, men began to look at masculinity the same way that women were looking at femininity, and developed an area of study called "men's studies".&lt;ref name="Douglas, Fedwa 2007"&gt;Douglas, Fedwa. ''Encyclopedia of Sex and Gender''. Detroit: Macmillan Reference, 2007. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; It was not until the late 1980s and 1990s that scholars recognized a need for study in the field of sexuality. This was due to the increasing interest in lesbian and gay rights, and scholars found that most individuals will associate sexuality and gender together, rather than as separate entities.&lt;ref name="Douglas, Fedwa 2007"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Liddington|first=Jill|title=HISTORY, FEMINISM AND GENDER STUDIES|url=http://www.jliddington.org.uk/cig1.html|publisher=University of Leeds Centre for Interdisciplinary Gender Studies: Working Paper 1 Feminist Scholarship: within/across/between/beyond the disciplines}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study of drivers' propensity to use traffic information system showed that income and car ownership play an important role in travel behavior for men, while education and occupation were identified significant in the women's behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40890-015-0002-5#page-1 |title=Investigating Women's and Men's Propensity to Use Traffic Information in a Developing Country |author=Fatemeh Baratian-Ghorghi|author2= Huaguo Zhou |year=2015 |work=Transportation in Developing Economies |accessdate=27 June 2015|doi=10.1007/s40890-015-0002-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although doctoral programs for women's studies have existed since 1990, the first doctoral program for a potential PhD in gender studies in the United States was approved in November 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2005/11/10/gender |title=Indiana Creates First Gender Studies PhD |date=10 November 2005 |first=Scott |last=Jaschik |quote=The last decade has seen the number of women's studies PhD programs grow to at least 10 – most of them relatively new.

In 2015, [[Kabul University]] became the first university in Afghanistan to offer a master's degree course in gender and women's studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=FaithWorld |url=http://blogs.reuters.com/faithworld/2015/10/26/kabul-university-unlikely-host-for-first-afghan-womens-studies-programme/ |title=Kabul University unlikely host for first Afghan women's studies programme |publisher=Blogs.reuters.com |date=26 October 2015 |accessdate=2 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Women's studies===
{{Main|Women's studies}}
Women's studies is an [[interdisciplinary]] [[List of academic disciplines|academic field]] devoted to topics concerning [[women]], [[feminism]], [[gender identity|gender]], and [[politics]]. It often includes [[feminist theory]], [[women's history]] (e.g. a history of [[women's suffrage]]) and [[social history]], [[women's fiction]], [[women's health]], feminist psychoanalysis and the [[feminist]] and gender studies-influenced practice of most of the [[humanities]] and [[social sciences]].

===Men's studies===
{{Main|Men's studies}}
Men's studies is an [[interdisciplinary]] [[List of academic disciplines|academic field]] devoted to topics concerning [[men]], [[masculism]], [[gender identity|gender]], and [[politics]]. It often includes feminist theory, men's history and [[social history]], men's fiction, [[men's health]], feminist psychoanalysis and the feminist and gender studies-influenced practice of most of the [[humanities]] and [[social sciences]]. Timothy Laurie and Anna Hickey-Moody suggest that there 'have always been dangers present in the institutionalisation of "masculinity studies" as a semi-gated community', and note that 'a certain triumphalism vis-à-vis feminist philosophy haunts much masculinities research'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Laurie |first1=Timothy |last2=Hickey-Moody |first2=Anna |year=2015 |title=Geophilosophies of Masculinity: Remapping Gender, Aesthetics and Knowledge |url=https://www.academia.edu/10912564 |format=PDF |journal=Angelaki: Journal of the Theoretical Humanities |volume=20 |issue=1 |pages=1–10 |doi=10.1080/0969725X.2015.1017359}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gender in Asia===
{{See also|Women in Asia}}

Certain issues associated with gender in [[Eastern Asia]] and the [[Pacific Region]] are more complex and depend on location and context. For example, in [[China]], [[Vietnam]], [[Thailand]], [[Philippines]] and [[Indonesia]], a heavy importance of what defines a woman comes from the workforce. In these countries, "gender related challenges tend to be related to economic empowerment, employment, and workplace issues, for example related to informal sector workers, feminization of migration flows, work place conditions, and long term social security".&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;The World Bank. [http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/COUNTRIES/EASTASIAPACIFICEXT/EXTEAPREGTOPSOCDEV/0,,contentMDK:20327365~menuPK:502969~pagePK:34004173~piPK:34003707~theSitePK:502940,00.html "Gender in East Asia and Pacific"], Social Development. The World Bank, 2013. Web. March 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; However, in countries who are less economically stable, such as [[Papua New Guinea]], [[Timor Leste]], [[Laos]], [[Cambodia]], and some provinces in more remote locations, "women tend to bear the cost of social and domestic conflicts and natural disasters".&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

One issue that remains consistent throughout all provinces in different stages of development is women having a weak voice when it comes to decision-making. One of the reasons for this is the "growing trend to decentralization [which] has moved decision-making down to levels at which women's voice is often weakest and where even the women's civil society movement, which has been a powerful advocate at national level, struggles to organize and be heard".&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

East Asia Pacific's approach to help mainstream these issues of gender relies on a three-pillar method.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/COUNTRIES/EASTASIAPACIFICEXT/EXTEAPREGTOPSOCDEV/0,,contentMDK:20327365~menuPK:502969~pagePK:34004173~piPK:34003707~theSitePK:502940,00.html#EAP_approach | website = The World Bank | title = Gender in East Asia and Pacific}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pillar one is partnering with middle-income countries and emerging middle-income countries to sustain and share gains in growth and prosperity. Pillar two supports the developmental underpinnings for peace, renewed growth and poverty reduction in the poorest and most fragile areas. The final pillar provides a stage for knowledge management, exchange and dissemination on gender responsive development within the region to begin. These programs have already been established, and successful in, [[Vietnam]], [[Thailand]], [[China]], as well as the [[Philippines]], and efforts are starting to be made in [[Laos]], [[Papua New Guinea]], and [[Timor Leste]] as well. These pillars speak to the importance of showcasing gender studies.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

===Judith Butler===
{{Main|Judith Butler}}

The concept of gender performativity is at the core of philosopher and gender theorist Judith Butler's work ''[[Gender Trouble]]''. In Butler's terms the performance of gender, sex, and sexuality is about power in society.&lt;ref name="performativity of gender"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Butler | first = Judith | author-link = Judith Butler | title = Gender Trouble: Feminism and the Subversion of Identity | title-link = Gender Trouble | year = 1999 | page = 9}}&lt;/ref&gt; She locates the [[Social constructivism|construction]] of the "gendered, sexed, desiring subject" in "regulative discourses". A part of Butler's argument concerns the role of sex in the construction of "natural" or coherent gender and sexuality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UczySqq19AIC|title=Bodies That Matter: On the Discursive Limits of Sex|last=Butler|first=Judith|authorlink=Judith Butler|year=2011|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=9781136807183|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In her account, gender and heterosexuality are constructed as natural because the opposition of the male and female sexes is perceived as natural in the social imaginary.&lt;ref name="performativity of gender"&gt;{{cite book | last = Butler | first = Judith | author-link = Judith Butler | title = Gender Trouble: Feminism and the Subversion of Identity | title-link = Gender Trouble | year = 1999 | pages = 163–71, 177–8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticisms==
Historian and theorist Bryan Palmer argues that gender studies' current reliance on [[post-structuralism]] – with its reification of discourse and avoidance of the structures of oppression and struggles of resistance – obscures the origins, meanings, and consequences of historical events and processes, and he seeks to counter current trends in gender studies with an argument for the necessity to analyze lived experiences and the structures of subordination and power.&lt;ref&gt;Bryan Palmer, "Descent into Discourse: The Reification of Language and the Writing of Social History", Trent University (Peterborough, Canada)&lt;/ref&gt;
Authors Daphne Patai and Noretta Koertge propose in the book ''Professing Feminism: Education and Indoctrination in Women's Studies'' that the attempt to make women's studies serve a political agenda has led to problematic results such as dubious scholarship and pedagogical practices that resemble indoctrination more than education.

[[Rosi Braidotti]] (1994) has criticized gender studies as "the take-over of the feminist agenda by studies on masculinity, which results in transferring funding from feminist faculty positions to other kinds of positions. There have been cases... of positions advertised as 'gender studies' being given away to the 'bright boys'. Some of the competitive take-over has to do with gay studies. Of special significance in this discussion is the role of the mainstream publisher Routledge who, in our opinion, is responsible for promoting gender as a way of deradicalizing the feminist agenda, re-marketing masculinity and gay male identity instead."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Butler | first = Judith | author-link = Judith Butler | title = Feminism by any other name (Judith Butler interviews Rosi Braidotti) | journal = [[Differences (journal)|differences: A Journal of Feminist Cultural Studies]] | volume = 6 | issue = 2–3 | pages = 44–45 | date = Summer 1994 | url = https://bagelabyss.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/butler-and-braidotti-interview-feminism-by-any-other-name1.pdf | format = pdf | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; Calvin Thomas countered that, "as Joseph Allen Boone points out, 'many of the men in the academy who are feminism's most supportive 'allies' ''are'' gay,'" and that it is "disingenuous" to ignore the ways in which mainstream publishers such as Routledge have promoted feminist theorists.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, Calvin, ed., "Introduction: Identification, Appropriation, Proliferation", ''Straight with a Twist: Queer Theory and the Subject of Heterosexuality''. University of Illinois Press, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gender studies, and more particularly queer studies within gender studies, were repeatedly criticized by the Vatican. Pope Francis spoke about "ideological colonization",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=John |last=Newsome |title=Pope warns of 'ideological colonization' in transgender teachings |work=CNN |date=October 4, 2016 |url=http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/02/world/pope-transgender-comments/}}&lt;/ref&gt; by which he meant that "gender ideology" threatens traditional family and fertile heterosexuality. France was one of the first countries where this claim became widespread when Catholic movements marched in the streets of Paris against the bill on gay marriage and adoption. [[Bruno Perreau]] has shown that this fear has deep historical roots.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bruno Perreau]], ''[http://www.sup.org/books/title/?id=27481 Queer Theory: The French Response]'', Stanford University Press, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; He argues that the rejection of gender studies and queer theory expresses anxieties about national identity and minority politics.

Teaching certain aspects of gender theory was banned in public schools [[New South Wales]] after an independent review into how the state teaches sex and health education and the controversial material included in the teaching materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Urban|first1=Rebecca|title=Gender theory banned in NSW classrooms|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/national-affairs/education/gender-theory-banned-in-nsw-classrooms/news-story/eeb40f3264394798ebe67260fa2f5782|accessdate=2 November 2017|work=[[The Australian]]|date=February 9, 2017|archive-url=https://archive.is/5TEdW|archive-date=2017-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== State and governmental attitudes to gender studies ===
In Central and Eastern Europe ‘anti-gender’ movements are on the rise, especially, in Hungary, Poland, and Russia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/the-conversation-global/how-hungary-and-poland-ha_b_12486148.html|title=How Hungary and Poland have silenced women and stifled human rights|last=Global|first=The Conversation|date=2016-10-14|website=Huffington Post|language=en-US|access-date=2018-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=|title=Anti-Gender Movements on the Rise?|url=https://pl.boell.org/sites/default/files/anti-gender-movements-on-the-rise.pdf|journal=Publication Series on Democracy|volume=38|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Russia ====
In Russia gender studies are at the moment tolerated, however state support practices that pushes gender agenda related to perspectives on gender of those in power – e.g. law solving in detail specifics of domestic violence was abolished in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://foreignpolicy.com/2018/04/09/putins-war-on-women/|title=Putin's War on Women|last=Ferris-Rotman|first=Amie|website=Foreign Policy|language=en|access-date=2018-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2010 the Russia has also been leading a campaign at the [[United Nations Human Rights Council|UNHRC]] to recognise so-called ‘traditional values’ as a legitimate consideration in human rights protection and promotion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/gender/2018/01/15/traditional-values-for-the-99-the-new-gender-ideology-in-russia/|title=‘Traditional values’ for the 99%?

==== Hungary ====
Gender studies programs were banned in Hungary in October 2018. In a statement released by Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban's office, a spokesperson stated that "The government's standpoint is that people are born either male or female, and we do not consider it acceptable for us to talk about socially constructed genders rather than biological sexes." The ban has attracted criticism from several European universities which offer the program, among them the Budapest-based Central European University, whose charter was revoked by the government, and is widely seen as part of the Hungarian ruling party's move towards totalitarianism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/hungary-bans-gender-studies-programmes-viktor-orban-central-european-university-budapest-a8599796.html|title=Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban bans gender studies programmes|last=Oppenheim|first=Maya|date=2018-10-24|work=The Independent|access-date=2018-10-17|language=en-UK}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== China ====
[[Central People's Government|The Central People's Government]] supports studies of gender and social development of gender in history and practices that lead to gender equality. Citing [[Mao Zedong]]'s philosophy, "Women hold up half the sky", this may be seen as continuation of equality of men and women introduced as part of [[Cultural Revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/may/20/china-voices-lu-ying|title=China voices: the professor of gender studies|last=Branigan|first=Tania|date=2009-05-20|newspaper=The Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3026">[[Image:Chenal-beautemps.jpg|right|thumb|Grassed waterway in [[Velm]], Belgium, during a sunny day]]
A '''grassed waterway''' consists in a {{convert|2|m|ft|sing=on}} to 48-metre-wide (157 ft) native [[grassland]] strip of [[green belt]]. It is generally installed in the [[thalweg]], the deepest continuous line along a [[valley]] or [[watercourse]], of a cultivated dry valley in order to control [[erosion]]. A study carried out on a grassed waterway during 8 years in [[Bavaria]] showed that it can lead to several other types of positive impacts, e.g. on [[biodiversity]].&lt;ref&gt;Fiener P., Auerswald K. (2003). Concept and effects of a multi-purpose grassed waterway. Soil Use and Management 19, 65-72.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Distinctions==

Confusion between "grassed waterway" and "vegetative filter strips" should be avoided. The latter are generally narrower (only a few metres wide) and rather installed along rivers as well as along or within cultivated fields. However, [[buffer strip]] can be a [[synonym]], with shrubs and trees added to the plant component, as does a [[riparian zone]].

== Runoff and erosion mitigation ==
[[Image:Chenal-mauvaistemps.jpg|right|thumb|Grassed waterway in Velm, Belgium, after a thunderstorm]]
[[Surface runoff|Runoff]] generated on cropland during storms or long winter rains concentrates in the [[thalweg]] where it can lead to rill or [[gully]] erosion.   

Rills and gullies further concentrate runoff and speed up its transfer, which can worsen damage occurring downstream. This can result in a [[muddy flood]]. 

In this context, a grassed waterway allows increasing soil cohesion and roughness. It also prevents the formation of rills and gullies. Furthermore, it can slow down runoff and allow its re-infiltration during long winter rains. In contrast, its infiltration capacity is generally not sufficient to reinfiltrate runoff produced by heavy spring and summer storms. It can therefore be useful to combine it with extra measures, like the installation of earthen dams across the grassed waterway, in order to buffer runoff temporarily.&lt;ref&gt;Evrard, O., Vandaele, K., van Wesemael, B., Bielders, C.L, 2008. A grassed waterway and earthen dams to control muddy floods from a cultivated catchment of the Belgian loess belt. Geomorphology  100, 419-428.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6675">The '''Gwyneddigion Society''' ({{lang-cy|'''Cymdeithas y Gwyneddigion'''}}) was a [[London]]-based [[Wales|Welsh]] literary and cultural society. The original society was founded in 1770 and wound up in 1843. It was briefly revived in 1978. Its proceedings were conducted through the medium of [[Welsh language|Welsh]].

==History==
The Gwyneddigion Society was founded in December 1770 by a group of expatriate Welshmen resident in London, its first formal meeting taking place on 4 February 1771. Foremost of the founders was [[Owen Jones (antiquary)|Owen Jones]] (known as Owain Myfyr), who became the society's first President. Originally from [[Llanfihangel Glyn Myfyr]], Jones had moved to London as a young man and had earned his fortune as a furrier.&lt;ref&gt;Davies 2008, p. 429.&lt;/ref&gt; Other notable early members included [[Iolo Morganwg]] (Edward Williams), [[William Owen Pughe]], [[John Jones (Jac Glan-y-gors)|Jac Glan-y-gors]] (John Jones), [[John Edwards (1747–1792)|Siôn Ceiriog]] (John Edwards), [[Edward Jones (harpist)|Edward Jones]] ("Bardd y Brenin"), and [[Twm o'r Nant]] (Thomas Edwards). Although the society's name (meaning "Gwynedd scholars") suggests a particular link with the region of [[Gwynedd]], its affiliations were from the start with the whole of [[North Wales]], and later with all parts of Wales.&lt;ref&gt;Leathart 1831, pp. 11–12.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Davies 346"&gt;Davies 2008, p. 346.&lt;/ref&gt; 

It seems likely that the society was formed in part in reaction to the perceived social and intellectual elitism of the existing London Welsh societies, notably the [[Honourable Society of Cymmrodorion]] (although there was in practice considerable overlap between the membership and the officials of the various societies). The emphasis in the early years was on sociability, music (including [[harp]]-playing and [[Cerdd Dant|penillion-singing]]), and pleasure.&lt;ref&gt;Jones 2001, p. 75.&lt;/ref&gt; The society's principal meeting-place was the Bull's Head Tavern in [[Walbrook]], and one member, [[David Samwell]], wrote:
:In Walbrook stands a famous Inn
:Near ancient Watling Street
:Well stored with brandy, beer and gin,
:Where Cambrians nightly meet.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Jenkins and Ramage 1951, p. 115.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Under rules adopted in 1777, every member had to be Welsh-speaking, and had to avow a fondness for singing, or at least for hearing poetry sung to the harp.&lt;ref&gt;Jenkins and Ramage 1951, p. 112.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the society rapidly adopted a more broadly cultural, and specifically a literary, role. When the Cymmrodorion Society was dissolved in 1787, its Presidential Chair was passed to the Gwyneddigion Society.&lt;ref&gt;Jenkins and Ramage 1951, p. 119.&lt;/ref&gt; One member described the Bull's Head between 1790 and 1815 as the "centre of Welsh literary life" ("''canolfan bywyd llenyddol ein gwlad''").&lt;ref&gt;Jones 2001, p. 76.&lt;/ref&gt;

The society promoted annual [[eisteddfod]]au in Wales, the precursors of the [[National Eisteddfod of Wales|National Eisteddfod]] (the first being held at [[Bala, Gwynedd|Bala]] in 1789); but these experienced difficulties, and the experiment was abandoned after 1793.&lt;ref&gt;Jenkins and Ramage 1951, pp. 123–7.&lt;/ref&gt; It had its own library, and maintained contact with scholars across Wales, such as [[William Jones (Welsh radical)|William Jones]], to aid them in their knowledge gathering. It also offered an annual prize for literature, in the form of a silver medal. Most significantly, the society (with the financial backing of Owen Jones) published important Welsh literary texts, including ''Barddoniaeth Dafydd ab Gwilym'' (1789) and ''[[The Myvyrian Archaiology of Wales]]'' (1801–07).&lt;ref name="Davies 346"/&gt;

A noteworthy event in the society's early history was its funding in the 1790s of [[John Evans (explorer)|John Evans]]' exploration of North America in search of the legendary "Welsh Indians", the supposed descendants of [[Madoc|Madog ab Owain Gwynedd]].&lt;ref name="Davies 346"/&gt;

From the beginning of the 19th century the society began a slow decline, and by the mid-1830s it had been effectively subsumed into the [[Cymreigyddion Society]] (founded in 1795). It was formally dissolved in 1843.&lt;ref&gt;Jenkins and Ramage 1951, pp. 127–8.&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Revival==
A new Gwyneddigion Society was formed in London in 1978, but it is not known to have survived.&lt;ref name="Davies 346"/&gt;

'''''Harry Clarke{{spaced ndash}}Darkness in Light '''''is a documentary film originally released in 2003 (Irish-language version titled Harry Clarke - Dorchadas i Solas).

==Synopsis==
Filmmaker [[John J Doherty]] traces the life and work of the [[Irish people|Irish]] artist, book illustrator and [[stained glass]] artist [[Harry Clarke]] (1889–1931) with major contributions from his biographer [[Nicola Gordon Bowe]] as well as many stained glass artists, poets and historians. The film takes the artist's work in [[stained glass]], which was mainly religious an ethereal, and in [[book illustration]], which was mainly dark &amp; fantastical, as the basis for its title and tells a story of talent, struggle, success and the [[censorship]] of his final masterpiece 'the Geneva Window'. [[Harry Clarke]] brought his expertise in working in fine decorative detail in glass to his book illustrations, most notably in the tales of [[Hans Christian Andersen]] and [[Edgar Allan Poe]] where he is compared to [[Aubrey Beardsley]] and which are featured in the film and paralleled with [[German Expressionist]] cinema of the time. The film was made in conjunction with the [[Irish Film Board]] and national broadcaster [[TG4]].

==Awards==
This film won the Best Arts Documentary award at the 2004 [[Celtic International Film Festival]].&lt;br /&gt;

The '''Hasmonean royal winter palaces''' are a complex of Hasmonean and Herodian buildings from the [[Second Temple]] period, which were discovered in the western plain of [[Jericho]] valley, at '''Tulul Abu al-'Alayiq''', near the place where the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] road connecting Jericho with [[Jerusalem]] enters [[Wadi Qelt]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/History/Early%20History%20-%20Archaeology/Jericho%20-%20The%20Winter%20Palace%20of%20King%20Herod Jericho - The Winter Palace of King Herod]&lt;/ref&gt; Two [[Tell (archaeology)|tells]] are located on either side of Wadi Qelt.

The [[palaces]] are evidence of the luxurious lifestyle of the [[Hasmonean]] dynasty and of [[Herod the Great]]. They made extensive use of [[swimming pools]], [[Public bathing|bathhouses]], ornamental gardens and orchards. The palaces were not far from Jerusalem – 20&amp;nbsp;km along the ancient [[Roman roads|Roman road]].

== History of excavations ==
[[File:Roman_aqueduct_near_Jericho,_Eretz_Israel,_edited.jpg|thumb|Roman aqueduct near Jericho]]
The site was excavated in the 19th century by [[Charles Warren]], who attempted to locate the place of Biblical Jericho. After making an archaeological trench, he concluded that this site is from the Roman period. Additional excavations were conducted by the Germans [[Ernst Sellin]] and [[Carl Watzinger]], in 1910–1911, but the results have never been published. In 1950, two expeditions from the United States dug on the site. An ornamental garden with magnificent remains from the time of Herod was discovered north of the southern tell, and labeled "the sunken garden."&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.il/books?id=hXHDCAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA102&amp;lpg=PA102&amp;dq=hasmonean+winter+palaces&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=W82weO1Whh&amp;sig=lxvb4HwcvT117MeRYlISIuIyg0U&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj1zLS-uNrSAhUBBsAKHfBUAJA4ChDoAQgaMAE#v=onepage&amp;q=hasmonean%20winter%20palaces&amp;f=true Herod's Judaea: A Mediterranean State in the Classic World, Samuel Rocca]&lt;/ref&gt; Farther north were discovered the remains of a building, identified as a gymnasium.

After the [[Yom Kippur War]] in 1973, extensive excavations were conducted on site by [[archaeologist]] [[Ehud Netzer]]. The excavations continued for ten seasons and covered an area of 30 hectares. The excavations also revealed remains of [[Aqueduct (water supply)|aqueducts]] to the west of Jericho. At the oasis of Jericho, Netzer uncovered new wings of Herod's winter palace, as well as a Hasmonean ([[Maccabean]]) winter palace containing a number of swimming pools and gardens.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archaeology.huji.ac.il/exhibitions/exhibit_Hasmonean.asp The Hasmonean Winter Palaces in the Jericho Valley, 2000]&lt;/ref&gt;  The complex includes the [[Jericho Synagogue]], built 70{{ndash}}50 BC and identified as one of the [[Oldest synagogues in the World|oldest synagogues]] ever found.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Oldest Synagogue Found in Israel|date=29 March 1998|publisher=The Associated Press|url=http://www.pohick.org/sts/jericho.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Site description ==
[[File:Jerycho60.jpg|thumb|Excavation site]]
Survey and excavations show that the site covers an area of 120 hectares, and is only part of Second Temple-period Jericho. A series of winter palaces were discovered, some which were shown to have been built by the [[Hasmonean]]s, and others by Herod the Great, who inherited the older estate and substantially expanded the palatial compound with new buildings. It turned out that the area of the city of Jericho was very broad. South of one of the palaces, in the area that today is the [[Aqabat Jaber]] refugee camp, remains  of luxurious houses were discovered, scattered over dozens of acres. A royal farm was discovered north of the palaces, covering an area of 450 dunams. A close connection was found between the farm and the winter palaces.

Aqueducts, which were built during the Hasmonean period, enabled the construction of the winter palaces and the farm. Two aqueducts brought water to the site from the following springs that flow year-round:

* Wadi Qelt: Ein Perat, Ein Mabua, Ein Qelt.
* Nahal Na'aran: Ein Noema, Ein Diuk, Ein Shusha.

== Hasmonean palace ==
The Hasmonean winter palace, at the northern part of the site, consisted of the following structures:
* The main building
* Swimming pool complex
* Southern division ("twin palaces")

The Hasmonean palace was built on a hill overlooking the city of Jericho. The palace was built by [[John Hyrcanus I]] (134-104 BCE) and believed to have been fortified during the reign of [[Alexander Jannaeus]] (103-76 BCE).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Eshel |first=Hanan |title=The Dead Sea Scrolls and the Hasmonean State |page=75 |url=https://books.google.co.il/books?id=t05okj1LB3QC&amp;pg=PA75}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A strong [[earthquake]] in 31 BCE destroyed the palace. Evidence to this was found in different parts of the complex. On its site King Herod built an artificial tell, or mound, on which he built his second palace. The establishment of the mound resulted in coverage of the Hasmonean palace, and thus parts of it were preserved, such as a building wall remaining 7 metres high.

The main structure of the Hasmonean palace was 50 by 50 metres. Elements of the building were as was customary for luxury palaces in the area:

* Rooms were decorated with colorful [[frescoes]], imitating marble.
* [[Stucco]] decorations in the form of building stones.
* An unroofed central courtyard.
* The water flowed into the swimming pools and buildings through clay and lead pipes, buried in the ground, and aqueducts supplied water to gardens and orchards.

Remains were found of two pairs of swimming pools: a small pair west of the palace, and a large pair north of it. It is speculated that the pools were the focus of entertainment and enjoyment of the inhabitants of the palace. Perhaps they are also the place where, according to historian [[Josephus]], [[Aristobulus III]] (53-36 BC), the last high priest from the Hasmonean dynasty, was drowned. South of the large pools was a luxurious 21 by 17 metres building, the so-called pavilion, built in the style of a [[Doric order|Doric]] temple. An axis of symmetry passed through the pools, the open courtyard, and the temple{{dubious|Pavilion? But then: north or south?|date=June 2018}} north of them.

The "twin palaces" were two surprisingly similar buildings. The hypothesis is that they were built by Queen [[Salome Alexandra|Shlomtzion]] (ruled 67–76 BCE) for her two sons, [[Hyrcanus II|Hyrcanus]] and [[Aristobulus II|Aristobulus]], in order to soften the rivalry between them that lasted nearly thirty years. The size of the palaces was 25 by 25 metres. Each of the two palaces contained a luxurious bathhouse.

Many ritual baths were found around the palace, required by their priestly owners, who had to be ritually purified before eating [[terumah]]. A ritual bath for vessels was also found, containing the remains of 800 bowls. The palace also served the last Hasmonean king, [[Antigonus II Mattathias|Antigonus Matityahu II]] (r. 40-37 BCE), as evidenced by a hoard of 20 coins.

== Herod's first palace ==
The first palace was situated on the southern bank of Wadi Qelt, on land leased from [[Cleopatra]], Queen of Egypt, who received it as a gift from [[Mark Antony]] in 36 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mfa.gov.il/mfa/israelexperience/history/pages/jericho%20-%20the%20winter%20palace%20of%20king%20herod.aspx Jericho- The Winter Palace of King Herod]&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, in the north, the Hasmonean palace was still standing. The palace was a rectangular building, 86 by 46 meters. In the center was an open courtyard with perimeter columns and a central pool draining the rainwater. In the palace were a magnificent hall, a luxurious bathhouse, and a pair of deep pools, which were apparently ritual baths.

The palace was exposed in 1951 by [[James B. Pritchard|Pritchard]], who thought it was a [[Gymnasium (ancient Greece)|gymnasium]]. After excavation of the palace, it was covered over with sand.

== Herod's second palace ==
The second palace was built in 31 BCE. Herod won the trust of Emperor [[Augustus]] and in return received the Jericho area he had previously lost to the by then defunct Queen Cleopatra. After the earthquake of 31 BCE Herod decided to build a second palace on the ruins of the Hasmonean palace. He combined the pools of the Hasmonean palace into one large pool, 32 by 18 meters. The second palace (north of Wadi Qelt), along with the first palace (south of Wadi Qelt), served Herod for residential and ceremonial purposes.

A unique feature of the second palace was its residential wing, which contained a designated recreation area. The villa was built on an artificial tell covering the Hasmonean palace: 35 by 43 meters tall,{{dubious|Nonsensical. Check source.|date=June 2018}} eight meters above the surroundings, providing a view of the estate's orchards and the surroundings. The second palace was full of gardens. In the pleasure wing were the big pool and a bathhouse, which has been well preserved.

== Herod's third palace ==
[[File:Jericho Herodian bath.JPG|thumb|250px|Bath from Herod's third palace]]

The third palace was the most magnificent of the palaces. It was established on both sides of Wadi Qelt. [[Ehud Netzer]], the editor of excavations at the site, believe that palace residents could see water flowing in the riverbed for up to two months a year, letting the viewers feel like they were on the edge of an actual river. The builders, who apparently were from [[Italy]], used construction methods that were common in their homeland such as:

* [[Opus reticulatum]] - small stones, 10&amp;nbsp;cm by 10&amp;nbsp;cm, placed in diagonal rows. In Jericho they were anointed with white or colored plaster.
* [[Opus Koodroas]] - rectangular stones.

Local [[mud bricks]] were also layered on top of stone construction. After being covered with plaster, there was no difference between them and the models from Italy.

The third palace of Herod, in the center of the site, included the following buildings:

* The north wing.
* Sunken garden.
* The southern mound.
* Big pool.

== Industrial area ==
The industrial area was next to residential buildings and service buildings.

== Royal estate ==
In the estate a huge wine-press was found, which was probably used for making wine and "date honey". Farm crops, according to literary sources, were: [[palm trees]], [[persimmon]] resin, and sap, which produced perfumes and medicines. Some of them were sent overseas. It was an intelligent use of the warm climate of the place.

[[File: HSBC Hong Kong Headquarters.jpg|thumb|right|The [[HSBC Building (Hong Kong)|HSBC Hong Kong headquarters]], completed in 1985, is one example of high-tech architecture.]] 
'''High-tech architecture''', also known as '''Structural Expressionism''', is a type of '''Late Modern''' [[architectural style]] that emerged in the 1970s, incorporating elements of high-tech industry and technology into building design. High-tech architecture appeared as revamped [[Modern architecture|modernism]], an extension of those previous ideas helped by even more technological advances. This category serves as a bridge between modernism and [[Postmodern architecture|post-modernism]]; however, there remain gray areas as to where one category ends and the other begins. In the 1980s, high-tech architecture became more difficult to distinguish from post-modern architecture.  Some of its themes and ideas were later absorbed into the style of [[Neo-Futurism]] art and architectural movement.

Like [[Brutalism]], Structural Expressionist buildings reveal their structure on the outside as well as the inside, but with visual emphasis placed on the internal steel and/or concrete skeletal structure as opposed to exterior concrete walls.  In buildings such as the [[Pompidou Centre]]{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}{{dubious|date=December 2016}}, this idea of revealed structure is taken to the extreme, with apparently structural components serving little or no structural role. In this case, the use of "structural" steel is a stylistic or aesthetic matter.

The style's premier practitioners include [[Colombian Americans|Colombo-American]] architect [[Bruce Graham]] and [[Bangladeshi Americans|Bangladeshi-American]] architect [[Fazlur Rahman Khan]] for the [[John Hancock Centre]], [[Willis Tower]] and [[Onterie Center]], [[United Kingdom|British]] architects [[Norman Foster, Baron Foster of Thames Bank|Norman, Lord Foster]], [[Richard Rogers|Richard, Lord Rogers]], Sir [[Michael Hopkins (architect)|Michael Hopkins]], [[Italy|Italian]] architect [[Renzo Piano]], and [[Spain|Spanish]] architect [[Santiago Calatrava]], known for his organic, skeleton-like designs. Early high-tech buildings were referred to by historian [[Reyner Banham]] as "serviced sheds" due to their exposure of mechanical services in addition to the structure. Most of these early examples used exposed structural steel as their material of choice. As hollow structural sections had only become widely available in the early 1970s, high-tech architecture saw much experimentation with this material.

==Background==

[[File:Lloyd's 14.jpg|thumb|upright|The [[Lloyd's building]], completed 1986, London]]
Buildings in this architectural style were constructed mainly in [[North America]] and [[Europe]]. It is deeply connected with what is called the [[Chicago school (architecture)|Second School of Chicago]] which emerged after [[World War II]]. The main content is that the technological kind of construction, mostly with steel and glass, is expressed in a formal independent way to gain [[aesthetic]] qualities from it. The first proper example are the [[860-880 Lake Shore Drive Apartments]] by [[Germany|German]] architect [[Ludwig Mies van der Rohe]].{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}{{dubious|date=December 2016}}

==Name==

The style got its name from the book ''High Tech: The [[Industrial Style]] and Source Book for The Home'', written by design journalists Joan Kron  and Suzanne Slesin and published in November 1978 by Clarkson N. Potter, New York.  The book, illustrated with hundreds of photos, showed how designers, architects, and  homeowners were appropriating classic industrial objects—library shelving, chemical glass, metal deck plate, restaurant supply, factory and airport runway light fixtures, movers' quilts, industrial carpeting etc.—found in industrial catalogues and putting these to use in residential settings. The foreword to the book by architect [[Emilio Ambasz]], former curator of design at the [[Museum of Modern Art]], put the trend in historical context.

As a result of the publicity and popularity of the book, the decorating style became known as "High-Tech", and accelerated the entry of the still-obscure term "high-tech" into everyday language. In 1979, the term high-tech appeared for the first time in a ''[[The New Yorker|New Yorker]]'' magazine cartoon showing a woman berating her husband for not being high-tech enough: "You're middle-, middle-, middle-tech." After ''[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]'' excerpted Kron and Slesin's book in six installments, mainstream retailers across the United States, beginning with [[Macy's]] New York, started featuring high-tech decor in windows and in furniture departments. But credit should go to a shop on 64th Street and Lexington Avenue in New York, Ad Hoc Housewares, which opened in 1977,  for marketing these objects to a residential audience before anyone else. The book went on to be reprinted in England, France, and Japan, and like the original, each edition included a directory of local sources for the objects.

==Aims==
The high-tech architecture was, in some ways, a response to growing disillusionment with modern architecture. The realization of [[Le Corbusier]]'s urban development plans led to cities with monotonous and standardized buildings. Enthusiasm for economic building led to extremely low-quality finishes, with subsequent degradation countering a now-waning aesthetic novelty. High-tech architecture created a new aesthetic in contrast with standard modern architecture. In ''High Tech: The Industrial Style and Source Book for The Home'', when discussing the high-tech aesthetic, the authors emphasized using elements "your parents might find insulting". This humor so aptly demonstrates the rebellious attitude.

Kron and Slesin further explain the term "high-tech" as one being used in architectural circles to describe an increasing number of residences and public buildings with a "nuts-and-bolts, exposed-pipes, technological look". A prime example of this is the [[Centre Pompidou]] in Paris. This highlights one of the aims of high-tech architecture, to show the technical elements of the building by externalizing them. Thus, the technical aspects create the building's aesthetic.

For interior design, there was a trend of using formerly industrial appliances as household objects, e.g. [[Beaker (glassware)|chemical beakers]] as vases for flowers. This was because of an aim to use an industrial aesthetic. This was assisted by the conversion of former industrial spaces into residential spaces. High-tech architecture aimed to give everything an industrial appearance.

Another aspect to the aims of high-tech architecture was that of a renewed belief in the power of technology to improve the world. This is especially evident in [[Kenzo Tange]]'s plans for technically sophisticated buildings in [[Japan]]'s post-war boom in the 1960s, but few of these plans actually became buildings.
High-tech architecture aimed to achieve a new industrial aesthetic, spurred on by the renewed faith in the progression of technology.

But however prominent the industrial look appeared, the functional element of modern architecture was very much retained. The pieces still served a purpose in the building's function. The function of the building was also aimed as not being set. This dynamic property means that a building should be a "catalyst", the "technical services are provided but do not become set."

==Characteristics==
[[File:Berlin - ICC3.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Internationales Congress Centrum Berlin]] opened in 1979.]]
Structures of high-tech architecture have varied somewhat, yet all have accentuated technical elements. They included the prominent display of the building's technical and functional components, and an orderly arrangement and use of pre-fabricated elements. Glass walls and steel frames were also immensely popular.

To boast technical features, they were externalized, often along with load-bearing structures. There can be no more illustrious example than [[Centre Georges Pompidou|Pompidou Centre.]] The [[Duct (HVAC)|ventilation ducts]] are all prominently shown on the outside. This was a radical design, as previous ventilation ducts would have been a component hidden on the inside of the building. The means of access to the building is also on the outside, with the large tube allowing visitors to enter the building.

The orderly and logical fashion in which buildings in the high-tech architectural style are designed to keep to their functional essence is demonstrated in [[Norman Foster, Baron Foster of Thames Bank|Norman Foster]]'s [[HSBC Hong Kong headquarters building|Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank HQ]]. Besides the technology being the overriding feature of the building, its design is very much functionally orientated. The large interior open space and the easy access to all floors enhance the function of being a bank. Also, the elements of the buildings are very neatly composed to achieve optimal orderliness in order to logically solve the problem of the needs of a bank. This can be seen in the levels' structure and in the escalators.

High-tech buildings make persistent use of glass curtain walls and steel structure. They are greatly indebted to modern architecture for this, and are influenced by [[Mies van der Rohe]]'s highrise buildings. [[Bruce Graham]]'s [[Willis Tower]] demonstrated that with glass walls and skeleton pipe structure of steel, a very tall building could be built. 
&lt;!--
High-tech architecture developed a technical language, free of historicist ornaments likes it predecessor, modern architecture. An example of this is the [[Žižkov Television Tower]], [[Prague]]. From afar the unconventional structure looks like a rocket launching pad. This takes inspiration from the technical advancements of the age. COMMENT: WHAT HAS THIS GOT TO DO WITH THE DEVELOPMENT OF A "TECHNICAL LANGUAGE"?
--&gt;
Many high-tech buildings meant their purposes to be dynamic. This could best be explained by [[Günther Behnisch]] and [[Frei Otto]]'s [[Olympic Stadium (Munich)|Munich Olympic Stadium]]. This structure made sport in the open possible and is meant to be used for many purposes. Originally an abandoned airfield, it is now a sports stadium, used for various disciplines.

Buildings designed in this style usually consist of a clear [[glass]] façade, with the building's network of support beams exposed behind it. Perhaps the most famous and easily recognized building built in this style is [[I.M. Pei]]'s [[Bank of China Tower, Hong Kong|Bank of China Tower]] in [[Hong Kong]]. The [[World Trade Center (1973–2001)|World Trade Center]] in [[New York City]], although generally considered to be an [[International Style (architecture)|International Style]] building, was technically a Structural Expressionist design due to its load-bearing steel frame.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}{{dubious|date=December 2016}}

The '''International Forestry Resources and Institutions''' (IFRI) Network is a collective of research partners at 12 universities or [[non-governmental organization]]s in 11 countries around the world that focus on how institutions and governance arrangements shape forest use and [[forest management|management]] outcomes. Scholars and policy makers affiliated with IFRI are interested in understanding the role of formal and informal institutions in enhancing livelihoods and adaptive capacity of peoples, conserving biodiversity, and promoting greater sustainability in [[carbon sequestration]]. IFRI's goal is to carry out rigorous research that can help policy makers and forest users design and implement improved evidence-based forest policies. IFRI comprises partner collaborating research institutes in [[North America]], [[Latin America]], [[Asia]] and [[Africa]]. IFRI utilizes the Institutional Analysis and Development (IAD) framework, created at the Workshop in Political Theory and Policy Analysis at [[Indiana University]] by Elinor Ostrom and her colleagues.

The IFRI research program was initiated in 1992 at Indiana University. It moved in 2006 to [[University of Michigan]] where it is currently housed at the School of Natural Resources and Environment and coordinated by Arun Agrawal.

==Collaborating Resource Centers==

==Goals==
Some of the goals of the IFRI network are to:
* determine how to change processes leading to [[deforestation]] in many countries of the world;
* assess the nature of tradeoffs among forest conservation, livelihoods promotion, and carbon sequestration
* analyze the role of institutions and policies in promoting better forest outcomes

IFRI provides a way for people to collect, store, and analyze data over time about forests and the communities that use forests. It can be used to:
* conduct baseline studies;
* measure change over time in forest conditions and in local governance structures; and
* share information with pertinent and interested colleagues.

The IFRI is unique from other research programs and databases in that:
* it is composed of a network of Collaborating Research Centers (CRCs) that utilize a common research methodology and database that includes a diverse array of variables taken from the environmental and social sciences; 
* the design of the IFRI research instruments is based on the Institutional Analysis and Development (IAD) framework and previous theoretical and empirical studies.  The IAD framework, developed by colleagues at the Workshop in Political Theory and Policy Analysis at Indiana University, provides a unique way for researchers to transcend disciplinary boundaries;
* IFRI focuses and collects data on institutional, social, and ecological variables which can be stored in a single IFRI database, and analyzed to understand the inter-relationships among social and ecological processes and outcomes.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9919">'''Islamic graffiti''' is a [[genre]] of [[graffiti]] created by [[Islam]]ic people or by people inspired by the Islamic religion. Containing Islamic themes, this type of [[art]] finds expression in a variety of forms. The most common languages used are English and Arabic.   Like all other forms of art, graffiti can serve as a medium for instigating political or social change, or as a form of self-expression.

==Socio-political==
===Sticker art===
[[Sticker art]] refers to the practice of posting images or phrases to convey a message.[[File:Shop bamako posters marche fadjiguila.jpg|thumb|An example of Islamic sticker art in Mali]]
A collaborative project called "INSIDE OUT: Artocracy in Tunisia" uses sticker art to promote the spirit of democracy in post-revolutionary Tunisia. Prior to the revolution, only presidential photography could be found in the public space. A group of six photographers, along with a French graffiti artist called JR, replaced these pictures with black and white photographs of anonymous Tunisian people. Their goal is to inspire the people of Tunisia to see themselves in a new light. One of the photographers states: "If people want to tear them down, or write something on them, that's part of the project, that's okay."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Ryan|first=Yasmine|title=Art challenges Tunisian revolutionaries|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2011/03/201132223217876176.html|accessdate=9 June 2012|newspaper=Al Jazeera|date=26 March 2011|agency=Al Jazeera|language=English, Arabic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Subvertising===
[[Subvertising]] refers to the practice of making spoofs or parodies of political advertisements. 
Princess Hijab, an anonymous street artist from Paris, paints Muslim veils on advertisements in the subway. She refers to this as "hijabisation." Since the enforcement of the "burqa ban," in which women are prohibited from wearing the burqa in public places, her art has sparked feminist and fundamentalist questions. It is not known if Princess Hijab is a Muslim or even a woman.  "The real identity behind Princess Hijab is of no importance," she has been quoted. Inspired by Naomi Klein's [[No Logo]], she drew her first veil in 2006 on the French rapper [[Diam's]], who subsequently happened to convert to Islam and now wears a veil. Graffiti on the subways in Paris is considered vandalism. Consequently, Princess Hijab has become highly selective and only paints four to five advertisements a year. She chooses to combine veils with advertisements because they are both "dogmas that can be questioned."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Chrisafis|first=Angelique|title=Cornered – Princess Hijab, Paris's elusive graffiti artist|url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2010/nov/11/princess-hijab-paris-graffiti-artist|accessdate=9 June 2012|newspaper=The Guardian|date=10 November 2010|agency=Guardian News and Media}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spray paint===
[[File:I am a Muslim and I love my Christian siblings.jpg|thumb|Mural in Cairo reads "I am Muslim and I love my Christian siblings."]]
Graffiti as a form of communication in [[State of Palestine|Palestine]] began in 1987 during the first Intifada. This was a period in which there were no Palestinian TV or Radio stations in the Gaza Strip. Murals commemorated martyrs as well as called protestors to action. Israeli military would force Palestinians to wash off graffiti from their homes. The Dome of the Rock was common among murals in Palestine. In 2006, [[Hamas]] took over the graffiti scene. Hamas would encourage people to perform the first of the day’s five prayers through street art.&lt;ref&gt;Gröndahl, Mia. ''Gaza Graffiti: Messages of Love and Politics''. Cairo: American University in Cairo, 2009. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, The [[West Bank]] wall is covered in graffiti. Numerous messages can be found including marriage proposals, notes to friends, and jokes. Also common are messages of peace. One reads: "Mirror, mirror on the wall. When will this senseless object fall?" "Trying to imagine a clear view between Palestine and Israel," is another. Messages such as these splatter across the wall, and some graffiti artists will paint your message for a fee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Gray|first=Melissa|title=Palestinian graffiti spreads message of peace|url=http://articles.cnn.com/2009-04-16/world/palestinian.wall.graffiti_1_west-bank-five-palestinian-villages-barrier-cuts?_s=PM:WORLD|accessdate=9 June 2012|newspaper=CNN|date=16 April 2009|agency=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable graffiti artists==
===Middle East===
''See also: [[Graffiti in Iran]].''

From [[Lebanon]], [[Yazan Halwani]] has developed his form of graffiti based on Arabic calligraphy, figures and culture. His style mixes portraiture and Arabic calligraphy on large walls in [[Beirut]]. Halwani thinks that graffiti in the Arab world and Beirut should not evolve into a form of vandalism and therefore he says that his murals try to adapt to their environment and not against it.&lt;ref&gt;Alabaster, Olivia. [http://www.dailystar.com.lb/Culture/Lifestyle/2013/Feb-09/205688-i-like-to-write-beirut-as-its-the-city-that-gave-us-everything.ashx#axzz3DCxf8Utr "I like to write Beirut as it’s the city that gave us everything"], ''[[The Daily Star (Lebanon)|The Daily Star]]'', Beirut, 09 February 2013. Retrieved on 13 September 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

From Tehran, graffiti artist [[A1one]] (a.k.a. Tanha) has been credited with starting the modern street art movement in [[Tehran]] and [[Middle East]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Vandalog|title=A1one in Tehran IRAN|url=http://blog.vandalog.com/2011/05/from-a1one-in-tehran-iran/|accessdate=8 October 2012|newspaper=Vandalog|date=3 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He started his career as an artist in the late 1990s with indoor painting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title={{sic|Graffitti|hide=y}} in Tehran: Instigating Political Change |url=http://socialactive.wordpress.com/2011/02/16/graffitti-in-teheran-instigating-political-change/|work=the bohemian|publisher=Social Active|accessdate=9 June 2012|date=16 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Now he is an international artist, known for his innovative Arabic and Persian calligraphic street art painted in various countries.
[[File:Tehranurbanartalone.jpg|thumb|A wall spraypainted by "[[A1one]]" in Tehran]] 

In 2003, he moved outdoors by spraying a 30x40cm stencil on university walls to express to the "uncommon pressure" at the university which was "endured in silence." However, the motivations behind his art are not protest. He states that his art is simply personal expression: "A drawing on the street is similar to a letter: It proves that there is a writer."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Uleshka |title=A1one: 1st generation Graffiti in Iran |url=http://pingmag.jp/2007/01/19/a1one-1st-generation-graffiti-in-iran/ |accessdate=9 June 2012 |newspaper=PingMag |date=19 January 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080712042707/http://pingmag.jp/2007/01/19/a1one-1st-generation-graffiti-in-iran/ |archivedate=12 July 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Arab World, three major areas of interest can be identified: Lebanon, the Palestinian Territories and the Arab states that were involved in the Arab Spring. In these areas, graffiti has been perceived, both by the public and the media, as a barometer of the society. Lebanon’s religious and ethnic diversity and its position at the crossroad of the Mediterranean basin and the Arab World have contributed to the appearance and development of an active youth culture and graffiti is part of it. Secondly, the Palestinian Territories are a space where graffiti is one of the most powerful forms of protest against what its inhabitants perceive as a contemporary form of colonization. Last but not least, the social importance of graffiti and its militant functions have recently been reflected by the international media, within the coverage of the uprisings in Tunisia, Egypt, Libya and Syria. The media coverage of the Arab Spring has drawn attention to a type of both artistic and political expression typical for the young people in the MENA region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Nicoarea|first=Georgiana|url=https://www.academia.edu/2219214/Cultural_Interactions_in_The_Graffiti_Subculture_of_The_Arab_World._Between_Globalization_and_Cosmopolitanism|title=Cultural Interactions in the Graffiti Subculture of the Arab World |publisher=Romano-Arabica Journal |accessdate=2014-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Europe===
After growing up in Paris during the late 80s and early 90s, graffiti artist eL Seed found himself inspired by hip-hop culture. With parents from Temoula, [[Tunisia]], he explored his North African origins by learning calligraphy. Before becoming an artist, he pursued degrees in marketing and business. After befriending a graffiti artist known as Hest1, he began to combine his love of graffiti and calligraphy. Today, he creates both personal exhibitions as well as murals for commission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Alwazir|first=Atiaf Z.|title=Garbage Collectors and the Struggle For Workers' Rights in Yemen|url=http://aslanmedia.com/arts-culture/324-from-elan/4175-el-seed-explores-identity-with-graffiti-art|accessdate=9 June 2012|newspaper=Aslan Media|date=6 June 2012|agency=Aslan Media}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also combining calligraphy with graffiti, Niels Meulman (also known as SHOE) coined the phrase "[[calligraffiti]]." Born in Amsterdam, SHOE has worked for ad agencies such as BBDO and the television channel [[MTV]].  The Metropolitan Museum of Art called calligraffiti "a new explosive art form."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Calligraffiti: An Explosive New Art Form (17 pics)|url=http://www.mymodernmet.com/profiles/blogs/calligraffiti-an-explosive-new|work=My Modern Met|publisher=My Modern Met|accessdate=9 June 2012|author=alice|date=4 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Large deformation diffeomorphic metric mapping''' ('''LDDMM''') is a specific suite of algorithms used for diffeomorphic mapping and manipulating dense imagery based on  '''diffeomorphic metric mapping''' within the academic discipline of [[Computational anatomy]], to be distinguished from its precursor based on '''diffeomorphic mapping'''.  The distinction between the two is that diffeomorphic metric maps satisfy the property that the length associated to their flow away from the identity induces a metric on the [[Computational anatomy#The Diffeomorphism Group of Computational Anatomy|group of diffeomorphisms]], which in turn induces a metric on the orbit of [[Computational anatomy#Shapes and forms|Shapes and Forms]] within the field of [[Computational anatomy|Computational Anatomy]]. The study of shapes and forms with the metric of diffeomorphic metric mapping is called [[Computational Anatomy#Diffeomorphometry:the metric space of shapes and forms|Diffeomorphometry]].

A '''diffeomorphic mapping''' system is a system designed to map, manipulate, and transfer information which is stored in many types of spatially distributed medical imagery.

Diffeomorphic mapping is the underlying technology for mapping and analyzing information measured in human anatomical coordinate systems which have been measured via Medical imaging{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}}. Diffeomorphic mapping is a broad term that actually refers to a number of different algorithms, processes, and methods. It is attached to many operations and has many applications for analysis and visualization. Diffeomorphic mapping can be used to relate various sources of information which are indexed as a function of spatial position as the key index variable. Diffeomorphisms are by their Latin root structure preserving transformations, which are in turn differentiable and therefore smooth, allowing for the calculation of metric based quantities such as arc length and surface areas. Spatial location and extents in human anatomical coordinate systems can be recorded via a variety of Medical imaging modalities, generally termed multi-modal medical imagery, providing either scalar and or vector quantities at each spatial location. Examples are scalar [[T1 (MRI)|T1]] or T2 [[Magnetic resonance imaging|Magnetic resonance imagery]], or as 3x3 diffusion tensor matrices [[Diffusion MRI]] and [[Diffusion-weighted imaging]], to scalar densities associated to [[Computed Tomography]] (CT), or functional imagery such as temporal data of [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]] and scalar densities such as [[Positron emission tomography|Positron emission tomography (PET)]].

Computational anatomy is a subdiscipline within the broader field of [[Neuroinformatics]] within [[Bioinformatics]] and [[Medical imaging]]. The first algorithm for dense image mapping via diffeomorphic metric mapping was Beg's LDDMM&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220660081|title=Computing Large Deformation Metric Mappings via Geodesic Flows of Diffeomorphisms|journal=International Journal of Computer Vision|doi=10.1023/B:VISI.0000043755.93987.aa|access-date=2016-01-27|author1=M.F.

In a more general sense, diffeomorphic mapping is any solution that registers or builds correspondences between dense coordinate systems in Medical imaging by ensuring the solutions are diffeomorphic.

The distinction between diffeomorphic metric mapping forming the basis for LDDMM and the earliest methods of diffeomorphic mapping is the introduction of a Hamilton principle of least-action in which large deformations are selected of shortest length corresponding to geodesic flows. This important distinction arises from the original formulation of the [[Riemannian metric and Lie-bracket in computational anatomy|Riemannian metric]] corresponding to the right-invariance. The lengths of these geodesics give the metric in the metric space structure of human anatomy. Non-geodeisc formulations of diffeomorphic mapping in general does not correspond to any metric formulation.

The central focus of the sub-field of '''[[Computational anatomy]] (CA)''' within [[medical imaging]]  is mapping information across anatomical coordinate systems at the 1 millimeter [[morphome]] scale. In CA mapping of dense information measured within [[Magnetic resonance imaging|Magnetic resonance image]] (MRI) based coordinate systems such as in the brain has been solved via inexact matching of 3D MR images one onto the other. The earliest introduction of the use of '''diffeomorphic mapping''' via '''large deformation''' flows of [[diffeomorphisms]] for transformation of coordinate systems in image analysis and medical imaging was by Christensen, Rabbitt and Miller &lt;ref name="Christensen 1435–1447"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Deformable Templates Using Large Deformation Kinematics|journal = Trans.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The introduction of flows, which are akin to the equations of motion used in fluid dynamics, exploit the notion that dense coordinates in image analysis follow the [[Lagrangian and Eulerian specification of the flow field|Lagrangian and Eulerian]] equations of motion. This model becomes more appropriate for cross-sectional studies in which brains and or hearts are not necessarily deformations of one to the other. Methods based on linear or non-linear elasticity energetics which grows with distance from the identity mapping of the template, is not appropriate for cross-sectional study. Rather, in models based on Lagrangian and Eulerian flows of diffeomorphisms, the constraint is associated to topological properties, such as open sets being preserved, coordinates not crossing implying uniqueness and existence of the inverse mapping, and connected sets remaining connected.  The use of diffeomorphic methods grew quickly to dominate the field of mapping methods post Christensen's original paper, with fast and symmetric methods becoming available.&lt;ref name=":3"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

Such methods are powerful in that they introduce notions of regularity of the solutions so that they can be differentiated and local inverses can be calculated. The disadvantages of these methods is that there was no associated global least-action property which could score the flows of minimum energy. This contrasts the geodesic motions which are central to the study of  [[Rigid-body kinematics|Rigid body kinematics]] and the many problems solved in [[Physics]] via&lt;nowiki/&gt; [[Hamilton's principal of least action|Hamilton's principle of least action]].

The template is mapped onto the target by defining a variational problem in which the template is transformed via the diffeomorphism used as a change of coordinate to minimize a squared-error matching condition between the transformed template and the target.

The diffeomorphisms are generated via smooth flows  &lt;math&gt;\phi_t,  t \in [0,1]&lt;/math&gt; , with &lt;math&gt;\varphi \doteq \phi_1&lt;/math&gt;, satisfying the [[Computational anatomy#Lagrangian and Eulerian flows for generating diffeomorphisms|Lagrangian and Eulerian specification of the flow field]] associated to the ordinary differential equation,

In CA the space of vector fields &lt;math&gt;(V, \| \cdot \|_V )&lt;/math&gt; are modelled as a [[Computational anatomy#The Smoothness Condition on Vector fields as Modelled in a Reproducing kernel Hilbert space|reproducing Kernel Hilbert space]] (RKHS) defined by a 1-1, differential operator&lt;math&gt; A: V \rightarrow V^*  &lt;/math&gt; determining the norm &lt;math&gt;  \| v\|_V^2 \doteq \int_{R^3} Av\cdot v dx, \ v \in V \ ,

where the integral is calculated by integration by parts when &lt;math&gt;Av&lt;/math&gt; is a generalized function  in the dual space &lt;math&gt; V^*&lt;/math&gt;. 
The differential operator is selected so that the Green's kernel, the inverse of the operator, is continuously differentiable in each variable implying that the [[Computational anatomy#The Smoothness Condition on Vector fields as Modelled in a Reproducing kernel Hilbert space|vector fields support 1-continuous derivative]]; see&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Dupuis |first1=Paul |last2=Grenander |first2=Ulf |last3=Miller |first3=Michael I. |title=Variational problems on flows of diffeomorphisms for image matching |journal=Quarterly of Applied Mathematics |date=1 September 1998 |volume=56 |issue=3 |pages=587–600 |doi=10.1090/qam/1632326}}&lt;/ref&gt; for the necessary conditions on the norm for existence of solutions.

{{NumBlk||&lt;math&gt; \begin{cases}

This implies that the fixed point satisfy 
:&lt;math&gt; Av_0= -\sum_i (D \phi_1)(x_i)^T (y_i - \phi_1(x_i)) \delta_{x_i} &lt;/math&gt;

First Order Variation of the Flow and Vector Field for Dense Image and Landmark Matching |

The first order variation in the vector fields &lt;math&gt;v+\epsilon \delta v&lt;/math&gt; requires the variation of  &lt;math&gt;\phi^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; generalizes the [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] [[Invertible matrix#Derivative of the matrix inverse|perturbation of the inverse]]  via &lt;math&gt;(\phi + \epsilon \delta \phi \circ \phi)\circ (\phi^{-1} + \epsilon \delta \phi^{-1} \circ \phi^{-1}) = id + o(\epsilon)&lt;/math&gt; giving  &lt;math&gt;\delta \phi^{-1} \circ \phi^{-1} =-(D \phi_1^{-1}) \delta \phi  &lt;/math&gt; . 
To express the variation in terms of &lt;math&gt; \delta v &lt;/math&gt;, use the solution to the [[Lie bracket of vector fields|Lie bracket]]
&lt;math&gt;\frac{d }{d t} \left( \delta \phi_{|\phi} \right) = (Dv)_{| \phi} \delta \phi_{| \phi} + \delta v_{| \phi}&lt;/math&gt; giving
:&lt;math&gt;
\delta \phi_1 = (D \phi_1)_{|\phi_1^{-1}} \int_0^1 (D \phi_t)_{|\phi_1^{-1}}^{-1} (\delta v_t )_{\phi_t \circ \phi_1^{-1} } dt
&lt;/math&gt;

*Image Matching:
Taking the directional derivative of the image endpoint condition &lt;math&gt; E(\phi) = \int_X | I \circ \phi^{-1} - J |^2 dx &lt;/math&gt; gives
:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{d}{d \epsilon} \frac{1}{2} \int_X | I \circ ( \phi^{-1} + \epsilon \delta \phi^{-1} \circ \phi^{-1})-J|^2 dx|_{\epsilon =0}
=\int_X (I \circ \phi^{-1} -J ) \nabla I|_{\phi^{-1}} \delta \phi^{-1} \circ \phi^{-1} dx
&lt;/math&gt;&lt;math&gt;
= \int_X (I \circ \phi^{-1} -J ) \nabla I|_{\phi^{-1}} 
(-D \phi_1^{-1}) \delta \phi dx
&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; =\int_X(I \circ \phi_1^{-1} -J) \nabla I|_{\phi_1^{-1}} (- D \phi_1)_{|\phi_1^{-1}}^{-1}(D \phi_1)_{|\phi_1^{-1}}) \int_0^1 (D \phi_t)_{|\phi_1^{-1}}^{-1} (\delta v_t)_{|{\phi_t \circ \phi_1^{-1}}} dt dx
&lt;/math&gt;.
 
Substituting &lt;math&gt;
\phi_{t1} \doteq \phi_1 \circ \phi_t^{-1} &lt;/math&gt; gives the necessary condition for an optimum:
:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{d}{d \epsilon}C(v +\epsilon\delta v)|_{\epsilon=0} = \int_0^1 \int_X Av_t \cdot \delta v_t dx dt -\int_0^1 \int_X (I \circ \phi_1^{-1} -J) \nabla I|_{\phi_1^{-1}}(D \phi_t)_{|\phi_1^{-1}}^{-1} (\delta v_t)_{|{\phi_t \circ \phi_1^{-1}}} dx dt

&lt;/math&gt;.

*Landmark Matching: 
Take the variation in the vector fields &lt;math&gt;v+\epsilon \delta v&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt; \frac{1}{2} \sum_{i} |\phi_1(x_i)-y_i)|^2 &lt;/math&gt;
use the chain rule for the perturbation &lt;math&gt; \delta \phi \circ \phi &lt;/math&gt; to gives the first variation

: &lt;math&gt; \sum_i (\phi_1(x_i) - y_i) \cdot D \phi_1 |_{\phi_1^{-1}(\phi_1(x_i))} \int_0^1 (D \phi_t)_{|\phi_1^{-1}(\phi_1(x_i))}^{-1} \delta v_t |_{\phi_t \circ \phi_1^{-1} (\phi_1(x_i))} dt

&lt;/math&gt;
becomes

==LDDMM ODF ==
High angular resolution diffusion imaging (HARDI) addresses the well-known limitation of DTI, that is, DTI can only reveal one dominant fiber orientation at each location. HARDI measures diffusion along &lt;math&gt; n &lt;/math&gt; uniformly distributed directions on the sphere and can characterize more complex fiber geometries by reconstructing an orientation distribution function (ODF) that characterizes the angular profile of the diffusion probability density function of water molecules. The ODF is a function defined on a unit sphere, &lt;math&gt; {\mathbb{S}}^2 &lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Du|first1=J|last2=Goh|first2=A|last3=Qiu|first3=A|title=Diffeomorphic metric mapping of high angular resolution diffusion imaging based on Riemannian structure of orientation distribution functions|journal=IEEE Trans Med Imaging|date=2012|volume=31|issue=5|pages=1021–1033|doi=10.1109/TMI.2011.2178253|pmid=22156979}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Denote the square-root ODF (&lt;math&gt;{\sqrt{\text{ODF}}} &lt;/math&gt;) as &lt;math&gt; \psi({\bf s}) &lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt; \psi({\bf s}) &lt;/math&gt; is non-negative to ensure uniqueness and &lt;math&gt; \int_{{\bf s}\in  {\mathbb{S}}^2} \psi^2({\bf s}) d{\bf s}=1&lt;/math&gt;. The metric defines the distance between two &lt;math&gt;{\sqrt{\text{ODF}}} &lt;/math&gt; functions &lt;math&gt; \psi_1, \psi_2 \in \Psi &lt;/math&gt; as 
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\rho(\psi_1,\psi_2)=
\|\log_{\psi_1}(\psi_2)\|_{\psi_1} 
=\cos^{-1} \langle \psi_1, \psi_2 \rangle = 
\cos^{-1}\left(\int_{{\bf s}\in {\mathbb{S}}^2} \psi_1({\bf s}) \psi_2({\bf s})d{\bf s}\right),
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt; \langle \cdot, \cdot \rangle &lt;/math&gt; is the normal dot product between points in the sphere under the &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{L}^2 &lt;/math&gt; metric.
The template and target are denoted
&lt;math&gt; \psi_{\mathrm{temp}}({\bf s},x)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\psi_{\mathrm{targ}}({\bf s}, x)&lt;/math&gt;,&lt;math&gt; {\bf s} \in {{\mathbb{S}}^2} &lt;/math&gt;&lt;math&gt; x \in X &lt;/math&gt; indexed across the unit sphere and the image domain, with the target indexed similarly.

Define the variational problem assuming that two ODF volumes can be generated from one to another via flows of diffeomorphisms &lt;math&gt; \phi_t &lt;/math&gt;, which are solutions of ordinary differential equations 
&lt;math&gt; \dot \phi_t = v_t (\phi_t), t \in [0,1],\phi_0={id}&lt;/math&gt;. 
The group action of the diffeomorphism on the template is given according to  
&lt;math&gt;\phi_1 \cdot \psi (x)\doteq  (D\phi_1) \psi \circ \phi_1^{-1}(x), x \in X &lt;/math&gt;,
where &lt;math&gt; (D\phi_1) &lt;/math&gt; is the Jacobian of the affined transformed ODF and is defined as
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
(D \phi_1) \psi\circ \phi_1^{-1}(x) =   \sqrt{\frac{\det{\bigl(D_{\phi_1^{-1}}\phi_1 \bigr)^{-1}} }{\left\|{\bigl(D_{\phi_1^{-1}}\phi_1 \bigr)^{-1} } {\bf s} \right\|^3} } \quad
\psi \left( \frac{(D_{\phi_1^{-1}}\phi_1 \bigr)^{-1} {\bf s}}{\|(D_{\phi_1^{-1}}\phi_1 \bigr)^{-1} {\bf s}\|}, \phi_1^{-1}(x) \right) .
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

The LDDMM variational problem is defined as
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\min_{v: \dot \phi_t =
v_t \circ \phi_t,\phi_0={
id}}\int_0^1 \int_{R^3} Av_t \cdot v_t dx \ dt 
 +\lambda \int_{R^3}\|\log_{(D\phi_1) \psi_{\mathrm{temp}} \circ \phi_1^{-1}(x)}(\psi_{\mathrm{targ}}(x))\|^2_{(D\phi_1) \psi_{\mathrm{temp}}\circ \phi_1^{-1}(x)}dx 
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;.

| Proof of Hamiltonian Dynamics
|
The [[Computational anatomy#Hamiltonian formulation of Computational Anatomy|Hamiltonian dynamics]] with advected state and control dynamics  &lt;math&gt; q_t = I \circ \phi_t^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt; \dot q = - \nabla q \cdot v &lt;/math&gt; with extended Hamiltonian 
&lt;math&gt; H(q,p,v) = (p|-\nabla q \cdot v ) -\frac{1}{2} (Av|v) &lt;/math&gt; gives the variational problem&lt;ref name="Miller 447–509"/&gt; 
:&lt;math&gt;
\min_{p,q,v} C(p,q,v) \doteq (p|\dot q)-\left( (p|-\nabla q \cdot v ) -\frac{1}{2} (Av|v) \right) + E(q_1)
= (p|\dot q) - H(p,q,v) +E(q_1) \ .
&lt;/math&gt;
The first variation gives the condition on the optimizing vector field &lt;math&gt;Av=-p\nabla q &lt;/math&gt;, with the endpoint condition &lt;math&gt;
 p_1=-\frac{\partial E}{\partial q}(q_1)
&lt;/math&gt; and dynamics on the Lagrange multipliers determined by the Gatteux derivative conditions &lt;math&gt;
 (-\dot p - \nabla \cdot (pv) | \delta q) ) =0

&lt;/math&gt; and the state &lt;math&gt;

( \delta p | \dot q + \nabla q \cdot v  ) = 0

Most of the sulfur oxidizers are [[autotroph]]s that can use reduced sulfur species as electron donors for carbon dioxide (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) fixation. The microbial oxidation of sulfur is an important link in the [[Sulfur cycle|biogeochemical cycling of sulfur]] in environments hosting both abundant reduced sulfur species and low concentrations of oxygen, such as marine sediments, oxygen minimum zones (OMZs) and hydrothermal systems.&lt;ref name="Fike_2016"&gt;{{cite book|title=Geomicrobiology of sulfur| vauthors = Fike DA, Bradley AS, Leavitt WD  | publisher=Ehrlich's Geomicrobiology | edition = Sixth |year=2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ecology ==
The oxidation of hydrogen sulfide has been considered one of the most important processes in the environment, given that the oceans have had very low oxygen and high sulfidic conditions over most of the Earth's history. The modern analog ecosystems are deep marine basins such as those in the Black Sea, near the Cariaco trench and the Santa Barbara basin. Other zones of the ocean that experience periodic anoxic and sulfidic conditions are the upwelling zones off the coasts of Chile and Namibia, and hydrothermal vents, which are a key source of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S to the ocean.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Luther|first=George W.|last2=Findlay|first2=Alyssa J.|last3=Macdonald|first3=Daniel J.|last4=Owings|first4=Shannon M.|last5=Hanson|first5=Thomas E.|last6=Beinart|first6=Roxanne A.|last7=Girguis|first7=Peter R.|date=2011|title=Thermodynamics and kinetics of sulfide oxidation by oxygen: a look at inorganically controlled reactions and biologically mediated processes in the environment|journal=Frontiers in Microbiology|volume=2|pages=62|doi=10.3389/fmicb.2011.00062|issn=1664-302X|pmc=3153037|pmid=21833317}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Sulfur oxidizing microorganisms (SOM) are thus restricted to upper sediment layers in these environments, where oxygen and nitrate, which are electron acceptors with high [[redox potential]]s are available.

Given that the maximal concentrations of oxygen, nitrate and sulfide are usually separated in depth profiles, many SOM cannot directly access their energy sources (reduced sulfur species) and electron acceptors at the same time. This limitation has led SOM to develop different morphological adaptations.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The large sulfur bacteria (LSB) of the family ''[[Beggiatoa]]ceae'' ([[Gammaproteobacteria]]) have been used as model organisms for benthic sulfur oxidation. They are known as 'gradient organisms', that are indicative of hypoxic (low oxygen) and sulfidic (rich in reduced sulfur species) conditions. They internally store large amounts of nitrate and elemental sulfur to overcome the spatial gap between oxygen and sulfide. Some of the ''Beggiatoaceae'' are filamentous and can thus glide between oxic/suboxic and sulfidic environments, while the non-motile ones rely on nutrient suspensions, fluxes, or attach themselves to bigger particles.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Some marine non-motile LSB are the only known free-living bacteria that have two carbon fixation pathways: the [[Calvin-Benson cycle]] (used by plants and other photosynthetic organisms) and the reverse [[tricarboxylic acid cycle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Winkel|first=Matthias|last2=Salman-Carvalho|first2=Verena|last3=Woyke|first3=Tanja|last4=Richter|first4=Michael|last5=Schulz-Vogt|first5=Heide N.|last6=Flood|first6=Beverly E.|last7=Bailey|first7=Jake V.|last8=Mußmann|first8=Marc|date=2016|title=Single-cell Sequencing of Thiomargarita Reveals Genomic Flexibility for Adaptation to Dynamic Redox Conditions|url=http://journal.frontiersin.org/Article/10.3389/fmicb.2016.00964/abstract|journal=Frontiers in Microbiology|language=English|volume=7|doi=10.3389/fmicb.2016.00964|issn=1664-302X|pmc=4914600|pmid=27446006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another evolutionary strategy of SOM is to partner up with motile eukaryotic organisms. The symbiotic SOM provides carbon and, in some cases, bioavailable nitrogen to the host, and gets enhanced access to resources and shelter in return.

* The sulfide:quinone oxidorreductase pathway (SQR), widespread in green sulfur bacteria, that involves the formation of intermediate compounds such as [[sulfite]] (SO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2-&lt;/sup&gt;) and [[Adenosine 5´ phosphosulfate|adenosine 5'-phosphosulfate]] (APS),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Beller HR, Chain PS, Letain TE, Chakicherla A, Larimer FW, Richardson PM, Coleman MA, Wood AP, Kelly DP | title = The genome sequence of the obligately chemolithoautotrophic, facultatively anaerobic bacterium Thiobacillus denitrificans | journal = Journal of Bacteriology | volume = 188 | issue = 4 | pages = 1473–88 | date = February 2006 | pmid = 16452431 | pmc = 1367237 | doi = 10.1128/JB.188.4.1473-1488.2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which are known to have a significant oxygen [[isotope]] exchange.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Turchyn|first=Alexandra V.|last2=Brüchert|first2=Volker|last3=Lyons|first3=Timothy W.|last4=Engel|first4=Gregory S.|last5=Balci|first5=Nurgul|last6=Schrag|first6=Daniel P.|last7=Brunner|first7=Benjamin | name-list-format = vanc |date=2010|title=Kinetic oxygen isotope effects during dissimilatory sulfate reduction: A combined theoretical and experimental approach |journal=Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta|volume=74|issue=7|pages=2011–2024|doi=10.1016/j.gca.2010.01.004|issn=0016-7037}}&lt;/ref&gt; The step catalyzed by SQR can also be mediated by a membrane-bound flavocytochrome c-sulfide dehydrogenase (FCSD).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Yamanaka|first=T.|last2=Fukumori|first2=Y.|last3=Okunuki|first3=K.|date=1979|title=Preparation of subunits of flavocytochromes c derived from Chlorobium limicola f. thiosulfatophilum and Chromatium vinosum|journal=Analytical Biochemistry|volume=95|issue=1|pages=209–213|issn=0003-2697|pmid=227287}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, two pathways for the oxidation of sulfite (SO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2-&lt;/sup&gt;) have been identified:

* The rDsr pathway, used by some microorganisms in the [[Chlorobi]] (green sulfur bacteria), [[Alphaproteobacteria|''Alpha'']], [[Betaproteobacteria|Beta]] and ''Gammaproteobacteria'', in which sulfide is oxidized to sulfite by means of a reverse operation of the dissimilatory sulfite reduction (Dsr) pathway. The sulfite generated by rDsr is then oxidized to sulfate by other enzymes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Microbial Sulfur Metabolism|vauthors=Grimm F, Franz B, Dahl C|publisher=Springer-Verlag GmbH|year=2008|veditors=Friedrich C, Dahl C|location=Berlin Heidelberg|pages=101–116|chapter=Thiosulfate and sulfur oxidation in purple sulfur bacteria.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The direct oxidation of sulfite to sulfate by a type of mononuclear molybdenum enzyme known as sulfite oxidoreductase. Three different groups of these enzymes are recognized (the xanthine oxidase, sulfite oxidase (SO) and dimethyl sulfoxide reductase families), and they are present in the three domains of life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kappler|first=U.|last2=Dahl|first2=C.|date=2001-09-11|title=Enzymology and molecular biology of prokaryotic sulfite oxidation|journal=FEMS Microbiology Letters|volume=203|issue=1|pages=1–9|issn=0378-1097|pmid=11557133}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, at least three pathways exist for the oxidation of [[thiosulfate]] (S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2-&lt;/sup&gt;) :

*The aforementioned Sox pathway, through which both sulfur atoms in thiosulfate are reduced to sulfate without the formation of any free intermediate.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
*The oxidation of thiosulfate (S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2-&lt;/sup&gt;)  via the formation of [[tetrathionate]] (S&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2-&lt;/sup&gt;) intermediate, that is present in several obligate chemolithotrophic ''Gamma'' and ''Betaproteobacteria'' as well as in facultative chemolithotrophic ''Alphaproteobacteria''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ghosh|first=Wriddhiman|last2=Dam|first2=Bomba|date=2009|title=Biochemistry and molecular biology of lithotrophic sulfur oxidation by taxonomically and ecologically diverse bacteria and archaea|journal=FEMS microbiology reviews|volume=33|issue=6|pages=999–1043|doi=10.1111/j.1574-6976.2009.00187.x|issn=1574-6976|pmid=19645821}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The branched thiosulfate oxidation pathway, a mechanism in which water-insoluble globules of intermediate sulfur are formed during the oxidation of thiosulfate and sulfide. It is present in all the anoxygenic photolithotrophic green and purple sulfur bacteria, and the free-living as well as symbiotic strains of certain sulfur-chemolithotrophic bacteria.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dahl, C., Rákhely, G., Pott-Sperling, A.

In any of these pathways, oxygen is the preferred [[electron acceptor]], but in oxygen-limited environments [[nitrate]], oxidized forms of iron and even organic matter are used instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Rivett MO, Buss SR, Morgan P, Smith JW, Bemment CD | title = Nitrate attenuation in groundwater: a review of biogeochemical controlling processes | journal = Water Research | volume = 42 | issue = 16 | pages = 4215–32 | date = October 2008 | pmid = 18721996 | doi = 10.1016/j.watres.2008.07.020 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cyanobacteria normally perform oxygenic photosynthesis using water as electron donor. However, in the presence of sulfide, oxygenic photosynthesis is inhibited, and some cyanobacteria can perform anoxygenic photosynthesis by oxidation of sulfide to thiosulfate − using [[Photosystem I]] with sulfite− as a possible intermediate sulfur compound.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wit|first=Rutger|last2=Gemerden|first2=Hans | name-list-format = vanc |date=1987|title=Oxidation of sulfide to thiosulfate by Microcoleus chtonoplastes |journal=FEMS Microbiology Letters|volume=45|issue=1|pages=7–13|doi=10.1111/j.1574-6968.1987.tb02332.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Rabenstein A, Rethmeier J, Fischer U | date=2014|title=Sulphite as Intermediate Sulphur Compound in Anaerobic Sulphide Oxidation to Thiosulphate by Marine Cyanobacteria |journal=Zeitschrift für Naturforschung C|volume=50 | issue = 11–12 | pages = 769–774 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Oxidation of sulfide  ===
Sulfide oxidation can proceed under aerobic or anaerobic conditions. Aerobic sulfide-oxidizing bacteria usually oxidize sulfide to sulfate and are obligate or facultative chemolithoautotrophs. The latter can grow as [[heterotroph]]s, obtaining carbon from organic sources, or as autotrophs, using sulfide as the electron donor (energy source) for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; fixation.&lt;ref name="Fike_2016" /&gt; The oxidation of sulfide can proceed aerobically by two different mechanisms: [[substrate-level phosphorylation]], which is dependent on [[adenosine monophosphate]] (AMP), and [[oxidative phosphorylation]] independent of AMP,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | chapter = Chemolithotrophy | vauthors = Wood P | veditors = Anthony C | title = Bacterial Energy Transduction | location = London, U.K. | publisher = Academic Press | pages = 183–230 |year=1988 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which has been detected in several ''Thiobacilli'' (''T. denitrificans'', ''T. thioparus, T. novellus'' and ''T. neapolitanus''), as well as in ''Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The biochemistry of inorganic compounds of sulphur. | vauthors = Roy AB, Trudinger PA | publisher=Cambridge University Press.|year=1970 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The archaeon ''Acidianus ambivalens'' appears to possess both an ADP-dependent and an ADP independent pathway for the oxidation of sulfide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Zimmermann P, Laska S, Kletzin A | title = Two modes of sulfite oxidation in the extremely thermophilic and acidophilic archaeon acidianus ambivalens | journal = Archives of Microbiology | volume = 172 | issue = 2 | pages = 76–82 | date = August 1999 | pmid = 10415168 | doi = 10.1007/s002030050743 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, both mechanisms operate in the chemoautotroph ''Thiobacillus denitrificans'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Aminuddin M | title = Substrate level versus oxidative phosphorylation in the generation of ATP in Thiobacillus denitrificans | journal = Archives of Microbiology | volume = 128 | issue = 1 | pages = 19–25 | date = November 1980 | pmid = 7458535 | doi = 10.1007/BF00422300 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which can oxidize sulfide to sulfate anaerobically using nitrate as terminal electron acceptor &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Aminuddin M, Nicholas DJ |date=1974|title=Electron Transfer during Sulphide and Sulphite Oxidation in Thiobacillus denitrificans |journal=Microbiology|volume=82|issue=1|pages=115–123|doi=10.1099/00221287-82-1-115}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is in turn reduced to dinitrogen (N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Aminuddin M, Nicholas DJ | title = Sulphide oxidation linked to the reduction of nitrate and nitrite in Thiobacillus denitrificans | journal = Biochimica et Biophysica Acta | volume = 325 | issue = 1 | pages = 81–93 | date = October 1973 | pmid = 4770733 | doi = 10.1016/0005-2728(73)90153-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Two other anaerobic strains that can perform a similar process were identified as similar to ''Thiomicrospira denitrificans'' and ''Arcobacter''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gevertz D, Telang AJ, Voordouw G, Jenneman GE | title = Isolation and characterization of strains CVO and FWKO B, two novel nitrate-reducing, sulfide-oxidizing bacteria isolated from oil field brine | journal = Applied and Environmental Microbiology | volume = 66 | issue = 6 | pages = 2491–501 | date = June 2000 | pmid = 10831429 | pmc = 110567 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the heterotrophic SOB are included species of ''Beggiatoa'' that can grow mixotrophically, using sulfide to obtain energy (autotrophic metabolism) or to eliminate metabolically formed hydrogen peroxide in the absence of catalase (heterotrophic metabolism).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Burton SD, Morita RY | title = Effect of Catalase and Cultural Conditions on Growth of Beggiatoa | journal = Journal of Bacteriology | volume = 88 | pages = 1755–61 | date = December 1964 | pmid = 14240966 | pmc = 277482 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other organisms, such as the Bacteria ''Sphaerotilus natans'' &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Skerman VB, Dementjeva G, Carey BJ | title = Intracellular deposition of sulfur by Sphaerotilus natans | journal = Journal of Bacteriology | volume = 73 | issue = 4 | pages = 504–12 | date = April 1957 | pmid = 13428683 | pmc = 314609 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the yeast ''Alternaria'' &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Skerman VB, Dementjev G, Skyring GW | title = Deposition of sulphur from hydrogen sulphide by bacteria and yeast | journal = Nature | volume = 179 | issue = 4562 | pages = 742 | date = April 1957 | pmid = 13418779 | doi = 10.1038/179742a0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; are able to oxidize sulfide to elemental sulfur by means of the rDsr pathway.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Belousova EV, Chernousova EI, Dubinina GA, Turova TP, Grabovich MI | title = [Detection and analysis of sulfur metabolism genes in Sphaerotilus natans subsp. sulfidivorans representatives] | journal = Mikrobiologiia | volume = 82 | issue = 5 | pages = 579–87 | date = 2013 | pmid = 25509396 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Oxidation of elemental sulfur ===
Some Bacteria and Archaea can aerobically oxidize elemental sulfur to sulfuric acid.&lt;ref name="Fike_2016" /&gt; ''Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans'' and ''Thiobacillus thioparus'' can oxidize sulfur to sulfide by means of an oxygenase enzyme, although it is thought that an oxidase could be used as well as an energy saving mechanism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Suzuki I, Silver M | title = The initial product and properties of the sulfur-oxidizing enzyme of thiobacilli | journal = Biochimica et Biophysica Acta | volume = 122 | issue = 1 | pages = 22–33 | date = July 1966 | pmid = 5968172 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For the anaerobic oxidation of elemental sulfur, it is thought that the Sox pathway plays an important role, although this is not yet completely understood.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Friedrich CG, Rother D, Bardischewsky F, Quentmeier A, Fischer J | title = Oxidation of reduced inorganic sulfur compounds by bacteria: emergence of a common mechanism? | journal = Applied and Environmental Microbiology | volume = 67 | issue = 7 | pages = 2873–82 | date = July 2001 | pmid = 11425697 | pmc = 92956 | doi = 10.1128/AEM.67.7.2873-2882.2001 | url = http://aem.asm.org/content/67/7/2873 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Thiobacillus denitrificans'' uses oxidized forms on nitrogen as terminal electron acceptor instead of oxygen, and ''A. ferrooxidans'' uses ferrous iron.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Brock TD, Gustafson J | title = Ferric iron reduction by sulfur- and iron-oxidizing bacteria | journal = Applied and Environmental Microbiology | volume = 32 | issue = 4 | pages = 567–71 | date = October 1976 | pmid = 825043 | pmc = 170307 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Oxidation of thiosulfate and tetrathionate ===
Most of the chemosynthetic autotrophic bacteria that can oxidize elemental sulfur to sulfate are also able to oxidize thiosulfate to sulfate as a source of reducing power for carbon dioxide assimilation. However, the mechanisms that they utilize may vary, since some of them, such as the photosynthetic purple bacteria, transiently accumulate extracellular elemental sulfur during the oxidation of tetrathionate before oxidizing it to sulfate, while the green sulfur bacteria do not.&lt;ref name="Fike_2016" /&gt; A direct oxidation reaction (''T. versutus'' &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lu W-P.|first=|date=1986|title=A periplasmic location for the bisulfiteoxidizing multienzyme system from Thiobacillus versutus.|url=|journal=FEMS Microbiol Lett|volume=34|pages=313–317.}}&lt;/ref&gt;), as well as others that involve sulfite (''T. denitrificans'') and tetrathionate (''A. ferrooxidans'', ''A. thiooxidans'' and ''Acidiphilum acidophilum'' &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pronk|first=J|date=1990|title=Oxidation of reduced inorganic sulphur compounds by acidophilic thiobacilli|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/0378-1097(90)90540-7|journal=FEMS Microbiology Letters|volume=75|issue=2-3|pages=293–306|doi=10.1016/0378-1097(90)90540-7|issn=0378-1097}}&lt;/ref&gt;'')'' as intermediate compounds, have been proposed. Some mixotrophic bacteria only oxidize thiosulfate to tetrathionate.&lt;ref name="Fike_2016" /&gt;

The mechanism of bacterial oxidation of tetrathionate is still unclear and may involve sulfur [[disproportionation]], during which both [[sulfide]] and [[sulfate]] are produced from reduced sulfur species, and hydrolysis reactions.&lt;ref name="Fike_2016" /&gt;

== Isotope fractionations ==
The [[Isotope fractionation|fractionation]] of [[sulfur]] and [[oxygen]] [[isotope]]s during microbial [[sulfide]] oxidation (MSO) has been studied to assess its potential as a proxy to differentiate it from the abiotic oxidation of [[sulfur]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Knöller K, Vogt C, Feisthauer S, Weise SM, Weiss H, Richnow HH|date=November 2008|title=Sulfur cycling and biodegradation in contaminated aquifers: insights from stable isotope investigations|journal=Environmental Science &amp; Technology|volume=42|issue=21|pages=7807–12|pmid=19031864}}&lt;/ref&gt; The light isotopes of the elements that are most commonly found in organic molecules, such as &lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;C, &lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt;O, &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H, &lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;N and &lt;sup&gt;32&lt;/sup&gt;S, form bonds that are broken more easily than bonds between the corresponding heavy isotopes, &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C, &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O, &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;H, &lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;N and &lt;sup&gt;34&lt;/sup&gt;S . Because there is a lower energetic cost associated with the use of light isotopes, enzymatic processes usually discriminate against the heavy isotopes, and, as a consequence, biological [[Isotope fractionation|fractionations of isotopes]] are expected between the reactants and the products. A normal [[kinetic isotope effect]] is that in which the products are depleted in the heavy isotope relative to the reactants (low heavy isotope to light isotope ratio), and although this is not always the case, the study of isotope fractionations between enzymatic processes may allow tracing the source of the product.

=== Fractionation of oxygen isotopes ===
The formation of [[sulfate]] in aerobic conditions entails the incorporation of four oxygen atoms from water, and when coupled with [[dissimilatory nitrate reduction]] (DNR) -the preferential reduction pathway under anoxic conditions- can have a contribution of [[oxygen]] atoms from [[nitrate]] as well. The δ&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O value of the newly formed sulfate thus depends on the δ&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O value of the water, the isotopic fractionation associated with the incorporation of oxygen atoms from water to [[sulfate]] and a potential exchange of oxygen atoms between sulfur and nitrogen intermediates and water.&lt;ref name="Poser_2014"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Poser A, Vogt C, Knöller K, Ahlheim J, Weiss H, Kleinsteuber S, Richnow HH | title = Stable sulfur and oxygen isotope fractionation of anoxic sulfide oxidation by two different enzymatic pathways | journal = Environmental Science &amp; Technology | volume = 48 | issue = 16 | pages = 9094–102 | date = August 2014 | pmid = 25003498 | doi = 10.1021/es404808r }}&lt;/ref&gt; MSO has been found to produce small fractionations in &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O compared to water (~5‰). Given the very small fractionation of &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O that usually accompanies MSO, the relatively higher depletions in &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O of the sulfate produced by MSO coupled to DNR (-1.8 to -8.5 ‰)  suggest a [[kinetic isotope effect]] in the incorporation of oxygen from water to [[sulfate]] and the role of [[nitrate]] as a potential alternative source of light oxygen.&lt;ref name="Poser_2014" /&gt; The fractionations of oxygen produced by sulfur disproportionation from elemental sulfur have been found to be higher, with reported values from 8 to 18.4‰, which suggests a kinetic isotope effect in the pathways involved in oxidation of elemental sulfur to sulfate, although more studies are necessary to determine what are the specific steps and conditions that favor this fractionation. The table below summarizes the reported fractionations of oxygen isotopes from MSO in different organisms and conditions.

=== Fractionation of sulfur isotopes  ===
Aerobic MSO generates depletions in the &lt;sup&gt;34&lt;/sup&gt;S of sulfate, that have been found to be as small as −1.5‰ and as large as -18‰. For most microorganisms and oxidation conditions, only small fractionations accompany either the aerobic or anaerobic oxidation of sulfide, elemental sulfur, thiosulfate and sulfite to elemental sulfur or sulfate. The phototrophic oxidation of sulfide to thiosulfate under anoxic conditions also generates negligible fractionations. In the chemolithotrophs ''Thiobacillus denitrificans'' and ''Sulfurimonas denitrificans'', MSO coupled to DNR has the effect of inducing the SQR and Sox pathways, respectively. In both cases, a small fractionation in the &lt;sup&gt;34&lt;/sup&gt;S of the sulfate, lower than -4.3‰, has been measured. [[Sulfate]] depletion in &lt;sup&gt;34&lt;/sup&gt;S from MSO could be used to trace [[sulfide]] oxidation processes in the environment, although it does not allow a discrimination between the SQR and Sox pathways.&lt;ref name="Poser_2014" /&gt;  The depletion produced by MSO coupled to DNR is similar to up to -5‰ depletion estimated for the &lt;sup&gt;34&lt;/sup&gt;S in the sulfide produced from rDsr.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Brunner|first=Benjamin|last2=Bernasconi|first2=Stefano M.|last3=Kleikemper|first3=Jutta|last4=Schroth|first4=Martin H. | name-list-format = vanc |date=2005|title=A model for oxygen and sulfur isotope fractionation in sulfate during bacterial sulfate reduction processes |journal=Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta|volume=69|issue=20|pages=4773–4785|doi=10.1016/j.gca.2005.04.017|issn=0016-7037}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Brunner|first=Benjamin|last2=Bernasconi|first2=Stefano M.| name-list-format = vanc |date=2005|title=A revised isotope fractionation model for dissimilatory sulfate reduction in sulfate reducing bacteria |journal=Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta|volume=69|issue=20|pages=4759–4771|doi=10.1016/j.gca.2005.04.015|issn=0016-7037}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In contrast, disproportionation under anaerobic conditions generates sulfate enriched in &lt;sup&gt;34&lt;/sup&gt;S up to 9‰ and ~34‰ from sulfide and elemental sulfur, respectively. Just as the fractionation of oxygen isotopes reveal, the larger fractionations in sulfate from the disproportionation of elemental sulfur point to a key step or pathway critical for inducing this large kinetic isotope effect. The table below summarizes the reported fractionations of sulfur isotopes from MSO in different organisms and conditions.

{{no footnotes|date=March 2013}}
:''For other nations' naval work divers, see [[Clearance Diver]].''
'''Minentaucher''' (Mine Clearance Divers) are particularly trained military divers of the [[German Navy]]. Their operational areas are:
*Searching, identifying, and removing or salvaging underwater weapons such as [[naval mine|mines]] or explosives in the water.
*Servicing underwater [[Remotely operated vehicle|drone]]s.
*Removing weapons in water and ashore, in particular removing explosives attached by enemies to hulls and underwater equipment.
*Rescuing and salvaging.
Mine Clearance Divers are highly qualified specialists, who are stationed partly on board ''schwimmenden Einheiten'' (= "swimming units"), which can be ordered to be in standby if necessary. A part of the trained mine clearance divers is available as a special-purpose force in the mine clearance diver company in [[Eckernförde]].

In 2001 the ''Bataillon Spezialisierter Kräfte'' (= "Battalion of Specialized Forces") was separated from the [[German commando frogmen]] group.

The ''Bataillon Spezialisierter Kräfte'' (SEK M) (= "Specialized Task Forces Battalion" was formed by the transformation of 2003. SEK M was divided further into the ''Kampfschwimmerkompanie'' (= "[[German commando frogmen|combat diver company]]", one mine clearance diver company, and two naval companies for special employments (e.g. [[Boarding (attack)|boarding]] ships), a training inspection, and further support elements. On 1 April 2014 the Minentaucherkompanie became an integral part of the newly formed [[Naval Force Protection Battalion]] (''Seebataillon'').&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marine.de/portal/a/marine/!ut/p/c4/NYo7DsJADAVvZO9SBEFHSAEp00DoTGJFFvuJLAcaDs9uwRtpmnn4wEKityxkkhMFvOM4yfH5gUgK9LKNQ2C81d_MMOXEVm2cTIoXJcsKa1YLtWyqpYDMODrftW7v_vPfw2Xod-fGN921HXCN8fQDL1Gj9A!!/ Das „Multitool“ der Marine - Seebataillon in Eckernförde aufgestellt]&lt;/ref&gt;

See [[:de:Bild:MiTa Wappen.JPG]] for the coat of arms of the Minentaucherkompanie.

==Training==
The mine clearance divers are trained in the mine clearance diver company (MiTaKp) in [[Eckernförde]]. This unit is subordinated to the ''Flottille Minenstreitkräfte'' (= "flotilla of mine armed forces").

==Entrance requirements==
To qualify for armed divers diver training, which includes mine clearance divers and combat frogmen, these conditions are to be fulfilled:-

Examination without restriction
*Serving as a soldier on a timed contract "Soldat auf Zeit" for at least 4 years or as a career soldier.
*Completing the basic training at a naval school;.
*Undergo the TuKV (diver and combat frogman suitability) examination at the Schiffahrtsmedizinisches Institut (= Shipping-medical Institute) in [[Kiel]].
*Top condition (physical fitness), which is examined in special tests before and during the training.
*Strength of will, which makes the applicant loadable over the borders of reflexes and physical pain.

They are taught much more about diving physics and medicine than a sport diver or civilian work  diver is taught, and knowledge about (any kind of) underwater weapons, tactics and employment procedure. This forms the largest part of the training practical exercises, Fitness training and associated "sifting out" weeds out over 70% of the course participant in the first 6 weeks of the mine clearance diver training.

See [[:de:Bild:Schwimmtaucher.jpg]] for the German armed forces diver badge.

*42: Use as mine clearance diver boat man or officer on board [[mine hunter]]s, in the MiTaKP or in [[Explosive Ordnance Disposal|EOD]]/[[IEDD]] groups in the SEK M as combat [[frogman]]

==Armed forces diver==
Armed forces divers are trained and used in nearly all countries as part of its navy.
* In the USA they are the [[United States Navy EOD|EOD]].
* In Great Britain their training is merged in the [[Special Boat Service]] (SBS).
* In France the unit of the Plongeurs Démineurs is comparable to the German mine clearance divers.
In all countries the employments, operating conditions and employment regulations of the weapon divers are subject to secrecy.

Combat frogmen and mine clearance divers differ clearly in their equipment, due to their different tasks.

===Combat frogmen===
Combat [[frogmen]] (Kampfschwimmer) operate offshore undiscovered and in shallow water, but mine clearance divers are used also in lakes and partly into deeper water. The preferred diving equipment of the combat frogmen is accordingly oxygen [[rebreather]]s, which reprocesses breathed out air and delivers only small masses of gas to the environment, so that the combat frogman cannot be discovered by rising bubbles. See also [[German commando frogmen]].

===Mine clearance diver===
Clearance divers use either compressed air or mixed gas devices. With "[[rebreather|oxygen cycle devices]]" the depth is limited to {{convert|15|–|20|m|ft}}; with "[[aqua-lung|compressed air diving devices]]", which are used also in sport diving, the depth is {{convert|40|–|60|m|ft}}; with "mixed gas devices" with [[Trimix (breathing gas)|trimixes]] the oxygen portion according to the depth is reduced, thus the possible depth is higher.

Since 2002 their [[scuba set|compressed air diving devices]] "FTG" were replaced by computer-controlled mixture [[rebreathers]] called "Stealth".

Apart from the mechanical and electronic special tools used by mine clearance divers, items of equipment are used which are also used by civilian divers.

==Diving safety==
The mine clearance diver boat ''Mūhlhausen'' (replacement for the ''Stier'' which was decommissioned in 1994) and the diver school boat ''Langeoog'' (replacement for the ''ansa'') in [[Eckernförde]] have stationary [[decompression chamber]]s for up to 6 persons, in which divers can be treated immediately after accidents. To these, mobile [[decompression chamber]]s can be clamped on by flanges. They are transported if necessary (e.g. by SAR helicopters in low-altitude flight) to [[Kiel]], to the largest pressure chamber of the German Federal Navy, in which up to 12 people can be subjected to pressure, as a simulation of deep diving as part of training, or to treat [[decompression sickness]]. For this reason and due to the outstanding training, the number and the consequences of serious and deadly diving accidents with the mine clearance divers in the German navy are remarkably small compared to the comparable units in other countries.{{cn|date=November 2017}}

A component of the training is the Armed Forces boat driving licence and the training about naval underwater explosives. Afterwards the training takes place to troop leader in the context of the ship safeguard training.

The members of the MiTaKp can participate in numerous special training courses beyond that. Most longer-serving mine clearance divers are qualified e.g. also as motorists BCE, helmet divers (nationally examined diver), the parachutist, and single fighter.{{clarify|reason=what is single fighter?|date=November 2017}}

The training and operational planning was aimed originally to defend against conventional and more unconventional underwater weapons in case of emergency in a possible confrontation of [[NATO]] with the [[Eastern Bloc]]. Since 1985 the tasks and course contents were modified accordingly. The training in removal of unorthodox exploding and fire devices ([[IEDD]]) still takes place in a "special training course for the fulfilment of special orders for employment".

==Employments==
Mine clearance divers were predominantly used from 1957 to 1984 in German territorial waters, mainly in the [[Baltic Sea]] and removing naval mines left over from wars. Also they joined in search and salvage of damaged ships, submarines and fallen airplanes. The most dangerous task of the mine clearance divers consisted of seeking out and salvaging weapons, which were sunk after the World War in the [[Baltic Sea]], containing chemical agents and therefore today endangering [[navigation]] and [[fishery]].

Removing freshly laid mines in autumn 1985 in the [[Suez Canal]] was the first exterritorial use of German mine clearance divers. With this NATO employment in an international maritime route, with which the clearing equipment (Troika), developed for open ocean, could not be used, German mine clearance divers were used. Afterwards numerous employments took place worldwide also in international waters with NATO Response Forces and the German task Force (EAV).

==Unit information==
The Mine clearance diver company badge is a [[sawfish]].
*The [[slogan]] of the mine clearance divers is "''Nec aspera terrent''" (= "Adversities do not frighten" (flag saying of the [[Hannover]] army 1617 - 1866)).
*Unit symbols are:-
**The combat frogmen: a [[linen]] boot.
**The mine clearance divers (as [[coat of arms]]): a [[sawfish]] in front of a horned mine.
**The mine clearance divers (as [[badge]]): an [[octopus]] examining a horned mine
*There are about 40 active German mine clearance divers in the MiTaKp, and about 60 active on board "swimming units" and in the ports.

The MIASE project was launched in 2007 by Dagmar Köhn and Nicolas Le Novère and first presented on the [http://sbml.org/Events/Workshops/The_12th_SBML_Forum_Meeting 12th SBML Forum Meeting] in October 2007. Since then, MIASE was discussed on various meetings, not only within the SBML community. MIASE has become a community effort involving people from various standardisation communities as well as developers of simulation tools.
In April 2009, MIASE was part of the "[[CellML]], [[SBGN]], [[Systems Biology Ontology|SBO]], [[BioPAX]], and MIASE [http://www.cellml.org/community/events/workshop/2009 Super-Workshop 2009]".

== The guidelines ==
The MIASE Guidelines are composed of the following parts: Information about the models to use, information about the simulation steps, and Information about the output:

=== Information about the models to use ===
All models used in the experiment must be identified, accessible, and fully described.
# The description of the simulation experiment must be provided together with the models necessary for the experiment, or with a precise and unambiguous way of accessing those models.
# The models required for the simulations must be provided with all governing equations, parameter values, and necessary conditions (initial state and/or boundary conditions).
# If a model is not encoded in a standard format, then the model code must be made available to the user. If a model is not encoded in an open format or code, its full description must be provided, sufficient to re-implement it.
# Any modification of a model (pre-processing) required before the execution of a step of the simulation experiment must be described.

=== Information about the simulation steps ===
A precise description of the simulation steps and other procedures used by the experiment must be provided.
# All simulation steps must be clearly described, including the simulation algorithms to be used, the models on which to apply each simulation, the order of the simulation steps, and the data processing to be done between the simulation steps.
# All information needed for the correct implementation of the necessary simulation steps must be included through precise descriptions or references to unambiguous information sources.
# If a simulation step is performed using a computer program for which source code is not available, all information needed to reproduce the simulation, and not just repeat it, must be provided, including the algorithms used by the original software and any information necessary to implement them, such as the discretization and integration methods.
# If it is known that a simulation step will produce different results when performed in a different simulation environment or on a different computational platform, an explanation must be given of how the model has to be run with the specified environment/platform in order to achieve the purpose of the experiment.

=== Information about the output ===
All information necessary to obtain the desired numerical results must be provided.
# All post-processing steps applied on the raw numerical results of simulation steps in order to generate the final results have to be described in detail. That includes the identification of data to process, the order in which changes were applied, and also the nature of changes.
# If the expected insights depend on the relation between different results, such as a plot of one against another, the results to be compared have to be specified.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6130">'''Neo-geo''' or '''neo-geometric conceptualism''' is an art movement that utilizes geometric abstraction and criticizes the industrialism and consumerism of modern society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Neo-geo | url=http://www.tate.org.uk/art/art-terms/n/neo-geo}}&lt;/ref&gt; The usage of the term neo-geo began when it was first used in reference to a 1968 exhibition at the [[Sonnabend Gallery]] in SoHo that included the artwork of Bickerton, Halley, Koons, and Vaisman.&lt;ref name="Williams"&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1093/gao/9781884446054.article.t2214057|title=Neo-Geo|journal=Oxford Art Online|year=2011|last1=Williams|first1=Tom|volume=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The exhibition marked the beginning of a new art movement. According to artist Michael Young, Neo-geo artwork recognizes technology as both a promise and a threat.&lt;ref name="Williams"/&gt;

== Naming ==
Curators, acquisitors, and artists within the movement could not come to an agreement on the name of the movement, leaving the world with more than one name for the art movement. A pair of curators and writers, Tricia Collins and Richard Milazzo, felt that “Post-Conceptualism” was the best fitting term, as it highlighted the magnification of ideas. Many artists within the movement, such as Peter Halley, rejected the name “Neo-Geo” because it seemed too catchy and therefore consumerist. Halley preferred the term “Simulationism” because it referred technology replacing nature.&lt;ref name="Williams"/&gt;  

In the 1987 New York Times newspaper article, “What Do You Call Art’s Newest Trend: ‘Neo-Geo’...Maybe”, he explains that “air conditioning is a simulation of air; movies are a simulation of life; life is simulated by bio-mechanical manipulations”. On the other hand, Eugene Schwartz, an acquisitor, dubbed the movement “Post-Abstract Abstraction” – a new version of 1960s abstraction that creates alternative meanings in unprecedented space. Peter Nagy, artist, wished for the movement to be untitled. He believed that once you give art a name, the movement is destroyed. Some critics even pondered whether the movement had enough originality to be singled out as its own movement, as it bore too many similarities to prior movements such as Expressionism and Pop-Art.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=What Do You Call Art's Newest Trend: 'Neo-Geo' . . . Maybe|last=Glueck|first=Grace|date=July 6, 1987|work=New York Times|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Influences ==
Neo-geo artwork was influenced by earlier movements of the twentieth century, including [[minimalism]], [[pop art]], and [[op art]]. Minimalism began in the 1960s and was focused on including only the necessary elements and geometric abstraction. Pop art began in the 1950s and utilized elements from popular culture such as advertisements and comic books. Pop art was often constructed in a collage-like manner, combining appropriated items from different contexts in order to create a new message. Lastly, op art was a term developed in the 1960s to describe the movement of optical illusions using shapes. The illusions provided the viewer with a warped vision or a hidden image.

Additionally, ideas about postmodernism and hyperreality inspired those within the neo-geo movement. Many neo-geo artists were influenced by French thinker [[Jean Baudrillard]]. Baudrillard’s published books include his opinion on consumerism. One of his arguments is that needs are constructed rather than natural. According to [http://www.tate.org.uk/art/art-terms/n/neo-geo Tate]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/art/art-terms/n/neo-geo|title=Neo-geo – Art Term {{!}} Tate|last=Tate|work=Tate|access-date=2018-02-18|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;, Geometry was a way in which artists represented ideas like Jean Baudrillard’s, with geometry as a metaphor for the modern world because shapes are constructed.

== Neogeo Research ==
Art historian and curator Brandt provides the first comprehensive survey of neogeo artists. Artists surveyed include Sherrie Levine, Allan McCollum, Haim Steinbach, Jeff Koons, Peter Halley, Ashley Bickerton, and Meyer Vaisman. Brandt focuses on their artistic perspective, examining each artists' exposure to structuralist and poststructuralist theory. Other topics covered include East Village culture in the 1980s and influence of postwar French theory. Brandt also connects each artists' works to pop art, minimalism, conceptualism, and the pictures group.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/867001103|title=Interplay : neo-geo [crossed out] neoconceptual art of the 1980s|last=1978-|first=Brandt, Amy L.,|isbn=9780262027533|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|oclc=867001103}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[computer network]] research, '''network simulation''' is a technique whereby a software program models the behavior of a network by calculating the interaction between the different network entities (routers, switches, nodes, access points, links etc.). Most simulators use discrete event simulation - the modeling of systems in which state variables change at discrete points in time.  The behavior of the network and the various applications and services it supports can then be observed in a test lab; various attributes of the environment can also be modified in a controlled manner to assess how the network / protocols would behave under different conditions.

==Network simulator==
A '''network simulator''' is [[software]] that predicts the behavior of a [[computer network]]. Since communication networks have become too complex for traditional analytical methods to provide an accurate understanding of system behavior, network simulators are used. In simulators, the computer network is  modeled with devices, links, applications etc. and the network performance is reported. Simulators come with support for the most popular technologies and networks in use today such as [[Wireless LAN|Wireless LANs]], [[Mobile ad hoc network|mobile ad hoc networks]], [[Wireless sensor network|wireless sensor networks]], [[Vehicular ad hoc network|vehicular ad hoc networks]], [[Cognitive Radio Networks|cognitive radio networks]], [[LTE (telecommunication)|LTE]] / LTE- [[5G]], [[Internet of things|Internet of Things]] (IoT) etc.

==Simulations==
Most of the commercial [[Simulation|simulators]] are [[GUI]] driven, while some network simulators are [[Command-line interface|CLI]] driven. The network model / configuration describes the network (nodes, routers, switches, links) and the events (data transmissions, packet error etc.). Output results would include network level metrics, link metrics, device metrics etc. Further, drill down in terms of simulations [[tracing (software)|trace]] files would also be available. Trace files log every packet, every event that occurred in the simulation and are used for analysis. Most network simulators use [[discrete event simulation]], in which a list of pending "events" is stored, and those events are processed in order, with some events triggering future events—such as the event of the arrival of a packet at one node triggering the event of the arrival of that packet at a [[Downstream (networking)|downstream]] node.&lt;section end=transclusionLabelG20170307T1400GMT1 /&gt;

==Network emulation==
[[Network emulation]] allows users to introduce real devices and applications into a test network (simulated) that alters packet flow in such a way as to mimic the behavior of a live network. Live traffic can pass through the simulator and be affected by objects within the simulation.

The typical methodology is that real packets from a live application are sent to the emulation server (where the virtual network is simulated). The real packet gets 'modulated' into a simulation packet. The simulation packet gets demodulated into a real packet after experiencing effects of loss, errors, delay, [[jitter]] etc., thereby transferring these network effects into the real packet. Thus it is as-if the real packet flowed through a real network but in reality it flowed through the simulated network.

Emulation is widely used in the design stage for validating communication networks prior to deployment.

==List of network simulators==
There are both free/open-source and proprietary network simulators available. Examples of notable network simulators / emulators include:  
&lt;!-- Only add simulators that have a wp article, and are mentioned in many research papers. Search at http://scholar.google.com. Do not add external links here. --&gt;
* [[OPNET]] 
*[https://www.tetcos.com TETCOS NetSim]

Both commercial tools are available at deeply discounted prices to universities for network lab experimentation and network R&amp;D.

==Uses of network simulators ==
Network simulators provide a cost-effective method for

*[[Network planning and design|Network design]] validation for enterprises / data centers / sensor networks etc.&lt;br /&gt;
*Network R &amp; D (More than 70% of all Network Research paper reference a network simulator) {{Citation needed|reason=Unable to verify this|date=August 2017}}&lt;br /&gt; 
*Defense applications such as HF / UHF / VHF Radio based MANET Radios, Naval communications, Tactical data links etc. &lt;br /&gt; 
*LTE, LTE-Adv, IOT, VANET simulations &lt;br/&gt;
*Education - Lab experimentation and R &amp; D. Most universities use a network simulator for teaching / R &amp; D since its too expensive to buy hardware equipment &lt;br/&gt; 

There are a wide variety of network simulators, ranging from the very simple to the very complex.  Minimally, a network simulator must enable a user to

*Model the [[network topology]] specifying the nodes on the network and the links between those nodes &lt;br /&gt;
*Model the application flow (traffic) between the nodes&lt;br /&gt;
*Providing network performance metrics as output&lt;br /&gt;
*Visualization of the packet flow&lt;br /&gt;
*Technology / protocol evaluation and device designs &lt;br /&gt;
*Logging of packet/events for drill down analyses / debugging

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2964">'''Noddy headshots''' or '''noddies ''' are a type of camera shot used in recorded news or current affairs interviews. The noddies consist of nods and other similar "listening gestures" made by the interviewer. If only one camera is available at the interview site, then these shots are recorded after the actual interview takes place. The shots are spliced into the interview during the editing process to mask any cuts that have been made. This editing technique is universally "read" by audiences as expressing realism and therefore creates the illusion of a seamless dialogue in the interview.

The earliest use of the term recorded by the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' dates from 1982.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia|title=noddy, ''n''.&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; |encyclopedia=Oxford English Dictionary |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2012 |edition=online  |url=http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/240498?result=6&amp;rskey=EX8zqe&amp; }} {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was explained more fully by [[John Fiske (media scholar)|John Fiske]] in 1987: "the camera is then turned onto the interviewer who asks some of the questions again and gives a series of "noddies," that is, reaction shots, nods, smiles, or expressions of sympathetic listening. These are then used to disguise later edits in the interviewee's speech... Without the "noddy", the visuals would show an obvious "jump" that would reveal the edit."&lt;ref&gt;Fiske 1987, p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Controversial use ==

In the United Kingdom, the term came to public prominence in 2007 when it was revealed that a BBC programme inserted noddies featuring the senior broadcaster [[Alan Yentob]] into interviews that he did not conduct, creating the impression that he had been present.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/media/2007/sep/07/bbc.television1&lt;/ref&gt; This controversy, which was covered in many newspapers as ''Noddygate'', came at a time when the BBC was already under scrutiny for falsifying certain aspects of entertainment shows for editorial reasons.

'''Pancar Merah''' is an [[Islamic talisman]] found among the [[Banjar people]] from South Borneo.&lt;ref&gt;Urang Banjar dan kebudayaannya Author:	M Suriansyah Ideham, Pemerintah {{ISBN|9786022583387}}, p.51&lt;/ref&gt;
It is used to protect and defend the bearer when dealing with people of high status such are tribal leaders or kings.&lt;ref&gt;M. Nur, Maksum and Fahmy, Al Amruzi and Nor, Ipansyah: Jimat Dalam Konsep Magis Masyarakat Banjar, p.38&lt;/ref&gt;

Pancar Merah has a circular shape with a diameter of 50-70 mm, it is made from silver, copper, silver plated copper or brass and is richly engraved on both sides with Arabic scripts.
On the front side a Pancar Merah is usually engraved with the [[99 Names of Allah]] (Al Asma Ul Husna) and the back side is engraved in accordance with the wishes of the talisman`s orderer (fortune, charisma, security, love or similar).

Pancar Merah is made by a skilled person with a high spiritual level, usually a kyai (ulama, sheikh), and it is crafted only in certain times or periods before or after praying or fasting.

The most notable pieces of Pancar Merah were made in desa (village) Dalam Pagar near [[Martapura, South Kalimantan]], Indonesia before World War II.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7525">'''Preservation of meaning''' in library, archival or museum collections involves understanding spiritual, ritual, or cultural perceptions of value for specific objects, and ensuring these values are maintained and respected.  Meaning is something assigned to objects of cultural or spiritual significance based on interpretations and perceived values by user populations, a process known as social construction of an object (Barker, 77).  When moved to [[memory institution]]s such as libraries or museums, these objects of social construction require unique approaches to preservation and maintenance in order to remain relevant as representations of cultural or spiritual societies.

In many memory institutions of the Western World, including libraries and museums, focus is often placed on the informational content and physical attributes, or artifactual value, of collected materials.  Preservation policies are primarily concerned with the maintenance of these two things, either through reformatting to preserve textual information, or repairs and environmental controls to ensure continued existence of their physical structure (Foot, 19). However, it is necessary to look beyond the physical and informational aspects of objects in order to ensure we are also preserving the integrity of the spiritual or cultural values which may be fundamental in defining the object.   
 
Concerns arise when actions taken to preserve the physical object may compromise the spiritual or cultural integrity of a given object.  Artifacts, including books, throughout history and the present were created and utilized according to rules and taboos that may not be inherently understood in today's world of mass consumer goods and material culture.  While not all books, documents, and artifacts have rituals or socially constructed beliefs associated with their continued existence, it is a relevant issue for many cultural and religious collections.

== Examples ==

An extreme example of how efforts to physically preserve may compromise the socially constructed meaning of the object is the [[Shinto]] Shrines of Ise Jingu, in [[Japan]] (Maré, 2004).  These shrines are of significant cultural and spiritual value to the Japanese people, but every twenty years since the time of Emperor Temmu in the 7th century C.E. the buildings are completely destroyed and rebuilt.  The rebuilding process is based on descriptions in the Documents on the rituals of the Great Shrine of Ise which dates from 804 C.E. and ensures that the recreations are exact replicas of the shrines taken down.  Physical preservation of these monuments would damage the spiritual and cultural integrity of the process and purpose behind the continuous rebuilding.

Similarly, in the [[Buddhist]] faith, materials are considered to have a life, which must be allowed to progress and end naturally.  Impermanence (anitya) in the Buddhist faith relates to the natural end of all things, [[nirvana]], and acts of physical preservation would be contrary to this belief (Karlström). Buddhist [[Conservation of South Asian household shrines|shrines]] are an example of such items that hold spiritual meaning. 

Physical preservation can also work to maintain spiritual and culture integrity of an object, especially in the case of musical instruments.  At the violin museum in [[Cremona, Italy]], nine instruments crafted by the [[Amatis]], [[Guarneris]], and by Antonio [[Stradivari]] are played ceremoniously six days a week – both to keep them in good physical, playable condition, and to maintain their cultural significance and meaning.  From the island of [[Java]] in [[Indonesia]], the instruments of the [[gamelan]] are treated with respect and reverence, and played on a regular basis to maintain their physical and spiritual life.  They are played only for certain occasions and only by certain individuals trained in the art.  They must also be handled and stored with care to be sure no one should compromise their spiritual integrity by stepping over them.  (Kartomi and Mendonça) Gamelan instruments can be found in museums throughout North America, but to accurately remain gamelan instruments, they must be treated and respected according to both their physical and spiritual properties.

However, examples of the significance of meaning and spiritual integrity exist in North America as well.  ''[[Jish]]'' is a [[Navajo people|Navajo]] medicine bundle used in religious rituals related to curing or prevention, and specific care and established provenance is necessary to preserve the existence of ''jish'' versus a simple bundle of herb and grasses.  [[NAGPRA]], or North American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act has helped to highlight this issue of meaning and spiritual integrity in the United States.  The act not only covers objects and remains recovered from American Indian graves, but the subsequent literary material developed based on the examination and analysis of these objects.  (Grose)

Preservation of meaning is perhaps most relevant and recognized in museum collections, but this does not mean there are not key books and documents that are defined by their social construction as well as their physical existence.  When a book printed on acid paper turns to dust, there is no doubt that it ceases to exist as book.  However, when books are stacked on top of a [[Koran]], or a [[Guru Granth Sahib]] is repaired rather than ceremoniously cremated, the spiritual integrity of these texts is compromised or destroyed, and the physical object is void of spiritual or cultural meaning.  It may at this point actually cease to be what it had been previously identified as, at least in terms of its cultural or spiritual meaning.

Admittedly, more work and research needs to be done in regard to  preservation of meaning in the area of Library Science.  However, it is necessary for libraries and archival institutions to assess their preservation priorities in consideration of social and cultural meaning in tandem with physical attributes and informational context.  Preservation and curatorial policies and activities can take into account how materials are housed, handled, repaired, or analyzed not just in terms of preserving physical qualities, but spiritual and cultural meaning as well.

[[Radium]] and [[radon]] are important contributors to [[environmental radioactivity]]. Radon occurs naturally in the environment as a result of decay of [[radioactive]] elements in the soil and it can accumulate in houses built on areas where such decay occurs. This radon is among major causes of cancer, estimated to contribute to about 2% of all cancer related deaths in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Radon in homes and risk of lung cancer: collaborative analysis of individual data from 13 European case-control studies|last = Darby|date = January 29, 2005|journal = British Medical Journal|volume = 330|issue = 7485|page = 223|doi = 10.1136/bmj.38308.477650.63|pmid = 15613366|pmc=546066|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Radium, like radon, is a radioactive element and it is found in small quantities in nature and may thus be hazardous to life if concentrated. Radium has its origins as a decay product of certain isotopes of uranium and [[thorium]].&lt;ref&gt;Kirby et al. p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;  Radium may also be released to the environment as a result of human activity, for example, in inproperly discarded products painted with radioluminescent paint.

== Radium ==

===In the oil and gas industries ===

Residues from the [[Petroleum|oil]] and [[natural gas|gas]] industry often contain [[radium]] and its daughters. The sulfate scale from an oil well can be very radium rich. It is the case that the water inside an oil field is often very rich in [[strontium]], [[barium]] and [[radium]] while seawater is very rich in [[sulfate]] so if water from an oil well is discharged into the sea or mixed with seawater the radium is likely to be brought out of solution by the barium/strontium sulfate which acts as a [[Catalyst|carrier]] precipitate.&lt;ref name="profile"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Toxicological Profile for Radon|last = Keith|first =S|publisher = Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (US)|date=May 2012|isbn = |location = Atlanta (GA) |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Radioluminescent products, ie glow in the dark ===

Local contamination from radium-based [[Radioluminescence|radioluminescent]] paints having been improperly disposed of is not unknown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=U.S. Radium Corp. |location=New Jersey |id=EPA ID#: NJD980654172 |title=EPA REGION 2, Congressional District(s): 10, Essex, City of Orange |date=February 5, 2010 |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120714234109/http://www.epa.gov/region02/superfund/npl/0200772c.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In radioactive quackery ===

[[Eben Byers]] was a wealthy American socialite whose death in 1932 as a result of using an [[radioactive quackery]] product called [[Radithor]] is a prominent example of a death caused by radium. Radithor contained approximately 1 μCi (40 MBq) of &lt;sup&gt;226&lt;/sup&gt;Ra and 1 μCi of &lt;sup&gt;228&lt;/sup&gt;Ra per bottle. Radithor was taken by mouth and radium, being a [[calcium]] mimic, has a very long [[biological halflife]] in [[bone]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://jnci.oxfordjournals.org/content/82/21/1667.extract#|title = Radiation Therapy Pursuit Leads to Unearthing of "Hot Bones"|last = Vanchieri|first = Cori|date = November 7, 1990|journal = Journal of the National Cancer Institute|doi = 10.1093/jnci/82.21.1667|pmid = |access-date = January 31, 2015|volume=82|issue=21|page=1667}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Radon ==

[[File:Radon decay in a cloud chamber.jpg|thumb|[[Radon]] in air forms a part of the [[background radiation]], which can be observed in a [[cloud chamber]]]]
The majority of the dose is caused by the decay of the [[polonium]] (&lt;sup&gt;218&lt;/sup&gt;Po) and [[lead]] (&lt;sup&gt;214&lt;/sup&gt;Pb) daughters of &lt;sup&gt;222&lt;/sup&gt;Rn.  By controlling exposure to the daughters the radioactive dose to the [[skin]] and [[lung]]s can be reduced by at least 90%. This can be done by wearing a dust mask, and wearing a suit to cover the entire body. Note that exposure to [[smoke]] at the same time as [[radon]] and radon daughters will increase the harmful effect of the radon. In [[uranium mining|uranium miner]]s radon has been found to be more [[carcinogenic]] in [[Tobacco smoking|smokers]] than in non-smokers.&lt;ref name=profile /&gt;
[[Image:Decay chain(4n+2, Uranium series).svg|thumb|alt=Uranium series|The radium or uranium series.]]

=== Occurrence===

Radon concentration in the open air varies between 1 and 100 Bq per cubic metre.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Daily variation of the radon concentration indoors and outdoors and the influence of meteorological parameters.|last = Porstendörfer|first =J.|date = September 1994|journal = Health physics|doi = 10.1097/00004032-199409000-00011|pmid = 8056597|volume=67|issue=3|pages=283–287|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Radon can be found in some [[spring (water)|spring water]]s and [[hot spring]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Evaluation of the exposure levels to radioactivity in the hot-spring environment of the Island of Ischia during a year|last = Bartoli|first = G.|date = 1989|journal = Annali di igiene : medicina preventiva e di comunità|doi = |pmid = 2484503|volume=1|issue=6|pages=1781–1823|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; The towns of [[Misasa, Tottori|Misasa]], [[Japan]], and [[Bad Kreuznach]], [[Germany]] boast radium-rich springs which emit radon, as does [[Radium Springs, New Mexico]].

Radon exhausts naturally from the ground, particularly in certain regions, especially but not only regions with [[granite|granitic]] soils. Not all granitic regions are prone to high emissions of radon, for instance while the rock which [[Aberdeen]] is on is very radium rich the rock lacks the cracks required for the radon to migrate. In other nearby areas of Scotland (to the north of Aberdeen) and in [[Cornwall]]/[[Devon]] the radon is very much able to leave the rock.

Radon is a decay product of [[radium]] which in turn is a decay product of uranium. It is possible to acquire maps of average radon levels in houses to assist in the planning of radon mitigation measures for homes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://eetd.lbl.gov/IEP/high-radon/USgm.htm |title=Predicted median annual-average living-area concentration, by county |publisher=Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory |accessdate=2008-02-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071231195400/http://eetd.lbl.gov/IEP/high-radon/USgm.htm |archivedate=2007-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Note that while high uranium in the [[soil]]/[[Rock (geology)|rock]] under a house does not always lead to a high radon level in air, a positive correlation between the uranium content of the soil and the radon level in air can be seen.

===In air ===

Radon is related to [[indoor air quality]] as it blights many homes. (See "Radon in Houses" below.)

The radon (&lt;sup&gt;222&lt;/sup&gt;Rn) released into the air decays to [[lead|&lt;sup&gt;210&lt;/sup&gt;Pb]] and other radioisotopes and the levels of &lt;sup&gt;210&lt;/sup&gt;Pb can be measured. It is important to note that the rate of deposition of this radioisotope is very dependent on the season. Here is a graph of the deposition rate observed in [[Japan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |url= http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0265931X05002432 |title= Seasonal and spatial variation of atmospheric 210Pb and 7Be deposition: features of the Japan Sea side of Japan |last= Yamamoto |first= Masayoshi |date= September 21, 2005 |journal= Journal of Environmental Radioactivity |doi= 10.1016/j.jenvrad.2005.08.001 |pmid= 16181712 |access-date= January 31, 2015 |issue=1 |pages=110–131 |volume=86 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Lead210inairatjapan.png|upright=2|thumb|Lead-210 deposition rate as a function of time as observed in Japan]]

===In groundwater===

Well water can be very rich in radon; the use of this water inside a house is an additional route allowing radon to enter the house. The radon can enter the air and then be a source of exposure to the humans, or the water can be consumed by humans which is a different exposure route.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url= http://water.epa.gov/lawsregs/rulesregs/sdwa/radon/basicinformation.cfm |title= Basic Information about Radon in Drinking Water |date= June 30, 2014 |accessdate= January 31, 2015 |publisher= United States Environmental Protection Agency |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150214054459/http://water.epa.gov/lawsregs/rulesregs/sdwa/radon/basicinformation.cfm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2015-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Radon in rainwater===
Rainwater can be intensely radioactive due to high levels of radon and its decay progenies &lt;sup&gt;214&lt;/sup&gt;Bi and &lt;sup&gt;214&lt;/sup&gt;Pb; the concentrations of these [[radioisotope]]s can be high enough to seriously disrupt radiation monitoring at nuclear power plants.&lt;ref name=Yamazawa&gt;{{Cite conference

===In the oil and gas industries ===

The water, oil and gas from a well often contains [[radon]]. The radon decays to form solid radioisotopes which form coatings on the inside of pipework. In an oil processing plant the area of the plant where [[propane]] is processed is often one of the more contaminated areas of the plant as radon has a similar boiling point to propane.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Survey &amp; Identification of NORM Contaminated Equipment |url=http://www.enprotec-inc.com/Presentations/NORM.pdf |publisher=Enprotec / Hibbs &amp; Todd |date=October 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In mines ===

Because uranium minerals emit [[radon]] gas, and their harmful and highly radioactive [[decay product|daughter products]], uranium mining is considerably more dangerous than other (already dangerous) [[Underground mining (hard rock)|hard rock mining]], requiring adequate ventilation systems if the mines are not [[open-pit mining|open pit]]. During the 1950s, a significant number of American uranium miners were [[Navajo Nation|Navajo]] Indians, as many uranium deposits were discovered on Navajo [[Indian reservation|reservations]]. A statistically significant subset of these miners later developed [[small-cell lung cancer]], a type of cancer usually not associated with smoking, after exposure to uranium ore and [[radon]]-222, a natural decay product of uranium.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Gottlieb |first=Leon S. |last2=Husen |first2=Luverne A. |title=Lung Cancer Among Navajo Uranium Miners |date=April 1982 |journal=Chest |volume=81 |issue=4 |pages=449–452 |doi=10.1378/chest.81.4.449}}&lt;/ref&gt; The radon, which is produced by the uranium, and not the uranium itself has been shown to be the cancer causing agent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=Harley |first=Naomi |date=1999 |last2=Foulkes |first2=Ernest |last3=Hilborne |first3=Lee H. |last4=Hudson |first4=Arlene |last5=Anthony |first5=C.

Currently the level of radon in the air of mines is normally controlled by [[law]]. In a working mine, the radon level can be controlled by [[Ventilation (architecture)|ventilation]], sealing off old workings and controlling the water in the mine. The level in a mine can go up when a mine is abandoned, it can reach a level which is able to cause the [[skin]] to become [[red]] (a mild [[radiation burn]]). The radon levels in some of the mines can reach 400 to 700 kBq m&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Assessment of health risks to skin and lung of elevated radon levels in abandoned mines.|last = Denman|first = A.R.|date = December 2003|journal = Health Physics|doi = 10.1097/00004032-200312000-00018|pmid = 14626324|last2 = Eatough|first2 = J.P.|first3 = G.|first4 = P.S.|last3 = Gillmore|last4 = Phillips|issue = 6|pages = 733–739|volume=85}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A common unit of exposure of lung tissue to [[alpha emitter]]s is the [[Working level|working level month]] ('''WLM'''), this is where the human [[lung]]s have been exposed for 170 hours (a typical month worth of work for a miner) to air which has 3.7 kBq of &lt;sup&gt;222&lt;/sup&gt;Rn (in equilibrium with its decay products). This is air which has the alpha dose rate of 1 [[working level]] ('''WL'''). It is estimated that the average person (''[[general public]]'') is subject to 0.2 WLM per year, which works out at about 15 to 20 WLM in a lifetime. According to the NRC 1 WLM is a 5 to 10 mSv lung dose (0.5 to 1.0 [[Röntgen equivalent man|rem]]), while the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD) consider that 1 WLM is equal to a lung dose of 5.5 mSv, the [[International Commission on Radiological Protection]] (ICRP) consider 1 WLM to be a 5 mSv lung dose for professional workers (and 4 mSv lung dose for the general public). Lastly the [[United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation]] (UNSCEAR) consider that the exposure of the lungs to 1 Bq of &lt;sup&gt;222&lt;/sup&gt;Rn (in equilibrium with its decay products) for one year will cause a dose of 61 μSv.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Radioactivity, Ionizing Radiation, and Nuclear Energy|last = Hala|first = Jiri|publisher = Konvoj|year = 2003|isbn = 9788073020538|location = |pages = |last2 = Navratil|first2 = James}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In humans a relationship between [[lung cancer]] and radon has been shown to exist (beyond all reasonable doubt) for exposures of 100 WLM and above. By using the data from several studies it has been possible to show that an increased risk can be caused by a dose as low as 15 to 20 WLM. Sadly these studies have been difficult as the random errors in the data are very large. It is likely that the miners are also subject to other effects which can harm their lungs while at work (for example dust and [[Diesel exhaust|diesel]] fumes).

===In houses ===

The fact that radon is present in indoor air has been known at least since 1950s and research on its effects on human health started on early 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://monographs.iarc.fr/ENG/Monographs/vol43/|title = Man-made Mineral Fibres and Radon|date = 1988|journal = IARC Monographs on the Evaluation of Carcinogenic Risks to Humans|doi = |pmid = |access-date = January 31, 2015|issue = 43}}&lt;/ref&gt; The danger of radon exposure in [[dwellings]] received more widespread public awareness after 1984, as a result of a case of [[Health effects of radon#Stanley Watras|Stanley Watras]], an employee at the [[Limerick nuclear power plant]] in [[Pennsylvania]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Indoor radon and lung cancer. Estimating the risks.|last = Samet|first = J. M.|date = January 1992|journal = Western Journal of Medicine|doi = |pmid = 1734594|pmc=1003141|volume=156|issue=1|pages=25–29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mr. Watras set off the [[radiation]] alarms (see [[Geiger counter]]) on his way ''into'' work for two weeks straight while authorities searched for the source of the [[contamination]]. They were shocked to find that the source was astonishingly high levels of radon in his [[basement]] and it was not related to the nuclear plant. The risks associated with living in his house were estimated to be equivalent to [[Tobacco smoking|smoking]] 135 packs of [[cigarette]]s every day.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://oldweb.northampton.ac.uk/aps/env/wastes/radon_hotline/radonstory.htm|title = The Radon Story|date = 2001|accessdate = January 1, 2015|website = |publisher = The Radon Council|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://archive.is/20150201024505/http://oldweb.northampton.ac.uk/aps/env/wastes/radon_hotline/radonstory.htm|archivedate = February 1, 2015|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Depending on how houses are built and ventilated, radon may accumulate in basements and dwellings. The [[European Union]] recommends that [[Radon mitigation|mitigation]] should be taken starting from concentrations of 400&amp;nbsp;[[Becquerel|Bq]]/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; for old houses, and 200&amp;nbsp;Bq/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; for new ones.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.polisproject.org/PDFs/Radon%20report%20DSF.doc|title = Radon The Unfamiliar Killer|last = Boyd|first = David R.|journal = |doi = |pmid = |access-date = February 1, 2015|publisher = David Suzuki Foundation|year = 2006|series = Healthy Environment, Healthy Canadians Series, Report No.1|location = Vancouver}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements]] (NCRP) recommends action for any house with a concentration higher than 8&amp;nbsp;[[Curie|pCi]]/L (300 Bq/m³).

The [[United States]] [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]] recommends action for any house with a concentration higher than 148&amp;nbsp;Bq/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; (given as 4&amp;nbsp;[[Curie|pCi]]/L). Nearly one in 15 homes in the U.S. has a high level of indoor radon according to their statistics. The U.S. Surgeon General and EPA recommend all homes be tested for radon. Since 1985, millions of homes have been tested for radon in the U.S.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

By adding a crawl space under the ground floor, which is subject to forced ventilation the radon level in the house can be lowered.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Design and Testing of Sub-Slab Depressurization for Radon Mitigation in North Florida Houses: Part I - Performance and Durability|last = Roessler|first = C.

The '''Religious Studies Center''' (RSC) is the research and publishing arm of [[BYU Religious Education|Religious Education]] at [[Brigham Young University]] (BYU), sponsoring scholarship on [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|Latter-day Saint]] (LDS) [[Culture of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|culture]], [[History of the Latter Day Saint movement|history]], [[Standard Works|scripture]], and [[Beliefs and practices of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|doctrine]].&lt;ref name=RE2003&gt;{{cite journal | title=Religious Studies Center | journal=Religious Educator | year=2003 | volume=4 | issue=1 | pages=110–111 | url=http://contentdm.lib.byu.edu/u?/RelEducator,437 | accessdate=2009-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The dean of Religious Education serves as the RSC's director, and an associate dean oversees the two branches of the RSC: research and publications.

==History==
The RSC (sometimes called the '''Center for Religious Studies''' in its early years)&lt;ref name=ofcountries&gt;{{cite journal | author=Holland, Jeffrey R. | authorlink=Jeffrey R.

Holland]], dean of Religious Education at BYU.&lt;ref name=treasury&gt;{{cite book | chapter=Preface | title=A Book of Mormon Treasury: Gospel Insights From General Authorities and Religious Educators | year=2003 | publisher=Religious Studies Center | location=Provo, Utah | page=ix–x | url=http://contentdm.lib.byu.edu/u?/rsc,22453 | accessdate=2009-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon the recommendation of [[List of presidents of Brigham Young University}BYU president]] [[Dallin H. Oaks]], the establishment of the RSC was approved by BYU's Board of Trustees in early 1976.&lt;ref name=wilkinson/&gt; Holland became the RSC's first director, with Keith H. Meservy, assistant professor of ancient scripture, as administrator.&lt;ref name=wilkinson/&gt; In 1976, Holland was appointed  [[Church Educational System#Chronology of the Commissioner of Church Education|Commissioner of Church Education]], and [[Ellis T. Rasmussen]] replaced him as dean of Religious Instruction and general director of the RSC.&lt;ref&gt;Rasmussen served as dean from 1976-81.  See: {{cite journal | author=McCarlie, V.

For Rasmussen, see: {{cite journal | author=Anderson, Lavina Fielding | authorlink=Lavina Fielding Anderson | title=A Respectful Meeting of the Minds | journal=[[Ensign (LDS magazine)|Ensign]] | date=June 1978 | page=70| url=http://www.lds.org/ensign/1978/06/a-respectful-meeting-of-the-minds | accessdate=2009-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The RSC brought together several earlier BYU institutions. It became the home of the '''Richard L. Evans Chair of Christian Understanding''',&lt;ref name=wilkinson/&gt; which had been founded in 1973 with [[Truman G. Madsen]] as its first occupant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Chair of Christian Understanding Founded | journal=[[Ensign (LDS magazine)|Ensign]] | date=January 1973 | page=138 | url=http://www.lds.org/ensign/1973/01/news-of-the-church/chair-of-christian-understanding-founded | accessdate=2009-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Madsen became a professor emeritus in 1994, and the position was renamed the '''Richard L. Evans Chair of Religious Understanding''', reflecting the hope that holders would extend the hand of friendship to all people, not just Christians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Grover |first=Steven David |date=2008 |title=Building Bridges: The Richard L. Evans Chair of Religious Understanding |url=https://rsc.byu.edu/archived/volume-9-number-2-2008/building-bridges-richard-l-evans-chair-religious-understanding |journal=Religious Educator |volume=9 |issue=2 |pages=45–56 |publisher=[[Brigham Young University]] |accessdate=November 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The RSC also assumed and expanded upon the activities of the '''Institute of Mormon Studies''', which was founded to study Mormon history and doctrine under [[Daniel H. Ludlow]] in 1961 and Madsen in 1966. Likewise, the RSC absorbed the '''Book of Mormon Institute''', a center for research on the [[Book of Mormon]], with Ludlow as its first director in 1965, followed by [[Paul R. Cheesman]] in 1968.&lt;ref name=wilkinson/&gt;

In September 1985, at the request of Holland, then BYU's president, the RSC began holding annual symposia on the Book of Mormon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Cheesman, Paul R. | authorlink=Paul R. Cheesman | chapter=Preface | title=The Book of Mormon: The Keystone Scripture: Papers from the First Annual Book of Mormon Symposium | page=ix | year=1988 | publisher=Religious Studies Center | url=http://contentdm.lib.byu.edu/u?/rsc,19326 | accessdate=2009-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first of these was organized by  [[Paul R.

Cheesman (1921-1991) Papers, 1945-1991 |publisher=[[Harold B. Lee Library]] |accessdate=November 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each symposium successively covered following sections of the book&lt;ref name=matthews87&gt;{{cite journal | title=A Conversation about the BYU Religious Studies Center | journal=[[Ensign (LDS magazine)|Ensign]] | date=January 1987 | pages=79–80 | url=http://www.lds.org/ensign/1987/01/news-of-the-church/a-conversation-about-the-byu-religious-studies-center | accessdate=2009-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; until 1994, when papers on the entire book had been published in nine anthology volumes in the ''Book of Mormon Symposium Series''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | chapter=Religious Studies Center Publications | editor=[[Monte S. Nyman]] |editor2=Charles D.

The faculty publications directors have consisted of [[S. Kent Brown]] (1985{{snd}}1987), Charles D. Tate Jr. (1987{{snd}}1994), [[Kent P. Jackson]] (1994{{snd}}2001), Richard D. Draper (2001{{snd}}2004), [[Richard N. Holzapfel]] (2004{{snd}}2010), [[Robert L. Millet]] (2010{{snd}}2012), Dana M. Pike (2012{{snd}}2013), Thomas A. Wayment (2013{{snd}}2018), and [https://rsc.byu.edu/faculty-and-staff-profiles Scott C. Esplin] (2018{{snd}}present).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://rsc.byu.edu/faculty-and-staff-profiles |title=Faculty and Staff Profiles |website=Religious Studies Center |accessdate=November 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; All have significantly influenced the nature and quality of the academic books and journal articles published.

In 2001, the dean of Religious Education, Andrew C. Skinner, asked Richard D. Draper to reorganize the center with Holzapfel as editor of the new ''Religious Educator'' journal and [https://rsc.byu.edu/faculty-and-staff-profiles Devan Jensen] as executive editor to professionalize the publications. The RSC created a new advisory board with male and female members from diverse backgrounds with interest in ancient scripture and modern history and doctrine of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church). Draper negotiated a partnership with Covenant Communications to publish RSC materials; that partnership lasted about five years. The ''Religious Educator'' relied on copyediting by Ted D. Stoddard with design work by Stephen Hales Creative, based in Provo, Utah. Holzapfel started a project to digitize past RSC content; initiated translation of selected articles into Spanish, Portuguese, and German; and launched the ''BYU Religious Education Review'' magazine. Under the leadership of directors Millet, Pike, and Wayment, publications continued to win awards (see list below) and reach a wider audience.

==Purpose==
The RSC seeks to improve religion teaching at BYU, to encourage LDS religious studies, and to promote the study of other religions.  Believing that [[General Authority|church leaders]], not scholars, are the ultimate doctrinal authority, the RSC seeks to only add historical, cultural, and linguistic context and to explore new views of the LDS religious tradition.&lt;ref name=RE2003/&gt; The RSC coordinates and publishes this research&lt;ref name=waterman&gt;{{cite journal | author=Waterman, Bryan | title=A Guide to the Mormon Universe: Mormon Organizations &amp; Periodicals | journal=[[Sunstone Magazine|Sunstone]] | date=December 1994 | issue=97 | page=52 | format=[[PDF]] | url=http://www.sunstonemagazine.com/pdf/097-44-65.pdf | accessdate=2009-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the hopes of growing the body of LDS literature and thought.&lt;ref name=RE2003/&gt;

In 1977, as Church Commissioner of Education, Holland told the center that he hoped it would bring dialogue with other cultures and religions, leading to greater understanding, brotherhood, and peace.&lt;ref name=ofcountries/&gt;  Later, as president of BYU in 1986, Holland recalled that the RSC was established to inform those within the university and the general LDS membership.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Holzapfel, Richard N. | authorlink=Richard N. Holzapfel | title=It's a classic! | date=October 21, 2008 | work=RSC Blog | url=http://rsc.byu.edu/blog/?p=4 | accessdate=2009-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, the RSC began posting its complete library in English and selections in Spanish and Portuguese in order to increase its worldwide presence.&lt;ref&gt;http://rsc.byu.edu/{{full citation needed|date=July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activities==
===Areas of study===
The RSC has funded research in several areas, including ancient scripture,&lt;ref name="nibleyRSC"&gt;{{cite book | chapter=Religious Studies Center, Brigham Young University | page=v | title=Nibley on the Timely and the Timeless: Classic Essays of Hugh Nibley | year=1978 | publisher=Religious Studies Center | url=http://contentdm.lib.byu.edu/u?/rsc,16986 | accessdate=2009-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; ancient studies,&lt;ref name="nibleyRSC" /&gt; the [[Bible]],&lt;ref name="seila"&gt;{{cite book | chapter=Religious Studies Center, Brigham Young University | page=v | title=Excavations at Seila, Egypt | editor=[[C.

===Research and funding===
The RSC awards [[Grant (money)|financial grants]] to BYU faculty and other scholars for research into LDS history, doctrine, scripture, and culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Research Grants |work=Religious Studies Center |publisher=[[Brigham Young University]] |url=http://rsc.byu.edu/rsc_grants.php |accessdate=2009-05-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090427210825/http://rsc.byu.edu/rsc_grants.php |archivedate=April 27, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This research has been published by the RSC&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Skousen, Royal | authorlink=Royal Skousen | chapter=The Book of Mormon Critical Text Project | page=65 | editor=[[Susan Easton Black]] |editor2=Charles D.

===Symposia and Conferences===
A primary function of the RSC is the organization of symposia and conferences on religious subjects, from which selected papers are later published.&lt;ref name=waterman/&gt; Anthologies from symposia on broad topics make up several volumes in the RSC Monograph Series.&lt;ref name=supporting&gt;{{cite book |last=Porter |first=Larry C. |year=1985 |title=Supporting Saints: Life Stories of Nineteenth-Century Mormons |url=https://rsc.byu.edu/out-print/supporting-saints-life-stories-nineteenth-century-mormons |pages=xi–xii |publisher=Religious Studies Center |location=Provo, Utah |chapter=Foreword |chapterurl=https://rsc.byu.edu/archived/supporting-saints-life-stories-nineteenth-century-mormons/foreword-and-introduction |isbn=0-8849-4565-0 |accessdate=November 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Moorty |first=S.

The RSC is also involved with the annual [[Sidney B. Sperry Symposium]],&lt;ref name=treasury/&gt; which have been held at BYU since 1973.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | chapter=Sperry, Sidney B. | author=Rasmussen, Ellis T. | title=Encyclopedia of Latter-day Saint History | editor=[[Richard O.

In 2003 the Religious Education Administrative Council approved a proposal by Richard Neitzel Holzapfel and Thomas A. Wayment to host a conference on the Saturday before Easter which would focus on Jesus's last twenty-four hours and Resurrection. The conference was held and rebroadcast on KBYU Television, helping Religious Education expand its audience. The response to this conference, now called the [http://rsc.byu.edu/easterconference BYU Easter Conference], was so positive that the university decided it should be an annual event, cosponsored by Religious Education and the RSC. Early on, nearly one thousand attendees heard Elder D. Todd Christofferson give the keynote address at the second annual conference, "The Atonement and the Resurrection," later published in the ''Religious Educator''. In subsequent years, the event was shifted to Fridays, often targeted to coincide with Good Friday. Over the years keynote addresses were delivered by President [[Cecil O. Samuelson]] in 2006, Elder F. Enzio Busche in 2007, and Sister [[Bonnie D. Parkin]] in 2009. An estimated 2,500 people attended the 2013 Easter Conference that featured Elder [[John M. Madsen]], [[Bradley R. Wilcox|Brad Wilcox]], and [[Brent L. Top]]. Other well-known keynote addresses have been given by [[Elaine S. Dalton]], [[Spencer J. Condie]], [[Sheri L. Dew]], and BYU president, [[Kevin J Worthen]].&lt;ref&gt;https://rsc.byu.edu/easterconference&lt;/ref&gt; The annual event has stayed quite popular among people living along the [[Wasatch Front]]. The proceedings are published every other year by the RSC in cooperation with  [[Deseret Book]].

In 2006 the RSC began sponsoring the [http://rsc.byu.edu/conferences Church History Symposium], copublishing the proceedings with [[Deseret Book]]. Professor [[Alexander L. Baugh]] initiated the event by proposing a conference to acknowledge the two hundredth anniversary of [[Oliver Cowdery]]'s birth. Since that time, this event has become a premier venue for rigorous and faithful scholarship on Church history. The topics have been Oliver Cowdery,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rsc.byu.edu/recent-books-archived/days-never-be-forgotten-oliver-cowdery|title=Days Never to Be Forgotten: Oliver Cowdery|publisher=Rsc.byu.edu|accessdate=17 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Wilford Woodruff]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://rsc.byu.edu/recent/banner-gospel-wilford-woodruff |title=Banner of the Gospel: Wilford Woodruff |website=Religious Studies Center |accessdate=November 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Taylor (Mormon)|John Taylor]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rsc.byu.edu/archived/champion-liberty-john-taylor|title=Champion of Liberty: John Taylor|publisher=Rsc.byu.edu|accessdate=17 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Preserving the History of the Latter-day Saints,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://rsc.byu.edu/recent/preserving-history-latter-day-saints|title=Preserving the History of the Latter-day Saints|publisher=Rsc.byu.edu|accessdate=17 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; "A Firm Foundation: Church Organization and Administration,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://rsc.byu.edu/recent/firm-foundation-administrative-and-organizational-history-church|title=A Firm Foundation|publisher=Rsc.byu.edu|accessdate=17 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Go Ye into All the World: The Growth and Development of Mormon Missionary Work,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://rsc.byu.edu/recent-books/go-ye-all-world|title=Go Ye into All the World|publisher=Rsc.byu.edu|accessdate=17 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Joseph F.

Millet and others created the ''Religious Educator'' journal to focus on "teaching the gospel, publishing studies on scripture, doctrine, and LDS Church history, and sharing the messages of outstanding devotional essays."&lt;ref&gt;''Religious Educator'' 1 (2000): i.&lt;/ref&gt; Millet replaced the temporary editorial board in 2001 with Richard Neitzel Holzapfel, who became the full-time editor in chief. Holzapfel asked Ted D. Stoddard, a professor in the Marriott School of Business, to explore design and content issues and prepare guidelines that would enhance the scholarly basis of this new publication. Holzapfel clarified the purpose of this new venture: "Our hope is to provide readers with carefully prepared, inspirational, and information-packed writings on a wide range of subjects explicitly associated with the Restoration. Teachers, authors, researchers, and students of Latter-day Saint studies at every level will appreciate discussions of relevant ideas and issues from a perspective of faith."&lt;ref&gt;''Religious Educator'' 3, no. 2 (2002): vi&lt;/ref&gt; The main audience consists of Church Educational System teachers, such as volunteers and paid professionals in [[LDS Seminaries]] and [[Institutes of Religion]] and religion professors at church colleges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Religious Educator: Perspectives on the Restored Gospel |journal=Religious Educator |date=Spring 2000 |volume=1 |issue=1 |page=i |url=http://contentdm.lib.byu.edu/cdm/ref/collection/RelEducator/id/376 |accessdate=November 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007 the RSC agreed to oversee and help fund the student journal ''Studia Antiqua''.

[[File:Revetment 2.png|thumb|300px|right|{{center|Asphalt and sandbag revetment with a [[geotextile]] filter}}]]

In [[stream restoration]], [[river engineering]] or [[coastal engineering]], '''revetments''' are sloping structures placed on banks or cliffs in such a way as to absorb the energy of incoming [[water]].  In [[military engineering]] they are structures, again sloped, formed to secure an area from artillery, bombing, or stored explosives.  River or coastal revetments are usually built to preserve the existing uses of the shoreline and to protect the slope, as defense against [[erosion]].

==Freshwater revetments==
[[File:Sturdy revetments - geograph.org.uk - 1119250.jpg|thumb|left|{{center|Wooden revetments}}]]

[[File:Liliw,Lagunajf5551 01.JPG|thumb|right|Revetment along Oples River ([[Liliw, Laguna]])]]

Many revetments are used to line the banks of freshwater [[rivers]], [[lake]]s, and man-made [[reservoirs]], especially to prevent damage during periods of [[floods]] or heavy seasonal rains (see [[riprap]]).  Many materials may be used: wooden piles, loose-piled boulders&lt;ref&gt;Lake Ontario Riparian Alliance.

Concrete revetments are the most common type of infrastructure used to control the [[Mississippi River]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2018/national/mississippi-river-infrastructure/|title=The struggle to control the Mississippi can help us understand the U.S.|website=Washington Post|language=en|access-date=2018-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;  More than {{Convert|1000|miles|km}} of concrete matting has been placed in river bends between [[Cairo, Illinois]] and the [[Gulf of Mexico]] to slow the natural erosion that would otherwise frequently change small parts of the river's course.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Revetments as coastal defence==
Revetments are used as a low-cost solution for coastal erosion defence in areas where crashing waves may otherwise deplete the coastline. Wooden revetments are made of planks laid against wooden frames so that they disrupt the force of the water. Although once popular, the use of wooden revetments has largely been replaced by modern concrete-based defence structures such as [[Tetrapod (structure)|tetrapods]].

==Tetrapods==
[[File:MumbaiCaltroplikeSeashoreDefence.JPG|thumb|right|{{center|Tetrapod revetment along the waterfront at [[Mumbai]]}}]]
{{main|Tetrapod (structure)}}

In coastal engineering, a tetrapod is a four-legged [[concrete]] structure used as armour unit on [[Breakwater (structure)|breakwater]]s. The tetrapod's shape is designed to dissipate the force of incoming waves by allowing water to flow around rather than against it, and to reduce displacement by allowing a random distribution of tetrapods to mutually interlock.

==Fortifications==

According to the U.S. [[National Park Service]], and referring mostly to their employment in the [[American Civil War]], a revetment is defined as a "[[retaining wall]] constructed to support the interior slope of a [[parapet]]. Made of logs, wood planks, fence rails, [[fascine]]s, [[gabion]]s, hurdles, sods, or stones, the revetment provided additional protection from enemy fire, and, most importantly, kept the interior slope nearly vertical. Stone revetments commonly survive. A few log revetments have been preserved due to high resin pine or cypress and porous sandy soils. After an [[Fortification|entrenchment]] was abandoned, many log or rail revetments were scavenged for other uses, causing the interior slope to slump more quickly.  An interior slope will appear more vertical if the parapet eroded with the revetment still in place."&lt;ref name=NPS-MILITARY-EARTHWORK-TERMS&gt;{{cite web

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4136">The '''SECS-II''' ('''S'''EMI '''E'''quipment '''C'''ommunications '''S'''tandard, Part '''2'''), sometimes called '''SEMI E5''', is a communication protocol used in the semiconductor industry between devices involved in manufacturing. Much like the protocols in the [[OSI model]], SECS-II is a layer above [[SECS-I]] and [[HSMS]]. While SECS-I and HSMS define how the communications are transmitted (such as over [[RS-232C]] or Ethernet), SECS-II defines the format and content of messages that can be sent over SECS-I or HSMS.

The protocol is maintained by the [[SEMI]] organization, from which copies of the [http://dom.semi.org/downloads.nsf/standard?openform&amp;did=3D7290CC518B3F25882573E1004D1495&amp;sid=0 SEMI E5] standard may be obtained for a fee.

==Usage==

The SECS-II defines the message structure between equipment and host. Most of the SEMI E5 standard is a large library of possible messages – a few of which have redundant functionality with different message structures. Most equipment support only a restricted subset of these messages. Some equipment define custom SECS-II messages that are not part of the SEMI E5 standard.

===Messages===

Only a subset of the possible messages is actually required by the [[SECS/GEM|GEM]] standard. Some SECS-II message transactions may be initiated by only the host. Other [http://www.cimetrix.com/semi-e5-secs-ii.cfm SECS-II] message transactions may be initiated only by an equipment. A few message transactions may be initiated by either the host or equipment. In order for a SECS-II message to be valid, it must be used by the correct party and have the correct message format (the SECS-II message structure defined by E5). The host and equipment can agree to support custom messages to implement custom features whose format is not defined in SEMI E5, but this is highly discouraged when standard message are sufficient. 

The SECS-II messages are organized into categories called streams that are identified by an integer between 0 and 255. Each stream category contains specific messages, or functions, also identified by an integer between 0 and 255. A primary message is an odd-numbered function. A secondary message is the corresponding even numbered function. A request for information and the corresponding data transmission is an example of such an activity. In most transmissions when either the host or equipment sends a primary message, the response is the corresponding secondary message.

Unless the reply bit is clear, a primary message should always be responded to with the complementary secondary message. For most SECS-II messages, a secondary reply message is required. For example, if the host sends an S1,F1 (stream 1, function 1) message to request 'Are you there?', then equipment will send a reply S1,F2 message to indicate 'I am here'. Each SECS-II message exchange has a unique transaction ID number. The standards allow message interleaving where there is more than one open, concurrent transaction.

The SECS-II standard also defines lists of allowed data types including ASCII, binary, boolean, 4 and 8 byte floating points, signed and unsigned integers of byte length 1, 2, 4, or 8 and a List; a container for other data elements including other lists.

SECS-II messages are sent as structured binary data. It is a very efficient means to package information across a network without wasting bandwidth. When using the SECS-I standard, RS-232 serial communication, the message size is limited to 7995148 bytes (about 8 MB). When using the [[HSMS]] standard, TCP/IP network communication, the maximum message size is limited to 4294967295 bytes (about 4.3 GB). The structure of each standard SECS-II message is defined by the SEMI E5 SECS-II standard. A message can be a simple data element, such as a binary response or an ASCII string. A message can also be a complex list structure with multiple levels of lists in the hierarchy. The SECS-II standard limits a single element within a SECS-II message to 16777215 bytes (about 16.5 MB).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="35513">'''Sexual mimicry''' occurs when one sex mimics the opposite sex in its behavior, appearance, or chemical signalling. It is more commonly seen within invertebrate species, although sexual mimicry is also seen among vertebrates such as spotted hyenas. Sexual mimicry is commonly used as a mating strategy to gain access to a mate, a defense mechanism to avoid more dominant individuals, or a survival strategy. It can also be a physical characteristic that establishes an individual’s place in society. Sexual mimicry is employed differently across species and it is part of their strategy for survival and reproduction. Examples of sexual [[mimicry]] in animals include the [[spotted hyena]], certain types of fish, [[passerine]] birds and some species of insect among others. These are cases of intraspecific sexual mimicry, but interspecific sexual mimicry can also occur in some plant species, especially orchids. In plants employing sexual mimicry, flowers mimic mating signals of their pollinator insects. These insects are attracted and pollinate the flowers through pseudocopulations or other sexual behaviors performed on the flower.

== Social systems ==

Sexual mimicry can influence the species’ social system. The most common example is the spotted hyenas, ''Crocuta crocuta''. Female hyenas resemble male hyenas in their sexual anatomy: the females have peniform clitorises, resembling a penis, and false scrotal sacs. These characteristics, as well as high [[androgen]] levels in their blood, make for aggressive females, which results in their dominance over males; the female with the lowest rank is more dominant than the highest-ranking male. Within the female population in each clan, there are different ranks: the dominant females, who reproduce at an earlier age and get more access to food, and the non-dominant females. Their dominance is hierarchical and is passed from mother to daughter.  By contrast, male spotted hyenas gain their social status with the length of their stay in the clan;&lt;ref name="East and Hofer. 2001"&gt;{{cite journal |name-list-format=vanc |last1=East|first1=M.

Males also foster amicable relationships with the females to stabilize their position in the social hierarchy.&lt;ref name="East et al. 1993"/&gt;
[[File:Hyena greeting ceremony.jpg|thumb|left|Hyena greeting ceremony]]
Because females are the dominant sex among spotted hyenas, they are the most respected. Subordinate female hyenas initiate a ‘greeting’ with dominant female hyenas as a sign of respect and are forced to do so if they refuse. This greeting used by hyenas reflects the asymmetry of their ranking; the animal being greeted (the subordinate individual) extends its hind legs and the individual doing the greeting (the dominant hyena) licks or sniffs the erect peniform clitoris.&lt;ref name="East et al. 1993"&gt;{{cite journal |name-list-format=vanc |last1=East|first1=ML|last2=Burke|first2=T|last3=Wilhelm|first3=K|last4=Creig|first4=C|last5=Hofer|first5=H|title=Sexual conflicts in spotted hyenas: male and female mating tactics and their reproductive outcome with respect to age, social status and tenure|journal=[[Proceedings of the Royal Society B]]|date=2003|volume=270|issue=1521|pages=1247–54|doi=10.1098/rspb.2003.2363|pmid=12816637|pmc=1691369}}&lt;/ref&gt; By lifting its hind legs, the hyena being greeted (the subordinate hyena) exposes its most vulnerable body part to the other individual, an act that reflects inferiority. As well, when its hind legs are lifted, a scent can be identified by the other individual. Subordinate hyenas expose their scent more often than high-ranking hyenas. This greeting, however, is not commonly seen between males and adult females; when it does occur, it is restricted to males of median or higher rank greeting dominant females.&lt;ref name="East et al. 1993" /&gt;

==Mating systems==

In the spotted hyenas, the only way for the males to mate with the females is if they have the female’s full cooperation because of the female’s peniform clitoris. An increase in the male’s status gave them more access to dominant females in the clan. Female dominant hyenas do not mate with multiple males, possibly due to the cost of cleaning their genitalia, which hyenas are seen doing after copulation.&lt;ref name="East and Hofer. 2001" /&gt;  Because they will get access to the most dominant and better fit males, they do not need to copulate with multiple males to produce offspring of higher fitness. Non-dominant females are observed copulating more often with lower-ranking males.&lt;ref name="East et al. 1993" /&gt; It is costly for female hyenas to give birth through their long peniform clitoris. The umbilical cord is 12–18&amp;nbsp;cm long, while the journey from the uterus to the clitoris end is 40&amp;nbsp;cm. The umbilical cord often breaks before the cub emerges, leading to death by anoxia for many young. This journey is not only harmful for the cubs, but also for the mother. The tissue of the clitoris will sometimes rip open when giving birth for the first time which can be fatal to the mother.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |name-list-format=vanc |last1=Frank|first1=Laurence G.|title=Evolution of genital masculinization: why do female hyaenas have such a large 'penis'?|journal=[[Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution]]|date=February 1997|volume=12|issue=2|pages=58–62|doi=10.1016/S0169-5347(96)10063-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Female spotted hyenas are the choosy sex because they invest in parental care as well as being the dominant sex in the clan. However, males are likely to still have a preference for a particular female as it is seen in other animals; high-ranking females begin breeding at a younger age and their offspring are more likely to survive to adulthood than the offspring of low-ranking females. Males associate more closely with females that are fertile, a state most likely noticed through olfactory cues.&lt;ref name="Skyzman. 2001" /&gt; While middle/high-ranking males associate with high-ranking females, low-ranking males associate equally with high and low-ranking females. Associating with low-ranking females may be due to low-ranking males failing to recognize the reproductive success of high-ranking females or using a different type of reproductive strategy. Males tend to spend lot of time with the female they mate with before conception to avoid other males coming in close contact with her.&lt;ref name="Skyzman. 2001"&gt;{{cite journal |name-list-format=vanc |last1=Szykman|first1=Micaela|last2=Engh|first2=Anne L.|last3=Horn|first3=Russell C.

Sexual mimicry is also used as a mate-guarding strategy by some species. Mate-guarding is a process in which a member of a species prevents another member of the same species from mating with their partner. Mate-guarding is seen in ''Cotesia rubecula'', a parasitic wasp from the [[Braconidae]] family whose mating system is [[polygynous]]. Males are attracted to females through pheromones and they induce females to mate through vibrations, to which the female responds by assuming a specific position. When a male who has copulated with a female sees another male trying to court her, he will often adopt the female receptive position. Post-copulatory female mimicry by the male offers an advantage by acting as a mate-guarding mechanism. If a second male arrives soon enough after the female copulates with the first male, the second male may be able to induce a second copulation which will compete with the first one. However, if the first male who copulated with her mimics the female, it distracts the second male long enough that the female becomes unreceptive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |name-list-format=vanc |last1=Field|first1=Scott A.|last2=Keller|first2=Michael A.|title=Alternative mating tactics and female mimicry as post-copulatory mate-guarding behaviour in the parasitic wasp Cotesia rubecula|journal=[[Animal Behaviour (journal)|Animal Behaviour]]|date=December 1993|volume=46|issue=6|pages=1183–1189|doi=10.1006/anbe.1993.1308}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sneaky copulation==

Sneaky copulation is a strategy used by many aquatic organisms who portray sexual mimicry. Several studies have found that small male fish will look and behave like the female of their species in order to gain access to female territory and copulate with them.&lt;ref name="Goncalves. 1996"&gt;{{cite journal |name-list-format=vanc |last1=Gonçalves|first1=Emanuel J.|last2=Almada|first2=Vitor C.|last3=Oliveira|first3=Rui F.|last4=Santos|first4=António J.|title=Female Mimicry as a Mating Tactic in Males of the Blenniid Fish Salaria Pavo|journal=[[Journal of the Marine Biological Association of the United Kingdom]]|date=11 May 2009|volume=76|issue=2|pages=529|doi=10.1017/S0025315400030721}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Norman. 1999"&gt;{{cite journal |name-list-format=vanc |last1=Norman|first1=M.

The male guards a territory, and when the female lays her eggs, the parental male protects that territory until the eggs hatch. A second type of males, the sneaker males, is parasitic and resembles the female bleniid fish in their small size, colour, and movement patterns. This allows them to intrude into the nest guarded by the parental males. Sneaker males approach the nests with the same colour patterns and movements that the females hold. Most cases of sneaker males are seen when there is a female already inside the nest although sometimes the sneaker fish enters the nest alongside a female. This species of fish releases the sperm before the female releases her eggs into the water&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |name-list-format=vanc  |last=Patzner |first=R.

[[File:Sepia apama.jpg|thumb|left|''Sepia apama'']]
In the Sepiina family, ''Sepia apama'', also known as [[cuttlefish]], have some males that are large and able to guard a female’s nest while other males are small and resemble females in order to sneak in copulations. In the giant cuttlefish, the male courts the female and transfers its sperm to a pouch below the female’s beak. During this process, the female displays a body pattern of black splotches on a white background. Once the eggs are laid, the male guards the nest from any possible suitors and opponents. A ‘second female’ is sometimes seen during male-female interaction in close proximity to the couple. This female-looking cuttlefish has the same black blotches as a real female. If the male leaves to fight other males, this individual approaches the female and copulates with her, usually with success. However, in the absence of rivals, these 'mimicking female' males display the phenotype of a mature male.&lt;ref name="Norman. 1999" /&gt;

==Sexual mimicry against aggression==

A similar phenomenon to the sneaker fish males is observed in the [[dark-edged splitfin]], ''Girardinichthys multiradiatus''. The juveniles resemble the pregnant females in the species by having a dark spot near the vent. In this case, however, the mimicking males have the capability to resemble the females or become a morphologically mature male throughout most of their adult life. This dark spot allows the female-looking males to escape aggression from more dominant males, as well as reducing the chance of having a female nearby flee due to persisting courting males. The mature males do not attack the subordinate fish and the subordinate fish decides when to initiate the fights, which gives it an advantage as the mature male is not expecting this. The dark spot also permits access of subordinate males to females, a characteristic that is advantageous because females’ eggs can only be fertilized during a five-day fertilizing window.&lt;ref name="Marcias. 2001"&gt;{{cite journal |name-list-format=vanc |last1=Macías-Garcia|first1=C.|last2=Valero|first2=A.|title=Context-dependent sexual mimicry in the viviparous fish|journal=[[Ethology Ecology &amp; Evolution]]|date=19 May 2010|volume=13|issue=4|pages=331–339|doi=10.1080/08927014.2001.9522764}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sexual mimicry to avoid aggression is also seen in birds. In some bird species, males have a female-like plumage colour during their second year of life (SY males). These SY males are sexually mature and able to breed, but their morphology differs greatly from the older, after second year (ASY) males. Various studies have looked into this delayed plumage maturation (DPM) and found that the DPM in SY males reduces aggression from ASY males.&lt;ref name="Studd. 1985"&gt;{{cite journal |name-list-format=vanc |last1=Studd|first1=Michael V.|last2=Robertson|first2=Raleigh J.|title=Life Span, Competition, and Delayed Plumage Maturation in Male Passerines: The Breeding Threshold Hypothesis|journal=[[The American Naturalist]]|date=1985|volume=126|issue=1|pages=101–115|jstor=2461565}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Slagsvold. 1991"&gt;{{cite journal |name-list-format=vanc |last1=Slagsvold|first1=Tore|last2=Saetre|first2=Glenn-Peter|title=Evolution of Plumage Color in Male Pied Flycatchers (''Ficedula Hyopleuca''): Evidence for Female Mimicry|journal=[[Evolution]]|date=June 1991|volume=45|issue=4|pages=910–917|doi=10.1111/j.1558-5646.1991.tb04359.x|pmid=28564056}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Muheter. 1997"&gt;{{cite journal |name-list-format=vanc |last1=Muehter|first1=Vincent R.|last2=Greene|first2=Erick|last3=Ratcliffe|first3=Laurene|title=Delayed plumage maturation in Lazuli buntings: tests of the female mimicry and status signalling hypotheses|journal=[[Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology]]|date=27 October 1997|volume=41|issue=4|pages=281–290|doi=10.1007/s002650050389}}&lt;/ref&gt; Female mimicry in birds was first found in European-pied flycatcher, ''Ficedula hypoleuca''. When a dull-coloured male is in the area, mature males reduce their aggressiveness and behave as if the intruder is a female. The dull plumage is seen mostly in younger males, likely due to being born later in the previous spring. The resemblance to females benefit these young males when trying to occupy a territory with many males already present because the young males can gain information and access to a territory that would not be accessible to them otherwise.&lt;ref name="Slagsvold. 1991" /&gt;

There is a big cost to not looking like a male when it comes to defending a territory or attracting a mate. Females show aggression against dull-coloured males, making it harder for them to mate.&lt;ref name="Slagsvold. 1991" /&gt; However, DPM has some benefits: as mentioned above, it reduces aggression from older males.&lt;ref name="Slagsvold. 1991" /&gt;  As well, these female-looking birds are able to get access to territories, mates, and food that may be not be available to them otherwise. Another benefit is that DPM provides SY birds with a longer lifespan; because they do not have to compete with other males, their mortality rate is lower.  This advantage, however, only benefits individuals of species that have a longer potential lifespan and, therefore, DPM would not benefit a short-lived species.&lt;ref name="Studd. 1985" /&gt; This is known as the breeding threshold hypothesis, and states that SY males should only delay breeding if there is a large mortality difference between the SY males who attempt to breed and the ones who do not.&lt;ref name="Studd. 1985" /&gt;
[[File:Platysaurus broadleyi01.jpg|thumb|left|''Platysaurus broadleyi'']] Most studies addressed DPM as a type of sexual mimicry,&lt;ref name="Studd. 1985" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Slagsvold. 1991" /&gt; which is done through deception: male ASY birds should not be able to tell females or SY males apart. However, Muheter et al. (1997) found that territorial males perceive the dull-coloured males as males but they show less aggression because their dull-coloured plumage promotes low competitive ability. They referred to this as [[honest signalling]] and not sexual mimicry.&lt;ref name="Muheter. 1997" /&gt;

Another example of sexual mimicry occurs in Broadley's Flat Lizard, [[Broadley's Flat Lizard|''Platysaurus broadleyi'']], where some males mimic females. Flat lizard males tend to be [[territory (animal)|territorial]] and aggressive towards other males. Therefore, it is beneficial for some males to mimic females in order to avoid aggressive encounters and move freely through the male's territory, looking for mates. There are two types of males in this population; she-males, who mimic females, and he-males, who look like males. The she-males can visually fool the he-males into believing that they are female due to their female morphology. However, the she-males cannot fool the he-males through scent, as he-males can detect the difference. Therefore, the most successful she-males are those who avoid close contact with other males, thereby reducing the chances of detection through chemical signals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |name-list-format=vanc |last1=Whiting|first1=M.

==Molecular control over sexual mimicry==
Female hyenas’ sexual mimicry to males is part of their anatomy and it is thought to have evolved through high androgen levels. While female ancestors were smaller than males, selection must have acted upon androgen levels and female body size to increase both, leading to further selection and larger females than males.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |name-list-format=vanc |last1=Hamilton |first1=William J. 3rd |last2=Tilson|first2=Ronald L.|last3=Frank|first3=Lawrence G.|title=Sexual Monomorphism in Spotted Hyenas, Crocuta crocuta|journal=[[Ethology]]|date=26 April 2010|volume=71|issue=1|pages=63–73|doi=10.1111/j.1439-0310.1986.tb00570.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; The high androgen levels are not present in the female ovaries, as it was once thought;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |name-list-format=vanc |last1=Matthews|first1=L.

However, females’ androgen levels in the blood are as high as the ones found in the male, having the effect of morphologically male-looking females.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |name-list-format=vanc |last1=Racey|first1=P.

Ruffs can also show sexual mimicry through a combination of genetics and hormones. In a population of [[ruff]]s, ''Philomachus pugnax'', there are three types of male morphs: independent males and satellite males, both of which are reproductive competitors, and faeder ruffs that resemble females in their plumage. The first two morphs are controlled by a dominant allele at a single autosomal locus, while the third morph is likely to have come from a combination of a third allele and a lack of [[testosterone]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |name-list-format=vanc |last1=Lank|first1=D.

Testosterone, in this case, expresses sex-limited characteristics by acting on the single autosomal gene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |name-list-format=vanc |last1=Lank|first1=D.

[[File:Biology Illustration Animals Insects Drosophila melanogaster.svg|thumb|right|Biology Illustration Animals Insects ''Drosophila melanogaster'']]
A different example is seen in mature female fruit flies, ''[[Drosophila melanogaster]]'', who are very attractive but their level of attractiveness decreases by half or more after three minutes of mating.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |name-list-format=vanc |last1=Tompkins|first1=Laurie|last2=Hall|first2=Jeffrey C.|title=The different effects on courtship of volatile compounds from mated and virgin Drosophila females|journal=[[Journal of Insect Physiology]]|date=January 1981|volume=27|issue=1|pages=17–21|doi=10.1016/0022-1910(81)90026-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Males release a compound, 7-tricosene, into the female during courtship that lowers female attractiveness. However, the researcher found that the females release this compound as well, six hours after mating. This compound lowers the female’s levels of attractiveness both times, when the male is courting her and during mating. This way, the female mimics the male and with this compound, she lowers her levels of attractiveness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |name-list-format=vanc |last1=Scott|first1=D|title=Sexual mimicry regulates the attractiveness of mated Drosophila melanogaster females|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/83/21/8429.full.pdf|journal=[[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America]]|date=November 1986|volume=83|issue=21|pages=8429–33|pmid=3095835|pmc=386942}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Genetic control over sexual mimicry==
[[File:Paracerceis sculpta illustration.png|thumb|left|''Paracerceis sculpta'' (Marine isopod)]]
Some organisms’ sexual mimicry is genetically determined by specific alleles. Unlike sexual mimicry that arises due to molecular compounds or hormones and can sometimes be induced through these molecules, this sexual mimicry arises from the organism’s genetic material. Besides the female hyenas’ sexual anatomy, which is part of their genetics, some other organisms have only some males/females in their population who look like the opposite sex and this is determined by specific alleles.

In the marine isopod population, ''[[Paracerceis sculpta]]'', there are three different male morphologies: the alpha male is the largest morph, it matures last, and it is the one who gets privileged access to the females. The beta male is of intermediate size, and it mimics the female to get access to females. Last, the gamma male is the smallest morph and it invades harems, where females go to mate with alpha males, for mating opportunities. This morphology is associated with a single autosomal gene and three different alleles. Beta is the most dominant allele, followed by gamma, which is followed by alpha.  Selection on these alleles acts according to the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium and mating success is equivalent among all three morphs.&lt;ref name="shuster and wade. 1991"&gt;{{cite journal |name-list-format=vanc |last1=Shuster|first1=Stephen M.|last2=Wade|first2=Michael J.|title=Equal mating success among male reproductive strategies in a marine isopod|journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]|date=18 April 1991|volume=350|issue=6319|pages=608–610|doi=10.1038/350608a0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The alpha males, who are [[homozygous]] for the alpha allele, mate with many females in a harem. The females prefer to aggregate with other females in the harem, which gives the alpha male a bigger selection of mating partners. Shuster (1992) looked at the behaviour and relationship of each morph with respect to the harem and found that beta and gamma males could locate harems that have sexually receptive females. They were also able to differentiate between a harem with a sexually receptive female, i.e. one that is able to mate, and a non-sexually receptive female, i.e. one that has already deposited the embryo into her pouch and can no longer mate. While it is still unclear how the beta males do this or how their mating strategies work, they are not harassed by alpha males due to their mimicry of females: the beta males can attract other females into the harem since females like to go where other females are, and this provides the alpha males with more mates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |name-list-format=vanc |last1=Shuster|first1=Stephen M.|title=The Reproductive Behaviour of α-, β-, and γ-Male Morphs in Paracerceis sculpta, a Marine Isopod Crustacean|journal=[[Behaviour (journal)|Behaviour]]|date=1992|volume=121|issue=3/4|pages=231–258|jstor=4535029|url=http://isopods.nhm.org/pdfs/2491/2491.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another order of organisms whose sexual mimicry is influenced by their DNA is the [[Odonata]], carnivorous insects known as dragonflies and damselflies. In these species, it is the female who sometimes mimics the male. Within a species, groups of females will differ in colour: one group mimics the males’ colour and they are known as androchromes. Other groups will have their own female colouration and they are known as gynochromes. In ''[[Ischnura elegans]]'', androchromes comprise 6-30% of the female population and their colour is usually blue, like the males; in some populations, androchromes are larger in size than gynochromes. This polymorphism is controlled by an autosomal allele and some studies have looked at the reason for the polymorphism’s maintenance.&lt;ref name="Cordero. 1997"&gt;{{cite journal |name-list-format=vanc |last1=Cordero|first1=A.|last2=Carbone|first2=S.

[[File:Aeshna affinis qtl4.jpg|thumb|left|''Aeshna affinis'' Male]]
[[File:AeshnaAffinisFemaleAndrochrome.jpg|thumb|right|''Aeshna affinis'' Female Androchrome]]
The most likely theory for the  maintenance of the polymorphism in Odonata is the density dependence theory &lt;ref&gt;Hinnekint BO. 1987. [https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Benno_Hinnekint/publication/226650623_Population_dynamics_of_Ischnura_E_elegans_Vander_Linden_Insecta_Odonata_with_special_reference_to_morphological_colour_changes_female_polymorphism_multiannual_cycles_and_heir_influence_on_behaviour/links/57cfe75808ae057987adf34e.pdf Population dynamics of Ischnura e. Elegans (Vnader Linden)(Insecta:Odonata) with special reference to morphological colour changes, female polymorphism, multiannual cycles and their influence on behaviour]. Hydobiologia. 146: 3-31.&lt;/ref&gt; that states that at a high male density, the androchromes are not bothered by the males and their existence is not threatened by male harassment. This hypothesis also assumes that males cannot distinguish between androchromes and other males. This advantage, however, is counteracted with the fact that they will not get a lot of mating opportunities (if any) and their reproduction is limited. This theory is the most likely explanation for the maintenance of polymorphism, since studies have shown that there is an advantage for androchromes in high male-density populations.&lt;ref name="cordero. 1996"&gt;{{cite journal |name-list-format=vanc  |last=Cordero |first=A. |last2=Andres |first2=J.

==Self-control over sexual mimicry==
While, as seen before, most organisms which portray sexual mimicry are born with this morphology/behaviour, this is not always the case. The giant cuttlefish, ''Sepia apama'', mentioned above in the section “sneaky copulations”, is born with the capacity to choose whether to change its morphology to look like a female or a mature male. When no competition is seen nearby, the cuttlefish will look like a mature male and mate with the female. However, when a mature male and a female are copulating, the giant cuttlefish will resemble a female and stay at a close distance of the couple, hoping for a chance to mate with the female if the mature male leaves to fight other males.&lt;ref name="Norman. 1999" /&gt; Another example of an organism that has the capability to remain small and look like a female, or become a morphologically mature male, is the dark-edged splitfin, ''Girardinichthys multiradiatus''. The purpose for their female mimicry was seen before, in the “sexual mimicry against aggression” section where the female-looking males will escape aggression from dominant males and avoid females fleeing their company due to persisting courting males.&lt;ref name="Marcias. 2001" /&gt;

==Interspecific deceptive mimicry==
[[File:Bee Orchid - geograph.org.uk - 852335.jpg|thumb|right|Bee Orchid]]

Interspecific sexual mimicry can also occur in some plant species. The most common example of this is known as sexually deceptive pollination and is found among some orchids.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |name-list-format=vanc |last1=Schiestl|first1=Florian P.|title=On the success of a swindle: pollination by deception in orchids|journal=[[Naturwissenschaften]]|date=1 June 2005|volume=92|issue=6|pages=255–264|doi=10.1007/s00114-005-0636-y|url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Florian_Schiestl/publication/7809683_On_the_success_of_a_swindle_pollination_by_deception_in_orchids/links/00b7d523831856b19a000000.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The orchid mimics its pollinator’s females, usually [[hymenoptera]]ns such as wasps and bees, attracting the males to the flower. Orchid flowers mimic the sex pheromones and to some degree the visual appearance of the female insect of its pollinator species. The primacy of olfactory over visual cues has been demonstrated in many cases, such as in the European orchid genus [[Ophrys]] as well as many Australian sexually deceptive orchids. In few other cases, such as the South African daisy ''[[Gorteria diffusa]]'', visual signals seem to be of primary importance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |name-list-format=vanc |last1=Ellis|first1=Allan G.|last2=Johnson|first2=Steven D.|title=Floral Mimicry Enhances Pollen Export: The Evolution of Pollination by Sexual Deceit Outside of the Orchidaceae|journal=[[The American Naturalist]]|date=November 2010|volume=176|issue=5|pages=E143–E151|doi=10.1086/656487}}&lt;/ref&gt; Visual signals also enhance the attractiveness of the flowers of some Ophrys species to their pollinators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |name-list-format=vanc |last1=Gaskett|first1=A.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5201">A '''teloblast''' is a large cell in the embryos of [[clitellate]] [[annelid]]s which asymmetrically divide to form many smaller cells known as [[blast cells]].  These blast cells further proliferate and differentiate to form the [[segmentation (biology)|segmental]] tissues of the annelid.  Teloblasts are well studied in [[leeches]], though they are also present in the other major class of clitellates: the [[oligochaetes]].

[[Image:Wiki3 fig1.jpg|thumb|alt=teloblasts in leech development | Teloblasts divide asymmetrically to form small blast cells which wrap around the embryo and extend rostrally. Here, the embryo is shown at late stage 7 (upper right). The N, O, P, Q, and M teloblasts are always positioned in the same relative orientations (lower left).]]

== Developmental role and morphology ==

All teloblasts are specified from the D quadrant [[macromere]] after the second round of divisions post-fertilization. There are five pairs of teloblasts, one on each side of the embryo. Four of the teloblasts (N, O, P, and Q) give rise to [[ectodermal]] tissue  and one pair (M) gives rise to [[mesodermal]] tissue. The column of blast cells arising out of each teloblast is known as a bandlet.  All five bandlets coalesce into one [[germinal band]] on each side of the embryo, extending out from the teloblast towards the head (in the [[Anatomical terms of location#Directional terms|rostral]] direction). The teloblasts are located at the rear of the embryo.

Teloblasts have two separate [[cytoplasmic]] domains: the teloplasm and the vitelloplasm. The teloplasm contains the [[Cell nucleus|nucleus]], [[ribosomes]], [[mitochondria]], and other subcellular [[organelles]]. The vitelloplasm contains mostly [[yolk]] [[platelets]]. Only the teloplasm gets passed onto the daughter stem cells after [[cell division]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/0012-1606(80)90344-9 | author = Fernández, J., &amp; Stent, G. S. | title = Embryonic development of the glossiphoniid leech Theromyzon rude: structure and development of the germinal bands | journal = Developmental Biology | volume = 78 | issue = 2 | pages = 407–34 | year = 1980 | pmid = 7409309}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== O/P specification ==

The O and P teloblasts are specified from two separate but identical precursors, which form an equivalence group These two precursor cells are termed O/P cells for their ability to become either O or P teloblasts. Signals from the surrounding cells act to specify which fate the teloblasts and their progeny take on. Interactions with the q bandlet, however transient, can induce the p fate in the adjacent o/p bandlet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Kuo, D., &amp; Shankland, M. | title =Evolutionary diversification of specification mechanisms within the O/P equivalence group of the leech genus Helobdella | journal = Development | volume = 131 | issue = 23 | pages = 5859–69 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15525668 | doi = 10.1242/dev.01452}}&lt;/ref&gt; The M bandlet has been shown to In some species (i.e. Helobdella triserialis), the provisional epithelium covering the cells plays a role in inducing the O fate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/0012-1606(87)90255-7 | author = Ho, R. K., &amp; Weisblat, D. A. | title =A provisional epithelium in the leech embryo: Cellular origins and influence on a developmental equivalence group. | journal = Developmental Biology | volume = 120 | issue = 2 | pages = 520–534 | year = 1987 | pmid = 3549391}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the absence of cell-cell interactions, the O/P precursors will become O teloblasts. O and P bandlets exhibit very different mitotic patterns (see figure) which are used to identify them in experimental manipulations.

[[Image:OPteloblast.jpg|thumb|alt=O/P teloblast specification| O and P teloblasts have very different cell division patterns. The patterns of stereotyped mitoses for other teloblasts can be found here:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Bissen, S. T., &amp; Weisblat, D. A. | title = The durations and compositions of the cell cycles in embryos of the leech, Helobdella triserialis | journal = Development | volume = 105 | pages = 105–118 | year = 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

== Segmental fates ==

The N and Q teloblasts contribute two blast cells per segment, one making up the anterior half of the segment, the second making up the posterior half of the segment.  The O, P, and M lineages contribute one blast cell per segment, but the contributions from each blast cell spans a segmental boundary.  These segmental boundaries were discovered by injecting teloblasts with cell lineage tracers after a few blast cells have already been generated.  During development, the N and Q bandlets, which eventually have 64 blast cells each, slide past the O,P,and M bandlet, which only have 32 cells.  Thus, the segmental boundaries within each bandlet are already specified before all the bandlets come into complete register.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Weisblat DA, Shankland M | title = Cell lineage and segmentation in the leech | journal = Philos Trans R Soc Lond B Biol Sci | volume = 312 | issue = 1153 | pages = 39–56 | year = 1985 | pmid = 2869529 | doi = 10.1098/rstb.1985.0176}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1956">'''Tonkunst''', literally "The Art of Tone", is an obsolete term in the German language applied for art music of the 19th century, and often used in music history and [[Aesthetics of music|musical aesthetic]] representations.&lt;ref&gt;Weber, William, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=TRQMMHIW6NkC&amp;pg=PA87&amp;dq=tonkunst+term&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=a7nQT52sEIrRhAfxgunwCw&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=tonkunst%20term&amp;f=false The Musician As Entrepreneur, 1700-1914: Managers, Charlatans, and Idealists],'' p. 87, [[Indiana University Press]] (2004), {{ISBN|0253344565}}&lt;/ref&gt; It probably originated from the need to give the music a place among the classical arts like [[architecture]], [[sculpture]], [[painting]], [[prose]] and [[poetry]], and also recognize the composer or musician as a creative individual.

A '''tragic hero''' is the [[protagonist]] of a [[tragedy]] in [[dramas]].  In his ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'', [[Aristotle]] records the descriptions of the tragic hero to the playwright and strictly defines the place that the tragic hero must play and the kind of man he must be. Aristotle based his observations on previous dramas.&lt;ref&gt; Aristotle, On Poetics, Ingram Bywater&lt;/ref&gt;  Many of the most famous instances of tragic heroes appear in [[Greek literature]], most notably the works of [[Sophocles]] and [[Euripides]]. Others, like the contemporary tragedy of J.P. Carney, happen in the ordinary confinements of our own world, bespeaking to the hubris of the modern man in the age of technology and leg day.

==Aristotle's tragic hero==

In ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'', Aristotle suggests that the hero of a tragedy must evoke a sense of pity or fear within the audience, stating that “the change of fortune presented must not be the spectacle of a virtuous man brought from prosperity to adversity."&lt;ref&gt;S.H. Butcher, The Poetic of Aristotle (1902), pp. 45-47&lt;/ref&gt; In essence, the focus of the hero should not be the loss of his [[prosperity]]. He establishes the concept that [[pity]] is an emotion that must be elicited when, through his actions, the character receives undeserved misfortune, while the emotion of [[fear]] must be felt by the audience when they contemplate that such misfortune could possibly befall themselves in similar situations. Aristotle explains such change of fortune "should be not from bad to good, but, reversely, from good to bad.” Such misfortune is visited upon the tragic hero "not through vice or depravity but by some error of judgment." This error, or [[hamartia]], refers to a flaw in the character of the hero, or a mistake made by the character.

An example of a mistake made by a tragic hero can be found in Sophocles' ''[[Oedipus Rex]]''. In the story, the character of Oedipus is given a prophecy that he will murder his own father and marry his own mother. Although he goes to great lengths to avoid fulfilling the prophecy, Oedipus learns that the life of a man he took, Laius, was actually that of his own father, and that the woman to which he is married, Jocasta, is actually his own mother.

[[Creon]] of Sophocles' ''[[Antigone (Sophocles)|Antigone]]'' is another notable example of a tragic hero. Polyneices and his brother, Eteocles, were kings, and the former wanted more power, so he left and assembled an army from a neighboring city. They attacked and the two brothers killed each other. Through Creon's law forbidding the burial of [[Polyneices]], Creon dooms his own family. Other examples provided by Aristotle include [[Thyestes]].

Therefore, the Aristotelian hero is characterized as virtuous but not "eminently good," which suggests a noble or important personage who is upstanding and morally inclined while nonetheless subject to [[human error]]. Aristotle's tragic heroes are flawed individuals who commit, without evil intent, great wrongs or injuries that ultimately lead to their misfortune, often followed by tragic realization of the true nature of events that led to this destiny.&lt;ref&gt;Charles H. Reeves, The Aristotelian Concept of The Tragic Hero, Vol. 73, No. 2 (1952), Published by: The Johns Hopkins University Press Stable URL: https://www.jstor.org/stable/291812 pp. 172-188&lt;/ref&gt; This means the hero still must be – to some degree – morally grounded. The usual [[irony]] in Greek tragedy is that the hero is both extraordinarily capable and highly moral (in the Greek [[honor]]-culture sense of being duty-bound to moral expectations), and it is these exact, highly-admirable qualities that lead the hero into tragic circumstances.  The tragic hero is snared by his or her own greatness: extraordinary competence, a righteous passion for duty, and (often) the arrogance associated with greatness ([[hubris]]).

==In other media==
The influence of the Aristotelian hero extends past [[Classical Greece|classical Greek]] [[literary criticism]]. Greek theater had a direct and profound influence on Roman theater and formed the basis of Western theater that continues into the modern era, deeply influencing a wide variety of arts throughout the world, in diverse mediums such as literature, music, film, television and even video games. Many iconic characters featured in these genres follow the archetype of the tragic hero. Examples of such characters include [[Anakin Skywalker]] from George Lucas'  ''[[Star_Wars#Prequel_trilogy|Star Wars]]'' films, Okonkwo from Nigerian author Chinua Achebe's novel ''[[Things Fall Apart]]'', Arthas Menethil from the video game franchise ''[[Warcraft]]'', and [[Stannis Baratheon]] from [[George R. R. Martin]]'s novel series ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' and the HBO television series adaptation ''[[Game of Thrones]]''. Some film historians regard [[Michael Corleone]] of ''[[The Godfather (film series)|The Godfather]]'' a tragic hero, although using traditional literary conventions, the character would more closely fit the role of [[villain]], not tragic hero.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.afi.com/tvevents/100years/handv.aspx AFI's 100 Years... 100 Heroes and Villains] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071023071414/http://www.afi.com/tvevents/100years/handv.aspx |date=October 23, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
