'''20-Hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid''', also known as 20-HETE or 20-hydroxy-5''Z'',8''Z'',11''Z'',14''Z''-eicosatetraenoic acid, is an [[eicosanoid]] metabolite of [[arachidonic acid]] that has a wide range of effects on the [[vascular system]] including the regulation of vascular tone, blood flow to specific organs, sodium and fluid transport in the kidney, and vascular pathway remodeling.  These vascular and kidney effects of 20-HETE have been shown to be responsible for regulating blood pressure and blood flow to specific organs in rodents; genetic and preclinical studies suggest that 20-HETE may similarly regulate blood pressure and contribute to the development of stroke and heart attacks.  Additionally the loss of its production appears to be one cause of the human neurological disease, [[Hereditary spastic paraplegia]].  Preclinical studies also suggest that the overproduction of 20-HETE may contribute to the progression of certain human cancers, particularly those of the breast.

== Biosynthesis ==

=== Production in humans ===
A subset of [[Cytochrome P450]] (CYP450) [[microsome]]-bound ω-hydroxylases, the [[Cytochrome P450 omega hydroxylase]]s, metabolize [[arachidonic acid]] to 20-HETE by an [[omega oxidation]] reaction.&lt;ref name="Kroetz_2005"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kroetz DL, Xu F | title = Regulation and inhibition of arachidonic acid omega-hydroxylases and 20-HETE formation | journal = Annual Review of Pharmacology and Toxicology | volume = 45 | issue =  | pages = 413–38 | year = 2005 | pmid = 15822183 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.pharmtox.45.120403.100045 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  CYP450 enzymes belong to a superfamily which in humans is composed of at least 57 members and in mice at least 120 members.&lt;ref name="Panigrahy_2010"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Panigrahy D, Kaipainen A, Greene ER, Huang S | title = Cytochrome P450-derived eicosanoids: the neglected pathway in cancer | journal = Cancer Metastasis Reviews | volume = 29 | issue = 4 | pages = 723–35 | date = Dec 2010 | pmid = 20941528 | pmc = 2962793 | doi = 10.1007/s10555-010-9264-x }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Among this superfamily, certain members of the CYP4A and CYP4F subfamilies in the CYP4 family are considered predominant cytochrome P450 enzymes that are responsible in most tissues for forming 20-HETE and, concurrently, smaller amounts of 19-hydroxy-5''Z'',8''Z'',11''Z'',14''Z''-eicosatetraenoic acid (19-HETE).&lt;ref name="Kroetz_2005" /&gt;  However, [[CYP2U1]] may also contribute to the production of these two HETEs&lt;ref name="pmid14660610"&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=14660610|year=2004|author1=Chuang|first1=S.

The production of 19-HETE with 20-HETE may be significant since 19(''R'')-HETE, although not its [[stereoisomer]], 19(''S'')-HETE, inhibits the action of 20-HETE on vascular endothelial cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=18156192|year=2008|author1=Cheng|first1=J|title=20-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid causes endothelial dysfunction via eNOS uncoupling|journal=AJP: Heart and Circulatory Physiology|volume=294|issue=2|pages=H1018–26|last2=Ou|first2=J.

In humans, the CYP4 ω-hydroxylases include [[CYP4A11]], [[CYP4F2]], and [[CYP4F3]] with the predominant 20-HETE-synthesizing enzymes being CYP4F2, which is the major 20-HETE producing enzyme in the human kidney, followed by CYP4A11.&lt;ref name="Hoopes_2015"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hoopes SL, Garcia V, Edin ML, Schwartzman ML, Zeldin DC | title = Vascular actions of 20-HETE | journal = Prostaglandins &amp; Other Lipid Mediators | volume = 120 | issue =  | pages = 9–16 | date = Jul 2015 | pmid = 25813407 | pmc = 4575602 | doi = 10.1016/j.prostaglandins.2015.03.002 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=23688133|pmc=4245146|year=2013|author1=Edson|first1=K.

=== Production by rodents and other animals ===
In mice, the only 20-HETE- and 19-HETE-producing enzymes of the Cyp4a subfamily are two extensively homologous ones, Cyp4a12a and Cyp4a12b; Cyp4a12a is expressed in the male kidney in an androgen hormone-dependent manner.&lt;ref name="pmid25986599"&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=25986599|pmc=4575609|year=2015|author1=Capdevila|first1=J.

Mouse CYP2J9, rat CYP2J3, and sheep CYP2J metabolize arachidonic acid primarily to 19-HETE but also to smaller amounts of 20-HETE, and, in the case of the sheep enzyme, 18-HETE; human [[CYP2J2]], however, is an [[epoxygenase]], metabolizing arachidonic acid to [[epoxide]] products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=20021200|pmc=3067055|year=2010|author1=Messina|first1=A|title=Molecular cloning and enzymatic characterization of sheep CYP2J|journal=Xenobiotica|volume=40|issue=2|pages=109–18|last2=Nencioni|first2=S|last3=Gervasi|first3=P.

=== Factors regulating 20-HETE production ===
Many agents stimulate cells and tissues to produce 20-HETE in vitro and in vivo.  [[Androgens]] are particularly potent stimulators of this production.&lt;ref name="Prostaglandins Other Lipid Mediat 2011"&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=21722750 |pmc=3248593 |year=2011 |author1=Wu |first1=C.

J. |doi=10.1540/jsmr.41.175}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nitric oxide]], [[carbon monoxide]], and [[superoxide]] inhibit 20-HETE production; these non-pharmacological agents do so by binding to the [[Heme]] binding site of the 20-HETE producing cytochrome p450 enzymes.&lt;ref name="pmid25427230"&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=25427230|pmc=4260681|year=2015|author1=Fan|first1=F|title=Cytochrome P450 eicosanoids in hypertension and renal disease|journal=Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension|volume=24|issue=1|pages=37–46|last2=Muroya|first2=Y|last3=Roman|first3=R.

There are several other pathways that metabolize 20-HETE.  Human [[platelets]] and other tissues metabolize it via [[cyclooxygenase]](s) to form the 20-hydroxy analogs of [[prostaglandin G2]], [[thromboxane A2]], [[thromboxane B2]] and to 11(''R'')-hydroperoxy,20-hydroxy-5''Z'',8''Z'',11''Z'',14''Z''-eicosatetraenoic acid which is rapidly reduced to 11,20-dihydroxy-5''Z'',8''Z'',11''Z'',14''Z''-eicosatetraenoic acid; they also metabolize it through [[12-lipoxygenase]] to form 12(''S'')-hydroperoxy,20-hydroxy-5''Z'',8''Z'',101''E'',14''Z''-eicosatetraenoic acid which is also rapidly reduced to 12,20-dihydroxy-5''Z'',8''Z'',101''E'',14''Z''-eicosatetraenoic acid.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=1327375|pmc=1907511|year=1992|author1=Hill|first1=E|title=Biological activity and metabolism of 20-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid in the human platelet|journal=British Journal of Pharmacology|volume=106|issue=2|pages=267–74|last2=Fitzpatrick|first2=F|last3=Murphy|first3=R.

== Tissue distribution of 20-HETE-producing enzymes and/or activity ==

20-HETE-synthesizng enzymes are widely distributed to liver, kidney, brain, lung, intestine and blood vessels.&lt;ref name="Kroetz_2005" /&gt; In most vascular systems, 20-HETE synthesizing activity is limited to vascular smooth muscle of small blood vessels with little or no such activity in the vessel's endothelial cells or in large blood vessels.&lt;ref name="Hoopes_2015" /&gt;  However, both the smooth muscle and endothelial cells obtained from mouse brain microvasculature, produce 20-HETE in culture.&lt;ref name="J Biol Chem p 30" /&gt;

=== Rodent Studies ===

==== Blood vessel contraction ====
In various rodent models, 20-HETE, at low concentrations (&lt;50 nanomolar), acts to constrict arteries by sensitizing (i.e. increasing) the contraction responses of these artery's [[smooth muscle cells]] to other contracting agents such as alpha adrenergic agonists,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=15130884 |year=2004 |author1=Zhang |first1=F |title=Transfection of CYP4A1 cDNA decreases diameter and increases responsiveness of gracilis muscle arterioles to constrictor stimuli |journal=AJP: Heart and Circulatory Physiology |volume=287 |issue=3 |pages=H1089–95 |last2=Wang |first2=M.

Other agents such as [[Androgens]] &lt;ref name="Prostaglandins Other Lipid Mediat 2011" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Prostaglandins Other Lipid Mediat 2014" /&gt; and [[alpha adrenergic]] compounds such as [[norepinephrine]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceB" /&gt; likewise stimulate 20-HETE production and have vasoconstrictive actions which are enhanced by 20-HETE.  These circular or [[positive feedback]] interactions may serve to perpetuate vasoconstrictor responses.&lt;ref name="Hoopes_2015"/&gt;

Again in rodent models, 20-HETE acts to block [[Calcium-activated potassium channel]]s to promote the entry of ionic calcium into vascular smooth muscle cells through the [[L-type calcium channel]]; the attendant rise in intracellular calcium triggers these muscles to contract.&lt;ref name="Top Med Chem. 2013;1312:1429-40"&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=23688133 |pmc=4245146 |year=2013 |author1=Edson |first1=K.

E. |doi=10.2174/15680266113139990110}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies in rats also indicate that in vascular endothelial cells 20-HETE inhibits the association of the [[nitric oxide]]-producing enzyme, endothelial [[nitric oxide synthase]] (eNOS) with [[heat shock protein 90]]; this inhibits the ability of eNOS to become activated. The endothelial cells become dysfunctional in exhibiting decreased ability to produce the vasodilating agent, nitric oxide, and in containing elevated levels of a potentially injurious oxygen radical, [[superoxide anion]]; the blood vessels to which these dysfunctional endothelial cells belong are less able to dilate in response to the vasodilator, acetylcholine.&lt;ref name="Hoopes_2015"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=18156192 |year=2008 |author1=Cheng |first1=J |title=20-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid causes endothelial dysfunction via eNOS uncoupling |journal=AJP: Heart and Circulatory Physiology |volume=294 |issue=2 |pages=H1018–26 |last2=Ou |first2=J.

20-HETE can also constrict rodent (and human) artery preparations by directly activating the [[thromboxane receptor|receptor]] for [[thromboxane A2]]. While significantly less potent than thromboxane A2 in activating this receptor, studies on rat and human cerebral artery preparations indicate that increased blood flow through these arteries triggers production of 20-HETE which in turn binds to thromboxane receptors to constrict these vessels and thereby reduce their blood blow. Acting in the latter capacity, 20-HETE, it is proposed, functions as a mediator regulating blood flow to the brain.&lt;ref name="pmid21610722"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Toth P, Rozsa B, Springo Z, Doczi T, Koller A | title = Isolated human and rat cerebral arteries constrict to increases in flow: role of 20-HETE and TP receptors | journal = Journal of Cerebral Blood Flow and Metabolism : Official Journal of the International Society of Cerebral Blood Flow and Metabolism | volume = 31 | issue = 10 | pages = 2096–105 | year = 2011 | pmid = 21610722 | pmc = 3208155 | doi = 10.1038/jcbfm.2011.74 | url = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid24298905"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Capra V, Bäck M, Angiolillo DJ, Cattaneo M, Sakariassen KS | title = Impact of vascular thromboxane prostanoid receptor activation on hemostasis, thrombosis, oxidative stress, and inflammation | journal = Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis | volume = 12 | issue = 2 | pages = 126–37 | year = 2014 | pmid = 24298905 | doi = 10.1111/jth.12472 | url = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

These vasoconstrictor effects of 20-HETE can reduce blood flow to specific parts of the body, not only to brain (see previous paragraph) but also to kidney, liver, heart and other organs, as well as to portions of these organs; they can also contribute to systemic [[hypertension]] as well as to the physiological and pathological effects of [[Thromboxane receptor#Functions|thromboxane receptor]]-activation  .&lt;ref name="ReferenceB" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Top Med Chem. 2013;1312:1429-40" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid21610722"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid24298905"/&gt;

==== Blood vessel injury ====
[[Sprague Dawley]] rats that underwent balloon injury of the common carotid artery exhibited elevated levels of CYP4A enzyme immunostaining in the smooth muscle of the injured arteries as well as elevated levels of 20-HETE in the injured arteries.  Inhibition of 20-HETE production by two different agents greatly reduced the vascular [[intima]] hyperplasia and vascular remodeling that occurred after balloon injury. The studies suggest that the increase in expression of CYP4A and production of 20-HETE contribute to vascular intima growth, remolding, and thereby healing of injured rat carotid arteries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=23658377 |pmc=3684845 |year=2013 |author1=Orozco |first1=L.

==== Blood vessel thrombosis ====

In the [[C57BL/6]] mouse laboratory model, 20-HETE pretreatment accelerates the development of [[thrombosis]] and reduces blood flow caused by the [[Thrombosis]]-inducing agent, ferric chloride, in the common carotid and femoral arteries; companion studies on [[human umbilical vein endothelial cell]]s indicate that 20-HETE stimulates the activation of [[Extracellular signal-regulated kinases]] to cause ERK-dependent and [[L-type calcium channel]]-dependent release of [[von Willebrand factor]] which in turn stimulates the adhesion of platelets to the endothelial cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=25820395 |year=2015 |author1=Wang |first1=J |title=20-Hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid involved in endothelial activation and thrombosis |journal=American Journal of Physiology.

==== Renal absorption ====
In animal models, 20-HETE stimulates the activation of [[protein kinase C]] in the epithelial cells of the proximal tubules of the kidney; the kinase then phosphorylates and thereby inhibits the [[Na+/K+-ATPase]] and concurrently also blocks the [[Na-K-Cl cotransporter]] and 70 pS K+ channel in the thick [[Ascending limb of loop of Henle]] (TALH); these effects reduce the absorption of sodium and fluids in the [[nephron]] and thereby tend to reduce blood pressure.&lt;ref name="Top Med Chem. 2013;1312:1429-40"/&gt;

==== Hypertension ====
As indicated above, 20-HETE may raise blood pressure by constricting arterial blood vessels but also may lower blood pressure by promoting the loss of sodium and fluids in the kidneys. The effects of 20-HETE therefore are complex, as indicated in studies of the following animal models.  Many of these models appear relevant to hypertension in humans in that they parallel the human disease, i.e. men have higher rates of hypertension than women, and women with increased levels of androgens (e.g. postmenopausal women and women with polycystic ovarian disease) and higher rates of hypertension.&lt;ref name="Prostaglandins Other Lipid Mediat 2011" /&gt;

===== Salt-sensitive hypertension models =====
Dahl salt-sensitive rats develop hypertension that develops more quickly and exacerbated by high intake of salt ([[sodium chloride]]) and ameliorated by low salt intake.  In this model, rats exhibit an up-regulated CYP4A/20-HETE pathway within their cerebral vasculature and vascular endothelial cell overproduction of [[reactive oxygen species]] that in turn stimulates the CYp4A/20-HETE pathway.  Non-selective and non-selective inhibitors of CYP4A and 20-HETE production reduce hypertension in this model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=23438293 |pmc=4106241 |year=2013 |author1=Lukaszewicz |first1=K.

Lewis rats (see [[Laboratory rat]] models) that had one kidney removed and then fed a high salt diet are hypertensive. Kidney medullary interstitial infusion of an inhibitor of 20-HETE production reduced the formation of 20-HETE in the outer medulla of the infused kidney, had no effect on the production of 20-HETE in the cortex of the infused kidney, and produced a mean arterial pressure rise from 115 at baseline to 142&amp;nbsp;mm of mercury; this study indicates that the hypertensive versus hypotensive effects of 20-HETE depend not only on the organ of its production but also, with respect to the kidney, the site within the organ where it is produced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=9039121 |year=1997 |author1=Stec |first1=D.

Mice depleted of Cyp4a14 by [[gene knockout]] (Cyp4a14(-/-) mice develop male-specific, androgen-dependent hypertension.  This seemingly paradoxical result is due to the  overexpression of Cyp4a12a; the knockout of Cyp4a14 (Cyp4a14 does not produce 20-HETE) leads to the overexpression of the 20-HETE-producing cytochrome, Cyp4a149(-/-), and consequent overproduction of 20-HETE.  The model involves increased plasma androgens, increased vascular and urinary levels of 20-HETE, relief of hypertension by castration, and hypertension which is driven by excessive fluid reabsorption in the kidney's proximal tubule secondary to the overexpression of [[Sodium–hydrogen antiporter 3]]; these effects are presumed but not yet shown to be due to the overproduction of 20-HETE.&lt;ref name="pmid25986599"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=11320253 |pmc=33189 |year=2001 |author1=Holla |first1=V.

Mice depleted of Cyp4a10 maintain normal blood pressure on a low salt diet but become hypertensive on normal or high salt diets; this paradoxical result appears due to a decrease in kidney levels of Cyp2C44 caused by the loss of Cyp4a10. Cyp2C44 metabolizes arachidonic acid a family of [[vasodilation]]-inducing and anti-hypertensive products, the [[Epoxyeicosatrienoic acid]]s (EETs).  The model involves normal levels of 20-HETE, reduced expression of Cyp2c44, reduced levels of EETs, and deficiencies in kidney tubule absorption of sodium regulated by EETs, and the normalization of hypertensive blood pressure by increasing expression of Cyp2c44 by treating the mice with an inducer of its expression, an activator of [[PPARα]].&lt;ref name="pmid25986599"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=16691295 |pmc=1459070 |year=2006 |author1=Nakagawa |first1=K |title=Salt-sensitive hypertension is associated with dysfunctional Cyp4a10 gene and kidney epithelial sodium channel |journal=Journal of Clinical Investigation |volume=116 |issue=6 |pages=1696–702 |last2=Holla |first2=V.

A mutation (c.947A&gt;T) in CYP2U1 has been associated with a small number of patients with [[Hereditary spastic paraplegia]] in that it segregates with the disease at the homozygous state in two afflicted families.  The mutation affects an amino acid (p.Asp316Val) highly conserved among CYP2U1 [[orthologs]] as well as other cytochrome P450 proteins; the p.Asp314Val mutation is located in the enzyme's functional domain, is predicted to be damaging to the enzyme's activity, and is associated with [[mitochondria]] dysfunction.&lt;ref name="pmid23176821"&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=23176821 |pmc=3516610 |year=2012 |author1=Tesson |first1=C |title=Alteration of fatty-acid-metabolizing enzymes affects mitochondrial form and function in hereditary spastic paraplegia |journal=The American Journal of Human Genetics |volume=91 |issue=6 |pages=1051–64 |last2=Nawara |first2=M |last3=Salih |first3=M.

T47D cells that overexpress CYP4Z1 also overproduce 20-HETE and when ransplanted into athymic [[Balb/c]] mice show a greater increase in tumor weight and vascularity compared to control T47D cells; these increases are prevented by an inhibitor of 20-HETE production.&lt;ref name="pmid22841774"/&gt;  [[Isoliquiritigenin]], a proposed drug for treating cancer, cause cultured [[MDA-MB-231]] and [[MCF-7]] human breast cancer cells to die by triggering [[apoptosis]].

Since these miRNA's reduce the translation of CYP4Z1, the expression of CYP4Z2P can bind these miRNAs to reduce their interference with CYP4Z1 and thereby increase the production of CYP4Z1 protein and perhaps 20-HETE; indeed, force expression of these 3'UTRs promoted in vitro tumor angiogenesis in breast cancer cells partly via miRNA-dependent activation of the [[phosphoinositide 3-kinase]]-[[MAPK/ERK pathway]] and thereby stimulating the production of vascular endothelium growth factor and possibly other endothelium growth factors.&lt;ref name="pmid25701119"/&gt;  Taken together, these pre-clinical studies suggest that 20-HETE made by one or more of the cited cytochrome P450 enzymes may contribute to the progression of breast cancer by promoting its survival, growth, and vascular endothelial growth factor-induced [[neovascularization]].

20-HETE stimulated the proliferation of cultured human brain [[Glioma]] cell line U251 and, when forced to overexpress CYP4Z1 by gene transfection, overproduced 20-HETE and exhibited a dramatically increased rate of growth that was blocked by inhibiting the cells from producing 20-HETE.  A similar set of findings was found with human [[non-small cell lung cancer]] cells.&lt;ref&gt;

Messenger RNAs for CYP4A11, CYP4A22, CYP4F2, and/or CYP4F3 are more highly expressed in ovary, colon, thyroid, lung, ovary, cancers compared to their normal tissue counterparts; in ovarian cancer, this higher expression is associated with an increased level of CYP4F2 protein expression and an increased ability to metabolize arachidonic acid to 20-HETE.&lt;ref name="pmid22798501"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

While these studies suggest that CYP4A11, CYP4A22, CYP4F2, and/or CYP4F3 produce 20-HETE which in turn promotes the growth of the cited cancers in model systems and therefore may do so in the human cancers, this suggestion clearly needs much further study.  For example, an inhibitor of 20-HETE production blocks the growth of human brain [[U251]] glioma cells in culture; since these cells could not be shown to produce 20-HETE, it was proposed that some other metabolite may by the inhibitor's targeted cytochrome enzymes was responsible for maintaining  these cells growth.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal|pmid=16081682 |year=2005 |author1=Guo |first1=M |title=Human U251 glioma cell proliferation is suppressed by HET0016 N-hydroxy-N'-(4-butyl-2-methylphenyl)formamidine, a selective inhibitor of CYP4A |journal=Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics |volume=315 |issue=2 |pages=526–33 |last2=Roman |first2=R.

&lt;/ref&gt; It is also possible that any such inhibitor has off-target effects that are responsible for its actions.

=== Platelet aggregation ===
20-HETE inhibits the aggregation of human platelets by competing with arachidonic acid for the enzymes that produce prostaglandin H2 and thromboxane A2.  These products are formed in response to platelet stimulation and then act through the [[thromboxane receptor]] to mediate and/or promote the ensuing platelet aggregation response to most stimuli.  The platelets metabolize 20-HETE to the 20-hydroxy analogs of prostaglandin H2 and thromboxane A2, products that are essentially inactive in platelets, while consequently form less of the arachidonic acid-derived prostaglandin and thromboxane products. In addition, 20-HETE itself blocks prostaglandin and thromboxane metabolites from interacting with the thromboxane receptor.&lt;ref name="auto2" /&gt;  Both effects, i.e. replacement of prostaglandin and thromboxane production with platelet-inactive products and thromboxane A2 receptor blockade, are responsible for 20-HETE's platelet aggregation-inhibiting action.  However, the platelet anti-aggregating activity of 20-HETE requires micromolar levels and therefore may be more of a pharmacological than physiological activity.

=== Vasculature ===
20-HETE constricts human artery preparations by directly activating the [[thromboxane receptor|receptor]] for [[thromboxane A2]]. While significantly less potent than thromboxane A2 in activating this receptor, studies on human cerebral artery preparations indicate that increased blood flow through these arteries triggers production of 20-HETE which in turn binds to thromboxane receptors to constrict these vessels and thereby reduce their blood blow. Acting in the latter capacity, 20-HETE, it is proposed, functions as a mediator regulating blood flow to the human brain.&lt;ref name="pmid21610722"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid24298905"/&gt;

=== Metabolic syndrome ===
One study found that 30 patients with the [[metabolic syndrome]] exhibited significantly elevated levels of plasma and urinary 20-HETE compared to matched controls; women with the syndrome had particularly higher urinary 20-HETE levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=19013235 |year=2009 |author1=Tsai |first1=I.

The '''European Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators''' ('''ACER''') is an [[Agency of the European Union]] by the [[Third Energy Package]] in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/energy/gas_electricity/third_legislative_package_en.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-01-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100408140256/http://ec.europa.eu/energy/gas_electricity/third_legislative_package_en.htm |archivedate=8 April 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was established in 2010 and has its seat in [[Ljubljana]], Slovenia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/energy/gas_electricity/acer/acer_en.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-05-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100514151957/http://ec.europa.eu/energy/gas_electricity/acer/acer_en.htm |archivedate=14 May 2010 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 6 May, the administrative board designated [[Alberto Pototschnig]] as its first director. By deciding on their director and chairs, ACER took a step forward towards becoming fully operational.

The basis for the establishment of ACER is [[Regulation 713/2009]] of the [[European Parliament]] and the [[Council of the European Union|Council]] of  13 July 2009. The regulation describes the establishment and legal status, tasks, organisation and financial provisions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2009:211:0001:0014:EN:PDF Regulation 713/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 July 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;

ACER is the second intergovernmental organization headquartered in Slovenia. The first was the [[International Center for Promotion of Enterprises]] (ICPE).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.icpe.si/about-icpe.html{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Tasks ==
The agency:
* complements and coordinates the work of national regulatory authorities,
* participates in the creation of European network rules,
* takes, under certain conditions, binding individual decisions on terms and conditions for access and operational security for cross border infrastructure,

Senegal's [[economy]] is mostly driven by agriculture, fisheries, mining, construction and tourism. Most of [[Senegal]] lies within the drought-prone [[Sahel]] region, with irregular rainfall and generally poor soils. With only about 5 percent of the land [[irrigation|irrigated]], Senegal continues to rely on rain-fed agriculture, which occupies about 75 percent of the workforce. Despite a relatively wide variety of agricultural production, the majority of farmers produce for [[subsistence agriculture|subsistence]] needs. Production is subject to drought and threats of [[pest (organism)|pests]] such as [[locusts]], birds, [[Tephritidae|fruit flies]], and [[white flies]]. [[Millet]], [[rice]], [[Maize|corn]], and [[sorghum]] are the primary food crops grown in Senegal.&lt;ref name=fas/&gt;

Senegal is a net food importer, particularly for rice, which represents almost 75 percent of cereal imports. [[Peanuts]], [[sugarcane]], and [[cotton]] are important [[cash crops]], and a wide variety of fruits and vegetables are grown for local and export markets. In 2006 [[gum arabic]] exports soared to $280 million, making it by far the leading agricultural export. [[Green beans]], industrial [[tomato]], [[cherry tomato]], [[melon]], and [[mango]] are Senegal's main vegetable cash crops. The [[Casamance]] region, isolated from the rest of Senegal by [[Gambia]], is an important agriculture producing area, but without the infrastructure or [[Transportation in Senegal|transportation]] links to improve its capacity.&lt;ref name=fas&gt;Ndiaye, Mbalo. [http://www.fas.usda.gov/gainfiles/200701/146279961.pdf "Senegal agricultural situation country report"]. U.S. [[Foreign Agricultural Service]] (January 17, 2007). {{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the lack of modernization of [[artisanal fishing]], the fishing sector remains Senegal's main economic resource and major foreign exchange earner. The livestock and poultry sectors are relatively underdeveloped and have potential for modernization, development and growth. Senegal imports most of its milk and dairy products. The sector is inhibited due to low output and limited investments. The potential production of fauna and forest products is high and diversified and could, if well organized, benefit poor farmers in rural areas. Although the agricultural sector was impacted by a locust invasion in 2004, it has recovered and gross agricultural production is expected to increase by 6 percent in 2006 and 5 percent in 2007.&lt;ref name=fas/&gt;

==Situation and outlook of the agricultural sector==
Most of Senegal lies within the drought-prone [[Sahel]] region, with irregular rainfall and generally poor soils. With only about 5% of the land [[irrigation|irrigated]], Senegal continues to rely on rain-fed agriculture, which occupies about 75% of its workforce. The sector is inhibited due to low output and limited investments. Although this sector was impacted by a [[locust]] invasion in 2004, it has recovered and gross agricultural production was expected to increase by 6.1% in 2006 and 5.1% in 2007. Reforms of the agricultural sector have suppressed direct government support and engaged the [[privatization]] of state holdings. The main agricultural crops are [[peanut]]s and [[cotton]]—both being important sources of foreign exchange income—as well as [[millet]], [[rice]], [[maize|corn]], [[sugarcane]], and livestock.&lt;ref name=fas/&gt;

Peanuts are the engine of the rural economy and their production accounts for around 40 percent of cultivated land, taking up two million [[hectare]]s. The peanut sector provides employment for as many as one million people. The industry has been suffering from the effects of the privatization of the agricultural sector and the elimination of the import ban on [[peanut oil|peanut]] and other [[edible oils]]. The peanut sector is still dominated by [[SONACOS]], which has been renamed SUNEOR starting January 1, 2007, thus marking the end of the privatization process which started in 2004 when the government decided to sell its shares to [[Advens]], a private consortium including a [[Lebanon|Lebanese]]-French businessman, the Belgian peanut machinery manufacturer Desmet, SODEFITEX (the [[cotton ginning]] company), and SONACOS employees.&lt;ref name=fas/&gt;

In recent years, the reported average annual peanut production lies around 828,000 tons (95% for oil)! Cotton accounts for about 3% of total exports and the third source of export earnings for Senegal (some 28 million US dollars over the period 1995-2000). Cotton is grown in nearly every region and covers almost one third of cultivated acreage. The cotton industry is managed through the former [[parastatal]] SODEFITEX, which was privatized in November 2003 with producers holding 30% of the company's shares.&lt;ref name=fas/&gt;

Production of food crops does not meet Senegal's needs. The production of major staple food crops covers barely 30% of consumption needs. Only in years of favorable rainfall does the country approach self-sufficiency in millet and [[sorghum]], the basic staples with rice. The livestock population includes approximately 3.1 million cattle and 8.7 million sheep and goats. Cattle are reared extensively and on a small-scale basis. Poultry production has increased and has great potential for growth. Despite a significant livestock population, Senegal remains a net importer of meat, especially sheep (live) during major holidays and religious events.&lt;ref name=fas/&gt;

==Agricultural commodities==

===Peanuts===
[[File:ArachidesSénégal.jpg|thumb|300px|A Peanut seller in Joal-Fadiouth, Senegal.]]
[[Peanut]] production accounts for around 40 percent of cultivated land, taking up two million [[hectare]]s, and provides employment for as many as one million people. Although the peanut sector's contribution to foreign exchange earnings has dropped below those of [[fishing]] and [[mining]], peanuts continue to play an important role in the overall economy as the main cash crop for many rural Senegalese [[farmer]]s. Peanuts are processed locally, and prices of processed [[peanut oil]] and other peanut products are set a government controlled commission.&lt;ref name=fas/&gt;

Production of unshelled peanuts varies widely because of periodic drought, and production is frequently underreported because of unauthorized sales to processors in neighboring countries. Total production was estimated at 850,000 tons in 2005. Exports of peanut products reached about [[CFA franc|CFA]] 15 billion ($30 million) in 2005. They account for some 60 percent of total agricultural exports, 75 percent of which is made up of peanut oil. SUNEOR's (former SONACOS) exports of peanut oil account for 45 to 50 percent of the world market trade in peanut oil.&lt;ref name=fas/&gt;

SUNEOR produces approximately 150,000 tons of crude peanut oil per year. The European market, which is its main market, can currently absorb only 90,000 tons. The newly privatized company plans to explore and develop new markets to fully utilize its capacity. In this perspective, exports of peanuts oil to the U.S. have resumed in 2006 and were estimated at about $7 million. Other major peanut oil producers include NOVASEN and the Complex of Touba.&lt;ref name=fas/&gt;

All these three companies produce mainly non-refined peanut oil and non-grilled peanuts for export. Peanut meal/cake is predominantly sold in the local market as animal feed. The local industry also refines imported edible oils for domestic consumption. In 2005 Senegal imported approximately 90,000 tons of crude soybean oil, primarily from Brazil.&lt;ref name=fas/&gt;

===Cotton===
[[Cotton]] is the second largest agricultural [[export]], accounting for around 16 percent of total agricultural exports. It is grown in nearly every region and covers almost one third of cultivated acreage. However, production is concentrated in the South-Eastern part of the country (South of the [[Kahone]]&amp;ndash;[[Tambacounda]] belt, as well as in the [[Casamance]] and [[Kédougou]] regions).&lt;ref name=fas/&gt;

SODEFITEX, the main cotton company, forecasts production at 40,000 tons in 2006. Cotton accounts for approximately 3% of total exports and the third source of export earnings for Senegal (some $23 million in 2005). Most cotton lint produced in Senegal is exported, but since the liberalization of the sector in 1984, producers have preferred selling in parallel markets, where they benefited from better prices. SODEFITEX, which manages most of Senegal's cotton production, was [[privatisation|privatized]] in November 2003. Producers acquired 30% of the company's shares (they had no equity interest prior to privatization). Despite stronger incentives (credit to producers and guaranteed producer prices), the company is still striving to fully use its ginning capacity.&lt;ref name=fas/&gt;

The [[government of Senegal]] is committed to participating in the U.S. government funded West Africa Cotton Improvement Program (WACIP) in support of activities that focus on [[Agricultural diversification|crop diversification]] and value-added processing.&lt;ref name=fas/&gt;

===Food grains ===
[[File:Carabane-Rizières.JPG|thumb|300px|A rice paddy near [[Carabane]] after the harvest.]]
[[File:PICT5435.JPG|thumb|300px|Threshing [[millet]] in Malem-Hodar.]]

[[Rice]], [[millet]] and [[sorghum]] are the main subsistence [[food crop]]s for Senegal's rural population. [[Maize|Corn]] and [[fonio]] are also important [[cereal crop]]s. Production of cereal food crops, such as rice, millet, corn and sorghum - which is often grown in rotation with peanuts - does not meet Senegal's needs. Only in years of good [[rainfall]] does the country approach self-sufficiency in millet, corn, sorghum and fonio, the main staples in rural areas. Local production increased significantly in the early 2000s following the government's decision to subsidise fertilizer &lt;ref name=subsidy&gt;http://fsg.afre.msu.edu/inputs/Rapport_Synth%C3%A8se%20Etude%20Engrais_Version%20finale_juil.pdf USAID Senegal Projet Croissance Economique - Analyse de la filiere engrais au senegal et de son evolution sur la periode 2000-2010.  Mamadou Faye, Jean Pierre Ndiaye, Amadou Abdoulaye Fall, and Valerie Kelly, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; and encourage corn production, and thus reduce reliance upon peanuts.&lt;ref name=fas/&gt;

In 2005/06, total production of cereals (including milled rice) is estimated at 1,177,782 MT, which will cover some 60% of the consumption needs. However, given the segmentation of the rice market (see GAIN SG6002), this production will less likely affect [[import]]s. However, in years of poor rainfall and other natural disasters, the shortfall in coarse grains, especially millet, could be more difficult to cover because of low availability and [[trade]] of this grain in the region. Such constraints have been overcome with an increase in rice imports, with a shift from millet to rice consumption in households who can afford it.&lt;ref name=fas/&gt;

Senegal is the second largest rice importer in Africa, ahead of [[Côte d'Ivoire]] and behind [[Nigeria]]. Senegal's imports reached 1,113,000 MT in 2005, with net imports estimated at 854,000 MT. Consumers’ preference is for 100 percent broken rice originating from Asia, mainly [[Thailand]] and India, and recently{{When|date=February 2011}} from Brazil, [[Uruguay]] and [[Argentina]]. Per capita rice consumption continues to grow and is estimated at 70 to 75 kilograms and total annual consumption is estimated at 700,000 MT. Local rice production meets about 20 percent of the country's needs and 30 percent of this production is used for subsistence. In 2005/06, local production of rice paddy was estimated at 265,000 MT.&lt;ref name=fas/&gt;

The [[wheat]] sector has been controlled for years by two flourmills, Grands Moulins de Dakar and Sentenac, which buy about 90 percent of their wheat from France. (See SG7002) In 2001, NMA&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mbendi.com/orgs/dm5c.htm&lt;/ref&gt; became the country's third flour and feed mill. The demand for wheat flour is increasing, as the demand for bread increases along with population growth and changes in consumption habits. Senegal has imported 326,287 MT of wheat in 2005 and more than half of this quantity in the first half of 2006 (180,514 MT).&lt;ref name=fas/&gt;

Senegal imported United States wheat most recently in 2004 and again in 2006, making the U.S. the third largest supplier after France and Argentina. U.S. wheat is used for blending because of its high protein content compared to French soft wheat. Despite significant increases in the price of wheat in the international markets, the government froze flour and bread prices in November 2006, following strong pressure from consumers’ unions. The [[miller]]s’ price of flour is currently [[CFA Franc|CFA]] 264,000 per MT and the price of a [[baguette]] remains at CFA 150 instead of CFA 175 proposed by [[baker]]s’ associations. ($1 = CFA 507 on January 10, 2007.)&lt;ref name=fas/&gt;

===Horticultural products===
[[File:SenegalAgri.JPG|thumb|300px|Vegetables and fruit sold at [[M'bour]].]]
[[File:Pépinières d'oignons.JPG|thumb|upright|Onion fields in Ndiawar, Senegal.]]

Senegal's total horticultural production was estimated at 584,000 MT in 2004. Exports of fruits and vegetables are growing steady although they remain low, and it is estimated that they will reach approximately 50,000 tons in 2007. Europe is still the main export market for Senegal's fresh fruits and vegetables. About 70% of the European market is dominated by four products including green beans, cherry tomato, mango and melon. With the increase in size and value of the European market, pre-packed produce such as green beans have promising prospects in the European market and with the possibility to introduce first-stage processing, these produce will likely reach other markets. Under AGOA and its related projects, Senegal's horticultural sector is making efforts to enter the U.S and North American markets.&lt;ref name=fas/&gt;

However, in order for Senegal to benefit from these opportunities, Senegal needs to address phytosanitary concerns, improve existing value chains (improved ocean transportation of green beans, extension of the market of cherry tomato, increase the competitiveness of melon and expand the seasonality of mango). The fruit and vegetable industry involves about twenty active companies grouped in two federations (ONAPES and SEPAS). Three companies are involved through the whole chain (production, packaging, trade) export more than 50% of the produce alone. About ten medium-size companies export 200 to 500 tons
and the other are small enterprises usually serve as suppliers to major exporters. A warehouse for fresh produce is built at Dakar's airport, and other infrastructure is being built to improve storage and transportation to Europe and thereby maintain quality and increase value.&lt;ref name=fas/&gt;

The potential for the production of industrial tomato is high, especially along Senegal River valley. However, the current level of production of double concentrate tomato paste does not meet Senegal's needs estimated at 18,000 tons. In 2003, total production of fresh tomato was estimated at 53,000 tons, which yielded about 8,000 tons of paste representing only about 45% of the domestic needs. SOCAS, the main processing company with the capacity of 15,000 tons, has been importing triple concentrate to cover the deficit (5,000 tons in 2004 and 2,000 in 2005).&lt;ref name=fas/&gt;

At the same time the imports of double concentrate are regularly increasing from 2,900 tons in 2003 to 5,500 tons in 2004. Agroline, the other major company has been operating since 2003 with a capacity of 3,300 tons of double concentrate, representing 7% of the tomato paste market. Agroline has been using imported or local triple concentrate which it processes and packages into double concentrate. This company is considering extending its market share through the establishment of a new agro-industrial plant in Taredji, northern Senegal which will produce triple concentrate from fresh tomatoes. This project will start in 2007. Farm gate industrial tomato prices and incentives will have to improve for Senegal to produce more of its paste from local tomatoes. The processors face stiff competition from imports of final products such as tomato sauces, juice and ketchup.&lt;ref name=fas/&gt;

The overall potential of the horticultural sector is limited by the presence of various pests (including fruit and white flies), and therefore needs technical assistance to develop in-country SPS capacity for meeting international standards, and infrastructure to increase the efficiency of surveillance and compliance. Senegal needs also to work with its regional partners to harmonize phytosanitary standards and procedures, strengthen pest surveillance and detection capabilities, including border inspection operations, develop risk assessment capability, and overcome other bottlenecks related to regulatory issues and the trade.&lt;ref name=fas/&gt;

===Sugar===
[[File:Sucrerie richard toll1.jpg|thumb|300px|The Compagnie Sucrière Sénégalaise sugar refinery at Richard-toll.]]

The production of [[sugar]] in Senegal started back in September 1972, when the Compagnie Sucrière Sénégalaise, CSS, produced its first sugar cubes. CSS benefits from a [[de facto]] [[monopoly]] and [[subsidies]] from the government, which maintain its capacity to plant and process [[sugar cane]], then refines and commercialize the sugar produced in the forms of cubes, powder and crystallized sugar. This year, CSS’ production is estimated at 800,000 tons of sugar cane, from which nearly 90,500 tons of sugar is produced. With an average yield of 120 [[ton]]s/[[hectare]], CSS cultivates 7,500 hectares of commercial cane on the Senegal River valley in northern Senegal. The company employs 3,000 permanent workers and 2,000 seasonal workers.&lt;ref name=fas/&gt;

During the period 2002&amp;ndash;2005 CSS faced serious competition from illegal imports of cheaper sugar, mainly from [[Mauritania]] which grows cane and processes sugar in the same river valley on the other side of the border. These imports were estimated at 30,000 to 40,000 tons. These imports have decreased significantly in 2006 according to CSS authorities with the support of [[Customs]] services. CSS’ ambition is to increase its production meet the national consumption level of 150,000 tons of sugar. This will require a production of 923,000 to 1 million tons of cane. CSS is reported to have the processing capacity to reach this level of production but it will have to increase its cultivated area by 500 hectares. Currently CSS imports 33,000 tons of sugar to compensate the deficit. In 2006, these imports costed about $875 thousand to the company.&lt;ref name=fas/&gt;

===Livestock===
The [[livestock]] population includes 3.1 million [[cattle]] and 8.7 million [[sheep]] and [[goats]]. Most cattle systems using feed lots. Despite a significant livestock population, [[Senegal]] remains a net importer of [[meat]], especially live sheep during periods of peak consumption (major religious holidays and events). The total production of meat was about 100,000 [[ton]]s in 2003, which is equivalent to a per capita consumption of 11.5 [[kg]] below the government's objective of 14&amp;nbsp;kg.&lt;ref name=fas/&gt;

===Dairy products===
In Senegal, the [[milk]] industry is primarily based on the use of imported [[milk powder]]. Senegal's milk production is far below the domestic needs. Despite relatively high tariffs on milk powder (26.78%), about 20,000 tons of milk powder is imported each year, primarily from Europe. In fluid milk equivalent, imports represent twice the level of local milk production. Imports of other dairy products are estimated at about $100 million in 2006. Importers of powder milk form a strong political [[lobbying|lobby]] and dominate the dairy industry. Local producers are not well organized except the few modern producers in the major cities.&lt;ref name=fas/&gt;

Part of the import milk powder is processed and marketed through informal channels on which little information is reported. The main products available in the market are sweet concentrate milk, unsweetened concentrated milk, milk powder (in bulk or packaged in bottle or small bags). A few companies produce [[yogurt]].&lt;ref name=fas/&gt;

The local milk production system relies on climatic conditions with higher production during the [[rainy season]] and a slow down and even stoppage during the 7-month-long [[dry season]]. [[Non governmental organization]]s and donors assist small rural milk producers to improve the distribution systems and increase their capacity to access urban markets. In this perspective, PAPEL, the government's main livestock and dairy development project has rehabilitated the rural milk collection network set up by Nestlé-Senegal in 1991 in the sylvo-pastoral zone.&lt;ref name=fas/&gt;

This project is helping develop small-scale milk processing units with simple equipment and techniques. Most of these units are found in the Northern and Southern parts of the country, particularly in and around [[Saint-Louis, Senegal|Saint-Louis]], [[Dahra]], [[Tambacounda]], [[Velingara]] and [[Kolda]]. In the Niayes zone around [[Dakar]], other well structured milk processing units benefit from this support and were able to commercialize up to 300,000 liters of milk in Dakar in 2005. The most important of these milk farms are the Wayembam farm and the farms of the Regional Association of Women Cattle Breeders, Dirtel. Other major players in the milk market include Nestlé-Senegal, SATREC, CCMB, Saprolait, and Les Mamelles Jaboot.&lt;ref name=fas/&gt;

===Poultry ===
The [[poultry]] industry has been increasing its overall production since the announcement in 2005 of the ban of imports of chicken meat and despite the shock created in early 2006 by [[avian influenza]]. The sector represents 17% of the animal industry's contribution to [[GDP]] and employs about 10,000 people.&lt;ref name=fas/&gt;

In 2003, there were 3.2 millions chicken producing 5,982 tons of meat. Because of massive imports of low quality and cheap chicken parts from Europe and Brazil the sector decreased its production by 24% from 2001 to 2003. This has prompted the creation of poultry farmers' unions who claimed the loss of 3,000 to 5,000 jobs, and the government decision to ban imports of frozen chicken in October 2005. This ban is still underway and applies to all countries. As the result of this ban, local production increased by 21%. However, because the ban was only effective in January 2006, import orders prior to the ban were authorized and in 2004, 13,700 tons of chicken meat were imported.&lt;ref name=fas/&gt;

Local production is estimated at 7 million chickens in 2005, which represents a 33% increase compared to 2004. Chicken meat production represents about 75% of this production, and total industrial production of chicken meat has increased to 9,200 tons in 2005, representing a 26% increase compared to 2004. Traditional production (home production) is difficult to evaluate but could be estimated at 8,000 tons of meat. Preliminary government reports suggest that these trends will continue in 2006 with significant increase in local production of chicken meat. However, these trends also suggest that the production of eggs will decrease significantly as the result of the competing chicken meat, and professionals fear that the sector might not be able to meet Senegal's needs in chicken eggs, which may prompt a partial lift of the ban.&lt;ref name=fas/&gt;

Most of the inputs of chicken feed are imported. In 2005, about 85,000 MT of chicken feed were produced. [[Maize|Corn]] accounts for 60% of ingredients. Producers prefer [[soy]] and corn products to peanut cakes because of their better quality and lower costs. [[Fish]] meal is another available and important source of [[protein]] for the industry. In 2005 the cost of feeding accounted for 59% of poultry [[farm]]s’ total expenditures, which make the sector less competitive vis-à-vis imported poultry products.&lt;ref name=fas/&gt;

Senegal exports chicken meat to [[Guinea Bissau]] (194 Mt in 2005) and day-old chickens to [[The Gambia]], [[Mauritania]], [[Mali]], [[Burkina Faso]] and [[Guinea Bissau]] (238,250 in 2005).&lt;ref name=fas/&gt;

===Fisheries ===
[[File:SenegalFishing2.jpg|thumb|250px|Fishermen in Senegal.]]
The fishing sector benefits from a long coastline (approximately 448 miles) and a productive continental shelf area of approximately 9,653 square miles. Industrial fishing consists of sardine, tuna and trawler harvesting (shrimp, mullet, sole, cuttlefish, etc.). "Artisanal" catches are mainly for the local market with a large proportion purchased by local factories
for processing. Senegal's fishing sector has historically been one of the country's largest sources of foreign currency.&lt;ref name=fas/&gt;

In 2005, seafood products represented 22 percent of Senegal's total exports and generated more than $366 million in national income from an annual catch of approximately 40,000 tons, against approximately $374 million for a catch of approximately 430,000 tons in 2004. The [[fishing industry]] is also a key sector for employment. At the local level, thousands of families depend on fish as a nutritional staple. The Government estimates that the sector employs more than 200,000 people and generates significant temporary employment in the informal sector, in particular through the artisanal fishing, using lines, traps, and nets with small-scale traditional fishing canoes.&lt;ref name=fas/&gt;

The European Union is the largest market for Senegal's seafood exports. Senegal signed seventeen agreements with EU allowing EU fishing craft access to Senegalese water while setting export quotas and limits, and requiring that part of the catch, especially tuna, is supplied to local processing industries. The 2002&amp;ndash;2006 Senegal/EU agreement, which provided for an annual compensation of $15 million to the Government of Senegal, expired in June 2006. Negotiations to renew it are currently suspended following strong denunciation of previous agreements by Senegalese fishermen's associations for alleged [[overexploitation]]
of high-value fish, declining incomes, and limiting the availability of high value fish in the local markets. The Government of Senegal and local environmental organizations have also expressed concerns about the possible permanent ecological damage caused by the more sophisticated and efficient EU fleets.&lt;ref name=fas/&gt;

Several large Senegalese fish processing companies have ceased operations because of Senegal's small and unproductive fishing fleet, high costs of production, over-exploitation and scarcity of high value fish, and lack of investment resources. This crisis is reported to be one of the main causes of clandestine emigration from Senegal's major fishing communities to Europe over the last two years with the death of hundreds of young people, mostly fishermen.&lt;ref name=fas/&gt;

===Forest products===
In Senegal, the contribution of forest and other natural resources to the economy is not visible although it is real and important. The potential production of fauna and forest products is high and diversified but this sector is not fully accounted for in the macroeconomic indicators. Officially, the sector represents less than 1% of GDP. However the production of forest resources, mainly charcoal and wildlife, is estimated at $50 million yearly.&lt;ref name=fas/&gt;

Data collected in 2006 by UICN from producers, brokers and consumers of wild plant and animal products indicate that most of non-wood plants, wild animals, and continental fish are commercialized and only a small proportion is used for consumption. The economic importance of forest products varies by region but they account for up to 50% of the revenues of poor rural households. The value of these products, which usually are not included in the national statistics, is estimated at least $19 to $35 million. Gum arabic exports, which are not included in the about figures, soared to over $280 million in 2006.&lt;ref name=fas/&gt;

==Production resources and inputs ==
The construction of the [[Diama Dam|Diama]] and [[Manantali Dam]]s in 1986 created an additional 240,000 hectares of land which can be irrigated on the Senegalese side of the [[Senegal River]] in northern Senegal. This gave the country the potential to diversify its crop base and increase food production. However, operation of the upstream dam has also reduced annual floods along the floodplain, where an ancient and productive form of recessional irrigation has been practiced for hundreds of years. Recessional irrigation is still practiced along these flood plains for an estimated 50,000 hectares.&lt;ref name=fas/&gt;

The best agricultural land along the Senegal River is in the [[wikt:alluvial|alluvial]] valley between [[Bakel, Senegal|Bakel]] and [[Dagana, Senegal|Dagana]], and this area is the most densely populated part of the valley. As the floods retreat each year, a variety of crops (including millet, sorghum, rice, and vegetables) are sown, and they grow and mature quickly. These areas also provide pasture for livestock. But because rainfall has been lower in [[Guinea]] in 2006, the water table of the Senegal River and its effluents was at a critical level and comparable to a dry year as of early 2007. This situation was expected to limit recession and dry season productions.&lt;ref name=fas/&gt;

In addition, pests such as insects and locusts have been reported on peanuts, cowpeas, and sorghum. In northern Senegal, rice production will likely be seriously affected this year by the extensive invasion of grain eating birds - the [[red-billed quelea]] (''Quelea quelea'').&lt;ref name=fas/&gt;

During this growing season the Government has subsidized the agricultural sector at a level of about $40 million. This investment included the purchase of 40,000 tons of peanut seeds, payments to peanut producers of up to $10 million, the purchase of seeds of special crops such as sesame, cassava, corn, and hisbiscus sabdarifa (bissap), and for the subsidy of fertilizers. The government has also contributed $10 million for the purchase of farming equipment.&lt;ref name=fas/&gt;

==Agricultural policies and institutional framework==

=== Agricultural policies ===
Senegal's agricultural policies are historically characterized by the following key features: The government agricultural support system is mainly based on cash crops that have reliable markets. Agricultural research has significantly contributed in maintaining productivity despite irregular rainfall and poor soils. Liberalization of the market of agricultural produce in early 1990 has improved the efficiency of the cereal market.&lt;ref name=fas/&gt;

The impact of the liberalization has been limited because peanuts still dominate the market; integrated extension, input distribution, credit, and marketing support systems contribute in boosting productivity, especially cash crops and government promoted new crops; yet, support to farmers is costly and inefficient, particularly because the government responds more to political pressure than to economically motivated schemes; literacy programs are not devoted due attention in rural areas, and this limits the efficiency of extension and farm-level adoption of technologies, and therefore farmers capacity to respond to market dynamics.&lt;ref name=fas/&gt;

In response to increasing rural migration and clandestine emigration, the government has recently{{When|date=February 2011}} launched a new plan, called REVA ("Return to Agriculture"). The objective of this program is to develop agricultural infrastructure (construction of rural roads, rehabilitation of wells, and connection to electricity) and provide training and production tools and equipment to young and women farmers, especially former clandestine emigrants. The pilot phase of the program started in August 2006 and will end in December 2008, and during this period the government plans to implement 550 production sites.{{update after|2008|12|31}} This plan is gaining increasing support from donors.&lt;ref name=fas/&gt;

=== Government ministries ===
The institutional framework of the agricultural sector is organized through two main ministries. The Ministry of Agriculture, biofuels and Food Security which includes the Directorate of Agriculture responsible for the implementation of food grains and agro-
industrial development policies and for overseeing the field based extension services; the Directorate of Horticulture which coordinates government support to the horticultural sector; the Directorate of Agricultural Census; and the Directorate of Plant Protection responsible for government pest control programs, including regulations, management of standards, and
various field interventions. The second ministry involved in the agricultural sector is the Ministry of Animal Husbandry with several services coordinating government support to the livestock, dairy and poultry sub-sectors.&lt;ref name=fas/&gt;

These services are completed by research and training institutions. ISRA (Senegalese Agricultural Research Institute) is the leading agricultural research institution and works on various issues related to crop and animal production, SPS and veterinary issues, fishing and forest products and rural socio-economy. Other major research institutions are ITA (Food
Technology Institute), CDH (horticultural research) and WARDA (The Africa Rice Center). Senegal has also agricultural and veterinary colleges which provide most of human resources used in the sector. The main schools are ENSA (the Agricultural College), EISMV (The Inter-states Veterinary College), and CDH (The Horticultural Development Training Center).&lt;ref name=fas/&gt;

=== Major international donors ===
Major donors involved in the agricultural sector in Senegal include FAO, USAID, USDA, the World Bank, the African Development Bank, the West African Development Bank, the French government, Peace Corps and several other local and international NGOs.&lt;ref name=fas/&gt;

An '''autocatalytic set''' is a collection of entities, each of which can be created [[catalysis|catalytically]] by other entities within the set, such that as a whole, the set is able to catalyze its own production.  In this way the set ''as a whole'' is said to be [[autocatalysis|autocatalytic]].   Autocatalytic sets were originally and most concretely defined in terms of [[molecular entity|molecular entities]], but have more recently been metaphorically extended to the study of systems in [[sociology]] and [[economics]].

Autocatalytic sets also have the ability to replicate themselves if they are split apart into two physically separated spaces. Computer models illustrate that split autocatalytic sets will reproduce all of the reactions of the original set in each half, much like cellular [[mitosis]]. In effect, using the principles of autocatalysis, a small metabolism can replicate itself with very little high level organization. This property is why autocatalysis is a contender as the foundational mechanism for complex evolution.

Prior to [[James D. Watson|Watson]] and [[Francis Crick|Crick]], biologists considered autocatalytic sets the way [[metabolism]] functions in principle, i.e. one [[protein]] helps to synthesize another protein and so on. After the discovery of the [[double helix]], the [[central dogma of molecular biology]] was formulated, which is that [[DNA]] is transcribed to [[RNA]] which is translated to protein. The molecular structure of DNA and RNA, as well as the metabolism that maintains their reproduction, are believed to be too complex to have arisen spontaneously in one step from a soup of chemistry.

Several models of the [[origin of life]] are based on the notion that life may have arisen through the development of an initial molecular autocatalytic set which evolved over time.  Most of these models which have emerged from the studies of [[complex system]]s predict that life arose not from a molecule with any particular trait (such as self-replicating [[RNA World|RNA]]) but from an autocatalytic set. The first empirical support came from Lincoln and Joyce, who obtained autocatalytic sets in which "two [RNA] enzymes catalyze each other’s synthesis from a total of four component substrates."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Lincoln TA, Joyce GF | title = Self-sustained replication of an RNA enzyme | journal = Science | volume = 323 | issue = 5918 | pages = 1229–32 |date=February 2009 | pmid = 19131595 | pmc = 2652413 | doi = 10.1126/science.1167856 | url = | issn = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, an evolutionary process that began with a population of these self-replicators yielded a population dominated by [[Genetic recombination|recombinant]] replicators.

Modern life has the traits of an autocatalytic set, since no particular molecule, nor any class of molecules, is able to replicate itself. There are several models based on autocatalytic sets, including those of [[Stuart Kauffman]]&lt;ref&gt;Kauffman, Stuart A. (2008) ''Reinventing the Sacred: A New View of Science, Reason, and Religion''.  [Basic Books] - {{ISBN|0-465-00300-1}}, chapter 5, especially pp.59-71&lt;/ref&gt; and others.

==Formal definition==

===Definition===

Given a set M of [[molecule]]s, [[chemical reaction]]s can be roughly defined as pairs r = (A, B) of subsets from M:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Hordijk W | title = Autocatalytic Sets: From the Origin of Life to the Economy | journal = BioScience | volume = 63 | issue = 11 | pages =  877–881| year = 2013 | month = | pmid =  | pmc =  | doi = 10.1525/bio.2013.63.11.6 | url = http://bioscience.oxfordjournals.org/content/63/11/877.abstract | issn = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

  a&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + a&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + ... + a&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt; → b&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + b&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + ... + b&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;

Let R be the set of allowable reactions. A pair (M, R) is a ''reaction system'' (RS).

Let C be the set of molecule-reaction pairs specifying which molecules can [[catalyst|catalyze]] which reactions:

  C = {(m, r) | m ∈ M, r ∈ R}

Let F ⊆ M be a set of ''food'' (small numbers of molecules freely available from the environment) and R' ⊆ R be some subset of reactions. We define a [[closure (mathematics)|closure]] of the food set relative to this subset of reactions Cl&lt;sub&gt;R'&lt;/sub&gt;(F) as the set of molecules that contains the food set plus all molecules that can be produced starting from the food set and using only reactions from this subset of reactions. Formally Cl&lt;sub&gt;R'&lt;/sub&gt;(F) is a minimal subset of M such that F ⊆ Cl&lt;sub&gt;R'&lt;/sub&gt;(F) and for each reaction r'(A, B) ⊆ R':

  A ⊆ Cl&lt;sub&gt;R'&lt;/sub&gt;(F) ⇒ B ⊆ Cl&lt;sub&gt;R'&lt;/sub&gt;(F)

A reaction system (Cl&lt;sub&gt;R'&lt;/sub&gt;(F), R') is ''autocatalytic'', if and only if for each reaction r'(A, B) ⊆ R':
# there exists a molecule c ⊆ Cl&lt;sub&gt;R'&lt;/sub&gt;(F) such that (c, r') ⊆ C,
# A ⊆ Cl&lt;sub&gt;R'&lt;/sub&gt;(F).

===Example===

Let M = {a, b, c, d, f, g} and F = {a, b}. Let the set R contains the following reactions:

  a + b  → c + d, catalyzed by g
  a + f  → c + b, catalyzed by d
  c + b  → g + a, catalyzed by d or f

From the F = {a, b} we can produce {c, d} and then from {c, b} we can produce {g, a} so the closure is equal to:

  Cl&lt;sub&gt;R'&lt;/sub&gt;(F) = {a, b, c, d, g}

According to the definition the maximal autocatalytic subset R' will consists of two reactions:

  a + b  → c + d, catalyzed by g
  c + b  → g + a, catalyzed by d

The reaction for (a + f) does not belong to R' because f does not belong to closure. Similarly the reaction for (c + b) in the autocatalytic set can only be catalyzed by d and not by f.

==Probability that a random set is autocatalytic==

Studies of the above model show that random RS can be autocatalytic with high probability under some assumptions. This comes from the fact that with a growing number of molecules, the number of possible reactions and catalysations grows even larger if the molecules grow in complexity, producing stochastically enough reactions and catalysations to make a part of the RS self-supported.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Mossel E, Steel M. | title = Random biochemical networks and the probability of self-sustaining autocatalysis | journal = Journal of Theoretical Biology | volume = 233 | issue = 3 | pages = 327–336 | year = 2005 | month = | pmid =  15652142| pmc =  | doi = 10.1016/j.jtbi.2004.10.011| url = | issn = }}&lt;/ref&gt; An autocatalytic set then extends very quickly with growing number of molecules
for the same reason. These theoretical results make autocatalytic sets attractive for scientific explanation of the very early origin of life.

==Formal limitations==

Formally, it is difficult to treat molecules as anything but unstructured
entities, since the set of possible reactions (and molecules) would become infinite. Therefore, a derivation of arbitrarily long [[polymer]]s as needed to model DNA, RNA or proteins is not possible, yet. Studies of the [[RNA World]] suffer from the same problem.

==Linguistic aspects==

Contrary to the above definition, which applies to the field of [[Artificial chemistry]],
no agreed-upon notion of autocatalytic sets exists today.

While above, the notion of catalyst is secondary insofar that only the set as
a whole has to catalyse its own production, it is primary in other definitions,
giving the term "Autocatalytic Set" a different emphasis. There, ''every'' reaction
(or function, transformation) has to be mediated by a catalyst. As a consequence,
while mediating its respective reaction, every catalyst ''denotes''
its reaction, too, resulting in a self denoting system, which is interesting
for two reasons. First, real metabolism is structured in this manner.
Second, self denoting systems can be considered as an intermediate step
towards self describing systems.

From both a structural and a natural historical point of view, one can
identify the ACS as seized in the formal definition the more original
concept, while in the second, the reflection of the system in itself is
already brought to an explicit presentation, since catalysts represent
the reaction induced by them. In ACS literature, both concept are present,
but differently emphasised.

To complete the classification from the other side, generalised self
reproducing systems move beyond self-denotation. There, no
unstructured entities carry the transformations anymore, but structured,
described ones. Formally, a generalised self reproducing system consists
of two function, u and c, together with their descriptions Desc(u) and
Desc(c) along following definition:

     u : Desc(X) -&gt; X
     c : Desc(X) -&gt; Desc(X)

where the function 'u' is the [[Von Neumann universal constructor|"universal" constructor]], that constructs
everything in its domain from appropriate descriptions, while 'c' is a copy
function for any description. Practically, 'u' and 'c' can fall apart into many subfunctions or catalysts.

Note that the (trivial) copy function 'c' is necessary because though the universal constructor 'u'
would be able to construct any description, too, the description it would base on, would in
general be longer than the result, rendering full self replication impossible.

This last concept can be attributed to [[John von Neumann|von Neumann]]'s
work on [[Self-replication|self reproducing]] automata, where he holds a self description necessary for any
nontrivial (generalised) self reproducing system to avoid interferences. Von Neumann planned to design
such a system for a model chemistry, too.

==Non-autonomous autocatalytic sets==

Virtually all articles on autocatalytic sets leave open whether the sets are
to be considered autonomous or not. Often, autonomy of the sets is silently
assumed.

Likely, the above context has a strong emphasis on autonomous self replication
and early origin of life. But the concept of autocatalytic sets is really more general and
in practical use in various technical areas, e.g. where self-sustaining tool chains are
handled. Clearly, such sets are not autonomous and are objects of human agency.

Examples of practical importance of non-autonomous autocatalytic sets can be found e.g. in the field of [[Bootstrapping (compilers)|compiler construction]] and in [[Self-hosting|operating systems]], where the self-referential nature of the respective constructions is explicitly discussed, very often as [[bootstrapping]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3520">'''Axe ties''' are railway [[Railroad tie|ties]] (or sleeper)&lt;ref&gt;"Railroad n." def. 3.c. ''Oxford English Dictionary'' Second Edition on CD-ROM (v. 4.0) © Oxford University Press 2009&lt;/ref&gt; that are [[Hewing|hewn]] by hand, usually with a [[broadaxe]]. There are 2,900 ties per mile of track on a first class railroad.{{Clarify|date=November 2009}} The early railways would not accept ties cut with a [[saw]], as it was claimed that the [[wiktionary:kerf|kerf]] of the saw splintered the fibres of the wood, leaving them more likely to soak up moisture causing premature [[Decomposition|rot]]. 

==The process==
Geoff Marples wrote an account of being a ''tiehack'' in the [[East Kootenay]]s in 1938 and described the process of making axe ties to include:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.for.gov.bc.ca/hfd/Library/Forest_History_Newsletter/60.pdf Marples, Geoff. "The Tiehack", part 1.. ''British Columbia Forest History Newsletter''. No. 60.] August 2000. Victoria, B. C.,  Forest History Association of British Columbia. p. 1-4. print.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.for.gov.bc.ca/hfd/Library/Forest_History_Newsletter/61.pdf Marples, Geoff. "The Tiehack", part 2.. ''British Columbia Forest History Newsletter''. No. 61.] December 2000. Victoria, B. C.,  Forest History Association of British Columbia. p. 1-4. print.&lt;/ref&gt; First a suitable tree was chosen and then [[felling|''falling'']] and ''[[limbing]]'' the tree. Next came ''scoring'' which is chopping, by eye without a chalk line, of notches to remove extra wood about every {{convert|10|in|cm}}; ''hewing'' the trunks only on two sides unless the log was over {{convert|11|in|cm}} in diameter; ''[[bucking]]'' (cutting to in this case {{convert|8|ft|m}}); ''peeling'' any remaining bark off; and stacking the ties so a chain can be wrapped around them. Next came ''[[Skidder|skidding]]'' each group of ties to a landing with a team of horses, and then loading and ''hauling'' the ties to a railway siding by truck and unloading by hand. [[Log scaler|''Scaling'']] was the key event where a railroad inspector accepted or culled (rejected) and graded each tie as a number one ({{convert|7|in|cm}} by {{convert|9|in|cm}} used for the main railroad lines) or number two ({{convert|6|in|cm}} by {{convert|6|in|cm}} used for sidings). ''Loading'' the {{convert|200|lb|kg}} ties by hand onto a car was the last task. Marples wrote that he netted 48 cents for each grade one, and 36 cents for each grade two and made $150 for a winters work.

==Wood species==
[[Thuja occidentalis|Cedar]] was the most sought after wood for ties, since it is known for being extremely resistant to rot. However, as [[Railway electrification system|electric power]] came into more common use in the early 1900s, it was substituted with other species such as [[Tamarack Larch|Tamarack]]. In northern regions where [[Jack Pine|jack pine]] was plentiful, that species became a more common source for railway ties. Jack pine ties did not last as long as cedar or tamarack (lying on the ground), but were cheaper to produce. As [[creosote]] treatment came into use the axe ties were phased out, but jack pine remained best suited for softwood ties.

==Production in Canada==
Axe tie production was an early industry of importance for many communities in [[Ontario]] along the railway in the early 1900s. Examples include [[Foleyet, Ontario|Foleyet]] and [[Nemegos, Ontario|Nemegos]].

'''Banpu Public Company Limited''' is a mining and power company in [[Thailand]]. It is the largest coal producer in Thailand&lt;ref name=BP-20180818/&gt; and also has [[coal mining]] operations in [[Indonesia]] and [[China]], and coal-fired [[Electricity generation|power generation]] operations in Thailand and China. Banpu plans also to invest in the Hong Sa [[lignite]] mine and power plant project in [[Laos]].&lt;ref name=nation&gt;{{cite web | work= The Nation | url= http://www.nationmultimedia.com/2007/03/31/business/business_30030721.php | title = Banpu Power seeks partner for Lao plant | date=2007-03-31 | accessdate=2008-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Banpu's main coal resources are in Indonesia (26 million tonnes), Australia (14 million tonnes), and China (4.7 million tonnes). It expects its sales to rise to 45 million tonnes in 2018, up from 42 million tonnes in 2017.&lt;ref name=BP-20180818&gt;{{cite news |last1=Praiwan |first1=Yuthana |title=Banpu predicts strong coal price |url=https://www.bangkokpost.com/business/news/1523138/banpu-predicts-strong-coal-price |accessdate=19 August 2018 |work=Bangkok Post |date=18 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Centennial Coal==
In 2010 Banpu bought the Australian mining company [[Centennial Coal Company Ltd]] which operates [[Coal companies of Australia|five mines]] in [[New South Wales]] (NSW) supplying coal for export and approximately 40 percent of NSW's coal-fired electricity.&lt;ref name=CCabout&gt;{{cite web|title=About Us; Who we are|url=http://www.centennialcoal.com.au/About-Us/Who-We-Are.aspx|website=Centennial Coal|accessdate=18 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company sells approximately 40 percent of its coal to export markets, primarily for use in power stations and steel mills in Japan, Korea, Taiwan and Europe.&lt;ref name=CCabout/&gt;

Centennial Coal has been responsible for more than 900 pollution notices between 2000 and 2013 from the NSW [[Office of Environment and Heritage (New South Wales)|Environment Protection Authority]] (EPA). In 2015 it was responsible for a major release of coal fines into the [[Wollangambe River]] and  World Heritage listed areas of the [[Blue Mountains National Park]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Clean up progressing for Wollangambe|url=http://www.epa.nsw.gov.au/epamedia/EPAMedia15073101.htm|website=NSW EPA|publisher=New South Wales Environment Protection Authority|accessdate=18 September 2015|date=2015-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Centennial Coal has been dumping mine effluent into the Wollangambe River for approximately 30 years, effectively killing large sections of it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Belmer|first1=Nakia|last2=Tippler|first2=Carl|last3=Davies|first3=Peter J.|last4=Wright|first4=Ian A.|title=Impact of a coal mine waste discharge on water quality and aquatic ecosystems in the Blue Mountains World Heritage area|journal=Proceedings of the 7th Australian Stream Management Conference|url=http://www.bluemountains.org.au/documents/campaigns/wollangambe/7ASM-67%20Belmer%20et%20al%20%20Coal%20mine%20(Final%2025%20July%202014).pdf|accessdate=18 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 2000-2015, Centennial's Clarence Colliery has been cited for more than 65 non-compliance breaches of its licence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Tan|first1=Monica|title=Coal miner's toxic wastes killing aquatic life in protected Blue Mountains river|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/jun/05/coal-miners-toxic-wastes-killing-aquatic-life-in-protected-blue-mountains-river|accessdate=4 January 2017|work=The Guardian|date=2015-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2015, Centennial Coal has applied to extend the Springvale Mine, undermining swamps of "National Environmental Significance"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Muir|first1=Keith|title=The Perversion of National Heritage Protection Threatened heritage subversion—Centennial Coal's swamp scam|url=http://www.colongwilderness.org.au/news/2015/perversion-national-heritage-protection|website=The Colong Foundation for Wilderness Ltd|accessdate=18 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and dumping up to 50 million litres a day of mine effluent into the [[Coxs River]] which also flows through the Blue Mountains World Heritage area and into [[Lake Burragorang|Sydney's drinking water catchments]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Court action to stop Springvale Mine polluting the Coxs River|url=https://www.colongwilderness.org.au/news/2016/court-action-stop-springvale-mine-polluting-coxs-river|website=The Colong Foundation for Wilderness Ltd|accessdate=4 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hong Sa Lignite==
The Hong Sa Lignite project was founded by and belonged to Thai-Lao Lignite Co., Ltd. (TLL) and Hong Sa Lignite (Lao PDR) Co., Ltd.  (HLL) pursuant to a concession from 1992-1994. In 2005, Banpu entered into a joint venture with TLL and HLL to develop the project, but this agreement was terminated in 2006. A [[United Nations Commission on International Trade Law|UNCITRAL]] arbitration found that the Lao government illegally terminated TLL's and HLL's concession (awarding it to Banpu) and ordered Laos to pay US$57 million in damages plus interest. Laos is refusing to pay the award despite its clear agreement with TLL and HLL, its government policy for international arbitration, and despite participating fully.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

[[File:Chicken_fat.jpg|thumb|right|Chicken fat]]
'''Chicken fat''' is [[fat]] obtained (usually as a [[by-product]]) from [[chicken]] [[Rendering (food processing)|rendering]] and [[Food processing|processing]]. Of the many [[Animal source foods|animal-sourced]] substances, chicken fat is noted for being high in [[linoleic acid]], an [[omega-6]] [[fatty acid]]. Linoleic acid levels are between 17.9% and 22.8%.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.springerlink.com/content/0837289583682243/ The chemical composition of depot fats in chickens and turkeys]. M. K. Nutter, E. E. Lockhart and R. S. Harris. 1943. Journal of the American Oil Chemists' Society. 20:11, pp. 231-234.&lt;/ref&gt; It is a common flavoring, additive or main component of [[chicken soup]]. It is often used in [[pet food]]s, and has been used in the production of [[biodiesel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/christopherhelman/2012/02/17/making-cars-carnivores-tyson-venture-turns-animal-fat-into-diesel/ |title=Making Cars Carnivores: Tyson Venture Turns Animal Fat Into Diesel |date=February 17, 2012 |work=www.forbes.com |accessdate=June 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; One method of converting chicken fat into biodiesel is through a process called supercritical methanol treatment.&lt;ref&gt;https://global.factiva.com/{{full citation needed|date=September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''coach''' is originally a large, usually closed, four-wheeled [[carriage]] with two or more horses harnessed as a ''team'', controlled by a [[coachman]] and/or one or more [[postilion]]s. It had doors in the sides, with generally a front and a back seat inside and, for the driver, a small, usually elevated seat in front called a ''box, box seat'' or '''coach box'''. The term "coach" first came into use in the 15th century, and spread across Europe. There are a number of types of coaches, with differentiations based on use, location and size. Special breeds of horses, such as the now-extinct [[Yorkshire Coach Horse]], were developed to pull the vehicles.

==History==
{{see also|Carriage}}
[[Image:Museu Nacional dos Coches (4) - Mar 2010.jpg|thumb|right|Ornate detail on one of the Portuguese Royal Coaches at the [[National Coach Museum]] in [[Lisbon]].]]
[[File:President Guðni Th. Jóhannesson in Stockholm 2018 (5 av 16).jpg|thumb|Coaches are nowadays also used on ceremonial occasions. Here, a coach is used to convey President [[Guðni Th. Jóhannesson]] of Iceland during a [[state visit]] to Sweden.]]

[[Kocs]] (pronounced "kotch") was the Hungarian post town in the 15th century onwards, which gave its name to a fast light vehicle, which later spread across Europe. Therefore, the English word ''coach'', the Spanish and Portuguese ''coche'', the German ''Kutsche'', and the Slovak '' koč'' and Czech ''kočár'' all probably derive from the [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] word "kocsi", literally meaning "of Kocs".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/coach coach] definition in CollinsDictionary.com. Collins English Dictionary&amp;nbsp;– Complete &amp; Unabridged 11th Edition. Retrieved November 12, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/coach Definition "coach" in Merriam-Webster Dictionary].&lt;/ref&gt;

It was not until about the middle of the reign of Queen [[Elizabeth I]], that coaches were introduced to England. Coaches were reputedly introduced into England from France by [[Henry FitzAlan, 19th Earl of Arundel]].&lt;ref name="google"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Percy Anecdotes|author1=Percy, S.|author2=Percy, R.|date=1823|issue=19. k.|publisher=T. Boys|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rvkxAQAAMAAJ|page=54|accessdate=2014-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A coach with four horses is a '''coach-and-four'''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thefreedictionary.com/coach-and-four Definition of coach-and-four by the Free Online Dictionary, Thesaurus and Encyclopedia.] Free access.&lt;/ref&gt; A coach together with the horses, harness and attendants is a '''turnout'''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.m-w.com/dictionary/turn+out Turn out&amp;nbsp;– Definition from the Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The bodies of early coaches were hung on leather straps. In the eighteenth century steel springs were substituted, an improvement in [[Suspension (vehicle)|suspension]]. An advertisement in the ''[[Edinburgh Courant]]'' for 1754 reads:
&lt;blockquote&gt;''The Edinburgh stage-coach, for the better accommodation of passengers, will be altered to a new genteel two-end glass coach-machine, hung on steel springs, exceedingly light and easy...''&lt;/blockquote&gt;
In the mid 19th century American [[Concord stagecoach]]es used leather straps in a similar way.

A coach might have a built-in compartment called a ''boot'', used originally as a seat for the coachman and later for storage. A luggage case for the top of a coach was called an ''imperial''; the top, roof or second-story compartment of a coach was also known as an imperial.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thefreedictionary.com/imperial Definition of imperial by the Free Online Dictionary, Thesaurus and Encyclopedia.] Free access.&lt;/ref&gt;  The front and rear [[axle]]s were connected by a main shaft called the ''perch'' or ''reach''. A crossbar known as a ''splinter bar'' supported the springs. Coaches were often decorated by painters using a sable brush called a ''liner''.

In the 19th century the name coach was used for U.S. [[Coach (rail)|railway carriages]],&lt;ref&gt;Oxford English Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt; and in the 20th century to [[Coach (vehicle)|motor coaches]].

See [[John Taylor (poet)]] for a very adverse opinion of the arrival of horsedrawn coaches in England.

==Types of coaches==
[[File:The Drag of the Duke of Beaufort (18416040161).jpg|thumb|left|Drag of His Grace the Duke of Beaufort, president of the Four-in-Hand [[Driving club|Driving Club]]]]
[[File:Eakins, Fairman Rogers Four-in-Hand (May Morning in Park) 1880.jpg|thumb|''[[The Fairman Rogers Four-in-Hand]]'', by [[Thomas Eakins]], [[Fairmount Park]], Philadelphia, 1880]]
[[File:Final Judging of the Coaching Marathon (3716748680) (cropped).jpg|thumb|Pleasure driving 2009&lt;br&gt;Marathon competition [[Stoneleigh Park]]]]
There are a number of coach types, including but not limited to:
*'''Coach''': a large heavy vehicle designed to carry passengers
*'''State coach''': A coach of state is used to carry very important persons, like a visiting president of China, royalty and (antique) high nobility such as princes and dukes on state occasions.
*'''Private coach''': a very expensive cumbersome 17th century luxury replaced as they were developed by light fast carriages except on formal occasions.
*'''Road coach''': a private coach kept for pleasure. See [[Driving club]]
*'''Drag''' or (U.S.) '''Park drag''':  a gentleman's coach kept for pleasure. See [[Driving club]]

The principal ceremonial coaches in the United Kingdom are the '''[[Gold State Coach]]''', '''[[Irish State Coach]]''' and '''[[Scottish State Coach]]'''.
===Coaches for public hire or transport===
&lt;!--*'''[[Fly (carriage)|fly]]''': horse-drawn, public - not a coach--&gt;
*'''funeral coach''':&lt;!--or is this a coach for mourners following a hearse?--&gt; not a coach but a U.S. name for a [[hearse]], a wagon adapted to carry a coffin
&lt;!--*'''[[Hackney carriage]]''': a hired carriage - if its a carriage its a carriage if its a hackney coach that would be different--&gt;&lt;!--a hack is a horse--&gt;
*'''hackney coach''' a hired coach
&lt;!--*'''[[Fiacre (carriage)|fiacre]]''': small !--?-- not a coach--&gt;

**'''[[Mail coach]]''' or '''post coach''':  same as a stagecoach, used for carrying mail but it carries premium-fare passengers and keeps to a very fast and precise schedule
**'''[[Concord stagecoach]]''': as stagecoach —  but its unique U.S. design with its body swung on leather thorough-braces was to help cope with very bad U.S. roads
**'''[[Stage wagon]]''' or '''mud wagon''': (U.S.) lighter and smaller than a stagecoach, flat sides, simpler joinery
&lt;!--*'''[[tally-ho#Coach|Tally-ho]]''': a four-in-hand  (U.S.) a [[charabanc]]!--?-- not a coach--&gt;

==Coach miscellany==
[[File:Museu Nacional dos Coches (2) - Mar 2010.jpg|thumb|A Portuguese Royal Coach driver's uniform]]
[[File:LeMailFrancais1906.jpg|thumb|Park Drag Paris 1906]]
The business of a '''coachman''' &lt;!--(or coachee), formerly coacher) it says above a coachee is shaped like a coach but longer and open in front--&gt; like the pilot of an aircraft was to expertly direct and take all responsibility for a coach or carriage and its horses, their stabling feeding and maintenance and the associated staff. He was also called a ''[[wikt:jarvey|jarvey]]'' or ''jarvie'', especially in [[Ireland]]; Jarvey was a nickname for Jarvis. 

If he drove dangerously fast or recklessly he was a ''jehu'' (from [[Jehu]], king of [[History of ancient Israel and Judah|Israel]], who was noted for his furious attacks in a [[chariot]] (2 [[Books of Kings|Kings]] 9:20), or a ''Phaeton'' (from Greek [[Phaethon]], son of [[Helios]], who attempted to drive the chariot of the sun but managed to set the earth on fire). 

A ''postilion'' or ''[[postillion]]'' sometimes rode as a guide on the near horse of a pair or of one of the pairs attached to a coach, especially when there was no coachman. A guard on a horse-drawn coach was called a ''shooter''.

Traveling by coach, or pleasure driving in a coach, as in a [[tally-ho#Coach|tally-ho]], was called '''coaching'''. In driving a coach, the coachman used a '''[[whip#Buggy whip and coachwhip|coachwhip]]''', usually provided with a long lash. Experienced coachmen never used the lash on their horses. They used the whip to flick the ear of the leader to give them the office to move on, or cracked it next to their heads to request increased speed. 

*'''box coat''': a heavy overcoat with or without shoulder capes used by coachmen (riding on the box seat) exposed to all kinds of weather.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.probertencyclopaedia.com/cgi-bin/res.pl?keyword=Box+Coat&amp;offset=0 Box Coat.] Probert Encyclopaedia.&lt;/ref&gt; 
*'''hammercloth''': ornamented and often fringed was hung over the coachman's seat, especially on a ceremonial coach.&lt;ref&gt;Hammercloth in Merriam-Webster Unabridged Dictionary (2000).&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''cockhorse''':  An extra horse led behind a coach to be hitched when passing over steep or difficult terrain.
* '''[[stable]]''' was a building to shelter horses usually close to the owner's house. Staff accommodation would be close often within the same building.
* '''coach house''' was a special building for sheltering a coach or coaches but coaches were more often kept within the stable building.
* '''[[coaching inn]]''' or '''coaching house'''  provided accommodation for travellers and usually provided a change of horses and offered stabling.
*'''coach dog''' or '''carriage dog''' was trained to run in attendance on a coach particularly [[Dalmatian (dog)|Dalmatian]]s.

==Coach horses==
A '''coach horse''' or '''coacher''' bred for drawing a coach is typically heavier and of more compact build than a road horse &lt;!-- a road horse?--&gt; and exhibits good style and action.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.georgianindex.net/horse_and_carriage/carriage-breeds.html Detailed information about specific breeds of horses: Carriage Horses in Britain.] Georgian Index.&lt;/ref&gt; Breeds include:
*'''[[Breton (horse)|Breton]]''': heavy, French, for draft or meat
*'''German coach''': large, rather coarse, heavy [[draft horse]] or harness horse; bay, brown or black in color
*'''[[Hanoverian (horse)|Hanoverian]]''': developed by crossing heavy cold-blooded German horses with Thoroughbreds
*'''[[Holstein (horse)|Holstein]]''': German, heavyweight, for riding and dressage, initially a carriage horse; bay, black or brown. Called also ''Holsteiner, Warmblut, Warmblood''.
*'''[[Yorkshire Coach Horse]]''': large, strong, bay or brown; dark legs, mane and tail; belongs to an English breed derived largely from the [[Cleveland Bay]]

{{Portal|Energy}}
'''Crack spread''' is a term used on the [[oil industry]] and [[futures contract|futures trading]] for the differential between the price of [[crude oil]] and [[petroleum product]]s extracted from it. The spread approximates the [[profit margin]] that an [[oil refinery]] can expect to make by "[[Cracking (chemistry)|cracking]]" the long-chain hydrocarbons of crude oil into useful shorter-chain petroleum products.

In the futures markets, the "crack spread" is a specific [[spread trade]] involving simultaneously buying and selling contracts in [[crude oil]] and one or more derivative products, typically [[gasoline]] and [[heating oil]]. [[Oil refineries]] may trade a crack spread to [[Hedge (finance)|hedge]] the [[price risk]] of their operations, while [[speculator]]s attempt to profit from changes in the oil/gasoline price differential.

==Factors affecting the crack spread==
One of the most important factors affecting the crack spread is the relative proportion of various petroleum products produced by a refinery.  Refineries produce many products from crude oil, including [[gasoline]], [[kerosene]], [[Diesel fuel|diesel]], [[heating oil]], [[aviation fuel]], [[asphalt]] and others. To some degree, the proportion of each product produced can be varied in order to suit the demands of the local market. Regional differences in the demand for each refined product depend upon the relative demand for fuel for heating, cooking or transportation purposes. Within a region, there can also be seasonal differences in demand for heating fuel versus transportation fuel.

The mix of refined products is also affected by the particular blend of crude oil feedstock processed by a refinery, and by the capabilities of the refinery. Heavier crude oils contain a higher proportion of heavy [[hydrocarbon]]s composed of longer carbon chains. As a result, [[heavy crude oil]] is more difficult to refine into lighter products such as gasoline. A refinery using less sophisticated processes will be constrained in its ability to optimize its mix of refined products when processing heavy oil.

==Futures trading==
For integrated [[List of petroleum companies|oil companies]] that control their entire [[supply chain]] from oil production to retail distribution of refined products, their business provides a natural economic hedge against adverse price movements. For independent oil refiners which purchase crude oil and sell refined products in the wholesale market, adverse price movements can present a significant economic risk. Given a target optimal product mix, an independent oil refiner can attempt to hedge itself against adverse price movements by buying oil [[futures contract|futures]] and selling futures for its primary refined products according to the proportions of its optimal mix.

For simplicity, most refiners wishing to hedge their price exposures have used a crack ratio usually expressed as '''X:Y:Z''' where '''X''' represents a number of barrels of crude oil, '''Y''' represents a number of barrels of gasoline and '''Z''' represents a number of barrels of distillate [[fuel oil]], subject to the constraint that '''X'''='''Y'''+'''Z'''. This crack ratio is used for hedging purposes by buying '''X''' barrels of crude oil and selling '''Y''' barrels of gasoline and '''Z''' barrels of distillate in the [[Futures exchange|futures market]]. The crack spread '''X:Y:Z''' reflects the spread obtained by trading oil, gasoline and distillate according to this ratio. Widely used crack spreads have included 3:2:1, 5:3:2 and 2:1:1.&lt;ref&gt;[http://home.comcast.net/~jjechura/CHEN409/01_Introduction.pdf Petroleum Refining Overview]&lt;/ref&gt; As the 3:2:1 crack spread is the most popular of these, widely quoted crack spread benchmarks are the "Gulf Coast 3:2:1" and the "Chicago 3:2:1".{{fact|date=June 2008}}

Various [[Financial intermediary|financial intermediaries]] in the [[commodity market]]s have tailored their products to facilitate trading crack spreads. For example, [[New York Mercantile Exchange|NYMEX]] offers virtual crack spread futures contracts by treating a basket of underlying NYMEX futures contracts corresponding to a crack spread as a single transaction.&lt;ref&gt;See [https://web.archive.org/web/20160804095220/partners.futuresource.com/marketcenter/pdfs/crack.pdf NYMEX Crack Spread Handbook] ([[Internet Archive|archived]])&lt;/ref&gt; Treating crack spread futures baskets as a single transaction has the advantage of reducing the margin requirements for a crack spread futures position. Other market participants dealing [[Over-the-counter (finance)|over the counter]] provide even more customized products.

The following discussion of crack spread contracts comes from the [[Energy Information Administration]] publication ''Derivatives and Risk Management in the Petroleum, Natural Gas, and Electricity Industries'':&lt;ref&gt;See subsection '''Crack Spread Contracts''' of chapter 3 [http://econometricainc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/EIA_Derivatives_Report.pdf "Managing Risk With Derivatives in the Petroleum and Natural Gas Industries"]&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Refiners’ profits are tied directly to the spread, or difference, between the price of crude oil and the prices of refined products. Because refiners can reliably predict their costs other than crude oil, the spread is their major uncertainty. One way in which a refiner could ensure a given spread would be to buy crude oil futures and sell product futures. Another would be to buy crude oil [[call option]]s and sell product [[call option]]s. Both of those strategies are complex, however, and they require the hedger to tie up funds in margin accounts.

To ease this burden, NYMEX in 1994 launched the crack spread contract. NYMEX treats crack spread purchases or sales of multiple futures as a single trade for the purposes of establishing margin requirements. The crack spread contract helps refiners to [[Vendor lock-in|lock-in]] a crude oil price and heating oil and unleaded gasoline prices simultaneously in order to establish a fixed refining margin. One type of crack spread contract bundles the purchase of three crude oil futures (30,000 barrels) with the sale a month later of two unleaded gasoline futures (20,000 barrels) and one heating oil future (10,000 barrels). The 3-2-1 ratio approximates the real-world ratio of refinery output—2 barrels of unleaded gasoline and 1 barrel of heating oil from 3 barrels of crude oil. Buyers and sellers concern themselves only with the margin requirements for the crack spread contract. They do not deal with individual margins for the underlying trades.

An average 3-2-1 ratio based on sweet crude is not appropriate for all refiners, however, and the OTC market provides contracts that better reflect the situation of individual refineries. Some refineries specialize in heavy crude oils, while others specialize in gasoline. One thing OTC traders can attempt is to aggregate individual refineries so that the trader’s portfolio is close to the exchange ratios. Traders can also devise swaps that are based on the differences between their clients’ situations and the exchange standards.

'''Critical opalescence''' is a phenomenon which arises in the region of a continuous, or second-order, [[phase transition]]. Originally reported by Charles Cagniard de la Tour in 1823 in mixtures of alcohol and water, its importance was recognised by [[Thomas Andrews (scientist)|Thomas Andrews]] in 1869 following his experiments on the liquid-gas transition in [[carbon dioxide]], many other examples have been discovered since. The phenomenon is most commonly demonstrated in binary fluid mixtures, such as [[methanol]] and [[cyclohexane]]. As the [[critical point (physics)|critical point]] is approached, the sizes of the gas and liquid region begin to fluctuate over increasingly large length scales (the [[correlation length]] of the liquid diverges). As the density fluctuations become of a size comparable to the wavelength of light, the [[Light scattering|light is scattered]] and causes the normally [[transparency (optics)|transparent]] liquid to appear cloudy. Tellingly, the [[opalescence]] does not diminish as one gets closer to the critical point, where the largest fluctuations can reach even centimetre proportions, confirming the physical relevance of smaller fluctuations.

In 1908 the Polish physicist [[Marian Smoluchowski]] became the first to ascribe the phenomenon of critical opalescence to large density fluctuations. In 1910 [[Albert Einstein]] showed that the link between critical opalescence and [[Rayleigh scattering]] is quantitative [http://einstein-annalen.mpiwg-berlin.mpg.de/home].

'''Cross-laminated timber (CLT)''' is a wood panel product made from gluing layers of solid-sawn lumber together. Each layer of boards is oriented perpendicular to adjacent layers and glued on the wide faces of each board, usually in a symmetric way so that the outer layers have the same orientation. An odd number of layers is most common, but there are configurations with even numbers as well (which are then arranged to give a symmetric configuration). Regular timber is an anisotropic material, meaning that the physical properties change depending on the direction at which the force is applied. By gluing layers of wood at perpendicular angles, the panel is able to achieve better structural rigidity in both directions. It is similar to [[plywood]] but with distinctively thicker laminations.

CLT is distinct to [[glued laminated timber]], a product with all laminations orientated in the same way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.structuraltimber.co.uk/timber-systems/glulamclt|title=Glulam/CLT Structural Timber Association|publisher=|accessdate=2 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
CLT was first developed and used in Germany and Austria in the early 1990's, but it was only after the mid 1990's more extensive research was completed. By the 2000's CLT saw much wider usage in Europe, being used in various building systems such as single-family and multi-story housing. As old growth timber become more difficult to source, CLT and other engineered wood products appeared on the market.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/820617275|title=CLT handbook: cross-laminated timber|last=Karacabeyli|first=Erol|last2=Douglas|first2=Brad|last3=Forest Products Laboratory (U.S.)|last4=FPInnovations (Institute)|last5=Binational Softwood Lumber Council|date=2013|publisher=FPInnovations|isbn=9780864885548|location=Pointe-Claire, Québec|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Building Code Requirements (United States) ==
In 2015, CLT was incorporated into the National Design Specification for wood construction. This specification was used as a reference for the 2015 [[International Building Code|International Building Code]], in turn allowing CLT to be recognized as a code compliant construction material. These code changes permitted CLT to be used in the assembly of exterior walls, floors, partition walls and roofs. Also included in the 2015 IBC were char rates for fire protection, connection provisions and fastener requirements specific to CLT. To meet structural performance requirements, the code mandated that structural CLT products met the requirements specified by ANSI/APA PRG 320.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.constructionspecifier.com/what-the-2015-international-building-code-means-for-wood-construction-part-i/|title=What the 2015 International Building Code means for wood construction: Part I - Construction Specifier|website=www.constructionspecifier.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Manufacturing ==
The manufacturing of CLT can be split up into nine steps, primary lumber selection, lumber grouping, lumber planing, lumber cutting, adhesive application, panel lay-up, assembly pressing, quality control and finally marketing and shipping.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;{{Rp|77–91}}

The primary lumber selection consists of two to three parts, moisture content check, visual grading and sometimes depending on the application structural testing. Depending on the results of this selection, the timber fit for CLT will be used to create either construction grade CLT or appearance grade CLT. Timber that cannot fit into either category may be used for different products such as plywood or glued laminated timber.

The grouping step ensures the timber of various categories are grouped together. For construction grade CLT, the timber that has better structural properties will be used in the interior layers of the CLT panel while the two outermost layers will be of higher aesthetic qualities. For aesthetic grade CLT, all layers will be of higher visual qualities.

The planing step improves the surfaces of the timber. The purpose of this is to improve the performance of the adhesive between layers. Approximately 2.5mm is trimmed off the top and bottom faces and 3.8mm is trimmed off the sides to ensure a flat surface.&lt;ref&gt;Julien, F. (2010) Manufacturing cross-laminated timber (CLT): Technological and economic analysis, report to Quebec Wood Export Bureau. 201001259-3257AAM. Quebec, QC: FPInnovations&lt;/ref&gt; There are some cases in which only the top and bottom faces are treated, this is typically the case if the sides do not have to be adhered to another substance. It is possible that this step may change the overall moisture content of the timber, however this is rarely happens.

The timber is then cut to a certain length depending on the application and specific client needs.

The adhesive is then applied to the timber, typically through a machine. It is important to note that application of the adhesive must be airtight to ensure there are no holes or air gaps in the glue and that the adhesive is applied at a constant rate.

A panel lay-up is performed to stick the individual timber layers together. According to section 8.3.1 of the performance standard ANSI/AP PRG 320, at least 80% of surface area between layers must be bound together.

Assembly pressing fully completes the adhering process. There are two main types of pressing methods, vacuum pressing and hydraulic pressing. In vacuum pressing more than one CLT panel can be pressed at one time making the process more time and energy efficient. Another advantage to vacuum pressing is that it can apply pressure to curved shaped CLT panels because of the way the pressure is distributed around the whole structure. As for hydraulic pressing, advantages include higher pressures can be achieved and also the pressures placed on each edge can be specified.&lt;ref&gt;Brandner, Reinhard. (2013). Production and Technology of Cross Laminated Timber (CLT): A state-of-the-art Report. Graz.&lt;/ref&gt;

Quality control is then performed on the CLT panels. Typically a sanding machine is used to create a better surface. The CLT panels are also cut to suit their specific design. Often, if the panels need to be conjoined to form longer structures [[finger joint]]s are used.

== Advantages ==
CLT has some advantages as a building material, including:
* Design flexibility - CLT has many applications. It can be used in walls, roofs or ceilings. The thickness of the panels can easily be increased by adding more layers and the length of the panels can be increased by joining panels together.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}
* Eco-Friendly - CLT is a renewable, green and sustainable material&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ramage|first=Michael H.|last2=Burridge|first2=Henry|last3=Busse-Wicher|first3=Marta|last4=Fereday|first4=George|last5=Reynolds|first5=Thomas|last6=Shah|first6=Darshil U.|last7=Wu|first7=Guanglu|last8=Yu|first8=Li|last9=Fleming|first9=Patrick|date=2017-02|title=The wood from the trees: The use of timber in construction|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rser.2016.09.107|journal=Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews|volume=68|pages=333–359|doi=10.1016/j.rser.2016.09.107|issn=1364-0321}}&lt;/ref&gt;, since it is made out of wood and does not require the burning of fossil fuels during production.
* Prefabrication - Floors or walls made from CLT can be fully manufactured before reaching the job site, which decreases lead times and could potentially lower overall construction costs.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}
* Thermal insulation - Being made out of multiple layers of wood, the thermal insulation of CLT can be high depending on the thickness of the panel.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}
*CLT is a relatively lighter building material - Foundations do not need to be as large and the machinery required on-site are smaller than those needed to lift heavier buildings materials&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;. These aspects also provide the additional capacity to erect CLT buildings on sites that might otherwise be incapable of supporting heavier projects, and eases [[Infill|infilling]] projects where construction is especially tight or difficult to access due to the preexisting buildings around the site&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lehmann|first=Steffen|last2=Lehmann|first2=Steffen|date=2012-10-18|title=Sustainable Construction for Urban Infill Development Using Engineered Massive Wood Panel Systems|url=https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/4/10/2707|journal=Sustainability|language=en|volume=4|issue=10|pages=2707–2742|doi=10.3390/su4102707}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Disadvantages  ==
CLT also has some disadvantages, including:

== Use ==

=== Pavilions ===
In September 2016 the world's first timber mega-tube structure was built at the [[Chelsea College of Arts]] in London, using hardwood CLT panels. The {{convert|115|ft}} long "Smile" was designed by architect [[Alison Brooks]] and engineered by Arup, in collaboration with the [[American Hardwood Export Council]], for the [[London Design Festival]]. The structure is a curved tube in a shape of a smile touching the floor at its centre. It has the maximum capacity of 60 people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.architectmagazine.com/technology/the-smile-by-alison-brooks-architects-gives-clt-a-boost_o|title=The Smile by Alison Brooks Architects Gives CLT a Boost|last1=Himelfarb|first1=Ellen|date=29 July 2016|work=Architect Magazine|accessdate=2 October 2016|publisher=[[American Institute of Architects]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== High rise buildings ===
Because of CLT's structural properties, the ability to be prefabricated and how light it is compared to other construction materials, CLT is starting to be used in many [[high-rise building]]s (see: [[Plyscraper]]). With its 4,649 cubic metres of CLT provided by UK based B&amp;K Structures, Dalston Lane at [[Dalston Square]] is one of the largest CLT projects globally. The project finished in early 2017. Considering the building was built on a [[Brownfield land|brownfield]], it was much taller than was thought to be feasible because of how light CLT is.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ramboll.com/projects/ruk/dalston-lane|title=Dalston Lane|accessdate=27 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.constructionnews.co.uk/companies/supply-chain/worlds-biggest-clt-structure-relies-on-collaboration/8692716.article|title=World's biggest CLT structure relies on collaboration|accessdate=20 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, [[Framework (building)|Framework]] in [[Portland, Oregon]] planned to utilize CLT for its 12-story structure, to become the tallest timber building in North America.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.digitaltrends.com/cool-tech/wood-skyscraper-approved-in-portland/|title=Tallest all-wood building in the U.S. approved for construction|date=2017-06-07|work=Digital Trends|access-date=2017-11-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; This structure was designed by LEVER Architecture, and may have had the first CLT post-tensioned rocking wall core as the lateral seismic system. This project was cancelled due to funding in 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.wweek.com/news/city/2018/07/16/plans-for-record-setting-timber-tower-in-downtown-portland-fall-through/|title=Plans for Record-Setting Timber Tower in Downtown Portland Fall Through|access-date=2018-07-16|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Australia, a nine-story all-timber office building is due to be completed in Brisbane in late 2018. Because of CLT’s ability to be prefabricated, construction was finished six weeks earlier than predicted. Due to CLT being lighter than traditional construction materials like concrete and steel, 20% more space was able to be reallocated from structural elements to functional space.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-06-22/all-timber-office-building-to-be-built-brisbane/8642424&lt;/ref&gt;

The current tallest CLT structure and the first hybrid structure more than 14 stories tall is [[UBC]]’s Brock Commons Residence hall. Completed in September 2017, the building is approximately 53 meters tall with 18 stories and houses approximately 400 students. The architect firm for this building was Acton Ostry Architects, while the structural engineering company was Fast + Epp. 17 out of the 18 stories use CLT as the floor panels and glue laminated timber as the columns, 70% of cladding used in the facade is made from wood. It is estimated that the carbon dioxide emissions were reduced by 2432 tonnes when compared to using concrete and steel. The approximate cost of the building was $51.5 million. This project targeted to achieve LEED gold upon its completion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://news.ubc.ca/2016/09/15/structure-of-ubcs-tall-wood-building-now-complete/|title=Structure of UBC’s tall wood building now complete|date=2016-09-15|work=UBC News|access-date=2017-11-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Bridges ===
CLT is also used in a number of bridge projects. The 160 meter long Mistissini Bridge is located in Québec, Canada and crosses Uupaachikus Pass. The designer for this bridge was [[Stantec]] and it was completed in 2014. Locally sourced CLT panels and glue laminated timber girders were used as the main structural members of the bridge.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.apawood.org/mistissini-bridge|title=Mistissini Bridge - APA – The Engineered Wood Association|website=www.apawood.org|language=en|access-date=2017-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; This project won numerous awards including the National Award of Excellence in the Transportation category at the 48th annual Association of Consulting Engineering Companies (ACEC) and also the Engineering a Better Canada Award.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/mistissini-wooden-bridge-wins-engineering-accolades-1.3830130|title=Mistissini's wooden bridge wins more engineering accolades|work=CBC News|access-date=2017-11-25|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Maicasagi Bridge is located in north of Québec and spans 68 meters. The bridge was completed in 2011 and uses CLT and glue laminated timber in combination to create two [[box girder]]s. This combination of timber was chosen because of the ability to be prefabricated allowing for a short lead time compared to a traditional steel bridge.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cecobois.com/en/projects/maicasagi-bridge|title=Cecobois|website=Cecobois|language=en-CA|access-date=2017-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Dongtan''' is a plan for a [[New town|new]] [[eco-city]] on the island of [[Chongming Island|Chongming]] in [[Shanghai]], [[People's Republic of China|China]].

==Population==
Dongtan was planned to open, with accommodation for 10,000, in time for the [[Expo 2010|Shanghai World Expo]] in 2010. By 2050 the city was expected to be one-third the size of [[Manhattan]], with a total planned population of 500,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wbcsd.org/Plugins/DocSearch/details.asp?DocTypeId=251&amp;ObjectId=MTk4MTk |author=Herbert Girardet |publisher=World Business Council for Sustainable Development |title=Dongtan - the world's first eco-city |date=31 July 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725131336/http://www.wbcsd.org/Plugins/DocSearch/details.asp?DocTypeId=251&amp;ObjectId=MTk4MTk |archivedate=25 July 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.newbuilder.co.uk/news/newsFullStory.asp?ID=1940 |title=Green Building: Eco City design to be reviewed in Birmingham |date=18 April 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070425125002/http://www.newbuilder.co.uk/news/NewsFullStory.asp?ID=1940 |archivedate=25 April 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/15.05/feat_popup.html |author=Douglas McGray |publisher=Wired Magazine |title=Pop-Up Cities: China Builds a Bright Green Metropolis |origyear= 24 April 2007 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100325182000/http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/15.05/feat_popup.html |date= 2008-05-15 |archivedate= 2010-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the project has fallen behind schedule, and no construction has taken place yet.

==Design==
[[Arup Group Limited|Arup]], the British engineering consultancy firm, was contracted in 2005 by the developer, The Shanghai Industrial Investment Company (SIIC), to design and masterplan Dongtan, an eco-city on Chongming Island close to Shanghai, the first of a planned series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://observer.guardian.co.uk/business/story/0,6903,1635188,00.html |publisher=The Guardian |title=British to help China build 'eco-cities' |date=6 November 2005 |location=London |first=Frank |last=Kane}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dongtan was presented at the United Nations World Urban Forum by China as an example of an eco-city, and is the first of up to four such cities to be designed and built in China by Arup. The cities are planned to be ecologically friendly, with zero-greenhouse-emission transit and complete self-sufficiency in water and energy, together with the use of [[zero energy building]] principles. Energy demand will be substantially lower than comparable conventional cities due to the high performance of buildings and a zero emission transport zone within the city. Waste is considered to be a resource and most of the city's waste will be recycled.

Dongtan proposes to have only [[green transport]] movements along its coastline. People will arrive at the coast and leave their cars behind, [[Gold Coast Oceanway#Seachange growth|travelling along the shore]] as pedestrians, cyclists or on sustainable [[public transport]] vehicles. The only vehicles allowed in the city will be powered by [[electric cars|electricity]] or [[hydrogen cars|hydrogen]]. Houses are now selling here to Shanghai middle classes for use when spending weekends away from the city. The Controlling authorities are now backtracking on these commitments and allowing private vehicles onto the site.

Arup is assisting in the coordination of these networks and in planning associated Institutes for Sustainability.

==Reaction==
The reaction to Dongtan has been mixed, although recent media coverage has largely been negative due to delays and shortcomings in the project's execution.

Former [[Mayor of London]] [[Ken Livingstone]] praised Dongtan as pioneering work leading to a more sustainable future.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arup.com/arup/newsitem.cfm?pageid=8295 Arup press release: "London looks to the East for inspiration to cut emissions"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070704033048/http://www.arup.com/arup/newsitem.cfm?pageid=8295 |date=July 4, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His sentiments were echoed by other prominent British politicians, including [[Gordon Brown]] and [[Tony Blair]], although none of them have ever visited the site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Malcolm Moore |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/china/3223985/Chinas-Dongtan-demise-is-mirrored-by-bad-news-for-Britains-eco-towns.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090204144304/http://telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/china/3223985/Chinas-Dongtan-demise-is-mirrored-by-bad-news-for-Britains-eco-towns.html |date=18 October 2008 |archivedate=2009-02-04 |publisher=The Telegraph |title=China's Dongtan demise is mirrored by bad news for Britain's eco-towns |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics have argued that Dongtan will not have a big impact on existing Chinese cities, which will still house the majority of the population.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chinadialogue.net/article/summary/297-Which-way-China- chinadialogue, 中国与世界，环境危机大家谈 - article about China and urban sustainability] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070108013007/http://www.chinadialogue.net/article/summary/297-Which-way-China- |date=January 8, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main designer, [[Thomas V. Harwood III]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Harwood|first=Thomas|title=Thomas V. Harwood Daily| issue= 3|volume= XVI|url=http://hackertyper.org|work=Thomas V. Harwood Daily|publisher=Thomas. V. Harwood Daily, Inc.|accessdate=29 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; is also taking part in many [[environmentally less friendly]] projects in China, including airports and office blocks. Arup recently received the "[[Greenwashing|Greenwasher]] of the Year Award" from Ethical Corporation Magazine for the most dubious green claim of the year, describing Dongtan as a [[Potemkin village]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ethicalcorp.com/content.asp?ContentID=5552 Ethical Corporation blog: Arup and Dongtan, worthy winner of Greenwasher of the year] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080117151434/http://www.ethicalcorp.com/content.asp?ContentID=5552 |date=January 17, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Philip Pullman|Philip Pullman's]] writings, '''Dust''' or  '''Rusakov Particles''' are elementary particles associated with consciousness that are integral to the plot.  Dust features in the multiverse written about in ''[[His Dark Materials]]'' and ''[[The Book of Dust]]''.  Because Dust is attracted to consciousness, especially after maturation, the Church within the series associates it with [[original sin]] and seeks its end.  Pullman described Dust in a 2017 interview as “an analogy of consciousness, and consciousness is this extraordinary property we have as human beings”.&lt;ref name="GdnDkean"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/feb/15/philip-pullman-unveils-epic-fantasy-trilogy-the-book-of-dust|title=Philip Pullman unveils epic fantasy trilogy The Book of Dust|last=Kean|first=Danuta|date=2017-02-14|accessdate=18 October 2017|publisher=The Guardian|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[Northern Lights (novel)|Northern Lights]]'', Lord Asriel reveals the origins of the term "Dust" to be from a passage from the slightly alternate version of the [[Bible]] in [[Locations in His Dark Materials#Lyra.27s world|Lyra's world]]: "In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, till thou return unto the ground; for out of it wast thou taken: for dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return"  ({{Bibleverse|Genesis|3:19|KJV}}).  Dust was previously known (in [[Lyra Belacqua]]'s universe) as 'Rusakov particles' named after their discoverer, Boris Mikhailovitch Rusakov.  Rusakov discovers a field permeating the universe enabling consciousness; before the discovery of Dust, its existence is predicted, as "''the existence of a Rusakov field implies the existence of a related particle''".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=La Belle Sauvage|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mary Malone]] researches [[dark matter]] in an alternate universe, referring to it as "Shadows".  This name was given to the particle by her colleague, Oliver Payne, in references to the [[Allegory of the Cave]],{{or|date=December 2017}} involving "Shadows on the wall".  When she is able to communicate with Shadows by interfacing with her detector, it confirms that they are the same as Dust and dark matter.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;"''Are you Shadows? YES.''

''Are you the same as Lyra's Dust? YES.''

''And is that dark matter? YES.''

''Dark matter is conscious? EVIDENTLY."''

''-The Subtle Knife''. Chapter 12.
&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Races and creatures in His Dark Materials#Mulefa|Mulefa]], who are able to see Dust directly, use the word "sraf" accompanied by a leftward flick of the trunk (or arm for humans) to describe it.

== Functions ==
{{Rquote
| text = Dust came into being when living things became conscious of themselves; but it needed some feedback system to reinforce it and make it safe, as the mulefa had their wheels and the oil from the trees. Without something like that, it would all vanish. Thought, imagination, feeling, would all wither and blow away, leaving nothing but a brutish automatism; and that brief period when life was conscious of itself would flicker out like a candle in every one of the billions of worlds where it had burned brightly.
| source = ''The Amber Spyglass'', Chapter 34

}}
Dust is attracted to objects that have been formed by consciousness, and by special photographic emulsions can be viewed. It is particularly attracted to consciousnesses that have matured; in the case of humans in Lyra's world, this happens when their [[Dæmon (His Dark Materials)|Dæmon]] is fixed in shape.  For the [[mulefa]], this happens when adolescents start using wheels. Dust is also what connects humans to their [[Dæmon (His Dark Materials)|dæmons]]. If the bond between a child and their dæmon is severed (as through [[Dæmon (His Dark Materials)#Separation|Intercision]]), both the child and the dæmon will eventually die. If the separation occurs after Dust has settled on the person (that is, after [[adolescence]]), the person becomes a lifeless shell.

In Pullman's trilogy, [[Races and creatures in His Dark Materials#Angels|Angels]] are formed when Dust condenses. It's noted that they only appear as winged humans because that's what is expected; in reality, they are much more complex shapes, more similar to "architecture".

Dust is able to communicate with humans via several methods shown throughout ''His Dark Materials'' and ''The Book of Dust'', including by use of alethiometers.  [[Mary Malone]] is able to construct a computer program that, when paired with a detector, can communicate with Dust by typed questions.  Later, Mary uses [[I Ching divination]], which Lyra confirms to be a method of communicating with Dust.&lt;ref&gt;"And there's a way they have in that country of talking to Dust, I mean Shadows, same as you got here and I got with the—I got with pictures, only their way uses sticks. I think it meant that picture on the door, but I didn't understand it, really. I thought when I first saw it there was something important about it, only I didn't know what. So there must be lots of ways of talking to Shadows."

''-The Subtle Knife'', Chapter 4.
&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Alethiometers ===
In Lyra's world, six alethiometers were constructed. Also known as symbol readers, alethiometers have a ring of 36 standard symbols, but differ in level of decoration.  Over the course of the books, several alethiometers are shown being read, including by [[Lyra Belacqua]], Hannah Relf, and Fra Pavel.

Each symbol on the rim of an alethiometer has indefinite levels of meaning; for example, the anchor can mean steadfastness, hope, or the sea.  To phrase a question, three adjustable arms are pointed towards symbols, and the reader has to hold the level of meaning for each symbol in their head.  A fourth arm, made of an alloy sensitive to Dust, swings around, stopping on different symbols to give an answer, with the number of times it stops at a given symbol indicating the level of meaning intended.

In ''[[La Belle Sauvage]]'', it's said that no more alethiometers can be built as their construction relies on a rare metal being subjected to special treatments, knowledge of which has been lost. Oxford has an alethiometer in its library, which is read by Hannah Relf, various other universities have one, and one is missing.  After the Magisterium attempts to steal one, a secret society opposed to their actions is able to obtain it and give it to Relf to use for them.  The missing alethiometer is found by Malcolm Polstead in the pack of Gerard Bonneville and given to the Master of Jordan College at the same time as Lyra is given, for safekeeping. 

In ''[[Northern Lights (novel)|Northern Lights]]'', this alethiometer is given by the Master to Lyra, who learns to read it by intuition, and it is said that there are only two others in existence.

== History within the books==

Dust came into existence when consciousness did, as it is created by consciousness as well as being itself conscious.  Dust condenses into Angels; the first of these was called [[List of His Dark Materials characters#The Authority|The Authority]], and told all future angels that he was the creator of the multiverse.

About 33,000 years ago, Dust induced changes in sapient species, including humans and [[mulefa]], to allow them to interact better, conferring more consciousness. For the mulefa, this was the start of their oral history and memory as a species.  When asked directly, Dust states that this was done by rebel angels for "vengeance"&lt;ref&gt;"''And did you intervene in human evolution?''

''YES.''

''Why?''

''VENGEANCE.''

''Vengeance for—oh! Rebel angels! After the war in Heaven—Satan and the Garden of Eden"''

''-The Subtle Knife'', Chapter 12
&lt;/ref&gt; over the war in heaven. 

300 years before the start of ''His Dark Materials'', scientists in [[Cittagazze]] created the [[The Subtle Knife|Subtle Knife]], which allowed them to travel between worlds.  However, Dust was lost in the cracks of these windows into the void between universes, and the mulefa noticed that their trees, which depend on Dust for fertilisation, started producing fewer seeds.

In Lyra's world, the Bible describes [[Original sin|the eating of the apple of knowledge]] in the [[Garden of Eden]] as causing Adam and Eve's [[Dæmon (His Dark Materials)|dæmons]] to settle into one shape. The discovery that Dust settles on humans after adolescence, when their dæmons settle, causes the Church to associate it with Original Sin and to demonise it. To that end, they begin a series of experiments on children involving the separation of dæmons.{{OR|date=October 2017}}

'''Elutriation ''' is a process for separating particles based on their size, shape and density, using a stream of [[gas]] or [[liquid]] flowing in a direction usually opposite to the direction of sedimentation. This method is mainly used for particles smaller than 1&amp;nbsp;μm. The smaller or lighter particles rise to the top (overflow) because their [[terminal velocity|terminal sedimentation velocities]] are lower than the velocity of the rising fluid. The terminal velocity of any particle in any medium can be calculated using [[Stokes' law]] if the particle's [[Reynolds number]] is below 0.2.  [[Counterflow centrifugation elutriation]] is a related technique to separate cells.

== Air classification ==
[[File:N.N.Zoubov Engineers Air Classifier Air Separator.png|thumb|alt=Air classifier|Air classifier]]
An air elutriator is a simple device which can separate particles into two or more groups.

Material may be separated by means of an elutriator, which consists of a vertical tube up which fluid is passed at a controlled velocity. When the particles are introduced, often through a side tube, the smaller particles are carried over in the fluid stream while the larger particles settle against the upward current. If one starts with low flow rates, small less dense particle attain their terminal velocities, and flow with the stream. The particle from the stream is collected in overflow and hence will be separated from the feed. Flow rates can be increased to separate higher size ranges.
Further size fractions may be collected if the overflow from the first tube is passed vertically upwards through a second tube of greater cross-section, and any number of such tubes can be arranged in series.

It is used in mineral processing for size classification.
The elutriation dust value is a usual measure for quantification of dust, generated by testing wherein mechanical forces such as vibration are applied to granules of e.g. a detergent agent.

Elutriation is a common method used by biologists to sample [[meiofauna]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://paperity.org/p/26446057/the-quantitative-separation-of-meiofauna|title=The quantitative separation of meiofauna|date=May 1973|journal=Helgoland Marine Research|author=G. Uhlig, H. Thiel, J. S. Gray}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The [[sediment]] sample is constantly agitated by a flow of filtered water from below, the action of which dislodges [[wikt:interstice#Noun|interstitial]] [[organism]]s embedded between sediment grains. A very fine filter at the top captures these organisms from the overflow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://paperity.org/p/79915277/micro-and-nanoplastic-pollution-of-freshwater-and-wastewater-treatment-systems|title=Micro- and Nanoplastic Pollution of Freshwater and Wastewater Treatment Systems|date=7 June 2017|journal=Springer Science Reviews|author= R.

'''Environmental studies''' is a multidisciplinary academic field which systematically studies [[human behavior|human interaction]] with the [[Natural environment|environment]] in the interests of solving complex problems. Environmental studies brings together the principles of the physical sciences, commerce/economics and social sciences so as to solve contemporary environmental problems. It is a broad field of study that includes the [[natural environment]], the [[built environment]], and the sets of relationships between them. The field encompasses study in basic principles of [[ecology]] and [[environmental science]], as well as associated subjects such as [[environmental ethics|ethics]], [[environmental geography|geography]], [[anthropology]], [[environmental policy|policy]], [[environmental politics|politics]], [[urban planning]], [[environmental law|law]], [[environmental economics|economics]], [[environmental philosophy|philosophy]], [[environmental sociology|sociology]] and [[environmental justice|social justice]], [[environmental planning|planning]], [[pollution control]] and [[natural resource management]].&lt;ref&gt;[[National Center for Education Statistics]].

Institute of Education Sciences, [[United States Department of Education]]. [Accessed 29 January 2010]&lt;/ref&gt; There are also many degree programs in Environmental Studies including the [[Master's degree|Master of Environmental Studies]] and the [[Bachelor's degree|Bachelor of Environmental Studies]].

==History==
The [[State University of New York College of Environmental Science and Forestry|New York State College of Forestry at Syracuse University]] established a BS in environmental studies degree in the 1950s, awarding its first degree in 1956.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.esf.edu/es/about.htm "About Environmental Studies at ESF,"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171201031236/http://www.esf.edu/es/about.htm |date=1 December 2017 }} SUNY-ESF website. Accessed 28 November 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Middlebury College]] established the major there in 1965.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.middlebury.edu/academics/es|title=Environmental Studies - Middlebury|author=|date=|website=middlebury.edu|accessdate=29 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171105051927/http://www.middlebury.edu/academics/es|archivedate=5 November 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Environmental Studies Association of Canada]] (ESAC) was established in 1993 "to further research and teaching activities in areas related to environmental studies in Canada".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.esac.ca/about/a-brief-history-of-esac/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-03-12 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120128074556/http://esac.ca/about/a-brief-history-of-esac/ |archivedate=28 January 2012 |df=dmy-all }} "A Brief History of ESAC". Accessed 12 March 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; ESAC's magazine, ''[[A\J: Alternatives Journal]]'' was first published by [[Robert A. Paehlke]] on 4 July 1971.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alternativesjournal.ca/magazines/summer-1971-11 ''Alternatives''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120106014646/http://www.alternativesjournal.ca/magazines/summer-1971-11 |date=6 January 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alternativesjournal.ca/the-alternatives-story "The Alternatives Story"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120106020749/http://www.alternativesjournal.ca/the-alternatives-story |date=6 January 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Association for Environmental Studies and Sciences]] (AESS) was founded in 2008 as the first professional association in the interdisciplinary field of environmental studies in the United States. In 2010, the National Council for Science and the Environment (NCSE) agreed to advise and support the Association. The Association's scholarly journal, the ''Journal of Environmental Studies and Sciences'' (JESS), commenced publication in March 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aess.info|title=Association for Environmental Studies &amp; Sciences AESSonline.org|author=|date=|website=AESSOnline.org|accessdate=29 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160310034932/http://aess.info/|archivedate=10 March 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The History and Development of AESS|url=https://aessonline.org/about-aess/history/|website=Association for Environmental Studies and Sciences|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161106060958/https://aessonline.org/about-aess/history/|archivedate=6 November 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, many high school students are able to take environmental science as a college-level course.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://apstudent.collegeboard.org/apcourse/ap-environmental-science|title=AP Environmental Science|publisher=''Collegeboard|accessdate=4 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over 500 colleges and universities in the United States offer environmental studies as a degree.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://bigfuture.collegeboard.org/majors/natural-resources-conservation-environmental-studies|title=Major: Environmental Studies|publisher=''Collegeboard''|accessdate=4 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''twelfth-generation [[Ford F-Series]]''' is a light-duty [[pickup truck]] produced by [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] from the 2009 to 2014 model years. On the outside, the design was restricted to evolutionary styling upgrades, with a larger grille and headlights bringing it in line with the styling of the [[Ford Super Duty|Super Duty]] trucks; as with many other Ford vehicles of the time, the interior saw the introduction of higher-quality materials in all but the most basic trim levels.

Outside of Mexico, the [[Lincoln Mark LT]] was discontinued, replaced by the ''Platinum'' trim of the F-150.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://info.detnews.com/video/index.cfm?id=1756 |title=DETNEWS &amp;#124; WebVideo &amp;#124; 2009 Ford F-150 Platinum |publisher=Info.detnews.com |date=2008-01-13 |accessdate=2009-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this trim line is still sold as the '''Lincoln Mark LT''' in Mexico. For the 2010 model year, the SVT Raptor high-performance truck was introduced; unlike its Lightning predecessor, it was a vehicle dedicated to off-road driving.

In North America, the twelfth-generation F-150 was produced at the [[Ford River Rouge Complex|Dearborn Truck]] plant in [[Dearborn, Michigan]], as well as the [[Ford Kansas City Assembly Plant|Kansas City Assembly]] plant in [[Claycomo, Missouri]]. In December 2014, it was replaced by the thirteenth-generation 2015 F-150, unveiled in January 2014.

==Design history==
Ford revealed the 2009 [[Ford F-150|F-150]] design at the [[North American International Auto Show#2008|2008 North American International Auto Show]] in [[Detroit]]. Development began under chief engineer Matt O'Leary in November 2003 under the code name "P-415", after P-221 production began in June 2003.&lt;ref&gt;http://br.linkedin.com/pub/matt-o-leary/12/abb/188&lt;/ref&gt; General design work was done under Patrick Schiavone into late 2005, with further exterior changes taking place during late 2006 to the tailgate design and wheel lip arches during a development hiatus. The final design freeze later took place in early 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://media.freep.com/f150/index.html|title=Freep.com exclusive report: The new F-150 fights to keep its crown|website=media.freep.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Production of the series began in August 2008 at Ford's [[Ford Kansas City Assembly Plant|Kansas City Assembly Plant]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://media.ford.com/article_display.cfm?article_id=29165 |title=Ford's Kansas City Assembly Plant employees celebrate production of NEW 2009 Ford F-150 |work=Media.Ford.com |date=October 2, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ford originally planned to expand the F-Series platform by reintroducing the F-100 as a midsize truck. Known internally as P525, the F-100 would have served as the global replacement for [[Ford Ranger (North America)|Ford Ranger]] in 2010 or 2011,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.autoblog.com/2008/06/02/ford-planning-f100-and-global-ranger-replacement/ |title=Ford planning F-100 and global Ranger replacement |author=Neff, John |date=June 2, 2008 |work=Autoblog |accessdate=2009-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project was ultimately shelved, with the company developing the [[Ford Ranger (T6)|Ranger T6]] as a global midsize truck and in North America, Ford focused on developing fuel-efficient powertrains such as the EcoBoost V6 and the 6-speed automatic transmission for the F-150.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blogs.edmunds.com/straightline/2008/08/ford-tables-plans-for-f-100-pickup.html |title=Ford tables plans for F-100 pickup|author=Holland, Bob |date=August 8, 2008 |work=Edmunds Inside Line |accessdate=2009-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2009 F-150 featured a larger and more flexible interior, an updated three-bar grille, and additional choices of trim levels. The chassis included lighter-weight, high-strength steel for better fuel economy and safety and improved payload and towing capacity.  For the first time in the history of the F-Series, a V8 engine was standard in all models; no 6-cylinder was available. Regular cab models were once again produced with standard-length doors rather than two short, rear-opening doors. All Flareside models in 2009 were made with new badging on the [[Ford F-Series eleventh generation|previous generation's]] boxes and were discontinued at the end of the model year when stock had run out, echoing a similar situation in the first year of the [[Ford F-Series eighth generation|eighth generation]].

In 2009, the SVT Raptor off-road truck was introduced. Initially available as a Supercab with a unique 5.5-foot box, it was available with either a 320 hp 5.4L V8 or an optional 411 hp 6.2L V8 from the Super Duty line. The standard wheel of FX4 models was enlarged to 18".

2011 marked a major upgrade to the powertrain lineup. In the interest of increasing fuel economy, both versions of the 4.6L V8 and the 5.4L V8 were discontinued. In their place were a 3.7L V6 and a 5.0L V8. Between the two engines was an all-new 3.5L twin-turbocharged V6. Dubbed ''[[Ford Ecoboost engine|EcoBoost]]'', the 3.5L V6 produced 365&amp;nbsp;hp.

For 2012, the F-150 sported a ten-grade lineup (XL, STX, XLT, FX2, FX4, Lariat, King Ranch, Platinum, Harley-Davidson and SVT Raptor).

For 2013, the F-150 received minor changes such as 3 new grilles (replacing all 4 previous grilles), new optional 18-, 20-, or 22-inch wheels, [[Ford Sync|Sync]] with MyFord, [[MyFord Touch]] navigation system, new power-folding and telescoping trailer tow mirrors (taken from the [[Ford Super Duty|Super Duty]] models), [[high-intensity discharge]] headlamps, 3 new color options (Blue Jeans Metallic, Kodiak Brown Metallic and Ruby Red Clearcoat Metallic), new Alcantara seats in the FX Appearance Package, black or pecan leather in Platinum, the return of the Limited model and the 6.2-liter V8 being made available in XLT, FX2, and FX4 (SuperCab and SuperCrew only).

For 2014, a special truck called the Tremor was introduced, essentially an EcoBoost-equipped FX2 or FX4 truck in a regular cab model with a 6.5' bed, a special FX Appearance Package, a flow-through center console with bucket seats and a 4.10 rear gear final drive ratio.

Also new in 2014, the STX trim level also became available on SuperCrew models with the 5.5' box. In addition an STX Sport package was added for 2014 including 20" wheels, black cloth seats, and black exterior accents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.autoblog.com/2013/08/29/ford-f150-stx-supercrew-sport-package |title=Entry-level F-150 now offers SuperCrew, Sport Package|author=Brandon Turkus |date=Aug 29, 2013 |work=Autoblog |accessdate=2014-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Powertrain==
Three engines were offered with the 2009 redesign: a revised 5.4&amp;nbsp;L 3-valve Triton V8 that is [[E85]] capable with an output rating of {{convert|320|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|395|lbft|N.m|abbr=on}} of torque, a {{convert|292|hp|kW|abbr=on}} 4.6&amp;nbsp;L 3-valve V8, and a {{convert|248|hp|kW|abbr=on}} 4.6&amp;nbsp;L 2-valve [[V8 engine|V8]]. The 3-valve 5.4 and 4.6 liter V8s were mated to Ford's new 6R80E 6-speed automatic transmission while the 4R75E 4-speed [[automatic transmission]] was carried over for the 2-valve 4.6&amp;nbsp;L V8. The 4.2&amp;nbsp;L OHV [[V6 engine]], which had been available, was dropped due to the closure of the Essex engine plant where it was produced.

For the 2011 model year, an all-new engine lineup was offered. Two of the engines, a 3.7&amp;nbsp;L V6 and a 5.0&amp;nbsp;L V8, both based on the 2011 [[Ford Mustang (fifth generation)|Ford Mustang]] engines, both offer E85 flex-fuel capability. The 6.2&amp;nbsp;L V8 used in the 2011 [[Ford Super Duty]] was made available with the F-150 Platinum, Lariat, SVT Raptor, and Harley Davidson editions. Finally, the 3.5&amp;nbsp;L [[Gasoline direct injection|direct-injected]] [[twin-turbo]] [[EcoBoost]] V6 was offered in the F-150 starting in early 2011. All engines were paired with a new six-speed automatic transmission (6R80).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://media.ford.com/article_display.cfm?article_id=33096 |title=ALL-NEW FORD F-150 POWERTRAIN LINEUP DELIVERS TOP FUEL ECONOMY, BEST POWER AND CAPABILITY &amp;#124; Ford Motor Company Newsroom |publisher=Media.ford.com |date=2010-09-20 |accessdate=2010-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Electric power-assisted steering was made available on all engines besides the 6.2. Since 2008, the Ford F-150 has towing and hauling capacity of 11,300&amp;nbsp;lbs and 3,060&amp;nbsp;lbs, respectively.

== Safety ==

The 2009 Ford F-150 featured front-seat side impact airbags and Ford's Safety Canopy System for the first and second rows as head protection in the event of a side impact. It also featured Ford's exclusive ADVANCETRAC RSC (Roll Stability Control)--an electronic Stability control and anti-rollover safety feature also available in other Ford vehicles, from the Fusion to the Expedition.

The F-150 comes standard with AdvanceTrac [[Electronic Stability Control]], front and rear row side curtain airbags, and front row torso side airbags.

Safety Ratings can be found here (https://www.nhtsa.gov/ratings).

== Concepts ==
At the 2008 [[SEMA]] show, four 2009 Ford F-150s were unveiled: the F-150 Heavy Duty DEWALT Contractor, the FX-4 by X-Treme Toyz, the F-150 by Street Scene Equipment, and the Hi-Pa Drive F-150. The Heavy Duty DEWALT Contractor was built in a [[DeWalt]] theme. The FX-4, also called Fahrenheit F-150, was built for outdoor lifestyle enthusiasts. The Street Scene Equipment version is a lowered truck built with performance and style. The Hi-Pa Drive F-150 was powered by 4 electric in-wheel motors rated over {{convert|480|hp|abbr=on}} and over {{convert|375|ft.lbf|N.m|abbr=on}} torque combined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.autoblog.com/2008/10/30/sema-preview-ford-bringing-four-f-150s-to-sin-city/ |title=SEMA Preview: Ford bringing four F-150s to Sin City |date=October 30, 2008 |author=Lavrinc, Damon |work=Autoblog |accessdate=2009-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The SVT Raptor entered showrooms in late 2009,as a dedicated off-roader, with sales being much better than expected. It was powered by a 5.4&amp;nbsp;L (330&amp;nbsp;CID) V8 engine, with the option of a 6.2&amp;nbsp;L V8. The 5.4 &amp;nbsp;L (330&amp;nbsp;CID) engine has {{convert|310|hp||0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|365|ft.lbf|N.m|abbr=on}} of torque.

A six-speed automatic came standard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,548721,00.html | work=Fox News |title=2010 Ford F-150 SVT Raptor | date=2009-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Raptor features [[Fox Racing Shox|Fox Racing]] internal bypass shocks with external reservoirs which allows for 11" of suspension travel in front, and 12" in the rear. It comes standard with 35" [[BFGoodrich]] All Terrain tires, and a rear [[Locking differential]] with a 4.10:1 gear ratio.

[[File:Raptor 2011.jpg|thumb|2010 SVT Raptor]]

For 2011, the SVT Raptor was only offered with a 6.2&amp;nbsp;L V8. Other notable changes to the 2011 model include availability in a 4-door Super Crew cab and a 5th color option of Ingot Silver Metallic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Abuelsamid |first=Sam |url=http://www.autoblog.com/2010/08/12/2011-ford-f-150-svt-raptor-to-drop-base-engine-get-standard-6-2l-v8/ |title=2011 Ford F150 SVT Raptor drops base engine, gets standard 6.2L V8 — Autoblog |publisher=Autoblog.com |date=2010-08-12 |accessdate=2011-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

2012 Raptors eliminated the open [[Differential (mechanical device)|differential]] in the front end in favor of a Torsen [[Limited slip differential#Torque-sensitive|helical gear limited slip differential]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.fourwheeler.com/6748178/whats-new/f-150-svt-raptor-gets-a-torsen-front-diff-for-2012/index.html |title=F-150 SVT Raptor Gets A Torsen Front Diff For 2012 &amp;#124; What's New Blog &amp; Opinions at Four Wheeler Magazine |publisher=Blogs.fourwheeler.com |date=2011-10-01|accessdate=2011-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Carroll Shelby International|Shelby American]] makes a higher performance version of the SVT Raptor, called the Shelby Raptor. And, the [[Hennessey Performance Engineering#Hennessey Special Vehicles|Hennessey Special Vehicles]] division of Hennessey Performance Engineering makes an SUV version of the SVT Raptor, called the [[Hennessey Performance Engineering#VelociRaptor SUV|Hennessey VelociRaptor SUV]].

===Body, frame, and features===
From the A-pillar forward, the Raptor has a composite hood and fenders that are unique from other [[F-150]]s and bereft of the blue oval badge in the grille. SVT widened the track by {{convert|7|in||0|abbr=on}}, so its {{convert|5.5|ft|adj=on}} box is unique to the Raptor, as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thetruthaboutcars.com/2009/11/review-ford-svt-raptor/ |title=Review: Ford SVT Raptor |publisher=The Truth About Cars |date=|accessdate=2011-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Raptor's height is {{convert|2|in||0|abbr=on}} over a standard 4-wheel drive Supercrew. It also features new, internal bypass shocks, designed by [[Fox Racing Shox]].{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

The Raptor has new leaf springs and shocks, new front upper- and lower-A-arms, and a wider, thicker-walled rear axle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://gearheads.org/2017-ford-raptor-ecobeast/|title=2017 Ford Raptor EcoBeast - Gear Heads|date=2015-01-12|website=Gearheads|language=en-US|access-date=2016-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the first Ford with hill-descent control and comes with an electronic differential locker that lets the driver keep it locked at high speeds when the Raptor's Off Road Mode is engaged. Off Road Mode is a feature unique to the Raptor which allows more controlled, aggressive driving while in situations where increased traction and braking are necessary. The Raptor's Off Road Mode allows ABS, AdvanceTrac RSC (roll stability control), and traction control to be completely switched off giving the driver total control over the driving experience.{{clarify|date=November 2016}} Off Road Mode also changes the Raptor's throttle sensitivity and transmission shift points causing a more linear power and torque  curve for low traction situations.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

Ford originally promised a value price and a multi-year run—final pricing came in at US$42,000.00 for 2010.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

==Chinese copy controversy==
[[Image:Kawei Auto K1 01 Auto China 2014-04-23.jpg|thumb|Kawei K1.]]
In 2014, Chinese company [[Jiangsu Kawei Automotive]] released the [[Kawei K1]], which appeared to be nearly identical to the Ford F-150.&lt;ref name="foxnews.com"&gt;http://www.foxnews.com/leisure/2014/04/23/chinese-automaker-blatantly-copies-ford-f-150/&lt;/ref&gt;

When interviewed by Fox News in 2014, a Ford spokesman said they were aware of the Kawei and their legal counsel was investigating how best to address the matter.&lt;ref name="foxnews.com"/&gt;

''' Global storm activity of 2007''' profiles the major worldwide storms, including blizzards, ice storms, and other winter events, from January 1, 2007, to December 31, 2007. [[Winter storm]]s are events in which the dominant varieties of [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] are forms that only occur at cold temperatures, such as snow or [[Rain and snow mixed|sleet]], or a rainstorm where ground temperatures are cold enough to allow [[ice]] to form (i.e. [[freezing rain]]). It may be marked by strong wind, [[thunder]] and [[lightning]] (a [[thunderstorm]]), heavy [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]], such as ice ([[winter storm|ice storm]]), or wind transporting some substance through the [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]] (as in a [[dust storm]], [[snowstorm]], [[hail]]storm, etc.). Other major non winter events such as large dust storms, [[Hurricane]]s, [[cyclone]]s, [[tornado]]s, [[gale]]s, [[flooding]] and [[rainstorm]]s are also caused by such phenomena to a lesser or greater existent.

Very rarely, they may form in summer, though it would have to be an abnormally cold summer, such as the summer of [[Year Without a Summer|1816]] in the Northeast United States of America. In many locations in the Northern Hemisphere, the most powerful winter storms usually occur in March and, in regions where temperatures are cold enough, April.

==The events of 2007==

===January===

====January 9–12====
{{Main article|Saskatchewan blizzard of 2007}}
A low pressure brought up heavy snow and [[blizzard]] conditions across the Canadian Prairies. Snowfall locally reached between 8&amp;nbsp;inches (20&amp;nbsp;cm) to 1&amp;nbsp;foot (30&amp;nbsp;cm) in parts of [[Alberta]], [[Saskatchewan]] and [[Manitoba]]. Particularly hard-hit was central Saskatchewan, including the city of [[Saskatoon]]. The storm was accompanied by strong gusty winds in excess of 40&amp;nbsp;mph (64&amp;nbsp;km/h). Two people were killed during the blizzard when their car was stuck near a [[First Nations]] reserve in Saskatchewan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/saskatchewan/story/2007/01/10/fatals.html |work=CBC News |title=2 Die In Storm After Vehicle Gets Stuck |date=January 10, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080117190941/http://www.cbc.ca/canada/saskatchewan/story/2007/01/10/fatals.html |archivedate=January 17, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Saskatoon's [[Diefenbaker Airport]] as well as schools were closed.

Prior of hitting the Prairies, the system brought another windstorm to western [[British Columbia]], with gusts exceeding 60&amp;nbsp;mph (100&amp;nbsp;km/h). Additional trees at [[Stanley Park]] in Vancouver were uprooted. It also hindered efforts from workers who were trying to repair the inflatable roof of [[BC Place Stadium]] (home to the [[Canadian Football League]]'s [[BC Lions]]), which was damaged by winds from a previous storm a few days earlier. A secondary wave following the main storm dumped over 4&amp;nbsp;inches of snow (10&amp;nbsp;cm) in the [[Victoria, British Columbia|Victoria]], [[Vancouver]], and [[Seattle]] areas with heavier snow in the mountains. Over 115,000 homes were without power during the storm in B.C.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/saskatchewan/story/2007/01/10/sask-storm.html |work=CBC News |title=Worst blizzard in years blasts Saskatchewan |date=January 10, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090322022502/http://www.cbc.ca/canada/saskatchewan/story/2007/01/10/sask-storm.html |archivedate=March 22, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/edmonton/story/2007/01/10/weather-alberta.html |work=CBC News |title=Storm sweeps through central, eastern Alberta |date=January 10, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080420094904/http://www.cbc.ca/canada/edmonton/story/2007/01/10/weather-alberta.html |archivedate=April 20, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/british-columbia/story/2007/01/10/bc-roof.html |work=CBC News |title=Vancouver stadium roof repair dependent on better weather |date=January 10, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080117190839/http://www.cbc.ca/canada/british-columbia/story/2007/01/10/bc-roof.html |archivedate=January 17, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/british-columbia/story/2007/01/10/bc-storm.html |work=CBC News |title=B.C. struggling in wake of latest winter storm |date=January 10, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080604134613/http://www.cbc.ca/canada/british-columbia/story/2007/01/10/bc-storm.html |archivedate=June 4, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The storm would later drop some locally heavy amount of snows in parts of northern [[Ontario]] and central [[Quebec]] with 8&amp;nbsp;inches (20&amp;nbsp;cm) reported in [[Saguenay, Quebec|Saguenay]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.weatheroffice.ec.gc.ca/warnings/SWS_bulletins_e.html?prov=qc |title=Quebec – Special Weather Statements – Environment Canada |publisher=Weatheroffice.ec.gc.ca |date=December 22, 2011 |accessdate=January 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A cold front sharply drop temperatures from west to east with some areas getting their coldest days of the season across the Canadian and U.S. plains. The cold air later reached the eastern half of the continent at the end of the week.

====January 12–24====
{{Main article|January 2007 North American Ice Storm}}

Following a prolonged period of mild weather, a series of winter storms produced several waves of damaging freezing rain across the Midwest of the United States and central Canada from the 12th to the 16th causing the deaths of 85&amp;nbsp;people as of January 20. Several thousands of customers from Texas to [[New England]] lost power, some for several days. Some areas received as much as 4&amp;nbsp;inches of ice (100&amp;nbsp;mm).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.srh.noaa.gov/oun/enhanced.php?map=3 |title=NWS Norman, Oklahoma – Enhanced Weather Page |publisher=Srh.noaa.gov |date=August 22, 2011 |accessdate=January 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crh.noaa.gov/lsx/?n=jan2007ice |title=January 2007 Ice Storm |publisher=Crh.noaa.gov |date=September 23, 2010 |accessdate=January 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.crh.noaa.gov/crnews/display_story.php?wfo=sgf&amp;storyid=5295&amp;source=0&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Oklahoma]] and [[Missouri]] were declared disaster areas as they were the most hard hit states from the storms. Areas from [[Utah]] to [[New Brunswick]] received heavy amounts of snow from the 13th to the 16th. The storm was followed by an intense period of cold across most of the continent from California to [[Newfoundland and Labrador]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2007/US/01/14/oklahoma.crash.ap/index.html |work=CNN |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070129094014/http://www.cnn.com/2007/US/01/14/oklahoma.crash.ap/index.html |archivedate=January 29, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://www.cbc.ca/world/story/2007/01/14/ice-storm.html | work=CBC News | title=Ice storms blamed for 19 deaths in U.S. | date=January 15, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2007/WEATHER/01/16/winter.blast.ap/index.html |work=CNN |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070119054443/http://www.cnn.com/2007/WEATHER/01/16/winter.blast.ap/index.html |archivedate=January 19, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additional waves of precipitation have affected the south half of the United States from the 16th to 18th from Texas to [[North Carolina]], while another winter storm, called a [[weather bomb]] affected portions of New Brunswick, Quebec and [[Maine]] on the 19th and 20th with near blizzard conditions.

Another winter storm affected the central and southern Plains from the 19th to the 21st bringing snow and ice for most of the area with accumulations that topped off at about 4 to 10&amp;nbsp;inches of snow (10–25&amp;nbsp;cm). It also brought a light wintry mix across the [[Ohio Valley]] and the mid-Atlantic states on the 21st with little accumulation. [[Newfoundland and Labrador]] was the last region affected by the series of storms on the 23rd and 24th.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wwwa.accuweather.com/news-top-headline.asp?partner=accuweather&amp;traveler=0 |title=AccuWeather.com – Weather Blogs – Weather News |publisher=.accuweather.com |accessdate=January 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A major [[European windstorm]] gave heavy amounts of snow across portions of [[Scotland]]. Most areas of western Europe from Great Britain to the [[Czech Republic]] have experienced damaging winds. Wind gusts have reached 90&amp;nbsp;mph (150&amp;nbsp;km/h) in the plain and up to 140&amp;nbsp;mph (225&amp;nbsp;km/h) in the mountain area. Boat, rail and air traffic have been heavily affected, while several hundreds of flights from London, Berlin, [[Amsterdam]], Vienna, [[Prague]] and Paris have been delayed or canceled. U.S. Secretary of State [[Condoleezza Rice]] shortened her European trip due to the strong winds. Millions of residents were without power including 1&amp;nbsp;million in the [[Czech Republic]].

A snowstorm affected a large area of western and central Europe, including France, Great Britain, Austria and Germany bringing locally heavy snow accumulations and ice which disrupted air and train travel in Berlin, [[Stuttgart]] and London.  Some areas in the [[Alps]] region received as much as 1&amp;nbsp;meter of snow (40&amp;nbsp;inches). Three people were killed in Germany due to accidents caused by the storm. Over 5,000 motorists were stranded in a highway in eastern France due to the heavy snow amounts.

====February 1–12====
A major [[lake effect snow]] event, titled [[Lake Storm "Locust"]], occurred across the [[Great Lakes]] regions for several days. Areas most affected by the localized heavy burst of snows were just east of [[Georgian Bay]] area near [[Parry Sound, Ontario|Parry Sound]], east of [[Lake Huron]] near [[Wiarton, Ontario|Wiarton]], in western [[Michigan]], and in north central New York.

Areas near [[Oswego, New York|Oswego]] and northeast of [[Syracuse, New York|Syracuse]] received as much as 141&amp;nbsp;inches (358&amp;nbsp;cm) of snow during that period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.erh.noaa.gov/buf/locust/ |title=NWS Press Conference |publisher=Erh.noaa.gov |accessdate=January 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were unofficial reports that two towns on the [[Tug Hill Plateau]] southeast of [[Lake Ontario]] received over 10&amp;nbsp;feet (305&amp;nbsp;cm) of snow – [[Redfield, New York|Redfield]], with 141&amp;nbsp;inches (358&amp;nbsp;cm) and [[Parish (town), New York|Parish]], with 121&amp;nbsp;inches (307&amp;nbsp;cm). Local accumulations elsewhere on the plateau were well over 1&amp;nbsp;meter (3.3&amp;nbsp;ft). A [[state of emergency]] was declared in [[Oswego County, New York|Oswego County]] due to the intense snow. Portions of central Ontario received 1–3&amp;nbsp;feet (30–90&amp;nbsp;cm) of snow over the period while heavy accumulations were also reported in western [[Michigan]] just off the shores of [[Lake Michigan]].

On February 1, a snow squall just east of [[Oshawa]], Ontario on the north shore of Lake Ontario caused a 15-vehicle pileup including a tractor trailer which burst into flames. Two people were killed in the event. There were no reported deaths related to the event in New York State. However, 20 were killed in other states due to cold weather.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/cp/national/070201/n0201147A.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120723071544/http://www.cbc.ca/cp/national/070201/n0201147A.html |archive-date=July 23, 2012 |deadurl=yes |df= }} &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wwwa.accuweather.com/regional-news-story.asp?region=eastusnews |title=AccuWeather.com – Weather Blogs – Weather News |publisher=.accuweather.com |accessdate=January 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2007/WEATHER/02/07/cold.weather.ap/index.html |work=CNN |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070216194814/http://www.cnn.com/2007/WEATHER/02/07/cold.weather.ap/index.html |archivedate=February 16, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2007/WEATHER/02/10/cold.weather.ap/index.html |work=CNN |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070219215523/http://www.cnn.com/2007/WEATHER/02/10/cold.weather.ap/index.html |archivedate=February 19, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The event was very localized; areas outside the narrow bands received little or no snow.

====February 7–9====
A winter storm blanketed parts of the United Kingdom including the City of London disrupting travel all across the city including numerous flights cancelled from all airports and several motorists were stranding on area roads. Service on the [[London Underground|Underground]] subway system was also affected with several stations been closed. Many schools were also closed for one or two days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/london/content/articles/2007/02/07/snow_feature_feb07.shtml |title=BBC – London – In Pictures – Snow in London |publisher=BBC |accessdate=January 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The heavy snowfall started life as a low-pressure system sitting out in the Atlantic Ocean, at the time the UK was under the influence of a cold northerly wind. The low pressure system tracked towards the UK on the evening of February 7 and turned readily to snow as it hit the cold air. The snow turned back to rain across southern and western regions, but much of Wales, the Midlands and the south-east had significant snowfalls on the 8th. The West Midlands in particular was badly hit, with up to 6&amp;nbsp;inches (15&amp;nbsp;cm) reported over high ground – the most snow to fall in this region for 15 years. In [[Wales]], [[Sennybridge, United Kingdom|Sennybridge]] in [[Powys]], reported 15&amp;nbsp;inches (38&amp;nbsp;cm) on level snow with drifts of up to 3&amp;nbsp;feet (90&amp;nbsp;cm) in places.  On the 9th, the low pressure over France tracked further north than forecast, bringing more heavy snow for the [[English Midlands|Midlands]] and Wales. This caused additional travel disruption as the roads were not gritted and heavy gridlock formed on many of the roads. The snow began to thaw over the weekend and in turn caused some localised flooding.

Late on the 23rd, it moved onto the central [[High Plains (United States)|High Plains]] and organized into a major storm that spread snow from eastern [[Colorado]] northeast into the [[Upper Midwest]] and [[Great Lakes]] region, and ice from Iowa to northern Indiana. The system then split into two with the northern branch dissipating due to a blocking ridge of high pressure which prevented the blizzard from moving north into Canada. The storm continued into the Mid-Atlantic on the 25th, dropping snow as far south as the Washington, D.C. area.

Snowfall amounts from 12 to 24&amp;nbsp;inches (30–60&amp;nbsp;cm)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.crh.noaa.gov/crnews/display_story.php?wfo=mpx&amp;storyid=6208&amp;source=0&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.crh.noaa.gov/crnews/display_story.php?wfo=mqt&amp;storyid=6258&amp;source=0&lt;/ref&gt; were common in [[Minnesota]], [[Iowa]], [[Wisconsin]], and [[Illinois]], while lighter amounts were reported in [[Michigan]] and [[Ontario]].

Another major storm moved into the [[Pacific Northwest]] coast on the 27th, adding to the several feet of snow already recorded in the [[Cascade Range|Cascades]] and [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]] in the previous few days. It impacted the [[Upper Midwest]], the northern Plains, the [[Great Lakes]] and [[Quebec]] regions with heavy snow, sleet, freezing rain and high winds by March 1 and 2, in addition to bringing more severe thunderstorms to the South. Already, numerous tornadoes were reported in [[Alabama]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], [[Missouri]] and [[Kansas]] including six killers. A deadly tornado struck [[Enterprise High School (Alabama)|Enterprise High School]], killing 8 students on
March 1. On March 2, over 2&amp;nbsp;inches of rain fell in New York City and snow, sleet and freezing rain fell in the interior Northeast.

[[Omaha, Nebraska]] was under a blizzard warning for the first time in 9 years, with much of the city receiving a foot (30.5&amp;nbsp;cm) or more of snow, and thunder snow as reported at the beginning of the storm. Wind speeds in Omaha were clocked as high as 58&amp;nbsp;miles per hour, creating snow drifts in outlying areas up to 8 feet depth.  The entire state of Iowa was placed under a [[State of Emergency]] by Governor [[Chet Culver]] while large stretches of [[Interstate 80]] were shut down.  The [[National Guard of the United States|National Guard]] came into the area to bring generators to restore power until utility lines were repaired.

Several areas in Manitoba as well as the [[Northern Plains]] received over 8&amp;nbsp;inches (20&amp;nbsp;cm) of snow with portions of Wisconsin receiving 16&amp;nbsp;inches (40&amp;nbsp;cm), 17&amp;nbsp;inches (42&amp;nbsp;cm) for parts of [[Iowa]], 12–25&amp;nbsp;inches (30–63&amp;nbsp;cm) in parts of Minnesota with the highest accumulations falling in the northwest suburbs of the twin cities metropolitan region, (Anoka, Champlin, Maple Grove, Plymouth, Rogers).,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.crh.noaa.gov/crnews/display_story.php?wfo=mpx&amp;storyid=6411&amp;source=0&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.crh.noaa.gov/crnews/display_story.php?wfo=dlh&amp;storyid=4834&amp;source=0&lt;/ref&gt; and up to 21&amp;nbsp;inches (53&amp;nbsp;cm) across the [[Dakotas]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.crh.noaa.gov/crnews/display_story.php?wfo=fgf&amp;storyid=6407&amp;source=0&lt;/ref&gt; Portions of Ontario and Quebec from [[Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario|Sault Ste. Marie]] to [[Montreal]] (including [[Greater Sudbury|Sudbury]], [[North Bay, Ontario|North Bay]] and [[Ottawa]]) received between 6 and 10&amp;nbsp;inches of snow (15–25&amp;nbsp;cm) on March 2. 80,000 customers lost power in the province with localized heavy amount across the [[Appalachians]]. Although Toronto did not receive large amounts of snow around 10&amp;nbsp;cm (4 in.), hours of freezing rain that followed created a hazardoussituation the next day when the temperature rose in the city core and under the [[CN Tower]] causing massive chunks of ice sheets to cascade off the buildings hundreds of metres below, breaking some vehicle windows in a hotel parking lot. It forced City police to close the [[Gardiner Expressway]] on March 5.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.citynews.ca/news/news_8456.aspx |title=CityNews: Gardiner Could Be Open For Morning Rush |publisher=Citynews.ca |accessdate=January 17, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071014031752/http://www.citynews.ca/news/news_8456.aspx |archivedate=October 14, 2007 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.omaha.com/index.php?u_page=2798&amp;u_sid=2340718 |title=Metro/Region Section |publisher=Omaha.com |date=December 20, 2011 |accessdate=January 17, 2012 }}{{dead link|date=October 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/manitoba/story/2007/03/01/storm-roads.html |work=CBC News |title=Treacherous roads blamed for accidents |date=March 1, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080417180755/http://www.cbc.ca/canada/manitoba/story/2007/03/01/storm-roads.html |archivedate=April 17, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.crh.noaa.gov/crnews/display_story.php?wfo=oax&amp;storyid=6356&amp;source=0&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2007/03/02/storm-wrap.html |work=CBC News |title=Storm blankets Quebec, aims for Maritimes |date=March 2, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080417181544/http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2007/03/02/storm-wrap.html |archivedate=April 17, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===March===

====March 3–4====
Portions of northern China and [[Mongolia]] were hit by the worst winter storm in over 50 years. The provinces of [[Liaoning]] and [[Shenyang]] had adopted emergency measures in able to cope with the storm which shut down numerous highways and canceled numerous flights while disrupting train service. Strong winds created  snow drifts of up to 2&amp;nbsp;meters deep.

Rescue ships had to assist a large group of fisherman on the [[Yellow Sea]] following a storm tide. Two people were killed in [[Tianjin]] when a storm surge collapsed several warehouses. As much as 50&amp;nbsp;cm (20&amp;nbsp;inches) fell in the province in [[Heilongjiang]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lcn.canoe.com/lcn/infos/lemonde/archives/2007/03/20070305-083018.html |title=La pire chute de neige en 50 ans – LCN – Le monde |publisher=Lcn.canoe.com |date=April 23, 2009 |accessdate=January 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.china.org.cn/english/environment/201668.htm |title=Sudden Storm Startles North China – |publisher=China.org.cn |date=March 6, 2007 |accessdate=January 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====March 14–15====
[[Jordan]]'s second winter storm of the season shut down most roads, schools and businesses across much of the country due to accumulations exceeding 4&amp;nbsp;inches (10&amp;nbsp;cm) including the capital of [[Amman, Jordan|Amman]].

Much of the Middle East usually have little or no snow during the winters due to much warmer conditions caused by the moderate sea effects from the [[Mediterranean Sea]]. However 3&amp;nbsp;feet (90&amp;nbsp;cm) of snow fell in a storm 2004, which was the worst since 1950.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=https://www.usatoday.com/weather/news/2007-03-15-jordan-snow_N.htm?csp=34 | work=USA Today | title=Rare snowstorm closes roads, schools, businesses in Jordan | date=March 15, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====March 16–17====

=====The north eastern US snow event=====
A heavy [[nor'easter]] caused severe [[Precipitation (meteorology)|Precipitation]] that started as rain across the region during the evening of the 15th, but as colder air moved in aloft, precipitation changed quickly to snow in [[The Poconos]] around Midnight EDT on the 16th and in [[Berks County, Pennsylvania|Berks County]] and the [[Lehigh Valley]] around 7&amp;nbsp;am EDT.  Farther to the south, the surge of cold air was confined to a more shallower layer and precipitation changed to sleet around the [[Greater Philadelphia]] Metropolitan Area between 6&amp;nbsp;am and 9&amp;nbsp;am EDT.  Precipitation continued as mainly sleet across the greater Philadelphia through the evening.  The nor'easter caused heavy sleet to fall across the greater [[Philadelphia Metropolitan Area]], heavy snow and sleet also fell across Berks County, the [[Lehigh Valley]] and heavy snow hit the Poconos on both the 16th into the early morning of the 17th.

The winter storm caused scores of accidents.  Various vehicles rolled over, slid off roads, slid into each other, slammed into guardrails and fishtailed.  The afternoon and evening [[commuting|commute]] slowed to a crawl.  In the [[Greater Philadelphia Metropolitan Area]], about 265 schools dismissed early and more than 60 community events were either cancelled or postponed on the 17th.  A few schools also closed on the 16th, but most of the others had early dismissals and many after school activities were postponed.  Some state offices and county courts also closed early and several municipalities declared [[snow emergencies]] over the March 16 to 18.

The winter storm wreaked havoc at [[Philadelphia International Airport]] had most flights on the 16th cancelled and it took a couple of days for flights to return to normal.  The largest impact of the winter storm within Philadelphia was the cancellation of most of the 1,200 scheduled flights at the Philadelphia International Airport.  About 1,000 people were stranded at the airport the night of the 16th.  Passengers on about 15 [[US Airways|U.S. Airways]] planes sat on the tarmac for over four hours before gates became available to deplane them.  Operations resumed on the 17th, but U.S. Airways still had to cancel about one quarter of its flights because the weather prevented crews and planes from arriving in Philadelphia.  About 100 travelers slept at the airport on the night of the 18th.  Normal operations resumed on the 19th.

The [[Pennsylvania Interscholastic Athletic Association]] postponed several state playoff high school basketball games.  A couple of [[Saint Patrick's Day]] parades scheduled for Saturday the 17th were also postponed on the 16th.  The [[Philadelphia Flyers]] hockey team was forced to fly out of [[Atlantic City International Airport]] on the 17th.  The horse racing card at [[Philadelphia Park]] was also cancelled for three days.

On the 17th snow accumulations averaged {{convert|4|to|6|in}} in the local [[Philadelphia area]], {{convert|5|to|9|in}} in Berks County and the Lehigh Valley and {{convert|12|to|18|in}} in the Poconos.

In Berks County and the Lehigh Valley, the snow mixed with and changed over to sleet during the later afternoon and the first half of the evening before it went back to all snow.  Precipitation ended early in the day on the 17th (before 3&amp;nbsp;am EDT) as mainly snow in all areas.  Elsewhere in Bucks County, portions of the [[Northeast Extension of the Pennsylvania Turnpike]] near [[Quakertown, Pennsylvania|Quakertown]] were stalled when two tractor-trailers collided in the southbound lanes at 2&amp;nbsp;pm EDT.  A six-mile back-up occurred. About 1,900 homes and businesses lost power in [[Newtown, Schuylkill County, Pennsylvania|Newtown]] after a vehicle struck a pole.

The sleet forced the closure of the eastbound lanes of the [[Vine Expressway]] within the city for about half an hour between the [[Schuylkill Expressway]] and [[Interstate 95]] for its removal.  In [[Montgomery County, Pennsylvania|Montgomery County]], in Montgomery Township, an accident on [[Pennsylvania Route 309|Pennsylvania State Route 309]] and Taylor Road badly injured one person.  In [[Towamencin Township]], two accidents resulted in two injuries occurring.

In [[Chester County, Pennsylvania|Chester County]], the state police reported 46 accidents in the central part of the county, but only one reported injury.  A woman was hospitalized after a crash on [[Pennsylvania Route 113|Pennsylvania State Route 113]] in [[Phoenixville, Pennsylvania|Phoenixville]].  Several businesses in the county closed early.  In Berks County, in Union Township one vehicle slid off a road and landed upside down in a creek.  The driver was treated for non-threatening life injuries.  A serious accident occurred on [[Old U.S. Route 22]] in [[Lenhartsville]].

The Lehigh Valley had a number of serious accidents on [[Interstate 78]].  In Lehigh County, a tractor-trailer jack-knifed near [[Pennsylvania Route 100|Pennsylvania State Route 100]] at [[Fogelsville, Pennsylvania|Fogelsville]] and closed the interstate from 330 p.m. EDT through 515 p.m. EDT.  Both southbound lanes of the [[Interstate 476|Pennsylvania Turnpike Northeast Extension]] were closed from 155 p.m. EDT through 420 p.m. EDT after two tractor-trailers and a car collided in [[Lower Milford Township, Lehigh County, Pennsylvania|Lower Milford Township]].  Many flights at the [[Lehigh Valley International Airport]] were delayed, a couple were cancelled.

[[File:Lehighvalleymap.png|thumb|right|175px|The location of the [[Lehigh Valley]] area.]]
Commuter buses bringing workers home from New York City had long delays.  In [[Northampton County, Pennsylvania|Northampton County]], a [[tractor-trailer]] [[jackknifed]] on the eastbound lanes of Interstate 78 about 4&amp;nbsp;pm EDT near the [[Pennsylvania State Route 33]] junction.  All lanes were not reopened until 545 p.m. EDT.  In [[Moore Township, Northampton County, Pennsylvania|Moore Township]], a [[school bus]] collided head-on with a car.  Both drivers, but no children were injured.

In [[Lower Mount Bethel Township]], a [[Jeep Cherokee (XJ)|Jeep Cherokee]] slid into a home on [[Pennsylvania State Route 611]] and injured the driver.  A [[Ford Explorer]] driver was injured after the vehicle struck a tree in [[Wind Gap]].  Problems on Lehigh Valley roadways continued long after the snow and sleet ended.  A driver was injured on [[U.S. Route 22]] in [[Whitehall Township, Pennsylvania|Whitehall Township]] (Lehigh County) when ice chunks from a tractor-trailer hit their vehicle.  In [[Upper Macungie Township]] (Lehigh County), ice chunks that flew off a [[Wal-Mart]] tractor-trailer cracked the windshield and dented the hood of a vehicle on [[Interstate 78]] near the [[Pennsylvania State Route 100]]'s exit.

In the Poconos, many shopping malls and [[sports complex]]es closed early.  In [[Monroe County, Pennsylvania|Monroe County]], a [[flipped over]] truck snarled traffic on [[U.S. Route 209]] and [[Pennsylvania State Route 33]].  A jack-knifed tractor-trailer on eastbound [[Interstate 80]] near [[Stroudsburg]] snarled the evening commute to a crawl.

=====North eastern US snow depths=====
Snow and sleet depth totals across the north eastern US included {{convert|18.0|in}} in [[Albrightsville]] ([[Carbon County, Pennsylvania|Carbon County]]) and [[Effort, Pennsylvania|Effort]] ([[Monroe County, Pennsylvania|Monroe County]]), {{convert|15.4|in}} in [[Lehighton]] (Carbon County) it was at {{convert|14.5|in}}. In [[Tobyhanna, Pennsylvania|Tobyhanna]] (Monroe County), {{convert|14.2|in}} in [[East Stroudsburg]] (Monroe County) it was at {{convert|10.0|in}}. In [[Slatington, Pennsylvania|Slatington]] ([[Lehigh County]]) it was at {{convert|8.5|in}} in [[West Reading, Pennsylvania|Reading]] (Berks County) and at the [[Lehigh Valley International Airport]] it was at  {{convert|6.5|in}}.

In [[Wynnewood, Pennsylvania|Wynnewood]] ([[Montgomery County, Pennsylvania|Montgomery County]]) and at the [[Philadelphia International Airport]] it was {{convert|3.0|in}}.

=====The storm event in Canada=====
A strong [[High-pressure area|high pressure system]] moved across nearby parts of Canada and supplied a fresh supply of cold air into the region.

Hundreds of traffic accidents occurred across the northeast and Canada including one involving a vehicle from [[George W. Bush]]'s [[motorcade]] in Washington, D.C..

=====The metrological cause of the storm=====
The winter storm was caused by a [[nor'easter]] [[low pressure system]] that developed on a cold front that moved through the area on the 15th.  Prior to that, unseasonably mild air helped push high temperatures as high as the 70s.

Meanwhile, the low pressure system formed over [[South Carolina]] and [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] on the morning of the 16th and moved northeast. At 2&amp;nbsp;pm EDT on the 16th, it was near [[Myrtle Beach]], [[South Carolina]]; at 8&amp;nbsp;pm EDT that evening, it was just east of [[Virginia Beach]]; at 2&amp;nbsp;am EDT on the 17th, it was about {{convert|100|mi}} east of [[Atlantic City]], [[New Jersey]] and was about {{convert|100|mi}} south of [[Cape Cod]], [[Massachusetts]] at 8&amp;nbsp;am EDT on the 17th.  As central pressures go, this was not particularly a powerful system; it was only 996 millibars the morning of the 17th.  What contributed to the event, was the strong high pressure system (about 1040 millibars the morning of the 16th).  It supplied the fresh cold air needed to change the precipitation over to sleet and freezing rain and increased the pressure gradient (and consequently the wind) between itself and the developing nor'easter low pressure system.

=====Fatalities=====
The only seriouse reported traffic fatality from the storm in [[Eastern Pennsylvania]] occurred in [[Bucks County]].  An 18-year-old girl from [[Plumstead Township]] was killed when her vehicle crossed the center line of an icy [[Durham Road]] and collided with a dump truck on the 16th.

So far, 10 people have been killed by the storm, all in traffic accidents. This includes six in [[New Jersey]], three in [[Pennsylvania]] and one in [[Maryland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2007/WEATHER/03/17/winter.storm.ap/index.html |work=CNN |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070329015203/http://www.cnn.com/2007/WEATHER/03/17/winter.storm.ap/index.html |archivedate=March 29, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====March 26–29====
A storm moved onto the coast on March 26, dropping up to 2&amp;nbsp;feet of snow in the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]]. The storm moved across the [[Intermountain West]] on the 27th and developed into a major winter storm across the northern and central Rockies and northern High Plains. Many of the western valleys, from the [[Wasatch Front]] through the valleys of [[Wyoming]], onto the Plains of Wyoming and [[Montana]], saw about 6–12&amp;nbsp;inches of snow, with 1–2&amp;nbsp;feet in the mountains from the 27th through the 29th. Up to 3&amp;nbsp;feet fell in the [[Wasatch Range]] and [[Bighorn Mountains]]. The storm was concentrated around south-central Montana and north-central Wyoming, where such cities as [[Sheridan, Wyoming|Sheridan]] and [[Billings, Montana|Billings]] and surrounding areas could see 1–2&amp;nbsp;feet of snow. Throughout the mountains and on the Plains (including Saskatchewan and Manitoba), this snow was  accompanied by strong winds, leading to localized near-blizzard to blizzard conditions.

===April===

====April 2–7====
[[Image:Dreaming of a White Good Friday.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Parts of Pennsylvania, including countryside around [[Volant, Pennsylvania|Volant]], received much snow on Good Friday and the following days.]]

A late season winter storm dumped a large swath of snow from North and South Dakota, eastward through Minnesota, Wisconsin and into Upper Michigan.  Up to 9&amp;nbsp;inches of snow fell near [[Bismarck, North Dakota]], 11&amp;nbsp;inches in [[Brainerd, Minnesota]], and areas near [[Hurley, Wisconsin]] received 18&amp;nbsp;inches.  Parts of Upper and northern Michigan then saw a major Lake Effect event over approximately five days.  [[Painesdale, Michigan]] received 65&amp;nbsp;inches of snow and the National Weather Service in [[Marquette, Michigan|Marquette]] received 47&amp;nbsp;inches, shattering most previous April snowfall records for that city.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.crh.noaa.gov/crnews/display_story.php?wfo=mqt&amp;storyid=7174&amp;source=0&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=the Associated Press |url=http://www.bismarcktribune.com/articles/2007/04/04/news/state/131392.txt |title=Bismarck Tribune – North Dakota News – Storm leaves vehicles stuck |publisher=Bismarcktribune.com |date=April 3, 2007 |accessdate=January 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kare11.com/news/news_article.aspx?storyid=250088 |title=New Header |publisher=Kare11.com |accessdate=January 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Pathieu |first=Diane |url=http://www.todaystmj4.com/news/local/6863747.html |title=Wind Reminds Us That Winter Still Lingers &amp;#124; Today's TMJ4 – Milwaukee, Wisconsin News, Weather, Sports, WTMJ &amp;#124; Local News |publisher=Todaystmj4.com |accessdate=January 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.greenbaypressgazette.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20070405/GPG0101/704050571/1207/GPGnews Green Bay Press-Gazette – The article requested can not be found!

In northern New England, the storm hit on Wednesday afternoon and left behind up to a foot and a half of snow, sleet, and freezing rain.  Over 180,000 homes lost power, mostly due to broken tree limbs snapping wires.  The storm has caused at least one death.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2007/WEATHER/04/05/spring.storm.ap/index.html |work=CNN |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070410141953/http://www.cnn.com/2007/WEATHER/04/05/spring.storm.ap/index.html |archivedate=April 10, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Heavy snow also fell across much of southern and central Quebec, with amounts in excess of 12 inches (30&amp;nbsp;cm) across some areas, with higher amounts over higher terrain in the [[Charlevoix]] region. Numerous accidents were reported across the provinces including one involving a firetruck. Two people were killed in accidents across the province.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radio-canada.ca/regions/Quebec/2007/04/05/001-meteo_neige.shtml |title=Journée difficile sur la route |publisher=Radio-canada.ca |accessdate=January 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the back side of the storm, persistent heavy flurries gave additional accumulations of a few inches across most of Ontario and Quebec.

====April 8====
Another winter storm affected portions of [[New Brunswick]], Nova Scotia, Quebec and [[Prince Edward Island]] on Easter Sunday dumping as much as {{convert|12|in|cm}} of snow locally along with strong winds which caused flight cancellations at [[Halifax International Airport]] and scattered power outages, mainly in Nova Scotia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.canada.com/ottawacitizen/news/story.html?id=34ac3e20-d310-4c5f-a33c-c8e040273dc7&amp;k=67228 |title=Spring storm hammers east coast with snow, wind |publisher=Canada.com |date=April 9, 2007 |accessdate=January 17, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121108223214/http://www.canada.com/ottawacitizen/news/story.html?id=34ac3e20-d310-4c5f-a33c-c8e040273dc7&amp;k=67228 |archivedate=November 8, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main article|North Sea flood of 2007}}

A [[European windstorm]] crosses over Scotland and plunges into the mouth of the [[North Sea]], to the west of Norway, where its strong winds push large bodies of water Southeast, towards coastal regions in England and the Netherlands. The tidal surge puts both nations on red alert as the English evacuate some coastal villages and close the [[Thames Barrier]]. The Dutch close the [[Oosterscheldekering|Eastern Scheldt storm surge barrier]] and the enormous [[Maeslantkering|Maeslant barrier]] in order to prevent massive flooding as the storm mimics the situation that caused the devastating [[North Sea flood of 1953]]. For the first time since 1976, the entire Dutch coastline is put on alert and is closely monitored by officials. The tidal surge turned out to be too weak to cause any significant damage to the strong Dutch coastal defenses. In England, only minor flooding occurred.

Further to the west in southeastern Europe, the storm dumped exceptional amounts of snow over parts of Austria with local reports of over a meter of snow. Some meteorologists mentioned that the weather that took place in the [[Alps]] was a once in every 30 to 50 year occurrence.

===December===

====November 30 – December 2====

Preceding the large winter storm, a significant winter storm affected portions of the Canadian Maritimes and [[Newfoundland and Labrador]] on December 2. Initially a weak disturbance, it produced significant lake-effect snows across the traditional snow belts on the southern shores of Lakes [[Lake Superior|Superior]], [[Lake Michigan|Michigan]], [[Lake Huron|Huron]] and [[Lake Ontario|Ontario]] as well as [[Georgian Bay]]. The disturbance intensified over the Maritimes and dumped heavy amounts of snow across [[Prince Edward Island]] and [[Newfoundland and Labrador]] where accumulations of 8 to 20&amp;nbsp;inches (20–50&amp;nbsp;cm) were reported over central parts of the province. The storm registered a minimum of 957 mb off the Atlantic Coast two days later. Due to heavy snow, strong winds, sleet and freezing rain, over 100,000 customers in Newfoundland lost power, with a large portion of the capital [[St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador|St. John's]] being blacked out for several hours. In the [[Bonavista Peninsula]], several transmission lines and support structures collapsed and telephone service was also disabled for a certain period including cellphone coverage. Some residents remained without power for over a week.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/canada/newfoundland-labrador/story/2007/12/03/winter-blast.html Power lines torn down in eastern Newfoundland], ''CBC'',  December 3, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/canada/newfoundland-labrador/story/2007/12/04/power-outage.html Week may pass before all juice restored: Newfoundland Power], ''CBC'',  December 4, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

A series of winter storms impacted widespread areas of North America over a nine-day period. From December 8 to December 11, another major ice storm impacted the midsection of the United States from Texas, northeast through the Midwest, through the [[Mid-Atlantic States]], and into southern [[New England]]. At least 38&amp;nbsp;people were killed by the ice storms, including 23 in [[Oklahoma]], four in [[Kansas]], three in [[Missouri]], and one in [[Nebraska]]. Most of the fatalities were the result of traffic accidents caused by the icy weather, including four people in a single accident on [[Interstate 40]] west of [[Okemah, Oklahoma]]. The storm caused the largest power outage in Oklahoma history, where 600,000 homes and businesses lost power, while 350,000 customers were also without power in other states, including 100,000 in both [[Missouri]] and Kansas, and scattered power outages in [[Nebraska]], [[Iowa]], and [[Illinois]]. Overall, over 1.5&amp;nbsp;million customers lost power throughout the Central United States with some being without electricity for over one week. The storms caused widespread school and flight cancellations with [[Chicago O'Hare International Airport]] cancelling at least 560 flights, while [[Tulsa International Airport]] was forced to halt flights on the 10th after losing power for 10&amp;nbsp;hours.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/22173398/ Ice coats nation's midsection], ''Associated Press via MSNBC'', Dec. 10, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/2007/US/weather/12/10/winter.ice.storm.ap/index.html More icy weather headed for Midwest] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071211115256/http://www.cnn.com/2007/US/weather/12/10/winter.ice.storm.ap/index.html |date=December 11, 2007 }}, ''CNN'', Dec. 10, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

The energy of the second ice storm produced significant snows over the northeastern part of the US and the [[Golden Horseshoe]] region of Ontario on December 13 and dumped as much as 12&amp;nbsp;inches (30&amp;nbsp;cm) of snow in parts of New England and New York state.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wfsb.com/news/14855677/detail.html Rell Criticized For Storm Response] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071216071217/http://www.wfsb.com/news/14855677/detail.html |date=December 16, 2007 }}, ''[[WFSB]]'', December 14, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; A large system crossed the Central and Eastern part of the continent from December 15 to December 17 dumping as much as {{convert|20|in|cm}} over parts of Ontario and New England with mixed precipitation south of the heavy snow bands. The snow storm was responsible for at least 17 deaths across five states and three Canadian provinces as well as numerous flights and school cancellations from Michigan to the Canadian Maritimes.

====December 18====
After a mild start to the cold season, a large area of Spain was hit by its first winter storm of the season which brought heavy snow and rain as well as strong winds and much colder temperatures. In the eastern part of the country, several roads were closed due to high amounts of snow. Portions of a key road link between [[Madrid]] and [[Barcelona]] was also shut down due to the weather.&lt;ref&gt;Ball, Steph, [http://www.bbc.co.uk/weather/world/news/19122007news.shtml Spain’s first winter storm blankets half the Peninsula with snow], ''BBC'', December 19, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

====December 21–24====
A new winter storm affected most of Central North America from the [[Texas Panhandle]] to northern Ontario while heavy rains, areas of freezing rain, very strong winds and warm temperatures affected most of Eastern North America. Blizzard warnings were issued at one point over southwestern Kansas and locally a foot of snow fell in some regions with several regions registering wind gusts of over {{convert|50|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}}. Up to a foot of snow fell across much of Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Michigan, and freezing rain was also reported in many areas. Parts of [[Upper Peninsula of Michigan|Michigan's Upper Peninsula]] saw upwards of {{convert|15|in|cm}} of snow. The storm also produced strong winds, including wind gusts of {{convert|88|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} across [[Lake Michigan]], and gusts ranging from 50–68&amp;nbsp;mph across the [[Chicago metropolitan area|Chicago area]]. The winds caused 300 flights to be canceled at Chicago-O'Hare International Airport. Also in Chicago, crews reported that 170 signals had been knocked out and more than 500 reports of fallen limbs had been attributed to the storm. 11,000 customers in Wisconsin, 92,000 in Michigan and 225,000 in Illinois lost power. The storm was responsible for at least 25 deaths across seven US states and one Canadian province, including eight in Minnesota, three in Indiana, three in [[Wyoming]], five in Wisconsin, one in Texas, one in Kansas, one in Michigan, and three in New Brunswick. In Texas, the fatal crash included 50 vehicles on [[Interstate 40]] while in Kansas and Missouri crashes on [[Interstate 70]] and [[Interstate 29]] respectively also involved several vehicles. Lake-effect snows across the traditional [[snowbelt]] region in the Great Lakes also fell on Christmas Eve.&lt;ref&gt;[http://edition.cnn.com/2007/US/weather/12/23/winter.storm.ap/index.html   11 die in massive winter storm], ''Associated Press via CNN'', December 23, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://edition.cnn.com/2007/US/weather/12/24/winter.storm.ap/index.html  Here comes the sun in Midwest, but icy roads remain], ''Associated Press via CNN'', December 24, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.canada.com/ottawacitizen/news/story.html?id=746b8277-59ea-4945-aa62-944604dfde22 Mounties name three men killed in N.B. auto crash] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121108223447/http://www.canada.com/ottawacitizen/news/story.html?id=746b8277-59ea-4945-aa62-944604dfde22 |date=November 8, 2012 }}, ''Ottawa Citizen'', December 24, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/22358933/ Holiday storm eases, leaving at least 22 dead], ''Associated via MSNBC'', Dec. 24, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Homonuclear molecules''', or '''homonuclear species''', are [[molecule]]s composed of only one type of [[Chemical element|element]]. Homonuclear molecules may consist of various numbers of [[atom]]s, depending on the element's properties. Some elements form molecules of more than one size. [[Noble gas]]es rarely form bonds, so they only have one atom. The most familiar homonuclear molecules are [[diatomic]], meaning they consist of two [[atom]]s, though not all diatomic molecules are homonuclear. Homonuclear diatomic molecules include [[hydrogen]] (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), [[oxygen]] (O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), [[nitrogen]] (N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and all of the [[halogen]]s. [[Ozone]] (O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) is a common triatomic homonuclear molecule. Homonuclear tetratomic molecules include [[arsenic]] (As&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) and [[phosphorus]] (P&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;).

[[Allotrope]]s are different chemical forms of the same element (not containing any other element).  In that sense, allotropes are all homonuclear. Many elements have multiple allotropic forms. In addition to the most common form of gaseous oxygen, O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and ozone, there are other [[allotropes of oxygen]]. [[Sulfur]] forms several [[allotropes of sulfur|allotropes]] containing different numbers of sulfur atoms, including [[diatomic element|diatomic]], triatomic, [[wikt:hexatomic|hexatomic]] and [[octatomic element|octatomic]] ([[disulfur|S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]], [[trisulfur|S&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]], [[hexasulfur|S&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]], [[octasulfur|S&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;]]) forms, though the first three are rare. The element [[carbon]] is known to have a number of homonuclear molecules, the best known being [[buckminsterfullerene]] or "buckyball".{{dubious|diamond, graphite, amorphous carbon, and possibly graphene might be better known than buckyballs|date=August 2018}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8151">[[File:Silfurberg.jpg|right|thumb|Iceland spar, possibly the Icelandic medieval sun stone used to locate the sun in the sky when obstructed from view.&lt;ref name="VikingPolarization" /&gt;]]
'''Iceland spar''', formerly known as '''Iceland crystal''' ({{lang-is|silfurberg}}; lit. ''silver-rock''), is a transparent variety of [[calcite]], or crystallized [[calcium carbonate]], originally brought from [[Iceland]], and used in demonstrating the [[polarization of light]] (see [[polarimetry]]).&lt;ref name="1913Websters"/&gt;&lt;ref name="OEDIcelandspar"/&gt; It occurs in large readily [[Cleavage (crystal)|cleavable]] crystals, is easily divisible into [[rhomb|rhombuse]]s, and is remarkable for its [[birefringence]].&lt;ref name="Websters1828"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Miers2010"/&gt;  This means that the [[index of refraction]] of the crystal is different for light of different [[polarization (waves)|polarization]].  A ray of unpolarized light passing through the crystal divides into two rays of perpendicular polarization directed at different angles, called [[double refraction]]. So objects seen through the crystal appear doubled.

Historically, the double-refraction property of this crystal was important to understanding the nature of light as a wave.  This was studied at length by [[Christiaan Huygens]]&lt;ref name="Huy1690"/&gt; and [[Isaac Newton]].&lt;ref name="1728Cyclopaedia" /&gt; [[Sir George Stokes, 1st Baronet#Polarization|Sir George Stokes]] also studied the phenomenon.&lt;ref name="Larmor2010"/&gt;  Its complete explanation in terms of light polarization was published by [[Augustin-Jean Fresnel]] in the 1820s.&lt;ref name="Whittaker" /&gt;

[[Mining|Mine]]s producing Iceland spar include many mines producing related calcite and [[aragonite]] as well as those famously in Iceland,&lt;ref name="Russell2008" /&gt; productively in the greater [[Sonoran desert]] region as in [[Santa Eulalia, Chihuahua]], [[Mexico]]&lt;ref name="GraniteGap"/&gt; and [[New Mexico]], United States,&lt;ref name="Kelly1940" /&gt; as well as in the [[People's Republic of China]].&lt;ref name="Guizhou"/&gt;

==Viking "sunstone"==
{{main article|Sunstone (medieval)}}
It has been speculated that the [[Sunstone (medieval)|sunstone]] ({{lang-non|sólarsteinn}}, a different mineral from the gem-quality [[sunstone]]) mentioned in medieval Icelandic texts{{which|date=November 2013}} was Iceland spar, and that [[Viking]]s used its light-polarizing property to tell the direction of the sun on cloudy days for [[Longship#Navigation|navigational]] purposes.&lt;ref name="VikingPolarization" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Karlsen2003" /&gt; The polarization of sunlight in the [[Arctic]] can be detected,&lt;ref name="peasoup" /&gt; and the direction of the sun identified to within a few degrees in both cloudy and twilight conditions using the sunstone and the naked eye.&lt;ref name="Ropars11" /&gt; The process involves moving the stone across the visual field to reveal a yellow [[Entoptic phenomenon|entoptic pattern]] on the [[Fovea centralis|fovea]] of the eye, probably [[Haidinger's brush]]. The recovery of an Iceland spar sunstone from the Elizabethan ship ''Alderney'', which sank in 1592, suggests that this navigational technology may have persisted after the invention of the magnetic [[compass]].&lt;ref&gt;''[https://web.archive.org/web/20170702072159/https://www.seeker.com/first-evidence-of-viking-like-sunstone-found-1767286293.html First evidence of Viking-like 'sunstone' found]''. Discovery.com. Accessed 8 March 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nicol prism==

[[William Nicol (geologist)|William Nicol]] (1770–1851) invented the  first polarizing prism, using Iceland spar to create his [[Nicol prism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://physics.kenyon.edu/EarlyApparatus/Polarized_Light/Nicol_Prism/Nicol_Prism.html | title=Nicol Prism | publisher=Kenyon College | accessdate=23 January 2014 | author=Greenslade, Thomas B., Jr.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Industrial waste''' is the waste produced by industrial activity which includes any material that is rendered useless during a manufacturing process such as that of [[factories]], industries, mills, and mining operations. It has existed since the start of the [[Industrial Revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Maczulak |first=Anne Elizabeth |year=2010 |title=Pollution: Treating Environmental Toxins |url= |location=New York |publisher=Infobase Publishing |page=120 |isbn=9781438126333}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some examples of industrial wastes are [[chemical solvent]]s, pigments, sludge, metals, ash, paints, sandpaper, paper products, industrial [[by-products]], and [[radioactive wastes]].

[[Toxic waste]], [[chemical waste]], industrial solid waste and [[municipal solid waste]] are designations of industrial wastes. [[Sewage treatment]] plants can treat some industrial wastes, i.e. those consisting of [[conventional pollutant]]s such as [[biochemical oxygen demand]] (BOD). Industrial wastes containing [[toxic]] pollutants require specialized treatment systems. (''See'' [[Industrial wastewater treatment]]).&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Washington, DC (2011). [http://www.epa.gov/npdes/pubs/pretreatment_program_intro_2011.pdf "Introduction to the National Pretreatment Program"] Document no. EPA-833-B-11-001. pp. 1-1, 1-2.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Environmental Impact ==
Production sites are commonly located near bodies of water due to industrial dependence on large amounts of water as an input. Many areas that are becoming industrialized do not yet have the resources or technology to dispose of waste with lesser effects on the environment. Both untreated and partially treated wastewater are commonly fed back into a near lying body of water. Metals, chemicals and sewage released into bodies of water directly affect marine ecosystems and the health of those who depend on the waters as food or drinking water sources. Toxins from the wastewater can kill off marine life or cause varying degrees of illness to those who consume these marine animals, depending on the contaminant. Metals and chemicals released into bodies of water affect the [[Marine ecosystem|marine ecosystems]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Wastes in Marine Environments|last=U.S. Congress|first=Office of Technology’ Assessment|publisher=Washington, DC: U.S. Government Printing Office|year=1987|isbn=|location=Washington, DC|pages=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wastewater containing nitrates and phosphates often causes [[Eutrophication]] which can kill off existing life in the water. A Thailand study focusing on water pollution origins found that the highest concentrations of water contamination in the U-tapao river had a direct correlation to industrial wastewater. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gyawali at al.|first=|date=2012|title=Effects of Industrial Waste Disposal on the Surface Water Quality of U-tapao River, Thailand|url=http://www.ipcbee.com/vol32/019-ICESE2012-D10030.pdf|journal=2012 International Conference on Environment Science and Engieering|volume=32|pages=5|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Management==

===In Thailand===
{{Main|Industrial waste management in Thailand}}

In [[Thailand]] the roles in [[Municipal solid waste|Municipal solid waste (MSW)]] management and industrial waste management are organized by the Royal Thai Government, which is then divided into central government, regional government, and local government.

===In the United States===
{{main|Solid waste policy in the United States}}
The 1976 [[Resource Conservation and Recovery Act]] (RCRA) provides for federal regulation of waste while allowing for individual state control through [[EPA]] approved waste disposal programs.

State compliance is monitored by EPA inspections. In the case that waste management guideline standards are not met, action against the site will be taken. Compliance errors may be corrected by enforced cleanup directly by the site responsible for the waste or by a third party hired by that site.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.epa.gov/rcra/resource-conservation-and-recovery-act-rcra-overview#howdoesrcrawork|title=Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) Overview {{!}} US EPA|last=EPA,OSWER,ORCR|first=US|website=US EPA|language=en|access-date=2018-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to this act, open dumping or releasing wastewater into nearby bodies of water were common waste disposal methods. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brown et. al|first=|date=June 1977|title=Reassessing the History of U.S. Hazardous Waste

The RCRA framework provides specified subsections defining nonhazardous and hazardous waste materials and how each should be properly managed and disposed of. Guidelines for the disposal of nonhazardous solid waste includes the banning of open dumping. Hazardous waste is monitored in a [[cradle to grave]] fashion.The EPA now manages 2.96 million tons of solid, hazardous and industrial waste. Since establishment, the RCRA has undergone reforms as inefficiencies arise and as waste management evolves. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The '''January 25–27, 2011 North American blizzard''' was a major [[Mid-Atlantic states|Mid-Atlantic]] [[nor'easter]] and winter storm, and a [[New England]] [[blizzard]] that affected portions of the [[Northeastern United States|northeastern]] United States and Canada. This storm came just two weeks after a previous major blizzard had already affected most of these same areas earlier on the same month of [[January 8–13, 2011 North American blizzard|January 2011]]. The storm also came just one month after a previous major  blizzard that affected the entire area after Christmas in [[December 2010 North American blizzard|December 2010]]. This storm was the third significant snowstorm to affect the region during the 2010–11 North American winter storm season. It was followed a few days later by [[January 31 – February 2, 2011 North American blizzard|another massive storm]] that blanketed much of the United States and Canada.

==Impact==

The words "Metro-North Commuter Railroad" and the Connecticut state seal are visible on one side of the front.  Its roof is covered with snow. In the rear right is a dull yellow off-center snow-covered gabled canopy with the words "New Canaan" in the field sheltering a concrete platform.]]

===New England===
Reports of 10–15 inches were common in southern [[New England]].&lt;ref name="weather2"&gt;[http://www.weather.com/outlook/weather-news/news/articles/northeast-snowstorm-totals_2011-01-27 Yet Another Major Snowstorm Hits Northeast] www.weather.com&lt;/ref&gt;

===New Jersey===
Near 20 inches were reported on the ground at [[Newark, New Jersey]] by January 27, where snowfall rates were at 3 to 4 inches an hour. Portions of Southern New Jersey saw variable snow amounts. Atlantic City saw about 3 inches of snow and Cape May reported about 2.5".  All across the central portion of the state from [[Westfield, New Jersey|Westfield Township]] to [[Freehold Township, New Jersey|Freehold]] reported snowfall amounts in the ranges of 21–26 inches.

===Connecticut===
There were multiple reports of 18–19 inches across the state.  During the Blizzard there were snowfall rates of up to 4 inches per hour. Within the first 2 hours of the storm, Meriden recorded 7.5 inches on the ground. The NWS forecasted 5–9 inches Thursday evening. Once the snow ended in the morning it was clear that forecast was underestimated. The higher amounts were in the southern and eastern portions of the state, with the least in the northwestern corner.

===New York===
[[File:NYC Blizzard January 2011 Lower East Side 6.jpg|thumb|The effects of the blizzard on [[Manhattan]]'s [[Lower East Side]].]]
At least 19 inches of snow accumulated in [[New York City]] in wake of the storm. As a result, for the ninth time in the city's history, all public schools were closed. All area airports were also closed. Airports re-opened later in the afternoon of January 27. All non-emergency city government offices were closed as well.&lt;ref name="weather2" /&gt; After the additional snowfall, this made January 2011 the snowiest January on record for New York City. The storm also caused two deaths. A 64-year-old woman was struck and killed by a snow plow on January 25.&lt;ref name="foxnyc"&gt;[http://www.myfoxny.com/dpps/news/greater-new-york-braces-for-heavy-winter-storm-dpgonc-20110126-gc_11604147 Greater New York Braces for Heavy Winter Storm] [[WNYW]], New York City, January 26, 2011. Retrieved 2011-01-27.&lt;/ref&gt; New York Mayor [[Michael Bloomberg]] declared a citywide weather emergency early on the 25th, which resulted in the closing of schools and government buildings as well as temporary closures of all of the area's Airports.&lt;ref name="foxnyc"/&gt;

===Pennsylvania===
[[Philadelphia]] received almost 15 inches of snow after the storm ended.&lt;ref name="weather2"/&gt; The one-two punch hit the local Philadelphia the hardest. Many municipalities declared snow emergencies.

There were more than three dozen accidents during the morning of the 26th. This included an ambulance on its way to a hospital with a patient in West Nantmeal Township (Chester County). No injuries were reported. SEPTA regional transportation reported service disruptions along with systemwide delays. Philadelphia International Airport had 41 morning flights cancelled and had average delays of three hours. With the first surge of snow on the morning of the 26th, many school districts made last minute decisions to either close or have delayed openings. Many closed early that afternoon. Even Saint Joseph's University and West Chester University closed. Conditions though became worse when the second punch of heavier snow came through on the evening of the 26th. Snowfall rates reached 2 to 4 inches per hour. In Philadelphia, the emergency 311 hot line had four times the normal rate of calls. Many vehicles and buses were stuck in the snow. Some SEPTA bus drivers were stranded up to twelve hours. SEPTA still had service suspended on about one third of its routes on the 28th.

About 1,500 travelers were stranded overnight on the 26th at Philadelphia International Airport. Schools and courts were closed on the 27th. Schools were also closed on the 28th. In the northwest suburbs, numerous crashes were reported in Berks, Chester and Montgomery Counties on Pennsylvania State Routes 100 and 29 as well as U.S. Routes 202 and 422. In West Pottsgrove (Montgomery County), a 45-year-old man was injured after his vehicle slid down an embankment on Westbound U.S. Route 422 and rolled over. In Northampton County, westbound Interstate 78 was closed for three hours overnight on the 26th between Pennsylvania State Routes 412 and 309 because of disabled commercial vehicles. The weight of the snow also downed some trees in the southeast part of the state, but power outages remained isolated. The continued onslaught of winter weather was causing numerous municipalities to exhaust their snow removal budgets. The city of Philadelphia estimated the clean-up costs from the latest winter storm was at least 6 million dollars.

Residents throughout the Philadelphia area reported [[thundersnow]], a rare meteorological phenomenon in which thunder and lightning occur concurrently with the falling snow. [[Chester County, Pennsylvania|Chester County]] received over 20 inches of snow.&lt;ref name="thunder"&gt;[http://www.philly2philly.com/politics_community/the_omelette/2011/1/27/46219/philadelphia_area_snow_totals_septa_passengers_stran Philadelphia Area Snow Totals] Philly2Philly.com, January 27, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Berks County, Pennsylvania|Berks County]] most residents received around 13–14 inches of snow.&lt;ref name="thunder"/&gt;

===Washington, D.C.===
[[Washington D.C.]] received 5 to 10 inches of heavy, wet snow.&lt;ref name="weather1"&gt;[http://www.weather.com/newscenter/stormwatch/ Less severe bouts of snow] Weather Channel, January 27, 2011.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2484">'''McIlvaine buffer''' is a [[buffer solution]] composed of [[citric acid]] and [[disodium hydrogen phosphate]], also known as '''citrate-phosphate buffer'''. It was introduced in 1921 by a [[United States]] agronomist Theodore Clinton McIlvaine from [[West Virginia University]], and can be prepared in [[pH]] 2.2 to 8 by mixing two stock solutions.&lt;ref name="McIlvaine"&gt;{{Cite journal|author = McIlvaine TC|year = 1921|title = A buffer solution for colorimetric comparison|journal = J. Biol. Chem.|volume = 49|issue = 1|pages = 183–186|url = http://www.jbc.org/content/49/1/183.full.pdf|format = pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==
McIlvaine buffer can be used to prepare a water-soluble [[mounting media]] when mixed 1:1 with glycerol.&lt;ref name="SA-Mount"&gt;{{cite web|title=Mycoplasma Detection|url=https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/content/dam/sigma-aldrich/docs/Sigma/Usage/b1155use.pdf|website=Sigma-Aldrich|accessdate=22 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contents==
Preparation of McIlvaine buffer requires [[disodium phosphate]] and [[citric acid]]. One liter of 0.2M stock solution of disodium phosphate can be prepared by dissolving 28.38g of disodium phosphate in water, and adding a quantity of water sufficient to make one liter. One liter of 0.1M stock solution of citric acid can be prepared by dissolving 19.21g of citric acid in water, and adding a quantity of water sufficient to make one liter. From these stock solutions, McIlvaine buffer can be prepared in accordance with the following table:

NEXT affords larger delivered payloads, smaller launch vehicle size, and other mission enhancements compared to chemical and other electric propulsion technologies for [[Discovery Program|Discovery]], [[New Frontiers program|New Frontiers]], [[Mars Exploration Program|Mars Exploration]], and [[Flagship Program|Flagship]] outer-planet exploration missions.&lt;ref name='2010 Qualification'/&gt;  [[Glenn Research Center]] manufactured the test engine's core ionization chamber, and [[Aerojet Rocketdyne]] designed and built the ion acceleration assembly.&lt;ref name=test/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nasa.gov/centers/glenn/news/pressrel/2013/13-021_thruster.html NASA Thruster Achieves World-Record 5+Years of Operation]. NASA. June 24, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;  The first two flight units will be available in early 2019.

==Performance==
The NEXT engine is a type of [[solar electric propulsion]] in which thruster systems use the electricity generated by the spacecraft's [[Solar panel on spacecraft|solar panel]] to accelerate the [[xenon]] propellant to speeds of up to 90,000&amp;nbsp;mph (145,000&amp;nbsp;km/h or 40 km/s).&lt;ref name=test/&gt; NEXT can produce 6.9&amp;nbsp;[[Watt#Kilowatt|kW]] thrust power and 236&amp;nbsp;[[Newton (unit)|mN]] [[thrust]].&lt;ref name='gizmag2013'&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.gizmag.com/next-ion-thruster-duration-record/28067/ | title= NASA's NEXT ion thruster runs five and a half years nonstop to set new record | author= David Szondy |accessdate=26 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can be throttled down to 0.5&amp;nbsp;kW power, and has a [[specific impulse]] of 4190 seconds (compared to 3120 for [[NASA Solar Technology Application Readiness|NSTAR]]).&lt;ref name='2010 Qualification'/&gt; The NEXT thruster has demonstrated a total impulse of 17 MN·s; which is the highest total impulse ever demonstrated by an ion thruster.&lt;ref name='2010 Qualification'/&gt;  A beam extraction area 1.6 times that of NSTAR allows higher thruster input power while maintaining low voltages and ion current densities, thus maintaining thruster longevity.&lt;ref name='2010 Qualification'/&gt;

==Tests==
In November 2010, it was revealed that the prototype had completed a 48,000 hours (5.5 years) test in December 2009.&lt;ref name=test&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.nasa.gov/home/hqnews/2013/jun/HQ_13-193_Ion_Thruster_Record.html | title= NASA Thruster Achieves World-Record 5+ Years of Operation | author=Dwayne Brown | author2=Katherine K.

Prior to the [[2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami]], Japan had generated 30% of its electrical power from nuclear reactors and planned to increase that share to 40%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nuclear Power in Japan|url=http://www.world-nuclear.org/info/inf79.html|publisher=World Nuclear Association|accessdate=17 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nuclear power|Nuclear power energy]] was a national strategic priority in Japan.
As of May 2018, there are 42 operable reactors in Japan. 
Of these, 8 reactors in 5 power plants are operating.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nuclear Power in Japan {{!}} Japanese Nuclear Energy - World Nuclear Association|url=http://world-nuclear.org/information-library/country-profiles/countries-g-n/japan-nuclear-power.aspx|website=world-nuclear.org|accessdate=1 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=oi4/&gt;

Though all of Japan's nuclear reactors successfully withstood shaking from the [[Tohoku region|Tohoku]] [[earthquake]], [[Flood|flooding]] from the ensuing [[tsunami]] caused the failure of cooling systems at the [[Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster|Fukushima I Nuclear Power Plant]] on 11 March 2011. 
Japan's first-ever nuclear emergency was declared, and 140,000 residents within {{convert|20|km|mi|abbr=on}} of the plant were evacuated. 
A comprehensive assessment by international experts on the health risks associated with the Fukushima I nuclear power plant disaster concluded in 2013 that, for the general population inside and outside Japan, the predicted risks were low and no observable increases in cancer rates above baseline rates were anticipated.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/releases/2013/fukushima_report_20130228/en/ Global report on Fukushima nuclear accident details health risks] [[World Health Organization]], news release 2013-02-28, accessed 2013-07-04&lt;/ref&gt; 
All Japan's nuclear plants were closed, or their operations suspended for safety inspections. The last of Japan's fifty reactors ([[Tomari Nuclear Power Plant#Reactors on site|Tomari-3]]) went offline for maintenance on 5 May 2012,&lt;ref name=Guardian&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/may/05/japan-shuts-down-last-nuclear-reactor |title=Japan shuts down last working nuclear reactor |author=David Batty |date= May 5, 2012 |work=The Guardian }}&lt;/ref&gt; leaving Japan completely without nuclear-produced electrical power for the first time since 1970.

Problems in stabilizing the triple reactor meltdowns at Fukushima I nuclear plant hardened attitudes to nuclear power. 
In June 2011, more than 80 percent of Japanese said they were [[anti-nuclear]] and distrusted government information on [[radiation]].&lt;ref name=refuse2011&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Asia-Pacific/2011/0620/Beginning-of-the-end-for-nuclear-power-in-Japan |title=Beginning of the end for nuclear power in Japan? |author1=Gavin Blair |date=June 20, 2011 |work=CSMonitor }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="M.

===Early years===
====Overcoming popular resistance====
In 1954, the [[Operations Coordinating Board]] of the [[United States National Security Council]] proposed that the U.S. government undertake a "vigorous offensive" urging nuclear energy for Japan in order to overcome the widespread reluctance of the Japanese population to build nuclear reactors in the country. Thirty two million Japanese people, a third of the Japanese population, signed a petition calling for banning [[hydrogen bomb]]s.&lt;ref&gt;John Swenson-Wright, "Unequal Allies: United States Security and Alliance Policy Toward Japan, 1945-1960 (Stanford, CA: Stanford University Press, 2005), p. 181&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Washington Post]] called for adopting the proposal to build nuclear reactors in Japan, stating: "Many Americans are now aware...that the dropping of the atomic bombs on Japan was not necessary....How better to make a contribution to amends than by offering Japan...atomic energy."&lt;ref name=WaPo1954&gt;Washington Post, 23 Sept. 1954, p. 18, "A Reactor for Japan"&lt;/ref&gt; For several years starting in 1954, the [[United States Central Intelligence Agency]] and other U.S. government agencies ran a propaganda war targeting the Japanese population to vanquish the Japanese people's opposition to nuclear power.&lt;ref&gt;[[New York Times]], 8 June 1956, "Tokyo Press Stirs Ire of Americans"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=WaPo1954/&gt;{{failed verification|date=November 2018}}

In 1954, Japan budgeted 230 million yen for nuclear energy, marking the beginning of the Japan's nuclear program. The [[Atomic Energy Basic Law]] limited activities to only peaceful purposes.&lt;ref&gt;Johnston, Eric, "[http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20110716f1.html Key players got nuclear ball rolling]", ''[[Japan Times]]'', 16 July 2011, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Tōkai Nuclear Power Plant|first nuclear reactor in Japan]] was built by the [[United Kingdom|UK]]'s [[General Electric Company plc|GEC]] and was commissioned in 1966.

====Light water reactors====
In the 1970s, the first [[light water reactor]]s were built in cooperation with American companies. These plants were bought from U.S. vendors such as [[General Electric]] and [[Westinghouse Electric Company|Westinghouse]] with contractual work done by Japanese companies, who would later get a license themselves to build similar plant designs. Developments in nuclear power since that time have seen contributions from Japanese companies and research institutes on the same level as the other big users of nuclear power. From the early 1970s to the present, the Japanese government promoted the siting of nuclear power plants through a variety of policy instruments involving soft social control and financial incentives.&lt;ref&gt;[[Daniel P. Aldrich]] 'How the Japanese Government Manipulated Public Opinion'[https://newrepublic.com/article/world/85463/japan-nuclear-power-regulation]&lt;/ref&gt; By offering large subsidies and public works projects to rural communities and by using educational trips, junkets for local government officials, and OpEds written as news by pro-nuclear supporters, the central government won over the support of depopulating, hard-on-their-luck coastal towns and villages.

===Later years===

Japan's nuclear industry was not hit as hard by the effects of the [[Three Mile Island accident]] (TMI) or the [[Chernobyl disaster]] as some other countries. 
Construction of new plants continued to be strong through the 1980s, 1990s, and up to the present day. 
While many new plants had been proposed, all were subsequently canceled or never brought past initial planning. 
Cancelled plant orders include:
* The [[Hōhoku Nuclear Power Plant]] at [[Hōhoku, Yamaguchi]]—1994
* The [[Kushima Nuclear Power Plant]] at [[Kushima, Miyazaki]]—1997
* The [[Ashihama Nuclear Power Plant]] at [[Ashihama, Mie]]—2000 (the first Project at the site in the 1970s was completed at Hamaoka as Unit 1&amp;2)
* The [[Maki Nuclear Power Plant]] at [[Maki, Niigata (Kambara)]]—Canceled in 2003
* The [[Suzu Nuclear Power Plant]] at [[Suzu, Ishikawa]]—2003

However, starting in the mid-1990s there were several nuclear related accidents and cover-ups in Japan that eroded public perception of the industry, resulting in protests and resistance to new plants. 
These accidents included the [[Tokaimura nuclear accident]], the [[Mihama Nuclear Power Plant|Mihama steam explosion]], cover-ups after an accident at the [[Monju Nuclear Power Plant|Monju reactor]], among others, more recently the [[2007 Chūetsu offshore earthquake|Chūetsu offshore earthquake]] aftermath. 
While exact details may be in dispute, it is clear that the safety culture in Japan's nuclear industry has come under greater scrutiny.&lt;ref name="Japan cancels nuclear plant"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/652169.stm | work=BBC News | title=Japan cancels nuclear plant | date=February 22, 2000}} [The news fails to note that the Tokaimura accident did not happen in a power plant.]&lt;/ref&gt;

===2000s===

On April 18, 2007, Japan and the United States signed the [[United States-Japan Joint Nuclear Energy Action Plan]], aimed at putting in place a framework for the joint research and development of nuclear energy technology.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.energy.gov/news/4991.htm United States and Japan Sign Joint Nuclear Energy Action Plan] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090720060428/http://www.energy.gov/news/4991.htm |date=2009-07-20 }}, ''[[United States Department of Energy]]'', published 2007-04-25, accessed 2007-05-02&lt;/ref&gt; 
Each country will conduct research into [[fast reactor]] technology, fuel cycle technology, advanced computer simulation and modeling, small and medium reactors, safeguards and physical protection; and [[nuclear waste]] management.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.energy.gov/media/USJapanFactSheet.pdf Fact Sheet: United States-Japan Joint Nuclear Energy Action Plan] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110521144837/http://www.energy.gov/media/USJapanFactSheet.pdf |date=2011-05-21 }}, ''[[United States Department of Energy]]'', published 2007-04-25, accessed 2007-05-02&lt;/ref&gt; 
In March 2008, [[Tokyo Electric Power Company]] announced that the start of operation of four new nuclear power reactors would be postponed by one year due to the incorporation of new earthquake resistance assessments. 
Units 7 and 8 of the Fukushima Daiichi plant would now enter commercial operation in October 2014 and October 2015, respectively. 
Unit 1 of the Higashidori plant is now scheduled to begin operating in December 2015, while unit 2 will start up in 2018 at the earliest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.world-nuclear-news.org/NN-New_Japanese_nuclear_power_reactors_delayed-260308.html |title=New Japanese nuclear power reactors delayed |publisher=World-nuclear-news.org |date=2008-03-26 |accessdate=2013-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
As of September 2008, Japanese ministries and agencies were seeking an increase in the 2009 budget by 6%. 
The total requested comes to 491.4 billion [[Japanese yen]] (4.6 billion USD), and the focuses of research are development of the fast breeder reactor cycle, next-generation light water reactors, the [[Iter]] project, and seismic safety.&lt;ref&gt;NucNet.

===Fukushima disaster and aftermath===

{{expand section|date=May 2017}}

A 2011 independent investigation in Japan has "revealed a long history of nuclear power companies conspiring with governments to manipulate public opinion in favour of nuclear energy". One nuclear company "even stacked public meetings with its own employees who posed as ordinary citizens to speak in support of nuclear power plants".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2011-10-03/japan-nuclear-companies-stacked-public-meetings/3206288/?site=melbourne |title=Japan nuke companies stacked public meetings |author=Mark Willacy |date= October 3, 2011 |work=ABC News }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
An energy white paper, approved by the Japanese Cabinet in October 2011, says "public confidence in safety of nuclear power was greatly damaged" by the Fukushima disaster, and calls for a reduction in the nation’s reliance on nuclear power. 
It also omits a section on nuclear power expansion that was in last year’s policy review.&lt;ref name="Tsuyoshi Inajima and Yuji Okada"/&gt; 
Nuclear Safety Commission Chairman Haruki Madarame told a parliamentary inquiry in February 2012 that "Japan's atomic safety rules are inferior to global standards and left the country unprepared for the Fukushima nuclear disaster last March". 
There were flaws in, and lax enforcement of, the safety rules governing Japanese nuclear power companies, and this included insufficient protection against tsunamis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.businessweek.com/article.asp?documentKey=1376-LZF0E16JTSEY01-3P322MREJS02KO2666B7QSBOV9 |title=Nuclear Safety Chief Says Lax Rules Led to Fukushima Crisis |date=16 February 2012 |work=Bloomberg }}{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Government figures in the 2014 Annual Report on Energy show that Japan depended on imported fossil fuels for 88% of its electricity in fiscal year 2013, compared with 62% in fiscal 2010. Without significant nuclear power, the country was self-sufficient for just 6% of its energy demand in 2012, compared with 20% in 2010. 
The additional fuel costs to compensate for its nuclear reactors being idled was ¥3.6 trillion. 
In parallel, domestic energy users have seen a 19.4% increase in their energy bills between 2010 and 2013, while industrial users have seen their costs rise 28.4% over the same period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.world-nuclear-news.org/NP-Japan-continues-to-count-cost-of-idled-reactors-1706144.html/| title=Japan continues to count cost of idled reactors |publisher=[[World Nuclear News]] |date=June 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018 the Japanese government revised its energy plan to update the 2030 target for nuclear energy to 20%-22% of power generation by restarting reactors, compared to LNG 27%, coal 25%, renewables 23% and oil 3%.  This would reduce Japan's carbon dioxide emissions by 26% compared to 2013, and increase self-sufficiency to about 24% by 2030, compared to 8% in 2016.&lt;ref name=wnn-20180703&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.world-nuclear-news.org/NP-Japanese-Cabinet-approves-new-basic-energy-plan-0307184.html |title=Japanese Cabinet approves new basic energy plan |publisher=World Nuclear News |date=3 July 2018 |accessdate=9 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Investigations on the Fukushima disaster====

The [[National Diet of Japan Fukushima Nuclear Accident Independent Investigation Commission]] (NAIIC) is the first independent investigation commission by the [[Diet of Japan|National Diet]] in the 66-year history of Japan’s constitutional government. 
NAICC was established on December 8, 2011 with the mission to investigate the direct and indirect causes of the Fukushima nuclear accident.

It was a six-month independent investigation, the first of its kind with wide-ranging subpoena powers in Japan's constitutional history, which held public hearings with former Prime Minister [[Naoto Kan]] and [[Tokyo Electric Power Company|Tokyo Electric Power Co]]'s former president [[Masataka Shimizu]], who gave conflicting accounts of the disaster response.&lt;ref name="Bloomberg20120705"&gt;{{cite web|title=Fukushima nuclear accident 'man-made', not natural disaster|url=http://www.smh.com.au/world/fukushima-nuclear-accident--manmade-not-natural--disaster-20120705-21jrl.html|work=Bloomberg|publisher=The Sydney Morning Herald|accessdate=9 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The commission chairman, Kiyoshi Kurokawa, declared with respect to the Fukushima nuclear incident: “It was a profoundly man-made disaster — that could and should have been foreseen and prevented.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Japan’s nuclear meltdown could have been prevented|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/japans-nuclear-meltdown-could-have-been-prevented/2012/07/05/gJQAf9nPQW_story.html|accessdate=9 July 2012|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=6 July 2012|author=Editorial Board}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The report outlines errors and willful negligence at the plant before the [[2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami]] on March 11, 2011 and a flawed response in the hours, days and weeks that followed. It also offers recommendations and encourages Japan's parliament to "thoroughly debate and deliberate" the suggestions.&lt;ref name="CNN20120705"&gt;{{cite web|title=Japanese parliament report: Fukushima nuclear crisis was 'man-made'|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2012/07/05/world/asia/japan-fukushima-report/index.html|publisher=CNN|accessdate=9 July 2012|author1=Yoko Wakatsuki  |author2=Jethro Mullen |lastauthoramp=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2015 courts blocked the restarting of two reactors at [[Takahama Nuclear Power Plant]] but permitted the restart of two reactors at [[Sendai Nuclear Power Plant]].&lt;ref name=economist-20150425&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.economist.com/news/asia/21649557-court-cases-frustrate-efforts-restart-japans-nuclear-plants-legal-fallout |title=Nuclear power in Japan - Legal fallout |newspaper=The Economist |date=25 April 2015 |accessdate=3 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The government hopes that nuclear power will produce 20% of Japan’s electricity by 2030.&lt;ref name=economist-20150425/&gt;

As of June 2015, approval was being sought from the new Nuclear Regulatory Agency for 24 units to restart, of the 54 pre-Fukushima units. 
The units also have to be approved by the local prefecture authorities before restarting.&lt;ref name=nei-20150624&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.neimagazine.com/opinion/opinionjapan-what-is-the-future-for-nuclear-power-4608426/ |title=Japan - what is the future for nuclear power? |author=Steve Kidd |publisher=Nuclear Engineering International |date=24 June 2015 |accessdate=11 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2015 fuel loading was completed at the [[Sendai Nuclear Power Plant|Sendai-1]] nuclear plant, it restarted August 11, 2015 and was followed by unit 2 on November 1, 2015. Japan’s Nuclear Regulatory Authority approved the restart of [[Ikata Nuclear Power Plant|Ikata-3]] which took place on April 19, 2016, this reactor is the fifth to receive approval to restart.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nei.org/News-Media/News/Japan-Nuclear-Update&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Takahama Nuclear Power Plant]] unit 4 restarted in May 2017 and unit 3 in June 2017.

In November 2016 Japan signed a nuclear cooperation agreement [[Nuclear power in India|with India]]. 
Japanese nuclear plant builders saw this as potential lifeline given that domestic orders had ended following the Fukushima disaster, and India is proposing to build about 20 new reactors over the next decade. However, there is Japanese domestic opposition to the agreement, as India has not agreed to the [[Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons]].&lt;ref name=jt-20161111&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/12/business/international/japan-india-nuclear-deal.html |title=Japan's Nuclear Industry Finds a Lifeline in India After Foundering Elsewhere |author=Jonathan Soble |newspaper=The Japan Times |date=11 November 2016 |accessdate=17 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Seismicity==
Japan has had a long [[Seismicity in Japan|history of earthquakes and seismic activity]], and destructive [[earthquake]]s, often resulting in [[tsunami]]s, occur several times a century. Due to this, concern has been expressed about the particular risks of constructing and operating nuclear power plants in Japan. [[Amory Lovins]] has said: "An earthquake-and-tsunami zone crowded with 127 million people is an un-wise place for 54 reactors".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/amory-lovins/nuclear-power-fukushima-_b_837643.html |title=With Nuclear Power, "No Acts of God Can Be Permitted" |author=Amory Lovins |date=March 18, 2011 |work=Huffington Post }}&lt;/ref&gt; To date, the most serious seismic-related accident has been the [[Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster]], following the [[2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami]].

Professor [[Katsuhiko Ishibashi]], one of the [[Seismology|seismologists]] who have taken an active interest in the topic, coined the term ''[[genpatsu-shinsai]]'' (原発震災), from the Japanese words for "nuclear power" and "quake disaster" to express the potential worst-case catastrophe that could ensue.&lt;ref name=why-worry&gt;Katsuhiko Ishibashi, [http://www.japanfocus.org/-Ishibashi-Katsuhiko/2495 "Why worry?

Warnings from Kunihiko Shimazaki, a professor of seismology at the University of Tokyo, were also ignored. In 2004, as a member of an influential cabinet office committee on offshore earthquakes, Mr. Shimazaki "warned that Fukushima's coast was vulnerable to tsunamis more than twice as tall as the forecasts of as much as five meters put forth by regulators and Tokyo Electric".&lt;ref name=jap12/&gt; Minutes of the meeting on Feb. 19, 2004, show that the government bureaucrats running the committee moved quickly to exclude his views from the committee's final report.

[[Hidekatsu Yoshii]], a member of the [[House of Representatives of Japan|House of Representatives]] for [[Japanese Communist Party]] and an [[Anti-nuclear movement|anti-nuclear campaigner]], warned in March and October 2006 about the possibility of the severe damage that might be caused by a tsunami or earthquake.&lt;ref name=wsj-11-03-28&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703576204576226530875684182|title=Lawmaker Broached Plant Risk|author1=Dvorak, Phred |author2=Hayashi, Yuka |publisher=The Wall Street Journal|date=March 28, 2011|accessdate=March 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; During a parliamentary committee in May 2010 he made similar claims, warning that the cooling systems of a Japanese nuclear plant could be destroyed by a landslide or earthquake.&lt;ref name=wsj-11-03-28 /&gt; In response [[Yoshinobu Terasaka]], head of the [[Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency]], replied that the plants were so well designed that "such a situation is practically impossible".&lt;ref name=wsj-11-03-28 /&gt; Following damage at the [[Kashiwazaki-Kariwa Nuclear Power Plant]] due to the [[2007 Chūetsu offshore earthquake]], Kiyoo Mogi called for the immediate closure of the [[Hamaoka Nuclear Power Plant]],&lt;ref name="nature-07-07-25"/&gt;&lt;ref name=times-07-07-19&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/asia/article2096238.ece Nuclear crisis in Japan as scientists reveal quake threat to power plants] The Times, published 2007-07-19, accessed 2011-03-18&lt;/ref&gt; which was knowingly built close to the centre of the expected [[Tokai earthquakes|Tōkai earthquake]].&lt;ref name=mogi-2004 /&gt; Katsuhiko Ishibashi previously claimed, in 2004, that Hamaoka was "considered to be the most dangerous nuclear power plant in Japan".&lt;ref name=japantimes-04-05-23&gt;[http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/fl20040523x2.html Japan's deadly game of nuclear roulette] The Japan Times, published 2004-05-23, accessed 2011-03-18&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[International Atomic Energy Agency]] (IAEA) has also expressed concern. At a meeting of the [[G8|G8's]] Nuclear Safety and Security Group, held in Tokyo in 2008, an IAEA expert warned that a strong [[earthquake]] with a [[Richter magnitude scale#Richter magnitudes|magnitude]] above {{nowrap|7.0}} could pose a 'serious problem' for Japan's nuclear power stations.&lt;ref name=wl&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.physorg.com/news/2011-03-iaea-japan-nuclear-quake-wikileaks.html |title=IAEA warned Japan over nuclear quake risk: WikiLeaks |publisher=physorg.com |date= |accessdate=2013-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before Fukushima, "14 lawsuits charging that risks had been ignored or hidden were filed in Japan, revealing a disturbing pattern in which operators underestimated or hid seismic dangers to avoid costly upgrades and keep operating.

=== Design standards ===
[[Image:Japan Nuclear Earthquake Shaking.PNG|thumb|350px|Horizontal acceleration experienced and design values during the 2007 and 2011 major earthquake and earthquake-tsunami events.]]
Between 2005 and 2007, three Japanese nuclear power plants were shaken by earthquakes that far exceeded the maximum [[peak ground acceleration]] used in their design.&lt;ref name=autralian-11-03-13&gt;[http://www.theaustralian.com.au/japans-nuclear-plant-quake-protection-too-lax-said-expert/story-fn84naht-1226020553408 Japan's nuclear plant quake protection too lax, said expert] [[The Australian]] published 2011-03-13, accessed 2011-04-06&lt;/ref&gt; The [[tsunami]] that followed the [[2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami|2011 Tōhoku earthquake]], inundating the [[Fukushima I nuclear accidents|Fukushima I Nuclear Power Plant]], was more than twice the design height,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.world-nuclear-news.org/RS_Fukushima_faced_14-metre_tsunami_2303113.html |title=Fukushima faced 14-metre tsunami |date=23 March 2011|publisher=World Nuclear News |accessdate=March 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the ground acceleration also slightly exceeded the design parameters.&lt;ref&gt;[http://neutroneconomy.blogspot.com/2011/04/japans-earthquake-regulations.html Japan's Earthquake Regulations for Nuclear Power] ''The Neutron Economy'' published 2011-04-04, accessed 2011-04-06&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006 a Japanese government subcommittee&lt;!-- probably the Subcommittee on Safety Examination Guidelines for Seismic Design--&gt; was charged with revising the national guidelines on the earthquake-resistance of nuclear power plants, which had last been partially revised in 2001,&lt;ref name=2006-seismic-guide&gt;[http://www.nsc.go.jp/english/taishin.pdf Regulatory Guide for Reviewing Seismic Design of Nuclear Power Reactor Facilities] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721224251/http://www.nsc.go.jp/english/taishin.pdf |date=2011-07-21 }} [[Japanese Nuclear Safety Commission|Nuclear Safety Commission]], published 2006-09-19, accessed 2011-04-06&lt;/ref&gt; resulting in the publication of a new seismic guide — the 2006 ''Regulatory Guide for Reviewing Seismic Design of Nuclear Power Reactor Facilities''.&lt;ref name=2006-seismic-guide /&gt; The subcommittee membership included Professor Ishibashi, however his proposal that the standards for surveying active [[Fault (geology)|faults]] should be reviewed was rejected and he resigned at the final meeting, claiming that the review process was 'unscientific'&lt;ref name="nature-07-07-25"/&gt;&lt;ref name=businessweek-11-03-11&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.businessweek.com/news/2011-03-17/japan-nuclear-disaster-caps-decades-of-faked-reports-accidents.html |title=Japan Nuclear Disaster Caps Decades of Faked Reports, Accidents |author=Jason Clenfield |date=March 17, 2011 |work=Bloomberg Businessweek }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the outcome rigged&lt;ref name=businessweek-11-03-11 /&gt;&lt;ref name=bloomberg-07-12-12&gt;[https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&amp;sid=awR8KsLlAcSo Japan Nuclear Energy Drive Compromised by Conflicts of Interest] [[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]], published 2007-12-12, accessed 2011-04-11&lt;/ref&gt; to suit the interests of the [[Japan Electric Association]], which had 11 of its committee members on the 19-member government subcommittee.&lt;ref name=bloomberg-07-12-12 /&gt; Ishibashi has subsequently claimed that, although the new guide brought in the most far-reaching changes since 1978, it was 'seriously flawed' because it underestimated the [[Peak ground acceleration|design basis earthquake ground motion]].&lt;ref name=why-worry /&gt; He has also claimed that the enforcement system is 'a shambles'&lt;ref name=why-worry /&gt;&lt;ref name=autralian-11-03-13 /&gt; and questioned the independence of the [[Japanese Nuclear Safety Commission|Nuclear Safety Commission]] after a senior Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency official appeared to rule out a new review of the NSC's seismic design guide in 2007.&lt;ref name=why-worry /&gt;

=== Geological surveys ===
The standard of geological survey work in Japan is another area causing concern. In 2008 Taku Komatsubara, a [[Geology|geologist]] at the [[National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology]] alleged that the presence of active [[Fault (geology)|faults]] was deliberately ignored when surveys of potential new power plant sites were undertaken, a view supported by a former [[topography|topographer]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.upiasia.com/Security/2008/06/12/japans_nuclear_facilities_face_quake_risk/3945/ Japan's nuclear facilities face quake risk] UPI Asia, published 2008-06-12, accessed 2011-04-11&lt;/ref&gt; Takashi Nakata, a seismologist from the [[Hiroshima Institute of Technology]] has made similar allegations, and suggest that conflicts of interest between the Japanese nuclear industry and the regulators contribute to the problem.&lt;ref name=bloomberg-07-12-12 /&gt;

A 2011 [[Natural Resources Defense Council]] report that evaluated the seismic hazard to reactors worldwide, as determined by the Global Seismic Hazard Assessment Program data, placed 35 of Japan's reactors in the group of 48 reactors worldwide in very high and high seismic hazard areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://docs.nrdc.org/nuclear/files/nuc_11102801a.pdf |title=Global Implications of the Fukushima Disaster for Nuclear Power |author1=Thomas B.

== Nuclear accidents ==
{{see also|List of Japanese nuclear incidents}}
In terms of consequences of radioactivity releases and core damage the [[Fukushima I nuclear accidents]] in 2011 were the worst experienced by the Japanese nuclear industry, in addition to ranking among the worst [[List of civilian nuclear accidents|civilian nuclear accidents]], though no fatalities were caused and no serious exposure of radiation to workers occurred. 
The [[Tokaimura]] reprocessing plant fire in 1999 had 2 worker deaths, one more exposed to radiation levels above legal limits and over 660 others received detectable radiation doses but within permissible levels, well below the threshold to affect human health. The [[Mihama Nuclear Power Plant]] experienced a steam explosion in one of the turbine buildings in 2004 where five workers were killed and six injured.&lt;ref name=KEPCO-20070207&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kepco.co.jp/english/notice/070207.html |title=Restarting Commercial Operation of Mihama Nuclear Power Plant Unit 3 |publisher=KEPCO |date=7 February 2007 |accessdate=16 April 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140416183322/http://www.kepco.co.jp/english/notice/070207.html |archivedate=16 April 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
On March 24, 2011, Japanese officials announced that "radioactive iodine-131 exceeding safety limits for infants had been detected at 18 water-purification plants in Tokyo and five other prefectures". Officials said also that the fallout from the Dai-ichi plant is "hindering search efforts for victims from the March 11 earthquake and tsunami".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://content.usatoday.com/communities/ondeadline/post/2011/03/report-radioactive-emissions-from-japan-plant-approach-chernobyl-levels/1 |title=Report: Emissions from Japan plant approach Chernobyl levels |author=Michael Winter |date=March 24, 2011 |work=USA Today |page= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Problems in stabilizing the [[Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant]] have hardened attitudes to [[nuclear power]]. As of June 2011, "more than 80 percent of Japanese now say they are [[anti-nuclear]] and distrust government information on [[radiation]]".&lt;ref name=refuse2011/&gt; The ongoing Fukushima crisis may spell the end of nuclear power in Japan, as "citizen opposition grows and local authorities refuse permission to restart reactors that have undergone safety checks". Local authorities are skeptical that sufficient safety measures have been taken and are reticent to give their permission – now required by law – to bring suspended nuclear reactors back online.&lt;ref name="refuse2011"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Johnston, Eric, "[http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20110922x3.html Current nuclear debate to set nation's course for decades]", ''[[Japan Times]]'', 23 September 2011, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

Two government advisers have said that "Japan's safety review of nuclear reactors after the Fukushima disaster is based on faulty criteria and many people involved have conflicts of interest". [[Hiromitsu Ino]], Professor Emeritus at the University of Tokyo, says
"The whole process being undertaken is exactly the same as that used previous to the Fukushima Dai-Ichi accident, even though the accident showed all these guidelines and categories to be insufficient".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.businessweek.com/article.asp?documentKey=1376-LYG9UU6K50XS01-1T2KDJMKSDHCGQ4C640BU0QC83 |title=Japan Post-Fukushima Reactor Checks ‘Insufficient,' Advisers Say |date=January 27, 2012 |work=Businessweek |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120214001411/http://news.businessweek.com/article.asp?documentKey=1376-LYG9UU6K50XS01-1T2KDJMKSDHCGQ4C640BU0QC83 |archivedate=February 14, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, former prime minister [[Naoto Kan]] was interviewed about the Fukushima nuclear disaster, and has said that at one point Japan faced a situation where there was a chance that people might not be able to live in the capital zone including Tokyo and would have to evacuate. He says he is haunted by the specter of an even bigger nuclear crisis forcing tens of millions of people to flee Tokyo and threatening the nation's existence. "If things had reached that level, not only would the public have had to face hardships but Japan's very existence would have been in peril".&lt;ref name=k12/&gt; That convinced Kan to "declare the need for Japan to end its reliance on atomic power and promote renewable sources of energy such solar that have long taken a back seat in the resource-poor country's energy mix".&lt;ref name=k12&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/02/17/us-japan-kan-idUSTRE81G08P20120217 |title=Nuclear crisis turns Japan ex-PM Kan into energy apostle |author1=Linda Sieg  |author2=Yoko Kubota  |lastauthoramp=yes |date=Feb 17, 2012 |work=Reuters }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* 2000: Three TEPCO executives were forced to quit after the company in 1989 ordered an employee to edit out footage showing cracks in nuclear plant steam pipes in video being submitted to regulators.&lt;ref name=alook/&gt;
* August 2002: a widespread falsification scandal starting in that led to the shut down of all [[Tokyo Electric Power Company]]’s 17 nuclear reactors; Tokyo Electric's officials had falsified inspection records and attempted to hide cracks in [[core shroud|reactor vessel shrouds]] in 13 of its 17 units.&lt;ref name="mycle"/&gt;

* 2006: A small amount of radioactive steam was released at the Fukushima Dai-ichi plant and it escaped the compound.&lt;ref name=alook/&gt;
* 16 July 2007: A [[2007 Chūetsu offshore earthquake|severe earthquake]] (measuring 6.6 on the moment magnitude scale) hit the region where Tokyo Electric's [[Kashiwazaki-Kariwa Nuclear Power Plant]] is located and radioactive water spilled into the Sea of Japan; as of March 2009, all of the reactors remain shut down for damage verification and repairs; the plant with seven units was the largest single nuclear power station in the world.&lt;ref name=mycle/&gt;

== Nuclear waste disposal ==
Japanese policy is to [[Nuclear reprocessing|reprocess its spent nuclear fuel]]. Originally spent fuel was reprocessed under contract in England and France, but then the [[Rokkasho Reprocessing Plant]] was built, with operations originally expected to commence in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Japan Nuclear Fuel Limited |title=Operational progress |date=2006-03-31 |url=http://www.jnfl.co.jp/english/progress.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080526080731/http://www.jnfl.co.jp/english/progress.html | archivedate=2008-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The policy to use recovered plutonium as mixed oxide ([[MOX]]) reactor fuel was questioned on economic grounds, and in 2004 it was revealed the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry had covered up a 1994 report indicating reprocessing spent fuel would cost four times as much as burying it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Bursting point |date=2004-08-14 |journal=Economist |page=55}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, a Specified Radioactive Waste Final Disposal Act called for creation of a new organization to [[High-level radioactive waste management|manage high level radioactive waste]], and later that year the Nuclear Waste Management Organization of Japan (NUMO) was established under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry. NUMO is responsible for selecting a permanent [[deep geological repository]] site, construction, operation and closure of the facility for waste emplacement by 2040.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |date=May–June 2001 |title=Japan's nuclear twilight zone |journal=Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists |issue=57 |page=58 |author1=Burnie, Shaun |author2=Smith, Aileen Mioko}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Nuclear Waste Management Organization of Japan |year=2002 |title=Open solicitation for candidate sites for safe disposal of high-level radioactive waste |location=Tokyo |url=http://www.numo.or.jp}}&lt;/ref&gt; Site selection began in 2002 and application information was sent to 3,239 municipalities, but by 2006, no local government had volunteered to host the facility.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Vandenbosch|2007|p=240.|Ref=none}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kōchi Prefecture]] showed interest in 2007, but its mayor resigned due to local opposition. In December 2013 the government decided to identify suitable candidate areas before approaching municipalities.&lt;ref name=jt-20140121&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/opinion/2014/01/21/editorials/japans-nuclear-waste-problem/ |title=Japan's nuclear waste problem |newspaper=The Japan Times |date=21 January 2014 |accessdate=23 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014 the head of the [[Science Council of Japan]]’s expert panel has said Japan's seismic conditions makes it difficult to predict ground conditions over the necessary 100,000 years, so it will be impossible to convince the public of the safety of deep geological disposal.&lt;ref name=jt-20140121/&gt;

The cost of MOX fuel had roughly quadrupled from 1999 to 2017, creating doubts about the economics of nuclear fuel reprocessing.&lt;ref name=jt-20171219&gt;{{cite news |url=https://japantoday.com/category/business/japan-power-companies-face-surging-nuclear-fuel-recycling-costs |title=Japanese power companies face surging nuclear fuel recycling costs |newspaper=The Japan Times |date=19 December 2017 |accessdate=19 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2018 the [[Japanese Atomic Energy Commission]] updated plutonium guidelines to try to reduce plutonium stockpiles, stipulating that the [[Rokkasho Reprocessing Plant]] should only produce the amount of plutonium required for MOX fuel for Japan’s nuclear power plants.&lt;ref name=nei-20180802&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.neimagazine.com/news/newsjapan-revises-plutonium-guidelines-6284647 |title=Japan revises plutonium guidelines |publisher=Nuclear Engineering International |date=2 August 2018 |accessdate=2 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Nuclear regulatory bodies in Japan ==
* [[Nuclear Regulation Authority]] – A nuclear safety agency under the environment ministry, created on September 19, 2012. It replaced the Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency and the Nuclear Safety Commission.
* [[Japanese Atomic Energy Commission]] (AEC) 原子力委員会 – Now operating as a commission of inquiry to the Japanese cabinet, this organization coordinates the entire nation's plans in the area of nuclear energy.
* [[Japanese Nuclear Safety Commission|Nuclear Safety Commission]] 原子力安全委員会 – The former Japanese regulatory body for the nuclear industry.
* [[Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency]] (NISA) 原子力安全・保安院 – A former agency that performed regulatory activities and was formed on January 6, 2001, after a reorganization of governmental agencies.

== Nuclear power companies ==

=== Electric utilities running nuclear plants ===
Japan is divided into a number of regions that each get electric service from their respective regional provider, all utilities hold a monopoly and are strictly regulated by the Japanese government. For more background information, see [[Energy in Japan]]. All regional utilities in Japan currently operate nuclear plants with the exception of the [[Okinawa Electric Power Company]]. They are also all members of the [[Federation of Electric Power Companies]] (FEPCO) industry organization. The companies are listed below.
* '''Regional electric providers'''
:*[[Hokkaidō Electric Power Company]] (HEPCO) - 北海道電力

::This company was created by a special law after the end of World War II, it operates a number of coal fired, hydroelectric, and wind power plants, the Ohma nuclear plant that is under construction will mark its entrance to the industry upon completion.

=== Nuclear vendors and fuel cycle companies ===
Nuclear vendors provide fuel in its fabricated form, ready to be loaded in the reactor, nuclear services, and/or manage construction of new nuclear plants. The following is an incomplete list of companies based in Japan that provide such services. The companies listed here provide fuel or services for commercial light water plants, and in addition to this, JAEA has a small [[MOX fuel]] fabrication plant. Japan operates a robust [[nuclear fuel cycle]].&lt;ref&gt;Nagata, Kazuaki, "[http://www.japantimes.co.jp/text/nn20120918i1.html Vicious nuclear fuel cycle proving difficult to break]", ''[[Japan Times]]'', 18 September 2012, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Nuclear Fuel Industries]] (NFI) - 原子燃料工業 NFI operates nuclear fuel fabrication plants in both [[Kumatori, Osaka]] and in [[Tōkai, Ibaraki]], fabricating 284 and 200 (respectively) metric tons Uranium per year. The Tōkai site produces [[Boiling Water Reactor|BWR]], HTR, and ATR fuel while the Kumatori site produces only [[Pressurized Water Reactor|PWR]] fuel.
* [[Japan Nuclear Fuel Limited]] (JNFL, JNF) - 日本原燃 The shareholders of JNFL are the Japanese utilities. JNFL plans to open a full scale enrichment facility in [[Rokkasho, Aomori]] with a capacity of 1.5 million SWU/yr along with a MOX fuel fabrication facility. JNFL has also operated a nuclear fuel fabrication facility called Kurihama Nuclear Fuel Plant in [[Yokosuka, Kanagawa]] as GNF, producing BWR fuel.
* [[Mitsubishi Heavy Industries]] / [[Atmea]] - 三菱重工業 原子力事業本部 MHI operates a fuel manufacturing plant in [[Tōkai, Ibaraki]], and contributes many heavy industry components to construction of new nuclear plants, and has recently designed its own [[Advanced Pressurized Water Reactor|APWR]] plant type, fuel fabrication has been completely [[Pressurized Water Reactor|PWR]] fuel, though MHI sells components to BWRs as well. It was selected by the Japanese government to develop fast breeder reactor technology and formed [[Mitsubishi FBR Systems]]. MHI has also announced an alliance with [[Areva]] to form a new company called Atmea.
* [[Global Nuclear Fuel]] (GNF). GNF was formed as a joint venture with [[GE Nuclear Energy]] (GENE), [[Hitachi, Ltd.|Hitachi]], and [[Toshiba]] on January 1, 2000. GENE has since strengthened its relationship with Hitachi, forming a global nuclear alliance:
* [[GE Hitachi Nuclear Energy]] (GEH) - 日立GEニュークリア・エナジー This company was formed July 1, 2007. Its next generation reactor, the [[Economic Simplified Boiling Water Reactor|ESBWR]] has made significant progress with US regulators. Its predecessor design, the ABWR, has been approved by the UK regulator for construction in the UK, following successful completion of the generic design assessment (GDA) process in 2017.
* [[Toshiba]] - 東芝 電力システム社 原子力事業部 Toshiba has maintained a large nuclear business focused mostly on [[Boiling Water Reactors]]. With the purchase of the American [[Westinghouse Electric Company|Westinghouse]] by 5.4 Billion USD in 2006, which is focused mainly on [[Pressurized Water Reactor]] technology, it increased the size of its nuclear business about twofold. On 29 March 2017 Toshiba placed Westinghouse in [[Chapter 11 bankruptcy]] because of $9 billion of losses from its nuclear reactor construction projects, mostly the construction of four [[AP1000]] reactors in the U.S.&lt;ref name=reuters-20170324&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-toshiba-accounting-idUSKBN16V04G |title=Toshiba decides on Westinghouse bankruptcy, sees $9 billion in charges: sources |first=Taro |last=Fuse |publisher=Reuters |date=24 March 2017 |accessdate=25 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Toshiba still has a profitable maintenance and nuclear fuel supply business in Japan, and is a significant contractor in the Fukushima clean-up.&lt;ref name=reuters-20170331&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-toshiba-nuclear-idUSKBN17211S |title=Big in Japan?

* Recyclable-Fuel Storage Co. A company formed by [[TEPCO]] and Japan Atomic Power Co. to build a spent nuclear fuel storage facility in [[Aomori Prefecture]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Kyodo News]], "[http://www.japantimes.co.jp/text/nn20120317a5.html Work resumes on Aomori atomic fuel storage site]", ''[[Japan Times]]'', 17 March 2012, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been discussions between Hitachi, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries and Toshiba about possibly consolidating some of their nuclear activities.&lt;ref name=reuters-20170331/&gt;

== Nuclear Research and professional organizations in Japan ==

=== Research organizations ===
These organizations are government-funded research organizations, though many of them have special status to give them power of administration separate from the Japanese government. Their origins date back to the [[Atomic Energy Basic Law]], but they have been reorganized several times since their inception.
* [[Japan Atomic Energy Research Institute]] (JAERI) - 日本原子力研究所  The original nuclear energy research organization established by the Japanese government under cooperation with U.S. partners.
* [[Atomic Fuel Corporation]] - 原子燃料公社  This organization was formed along with JAERI under the Atomic Energy Basic Law and was later reorganized to be PNC.
* [[Power Reactor and Nuclear Fuel Development Corporation]] (PNC) - Succeeded the AFC in 1967 in order to perform more direct construction of experimental nuclear plants, and was renamed JNC in 1998.
* [[Japan Nuclear Cycle Development Institute]] (JNC) - 核燃料サイクル開発機構 (semi-governmental agency) Was formed in 1998 as the direct successor to the PNC. This organization operated Lojo and [[Monju Nuclear Power Plant|Monju]] experimental and demonstration reactors.

[[File:VOA Herman - 2011-04-16 anti-nuclear protests in Tokyo.jpg|thumb|Peaceful anti-nuclear protest in Tokyo, Japan, escorted by policemen, 16 April 2011.]]

Long one of the world’s most committed promoters of civilian [[nuclear power]], Japan's nuclear industry was not hit as hard by the effects of the 1979 [[Three Mile Island accident]] (USA) or the 1986 [[Chernobyl disaster]] (USSR) as some other countries.  Construction of new plants continued to be strong through the 1980s and into the 1990s.  However, starting in the mid-1990s there were several nuclear related accidents and cover-ups in Japan that eroded public perception of the industry, resulting in protests and resistance to new plants.  These accidents included the [[Tokaimura nuclear accident]], the [[Mihama Nuclear Power Plant|Mihama steam explosion]], cover-ups after accidents at the [[Monju Nuclear Power Plant|Monju reactor]], and more recently the [[Kashiwazaki-Kariwa Nuclear Power Plant]] was completely shut down for 21 months following an earthquake in 2007.  While exact details may be in dispute, it is clear that the safety culture in Japan's nuclear industry has come under greater scrutiny.&lt;ref name="Japan cancels nuclear plant"/&gt;

The negative impact of the 2011 [[Fukushima nuclear disaster]] has changed attitudes in Japan. Political and energy experts describe "nothing short of a nationwide loss of faith, not only in Japan’s once-vaunted nuclear technology but also in the government, which many blame for allowing the accident to happen".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/09/world/asia/japan-shutting-down-its-nuclear-power-industry.html?ref=energyandpower |title=Japan’s Nuclear Energy Industry Nears Shutdown, at Least for Now |author=Martin Fackler |date=March 8, 2012  |work=New York Times }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sixty thousand people marched in central Tokyo on 19 September 2011, chanting "Sayonara nuclear power" and waving banners, to call on Japan's government to abandon nuclear power, following the Fukushima disaster.&lt;ref name="usatoday.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name=wompro/&gt; Bishop of Osaka, Michael Goro Matsuura, has called on the solidarity of Christians worldwide to support this anti-nuclear campaign.&lt;ref name="Sean McDonagh"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/opinion/2012/0306/1224312849774.html |title=After Fukushima, Vatican joins growing army of opponents of nuclear power |author=Sean McDonagh |date=March 6, 2012 |work=The Irish Times  }}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2012, 75,000 people gathered near in Tokyo for the capital’s largest anti-nuclear event. Organizers and participants said such demonstrations signal a fundamental change in attitudes in a nation where relatively few have been willing to engage in political protests since the 1960s.&lt;ref name="Mure Dickie"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/japanese-anti-nuclear-demonstrations-grow/2012/07/16/gJQAPXPgoW_story.html |title=Japanese anti-nuclear demonstrations grow |author=Mure Dickie |date=July 17, 2012 |work=Washington Post }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Anti-nuclear]] groups include the [[Citizens' Nuclear Information Center]], [[Stop Rokkasho]], [[Hibakusha|Hidankyo]], [[Sayonara Nuclear Power Plants]], Women from Fukushima Against Nukes, and the [[Article 9 of the Japanese Constitution|Article 9 group]]. People associated with the anti-nuclear movement include: [[Jinzaburo Takagi]], [[Haruki Murakami]], [[Kenzaburō Ōe]], [[Nobuto Hosaka]], [[Mizuho Fukushima]], [[Ryuichi Sakamoto]] and [[Tetsunari Iida]].

'''Nuru Energy''' is an international [[social enterprise]] which is working to address the global problem of [[global poverty|energy poverty]] and [[climate change in Africa]] and [[India]]. This is through the distribution of affordable [[LED lamp]]s that are recharged using a simple to use human powered generator that is more efficient than current solar.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://nuruenergy.com/about-nuru/|title = Nuru Energy - About us|date = |accessdate = 2015-03-30|website = |publisher = Nuru Energy|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Refimprove|date=April 2010}} [[File:Off Shore Drilling Rig, Santa Barbara, CA, 6 December, 2011.JPG|thumb|An oil drilling platform off the coast of Santa Barbara, CA - 6 December 2011]]
'''Offshore drilling''' is a mechanical process where a [[wellbore]] is drilled below the seabed.  It is typically carried out in order to explore for and subsequently extract [[petroleum]] which lies in rock formations beneath the seabed.  Most commonly, the term is used to describe drilling activities on the [[continental shelf]], though the term can also be applied to drilling in lakes, inshore waters and inland seas.

Offshore drilling presents environmental challenges, both offshore and onshorefrom the produced hydrocarbons and the materials used during the drilling operation. Controversies include the ongoing [[US offshore drilling debate|U.S. offshore drilling debate]].&lt;ref&gt;Compton, Glenn, ''[http://thebradentontimes.com/reasons-not-to-drill-for-oil-offshore-of-florida-p19415-137.htm 10 Reasons Not to Drill for Oil Offshore of Florida]'', The Bradenton Times, Sunday, January 14, 2018 &lt;/ref&gt;

There are many different types of facilities from which offshore drilling operations take place. These include bottom founded drilling rigs ([[Jackup rig|jackup barges]] and swamp barges), combined drilling and production facilities either bottom founded or floating platforms, and deepwater mobile offshore drilling units (MODU) including semi-submersibles and drillships.  These are capable of operating in water depths up to {{convert|3000|m|ft}}.  In shallower waters the mobile units are anchored to the seabed, however in deeper water (more than {{convert|1500|m|ft}} the [[Semi-submersible|semisubmersibles]] or [[drillship]]s are maintained at the required drilling location using [[dynamic positioning]].

==History==
Around 1891, the first submerged oil wells were drilled from platforms built on piles in the fresh waters of the [[Grand Lake St. Marys]] (a.k.a. Mercer County Reservoir) in [[Ohio]].  The wells were developed by small local companies such as Bryson, Riley Oil, German-American and Banker's Oil.

Around 1896, the first submerged oil wells in salt water were drilled in the portion of the [[Summerland Oil Field|Summerland field]] extending under the [[Santa Barbara Channel]] in [[California]].  The wells were drilled from piers extending from land out into the channel.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gomr.mms.gov/homepg/regulate/environ/louisiana_coast.html History of the Offshore Oil and Gas Development in Louisiana] at the Mineral Management Services, Dept of the Interior&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.noia.org/website/article.asp?id=123 National Ocean Industries Association]&lt;/ref&gt;

Other notable early submerged drilling activities occurred on the Canadian side of [[Lake Erie]] in the 1900s and [[Caddo Lake]] in [[Louisiana]] in the 1910s.  Shortly thereafter wells were drilled in tidal zones along the [[Texas]] and Louisiana [[Gulf Coast of the United States|gulf coast]].  The [[Goose Creek Oil Field]] near [[Baytown, Texas]] is one such example.  In the 1920s drilling activities occurred from concrete platforms in [[Venezuela]]'s [[Lake Maracaibo]].

One of the oldest subsea wells is the [[Bibiheybət|Bibi Eibat]] well, which came on stream in 1923 in [[Azerbaijan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.members.tripod.com/azmsa/oil.html|title=Oil in Azerbaijan|publisher=|accessdate=20 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{dubious|date=June 2010}}  The well was located on an artificial island in a shallow portion of the [[Caspian Sea]].  In the early 1930s, the Texas Co., later Texaco (now [[Chevron Corporation|Chevron]]) developed the first mobile steel barges for drilling in the brackish coastal areas of the Gulf of Mexico.

In 1937, Pure Oil (now [[Chevron Corporation|Chevron]]) and its partner Superior Oil (now [[ExxonMobil]]) used a fixed platform to develop a field {{convert|1|mi|km}} offshore of [[Calcasieu Parish, Louisiana]] in {{convert|14|ft|m}} of water.

In 1938, Humble Oil built  a mile-long wooden trestle with railway tracks into the sea at McFadden Beach on the Gulf of Mexico, placing a derrick at its end - this was later destroyed by a hurricane.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Morton|first1=Michael Quentin|title=Beyond Sight of Land: A History of Oil Exploration in the Gulf of Mexico|journal=GeoExpro|date=June 2016|volume=30|issue=3|pages=60-63|url=https://www.academia.edu/25960555/Beyond_Sight_of_Land_Oil_A_History_of_Oil_Exploration_in_the_Gulf_of_Mexico_2016_|accessdate=8 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1945, concern for American control of its offshore oil reserves caused President [[Harry Truman]] to issue an Executive Order unilaterally extending American territory to the edge of its continental shelf, an act that effectively ended the [[3-mile limit]] "[[freedom of the seas]]" regime.

In 1946, Magnolia Petroleum (now [[ExxonMobil]]) drilled at a site {{convert|18|mi|km}} off the coast, erecting a platform in {{convert|18|ft|m}} of water off [[St. Mary Parish, Louisiana]].

In early 1947, [[Superior Oil]] erected a drilling and production platform in {{convert|20|ft|m}} of water some {{convert|18|mi|km}} off Vermilion Parish, La.  But it was Kerr-McGee Oil Industries (now [[Anadarko Petroleum]]), as operator for partners Phillips Petroleum ([[ConocoPhillips]]) and Stanolind Oil &amp; Gas ([[BP]]) that completed its historic Ship Shoal Block 32 well in October 1947, months before Superior actually drilled a discovery from their Vermilion platform farther offshore. In any case, that made Kerr-McGee's well the first oil discovery drilled out of sight of land.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.google.com/search?q=history+of+offshore+oil+wells&amp;hl=en&amp;tbs=tl:1&amp;tbo=u&amp;ei=K2QWTKKsGoOBlAfl-IysDA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=timeline_result&amp;ct=title&amp;resnum=11&amp;ved=0CE8Q5wIwCg|title=history of offshore oil wells - Google Search|publisher=|accessdate=20 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When offshore drilling moved into deeper waters of up to {{convert|30|m|ft}}, fixed platform rigs were built, until demands for drilling equipment was needed in the {{convert|100|ft|m}} to {{convert|120|m|ft}} depth of the Gulf of Mexico, the first [[Jackup rig|jack-up rigs]] began appearing from specialized offshore drilling contractors such as forerunners of ENSCO International.

The first [[semi-submersible]] resulted from an unexpected observation in 1961. Blue Water Drilling Company owned and operated the four-column submersible Blue Water Rig No.1 in the Gulf of Mexico for [[Shell Oil Company]]. As the pontoons were not sufficiently buoyant to support the weight of the rig and its consumables, it was towed between locations at a draught midway between the top of the pontoons and the underside of the deck. It was noticed that the motions at this draught were very small, and Blue Water Drilling and Shell jointly decided to try operating the rig in the floating mode. The concept of an anchored, stable floating deep-sea platform had been designed and tested back in the 1920s by [[Edward Robert Armstrong]] for the purpose of operating aircraft with an invention known as the 'seadrome'. The first purpose-built drilling [[semi-submersible]] ''Ocean Driller'' was launched in 1963. Since then, many semi-submersibles have been purpose-designed for the drilling industry mobile offshore fleet.

The first offshore [[drillship]] was the ''CUSS 1'' developed for the [[Mohole]] project to drill into the Earth's crust.

As of June, 2010, there were over 620 mobile offshore drilling rigs (Jackups, semisubs, drillships, barges) available for service in the competitive rig fleet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rigzone.com/data/|title=RIGZONE - Offshore Rig Data, Onshore Fleet Analysis|publisher=|accessdate=20 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the world's deepest hubs is currently the [[Perdido oil platform|Perdido]] in the Gulf of Mexico, floating in 2,438 meters of water. It is operated by [[Royal Dutch Shell]] and was built at a cost of $3 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSN3123683920100331|title=UPDATE 1-Shell starts production at Perdido|work=Reuters|accessdate=20 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The deepest operational platform is the Petrobras America Cascade FPSO in the Walker Ridge 249 field in 2,600 meters of water.

==Challenges==
Offshore oil and gas production is more challenging than land-based installations due to the remote and harsher environment. Much of the innovation in the offshore petroleum sector concerns overcoming these challenges, including the need to provide very large production facilities. Production and drilling facilities may be very large and a large investment, such as the [[Troll A platform]] standing on a depth of 300 meters.

Another type of offshore platform may float with a mooring system to maintain it on location. While a floating system may be lower cost in deeper waters than a fixed platform, the dynamic nature of the platforms introduces many challenges for the drilling and production facilities.

The ocean can add several thousand meters or more to the fluid column. The addition increases the equivalent circulating density and downhole pressures in drilling wells, as well as the energy needed to lift produced fluids for separation on the platform.

The trend today is to conduct more of the production operations [[subsea]], by separating water from oil and re-injecting it rather than pumping it up to a platform, or by flowing to onshore, with no installations visible above the sea. Subsea installations help to exploit resources at progressively deeper waters—locations which had been inaccessible—and overcome challenges posed by sea ice such as in the [[Barents Sea]]. One such challenge in shallower environments is [[Seabed gouging by ice|seabed gouging by drifting ice features]] (means of protecting offshore installations against ice action includes burial in the seabed).

Offshore manned facilities also present logistics and human resources challenges. An offshore oil platform is a small community in itself with cafeteria, sleeping quarters, management and other support functions. In the North Sea, staff members are transported by helicopter for a two-week shift. They usually receive higher salary than onshore workers do. Supplies and waste are transported by ship, and the supply deliveries need to be carefully planned because storage space on the platform is limited. Today, much effort goes into relocating as many of the personnel as possible onshore, where management and technical experts are in touch with the platform by video conferencing. An onshore job is also more attractive for the aging workforce in the [[petroleum industry]], at least in the western world. These efforts among others are contained in the established term [[integrated operations]]. The increased use of subsea facilities helps achieve the objective of keeping more workers onshore. Subsea facilities are also easier to expand, with new separators or different modules for different oil types, and are not limited by the fixed floor space of an above-water installation.

==Effects on the environment==
{{see also |Oil platform#Ecological effects| label 1= ecological effects of oil platforms}}

Offshore oil production involves environmental risks, most notably [[oil spill]]s from oil tankers or pipelines transporting oil from the platform to onshore facilities, and from leaks and accidents on the platform.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video | title = Debate Over Offshore Drilling | medium = internet video | publisher = ''[[CBS News]]'' |date= 2008 | url = http://www.webcastr.com/videos/news/debate-over-offshore-drilling.html|accessdate=2008-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Produced water]] is also generated, which is water brought to the surface along with the oil and gas; it is usually highly saline and may include dissolved or unseparated hydrocarbons.

'''Osaki Channel Crossing''' is a [[power line]] crossing the [[Seto Inland Sea]] south of Yoshina, [[Takehara, Hiroshima|Takehara]] in Japan, which was built in 1997 and runs to the Ozaki Power Plant. The Ozaki Power Plant is owned by [[Chugoku Electric Power Company]] and is situated on an island on the Inland Sea. It has a span width of 2145 metres.

As at [[Chūshi Powerline Crossing]], towers with three crossbars are used. Their height is 223 metres, just 3 metres less than that of the Chūshi Powerline crossing, making them the second-tallest [[Transmission tower|electricity pylons]] in Japan.

Wilkinson "Advanced Inorganic Chemistry", 5th edition (1988), p.462&lt;/ref&gt; are dark red [[ionic compound]]s containing the reactive {{chem|O|3|−}} anion. The anion has the [[Bent molecular geometry|bent shape]] of the ozone molecule.

Inorganic ozonides are formed by burning [[potassium]], [[rubidium]], or [[caesium]] in [[ozone]], or by treating the [[alkali metal]] hydroxide with ozone; if potassium is left undisturbed in air for years it accumulates a covering of superoxide and ozonide. They are very sensitive explosives that have to be handled at low temperatures in an atmosphere consisting of an [[inert gas]]. Lithium and sodium ozonide are extremely unstable and must be prepared by low-temperature ion exchange starting from CsO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. Sodium ozonide, {{chem|NaO|3}}, which is prone to decomposition into [[Sodium Hydroxide|NaOH]] and [[sodium superoxide|{{chem|NaO|2}}]], was previously thought to be impossible to obtain in pure form.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1002/cber.19961290707 | title = Ionic Ozonides of Lithium and Sodium: Circumventive Synthesis by Cation Exchange in Liquid Ammonia and Complexation by Cryptands | year = 1996 | last1 = Korber | first1 = N. | last2 = Jansen | first2 = M. | journal = Chemische Berichte | volume = 129 | issue = 7| pages = 773–777}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, with the help of [[cryptand]]s and [[methylamine]], pure {{chem|NaO|3}} may be obtained as red crystals isostructural to [[sodium nitrite|{{chem|NaNO|2}}]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1039/a708570b | title = Synthesis and crystal structure determination of sodium ozonide | year = 1998 | last1 = Klein | first1 = W. | last2 = Armbruster | first2 = K. | last3 = Jansen | first3 = M. | journal = Chemical Communications | issue = 6 | pages = 707–708| url = http://www.rsc.org/delivery/_ArticleLinking/DisplayArticleForFree.cfm?doi=a708570b&amp;JournalCode=CC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ionic ozonides are being investigated{{cn|date=July 2017}} as sources of [[oxygen]] in [[chemical oxygen generator]]s. [[Tetramethylammonium]] ozonide, which can be made by a [[metathesis reaction]] with caesium ozonide in [[liquid ammonia]], is stable up to 348K:

: CsO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + [(CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;N][O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;] → CsO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + [(CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;N][O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]

== Covalent singly bonded structures ==
Phosphite ozonides, (RO)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;PO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, are used in the production of [[singlet oxygen]]. They are made by ozonizing a [[phosphite ester]] in [[dichloromethane]] at low temperatures, and decompose to yield singlet oxygen and a [[phosphate ester]]:&lt;ref name="InorgChem"&gt;{{cite book

==Molozonides==
Organic ozonides are called [[molozonide]]s and are typically formed by the addition reaction between ozone and [[alkene]]s. They are more explosive cousins of the [[organic peroxide]]s and as such are rarely isolated during the course of the ozonolysis reaction sequence. Molozonides are unstable and rapidly convert to the '''trioxolane''' ring structure with a five-membered C–O–O–C–O ring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Criegee|first1=Rudolf|title=Mechanism of Ozonolysis|journal=Angewandte Chemie International Edition in English|volume=14|issue=11|pages=745–752|doi=10.1002/anie.197507451}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.organic-chemistry.org/namedreactions/ozonolysis-criegee-mechanism.shtm Ozonolysis mechanism on Organic Chemistry Portal site&lt;/ref&gt; They usually appear in the form of foul-smelling oily liquids, and rapidly decompose in the presence of water to [[carbonyl]] compounds: [[aldehyde]]s, [[ketone]]s, [[peroxide]]s.

photonic properties in non-central symmetric semiconductor materials, using the piezoelectric potential (piezopotential) that is generated by applying a strain to a semiconductor with [[piezoelectricity]] to control the carrier generation, transport, separation and/or recombination at [[metal-semiconductor junction]] or [[p-n junction]] for improving the performance of [[optoelectronic]] devices, such as [[photodetector]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nanoscience.gatech.edu/paper/2010/10_ACSN_05.pdf] Qing Yang, Xin Guo, Wenhui Wang, Yan Zhang, Sheng Xu, Der-Hsien Lien, and Zhong Lin Wang, “Enhancing Sensitivity of a Single ZnO Micro-/Nanowire Photodetector by Piezo-phototronic Effect”, ACS Nano, 2010, 4, 6285-6291.&lt;/ref&gt; [[solar cell]] &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nanoscience.gatech.edu/paper/2011/11_NL_06.pdf] Ya Yang, Wenxi Guo, Yan Zhang, Yong Ding, Xue Wang, and Zhong Lin Wang, “Piezotronic Effect on the Output Voltage of P3HT/ZnO Micro/ Nanowire Heterojunction Solar Cells”, Nano Letters, 2011, 11, 4812-4817.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[light-emitting diode]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nanoscience.gatech.edu/paper/2011/11_NL_05.pdf] Qing Yang, Wenhui Wang, Sheng Xu, and Zhong Lin Wang, “Enhancing Light Emission of ZnO Microwire-Based Diodes by Piezo-Phototronic Effect”, Nano Letters, 2011, 11, 4012-4017.&lt;/ref&gt; Prof. Zhong Lin Wang at Georgia Institute of Technology proposed the fundamental principle of this effect in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nanoscience.gatech.edu/paper/2010/10_ACSN_01.pdf] Youfan Hu, Yanling Chang, Peng Fei, Robert L.

==Mechanism==
[[File:Piezophototronics.png|thumb|upright=1.5|[[Energy band diagram]]s for a p-n junction (a) with the absence of piezo-charges, and (b, c) with the presence of positive and negative piezo-charges at the junction, respectively. The red solid lines are the band diagrams with considering the piezopotential. Holes are trapped at the interface due to the piezopotential modified energy band, which will enhance the electron-hole recombination efficiency.]]
[[File:coupling.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Schematic diagram showing the three-way coupling among piezoelectricity, photoexcitation and semiconductor properties.]]

When a [[p-type semiconductor]] and a [[n-type semiconductor]] form a junction, the holes in the p-type side and the electrons in the n-type side tend to redistribute around the interface area to balance the local [[electric field]], which results in a charge [[depletion layer]]. The diffusion and recombination of the electrons and holes in the junction region is closely related to the [[optoelectronic]] properties of the device, which is greatly affected by the local electric field distribution. The existence of the piezo-charges at the interface introduces three effects: a shift in local [[electronic band structure]] due to the introduced local potential, a tilt of the [[electronic band structure]] over the junction region for the polarization existing in the [[piezoelectric]] semiconductor, and a change in the charge [[depletion layer]] due to the redistribution of the local charge carriers to balance the local piezo-charges. The positive [[piezoelectric]] charges at the junction lower the energy band and the negative [[piezoelectric]] charges raise the energy band in [[n-type semiconductor]] region near the junction region. A modification in the local band by piezopotential may be effective for trapping charges so that the electron-hole recombination rate can be largely enhanced, which is very beneficial for improving the efficiency of a [[light-emitting diode]]. Furthermore, the inclined band tends to change the mobility of the carriers moving toward the junction.
The materials for piezo-phototronics should have three basic properties: piezoelectricity, semiconductor property, and photon excitation property [5]. Typical materials are the wurtzite structures, such as [[ZnO]], [[GaN]] and [[InN]]. the three-way coupling among piezoelectricity, photoexcitation and semiconductor properties, which is the basis of [[piezotronics]] (piezoelectricity-semiconductor coupling), piezophotonics (piezoelectric-photon excitation coupling), optoelectronics, and piezo-phototronics piezoelectricity-semiconductor-photoexcitation). The core of these coupling relies on the piezopotential created by the piezoelectric materials.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2900">In a crystalline material, a [[dislocation]] is capable of traveling throughout the lattice when relatively small stresses are applied. This movement of dislocations results in the material [[Deformation (engineering)|plastically deforming]]. '''Pinning points''' in the material act to halt a dislocation's movement, requiring a greater amount of force to be applied to overcome the barrier. This results in an overall [[Strengthening mechanisms of materials|strengthening of materials]].

==Types of pinning points==
===Point defects===
[[Crystallographic defect#Point defects|Point defects]] (as well as stationary dislocations, jogs, and kinks) present in a material create [[stress field]]s within a material that disallow traveling dislocations to come into direct contact. Much like two particles of the same electric charge feel a repulsion to one another when brought together, the dislocation is pushed away from the already present stress field.

===Alloying elements=== 
The introduction of atom&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; into a crystal of atom&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; creates a pinning point for multiple reasons. An [[alloy]]ing atom is by nature a point defect, thus it must create a stress field when placed into a foreign crystallographic position, which could block the passage of a dislocation. However, it is possible that the alloying material is approximately the same size as the atom that is replaced, and thus its presence would not stress the lattice (as occurs in cobalt alloyed nickel). The different atom would, though, have a different [[elastic modulus]], which would create a different terrain for the moving dislocation. A higher modulus would look like an energy barrier, and a lower like an energy trough – both of which would stop its movement.

===Second phase precipitates===
{{main|Precipitation hardening}}
The [[precipitation (chemistry)|precipitation]] of a second phase within the lattice of a material creates physical blockades through which a dislocation cannot pass. The result is that the dislocation must bend (which requires greater energy, or a greater stress to be applied) around the precipitates, which inevitably leaves residual dislocation loops encircling the second phase material and shortens the original dislocation.

[[Image:Solute copy.jpg|thumb|900px|center|boarder|This schematic shows how a dislocation interacts with solid phase precipitates. The dislocation moves from left to right in each frame.]]

===Grain boundaries=== 
Dislocations require proper lattice ordering to move through a material. At [[grain boundary|grain boundaries]], there is a lattice mismatch, and every atom that lies on the boundary is [[Coordination number|uncoordinated]]. This stops dislocations that encounter the boundary from moving.

[[File:Positive Air Pressure.png|thumb|Fans or filters blow air into the system, creating a positive pressure. Excess air escapes passively through designed outlets.]]

'''Positive pressure''' is a pressure within a system that is greater than the environment that surrounds that system. Consequently, if there is any leak from the positively pressured system it will egress into the surrounding environment.

Use is also made of positive pressure to ensure there is no ingress of the environment into a supposed closed system. A typical example of the use of positive pressure is the location of a habitat in an area where there may exist flammable gases such as found on an [[oil platform]] or laboratory [[cleanroom]]. This kind of positive pressure is also used on [[operating theater]]s and [[In vitro fertilisation|''in vitro'' fertilisation]] (IVF) labs.

Hospitals may have positive pressure rooms for patients with compromised [[immune system]]s. Air will flow out of the room instead of in, so that any airborne microorganisms (e.g., bacteria) that may infect the patient are kept away.

This process is important in human and chick development. Positive pressure, created by the closure of anterior and posterior [[neuropore]]s of the [[neural tube]] during [[neurulation]], is a requirement of [[brain]] development.

[[Amphibian]]s use this process to [[Respiration (physiology)|respire]], whereby they use positive pressure to inflate their [[lung]]s.

'''Pressure''' (symbol: ''p'' or ''P'') is the [[force]] applied perpendicular to the surface of an object per unit [[area]] over which that force is distributed. [[Gauge pressure]] (also spelled ''gage'' pressure)&lt;ref group=lower-alpha&gt;The preferred spelling varies by country and even by industry. Further, both spellings are often used ''within'' a particular industry or country. Industries in British English-speaking countries typically use the "gauge" spelling.&lt;/ref&gt; is the pressure relative to the ambient pressure.

Various [[#Units|units]] are used to express pressure. Some of these derive from a unit of force divided by a unit of area; the [[International System of Units|SI]] unit of pressure, the [[Pascal (unit)|pascal]] (Pa), for example, is one [[newton (unit)|newton]] per [[square metre]]; similarly, the [[Pound (force)|pound-force]] per [[square inch]] ([[Pounds per square inch|psi]]) is the traditional unit of pressure in the [[imperial units|imperial]] and [[United States customary units|US customary]] systems. Pressure may also be expressed in terms of [[standard atmospheric pressure]]; the [[atmosphere (unit)|atmosphere]] (atm) is equal to this pressure, and the [[torr]] is defined as {{frac|760}} of this. Manometric units such as the [[centimetre of water]], [[millimetre of mercury]], and [[inch of mercury]] are used to express pressures in terms of the height of [[Pressure measurement#Liquid column|column of a particular fluid]] in a manometer.

==Definition==
'''Pressure''' is the amount of force applied at [[right angle]]s to the surface of an object per unit area. The symbol for it is ''p'' or ''P''.&lt;ref&gt;
{{Cite book |last=Giancoli |first=Douglas G. |title=Physics: principles with applications |year=2004 |publisher=Pearson Education |location=Upper Saddle River, N.J. |isbn=978-0-13-060620-4 |pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[IUPAC]] recommendation for pressure is a lower-case ''p''.&lt;ref name="IUPACGoldPressure"&gt;
{{cite book|url = http://goldbook.iupac.org/E02281.html|title = IUPAC. Compendium of Chemical Terminology, 2nd ed. (the "Gold Book")|publisher = Blackwell Scientific Publications|author1 = McNaught, A. D.|author2 = Wilkinson, A.|author3 = Nic, M.|author4 = Jirat, J.|author5 = Kosata, B.|author6 = Jenkins, A.|year = 2014|location = Oxford|isbn = 978-0-9678550-9-7|doi = 10.1351/goldbook.P04819|version = 2.3.3|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160304071856/http://goldbook.iupac.org/E02281.html|archivedate = 2016-03-04|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;
However, upper-case ''P'' is widely used. The usage of ''P'' vs ''p'' depends upon the field in which one is working, on the nearby presence of other symbols for quantities such as [[Power (physics)|power]] and [[momentum]], and on writing style.

===Formula===
{{Conjugate variables (thermodynamics)}}
[[File:Pressure force area.svg|200px|right]]
Mathematically:
:&lt;math&gt;p = \frac{F}{A},&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name="Georgia State University, Physics &amp; Astronomy"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/press.html |title=Pressure |accessdate=2018-06-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
where:
:&lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; is the pressure,
:&lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; is the magnitude of the [[normal force]],
:&lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is the area of the surface on contact.

Pressure is a [[Scalar (physics)|scalar]] quantity. It relates the vector surface element (a vector normal to the surface) with the normal force acting on it. The pressure is the scalar [[proportionality constant]] that relates the two normal vectors:
:&lt;math&gt;d\mathbf{F}_n = -p\,d\mathbf{A} = -p\,\mathbf{n}\,dA.&lt;/math&gt;

The minus sign comes from the fact that the force is considered towards the surface element, while the normal vector points outward. The equation has meaning in that, for any surface ''S'' in contact with the fluid, the total force exerted by the fluid on that surface is the [[surface integral]] over ''S'' of the right-hand side of the above equation.

It is incorrect (although rather usual) to say "the pressure is directed in such or such direction". The pressure, as a scalar, has no direction. The force given by the previous relationship to the quantity has a direction, but the pressure does not. If we change the orientation of the surface element, the direction of the normal force changes accordingly, but the pressure remains the same.

Pressure is distributed to solid boundaries or across arbitrary sections of fluid ''normal to'' these boundaries or sections at every point. It is a fundamental parameter in [[thermodynamics]], and it is [[conjugate variables (thermodynamics)|conjugate]] to [[Volume (thermodynamics)|volume]].

===Units===
[[File:Barometer mercury column hg.jpg|thumb|right|Mercury column]]
The [[SI]] unit for pressure is the [[Pascal (unit)|pascal]] (Pa), equal to one [[newton (unit)|newton]] per [[square metre]] (N/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, or kg·m&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;·s&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;). This name for the unit was added in 1971;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bipm.fr/en/convention/cgpm/14/pascal-siemens.html |title=14th Conference of the International Bureau of Weights and Measures |publisher=Bipm.fr |date= |accessdate=2012-03-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070630020548/http://www.bipm.fr/en/convention/cgpm/14/pascal-siemens.html |archivedate=2007-06-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; before that, pressure in SI was expressed simply in newtons per square metre.

Other units of pressure, such as [[pound-force per square inch|pounds per square inch]] and [[bar (unit)|bar]], are also in common use. The [[Centimetre–gram–second system of units|CGS]] unit of pressure is the [[barye]] (Ba), equal to 1&amp;nbsp;dyn·cm&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;, or 0.1&amp;nbsp;Pa. Pressure is sometimes expressed in grams-force or kilograms-force per square centimetre (g/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; or kg/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;!--don't add an f to kg, this is making the point about usage without it--&gt;) and the like without properly identifying the force units. But using the names kilogram, gram, kilogram-force, or gram-force (or their symbols) as units of force is expressly forbidden in SI. The [[technical atmosphere]] (symbol: at) is 1&amp;nbsp;kgf/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (98.0665&amp;nbsp;kPa, or 14.223&amp;nbsp;psi).

Since a system under pressure has the potential to perform work on its surroundings, pressure is a measure of potential energy stored per unit volume. It is therefore related to energy density and may be expressed in units such as [[joule]]s per cubic metre (J/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, which is equal to Pa).
Mathematically:
:&lt;math&gt;p = \frac{F \times \text{distance}}{A \times \text{distance}} = \frac{\text{work}}{\text{volume}} = \frac{\text{energy (J)}}{\text{volume }(\text{m}^3)}.&lt;/math&gt;

Some [[meteorologist]]s prefer the hectopascal (hPa) for atmospheric air pressure, which is equivalent to the older unit [[millibar]] (mbar). Similar pressures are given in kilopascals (kPa) in most other fields, where the hecto- prefix is rarely used. The inch of mercury is still used in the United States. Oceanographers usually measure underwater pressure in [[decibar]]s (dbar) because pressure in the ocean increases by approximately one decibar per metre depth.
 
The [[Atmosphere (unit)|standard atmosphere]] (atm) is an established constant. It is approximately equal to typical air pressure at Earth [[mean sea level]] and is defined as {{val|101325|u=Pa}}.

Because pressure is commonly measured by its ability to displace a column of liquid in a [[manometer]], pressures are often expressed as a depth of a particular fluid (e.g., [[centimetres of water]], [[millimetres of mercury]] or [[inches of mercury]]). The most common choices are [[Mercury (element)|mercury]] (Hg) and water; water is nontoxic and readily available, while mercury's high density allows a shorter column (and so a smaller manometer) to be used to measure a given pressure. The pressure exerted by a column of liquid of height ''h'' and density ''ρ'' is given by the hydrostatic pressure equation {{nowrap|1=''p'' = ''ρgh''}}, where ''g'' is the [[gravitational acceleration]]. Fluid density and local gravity can vary from one reading to another depending on local factors, so the height of a fluid column does not define pressure precisely. When millimetres of mercury or inches of mercury are quoted today, these units are not based on a physical column of mercury; rather, they have been given precise definitions that can be expressed in terms of SI units.{{Citation needed|date=January 2013}} One millimetre of mercury is approximately equal to one [[torr]]. The water-based units still depend on the density of water, a measured, rather than defined, quantity. These ''manometric units'' are still encountered in many fields. [[Blood pressure]] is measured in millimetres of mercury in most of the world, and lung pressures in centimetres of water are still common.

[[Underwater diving|Underwater divers]] use the [[metre sea water]] (msw or MSW) and [[foot sea water]] (fsw or FSW) units of pressure, and these are the standard units for pressure gauges used to measure pressure exposure in [[diving chamber]]s and [[Dive computer|personal decompression computers]]. A msw is defined as 0.1&amp;nbsp;bar (= 100000&amp;nbsp;Pa = 10000&amp;nbsp;Pa), is not the same as a linear metre of depth. 33.066&amp;nbsp;fsw = 1&amp;nbsp;atm&lt;ref name="usn T2.10"&gt;{{cite book |title=US Navy Diving Manual, 6th revision |pages=2–32 |year=2006 |publisher=US Naval Sea Systems Command |location=United States |url=http://www.supsalv.org/00c3_publications.asp?destPage=00c3&amp;pageID=3.9 |accessdate=2008-06-15 |author=US Navy |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080502023541/http://www.supsalv.org/00c3_publications.asp?destPage=00c3&amp;pageId=3.9 |archivedate=2008-05-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; (1&amp;nbsp;atm = 101325&amp;nbsp;Pa / 33.066 = 3064.326 Pa).

Gauge&lt;!--Editors are asked to PLEASE check the discussion page for this article before making changes regarding "gauge" vs. "gage" spelling issues. Much debate has transpired on this issue.--&gt; pressure is often given in units with "g" appended, e.g. "kPag", "barg" or "psig", and units for measurements of absolute pressure are sometimes given a suffix of "a", to avoid confusion, for example "kPaa", "psia". However, the US [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] recommends that, to avoid confusion, any modifiers be instead applied to the quantity being measured rather than the unit of measure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |accessdate=2009-07-07 |publisher=NIST |url=http://physics.nist.gov/Pubs/SP811/sec07.html#7.4 |title=Rules and Style Conventions for Expressing Values of Quantities |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090710192735/http://physics.nist.gov/Pubs/SP811/sec07.html#7.4 |archivedate=2009-07-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, {{nowrap|1="''p''&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt; = 100 psi"}} rather than {{nowrap|1="''p'' = 100 psig"}}.

Differential pressure is expressed in units with "d" appended; this type of measurement is useful when considering sealing performance or whether a valve will open or close.

Presently or formerly popular pressure units include the following:
*[[atmosphere (unit)|atmosphere]] (atm)
*manometric units:
**centimetre, inch, millimetre (torr) and micrometre (mTorr, micron) of mercury,
**{{anchor|H2O}}height of equivalent column of water, including [[Millimeters, water gauge|millimetre]] (mm {{chem|H|2|O}}), [[centimetre of water|centimetre]] (cm {{chem|H|2|O}}), metre, inch, and foot of water;
*imperial and customary units:

===Examples===
[[File:Aluminium cylinder.jpg|120px|thumbnail|right|The effects of an external pressure of 700&amp;nbsp;bar on an aluminum cylinder with 5&amp;nbsp;mm wall thickness]]
As an example of varying pressures, a finger can be pressed against a wall without making any lasting impression; however, the same finger pushing a [[thumbtack]] can easily damage the wall. Although the force applied to the surface is the same, the thumbtack applies more pressure because the point concentrates that force into a smaller area. Pressure is transmitted to solid boundaries or across arbitrary sections of fluid ''normal to'' these boundaries or sections at every point. Unlike [[stress (physics)|stress]], pressure is defined as a [[Scalar (physics)|scalar quantity]]. The negative [[gradient]] of pressure is called the [[force density]].

Another example is a knife. If we try to cut a fruit with the flat side, the force is distributed over a large area, and it will not cut. But if we use the edge, it will cut smoothly. The reason is that the flat side has a greater surface area (less pressure), and so it does not cut the fruit. When we take the thin side, the surface area is reduced, and so it cuts the fruit easily and quickly. This is one example of a practical application of pressure.

For gases, pressure is sometimes measured not as an ''absolute pressure'', but relative to [[atmospheric pressure]]; such measurements are called ''gauge&lt;!--Editors are asked to PLEASE check the discussion page for this article before making changes regarding "gauge" vs. "gage" spelling issues. Much debate has transpired on this issue.--&gt; pressure''. An example of this is the air pressure in an [[automobile]] [[tire]], which might be said to be "220&amp;nbsp;[[pascal (unit)|kPa]] (32&amp;nbsp;psi)", but is actually 220&amp;nbsp;kPa (32&amp;nbsp;psi) above atmospheric pressure. Since atmospheric pressure at sea level is about 100&amp;nbsp;kPa (14.7&amp;nbsp;psi), the absolute pressure in the tire is therefore about 320&amp;nbsp;kPa (46.7&amp;nbsp;psi). In technical work, this is written "a gauge&lt;!--Editors are asked to PLEASE check the discussion page for this article before making changes regarding "gauge" vs. "gage" spelling issues. Much debate has transpired on this issue.--&gt; pressure of 220&amp;nbsp;kPa (32&amp;nbsp;psi)".

Gauge&lt;!--Editors are asked to PLEASE check the discussion page for this article before making changes regarding "gauge" vs. "gage" spelling issues. Much debate has transpired on this issue.--&gt; pressure is the relevant measure of pressure wherever one is interested in the stress on [[Pressure vessel|storage vessels]] and the plumbing components of fluidics systems. However, whenever equation-of-state properties, such as densities or changes in densities, must be calculated, pressures must be expressed in terms of their absolute values. For instance, if the atmospheric pressure is 100&amp;nbsp;kPa, a gas (such as helium) at 200&amp;nbsp;kPa (gauge&lt;!--Editors are asked to PLEASE check the discussion page for this article before making changes regarding "gauge" vs. "gage" spelling issues. Much debate has transpired on this issue.--&gt;) (300&amp;nbsp;kPa [absolute]) is 50% denser than the same gas at 100&amp;nbsp;kPa (gauge&lt;!--Editors are asked to PLEASE check the discussion page for this article before making changes regarding "gauge" vs. "gage" spelling issues. Much debate has transpired on this issue.--&gt;) (200&amp;nbsp;kPa [absolute]). Focusing on gauge&lt;!--Editors are asked to PLEASE check the discussion page for this article before making changes regarding "gauge" vs. "gage" spelling issues. Much debate has transpired on this issue.--&gt; values, one might erroneously conclude the first sample had twice the density of the second one.

===Scalar nature===
In a static [[gas]], the gas as a whole does not appear to move. The individual molecules of the gas, however, are in constant [[Brownian motion|random motion]]. Because we are dealing with an extremely large number of molecules and because the motion of the individual molecules is random in every direction, we do not detect any motion. If we enclose the gas within a container, we detect a pressure in the gas from the molecules colliding with the walls of our container. We can put the walls of our container anywhere inside the gas, and the force per unit area (the pressure) is the same. We can shrink the size of our "container" down to a very small point (becoming less true as we approach the atomic scale), and the pressure will still have a single value at that point. Therefore, pressure is a scalar quantity, not a vector quantity. It has magnitude but no direction sense associated with it. Pressure force acts in all directions at a point inside a gas. At the surface of a gas, the pressure force acts perpendicular (at right angle) to the surface.

A closely related quantity is the [[stress (physics)|stress]] tensor ''σ'', which relates the vector force &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F}&lt;/math&gt; to the 
[[vector area]] &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A}&lt;/math&gt; via the linear relation &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F} = \sigma\mathbf{A}&lt;/math&gt;.

This [[tensor]] may be expressed as the sum of the [[viscous stress tensor]] minus the hydrostatic pressure. The negative of the stress tensor is sometimes called the pressure tensor, but in the following, the term "pressure" will refer only to the scalar pressure.

According to the theory of [[general relativity]], pressure increases the strength of a gravitational field (see [[stress–energy tensor]]) and so adds to the mass-energy cause of [[gravity]]. This effect is unnoticeable at everyday pressures but is significant in [[neutron star]]s, although it has not been experimentally tested.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/c3540l4q9nr17627/ |title=Einstein's gravity under pressure |accessdate=2012-03-27 |doi=10.1007/s10509-009-0016-8 |volume=321 |issue=2 |journal=Astrophysics and Space Science |pages=151–156|arxiv=0705.0825 |bibcode=2009Ap&amp;SS.321..151V |year=2009 |last1=Vishwakarma |first1=Ram Gopal }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==

===Fluid pressure===

'''Fluid pressure''' is most often the compressive stress at some point within a [[fluid]].  (The term ''fluid'' refers to both liquids and gases – for more information specifically about liquid pressure, see [[Pressure#Liquid pressure|section below]].)
[[File:Defekter unterflurhydrant goettingen.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Water shooting out a damaged hydrant at high pressure]]
Fluid pressure occurs in one of two situations:
# An open condition, called "open channel flow", e.g. the ocean, a swimming pool, or the atmosphere.
# A closed condition, called "closed conduit", e.g. a water line or gas line.

Pressure in open conditions usually can be approximated as the pressure in "static" or non-moving conditions (even in the ocean where there are waves and currents), because the motions create only negligible changes in the pressure. Such conditions conform with principles of [[fluid statics]]. The pressure at any given point of a non-moving (static) fluid is called the '''hydrostatic pressure'''. &lt;!--For bolding note that this page is the target of redirection from "hydrostatic pressure"--&gt;

Closed bodies of fluid are either "static", when the fluid is not moving, or "dynamic", when the fluid can move as in either a pipe or by compressing an air gap in a closed container. The pressure in closed conditions conforms with the principles of [[fluid dynamics]].

The concepts of fluid pressure are predominantly attributed to the discoveries of [[Blaise Pascal]] and [[Daniel Bernoulli]]. [[Bernoulli's equation]] can be used in almost any situation to determine the pressure at any point in a fluid. The equation makes some assumptions about the fluid, such as the fluid being ideal&lt;ref name=Finnemore&gt;{{cite book |last=Finnemore, John, E. and Joseph B.

===Explosion or deflagration pressures===
[[Explosion]] or [[deflagration]] pressures are the result of the ignition of explosive [[gas]]es, mists, dust/air suspensions, in unconfined and confined spaces.

=== Negative pressures ===

[[File:13-07-23-kienbaum-unterdruckkammer-33.jpg|thumb|Low-pressure chamber in [[Bundesleistungszentrum Kienbaum]], Germany]]

While '''pressures''' are, in general, positive, there are several situations in which negative pressures may be encountered:
*When dealing in relative (gauge&lt;!--Editors are asked to PLEASE check the discussion page for this article before making changes regarding "gauge" vs. "gage" spelling issues. Much debate has transpired on this issue.--&gt;) pressures. For instance, an absolute pressure of 80&amp;nbsp;kPa may be described as a gauge&lt;!--Editors are asked to PLEASE check the discussion page for this article before making changes regarding "gauge" vs. "gage" spelling issues. Much debate has transpired on this issue.--&gt; pressure of −21&amp;nbsp;kPa (i.e., 21&amp;nbsp;kPa below an atmospheric pressure of 101&amp;nbsp;kPa).
*When attractive [[intermolecular force]]s (e.g., [[van der Waals force]]s&lt;!--"van", see [[Talk:Van der Waals#Van should be capitalized unless preceded by first name]] rebuttal--&gt; or [[hydrogen bond]]s) between the particles of a fluid exceed repulsive forces due to thermal motion. These forces explain [[ascent of sap]] in tall plants. A negative pressure acts on water molecules at the top of any tree taller than 10&amp;nbsp;m, which is the [[pressure head]] of water that balances the atmospheric pressure. Intermolecular forces maintain cohesion of columns of sap that run continuously in [[xylem]] from the roots to the top leaves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=The Physics of Negative Pressure | url=http://discovermagazine.com/2003/mar/featscienceof | publisher=[[Discover (magazine)|Discover]] | author=Karen Wright | accessdate=31 January 2015 | date=March 2003 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150108182004/http://discovermagazine.com/2003/mar/featscienceof | archivedate=8 January 2015 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The [[Casimir effect]] can create a small attractive force due to interactions with [[vacuum energy]]; this force is sometimes termed "vacuum pressure" (not to be confused with the negative ''gauge&lt;!--Editors are asked to PLEASE check the discussion page for this article before making changes regarding "gauge" vs. "gage" spelling issues. Much debate has transpired on this issue.--&gt; pressure'' of a vacuum).
*For non-isotropic stresses in rigid bodies, depending on how the orientation of a surface is chosen, the same distribution of forces may have a component of positive pressure along one [[Normal (geometry)|surface normal]], with a component of negative pressure acting along another surface normal.
**The stresses in an [[electromagnetic field]] are generally non-isotropic, with the pressure normal to one surface element (the [[normal stress]]) being negative, and positive for surface elements perpendicular to this.
*In the [[cosmological constant]].

===Stagnation pressure===&lt;!--This section is linked from [[Drag equation]]--&gt;
[[Stagnation pressure]] is the pressure a fluid exerts when it is forced to stop moving. Consequently, although a fluid moving at higher speed will have a lower [[static pressure]], it may have a higher stagnation pressure when forced to a standstill. Static pressure and stagnation pressure are related by:
:&lt;math&gt;p_{0} = \frac{1}{2}\rho v^2 + p&lt;/math&gt;

where 
:&lt;math&gt;p_0&lt;/math&gt; is the [[stagnation pressure]]
:&lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; is the flow velocity
:&lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; is the static pressure.

The pressure of a moving fluid can be measured using a [[Pitot tube]], or one of its variations such as a [[Kiel probe]] or [[Cobra probe]], connected to a [[manometer]]. Depending on where the inlet holes are located on the probe, it can measure static pressures or stagnation pressures.

===Surface pressure and surface tension===
There is a two-dimensional analog of pressure – the lateral force per unit length applied on a line perpendicular to the force.

Surface pressure is denoted by π:
:&lt;math&gt;\pi = \frac{F}{l}&lt;/math&gt;
and shares many similar properties with three-dimensional pressure. Properties of surface chemicals can be investigated by measuring pressure/area isotherms, as the two-dimensional analog of [[Boyle's law]], {{nowrap|''πA'' {{=}} ''k''}}, at constant temperature.

[[Surface tension]] is another example of surface pressure, but with a reversed sign, because "tension" is the opposite to "pressure".

=== Pressure of an ideal gas ===
{{main article|Ideal gas law}}
In an [[ideal gas]], molecules have no volume and do not interact. According to the [[ideal gas law]], pressure varies linearly with temperature and quantity, and inversely with volume:
:&lt;math&gt;p = \frac{nRT}{V},&lt;/math&gt;

where:
:''p'' is the absolute pressure of the gas,
:''n'' is the [[amount of substance]],
:''T'' is the absolute temperature,
:''V'' is the volume,
:''R'' is the [[ideal gas constant]].

[[Real gas]]es exhibit a more complex dependence on the variables of state.&lt;ref&gt;P. Atkins, J. de Paula ''Elements of Physical Chemistry'', 4th Ed, W. H. Freeman, 2006. {{ISBN|0-7167-7329-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vapour pressure===
{{main article|Vapour pressure}}
Vapour pressure is the pressure of a [[vapour]] in [[thermodynamic equilibrium]] with its condensed [[Phase (matter)|phase]]s in a closed system. All liquids and [[solid]]s have a tendency to [[evaporate]] into a gaseous form, and all [[gas]]es have a tendency to [[condense]] back to their liquid or solid form.

The [[atmospheric pressure]] [[boiling point]] of a liquid (also known as the [[normal boiling point]]) is the temperature at which the vapor pressure equals the ambient atmospheric pressure. With any incremental increase in that temperature, the vapor pressure becomes sufficient to overcome atmospheric pressure and lift the liquid to form vapour bubbles inside the bulk of the substance. [[liquid bubble|Bubble]] formation deeper in the liquid requires a higher pressure, and therefore higher temperature, because the fluid pressure increases above the atmospheric pressure as the depth increases.

The vapor pressure that a single component in a mixture contributes to the total pressure in the system is called [[partial pressure|partial vapor pressure]].

===Liquid pressure===
{{See also|Fluid statics#Pressure in fluids at rest}}
{{Continuum mechanics}}
When a person swims under the water, water pressure is felt acting on the person's eardrums. The deeper that person swims, the greater the pressure. The pressure felt is due to the weight of the water above the person. As someone swims deeper, there is more water above the person and therefore greater pressure. The pressure a liquid exerts depends on its depth.

Liquid pressure also depends on the density of the liquid. If someone was submerged in a liquid more dense than water, the pressure would be correspondingly greater. thus we can say that the depth, density and liquid pressure are directly proportionate. The pressure due to a liquid in liquid columns of constant density or at a depth within a substance is represented by the following formula:
:&lt;math&gt;p = \rho gh,&lt;/math&gt;

where:
:''p'' is liquid pressure,
:''g'' is gravity at the surface of overlaying material,
:''ρ'' is [[density]] of liquid,
:''h'' is height of liquid column or depth within a substance.

Another way of saying the same formula is the following:

:&lt;math&gt;p = \text{weight density} \times \text{depth}.&lt;/math&gt;

{| class="toccolours collapsible collapsed" width="60%" style="text-align:left"
!Derivation of this equation
|-
|This is derived from the definitions of pressure and weight density. Consider an area at the bottom of a vessel of liquid. The weight of the column of liquid directly above this area produces pressure. From the definition

:&lt;math&gt;\text{weight density} = \frac{\text{weight}}{\text{volume}}&lt;/math&gt;

we can express this weight of liquid as

:&lt;math&gt;\text{weight} = \text{weight density} \times \text{volume},&lt;/math&gt;

where the volume of the column is simply the area multiplied by the depth. Then we have

:&lt;math&gt;\text{pressure} = \frac{\text{force}}{\text{area}} = \frac{\text{weight}}{\text{area}} = \frac{\text{weight density} \times \text{volume}}{\text{area}},&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\text{pressure} = \frac{\text{weight density} \times \text{(area} \times \text{depth)}}{\text{area}}.&lt;/math&gt;

With the "area" in the numerator and the "area" in the denominator canceling each other out, we are left with

:&lt;math&gt;\text{pressure} = \text{weight density} \times \text{depth}.&lt;/math&gt;

Written with symbols, this is our original equation:
:&lt;math&gt;p= \rho gh.&lt;/math&gt;
|}

The pressure a liquid exerts against the sides and bottom of a container depends on the density and the depth of the liquid. If atmospheric pressure is neglected, liquid pressure against the bottom is twice as great at twice the depth; at three times the depth, the liquid pressure is threefold; etc. Or, if the liquid is two or three times as dense, the liquid pressure is correspondingly two or three times as great for any given depth. Liquids are practically incompressible – that is, their volume can hardly be changed by pressure (water volume decreases by only 50 millionths of its original volume for each atmospheric increase in pressure). Thus, except for small changes produced by temperature, the density of a particular liquid is practically the same at all depths.

Atmospheric pressure pressing on the surface of a liquid must be taken into account when trying to discover the ''total'' pressure acting on a liquid. The total pressure of a liquid, then, is ''ρgh'' plus the pressure of the atmosphere. When this distinction is important, the term ''total pressure'' is used. Otherwise, discussions of liquid pressure refer to pressure without regard to the normally ever-present atmospheric pressure.

It is important to recognize that the pressure does not depend on the ''amount'' of liquid present. Volume is not the important factor – depth is. The average water pressure acting against a dam depends on the average depth of the water and not on the volume of water held back. For example, a wide but shallow lake with a depth of {{convert|3|m|0|abbr=on}} exerts only half the average pressure that a small {{convert|6|m|abbr=on}} deep pond does (note that the ''total force'' applied to the longer dam will be greater, due to the greater total surface area for the pressure to act upon, but for a given 5-foot section of each dam, the 10&amp;nbsp;ft deep water will apply half the force of 20&amp;nbsp;ft deep water). A person will feel the same pressure whether his/her head is dunked a metre beneath the surface of the water in a small pool or to the same depth in the middle of a large lake. If four vases contain different amounts of water but are all filled to equal depths, then a fish with its head dunked a few centimetres under the surface will be acted on by water pressure that is the same in any of the vases. If the fish swims a few centimetres deeper, the pressure on the fish will increase with depth and be the same no matter which vase the fish is in. If the fish swims to the bottom, the pressure will be greater, but it makes no difference what vase it is in. All vases are filled to equal depths, so the water pressure is the same at the bottom of each vase, regardless of its shape or volume. If water pressure at the bottom of a vase were greater than water pressure at the bottom of a neighboring vase, the greater pressure would force water sideways and then up the narrower vase to a higher level until the pressures at the bottom were equalized. Pressure is depth dependent, not volume dependent, so there is a reason that water seeks its own level.

Restating this as energy equation, the energy per unit volume in an ideal, incompressible liquid is constant throughout its vessel. At the surface, gravitational potential energy is large but liquid pressure energy is low. At the bottom of the vessel, all the gravitational potential energy is converted to pressure energy. The sum of pressure energy and gravitational potential energy per unit volume is constant throughout the volume of the fluid and the two energy components change linearly with the depth.&lt;ref&gt;Streeter, V. L., ''Fluid Mechanics'', Example&amp;nbsp;3.5, McGraw&amp;ndash;Hill Inc. (1966), New York.&lt;/ref&gt;  Mathematically, it is described by [[Bernoulli's equation]], where velocity head is zero and comparisons per unit volume in the vessel are
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{p}{\gamma} + z = \mathrm{const}.&lt;/math&gt;

Terms have the same meaning as in [[#Fluid pressure|section Fluid pressure]].

===Direction of liquid pressure===
An experimentally determined fact about liquid pressure is that it is exerted equally in all directions.&lt;ref name="Hewitt"&gt;Hewitt 251 (2006)&lt;/ref&gt; If someone is submerged in water, no matter which way that person tilts his/her head, the person will feel the same amount of water pressure on his/her ears. Because a liquid can flow, this pressure isn't only downward. Pressure is seen acting sideways when water spurts sideways from a leak in the side of an upright can. Pressure also acts upward, as demonstrated when someone tries to push a beach ball beneath the surface of the water. The bottom of a boat is pushed upward by water pressure ([[buoyancy]]).

When a liquid presses against a surface, there is a net force that is perpendicular to the surface. Although pressure doesn't have a specific direction, force does. A submerged triangular block has water forced against each point from many directions, but components of the force that are not perpendicular to the surface cancel each other out, leaving only a net perpendicular point.&lt;ref name="Hewitt" /&gt; This is why water spurting from a hole in a bucket initially exits the bucket in a direction at right angles to the surface of the bucket in which the hole is located. Then it curves downward due to gravity. If there are three holes in a bucket (top, bottom, and middle), then the force vectors perpendicular to the inner container surface will increase with increasing depth – that is, a greater pressure at the bottom makes it so that the bottom hole will shoot water out the farthest. The force exerted by a fluid on a smooth surface is always at right angles to the surface. The speed of liquid out of the hole is &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \sqrt{2gh}&lt;/math&gt;, where ''h'' is the depth below the free surface.&lt;ref name="Hewitt" /&gt; This is the same speed the water (or anything else) would have if freely falling the same vertical distance ''h''.

===Kinematic pressure===
:&lt;math&gt;P=p/\rho_0&lt;/math&gt;
is the kinematic pressure, where &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; is the pressure and &lt;math&gt;\rho_0&lt;/math&gt; constant mass density. The SI unit of ''P'' is m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Kinematic pressure is used in the same manner as [[kinematic viscosity]] &lt;math&gt;\nu&lt;/math&gt; in order to compute [[Navier–Stokes equation]] without explicitly showing the density &lt;math&gt;\rho_0&lt;/math&gt;.

;Navier–Stokes equation with kinematic quantities
:&lt;math&gt; \frac{\partial u}{\partial t} + (u \nabla) u = - \nabla P + \nu \nabla^2 u. &lt;/math&gt;

'''Revitalizant''' ({{lang-la|vita}} — life, can be literally translated to “bringing back to life”) — a semi permanent treatment for [[friction metal|metals]] found in automobile engines, transmissions, fuel pumps, and other friction surfaces in industrial and other machines.  The treatment is added to the engine oil, operating [[fluid]]s, or [[fuel]].  The treatment forms a protective [[cermet or ceramic-metal]] [[coating]] on the friction metal parts of the mechanisms directly during the process of their operation. The '' Revitalizant '' solves the problem of non-wear operation of cars and mechanisms.&lt;ref&gt;Garkunov, D. N. Tribotechnika. Moscow: Mashinostrojenie, 1985: 424 p. (in Russian).&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Revitalizant experiment 4.jpg|thumb| Appearance of the bearing race with a defect made on purpose]]
[[File:Revitalizant experiment.jpg|thumb|  Magnified view of the initial surface of the part]]
[[File:Revitalizant experiment 2.jpg|thumb| Effect of revitalizant. Modification of the friction surface. Start of defect closing.]]
[[File:Revitalizant experiment 3.jpg|thumb| Surface defect eliminated. Detailed information about terms of obtaining the pictures.'' [http://revitalizant.com/]]]

The ''Revitalizant'' was developed in 1998 in [[Kharkiv]] ([[Ukraine]]). The composition and the method of its preparation are patented. The notion was included in the textbook on [[tribology]].&lt;ref&gt;Kindrachuk, M. V., Labunetz, V. F., Pashechko, M.I., Korbut, Ye.V. Tribologia: textbook / Ministry of Education and Science. – Kyiv: NAU-print, 2009. – 392 p. (in Ukrainian).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==
Visually it is a [[gel]] or a plastic substance. It consists of a lubricant and a mixture of [[oxide]]s and metal oxide [[hydrate]]s: Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and/or SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and/or MgO and/or CaO and/or Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; etc., with [[Dispersion (chemistry)|dispersion]] from 100 to 10,000 [[nanometer]]s.

== Properties ==
*Under certain conditions ([[pressure]] and [[temperature]]) typical for the contact of the parts during  friction, the substances contained in the revitalizant act as a [[catalyst]] for creating the metal [[carbide]] of coupling materials.

      &lt;math&gt; \mathrm{n Me + m C \rightarrow  Me_nC_m },&lt;/math&gt;
      where Me stands for metal; C - carbon.

*Particles of the substance have the form similar to the spherical and  during the process of friction they are acting as [[Case hardening|surface hardening]] and  at the same time as rolling substances, reducing the [[friction coefficient]].

== Process ==
The process of the protective [[coating]] formation, called [[revitalization]], is based on physical-chemical interaction between surfaces of the parts on the spots of virtual contact covered with revitalizant in a [[Lubrication#Regimes|boundary or mixed lubrication]] mode. As a result a gradient [[cermet]] coating is formed, containing positive compressive stresses all over its depth and concentration of [[carbon]], increasing at the surface  (up to the formation of [[diamond]]-like structures). Distinctive feature of the process is a hardening of the coating with its simultaneous growth&lt;ref&gt;Dzhus R. N.

Pole-mounted single-phase transformer with three-wire [[center tap|center-tapped]] "split-phase" secondary. One side of the primary is connected to ground. On the three secondary terminals, the center tap is also grounded with a short strap to the transformer case. ]]
A '''split-phase''' or '''single-phase three-wire''' system is a type of [[Single-phase electric power|single-phase]] electric power distribution. It is the [[alternating current|AC]] equivalent of the original Edison three-wire direct-current system. Its primary advantage is that it saves conductor material over a single-ended single-phase system, while only requiring a single phase on the supply side of the distribution transformer.&lt;ref&gt;Terrell Croft and Wilford Summers (ed), ''American Electricians' Handbook, Eleventh Edition'', McGraw Hill, New York (1987) {{ISBN|0-07-013932-6}}, chapter 3, pages 3-10, 3-14 to 3-22.&lt;/ref&gt;

The two 120 V AC lines are supplied to the premises from a transformer with a 240 V AC [[Transformer|secondary]] winding which has a [[center tap ]] connected to ground. The system neutral conductor is connected to ground at the transformer center tap.  This results in two 120 V AC line voltages which are out of phase by 180 degrees with each other. When required, 240 V AC can be obtained by connecting the load between the two 120 V AC lines.


==Connections==
[[image:split phase2.png|329px|thumb|right|Fig. 1]]
[[File:Vector diag 3 wire single phase.svg|thumb|right|Fig. 2]]
A [[transformer]] supplying a three-wire distribution system has a single-phase input (primary) winding. The output (secondary) winding is center-tapped and the [[center tap]] connected to a grounded [[Ground and neutral|neutral]]. As shown in Fig. 1. either end to center has half the voltage of end-to-end. Fig. 2 illustrates the [[phasor]] diagram of the output voltages for a split-phase transformer. Since the two phasors do not define a unique direction of rotation for a [[Three phase#revolving magnetic field | revolving magnetic field]], a split single-phase is not a two-phase system. 

In the United States and Canada, the practice originated with the DC distribution system developed by [[Thomas Edison]]. By connecting pairs of lamps or groups of lamps on the same circuit in series, and doubling the supply voltage, the size of conductors was reduced substantially.

The line to neutral voltage is half the line-to-line voltage. Lighting and small appliances requiring less than 1800 watts may be connected between a line wire and the neutral. Higher wattage appliances, such as cooking equipment, space heating, water pumps, clothes dryers, and air conditioners are connected across the two line conductors. This means that (for the supply of the same amount of power) the current is halved. Hence, smaller conductors may be used than would be needed if the appliances were designed to be supplied by the lower voltage.&lt;ref name=gonen07&gt;Gonen, Turan. ''Electric Power Distribution System Engineering, 2nd ed.'' CRC Press, 2007, p. 284.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[image:3wire resistive loads.svg|thumb|right|Fig. 4]]
[[image:quarter copper.PNG|thumb|right|Fig. 5]]
If the load were guaranteed to be balanced, then the neutral conductor would not carry any current and the system would be equivalent to a single-ended system of twice the voltage with the line wires taking half the current. This would not need a neutral conductor at all, but would be wildly impractical for varying loads; just connecting the groups in series would result in excessive voltage and brightness variation as lamps are switched on and off.

By connecting the two lamp groups to a neutral, intermediate in potential between the two live legs, any imbalance of the load will be supplied by a current in the neutral, giving substantially constant voltage across both groups. The total current carried in all three wires (including the neutral) will always be twice the supply current of the most heavily loaded half.

For short wiring runs limited by conductor [[ampacity]], this allows three half-sized conductors to be substituted for two full-sized ones, using 75% of the copper of an equivalent single-phase system.

Longer wiring runs are more limited by voltage drop in the conductors. Because the supply voltage is doubled, a balanced load can tolerate double the voltage drop, allowing quarter-sized conductors to be used; this uses 3/8 the copper of an equivalent single-phase system.

In practice, some intermediate value is chosen. For example, if the imbalance is limited to 25% of the total load (half of one half) rather than the absolute worst-case 50%, then conductors 3/8 of the single-phase size will guarantee the same maximum voltage drop, totalling 9/8 of one single-phase conductor, 56% of the copper of the two single-phase conductors.

==Balanced power==
In a so-called ''balanced power'' system, an isolation [[transformer]] with a center tap is used to create a separate supply with conductors at a balanced Vnom/2 with respect to ground. The purpose of a balanced power system is to minimize the noise coupled into sensitive equipment from the power supply. 

Unlike a three-wire distribution system, the grounded neutral is not distributed to the loads; only line-to-line connections at 120 V are used. A balanced power system is only used for specialized distribution in audio and video production studios, sound and television broadcasting, and installations of sensitive scientific instruments. 

The U.S.  [[National Electrical Code]] provides rules for technical power installations.&lt;ref&gt;NFPA 70, National Electrical Code 2005, National Fire Protection Association, Inc., Quincy, Massachusetts USA, (2005). no ISBN , articles 640 and  647&lt;/ref&gt; The systems are not to be used for general-purpose lighting or other equipment, and may use special sockets to ensure only approved equipment is connected to the system. Additionally, technical power systems pay special attention to the way the distribution system is grounded.

A risk of using a balanced power system, in an installation that also uses "conventional" power in the same rooms, is that a user may inadvertently interconnect the power systems together via an intermediate system of audio or video equipment, elements of which might be connected to different power systems.

==Applications==

===Europe===
In [[Europe]], [[Three-phase electric power|three-phase]] 230/400 V is most commonly used. However, 230/460 V, three-wire, [[Single-phase electric power|single-phase]] systems are used to run farms and small groups of houses when only two of the [[Three-phase electric power|three-phase]] high-voltage conductors are used.  A split-phase final step-down transformer is then used, with the centre-tap earthed and the two halves usually supplying different buildings with a single phase supply, although in the UK a large farm may be given a 230-0-230 supply.

In the [[United Kingdom|UK]], electric tools and portable lighting at larger construction and demolition sites are governed by BS7375, and where possible are recommended to be fed from a centre-tapped system with only 55 V between live conductors and the earth (so called CTE or Centre Tap Earth, or 55-0-55). This reduced low voltage system is used with 110 V equipment. No neutral conductor is distributed. In high hazard locations, additional double pole [[Residual-current device|RCD]] protection may be used. The intention is to reduce the electrocution hazard that may exist when using electrical equipment at a wet or outdoor construction site, and eliminate the requirement for rapid automatic disconnection for prevention of shocks during faults. Portable transformers that transform single-phase 240 V to this 110 V split-phase system are a common piece of construction equipment. Generator sets used for construction sites are equipped to supply it directly.

An incidental benefit is that the filaments of 110 V [[incandescent lamp]]s used on such systems are thicker and therefore mechanically more rugged than those of 240 V lamps.

===North America===
This three-wire single phase system is common in North America for residential and light commercial applications. Circuit [[breaker panel]]s typically have two hot wires, and a neutral, connected at one point to the grounded center tap of a local transformer). Single pole [[circuit breaker]]s feed 120 volt circuits from one of the 120 volt busses within the panel, or two-pole circuit breakers feed 240 volt circuits from both busses. 120 V circuits are the most common, and used to power [[NEMA 1]] and [[NEMA 5]] outlets, and most residential and light commercial direct-wired lighting circuits. 240 V circuits are used for high-demand applications, such as [[air conditioner]]s, [[space heater]]s,  [[electric stove]]s, electric [[clothes dryer]]s,  [[air conditioner]]s, [[water heater]]s, and electric vehicle [[charge point]]s. These use [[NEMA 10]] or [[NEMA 14]] outlets that are deliberately incompatible with the 120 V outlets.

Wiring regulations govern the application of split-phase circuits. Since the neutral (return) conductor is not protected by a fuse or circuit breaker, a neutral wire can be shared only by two circuits fed from opposite lines of the supply system. Two circuits from opposing lines may share a neutral if both breakers are connected by a bar so that both trip simultaneously (&lt;ref&gt;http://ecmweb.com/code-basics/branch-circuits-part-1&lt;/ref&gt;NEC 210.4), this prevents 120 V from feeding across 240 V circuits.

==Railways==
In [[Electric power supply system of railways in Sweden|Sweden]] split-phase electric power is also used on some railways. The center tap is grounded, one pole is fed with an overhead wire section, while the other wire is used for another section.

[[Amtrak's 60 Hz traction power system]] in the [[Northeast Corridor]] between New York and Boston also uses split-phase power distribution. Two separate wires are run along the track, the contact wire for the locomotive and an electrically separate feeder wire. Each wire is fed with 25&amp;nbsp;kV with respect to ground, with 50&amp;nbsp;kV between them. [[Autotransformer]]s along the track balance the loads between the contact and feeder wires, reducing resistive losses.

In the UK [[Network Rail]] are using autotransformers on all new 50 Hz electrification, and (as of 2014) are converting many old booster transformer [http://www.railwaysarchive.co.uk/documents/BRB_Elec002.pdf] installations to autotransformers, to reduce energy losses [http://www.networkrail.co.uk/browse%20documents/track%20access/2%20completed%20consultations/2010/2010.06.11%20west%20coast%20trains%209th%20sa%20-%20consultation%20closed%2007%20july%202010/ec4t%20loss%20report%20v1.0.pdf] and exported electromagnetic interference, both of which increase when longer, heavier, or faster trains are introduced, drawing higher peak current from the supply. Note that booster transformers only "boost" the return of traction current through its intended path, the "return conductor", rather than randomly through the earth, and do not boost, but rather reduce, the available voltage at the train, and introduce additional losses. The autotransformer system enforces the traction return current taking its intended path, while reducing the transmission losses, and therefore achieves both required objectives, of controlling return current leakage to earth and ensuring low energy loss, simultaneously. There is an initial cost penalty, because the previous return conductor, insulated to a fairly modest voltage, must be replaced by an anti-phase feeder, insulated to 25 kV, and the autotransformers themselves are larger and more expensive than the previous booster transformers.

'''Strontium aluminate''' ('''SRA''', '''SrAl''', {{Strontium}}{{Aluminum}}&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;{{Oxygen}}&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) is a solid odorless, nonflammable, pale yellow, [[monoclinic]] crystalline powder, heavier than water. When [[activator (phosphor)|activated]] with a suitable [[dopant]] (e.g. [[europium]], then it is labeled Eu:SrAl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;), it acts as a [[photoluminescence|photoluminescent]] [[phosphor]] with long persistence of [[phosphorescence]].

There are also other strontium aluminates, e.g. SrAl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt; (monoclinic), Sr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; (cubic), SrAl&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;19&lt;/sub&gt; (hexagonal), Sr&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;Al&lt;sub&gt;14&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;25&lt;/sub&gt; ([[orthorhombic]]).

==Phosphor==
For many phosphorescent-based purposes, strontium aluminate is a vastly superior phosphor to its predecessor, [[copper]]-activated [[zinc sulfide]]; it is about 10 times brighter and 10 times longer glowing, however it is about 10 times more expensive than Cu:ZnS and it cannot produce the unique red phosphorescence of the latter. It is frequently used in [[Phosphorescence|glow in the dark]] toys, where it displaces the cheaper but less efficient Cu:ZnS. However, the material has high hardness, causing abrasion to the machinery handling it; manufacturers frequently coat the particles with a suitable lubricant when adding them to a plastic.

Different aluminates can be used as the host matrix. This influences the wavelength of emission of the europium ion, by its [[covalent]] interaction with surrounding oxygens, and [[crystal field]] splitting of the [[atomic orbital|5d orbital]] energy levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dutczak|first1=D.|last2=Jüstel|first2=T.|last3=Ronda|first3=C.|last4=Meijerink|first4=A.|title=Eu2+ luminescence in strontium aluminates|journal=Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys.|date=2015|volume=17|issue=23|pages=15236–15249|doi=10.1039/C5CP01095K}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Strontium aluminate phosphors produce green and [[aqua (color)|aqua]] hues, where green gives the highest brightness and aqua the longest glow time. The excitation wavelengths for strontium aluminate range from 200 to 450&amp;nbsp;nm. The wavelength for its green formulation is 520&amp;nbsp;nm, its aqua, or blue-green, version emits at 505&amp;nbsp;nm, and the blue one emits at 490&amp;nbsp;nm. Strontium aluminate can be formulated to phosphoresce at longer (yellow to red) wavelengths as well, though such emission is often dimmer than that of more common phosphorescence at shorter wavelengths.

For europium-dysprosium doped aluminates, the peak emission wavelengths are 520&amp;nbsp;nm for SrAl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, 480&amp;nbsp;nm for SrAl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;, and 400&amp;nbsp;nm for SrAl&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;19&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Katsumata|first1=Tooru|last2=Sasajima|first2=Kazuhito|last3=Nabae|first3=Takehiko|last4=Komuro|first4=Shuji|last5=Morikawa|first5=Takitaro|title=Characteristics of Strontium Aluminate Crystals Used for Long-Duration Phosphors|journal=Journal of the American Ceramic Society|date=20 January 2005|volume=81|issue=2|pages=413–416|doi=10.1111/j.1151-2916.1998.tb02349.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eu&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;,Dy&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;:SrAl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; is important as a persistently luminiscent phosphor for industrial applications. It can be produced by [[molten salt]] assisted process at 900&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rojas-Hernandez|first1=Rocío Estefanía|last2=Rubio-Marcos|first2=Fernando|last3=Gonçalves|first3=Ricardo Henrique|last4=Rodriguez|first4=Miguel Ángel|last5=Véron|first5=Emmanuel|last6=Allix|first6=Mathieu|last7=Bessada|first7=Catherine|last8=Fernandez|first8=José Francisco|title=Original Synthetic Route To Obtain a SrAlO Phosphor by the Molten Salt Method: Insights into the Reaction Mechanism and Enhancement of the Persistent Luminescence|journal=Inorganic Chemistry|date=19 October 2015|volume=54|issue=20|pages=9896–9907|doi=10.1021/acs.inorgchem.5b01656}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most described kind is the stoichiometric green-emitting (approx. 530&amp;nbsp;nm) Eu&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;:SrAl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;. Eu&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;,Dy&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;,B:SrAl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; shows significantly longer afterglow than the europium-only doped material. The Eu&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; dopant shows high afterglow, while Eu&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; has almost none. Polycrystalline Mn:SrAl&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;19&lt;/sub&gt; is used as a green phosphor for [[plasma display]]s, and when doped with [[praseodymium]] or [[neodymium]] it can act as a good [[active laser medium]]. Sr&lt;sub&gt;0.95&lt;/sub&gt;Ce&lt;sub&gt;0.05&lt;/sub&gt;Mg&lt;sub&gt;0.05&lt;/sub&gt;Al&lt;sub&gt;11.95&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;19&lt;/sub&gt; is a phosphor emitting at 305&amp;nbsp;nm, with [[quantum efficiency]] of 70%. Several strontium aluminates can be prepared by the [[sol-gel]] process.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.matsc.ktu.lt/index.php/MatSc/article/viewFile/2670/3153&lt;/ref&gt;

The wavelengths produced depend on the internal [[crystal structure]] of the material. Slight modifications in the manufacturing process (the type of reducing atmosphere, small variations of [[stoichiometry]] of the reagents, addition of [[carbon]] or [[rare-earth]] [[halide]]s) can significantly influence the emission wavelengths.

Strontium aluminate phosphor is usually fired at about 1250&amp;nbsp;°C, though higher temperatures are possible. Subsequent exposure to temperatures above 1090&amp;nbsp;°C is likely to cause loss of its phosphorescent properties. At higher firing temperatures, the Sr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; undergoes transformation to SrAl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Liu|first1=Yun|last2=Xu|first2=Chao-Nan|title=Influence of Calcining Temperature on Photoluminescence and Triboluminescence of Europium-Doped Strontium Aluminate Particles Prepared by Sol−Gel Process|journal=The Journal of Physical Chemistry B|date=May 2003|volume=107|issue=17|pages=3991–3995|doi=10.1021/jp022062c}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The glow intensity depends on the particle size; generally, the bigger the particles, the better the glow.

Strontium aluminate based afterglow pigments are marketed under brand names like MX24, ProFx and StarmakerFX from [https://www.megsglowmix.com Meg's Glowmix], GloMania[https://www.glomania.com ][https://www.gloeffex.com GLO Effex][https://www.artnglow.com/collections/glow-in-the-dark-powder Art 'N Glow], Core Glow,&lt;ref&gt;coreglow.ca&lt;/ref&gt;   Ambient Glow Technology or AGT.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ambientglowtechnology.com/|title=Glow Stone Dust - Glow Rock - Glowing Concrete - Ambient Glow Technology|publisher=|accessdate=3 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;   [[Super-LumiNova]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rctritec.com/index.php?id=13|title=RC TRITEC Ltd. : Swiss Super-LumiNova®|publisher=|accessdate=3 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nemoto.co.jp/en/products/luminova/index.html Nemoto &amp; Co., Ltd LumiNova] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080517010332/http://www.nemoto.co.jp/en/products/luminova/index.html |date=2008-05-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or NoctiLumina.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.noctilumina.com/|title=NoctiLumina® Luminizing Kits|publisher=|accessdate=3 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Strontium aluminate doped with [[europium]] and [[dysprosium]] is called [[Lumibrite]] developed by [[Seiko]] and claimed to be brighter and longer glow time compare to ordinary strontium aluminate doped with only europium.

Europium-doped strontium aluminate [[nanoparticle]]s are proposed as indicators of stress and cracks in materials, as they emit light when subjected to mechanical stress ([[mechanoluminescence]]). They are also useful for fabricating mechano-optical nanodevices. Non-agglomerated particles are needed for this purpose; they are difficult to prepare conventionally but can be made by ultrasonic spray pyrolysis of a mixture of [[strontium acetylacetonate]], [[aluminium acetylacetonate]] and [[europium acetylacetonate]] in reducing atmosphere (argon with 5% of hydrogen).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.ie/books?id=mfctkdOuz7MC&amp;pg=PA61&amp;dq=strontium+aluminate&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjP0cvbp8vJAhWBPhQKHdNTDTEQ6AEITDAJ#v=onepage&amp;q=strontium%20aluminate&amp;f=false|title=Progress in Nanotechnology|publisher=|accessdate=3 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cerium]] and manganese doped strontium aluminate (Ce,Mn:SrAl&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;19&lt;/sub&gt;) shows intense narrowband (22&amp;nbsp;nm wide) phosphorescence at 515&amp;nbsp;nm when excited by ultraviolet radiation (253.7&amp;nbsp;nm mercury emission line, to lesser degree 365&amp;nbsp;nm). It can be used as a phosphor in fluorescent lamps for e.g. [[photocopier]]s. A small amount of silicon substituting the aluminium can increase emission intensity by about 5%; the preferred composition of the phosphor is Ce&lt;sub&gt;0.15&lt;/sub&gt;Mn&lt;sub&gt;0.15&lt;/sub&gt;:SrAl&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt;Si&lt;sub&gt;0.75&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;19&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;http://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/pdfs/US3836477.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structural material==
Strontium aluminate [[cement]] (SrAl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, or SrO.Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) can be used as [[refractory]] structural material. It can be prepared by [[sintering]] of a blend of [[strontium oxide]] or [[strontium carbonate]] with [[alumina]], in a roughly equimolar ratio, at about 1500&amp;nbsp;°C. It can be used as a cement for [[refractory concrete]] for temperatures up to 2000&amp;nbsp;°C. [[Barium aluminate]] cement has similar characteristics, and can be furthermore used as [[radiation shielding]]. The use of barium and especially strontium aluminate cements is limited by the availability of the raw materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.ie/books?id=p6YTKgk8mBgC&amp;pg=PA177&amp;dq=strontium+aluminate&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjP0cvbp8vJAhWBPhQKHdNTDTEQ6AEIRjAI#v=onepage&amp;q=strontium%20aluminate&amp;f=false|title=Special Inorganic Cements|publisher=|accessdate=3 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Strontium aluminates are examined as proposed materials for immobilization of [[fission product]]s of [[radioactive waste]], namely the [[strontium-90]].&lt;ref&gt;https://inldigitallibrary.inl.gov/sti/4655305.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Up to now, various methods have been developed for the '''synthesis of bioglass''' and its composites including conventional [[Melt (manufacturing)|melt]] [[Quenching|quench]], [[sol–gel]], flame synthesis and microwave irradiation. [[Bioglass]] synthesis has been reviewed by various groups. In this section we will majorly focus on sol-gel synthesis of bioglass composites, which is the highly efficient technique for bioglass composites for tissue engineering applications.

== Melt quench synthesis ==
The first bioactive glass was developed by Hench in 1969 through melting mixture of the related oxide precursors at relatively high temperatures. The original bioactive glass was melt-derived (46.1&amp;nbsp;mol%, SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, 24.4&amp;nbsp;mol%, Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, 26.9&amp;nbsp;mol% CaO, and 2.6&amp;nbsp;mol% P&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;) and was named Bioglass®.The choice of the glass composition for a specific application should be based on a firm knowledge on the influence of all major components on the most relevant properties of the glass with regard to both the final use and the manufacture of the product. Despite extensive research during the past 40 years, only a few glass compositions have been accepted for clinical use. The two US Food and Drug Administration FDA approved melt-derived compositions 45S5 and S53P4 consist of four oxides: SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, CaO and P&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;Hench, L.L. &amp; Paschall, H.A.

J Non-Cryst Solids 2010;356:517-24.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the influence of the composition on the properties and compatibility of bioactive and biodegradable glasses is not fully understood.

The scaffolds fabricated by melt quench technique have very less porosity which causes healing and defects in tissue integration during in-vivo testing.

== Sol–gel process ==
The sol–gel process has a long history of use for synthesis of silicate systems and other oxides and it has become a widely spread research field with high technological relevance, for example for the fabrication of thin films, coatings, nanoparticles and fibers. Sol-gel processing technology at low temperatures, an alternative to traditional melt processing of glasses, involves the synthesis of a solution (sol), typically composed of metal-organic and metal salt precursors followed by the formation of a gel by chemical reaction or aggregation, and lastly thermal treatment for drying, organic removal, and sometimes crystallization and cooling treatment. The synthesis of specific silicate bioactive glasses by the sol–gel technique at low temperatures using metal alkoxides as precursors was shown in 1991 by Li et al.&lt;ref&gt;Li R, Clark AE, Hench LL. An Investigation of Bioactive Glass Powders by Sol- Gel Processing. J App Biomater 1991;2(4):231-239.&lt;/ref&gt; For the synthesis of bioactive glasses, typical precursors used are tetraethyl orthosilicate, calcium nitrate and triethylphosphate. After hydrolysis and poly-condensation reactions a gel is formed which subsequently is calcinated at 600–700°C to form the glass. Based on the preparation method, sol–gel derived products, e.g. thin films or particles are highly porous exhibiting a high specific surface area. Recent work on fabricating bioactive silicate glass nanoparticles by sol–gel process has been carried out by Hong et al.&lt;ref&gt;Hong Z, Liu A, Chen L, Chen X, Jing X. Preparation of bioactive glass ceramic nanoparticles by combination of sol-gel and coprecipitation method. J Non- Cryst Solids 2009;355(6):368-372&lt;/ref&gt; In their research, nanoscale bioactive glass particles were obtained by the combination of two steps; sol–gel route and co-precipitation method, wherein the mixture of precursors was hydrolyzed in acidic environment and condensed in alkaline condition separately, and then followed by a freeze-drying process. The morphology and size of bioactive glass nanoparticles could be tailored by varying the production conditions and the feeding ratio of reagents.

Different ions can be added to bioactive glasses, such as zinc, magnesium, zirconium, titanium, boron, and silver in order to improve the glass functionality and bioactivity. However, it is usually difficult to synthesize bioactive glasses in nano-size scale with addition of those ions. More recently, Delben et al. have developed sol–gel-derived bioactive glass doped with silver and reported that the Si–O–Si bond number increased with increasing silver concentration and this resulted in structural densification.&lt;ref&gt;Delben JRJ, Pimentel OM, Coelho MB, Candelorio PD, Furini LN, Santos FA, Vicente FS, Delben AAST. Synthesis and thermal properties of nanoparticles of bioactive glasses containing silver. J Therm Anal Calorim 2009;97:433–436.&lt;/ref&gt; It was also observed that quartz and metallic silver crystallization increased with the increase in silver content in bioactive glass while hydroxyapatite crystallization decreased.

There is wide agreement about the versatility of the sol–gel technique to synthesize inorganic materials and it has been shown to be suitable for production of a variety of bioactive glasses. However, the method is also limited in terms of compositions that can be produced. Moreover remaining water or residual solvent content may result in complications of the method for the intended biomedical applications of the nanoparticles or nanofibres produced. Usually a high temperature calcination step is required to eliminate organics remnants. In addition, sol–gel processing is relatively time consuming and since it is not a continuous process, batch-to-batch variations may occur.

== Microwave synthesis ==
Recently ultrasonic assisted synthesis and microwave assisted synthesis is gaining attention as they can help to reaction in a short time and can modify the reaction environment to produce nano phase powders. It is a rapid and low cost powder synthesis method for powders.For synthesis, the precursors were dissolved in de-ionized water and transferred to the ultrasonic bath. The irradiation time was varied to obtain the optimum synthesis condition. Microwave operation was performed in a second batch of powders after the ultrasonic irradiation. The obtained amorphous powder was washed in de-ionized water and filtered. After drying for 24 hours in oven at 80°C the powders were calcined at 700°C temperatures for the development of bioglass.&lt;ref&gt;Bioceramics Development and Applications Vol. 1 (2011), Article ID D110155,  doi:10.4303/bda/D110155&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Tour de Sol''' in Switzerland was the first rally for [[solar vehicles|solar powered vehicles]]. It was carried out annually from 1985 to 1993. The first event started on June 25 in Romanshorn on the Lake of Constance, and finished on June 30 in Geneva. 72 vehicles started in two classes; over 50 finished. The vehicles were powered exclusively by direct onboard solar power in addition to an initial charge of the onboard accumulators. The second class also allowed direct human power with pedals. The rally was conceived as a kind of race with the winners being those using the least time to travel the set course each day. The course was on unclosed public roads and the drivers were required to adhere all traffic rules and speed limits. The first events were very popular with thousands of spectators lining the roads and visiting the camps where the vehicles stopped each day. In later years the fastest vehicles also raced on round-circuit closed-off courses each day after arriving at the stops. From 1990 the organisers also held separate events called Tour de Sol Alpine. These included closed courses on frozen lakes and snowy roads and on unclosed mountain passes.

After a few years other organisers carried out similar rallies, e.g. the American Tour de Sol. In 1988 the Tour de Sol also held the first race for [[Electric boat#Types|solar powered boats]] on July 1 at Estavayer-le-Lac.

The Tour de Sol initially stipulated direct solar power from onboard [[solar cells]]. After the first couple of events, a class was introduced which allowed charging accumulators from stationary solar panels and swapping accumulators. Later another class also allowed charging from the 230 VAC mains, provided that this amount of electricity was generated elsewhere by solar power and fed into the mains. This led to the development of the first domestic grid-feed systems.

The legal form of the Tour de Sol was a foundation. It ceased in 2002. Solar engineer Josef Jenni is credited as the inventor of the event and Urs Muntwyler developed and led it for most of its years.

The course of the first Tour de Sol was relatively flat and direct, in later years the courses were circuitous and included mountain passes.
*1985: Romanshorn - Geneva
*1986: Freiburg (Germany) - Suhr
*1987: Biel - Arosa
*1988: Zürich - Etoy
*1989: Rheinfelden - Locarno
*1990: Schaffhausen - Münsingen
*1990: Tour de Sol Alpine (on snow): Lenzerheide-Valbella (dito in 1991)
*1991: Suhr - Beatenberg (total altitude gain 5000 m)
*1991: Tour de Sol Alpine (on roads): Laax - St. Moritz
*1992: Pforzheim (Germany) - Saas Fee
*1993: Luzern - Adelboden

==Regulations==
The detailed regulations for the vehicles were described in a 24-page handbook. The main specifications for the vehicles were for the size of the solar cells and the accumulator battery. The racing category allowed a panel up to 6 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; or 480 Watts peak and a battery capacity of up to 4.8 kWh. These vehicles were checked by the police and got temporary licences for the duration of the event. For vehicles with a regular road licence other specifications applied.

==Two-wheelers==
The vehicles mostly had three or four wheels but from the beginning a few bicycles with solar trailers participated. This later led to the development of Swiss production electric bicycles and motorcycles.

The '''Waste Incineration Directive''', more formally Directive 2000/76/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council
of 4 December 2000 on the incineration of waste (OJ L332, P91 – 111), was a [[European Union directive|Directive]] issued by the [[European Union]] and relates to standards and methodologies required by Europe for the practice and technology of [[incineration]]. The aim of this Directive is to minimise the impact of negative environmental effects on the environment and human health resulting from [[Flue gas|emissions]] to air, soil, surface and ground water from the incineration and co-incineration of waste. The requirements of the Directive were developed to reflect the ability of modern incineration plants to achieve high standards of emission control more effectively.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.defra.gov.uk/environment/ppc/envagency/pubs/index.htm The Waste Incineration Directive] [[Pollution, Prevention and Control]], [[Defra]]&lt;/ref&gt; The Directive was replaced by the [[Industrial Emissions Directive]] with effect from 7 January 2014&lt;ref&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/environment/industry/stationary/index.htm European Commission:Prevention and control of industrial emissions.]&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''Waste broker''' is someone within the waste industry who acts as [[intermediary|middle man]] between other waste industry parties. They are required to be registered with the [[Environment Agency]].

==Waste Broker==
The client would typically have some [[rubbish]] (trash) to take away, and rather than ring round a few contractors in the area they ring the Waste Broker, and give them all the details of what they want. This Broker person or organisation will have a list of those contractors in the area, and it is they who will do the ringing round or emailing, to see who is available to do the client's pickup.

==Trade Broker (a type of Waste Broker)==
The client might be a producer of recycled materials, and want to sell them. They will contact a Trade Broker who performs a similar function.
Usually the Waste Broker is local or at most national, but the Trade Broker could be arranging shipments between countries.
