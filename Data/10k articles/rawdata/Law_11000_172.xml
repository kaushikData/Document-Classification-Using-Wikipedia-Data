'''Admiralty law''' or '''maritime law''' is a body of [[law]] that governs nautical issues and private maritime disputes. Admiralty law consists of both domestic law on maritime activities, and [[Conflict of laws|private international law]] governing the relationships between private parties operating or using ocean-going ships. While each legal jurisdiction usually has its own legislation governing maritime matters, the international nature of the topic and the need for uniformity has, since 1900, led to considerable international maritime law developments, including numerous multilateral treaties.&lt;ref&gt;... such as the [[COLREGS]], [[SOLAS Convention|SOLAS]], [[Hague-Visby Rules]], [[International Ship and Port Facility Security Code|ISPS]], etc.&lt;/ref&gt;

Matters dealt by admiralty law include marine commerce, [[marine navigation]], [[marine salvage|salvage]], [[maritime pollution]], [[sailor|seafarers’ rights]], and the [[Contract of carriage|carriage]] by sea of both passengers and [[Freight transport|goods]]. Admiralty law also covers land-based commercial activities that are maritime in character, such as marine insurance. Some lawyers prefer to reserve the term “admiralty law” for “wet law” (e.g. salvage, collisions, ship arrest, towage, liens, &amp; limitation), and use “maritime law” only for “dry law” (e.g. carriage of goods &amp; people, [[marine insurance]], and the [[Maritime Labour Convention|MLC]]).&lt;ref&gt;... but note the title of the 3rd edition of Aleka Madaraka-Sheppard’s book “Admiralty Law” has become “Maritime Law”&lt;/ref&gt;

Admiralty law may be distinguished from the [[Law of the Sea]], which is a body of [[public international law]] dealing with navigational rights, [[mineral rights]], jurisdiction over coastal waters, and the maritime relationships between nations. The [[United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea]] has been adopted by 167 countries&lt;ref&gt; ... but not the USA.&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[European Union]], and disputes are resolved at the [[ITLOS]] tribunal in Hamburg.

==History==
Seaborne transport was one of the earliest channels of commerce, and rules for resolving disputes involving maritime trade were developed early in recorded history. Early historical records of these laws include the [[Rhodian law]] (Nomos Rhodion Nautikos), of which no primary written specimen has survived, but which is alluded to in other legal texts (Roman and Byzantine legal codes), and later the customs of the [[Consulate of the Sea]] or the [[Hanseatic League]]. In southern Italy the [[Ordinamenta et consuetudo maris]] (1063) at [[Trani]] and the [[Amalfian Laws]] were in effect from an early date.

[[Henry de Bracton|Bracton]] noted further that admiralty law was also used as an alternative to the common law in Norman England, which previously required voluntary submission to it by entering a plea seeking judgment from the court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=De Legibus et Consuetudinibus Angliae|url=http://www.law.harvard.edu/programs/ames_foundation/bracton.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sharia|Islamic law]] also made major contributions to international admiralty law,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Islamic Maritime Law&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; An Introduction | author = Khalilieh, Hassan Salih |publisher=[[Leiden]], [[Netherlands]]:  [[Brill Publishers]]|year=1998|isbn=978-90-04-10955-1|ref=harv|postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt; departing from the previous [[Roman law|Roman]] and [[Byzantine law|Byzantine]] maritime laws in several ways. These included [[Islamic economics in the world#Age of discovery|Muslim sailors]] being paid a fixed [[wage]] "in advance" with an understanding that they would owe money in the event of [[desertion]] or [[malfeasance]], in keeping with Islamic conventions in which contracts should specify "a known fee for a known duration." (In contrast, Roman and Byzantine [[sailor]]s were "stakeholders in a maritime venture, inasmuch as captain and crew, with few exceptions, were paid proportional divisions of a sea venture's profit, with shares allotted by rank, only after a voyage's successful conclusion.") Muslim jurists also distinguished between "coastal navigation, or ''[[cabotage]]''", and voyages on the "[[high seas]]", and they made shippers "[[liable]] for [[freight]] in most cases except the [[Search and seizure|seizure]] of both a [[ship]] and its [[cargo]]". Islamic law "departed from Justinian's ''[[Pandects|Digest]]'' and the ''[[Nomos Rhodion Nautikos]]'' in condemning slave jettison", and the Islamic ''[[Qirad]]'' was a precursor to the European ''commenda'' [[limited partnership]]. The "Islamic influence on the development of an international law of the sea" can thus be discerned alongside that of the Roman influence.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=Emily Sohmer|last=Tai|title=Book Review: Hassan S. Khalilieh, ''Admiralty and Maritime Laws in the Mediterranean Sea (ca. 800-1050): The "Kitāb Akriyat al-Sufun" vis-à-vis the "Nomos Rhodion Nautikos"''| journal=Medieval Encounters| volume=13| year=2007| pages=602–12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A leading sponsor of  admiralty law in Europe was the French [[Eleanor of Aquitaine| Queen Eleanor of Aquitaine]]. Eleanor (sometimes known as "Eleanor of Guyenne”) had learned about admiralty law whilst on a [[Crusades|crusade]] in the eastern Mediterranean with her first husband, King [[Louis VII of France]]. Eleanor then established admiralty law on the island of [[Oleron]], where it was published as the "[[Rolls of Oleron]]".  Some time later, while she was in London acting as [[regent]] for her son, King [[Richard I of England|Richard the Lionheart]], Eleanor instituted admiralty law into England as well.

In England, a special [[admiralty court|Admiralty Court]] handles all admiralty cases. Despite early reliance upon [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] concepts derived from the [[Corpus Juris Civilis]] of [[Justinian I|Justinian]], the English Admiralty Court is very much a [[common law]] court, albeit a ''[[sui generis]]'' tribunal initially somewhat distanced from other English courts. After around 1750, as the [[industrial revolution]] took hold and English maritime commerce burgeoned, the Admiralty Court became a proactive source of innovative legal ideas and provisions to meet the new situation. The [[Judicature Act]]s of 1873-1875 abolished the Admiralty Court as such, and it became conflated in the new "Probate, Divorce &amp; Admiralty" division of the High Court. However, when the PDA was abolished and replaced by a new "Family Division", admiralty jurisdiction passed to a so-called "Admiralty Court" which was effectively the [[High Court of Justice#Queens Bench Division|QBD]] sitting to hear nautical cases. The [[Senior Courts Act 1981]] then clarified the "admiralty jurisdiction of the High Court", so England once again has a distinct Admiralty Court (albeit no longer based in the [[Royal Courts of Justice]], but in the [[Rolls Building]]).  

English Admiralty courts were a prominent feature in the prelude to the [[American Revolution]].  For example, the phrase in the Declaration of Independence "For depriving us in many cases, of the benefits of Trial by Jury" refers to the practice of the UK Parliament giving the Admiralty Courts jurisdiction to enforce The [[Stamp Act]] in the American Colonies.&lt;ref&gt;See the Stamp Act, March 22, 1765, D. Pickering, Statutes at Large, Vol. XXVI, p. 179 ff (clause LVII relates to jurisdiction in admiralty).&lt;/ref&gt; This power has been awarded because the Stamp Act was unpopular in America, so that a colonial jury would be [[Jury nullification|unlikely to convict]] any colonist of its violation. However, since English admiralty courts have never had trial by jury, a colonist charged with breaching the Stamp Act could be more easily convicted by the Crown.{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}}

Admiralty law became part of the law of the United States as it was gradually introduced through admiralty cases arising after the adoption of the [[United States Constitution|U.S. Constitution]] in 1789.  Many American lawyers who were prominent in the American Revolution were admiralty and maritime lawyers in their private lives.  Those included are [[Alexander Hamilton]] in [[New York (state)|New York]] and [[John Adams]] in [[Massachusetts]].

In 1787 [[John Adams]], who was then [[United States Ambassador to France|ambassador to France]], wrote to [[James Madison]] proposing that the U.S. Constitution, then under consideration by the States,  be amended to include "trial by jury in all matters of fact triable by the laws of the land [as opposed the law of admiralty] and not by the laws of Nations [i.e. not by the law of admiralty]". The result was the [[Seventh Amendment to the United States Constitution|Seventh Amendment to the U.S. Constitution]].  Alexander Hamilton and John Adams were both admiralty lawyers and Adams represented [[John Hancock]] in an admiralty case in colonial Boston involving seizure of one of Hancock's ships for violations of Customs regulations. In the more modern era, Supreme Court Justice [[Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.|Oliver Wendell Holmes]] was an admiralty lawyer before ascending to the bench.

===Maintenance and cure===
The doctrine of maintenance and cure is rooted in Article VI of the [[Rolls of Oleron]] promulgated in about 1160 A.D. The obligation to "cure" requires a shipowner to provide medical care free of charge to a [[Seaman (Admiralty Law)|seaman]] injured in the service of the ship, until the seaman has reached "maximum medical cure". The concept of "maximum medical cure" is more extensive than the concept "maximum medical improvement". The obligation to "cure" a seaman includes the obligation to provide him with medications and medical devices which improve his ability to function, even if they don't "improve" his actual condition. They may include long term treatments that permit him to continue to function well. Common examples include prostheses, wheelchairs, and pain medications.

The obligation of "maintenance" requires the shipowner to provide a seaman with his basic living expenses while he is convalescing.  Once a seaman is able to work,  he is expected to maintain himself.  Consequently,  a seaman can lose his right to maintenance,  while the obligation to provide cure is ongoing.

A seaman who is required to sue a shipowner to recover maintenance and cure may also recover his attorneys fees.  ''[[Vaughan v. Atkinson]]'', 369 U.S. 527 (1962). If a shipowner's breach of its obligation to provide maintenance and cure is willful and wanton, the shipowner may be subject to punitive damages.  See ''[[Atlantic Sounding Co. v. Townsend]]'', 557 U.S. 404 (2009)(J. Thomas).

===Personal injuries to passengers===
{{main|Negligence}}
Shipowners owe a [[Breach of duty in English law|duty of reasonable care]] to passengers. Consequently, passengers who are injured aboard ships may bring suit as if they had been injured ashore through the negligence of a third party. The passenger bears the burden of proving that the shipowner was negligent. While personal injury cases must generally be pursued within three years,  suits against cruise lines may need to be brought within one year because of limitations contained in the passenger ticket. Notice requirements in the ticket may require a formal notice to be brought within six months of the injury. Most U.S. cruise line passenger tickets also have provisions requiring that suit to be brought in either [[Miami]] or [[Seattle]].

In [[English law|England]], the 1954 case of ''Adler v Dickson (The Himalaya)'' [1954]&lt;ref&gt;''Adler v Dickson'' [1954] 2 LLR 267, [1955] 1 QB 158 [http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/1954/3.html]&lt;/ref&gt; allowed a shipping line to escape liability when a bosun's negligence resulted in a passenger being injured. Since then, the [[Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977]] has made it unlawful to exclude liability for death or personal injury caused by one's negligence. (Since then, however, the so-called "[[Himalaya clause]]" has become a useful way for a contractor to pass on the protection of a limitation clause to his employees, agents and third-party contractors).

===Maritime liens and mortgages===
{{See also|Maritime lien}}

Banks which loan money to purchase ships, vendors who supply ships with necessaries like fuel and stores, seamen who are due wages, and many others have a [[lien]] against the ship to guarantee payment. To enforce the lien, the ship must be arrested or seized. In the United States, an action to enforce a lien against a U.S. ship must be brought in federal court and cannot be done in state court, except for under the [[Erie Doctrine|reverse-''Erie'' doctrine]] whereby state courts can apply federal law.

===Salvage and treasure salvage===
{{See also|Marine salvage}}

When property is lost at sea and rescued by another, the rescuer is entitled to claim a salvage award on the salvaged property. There is no "life salvage". All mariners have a duty to save the lives of others in peril without expectation of reward. Consequently, salvage law applies only to the saving of property.

There are two types of salvage: contract salvage and pure salvage, which is sometimes referred to as "merit salvage". In contract salvage the owner of the property and salvor enter into a salvage contract prior to the commencement of salvage operations and the amount that the salvor is paid is determined by the contract. The most common salvage contract is called a "[[Lloyd's Open Form|Lloyd's Open Form Salvage Contract]]".

In pure salvage, there is no contract between the owner of the goods and the salvor. The relationship is one which is implied by law. The salvor of property under pure salvage must bring his claim for salvage in court, which will award salvage based upon the "merit" of the service and the value of the salvaged property.

Pure salvage claims are divided into "high-order" and "low-order" salvage. In high-order salvage, the salvor exposes himself and his crew to the risk of injury and loss or damage to his equipment to salvage the damaged ship. Examples of high-order salvage are boarding a sinking ship in heavy weather, boarding a ship which is on fire, raising a ship or boat which has already sunk, or towing a ship which is in the surf away from the shore. Low-order salvage occurs where the salvor is exposed to little or no personal risk. Examples of low-order salvage include towing another vessel in calm seas, supplying a vessel with fuel, or pulling a vessel off a sand bar. Salvors performing high order salvage receive substantially greater salvage award than those performing low order salvage.

In both high-order and low-order salvage the amount of the salvage award is based first upon the value of the property saved. If nothing is saved, or if additional damage is done, there will be no award.  The other factors to be considered are the skills of the salvor, the peril to which the salvaged property was exposed, the value of the property which was risked in effecting the salvage, the amount of time and money expended in the salvage operation etc.

A pure or merit salvage award will seldom exceed 50 percent of the value of the property salved. The exception to that rule is in the case of treasure salvage. Because sunken treasure has generally been lost for hundreds of years, while the original owner (or insurer, if the vessel was insured) continues to have an interest in it, the salvor or finder will generally get the majority of the value of the property.  While sunken ships from the [[Spanish Main]] (such as ''[[Nuestra Señora de Atocha]]'' in the [[Florida Keys]]) are the most commonly thought of type of treasure salvage, other types of ships including German submarines from World War II which can hold valuable historical artifacts, [[American Civil War]] ships (the USS ''Maple Leaf'' in the [[St. Johns River]], and the [[CSS Virginia|CSS ''Virginia'']] in [[Chesapeake Bay]]), and sunken merchant ships (the [[SS Central America|SS ''Central America'']] off [[Cape Hatteras]]) have all been the subject of treasure salvage awards.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} Due to refinements in side-scanning sonars, many ships which were previously missing are now being located and treasure salvage is now a less risky endeavor than it was in the past,  although it is still highly speculative and expensive.

==International conventions==
Prior to the mid-1970s, most international conventions concerning maritime trade and commerce originated in a private organization of maritime lawyers known as the [[Comité Maritime International]] (International Maritime Committee or CMI). Founded in 1897, the CMI was responsible for the drafting of numerous international conventions including the Hague Rules (International Convention on Bills of Lading),  the Visby Amendments (amending the Hague Rules),  the Salvage Convention and many others.  While the CMI continues to function in an advisory capacity,  many of its functions have been taken over by the [[International Maritime Organization]], which was established by the [[United Nations]] in 1958 but did not become truly effective until about 1974.

The IMO has prepared numerous international conventions concerning maritime safety including the [[International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea]] (SOLAS), the Standards for Training, Certification, and Watchkeeping ([[STCW]]),  the [[International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea]] (Collision Regulations or COLREGS), Maritime Pollution Regulations ([[MARPOL]]), [[Search and rescue|International Aeronautical and Maritime Search and Rescue Convention]] (IAMSAR) and others.  The [[United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea]] (UNCLOS) defined a treaty regarding protection of the marine environment and various [[maritime boundary|maritime boundaries]]. Restrictions on international fishing such as [[International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling]] also form part of the body of conventions in international waters. Other commercial conventions include the "International Convention relating to the Limitation of the Liability of Owners of Sea-Going Ships", [[Brussels]], 10 October 1957.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www3.austlii.edu.au/au/other/dfat/treaties/1981/2.html “International Convention relating to the Limitation of the Liability of Owners of Sea-Going Ships, and Protocol of Signature. ATS 2 of 1981”]. Australasian  Legal Information Institute, Australian Treaties Library. Retrieved on 15 April 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[International Convention for Safe Containers]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www3.austlii.edu.au/au/other/dfat/treaties/1981/3.html “International Convention for Safe Containers. ATS 3 of 1981”]. Australasian  Legal Information Institute, Australian Treaties Library.&lt;/ref&gt;

Once adopted, most international conventions are enforced by the individual signatory nations, either through their [[Port State Control]], or through their national courts. Cases within the ambit of the [[European Union]]'s [[European Maritime Safety Agency|EMSA]] may be heard by the [[Court of Justice of the European Union|CJEU]] in [[Luxembourg]]. By contrast, disputes involving the Law of the Sea may be resolved at [[ITLOS]] in [[Hamburg]], provided that the parties are signatories to [[United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea|UNCLOS]].

==Piracy==
{{Main|Piracy}}
Merchant vessels transiting areas of increased pirate activity (i.e. the [[Gulf of Aden]], [[Somali Basin]], Southern [[Red Sea]] and [[Bab-el-Mandeb straits]]) are advised to implement Self-Protective measures in accordance with most recent ''Best Management Practices'' agreed upon by the members of the merchant industry, and endorsed by the NATO Shipping Centre, and the Maritime Security Centre Horn-of-Africa (MSCHOA)&lt;ref&gt;NATO Shipping Centre (www.shipping.nato.int)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Individual countries==
[[Common law]] legal systems of Britain and the United States are in contrast to [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] legal systems which prevail in continental Europe and trace back to old Roman codified law. Although England's admiralty law was a development of continental civil law, its admiralty courts were common law courts, albeit somewhat distanced from the mainstream [[Kings Bench Division|Kings Bench]].

Most of the common law countries (including [[Pakistan]], [[Singapore]], [[India]], and many other [[Commonwealth of Nations]] countries) follow English statute and case law. India still follows many Victorian-era British statutes such as the Admiralty Court Act 1861 [24 Vict c 10]. Whilst Pakistan now has its own statute, the Admiralty Jurisdiction of High Courts Ordinance, 1980 (Ordinance XLII of 1980), it also follows English case law. One reason for this is that the 1980 Ordinance is partly modelled on old English admiralty law, namely the Administration of Justice Act 1956. The current statute dealing with the Admiralty jurisdiction of the England and Wales High Court is the Supreme Court Act 1981, ss. 20-24, 37. The provisions in those sections are, in turn, based on the International Arrest Convention 1952. Other countries which do not follow the English statute and case laws, such as [[Panama]], also have established well-known maritime courts which decide international cases on a regular basis.

Admiralty courts assume jurisdiction by virtue of the presence of the vessel in its territorial jurisdiction irrespective of whether the vessel is national or not and whether registered or not, and wherever the residence or domicile or their owners may be. A vessel is usually arrested by the court to retain jurisdiction. State-owned vessels are usually immune from arrest.

===Canada===
{{Main|Canadian maritime law}}

Canadian jurisdiction in the area of "Navigation and Shipping" is vested in the [[Parliament of Canada]] by virtue of s. 91(10) of the ''[[Constitution Act, 1867]]''.

Canada has adopted an expansive definition of its maritime law, which goes beyond traditional admiralty law. The original English admiralty jurisdiction was called "wet", as it concerned itself with things done at sea, including collisions, salvage and the work of mariners, and contracts and torts performed at sea. Canadian law has added "dry" jurisdiction to this field, which includes such matters as:

* [[stevedoring]],
* [[marine insurance]],
* [[warehousing]] and security services,
* contracts of [[agency (law)|agency]], and
* contracts of [[affreightment|carriage]].

This list is not exhaustive of the subject matter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author = John G. O'Connor |title = Why the Full Extent of the Admiralty Jurisdiction of the Federal Courts has yet to be explored | url= http://www.cmla.org/papers/AdmiraltyJurisdictionoftheFederalCourts.pdf | date = 2004-11-05 | accessdate = 2011-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Canadian jurisdiction was originally consolidated in 1891, with subsequent expansions in 1934 following the passage of the ''[[Statute of Westminster 1931]]'', and in 1971 with the extension to "dry" matters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=John G. O'Connor |title=Admiralty Jurisdiction and Canadian Maritime Law in the Federal Courts: The next forty years |url=http://www.fca-caf.gc.ca/bulletins/whatsnew/03E.%20OConnor_Maritime%20Law%20Jurisdiction_2011-10-17_ENG.pdf |date=2011-10-28 |accessdate=2012-05-25 }}{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent jurisprudence at the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] has tended to expand the maritime law power, thus overriding prior provincial laws based on the provinces' power over [[property and civil rights]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Christopher J. Giaschi |title=The Constitutional implications of ''Ordon v. Grail'' and the expanding definition of Canadian maritime law |url=http://www.admiraltylaw.com/papers/Dalspeech.htm |date=2000-10-03 |accessdate=2012-01-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110319234559/http://www.admiraltylaw.com/papers/Dalspeech.htm |archivedate=2011-03-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
{{Main|United States admiralty law}}

====Jurisdiction====
[[Article Three of the United States Constitution|Article III, Section 2]] of the [[United States Constitution]] grants original jurisdiction to [[U.S. federal court]]s over admiralty and maritime matters;  however, that jurisdiction is not exclusive, and most maritime cases can be heard in either state or federal courts under the "saving to suitors" clause.&lt;ref&gt;{{UnitedStatesCode|28|1333}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are five types of cases which can only be brought in federal court:

*  Limitation of Shipowner's Liability,
*  Vessel Arrests ''in Rem'',
*  Property arrests ''Quasi in Rem'',
*  Salvage cases, and
* Petitory and Possession Actions.

The common element of those cases are that they require the court to exercise jurisdiction over maritime property. For example, in a Petitory and Possession Action, a vessel whose title is in dispute, usually between co-owners, will be put in the possession of the court until the title dispute can be resolved.  In a Limitation Action, the shipowner will post a bond reflecting the value of the vessel and her pending freight. A sixth category, that of [[prize (law)]], relating to claims over vessels captured during wartime, has been rendered obsolete due to changes in the laws and practices of warfare.

Aside from those five types of cases, all other maritime cases, such as claims for personal injuries, cargo damage, collisions, maritime products liability, and recreational boating accidents may be brought in either federal or state court.

From a tactical standpoint it is important to consider that in federal courts in the United States, there is generally no right to trial by jury in admiralty cases, although the [[Merchant Marine Act of 1920|Jones Act]] grants a jury trial to seamen suing their employers.

Maritime law is governed by a uniform three-year statute of limitations for personal injury and wrongful death cases.  Cargo cases must be brought within two years (extended from the one-year allowance under the [[Hague-Visby Rules]]), pursuant to the adoption of the [[Rotterdam Rules]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rotterdamrules.com/en/interpretation/ ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120309181839/http://www.rotterdamrules.com/en/interpretation/ |date=March 9, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Most major cruise ship passenger tickets have a one-year statute of limitations.

====Applicable law====
A state court hearing an admiralty or maritime case is required to apply the admiralty and maritime law,  even if it conflicts with the law of the state,  under a doctrine known as the "reverse-Erie doctrine". While the "[[Erie doctrine]]" requires that federal courts hearing state actions must apply substantive state law, the "reverse-Erie doctrine" requires state courts hearing admiralty cases to apply substantive federal admiralty law. However, state courts are allowed to apply state procedural law.&lt;ref&gt;[http://docs.law.gwu.edu/stdg/gwlr/issues/pdf/Oliveri-76-5.pdf ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100613120809/http://docs.law.gwu.edu/stdg/gwlr/issues/pdf/Oliveri-76-5.pdf |date=June 13, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This change can be significant.

====Features of U.S. admiralty law====

=====[[Freight claim|Cargo claims]]=====
Claims for damage to cargo shipped in international commerce are governed by the [[Carriage of Goods by Sea Act]] (COGSA), which is the U.S. enactment of the Hague Rules. One of its key features is that a shipowner is liable for cargo damaged from "hook to hook",  meaning from loading to discharge, unless it is exonerated under one of 17 exceptions to liability, such as an "[[act of God]]", the inherent nature of the goods, errors in [[navigation]], and management of the ship. The basis of liability for the shipowner is a [[bailment]] and if the carrier is to be liable as a [[common carrier]], it must be established that the goods were placed in the carrier's possession and control for immediate carriage.&lt;ref&gt;Robinson, Gustavus H. (1939). Handbook of Admiralty Law in the United States. Hornbook Series. St. Paul, Minn.: West Publishing Co. p. 439&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Personal injuries to seamen=====
[[Seaman (Admiralty Law)|Seamen]] injured aboard ship have three possible sources of compensation: the principle of maintenance and cure, the doctrine of unseaworthiness, and the [[Merchant Marine Act of 1920|Jones Act]]. The principle of maintenance and cure requires a shipowner to both pay for an injured seaman's medical treatment until maximum medical recovery (MMR) is obtained and provide basic living expenses until completion of the voyage, even if the seaman is no longer aboard ship.

The [[European Patent Convention]] (EPC), the multilateral [[treaty]] instituting the legal system according to which European patents are granted, contains provisions allowing a party to appeal a decision issued by a first instance department of the [[European Patent Office]] (EPO). For instance, a decision of an Examining Division refusing to [[Grant procedure before the European Patent Office|grant a European patent application]] may be appealed by the applicant. The '''appeal procedure before the European Patent Office''' is under the responsibility of its Boards of Appeal, which are institutionally independent within the EPO.

== Overview ==
[[File:Europäisches Patentamt in München.jpg|thumb|right|280px|EPO headquarters in [[Munich]], Germany]] 
Decisions of the first instance departments of the [[European Patent Office]] (EPO) can be appealed, i.e. challenged, before the Boards of Appeal of the EPO, in a [[judiciary|judicial]] procedure (proper to an administrative court), as opposed to an [[public administration|administrative]] procedure.&lt;ref&gt;"In decision G 1/99 (OJ 2001, 381) the Enlarged Board held that the appeal procedure is to be considered as a judicial procedure (see G 9/91, OJ 1993, 408, point 18 of the Reasons) proper to an administrative court (see G 8/91, OJ 1993, 346, point 7 of the Reasons; likewise G 7/91, OJ 1993, 356)." in {{EPO Case law book|iv|e|1}}: "Legal character of appeal procedure".&lt;/ref&gt; These boards act as the final instances in the [[grant procedure before the European Patent Office|granting]] and [[opposition procedure before the European Patent Office|opposition]] procedures before the EPO. The Boards of Appeal have been recognised as courts, or tribunals, of an international organisation, the EPO.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archive.epo.org/epo/pubs/oj009/05_09/05_3069.pdf G 2/06, Reasons 4], Official Journal EPO 5/2009 page 318 par. 4: "Whereas EPO Boards of Appeal have been recognized as being courts or tribunals, they are not courts or tribunals of an EU member state but of an international organization whose contracting states are not all members of the EU."&lt;/ref&gt;

The Boards of Appeal of the EPO, including the Enlarged Board of Appeal, are based at the headquarters of the EPO in [[Munich]], Germany. This contrasts with the Examining Divisions and Opposition Divisions, the first instance departments carrying the examination of patent applications and of oppositions to granted European patents, which may be in Munich, in [[Rijswijk]] (a suburb of [[The Hague]], [[Netherlands]]), or in [[Berlin]], Germany.

In October 2017, the Boards of Appeal moved to [[Haar, Bavaria|Haar]], a municipality located 12 km east of Munich's city centre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epo.org/service-support/contact-us/boards-of-appeal-new-location.html|title=New location for the Boards of Appeal|year=2017|publisher=European Patent Office|accessdate=1 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epo.org/news-issues/news/2017/20171002.html|title=Boards of Appeal starting work at their new location|date=2 October 2017|publisher=European Patent Office|accessdate=6 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Enlarged Board of Appeal===
In addition to the Boards of Appeal, the European Patent Office has an "Enlarged Board of Appeal" (sometimes abbreviated "EBoA" or "EBA"). This board does not constitute an additional level of jurisdiction in the classical sense. The Enlarged Board of Appeal, which is fundamentally a legal instance in charge of deciding on [[points of law]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video |people=Kevin Garnett QC |date= 23–24 March 2011 |title=Case law of the EPO boards of appeal: a review by internal and external experts, The Enlarged Board of Appeal: structure and function, its rules of procedure, pending referrals, the procedure for petition for review under Article 112a EPC with an overview of relevant decisions, Part 2: The first two functions of the EBoA |url=https://e-courses.epo.org/wbts/caselaw_en/a001_popups_proc3_proc3_pres_b2video.html |publisher=European Patent Office |location=Munich, Germany |accessdate=5 August 2012|minutes=0:50 to 1:15}}&lt;/ref&gt; has four functions, as follows.

The first two functions of the Enlarged Board of Appeal are to make decisions or to issue opinions when the [[case law]] of the Boards of Appeal becomes inconsistent or when an important point of law arises, either upon a referral from a Board of Appeal (first function of the Enlarged Board of Appeal), in which case the Enlarged Board issues a decision, or upon a referral from the President of the EPO (second function of the Enlarged Board of Appeal), in which case the Enlarged Board issues an opinion. Its purpose is "to ensure uniform application of the law" and to clarify or interpret important points of law in relation to the European Patent Convention.&lt;ref&gt;{{EPC Article|112|1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The referral of a question of law by a Board of Appeal to the Enlarged Board of Appeal is fairly similar to a referral by a national court to the [[European Court of Justice]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video |people=Kevin Garnett QC |date= 23–24 March 2011 |title=Case law of the EPO boards of appeal: a review by internal and external experts, The Enlarged Board of Appeal: structure and function, its rules of procedure, pending referrals, the procedure for petition for review under Article 112a EPC with an overview of relevant decisions, Part 2: The first two functions of the EBoA |url=https://e-courses.epo.org/wbts/caselaw_en/a001_popups_proc3_proc3_pres_b2video.html |publisher=European Patent Office |location=Munich, Germany |accessdate=5 August 2012|minutes=7:32 to 7:45}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The third function of the Enlarged Board of Appeal is to examine [[Petition for review under the European Patent Convention|petitions for review]] of decisions of the Boards of Appeal.&lt;ref&gt;{{EPC Article|112a|5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The third function is relatively recent. It is indeed only since December 2007 and the entry into force of the [[EPC 2000]], the revised [[European Patent Convention]], that a petition for review of a decision of a Board may be filed,&lt;ref&gt;{{EPC Article|112a|1}}&lt;/ref&gt; albeit on limited grounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{EPC Article|112a|2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fourth function is to propose the removal from office of a member of the boards of appeal. Under Article 23(1) EPC, a member of the Enlarged Board or of a Board of Appeal may not be removed from office during the five-year term of appointment, other than on serious grounds and if the "Administrative Council, on a proposal from the Enlarged Board of Appeal, takes a decision to this effect."&lt;ref&gt;{{EPC Article|23|1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Enlarged Board has been [[Art._23_1/15,_Art._23_2/15_and_Art._23_1/16|requested on three occasions]] to propose the removal from office of the same Board member, but did so in none of these cases.

===Organisational structure, and supervision===
The Boards of Appeal, the Enlarged Board of Appeal, as well as their registries and support services, form a separate unit within the European Patent Office, the so-called "Boards of Appeal Unit".&lt;ref name="r-12a.1"&gt;{{EPC Rule|12a|1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="2018-se1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epo.org/law-practice/legal-texts/official-journal/2018/etc/se1.html|title=Supplementary publication 1, Official Journal 2018, Information from the Boards of Appeal Presidium, business distribution and texts relating to the proceedings|date=January 2018|publisher=European Patent Office|pages=2 (Note to readers)|accessdate=4 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is directed by the President of the Boards of Appeal,&lt;ref name="r-12a.1"/&gt; a position held as of 2018 by former Swedish Judge [[Carl Josefsson (judge)|Carl Josefsson]].&lt;ref name="2018-se1"/&gt; The President of the Boards of Appeal is also the chairperson of the Enlarged Board of Appeal.&lt;ref name="r-12a.1"/&gt; The "Presidium of the Boards of Appeal" is the autonomous authority within the Boards of Appeal Unit, and consists of the President of the Boards of Appeal and twelve members of the Boards of Appeal,&lt;ref&gt;{{EPC Rule|12b|1}}&lt;/ref&gt; elected by their peers.&lt;ref&gt;{{EPC Rule|12b|2}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Furthermore, a "Boards of Appeal Committee" has been set up by the [[Administrative Council of the European Patent Organisation]] to adopt the Rules of Procedure of the Boards of Appeal (and of the Enlarged Board of Appeal), and to assist the Administrative Council in supervising the Boards of Appeal.&lt;ref name="r-12c"&gt;{{EPC Rule|12c}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="2018-se1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epo.org/about-us/governance/administrative-council/bodies/boards-of-appeal-committee.html|title=Boards of Appeal Committee|publisher=European Patent Office|accessdate=4 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Boards of Appeal Committee consists of six members, three of whom are members of the Administrative Council itself (i.e. representatives of the Contracting States within the meaning of {{EPC Article|26}}) and the remaining three are "serving or former judges of international or European courts or of national courts of the Contracting States".&lt;ref name="r-12c"/&gt;

The current organisational and managerial structure of the Boards of Appeal resulted from a reform undertaken by the Administrative Council as a reaction to Enlarged Board of Appeal decision [[R 19/12]] of 25 April 2014.&lt;ref name="K.Klett-2017"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Klett|first=Kathrin|year=2017|title=Neuorganisation der Beschwerdekammern in der Europäischen Patentorganisation|trans-title=Reorganisation of the Boards of Appeal in the European Patent Organisation|journal=sic!|issue=03|page=119|language=German|url=https://www.sic-online.ch/fileadmin/user_upload/Sic-Online/2017/documents/119.pdf|accessdate=4 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Baldan|first1=Federica|last2=Van Zimmeren|first2=Esther|year=2015|title=Exploring Different Concepts of Judicial Coherence in the Patent Context: The Future Role of the (New) Unified Patent Court and its Interaction with other (Old) Actors of the European Patent System|journal=Review of European Administrative Law|issue=8|pages=377–408|doi=10.7590/187479815X14465419060785|quote=In particular, organisational and managerial reforms for a separation of the judiciary from the executive branches of the EPOrg were required following decision R 19/12 of the Enlarged Board of Appeal (EBoA) of 25 April 2014 (...)}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reform was undertaken by the Administrative Council "within the existing framework of the European Patent Convention, without requiring its revision."&lt;ref name="2018-se1"/&gt;{{#tag:ref|A revision of the European Patent Convention necessitates a Conference of the Contracting States, see {{EPC Article|172}}.|group=notes}}

== Procedure ==
An appeal may be filed against a decision of a first instance department of the EPO, i.e. a decision of the Receiving Section, of an Examining Division, of an Opposition Division or of the Legal Division.&lt;ref name="r.106-1"&gt;{{EPC Article|106|1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Boards of Appeal are not competent, however, to review decisions taken by the EPO acting as international authority under the [[Patent Cooperation Treaty]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.epo.org/law-practice/case-law-appeals/recent/j150010du1.html|title=J 0010/15 (PCT Anmeldung) of 30.1.2018|date=30 January 2018|publisher=Legal Board of Appeal of the European Patent Office|language=German|at=Entscheidungsgründe, 2|quote=Auch nach ständiger Rechtsprechung sind die Beschwerdekammern grundsätzlich nicht zuständig, um die vom EPA als internationale Behörde getroffenen Entscheidungen zu überprüfen (J 14/98, Nr. 2.1 der Entscheidungsgründe; J 20/89, Nr. 2 der Entscheidungsgründe, ABl. 1991, 375; J 15/91, Nr. 2 der Entscheidungsgründe).|accessdate=12 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most appeals are filed (i.e., lodged) against decisions of Examining Divisions and Opposition Divisions, with a relatively small number of cases being appeals against decisions of the Receiving Section and Legal Division.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video |people=Yvonne Podbielski |date=8–9 November 2012 |title=EPO boards of appeal and key decisions, The appeal procedure from A to Z (Part 1 of 3) |url=https://e-courses.epo.org/wbts/caselaw2012/index.html|publisher=European Patent Office |location=Munich, Germany |accessdate=30 June 2013|minutes=0:51 to 1:58}}&lt;/ref&gt; An appeal has a suspensive effect,&lt;ref name="r.106-1"/&gt; which means that, for example, "[i]n the case of a refusal of an application, the filing of an appeal will have the effect of suspending the effect of the order refusing the application".&lt;ref&gt;[http://archive.epo.org/epo/pubs/oj012/10_12/10_5162.pdf Decision J 4/11 of 25 November 2011], Reasons 14.&lt;/ref&gt; The provisions applicable to the first instance proceedings from which the appeal derives also apply during appeal proceedings, "[u]nless otherwise provided."&lt;ref&gt;{{EPC Rule|100|1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Possible interlocutory revision in ''ex parte'' proceedings ===
If an appeal is lodged against a decision in ''ex parte'' proceedings (i.e., proceedings involving only one party) and if the first instance department which took the decision regards the appeal to be admissible and well founded, it has to rectify its decision. This is a so-called "interlocutory revision",&lt;ref&gt;{{EPC Article|109|1}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is said to be a rather unusual procedure within the EPO.&lt;ref name="Podbielski"&gt;{{cite video |people=Yvonne Podbielski |date=8–9 November 2012 |title=EPO boards of appeal and key decisions, The appeal procedure from A to Z (Part 3 of 3) |url=https://e-courses.epo.org/wbts/caselaw2012/index.html |publisher=European Patent Office |location=Munich, Germany |accessdate=7 July 2013|minutes=1:30 to 3:03}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is a very useful procedure for example if amendments are filed with the appeal, which clearly overcome the objections in the first instance decision.&lt;ref name="Podbielski"/&gt; If the appeal is not allowed by the first instance department within three months of receipt of the statement of grounds, the first instance department has to transfer the case to the Board of Appeal without delay, and without comment as to its merit.&lt;ref&gt;{{EPC Article|109|2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Admissibility and allowability ===
For an appeal to be admissible,&lt;ref&gt;{{EPC Rule|101|1}}, previously {{EPC 1973 Rule|65}}.&lt;/ref&gt; amongst other requirements, notice of appeal must be filed at the EPO within two months of notification of the contested decision, and the fee for appeal must be paid. In addition, within four months of notification of the decision, a statement setting out the grounds of appeal (i.e., the appeal grounds) must be filed,&lt;ref&gt;{{EPC Article|108}}. Regarding the calculation of the two-month deadline for filing the notice of appeal and paying the appeal fee, see also [http://ipkitten.blogspot.com/2009/04/epc-ten-day-rule-how-not-to-use-it.html ''The EPC "Ten Day Rule" – how not to use it''], [[IPKat]] blog, 27 April 2009, referring to [http://legal.european-patent-office.org/dg3/biblio/t082056eu1.htm Board of Appeal decision T 2056/08 of 15 January 2009].&lt;/ref&gt; which must contain the appellant's complete case.&lt;ref&gt;Article 12(2) RPBA&lt;/ref&gt; The appellant must also be adversely affected by the appealed decision.&lt;ref&gt;{{EPC Article|107}}&lt;/ref&gt; A party is only adversely affected by an appealed decision if the order of the appealed decision does not comply with its request (i.e. what the party requested during the first instance proceedings).&lt;ref&gt;"A party is only adversely affected if the order of the appealed decision does not comply with its request." in [http://www.epo.org/law-practice/case-law-appeals/pdf/t070193eu1.pdf Decision T 0193/07 of 11 May 2011], Reasons for the Decision 2.1.2, first sentence; "A party is adversely affected if a decision does not accede to its requests (established jurisprudence; see T 961/00 of 9 December 2002, point 1 of the Reasons)" in [http://www.epo.org/law-practice/case-law-appeals/pdf/t080109eu1.pdf decision T 0109/08 of 27 January 2012], Reasons for the Decision, 3.2, second sentence.&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, when "the order of the decision of the opposition division is the revocation of the patent, an opponent who requested revocation of the patent in its entirety is not "adversely affected by" said decision... irrespective of the reasons given in the decision."&lt;ref&gt;Decision T 0193/07, Reasons for the Decision 2.3, referring to "decisions T 0854/02 of 14 October 2002 (points 3.1 and 3.2 of the reasons), decisions T 0981/01 of 24 November 2004 (points 5 and 6 of the reasons), T 1147/01 of 16 June 2004 (point 2 of the reasons), T 1341/04 of 10 May 2007 (points 1.2(i) and 1.3 of the reasons) and T 0473/98 (points 2.2 to 2.8 of the reasons)."&lt;/ref&gt;

The admissibility of an appeal may be assessed at every stage of the appeal proceedings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |opinion=Decision T 15/01 (Mystery Swine Disease/SDLO) |pinpoint=reasons, point 1 |court=Technical Board of Appeal 3.3.04 |date=17 June 2004|url=http://www.epo.org/law-practice/case-law-appeals/recent/t010015ep1.html |accessdate=9 March 2014|quote=(...) admissibility issues can and have to be examined at every stage of the appeal procedure. According to established case law, the admissibility of an opposition must be checked ex officio in every phase of the opposition and ensuing appeal proceedings (T 522/94, point 3, OJ EPO 1998, 421). The same principles apply a fortiori to the examination of the admissibility of an appeal.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the requirements for admissibility must not only be satisfied when lodging the appeal, they must be sustained throughout the duration of the appeal proceedings.&lt;ref&gt;"''The requirements for admissibility must be sustained throughout the duration of the appeal proceedings (see Singer/Stauder, EPÜ, 4th ed., Art. 110, margin number 6), i.e. approximately until a decision is issued in written proceedings or delivered at the end of oral proceedings.''" in [http://www.european-patent-office.org/epo/pubs/oj008/12_08/12_5678.pdf Decision of the Legal Board of Appeal dated 31 March 2008, J 10/07 – 3.1.01], Official Journal EPO 12/2008, p. 567, reasons 1.2., 2nd paragraph.&lt;/ref&gt; If the appeal is admissible, the Board of Appeal examines whether the appeal is allowable,&lt;ref&gt;{{EPC Article|110}}&lt;/ref&gt; i.e. the Board addresses the [[merits of the case]].

After examining the allowability of an appeal,&lt;ref&gt;{{EPC Article|111|1|first sentence}}&lt;/ref&gt; a Board has the discretion to either "exercise any power within the competence of the department which was responsible for the decision appealed" (correction of a decision) or "remit the case to that department for further prosecution" (cassation of a decision).&lt;ref&gt;{{EPC Article|111|1|second sentence}}&lt;/ref&gt; When a board remits a case to the first instance, it does so notably to give the parties the possibility of defending their case before two instances, i.e. at two levels of jurisdiction,&lt;ref&gt;[http://legal.european-patent-office.org/dg3/pdf/t060154eu1.pdf Decision T 154/06] of 11 January 2008, Reasons 7.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="case-law-iv-e-7-2-1"&gt;{{EPO Case law book|iv|e|7|2|1}}: "Opposition appeal proceedings".&lt;/ref&gt; although "there is no absolute right to have an issue decided upon by two instances."&lt;ref name="case-law-iv-e-7-6-1"&gt;{{EPO Case law book|iv|e|7|6|1}}: "No absolute right to have issue decided on by two instances".&lt;/ref&gt; The boards generally take into account as well the need for procedural efficiency when deciding whether to remit a case to the first instance&lt;ref name="case-law-iv-e-7-2-1"/&gt; and "the general interest that proceedings are brought to a close within an appropriate period of time".&lt;ref name="case-law-iv-e-7-6-1"/&gt;

=== Accelerated processing ===
Parties with a legitimate interest may request accelerated processing of the appeal proceedings.&lt;ref name="acceleration"&gt;[http://www.european-patent-office.org/epo/pubs/oj008/04_08/04_2208.pdf ''Notice from the Vice-President Directorate-General 3 dated 17 March 2008 concerning accelerated processing before the boards of appeal''], [[Official Journal of the EPO]] 4/2008, pp 220–221.&lt;/ref&gt; Courts and competent authorities of the contracting states may also request accelerated processing.&lt;ref name="acceleration"/&gt; Exceptionally the Board of Appeal may itself decide to accelerate the proceedings, ''ex officio'', "for example in view of the disadvantages which could ensue from the suspensive effect of the appeal in the case in question".&lt;ref name="acceleration"/&gt;

=== Oral proceedings ===
During an appeal, oral proceedings may take place at the request of the EPO or at the request of any party to the proceedings, i.e. the applicant (who is, in pre-grant appeal, the appellant), or the patentee or an opponent (who are, in opposition appeal,&lt;ref&gt;A patentee may also be the sole appellant in an ''ex parte'' appeal proceedings following a decision of an Examining Division in [[Limitation and revocation procedures before the European Patent Office|limitation and revocation proceedings]]. Decisions of an Examining Division in such proceedings are open to appeal (OJ 2007, Special edition 4/2007, page 118, item 6, and Articles 106(1) and 21 EPC).&lt;/ref&gt; appellant or respondent).&lt;ref&gt;{{EPC Article|116|1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The oral proceedings in appeal are held in Munich, and are public unless very particular circumstances apply.&lt;ref&gt;{{EPC Article|116|4}}&lt;/ref&gt; This contrasts with oral proceedings held before an Examining Division, which are not public.&lt;ref&gt;{{EPC Article|116|3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The list of public oral proceedings in appeal before the EPO is available on its web site.&lt;ref&gt;EPO web site, [http://www.epo.org/applying/online-services/proceedings.html ''Oral proceedings calendar'']. Consulted on 28 October 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; The right to oral proceedings is a specific and codified part of the procedural right to be heard.&lt;ref&gt;"The right to oral proceedings according to Article 116 EPC is a specific and codified part of the procedural right to be heard according to Article 113(1) EPC." in Decision [http://legal.european-patent-office.org/dg3/biblio/t031012eu1.htm T 1012/03] of 1 December 2006, Reasons 25.&lt;/ref&gt; A decision is most often taken at the end of the oral proceedings, since the purpose of oral proceedings is to come to a conclusion on a case.&lt;ref&gt;Article 15(6) RPBA&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video |people=Giovanni Pricolo |date= 23–24 March 2011 |title=Case law of the EPO boards of appeal: a review by internal and external experts, Oral proceedings before the EPO boards of appeal, Part 2: Before the oral proceedings  |url=https://e-courses.epo.org/wbts/caselaw_en/a001_popups_proc2_proc2_presentations_b2video.html |publisher=European Patent Office |location=Munich, Germany |accessdate=5 August 2012|minutes=3:05 to 3:25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Substantial procedural violation and reimbursement of the appeal fee ===
The EPC provides that, if the Board of Appeal finds out that a substantial procedural violation took place during the first instance proceedings and if the Board considers the appeal to be allowable, the appeal fee shall be reimbursed if such reimbursement is equitable.&lt;ref&gt;{{EPC Rule|103|1|a}} (formerly {{EPC 1973 Rule|67}}). See also Article 11 RPBA, relating to the remission of a case to the first instance in the event of a fundamental deficiency amounting to a substantial procedural violation "unless special reasons present themselves for doing otherwise".&lt;/ref&gt;

A substantial procedural violation may for instance occur during the first instance proceedings if the right of the parties to be heard were violated ({{EPC Article|113|1}}) or if the first instance decision was not properly reasoned ({{EPC Rule|111|2}}&lt;ref&gt;formerly {{EPC 1973 Rule|68|2}}&lt;/ref&gt;). To be properly reasoned, "a decision must contain, in logical sequence, those arguments which justify its order"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epo.org/law-practice/case-law-appeals/recent/t050689eu1.html Decision T 689/05 of 7 September 2010], point 4.1. See also [http://www.epo.org/law-practice/case-law-appeals/pdf/t090306eu1.pdf decision T 0306/09 of 25 April 2012], reasons 2: 
:"According to established jurisprudence of the boards of appeal, to satisfy the requirement of Rule 111(2) EPC, a decision should contain, in logical sequence, those arguments which support it. The conclusions drawn by the deciding body from the facts and evidence must be made clear. Therefore, all the facts, evidence and arguments which are essential to the decision must be discussed in detail in the decision including all the decisive considerations in respect of the factual and legal aspects of the case. The purpose of the requirement to reason the decision is to enable the parties and, in case of an appeal, also the board of appeal to examine whether the decision could be considered to be justified or not (see T 278/00, OJ EPO, 2003, 546; T 1366/05, not published in OJ EPO)".
&lt;/ref&gt; "so as to enable the parties and, in case of an appeal, the board of appeal to examine whether the decision was justified or not".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epo.org/law-practice/case-law-appeals/recent/t121205eu1.html Decision T 1205/12 (Optimization of decisions/LANDMARK GRAPHICS) of 14 December 2012], Reasons 1.2.&lt;/ref&gt;

More generally, a substantial procedural violation is "an objective deficiency affecting the entire proceedings".&lt;ref&gt;{{EPO Case law book|iv|e|8|4|1}}: "Definition [of a substantial procedural violation]"&lt;/ref&gt; The expression "substantial procedural violation" is to be understood, in principle, as meaning "that the rules of procedure have not been applied in the manner prescribed by the [European Patent] Convention."&lt;ref&gt;{{EPO Case law book|iv|e|8|4|1|a}}: "Violation must be of procedural nature"&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Reimbursement of the appeal fee under certain circumstances when the appeal is withdrawn ===
The appeal fee is reimbursed in full "if the appeal is withdrawn before the filing of the statement of grounds of appeal and before the period for filing that statement has expired."&lt;ref&gt;{{EPC Rule|103|1|a}}&lt;/ref&gt; Besides, 50% of the appeal fee is reimbursed if the appeal is withdrawn after expiry of the period for filing the statement of grounds of appeal, but if withdrawal occurs in any of the cases specified in {{EPC Rule|103|2|a), (b) and (c}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{EPC Rule|103|2}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Board of Appeal 3.3.05, such a reimbursement of 50% of the appeal fee is only to be made if "a procedural declaration [is made] that leaves no doubt that withdrawal of the appeal is intended".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epo.org/law-practice/case-law-appeals/pdf/t131402eu2.pdf T 1402/13] of 31 May 2016, Catchword 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Binding character of decisions ==
The legal system established under the EPC differs from a [[common law]] legal system in that "[it] does not treat (...) established [[jurisprudence]] as binding."&lt;ref&gt;[http://legal.european-patent-office.org/dg3/pdf/t980740eu1.pdf T 740/98], Reasons 2.3&lt;/ref&gt; Under the EPC, there is no principle of binding case law.&lt;ref name="T 1099/06"&gt; [http://legal.european-patent-office.org/dg3/pdf/t061099eu1.pdf T 1099/06], Reasons 1.&lt;/ref&gt; That is, the binding effect of board of appeal decisions is extremely limited.&lt;ref name="T 1099/06"/&gt;

A decision of a Board of Appeal is only binding on to the department whose decision was appealed, insofar as the facts are the same (if the case is remitted to the first instance of course).&lt;ref&gt;{{EPC Article|111|2|first sentence}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, "[if] the decision which was appealed emanated from the Receiving Section, the Examining Division shall similarly be bound by the [[ratio decidendi]] of the Board of Appeal."&lt;ref&gt;{{EPC Article|111|2|second sentence}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, if "a Board consider[s] it necessary to deviate from an interpretation or explanation of the [EPC] given in an earlier decision of any Board, the grounds for this deviation shall be given, unless such grounds are in accordance with an earlier opinion or decision of the Enlarged Board of Appeal."&lt;ref&gt;Article 20(1) RPBA&lt;/ref&gt;

A decision of the Enlarged Board of Appeal (pursuant to {{EPC Article|112|1|a}}) is only binding on the Board of Appeal in respect of the appeal in question, i.e. on the Board of Appeal which referred the question to the Enlarged Board of Appeal.&lt;ref&gt;{{EPC Article|112|3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, in the event that a Board considers it necessary to deviate from an opinion or decision of the Enlarged Board of Appeal, a question must be referred to the Enlarged Board of Appeal.&lt;ref&gt;Article 21 RPBA&lt;/ref&gt;

Outside the European Patent Office, the decisions of the Boards of Appeal are not strictly binding on national courts, but they certainly have a persuasive authority.&lt;ref&gt;Lord Hoffmann in ''Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals v Norton'' [1996] RPC 76 at 82: "… the United Kingdom Courts … must have regard to the decisions of the European Patent Office ("EPO") on the construction of the EPC. These decisions are not strictly binding upon courts in the United Kingdom but they are of great persuasive authority; first, because they are decisions of expert courts (the Boards of Appeal and Enlarged Board of Appeal of the EPO) involved daily in the administration of the EPC and secondly, because it would be highly undesirable for the provisions of the EPC to be construed differently in the EPO from the way they are interpreted in the national courts of a Contracting State."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="messerli-2011-03(2)"&gt;{{cite video |people=Peter Messerli |date= 23–24 March 2011 |title=Case law of the EPO boards of appeal: a review by internal and external experts, Opening address |url=https://e-courses.epo.org/wbts/caselaw_en/a001_popups_scon_scon_pres_opening.html |publisher=European Patent Office |location=Munich, Germany |accessdate=3 August 2012|minutes=2:16 to 4:01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Independence of the members of the Boards of Appeal ==
The members of the Boards of Appeal and of the Enlarged Board of Appeal are appointed by the Administrative Council of the European Patent Organisation on a proposal from the President of the European Patent Office.&lt;ref&gt;{{EPC Article|11|3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="messerli-2011-03(1)"&gt;{{cite video |people=Peter Messerli |date= 23–24 March 2011 |title=Case law of the EPO boards of appeal: a review by internal and external experts, Opening address |url=https://e-courses.epo.org/wbts/caselaw_en/a001_popups_scon_scon_pres_opening.html |publisher=European Patent Office |location=Munich, Germany |accessdate=3 August 2012|minutes=1:19 to 2:16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, during their five-year term, the Board members may only be removed from office under exceptional circumstances.&lt;ref name="messerli-2011-03(1)"/&gt;&lt;ref name="23-1"&gt;{{EPC Article|23|1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Sir Robin Jacob]], the members of the Boards of Appeal are "judges in all but name".&lt;ref&gt;Sir Robin Jacob, ''National Courts and the EPO Litigation System'', [[GRUR Int.]] 2008, Vol. 8–9, pages 658–662, referring to what he said in ''Lenzing's Appn.'' [1997] RPC 245 at p. 277 and repeated in ''Unilin v. Berry'' [2007] EWCA Civ. 364. See also Leith, P, "Judicial and Administrative Roles: the patent appellate system in a European Context", Intellectual Property Quarterly, Issue 1, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; They are only bound by the [[European Patent Convention]].&lt;ref&gt;{{EPC Article|23|3}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are not bound by any instructions, such as the "Guidelines for Examination in the European Patent Office". They have a duty of independence.&lt;ref name="23-1"/&gt;

However, since "the [appeal] boards' administrative and organisational attachment to the EPO which is an administrative authority obscures their judicial nature and is not fully commensurate with their function as a judicial body",&lt;ref name="patent-reform"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110303055418/http://www.epo.org/law-practice/legislative-initiatives/autonomy.html|title=Autonomy of the boards of appeal|date=2004-2006|work=Legislative initiatives &gt; Organisational autonomy of the boards of appeal|publisher=European Patent Office|accessdate=6 February 2018|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110303055418/http://www.epo.org/law-practice/legislative-initiatives/autonomy.html|archivedate=3 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; there have been calls for creating, within the European Patent Organisation, a third judicial body alongside the Administrative Council and the European Patent Office. This third judicial body would replace the present Boards of Appeal and could be called the "''Court of Appeals of the European Patent Organisation''"&lt;ref&gt;[[Standing Advisory Committee before the European Patent Office]] (SACEPO), [https://web.archive.org/web/20050409091536/http://www.ficpi.org/library/singaporeCET/CET-1404annex.pdf ''Organisational autonomy of the Boards of Appeal of the European Patent Office within the European Patent Organisation''] 6 June 2003 (pdf), archived on 9 April 2005 by the [[Internet Archive]].&lt;/ref&gt; or the "''European Court of Patent Appeals''".&lt;ref name="patent-reform"/&gt; This third body would have his own budget, would have its seat in Munich, Germany and would be supervised "without prejudice to its judicial independence" by the Administrative Council of the EPO.&lt;ref name="patent-reform"/&gt; The EPO has also proposed that the members of the Boards of Appeal should be appointed for lifetime, "with grounds for termination exhaustively regulated in the EPC".&lt;ref name="patent-reform"/&gt; These changes would however need to be approved by a new Diplomatic Conference.&lt;ref name="messerli-2011-03(3)"&gt;{{cite video |people=Peter Messerli |date= 23–24 March 2011 |title=Case law of the EPO boards of appeal: a review by internal and external experts, Opening address |url=https://e-courses.epo.org/wbts/caselaw_en/a001_popups_scon_scon_pres_opening.html |publisher=European Patent Office |location=Munich, Germany |accessdate=3 August 2012|minutes=4:52 to 6:17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to some experts, the calls to improve the institutional independence of the Boards of Appeal have not received so far the appropriate consideration by the Administrative Council of the European Patent Organisation.&lt;ref&gt;[[Joseph Straus]], [http://documents.epo.org/projects/babylon/eponet.nsf/0/9B36130E784D78FDC12577740054BFED/$File/g3-08_amicus_curiae_brief_Straus_J_Prof_Dr_en.pdf ''Re: Case No. G3/08, Referral of the President of the European Patent Office under Article 112 (1) (b) EPC of October 22, 2008, Statement According to Article 11 b Rules of Procedure of the Enlarged Board of Appeal''], Munich, 27 April 2009, and in particular, points 6.3.2 and 6.3.3: "''Since the Sedemund-Treiber/Ferrand Study was submitted to the Administrative Council of the European Patent Organisation, nothing has happened to improve the institutional independence of the Boards of Appeal. Rather, the opposite seems to be the case.''"&lt;/ref&gt; Echoing these concerns, the Enlarged Board of Appeal in its decision [[R 19/12]], with potentially far-reaching effects, regarded an objection of partiality against the Vice-President DG3 (Directorate-General Appeals) as justified on the grounds that he is acting both as chairman of the Enlarged Board of Appeal and as a member of the Management Committee of the EPO. The decision shows the persistent disquietude caused by the integration of the Boards of Appeal into the European Patent Office. This question, namely the question of the independence of the Boards of Appeal, was also raised by Spain "against the Regulations on the [[unitary patent]]" in cases [[C-146/13]] and [[C-147/13]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eplawpatentblog.com/eplaw/2014/05/epo-vice-president-dg3-as-chairman-of-the-enlarged-board-of-appeal-conflict-of-interests-between-the.html|title=EPO – Vice-president DG3 as Chairman of the Enlarged Board of Appeal – Conflict of interests between the tasks as member of the management and as a presiding judge in review cases|last=Teschemacher|first=Rudolf|date=5 May 2014|publisher=EPLAW Patent Blog|accessdate=12 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Baysayeva v. Russia''''' was an  April 5, 2007, [[European Court of Human Rights]] ruling in the case of [[forced disappearance]] of a [[Chechen people|Chechen]] man [[Shakhid Baysayev]], which unanimously held [[Russia]] responsible for serious violations of the [[European Convention on Human Rights]]. The decision was the latest in a series of judgements against Russia in cases connected to the war in [[Chechnya]].

In its unanimous judgment, the Court made a number of important findings:

*The [[Detention (imprisonment)|detention]] of Baysayev had been unlawful as Russian troops disregarded domestic legal procedures (Article 5 of the European Convention on Human Rights);
*Baysayev must be presumed dead considering circumstances of his detention and the fact that he has been missing for more than six years. The Court held that the Russian government is responsible for his death (Article 2);
*The [[Detective|investigation]] into the disappearance of Baysayev has been inadequate on numerous accounts (Article 2);
*The suffering of Baysayev's wife as a result of her husband's "disappearance" and the failure of the Russian government to take adequate steps to clarify his fate reaches the threshold of [[inhuman and degrading treatment]] (Article 3);
*The refusal of the Russian authorities to submit the documents of criminal investigation file constitutes a failure to assist the Court in its investigation (Article 38). 

The panel of seven [[judge]]s, which included the Russian judge, ordered Russia to pay the applicant Asmart Baysayeva 50,000 [[Euro]] in [[Damages|compensation]] for moral damages. The government was also obliged to take steps to properly investigate Baysayev’s disappearance. 

At the time of the ruling some 200 similar cases were pending before the [[Strasbourg]] court. An estimated 5,000 people have "disappeared" in Chechnya since the start of the [[Second Chechen War]] in 1999.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

[[Image:ReleasetheColombia3.JPG|thumb|right|A Sinn Féin poster calling for the men's release]]
The '''Colombia Three''' are three individuals – Niall Connolly, James Monaghan and Martin McCauley – who are currently living in the [[Republic of Ireland]], having fled from [[Colombia]], where they were sentenced to prison terms of seventeen years for training [[FARC]] rebels. The incident came during a crucial time in the [[Northern Ireland peace process]] and risked damaging it.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2001/aug/18/colombia.northernireland&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arrest==
The three came to prominence on 11 August 2001, when they were arrested travelling on false passports at [[Bogotá International Airport]] while waiting to transfer to international flights out of the country. The Colombian authorities alleged at the time that they were training [[FARC]] rebels and were members of the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army]] (IRA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Suspected IRA member charged in Colombia | url = http://www.rte.ie/news/2001/0815/ira.html | publisher = ''RTÉ'' | date = 15 August 2001 | accessdate = 12 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to General [[Fernando Tapias Stahelin]], the Colombian authorities were tipped off by "an international security organisation".&lt;ref name="mult2"&gt;{{cite news | title = Suspected IRA trio held in Colombia | url = https://www.theguardian.com/colombia/story/0,,630743,00.html | publisher = ''[[The Guardian]]'' | date = 14 August 2001 | accessdate = 12 February 2007 | location=London | first=Martin | last=Hodgson}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two of the three men, Monaghan and McCauley, had arrived in [[Colombia]] on 30 June 2001 on a flight from [[Belfast]], via Paris. Niall Connolly had flown from [[Dublin]], via [[Madrid]], and spent a day in [[Caracas]] before making a rendezvous in [[Bogotá]]. The three men then spent the next five weeks travelling through a demilitarised southern zone of Colombia, then under the control of the FARC rebels as part of peace talks with the Colombian government.&lt;ref name="mult1"/&gt; They were arrested as soon as they touched down in Bogotá on a commercial flight on the Saturday night.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Cuba link to Colombia IRA suspect | author = Daniel Schweimler | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/1496948.stm | publisher = ''[[BBC News]]'' | date = 17 August 2001 | accessdate = 12 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prosecution==
After the men's arrest at Bogota airport, they were only charged with travelling on false passports, until 15 February 2002, when they were also charged with training FARC rebels in bomb-making.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = 'IRA three' charged by Colombians | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/1825029.stm  | publisher = ''BBC News'' | date = 16 February 2002 | accessdate = 12 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a number of delays, including a boycott of proceedings by the three accused, the trial opened on 2 December 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Trial of IRA men begins today | author = Ruth Morris | url = https://www.theguardian.com/colombia/story/0,,852087,00.html  | publisher = ''The Guardian'' | date = 2 December 2002 | accessdate = 12 February 2007 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following a number of adjournments, the trial closed on 1 August 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Irish trio await Bogota verdict | author = Sibylla Brodzinsky | url = https://www.theguardian.com/colombia/story/0,,1011064,00.html | publisher = ''The Guardian'' | date = 2 August 2003 | accessdate = 12 February 2007 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; The trial judge returned a verdict which found the three men guilty of travelling on false passports and they were given varying sentences of up to 44 months. They were found not guilty on the more serious charges relating to training FARC rebels; however, the judge ordered their release upon payment of fines equivalent to £3,800.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Colombia clears IRA suspects | author = Sibylla Brodzinsky | url = https://www.theguardian.com/colombia/story/0,,1204238,00.html | publisher = ''The Guardian'' | date = 27 April 2004 | accessdate = 12 February 2007 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Appeal==
In accordance with Colombian law, the prosecution had the right to appeal the verdict, which it did. While awaiting appeal, the three men were free to leave jail, but were instructed by a judge to remain within the country. The appeal court overturned the original trial verdict, and convicted the men of training the rebels, sentencing them to seventeen years in jail on 16 December 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Irishmen in hiding jailed for 17 years | author = Sibylla Brodzinsky | url = https://www.theguardian.com/colombia/story/0,,1375729,00.html | publisher = ''The Guardian'' | date = 17 December 2004 | accessdate = 12 February 2007 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Return to Ireland==
The day after their conviction, the [[Attorney General of Colombia|Colombian Attorney General]] announced that the men had fled Colombia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Irish trio 'have fled Colombia' | author = Sibylla Brodzinsky | url = https://www.theguardian.com/colombia/story/0,,1376619,00.html | publisher = ''The Guardian'' | date = 18 December 2004 | accessdate = 12 February 2007 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 5 August 2005, following an interview with Monaghan by [[Raidió Teilifís Éireann|RTÉ]]'s [[Charlie Bird]], it emerged that the three men had clandestinely returned to Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Colombian 3 back in Ireland | author = Angelique Chrisafis | url = https://www.theguardian.com/colombia/story/0,,1543586,00.html | publisher = ''The Guardian'' | date = 6 August 2005 | accessdate = 12 February 2007 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; The three men were subsequently questioned by [[Garda Síochána|Gardaí]] but no moves have been taken in relation to extraditing them to Colombia, despite the existence of a Colombian [[arrest warrant]], since no extradition treaty or agreement exists between Colombia and Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Irish police question Colombia Three | author = Sophie Kirkham | url = https://www.theguardian.com/colombia/story/0,,1552015,00.html | publisher = ''The Guardian'' | date = 19 August 2005 | accessdate = 12 February 2007 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Interpol members told of warrant | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/4172421.stm | publisher = ''BBC News'' | date = 14 January 2005 | accessdate = 12 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Colombia Three==
===James Monaghan===
[[File:ColombiaThreeBadge.JPG|thumb|right|A badge calling for the release of the Colombia Three]]
James William Monaghan  was born on 9 August 1945, and is originally from [[County Donegal]] but his last known address was in [[Newry]], [[County Down]]. &lt;ref name="mult4"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mult5"&gt;{{cite web | title = Explosive Journey: Perceptions of Latin America in the FARC-IRA Affair (2001–2005) | author = Edmundo Murray | url = http://www.irlandeses.org/21stC1.htm | publisher = ''Society for Irish Latin American Studies'' | date = 1 March 2006 | accessdate = 13 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1970s he was believed to have been active in the IRA, gaining the nickname 'Mortar' on account of his skill in manufacturing [[barrack buster|homemade mortars]] and,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Globalizing Terrorism: The FARC-IRA Connection |author=Mark Burgess |url=http://www.cdi.org/terrorism/farc-ira-pr.cfm |publisher=''Center for Defence Information'' |date=5 June 2002 |accessdate=13 February 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070214103404/http://www.cdi.org/terrorism/farc-ira-pr.cfm |archivedate=14 February 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; according to security sources, he was head of the IRA's engineering section.&lt;ref name="mult3"/&gt;

Martin McCauley was born on 1 December 1962 in [[County Armagh]].&lt;ref name="mult5"/&gt; He was shot aged 19 in 1982 by the [[Royal Ulster Constabulary]] (RUC) in a barn near [[Lurgan]] resulting from which he won a five-figure sum for damages against the RUC. He was unarmed at the time and another teenager was killed. In 1985 he was charged with weapons possession in [[Northern Ireland]] and received a two-year [[suspended sentence]].&lt;ref name="mult3"/&gt; He was a Sinn Féin election worker during assembly elections in the [[Upper Bann (Assembly constituency)|Upper Bann]] constituency in 1998, but according to Sinn Féin he was not a member of the party.&lt;ref name="mult4"&gt;{{cite news | title = Who are IRA suspects? | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/1494880.stm | publisher = ''BBC News'' | date = 17 August 2001 | accessdate = 12 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; McCauley is regarded as a leading figure in the IRA's engineering section.&lt;ref name="mult1"/&gt;

[[Image:Tom Bell's graph showing extension of U.S. copyright term over time.svg|thumb|right|450px|Expansion of U.S. copyright law (assuming authors create their works 35 years before their death)]]

The '''Copyright Term Extension Act''' ('''CTEA''') of 1998 extended [[United States copyright law|copyright]] [[copyright term|terms]] in the [[United States]]. It is one of several acts extending the terms of copyrights.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.copyright.gov/circs/circ15a.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the [[Copyright Act of 1976]], [[copyright]] would last for the life of the author plus 50 years, or 75 years for a work of [[corporate authorship]]. The 1976 Act also increased the extension term for works copyrighted before 1978 that had not already entered the public domain from 28 years to 47 years, giving a total term of 75 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.copyright.gov/pr/pdomain.html|title=U.S. Copyright Office - Certain Unpublished, Unregistered Works Enter Public Domain|last=(www.copyright.gov)|first=U.S. Copyright Office|website=www.copyright.gov|access-date=2018-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1998 Act extended these terms to life of the author plus 70 years and for works of corporate authorship to 120 years after creation or 95 years after publication, whichever end is earlier.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Copyright Office,  Circular 1: [http://www.copyright.gov/circs/circ01.pdf Copyright Basics], pp. 5–6&lt;/ref&gt;  Copyright protection for works published before January 1, 1978, was increased by 20 years to a total of 95 years from their publication date.

This law, also known as the '''[[Sonny Bono]] Copyright Term Extension Act''', '''Sonny Bono Act''', or (derisively) the '''[[Mickey Mouse]] Protection Act''',{{r|lessig}} effectively "froze" the advancement date of the [[public domain in the United States]] for works covered by the older fixed term copyright rules. Under this Act, works made in 1923 or afterwards that were still protected by copyright in 1998 will not enter the public domain until 2019 or later.  Mickey Mouse specifically, having first appeared in 1928, will be in a public domain work in 2024&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://copyright.nova.edu/mickey-public-domain/|title=Mickey’s Headed to the Public Domain! But Will He Go Quietly? - Office of Copyright|date=2014-10-17|work=Office of Copyright|access-date=2018-01-14|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; or afterward (depending on the date of the product) unless the owner of the copyright releases them into the public domain before then. Unlike [[Copyright law of the European Union#Duration of protection|copyright extension legislation in the European Union]], the Sonny Bono Act did not revive copyrights that had already expired. The Act did extend the terms of protection set for works that were already copyrighted, and is retroactive in that sense. However, works created before January 1, 1978, but not published or registered for copyright until recently, are addressed in a special section ({{USC|17|303}}) and may remain protected until the end of 2047. The Act became {{USPL|105|298}} on October 27, 1998.

== Background ==
Under the international [[Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works]] of 1886, the signatory countries are required to provide copyright protection for a minimum term of the life of the author plus fifty years. Additionally, they are permitted to provide for a longer term of protection. The Berne Convention did not come into force for the [[United States]] until it was ratified on March 1, 1989, but the U.S. had previously provided for the minimum copyright term the convention required in the [[Copyright Act of 1976]].

After the United States' accession to the Berne convention, a number of copyright owners successfully [[lobbying|lobbied]] the [[Congress of the United States|U.S. Congress]] for another extension of the term of copyright, to provide for the same term of protection that exists in [[Europe]]. Since the 1993 [[Directive on harmonising the term of copyright protection]], member states of the [[European Union]] implemented protection for a term of the author's life plus seventy years.

The act was named in memory of the late Congressman [[Sonny Bono]], who died nine months before the act became law: he had previously been one of twelve sponsors of a similar bill.

House members sympathetic to restaurant and bar owners, who were upset over [[ASCAP]] and [[Broadcast Music Incorporated|BMI]] licensing practices, almost derailed the Act. As a result, the bill was amended to include the [[Fairness in Music Licensing Act of 1998|Fairness in Music Licensing Act]], which exempted smaller establishments from needing a public performance license to play music.&lt;ref&gt;[[William Patry]], 1 ''Patry on Copyright'' § 1:97 (Thomson Reuters/West 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Senate Report&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/cpquery/R?cp104:FLD010:@1(sr315) |title=Senate Report 104-315 |publisher=Thomas.loc.gov |date= |accessdate=2011-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; gave the official reasons for passing copyright extension laws and was originally written in the context of the Copyright Term Extension Act of 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.congress.gov/bill/104th-congress/senate-bill/483 |title=S.483 - Copyright Term Extension Act of 1996 |publisher=Congress.gov |date=1996-07-10 |accessdate=2014-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|The purpose of the bill is to ensure adequate copyright protection for American works in foreign nations and the continued economic benefits of a healthy surplus [[balance of trade]] in the exploitation of copyrighted works. The bill accomplishes these goals by extending the current U.S. copyright term for an additional 21 years. Such an extension will provide significant trade benefits by substantially harmonizing U.S. copyright law to that of the European Union while ensuring fair compensation for American creators who deserve to benefit fully from the exploitation of their works. Moreover, by stimulating the creation of new works and providing enhanced economic incentives to preserve existing works, such an extension will enhance the long-term volume, vitality and accessibility of the public domain.}}

The authors of the report believed that extending copyright protection would help the United States by providing more protection for their works in foreign countries and by giving more incentive to digitize and preserve works since there was an exclusive right in them. The report also included minority opinions by [[Herbert Kohl (senator)|Herb Kohl]] and [[Hank Brown]], who believed that the term extensions were a financial windfall to current owners of copyrighted material at the expense of the public's use of the material.

=== Support ===
Since 1990, [[The Walt Disney Company]] had lobbied for copyright extension.{{r|dlobby1|dlobby2}} The legislation delayed the entry into the public domain of the earliest [[Mickey Mouse]] movies, leading detractors to the nickname "The Mickey Mouse Protection Act".{{r|lessig}}

In addition to Disney, California congresswoman [[Mary Bono Mack|Mary Bono]] (Sonny Bono's widow and Congressional successor), and the estate of composer [[George Gershwin]] supported the act. Mary Bono, speaking on the floor of the [[United States House of Representatives]], said:

{{quote|Actually, Sonny wanted the term of copyright protection to last forever. I am informed by staff that such a change would violate the [[Copyright Clause|Constitution]]. ... As you know, there is also &lt;nowiki&gt;[then-&lt;/nowiki&gt;[[Motion Picture Association of America|MPAA]] president&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; [[Jack Valenti]]'s proposal for &lt;!-- "the" is not in the quote here --&gt; term to last forever less one day. Perhaps the Committee may look at that next Congress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getpage.cgi?dbname=1998_record&amp;position=all&amp;page=H9952|date=October 7, 1998|publisher=[[United States Government Printing Office|Government Printing Office]]|accessdate=2007-10-30|work=[[Congressional Record]]|title=H9952}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
 
Other parties that lobbied in favor of the Bono Act were [[Time Warner]], [[Universal Pictures|Universal]], [[Viacom]], the major professional sports leagues ([[NFL]], [[NBA]], [[NHL]], [[MLB]]), and the family of slain singer [[Selena Quintanilla-Pérez]].{{r|dlobby1|dlobby2}}

Proponents of the Bono Act argue that it is necessary given that the [[life expectancy]] of humans has risen dramatically since Congress passed the original [[Copyright Act of 1790]],&lt;ref name=Orr&gt;{{cite web | title= Senator Orrin Hatch’s Introduction of The Copyright Term Extension Act of 1997 | url=http://www.copyrightextension.com/page04.html | date= 1997-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; that a difference in copyright terms between the United States and Europe would negatively affect the international operations of the [[entertainment industry]],&lt;ref name="Orr"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Fein&gt;{{cite web | title=Senator Dianne Feinstein's Statement before Congress | url=http://www.copyrightextension.com/page06.html | date=1997-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that some works would be created under a longer copyright that would never be created under the existing copyright. They also claim that copyrighted works are an important source of income to the US&lt;ref name="Fein"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Leh&gt;{{cite web | title= Excerpts of Bruce A. Lehman’s statement before Congress |  url= http://www.copyrightextension.com/page07.html | date= 1995-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that media such as [[VHS]], [[DVD]], [[Cable television|Cable]] and [[Satellite]] have increased the value and commercial life of movies and television series.&lt;ref name="Fein"/&gt;

Proponents contend that Congress has the power to pass whatever copyright term it wants because the language "To promote the progress of science and useful arts" in the United States Constitution is not a substantive limitation on the powers of Congress, leaving the sole restriction that copyrights must only last for "limited times." However, in what respect the granted time must be limited has never been determined, thus arguably even an absurdly long, yet finite, duration would still be a valid ''limited time'' according to the letter of the Constitution as long as Congress was ostensibly setting this limit to promote the progress of science and useful arts. This was one of the arguments that prevailed in the ''[[Eldred v. Ashcroft]]'' case, when the Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the CTEA. It is also pointed out by proponents that the extension did not prevent all works from going in the public domain. They note that the 1976 Copyright Act established that [[unpublished]] works created before 1978 would still begin entering the public domain January 1, 2003 (Known author: life of the author plus 70 years; anonymous/pseudoanonymous/unknown author/works-for-hire: 120 years from creation), and that the provision remained unaffected by the 1998 extension.&lt;ref name="Scott"/&gt; They also claim that Congress has actually increased the scope of the public domain since, for the first time, unpublished works will enter the public domain.&lt;ref name="Scott"/&gt;

Proponents believe that copyright encourages progress in the arts. With an extension of copyright, future artists have to create something original, rather than reuse old work, however, had the act been in place in the 1960s, it is unlikely that [[Andy Warhol]] would have been able to sell or even exhibit any of his work, since it all incorporated previously copyrighted material. Proponents contend that it is more important to encourage all creators to make new works instead of just copyright holders.&lt;ref name=Scott&gt;{{cite journal| author = Scott M. Martin | date = September 24, 2002 | title = The Mythology of the Public Domain: Exploring the Myths Behind Attacks on the Duration of Copyright Protection | journal = Loyola of Los Angeles Law Review | volume = 36| issue = 1| page = 280| publisher = Loyola Law Review| issn = 1533-5860 | url = http://digitalcommons.lmu.edu/llr/vol36/iss1/7/ | accessdate = 2007-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Proponents say that copyright better preserves intellectual property like movies, music and television shows.&lt;ref name="Leh"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Scott"/&gt; One example given is the case of the classic film ''[[It's a Wonderful Life]]''.&lt;ref name="Leh"/&gt; Before [[Republic Pictures]] and [[Spelling Entertainment]] (who owned the motion picture rights to the short story and the music even after the film itself became public domain) began to assert their rights to the film, various local TV stations and cable networks broadcast the film endlessly. As ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' reporter Bill Carter put it: "the film's currency was being devalued."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = THE MEDIA BUSINESS; Television | work = New York Times | date = 1994-12-19 | first = Bill | last = Carter | pages = D10| id = | url =https://www.nytimes.com/1994/12/19/business/the-media-business-television.html?scp=3&amp;sq=tyrone+power&amp;st=nyt | accessdate = 2010-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many different versions of the film were made and most if not all were in horrible condition.&lt;ref&gt;''See Two Days of Christmas Classics'', TORONTO STAR, December 24, 1999, At E1.&lt;/ref&gt; After underlying rights to the film were enforced, it was given a high quality restoration that was hailed by critics. In addition, proponents note that once a work falls into the public domain there is no guarantee that the work will be more widely available or cheaper. Suggesting that quality copies of public domain works are not widely available, they argue that one reason for a lack of availability may be due to publishers' reluctance to publish a work that is in the public domain for fear that they will not be able to recoup their investment or earn enough profit.&lt;ref name="Leh"/&gt;

Proponents reject the idea that only works in the public domain can provide artistic inspiration. They note that opponents fail to take into account that copyright applies only to expressions of ideas and not the ideas themselves.&lt;ref name="Scott"/&gt; Thus artists are free to get ideas from copyrighted works as long as they do not [[copyright infringement|infringe]]. Borrowing ideas and such are common in film, TV and music even with copyrighted works (see ''[[scènes à faire]]'', [[idea-expression divide]] and [[stock character]]). Works such as [[parody]] benefit from [[fair use]].

Proponents also question the idea that extended copyright is "corporate welfare." They state that many opponents also have a stake in the case, claiming that those arguing against copyright term extension are mostly businesses that depend on distributing films and videos that have lost their copyright.&lt;ref name="Leh"/&gt;

One argument against the CTEA is focused on the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]]. In ''[[Harper &amp; Row v. Nation Enterprises]]'', however, the court explained how a copyright "respects and adequately safeguards the [[freedom of speech]] protected by the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]]."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://repository.jmls.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1025&amp;context=ripl|title=Mickey Mouse &amp; Sonny Bonno Go to Court: The Copyright Term Extension Act and its Effect on Current and Future Rights|last=Grzelak|first=Victoria A.|date=2002|website=|access-date=May 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In following this approach, courts have held that copyrights are "categorically immune from challenges under the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]]."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Opposition ===
Critics of the CTEA argue that it was never the original intention for copyright protection to be extended in the United States. Attorney [https://www.robbinsarroyo.com/jenny-l-dixon/ Jenny L. Dixon] mentions that "the United States has always viewed copyright primarily as a vehicle for achieving social benefit based on the belief that encouragement of individual effort by personal gain is the best way to advance the public welfare;"&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?handle=hein.journals/hascom18&amp;div=44&amp;g_sent=1&amp;collection=journals|title=The Copyright Term Extension Act: Is Life Plus Seventy Too Much|last=Dixon|first=Jenny L.|date=|website=|access-date=May 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, "the U.S. does not consider copyright as a 'natural right.'"&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Dixon continues that with increased extensions on copyright protections, authors receive the benefits, while the public have more difficulty accessing these works, weakening public domain.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; One such extension Dixon mentions is the protection of a copyrighted work for the author's life followed by two generations, which opponents argue that there is no legislation nor intention for this copyright protection.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; "These constitutionally-grounded arguments 'for limitations on proprietary rights' are being rejected time and time again."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

[[Dennis S. Karjala]], a law professor, led an effort to try to prevent the CTEA from being passed.  He testified before the Committees on the Judiciary arguing "that extending the term of copyright protection would impose substantial costs on the United States general public without supplying any public benefit. The extension bills represent a fundamental departure from the United States philosophy that intellectual property legislation serve a public purpose."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Karjala|first1=Dennis|title=Opposing Copyright Extension, Legislative Materials (105th Congress), Statement of Copyright and Intellectual Property Law Professors in Opposition to H.R. 604, H.R. 2589, and S.505|url=http://homepages.law.asu.edu/~dkarjala/OpposingCopyrightExtension/legmats/1998statement.html|accessdate=22 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An editorial in ''[[The New York Times]]'' argued against the copyright extension on February 21, 1998.  The article stated "When Senator Hatch laments that [[George Gershwin]]'s ''[[Rhapsody in Blue]]'' will soon 'fall into the public domain,' he makes the public domain sound like a dark abyss where songs go, never to be heard again. In fact, when a work enters the public domain it means the public can afford to use it freely, to give it new currency."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=The New York Times |date=February 21, 1998 |title=Keeping Copyright in Balance |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/02/21/opinion/keeping-copyright-in-balance.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Opponents of the ''Bono Act'' consider the legislation to be [[corporate welfare]] and have [[Eldred v. Ashcroft|tried (but failed)]] to have it declared [[unconstitutional]], claiming that such an act is not "necessary and proper" to accomplishing the Constitution's stated purpose of "promot[ing] the progress of science and useful arts".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/openlaw/eldredvashcroft/supct/amici/ip-lawprofs.pdf |title=BRIEF OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY LAW PROFESSORS AS AMICI CURIAE SUPPORTING PETITIONERS|format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2011-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; They argue that most works bring most of the profits during the first few years and are pushed off the market by the publishers thereafter. Thus there is little economic incentive in extending the terms of copyrights except for the few owners of franchises that are wildly successful, such as Disney. They also point out that the [[Tenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Tenth Amendment]] can be construed as placing limits on the powers that Congress can gain from a treaty. More directly, they see two successive terms of approximately 20 years each (the [[Copyright Act of 1976]] and the Bono Act) as the beginning of a "slippery slope" toward a [[perpetual copyright]] term that nullifies the intended effect and violates the spirit of the "for limited times" language of the [[United States Constitution/Article One|United States Constitution, Article I]], section 8, clause 8.&lt;ref name="United States Constitution"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/constitution.articlei.html |title=Cornell University Law School – United States Constitution |publisher=Law.cornell.edu |date= |accessdate=2011-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some opponents have questioned the proponents' life expectancy argument, making the comparison between the growth of copyright terms and the term of patents in relation to the growth of life expectancies. Life expectancies have risen from about 35 years in 1800 &lt;ref name="Life Expectancies in 1800s"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.answers.com/topic/life-expectancy |title=Life Expectancies in 1800s |publisher=Answers.com |date= |accessdate=2011-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; to 77.6 years in 2002.&lt;ref name="Life Expectancies in 2000s"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/20557.php |title=Life Expectancies in 20002 |publisher=Medical News Today |date= |accessdate=2011-01-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101219101307/http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/20557.php |archivedate=2010-12-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; While copyright terms have increased threefold, from only 28 years total (under the [[Copyright Act of 1790]]), life expectancies have roughly doubled. Moreover, life expectancy statistics are skewed due to historically high infant mortality rates. Correcting for infant mortality, life expectancy has only increased by fifteen years between 1850 and 2000.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.infoplease.com/ipa/A0005140.html&lt;/ref&gt;
In addition, copyright terms have increased significantly since the 1790 act, but [[patent]] terms have not been extended in parallel, with 20-year terms of protection remaining the (presumably under the laws) adequate compensation for innovation in a technical field.&lt;ref name="Patent Laws"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/pac/doc/general/index.html#laws |title=United States Patent and Trademark Office – General Information |publisher=Uspto.gov |date= |accessdate=2011-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Seventeen prominent economists, including [[Kenneth Arrow]], [[Ronald Coase]], and [[Milton Friedman]], submitted an [[amicus curiae|amicus brief]] opposing the bill when it was challenged in court. They argued that the [[discounting|discounted]] [[present value]] of the extension was only a 1% increase for newly created works, while the increase in [[transaction cost]]s created by extending the terms of old works would be very large and without any [[Marginalism|marginal]] benefit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BRIEF OF GEORGE A.

A reasonable man, he signed even though we couldn’t fit that word in."}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another argument against the CTEA is focused on the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] "because of the prospective and retrospective application of the CTEA."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The plaintiffs in ''[[Eldred v. Reno]]'' believed that "the CTEA failed to sustain the intermediate level of scrutiny test afforded by the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] because the government did not have an 'important' interest to justify withholding speech."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Opponents also argue that the Act encourages "offshore production." For example, derivative works could be created outside the United States in areas where copyright would have expired, and that US law would prohibit these works to US residents. For example, a movie of Mickey Mouse playing with a computer could be legally created in Russia, but the movie would be refused admission for importation by US Customs because of copyright, resulting in a deprivation to American children. Similarly, the first [[Winnie-the-Pooh]] book was published in 1926 and would have been public domain in 2001.&lt;ref name="Winnie the Pooh"&gt;{{cite web|last=Macavinta |first=Courtney |url=http://news.cnet.com/Copyright-extension-law-at-issue-in-suit/2100-1023_3-220049.html |title=CNET – Copyright extension law |publisher=News.cnet.com |date= |accessdate=2011-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lavasurfer.com/pooh-faq10.html |title=Winnie the Pooh – FAQ – Your Frequently Asked Questions X |publisher=Lavasurfer.com |date= |accessdate=2011-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Opponents identify another possible harm from copyright extension: loss of productive value of private collections of copyrighted works. A person who collected copyrighted works that would soon "go out of copyright," intending to re-release them on copyright expiration, lost the use of his capital expenditures for an additional 20 years when the Bono Act passed. This is part of the underlying argument in ''[[Eldred v. Ashcroft]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://archive.salon.com/tech/feature/2002/02/21/web_copyright/index.html |title=Salon.com Technology &amp;#124; Mickey Mouse vs. The People |publisher=Archive.salon.com |date=2002-02-21 |accessdate=2011-01-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090422054443/http://archive.salon.com/tech/feature/2002/02/21/web_copyright/index.html |archivedate=2009-04-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Bono Act is thus perceived to add an instability to commerce and investment, areas which have a better legal theoretical basis than intellectual property, whose theory is of quite recent development and is often criticized as being a corporate chimera. Conceivably, if one had made such an investment and then produced a derivative work (or perhaps even re-released the work ''in ipse''), he could counter a suit made by the copyright holder by declaring that Congress had unconstitutionally made, [[ex post facto]], a restriction on the previously unrestricted.

[[Howard Besser]] questioned the proponents' argument that "new works would not be created", which implies that the goal of copyright is to make the creation of new works possible. However, the Framers of the United States Constitution evidently thought that unnecessary, instead restricting the goal of copyright to merely "promot[ing] the progress of science and useful arts". In fact, some works created under time-limited copyright would not be created under perpetual copyright because the creator of a distantly derivative work does not have the money and resources to find the owner of copyright in the original work and purchase a license, or the individual or privately held owner of copyright in the original work might refuse to license a use at any price (though a refusal to license may trigger a fair use safety valve). Thus they argue that a rich, continually replenished, public domain is necessary for continued artistic creation.&lt;ref name="Besser 1998"&gt;[[Howard Besser]], [http://www.studiolo.org/IP/TTM/BESSER.htm ''The Erosion of Public Protection: Attacks on the concept of Fair Use''], Paper delivered at the Town Meeting on Copyright &amp; Fair Use, College Art Association, Toronto, February 1998.

=== March 25, 1998 House Debate ===

The House debated the Copyright Term Extension Act (House Resolution 390) on March 25, 1998.&lt;ref&gt;Congressional Record, Volume 144, 1998, H1456-H1483, March 25, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;  The term extension was almost completely supported, with only the mild criticism by [[Jim Sensenbrenner]] (Wisconsin) of "H.R. 2589 provides a very generous windfall to the entertainment industry by extending the term of copyright for an additional 20 years."&lt;ref&gt;Congressional Record, Volume 144, 1998, H1459&lt;/ref&gt;  He suggested that it could be balanced by adding provisions from the [[Fairness in Music Licensing Act]] (H.R. 789).  [[Lloyd Doggett]] (Texas) called the 'Fairness in Music Licensing Act' the 'Music Theft Act' and claimed that it was a mechanism to "steal the intellectual property of thousands of small businesspeople who are song writers in this land."&lt;ref&gt;Congressional Record, Volume 144, 1998, H1457&lt;/ref&gt;  The majority of subsequent debate was over Sensenbrenner's House Amendment 532&lt;ref&gt;http://hdl.loc.gov/loc.uscongress/legislation.105hamdt532 {{cite web|url=http://hdl.loc.gov/loc.uscongress/legislation.105hamdt532 |title=Handle Problem Report (Library of Congress) |publisher=Hdl.loc.gov |date= |accessdate=2011-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;  to the CTEA. This amendment was over details of allowing music from radio and television broadcasts in small businesses to be played without licensing fees.  An amendment to Sensenbrenner's amendment was proposed by [[Bill McCollum]],.&lt;ref&gt;http://hdl.loc.gov/loc.uscongress/legislation.105hamdt533 {{cite web|url=http://hdl.loc.gov/loc.uscongress/legislation.105hamdt533 |title=Handle Problem Report (Library of Congress) |publisher=Hdl.loc.gov |date= |accessdate=2011-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The key differences between Sensenbrenner's proposal and McCollum's amendment were 1) local arbitration versus court lawsuits in rate disagreements, 2) all retail businesses versus only restaurants and bars, 3) 3500 square feet of general public area versus {{convert|3500|sqft|m2}} of gross area, 4) which music licensing societies it applied to (all versus ASCAP and BMI), and 5) freedom from vicarious liability for landlords and others leasing space versus no such provision.&lt;ref&gt;Congressional Record, Volume 144, 1998, H1470-H1471&lt;/ref&gt;  After debate (and the first verse of American Pie&lt;ref&gt;Congressional Record, Volume 144, 1998, H1471&lt;/ref&gt;) the McCollum Amendment was rejected in by 259 to 150&lt;ref&gt;Congressional Record, Volume 144, 1998, H1482&lt;/ref&gt; and the Sensenbrenner amendment was passed by 297 to 112.&lt;ref&gt;Congressional Record, Volume 144, 1998, H1482-H1483&lt;/ref&gt;  The Copyright Term Extension Act H.R. 2589 was passed.&lt;ref&gt;Congressional Record, Volume 144, 1998, H1483&lt;/ref&gt;

The term extension was supported for two key reasons.  First, "copyright industries give us [(the United States)] one of our most significant trade surpluses."  Second, the recently enacted legislation in the European Union had extended copyright there for 20 years, and so EU works would be protected for 20 years longer than US works if the US did not enact similar term extensions.  [[Howard Coble]] also stated that it was good for consumers since "When works are protected by copyright, they attract investors who can exploit the work for profit."&lt;ref&gt;Congressional Record, Volume 144, 1998, Coble, North Carolina, H1458&lt;/ref&gt;  The term extension portion was supported by [[Songwriters Guild of America]], [[National Academy of Songwriters]], the [[Motion Picture Association of America]], the Intellectual Property Law Section of the American Bar Association, the [[Recording Industry Association of America]], [[National Music Publishers Association]], the [[Information Technology Association of America]] and others.&lt;ref&gt;Congressional Record, Volume 144, 1998, H1463&lt;/ref&gt;

== Challenges ==

===Legal===
Publishers and librarians, among others, brought a lawsuit, ''[[Eldred v. Ashcroft]]'', to obtain an injunction on enforcement of the act. Oral arguments were heard by the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] on October 9, 2002. On January 15, 2003 the court held the CTEA constitutional by a 7–2 decision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-switch/wp/2013/10/25/15-years-ago-congress-kept-mickey-mouse-out-of-the-public-domain-will-they-do-it-again/ |author= Timothy B. Lee|work=Washington Post |date=October 25, 2013 |title=15 years ago, Congress kept Mickey Mouse out of the public domain. Will they do it again?}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, the plaintiffs in the ''Eldred'' case began to shift their effort toward the U.S. Congress in support of a bill called the [[Public Domain Enhancement Act]] that would make the provisions of the Bono Act apply only to copyrights that had been registered with the [[Library of Congress]].

===Empirical testing===
In 2012, law professors Christopher Buccafusco and Paul J. Heald performed tests of three key justifications of copyright extension, namely: that public domain works will be underutilized and less available, will be oversaturated by poor quality copies, and poor quality derivative works will harm the reputation of the original works. They compared works from the two decades surrounding 1923 made available as audiobooks. They found that copyrighted works were available at a significantly lower rate than public domain ones, found no evidence of overexploitation driving down the price of works, and that the quality of the audiobook recordings did not significantly affect the price people were willing to pay for the books in print.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Buccafusco |first1=Christopher |last2=Heald |first2=Paul J. |date=2012-08-15 |title=Do Bad Things Happen When Works Enter the Public Domain?: Empirical Tests of Copyright Term Extension |journal=Berkeley Technology Law Journal |volume= |issue= |pages= |doi= |ssrn=2130008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Heald's later experiment analyzing a random sample of newly-posted works on [[Amazon.com]] revealed that public domain works from 1880 were posted at double the rate of copyrighted works from 1980.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Heald |first1=Paul J. |date=2013-07-05 |title=How Copyright Keeps Works Disappeared |journal=

{{Companies law}}

[[File:New McDonald's restaurant in Mount Pleasant, Iowa.jpg|thumb|upright=0.95|[[McDonald's|McDonald's Corporation]] is one of the most recognizable corporations in the world.]]

A '''corporation''' is a [[company]], a group of people or an organization authorized to act as a single entity ([[legal person|legally a person]]) and recognized as such in law. Early incorporated entities were established by [[charter]] (i.e. by an ''ad hoc'' act granted by a monarch or passed by a parliament or legislature). Most jurisdictions now allow the creation of new corporations through [[List of company registers|registration]].  Corporations enjoy limited liability for their investors, which can lead to losses being externalized from investors to the government or general public.&lt;ref name="Known"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Limited Liability and the Known Unknown|journal=Social Science Research Network|date=2018|url=https://ssrn.com/abstract=3121519}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Corporations come in many different types but are usually divided by the law of the jurisdiction where they are chartered into two kinds: by whether they can issue [[stock]] or not, or by whether they are formed to make a [[profit (accounting)|profit]] or not.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.corpnet.com/types-of-corporations/#gfp|title=Types Of Corporations {{!}} Incorporate A Business|website=www.corpnet.com|language=en|access-date=2017-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Corporations can be divided by the number of owners: corporation aggregate or [[corporation sole | corporation sole]]. The subject of this article is a corporation aggregate. A corporation sole is a legal entity consisting of a single ("sole") incorporated office, occupied by a single ("sole") [[natural person | natural person]].

Where local law distinguishes corporations by the ability to issue stock, corporations allowed to do so are referred to as "stock corporations", ownership of the corporation is through stock, and owners of stock are referred to as "stockholders" or "shareholders". Corporations not allowed to issue stock are referred to as "non-stock" corporations; those who are considered the owners of a non-stock corporation are persons (or other entities) who have obtained membership in the corporation and are referred to as a "member" of the corporation.

Corporations chartered in regions where they are distinguished by whether they are allowed to be for profit or not are referred to as "for profit" and "not-for-profit" corporations, respectively.

There is some overlap between stock/non-stock and for-profit/not-for-profit in that not-for-profit corporations are always non-stock as well. A for-profit corporation is almost always a stock corporation, but some for-profit corporations may choose to be non-stock&lt;!-- non-stock --&gt;. To simplify the explanation, whenever "[[Shareholder|Stockholder]]" or "[[shareholder]]" is used in the rest of this article to refer to a stock corporation, it is presumed to mean the same as "member" for a non-profit corporation or for a profit, non-stock corporation.

Registered corporations have [[legal personality]] and their shares are owned by shareholders&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Company Law |last1=Pettet |first1=B. G. |publisher=Pearson Education |year=2005 |page=151 |quote=Reading the above, makes it possible to forget that the shareholders are the ''owners'' of the company.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Law of Private Companies |first1=Thomas B. |last1=Courtney |publisher=Bloomsbury Professional |year=2002 |edition=2nd |at=4.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; whose liability is generally [[limited liability|limited]] to their investment.  Shareholders do not typically actively manage a corporation; shareholders instead elect or appoint a [[board of directors]] to control the corporation in a [[fiduciary]] capacity.  In most circumstances, a shareholder may also serve as a director or officer of a corporation.

In [[American English]], the word ''corporation'' is most often used to describe large [[Corporate law|business corporations]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/american/corporation corporation]. CollinsDictionary.com. Collins English Dictionary – Complete &amp; Unabridged 11th Edition. Retrieved December 07, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[British English]] and in the [[Commonwealth countries]], the term ''company'' is more widely used to describe the same sort of entity while the word ''corporation'' encompasses all incorporated entities. In American English, the word ''company'' can include entities such as [[partnership]]s that would not be referred to as companies in British English as they are not a [[separate legal entity]].

Late in the 19th century, a new form of company having the limited liability protections of a corporation, and the more favorable tax treatment of either a sole proprietorship or partnership was developed. While not a corporation, this new type of entity became very attractive as an alternative for corporations not needing to issue stock. In Germany, the organization was referred to as ''[[Gesellschaft mit beschränkter Haftung]]'' or ''GmbH''. In the last quarter of the 20th Century this new form of non-corporate organization became available in the United States and other countries, and was known as the ''[[limited liability company]]'' or ''LLC''. Since the GmbH and LLC forms of organization are technically not corporations (even though they have many of the same features), they will not be discussed in this article.

==History==
{{see also|List of oldest companies}}
[[File: Stora Kopparberg 1288.jpg|thumb|1/8 share of the [[Falun Mine|Stora Kopparberg]] mine, dated June 16, 1288.]]
The word "corporation" derives from ''corpus'', the [[Latin]] word for body, or a "body of people". By the time of [[Justinian I|Justinian]] (reigned 527–565), [[Roman law]] recognized a range of corporate entities under the names ''universitas'', ''corpus'' or ''collegium''. These included the state itself (the ''Populus Romanus''), municipalities, and such private associations as sponsors of a [[Cult (religious practice)|religious cult]], [[Burial society|burial clubs]], political groups, and guilds of craftsmen or traders. Such bodies commonly had the right to own property and make contracts, to receive gifts and legacies, to sue and be sued, and, in general, to perform legal acts through representatives. Private associations were granted designated privileges and liberties by the emperor.&lt;ref&gt;Harold Joseph Berman, ''Law and Revolution'' (vol. 1)'': The Formation of the Western Legal Tradition'', Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1983, pp. 215–16. {{ISBN|0674517768}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Entities which carried on business and were the subjects of legal rights were found in [[ancient Rome]], and the [[Maurya Empire]] in ancient India.&lt;ref&gt;Vikramaditya S. Khanna (2005). [http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id= ''The Economic History of the Corporate Form in Ancient India.''] [[University of Michigan]].&lt;/ref&gt; In medieval Europe, churches became incorporated, as did local governments, such as the [[Pope]] and the [[City of London Corporation]]. The point was that the incorporation would survive longer than the lives of any particular member, existing in perpetuity. The alleged oldest commercial corporation in the world, the [[Falun Mine|Stora Kopparberg]] mining community in [[Falun]], [[Sweden]], obtained a [[charter]] from King [[Magnus IV of Sweden|Magnus Eriksson]] in 1347.

In medieval times, traders would do business through [[common law]] constructs, such as [[partnership]]s. Whenever people acted together with a view to profit, the law deemed that a partnership arose. Early [[guild]]s and [[Livery company|livery companies]] were also often involved in the [[restraint of trade|regulation of competition]] between traders.

[[File:Vereinigte Ostindische Compagnie bond.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|A [[bond (finance)|bond]] issued by the Dutch East India Company (VOC), dating from 1623, for the amount of 2,400 florins]]

The progenitors of the modern corporation were the chartered companies, such as the [[Dutch East India Company]] (VOC) and the [[Hudson's Bay Company]], which were created to lead the colonial ventures of European nations in the 17th century. Acting under a charter sanctioned by the Dutch government, the Dutch East India Company defeated [[Portugal|Portuguese]] forces and established itself in the [[Maluku Islands|Moluccan Islands]] in order to profit from the [[Europe]]an demand for [[spice]]s. Investors in the VOC were issued paper certificates as proof of share ownership, and were able to trade their shares on the original [[Amsterdam Stock Exchange]]. Shareholders were also explicitly granted [[limited liability]] in the company's royal charter.&lt;ref&gt;Om Prakash, ''European Commercial Enterprise in Pre-Colonial India'' (Cambridge University Press, Cambridge 1998).&lt;/ref&gt;

In England, the government created corporations under a [[royal charter]] or an [[Act of Parliament]] with the grant of a [[monopoly]] over a specified territory. The best-known example, established in 1600, was the [[East India Company]] of [[London]]. [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth I]] granted it the exclusive right to trade with all countries to the east of the [[Cape of Good Hope]]. Some corporations at this time would act on the government's behalf, bringing in revenue from its exploits abroad. Subsequently, the Company became [[Company rule in India|increasingly integrated]] with English and later British military and colonial policy, just as most corporations were essentially dependent on the [[Royal Navy]]'s ability to control trade routes.

Labeled by both contemporaries and historians as "the grandest society of merchants in the universe", the English East India Company would come to symbolize the dazzlingly rich potential of the corporation, as well as new methods of business that could be both brutal and exploitative.&lt;ref&gt;John Keay, ''The Honorable Company: A History of the English East India Company'' (MacMillan, New York 1991).&lt;/ref&gt; On 31 December 1600, Queen Elizabeth I granted the company a 15-year monopoly on trade to and from the [[East Indies]] and [[Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.utk.edu/~gerard/romanticpolitics/britisheastindia.html|title=British East India Company|first=Gerard Cohen-Vrignaud, Stephanie Metz, Jody Dunville, Shannon Heath, Julia P. McLeod, Kat Powell, Brent Robida, John Stromski, Brandon|last=Haynes|publisher=|accessdate=19 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1711, shareholders in the East India Company were earning a [[return on investment|return on their investment]] of almost 150 per cent. Subsequent stock offerings demonstrated just how lucrative the Company had become. Its first stock offering in 1713–1716 raised £418,000, its second in 1717–1722 raised £1.6 million.&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid.'' at p. 113&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:South-sea-bubble-chart.png|thumb|left|Chart of the [[South Sea Company]]'s stock prices. The rapid inflation of the stock value in the 1710s led to the [[Bubble Act|Bubble Act 1720]], which restricted the establishment of companies without a [[royal charter]].]]
A similar [[chartered company]], the [[South Sea Company]], was established in 1711 to trade in the Spanish South American colonies, but met with less success. The South Sea Company's monopoly rights were supposedly backed by the [[Treaty of Utrecht]], signed in 1713 as a settlement following the [[War of the Spanish Succession]], which gave [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]] an ''[[asiento]]'' to trade in the region for thirty years. In fact the Spanish remained hostile and let only one ship a year enter. Unaware of the problems, investors in Britain, enticed by extravagant promises of profit from [[Corporate promoter|company promoters]] bought thousands of shares. By 1717, the South Sea Company was so wealthy (still having done no real business) that it assumed the [[Government debt|public debt]] of the British government. This accelerated the inflation of the share price further, as did the [[Bubble Act|Bubble Act 1720]], which (possibly with the motive of protecting the South Sea Company from competition) prohibited the establishment of any companies without a Royal Charter. The share price rose so rapidly that people began buying shares merely in order to sell them at a higher price, which in turn led to higher share prices. This was the first [[Economic bubble|speculative bubble]] the country had seen, but by the end of 1720, the bubble had "burst", and the share price sank from £1000 to under £100. As bankruptcies and recriminations ricocheted through government and high society, the mood against corporations and errant directors was bitter.

In the late 18th century, [[Stewart Kyd]], the author of the first treatise on [[corporate law]] in English, defined a corporation as:

{{quote|a collection of many individuals united into one body, under a special denomination, having [[perpetual succession]] under an artificial form, and vested, by policy of the law, with the capacity of acting, in several respects, as an individual, particularly of taking and granting property, of contracting obligations, and of suing and being sued, of enjoying privileges and immunities in common, and of exercising a variety of political rights, more or less extensive, according to the design of its institution, or the powers conferred upon it, either at the time of its creation, or at any subsequent period of its existence.|A Treatise on the Law of Corporations, Stewart Kyd (1793–1794)}}

===Modern company law===
Due to the late 18th century abandonment of [[Mercantilism|mercantilist]] economic theory and the rise of [[classical liberalism]] and [[laissez-faire]] economic theory due to a revolution in [[economics]] led by [[Adam Smith]] and other economists, corporations transitioned from being government or [[guild]] affiliated entities to being public and private economic entities free of governmental directions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://political-economy.com/adam-smith-laissez-faire/|title=Adam Smith Laissez-Faire|website=political-economy.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Adam Smith wrote in his 1776 work ''[[The Wealth of Nations]]'' that mass corporate activity could not match private entrepreneurship, because people in charge of others' money would not exercise as much care as they would with their own.&lt;ref&gt;A Smith, ''[[An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations]]'' (1776), Book V, ch 1, para 107.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Deregulation====
[[File: Jack and the Giant Joint-Stock.jpg|thumb|"Jack and the Giant Joint-Stock", a cartoon in ''Town Talk'' (1858) satirizing the 'monster' joint-stock economy that came into being after the [[Joint Stock Companies Act 1844]].]]
The British Bubble Act 1720's prohibition on establishing companies remained in force until its repeal in 1825. By this point, the [[Industrial Revolution]] had gathered pace, pressing for legal change to facilitate business activity.&lt;ref&gt;See [[Bubble Companies, etc. Act 1825]], 6 Geo 4, c 91&lt;/ref&gt; The repeal was the beginning of a gradual lifting on restrictions, though business ventures (such as those chronicled by [[Charles Dickens]] in ''[[Martin Chuzzlewit]]'') under primitive companies legislation were often scams. Without cohesive regulation, proverbial operations like the "Anglo-Bengalee Disinterested Loan and Life Assurance Company" were undercapitalised ventures promising no hope of success except for richly paid promoters.&lt;ref&gt;See [[C Dickens]], ''[[Martin Chuzzlewit]]'' (1843) [[s:Martin Chuzzlewit/Chapter 27|ch 27]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The process of [[incorporation (business)|incorporation]] was possible only through a [[royal charter]] or a [[local and personal Acts of Parliament in the United Kingdom|private act]] and was limited, owing to Parliament's jealous protection of the privileges and advantages thereby granted. As a result, many businesses came to be operated as [[Voluntary association|unincorporated associations]] with possibly thousands of members. Any consequent [[Lawsuit|litigation]] had to be carried out in the joint names of all the members and was almost impossibly cumbersome. Though Parliament would sometimes grant a private act to allow an individual to represent the whole in legal proceedings, this was a narrow and necessarily costly expedient, allowed only to established companies.

Then, in 1843, [[William Ewart Gladstone|William Gladstone]] became the chairman of a Parliamentary Committee on Joint Stock Companies, which led to the [[Joint Stock Companies Act 1844]], regarded as the first modern piece of company law.&lt;ref&gt;''Report of the Parliamentary Committee on Joint Stock Companies'' (1844) in ''British Parliamentary Papers'', vol. VII&lt;/ref&gt; The Act created the [[Registrar of Companies|Registrar of Joint Stock Companies]], empowered to register companies by a two-stage process. The first, provisional, stage cost £5 and did not confer corporate status, which arose after completing the second stage for another £5. For the first time in history, it was possible for ordinary people through a simple registration procedure to incorporate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LQflMqcZyOoC|title=Introduction to Company Law|author=Paul Lyndon Davies|year=2010|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The advantage of establishing a company as a [[Legal personality|separate legal person]] was mainly administrative, as a unified entity under which the rights and duties of all investors and managers could be channeled.

====Limited liability====
However, there was still no limited liability and company members could still be held responsible for unlimited losses by the company.&lt;ref&gt;''Re Sea Fire and Life Assurance Co., Greenwood's Case'' (1854) 3 De GM&amp;G 459&lt;/ref&gt; The next, crucial development, then, was the [[Limited Liability Act 1855]], passed at the behest of the then Vice President of the Board of Trade, Mr. [[Robert Lowe]]. This allowed investors to limit their liability in the event of business failure to the amount they invested in the company – [[shareholder]]s were still liable directly to [[creditor]]s, but just for the unpaid portion of their [[share (finance)|shares]]. (The principle that shareholders are liable to the corporation had been introduced in the Joint Stock Companies Act 1844).

The 1855 Act allowed limited liability to companies of more than 25 members (shareholders). [[Insurance|Insurance companies]] were excluded from the act, though it was standard practice for insurance contracts to exclude action against individual members. Limited liability for insurance companies was allowed by the [[Companies Act 1862]].

This prompted the English periodical ''[[The Economist]]'' to write in 1855 that "never, perhaps, was a change so vehemently and generally demanded, of which the importance was so much overrated. "&lt;ref&gt;Graeme G. Acheson &amp; John D. Turner, ''The Impact of Limited Liability on Ownership and Control: Irish Banking, 1877–1914'', School of Management and Economics, Queen's University of Belfast, available at {{cite web|url=http://www.ehs.org.uk/ehs/conference2004/assets/AchesonTurnerPaper.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-11-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120113082939/http://www.ehs.org.uk/ehs/conference2004/assets/AchesonTurnerPaper.pdf |archivedate=2012-01-13 |df= }} and {{cite web|url=http://www1.fee.uva.nl/fm/conference/legal/ehr_2006_%20Acheson%20and%20Turner.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-11-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120111172110/http://www1.fee.uva.nl/fm/conference/legal/ehr_2006_%20Acheson%20and%20Turner.pdf |archivedate=2012-01-11 |df= }}.&lt;/ref&gt; The major error of this judgment was recognised by the same magazine more than 70 years later, when it claimed that, "[t]he economic historian of the future. . . may be inclined to assign to the nameless inventor of the principle of limited liability, as applied to trading corporations, a place of honour with [[James Watt|Watt]] and [[George Stephenson|Stephenson]], and other pioneers of the Industrial Revolution. "&lt;ref&gt;''Economist'', December 18, 1926, at 1053, as quoted in Mahoney, ''supra'', at 875.&lt;/ref&gt;

These two features – a simple registration procedure and limited liability – were subsequently codified into the landmark 1856 [[Joint Stock Companies Act 1856|Joint Stock Companies Act]]. This was subsequently consolidated with a number of other statutes in the Companies Act 1862, which remained in force for the rest of the century, up to and including the time of the decision in ''[[Salomon v A Salomon &amp; Co Ltd]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Salomon v A Salomon &amp; Co Ltd]]'' [1897] AC 22&lt;/ref&gt;

The legislation shortly gave way to a railway boom, and from then, the numbers of companies formed soared. In the later nineteenth century, depression took hold, and just as company numbers had boomed, many began to implode and fall into insolvency. Much strong academic, legislative and judicial opinion was opposed to the notion that businessmen could escape accountability for their role in the failing businesses.

====Further developments====
[[File:LordLindley cropp.jpg|thumb|right|[[Nathaniel Lindley, Baron Lindley|Lindley LJ]] was the leading expert on partnerships and company law in the ''[[Salomon v A Salomon &amp; Co Ltd|Salomon v. Salomon &amp; Co.]]'' case. The landmark case confirmed the [[corporate identity|distinct corporate identity]] of the company.]]
In 1892, [[Germany]] introduced the [[Gesellschaft mit beschränkter Haftung]] with a separate [[legal personality]] and limited liability even if all the shares of the company were held by only one person. This inspired other countries to introduce corporations of this kind.

The last significant development in the history of companies was the 1897 decision of the House of Lords in ''[[Salomon v A Salomon &amp; Co Ltd|Salomon v. Salomon &amp; Co.]]'' where the House of Lords confirmed the separate legal personality of the company, and that the liabilities of the company were separate and distinct from those of its owners.

In the [[United States]], forming a corporation usually required an act of legislation until the late 19th century. Many private firms, such as [[Andrew Carnegie|Carnegie]]'s steel company and [[John D. Rockefeller|Rockefeller]]'s [[Standard Oil]], avoided the corporate model for this reason (as a [[Trust law|trust]]). State governments began to adopt more permissive corporate laws from the early 19th century, although these were all restrictive in design, often with the intention of preventing corporations for gaining too much wealth and power.&lt;ref name="Corporate Law textbook"&gt;{{Citation|last1=Smiddy|first1=Linda O.|last2=Cunningham|first2=Lawrence A.|title=Corporations and Other Business Organizations: Cases, Materials, Problems|publisher=LexisNexis|year=2010|edition=Seventh|pages=228–31, 241|isbn=978-1-4224-7659-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[New Jersey]] was the first state to adopt an "enabling" corporate law, with the goal of attracting more business to the state,&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=ftzqaBv7X_sC&amp;pg=PA159&amp;lpg=PA159&amp;dq=%22new+jersey%22+%22first+state%22+%22business+corporation%22&amp;source=web&amp;ots=n5Af0liBo5&amp;sig=A2RRh_zOyS7W3CCMK4ZyG6Scmwk The Law of Business Organizations], Cengage Learning&lt;/ref&gt; in 1896. In 1899, Delaware followed New Jersey's lead with the enactment of an enabling corporate statute, but Delaware only became the leading corporate state after the enabling provisions of the 1896 New Jersey corporate law were repealed in 1913.&lt;ref name = "Corporate Law textbook"/&gt;

The end of the 19th century saw the emergence of [[Holding company|holding companies]] and corporate [[Mergers and acquisitions|mergers]] creating larger corporations with dispersed shareholders. Countries began enacting [[Competition law|anti-trust]] laws to prevent anti-competitive practices and corporations were granted more legal rights and protections.
The 20th century saw a proliferation of laws allowing for the creation of corporations by registration across the world, which helped to drive economic booms in many countries before and after World War I. Another major post World War I shift was toward the development of [[Conglomerate (company)|conglomerates]], in which large corporations purchased smaller corporations to expand their industrial base.

Starting in the 1980s, many countries with large state-owned corporations moved toward [[privatization]], the selling of publicly owned (or 'nationalised') services and enterprises to corporations. [[Deregulation]] (reducing the regulation of corporate activity) often accompanied privatization as part of a laissez-faire policy.

==Ownership and control==
A corporation is, at least in theory, owned and controlled by its members. In a [[joint-stock company]] the members are known as shareholders and each of their shares in the ownership, control, and profits of the corporation is determined by the portion of shares in the company that they own. Thus a person who owns a quarter of the shares of a joint-stock company owns a quarter of the company, is entitled to a quarter of the profit (or at least a quarter of the profit given to shareholders as dividends) and has a quarter of the votes capable of being cast at general meetings.

In another kind of corporation, the legal document which established the corporation or which contains its current rules will determine who the corporation's members are. Who a member is depends on what kind of corporation is involved. In a [[worker cooperative]], the members are people who work for the cooperative. In a [[credit union]], the members are people who have accounts with the credit union.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Principles of Finance |first1=Scott |last1=Besley |first2=Eugene |last2=Brigham |publisher=Cengage Learning |year=2008 |isbn=9780324655889 |edition=4th |page=105 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The day-to-day activities of a corporation are typically controlled by individuals appointed by the members. In some cases, this will be a single individual but more commonly corporations are controlled by a committee or by committees. Broadly speaking, there are two kinds of committee structure.
* A single committee known as a [[board of directors]] is the method favored in most [[common law]] countries. Under this model, the board of directors is composed of both executive and non-executive directors, the latter being meant to supervise the former's management of the company.
* A two-tiered committee structure with a [[supervisory board]] and a [[Vorstand|managing board]] is common in [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Company &amp; Commercial – Netherlands: In a nutshell – one-tier boards |date=10 April 2012 |publisher=International Law Office |url=http://www.internationallawoffice.com/newsletters/detail.aspx?g=f4815d3b-0de3-44d3-81d8-16114b49b8d8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Formation===
Historically, corporations were created by a charter granted by government. Today, corporations are usually registered with the state, province, or national government and regulated by the laws enacted by that government. Registration is the main prerequisite to the corporation's assumption of limited liability. The law sometimes requires the corporation to designate its principal address, as well as a [[registered agent]] (a person or company designated to receive legal service of process). It may also be required to designate an [[Law of agency|agent]] or other legal representative of the corporation.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

Generally, a corporation files [[articles of incorporation]] with the government, laying out the general nature of the corporation, the amount of stock it is authorized to issue, and the names and addresses of directors. Once the articles are approved, the corporation's directors meet to create [[By-law|bylaws]] that govern the internal functions of the corporation, such as meeting procedures and officer positions.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

The law of the jurisdiction in which a corporation operates will regulate most of its internal activities, as well as its finances. If a corporation operates outside its home state, it is often required to register with other governments as a [[foreign corporation]], and is almost always subject to laws of its host state pertaining to [[employment]], [[crime]]s, [[contract]]s, [[Lawsuit|civil actions]], and the like.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

===Naming===
Corporations generally have a distinct name. Historically, some corporations were named after their membership: for instance, "The President and Fellows of Harvard College". Nowadays, corporations in most jurisdictions have a distinct name that does not need to make reference to their membership. In Canada, this possibility is taken to its logical extreme: many smaller Canadian corporations have no names at all, merely numbers based on a registration number (for example, "12345678 Ontario Limited"), which is assigned by the provincial or territorial government where the corporation incorporates.

In most countries, corporate names include a term or an abbreviation that denotes the corporate status of the entity (for example, "Incorporated" or "Inc." in the United States) or the limited liability of its members (for example, "Limited" or "Ltd."). These terms vary by jurisdiction and language. In some jurisdictions, they are mandatory, and in others they are not.&lt;ref&gt;The U.S. state of California is an example of a jurisdiction that does not require corporations to indicate corporate status in their names, except for close corporations. The drafters of the 1977 revision of the California General Corporation Law considered the possibility of forcing all California corporations to have a name indicating corporate status, but decided against it because of the huge number of corporations that would have had to change their names, and the lack of any evidence that anyone had been harmed in California by entities whose corporate status was not immediately apparent from their names. However, the 1977 drafters were able to impose the current disclosure requirement for close corporations. See Harold Marsh, Jr., R. Roy Finkle, Larry W. Sonsini, and Ann Yvonne Walker, ''Marsh's California Corporation Law'', 4th ed., vol. 1 (New York: Aspen Publishers, 2004), 5–15 — 5–16.&lt;/ref&gt; Their use puts everybody on [[constructive notice]] that they are dealing with an entity whose [[legal liability|liability]] is limited: one can only collect from whatever assets the entity still controls when one obtains a judgment against it.

Some jurisdictions do not allow the use of the word "'''company'''" alone to denote corporate status, since the word "[[company]]" may refer to a partnership or some other form of collective ownership (in the United States it can be used by a [[sole proprietorship]] but this is not generally the case elsewhere).{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

==Personhood==
Despite not being individual human beings, corporations, as far as US law is concerned, are [[Legal personality|legal persons]], and have many of the same rights and responsibilities as [[natural person | natural persons]] do. For example, a corporation can own property, and can sue or be sued. Corporations can exercise [[human rights]] against real individuals and the state,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Human Rights of Companies: Exploring the Structure of ECHR Protection |first1=Marius |last1=Emberland |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2006 |isbn=978-0-19-928983-7 |page=1 |url=http://fds.oup.com/www.oup.co.uk/pdf/0-19-928983-2.pdf |accessdate=2 June 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120617104051/http://fds.oup.com/www.oup.co.uk/pdf/0-19-928983-2.pdf |archive-date=17 June 2012 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;e.g. [[South African Constitution]] Sect.8, especially Art.(4)&lt;/ref&gt; and they can themselves be responsible for human rights violations.&lt;ref&gt;Phillip I. Blumberg, The Multinational Challenge to Corporation Law: The Search for a New Corporate Personality, (1993) discusses the controversial nature of additional rights being granted to corporations.&lt;/ref&gt; Corporations can be "dissolved" either by statutory operation, order of court, or voluntary action on the part of shareholders. [[Insolvency]] may result in a form of corporate failure, when creditors force the liquidation and dissolution of the corporation under court order,&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, the Business Corporations Act (B.C.) [SBC 2002] CHAPTER 57, Part 10&lt;/ref&gt; but it most often results in a restructuring of corporate holdings. Corporations can even be convicted of criminal offenses, such as [[fraud]] and [[manslaughter]]. However, corporations are not considered living entities in the way that humans are.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. [[Corporate Manslaughter and Corporate Homicide Act 2007]]&lt;/ref&gt;

__NOTOC__
The '''Crown Minerals Act''' is an Act of Parliament passed in 1991 in [[New Zealand]]. It controls the management of Crown owed minerals. Potential changes to Schedule 4 of the Act created controversy and opposition in 2010. The definition of minerals under the Act is very broad - it includes gravel, industrial rocks, building stone, coal and petroleum. 

All gold, silver, uranium and petroleum is under Crown ownership as well as any other minerals that are on Crown owned land.&lt;ref name="guide"&gt;{{cite book|title=A guide to the Crown Minerals Act 1991|date=January 1992|publisher=Ministry of Commerce |location=NZ |isbn=0-478-00489-3 }}&lt;!--|accessdate=28 May 2010--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Schedule 4 Review==
In 2009 the [[Fifth National Government of New Zealand|National-led government]] announced that it would review Schedule 4 of the Act, a list of conservation areas for which access for mining cannot be granted by the [[Minister of Conservation (New Zealand)|Minister of Conservation]]. The proposal was condemned by critics not only because of the potential environmental impacts, but also because of the associated effects that were feared for the tourism industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10634013|title= NZ image about to be gutted 'surgically' |author=[[Robyn Malcolm]] |date=24 March 2010|work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]|accessdate=24 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Major NGOs such as [[Federated Mountain Clubs]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | publication-date = November 2009 | title = FMC Bulletin | periodical =  | publisher = Federated Mountain Clubs | volume =  | issue = 178 | url = http://fmc.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/2009_11_Bulletin_178.pdf | issn = 0110-6120 | accessdate = 9 August 2010 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100525112815/http://fmc.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/2009_11_Bulletin_178.pdf | archivedate = 25 May 2010 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Forest and Bird]] came out in opposition to the plans.

In March 2010 the government requested public feedback on a discussion document on the removal of 7000 ha of land from Schedule 4.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.med.govt.nz/templates/StandardSummary____42577.aspx|title=Schedule 4 stocktake|publisher=[[Ministry of Economic Development (New Zealand)|Ministry of Economic Development]]|accessdate=23 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was a record 37,500 submissions on the document. A protest March Against Mining was organised by [[Greenpeace NZ]] on 1 May in Auckland &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dontunderminenz.org|title=March Against Mining|publisher=Greenpeace NZ |accessdate=19 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it attracted an estimated 40,000 people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.radionz.co.nz/news/stories/2010/05/01/1248033a45ec|title=Thousands march in protest against mining|date=1 May 2010|publisher=[[Radio New Zealand]]|accessdate=1 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 20 July 2010 the Government announced that in response to receiving 37,552 submissions, the vast majority of which opposed mining, it will not remove any land from Schedule 4.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://www.beehive.govt.nz/release/no+land+be+removed+schedule+4 |title= No land to be removed from Schedule 4 |publisher=[[New Zealand Government]] |date=20 July 2010 |accessdate=20 July 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.med.govt.nz/sectors-industries/natural-resources/minerals/schedule-4-of-the-crown-minerals-act-1991/outcome-of-schedule-4-stocktake-process|title=Outcome of Schedule 4 stocktake process |publisher=Ministry of Economic Development|date=20 July 2010|accessdate= 1 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Proposed amendments==
In April 2013 a group of well-known New Zealanders including actress [[Lucy Lawless]], [[Geoffrey Palmer (politician)|Geoffrey Palmer]] and [[Anne Salmond]], as well as [[Greenpeace]] and [[Forest &amp; Bird]], said proposed amendments by the [[Crown Minerals (Permitting and Crown Land) Bill]] suggested by Energy and Resources Minister [[Simon Bridges]] were "a sledgehammer designed to attack peaceful protest at sea".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url= http://www.3news.co.nz/Prominent-NZers-fight-environmental-protest-ban/tabid/1160/articleID/293529/Default.aspx|work=3 News NZ |title= Prominent NZers fight sea protest ban| date= 9 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This Bill was passed as the [[Crown Minerals Amendment Act 2013]].

'''Crystal LED''' (CLED) refers to a manufacturing technology of screens. It was invented by [[Sony]] and revealed at CES 2012.

== Overview ==
This technology makes use of [[pixel]]s mounted on each segment [[RGB color model|RGB]] of the display, such that each pixel is illuminated independently. This makes it the first "true" LED display.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tomshardware.com/news/Sony-Crystal-LED-Display-Prototype-CES-2012-OLED,14464.html|title=Sony Intros 55-Inch Crystal LED Display Using 6 Million LEDs|publisher=Toms Hardware|accessdate=19 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=  https://www.techisignals.com/best-40-inch-tv-review/  |title= 40 Inch TVs }} Monday, 5 November 2018 &lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

=== 2012 ===
Sony unveiled Crystal LED display technology in the CES 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/247717/sony_shows_off_55_inch_crystal_led_hdtv.html|title=Sony Shows Off 55-Inch Crystal LED HDTV|work=PC World|accessdate=19 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.techradar.com/news/television/tv/hands-on-sony-crystal-led-tv-prototype-1055651|title=Hands on: Sony Crystal LED TV prototype|work=TechRadar|accessdate=19 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following year, the company was deciding between CLED and [[OLED]], and did not display CLED at the 2013 CES, but produced an OLED instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.techradar.com/us/news/television/tv/sony-to-choose-between-oled-and-crystal-led-1123759|title=Sony to choose between OLED and Crystal LED|work=TechRadar|accessdate=19 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2017 ===
At CES 2017 Sony showcased the CLEDIS ™ (Crystal LED Integrated Structure) with a Crystal LED video wall approximately 32 by 9 feet with a resolution of 8000 x 2000 pixel. According to Sony it is composed of single display modules measuring 17 7/8" (463.6mm) by 15 7/8" (403.2mm) each. The individual modules were not visible to the human eye. Due to the modular structure of the system theoretically any resolution and size could be possible according to a Sony representative.

'''Elections Canada''' ({{lang-fr|Élections Canada}}) is an independent, non-partisan agency reporting directly to the [[Parliament of Canada]]. Its ongoing responsibility is to ensure that Canadians can exercise their choices in [[elections in Canada|federal elections]] and [[Referendums in Canada|referendums]] through an open and impartial process. Elections Canada is the sole agency responsible for administering Canadian federal elections. 

==Mandate==
Its responsibilities include:
* Making sure that all voters have access to the electoral system
* Informing citizens about the electoral system
* Maintaining the [[National Register of Electors]]
* Enforcing electoral legislation
* Training election officers
* Producing maps of electoral districts
* Registering political parties, electoral district associations, and third parties that engage in election advertising
* Administering the allowances paid to registered political parties
* Monitoring election spending by candidates, political parties and third parties
* Publishing financial information on political parties, electoral district associations, candidates, nomination contestants, leadership contestants and third parties
* Supporting the independent commissions responsible for adjusting the boundaries of federal [[electoral district (Canada)|electoral districts]] every ten years
* Reporting to Parliament on the administration of elections and referendums

The [[House of Commons of Canada]] appoints the [[Chief Electoral Officer (Canada)|Chief Electoral Officer of Canada]] to head the agency. The Chief Electoral Officer in turn appoints the Commissioner of Canada Elections, who ensures that the ''[[Canada Elections Act]]'' is enforced; and the Broadcasting Arbitrator, who allocates paid and free broadcasting time during electoral events. The Chief Electoral Officer is seconded by the Deputy Chief Electoral Officer and Chief Legal Counsel and a staff of some 330 representing five executive directorates. During an election, staff at Elections Canada headquarters increases to 600 and to approximately 190,000 across Canada. Members of the general public are recruited to help run the election by manning polling stations, counting ballots, answering voters' questions, and providing other necessary services.

The '''Indochina Migration and Refugee Assistance Act''', passed on May 23, 1975, under President [[Gerald Ford]], was a response to the [[Fall of Saigon]] and the end of the [[Vietnam War]]. Under this act, approximately 130,000 [[refugee]]s from [[South Vietnam]], [[Laos]] and [[Cambodia]] were allowed to enter the [[United States]] under a special status, and the act allotted for special relocation aid and financial assistance &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Haines|first=David|title=Refugees in America in the 1990s: a reference handbook|year=1996|publisher=Greenwood Press|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Historical context ==
The end of the Vietnam War left millions of Southeast Asians displaced. In South Vietnam alone, the war had created over 6 million refugees from 1965 to 1971. Preceding May 1975, the United States policy for Southeast Asian refugee had been to assist by resettling them in safer areas of their home nations. As the war began to come to a close in early 1975, the State Department prepared an evacuation plan for U.S. forces as well as 18,000 Vietnamese refugees, but it quickly became apparent that this evacuation plan did not meet the incredible need of the refugees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Tempo|first=Carl|title=Americans at the Gate: The United States and Refugees during the Cold War|year=2008|publisher=Princeton University|location=Princeton}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the South Vietnam government rapidly deteriorated in April 1975, President Ford authorized an evacuation of up to 200,000 refugees.

== Enactment and provisions ==
The Indochina Migration and Refugee Act was signed on May 23, 1975, and allocated funding of $305 million for the [[Department of State]] and $100 million for the [[Department of Health, Education and Welfare]] for the resettlement of Vietnamese and Cambodian refugees in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/STATUTE-89/pdf/STATUTE-89-Pg89.pdf |title=Cambodian and Vietnamese Refugees - Special Assistance Appropriation - P.L. 94-24 |work=89 Stat. 89 |publisher=U.S. Government Printing Office |accessdate=26 Dec 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This act financed the transportation, processing, reception, and resettlement costs of more than 130,000 Vietnamese who had been evacuated from Vietnam during [[Operation Frequent Wind]] and who were granted parole by the [[United States Attorney General|Attorney General]] to enter the United States.

Most of the refugees were initially transported to [[Guam]] for processing (See [[Operation New Life]]) and then transported onward to temporary immigration centers set up at [[Eglin Air Force Base]], Florida; [[Camp Pendleton]], California; [[Fort Chaffee]], Arkansas; and [[Fort Indiantown Gap]], Pennsylvania. Although each refugee underwent a security check and could theoretically be denied admittance if he or she "violated a social norm, had a criminal record, or had offenses that were political in nature." However, involuntary repatriation to Vietnam was not an option. A team effort of dozens of immigration agencies aided in the resettlement process, including the [[United States Catholic Conference]], [[Church World Service]], [[International Rescue Committee]], [[Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society]], the [[Lutheran Immigration and Refugee Service]], the [[Tolstoy Foundation]], the [[American Council for Nationalities Service]], the [[American Fund for Czechoslovak Refugees]], the [[Travelers Aid International Social Service of America]], as well as several state and city service centers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Haines|first=David|title=Refugees in America in the 1990s: A Reference Handbook|year=1996|publisher=Greenwood Press|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1975, almost 130,000 refugees were paroled through this system, which finished its initial operations at Fort Chaffee in December of that same year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Marsh|first=Robert|title=Socioeconomic Status of Indochinese Refugees in the United States: Progress and Problems|journal=Social Security Bulletin|date=October 1980|volume=43|issue=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the first year of the Act had come to a close, it opened the doors for years of mass refugee acceptance.

== Opposition ==

Although many politicians thought it appropriate and necessary for the United States to provide a safe haven for those denied their human rights, some questioned the fairness of the Indochina Migration and Refugee Act for several reasons. Some, mostly conservative [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]], argued that the refugees would never be able to assimilate to American culture and would detract from the value system already in place. Other legislators, like Representative [[Frank Sensenbrenner]], were concerned with the price tag of committing so many immigrants, (roughly $1 billion per year) especially in a time of rising unemployment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Tempo|first=Carl|title=Americans at the gate: the United States and refugees during the Cold War|year=2008|publisher=Princeton University|location=Princeton}}&lt;/ref&gt; While many refugees were receiving financial assistance, economic success did not come easily and this usurpation of federal funding became an issue that not only lawmakers were paying attention too, but also the American public. Another group of opponents focused on the growing need of poor Americans. Representative [[John Conyers]] asked, "Should we be spending (federal dollars) on Vietnamese refugees or should we spend them on Detroit 'refugees?'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Marsh|first=Robert|title=Socioeconomic Status of Indochinese Refugees in the United States: Progress and Problems|journal=Social Security Bulletin|date=October 1980|volume=43|issue=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A last group of opponents believed that presidents Ford and [[Jimmy Carter|Carter]] were taking advantage of the parole system to allow mass numbers of people into the nation. In their eyes, the parole system should have been only used for people with specific cases, and certainly not for the processing of huge groups.

== Support ==

Senator [[Edward Kennedy]] and Representative [[Liz Holtzman]] were the leaders of the refugee advocacy community, and the first supporters of the 1975 Act. They were backed by labor groups like the [[AFL-CIO]] and religious services, including the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society and Church World Service. Their goals to redefine the legal notions of "refugee status" and attain a more comprehensive amnesty policy were not realized until the Refugee Act of 1980.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Tempo|first=Carl|title=Americans at the gate: the United States and refugees during the Cold War|year=2008|publisher=Princeton University|location=Princeton}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Implications ==

In response to the new need of welfare assistance to the new relocated refugees, the Indochinese Refugee Assistance Program was developed. This gave clearance for any Vietnamese, Cambodian, or Lao refugees to tap into the same resources that Cuban refugees had attained in the early 1970s, which included financial assistance and health, employment, and education services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Haines|first=David|title=Refugees in America in the 1990s: a reference handbook|year=1996|publisher=Greenwood Press|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Indochina Migration and Refugee Act was a watershed moment in U.S. Asian immigration policy. It opened the gates for displaced persons from Southeast Asia and also served as a symbol of commitment to those affected by the devastation from the Vietnam War. The decision by President Ford to admit such a substantial number of refugees was very much against public opinion and (despite attempts at thinning the refugee flow) the Carter Administration continued to commit thousands of refugees each year. By 1978, the U.S. was receiving thousands of refugees who had made their way by boat through the dangerous waters of the Pacific. This continued until refugee policy was reformed with the Refugee Act of 1980.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Tempo|first=Carl|title=Americans at the gate: the United States and refugees during the Cold War|year=2008|publisher=Princeton University|location=Princeton}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, because of the positive global reception to the Indochina Migration and Refugee Act of 1975, the United States has continued to use a more liberal approach to refugee admittance, especially with those from areas the United States is militarily engaged with.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Haines|first=David|title=Refugees in America in the 1990s: a reference handbook|year=1996|publisher=Greenwood Press|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; This ended in 2001 with the [[war in Afghanistan]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1831">The '''Integrated Circuit Topography Act''' ("An Act to provide for the protection of integrated circuit topographies and to amend certain Acts in consequence thereof", C-37) is legislation passed by the [[Parliament of Canada]] in 1990 that regulates the [[intellectual property]] of [[mask work|integrated circuit topographies]]. It came into force in 1993. The Act provides [[exclusive right]]s for the creator of the integrated circuit topography and remedies to deter infringement. The exclusive right is transferable. To receive the exclusive right to an integrated circuit topography the topography must be registered at the [[Canadian Intellectual Property Office]]. Between 1993 and 1999 there were about 38 registrations under the Act.

Integrated Circuit Topographies (ICT) are electronic integrated circuits or '''IC products''' that are configured and interconnected. These creations are protected in Canada by the Integrated Circuit Topography Act, which gives the creator exclusive rights for a period of ten years after registration. Because products containing these circuits are often exported outside Canada, Canada has reciprocal agreements with other countries that also protect the design for ten years.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3645">On December 11, 1941, [[Italy]] declared war on the [[United States]] in response to that country's [[United States declaration of war on Japan|declaration of war upon the Empire of Japan]] following the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] four days earlier. Germany also [[German declaration of war against the United States|declared war on the U.S.]] the same day. The US immediately responded by declaring war on Germany and Italy, thus thrusting the United States in fighting two major fronts across the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans in [[World War II]].

== Background == 
On December 7, 1941, 353 aircraft of the [[Empire of Japan]] attacked the U.S. [[naval base]] at [[Pearl Harbor]] and inflicted mass destruction to American life and property, beginning a war between Japan and the United States. On December 8, 1941, the U.S. declared war upon Japan in response to the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. Four days later, Italian dictator, [[Benito Mussolini]], made his declaration first - from the balcony over the [[Piazza Venezia]] in [[Rome]] - pledging the "powers of the pact of steel" were determined to win. Then [[Adolf Hitler]] made his announcement at the [[Reichstag (Nazi Germany)|Reichstag]] in [[Berlin]] saying he had tried to avoid direct conflict with the U.S. but, under the [[Tripartite Pact]] signed on 27 September 1940, Germany was obliged to join with Italy to defend its ally Japan. Hitler stated that, "After victory has been achieved, Germany, Italy and Japan will continue in closest co-operation with a view to establishing a new and just order."&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/december/11/newsid_3532000/3532401.stm 1941: Germany and Italy declare war on US]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Text of the declaration ==
This is another day of solemn decision in Italy’s history and of memorable events destined to give a new course to the history of continents.

The powers of the steel pact, Fascist Italy and Nationalist Socialist Germany, ever closely linked, participate from today on the side of heroic Japan against the United States of America.

The Tripartite Pact becomes a military alliance which draws around its colors 250,000,000 men determined to do all in order to win.

Neither the Axis nor Japan wanted an extension of the conflict.

One man, one man only, a real tyrannical democrat, through a series of infinite provocations, betraying with a supreme fraud the population of his country, wanted the war and had prepared for it day by day with diabolical obstinacy.

The formidable blows that on the immense Pacific expanse have been already inflicted on American forces show how prepared are the soldiers of the Empire of the Rising Sun.

I say to you, and you will understand, that it is a privilege to fight with them.

Today, the Tripartite Pact, with the plenitude of its forces and its moral and material resources, is a formidable instrument for the war and a certainty for victory.

Tomorrow, the Tripartite Pact will become an instrument of just peace between the peoples.

Italians! Once more arise and be worthy of this historical hour!

We shall win.&lt;ref&gt;[http://globalrhetoric.wordpress.com/italian-declaration-of-war-on-united-states-december-11-1941/ Mussolini: Italian Declaration of War on United States – December 11, 1941]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Facts==
Braithwait killed a man called Patrick Mahume unlawfully. He asked Lampleigh to ride to the King and petition for a pardon. Lampleigh was successful and, delighted, Braithwait promised £100 to Lampleigh; but he never paid up and Lampleigh sued. Braithwait said that because the service had been performed in the past, there was no good consideration at the time for the promise, regardless of the fact that Lampleigh was successful in securing a pardon.

==Judgment==
The Court of the King's Bench held that there was an implied understanding (i.e. implied assumpsit, or "assumption" of obligation) that a fee would be paid. Where a past benefit was conferred at the beneficiary's request, and where a reward would reasonably be expected, the promisor would be bound by his promise.

==Significance== 
In later centuries, judges have pondered some unsettled issues arising from this case. What if the promised £100 was insufficient? What if nothing was promised; would ''[[quantum merit]]'' be available?&lt;ref&gt;Case ref to follow shortly!&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''legislative council''' is the name given to the [[legislature]], or one of the legislative chambers of a nation, colony, or subnational division such as a province or state; or, in the United States, a council within a legislature which supervises nonpartisan legislative support staff.  A member of a legislative council is commonly referred to as an MLC.

==History==
In the [[British Empire]], the authority under which legislative councils have been constituted has varied: some under the prerogative, others by act of parliament, and some by commission and [[royal instructions]].&lt;ref&gt;Wright, Martin. Appendix 9 in "The Development of the Legislative Council 1606-1945", in the series "Studies in Colonial Legislatures" edited by [[Margery Perham]] of the Institute of Colonial Studies, Oxford, England (Faber &amp; Faber, 1946)&lt;/ref&gt;  Many are or were the [[upper house]] in a bicameral legislature and many had members who were appointed, not elected.

==United States==
In [[American English]], the term "legislative council" has acquired a slightly different meaning since the 1930s. Today, it refers to a joint committee with members from both houses of the state legislature, which supervises a staff of attorneys, accountants, and researchers charged with providing strictly nonpartisan support services to the legislature or to particular committees.&lt;ref name="Teaford"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Teaford|first1=Jon C.|title=The Rise of the States: Evolution of American State Government|date=2002|publisher=The Johns Hopkins University Press|location=Baltimore|isbn=9780801868894|pages=153–157|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Oosq_O1vDwcC&amp;pg=PA153|accessdate=August 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of the legislative council was first developed in [[Kansas]] and was implemented by the [[Kansas Legislature]] in 1933.&lt;ref name="Teaford" /&gt; Eventually, a majority of [[U.S. state]]s adopted legislative councils, but under a variety of names.&lt;ref name="Teaford" /&gt; Kansas still uses a legislative council, although it was converted into the Kansas Legislative Coordinating Council in 1971. Today, legislative councils actually operating under that name exist in the states of Arkansas, Arizona, Colorado, Montana, North Dakota, Texas, and Wisconsin.  Several states prefer to use the term "commission" for the same thing, including New Jersey and Nevada.

A few states, like California, have a "legislative counsel," not "council," who is appointed by a vote of the entire legislature and is thus responsible to the body as a whole rather than a "council" within it.

{{cite BAILII|litigants='''Lipkin Gorman v Karpnale Ltd'''|court=UKHL | year=1988 |num=12 |date={{date|1991-06-06}}}} is a foundational [[English unjust enrichment]] case. The [[Judicial functions of the House of Lords|House of Lords]] unanimously established that the basis of an action for money had and received is the principle of [[unjust enrichment]], and that an award of [[restitution]] is subject to a defence of [[change of position]]. This secured unjust enrichment [[English law]] as the third pillar of the [[law of obligations]], along with [[English contract law|contract]] and [[English tort law|tort]].  It has been called a [[landmark decision]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7bAnASISF3oC&amp;pg=PA103&amp;lpg=PA103&amp;dq=landmark+case+of+lipkin+gorman+v+karpnale&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=gZq1s-jHpm&amp;sig=dLK05cjb4jbOoWJRNZKHfNh8Kds&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwis2tSc_rvMAhVJHh4KHQATCJsQ6AEINzAE#v=onepage&amp;q=landmark%20case%20of%20lipkin%20gorman%20v%20karpnale&amp;f=false|title=Consequences of Impaired Consent Transfers |author=Birke Häcker |authorlink= Birke Häcker |publisher=Mohr Siebeck|isbn=978-3-16-149790-2|page=103}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the case is most famous for the transformative judgment handed down by the House of Lords in relation to restitution and unjust enrichment, the decision of the [[Court of Appeal of England and Wales|Court of Appeal]] is also an important banking law decision in its own right, setting out key principles relating to the [[duty of care]] owed by bankers to their customers.  There was no appeal against that part of the decision to the House of Lords.

==Facts==

Norman Barry Cass was a partner in a solicitors' firm called Lipkin Gorman. He was an authorised signatory at the firm’s [[Lloyds Bank (historic)|Lloyds Bank]] account. He took out £220,000 and used it for gambling at the [[Playboy Club]], 45 [[Park Lane, London]] which was owned by Karpnale Ltd. Between March and November 1980, the club won £154,695 of the stolen money (the rest paid back to Mr Cass in ‘winnings’). Mr Cass fled to Israel, but was brought back and sentenced to three years prison for theft in 1984. Lipkin Gorman sued the club for return of the stolen money. At the time, gambling contracts were contrary to public policy, and therefore [[void (law)|void]] under the [[Gaming Act 1845]] section 18.

[[John Alliott|Alliott J]] in the High Court, and then the Court of Appeal ([[Anthony May (judge)|May LJ]] and [[Jonathan Parker|Parker LJ]], but [[Donald Nicholls, Baron Nicholls of Birkenhead|Nicholls LJ]] dissenting), dismissed the majority of Lipkin Gorman's claims against the club (save only for a relatively small claim in [[conversion (law)|conversion]] relating to a bank draft).  Lipkin Gorman were partially successful against their bank in the High Court, but lost in the Court of Appeal on appeal and cross-appeal, and they abandoned their claim against the bank in the House of Lords.

==Judgments==
===First Instance===
The trial at first instance lasted three weeks and came before Alliot J.&lt;ref&gt;[1987] 1 WLR 987&lt;/ref&gt;  The Court of Appeal noted that the trial judge had a particularly complex task, trying to reconcile a large number of different pleaded causes of action together with complex and sprawling allegations of fact.

At first instance the claims were equally focussed upon the club and the firm's bankers (against whom the claimant solicitors pleaded both [[negligence]] and liability as [[constructive trust|constructive trustees]]).  Unusually, at the end of the plaintiff's case, the bank's counsel ([[Jonathan Sumption|Jonathan Sumption QC]]) made a submission of "[[no case to answer]]" and offered no evidence.  

Alliot J gave judgment against the club, but only for conversion of a bank draft for a relatively small amount.  The larger claim for [[money had and received]] failed.  Against the bank the judge made a stinging series of findings, including that "Mr Fox [manager of the bank] deliberately and systematically suppressed his knowledge of Cass' gambling from coming to his superior's notice", and that "Mr Fox deliberately lied to Mr Gorman."&lt;ref&gt;[1987] 1 WLR 987 at 1012&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Court of Appeal===

In the [[Court of Appeal of England and Wales|Court of Appeal]] all three judges gave reasoned judgments.  Both [[Anthony May (judge)|May LJ]] and [[Jonathan Parker|Parker LJ]] dismissed the claims of the firm against the club for money had and received on the basis that the club had provided good [[Consideration in English law|consideration]].  Although they accepted that gaming contracts were void, prior to the gambling the money was exchanged for chips, which were as good as cash inside the club for gambling or paying for drinks or other entertainment.&lt;ref&gt;Overturned on this point by the House of Lords.  However, the Court of Appeal noted that the [[Gaming Act 1968]], section 16(4) expressly provides that its provisions do not affect cheques accepted for games or tokens, a point not focussed upon by the Lords.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Although the judgment of Parker LJ considers the point in greater depth, the judgment of May LJ spends little over a page on this point ([1989] 1340 at 1349D to 1350E) which would engaged the House of Lords at considerably greater length.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the decision of the Court of Appeal is often overlooked because of the importance of the House of Lord's judgment, the judgments of the Court of Appeal on the issue of bank liability were not appealed, and remain the leading authority on the duty of care owed by a bank to its customer.  Unfortunately, the discussion of the issue in the Court of Appeal was complicated because of the way the plaintiff law firm's claim was pleaded and the offering of no evidence by the bank.  Nonetheless the comments of the Court of Appeal are important.

There were two broad claims against the bank: one as constructive trustee and other for negligence.  Each alleged that the bank knew or ought to have known that Cass was drawing on the firm's bank account for the purposes of satisfying his personal gambling problem, and yet they failed to take any action.&lt;ref&gt;It was noted that there was a certain irony to this pleading, as the firm finally became aware of what was transpiring on 1 October 1980.  Yet for nearly two months the firm did nothing as Cass continued to steal money from the firm for gambling.  See [1989] 1 WLR 1340 at 1359G.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Court of Appeal accepted counsel's submission that the bank could not be liable as constructive trustee if it was not shown to be at least negligent.&lt;ref&gt;[1989] 1 WLR 1340 at 1373D&lt;/ref&gt;  May LJ also asserted nothing less than actual knowledge should constitute a third party as constructive trustee.&lt;ref&gt;[1989] 1 WLR 1340 at 1355D.  Counsel considered the five stage scale set out by [[Peter Gibson|Peter Gibson J]] in ''Baden, Delvaux and Lecuit v Societe Generale'' [1983] BCLC 325, being (1) actual knowledge, (2) shutting one's eyes to the obvious, (3) wilfully and recklessly failing to make such inquiries as a reasonable and honest man would, (4) knowledge of circumstances which would indicate the facts to a reasonable and honest man, and (5) knowledge of circumstances that would put a reasonable and honest man on inquiry.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Court further held that the bank had not been negligent, and thus could not be liable as constructive trustee.  The Court noted the large number of cheques cleared daily, and that in this case only approximately one-seventh of the cheques drawn on the firm's account were fraudulent (and that the firm was one of over 2,800 customers of the bank branch).  May LJ held "There is nothing ... express or implied, which could require a banker to consider the commercial wisdom or otherwise of the particular transaction.  ... In my opinion any implied term requiring the banker to exercise care must be limited.  To a substantial extent the banker's obligation under such a contract is largely automatic or mechanical.  Presented with a cheque drawn in accordance with the terms of that contract, the bank must honour it save in what I would expect to be exceptional circumstances."&lt;ref&gt;[1989] 1 WLR 1340 at 1356A-B.  He want on to expound: "it is, in my opinion, only when circumstances are such that any reasonable cashier would hesitate to pay a cheque at one and refer it to his or her superior, and when any reasonable superior would hesitate to authorise payment without inquiry, that a cheque should not be paid immediately on presentation and such inquiry made.&lt;/ref&gt;

===House of Lords===
The House of Lords held that £150,960 should be repaid as money had and received, and the club was also liable for damages of £3,735 to the solicitors for conversion of a banker’s draft that had been used once for gambling, rather than cash.

[[Lord Templeman]] said, the money could be recovered.

{{Cquote|if they can show that in the circumstances the club was unjustly enriched at the expense of the solicitors… The club received stolen money by way of gift from the thief; the club, being a volunteer, has been unjustly enriched at the expense of the solicitors from whom the money had been stolen and the club must reimburse the solicitors.}}

[[Lord Goff]] said that the change of position defence was debated but

{{Cquote|the consensus being to the effect that such a defence should be recognised in English law. I myself am under no doubt that this is right.}}

==Significance==
As a result, the defence of change of position was recognized for the first time in English law and it succeeded as a partial defence here. Because the winnings have been paid out to Cass, the club has effectively changed its position and its liability is limited to the remaining sum of £150,960.

''Literary Journalism: A Biographical Dictionary of Writers and Editors'' (Greenwood, 1996), p. 160.&lt;/ref&gt;   She was also an anti-war activist during the [[Vietnam War]].&lt;ref&gt;Biography, ''Strictly Ghetto Property'' ("She worked with the National Mobilization Committee to End the War in Vietnam, and wrote for a series of underground newspapers: the ''Rat'' in New York, the ''Express Times'' and ''Dock of the Bay'' in San Francisco, the Berkeley ''Tribe''. She reported on Los Siete de la Raza for ''Hard Times'' and ''Ramparts'' magazine.") See, e.g., [http://www.thekingcenter.org/archive/document/letter-marjorie-heins-mlk-and-dora-mcdonald Letter from Marjorie Heins for the Mobilization], Sept. 14, 1967.&lt;/ref&gt;

===American Civil Liberties Union===
In the 1980s as staff counsel at the Massachusetts chapter of the [[American Civil Liberties Union]] (ACLU), Heins litigated numerous civil rights matters, including [[LGBT]] rights and [[free speech]]. One matter involved a litigation against [[Boston University]] for the discharge of the Dean of Students on the basis of her complaints about discrimination on the part of the university.&lt;ref&gt;Barbara Lightner, "[http://www.ioba.org/newsletter/archive/V8/Hines.html Interview with Marjorie Heins]", ''IOBA Standard'', v.3, no. 3 (Aug. 2002).&lt;/ref&gt; This story is told in ''Cutting the Mustard'' (1988).&lt;ref&gt;Heins, ''Cutting the Mustard''.&lt;/ref&gt; Heins also investigated the Boston Police Department's treatment of the notorious [[Charles Stuart (murderer)|Carol Stuart murder case]], in which a white man murdered his wife but claimed to be a victim of a carjacking by an African American man.&lt;ref name="cornell" /&gt;

From 1989-91, she served as editor-in-chief of the ''[[Massachusetts Law Review]].'' In 1991-92, she was chief of the Civil Rights Division at the Massachusetts Attorney General's Office.&lt;ref name=FEPPbio /&gt;&lt;ref name="wsj"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://online.wsj.com/article/PR-CO-20130515-909782.html|accessdate=February 27, 2014|title=Winners Announced for 2013 Hugh M. Hefner First Amendment Awards|date=May 15, 2013|author=[[Business Wire]]|work=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|publisher=Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She founded and directed the [[Arts Censorship Project]] at the [[American Civil Liberties Union]] from 1991-1998,&lt;ref name="wsj" /&gt; during the years in which [[arts censorship]] were a particularly controversial and active field. During that time, she worked on a number of high-profile arts censorship matters. Heins was co-counsel on the ACLU's ''[[Reno v. ACLU]]'' brief to the U.S. Supreme Court, which ultimately led to striking the [[Communications Decency Act]] as an unconstitutional violation of the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]]. Heins was also co-counsel on [[Karen Finley|Karen Finley's]] landmark lawsuit against the [[National Endowment for the Arts]], ''[[National Endowment for the Arts v. Finley]]''.&lt;ref name="hlsarts"&gt;{{cite web

At NYU, she taught "Censorship and American Culture."  At the American University of Paris, she taught "Free Expression and the Media: Policy and Law."&lt;ref name=FEPPbio /&gt;

{{Evidence law}}
'''Materiality''' is the significance of facts to the matter at hand.&lt;ref name=Black&gt;[[Black's Law Dictionary]], 7th ed.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In the law of evidence==
An item of [[Evidence (law)|evidence]] is said to be material if it has some logical connection to a fact of consequence to the outcome of a [[Legal case|case]].  Materiality, along with [[probative]] value, is one of two characteristics that make a given item of evidence [[Relevance (law)|relevant]].&lt;ref&gt;See Rule 401 of the [[Federal Rules of Evidence]].&lt;/ref&gt;  This largely depends on the elements of the [[cause of action]] the [[plaintiff]] seeks to prove, or that the [[prosecutor]] must prove in a [[criminal case]] to secure a conviction.  Which issues must be factually proven are therefore a product of the underlying [[substantive law]].&lt;ref&gt;Fisher, George.  ''Evidence''.  pp. 18-19. Foundation Press, 2002.  {{ISBN|1-58778-176-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In corporate and securities law==
Within the context of [[Corporate law|corporate]] and [[Securities regulation in the United States|securities law]] in the [[United States]], a fact is defined as material if there is a substantial likelihood that a reasonable [[shareholder]] would consider it important in deciding how to vote their shares or invest their money.&lt;ref&gt;Reasonable Investor(s), Boston University Law Review, available at: http://ssrn.com/abstract=2579510&lt;/ref&gt; In this regard, it is similar to the [[Materiality (auditing)|accounting term of the same name]].

Materiality is particularly important in the context of securities law, because under the [[Securities Exchange Act of 1934]], a company can be held civilly or criminally liable for false, misleading, or omitted statements of fact in [[proxy statement]]s and other documents, if the fact in question is found by the court to have been material pursuant to Rule 10b-5.&lt;ref&gt;See ''[[TSC Industries, Inc. v. Northway, Inc.]]'', 426 U.S. 438 (1976)&lt;/ref&gt;

==In contract law==
In the law of [[contract]]s, a ''material term'' in a contract is a term or provision that concerns significant issues, such as subject matter, price, quantity, type of work to be done, and terms of payment or performance.&lt;ref name=Black/&gt;

==In patent law==
In [[United States patent law]], information is material to patentability and therefore subject to the [[duty of disclosure]] if
:(1) It establishes, by itself or in combination with other information, a ''[[prima facie]]'' case of [[patentability|unpatentability]] of a [[patent claim|claim]]; or

'''Maximilian I''' (Ferdinand Maximilian Joseph Maria; 6 July 1832 – 19 June 1867) was the only monarch of the [[Second Mexican Empire]]. He was a younger brother of the [[Austrian emperor]] [[Franz Joseph I of Austria|Franz Joseph I]]. After a distinguished career in the Austrian Navy as its commander, he accepted an offer by [[Napoleon III]] of France to rule Mexico, conditional on a national plebiscite in his favour. France (along with the United Kingdom and Spain, who both withdrew the following year after negotiating agreements with Mexico's republican government) invaded the [[Second Federal Republic of Mexico|Mexican Republic]] in the winter of 1861, as part of the [[French intervention in Mexico|War of the French Intervention]]. Seeking to legitimize French rule in the Americas, Napoleon III invited Maximilian to establish a new Mexican monarchy. With the support of the French army and a group of [[Conservative Party (Mexico)|conservative Mexican]] monarchists hostile to the liberal administration of the new Mexican president, [[Benito Juárez]], Maximilian traveled to Mexico and declared himself [[Emperor of Mexico]] on 10 April 1864.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.royalark.net/Mexico/mexico4.htm Royal Ark]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Empire managed to gain recognition by several European powers including Britain, Austria, and Prussia.{{sfn|Harding|1934|pp=175}} The United States however, continued to recognize Juárez as the legal president of Mexico. Maximilian never completely defeated the Mexican Republic; Republican forces led by President Benito Juárez continued to be active during Maximilian's rule. With the end of the [[American Civil War]] in 1865, the United States (which had been too distracted by its own civil war to confront the Europeans' 1861 invasion of what it considered to be its [[sphere of influence]]) began more explicit aid of President Juárez's forces. Matters worsened for Maximilian after French armies withdrew from Mexico in 1866. His self-declared empire collapsed, and he was captured and executed by the Mexican government, which then restored the Mexican Republic.

His wife, [[Charlotte of Belgium]] (Carlota), who had left for Europe earlier to try to build support for her husband's regime, suffered an emotional collapse after his death and apparently became insane.&lt;ref&gt;New York Times, March 6, 1885|https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1885/03/06/102957723.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
===Birth===
Maximilian was born on 6 July 1832 in the [[Schönbrunn Palace]] in [[Vienna]], capital of the [[Austrian Empire]].{{sfn|Haslip|1972|p=6}}{{sfn|Hyde|1946|p=4}}{{sfn|Corti|1929|p=41}} He was baptized the following day as ''Ferdinand Maximilian Joseph''. The first name honored his godfather and paternal uncle, [[Ferdinand I of Austria|The King of Hungary]] and the second honored his maternal grandfather, [[Maximilian I Joseph of Bavaria|The King of Bavaria]].{{sfn|Haslip|1972|pp=6–7}}{{sfn|Hyde|1946|p=5}}

His father was [[Archduke Franz Karl of Austria|Archduke Franz Karl]], the second surviving son of [[Francis II, Holy Roman Emperor|The Emperor of Austria]], during whose reign he was born. Maximilian was thus a member of the [[House of Lorraine|House of Habsburg-Lorraine]], a female-line cadet branch of the [[House of Habsburg]].{{sfn|Palmer|1994|pp=3, 5}} His mother was [[Princess Sophie of Bavaria]], a member of the [[House of Wittelsbach]].{{sfn|Palmer|1994|p=3}} Intelligent, ambitious and strong-willed, Sophie had little in common with her husband, whom historian Richard O'Conner characterized as "an amiably dim fellow whose main interest in life was consuming bowls of dumplings drenched in gravy."{{sfn|O'Connor|1971|p=29}} Despite their different personalities, the marriage was fruitful, and after four miscarriages, four sons—including Maximilian—would reach adulthood.{{sfn|Haslip|1972|p=7}}

Rumors at the court stated that Maximilian was in fact the product of an extramarital affair between his mother and his first cousin [[Napoleon II of France|Napoleon II, The Duke of Reichstadt]], the only legitimate son of [[Napoleon|French Emperor Napoleon I]]; the Duke's mother was [[Marie Louise, Duchess of Parma]], former Empress of the French, Maximilian's aunt.{{sfn|Ridley|2001|p=44}} The existence of an illicit affair between Sophie and the Duke, and any possibility that Maximilian was conceived from such a union, are disputed by (mainly British) historians.{{ref label|specialnotes1|A|none}}

===Education===
Adhering to traditions inherited from the Spanish court during Habsburg rule, Maximilian's upbringing was closely supervised. Until his sixth birthday, he was cared for by Baroness [[Louise von Sturmfeder]], who was his ''aja'' (then rendered "nurse", now [[nanny]]). Afterwards, his education was entrusted to a tutor.{{sfn|Hyde|1946|pp=6–7}} Most of Maximilian's day was spent in study. The thirty-two hours per week of classes at age 7 steadily grew until it reached fifty-five hours per week by the time he was 17.{{sfn|Hyde|1946|p=7}} The disciplines were diverse: ranging from history, geography, law and technology, to languages, military studies, fencing and diplomacy.{{sfn|Hyde|1946|p=7}} In addition to his native [[German language|German]], he eventually learned to speak [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], [[Slovak language|Slovak]], [[English language|English]], [[French language|French]], [[Italian language|Italian]] and [[Spanish language|Spanish]].{{sfn|Hall|1868|p=17}} From an early age, Maximilian tried to surpass his older brother Francis Joseph in everything; attempting to prove to all that he was the better qualified of the two and thus deserving of more than second place status.{{sfn|Haslip|1972|p=17}}

The highly restrictive environment of the Austrian court was not enough to repress Maximilian's natural openness. He was joyful, highly charismatic and able to captivate those around him with ease. Although he was a charming boy, he was also undisciplined.{{sfn|Haslip|1972|p=11}} He mocked his teachers and was often the instigator of pranks—even including his uncle, Emperor [[Ferdinand I of Austria|Ferdinand&amp;nbsp;I]], among his victims.{{sfn|Haslip|1972|pp=14–15}} Nonetheless Maximilian was very popular. His attempts to outshine his older brother and ability to charm opened a rift with the aloof and self-contained Franz Joseph that would widen as years passed, and the times when both were close friends in childhood would be all but forgotten.{{sfn|Haslip|1972|p=17}}

In 1848, [[Revolutions of 1848|revolutions erupted across Europe]]. In the face of protests and riots, Emperor Ferdinand&amp;nbsp;I abdicated in favor of Maximilian's brother, who became Francis&amp;nbsp;Joseph&amp;nbsp;I.{{sfn|Haslip|1972|p=29}}{{sfn|Hyde|1946|p=13}} Maximilian accompanied him on campaigns to put down rebellions throughout the Empire.{{sfn|Haslip|1972|p=31}}{{sfn|Hyde|1946|p=13}} Only in 1849 would the revolution be stamped out in Austria, with hundreds of rebels executed and thousands imprisoned. Maximilian was horrified at what he regarded as senseless brutality and openly complained about it. He would later remark: "We call our age the Age of Enlightenment, but there are cities in Europe where, in the future, men will look back in horror and amazement at the injustice of tribunals, which in a spirit of vengeance condemned to death those whose only crime lay in wanting something different to the arbitrary rule of governments which placed themselves above the law."{{sfn|Haslip|1972|p=34}}{{sfn|Hyde|1946|p=14}}

==Career in the Austrian Navy==
===Commander in Chief===
[[File:Maximiliano 1852.png|thumb|left|2oopx|A beardless Maximilian at age 20, 1852]]
Maximilian was a particularly clever boy who displayed considerable culture in his taste for the arts, and he demonstrated an early interest in [[science]], especially [[botany]]. When he entered military service, he was trained in the [[Austro-Hungarian Navy|Austrian Navy]]. He threw himself into this career with so much zeal that he quickly rose to high command.&lt;ref&gt;Antonio Schmidt-Brentano'' The Austrian admirals'' Volume I, 1808–1895, Library Verlag, Osnabrück 1997, pp. 93–104.&lt;/ref&gt;

He was made a lieutenant in the navy at the age of eighteen. In 1854, he sailed as commander in the [[corvette]] ''Minerva'', on an exploring expedition along the coast of Albania and Dalmatia. Maximilian was especially interested in the maritime and undertook many long-distance journeys (for [[Brazil]]) on the [[frigate]] ''Elisabeth''.&lt;ref&gt;Ferdinand Maximilian of Austria Maximilian, Archduke of Austria:''From My Life Reiseskizzen, aphorisms, poems,'' Volume 6:.''Reiseskizzen'' Part 11 2 Edition. Duncker and Humblot, Leipzig, 1867&lt;/ref&gt; In 1854, he was only 22 years—as a younger brother of the Emperor, and thus a member of the ruling family—he was appointed as commander in chief of the Austrian Navy (1854–1861),&lt;ref&gt;Antonio Schmidt-Brentano: [http://www.oesta.gv.at/DocView.axd?CobId=23130 ''Die K.K bzw. K.u.K Generalität 1816–1918'']. Österreichisches Staatsarchiv, Wien 2007, S. 130 (PDF).&lt;/ref&gt; which he reorganized in the following years. Like [[Friedrich Ferdinand Leopold of Austria|Archduke Friedrich (1821–1847)]] before him, Maximilian had a keen private interest in the fleet, and with him the Austrian naval force gained an influential supporter from the ranks of the [[House of Habsburg|Imperial Family]]. This was crucial as sea power was never a priority of Austrian foreign policy and the navy itself was relatively little known or supported by the public. It was only able to draw significant public attention and funds when it was actively supported by an imperial prince. As Commander-in-Chief, Maximilian carried out many reforms to modernise the naval forces, and was instrumental in creating the naval port at [[Trieste]] and Pola (now [[Pula]]) as well as the battle fleet with which admiral [[Wilhelm von Tegetthoff]] would later secure his victories. He also initiated a large-scale [[SMS Novara (1850)#Novara Expedition|scientific expedition (1857–1859)]] during which the frigate [[SMS Novara (1850)|SMS ''Novara'']] became the first Austrian warship to [[circumnavigation|circumnavigate]] the globe.

===Viceroy of Lombardy-Venetia===
In his political views, Archduke Maximilian was very much influenced by the progressive ideas in vogue at the time. He had a reputation as a [[Liberalism|liberal]], and this was one of several considerations leading to his appointment as Viceroy of the [[Kingdom of Lombardy–Venetia]] in February 1857. Emperor Franz Joseph had decided on the need to replace the elderly soldier [[Joseph Radetzky von Radetz]] in this position; to divert growing discontent amongst the Italian population through token liberalization; and finally to encourage a degree of personal loyalty to the Habsburg dynasty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Victoria|last=Highes|pages=38–39|title=A Lurid Grandeur. Maximillian and Carlota of Mexico|ISBN=9-780692-723043}}&lt;/ref&gt;
  
On 27 July 1857, in [[Brussels]], Archduke Maximilian married his second cousin Princess Charlotte of Belgium, the daughter of [[Leopold I of Belgium|Leopold I]], [[King of the Belgians]], and [[Louise of Orléans]]. She was first cousin to both [[Queen Victoria]] and [[Albert, Prince Consort|Prince Albert]]. Maximilian and Charlotte had no children together.

They lived as the Austrian regents in [[Milan]] or [[Viceroy]]s of [[Kingdom of Lombardy–Venetia|Lombardy-Venetia]] from 1857 until 1859, when Emperor Francis Joseph, angered by his brother's liberal policies, dismissed him. Shortly after, Austria lost control of most of its Italian possessions. Maximilian then retired to [[Trieste]], near which he built the castle [[Miramare Castle|Miramare]]. At the same time the couple acquired a converted monastery on the island of [[Lokrum]] as a holiday residence. Both estates had extensive gardens, reflecting Maximilian's horticultural interests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Gene|last=Smith|pages=81–83|title=Maximillian and Carlotta|ISBN=0-688-00173-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Emperor of Mexico ==
===Offer of the Mexican crown===

[[File:Dell'Acqua Ernennung Maximilians zum Kaiser Mexikos.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Maximilian receiving a Mexican delegation at [[Miramare Castle]] in [[Trieste]]. Painting by Cesare dell'Acqua (1821-1905).]]
In 1859, Ferdinand Maximilian was first approached by Mexican monarchists—members of the [[Mexican Nobility|Mexican aristocracy]], led by local nobleman José Pablo [[Martínez del Río]]—with a proposal to become the Emperor of Mexico. The Habsburg family had ruled the [[Viceroyalty of New Spain]] from its establishment until [[War of Spanish Succession|the Spanish throne was inherited by the Bourbons]]. Maximilian was considered to have more potential legitimacy than other royal figures, but was unlikely to ever rule in Europe due to his elder brother.&lt;ref name="maxinmexico"&gt;[http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/10/04/maximilian-in-mexico/?hp Maximilian in Mexico]&lt;/ref&gt; On 20 October 1861 in Paris, Maximilian received a letter from [[José María Gutiérrez de Estrada|Gutierrez de Estrada]] asking him to take the Mexican throne. He did not accept at first, but sought to satisfy his restless desire for adventure with a botanical expedition to the [[Tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests|tropical forests]] of Brazil. However, Maximilian changed his mind after the [[Second French intervention in Mexico|French intervention in Mexico]]. At the invitation of [[Napoleon III]], after General [[Élie-Frédéric Forey]]'s capture of [[Mexico City]] and a French-staged [[plebiscite]] that confirmed the proclamation of the empire, Maximilian consented to accept the crown in October 1863.&lt;ref name="maxinmexico" /&gt; His decision involved the loss of all his rights of nobility in Austria, though he was not informed of this until just before he left. Archduchess Charlotte was thereafter known as "Her Imperial Majesty Empress Carlota".

===Reign in Mexico===
{{See also|Second Mexican Empire}}
In April 1864, Archduke Ferdinand Maximilian stepped down from his duties as Chief of Naval Section of the Austrian Navy. He traveled from [[Trieste]] aboard [[SMS Novara (1850)|SMS ''Novara'']], escorted by the frigates {{SMS|Bellona}} (Austrian) and [[French frigate Thémis (1862)|''Thémis'']] (French), and the Imperial yacht ''Phantasie'' led the warship procession from his palace at [[Miramare]] out to sea.&lt;ref&gt;Haslip, Joan, ''Imperial Adventurer – Emperor Maximilian of Mexico'', London, 1971, {{ISBN|0-297-00363-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; They received a blessing from [[Pope Pius IX]], and [[Queen Victoria]] ordered the Gibraltar garrison to fire a salute for Maximilian's passing ship.

The new emperor of Mexico landed at [[Veracruz (city)|Veracruz]] on 29 May 1864,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Gene|last=Smith|page=159|title=Maximillian and Carlotta|ISBN=0-688-00173-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; and received a cold reception from the townspeople. Veracruz was a liberal town, and the liberal voters were opposed to having Maximilian on the throne.{{sfn|Parkes|1960|p=261}} He had the backing of Mexican conservatives and [[Napoleon III]], but from the very outset he found himself involved in serious difficulties since the Liberal forces led by President [[Benito Juárez]] refused to recognize his rule. There was continuous warfare between his French troops and the Republicans.
[[File:Charlotte of Belgium.jpg|left|thumb|upright|[[Charlotte of Belgium|Empress Charlotte]]]]
The Imperial couple chose as their seat [[Mexico City]]. The Emperor and Empress set up their residence at [[Chapultepec Castle]], located on the top of a hill formerly at the outskirts of Mexico City that had been a retreat of [[Aztec]] emperors. Maximilian ordered a wide avenue cut through the city from [[Chapultepec]] to the city center; originally named ''Paseo de la Emperatriz'', it is today Mexico City's famous boulevard, ''[[Paseo de la Reforma]]''. He also acquired a country retreat at [[Cuernavaca]]. The royal couple made plans to be crowned at the [[Mexico City Metropolitan Cathedral|Catedral Metropolitana]] but, due to the constant instability of the regime, the coronation was never carried out. Maximilian was shocked by the living conditions of the poor in contrast to the magnificent haciendas of the upper class. Empress Carlota began holding parties for the wealthy Mexicans to raise money for poor houses. One of Maximilian's first acts as Emperor was to restrict working hours and abolish child labour. He cancelled all debts for peasants over 10 pesos, restored communal property and forbade all forms of corporal punishment. He also broke the monopoly of the Hacienda stores and decreed that henceforth peons could no longer be bought and sold for the price of their debt.

As Maximilian and Carlota had no children, they adopted [[Agustín de Iturbide y Green]] and his cousin [[Salvador de Iturbide y Marzán|Salvador de Iturbide y de Marzán]], both grandsons of [[Agustín de Iturbide]], who had briefly reigned as Emperor of Mexico in the 1820s. Iturbide and his cousin were granted the title ''Prince de Iturbide'' and style of ''Highness'' by imperial decree of 16 September 1865 and were ranked after the reigning family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite wikisource | title=Decreto Imperial del 16 de Septiembre de 1865 |wslanguage=es |language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; They intended to groom Agustín as heir to the throne. However, Maximilian never intended to give the crown to the Iturbides because he considered that they were not of royal blood.&lt;ref name=rosas /&gt; It was all a charade directed at his brother [[Archduke Karl Ludwig of Austria]], as he explained himself: either Karl would give him one of his sons as an heir, or else he would bequeath everything to the Iturbide children.&lt;ref name=rosas&gt;{{citation |title= Presidentes de México |author= José Manuel Villalpando, Alejandro Rosas |publisher= Grupo Planeta Spain |year= 2011 |isbn= 9786070707582 |pages=are not numbered |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=H2TbqVzLhOYC&amp;pg=PT326 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

To the dismay of his conservative allies, Maximilian upheld several liberal policies proposed by the Juárez administration – such as land reforms, religious freedom, and extending the right to vote beyond the landholding class. At first, Maximilian offered Juárez an amnesty if he would swear allegiance to the crown, even offering the post of Prime Minister, which Juárez refused.

After the end of the [[American Civil War]], the United States government used increasing diplomatic pressure to persuade Napoleon III to end French support of Maximilian and to withdraw French troops from Mexico. Washington began supplying partisans of Juárez and his ally [[Porfirio Díaz]] by "losing" arms depots for them at ''[[Ciudad Juárez|El Paso del Norte]]'' at the Mexican border. The prospect of a United States invasion to reinstate Juárez caused a large number of Maximilian's loyal adherents to abandon the cause and leave the capital.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Paul H. |last=Reuter |title=United States-French Relations Regarding French Intervention in Mexico: From the Tripartite Treaty to Querétaro |journal=Southern Quarterly |year=1965 |volume=6 |issue=4 |pages=469–489 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Monumento a Colón Paseo de la Reforma Ciudad de México.jpg|thumb|left|Maximillian planned the monument to Columbus for the grand boulevard, now called [[Paseo de la Reforma]]. It was built during the regime of [[Porfirio Díaz]].]]

Meanwhile, Maximilian invited ex-Confederates to move to Mexico in a series of settlements called the "Carlota Colony" and the [[New Virginia Colony]] with a dozen others being considered, a plan conceived by the internationally renowned U.S. Navy oceanographer and inventor [[Matthew Fontaine Maury]]. Maximilian also invited settlers from "any country" including Austria and the other German states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Rolle |first=Andrew F. |title=The Lost Cause: The Confederate Exodus to Mexico |location= |publisher=University of Oklahoma Press |year=1992 |isbn=0-8061-1961-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Maximilian issued his ''Black Decree'' on October 3, 1865. Its first article stated that: "All individuals forming a part of armed bands or bodies existing without legal authority, whether or not proclaiming a political pretext, whatever the number of those forming such band, or its organization, character, and denomination, shall be judged militarily by the courts martial. If found guilty, even though only of the fact of belonging to an armed band, they shall be condemned to capital punishment, and the sentence shall be executed within twenty-four hours". It is calculated that more than eleven thousand of Juarez's supporters were executed as a result of the ''Black Decree'', but at the end it only inflamed the [[Resistance movement|Mexican Resistance]].&lt;ref name=Milles&gt;{{citation |title= Cinco de Mayo: What is Everybody Celebrating? : the Story Behind Mexico's Battle of Puebla |author= Donald W. Miles |publisher= iUniverse |year= 2006 |isbn= 9780595392414 |page=196 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=ek-vNWcSt44C&amp;q=black+decree#v=snippet&amp;q=black%20decree&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Ridley&gt;{{citation |title= Maximilian and Juárez |author= Jasper Ridley |publisher= Constable |year= 1993 |isbn= 9780094720701 |page=229 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=59V6AAAAMAAJ&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=%2211%2C000+victims%22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, by 1866, the imminence of Maximilian's [[abdication]] seemed apparent to almost everyone outside Mexico. That year, Napoleon III withdrew his troops in the face of Mexican resistance and U.S. opposition under the [[Monroe Doctrine]], as well as increasing his military contingent at home to face the ever-growing [[Prussia]]n military and [[Otto von Bismarck|Bismarck]]. Carlota travelled to Europe, seeking assistance for her husband's regime in Paris and Vienna and, finally, in Rome from [[Pope]] [[Pope Pius IX|Pius IX]]. Her efforts failed, and she suffered a deep emotional collapse and never went back to Mexico. After her husband was executed by Republicans the following year, she spent the rest of her life in seclusion, never admitting her husband's death, first at [[Miramare Castle]] in [[Trieste]], Austria-Hungary, then Italy, and then at [[Bouchout Castle]] in [[Meise]], Belgium,&lt;ref name="NYTimes-6-mar-1885"&gt;"[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1885/03/06/102957723.pdf Charlotte of Mexico's Misfortune]", ''New York Times'', March 6, 1885.&lt;/ref&gt; where she died on 19 January 1927.&lt;ref name="NYTimes-19-jan-1927"&gt;"[https://www.nytimes.com/1927/01/20/archives/belgium-mourns-for-dead-empress-tragedy-of-life-of-charlotte-wife.html?sq=Charlotte%2520of%2520Mexico&amp;scp=10&amp;st=cse Belgium Mourns for Dead Empress; Tragedy of Life of Charlotte, Wife of Maximilian, Is Recalled]", ''New York Times'', January 19, 1927.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Downfall===
[[File:The Last moments of Maximilian.jpg|thumb|Last moments of Emperor Maximilian I of México. by [[Jean-Paul Laurens]]]]
[[File:Edouard Manet 022.jpg|thumb|[[Édouard Manet]]'s ''[[Execution of Emperor Maximilian]]'' (1868–1869), is one of five versions of his representation of the execution of the Austrian-born Emperor of Mexico, which took place on June 19, 1867. Manet borrowed heavily, thematically and technically, from Goya's ''[[The Third of May 1808]].]]

Though urged to abandon Mexico by Napoleon III himself, whose troop withdrawal from Mexico was a great blow to the Mexican Imperial cause, Maximilian refused to desert his followers. Maximilian allowed his followers to determine whether or not he abdicated. Faithful generals such as [[Miguel Miramón]], [[Leonardo Márquez]], and [[Tomás Mejía]] vowed to raise an army that would challenge the invading Republicans. Maximilian fought on with his army of 8,000 Mexican loyalists. Withdrawing, in February 1867, to [[Santiago de Querétaro]], he sustained a [[Siege of Querétaro|siege]] for several weeks, but on May 11 resolved to attempt an escape through the enemy lines. This plan was sabotaged by Colonel Miguel López who was bribed by the Republicans to open a gate and lead a raiding party, though with the agreement that Maximilian would be allowed to escape.
[[File:Photography of Execution of Maximilian I of Mexico, Miramón and Mejía — 1867.jpg|thumb|left|Execution of Mejía, Miramón and Maximilian. While no photograph was taken of the actual execution, an on-the-spot sketch made by eyewitness François Aubert indicates that this is an accurate reconstruction&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=M. M.|last=McAllen|page=386|title=Maximilian and Carlota. Europe's Last Empire in Mexico|ISBN=978-1-59534-263-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The city fell on 15 May 1867 and Maximilian was captured the next morning after the failure of an attempt to escape through Republican lines by a loyal [[hussar]] cavalry brigade led by [[Felix Salm-Salm]]. Following a [[court-martial]], he was sentenced to death. Many of the crowned heads of Europe and other prominent figures (including the eminent liberals [[Victor Hugo]] and [[Giuseppe Garibaldi]]) sent telegrams and letters to Mexico pleading desperately for the Emperor's life to be spared. Although he liked Maximilian on a personal level,&lt;ref name="Maximilian_and_Carlota"&gt;''Maximilian and Carlota'' by Gene Smith, {{ISBN|0-245-52418-5}}, {{ISBN|978-0-245-52418-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Juárez refused to commute the sentence in view of the Mexicans who had been killed fighting against Maximilian's forces, and because he believed it was necessary to send a message that Mexico would not tolerate any government imposed by foreign powers. [[Felix Salm-Salm]] and his wife masterminded a plan and bribed the jailors to allow Maximilian to escape execution. However, Maximilian would not go through with the plan because he felt that shaving his beard to avoid recognition would ruin his dignity if he were to be recaptured.{{sfn|Parkes|1960|p=273}} The sentence was carried out in the ''[[Cerro de las Campanas]]'' at 6:40am on the morning of 19 June 1867, when Maximilian, along with Generals Miramón and Mejía, were executed by a firing squad. He spoke only in Spanish and gave each of his executioners a gold coin not to shoot him in the head so that his mother could see his face. His last words were, "I forgive everyone, and I ask everyone to forgive me. May my blood, which is about to be shed, be for the good of the country. Viva Mexico, viva la independencia!"&lt;ref&gt;Giving executer(s) a portion of gold/silver is well-established among European aristocracy since medieval time and not an act of desperation. In other accounts, Maximilian calmly said, "aim well", to the firing squad and met his death with dignity.&lt;/ref&gt; Generals Miramón and Mejía standing to Maximilian's right, were killed by the same volley as the emperor, fired by the fifteen-man (twenty-one in other accounts) execution party. Maximilian and Miramón died almost immediately, the emperor calling out the single word ''hombre'', but Mejía's death was a more extended one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=M.

==Burial==
[[File:Francois Aubert 2.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Maximilian's embalmed body]]
After his execution, Maximilian's body was embalmed and displayed in Mexico. Early the following year, the Austrian admiral [[Wilhelm von Tegetthoff]] was sent to Mexico aboard [[SMS Novara (1850)|SMS ''Novara'']] to take the former emperor's body back to Austria. After arriving in Trieste, the coffin was taken to [[Vienna, Austria|Vienna]] and placed within the [[Imperial Crypt]], on 18 January 1868, where it can be viewed today.

The [[Emperor Maximilian Memorial Chapel]] was constructed on the hill where his execution took place.

Juárez holds a [[Mexican flag]] with one hand and with the other is pointing Maximilian's [[Imperial Crown of Mexico]] which remains in the soil, representing the defeat of the [[Second Mexican Empire]].]]
Maximilian has been praised by some historians for his liberal reforms, genuine desire to help the people of Mexico, refusal to desert his loyal followers, and personal bravery during the siege of Querétaro. Other researchers consider him short-sighted in political and military affairs, and unwilling to restore democracy in Mexico even during the imminent collapse of the [[Second Mexican Empire]]. Today, anti-republican and anti-liberal far right groups who advocate the Second Mexican Empire, such as the [[Nationalist Front of Mexico]], are reported to gather every year in Querétaro to commemorate the execution of Maximilian and his followers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nacionalistas.org/2012/06/homenaje-los-martires-del-segundo.html |title=Homage to the Martyrs of the Second Mexican Empire |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140503115911/http://www.nacionalistas.org/2012/06/homenaje-los-martires-del-segundo.html |archivedate=2014-05-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Maximilian is portrayed in the 1934 Mexican film ''[[Juárez y Maximiliano]]'' by [[Enrique Herrera (actor)|Enrique Herrera]] and the 1939 American film ''[[Juarez (film)|Juarez]]'' by [[Brian Aherne]]. He also appeared in one scene in the 1954 American film ''[[Vera Cruz (film)|Vera Cruz]]'', played by [[George Macready]]. In the Mexican [[telenovela]] "El Vuelo del Águila", Maximilian was portrayed by Mexican actor [[Mario Iván Martínez]].
&lt;ref&gt;[[:es:El vuelo del águila]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the wake of his death, [[carte-de-visite]] cards with photographs commemorating his execution circulated both among his followers and among those who wished to celebrate his death. One such card featured a photograph of the shirt he wore to his execution, riddled with bullet holes.&lt;ref&gt;Laughlin, Eleanor A.

'''MillerCoors''' is a [[brewing|beer brewing]] company in the United States.  In 2002 [[South African Breweries]] purchased [[Miller Brewing Company]] to create [[SABMiller]].  In 2005, [[Molson Brewery]] of Canada and [[Coors Brewing Company]] merged to form the [[Molson Coors Brewing Company]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.denverpost.com/2016/10/11/molson-coors-claims-millercoors/|title=Molson Coors claims all of MillerCoors, making home-grown brewer the third largest in the world|date=2016-10-12|work=The Denver Post|access-date=2018-01-02|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Then, in 2008, SABMiller and Molson Coors created MillerCoors as a joint venture for their operations in the U.S.&lt;ref name="Wright"&gt;{{cite news |last=Wright |first=Lisa |date=November 11, 2015 |title=Molson Coors doubles with $12B Miller buyout |url=https://www.thestar.com/business/2015/11/11/molson-coors-doubles-with-12b-miller-buyout.html |newspaper=Toronto Star |location=Toronto |access-date=January 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company is the second-largest brewer in the U.S., after [[Anheuser-Busch]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=March 15, 2017 |url=https://www.brewersassociation.org/press-releases/brewers-association-releases-top-50-breweries-of-2016/ |title=Brewers Association Releases Top 50 Breweries of 2016 |website=Brewers Association |access-date=April 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These component companies had very different backgrounds. Miller Brewing was started in 1855 by settler Frederick Miller who had been studying the making of beer for years; he first owned Plank Road Brewery before opening the first Miller Company in Milwaukee. The original [[Molson Brewery]] was started by [[John Molson]] in Montreal, Canada in 1786. [[Coors Brewing Company]] was started by Adolph Coors, who emigrated from Prussia, in Colorado in 1873 and went through several name changes over the years until it was acquired by Molson's in 2004, becoming [[Molson Coors Brewing Company]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.molsoncoors.com/en/our-story/our-markets/millercoors |title=Our Story |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=2017 |website=Miller Coors |publisher=Molson Coors division, Molson Coors |access-date=January 31, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 11, 2016, SABMiller sold its stake in MillerCoors for around US $12 billion after the company was acquired by Anheuser-Busch InBev, making Molson Coors the 100 per cent owner of MillerCoors.&lt;ref name="Brown"&gt;{{cite news |last=Brown |first=Lisa |date=October 11, 2016  |title=A-B InBev finalizes $100B billion acquisition of SABMiller, creating world's largest beer company |url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/business/ct-megabrew-ab-inbev-sabmiller-merger-20161010-story.html |newspaper=Chicago Tribune |location=Chicago |access-date=January 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In effect, MillerCoors became the "U.S. business unit of Molson Coors."&lt;ref name="Dill"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.biztimes.com/2016/10/10/anheuser-busch-to-complete-acquisition-of-sabmiller-today/ |title=Anheuser-Busch to complete acquisition of SABMiller today |last=Dill |first=Molly |date=10 October 2016 |website=BizTimes |publisher=BizTimes Media LLC |access-date=31 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Canada, Molson Coors regained the right (from SABMiller) to make and market Miller Genuine Draft and Miller Lite.&lt;ref name="Wright" /&gt;

Molson Coors plans to keep the MillerCoors name and the Chicago headquarters and plans to operate it in much the same way as before October 11, 2016.&lt;ref name="Dill"/&gt; For the consumer, and for employees, the change to 100 percent ownership (from the previous 42 percent) by Molson Coors will not be apparent, according to Jon Stern, MillerCoors' director of media relations. "The good news is that none of this impacts Milwaukee or Wisconsin. It'll be business as usual. Miller Lite, Coors light, Miller High Life and Leinenkugel's -- and frankly all the rest of our brands will continue to be brewed by us."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://fox6now.com/2016/10/10/mega-merger-anheuser-busch-inbevs-takeover-of-sabmiller-to-become-official/ |title=Mega-merger: Anheuser-Busch InBev’s takeover of SABMiller is now official |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=October 10, 2016 |website=FOX 6 Now |publisher=Tribune Broadcasting |access-date=February 2, 2017 |quote=As for what this means for workers in Milwaukee, Stern said there's not much overlap between Molson Coors and MillerCoors.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Operations==
MillerCoors is the US businesses of Molson Coors and employs around 17,400 people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/companies/molson-coors-brewing/|title=Molson Coors Brewing on the Forbes Just Companies List|work=Forbes|access-date=2018-01-02|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The U.S. company brews, markets and sells the MillerCoors portfolio of brands in the U.S. and [[Puerto Rico]]. MillerCoors operates eight major breweries in the U.S., as well as the Leinenkugel's craft brewery in [[Chippewa Falls, Wisconsin]], and three [[Microbrewery|microbreweries]]: the 10th Street Brewery in [[Milwaukee]], Terrapin Beer Co. in [[Athens, GA]] and the Blue Moon Brewing Company at [[Coors Field]] in Denver.

==History==
MillerCoors was announced as a joint venture between [[SABMiller]] and Molson Coors in October 2007 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Martin |first=Andrew |title=Merger for SABMiller and Molson Coors |work=[[New York Times]] | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/10/business/worldbusiness/10beer.html | date=October 10, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was approved by regulators on June 5, 2008. The venture was completed on June 30, 2008 and MillerCoors began operation on July 1, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Daykin |first=Tom |title=U.S. signs off on Miller, Coors merger |work=[[Milwaukee Journal Sentinel]] |date=2008-06-05 |url=http://www.jsonline.com/watch/?watch=1&amp;date=6/5/2008&amp;id=40816 |accessdate=2008-06-05 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080803031843/http://www.jsonline.com/watch/?watch=1&amp;date=6%2F5%2F2008&amp;id=40816 |archivedate=2008-08-03 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 14, 2015, Miller Coors announced that it would shut down its Eden, NC brewery in September 2016 due to declining corporate sales. The company has newer plants in Virginia and Georgia that will serve the Eden plant's distribution area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.journalnow.com/business/business_news/local/millercoors-to-close-eden-brewery-in-september/article_030e463b-1002-530e-abee-d552d420bfdc.html|title=MillerCoors to close Eden brewery in September 2016|last=Craver|first=Richard|work=[[Winston-Salem Journal]]|date=2016-09-15|accessdate=2016-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2016, the ''[[Milwaukee Journal Sentinel]]'' reported that [[Pabst Brewing Company]] and Blue Ribbon Intermediate Holdings filed a lawsuit because Pabst wanted to continue making its beers in Eden.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.greensboro.com/business/local_business/pabst-s-sues-millercoors-about-eden-closure/article_1ca2663f-0913-557b-bc86-bbb66ae0144e.html|title=Pabst's sues MillerCoors about Eden closure|last=Davis|first=Jonnellle|work=[[News &amp; Record]]|date=2016-05-16|accessdate=2016-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sole ownership by Molson Coors===

During the merger discussions between [[Anheuser-Busch InBev]] and [[SABMiller]] in 2015,
the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) had agreed to proposed deal only on the basis that SABMiller "spins off all its MillerCoors holdings in the U.S. — which include both Miller- and Coors-held brands — along with its Miller brands outside the U.S." The entire ownership situation was complicated: "In the United States, Coors is majority owned [58%]by MillerCoors (a subsidiary of SABMiller) and minority owned by Molson Coors, though internationally it's entirely owned by Molson Coors, and Miller is owned by SABMiller."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/taranurin/2016/07/20/doj-approves-largest-beer-merger-in-global-history/#1c050c1a21ab |title=DOJ Approves Largest Beer Merger In Global History, With Significant Conditions |last=Nurin |first=Tara |date=July 20, 2016  |website=Forbes |publisher=Forbes |access-date=January 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; SABMiller agreed to divest itself of the Miller brands. by selling its stake in MillerCoors to [[Molson Coors]].&lt;ref name="Brown"/&gt;

After the merger on October 10, 2016 was concluded, SABMiller sold to [[Molson Coors]] full ownership of the Miller brand portfolio outside of the U.S. and Puerto Rico for US$12 billion. Molson Coors also retained "the rights to all of the brands currently in the MillerCoors portfolio for the U.S. and Puerto Rico, including Redd's and import brands such as Peroni, Grolsch and Pilsner Urquell." The agreement made Molson Coors the world's third largest brewer.&lt;ref name="acq"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.molsoncoors.com/en/news/molson-coors-completes-acquisition-of-millercoors-and-global-miller-brand-portfolio |title= Molson Coors Completes Acquisition of Full Ownership of MillerCoors and Global Miller Brand Portfolio |date= October 11, 2016 |website= Molson Coors |publisher=Molson Coors |access-date= January 29, 2017 |quote= Becomes World's Third Largest Brewer by Enterprise Value and Strengthens Position in Highly Attractive U.S. Beer Market}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company is now also the largest brewer in the U.S.&lt;ref name="Dill"/&gt;

The Molson Coors press release provides a summary of the net effect in terms of the Miller portfolio. "As part of the transaction, Molson Coors gains full ownership of the Miller brand portfolio outside of the U.S. and Puerto Rico, and retains the rights to all of the brands currently in the MillerCoors portfolio for the U.S. and Puerto Rico, including Redd's and import brands such as Peroni, Grolsch and Pilsner Urquell."&lt;ref name=acq/&gt;

In the U.S., the change is merely one of ownership (from 42 percent to 100 percent by Molson Coors), and that will not be relevant or apparent to consumers or to MillerCoors employees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://fox6now.com/2016/10/10/mega-merger-anheuser-busch-inbevs-takeover-of-sabmiller-to-become-official/ |title=Mega-merger: Anheuser-Busch InBev’s takeover of SABMiller is now official |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= October 10, 2016 |website=FOX 6 Now |publisher=Tribune Broadcasting |access-date=February 2, 2017 |quote=As for what this means for workers in Milwaukee, Stern said there's not much overlap between Molson Coors and MillerCoors.}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the company was planning to increase investment in several of its brands, including new national marketing and advertising campaigns, to increase sales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chicagobusiness.com/article/20161011/NEWS07/161019965/how-the-new-reorg-will-and-wont-change-millercoors |title=How the new reorg will—and won't—change MillerCoors |last=Frost |first=Peter J |date=October 11, 2016 |website= Chicago Business |publisher= Crain Communication, Inc. |access-date= February 2, 2017 |quote=We're now the third-largest brewery in the world, and we're now the biggest American-owned brewer.

&lt;!-- No bolding per WP:BOLDTITLE --&gt;At a summit in [[Minsk]] on 11 February 2015, the leaders of [[Ukraine]], [[Russia]], [[France]], and [[Germany]] agreed to a package of measures to alleviate the ongoing [[war in eastern Ukraine]].&lt;ref name="BBC12FEB"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GD12FEB"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/feb/12/ukraine-crisis-reports-emerge-of-agreement-in-minsk-talks | title=Ukraine ceasefire deal agreed at Belarus talks | work=The Guardian | date=12 February 2015 | accessdate=12 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=E1345&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.euronews.com/2015/02/12/breakthrough-in-minsk-as-leaders-agree-to-ceasefire-deal-on-ukraine/|title=Breakthrough in Minsk as leaders agree to ceasefire deal on Ukraine|work=Euronews|date=12 February 2015|accessdate=12 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="OSCE12FEB"&gt;{{cite press release | url=http://www.osce.org/cio/140196 | title=OSCE Chairperson-in-Office gives full backing to Minsk package | publisher=Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe | date=12 February 2015 | accessdate=12 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The talks that led to the deal, overseen by the [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe]] (OSCE), were organised in response to the collapse of the [[Minsk Protocol]] ceasefire in January–February 2015. The new package of measures is intended to revive the Protocol, which had been agreed to on 5 September 2014.

==Summit and drafting==
Successive attempts to resolve the [[War in Donbass|ongoing war]] in the [[Donbass]] region of Ukraine had seen no result by the start of February 2015.&lt;ref name="BB12FEB225f"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-02-12/ukrainian-cease-fire-sealed-after-all-night-minsk-peace-summit | title=EU Stands by Sanctions Against Russia After Ukraine Truce Sealed | work=Bloomberg News | date=12 February 2015 | accessdate=12 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the [[Minsk Protocol]] of 5 September 2014 did significantly reduce fighting in the conflict zone for many months, minor skirmishes continued. At the start of January 2015, the separatist forces of the [[Donetsk People's Republic]] (DPR) and [[Lugansk People's Republic]] (LPR) began a new offensive on Ukrainian-controlled areas, resulting in the complete collapse of the Minsk Protocol ceasefire.&lt;ref name="GD21JAN"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jan/21/russia-ukraine-war-fighting-east | title=Ukraine forces admit loss of Donetsk airport to rebels | work=The Guardian | date=21 January 2015 | accessdate=23 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; After heavy fighting, DPR forces [[Second Battle of Donetsk Airport|captured]] the symbolically important [[Donetsk International Airport]] on 21 January, the last part of the city of [[Donetsk]] that had been under Ukrainian control. Following this victory, separatist forces [[Battle of Debaltseve|pressed their offensive]] on the important railway and road junction of [[Debaltseve]] in late January. This renewed heavy fighting caused significant concern in the international community. French president [[François Hollande]] and German chancellor [[Angela Merkel]] put forth a new peace plan on 7 February. The Franco-German plan, drawn up after talks with Ukrainian president [[Petro Poroshenko]] and Russian president [[Vladimir Putin]], was seen as a revival of the [[Minsk Protocol]]. President Hollande said that the plan was the "last chance" for resolution of the conflict.&lt;ref name="7FEB2052"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-31185027 | title=Ukraine crisis: 'Last chance' for peace says Hollande | publisher=BBC News | date=7 February 2015 | accessdate=7 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wew223"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-02-07/putin-rejects-attempts-to-contain-russia-after-peace-talks-fail | title=Putin Rejects Attempts to Contain Russia After Peace Talks Fail | work=Bloomberg News | date=7 February 2015 | accessdate=7 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The plan was put forth in response to American proposals to send armaments to the Ukrainian government, something that Chancellor Merkel said would only result in a worsening of the crisis.&lt;ref name="7FEB2052" /&gt;&lt;ref name="7FEBNYT"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/08/world/europe/divisions-on-display-over-western-response-to-ukraine-at-security-conference.html | title=Western Nations Split on Arming Kiev | work=The New York Times | date=7 February 2015 | accessdate=7 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A summit to discuss the implementation of the Franco-German diplomatic plan was scheduled for 11 February at [[Independence Palace, Minsk|Independence Palace]] in [[Minsk]], the capital of [[Belarus]]. It was attended by Russian president Vladimir Putin, Ukrainian president Petro Poroshenko, [[German chancellor]] Angela Merkel, French president François Hollande, DPR leader [[Alexander Zakharchenko]], and LPR leader [[Igor Plotnitsky]]. Negotiations went on overnight for sixteen hours, and were said to have been "very difficult" by the [[Frank-Walter Steinmeier|German foreign minister]].&lt;ref name="12FEG22"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2015/02/12/us-ukraine-crisis-idUSKBN0LG0FX20150212 | title='Glimmer of hope' for Ukraine after deal at Minsk peace summit | agency=Reuters | date=12 February 2015 | accessdate=12 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="UYH#52"&gt;{{cite news|first1=Alexandra|last1=Hudson|author2=Madeline Chambers|url=https://www.yahoo.com/news/german-min-minsk-deal-not-wished-101526732.html?ref=gs|title=German foreign minister: Minsk deal not all we would have wished for|publisher=Yahoo News|date=12 February 2015|agency=Reuters|accessdate=21 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the talks, it was announced on 12 February that the parties to the conflict had agreed to a new package of peacemaking measures.&lt;ref name="OSCE12FEB"/&gt; Some of the measures agreed to were an OSCE-observed unconditional ceasefire from 15 February, withdrawal of heavy weapons from the front line, release of prisoners of war, and constitutional reform in Ukraine.&lt;ref name="WSJ12FEBY"&gt;{{cite news|first1=Andrey|last1=Ostroukh|author2=Gregory L.

===Elections in the DPR and LPR===
While the [[Ukrainian local elections, 2015|2015 Ukrainian local elections]] had been scheduled for 25 October, DPR leader [[Alexander Zakharchenko]] issued a decree on 2 July that ordered local DPR elections to be held on 18 October.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.kyivpost.com/content/ukraine/poroshenko-says-local-elections-in-ukraine-will-be-held-on-oct-25-date-on-which-they-will-be-held-in-donbas-is-hard-to-predict-390837.html|title=Poroshenko says local elections in Ukraine will be held on Oct. 25, date on which they will be held in Donbas is hard to predict|newspaper=[[Kyiv Post]]|agency=Interfax|date=11 June 2015|accessdate=21 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He said that this action was "in accordance with the Minsk agreements".&lt;ref name=zak1810led&gt;{{cite news|url=http://en.interfax.com.ua/news/general/275451.html|title=Local elections in DPR to take place on October 18 – Zakharchenko|publisher=[[Interfax-Ukraine]]|date=2 July 2015|accessdate=21 October 2016}}&lt;br&gt;{{cite news|url=http://en.interfax.com.ua/news/general/275646.html|title=DPR, LPR attempts to hold separate elections in Donbas on Oct 18 to have destructive consequences – Poroshenko|publisher=[[Interfax-Ukraine]]|date=2 July 2015|accessdate=21 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Zakharchenko, this move meant that the DPR had "independently started to implement the Minsk agreements".&lt;ref name=zak1810led/&gt; Zakharchenko said that the elections would "take place 'on the basis of Ukraine's law on temporary self-rule status of individual districts of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions', in so far as they are not at variance with the constitution and laws of the DPR".&lt;ref name=zak1810led/&gt;

The '''[[Montreux]] Convention Regarding the Regime of the Straits''' is a 1936 agreement that gives [[Turkey]] control over the [[Bosporus|Bosporus Straits]] and the [[Dardanelles]] and regulates the transit of naval warships. The Convention gives Turkey full control over the Straits and guarantees the free passage of civilian vessels in peacetime. It restricts the passage of naval ships not belonging to Black Sea states. The terms of the convention have been the source of controversy over the years, most notably about the [[Soviet Union]]'s [[Soviet Armed Forces|military]] access to the [[Mediterranean Sea]].

Signed on 20 July 1936 at the [[Montreux Palace]] in Switzerland,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fairmont.com/montreux/hotel-history/ |title=Le Montreux Palace over the years |publisher=Fairmont.com |date= |accessdate=2014-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; it permitted Turkey to remilitarise the Straits. It went into effect on 9 November 1936 and was registered in ''League of Nations Treaty Series'' on 11 December 1936.&lt;ref&gt;''League of Nations Treaty Series'', vol. 173, pp. 214–241.&lt;/ref&gt; It remains in force.

The proposed 21st-century [[Kanal Istanbul]] project may be a possible bypass to the Montreux Convention and force greater Turkish autonomy with respect to the passage of military ships from the Black Sea to the [[Sea of Marmara]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.todayszaman.com/news-223806-istanbul-canal-project-to-open-debate-on-montreux-convention.html |newspaper=[[Today's Zaman]] |title=İstanbul Canal project to open debate on Montreux Convention |date=2010-10-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110430073318/http://www.todayszaman.com/news-223806-istanbul-canal-project-to-open-debate-on-montreux-convention.html |archivedate=2011-04-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/turkey-debates-whether-international-treaty-is-obstacle-to-plan-to-bypass-the-bosporus/2011/04/29/AFcaFrCF_story.html |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |title=Turkey debates whether international treaty is obstacle to plan to bypass the Bosporus |date=2011-04-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
[[File:Turkish Strait disambig.svg|thumb|300px|{{legend|#eb0000|border=solid 1px #000|2=[[Bosporus|Bosporus Strait]]}} {{legend|#ffe605|border=solid 1px #000|2=[[Dardanelles|Dardanelles Strait]]}}]]
The convention was one of a series of agreements in the 19th and 20th centuries that sought to address the long-running "[[Straits Question]]" of who should control the strategically vital link between the [[Black Sea]] and [[Mediterranean Sea]]. In 1923 the [[Treaty of Lausanne (1923)|Treaty of Lausanne]] had demilitarised the Dardanelles and opened the Straits to unrestricted civilian and military traffic, under the supervision of the [[International Straits Commission]] of the [[League of Nations]].

By the late 1930s, the strategic situation in the Mediterranean had altered with the rise of [[Kingdom of Italy (1861–1946)|Fascist Italy]], which controlled the Greek-inhabited [[Dodecanese]] islands off the west coast of Turkey and had constructed fortifications on [[Rhodes]], [[Leros]] and [[Kos]]. The Turks feared that Italy would seek to exploit access to the Straits to expand its power into [[Anatolia]] and the Black Sea region. There were also fears of Bulgarian rearmament.&lt;ref name="rozakis2"&gt;Christos L. Rozakis, Petros N. Stagos, ''The Turkish Straits'', p. 101. Martinus Nijhoff, 1987. {{ISBN|90-247-3464-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Although Turkey was not permitted to refortify the Straits, it nonetheless did so secretly.&lt;ref&gt;"Dardanelles or Çanakkale Bogazi." ''The Columbia Encyclopedia'', 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 1935, the Turkish government dispatched a lengthy diplomatic note to the signatories of the Treaty of Lausanne proposing a conference on the agreement of a new regime for the Straits and requested that the League of Nations authorise the reconstruction of the Dardanelles forts. In the note, Turkish foreign minister [[Tevfik Rüştü Aras]] explained that the international situation had changed greatly since 1923. At that time, Europe had been moving towards disarmament and an international guarantee to defend the Straits. The [[Abyssinia Crisis]] of 1934–35, the denunciation by Germany of the [[Treaty of Versailles]] and international moves towards rearmament meant that "the only guarantee intended to guard against the total insecurity of the Straits has just disappeared in its turn." Indeed, Aras said, "the Powers most closely concerned are proclaiming the existence of a threat of general conflagration."  The key weaknesses of the present regime were that the machinery for collective guarantees were too slow and ineffective, there was no contingency for a general threat of war and no provision for Turkey to defend itself. Turkey was therefore prepared

{{quote |to enter into negotiations with a view to arriving in the near future at the conclusion of agreements for regulations of the regime of the Straits under the conditions of security which are indispensable for the inviolability of Turkey's territory, in most liberal spirit, for the constant development of commercial navigation between the Mediterranean and the Black Sea.}}

The response to the note was generally favourable, and [[Australia]], [[Bulgaria]], [[France]], [[Germany]], [[Greece]], [[Japan]], [[Kingdom of Romania|Romania]], the [[Soviet Union]], [[Turkey]], the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] agreed to attend negotiations at [[Montreux]] in Switzerland, which began on 22 June 1936. Two major powers were not represented: Italy, whose aggressively expansionist policies had prompted the conference in the first place, refused to attend and the  [[United States]] declined even to send an observer.&lt;ref name="rozakis"&gt;Christos L. Rozakis, Petros N. Stagos, ''The Turkish Straits'', p. 123. Martinus Nijhoff Publishers, 1987. {{ISBN|90-247-3464-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Turkey, the UK and the Soviet Union each put forward their own set of proposals, aimed chiefly at protecting their own interests. The British favoured the continuation of a relatively restrictive approach, while the Turks sought a more liberal regime that reasserted their own control over the Straits and the Soviets proposed a regime that would guarantee absolute freedom of passage. The British, supported by France, sought to exclude the Soviet fleet from the Mediterranean Sea, where it might have threatened the vital shipping lanes to [[India]], [[Egypt]] and the [[Far East]].&lt;ref&gt;James C. F. Wang, ''Handbook on Ocean Politics and Law'', p. 88. Greenwood Publishing Group, 1992. {{ISBN|0-313-26434-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the end, the British conceded some of their requests while the Soviets succeeded in ensuring that the Black Sea countries – including the [[USSR]] – were given some exemptions from the military restrictions imposed on non-Black Sea nations. The agreement was ratified by all of the conference attendees with the exception of Germany, which had not been a signatory to the Treaty of Lausanne, and with reservations by Japan,&lt;ref&gt;"Montreux Convention (1936)." ''The Columbia Encyclopedia'', 2004&lt;/ref&gt; and came into force on 9 November 1936.&lt;ref name="rozakis" /&gt;

Britain's willingness to make concessions has been attributed to a desire to avoid Turkey being driven to ally itself with, or fall under the influence of, [[Adolf Hitler]] or [[Benito Mussolini]].&lt;ref&gt;"Montreux Convention." ''Chambers Dictionary of World History'', 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="barlas"&gt;Dilek Barlas, ''Etatism and Diplomacy in Turkey'', pp. 166–170. BRILL, 1998. {{ISBN|90-04-10855-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was thus the first in a series of steps by Britain and France to ensure that Turkey would either remain neutral or tilt towards the Western Allies in the event of any future conflict with the Axis.&lt;ref name="rozakis" /&gt;

==Terms==

The Convention consists of 29 Articles, four annexes and one protocol. Articles 2–7 consider the passage of merchant ships. Articles 8–22 consider the passage of war vessels. The key principle of freedom of passage and navigation is stated in articles 1 and 2. Article 1 provides, "The High Contracting Parties recognise and affirm the principle of freedom of passage and navigation by sea in the Straits". Article 2 states, "In time of peace, merchant vessels shall enjoy complete freedom of passage and navigation in the Straits, by day and by night, under any flag with any kind of cargo."

The International Straits Commission was abolished, authorising the full resumption of Turkish military control over the Straits and the refortification of the Dardanelles. Turkey was authorised to close the Straits to all foreign warships in wartime or when it was threatened by aggression. Also, it was authorised to refuse transit from merchant ships belonging to countries at war with Turkey.

A number of highly-specific restrictions were imposed on what type of warships are allowed passage. No more than nine foreign warships, with a total aggregate tonnage of 15,000 tons, may pass at any one time, therefore a single non-Black Sea state warship passing the straits might not exceed 15,000 tons. An aggregate tonnage of all non-Black Sea warships in the Black Sea must be no more than 30,000 tons (or 45,000 tons under special conditions), and they are permitted to stay in the Black Sea for no longer than twenty-one days.  Only Black Sea states may transit [[capital ship]]s of any tonnage, escorted by no more than two destroyers.

Under Article 12, Black Sea states are also allowed to send submarines through the Straits, with prior notice, as long as the vessels have been constructed, purchased or sent for repair outside the Black Sea. The less restrictive rules applicable to Black Sea states were agreed as, effectively, a concession to the Soviet Union, the only Black Sea state other than Turkey with any significant number of capital ships or submarines.&lt;ref name="barlas" /&gt;&lt;ref name="churchill"&gt;Robin Rolf Churchill, Alan Vaughan Lowe, ''The law of the sea'', p. 115. Manchester University Press, 1999. {{ISBN|0-7190-4382-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The passage of civil aircraft between the Mediterranean and Black Seas is permitted but only along routes authorised by the Turkish government.&lt;ref name="Goldblat"&gt;Jozef Goldblat, ''Arms control: the new guide to negotiations and agreements'', pp. 175–177.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In operation==
The terms of the Convention were largely a reflection of the international situation in the mid-1930s. They largely served Turkish and Soviet interests, enabling Turkey to regain military control of the Straits and assuring Soviet dominance of the Black Sea.&lt;ref name="Goldblat" /&gt; Although the Convention restricted the Soviets' ability to send naval forces into the Mediterranean Sea, thereby satisfying British concerns about Soviet intrusion into what was considered a British sphere of influence, it also ensured that outside powers could not exploit the Straits to threaten the Soviet Union. That was to have significant repercussions during [[World War II]] when the Montreux regime prevented the [[Axis powers]] from sending naval forces through the Straits to attack the Soviet Union.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} The Axis powers were thus severely limited in naval capability in their [[Black Sea Campaigns (1941–44)|Black Sea campaigns]], relying principally on small vessels that had been transported overland by rail and canal networks.

[[Auxiliaries|Auxiliary vessels]] and armed merchant ships occupied a grey area, however, and the transit of such vessels through the straits led to friction between the Allies and Turkey. Repeated protests from Moscow and London led to the Turkish government banning the movements of "suspicious" Axis ships with effect from June 1944 after a number of German auxiliary ships had been permitted to transit the Straits.&lt;ref&gt;Christos L. Rozakis, Petros N. Stagos, ''The Turkish Straits'', p. 125.

Cambridge University Press, 2004. {{ISBN|0-521-52329-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Aircraft carriers ===

Although the Montreux Convention is cited by the Turkish government as prohibiting aircraft carriers in the straits,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mfa.gov.tr/implementation-of-the-montreux-convention.en.mfa |title=Implementation of the Montreux Convention / Rep. of Turkey Ministry of Foreign Affairs |publisher=Mfa.gov.tr |date= |accessdate=2013-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; the treaty actually contains no explicit prohibition on aircraft carriers. However, aircraft carriers are not listed among naval ship classes, which have a right of passage under Articles 10, 11 and 12, and according to Article 10, vessels of war "other than  those which fall within the categories specified in the preceding paragraph shall only enjoy a right of transit under the special conditions  provided by Articles 11 and 12". In any case, modern aircraft carriers are heavier than the 15,000 ton limit, making it impossible for non-Black Sea powers to transit modern aircraft carriers through the Straits.

Under Article 11, Black Sea states are permitted to transit [[capital ship]]s of any tonnage through the straits, but Annex II specifically excludes aircraft carriers from the definition of capital ship.  In 1936, it was common for battleships to carry [[scout plane|observation aircraft]].  Therefore, aircraft carriers were defined as ships that were "designed or adapted primarily for the purpose of carrying and operating aircraft at sea." The inclusion of aircraft on any other ship does not classify it as an aircraft carrier.&lt;ref&gt;Wikisource. Montreux Convention (text)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Soviet Union designated its [[Kiev-class aircraft carrier|Kiev-class]] and [[Kuznetsov-class aircraft carrier|Kuznetsov-class]] aircraft carriers as "[[aircraft cruiser|aircraft carrying cruisers]]."  These ships were armed with [[P-500 Bazalt|P-500]] and [[P-700 Granit|P-700]] cruise missiles, which were also found on the [[Slava-class cruiser]] and the [[Kirov-class battlecruiser]]. The result was that that the Soviet Navy could send its aircraft carrying cruisers through the Straits in compliance with the Convention, but at the same time the Convention denied access to [[NATO]] aircraft carriers, which exceeded the 15,000 ton limit.&lt;ref&gt;14 San Diego L.

Turkey chose to accept the designation of the Soviet aircraft carrying cruisers as aircraft cruisers, as any revision of the Convention could leave Turkey with less control over the Turkish Straits, and the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea had already established more liberal passage through other straits. By allowing the Soviet aircraft carrying cruisers to transit the Straits, Turkey could leave the more restrictive Montreux Convention in place.&lt;ref name="miller1990"/&gt;

==Controversies==

The Convention remains in force, but not without dispute. It was repeatedly challenged by the Soviet Union during World War II and the [[Cold War]]. As early as 1939, [[Joseph Stalin]] sought to reopen the Straits Question and proposed joint Turkish and Soviet control of the Straits, complaining that "a small state [i.e. Turkey] supported by Great Britain held a great state by the throat and gave it no outlet".&lt;ref&gt;Deborah Welch Larson, ''Origins of Containment: A Psychological Explanation'', p. 203.

Rozakis, Petros N. Stagos, ''The Turkish Straits'', p. 44. Martinus Nijhoff Publishers, 1987. {{ISBN|90-247-3464-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Soviets returned to the issue in 1945 and 1946, demanding a revision of the Montreux Convention at a conference excluding most of the Montreux signatories, a permanent Soviet military presence and joint control of the Straits. That was firmly rejected by Turkey, despite an ongoing Soviet "strategy of tension". For several years after [[World War II]], the Soviets exploited the restriction on the number of foreign warships by ensuring that one of theirs was always in the Straits, thus effectively blocking any nation other than Turkey from sending warships through the Straits.&lt;ref&gt;"Montreux Convention (1936)." ''The Companion to British History'', Routledge. 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; Soviet pressure expanded into full demands to revise the Montreux Convention, which led to the [[Turkish Straits crisis]] of 1946, which led to Turkey abandoning its policy of neutrality. In 1947, it became the recipient of US military and economic assistance under the [[Truman Doctrine]] of [[containment]] and joined [[NATO]], along with Greece, in 1952.&lt;ref&gt;"Turkey 1." ''The Columbia Encyclopedia'', 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

The passage of US warships through the Straits also raised controversy, as the convention forbids the transit of non-Black Sea nations' warships with guns of a [[caliber|calibre]] larger than eight inches (203&amp;nbsp;mm). In the 1960s, the US sent warships carrying 420&amp;nbsp;mm calibre [[ASROC]] missiles through the Straits, prompting Soviet protests. The Turkish government rejected the Soviet complaints, pointing out that guided missiles were not guns and that since such weapons had not existed at the time of the Convention, they were not restricted.&lt;ref&gt;Bing Bing Jia, ''The Regime of Straits in International Law'', p. 112. Oxford University Press, 1998. {{ISBN|0-19-826556-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea]] (UNCLOS), which entered into force in November 1994, has prompted calls for the Montreux Convention to be revised and adapted to make it compatible with UNCLOS's regime governing straits used for international navigation. However, Turkey's longstanding refusal to sign UNCLOS has meant that Montreux remains in force without further amendments.&lt;ref&gt;"Montreux Convention". Boleslaw Adam Boczek, ''International Law: A Dictionary'', pp. 305–306. Scarecrow Press, 2005. {{ISBN|0-8108-5078-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The safety of vessels passing through the Bosporus has become a major concern in recent years as the volume of traffic has increased greatly since the Convention was signed: from 4,500 in 1934 to 49,304 by 1998. As well as obvious environmental concerns, the Straits bisect the city of Istanbul, with over 14 million people living on its shores and so [[list of maritime incidents in the Turkish Straits|maritime incidents in the Straits]] pose a considerable risk to public safety. The Convention does not, however, make any provision for the regulation of shipping for the purposes of safety and environmental protection. In January 1994, the Turkish government adopted new "Maritime Traffic Regulations for the Turkish Straits and the Marmara Region". That introduced a new regulatory regime "to ensure the safety of navigation, life and property and to protect the environment in the region" but without violating the Montreux principle of free passage. The new regulations provoked some controversy when Russia, Greece, [[Cyprus]], [[Romania]], [[Ukraine]] and Bulgaria raised objections. However, they were approved by the [[International Maritime Organization]] on the grounds that they were not intended to prejudice "the rights of any ship using the Straits under international law". The regulations were revised in November 1998 to address Russian concerns.&lt;ref&gt;Gennady Chufrin, ''The Security of the Caspian Sea Region'', pp. 155–156.

'''Moxie''' is a brand of [[carbonated beverage]] which was among the first mass-produced [[soft drink]]s in the [[United States]]. It continues to be regionally popular today. It is produced by the Moxie Beverage Company of [[Bedford, New Hampshire]]. Moxie was purchased by the Coca-Cola company in 2018.The name has become the word "[[wikt:moxie|moxie]]" in American English, meaning courage, daring, or determination.

Moxie's flavor is unique, as it is not as sweet as most modern soft drinks and is described by some as bitter. Moxie is flavored with [[gentiana|gentian root extract]], an extremely bitter substance known to possess medicinal properties. It originated around 1876 as a [[patent medicine]] called "Moxie Nerve Food".&lt;ref name="pendergrast" /&gt;

Moxie is closely associated with the state of [[Maine]] and was designated the official soft drink of Maine on May 10, 2005.&lt;ref name="maine"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.mainelegislature.org/legis/statutes/1/title1sec224.html |title= Title 1, Section 224 of General Provisions: Seal, Motto, Emblems and Flags |last1=Office of the Revisor of Statutes|first1= |last2= |

On August 28, 2018 [[The Coca-Cola Company]] agreed to buy Moxie.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/food/2018/08/28/coca-cola-acquires-moxie-soda-brand-beloved-maine/1123348002/ ''Coca-Cola acquires Moxie, a soda brand that is beloved in Maine'', USA Today, August 28, 2018] Retrieved August 30, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Moxie originated as a patent medicine called "Moxie Nerve Food",&lt;ref name="pendergrast" /&gt; which was created around 1876 by Dr. Augustin Thompson in Lowell, Massachusetts.&lt;ref name="lowell"/&gt; Thompson claimed that it contained an extract from a rare, unnamed [[South America]]n plant, which is now known to be [[gentiana|gentian root]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.drinkmoxie.com/history.php |title=Moxie. Distinctively Different |publisher=Drinkmoxie.com |date= |accessdate=2018-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moxie, he claimed, was especially effective against "[[paralysis]], [[softening of the brain]], [[Anxiety (mood)|nervousness]], and [[insomnia]]".&lt;ref name="pendergrast" /&gt;

Thompson claimed that he named the beverage after a [[Lieutenant]] Moxie,&lt;ref name="pendergrast"&gt;[[Mark Pendergrast]]: For God, Country and Coca-Cola, Charles Scribner's Sons, New York, 1993, {{ISBN|978-0-465-05468-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; a purported friend of his, who he claimed had discovered the plant and used it as a [[panacea (medicine)|panacea]], and the company he created continued to promulgate legendary stories about the word's origin.  It likely derives from an [[Abenaki language|Abenaki]] word that means "dark water" and that is found in lake and river names in Maine, where Thompson was born and raised.&lt;ref&gt;"moxie (n.)". Online Etymology Dictionary. 2014. Douglas Harper. 3 September 2014, http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=moxie.&lt;/ref&gt;

After a few years, Thompson added [[soda water]] to the formula and changed the product's name to "Beverage Moxie Nerve Food". By 1884 he was selling Moxie both in bottles and in bulk as a [[soda fountain]] syrup. In 1885, he received a trade mark for the term. He marketed it as "a delicious blend of bitter and sweet, a drink to satisfy everyone's taste".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

[[File:1914 - Allentown Independence Day Outing.jpg|thumb|left|275px|A group of friends from [[Allentown, Pennsylvania]], celebrating the 4th of July holiday in 1913 with a case of Moxie at a grove.]]

A lawsuit was filed in 1907 by the Moxie Nerve Food Company of New England against the Modox Company and others, alleging that they had copied the ingredients of Moxie and were using the name "Modox",&lt;ref name="Modox"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.drinkmodox.com/ |title= Commercial Site: Modox |author= |date= |publisher=|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; which closely resembled "Moxie", and were infringing upon patents and trademarks.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=ZbkKAAAAYAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover "Moxie Nerve Food Company of New England v. Modox Co. et al. : Circuit Court, District of Rhode Island, February 20, 1907"], ''The Federal Reporter'', v.151-152, 1907, pp.493-509.&lt;/ref&gt; The suit was dismissed by the judge, who said the court could not protect the legitimate part of the plaintiff's business in this case. In a later case in [[New York (state)|New York]], the Moxie Nerve Food Company won a lawsuit against Modox, which subsequently went out of business.&lt;ref name="Modox"/&gt;

President [[Calvin Coolidge]] was known to favor the drink, and [[Boston Red Sox]] slugger [[Ted Williams]] endorsed it on radio and in print. The company also marketed a beverage called "Ted's Root Beer" in the early sixties. Author [[E. B. White]] once claimed that "Moxie contains [[Gentiana lutea|gentian root]], which is the path to the good life."&lt;ref name="Moxie1"&gt;{{Citation | date=November 2001 | title=Make Mine Moxie | periodical=Perspective | publication-place=Cambridge, Massachusetts | place=Harvard-Radcliffe | publisher= | url=http://www.digitas.harvard.edu/~perspy/old/issues/2001/nov/backpage.html | accessdate=October 9, 2007 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://archive.is/20041115055845/http://www.digitas.harvard.edu/~perspy/old/issues/2001/nov/backpage.html | archivedate=November 15, 2004 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, one of the ingredients of Moxie is "Gentian Root Extractives", which may contribute to the drink's unique flavor.&lt;ref name="Moxie4"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bdragon.com/moxie/moxie.shtml |title="Moxie For Mine: More About Moxie the Drink" |publisher=Bdragon.com |date= |accessdate=2018-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The brand suffered a significant decline in sales during the 1930s.

The [[Catawissa Bottling Company]] in [[Catawissa, Pennsylvania]], is one of six bottlers in the United States that produce Moxie. Catawissa has produced it since 1945.&lt;ref name="MoxieGlobe1"&gt;{{Citation

===Since 1962===
Sugar-free Diet Moxie was introduced in 1962, about the same time that ''[[Mad Magazine|Mad]]'' magazine began placing the Moxie logo in the background of its articles to increase public awareness of it. As a result of ''Mad''&amp;nbsp;’s efforts, sales of the soft drink increased 10%;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.drinkmoxie.com/history.php|title=History of Moxie: 1960 - 1969|last=|first=|date=n.d.|website=Moxie Beverage Company.|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; this led to the "Mad About Moxie" campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Dun's Review|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KL8SAQAAMAAJ|date=January 1968|publisher=Dun and Bradstreet|page=56}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Moxie brand  was purchased in 1966 by the [[Monarch Beverage Company]] of [[Atlanta]]. In 2007 Monarch sold it to its current owner, [[Cornucopia Beverages]] of [[Bedford, New Hampshire]], which is owned by the [[Coca-Cola Bottling Company of Northern New England]], a subsidiary of the [[Kirin Brewery Company]], which is a subsidiary of Kirin Company, Limited, which is a subsidiary of [[Kirin Holdings Company, Limited]], based in [[Tokyo]], [[Japan]] (a member of the [[Mitsubishi]] ''[[keiretsu]]'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

In its decision to step up efforts to distribute the product, Cornucopia cited increasing requests for Moxie from fans across the country. In 2007 it launched pilot sales in [[Florida]] and in 2010 granted distribution in Florida to Florida Micro Beverage Distributors.&lt;ref name="AP01"&gt;[http://www.boston.com/news/local/new_hampshire/articles/2010/12/08/florida_is_getting_some_moxie/ "Florida is getting some Moxie"], [[Associated Press|AP]] via ''boston.com'', December 8, 2010.

[[Image:A classic-styled modern label from a bottle of Moxie brand cream soda.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The original Moxie logo featuring the "Moxie Man" on the label of a derivative product.]]

In 2011, Cornucopia began [[doing business as]] the Moxie Beverage Company to market Moxie and Moxie-branded products. A website, [http://www.drinkmoxie.com DrinkMoxie.com], was created to promote Moxie. Drink recipes using Moxie  were created.

Demand for Moxie has waned in recent years, although the brand persists in [[New England]] and [[Pennsylvania]].

On August 28, 2018 Coca-Cola Co. announced it was buying Moxie from Coca-Cola Bottling Company of Northern New England Inc. for an unspecified amount.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-08-28/coke-inks-deal-to-buy-moxie-the-official-soft-drink-of-maine Coke Inks Deal to Buy Moxie, the Official Soft Drink of Maine] &lt;i&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/i&gt;, August 28, 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

==Advertising==
Through extensive advertising, the term "moxie" has become a widely known term in [[American English]] with the meaning "courage, daring, or spirit",&lt;ref name="chambers"&gt;The Chambers Dictionary, 1993, {{ISBN|0-550-10255-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="merriam-webster.com"&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/moxie] Defined in the Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary.&lt;/ref&gt; as in "This guy's got moxie!"

In its advertising, Moxie used "Make Mine Moxie!" [[jingle|advertising jingles]], the slogan "Just Make It Moxie for Mine", and a "Moxie Man" logo. The Moxie Man had appeared on Moxie labels since the beverage was first sold. But in 2010 the Moxie Man logo was removed from labels because it was thought to be too old-fashioned. In 2011 the company's head of marketing, Ryan Savage, made the executive decision to bring the logo back in response to complaints from long-standing customers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://sites.google.com/site/historyofmoxie/ |title=The Removal of The Moxie Man and his Return |work=History of Moxie |accessdate=April 16, 2015}} {{Better source|reason=Just some random person's blog, I guess.|date=April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A unique advertising tool was the Moxie Horsemobile, a modified automobile whose driver sat on a large model of a horse. The first Horsemobiles were deployed around 1918.  A 1935 [[Rolls-Royce]] Moxie Horsemobile was sold for $55,000 at the May 20, 2011, Mecum Auction in [[Indianapolis]], [[Indiana]].  Moxie at one time maintained about two dozen of them, and they appeared in parades and other public functions.

==Derivative products==
There is also a ''Moxie Energy Drink'' and a variety of ''"Olde New England Seltzers."'' The energy drink is citrus-based; it lacks Moxie's gentian root tang, caramel color, and (as of 2008) its distinctive branding; similarly, the waters are simply carbonated waters with fruit flavors marketed under the Moxie brand.

Moxie ice cream is seasonally available in Maine in limited quantities&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wagner |first=Debra |title=Moxie Ice Cream "You 'Betcha' It's Wicked Good" |url=http://www.lisbonreporter.com/2010/07/moxie-ice-cream-you-betcha-its-wicked.html |work=The Lisbon Reporter|accessdate=2013-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is mild in flavor as compared to the soft drink.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5476">Under [[Income tax in the United States|U.S. Federal income tax law]], a '''net operating loss (NOL)''' occurs when certain tax-deductible [[Expense|expenses]] exceed taxable [[Revenue|revenues]] for a [[Fiscal year|taxable year]].&lt;ref&gt;Kieso, Weygandt J. and Terry D. Warfield. Fundamentals of Intermediate Accounting, John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2006. p.699 {{ISBN|0-471-75272-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;  If a taxpayer is taxed during profitable periods without receiving any [[tax relief]] (e.g. a refund) during periods of NOLs, an unbalanced tax burden results.&lt;ref&gt;Donaldson, Samual A. Federal Income Taxation of Individuals: Cases, Problems and Materials, ThomsonWest, 2 ed. 2007. p.301 {{ISBN|978-0-314-17597-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, in some situations, [[United States Congress|Congress]] allows taxpayers to use the losses in one year to offset the profits of other years. 

==Calculating the NOL amount==

The NOL amount is the amount of the loss from the current year that can be carried back to prior tax years or carried forward to future years.  

===Individuals===
The NOL amount is the business loss incurred by a taxpayer.  The following items are excluded when calculating the NOL amount:
* any deduction for personal exemptions
* net capital loss (capital losses in excess of capital gains); net capital gains are included
* nonbusiness deductions in excess of nonbusiness income; net nonbusiness income is included

In addition, the NOL amount excludes other adjustments such as:
* section 1202 exclusion of the gain from the sale or exchange of qualified small business stock
* net operating loss deduction from other tax years
* domestic production activities deduction &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Publication 536, Net Operating Losses (NOLs) for Individuals, Estates, and Trusts|url=https://www.irs.gov/publications/p536/ar02.html#en_US_2015_publink1000177352|website=IRS.gov|publisher=Internal Revenue Service|accessdate=13 October 2016|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Corporations===
For corporations, an NOL is the excess of the deductions allowed over gross income with the following adjustments.
* no NOL deduction
* no section 199 domestic production activities deduction
* the dividends-received deductions for dividends received are computed without regard to section 246(b) limit
* the dividends-paid deduction is computed without regard to the limitation under section 247(a)(1)(B). &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Instructions for Form 1139|url=https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/i1139.pdf|website=www.irs.gov|publisher=Internal Revenue Service|accessdate=13 October 2016|pages=2|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Loss carry back and carry forward mechanisms==

Generally the NOL must be carried back to the two tax years before the NOL year.  For example, the tax loss from 2015 must be carried back to 2013 or 2014.  Any remaining amount can be carried forward for up to 20 years.   The taxpayer can elect to waive the carry back and therefore carry all of the loss to future years.  Once the 20-year carry forward period expires, the taxpayer cannot deduct any part of the remaining NOL.

The carry back period for certain NOLs is greater than 2 years:&lt;br /&gt;

:'''3 year carry back period'''&lt;br /&gt;
::*losses from casualty or theft
::*farm or small business losses related to a federally declared disaster
::* qualified small business losses

:'''5 year carry back period'''&lt;br /&gt;
::* farm losses
::* qualifying disaster losses (corporations only)

:'''10 year carry back period'''&lt;br /&gt;
::* losses related to product liability claims
::* decommissioning of a nuclear power plant - (corporations only)
::* losses related to reclamation of land and dismantling of drilling platforms
::* losses related to environmental contamination and workers compensation act payments &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Publication 536|url=https://www.irs.gov/publications/p536/ar02.html#en_US_2015_publink1000177352|website=IRS.gov|publisher=Internal Revenue Service|accessdate=13 October 2016|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;
::* Qualified Gulf Opportunity Zone (GO Zone) losses - (corporations only)

If the corporation has a corporate equity reduction transaction, a different carry forward period may apply.
 
Section 1211 of the [[American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009]] increased the carry back period for small businesses.  For net operating losses incurred in 2008, the carry back period was increased to 5 years. &lt;ref&gt;See generally {{usc|26|172}}.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Business Provisions of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA)|url=https://www.irs.gov/uac/business-provisions-of-the-american-recovery-and-reinvestment-act-of-2009-arra|website=www.IRS.gov|publisher=Internal Revenue Service|accessdate=13 October 2016|language=English|date=May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Financial statement reporting==
Under [[US GAAP]], the amount of net operating losses available for future years is reported in the notes to the financial statements.  For example, [[Kinross Gold]] reported $US 893 million of NOL carry forwards were available as at December 31, 2014 related to its subsidiaries in [[Barbados]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2014 Kinross Gold Annual Report|url=http://2014annualreport.kinross.com/pdf/annual-report-2014.pdf|publisher=Kinross Gold|accessdate=13 October 2016|pages=FS 52|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1783">'''Nikolai Mikhailovich Korkunov''' (Николай Михайлович Коркунов; April 1853 – 1904) was a leading authority on [[constitutional law]] and [[legal sociology]] in the [[Russian Empire]].

His father was [[Mikhail Korkunov]], a noted Russian historian. His sister [[Marie de Manacéïne]] was known for her pioneering studies of sleep and dreams. After [[Aleksandr Gradovsky]]'s death in 1889 Korkunov held the chair in constitutional and [[international law]] at the [[University of Saint Petersburg]].

Korkunov was also active in the [[Commission for the Laws of Finland]]. He argued that [[Grand Duchy of Finland]]'s claim to sovereignty was groundless.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander J. Motyl. ''The Post-Soviet Nations: Perspectives on the Demise of the USSR''. 2nd ed. Columbia University Press, 1995. Page 97.&lt;/ref&gt; He defined [[autocracy]] as the "sovereignty of the ruler, the unlimited character of his rule, but at the same time the need to limit this rule by legal principles, basic laws of his own making".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted from: ''Stalinism: Essays in Historical Interpretation'' (ed. Robert C. Tucker). Transaction Publishers, 1977. Page 134.&lt;/ref&gt;

An English translation of Korkunov's ''General Theory of Law'' appeared in Boston in 1909. It was reprinted by Beard Books in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books?id=mfm8ITpCPZYC&amp;printsec=frontcover&lt;/ref&gt; Some of his basic ideas were later elaborated by [[Leon Petrazycki]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21278">The '''nothing to hide argument''' states that government [[surveillance]] programs do not threaten [[privacy]] unless they uncover illegal activities, and that if they do uncover illegal activities, the person committing these activities does not have the right to keep them private. Hence, a person who favors this argument may state "I've got nothing to hide" and therefore does not express opposition to government surveillance.&lt;ref&gt;Mordini, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=rncAXAFD1jcC&amp;pg=PA252&amp;dq=privacy+%22nothing+to+hide%22+argument&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=3ynJUa6xGJLy9gSVmoDYAw&amp;ved=0CDkQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=privacy%20%22nothing%20to%20hide%22%20argument&amp;f=false 252].&lt;/ref&gt; An individual using this argument may say that a person should not worry about government or surveillance if he/she has "nothing to hide."&lt;ref&gt;[[Daniel J. Solove|Solove]], ''Nothing to Hide: The False Tradeoff Between Privacy and Security'', p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=aaJdKX8avUAC&amp;dq=privacy+%22nothing+to+hide%22+argument&amp;q=%22you+shouldn%27t+worry+about+government+surveillance%22#v=snippet&amp;q=%22you%20shouldn%27t%20worry%20about%20government%20surveillance%22&amp;f=false 1]. "If you've got nothing to hide, you shouldn't worry about government surveillance."&lt;/ref&gt;

The motto "If you've got nothing to hide, you've got nothing to fear" has been used in the [[closed-circuit television]] program practiced in the [[United Kingdom]].&lt;ref name="SoloveChronHighWhyPriv" /&gt;

==Prevalence==
This argument is commonly used in discussions regarding [[privacy]]. [[Geoffrey Stone]], a legal scholar, said that the use of the argument is "all-too-common".&lt;ref name=SoloveChronHighWhyPriv&gt;[[Daniel J. Solove|Solove, Daniel J]]. "[https://chronicle.com/article/Why-Privacy-Matters-Even-if/127461/ Why Privacy Matters Even if You Have 'Nothing to Hide']." ''[[The Chronicle of Higher Education]]''. May 15, 2011. Retrieved on June 25, 2013. "The nothing-to-hide argument pervades discussions about privacy. The [[data security]] expert Bruce Schneier calls it the "most common retort against privacy advocates." The legal scholar Geoffrey Stone refers to it as an "all-too-common refrain." In its most compelling form, it is an argument that the privacy interest is generally minimal, thus making the contest with security concerns a foreordained victory for security."&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bruce Schneier]], a data security expert and [[Cryptography|cryptographer]], described it as the "most common retort against privacy advocates."&lt;ref name=SoloveChronHighWhyPriv/&gt; Colin J. Bennett, author of ''The Privacy Advocates'', said that an advocate of privacy often "has to constantly refute" the argument.&lt;ref&gt;Bennett, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=aKEPrhAtk7wC&amp;pg=PR16&amp;dq=%22nothing+to+hide%22+privacy&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=8LXLUdrFNoeK9QSgp4GYBQ&amp;ved=0CFsQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&amp;q=%22nothing%20to%20hide%22&amp;f=false 97].&lt;/ref&gt; Bennett explained that most people "go through their daily lives believing that surveillance processes are not directed at them, but at the miscreants and wrongdoers" and that "the dominant orientation is that mechanisms of surveillance are directed at others" despite "evidence that the monitoring of individual behavior has become routine and everyday".&lt;ref&gt;Bennett, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=aKEPrhAtk7wC&amp;pg=PR16&amp;dq=%22nothing+to+hide%22+privacy&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=8LXLUdrFNoeK9QSgp4GYBQ&amp;ved=0CFsQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&amp;q=%22nothing%20to%20hide%22&amp;f=false 97]-[https://books.google.com/books?id=aKEPrhAtk7wC&amp;pg=PA98&amp;dq=%22the+dominant+orientation+is+that+mechanisms%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=CPXLUa2-CJD49gTt24GAAg&amp;ved=0CC4Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22the%20dominant%20orientation%20is%20that%20mechanisms%22&amp;f=false 98].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ethnography==
An ethnographic study by Ana Viseu, Andrew Clement, and Jane Aspinal of the integration of online services into everyday life was published as "Situating Privacy Online: Complex Perceptions and Everyday Practices" in the ''[[Information, Communication &amp; Society]]'' journal in 2004. It found that, in the words of Kirsty Best, author of "Living in the control society: Surveillance, users and digital screen technologies", "fully employed, middle to middle-upper income earners articulated similar beliefs about not being targeted for surveillance" compared to other respondents who did not show concern, and that "In these cases, respondents expressed the view that they were not doing anything wrong, or that they had nothing to hide."&lt;ref name=Bestp12&gt;Best, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; Of the participant sample in Viseu's study, one reported using privacy-enhancing technology,&lt;ref&gt;Viseu, et al. p. 102-103.&lt;/ref&gt; and Viseu et al. said "One of the clearest features of our subjects’ privacy perceptions and practices was their passivity towards the issue."&lt;ref&gt;Viseu, et al. p. 102.&lt;/ref&gt; Viseu et al. said the passivity originated from the "nothing to hide" argument.&lt;ref name=Viseup103&gt;Viseu, et al. p. 103.&lt;/ref&gt;

During a qualitative study conducted for the [[government of the United Kingdom]] around 2003,&lt;ref name="OECDp323"&gt;OECD, "Appendix II: Can We Be Persuaded to Become Pet-Lovers?&lt;!--(PET means "privacy-enhancing technologies)--&gt;" p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=GlXGYFJ6ANgC&amp;pg=PA324&amp;dq=%22In+a+recent+qualitative+study+conducted+for+the+UK+government%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=qx7OUaOZF4rm8wTSooDADQ&amp;ved=0CCwQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22In%20a%20recent%20qualitative%20study%20conducted%20for%20the%20UK%20government%22&amp;f=false 323].&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. Perri 6{{sic}}&lt;ref&gt;OECD, "Appendix II: Can We Be Persuaded to Become Pet-Lovers?&lt;!--(PET means "privacy-enhancing technologies)--&gt;" p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=GlXGYFJ6ANgC&amp;pg=PA305&amp;dq=%22This+study+was+prepared+by+Dr.+Perri%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=sCDOUcmoIZLM9gTkkYDIBA&amp;ved=0CDQQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22This%20study%20was%20prepared%20by%20Dr.%20Perri%22&amp;f=false 305]&lt;/ref&gt; presented four outlooks on privacy risks with a mapping of eight frames to show privacy attitude distributions.&lt;ref name=OECDp323/&gt; According to the study, men who were self-employed initially used the "nothing to hide" argument before shifting to an argument in which they perceived surveillance to be a nuisance instead of a threat.&lt;ref&gt;OECD, "Appendix II: Can We Be Persuaded to Become Pet-Lovers?&lt;!--(PET means "privacy-enhancing technologies)--&gt;"  p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=GlXGYFJ6ANgC&amp;pg=PA326&amp;dq=%22nothing+to+hide%22+privacy&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=3BXOUdPPIoLY9QS03oA4&amp;ved=0CEcQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22brokers%20in%20networks%22&amp;f=false 326]. "The self-employed males, by contrast, who operated as brokers in networks; might sometimes begin with the "nothing to hide" frame, in which they would claim that no one with anything to hide need be concerned about privacy at all, but quickly shifted to the "inconvenience" frame, in which data collection and sharing was seen more as a nuisance than as a threat."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effect on privacy protection==
Viseu, et al. said that the argument "has been well documented in the privacy literature as a stumbling block to the development of pragmatic [[privacy protection]] strategies, and it, too, is related to the ambiguous and symbolic nature of the term ‘privacy’ itself."&lt;ref name=Viseup103/&gt; They explained that privacy is an abstract concept and people only become concerned with it once their privacy is gone, and they compare a loss to privacy with people knowing that [[ozone depletion]] and [[global warming]] are negative developments but that "the immediate gains of driving the car to work or putting on hairspray outweigh the often invisible losses of [[pollution|polluting]] the environment."&lt;ref name=Viseup103/&gt;

==Arguments for and against==
{{expand section|date=June 2013}}

===For privacy===
[[Edward Snowden]]: "Arguing that you don't care about the right to privacy because you have nothing to hide is no different than saying you don't care about [[free speech]] because you have nothing to say." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/36ru89/just_days_left_to_kill_mass_surveillance_under/|title=Just days left to kill mass surveillance under Section 215 of the Patriot Act. We are Edward Snowden and the ACLU’s Jameel Jaffer. AUA. • /r/IAmA|website=reddit|access-date=2016-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"When you say, ‘I have nothing to hide,’ you’re saying, ‘I don’t care about this right.’ You’re saying, ‘I don’t have this right, because I’ve got to the point where I have to justify it.’ The way rights work is, the government has to justify its intrusion into your rights."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2014/10/11/edward-snowden-new-yorker-festival/|title=Edward Snowden’s Privacy Tips: "Get Rid Of Dropbox," Avoid Facebook And Google|website=TechCrunch|access-date=2017-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Daniel J. Solove]] stated in an article for ''[[The Chronicle of Higher Education]]'' that he opposes the argument; he stated that a government can leak information about a person and cause damage to that person, or use information about a person to deny access to services even if a person did not actually engage in wrongdoing, and that a government can cause damage to one's personal life through making errors.&lt;ref name=SoloveChronHighWhyPriv/&gt; Solove wrote "When engaged directly, the nothing-to-hide argument can ensnare, for it forces the debate to focus on its narrow understanding of privacy. But when confronted with the plurality of privacy problems implicated by government [[data collection]] and use beyond surveillance and disclosure, the nothing-to-hide argument, in the end, has nothing to say."&lt;ref name=SoloveChronHighWhyPriv/&gt;

[[Danah Boyd]], a social media researcher, opposes the argument. She said that even though "[p]eople often feel immune from state surveillance because they’ve done nothing wrong" an entity or group can distort a person's image and harm one's reputation, or [[guilt by association]] can be used to defame a person.&lt;ref&gt;[[danah boyd|boyd, danah]]&lt;!--Intentionally uncapitalized--&gt;. "[http://www.dallasnews.com/opinion/sunday-commentary/20130614-danah-boyd-the-problem-with-the-i-have-nothing-to-hide-argument.ece Danah Boyd&lt;!--I's capitalized in the DMN article--&gt;: The problem with the ‘I have nothing to hide’ argument]." (Opinion) ''[[The Dallas Morning News]]''. June 14, 2013. Retrieved on June 25, 2013. "It’s disturbing to me how often I watch as someone’s likeness is constructed in ways[...]"&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Adam D. Moore]], author of ''Privacy Rights: Moral and Legal Foundations'', argued "it is the view that rights are resistant to cost/benefit or consequentialist sort of arguments. Here we are rejecting the view that privacy interests are the sorts of things that can be traded for security."&lt;ref name=Moorep204&gt;Moore, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=AEn0J0Drx9MC&amp;pg=PA204&amp;dq=%22tHE+DISTribution+aspect+is+highlighted+when+surveillance+targets%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=NvLLUcSJEIj68QTF04HIBw&amp;ved=0CDQQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22tHE%20DISTribution%20aspect%20is%20highlighted%20when%20surveillance%20targets%22&amp;f=false 204].&lt;/ref&gt; He also stated that surveillance can disproportionately affect certain groups in society based on appearance, ethnicity, and religion.&lt;ref name=Moorep204/&gt;  Moore maintains that there are at least three other problems with the "nothing to hide" argument.  First, if individuals have [[privacy rights]], then invoking "nothing to hide" is irrelevant.  Privacy, understood as a right to control access to and uses of spaces, locations, and personal information, means that it is the right holder who determines access.  To drive this point home Moore offers the following case.  "Imagine upon exiting your house one day you find a person searching through your trash painstakingly putting the shredded notes and documents back together.  In response to your stunned silence he proclaims 'you don’t have anything to worry about – there is no reason to hide, is there?'" &lt;ref name="Moorep204"/&gt; Second, individuals may wish to hide embarrassing behavior or conduct not accepted by the dominant culture.  "Consider someone’s sexual or [[medical history]]. Imagine someone visiting a library to learn about alternative lifestyles not accepted by the majority." &lt;ref name="Moorep204"/&gt; Finally, Moore argues that "nothing to hide," if taken seriously, could be used against government agents, politicians, and CEO's.  This is to turn the “nothing to hide” argument on its head.  Moore argues that the [[NSA]] agent, politician, police chief, and CEO have nothing to hide so they should embrace total transparency like the rest of us.  "But they don’t and when given the technological tools to watch, the politician, police chief, or CEO are almost always convinced that watching others is a good thing." &lt;ref name="Moorep204"/&gt;

[[Bruce Schneier]], a computer security expert and cryptographer, expressed opposition, citing [[Cardinal Richelieu]]'s statement "If one would give me six lines written by the hand of the most honest man, I would find something in them to have him hanged", referring to how a state government can find aspects in a person's life in order to prosecute or [[blackmail]] that individual.&lt;ref name="SchneierEternal"&gt;[[Bruce Schneier|Schneier, Bruce]]. "[https://www.schneier.com/essay-114.html The Eternal Value of Privacy]." ''[https://www.schneier.com/ Schneier on Security].'' May 18, 2006. Retrieved on May 13, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; Schneier also argued "Too many wrongly characterize the debate as 'security versus privacy.' The real choice is liberty versus control."&lt;ref name=SchneierEternal/&gt;

[[Emilio Mordini]], philosopher and psychoanalyst, argued that the "nothing to hide" argument is inherently paradoxical. People do not need to have "something to hide" in order to hide "something".  What is relevant is not what is hidden, rather  the experience that there is an intimate area, which could be hidden, whose access could be restricted. Psychologically speaking, we become individuals through the discovery that we could hide something to others.&lt;ref&gt;Mordini "Nothing to Hide — Biometrics, Privacy and Private Sphere." p.257-60&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Julian Assange]] states: "There is no killer answer yet. [[Jacob Appelbaum]] (@ioerror) has a clever response, asking people who say this to then hand him their phone unlocked and pull down their pants. My version of that is to say, 'well, if you're so boring then we shouldn't be talking to you, and neither should anyone else', but philosophically, the real answer is this: Mass surveillance is a mass structural change. When society goes bad, it's going to take you with it, even if you are the blandest person on earth."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wikileaksetc.blogspot.nl/2015/04/courage-foundation-reddit-ama.html|title=Courage Foundation: Reddit AMA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Harvey A.

[[Eric Schmidt]], the CEO of [[Google]] at the time, said "If you have something that you don't want anyone to know, maybe you shouldn't be doing it in the first place, but if you really need that kind of privacy, the reality is that search engines including Google do retain this information for some time, and it's important, for example that we are all subject in the United States to the [[Patriot Act]]. It is possible that that information could be made available to the authorities."

When discussing the [[MAINWAY]] program, former [[U.S. Senate]] majority leader [[Trent Lott]] stated "What are people worried about? What is the problem? Are you doing something you're not supposed to?" &lt;ref name = "Trent"&gt;{{cite news

[[Johann Hari]], a British writer, argued that the "nothing to hide" argument is irrelevant to the placement of CCTV cameras in public places in the United Kingdom because the cameras are public areas where one is observed by many people he or she would be unfamiliar with and not in "places where you hide".&lt;ref&gt;[[Johann Hari|Hari, Johann]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4557">The '''Official Information Act 2008''' is a [[Cook Islands]] law passed to "make official information more freely available, [and] to establish procedures for the achievement of those purposes."&lt;ref&gt;Official Information Act 2008, long title.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Act also repealed the [[Official Secrets Act 1951]], which the Cook Islands had inherited from [[New Zealand]]. 

The law was introduced into the [[Parliament of the Cook Islands|Cook Islands Parliament]] on 12 February 2008,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rnzi.com/pages/news.php?op=read&amp;id=37977 |title=Cook Islands Government introduces freedom of information legislation |publisher=Radio New Zealand International |date=2008-02-12 |accessdate=2009-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; and passed two days later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Freedom of Information Act Passed |url=http://www.cook-islands.gov.ck/view_release.php?release_id=1185 |date=2008-02-15 |publisher=Cook Islands Government |accessdate=2009-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It came into force on 11 February 2009.&lt;ref&gt;Official Information Act 2008, section 1(2).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Summary of the Act==

The law is heavily based on the New Zealand [[Official Information Act 1982]].  As in New Zealand, the definition of "official information" is extremely broad, covering any information held by a Ministry, a Minister in their official capacity, or a scheduled organisation.&lt;ref&gt;Official Information Act 2008, section 2(1).&lt;/ref&gt;  Information held by the courts, tribunals, commissions of inquiry, or investigative material held by the Ombudsman's office is excluded.  Unlike New Zealand, the law applies to "any companies in which 50% or more of the shares are owned by the Crown,"&lt;ref&gt;Official Information Act 2008, schedule one.&lt;/ref&gt; allowing the operations of crown-owned assets to be effectively monitored.

The scheme for deciding whether information is released or withheld also follows that of New Zealand.  Decisions are governed by an overarching "principle of availability": "that... information shall be made available unless there is good reason for withholding it".&lt;ref&gt;Official Information Act 2008, section 5.&lt;/ref&gt;  "Good reason" is narrowly defined in the Act.  Conclusive reasons for withholding information include national security or international relations, that it was supplied by another government in confidence, maintenance of the law, personal safety, or severe economic damage.&lt;ref&gt;Official Information Act 2008, section 6.&lt;/ref&gt; Other reasons, which must be weighed against the public interest in release, include:&lt;ref&gt;Official Information Act 2008, section 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

* protecting personal privacy;
* protecting trade secrets;
* protecting information given in confidence;
* protecting public health and safety;
* protecting New Zealand's economic interests, or members of the public from material loss;
* protecting the confidentiality of ministerial discussions and advice;
* protecting the "free and frank advice" of officials, and Ministers from harassment;
* legal or professional privilege;
* commercial confidentiality;
* allowing the government to conduct negotiations; or
* preventing the use of official information for "improper gain or improper advantage";

Requests can also be refused if release of the information would contravene the law or constitute contempt of court, or for administrative reasons (because the information will soon be made publicly available, that substantial research is required, or simply because it is vexatious).&lt;ref&gt;Official Information Act 2008, section 18.&lt;/ref&gt;  Organisations can charge for large requests.

Requests may be made by Cook Islands citizens or permanent residents, or people or corporations who have been resident or doing business in the Cook Islands for the past three years.&lt;ref&gt;Official Information Act 2008, sections 11; 2(1).&lt;/ref&gt; Government organisations have 20 working days to respond, and if a request is refused in whole or in part, they must give reasons for the refusal.&lt;ref&gt;Official Information Act 2008, section 14.&lt;/ref&gt;  Decisions may be appealed to the [[Cook Islands Ombudsman|Ombudsman]].

The law also created a right to access and correct personal information held on a person by the government.&lt;ref&gt;Official Information Act 2008, part 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13371">'''Pacification theory''' is a counter-hegemonic approach to the study of [[police]] and [[security]] which views the contemporary security-industrial complex as both an organizing and systematic war strategy targeting [[Sovereign state|domestic]] and [[foreign policy|foreign]] enemies while simultaneously acting as a process that actively fabricates a [[social order]] conducive to [[capitalist accumulation]]. According to its academic proponents, such an approach to police and security reveals inherent [[Class conflict|class war]] dimensions that have been reinforced by police intellectuals since at least the eighteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;Ozcan, Gulden and George S. Rigakos. 2014. [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/9780470670590.wbeog621/full "Pacification"] The Wiley Blackwell Encyclopedia of Globalization&lt;/ref&gt;

At base, pacification reflects the need to fabricate productive territories and subjects conducive to [[Exploitation of labour|exploitation]].&lt;ref&gt;George S. Rigakos, John L. McMullan, Joshua Johnson &amp; Gülden Ozcan, Eds. 2009. [http://www.redquillbooks.com/portfolio-posts/general-police-system-political-economy-security-age-enlightenment/ A General Police System: Political Economy and Security in the Age of Enlightenment].

Socialist Studies / Études socialistes 9 (2) Winter 2013:2&lt;/ref&gt; explain: "The extraction of surplus, as [[Adam Smith]]&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Adam. 1981. An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the [http://www.gutenberg.org/files/3300/3300-h/3300-h.htm Wealth of Nations]. Indianapolis: Liberty Fund.,p.387&lt;/ref&gt; admits, can ‘be squeezed out of [the labourer] by [[violence]] only, and not by any interest of his own’ if he can [[subsist]] otherwise such as through access to [[communal land]]. This, in short, is the foundational [[bourgeois]] logic for the compulsion to pacify."

==Central tenets==
Pacification theory may vary in its use depending on the analyst, but most scholars associated with Anti-security&lt;ref&gt;Manolov, Martin V. and George S. Rigakos. 2014. "[https://www.academia.edu/8020906/Anti-security Anti-security]". The Wiley-Blackwell Encyclopedia of Globalization&lt;/ref&gt; would likely agree that its central tenets encompass:&lt;ref name="redquillbooks1"&gt;Rigakos, George. ""To Extend the Scope of Productive Labour:" Pacification as a Police Project." [http://www.redquillbooks.com/portfolio-posts/anti-security/ Anti-Security]. Eds. Rigakos, George and Mark Neocleous. Ottawa: Red Quill Books, 2011. 57-83.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
# problematizing the objectives of [[security]];  
# building analytic connections instead of masking them;  
# displacing the ubiquity and reach of security; and   
# anticipating a state of war (including [[Class conflict|class war]]) viewing security as an active, unfinished project rife with resistance.
Associated with this last point and serving an essential component of pacification is its immediate connection to making subjects economically "[[Productive and unproductive labour|productive]]" both historically within the plans of [[military]] and [[colonialism|colonial]] overseers and by contemporary police actions, both domestic and international. Neocleous has characterized this process as making war through peace:&lt;ref&gt;Neocleous, Mark. 2010. “[https://www.academia.edu/7593571/War_as_Peace_Peace_as_Pacification War as Peace, Peace as Pacification].” Radical Philosophy 159, pp. 8-17.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
{{Quote box
 | quote  = " we need to grasp security ''as'' pacification... whereas for most people ‘pacification’ is associated with the actions of colonizing powers, has a close connection to counter-insurgency tactics and is therefore widely understood as the military crushing of resistance, an examination of the theory and practice of pacification reveals a far more ‘productive’ dimension to the idea. ‘Productive’ in that what is involved is less the military crushing of resistance and more the fabrication of order, of which the crushing of resistance is but one part."

}}
A final element of pacification invoked by scholars in this field of study is its connection to the apparent primacy of security thinking and planning in a [[capitalist economy]].  This pronouncement is often linked to [[Karl Marx]]'s assertion that "security is the supreme concept of [[Bourgeoisie|bourgeois]] society" in the [[Jewish Question]].&lt;ref&gt;Karl Marx. 1844. On the Jewish Question. https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1844/jewish-question/&lt;/ref&gt;  A connection believed to be so embedded that Rigakos has argued that "security ''is'' hegemony".&lt;ref name="redquillbooks1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="academia9"&gt;Manolov, Martin V. (2012). “[https://www.academia.edu/3592253/Anti-Security_Q_and_A_Interview_of_George_S._Rigakos Anti-Security: Q &amp; A, Interview of George S. Rigakos],” The Annual Review of Interdisciplinary Justice Research, vol. 3, pp. 9-26.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Politics==
The development of '''pacification theory''' is a re-appropriation of the historical usage of the term.  It is offered as an alternative to [[security]] as part of a broader analytic [http://www.redquillbooks.com/portfolio-posts/anti-security/ Anti-security] project.&lt;ref name="academia9"/&gt; The development of pacification theory to re-cast security is believed to help radical scholars grasp the inherent objectives and operation of [[security]] politics since [[the Enlightenment]], and is intended to give [[activists]] a ground to stand against the [[securitization]] of political discourse that increasingly surrounds the policing of [[dissent]] in the [[post-9/11]] period.

During the social uprisings in the 1960s in [[North America]] and [[Europe]] against the [[Vietnam War]], pacification came to connote [[bombing]] people into submission and waging an [[ideological]] war against the opposition. However, after the Vietnam War, pacification was dropped from the official [[discourse]] as well as from the discourse of opposition.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;Neocleous, Mark. 2008. [http://www.mqup.ca/critique-of-security-products-9780773534810.php Critique of Security]. Edinburgh University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Although approach towards the term and practices of pacification both in the concept’s sixteenth-century and twentieth-century [[Colonialism and Colonies|colonial]] meanings were somehow related to the concepts of [[war]], [[security]] and police power, the real connection between pacification and these concepts has never been revealed in the literature on [[international relations]], [[conflict studies]], [[criminology]] or [[political science]]. Neocleous&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Neocleous, Mark. 2007. “[https://www.academia.edu/7593467/Security_Liberty_and_the_Myth_of_Balance Security, Liberty and the Myth of Balance: Towards a Critique of Security Politics.]” Contemporary Political Theory 6, pp. 131-149.&lt;/ref&gt; has argued that the connection between pacification and the ideological discourse on security is related to the terms use in broader [[Western philosophy|Western]] social and [[political thought]] in general, and [[liberal theory]] in particular. In short, that [[liberalism]]’s key concept is less [[liberty]] and more security and that liberal [[doctrine]] is inherently less committed to [[peace]] and far more to legitimizing [[violence]].

In [https://www.academia.edu/2292255/Anti-security_A_Declaration Anti-security: A Declaration], Neocleous and Rigakos&lt;ref&gt;Neocleous, Mark and George S. Rigakos. 2011. “[https://www.academia.edu/2292255/Anti-security_A_Declaration Anti-security: A Declaration]”, pp. 15-21 in Anti-security. Ottawa: Red Quill Books., p.16&lt;/ref&gt; provocatively summed this argument in the following way: "In the works of the founders of the [[Liberal democracy|liberal]] tradition - that is, the founders of [[Bourgeoisie|bourgeois]] ideology - liberty is security and security is liberty. For the [[ruling class]], security always has and always will triumph over liberty because ‘liberty’ has never been intended as a counter-weight to security. Liberty has always been security’s [[lawyer]]."

From the late seventeenth and early eighteenth century onwards, the growth of towns in [[Europe]] generated a concern over “masterlesse men,” as [[Thomas Hobbes]] puts it, and their forms of behaviour exposed in [[urban area|urban]] life such as [[gambling]], [[drinking]], [[adultery]], [[blasphemy]] and wandering.&lt;ref&gt;Neocleous, Mark. 2011. “[https://www.academia.edu/7593846/A_Brighter_and_Nice_New_Life_Security_as_Pacification ‘A Brighter and Nicer New Life’: Security as Pacification.]” Social and Legal Studies 20(2), pp. 191-208.&lt;/ref&gt; Pacification, then, functions as a thread that connects sixteenth-century European [[colonialism]] and the fabrication of [[liberalism|liberal]] [[social order]] in eighteenth and nineteenth centuries to the US project in Vietnam and contemporary military exercises of [[Empire]] both throughout the globe and domestically.

==General theory==
In [http://www.oupcanada.com/catalog/9781474413664.html Security/Capital],&lt;ref&gt;Rigakos, George S. 2016. ''Security/Capital: A General Theory of Pacification'' University of Edinburgh Press&lt;/ref&gt; Rigakos offers a General Theory of Pacification.  He argues that pacification is composed of three overlapping strata: (1) Dispossession; (2) [[Exploitation of labour|Exploitation]] and (3) [[Commodification]].  Commodification is itself composed of three processes: (a) [[valorization]]; (b) prudentialization; and (c) [[fetishization]]. According to Rigakos, while different in their strategic targets of intervention, each of these three strata of pacification in their aggregate nonetheless both produce and rely on:
{{Quote box
 | quote  = "(1) the use and/ or threat of use of [[violence]]; (2) the legal, institutional, and police subversion and suppression of non-capitalist forms of subsistence and exchange; (3) the circulation of a “[[moral education]]” aimed at ideologically reinforcing capitalist exchange, the wage-labor system, and bourgeois practices and norms among workers, and, finally (4) establishing an institutional and ideological ethic of security that equates threats to any of these aspects as threats to the state of security and the private property relations it supports."

 | width = 100%
 | align = left
}}
The aggregate effect of this theory is the conclusion that the global economic system is now conditioned by pacification as it never has been before.  Rigakos suggests that "the security–
industrial complex is, materially and ideologically, the blast furnace of global capitalism, fuelling both the conditions for the system’s perpetuation while feeding relentlessly on the surpluses it has exacted."&lt;ref&gt;Rigakos, Security/Capital, p.123&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''patent war''' is a "battle" between corporations or individuals to secure [[patents]] for litigation, whether offensively or defensively. There are ongoing patent wars between the world's largest technology and software corporations. Contemporary patent wars are a global phenomenon, fought by multinational corporations based in the United States, China, Europe, Japan, Korea and Taiwan.&lt;ref name=rww&gt;{{cite news|last=Rowinski|first=Dan|title=Patent Wars Turn Tech into a Battlefield|url=http://www.readwriteweb.com/mobile/2012/06/infographic-patent-wars-turn-tech-into-a-battlefield.php|accessdate=6 August 2012|newspaper=ReadWriteWeb|date=1 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Francis|first=Theo|title=Can You Get A Patent On Being A Patent Troll?|url=https://www.npr.org/blogs/money/2012/08/01/157743897/can-you-get-a-patent-on-being-a-patent-troll|accessdate=6 August 2012|newspaper=NPR|date=2 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pcm"/&gt; Patent wars have occurred in a wide range of technologies, both in the past and in the present.

==History==
Patent wars are not a new phenomenon. In the [[Wright brothers patent war]], the [[Wright brothers]], attributed with the invention of the [[airplane]], sought to prevent competitors from manufacturing airplanes through litigation, stifling the development of the American airline industry.&lt;ref name="Lohr"&gt;{{cite news|last=Lohr|first=Steve|title=Apple-Samsung Trial Highlights Tricky Patent Wars|work=The New York Times|date=30 July 2012|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/30/technology/apple-samsung-trial-highlights-patent-wars.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alexander Graham Bell]], credited with inventing the telephone, was dragged into a patent war against his rivals, which involved, in just 11 years, 600 lawsuits.&lt;ref name="Huurdeman2003"/&gt; One notable case was Bell's lawsuit against [[Western Union]]. Western Union was backed by [[Elisha Gray]], also credited with inventing the telephone.&lt;ref name="Huurdeman2003"&gt;{{cite book|author=Anton A. Huurdeman|title=The Worldwide History of Telecommunications|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SnjGRDVIUL4C&amp;pg=PA176|accessdate=7 August 2012|date=31 July 2003|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-0-471-20505-0|pages=176–177}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The occurrence of patent wars has been shaped by the [[Information Age|digital age]], as the rapid pace of innovation makes much of the patent system obsolete.&lt;ref name=bw&gt;{{cite news|last=Popelka|first=Larry|title=Only Lawyers Win in Patent Wars|url=http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2012-04-24/patent-wars-lawyers-are-the-only-winners|accessdate=6 August 2012|newspaper=Businessweek|date=24 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1980s, technology corporations in the United States and Japan engaged in a patent war, creating a scenario where companies were forced to "fight patent with patent." This bilateral patent war, partly exaggerated by the media, subsided by the mid 1990s.&lt;ref name="Granstrand2000"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ove Granstrand|title=The Economics and Management of Intellectual Property: Towards Intellectual Capitalism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qtrkx8U2cRsC&amp;pg=PA140|accessdate=6 August 2012|date=1 October 2000|publisher=Edward Elgar Publishing|isbn=978-1-84064-463-0|pages=140–141}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Exacerbating the frequency of patent wars was the advent of [[Patent troll|patent trolling]]. The term "patent troll" was coined in the 1990s by the employees of [[Intel]] and popularized by Intel's [[Peter Detkin]]. According to Detkin, Intel was "sued for libel for the use of the term 'patent extortionists' so I came up with 'patent trolls...a patent troll is somebody who tries to make a lot of money off a patent that they are not practicing and have no intention of practicing and in most cases never practiced."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Sandburg|first=Brenda|title=Inventor's lawyer makes a pile from patents|newspaper=The Recorder|date=30 July 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1990s, federal courts began reversing earlier decisions made by the patent office that restricted the patenting of software.&lt;ref name="NPR"/&gt; In 1997, software companies [[Trend Micro]], [[Integralis]], [[McAffee]] and [[Symantec]] fought a patent war over [[antivirus]] software.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Galante|first=Suzanne|title=Trend Micro wages patent war|url=http://news.cnet.com/2100-1001-201229.html&amp;st.ne.fd.mdh|accessdate=6 August 2012|newspaper=CNET|date=8 July 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Galante|first=Suzanne|title=Symantec retreats in antivirus war|url=http://news.cnet.com/Symantec-retreats-in-antivirus-war/2100-1001_3-202833.html|accessdate=6 August 2012|newspaper=CNET|date=29 August 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1999, a patent for "one-click ordering technology" led to a patent war between [[Amazon.com]] and [[Barnes &amp; Noble]].&lt;ref name="Cohen2003"&gt;{{cite book|author=Adam Cohen|title=The Perfect Store: Inside eBay|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cANUr5KyTOsC&amp;pg=PA90|accessdate=7 August 2012|date=3 June 2003|publisher=Hachette Inc|isbn=978-0-316-16493-1|pages=90}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Spinello2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Richard Spinello|title=Cyberethics: Morality and Law in Cyberspace|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=b1L-C1SR8JcC&amp;pg=PT170|accessdate=7 August 2012|date=6 July 2010|publisher=Jones &amp; Bartlett Publishers|isbn=978-1-4496-5402-3|pages=170–173}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, Sony and Kodak engaged in a patent war over digital cameras,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Digital camera patent war hots up|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/3588463.stm|accessdate=6 August 2012|newspaper=BBC|date=1 April 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; a dispute which lasted until 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Kodak and Sony end patent dispute over digital photography inventions|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/03/technology/03iht-webkodak.4088937.html|accessdate=6 August 2012|newspaper=New York TImes|date=3 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The current [[smartphone wars]] started in the late 2000s. According to ''[[PC Magazine]]'', Apple brought the patent wars to the smartphone market by its desire to "go thermonuclear" on Google's competing [[Android (operating system)|Android]] operating system for mobile devices.&lt;ref name="pcm"&gt;{{cite news|last=Sascha|first=Segan|title=Infographic: Smartphone Patent Wars Explained|url=https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2399098,00.asp|accessdate=6 August 2012|newspaper=PC Magazine|date=19 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This triggered a "war" between major technology companies in the mobile market.&lt;ref name="pcm"/&gt; Apple has been accused of having links to the company Digitude Innovations, which has been labeled as a patent troll.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kincaid|first=Jason|title=Apple Made A Deal With The Devil (No, Worse: A Patent Troll)|url=https://techcrunch.com/2011/12/09/apple-made-a-deal-with-the-devil-no-worse-a-patent-troll/|accessdate=6 August 2012|newspaper=Techcrunch|date=9 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following this warfare, Apple itself has also been called a patent-troll.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Wilcox|first=Joe|title=Apple is a patent-troll now.|url=http://betanews.com/2011/12/20/apple-is-a-patent-troll-now/|accessdate=20 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effects and response==
{{main|Societal views on patents}}
Patents are intended to protect [[intellectual property]] and encourage innovation, granting innovative companies a temporary competitive advantage over their rivals; however, patents have been used offensively through threats of litigation. This forces companies to allocate time and money that could have been better spent on research and development.&lt;ref name="NPR"&gt;{{cite news|title=When Patents Attack|url=https://www.npr.org/blogs/money/2011/07/26/138576167/when-patents-attack|accessdate=8 August 2012|newspaper=NPR|date=22 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Businessweek]]'' has written that "only lawyers win in patent wars."&lt;ref name=bw/&gt;  

There are numerous proposals aimed at reducing the risk of patent wars. [[Twitter]] announced in 2012 an "Innovator's Patent Agreement" promising not to use its patents opportunistically and without the consent of the company's employees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Laird|first=Sam|title=Is Twitter trying to end the tech patent wars?|url=http://www.cnn.com/2012/04/18/tech/social-media/twitter-end-patent-war/index.html|accessdate=6 August 2012|newspaper=CNN|date=18 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; There have been commentators favoring abolishing patents entirely, outside of the industries that require them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Wadhwa|first=Vivek|title=Why We Need To Abolish Software Patents|url=https://techcrunch.com/2010/08/07/why-we-need-to-abolish-software-patents/|accessdate=8 August 2012|newspaper=Techcrunch|date=7 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5730">{{about|the pre-1948 contractual remedy against the Crown|the 1628 Act of Parliament that forms part of the constitutional prelude to the English Civil War|Petition of Right}}

In [[English law]], a '''petition of right''' was a [[remedy (law)|remedy]] available to subjects to recover property from [[the Crown]].&lt;ref name="bne"&gt;Bradley &amp; Ewing (2003) 'pp''770-771&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the [[Crown Proceedings Act 1947]], the [[United Kingdom|British]] Crown could not be [[lawsuit|sue]]d in [[contract]]. However, as it was seen to be desirable that Crown contractors could obtain redress, lest they be inhibited from taking on such work, the '''petition of right''' came to be used in such situations, especially after the [[Petitions of Right Act 1860]] simplified the process. Before the petition could be heard by the courts, it had to be endorsed with the words ''[[fiat justitia]]'' on the advice of the [[Home Secretary]] and [[Attorney-General]].&lt;ref name="bne"/&gt; This Latin phrase was normally translated as "Let right be done".

One of the most famous ''[[Cause célèbre|causes célèbres]]'' in English law, the [[George Archer-Shee|Archer-Shee case]], arose out of proceedings on a petition of right.&lt;ref name="Univ Pa. Law Rev"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Keedy|first=Edwin|title=A Petition of Right: Archer-Shee and the King|journal=University of Pennsylvania Law Review and American Law Journal|date=June 1939|volume=87|issue=8|pages=895 et seq.|jstor=3309184}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Carson Bio"&gt;{{cite book|last=Lewis|first=Geoffrey|title=Carson: The Man Who Divided Ireland|year=2006|publisher=Hambledon Continuum|isbn=978-1-85285-570-3|pages=288|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZG63y98ucvgC&amp;lpg=PA63&amp;dq=%22petition%20of%20right%22%20%20archer%20shee&amp;pg=PA63#v=onepage&amp;q=%22petition%20of%20right%22%20%20archer%20shee&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Section 1 of the Crown Proceedings Act 1947 allows claims for which a petition would previously have been demanded to be brought in the courts directly as against any other defendant. However, a petition and ''fiat'' still appear to be necessary for personal claims against the [[monarch]].&lt;ref name="bne"/&gt;

==Claims allowed==
A petition of right was available:&lt;ref name="eb"&gt;{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Petition#Petition of Right |display=Petition § Petition of Right |volume=21 |page=306 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*To obtain restitution of [[real property|real]] or [[personal property]] of the subject which has found its way into the hands of the Crown, or compensation if restitution could not be made; or
*To recover [[damages]] for [[breach of contract|breach of a contract]] made on behalf of the Crown, whether the breach was due to the acts or the omissions of [[employment law|servants]] of the Crown.

Where the Crown was in possession of the property of the applicant, and the [[title (property)|title]] of the Crown appeared by record, as by [[inquest of office]], the [[remedy (law)|remedy]] was somewhat different and was called '''''monstrans de droit'''''.&lt;ref name="eb"/&gt; Petition of right was not available in respect of engagements in the [[Royal Navy|naval]], [[British Army|military]] or [[civil service]], which, were not generally considered as [[Employment contract|contracts of employment]] but as appointments enjoyed ''during the pleasure'' of the Crown.&lt;ref name="eb"/&gt; This relationship based on the [[royal prerogative]] only ended in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;Bradley &amp; Ewing (2003) ''p.''272-273, [[Employment Rights Act 1996]], s.191&lt;/ref&gt; Nor was the action available for breach of public duty, ''e.g.'' a failure to perform [[treaty]] obligations, nor for [[trespass]] or [[negligence]] or other [[tort]]s by Crown servants.&lt;ref name="eb"/&gt; Where such acts were wrongful the remedy was still by action against the official as an individual and not in his official capacity.&lt;ref&gt;''Raleigh v. Goschen'' (1898) LR 1 ch.73&lt;/ref&gt;

==Procedure==
===Common law===
At [[common law]] the petition went through its earliest stages in [[Chancery (medieval office)|Chancery]]. The petition suggested a right disputing the title of the Crown, and the Crown endorsed the petition '''''soit droit fait la partie'''''. Then a commission was issued to inquire into the truth of the suggestion. After the return to the commission, the [[Attorney General for England and Wales|Attorney-General]] filed a response and the merits were determined as in any ''[[inter partes]]'' action. If the right was determined against the Crown, judgment of '''''amoveas manes''''' was given in favour of the applicant.&lt;ref name="eb"/&gt;

==Scotland and Ireland==
The law as to petitions of right applied to [[Ireland]] but not to [[Scotland]], and a right to present such a petition was also thought to exist in [[British empire|colonies]] whose law was based on the common law of England. Ultimately, in many colonies legislation was passed with respect to claims against the government which made it unnecessary to resort to a petition of right.&lt;ref name="eb"/&gt;

'''''Price v. Pennsylvania Railroad Co.''''', 113 U.S. 218 (1885), was a case where the plaintiff sued the defendant for the loss of her husband by a death which the jury found, by a special verdict, to be caused by the negligence of the company's servant or servants.&lt;ref&gt;''Price v. Pennsylvania R. Co.'', {{ussc|113|218|1885}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The verdict read as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;We find for the plaintiff in the sum of (5,000) five thousand dollars, subject to the opinion of the court on the question of law reserved, to-wit: we find that A. J. Price at the time of his death was route agent of the United States Post Office Department, duly appointed and commissioned, his route being on the Western [[Pennsylvania Railroad]] from Allegheny City to Blairsville, in the State of Pennsylvania; that his duties as such agent required him to be on the mail car on the mail train of said road to receive and deliver mail matter; that for the purpose of his business and that of the postal department, and in accordance with the laws of the United States and the regulations of the Post Office Department, and acceptance thereof by the railroad company, one end of the baggage car on the mail train was divided off and fitted up for the use of the department in carrying the mails, and that the duties of the said route agent required him to be in said room in the car during the running of the train; that said Price was daily on said train, making a round trip from Allegheny City to Blairsville and return; that on the 23d day of July, 1877, while at his post in his room on said car, Mr. Price was killed in a collision of the mail train coming west with another train of the defendant company going east.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;That said collision was caused by the negligence or misconduct of the conductor and engineer in charge of the train going east in neglecting or disobeying orders, and in failing to take necessary precaution to avoid a collision.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;We find that the Pennsylvania Railroad Company, by resolution dated April 16, 1868, accepted the provisions of the Act of Assembly, approved 4th April 1868, P.L. p. 59, and that [at the] time of the collision the Pennsylvania Railroad Company was operating the Western Pennsylvania Railroad under lease.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;If, under this finding of facts, and under the acts of Congress and acts of assembly offered in evidence, and the postal regulations in evidence, the court should be of the opinion that the plaintiffs, as widow and children of deceased, are entitled to recover, then judgment to be entered on the verdict in favor of the plaintiffs.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;If the court should be of the opinion that the law is with the defendant, then judgment to be entered in favor of the defendant non obstante veredicto.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The trial judge held that the deceased was a person engaged in and about the train, within the meaning of the act of 1868, but that he was also within the proviso as a passenger, and gave judgment for plaintiff on the verdict. The judgment was reversed by the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania on the ground that the deceased was not a passenger within the meaning of the proviso, and a judgment was rendered for defendant, to which this writ of error was prosecuted.

A person traveling on a railroad in charge of mails, under the provision of § 4000 Rev.Stat., does not thereby acquire the rights of a passenger in case he is injured on the railroad through negligence of the company's servants.

A statute of Pennsylvania passed April 15, 1851, Purdon, Tit. Negligence 2, 1093, makes the provision, now become common, for a recovery by the widow or children of a person whose death was caused by the negligence of another, of damages for the loss of the deceased.

A statute passed April 4, 1868, Purdon, Tit. Negligence 5, 1094, provides that "Where any person shall sustain personal injury or loss of life while lawfully engaged or employed on or about the road, works, depot, and premises of a railroad company, or in or about any train or car therein or thereon, of which company such person is not an employee, the right of action or recovery in all such cases against the company shall be such only as would exist if such person were an employee, provided that this section shall not apply to passengers."

{{about|the legal, clerical and academic title|other uses|Proctor (disambiguation)}}

'''Proctor''', a variant of ''[[wikt:procurator|procurator]]'', is a person who takes charge of, or acts for, another.&lt;ref name=EB1911&gt;{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Proctor |volume=22 |pages=421–422}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word "proctor" is frequently used to describe someone who oversees an [[Test (assessment)|examination]] or [[dormitory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/proctor|title=Definition of PROCTOR|author=|date=|website=www.merriam-webster.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The title is used in England in three principal contexts:&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;
* In law, a proctor is an attorney or solicitor acting in some courts.
* In religion, a proctor represents the clergy in [[Church of England]] dioceses.
* In education, a proctor is the name of university officials in certain universities, or a supervisor or [[Exam invigilator|invigilator]] during an exam.

==Law==
===Historical legal office===
A proctor was a legal practitioner in the [[ecclesiastical court|ecclesiastical]] and [[admiralty courts]].&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;  Historically, proctors were licensed by the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] to undertake the duties that were performed in [[common law]] courts by [[Solicitor#England and Wales|attorneys]] and in the courts of [[Equity (law)|equity]] by solicitors.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;  Later, the [[Judicature Acts]] of 1873 and 1875, which created the [[Senior Courts of England and Wales|Supreme Court of Judicature]], combined the three roles into the common profession of "solicitor of the Supreme Court".

In the admiralty courts, a proctor or procurator was an officer who, in conjunction with the King's Proctor, acted as the attorney or solicitor in all causes concerning the [[Admiralty|Lord High Admiral]]'s affairs in the [[High Court of Admiralty]] and other courts. The King's Proctor so acted in all causes concerning the King.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

===Current legal officers===
The '''Queen's Proctor''' (or King's Proctor) is the proctor or solicitor representing the [[The Crown|Crown]] in the courts of [[probate]] and divorce.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; The office has for many years been combined with that of the [[Treasury Solicitor]], whose formal title is Her (or His) Majesty's Procurator-General and Treasury Solicitor. In petitions of divorce, or for declaration of nullity of marriage, the Queen's Proctor may, under direction of the [[Attorney General]], intervene in the suit for the purpose of arguing any question that the court deems expedient to have argued. His or her powers are set out in section 8 of the [[Matrimonial Causes Act 1973]], and include the power to show cause against a ''[[decree nisi]]'' being made absolute,&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; usually on receipt of information indicating that the court has been misled into granting a decree. (See also the Family Proceedings Rules 1991 (as amended), Rule 2.46).

Proctor is a term that still survives in Western Australia.  Until it was amended in 1992 and later superseded by the Legal Profession Act in 2008, the Legal Practitioners Act 1893 provided for legal practitioners in Western Australia to be admitted and entitled to practise as "practitioners". That term was then defined as 'a person admitted and entitled to practise as a barrister, solicitor, attorney and proctor of the Supreme Court of Western Australia, or in any one or more of these capacities'.  Whilst it was theoretically possible to apply for admission in any of these capacities, as there was no separate qualification for such separate admissions, the standard practice (pre 1992) was for all persons to be admitted as barristers, solicitors and proctors of the Supreme Court of Western Australia.  Many survive today.

==Ecclesiastical==
A representative of the clergy in [[convocation]]. The Lower Houses of the [[Convocation of the English Clergy|Convocations of Canterbury and York]] include ''specially elected'' proctors (the deans of cathedrals and the Dean of either Jersey or Guernsey) and ''directly elected'' proctors (representing beneficed and licensed clergy, clergy with permission to officiate, archdeacons, clergy holding office in a cathedral, religious communities, universities and theological education institutions),&lt;ref&gt;''[https://www.churchofengland.org/more/policy-and-thinking/canons-church-england/section-h Canons of the Church of England]'', Canon H 2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[https://www.churchofengland.org/sites/default/files/2017-12/gs%201975%20-%20seat%20allocation%202015.pdf General Synod Elections 2015]'' (GS 1975)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
'''Proctor''' has two completely different meanings in education: it can refer either to a high official in certain universities, or to any teacher or other staff member at a university, secondary school or even elementary school when they are [[Exam invigilator|supervising the administration of a test]] or [[Test (assessment)|examination]]. In British, Canadian, Australian and South African English, persons acting in this latter capacity are referred to as ''invigilators''.

===Cambridge University===
[[File:Agar Cambridge Proctor 1815.jpg|thumb|right|Proctor of the University of Cambridge, aquatint by [[John Samuel Agar]] after [[Thomas Uwins]], from ''History of the University of Cambridge'' (1815) by [[William Combe]]]]
The early history of the office at Cambridge is obscure, but it seems that the Proctors have always represented the colleges in University proceedings.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; In the past the Proctors administered the university's finances, acted as examiners for all candidates for the degree of [[Bachelor of Arts]], prosecuted anyone suspected of unfair trading, and had a multitude of other tasks. At present their functions are twofold: (1) taking part in all university ceremonials, and (2) enforcing discipline in the case of members of the University who are ''in statu pupillari'' (undergraduates, Bachelors of Arts and [[Bachelor of Laws|Bachelors of Laws]]).&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

====Election====
At [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge University]] the Proctors are nominated every May by colleges identified in a predetermined cycle. They then serve for one year from 1 October, assisted by their Deputy Proctors and two Pro-Proctors. They must have been a member of the Senate for three years, and must have resided two years at the university. The two Pro-Proctors are not, as at Oxford, nominated by the Proctors, but are also elected by the Regent House on the nomination of the colleges, each college having the right to nominate a Pro-Proctor for the year next before that in which it nominates the Proctor (Grace of 26 February 1863). Two additional Pro-Proctors are also elected by the Senate each year, on the nomination of the Vice- Chancellor and Proctors, to assist the latter in the maintenance of discipline (Grace of 6 June 1878).&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

The Proctors for 2016–17 are Gordon Chesterman (Senior Proctor) of [[St Edmund's College, Cambridge|St Edmund's College]] and Dr Cristiano Andrea Ristuccia (Junior Proctor) of [[Trinity Hall, Cambridge|Trinity Hall]].

The Deputies to the Proctors are Dr David Woodman (Deputy to the Senior Proctor) of [[Robinson College, Cambridge|Robinson College]], David Goode (Deputy to the Senior Proctor) of [[Wolfson College, Cambridge|Wolfson College]] and Wing Commander (Retired) Richard Keith "Dick" Taplin (Deputy to the Junior Proctor) of [[Gonville &amp; Caius College, Cambridge|Gonville &amp; Caius College]]. 

The Pro-Proctors are Timothy Milner (Senior Pro-Proctor) of [[Darwin College, Cambridge|Darwin College]] and Dr Gemma Burgess (Junior Pro-Proctor) of [[Newnham College, Cambridge|Newnham College]].

The first hundred years of Proctorial records are mostly lost, but the Proctors' Office web site has a more or less complete list of the Proctors since 1314.

====Ceremonial functions====
The Proctors are ''[[ex officio]]'' members of the Board of Scrutiny, the Board of Examinations, and various other bodies. Their presence is essential at all Congregations of the Regent House, at which the Senior Proctor reads all the Graces and the Junior Proctor takes the vote of the Regent House. If any Grace is opposed by any member of the Senate saying ''non-placet'', the Proctors take the votes of those present and announce the result. Graces are offered not only for making changes in University Statutes and Ordinances and for appointing examiners and the like, but also for granting degrees. When a degree is to be taken, the college of the candidate presents a ''supplicat'' or petition for the degree; this petition is approved by the Regent House, if and when they have satisfied themselves that the candidate has fulfilled the conditions, and is read at the Congregation by the Senior Proctor: these ''supplicats'' are practically never opposed, but Graces for new Statutes and Ordinances are frequently opposed, and on very important occasions such as the election of a new Chancellor many hundreds of non-resident members of the Senate come up to record their votes.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

====Disciplinary functions====
The proctors' powers as to discipline have a very long history. As far as concerns members of the university they have authority to impose certain fines for minor offences, such as not wearing academic dress on occasions when it is ordered, and also to order a student not to be out of their college after a certain hour for a certain number of days ("gating"). For more serious offences, the proctor generally reports the matter to the authorities of the offender's college to be dealt with by them, or as a last resort brings the offender before the university court of discipline, which has power to rusticate or expel. The power of the proctors over persons who are not members of the university dates from charters granted by [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]] and [[James I of England|James I]], which empowered the university authorities to search for undesirable characters, men and women, rogues, vagabonds, and other ''personas de male suspectas'' (persons suspected of evil), and punish them by imprisonment or banishment. In recent times this power was often exercised with respect to prostitutes. The proctors promenaded the streets attended by their servants (the bulldogs) who are always sworn in as special constables. (They are now called 'Constables', and retain full police powers of arrest within 5 miles (8 km) of Great St Mary's Church, deemed to be the centre of the University; Proctors now do not have power of arrest.) If occasion arose, the proctor could arrest a suspected woman and have her taken to the [[Spinning House]] (for which [[Thomas Hobson]] the carrier had left an endowment); the next day the woman was brought before the [[List of Vice-Chancellors of the University of Cambridge|vice-chancellor]], who had power to commit her to the Spinning House; as a general rule the sentence was for no longer than three weeks. For this purpose the Vice-Chancellor sat ''[[in camera]]'' and the jurisdiction had nothing to do with that of the vice-chancellor's court.{{clarifyme|date=June 2016}} In 1898 attention was called to this procedure by the case of a girl named Daisy Hopkins, who was arrested and committed to the Spinning House. Application was made on her behalf to the [[Queen's Bench Division]] for a writ of ''[[habeas corpus]]'', and when the application came on it appeared that there had been a technical irregularity (the prisoner not having been formally charged when brought before the Vice-Chancellor); so the writ was granted and the prisoner released. She afterwards brought an action against the proctor, which failed. It was then decided to abolish the practice of hearing these cases ''in camera''. The whole practice was, however, objected to by the authorities of the town, and after a conference an agreement was reached: the proctorial jurisdiction over persons not members of the university was abolished (1904).&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

The Junior Proctor has special responsibility for university societies and for resolving disputes arising from the Cambridge University Students' Union and the Graduate Union.

The Special Pro-Proctor for Motor Vehicles is responsible for licensing the keeping and using of motor vehicles (other than mopeds) within {{convert|10|mi|km}} of [[Great St Mary's Church]] by University students who have not yet reached MA status and are in residence in term or in the Long Vacation period of residence. The Motor Proctor also has the power to impose a fine of up to £175 on students breaching the regulations on the keeping and using of motor vehicles.

===Oxford University===
[[File:Oxford Proctor 1674.jpg|right|thumb|1674 engraving of a Proctor in the [[University of Oxford]].  From ''Habitus Academicorum'', by George Edwards.]]
{{See also|Oxford University Police}}
The Proctors of [[Oxford University]] are senior officers of the University who are responsible for enforcing University discipline and sanctions, for handling complaints against the University, and for conducting public [[Test (assessment)|examination]]s (often at the [[Examination Schools]]). They are elected annually by the [[colleges of Oxford University|colleges]]. Two Proctors are elected each year: a Senior and a Junior Proctor.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.admin.ox.ac.uk/proctors/ About the Proctors' Office], University of Oxford website&lt;/ref&gt;

The reform of the university statutes in 2002 reorganised the disciplinary system of the University and reduced the powers of the Proctors. However, they still act as [[ombudsman|ombudsmen]] for the University, and handle formal complaints by and against students (although more minor disciplinary matters are usually dealt with by the [[Dean (education)|Dean]] of each college). They have the power to issue [[Fine (penalty)|fines]] to members of the University for numerous offences, including [[cheat]]ing in examinations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ox.ac.uk/gazette/2004-5/supps/1_4728.htm Oration by the Senior Proctor], Oxford University Gazette, 23 March 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to 2003, the Proctors were aided in disciplinary matters by the [[Oxford University Police]] (who wore [[bowler hat]]s and were generally known as "Bulldogs"); the University Police were a private constabulary with full powers of arrest within the precincts of the University and within four miles (6&amp;nbsp;km) of any University building.&lt;ref name="kofk"&gt;p194-5, Bruce, Alastair and Calder, Julian, ''Keepers of the Kingdom'' (Cassell, 1987), {{ISBN|0-304-36201-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ox.ac.uk/gazette/1999-00/weekly/230300/oration.htm Oration by the Senior Proctor], Oxford University Gazette, 23 March 2000&lt;/ref&gt; However, after receiving public criticism in 2002 for their exercise of authority over citizens of Oxford who were not members of the University,&lt;ref name="ot"&gt;[http://www.oxfordmail.co.uk/archive/2002/05/22/6593799.University_police_branded__too_powerful_/?ref=arc University police branded 'too powerful'] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402101618/http://www.oxfordmail.co.uk/archive/2002/05/22/6593799.University_police_branded__too_powerful_/?ref=arc |date=2 April 2015 }}, ''Oxford Times'', 22 May 2002&lt;/ref&gt; the force was disbanded by the University Council in 2003, due partly to the excessive expense of complying with new Government requirements on police training and complaints procedures.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/opinion/main.jhtml?xml=/opinion/2002/10/15/dp1501.xml Straw rejoices as Oxford's Bulldogs are put down], ''The Daily Telegraph'', 15 October 2002&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="gaz2"&gt;[http://www.ox.ac.uk/gazette/2002-3/weekly/270303/notc.htm#1Ref Oration by the Senior Proctor], Oxford University Gazette, 27 March 2003&lt;/ref&gt; Today, the Constables have been redesignated as "Proctors' Officers" and continue to serve under the Proctors, but no longer have the powers of police constables.

===Online Proctoring===
Online proctoring is the monitoring or invigilation of assessments taken remotely.

Online proctors verify test-taker identity and monitor to prevent cheating using a variety of methods, including live, record-and-review, and automated proctoring. Online proctoring services work with colleges, universities, corporations, and other certification providers to offer identity verification services and assessment monitoring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://examity.com/docs/BBJ_Article.pdf|title=Mass. tech firm that thwarts cheaters of online tests is in ’super growth mode’|website=Boston Business Journal|accessdate=2017-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cit web|url=https://rutgersonline.desk.com/customer/en/portal/articles/2900365-proctortrack|title=What is Proctortrack?|website=rutgersonline.desk|accessdate=13 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;


====Background====
Demand for online proctoring has expanded in recent years as a result of rapid expansions in online learning. In 2006, the Department of Education waived&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.worldwidelearn.com/education-advisor/indepth/financial-aid-online.php|title=Down with the 50 Percent Rule: Up with Online Education Financial Aid|website=World Wide Learn|accessdate=2017-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; the so-called “50 percent rule,” which stipulated that U.S. students in online degree programs could only receive federal student aid if half of their programs were campus-based. Today, one in three students take&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.brookings.edu/research/promises-and-pitfalls-of-online-education/|title=Promises and pitfalls of online education|website=Brookings|accessdate=2017-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; at least one course online during their college career. In addition, instructors in face-to-face classes can also administer exams online.

Higher education institutions around the world make use of online proctoring for tens of thousands of exams. The 17 campuses of the University of North Carolina proctor&lt;ref name="IHEonlineExamProctoring"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.insidehighered.com/digital-learning/article/2017/05/10/online-exam-proctoring-catches-cheaters-raises-concerns|title=Online Exam Proctoring Catches Cheaters, Raises Concerns|website=Insde Higher Ed|accessdate=2017-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; between 30,000 and 40,000 exams online per year. At the fully online Western Governors University, 30,000 exams are proctored online each month. Recent estimates suggest&lt;ref name="IHEonlineExamProctoring" /&gt; that there are about 15 providers of online proctoring.

====Research on Online Proctoring====
Research suggests that students are equally likely to cheat online&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.proctortrack.com|title=ProctorTrack online proctoring|website=Online Test Takers Today|accessdate=2017-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; as they are in person.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usnews.com/education/online-education/articles/2014/06/17/think-twice-before-cheating-in-online-courses|title=Think Twice Before Cheating in Online Courses|website=US News and World Report|accessdate=2017-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.facultyfocus.com/articles/online-education/do-online-students-cheat-more-on-tests/|title=Do Online Students Cheat More on Tests?|website=Faculty Focus|accessdate=2017-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.insidehighered.com/digital-learning/views/2017/02/06/robert-ubell-online-cheating-and-what-colleges-can-do-about-it|title=Online Cheating|website=Inside Higher Ed|accessdate=2017-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, one study found that nearly three-quarters of college students hold the perception that cheating online is easier than cheating in person.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.westga.edu/~distance/ojdla/spring131/watson131.html|title=Cheating in the Digital Age: Do Students Cheat More in Online Courses?|website=University of West Georgia|accessdate=2017-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, USA Today reported on research by Examity which suggests that 6% of students violate rules for proctored online exams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pressreader.com/usa/usa-today-us-edition/20160415/281530815190023|title=Cheating on Finals|website=USA Today|accessdate=2017-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some online proctoring providers give colleges and universities access to anonymized, aggregated data on proctoring and cheating rates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://edtechmagazine.com/higher/article/2017/07/universities-use-analytics-authentication-prevent-cheating-online-courses|title=Universities Use Analytics, Authentication to Prevent Cheating in Online Courses|website=EdTech: Focus on Higher Education|accessdate=2017-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; These analytics tools allow institutions to measure their violation rates against other schools, as well as to track incidents by time of year and type of course, among other metrics.

{{Sex and the law}}

'''Prostitution law''' varies widely from country to country, and between jurisdictions within a country. At one extreme, [[prostitution]] or [[sex trade|sex work]] is legal in some places and regarded as a [[profession]], while at the other extreme, it is a crime [[punishable by death]] in some other places.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uri.edu/artsci/wms/hughes/iran.htm |title=Iran – Facts on Trafficking and Prostitution |publisher=Uri.edu |accessdate=16 January 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141008164248/http://www.uri.edu/artsci/wms/hughes/iran.htm |archivedate=8 October 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In many jurisdictions, prostitution – the commercial exchange of sex for money, goods, service, or some other benefit agreed upon by the transacting parties – is [[Crime|illegal]], while in others it is [[legal]], but surrounding activities, such as soliciting in a public place, operating a [[brothel]], and [[pimping]], may be illegal. In many jurisdictions where prostitution is legal, it is regulated; in others it is unregulated. Where exchange of sex for money is criminalized, it may be the sex worker (most commonly), the client, or both, who are subject to prosecution.

Prostitution has been condemned as a single form of [[human rights]] abuse, and an attack on the dignity and worth of human beings, while other schools of thought state that sex work is a legitimate occupation; whereby a person trades or exchanges sexual acts for money and/or goods. Some believe that women in developing countries are especially vulnerable to [[sexual exploitation]] and [[human trafficking]], while others distinguish this practice from the global sex industry, in which "sex work is done by consenting adults, where the act of selling or buying sexual services is not a violation of human rights."&lt;ref name="Open"&gt;{{cite web|title=Understanding Sex Work in an Open Society|url=http://www.opensocietyfoundations.org/explainers/understanding-sex-work-open-society|website=Open Society Foundations|publisher=Open Society Foundations|accessdate=4 January 2014|date=June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term "sex work" is used interchangeably with "prostitution" in this article, in accordance with the World Health Organisation (WHO 2001; WHO 2005) and the United Nations (UN 2006; UNAIDS 2002).&lt;ref name="Ireland"&gt;{{cite web|title=FAQ |url=http://www.sexworkersallianceireland.org/frequently.html |website=Sex Workers Alliance Ireland |publisher=Sex Workers Alliance Ireland |accessdate=4 January 2014 |year=2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140118201244/http://www.sexworkersallianceireland.org/frequently.html |archivedate=18 January 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
In most countries, sex work is controversial. Members of certain religions oppose prostitution, viewing it as contrary or a threat to their moral codes, while other parties view prostitution as a "necessary evil". Sex worker activists and organizations believe the issue of sex worker human rights is of greatest importance, including those related to freedom of speech, travel, immigration, work, marriage, parenthood, insurance, health insurance, and housing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=International Committee for Prostitutes' Rights: World Charter For Prostitutes' Rights|url=http://www.bayswan.org/ICPRChart.html|website=Prostitutes Education Network|publisher=Prostitutes Education Network|accessdate=4 January 2014|year=1985}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some feminist organizations are opposed to prostitution, considering it a form of exploitation in which males dominate women, and as a practice that is the result of a patriarchal social order. For example, the [[European Women's Lobby]], which bills itself as the largest umbrella organization of women’s associations in the [[European Union]], has condemned prostitution as "an intolerable form of male violence".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.womenslobby.eu/spip.php?article472&amp;lang=en |title=European Women's Lobby Européen des femmes : Prostitution in Europe: 60 Years of Reluctance |publisher=Womenslobby.eu |date=1 December 2009|accessdate=16 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2014, the members of the European Parliament voted in a non-binding resolution, (adopted by 343 votes to 139; with 105 abstentions), in favor of the '[[Prostitution_in_Sweden#Current_legal_status|Swedish Model]]' of criminalizing the buying, but not the selling of sex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/news-room/content/20140221IPR36644/html/Punish-the-client-not-the-prostitute |title=Punish the client, not the prostitute |publisher=Europarl.europa.eu |date= 2014-02-26|accessdate=2015-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, the Council of Europe has made a similar recommendation, stating that "While each system presents advantages and disadvantages, policies prohibiting the purchase of sexual services are those that are more likely to have a positive impact on reducing trafficking in human beings".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=MENDES BOTA |url=http://www.assembly.coe.int/nw/xml/XRef/Xref-DocDetails-EN.asp?fileid=20559&amp;wrqid=0&amp;wrqref=&amp;ref=1&amp;lang=EN |title=Parliamentary Assembly's Documents |publisher=Assembly.coe.int |date= |accessdate=2015-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.womenlobby.org/spip.php?article6548&amp;lang=en |title=The EWL welcomes the Council of Europe Parliamentary Assembly's resolution on prostitution, trafficking and modern slavery in Europe - European Women's Lobby |publisher=Womenlobby.org |date= |accessdate=2015-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Wolfenden report|Wolfenden Committee Report]] (1957), which informed the debate in the United Kingdom, states:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
[the function of the [[criminal law]] is] to preserve public order and decency, to protect the citizen from what is injurious or offensive and to provide safeguards against the exploitation and corruption of others,&amp;nbsp;... It is not, in our view, the function of the law to intervene in the private lives of citizens, or to seek to enforce any particular code of behaviour, further than is necessary to carry out the purposes of what we have outlined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.glbtqarchive.com/ssh/wolfenden_report_S.pdf |title= Wolfenden Report |last= Summers |first= Claude J. |date= |website= GLBTQ |publisher= |access-date= 18 November 2017 |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Views on what the best legal framework on prostitution should be are often influenced by whether one can view prostitution as morally acceptable or not; indeed [[Save the Children]] wrote:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Save the Children Norway (Nepal) |url=http://www.savethechildren.net/nepal/key_issues/traffdefinition.html |title=Definition of Trafficking - Save the Children Nepal |date=2007-11-20 |accessdate=2015-09-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071120150137/http://www.savethechildren.net/nepal/key_issues/traffdefinition.html |archivedate=20 November 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; "The issue however, gets mired in controversy and confusion when prostitution too is considered as a violation of the basic human rights of both adult women and minors, and equal to sexual exploitation per se. From this standpoint then, trafficking and prostitution become conflated with each other."

In December 2012, UNAIDS, the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS, released the "Prevention and treatment of HIV and other sexually transmitted infections for sex workers in low- and middle- income countries" document that contains the following "Good practice recommendations":

*All countries should work toward decriminalization of sex work and elimination of the unjust application of non-criminal laws and regulations against sex workers.†
*Governments should establish antidiscrimination and other rights-respecting laws to protect against discrimination and violence, and other violations of rights faced by sex workers in order to realize their human rights and reduce their vulnerability to HIV infection and the impact of AIDS. Antidiscrimination laws and regulations should guarantee sex workers’ right to social, health and financial services.
*Health services should be made available, accessible and acceptable to sex workers based on the principles of avoidance of stigma, non-discrimination and the right to health.
*Violence against sex workers is a risk factor for HIV and must be prevented and addressed in partnership with sex workers and sex worker led organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New guidelines to better prevent HIV in sex workers|url=http://www.unaids.org/en/resources/presscentre/featurestories/2012/december/20121212sexworkguidance/|website=UNAIDS|publisher=United Nations|accessdate=4 January 2014|date=12 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal themes==
Legal themes tend to focus on four issues: [[victimization]] (including potential victimhood), ethics and [[morality]], [[freedom of choice|freedom of the individual]], and general benefit or harm to society (including harm arising indirectly from matters connected to prostitution).

===General===

Many people who support legal prostitution argue that prostitution is a consensual sex act between adults and a victimless crime, thus the government should not prohibit this practice.

Many anti-prostitution advocates hold that prostitutes themselves are often victims, arguing that prostitution is a practice which can lead to serious psychological and often physical long-term effects for the prostitutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ruhama.ie/easyedit/files/Ruhama-NextStep-6.pdf |title=Next Step |website=Ruhama |accessdate=15 March 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110410140946/http://www.ruhama.ie/easyedit/files/Ruhama-NextStep-6.pdf |archivedate=10 April 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prostitutionresearch.com/how_prostitution_works/000012.html |title=Prostitution Research &amp; Education Website |publisher=Prostitutionresearch.com |accessdate=16 January 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120111074300/http://www.prostitutionresearch.com/how_prostitution_works/000012.html |archivedate=11 January 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://archpsyc.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/full/65/3/337#SEC2 |title=Arch Gen Psychiatry – Prevalence and Health Correlates of Prostitution Among Patients Entering Treatment for Substance Use Disorders, March 2008, Burnette et al. 65 (3): 337 |journal=Archives of General Psychiatry |volume=65 |issue=3 |pages=337–44 |doi=10.1001/archpsyc.65.3.337 |pmid=18316680 |accessdate=16 January 2012|year=2008 |last1=Burnette |first1=Mandi L |last2=Lucas |first2=Emma |last3=Ilgen |first3=Mark |last4=Frayne |first4=Susan M |last5=Mayo |first5=Julia |last6=Weitlauf |first6=Julie C }}&lt;/ref&gt; They may also argue that the act of prostitution is not by definition a fully consensual act, as they say that all prostitutes are "forced" to sell sex, either by somebody else or by the unfortunate circumstances of their lives (such as poverty, lack of opportunity, drug addiction, a history of childhood abuse or neglect, etc.).{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

===Economic and health issues===

It is argued{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}} that street prostitution is not victimless as it may damage the reputation and quality of life in the neighbourhood and diminish the value of property. [[Peter De Marneffe]] notes that many prostitutes have not finished school, affecting their ability to be able to have a career that they might have preferred. Therefore, prostitution also affects the application of their talent in other areas of the economy in which they can succeed.{{Citation needed|date=February 2017}}
Maxwell (2000) and other researcher have found substantial evidence that there is strong co-occurrence between prostitution, drug use, drug selling, and involvement in non-drug crimes, particularly property crime. Because the activity is considered criminal in many jurisdictions, its substantial revenues are not contributing to the tax revenues of the state, and its workers are not routinely screened for sexually transmitted diseases which is dangerous in cultures favouring unprotected sex and leads to significant expenditure in the health services. According to the ''Estimates of the costs of crime in Australia'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aic.gov.au/publications/tandi/ti39.pdf |title=Estimates of the Cost of Crime in Australia |accessdate=15 March 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051215122421/http://www.aic.gov.au:80/publications/tandi/ti39.pdf |archivedate=15 December 2005 |date=2018-09-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; there is an "estimated $96 million loss of taxation revenue from undeclared earnings of prostitution".
On top of these physical issues, it is also argued that there are psychological issues that prostitutes face from certain experiences and through the duration or repetition. Some go through experiences that may result "in lasting feelings of worthlessness, shame, and self-hatred".&lt;ref&gt;''Liberalism and Prostitution'' - Peter de Marneffe&lt;/ref&gt; De Marneffe further argues that this may affect the prostitute's ability to perform sexual acts for the purpose of building a trusting intimate relationship, which may be important for their partner. The lack of a healthy relationship can lead to higher divorce rates and can influence unhealthy relationship to their children, influencing their future relationships. Although this is more difficult to control by law, it should be considered when creating policies in protecting prostitutes' psychological health.{{According to whom|date=February 2017}}

Condom use is not always a part of sex work, and if sex work were legalized, this could change. By keeping prostitution illegal, there are no laws to govern how the work is performed. It is a well-known fact{{According to whom|date=February 2017}} that condoms help reduce the spread of sexually transmitted diseases, including AIDS. If prostitution was legalized, one of the laws could be the requirement of the use of condoms. It was reported in 2010 that out of eighty-six countries, only about twenty eight countries reported regular condom use in sex work ("sex workers").{{Citation needed|date=February 2017}} If sex work was legalized, the amount of condom use would increase, leading to better protection for both the worker and the client.{{Citation needed|date=February 2017}}

===Human trafficking===

{{Main|Human trafficking}} {{See also|Forced prostitution}}

The United Nations [[Convention for the Suppression of the Traffic in Persons and the Exploitation of the Prostitution of Others]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Convention for the Suppression of the Traffic in Persons and of the Exploitation of the Prostitution of Others|url=http://www.unhchr.ch/html/menu3/b/33.htm|publisher=Office of the High Commissioner  for Human Rights|accessdate=10 April 2018 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20090721162943/http://www.unhchr.ch/html/menu3/b/33.htm |archive-date=21 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; favors criminalizing the activities of those seen as exploiting or coercing prostitutes (so-called "pimping" and "procuring" laws), while leaving sex workers free from regulation. The Convention states that "prostitution and the accompanying evil of the traffic in persons for the purpose of prostitution are incompatible with the dignity and worth of the human person".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/trafficpersons.htm |title=Convention for the Suppression of the Traffic in Persons and of the Exploitation of the Prostitution of Others |publisher=.ohchr.org |accessdate=16 January 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120508080409/http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/trafficpersons.htm |archivedate=8 May 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sigma Huda]], a UN special reporter on trafficking in persons said: "For the most part, prostitution as actually practiced in the world usually does satisfy the elements of trafficking. It is rare that one finds a case in which the path to prostitution and/or a person’s experience with prostitution does not involve, at the very least, an abuse of power and/or an abuse of vulnerability. Power and vulnerability in this context must be understood to include disparities based on gender, race, ethnicity and poverty. Put simply the road to prostitution and life within “the life” is rarely marked by empowerment or adequate options."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chaste.org.uk/public_documents/CJI_Briefing_Doc_CARE_CHASTE_001.pdf |title=Prostitution and Human Trafficking: Tackling Demand The Criminal Justice and Immigration Bill: A Briefing from CARE |accessdate=19 February 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120305202011/http://www.chaste.org.uk/public_documents/CJI_Briefing_Doc_CARE_CHASTE_001.pdf |archivedate=5 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ontheissuesmagazine.com/july08/july2008_5.php |title=Summer 2008: "It's Not TV, Its Sexploitation" Protest Against Home Box Office by Norma Ramos |publisher=On The Issues Magazine |accessdate=16 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, sex worker activists and organizations distinguish between human trafficking and legitimate sex work, and assert the importance of recognizing that trafficking is not synonymous with sex work. The Sex Workers Alliance Ireland organization explains: "victims of human trafficking may be forced to work in industries such as agriculture, domestic service as well as the sex industry. It is critical to distinguish human trafficking, which is a violation of human rights, from voluntary migration." The Open Society Foundations organization states: "sex work is done by consenting adults, where the act of selling or buying sexual services is not a violation of human rights. In fact, sex workers are natural allies in the fight against trafficking. The UNAIDS Guidance Note on HIV and Sex Work recognizes that sex worker organizations are best positioned to refer people who are victims of trafficking to appropriate services."&lt;ref name="Open" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ireland" /&gt;

According to a 2007 report by the UNODC ([[United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime]]), the most common destinations for victims of human trafficking are [[Thailand]], Japan, [[Israel]], Belgium, the [[Netherlands]], Germany, [[Italy]], Turkey, and the US.&lt;ref name="news.bbc.co.uk"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/6497799.stm |work=BBC News | title=UN highlights human trafficking | date=26 March 2007 | accessdate=7 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The major sources of trafficked persons include Thailand, China, [[Nigeria]], Albania, [[Bulgaria]], Belarus, [[Moldova]], and [[Ukraine]].&lt;ref name="news.bbc.co.uk"/&gt;

Researchers at Göteborg University released a report in 2010 that argued that prostitution laws affect trafficking flows.&lt;ref&gt;Jakobsson, Niklas and Andreas Kotsadam (2010).

===Legislation models===
NGOs, academics and government departments&lt;ref name="canada"&gt;{{cite web|title=Current Publications: Law, justice and rights: Prostitution:  A Review of Legislation in Selected Countries (PRB 03-29E)|url=https://lop.parl.ca/content/lop/ResearchPublications/prb0329-e.htm#Overview|website=Library of Parliament|accessdate=7 March 2018|language=en-CA}}&lt;/ref&gt; often categorise the approach to prostitution laws and approach into 5 models:

|}

====Prohibitionism====
All aspects of prostitution are criminalised. Often the sex trade is seen as a violation of human dignity, moral or religious beliefs.&lt;ref name="canada" /&gt; e.g. [[Russia]]&lt;ref name="coe"&gt;{{cite web|title=Prostitution – which stance to take?|url=http://assembly.coe.int/nw/xml/XRef/X2H-Xref-ViewHTML.asp?FileID=11596&amp;Lang=EN|website=[[Council of Europe]]|accessdate=7 March 2018|date=9 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Also known as "criminalization".)&lt;ref name="All Women"/&gt;

====Abolitionism==== 
Whilst prostitution itself is legal, 3rd party involvement is generally prohibited. Solicitation is also often prohibited. Whilst this model recognises prostitutes may chose work in the trade, it is morally wrong. Laws are designed to stop prostitution impacting on the public.&lt;ref name="canada" /&gt; e.g. [[England]]&lt;ref name="canada" /&gt;

====Neo-abolitionism====
Neo-abolitionists believe there is no free choice for people entering prostitution, it violates their human rights and that prostitution is the sale and consumption of human bodies. Whilst prostitutes themselves commit no crime, clients and any third party involvement is criminalised.&lt;ref name="canada" /&gt; e.g. [[Sweden]]&lt;ref name="canada" /&gt; (Also called the "[[Prostitution_in_Sweden#Current_legal_status|Swedish model]]" or "Nordic model".)&lt;ref name="catwa"&gt;{{cite web|title=DEMAND CHANGE: UNDERSTANDING THE NORDIC APPROACH TO PROSTITUTION|url=http://www.catwa.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/NORDIC-MODEL-2017-booklet-FINAL-single-page.pdf|website=[[Coalition Against Trafficking in Women]] Australia |accessdate=7 March 2018|date=8 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="lse"&gt;{{cite web|title=The 'Nordic model' of prostitution law is a myth|url=http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/europpblog/2014/01/03/the-nordic-model-of-prostitution-law-is-a-myth/|website=[[London School of Economics]]|accessdate=7 March 2018|date=3 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Legalization==== 
Whilst prostitution is not prohibited, there is legislation to control and regulate it.&lt;ref name="canada" /&gt; The extent and type of control varies from country to country and may be regulated by work permits, licensing or tolerance zones.&lt;ref name="canada" /&gt; e.g. The [[Netherlands]]&lt;ref name="canada" /&gt; (also called "regulationist".)&lt;ref name="coe" /&gt;

====Decriminalization====
{{main|Decriminalizing sex work}}
The decriminalization of sex work is the removal of criminal penalties for sex work.&lt;ref name="All Women"&gt;{{cite web|title=All Women, All Rights: Sex Workers Included |url=http://www.genderhealth.org/files/uploads/change/publications/All_Women_Alll_Rights_Sex_Workers_Included_Report.pdf |publisher=Center for Health and Gender Equity}}&lt;/ref&gt; In most countries, [[sex work]], the consensual provision of sexual services for money or goods,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Overs|first1=Cheryl|title=Sex Workers: Part of the Solution|url=http://www.who.int/hiv/topics/vct/sw_toolkit/115solution.pdf|website=World Health Organization|accessdate=28 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; is criminalized. Removing criminal prosecution for sex workers creates a safer and healthier environment&lt;ref name="Aziza"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ahmed|first=Aziza|title=Feminism, power, and sex work in the context of HIV/Aids: consequences for women's health |url=http://www.law.harvard.edu/students/orgs/jlg/vol341/225-258.pdf |journal=Harvard Journal of Law and Gender|date=1 January 2011|volume=34|issue=1|page=225 |accessdate=29 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and allows them to live with less social exclusion and stigma. e.g. [[New Zealand]]&lt;ref name="canada" /&gt;

==Demographic impact==

===Gender===
Although prostitution is mainly performed by female prostitutes there are also [[Male prostitution|male]], [[transgender]] and [[transvestite]] prostitutes performing straight and/or gay sex work. In [[Vienna]], in April 2007, there were 1,352 female and 21 male prostitutes officially registered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://diestandard.at/2894105|title=Ohne Schutz als "neuer Kick"|trans-title=Without protection as "new Kick"|language=de|newspaper=Der Standard|location=Austria|date=24 May 2007|accessdate=9 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The number of prostitutes who are not registered (and therefore work illegally) is not known. A recent study by [[TAMPEP]], on the prostitute population from Germany, estimated that 93% of prostitutes were female, 3% transgender and 4% male.&lt;ref name=tampep&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.amnestyforwomen.de/_notes/FInal%20Report%20TAMPEP%208%20BRD%202009.pdf |title=Final Report TAMPEP 8, Germany |work=[[TAMPEP]] reports |date=October 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110301101214/http://www.amnestyforwomen.de/_notes/FInal%20Report%20TAMPEP%208%20BRD%202009.pdf |archivedate=1 March 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Arrest statistics show that in those [[Sovereign state|states]] where buying and selling sex are equally illegal, the tendency is to arrest the service provider and not the customer, even though there are significantly more customers than sellers. Thus, it is a fact that more women than men are arrested, and the true extent of the crime is underreported. James (1982) reports that, in the United States, the arrest ratio of women to men was 3:2, but notes that many of the men arrested were the prostitutes rather than the clients.

===Developed vs. developing countries===
"By 1975, Thailand, with the help of World Bank economists, had instituted a National Plan of Tourist Development, which specifically underwrote the sex industry ... Without directly subsidising prostitution, the Act [the Entertainment Places Act] referred repeatedly to the personal services' sector. According to Thai feminist Sukyana Hantrakul, the law 'was enacted to pave the way for whorehouses to be legalised in the guise of massage parlours, bars, nightclubs, tea houses, etc." See Aarons Sach, "A prostitute at nine," The Times of India Sunday Review, 22 January 1995. With particular reference to children, the United Nations [[Convention on the Rights of the Child]] creates specific obligations. Article 34 stipulates that:
:State Parties undertake to protect the child from all forms of sexual exploitation and sexual abuse. For these purposes, State Parties shall, in particular, take all appropriate national, bilateral, and multilateral measures to prevent:
::The inducement or coercion of a child to engage in any unlawful sexual activity.
::The exploitative use of children in prostitution or other unlawful sexual practices.
::The exploitative use of children in pornographic performances and materials.
As of 2000, twenty four countries had enacted legislation criminalising [[child sex tourism]], e.g. in Australia, the Crimes (Child Sex Tourism) Amendment Act 1994 covers a wide range of sexual activities with children under the age of 16 committed overseas. Laws with extraterritorial application are intended to fill the gap when countries are unwilling or unable to take action against known offenders. The rationale is that child-sex offenders should not escape justice simply because they are in a position to return to their home country. There is little research into whether the [[child sex tourism]] legislation has any real deterrent effect on adults determined to have sex with children overseas. It may be that these people are
simply more careful in their activities as a result of the laws. There are three obvious problems:
*the low level of reporting of sexual offences by child victims or their parents;
*the poverty which motivates the decision to survive economically through the provision of sexual services; and
*the criminal justice systems which, in the Third World country may lack transparency, and in the First World country may involve hostile and intrusive cross-examination of child witnesses with no adult witnesses to corroborate their evidence.

==Views of prohibitionists==
{{See also|Feminist views on prostitution|International Abolitionist Federation}}

In most countries where prostitution is illegal, the prohibition of the sex trade is subject to debate and controversy among some people and some organizations, with some voices saying that the fact that prostitution is illegal increases criminal activities and negatively affects the prostitutes.

Those who support prohibition or abolition of prostitution&lt;ref name="Lakeman"&gt;{{cite web | last = Lakeman | first = Lee | title = A feminist definition of abolition | url = http://www.rapereliefshelter.bc.ca/campaigns/abolition-prostitution/abolition-prostitution | date = 2008 | website = rapereliefshelter.bc.ca | publisher = [[Vancouver Rape Relief &amp; Women's Shelter]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; argue that keeping prostitution illegal is the best way to prevent abusive and dangerous activities ([[child prostitution]], [[human trafficking]] etc.). They argue that a system which allows legalized and regulated prostitution  has very negative effects and does not improve the situation of the prostitutes; such legal systems only lead to crime and abuse: many women who work in licensed [[brothels]] are still controlled by outside [[pimps]]; many brothel owners are criminals themselves; the creation of a legal and regulated prostitution industry  only leads to another parallel illegal industry, as many women do not want to register and work legally (since this would rob them of their anonymity) and other women can not be hired by legal brothels because of underlying problems (e.g., [[drug abuse]]); legalizing prostitution  makes it more socially acceptable to buy sex, creating a huge demand for prostitutes (both by local men and by foreigners engaging in [[sex tourism]]) and, as a result, human trafficking and underage prostitution increase in order to satisfy this demand.&lt;ref name=Lakeman /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Farley | first = Melissa | author-link = Melissa Farley | title = Myths and facts about Nevada legal prostitution | url = http://prostitutionresearch.com/2009/02/23/myths-facts-about-nevada-legal-prostitution/ | publisher = [[Prostitution Research and Education (organization)|Prostitution Research]] | date = March 2009 }} [http://awakenreno.org/myths-and-facts-about-nevada-legal-prostitution/ Online.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Jeffreys | first = Sheila | author-link = Sheila Jeffreys | title = The legalisation of prostitution: a failed social experiment | url = http://sisyphe.org/article.php3?id_article=697 | website = Sisyphe.org | publisher = Sisyphe | date = 15 February 2004 |accessdate=16 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Hughes | first = Donna M. | author-link = Donna M.

A five-country survey of 175 men for the International Organisation for Migration found that 75% preferred female prostitutes aged 25 or under, and over 20% preferred those aged 18 or under, although "generally clients did not wish to buy sex from prostitutes they thought to be too young to consent to the sexual encounter."&lt;ref name="Anderson"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Anderson | first1 = Bridget | last2 = O'Connell Davidson | first2 = Julia | title = Is trafficking in human beings demand driven?

Some have argued that an extremely high level of violence is inherent to prostitution; they claim that many prostitutes have been the subject of violence, rape and coercion before entering prostitution including as children,&lt;ref name="Silbert and Pines"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Silbert | first1 = Mimi H. | last2 = Pines | first2 = Ayala M. | author-link1 = Mimi Silbert | title = Entrance into prostitution | journal = [[Youth &amp; Society]] | volume = 13 | issue = 4 | pages = 471–500 | doi = 10.1177/0044118X82013004005 | date = June 1982 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Silbert"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Silbert | first1 = Mimi H. | last2 = Pines | first2 = Ayala M. | last3 = Lynch | first3 = Teri | author-link1 = Mimi Silbert | title = Sexual assault of prostitutes: phase one | publisher = Delancey Street Foundation, National Institute of Mental Health | location = Washington D.C. | series = Grant No. RO1-MH-32782-01 | year = 1980 | oclc = 45111118 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and that many young women and girls enter prostitution directly from state care in at least England, Norway, Australia and Canada.&lt;ref name="Coy"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Coy | first = Maddy | author-link = Maddy Coy | title = Young women, local authority care and selling sex: findings from research | journal = [[The British Journal of Social Work]] | volume = 38 | issue = 7 | pages = 1408–1424 | doi = 10.1093/bjsw/bcm049 | date = October 2008 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Regulated prostitution==
In some countries, (or administrative subdivisions within a country), prostitution is ''legal and regulated''. In these jurisdictions, there is a specific law, which explicitly allows the practice of prostitution if certain conditions are met (as opposed to places where prostitution is legal only because there is no law to prohibit it).

In countries where prostitution is regulated, the prostitutes may be registered, they may be hired by a brothel, they may organize trade unions, they may be covered by workers' protection laws, their proceeds may be taxable, they may be required to undergo regular health checks, etc. The degree of regulation, however, varies very much by jurisdiction.

Such approaches are taken with the stance that prostitution is impossible to eliminate, and thus these societies have chosen to regulate it in an attempt to increase [[transparency (behavior)|transparency]] and therefore reduce the more undesirable consequences.  Goals of such regulations include controlling [[sexually transmitted disease]], reducing sexual slavery, controlling where brothels may operate and dissociating prostitution from [[crime syndicate]]s.

In countries where prostitution is legal and regulated, it is usual for the practice to be restricted to particular areas.

In countries where prostitution itself is legal, but associated activities are outlawed, prostitution is generally ''not'' regulated.

===Mandatory health checks===
Not all countries with regulated prostitution require  mandatory health checks (because such checks are seen as too intrusive, a violation of human rights and a discriminatory policy, since the clients don't have to be subjected to them).{{cn|date=December 2017}}

A few jurisdictions, however, require that prostitutes undergo regular health checks for [[sexually transmitted disease]]s.

In [[Nevada]], state law requires that registered brothel prostitutes be checked weekly for several sexually transmitted diseases and monthly for HIV; furthermore, [[condom]]s are mandatory for all [[oral sex]] and [[sexual intercourse]]. Brothel owners may be held liable if customers become infected with HIV after a prostitute has tested positive for the virus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.leg.state.nv.us/nrs/NRS-041.html#NRS041Sec1397 |title=NRS 041.1397 |publisher=Leg.state.nv.us |accessdate=16 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prostitution outside the licensed brothels is illegal throughout the state; all forms of prostitution are illegal in [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]] (and [[Clark County, Nevada|Clark County]], which contains its metropolitan area), in [[Reno]] (and [[Washoe County, Nevada|Washoe County]]), in [[Carson City, Nevada|Carson City]], and in a few other parts of the state (currently 8 out of [[Nevada]]'s 16 counties have active brothels, see [[Prostitution in Nevada]]).

===Labour laws===

The regulation of prostitution is problematic because standard [[Labor laws|labor regulations]] cannot be applied to prostitution. The typical relation between employer and employee where the employer is in a position of authority over the employee is, in the case of prostitution, viewed by many as contrary to the physical integrity of the prostitute. It is forbidden to order a person to have sex on a given moment at a given place. Many sex operators also do not want to pay [[social security]] contributions, which comes with paid labor. Therefore, many prostitutes, in countries where prostitution is regulated, are officially listed as [[independent contractors]]. Sex operators typically operate as facilitators only and do not interfere with the prostitutes.

===Status of unregulated sex work===
The existence of regulated prostitution generally implies that prostitution is illegal outside of the regulated context. For example, Nevada has laws prohibiting the following: engagement in prostitution outside of licensed brothels, encouragement of others to become prostitutes, and living off the proceeds of a sex worker.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

Demands to legalise prostitution as a means to contain exploitation in the sex industry is now gaining support from organisations such as the UN and the Supreme Court of India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=K Rajasekharan|title=Legalise prostitution in India to address problems of sex industry|url=http://www.economylead.com/featured-news/legalise-prostitution-india-address-problems-sex-industry-13106|website=EconomyLead.com|publisher=EconomyLead.com|accessdate=30 December 2014|date=18 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Prostitution by region}}

Below there is a presentation of the legal status of prostitution around the world, as of May 2018

===Prohibitionism===

In these countries prostitution itself (exchanging sex for money) is illegal. The punishment for prostitution varies considerably: in some countries, it can incur the death penalty,&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; in other jurisdictions, it is a crime punishable with a prison sentence, while in others it is a lesser administrative offense punishable only with a fine.

===Abolitionism===

In these countries, there is no specific law prohibiting the exchange of sex for money, but in general most forms of [[Procuring (prostitution)|procuring]] (pimping) are illegal. These countries also generally have laws against soliciting in a public place (e.g., a street) or advertising prostitution, making it difficult to engage in prostitution without breaking any law. In countries like [[India]], though prostitution is legal, it is illegal when committed in a [[hotel]].&lt;ref name="indiankanoon.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://indiankanoon.org/doc/139656816/ |title=Section 7 in The Immoral Traffic (Prevention) Act, 1956 |publisher=Indiankanoon.org |date= |accessdate=2015-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legalization===

In some countries, prostitution is legal and regulated; although activities like pimping and street-walking are generally illegal. The degree of regulation varies by country; for example, not all countries require mandatory health checks because such checks are seen{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} as intrusive, a violation of human rights and discriminatory.

===Decriminalization===
The decriminalization of sex work is the removal of criminal penalties for sex work. Removing criminal prosecution for sex workers creates a safer and healthier environment&lt;ref name="Aziza" /&gt; and allows them to live with less social exclusion and stigma.&lt;ref name="canada" /&gt;

===Legality varies with local laws===

In these countries prostitution is permitted, prohibited or regulated by local laws rather than national laws. For example, in Mexico, prostitution is prohibited in some states but regulated in others.&lt;ref name="spl" /&gt;

==Enforcement==
The enforcement of the anti-prostitution laws varies from country to country or from region to region. In many places, there can be a discrepancy between the laws which exist on the books and what occurs in practice.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} For example, in [[Thailand]], prostitution is illegal, but in practice, it is tolerated and regulated. Such situations are common in many Asian countries.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}

In areas where prostitution or the associated activities are illegal, prostitutes are commonly charged with crimes ranging from minor infractions such as [[loitering]] to more serious crimes like [[tax evasion]]. Their clients can also be charged with [[solicitation]] of prostitution.

'''Rattlesnake round-ups''', also known as '''rattlesnake rodeos''', are annual events common in the rural [[Midwest]] and [[Southern United States|Southern]] [[United States]], where the primary attractions are captured wild [[rattlesnakes]] which are sold, displayed, killed for food or [[animal product]]s (such as [[snakeskin]]) or released back into the wild.  Rattlesnake round-ups originated in the first half of the 20th century for adventure and excitement, as well as to achieve local extirpation of perceived [[Pest (organism)|

Herpetological Conservation and Biology 4:132-141.&lt;/ref&gt; Typically a round-up will also include trade stalls, food, rides, and other features associated with [[fair]]s, as well as information on rattlesnake biology, identification, and safety.&lt;ref name=Noxen&gt;{{cite web|title=Noxen Rattlesnake Roundup|url=http://noxenpa.com/snakes.html|website=Noxen, Pa|accessdate=3 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Round-ups take place in at least ten states, with largest events in Texas and Oklahoma.&lt;ref name=Arena&gt;{{cite book|authors=Arena, Phillip C.|chapter=Rattlesnake Round-ups|editors=Knight, Richard L. &amp; Gutzwiller, Kevin J.|title=Wildlife and recreationists: coexistence through management and research|publisher=Island Press|year=1995|isbn=978-1-55963-257-7|pages=313–322|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Hg3kLAc1lCkC&amp;pg=PA318|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Fitzgerald&gt;Fitzgerald, L.

Wildlife Society Bulletin 28:235–253.&lt;/ref&gt; The largest rattlesnake round-up in the United States is held in [[Sweetwater, Texas]]. Held every year since 1958, the event currently attracts approximately 30,000 visitors per year and in 2006 each annual Round-Up was said to result in the capture of 1% of the state's rattlesnake population.&lt;ref name="CBS"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2006/03/11/ap/strange/mainD8G98IPG4.shtml|title=Texas Town Welcomes Rattlesnakes, Handlers|date=March 11, 2006|publisher=Associated Press|accessdate=2008-02-26|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060329083639/http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2006/03/11/ap/strange/mainD8G98IPG4.shtml|archivedate=2006-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Round-ups have economic and social importance to the communities that hold them.&lt;ref name=Means /&gt;&lt;ref name=Fitzgerald /&gt; The events often attract thousands of tourists, which can bring hundreds of thousands of dollars of revenue into small towns; the Sweetwater Round-Up's economic impact was estimated to exceed US$5 million in 2006.&lt;ref name="CBS"/&gt; Snake collectors often make large profits selling snakes at the events.

Cash prizes and trophies are often given out to participants in categories like heaviest, longest, or most snakes.&lt;ref name=Arena /&gt;&lt;ref name=Fitzgerald /&gt; These incentives result in all size classes of snakes being targeted equally.&lt;ref name=Arena /&gt; Most roundups target the [[western diamondback rattlesnake]] (''Crotalus atrox''), though some events target [[Crotalus viridis|prairie rattlesnakes]] (''C. viridis''), [[timber rattlesnake]]s (''C. horridus''), or the [[eastern diamondback rattlesnake]] (''C. adamanteus'').&lt;ref name=Arena /&gt;&lt;ref name=Fitch&gt;Fitch, H.S. 2003. Reproduction in the rattlesnakes of the Sharon Springs, Kansas Roundup. Kansas Journal of Herpetology 8: 23-24.&lt;/ref&gt;

A harvest of several hundred to several thousand kilograms of snakes is typical for many roundups. In Texas, up to 125,000 snakes could have been removed annually from the wild during the 1990s.&lt;ref name=Fitzgerald /&gt;  However, effects of roundups on rattlesnake populations are unclear. Harvest size at roundups is highly variable from year to year but does not show a consistent downward trend, even after decades of annual roundup events in some areas.&lt;ref name=Fitzgerald /&gt; ''C. atrox'' is listed as Least Concern by the [[IUCN]].&lt;ref name=Frost&gt;Frost, D.R., Hammerson, G.A. &amp; Santos-Barrera, G. 2007.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3476">'''Realization''', for [[Income tax in the United States|U.S. Federal income tax purposes]], is a requirement in determining what must be included as income subject to taxation. It should not be confused with the separate concept of [[Recognition (tax)]].

==Income==
Realization is a trigger for calculating income taxation. It is one of the three principles for defining income under the seminal case in this area of tax law, ''[[Commissioner v. Glenshaw Glass Co.]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|name=Commissioner v. Glenshaw Glass Co. |link=|volume=348|page=426|pin=|year=1955}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In that case, the Supreme Court determined that income generally means "undeniable accessions to wealth, clearly realized, and over which the taxpayers have complete dominion." It is also discussed in ''[[Helvering v. Bruun]],'' in which the court explains that "the realization of gain need not be in cash derived from the sale of an asset. Gain may occur as a result of exchange of property, payment of the taxpayer's indebtedness, relief from a liability, or other profit realized from the completion of a transaction."&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|name=Helvering v. Bruun|link=|volume=309|page=461|pin=|year=1940}}.&lt;/ref&gt; That is a checklist of types of realization triggers, but it is not exhaustive. Also, finding something of value can be a realization trigger, as the case of ''[[Cesarini v. United States]]'' demonstrates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Cesarini v. United States |vol=428 |reporter=F.2d |opinion=812 |pinpoint= |court= |date= |url=http://openjurist.org/428/f2d/812/cesarini-v-united-states |accessdate=2017-10-16 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Problems in line-drawing==
Realization is generally straightforward, but there are instances at the margins in which the moment of realization can be tricky. One example of a tricky realization situation that has given rise to substantial debate is the 62nd home run ball hit by [[Mark McGwire]]. The ball was retrieved by a grounds crewman, Tim Forneris. Forneris gave McGwire the ball immediately after the game amidspeculation that the ball could fetch at least $1 million in an auction. Do either McGwire or Forneris have gross income? Did Forneris realize income when he caught the ball? Tax professors typically teach that it would be income to Forneris when he caught it, because it is [[treasure trove]]. As a result, the person who catches a home run ball would generally be required to include the value of the ball in income in the year in which the catch took place, whether or not the person sold the ball and whether or not he gave it back to the player or the team. That is an unpopular result, and the [[Internal Revenue Service]] (IRS) issued [https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-news/ir-98-56.pdf Ruling 98-56] to change the result in the face of public pressure but only in the case in which the player returned the ball. Under that theory, an individual who catches a record-breaking ball has income at the very moment he possesses it unless he immediately disclaims possession by returning it. If he does not do that, the only remaining question is what value he ought to include in income. Because the treasure trove rule is that the value at the time the ball is "reduced to possession," the answer must be a reasonable estimate of its market value, whether or not the recipient sells the ball.

Within the [[civil law (common law)|civil law]] context,  sanctions are usually monetary fines, levied against a party to a [[lawsuit]] or his/her attorney, for violating rules of [[civil procedure|procedure]], or for abusing the [[judicial process]]. The most severe sanction in a civil lawsuit is the [[involuntary dismissal]], [[with prejudice]], of a complaining party's [[cause of action]], or of the responding party's answer. This has the effect of deciding the entire action against the sanctioned party without recourse, except to the degree that an [[appeal]] or [[trial de novo|trial ''de novo'']] may be allowed because of [[reversible error]].

As a noun, the term is usually used in the plural form, even if it only refers to a single event: if a [[judge]] fines a party, it is not said that he or she imposed a sanction, but that he or she imposed sanctions.

A judge may sanction a party during a legal proceeding, by which it is implied that he or she imposes penalties.  In the [[United States federal courts|United States federal court system]], certain types of conduct are sanctionable under Rule 11 of the [[Federal Rules of Civil Procedure]].

Conversely and sometimes confusingly, the word may be used to imply "approve of," especially in an official sense.  "The law sanctions such behavior" would imply that the behavior spoken of enjoys the specific approval of law.

To sanction implies make a legal agreement. The word is derived from sanctus, to make holy. A legal agreement or sanction imposes approvals, rules, guidelines and penalties on conduct.

The Sanction is defined as ''an element associated with an accountability and which corresponds to the consequence resulting from the justification of the realisation (or not) of this accountability.''.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite conference | author = Feltus C. | title = Aligning Access Rights to Governance Needs with the Responsibility MetaModel (ReMMo) in the Frame of Enterprise Architecture | date=2014 | url = http://dial.academielouvain.be/handle/boreal:144013 | format = PDF }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1966">In the former [[Soviet Union]], '''self-taxation''' ({{lang-ru|Самообложение}}, '''samooblozhenie''') was a form of collecting various resources (money, food, etc.) in [[rural area]]s for local needs. Described as voluntary, it was established at a common meeting of the residents of an administrative unit (settlement or [[selsoviet]]). The common annual rate was set over the unit, with the rate for independent farmers had to be at least 25% higher than for [[kolkhoz]]niks, [[sovkhoz]]niks, and factory and state workers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bse.sci-lib.com/article099234.html "Samooblozhenie"]&lt;/ref&gt; It was regulated by several  joint decrees of the [[Central Executive Committee of the Soviet Union|Central Executive Committee]] and [[Sovnarkom]] of the [[Soviet Union]] with the same title, "On the Self-Taxation of Rural Population" ("О самообложении сельского населения") dated by August 16, 1930, August 1, 1931&lt;ref&gt;[http://ppt.ru/newstext.phtml?id=38660 "Постановление ЦИК СССР N 12, СНК СССР N 632 от 03.08.1931]&lt;/ref&gt; and September 11, 1937.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ppt.ru/news/68869 "81 год назад было регламентировано самообложение сельского населения"], 3 августа 2012 (retrieved May 17, 2016)&lt;/ref&gt; and later by other central governmental organs, such as Presidium Supreme Soviet (1984)&lt;ref&gt;[http://ppt.ru/newstext.phtml?id=16593 ПРЕЗИДИУМ ВЕРХОВНОГО СОВЕТА РСФСР УКАЗ от 12 января 1984 года О САМООБЛОЖЕНИИ СЕЛЬСКОГО НАСЕЛЕНИЯ]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="909">The '''Severin doctrine''' (Severin v. [[United States Court of Claims]], 1943. 99 Ct.Cl. 435) states that a [[general contractor]] cannot sue an owner on behalf of one of its [[subcontractor]]s to recover monies due to the subcontractor unless the general contractor is itself liable to the subcontractor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=April 2003  |title=Catwalk leaves scratch marks|journal=Roads and Bridges |volume=41|issue=4|url=http://www.roadsbridges.com/Catwalk-leaves-scratch-marks-article4013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Spanish Constitution of 1931''' was approved by the [[Constituent Cortes|Constituent Assembly]] on 9 December 1931. It was the constitution of the [[Second Spanish Republic]] (founded 14 April 1931) and was in force until 1 April 1939. This was the second period of [[History of Spain|Spanish history]] in which both [[head of state]] and [[head of government]] were democratically [[election|elected]].

A constitutional draft prepared by a commission under a reformist Catholic lawyer [[Ángel Ossorio y Gallardo]] having been rejected, an amended draft was approved by the Constituent Assembly on 9 December 1931. It created a secular democratic system based on equal rights for all citizens, with provision for regional autonomy. It introduced [[Women's suffrage|female suffrage]], civil marriage  and divorce. It permitted the state to expropriate private property, with compensation, for reasons of broader social utility. It also established free, obligatory, secular education for all and dissolved the Jesuits.

The Republic "was the culmination of a process of mass mobilisation and opposition to the old politics of notables."&lt;ref&gt;Francisco J.Romero Salvado, Politics and Society in Spain 1898-1998 p.69&lt;/ref&gt; According to the historian Mary Vincent the Constitution envisaged "a reforming regime with an explicit and self-conscious view of what modernising Spain should entail. A secular state operating according to the rule of law with an admittedly ill-defined sense of social justice would open the way for an educated body of citizens to enjoy 'European' prosperity and freedom."&lt;ref&gt;Mary Vincent, University of Sheffield, review of Romero's Politics and Society in Spain 1898-1998 , 'Reviews in History' April 2000&lt;/ref&gt; According to Frances Lannon however, the articles on property and religion, with their exaltation of state power and disregard for civil rights, "virtually destroyed any prospect there had been for the development of a Catholic, conservative, Republicanism."&lt;ref name="SCW"&gt;Frances Lannon, p.20  the Spanish Civil War, 1936-1939 {{ISBN|978-1-84176-369-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The constitution was criticized by the most religious sectors of the population as anticlerical or oppressive regarding the rights of Roman Catholics. {{clarify|date=January 2016}}. However, the Constitution broadly accorded civil liberties. Commentators{{who|date=April 2016}} have noted that the strain of church-state relations was a significant cause of the breakdown of the republic and of the [[Spanish Civil War]].

==Background==
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 102-11543, Madrid, Ausrufung der Zweiten Spanischen Republik.jpg|thumb|Proclamation of the Second Spanish Republic on 14 April 1931 in Barcelona.]]

The Second Republic began on 14 April 1931 after the departure from Spain of King [[Alfonso XIII of Spain|Alfonso XIII]], following local and municipal elections in which republican candidates won the majority of votes in [[urban area|urban]] areas.  Though Alfonso did not formally abdicate, his departure from the country led to a [[provisional government]] under [[Niceto Alcalá Zamora]], and a [[constituent Cortes]] drew up a new [[constitution]].

The Second Republic in 1931 brought enormous hopes for Spanish [[workers]] and peasants, and in social terms some advances were made, especially for women{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}.  Prime Minister [[Manuel Azaña]] asserted that the Catholic Church was responsible in part for what many perceived as Spain's backwardness and advocated the elimination of special privileges for the Church.  Azaña wanted the Second Spanish Republic to emulate the pre-1914 [[Third French Republic]], make secular schooling free and compulsory, and construct a non-religious basis for national culture and citizenship.&lt;ref&gt;Lannon, The Spanish Civil War 1936-1939 , Osprey 2002 p.18 {{ISBN|978-1-84176-369-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Provisions==
[[File:Franchise postale.jpg|thumb|150px|Commemorative stamp]] 
Following elections in June 1931 the new parliament approved an amended constitutional draft on 9 December 1931.

The constitution introduced female suffrage, civil marriage and divorce.&lt;ref name= "britannica"&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/27867/anticlericalism/337/Spain Anticlericalism] Britannica Online Encyclopedia&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Torres Gutiérrez, Alejandro ,[http://www.cesnur.org/2002/slc/torres.htm RELIGIOUS MINORITIES IN SPAIN. A NEW MODEL OF RELATIONSHIPS?] Center for Study on New Religions 2002&lt;/ref&gt;  It also established free, obligatory, secular education for all.  However, some laws nationalized Roman Catholic Church properties and required the Roman Catholic Church to pay rent for the use of properties which it had previously owned.  In addition, the government forbade public manifestations of Catholicism such as processions on religious feast days, dissolved the [[Jesuits]] and banned Catholic education by prohibiting the religious communities of nuns, priests and brothers from teaching even in private schools.
The constitution also made the right to property subject to the public good, such that it could be [[Nationalization|nationalized]] as long as the owner was compensated.&lt;ref name="Historical Dictionary of Spain"/&gt;

The constitution granted freedom of religion to all, including non-catholic worship in Spain.&lt;ref&gt;''Art. 27.- La libertad de conciencia y el derecho de profesar y prácticar libremente cualquier religión quedan garantizados en el territorio español, salvo el respeto debido a las exigencias de la moral pública. 
Los cementerios estarán sometidos a la jurisdicción civil. No podrá haber en ellos separación de recintos por motivos religiosos. 
Todas las confesiones podrán ejercer sus cultos privadamente. Las manifestaciones públicas del culto habrán de ser, en cada caso, autorizadas por el Gobierno. 
Nadie podrá ser compelido a declarar oficialmente sus creencias religiosas. 
La condición religiosa no constituirá circunstancia modificativa de la personalidad civil ni política, salvo lo dispuesto en esta Constitución para el nombramiento de Presidente de la República y para ser Presidente del Consejo de Ministros.
Fuero de los españoles (1945'')&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Political aspects ===
{{unref|section|date=December 2017}}
Head of State was the President of the Republic, who was elected by an [[Electoral college|Electoral College]] composed of members of legislative branch and elector citizens called compromisaries (''compromisarios)'' elected by popular vote.

Legislature was in charge of a unicameral assembly, the General Courts (''[[Cortes Generales]]''), composed by members elected by popular vote for 4 years term. Popular initiative of law could be made at request of 15 percent of the country citizens, with restrictions on the subjects to be presented.

Executive branch was exercised by a Prime Minister (''[[Prime Minister of Spain|Presidente del Gobierno]]''), appointed by the President of the Republic and General Courts, and a cabinet of ministers.

It was established a Court of Constitutional Guarantees (''Tribunal de Garantías Constitucionales''), whose work was guarding the constitutionality of laws and settling disputes between state powers.

It established the territorial division in provinces, and the possibility that those that had common cultural characteristics could be united to obtain the territorial autonomy as unified region through an Autonomy Statute ([[Statute of Autonomy|''Estatuto de Autonomía)'']].

===Disestablishment of the privileges of the Roman Catholic Church===

Although the constitution generally accorded thorough civil liberties and representation, there was a notable exclusion regarding the privileges of the Catholic Church, which some regarded as crucial to prevent the forming of an expansive democratic majority.&lt;ref name="libro.uca.edu"&gt;[http://libro.uca.edu/payne2/payne25.htm Payne, Stanley G.  ''A History of Spain and Portugal'', Vol. 2, Ch. 25, p. 632 (Print Edition: University of Wisconsin Press, 1973) (LIBRARY OF IBERIAN RESOURCES ONLINE Accessed May 30, 2007)]&lt;/ref&gt;

The controversial articles 26 and 27 of the constitution strictly controlled Church property and prohibited religious orders from engaging in education.&lt;ref name="Historical Dictionary of Spain"&gt;Smith, Angel, [https://books.google.com/books?id=IFuxO9NO-voC&amp;dqHistorical Dictionary of Spain], p. 195, Rowman &amp; Littlefield 2008&lt;/ref&gt; This was seen as explicitly hostile to Roman Catholicism, both by supporters of the established Church, but also by advocates of church/state separation. One such advocate of separation, [[José Ortega y Gasset]], stated "the article in which the Constitution legislates the actions of the Church seems highly improper to me."&lt;ref&gt;Paz, Jose Antonio Souto [http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3736/is_200101/ai_n8951721/pg_4 Perspectives on religious freedom in Spain] Brigham Young University Law Review January 1, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Pope Pius XI]] condemned the Spanish Government's deprivation of the privileges of Catholics in the [[encyclical]] [[Dilectissima Nobis]] (On Oppression Of The Church Of Spain )."&lt;ref&gt;Dilectissima Nobis,  2&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 1931 [[José María Gil-Robles y Quiñones|José María Gil-Robles]] the leading spokesman of the parliamentary right declared that the constitution was 'stillborn' - a 'dictatorial Constitution in the name of democracy.' Robles  wanted to use mass meetings "to give supporters of the right a sense of their own strength and, ominously, to accustom them 'to fight, when necessary, for the possession of the street.'"&lt;ref&gt;Gil-Robles, No fue posible la paz, quoted in Mary Vincent Catholicism in the Second Spanish republic, p.182&lt;/ref&gt;

The conservative Catholic Republicans Alcalá-Zamora and [[Miguel Maura]] resigned from the government&lt;ref name="SCW"/&gt; when the controversial articles 26 and 27 of the constitution, which strictly controlled Church property and prohibited religious orders from engaging in education were passed.&lt;ref name="Historical Dictionary of Spain"/&gt;

[[Frances Lannon]] calls the constitution "divisive" in that the articles on property and religion,  prioritizing state power, had a "disregard for civil rights" and ruined the prospect of the development of a Catholic, conservative, Republicanism.&lt;ref name="SCW"/&gt; Likewise, [[Stanley Payne]] agrees that the constitution generally accorded a wide range of civil liberties and representation with the notable exception of the rights of Catholics, a circumstance which prevented the formation of an expansive democratic majority.&lt;ref name="libro.uca.edu"/&gt;

Since the far left considered reform of these aspects of the constitution as totally unacceptable, commentators have opined that "the Republic as a democratic constitutional regime was doomed from the outset".&lt;ref name="libro.uca.edu"/&gt;  Commentators have posited that such a [[Separation of church and state#Friendly and hostile separation|"hostile" approach to the issues of church and state]] were a substantial cause of the breakdown of democracy and the onset of [[Spanish Civil War|civil war]].&lt;ref&gt;Stepan, Alfred,[https://books.google.com/books?id=nR2tF4k1PXUC&amp;dq Arguing Comparative Politics], p. 221, Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt; One legal commentator emphasized that "the gravest mistake of the Constitution of 1931-Spain's last democratic Constitution prior to 1978-was its hostile attitude towards the Catholic Church."&lt;ref&gt;Martinez-Torron, Javier [http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3736/is_200101/ai_n8950497/pg_2 Freedom of religion in the case law of the Spanish Constitutional court] Brigham Young University Law Review 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

===Liberties for religious minorities===
The Spanish Constitution of 1931 attempted to secure religious liberty for religious organizations other than Roman Catholics, halting discrimination and persecution of Jews and Protestants.&lt;ref&gt;Isidro González García, Los judíos y la Segunda República, 1931-1939&lt;/ref&gt; However, this freedom would be curbed by the Franco's dictatorial regime that granted the Roman Catholic Church the status of official religion of Spain and prohibited other public religious manifestations.&lt;ref&gt;Fuero de los españoles (1945)
Art. 6.- La profesión y práctica de la Religión Católica, que es la del Estado español, gozará de la protección oficial. 
Nadie será molestado por sus creencias religiosas ni el ejercicio privado de su culto. No se permitirán otras ceremonias ni manifestaciones externas que las de la Religión Católica.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Wendy Sewell.jpg|thumb|The murder victim Wendy Sewell was bludgeoned to death in the graveyard where Stephen Downing worked|alt=h]]

The '''Stephen Downing case''' involved the conviction and imprisonment in 1974 of a 17-year-old council worker, Stephen Downing, for the murder of a 32-year-old legal secretary, Wendy Sewell, in the [[Market town|town]] of [[Bakewell]] in the [[Peak District]] in [[Derbyshire]], central England. 

Following a campaign by a local newspaper, his conviction was overturned in 2002, after Downing had served 27 years in prison. The case is thought to be the longest [[miscarriage of justice]] in British legal history,&lt;ref name="NewStatesman"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.newstatesman.com | work=New Statesman | title=The editor, the murder and the truth}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/1760754.stm] BBC News 15 January 2002 ''Downing murder conviction quashed''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.richardwebster.net/thenewinjustices.html|title=The new injustices:from false confessions to false allegations|first=Richard|last=Webster|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and attracted worldwide media attention.

==History==

===Assault===
Wendy Sewell was attacked, in Bakewell Cemetery, at lunchtime on 12 September 1973. A witness, Charles Carman, saw her enter the cemetery at about 12:50 pm. She was beaten  around the head with the handle of a pickaxe&lt;ref name=bbc-still-suspect&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/2804197.stm | work=BBC News | title=Still a suspect after 30 years | date=27 February 2003 | accessdate=24 May 2010 | first=Peter | last=Gould}}&lt;/ref&gt; and sexually assaulted,&lt;ref name="NewStatesman"/&gt; with her trousers, [[Underpants|pants]], [[Plimsoll shoe|plimsolls]] and parts of her bra removed.&lt;ref name="Report"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.docstoc.com/docs/25878687/Operation-Noble-Re-investigation-into-the-murder-of-Wendy-Sewell|work=Derbyshire Police|title=OPERATION NOBLE: The Police Reinvestigation of the Murder of Wendy Sewell in Bakewell, September 1973}}&lt;/ref&gt; She died from her injuries in [[Chesterfield Royal Hospital]] two days later.

===Trial===
The 17-year-old cemetery groundskeeper, Stephen Downing, was the primary suspect. He told police that he had found Sewell lying on the ground, covered in blood, and that her blood got on his clothes because she shook her head.&lt;ref name="NewStatesman"/&gt; Despite having learning difficulties and a reading age of 11, he was arrested, questioned for nine hours without a solicitor present, and signed a confession.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.innocent.org.uk/cases/stephendowning/index.html|title=INNOCENT – Fighting miscarriages of justice&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080905082523/http://www.innocent.org.uk/cases/stephendowning/index.html|archivedate=5 September 2008|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Downing's trial took place between 13 and 15 February 1974 at the [[Nottingham Crown Court|Crown Court at Nottingham]] before Mr Justice Nield and a jury where he pleaded not guilty. A forensic scientist Norman Lee, gave evidence that the blood found on the accused could only have been present if he had been responsible for the assault. Lee described this evidence as "a textbook example ... which might be expected on the clothing of the assailant". No full transcript of the trial exists, but it is known that, in summing up, the judge drew attention to Downing’s admission during the trial of having indecently assaulted Sewell as she lay injured in the cemetery (he later denied that he made those admissions during the trial).

By a unanimous verdict, the jury found Downing guilty of murder, and he was sentenced to be indefinitely detained [[at Her Majesty's pleasure]], with a stipulation that he should serve a minimum of ten years.

Caught in an [[innocent prisoner's dilemma]], Downing was unable to be paroled, as he did not admit to the crime. He was classified as "In Denial of Murder" and therefore ineligible for [[parole]] under English law.

===The first appeal===
A witness was found who said she saw Downing leaving the cemetery, and at that time she also saw Wendy Sewell alive and unharmed. Downing applied for leave to appeal on the grounds he had a new witness.

On 25 October 1974, the [[Court of Appeal]] heard the grounds for appeal and reached the conclusion that the witness' evidence of seeing Wendy Sewell walking towards the back of the consecrated chapel was unreliable due to some fully grown trees obstructing her line of sight. The court felt that her evidence was not credible and secure enough to allow an appeal against the conviction.

During the Derbyshire Police's re-investigation in 2002, this witness was re-interviewed and accompanied back to the cemetery location. She reaffirmed that the fully grown trees, which have since been felled, would have obstructed her line of sight. She also revealed the knowledge that she is, and was at the time, short sighted. The witness, who was 15 years old at the time of the murder, was unable to give an adequate reason for why she came forward with her original evidence.&lt;ref name="Report"/&gt;

===Campaign===
Stephen Downing continued to deny committing the murder so his family attempted to get support for another retrial. In 1994, they wrote to the local newspaper, the ''[[Matlock Mercury]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/1158058.stm|title=BBC News - UK - Don Hale: Campaigning editor|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The editor, [[Don Hale]], took up the case and along with Downing's family ran a campaign.

As a result of this campaign along with Downing's continual protestations of innocence, the case was referred to the Criminal Cases Review Commission in 1997.

Downing was released on appeal in 2001 after 27 years in prison. The following year, 2002, the [[Court of Appeal]] overturned Downing's conviction, finding it to be unsafe.

The case is thought to be the longest miscarriage of justice in British legal history, and attracted worldwide media attention.

===The second appeal===
During the second appeal, held on 15 January 2002, the [[Court of Appeal]] accepted many of the reasons that were put forward by Hale and others for believing the conviction was unsafe. Julian Bevan, counsel for the Crown, accepted two arguments put forward by the defence. The first was that Downing's confession should not have been allowed to go before a jury. The confession was unsafe because Downing had been questioned for eight hours, during which the police shook him and pulled his hair to keep him awake; because he wasn't formally cautioned that what he said may be used in evidence against him; and because he wasn't given a solicitor. The Crown also agreed with the defence argument that more recent knowledge of blood-splattering patterns meant the prosecution's claim that the blood could only have been found on the clothes of the attacker was questionable.

[[The Rt Hon. Lord Justice Pill]] said that the Court of Appeal did not have to consider whether Downing had proved that he was innocent, but whether the original conviction was fair – "''The question for [the Court of Appeal’s] consideration is whether the conviction is safe and not whether the accused is guilty''". What the defence had proved was that there was reasonable doubt about the "reliability of the confessions made in 1973". His Lordship said: "The court cannot be sure the confessions are reliable. It follows that the conviction is unsafe. The conviction is quashed."&lt;ref name="Report"/&gt;

==Police reinvestigation==
Following the Court of Appeal overturning Stephen Downing's conviction, the [[Derbyshire]] Police reinvestigated the murder under the name Operation Noble. During 2002, they interviewed 1,600 witnesses, at an estimated cost of £500,000 – though Downing himself refused to be reinterviewed. A year after the conviction was overturned, in February 2003, Derbyshire police revealed the findings of their reinvestigation of the murder. There were 22 other possible suspects, many of whom had been suggested by Don Hale during his campaign, and in his book ''Town Without Pity''. All were cleared of any possibility of having murdered Wendy Sewell. 

After failing to link any other person with the murder, and unable to eliminate Downing as the suspect, they declared the case closed. Even though Downing remained the prime suspect, under the "[[double jeopardy]]" rule the police did not submit the results of their inquiries to the [[Crown Prosecution Service]], as he cannot be re-arrested and charged with the same crime without new evidence.

In January 2014, a former detective investigating 16 unsolved murders and possible links to the Yorkshire Ripper, obtained a pathology report which he claimed was buried by the police in 1973 within a few days of the attack on Wendy Sewell. He said it would have completely contradicted the so-called confession, exonerated Downing and prevented a miscarriage of justice. This new evidence sparked a new submission to the Home Secretary claiming that Derbyshire Police's investigations in 1973 had been potentially biased and unsatisfactory. 

The report called on Derbyshire Police to apologise and explain their actions which had been highlighted at appeal in 2002 as 'substantially and significantly breaching the judges' rules.' They were asked to explain this recent finding and confirm why crucial evidence had been deliberately kept from the defence. Campaigning editor, Don Hale had been told by police that all the evidence had been "burnt, lost and destroyed". When the murder weapon, a pickaxe handle was found to be on display at Derby Museum it was subjected to a modern forensic examination. Mr Downing's fingerprints were not found although there was a bloody palm print from an as yet unidentified person.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-derbyshire-38581779|title=Don Hale: One man's fight for justice|last=Wade|first=Dave|date=2017-01-26|newspaper=BBC News|access-date=2017-02-08|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Stephen Downing==
Stephen Downing was born in 1956 {{Citation needed|reason=This page is currently filed under 1957 births.|date=October 2017}}. He worked for the local council as a gardener in the Bakewell cemetery where Wendy Sewell was murdered. He was 17 years old, with a reading age of an 11-year-old, when he was tried and found guilty of the murder of Sewell. He served 27 years in jail. He had to change prison eight times due to being assaulted by fellow prisoners as a sex offender.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/stephen-downing-says-he-didnt-do-it-nobody-listened-now-after-27-years-in-jail-he-may-be-cleared-of-murder-622184.html | title=Stephen Downing says he didn't do it.

Downing's release was reported in the [[BBC]] as being hailed as 'a triumph for campaigning journalism... and an end to one of the worst miscarriages of justice in English legal history.' Downing was reported as receiving celebrity treatment upon his release. He initially found employment as a trainee chef in a Bakewell restaurant, using the training he had been given whilst in prison.&lt;ref name=bbc-still-suspect /&gt; He received compensation of £750,000 because he was not informed he was under arrest nor that he had the right to a solicitor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-410759/500-000-payout-Bakewell-Tart-murder-suspect.html | location=London | work=Daily Mail | title=£500,000 payout for 'Bakewell Tart' murder suspect | date=16 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; He received the money in two payments – an interim payment of £250,000 followed by a final payment of £500,000.

{{Constitutional history of Canada}}
The '''''Succession to the Throne Act''''' (1 Geo. VI, c.16) (the ''Act'') is the [[Act of Parliament|act]] of the [[Parliament of Canada|Canadian parliament]] that ratified [[Cabinet of Canada|the Cabinet]]'s consent to [[His Majesty's Declaration of Abdication Act 1936]], an act of the United Kingdom parliament that allowed [[Edward VIII]] to abdicate as [[Monarchy of Canada|king of Canada]], the [[United Kingdom]], and the other [[Dominion]]s and pass the throne to [[George VI]]. However, it was the [[Government of Canada|Canadian government]]'s request and consent, and not the ''Succession to the Throne Act'', that gave the British Act of Parliament effect in and made it part of the law of Canada, as per section 4 of the [[Statute of Westminster 1931]], which allowed the British parliament to legislate for the Dominions only with their agreement.

==Background==
[[Edward VIII abdication crisis|Edward VIII abdicated]] in order to marry [[Wallis Simpson]] after facing opposition from the governments of the United Kingdom and the Dominions, including Canada. Although the King had signed instruments of abdication on December 10, sending notice of this by cable (and later one of the instruments by mail, both signed by him) to the [[Governor General of Canada]] ([[John Buchan, 1st Baron Tweedsmuir|the Lord Tweedsmuir]]),&lt;ref name=CPR&gt;{{cite journal| last=Toffoli| first=Gary|author2=Benoit, Paul | title=More is Needed to Change the Rules of Succession for Canada| journal=Canadian Parliamentary Review| volume=36| issue=Summer 2013| page=10| publisher=Parliament of Canada| location=Ottawa| url=http://www.revparl.ca/36/2/36n2_13e_print.pdf| issn=0229-2548| accessdate=July 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; he was still king until [[Royal Assent]] was granted to ''His Majesty's Declaration of Abdication Act 1936'', which was passed through the British Houses of Parliament in one day, with no amendments. The Canadian government (along with those of Australia, South Africa, and New Zealand) requested and gave its consent, via [[Order in Council]],&lt;ref name=CPR /&gt; to the act becoming law in Canada,&lt;ref name=Twomey&gt;{{cite AV media| people=[[Anne Twomey]]| title=Professor Anne Twomey - Succession to the Crown: foiled by Canada?| medium=Digital video| publisher=University College London| location=London| date=18 September 2014| url=http://vimeo.com/108335929}}&lt;/ref&gt; under the terms of the [[Statute of Westminster 1931]], which stipulated that the British parliament could pass legislation for any Dominion only at the request and with the approval of that Dominion's government. The King then issued an Order [[Queen-in-Council|in his British Council]] to authorize the inclusion of the Dominions in the ''Abdication Act''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://century.guardian.co.uk/1930-1939/Story/0,6051,127047,00.html King Edward renounces the throne], ''The Guardian'', December 1936&lt;/ref&gt; The South African parliament later passed its own law, ''[[His Majesty King Edward the Eighth's Abdication Act, 1937]]'', recognizing George VI's accession as [[Monarchy of South Africa|king of South Africa]] as being on December 10, 1936, while the legislature of the [[Irish Free State]] also passed a backdated law, the ''[[Executive Authority (External Relations) Act 1936|External Relations Act]]'', on December 12, 1936.

==Canadian law==
The ''Act'' ratified the changes to the rules of succession in Canada and assured consistency with the changes in the rules then in place in the United Kingdom and the other Dominions. The ''Act'' was not legally required at the time, as the Canadian government's request and consent to ''His Majesty's Declaration of Abdication Act 1936'' had already made it part of Canada's law&lt;ref name=Twomey/&gt; and the Governor General had already proclaimed the Duke of York as King George VI. (Indeed, Royal Assent to the bill was granted in the name of George VI.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media| people=Various| title=In Committee from the Senate: Legal and Constitutional Affairs - March 20, 2013| medium=Digital video| publisher=CPAC| location=Ottawa| date=20 March 2013| url=http://www.cpac.ca/en/digital-archives/?search=succession%20throne&amp;orderby=relevance| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150413142423/http://www.cpac.ca/en/digital-archives/?search=succession%20throne&amp;orderby=relevance| archivedate=13 April 2015| df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;) However, constitutional experts noted that "Whether necessary or not, it was clearly designed to demonstrate Canada's equality with Britain in the British Commonwealth and to display the Canadian aspect of the monarchy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.sfu.ca/~aheard/324/Independence.html| last=Herald| first=Andrew| title=Canadian Independence| date=1990| publisher=Simon Fraser University| accessdate=July 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under present Canadian law, the Canadian government cannot request and consent to any British act becoming part of Canadian law, as the ''[[Canada Act, 1982]]'', ended all remaining authority of the UK parliament to legislate for Canada, both by the ''Act'''s own terms and through enactment of the ''[[Constitution Act, 1982]]'' (whose schedule repealed section 4 of the Statute of Westminster 1931 in Canada).&lt;ref name=Twomey/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2746">'''Suicide bidding''' is a response to a [[tendering]] exercise in which a potential supplier, anxious to win business, submits a proposal to carry out the work for less than it will cost.

The motive for such bidding is to keep the company's [[skilled labour]] employed, even if the project only [[break-even|breaks even]] or makes a loss.&lt;ref name=CIOB&gt;{{cite book|title=Procurement in the Construction Industry|publisher=[[Chartered Institute of Building]]|date=December 2010|accessdate=3 June 2011|page=3, 12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This can result in poor quality work, poor service and debates over [[loophole]]s in [[contract]] wording in attempts to charge clients extra,&lt;ref name=brown/&gt; or even insolvency on the part of the contractor.&lt;ref name=prior/&gt;

The practice has particularly been noted in [[construction bidding]]. A 2010 survey by the [[Chartered Institute of Building]] found that 82% of respondents
believe that “suicide bidding” exists within the industry.&lt;ref name=CIOB/&gt; It was considered to have contributed to the financial collapse of British firms [[Connaught plc]] and [[Rok plc]] in 2010.&lt;ref name=brown&gt;{{cite web|last=Brown|first=Carl|title=Landlords crack down on ‘suicide-bidding’|url=http://www.insidehousing.co.uk/finance/landlords-crack-down-on-%E2%80%98suicide-bidding%E2%80%99/6515756.article|work=Inside Housing|accessdate=2011-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Civil Engineering]] Contractors Association acknowledged that the practice had become "rife" in the desperate competition for work during the [[late-2000s recession]], but blamed the [[government procurement|public sector procurement]] process for focussing on the lowest price rather than [[best value]].&lt;ref name=prior&gt;{{cite news|last=Prior|first=Grant|title=Government urged to stamp out suicide bidding|url=http://www.constructionenquirer.com/2011/04/28/government-urged-to-stamp-out-suicide-bidding/|accessdate=31 May 2011|newspaper=Construction Enquirer|date=28 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some commissioning bodies, such as [[Crossrail]], openly discourage the practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lane|first=Michael|title=Crossrail discourages suicide bidding|url=http://www.cnplus.co.uk/technical/crossrail/crossrail-discourages-suicide-bidding/5211064.article|work=Construction News|accessdate=2011-05-31|date=19 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, some [[housing association]]s began including specific [[contractual terms|terms]] in tenders to protect them from legal challenge in the event of refusing to award the contract according to the lowest tender.&lt;ref name=brown/&gt;

{{Politics of Brazil}}
The '''Superior Electoral Court''' ({{lang-pt|Tribunal Superior Eleitoral}}, '''TSE''') is the highest body of the [[Brazil]]ian Electoral Justice, which also comprises one [[Regional Electoral Court (Brazil)|Regional Electoral Court]] ({{lang-pt|Tribunal Regional Eleitoral}}, TRE) in each of the 26 states and the Federal District of the country, as determined by Article 118 of the [[Constitution of Brazil]].

==Background and legal provisions==

The Brazilian Electoral Code of 1932 established the Electoral Justice in Brazil, replacing the political system conducted by the Legislative branch over the electoral proceedings.&lt;ref&gt;SILVA, José Afonso da. Curso de Direito Constitucional Positivo. 33ª Ed. São Paulo: Malheiros, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The new judicial system transferred control over such proceedings to the Judiciary. In the present, duties of the Electoral Justice are regulated by a posterior Electoral Code, approved in 1965 (Law No. 4.737/65),&lt;ref&gt;MARTINS, Flavia Bahia. Direito constitucional. 2ª Ed. Niterói: Impetus, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; which revoked the 1932 code, but kept the judicial control over the electoral proceedings. 

The Superior Electoral Court is the highest judicial body of the Brazilian Electoral Justice as per Article 121, §3 of the Brazilian Constitution of 1988, which sets that the decisions of the Superior Electoral Court are unappealable, except those contrary to the Constitution, or that deny [[habeas corpus]] or [[writs of mandamus]]. Therefore, in such exceptions, the [[Supreme Federal Court]] judges appeals filed against the Superior Electoral Court’s rulings. 

The composition of the court is ruled by Article 119 of the [[Constitution of Brazil]], which sets that the court shall be composed by seven members. Three of them shall be elected by secret vote from among the Justices of the Supreme Federal Court and two other judges shall be elected by secret vote from among the Justices of the Superior Court of Justice. The remaining two shall be appointed by the [[President of Brazil]] from among six lawyers of notable juridical knowledge and good moral reputation nominated by the [[Supreme Federal Court]].

It implements [[EU Directive]] No. 89/104/EEC (The [[Trade Marks Directive]]) which forms the framework for the [[trade mark]] laws of all [[EU member states]], and replaced an earlier law, the Trade Marks Act 1938.&lt;ref name="LSgaz"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jones|first=Stephen|last2=Smith|first2=Robert|date=27 March 1991|title=Putting trade mark law in touch with commerce|url=|journal=Law Society Guardian Gazette|volume=88|issue=12|pages=|via=Lexis}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the UK's trade mark regime covers the Isle of Man, it does not extend to the [[Channel Islands]] which have their own trade mark registers.

The Act provides both civil and criminal law sanctions for the misuse of registered trade marks. 
Section 93 of the Act makes enforcement of the criminal sanctions the duty of the local [[Weights and Measures]] Authority (usually the [[Trading Standards]] department) and imports enforcement powers from the [[Trade Descriptions Act]].  

Similar criminal law provisions are written into the related [[Copyright Designs and Patents Act]].

The [[UK Patent Office]], which deals with trade mark registration, has recently implemented a national intelligence database, TellPat, which is available to enforcement officers.

== Changes from 1938 Act ==
The introduction of new primary legislation for trade marks in 1994 enabled the government to make a number of changes beyond merely implementing the EU Directive. These include:&lt;ref name="LSgaz" /&gt;

* Removing the two-part registration system: under the 1938 Act, trademarks were registered into two distinct parts (Part A and B) with different distinctiveness requirements.
* Allowing applications to multiple classes.
* Ensuring the registration requirements for goods and services are as similar as possible.

The Act also provides for a defence of "honest" use of a natural name.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mosawi|first=Anthony|date=24 March 1995|title=The fire line between trade marks|url=|journal=New Law Journal|volume=145|issue=6688|pages=410|via=Lexis}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Youngberg v. Romeo''''', 457 U.S. 307 (1982), was a [[landmark decision|landmark]] [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] case regarding the rights of the [[Involuntary commitment|involuntarily committed]] and those with [[intellectual disabilities]]. Nicholas Romeo had an intellectual disability with an infant level [[IQ]] and was committed to a Pennsylvania state hospital.  He was restrained for many hours of the day and repeatedly injured.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.oyez.org/cases/1980-1989/1981/1981_80_1429/ Oyez: Youngberg v. Romeo, 457 U.S. 307 (1982), U.S. Supreme Court Case Summary &amp; Oral Argument&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The Supreme Court agreed with the [[Third Circuit Court of Appeals]] that involuntarily committed residents had the right to reasonably safe confinement conditions, no unreasonable body restraints and the habilitation they reasonably require.  

==Background==
The defendants, who were management personnel at [[Pennhurst State School]], an old state facility to which Romeo’s mother had him committed when she could no longer care for him, did not dispute Romeo’s right to care, habilitation, training and security.  The critical issue in the case was the standard of care and whether the defendants had violated that standard, and therefore, Romeo’s federally protected civil rights.  The federal courts had not yet addressed this question in the context of intellectual disability.  The trial court therefore looked to a then-recent Supreme Court decision holding that deliberate indifference to serious medical needs of prisoners constitutes “unnecessary and wanton infliction of pain” in violation of the 8th Amendment.  The jury found for the defendants.  The 3rd Circuit reversed and ordered a new trial, explaining that the standard of care should have been based on the 14th rather than the 8th Amendment and the Supreme Court agreed.  However, the high court rejected the circuit court’s articulation of the standard of care.  

==Opinion of the Court==
The syllabus summarizes the court's holding:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
“Respondent [Romeo] has constitutionally protected liberty interests under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to reasonably safe conditions of confinement, freedom from unreasonable bodily restraints, and such minimally adequate training as reasonably may be required by these interests.  Whether [his] constitutional rights have been violated must be determined by balancing these liberty interests against the relevant state interests.  The proper standard for determining whether the State has adequately protected such rights is whether professional judgment, in fact, was exercised.  And in determining what is ‘reasonable,’ courts must show deference to the judgment exercised by a qualified professional, whose decision is presumptively valid.”  
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Subsequent developments==
Shortly after it was remanded to the trial court the case was settled in conjunction with a state decision to close Pennhurst in 1986, and close all other such institutions.
