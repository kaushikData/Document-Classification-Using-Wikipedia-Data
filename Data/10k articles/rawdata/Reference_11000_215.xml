'''Alexander Peli''' (1915–2007) was a Ukrainian-born Israeli encyclopedist, the supervising editor of the ''[[Encyclopaedia Hebraica]]''.&lt;ref name=APeli/&gt; The project began using [[Bracha Peli|his mother]]'s publishing house in 1946 with Peli supervising. The last volume was published in 1996.&lt;ref name=bracha/&gt;

==Early life==
Alexander Pilipovetsky was born in [[Kiev]] to Meir and [[Bracha Peli|Bracha Pilipovetsky]] (born Kutzenok). The parents had married the year before against the Kutzenok family's wishes.&lt;ref name=bracha&gt;[http://jwa.org/encyclopedia/article/peli-bracha Bracha Peli], Asher Weill, Jewish Women's Archive. accessed October 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The Pilipovetskys moved at the age of six and he went to high school in [[Herzliya]].&lt;ref name=APeli/&gt; In July 1921 his family were early settlers in the new city of [[Tel Aviv]] in Palestine&lt;ref name=bracha/&gt; (the land that was to become the [[State of Israel]]). He attended the [[University of Jerusalem]] graduating  in History and Philosophy. He had been brought up with encyclopedias. His mother published the eight-volume ''General Enclopedia''. Peli's dream was to create a new encyclopedia in the language of [[Hebrew]].&lt;ref name=APeli&gt;{{cite news |author=Uri Dromi |date=5 June 2007 |script-title=he:מייסד האנציקלופדיה העברית |language=he |trans-title=Founder of the Hebrew Encyclopedia |newspaper=[[Haaretz]]|url=http://www.haaretz.co.il/misc/1.1415322 |accessdate=11 August 2014}} Obituary.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=APeli/&gt;
{{wide image|Encyclopaedia Hebraica 2.JPG|500px|''Encyclopaedia Hebraica'' - numbered from right to left.|190px|left}}
In 1944 a committee was formed to work out the aims and objectives of a project to create an encyclopedia in Hebrew. In 1948 work was started, and [[Chaim Weizmann]] was the first president of the project. He was also to be the first president of the new state of Israel. Peli was appointed supervising editor and the first editor was [[Joseph Klausner|Prof. Joseph Klausner]] The plans were drawn up and the first volume covered from [[Aleph]] to ''Australia''.

The introduction to the first volume boldly announced that it was planned to complete the encyclopedia project in "five to six years". The breadth and depth of the project was large. One entry for Israel took up a complete volume. When Peli's first editor died, he appointed [[Benzion Netanyahu]] in 1948. Netanyaho had been recommended by Klausner, before his death. The encyclopedia continued to be firmly an Israeli publication. Netanyahu, who was to remain editor until 1962, was the father of a future Israeli prime minister.

The third editor that Peli appointed was possibly the most controversial. [[Yeshayahu Leibowitz|Professor Yeshayahu Leibowitz]] caused some delays with his arguments about content, although Leibowitz was difficult outside as well as within the project team.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

It was not until 1980 that another editor, Professor Prawer, managed to declare the encyclopedia as complete. Even after that date it took five years to publish an index, and there was always a need for amendments.

In 1986, Peli's mother, who owned the publishing house, died. She left half the business to Alexander and half to his sister's family. The businesses did not prosper, and the rights to the encyclopedia was sold in 1997.&lt;ref name=bracha/&gt;

'''Apotropaic magic''' (from Greek {{transl|grc|apotrepein}} "to ward off" from {{transl|grc|apo-}} "away" and {{transl|grc|trepein}} "to turn") is a type of [[Magic (paranormal)|magic]] intended to turn away harm or evil influences, as in deflecting misfortune or averting the [[evil eye]]. Apotropaic observances may also be practiced out of vague [[superstition]] or out of tradition, as in [[good luck charm]]s (perhaps some token on a [[charm bracelet]]), [[amulets]], or gestures such as [[crossed fingers]] or [[knocking on wood]]. The Greeks made offerings to the "averting gods" ({{lang-grc|ἀποτρόπαιοι θεοί|translit=apotropaioi theoi|label=none}}), [[chthonic]] deities and [[Greek hero|hero]]es who grant safety and deflect evil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mgilleland.com/averters.htm |editor=Gilleland, Michael |translator=Jones, W.H.S. |title=Averters of Evil |date=26 June 2008 |accessdate=3 July 2010 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130615171021/http://www.mgilleland.com/averters.htm |archive-date=2013-06-15 |dead-url=unfit |quote=[[Hippocrates]], ''Regimen'' 4.89: So with this knowledge about the heavenly bodies, precautions must be taken, with change of regimen and prayers to the gods; in the case of good signs, to the Sun, to Heavenly Zeus, to Zeus, Protector of Home, to Athena, Protectress of Home, to Hermes and to Apollo; in the case of adverse signs, to the Averters of evil [apotropaioi], to Earth and to the Heroes, that all dangers may be averted. &lt;br&gt;[[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] 2.11.1 (Corinth): Before the altar, a barrow has been raised for Epopeus himself, and near the grave are the gods Averters of evil [''apotropaioi'']. Near them, the Greeks perform such rites as they are wont to do in order to avert misfortunes. ({{lang|grc|πρὸ τοῦ βωμοῦ δὲ αὐτῷ μνῆμα Ἐπωπεῖ κέχωσται, καὶ τοῦ τάφου πλησίον εἰσὶν Ἀποτρόπαιοι θεοί: παρὰ τούτοις δρῶσιν ὅσα Ἕλληνες ἐς ἀποτροπὴν κακῶν νομίζουσιν.}})}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Symbols ==
=== Egypt ===
[[File:Egyptian - Magic Wand Depicting a Procession of Deities - Walters 71510.jpg|thumb|An [[apotropaic wand]] shows a procession of protective deities. It was used in birth rituals, perhaps to draw a [[magic circle]] around the mother and child.]]
Apotropaic magical rituals were practiced throughout the [[ancient Near East]] and [[ancient Egypt|Egypt]]. Fearsome deities were invoked via ritual in order to protect individuals by warding away evil spirits. In ancient Egypt, these household rituals (performed in the home, not in state-run [[temples]]) were embodied by the deity who personified magic itself, [[Heka (god)|Heka]].&lt;ref&gt;Robert Ritner (1988). ''The Mechanics of Ancient Egyptian Magical Practice. ''Chicago: The Oriental Institute of Chicago, 14-28.&lt;/ref&gt; The two gods most frequently invoked in these rituals were the [[hippopotamus]]-formed [[fertility goddess]], [[Taweret]], and the lion-demon, [[Bes]] (who developed from the early apotropaic dwarf demon-god, [[Aha (deity)|Aha]], literally "fighter").&lt;ref&gt;James F. Romano (1978), ''The Origin of Aha (also called Bes). ''New York: College Art Association, 1978.&lt;/ref&gt;

Objects were often used in these rituals in order to facilitate communication with the gods. One of the most commonly found magical objects, the ivory apotropaic [[wand]] ([[birth tusk]]), gained widespread popularity in the [[Middle Kingdom of Egypt|Middle Kingdom]] (ca. 1550 – 1069 BCE).&lt;ref&gt;Hartwig Atlenmüller (1965). ''Die Apotopaia und Die Götter Mittelägyptens.'' Munich: Ludwig-Maximilians University.&lt;/ref&gt; These wands were used to protect expectant mothers and children from malevolent forces, and were adorned with processions of apotropaic [[solar deities]]. Likewise, protective amulets bearing the likenesses of [[ancient Egyptian deities|gods and goddesses]] like [[Taweret]] were commonly worn. Water came to be used frequently in ritual as well, wherein libation vessels in the shape of Taweret were used to pour healing water over an individual. In much later periods (when Egypt came under the [[Greeks|Greek]] [[Ptolemies]]), [[stele]] featuring the god [[Horus]] were used in similar rituals; water would be poured over the stele and—after ritually acquiring healing powers—was collected in a basin for an afflicted person to drink.{{cn|date=May 2018}}

=== Ancient Greece ===
[[File:Gorgon at the Corfu Archaelogical Museum.jpg|thumb|350px|The [[Gorgon]], flanked by [[lion]]esses and showing her belt clasp of serpents; the [[pediment]] of the 580 BCE [[Temple of Artemis (Corfu)|temple of Artemis in Corfu]]. [[Archaeological Museum of Corfu]].]] [[File:Eye-cup Staatliche Antikensammlungen 589.jpg|thumb|[[Chalcis|Chalcidian]] black-figured [[eye-cup]], circa 530 BCE. [[Staatliche Antikensammlungen]]]]
Among the ancient Greeks, the most widely used image intended to avert evil was that of the [[Gorgon]], the head of which now may be called the ''[[Gorgoneion]]'', which features wild eyes, fangs, and protruding tongue. The full figure of the Gorgon holds the apex of the oldest remaining [[Greek temple]] where she is flanked by two lionesses. The Gorgon head was mounted on the [[aegis]] and shield of [[Athena]].&lt;ref&gt;Harrison, pp 196ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Evil eye ===
[[Eye]]s were often painted to ward off the [[evil eye]]. An exaggerated apotropaic eye or a pair of eyes were painted on Greek drinking vessels called [[Kylix|''kylikes'']] ([[eye-cup]]s) from the 6th century BCE.{{clarifyme|date=July 2018}}&lt;!--only 6hC? Or 6hC on?--&gt; The exaggerated eyes may have been intended to prevent [[evil spirits]] from entering the mouth while drinking.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Apotropaism in Greek vase-paintings |author=Walter Leo Hildburgh |year=1946}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=apotropaic eye (art) |work=Encyclopædia Britannica |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/30332/apotropaic-eye |accessdate=2014-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Fishing boat]]s in some parts of the [[Mediterranean]] region still have stylised eyes painted on the bows. The defunct [[Turkish people|Turkish]] [[budget airline]], [[Fly Air]], adopted the symbol ''[[nazar boncuğu]]'' (''nazar bonjuk'') on the [[vertical stabilizer]] (fin) of its aeroplanes.{{cn|date=May 2018}} The apotropaic [[Yiddish]] expression, "{{transl|yi|kain ein horeh}}" ("no evil eye", {{Hebrew|קיין עין הרע}}, in modern [[Hebrew]] "בלי עין הרע"-"Bli ein ha'ra") is somewhat equivalent to the expression, "[[Knock on wood]]."{{cn|date=May 2018}}

=== Grotesquerie ===
[[File:Kilpeck Sheelagh na Gig.jpg|thumb|A 12th-century ''[[sheela na gig]]'' on the church at [[Kilpeck]], [[Herefordshire]]]]
People believed that the doorways and windows of buildings were particularly vulnerable to the entry or passage of [[evil]]. On [[church (building)|churches]] and [[castle]]s, [[gargoyle]]s or other [[grotesque]] faces and figures such as ''[[sheela na gig]]s'' and [[hunky punk]]s were carved to frighten away [[witch]]es and other malign influences.&lt;ref name="Tschen-Emmons 2015 p. 72"&gt;{{cite book |last=Tschen-Emmons |first=J.B. |title=Artifacts from Medieval Europe |publisher=ABC-CLIO |series=Daily Life through Artifacts |year=2015 |isbn=978-1-61069-622-7 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=K78oBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA72 |access-date=May 11, 2018 |page=72}}&lt;/ref&gt; Figures may also have been carved at fireplaces or chimneys; in some cases, simple geometric or letter carvings were used for these. When a wooden post was used to support a chimney opening, this was often an easier material for amateur carving. To discourage witchcraft, [[rowan]] wood may have been chosen for the post or mantel.&lt;ref name="Ayres, Domestic interiors"&gt;{{cite book |last=Ayres |first=James |title=Domestic interiors: the British tradition, 1500–1850 |isbn=0-300-08445-5 |publisher=Yale University Press |year=2003 |page=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly the grotesque faces carved into [[pumpkin lantern]]s (and their earlier counterparts, made from [[turnip]]s, [[Rutabaga|swedes]] or [[beet]]s) at [[Halloween]] are meant to avert evil: this season was ''[[Samhain]]'', the [[Celtic people|Celtic]] new year. As a "time between times", it was believed to be a period when [[soul]]s of the dead and other dangerous spirits walked the earth. Many European peoples had such associations with the period following the harvest in the fall. (''See also:'' [[Celtic calendar]])

=== Other ===
[[Mirror]]s and other shiny objects were believed to deflect the evil eye. Traditional English "Plough Jags" (performers of a regional variant of the [[mummers play]]) sometimes decorated their costumes (particularly their hats) with shiny items, to the extent of borrowing [[Sheffield plate|silver plate]] for the purpose. "Witch balls" are shiny [[blown glass]] ornaments, like [[Christmas baubles]], that were hung in windows.
[[File:Dacian apotropaic eyes motif Iron Gate helmet.jpg|thumb|[[Geto]]-[[Dacians|Dacian]] apotropaic eyes on the [[Helmet of Iron Gates]] (4th century BCE)]]
Items and symbols such as crosses, [[crucifix]]es, [[silver bullet]]s, wild [[rose]]s and [[garlic]] were believed to ward off or destroy [[vampire]]s.

In [[Ireland]] and [[Great Britain]], [[magpie]]s are traditionally thought to bring bad luck. Many people repeated various rhymes or [[salutation]]s to placate them.&lt;ref group="lower-alpha" name="Magpie TV"&gt;The children's TV series ''[[Magpie (TV series)|Magpie]]'' preserved these rhymes as its theme song into the 1970s.&lt;/ref&gt;

A worn-out man's [[shoe buckle|buckle]] shoe from the 18th century was found in the [[wainscoting]] of the Combination Room, [[St John's College, Cambridge]]. This was placed in the wall "as an apotropaic item intended to ward off evil and bad luck." The discovery was interesting, because this kind of magic is a silent tradition in England. After the repairs were done to the wall, the shoe was re-interred along with some current coins, a custom when dealing with finds like this. Replacing the shoe and concealing it respects the original desire of the owner.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.archaeology.org/issues/236-1611/artifact/4945-artifact-cambridge-magic-shoe Artifact]". [http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1481828 Archaeology Magazine]. November/December 2016. Page 68.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Ancient Greece]], ''[[phalloi]]'' were believed to have apotropaic qualities. Often stone reliefs would be placed above doorways, and three-dimensional versions were erected across the Greek world. Most notable of these were the urban monuments found on the island of [[Delos]]. Grotesque, [[satyr]]-like bearded faces, sometimes with the pointed cap of the workman, were carved over the doors of ovens and kilns, to protect the work from fire and mishap.&lt;ref&gt;Harrison, pp 187ff "The Ker as Gorgon".&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Apotropaic pentagram at Niemala.jpg|thumb|left|[[Apotropaic marking]], Niemelä Tenant Farm, now at [[Seurasaari]] Open Air Museum, Finland]]

A similar use of phallic representations to ward off the evil eye remains popular in modern [[Bhutan]]. It is associated with the 500-year-old [[Buddhist]] tradition of [[Drukpa Kunley]]. It is paralleled by other [[South Asia]]n uses of the [[lingam]] symbol.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/4381893.stm |title=Bhutan's phalluses ward off evil |publisher=BBC News |date=2005-03-25 |accessdate=2010-01-01 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091213181647/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/4381893.stm |archivedate=13 December 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt; |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Roman art]], apotropaic imagery was a common theme. Envy was thought to bring bad luck to the person envied. To avoid envy, [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] sought to incite laughter in their guests by using humorous images. Images such as large phalluses (see ''[[fascinus]]''), deformities like hunchbacks, or [[Pygmies]] and other non-Roman subjects were common. Romans saw [[deformity]] as comical and believed that such images could be used to deflect the evil eye.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Art in the Lives of Ordinary Romans |author=John R. Clarke |year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Europe, apotropaic [[figurehead]]s carved onto the prow of sailing ships are considered to have been a replacement for the sacrifice of a [[thrall]] during the [[Migration Period|Age of Invasions]] by Saxon and Viking sailors, to avoid bad luck on the voyage.  [[Dredging]] of the Thames under [[London Bridge]] led to the discovery of a large number of bent and broken knives, daggers, swords and coins, from the modern period and dating back to Celtic times.  This custom seems to have been to avoid bad luck, particularly when setting off on a voyage.  Similarly, the burial of an old boot or shoe by the [[lintel]] of the back door of a house seems to have had a similar intention.

[[Apotropaic mark]]s such as the initials of the [[Virgin Mary]] were scratched near the openings of buildings in England to ward off witches.&lt;ref name=Kennedy2016&gt;{{cite web |last1=Kennedy |first1=Maev |title=Witches' marks: public asked to seek ancient scratchings in buildings |url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2016/oct/31/witches-marks-historic-england-evil-spirits |work=The Guardian |accessdate=31 October 2016 |date=31 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Good luck tokens and charms ==
[[File:Itsukushima charms.jpg|thumb|Amulets for specific purposes on sale at a [[Shinto]] [[shrine]] in Japan ]]

It is difficult to differentiate between items supposed to avert evil and items intended to attract good fortune, but generally a [[talisman]] brings good luck{{cn|date=May 2018}} whereas an [[amulet]] wards off or protects against and is therefore apotropaic.

[[File:Votive tree cappadocia.jpg|thumb|left|upright|A tree covered with [[Nazar (amulet)|nazars]] against the [[evil eye]]]]
In [[Western culture]], a [[horseshoe]] was often nailed up over, or close by, doorways, normally with the ends pointing upwards; it is said to collect good luck, or to stop the luck from falling out (see [[Oakham's horseshoes]]). Model horseshoes (of card or plastic) are given as good-luck tokens, particularly at [[wedding]]s, and small paper horseshoes feature in [[confetti]].{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}
[[Irish Traveler]]s and [[Romani people|Roma]] often sell white [[Calluna|heather]] to "bring good luck". (Sometimes white [[sea-lavender]], a species of ''[[Limonium]]'', is sold instead.){{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

In Ireland, [[St Brigid's cross]]es, woven from [[Juncus|rush]], were kept indoors (in houses and animal houses) to keep away illness for the year.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

In some [[Native American cultures in the United States|Native American cultures]], a [[dreamcatcher]] made of yarn like a web is placed above a bed or sleeping area to protect sleeping children from nightmares.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

== Apotropaic names {{anchor|Naming culture}} ==
[[Ashkenazi Jews]]' apotropaic names were often given not at birth but during serious illness. An example is Nekras (''Некрас'', "not handsome" in Russian), with the hope the child would be handsome,&lt;ref name="Beider2009"&gt;{{cite book |author=Alexander Beider |title=Handbook of Ashkenazic Given Names and Their Variants |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EEYrAQAAIAAJ |year=2009 |publisher=Avotaynu |isbn=978-1-886223-43-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Yiddish]] names [[Alter (name)|Alter]] and Alte ("old").&lt;ref name="Beider2015"&gt;{{cite book |author=Alexander Beider |title=Origins of Yiddish Dialects |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XmK8CgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA183 |date=29 October 2015 |publisher=OUP Oxford |isbn=978-0-19-105981-0 |pages=183–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among [[Serbian names]] are many apotropaic names (''zaštitna imena'', "protective names"), such as [[Vuk (name)|Vuk]] (and its many derivatives) and [[Staniša]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Grković |first=Milica |title=Rečnik ličnih imena kod Srba |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1D9CAQAAIAAJ |year=1977 |publisher=Vuk Karadžić |location=Belgrade}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some traditional [[Chinese name#Taiwan|Taiwanese names]] referenced domestic animals such as "buffalo" (水牛) and "dog" (狗, 犬), or humble elements of the landscape like "soil" and "water" (土, 水). They conveyed contentment with a peaceful and low-profile life.

'''Bassett Maguire''' (August 4, 1904 – February 6, 1991) was an American botanist, head curator of the [[New York Botanical Garden]], and a leader of scientific expeditions to the [[Guyana Highlands]] in Brazil and Venezuela.

==Life==
Maguire was born in [[Gadsden, Alabama]], on August 4, 1904. He obtained his doctorate from [[Cornell University]] in 1938.&lt;ref&gt;Alfonso A. Narvaez, [https://www.nytimes.com/1991/02/08/obituaries/bassett-maguire-86-a-botanist-and-expedition-leader-is-dead.html "Bassett Maguire, 86, a Botanist and Expedition Leader, is Dead"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', February 8, 1991. Accessed 17 March 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1931, he was appointed assistant professor of botany at [[Utah State University]], where he started the Intermountain Herbarium and served as its principal collector and curator until 1942.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Maguire, Bassett (1904-1991) on JSTOR|url=https://plants.jstor.org/stable/10.5555/al.ap.person.bm000005323|language=en|doi=10.5555/al.ap.person.bm000005323}}&lt;/ref&gt; He left his position in Utah when he got a job at the [[New York Botanical Garden]] in 1943. Maguire served at the New York Botanical Garden in many roles as Curator (1943-1958); Head Curator (1958-1961); Nathanial Lord Britton Distinguished Senior Curator (1961-1971); Assistant Director (1968-1969); Director of Botany (1969-1971, 1974-1975); Senior Scientist (1972-1974); and Senior Scientist Emeritus from 1975 until his death in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nybg.org/library/finding_guide/archv/maguire_rg4b.html|title=Bassett Maguire Records|last=|first=|date=|website=www.nybg.org|publisher=Archives, The LuEsther T. Mertz Library, New York Botanical Garden|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While in Utah, Maguire started work on the ''Intermountain Flora,'' a flora on the vascular plants of the [[Intermountain West|intermountain west]], but he gradually relinquished work on this project to his former students [[Noel Holmgren]] and [[Arthur Cronquist]], as his own interests turned increasingly to tropical America.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; He led several expeditions to the Guyana Highlands, bringing back thousands of samples. In 1954 he discovered the botanically rich [[Cerro de la Neblina]] ("Mountain of the Clouds").&lt;ref&gt;Maguire, B. (January 1955).

''Geographical Review'' 49/4: 563–588. {{JSTOR|212215}}&lt;/ref&gt; He retired in 1978.

In 1990, when he was 85, New York Botanical Garden published a [[Festschrift]] in his honour: 
''The Bassett Maguire Festschrift: A Tribute to the Man and His Deeds'', edited by William R. Buck, Brian M. Boom, Richard A. Howard (Memoirs of the New York Botanical Garden Vol. 64).

He died of kidney failure in [[Doctors Hospital (Manhattan, New York)]] on February 6, 1991.

The '''Busójárás''' ([[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], meaning "Busó-walking"; in Croatian: ''Pohod bušara''&lt;ref&gt;{{hr icon}} [http://www.croatica.hu/fileadmin/glasnik/2009/glasnik20098i.pdf Hrvatski glasnik 8/2009] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100525014804/http://www.croatica.hu/fileadmin/glasnik/2009/glasnik20098i.pdf |date=2010-05-25 }} Pohod bušara, Feb 19, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;) is an annual celebration of the [[Šokci]] living in the town of [[Mohács]], [[Hungary]], held at the end of the [[Carnival]] season ("Farsang"), ending the day before [[Ash Wednesday]]. The celebration features ''Busó''s (people wearing traditional masks) and includes [[folk music]], [[Masquerade ball|masquerading]], [[parade]]s and [[dance|dancing]]. Busójárás lasts six days, usually during February. It starts on a Thursday, followed by the ''Kisfarsang'' (Little Farsang) carnival on Friday, with the biggest celebration, ''Farsang vasárnap'' (Farsang Sunday) on the seventh Sunday before [[Easter Sunday]]; the celebration then ends with ''Farsangtemetés'' (Burial of Farsang) on the following Tuesday ([[Shrove Tuesday]] or [[Mardi Gras]]).
These traditional festivities have been inscribed on the [[Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity]] of the [[UNESCO]] in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unesco.org/culture/ich/index.php?lg=en&amp;pg=00011&amp;RL=00252  Busó festivities at Mohács: masked end-of-winter carnival custom]. Description and decision at the UNESCO's website. Accessed on 11 January 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Locals explain the Carnival with two related but different legends.

[[Image:Buso masks.jpg|thumb|350px|''Busó'' masks (Mohács, February 2006)]]

According to the most popular legend, during the [[Ottoman Hungary|Ottoman times of the territory]], people from [[Mohács]] fled the town, and started living in the nearby swamps and woods to avoid Ottoman (Turkish) troops. One night, while they were sitting and talking around the fire, an old [[Šokci|Šokac]] man appeared suddenly from nowhere, and said to them: "Don't be afraid, your lives will soon turn to good and you'll return to your homes. Until that time, prepare for the battle, carve various weapons and scary masks for yourselves, and wait for a stormy night when a masked knight will come to you."  He disappeared as suddenly as he arrived. The refugees followed his orders, and some days later, on a stormy night, the knight arrived. He ordered them to put on their masks and go back to [[Mohács]], making as much noise as possible. They followed his lead. The Turks were so frightened by the noise, the masks, and the storm in the night, that they thought demons were attacking them, and they ran away from the town before sunrise.

In the older, less popular story, the ''busó''s are scaring away not the Turks but Winter itself.

In any case, the locals have celebrated the Busójárás in early February every year ever since, hosting "guest Busó teams" from neighbouring countries (Croatia and Serbia, local [[Šokci]] Croats and Slovenia) and also from Poland.

'''Chain migration''' is a term used by scholars to refer to the social process by which migrants from a particular town follow others from that town to a particular destination. The destination may be in another country or in a new location within the same country. Chain migration can be defined as a “movement in which prospective migrants learn of opportunities, are provided with transportation, and have initial accommodation and employment arranged by means of primary social relationships with previous migrants.”&lt;ref name="MacDonald"&gt;{{cite journal|author=John S. MacDonald and Leatrice D.

==Chain migration in American history==
Different groups of immigrants have employed chain migration among the different strategies used to enter, work, and live in the various republics of the Americas throughout their history. Social networks for migration are universal and not limited to specific nations, cultures, or crises. One group of immigrants to the British colonies in North America (and later the United States) was African slaves brought over forcibly; the circumstances of their migration do not fit the criteria of chain migration of free labor. Other groups, such as Germans fleeing chaos in Europe in the mid-1800s, Irish fleeing famine in Ireland in the same years, Eastern European Jews who emigrated from the Russian and Austro-Hungarian Empires in the late 1800s and early 1900s, and Italians and Japanese escaping poverty and seeking better economic conditions in the same period, did use chain migration strategies extensively, with resulting "colonies" of immigrants from the same villages, towns, and cities settling in enclaves in such cities as Boston, New York, São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Buenos Aires, Toronto, Montreal, Sydney, Melbourne, Auckland and Havana from the mid-1800s through the mid-1900s.  

Italian immigration in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century relied on a system of both chain and return migration. Chain migration helped Italian men immigrate to such cities as New York in the United States and Buenos Aires in Argentina for work as migrant laborers. Italians generally left Italy due to dire economic conditions and returned wealthy by Italian standards after working in the Americas for a number of years. Italian immigrants were called ''ritorni''&lt;ref&gt;[[#Daniels|Daniels]], 189.&lt;/ref&gt; in Italy and grouped with other Southern and Eastern European migrant laborers under the term “birds of passage” in America. However, after the passage in the United States of the [[Immigration Act of 1924]], return migration was limited and led more Italians to become naturalized citizens. The networks that had been built up by information and money due to chain and return migration provided incentives for Italian permanent migration. Mexican migration to the United States from the 1940s to the 1990s followed some of the same patterns as Italian immigration. 

While immigrants to the United States from European nations during the period before the [[McCarran–Walter Act]] of 1952 were able to immigrate legally if with relative levels of ease depending on country of origin, the [[Chinese Exclusion Act]] of 1882 barred almost all Chinese from immigrating to the United States. Nonetheless, many Chinese immigrants arrived in America by obtaining false documents. The Chinese Exclusion Act allowed the Chinese Americans already settled in the United States to stay and provided for limited numbers of family members of Chinese Americans to immigrate with the correct paperwork. This loophole and the fateful 1906 earthquake that destroyed San Francisco’s public records provided Chinese immigrants, almost entirely men, with the potential to immigrate with false documents stating their familial relationship to a Chinese American.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Daniels|Daniels]], 246.&lt;/ref&gt; These Chinese immigrants were called “paper sons,” because of their false papers. “Paper sons” relied on networks built by chain migration to buy documentation, develop strategies for convincing authorities on Angel Island of their legal status, and for starting a life in America.

==Ethnic enclaves==
The information and personal connections that lead to chain migration lead to transplanted communities from one nation to another. Throughout the history of the Americas, [[ethnic enclave]]s have been built and sustained by immigration. Different ethnic groups claimed distinct physical space in city neighborhoods to provide a reception for chain migration and maintain the community network it created. Examples of this trend include the many neighborhoods called [[Little Germany, Manhattan|Kleindeutschland]], [[Little Italy]], and [[Chinatown]] throughout the United States. 

The same was true of rural areas in the eighteenth and early nineteenth century. Some rural towns in the [[Midwestern United States]] and in [[southern Brazil]] were founded by immigrants and directly advertised in home countries. (Prominent examples include [[New Glarus, Wisconsin]] in the United States and [[Blumenau]], Santa Catarina in Brazil.) This case was especially true for many agricultural German immigrants of the nineteenth century. Certain towns were built on a homogeneous group from a particular German principality. Additionally, many of these towns exclusively spoke German until the mid-1900s in the United States and the late 1900s in Brazil. These enclaves and their contemporaries represent the close relationship between family, community, and immigration.

In the late nineteenth century, distinct Italian provinces and towns immigrated to the United States and Argentina via chain migration. Regional ties in Italy initially divided Italian ethnic identity in cities like New York and Buenos Aires, and certain enclaves included only Southern Italians or immigrants from Naples. The community ties remained strong with first generation immigrants concerning social life. These communities were originally composed of only men who immigrated for work. Once they had made enough money, many Italian men interested in settling began to bring their wives and families to their new homes in the Americas.&lt;ref&gt;Hasia Diner (2001) ''Hungering for America: Italian, Irish and Jewish Foodways in the Age of Migration'', Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, pp. 72–3, {{ISBN|0674034252}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The effects of Chinese Exclusion and discrimination prevented Chinese residents from assimilating into United States society in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century. Those factors, as well as social and cultural ties, precipitated the rise of Chinatowns as ethnic enclaves for Chinese Americans. Chain migration and the pseudo-familial nature of “paper sons” produced a relatively cohesive community that maintained ties with China.

==Gender ratios of immigration==
Single, young, male laborers were initially the largest group using chain migration to the United States in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. However, each immigrant group maintained a unique composition due to circumstances in home countries, goals of migration, and American immigration laws. 

For example, Irish migration after 1880 had a 53.6% female majority, the only migrant group with that distinction.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Daniels|Daniels]], 141.&lt;/ref&gt; Irish men and women faced economic crisis, overpopulation, and problematic inheritance laws for large families, thereby compelling many of Ireland’s daughters to leave with her sons. Italian chain migration was initially wholly male based on intent to return, but became a source of family reunification when wives eventually immigrated. 

Chinese chain migration was almost exclusively male until 1946, when the [[War Brides Act]] allowed Chinese wives of American citizens to immigrate without regard to Chinese immigration quotas. Before that time, chain migration was limited to “paper sons” and actual sons from China. The imbalanced sex ratio of Chinese immigrants was due to Chinese exclusion laws and the inability to bring current wives or to marry and return to the United States, inhibiting the corrective measure of chain migration.  When immigrant groups react to economic pull factors in labor markets, chain migration via family has been used informally to balance out the gender ratio in ethnic immigrant communities.

==Remittances==
[[Remittance]]s contribute to chain migration by aiding in both funding and interest in migration. Ralitza Dimova and Francois Charles Wolff argue that besides the recognized benefits [[remittances]] provide to the economies of the home countries of immigrants, money sent home can lead to chain migration. Dimova and Wolff posit that [[remittances]] can provide the necessary capital. H. van Dalen et al. “find that recipients of remittances are more likely to consider migrating than non-recipients. This study also references the fact that causes of chain migration through [[remittances]] tend to be variable but include such pull factors as family ties and the possibility of success.”&lt;ref&gt;Ralitza Dimova and Francois Charles Wolff, [http://ftp.iza.org/dp4083.pdf “Remittances and Chain Migration: Longitudinal Evidence from Bosnia and Herzegovina,”] (Discussion Paper, Institute for the Study of Labor (IZA), March 2009), pp. 1–2.&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides the monetary [[remittances]] sent to families in the home country, immigrants’ letters generally included valuable information about their new life, their work, and information to guide other prospective immigrants in the family or community to ease their journey. Understanding the necessary steps, whether it is what port to leave from or who to seek out to get a job and apartment, was and is vital for successful immigration.

==Advertisements==
It was common in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries for companies and even states to advertise to potential European immigrants in their home countries.&lt;ref&gt;Strohschänk, Johannes, and William G. Thiel. ''The Wisconsin Office of Emigration, 1852-1855, and Its Impact on German Immigration to the State''. Madison, WI: Max Kade Institute for German-American Studies, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; These advertisements in magazines and pamphlets made information available for immigrants to find travel and decide where to settle once in the United States. Most of the advertising was done in the effort of settling the land in the Midwestern states in the wake of the [[Homestead Act of 1862]]. Consequently, many of the peoples whom this propaganda targeted were already living agricultural lives in Northern and Eastern Europe. Additionally, once the chain of migration had begun from a farm town in Europe, the pamphlets along with letters and remittances sent from America made migration an accessible opportunity for more and more of the people of that community. This chain eventually led to partial community transplantation and development of rural ethnic enclaves in the Midwest. 

One example of this phenomenon is the chain migration of Czechs to Nebraska in the late nineteenth century. They were attracted by “glowing reports in Czech-language newspapers and magazines published [in Nebraska] and sent back home. Railroads, like the Burlington &amp; Missouri Railroad, advertised large tracts of Nebraska land for sale in Czech.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nebraskastudies.org/0500/frameset_reset.html?http://www.nebraskastudies.org/0500/stories/0501_0211.html Homestead Act: Who Were the Settlers? The Immigrant Experience]. NebraskaStudies.Org. Retrieved on 2013-07-22.&lt;/ref&gt; Many similar advertisements were read in German principalities at the same time, accounting for parallel chain migration to the Great Plains. While the pull factor of these advertisements represent the potential for chain migration, and did in fact produce it, they must be understood within the context of the push factors all potential immigrants weigh when determining to leave their home country. In the case of Czech chain migration to Nebraska and many other similar circumstances in Europe, the various push factors provided the impetus to leave but the pull factors provided by pamphlets and letters provided the chain migration structure to the eventual immigration.

==Legislation and chain migration==
While the networks and effects of chain migration are in evidence regardless of laws limiting immigration, the changing goals and provisions of immigration legislation nonetheless affect how the system of chain migration works. Exclusion and quotas have affected who chain migration draws as potential immigrants as well as how immigrants deal with their status once in the new country. However, family reunification policies in immigration law have served to promote chain migration through extended family visas. 

The [[Chinese Exclusion Act]] of 1882, and its successors creating the [[Asiatic Barred Zone]], and the [[National Origins quota]] system built by the [[Immigration Act of 1924]] were effective in limiting chain migration but could not end it entirely. Chinese immigrants took advantage of loopholes and false documents to enter the United States until the [[Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952|McCarran—Walter Act]] of 1952 gave them a migration quota. 

Other migrant groups were limited in number by the [[National Origins quota]] system, which designated national quotas based on census ratios from 1890.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Massey|Massey]], 145.&lt;/ref&gt; These ratios heavily favored Western European nations and older migrant groups, such as the English, Irish, and Germans. The ratios attempted to limit the rising number of Southern and Eastern European immigrants. The [[National Origins quota]] system provided limited family reunification as a means for chain migration and placed a preference on naturalization. If an immigrant became a U.S. citizen, he or she had the ability to obtain non-quota visas for more family members, but as a resident that number was capped annually.  Additionally, the [[Immigration Act of 1924]] formally opened the door to chain migration from the entire western hemisphere, placing that group under non-quota status.

The abolition of the [[National Origins quota]] system came with the Hart–Celler Act of 1965. This legislation placed a heavy emphasis on family reunification, designating 74% of visas for that purpose. There was no limit on spouses, unmarried minor children, and parents of U.S. citizens. The percentages for family reunification were as follows: Unmarried adult children of U.S. citizens (20%), spouses and unmarried children of permanent residents aliens (20%), married children of U.S. citizens (10%), brothers and sisters of U.S. citizens over age 21 (24%).&lt;ref&gt;[[#Massey|Massey]], 216.&lt;/ref&gt; These new visa preferences created a swell of new chain migration and immigration in general. The [[Third World]] began to outpace European immigration to America for the first time in history, surpassing it by the end of the 1960s and doubling the numbers of European migration by the end of the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Massey|Massey]], 220.&lt;/ref&gt;

In reaction to the flood of new immigrants brought by the Hart–Celler Act, and increasing numbers of undocumented immigrants from Mexico and Latin America, Congress attempted to reverse the consequences of the 1965 legislation by enforcing border patrol, using [[amnesty]] for undocumented immigrants in the [[Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986]], and proposing limits to family reunification policies. The effects of the ending the [[Bracero Program]] were increased undocumented Mexican migration because of the social capital gained during that period. Chain migration had provided relatively easy access to migration for Mexicans that the immigration legislation of the 1980s to the present has attempted to deal with.

==Chain migration in the United States in the 20th and 21st centuries==
[[File:VisaBacklog.jpg|thumb|400px|The visa number backlog for 1st and 2nd preferences increased from zero in 1995 to over 6½ years in 2009.]]
{{Refimprove section|date=January 2018}}
In the [[United States]], the term 'chain migration' is used by advocates of limiting immigration to partially explain the volume and national origins of legal immigration since 1965. U.S. citizens and [[Lawful Permanent Resident|Lawful Permanent Residents]] (or "[[Permanent residence (United States)|Green card]]" holders) may petition for visas for their immediate relatives including their children, spouses, parents, siblings. Advocates of immigration restriction believe the family unification policy is too permissive, leads to higher than expected levels of immigration, and what they consider the wrong type of immigrants. In its place, they favor increasing the number of immigrants with particular job skills. In practice, however, the wait times from when a family reunification petition is filed until the adult relative is able to enter the U.S. can be as long as 15–20 years (as of 2006). This is a result of backlogs in obtaining a visa number and visa number quotas that only allow 226,000 family-based visas to be issued annually.   

There are four family-based preference levels, data valid as of June 2009:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://travel.state.gov/visa/frvi/bulletin/bulletin_4497.html |title=Visa Bulletin, State Department, issue 9, volume IX |date=June 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090603213642/http://travel.state.gov/visa/frvi/bulletin/bulletin_4497.html |archivedate=June 3, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

# Unmarried Sons and Daughters of Citizens:  23,400 plus any numbers not required for fourth preference.
# Spouses and Children, and Unmarried Sons and Daughters of Permanent Residents:  114,200, plus the number (if any) by which the worldwide family preference level exceeds 226,000, and any unused first preference numbers: A. Spouses and Children:  77% of the overall second preference limitation, of which 75% are exempt from the per-country limit; B. Unmarried Sons and Daughters (21 years of age or older):  23% of the overall second preference limitation.
# Third:  Married Sons and Daughters of Citizens:  23,400, plus any numbers not required by first and second preferences.
# Fourth:  Brothers and Sisters of Adult Citizens:  65,000, plus any numbers not required by first three preferences.  

Backlogs in obtaining visa numbers range from four-and-a-half years (for preference level 2A) to 23-years (for preference level 4 immigrants from the Philippines).

While some backlogs have remained relatively steady for some time, since 1995, backlogs for other family-sponsored preferences have steadily increased (see image to the right).

===Chain migration and the accumulation of social capital===
According to James Coleman, “[[social capital]]…is created when the relations among persons change in ways that facilitate action.”&lt;ref&gt;James S. Coleman, Foundations of Social Theory, (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1990), 304.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Douglas Massey]], Jorge Durand and Nolan J. Malone assert that “each act of migration creates [[social capital]] among people to whom the migrant is related, thereby raising the odds of their migration.”&lt;ref&gt;[[#Massey|Massey]], 19.&lt;/ref&gt; In the context of migration, social capital refers to relationships, forms of knowledge and skills that advance one’s potential migration. One example is the positive impact of social capital on subsequent [[migration in China]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Zhao|first=Yaohui|title=The Role of Migrant Networks in Labor Migration: The Case of China|journal=Contemporary Economic Policy |date=2003 |volume=21 |issue=4 |pages=500–511 |doi=10.1093/cep/byg028}}&lt;/ref&gt; Massey et al. link their definition to Gunnar Myrdal’s theory of cumulative causation of migration, stating that, “each act of migration alters the social context within which subsequent migration decisions are made, thus increasing the likelihood of additional movement. Once the number of network connections in a community reaches a critical threshold, migration becomes self-perpetuating.”&lt;ref&gt;[[#Massey|Massey]], 20.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy over term==
During the debate on immigration policy following [[Donald Trump]]'s rescission of the [[Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals]] program, the use of the term "chain migration" became contentious.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Qiu|first1=Linda|title=The Facts Behind the Weaponized Phrase ‘Chain Migration’|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/26/us/politics/the-facts-behind-the-weaponized-phrase-chain-migration.html|work=The New York Times|date=January 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Levitz|first1=Eric|title=Trump’s Plan to End ‘Chain Migration’ Is Neither Populist Nor Nationalist|url=http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2018/01/trumps-plan-to-end-chain-migration-isnt-populist.html|website=Daily Intelligencer|publisher=New York Media, LLC|language=en|date=January 18, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.poynter.org/news/ap-style-change-two-objects-dont-have-be-motion-they-collide|title=AP style change: Two objects don't have to be in motion before they collide|website=Poynter|language=en|access-date=2018-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Theonomy===
{{main |Theonomy}}
Christian reconstructionists advocate a [[theonomic]] government and [[libertarian]] economic principles. They maintain a [[sphere sovereignty|distinction of spheres]] of authority between family, church, and state.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Michael J | last = McVicar | url = http://www.publiceye.org/magazine/v22n3/libertarian.html | title = The Libertarian Theocrats: The Long, Strange History of RJ Rushdoony and Christian Reconstructionism | journal = Public Eye |date=Fall 2007 | volume = 22 | number = 3 | accessdate = August 24, 2013 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130823060015/http://www.publiceye.org/magazine/v22n3/libertarian.html | archivedate = August 23, 2013 | deadurl = no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;*{{cite book |last=Brown |first=Mark D. |date= |title=R.O.S.E.S. - The Five Points of Christian Reconstruction |url=http://www.biblicalblueprints.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/ROSES.pdf |location=[[Omaha, Nebraska]] |publisher=[[Biblical Blueprints]] |isbn= |accessdate=February 14, 2014 |quote=His laws are to be obeyed by every human individual as well as by every human institution. [… T]he Bible does recognize several other legitimate human governments that God has established. […] These governments are under His sovereignty and are also separate from one another. Each one has its moral authority ordained by God within its limited sphere of jurisdiction. […] The Family […] The Church […] The State […] Historically, human civilizations have brought tremendous suffering and judgment upon themselves because they have blurred the distinctions between these separate governments, have failed to submit to the biblical requirements for these governments, and have over-extended the authority of one or more of these governments.}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the enforcement of moral sanctions under theonomy is carried out by the family and church government, and sanctions for moral offenses are outside the authority of civil government (which is limited to criminal matters, courts and national defense). However, some believe these distinctions become blurred, as the application of theonomy implies an increase in the authority of the civil government. Reconstructionists argue, though, that under theonomy, the authority of the state is severely limited to a point where only the judicial branch exists (e.g., a homosexual does not fear of a police force breaking in their house at night, since, under theonomy, there is no executive branch and therefore no police). Reconstructionists also say that the theocratic government is not an oligarchy or monarchy of man communicating with God, but rather, a national recognition of existing laws. Prominent advocates of Christian reconstructionism have written that according to their understanding, God's law approves of the death penalty not only for [[murder]], but also for propagators of all forms of [[idolatry]],{{Sfn | Rushdoony | 1973 | pp = 38–39}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.cmfnow.com/articles/pe179.htm | title = Interview | publisher = CMF now | first = Greg L | last = Bahnsen}}.&lt;/ref&gt; open homosexuals,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = DeMar | first = Gary | url = http://www.freebooks.com/docs/21be_47e.htm | year=1987 | title = Ruler of the Nations | page = 212 | publisher = Dominion Press}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Adultery|adulterers]], practitioners of [[witchcraft]], [[Blasphemy|blasphemers]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://s155777461.onlinehome.us/docs/214a_47e.htm | last = North | first = Gary | title = Unconditional Surrender: God's Program for Victory | page = [http://s155777461.onlinehome.us/docs/html/gnun/GNUN-125.html  118] | publisher = Online home | place = [[United States of America|US]]}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and perhaps even recalcitrant youths&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Einwechter | first = William | url = http://www.natreformassn.org/statesman/03/stndisob.html | title = Stoning Disobedient Children? | journal = The Christian Statesman |date=January–February 2003 | volume = 146 | number = [http://www.natreformassn.org/statesman/03/TOC146-1.html  1]}}.&lt;/ref&gt; (see the [[List of capital crimes in the Bible]]).

Conversely, Christian reconstructionism's founder, Rousas Rushdoony, wrote in ''[[The Institutes of Biblical Law]]'' (the founding document of reconstructionism) that Old Testament law should be applied to modern society, and he advocates the reinstatement of the Mosaic law's penal sanctions. Under such a system, the list of civil crimes which carried a death sentence would include murder, [[homosexuality]], [[adultery]], [[incest]], lying about one's [[virginity]], [[bestiality]], [[witchcraft]], [[idolatry]] or [[apostasy]], public [[blasphemy]], [[False prophet|false prophesying]], [[kidnapping]], [[rape]], and bearing false witness in a capital case.&lt;ref name="Durand"&gt;{{Citation | first = Greg Loren | last = Durand | publisher = Toccoa, Ga.: Sola Fide Publishers, 2014 | url = https://www.amazon.com/Judicial-Warfare-Christian-Reconstruction-Blueprints/dp/0692240608 | title = Judicial Warfare: Christian Reconstruction's Blueprints For Dominion, Chapter 13}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Kayser points out that the Bible advocates justice, and that biblical punishments prescribed for crimes are the ''maximum'' allowable to maintain justice and not the only available option, because lesser punishments are authorized as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.biblicalblueprints.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/DeathPenalty.pdf |title=Is the Death Penalty Just? |last=Kayser |first=Phillip G. |location=Omaha, NE |publisher=Biblical Blueprints |accessdate=February 14, 2014 |quote=What is the legitimate punishment for a crime? [… W]hat would stop a tyrannical state from once again imposing the death penalty for petty theft as was repeatedly practiced in England? On the other hand, what would hinder the state from simply fining a murderer $100? […] Without an objective standard of justice from God, how can we discern justice? […] Is it unjust to cut off the hand of a thief as is prescribed in the [[Quran|Koran]]? The [[Bible]] would say, yes. In America people are placed into jail for years for thefts that could have been paid off by means of Biblical restitution in much less time. With the biblical penalty, the criminal is rehabilitated and the victim is compensated. It is easy to see how the Biblical penalties designed to be restorative would be a wonderful alternative to present penalties. But some people have questioned whether the Biblical death penalty should be implemented. It is acknowledged that the penalty for murder is not restorative. But it is the contention of this booklet that the (maximum) penalty of death for every other crime was designed to restore sinners to repentance. […] Theonomists have tended to treat [the Hebrew phrase "möt yumat"] as a mandate for the death penalty. I argue that this is impossible, since God Himself authorized lesser penalties.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Views on pluralism===

[[Rousas Rushdoony]] wrote in his ''magnum opus'', ''[[The Institutes of Biblical Law]]'': 
"The heresy of democracy has since [the days of colonial New England] worked havoc in church and state"&lt;ref&gt;

Rushdoony believed that a [[republic]] is a better form of civil government than a democracy.  According to Rushdoony, a republic avoided mob rule and the rule of the "51%" of society; in other words "might does not make right" in a republic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite interview|last=Rushdoony|first=R. J.|interviewer=[[Bill Moyers]]|publisher=[[PBS]]|location=Alexandria, VA|title=On Earth As It Is in Heaven|work=God and Politics}} &lt;/ref&gt; Rushdoony wrote that America's separation of powers between 3 branches of government is a far more neutral and better method of civil government than a direct democracy, stating "[t]he [American] Constitution was designed to perpetuate a Christian order".  Rushdoony argues that the Constitution's purpose was to protect religion from the federal government and to preserve "states' rights."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Rushdoony |first=Rousas J. |date=1965 |title=The Nature of the American System |url=http://chalcedon.edu/research/books/the-nature-of-the-american-system-2  |publisher=Ross House Books |isbn=1879998270 |archive-url=http://chalcedon.edu/research/books/the-nature-of-the-american-system-2/ |archive-date=March 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Douglas W. Kennard, a Professor Theology and Philosophy at the [[Houston Graduate School of Theology]], wrote with regard to Christian reconstructionism, that Christians of non-[[Reformed]] traditions, such as some "Baptist, Methodist, Catholic, [and] Orthodox", would be "under threat of capital punishment as fostered by the extreme Theonomist."&lt;ref name="Kennard2015"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kennard|first=Douglas W.|title=Biblical Covenantalism|date=4 December 2015|publisher=Wipf and Stock Publishers|language=English|isbn=9781625646606|page=26}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, [[Ligon Duncan]] has stated that "Roman Catholics to Episcopalians to Presbyterians to Pentecostals", as well as "Arminian and Calvinist, charismatic and non-charismatic, high Church and low Church traditions are all represented in the broader umbrella of Reconstructionism (often in the form of the "Christian America" movement)."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reformed.org/ethics/index.html?mainframe=/ethics/ligon_duncan_critique.html|title=Moses' Law for Modern Government: The Intellectual and Sociological Origins of the Christian Reconstructionist Movement|date=15 October 1994|publisher=Center for Reformed Theology and Apologetics|language=English|accessdate=1 July 2017|author=J.

==Influence on the Christian right in general==
{{see also|Dominionism}}
Although relatively small in terms of the number of self-described adherents, Christian reconstructionism has played a role in promoting the trend toward explicitly Christian politics in the larger American [[Christian right]].{{Sfn | Martin | 1996}}{{Rp | needed = yes | date = May 2013}}  This is the wider trend to which some critics refer, generally, as dominionism. They also allegedly have influence disproportionate to their numbers among advocates of the growth of the Christian [[homeschooling]] and other Christian education movements that seek independence from the direct oversight or support of the civil government. Because their numbers are so small compared to their influence, they are sometimes accused of being secretive and conspiratorial.&lt;ref name= "Diamond1995a"/&gt;{{Sfn | Clarkson | 1997}}{{Rp | needed = yes|date=March 2012}}&lt;ref name= "Diamond1989a" /&gt;{{Sfn | Berlet | Lyons | 2000}}{{Rp | needed = yes|date=March 2012}}

In [https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=matthew+28%3A18&amp;version=KJV Matthew 28:18], Jesus says, "All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth." This verse is seen as an announcement by Jesus that he has assumed authority over all earthly authority.  In that light, some theologians interpret the [[Great Commission]] as a command to exercise that authority in his name, bringing all things (including societies and cultures) into subjection under his commands.  [[Rousas Rushdoony]], for example, interpreted the Great Commission as a republication of the "creation mandate",{{Sfn | Rushdoony | 1973 | p = 729}} referring to [https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=genesis+1%3A28&amp;version=KJV Genesis 1:28]
{{quote |Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing...|wide=yes}}

For Rushdoony, the idea of dominion implied a form of Christian [[theocracy]] or, more accurately, a [[theonomy]]. For example, he wrote that:
{{quote|The purpose of Christ's coming was in terms of the creation mandate… The redeemed are called to the original purpose of man, to exercise dominion under God, to be covenant-keepers, and to fulfil "the righteousness of the law" (Rom. 8:4)… Man is summoned to create the society God requires.{{Sfn | Rushdoony | 1973 | pp = 3–4}}}}

Elsewhere he wrote:
{{quote |The man who is being progressively sanctified will inescapably sanctify his home, school, politics, economics, science, and all things else by understanding and interpreting all things in terms of the word of God.&lt;ref name = "rushdoony2"&gt;{{Citation | last = Rushdoony | first = Rousas John | contribution = Foreword | editor-link = Greg Bahnsen | editor-first = Greg | editor-last = Bahnsen | title = Theonomy in Christian Ethics | edition = 3rd | page = xii}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

According to sociologist and professor of religion William Martin, author of ''With God on Our Side'':
{{Quote |It is difficult to assess the influence of Reconstructionist thought with any accuracy. Because it is so genuinely radical, most leaders of the Religious Right are careful to distance themselves from it.  At the same time, it clearly holds some appeal for many of them. One undoubtedly spoke for others when he confessed, 'Though we hide their books under the bed, we read them just the same.' In addition, several key leaders have acknowledged an intellectual debt to the theonomists. Jerry Falwell and D. James Kennedy have endorsed Reconstructionist books. Rushdoony has appeared on Kennedy's television program and the 700 Club several times.  Pat Robertson makes frequent use of 'dominion' language; his book, ''The Secret Kingdom'', has often been cited for its theonomy elements; and pluralists were made uncomfortable when, during his presidential campaign, he said he 'would only bring Christians and Jews into the government,' as well as when he later wrote, 'There will never be world peace until God's house and God's people are given their rightful place of leadership at the top of the world.' And Jay Grimstead, who leads the Coalition on Revival, which brings Reconstructionists together with more mainstream evangelicals, has said, 'I don't call myself [a Reconstructionist],' but 'A lot of us are coming to realize that the Bible is God's standard of morality … in all points of history … and for all societies, Christian and non-Christian alike… It so happens that Rushdoony, Bahnsen, and North understood that sooner.' He added, 'There are a lot of us floating around in Christian leadership—James Kennedy is one of them—who don't go all the way with the theonomy thing, but who want to rebuild America based on the Bible.'{{Sfn | Martin | 1996 | p = 354}}}}

==Christian critics==
[[Michael Horton (theologian)|Michael Horton]] of [[Westminster Seminary California]] has warned against the seductiveness of power-religion. The Christian rhetoric of the movement is weak, he argues, against the logic of its authoritarian and legalistic program, which will always drive reconstructionism toward sub-Christian ideas about sin, and the perfectibility of human nature (such as to imagine that, if Christians are in power, they won't be inclined to do evil). On the contrary, Horton and others maintain, God's Law can, often has been, and will be put to evil uses by Christians and others, in the state, in churches, in the marketplace, and in families; and these crimes are aggravated, because to oppose a wrong committed through abuse of God's law, a critic must bear being labeled an enemy of God's law.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | archivedate = April 15, 2007 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070415190147/http://www.modernreformation.org/mh94godsname.htm | url = http://www.modernreformation.org/mh94godsname.htm | title = In God's Name: Guidelines for Proper Political Involvement | first = Michael | last = Horton |date=Sep–Oct 1994 | journal = Modern Reformation Magazine | volume = 3 | issue = 5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[J. Ligon Duncan]] of the Department of [[systematic theology|Systematic Theology]] of [[Reformed Theological Seminary]] in [[Jackson, Mississippi]], warns that "Theonomy, in gross violation of biblical patterns and common sense, ignores the context of the giving of the law to the redemptive community of the Old Testament. This constitutes an approach to the nature of the civil law very different from Calvin and the rest of the Reformed tradition, which sees the civil law as God's application of his eternal standards to the particular exigencies of his people." Duncan rejects the reconstructionist's insistence that "the Old Testament civil case law is normative for the civil magistrate and government in the New Covenant era". He views their denial of the threefold distinction between moral, civil, and ceremonial law as representing one of the severe flaws in the reconstructionist hermeneutic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.reformed.org/ethics/index.html?mainframe=/ethics/ligon_duncan_critique.html|title = Moses' Law for Modern Government: The Intellectual and Sociological Origins of the Christian Reconstructionist Movement | year = 1994 | last =Duncan | first = J Ligon|accessdate=August 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Professor [[Meredith Kline]], whose own theology has influenced the method of several reconstructionist theologians, has adamantly maintained that reconstructionism makes the mistake of failing to understand the special prophetic role of biblical Israel, including the laws and sanctions, calling it "a delusive and grotesque perversion of the teachings of scripture."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Comments on an Old-New Error|pages=172–89|journal=Westminster Theological Journal | issue= 41| date = Fall 1978| last =Kline | first = Meredith|url= http://www.covopc.org/Kline/Kline_on_Theonomy.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kline's student, Lee Irons, furthers the critique:

{{quote |According to the Reformed theocrats apparently… the only satisfactory goal is that America become a Christian nation.

Ironically... it is the wholesale rejection (not revival) of theocratic principles that is desperately needed today if the church is to be faithful to the task of gospel witness entrusted to her in the present age…  It is only as the church… puts aside the lust for worldly influence and power – that she will be a positive presence in society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.upper-register.com/theonomy/reformed_theocrats.html|title=The Reformed Theocrats: A Biblical Theological Response| year =2002|author=Irons, Lee|accessdate=March 30, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Rodney Clapp]] wrote that reconstructionism is an anti-democratic movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | newspaper= Christianity Today| volume = 31 | issue = 3|date=February 20, 1987|pages=17–23|title= Democracy as Heresy|author= Clapp, Rodney}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| year = 1987|author = North, Gary |title=Honest Reporting as Heresy|newspaper=Westminster's Confession|pages=317–41}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an April 2009 article in ''[[Christianity Today]]'' about [[Douglas Wilson (theologian)#Controversy|controversial]] [[theologian]] and writer [[Douglas Wilson (theologian)|Douglas Wilson]], the magazine described reconstructionism as outside the 'mainstream' views of [[evangelical Christians]]. It also stated that it "borders on a call for outright theocracy".&lt;ref name=today&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2009/april/24.42.html?start=1 | title = The Controversialist | first = Molly | last = Worthen | journal = [[Christianity Today]] |date=April 2009 | volume = 53 | accessdate = June 16, 2009 | issue = 4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[George M. Marsden]], a professor of history at the [[University of Notre Dame]], has remarked in ''[[Christianity Today]]'' that "Reconstructionism in its pure form is a radical movement". He also wrote, "[t]he positive proposals of Reconstructionists are so far out of line with American evangelical commitments to American republican ideals such as religious freedom that the number of true believers in the movement is small."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.christianitytoday.com/bc/2006/marapr/3.10.html The Sword of the Lord]. ''[[Christianity Today]]''. Published March 1, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Popular religious author, feminist, and former [[Catholicism|Roman Catholic]] [[nun]], [[Karen Armstrong]] sees a potential for "[[fascism]]" in Christian reconstructionism, and sees the eventual Dominion envisioned by theologians R.&amp;nbsp;J. Rushdoony and Gary North as: "totalitarian. There is no room for any other view or policy, no democratic tolerance for rival parties, no individual freedom."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Armstrong | title = [[The Battle for God]] | pages = 361–2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditional Reformed Christians have argued that Christian reconstructionists have "significantly misunderstood the positions of Calvin, other Reformed teachers and the [[Westminster Confession]] concerning the relationship between the Sinai covenant's ethical stipulations and the Christian obligation to the Mosaic judicial laws today."&lt;ref name="Cunningham2013"&gt;{{cite book|last=Cunningham|first=Timothy R.|title=How Firm a Foundation?: An Exegetical and Historical Critique of the "Ethical Perspective of [Christian] Reconstructionism" Presented in Theonomy in Christian Ethics|date=28 March 2013|publisher=Wipf and Stock Publishers|language=English|isbn=9781608994618|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relation to dominionism==
Some sociologists and critics refer to reconstructionism as a type of [[dominionism]].  These critics claim that the frequent use of the word ''dominion'' by reconstructionist writers, strongly associates the critical term ''dominionism'' with this movement. As an ideological form of ''dominionism'', reconstructionism is sometimes held up as the most typical form of dominion theology.{{Sfn | Martin | 1996}}{{Rp | needed = yes | date = May 2013}}&lt;ref name= "Diamond1995a" /&gt;{{Sfn | Clarkson | 1997}}{{Rp | needed = yes|date=March 2012}}&lt;ref name="Diamond1989a"&gt;Diamond, Sara. 1989.

The Protestant theologian [[Francis Schaeffer]] is linked with the movement by some critics, but some reconstructionist thinkers are highly critical of Schaeffer's positions and he himself disavowed any connection or affiliation with reconstructionism, though he did cordially correspond with Rushdoony on occasion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Did Francis Schaeffer Believe Rushdoony Was Crazy? | publisher = Chalcedon | archivedate = February 13, 2010 | url = http://www.chalcedon.edu/blog/2008/01/did-francis-schaeffer-believe-rushdoony.php | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100213040137/http://www.chalcedon.edu/blog/2008/01/did-francis-schaeffer-believe-rushdoony.php}}&lt;/ref&gt; Authors Sara Diamond and Fred Clarkson suggest that Schaeffer shared with reconstructionism the tendency toward dominionism.&lt;ref name = "Diamond1995a"&gt;Diamond, Sara. 1995.

Christian reconstructionists{{who|date=January 2018}} object to the ''dominionism'' and the ''dominion theology'' labels, which they say misrepresent their views. Some separate Christian cultural and political movements object to being described with the label ''dominionism'', because in their mind the word implies attachment to reconstructionism. In reconstructionism the idea of ''godly'' dominion, subject to God, is contrasted with the ''autonomous'' dominion of mankind in rebellion against God.

The '''''Compendium of Macromolecular Nomenclature''''', by the [[International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry]] (IUPAC), provides definition of [[polymer]] related terms and rules of nomenclature of polymers. It is referred to as the '''''Purple Book'''''. It was published in 1991 ({{ISBN|0-63202-8475}}) by [[Blackwell Science]]. The author of this book is W.V. Metanomski.

The expansion of this book named '''''Compendium of Polymer Terminology and Nomenclature''''': IUPAC Recommendations, 2008 was published by the [[Royal Society of Chemistry]] in 2009 ({{ISBN|978 0 85404 491 7}}).

The rules and definitions were set up by the IUPAC Commission on Macromolecular Nomenclature.

[[File:Computer history museum.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Computer History Museum]]]]
A '''computer museum''' is devoted to the study of historic [[computer hardware]] and [[software]], where a "museum" is a "permanent institution in the service of society and of its development, open to the public, which acquires, conserves, researches, communicates, and exhibits the ''tangible and intangible'' heritage of humanity and its environment, for the purposes of education, study, and enjoyment", as defined by the [[International Council of Museums]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://icom.museum/statutes.html#2 |title=ICOM Statutes |accessdate=2008-04-05 |format= |work=International Council of Museums }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some computer museums exist within larger institutions, such as the [[Science Museum, London|Science Museum]] in London and the [[Deutsches Museum]] in Munich. Others are dedicated specifically to computing, such as the [[Computer History Museum]] in [[Mountain View, California|Mountain View]], California, the [[American Computer &amp; Robotics Museum]] in [[Bozeman, Montana]], [[The National Museum of Computing]] at [[Bletchley Park]], [[The Centre for Computing History]] in Cambridge and the [[Nexon Computer Museum]] in [[Jeju Province]]. Some specialize in the early history of computing, others in the era that started with the first personal computers such as the [[Apple I]] and [[Altair 8800]], [[Apple II]]s, older [[Apple Macintosh]]es, [[Commodore International]]s, [[Amiga]]s, [[IBM PC]]s and more rare computers such as the [[Osborne 1]]. Some concentrate more on research and conservation, others more on education and entertainment. There are also private collections, most of which can be visited by appointment.{{fact|date=December 2017}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="30866">[[Cryptic crossword]]s often use [[abbreviation]]s to clue individual letters or short fragments of the overall solution. These include:

*Any conventional abbreviations found in a standard dictionary, such as:
**"current": &lt;small&gt;AC&lt;/small&gt; (for "alternating current"); less commonly, &lt;small&gt;DC&lt;/small&gt; (for "direct current"); or even &lt;small&gt;I&lt;/small&gt; (the symbol used in physics and electronics)
*[[Roman numerals]]: for example the word "six" in the clue might be used to indicate the letters &lt;small&gt;VI&lt;/small&gt;
*The name of a [[chemical element]] may be used to signify its symbol; e.g., [[tungsten]] for &lt;small&gt;W&lt;/small&gt;
*[[Country codes]]: "Switzerland" can indicate the letters &lt;small&gt;CH&lt;/small&gt;
*[[ICAO spelling alphabet]]: where Mike signifies &lt;small&gt;M&lt;/small&gt; and Romeo &lt;small&gt;R&lt;/small&gt;
*Conventional abbreviations for US cities and states: for example, New York can indicate &lt;small&gt;NY&lt;/small&gt; and "California" &lt;small&gt;CA&lt;/small&gt; or &lt;small&gt;CAL&lt;/small&gt;.

The abbreviation is not always a short form of the word used in the clue. For example:

*"Knight" for &lt;small&gt;N&lt;/small&gt; (the symbol used in chess notation)

Taking this one stage further, the clue word can hint at the word or words to be abbreviated rather than giving the word itself. For example:

*"About" for &lt;small&gt;C&lt;/small&gt; or &lt;small&gt;CA&lt;/small&gt;, abbreviations of "circa", meaning "about". "About" can also be abbreviated to &lt;small&gt;RE&lt;/small&gt;, for "regarding".
*"Say" for &lt;small&gt;EG&lt;/small&gt;, used to mean "for example".

More obscure clue words of this variety include:

*"Model" for &lt;small&gt;T&lt;/small&gt;, referring to the [[Model T]].
*"Beginner" or synonyms such as "novice" or "student" for &lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt;, as in [[L-plate]].
*"Bend" for &lt;small&gt;S&lt;/small&gt; or &lt;small&gt;U&lt;/small&gt; (as in "S-bend" and "U-bend")
*"Books" for &lt;small&gt;OT&lt;/small&gt; or &lt;small&gt;NT&lt;/small&gt;, as in Old Testament or New Testament.
*"Sailor" for &lt;small&gt;AB&lt;/small&gt;, abbreviation of able-bodied.
*"Take" for &lt;small&gt;R&lt;/small&gt;, abbreviation of the Latin word ''recipe'', meaning "take".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5210">'''Drift hypothesis''', concerning the relationship between [[mental illness]] and [[social class]], is the argument that illness causes one to have a downward shift in social class.&lt;ref name="Hurst2007"&gt;{{cite book |last=Hurst |first=Charles E. |year=2007 |title=Social Inequality: Forms, Causes, and Consequences |location=Boston |publisher=Pearson Education |isbn=978-0-205-48436-2 |edition=6th }}&lt;/ref&gt; The circumstances of one's social class do not cause the onset of a mental disorder, but rather, an individual's deteriorating mental health occurs first, resulting in low social class attainment.&lt;ref name="Perry1996"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Perry |first=Melissa J. |year=1996 |title=The Relationship between Social Class and Mental Disorder |journal=Journal of Primary Prevention |volume=14 |issue=1 |pages=17–30 |doi=10.1007/BF02262736 |pmid=24254919 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The drift hypothesis is the opposing theory of the [[social causation thesis]], which says being in a lower social class is a contributor to the development of a mental illness.

== Support ==
A study by E. M. Goldberg and S. L. Morrison looked at the relationship between [[schizophrenia]] and social class. They wanted to find out if men, before they had been admitted to a mental hospital, drifted down the occupational scale to unskilled jobs because of their developing illness, or if it was because they were born into families with a lower social class attainment, that they developed their mental illness. They looked at men who had their first admission in a mental hospital between the ages of 25–34. They also looked at their fathers' occupation, in order to see if the social class they grew up in played a role in the development of schizophrenia. They found the men had grown up in families whose social class was similar to the general population. So the social class they grew up in  did not seem to be a contributor to the development of their schizophrenia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Goldberg |first1=E. M. |last2=Morrison |first2=S. L. |year=1988 |chapter=Schizophrenia and Social Class |editor-first=Carol |editor-last=Buck |title=The Challenge of Epidemiology: Issues and Selected Readings |pages=368–383 |location=Washington, DC |publisher=Pan American Health Organization |isbn=978-92-75-11505-3 }} Retrieved December 2, 2007, from PsycInfo Database&lt;/ref&gt;

== Opposition ==
The main opposition to the drift hypothesis is the social causation thesis, which says social class position is [[causal]]ly related to the probability of mental illness. John W. Fox, from the [[University of Northern Colorado]], conducted a study in 1990 that looked at previous studies concerning the relationship between social class and mental illness. These studies he looked at supported the drift hypothesis, but when he examined them, he found their conclusions were "based on assumptions and methods that lacked empirical support."&lt;ref name="Fox1990"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Fox |first=John W. |year=1990 |title=Social Class, Mental Illness, and Social Mobility: The Social Selection-Drift Hypothesis for Serious Mental Illness |journal=Journal of Health and Social Behavior |volume=31 |issue=4 |pages=344–353 |doi=10.2307/2136818 |pmid=2135936 |jstor=2136818 }} Retrieved December 2, 2007, from PsycInfo Database&lt;/ref&gt; Another statement in Fox's study was, in studies done on social class and mental illness, "identify drift as an individual's downward intergenerational [[social mobility]] after the onset of mental illness, rather than as residential drift from higher to lower class status areas".&lt;ref name="Fox1990" /&gt; So depending on what one's definition of drift hypothesis is, there will be data either to support or refute the validity of it.

From an economic perspective of social class and mental illness, the social causation thesis is the ruling theory. People who are unemployed have been shown to have an increased amount of distress; have more physical health problems, which are often seen to be contributors of depression;&lt;ref name="Hurst2007" /&gt; and experience more frequent and more uncontrollable life events, which studies have shown increase the risk of developing some form of mental illness.&lt;ref name="Perry1996" /&gt;

When looking at the gender differences in people who have mental illnesses, women are overly represented. Women are also the majority of people who are in poverty. [[Deborah Belle]], a professor at [[Boston University]], did a literature review on poverty and women's mental health and examined the psychological stressors that poor women and mothers experience. "A number of community studies conducted in the 1970s reported that mothers who were in financially strained circumstances were more likely to develop depressive symptoms than other women.&lt;ref name="Perry1996" /&gt;

The reality is people who become mentally ill suffer a substantial loss of income.  With this comes the need to accept [[public housing]] or food or utilities, if the person can find them.  Often mentally ill people are unable to manage for themselves so a team of social workers has to intervene.

'''''Faction Paradox''''' is a series of novels, audio stories, short story anthologies, and comics set in and around the "War in Heaven", a history-spanning conflict between the godlike "Great Houses" and their mysterious enemy. The series is named after a minor group in the War, a fictional [[time travel]]ling [[cult]] / [[rebellion|rebel]] group / [[organized crime]] syndicate originally created by author [[Lawrence Miles]] for [[BBC Books]]' ''[[Doctor Who]]'' novels.

==Overview==
Originally a subplot in the [[Eighth Doctor Adventures]], the War involves several characters and concepts evolved from the original ''Doctor Who'' set-up. In several cases, the ''Faction Paradox'' series still features these groups, albeit with names changed for reasons both literary (most of the groups or items mentioned are described from different perspectives) and legal (the Faction and the Enemy are Miles's creations, but other elements are not &amp;mdash; thus the Great Houses are the Faction Paradox range's equivalent to ''Doctor Who'''s [[Time Lord]]s).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.curufea.com/Wikka/wikka.php?wakka=FactionDoctor |title=The Faction and the Doctor |publisher=Curufea |date=2009-12-10 |accessdate=2011-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Faction Paradox themselves are ''not'' the enemy in this War, and play a neutral part, willing to act against both sides in their own interests. Lawrence Miles has described them as "a ritualistic time-travelling guerrilla organisation".

The semi-mythical founder of Faction Paradox is [[Grandfather Paradox (Doctor Who)|Grandfather Paradox]], named after the [[grandfather paradox]] of time travel theory. Originally a member of the Great Houses himself, the Grandfather created a new group after he became frustrated with the ways of the Great Houses. Faction Paradox therefore takes a good deal of pleasure in irritating the Great Houses, and many of their traditions and rituals are aligned in direct opposition to the way the Great Houses do things. Their time machines are bigger on the inside, in much the same way as TARDISes are, and the familial titles its members use (eg "Father", "Cousin") reference family units which the Great Houses lost when they became sterile.

Faction Paradox also take a perverse pride in causing time paradoxes (something that is against the laws of the Great Houses) and achieving impossible or absurd effects for their own sake. For instance, they typically wear ritual skull masks which are in fact the skulls of vampirised members of the Great Houses who, in the Great Houses' version of history, never existed. Their stronghold on Earth exists in a version of London, within what they call "The Eleven-Day Empire", bought from the British government in 1752. In that year, the [[British Empire]] [[Calendar (New Style) Act 1750|first adopted the Gregorian calendar]], and in so doing had to correct their dating scheme by 11 days (2 September 1752 being followed by 14 September 1752). Faction Paradox claimed the missing 11 days as their base (building on the illogicity that only the numbering scheme changed and no days were actually "missing").

==Stories==
===Doctor Who (BBC Books)===
After a brief mention of [[Grandfather Paradox (Doctor Who)|Grandfather Paradox]] in the [[Virgin New Adventures]] novel ''[[Christmas on a Rational Planet]]'', Faction Paradox and the War in Heaven made their debut in [[BBC Books]]' [[Eighth Doctor]] [[Eighth Doctor Adventures|novels]].

The most relevant books to the ''Faction Paradox'' universe are
*''[[Alien Bodies]]'' ([[Lawrence Miles]], 1997)
*''[[Unnatural History (Doctor Who)|Unnatural History]]'' ([[Kate Orman]] and [[Jonathan Blum (writer, born 1972)|Jon Blum]], 1999)
*''[[Interference: Book One|Interference: Book One (Shock Tactic)]]'' (Lawrence Miles, 1999)
*''[[Interference: Book Two|Interference: Book Two (The Hour of the Geek)]]'' (Lawrence Miles, 1999)
*''[[The Blue Angel]]'' ([[Paul Magrs]], 1999)
*''[[The Taking of Planet 5]]'' ([[Simon Bucher Jones]] and [[Mark Clapham]], 1999)
*''[[The Shadows of Avalon]]'' ([[Paul Cornell]], 2000)
*''[[The Adventuress of Henrietta Street]]'' (Lawrence Miles, 2001)

Several other ''Doctor Who'' novels featured or referenced Faction Paradox, most notably ''[[The Ancestor Cell]]'' (written by [[Stephen Cole (writer)|Stephen Cole]] and [[Peter Anghelides]] in 2000), ''[[The Quantum Archangel]]'' (written by [[Craig Hinton]] in 2001), and ''[[The Gallifrey Chronicles (2005 novel)|The Gallifrey Chronicles]]'' (written by [[Lance Parkin]] in 2005), but were contradicted or otherwise ignored in the ''Faction Paradox'' series.

===Faction Paradox (BBV)===
A series of full-cast audio dramas dubbed ''The Faction Paradox Protocols'' was produced by [[BBV]] between 2001 and 2004. All were written by [[Lawrence Miles]]. These stories centred on two Cousins of the Faction, Justine and Eliza. (Justine had previously featured in the [[BBC]] novel ''[[Alien Bodies]]'', and Eliza appeared in ''[[Dead Romance]]'' as "Christine Summerfield".) The first two stories were set in the Eleven-Day Empire; the second two in 18th century London; and the last two were split between Justine's pre-Faction past and the Great Houses' [[Shada|prison facility]]. Although there were six releases and an ongoing story, each pair (usually released close together) formed a two-part story. In order they were:

*''The Eleven-Day Empire''
*''The Shadow Play''
*''Sabbath Dei''
*''In the Year of the Cat''
*''Movers''
*''A Labyrinth of Histories''

===Faction Paradox (Mad Norwegian Press)===
In 2002 [[Mad Norwegian Press]] published a multi-author faux-encyclopedia to the first 50 years of the War in Heaven, edited by Faction Paradox creator [[Lawrence Miles]], as a companion to the BBV audios. After the success of ''The Book of the War'', Mad Norwegian began publishing a ''Faction Paradox'' series of novels set in the same universe. These novels roam the ongoing War in Heaven; despite the series' name, the Faction and its members are not the focus, sometimes featuring only as minor characters, and sometimes not appearing at all. The books also featured characters from the ''Doctor Who'' novels, including [[Chris Cwej]] and [[Compassion (Doctor Who)|Compassion]].

*''[[The Book of the War]]'' ([[Lawrence Miles]] et al, 2002)
*''[[This Town Will Never Let Us Go]]'' ([[Lawrence Miles]], 2003)
*''[[Of the City of the Saved...]]'' ([[Philip Purser-Hallard]], 2004)
*''[[Warlords of Utopia]]'' ([[Lance Parkin]], 2004)
*''[[Warring States (novel)|Warring States]]'' ([[Mags L Halliday]], 2005)
*''[[Erasing Sherlock]]'' ([[Kelly Hale]], 2006)

Mad Norwegian also republished the [[Virgin New Adventures]] novel ''[[Dead Romance]]'' as part of their ''Faction Paradox'' line in 2003.

===Faction Paradox (Image Comics)===
[[File:Faction Paradox 01 cover.jpg|right|thumb|Cover of the first comics issue]]
In 2003, the first two issues of a Faction Paradox comic were produced by Mad Norwegian and published by [[Image Comics]]. The series was subsequently cancelled. The comic was written by [[Lawrence Miles]] with art from [[Jim Calafiore]] and inks by [[Peter Palmiotti]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.comicvine.com/faction-paradox/4050-26707/ Faction Paradox]&lt;/ref&gt; It was set after the events of the War in Heaven, though due to its short run it did not give much detail on the post-War universe.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.comicbookdb.com/title.php?ID=4654 Comic Db Entry for Faction Paradox]&lt;/ref&gt; It tied into events described in ''The Faction Paradox Protocols'', ''[[The Book of the War]]'', and ''[[The Adventuress of Henrietta Street]]''.

===Faction Paradox (Magic Bullet)===
In 2004 [[Magic Bullet Productions]], known for their ''[[Kaldor City]]'' audio dramas, obtained the license to produce further ''Faction Paradox'' audios, dubbed ''The True History of Faction Paradox''. The narrative of this series continued from ''The Faction Paradox Protocols'', although the first CD was also written to be accessible to newcomers. Like the BBV audios, these stories focused on Cousin Justine and Cousin Eliza, but the characters were recast.

The dramas in the series, released between 2005 and 2009, have featured guest stars including [[Julian Glover]], [[Peter Miles (English actor)|Peter Miles]], [[Philip Madoc]] and [[Gabriel Woolf]].  Woolf plays the ancient Egyptian god [[Set (mythology)|Sutekh]], whom he had previously played in the 1975 ''Doctor Who'' story ''[[Pyramids of Mars]]''.  The six titles are:

*''Coming To Dust''&lt;ref name="comingdust"&gt;[http://www.kaldorcity.com/audios/faction/dust.html The True History of Faction Paradox Vol 1: Coming to Dust]&lt;/ref&gt;
*''The Ship of a Billion Years''&lt;ref name="ship"&gt;[http://www.kaldorcity.com/audios/faction/ship.html The True History of Faction Paradox Vol 2: The Ship of a Billion Years]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Faction Paradox (Random Static)===
In 2007, New Zealand-based publisher [[Random Static]] announced they would be publishing further ''Faction Paradox'' novels. What turned out to be the sole title of the new range was published in January 2008. The cover art, by Emma Weakley, won the [[Sir Julius Vogel Award]] for Best Artwork in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bookawards.co.nz/sirjuliusvogel.html#08win Sir Julius Vogel Winners 2008] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100605013521/http://www.bookawards.co.nz/sirjuliusvogel.html |date=5 June 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:four-corner method.svg|200px|right|thumb|The code of 法 ({{zh|p=fǎ}}; meaning "method/law/France") is an example of a fifth digit for an extra part: 3413&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; (丶十一丶&lt;sub&gt;一&lt;/sub&gt;).]]
The '''Four-Corner Method''' ({{zh|t=四角號碼檢字法|s=四角号码检字法|p=sì jiǎo hàomǎ jiǎnzì fǎ|l=four corner code lookup-character method}}) is a [[Chinese input methods for computers|character-input method]] used for [[Character encoding|encoding]] [[Chinese character]]s into either a computer or a manual typewriter, using four or five [[numerical digit]]s per [[Character (computing)|character]]. The Four-Corner Method is also known as the '''Four-Corner System'''.

The four digits encode the shapes found in the four corners of the symbol, top-left to bottom-right.  Although this does not uniquely identify a Chinese character, it leaves only a very short list of possibilities.  A fifth digit can be added to describe an extra part above the bottom-right if necessary.

==Origin==
The Four-Corner Method was invented in the 1920s by [[Wang Yunwu]] (王雲五), the editor in chief at Commercial Press Ltd., China. Its development was based mainly on contributions by the Russian scholar [[Otto Rosenberg]]&lt;ref&gt;Karenina Kollmar-Paulenz (ed.). "Otto Ottonovich Rosenberg and his Contribution to Buddhology in Russia," Wiener Studien zur Tibetologie und Buddhismuskunde. Heft 41, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wason.library.cornell.edu/iaol/Vol.44/barlow_3.pdf |title=The Mysterious Case of the Brilliant Young Russian Orientalist... |author=John Barlow |accessdate=2007-04-12 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070609113225/http://wason.library.cornell.edu/iaol/Vol.44/barlow_3.pdf |archivedate=2007-06-09 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; in the early 20th century, as well as experiments by [[Lin Yutang]] and others{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}}. Its original purpose was to aid telegraphers in looking up [[Chinese telegraph code]] (CST) numbers in use at that time from long lists of characters. This was mentioned by Wang Yunwu in an introductory pamphlet called "Sijiaohaoma Jianzifa" in 1926. Introductory essays for this pamphlet were written by [[Cai Yuanpei]] and [[Hu Shi]].

==How it works==
The four digits used to encode each character are chosen according to the "shape" of the four corners of each character, i.e. the upper left, upper right, lower left and lower right corners.  The shapes can be memorized using a Chinese poem that Hu Shi composed, called ''Bihuahaoma Ge'', as a "memory key" to the system:

7 for a corner, 八 (shape of '8' character) is 8, and 小 is 9.
|}

In the 1950s, [[lexicographer]]s in the [[People's Republic of China]] changed the poem somewhat in order to avoid association with Hu Shi, although the contents remain generally unchanged. For various reasons, his name was "unmentionable" at the time the new version was composed. The 1950s version is as follows:

Several other notes:
* A single stroke can be represented in more than one corner, as is the case with many curly strokes. (e.g. the code for 乙 is 1771)
* If the character is fenced by 囗, 門(门), or 鬥, the lower corners are used to denote what is inside the [[Radical (Chinese character)|radical]], instead of 00 for 囗 or 22 for the others. (e.g. the code for 回 is 6060)

There have been scores, maybe hundreds, of such numerical and alpha-numerical systems proposed or popularized (such as Lin Yutang's "Instant Index", Trindex, Head-tail, Wang An's Sanjiahaoma, Halpern); some Chinese refer to these generically as "sijiaohaoma" (after the original pamphlet) though this is not correct.

==Versions==
Over time, the Four-Corner Method has gone through some changes.

===First Version===
The first (revised) version was published in Shanghai in 1928. It was quickly adopted and popularized as a method for (among other things):
* Arranging and indexing Chinese characters in dictionaries
* Indexing Chinese classical and modern books, libraries, hospital and police records
* Chinese typewriters
* Military code making (for handling the characters quickly)

The Wang Yun-wu Da Cidian (Wang Yun-wu Ta Tz'u-tien) of 1928 was remarkable for its time, and although the pronunciations were very much in line with today's Standard Chinese, the lack of a phonetic index diminished its overall usefulness. The northern [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]] pronunciations were given in the "[[Gwoyeu Romatzyh|Guoyu Luomazi]]", devised by linguist [[Yuen Ren Chao|Zhao Yuanren]], as well as in Mandarin Phonetic System (MPS)  characters with a dotted corner for tone. It also delineated parts of speech, and all compounds were listed by the four-corner method as well. It was extremely modern. It used some arcane styles of characters as a citation form, and had a few errors and some important omissions.

The famed lexicographer and editor of ''[[Ciyuan]]'', Lu Erkui (Lu Er-k'ui), as well as other lexicographers, became early proponents of the Four-Corner Method. By 1931, it was used extensively by the Commercial Press to index virtually all classical reference works and collections of China, such as the Pei Wen Yun Fu and [[Siku Quanshu|Si Ku Quan Shu]], as well as many modern ones.

Hospital, personnel and police records were organized just like the biographical indexes and dynastic histories of former times. For a while (Nash, Trindex, 1930), it seemed that the Kang Xi Bushou (K'ang-hsi Pu-shou) [[214 Radical System]], left by the Qing (Ch'ing) Dynasty, was being replaced by the Four-Corner Method.

Internationally, Harvard and other universities were using the method for their book collections, and the [[Kuomintang|KMT]] Nanjing government (the main political and governmental body prior to 1949) seemed to have selected this numerical system as its standard. It was taught in primary schools to children in [[Shanghai]] and other locations during the late 1920s and throughout the 1930s, up to the outbreak of general war with [[Japan]] in 1937.
{{Expert-subject|Writing systems|date=November 2008}}
The Four-Corner Method was extremely popular in government education circles to promote spoken language unification until pronunciation-based systems became fashionable in the mid-1930s.

The first large-scale project to promote spoken language unification was in 1936: [[Wang Li (linguist)|Wang Li]]'s 4-volume Mandarin Phonetic System (MPS) entry, Guoyu Cidian (Kuo-yu Tz'u-tien). In 1949 it was re-edited into the MPS [[Hanyu Da Cidian]] with [[Kangxi Emperor|Kang Xi]] 214 radical index, and a small Four Corner dictionary was available as the Xin Sijiaohaoma Cidian of 1953. After 1949, limited use of MPS and the original Four-Corner Method continued under the People's Government, until the introduction of [[pinyin]] in 1958 and after. Today's Chinese dictionaries still contain MPS characters below each Pinyin class entry and sometimes in a phonetics chart in tables (Xinhua Cidian), while main entries are all in Hanyu Pinyin order. There is one all-sijiaohaoma small dictionary (Third Revision, below).

===Second Revision===
A minor Second Revision was made during and just after World War II. This was used by most postwar lexicographers including [[Morohashi Tetsuji]], who created his 12-volume Sino-Japanese dictionary, the [[Dai Kan-Wa jiten]] and included the Four Corner index among several other lookup methods. [[Oshanin]] (USSR) included a Four Corner index in his Chinese-Russian dictionary and in new China, an extraordinary project of the 25 Histories (Ershi wu shi) was published in the early 1950s with a Four Corner index volume containing the entire content.

Then, in 1958, with the introduction of [[Pinyin]], a small "Xin Sijiaohaoma Cidian" was produced by the Beijing Commercial Press, but the rapid Han character simplification of the following years made the small (30,000 compound) book obsolete in China. Overseas and in Hong Kong, it remained popular for a number of years as a high speed key to phonetic dictionaries and indexes. It was used by those partly literate in Chinese or—in some areas—unfamiliar with [[Standard Chinese]], especially Hanyu Pinyin.

Wang Yunwu produced a "Xiao Cidian" and "Zonghe Cidian" in the late 1940s. In Taiwan, "Zonghe Cidian" remains in print with an auxiliary section of rare characters. The telecode number, radical and stroke counts are shown for each character in a  convenient size, but a phonetic index is still lacking. Also, it's all in traditional Chinese characters, and it contains a lot of obsolete information. Still, it is convenient for reading old Republic-period materials and literature, and as a handy finder for pronunciations.

===Third Revision===
During the [[Cultural Revolution]], the Four-Corner Method underwent a radical Third Revision during the compilation of the experimental volume of the [[Chinese dictionary#Chinese–Chinese dictionaries|Xiandai Hanyu Cidian]], Commercial Press, Beijing, 1972. Another medium-sized dictionary, the [[Xinhua Zidian]], appeared with this index as well, but in the late 1990s the four-corner index disappeared from newer editions. Both works now use only the Pinyin main entry and multi-door radical index systems that make it possible to look up a character with perhaps a wrong radical (i.e., characters appear redundantly under different radicals) and the number of strokes and variant forms are greatly reduced, and many more people are literate and capable of transcribing Mandarin Chinese with Pinyin. The use of stroke counting and radicals puts memorization of the character ahead of sheer speed in handling it. This method is more supportive of mass literacy than classical scholarship or processing and filing names or characters for the majority in China today. The four-corner method is ultimately for readers, researchers, editors and fileclerks, not for writers who seek a character that they know in speech or recitation. In China today, a new version of the excellent small "Xin Sijiaohaoma Cidian", soft cover from Commercial Press, Beijing, has been available since the late 1970s, updated in several new editions and printings. It uses the Third Revision and enjoys some popularity.

==Current usage==
The main purpose of the original four-corner system today is in doing academic research or handling large numbers of characters, terms, index cards, or names. It is also used in computer entry, where a smaller list of items is created to browse from than with other systems. The [[Xinhua Zidian]] large type edition is available with a four-corner index for those whose failing eyesight precludes browsing and counting strokes.

In China today, many famous [[Kuomintang|KMT]] period reference books and collections with four-corner indexes are being reprinted for sale to scholars and those interested in Old Chinese language or historical studies.

==Summary==
{{unreferenced section|date=August 2013}}
The four-corner method, in its three revisions, was supported by the Chinese state for a while, and is found in numerous older reference works and some still in publication. The small Kangorin Sino-Japanese Dictionary by Yoneyama had a four-corner index when it was introduced in the 1980s, but it has been since deleted.

The four-corner method is not in common usage in China or Taiwan today, although dictionaries with it are available in many bookshops and libraries for those who need or desire to learn or use it. It is identified, in public opinion, with the time when many Chinese were illiterate and the language was not yet unified; more Chinese today use the dictionary to help them write, not read. But it is useful for scholars, clerks, editors, compilers, and especially for foreigners who read Chinese. In recent years it has achieved a new usage as a character input system for computers, generating very short lists to browse.

{{Redirect|Malcolm MacArthur|the Australian rugby union player|Malcolm McArthur}}

The phrase '''grotesque, unbelievable, bizarre and unprecedented''' was paraphrased from a comment by then [[Taoiseach]] (prime minister) of Ireland, [[Charles Haughey]], while describing a strange series of incidents in the summer of 1982 that led to a double-murderer, '''Malcolm MacArthur''', being apprehended in the house of the Irish [[Attorney General of Ireland|Attorney General]] [[Patrick Connolly]].

{{quote|It was a bizarre happening, an unprecedented situation, a grotesque situation, an almost unbelievable mischance.&lt;ref&gt;T. Ryle Dwyer, "Charlie: The political biography of Charles Haughey" (1987), ch. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
The corresponding [[acronym]], '''GUBU''', was coined by [[Conor Cruise O'Brien]], and both it and the phrase are still occasionally used in Irish political discourse to describe notorious scandals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oireachtas-debates.gov.ie:80/plweb-cgi/fastweb?query3=&amp;query7=&amp;query8=&amp;query6=&amp;stday=&amp;stmonth=&amp;styear1=&amp;styear2=&amp;endday=&amp;endmonth=&amp;endyear1=&amp;endyear2=&amp;query5=&amp;query4=&amp;query=GUBU&amp;query_rule=%28%28%24query1%29.le.DATE.le.%28%24query2%29%29%20AND%20%28%28%24query4%29%29%3ASPEAKER%20AND%20%28%28%24query5%29%29%3Aheading%20AND%20%28%28%24query6%29%29%3ACATEGORY%20AND%20%28%28%24query3%29%29%3Ahouse%20AND%20%28%28%24query7%29%29%3Avolume%20AND%20%28%28%24query8%29%29%3Acolnumber%20AND%20%28%28%24query%29%29&amp;operator=and&amp;sorting=none&amp;TemplateName=prehit.tmpl&amp;view=oho-view&amp;dbname=Debates&amp;query1=&amp;query2=&amp;numresults=25&amp;simplesearch.x=42&amp;simplesearch.y=14 Irish Parliamentary Debates] — usage of the term "GUBU" in [[Dáil]] and [[Seanad]] debates.&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2011 some ministerial resignations from the [[Government of the 30th Dáil|Government]] were described by its opponent [[Michael Noonan (Fine Gael politician)|Michael Noonan]] as "...bizarre, grotesque and to some extent unbelievable."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rte.ie/news/2011/0120/politics.html RTE news downloaded 21 January 2011] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110121024030/http://www.rte.ie/news/2011/0120/politics.html |date=21 January 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The murderer, Malcolm Edward MacArthur, born 17 April 1945, was a well-known eccentric character in [[Dublin]] social circles and never held a job, as he lived off his inheritance from the sale of his father's farm, after his death in 1974. However, as his money ran out, MacArthur decided to fund his lifestyle by robbery. First he decided to purchase a gun and responded to an advertisement by Dónal Dunne, a farmer in [[Edenderry]], [[County Offaly]], who had a [[shotgun]] for sale. However, having no transport and needing to get from Dublin to Edenderry, he decided to steal a car.

On 22 July 1982, a nurse named Bridie Gargan (aged 27) had been [[sunbathing]] in the [[Phoenix Park]] in Dublin during her time off work. MacArthur, intending to steal her car, bludgeoned her with a hammer. In the ensuing confusion, MacArthur drove off, leaving the dying Gargan on the back seat.

At this point a passing ambulance became involved and escorted MacArthur to the hospital, as the driver mistook him for a doctor because of a windscreen sticker which Gargan had. MacArthur later abandoned the car nearby. Three days later, having found alternative means to get to Edenderry, MacArthur visited the farmer Dónal Dunne and murdered him with his own shotgun after examining it. MacArthur then stole Dunne's car and drove it to Dublin. These two violent murders created a sensation, as unmotivated murder in Ireland, coupled with the youth and respectability of the nurse and farmer, was an unusual set of circumstances.

The [[Garda Síochána]] (Irish police) soon had a description of the person they wanted.

==Fallout==
MacArthur was acquainted with [[Patrick Connolly]], the then [[Attorney General of Ireland|Attorney General]], who was the chief legal advisor to the [[Irish Government]]. Both attended a match in [[Croke Park]], several days after the murder, and this led to a discussion between Connolly, MacArthur, and the then Garda Commissioner, Patrick McLoughlin, regarding the murder. (MacArthur even asked McLoughlin about the investigation of the "dreadful" murder.) On 13 August 1982, after a massive search, MacArthur was arrested on the private property of Connolly, and had been staying in the property for some time as a guest. Connolly, who had been getting ready for holiday, continued on his journey to the United States and did not give any interview to the [[Garda Síochána|Gardaí]] on the matter.

A serious effort was made to prevent the relationship between Connolly and MacArthur becoming public and indeed it was claimed that this was homosexual, something that was later discounted. Connolly was promptly requested to return to Ireland where he then resigned on 16 August. Haughey attempted to distance himself from the fiasco and described the event as "a bizarre happening, an unprecedented situation, a grotesque situation, an almost unbelievable mischance."

MacArthur admitted his guilt of the murder of the nurse. Because of this, he was not tried for Dunne's murder as the state entered a plea of ''[[nolle prosequi]]''. This led to a petition of 10,000 signatures to ensure MacArthur would be tried for his murder. This was unsuccessful and MacArthur received a life sentence for just one murder.

==After conviction==
In 2003 the parole board recommended that MacArthur be put on a temporary release program which would eventually lead to his release. [[Michael McDowell (politician)|Michael McDowell]], the then [[Minister for Justice and Equality|Minister for Justice]], who was also a member of MacArthur's defence team in the murder trial, decided that he would take no part in the decision for fear of a conflict of interest.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rte.ie/news/2002/0830/mcarthurm.html McArthur recommended for prison transfer] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041028020347/http://www.rte.ie/news/2002/0830/mcarthurm.html |date=28 October 2004 }} — [[RTÉ News]] article, 30 August 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2004 it was decided to keep MacArthur in prison, as relatives – including his mother – considered him dangerous.

MacArthur was allowed to spend Christmas Day 2005 with a relative outside prison and was also allowed a five-hour Christmas parole in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.breakingnews.ie/ireland/?jp=CWSNAUEYIDOJ Macarthur to be given temporary Christmas release]&lt;/ref&gt;

MacArthur was released from Shelton Abbey prison on 17 September 2012.

==In popular culture==
MacArthur's story inspired [[John Banville]]'s 1989 novel, ''[[The Book of Evidence]]''.

'''Henry Sweet''' (15 September 1845 – 30 April 1912) was an English [[philology|philologist]], [[phonetic]]ian and [[grammar]]ian.&lt;ref name="CCEL"&gt;''Concise Oxford Companion to the English Language'', as hosted on [http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1O29-SWEETHenry.html encyclopedia.com]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Kunitz /&gt;

As a philologist, he specialized in the [[Germanic language]]s, particularly [[Old English]] and [[Old Norse]]. In addition, Sweet published works on larger issues of phonetics and grammar in language and the [[language teaching|teaching of languages]]. Many of his ideas have remained influential, and a number of his works continue to be in print, being used as course texts at colleges and universities.

==Life and work==
Henry Sweet was born in [[St Pancras, London|St. Pancras]] in [[London]]. He was educated at [[Bruce Castle School]] and [[King's College School]], London.&lt;ref name="CCEL" /&gt;&lt;ref name=who&gt;'SWEET, Henry
MA, PhD, LLD', in ''[[Who's Who (UK)|Who Was Who 1897–1915]]'' (London: A. &amp; C. Black, 1988 reprint, {{ISBN|0-7136-2670-4}})&lt;/ref&gt; In 1864, he spent a short time studying at the [[Heidelberg University]].&lt;ref name="CCEL" /&gt;&lt;ref name="HW" /&gt; Upon his return to England, he took up an office job with a trading company in London.&lt;ref name="HW" /&gt; Five years later, aged twenty-four, he won a [[scholarship]] in [[German language|German]] and entered [[Balliol College]] in [[Oxford]].&lt;ref name="HW" /&gt;

Sweet neglected his formal academic coursework, concentrating instead on pursuing excellence in his private studies.&lt;ref name="HW" /&gt; Early recognition came in his first year at Oxford, when the prestigious [[Philological Society]] (whose President he was destined to become later on) published a paper of his on [[Old English]].&lt;ref name="HW" /&gt; In 1871, still an undergraduate, he edited [[King Alfred]]'s translation of the ''[[Cura Pastoralis]]'' for the [[Early English Text Society]] (''King Alfred's West-Saxon Version of Gregory's Pastoral Care: With an English Translation, the Latin Text, Notes, and an Introduction''), his commentary establishing the foundation for Old English [[dialectology]].&lt;ref name="CCEL" /&gt; He graduated, nearly thirty years old, with a fourth-class degree in ''[[literae humaniores]]''.&lt;ref name="HW" /&gt; Subsequent works on Old English included ''An Anglo-Saxon Reader'' (1876), ''The Oldest English Texts'' (1885) and ''A Student's Dictionary of Anglo-Saxon'' (1896).&lt;ref name="CCEL" /&gt;

Sweet, like his contemporary [[Walter Skeat]], felt under particular pressure from German scholars in English studies who, often state-employed, tenured, and accompanied by their [[comes|comitatus]] of eager graduate students, "annexed" the historical study of English. Dismayed by the "swarms of young program-mongers turned out every year by German universities," he felt that "no English dilettante can hope to compete with them&amp;mdash;except by Germanizing himself and losing all his nationality."&lt;ref&gt;''The Oldest English Texts'', ed. Henry Sweet (London: EETS, 1885), [https://books.google.com/books?id=85QUAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PR5&amp;dq=%22no+English+dilettante+can+hope+to+compete+with+them%22+Sweet+-wikipedia&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=c1WrTansB-mV0QHo5s35CA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CDgQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. v]. See further Richard Utz, ''Chaucer and the Discourse of German Philology'' (Turnhout: Brepols, 2002), pp. 67-69.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1877, Sweet published ''A Handbook of Phonetics'', which attracted international attention among scholars and teachers of English in Europe.&lt;ref name="CCEL" /&gt; He followed up with the ''Elementarbuch des gesprochenen Englisch'' (1885), which was subsequently adapted as ''A Primer of Spoken English'' (1890).&lt;ref name="CCEL" /&gt; This included the first scientific description of educated London speech, later known as [[received pronunciation]], with specimens of connected speech represented in [[phonetic script]].&lt;ref name="CCEL" /&gt; In addition, he developed a version of [[shorthand]] called [[Current Shorthand]], which had both orthographic and phonetic modes.&lt;ref&gt;Sweet, Henry: ''A Manual of Current Shorthand, Orthographic and Phonetic'' (Oxford: Clarendon, 1892). Online version from [http://cdm15457.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/ref/collection/p15457coll1/id/105 Rider University]&lt;/ref&gt; His emphasis on spoken language and phonetics made him a pioneer in [[language teaching]], a subject which he covered in detail in ''The Practical Study of Languages'' (1899).&lt;ref name="CCEL" /&gt; In 1901, Sweet was made [[reader (academic rank)|reader]] in phonetics at Oxford.&lt;ref&gt;''The Columbia Encyclopedia'', as hosted on [http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1E1-Sweet-He.html encyclopedia.com]&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Sounds of English'' (1908) was his last book on English pronunciation.&lt;ref name="CCEL" /&gt;

Other books by Sweet include ''An Icelandic Primer with Grammar, Notes and Glossary'' (1886), ''The History of Language'' (1900; 1995: {{ISBN|81-85231-04-4}}; 2007: {{ISBN|1-4326-6993-1}}), and a number of other works he edited for the Early English Text Society. Sweet was also closely involved in the early history of the [[Oxford English Dictionary]].&lt;ref name="HW" /&gt;

Despite the recognition he received for his scholarly work, Sweet never received a university professorship, a fact that disturbed him greatly, although he was appointed reader. He had done poorly as a student at Oxford, he had annoyed many people through bluntness, and he failed to make every effort to gather official support.&lt;ref name="HW"&gt;Howatt, Anthony Philip Reid; Widdowson, Henry George: ''A History of English Language Teaching''. Oxford University Press (2004), p. 198–207. {{ISBN|0-19-442185-6}} ([https://books.google.com/books?id=g2e7iw_F-ZcC&amp;pg=PA198&amp;lpg=PA198&amp;dq=henry+sweet+oxford&amp;source=web&amp;ots=UxyjKC7eIw&amp;sig=15i3VS0kBjnrGV60j_nuva9d9kQ#PPA198,M1 Online text])&lt;/ref&gt; His relationship with the [[Oxford University Press]] was often strained.&lt;ref name="HW" /&gt;

Sweet died on 30 April 1912 in Oxford, of [[pernicious anemia]]; he left no children.&lt;ref name=Kunitz&gt;[[Stanley Kunitz|Kunitz, Stanley]]; Haycraft, Howard: ''British Authors of the Nineteenth Century''. The H. Wilson Company (1936), p. 598. {{ISBN|0-8242-0007-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other interests==
In ''[[Who's Who (UK)|Who's Who, 1911]]'', Sweet gave his recreations as: {{Quote|Climbing, gardening, chemistry, alphabets, in boyhood; swimming, skating, European languages and literatures, in youth; riding, fishing, cycling, literary controversy, spelling and university reform, oriental languages and literatures, in middle age; sociology, spiritualism, music, literary composition, in old age—looked forward to flying: real flying, not with bags and stoves!&lt;ref name=who/&gt;}}

==Legacy==
Sweet has retained a reputation as "the man who taught Europe phonetics".&lt;ref name="HW" /&gt; His work established an [[applied linguistics]] tradition in language teaching which has continued without interruption to the present day.&lt;ref name="HW" /&gt;

A bibliography and ''Collected Papers'' were published by [[H. C. Wyld]].

In the preface to his play ''[[Pygmalion (play)|Pygmalion]]'', [[George Bernard Shaw]], after describing Sweet, stated that "[Henry] Higgins is not a portrait of Sweet, to whom the adventure of Eliza Doolittle would have been impossible; still, as will be seen, there are touches of Sweet in the play."&lt;ref name="CCEL" /&gt;

The Henry Sweet Society for the History of Linguistic Ideas (founded 1984) is named after him. It holds annual colloquia, and publishes the journal ''Language and History''.

'''Index maps''' are a type of [[finding aid]] that allow users find a set of maps covering their regions of interest along with the name or number of the relevant map sheet.  An index map provides [[geospatial]] data on either a sheet of paper or a [[Computer display|computer screen]].  In this way, a map acts as a kind of gazetteer, with the location (such as a call number) represented within a grid overlaying the maps surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Jensen | first = K.L. | title = Index maps for the digital age | journal = Information Technology and Libraries | volume = 23 | issue = 2 | pages = 81–7 | date = June 2004  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One important reason for this [[geospatial]] data is because political borders often change. Information is searched by coordinates, rather than the [[metadata]] for a particular country and region that can be entered into a catalog.  Additionally, in various institutions, maps are sometimes cataloged individually or as sets, resulting in various levels of specificity.

{{Muhammad|miracles}}
The '''Isra and Mi'raj''' ({{lang-ar|الإسراء والمعراج}}, ''{{transl|ar|al-’Isrā’ wal-Mi‘rāj}}'') are the two parts of a '''Night Journey''' that, according to [[Islam]], [[Muhammad]] took during a single night around the year 621 [[Common Era|CE]]. It has been described as both a physical and spiritual journey.&lt;ref name=enc&gt;{{cite book |editor1-first=Richard C. |editor1-last=Martin |editor2-first=Saïd Amir |editor2-last=Arjomand |editor2-link=Saïd Amir Arjomand|editor3-first=Marcia |editor3-last=Hermansen |editor4-first=Abdulkader |editor4-last=Tayob |editor5-first=Rochelle |editor5-last=Davis |editor6-first=John Obert |editor6-last=Voll |title=Encyclopedia of Islam and the Muslim World |date=December 2, 2003 |publisher=[[Macmillan Publishers (United States)|Macmillan Reference USA]] |isbn=978-0-02-865603-8 | page = 482}}&lt;/ref&gt; A brief sketch of the story is in [[surah]] [[al-Isra]] of the [[Quran]],&lt;ref name="alisra"/&gt; and other details come from the [[hadith]], which are collections of the reports, teachings, deeds and sayings of Muhammad. In the ''Isra’'', Muhammad traveled on the steed [[Buraq]] to "the farthest mosque". Traditionally, later Muslims identified the mosque as a location in the physical world, the [[Al-Aqsa Mosque]] in Jerusalem. At the mosque,  Muhammad led other prophets in prayer. He then ascended to the [[heaven]]s in the ''Mi‘raj''. The remembrance of this journey is one of the most significant events in the [[Islamic calendar]].&lt;ref name=times&gt;{{cite news|title=A night journey through Jerusalem|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/faith/article2279985.ece |date=August 18, 2007|accessdate=March 27, 2011|author=Bradlow, Khadija|work=[[The Times|Times Online]]}} {{Dead link|date=December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Islamic sources==
The events of Isra and Mi'raj are referred to briefly in the Qur'an. For greater detail, they have been discussed in [[Hadith|Hadith literature]], reported sayings of the prophet which supplement the Qur'an. Of the ''hadith'', two of the best known are by [[Anas ibn Malik]], who would have been a young boy at the time of Muhammad's journey of Mi'raj. [[Abd Allah ibn Abbas|Ibn 'Abbas]] is another source that challenges the usual description of the Mi'raj. He was also a young boy at the time of the journey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Colby|first1=Frederick S.|title=Narrating Muhammad's Night Journey: Teaching the Development of the Ibn 'Abbas Ascension Discourse|date=2008|publisher=State University of New York Press|location=Albany|isbn=978-0-7914-7518-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Qur’an===
{{religious text primary|section|date=April 2017}}
{{Islamic Culture}}

Within the Qur'an itself, surat [[al-Isra]], the 17th chapter. In it, the first verse briefly describes the Isra. There is also some information in a later verse and another surah, [[an-Najm]], which some scholars{{who|date=April 2017}} say is related to the Isra and Mi'raj.
{{quote|Glory to Him Who carried His beloved by night from the [[Great Mosque of Mecca|Sacred Masjid]] to the Furthest Masjid, whose precincts We have blessed, to show him of Our wonders! He it is Who is All-Hearing, All-Seeing!{{Cite Quran|17|1| translator= [[Tarif Khalidi]]}}}}

{{quote|Remember when We said to you that your Lord encompasses mankind in His knowledge. Nor did We make the vision We showed you except as a test to people, as also the accursed tree in the Qur'an.{{Cite Quran|17|60| translator= [[Tarif Khalidi]]}}}}

{{quote|And he saw him a second time,&lt;br/&gt;By the [[Sidrat al-Muntaha|lote-tree]] of the Extremity&lt;br/&gt;Near which is the Garden of Refuge&lt;br/&gt;When there covered the lote-tree that which covered it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The neither veered nor overreached.&lt;br/&gt;He saw some of his Lord's greatest wonders.{{cite quran|53|13|e=18|translator= [[Tarif Khalidi]]}}}}

====''Al-Masjid al-Aqsa''====
[[File:Israel-2013-Jerusalem-Temple Mount-Al-Aqsa Mosque (NE exposure).jpg|thumb|Thought to be referred to in the Quran as "The farthest mosque", al-Aqsa is considered the third holiest Islamic site, after [[Mecca]] and [[Medina]].]]

The place referred to in the Qur'an as "the Farthest Masjid"&lt;ref name="alisra"&gt;{{Cite quran|17|1|t=y|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt; ({{lang-ar|المسجدِ الأقصى}}, {{transl|ar|al-Masjidi 'l-’Aqṣá}}), from surat al-Isra, has been historically considered as referring to the site of the modern-day [[al-Aqsa Mosque]] in Jerusalem. The Jerusalem interpretation was advanced by the earliest biographer of Muhammad (ca. 570 - 632) – [[Ibn Ishaq]] (ca. 704 - 761/770) – and is supported by numerous ''ahadith''. The building of the Masjid in Jerusalem was not present during Muhammad's lifetime, and the term used for [[mosque]] (''masjid'' ({{lang-ar|مَـسْـجِـد}})) literally means "Place of prostration," and includes [[Monotheism|monotheistic]] places of worship, but does not lend itself exclusively to physical structures but a ''location'', as Muhammad stated "The earth has been made for me (and for my followers) a place for praying." Therefore, the phrase "Al-Masjidil-Aqsa" means that there was a place, but not necessarily a building, where Muhammad prostrated to God or [[Salah|worshipped Him]], in the "[[Al-Arḍ Al-Mubarakah|Blessed Region]]."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cmje.org/religious-texts/hadith/bukhari/008-sbt.php#001.007.331 Bukhari Volume 1, Book 7, Number 331]&lt;/ref&gt; When the [[Rashidun|Rashid]] caliph ‘[[Umar]] conquered Jerusalem after Muhammad's death, a prayer house was rebuilt on the site. The structure was expanded by the [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyad]] caliph ‘[[Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan]] and finished by his son [[al-Walid I]] in 705. The building was repeatedly destroyed by earthquakes and rebuilt, until the reconstruction in 1033 CE, by the [[Fatimid Caliphate|Fatimid]] caliph ‘[[Ali az-Zahir]], and that version of the structure is what can be seen in the present day.

Islamic scholars such as Heribert Busse&lt;ref&gt;Heribert Busse, "Jerusalem in the Story of Prophet Muhammad's (SAW) Night Journey and Ascension," [[Jerusalem Studies in Arabic and Islam]] 14 (1991): 1–40.&lt;/ref&gt; and Neal Robinson,&lt;ref&gt;N. Robinson, Discovering The Qur'ân: A Contemporary Approach To A Veiled Text, 1996, [[SCM Press]] Ltd.: London, p. 192.&lt;/ref&gt; believe that Jerusalem is the originally intended interpretation of the Qur’an. Muslims used to pray towards Jerusalem, but according to the following verses of their Quran, God changed this direction, the [[Qibla]]h, to instead direct to ''al-Masjid al-Haram'':
{{quote|And thus we have made you a just community that you will be witnesses over the people and the Messenger will be a witness over you. And We did not make the qiblah which you used to face except that We might make evident who would follow the Messenger from who would turn back on his heels. And indeed, it is difficult except for those whom Allah has guided. And never would Allah have caused you to lose your faith. Indeed Allah is, to the people, Kind and Merciful. We have certainly seen the turning of your face, [O Muhammad], toward the heaven, and '''We will surely turn you to a qiblah with which you will be pleased'''. '''So turn your face toward al-Masjid al-Haram'''. And wherever you [believers] are, turn your faces toward it [in prayer]. Indeed, those who have been given the Scripture well know that it is the truth from their Lord. And Allah is not unaware of what they do.|Quran|Chapter 2 (Al-Baqarah) verse 143-144&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.quran.com/2/143-144|title=Surat Al-Baqarah [2:143-144] - The Noble Qur'an - القرآن الكريم|work=quran.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===''Ahadith''===
From various hadiths we learn much greater detail. The '''Isra’''' is the part of the journey of Muhammad from Mecca to Jerusalem. It began when Muhammad was in the Great Mosque, and the [[Holy Spirit in Islam|Archangel Jibrīl]] (or Jibrāʾīl, [[Gabriel]])  came to him, and brought [[Buraq]], the traditional heavenly steed of the prophets. Buraq carried Muhammad to [[al-Aqsa Mosque]], the "Farthest Mosque", in [[Jerusalem in Islam|Jerusalem]]. Muhammad alighted, tethered Buraq to the [[Temple Mount]] and performed prayer, where on God's command he was tested by Gabriel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Momina|title=isra wal miraj|url=http://www.chowrangi.com/al-isra-wal-miraj-the-night-journey-and-the-ascension-of-prophet-muhammad-peace-and-blessings-be-upon-him.html|publisher=chourangi|accessdate=2012-06-16|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120615232240/http://www.chowrangi.com/al-isra-wal-miraj-the-night-journey-and-the-ascension-of-prophet-muhammad-peace-and-blessings-be-upon-him.html|archivedate=2012-06-15|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.duas.org/articles/merajarticle.htm|title=Meraj Article|work=duas.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was told by [[Anas ibn Malik]] that Muhammad said: "Jibra'il brought me a vessel of wine, a vessel of water and a vessel of milk, and I chose the milk. Jibra'il said: 'You have chosen the [[Fitra]]h (natural instinct).'" In the second part of the journey, the '''Mi'raj''' (an Arabic word that literally means "ladder"),&lt;ref name="tio-miraj"&gt;[https://archive.is/20130416011609/http://www.theismaili.org/festival/miraj Mi'raj — The night journey]&lt;/ref&gt; Jibra'il took him to the heavens, where he toured the ''[[Seven Heavens|seven stages of heaven]]'', and spoke with the earlier prophets such as [[Abraham]] ([[Abraham in Islam|ʾIbrāhīm]]), [[Moses]] ([[Moses in Islam|Musa]]), [[John the Baptist]] ([[John the Baptist#Islam|Yaḥyā ibn Zakarīyā]]), and [[Jesus]] ([[Jesus in Islam|Isa]]). Muhammad was then taken to [[Sidrat al-Muntaha]] – a holy tree in the seventh heaven that Gabriel was not allowed to pass. According to Islamic tradition, God instructed Muhammad that [[Muslim]]s must pray fifty times per day; however, Moses told Muhammad that it was very difficult for the people and urged Muhammad to ask for a reduction, until finally it was reduced to five times per day.&lt;ref name=times/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;IslamAwareness.net - [http://www.islamawareness.net/Isra/isra.html Isra and Mi'raj, The Details]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[About.com]] - [http://islam.about.com/od/otherdays/a/isra-miraj.htm The Meaning of Isra' and Mi'raj in Islam]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Vuckovic| first = Brooke Olson| title = Heavenly Journeys, Earthly Concerns: The Legacy of the Mi'raj in the Formation of Islam (Religion in History, Society and Culture)| date = December 30, 2004| publisher = [[Routledge]]| isbn = 978-0-415-96785-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Mahmoud| first = Omar| title = Muhammad: an evolution of God| url = https://books.google.com/?id=hqiQwmTDYBUC&amp;pg=PA56&amp;dq=isra+and+miraj#v=onepage&amp;q=isra%20and%20miraj&amp;f=false | accessdate = 27 March 2011| date = April 25, 2008| publisher = [[AuthorHouse]]| isbn = 978-1-4343-5586-7| page = 56| chapter = The Journey to Meet God Almighty by Muhammad—Al-Isra}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====The Mi‘raj====
There are different accounts of what occurred during the Mi‘raj, but most narratives have the same elements: Muhammad ascended into heaven with the angel Gabriel and met a different prophet at each of the seven levels of heaven; first [[Adam in Islam|Adam]], then [[John the Baptist]] and [[Jesus in Islam|Jesus]], then [[Joseph in Islam|Joseph]], then [[Idris (prophet)|Idris]], then [[Aaron]], then [[Moses in Islam|Moses]], and lastly [[Abraham in Islam|Abraham]]. After Muhammad meets with Abraham, he continues on to meet God without Gabriel. God tells Muhammad that his people must pray 50 times a day, but as Muhammad descends back to Earth, he meets Moses who tells Muhammad to go back to God and ask for fewer prayers because 50 is too many. Muhammad goes between Moses and God nine times, until the prayers are reduced to the five daily prayers, which God will reward tenfold.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=al-Tabari|title=The History of al-Tabari volume VI: Muhammad at Mecca|date=1989|publisher=State University of New York Press|isbn=0-88706-706-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; That again, Moses told Muhammad to ask for even lesser but Muhammad felt ashamed and said that even with lesser prayer times, his followers might not even perform diligently and said he is thankful for the five.

[[Al-Tabari]] is a classic and authentic source for Islamic research. His description of the Mi’raj is just as simplified as the description given above, which is where other narratives and hadiths of the Mi’raj stem from, as well as word of mouth. While this is the simplest description of the Mi’raj, others include more details about the prophets that Muhammad meets. In accounts written by Muslim, [[Muhammad al-Bukhari|Bukhari]], [[Ibn Ishaq]], Ahmad b. Hanbal and others, physical descriptions of the prophets are given. [[Adam]] is described first as being Muhammad’s father, which establishes a link between them as first and last prophets.&lt;ref name="Routledge"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Vuckovic|first1=Brooke Olsen|title=Heavenly Journeys, Earthly Concerns: The Legacy of the Mi'raj in the Formation of Islam|date=2005|publisher=Routledge|isbn=0-415-96785-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Physical descriptions of Adam show him as tall and handsome with long hair. Idris, who is not mentioned as much as the other prophets Muhammad meets, is described as someone who was raised to a higher status by God. Joseph, is described as the most beautiful man who is like the moon. His presence in the Mi’raj is to show his popularity and how it relates to Muhammad’s. Aaron is described as Muhammad’s brother who is older and one of the most beautiful men that Muhammad had met. Again, the love for Aaron by his people relates to Muhammad and his people. Abraham is described with likeness to Muhammad in ways that illustrate him to be Muhammad’s father. Jesus is usually linked to John the Baptist, who is not mentioned much. The physical descriptions of Jesus vary, but he is said to be tall with long hair and either red or white skin. Moses is different than the other prophets that Muhammad meets in that Moses stands as a point of difference rather than similarities.&lt;ref name="Routledge"/&gt;

Some narratives also record events that preceded the heavenly ascent. Some scholars believe that the opening of Muhammad’s chest was a cleansing ritual that purified Muhammad before he ascended into heaven. Muhammad’s chest was opened up and water of Zamzam was poured on his heart giving him wisdom, belief, and other necessary characteristics to help him in his ascent. This purification is also seen in the trial of the drinks. It is debated when it took place—before or after the ascent—but either way it plays an important role in determining Muhammad’s spiritual righteousness.&lt;ref name="Routledge"/&gt;

Many Muslim scholars like Saeed bin Khalfan Alkhalili, Nasir Kharousi, Farqad Alqazwini and Zakariya bin Khalifa Almahrami rejected the story of Mi'raj for not being mentioned in the Quran.&lt;ref&gt;https://nadwa.mara.gov.om/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/alajthad-alanshaaee-and-alalamtt-nassr.docx&lt;/ref&gt;

====Ibn ‘Abbas' Primitive Version====
Ibn ‘Abbas' Primitive Version narrates all that Muhammad encounters throughout his journey through heaven. This includes seeing other angels, and seas of light, darkness, and fire. With Gabriel as his companion, Muhammad meets four key angels as he travels through the heavens. These angels are the Rooster angel (whose call influences all earthly roosters), Half-Fire Half-Snow angel (who provides an example of God’s power to bring fire and ice in harmony), the Angel of Death (who describes the process of death and the sorting of souls), and the Guardian of Hellfire (who shows Muhammad what hell looks like). These four angels are met in the beginning of Ibn ‘Abbas' narrative. They are mentioned in other accounts of Muhammad’s ascension, but they are not talked about with as much detail as Ibn ‘Abbas provides. As the narrative continues, Ibn Abbas focuses mostly on the angels that Muhammad meets rather than the prophets. There are rows of angels that Muhammad encounters throughout heaven, and he even meets certain deeply devoted angels called cherubim. These angels instill fear in Muhammad, but he later sees them as God’s creation, and therefore not harmful. Other important details that Ibn ‘Abbas adds to the narrative are the Heavenly Host Debate, the Final Verses of the Cow Chapter, and the Favor of the Prophets.&lt;ref name="State University of New York Press"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Colby|first1=Frederick S|title=Narrating Muhammad's Night Journey: Tracing the Development of the Ibn 'Abbas Ascension Discourse|date=2008|publisher=State University of New York Press|isbn=978-0-7914-7518-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; These important topics help to outline the greater detail that Ibn ‘Abbas uses in his Primitive Version.

Some debates that Ibn ‘Abbas' narrative brings about have to do with his description of Muhammad’s encounter with God. Ibn ‘Abbas illustrates God as a human who touches and speaks to Muhammad as a human would. This is seen as an abomination and thus takes away Ibn ‘Abbas’s authenticity. In an attempt to reestablish Ibn ‘Abbas as authentic, it seems as though a translator added the descent of Muhammad and the meeting with the prophets. The narrative only briefly states the encounters with the prophets, and does so in a way that is in chronological order rather than the normal order usually seen in ascension narratives. Ibn ‘Abbas may have left out the meeting of the prophets and the encounter with Moses that led to the reduction of daily prayers because those events were already written elsewhere. Whether he included that in his original narrative or if it was added by a later translator is unknown, but often a point of contention when discussing Ibn ‘Abbas’s Primitive Version.&lt;ref name="State University of New York Press"/&gt;

==Modern observance==
The ''Lailat al-Mi'raj'' ({{lang-ar|لیلة المعراج}}, {{transl|ar|Lailatu 'l-Miʿrāj}}), also known as ''Shab-e-Mi'raj'' ({{lang-ur|شب معراج}}, {{transl|ur|Šab-e Mi'râj}}, {{lang-fa|شب معراج}}, {{transl|fa|Šab-e Mi'râj}}) in Iran, [[Pakistan]], [[India]] and [[Bangladesh]], and ''Miraç Kandili'' in [[Turkish language|Turkish]], is the [[Muslim holidays|Muslim holiday]] celebrating the Isra and Miʿraj. Some Muslims celebrate this event by offering optional prayers during this night, and in some Muslim countries, by illuminating cities with electric lights and candles. The celebrations around this day tend to focus on every Muslim who wants to celebrate it. Worshippers gather into mosques and perform prayer and supplication. Some people may pass their knowledge on to others by telling them the story on how Muhammad's heart was purified by the [[Gabriel|archangel Gabriel]], who filled him with knowledge and faith in preparation to enter the seven levels of heaven. After [[salah]], food and treats are served.&lt;ref name=times/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/islam/holydays/lailatalmiraj.shtml|title=BBC - Religions - Islam: Lailat al Miraj|work=bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wrmea.com/backissues/0191/9101056.htm|title=WRMEA - Islam in America|work=Washington Report on Middle East Affairs}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Al-Aqsa Mosque marks the place from which Muhammad is believed to have ascended to [[heaven]]. The exact date of the Journey is not clear, but is celebrated as though it took place before the [[Hegira]] and after Muhammad's visit to the people of [[Ta'if]]. It is considered by some to have happened just over a year before the Hijrah, on the 27th of [[Rajab]]; but this date is not always recognized. This date would correspond to the [[Julian calendar|Julian date]] of February 26, 621, or, if from the previous year, March 8, 620. In [[Twelver]] [[Iran]] for example, Rajab 27 is the day of Muhammad's first calling or ''Mab'as''. The al-Aqsa Mosque and surrounding area, marks the place from which Muhammad is believed to have ascended to heaven, is the third-holiest place on earth for Muslims.&lt;ref name="BloomBlair2009"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Jonathan M.

Many sects and offshoots belonging to Islamic mysticism interpret Muhammad's night ascent – the Isra and Mi'raj – to be an out-of-body experience through nonphysical environments,&lt;ref&gt;Brent E. McNeely, [http://www.bhporter.com/Porter%20PDF%20Files/The%20Miraj%20of%20Muhammad%20in%20an%20Asceneion%20Typology.pdf "The Miraj of Prophet Muhammad in an Ascension Typology"], p3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Buhlman, William, "The Secret of the Soul", 2001, {{ISBN|978-0-06-251671-8}}, p111&lt;/ref&gt; unlike the Sunni Muslims or mainstream Islam.

'''Kohi''' (or '''Koyi''') is a [[Sino-Tibetan languages|Sino-Tibetan]] language belonging to the [[Kiranti languages]] spoken in the [[Khotang]] district of [[Nepal]]. Like other Kiranti languages, it displays a fairly complex system of person-marking and stem alternations. No full description of this language exists, but Lahaussois provides some grammatical information, and stories have been archived at the [[Lacito Archive]].

Alternate spellings and names are Kohi, Koi Ba’a, Koyee, Koyi, Koyu.

==Geographical distribution==
Koyee is spoken in [[Sungdel]] (near Rawakhola headwaters) and [[Dipsung]] VDC's, northeastern [[Khotang District]], [[Sagarmatha Zone]], [[Nepal]] (''[[Ethnologue]]'').

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7971">In [[baseball]], a [[strikeout]] occurs when the [[batting (baseball)|batter]] receives three [[strike zone|strikes]] during his time [[at bat]]. Strikeouts are associated with dominance on the part of the [[pitcher]] and failure on the part of the batter.

[[Nolan Ryan]] has the most career strikeouts in [[Major League Baseball]]. During a record 27-year career, he struck out 5,714 batters.

The parentheses adjacent to an active player denote the number of strikeouts in the current season.

[[File:Citizen-Kane-Welles-Podium.jpg|thumb|''[[Citizen Kane]]'' (1941), starring and directed by [[Orson Welles]], has topped several international polls, including five ''[[Sight &amp; Sound]]'' critics' polls]]
This is a list of '''films considered "the best ever"''', so voted in a national or international [[Opinion poll|survey]] of either [[Film criticism|critics]] or the public.

Some surveys focus on all films, while others focus on a particular genre or country. [[electoral system|Voting systems]] differ from poll to poll: some surveys suffer from biases such as [[Self-selection bias|self-selection]] or skewed [[Demography|demographics]], while others may be susceptible to forms of interference such as [[electoral fraud#Ballot stuffing|vote-stacking]].

==Critics and filmmakers==
=== ''Sight &amp; Sound'' ===
[[File:Vertigo 1958 trailer Kim Novak at Golden Gate Bridge Fort Point.jpg|thumb|[[Vertigo (film)|''Vertigo'']] (1958) was ranked number one in the most recent ''Sight &amp; Sound'' critics' poll]]
{{main|Sight &amp; Sound|The Sight &amp; Sound Top 50 Greatest Films of All Time}}
Every decade, starting in 1952, the British film magazine ''Sight &amp; Sound'' asks an international group of film critics to vote for the greatest film of all time. Since 1992, they have invited directors to vote in a separate poll. 63 critics participated in 1952, 70 critics in 1962, 89 critics in 1972, 122 critics in 1982, 132 critics and 101 directors in 1992, 145 critics and 108 directors in 2002, and 846 critics and 358 directors in 2012.&lt;ref name="S&amp;S"&gt;[[Sight &amp; Sound#The Sight &amp; Sound Poll of the Greatest Films of All Time|The ''Sight &amp; Sound'' Poll of the Greatest Films of All Time]]

&lt;/ref&gt;

This poll is regarded as one of the most important "greatest ever film" lists.

'''''Living in Oblivion''''' is an [[Independent film|independent]] [[dark comedy]] film, written and directed by [[Tom DiCillo]] and starring [[Steve Buscemi]], [[Catherine Keener]], [[Dermot Mulroney]], [[Danielle von Zerneck]] and [[James LeGros]].  The film won Tom DiCillo the Waldo Salt Screenwriting Award at the 1995 [[Sundance Film Festival]]. The film was acclaimed by critics, and currently has a score of 88% on [[Rotten Tomatoes]]. It marked [[Peter Dinklage]]'s film debut.

== Plot ==
The film is divided into three parts, all of which concern the making of a low-budget movie featuring the same [[film director|director]], crew and substantially the same cast.

'''Part one''': Director Nick Reve ([[Steve Buscemi]]) is shooting a low-budget independent film in the middle of [[New York City]].  The catering crew are under-funded and apathetic, deciding not to replace a carton of milk that has been on the [[craft service]] table for a week.  The scene being shot is a difficult one: a young woman, Ellen, reproaches her elderly mother ([[Rica Martens]]) for not intervening when the father beat Ellen as a child.  However, on the set, just about everything that can go wrong does go wrong: shots are spoiled because of how the [[Microphone stand|mic boom]] is visible; the [[camera assistant]] fails to keep the shot in focus; Cora, the actress playing the mother, forgets her lines; and Nicole, the actress playing Ellen, becomes increasingly unfocused and careless. A dispirited Nick calls for a rehearsal without camera to refresh the actors.  However, when Nicole ([[Catherine Keener]]) berates herself for acting badly, Cora (Rica Martens) reassures her with a gesture that reminds Nicole of a similar gesture made by her own terminally ill mother.  Nicole is so upset by the memory that she turns in an unexpectedly passionate performance; and Cora, startled by Nicole's sudden intensity, is equally good.  Watching them, Nick becomes enthusiastic all over again.  Unfortunately, it was not captured on film; [[cinematographer]] and [[camera operator]] Wolf ([[Dermot Mulroney]]), who has been diluting the sub-standard coffee with the spoiled milk, was vomiting in the toilet throughout. Nick ruefully calls for another take.  This time, a sudden and insistent beeping sound distracts the actors.  Nobody can tell where it's coming from; and Nick flies into a rage, berating everyone on the crew and cast for their inadequacies.  He then wakes up in his own bed; the beeping sound was his own alarm clock.  He has dreamed the entire segment.  It is 4.30am; and he is due on set.

'''Part two''': Early the same morning, the film's lead actor Chad Palomino ([[James LeGros]]) is getting dressed in Nicole's hotel room.  They have spent the night together, and Chad suggests that they might get together again later; Nicole politely declines. Chad and Nicole arrive on the set separately. Nicole's character ''Ellen'' and Chad's character ''Damian'' have been in love for years but have never admitted it until the scene being shot on this day. Shooting the scene is made practically impossible by Chad's irregular acting.  He keeps changing his mind about where to stand and continually moves to places where he is either invisible or badly lit by [[Scenic design|scenic light]].  Nicole becomes increasingly frustrated by Chad's [[egomania]]; and, when he starts to stroke her head, she briefly loses her cool, then apologizes.  An irritated Chad demands a private talk with Nick. He tells Nick that he has slept with Nicole and makes out that it was she, not he, who had wanted to continue the relationship.  Desperate to keep Chad happy, Nick agrees that Nicole is not very good.  Nicole overhears this conversation on the [[Production sound mixer|sound mixer]]'s headphones.  Pretending to be contrite, she asks Nick if they can improvise a little; but, when they do so, she announces to everyone that, although she slept with Chad, she is not at all interested in him.  Chad loses his temper and quits the movie.  Relieved that he will no longer have to please Chad, Nick calls him a "[[Twinkie|Hostess Twinkie]] motherfucker" and a fight breaks out.  Nick beats Chad senseless and fires him.  He apologises to Nicole and confesses that he loves her.  They kiss—then Nicole abruptly wakes up, still in her bed, having dreamed the entire segment.

'''Part three''': Later the same day, the crew is setting up for a [[dream sequence]] in which Nicole, as Ellen, stands still while a [[dwarfism|dwarf]] walks around her holding an apple.  Nick claims to have learned a lesson from his own dream: That sometimes, "you just got to roll with things."  Nicole admits that she had a dream with Nick in it but doesn't tell him what happened.  Nick manages to keep up  his positive attitude despite the various mishaps that occur: The [[smoke machine]] fails to work, then it catches fire, then his senile mother Cora arrives on the set.  However, the ill-tempered dwarf actor Tito ([[Peter Dinklage]]) complains that the dream sequence is a cliché ("''I'' don't even have dreams with dwarves in them!") and walks off the set in disgust.  Nick's confidence collapses, and he announces that the movie is over. At that moment, his mother intervenes, grabbing the apple, moving to Tito's mark and announcing that she is "ready".  The crew scrambles to shoot the scene, and her manic performance injects fresh energy and conviction into it.  Nick is delighted and decides to keep the new dream sequence, and there is a tense moment while the sound mixer records 30 seconds of [[Room Tone|room tone]]. The entire cast and crew manages to remain silent, and during this moment they each daydream about different things. They go on to shooting the next sequence.

==Cast==
* '''[[Steve Buscemi]]''' as '''Nick Reve''', an intense and hopeful independent film director.  Nick is sensitive and thoughtful with actors and he tries to respect the status and dignity of everyone on the set, but sometimes the frustration just gets too much.  Nick's surname 'Reve' is derived from and pronounced like the [[French language|French]] word ''rêve'', meaning 'dream'.
* '''[[Catherine Keener]]''' as '''Nicole''', an actress playing the female lead in Nick's film.  Nicole is secretly in love with Nick.  Although Nick believes she is a fine actress, Nicole herself is fatalistic, believing that she will one day give up acting and seek work as a [[waitress]] or [[short order cook]].
* '''[[Dermot Mulroney]]''' as '''Wolf''', a talented but pretentious and prima donna-ish cinematographer and camera operator.  Wolf is in a relationship with the film's [[First Assistant Director]], Wanda ([[Danielle von Zerneck]]), although she breaks up with him at the beginning of Part three.  He is opinionated, sulky and obstinate.  His surname is ''[[Übermensch|Überman]]'', as shown on the [[clapperboard]].
* '''[[James LeGros]]''' as '''Chad Palomino''', the male lead in Nick's film, a major [[Hollywood]] star appearing in a low-budget movie to gain critical [[Praise|kudos]].  Chad is a selfish egomaniac; all of his suggestions about changing the [[Blocking (stage)|blocking]] are in fact covert attempts to place himself in the foreground of the frame, instead of in the background.  He turns out to be also a liar, admitting to Nick that he considers him a "loser" and that he only accepted the role "because I thought you were tight with [[Quentin Tarantino]]!" This character is sometimes assumed to be based on [[Brad Pitt]], but this isn't the case according to the director on the DVD commentary track.
* '''[[Rica Martens]] as '''Cora Reve''', Nick's Mother
* '''[[Peter Dinklage]]''' as '''Tito''', a frustrated dwarf actor who complains about his clichéd roles.
* '''[[Michele Carlo]]''' as a nurse.

==Background==
DiCillo got inspiration for the film from the frustrations he experienced when making the film ''[[Johnny Suede]]'', and his long struggle to make his next intended film, ''[[Box of Moonlight]]''.  ''Living in Oblivion'' was rejected by all producers but the actors and friends of the director felt so strongly about the project that they financed it.  Two of the producers, [[Michael Griffiths (producer)|Michael Griffiths]] and [[Hilary Gilford]], were given parts in the movie to thank them for providing finance.  Griffiths plays Speedo, the sound mixer; Gilford plays the unnamed [[Script girl]]. The film is divided into three parts. The first part was shot in five days and after DiCillo realized that it was too short to be a feature and too long to be a short he expanded it into a full feature film with parts two and three. The film title was taken from the hit 80's song by synth pop artists [[Anything Box]].

==Reception==
The film won Tom DiCillo the Waldo Salt Screenwriting Award at the 1995 [[Sundance Film Festival]]. The film was acclaimed by critics. [[Rotten Tomatoes]] retrospectively gives it a score of 88% based on reviews from 32 critics.&lt;ref name="RT"&gt;{{Cite web |title= Living in Oblivion |publisher= Flixster | work = [[Rotten Tomatoes]] |url= https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/living_in_oblivion/ |accessdate= 2016-10-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''map collection''' is a storage facility for [[map]]s, usually in a [[library]], [[archive]], or [[museum]], or at a map publisher or [[public-benefit corporation]], and the maps and other cartographic items stored within that facility.

Sometimes, map collections are combined with graphic sheets, manuscripts and rare prints in a single department.  In such cases, the expression "map collection" refers to the whole of the cartographic collection holdings.

==History==
Even in medieval libraries, maps formed part of the inventories. According to scholars of the [[renaissance]], maps were collected from the 15th century, either at the court or at naval academies to prepare for voyages of discovery. Over time, new techniques, such as [[copper engraving]], reduced production costs, and assisted in spreading maps more widely.

By the 17th century, [[Private library|private]] map collections were often the basis for public map collections. As early as 1571, for example, the Court Library in [[Munich]], [[Bavaria]], (now the [[Bavarian State Library]]) became the owner of the [[Fugger]] collection.  In 1823, the [[British Museum]] in [[London]] acquired the [[King's Library]], which had been inherited and greatly enlarged by [[George III of the United Kingdom]], and donated to the Museum by his heir, [[George IV of the United Kingdom]].  The King's Library included a collection of approximately 50,000 maps, plans and views, which are now housed at the [[British Library]] and known as the King's Topographical Collection.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.bl.uk/reshelp/findhelprestype/maps/kinggeorgeiii/kinggeorgetopocols.html |title=King George III Topographical and Maritime Collection |date= |work=British Library website |publisher=[[British Library]] |accessdate=5 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the development of public map collections, the geographical societies were important. They exerted great influence on the establishment and collection policy of such collections, or even stored their own collections at such institutions. So, for example, in 1680 [[Vincenzo Coronelli]] founded the ''Accademia Cosmographicae degli Argonauti'', which existed until 1718. In [[Nuremberg]], the ''Kosmographische Gesellschaft'' was established in 1740, while a namesake organization came into existence in [[Vienna]] in 1790. The ''[[Société de Géographie|Société de Géographie de Paris]]'', founded in 1821, was the first modern geographic society.

Especially in the 19th century, many map collections were either newly established, or merged with existing collections of catographic materials held by libraries under the responsibility of specialist librarians.

==Collection types and development==
*In academic libraries, map collections usually have a stock of old maps and [[atlas]]es. Often such libraries also acquire new copies of various official [[topographic map|topographic]] [[map series]], individual [[thematic map]]s, national atlases and thematic regional atlases. Academic library map collections usually also have cartographic literature.
*[[National Library|National libraries]] collect all the maps that fall within their territory and are submitted by the publishing houses of that territory in compliance with applicable [[legal deposit]] laws.
*General and regional libraries, depending upon their orientation, collect tourist maps and [[city map]]s, sometimes linked with [[travel guide]]s.
*Map publishers and map producing agencies (for example, Survey Offices) archive their own map production. These collections are in some cases not open to the public.
*Private collections are often set up thematically or regionally, so that private map collectors not uncommonly develop into renowned experts, and authors of map bibliographies, in their specific collection area.
*A collection of [[globe]]s can be considered as a special type of map collection.

==Documentation==
Newly published maps, like books, are recorded in national bibliographies. Thus, the title, author(s), [[imprint (bibliography)|imprint]] and [[ISBN]] of any recently published map are mentioned in official records. Additionally, various data specific to a map, such as [[scale (map)|scale]], [[map projection]], [[geographical coordinates]] and map format, are included in the records of that map.

Most academic map collection owners now index at least the most important parts of the collection in electronic catalogues that can be viewed online.

Older collections or private collections are often described in [[bibliophile]] catalogues. In such catalogues, at least representative parts of the collection are shown. Bibliophile catalogues provide evidence of the collection's stock that can be used in the event of theft.  Also, the use of a collection's rarities can thereby be noticeably limited, as in many cases the image and scientific description of the map is sufficient for the required purpose, and thus the original map is left undisturbed.

Holdings in archives are often not indexed on a single sheet by sheet basis, but on a basis under which a sheet can be found in the records only with the assistance of a [[finding aid]]. Archive staff, often not trained in cartographic matters, can be cautious in describing an unwieldy, and in some ways reputedly "foreign" document type.  For that reason, significant characteristics such as the projection and map scale of an individual sheet will often be omitted from an index to a map collection. These circumstances make it difficult for users of such indexes to search for a specific map in an archive, but still allow persistent researchers to make some 'discoveries'.

==Major map collections==

===Overview===
The authoritative guide ''World directory of map collections'' (2000)&lt;ref&gt;*{{cite book |editor1-first=Olivier |editor1-last=Loiseaux |title=World directory of map collections |edition=4th |year=2004 |publisher=Saur |location=München |isbn=3-598-21818-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; lists 714 map collections in 121 countries.  With few exceptions, the most valuable map collections are held in either Europe or North America.  There are also some map collections in South America, Africa and South Asia, but those collections are comparatively rare and of much lower value.
{{Expand list|date=February 2011}}

===Europe===

====Austria====
Indisputably the largest map collection in [[Austria]] is the Map Department of the [[Austrian National Library]] in [[Vienna]].  It has about 275,000 maps, 240,000 geographic-topographic views, 570 globes, 80 reliefs and models of fortresses, and about 75,000 volumes of technical literature and atlases,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.onb.ac.at/ev/collections/maps.htm |title=Map Department |date= |work=Austrian National Library website |publisher=[[Austrian National Library]] |accessdate=1 October 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101126194957/http://onb.ac.at/ev/collections/maps.htm |archivedate=26 November 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also a department of the Austrian National Library is the world's only public [[Globe Museum]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.onb.ac.at/ev/globe_museum.htm |title=Globe Museum |date= |work=Austrian National Library website |publisher=[[Austrian National Library]] |accessdate=1 October 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100904035846/http://www.onb.ac.at/ev/globe_museum.htm |archivedate=4 September 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; at the Palais Mollard, Vienna.

====Belgium====
The [[Royal Library of Belgium]] in [[Brussels]] has a collection of over 200,000 maps, atlases, cartographic books and globes. Most of these items relate either to [[Belgium]], or to its former colony the [[Democratic Republic of Congo]].

====France====
The [[:fr:Département des cartes et plans de la Bibliothèque nationale de France|Département des cartes et plans]] of the [[Bibliothèque nationale de France]] in [[Paris]] ranks among the top three worldwide collections of cartographic materials.  It holds stocks of atlases, maps, map series, globes, geography games, [[city map]]s, building plans and [[Cartographic relief depiction|relief maps]].

====Germany====
The largest map collections in [[Germany]] are those of the [[Berlin State Library]], the [[Bavarian State Library]] in [[Munich]] and the [[Göttingen State and University Library]].

Not currently publicly available is the collection of the publisher [[Justus Perthes]] in [[Gotha (town)|Gotha]], which is owned by the state of [[Thuringia]] and presently housed at the [[University of Erfurt]].

====Spain====
The [[National Library of Spain]] in [[Madrid]] has a collection of over 500,000 maps.

====Switzerland====
In [[Switzerland]], there are major map collections in several libraries. The map collection in [[ETH Zurich]]'s [[:de:ETH-Bibliothek Zürich|library]] is the largest, and specialises in [[thematic map]]s. The map collection of the [[Zentralbibliothek Zürich]] covers to a large extent the various official topographic map series and national atlases.

Located in [[Bern]] is the [[:de:Sammlung Ryhiner|Ryhiner Collection]], a former private collection of [[Johann Friedrich von Ryhiner]] with a focus on the 17th and 18th centuries.

====United Kingdom====
Major map collections are held at the [[British Library]] in [[London]], the [[National Library of Scotland]] (available free online),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=National Library of Scotland: Maps|url=https://maps.nls.uk/index.html|accessdate=10 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[National Library of Wales]] and the [[Bodleian Library]] at the [[University of Oxford]].

===North America===

====Canada====
[[Library and Archives Canada]] in [[Ottawa]] has a collection of some two million cartographic items.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/archivianet/020154_e.html |title=ArchiviaNet: On-line Research Tool - Maps, Plans and Charts |date= |work=Library and Archives Canada website |publisher=[[Library and Archives Canada]] |accessdate=1 October 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130611214119/http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/archivianet/020154_e.html |archivedate=11 June 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====United States====
The world's largest collection of maps is held by the [[Library of Congress]] in [[Washington, D.C.]]  It includes around 5.2 million maps.

The Osher Map Library located on the University of Southern Maine's Portland Campus has a large collection of maps, atlases, and globes.

===Oceania===

====Australia====
The map collection of the [[National Library of Australia]] in [[Canberra]] includes over 600,000 maps and 2,500 atlases.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.nla.gov.au/map/mapcoll.html |title=What we collect - Maps |date= |work=National Library of Australia website |publisher=[[National Library of Australia]] |accessdate=1 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Challenges ahead==
As with books in libraries, map collections now put more weight on creation of digital documents. These include maps and atlases on [[CD-ROM]] and [[DVD]] and in some cases the provision of [[Geodata]]. Such new forms of publication present map collections with major problems, as not just "mere" text and some inline images need to be kept, but very large amounts of data, up to several [[Gigabyte]]s, that may eventually be required to operate specialised [[geographic information system]]s.

Also, the long-term storage of cartographic data is an unresolved issue that is particularly important for archives.

The digitization of analogue map stocks also offers the opportunity to link library catalogues directly with the images (or at least with so-called [[thumbnail]]s). Also, digitally processed sheet indexes to individual sheets of map series allow for more targeted research from one's own workplace.

A '''middle-market newspaper''' is one that attempts to cater to readers who want [[Infotainment|some entertainment from their newspaper]] as well as the coverage of important news events. Middle-market status is the halfway point of a three-level continuum of journalistic seriousness; uppermarket or [[Quality press|"quality"]] newspapers generally cover hard news and down-market newspapers favour sensationalist stories. In the [[United Kingdom]], since the demise of ''[[Today (UK newspaper)|Today]]'' (1986–1995), the only national middle-market papers are the ''[[Daily Mail]]'' and the ''[[Daily Express]]'', distinguishable by their black-top masthead (both use the easy-to-carry [[tabloid (paper size)|tabloid]] paper size), as opposed to the [[Tabloid journalism#Red tops|red-top]] mastheads of down-market [[tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=JBSAAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT36#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Read all about it!: a history of the British newspaper] Kevin Williams; Taylor &amp; Francis, 2010; page 9&lt;/ref&gt;

'''MobileMe''' ('''iTools''' before 2002; '''.Mac''' before 2008) is a [[subscription business model|subscription-based]] collection of online services and software offered by [[Apple Inc.]] All services were gradually transitioned and eventually replaced by [[iCloud]] and the service ceased as of June 30, 2012, with transfers to iCloud available until July 31, 2012. Afterwards, all data was deleted, and the email addresses of accounts not transferred to iCloud were marked as unused.

Originally launched on January 5, 2000, as iTools, a free collection of Internet-based services for users of [[Mac OS 9]], Apple relaunched it as .Mac on July 17, 2002, when it became a paid subscription service primarily designed for users of [[macOS|Mac OS X]]. Apple relaunched the service again as ''MobileMe'' on July 9, 2008 at the [[Apple Worldwide Developers Conference#2000s|Apple Worldwide Developers Conference]] (WWDC) 2008, now targeting Mac OS X, [[Microsoft Windows]], [[iPhone]], and [[iPod Touch]] users.

On February 24, 2011, Apple discontinued offering MobileMe at its [[Apple Retail Store|retail stores]], with MobileMe retail boxes eventually removed from resellers as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url=http://appleinsider.com/articles/11/02/24/apple_discontinues_sale_of_mobileme_retail_boxes_as_overhaul_looms.html|title=Apple discontinues sale of MobileMe retail boxes as overhaul looms|publisher=[[appleinsider.com]]| accessdate=October 27, 2017|date=February 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, Apple stopped accepting new subscriptions for MobileMe. On June 6, 2011, Apple announced that a new service called [[iCloud]] would replace MobileMe sometime in the fall. At the [[iPhone 4S]] special event on October 4, 2011, Apple announced it would finally launch iCloud on October 12, 2011, to replace MobileMe for new users, with current users having access until June 30, 2012 (on that day the service would cease).

MobileMe was shut down on June 30, 2012, with user data available for retrieval until July 31, 2012, when the site finally closed completely.

==Services==
iTools and .Mac were designed primarily to provide Internet services for [[Macintosh|Mac]] owners. All members of iTools and .Mac received a @mac.com [[email address]], showing the services tied to the Mac hardware. However, with the release of the [[iPhone 3G]] in 2008, the renamed service, MobileMe, began providing Internet services for OS X, [[iOS]], and [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]]. Members of MobileMe were given a @me.com email address (though users of the current @mac.com email address could also continue to use those, with both domains being interchangeable with the same email account), were also no longer restricted to OS X software such as [[Mail (Apple)|Mail]] and [[iCal]], and they could access personal data from any computer connected to the Internet using the web interface at [http://www.me.com/ me.com] or a number of supported applications, including [[Microsoft Outlook]], as long as the user used version 2003 or later. Apple support for MobileMe was available via chat and telephone (the latter restricted to US/Canada users only).

===Find My iPhone===
{{main article|Find My iPhone}}
MobileMe allowed users to track the location of their iOS devices via the web portal at me.com. A user could see the device's approximate location on a map (along with a circle showing the radius of inaccuracy), display a message and/or play a sound on the device (even if it is set to silent), change the password on the device, and remotely erase its contents. An app was also released by Apple which allowed users to locate their iPhone from another device running [[iOS 4]]. The feature was first announced on June 10, 2009 and was included in iOS 3.0 as a feature for MobileMe users.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Eric |last= Slivka |date=June 8, 2010 |publisher=MacRumors |title=iPhone OS 3.0 Launching June 17th - MMS, Tethering in Some Countries |url=http://www.macrumors.com/2009/06/08/iphone-os-3-0-launching-june-17th/ |accessdate=January 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Find My iPhone was made free of charge with the release of iOS 4.2.1 software update on November 22, 2010 for devices introduced in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Jason D. |last=O'Grady |title=iOS 4.2 released; Find My iPhone free for iPhone 4 users (updated) |date=November 22, 2010 |newspaper=ZDNet |url=http://www.zdnet.com/blog/apple/ios-42-released-find-my-iphone-free-for-iphone-4-users-updated/8786 |accessdate=January 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Storage===
MobileMe had two different plans. The ''Individual'' plan included 20&amp;nbsp;GB of email and file storage and 200&amp;nbsp;GB of monthly data transfer. The ''Family Pack'' plan included 40&amp;nbsp;GB of storage split among one 20&amp;nbsp;GB individual (primary) and four 5&amp;nbsp;GB sub-accounts, each sub-account having its own email address, online storage, and being able to use all the MobileMe features. Family members also had a Shared folder in their [[iDisk]] with which they could share access to data among themselves. Both the primary account and sub-accounts had read/write access to this folder and were limited to the free space available in the primary user's iDisk.

''Individual plan'' was priced at $99, ''Family Pack''—at $149.

Members could buy additional storage in 20&amp;nbsp;GB or 40&amp;nbsp;GB allocations, however, sub-account storage could not be upgraded. In a family account, the amount of storage is designated per account.

Notes (from the Mail app on a Mac computer, and the Notes app on the iPhone) were synced via the MobileMe service, however were unable to be viewed or edited online. To Do lists (controlled from the Mail app and the iCal app on a Mac computer) were viewable and editable through the MobileMe website (under the Calendar tab), but were not viewable or editable on an iPhone. With the announcement of iOS 4 the sync for Notes over IMAP (including MobileMe) was implemented.

===Address book and calendar===
MobileMe maintained a synchronized address book and calendar feature using [[Push-IMAP|Push]] functions. When a user made a change to a contact or event on one device, it was automatically synced to the MobileMe servers and, by extension, all the user's other devices. Supported devices included the iPhone, [[Address Book (application)|Address Book]] and iCal on OS X, or Microsoft Outlook 2003 or later on Microsoft Windows. Subscription calendars in iCal on a Mac computer were not viewable on the online MobileMe service (although "Birthdays" was viewable online; as it gathered its information from [[Address Book (application)|Address Book]], rather than [[CalDAV]] or iCalendar (.ics) subscription calendars). Conversely, on the iPhone "Birthdays" from Contacts on the iPhone were not viewable on the Calendar app (nor any other method; except looking them up individually in Contacts. Birthdays Calendar was added on iOS 4.3), but subscription calendars were available to view in Calendar by adding them through Settings&gt;Mail, Contacts, Calendar&gt;Add Account.&lt;ref&gt;[http://support.apple.com/kb/HT3634 Copying Calendar subscriptions from iCal to your iPhone or iPod Touch], Apple Knowledge Base article HT3634, dated August 3, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[''MobileMe: Syncing calendar subscriptions and CalDAV calendars''], Apple Knowledge Base article TS1213, dated June 17, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://manuals.info.apple.com/en_US/iPhone_User_Guide.pdf iPhone User Guide pdf], page 93 "Subscribing to Calendars", dated July 10, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

===MobileMe Gallery===
MobileMe had a public photo and video gallery feature. Photos and videos could be uploaded in the [[web browser]] at me.com, synced by [[iPhoto]] or [[Aperture (software)|Aperture]] on OS X, or uploaded from the iPhone and iPod Touch. Users could also upload movies from within applications available on the Mac, including iPhoto and [[iMovie]]. MobileMe also provided the user with an email address that is used only for uploading photos and videos. All uploads by viewers of the Gallery (either by the iPhone or iPod Touch, me.com, or sent by the dedicated email address), were synced back to iPhoto or Aperture. Galleries could be made public or private, or could be password protected (but only through iPhoto or iMovie on OS X).

===iDisk===
{{main article|iDisk}}
MobileMe featured iDisk, an online storage repository accessible via a web browser at me.com, [[Finder (software)|Finder]] on OS X, various apps for iOS devices, or as a remote disk in Microsoft Windows. It also allowed sharing of files by selecting a given file using me.com/iDisk or the iDisk iPhone app, and then clicking a Share button that generated a unique link to this file, protected by password, that could then be shared by email. Another way to use iDisk to share several files easily was by placing them in the iDisk Public Folder, which could also be password protected.&lt;ref&gt;[http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1774 Using your iDisk to share files] Apple.com. Retrieved July 22, 2008. The iDisk can be used as a hosting server for your MobileMe website. Backups from [[Backup (software)|Backup]] can be stored onto your iDisk, making it easier backing up settings and more.&lt;/ref&gt;

===iWeb Publish===
Users of [[Mac&amp;nbsp;OS&amp;nbsp;X v10.5]] or later could use the [[iLife|iLife '08]], [[iLife|iLife '09]], or [[iLife '11]] application [[iWeb]] to publish websites hosted on their MobileMe account, either to a [[domain name]] that they controlled or to a page on the me.com website. Users without iWeb could also publish websites by placing files to the Web/Sites folder in iDisk. However, the web host didn't support any server-side language such as [[PHP]].

===Web applications===
MobileMe used [[Ajax (programming)|Ajax]] and [[Dynamic HTML]] to simulate the look and feel of desktop applications within the user's web browser. Applications on me.com included Mail, Contacts, Calendar, Gallery, Find My iPhone, and iDisk access, plus an Account section. Most of the me.com web applications were built on top of the open source [[SproutCore]] Javascript framework. Users could also configure features such as email aliases or [[domain name]]s for the [[iWeb]] Publish feature.

Supported browsers for me.com on both Mac and Windows were [[Safari (web browser)|Safari 3.1]] or later, and [[Mozilla Firefox|Firefox 3.5]] or later, while [[Internet Explorer 8]] and [[Internet Explorer 7]] were Windows-only. [[Safari (web browser)|Safari 3.0]], and [[Mozilla Firefox|Firefox 3.0]] would run the web applications, but were not fully supported.

MobileMe was accessible from [[Linux]] using Firefox 3 despite a warning that would be presented to the user upon entry. Success was also reported using the [[Konqueror]] browser on Linux, however this was not confirmed by Apple.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pranavchavda.com/2008/07/howto-apples-mobileme-on-linux/|title=Howto: Apple's MobileMe on Linux|last=Chavda|first=Pranav|accessdate=September 18, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===iChat/AIM===
MobileMe users could connect to the [[AOL Instant Messenger|AIM]] service with their @mac.com or @me.com accounts. MobileMe connections were secured by [[Secure Socket Layer|SSL]] encryption. In addition, [[iChat]] users using a MobileMe account could encrypt their chats with other MobileMe members using iChat. Users could also access the MobileMe Chat account on iOS devices using the free or paid-for versions of the [[AOL Instant Messenger|AIM]] app provided by [[AOL]], or any other iOS app that supported the AIM protocol.

===PC syncing===
Users who wished to sync their MobileMe data with a [[personal computer|PC]] had to download and install Apple's MobileMe Control Panel. To install, the user first had to download and install the latest version of [[iTunes]], and then install MobileMe Control Panel. After installation, the user signed into the control panel using their username and password, and could control sync settings for contacts, calendars, bookmarks, and iDisk settings such as public folder access, in a similar manner to the MobileMe preference panel built into {{nowrap|Mac OS X}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.apple.com/mobileme/features/pc.html|title=Apple - MobileMe also works great with your PC.|accessdate=July 11, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===MobileMe Mail Beta===
&lt;!-- this section is all wrong: I was a MM mail user from Apr.2009 – ie. BEFORE this?! (the main reason for getting MM was to get Apple's integrated IMAP f*cking *EMAIL* service, before any of the other services!!) All this should be under an expanded "MobileMe Mail" section --&gt;
The MobileMe Mail Beta was released on May 13, 2010. It included many new features such as photo inserting, font changing, wide screen views and much more. It was released as a final version on June 18, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.apple.com/mobileme/news/2010/06/the-new-mobileme-mail-available-to-all-members.html|title=MobileMe Mail. Now Available to All Members..|accessdate=July 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===MobileMe Calendar Beta===
&lt;!-- this section sounds wrong: I was a MM calendar user from Apr.2009 – ie. before this. And why a separate "Beta" section anyway: should surely be under the Calendar section?! --&gt;
MobileMe Calendar Beta was released on July 6, 2010. MobileMe Calendar Beta included a new web application at me.com with redesigned day, week, and month views, as well as a new list view to make scanning events easier. Performance was also improved. It also featured new sharing options that allowed invited users to edit a shared calendar. It supported invitations through RSVPs, which sent an email to invited persons, which they answered by clicking a simple link (they didn't have to be MobileMe members). It also supported CalDAV standard for compatibility with multiple devices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.apple.com/mobileme/news/2010/07/preview-the-new-mobileme-calendar-beta.html|title=Preview the New MobileMe Calendar Beta|accessdate=July 31, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, with these updates came some decreased functionality.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} The capability to publish iCal calendars as publicly viewable web pages was removed.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} Users wishing to view a public calendar had to then manually subscribe with a CalDAV compatible calendar device.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} Compatibility with Microsoft Outlook suffered too, since Outlook users could not sync their primary Outlook calendar to a MobileMe calendar anymore; the only way to integrate MobileMe with Outlook was then to have a MobileMe calendar linked in through CalDAV.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} This meant that a MobileMe calendar was always seen by Outlook as a secondary calendar, and alarms and notifications did not work.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

==Pricing==
The table below illustrates the pricing structure previous to Apple discontinuing purchases on June 6, 2011 as part of the move to iCloud. Current users were encouraged to use MobileMe services inside iCloud (account migration happening automatically anyway), but could continue to use their MobileMe services and access the me.com website until it was shut down on June 30, 2012 (although limited access beyond that date was available to download content). Users wishing to cancel MobileMe—thus immediately end all services—could gain full refunds if purchased within 45 days of June 6, 2011, or partial refunds if purchased 46 days or more; however, it was unclear whether this refund policy applied when the iCloud service launched in Fall 2011.&lt;!-- did the refund apply beyond this date or not? Needs checking! --&gt;

==Integration==

===Mac OS X===
MobileMe, like .Mac and iTools before it, was closely integrated with {{nowrap|Mac OS X}}. Having a MobileMe account extended the functions of many programs, mostly within the [[iLife]] suite. Most notably, any [[iDisk]] could be mounted as any other volume on the {{nowrap|Mac OS X}} desktop. Furthermore, it was possible to mount the public portion of another user's iDisk. This mechanism was one of the early ways to receive free software as part of .Mac. It was possible to queue files for upload to an offline iDisk, though they were only uploaded when the iDisk was mounted. iDisk commands were located in the "Go" menu of the [[Finder (software)|Finder]].

Additionally, any Address Book entries, iCal events and to-do entries, Safari bookmarks and [[Apple Keychain|keychains]], mail accounts, mail rules, mail signatures, and smart mailboxes could be synced with the iDisk, allowing easy synchronization between multiple computers. iWeb allowed users to create web pages that could be uploaded to iDisk and published. [[iPhoto]] could be used for one-click web-publishing of photo albums.&lt;ref&gt;[http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=306929 .Mac Support], Article dated December 19, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; iCal could be used to publish calendars to the web.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mac.com/1/learningcenter/Modules/dmCalendar_index.html |title=Sharing Your Calendar |publisher=Mac.com |date= |accessdate=December 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, [[Backup (software)|Backup]] software could be used to make backups to [[iDisk]] or local media.&lt;ref&gt;[http://support.apple.com/kb/HT3991 MobileMe: About Backup 3.2], Article dated April 13, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

With the prior .Mac service, the iPhoto, iMovie, [[GarageBand]] and iTunes libraries could easily be uploaded to any iDisk (subject to various licensing agreements).

===iOS===
MobileMe integrated with various applications on [[iDevices|iOS devices]]. This included iCal syncing with [[Calendar]], Address Book syncing with Contacts, Mail syncing across devices, Safari Bookmarks syncing across devices. Apple later introduced the MobileMe iDisk app on July 29, 2009,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=320654497&amp;mt=8|title=MobileMe iDisk app |publisher=iTunes.apple.com|date=July 29, 2009|accessdate=December 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; the MobileMe Gallery app on January 14, 2010,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/mobileme-gallery/id350223710?mt=8|title=MobileMe Gallery app|publisher=iTunes.apple.com|date=January 14, 2010|accessdate=July 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Find My iPhone app on June 18, 2010, that allowed mobile access to the Find My iPhone feature (initially only available for MobileMe users, later made free to all iOS device users).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/find-my-iphone/id376101648?mt=8|title=Find My iPhone app|publisher=Itunes.apple.com|date=June 18, 2010|accessdate=December 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; While initially only iPhone and iPod Touch apps, following updates, they were made ''universal'' app (compatible for iPhone, iPod Touch, and iPad). In August 2010, Apple introduced a feature that allowed users to stream music that's stored on their iDisk in the background from their device.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.michaelrobertson.com/archive.php?minute_id=324|title=Apple Quietly Enables Online Streaming To iPhones, iPads and iPod Touches|author=Michael Robertson|date=August 3, 2010|accessdate=August 18, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==URL access points==
There were [[subdirectory]] (private) and [[subdomain]] (public) access points to each MobileMe user's individual account functions. These provided direct web access to each MobileMe user's account, via links to each function directly. See list:

Private:
*''www.me.com'' – user login.
*''www.me.com/gallery'' – user photo/video Gallery albums.
*''www.me.com/mail'' – user Mail access.
*''www.me.com/contacts'' – user Contacts access.
*''www.me.com/ical'' – user Calendar access.
*''www.me.com/idisk'' – user iDisk folders access.
*''www.me.com/find'' – user Find My iPhone access.

Public:
*''gallery.me.com/'''&lt;username&gt;''''' – user's photo/video Gallery albums access (used with [[iPhoto]] and/or [[iMovie]]).
*''public.me.com/'''&lt;username&gt;''''' – user's Public folder (in iDisk) access.
*''web.me.com/'''&lt;username&gt;''''' – user's Website access (used with [[iWeb]]).
*''homepage.mac.com/'''&lt;username&gt;''''' – user's file sites access. &lt;!-- public/private/both?? + Also, was this link working for previous .Mac users following the start of MobileMe or just while .Mac was in operation? Someone please clarify under .Mac &amp; remove from here if necessary if this link did NOT work with MobileMe. --&gt;
*''ical.me.com/'''&lt;username&gt;'''/'''&lt;calendar name&gt;''''' – user individual calendar publishing. (Originally, many calendars could be published at the same time, but the later final iteration of MobileMe removed calendar publishing.)

==History==

===iTools===
[[Image:Itools logo.jpg|thumb|right|150px|iTools]]

The original collection of Internet software and services now known as iCloud was first called iTools. Announced and released at [[Macworld Expo]] [[San Francisco]] on January 5, 2000, iTools was made available free of charge for Mac users.

Services offered by iTools included the first availability of @mac.com email addresses, which could only be accessed through an email client (e.g. the Mail app); iCards, a free [[greeting card]] service; iReview, a collection of reviews of popular web sites; HomePage, a free web page publishing service; the first version of iDisk, an online data storage system; and KidSafe, a directory of family-friendly web sites.

iTools was primarily a Mac-only offering and provided only limited, discussion board-based technical support. However, some features of iTools were accessible via non-Mac platforms although a Mac was required to create an account.

For example, modifying HomePage content was possible using a web browser on Windows or via Linux.

Although the original version of iDisk used [[AppleShare]] IP for transport and required {{nowrap|Mac OS 9}}, it was eventually updated to use [[WebDAV]] technology and therefore opened up access to non-Mac operating systems. Apple even offered an application for use with Windows XP.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mac.com/1/idiskutility_download.html |title=iDisk Utility |publisher=Mac.com |date= |accessdate=December 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===.Mac===
[[Image:Dotmaclogo.png|thumb|left|upright|.Mac logo]]

As costs rose, most particularly due to iDisk storage space, the wide demand for @mac.com email accounts, and increasing support needs, iTools was renamed .Mac at Macworld Expo New York on July 17, 2002, as a subscription-based suite of services with a dedicated technical support team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.apple.com/pr/library/2002/jul/17dotmac.html |title=Mac announcement |publisher=Apple.com |date= |accessdate=December 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The new .Mac offered several tools to subscribers, including upgraded versions of HomePage, the personal web hosting service; iDisk, the online disk storage service; @mac.com, the email service provider offering both POP and IMAP protocols; and iCards, the online greeting card service. New services offered by .Mac included [[Backup (software)|Backup]], a personal backup solution that allowed users to archive data to their iDisk, CD or DVD; and [[McAfee]] [[Virex]], a [[virus scanner]] given to .Mac subscribers until June 15, 2005.

Apple announced on September 17, 2002 that more than 100,000 people had subscribed to .Mac since its launch earlier that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.apple.com/pr/library/2002/sep/17dotmac.html |title=Mac users |publisher=Apple.com |date= |accessdate=December 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Existing iTools accounts were transitioned to .Mac accounts during a free trial period that ended on September 30, 2002. This move generated a mixed reaction among Mac users, some believing .Mac was overpriced.&lt;ref&gt;"Net surfers are getting the message: Pay up." ''Seattle Post-Intelligencer Reporter.'' August 13, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

.Mac occasionally received new features. In October 2006, Apple launched an update to its .Mac Mail service whose interface was close to that of Mac OS X Mail. The new functionality was built on top of Ajax and provided drag-and-drop, a live-updating three-way split view, and the ability to resize panels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mac.com/1/webmail.html |title=Mac mail |publisher=Mac.com |date= |accessdate=December 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{nowrap|Mac OS X}} v10.5 Leopard used .Mac to provide [[dynamic DNS]] services for its [[Back to My Mac]] feature, a [[remote desktop software|remote desktop]] service.

On August 7, 2007, Apple's CEO Steve Jobs announced new features for .Mac, including a new Web Gallery feature, similar to a combination of the features of [[Flickr]] and [[YouTube]]. Each .Mac account now came with 10&amp;nbsp;GB of storage space that could be divided between email storage for an @mac.com email address and the user's iDisk. An account preference allowed the user to decide how much storage space to allocate to either service as they see fit. Users who wanted additional storage capacity could buy up to a total of 30&amp;nbsp;GB for a higher annual fee. The storage space for both email and an iDisk could be used in any way the user wanted, subject to the terms of the .Mac [[license agreement]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.engadget.com/2007/08/07/live-from-apples-summer-mac-product-press-conference/|title=Live from Apple's summer Mac product press conference|work=Engadget|access-date=2018-04-11|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

.Mac was also offered in a boxed version, available at stores and online (as a physical product). The box contained an activation code that was entered when registering or renewing a subscription.

===MobileMe===
Initial speculation about a new service to replace .Mac came in early June 2008, when Apple bought the me.com domain name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.doeswhat.com/2008/06/03/apple-to-target-the-self-involved/|title=Apple to target the self-involved|publisher=DoesWhat|accessdate= June 3, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; At WWDC on June 9, 2008, Apple announced that .Mac would be replaced by MobileMe. This was launched on July 9, 2008: mac.com was taken offline from 08:00 to 12:00 that day, and the MobileMe service went live between 20:00 and 02:00 (both [[Pacific Time Zone|Pacific Time]]).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.apple.com/support/dotmac Apple .Mac Support], [[Apple Inc.]]. Retrieved July 8, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; MobileMe was taken offline a short time later, leaving customers redirected to the MobileMe information page,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.apple.com/mobileme/ MobileMe information page].&lt;/ref&gt; where there was no option to log in. After several hours of infrequent service, MobileMe officially went live during July 11, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tuaw.com/2008/07/11/mobile-me-appears-to-be-up-and-running/ MobileMe appears to be up and running], TUAW. Retrieved July 12, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Several .Mac features were removed after the transition to MobileMe:
*Support for [[Mac OS X Tiger|Mac OS X 10.4.10]] or earlier (some features require [[Mac OS X Leopard|Mac OS X 10.5]] or later, such as iLife integration).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.macworld.com/article/134025/2008/06/mobileme.html|title=MobileMe: What you need to know|date= June 18, 2008|work=Macworld |accessdate=July 15, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*iCards.
*Web-access to [[bookmark (World Wide Web)|bookmarks]].

The launch of MobileMe was plagued by various issues. MobileMe, as a .Mac successor, was initially criticized during its launch for being unstable&lt;ref&gt;Mann, Merlin [http://www.43folders.com/2008/06/09/mobileme-macs-iphone-friendly-replacement MobileMe: .Mac's iPhone-Friendly Replacement], ''43 Folders''. Retrieved June 9, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; and for having syncing problems.&lt;ref&gt;Mossberg, Walt [http://ptech.allthingsd.com/20080723/apples-mobileme-is-far-too-flawed-to-be-reliable/ Apple’s MobileMe Is Far Too Flawed To Be Reliable], ''The Wall Street Journal''. Retrieved July 23, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; There were reports of users being unable to access any of the Mail functions of MobileMe. This was suspected to be related to the .Mac to MobileMe switch-over.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.macworld.co.uk/macsoftware/news/index.cfm?RSS&amp;NewsID=22112 MobileMe users seethe over four-day email outage] MacWorld.co.uk, Retrieved July 22, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The free trial of MobileMe inadvertently charged some Australian and European customers’ credit cards, leading Apple to issue refunds and extend the free trial to four months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tuaw.com/2008/07/22/apple-adds-another-month-free-for-uk-mobileme-trials/|title=Apple adds another month free for some MobileMe trials|last=Palmer|first=Robert|date=June 22, 2008|work=The Unofficial Apple Weblog| publisher=[[Weblogs, Inc.]]|accessdate=June 22, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/biztech/apples-mobileme-meltdown/2008/07/22/1216492418014.html|title=Apple's MobileMe meltdown|last=Moses|first=Asher|accessdate=July 27, 2008 | work=The Sydney Morning Herald | date=July 22, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the problems with switching over .Mac accounts and other issues, Apple created a status news page and revamped their support page.&lt;ref&gt;Status [https://www.apple.com/mobileme/news/ news page]; [https://www.apple.com/support/mobileme/ support page].&lt;/ref&gt;

Initial versions of the Windows MobileMe Control Panel allowed synchronization of corporate Outlook accounts with MobileMe. A mid-2008 update to the Control Panel removed the ability to synchronize Outlook to MobileMe when Outlook is using [[Microsoft Exchange Server]] Calendars and Contacts.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}} According to Apple Support, this is by design and is not a bug that will be fixed.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}} There was no support for synchronizing even standalone Outlook Tasks and Notes to MobileMe.

In May 2011, ''[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]]'' magazine reported that during the summer of 2008, after MobileMe had launched to mostly negative reviews, Apple's [[CEO]] [[Steve Jobs]] summoned the MobileMe team to a meeting in the Town Hall auditorium at 4 [[Infinite Loop (street)|Infinite Loop]]. After asking them "what MobileMe is supposed to do", when someone answered, Jobs reportedly shot back, "So why the fuck doesn't it do that?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fortune.com/2011/05/09/inside-apple/|title=How Apple Works: Inside the World's Biggest Startup|last=Lashinsky|first=Adam|work=[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]]|date=May 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an internal email sent to Apple employees on August 4, 2008, Jobs admitted that MobileMe was launched too hurriedly and “not up to Apple’s standards”.  He wrote that “it was a mistake to launch MobileMe at the same time as iPhone 3G, [[iPhone OS 2|iPhone 2.0 software]], and the [[App Store (iOS)|App Store]]”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2008/08/steve-jobs-on-mobileme-the-full-e-mail/|title=Steve Jobs on MobileMe: the full e-mail|last=Cheng|first=Jacqui|date=August 6, 2008|work=[[Ars Technica]]|accessdate=October 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On August 18, 2008, it was announced that MobileMe subscribers would be offered a 60-day extension in addition to the one-month extension previously offered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.computerworld.com/article/2532592/web-apps/apple-offers-mobileme-users-a-second-extension.html|title=Apple offers MobileMe users a second extension|last=Keizer|first=Gregg|date=August 19, 2008|work=[[Computerworld]]|accessdate=October 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===iCloud===
[[File:Apple iCloud.png|thumb|right|165px|[[iCloud]] icon]]From early 2011 onwards, MobileMe retail boxes began being removed entirely from sale at all [[Apple Stores]], with stock slowly being discontinued from other stores, and from June 6, 2011 users were prevented from subscribing or renewing to the MobileMe service via Apple's website. On June 6, 2011, at WWDC 2011, iCloud's release was announced for sometime in fall 2011, entirely replacing the MobileMe service which would be discontinued, however both would continue to be run concurrently for current MobileMe subscribers through June 30, 2012. Because of MobileMe's perceived public failings, Steve Jobs anticipated skepticism to his claim that iCloud "just works", and asked rhetorically, "Why should I believe them? They're the ones that brought me MobileMe!".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Sutter|first=John|title=iCloud: Revolution or the next MobileMe?|url=http://www.cnn.com/2011/TECH/web/06/07/icloud.reaction/index.html?iref=allsearch|publisher=CNN|accessdate=June 11, 2011|date=June 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 12, 2011, alongside the release of [[iOS 5]] and iPhone 4S, iCloud was released to new users, with current MobileMe subscribers being able to move over to iCloud either immediately or anytime before June 30, 2012 when MobileMe would be permanently discontinued (except for limited download abilities). In addition to MobileMe's email and calendar services, iCloud syncs files across multiple devices. As promised at WWDC 2011, Apple began the service during fall 2011, giving every user of either or both iOS 5 or [[Mac OS X Lion]] 5&amp;nbsp;GB of [[cloud computing|cloud]] data storage for the basic service free at the point of usage, with additional paid-for tiers for more data storage also being available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://apple.com/icloud |title=iCloud - Your content. On all your devices |publisher=Apple |date= |accessdate=December 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2011/06/06Apple-Introduces-iCloud/ |title=Apple Introduces iCloud |publisher=Apple.com |date=June 6, 2011 |accessdate=October 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; @me.com was retained as the default email domain address for new iCloud users. A year later, around [[Autumn|fall]] 2012, Apple started to sign-up new users to free @icloud.com email addresses, with previous @me.com users also able to continue using that email domain concurrently; as done on previous service changes.

==Discontinuation==
As a first step, Apple sent "30 days left" emails to all existing users of MobileMe on June 1, 2012, which they then followed with "7 days left" emails on June 23, 2012, advising users "Download your photos and files. MobileMe ends June 30. Remember to download your Gallery photos, iDisk files, and move your iWeb sites before that date."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pdf-archive.com/2012/07/17/x-days-left-download-your-photos-and-files-from-mobileme-before-june-30/preview/page/1 Apple 30/7 days left for MobileMe emails]. Retrieved July 17, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Then as previously advertised by Apple following the announcement of iCloud a year earlier, the main MobileMe service was discontinued on June 30, 2012, as most services were moved to iCloud and users were expected to have moved themselves over to the new service already by then, given they had a year's notice to do so. One exception was for MobileMe's Gallery and iDisk services, which still had limited downloading abilities remaining, with the online portal showing the banners "MobileMe has ended", with either "You can still download your files for a limited time." (on the iDisk page), or "Download your photos now." (on the Gallery page).&lt;ref name=digitaltrends&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.digitaltrends.com/apple/apple-shuts-down-mobileme-offers-limited-time-to-access-and-download-files/|title=Apple shuts down MobileMe, offers ‘limited time’ to access and download files|last=Bea|first=Francis|date=July 1, 2012|website=[[Digital Trends]]|accessdate=October 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The complete shut-down of MobileMe occurred on July 31, 2012, with a "MobileMe is closed" banner showing on the homepage, and a redirect link to iCloud.&lt;!-- date was not publicly published - see archived private Apple Support Online Chat PDF: http://www.pdf-archive.com/2012/07/06/live-chat-support-apple-mobileme-1/preview/page/1 --&gt;&lt;ref name=digitaltrends&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.macworld.com/article/1167448/mobileme_rides_into_the_sunset_by_sunday.html|title=MobileMe rides into the sunset on Sunday|last=Dove|first=Jackie|date=June 28, 2012|work=[[Macworld]]|publisher=[[International Data Group]]|accessdate=October 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/2012/07/sionara-mobileme/|title=Apple Finally Shutters Long-Suffering MobileMe — It's All iCloud Now|last=Bonnington|first=Christina|date=July 2, 2012|work=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]|publisher=[[Condé Nast]]|accessdate=October 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The iOS apps for Gallery and iDisk also ceased operating from June 30, 2012. MobileMe was later removed from the System Preferences in OS X on release of [[OS X Mountain Lion]] on July 25, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.imore.com/os-x-mountain-lion|title=OS X Mountain Lion|work=iMore|access-date=2018-04-11|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Built in 1845, the '''Museum Covered Bridge'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Gnis|1918786|Museum Covered Bridge}}&lt;/ref&gt; originally spanned the Lamoille [[River]] in [[Cambridge, Vermont]]. The trusses for the double bridge were assembled in a field next to the chosen site. Measuring 168 feet in length, with two vehicle lanes and a footpath (attached after its original construction), it is an impressive example of the engineering principles and bridge-builder’s craft practiced during the 19th century. The bridge was lighted by kerosene lamps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://shelburnemuseum.org/explore/buildings/transportation/covered-bridge/|title=Covered Bridge - Shelburne Museum|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1927 Flood the water rose seven feet above its floor.

The bridge replaced a ferry that existed in its place before, connecting two neighborhoods of Cambridge, Vermont &lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Marsh, Roberta. Cambridge Historian, author "Covered Bridges of Cambridge, VT", 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1940s, [[Electra Havemeyer Webb]] of Shelburne Museum, sought to preserve early American life and asked the VT Highway Department to help find a bridge worth preserving. When it was learned that the "Big Bridge" (as it was known at the time) was to be replaced, this "double-barreled" bridge with its walkway was too much to resist.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

The Museum dismantled the Covered Bridge in 1949 and moved it to the Museum grounds. The beams still bear the identifying numbers for reconstruction. By situating it above a man-made pond, extensive landscaping integrated the bridge into the grounds. The Covered Bridge served for many years as the Museum’s entrance, but when automobile traffic proved too taxing, the Museum relocated the entrance and retired the bridge from duty.&lt;ref&gt;Shelburne Museum. 1993. Shelburne Museum: A Guide to the Collections. Shelburne: Shelburne Museum, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;

The current bridge in its original place is The Wrong Way Bridge on State Route 15.

==Background==
While many associate [[covered bridges]] with New England, the first covered bridges in the United States were built in Pennsylvania. Artist and inventor [[Charles Willson Peale]] received the first patent for a covered bridge in 1797. While his project never came to fruition, seven years later the Town Board of Philadelphia voted to erect what would become the first covered bridge across the [[Schuylkill River]]; it was only enclosed by chance after a shareholder of the building company suggested covering it. Roofing a bridge protected the structure from severe weather while adding structural stability, and, as a further benefit, shielded farm animals from frightening views.&lt;ref&gt;Allen, Richard Sanders. Covered Bridges of the Middle Atlantic States. Brattleboro: The Stephen Greene Press, 1959.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1804, Connecticut inventor [[Theodore Burr]] engineered his design for an [[arch truss bridge]], also called a king-post arch design, and patented it in 1817. Shelburne Museum’s Covered Bridge is an example of Burr’s creative engineering. Because inventors receive royalties from bridge patents based on a bridge’s length, there was great incentive to devise ways of increasing a bridge’s possible span and the frequently used king-post design could only extend so far. Burr’s design, which bolted a single arched timber to the king-post braces, added such stability that not only did the king-post trusses become secondary supports but also the bridge’s possible reach greatly increased.&lt;ref&gt;Structural Analyses of Two Historic Covered Wooden Bridges. J. Bridge Engrg. Volume 9, Issue 6, pp. 623-633 (November/December 2004)&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Ovelgönne Bread Roll''' is the remaining part of a [[bread roll]] originating from the [[Pre-Roman Iron Age of Northern Europe]], which was found in 1952 during [[Excavation (archaeology)|archaeological excavations]] in a [[loam]] mine in the [[Buxtehude]] district Ovelgönne in [[Lower Saxony]], Germany. The piece of bread is the oldest surviving [[viennoiserie]] and formed bakery product from Europe. The find, along with a reconstruction, are in the permanent exhibition of the [[Archäologisches Museum Hamburg|Archaeological Museum Hamburg]] in [[Harburg, Hamburg]].&lt;ref&gt;Topic food, showcase No. 25&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Articus"&gt;{{cite book | last1 =Articus | first1 =Rüdiger  | last2 =Brandt | first2 =Jochen | last3 =Först | first3 =Elke | last4 =Krause | first4 =Yvonne | last5 =Merkel | first5 =Michael | last6 =Mertens | first6 =Kathrin | last7 =Weiss | first7 =Rainer-Maria | title =Archaeological Museum Hamburg Helms-Museum: A short guide to the Tour of the Times | series = Archaeological Museum Hamburg publication - Helms-Museum  | volume =103 | edition = | date =2013 | location = Hamburg | pages =42–43| isbn =978-3-931429-24-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Location of find ==

[[File:Ovelgönne Buxtehude Lehmkuhle.jpg|thumb|The location in June 2012]]

In May 1952 one of Helms-Museum’s staff, Willi Rühland, discovered a dark discoloration in a freshly cut clay wall on the north side of the municipal [[loam]] mine of Ovelgönne at {{coord|53.447161|9.739006|type:landmark_region:DE-NI|display=inline,title}}.&lt;ref&gt;Archaeological Museum Hamburg: Regional File Tangendorf: [[Gauss–Krüger coordinate system|Gauss–Krüger coordinates]]: 3549175; 5924200&lt;/ref&gt; The irregular pit had a depth of {{convert|150|cm|in}} and a width of {{convert|150|cm|in}}. The backfilling of the pit was irregularly mixed up with [[Sherd|shards]] of [[pottery]], pieces of [[charcoal]], lumps of clay, and stones, suggesting an Iron Age rubbish pit. Half down the pit, the remains of the charred bread was found.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite journal | last = Währen | first = Max | title = Vorgeschichtliche Brotreste aus der nördlichen Lüneburger Heide | editors = Helms-Museum, Hamburger Museum für Archäologie und die Geschichte Harburgs und dem Museums- und Heimatverein Harburg-Stadt und -Land e.V. | journal = Harburger Jahrbuch | volume = 19 | location = Hamburg-Harburg | year = 1996 | issn = 0722-6055 | pages = 11 | language = German }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Findings ==

[[File:SpitzweckOvelgönne.jpg|thumb|The surviving bread roll piece in the museum]]

The Ovelgönne bread roll originally had two tip-shaped ends. Due to its regular shape, it is categorized among the formed bakery products having a predefined shape. The strongly charred loaf of bread was aborted at about the half its length. The surviving part of the bread has a length of {{convert|35|mm|in}}, a width of {{convert|22.94|mm|in}} and a height of {{convert|11.44|mm|in}}, having a weight of {{convert|2.5|g|oz}} only. The point of the remaining end is missing. The colour of the surface is pearl grey to slate grey, the underside is grey to black. The top of the roll has a fine and slightly curved incision, which is designed to prevent tearing during the baking process. Nearly in the center of the resulting surface on the top is a {{convert|2|mm|in}} deep and {{convert|3.56|mm|in}} × {{convert|2.80|mm|in}} depression, which was pressed into it with a round tool at an angle of approximately 45°. A second hole was most likely also on the missing half of the loaf. The bread had no pronounced [[Pastry|crust]] and it was baked from a very finely [[Gristmill|ground]] and sifted [[wheat flour]]. A microscopic examination of the surface showed that the [[dough]] contained only remarkable small traces of [[wear]] fine [[Quern-stone|millstones]]. The dough itself was kneaded thoroughly and showed only very small [[porosity]], suggesting that neither a wild [[yeast]] [[fermentation (biochemistry)|fermentation]] nor a [[sourdough]] were used to leaven the bread loaf. Possibly for lightening of the dough, [[protein]] or [[fat]] was added. The baking process must have taken place in an [[oven]] on a stone surface which was good, but not completely cleaned of coal, as small charcoal remains have been reflected in the [[Pores (bread)|pores]] of the base. The bread was baked at an excessive top heat, compared to today's baking practice. Sandy deposits in the inner parts of the fracture surface indicates that the bread was broken apart before its discovery. A [[Radiography|radiological]] examination performed in [[Bern]] ([[Switzerland]]) showed that the superficial incision widened inwards slightly. The radiological images also showed  two, mysterious [[metal]] particles of {{convert|2.92|mm|in}} × {{convert|1.7|mm|in}} and {{convert|3.16|mm|in}} × {{convert|2.92|mm|in}}, embedded in the dough.&lt;ref name="Währen_1996_12-18"&gt;{{ cite journal | last = Währen | first = Max | title = Vorgeschichtliche Brotreste aus der nördlichen Lüneburger Heide | editor  = Helms-Museum, Hamburger Museum für Archäologie und die Geschichte Harburgs und dem Museums- und Heimatverein Harburg-Stadt und -Land e.V. | journal = Harburger Jahrbuch | volume = 19 | location = Hamburg-Harburg | year = 1996 | issn = 0722-6055 | pages = 12–18 | language =  German }}&lt;/ref&gt;

From his investigation of numerous archaeological bread finds, Max Währen receonstructed the original size of the complete bread roll, considering a 15% shrinkage by the charring to estimated {{convert|70|mm|in}} × {{convert|45.88|mm|in}} × {{convert|22.48|mm|in}}.&lt;ref name="Währen_1996_12-18"/&gt;

Due to [[Typology (archaeology)|typological]] determination of the ceramic vessel shards found in the pit, the Ovelgönne bread roll was [[Dating methodologies in archaeology|dated]] to the early [[Iron Age]], around 800-500 B.C.&lt;ref name="Articus"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Währen_1996_12-18"/&gt;

== Interpretation ==

[[File:S. Apollinare Nuovo Bread and Fish.jpg|thumb|Four loaves of bread with dipped in holes (left) on a mosaic of [[Basilica of Sant'Apollinare Nuovo]]]]

The circumstances and the location of the Ovelgönne bread roll in the pit is the subject of debate. Some authors suggest a [[cult]]ic [[Archaeological context|context]]. This is attributed to the halving of the bread roll before its deposition and the baked in metal pieces. Whether the metal pieces were deliberately baked in or accidentally fell into the dough is unclear. Währen questions whether "the Ovelgönne bread roll was a technical creation or a replica of a [[Sacred–profane dichotomy|profane]] or [[ritual]] object."&lt;ref name="Währen_1996_18-23"&gt;{{ cite journal | last = Währen | first = Max | title = Vorgeschichtliche Brotreste aus der nördlichen Lüneburger Heide | editor  = Helms-Museum, Hamburger Museum für Archäologie und die Geschichte Harburgs und dem Museums- und Heimatverein Harburg-Stadt und -Land e.V. | journal = Harburger Jahrbuch | volume = 19 | location = Hamburg-Harburg | year = 1996 | issn = 0722-6055 | pages = 18–23, 37 | language =  German }}&lt;/ref&gt; He sums up the importance of the object up as follows:

{{Quote|The Ovelgönne bread roll represents the oldest bread survived of Europe, having a predefined shape, in a Wecken shaped form of fine pastry probably having a ritual and religious significance, perhaps for this reasons it has been made in its delicacy and refinement previously unimaginable.&lt;ref name="Währen_1996_18-23"/&gt;}}

His opinion is based on the remarkable subtlety of the used wheat flour, which is close to grain sizes of modern flours, as well as the incision and the dipped in holes. Such dipped in holes are also known from an [[ancient Egypt]]ian find dating around 2000-1778 BCE as well as from [[mosaic]]s at the [[Basilica of Sant'Apollinare Nuovo]] in [[Ravenna]] dating to the 6th Century. However, the dipped in hole on the Ovelgönne bread roll is the earliest prehistoric evidence for this technique in Europe.&lt;ref name="Währen_1996_18-23"/&gt;

[[File:Plinio Corrêa de Oliveira como prior carmelita no sodalício Virgo Flos Carmeli.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Plinio Corrêa de Oliveira when prior of the third order of the Carmelites.]]
'''Plinio Corrêa de Oliveira''' (December 13, 1908 &amp;ndash; October 3, 1995) was a [[Brazil]]ian [[intellectual]] and [[Catholic]] activist.

Corrêa de Oliveira was born in [[São Paulo]] to Lucilia Corrêa de Oliveira, a devout Roman Catholic, and educated by [[Jesuits]]. In 1928 he joined the Marian Congregations of São Paulo and soon became a leader of that organization. In 1933 he helped organize the [[Catholic Electoral League]] and was elected to the nation’s Constitutional Convention by the "Catholic bloc", and at 24 was the youngest congressman in Brazil's history.  His view of the Church has been described as [[ultramontanism|ultramontanist]] and his political ideology [[anti-Communism|anti-Communist]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Domingues da Silva | first = Filipe Francisco Nives | title = Cruzados do Século xx: O Movimento Tradiçao, Família e Propriedade (TFP): origens, doutrinas e práticas (1960-1970) | place = Recife | publisher = Universidade Federal de Pernambuco | type = MA thesis | year = 2010 | chapter = O ultramontanismo pliniano | pages = 71–88 | language = Portuguese | url = http://www.repositorio.ufpe.br/handle/123456789/7910}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He assumed the chair of Modern and Contemporary History at the [[Pontifical Catholic University of São Paulo]]. He was also the first president of the São Paulo Archdiocesan Board of [[Catholic Action]].  Corrêa de Oliveira became concerned with what he saw as progressivist deviations within Brazilian Catholic Action, associated with the ideas of the French Catholic philosopher, [[Jacques Maritain#Political theory|Jacques Maritain]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = De Mattei | first = Roberto | author-link = Roberto de Mattei | title = The Crusader of the 20th Century: Plinio Corrêa de Oliveira | place = Leominster, England | publisher = Gracewing Publishing | page = 77 | year = 1998 | ISBN =  9780852444733}}&lt;/ref&gt; and attacked these changes in his 1943 book, ''In Defense of Catholic Action''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Quem somos nós?

Origins and our goal) | publisher = Associação dos Fundadores de TFP | language = Portuguese | year = | url = http://www.fundadores.org.br/servicos/qsomos/ | accessdate = 4 Feb 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the arrival of a new archbishop in São Paulo in 1944, Corrêa de Oliveira lost his position as diocesan head of Catholic Action and in 1947 his directorship of the Catholic weekly ''Legionário'', which he had supervised since 1935.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = De Mattei | first = Roberto | author-link = Roberto de Mattei | title = The Crusader of the 20th Century: Plinio Corrêa de Oliveira | place = Leominster, England | publisher = Gracewing Publishing | pages = 89–90 | year = 1998 | ISBN =  9780852444733}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1951 he founded the magazine ''O Catolicismo'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Della Cava|first=Ralph|title=Catholicism and Society in Twentieth-Century Brazil|year=1976|journal=Latin American Research Review|volume=11|issue=2|pages=34–35|jstor=2502548}}&lt;/ref&gt; together with the conservative bishops [[Antônio de Castro Mayer]] and [[Geraldo de Proença Sigaud]].  From 1968 to 1990 he wrote a column for the ''[[Folha de S.Paulo]]'', the city’s largest daily newspaper.

Corrêa de Oliveira's Catholic social activism found new targets with the advent of the [[National Conference of Bishops of Brazil]] (founded in 1952) and the [[Latin American Episcopal Conference]] (CELAM) (founded in 1955) supporting [[liberation theology]], and also with the [[Cuban revolution]] of 1959.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = De Mattei | first = Roberto | author-link = Roberto de Mattei | title = The Crusader of the 20th Century: Plinio Corrêa de Oliveira | place = Leominster, England | publisher = Gracewing Publishing | pages = 144–148 | year = 1998 | ISBN =  9780852444733 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  To put his ideas into action, he founded the Brazilian Society for the Defence of [[Tradition, Family and Property]] (TFP) in 1960.

Corrêa de Oliveira travelled to Rome for the opening session of [[Vatican II]], describing it as "a point in history as sad as the Death of Our Lord" in which the Church was faced by the generalized, co-ordinated, and audacious action of its internal enemies.  Oliveira was accompanied by members of the Brazilian TFP who brought twenty trunks of TFP literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = De Mattei | first = Roberto | author-link = Roberto de Mattei | title = The Crusader of the 20th Century: Plinio Corrêa de Oliveira | place = Leominster, England | publisher = Gracewing Publishing | page = 192 | year = 1998 | ISBN =  9780852444733 | quote = The latter [Sergio Brotero] had travelled earlier by ship bringing with him twenty trunks of Catholic propaganda material, which included copies in various languages of ''Revolution and Counter-Revolution'' by Dr. Plinio and ''On the Problems of Modern Apostolate'' by Bishop de Castro Mayer.}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the first session of the Council Oliveira provided a secretariat which served Brazilian bishops Antônio de Castro Mayer and Geraldo de Proença Sigaud and other bishops of the traditional faction, who ultimately formed the ''[[Coetus Internationalis Patrum]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = De Mattei | first = Roberto | author-link = Roberto de Mattei | title = The Crusader of the 20th Century: Plinio Corrêa de Oliveira | place = Leominster, England | publisher = Gracewing Publishing | page = 193 | year = 1998 | ISBN =  9780852444733}}&lt;/ref&gt; Corrêa de Oliveira's opposition to the direction of the Council continued, and in a 1976 addendum to his book, ''Revolution and Counter-Revolution'', he described Vatican II as "one of the greatest calamities, if not the greatest, in the history of the Church".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Oliveira | first = Plinio Corrêa de | title = Revolution and Counter-Revolution | place =  Hanover PA | publisher = The American Society for the Defense of Tradition, Family and Property (TFP) | year = 2002 | edition = First digital | page = 93 | url = http://www.tfp.org/books/rcr.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; His strong opposition led to him being described as a "revanchist" within the ultra-traditional faction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Faggioli | first = Massimo | author-link = Massimo Faggioli | title = Vatican II: The History and the Narratives | journal = Theological Studies | volume = 73 | page = 755 | year = 2012 | url = http://tsj.sagepub.com/content/73/4/749.abstract}}&lt;/ref&gt; However Plinio and those bishops drifted apart, as not all of them demonstrated obedience to the Chair of St. Peter, to which Corrêa de Oliveira was completely devoted to.

He served as president of the Brazilian TFP's national council until his death in 1995. His treatise, ''Revolution and Counter-Revolution'', inspired the founding of autonomous TFP groups in nearly 20 countries worldwide. An admirer of [[Thomas Aquinas]], he was the author of 15 books and over 2,500 essays and articles. His works include: ''In Defense of Catholic Action'', ''Revolution and Counter-Revolution'', ''The Church and the Communist State: The Impossible Coexistence'', ''Nobility and Analogous Traditional Elites in the Allocutions of Pius XII'', and many others.

'''Record Report''' is the official singles chart for [[Venezuela]] founded in 1990 which ranks songs based on [[airplay]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.recordreport.com.ve/nosotros/|title=Nosotros|publisher=Record Report|language=Spanish|accessdate=2012-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005 the [[Law on Social Responsibility on Radio and Television]] required radio stations to mandatorily include Venezuelan (both traditional and popular) music on their programming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/10/03/world/americas/03iht-venez.html|last=Forero|first=Juan|title=Chávez calls the tune on Venezuela charts|work=[[New York Times]]|date=2005-10-03|accessdate=2012-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before the law was passed, music that could be played by Venezuelan radio stations was not restricted by genre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5493972|last=Garcia-Navarro|first=Lourdes|title=Venezuela Moves to Promote Its Culture|work=NPR|date=2006-06-18|accessdate=2012-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Korherr received his doctorate in 1926 and worked for the {{Interlanguage link multi|Reich Statistical Office|de|3=Statistisches Reichsamt}} before [[Hitler's rise to power]]. He served as chairman&lt;!--Vorsitzender--&gt; of the Bavarian anti-separatist ''Reich und Heimat'' Committee in 1930-33, and became member of the Catholic [[Bavarian People's Party]]. On 1 January 1934 his department was taken over by the Bavarian Statistical Office, and he was transferred there.&lt;ref name="Götz/angaben"/&gt;

In 1935-40 Korherr was Director of the Statistical Office of the city of [[Würzburg]].&lt;ref name="Götz/angaben"&gt;{{cite book |authors=Götz Aly, Karl Heinz Roth |title=Die restlose Erfassung: Volkszählen, Identifizieren, Aussondern im Nationalsozialismus |location=Frankfurt/M. |year=2000 |ISBN=3-596-14767-0 |publisher=Fischer Taschenbuch Verlag |pages=40–43}} ''(also in)'' {{cite book |author=Jutta Wietog |title=Volkszählungen unter dem Nationalsozialismus |location=Berlin |year=2002 |ISBN=3-428-10384-X |pages=209–237 |publisher=Duncker &amp; Humblot |via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the [[invasion of Poland]] at the onset of World War II, on 9 December 1940 Himmler brought Korherr to [[Reichsführer-SS]] office, to study the progress of resettlement for him.&lt;ref name="Götz/info"/&gt; Korherr's incredible problems with the SS began only when the German advance on [[Eastern Front (World War II)|the Russian front]] had been halted, resulting in the most damning statistic often attributed to him.&lt;ref name="Götz/info"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U-GhQrKj9vQC&amp;lpg=PA31&amp;vq=Korherr%2BErlangen&amp;pg=PA31#v=snippet&amp;q=Korherr+Erlangen&amp;f=false |pages=31–32 |title=The Nazi Census: Identification and Control in the Third Reich |authors=Götz Aly, Karl Heinz Roth |translator=Edwin Black, Assenka Oksiloff |publisher=Temple University Press |year=2004 |ISBN=1592132596 |via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Korherr Report==
During World War II Korherr was commissioned by [[Heinrich Himmler]] to calculate the number of Jews in Europe subject to "special treatment" (''[[Sonderbehandlung]]'', an SS [[code name]] for [[mass murder]]) from 1937 to December 1942. Korherr completed his [[Korherr Report]] in January 1943 and handed it over to ''[[SS-Obersturmbannfuhrer]]'' Dr. [[Rudolf Brandt]] on the 23 March of that year. It was a 16-page document on the progress of [[the Holocaust]] as reflected in the dwindling numbers of Jews in Germany and [[German-occupied Europe]]. It included a seven-page supplement about the deportations in the first three months of 1943.&lt;ref name="Hilberg"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Destruction of the European Jews |author=[[Raul Hilberg]] |publisher=[[Yale University Press]] |year=2003 |ISBN=0300095929 |pages=1304–1305 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HinIpmliz2MC&amp;lpg=PA1304&amp;vq=Richard%2BKorherr&amp;pg=PA1304#v=snippet&amp;q=Richard+Korherr&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report was released under the title ''Die Endlösung der Judenfrage'' ({{lang-en|the [[Final Solution]] to the Jewish Question}}). Korherr calculated that the number had fallen by 4 million, of whom 1,274,166 victims were delivered to camps for 'special treatment'. The exacting number of 1,274,166 Jews appeared in the [[Höfle Telegram|Telegram]] sent by ''[[SS-Sturmbannführer]]'' [[Hermann Höfle]] on 11 January 1943 suggesting that both of them used data collected by the German Transport Authority. Himmler returned the document to its author and demanded a more [[euphemism|innocuous word]] in place of the ''"[[Sonderbehandlung]]"'' to divert and obscure the crimes. Korherr replaced the phrase with ''"Durchgeschleust"'' suggesting that the quoted numbers of Jews had "passed through" the so-called [[Nazi concentration camps#Types of camps|''Durchgangslager'' (transit camps)]]. A summary of his report was delivered to Adolf Hitler by Brandt.&lt;ref name="O'Neil"&gt;{{cite book |author=Dr. [[Robin O'Neil]] |title=The Rabka Four. Instruments of Genocide and Grand Larceny.

In 1945-46 he was under so-called '[[Denazification|automatic arrest]]' as state functionary,{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} however he did not face the [[Nuremberg Trials]], because his Report was not revealed and he later claimed he never heard about the extermination before 1945.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ernst Klee]], ''Das Personenlexikon zum Dritten Reich'', Frankfurt 2005, {{ISBN|3-596-16048-0}}, p. 331.&lt;/ref&gt;

Later Korherr worked at the [[Federal Ministry of Finance (Germany)|Federal Ministry of Finance]] in [[West Germany]]. He also lectured at the [[University of Erlangen-Nuremberg]] in 1959–62. Korherr died in the city of [[Braunschweig]], [[Lower Saxony]], on 24 November 1989 at the age of 86.

{{refimprove|date=March 2018}}
'''''SPQR''''' is an [[initialism]] of a phrase in {{Lang-la|[[wikt:senatus|'''S'''enātus]] [[wikt:populus|'''P'''opulus]][[wikt:-que|'''q'''ue]] [[wikt:romanus|'''R'''ōmānus]]}} ("The [[Roman Senate]] and People", or more freely as "The Senate and People of Rome"; {{IPA-la|sɛˈnaː.tʊs pɔpʊˈlʊs.kᶣɛ roːˈmaː.nʊs|classical}}), referring to the [[government]] of the ancient [[Roman Republic]]. It appears on [[Roman currency]], at the end of documents made public by inscription in stone or metal, and in dedications of monuments and public works.

The phrase commonly appears in the Roman political, legal, and historical literature, such as the speeches of [[Cicero]] and ''[[Ab Urbe Condita Libri (Livy)|Ab Urbe Condita Libri]]'' ("Books from the Founding of the City") of [[Livy]].

Today this initialism is used as an official emblem of the modern-day [[comune]] ([[municipality]]) of [[Rome]].

==Translation==
SPQR: '''''S'''enātus '''P'''opulus'''q'''ue '''R'''ōmānus''.
In [[Latin]], ''[[wikt:senatus|Senātus]]'' is a [[nominative]] singular noun meaning "[[Roman Senate|Senate]]". ''[[wikt:populus|Populus]][[wikt:-que|que]]'' is compounded from the nominative noun ''[[wikt:populus|Populus]]'', "the People", and ''[[wikt:-que|-que]]'', an [[enclitic|enclitic particle]] meaning "and" which [[Conjunction (grammar)|connects]] the two nominative nouns. The last word, ''[[wikt:romanus|Rōmānus]]'' ("[[wikt:Rome|Roman]]") is an [[adjective]] modifying the whole of ''[[wikt:senatus|Senātus]] [[wikt:populus|Populus]]que'': the "Roman Senate and People", taken as a whole.&lt;ref name="mrdonn" /&gt;

Thus, the phrase is translated literally as "The Roman Senate and People", or more freely as "The Senate and People of Rome".&lt;ref name="mrdonn"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rome.mrdonn.org/SPQR.html|title=SPQR - Ancient Rome for Kids|website=rome.mrdonn.org|access-date=2018-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical context==
{{Refimprove section|date=February 2018}}
The title's date of establishment is unknown, but it first appears in inscriptions of the Late Republic, from c. 80 BC onwards. Previously, the official name of the Roman state, as evidenced on coins, was simply ''ROMA''. The abbreviation last appears on coins of [[Constantine the Great]] (ruled 312–337 AD), the first Roman emperor to support [[Christianity]].{{fact|date=March 2018}}

The two legal entities mentioned, ''Senātus'' and the ''Populus Rōmānus'', are sovereign when combined. However, where ''populus'' is sovereign alone, ''Senātus'' is not. Under the [[Roman Kingdom]], neither entity was sovereign. The phrase, therefore, can be dated to no earlier than the foundation of the Republic.{{fact|date=March 2018}}

This signature continued in use under the [[Roman Empire]]. The emperors were considered the ''[[de jure]]'' representatives of the people even though the ''[[Senatus consultum|senātūs consulta]]'', or decrees of the Senate, were made at the ''[[de facto]]'' pleasure of the emperor.{{fact|date=March 2018}}

''Populus Rōmānus'' in Roman literature is a phrase meaning the government of the People. When the Romans named governments of other countries, they used populus in the singular or plural, such as ''populī Prīscōrum Latīnōrum'', "the governments of the Old Latins". ''Rōmānus'' is the established adjective used to distinguish the Romans, as in ''cīvis Rōmānus'', "[[Roman citizenship|Roman citizen]]".{{fact|date=March 2018}}

The Roman people appear very often in law and history in such phrases as ''dignitās'', ''maiestās'', ''auctoritās'', ''lībertās populī Rōmānī'', the "dignity, majesty, authority, freedom of the Roman people". They were a ''populus līber'', "a free people". There was an ''exercitus, imperium, iudicia, honorēs, consulēs, voluntās'' of this same ''populus'': "the army, rule, judgments, offices, consuls and will of the Roman people". They appear in early Latin as ''Popolus'' and ''Poplus'', so the habit of thinking of themselves as free and sovereign was quite ingrained.{{fact|date=March 2018}}

The Romans believed that all authority came from the people. It could be said that similar language seen in more modern political and social revolutions directly comes from this usage. People in this sense meant the whole government. The latter, however, was essentially divided into the aristocratic Senate, whose will was executed by the [[Roman consul|consul]]s and [[praetor]]s, and the ''comitia centuriāta'', "committee of the centuries", whose will came to be safeguarded by the [[Tribune]]s.{{fact|date=March 2018}}

One of the ways the emperor [[Commodus]] (180–192) paid for his donatives and mass entertainments was to tax the senatorial order, and on many inscriptions, the traditional order is provocatively reversed (''Populus Senatusque...'').{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

Beginning in 1184, the [[Commune of Rome]] struck coins in the name of the SENATVS P Q R.  From 1414 until 1517, the Roman Senate struck coins with a shield inscribed SPQR.&lt;ref&gt;Monete e Zecche Medievalli Italiane, Elio Biaggi, coins 2081 and 2141&lt;/ref&gt;

During [[Fascist Italy (1922–43)|the regime]] of [[Benito Mussolini]], SPQR was emblazoned on a number of public buildings and [[manhole cover]]s in an attempt to promote his dictatorship as a "[[Italian Empire|New Roman Empire]]".{{fact|date=March 2018}}

==Modern use==
Even in contemporary usage, SPQR is still used as the municipal symbol of the city of Rome.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}

''SPQx'' is sometimes used as an assertion of municipal pride and civic rights. The Italian town of [[Reggio Emilia]], for instance, has SPQR in its coat of arms, standing for "Senatus Populusque Regiensis". There have been confirmed usages and reports of the deployment of the "SPQx" template in;

White supremacists tend to associate "SPQR" with the militaristic ethos of the Roman legions. There is no clear evidence that it appeared regularly on Roman military insignia and equipment, but SPQR was heavily used by [[Benito Mussolini|Mussolini]]'s [[Fascism|fascist]] regime.&lt;ref name=Pharos2/&gt;

While some white supremacists have adopted SPQR as a sort of badge, one should not confuse that usage with the large number of groups and individuals who also use it for other purposes.&lt;ref name=Pharos1/&gt;

The '''Texas Declaration of Independence''' was the formal declaration of independence of the [[Republic of Texas]] from [[Mexico]] in the [[Texas Revolution]]. It was adopted at the [[Convention of 1836]] at [[Washington-on-the-Brazos, Texas|Washington-on-the-Brazos]] on March 2, 1836, and formally signed the next day after mistakes were noted in the text.

==Background==
In October 1835, settlers in [[Mexican Texas]] launched the [[Texas Revolution]].

However, within Austin, many struggled with understanding what was the ultimate goal of the Revolution.  Some believed that the goal should be total independence from Mexico, while others sought the reimplementation of the Mexican [[Constitution of 1824]] (which offered greater freedoms than the centralist government declared in Mexico the prior year).&lt;ref name=roberts98&gt;Roberts and Olson (2001), p. 98.&lt;/ref&gt;  To settle the issue, a convention was called for March 1836.

This convention differed from the previous Texas councils of [[Convention of 1832|1832]], [[Convention of 1833|1833]], and the 1835 [[Consultation (Texas)|Consultation]].  Many of the delegates to the 1836 convention were young men who had only recently arrived in Texas from the United States, in violation of the immigration ban of April, 1830, although many of them had participated in one of the battles in 1835. The only two known native Texans to sign are Jose Francisco Ruiz and Jose Antonio Navarro. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/fru11|title=RUIZ, JOSE FRANCISCO|first=STRONG,|last=BERNICE|date=15 June 2010|website=tshaonline.org|accessdate=14 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the delegates were members of the [[War Party (Texian)|War Party]] and were adamant that Texas must declare its independence from Mexico.&lt;ref name=roberts142&gt;Roberts and Olson (2001), p. 142.&lt;/ref&gt;  Forty-one delegates arrived in [[Washington-on-the-Brazos]] on February 28.&lt;ref name="roberts142"/&gt;

==Development==
The convention was convened on March 1 with [[Richard Ellis (politician)|Richard Ellis]] as president.&lt;ref name=davis38&gt;Davis (1982), p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt;  The delegates selected   a committee of five to draft a declaration of independence; the committee was led by [[George Childress]] and also included Edward Conrad, James Gaines, [[Bailey Hardeman]], and [[Collin McKinney]].  The committee submitted its draft within a mere 24 hours, leading historians to speculate that Childress had written much of it before his arrival at the Convention.&lt;ref name=roberts144&gt;Roberts and Olson (2001), p. 144.&lt;/ref&gt;

The declaration was  approved on March 2 with no debate.  Based primarily on the writings of [[John Locke]] and [[Thomas Jefferson]], the declaration proclaimed that the Mexican government "ceased to protect the lives, liberty, and property of the people, from whom its legitimate powers are derived"&lt;ref name=roberts145&gt;Roberts and Olson (2001), p. 145.&lt;/ref&gt; and complained about "arbitrary acts of oppression and tyranny".&lt;ref name=roberts146&gt;Roberts and Olson (2001), p. 146.&lt;/ref&gt;  Throughout the declaration are numerous references to the United States laws, rights, and customs.  Omitted from the declaration was the fact that the author and many of the signatories were occupying Texas illegally, and therefore had no legal rights in the government of Mexico.  The declaration makes clear that the men were accustomed to the laws and privileges of the United States, and were unfamiliar with the language, religion, and traditions of the nation that they were rebelling against.

The declaration officially established the [[Republic of Texas]].

Among others, the declaration mentions the following reasons for the separation:

* The [[1824 Constitution of Mexico]] establishing a [[federal republic]] had been usurped and changed into a centralist [[military dictatorship]] by Gen. [[Antonio López de Santa Anna]].
* The Mexican government had invited settlers to [[Texas]] and promised them constitutional liberty and republican government, but then reneged on these guarantees.  (It did not mention that many settlers, including the author and majority of signatories, were factually uninvited, illegal trespassers.&lt;ref name="scott122"&gt;Scott (2000), p. 122.&lt;/ref&gt;)
* Texas was in union with the Mexican state of [[Coahuila]] as [[Coahuila y Tejas]], with the capital in distant [[Saltillo]], and thus the affairs of Texas were decided at a great distance from the province and in the [[Spanish language]], which the immigrants called "an unknown tongue".
* Political rights to which the settlers had previously been accustomed in the United States, such as the [[right to arms|right to keep and bear arms]] and the right to [[jury trial|trial by jury]], were denied.
* No system of [[public education]] had been established.
* Attempts by the Mexican government to enforce import tariffs were called "piratical attacks" by "foreign desperadoes".
* The settlers were not allowed [[freedom of religion]]. All legal settlers were required to convert to Catholicism.

Based upon the [[United States Declaration of Independence]], the Texas Declaration also contains many memorable expressions of American political principles:

*"''the right of trial by jury, that palladium of civil liberty, and only safe guarantee for the life, liberty, and property of the citizen.''"
*"''our arms ... are essential to our defence, the rightful property of freemen, and formidable only to tyrannical governments.''"

Fifty-seven of the sixty moved to Texas from the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sonofthesouth.net/texas/texas-declaration-independence.htm|title=Texas Declaration of Independence|work=sonofthesouth.net|accessdate=15 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ten of them had lived in Texas for more than six years, while one-quarter of them had been in the province for less than a year.&lt;ref name="scott122"&gt;Scott (2000), p. 122.&lt;/ref&gt; This is significant, because it indicates that the majority of signatories had moved to Texas after the [[Law of April 6, 1830]], banning immigration, had taken effect, meaning that the majority were legally citizens of the United States, occupying Texas illegally. Fifty-nine of these men were delegates to the Convention, and one was the Convention Secretary, Herbert S. Kimble, who was not a delegate.

{{italic title}}
'''''The Englishman's Library''''' was an English book series of the 1840s, a venture of the publisher [[James Burns (publisher)|James Burns]]. It ran eventually to 31 volumes.

The title had been used already in 1824, for ''The Englishman's library'', edited by E. H. L., published by [[Charles Knight (publisher)|Charles Knight]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Englishman|title=The Englishman's Library|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OdgGAAAAQAAJ|accessdate=6 January 2013|year=1824}}&lt;/ref&gt; The series was announced in ambitious fashion in the ''[[British Critic]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The British Critic, Quarterly Theological Review, and Ecclesiastical Record|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bUUDAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA250|accessdate=6 January 2013|year=1839|publisher=C. &amp; J. Rivington, and J. Mawman|pages=250–1}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was started by [[William Gresley (divine)|William Gresley]] and [[Edward Churton]], with propagandistic aims; the works are still a source for the "[[condition of England]]" debate of the time. Gresley wrote six novels for the series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=John Sutherland|title=The Stanford Companion to Victorian Fiction|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QzJ3yNVVqtUC&amp;pg=PA264|accessdate=6 January 2013|date=1 November 1990|publisher=Stanford University Press|isbn=978-0-8047-1842-4|page=264}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aims==
According to its prospectus, the Library aimed to "unite a popular style with sound Christian principles". The announced authors did not in fact all contribute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=John Henry Newman|title=Letters and Diaries of John Henry Newman: Littlemore and the parting of friends May 1842-October 1843|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=d_SWAJPBo5wC&amp;pg=PA300|accessdate=6 January 2013|year=1961|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-925458-3|page=300 note 3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Those behind the series were younger [[High Church]] men who wished to imitate some of the success of the ''[[Tracts for the Times]]''. They were less hostile to the Tractarians than older, more orthodox members of the [[Hackney Phalanx]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Peter B. Nockles|author2=Peter Benedict Nockles|title=The Oxford Movement in Context: Anglican High Churchmanship, 1760-1857|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jM8Fk_iF1YMC&amp;pg=PA286|accessdate=6 January 2013|year=1994|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-58719-8|page=286}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Three-Piece No. 3: Vertebrae (Working Model)''''' is a bronze sculpture by [[Henry Moore]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://siris-artinventories.si.edu/ipac20/ipac.jsp?session=KG0669200B169.45099&amp;profile=ariall&amp;uri=link=3100009~!1469772~!3100001~!3100002&amp;aspect=Browse&amp;menu=search&amp;ri=3&amp;source=~!siartinventories&amp;term=Three+Piece+No.+3%3A+Vertebrae%2C&amp;index=ALTIT "Three Piece No. 3: Vertebrae, (sculpture)"]. ''SIRIS''&lt;/ref&gt; It was cast in 1968 as in edition of 8, along with an artist's copy which is now part of the [[Tate]] collection.&lt;ref name=Tate&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/art/research-publications/henry-moore/henry-moore-om-ch-working-model-for-three-piece-no3-vertebrae-r1171989 Tate: ''Working Model for Three Piece No. 3: Vertebrae'']&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
It is in the [[Nasher Sculpture Center]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hirshhorn.si.edu/visit/collection_object.asp?key=32&amp;subkey=10404 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-05-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629171155/http://hirshhorn.si.edu/visit/collection_object.asp?key=32&amp;subkey=10404 |archivedate=2011-06-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The sculpture refers to bones, which Moore collected.&lt;ref&gt;''A Garden for Art'', Valerie J. Fletcher, LOC # 97-61991, p.70&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Each of the forms, although different, has the same basic shape. Just as in a backbone which may be made up of twenty segments where each one is roughly like the others but not exactly the same…This is why I call these sculptures Vertebrae. The two or three forms are basically alike but are arranged to go with each other in different positions. The sculptor’s life is one of thinking, reacting, or making, expressing himself through form, through shape – for me the three-dimensional world is unending. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Working Model for Three Piece No.3: Vertebrae 1968 (LH 579)|url=http://www.henry-moore.org/works-in-public/world/united-states-of-america/washington-dc/hirshhorn-museum-and-sculpture-garden/working-model-for-three-piece-no3-vertebrae-1968|publisher=Henry Moore Foundation|accessdate=14 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4144">[[File:TiberiusBedeFolio60vInitialA.jpg|thumb|A decorated initial ''A'' from folio 60v of the Tiberius Bede.]]
'''British Library, [[MS Cotton Tiberius]] C. II''', or the '''Tiberius Bede''', is an 8th-century [[Illuminated manuscript|illuminated]] [[manuscript]] of [[Bede]]'s ''[[Ecclesiastical History of the English People|Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum]]''.  It is one of only four surviving 8th-century manuscripts of Bede, another of which happens to be MS Cotton Tiberius A. XIV, produced at [[Monkwearmouth–Jarrow Abbey]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bl.uk/catalogues/illuminatedmanuscripts/TourPopup.asp?TourID=5 British Library]&lt;/ref&gt;  As such it is one of the closest texts to Bede's autograph. The manuscript has 155 [[vellum]] [[Bookbinding|folio]]s.  This manuscript may have been the [[Latin]] text on which the [[Alfred the Great|Alfredian]] [[Old English]] translation of Bede's ''Ecclesiastical History'' was based.  The manuscript is decorated with [[Zoomorphism|zoomorphic]] initials in a partly [[Insular art|Insular]] and partly Continental style.

The manuscript has given its name to the 'Tiberius' group of manuscripts, connected on stylistic grounds and sometimes also known as the 'Canterbury' group, though the region of their production remains unknown – [[Mercia]] has also been suggested. Apart from the Tiberius Bede, the group includes: [[Vespasian Psalter]], [[Stockholm Codex Aureus]], [[Barberini Gospels]], [[Book of Cerne]],&lt;ref name=brown2005.282&gt;Brown 2005, p. 282&lt;/ref&gt; [[Blickling Psalter]], [[Codex Bigotianus]] ([[Bibliothèque nationale de France|BnF]] MS lat. 281, 298),&lt;ref&gt;Brown 2011, p. 134&lt;/ref&gt; [[Royal Bible]] ([[British Library]] MS Royal 1.E.vi),&lt;ref&gt;Brown 2011, p. 139&lt;/ref&gt; [[Royal Prayer Book|Royal Prayerbook]], [[Book of Nunnaminster]],&lt;ref&gt;Brown 2011, p. 158&lt;/ref&gt; [[Harleian prayerbook|Harleian Prayerbook]],&lt;ref name=brown2011.162&gt;Brown 2011, p. 162&lt;/ref&gt; [[Leningrad Gospels|Saint Petersburg Gospels]],&lt;ref&gt;Brown 2005, pp. 282–283&lt;/ref&gt; [[Anglian collection]] manuscript V ([[British Library]] MS Cotton Vespasian B.vi, folios 104–109),&lt;ref name=brown2005.282 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brown 2011, p. 164&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dumville 1976&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bibliothèque nationale de France|BnF]] MS lat. 10861,&lt;ref name=brown2011.162 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brown 1986&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bodleian Library]] MS Hatton 93, [[Salisbury Cathedral]] Library MS 117,&lt;ref name=brown2005.282 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brown 2011, pp. 163–164&lt;/ref&gt; and a number of other manuscripts.&lt;ref name=brown2005.282 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brown 2011, p. 164 n. 213&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19861">The following is a complete '''list of books published by [[Tom Clancy]]''', an [[American literature|American author]] of contemporary [[spy fiction]] and [[military fiction]].

== Works by year of publication ==

; ''[[The Hunt for Red October]]'' (1984): Clancy's first published novel. CIA analyst Jack Ryan assists in the defection of a respected [[Soviet Navy|Soviet naval]] captain, who commands ''[[Red October (fictional submarine)|Red October]]'', which is the Soviet Navy's most advanced [[ballistic missile submarine]]. The 1990 [[The Hunt for Red October (film)|movie]] stars [[Alec Baldwin]] as Ryan and [[Sean Connery]] as Captain Ramius. U.S. submarine commander Bart Mancuso is introduced in this novel, and nearly every subsequent book has Mancuso in ever increasing command of U.S. submarine forces.  U.S. naval aviator Robby Jackson, who would be later known as Ryan's friend, is also introduced.
; ''[[Red Storm Rising]]'' (1986): War between [[NATO]] and [[Soviet Union|USSR]]. The basis of the combat game of the same name, this book is not a member of the Ryan story series (although a protagonist of the story has many similarities with Jack Ryan). Cowritten with [[Larry Bond]].
; ''[[Patriot Games]]'' (1987): ''Patriot Games'' chronologically predates the first book that Clancy wrote, ''The Hunt for Red October''. Jack Ryan, as well as his family, becomes a target of the Ulster Liberation Army (ULA), a fictional offshoot of the [[Irish Republican Army]], for foiling their attack on the [[Prince of Wales|Prince]] and [[Princess of Wales]] in [[London]]. The 1992 [[Patriot Games (film)|movie]] stars [[Harrison Ford]] as Ryan and [[Samuel L. Jackson]] as Robby Jackson.
; ''[[The Cardinal of the Kremlin]]'' (1988): The sequel to ''The Hunt for Red October''. First appearance of [[John Clark (Tom Clancy character)|John Clark]] and Sergey Golovko. Ryan leads a CIA operation aimed at extracting the agency's highest agent-in-place in the Kremlin, codenamed CARDINAL, who is being hunted by the KGB, and simultaneously forces the head of the [[KGB]] to [[defection|defect]]. Other elements include anti-satellite lasers and other [[Strategic Defense Initiative|SDI]]-type weapons, and the Soviet war in Afghanistan. Major Alan Gregory is introduced here, and later appears in ''The Bear and the Dragon'' updating [[Surface-to-air missile|SAM]] software. Colonel Bondarenko is also introduced here, and would appear in later books offering advice to Golovko in ''Executive Orders'' and commanding the Russian Army defenses against China in its sequel ''The Bear and the Dragon''.)
; ''[[Clear and Present Danger]]'' (1989): The President authorizes the CIA to use American military forces in a covert war against cocaine producers in [[Colombia]]. The operation is betrayed. Ryan meets John Clark as they lead a mission to rescue abandoned soldiers. Domingo "Ding" Chavez (Clark's protege in later novels) is one of the rescued soldiers. The [[Clear and Present Danger (film)|1994 film]] stars [[Harrison Ford]] as Ryan, [[Willem Dafoe]] as Clark, and [[Raymond Cruz]] as Chavez.
; ''[[The Sum of All Fears]]'' (1991): Palestinian and former East German terrorists find a nuclear weapon that had been lost by Israel, and use it to attack the United States. This nearly triggers a war between the U.S. and the Soviet Union, due to the incompetence of the new President and his mistress with an anti-Ryan agenda. Ryan intervenes to avert the war. The [[The Sum of All Fears (film)|2002 film]] stars Ben Affleck as Ryan and Liev Schreiber as Clark, and changes the identity and motivation of the terrorists to [[neo-Nazis]].
; ''[[Without Remorse]]'' (1993): ''Without Remorse'' takes place during the [[Vietnam War]], when Jack Ryan was a teenager. Ex-[[United States Navy SEALs|SEAL]] John Clark (then John Kelly) fights a one-man war against drug dealers in Baltimore, attracting the attention of Jack's father Emmett, a Baltimore police detective. He also helps plan and execute a raid on a prisoner-of-war camp in North Vietnam. Clark later joins the CIA.
; ''[[Debt of Honor]]'' (1994): A secret cabal of extreme nationalists gains control of Japan (having developed some nuclear weapons) and start a war with the U.S. Ryan, now [[National Security Advisor (United States)|National Security Advisor]], and Clark and Chavez, agents in Japan, help win the war. The Vice President resigns in a scandal, and the President appoints Ryan to replace him.  A vengeful Japanese airline pilot then crashes a jetliner into the U.S. Capitol during a joint session of Congress attended by most senior U.S. government officials, including the President.  Ryan thus becomes the new President through succession.
; ''[[Executive Orders]]'' (1996): Now-President Ryan survives press hazing, an assassination attempt, and a [[biological warfare]] attack on the United States. Clark and Chavez trace the virus to a Middle Eastern madman, and the U.S. military goes to work.
; ''[[SSN (novel)|SSN: Strategies for Submarine Warfare]]'' (1996): Follows the missions of [[USS Cheyenne (SSN-773)|USS ''Cheyenne'']] in a future war with China precipitated by China's invasion of the disputed [[Spratly Islands]].  Also not a [[Jack Ryan (Tom Clancy character)|Ryan universe]] book, SSN is actually a loosely connected collection of "scenario" chapters in support of the [[Tom Clancy's SSN|eponymous video game]].
; ''[[Rainbow Six (novel)|Rainbow Six]]'' (1998): Released to coincide with [[Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six (video game)|the video game of the same name]]. John Clark and Ding, who is now Clark's son-in-law, lead an elite multinational anti-terrorist unit that combats a worldwide genocide attempt by eco-terrorists. Ryan is the U.S. President and only mentioned or referred to as either 'The President' or 'Jack'.
; ''[[The Bear and the Dragon]]'' (2000): War between Russia and China. Ryan recognizes the independence of [[Taiwan]], Chinese police officers kill a Roman Catholic Cardinal, and American armed forces help Russia defeat a Chinese invasion of [[Siberia]].
; ''[[Red Rabbit]]'' (2002): In the early 1980s, CIA analyst Ryan aids in the defection of a Soviet officer who knows of a [[Pope John Paul II assassination attempt|plan to assassinate]] [[Pope John Paul II]].
; ''[[The Teeth of the Tiger]]'' (2003): Jack Ryan's son, Jack Ryan, Jr., becomes an intelligence analyst, and then a field consultant, for The Campus, an off-the-books intelligence agency with the freedom to discreetly assassinate individuals "who threaten national security", following the end of the Jack Ryan Sr. presidential administration.

; ''[[Against All Enemies (novel)|Against All Enemies]]'' (2011, with [[Peter Telep]]): After surviving a Taliban bombing attack in [[Pakistan]] that claims the lives of his colleagues and his asset, CIA paramilitary officer and former Navy SEAL Max Moore is assigned by a government joint task force to take down a [[Mexican drug cartel]]. Along the way, he must deal with Taliban terrorists trying to enter the United States through the [[Mexico-US border]].
; ''[[Locked On (novel)|Locked On]]'' (2011, with [[Mark Greaney (novelist)|Mark Greaney]]): While Jack Ryan Jr. trains to become a field operative within The Campus, his father campaigns for re-election as President of the United States. A devout enemy of Jack Sr. launches a privately funded vendetta to discredit him, while a corrupt Pakistani general has entered into a deadly pact with a fanatical terrorist to procure nuclear warheads.
; ''[[Search and Destroy (novel)|Search and Destroy]]'' (2012, with [[Peter Telep]]) (Cancelled)
; ''[[Threat Vector (novel)|Threat Vector]]'' (2012, with [[Mark Greaney (novelist)|Mark Greaney]]): Jack Ryan has only just moved back into the Oval Office when he is faced with a new international threat. An aborted coup in the People's Republic of China has left President Wei Zhen Lin with no choice but to agree with the expansionist policies of General Su Ke Qiang. They have declared the South China Sea a protectorate and are planning an invasion of Taiwan. The Ryan administration is determined to thwart China’s ambitions, but the stakes are dangerously high as a new breed of powerful Chinese anti-ship missiles endanger the US Navy's plans to protect the island. Meanwhile, Chinese cyber warfare experts have launched a devastating attack on American infrastructure.
; ''[[Command Authority (novel)|Command Authority]]'' (2013, with [[Mark Greaney (novelist)|Mark Greaney]]): There is a new strong man in Russia but his rise to power is based on a dark secret hidden decades in the past. The clue to the mystery lies with a most unexpected source, President Jack Ryan.

The '''''World Book Encyclopedia''''' is an [[encyclopedia]] published in the [[United States]]. The company's "mission is to enhance learning and reading for children around the world by developing trustworthy, engaging content to create products that will engage children of all ages at home, on the go, in the classroom or in libraries worldwide. We aspire to establish World Book as a renowned, global, adaptive, and mission-driven enterprise that helps kids learn and read throughout their entire childhood journey."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.worldbook.com/about-us.aspx|title=About Us - World Book|website=WorldBook.com|accessdate=17 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The encyclopedia was designed to cover major areas of knowledge uniformly, but it shows particular strength in scientific, technical, and medical subjects.&lt;ref name="indiana"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indiana.edu/~librcsd/libguide/ency/12.html |title=Encyclopedias in English and Other Languages |publisher=Library Research Guides.

The first edition (1917) contained eight volumes. New editions have since appeared every year except 1920, 1924, and 1932, with major revisions in 1929 (13 volumes), 1947 (19 volumes), 1960 (20 volumes), 1971 (22 volumes), and 1988 (new typeface and page design, and some 10,000 new editorial features).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Kobasa, Paul A. |title=Encyclopedia |work=World Book Online Reference Center |year=2008 |accessdate=2008-01-13 |url=http://www.worldbookonline.com/wb/Article?id=ar180800}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, the company claims that World Book is the most up-to-date commercial encyclopedia, with over 2,500 pages updated in 2016 and more than 14,000 pages in total.

World Book also publishes children's non-fiction and picture books under the Bright Connections Media imprint, and educational development and supplemental instructional resources through Incentive Publications by World Book.

The 1917 edition was published by the Hanson-Roach-Fowler Company, but within two years, ''World Book'' became the property of W.F. Quarrie &amp; Company. In 1945, the ''World Book'' became the property of [[Field Enterprises]]. In 1978, ''World Book'' was purchased by [[Scott Fetzer Company]], which in turn has been a subsidiary of [[Berkshire Hathaway]] since 1985.

== Overview ==
[[File:World Book Encyclopedia, 1990.jpg|thumb|left|''World Book Encyclopedia'' (1990)]]

The first edition of ''The World Book Encyclopedia'' was published (as simply ''The World Book'') in 1917. "As a rule," writes founding editor Michael Vincent O'Shea (professor of education at the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison|University of Wisconsin]]) in the preface of that first edition, "encyclopedias are apt to be quite formal and technical. A faithful effort has been made in the World Book to avoid this common defect." Since the encyclopedia first appeared in print, it has grown from 8 volumes to 22 volumes, from a set with limited color plates to one with color throughout. Over the years, the ''World Book'' has been characterized by its design. Unlike most other encyclopedias, it is traditionally published in variously sized volumes, depending on the letter of the alphabet. Although most volumes cover exactly one letter completely, the letters with exceptionally numerous entries ("C" and "S") are divided between two volumes, while adjacent letters with relatively few entries ("J"&amp;ndash;"K", "N"&amp;ndash;"O", "Q"&amp;ndash;"R", "U"&amp;ndash;"V", and "W"&amp;ndash;"Z") share a volume. ''World Book'' editors lay out major articles distinctly, often starting them on a page of their own, perhaps with a two-column heading. Materials are reviewed and authored by experts. It recognizes that one of the primary uses of general-purpose encyclopedias is students' work on school reports. For instance, every article for a [[United States|U.S.]] state has a box giving information about such things as the official state bird and tree and each [[President of the United States]] gets a very distinctive look with an oversized portrait, a timeline and significant historical events that occurred during that president's administration.

== Alternative editions ==
[[File:Braille 1959 World Book Encyclopedia.jpg|200px|Braille 1959 ''World Book Encyclopedia''|thumb|right]]

In 1962 ''World Book'' produced a [[Braille]] edition, which filled 145 volumes and nearly 40,000 pages. It was the first encyclopedia in Braille. The project was mainly an effort in goodwill, for the company did not see its way clear to selling enough copies of the set to cover production costs. Eventually, all sets of the Braille edition were donated to several institutions for the blind. In 1964 the company also published a [[large-print]] edition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=[[Foster Stockwell|Stockwell, Foster]] |title=A History of Information Storage and Retrieval |year=2001 |page=137}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An international version, aimed at [[English-speaking world|English-speakers]] outside of North America, was also produced in 1992.

Since 1998, in addition to the print and [[CD-ROM]] editions of the 22-volume, 13,800-page encyclopedia, ''World Book'' also publishes an online version called ''World Book Online''. The online version includes 23 subscription databases with all of the articles contained in the print set, as well as several thousand additional articles and the contents of every yearbook ''World Book'' has published since 1922. Articles are also available in Spanish. The online version contains links to current web sites and magazine articles, a news section, and video and audio samples.

== Digital multimedia encyclopedia ==
''World Book Encyclopedia'' is also published in electronic form for [[Microsoft Windows]] and Apple's [[Mac OS X]]. Electronic editions contain the entire text of the 22-volume ''World Book Encyclopedia'', plus illustrations, video clips, 3D panoramic views, and sounds. The articles bring together a complete story, multimedia content, an article outline, research aids and links to related information. Online updates to articles and a "Month in Brief" time browser are available by subscription.

Apple included a bundled copy of the Mac OS X Edition of ''World Book Encyclopedia'' when they made OS X the default operating system for all new computers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.apple.com/pr/library/2002/jan/07macosx.html |title=MACWORLD EXPO 2002 Press Announcement |accessdate=2010-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; This edition had some Mac-only features including a more intuitive user interface, Sticky Notes sharing via [[Bonjour (software)|Bonjour]] technology, ''Trivia Challenge'' game, a collection of editor-approved webcams, Notepad, speech capabilities and "This Day in History", "Media Showcase" and "Librarian" [[Dashboard (Mac OS)|widgets]].

Since November 2007, both the Windows and Mac electronic editions of ''World Book Encyclopedia'' have been developed and published by Software MacKiev.
