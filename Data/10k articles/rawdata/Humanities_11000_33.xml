'''Alfred Ernst Rosenberg''' ({{lang-ru|Альфред-Эрнст Вольдемарович Розенберг}}, [[Romanization of Russian|tr.]] {{transl|ru|Al'fred-Ernst Vol'demarovich Rozenberg}}; 12 January 1893&amp;nbsp;– 16 October 1946) was a [[Germany|German]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britannica.com/biography/Alfred-Rosenberg Alfred Rosenberg] Encyclopaedia Britannica&lt;/ref&gt; theorist and an influential ideologue of the [[Nazi Party]]. Rosenberg was first introduced to [[Adolf Hitler]] by [[Dietrich Eckart]] and later held several important posts in the Nazi government.

The author of a seminal work of [[Nazi ideology]], ''[[The Myth of the Twentieth Century]]'' (1930), Rosenberg is considered one of the main authors of key [[Nazism|National Socialist]] ideological creeds, including its [[Nazism and race|racial theory]], [[persecution of the Jews]], ''[[Lebensraum]]'', abrogation of the [[Treaty of Versailles]], and opposition to what was considered "[[degenerate art|degenerate]]" modern art. He is known for his rejection of and hatred for Christianity,&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard J. Evans|Evans, Richard J.]] (2005) ''[[The Third Reich in Power]]'' New York: [[Penguin Books]]. p.238-40. {{isbn|0-14-303790-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|quotes = |author=Hexham, Irving |year=2007|title=Inventing 'Paganists': a Close Reading of Richard Steigmann-Gall's the Holy Reich|journal = [[Journal of Contemporary History]]|volume =  42|issue =  1 |pages=59–78 |publisher=SAGE Publications|location=|doi = 10.1177/0022009407071632|bibcode =|oclc = |id=  |url=http://jch.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/42/1/59 |format= |accessdate=|laysummary = |laysource =|laydate =|quote =|authorlink = Irving Hexham }}&lt;/ref&gt; having played an important role in the development of German Nationalist [[Positive Christianity]].&lt;ref name="Rosenberg"&gt;{{cite web  |url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Holocaust/Rosenberg.html |title=Alfred Rosenberg |publisher=Jewish Virtual Library (American-Israeli Cooperative Enterprise) |accessdate=7 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; At [[Nuremberg trials|Nuremberg]] he was sentenced to death and executed by hanging for war crimes and crimes against humanity.

==Early life==
Rosenberg was born on 12 January 1893 in [[Reval]] (now [[Tallinn]]) in the [[Russian Empire]], the capital of modern [[Estonia]], to a family of [[Baltic Germans]]. His father, Waldemar Wilhelm Rosenberg,&lt;ref name="google"&gt;{{cite book|title=Power Politics and Social Change in National Socialist Germany: A Process of Escalation Into Mass Destruction|author=Steiner, J.M.|date=1976|publisher=Mouton|isbn=9789027976512|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=duwqSxjG6hAC|page=411|accessdate=10 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a wealthy merchant from [[Latvia]], and his mother, Elfriede (née Siré), was a teacher of [[French language]] in Reval.&lt;ref name=Kapo&gt;Pekka Erelt [http://ekspress.delfi.ee/kuum/kapo-luuras-natsijuhi-alfred-rosenbergi-jarele?id=64991850 Kapo luuras natsijuhi Alfred Rosenbergi järele] [[Eesti Ekspress]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Hungarian-Jewish]] journalist Franz Szell, who was apparently residing in [[Sovetsk, Kaliningrad Oblast|Tilsit]], [[Prussia]], [[Weimar Republic|Germany,]] spent a year researching in [[Latvia]]n and [[Estonia]]n archives before publishing an open letter in 1936, with copies to [[Hermann Göring]], [[Joseph Goebbels]], German foreign minister [[Konstantin von Neurath]] and others, accusing Rosenberg of having "no drop of German blood" flowing in his veins. Szell wrote that among Rosenberg's ancestors were only "Latvians, Jews, Mongols, and French."&lt;ref&gt;Staff (March 2008) [http://www.aim25.com/cats/104/8539.htm "Szell, Franz (fl 1936-1937): correspondence regarding Alfred Rosenberg" (catalog entry)] Wiener Library Quote: "Franz Szell, an exiled Hungarian journalist apparently resident in Tilsit, Lithuania spent more than a year in the archives in Latvia and Estonia researching Alfred Rosenberg's family history with a view to publishing the open letter, 936/1."&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of his open letter, Szell was deported by Lithuanian authorities on September 15, 1936.&lt;ref&gt;Staff (September 5, 1936) [http://www.jta.org/1936/09/16/archive/lithuania-deports-writer-who-called-nazi-chief-non-aryan "Lithuania Deports Writer Who Called Nazi Chief 'non-aryan'"] ''[[Jewish Telegraph Agency]]''&lt;/ref&gt; His claims were repeated in the 15 September 1937 issue of the [[Vatican City|Vatican]] newspaper ''[[L'Osservatore Romano]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Gugenberger, Edouard (2002) ''Boten der Apokalypse. Visionäre des Dritten Reichs''. Vienna. p.196 {{ISBN|3-8000-3840-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The young Rosenberg graduated from the Petri-Realschule (currently Tallinna Reaalkool) and went on to study architecture at the [[Riga Polytechnical Institute]] and engineering at [[Bauman Moscow State Technical University|Moscow's Highest Technical School]]&lt;ref name="zeno"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zeno.org/Geschichte/M/Der+N%C3%BCrnberger+Proze%C3%9F/Hauptverhandlungen/Einhundertachter+Tag.+Montag,+15.+April+1946/Nachmittagssitzung |title=Der Nürnberger Prozeß, Hauptverhandlungen, Einhundertachter Tag.

During his stays at home in Reval, he attended the art studio of the famed painter [[Ants Laikmaa]], but even though he showed promise, there are no records that he ever exhibited.

During the [[German occupation of Estonia during World War I|German occupation]] in 1918, Rosenberg served as a teacher at the [[Gustav Adolf Gymnasium]]. He gave his first speech on [[Jewish Bolshevism|Jewish Marxism]] on 30 November, at the [[House of the Blackheads (Tallinn)|House of the Blackheads]], after the outbreak of the [[Estonian War of Independence]].&lt;ref name=Kapo/&gt; He emigrated to Germany with the retreating imperial army, along with [[Max Scheubner-Richter]], who served as something of a mentor to Rosenberg and to his ideology. Arriving in [[Munich]], he contributed to [[Dietrich Eckart]]'s publication, the ''[[Völkischer Beobachter]]'' (''Ethnic/Nationalist Observer''). By this time, he was both an [[antisemite]] – influenced by [[Houston Stewart Chamberlain]]'s book ''[[The Foundations of the Nineteenth Century]]'', one of the key proto-Nazi books of [[racial theory]] &amp;ndash; and an [[Anti-communism|anti-Bolshevik]].&lt;ref name="Evans 2004 178–179"&gt;{{cite book | last = Evans | first = Richard J | authorlink = Richard J.

==Nazi career==
[[File:Mythus.JPG|upright|left|187px|thumb|''Der Mythus des 20. Jahrhunderts''. 1939 edition]]

In 1923, after the failed [[Beer Hall Putsch]], Hitler, who had been imprisoned for [[treason]], appointed Rosenberg as the leader of the National Socialist movement, a position he held until Hitler's release. Hitler remarked privately in later years that his choice of Rosenberg, whom he regarded as weak and lazy, was strategic; Hitler did not want the temporary leader of the Nazis to become too popular or hungry for power, because a person with either of those two qualities might not want to cede the party leadership after Hitler's release. However, at the time of the appointment Hitler had no reason to believe that he would soon be released, and Rosenberg had not appeared weak, so this may have been Hitler reading back into history his dissatisfaction with Rosenberg for the job he did.&lt;ref&gt;Cecil, pp.42–3&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1929 Rosenberg founded the [[Militant League for German Culture]]. He later formed the "[[Institute for Study of the Jewish Question|Institute for the Study of the Jewish Question]]," dedicated to identifying and attacking Jewish influence in German culture and to recording the history of Judaism from a radical nationalist perspective. He became a [[Reichstag (Weimar Republic)|Reichstag]] Deputy in 1930 and published his book on [[Master race|racial theory]] ''[[The Myth of the Twentieth Century]]'' (''Der Mythus des 20. Jahrhunderts'') which deals with key issues in the National Socialist ideology, such as the "Jewish question." Rosenberg intended his book as a sequel to [[Houston Stewart Chamberlain]]'s above-cited book. {{Anchor|Pseudointellectualism_and_pseudoreligion}} Despite selling more than a million copies by 1945, its influence within Nazism remains doubtful. It is often said to have been a book that was officially venerated within Nazism, but one that few had actually read beyond the first chapter or even found comprehensible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Goldensohn |first=Leon | authorlink = Leon Goldensohn | author2 = Gellately, Robert (ed)| author2link =Robert Gellately|title=The Nuremberg Interviews |publisher=[[Alfred A.

&lt;/ref&gt; Hitler called it "stuff nobody can understand"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  |last=Speer |first=Albert | authorlink = Albert Speer |title=Inside the Third Reich: Memoirs by Albert Speer. Translated by [[Richard and Clara Winston]] |publisher=Macmillan |year=  1970 |location=New York |page=115}}
&lt;/ref&gt; and disapproved of its pseudo-religious tone.&lt;ref name="Evans 2004 178–179"/&gt;

Rosenberg convinced Hitler that communism was an international threat due to the fragility of the Soviet Union's internal political structure. "[[Jewish-Bolshevism]]" was accepted as a target for Nazism during the early 1920s.&lt;ref name="Evans 2004 178–179"/&gt;

In Rome during November 1932 Rosenberg participated in the [[Volta Conference]]. British historian [[Sir Charles Petrie]] met him there and regarded him with great distaste; Petrie was a Catholic and strongly objected to Rosenberg's anti-Jewish and anti-Catholic sentiments.&lt;ref&gt;Sir Charles Petrie, ''A Historian Looks at His World'' (London, Sidgwick &amp; Jackson, 1972), p. 136.&lt;/ref&gt;

The following year, once Hitler had become Chancellor, Rosenberg was named leader of the Nazi Party's foreign political office, but he played little practical part in the role. Another event of 1933 was Rosenberg's visit to Britain, intended to give the impression that the Nazis would not be a threat and to encourage links between the new regime and the [[British Empire]]. It was a notable failure. When Rosenberg laid a wreath bearing a [[swastika]] at [[The Cenotaph, Whitehall|the Cenotaph]], a [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] candidate slashed it and later threw it in the [[Thames]] and was fined 40 shillings for willful damage at Bow Street magistrate’s court.&lt;ref&gt;"Dr. Rosenberg's Wreath." Times [London, England] 12 May 1933: 11. The Times Digital Archive. Web. 6 February 2014. "There was a further charge against [James Edmond Sears] of wilfully damaging the wreath which was laid on the Cenotaph on Wednesday by Dr Rosenberg on behalf of Herr Hitler".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wordpress"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://greatwarlondon.wordpress.com/2012/11/11/hitlers-wreath-at-the-cenotaph/|title=Hitler&amp;#8217;s wreath at the Cenotaph &amp;#124; Great War London|publisher=greatwarlondon.wordpress.com|accessdate=10 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 1934 Hitler granted Rosenberg responsibility for the spiritual and philosophical education of the Party and all related organizations.

==Racial theories==
{{Nazism sidebar}}
As the Nazi Party's chief racial theorist, Rosenberg oversaw the construction of a human racial "ladder" that justified Hitler's racial and ethnic policies. Rosenberg built on the works of [[Arthur de Gobineau]], [[Houston Stewart Chamberlain]], [[Madison Grant]], the [[Klansman]] [[Lothrop Stoddard]] as well as on the beliefs of Hitler. Rosenberg placed Blacks and Jews at the very bottom of the ladder, while at the very top stood the white "[[Aryan]]" race. Rosenberg promoted the [[Nordic theory]] which regarded Nordics as the "[[master race]]",&lt;ref group=notes&gt;Rosenberg wrote: "No people of Europe is racially homogeneous, also Germany is not. According to the latest research, we accept five races all of which reveal perceptibly different types. But it is beyond question that the true culture bearer for Europe has been in the first place the Nordic race. Great heroes, artists and founders of states have grown from this blood."  ''The Myth of the Twentieth Century'' (1930) p.576&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Though Rosenberg does not use the word "master race". He uses the word "Herrenvolk" (i.e. ruling people) twice in his book ''The Myth'', first referring to the [[Amorite]]s (saying that [[Archibald Sayce|Sayce]] described them as fair skinned and blue eyed) and secondly quoting [[Victor Wallace Germains]]' description of the English in "The Truth about Kitchener". ("The Myth of the Twentieth Century") - Pages 26, 660 - 1930&lt;/ref&gt; superior to all others, including to other Aryans (Indo-Europeans). He was also influenced by the [[Judeo-Masonic conspiracy theory]] promoted by the Catholic [[counter-revolutionary]] tradition, such as the book ''Le Juif, le judaïsme et la judaïsation des peuples chrétiens'' (1869) by [[Roger Gougenot des Mousseaux]], which he translated into German under the title ''The Eternal Jew''.&lt;ref name="Michael"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Michael |first1=R. |title=A History of Catholic Antisemitism: The Dark Side of the Church |date=2008 |publisher=Springer |page=128}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rosenberg got the racial term ''[[Untermensch]]'' from the title of Stoddard's 1922 book ''The Revolt Against Civilization: The Menace of the Under-man'', which had been adopted by the Nazis from that book's German version ''Der Kulturumsturz: Die Drohung des Untermenschen'' (1925).&lt;ref&gt;

Rosenberg reshaped Nazi racial policy over the years, but it always consisted of Aryan supremacy, extreme German nationalism and rabid antisemitism. Rosenberg also outspokenly opposed homosexuality – notably in his pamphlet "Der Sumpf" ("The Swamp", 1927). He viewed homosexuality as a hindrance to the expansion of the Nordic population.

Rosenberg's attitude towards [[Slav]]s was flexible and depended on the particular nation involved.&lt;ref group=notes&gt;Rosenberg wrote: "The Czechs, for their part, were stratified by race into a Nordic-Slavic nobility, and lower orders of an Alpine Dinaric stamp, thus displaying that type which the modern Czech so plainly embodies." Page 108, "The one eyed maniacal Ziska of Trocnow, whose head in the Prague National Museum shows him to have been an eastern hither Asiatic type, was the first expression of this totally destructive Taborite movement, which the Czechs must thank for the extermination of the last remaining Germanic powers active within them, as well as the repression of all that was truly Slavic. ''The Myth of the Twentieth Century'' (1930) p.109&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=notes&gt;Rosenberg wrote: "The entire east is diversified throughout; one will need to speak here of the Russian character, of the Germanised peoples of Finland, Estonia and Lithuania, whereat also Poland has developed its clearly outlined individuality." ''The Myth of the Twentieth Century'' (1930) p.643&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of the ideology of "[[Drang nach Osten]]", Rosenberg saw his mission as the conquest and colonization of the Slavic East.&lt;ref&gt;''Oświęcim, 1940–1945: przewodnik po muzeum'', Kazimierz Smoleń, Państwowe Muzeum w Oświęcimiu, 1978, page 12&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Metapolitics: from Wagner and the German Romantics to Hitler, page 221, Peter Viereck, Transaction Publishers 2003&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Der Mythus des 20. Jahrhunderts'' Rosenberg describes Russian Slavs as being overwhelmed by Bolshevism.&lt;ref group=notes&gt;Alfred Rosenberg, Der Mythus des 20. Jahrhunderts: Eine Wertung der seelischgeistigen Gestaltungskämpfe unserer Zeit, München: Hoheneichen, 1930, here p.214: In the year 1917, Russian Man finally disintegrated. He fell into two parts. The Nordic Russian blood gave up the struggle, the eastern Mongolian, powerfully stirred up, summoned Chinese and desert peoples to its aid, Jews and Armenians pushed forward to leadership, and the Kalmuch Tartar Lenin became master. The demonry of this blood directed itself instinctively against everything which outwardly still had some honest effect, looked manly and Nordic, like a living reproach against a type of man whom Lothrop Stoddard described as "subhuman".
&lt;/ref&gt; Regarding Ukrainians, he favoured setting up a buffer state to ease pressure on the German eastern frontier, while agreeing with the notion of the exploitation of Russia for the benefit of Germany.&lt;ref name="Russian Liberation Movement page 30"&gt;Andreyev, Caterine (1990)
''Vlasov and the Russian Liberation Movement: Soviet Reality and Émigré Theories" London: Cambridge University Press. p.30. {{ISBN|0521389607}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the war, Rosenberg was in favour of collaboration with the East Slavs against Bolshevism and offering them national independence unlike other Nazis such as Hitler and Himmler who dismissed such ideas.&lt;ref&gt;Herbert, Ulrich (1997) ''Hitler's Foreign Workers: Enforced Foreign Labor in Germany Under the Third Reich'' London: Cambridge University Press. pp.260–261 {{ISBN|0521470005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hertstein, Robert Edwin (1979) ''The war that Hitler won: Goebbels and the Nazi media campaign'', UK: Hamish Hamilton. p.364 {{ISBN|0241100917}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religious theories==
Rosenberg argued for a new "religion of the blood," based on the supposed innate promptings of the Nordic soul to defend its noble character against racial and cultural degeneration. He believed that this had been embodied in early [[Proto-Indo-Europeans|Indo-European]] religions, notably ancient European ([[Celtic tribes|Celtic]], [[Germanic tribes|Germanic]], [[Ancient Greece|Greek]], [[Roman Empire|Roman]]) [[paganism]], [[Zoroastrianism]], and [[Historical Vedic religion|Vedic Hinduism]].

He rejected Christianity for its universality, for its doctrine of [[original sin]] (at least for Germans whom he declared on one occasion were born noble), and for its teachings on the [[immortality of the soul]],&lt;ref&gt;Cecil, pp. 84–5&lt;/ref&gt; saying, "indeed, absorbing Christianity enfeebled a people."&lt;ref&gt;Cecil, p.92&lt;/ref&gt;  Publicly, Rosenberg affected to deplore Christianity's degeneration owing to Jewish influence.&lt;ref&gt;Cecil, p. 85&lt;/ref&gt;  Following Chamberlain's ideas, he condemned what he called "negative Christianity" (the orthodox beliefs of Protestant and Catholic churches), arguing instead for a so-called [[positive Christianity|"positive" Christianity]]&lt;ref group=notes&gt;Rosenberg wrote: "From the description of Jesus one can select very different features. His personality often makes its appearance as soft and pitying, then, again, bluff and rough. But it is always supported by inward fire. It was in the interest of the Roman church, with its lust for power, to represent subservient humility as the essence of Christ in order to create as many servants as possible for this motivated "ideal". To correct this representation is a further ineradicable requirement of the German movement for renewal. Jesus appears to us today as self-confident lord in the best and highest sense of the word." ''The Myth of the Twentieth Century'' (1930) p.604&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=notes&gt;Rosenberg wrote: "For this reason Jesus, in spite of all Christian churches, signifies a pivotal point in our history. He became the god of the Europeans, yet, not seldom did he appear in a repellent distortion. &lt;br&gt; If the concentrated feeling of personality which built Gothic cathedrals and inspired a [[w:Rembrandt|Rembrandt]] portrait penetrated more clearly into the consciousness of the general public, a new wave of culture would begin. But the prerequisite for this is the overcoming of the former statutory values of the "Christian" churches." ''The Myth of the Twentieth Century'' (1930) p.391&lt;/ref&gt; based on Chamberlain's claim that Jesus was a member of an Indo-European, Nordic enclave resident in ancient [[Galilee]] who struggled against Judaism.&lt;ref group=notes&gt;Rosenberg quotes Dr. Emil Jung referring to statements by the Syrian Christian preacher [[Ephrem the Syrian|Ephraem]] (4th century): "Jesus' mother was a Danaite woman, (that is, someone born in Dan) and he had a Latin as father. Ephraem sees this to be not unhonorable and adds: 'Jesus thus derived his ancestry from two of the greatest and most famous nations, namely, from the Syrians on the maternal side and from the Romans on the paternal.'" ("The Myth of the Twentieth Century") - Page 76 - 1930&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=notes&gt;Rosenberg wrote: "Herder once demanded that the religion dedicated to Jesus should become a religion of Jesus. This was what Chamberlain strove for. A completely free man who disposed inwardly over the entire culture of our times, he has shown the deepest sensitivity for the superhuman simplicity of Christ. He represented Jesus as what he had once appeared to be: a mediator between man and god." ("The Myth of the Twentieth Century") - Page 623 - 1930&lt;/ref&gt; Significantly, in his work explicating the Nazi intellectual belief system, ''[[The Myth of the Twentieth Century]]'', Rosenberg cryptically alludes to and lauds the early Christian heretic [[Marcionism|Marcion]] (who rejected the Old Testament as well as the notion of Christ as the Jewish Messiah) and the Manichaean-inspired, "Aryo-Iranian" [[Cathari]], as being the more authentic interpreters of Christianity versus historically dominant Judaeo-Christianity;&lt;ref group=notes&gt;Rosenberg wrote: "It is characteristic of Roman Christianity that where possible it eliminates the personality of its founder, in order to put in its place the church structure of a rulership by priests." ''The Myth of the Twentieth Century'' (1930) p.160&lt;/ref&gt; moreover these ancient, externally Christian metaphysical forms were more "organically compatible with the Nordic sense of the spiritual and the Nordic 'blood-soul'." For Rosenberg, the anti-intellectual, religious [[doctrine]] was inseparable&lt;ref group=notes&gt;Rosenberg wrote: "The ancient Germanic idea of god is likewise inconceivable without spiritual freedom. Jesus also spoke of the kingdom of heaven within us. The strength of spiritual search already shows itself in the world wanderer, Odin, and can be seen in the seeker and believer, [[Meister Eckhart|Eckehart]], and we see it in all great men from [[Martin Luther|Luther]] to [[Paul de Lagarde|Lagarde]]. This soul also lived within the venerable [[Thomas Aquinas|Thomas of Aquinas]]&lt;!--[sic]--&gt; and in the majority of the occidental fathers of the church." ''The Myth of the Twentieth Century'' (1930) p.247&lt;/ref&gt; from serving the interests of the Nordic race, connecting the individual to his racial nature.&lt;ref group=notes&gt;Rosenberg wrote:"A keen observer has correctly remarked that the Jesus child of the Sistine Madonna is “frankly heroic” in gaze and posture (Wölfflin). That is aptly expressed except that the fundamental ground is lacking as to why the allegedly Jewish family had a heroic look to it. Here, only composition and color distribution, not "inwardness" and "dedication", are determining. These are the prerequisites to the success of a formative will, once again, the racial ideal of beauty. To see in place of the light-brown haired, light skinned Jesus child a blue black, woolly haired, brown skinned Jew boy would be an impossibility. Equally, we cannot think of a Jewish Mother of god next to the holy, even if the latter had the "noble face" of an Offenbach or Disraeli." ''The Myth of the Twentieth Century'' (1930) p.297&lt;/ref&gt;  Rosenberg stated that "The general ideas of the [[Roman Catholicism|Roman]] and of the Protestant churches are negative Christianity and do not, therefore, accord with our (German) soul."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author= | title=Churchmen to Hitler | date=10 August 1936 | work= [[Time Magazine]] | url= http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,762289,00.html?promoid=googlep |accessdate= 14 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=notes&gt;Rosenberg wrote: "The Jewish idea of the "slave of god", one who receives mercy from an arbitrary, absolutist god, has thus passed over to Rome and Wittenberg, and can be attributed to Paul as the actual creator of this doctrine, which is to say that our churches are not Christian but Pauline. Jesus unquestionably praised the One-Being with god. This was his redemption, his goal. He did not preach a condescending granting of mercy from an almighty being in the face of which even the greatest human soul represented a pure nothingness. This doctrine of mercy is naturally very welcome to every church. With such misinterpretation the church and its leaders appear as the "representatives of god". Consequently, they could acquire power by granting mercy through their magic hands." ''The Myth of the Twentieth Century'' (1930) p.237&lt;/ref&gt; His support for Luther as a great German figure was always ambivalent.&lt;ref&gt;Cecil, pp. 87–8&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=notes&gt;Rosenberg wrote: "Now we may certainly also say that the love of Jesus Christ has been the love of one who is conscious of his aristocracy of soul and of his strong personality. Jesus sacrificed himself as a master, not as a servant ... And also Martin Luther knew only too well, what he said, when shortly before his death he wrote "These three words, free – Christian – German, are to the pope and the Roman court nothing but mere poison, death, devil and hell. They can neither suffer, see nor hear them. Nothing else will come of it, that is certain."" (Against the papacy donated by the devil in Rome, 1645) ''The Myth of the Twentieth Century'' (1930) p.622&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=notes&gt;Rosenberg wrote: "In all seriousness, the Cosmic God was said to be identical with the dubious spiritual assertions of the Old Testament! Hebrew polytheism was elevated to a model of monotheism, and no deeper knowledge had come to Lutheran theology from the original magnificent Aryan-Persian idea of the world and the cosmic comprehension of God. In addition there appeared the revering of Paul, an original sin of protestantism, against which [[Paul de Lagarde|Lagarde]], as is known, attacked by the entire official theology of his day, fought in vain." ''The Myth of the Twentieth Century'' (1930) p.11&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=notes&gt;Rosenberg wrote: "However richly talented, however powerful and surpassing in forms it was, until the present, we have still not created a religious form worthy of us: neither [[Francis of Assisi]], [[Martin Luther|Luther]], [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]] nor [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky|Dostoyevsky]] are founders of a religion for us." ''The Myth of the Twentieth Century'' (1930) p.441&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 1934 Hitler had appointed Rosenberg as the cultural and educational leader of the Reich.&lt;ref name="William L. Shirer p240"&gt;[[William L. Shirer|Shirer, William L.]] (1960) ''[[The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich]]'' London: Secker &amp; Warburg; London. p.240&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Nazi War Against the Catholic Church''; National Catholic Welfare Conference; Washington D.C.; 1942&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith|Sanctum Officium]]'' in Rome recommended that Rosenberg's ''Myth of the Twentieth Century'' be put on the ''[[Index Librorum Prohibitorum]]'' (list of books forbidden by the Catholic Church) for scorning and rejecting "all dogmas of the Catholic Church, indeed the very fundamentals of the Christian religion".&lt;ref&gt;

During World War II Rosenberg outlined the future envisioned by the Hitler government for religion in Germany, with a thirty-point program for the future of the German churches. Among its articles:

* the National Reich Church of Germany would claim exclusive control over all churches
* publication of the Bible would cease
* crucifixes, Bibles and saints were to be removed from altars
* ''Mein Kampf'' would be placed on altars as "to the German nation and therefore to God the most sacred book"
* the Christian Cross would be removed from all churches and replaced with the swastika.&lt;ref name="William L. Shirer p240"/&gt;

==Wartime activities==

In 1940 Rosenberg was made head of the ''[[Hohe Schule der NSDAP|Hohe Schule]]'' (literally "high school", but the German phrase refers to a college), the Centre of National Socialist Ideological and Educational Research, out of which the ''[[Reichsleiter Rosenberg Taskforce|Einsatzstab Reichsleiter Rosenberg]]'' developed for the purpose of looting art and cultural goods. The ERR were especially active in Paris in looting art stolen from famous Jewish families such as the [[Rothschilds]] and that of [[Paul Rosenberg (art dealer)|Paul Rosenberg]]. [[Hermann Göring]] used the ERR to collect art for his own personal gratification.&lt;ref&gt;Löhr, Hanns Christian (2018): '' Kunst als Waffe – Der Einsatzstab Reichsleiter Rosenberg, Ideologie und Kunstraub im „Dritten Reich“'', Gebr. Mann, p. 38 ff. {{ISBN|978-3-7861-2806-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;
He created a "Special Task Force for Music" (''Sonderstab Musik'') to collect the best [[musical instrument]]s and scores for use in a university to be built in Hitler's home town of [[Linz]], [[Austria]]. The orders given to the ''Sonderstab Musik'' were to loot all forms of Jewish property in Germany and of those found in any country taken over by the German army, and any musical instruments or scores were to be immediately shipped to [[Berlin]].&lt;ref&gt;Vries, Willem de (2000): Kunstraub im Westen, Alfred Rosenberg und der ''Sonderstab Musik'', S.Fischer Verlag. {{ISBN|3-596-14768-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reich Minister for the Occupied Eastern Territories===
Following [[Operation Barbarossa|the invasion]] of the [[Soviet Union|USSR]], Rosenberg was appointed head of the [[Reich Ministry for the Occupied Eastern Territories]] (''Reichsministerium für die besetzten Ostgebiete''). [[Alfred Meyer]] served as his deputy and represented him at the [[Wannsee Conference]]. Another official of the Ministry, [[Georg Leibbrandt]], also attended the conference, at Rosenberg's request.

Rosenberg had presented Hitler with his plan for the organization of the conquered Eastern territories, suggesting the establishment of new administrative districts, to replace the previously [[Soviet Union|Soviet]]-controlled territories with new [[Reichskommissar]]iats. These would be:

* ''[[Reichskommissariat Ostland|Ostland]]'' ([[Baltic countries]] and [[Belarus]]),
* ''[[Reichskommissariat Ukraine|Ukraine]]'' ([[Ukraine]] and nearest territories),
* ''[[Reichskommissariat Kaukasus|Kaukasus]]'' ([[Caucasus]] area),
* ''[[Reichskommissariat Moskau|Moskau]]'' (Moscow metropolitan area and the rest of nearest Russian European areas)

[[File:Alfred Rosenberg's office from 1942.jpg|thumb|left|Former Nazi Ministry for Occupied Eastern Territories, Berlin (2014)]]

Although Rosenberg regarded all the Soviet peoples as subhumans for their communist beliefs,&lt;ref&gt;[[David Irving|Irving, David]] (1996) ''Goebbels: Mastermind of the Third Reich'', London: Focal Point. p.769.  {{ISBN|1872197132}}&lt;/ref&gt; such suggestions were intended to encourage certain non-[[Russia]]n nationalism and to promote German interests for the benefit of future [[Aryan race|Aryan]] generations, in accord with geopolitical "[[Lebensraum]] im Osten" plans. They would provide a buffer against Soviet expansion in preparation for the total eradication of Communism and [[Bolshevism]] by decisive pre-emptive military action.

Following these plans, when [[Wehrmacht]] forces invaded Soviet-controlled territory, they immediately implemented the first of the proposed Reichskommissariats of [[Ostland]] and [[Ukraine]], under the leadership of [[Hinrich Lohse]] and [[Erich Koch]], respectively. The organization of these administrative territories led to conflict between Rosenberg and the [[SS]] over the treatment of [[Slavs]] under German occupation. As Nazi Germany's chief racial theorist, Rosenberg considered Slavs, though lesser than Germans, to be Aryan. Rosenberg often complained to Hitler and Himmler about the treatment of non-Jewish occupied peoples.&lt;ref name = "kev"&gt;Kevin P. Spicer, ''Antisemitism, Christian ambivalence, and the Holocaust'', Center for Advanced Holocaust Studies, Indiana University Press, 2007, p. 308&lt;/ref&gt; He proposed creation of buffer satellite states made out of Greater Finland, Baltica, Ukraine, and Caucasus.&lt;ref name="Russian Liberation Movement page 30"/&gt;

In an 18 November 1941 [[press conference]] speaking about the Jewish Question, he said:
{{quote|Some six million Jews still live in the East, and this question can only be solved by a biological extermination of the whole of Jewry in Europe. The Jewish Question will only be solved for Germany when the last Jew has left German territory, and for Europe when not a single Jew stands on the European continent as far as the Urals... And to this end it is necessary to force them beyond the Urals or otherwise bring about their eradication.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Longerich, Holocaust: The Nazi Persecution and Murder of the Jews, p.289&lt;/ref&gt;}}

He made no complaints about the murders of Jews. At the [[Nuremberg Trials]] he claimed to be ignorant of the [[Holocaust]], despite the fact that Leibbrandt and Meyer were present at the [[Wannsee conference]].&lt;ref name="jewishvirtuallibrary"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/biography/Leibbrandt.html|title=Georg Leibbrandt &amp;#124; Jewish Virtual Library|publisher=jewishvirtuallibrary.org|accessdate=10 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wartime propaganda efforts===
Since the invasion of the [[Soviet Union]] intended to impose the [[New Order (political system)|New Order]], it was essentially a war of conquest. German propaganda efforts designed to win over Russian opinion were, at best, patchy and inconsistent. Alfred Rosenberg was one of the few in the Nazi hierarchy who advocated a policy designed to encourage [[anti-Communist]] opinion among the population of the occupied territories. His interest here was mainly in the non-Russian areas such as Ukraine and the Baltic States; however, supporters of the [[Russian Liberation Army]] were somewhat able to win him over.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.feldgrau.com/rvol.html Russian Volunteers in the Wehrmacht]&lt;/ref&gt;

Amongst other things, Rosenberg issued a series of posters announcing the end of the Soviet collective farms (''[[kolkhoz]]''). He also issued an Agrarian Law in February 1942, annulling all Soviet legislation on farming and restoring family farms for those willing to collaborate with the occupiers. But decollectivisation conflicted with the wider demands of wartime food production, and [[Hermann Göring]] demanded that the collective farms be retained, save for a change of name. Hitler himself denounced the redistribution of land as "stupid".&lt;ref&gt;Leonid Grenkevich, ''The Soviet Partisan Movement, 1941–1945: A Critical Historiographical Analysis'', Routledge, New York, 1999, pp. 169–171.&lt;/ref&gt;

There were numerous German armed forces (''[[Wehrmacht]]'') posters asking for assistance in the ''Bandenkrieg,'' the war against the [[Soviet partisans]], though, once again, German policy had the effect of adding to their problems. Posters for "volunteer" labour, with inscriptions like "Come work with us to shorten the war", hid the appalling realities faced by [[OST-Arbeiter|Russian workers in Germany]]. Many people joined the partisans rather than risk being sent to an unknown fate in the west.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

Another of Rosenberg's initiatives, the "Free Caucasus" campaign, was rather more successful, attracting various nationalities into the so-called Eastern Legion (''[[Ostlegionen]]''), though in the end this made little difference in the outcome of the war on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]].

===Trial and execution===

Rosenberg was captured by [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] troops at the end of the war in [[Flensburg]]-[[Mürwik]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article99007254 |title=Allies Capture Nazi Pagan Philosopher. |newspaper=[[The Northern Star|Northern Star (Lismore, NSW : 1876–1954)]] |location=Lismore, NSW |date=22 May 1945 |accessdate=30 September 2013 |page=4 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was tried at [[Nuremberg Trials|Nuremberg]] and found guilty of all four counts: conspiracy to commit [[crimes against peace]]; planning, initiating and waging [[wars of aggression]]; [[war crimes]]; and [[crimes against humanity]]. The final judgment against him named him one of the principal planners of the invasions of [[Norwegian Campaign|Norway]] and the Soviet Union. It also held him directly responsible for the systematic plunder of the occupied countries of Europe, as well as the brutal conditions in Eastern Europe.&lt;ref name="yale"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://avalon.law.yale.edu/imt/judrosen.asp |title=The Avalon Project : Judgment : Rosenberg |publisher=avalon.law.yale.edu|accessdate=16 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his trial he wrote his memoirs, which were published posthumously and with analytical commentary by [[Serge Lang (skiing)|Serge Lang]] and Ernst von Schenck.&lt;ref name="Memoirs"&gt;{{cite book | others=Posselt, Eric, Lang, Serge and von Schenck, Ernst | url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/memoirs-of-alfred-rosenberg-with-commentaries/oclc/871198711 | title=Memoirs of Alfred Rosenberg, with commentaries | publisher=Ziff-Davis Publishing Company | author=Rosenberg, Alfred | year=1949 | location=Chicago | pages=328}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was sentenced to death and executed with other condemned co-defendants at Nuremberg Prison on the morning of 16 October 1946.&lt;ref name="ushmm"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/article.php?lang=en&amp;ModuleId=10007070 |title=International Military Tribunal: The Defendants |publisher=ushmm.org|accessdate=16 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; His body, like those of the other nine executed men and that of Hermann Göring, was cremated at [[Ostfriedhof (Munich)]] and the ashes were scattered in the river [[Isar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

Throughout the trial, it was agreed that Rosenberg had a decisive role in shaping Nazi philosophy and ideology. Examples include: his book ''[[Myth of the Twentieth Century]]'', which was published in 1930, where he incited hatred against "[[Liberal Imperialists|Liberal Imperialism]]" and "Bolshevik [[Marxism]]"; furthering the influence of the "[[Lebensraum]]" idea in Germany during the war; facilitating the persecution of Christian churches and the Jews in particular; and opposition to the Versailles Treaty.&lt;ref name="uwe"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ess.uwe.ac.uk/genocide/Rosenberg.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20000829090723/http://www.ess.uwe.ac.uk/genocide/Rosenberg.htm |archivedate=29 August 2000 |dead-url=yes |title=Alfred Rosenberg Nuremberg Charges |publisher=web.archive.org |accessdate=16 August 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tercer-reich.com/politicos/los-argumentos-de-la-defensa-de-alfred-rosenberg-y-fritz-sauckel-en-los-juicios-de-nuremberg/ Rosenberg case for the defense at Nuremberg trials] (Spanish)&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Joseph Kingsbury-Smith, who covered the executions for the [[International News Service]], Rosenberg was the only condemned man who, when asked at the gallows if he had any [[last statement]] to make, replied with only one word: "No".&lt;ref name="latimes"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1999/feb/06/local/me-5431 |title=J.

==Nazi policy and Rosenberg's views==
Hitler was a leader oriented towards practical politics, whereas, for Rosenberg, religion and philosophy were key and culturally he was the most influential within the party.&lt;ref name="Steigmann-Gall2003"&gt;{{cite book|author=Richard Steigmann-Gall|title=The Holy Reich: Nazi conceptions of Christianity, 1919–1945|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RreXLeUG_AIC&amp;pg=PA91|accessdate=24 October 2010|year=2003|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-82371-5|pages=91–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several accounts of the time before the Nazi ascension to power, indeed, speak of Hitler as being a mouthpiece for Rosenberg's views, and he clearly exerted a great deal of intellectual influence.&lt;ref&gt;Cecil, p.45&lt;/ref&gt;

The question of Rosenberg's influence in the Nazi Party is controversial. He was perceived as lacking the charisma and political skills of the other Nazi leaders, and was somewhat isolated. In some of his speeches Hitler appeared to be close to Rosenberg's views, rejecting traditional Christianity as a religion based on Jewish culture, preferring an ethnically and culturally pure "Race" whose destiny was supposed to be assigned to the German people by "Providence". In others, he adhered to the Nazi Party line, which advocated a "positive Christianity".

After Hitler's assumption of power he moved to reassure the Protestant and Catholic churches that the party was not intending to reinstitute [[Germanic paganism]]. He placed himself in the position of being the man to save Positive Christianity from utter destruction at the hands of the [[Religion in the Soviet Union|atheistic antitheist Communist]]s of the [[Soviet Union]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=9SBndd4Jc0QC|title=The 'Hitler Myth': Image and Reality in the Third Reich|author=Kershaw, Ian|year= 2001|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]

|quote = Hitler's evident ability to simulate, even to potentially critical Church leaders, an image of a leader keen to uphold and protect Christianity was crucial to the mediation of such an image to the church-going public by influential members of both major denominations. It was the reason why church-going Christians, so often encouraged by their 'opinion-leaders' in the Church hierarchies, were frequently able to exclude Hitler from their condemnation of the anti-Christian Party radicals, continuing to see in him the last hope of protecting Christianity from Bolshevism.
|authorlink= Ian Kershaw}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was especially true immediately before and after the elections of 1932; Hitler wanted to appear non-threatening to major Christian faiths and consolidate his power. Furthermore, Hitler felt that Catholic-Protestant infighting had been a major factor in weakening the German state and allowing its dominance by foreign powers.

Some Nazi leaders, such as [[Martin Bormann]], were [[anti-Christian]] and sympathetic to Rosenberg.&lt;ref&gt;Stiegmann-Gall, Richard, ''The Holy Reich'', CUP, pp. 243–5&lt;/ref&gt; Once in power, Hitler and most Nazi leaders sought to unify the Christian denominations in favor of "positive Christianity". Hitler privately condemned mystical and pseudoreligious interests as "nonsense".{{sfn|Speer|1971|pp=141,212}} However, he and [[Joseph Goebbels]] agreed that after the ''[[Endsieg]]'' (Final Victory) the [[Protestant Reich Church|Reich Church]] should be pressed into evolving into a German [[social evolutionism|social evolutionist]] organisation proclaiming the cult of race, blood and battle, instead of [[Redemption (religious)|Redemption]] and the [[Ten Commandments]] of [[Moses]], which they deemed outdated and Jewish.&lt;ref&gt;Hürten, H. "'Endlösung' für den Katholizismus? Das nationalsozialistische Regime und seine Zukunftspläne gegenüber der Kirche," in: ''[[Stimmen der Zeit]]'', 203 (1985) pp. 534–546&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Heinrich Himmler]]'s views were among the closest to Rosenberg's, and their estrangement was perhaps created by Himmler's abilities to put into action what Rosenberg had only written.&lt;ref name="cecil119"&gt;Cecil, p.119&lt;/ref&gt; Also, while Rosenberg thought Christianity should be allowed to die out, Himmler actively set out to create countering pagan rituals.&lt;ref name="cecil119"/&gt;

Lieutenant Colonel William Harold Dunn (1898–1955) wrote a medical and psychiatric report on him in prison to evaluate him as a suicide risk: &lt;blockquote&gt;He gave the impression of clinging to his own theories in a fanatical and unyielding fashion and to have been little influenced by the unfolding during the trial of the cruelty and crimes of the party.&lt;ref&gt;Cecil, p.219&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Summarizing the unresolved conflict between the personal views of Rosenberg and the pragmatism of the Nazi elite:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The ruthless pursuit of Nazi aims turned out to mean not, as Rosenberg had hoped, the permeation of German life with the new ideology; it meant concentration of the combined resources of party and state on [[total war]].&lt;ref&gt;Cecil, p.160&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Family life==
Rosenberg was married twice: to Hilda Leesmann (1891-1928), an ethnic [[Estonians|Estonian]], in 1915 (divorced in 1923),&lt;ref name="cecil52"&gt;Cecil, p.52&lt;/ref&gt; and to Hedwig Kramer in 1925,&lt;ref name="cecil52"/&gt; with whom he was married until his execution. He and Kramer had two children: a son who died in [[infancy]] and a daughter, Irene, who was born in 1930.&lt;ref&gt;Cecil, pp.52–3&lt;/ref&gt; Great-grandchild [http://kwidzynopedia.pl/index.php?title=Tytus_L_Rosenberg Tytus L Rosenberg] (born in 1974) in Poland.

===Diary===
Rosenberg's handwritten diary, which had been used in evidence during the Nuremberg trials, went missing after the war along with other material which had been given to the prosecutor [[Robert Kempner]] (1899–1993).&lt;ref name="natgeo"&gt;{{cite news | first = Charles | last = Fenyvesi | title = Mysteries of the Lost (and Found) Nazi Diaries | date = 14 June 2012 | work = National Geographic }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was recovered in Lewiston, N.Y., on 13 June 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wkbw.com/news/Federal-Officials-Reveal-Diary-of-High-Level-Nazi-Leader-Found-in-WNY-211415701.html Federal Officials Reveal Diary of High-Level Nazi Leader Found in WNY]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141015151512/http://www.wkbw.com/news/Federal-Officials-Reveal-Diary-of-High-Level-Nazi-Leader-Found-in-WNY-211415701.html |date=15 October 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Written on 425 loose-leaf pages, with entries dating from 1936 through 1944, it is now the property of the [[United States Holocaust Memorial Museum]] (USHMM) in Washington.&lt;ref name="natgeo"/&gt; Henry Mayer, the museum's senior archivist, and the son of a Holocaust survivor, was able to access the material and while "not given enough time to read [the] diary entry from beginning to end," he "could see that Rosenberg focused on certain subjects, including brutality against Jews and other ethnic groups and forcing the civilian population of occupied Russia to serve Germany."&lt;ref name="natgeo"/&gt;  Meyer also noted Rosenberg's "hostile comments about Nazi leaders," which he described as "unvarnished."&lt;ref name="natgeo"/&gt; While some parts of the manuscript had been previously published, the majority had been lost for decades.

The '''Biblical Archaeological Institute''' Wuppertal (BAI) was established in 1999 by the [[Protestant Church]] of the [[Rhineland]].
It constitutes an institute of the “Protestant University of Wuppertal” as well as an associated institute of the [[University of Wuppertal]] and holds the right to award doctorates at both universities.

The necessary [[financial endowment]] is provided by the “Friends of the BAI” (e.V.).

== Scientific aims==

Since 1999 four main objectives of research are being pursued. These comprehend:
* Excavation projects (especially in the Eastern Mediterranean)
* The application of modern methods in Archaeology - i.e. [[Geophysics]] ([[geoelectrics]] and [[tomography]]; [[geomagnetics]]; [[georadar]]) and terrestrial research ([[Photogrammetry]])
* [[Archaeometry]] (chemical and mineralogical pottery analysis; experimental firing of pottery); the main interest is to write a history of pottery production in the investigation area; since 2008 also research work on ancient glass and faience industry
* [[Experimental archaeology]] (Production of pottery replicas in historically correct manufacturing methods)

== Main archaeological projects==

=== Different projects ===

The Biblical Archaeological Institute has conducted excavations and geophysical research  in [[Italy]], [[Greece]], [[Israel]] and the Hashemite Kingdom of [[Jordan]].

* [[Villa Hadriana]] (Italy) 2002–2004
* Geophysical prospection in [[Olympia, Greece|Olympia]] (Greece) 2001
* Esch-Schallaf (Jordan) 1998–1999
* Ba'ja I, close to [[Petra]] (Jordan) 1999
* Sal (Jordan) 1999–2000

=== The Gadara Region Project and the Tall Zira'a ===

Since 2001 the institute's research focuses on the exploration of the Gadara region. The largest site in the area is the [[Tall Zira'a]] which comprises over 5000 years of settlement history.
At this place in 2001 a survey was conducted. In 2003 started the first excavation of a long term project which is scheduled until 2020. 
Since 2004 the [[German Protestant Institute of Archaeology]] [[Amman]] is a partner of the project. Since 2006 the corresponding institute in [[Jerusalem]] participates likewise.
The currently running excavation seasons are accomplished by a regional survey covering the greater Wadi al-'Arab area since 2009.

On the Tall Zira'a settlements from over more than five millennia are being excavated. Furthermore, the agricultural potential as well as flora and fauna, geology, hydrology, trade relations (roads, infrastructure) and the strategically importance of the Wadi al-Arab are being explored.

25&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; of the greater Wadi al-'Arab area (south of the ancient city of [[Gadara]]) were under research since 2009. In this area exist more than 100 sites which date from prehistory to the Islamic period.

With the help of archaeometrical methods the [[Artifact (archaeology)|artefacts]] from the Tall Zira'a are being examined concerning their respective materials. Thereby, the research concentrates on [[Pottery#Archaeology|pottery]], glass and [[faience]] to gain insight into the possible location of production sites and the technological knowledge.

The research described above goes hand in hand with [[experimental archaeology]], applying old techniques e.&amp;nbsp;g. of constructing a potters oven and firing the products.

The geophysical prospection of the Tall Zira'a used geoelectrical mapping, two-dimensional tomography and three-dimensional tomographical techniques to

* plan archaeological excavations in advance as exact as possible and devise appropriate methods of excavation,
* acquire knowledge concerning unexcavated areas and
* protect areas for future excavations.

== Director ==
[[Image:BAI-Wuppertal Uni Campus Freudenberg.JPG|thumb| BAI at Wuppertal University 2008]]

The first Director of the Biblical Archaeological Institute is [[Dieter Vieweger]] who was appointed in 1999. Since November 2005 he is also the Director of the [[German Protestant Institute of Archaeology]] in [[Jerusalem]] and [[Amman]]. He is professor at the Protestant University of Wuppertal as well as at the [[Witten/Herdecke University]].

== Location University of Wuppertal (Bergische Universität Wuppertal) ==

On 13 July 2003 the move-in of the BAI in the facilities of the Bergische Universität, Campus Freudenberg was ceremonially solemnized. The stuff of the BAI is mainly concerned with the archaeological research of the finds from the Tall Zira´a.

The BAI on the Campus Freudenberg of the Bergische Universität Wuppertal can easily be reached by car via A 1, A 46 and L 418. Public transport is being provided from Wuppertal central station by Bus "E". 
The institute is located on the 3rd floor of building FD.

'''Bristol Byzantine''' is a variety of [[Byzantine Revival architecture]] that was popular in the city of [[Bristol]] from about 1850 to 1880.

Many buildings in the style have been destroyed or demolished, but notable surviving examples include the [[Colston Hall]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=The Colston Hall  | work=Images of England | url=http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/details/default.aspx?id=379355 | accessdate=2007-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Granary, Bristol|Granary on Welsh Back]], the [[Carriage Works, Bristol |Carriage Works]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=No.104 The Carriage Works  | work=Images of England | url=http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/details/default.aspx?id=380632 | accessdate=2007-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; on [[Stokes Croft]] and several of the buildings around Victoria Street. Several of the warehouses around the harbour have survived including the [[Arnolfini]] which now houses an art gallery.&lt;ref name="Bush House"&gt;{{cite web | title=Bush House | work=Images of England | url=http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/details/default.aspx?id=380204 | accessdate=2006-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Clarks Wood Company warehouse]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= Clarks Wood Company warehouse | work=Images of England | url=http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/details/default.aspx?id=380529 | accessdate=2007-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[St Vincent's Works]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=St Vincent's Works and attached front area railings | work=Images of England | url=http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/details/default.aspx?id=380525 | accessdate=2007-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Silverthorne Lane and the [[Wool Hall, Bristol|Wool Hall]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=No.12 The Wool Hall, including the Fleece and Firkin Public House| work=Images of England | url=http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/details/default.aspx?id=380514 | accessdate=2007-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; in St Thomas Street are other survivors from the 19th century.

==Style==
Bristol Byzantine has influences from [[Byzantine architecture|Byzantine]] and [[Moorish architecture]] applied mainly to industrial buildings such as warehouses and factories.

The style is characterised by a robust and simple outline, materials with character and colour including red, yellow, black and white brick primarily from the [[Cattybrook Brickpit]].

Several buildings included archways and upper floors unified through either horizontal or vertical grouping of window openings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bristol Byzantine |work=Looking at Buildings |url=http://www.lookingatbuildings.org.uk/default.asp?Document=3.C.1.6 |accessdate=2007-05-19 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927234936/http://www.lookingatbuildings.org.uk/default.asp?Document=3.C.1.6 |archivedate=2007-09-27 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The first building with some of the characteristics generally thought of a Bristol Byzantine is Bush House, which is now known as the [[Arnolfini]] a 19th-century Grade II* [[listed building|listed]]&lt;ref name="Bush House" /&gt; [[tea]] warehouse situated on the side of the [[Floating Harbour]] in [[Bristol city centre]]. The architect was [[Richard Shackleton Pope]], who constructed first the south part of the warehouse (1831) then extended it to the north in 1835–36. It has a rock-faced plinth, three storeys of rectangular windows recessed within tall round arches, and a shallow attic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Bush House |work=Looking at Buildings |url=http://www.lookingatbuildings.org.uk/cities/bristol/bush-house.html |accessdate=2010-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The style may have come about as a result of an acquaintance between [[William Venn Gough]] and Archibald Ponton, who designed [[Granary, Bristol|the Granary]] and [[John Addington Symonds]] the Bristol-born historian of the [[Italian renaissance]]. The term Bristol Byzantine is thought to have been invented by Sir [[John Summerson]].&lt;ref name="Brace"&gt;{{cite book |last=Brace |first=Keith |title=Portrait of Bristol |year=1996 |publisher=Robert Hale |location=London |isbn=0-7091-5435-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditionally, the '''canon of Sherlock Holmes''' consists of the 56 [[short stories]] and four [[novels]] written by [[Sir Arthur Conan Doyle]].&lt;ref name="Doyle 1993"&gt;Peter Haining, "Introduction" in {{cite book | last = Doyle | first = Arthur Conan | title = The Final Adventures of Sherlock Holmes | publisher = Barnes &amp; Noble Books | location = New York | year = 1993 | isbn = 1-56619-198-X }} Edited by Peter Haining.&lt;/ref&gt; In this context, the term "[[canon (fiction)|canon]]" is an attempt to distinguish between Doyle's original works and [[Sherlock Holmes pastiches|subsequent works]] by other authors using the same characters.

==Canon==
{{wikisource|Sherlock Holmes}}

The traditional canon—usually capitalized by aficionados of the [[Sherlockian game]] as "the Canon"—consists of four novels and 56 short stories.

The description of these 60 adventures as the Sherlock Holmes [[Canon (fiction)|canon]] and the game of applying the methods of "[[Higher Criticism]]" to it was started by [[Ronald Knox]] as a playful use of the traditional definition of Canon as an authoritative list of books accepted as Holy Scripture.&lt;ref name=Sayers&gt;[[Dorothy L. Sayers]], ''Unpopular Opinions'' (London: Victor Gollancz, 1946), 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Novels==
The four novels of the canon:
#''[[A Study in Scarlet|'''A Study in Scarlet''']]'' (1887)
#''[[The Sign of the Four|'''The Sign of the Four''']]'' (1890)
#''[[The Hound of the Baskervilles|'''The Hound of the Baskervilles''']]'' (1901&amp;ndash;1902)
#''[[The Valley of Fear|'''The Valley of Fear''']]'' (1914&amp;ndash;1915)

==Short stories==
The 56 short stories are collected in five books:

# ''[[The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes|'''The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes''']]'' (1892)
# ''[[The Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes|'''The Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes''']]'' (1894)
# ''[[The Return of Sherlock Holmes|'''The Return of Sherlock Holmes''']]'' (1905)

==Extracanonical works==
Since the author's death, professional and amateur Holmesians have discussed endlessly the expansion of this canon, to include other works by Doyle, including works in other media, into the current complete adventures.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Haining, "Introduction" in {{cite book | last = Doyle | first = Arthur Conan | title = The Final Adventures of Sherlock Holmes | publisher = Barnes &amp; Noble Books | location = New York | year = 1993 | isbn = 1-56619-198-X | pages = 8–9}} Edited by Peter Haining.&lt;/ref&gt;  Rumours have always surrounded lost works,&lt;ref name="Doyle 1993"/&gt; and in recent years further investigations have revealed more to the traditionally collected canon. As there exists no definitive body to argue what is, and what is not canon beyond the already established novels and stories, it is unlikely that any piece, no matter how good its claim to be "canonical" will ever be popularly received into published versions of the Complete Sherlock Holmes. However, as many as eighteen works have been cited as possible entrants. These works include plays, poems, essays on the character, and even short stories.

Published collections of extracanonical works include: ''Sherlock Holmes: The Published Apocrypha'', edited by Jack Tracy; ''The Final Adventures of Sherlock Holmes'', edited by [[Peter Haining (author)|Peter Haining]]; ''The Uncollected Sherlock Holmes'', edited by [[Richard Lancelyn Green]]; and the final volume of [[Leslie S. Klinger]]'s ''Sherlock Holmes Reference Library'' titled ''The Apocrypha of Sherlock Holmes''. These works, each with slightly different contents, discussed several titles and their place in the canon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ihearofsherlock.com/2014/06/classics-of-sherlockiana-apocrypha-of.html |title=Classics of Sherlockiana: the Apocrypha of Sherlock Holmes |last=O'Leary |first=James C. |work=I Hear of Sherlock Everywhere |date=2014-06-04 |accessdate=2016-11-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Works by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle==

In addition to the canon, Conan Doyle wrote (occasionally with a co-writer) a number of vignettes, play adaptations and essays involving Holmes, and two short stories in which Holmes makes a possible cameo appearance. Most were published in various places during his lifetime; another has only come to light since his death. These are listed below with further detail.

===Short stories===

===={{Anchor|Field Bazaar|reason=Arthur Conan Doyle bibliography links here}} "The Field Bazaar" (1896)====

{{main article|The Field Bazaar}}
"The Field Bazaar" was written for an [[Edinburgh University]] fundraising event. Doyle had been requested by his university to contribute a short piece of literature for a charity magazine. In the story Watson has received a similar request and whilst he reads the letter at breakfast, Holmes correctly deduces the sender of the letter and Watson's thoughts with regard to the letter. It shares many similarities to the canonical stories. Aside from the metafictional twist in which Watson supplants Doyle as the author publishing his own stories in a magazine, it also plays not only about the famous skill of Holmes' observations producing apparently miraculous results, but also upon the notion of the "traditional breakfast scenes" which open many Holmes short stories.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Lancelyn Green, "Introduction" in {{cite book | last = Green | first = Richard Lancelyn | title = The Further Adventures of Sherlock Holmes | publisher = Penguin | location = London | year = 1986 | isbn = 0-14-007907-6  | page = 14}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Stories of Sherlock Holmes]]'', which ran on [[Springbok Radio]] in South Africa from 1979 to 1985, used the title &amp; plot as a beginning to one of their own episodes in which Holmes &amp; Watson travel to Watson's Alma Mater to solve a murder on a cricket pitch.

===="The Story of the Lost Special" (1898)====
{{main article|The Story of the Lost Special}}
Though Doyle had killed off his character by 1894, he still wrote other short stories for publication in the ''[[Strand Magazine]]'', including "The Story of the Lost Special", a seemingly inexplicable mystery in which a special train and its few passengers disappear between two stations. After the mystery is described in full, it is stated that a letter appeared in the press, giving a proposed solution from "an amateur reasoner of some celebrity". It is possible, and has been proposed by Haining, Tracy, and Green, amongst others that this "amateur reasoner" was Sherlock Holmes. The strongest clue to this is the quotation, "once one has eliminated the impossible...", used by Holmes throughout his deductions. However, this suggested solution is proved wrong by a confession from the organising criminal once he is later arrested for an unrelated crime. Haining suggested that Doyle was "getting out some Holmes" during the series hiatus, but given the failure of the unnamed detective it appears he was parodying his most famous creation. The story was published in book form in Arthur Conan Doyle’s ''Tales of Terror and Mystery'' in 1923 and has for years appeared in French editions of the complete adventures.&lt;ref name="Doyle 1993 14–15"&gt;Peter Haining, "Introduction" in {{cite book | last = Doyle | first = Arthur Conan | title = The Final Adventures of Sherlock Holmes | publisher = Barnes &amp; Noble Books | location = New York | year = 1993 | isbn = 1-56619-198-X | pages = 14–15}} Edited by Peter Haining.&lt;/ref&gt;

===="The Story of the Man with the Watches" (1898)====
Like "The Story of the Lost Special", "The Story of the Man with the Watches" appeared in the ''Strand'' (in 1898), and later in ''Round the Fire Stories'' and ''Tales of Terror and Mystery''. It follows the same pattern; the mystery this time surrounds the appearance of a dead man in a railway carriage, with six pocket watches in his jacket. An explanation is offered by an amateur detective but the narrator notes it is flawed, as it doesn't take into account all the facts. A man involved in the accidental murder of the victim writes a letter to the detective, saying that it was a "mighty clever solution" but entirely incorrect and continues to share the true events of that day. It shares the same backing for categorising as a Sherlock Holmes story as "The Story of the Lost Special", and appears in French anthologies.&lt;ref name="Doyle 1993 14–15"/&gt; The story was adapted for [[BBC Radio 4]] in 2009 as "The Thirteen Watches", in an episode from ''[[The Further Adventures of Sherlock Holmes]]''. The number of watches was changed because the new title came from a reference (in the Holmes story "[[The Noble Bachelor]]") to Holmes' involvement with the watches incident.

===={{Anchor|Tall Man|reason=Arthur Conan Doyle bibliography links here}} Plot for Sherlock Holmes Story (c. 1900)====
When searching through Conan Doyle’s papers, [[Hesketh Pearson]], a biographer of his, came across a plan for an unwritten story. As Richard Lancelyn Green notes, "there is no evidence to show that it is by [Conan Doyle] and strong internal evidence to suggest that it's not".&lt;ref&gt;Richard Lancelyn Green, in {{cite book | last = Doyle | first = Arthur Conan | title = The Uncollected Sherlock Holmes | publisher = Penguin Books | year = 1983 | isbn = 014006432-X | page = 357}}. Edited by Richard Lancelyn Green.&lt;/ref&gt; Various authors have attempted to complete the story (named "The Adventure of the Tall Man" by Peter Haining) and put it alongside the canon. Some are very close to Doyle’s plot, others include variations from it.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Haining, "Introduction" in {{cite book | last = Doyle | first = Arthur Conan | title = The Final Adventures of Sherlock Holmes | publisher = Barnes &amp; Noble Books | location = New York | year = 1993 | isbn = 1-56619-198-X | page = 16}} Edited by Peter Haining.&lt;/ref&gt;  However no 'official' completion has been made (In the same way as ''[[The Exploits of Sherlock Holmes]]'' was intended as an official continuation of the canon).

===={{Anchor|How Watson Learned the Trick|reason=Arthur Conan Doyle bibliography links here}} "How Watson Learned the Trick" (1924)====
{{main article|How Watson Learned the Trick}}
In 1922, several authors were approached to contribute to the library of [[Queen Mary's Dolls' House]]. Conan Doyle wrote a short Sherlock Holmes story, just 503 words long, onto the tiny pages of a specially constructed miniature book: "How Watson Learned the Trick". The story was later published alongside works by other authors in ''The Book of the Queen's Dolls' House Library'' (1924). Though written 28 years after "The Field Bazaar", this is almost a companion piece to that story. Like "The Field Bazaar", this story is a breakfast scene, during which Watson attempts to mimic Holmes' style in guessing his thoughts. Watson's intuitions are proved wrong, however. Unlike almost all parts of the Sherlock Holmes story it is written in the third person, presumably due to its length.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Haining, "Introduction" in {{cite book | last = Doyle | first = Arthur Conan | title = The Final Adventures of Sherlock Holmes | publisher = Barnes &amp; Noble Books | location = New York | year = 1993 | isbn = 1-56619-198-X | pages = 21–23}} Edited by Peter Haining.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sherlock Holmes on stage===
'''''Angels of Darkness''''' (c. 1889)

Unpublished until 2000, this play was written shortly after ''A Study in Scarlet'' was published. It is essentially a rewrite of the American chapters of ''A Study in Scarlet'', with the London action moving to San Francisco. Holmes is not present, but Watson is, in a very different form. He acts discreditably and even marries another woman. The publication of this play was at first suppressed, Doyle’s biographer, [[John Dickson Carr]] stated that it would do no good for the public to read this, a view that Haining endorses readily.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Haining, "Introduction" in {{cite book | last = Doyle | first = Arthur Conan | title = The Final Adventures of Sherlock Holmes | publisher = Barnes &amp; Noble Books | location = New York | year = 1993 | isbn = 1-56619-198-X | pages = 10–11}} Edited by Peter Haining.&lt;/ref&gt; The play is notable for its contrasting sensationalist and comic scenes, and it is contained in Klinger's Apocrypha.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

'''''Sherlock Holmes: A Drama in Four Acts''''' (or '''''Sherlock Holmes''''') (1899)
{{main article|Sherlock Holmes (play)}}
The original Sherlock Holmes play written by Arthur Conan Doyle and [[William Gillette]] had a successful run of over 30 years. It has many original parts which are not found in the short stories but borrows many events from the canonical adventures, namely "[[A Scandal in Bohemia]]" and "[[The Adventure of the Final Problem]]". Also, it had elements from ''[[A Study in Scarlet]]'', ''[[The Sign of the Four|The Sign of Four]]'', "[[The Boscombe Valley Mystery]]", "[[The Adventure of the Greek Interpreter]]", and "[[The Adventure of the Naval Treaty]]". It includes the very first mention of the phrase "Elementary, my dear Watson". While Conan Doyle wrote the original version, it is unclear how much of his material survived in the play as performed, which was written by Gillette. Conan Doyle and Gillette later revised the play together; it has since been revised by others twice.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

'''''The Speckled Band''''' (or '''''The Stonor Case''''') (1902)

Around 1902, Doyle wrote and produced a play based on his short story "[[The Adventure of the Speckled Band]]".  It premièred 8 years later, at the [[Adelphi Theatre]], [[London]] on 4 June 1910, with H. A. Saintsbury as Sherlock Holmes and [[Lyn Harding]] as Dr. Grimesby Roylott. The play, originally entitled ''The Stonor Case'', differs from the story in several small details, such as the names of some of the characters.&lt;ref name=Green&gt;{{cite book | last = Green | first = Richard Lancelyn | title = The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes | publisher = [[Oxford University Press]] | year = 1998 |chapter = Explanatory Notes | pages = 361–367 | isbn = 0-19-283508-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Crown Diamond: An Evening With Mr Sherlock Holmes''''' (1921)

"The Crown Diamond" is an alternate version of the short story "[[The Adventure of the Mazarin Stone]]" though it predates its counterpart by some time,&lt;ref&gt;Peter Haining, "Introduction" in {{cite book | last = Doyle | first = Arthur Conan | title = The Final Adventures of Sherlock Holmes | publisher = Barnes &amp; Noble Books | location = New York | year = 1993 | isbn = 1-56619-198-X | page = 21}} Edited by Peter Haining.&lt;/ref&gt; Sometime during the original run the short story was adapted from the play, this is the reason that the narrative is told in third person rather than by the traditional narrator Watson. Some claim that the play originally appeared in an early draft of "Sherlock Holmes" (above) and was later removed, with some elements finding their way into "[[The Adventure of the Empty House]]" before the entire play was resurrected, some years later, into "The Crown Diamond" and "The Mazarin Stone."

===Essays and retrospectives===
Arthur Conan Doyle rarely gave interviews or publicly discussed his character. However, the following is a list of Conan Doyle essays on his character which are currently in publication, either in Green or Haining's book or in standard editions of the ''Complete Stories'':

'''"To An Undiscerning Critic"''' (1912)

Guiterman first published his homage in ''America in Life'' (5 December 1912) and then in ''[[London Opinion]]'' (14 December 1912), and in his collection ''The Laughing Muse''. Conan Doyle’s answer appeared in the 26 December 1912 issue of ''London Opinion'' and was reprinted in the memoir of the editor of ''London Opinion'', Lincoln Springfield.  The late Dean Dickensheet appears to be the first to print the poems together, in ''An ‘Undiscerning Critic’ Discerned''.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

'''"Some Personalia about Mr. Sherlock Holmes"''' (1917)

This essay was featured in the ''Strand Magazine'' as a Christmas treat to its readers. It talks of the way Holmes had caught the public imagination and Conan Doyle’s view on his character.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Lancelyn Green, in {{cite book | last = Doyle | first = Arthur Conan | title = The Uncollected Sherlock Holmes | publisher = Penguin Books | year = 1983 | isbn = 014006432-X | pages = 277–283}} Edited by Richard Lancelyn Green.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''"The Truth About Sherlock Holmes"''' (1923)

An essay from ''Collier's Weekly'', in which Doyle explains exactly where Holmes came from. It contains, at the end, J. M. Barrie’s "The Adventure of the Two Collaborators".&lt;ref&gt;Peter Haining, "Introduction" in {{cite book | last = Doyle | first = Arthur Conan | title = The Final Adventures of Sherlock Holmes | publisher = Barnes &amp; Noble Books | location = New York | year = 1993 | isbn = 1-56619-198-X | page = 12}} Edited by Peter Haining.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''"Mr. Sherlock Holmes to His Readers"''' (1927)

This appeared in ''The Strand Magazine'' to introduce a competition to name the best Sherlock Holmes adventures. The same essay, with two paragraphs cut, appears as the preface to  ''The Case-Book of Sherlock Holmes''.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

'''"How I Made My List"''' (1927)

This is the sequel to the article mentioned above. In it, Conan Doyle listed what he thought were the best Holmes adventures. He noted that had he been able to include stories from ''The Case-Book of Sherlock Holmes'' he would certainly have included "[[The Adventure of the Lion's Mane]]" and "[[The Adventure of the Illustrious Client]]".&lt;ref&gt;Richard Lancelyn Green, in {{cite book | last = Doyle | first = Arthur Conan | title = The Uncollected Sherlock Holmes | publisher = Penguin Books | year = 1983 | isbn = 014006432-X | pages = 317–320}} Edited by Richard Lancelyn Green.&lt;/ref&gt; The list is as follows:

#"[[The Adventure of the Speckled Band]]"
#"[[The Red-Headed League]]"
#"[[The Adventure of the Dancing Men]]"
#"[[The Adventure of the Final Problem]]"
#"[[A Scandal in Bohemia]]"
#"[[The Adventure of the Empty House]]"
#"[[The Five Orange Pips]]"
#"[[The Adventure of the Second Stain]]"
#"[[The Adventure of the Devil's Foot]]"
#"[[The Adventure of the Priory School]]"
#"[[The Adventure of the Musgrave Ritual]]"
#"[[The Adventure of the Reigate Squire]]"

Richard Lancelyn Green's ''The Uncollected Sherlock Holmes'' also includes five prefaces to the various editions of Sherlock Holmes stories and novels, Conan Doyle's speech at the Stoll Convention Dinner (1921), some chapters from Conan Doyle's autobiography ''Memoirs and Adventures'', and several interviews.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

==Works of interest by other authors==
These are works which have in the past been thought to have been written by Conan Doyle. Some have been conclusively proved to have no Conan Doyle input, the composition of others still remains unclear.

===''The Exploits of Sherlock Holmes''===
{{Main|The Exploits of Sherlock Holmes}}

''[[The Exploits of Sherlock Holmes]]'', is a collection of stories written by Conan Doyle's son [[Adrian Conan Doyle]] and Arthur's biographer, novelist [[John Dickson Carr]]. The stories are generally extrapolations of cases briefly mentioned in the canonical work, but tend to contradict themselves and each other. They are generally considered [[Sherlock Holmes pastiches]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Doyle|first1=Steven|last2=Crowder|first2=David A.|title=Sherlock Holmes For Dummies|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FTs85BS6IeYC&amp;pg=PA245|year=2010|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-0-470-48444-9|page=245}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Short stories===

'''"The Case of the Man Who Was Wanted"''' (c. 1914)

This mystery, a completed Sherlock Holmes story, was found in 1942 by a Conan Doyle biographer, Hesketh Pearson, searching through a box of Conan Doyle's papers. It was originally announced that the story would not be published by the Doyle estate, but it was announced it certainly was by Doyle, as the manuscript supposedly appeared in his own handwriting. However, according to Jon L. Lellenberg in ''Nova 57 Minor'', the manuscript was not in Conan Doyle's handwriting, but typewritten. The ''Strand Magazine'' published extracts from it in August 1943, and it was finally published after demand from Sherlock Holmes societies in 1947, when it was embraced as a new (if slightly inferior) part of the canon by [[The Baker Street Irregulars]] amongst others.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Lancelyn Green, "Introduction" in {{cite book | last = Green | first = Richard Lancelyn | title = The Further Adventures of Sherlock Holmes | publisher = Penguin | location = London | year = 1986 | isbn = 0-14-007907-6  | page = 16}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Initial suspicions of forgery were reported by Vincent Starret&lt;ref&gt;Richard Lancelyn Green, "Introduction" in {{cite book | last = Green | first = Richard Lancelyn | title = The Further Adventures of Sherlock Holmes | publisher = Penguin | location = London | year = 1986 | isbn = 0-14-007907-6  | page = 17}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it was eventually discovered by Hesketh Pearson that the story was originally written by Arthur Whitaker, who had sent it to Conan Doyle in hope of a collaboration. Doyle had bought the story, in the thought that he might use the idea at a later date, but he never did. Pearson, Green, Tracy and the Doyle estate agree that Whitaker wrote the story, though Haining still claims that “the opening scene between Holmes and Watson betrays the hand of the master,” and that the story is partly written by Conan Doyle. He points out that Doyle's wife, sons and biographer were fooled by the style, and it is possible there was a redraft made.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Haining, "Introduction" in {{cite book | last = Doyle | first = Arthur Conan | title = The Final Adventures of Sherlock Holmes | publisher = Barnes &amp; Noble Books | location = New York | year = 1993 | isbn = 1-56619-198-X | pages = 18–19}} Edited by Peter Haining.&lt;/ref&gt; The story is published in Penguin's ''The Further Adventures of Sherlock Holmes'' collection under the title of "The Adventure of the Sheffield Banker."

'''"The Adventure of the Two Collaborators"''' (first published 1923)

Though never claimed by any serious critic to be a Conan Doyle work, this parody is listed here due to a popular misconception that this was written by Doyle for his friend, [[J. M. Barrie]] (of ''[[Peter Pan]]'' fame). (Perhaps contributing to this misconception is the fact that the story appears for the first time only in a work of Conan Doyle's, and all subsequent printings are from that source.) In fact, this story was written by Barrie for Doyle following a period of the two of them working together on a play. The story itself involves Doyle and Barrie visiting Holmes, with Doyle killing Holmes due to his irritating intelligence (which perhaps reflects Doyle's killing off of the character in "[[The Adventure of the Final Problem]]").

===Sherlock Holmes on stage===

'''''The Painful Predicament of Mr Sherlock Holmes''''' (1905)

The recognition of William Gillette as Sherlock Holmes was growing as a result of the success of the play ''Sherlock Holmes''. Playing upon his most famous role, a short comedy sketch performed by William Gillette as a curtain raiser to an unrelated play. It involves a mute Sherlock Holmes, and a very talkative client. In Haining and Tracy’s books, they speculate as to whether or not this play was written by Arthur Conan Doyle. Certainly Gillette would have needed Doyle’s consent to write an original work involving Sherlock Holmes, as the character was under copyright, but it is presumed by most Sherlockians that Gillette wrote the whole thing himself. Haining, however claims that Gillette may have asked Doyle to ‘whip up something quickly for him’. However, no manuscript exists in Doyle’s hand, and no reference of the play is left by him, it has been assumed by most that it is little more than a William Gillette curiosity.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Haining, "Introduction" in {{cite book | last = Doyle | first = Arthur Conan | title = The Final Adventures of Sherlock Holmes | publisher = Barnes &amp; Noble Books | location = New York | year = 1993 | isbn = 1-56619-198-X | pages =16–18}} Edited by Peter Haining.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Chojolom''' is a small [[Maya civilization|Maya]] archaeological site in the western [[Guatemalan Highlands|highlands]] of [[Guatemala]]. The site features a number of sculpted stones that are presumed to belong to the [[K'iche' Kingdom of Q'umarkaj|K'iche Maya culture]] of the [[Mesoamerican chronology|Postclassic Period]] (approximately AD 900&amp;ndash;1520).&lt;ref&gt;Rodas 2010-09-18.&lt;/ref&gt; Chojolom is situated on a hill in the municipality of [[Cantel, Guatemala|Cantel]], in the [[Departments of Guatemala|department]] of [[Quetzaltenango Department|Quetzaltenango]].&lt;ref&gt;Rodas 2010-09-18. Rodríguez Rouanet et al 1992, p.2.&lt;/ref&gt; The municipality is inhabited by [[K'iche' people|K'iche' Maya]] to this day, who make up 93.8% of the local population.&lt;ref&gt;Anonymous 2010-09-18. Servicio de Información Municipal.&lt;/ref&gt; Cantel is located {{convert|10|km|mi}} from the modern city of [[Quetzaltenango]] at Kilometer 217 on the CA2 Highway.&lt;ref&gt;Inforpressca, p.6.&lt;/ref&gt; Chojolom is believed to have been a ritual site.&lt;ref&gt;Rodas 2010-09-18.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Chojolom'' means "by the head" in the [[K'iche' language|K'iche' Maya language]], deriving from the root word ''jolom'' ("head").&lt;ref&gt;Rodas 2010-09-18. Christenson, p.46.&lt;/ref&gt; Local historian Mariano Cornejo has speculated that the depositing of the stone heads and the naming of the hill may be linked.&lt;ref&gt;Rodas 2010-09-18.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sculptures==
{{Maya civilization}}
As of September 2010 three sculpted stone heads have been found at the site; one of an armadillo, one human and one representing a [[List of Maya gods and supernatural beings|deity]].&lt;ref&gt;Rodas 2010-09-18.&lt;/ref&gt; The heads were discovered when mud was cleared away after a period of heavy rain in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;Rodas 2010-09-18.&lt;/ref&gt; One of the stone heads was found in a cave at the site.&lt;ref&gt;Rodas 2010-09-18.&lt;/ref&gt; Ceramics and bones have also been found, which may represent a ritual offering.&lt;ref&gt;Rodas 2010-09-18.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the stone heads, a clay head has also been found.&lt;ref&gt;Rodas 2010-09-18.&lt;/ref&gt; A minor landslide in October 2010 revealed a stone altar under a tree root.&lt;ref&gt;Rodas 2010-10-05.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Armadillo Head''' measures approximately {{convert|15|by|20|cm|in}}.&lt;ref&gt;Rodas 2010-09-18.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[nine-banded armadillo]] (''Dasypus novemcinctus'') is native to the Cantel region.&lt;ref&gt;Rodas 2010-09-18. Corporación Municipal 2001, p.14.&lt;/ref&gt; The Armadillo Head was the first of the three stone heads to have been found by local farmer Sebastián Sam.&lt;ref&gt;Anonymous 2010-09-18.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Human Head''' measures {{convert|50|by|50|cm|in}}.&lt;ref&gt;Rodas 2010-09-18.&lt;/ref&gt; It was the second stone head to be discovered at Chojolom.&lt;ref&gt;Rodas 2010-09-18.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Deity Head''' is the largest sculpture, measuring {{convert|1.1|by|1.4|m|ft}}.&lt;ref&gt;Rodas 2010-09-18.&lt;/ref&gt; It was the third stone head to be found at the site.&lt;ref&gt;Rodas 2010-09-18.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Altar''' measures {{convert|25|by|50|cm|in}} and bears designs that include circles, hills, human figures and a deer.&lt;ref&gt;Rodas 2010-10-05.&lt;/ref&gt; The combination of six human figures with the deer has been interpreted as a [[Maya calendar|Maya calendrical date]] by Guatemalan anthropologist Lina Barrios.&lt;ref&gt;Rodas 2010-10-05.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Inkunabel.ValMax.finis.detail.jpg|thumb|A colophon printed in 1471]]

In publishing, a '''colophon''' is a brief statement containing information about the publication of a book such as the place of publication, the publisher, and the date of publication. A colophon may also be emblematic or pictorial in nature. Colophons were formerly printed at the ends of books, but in modern works they are usually located at the [[Recto and verso|verso]] of the title-leaf.

==History==
[[File:Dictionary with colophon-AO 7661-IMG 0190-black.jpg|thumb|upright|Clay tablet: dictionary with colophon indicating storage emplacement in a library. From Warka, ancient [[Uruk]], mid 1st century BC. On display at the [[Louvre]].]]
The term ''colophon'' derives from the [[Late Latin]] ''colophōn'', from the [[Greek language|Greek]] κολοφών (meaning "summit" or "finishing touch").&lt;ref name=OED&gt;{{cite book|contribution=colophon, ''n.''|editor=James A[ugustus] H[enry] Murray|editor-link=James Murray (lexicographer)|title=The Oxford English Dictionary: A New English Dictionary on Historical Principles Founded Mainly on the Materials Collected by the Philological Society [Vol. II, C–Czech]|location=Oxford|publisher=[[Oxford University Press|Clarendon Press]]|year=1888–1893|oclc=460661449}}&lt;/ref&gt; It should not be confused with [[Colophon (city)|Colophon]], an ancient city in [[Asia Minor]], after which "colophony", or [[rosin]] (ronnel), is named.

The existence of colophons can be dated back to antiquity. Zetzel, for example, describes an inscription from the 2nd century A.D., transmitted in humanistic manuscripts. He cites the colophon from Poggio's manuscript, a humanist from the 15th century:&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schiegg|first1=Markus|title=Scribes' Voices: The Relevance and Types of Early Medieval Colophons|journal=Studia Neophilologica|date=2016|volume=88|issue=2|pages=129–147|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis, The British Library Board|language=English|issn=0039-3274}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Statili(us) / maximus rursum em(en)daui ad tyrone(m) et laecanianu(m) et dom̅ &amp; alios ueteres. III.''

(''‘I, Statilius Maximus, have for the second time revised the text according to Tiro, Laecanianus, Domitius and three others.’'')

Colophons can be categorized into four groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schiegg|first1=Markus|title=Scribes' Voices: The Relevance and Types of Early Medieval Colophons|journal=Studia Neophilologica|date=2016|volume=88 |issue=2|pages=129–147|series=British Library Document Supply Centre Inside Serials &amp; Conference Proceedings|publisher=Sweden: Taylor &amp; Francis|location=EBSCOhost|issn=0039-3274}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Assertive'' colophons provide the contextual information about the scribe and manuscript. ''Expressive'' colophons demonstrate the scribe's feelings and wishes. ''Directive'' colophons make the reader do something, and the ''declarative'' colophons do something with the reader.

Example of ''expressive'' colophons:

''Finit dicendo: Ludid. Quicunque scriptor scribit / Leti ut scribunt scribae.''

("He finishes saying, “Every scribe who writes has fun, for writing scribes are happy ones”.)

Example of ''directive'' colophons:

''O beatissime lector, lava manus tuas et sic librum adprehende, leniter folia turna, longe a littera digito pone''.

("O most gracious reader, wash your hands and touch the book only like this: turn the pages softly and keep your finger far away from the text".)

Example of ''directive'' and ''declarative'' colophons:

''Si quis et hunc sancti sumit de culmine galli / Hunc Gallus paulusque simul dent pestibus amplis''

("If anybody takes this book from Gall’s estate, Gall and Paulus together shall inflict the plague upon him".)&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

The term is also applied to [[clay tablet]] inscriptions appended by a [[scribe]] to the end of an [[Ancient Near East]] (''e.g.'', Early/Middle/Late [[Babylon]]ian, [[Assyria]]n, [[Canaan]]ite) text such as a chapter, book, manuscript, or record. The colophon usually contained facts relative to the text such as associated person(s) (''e.g.'', the scribe, owner, or commissioner of the tablet), literary contents (''e.g.'', a [[title (publishing)|title]], "catch phrases" (repeated phrases), or number of lines), and occasion or purpose of writing. Colophons and catch phrases helped the reader organize and identify various tablets, and keep related tablets together. Positionally, colophons on ancient tablets are comparable to a signature line in modern times. Bibliographically, however, they more closely resemble the [[title page#Title pages in books|imprint page]] in a modern book.

Examples of colophons in ancient literature may be found in the compilation ''The Ancient Near East: Supplementary Texts and Pictures Relating to the Old Testament'' (2nd ed., 1969).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor=James B[ennett] Pritchard|editor-link=James B. Pritchard|title=The Ancient Near East: Supplementary Texts and Pictures Relating to the Old Testament: Consisting of Supplementary Materials for The Ancient Near East in Pictures and Ancient Near Eastern Texts|edition=2nd|location=Princeton, N.J.|publisher=[[Princeton University Press]]|year=1969|pages=101, 305, 331, 338, 340, and 341|oclc=876082348}}&lt;/ref&gt; Colophons are also found in the [[Torah|Pentateuch]], where an understanding of this ancient literary convention illuminates passages that are otherwise unclear or incoherent. Examples are [[Book of Numbers|Numbers]] 3:1, where a later (and incorrect) chapter division makes this verse a heading for the following chapter instead of interpreting it properly as a colophon or summary for the preceding two chapters, and [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 37:2a, a colophon that concludes the histories (''[[toledot]]'') of [[Jacob]].

An extensive study of the eleven colophons found in the book of Genesis was done by Percy John Wiseman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=P[ercy] J[ohn] Wiseman|editor=D. J. Wiseman|title=Ancient Records and the Structure of Genesis: A Case for Literary Unity|location=Nashville, Tenn.|publisher=[[Thomas Nelson (publisher)|Thomas Nelson Publishers]]|year=1985|isbn=978-0-8407-7502-3}} The book was originally published as {{cite book|author=P[ercy] J[ohn] Wiseman|title=New Discoveries in Babylonia about Genesis|location=London; Edinburgh|publisher=[[Marshall Pickering|Marshall, Morgan &amp; Scott]]|year=1936|oclc=878558981}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wiseman's study of the Genesis colophons, sometimes described as the [[Wiseman hypothesis]], has a detailed examination of the catch phrases mentioned above that were used in literature of the second millennium B.C. and earlier in tying together the various accounts in a series of tablets.

In early printed books the colophon, when present, was a brief description of the printing and publication of the book, giving some or all of the following data: the date of publication, the place of publication or printing (sometimes including the address as well as the city name), the name(s) of the printer(s), and the name(s) of the publisher(s), if different. Sometimes additional information, such as the name of a proofreader or editor, or other more-or-less relevant details, might be added. A colophon might also be emblematic or pictorial rather than in words.&lt;ref name=OED/&gt; The normal position for a colophon was after the explicit (the end of the text, often after any index or register). After around 1500 these data were often transferred to the [[title page]], which sometimes existed in parallel with a colophon.

Colophons sometimes contained [[book curse]]s, as this was the one place in a medieval manuscript where a scribe was free to write what he wished. Such curses tend to be unique to each book.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Cynthia J. Cyrus|title=The Scribes for Women's Convents in Late Medieval Germany|url=https://books.google.com.sg/books?id=kKE97gvmWQcC&amp;pg=PA162|location=Toronto, Ont.|publisher=[[University of Toronto Press]]|year= 2009|page=162|isbn=978-1-4426-8908-4}}.

Goodspeed|title=The Curse in the Colophon|location=Chicago, Ill.|publisher=Willett, Clark, &amp; Company|year=1935|oclc=2599686}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Great Britain]] colophons grew generally less common in the 16th century. The statements of printing which appeared (under the terms of the Unlawful Societies Act 1799)&lt;ref&gt;Unlawful Societies Act 1799 ([[List of Acts of the Parliament of Great Britain, 1780–1800#39 Geo. 3|39 Geo. 3]], c.&amp;nbsp;79).&lt;/ref&gt; on the [[recto and verso|verso]] of the title-leaf and final page of each book printed in Britain in the 19th century are not, strictly speaking, colophons, and are better referred to as "printers' imprints" or "printer statements".

In some parts of the world, colophons helped fledgling printers and printing companies gain social recognition. For example, in early modern Armenia printers used colophons as a way to gain "prestige power" by getting their name out into the social sphere.&lt;ref&gt;Sebouh D. Aslanian. (2014). Port Cities and Printers: Reflections on Early Modern global Armenian Print Culture, ''Book History 17'', 60.&lt;/ref&gt; The use of colophons in early modern Armenian print culture is significant as well because it signalled the rate of decline in manuscript production and scriptoria use, and conversely the rise and perpetuation of printing for Armenians.

With the development of the [[private press movement]] from around 1890, colophons became conventional in private press books, and often included a good deal of additional information on the book, including statements of limitation, data on paper, ink, type and binding, and other technical details. Some such books include a separate "Note about the type", which will identify the names of the primary typefaces used, provide a brief description of the type's history and a brief statement about its most identifiable physical characteristics.

Some commercial publishers took up the use of colophons, and began to include similar details in their books, either at the end of the text (the traditional position) or on the verso of the title-leaf. Such colophons might identify the book's designer, the software used, the printing method, the printing company, the typeface(s) used in the page design and the kind of ink, paper and its cotton content.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, {{cite book|author=Stephen Wolfram|authorlink=Stephen Wolfram|title=A New Kind of Science|url=http://www.wolframscience.com/nksonline/page-1264|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140718051823/http://wolframscience.com/nksonline/page-1264?firstview=1|archivedate=18 July 2014|location=Champaign, Ill.|publisher=[[Wolfram Research|Wolfram Media]]|year=2002|page=1264|isbn=978-1-57955-008-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Book publishers [[Alfred A. Knopf]], the [[Folio Society]] and [[O'Reilly Media]] are notable for their substantial colophons.

'''Commercial law''', also known as '''trade law''', is the body of [[law]] that applies to the rights, relations, and conduct of [[Legal person|persons]] and businesses engaged in [[commerce]], [[merchandising]], [[trade]], and sales.&lt;ref name=cornellcommerciallaw&gt;{{cite web|title=Commercial Law: An Overview|url=http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/commercial_law|publisher=Legal Information Institute|accessdate=7 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is often considered to be a branch of [[Civil law (common law)|civil law]] and deals with issues of both [[private law]] and [[public law]].

Commercial law includes within its compass such titles as principal and agent; carriage by land and sea; [[Maritime transport|merchant shipping]]; [[guarantee]]; marine, fire, life, and accident [[insurance]]; bills of exchange, [[Negotiable instrument|negotiable instruments]], [[Contract|contracts]] and partnership.&lt;ref&gt;{{EB1911|wstitle=Commercial Law|volume=6|page=771|inline=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these categories fall within [[Financial law]], an aspected of Commercial law pertaining specifically to financing and the financial markets. It can also be understood to regulate [[corporation|corporate]] [[contract]]s, [[Recruitment|hiring practices]], and the [[manufacturing|manufacture]] and [[sales]] of [[Final good|consumer goods]]. Many countries have adopted [[civil code]]s that contain comprehensive statements of their commercial law.

In the United States, commercial law is the province of both the [[United States Congress]], under its power to regulate interstate commerce, and the states, under their police power. Efforts have been made to create a unified body of commercial law in the United States; the most successful of these attempts has resulted in the general [[Uniform Commercial Code adoption|adoption]] of the [[Uniform Commercial Code]], which has been adopted in all 50 states (with some modification by state legislatures), the [[Washington, D.C.|District of Columbia]], and the U.S. territories.

Various regulatory schemes control how commerce is conducted, particularly ''vis-a-vis'' employees and customers. Privacy laws, safety laws (e.g., the [[Occupational Safety and Health Act]] in the United States), and food and drug laws are some examples.

'''Constructivism''' was an [[art]]istic and [[architecture|architectural]] philosophy that originated in [[Russia]] beginning in 1913 by [[Vladimir Tatlin]]. This was a rejection of the idea of autonomous art. He wanted 'to construct' art. The movement was in favour of art as a practice for social purposes. Constructivism had a great effect on modern art movements of the 20th century, influencing major trends such as the [[Bauhaus]] and [[De Stijl]] movements. Its influence was widespread, with major effects upon architecture, [[sculpture]], [[graphic design]], [[industrial design]], theatre, film, dance, fashion and to some extent music.

==Beginnings==

The term ''Construction Art'' was first used as a derisive term by [[Kazimir Malevich]] to describe the work of [[Alexander Rodchenko]] in 1917.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}  Constructivism first appears as a positive term in [[Naum Gabo]]'s ''[[Realistic Manifesto]]'' of 1920. [[Aleksei Gan]] used the word as the title of his book ''Constructivism'', printed in 1922.&lt;ref&gt;Catherine Cooke, ''Russian Avant-Garde: Theories of Art, Architecture and the City'', Academy Editions, 1995, page 106.&lt;/ref&gt; Constructivism was a post-World War I development of [[Russian Futurism]], and particularly of the 'counter reliefs' of [[Vladimir Tatlin]], which had been exhibited in 1915. The term itself would be invented by the sculptors [[Antoine Pevsner]] and [[Naum Gabo]], who developed an industrial, angular style of work, while its geometric abstraction owed something to the [[Suprematism]] of Kazimir Malevich.

Constructivism as theory and practice was derived largely from a series of debates at the Institute of Artistic Culture ([[INKhUK]]) in Moscow, from 1920 to 1922. After deposing its first chairman, [[Wassily Kandinsky]], for his 'mysticism', The First Working Group of Constructivists (including [[Liubov Popova]], [[Alexander Vesnin]], [[Rodchenko]], [[Varvara Stepanova]], and the theorists [[Aleksei Gan]], [[Boris Arvatov]] and [[Osip Brik]]) would develop a definition of Constructivism as the combination of ''[[faktura]]'': the particular material properties of an object, and ''tektonika'', its spatial presence. Initially the Constructivists worked on three-dimensional constructions as a means of participating in industry: the OBMOKhU (Society of Young Artists) exhibition showed these three dimensional compositions, by Rodchenko, Stepanova, [[Karl Ioganson]] and the [[Stenberg brothers]]. Later the definition would be extended to designs for two-dimensional works such as books or posters, with ''montage'' and ''factography'' becoming important concepts.

==Art in the service of the Revolution==
[[Image:Plakat mayakowski gross.jpg|thumb|right|Agitprop poster by Mayakovsky]] 
As much as involving itself in designs for industry, the Constructivists worked on public festivals and street designs for the post-October revolution Bolshevik government. Perhaps the most famous of these was in [[Vitebsk]], where Malevich's [[UNOVIS]] Group painted propaganda plaques and buildings (the best known being [[El Lissitzky]]'s poster ''[[Beat the Whites with the Red Wedge]]'' (1919)). Inspired by [[Vladimir Mayakovsky]]'s declaration 'the streets our brushes, the squares our palettes', artists and designers participated in public life during the Civil War. A striking instance was the proposed festival for the [[Comintern]] congress in 1921 by Alexander Vesnin and Liubov Popova, which resembled the constructions of the OBMOKhU exhibition as well as their work for the theatre. There was a great deal of overlap during this period between Constructivism and [[Proletkult]], the ideas of which concerning the need to create an entirely new culture struck a chord with the Constructivists. In addition some Constructivists were heavily involved in the 'ROSTA Windows', a Bolshevik public information campaign of around 1920. Some of the most famous of these were by the poet-painter Vladimir Mayakovsky and Vladimir Lebedev.

The constructivists tried to create works that would make the viewer an active viewer of the artwork. In this it had similarities with the [[Russian Formalists]]' theory of 'making strange', and accordingly their main theorist [[Viktor Shklovsky]] worked closely with the Constructivists, as did other formalists like the Arch Bishop. These theories were tested in theatre, particularly with the work of [[Vsevolod Meyerhold]], who had established what he called 'October in the theatre'. Meyerhold developed a 'biomechanical' acting style, which was influenced both by the circus and by the 'scientific management' theories of [[Frederick Winslow Taylor]]. Meanwhile, the stage sets by the likes of Vesnin, Popova and Stepanova tested Constructivist spatial ideas in a public form. A more populist version of this was developed by [[Alexander Tairov]], with stage sets by [[Aleksandra Ekster]] and the Stenberg brothers. These ideas would influence German directors like [[Bertolt Brecht]] and [[Erwin Piscator]], as well as the early Soviet cinema.

==Tatlin, 'Construction Art' and Productivism==
The key work of Constructivism was Vladimir Tatlin's proposal for the [[Tatlin's Tower|Monument to the Third International]] (Tatlin's Tower) (1919–20)&lt;ref name=HF&gt;[[Hugh Honour|Honour, H.]] and Fleming, J. (2009) ''A World History of Art''. 7th edn. London: Laurence King Publishing, p. 819. {{ISBN|9781856695848}}&lt;/ref&gt; which combined a machine aesthetic with dynamic components celebrating technology such as searchlights and projection screens. Gabo publicly criticized Tatlin's design saying, "Either create functional houses and bridges or create pure art, not both."  This had already caused a major controversy in the Moscow group in 1920 when Gabo and Pevsner's ''[[Realistic Manifesto]]'' asserted a spiritual core for the movement. This was opposed to the utilitarian and adaptable version of Constructivism held by Tatlin and Rodchenko. Tatlin's work was immediately hailed by artists in Germany as a revolution in art: a 1920 photograph shows [[George Grosz]] and [[John Heartfield]] holding a placard saying 'Art is Dead – Long Live Tatlin's Machine Art', while the designs for the tower were published in [[Bruno Taut]]'s magazine ''Fruhlicht''. The tower was never built, however, due to a lack of money following the revolution.&lt;ref name=Janson&gt;[[H. W. Janson|Janson, H.W.]] (1995) ''History of Art''. 5th edn. Revised and expanded by Anthony F. Janson. London: [[Thames &amp; Hudson]], p. 820. {{ISBN|0500237018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tatlin's tower started a period of exchange of ideas between Moscow and Berlin, something reinforced by El Lissitzky and [[Ilya Ehrenburg]]'s Soviet-German magazine ''Veshch-Gegenstand-Objet'' which spread the idea of 'Construction art', as did the Constructivist exhibits at the 1922 ''Russische Ausstellung'' in Berlin, organised by Lissitzky. A [[Constructivist International]] was formed, which met with Dadaists and De Stijl artists in Germany in 1922. Participants in this short-lived international included Lissitzky, [[Hans Richter (artist)|Hans Richter]], and [[László Moholy-Nagy]]. However the idea of 'art' was becoming anathema to the Russian Constructivists: the INKhUK debates of 1920–22 had culminated in the theory of [[Productivism]] propounded by Osip Brik and others, which demanded direct participation in industry and the end of easel painting. Tatlin was one of the first to attempt to transfer his talents to industrial production, with his designs for an economical stove, for workers' overalls and for furniture. The Utopian element in Constructivism was maintained by his 'letatlin', a flying machine which he worked on until the 1930s.

==Constructivism and consumerism==
In 1921, the [[New Economic Policy]] was established in the Soviet Union, which opened up more market opportunities in the Soviet economy. Rodchenko, Stepanova, and others made advertising for the co-operatives that were now in competition with other commercial businesses. The poet-artist Vladimir Mayakovsky and Rodchenko worked together and called themselves "''advertising constructors''". Together they designed eye-catching images featuring bright colours, geometric shapes, and bold lettering.  The lettering of most of these designs was intended to create a reaction, and function emotionally – most were designed for the state-owned department store [[Mosselprom]] in Moscow, for pacifiers, cooking oil, beer and other quotidian products, with Mayakovsky claiming that his 'nowhere else but Mosselprom' verse was one of the best he ever wrote. 
Additionally, several artists tried to work with clothes design with varying success: Varvara Stepanova designed dresses with bright, geometric patterns that were mass-produced, although workers' overalls by Tatlin and Rodchenko never achieved this and remained prototypes. The painter and designer [[Lyubov Popova]] designed a kind of Constructivist [[flapper]] dress before her early death in 1924, the plans for which were published in the journal ''[[LEF (journal)|LEF]]''. In these works, Constructivists showed a willingness to involve themselves in fashion and the mass market, which they tried to balance with their Communist beliefs.

==LEF and Constructivist cinema==
[[Image:Aelita screenshot.jpg|thumb|240px|left|Constructivist Martian set in ''[[Aelita]]'' (1924)]]
The Soviet Constructivists organised themselves in the 1920s into the 'Left Front of the Arts',  who produced the influential journal ''LEF'', (which had two series, from 1923–5 and from 1927–9 as ''New LEF''). LEF was dedicated to maintaining the avant-garde against the critiques of the incipient [[Socialist Realism]], and the possibility of a capitalist restoration, with the journal being particularly scathing about the 'NEPmen', the capitalists of the period. For LEF the new medium of cinema was more important than the easel painting and traditional narratives that elements of the Communist Party were trying to revive then. Important Constructivists were very involved with cinema, with Mayakovsky acting in the film ''The Young Lady and the Hooligan'' (1919), Rodchenko's designs for the intertitles and animated sequences of [[Dziga Vertov]]'s ''Kino Eye'' (1924), and [[Aleksandra Ekster]] designs for the sets and costumes of the science fiction film ''[[Aelita]]'' (1924).

The Productivist theorists Osip Brik and [[Sergei Tretyakov (writer)|Sergei Tretyakov]] also wrote screenplays and intertitles, for films such as [[Vsevolod Pudovkin]]'s ''Storm over Asia'' (1928) or Victor Turin's ''Turksib'' (1929). The filmmakers and LEF contributors Dziga Vertov and [[Sergei Eisenstein]] as well as the documentarist [[Esfir Shub]] also regarded their fast-cut, montage style of filmmaking as Constructivist. The early [[Eccentrist]] movies of  [[Grigori Kozintsev]] and [[Leonid Trauberg]] (''[[The New Babylon]]'', ''[[Alone (1931 film)|Alone]]'') had similarly avant-garde intentions, as well as a fixation on jazz-age America which was characteristic of the philosophy, with its praise of slapstick-comedy actors like [[Charlie Chaplin]] and [[Buster Keaton]], as well as of [[Fordist]] mass production. Like the photomontages and designs of Constructivism, early [[Soviet film|Soviet cinema]] concentrated on creating an agitational effect by montage and 'making strange'.

==Photography and photomontage==
The Constructivists were early developers of the techniques of [[photomontage]]. Gustav Klutsis' 'Dynamic City' and 'Lenin and Electrification' (1919–20) are the first examples of this method of montage, which had in common with [[Dadaism]] the collaging together of news photographs and painted sections. However Constructivist montages would be less 'destructive' than those of Dadaism. Perhaps the most famous of these montages was Rodchenko's illustrations of the Mayakovsky poem ''About This''.

LEF also helped popularise a distinctive style of photography, involving jagged angles and contrasts and an abstract use of light, which paralleled the work of [[László Moholy-Nagy]] in Germany: the major practitioners of this included, along with Rodchenko, [[Boris Ignatovich]] and [[Max Penson]], among others. This also shared many characteristics with the early documentary movement.

==Constructivist graphic design==
[[File:'Proun Vrashchenia' by El Lissitzky, ca. 1919.jpg|thumb|'Proun Vrashchenia' by [[El Lissitzky]], 1919]]
The book designs of Rodchenko, El Lissitzky and others such as [[Solomon Telingater]] and [[Anton Lavinsky]] were a major inspiration for the work of radical designers in the West, particularly [[Jan Tschichold]]. Many Constructivists worked on the design of posters for everything from cinema to political propaganda: the former represented best by the brightly coloured, geometric posters of the Stenberg brothers (Georgii and Vladimir Stenberg), and the latter by the agitational photomontage work of [[Gustav Klutsis]] and [[Valentina Kulagina]].

In [[Cologne]] in the late 1920s [[Figurative Constructivism]] emerged from the [[Cologne Progressives]], a group which had links with Russian Constructivists, particularly Lissitzky, since the early twenties. Through their collaboration with [[Otto Neurath]] and the [[Gesellschafts- und Wirtschaftsmuseum]] such artists as [[Gerd Antz]], [[Augustin Tschinkel]] and [[Peter Alma]] they affected the development of the [[Isotype (picture language)|Vienna Method]]. This link was most clearly shown in ''A bis Z'' a journal published by [[Franz Seiwert]] the principal theorist of the group.&lt;ref&gt;Benus B. (2013) 'Figurative Constructivism and sociological graphics' in ''Isotype: Design and Contexts 1925-71'' London: Hyphen Press, pp.216-248&lt;/ref&gt; They were active in Russia working with [[IZOSTAT]] and Tschinkel worked with [[Ladislav Sutnar ]] before he emigrated to the US.

The Constructivists' main early political patron was [[Leon Trotsky]], and it began to be regarded with suspicion after the expulsion of Trotsky and the Left Opposition in 1927-8. The [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Communist Party]] would gradually favour realist art during the course of the 1920s (as early as 1918 ''[[Pravda]]'' had complained that government funds were being used to buy works by untried artists). However it was not until about 1934 that the counter-doctrine of [[Socialist Realism]] was instituted in Constructivism's place. Many Constructivists continued to produce avantgarde work in the service of the state, such as Lissitzky, Rodchenko and Stepanova's designs for the magazine ''[[USSR In Construction]]''.

==Constructivist architecture==
{{main|Constructivist architecture}}

Constructivist architecture emerged from the wider constructivist art movement. After the [[Russian Revolution of 1917]] it turned its attentions to the new social demands and industrial tasks required of the new regime. Two distinct threads emerged, the first was encapsulated in Antoine Pevsner's and Naum Gabo's ''[[Realist manifesto]]'' which was concerned with space and rhythm, the second represented a struggle within the [[Narkompros|Commissariat for Enlightenment]] between those who argued for ''pure art'' and the [[Productivism (art)|Productivists]] such as Alexander Rodchenko, Varvara Stepanova and Vladimir Tatlin, a more socially oriented group who wanted this art to be absorbed in industrial production.&lt;ref name="thought"&gt;{{Cite book| last = Oliver Stallybrass | first = and Alan Bullock (et al.) | title = The Fontana Dictionary of Modern Thought | year = 1988 | type = Paperback | publisher = Fontana press | isbn = 0-00-686129-6 | page = 918 pages}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A split occurred in 1922 when Pevsner and Gabo emigrated. The movement then developed along socially [[utilitarian]] lines. The productivist majority gained the support of the [[Proletkult]] and the magazine LEF, and later became the dominant influence of the architectural group [[OSA Group|O.S.A.]], directed by [[Alexander Vesnin]] and [[Moisei Ginzburg]].

==Legacy==
A number of Constructivists would teach or lecture at the [[Bauhaus]] schools in Germany, and some of the VKhUTEMAS teaching methods were adopted and developed there. Gabo established a version of Constructivism in England during the 1930s and 1940s that was adopted by architects, designers and artists after World War I (see [[Victor Pasmore]]), and [[John McHale (artist)|John McHale]].  [[Joaquín Torres García]] and [[Manuel Rendón]] were instrumental in spreading Constructivism throughout Europe and Latin America.  Constructivism had an effect on the modern masters of Latin America such as: [[Carlos Mérida]], [[Enrique Tábara]], [[Aníbal Villacís]], [[Theo Constanté]], [[Oswaldo Viteri]],  [[Estuardo Maldonado]], [[Luis Molinari]], [[Carlos Catasse]], [[João Batista Vilanova Artigas]] and [[Oscar Niemeyer]], to name just a few. There have also been disciples in Australia, the painter [[George Johnson (artist)|George Johnson]] being the best known.

In the 1980s graphic designer [[Neville Brody]] used styles based on Constructivist posters that initiated a revival of popular interest. Also during the 1980s designer Ian Anderson founded [[The Designers Republic]], a successful and influential design company which used constructivist principles.

So-called [[Deconstructivism|Deconstructivist]] architecture was developed by architects [[Zaha Hadid]], [[Rem Koolhaas]] and others during the late 20th and early 21st centuries. Zaha Hadid by her sketches and drawings of abstract triangles and rectangles evokes the aesthetic of constructivism. Though similar formally, the socialist political connotations of Russian constructivism are deemphasized by Hadid's deconstructivism. Rem Koolhaas' projects revive another aspect of constructivism. The [[scaffold]] and [[Crane (machine)|crane]]-like structures represented by many constructivist architects are used for the finished forms of his designs and buildings.

'''Cramond''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|r|æ|m|ən|d}}; {{lang-gd|Cathair Amain}}) is a village and suburb in the north-west of [[Edinburgh]], Scotland, at the mouth of the [[River Almond, Lothian|River Almond]] where it enters the [[Firth of Forth]].

The Cramond area has a long history, with evidence of [[Mesolithic]], [[Bronze Age]] and [[Roman Scotland|Roman]] activity. In modern times, it was the birthplace of the Scottish economist [[John Law (economist)|John Law]] (1671–1729). Cramond was incorporated into the City of Edinburgh by Act of Parliament in 1920.

==Etymology==

It was once believed that [[Cramond Roman Fort]] was known to the Romans as ''Alaterva''. A stone altar was dug up in the grounds of Cramond House dedicated "To the Alatervan [[Matres and Matrones|Mothers]] and the Mothers of the Parade-ground."&lt;ref name="rcahms"&gt;[http://canmore.rcahms.gov.uk/en/site/50409/details/cramond/ Site Record for Cramond Edinburgh, Cramond Roman Fort Details] - Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Scotland&lt;/ref&gt; Early [[antiquarian]]s interpreted the inscription as referring to the place where the stone was found, but this idea is no longer accepted among scholars, and "Alatervae" is presumably a native name for the [[Matres and Matrones|Matronae]], perhaps originating with the [[Tungri]]an cohort who erected the altar.&lt;ref&gt;"The ''Matres Alatervae'' (or ''Alatervia''), on the other hand, are mentioned only here, and the significance of the epithet they bear is wholly obscure. Sir John Clerk, in a letter which is printed by Gordon, suggested that it was local and that ''Alaterva'' was the Roman name of Cramond. Endorsed by [[William Stukeley|Stukeley]], this suggestion has been generally accepted. But it has no foundation in fact. It is much more probable that the Tungrians had brought the designation with them from their native land, and that it is there that Alaterva must be looked for, if indeed it be a place at all." ''Tenth report with inventory of monuments and constructions in the counties of Midlothian and West Lothian'', (1929), page 42. Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments and Constructions of Scotland&lt;/ref&gt;

In the centuries that followed the end of the Roman occupation, Cramond passed into the hands of the [[Votadini]], who spoke [[Cumbric language|Cumbric]], a [[Brythonic languages|Brythonic]] [[Celtic languages|Celtic language]], and gave the settlement its name. Cramond is derived from the compound ''Caer Amon'', meaning 'fort on the river', referring to the Roman fort that lay on the River Almond.&lt;ref&gt;Bethany Fox, 'The P-Celtic Place-Names of North-East England and South-East Scotland', The Heroic Age, 10 (2007), http://www.heroicage.org/issues/10/fox.html (appendix at http://www.heroicage.org/issues/10/fox-appendix.html).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early history===

==== Pre-Roman ====

Archaeological excavations at Cramond have uncovered evidence of habitation dating to around [[9th millennium BC|8500 BC]], making it, for a time, the earliest known site of human settlement in Scotland.&lt;ref name="Nuts give clue to 'oldest' Scots site"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/1352091.stm| title=Nuts give clue to 'oldest' Scots site| author= BBC News| accessdate=2008-06-28 | date=2001-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The inhabitants of the Mesolithic camp-site were nomadic hunter-gatherers who moved around their territories according to the season of the year.&lt;ref name="hunter-gatherers"&gt;Cramond Heritage Trust (1996), p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; Although no bones survived the acid soil, waste pits and stakeholes that would have supported shelters or windbreaks were excavated. Numerous discarded hazelnut shells, the waste product of the inhabitants' staple food, were found in the pits and used to carbon-date the site.&lt;ref name="hunter-gatherers"/&gt; It is thought the site was chosen for its location near the junction of the Firth of Forth and the River Almond, where the rich oyster and mussel beds proved a reliable natural resource.  Many [[microlith]] stone tools manufactured at the site were found, and pre-date finds of similar style in England.&lt;ref name="Earliest evidence found of settlers in Scotland"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.britarch.ac.uk/BA/ba60/news.shtml| title=Earliest evidence found of settlers in Scotland| author= British Archaeology| accessdate=2008-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Roman period====
{{See also|Cramond Roman Fort}}
Around 142, [[Roman Empire|Roman]] forces arrived at Cramond by order of Emperor [[Antoninus Pius]], who had given them the task of establishing a [[fort]] at the mouth of the River Almond. This fort would guard the eastern flank of the frontier that the Romans had established across Scotland. Nearly five hundred men worked on the site, building a fort that covered nearly six acres and a harbour for communication. However, the fort was only inhabited for a short time, perhaps fifteen years, before it was abandoned by the troops who were ordered to retreat south to [[Hadrian's Wall]]. Pottery and coins of later date indicate that the fort and harbour were reinhabited and used as a base for the army and navy of the Emperor [[Septimius Severus]], sometime between 208 and 211.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Elliott|first1=Simon|last2=Hughes|first2=Tristan|title=The Scottish Campaigns of Septimius Severus|url=http://turningpointsoftheancientworld.com/index.php/2018/03/18/scottish-campaigns-septimius-severus/|accessdate=21 May 2018|agency=Turning Points Of The Ancient World|date=18 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The medieval parish church of Cramond parish (which retains its late medieval western tower in altered form), was built within the Roman fort.

[[File:Cramond Lioness, National Museum of Scotland.jpg|thumb|160px|Cramond Lioness]]
Though knowledge of the Roman presence at Cramond was recorded afterwards, the remains of the fort itself were only rediscovered in 1954. Substantial archaeological research was carried out upon its discovery to build up a reasonably accurate picture of the site in Roman times. The fort was rectangular in shape, with walls fifteen feet high on all sides. A [[gatehouse]] was set in every wall, allowing access in all four directions. Inside, there were barracks, workshops, granaries, headquarters and the commander's house. Later excavations revealed other constructions outside the boundary of the fort, including a [[Thermae|bath-house]], further industrial workshops and a native settlement.

In 1997 the ''[[Cramond Lioness]]'' was uncovered in the harbour mud by a local boatman (who received a substantial monetary reward for finding this major antiquity), and was identified as a sandstone statue of a lioness devouring a hapless male figure, probably one of a pair at the tomb of a military commander. After conservation, the statue was displayed in the [[Museum of Scotland]] in Edinburgh.  It is one of the most ambitious pieces of Roman sculpture to have survived in Scotland.

==== Medieval period ====
[[File:Cramond map.jpg|thumb|200px|A map showing the parish of Cramond in 1794.]]

After the departure of the Romans, little is known about the state of Cramond for several centuries. The historiography of the period is perhaps best summed up by the historian J. Wood, who wrote 'a dark cloud of obscurity again settled over the parish of Cramond, of which I cannot find the smallest memorial in any historian till the year 995.'&lt;ref name="dark cloud of obscurity"&gt;Wood (1794), p. 12&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[tower house]], [[Cramond Tower]], probably built in the early 15th century, and part of a now-demolished larger establishment, was once a manor house of the [[Bishop of Dunkeld|Bishops of Dunkeld]], of whose diocese Cramond was a part.  It was made structurally sound and converted to a private dwelling in the 1980s.

===Modern history===

[[File:The Long Walk - geograph.org.uk - 38912.jpg|thumb|300px|View of Cramond Causeway looking towards Cramond]]

Cramond developed slowly over the centuries, with Cramond Kirk being founded in 1656. After a brief period spent as an industrial village in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, by the late 19th century it became a desirable suburb of Edinburgh, which it remains to this day.

==Geography==

Cramond is located at {{coord|55|58.78|N|3|18.04|W|region:GB_type:city(7500)|display=inline,title}} in northwest Edinburgh, about {{convert|5|mi|km}} from the city centre, at the mouth of the River Almond where it enters the Firth of Forth.

Historically, the parish of Cramond extended from the shore of the Firth of Forth in the north to the parish of [[Corstorphine]] in the south, and was bounded on the west by the parishes of [[Dalmeny]] and [[Kirkliston]] and on the east by the parish of St Cuthbert's.&lt;ref name="geography"&gt;Wood (1794), p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; It covered an area of fifteen square miles, and encompassed the villages of [[Granton, Edinburgh|Granton]], [[Pilton, Edinburgh|Pilton]], [[Muirhouse]], [[Davidson's Mains]], [[Blackhall, Edinburgh|Blackhall]], [[Ravelston]], [[Craigcrook]], [[Turnhouse]] and [[Craigiehall]].&lt;ref name="parish boundaries"&gt;Brown (2000), p. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

The area has a low, gently undulating [[topography]] that drops down from the top of Corstorphine hill to the shore in three gradual stages and is intersected by the River Almond which flows northward into the Forth.&lt;ref name="topography"&gt;Cramond Heritage Trust (1996), p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; During the last ice age the area was heavily glaciated, and the main direction of the ice flow was west to east. Consequently, there are rock deposits on the east side of landforms such as the Almond river valley, and until the Cramond promenade was built in the 1930s large glacial boulders were strewn along the shore.&lt;ref name="topography"/&gt; The [[geology]] of Cramond consists of [[calciferous sandstone]], which mixed with two later [[Sill (geology)|sills]] to give the area its characteristic chocolate-brown soil.&lt;ref name="topography"/&gt;

The leaflet “Geological history of cramond” provides information about the geology of the cramond area such as that there is a coal seam visible near the beach on the south west side of the river almond estuary.&lt;ref&gt; “Geological history of cramond Edinburgh …  copyright 2014 lothian and borders geoconservation, a committee of the edinburgh geological society, a charity registered in scotland. Charity no: sc008011. The cramond heritage trust is a charity registered in scotland. Charity no: sc000754”
&lt;/ref&gt;


==Landmarks and sculpture==
The 8 tonne work ''Fish'' has been permanently installed on the Waterfront at Cramond in 2009&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.scotsman.com/edinburgh/Neighbours-chip-in-to-net.5098132.jp | location=Edinburgh | work=The Scotsman | first=Hazel | last=Mollison | title=Neighbours chip in to net fish sculpture | date=2009-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; after a successful campaign by the Cramond community, paying homage to the eight months of carving of the pink granite there by [[sculptor]] [[Ronald Rae]] in 2002.

Cramond Kirk Church Hall also displays the smaller ''Cramond Fish''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ronaldrae.co.uk/pages/selectedartwork.php?artworkid=46&amp;slideshowcode=UNAVAIL |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-05-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071103205935/http://www.ronaldrae.co.uk/pages/selectedartwork.php?artworkid=46&amp;slideshowcode=UNAVAIL |archivedate=2007-11-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the car park, to the rear of the Kirk Hall, another sculpture (elephant) is taking shape.

==Architecture==

The older houses along the wharf are typical of traditional south-east Scottish [[vernacular architecture]], constructed in stone with [[harl]]ing white [[lime render]] finish, with facing stone window and door surrounds and ''crow-step gables'', roofed with orangey-red clay pantiles imported from the Netherlands. A ruined water mill lies further up the Almond along a quiet walk past a yacht club and sailing boats moored in the river. To the east a sand beach and waterfront esplanade provides a popular walk to Silverknowes and Granton. On the other side of the Almond, (once accessible by a rowing-boat ferry) the [[Dalmeny House|Dalmeny Estate]] has a pleasant walk through Dalmeny Woods along the shore of the Firth of Forth.

Near the kirk stands the imposing Cramond House. Its central part is late 17th century, with classical front added in 1778 and back in 1820. [[Queen Victoria]] visited while residing at [[The Palace of Holyroodhouse|Holyrood]]. It has been claimed as a possible original of [[R. L. Stevenson]]’s "House of Shaws" in ''[[Kidnapped (novel)|Kidnapped]]''. It is now owned by Trustees of the Church of Scotland and until 2010 was used as the headquarters of the [[Scottish Wildlife Trust]].  The Trust relocated to Leith. The Manse dates originally from the mid-17th century and was rebuilt in the mid-18th century. The north wing was added about 1770 and a south wing in 1857. Reverend Walker, the skating minister in [[Raeburn]]'s famous portrait, lived here from 1776 to 1784.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cramondassociation.org.uk/historic_map.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Offshore, [[Cramond Island]] has [[World War II|WW II]] fortifications and is linked to land by a [[causeway]] with a line of concrete pylons on one side, constructed as an anti shipping barrier.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.scotlandsplaces.gov.uk/record/rcahms/113097/edinburgh-cramond-island-anti-shipping-barrier/rcahms|title=Edinburgh, Cramond Island, Anti-shipping Barrier {{!}} ScotlandsPlaces|website=www.scotlandsplaces.gov.uk|access-date=2017-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; At certain low tides sand extends to the island, tempting visitors to visit the island, though occasionally some are stranded by the incoming tide.

== Cramond in fiction ==
For many people Cramond is associated with ''[[The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie (film)|The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie]]'', where Mr. Lowther has his home and Miss Brodie spends much of her time. Cramond is also where the House of Shaws is located in [[Robert Louis Stevenson]]'s ''[[Kidnapped (novel)|Kidnapped]]''.
Cramond is also mentioned in [[Ian Rankin]]'s ''[[Fleshmarket Close]]''.

Cramond features briefly in a series 2 episode of the ''[[Paul Temple (TV series)]]'' called 'Double Vision' filmed in 1970. More recently Cramond featured in ''[[Young Sherlock Holmes: Fire Storm]]''.

The '''Dupplin Cross''' is a carved, monumental [[Pictish stone]], which dates from around 800 A.D. It was first recorded by [[Thomas Pennant]] in 1769, on a hillside in [[Strathearn]], a little to the north (and on the opposite bank of the river [[Earn River|Earn]] from) [[Forteviot]] and [[Dunning]]. In 2002 it was placed in the care of [[Historic Scotland]], and was placed for preservation under the 11th/12th century tower of [[St Serf]]'s church in Dunning (also in the care of Historic Scotland).  Open to the public April-September.

The Dupplin Cross is a [[high cross]], that is a free-standing stone cross. While relatively common in [[Ireland]], [[Northumbria]] and in [[Dál Riata]], such crosses are rare survivals in the lands of the [[Picts]], though fragments of shattered crosses (probably cast down during the 16th century [[Reformation]]) show that a number once existed. Early records report that a second cross, 'Cross of Dronachy', stood on the lands of Invermay, south of Forteviot and also overlooking Forteviot, but this is now lost.  The cross base survives ''in situ'', but the records do not provide details of its exact form.

The cross is carved from [[Old Red Sandstone]], the cross stands about 2.5 metres tall, 1 metre broad over the arms of the cross. It is carved with various scenes, religious, martial and traditional Pictish animal carvings. The cross contains a partially legible inscription, of which only the name ''CUSTANTIN FILIUS FIRCUS'' can be read. This name is taken as the [[Latin]] form of the early 9th century Pictish king's Gaelic name [[Caustantín of the Picts|Caustantín]] son of Fergus ([[floruit|fl.]] 793&amp;ndash;820).

Since the inscription implies that the Cross was carved either during, or shortly after, the reign of Caustantín, it is particularly important as giving a fixed point in the chronology of Pictish sculpture. It also indicates that Gaelic was spoken at the time as it uses the Gaelic personal name of his father in Latin.
[[File:The Rider, Dupplin Cross.jpg|thumb|left|The Rider, Dupplin Cross]]

Other carved themes on the cross include a rider with an oversized head and ponytail showing him to be a man of authority. On the obverse a man fights bears with his bare hands. The sides include a man (probably David) playing a harp, and hunting dogs.

{{hatnote|Not to be confused with dates [[anno Mundi]],  abbreviated 'AM'.}}
The '''Era of the Martyrs''' ({{lang-la|anno martyrum}}), also known as the '''Diocletian era''' ({{lang-la|anno Diocletiani}}), is a method of numbering years used by the [[Church of Alexandria]] beginning in the 4th century{{nbsp}}AD and by the [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria]] from the 5th century to the present. Western Christians were aware of it but did not use it. It was named for the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] Emperor [[Diocletian]] who instigated the [[Diocletianic Persecution|last major persecution against Christians]] in the Empire. Diocletian began his reign 20 November 284 during the [[Byzantine_calendar#Alexandrian_Era|Alexandrian year]] that began on 1 Thoth, the Egyptian New Year, or 29 August 284, so that date was used as the [[epoch (reference date)|epoch]]: year one of the Diocletian era began on that date. This era was used to number the year in [[Paschal_Full_Moon|Easter tables]] produced by the Church of Alexandria. 

When [[Dionysius Exiguus]] continued those tables for an additional 95 years, he replaced the anno Diocletiani era with his [[anno Domini]] era because he did not wish to continue the memory of a tyrant who persecuted Christians.&lt;ref&gt;Blackburn &amp; Holford-Strevens 2003, 767&lt;/ref&gt; The anno Domini era became dominant in the Latin West but was not used in the Greek East until modern times. 

The anno Diocletiani era was not the only one used by early Christians. Most Roman Christians, like the pagan Romans before them, designated their years by naming the two [[consul]]s who held office that year. The Romans also used the [[ab urbe condita]] (AUC) era. Its name is Latin for "from the founding of the City (Rome)." However, the AUC era was hardly ever used outside historical treatises.

Eras that began at Creation, called [[anno Mundi]] eras, became the dominant method of numbering years in the East until modern times, such as in the [[Byzantine calendar]]. [[Annianus of Alexandria]], a monk who flourished at the beginning of the 5th century, placed the epoch of his world era on 25 March 5492{{nbsp}}BC by counting back eleven 532-year [[paschal cycle]]s from anno Diocletiani 77, itself four 19-year [[lunar cycle]]s after anno Diocletiani 1. Regarded as a civil rather than a religious era, it began on the first day of the Alexandrian year, 29 August 5493{{nbsp}}BC. This Alexandrian era was the preferred era used by [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] Christians such as [[Maximus the Confessor]] until the Byzantine era, having an epoch of 1 September 5509{{nbsp}}BC, became dominant in the 10th century. Both eras used a version of [[dating Creation]] based on the [[Septuagint]].

{{Education in the U.S.}}
Education, once solely a state and local issue, now sees significant amounts of oversight and funding on the elementary and secondary levels from the federal government.&lt;ref name="library.cqpress.com"&gt;[http://library.cqpress.com/catn/document.php?id=catn69-6-3693-190033&amp;type=query&amp;num=education+programs&amp;  Education Programs, 1945-1972 Legislative Overview]&lt;/ref&gt;  This trend started slowly in the Civil War era, but increased precipitously during and following World War II, and has continued to the present day.&lt;ref name="The Federal Role in Education"&gt;[http://www2.ed.gov/about/overview/fed/role.html The Federal Role in Education]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Initial federal action==
The first piece of federal education legislation passed by Congress was the [[Morrill Land-Grant Colleges Act]].  This bill was passed as a means for the Federal government to provide land proportional to the number of Congressmen and Senators a state had for states to use to create agricultural colleges.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.loc.gov/rr/program/bib/ourdocs/Morrill.html  Library of Congress: Morrill Act]&lt;/ref&gt;   The next noteworthy piece of legislation passed by Congress pertaining to education was the [[Smith-Hughes Act]] which provided federal aid to vocational education programs across the country.  Through the beginning of the 20th century, the federal government had a relatively small role to play in education, and its contributions focused mainly on providing opportunities to students who would later become an important part of a well-functioning economy.  This tact changed following the Great Depression and World War II though.

==Post-World War II era==
The federal government’s foray into public education had two main motivations, National defense and social responsibility. While they do not entirely overlap chronologically, they together served as a way for the federal government to become involved.

===National defense===
After the end of World War II, US soldiers fighting abroad came home and, in an attempt to offset the influx of servicemen returning to the workforce, Congress passed the [[Servicemen’s Readjustment Act]]. Congress did not pass another piece of war-related education legislation until the [[National Defense Education Act]]. A direct response to the Soviet launch of sputnik, the act provided federal funding towards math, science and language programs to help American students catch up to the Soviets.&lt;ref&gt;Urban, Wayne J., and Jennings L. Wagoner, Jr. American Education: A History. 4th. New York, NY: Routledge, 2009. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;  By turning education into a matter of national defense, the federal government gave itself a valid reason for having a say in education policy, as there is no mention of education in the U.S. Constitution, and therefore it is a power reserved to the people or the states.

===Social responsibility===
During and immediately after the war, the federal government contributed money to districts unduly burdened by military instillations.&lt;ref name="The Federal Role in Education"/&gt;  During this time, some began to believe that schools could no longer adequately provide for themselves.&lt;ref name="library.cqpress.com"/&gt;  The [[Brown v. Board]] ruling aided this viewpoint in that the federal government had to get involved in making sure that all individuals were protected.&lt;ref&gt;Horn Jr., Raymond A. Understanding Educational Reform. Santa Barbara, CA: ABC-CLIO, 2002. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;  This, along with the “urban crisis” happening in the US, led the federal government to pass one of its most long lasting and impactful pieces of education legislation, the [[Elementary and Secondary Education Act]].&lt;ref&gt;Ravitch, Diane. The Troubled Crusade: American Education, 1945-1980. New York, NY: Basic Books Inc., 1983. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;  A general subsidy for education with a series of provisions states must follow, the ESEA thrust the Federal government into the education policy picture.

{{Prerogative writs}}
'''''Habeas corpus''''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|h|eɪ|b|i|ə|s|_|ˈ|k|ɔr|p|ə|s}}; [[Medieval Latin]] meaning literally "that you have the body")&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=habeas corpus|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/habeas%20corpus|website=Merriam-Webster|accessdate=22 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[Legal recourse|recourse in law]] through which a person can report an [[Arbitrary arrest and detention|unlawful detention or imprisonment]] to a [[court]] and request that the court order the custodian of the person, usually a prison official, to bring the prisoner to court, to determine whether the detention is lawful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Larson|first1=Aaron|title=What is Habeas Corpus|url=https://www.expertlaw.com/library/criminal/habeas_corpus.html|website=ExpertLaw|accessdate=1 May 2017|language=English|date=24 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The writ of ''habeas corpus'' is known as "the great and efficacious writ in all manner of illegal confinement".&lt;ref group="Note"&gt;per Blackstone&lt;/ref&gt; It is a summons with the force of a [[court order]]; it is addressed to the custodian (a prison official, for example) and demands that a prisoner be taken before the court, and that the custodian present proof of authority, allowing the court to determine whether the custodian has lawful authority to detain the prisoner. If the custodian is acting beyond his or her authority, then the prisoner must be released. Any prisoner, or another person acting on his or her behalf, may petition the court, or a judge, for a writ of ''habeas corpus''. One reason for the writ to be sought by a person other than the prisoner is that the detainee might be held [[Solitary confinement|incommunicado]]. Most [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] jurisdictions provide a similar remedy for those unlawfully detained, but this is not always called ''habeas corpus''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Introduction to the Study of the Law of the Constitution|first=Albert|last=Venn Dicey|url=https://books.google.com/?id=kz40AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PR3&amp;dq=INTRODUCTION+TO+THE+STUDY+OF+THE+LAW+OF+THE+CONSTITUTION+A.+V.+Dicey|year=1908}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in some Spanish-speaking nations, the equivalent remedy for unlawful imprisonment is the ''[[amparo de libertad]]'' ("protection of freedom").

''Habeas corpus'' has certain limitations. Though a writ of right, it is not a writ of course.&lt;ref group="Note"&gt;The applicant must make out a ''prima facie'' case. However, once that is done, the applicant is entitled to the writ as of right, which is then granted ''ex debito justitae'' ("from a debt of justice", that is, as a matter of right)&lt;/ref&gt; It is technically only a procedural [[legal remedy|remedy]]; it is a guarantee against any detention that is forbidden by law, but it does not necessarily protect other rights, such as the entitlement to a fair trial. So if an imposition such as internment without trial is permitted by the law, then ''habeas corpus'' may not be a useful remedy. In some countries, the writ has been temporarily or permanently suspended under the pretext of war or [[state of emergency]].{{elucidate|date=February 2016}}

The right to petition for a writ of ''habeas corpus'' has nonetheless long been celebrated as the most efficient safeguard of the liberty of the subject. The jurist [[Albert Venn Dicey]] wrote that the British [[Habeas Corpus Act 1679|Habeas Corpus Acts]] "declare no principle and define no rights, but they are for practical purposes worth a hundred constitutional articles guaranteeing individual liberty".&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Wright (1994) [https://books.google.com/books?id=I7oOAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA16&amp;dq=declare+no+principle+and+define+no+rights,+but+they+are+for+practical+purposes+worth+a+hundred+constitutional+articles+guaranteeing+individual+liberty&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=10#v=onepage&amp;q=declare%20no%20principle%20and%20define%20no%20rights%2C%20but%20they%20are%20for%20practical%20purposes%20worth%20a%20hundred%20constitutional%20articles%20guaranteeing%20individual%20liberty ''Citizens and subjects: an essay on British politics''], Routledge, 1994&lt;/ref&gt;

The writ of ''habeas corpus'' is one of what are called the "extraordinary", "[[common law]]", or "[[prerogative writ]]s", which were historically issued by the [[English courts]] in the name of the monarch to control inferior courts and public authorities within the kingdom. The most common of the other such prerogative writs are ''[[quo warranto]]'', ''[[prohibito]]'', ''[[mandamus]]'', ''[[procedendo]]'', and ''[[certiorari]]''. The due process for such petitions is not simply civil or criminal, because they incorporate the presumption of non-authority. The official who is the respondent must prove his authority to do or not do something. Failing this, the court must decide for the petitioner, who may be any person, not just an interested party. This differs from a motion in a civil process in which the movant must have standing, and bears the burden of proof.

==Etymology==
From Latin ''habeas'', 2nd person singular present [[subjunctive mood|subjunctive]] active of ''habere'', "to have", "to hold"; and ''corpus'', accusative singular of ''corpus'', "body". In reference to more than one person, ''habeas corpora''.

Literally, the phrase means "[we command] that you should have the [detainee's] body [brought to court]". The complete phrase ''habeas corpus ad subjiciendum'' means "that you have the person for the purpose of subjecting him/her to (examination)". These are the opening words of writs in 14th century Anglo-French documents requiring a person to be brought before a court or judge, especially to determine if that person is being legally detained.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=habeas corpus |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=habeas%20corpus |website=Online Etymology Dictionary |accessdate=17 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Similarly named writs===
The full name of the writ is often used to distinguish it from similar ancient writs, also named ''habeas corpus''. These include:
* ''Habeas corpus ad deliberandum et recipiendum'': a writ for bringing an accused from a different county into a court in the place where a crime had been committed for purposes of trial, or more literally to return holding the body for purposes of "deliberation and receipt" of a decision. ("[[Extradition]]")
* ''Habeas corpus ad faciendum et recipiendum'' (also called ''habeas corpus cum causa''): a writ of a superior court to a custodian to return with the body being held by the order of a lower court "with reasons", for the purpose of "receiving" the decision of the superior court and of "doing" what it ordered.
* ''Habeas corpus ad prosequendum'': a writ ordering return with a prisoner for the purpose of "prosecuting" him before the court.
* ''Habeas corpus ad respondendum'': a writ ordering return to allow the prisoner to "answer" to new proceedings before the court.
* ''Habeas corpus ad testificandum'': a writ ordering return with the body of a prisoner for the purposes of "testifying".

==Origins in England==
{{further|English law}}
''Habeas corpus'' originally stems from the [[Assize of Clarendon]], a re-issuance of rights during the reign of [[Henry II of England]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://avalon.law.yale.edu/medieval/assizecl.asp |title=Assize of Clarendon, 1166. |date=1 December 1998 |publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 17th century, the foundations for ''habeas corpus'' were "wrongly thought" to have originated in [[Magna Carta]].&lt;ref&gt;Turner, Ralph V. ''Magna Carta'' Pearson (2003) p162 and p219&lt;/ref&gt; This charter declared that:{{quote|No [[Estates of the realm|Freeman]] shall be taken or imprisoned, or be disseized of his [[Freehold (law)|Freehold]], or Liberties, or free Customs, or be outlawed, or exiled, or any other wise destroyed; nor will We not pass upon him, nor condemn him, but by lawful judgment of his Peers, or by the Law of the land.}}

[[William Blackstone]] cites the first recorded usage of ''habeas corpus ad subjiciendum'' in 1305, during the reign of [[Edward I of England|King Edward&amp;nbsp;I]]. However, other [[writ]]s were issued with the same effect as early as the reign of [[Henry II of England|Henry&amp;nbsp;II]] in the 12th century. Blackstone explained the basis of the writ, saying "[t]he king is at all times entitled to have an account, why the liberty of any of his subjects is restrained, wherever that restraint may be inflicted."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Blackstone |first1=William |title=Commentaries on the Laws of England: A Facsimile of the First Edition of 1765-1769, vol. 3, pp. 129-37 |date=1768 |publisher=University of Chicago Press (1979), reproduced in ''The Founders' Constitution,'' Volume 3, Article 1, Section 9, Clause 2, Document 4 |location=Chicago |url=http://press-pubs.uchicago.edu/founders/documents/a1_9_2s4.html |accessdate=6 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The procedure for issuing a writ of ''habeas corpus'' was first codified by the [[Habeas Corpus Act 1679]], following judicial rulings which had restricted the effectiveness of the writ. A previous law (the [[Habeas Corpus Act 1640]]) had been passed forty years earlier to overturn a ruling that the command of the King was a sufficient answer to a petition of ''habeas corpus''.&lt;ref&gt;Cohen, Maxwell. [http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals/canbarev18&amp;div=24 Habeas Corpus Cum Causa-The Emergence of the Modern Writ-II.] Can. B. Rev. 18 (1940): 172, 174-175.&lt;/ref&gt; The cornerstone purpose of the &lt;nowiki&gt;''writ of habeas corpus'' was to limit the King's Chancery's ability to undermine the surety of law by allowing courts of justice decisions to be overturned in favor and application of ''equity'', a process managed by the Chancelor (a bishop) with the King'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s authority.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/images/public_education/05_mar08_habeascorpus_landman.pdf|title=Understanding Habeas Corpus|last=Landman|first=James|date=|website=American Bar Association|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1679 codification of ''habeas corpus'' took place in the context of a [[Exclusion crisis|sharp confrontation]] between King [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] and the [[British Parliament|Parliament]], which was dominated by the then sharply oppositional, nascent [[Whigs (British political party)|Whig Party]]. The Whig leaders had good reasons to fear the King moving against them through the courts (as indeed happened in 1681) and regarded ''habeas corpus'' as safeguarding their own persons. The short-lived Parliament which made this enactment came to be known as the ''[[Habeas Corpus Parliament]]'' - being dissolved by the King immediately afterwards.

Then, as now, the writ of ''habeas corpus'' was issued by a superior court in the name of the Sovereign, and commanded the addressee (a lower court, sheriff, or private subject) to produce the prisoner before the royal courts of law. A ''habeas corpus'' petition could be made by the prisoner him or herself or by a third party on his or her behalf and, as a result of the Habeas Corpus Acts, could be made regardless of whether the court was in session, by presenting the petition to a judge. Since the 18th century the writ has also been used in cases of unlawful detention by private individuals, most famously in ''[[Somersett's Case]]'' (1772), where the black slave Somersett was ordered to be freed.&lt;ref&gt;Frederick Charles Moncreiff (2006). "The Wit and Wisdom of the Bench and Bar", pp.85–86. The Lawbook Exchange, Ltd.&lt;/ref&gt; During that case, these famous words are said to have been uttered: "The air of England has long been too pure for a slave, and every man is free who breathes it".&lt;ref&gt;George Birkbeck Hil (2004) [https://books.google.com/books?id=2EQCXQ0IbUkC&amp;pg=PA364&amp;dq=The+air+of+England+has+long+been+too+pure+for+a+slave,+and+every+man+is+free+who+breathes+it.&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2#v=onepage&amp;q=The%20air%20of%20England%20has%20long%20been%20too%20pure%20for%20a%20slave%2C%20and%20every%20man%20is%20free%20who%20breathes%20it. Life of Johnson, Volume 3] Kessinger Publishing, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Seven Years' War]] and later conflicts, the Writ was used on behalf of soldiers and sailors [[Impressment|pressed]] into military and naval service.&lt;ref&gt;Costello, Kevin, Habeas Corpus and Military and Naval Impressment 1756–1816, The Journal of Legal History 29.2 215 (2008)&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Habeas Corpus Act 1816]] introduced some changes and expanded the territoriality of the legislation.

The privilege of ''habeas corpus'' has been suspended or restricted several times during [[English history]], most recently during the 18th and 19th centuries. Although internment without trial has been authorised by statute since that time, for example during the two [[World War]]s and the [[The Troubles|Troubles]] in [[Northern Ireland]], the ''habeas corpus'' procedure has in modern times always technically remained available to such internees. However, as ''habeas corpus'' is only a procedural device to examine the lawfulness of a prisoner's detention, so long as the detention is in accordance with an [[Act of Parliament]], the petition for ''habeas corpus'' is unsuccessful. Since the passage of the [[Human Rights Act 1998]], the courts have been able to declare an Act of Parliament to be incompatible with the [[European Convention on Human Rights]], but such a declaration of incompatibility has no legal effect unless and until it is acted upon by the government.&lt;ref&gt;[https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/jt200607/jtselect/jtrights/128/12807.htm Joint Committee On Human Rights Sixteenth Report]&lt;/ref&gt;

The wording of the writ of ''habeas corpus'' implies that the prisoner is brought to the court for the legality of the imprisonment to be examined. However, rather than issuing the writ immediately and waiting for the return of the writ by the custodian, modern practice in England is for the original application to be followed by a hearing with both parties present to decide the legality of the detention, without any writ being issued. If the detention is held to be unlawful, the prisoner can usually then be released or [[bail]]ed by order of the court without having to be produced before it. With the development of modern public law, applications for habeas corpus have been to some extent discouraged, in favour of applications for [[judicial review]].&lt;ref&gt;Re (Habeas Corpus) [1996] QB 599; Re B [1991] 1 FLR 106&lt;/ref&gt; The writ, however, maintains its vigour, and was held by the UK Supreme Court to be available in respect of a prisoner captured by British forces in Afghanistan, albeit that the Secretary of State made a valid return to the writ justifying the detention of the claimant.&lt;ref&gt;[[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs v Rahmatullah]] [2012] UKSC 48&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other jurisdictions==
===Australia===
The writ of ''habeas corpus'' as a procedural remedy is part of [[Australia]]'s English law inheritance.&lt;ref&gt;Clark, David and Gerard McCoy (1998), "Habeas Corpus" (Federation Press)&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, the [[Australian parliament]] passed the [[Australian Anti-Terrorism Act 2005]]. Some legal experts questioned the constitutionality of the act, due in part to limitations it placed on ''habeas corpus''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Human Rights Guide to Australia's Counter-Terrorism Laws|url=https://www.humanrights.gov.au/human-rights-guide-australias-counter-terrorism-laws|website=Australian Human Rights Commission|accessdate=13 April 2015|date=2012-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=UNESCOZ&gt;{{cite web|title=National security and anti-terrorism laws in Australia|url=http://www.thenewsmanual.net/Resources/medialaw_in_australia_06.html|website=The News Manual|publisher=UNESCO|accessdate=13 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rix|first1=Mark|title=Australia's Anti-Terrorism Legislation - The national security state and the community legal sector.|journal=Research Online - University of Wollongong|date=2006|url=http://ro.uow.edu.au/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1003&amp;context=gsbpapers|accessdate=13 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canada===
''Habeas corpus'' rights are part of the British legal tradition inherited by Canada. The rights exist in the common law but have been enshrined in the [[Constitution Act 1982]], under [[Section Ten of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|Section Ten]] of the [[Charter of Rights and Freedoms]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://laws.justice.gc.ca/eng/Const/page-15.html |title=The Constitution Act, 1982; Part I, Section 10(c): Legal Rights |publisher=Canadian Department of Justice |accessdate=2 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This states that "Everyone has the right on arrest or detention&amp;nbsp;... (c) to have the validity of the detention determined by way of ''habeas corpus'' and to be released if the detention is not lawful".

Suspension of the writ in Canadian history occurred famously during the [[October Crisis]], during which the [[War Measures Act]] was invoked by the [[Governor General of Canada]] on the [[Advice (constitutional)|constitutional advice]] of Prime Minister [[Pierre Trudeau]], who had received a request from the [[Quebec]] Cabinet. The Act was also used to justify German, Slavic, and [[Ukrainian Canadian internment]] during the [[First World War]], and the internment of German-Canadians, Italian-Canadians and [[Japanese Canadian internment|Japanese-Canadians]] during the [[Second World War]]. The writ was suspended for several years following the [[Battle of Fort Erie (1866)]] during the [[Fenian Rising]], though the suspension was only ever applied to suspects in the [[Thomas D'Arcy McGee]] assassination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/obj/033001/f2/033001-1402.7-e.pdf |title=The Fenians in Canada |author=David A. Wilson |publisher=[[Library and Archives Canada]] |accessdate=2 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The writ is available where there is no other adequate remedy. However, a superior court always has the discretion to grant the writ even in the face of an alternative remedy (see ''May v Ferndale Institution'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite CanLII |litigants=May v Ferndale Institution |link= |year=2005 |court=scc |num=82 |parallelcite=[2005] 3 SCR 809 |date=2005-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the [[Criminal Code (Canada)|Criminal Code]] the writ is largely unavailable if a statutory right of appeal exists, whether or not this right has been exercised.

===France===
A fundamental human right in the "1789 [[Declaration of the Rights of Man]]" drafted by [[Gilbert du Motier, Marquis de Lafayette|Lafayette]] in cooperation with [[Thomas Jefferson]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.monticello.org/site/jefferson/marquis-de-lafayette|title=Marquis de Lafayette|publisher=Thomas Jefferson Encyclopedia|date=2014|accessdate=2014-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; the guarantees against arbitrary detention are enshrined in the French Constitution and regulated by the Penal Code. The safeguards are equivalent to those found under the Habeas-Corpus provisions found in Germany, the United States and several Commonwealth countries. The French system of accountability prescribes severe penalties for ministers, police officers and civil and judiciary authorities who either violate or fail to enforce the law.

"Article 7 of [1789] Declaration also provides that 'No individual may be accused, arrested, or detained except where the law so prescribes, and in accordance with the procedure it has laid down.' ... The Constitution further states that 'No one may be arbitrarily detained. The judicial authority, guardian of individual liberty, ensures the observance of this principle under the condition specified by law.' Its article 5 provides that everyone has the right to liberty and sets forth permissible circumstances under which people may be deprived of their liberty and procedural safeguards in case of detention. In particular, it states that 'anyone deprived of his liberty by arrest or detention shall be entitled to take proceedings by which the lawfulness of his detention shall be decided speedily by a court and his release ordered if the detention is not lawful'."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/law/help/habeas-corpus/france.php|title=Habeas Corpus Rights: France - Author - Nicole Atwill, Senior Foreign Law Specialist|publisher=U.S. Library of Congress|date=2009|accessdate=2014-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

France and the United States played a synergistic role in the international team, led by Eleanor Roosevelt, which crafted the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]]. The French judge and Nobel Peace Laureate [[René Cassin]] produced the first draft&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.droits-fondamentaux.org/spip.php?article42 |title="A World Made New, Eleanor Roosevelt and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights" de Mary Ann GLENDON - Author Emmanuel Decaux |publisher=Le Centre de recherche sur les droits de l'homme et le droit humanitaire, CRDH, Université Panthéon-Assas |accessdate=2014-06-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714114736/http://www.droits-fondamentaux.org/spip.php?article42 |archivedate=2014-07-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.un.org/en/documents/udhr/history.shtml |title=The Universal Declaration of Human Rights: History of The Document |publisher=The United Nations |accessdate=2014-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; and argued against arbitrary detentions. René Cassin and the French team subsequently championed the ''habeas corpus'' provisions enshrined in the [[European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cambridge.org/us/academic/subjects/history/twentieth-century-european-history/rene-cassin-and-human-rights-great-war-universal-declaration?format=HB |title=René Cassin and Human Rights: From the Great War to the Universal Declaration - Authors - Jay Winter, Antoine Prost |publisher=Cambridge University Press |date=June 2013 |accessdate=2013-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Germany===
Germany has constitutional guarantees against improper detention and these have been implemented in statutory law in a manner that can be considered as equivalent to writs of habeas corpus.

Article 104, paragraph 1 of the [[Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany]] provides that deprivations of liberty may be imposed only on the basis of a specific enabling statute that also must include procedural rules. Article 104, paragraph 2 requires that any arrested individual be brought before a judge by the end of the day following the day of the arrest. For those detained as criminal suspects, article 104, paragraph 3 specifically requires that the judge must grant a hearing to the suspect in order to rule on the detention.

Restrictions on the power of the authorities to arrest and detain individuals also emanate from article 2 paragraph 2 of the Basic Law which guarantees liberty and requires a statutory authorization for any deprivation of liberty. In addition, several other articles of the Basic Law have a bearing on the issue. The most important of these are article 19, which generally requires a statutory basis for any infringements of the fundamental rights guaranteed by the Basic Law while also guaranteeing judicial review; article 20, paragraph 3, which guarantees the rule of law; and article 3 which guarantees equality.

In particular, a constitutional obligation to grant remedies for improper detention is required by article 19, paragraph 4 of the Basic Law, which provides as follows: "Should any person's right be violated by public authority, he may have recourse to the courts. If no other jurisdiction has been established, recourse shall be to the ordinary courts."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.loc.gov/law/help/habeas-corpus/germany.php |title=Habeas Corpus Rights: Germany&amp;#124;Law Library of Congress |publisher=Loc.gov |date= March 2009|accessdate=2013-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===India===
The Indian judiciary, in a catena of cases, has effectively resorted to the writ of ''habeas corpus'' to secure release of a person from illegal detention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Baxi |first1=Pratiksha (April 2009 - Reprint 2012) |title=Habeas Corpus Juridical Narratives of Sexual Governance |url=http://www.jnu.ac.in/cslg/workingPaper/09-Habeus%20%28Pratiksha%20Baxi%29.pdf |publisher=Centre for the Study of Law and Governance Jawaharlal Nehru University, New Delhi |accessdate=23 November 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161006125237/http://www.jnu.ac.in/cslg/workingPaper/09-Habeus%20%28Pratiksha%20Baxi%29.pdf |archivedate=6 October 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in October 2009, the Karnataka High Court heard a ''habeas corpus'' petition filed by the parents of a girl who married a Muslim boy from Kannur district and was allegedly confined in a ''madrasa'' in Malapuram town.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/love-jihad-court-unhappy-with-probe/article169724.ece|title='Love Jihad': court unhappy with probe|date=27 Oct 2009|newspaper=The Hindu}}&lt;/ref&gt; Usually, in most other jurisdictions, the writ is directed at police authorities. The extension to non-state authorities has its grounds in two cases: the 1898 [[Queen's Bench]] case of ''[[Ex Parte]] [[Proctor#Disciplinary functions|Daisy Hopkins]]'', wherein the Proctor of Cambridge University did detain and arrest Hopkins without his jurisdiction, and Hopkins was released,&lt;ref&gt;''Exparte, Hopkins'' (Daisy) (1891) 56 JP 262; 61 LJQB 240&lt;/ref&gt; and that of ''[[Somerset v Stewart]]'', in which an African slave whose master had moved to London was freed by action of the writ.

The Indian judiciary has dispensed with the traditional doctrine of ''[[locus standi]]'', so that if a detained person is not in a position to file a petition, it can be moved on his behalf by any other person. The scope of ''habeas'' relief has expanded in recent times by actions of the Indian judiciary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.legalserviceindia.com/articles/wha.htm |title=Writ Of Habeas Corpus For Securing Liberty - Author - ABS-CBN News |publisher=Legalserviceindia.com |date= |accessdate=2010-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1976, the ''habeas'' writ was used in the [[Rajan case]], a student victim of torture in local police custody during the nationwide [[The Emergency (India)|Emergency]] in India. On 12 March 2014, [[Subrata Roy]]'s counsel approached the Chief Justice moving a ''habeas corpus'' petition. It was also filed by the Panthers Party to protest the imprisonment of [[Anna Hazare]], a social activist.

===Ireland===
In the [[Republic of Ireland]], the writ of ''habeas corpus'' is available at common law and under the Habeas Corpus Acts of 1782 and 1816. A remedy equivalent to ''habeas corpus'' is also guaranteed by Article 40 of the [[Constitution of Ireland|1937 constitution]].

The article guarantees that "no citizen shall be deprived of his personal liberty save in accordance with law" and outlines a specific procedure for the [[High Court (Ireland)|High Court]] to enquire into the lawfulness of any person's detention. It does not mention the Latin term, ''habeas corpus'', but includes the English phrase "produce the body".

Article 40.4.2° provides that a prisoner, or anyone acting on his behalf, may make a complaint to the High Court (or to any High Court judge) of unlawful detention. The court must then investigate the matter "forthwith" and may order that the defendant bring the prisoner before the court and give reasons for his detention. The court must immediately release the detainee unless it is satisfied that he is being held lawfully. The remedy is available not only to prisoners of the state, but also to persons unlawfully detained by any private party. However the constitution provides that the procedure is not binding on the [[Irish Defence Forces|Defence Forces]] during a state of war or armed rebellion.

The full text of Article 40.4.2° is as follows: {{quote|Upon complaint being made by or on behalf of any person to the High Court or any judge thereof alleging that such person is being unlawfully detained, the High Court and any and every judge thereof to whom such complaint is made shall forthwith enquire into the said complaint and may order the person in whose custody such person is detained to ''produce the body'' of such person before the High Court on a named day and to certify in writing the grounds of his detention, and the High Court shall, upon the body of such person being produced before that Court and after giving the person in whose custody he is detained an opportunity of justifying the detention, order the release of such person from such detention unless satisfied that he is being detained in accordance with the law. [''Italics'' added]}}

The writ of ''habeas corpus'' continued as part of the Irish law when the state seceded from the [[United Kingdom]] in 1922. A remedy equivalent to ''habeas corpus'' was also guaranteed by Article 6 of the [[Constitution of the Irish Free State]], enacted in 1922. That article used similar wording to Article 40.4 of the current constitution, which replaced it 1937.

The relationship between the Article 40 and the Habeas Corpus Acts of 1782 and 1816 is ambiguous, and Forde and Leonard write that "The extent if any to which Art 40.4 has replaced these Acts has yet to be determined". In ''The State (Ahern) v Cotter'' (1982) Walsh J opined that the ancient writ referred to in the Habeas Corpus Acts remains in existence in Irish law as a separate remedy from that provided for in Article 40.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Forde, David Leonard, ''Constitutional Law of Ireland'', 2013, pp. 371-372.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1941, the Article 40 procedure was restricted by the [[Second Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland|Second Amendment]]. Prior to the amendment, a prisoner had the constitutional right to apply to any [[High Court of the Republic of Ireland|High Court]] judge for an enquiry into her detention, and to as many High Court judges as she wished. If the prisoner successfully challenged her detention before the High Court she was entitled to immediate, unconditional release.

The Second Amendment provided that a prisoner has only the right to apply to a single judge, and, once a writ has been issued, the President of the High Court has authority to choose the judge or panel of three judges who will decide the case. If the High Court finds that the prisoner's detention is unlawful due to the unconstitutionality of a law the judge must refer the matter to the [[Irish Supreme Court|Supreme Court]], and until the Supreme's Court's decision is rendered the prisoner may be released only on bail.

The power of the state to detain persons prior to trial was extended by the [[Sixteenth Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland|Sixteenth Amendment]], in 1996. In 1965, the Supreme Court ruled in the ''O'Callaghan'' case that the constitution required that an individual charged with a crime could be refused bail only if she was likely to flee or to interfere with witnesses or evidence. Since the Sixteenth Amendment, it has been possible for a court to take into account whether a person has committed serious crimes while on bail in the past.

===Italy===
The right to freedom from arbitrary detention is guaranteed by Article 13 of the [[Constitution of Italy]], which states:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Italian Constitution|url=http://www.quirinale.it/page/costituzione|publisher=The official website of the Presidency of the Italian Republic}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{quote|Personal liberty is inviolable. No one may be detained, inspected, or searched nor otherwise subjected to any restriction of personal liberty except by order of the Judiciary stating a reason and only in such cases and in such manner as provided by the law. In exceptional circumstances and under such conditions of necessity and urgency as shall conclusively be defined by the law, the police may take provisional measures that shall be referred within 48 hours to the Judiciary for validation and which, in default of such validation in the following 48 hours, shall be revoked and considered null and void. Any act of physical and moral violence against a person subjected to restriction of personal liberty shall be punished. The law shall establish the maximum duration of preventive detention.}}

===Malaysia===
In [[Malaysia]], the remedy of ''habeas corpus'' is guaranteed by the federal constitution, although not by name. Article 5(2) of the [[Constitution of Malaysia]] provides that "Where complaint is made to a High Court or any judge thereof that a person is being unlawfully detained the court shall inquire into the complaint and, unless satisfied that the detention is lawful, shall order him to be produced before the court and release him".

As there are several statutes, for example, the [[Internal Security Act (Malaysia)|Internal Security Act 1960]], that still permit detention without trial, the procedure is usually effective in such cases only if it can be shown that there was a procedural error in the way that the detention was ordered.

===New Zealand===
In [[New Zealand]], ''habeas corpus'' may be invoked against the government or private individuals. In 2006, a child was allegedly kidnapped by his maternal grandfather after a custody dispute. The father began ''habeas corpus'' proceedings against the mother, the grandfather, the grandmother, the great grandmother, and another person alleged to have assisted in the kidnap of the child.

Issuance of a writ is an exercise of an extraordinary jurisdiction of the superior courts in Pakistan. A writ of habeas corpus may be issued by any High Court of a province in Pakistan. Article 199 of the [[Constitution of Pakistan|1973 Constitution]] of the [[Islamic Republic of Pakistan]], specifically provides for the issuance of a writ of habeas corpus, empowering the courts to exercise this prerogative. Subject to the Article 199 of the Constitution, "A High Court may, if it is satisfied that no other adequate remedy is provided by law, on the application of any person, make an order that a person in custody within the territorial jurisdiction of the Court be brought before it so that the Court may satisfy itself that he is not being held in custody without a lawful authority or in an unlawful manner". The hallmark of extraordinary constitutional jurisdiction is to keep various functionaries of State within the ambit of their authority. Once a High Court has assumed jurisdiction to adjudicate the matter before it, justiciability of the issue raised before it is beyond question. The Supreme Court of Pakistan has stated clearly that the use of words "in an unlawful manner" implies that the court may examine, if a statute has allowed such detention, whether it was a colorable exercise of the power of authority. Thus, the court can examine the malafides of the action taken.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/law/help/habeas-corpus/pakistan.php|title=Habeas Corpus Rights: Pakistan|work=loc.gov|date=March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Philippines===
In the Bill of Rights of the Philippine constitution, ''habeas corpus'' is guaranteed in terms almost identically to those used in the U.S. Constitution. in Article 3, Section 15 of the [[Constitution of the Philippines]] states that "The privilege of the writ of ''habeas corpus'' shall not be suspended except in cases of invasion or rebellion when the public safety requires it".

In 1971, after the [[Plaza Miranda bombing]], the Marcos administration, under [[Ferdinand Marcos]], suspended ''habeas corpus'' in an effort to stifle the oncoming insurgency, having blamed the [[Communist Party of the Philippines|Filipino Communist Party]] for the events of August 21. Many considered this to be a prelude to [[martial law]]. After widespread protests, however, the Arroyo administration decided to reintroduce the writ. In December 2009, ''habeas corpus'' was suspended in Maguindanao as the province was placed under martial law. This occurred in response to the [[Maguindanao massacre]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=andoybarrios on Sat, 12/05/2009 - 23:08|url=http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/nation/12/04/09/arroyo-orders-martial-law-maguindanao|title=Arroyo proclaims martial law in Maguindanao - ABS-CBN News Online|publisher=Abs-cbnnews.com|date=2009-12-05|accessdate=2010-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, President [[Rodrigo Duterte]] said he was planning on suspending the habeas corpus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rappler.com/nation/152167-duterte-suspend-writ-habeas-corpus-warning|title=Duterte to suspend writ of habeas corpus if 'forced'|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 23, 2017 at 10&amp;nbsp;pm Philippine time, President [[Rodrigo Duterte]] declared martial law in the whole island of Mindanao including Sulu and Tawi-tawi for the period of 60 days due to the series of attacks mounted by the [[Maute group]], an ISIS-linked terrorist organization. The declaration suspends the writ.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.philstar.com/headlines/2017/05/23/1703088/duterte-declares-martial-law-mindanao|title=Duterte declares martial law in Mindanao|accessdate=2017-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scotland===
The [[Parliament of Scotland]] passed a law to have the same effect as ''habeas corpus'' in the 18th century. This is now known as the Criminal Procedure Act 1701 c.6.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/content.aspx?ActiveTextDocId=1519689 Full text of the Act]. This law was given its current short title by the [[Statute Law Revision (Scotland) Act 1964]]&lt;/ref&gt; It was originally called "the Act for preventing wrongful imprisonment and against undue delays in trials". It is still in force although certain parts have been repealed.

===Spain===
The present [[Constitution of Spain]] states that "A ''habeas corpus'' procedure shall be provided for by law to ensure the immediate handing over to the judicial authorities of any person illegally arrested". The statute which regulates the procedure is the ''Law of Habeas Corpus of 24 May 1984'', which provides that a person imprisoned may, on her or his own or through a third person, allege that she or he is imprisoned unlawfully and request to appear before a judge. The request must specify the grounds on which the detention is considered to be unlawful, which can be, for example, that the custodian holding the prisoner does not have the legal authority, that the prisoner's constitutional rights have been violated, or that he has been subjected to mistreatment. The judge may then request additional information if needed, and may issue a ''habeas corpus'' order, at which point the custodian has 24 hours to bring the prisoner before the judge.

Historically, many of the territories of Spain had remedies equivalent to the ''habeas corpus'', such as the privilege of ''manifestación'' in the [[Crown or Aragon]] or the right of the Tree in [[Biscay]].

===United States===
{{Main|Habeas corpus in the United States}}
&lt;!-- This section is only a BRIEF SUMMARY. Please consider adding extra material to the main article instead! --&gt;
The United States inherited ''habeas corpus'' from the [[English common law]]. In England, the writ was issued in the name of the monarch. When the original [[Thirteen Colonies|thirteen American colonies]] declared independence, and became a republic based on popular sovereignty, any person, in the name of the people, acquired authority to initiate such writs. The [[United States Constitution|U.S. Constitution]] specifically includes the ''habeas'' procedure in the [[Suspension Clause]] (Clause 2), located in [[Article One of the United States Constitution|Article One]], Section 9. This states that "The privilege of the writ of ''habeas corpus'' shall not be suspended, unless when in cases of rebellion or invasion the public safety may require it".

The writ of ''habeas corpus ad subjiciendum'' is a civil, not criminal, ''[[ex parte]]'' proceeding in which a court inquires as to the legitimacy of a prisoner's custody. Typically, ''habeas corpus'' proceedings are to determine whether the court that imposed sentence on the defendant had jurisdiction and authority to do so, or whether the defendant's sentence has expired. ''Habeas corpus'' is also used as a legal avenue to challenge other types of custody such as pretrial detention or detention by the [[U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement|United States Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement]] pursuant to a deportation proceeding.

Presidents [[Abraham Lincoln]] and [[Ulysses Grant]] suspended ''habeas corpus'' during the Civil War and Reconstruction for some places or types of cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://usgovinfo.about.com/od/historicdocuments/a/lincolnhabeas.htm |title=Abraham Lincoln's 1862 Proclamation Suspending Habeas Corpus |publisher=Usgovinfo.about.com |date= |accessdate=2013-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=70261 |title=Ulysses S. Grant: Proclamation 204 – Suspending the Writ of Habeas Corpus in the County of Union, South Carolina |publisher=Presidency.ucsb.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; During [[World War II]], President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] suspended habeas corpus. Following the [[September 11 attacks]], President [[George W. Bush]] attempted to place [[Guantanamo Bay]] detainees outside of the jurisdiction of ''habeas corpus'', but the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] overturned this action in ''[[Boumediene v. Bush]]''.

==Equivalent remedies==
===Biscay===
In 1526, the ''Fuero Nuevo of the Señorío de Vizcaya'' (''New Charter of the Lordship of Biscay'') established a form of ''habeas corpus'' in the territory of the ''[[Lord of Biscay|Señorío de Vizcaya]]'', nowadays part of [[Spain]]. This revised version of the ''Fuero Viejo'' (Old Charter) of 1451 codified the medieval custom whereby no person could be arbitrarily detained without being summoned first to the [[Gernikako Arbola|Oak of Gernika]], an ancestral oak tree located in the outskirts of [[Gernika]] under which all laws of the Lordship of Biscay were passed.

The New Charter formalised that no one could be detained without a court order (Law 26 of Chapter 9) nor due to debts (Law 3 of Chapter 16). It also established that no one could be arrested without previously having been summoned to the [[Gernikako Arbola|Oak of Gernika]] and given 30 days to answer the said summon, and that upon presenting themselves under the Tree, they had to be provided with all evidence and accusations so that they could defend themselves (Law 7 of Chapter 9). No one could be sent to prison or deprived of their freedom until being formally trialed, and no one could be accused of a different crime until their current court trial was over (Law 5 of Chapter 5). Those fearing they were being arrested illegally could appeal to the ''Regimiento General'' that their rights could be upheld. The ''Regimiento'' (the executive arm of the [[Juntas Generales]] of Biscay) would demand the prisoner be handed over to them, and thereafter the prisoner would be released and placed under the protection of the Regimiento while awaiting for trial.&lt;ref&gt;Trask, L. The History of Basque Routledge: 1997 {{ISBN|0-415-13116-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Crown of Aragon===
The [[Crown of Aragon]] also had a remedy equivalent to the ''habeas corpus'' called the ''manifestación de personas'' (literally, ''demonstration of persons'').&lt;ref&gt;R.E. Giesey, If not, not: The Oath of the Aragonese and the Legendary Laws of Sobrarbe. Princeton University Press, 1968&lt;/ref&gt; According to the right of ''manifestación'', the [[Justicia de Aragon]] (lit. ''Justice of Aragon'', an Aragonese judiciary figure similar to an [[ombudsman]], but with far reaching executive powers) could require a judge, a court of justice, or any other official that they handed over to the ''Justicia'' (i.e., that they ''demonstrated'') anyone being prosecuted so as to guarantee that this person's rights were upheld, and that no violence would befall this person prior to him being sentenced.&lt;ref name="Tomás y Valiente 2000"&gt;Tomás y Valiente, Francisco (2000). La tortura judicial en España (2ª edición). Barcelona: Crítica. {{ISBN|84-8432-029-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the ''Justicia'' retained the right to examine the judgement and decide whether it satisfied the conditions of a fair trial; if the ''Justicia'' was not satisfied, he could refuse to hand the accused back to the authorities. The right of ''manifestación'' acted like an habeas corpus: knowing that the appeal to the ''Justicia'' would immediately follow any unlawful detention, these were effectively illegal. Equally, [[torture]] (which had been banned since 1325 in Aragon) could never take place.&lt;ref name="Tomás y Valiente 2000"/&gt; In some cases, people exerting their right of manifestación were kept under the Justicia's watch in ''manifestación'' prisons (famous for their mild and easy conditions) or house arrest; more generally however, the person was released from confinement and placed under the ''Justicia's protection'', awaiting trial. The ''Justicia'' always granted the right of ''manifestación'' by default, but they only really had to act in extreme cases, as for instance famously happened in 1590 when [[Antonio Pérez (statesman)|Antonio Pérez]], the disgraced secretary to [[Philip II of Spain]], fled from [[Castile (historical region)|Castile]] to Aragon and used his Aragonese ascendency to appeal to the ''Justicia'' for manifestación right, and therefore prevent his arrest at the King's behest.

The right of ''manifestación'' was codified in 1325 in the [[Declaratio Privilegii generalis]] passed by the [[Aragonese Corts]] under king [[James II of Aragon]].&lt;ref&gt;González Antón, Luis, ''Las Uniones aragonesas y las Cortes del Reino (1283-1301)'', Zaragoza, Escuela de Estudios Medievales; CSIC; Librería General, 1975. {{ISBN|978-84-00-04150-2}} [http://books.google.es/books?id=sIYVCrzY8-4C&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PP1#v=onepage Vol I. Texto]. {{ISBN|978-84-00-04151-9}} [http://books.google.es/books?id=FVbKFaPne8sC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PP1#v=onepage Vol. II. Documentos]. {{ISBN|978-84-00-04177-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; It had been practiced since the inception of the kingdom of Aragon in the 11th century, and therefore predates the ''habeas corpus'' itself.&lt;ref name="Tomás y Valiente 2000"/&gt;

===Poland===
In 1430, King [[Władysław II Jagiełło]] of Poland granted the Privilege of [[Jedlnia]], which proclaimed, ''[[Neminem captivabimus]] nisi iure victum'' ("We will not imprison anyone except if convicted by law"). This revolutionary innovation in civil [[libertarianism]] gave Polish citizens due process-style rights that did not exist in any other European country for another 250 years. Originally, the Privilege of Jedlnia was restricted to the nobility (the [[szlachta]]), but it was extended to cover townsmen in the [[Constitution of 3rd May|1791 Constitution]]. Importantly, social classifications in the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]] were not as rigid as in other European countries; townspeople and Jews were sometimes ennobled. The Privilege of Jedlnia provided broader coverage than many subsequently enacted habeas corpus laws because Poland's nobility constituted an unusually large percentage of the country's total population, which was Europe's largest. As a result, by the 16th century, it was protecting the liberty of between five hundred thousand and a million Poles.&lt;ref&gt;[http://indylaw.indiana.edu/instructors/cole/web%20page/polconst.pdf Poland's 1997 Constitution in Its Historical Context]; Daniel H. Cole, Indiana University School of Law, September 22, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

===Roman-Dutch law===
In [[South Africa]] and other countries whose legal systems are based on [[Roman-Dutch law]], the ''[[interdictum de homine libero exhibendo]]'' is the equivalent of the writ of ''habeas corpus''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Murdoch |last=Watney |title=Arrest, detention and the ''interdictum de homine libero exhibendo'' |journal=Journal of South African Law |volume=2011 |year=2011 |number=3 |pages=555–562 |url=http://reference.sabinet.co.za/webx/access/electronic_journals/ju_tsar/ju_tsar_2011_n3_a10.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; In South Africa, it has been entrenched in the [[Bill of Rights (South Africa)|Bill of Rights]], which provides in section 35(2)(d) that every detained person has the right to challenge the lawfulness of the detention in person before a court and, if the detention is unlawful, to be released.

==World ''habeas corpus''==
In the 1950s, American lawyer [[Luis Kutner]] began advocating an international writ of ''habeas corpus'' to protect individual human rights. In 1952, he filed a petition for a "United Nations Writ of Habeas Corpus" on behalf of [[William N. Oatis]], an American journalist jailed the previous year by the Communist government of [[Czechoslovakia]].&lt;ref&gt;The petition was titled "United Nations Ex Rel., Luis Kutner, For and on Behalf of William N. Oatis, Petitioner, v. Czechoslovakia, Respondent - Petition of Luis Kutner For and on Behalf of William N. Oatis, For a United Nations Writ of Habeas Corpus." See [http://cornelllawreview.org/files/2013/03/Jacksonfinal.pdf Vicki C. Jackson, "World Habeas Corpus", 91 Cornell Law Review 303, 309 (January 2006).] (PDF)&lt;/ref&gt; Alleging that Czechoslovakia had violated Oatis's rights under the [[United Nations Charter]] and the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] and that the [[United Nations General Assembly]] had "inherent power" to fashion remedies for human rights violations, the petition was filed with the [[United Nations Commission on Human Rights]].&lt;ref name=Jackson&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://cornelllawreview.org/files/2013/03/Jacksonfinal.pdf|format=PDF|first=Vicki C. |last=Jackson|title=World Habeas Corpus |volume=91 Cornell Law Review 303, 309-314 |year=January 2006|website=cornelllawreview.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Commission forwarded the petition to Czechoslovakia, but no other United Nations action was taken.&lt;ref name=Jackson/&gt; Oatis was released in 1953. Kutner went on to publish numerous articles and books advocating the creation of an "International Court of Habeas Corpus".&lt;ref&gt;His first article was "A Proposal for a United Nations Writ of Habeas Corpus and International Court of Human Rights", Tulane Law Review, 28 (June 1954): 417-441. See also, Luis Kutner, ''World Habeas Corpus'', Dobbs Ferry, NY: Oceana, 1962, p. 266, for his draft of a "Treaty-Statute of the International Court of Habeas Corpus".&lt;/ref&gt;

==International human rights standards==
Article 3 of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] provides that "everyone has the right to life, liberty and security of person". [[Article 5 of the European Convention on Human Rights]] goes further and calls for persons detained to have the right to challenge their detention, providing at article 5.4: {{quote|Everyone who is deprived of his liberty by arrest or detention shall be entitled to take proceedings by which the lawfulness of his detention shall be decided speedily by a court and his release ordered if the detention is not lawful.}}

{{Taxation in the Ottoman Empire sidebar}}
'''Haraç'''  ({{lang-hy|խարջ / kharj}}, {{lang-mk|arač / арач}}, {{lang-gr|χαράτσι / charatsi}}, {{lang-sh|харач / harač}}) was a land tax levied on [[non-Muslim]]s in the [[Ottoman Empire]].

''Haraç'' was developed from an earlier form of land taxation, ''[[kharaj]]'' (''harac''), and was, in principle, only payable by non-Muslims; it was seen as a counterpart to [[zakat]] paid by [[Muslims]].&lt;ref name =Hunter&gt;Hunter, Malik and Senturk, p. 77&lt;/ref&gt; The ''haraç'' system later merged into the [[cizye]] taxation system.

Haraç collection was reformed by a [[firman]] of 1834, which abolished the old levying system, and required that ''haraç'' be raised by a commission composed of the [[kadı]] and the ''ayans'', or municipal chiefs of ''[[Rayah|rayas]]'' in each district. The firman made several other changes to taxation.

'''Hyperreality''', in [[semiotics]] and [[postmodernism]], is an inability of [[consciousness]] to distinguish [[reality]] from a simulation of reality, especially in technologically advanced postmodern [[Society|societies]]. Hyperreality is seen as a condition in which what is real and what is fiction are seamlessly blended together so that there is no clear distinction between where one ends and the other begins.&lt;ref name="Tiffin"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tiffin|first=John|author2=Nobuyoshi Terashima|title=Paradigm for the third millennium|journal=Hyperreality|year=2005|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; It allows the co-mingling of physical [[reality]] with [[virtual reality]] (VR) and [[Intelligence#Human intelligence|human intelligence]] with [[artificial intelligence]] (AI).&lt;ref name="Tiffin" /&gt; Individuals may find themselves, for different reasons, more in tune or involved with the hyperreal world and less with the physical real world. Some famous theorists of hyperreality/hyperrealism include [[Jean Baudrillard]], [[Albert Borgmann]], [[Daniel J. Boorstin]], [[Neil Postman]] and [[Umberto Eco]].

==Origins and usage==
The postmodern semiotic concept of "hyperreality" was contentiously coined by French sociologist [[Jean Baudrillard]] in ''[[Simulacra and Simulation]]''. Baudrillard defined "hyperreality" as "the generation by models of a real without origin or reality";&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Baudrillard|first=Jean|title=Simulacra &amp; Simulation|year=1994|publisher=University of Michigan Press|location=The Precession of Simulacra|page=1|url=https://www9.georgetown.edu/faculty/irvinem/theory/baudrillard-simulacra_and_simulation.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120309115319/https://www9.georgetown.edu/faculty/irvinem/theory/baudrillard-simulacra_and_simulation.pdf|archivedate=2012-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; hyperreality is a representation, a sign, without an original referent. Baudrillard believes hyperreality goes further than confusing or blending the 'real' with the symbol which represents it; it involves creating a symbol or set of signifiers which represent something that does not actually exist, like Santa Claus. Baudrillard in particular suggests that the world we live in has been replaced by a copy world, where we seek simulated stimuli and nothing more. Baudrillard borrows, from [[Jorge Luis Borges]]' "[[On Exactitude in Science]]" (already borrowed from [[Lewis Carroll]]),the example of a society whose [[Cartography|cartographers]] create a map so detailed that it covers the very things it was designed to represent. When the empire declines, the map fades into the landscape.  He says that, in such a case, neither the representation nor the real remains, just the hyperreal.  Baudrillard's idea of hyperreality was heavily influenced by [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]], [[semiotics]], and [[Marshall McLuhan]]. Baudrillard challenges McLuhan's famous statement that the 'medium is the message', by suggesting that information devours its own content. Hyperreality is the inability of consciousness to distinguish reality from a simulation of reality, especially in technologically advanced societies.&lt;ref&gt;Zompetti, J. P., &amp; Moffitt, M. A. (2008). Revisiting Concepts of Public Relations Audience Through Postmodern Concepts of Metanarrative, Decentered Subject, and Reality/Hyperreality. Journal of Promotion Management, 14(3/4), 275-291. doi:10.1080/10496490802623762.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Baudrillard's hyperreality theory goes a step further than McLuhan's medium theory: "There is not only an implosion of the message in the medium, there is, in the same movement, the implosion of the medium itself in the real, the implosion of the medium and of the real in a sort of hyperreal nebula, in which even the definition and distinct action of the medium can no longer be determined".&lt;ref name="Laughey, D. 2010"&gt;Laughey, D. (2010). Key themes in media theory. Maidenhead: Open University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Italian author [[Umberto Eco]] explores the notion of hyperreality further by suggesting that the action of hyperreality is to desire reality and in the attempt to achieve that desire, to fabricate a false reality that is to be consumed as real.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Eco |first=Umberto |title=Travels in Hyperreality |url=http://public.callutheran.edu/~brint/American/Eco.pdf |work=The fortress of Solitude |accessdate=16 March 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130521085018/http://public.callutheran.edu/~brint/American/Eco.pdf |archivedate=21 May 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Linked to contemporary [[western culture]] Umberto Eco and [[Post-structuralism|post-structuralists]] would argue, that in current cultures fundamental ideals are built on desire and particular [[Sign system|sign-systems]].

Hyperreality can also be thought of as "reality by proxy"; simply put, an individual takes on someone else's version of reality and claims it as his or her own. For example, persons who watch soap operas for an extended period of time may develop a view of interpersonal relationships (reality) that are skewed by how the writers depict the characters and situations within the show. Individuals may begin to believe that these extreme dramatic relationships are authentic and real, and they may begin to judge social relationships and situations by this heightened lens of reality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Crystal|first=Garry|title=What is Hyperreality|url=http://www.wisegeek.org/what-is-hyperreality.htm|publisher=wiseGEEK|accessdate=16 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Significance ==
Hyperreality is significant as a [[paradigm]] to explain current cultural conditions. [[Consumerism]], because of its reliance on sign exchange value (e.g. brand X shows that one is fashionable, car Y indicates one's wealth), could be seen as a contributing factor in the creation of hyperreality or the hyperreal condition. Hyperreality tricks consciousness into detaching from any real emotional engagement, instead opting for artificial simulation, and endless reproductions of fundamentally empty appearance. Essentially (although Baudrillard himself may balk at the use of this word), fulfillment or [[happiness]] is found through simulation and imitation of a transient [[simulacrum]] of reality, rather than any interaction with any "real" [[reality]].

While hyperreality is not a relatively new concept, its effects are more relevant today than when it was first conceptualized.{{Citation needed|date=February 2017}} This is attributed to the way it effectively captured the postmodern condition, particularly how people in the postmodern world seek stimulation by creating unreal worlds of spectacle and seduction and nothing more.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Contemporary Social and Sociological Theory: Visualizing Social Worlds|last=Allan|first=Kenneth|publisher=SAGE|year=2010|isbn=9781412978200|location=Thousand Oaks, CA|pages=311}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There are dangers to the use of hyperreality within our culture; individuals may observe and accept hyperreal images as role models when the images don't necessarily represent real physical people. This can result in a desire to strive for an unobtainable ideal, or it may lead to a lack of unimpaired role models. [[Daniel J. Boorstin]] cautions against confusing celebrity worship with hero worship, "we come dangerously close to depriving ourselves of all real models. We lose sight of the men and women who do not simply seem great because they are famous but who are famous because they are great".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Boorstin|first=Daniel J.|title=The Image: A Guide to Pseudo-Events in America|year=1992|publisher=Random House|location=New York, NY|page=48}}&lt;/ref&gt; He bemoans the loss of old heroes like [[Moses]], [[Ulysses S. Grant]], [[Aeneas]], [[Jesus]], [[Julius Caesar]], [[Muhammad|Muhammed]], [[Joan of Arc]], [[William Shakespeare]], [[George Washington]], [[Napoleon]], and [[Abraham Lincoln]], who did not have [[public relations]] (PR) agencies to construct hyperreal images of themselves. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Boorstin|first=Daniel J.|title=The Image: A Guide to Pseudo-Events in America|year=1992|publisher=Random House|location=New York, NY|page=49}}&lt;/ref&gt; The dangers of hyperreality are also facilitated by information technologies, which provide tools to dominant powers that seek to encourage it to drive consumption and materialism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Knowledge and Critical Pedagogy: An Introduction|last=Kincheloe|first=Joe|publisher=Springer Science+Business Media|year=2008|isbn=9781402082238|location=New York|pages=206}}&lt;/ref&gt; The danger in the pursuit of stimulation and seduction emerge not in the lack of meaning but, as Baudrillard maintained, "we are gorged with meaning and it is killing us."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Mapping the Subject: Geographies of Cultural Transformation|last=Pile|first=Steve|last2=Thrift|first2=Nigel|publisher=Routledge|year=1995|isbn=0415102251|location=London|pages=241}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hyperreality, some sources point out, may provide insights into the postmodern moment by analyzing how simulations disrupt the [[binary opposition]] between reality and [[illusion]] but  it does not address or resolve the contradictions inherent in this tension.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Postmodernism, Page 2|last=Taylor|first=Victor|last2=Winquist|first2=Charles|publisher=Routledge|year=2001|isbn=0415152941|location=London|pages=183}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Key relational themes==
Simulation/Simulacra: 
The concepts most fundamental to hyperreality are those of simulation and the simulacrum, first conceptualized by [[Jean Baudrillard]] in his book ''[[Simulacra and Simulation]]''.  The two terms are separate entities with relational origin connections to Baudrillard's theory of hyperreality.

===Simulation===
[[Simulation]] is characterized by a blending of 'reality' and representation, where there is no clear indication of where the former stops and the latter begins. Simulation is no longer that of a territory, a referential being, or a substance; "It is the generation by models of a real without origin or reality: a hyperreal."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Baudrillard|first=Jean|title=Simulacra &amp; Simulation|year=1994|publisher=University of Michigan Press|location=The Precession of Simulacra|page=1|url=https://www9.georgetown.edu/faculty/irvinem/theory/baudrillard-simulacra_and_simulation.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Baudrillard suggests that simulation no longer takes place in a physical realm; it takes place within a space not categorized by physical limits i.e., within ourselves, technological simulations, etc.

===Simulacrum===
The [[simulacrum]] is often defined as a copy with no original, or as [[Gilles Deleuze]] (1990) describes it, "the simulacrum is an image without resemblance". &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Boundas|first=Gilles Deleuze ; translated by Mark Lester with Charles Stivale ; edited by Constantin V.|title=The logic of sense|year=1990|publisher=Columbia University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0231059831|page=295}}&lt;/ref&gt; Baudrillard argues that a simulacrum is not a copy of the real, but becomes truth in its own right. He created four steps of reproduction: (1) basic reflection of reality, (2) perversion of reality; (3) pretense of reality (where there is no model); and (4) simulacrum, which "bears no relation to any reality whatsoever".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mann|first=Doug|title=Jean Baudrillard|url=http://publish.uwo.ca/~dmann/baudrillard1.htm|work=A Very Short Introduction|accessdate=16 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Quotations ==
"Henceforth, it is the map that precedes the territory—precession of simulacra—it is the map that engenders the territory and if we were to revive the fable today, it would be the territory whose shreds are slowly rotting across the map." — Jean Baudrillard, "The Precession of Simulacra," ''Simulacra and Simulation''

== Examples ==

=== Disneyland ===
Both [[Umberto Eco]] and [[Jean Baudrillard]] refer to [[Disneyland]] as an example of hyperreality. Eco believes that Disneyland with its settings such as Main Street and full sized houses has been created to look "absolutely realistic", taking visitors' imagination to a "fantastic past".&lt;ref&gt;Umberto Eco, ''Travels In Hyperreality'', New York, Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, 1986, p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt; This false reality creates an illusion and makes it more desirable for people to buy this reality. Disneyland works in a system that enables visitors to feel that technology and the created atmosphere "can give us more reality than nature can".&lt;ref&gt;Eco, ''Travels In Hyperreality'', p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt; The "fake nature" of Disneyland satisfies our imagination and daydream fantasies in real life.The idea is that nothing in this world is real. Nothing is original, but all are endless copies of reality. Since we do not imagine the reality of simulations, both imagined and real are equally hyperreal, for example, the numerous simulated rides, including the submarine ride and the Mississippi boat tour.&lt;ref name="Laughey, D. 2010"/&gt; When entering Disneyland, consumers form into lines to gain access to each attraction. Then they are ordered by people with special uniforms to follow the rules, such as where to stand or where to sit. If the consumers follow each rule correctly, they can enjoy "the real thing" and see things that are not available to them outside of Disneyland's doors.&lt;ref&gt;Eco, ''Travels In Hyperreality'', p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his work ''[[Simulacra and Simulation]]'', Baudrillard argues the "imaginary world" of Disneyland magnetizes people inside and has been presented as "imaginary" to make people believe that all its surroundings are "real". But he believes that the Los Angeles area is not real; thus it is hyperreal. Disneyland is a set of apparatuses which tries to bring imagination and fiction to what is called "real". This concerns the American values and way of life in a sense and "concealing the fact that the real is no longer real, and thus of saving the reality principle."&lt;ref&gt;Jean Baudrillard, "Simulacra and Simulations," in ''Selected Writings'', Mark Poster, ed. Stanford: Stanford University Press, 1988, pp. 166-184.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"The Disneyland imaginary is neither true or false: it is a deterrence machine set up in order to rejuvenate in reverse the fiction of the real. Whence the debility, the infantile degeneration of this imaginary. It's meant to be an infantile world, in order to make us believe that the adults are elsewhere, in the "real" world, and to conceal the fact that real childishness is everywhere, particularly among those adults who go there to act the child in order to foster illusions of their real childishness."&lt;ref&gt;Baudrillard, "Simulacra and Simulations," pp. 166-184&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Isvarakrsna''' ([[Sanskrit]]: ईश्वर कृष्णः {{zh|c=自在黑|p=Zìzàihēi}}) (5th century AD) is the author of the [[Samkhyakarika]], an early account of the universe and its components ([[Tattva|tattvas]]) according to the [[Samkhya]] school. Samkhya is one of the oldest of the six traditional systems of Indian philosophy which is attributed to the sage [[Kapila]], but may have originated in the non-vedic [[Śramaṇa]] tradition.

Samkhya philosophy is said to have inspired [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]], and versions of the Samkhya system are still used in many schools of Buddhism. Samkhya is also the basis for the [[Yoga (philosophy)|Yoga]] school. Different versions of this system are also used in [[Vaisnavism]] and [[Saivism]].

Stories of him as a fighter and [[frontier]]sman, both real and fictitious, have made him a legendary figure in [[History of Texas|Texas history]] and a [[folk hero]] of American culture.

Born in [[Kentucky]], Bowie spent most of his life in [[Louisiana]], where he was raised and where he later worked as a land speculator. His rise to fame began in 1827 on reports of the [[Sandbar Fight]]. What began as a duel between two other men deteriorated into a mêlée in which Bowie, having been shot and stabbed, killed the sheriff of [[Rapides Parish]] with a large knife. This, and other stories of Bowie's prowess with a knife, led to the widespread popularity of the [[Bowie knife]].

Bowie's reputation was cemented by his role in the [[Texas Revolution]].  After moving to Texas in 1830, Bowie became a Mexican citizen and married Ursula Veramendi, the daughter of the Mexican vice governor of the province. His fame in Texas grew following his failed expedition to find the lost [[San Saba County, Texas|San Saba]] mine, during which his small party repelled an attack by a large Indian raiding party. At the outbreak of the Texas Revolution, Bowie joined the Texas militia, leading forces at the [[Battle of Concepción]] and the [[Grass Fight]]. In January 1836, he arrived at the Alamo, where he commanded the volunteer forces until an illness left him bedridden. Bowie died with the other [[Alamo defenders]] on March 6. Despite conflicting accounts of the manner of his death, the "most popular, and probably the most accurate"&lt;ref name="Chariton74"/&gt; accounts maintain that he died in his bed after emptying his pistols into several Mexican soldiers.

==Early years==
According to his older brother John, James Bowie was born in [[Logan County, Kentucky]], on March 10, 1796 (Historical marker: 36° 46' 25"N 86° 42' 10"W).&lt;ref&gt;John Jones Bowie, "Early Life in the Southwest—the Bowies," ''DeBows Review'', October 1852&lt;/ref&gt; Historian Raymond Thorp gave his birth date as April 10, but Thorp did not provide any documentation for that date.&lt;ref&gt;Raymond Thorp, ''Bowie Knife'', New Mexico Press, 1948, p. 119&lt;/ref&gt; Bowie's surname was pronounced {{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|uː|i}} {{respell|BOO|ee}}.&lt;ref name="Evans 6"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Davis 1998 35"/&gt;&lt;ref name="The Bowie Knife"/&gt;  (Although some works refer to the alternate pronunciation {{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|oʊ|i}} {{respell|BOH|ee}}.)&lt;ref&gt;The Columbia Encyclopedia, 6th ed., 2013, entry "Bowie, James" with pronunciation guide "bō´ē" and key "ō toe" and "ē bee"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language, entry "Bowie, James", with pronunciation guide "bō´ē" and key "ō toe" and "ē bee"&lt;/ref&gt;

Bowie was the ninth of ten children born to Reason (or Rezin) and Elve Ap-Catesby Jones (or Johns) Bowie&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Williamson|first1=William|title=Handbook of Texas Online|date=June 12, 2010|publisher=Texas State Historical Association}}&lt;/ref&gt;. His father had been wounded while fighting in the [[American Revolutionary War]], and in 1782 married the young woman who had nursed him back to health. The Bowies first settled in [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] and then moved to [[Kentucky]]. At the time of Bowie's birth, his father owned eight [[history of slavery in Kentucky|slaves]], eleven head of cattle, seven horses, and one stud horse. The following year the family acquired {{convert|200|acre|ha|-1}} along the [[Red River (Kentucky River)|Red River]]. They sold that property in 1800 and relocated to [[Illinois Country|what is now Missouri]], before moving to [[Spanish Louisiana]] in 1802, where they settled on Bushley Bayou in what soon became [[Rapides Parish, Louisiana|Rapides Parish]].&lt;ref&gt;Hopewell (1994), pp.&amp;nbsp;2–3.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=groneman2p19&gt;Groneman (1990), p.&amp;nbsp;19.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Edmondson (2000), p.&amp;nbsp;86.&lt;/ref&gt;

The family moved again in 1809, settling on [[Bayou Teche]] in [[Territory of Orleans|Louisiana]] before finding a permanent home in [[Opelousas, Louisiana|Opelousas]] in 1812.&lt;ref name=hopewell4&gt;Hopewell (1994), p.&amp;nbsp;4.&lt;/ref&gt; The Bowie children were raised on the frontier and even as small children were expected to help clear the land and plant crops. All the children learned to read and write in English, but James and his elder brother [[Rezin Bowie|Rezin]] could also read, write, and speak [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and [[French language|French]] fluently.&lt;ref&gt;Hopewell (1994), pp.&amp;nbsp;5–6.&lt;/ref&gt; The children learned to survive on the frontier and how to fish and run a farm and plantation. James Bowie became proficient with pistol, rifle, and knife,&lt;ref&gt;Hopewell (1994), p.&amp;nbsp;7.&lt;/ref&gt; and had a reputation for fearlessness. When he was a boy, one of his Indian friends even taught him to rope alligators.&lt;ref&gt;Hopewell (1994), p.&amp;nbsp;8.&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to [[Andrew Jackson]]'s plea for volunteers to fight the British in the [[War of 1812]], James and Rezin enlisted in the Louisiana militia in late 1814. The Bowie brothers arrived in [[New Orleans]] too late to participate in the fighting.&lt;ref&gt;Edmondson (2000), p.&amp;nbsp;88.&lt;/ref&gt; After mustering out of the militia, Bowie settled in Rapides Parish,&lt;ref name=groneman2p19/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hopewell (1994), p.&amp;nbsp;10.&lt;/ref&gt; where he supported himself by sawing planks and lumber and floating them down the bayou for sale.&lt;ref name=groneman2p19/&gt;&lt;ref name=hopewell11/&gt; In June 1819, he joined the [[Long Expedition]], an effort to liberate [[Spanish Texas|Texas]] from Spanish rule.&lt;ref&gt;Hopewell (1994), p.&amp;nbsp;21.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nofi39/&gt; The group encountered little resistance and, after capturing [[Nacogdoches, Texas|Nacogdoches]], declared Texas an independent republic. The extent of Bowie's participation is unclear, but he returned to Louisiana before the invasion was repelled by Spanish troops.&lt;ref name=hopewell22&gt;Hopewell (1994), p.&amp;nbsp;22.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=edmondson89&gt;Edmondson (2000), p.&amp;nbsp;89.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Land speculator==
Shortly before the senior Bowie died circa 1820, he gave ten slaves as well as horses and cattle to both James and Rezin. For the next seven years, the brothers worked together to develop several large estates in [[Lafourche Parish]] and Opelousas.&lt;ref name=hopewell11/&gt; Louisiana's population was growing rapidly, and the brothers hoped to take advantage of its rising land prices through [[speculation]]. Without the capital required to buy large tracts,&lt;ref&gt;Hopewell (1994), p.&amp;nbsp;18.&lt;/ref&gt; they entered into a partnership with pirate [[Jean Lafitte]] in 1818 to raise money. By then, the United States had [[Slavery in the United States|outlawed the importation of slaves]], and most southern states allowed anyone who informed on a slave trader to receive half of what the imported slaves would earn at auction as a reward. Bowie made three trips to Lafitte's compound on [[Galveston Island]]. On each occasion, he bought smuggled slaves and took them directly to a customhouse to inform on his own actions. When the customs officers offered the slaves for auction, Bowie purchased them and received back half the price he had paid, as allowed by the state laws. He then could legally transport the slaves and resell them at a greater market value in [[New Orleans]] or areas farther up the [[Mississippi River]].&lt;ref&gt;Hopewell (1994), p.&amp;nbsp;19.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=edmondson91&gt;Edmondson (2000), p.&amp;nbsp;91.&lt;/ref&gt; Using this scheme, the brothers collected $65,000 to be used for their land speculation.&lt;ref name=edmondson91/&gt;&lt;ref name="1889history"&gt;Peatfield ''et al.'' (1889), p.&amp;nbsp;175.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1825, the two brothers joined with their younger brother Stephen to buy [[Acadia Plantation]] near [[Thibodaux, Louisiana|Thibodaux]]. Within two years, they had established the first steam mill in Louisiana to be used for grinding [[sugar cane]].&lt;ref name=groneman2p19/&gt;&lt;ref name=hopewell11/&gt;&lt;ref name=handbook/&gt; The plantation became known as a model estate, but on February 12, 1831, they sold it and 65&amp;nbsp;slaves for $90,000. With their profits, James and Rezin bought a plantation in [[Arkansas]].&lt;ref name=hopewell11&gt;Hopewell (1994), p.&amp;nbsp;11.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bowie and his brother John were involved in a major court case in the late 1820s over land speculation. When the United States purchased the [[Louisiana Territory]] in 1803, it promised to honor all former land grant claims, and for the next 20&amp;nbsp;years efforts were made to establish who owned what land. In May 1824, [[U.S. Congress|Congress]] authorized the [[superior Court|superior courts]] of each territory to hear suits from those who claimed they had been overlooked. The Arkansas Superior Court received 126&amp;nbsp;claims in late 1827 from residents who claimed to have purchased land in former Spanish grants from the Bowie brothers. Although the Superior Court originally confirmed most of those claims, the decisions were reversed in February 1831 after further research showed that the land had never belonged to the Bowies and that the original land grant documentation had been forged. The [[U.S. Supreme Court]] upheld the reversal in 1833.&lt;ref&gt;Hopewell (1994), pp.&amp;nbsp;23–24.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sears (2000), pp.&amp;nbsp;179–80.&lt;/ref&gt; When the disgruntled purchasers considered suing the Bowies, they discovered that the documents in the case had been removed from the court; left without evidence, they declined to pursue a case.&lt;ref&gt;Sears (2000), p.&amp;nbsp;186.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bowie knife==
{{Main|Bowie knife|Sandbar Fight}}
Bowie became internationally famous as a result of a feud with [[Norris Wright (sheriff)|Norris Wright]], the sheriff of Rapides Parish. Bowie had supported Wright's opponent in the race for sheriff, and Wright, a bank director, had been instrumental in turning down a Bowie loan application.&lt;ref&gt;Hopewell (1994), pp.&amp;nbsp;25–26.&lt;/ref&gt; After a confrontation in Alexandria one afternoon, Wright fired a shot at Bowie, after which Bowie resolved to carry his hunting knife at all times.&lt;ref&gt;Edmondson (2000), pp.&amp;nbsp;84–85.&lt;/ref&gt; The knife he carried had a blade that was {{convert|9.25|in|cm|}} long and {{convert|1.5|in|cm}} wide.&lt;ref name="kennedy"/&gt;

[[File:Bowie knife 1.jpg|thumb|right|300px|A [[Bowie knife]]]]
The following year, on September 19, 1827, Bowie and Wright attended a duel on a sandbar outside of [[Natchez, Mississippi]]. Bowie supported duellist Samuel Levi Wells III, while Wright supported Wells's opponent, Dr. Thomas Harris Maddox. The duellists each fired two shots and, as neither man had been injured, resolved their duel with a handshake.&lt;ref&gt;Hopewell (1994), pp.&amp;nbsp;28, 30.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Edmondson (2000), pp.&amp;nbsp;97–98.&lt;/ref&gt; Other members of the groups, who had various reasons for disliking each other, began fighting. Bowie was shot in the hip; after regaining his feet he drew a knife, described as a [[butcher knife]], and charged his attacker, who hit Bowie over the head with his empty pistol, breaking the pistol and knocking Bowie to the ground. Wright shot at and missed the prone Bowie, who returned fire and possibly hit Wright. Wright then drew his [[Swordstick|sword cane]] and impaled Bowie. When Wright attempted to retrieve his blade by placing his foot on Bowie's chest and tugging, Bowie pulled him down and disemboweled Wright with his large knife.&lt;ref&gt;Hopewell (1994), p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Edmondson (2000), pp.&amp;nbsp;99–101.&lt;/ref&gt; Wright died instantly, and Bowie, with Wright's sword still protruding from his chest, was shot again and stabbed by another member of the group. The doctors who had been present for the duel removed the bullets and patched Bowie's other wounds.&lt;ref&gt;Hopewell (1994), p.&amp;nbsp;32.&lt;/ref&gt;

Newspapers picked up the story, which became known as the [[Sandbar Fight]], and described in detail Bowie's fighting prowess and his unusual knife. Witness accounts agreed that Bowie did not attack first, and the others had focused their attack on Bowie because "they considered him the most dangerous man among their opposition."&lt;ref&gt;Hopewell (1994), pp.&amp;nbsp;33–34.&lt;/ref&gt; The incident cemented Bowie's reputation across the South as a superb knife fighter.&lt;ref name="handbook"/&gt;

There is disagreement among scholars as to whether the knife used in this fight was the same as what is now known as a [[Bowie knife]], also called an [[Arkansas toothpick]]. Multiple accounts exist of who designed and fabricated the first Bowie knife. Some claim that Bowie designed it, while others attribute the design to noted knife makers of the time.&lt;ref&gt;Hopewell (1994), pp.&amp;nbsp;35–36.&lt;/ref&gt; In a letter to ''The Planter's Advocate'', Rezin Bowie claimed to have invented the knife,&lt;ref&gt;Hopewell (1994), p.&amp;nbsp;41.&lt;/ref&gt; however, and many Bowie family members as well, as "most authorities on the Bowie knife tend to believe it was invented by" Rezin.&lt;ref&gt;Hopewell (1994), pp.&amp;nbsp;37, 39.&lt;/ref&gt; Rezin Bowie's grandchildren, however, claimed that Rezin merely supervised his blacksmith, who was the creator of the knife.&lt;ref&gt;Edmondson (2000), p.&amp;nbsp;123&lt;/ref&gt;

After the Sandbar Fight and subsequent battles in which Bowie used his knife to defend himself, the Bowie knife became very popular. Many craftsmen and manufacturers made their own versions, and major cities of the [[Old Southwest]] had "Bowie knife schools" that taught "the art of cut, thrust, and parry."&lt;ref&gt;Hopewell (1994), p.&amp;nbsp;55.&lt;/ref&gt; His fame, and that of his knife, spread to England, and by the early 1830s many British manufacturers were producing Bowie knives for shipment to the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Hopewell (1994), p.&amp;nbsp;56.  Edmondson (2000), p.&amp;nbsp;122.&lt;/ref&gt; The design of the knife continued to evolve, but today a Bowie knife generally is considered to have a blade {{convert|8.25|in|cm}} long and {{convert|1.25|in|cm}} wide, with a curved point, a "sharp false edge cut from both sides", and a cross-guard to protect the user's hands.&lt;ref&gt;Hopewell (1994), pp.&amp;nbsp;40,&amp;nbsp;42.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Establishment in Texas==
In 1828, after recovering from wounds suffered in the Sandbar Fight, Bowie decided to move to [[Coahuila y Texas]], at that time a state in the Mexican federation.&lt;ref&gt;Hopewell (1994), p.&amp;nbsp;60.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[1824 Constitution of Mexico]] banned religions other than [[Roman Catholicism]] and gave preference to Mexican citizens in receiving land.&lt;ref&gt;Hopewell (1994), p.&amp;nbsp;61.&lt;/ref&gt; Bowie was baptized into the [[Roman Catholic]] faith in San Antonio on April 28, 1828, sponsored by the [[alcalde]] (chief administrator) of the town, [[Juan Martín de Veramendi]], and the wife of the administrator, Josefa Navarro.&lt;ref&gt;Sears (2000), p.&amp;nbsp;175.&lt;/ref&gt; For the next 18&amp;nbsp;months, Bowie traveled through Louisiana and Mississippi. In 1829, he became engaged to Cecilia Wells, who died in [[Alexandria, Louisiana|Alexandria]], on September 29, two weeks before they were to be married.&lt;ref name="handbook"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Edmondson (2000), p.&amp;nbsp;102.&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 1, 1830, Bowie left Louisiana for permanent residency in Texas. He stopped at Nacogdoches, at Jared E. Groce's farm on the [[Brazos River]], and in San Felipe, where Bowie presented a letter of introduction to [[Stephen F. Austin]] from Thomas&amp;nbsp;F. McKinney, one of the [[Old Three Hundred]] colonists. On February 20, Bowie took an oath of allegiance to [[Mexico]] and then proceeded to [[San Antonio, Texas|San Antonio de Bexar]].&lt;ref name="handbook"/&gt; At the time, the city was known as Bexar and had a population of 2500, mostly of Mexican descent, and Bowie's fluency in Spanish helped him establish himself in the area.&lt;ref&gt;Hopewell (1994), p.&amp;nbsp;64.&lt;/ref&gt; Bowie was elected a commander, with the rank of colonel, of the [[Texas Ranger Division|Texas Rangers]] later that year.&lt;ref name=groneman18&gt;Groneman (1990), p.&amp;nbsp;18.&lt;/ref&gt; Although the Rangers would not be organized officially until 1835, [[Stephen&amp;nbsp;F. Austin]] had founded the group by employing 30&amp;nbsp;men to keep the peace and protect the colonists from attacks by hostile [[Native Americans in the United States|Indians]]. Other areas assembled similar volunteer militias, and Bowie commanded a group of the volunteers.&lt;ref name="hopewell65"/&gt;

Bowie renounced his American citizenship and became a Mexican citizen on September 30, 1830, after promising to establish textile mills in the state of [[Coahuila y Tejas]].&lt;ref name=hopewell65&gt;Hopewell (1994), p.&amp;nbsp;65.&lt;/ref&gt; To fulfill his promise, Bowie entered into partnership with Veramendi to build cotton and wool mills in [[Saltillo]].&lt;ref name=hopewell66&gt;Hopewell (1994), p.&amp;nbsp;66.&lt;/ref&gt; With his citizenship assured, Bowie now had the right to buy up to 11&amp;nbsp;[[League (unit)#Spain|leagues]] of public land. He convinced 14 or 15 other citizens to apply for land in order to turn it over to him, giving him 700,000&amp;nbsp;acres (280,000&amp;nbsp;ha) for speculation. Bowie may have been the first to induce settlers to apply for empresario grants, which could then be sold in bulk to speculators as Bowie had.&lt;ref name=hopewell66/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Edmondson (2000), p.&amp;nbsp;106.&lt;/ref&gt; The Mexican government passed laws in 1834 and 1835 that stopped much of the land speculation.&lt;ref name=hopewell67&gt;Hopewell (1994), p.&amp;nbsp;67.&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 25, 1831, Bowie married nineteen-year-old Maria Ursula de Veramendi, the daughter of his business partner, who had become the vice governor of the province. Several days before the ceremony, he signed a dowry contract promising to pay his new bride 15,000&amp;nbsp;pesos (approximately $15,000 then, or ${{Formatnum:{{Inflation|US|15000|1831|r=-3}}|0}} today{{Inflation-fn|US}}) in cash or property within two years of the marriage. At the time, Bowie claimed to have a [[net worth]] of $223,000 (${{Formatnum:{{Inflation|US|223000|1831|r=-4}}|0}} today), mostly in land of questionable title. Bowie also lied about his age, claiming to be 30 rather than 35.&lt;ref&gt;Hopewell (1994), pp. 69–70. Spears (2000), p.&amp;nbsp;184.&lt;/ref&gt; The couple built a house in San Antonio on land Veramendi had given them near the [[San Antonio Missions National Historical Park#Mission San José|San José Mission]]. After a short time, however, they moved into the Veramendi Palace, living with Ursula's parents, who supplied them with spending money.&lt;ref&gt;Hopewell (1994), p. 71. Edmondson (2000), p.&amp;nbsp;107.&lt;/ref&gt; The couple had two children, Marie Elve (b. March&amp;nbsp;20, 1832) and James Veramendi (b. July&amp;nbsp;18, 1833).&lt;ref name=hopewell72&gt;Hopewell (1994), p.&amp;nbsp;72.&lt;/ref&gt;

Maria Ursula, her parents, and both children died in September 1833 from [[cholera]].&lt;ref name="handbook"/&gt;

[[File:1833 Rezin Bowie - An Indian battle - The casket.pdf|thumb|right|Rezin Bowie's account of an Indian fight in Texas in 1831 [with 1833 woodcut illustration]]]

==Los Almagres Mine==
[[File:1833 woodcut of Indian fight from Casket &amp; Saturday Evening Post.png|thumb|left|Woodcut illustrating Rezin Bowie's 1833 account of an 1831 Indian fight in Texas appearing in the Saturday Evening Post and Atkinson's Casket]]

Shortly after his marriage Bowie became fascinated with the story of the "[[Lost mines|lost]]" Los Almagres Mine (also known as the lost San Saba Mine and the lost Bowie Mine), said to be northwest of San Antonio near the ruin of the [[Mission Santa Cruz de San Sabá|Spanish Mission Santa Cruz de San Saba]].&lt;ref name=kennedy&gt;Kennedy (1841), pp.&amp;nbsp;122–128.&lt;/ref&gt; According to legend, the mine had been operated by local Indians before being seized by the Spanish. After [[Mexican War of Independence|Mexico won independence from Spain]], government interest in the mining potential waned. A number of native groups roamed the area, including [[Comanche]], [[Lipan Apache people|Lipan Apache]], [[Tawakoni]], and [[Tonkawa]]. Without government troops to keep hostile natives at bay, mining and mineral exploration were impossible. Some believed that after the Mexican citizens left the area, the Lipan took over the mine.&lt;ref name=hopewell72/&gt;

After obtaining permission from the Mexican government to mount an expedition into Indian territory to search for the legendary silver mine, Bowie, his brother Rezin, and ten others set out for San Saba on November 2, 1831. Six miles (10&amp;nbsp;km) from their goal, the group stopped to negotiate with a large raiding party of Indians—reportedly more than 120 Tawakoni and [[Waco people|Waco]], plus another 40 [[Caddo]]. The attempts at parley failed and Bowie and his group fought for their lives for the next 13&amp;nbsp;hours. When the Indians finally retreated, Bowie reportedly had lost only one man, while more than 40&amp;nbsp;Indians had been killed and 30 were wounded.&lt;ref name="1889history"/&gt;&lt;ref name=kennedy/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Edmondson (2000), p.&amp;nbsp;109.&lt;/ref&gt; In the meantime, a party of friendly Comanche rode into San Antonio bringing word of the raiding party, which outnumbered the Bowie expedition by 14 to 1. The citizens of San Antonio believed the members of the Bowie expedition must have perished, and Ursula Bowie began wearing [[Mourning#United Kingdom|widow's weeds]].&lt;ref name=edmondson116&gt;Edmondson (2000), p. 116.&lt;/ref&gt;

To the surprise of the town, the surviving members of the group returned to San Antonio on December 6.&lt;ref name=edmondson116/&gt; Bowie's report of the expedition, written in Spanish, was printed in several newspapers, further establishing his reputation.&lt;ref name=Hopewell75&gt;Hopewell (1994), p.&amp;nbsp;75.&lt;/ref&gt; He set out again with a larger force the following month, but returned home empty-handed after two and a half months of searching.&lt;ref name="handbook"/&gt;

Bowie never talked of his exploits despite his increasing fame.&lt;ref&gt;Hopewell (1994), p.&amp;nbsp;77.&lt;/ref&gt; Captain William&amp;nbsp;Y. Lacey, who spent eight months living in the wilderness with Bowie, described him as a humble man who never used profanity or vulgarities.&lt;ref name=hopewell78&gt;Hopewell (1994), p.&amp;nbsp;78.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Texas Revolution==

===Texan rumblings===
Between 1830 and 1832 the Mexican Congress passed a series of laws that seemed to discriminate against Anglo colonists in the province of Coahuila y Tejas, increasing tension between the Anglo citizenry and Mexican officials. In response to the rumblings, Mexican troops established military posts in several locations within the province, including San Antonio de Béxar.&lt;ref name=hopewell92&gt;Hopewell (1994), p.&amp;nbsp;92.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=edmondson135&gt;Edmondson (2000), p. 135.&lt;/ref&gt; Although much of the military supported the administration of President [[Anastasio Bustamante]], [[Antonio López de Santa Anna]] led an insurrection against him in 1832.&lt;ref name=vazquez65&gt;Vazquez (1997), p.&amp;nbsp;65.&lt;/ref&gt; Anglo colonists in Texas supported Santa Anna and General [[José Antonio Mexía]], who led soldiers into Texas to oust commanders loyal to Bustamante.&lt;ref name=vazquez66&gt;Vazquez (1997), p. 66.&lt;/ref&gt;

After hearing that the Mexican army commander in Nacogdoches, José de las Piedras, had demanded that all residents in his area surrender their arms, Bowie cut short a visit to Natchez in July 1832 to return to Texas.&lt;ref name="handbook"/&gt; On August 2, 1832, he joined a group of other Texans and marched into Nacogdoches to "present their demands" to Piedras.&lt;ref name=hopewell92/&gt; Before the group reached the building housing the town officials, they were attacked by a force of 100&amp;nbsp;Mexican cavalry. The [[Texas|Texans]] returned fire and the [[Battle of Nacogdoches]] began. After the cavalry retreated, they initiated a siege of the garrison.&lt;ref name=hopewell92/&gt; After a second battle, in which Piedras lost 33&amp;nbsp;men, the Mexican army evacuated during the night. Bowie and 18&amp;nbsp;companions ambushed the fleeing army and, after Piedras fled, marched the soldiers back to Nacogdoches.&lt;ref name="handbook"/&gt; Bowie later served as a delegate to the [[Convention of 1833]], which formally requested that Texas become its own state within the Mexican federation.&lt;ref name=hopewell93&gt;Hopewell (1994), p.&amp;nbsp;93.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Santaanna1.JPG|thumb|right|[[Antonio López de Santa Anna]], president of Mexico, led the Mexican Army into Texas.]]

Several months later, a [[cholera]] epidemic struck Texas. Fearing the disease would reach San Antonio, Bowie sent his pregnant wife and their daughter to the family estate in [[Monclova]] in the company of her parents and brother. The cholera epidemic instead struck Monclova, and between September 6 and September 14, Ursula, their children, her brother, and her parents all died of the disease. Bowie, on business in Natchez, heard of his family's deaths in November. From then on, he drank heavily and became "careless in his dress."&lt;ref name=hopewell93/&gt;

The following year, the Mexican government passed new laws allowing land sale in Texas, and Bowie returned to land speculation. He was appointed a land commissioner and tasked with promoting settlement in the area purchased by John T. Mason. His appointment ended in May 1835 when President [[Antonio López de Santa Anna]] abolished the Coahuila y Tejas government and ordered the arrest of all Texans (including Bowie) doing business in Monclova. Bowie was forced to flee Monclova and return to the Anglo areas of Texas.&lt;ref name="handbook"/&gt;

The Anglos in Texas began agitating for war against Santa Anna, and Bowie worked with [[William B. Travis]], the leader of the War Party, to gain support. Bowie visited several Indian villages in East Texas in an attempt to persuade the reluctant tribes to fight against the Mexican government. Santa Anna responded to the rumblings by ordering large numbers of Mexican troops to Texas.&lt;ref name="handbook"/&gt;

===Battle of Concepción===
The [[Texas Revolution]] began on October&amp;nbsp;2, 1835, with the [[Battle of Gonzales]]. [[Stephen&amp;nbsp;F. Austin]] formed an army of 500&amp;nbsp;men to march on the Mexican forces in San Antonio with the [[Come and take it|cannon that had precipitated the fight]]. The name "[[Texian Army]]" sometimes is applied to this militia. On October 22, Austin asked Bowie, now a colonel in the volunteer militia, and [[James W. Fannin]] to scout the area around the missions of [[Mission San Francisco de la Espada|San Francisco de la Espada]] and [[Mission San José y San Miguel de Aguayo|San José y San Miguel de Aguayo]] to find supplies for the volunteer forces.&lt;ref&gt;Hopewell (1994), p.&amp;nbsp;100.&lt;/ref&gt; The scouting party left with 92&amp;nbsp;men, many of them members of the New Orleans Grays who had just arrived in Texas. After discovering a good defensive position near [[Mission Nuestra Señora de la Purísima Concepción de Acuña|Mission Concepción]], the group requested that Austin's army join them.&lt;ref&gt;Hopewell (1994), p.&amp;nbsp;101.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the foggy morning of October 28, Mexican General [[Domingo Ugartechea]] led a force of 300&amp;nbsp;infantry and cavalry soldiers and two small cannons against the Texian forces.&lt;ref name=hopewell102/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Edmondson (2000), p.&amp;nbsp;221.&lt;/ref&gt; Although the Mexican army was able to get within 200&amp;nbsp;yards (183&amp;nbsp;m), the Texian defensive position protected them from fire. As the Mexicans stopped to reload their cannon, the Texians climbed a bluff and picked off some of the soldiers. The stalemate ended shortly after Bowie led a charge to seize one of the Mexican cannons, at that time only 80&amp;nbsp;yards (73&amp;nbsp;m) away. Ugartechea retreated with his troops, ending the [[Battle of Concepción]]. One Texian and ten Mexican troops had been killed.&lt;ref name=hopewell102&gt;Hopewell (1994), p.&amp;nbsp;102.&lt;/ref&gt; One of the men under Bowie's command during the battle later praised him "as a born leader, never needlessly spending a bullet or imperiling a life, who repeatedly admonished... Keep under cover boys, and reserve your fire; we haven't a man to spare."&lt;ref name=edmondson223&gt;Edmondson (2000), p.&amp;nbsp;223.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Grass Fight and commission difficulties===
An hour after the battle ended, Austin arrived with the rest of the Texian army to begin a [[siege of Béxar|siege of San Antonio de Béxar]], where General [[Martín Perfecto de Cós]], the overall commander of Mexican forces in Texas, and his troops were garrisoned.&lt;ref&gt;Hopewell (1994), pp.&amp;nbsp;103–104.&lt;/ref&gt; Two&amp;nbsp;days later, Bowie resigned from Austin's army because he did not have an official commission in the army, and he disliked the "minor tasks of scouting and spying".&lt;ref name=hopewell104&gt;Hopewell (1994), p.&amp;nbsp;104.&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 3, 1835, Texas declared itself an independent state, and a provisional government was formed with [[Henry Smith (Texas Governor)|Henry Smith]] of [[Brazoria, Texas|Brazoria]] elected provisional governor. Austin requested to be relieved of his command of the army, and [[Sam Houston]] was named army chief. [[Edward Burleson]] was chosen as temporary commander of the troops in San Antonio. Bowie appeared before the council at some point and spoke for an hour, asking for a commission.&lt;ref&gt;Hopewell (1994), p.&amp;nbsp;106.&lt;/ref&gt; The council refused Bowie's request, likely because of lingering animosity over his land dealings.&lt;ref name=hopewell107/&gt;

Houston offered Bowie a commission as an officer on his staff, but Bowie rejected the opportunity, explaining that he wanted to be in the midst of the fighting.&lt;ref name=hopewell107&gt;Hopewell (1994), p.&amp;nbsp;107.&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, Bowie enlisted in the army as a private under Fannin.&lt;ref name="handbook"/&gt;&lt;ref name=hopewell104/&gt; He distinguished himself again in the [[Grass Fight]] on November 26. Cós had sent approximately 187&amp;nbsp;men to cut grass for his horses.&lt;ref name=jennings175&gt;Jennings (2000), p.&amp;nbsp;175.&lt;/ref&gt; As they returned to San Antonio, Bowie took 60&amp;nbsp;mounted men to intercept the party,&lt;ref name=nofi43&gt;Nofi (1992), p.&amp;nbsp;43.&lt;/ref&gt; which they believed carried valuable cargo.&lt;ref name=jennings175/&gt; The Mexican troops quickened their pace in the hopes of reaching the safety of the city, but Bowie and his cavalry chased them. At the end of the fight, the Texians had two wounded men, but had captured many horses and mules.&lt;ref name=nofi43/&gt;

Shortly after Bowie left San Antonio, [[Ben Milam]] led an assault on the city. In the ensuing fighting, the Texians suffered only a few casualties, while the Mexican army lost many troops to death and desertion. Cós surrendered and returned to Mexico, taking with him the last Mexican troops in Texas. Believing the war was over, many of the Texian volunteers left the army and returned to their families.&lt;ref&gt;Edmondson (2000), pp.&amp;nbsp; 244–245.&lt;/ref&gt; In early January 1836, Bowie went to San Felipe and asked the council to allow him to recruit a regiment. He again was turned down as he "was not an officer of the government nor army."&lt;ref&gt;Hopewell (1994), p.&amp;nbsp;111.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Battle of the Alamo===
{{Main|Battle of the Alamo}}

After Houston received word that Santa Anna was leading a large force to San Antonio, Bowie offered to lead volunteers to defend the [[Alamo Mission in San Antonio|Alamo]] from the expected attack. He arrived with 30&amp;nbsp;men on January 19,&lt;ref name=hopewell112&gt;Hopewell (1994), p.&amp;nbsp;112.&lt;/ref&gt; where they found a force of 104&amp;nbsp;men with a few weapons and a few cannons, but not many supplies and little gunpowder.&lt;ref&gt;Hopewell (1994), p.&amp;nbsp;113.&lt;/ref&gt; Houston knew that there were not enough men to hold the fort in an attack and had given Bowie authority to remove the artillery and blow up the fortification. Bowie and the Alamo commander, [[James C. Neill]], decided they did not have enough oxen to move the artillery, and they did not want to destroy the fortress. On January 26, one of Bowie's men, [[James Bonham]], organized a rally which passed a resolution in favor of holding the Alamo. Bonham signed the resolution first, with Bowie's signature second.&lt;ref name=hopewell114&gt;Hopewell (1994), p.&amp;nbsp;114.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Alamo1846.jpg|thumb|left|400px|The Alamo, circa 1846]]

Through Bowie's connections because of his marriage and his fluency in Spanish, the predominantly Mexican population of San Antonio often furnished him with information about the movements of the Mexican army. After learning that Santa Anna had 4,500&amp;nbsp;troops and was heading for the city,&lt;ref name=hopewell114/&gt; Bowie wrote several letters to the provisional government asking for help in defending the Alamo, especially "men, money, rifles, and cannon powder".&lt;ref name=hopewell115/&gt; In another letter, to Governor Smith, he reiterated his view that "the salvation of Texas depends in great measure on keeping Béxar out of the hands of the enemy. It serves as the frontier picquet guard, and if it were in the possession of Santa Anna, there is no stronghold from which to repel him in his march toward the Sabine."&lt;ref name=hopewell115/&gt; The letter to Smith ended, "Colonel Neill and myself have come to the solemn resolution that we will rather die in these ditches than give it up to the enemy."&lt;ref name=hopewell115/&gt;

On February 3, [[Davy Crockett]] appeared with thirty&amp;nbsp;Tennesseans. Neill went on furlough on February 11 to visit his sick family, leaving Travis, a member of the regular army, in command.&lt;ref name=chariton96&gt;Chariton (1992), p.&amp;nbsp;96.&lt;/ref&gt; Bowie was older than Travis with a better reputation and considered himself a colonel, thus outranking Travis, a lieutenant colonel.&lt;ref name=hopewell116/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Groneman (1990), p.&amp;nbsp;114.&lt;/ref&gt; He refused to answer to Travis, who called an election for the men to choose their own commander. They chose Bowie, infuriating Travis.&lt;ref name=hopewell116&gt;Hopewell (1994), p.&amp;nbsp;116.&lt;/ref&gt; Bowie celebrated his appointment by getting very drunk and causing havoc in San Antonio, releasing all prisoners in the local jails and harassing citizens. Travis was disgusted, but two&amp;nbsp;days later the men agreed to a joint command; Bowie would command the volunteers, and Travis would command the regular army and the volunteer cavalry.&lt;ref name="handbook"&gt;{{citation|title=James Bowie|publisher=[[Handbook of Texas]]|url=http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/fbo45|accessdate=2007-10-06|last=Williamson|first=William R.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=hopewell116/&gt;

On February 23, the bells of San Fernando sounded the alarm of the approach of the Mexicans. Travis ordered all the Texan forces into the Alamo.&lt;ref name=edmondson300&gt;Edmondson (2000), p.300.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hopewell (1994), p.&amp;nbsp;118.&lt;/ref&gt; Bowie hurried to gather provisions and herd cattle into the Alamo compound.&lt;ref name=edmondson321&gt;Edmondson (2000), p.321.&lt;/ref&gt;
Fearing for the safety of his wife's relatives in San Antonio, Bowie invited her cousins Getrudis Navarro and [[Juana Navarro Alsbury]], as well as Alsbury's 18-month-old son, Alijo Perez Jr., to stay inside the walls of the Alamo.&lt;ref&gt;Hopewell (1994), p. 119. Groneman (1996), pp.&amp;nbsp;72,&amp;nbsp;182.&lt;/ref&gt; Bowie also brought several black servants, some of whom worked at the Veramendi Palace, into the security of the Alamo fortress.&lt;ref&gt;Hopewell (1994), p. 119.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Lindley94&gt;Lindley (2003), p. 94.&lt;/ref&gt; Bowie had been ill, and two&amp;nbsp;doctors, including the fort surgeon, were unable to diagnose his illness.&lt;ref name=hopewell115&gt;Hopewell (1994), p.&amp;nbsp;115.&lt;/ref&gt; Travis became the sole commander of the forces when Bowie was confined to bed.&lt;ref name=hopewell117&gt;Hopewell (1994), p.&amp;nbsp;117.&lt;/ref&gt; Santa Anna and his army began a [[Battle of the Alamo|siege of the Alamo]] on February 24. The Mexican army raised a red flag to warn the defenders that [[no quarter]] would be given.&lt;ref&gt;Hopewell (1994), p.&amp;nbsp;121.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bowie and Travis began sending out couriers with pleas for provisions and assistance.&lt;ref&gt;Hopewell120 (1994), p.120.&lt;/ref&gt; Travis sent [[Juan Seguin]] on Bowie's horse, to recruit reinforcements on February 25, and {{nowrap|32 additional men}} arrived.&lt;ref&gt;Hopewell122 (1994), p.122.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=edmondson320&gt;Edmondson (2000), p.320.&lt;/ref&gt; On February 26, Crockett reported that Bowie, though suffering from his affliction, continued to crawl from his bed around noon every day and presented himself to the Alamo's inhabitants, which much boosted the morale of his comrades.&lt;ref&gt;Hopewell117 (1994), p.117.&lt;/ref&gt;
Thirty-five&amp;nbsp;years after the Alamo fell, a reporter identified [[Moses Rose|Louis "Moses" Rose]] as the only man to have "deserted" the [[Texian]] forces at the Alamo. According to the reporter's version of Rose's account, when Travis realized that the Mexican army would likely prevail, he drew a line in the sand and asked those willing to die for the cause to cross the line. At Bowie's request Crockett and several others carried the cot over the line, leaving Rose alone on the other side.&lt;ref name=hopewell126&gt;Hopewell (1994), p.&amp;nbsp;126.&lt;/ref&gt; After its publication, several other eyewitnesses confirmed the account,&lt;ref&gt;Groneman (1996), pp.&amp;nbsp;122,&amp;nbsp;150,&amp;nbsp;184.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=chariton195/&gt; but as Rose was deceased the story can only be authenticated by the word of the reporter, who admitted to embellishing other articles, "and thus many historians refuse to believe it."&lt;ref name=chariton195&gt;Chariton (1992), p.&amp;nbsp;195.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bowie perished with the rest of the Alamo defenders on March 6, when the Mexicans attacked.&lt;ref name="handbook"/&gt; Most of the noncombatants in the fort, including Bowie's relatives, survived.&lt;ref&gt;Edmondson (2000), p.&amp;nbsp;407.&lt;/ref&gt; Santa Anna ordered the [[alcalde]] of San Antonio, [[Francisco Antonio Ruiz]], to confirm the identities of Bowie, Travis, and Crockett.&lt;ref name=hopewell124&gt;Hopewell (1994), p.&amp;nbsp;124.&lt;/ref&gt; After first ordering that Bowie be buried, as he was too brave a man to be burned like a dog,&lt;ref&gt;Hopewell (1994), p.&amp;nbsp;80.&lt;/ref&gt; Santa Anna later had Bowie's body placed with those of the other Texians on the funeral pyre.&lt;ref name=hopewell124/&gt;

When Bowie's mother was informed of his death, she calmly stated, "I'll wager no wounds were found in his back."&lt;ref&gt;Hopewell (1994), p.&amp;nbsp;125.&lt;/ref&gt; Various eyewitnesses to the battle gave conflicting accounts of Bowie's death. A newspaper article claimed that a Mexican soldier saw Bowie carried from his room on his cot, alive, after the conclusion of the battle. The soldier maintained that Bowie verbally castigated a Mexican officer in fluent Spanish, and the officer ordered Bowie's tongue cut out and his still-breathing body thrown onto the funeral pyre. This account has been disputed by numerous other witnesses, and it is thought to have been invented by the reporter.&lt;ref&gt;Groneman (1996), pp.&amp;nbsp;83–87.&lt;/ref&gt; Other witnesses maintained that they saw several Mexican soldiers enter Bowie's room, bayonet him, and carry him, alive, from the room.&lt;ref&gt;Groneman (1996), p.&amp;nbsp;214.&lt;/ref&gt; Various other stories circulated, with some witnesses claiming that Bowie shot himself and others saying he was killed by soldiers while too weak to lift his head.&lt;ref name=hopewell127/&gt; Alcalde Ruiz said that Bowie was found "dead in his bed."&lt;ref name=hopewell127&gt;Hopewell (1994), p.&amp;nbsp;127.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Wallace O Chariton, the "most popular, and probably the most accurate"&lt;ref name="Chariton74"&gt;Chariton (1992), p.&amp;nbsp;74.&lt;/ref&gt; version is that Bowie died on his cot, "back braced against the wall, and using his pistols and his famous knife."&lt;ref name=hopewell127/&gt; One&amp;nbsp;year after the battle, Juan Seguin returned to the Alamo and gathered the remaining ashes from the funeral pyre. He placed these in a coffin inscribed with the names of Bowie, Travis, and Crockett. The ashes were interred at the [[Cathedral of San Fernando]].&lt;ref&gt;Hopewell (1994), p.&amp;nbsp;128.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
Despite his continual pronouncements of wealth, Bowie's estate was found to be very small. His possessions were auctioned for only $99.50.&lt;ref&gt;Hopewell (1994), pp.&amp;nbsp;128–129.&lt;/ref&gt; His larger legacy is his position as "one of the legendary characters of the American frontier."&lt;ref name=nofi39&gt;Nofi (1992), p.&amp;nbsp;39.&lt;/ref&gt; Bowie left a "frustratingly sparse paper trail" of his life, and for many "where history failed, the legends prevailed."&lt;ref name=edmondson119/&gt; Although Bowie's name and knife were well known during his lifetime, his legend grew after October 1852, when ''[[DeBow's Review]]'' published an article written by his brother John Jones Bowie called, "Early Life in the Southwest—The Bowies." The article focused primarily on the exploits of Jim Bowie.&lt;ref&gt;Edmondson (2000), p.&amp;nbsp;118.&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning with that article, "romanticized stories" about Bowie began appearing in national press.&lt;ref name=edmondson119&gt;Edmondson (2000), p.&amp;nbsp;119.&lt;/ref&gt; In many cases, "these stories were pure melodrama, with Bowie rescuing some naïve planter's son or damsel in distress."&lt;ref name=edmondson119/&gt;

Jim Bowie was inducted posthumously into the [[Blade (magazine)|''Blade Magazine'']] Cutlery Hall of Fame at the 1988 [[Blade Show]] in [[Atlanta, Georgia]], in recognition of the impact that his eponymous design made upon generations of knife makers and cutlery companies.&lt;ref name="HOF"&gt;{{Citation |title=Bowie Inducted into the Hall of Fame|work=Blade Magazine|date=1998-01-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of [[Legacy of the Battle of the Alamo#Film|films have depicted the events of the Battle of the Alamo]],&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Briley|first=Ron|title=Remember the Alamo:The Persistence of Myth|publisher=George Mason University History News Network|date=April 19, 2004|url=http://hnn.us/articles/4750.html|accessdate=2007-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Bowie has appeared as a character in each.

From 1956 to 1958, Bowie was the subject of a [[CBS]] [[television series]], ''[[The Adventures of Jim Bowie]]'', which was primarily set in 1830s Louisiana, although later episodes ventured into the Mexican province of Texas.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=The Adventures of Jim Bowie|publisher=Classic TV &amp; Movie Hits|url=http://www.classictvhits.com/show.php?id=397|accessdate=2007-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The show, which starred [[Scott Forbes]] as Jim Bowie, was based on the 1946 novel ''Tempered Blade''.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Adventures of Jim Bowie|publisher=FiftiesWeb.com|url=http://www.fiftiesweb.com/tv/jim-bowie.htm|accessdate=2007-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rock star [[David Bowie]], who was born David Robert Hayward-Jones, adopted the folk legend's surname. Jones changed his last name in the 1960s because he feared confusion with [[Davy Jones (actor)|Davy Jones]], a member of the already famous [[The Monkees]]. He chose the Bowie [[eponym]] because he admired James Bowie and the Bowie knife, although his pronunciation uses the {{respell|BOH|ee}} ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|oʊ|i}}) variant.&lt;ref&gt;Buckley (2000), p.&amp;nbsp;33.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bowie County, Texas|Bowie County]] in northeast Texas, and the city of [[Bowie, Texas|Bowie]] in [[Montague County, Texas|Montague County]], Texas, were both named in honor of James Bowie. James Bowie Elementary in [[Corsicana, Texas]] was also named in honor of James.

The '''Kirriemuir Sculptured Stones''' are a series of Class II and III [[Pictish stones]] found in [[Kirriemuir]], [[Angus, Scotland]]. Their existence points to Kirriemuir being an important ecclesiastical centre in the late first millennium AD.

==Location==
The stones were found in the grounds of Kirriemuir Kirk {{gbmapping|NO38955448}}. The stones are now on display at the [[Meffan Institute]] in [[Forfar]], [[Angus, Scotland|Angus]].

==Description==
===Kirriemuir 1===
The slab is carved on both faces in [[relief]] and, as it bears Pictish symbols, it falls into [[John Romilly Allen]] and Joseph Anderson's classification system as a class II stone.&lt;ref name=ECMS&gt;{{citation

[[File:Monumento de Pozo Moro (M.A.N. Inv.1999-76-A) 01.jpg|thumb|The Mausoleum of Pozo Moro in the [[Museo Arqueológico Nacional de España]] in [[Madrid]]]]
The '''Mausoleum of Pozo Moro''' is a [[Mausoleum]] of the [[Iberians]] from the end of the 6th century BC, which was discovered in 1970 in excavations made in the [[Province of Albacete]]. 

== Location ==
Pozo Moro, near the [[Spain|Spanish]] community of [[Chinchilla de Monte-Aragón]], lies about 840 m above sea level and 125 km from the Mediterranean coast at the intersection of important ancient roads. Here the road from Carthago Nova ([[Cartagena, Spain|Cartagena]]) to Complutum ([[Alcalá de Henares]]) and the central Spanish [[plateau]] met the ''Via Heraclea'' (also known as the [[Via Augusta]]), which ran down the [[Guadalquivir]] to Gades ([[Cádiz]]) and along the Spanish [[Levante, Spain|Levante]].

== Description ==
The Mausoleum was found in pieces in an Iberian [[necropolis]], strewn over a 12 x 12 m area and his since been reconstructed in the [[Museo Arqueológico Nacional de España]] in [[Madrid]]. The Mausoleum, which was erected by an Iberian king around 500 BC, is the oldest known Iberian grave monument. The find spots of the rectangular blocks enabled an accurate reconstruction of the structure, which must have been about 10 metres high and have stood atop a three-level square pedestal 3.65 m wide. Four stone lions stood on the corners of the mausoleum, whose walls were decorated with [[relief]]s depicting deities. These sculptures belong to the orientalising phase of [[Iberian sculpture|Iberian art]] and are heavily influenced by [[Hittites|Hittite]] and Syrian art.&lt;ref&gt;Martín Almagro-Gorbea, p. 149.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10695">In [[linguistics]], '''meaning''' is the information or concepts that a sender intends to convey, or does convey, in communication with a receiver.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=meaning|website=Dictionary.com Unabridged|publisher=Random House, Inc.|url=http://www.dictionary.com/browse/meaning|accessdate=December 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NS"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.njit.edu/~lipuma/352comproc/comproc.htm|title=Communication Process|author=Nick Sanchez|publisher=New Jersey Institute of Technology|accessdate=January 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The sources of ambiguity ==
{{+rs|date=March 2016}}
Ambiguity means confusion about what is conveyed, since the current context may lead to different interpretations of meaning. Many words in many languages have [[polysemy|multiple definitions]]. Ambiguity is an effect of a rupture of the [[Law of identity|rule of identity]] in the context of the exchange of information. Particularly the ''sender'' may be physically absent, and the contexts explicitly divergent, such as will be the case when the receptor is a reader and the ''sender'' was a writer.

=== Pragmatics ===
{{main|Pragmatics}}

Pragmatics is the study of how context affects meaning.  The two primary forms of context important to pragmatics are [[linguistic context]] and situation context.

Linguistic context is how meaning is understood without relying on intent and assumptions.  In applied pragmatics, for example, meaning is formed through sensory experiences, even though sensory stimulus cannot be easily articulated in language or signs.  Pragmatics, then, reveals that meaning is both something affected by and affecting the world.  Meaning is something contextual with respect to language and the world, and is also something active toward other meanings and the world. Linguistic context becomes important when looking at particular linguistic problems such as that of pronouns.

Situation context refers to every non-linguistic factor that affects the meaning of a phrase. An example of situation context can be seen in the phrase "it's cold in here", which can either be a simple statement of fact or a request to turn up the heat, depending on, among other things, whether or not it is believed to be in the listener's power to affect the temperature.

=== Semantic meaning ===
{{main|Semantics}}

The relationship between words and their referents is called semantic.&lt;ref&gt;https://tr.scribd.com/document/137895627/%D0%92-%D0%9D-%D0%9A%D0%BE%D0%BC%D0%B8%D1%81%D1%81%D0%B0%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%B2-%D0%9A%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%BB%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%B0&lt;/ref&gt; Semantics is the study of how meaning is conveyed through [[sign (semiotics)|sign]]s and [[language]]. Understanding how [[facial expressions]], [[body language]], and [[intonation (linguistics)|tone]] affect meaning, and how words, phrases, sentences, and punctuation relate to meaning are examples. Various subgroups of semantics are studied within the fields of linguistics, logic and [[Semantics (computer science)|computing]]. For example, [[Formal semantics (linguistics)|linguistic semantics]] includes the history of how words have been used in the past; [[Formal semantics (logic)|logical semantics]] includes how people mean and refer in terms of likely intent and assumptions.

During the 19th century, [[John Stuart Mill]] defined semantic meaning with the words "denotation" and "connotation".&lt;ref name="JSM"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/mill/#LanLog |title=John Stuart Mill |author=Fred Wilson |date=Jan 3, 2002 |work=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |publisher=Stanford |accessdate=October 8, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; A denotation is the literal or primary meaning of a word. Connotations are ideas or feelings that a word invokes for a person in addition to its literal or primary meaning.

The original use of "meaning" as understood early in the 20th century occurred through [[Lady Welby]], after her daughter translated the term "semantics" from French.

=== Conceptual meaning ===
{{main|Concept}}

Languages allow information to be conveyed even when the specific words used are not known by the reader or listener. People connect words with meaning and use words to refer to concepts. A person's intentions affect what is meant. ''Meaning'' (in English) as ''intent'' harkens back to the Anglo-Saxons and is associated today still, with the German verb ''[[wikt:meinen|meinen]]'' as to think or intend.

== Semiotics ==
{{main|Semiotics}}

[[Ferdinand de Saussure]], in founding semiology, his original subset of the semiotics, started describing language in terms of ''Signs'', dividing those ''signs'' in turn into ''signifieds'' and ''signifiers''.  The signifier is the [[perception|perceptive]] side of a sign, thus the [[Hearing|sound]] form in case of oral language.  The signified is the signification ([[semantics|semantic]]) side, the mental construction or image associated with the sound, by either a speaker and hearer. A sign, then, is essentially a relationship between signified and signifier.

Signs are essentially [[conventional]], as any foreign language student is well aware: there is no reason that ''bat'' couldn't mean "body of water" or even "that bust of Napoleon over there". Since the choice of signifiers is ultimately arbitrary, the meaning cannot somehow be ''in'' the signifier. Saussure instead defers meaning to the sign itself: meaning is ultimately the same thing as the sign, and ''meaning'' means that relationship is between signified and signifier. All meaning is both within us and communal, thus [[culture|cultural]]. Signs "mean" by reference to our internal lexicon and grammar, and despite there being a matter of convention, so the communal part, signs also, because of the individual's uniqueness, can mean something only to the individual (what ''red'' means to one person may not be what ''red'' means to another, either in absolute value, or by including what's suggested by the context). However, while meanings carried by one given set of signifiers may vary to some extent from individual to individual, only those meanings that stay within a boundary are seen by other speakers of the language to belong to the language: if one were to refer to smells as red, most other speakers would assume the person is talking nonsense (although statements like this are common among people who experience [[synesthesia]], or in poetry).

'''Naachtun'''{{Pronunciation-needed}} is an [[archaeological site]] of the [[pre-Columbian]] [[Maya civilization]], situated at the northeastern perimeter of the [[Mirador Basin]] region in the southern Maya lowlands, now in the modern-day Department of [[El Petén]], northern Guatemala. Naachtun was a major center of the region by the late Formative (or Pre-Classic) Period, and was one of the few Formative Period Mirador Basin centers which continued to flourish into the succeeding Classic period.

Situated in one of the areas most remote from contemporary settlements, the site was first rediscovered and documented in 1922 by the American archaeologist and [[Mayanist]] scholar, [[Sylvanus Morley]]. The name ''Naachtun'' was given to the site by Morley, taken from a [[Mayan languages|Mayan]] construction glossed as "distant stones", in recognition of its remoteness.  Its ancient name was Masuul, and it was in the middle of the Classic [[Maya civilization|Maya]] cities. The site is being investigated by the [[Calgary University]], where they have found that the site served as a link between [[Tikal]] and [[Calakmul]], that were the superpowers in the Classic, and in constant wars between them, perhaps using Massul as a "Neutral Talk Place". A carved stela with the "Lady of Tikal" has been recently found there.

During the beginning of the Early Classic period, the establishment of a royal dynasty marked Naachtun's initial sociopolitical and economic development with Tikal.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Residential areas reached their maximal occupation during the Late Classic period. Also during the beginning of the Late Classic period, a political shift occurred as Calakmul established their rule on the East Plaza of Group B. Relations with Tikal were cut during this time then re-established during the Maax 3 phase (740-830 CE).&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; By the Terminal Classic, Naachtun suffered a population loss leaving many of the residential structures abandoned. The population that remained settled in the Central and Southern Complexes located in Group B and remained there until the end of the 10th century.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Naachtun's population is believed to have used [[Slash-and-burn|slash and burn agricultural methods]] as suggested by the archeological record.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; 

== Site Description ==
The site is quite large, with several Pyramid temples and Acropolis, linked with [[sacbeob]], as well as 2 [[Mesoamerican ballcourt|ballcourts]]. The central area of Naachtun includes a “concentration of monumental buildings placed atop a limestone ridge bordering a seasonal swamp, or ''bajo'', to the north and a series of residential compounds of different sizes and compositions to the south.”&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Contreras|first=Alejandro Patiño|date=2016-06-21|title=Cerámica Tzakol e interacción social durante el Clásico Temprano.

The majority of the structures in Groups C and A were built during the Balam 2 phase (350-500 CE).&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; 

=== Group A ===
Group A includes three large plazas: the north, south and west plazas, a large [[E-Group]], Structure XXVII (a pyramid), “La Perdida” (another pyramid), and “a walled compound housing several palatial structures.”&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; There is also a ballcourt located next to Structures XIII and XIV. 

=== Group B ===
Group B contains a maze of [[masonry]] residential structures situated on low platforms that surround several patios of different sizes, a Western, Central and Southern Complex,&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; a pyramidal structure known as Structure XXV, Structure XXXVIII (a radial pyramid) and public structures (Structure 60-3 and 60-4), all arranged around two plazas: East Plaza and Plaza Río Bec.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The East Plaza was associated with the residences of the elite and was located in the Western Complex. 
=== Group C ===
Group C contains a group of several pyramidal buildings, a triadic group known as Structure I and a monumental [[acropolis]]. Structure I is linked to the ballcourt in Group A by a sacbeob.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Stelae ===
Archeologists have excavated 45 [[Maya stelae|stelae]] from Naachtun. One specific stelae-Stela 18- “presents a gigantic women crushing a confined Ox-Te-Tun captive beneath her.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/150641552|title=Late classic Maya worrior queens : profiling a new gender role|last=J.|first=Fritzler, Marlene|date=2005|isbn=0494053984|oclc=150641552}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stelae 18 is located on the terrace in front of Structure XXXVIII in Group B, on the east side of the main plaza. It is dated to the Late Classic period.

An '''opaque context''' or '''referentially opaque context''' is a [[context (language use)|linguistic context]] in which it is not always possible to substitute "co-referential" expressions (expressions referring to the same object) without altering the truth of sentences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Definition of "opaque context" {{!}} Collins English Dictionary|url = http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/opaque-context|website = www.collinsdictionary.com|accessdate = 2015-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The expressions involved are usually grammatically singular terms.  So, substitution of co-referential expressions into an opaque context does not always preserve truth. For example, "Lois believes x is a hero" is an opaque context because "Lois believes Superman is a hero" is true while "Lois believes Clark Kent is a hero" is false, even though 'Superman' and 'Clark Kent' are co-referential expressions.

==Usage==
The term is used in [[Philosophy|philosophical]] [[Sense and reference|theories of reference]], and is to be contrasted with "referentially transparent context".  In rough outline:

*Opacity: "Mary believes that [[Cicero]] is a great orator" gives rise to an opaque context; although Cicero was also called 'Tully', we can't simply substitute 'Tully' for 'Cicero' in this context ("Mary believes that Tully is a great orator") and guarantee the same truth value, for Mary might not know that the names 'Tully' and 'Cicero' refer to one and the same thing. Of course, if Mary does believe that Cicero is a great orator, then there is a sense in which Mary believes that Tully is a great orator, even if she does not know that 'Tully' and 'Cicero' ''corefer''. It is the sense forced on us by "direct reference" theories of proper names, i.e. those that maintain that the meaning of a proper name just is its referent.
*Transparency: "Cicero was a Roman orator" gives rise to a transparent context; there is no problem substituting 'Tully' for 'Cicero' here: "Tully was a Roman orator".  Both sentences necessarily express the same thing if 'Cicero' and 'Tully' refer to the same person.  Note that this element is missing in the opaque contexts, where a shift in the name can result in a sentence that expresses something different from the original.

Similar usage of the term applies for [[artificial language]]s such as [[programming language]]s and [[logic]]s.  The Cicero-Tully example above can be easily adapted.  Use the notation &lt;math&gt;[t]&lt;/math&gt; as a quotation that mentions a term &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;.  Define a predicate &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; to the effect that the letters making up a term number six.  Then &lt;math&gt;[x]&lt;/math&gt; induces an opaque context, or is '''referentially opaque''', because &lt;math&gt;L([Cicero])&lt;/math&gt; is true while &lt;math&gt;L([Tully])&lt;/math&gt; is false.  Programming languages often have richer semantics than logics' semantics of truth and falsity, and so an [[Operator (programming)|operator]] such as &lt;math&gt;[x]&lt;/math&gt; may fail to be referentially transparent for other reasons as well.

== Social origins in nature ==

=== Origin of social groups ===
==== Hobbes ====
[[Image:Leviathan_by_Thomas_Hobbes.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Frontispiece of "Leviathan," by [[Abraham Bosse]], with input from Hobbes]]
Arguably the most influential theory of human social origins is that of [[Thomas Hobbes]], who in his ''Leviathan''&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Hobbes. Leviathan: Or the Matter, Forme, and Power of a Common-Wealth Ecclesiasticall and Civill, ed. by Ian Shapiro (Yale University Press; 2010).&lt;/ref&gt; argued that without strong government, society would collapse into ''[[Bellum omnium contra omnes]]'' — "the war of all against all":
{{quotation|In such condition, there is no place for industry; because the fruit thereof is uncertain: and consequently no culture of the earth; no navigation, nor use of the commodities that may be imported by sea; no commodious building; no instruments of moving, and removing, such things as require much force; no knowledge of the face of the earth; no account of time; no arts; no letters; no society; and which is worst of all, continual fear, and danger of violent death; and the life of man, solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short.|{{Citation|title=Leviathan|chapter=Chapter XIII: Of the Natural Condition of Mankind As Concerning Their Felicity, and Misery.}}}} Hobbes' innovation was to attribute the establishment of society to a founding '[[social contract]]', in which the Crown's subjects surrender some part of their freedom in return for security.

If Hobbes' idea is accepted, it follows that society could not have emerged prior to the state. This school of thought has remained influential to this day.&lt;ref&gt;W. G. Runciman (ed.), ''The Origin of Human Social Institutions.'' Oxford: Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt; Prominent in this respect is British archaeologist [[Colin Renfrew]] (Baron Renfrew of Kaimsthorn), who points out that the state did not emerge until long after the evolution of ''Homo sapiens''. The earliest representatives of our species, according to Renfrew, may well have been ''anatomically'' modern, but they were not yet ''cognitively'' or ''behaviourally'' modern. For example, they lacked political leadership, large-scale cooperation, food production, organised religion, law or symbolic artefacts. Humans were simply hunter-gatherers, who — much like extant apes — ate whatever food they could find in the vicinity. Renfrew controversially suggests that hunter-gatherers to this day think and socialise along lines not radically different from those of their nonhuman primate counterparts. In particular, he says that they do not "ascribe symbolic meaning to material objects" and for that reason "lack fully developed 'mind.'"{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

However, hunter-gatherer ethnographers emphasise that extant foraging peoples certainly do have social institutions — notably institutionalised rights and duties codified in formal systems of kinship.&lt;ref&gt;Lévi Strauss, C. 1969. ''The Elementary Structures of Kinship''. London: Eyre and Spottiswoode.&lt;/ref&gt; Elaborate rituals such as initiation ceremonies serve to cement contracts and commitments, quite independently of the state.&lt;ref&gt;Van Gennep, A. 1960 [1909] ''The Rites of Passage.'' London: Routledge and Kegan Paul.&lt;/ref&gt; Other scholars would add that insofar as we can speak of "human revolutions" — "major transitions" in human evolution&lt;ref&gt;Maynard Smith, J. and E. Szathmáry 1995. ''The Major Transitions in Evolution.'' Oxford: W. H. Freeman.&lt;/ref&gt; — the first was not the Neolithic Revolution but the rise of symbolic culture that occurred toward the end of the Middle Stone Age.&lt;ref&gt;Mellars, P. A., K. Boyle, O. Bar-Yosef and C. Stringer (eds), 2007. ''Rethinking the Human Revolution: new behavioural and biological perspectives on the origin and dispersal of modern humans.'' Cambridge: McDonald Institute for Archaeological Research.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Knight, C., C. Power and I. Watts 1995. The human symbolic revolution: A Darwinian account. ''Cambridge Archaeological Journal.'' 5(1): 75–114.&lt;/ref&gt;

Arguing the exact opposite of Hobbes's position, anarchist anthropologist [[Pierre Clastres]] views the state and society as mutually incompatible: genuine society is always struggling to survive ''against'' the state.&lt;ref&gt;Clastres, P. 1977. ''[[Society Against the State]].'' Trans. R. Hurley in collaboration with A. Stein. Oxford: Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Jean-Jacques Rousseau ====
[[File:Jean-Jacques Rousseau (painted portrait).jpg|thumb|Rousseau in 1753]]
Like Hobbes, [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] argued that society was born in a social contract. In Rousseau's case, however, sovereignty is vested in the entire populace, who enter into the contract directly with one another. "The problem", he explained, "is to find a form of association which will defend and protect with the whole common force the person and goods of each associate, and in which each, while uniting himself with all, may still obey himself alone, and remain as free as before." This is the fundamental problem of which the Social Contract provides the solution. The contract's clauses, Rousseau continued, may be reduced to one — "the total alienation of each associate, together with all his rights, to the whole community. Each man, in giving himself to all, gives himself to nobody; and as there is no associate over whom he does not acquire the same right as he yields others over himself, he gains an equivalent for everything he loses, and an increase of force for the preservation of what he has". In other words: "Each of us puts his person and all his power in common under the supreme direction of the general will, and, in our corporate capacity, we receive each member as an indivisible part of the whole." At once, in place of the individual personality of each contracting party, this act of association creates a moral and collective body, composed of as many members as the assembly contains votes, and receiving from this act its unity, its common identity, its life and its will.&lt;ref&gt;Rousseau, J.-J. 1973 [1762]. The social contract. In Jean-Jacques Rousseau, ''The Social Contract and Discourses.'' ''Trans. G. D. H. Cole. New edition. London &amp; Melbourne: Dent. Book I, Ch. 6.''&lt;/ref&gt; By this means, each member of the community acquires not only the capacities of the whole but also, for the first time, rational mentality:

{{quotation|The passage from the state of nature to the civil state produces a very remarkable change in man, by substituting justice for instinct in his conduct, and giving his actions the morality they had formerly lacked. Then only, when the voice of duty takes the place of physical impulses and right of appetite, does man, who so far had considered only himself, find that he is forced to act on different principles, and to consult his reason before listening to his inclinations.|{{Citation|title= ''Jean-Jacques Rousseau,'' The Social Contract and Discourses. ''Trans. G. D. H. Cole. New edition. London &amp; Melbourne: Dent. Book I Ch. 8.''}}}}

====Sir Henry Sumner Maine====
In his influential book, ''Ancient Law'' (1861), Maine argued that in early times, the basic unit of human social organisation was the patriarchal family:

[[Image:Maine by Dickinson.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Sir Henry James Sumner Maine]]{{quotation|The effect of the evidence derived from comparative jurisprudence is to establish the view of the primeval condition of the human race which is known as the Patriarchal Theory.|{{Citation|title= ''Maine, H. S. 1861. ''Ancient Law.'' London: John Murray. p. 122.''}}}}

Hostile to French revolutionary and other radical social ideas, Maine's motives were partly political. He sought to undermine the legacy of Rousseau and other advocates of man’s natural rights by asserting that originally, no one had any rights at all – ‘every man, living during the greater part of his life under the patriarchal despotism, was practically controlled in all his actions by a regimen not of law but of caprice’.&lt;ref&gt;Maine, H. S. 1861. ''Ancient Law.'' London: John Murray. p.8.&lt;/ref&gt; Not only were the patriarch’s children subject to what Maine calls his ‘despotism’: his wife and his slaves were equally affected. The very notion of kinship, according to Maine, was simply a way of categorizing those who were forcibly subjected to the despot’s arbitrary rule. Maine later added a Darwinian strand to this argument. In his ''The Descent of Man,'' Darwin had cited reports that a wild-living male gorilla would monopolise for itself as large a harem of females as it could violently defend. Maine endorsed Darwin’s speculation that ‘primeval man’ probably 'lived in small communities, each with as many wives as he could support and obtain, whom he would have jealously guarded against all other men’.&lt;ref&gt;Darwin, C. 1871. ''The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex,'' 2 vols. London: Murray. Vol. 2, p. 362.&lt;/ref&gt; Under pressure to spell out exactly what he meant by the term 'patriarchy', Maine clarified that ‘sexual jealousy, indulged through power, might serve as a definition of the Patriarchal Family’.&lt;ref&gt;Maine, H.

[[File:Lewishenrymorgan.jpg|200px|thumb|Lewis H. Morgan]]
In his influential book, ''Ancient Society'' (1877), its title echoing Maine's ''Ancient Law,'' [[Lewis Henry Morgan]] proposed a very different theory. Morgan insisted that throughout the earlier periods of human history, neither the state nor the family existed.

{{quotation| It may be here premised that all forms of government are reducible to two general plans, using the word plan in its scientific sense. In their bases the two are fundamentally distinct. The first, in the order of time, is founded upon persons, and upon relations purely personal, and may be distinguished as a society ''(societas)''. The gens is the unit of this organization; giving as the successive stages of integration, in the archaic period, the gens, the phratry, the tribe, and the confederacy of tribes, which constituted a people or nation (''populus''). At a later period a coalescence of tribes in the same area into a nation took the place of a confederacy of tribes occupying independent areas. Such, through prolonged ages, after the gens appeared, was the substantially universal organization of ancient society; and it remained among the Greeks and Romans after civilization supervened. The second is founded upon territory and upon property, and may be distinguished as a state ''(civitas).''|{{Citation|title= ''Morgan, L. H. 1877.'' Ancient Society. ''Chicago: Charles H. Kerr, p. 6.''}}}} In place of both family and state, according to Morgan, was the ''gens'' — nowadays termed the 'clan' — based initially on matrilocal residence and matrilineal descent. This aspect of Morgan's theory, later endorsed by Karl Marx and Frederick Engels, is nowadays widely considered discredited (but for a critical survey of the current consensus, see Knight 2008, 'Early Human Kinship Was Matrilineal'&lt;ref&gt;Knight, C. 2008. [http://www.radicalanthropologygroup.org/old/class_text_105.pdf Early human kinship was matrilineal]. In N. J. Allen, H. Callan, R. Dunbar and W. James (eds.), ''Early Human Kinship''. Oxford: Blackwell, pp. 61–82.&lt;/ref&gt;).

==== Frederick Engels ====
[[File:Engels.jpg|thumb|200px|Frederick Engels]]

[[Frederick Engels]] built on Morgan's ideas in his 1884 essay, ''The Origin of the Family, Private Property and the State in the light of the researches of Lewis Henry Morgan.'' His primary interest was the position of women in early society, and — in particular — Morgan's insistence that the matrilineal clan preceded the family as society's fundamental unit. 'The mother-right gens', wrote Engels in his survey of contemporary historical materialist scholarship, 'has become the pivot around which the entire science turns...' Engels argued that the matrilineal clan represented a principle of self-organization so vibrant and effective that it allowed no room for patriarchal dominance or the territorial state.{{quotation|The first class antagonism which appears in human history coincides with the development of the antagonism between man and woman in monogamian marriage, and the first class oppression with that of the female sex by the male.|{{Citation|title= ''Engels, F. 1940 [1884]'' The origin of the family, private property and the state.

====Emile Durkheim====
{{Infobox scientist
|name = Émile Durkheim

|image_size = 200px}}

[[Emile Durkheim]] considered that in order to exist, any human social system must counteract the natural tendency for the sexes to promiscuously conjoin. He argued that social order presupposes sexual morality, which is expressed in prohibitions against sex with certain people or during certain periods — in traditional societies particularly during menstruation.

{{quotation|One first fact is certain: that is, that the entire system of prohibitions must strictly conform to the ideas that primitive man had about menstruation and about menstrual blood. For all these taboos start only with the onset of puberty: and it is only when the first signs of blood appear that they reach their maximum rigour.|{{Citation|title= ''Durkheim, E. 1963 [1898]. La prohibition de l'inceste et ses origines.'' L'Année Sociologique ''1: 1–70. Reprinted as'' Incest. The nature and origin of the taboo, ''trans. E. Sagarin. New York: Stuart, p. 81.''}}}}

The incest taboo, wrote Durkheim in 1898, is no more than a particular example of something more basic and universal - the ritualistic setting apart of 'the sacred' from 'the profane'. This begins as the segregation of the sexes, each of which - at least on important occasions - is 'sacred' or 'set apart' from the other. 'The two sexes', as Durkheim explains, 'must avoid each other with the same care as the profane flees from the sacred and the sacred from the profane.' Women as sisters act out the role of 'sacred' beings invested 'with an isolating power of some sort, a power which holds the masculine population at a distance.' Their menstrual blood in particular sets them in a category apart, exercising a 'type of repulsing action which keeps the other sex far from them'. In this way, the earliest ritual structure emerges — establishing morally regulated 'society' for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;Durkheim, E. 1963. [1898] La prohibition de l’inceste et ses origines. ''L’Année Sociologique'' 1: 1–70. Reprinted as ''Incest. The nature and origin of the taboo,'' trans. E. Sagarin. New York: Stuart.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Sigmund Freud====
[[Charles Darwin]] pictured early human society as resembling that of apes, with one or more dominant males jealously guarding a harem of females.&lt;ref&gt;Darwin, C. 1871. ''The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex,'' 2 vols. London: Murray. Vol. 2, p. 362.&lt;/ref&gt; In his myth of the 'Primal Horde', [[Sigmund Freud]] later took all this as his starting point but then postulated an insurrection mounted by the tyrant's own sons:{{quotation|All that we find there is a violent and jealous father who keeps all the females for himself and drives away his sons as they grow up…. One day the brothers who had been driven out came together, killed and devoured their father and so made an end of the patriarchal horde.|{{Citation|title= ''Freud, S. 1965 [1913].'' Totem and Taboo. ''London: Routledge, p. 141.''}}}} Following this, the band of brothers were about to take sexual possession of their mothers and sisters when suddenly they were overcome with remorse. In their contradictory emotional state, their dead father now became stronger than the living one had been. In memory of him, the brothers revoked their deed by forbidding the killing and eating of the 'totem' (as their father had now become) and renouncing their claim to the women who had just been set free. In this way, the two fundamental taboos of primitive society – not to eat the totem and not to marry one's sisters – were established for the first time.

====Marshall Sahlins====
A related but less dramatic version of Freud's 'sexual revolution' idea was proposed in 1960 by American social anthropologist [[Marshall Sahlins]].&lt;ref&gt;Sahlins, M. D. 1960. The origin of society. ''Scientific American'' 203(3): 76–87.&lt;/ref&gt; Somehow, he writes, the world of primate brute competition and sexual dominance was turned upside-down: {{quotation|The decisive battle between early culture and human nature must have been waged on the field of [[primate sexuality]]….  Among subhuman primates sex had organized society; the customs of hunters and gatherers testify eloquently that now society was to organize sex…. In selective adaptation to the perils of the Stone Age, human society overcame or subordinated such primate propensities as selfishness, indiscriminate sexuality, dominance and brute competition. It substituted kinship and co-operation for conflict, placed solidarity over sex, morality over might. In its earliest days it accomplished the greatest reform in history, the overthrow of human primate nature, and thereby secured the evolutionary future of the species.|{{Citation|title= ''Sahlins, M. D. 1960 The origin of society.'' Scientific American ''203(3): 76–87.''}}}}

==== Christopher Boehm ====
{{quotation| Once a prehistoric hunting band institutionalized a successful and decisive rebellion, and did away with the alpha-male role permanently... it is easy to see how this institution would have spread.|{{Citation|title=''Boehm, C. 2000.'' ''Journal of Consciousness Studies 7, 1–2 pp. 79–101; p. 97.''}}}}
If we accept Rousseau's line of reasoning, no single dominant individual is needed to embody society, to guarantee security or to enforce social contracts. The people themselves can do these things, combining to enforce the general will. A modern origins theory along these lines is that of evolutionary anthropologist [[Christopher Boehm]]. Boehm argues that ape social organisation tends to be despotic, typically with one or more dominant males monopolising access to the locally available females. But wherever there is dominance, we can also expect resistance. In the human case, resistance to being personally dominated intensified as humans used their social intelligence to form coalitions. Eventually, a point was reached when the costs of attempting to impose dominance became so high that the strategy was no longer evolutionarily stable, whereupon social life tipped over into 'reverse dominance' — defined as a situation in which only the entire community, on guard against primate-style individual dominance, is permitted to use force to suppress deviant behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;Boehm, C. 2001. ''Hierarchy in the Forest. The evolution of egalitarian behavior.'' Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Ernest Gellner ====
Human beings, writes social anthropologist Ernest Gellner, are not genetically programmed to be members of this or that social order. You can take a human infant and place it into any kind of social order and it will function acceptably. What makes human society so distinctive is the fabulous range of quite different forms it takes across the world. Yet in any given society, the range of permitted behaviours is quite narrowly constrained. This is not owing to the existence of any externally imposed system of rewards and punishments. The constraints come from within — from certain compulsive moral concepts which members of the social order have internalised. The society installs these concepts in each individual's psyche in the manner first identified by Emile Durkheim, namely, by means of collective rituals such as initiation rites. Therefore, the problem of the origins of society boils down to the problem of the origins of collective ritual.

{{quotation|How is a  society established, and a series of societies diversified, whilst each of them is restrained from chaotically exploiting that wide diversity of possible human behaviour? A theory is available concerning how this may be done and it is one of the basic theories of social anthropology. The way in which you restrain people from doing a wide variety of things, not compatible with the social order of which they are members, is that you subject them to ritual. The process is simple: you make them dance around a totem pole until they are wild with excitement, and become jellies in the hysteria of collective frenzy; you enhance their emotional state by any device, by all the locally available audio-visual aids, drugs, music and so on; and once they are really high, you stamp upon their minds the type of concept or notion to which they subsequently become enslaved.|{{Citation|title=''Gellner, E. 1988. Origins of Society. In A. C. Fabian (ed.),'' Origins. The Darwin College Lectures. ''Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, pp.128–140; p. 130.''}}}}

===Gender and origins===
Feminist scholars — among them palaeoanthropologists Leslie Aiello and Camilla Power — take similar arguments a step further, arguing that any reform or revolution which overthrew male dominance must surely have been led by women. Evolving human females, Power and Aiello suggest, actively separated themselves from males on a periodic basis, using their own blood (and/or pigments such as red ochre) to mark themselves as fertile and defiant: {{quotation|The sexual division of labor entails differentiation of roles in food procurement, with logistic hunting of large game by males, co-operation and exchange of products. Our hypothesis is that symbolism arose in this context. To minimize energetic costs of travel, coalitions of women began to invest in home bases. To secure this strategy, women would have to use their attractive, collective signal of impending fertility in a wholly new way: by signalling refusal of sexual access except to males who returned "home" with provisions. Menstruation — real or artificial — while biologically the wrong time for fertile sex, is psychologically the right moment for focusing men's minds on imminent hunting, since it offers the prospect of fertile sex in the near future.|{{Citation|title= ''Power, C. and L. C. Aiello 1997. Female proto-symbolic strategies. In L. D. Hager (ed.),'' Women in Human Evolution. ''New York and London: Routledge, pp. 153–171; p. 159.''}}}} In similar vein, anthropologist Chris Knight argues that Boehm's idea of a 'coalition of everyone' is hard to envisage, unless — along the lines of a modern industrial picket line — it was formed to co-ordinate 'sex-strike' action against badly behaving males: {{quotation|....male dominance had to be overthrown because the unending prioritising of male short-term sexual interests could lead only to the permanence and institutionalisation of behavioural conflict between the sexes, between the generations and also between rival males. If the symbolic, cultural domain was to emerge, what was needed was a political collectivity — an alliance — capable of transcending such conflicts. ... Only the consistent defence and self-defence of mothers with their offspring could produce a collectivity embodying interests of a sufficiently broad, universalistic kind.|{{Citation|title=''Knight, C. 1991.'' Blood Relations. Menstruation and the origins of culture. ''New Haven and London: Yale University Press'', p. 514}}}} In virtually all hunter-gatherer ethnographies, according to Knight, a persistent theme is that 'women like meat',&lt;ref&gt;Biesele, M. 1993. ''Women Like Meat. The folklore and foraging ideology of the Kalahari Ju/'hoan.'' Witwatersrand: University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; and that they determinedly use their collective bargaining power to motivate men to hunt for them and bring home their kills — on pain of exclusion from sex.&lt;ref&gt;Knight, C. 1991.

''Homo Novus – A Human Without Illusions.''

==Sociobiological theories==
=== Robert Trivers ===

{{quotation|I consider Trivers one of the great thinkers in the history of Western thought. It would not be too much of an exaggeration to say that he has provided a scientific explanation for the human condition: the intricately complicated and endlessly fascinating relationships that bind us to one another.|[https://www.edge.org/3rd_culture/trivers04/trivers04_index.html ''Steven Pinker on Robert Trivers'']}}

In his 1985 book, ''Social Evolution'',&lt;ref&gt;Trivers, R. L. 1985. ''Social Evolution''. Menlo Park, CA: Benjamin/Cummings.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert Trivers]] outlines the theoretical framework used today by most evolutionary biologists to understand how and why societies are established. Trivers sets out from the fundamental fact that genes survive beyond the death of the bodies they inhabit, because copies of the same gene may be replicated in multiple different bodies. From this, it follows that a creature should behave altruistically to the extent that those benefiting carry the same genes — 'inclusive fitness', as this source of cooperation in nature is termed.&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton, W. D. 1964. The genetical evolution of social behaviour. I, II. ''Journal of Theoretical Biology'' 7: 1–52.&lt;/ref&gt; Where animals are unrelated, cooperation should be limited to 'reciprocal altruism' or 'tit-for-tat'.&lt;ref&gt;Trivers, R. L. 1971. The Evolution of Reciprocal Altruism. ''The Quarterly Review of Biology'' 46 (1): 35–57.&lt;/ref&gt;
Where previously, biologists took parent-offspring cooperation for granted, Trivers predicted on theoretical grounds both cooperation and conflict — as when a mother needs to wean an existing baby (even against its will) in order to make way for another.&lt;ref&gt;Trivers, R. L. 1974. Parent-Offspring Conflict. ''American Zoologist'' 14 (1): 249–264.&lt;/ref&gt; Previously, biologists had interpreted male infanticidal behaviour as aberrant and inexplicable or, alternatively, as a necessary strategy for culling excess population.&lt;ref&gt;Wynne-Edwards, V.C. 1962. ''Animal dispersion in relation to social behaviour.'' Edinburgh: Oliver &amp; Boyd.&lt;/ref&gt; Trivers was able to show that such behaviour was a logical strategy by males to enhance their own reproductive success at the expense of conspecifics including rival males. Ape or monkey females whose babies are threatened have directly opposed interests, often forming coalitions to defend themselves and their offspring against infanticidal males.&lt;ref&gt;Trivers, R. L. 1985. ''Social Evolution.'' Menlo Park, CA: Benjamin/Cummings, pp 79–85.&lt;/ref&gt;
Human society, according to Trivers, is unusual in that it involves the male of the species investing parental care in his own offspring — a rare pattern for a primate. Where such cooperation occurs, it's not enough to take it for granted: in Trivers' view we need to ''explain'' it using an overarching theoretical framework applicable to humans and nonhumans alike.&lt;ref&gt;Trivers, R. L. 1972. Parental investment and sexual selection. In B. Campbell (ed.) ''Sexual selection and the descent of man, 1871–1971''. Chicago, Aldine, pp. 136–179.&lt;/ref&gt;{{quotation|Everybody has a social life. All living creatures reproduce and reproduction is a social event, since at its bare minimum it involves the genetic and material construction of one individual by another. In turn, differences between individuals in the number of their surviving offspring (natural selection) is the driving force behind organic evolution. Life is intrinsically social and it evolves through a process of natural selection which is itself social. For these reasons social evolution refers not only to the evolution of social relationships between individuals but also to deeper themes of biological organization stretching from gene to community.|{{Citation|title=''Robert Trivers, 1985.'' Social Evolution. ''Menlo Park, California: Benjamin/Cummings, p. vii.''}}}}

=== Robin Dunbar ===

[[Image: Robin Dunbar (6293027302).jpg |thumb|right|200px|Robin Dunbar]][[Robin Dunbar]] originally studied gelada baboons in the wild in Ethiopia, and has done much to synthesise modern primatological knowledge with Darwinian theory into a comprehensive overall picture. The components of primate social systems 'are essentially alliances of a political nature aimed at enabling the animals concerned to achieve more effective solutions to particular problems of survival and reproduction'.&lt;ref&gt;Dunbar. 1988. ''Primate Social Systems.'' Chapman Hall and Yale University Press, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; Primate societies are in essence 'multi-layered sets of coalitions'.&lt;ref&gt;Dunbar. 1988. ''Primate Social Systems.'' Chapman Hall and Yale University Press, p. 106.&lt;/ref&gt; Although physical fights are ultimately decisive, the social mobilisation of allies usually decides matters and requires skills that go beyond mere fighting ability. The manipulation and use of coalitions demands sophisticated social — more precisely ''political'' — intelligence.
Usually but not always, males exercise dominance over females. Even where male despotism prevails, females typically gang up with one another to pursue agendas of their own. When a male gelada baboon attacks a previously dominant rival so as to take over his harem, the females concerned may insist on their own say in the outcome. At various stages during the fighting, the females may 'vote' among themselves on whether to accept the provisional outcome. Rejection is signalled by refusing to groom the challenger; acceptance is signalled by going up to him and grooming him. According to Dunbar, the ultimate outcome of an inter-male 'sexual fight' always depends on the female 'vote'.&lt;ref&gt;Dunbar. 1988. ''Primate Social Systems.'' Chapman Hall and Yale University Press, pp. 166, 167, 243.&lt;/ref&gt;
Dunbar points out that in a primate social system, lower-ranking females will typically suffer the most intense harassment. Consequently, they will be the first to form coalitions in self-defence. But maintaining commitment from coalition allies involves much time-consuming manual grooming, putting pressure on time-budgets. In the case of evolving humans, who were living in increasingly large groups, the costs would soon have outweighed the benefits — unless some more efficient way of maintaining relationships could be found. Dunbar argues that 'vocal grooming' — using the voice to signal commitment — was the time-saving solution adopted, and that this led eventually to speech. Dunbar goes on to suggest (citing evolutionary anthropologist Chris Knight&lt;ref&gt;Knight, C. 2011 [1989]. [http://www.radicalanthropologygroup.org/old/pub_origins_hs.pdf ''The origins of society.''] London: Radical Anthropology Group.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Knight, C. 1991. ''Blood Relations. Menstruation and the origins of culture.'' New Haven and London: Yale University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;) that ''distinctively human'' society may have been evolved under pressure from female ritual and 'gossiping' coalitions established to dissuade males from fighting one another and instead cooperate in hunting for the benefit of the whole camp: {{quotation| If females formed the core of these early groups, and language evolved to bond these groups, it naturally follows that the early human females were the first to speak. This reinforces the suggestion that language was first used to create a sense of emotional solidarity between allies. Chris Knight has argued a passionate case for the idea that language first evolved to allow the females in these early groups to band together to force males to invest in them and their offspring, principally by hunting for meat. This would be consistent with the fact that, among modern humans, women are generally better at verbal skills than men, as well as being more skilful in the social domain. |{{Citation|title=''Dunbar, R. I. M. 1996.'' Grooming, Gossip and the Evolution of Language. ''London: Faber and Faber, p. 149.''}}}} Dunbar stresses that this is currently a minority theory among specialists in human origins — most still support the 'bison-down-at-the-lake' theory attributing early language and cooperation to the imperatives of men's activities such as hunting. Despite this, he argues that 'female bonding may have been a more powerful force in human evolution than is sometimes supposed'.&lt;ref&gt;Dunbar, R. I. M. 1996. ''Grooming, Gossip and the Evolution of Language.'' London: Faber and Faber, p. 150.&lt;/ref&gt; Although still controversial, the idea that female coalitions may have played a decisive role has subsequently received strong support from a number of anthropologists including Sarah Hrdy,&lt;ref&gt;Hrdy,  S. B. 2009. ''Mothers and others. The evolutionary origins of mutual understanding.'' London and Cambridge, MA: Belknap Press of Harvard University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Camilla Power,&lt;ref&gt;Power, C. 1998. Old wives’ tales: the gossip hypothesis and the reliability of cheap signals.

{{Paleolithic}}

'''Paleolithic religions''' are a set of [[spirituality| spiritual]] beliefs thought to have appeared during the [[Paleolithic]] time period. [[Religious behaviour]] is thought{{by whom?|date=February 2017}} to have emerged by the [[Upper Paleolithic]], before 30,000 years ago at the latest,&lt;ref&gt;Andre Leroi-Gourhan and Annette Michelson, "The Religion of the Caves: Magic or Metaphysics?",  ''The MIT Press'', Vol, 37, October 1986, pp. 6-17. "[[cave art]] born 30,000 years before our era ... would appear to have developed simultaneously with the first explicit manifestations of concern with the supernatural." (p. 6)&lt;/ref&gt; but behavioral patterns such as [[burial rite]]s that one might characterize as religious — or as ancestral to religious behaviour — reach back into the [[Middle Paleolithic]], as early as 300,000 years ago, coinciding with the first appearance of ''[[Homo neanderthalensis]]'' and possibly ''[[Homo naledi]]''. It is speculated that religious behaviour may combine (for example) [[religion and ritual|ritual]], [[spirituality]], [[myth and religion|mythology]] and [[Magic and religion|magical thinking]] or [[animism]] — aspects that may have had separate histories of development during the Middle Paleolithic before combining into "religion proper" of [[behavioral modernity]].{{or|date=February 2017}}

There are suggested cases for the first appearance of religious or spiritual experience in the [[Lower Paleolithic]] (significantly earlier than 300,000 years ago, pre-''Homo sapiens''), but these remain controversial and have limited support.&lt;ref&gt;See for example [http://www.originsnet.org/mindold.html ''Oldowan Art, Religion, Symbols, Mind''] by James Harrod and Vincent W. Fallio; [http://www.originsnet.org/aboutornet1.html About OriginsNet by James Harrod]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Middle Paleolithic]] spans the period from 300,000 to 50,000 years ago. Some of the earliest significant evidence of religious practices dates from this period. Intentional [[burial]], particularly with [[grave goods]] may be one of the earliest detectable forms of religious practice since, as [[Philip Lieberman]] suggests, it may signify a "concern for the dead that transcends daily life."&lt;ref name="lieberman"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3tS2MULo5rYC&amp;pg=PA162 | title=Uniquely Human|isbn=0-674-92183-6| year=1991| authorlink=Philip Lieberman}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though disputed, evidence suggests that the [[Neanderthals]] were the first [[Homo (genus)|humans]] to intentionally bury the dead, doing so in shallow graves along with stone tools and animal bones.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=The World's Largest Neanderthal Finding Site |url=http://www.culturenet.hr/default.aspx?id=23639&amp;pregled=1&amp;datum=9.1.2009%2015:00:13 |publisher=Culturenet |accessdate=7 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Exemplary sites include [[Shanidar]] in Iraq, [[Kebara Cave]] in Israel and [[Krapina]] in Croatia. Some scholars, however argue that these bodies may have been disposed of for [[secular]] reasons.&lt;ref name="evolving_graves"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1200/is_24_160/ai_81827792/pg_1|title=FindArticles.com – CBSi|website=findarticles.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Cut marks on Neanderthal bones from various sites such as [[Combe-Grenal]] and [[Abri Moula]] in [[France]] may imply that the [[Neanderthal#Ritual defleshing|Neanderthals]] may have practiced [[Excarnation|excarnation]].

Likewise a number of archeologists propose that Middle Paleolithic societies — such as that of the Neanderthals — may also have practiced the earliest form of [[totemism]] or [[animal worship]] in addition to their (presumably religious) burial of the dead. Emil Bächler in particular suggests (based on archeological evidence from Middle Paleolithic caves) that a widespread Neanderthal [[bear worship|bear-cult]] existed.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-idWunn2000|Wunn, 2000]], p.&amp;nbsp;434-435&lt;/ref&gt; Animal cults in the following Upper Paleolithic period — such as the bear cult — may have had their origins in these hypothetical Middle Paleolithic animal cults.&lt;ref name=Narr&gt;{{cite web |url=http://concise.britannica.com/oscar/print?articleId=109434&amp;fullArticle=true&amp;tocId=52333 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080409074119/http://concise.britannica.com/oscar/print?articleId=109434&amp;fullArticle=true&amp;tocId=52333 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2008-04-09 |author=Karl J.

The earliest undisputed human burial dates back 100,000 years. Human skeletal remains stained with [[red ochre]] were discovered in the [[Skhul]] cave and [[Kedumim Cave|Qafzeh]], Israel. A variety of grave goods were present at the site, including the mandible of a wild boar in the arms of one of the skeletons.&lt;ref name="lieberman2"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=3tS2MULo5rYC&amp;pg=PA163&amp;dq=Uniquely+Human++qafzeh&amp;ei=F-AeR_ntI5WGpgLkrsWzBg&amp;sig=k7GcMq8PU_B6tX56Cf95ENxmJIQ Uniquely Human page 163]{{unreliable source?|date=February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[anatomically modern human]] (as opposed to the Neanderthals) inhabitants of the Near East during that time, may have invented this form of ritualized burial practice.&lt;ref name="lieberman2" /&gt; Middle stone age sites in Africa dating to around the same time-frame also show an increased use of [[red ochre]], a pigment thought to have symbolic value.&lt;ref name="religous_mind"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.selu.edu/Academics/Faculty/mrossano/recentpubs/EvolOfReligionFinal.pdf|title=The Religious Mind and the Evolution of Religion|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.anth.uconn.edu/faculty/mcbrearty/Pdf/McB%202003%20CA%20Comment%20on%20Hovers.pdf|title=An early case of color symbolism|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.anth.uconn.edu/faculty/sosis/publications/ritualalcortasosis5.pdf|title=Ritual, Emotion, and Sacred Symbols: The Evolution of Religion as an Adaptive Complex|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Religious behaviour is one of the hallmarks of [[behavioral modernity]], generally assumed to have emerged around 50,000 years ago, marking the transition from the middle to the Upper Paleolithic. It was probably more common during the early Upper Paleolithic for religious ceremonies to receive equal and full participation from all members of the band in contrast to the religious traditions of later periods when religious authorities and part-time ritual specialists such as shamans, priests and medicine men were relatively common and integral to religious life.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=MKhe6qNva10C&amp;q=paleolithic+society&amp;dq=paleolithic+society&amp;pgis=1 ''Stavrianos''], pg 10&lt;/ref&gt;

Evidence of burial with grave goods and the appearance of [[anthropomorphic]] images and cave paintings may suggest that humans in the Upper Paleolithic had begun to believe in supernatural beings.&lt;ref name="mithen"&gt;{{cite book| authorlink=Steve Mithen|isbn=0-500-05081-3| title=The Prehistory of the Mind: The Cognitive Origins of Art, Religion and Science| year=1996| publisher=Thames &amp; Hudson}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cave paintings of [[Chauvet Cave|Chauvet]] have been dated to 32,000 and those at [[Lascaux]] to 17,000 years ago. At Lascaux the anthropomorphic paintings show depictions of strange beasts such as ones that are half-human and half-bird and half-human and half-lion. Consequently, some{{Who|date=July 2009}} have seen these as indications of [[Shamanism|shamanistic beliefs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=11Em-3BOTTUC&amp;pg=PA37&amp;lpg=PA37&amp;dq=shamanism+chauvet&amp;source=web&amp;ots=ATXw7tauhf&amp;sig=sFrEcBU2u6WmoXBafUZl5TjYxc8#PPA39,M1|chapter=Poesy en Masse|title=The Strong Eye of Shamanism|year=1999|last=Ryan|isbn=0-89281-709-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vincent W. Fallio writes that [[Ancestor worship|ancestor cults]] first emerged in complex Upper Paleolithic societies. Fallio argues that the elites of complex Upper Paleolithic societies (like the elites of many contemporary complex hunter-gatherers such as the [[Tlingit people|Tlingit]]) may have used special rituals and ancestor worship to solidify control over their societies by convincing their subjects that they possess a link to the spirit world that gives them control over both the earthly realm and access to the spiritual realm.&lt;ref name="V.Fallio"&gt;{{cite book | author=Vincent W.

Religion was often [[apotropaism|apotropaic]]; specifically, it involved sympathetic magic.&lt;ref name=Miller2006&gt;{{cite book | title = Anthropology |last=Miller |first=Barbra |author2=Bernard Wood |author3=Andrew Balansky |author4=Julio Mercader |author5=Melissa Panger |year=2006 |publisher=Allyn and Bacon |location=Boston Massachusetts |isbn= 0-205-32024-4 | pages= 768}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Venus figurines]] — which occur abundantly in the Upper Paleolithic archeological record — provide an example of Paleolithic sympathetic magic: people may have used them for ensuring success in hunting and to bring about fertility of the land and women.&lt;ref name="McClellan"&gt;{{cite book | author=McClellan|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aJgp94zNwNQC&amp;printsec=frontcover#PPA11 | title=Science and Technology in World History: An Introduction| location=Baltimore, Maryland | publisher=JHU Press | year=2006 | isbn=0-8018-8360-1}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=aJgp94zNwNQC&amp;printsec=frontcover#PPA8 Page 8-12]&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars have sometimes explained the Upper Paleolithic Venus figurines as depictions of an [[earth goddess]] similar to [[Gaia (mythology)|Gaia]] or as representations of a goddess who is the ruler or mother of the animals.&lt;ref name="Narr" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Christopher L.

The '''philosophy of human rights''' attempts to examine the underlying basis of the concept of [[human rights]] and critically looks at its content and justification. Several theoretical approaches have been advanced to explain how and why the concept of human rights developed.

One of the oldest Western philosophies on human rights is that they are a product of a natural law, stemming from different philosophical or religious grounds. Other theories hold that human rights codify moral behavior which is a human social product developed by a process of biological and social evolution (associated with [[David Hume|Hume]]). Human rights are also described as a sociological pattern of rule setting (as in the sociological theory of law and the work of [[Max Weber|Weber]]). These approaches include the notion that individuals in a society accept rules from legitimate authority in exchange for security and economic advantage (as in [[John Rawls|Rawls]]) – a social contract. The two theories that dominate contemporary human rights discussion are the interest theory and the will theory. Interest theory argues that the principal function of human rights is to protect and promote certain essential human interests, while will theory attempts to establish the validity of human rights based on the unique human capacity for freedom.&lt;ref name="IEOP"&gt;{{cite web|last=Fagan|first=Andrew|title=Human Rights|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/hum-rts/#SH4b|publisher=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|accessdate=20 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Natural rights==

{{Main article|Natural law|Natural right}}

Natural law theories base human rights on a "natural" moral, religious or even biological order that is independent of transitory human laws or traditions.

[[Socrates]] and his philosophic heirs, [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]], posited the existence of [[natural justice]] or natural right (δίκαιον φυσικόν ''dikaion physikon''; [[Latin]] ''ius naturale''). Of these, Aristotle is often said to be the father of natural law,&lt;ref&gt;Shellens (1959)&lt;/ref&gt; although evidence for this is due largely to the interpretations of his work by [[Thomas Aquinas]].&lt;ref&gt;Jaffa (1979)&lt;/ref&gt;

The development of this tradition of natural justice into one of natural law is usually attributed to the [[Stoicism|Stoics]].&lt;ref&gt;Sills (1968, 1972) ''Natural Law''&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the early [[Church Fathers]] sought to incorporate the until then [[paganism|pagan]] concept of natural law into [[Christianity]]. Natural law theories have featured greatly in the [[philosophy|philosophies]] of [[Thomas Aquinas]], [[Francisco Suárez]], [[Richard Hooker]], [[Thomas Hobbes]], [[Hugo Grotius]], [[Samuel von Pufendorf]], and [[John Locke]].

In the 16th century, asked by the Spanish monarchs to investigate the legitimacy of claims to land dominion by the ''indios'' of Latin America, Francisco de Vitoria expounded a theory of natural rights, especially in his famous ''Relectio de Indis''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Williams|first=Thomas D.|title=The Pre-Hobbesian Roots of Natural Rights Theory|url=http://www.uprait.org/archivio_pdf/ao7103-williams.pdf|publisher=Alpha Omega|accessdate=10 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 17th century [[Thomas Hobbes]] founded a [[social contract|contractualist theory]] of [[legal positivism]] beginning from the principle that man in the state of nature, which is to say without a "commonwealth" (a state) is in a state of constant war one with the other and thus in fear of his life and possessions (there being no property nor right without a sovereign to define it). Hobbes asserted natural law as how a rational human, seeking to survive and prosper, would act; the first principle of natural law being to seek peace, in which is self-preservation. Natural law (which Hobbes accepted was a misnomer, there being no law without a commonwealth) was discovered by considering humankind's natural interests, whereas previous philosophers had said that natural rights were discovered by considering the natural law. In Hobbes' opinion, the only way natural law could prevail was for human beings to agree to create a commonwealth by submitting to the command of a sovereign, whether an individual or an assembly of individuals. In this lay the foundations of the theory of a social contract between the governed and the governor.

[[Hugo Grotius]] based his philosophy of international law on natural law. He wrote that "even the will of an [[omnipotence|omnipotent]] being cannot change or abrogate" natural law, which "would maintain its objective validity even if we should assume the impossible, that there is no [[God]] or that he does not care for human affairs." (''De iure belli ac pacis'', Prolegomeni XI). This is the famous argument ''etiamsi daremus'' (''non esse Deum''), that made natural law no longer dependent on theology.

[[John Locke]] incorporated natural law into many of his theories and philosophy, especially in ''[[Two Treatises of Government]]''. Locke turned Hobbes' prescription around, saying that if the ruler went against natural law and failed to protect "life, liberty, and property," people could justifiably overthrow the existing state and create a new one.

The Belgian philosopher of law [[Frank Van Dun]] is one among those who are elaborating a secular conception&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://users.ugent.be/~frvandun/Texts/Logica/NaturalLaw.htm|author=van Dun, Frank|accessdate=28 December 2007 |title=Natural Law}}&lt;/ref&gt; of natural law in the liberal tradition. There are also emerging and secular forms of natural law theory that define human rights as derivative of the notion of universal human dignity.&lt;ref&gt;Kohen (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

"Dignity" is a key term for the discussion of human rights. The [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] does not justify its claims on any philosophical basis, but rather it simply appeals to human dignity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Theology and the Boundary Discourse of Human Rights|last = Regan|first = Ethna|publisher = Georgetown University Press|year = 2010|isbn = 978-1-58901-642-2|location = Washington D.C.|pages = 18–19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Karl Rahner]] discusses human dignity as it relates to freedom. Specifically, his ideas of freedom relate to human rights as an appeal to the freedom to [[Karl Rahner#Incarnation-grace|communicate with the divine]]. As embodied individuals who can have this freedom and dignity threatened by external forces, the protection of this dignity takes on an appeal to protect human rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Theology and the Boundary Discourse of Human Rights|last = Regan|first = Ethna|publisher = Georgetown University Press|year = 2010|isbn = 978-1-58901-642-2|location = Washington, D.C.|pages = 85–86}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "human rights" has replaced the term "natural rights" in popularity, because the rights are less and less frequently seen as requiring natural law for their existence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Weston, Burns H.|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9106289?query=human%20rights&amp;ct=eb|title=Human Rights|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica Online, p. 2|accessdate=18 May 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; For some, the debate on human rights remains thus a debate around the correct interpretation of Natural Law, and human rights themselves a positive, but reductionist, expression thereof&lt;ref&gt;Jakob Cornides, [http://works.bepress.com/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1016&amp;context=jakob_cornides Natural and Un-Natural Law], New York, C-Fam (2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Social contract==

The English philosopher [[Thomas Hobbes]] suggested the existence of a hypothetical ''social contract'' where a group of free individuals agree for the sake of preservation to form institutions to govern them. They give up their natural complete liberty in exchange for protection from the Sovereign. This led to [[John Locke]]'s theory that a failure of the government to secure rights is a failure which justifies the removal of the government, and was mirrored in later postulation by [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] in his "Du Contrat Social" ([[The Social Contract]]).

International [[equity (law)|equity]] expert Paul Finn has echoed this view:

{{cquote|the most fundamental fiduciary relationship in our society is manifestly that which exists between the community (the people) and the state, its agencies and [[official]]s.|||Paul Finn&lt;ref name = "zogvfu"/&gt;}}

The relationship between government and the governed in countries which follow the [[English law]] tradition is a [[fiduciary]] one. In equity law, a politician's fiduciary obligations are not only the duties of good faith and loyalty, but also include duties of skill and [[competence (human resources)|competence]] in managing a country and its people. Originating from within the [[Court of equity|Courts of Equity]], the fiduciary concept exists to prevent those holding positions of power from abusing their authority. The fiduciary relationship between government and the governed arises from the governments ability to control people with the exercise of its power. In effect, if a government has the power to abolish any rights, it is equally burdened with the fiduciary duty to protect such an interest because it would benefit from the exercise of its own discretion to extinguish rights which it alone had the power to dispose of.&lt;ref name = "zogvfu"&gt;Salevao (2005) p.76&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reciprocity==

The Golden Rule, or the ''[[ethic of reciprocity]]'' states that one must do unto others as one would be treated themselves; the principle being that reciprocal recognition and respect of rights ensures that one's own rights will be protected. This principle can be found in all the world's major religions in only slightly differing forms, and was enshrined in the "Declaration Toward a Global Ethic" by the [[Parliament of the World's Religions]] in 1993.

==Soviet concept of human rights==

{{Main article|Human rights in the Soviet Union}}

Soviet concept of human rights was different from conceptions prevalent in the West. According to Western legal theory, "it is the individual who is the beneficiary of human rights which are to be asserted ''against'' the government", whereas Soviet law declared that [[State (polity)|state]] is the source of human rights.&lt;ref&gt;Lambelet, Doriane. "The Contradiction Between Soviet and American Human Rights Doctrine: Reconciliation Through Perestroika and Pragmatism." 7 ''Boston University International Law Journal''. 1989. p. 61-62.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=shiman&gt;{{cite book | last = Shiman | first = David | title = Economic and Social Justice: A Human Rights Perspective | publisher = Amnesty International | year= 1999 | url = http://www1.umn.edu/humanrts/edumat/hreduseries/tb1b/Section1/tb1-2.htm | isbn = 0-9675334-0-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, Soviet legal system regarded [[law]] as an arm of politics and courts as agencies of the government.&lt;ref name="Pipes"/&gt; Extensive [[Extrajudicial punishment|extra-judiciary powers]] were given to the [[Chronology of Soviet secret police agencies|Soviet secret police agencies]]. The regime abolished Western [[rule of law]], [[civil liberties]], [[Criminal justice|protection of law]] and [[Property rights|guarantees of property]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Pipes]] (2001) ''Communism'' Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson. {{ISBN|0-297-64688-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Pipes]] (1994) ''Russia Under the Bolshevik Regime''. Vintage. {{ISBN|0-679-76184-5}}., pages 401–403.&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Vladimir Lenin]], the purpose of [[People's court (Soviet Union)|socialist courts]] was "not to eliminate [[Red Terror|terror]] ... but to substantiate it and legitimize in principle".&lt;ref name="Pipes"/&gt;

Crime was determined not as the infraction of law, but as any action which could threaten the Soviet state and society. For example, [[Speculation|a desire to make a profit]] could be interpreted as a [[Counter-revolutionary|counter-revolutionary activity]] punishable by death.&lt;ref name="Pipes"/&gt; [[Dekulakization|The liquidation and deportation of millions peasants in 1928–31]] was carried out within the terms of Soviet Civil Code.&lt;ref name="Pipes"&gt;[[Richard Pipes]] ''Russia Under the Bolshevik Regime'', Vintage books, Random House Inc., New York, 1995, {{ISBN|0-394-50242-6}}, pages 402–403&lt;/ref&gt; Some Soviet legal scholars even asserted that "criminal repression" may be applied in the absence of guilt.".&lt;ref name="Pipes"/&gt; [[Martin Latsis]], chief of the Ukrainian [[Cheka]] explained: "Do not look in the file of incriminating evidence to see whether or not the accused rose up against the Soviets with arms or words. Ask him instead to which [[social class|class]] he belongs, what is his background, his [[education]], his [[profession]]. These are the questions that will determine the fate of the accused. That is the meaning and essence of the [[Red Terror]]."&lt;ref name="State"&gt;[[Yevgenia Albats]] and Catherine A. Fitzpatrick. ''The State Within a State: The KGB and Its Hold on Russia – Past, Present, and Future'', 1994. {{ISBN|0-374-52738-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The purpose of [[Show trial|public trials]] was "not to demonstrate the existence or absence of a crime – that was predetermined by the appropriate [[CPSU|party authorities]] – but to provide yet another forum for [[Soviet propaganda|political agitation and propaganda]] for the instruction of the citizenry (see [[Moscow Trials]] for example).

The philosopher [[John Finnis]] argues that human rights are justifiable on the grounds of their instrumental value in creating the necessary conditions for human well-being.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/h/hum-rts.htm#SH4b|title=''Human Rights''|publisher=The Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|author=Fagan, Andrew|year=2006|accessdate=1 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Finnis (1980)&lt;/ref&gt; Interest theories highlight the duty to respect the rights of other individuals on grounds of self-interest:

{{Main article|Human security}}
[[Human security]] is an emerging school of thought which challenges the traditional, state-based conception of security and argues that a people-focused approach to security is more appropriate in the modern interdependent world and would be more effective in advancing the security of individuals and societies across the globe.

;Ipso facto legal rights theory

According to the recommendation of human rights scholar Barrister Dr Mohammed Yeasin Khan LLB Honours, LLM, PhD, PGDL, Barrister-at-Law (Lincoln’s Inn), UK: ‘Right’ being synonymous of ‘legal’ and antonymous of both ‘wrong’ and ‘illegal’, every ‘right’ of any human person is ipso facto a ‘legal right’ which deserves protection of law and legal remedy irrespective of having been written into the law, constitution or otherwise in any country.&lt;ref&gt;Protection and Promotion of Human Rights for Peace and Development: Barrister Dr Mohammed Yeasin Khan LlB Honours, LLM, PhD, PGDL, Barrister-at-Law (Lincoln’s Inn), UK. [Page 63]&lt;/ref&gt;

;Man for man theory of world peace

According to Barrister Dr Mohammed Yeasin Khan: The only way ‘(a) to make the world terrorism and war free and also free from hunger, poverty, discrimination and exploitation; (b) to establish rule of law and economic, political and social justice; and (c) to confirm freedom of man, peace and development worldwide’ is protection and promotion human rights as ‘Ipso Facto Legal Rights’ and the unity of the world community in one and single theory of ‘man for man’ correlative, interdependent and ‘one to one-cum-one for other’ approach, namely, the ‘Man for Man Theory’ approach of world peace.&lt;ref&gt;Protection and Promotion of Human Rights for Peace and Development: Barrister Dr Mohammed Yeasin Khan, LLB Honours (London), LLM (Northumbria), PhD (CIU), PGDL (Northumbria), Barrister-at-Law (Lincoln’s Inn), UK [Page 70-71]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critiques of human rights==

The idea of [[human rights]] is not without its critics. [[Jeremy Bentham]], [[Edmund Burke]], [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] and [[Karl Marx]] are examples of historical philosophers who criticised the notion of [[natural rights]]. [[Alasdair MacIntyre]] is a leading contemporary critic of human rights. His criticisms are discussed below.

===Edmund Burke on natural rights===

[[Edmund Burke]] was an 18th-century philosopher, political theorist and statesman largely associated with the school of [[conservatism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hampsher-Monk|first=Iain|title=The political philosophy of Edmund Burke|year=1987|publisher=Longman|location=New Work|pages=preface, x}}&lt;/ref&gt; His views on [[natural rights]] are best articulated in ''[[Reflections on the Revolution in France]]'', which directly attacked the ''[[Declaration of the Rights of Man and the Citizen]]'' (1789) and its authors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Waldron|first=Jeremy|title=Nonsense Upon Stilts: Bentham, Burke and Marx on the Rights of Man|year=1987|publisher=Methuen &amp; co.|location=New York|pages=81–82}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A great deal of Burke’s uneasiness of the ''Declaration'' lies in the drafter’s abandonment of the existing establishment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Waldron|first=Jeremy|title=Nonsense Upon Stilts: Bentham, Burke and Marx on the Rights of Man|year=1987|publisher=Methuen &amp; co.|location=New York|pages=88}}&lt;/ref&gt; For Burke, constitutional legitimacy was derived not from the Rousseauian doctrine of [[general will]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Waldron|first=Jeremy|title=Nonsense Upon Stilts: Bentham, Burke and Marx on the Rights of Man|year=1987|publisher=Methuen &amp; co.|location=New York|pages=89}}&lt;/ref&gt; but from a form of inherited wisdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Canavan|first=Francis P.|title=The Political Reason of Edmund Burke|year=1960|publisher=Duke University Press|location=London|pages=131}}&lt;/ref&gt; He thought that it was arrogant and limiting for the drafters of the ''Declaration'' to cast aside traditional notions that had stood the test of time.&lt;ref name="Burke"&gt;{{cite web|last=Burke|first=Edmund|title=Reflections on the Revolution in France 1790|url=http://www.constitution.org/eb/rev_fran.htm#01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;“they have no respect for the wisdom of others; but they pay it off by a very full measure of confidence in their own”&lt;/ref&gt; Although it may seem to the drafters that they had abandoned the shackles of tradition, for Burke, they had limited their findings to the narrow minded conception of one person or group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mosher|first=Michael A.|title=The Skeptic's Burke: Reflections on the Revolution in Frabce, 1790-1990|journal=Political Theory|date=August 1991|volume=19|issue=3|pages=391–418 at 404|doi=10.1177/0090591791019003006}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is the grounding from which Burke’s attack of the ''Declaration'' is based.

Burke did not deny the existence of natural rights; rather he thought that the [[a priori (epistemology)|a priori]] reasoning adopted by the drafters produced notions that were too abstract to have application within the framework of society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Canavan|first=Francis P.|title=The Political Reason of Edmund Burke|year=1960|publisher=Duke University Press|location=London|pages=115}}&lt;/ref&gt; In stating that “the pretended right of these theorists are all extremes; and in a proportion as they are metaphysically true, they are morally and politically false”,&lt;ref name="Burke"/&gt; Burke identified that abstract rights are meaningless without a societal framework:

{{cquote|What is the use of discussing a man’s abstract right to food or medicine? The question is upon the method of procuring and administering them.|||Edmund Burke&lt;ref name="Burke"/&gt;}}

In contrast to [[John Locke|Locke]], Burke did not believe the purpose of government was to protect pre-existing natural rights;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Freeman|first=Michael|title=Edmund Burke and the Critique of Political Radicalism|year=1980|publisher=Basil Blackwell Publisher|location=Oxford|pages=59}}&lt;/ref&gt; he believed “the primitive rights of man undergo such a variety of refractions and reflections, that it becomes absurd to talk of them as if they continued in the simplicity of their original direction.”&lt;ref name="Burke"/&gt; For Burke it was the government, as a result of long social evolution, that transformed the meaningless natural rights into the practical advantaged afforded to citizens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Canavan|first=Francis P.|title=The Political Reason of Edmund Burke|year=1960|publisher=Duke University Press|location=London|pages=132}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was not the rights themselves, as much as the level of abstraction and the placing of them above government which Burke found dangerous.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Freeman|first=Michael|title=Edmund Burke and the Critique of Political Radicalism|year=1980|publisher=Basil Blackwell Publisher|location=Oxford|pages=90}}&lt;/ref&gt; He stated “those who pull down important ancient establishments, who wantonly destroy modes of administration, and public institutions… are the most mischievous, and therefore the wickedest of men”.&lt;ref name="Burke"/&gt; For Burke politics had no simple answers, and definitely no overarching, universal maxims such as those expressed in the ''Declaration''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Waldron|first=Jeremy|title=Nonsense Upon Stilts: Bentham, Burke and Marx on the Rights of Man|year=1987|publisher=Methuen &amp; co.|location=New York|pages=86}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rather the rights afforded to individuals were to be assessed in the context of the social framework.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Canavan|first=Francis P.|title=The Political Reason of Edmund Burke|year=1960|publisher=Duke University Press|location=London|pages=118}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, he acknowledged that the simplicity of the ''Declaration'' was attractive and feared its ability to undermine social order.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Freeman|first=Michael|title=Edmund Burke and the Critique of Political Radicalism|year=1980|publisher=Basil Blackwell Publisher|location=Oxford|pages=72}}&lt;/ref&gt; Burke believed that the absolute nature of these principles of abstraction were inherently revolutionary; they were uncompromising and any derogation from the principles a reason to rise up in arms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Freeman|first=Michael|title=Edmund Burke and the Critique of Political Radicalism|year=1980|publisher=Basil Blackwell Publisher|location=Oxford|pages=89}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was a problem because;

{{cquote|All government… is founded on compromise and barter. We balance inconveniences; we give and take; we remit some rights, that we may enjoy others; and we choose rather to be happy citizens, than subtle disputants.|||Edmund Burke&lt;ref name="Burke"/&gt;}}

The natural rights “Against which there can be no prescription; against these no agreements is binding”&lt;ref name="Burke"/&gt; gave the revolutionaries the tools to destroy the very society that Burke believed afforded them with rights. In this way Burke thought the rights contained in the ''Declaration'' would lead to “the antagonist world of madness, discord, vice, confusion, and unavailing sorrow.”&lt;ref name="Burke"/&gt;

===Jeremy Bentham on natural rights===

The 18th-century [[Utilitarian]] philosopher [[Jeremy Bentham]] criticised the ''[[Declaration of the Rights of Man and the Citizen]]'' in his text ''Anarchical Fallacies''. He famously asserted that the concept of natural rights was “nonsense upon stilts”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bentham|first=Jeremy|title=Anarchical Fallacies|url=http://www.law.georgetown.edu/faculty/lpw/documents/Bentham_Anarchical_Fallacies.pdf|page=line. 229}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bentham criticised the ''Declaration'' both for the language that it adopted and the theories it posited, stating; “Look to the letter, you find nonsense; look beyond the letter, you find nothing.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bentham|first=Jeremy|title=Anarchical Fallacies|url=http://www.law.georgetown.edu/faculty/lpw/documents/Bentham_Anarchical_Fallacies.pdf|page=line.104}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the critiques Bentham levelled against the ''Declaration'' was its assertions of rights in the form of absolute and universal norms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Waldron|first=Jeremy|title=Nonsense Upon Stilts: Bentham, Burke and Marx on the Rights of Man|year=1987|publisher=Methuen &amp; co.|location=New York|pages=38}}&lt;/ref&gt; He identified that absolute rights possessed by everyone equally are meaningless and undesirable. They lack meaning because if everyone has, for example, unbounded liberty, there is nothing precluding them from using that liberty to impinge on the liberty of another. In this way “human government and human laws”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Parakh|first=Bhikhu|title=Bentham's Political Thought|year=1973|publisher=Croom Helm|location=London|pages=272}}&lt;/ref&gt; are required to give some bounds to rights in order for them to be realised.&lt;ref name="Waldron 1987 39"&gt;{{cite book|last=Waldron|first=Jeremy|title=Nonsense Upon Stilts: Bentham, Burke and Marx on the Rights of Man|year=1987|publisher=Methuen &amp; co.|location=New York|pages=39}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even if advocates of absolute rights recognise this necessity, as the proponents of the ''Declaration'' did, Bentham argues that it is in vain.&lt;ref name="Waldron 1987 39"/&gt; “It would be self-contradictory, because these rights are, in the same breath which their existence is declared, declared to be impresciptable; and impriscriptable… means nothing unless it excludes the interference of the laws.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bentham|first=Jeremy|title=Anarchical Fallacies|url=http://www.law.georgetown.edu/faculty/lpw/documents/Bentham_Anarchical_Fallacies.pdf|page=line. 317}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to this contradiction, Bentham warned of the dangers of couching rights in absolute terms. A government that is able to protect every person’s right absolutely and equally is a utopian aspiration, but the ''Declaration'' couches it as the conditions for its legitimacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Waldron|first=Jeremy|title=Nonsense Upon Stilts: Bentham, Burke and Marx on the Rights of Man|year=1987|publisher=Methuen &amp; co.|location=New York|pages=42}}&lt;/ref&gt; “Against every government which fails in any degree of fulfilling these expectations, then, it is the professed object of this manifesto to excite insurrection.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Parakh|first=Bhikhu|title=Bentham's Political Thought|year=1973|publisher=Croom Helm|location=London|pages=280}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bentham does not deny that there are some laws that are morally wrong; his uneasiness is in easily justifying a revolutionary call to arms – with the violence, chaos and destruction associated with it – based on a repugnant law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Waldron|first=Jeremy|title=Nonsense Upon Stilts: Bentham, Burke and Marx on the Rights of Man|year=1987|publisher=Methuen &amp; co.|location=New York|pages=41}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Of the theoretical faults, Bentham thought that natural rights were a construction adopted to pursue the selfish aims of the drafters, of which no logical basis could be found.&lt;ref name="Philip Schofield 1832"&gt;Philip Schofield, "Bentham, Jeremy (1748–1832)"; Ed. Donald M. Borchert, ''Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' (Vol. 1. 2nd ed. Detroit: Macmillan Reference USA, 2006) at 555&lt;/ref&gt; He acknowledged that it may be desirable to have rights, but “a reason for wishing that a certain right were established, is not that right; want is not supply; hunger is not bread.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bentham|first=Jeremy|title=Anarchical Fallacies|url=http://www.law.georgetown.edu/faculty/lpw/documents/Bentham_Anarchical_Fallacies.pdf|page=line 226}}&lt;/ref&gt; To establish rights existed by virtue of laws enacted by a sovereign was logically sound, but to assert rights established by nature was not.&lt;ref name="Philip Schofield 1832"/&gt; “A natural right is a son that never had a father.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Waldron|first=Jeremy|title=Nonsense Upon Stilts: Bentham, Burke and Marx on the Rights of Man|year=1987|publisher=Methuen &amp; co.|location=New York|pages=73}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Not only did Bentham think that there was no logical basis for the theory of natural rights, but he believed that their individualistic approach was harmful to society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Waldron|first=Jeremy|title=Nonsense Upon Stilts: Bentham, Burke and Marx on the Rights of Man|year=1987|publisher=Methuen &amp; co.|location=New York|pages=33}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{cquote|The great enemies of public peace are the selfish and the dissocial passions – necessary as they are – the one to the very existence of each individual, the other to his security…What has been the object, the perpetual and palpable object, of this declaration to pretended rights? To add such force as possible to these passions, but already too strong, - to burst the cords that hold them in, - to say to the selfish passions, there – everywhere – is your prey! - to the angry passions, there –everywhere- is your enemy. Such is the morality of this celebrated manifesto.|||Jeremy Bentham&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bentham|first=Jeremy|title=Anarchical Fallacies|url=http://www.law.georgetown.edu/faculty/lpw/documents/Bentham_Anarchical_Fallacies.pdf|page=line 64}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Bentham thought that society was dependent upon people's ability to pursue the greater good, not just the short-term satisfaction of their own desires. The advancement of natural rights, which he saw as celebrating selfishness, was to provide the means to break down the social community that makes human life bearable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Waldron|first=Jeremy|title=Nonsense Upon Stilts: Bentham, Burke and Marx on the Rights of Man|year=1987|publisher=Methuen &amp; co.|location=New York|pages=33–34}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Marxist Critique of human rights===
In [[On the Jewish Question]], [[Karl Marx]] criticized ''Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen'' as bourgeois ideology:
:''Above all, we note the fact that the so-called rights of man, the droits de l'homme as distinct from the droits du citoyen, are nothing but the rights of a member of civil society – i.e., the rights of egoistic man, of man separated from other men and from the community. ... according to the Declaration of the Rights of Man of 1791:
:''"Liberty consists in being able to do everything which does not harm others."''
:''Liberty, therefore, is the right to do everything that harms no one else. The limits within which anyone can act without harming someone else are defined by law, just as the boundary between two fields is determined by a boundary post.''
and that:
:''Security is the supreme social concept of bourgeois society, the concept of the police, the whole society exists only to ensure each of its members the preservation of his person, his rights and his property.''

Thus for Marx, liberal rights and ideas of justice are premised on the idea that each of us needs protection from other human beings. Therefore, liberal rights are rights of separation, designed to protect us from such perceived threats. Freedom on such a view, is freedom from interference. What this view denies is the possibility — according to Marx, the fact — that real freedom is to be found positively in our relations with other people. It is to be found in human community, not in isolation. So insisting on a regime of rights encourages us to view each other in ways which undermine the possibility of the real freedom we may find in human emancipation.

Marxist critical theorist [[Slavoj Žižek]] argued that: "liberal attitudes towards the other are characterized both by respect for otherness, openness to it, and an obsessive fear of harassment. In short, the other is welcomed insofar as its presence is not intrusive, insofar as it is not really the other. Tolerance thus coincides with its opposite. My duty to be tolerant towards the other effectively means that I should not get too close to him or her, not intrude into his space—in short, that I should respect his intolerance towards my over-proximity. This is increasingly emerging as the central human right of advanced capitalist society: the right not to be 'harassed', that is, to be kept at a safe distance from others." and "universal human rights are effectively the right of white, male property-owners to exchange freely on the market, exploit workers and women, and exert political domination."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://libcom.org/library/against-human-rights-zizek |title=Against human rights - Slavoj Žižek |publisher=libcom.org|date=2010-02-19 |accessdate=29 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

British sociologist [[Robert Fine]] claims that the key to Marx’s argument was to rebut the radicalism Bauer espoused: a radicalism that not only denied the rights of Jews but at once trashed the rights of man and citizen as such. What Marx stood for in the Jewish Question as in his earlier writings more generally was a philosophy of right. Fine believes what Marx stood against was a spiritless radicalism that revealed its inhumanity not only through its hostility to Jews but also through its hostility to the idea of right." Moreover, Fine argued that Marx argued that the society that gives rise to the idea of rights is the same as that which gives rise to the commodity form. They are two sides of the same medal. It is a society based on production by independent producers whose contact with each other is mediated through the exchange of products on the market. These producers are formally free to produce what and how much they wish. They are formally equal in that no producer can force others to produce against their will or expropriate their products against their will. They are self-interested in that they are all entitled to pursue their own private interests regardless of what others think or do. Their contact with other producers takes the form of free and equal exchanges in which individuals exchange their property in return for the property of another and this exchange of unneeded things in return for useful things appears to be done for the mutual benefit of each party.

Fine also claims that for Marx, exchange relations appear to be formed among free and equal property owners who enter a voluntary contract in pursuit of their own self-interest. Fine cites what he believes to be Marx's point about how in exchange lies the clue to all modern conceptions of freedom and equal right:

:Although individual A feels a need for the commodity of individual B, he does not appropriate it by force, nor vice versa, but rather recognise one another reciprocally as proprietors, as persons whose will penetrates their commodities. Accordingly, the juridical moment of the Person enters here… all inherent contradictions of bourgeois society appear extinguished ... and bourgeois democracy even more than the bourgeois economists takes refuge in this aspect.: (Marx, Grundrisse:243, 251)

Furthermore, the parties to the exchange must place themselves in relation to one another as persons whose will resides in those objects and must behave in such a way that each does not appropriate the commodity of the other and alienate his own, except through an act to which both parties consent. Marx characterised this sphere of commodity exchange as ‘a very Eden of the innate rights of man’ – the realm of Freedom, Equality, Property and
Bentham:

:‘Freedom because both buyer and seller of a commodity ... are determined only by their own free will....Equality because each enters into relations with the other as with a simple owner of commodities and they exchange equivalent with equivalent. Property because each disposes only what is his own. And Bentham because each looks only to his own advantage. The only force bringing them together is the selfishness, the gain and the private interest of each.: (Marx, Capital 1: 280)

Thus according to [[Robert Fine]], Marx's basic criticism was that within political society people were seen as co-operative, while in their economic roles they were competitive, individualistic and egoistic. In short, the theory of rights expressed the division and alienation of human beings.

===Alasdair MacIntyre on human rights===

[[Alasdair MacIntyre]] is a Scottish philosopher who has published a number of works in a variety of philosophical fields, including [[political philosophy]], [[ethics]] and [[metaphysics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Clayton|first1=Ted|title=Political Philosophy of Alasdair MacIntyre|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/p-macint/|work=Internet Encyclopaedia of Philosophy|accessdate=31 December 2005 |editor1=James Fieser|editor2=Bradley Dowden}}&lt;/ref&gt; MacIntyre criticises the concept of [[human rights]] in [[After Virtue]] and he famously asserts that “there are no such rights, and belief in them is one with belief in witches and in unicorns.”&lt;ref name="MacIntyre 1981 67"&gt;{{cite book|last=MacIntyre|first=Alasdair|title=After Virtue|year=1981|publisher=Gerald Duckworth &amp; Co.|location=London|pages=67}}&lt;/ref&gt;

MacIntyre argues that every attempt at justifying the existence of human rights has failed. The assertions by 18th century philosophers that [[natural rights]] are self-evident truths, he argues, are necessarily false as there are no such things as self-evident truths. He says that the plea 20th century philosophers made to intuition show a flaw in philosophical reasoning. MacIntyre then outlines that, although [[Ronald Dworkin|Dworkin]] is not wrong in asserting that the inability to demonstrate a statement does not necessitate its falsity, the same argument can be applied in relation to witches and unicorns.&lt;ref name="MacIntyre 1981 67"/&gt;

MacIntyre made this critique of human rights in the context of a wider argument about the failure of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] to produce a coherent moral system.&lt;ref name="Knight 1998 70"&gt;{{cite book|last=Knight|first=Kelvin|title=The MacIntyre Reader|year=1998|publisher=Polity Press|location=Cambridge|pages=70}}&lt;/ref&gt; Philosophers of the enlightenment sought to cast aside the discredited notions of hierarchy and [[theology]] as justifications for morality. Instead, MacIntyre argues, the enlightenment placed the individual as the sovereign authority to dictate what is right and wrong. However allegiances to historical notions of morality remained and philosophers sought to find a secular and rational justification for existing beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=MacIntyre|first=Alasdair|title=After Virtue|year=1981|publisher=Gerald Duckworth &amp; Co.|location=London|pages=60}}&lt;/ref&gt; The problem, MacIntyre maintains, is that theological morality was developed to overcome defects in human nature; to posit an example of the ideal. Without this notion of ‘perfect humanity’ the only remaining foundation to build a moral theory on was the foundation of imperfect human nature.&lt;ref&gt;J. L. A. Garcia, "Modern(ist) Moral Philosophy and MacIntyrean Critique" in ed. Mark C. Murphy ''Alasdair MacIntyre'' (2003, Cambridge, Cambridge University Press) at pp 135–136&lt;/ref&gt; For MacIntyre, the result was a collection of moral stances, each claiming to have a rational justification and each disputing the findings of the rival notions.&lt;ref name="Knight 1998 70"/&gt;

MacIntyre believes that a number of the moral debates that occur in society can be explained as a result of this failure of the “Enlightenment Project”.&lt;ref&gt;J. L. A. Garcia, "Modern(ist) Moral Philosophy and MacIntyrean Critique" in ed. Mark C. Murphy ''Alasdair MacIntyre'' (2003, Cambridge, Cambridge University Press) at pp 96&lt;/ref&gt; Human rights are an example of a moral belief, founded in previous theological beliefs, which make the false claim of being grounded in rationality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Knight|first=Kelvin|title=The MacIntyre Reader|year=1998|publisher=Polity Press|location=Cambridge|pages=66}}&lt;/ref&gt; To illustrate how the principles lead to conflict, he gives the example of [[abortion]]; in this case the right of the mother to exercise control over her body is contrasted with the deprivation of a potential child to the right to life. Although both the right to liberty and the right to life are, on their own, considered morally acceptable claims, conflict arises when we posit them against each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=MacIntyre|first=Alasdair|title=After Virtue|year=1981|publisher=Gerald Duckworth &amp; Co.|location=London|pages=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theory of value and property==
{{See also|Property}}
[[Henry of Ghent]] articulated the theory that every person has a property interest in their own body.&lt;ref&gt;Tierney (1997)&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Locke]] uses the word property in both broad and narrow senses. In a broad sense, it covers a wide range of human interests and aspirations; more narrowly, it refers to material goods. He argues that property is a natural right and it is derived from labour.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Locke]]&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, property precedes government and government cannot "dispose of the estates of the subjects arbitrarily." To deny valid property rights according to Locke is to deny human rights. The British philosopher had significant impacts upon the development of the Government of the UK and was central to the fundamental founding philosophy of the United States. [[Karl Marx]] later critiqued Locke's theory of property in his ''Theories of Surplus Value'', seeing the beginnings of a theory of [[surplus value]] in Locke's works. In Locke's ''Second Treatise'' he argued that the right to own private property was unlimited as long as nobody took more than they could use without allowing any of their property to go to waste and that there were enough common resources of comparable quality available for others to create their own property. Locke did believe that some would be more "industrious and rational" than others and would amass more property, but believed this would not cause shortages. Though this system could work before the introduction of [[money]], Marx argued in ''Theories of Surplus Value'' that Locke's system would break down and claimed money was a contradiction of the law of nature on which private property was founded.&lt;ref&gt;Vaughn (1978)&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="49661">"'''Right to know'''", in the context of United States workplace and community [[environmental law]], is the legal principle that the individual has the right to know the chemicals to which they may be exposed in their daily living. It is embodied in [[United States federal law|federal]] law in the [[United States]] as well as in [[Local government|local]] laws in several states. "Right to Know" laws take two forms: Community Right to Know and Workplace Right to Know.  Each grants certain rights to those groups. The "right to know" was a movement made popular by [[Rachel Carson]] with her book ''[[Silent Spring]]''.&lt;ref name="carson"&gt;{{cite book|last=Carson|first=Rachel|title=Silent Spring|year=1962|publisher=Houghton Mifflin|pages=13, 278}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Environmental illness shares characteristics with common diseases. For example, [[cyanide]] exposure symptoms include weakness, headache, nausea, confusion, dizziness, seizures, cardiac arrest, and unconsciousness.&lt;ref name="Pesticide User's Guide"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ohioline.osu.edu/b745/b745_4.html|title=Pesticide User's Guide|publisher=Ohio State University|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110901101226/http://ohioline.osu.edu/b745/b745_4.html|archivedate=2011-09-01|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The Facts About Cyanides"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.health.state.ny.us/environmental/emergency/chemical_terrorism/cyanide_general.htm|title=The Facts About Cyanides|publisher=New York Department of Health}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Influenza]] and [[heart disease]] include the same symptoms. Cyanide is one of the most toxic known substances, and failure to obtain proper disclosure is likely to lead to improper or ineffective medical diagnosis and treatment. This can contribute to prolonged illness and death.

==Europe==

Europe consists of many countries, each of which has its own laws. The European Commission provides central access to most of the information about individual regulatory agencies and laws.

Right to know about environmental hazards is managed by the European Commission Directorate for the Environment and by the [[European Environment Agency]].

==United States==

Toxic substances used in the work area must be disclosed to the occupants under laws managed by [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.osha.gov/pls/oshaweb/owadisp.show_document?p_table=FACT_SHEETS&amp;p_id=151|title=Hazard Communication Standard|publisher=United States Department of Labor}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.osha.gov/pls/oshaweb/owadisp.show_document?p_table=standards&amp;p_id=10099|title=29 C.F.R. 1910.1200; Hazard Communication|publisher=United States Department of Labor}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.osha.gov/pls/oshaweb/owadisp.show_document?p_table=FEDERAL_REGISTER&amp;p_id=13349|title=29 CFR Parts 1910, 1915, 1917, 1918, 1926, and 1928; Final Rules|publisher=United States Department of Labor}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hazardous substances used outside buildings must be disclosed to the appropriate state or local agency responsible for [http://www.epa.gov/epahome/state.htm State Environmental Protection Agency]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/epahome/state.htm|title= State Environmental Protection Agency|publisher=United States Environmental Protection Agency}}&lt;/ref&gt; regulatory actions outside federal land. Use on federal land is managed by [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] and [http://www.nbii.gov/portal/server.pt/community/education_and_outreach/945/for_land_managers/2758 Bureau of Land Management].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nbii.gov/portal/server.pt/community/education_and_outreach/945/for_land_managers/2758|title=Community Education and Outreach|publisher=Bureau of Land Management}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Department of Defense is self-regulating, and as such, is immune to state and federal law pertaining to OSHA and EPA regulations on foreign and domestic soil.

=== OSHA ===
Occupational Health and Safety is managed within most states under federal authority.
* [http://www.osha.gov/dcsp/osp/index.html State Occupational Safety and Health Plans]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.osha.gov/dcsp/osp/index.html|title=State Occupational Safety and Health Plans|publisher=Occupational Health and Safety Administration}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Workplace safety and health in the U.S. operates under the framework established by the federal [[Occupational Safety and Health Act]] of 1970 (OSH Act). 

The [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] (OSHA) within the U.S. Department of Labor is responsible for issuing and enforcing regulations covering workplace safety. 

The [[Department of Transportation]] is responsible for transportation safety and for maintaining the list of hazardous materials.

The [[Environmental Protection Agency]] is responsible for maintaining lists of specific hazardous materials.

=== EPA ===

Environmental health and safety outside the workplace is established by the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA), which is managed by the EPA and various state and local government agencies.
* [http://www.epa.gov/epahome/r2k.htm Learn about Your Right to Know]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/epahome/r2k.htm|title=Learn about Your Right to Know|publisher=United States Environmental Protection Agency}}&lt;/ref&gt;

State and local agencies maintain [[epidemiology]] information required by physicians to evaluate environmental illness.

Air quality information must be provided by pest control supervisors under license requirements established by the [[Worker Protection Standard]] when [[restricted use pesticide]] is applied.

The list of restricted use pesticides is maintained by the US EPA.
* [http://www.epa.gov/opprd001/rup/ Restricted Use Products (RUP) Report]&lt;ref name="epa.gov"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/opprd001/rup/|title=Restricted Use Products (RUP) Report|publisher=United States Environmental Protection Agency}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, specific environmental pollutants are identified in public law, which extends to all hazardous substances even if the item is not identified as a restricted use pesticide by the EPA. As an example, [[cyfluthrin]], [[cypermethrin]], and cynoff contain cyanide, which is one of the most toxic known substances, but some of the products that contain these chemicals may not be identified as restricted-use pesticides.
* [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/7412- Title 42 U.S.C. Section 7412 identifies the list of environmental pollutants.]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/7412-|title=Title 42 U.S.C. Section 7412.|publisher=Cornell School of Law}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some specific chemicals, such as cyaniate, cyanide, cyano, and [[nitrile]] compounds, satisfy the specific hazard definition that is identified in public law regardless of whether or not the item is identified on the list of restricted use pesticides maintained by the United States Environmental Protection Agency.
* [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/7413- Title 42 U.S.C. Section 7413 contains the reporting requirement for environmental pollutants.]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/7413-|title=Title 42 U.S.C. Section 7413.|publisher=Cornell School of Law}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most developed countries have similar regulatory practices. [http://www.eea.europa.eu/ Pesticides and insecticides interests in the European Union are managed by the European Environmental Protection Agency.]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eea.europa.eu/|title=European Environmental Protection Agency|publisher=European Environmental Protection Agency}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Environmental illness share characteristics with common diseases. For example, cyanide exposure symptoms include weakness, headache, nausea, confusion, dizziness, seizures, cardiac arrest, and unconsciousness.&lt;ref name="Pesticide User's Guide"/&gt;&lt;ref name="The Facts About Cyanides"/&gt; [[Influenza]] and [[heart disease]] include the same symptoms.

Failure to obtain proper disclosure that is required by physicians will result in improper, ineffective, or delayed medical diagnosis and treatment for environmental illness caused by exposure to hazardous substance and by exposure to radiation.

===DOT===

The [https://web.archive.org/web/20120216045958/http://phmsa.dot.gov/hazmat/library Library Pipeline and Hazardous Material Safety Administration within the Department of Transportation] is responsible for maintaining the list of hazardous materials within the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.phmsa.dot.gov/hazmat/library|title=Library|publisher=Pipeline and Hazardous Material Safety Administration; Department of Transportation|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120216045958/http://phmsa.dot.gov/hazmat/library|archivedate=2012-02-16|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All hazardous materials that are not created at the work site must be transported by motor vehicle. The safety and security of the public transportation system is enforced by Department of Transportation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fmcsa.dot.gov/safety-security/safety-security.htm|title=Safety and Security|publisher=Department of Transportation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Department of Transportation]] regulates mandatory labeling requirements for all [[hazardous materials]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fmcsa.dot.gov/safety-security/hazmat/complyhmregs.htm|title=How to Comply with Federal Hazardous Materials Regulations|publisher=Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration; Department of Transportation}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is in addition to requirements by other federal agencies, like the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]], and [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]].

DOT is responsible for enforcement actions and public notification regarding hazardous chemical releases and exposures, including incidents involving federal workers. 
* [http://www.fmcsa.dot.gov/safety-security/hazmat/complyhmregs.htm How to Comply with Federal Hazardous Materials Regulations]

DOT requires that all buildings and vehicles containing hazardous materials must have signs that disclose specific types of hazards for [[certified first responder]].

===DOE===

Safety of certain workers is governed by the Department of Energy, such as mine workers. Public information can be obtained in the form of directives.
* [https://www.directives.doe.gov/ Department of Energy Directives]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.directives.doe.gov/|title=Departmental Directives|publisher=Department of Energy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===DOD===

The [[United States Department of Defense]] manages environmental safety independent of OSHA and EPA. Spills, mishaps, illnesses, and injuries are not normally handled in accordance with local, state, and federal law.

Failure to administer discipline for illegal activity occurring within a military command is considered to be '''[[dereliction of duty]]''', which is administered under the '''[[Uniform Code of Military Justice]]'''.

Individuals with information about environmental crimes and individuals with environmental injuries involving the military should become familiar with the topic of [[Whistleblower protection in United States]]. Government employees, government contractors, and military officers often lack the training, education, licensing, and experience required to understand the legal requirements involving environmental safety. The sophistication required to understand legal requirements is not normally required for promotion and contractor selection within the military.

Because of this, specific rules are documented in orders and directives that need to be written in plain language intended to be understood by people that have a 4th grade reading ability.

Law are enforced by the [[commanding officer]] in military organizations. The commanding officer typically has the ability to read and understand written requirements. A [[Flag Officer]] is subject to [[Court-martial]] action if laws or government policies are violated under their command when the activity is outside the scope of '''mission orders''' and '''[[rules of engagement]]'''. Each commanding officer is responsible for writing and maintaining policies simple enough to be understood by everyone in their command. Each commanding officer is responsible for ensuring that command policy documents are made available to every person in their command (civilian, military, and contractor). The commanding officer is responsible for disciplinary action and public disclosures when policies are violated within their command. 

The commanding officer shares responsibilities for crimes that are not punished (dereliction).

Military agencies operate independently of law enforcement, judicial authority, and [[common law]]. Similar exemptions exist for some state agencies.

Potential crimes are investigated by [[Military_police#United_States|military police]]. The following is an example of the kinds of policy documents used to conduct criminal investigations.
* [http://www.ig.navy.mil/Documents/Investigations%20Manual%20(word)/Investigations%20Manual.pdf Naval Inspector General; Investigations Manual]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ig.navy.mil/Documents/Investigations%20Manual%20(word)/Investigations%20Manual.pdf|title=Naval Inspector General; Investigations Manual|publisher=Office of the Inspector General, U.S. Department of the Navy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because military law enforcement is performed with no independent civilian oversight, there is an inherent '''[[conflict of interest]]'''. Information and disclosures are obtained through Freedom of Information Act request and not through disclosures ordinarily associated with the EPA and OSHA that have the competency required for training, certification, disclosure, and enforcement. This prevents physicians from obtaining the kind of information needed to diagnose and treat environmental illness, so the root cause for environmental illness typically remains permanently unknown. The following organization may help when the root cause for an illness remains unknown longer than 30 days.

Criminal violations, injuries, and potential enforcement actions begin by exchanging information in the following venues when civilian government employees and flag officers are unable to deal with the situation in an ethical manner.
* [[Labor unions in the United States|Local labor union officials]]
* [[Freedom of information in the United States]]

* [[United States Secretary of Defense]]
* [[President of the United States]]
* [[United States Secretary of State]]
* [[United States House of Representatives]]
* [[United States Senate]]

US federal laws, state laws, local laws, foreign laws, and treaty agreements may not apply. 

Policies are established by [[Executive order (United States)|Executive Order]] and not public law, except for interventions by the [[United States Congress]] and interventions by US district courts.

The information described in this section is for the United States, but most countries have similar regulatory requirements.

Two mandatory documents must provide hazard information for most toxic products.
* Product Label
* [[Material Safety Data Sheet]]

Product label requirements are established by the [[Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act]] under the authority of the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]]. As a minimum this requires information about the chemical makeup of the product, instructions required for the safe use of the product, and contact information for the manufacturer of the product.
* [http://www.access.gpo.gov/nara/cfr/waisidx_02/40cfrv20_02.html Title 40 CFR --Protection of Environment (parts 150 to 189) CHAPTER I--ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.access.gpo.gov/nara/cfr/waisidx_02/40cfrv20_02.html|title=Title 40 CFR --Protection of Environment (parts 150 to 189) CHAPTER I--ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY|publisher=United States Government Printing Office}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[Material Safety Data Sheet]] is required under the authority of the United States [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] for hazardous materials to communicate health and safety risks needed by health care professionals and emergency responders.

A summary of workers rights is available from [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration|OSHA]].
* [http://www.osha.gov/Publications/osha3021.pdf EmployeeWorkplace Rights]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.osha.gov/Publications/osha3021.pdf|title=EmployeeWorkplace Rights|publisher=Occupational Safety and Health Administration}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chemical information is most frequently associated with the right to know but there are many other types of information that are important to workplace safety and health. The following sources of information are those most likely to be found at the workplace or in state or federal agencies with jurisdiction over the workplace:
*Injury and illness records which employers are required to keep.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.osha.gov/pls/oshaweb/owadisp.show_document?p_table=STANDARDS&amp;p_id=10027|title=Access to employee exposure and medical records|publisher=Occupational Health and Safety Administration}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Accident investigation reports.
*Workers’ compensation claim forms and records.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dol.gov/dol/topic/workcomp/index.htm|title=Federal Workers Compensation|publisher=United States Department of Labor}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dol.gov/owcp/dfec/regs/compliance/wc.htm|title=State Workers Compensation|publisher=United States Department of Labor}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Material safety data sheets (MSDS) and labels for hazardous chemicals used or present in the workplace.
*Chemical inventories required by federal and state regulations.
*Records of monitoring and measurement of worker exposure to chemicals, noise, radiation, or other hazards.
*Workplace inspection reports, whether done by a safety committee, employer safety and health personnel, OR-OSHA insurance carriers, fire departments, or other outside agencies.
*Job safety analysis, including ergonomic evaluations of jobs or workstations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/iaq/pubs/sbs.html|title=Sick Building Syndrome|publisher=Environmental Protection Agency}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Employee medical records or studies or evaluations based on these records.
*OSHA standards and the background data on which they are based.

==== Hazard Communication (HazCom 2012) ====
'''''Note:''' Refer to 29 CFR 1910.1200 for the most current and updated information'' (https://www.osha.gov/pls/oshaweb/owadisp.show_document?p_table=standards&amp;p_id=10099)

The '''[[Hazard Communication Standard]]'''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.osha.gov/pls/oshaweb/owadisp.show_document?p_table=STANDARDS&amp;p_id=10099 HazCom] (29 CFR1910.1200)&lt;/ref&gt; first went into effect in 1985 and has since been expanded to cover almost all workplaces under OSHA jurisdiction. The details of the Hazard Communication standard are rather complicated, but the basic idea behind it is straightforward. It requires chemical manufacturers and employers to communicate information to workers about the hazards of workplace chemicals or products, including training.

The Hazard Communication standard does not specify how much training a worker must receive. Instead, it defines what the training must cover. Employers must conduct training in a language comprehensible to employees to be in compliance with the standard. It also states that workers must be trained at the time of initial assignment and whenever a new hazard is introduced into their work area. The purpose for this is so that workers can understand the hazards they face and so that they are aware of the protective measures that should be in place.
It is very difficult to get a good understanding of chemical hazards and particularly to be able to read MSDSs in the short amount of time that many companies devote to hazard communication training. When OSHA conducts an inspection, the inspector will evaluate the effectiveness of the training by reviewing records of what training was done and by interviewing employees who use chemicals to find out what they understand about the hazards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.osha.gov/pls/oshaweb/owadisp.show_document?p_table=standards&amp;p_id=10099|title=Toxic and Hazardous Substances; Hazard Communication|publisher=United States Department of Labor; Occupational Health and Safety Administration}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United States Department of Transportation]] (DOT) regulates hazmat transportation within the territory of the US by ''[[Title 49 of the Code of Federal Regulations]]''.&lt;ref name="49FR"&gt;{{cite web|title=49 FR|url=http://hazmat.dot.gov/regs/rules.htm|publisher=[[United States Department of Transportation]]|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080519000918/http://hazmat.dot.gov/regs/rules.htm|archivedate=2008-05-19|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Dangerous Goods]]

All chemical manufacturers and importers must assess the hazards of the chemicals they produce and import and pass this information on to transportation workers and purchasers through labels and [[material safety data sheets]] (MSDSs). Employers whose employees may be exposed to hazardous chemicals on the job must provide hazardous chemical information to those employees through the use of MSDSs, properly labeled containers, training, and a written hazard communication program. This standard also requires the employer to maintain a list of all hazardous chemicals used in the workplace. The MSDSs for these chemicals must be kept current and they must be made available and accessible to employees in their work areas.

Chemicals that may pose health risks or those that are physical hazards (such as fire or explosion) are covered. List of chemicals that are considered hazardous are maintained according to the use or purpose. There are several existing sources that manufacturers and employers may consult. These include:
*Any substance for which OSHA has a standard in force, including any substance listed in the Air Contaminants regulation.
*Substances listed as [[carcinogens]] (causing cancer) by the [[National Toxicology Program]] (NTP) or the [[International Agency for Research on Cancer]] (IARC).
*Substances listed in the Threshold Limit Values for Chemical Substances and Physical Agents, published by the [[American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists]] (ACGIH).
*[http://www.epa.gov/opprd001/rup/ Restricted Use Products (RUP) Report; EPA]&lt;ref name="epa.gov"/&gt;

Ultimately, it is up to the manufacturer to disclose hazards.

There are other sources of information about chemicals used in industry as a result of state and federal laws regarding the Community Right to Know Act. 

The [http://www.arb.ca.gov/capcoa/roster.htm Air Resources Board] is responsible for public hazard disclosures in California.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arb.ca.gov/capcoa/roster.htm|title=California Local Air District Directory|publisher=California}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pesticide use disclosures are made by each pest control supervisor to the County Agricultural Commission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cdpr.ca.gov/docs/county/comenu.htm/|title=County Agricultural Commissioner Resources|publisher=California Department of Pesticide Regulation|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120306064229/http://cdpr.ca.gov/docs/county/comenu.htm|archivedate=2012-03-06|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Epidemiology]] information is available from the [http://calpip.cdpr.ca.gov/ California Pesticide Information Portal], which can be used by health care professionals to identify the cause for environmental illness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://calpip.cdpr.ca.gov/|title=California Pesticide Information Portal|publisher=California}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the Oregon Community Right to Know Act (ORS 453.307-372) and the federal Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act (SARA) Title III, the Office of the State [[Fire Marshal]] collects information on hazardous substances and makes it available to emergency responders and to the general public. Among the information which companies must report are:
*Inventories of amounts and types of hazardous substances stored in their facilities.
*Annual inventories of toxic chemicals released during normal operations.
*Emergency notification of accidental releases of certain chemicals listed by the Environmental Protection Agency.
The information can be obtained in the form of an annual report of releases for the state or for specific companies. It is available on request from the Fire Marshal’s Office and is normally free of charge unless unusually large quantities of data are involved.

==== Chemical labeling requirements ====
Each container that contains a hazardous chemical must be labeled by the manufacturer or distributor before it is sent to downstream users. There is no single standard format for labels. Each product must be labeled according to the specific type of hazard.

Pesticide and fungicide labeling is regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/oppfead1/labeling/lrm/|title=Label Review Manual - Table of Contents|publisher=Environmental Protection Agency}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The identity of the hazardous chemical(s) by common or chemical name.
*Appropriate hazard warnings.
*The name and address of the manufacturer, distributor, or the responsible party.
*Product use instructions

Your employer is required to inform you of:
*The requirements of the Hazard Communication rules.
*The operations in your work area where hazardous materials are present.
*The location of the written hazard communication program, the list of hazardous chemicals, and the MSDSs of chemicals that you will be exposed to.
In addition, these items must be covered in training:
*Methods to detect the presence of hazardous chemicals.
*Physical and health hazards of the chemicals.
*Protective measures, including work practices, ventilation, personal protective equipment, and emergency procedures.
*How to read and understand labels and MSDSs.
*The hazards of non-routine tasks, such as the cleaning of tanks or other vessels, or breaking into lines containing chemicals.

==== Safety Data Sheet (SDS): ''Formerly known as Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) as per OSHA's Hazard Communication Standard'' ====
Note: Refer to 29 CFR 1910.1200 for the most current and updated information (https://www.osha.gov/pls/oshaweb/owadisp.show_document?p_table=standards&amp;p_id=10099)

[[MSDS]]s are often hard to figure out, even for trained safety professionals. MSDS information is required by EPA, OSHA, DOT, and/or DOE regulations depending upon the type of hazardous substance. The Material Safety Data Sheet includes the following information.
#Product identity and ingredients by chemical or common name.
#Physical and chemical characteristics.
#Physical hazards, such as fire and explosion.
#Health hazards, including symptoms.
#Primary routes of entry of the chemical into the body.
#Legal exposure limits (OSHA and other recommended limits).
#Whether the chemical can cause cancer.
#Precautions for safe handling and use.
#Control measures, including ventilation, personal protective equipment, etc.
#Emergency and first aid procedures.
#The date the MSDS was prepared.
#Name, address, and phone number of the manufacturer.
#Regulatory agencies, such as [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] EPA SARA Title III rules [[EPCRA]]

Chemical manufacturers may legally withhold the specific chemical identity of a material from the MSDS and label in the case of bona fide trade secrets. In such cases the following rules apply:
*The MSDS must indicate that trade secret information is being withheld.
*The MSDS must disclose information concerning the properties and effects of the hazardous chemical, even if the actual chemical identity is withheld.
*The trade secret information must be disclosed to a doctor or nurse in a medical emergency.
*In non-emergency cases health professionals can obtain a trade secret chemical identity if they can show they need it for purposes of health protection and if they sign a confidentiality agreement.

==== Exposure records ====
The Hazard Communication standard requires that chemical information must be transmitted to employees who work with hazardous materials. Employee exposure records can tell if a worker is actually being exposed to a chemical or physical hazard and how much exposure he or she is receiving.  OSHA regulations that establish access rights to these records are found in [http://www.osha.gov/pls/oshaweb/owadisp.show_document?p_table=STANDARDS&amp;p_id=10027 29 CFR 1910.1020: Access to Medical and Exposure Records].&lt;ref name="OSHA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.osha.gov/pls/oshaweb/owadisp.show_document?p_table=STANDARDS&amp;p_id=10027|title=Toxic and Hazardous Substances; Access to employee exposure and medical records|publisher=OSHA}}&lt;/ref&gt; This information is usually the product of some type of monitoring or measurement for:
*Dusts, fumes, or gases in the air.
*Absorption of a chemical into the body, e.g. blood lead levels.
*Noise exposure.
*Radiation exposure.
*Spores, fungi, or other biological contaminants.

Employees and their designated representatives have the right under OR-OSHA regulations to examine or copy exposure records that are in the possession of the employer. This right applies not only to records of an employee’s own exposure to chemical, physical, or biological agents but also to exposure records of other employees whose working conditions are similar to the employee’s. Union representatives have the right to see records for any work areas in which the union represents employees.

In addition to seeing the results, employees and their representatives also have the right to observe the actual measurement of hazardous chemical or noise exposure.

Exposure records that are part of an OR-OSHA inspection file are also accessible to employees and union representatives. In fact these files, with the exception of certain confidential information, are open to the public after the inspection has been legally closed out.

==== Medical record ====
Many employers keep some type of [[medical record]]s. These could be medical questionnaires, results of pre-employment physical examinations, results from blood tests or more elaborate records of ongoing diagnosis or treatment (such as all biological monitoring not defined as an employee exposure record). OSHA regulations that establish access rights to these records are found in [http://www.osha.gov/pls/oshaweb/owadisp.show_document?p_table=STANDARDS&amp;p_id=10027 29 CFR 1910.1020: Access to Medical and Exposure Records].&lt;ref name="OSHA"/&gt;

Medical records are considerably more personal than exposure records or accident reports so the rules governing confidentiality and access to them are stricter. Employee medical records do not include a lot of employee medical information because of this extra scrutiny. A good rule of thumb is that if the information is maintained separately from the employer's medical program, it probably will not be accessible.

Examples of separately maintained medical information would be records of voluntary employee assistance programs (alcohol, drug abuse, or personal counseling programs), medical records concerning health insurance claims or records created solely in preparation for litigation.

These records are often kept at the worksite if there is an on-site physician or nurse. They could also be in the files of a physician, clinic, or hospital with whom the employer contracts for medical services.

An employee has access to his or her own medical record (29 CFR 1910.1020). An individual employee may also sign a written release authorizing a designated representative (such as a union representative) to receive access to his or her medical record. The latter might occur in a case where the union or a physician or other researcher working for the union or employer needs medical information on a whole group of workers to document a health problem. Certain confidential information may be deleted from an employee’s record before it is released.

==Past and future==
The push towards a greater availability of information came from events killed many and infected others with toxins, such as the [[Bhopal disaster]] in India in December 1984. During the Bhopal disaster, a cloud of [[methyl isocyanate]] escaped an insecticide plant due to neglect, and as a result, 2,000 people were killed and many more were injured. The plant had been already noted for their poor safety record and lack of evacuation or emergency plan. The lack of awareness and knowledge in the community about the dangers led to this disaster, which could have been avoided.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.umass.edu/sts/ethics/bhopal.html|title=IDEESE: Cases - Bhopal Plant Disaster|publisher=University of Massachusetts, Amherst}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly after, the Emergency Planning and Right to Know Act of 1986, originally introduced by California Democrat [[Henry Waxman]], was passed. This act was the first official step taken to helping people become more educated in the field of corporation's pollutants and their actions. The act issued a requirement for industrial facilities across the U.S. to disclose information on their annual releases of toxic chemicals. This data collected is made available by the Environmental Protection Agency in the Toxics Release Inventory (TRI) which is open to public knowledge. This was noticed as a step in the right direction however, only pounds of individual pollutants were required to be released as a result of this act. No information about toxicity, spread, or overlap had been required to be shared with the public.

In years to come, the public would achieve greater ways of accessing the information that corporations with excess pollutants withheld. The Toxic 100 is a form of newer information which is a list that includes one hundred companies industrial air polluters in the United States that are ranked by the quantity of pollution they produce and the toxicity of the pollutants. This data is determined by the [[Political Economy Research Institute]] (PERI) and calculated with factors such as winds caring the pollution, height of smokestacks, and how much it impacts nearby communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.peri.umass.edu/toxic100/|title=Toxic 100|publisher=Public Economy Research Institute, University of Massachusetts}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Linder and Bob Marx 1982.JPG|250px|thumbnail|right|In the left Bob Marx with the Israeli marine archaeologist [[Elisha Linder]]]]
'''Robert F. Marx''' (born December 8, 1933) is one of the pioneer American [[Scuba diving|scuba divers]] and is best known for his work with [[shipwrecks]] and sunken [[treasure]]. Although he is considered controversial for his frequent and successful forays into [[treasure hunting]], fellow treasure hunter [[E. Lee Spence]] describes Marx as the ''true father of underwater archaeology''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldcatlibraries.org/oclc/2846435&amp;referer=brief_results ''Spence's Guide to South Carolina : diving, 639 shipwrecks (1520-1813), saltwater sport fishing, recreational shrimping, crabbing, oystering, clamming, saltwater aquarium, 136 campgrounds, 281 boat landings'' by [[E. Lee Spence]],  (Nelson Southern Printing, Sullivan's Island, S.C.: Spence, ©1976)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==

Marx became a diving specialist in the [[United States Marine Corps]] in 1953. He has since made over 5,000 dives&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.divessi.com/platinumpro/pp5000_individual.cfm?primary=752 PlatinumPro 5000 Diver web site] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071111105002/http://www.divessi.com/platinumpro/pp5000_individual.cfm?primary=752 |date=2007-11-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and has authored over 800 reports/articles and 59 books on history, archaeology, shipwrecks and exploration.&lt;ref name="RS Operations LLC web site"&gt;[http://www.rsoperations.com/Personnel/Bob_Marx/RobertMarx.htm RS Operations LLC web site] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070128184320/http://www.rsoperations.com/Personnel/Bob_Marx/RobertMarx.htm |date=2007-01-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Marx and his wife, Jenifer, live in [[Indialantic]], [[Florida]]. They are co-authors of several [[non-fiction]] books.

He was a founding member of the Council on Underwater Archaeology and of the [[Sea Research Society]] and served on the Society's Board of Advisors. In 1972 he participated in the creation of the research/professional degree of Doctor of Marine Histories.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shipwrecks.com Sea Research Society web site]&lt;/ref&gt;

Marx was made a Knight-commander in the [[Order of Isabella the Catholic]] by the [[Spain|Spanish]] government for his re-enactment in the ''Niña II'' of [[Christopher Columbus]]' first voyage of exploration.

==White gods==
Marx has written extensively about the concept of [[White Gods]]. Marx came to the conclusion that White Gods "figure in almost every indigenous culture in the Americas."&lt;ref&gt;http://articles.latimes.com/1992-01-22/news/vw-383_1_great-white-god&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robert Marx, In quest of the great white gods: contact between the Old and New World from the dawn of history, Crown, 1992&lt;/ref&gt; A review by [[Jonathan Kirsch]] in the Los Angeles Times concluded that "Quest" is a good yarn, but Marx tries hard to dress it up as something slightly scandalous. In that sense, "Quest" is the archeological equivalent of Oliver Stone's "JFK"—Marx seeks to prove the existence of "great white gods" by offering us a haphazard collection of oddities, rumors and coincidences, but what's on display here is really nothing more than the passions and obsessions of a born showman."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kirsch|first1=Jonathan|title=BOOK REVIEW : Memoir Masquerades as History in 'Quest of Great White Gods'|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1992-01-22/news/vw-383_1_great-white-god|accessdate=7 June 2014|publisher=Los Angeles Times|date=January 22, 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Salus-Grady libel law''', also known as the '''Pennsylvania anti-cartoon law''', was enacted by the [[Commonwealth of Pennsylvania]] in 1903 to discourage political criticism from the [[news media|press]]. Governor [[Samuel W. Pennypacker]] championed the controversial law in response to an ongoing set of cartoons that mocked his successful 1902 gubernatorial campaign and his tenure as governor. Upset by being caricatured as a parrot, Pennypacker denounced what he deemed "the sensational devices and the disregard of truth" employed by the press.&lt;ref name="Lamb"&gt;{{cite book | last = Lamb| first = Chris| authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Drawn to Extremes: The Use and Abuse of Editorial Cartoons| publisher = Columbia University Press| series = | volume = | edition = | date = 2004| location = New York| pages = 73–77| language = | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=LxCtgSAuXM0C&amp;pg=PA246| doi = | id = | isbn = | mr = | zbl = | jfm = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dorman"&gt;{{cite web | last = Dorman| first = Dana| authorlink = | coauthors = | title = When Cartoonists Were Criminals| work = | publisher = Historical Society of Pennsylvania| date = 3 September 2014| url = http://hsp.org/blogs/fondly-pennsylvania/when-cartoonists-were-criminals| format = | doi = | accessdate = 16 December 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Text"&gt;{{cite act |title= To authorize civil actions for the recovery of damages arising from newspaper publications negligently made... |number= 265|language= |date= 12 May 1903|article= |url= https://archive.org/details/368423-pennsylvanias-1903-anti-cartoon-law|accessdate= 16 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The law broadened the circumstances under which a newspaper could be sued for [[libel]], and made editors liable in their personal capacity to such lawsuits. Rather than having the [[chilling effect]] Pennypacker desired, the law backfired spectacularly. [[Charles Nelan]] and other artists drew cartoons more contemptuous than the previous ones, and nationally circulating newspapers  joined the Pennsylvanian newspapers in protesting against the law.&lt;ref name="Piott"&gt;{{cite journal | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = The Right of the Cartoonist: Samuel Pennypacker and Freedom of the Press| journal = Pennsylvania History: A Journal of Mid-Atlantic Studies| volume = 55| issue = 2| pages = 78–91| publisher = Science Press| location = Ephrata| date = April 1988| language = | url = https://journals.psu.edu/phj/article/view/24685/24454| jstor = | issn = | doi = | id = | mr = | zbl = | jfm = | accessdate = 16 December 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The law languished along with Pennypacker when he stepped down from office in 1907, as his successor quickly repealed the controversial measure.&lt;ref name="Dorman"/&gt;
 
==Background==
The start of the 20th century coincided with an increasingly vocal press and journalists who targeted their subjects with editorial cartoons and investigative reports.&lt;ref name="Piott"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lamb"/&gt;{{rp|72}} Feeling threatened, politicians in several states proposed laws that would place restrictions upon these unflattering images.&lt;ref name="Dewey"&gt;{{cite book | last = Dewey| first = Donald| authorlink = | coauthors = | title = The Art of Ill Will: The Story of American Political Cartoons| publisher = New York University Press| series = | volume = | edition = | date = 2007| location = New York| pages = 37| language = | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=vNI9046BaRAC&amp;pg=PA37| doi = | id = | isbn = | mr = | zbl = | jfm = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The conflict between journalist and political figure would come to a head in Pennsylvania when the Republican Party nominated Samuel W. Pennypacker, then a sitting judge in Philadelphia, for the office of governor. Pennypacker's short temper and arrogance made him an easy target. Although he was perceived as an honest judge, Pennypacker refused to acknowledge the corruption present in Pennsylvania's political environment, declaring that the government had "no ills that are worthy of mention." Pennypacker strongly defended the [[party boss]], [[Matthew S. Quay]], and attributed his nomination not to Quay's behind-the-scenes maneuvering, but to the strength of his own record as a judge. He saw his own nomination as an unprecedented achievement of honest politics.&lt;ref name="Piott"/&gt;
[[File:Polly Got a Cracker - Nelan 1903.jpg|thumb|"Polly Got a Cracker" (May 16, 1903): Nelan depicts Pennypacker as a parrot, startled by an exploding firecracker of "public opinion."]]
[[Charles Nelan]], a cartoonist working for the anti-Quay ''[[North American]]'' newspaper out of Philadelphia, capitalized on the candidate's remarks by drawing him as a conceited parrot. Referencing the parrot's propensity for [[talking bird|mimicry]], the caricatured bird repeated the words of party elders: metaphorically, Nelan accused Pennypacker of being a rubber stamp for the desires of Quay and his cronies. Later cartoons similarly implied that the judge was tainted by his association with Quay, but Pennypacker won the governor's race anyway.&lt;ref name="Piott"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Dorman"/&gt; Despite his victory, Pennypacker harbored ill will against the cartoonists, with his inaugural address criticizing "sensational journals" as a "terror to the household, a detriment to the public service, and an impediment to the courts of justice."&lt;ref name="philly.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.philly.com/philly/opinion/20160131_A_Pennsylvania_battle_waged_in_ink.html#5DVhkqcmwaISFWVA.99|title=A Pennsylvania battle waged in ink|work=philly-archives}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Salus-Grady libel law was preceded by an unsuccessful bill&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Frederick Taylor Pusey| work = | publisher = Historical Society of Pennsylvania| date = | url = http://digitalhistory.hsp.org/hint/politics-graphic-detail/person/frederick-taylor-pusey| format = | doi = | accessdate = 28 April 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; introduced by [[Frederick Taylor Pusey]] to ban "any cartoon or caricature or picture portraying, describing or representing any person, either by distortion, innuendo or otherwise, in the form or likeness of beast, bird, fish, insect, or other unhuman animal, thereby tending to expose such person to public hatred, contempt, or ridicule." But the legislators did not count on the ingenuity of the cartoonists who immediately began ridiculing Governor Pennypacker and other officials with caricatures in the guise of vegetables and inanimate objects. Politicians were depicted as turnips, trees, chestnut burrs, squash, beer steins, and other non-animal forms. Philadelphia's ''North American'' newspaper proposed a new coat of arms for Pennsylvania featuring an impaled cartoonist's head, a gag and muzzle, a dwarf on a stool, a pussy cat, and a jackass in knee-high boots.&lt;ref name="philly.com"/&gt; State representative [[Samuel W. Salus]] and state senator [[John C. Grady]] took a different approach, proposing that newspaper editors be made liable in their personal capacity to libel lawsuits, and their bill was passed.&lt;ref name="Piott"/&gt; The law was never enforced, and Pennypacker was hounded for his entire term as governor by critical cartoons.  After his predecessor's term was finished, the new administration of Governor [[Edwin Sydney Stuart]] swiftly rescinded the law.{{Citation needed|date = April 2016}}

Control of alignment and grade during [[construction]] is established through the use of '''survey stakes'''. Stakes are generally made of wood in different sizes. Based on the use of the stake they are called ''alignment stakes, offset stakes, grade stakes, and slope stakes''.

Survey stakes are markers surveyors use in surveying projects to prepare job sites, mark out property boundaries, and provide information about claims on natural resources like timber and minerals. They can be made from wood, metal, plastic, and other materials and typically come in a range of sizes and colors for different purposes. Sources can include surveying and construction suppliers, and people can also make or order their own for custom applications.

A survey stake is typically small, with a pointed end to make it easy to drive into the earth. It may be color-coded or have a space for people to write information on the stake. Surveyors use stakes when assessing sites to mark out boundaries, record data, and convey information to other people. On a job site, for example, survey stakes indicate where it is necessary to [[backfill]] with soil to raise the elevation, or to cut soil away to lower it. Stakes can also provide information about slope and grading for people getting a job site ready for construction.

{{Reading}}
 
"[[Phonics]]" emphasizes the [[alphabetic principle]] – the idea that letters represent the sounds of speech, and that there are systematic and predictable relationships between written letters and spoken words, which is specific to the [[alphabetic]] [[writing system]] Children learn letter sounds (b = the first sound in "bat" and "ball") first and then blend them (bl = the first two sounds in "blue") to form words.  Children also learn how to segment and chunk letter sounds together in order to blend them to form words (trap = /t/, /r/, /a/, /p/ or /tr/, /ap/).  

"[[Whole language]]" is a [[Reading education|method of teaching reading]] that emphasizes literature and text comprehension. Students are taught to use critical thinking strategies and to use context to "guess" words that they do not recognize. In the younger grades, children use invented spelling to write their own stories. 

Both instructional methods use elements that are emphasized in the other; the differences between the methods are largely related to what is emphasized and the sequence of skill instruction.

==Phonics==
{{Main|Phonics}}

Phonics is seen to be an improvement  used method of learning the approximate [[phoneme|sounds]] represented by [[letter (alphabet)|letter]]s (b=buh) first and then blending them with other sounds (bl=bluh) to decode and encode words in written form. This newer method attempts to eliminate the extraneous "uh" sounds which were unavoidable in the older method. Children also learn strategies to figure out words they don't know. 

Phonics is considered an "analytical" approach where students analyze the letters, letter combinations and syllables in a word; in an effort to "decode" (1) the speech-sounds represented by the letters and (2) the meaning of the text. The advantage of phonics is that, especially for students who come to schools with large English vocabularies, it enables students to decode or "sound-out" a word they have in their speaking vocabulary. 

Phonics proponents led by [[Rudolf Flesch]] in his book ''Why Johnny Can't Read'' attacked the whole word approach because (1) it did not get students into reading children's stories that did not have carefully controlled vocabularies and (2) it theoretically required the students to memorize every word as a whole. 

Phonics advocates focus their efforts on the primary grades and emphasize the importance of students having [[phonemic awareness]], that is an understanding of the alphabetic principle that the spelling of words relates to how they sound when spoken. 

A problem with teaching the reading of English with this analytical approach is that English words do not have a one-to-one speech-sound to symbol relationship. If they did have a one-to-one relationship, reading would be easier.  In general, with a few common exceptions, the [[consonant]]s do have a one-to-one speech-sound to symbol relationship but the [[vowel]]s do not. For instance the letter "a" represents one sound in the word "s'''a'''y", a second sound in "'''a'''t", a third sound in "'''a'''ny", a fourth sound in "'''a'''re", a fifth sound in "'''a'''ll", a sixth sound in "'''a'''bout", a seventh sound in "f'''a'''ther", an eighth sound in "or'''a'''nge", and a ninth sound (silence) in "bre'''a'''d". The speech-sounds are sometimes influenced by (a) the letters surrounding the target vowel, (b) by the sentence containing the word and (c) the stress, or lack thereof, given to the syllable containing the letter. 

Almost any combination of three letters with a central "a" can reasonably be pronounced in a number of different ways. For instance the "a" in "pag" could be pronounced as in "page" (long "a"), "pageant" (short "a"), creepage (short "i") or decoupage (short "o" as in "dot"). It therefore follows that beginning students will have a difficult time picking the appropriate sound when sounding-out words which are not in their speaking vocabularies.

Fortunately, most readers quickly develop a subconscious word sense which helps them fluently pick the right sound based on the structure of the word and how that structure is related to other similar words they know.

Some very common words do not fully follow common phonic patterns, so those words have to be memorized. Some books refer to these words as "[[sight word]]s", but it is probably better to refer to them as "memory words" because some books refer to sight words as those words which are so common they do not have to be analyzed or "sounded-out". It does not seem like a good idea to have "sight-words" mean two different things when "memory-words" is available.

The many [[homonym]]s in English such as ''to'', ''too'', and ''two'' create difficulties for students, even at the university level in regard to spelling. 

'''Drawbacks''': 
*For those who learn to speak by learning the whole sound of a word, phonics is not an ideal form of reading instruction, because these learners do not naturally break words into separate sounds.
*Some phonics programs use low-interest reading material and too many boring worksheets. Those "drawbacks", of course, are not unique to a phonics program.

==Whole language==
{{Main|Whole language}}

'''Whole language''' is a currently controversial approach to teaching reading that is based on constructivist learning theory and ethnographic studies of students in classrooms. With whole language, teachers are expected to provide a literacy rich environment for their students and to combine [[Speech communication|speaking]], [[listening]], [[reading (activity)|reading]], and [[writing]]. Whole language teachers emphasize the meaning of texts over the sounds of letters, and phonics instruction becomes just one component of the whole language classroom. 
Whole language is considered a "[[wikt:top-down|top down]]" approach where the reader constructs a personal meaning for a text based on using their prior knowledge to interpret the meaning of what they are reading.

'''Drawbacks''': 
*Some whole language programs place too little emphasis on word analysis. When that is left out, young readers may guess or skip over words they don't know and some children may not learn how to read.
*Some scholars have estimated that a whole-word memorization approach puts severe limitations on the number of words that children can learn to read.&lt;ref&gt;[[Diane McGuinness|McGuinness, Diane]]. [http://www.rrf.org.uk/newsletter.php?n_ID=95 A Prototype for Teaching the English Alphabet Code] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080624011617/http://rrf.org.uk/newsletter.php?n_ID=95 |date=2008-06-24 }} Reading Reform Foundation Newsletter (49) &lt;!--accessed August 5, 2008--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Students who come from "high literacy" households—where young children are read bedtime stories on a regular basis, there are lots of children's books, and adults read regularly—tend to learn to read well regardless of the teaching approach used. These students tend to enter school with large vocabularies and reading readiness skills (and sometimes they already can read). 

Students from "low literacy" households are not exposed much to reading in their homes and tend to have smaller vocabularies. They may speak non-standard dialects of English such as [[African American Vernacular English]] and can be unmotivated students, especially if they see teachers as enemies trying to change how they speak and act, in other words their language and culture. It can be argued that a standard phonics approach might be unsuccessful for these students. Whole language approaches encourage teachers to find reading material that reflects these students' language and culture. Using culturally relevant material within classrooms may assist to engage these students in their reading. In addition, knowing students and how they learn will assist as topics of interest can be incorporated into their reading material for added motivation.

Publishing basal reading textbooks is a multimillion dollar industry that responds to the demands of purchasers. Two populous states, California and Texas, do statewide adoptions of textbooks, and whatever they want in their textbooks, publishers tend to supply. Currently publishers are including systematic phonics instruction (see [[synthetic phonics]]), more classic and popular children's literature, and whole language activities. This compromise generally goes under the rubric of a "balanced approach" to teaching reading. Advocates of balanced reading instruction should supplement a school's adopted reading program with materials that reflect the experiential background and interests of their students. 

Various approaches to reading presume that students learn differently. The phonics emphasis in reading draws heavily from behaviorist learning theory that is associated with the work of the Harvard psychologist [[B.F. Skinner]] while the whole language emphasis draws from cognitivist learning theory and the work of the Russian psychologist [[Lev Vygotsky]]. 

Behaviorist learning theory is based on studies of animal behaviors where animals such as pigeons learned to do tasks when they received rewards and extinguished (stopped) behaviors that were not rewarded or were punished. Most of us can point to things we continue to do because we are rewarded for doing them. Rewards can be the pay we get for jobs we do, desired recognition like "A" grades for doing excellent school work, and praise from our friends when they like what we are doing. Likewise, we can point to things we stopped doing because we were not rewarded or were punished for them. Behaviorist learning theory tends to look at extrinsic rewards like money, grades, and gold stars rather than intrinsic rewards like feeling good about successfully accomplishing a difficult task. 

Cognitivist learning theory is based on the idea that children learn by connecting new knowledge to previously learned knowledge. The term is a building metaphor that includes students using scaffolding to organize new information. If children cannot connect new knowledge to old knowledge in a meaningful way, they may with difficulty memorize it ([[rote learning]]), but they will not have a real understanding of what they are learning. 

Vygotsky identified a '''"[[zone of proximal development]]"''' where children can learn new things that are a little above their current understanding with the help of more knowledgeable peers or adults. This new knowledge is incorporated into their existing knowledge base.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4131">'''Telephone banking''' is a service provided by a [[bank]] or other [[financial institution]], that enables [[customer]]s to perform over the [[telephone]] a range of [[financial transaction]]s which do not involve cash or documents (such as [[cheques]]), without the need to visit a [[Branch (banking)|bank branch]] or [[automated teller machine|ATM]]. Telephone banking times are usually longer than branch opening times, and some financial institutions offer the service on a 24-hour basis. However, some banks impose restrictions on which accounts may be accessed through telephone banking and usually limit the amounts that can be transacted.

The types of financial transactions which customers may transact through telephone banking include obtaining account balances and list of latest transactions, [[electronic bill payment]]s, and [[giro|funds transfer]]s between a customer's or to another's [[deposit account|account]]s.

From the bank's point of view, telephone banking reduces the cost of handling transactions by reducing visits by customers to a bank branch for non-cash withdrawals and deposit transactions. However, the use of telephone banking services has been declining in favor of [[internet banking]] since internet banking became available in the early 2000s, and further eroded with the advent of [[mobile banking]] in the 2010s.

== History ==
Telephone banking became available in the 1980s, first introduced by [[Girobank]] in the United Kingdom, which establishing a dedicated telephone banking service in 1984.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sponsored/finance/your-bank/10912973/history-banking-early-coins-contactless.html |title=A history of banking: from coins to pings |publisher=The Telegraph |date=Jun 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Telephone banking saw growth during the 1980s and early 1990s, and was heavily used by the first generation of [[direct bank]]s. However, the development [[online banking]] in the early 2000s started a long term decline in the use of telephone banking in favor of [[internet banking]].&lt;ref&gt; Clark, Teri B. The Complete Personal Finance Handbook: Step-by-step Instructions to Take Control of Your Financial Future. Ocala, FL: Atlantic Pub. Group, 2007. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; The advent of [[mobile banking]] further eroded the use of telephone banking in the 2010s.

== Operation ==
To use a financial institution's telephone banking facility, a customer must first register with the institution for the service. They would be assigned a customer number (which is not the same as the account number) and they may be given or set up their own [[password]] (under various names) for customer verification. 

Customers would call the special phone number set up by the bank and would [[authentication|authenticate]] their identity through the customer number and a numeric or verbal password or through security questions asked by a live representative. The service can be provided using an automated system, using [[Interactive voice response|voice recognition capability]], [[Dual-tone multi-frequency signaling|DTMF]] technology or by live [[customer service]] representatives.

In [[India]], a variation of telephone banking utilizing [[missed call]] numbers, assigned to specific tasks (such as checking balances or performing money transfers), is offered by major banks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/briefly/2016/05/13/5-things-five-things-you-can-get-in-india-by-using-a-missed-call/|title=5 Things You Can Get in India With a Missed Call|last=Anand|first=Shefali|date=13 May 2016|website=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|language=en-US|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=5 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-26028381|title=Five unusual ways in which Indians use mobile phones|last=Banerjee|first=Tushar|date=12 February 2014|work=BBC News|access-date=6 October 2017|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Coming Global Superstorm''''' ({{ISBN|0-671-04190-8}}) is a 1999 book by [[Art Bell]] and [[Whitley Strieber]], which warns that [[global warming]] might produce sudden and catastrophic [[climate|climatic]] effects.

* First, the [[Gulf Stream]] and [[North Atlantic drift]] would generate a cordon of warm water around the [[North Pole]], which in turn, holds in a frozen mass of Arctic air.
* Second, if the North Atlantic drift [[Shutdown of thermohaline circulation|were to shut down]], that barrier would fail, releasing a flood of frozen air into the [[Northern Hemisphere]], causing a sudden and drastic temperature shift.

The book discusses a possible cause of the failure of the Gulf Stream: the melting of the [[polar ice cap]]s could drastically affect the [[salinity]] of the North Atlantic drift by dumping a large quantity of freshwater into the world's oceans.

Bell and Strieber explain the possibility that such current destabilizations have occurred before, as well as seemingly impossible engineering feats by the ancients. Among their examples is the island city of [[Nan Madol]]. The book claims that its construction, with exacting tolerances and extremely heavy basalt materials, necessitates a high degree of technical competency. Since no such society exists in the modern record or even, in legend, the society must have been destroyed by dramatic means.

While other explanations beside a global [[meteorological event]] are possible, a correlating evidence set is presented in the woolly mammoth. Strieber and Bell assert that since mammoths have been found preserved with food still in their mouths and undigested in their stomachs, these animals must have been killed quickly, in otherwise normal conditions. They were preserved so well by quick freezing, which is taken as evidence of a rapid onset of a global blizzard or similar event.

Interspersed with the analytical parts of the book are a series of interlinked short fictional scenarios, written in italics, describing what might transpire today if a destabilization of the North Atlantic Current were to occur. The fictional accounts of "current events" as the meteorological situation deteriorates provided background and inspiration for the 2004 science fiction film ''[[The Day After Tomorrow]]''. Indeed, some events from the book are portrayed in the film with little modification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2004/05/0518_040518_dayafter.html|title=National Geographic News: Day After Tomorrow Movie: Could Ice Age Occur Overnight?|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Primordial Tradition''' is a school of religious philosophy which holds its origins in the [[philosophia perennis]], or [[perennial philosophy]], which is in turn a development of the [[prisca theologia]] of the Middle Ages.&lt;ref&gt;Antoine Faivre and Karen-Claire Voss, Western Esotericism and the Science of Religions, in Numen, Vol. 42 (E. J. Brill, Leiden 1995) 50-51&lt;/ref&gt;

The Primordial Tradition seeks to establish a fundamental origin of religious belief in all authentic religious teachings, adhering to the principle that universal truths are a cross cultural phenomenon and transcendent of their respective traditions, mythologies, and religious beliefs. The idea of the Primordial Tradition was well received by both practitioners and the academic community, and its development was actively endorsed by the International Conference of Religions in Chicago, 1893&lt;ref&gt;Antoine Faivre and Karen-Claire Voss, Western Esotericism and the Science of Religions, in Numen, Vol. 42 (E. J. Brill, Leiden 1995) 56&lt;/ref&gt;

The Primordial Tradition does not elevate any tradition or religion above another and instead upholds the truth claims of all authentic religions and spiritual movements. Adherents of the Primordial Tradition can be found in any religious system such as [[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]], [[Paganism]], [[Christianity]] or [[Islam]].

By examining the foundations of religious thought as philosophical [[truth value]]s, the Primordial Tradition seeks to produce a level of wisdom or gnosis which is greater than that which would be provided by the study of a single religious system. The process utilized is similar to the study of the [[history of religions]] and [[comparative mythology]] as is found in the works of authors such as [[Mircea Eliade]]. It can also be found in the school of archetypal psychology and in the ideas of [[Carl Jung]]

Key proponents of the Primordial Tradition have included [[Rene Guenon]], [[Frithjof Schuon]], [[Julius Evola]], [[Harvey Spencer Lewis]], [[Ananda Coomaraswamy]], [[Elémire Zolla]], [[Alain Danielou]], [[Jean-Louis Michon]],  [[Gottfried Leibniz]], [[Aldous Huxley]], and [[Plato]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2015}}

The [[Traditionalist School]] bases its teachings on religious belief on the concept of a  pre-existent primordial tradition found in different religions.&lt;ref&gt;''The Unanimous Tradition, Essays on the essential unity of all religions'', by Joseph Epes Brown, Titus Burckhardt, Rama P. Coomaraswamy, Gai Eaton, Isaline B. Horner, Toshihiko Izutsu, Martin Lings, Seyyed Hossein Nasr, Lord Northbourne, Marco Pallis, Whitall N. Perry, Leo Schaya, Frithjof Schuon, Philip Sherrard, William Stoddart, Elémire Zolla, edited by Ranjit Fernando, Sri Lanka Institute of Traditional Studies, 1991 {{ISBN|955-9028-01-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Virgin and Child with St. Anne''' (Dutch: '''Sint Anna te Drieën''') is a sculpture by [[Jan van Steffeswert]] (ca. 1470–1525), a woodcarver from who worked in [[Maastricht]] in the late 15th and early 16th century. Depictions of [[Virgin and Child with Saint Anne| Christ Child with his mother and grandmother]] were popular in the late middle ages. The scene frequently shows Mary and Christ reading. In this scene however, the child is shown grasping a bowl of [[porridge]]. Due to the relatively small size and the emphasis on domesticity, it has been suggested that the sculpture had been commissioned for a home rather than a church. &lt;ref name=Mulder-Bakker&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Uitgeverij Verloren| isbn = 978-90-6550-996-3| last = Mulder-Bakker| first = Anneke B.| title = Verborgen vrouwen: kluizenaressen in de middeleeuwse stad| date = 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Diverse torture instruments.jpg|right|thumb|upright=1.15|A variety of torture instruments. Many, including the large [[Iron Maiden of Nuremberg]], were never used for torture.]]
'''Torture''' (from [[Latin language|Latin]] ''tortus'': to twist, to torment) is the act of deliberately inflicting severe physical or psychological [[suffering]] on someone by another as a punishment or in order to fulfill some desire of the torturer or force some action from the victim. Torture, by definition, is a [[mens rea|knowing and intentional act]]; deeds which unknowingly or negligently inflict suffering or pain, without a specific intent to do so are not typically considered torture.&lt;ref&gt;http://mentalfloss.com/article/23038/9-insane-torture-techniques&lt;/ref&gt;
Torture has been carried out or sanctioned by individuals, groups, and states throughout history from ancient times to modern day, and forms of torture can vary greatly in duration from only a few minutes to several days or longer. Reasons for torture can include [[punishment]], [[revenge]], political [[Brainwashing|re-education]], [[deterrence (legal)|deterrence]], [[coercion]] of the victim or a third party, [[interrogation]] to extract information or a [[confession]] irrespective of whether it is [[false confession|false]], or simply the [[Sadistic personality disorder|sadistic]] gratification of those carrying out or observing the torture. Alternatively, some forms of torture are designed to inflict [[Psychological torture|psychological pain]] or leave as little physical injury or evidence as possible while achieving the same psychological devastation. The torturer may or may not kill or injure the victim, but torture may result in a [[murder|deliberate death]] and serves as a form of [[capital punishment]]. Depending on the aim, even a form of torture that is intentionally fatal may be prolonged to allow the victim to suffer as long as possible (such as [[half-hanging]]). In other cases, the torturer may be indifferent to the condition of the victim.

Although torture is sanctioned by some states, it is prohibited under [[international law]] and the [[domestic laws]] of most countries. Although widely illegal and reviled, there is an ongoing debate as to what exactly is and is not legally defined as torture. It is a serious violation of [[human rights]], and is declared to be unacceptable (but not illegal) by Article 5 of the [[United Nations|UN]] [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]]. Signatories of the [[Geneva Conventions|Geneva Conventions of 1949]] and the [[Protocol I|Additional Protocols I]] and [[Protocol II|II]] of 8 June 1977 officially agree not to torture captured persons in [[armed conflicts]], whether international or internal. Torture is also prohibited for the signatories of the [[United Nations Convention Against Torture]], which has 163 state parties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://treaties.un.org/pages/ViewDetails.aspx?src=TREATY&amp;mtdsg_no=IV-9&amp;chapter=4&amp;lang=en |title= United Nations Treaty Collection |publisher=United Nations |accessdate=7 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

National and international legal prohibitions on torture derive from a consensus that torture and similar ill-treatment are immoral, as well as impractical, and information obtained by torture is far less reliable than that obtained by other techniques.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[Amnesty International]] |url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/library/info/ACT40/014/2005/en |title=Torture and Ill-Treatment in the 'War on Terror' |date=1 November 2005 |accessdate=22 October 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=general/&gt;&lt;ref name=reckoning/&gt; Despite these findings and international conventions, organizations that monitor abuses of human rights (e.g., [[Amnesty International]], the [[International Rehabilitation Council for Torture Victims]], [[Freedom from Torture]], etc.) report widespread use condoned by states in many regions of the world.&lt;ref&gt;[[Amnesty International]] [https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/pol10/001/2005/en/ Report 2005]  [https://web.archive.org/web/20070317170847/http://web.amnesty.org/report2006/2af-summary-eng Report 2006] &lt;/ref&gt; Amnesty International estimates that at least 81 world governments currently practice torture, some of them openly.&lt;ref name="Amnesty08"&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[Amnesty International]] |url=http://thereport.amnesty.org/eng/report-08-at-a-glance |title=Report 08: At a Glance |year=2008 |accessdate=22 October 2008 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080708202906/http://thereport.amnesty.org/eng/report-08-at-a-glance |archivedate = 8 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definitions==

===International level===

====UN Convention Against Torture====
The [[United Nations Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment]], which is currently in force since 26 June 1987, provides a broad definition of torture. Article 1.1 of the UN Convention Against Torture reads:
{{blockquote|For the purpose of this Convention, the term "torture" means any act by which severe [[pain]] or [[suffering]], whether physical or mental, is intentionally inflicted on a person for such purposes as obtaining from him, or a third person, information or a [[Confession (law)|confession]], punishing him for an act he or a third person has committed or is suspected of having committed, or [[intimidating]] or [[Coercion|coercing]] him or a third person, or for any reason based on discrimination of any kind, when such pain or suffering is inflicted by or at the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a [[public official]] or other person acting in an official capacity. It does not include pain or suffering arising only from, inherent in, or incidental to, lawful sanctions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/documents/ga/res/39/a39r046.htm|title=A/RES/39/46. Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment|website=un.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

This definition was restricted to apply only to nations and to government-sponsored torture and clearly limits the torture to that perpetrated, directly or indirectly, by those acting in an official capacity, such as [[government agency|government personnel]], [[law enforcement officers|law enforcement personnel]], [[medical personnel]], [[military personnel]], or [[politicians]]. It appears to exclude:
# torture perpetrated by [[gang]]s, [[hate group]]s, [[rebellion|rebel]]s, or [[terrorist]]s who ignore national or international mandates;
# random violence during war; and
# punishment allowed by national laws, even if the punishment uses techniques similar to those used by torturers such as [[mutilation]], [[flagellation|whipping]], or [[corporal punishment]] when practiced as [[criminal justice|lawful punishment]]. Some professionals in the torture rehabilitation field believe that this definition is too restrictive and that the definition of politically motivated torture should be broadened to include all acts of organized violence.&lt;ref&gt;James Jaranson, "The Science and Politics of Rehabilitating Torture Survivors," in ''Caring for Victims of Torture,'' edited by Michael K. Popkin, Amer Psychiatric Pub Inc.1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Declaration of Tokyo====

An even broader definition was used in the 1975 [[Declaration of Tokyo]] regarding the participation of medical professionals in acts of torture:

:For the purpose of this Declaration, torture is defined as the deliberate, systematic or wanton infliction of physical or mental suffering by one or more persons acting alone or on the orders of any authority, to force another person to yield information, to make a confession, or for any other reason.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wma.net/en/30publications/10policies/c18/index.html World Medical Association, ''Declaration of Tokyo,'' 1975.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111218203758/http://www.wma.net/en/30publications/10policies/c18/index.html |date=18 December 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This definition includes torture as part of [[domestic violence]] or ritualistic abuse, as well as in criminal activities.

====Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court====
The [[Rome Statute]] is the [[treaty]] that set up the [[International Criminal Court]] (ICC). The treaty was adopted at a diplomatic conference in Rome on 17 July 1998 and went into effect on 1 July 2002. The Rome Statute provides a simplest definition of torture regarding the prosecution of [[war criminals]] by the International Criminal Court. Paragraph 1 under Article 7(e) of the Rome Statute provides that:

{{quote|"Torture" means the intentional infliction of severe pain or suffering, whether physical or mental, upon a person in the custody or under the control of the accused; except that torture shall not include pain or suffering arising only from, inherent in or incidental to, lawful sanctions;&lt;ref&gt;[http://legal.un.org/icc/statute/99_corr/cstatute.htm ROME STATUTE OF THE INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL COURT], INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL COURT, 17 July 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

====Inter-American Convention to Prevent and Punish Torture====

The [[Inter-American Convention to Prevent and Punish Torture]], which is in force since 28 February 1987, defines torture more expansively than the United Nations Convention Against Torture. Article 2 of the Inter-American Convention reads:

{{quote|For the purposes of this Convention, torture shall be understood to be any act intentionally performed whereby physical or mental pain or suffering is inflicted on a person for purposes of criminal investigation, as a means of intimidation, as personal punishment, as a preventive measure, as a penalty, or for any other purpose. Torture shall also be understood to be the use of methods upon a person intended to obliterate the personality of the victim or to diminish his physical or mental capacities, even if they do not cause physical pain or mental anguish.

The concept of torture shall not include physical or mental pain or suffering that is inherent in or solely the consequence of lawful measures, provided that they do not include the performance of the acts or use of the methods referred to in this article.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1985"&gt;[http://www.oas.org/juridico/English/Treaties/a-51.html Inter-American Convention to Prevent and Punish Torture], Organization of American States, 9 December 1985.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

====Amnesty International====

Since 1973, [[Amnesty International]] has adopted the simplest, broadest definition of torture. It reads:

:Torture is the systematic and deliberate infliction of acute pain by one person on another, or on a third person, in order to accomplish the purpose of the former against the will of the latter.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/act40/001/1984/en/ Amnesty International, (1973) ''Torture in the Eighties.'' USA Edition. Amnesty International Publication.] &lt;/ref&gt;

===Municipal level===

====United States====

=====U.S. Code § 2340=====
[[Title 18 of the United States Code]] contains the definition of torture in 18 U.S.C. § 2340, which is only applicable to persons committing or attempting to commit torture outside of the United States.&lt;ref name="LGT"&gt;{{USC|18|2340A}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It reads:
{{quote|As used in this chapter—
:(1) “torture” means an act committed by a person acting under the [[color of law]] specifically intended to inflict severe physical or mental pain or suffering (other than pain or suffering incidental to lawful sanctions) upon another person within his custody or physical control;
:(2) “severe mental pain or suffering” means the prolonged mental harm caused by or resulting from—
:: (A) the intentional infliction or threatened infliction of severe physical pain or suffering;
:: (B) the administration or application, or threatened administration or application, of mind-altering substances or other procedures calculated to disrupt profoundly the senses or the personality;
:: (C) the threat of imminent death; or
:: (D) the threat that another person will imminently be subjected to death, severe physical pain or suffering, or the administration or application of mind-altering substances or other procedures calculated to disrupt profoundly the senses or personality; and
: (3) “United States” means the several [[U.S. state|states]] of the United States, the [[District of Columbia]], and the [[Commonwealth (U.S. insular area)|commonwealths]], [[Territories of the United States|territories, and possessions of the United States]].}}

In order for the United States to assume control over this jurisdiction, the alleged offender must be a U.S. national or the alleged offender must be present in the United States, irrespective of the nationality of the victim or alleged offender. Any person who conspires to commit an offense shall be subject to the same penalties (other than the penalty of death) as the penalties prescribed for an actual act or attempting to commit an act, the commission of which was the object of the conspiracy.&lt;ref name="LGT"/&gt;

=====Torture Victim Protection Act of 1991=====
The [[Torture Victim Protection Act of 1991]] provides remedies to individuals who are victims of torture by persons acting in an official capacity of any foreign nation. The definition is similar to the U.S. Code § 2340, which reads:
{{quote|(b) TORTURE.—For the purposes of this Act—
:(1) the term "torture" means any act, directed against an individual in the offender's custody or physical control, by which severe pain or suffering (other than pain or suffering arising only from or inherent in, or incidental to, lawful sanctions), whether physical or mental, is intentionally inflicted on that individual for such purposes as obtaining from that individual or a third person information or a confession, punishing that individual for an act that individual or a third person has committed or is suspected of having committed, intimidating or coercing that individual or a third person, or for any reason based on discrimination of any kind; and
:2) mental pain or suffering refers to prolonged mental harm caused by or resulting from—
::(A) the intentional infliction or threatened infliction of severe physical pain or suffering;
::(B) the administration or application, or threatened administration or application, of mind altering substances or other procedures calculated to disrupt profoundly the senses or the personality;
::(C) the threat of imminent death; or
::(D) the threat that another individual will imminently be subjected to death, severe physical pain or suffering, or the administration or application of mind-altering substances or other procedures calculated to disrupt profoundly the senses or personality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/STATUTE-106/pdf/STATUTE-106-Pg73.pdf|title=PUBLIC LAW 102-256 — MAR. 12, 1992|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==History==
{{Further information|History of human rights}}
In the study of the history of torture, some authorities rigidly divide the history of torture ''per se'' from the history of capital punishment, while noting that most forms of capital punishment are extremely painful. Torture grew into an ornate discipline, where calibrated violence served two functions: to investigate and produce confessions and to attack the body as a form of punishment. Entire populaces of towns would show up to witness an execution by torture in the public square. Those who had been "spared" torture were commonly locked barefooted into the stocks, where children took delight in rubbing feces into their hair and mouths.&lt;ref&gt;G. R. Scott, ''A History of Torture'' (London: Merchant, 1995).&lt;/ref&gt;

Deliberately painful methods of torture and execution for severe crimes were taken for granted as part of justice until the development of [[Humanism]] in [[17th century philosophy]], and "[[cruel and unusual punishment]]" came to be denounced in the [[English Bill of Rights]] of 1689. The [[Age of Enlightenment]] in the [[western world]] further developed the idea of universal [[human rights]]. The adoption of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] in 1948 marks the recognition at least nominally of a general ban of torture by all UN member states.

Its effect in practice is limited, however, as the Declaration is not ratified officially and does not have legally binding character in international law, but is rather considered part of [[customary international law]]. Several countries still practice torture today. Some countries have legally codified it, and others have claimed that it is not practiced, while maintaining the use of torture in secret.&lt;ref&gt;"Nigeria's Torture Chambers Exposed in New Report." ''Amnesty''. September. 2014. Accessed 20 July. 2017. https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2014/09/nigeria-s-torture-chambers-exposed-new-report/&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the days when Roman law prevailed throughout Europe, torture has been regarded as subtending three ''classes'' or ''degrees'' of suffering.&lt;ref&gt;A. Hirsch, ''ed.'', ''The Book of Torture and Executions'' (Toronto: Golden Books, 1944).&lt;/ref&gt; ''First-degree'' torture typically took the forms of whipping and beating but did not mutilate the body. The most prevalent modern example is [[bastinado]], a technique of beating or whipping the soles of the bare feet. ''Second-degree'' torture consisted almost entirely of crushing devices and procedures, including exceptionally clever screw presses or "bone vises" that crushed thumbs, toes, knees, feet, even teeth and skulls in a wide variety of ways. A wide array of [[Boot (torture)|"boots"]]—-machines variously and ingeniously designed to slowly crush feet—-are quite representative. Finally, ''third-degree'' tortures savagely mutilated the body in numerous dreadful ways, incorporating spikes, blades, boiling oil, and extremely carefully controlled fire. The serrated iron tongue shredder; the red-hot copper basin for destroying eyesight ([[abacination]], ''q.v.''); and the stocks that forcibly held the prisoner's naked feet, glistening with lard, directly over red-hot coals ([[foot roasting]], ''q.v.'') until the skin and foot muscles were burnt black and the bones fell to ashes are examples of torture in the third degree.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}

[[File:Flaying of rebels.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|[[Assyria]]ns skinning or flaying their prisoners alive]]
Judicial torture was probably first applied in Persia. Over time torture has been used as a means of reform, inducing public terror, interrogation, spectacle, and sadistic pleasure. The [[ancient Greeks]] and [[Ancient Romans|Romans]] used torture for interrogation. Until the 2nd century AD, torture was used only on [[slave]]s (with a few exceptions).&lt;ref&gt;Pliny the Younger. ''Epistulae'' : X.96.5: "''Hunc abstinentia sanctitate, quoad viridis aetas, vicit et fregit; novissime cum senectute ingravescentem viribus animi sustinebat, cum quidem incredibiles cruciatus et indignissima tormenta pateretur.''"&lt;/ref&gt; After this point it began to be extended to all members of the [[Proletariat|lower classes]].&lt;ref&gt;de Ste. Croix, Geoffrey Ernst Maurice. ''Christian Persecution, Martyrdom, and Orthodoxy''. 2006. New York: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; A slave's testimony was admissible ''only'' if extracted by torture, on the assumption that slaves could not be trusted to reveal the truth voluntarily. This torture occurred to break the bond between a master and his slave. Slaves were thought to be incapable of lying under torture.&lt;ref&gt;Peters, Edward. Torture. New York: Basil Blackwell Inc., 1985.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Middle Ages===

Medieval and early modern European courts used torture, depending on the crime of the accused and his or her social status. Torture was deemed a legitimate means to extract confessions or to obtain the names of accomplices or other information about a crime, although many confessions were greatly invalid due to the victim being forced to confess under great agony and pressure. It was permitted by law only if there was already [[half-proof]] against the accused.&lt;ref&gt;J. Franklin, ''The Science of Conjecture: Evidence and Probability Before Pascal''. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 2001, 26-30.&lt;/ref&gt; Torture was used in continental Europe to obtain [[corroborating evidence]] in the form of a confession when other evidence already existed.&lt;ref&gt;Langbein, John H., "Torture and Plea Bargaining" (1978). ''Faculty Scholarship Series''. Paper 543.
http://digitalcommons.law.yale.edu/fss_papers/543&lt;/ref&gt; Often, defendants already sentenced to death would be tortured to force them to disclose the names of accomplices. Torture in the [[Medieval Inquisition]] began in 1252 with a papal bull [[Ad extirpanda|Ad Extirpanda]] and ended in 1816 when another [[papal bull]] forbade its use.

A highly esteemed torture in the times of the Inquisition as a good means of interrogating "taciturn" heretics and wizards was the interrogation chair.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.torturemuseumamsterdam.com/#portfolio|title=Please visit our colleagues in Bruges!|website=torturemuseumamsterdam.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714133744/http://www.torturemuseumamsterdam.com/#portfolio|archivedate=14 July 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Torture was usually conducted in secret, in underground dungeons. By contrast, torturous executions were typically public, and woodcuts of English prisoners being [[hanged, drawn and quartered]] show large crowds of spectators, as do paintings of Spanish [[auto-da-fé]] executions, in which heretics were burned at the stake. Torture was also used during this time period as a means of reform, spectacle, to induce fear into the public, and most popularly as a punishment for treason.

Medieval torture devices were varied. One old English chronicle from the Early Medieval period reads, "They hanged them by the thumbs, or by the head, and hung fires on their feet; they put knotted strings about their heads, and writhed them so that it went to the brain ... Some they put in a chest that was short, and narrow, and shallow, and put sharp stones therein, and pressed the man therein, so that they broke all his limbs ... I neither can nor may tell all the wounds or all the tortures which they inflicted on wretched men in this land." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Bately|first= Janet M.|title= The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle: A Collaborative Edition. Vol. 3: MS. A |year= 1986| location=Cambridge |publisher=D.S. Brewer |isbn=978-0-85991-103-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tortures later in the Middle Ages consisted of whipping; the crushing of thumbs, feet, legs, and heads in iron presses; burning the flesh; and tearing out teeth, [[www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nail_(anatomy)|fingernails]], and toenails with red-hot iron forceps. Limb-smashing and drowning were also popular medieval tortures. Specific devices were also created and used during this time, including the rack, the Pear (also mentioned in Grose's Dictionary of the Vulgar Tongue (1811) as "Choak [''sic.''] Pears," and described as being "formerly used in Holland."), [[thumbscrew (torture)|thumbscrew]]s, animals like rats, the [[iron chair]], and the [[cat o nine tails]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.gutenberg.org/files/5402/5402.txt&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early modern period===
[[File:Lingchi (cropped).jpg|thumb|[[Lingchi]] – execution by [[slow slicing]] – in Beijing around 1904.]]

During the early modern period, the [[torture of witches]] took place. In 1613, [[Anton Praetorius]] described the situation of the prisoners in the dungeons in his book ''Gründlicher Bericht Von Zauberey und Zauberern'' (''Thorough Report about Sorcery and Sorcerers''). He was one of the first to protest against all means of torture.

While secular courts often treated suspects ferociously, [[Will Durant|Will]] and Ariel Durant argued in ''The Age of Faith'' that many of the most vicious procedures were inflicted upon pious [[heresy|heretics]] by even more pious friars. The [[Dominican Order|Dominicans]] gained a reputation as some of the most fearsomely innovative torturers in medieval Spain.

Torture was continued by [[Protestants]] during the [[Renaissance]] against teachers who they viewed as [[Heresy|heretics]]. In 1547 [[John Calvin]] had [[Jacques Gruet]] arrested in [[Geneva]], [[Switzerland]]. Under torture he confessed to several crimes including writing an anonymous letter left in the pulpit which threatened death to Calvin and his associates.&lt;ref name=Monter&gt;{{cite journal|last=Monter|first=E. William|title=Crime and Punishment in Calvin's Geneva, 1562|journal=Archiv für Reformationsgeschichte|year=1973|volume=64|page=282}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Council of Geneva had him beheaded with Calvin's approval.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Parker|first=T.H.L.|year=2006|title=John Calvin: A Biography|publisher=Lion Hudson plc|location=Oxford|isbn=978-0-7459-5228-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Owen"&gt;{{cite book |title=The debatable Land Between this World and the Next |last=Owen |first=Robert Dale |year=1872 |publisher=G.W.

In England the trial by [[jury]] developed considerable freedom in evaluating evidence and condemning on [[circumstantial evidence]], making torture to extort confessions unnecessary. For this reason in England a regularized system of judicial torture never existed and its use was limited to political cases. Torture was in theory not permitted under English law, but in [[Tudors|Tudor]] and early [[Stuarts|Stuart]] times, under certain conditions, torture was used in England. For example, the confession of [[Marc Smeaton]] at the trial of [[Anne Boleyn]] was presented in written form only, either to hide from the court that Smeaton had been tortured on [[Rack (torture)|the rack]] for four hours, or because [[Thomas Cromwell]] was worried that he would recant his confession if cross-examined. When [[Guy Fawkes]] was arrested for his role in the [[Gunpowder Plot]] of 1605 he was tortured until he revealed all he knew about the plot. This was not so much to extract a confession, which was not needed to prove his guilt, but to extract from him the names of his fellow conspirators. By this time torture was not routine in England and a special warrant from King [[James I of England|James I]] was needed before he could be tortured. The wording of the warrant shows some concerns for humanitarian considerations, specifying that the severity of the methods of interrogation were to be increased only gradually until the interrogators were sure that Fawkes had told all he knew. In the end this did not help Fawkes much as he was broken on the only rack in England, which was in the [[Tower of London]].

The [[privy council]] attempted to have [[John Felton (assassin)|John Felton]] who stabbed [[George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham]] to death in 1628 questioned under torture on the rack, but the judges resisted, unanimously declaring its use to be contrary to the [[English law|laws of England]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jardine|first=David|authorlink=David Jardine (barrister)|title=A Reading on the Use of Torture in the Criminal Law of England|publisher=Baldwin and Cradock|location=London|year=1837|pages=10–12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Torture was abolished in England around 1640 (except ''[[peine forte et dure]]'', which was abolished in 1772).

In [[Colonial America]], women were sentenced to the [[stocks]] with wooden clips on their tongues or subjected to the "[[dunking stool]]" for the gender-specific crime of talking too much.&lt;ref&gt;Brizendine, Louann ''The Female Brain'' Broadway Books.

In the 17th century the number of incidents of judicial torture decreased in many European regions. [[Johann Graefe]] in 1624 published ''Tribunal Reformation'', a case against torture. [[Cesare Beccaria]], an Italian lawyer, published in 1764 "An Essay on Crimes and Punishments", in which he argued that torture unjustly punished the innocent and should be unnecessary in proving guilt. [[Voltaire]] (1694–1778) also fiercely condemned torture in some of his essays.

While in Egypt in 1798, [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] wrote to Major-General Berthier regarding the validity of torture as an interrogation tool:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The barbarous custom of whipping men suspected of having important secrets to reveal must be abolished. It has always been recognized that this method of interrogation, by putting men to the torture, is useless. The wretches say whatever comes into their heads and whatever they think one wants to believe. Consequently, the Commander-in-Chief forbids the use of a method which is contrary to reason and humanity.&lt;ref&gt;Napoleon Bonaparte, ''Letters and Documents of Napoleon, Volume I: The Rise to Power'', selected and translated by John Eldred Howard (London: The Cresset Press, 1961), 274.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

European states abolished torture from their statutory law in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. England abolished torture in about 1640 (except [[peine forte et dure]], which England only abolished in 1772), Scotland in 1708, [[Prussia]] in 1740, Denmark around 1770, Russia in 1774, [[Habsburg Monarchy|Austria]] and [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth|Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]] in 1776, Italy &lt;!--anachronism; Italy, as a unified state, didn't exist until 1861--&gt; in 1786, France in 1789, and [[Baden]] in 1831.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ccel.org/s/schaff/hcc4/htm/i.vi.viii.htm History of the Christian Church, Volume IV: Mediaeval Christianity.

===Methods of torture===
[[File:Modocs Scalping and Torturing Prisoners.jpg|thumb|[[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] [[scalping]] and torturing prisoners, published in May 1873]]
Tortures included the chevalet, in which an accused witch sat on a pointed metal horse with weights strung from her feet.&lt;ref name="Naish p27"&gt;Camille Naish, ''Death Comes To The Maiden: Sex and Execution 1431-1933'' (London: Routledge, 1991), 27.&lt;/ref&gt; Sexual humiliation torture included forced sitting on red-hot stools.&lt;ref&gt;Henry Charles Lea, ''Witchcraft'', pg 236 as quoted in Camille Naish, ''Death Comes To The Maiden: Sex and Execution 1431-1933'' (London: Routledge, 1991), 28.&lt;/ref&gt; Gresillons, also called pennywinkis in Scotland, or pilliwinks, crushed the tips of fingers and toes in a vise-like device.&lt;ref name="HRTR p120"&gt;H.R. Trevor-Roper, ''The European Witch-Craze of The Sixteenth and Seventeenth Centuries and Other Essays,'' (New York: Harper and Row, 1969), 120.&lt;/ref&gt; The Spanish Boot, or "leg-screw", used mostly in Germany and Scotland, was a steel boot that was placed over the leg of the accused and was tightened. The pressure from the squeezing of the boot would break the shin bone in pieces. An anonymous Scotsman called it "The most severe and cruel pain in the world".&lt;ref name="HRTR p121"&gt;H.R. Trevor-Roper, ''The European Witch-Craze of The Sixteenth and Seventeenth Centuries and Other Essays,'' (New York: Harper and Row, 1969), 121.&lt;/ref&gt; Ingenious variants of the Spanish boot were also designed to slowly crush feet between iron plates armed with terrifying spikes. The echelle more commonly known as the "ladder" or "rack" was a long table that the accused would lie upon and be stretched violently. The torture was used so intensely that on many occasions the victim's limbs would be pulled out of the socket and, at times, the limbs would even be torn from the body entirely. On some special occasions a tortillon was used in conjunction with the ladder which would severely squeeze and mutilate the genitals at the same time as the stretching was occurring.&lt;ref name="HRTR p120"/&gt; Similar to the ladder was the "lift". It too stretched the limbs of the accused; in this instance however the victim's feet were strapped to the ground and their arms were tied behind their back before a rope was tied to their hands and lifted upwards. This caused the arms to break before the portion of the stretching began.&lt;ref name="HRTR p121"/&gt; Finally, the judicial system of King James favored the use of the turkas, an ingenious and savage iron instrument for destroying the nails of the fingers and toes. The sharp point of the instrument was first pushed under the nail to the root, splitting the nail down the centerline. Pincers then grabbed either edge of the destroyed nail and slowly tore it away from the nail bed.  Other common tortures included the strappado, a system of weights and pulleys with which the prisoner was trussed up and jerked in order to dislocate his limbs; the water torture, by which he was maintained at the very edge of drowning; and the so-called torture by fire, in which the bare feet, immobilized in an iron stocks and smeared with lard, were slowly barbecued over red-hot coals.

===Since 1948===

{{Main article|Use of torture since 1948}}

Modern sensibilities have been shaped by a profound reaction to the [[war crimes]] and [[crimes against humanity]] committed by the [[Axis Powers]] and [[Allies of World War II|Allied Powers]] in the [[Second World War]], which have led to a sweeping international rejection of most if not all aspects of the practice.&lt;ref&gt;Elihu Lauterpacht, C. J. Greenwood ''International Law Reports'', Cambridge University Press, 2002 {{ISBN|0-521-66122-6}}, {{ISBN|978-0-521-66122-5}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=_mutsUVLw7gC&amp;pg=PA139&amp;lpg=PA139 p. 139 section 189]&lt;/ref&gt; Even as many states engage in torture, few wish to be described as doing so, either to their own citizens or to the international community. A variety of devices bridge this gap, including state [[plausible deniability|denial]], "[[secret police]]", "[[need to know]]", a denial that given treatments are torturous in nature, appeal to various laws (national or international), the use of [[judicial jurisdiction|jurisdictional argument]] and the claim of "overriding need". Throughout history and today, many states have engaged in torture, albeit unofficially. Torture ranges from physical, psychological, political, interrogations techniques, and also includes rape of anyone outside of law enforcement.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Broken Spirits: The Treatment of Traumatized Asylum Seekers, Refugees, War ...

According to scholar [[Ervand Abrahamian]], although there were several decades of prohibition of torture that spread from Europe to most parts of the world, by the 1980s, the taboo against torture was broken and torture "returned with a vengeance," propelled in part by television and an opportunity to break political prisoners and broadcast the resulting public recantations of their political beliefs for "ideological warfare, political mobilization, and the need to win 'hearts and minds.'"&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.google.com/search?tbm=bks&amp;tbo=1&amp;q=Tortured+confessions+%22hearts+and+minds%22&amp;safe=active#sclient=psy&amp;hl=en&amp;safe=active&amp;tbo=1&amp;tbm=bks&amp;source=hp&amp;q=Tortured+confessions+abrahamian+%22hearts+and+minds%22&amp;aq=f&amp;aqi=&amp;aql=&amp;oq=&amp;pbx=1&amp;fp=e169c8353451e3d9 Tortured confessions: prisons and public recantations in modern Iran] - Page 3
&lt;/ref&gt;
In the years 2004 and 2005, over 16 countries were documented using torture.&lt;ref name="hrw.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/|title=Human Rights Watch - Defending Human Rights Worldwide|website=hrw.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an attempt to bring global awareness, Human Rights Watch, has created an internet site to alert people to news and multimedia publications about torture occurring worldwide.&lt;ref name="hrw.org"/&gt; The International Rehabilitation Council for Torture Victims [IRCT] made a global analysis of torture based on [Amnesty International, 2001], [Human Rights Watch, 2003], [United Nations, 2002], [U.S. Department of State, 2002] yearly human rights reports. These reports showed that torture and ill treatment are consistently report based on all four sources in 32 countries. At least two reports the use of torture and ill treatment in at least 80 countries. These reports confirm the assumption that torture occurs in a quarter of the world's countries on a regular basis. This global prevalence of torture is estimated on the magnitude of particular high-risk groups and the amount of torture used by these groups. "Such groups comprise refugees and persons who are or have been under torture." &lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;
According to professor Darius Rejali, although dictatorships may have used tortured "more, and more indiscriminately", it was modern democracies, "the United States, Britain, and France" who "pioneered and exported techniques that have become the lingua franca of modern torture: methods that leave no marks."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boston.com/bostonglobe/ideas/articles/2007/12/16/torture_american_style/?page=1|title=Torture, American style|website=Boston.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The practice of torture used as the oppression against political opponents or could be a part of criminal investigation or interrogation techniques in order to obtain the desired information and keep law enforcement empowered over everyday citizens.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

The modern concept of torture methods that leave no physical evidence is noted in 1995 by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders [[DSM-IV]] within the changing definition of Post-traumatic Stress Disorder [[PTSD]]. This revised definition included psychological torture stating: "Expresses concern that the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders definition of posttraumatic stress disorder does not include those forms of psychological torture in which the physical integrity of a person is not threatened. It is suggested that any diagnostic criterion that characterizes the traumatic stressors leading to PTSD should be expressed in such a way that psychological forms of torture are included."&lt;ref&gt;[Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders: DSM-IV-TR.. 4th ed. Washington, DC: American Psychiatric Association, 2000.]&lt;/ref&gt;
After 1995, the sweeping definition of changes from 'any act by which severe pain or suffering, whether ''mental'' or ''physical'', is intentionally inflicted on a person' to including the terms ''psychological torture'' and including examples such as, interrogation techniques range from sleep deprivation, solitary confinement, fear and humiliation to severe sexual and cultural humiliation and use of threats and phobias to induce fear of death or injury.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Reyes|first=Hernan|title=The Worst Scars are in the Mind: Psychological Torture|journal=The International Review of the Red Cross|year=2007|volume=89|issue=867|pages=591–617|doi=10.1017/s1816383107001300}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:AbuGhraibAbuse-standing-on-box.jpg|thumb|[[Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse]].]]
Torture still occurs in a small number{{cn|date=November 2018}} of liberal democracies despite several international treaties such as the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] and the [[UN Convention Against Torture]] making torture illegal. Despite such international conventions, torture cases continue to arise such as the 2004 [[Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse]] scandal committed by personnel of the [[United States Army]]. The [[U.S. Constitution]] and [[U.S. law]] prohibits the use of torture, yet such human rights violations occurred during the [[War on Terror]] under the euphemism [[Enhanced interrogation techniques|Enhanced interrogation]]. The United States revised the previous torture policy in 2009 under the Obama Administration. This revision revokes the Executive Order 13440 of 20 July 2007, under which the incident at Abu Ghraib and prisoner abuse occurred. Executive Order 13491 of 22 January 2009 further defines United States policy on torture and interrogation techniques in an attempt to further prevent another torture incident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/the_press_office/EnsuringLawfulInterrogations|title=Executive Order 13491 -- Ensuring Lawful Interrogations|website=The White House|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111218212240/http://www.whitehouse.gov/the_press_office/EnsuringLawfulInterrogations|archivedate=18 December 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yet apparently the practice continues, albeit outsourced.&lt;ref&gt;[https://apnews.com/4925f7f0fa654853bd6f2f57174179fe In Yemen's secret prisons, UAE tortures and US interrogates] Associated Press, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the findings of Dr. Christian Davenport of the [[University of Notre Dame]], Professor William Moore of [[Florida State University]], and David Armstrong of [[Oxford University]] during their torture research, evidence suggests that non-governmental organizations have played the most determinant factor for stopping torture once it gets started.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Davenport|first=Christian|title=Helsinki Commission Hearing|url=http://www.csce.gov/index.cfm?Fuseaction=ContentRecords.ViewWitness&amp;ContentRecord_id=907&amp;ContentType=D&amp;ContentRecordType=D&amp;ParentType=H&amp;CFID=5892559&amp;CFTOKEN=28254175|website=Hearing: "Is It Torture Yet?"|publisher=US Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe|accessdate=21 November 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120118231903/http://www.csce.gov/index.cfm?Fuseaction=ContentRecords.ViewWitness&amp;ContentRecord_id=907&amp;ContentType=D&amp;ContentRecordType=D&amp;ParentType=H&amp;CFID=5892559&amp;CFTOKEN=28254175|archivedate=18 January 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Preliminary research suggests that it is civil society, not government institutions, that can stop torture once it has begun. This inability to control abuse and torture in society creates an imperfect Democracy non-compliant with internationally agreed upon standards for civil and political rights.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Many organizations serve to expose widespread human rights violations and hold individuals accountable to the [[international community]].

===Historical methods of execution and capital punishment===
{{Main article|List of methods of capital punishment}}
{{See also|Execution}}

For most of recorded history, capital punishments were often cruel and inhumane. Severe historical penalties include [[breaking wheel]], [[boiling to death]], [[flaying]], [[slow slicing]], [[disembowelment]], [[crucifixion]], [[impalement]], [[Crushing (execution)|crushing]], [[stoning]], [[execution by burning]], [[dismemberment]], [[sawing (torture)|sawing]], [[decapitation]], [[scaphism]], or [[necklacing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,950826,00.html|title=The Death Penalty :Revenge Is the Mother of Invention|date=24 January 1983|website=TIME.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Slow slicing'', or ''death by/of a thousand cuts'', was a form of [[execution]] used in China from roughly 900 AD to its abolition in 1905. According to apocryphal lore, ''líng che'' began when the torturer, wielding an extremely sharp knife, began by putting out the eyes, rendering the condemned incapable of seeing the remainder of the torture and, presumably, adding considerably to the psychological terror of the procedure. Successive rather minor cuts chopped off ears, nose, tongue, fingers, toes, and such before proceeding to grosser cuts that removed large collops of flesh from more sizable parts, e.g., thighs and shoulders. The entire process was said to last three days, and to total 3,600 cuts. The heavily carved bodies of the deceased were then put on a parade for a show in the public. More typical was to bribe the executioner to administer hasty death to the victim after a small number of dramatic slices inflicted for showmanship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.manchestereventsguide.co.uk/feature/Death_by_a_Thousand_Cuts_at_Chinese_Arts_Centre_18th_January_to_23rd_March/114.html|title=Death by a Thousand Cuts at Chinese Arts Centre until 23rd March|website=manchestereventsguide.co.uk|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090418031632/http://www.manchestereventsguide.co.uk/feature/Death_by_a_Thousand_Cuts_at_Chinese_Arts_Centre_18th_January_to_23rd_March/114.html|archivedate=18 April 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lamb, H. (1927). ''Genghis Khan: Emperor of all men''. (New York: American Reprint Co.)&lt;/ref&gt;

''Impalement'' was a method of torture and [[execution (legal)|execution]] whereby a person is pierced with a long stake. The penetration can be through the sides, from the [[rectum]], or through the [[Human mouth|mouth]] or [[vagina]]. This method would lead to slow, painful, death. Often, the victim was hoisted into the air after partial impalement. Gravity and the victim's own struggles would cause him to slide down the pole. Death could take many days. Impalement was frequently practiced in Asia and Europe throughout the [[Middle Ages]]. [[Vlad III Dracula]] and [[Ivan the Terrible]] have passed into legend as major users of the method.&lt;ref&gt;[http://concise.britannica.com/ebc/article-9382120/Dracula Dracula - Britannica Concise] {{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''breaking wheel'' was a torturous [[capital punishment]] device used in the [[Middle Ages]] and early modern times for public execution by [[Club (weapon)|cudgeling]] to death, especially in France and Germany. In France the condemned were placed on a cart-wheel with their limbs stretched out along the spokes over two sturdy wooden beams. The wheel was made to slowly revolve. Through the openings between the spokes, the executioner hit the victim with an iron hammer that could easily break the victim's bones. This process was repeated several times per limb. Once his bones were broken, he was left on the wheel to die. It could take hours, even days, before shock and dehydration caused death. The punishment was abolished in Germany as late as 1827.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Wheel, Breaking on the |volume=28 |page=586}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Etymology===
The word 'torture' comes from the French ''torture'', originating in the [[Late Latin]] ''tortura'' and ultimately deriving the [[past participle]] of ''torquere'' meaning 'to twist'.&lt;ref name="isbn0877797137 "&gt;{{Cite book|title=Merriam-Webster's collegiate dictionary, 10th Edition |publisher=Merriam-Webster |location=Springfield, Mass |year=1999 |page= 1246|isbn=978-0-87779-713-5 |oclc= |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; The word is also used loosely to describe more ordinary discomforts that would be accurately described as tedious rather than painful; for example, "making this spreadsheet was torture!"

According to Diderot's ''[[Encyclopédie]]'', torture was also referred to as "the question" in seventeenth century France. This term is derived from torture's use in criminal cases: as the accused is tortured, the torturers would typically ask questions to the accused in an effort to learn more about the crime.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://quod.lib.umich.edu/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=did;cc=did;rgn=main;view=text;idno=did2222.0000.891 | title = Question or Torture | accessdate = 1 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{anchor|Religious perspectives}}

==Religious perspectives==

===Roman Catholic Church===
{{main article|Inquisition|Spanish Inquisition|Medieval Inquisition}}
{{see also|Christian views on Hell#Roman Catholicism}}

Throughout the [[Early Middle Ages]], the [[Catholic Church]] generally opposed the use of torture during criminal proceedings. This is evident from a letter sent by Pope [[Pope Nicholas I|Saint Nicholas]] the Great to [[Boris I of Bulgaria|Khan Boris]] of the Bulgars in AD 866, delivered in response to a series of questions from the former and concerned with the ongoing [[Christianization of Bulgaria|Christianisation of Bulgaria]]. ''Ad Consulta Vestra'' (as entitled in Latin) declared judicial torture to be a practice that was fundamentally contrary to [[divine law]].&lt;ref name="legacy.fordham.edu"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Responses of Pope Nicholas I to the Questions of the Bulgars, 866|url=http://legacy.fordham.edu/halsall/basis/866nicholas-bulgar.asp=27}}{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Pontiff made it a point of incontrovertible truth that, in his own words: "confession [to a crime] should be spontaneous, not compelled, and should not be elicited with violence but rather proferred voluntarily". He argued for an alternative and more humane procedure, in which the accused person would be required to swear an oath of innocence upon the "holy Gospel that he did not commit [the crime] which is laid against him and from that moment on the matter is [to be put] at an end".&lt;ref name="legacy.fordham.edu"/&gt; Nicholas likewise stressed in the same letter that "those who refuse to receive the good of Christianity and sacrifice and bend their knees to idols" were to be moved towards accepting the true faith "by warnings, exhortations, and reason rather than by force," emphasising to this end that "violence should by no means be inflicted upon them to make them believe. For everything which is not voluntary, cannot be good".&lt;ref name="legacy.fordham.edu"/&gt;

In the High Middle Ages the Church became increasingly concerned with the perceived threat posed to its existence by resurgent heresy, in particular that attributed to a purported sect known as the [[Cathars]]. Catharism had its roots in the Paulician movement in Armenia and eastern Byzantine Anatolia and the [[Bogomils]] of the [[First Bulgarian Empire]]. Consequently, the Church began to enjoin secular rulers to extirpate heresy (lest the ruler’s Catholic subjects be absolved from their allegiance), and in order to coerce heretics or witnesses "into confessing their errors and accusing others," decided to sanction the use of methods of torture, already utilized by secular governments in other criminal procedures due to the [[Medieval Roman law|recovery of Roman Law]], in the medieval inquisitions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Canons of the Fourth Lateran Council, 1215|url=http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/basis/lateran4.asp|website=canon 3|accessdate=5 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SS Innocentius IV – Bulla 'Ad_Extirpanda'|url=http://www.documentacatholicaomnia.eu/01p/1252-05-15,_SS_Innocentius_IV,_Bulla_%27Ad_Extirpanda%27,_EN.pdf|website=1252|accessdate=5 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Pope Innocent IV, in the Bull [[Ad extirpanda]] (15 May 1252), stipulated that the inquisitors were to "stop short of danger to life or limb".&lt;ref&gt;''Ad extirpanda'', quoted at [http://www.rtforum.org/lt/lt119.html ''The Roman Theological Forum'']&lt;/ref&gt;

The modern Church's views regarding torture have changed drastically, largely reverting to the earlier stance. In 1953, in an address to the 6th International Congress of Penal Law, Pope Pius XII approvingly reiterated the position of Pope Nicholas the Great over a thousand years before him, when his predecessor had unilaterally opposed the use of judicial torture, stating: {{quotation|
Preliminary juridical proceedings must exclude physical and psychological torture and the use of drugs: first of all because they violate a natural right, even if the accused is indeed guilty, and secondly because all too often they give rise to erroneous results...About eleven hundred years ago, in 866, the great Pope Nicholas I replied in the following way to a question posed by a people which had just come into contact with Christianity...Who would not wish that, during the long period of time elapsed since then, justice had never laid this rule aside! The need to recall the warning given eleven hundred years ago is a sad sign of the miscarriages of juridical practice in the twentieth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Pope Pius XII: 6th International Congress of Penal Law |url=https://books.google.com/?id=gyIgwz_lDGkC&amp;pg=PA161&amp;dq=torture+pius+xii+nicholas#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|website=1252|isbn=9789287145147|last1=Carpentier|first1=Jean|last2=Council For Cultural Co-Operation|first2=Council of Europe|date=2001-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} Thus, the ''[[Catechism of the Catholic Church]]'' (published in 1994) condemns the use of torture as a grave violation of [[Human Rights]]. In No. 2297-2298 it states:

{{quotation|
Torture, which uses physical or moral violence to extract confessions, punish the guilty, frighten opponents, or satisfy hatred is contrary to respect for the person and for human dignity... In times past, cruel practices were commonly used by legitimate governments to maintain law and order, often without protest from the Pastors of the Church, who themselves adopted in their own tribunals the prescriptions of Roman law concerning torture. Regrettable as these facts are, the Church always taught the duty of clemency and mercy. She forbade clerics to shed blood. In recent times it has become evident that these cruel practices were neither necessary for public order, nor in conformity with the legitimate rights of the human person. On the contrary, these practices led to ones even more degrading. It is necessary to work for their abolition. We must pray for the victims and their tormentors. }}

===Sharia law===
The prevalent view among jurists of [[sharia law]] is that torture is permissible only for the maintenance of law and order.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} Violations in some stricter jurisdictions include acts of public indecency or immorality, which can result in floggings. {{citation needed|date=November 2017}} Other sharia-derived punishments that might overlap with widely held notions of torture include the various forms of [[hudud]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Banchoff|first1=Thomas|title=Democracy and the New Religious Pluralism|date=2007|page=147}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In Judaism===
Torture has no presence within [[halakha]]. There did once exist a system of [[capital and corporal punishment in Judaism]], as well as a [[Flagellation#Judaism|flagellation]] statute for non-capital offences, but it was all abolished by the [[Sanhedrin]] during the [[Second Temple period]].

[[Maimonides]] issued a ruling in the case of a man who was ordered by a [[Beth Din]] to divorce his wife and refuses, that "we coerce him until he states 'I want to.'"&lt;ref&gt;Maimoides; ''[[Mishneh Torah]]'' Hilkhot Gerushin 2:20&lt;/ref&gt; This is only true in cases where specific grounds for the verdict exist.&lt;ref&gt;Malinowitz, Chaim;[http://www.jlaw.com/Articles/getart3.html "The New York State Get Bill and its Halachic Ramifications"]; ''Jewish Law Articles''&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1990s, some activist rabbis had interpreted this statement to mean that torture could be applied against husbands in troubled marriages in order to force them into granting religious divorces to their wives.&lt;ref&gt;Samaha, Albert (4 December 2013) [http://www.villagevoice.com/news/bad-rabbi-tales-of-extortion-and-torture-depict-a-divorce-brokers-brutal-grip-on-the-orthodox-community-6440276 "Bad Rabbi: Tales of Extortion and Torture Depict a Divorce Broker's Brutal Grip on the Orthodox Community"], ''Village Voice''&lt;/ref&gt; These rabbis were later implicated in the [[2013 New York divorce torture plot]].&lt;ref&gt;Blau, Reuven (22 April 2015) [http://www.nydailynews.com/news/crime/orthodox-rabbi-guilty-kidnapping-beating-jewish-husbands-article-1.2193597/ "N.J.

==Laws against torture==
On 10 December 1948, the [[United Nations General Assembly]] adopted the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] (UDHR). Article 5 states, "No one shall be subjected to torture or to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/Overview/rights.html Universal Declaration of Human Rights], United Nations, 10 December 1948&lt;/ref&gt; Since that time, a number of other international treaties have been adopted to prevent the use of torture. The most notable treaties relating to torture are the [[United Nations Convention Against Torture]] and the [[Geneva Conventions|Geneva Conventions of 1949]] and their [[Protocol I|Additional Protocols I]] and [[Protocol II|II]] of 8 June 1977.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.icrc.org/eng/resources/documents/faq/torture-law-2011-06-24.htm |title=What does the law say about torture? |publisher=[[International Committee of the Red Cross]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Nations Convention Against Torture===
The [[United Nations Convention Against Torture|United Nations Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment]] came into force in June 1987. The most relevant articles are Articles 1, 2, 3, and 16.

{{quotation|Article 1&lt;br /&gt;
1. For the purposes of this Convention, the word "torture" means any act by which severe pain or suffering, whether physical or mental, is intentionally inflicted on a person for such purposes as obtaining from him or a third person information or a confession, punishing him for an act he or a third person has committed or is suspected of having committed, or intimidating or coercing him or a third person, or for any reason based on discrimination of any kind, when such pain or suffering is inflicted by or at the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a public official or other person acting in an official capacity. It does not include pain or suffering arising only from, inherent in or incidental to lawful sanctions.&lt;br /&gt;
2. This article is without prejudice to any international instrument or national legislation which does or may contain provisions of wider application.}}

{{quotation|Article 2&lt;br /&gt;
1. Each State Party shall take effective legislative, administrative, judicial or other measures to prevent acts of torture in any territory under its jurisdiction.&lt;br /&gt;
2. No exceptional circumstances whatsoever, whether a state of [[war]] or a threat of war, internal [[Failed state|political instability]] or any other [[State of emergency|public emergency]], may be invoked as a justification of torture.&lt;br /&gt;
3. An [[Superior Orders|order from a superior officer or a public authority]] may not be invoked as a justification of torture.}}

{{quotation|Article 3&lt;br /&gt;
1. No State Party shall expel, return ("refouler") or extradite a person to another State where there are substantial grounds for believing that he would be in danger of being subjected to torture.&lt;br /&gt;
2. For the purpose of determining whether there are such grounds, the competent authorities shall take into account all relevant considerations including, where applicable, the existence in the State concerned of a consistent pattern of gross, flagrant or mass violations of human rights.}}

{{quotation|Article 16&lt;br /&gt;
1. Each State Party shall undertake to prevent in any territory under its jurisdiction other acts of cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment which do not amount to torture as defined in article I, when such acts are committed by or at the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a public official or other person acting in an official capacity. In particular, the obligations contained in articles 10, 11, 12 and 13 shall apply with the substitution for references to torture of references to other forms of cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.&lt;br /&gt;
2. The provisions of this Convention are without prejudice to the provisions of any other international instrument or national law which prohibits cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment or which relates to extradition or expulsion.}}

{{Main article|International Criminal Court}}

The [[Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court|Rome Statute]], which established the [[International Criminal Court]] (ICC), provides for criminal prosecution of individuals responsible for [[genocide]], [[war crime]]s, and [[crimes against humanity]]. The statute defines torture as "intentional infliction of severe pain or suffering, whether physical or mental, upon a person in the custody or under the control of the accused; except that torture shall not include pain or suffering arising only from, inherent in or incidental to, lawful sanctions". Under Article 7 of the statute, torture may be considered a crime against humanity "when committed as part of a widespread or systematic attack directed against any civilian population, with knowledge of the attack".&lt;ref&gt;Article 7 of the [http://legal.un.org/icc/statute/99_corr/cstatute.htm Rome Statute].

===Geneva Conventions===
The four [[Geneva Conventions]] provide protection for people who fall into enemy hands.
The conventions do not clearly divide people into [[combatant]] and [[non-combatant]] roles. The conventions refer to:
* "wounded and sick combatants or non-combatants"
* "civilian persons who take no part in hostilities, and who, while they reside in the zones, perform no work of a military character"&lt;ref&gt;[[s:Fourth Geneva Convention|Fourth Geneva Convention]], Article 15.&lt;/ref&gt;
* "Members of the [[armed forces]] of a Party to the conflict as well as members of [[militias]] or [[Military volunteer|volunteer corps]] forming part of such armed forces"
* "Members of other militias and members of other volunteer corps, including those of organized [[resistance movements]] belonging to a Party to the conflict and operating in or outside their own territory, even if this [[Military occupation|territory is occupied]]"
* "Members of regular armed forces who profess allegiance to a government or an authority not recognized by the Detaining Power"
* "Persons who accompany the armed forces without actually being members thereof, such as civilian members of [[military aircraft]] crews, [[war correspondent]]s, supply contractors, members of labour units or of services responsible for the welfare of the armed forces"
* "Members of crews, including masters, pilots and apprentices, of the [[merchant marine]] and the crews of [[civil aircraft]] of the Parties to the conflict"
* "Inhabitants of a non-occupied territory, who on the approach of the enemy spontaneously take up arms to resist the invading forces, without having had time to form themselves into regular armed units".&lt;ref&gt;[[s:Third Geneva Convention|Third Geneva Convention]], Article 4&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[first Geneva Convention|first]] (GCI), [[second Geneva Convention|second]] (GCII), [[third Geneva Convention|third]] (GCIII), and [[fourth Geneva Convention|fourth]] (GCIV) Geneva Conventions are the four most relevant for the treatment of the victims of conflicts. All treaties states in Article 3, in similar wording, that in a non-international armed conflict, "Persons taking no active part in the hostilities, including members of armed forces who have laid down their arms... shall in all circumstances be treated humanely." The treaty also states that there must not be any "violence to life and person, in particular murder of all kinds, [[mutilation]], cruel treatment and torture" or "outrages upon personal dignity, in particular humiliating and degrading treatment".&lt;ref&gt;[[s:First Geneva Convention|First Geneva Convention]], 12 August 1949.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[s:Second Geneva Convention|Second Geneva Convention]], 12 August 1949.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[s:Third Geneva Convention|Third Geneva Convention]], 12 August 1949.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[s:Fourth Geneva Convention|Fourth Geneva Convention]], 12 August 1949.&lt;/ref&gt;

GCI covers wounded combatants in an international armed conflict. Under Article 12, members of the armed forces who are sick or wounded "shall be respected and protected in all circumstances. They shall be treated humanely and cared for by the Party to the conflict in whose power they may be, without any adverse distinction founded on sex, race, nationality, religion, political opinions, or any other similar criteria. Any attempts upon their lives, or violence to their persons, shall be strictly prohibited; in particular, they shall not be murdered or exterminated, subjected to torture or to biological experiments".

GCII covers shipwreck survivors at sea in an international armed conflict. Under Article 12, persons "who are at sea and who are wounded, sick or shipwrecked, shall be respected and protected in all circumstances, it being understood that the term "shipwreck" means shipwreck from any cause and includes forced landings at sea by or from aircraft. Such persons shall be treated humanely and cared for by the Parties to the conflict in whose power they may be, without any adverse distinction founded on sex, race, nationality, religion, political opinions, or any other similar criteria. Any attempts upon their lives, or violence to their persons, shall be strictly prohibited; in particular, they shall not be murdered or exterminated, subjected to torture or to biological experiments".

GCIII covers the treatment of [[prisoners of war]] (POWs) in an international armed conflict. In particular, Article 17 says that "No physical or mental torture, nor any other form of coercion, may be inflicted on prisoners of war to secure from them information of any kind whatever. Prisoners of war who refuse to answer may not be threatened, insulted or exposed to unpleasant or disadvantageous treatment of any kind." POW status under GCIII has far fewer exemptions than "Protected Person" status under GCIV. Captured combatants in an international armed conflict automatically have the protection of GCIII and are POWs under GCIII unless they are determined by a competent tribunal to not be a POW (GCIII Article 5).

GCIV covers most [[civilian]]s in an international armed conflict, and says they are usually "Protected Persons" (see exemptions section immediately after this for those who are not). Under Article 32, civilians have the right to protection from "murder, torture, corporal punishments, mutilation and medical or scientific experiments...but also to any other measures of brutality whether applied by civilian or military agents."

====Geneva Convention IV exemptions====
GCIV provides an important exemption:
{{quotation|Where in the territory of a Party to the conflict, the latter is satisfied that an individual protected person is definitely suspected of or engaged in activities hostile to the security of the State, such individual person shall not be entitled to claim such rights and privileges under the present Convention [ie GCIV] as would ... be prejudicial to the security of such State ... In each case, such persons shall nevertheless be treated with humanity (GCIV Article 5)}}

Also, nationals of a State not bound by the Convention are not protected by it, and nationals of a neutral State in the territory of a combatant State, and nationals of a co-belligerent State, cannot claim the protection of GCIV if their home state has normal diplomatic representation in the State that holds them (Article 4), as their diplomatic representatives can take steps to protect them. The requirement to treat persons with "humanity" implies that it is still prohibited to torture individuals not protected by the Convention.

The [[George W. Bush administration]] afforded fewer protections, under GCIII, to detainees in the "[[War on Terror]]" by codifying the legal status of an "[[unlawful combatant]]". If there is a question of whether a person is a lawful combatant, he (or she) must be treated as a POW "until their status has been determined by a competent tribunal" (GCIII Article 5). If the tribunal decides that he is an unlawful combatant, he is not considered a protected person under GCIII. However, if he is a protected person under GCIV he still has some protection under GCIV, and must be "treated with humanity and, in case of trial, shall not be deprived of the rights of fair and regular trial prescribed by the present Convention" (GCIV Article 5).&lt;ref group=nb&gt;
"Every person in enemy hands must have some status under international law: he is either a prisoner of war and, as such, covered by the Third Convention, a civilian covered by the Fourth Convention, or again, a member of the medical personnel of the armed forces who is covered by the First Convention. ''There is no'' intermediate status; nobody in enemy hands can be outside the law. We feel that this is a satisfactory solution – not only satisfying to the mind, but also, and above all, satisfactory from the humanitarian point of view.", because in the opinion of the ICRC "If civilians directly engage in hostilities, they are considered 'unlawful' or 'unprivileged' combatants or belligerents (the treaties of humanitarian law do not expressly contain these terms). They may be prosecuted under the domestic law of the detaining state for such action" ([[Jean Pictet]] (ed.) – [http://www.icrc.org/ihl.nsf/COM/380-600007?OpenDocument Commentary: IV Geneva Convention Relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War (1958)] – 1994 reprint edition). [http://www.icrc.org/ihl.nsf/7c4d08d9b287a42141256739003e636b/f6c8b9fee14a77fdc125641e0052b079 Geneva Conventions Protocol I] Article 51.3 also covers this interpretation "Civilians shall enjoy the protection afforded by this section, unless and for such time as they take a direct part in hostilities".&lt;/ref&gt;

====Additional Protocols to the Geneva Conventions====
There are two additional protocols to the Geneva Convention: [[Protocol I]] (1977), relating to the protection of victims of international armed conflicts and [[Protocol II]] (1977), relating to the protection of victims of non-international armed conflicts. These clarify and extend the definitions in some areas, but to date many countries, including the United States, have either not signed them or have not ratified them.

[[Protocol I]] does not mention torture but it does affect the treatment of POWs and Protected Persons. In Article 5, the protocol explicitly involves "the appointment of Protecting Powers and of their substitute" to monitor that the Parties to the conflict are enforcing the Conventions.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080410223403/http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/protocol1.htm Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, and relating to the Protection of Victims of International Armed Conflicts (Protocol 1)], Diplomatic Conference on the Reaffirmation and Development of International Humanitarian Law applicable in Armed Conflicts, 8 June 1977.&lt;/ref&gt; The protocol also broadens the definition of a lawful combatant in wars against "alien occupation, colonial domination and racist regimes" to include those who carry arms openly but are not wearing uniforms, so that they are now [[lawful combatant]]s and protected by the Geneva Conventions—although only if the Occupying Power has ratified Protocol I. Under the original conventions, combatants without a recognizable insignia could be treated as war criminals, and potentially be executed. It also mentions spies, and defines who is a mercenary. Mercenaries and spies are considered an unlawful combatant, and not protected by the same conventions.

[[Protocol II]] "develops and supplements Article 3 [relating to the protection of victims of non-international armed conflicts] common to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949 without modifying its existing conditions of application" (Article 1). Any person who does not take part in or ceased to take part in hostilities is entitled to humane treatment. Among the acts prohibited against these persons are, "Violence to the life, health and physical or mental well-being of persons, in particular murder as well as cruel treatment such as torture, mutilation or any form of corporal punishment" (Article 4.a), "Outrages upon personal dignity, in particular humiliating and degrading treatment, rape, enforced prostitution and any form of indecent assault" (Article 4.e), and "Threats to commit any of the foregoing acts" (Article 4.h).&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080612085204/http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/protocol2.htm Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, and Relating to the Protection of Victims of Non-International Armed Conflicts (Protocol II)], Diplomatic Conference on the Reaffirmation and Development of International Humanitarian Law applicable in Armed Conflicts, 8 June 1977.&lt;/ref&gt; Clauses in other articles implore humane treatment of enemy personnel in an internal conflict. These have a bearing on torture, but no other clauses explicitly mention torture.

===Other conventions===
In accordance with the optional [[UN Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners]] (1955), ''"[[corporal punishment]], punishment by placing in a dark cell, and all cruel, inhuman or degrading punishments shall be completely prohibited as punishments for disciplinary offences."''&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080718003225/http://www.unhchr.ch/html/menu3/b/h_comp34.htm Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners], United Nations, Geneva, 1955.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]], (16 December 1966), explicitly prohibits torture and ''"cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment"'' by signatories.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080705115024/http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/ccpr.htm International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights] United Nations, 16 December 1966.&lt;/ref&gt;

;European agreements
[[File:10CFREU-Article4.jpg|right|thumb|Article 4 of the [[Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union]] prohibits torture.]]

In 1950 during the [[Cold War]], the participating member states of the [[Council of Europe]] signed the [[European Convention on Human Rights]]. The treaty was based on the [[UDHR]]. It included the provision for a court to interpret the treaty, and Article 3 '''"Prohibition of torture"''' stated; ''"No one shall be subjected to torture or to inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment."''&lt;ref&gt;[http://conventions.coe.int/treaty/en/Treaties/Html/005.htm European Convention on Human Rights], 4 November 1950(with later protocols).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1978, the [[European Court of Human Rights]] ruled that the [[five techniques]] of "[[sensory deprivation]]" were not torture as laid out in Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights, but were "''inhuman or degrading treatment''"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldlii.org/eu/cases/ECHR/1978/1.html Ireland v. United Kingdom, 1977]. (Case No. 5310/71)&lt;/ref&gt; (see [[Uses of torture in recent times#United Kingdom|Accusations of use of torture by United Kingdom]] for details). This case occurred nine years before the United Nations Convention Against Torture came into force and had an influence on thinking about what constitutes torture ever since.&lt;ref&gt;Michael John Garcia (Legislative Attorney American Law Division) [http://www.ilw.com/immigdaily/news/2005,1223-crs.pdf U.N. Convention Against Torture (CAT):Overview and Application to Interrogation Techniques] [http://www.ilw.com/ CRS Report for Congress] 7 November 2005. pp. 13-15&lt;/ref&gt;

On 26 November 1987, the member states of the [[Council of Europe]], meeting at [[Strasbourg]], adopted the [[European Convention for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment]] (ECPT). Two additional Protocols amended the Convention, which entered into force on 1 March 2002. The Convention set up the [[Committee for the Prevention of Torture]] to oversee compliance with its provisions.

;Inter-American Convention
The [[Inter-American Convention to Prevent and Punish Torture]], currently ratified by 18 nations of the [[Americas]] and in force since 28 February 1987, defines torture more expansively than the United Nations Convention Against Torture.

{{quotation|For the purposes of this Convention, torture shall be understood to be any act intentionally performed whereby physical or mental pain or suffering is inflicted on a person for purposes of criminal investigation, as a means of intimidation, as personal punishment, as a preventive measure, as a penalty, or for any other purpose. Torture shall also be understood to be the use of methods upon a person intended to obliterate the personality of the victim or to diminish his physical or mental capacities, even if they do not cause physical pain or mental anguish.

The concept of torture shall not include physical or mental pain or suffering that is inherent in or solely the consequence of lawful measures, provided that they do not include the performance of the acts or use of the methods referred to in this article.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1985"/&gt;}}

===Supervision of anti-torture treaties===
The [[Istanbul Protocol]], an official UN document, is the first set of international guidelines for documentation of torture and its consequences. It became a United Nations official document in 1999.

Under the provisions of [[OPCAT]] that entered into force on 22 June 2006 independent international and national bodies regularly visit places where people are deprived of their liberty, to prevent torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. Each state that ratified the OPCAT, according to Article 17, is responsible for creating or maintaining at least one independent national preventative mechanism for torture prevention at the domestic level.

The European Committee for the Prevention of Torture, citing Article 1 of the [[European Convention for the Prevention of Torture]], states that it will, "by means of visits, examine the treatment of persons deprived of their liberty with a view to strengthening, if necessary, the protection of such persons from torture and from inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cpt.coe.int/en/about.htm|title=About the CPT|website=coe.int}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In times of armed conflict between a signatory of the Geneva Conventions and another party, delegates of the [[International Committee of the Red Cross]] (ICRC) monitor the compliance of signatories to the Geneva Conventions, which includes monitoring the use of torture. Human rights organizations, such as [[Amnesty International]], the [[World Organization Against Torture]], and [[Association for the Prevention of Torture]] work actively to stop the use of torture throughout the world and publish reports on any activities they consider to be torture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apt.ch/|title=Association for the Prevention of Torture|website=apt.ch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Municipal law===
[[Sovereign state|States]] that ratified the [[United Nations Convention Against Torture]] have a treaty obligation to include the provisions into [[municipal law]]. The laws of many states therefore formally prohibit torture. However, such ''[[de jure]]'' legal provisions are by no means a proof that, ''[[de facto]]'', the signatory country does not use torture. To prevent torture, many legal systems have a [[right against self-incrimination]] or explicitly prohibit undue force when dealing with suspects.

The French 1789 [[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen]], of constitutional value, prohibits submitting suspects to any hardship not necessary to secure his or her person.

The [[U.S. Constitution]] and [[U.S. law]] prohibits the use of unwarranted force or coercion against any person who is subject to interrogation, detention, or arrest. The [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution]] includes protection against [[self-incrimination]], which states that "[n]o person...shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself". This serves as the basis of the [[Miranda warning]], which [[Law enforcement in the United States|U.S. law enforcement personnel]] issue to individuals upon their arrest. Additionally, the U.S. Constitution's [[Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Eighth Amendment]] forbids the use of "[[cruel and unusual punishments]]," which is widely interpreted as prohibiting torture. Finally, 18 U.S.C. § 2340&lt;ref&gt;{{USC|18|2340}} ''et seq.''.&lt;/ref&gt; ''et seq.'' define and forbid torture committed by U.S. nationals outside the United States or non-U.S. nationals who are present in the United States. As the United States recognizes [[customary international law]], or the [[law of nations]], the U.S. [[Alien Tort Claims Act]] and the [[Torture Victim Protection Act]] also provides legal remedies for victims of torture outside of the United States. Specifically, the status of torturers under the law of the United States, as determined by a famous legal decision in 1980, ''[[Filártiga v. Peña-Irala]]'', 630 [[Federal Reporter|F.2d]] 876 ([[United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit|2d Cir.]] 1980), is that, "the torturer has become, like the [[maritime piracy|pirate]] and the [[slave trade]]r before him, [[hostis humani generis]], an enemy of all mankind."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Filártiga v. Peña-Irala |vol=630 |reporter=F.2d |opinion=876 |pinpoint= |court=2d Cir. |date=1980 |url=https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/F2/630/876/238132/ |accessdate=2017-01-06 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Exclusion of evidence obtained under torture===

====International law====
Article 15 of the 1984 [[United Nations Convention Against Torture]] specify that:

{{quotation|Each State Party shall ensure that any statement which is established to have been made as a result of torture shall not be invoked as evidence in any proceedings, except against a person accused of torture as evidence that the statement was made.}}

A similar provision is also found in Article 10 of the 1985 [[Inter-American Convention to Prevent and Punish Torture]]:

{{quotation|No statement that is verified as having been obtained through torture shall be admissible as evidence in a legal proceeding, except in a legal action taken against a person or persons accused of having elicited it through acts of torture, and only as evidence that the accused obtained such statement by such means.}}

These provisions have the double dissuasive effect of nullifying any utility in using torture with the purpose of eliciting confession, as well as confirming that should a person extract statements by torture, this can be used against him or her in criminal proceedings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Human Rights in Times of Conflict and Terrorism |author=Louise Doswald-Beck |page=220 |date=21 March 2011 |publisher=Praeger; 1 edition |isbn=978-0-1995-7894-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The reason for this is because experience has shown that under torture, or even under a threat of torture, a person will say or do anything solely to avoid the pain. As a result, there is no way to know whether or not the resulting statement is actually correct. If any court relies on any evidence obtained from torture regardless of validity, it provides an incentive for state officials to force a confession, creating a marketplace for torture, both domestically and overseas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.apt.ch/en/evidence-obtained-through-torture/ |title=Exclusion of evidence obtained through torture |publisher=[[Association for the Prevention of Torture]] |accessdate=7 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Within national borders====
Most states have prohibit their legal systems from accepting evidence that is extracted by torture. The question of the use of evidence obtained under torture has arisen in connection with prosecutions during the [[War on Terror]] in the United Kingdom and the United States.

=====United Kingdom=====
In 2003, the United Kingdom's Ambassador to [[Uzbekistan]], [[Craig Murray]], suggested that it was "wrong to use information gleaned from torture".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1474852/The-envoy-silenced-after-telling-undiplomatic-truths.html|title=The envoy silenced after telling undiplomatic truths|last=Gedye|first=Robin|date=23 October 2004|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|quote=Murray fired off a memorandum to the Foreign Office last July suggesting that Britain's intelligence services were wrong to use information gleaned from torture victims|accessdate=26 August 2010|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The unanimous [[House of Lords Judicial Committee|Law Lords]] judgment on 8 December 2005 confirmed this position. They ruled that, under English law tradition, "torture and its fruits" could not be used in court.&lt;ref&gt;[http://politics.guardian.co.uk/terrorism/story/0,15935,1662107,00.html Torture evidence inadmissible in UK courts, Lords rules],''[[The Guardian]]'', 8 December 2005&lt;/ref&gt; But the information thus obtained could be used by the British police and security services as "it would be ludicrous for them to disregard information about a ticking bomb if it had been procured by torture."&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/4510866.stm Torture ruling's international impact] by Jon Silverman [[BBC]] 8 December 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

Murray's accusations did not lead to any investigation by his employer, the FCO, and he resigned after disciplinary action was taken against him in 2004. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office itself is being investigated by the [[National Audit Office (United Kingdom)|National Audit Office]] because of accusations that it has victimized, bullied and intimidated its own staff.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2087-1533100,00.html Foreign Office faces probe into 'manipulation'], Robert Winnett,''[[The Sunday Times (UK)|The Sunday Times]]'', 20 March 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

Murray later stated that he felt that he had unwittingly stumbled upon what has been called "torture by proxy".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newyorker.com/online/content/?050214on_onlineonly01 Q &amp; A: Torture by Proxy] Jane Mayer answers question asked by Amy Davidson [[The New Yorker]] on 14 February 2005 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140709140152/http://www.newyorker.com/online/content/?050214on_onlineonly01 |date=9 July 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He thought that Western countries moved people to regimes and nations where it was known that information would be extracted by torture, and made available to them.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}

Murray states that he was aware from August 2002 "that the CIA were bringing in detainees to [[Tashkent]] from [[Bagram Air Base|Bagram airport Afghanistan]], who were handed over to the [[Uzbek security services]] (SNB). I presumed at the time that these were all Uzbek nationals—that may have been a false presumption. I knew that the CIA were obtaining intelligence from their subsequent interrogation by the SNB." He goes on to say that he did not know at the time that any non-Uzbek nationals were flown to Uzbekistan and although he has studied the reports by several journalists and finds their reports credible he is not a firsthand authority on this issue.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.craigmurray.co.uk/archives/2005/07/extraordinary_r_1.html Extraordinary Rendition] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120728095612/http://www.craigmurray.co.uk/archives/2005/07/extraordinary_r_1.html |date=28 July 2012 }} on [http://www.craigmurray.co.uk/ Craig Murray's website], 11 July 2005 {{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During a [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] debate on 7 July 2009, MP [[David Davis (British politician)|David Davis]] accused the UK government of outsourcing torture, by allowing [[Rangzieb Ahmed]] to leave the country (even though they had evidence against him upon which he was later convicted for terrorism) to Pakistan, where it is said the [[Inter-Services Intelligence]] was given the go ahead by the British intelligence agencies to torture Ahmed. Davis further accused the government of trying to gag Ahmed, stopping him coming forward with his accusations, after he had been imprisoned back in the UK. He said, there was "an alleged request to drop his allegations of torture: if he did that, they could get his sentence cut and possibly give him some money. If this request to drop the torture case is true, it is frankly monstrous. It would at the very least be a criminal misuse of the powers and funds under the Government's Contest strategy, and at worst a conspiracy to pervert the course of justice."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Parliamentary Business&gt;Publications and Records &gt; Commons Publications &gt; Commons Hansard &gt; Daily Hansard -Debate|publisher=Parliament.uk|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090707/debtext/90707-0020.htm|accessdate=11 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====United States=====
In May 2008, [[Susan J. Crawford]], the [[Convening authority (court-martial)|official overseeing prosecutions]] before the [[Guantanamo military commissions]], declined to refer for trial the case of [[Mohammed al-Qahtani]] because she said, "we tortured [him]."&lt;ref name = "Qahtani Tortured"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/5134328.stm Q&amp;A: Guantanamo detentions] BBC News, 22 January 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Qhatani remains imprisoned at Guantanamo. Woodward, Bob [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/01/13/AR2009011303372.html Detainee Tortured, Says U.S. Official] Washington Post, 14 January 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Crawford said that a combination of techniques with clear medical consequences amounted to the legal definition of torture, and that torture "tainted everything going forward."&lt;ref name = "Qahtani Tortured"/&gt;

On 28 October 2008, Guantanamo military judge [[Stephen R. Henley]] ruled that the government cannot use statements made as a result of torture in the military commission case against Afghan national [[Mohammed Jawad]]. The judge held that Jawad's alleged confession to throwing a grenade at two U.S. service members and an Afghan interpreter was obtained after armed Afghan officials on 17 December 2002,&lt;ref name=usatoday13Jan2009&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/2009-01-13-torture-hearings_N.htm| title=Court hears arguments over detainee's confession| newspaper=USA Today | agency=Associated Press| date=13 January 2009 | accessdate=16 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; threatened to kill Jawad and his family. The government had previously told the judge that Jawad's alleged confession while in Afghan custody was central to the case against him. Hina Shamsi, staff attorney with the [[American Civil Liberties Union]] National Security Project stated: "We welcome the judge's decision that death threats constitute torture and that evidence obtained as a result must be excluded from trial. Unfortunately, evidence obtained through torture and coercion is pervasive in military commission cases that, by design, disregard the most fundamental due process rights, and no single decision can cure that."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://yubanet.com/usa/Guantanamo-Judge-Rejects-Evidence-Obtained-Through-Torture-In-Jawad-Case.php#.VRJHGI56LLs|title=Guantanamo Judge Rejects Evidence Obtained Through Torture In Jawad Case|website=yubanet.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402160011/http://yubanet.com/usa/Guantanamo-Judge-Rejects-Evidence-Obtained-Through-Torture-In-Jawad-Case.php#.VRJHGI56LLs|archivedate=2 April 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; A month later, on 19 November, the judge again rejected evidence gathered through coercive interrogations in the military commission case against Afghan national Mohammed Jawad, holding that the evidence collected while Jawad was in U.S. custody on 17–18 December 2002, cannot be admitted in his trial,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.aclu.org/national-security/guantanamo-judge-throws-out-more-evidence-obtained-through-torture-jawad-case|title=Guantánamo Judge Throws Out More Evidence Obtained Through Torture In Jawad Case|website=American Civil Liberties Union}}&lt;/ref&gt; mainly because the U.S. interrogator had blindfolded and hooded Jawad in order to frighten him.&lt;ref&gt;usatoday13Jan2009&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2010 New York trial of [[Ahmed Khalfan Ghailani]] who was accused of complicity in the [[1998 United States embassy bombings|1998 bombings of U.S. embassies in Tanzania and Kenya]], Judge [[Lewis A.

Torture has been criticized on humanitarian and moral grounds, on the grounds that evidence extracted by torture is unreliable, and because torture corrupts institutions that tolerate it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/ethics/torture/ethics/wrong_2.shtml|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071213004811/http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/ethics/torture/ethics/wrong_2.shtml|archivedate=13 December 2007|title=Consequentialist reasons why torture is wrong|publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt; Besides degrading the victim, torture debases the torturer: American advisors alarmed at torture by their South Vietnamese allies early in the [[Vietnam War]] concluded that "if a commander allowed his officers and men to fall in to these vices [they] would pursue them for their own sake, for the perverse pleasure they drew from them."&lt;ref name = "Bright Shining Lie"&gt;{{cite book| last =Sheehan| first = Neil| title =A Bright Shining Lie: John Paul Vann and America in Vietnam| publisher =Random House | edition =first| year =1988| pages= 104, 105| isbn =978-0-394-48447-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The consequent degeneracy destroyed discipline and morale: "[a] soldier had to learn that he existed to uphold law and order, not to undermine it."&lt;ref name = "Bright Shining Lie"/&gt;

The [[ticking time bomb scenario]], a [[thought experiment]], asks what to do to a captured terrorist who has placed a [[nuclear bomb]] in a populated area. If the terrorist is tortured, he may explain how to defuse the bomb. The scenario asks if it is ethical to torture the terrorist. A 2006 [[BBC]] poll held in 25 nations gauged support for each of the following positions:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/6063386.stm|title=One third support some torture|publisher=BBC News|date=19 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Terrorists pose such an extreme threat that governments should be allowed to use some degree of torture if it may gain information that saves innocent lives.
*Clear rules against torture should be maintained because any use of torture is immoral and will weaken international human rights.
An average of 59% of people worldwide rejected torture. However, there was a clear divide between those countries with strong rejection of torture (such as Italy, where only 14% supported torture) and nations where rejection was less strong. Often this lessened rejection is found in countries severely and frequently threatened by terrorist attacks. E.g., Israel, despite its Supreme Court outlawing torture in 1999, showed 43% supporting torture, but 48% opposing, India showed 37% supporting torture and only 23% opposing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/6063386.stm ''Ibid'']: "''Israel has the largest percentage of those polled endorsing the use of a degree of torture on prisoners, with 43% saying they agreed that some degree of torture should be allowed.''" On the Israeli Supreme Court decision outlawing torture, see Judgment Concerning the Legality of the General Security Service’s Interrogation Methods, Supreme Court of Israel, 38 I.L.M. 1471 (1999), and other references at [http://www.law.harvard.edu/students/orgs/hrj/iss14/nagan.shtml#Heading300 law.harvard.edu] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090430213030/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/6063386.stm |date=30 April 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within nations there is a clear divide between the positions of members of different ethnic groups, religions, and political affiliations, sometimes reflecting distinctions between groups considering themselves threatened or victimized by terror acts and those from the alleged perpetrator groups. For example, the study found that among Jews in Israel 53% favored some degree of torture and only 39% wanted strong rules against torture while Muslims in Israel were overwhelmingly against any use of torture, unlike Muslims polled elsewhere. Differences in general political views also can matter. In one 2006 survey by the Scripps Center at Ohio University, 66% of Americans who identified themselves as strongly Republican supported torture, compared to 24% of those who identified themselves as strongly Democratic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newspolls.org/articles/19606|title=New XHTML 1.0 Transitional Compliant Page|website=newspolls.org|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514083035/http://www.newspolls.org/articles/19606|archivedate=14 May 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2005 U.S. survey 72% of American Catholics supported the use of torture in some circumstances compared to 51% of American secularists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ncronline.org/NCR_Online/archives2/2006a/032406/032406h.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080612093225/http://ncronline.org/NCR_Online/archives2/2006a/032406/032406h.htm|title=Nation: Americans, especially Catholics, approve of torture|archivedate=12 June 2008|website=ncronline.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; A Pew survey in 2009 similarly found that the religiously unaffiliated are the least likely (40 percent) to support torture, and that the more a person claims to attend church, the more likely he or she is to condone torture; among racial/religious groups, white evangelical Protestants were far and away the most likely (62 percent) to support inflicting pain as a tool of interrogation.&lt;ref&gt;Pitts, Leonard (7 May 2009).

There are also different attitudes as to what constitutes torture, as revealed in an ABC News/Washington Post poll, where more than half of the Americans polled thought that techniques such as [[sleep deprivation]] were not torture.&lt;ref&gt;David Morris and Gary Langer ''[http://abcnews.go.com/US/story?id=90051 Poll: Torture Methods Opposed]'' ABCNEWS.com 27 May 2004 "Americans by nearly 2-to-1 oppose torturing terrorism suspects — but half believe the U.S. government, as a matter of policy, is doing it anyway. And even more think the government is employing physical abuse that falls short of torture in some cases."&lt;/ref&gt;

In practice, so-called "enhanced interrogation" techniques were employed by the CIA in situations that did not involve the "ticking time bomb" scenario that has been the subject of opinion polls and public debate. In April 2009 a former senior U.S. intelligence official and a former Army psychiatrist stated that the Bush administration applied pressure on interrogators to use the "enhanced interrogation" techniques on detainees to find evidence of cooperation between al Qaida and the late Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein's regime.&lt;ref&gt;Landay, Jonathan (21 April 2009).

On 14 February 2010, in an appearance on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s [[This Week (ABC TV series)|This Week]], Vice-President [[Dick Cheney]] reiterated his support of [[waterboarding]] and "[[enhanced interrogation]]" techniques for captured terrorist suspects, saying, "I was and remain a strong proponent of our enhanced interrogation program."&lt;ref name=ABCTW20100214&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

Pressed by the BBC in 2010 on his personal view of waterboarding, Presidential Advisor [[Karl Rove]] said: "I'm proud that we kept the world safer than it was, by the use of these techniques. They’re appropriate, they're in conformity with our international requirements and with US law."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.timesonline.co.uk, 13 March 2010, "Karl Rove says water torture is justified - and a source of pride" by Giles Whittell&lt;/ref&gt;

A 15-month investigation by the Guardian and BBC Arabic, published on March 2013, disclosed that "the US sent a veteran of the ''[[dirty war]]s'' in [[Central America]] to oversee Iraqi [[commando]] units involved in acts of torture during the [[History of Iraq (2003–2011)|American-led occupation]]. These American citizens could theoretically be tried by the [[International Criminal Court]] even though the US is not a signatory. But it would have to be referred by the [[UN security council]] and, given that the US has a [[veto]] on the council, this hypothesis is very improbable." [[Reprieve (organisation)|Reprieve]] Legal Director Kat Craig said: "This latest exposé of [[human rights abuses]] shows that torture is [[endemic]] to [[US foreign policy]]; these are considered and deliberate acts, not only sanctioned but developed by the highest echelons of [[United States Department of Defense|US security service]]."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/mar/07/pentagon-investigating-link-military-torture Pentagon investigating link between US military and torture centres in Iraq.

===Effectiveness===
{{main|Effectiveness of torture for interrogation}}
There is a strong [[Utilitarianism|utilitarian]] argument against torture; namely, that it is ineffective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/we-rsquo-ve-known-for-400-years-that-torture-doesn-rsquo-t-work/|title=On Witches and Terrorists|first=Michael|last=Shermer|journal=Scientific American|volume=316|issue=5|pages=77|doi=10.1038/scientificamerican0517-77|pmid=28437416|year=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Information supporting the ineffectiveness of torture goes back centuries. For example, during [[witch trial]]s torture was routinely used to try to force subjects to admit their guilt and to identify other witches. It was found that subjects would make up stories if it meant the torture would cease.

There is no scientific evidence supporting its effectiveness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/h4q565424126068h/|title=A utilitarian argument against torture interrogation of terrorists|journal=Science and Engineering Ethics |year=2004 |volume=10 |number=3 |page=543 |author=Jean Maria Arrigo |doi=10.1007/s11948-004-0011-y|citeseerx=10.1.1.470.9264}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The lack of scientific basis for the effectiveness of torture as an interrogation techniques is summarized in a 2006 Intelligence Science Board report titled "EDUCING INFORMATION, Interrogation: Science and Art, Foundations for the Future".&lt;ref name="Educing"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://fas.org/irp/dni/educing.pdf|title=Educing Information: Interrogation: Science and Art—Foundations for the Future|date=December 2006|publisher=National Defense Intelligence College|accessdate=15 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, some have pointed to some specific cases where torture has elicited true information.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.maths.unsw.edu.au/~jim/torturecardozo.pdf|title=J. Franklin, Evidence gained from torture: wishful thinking, checkability and extreme circumstances|year=2009|journal=Cardozo Journal of International and Comparative Law |volume= 17 |issue=2|accessdate=28 December 2009 |pages= 281–90}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rejection===
A famous example of rejection of the use of torture was cited by the Argentine [[National Commission on the Disappearance of Persons]] in whose report, Italian general [[Carlo Alberto Dalla Chiesa]] was reputed to have said in connection with the investigation of the disappearance of prime minister [[Aldo Moro]], "Italy can survive the loss of Aldo Moro. It would not survive the introduction of torture."&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20071012004601/http://nuncamas.org/english/library/nevagain/nevagain_002.htm Report of Conadep (National Commission on the Disappearance of Persons): Prologue] - 1984&lt;/ref&gt;

===Secrecy===
Before the emergence of modern policing, torture was an important aspect of policing and the use of it was openly sanctioned and acknowledged by the authority. The Economist magazine proposed that one of the reasons torture endures is that torture does indeed work in some instances to extract information/confession, if those who are being tortured are indeed guilty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.economist.com/world/international/displaystory.cfm?story_id=9832909 | work=The Economist | title=Is torture ever justified? | date=20 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Depending on the culture, torture has at times been carried on in silence (official silence &lt;ref&gt;Bakir, V. Torture, Intelligence and Sousveillance in the War on Terror: Agenda–Building Struggles. Farnham: Ashgate (2013). Available at: http://www.ashgate.com/isbn/9781472402554&lt;/ref&gt;), semi-silence (known but not spoken about), or openly acknowledged in public (to instill fear and obedience).

In the 21st century, even when states sanction their interrogation methods, torturers often work outside the law. For this reason, some prefer methods that, while unpleasant, leave victims alive and unmarked. A victim with no visible damage may lack credibility when telling tales of torture, whereas a person missing fingernails or eyes can easily prove claims of torture. Mental torture, however can leave scars just as deep and long-lasting as physical torture.&lt;ref&gt;[http://aliran.com/oldsite/monthly/2004a/5e.html Abu Ghraib and the ISA: What's the difference?] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120520150425/http://aliran.com/oldsite/monthly/2004a/5e.html |date=20 May 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Professional torturers in some countries have used techniques such as electrical shock, asphyxiation, heat, cold, noise, and sleep deprivation, which leave little evidence, although in other contexts torture frequently results in horrific mutilation or death. However the most common and prevalent form of torture worldwide in both developed and under-developed countries is beating.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/act40/016/2000/en/ Amnesty.org] &lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main article|List of methods of torture}}

[[List of torture methods and devices#Psychological torture methods|Psychological torture]] uses non-physical methods that cause psychological [[suffering]]. Its effects are not immediately apparent unless they alter the [[behavior]] of the tortured person. Since there is no international political consensus on what constitutes psychological torture, it is often overlooked, denied, and referred to by different names.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}

Psychological torture is less well known than physical torture and tends to be subtle and much easier to conceal. In practice the distinctions between physical and psychological torture are often blurred.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}} Physical torture is the inflicting of severe pain or suffering on a person. In contrast, psychological torture is directed at the psyche with calculated violations of psychological needs, along with deep damage to psychological structures and the breakage of beliefs underpinning normal [[sanity]]. Torturers often inflict both types of torture in combination to compound the associated effects.{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}}

Psychological torture also includes deliberate use of extreme [[psychological stress|stressors]] and situations such as [[mock execution]], [[shunning]], violation of deep-seated social or [[sexual norm]]s and [[taboo]]s, or extended [[solitary confinement]]. Because psychological torture needs no physical violence to be effective, it is possible to induce severe psychological pain, suffering, and [[Psychological trauma|trauma]] with no externally visible effects.{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}}

[[Rape]] and other forms of [[sexual abuse]] are often used as methods of torture for interrogative or punitive purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first=Nooria | last=Mehraby | url=http://www.startts.org.au/default.aspx?id=201 | title=Refugee Women: The Authentic Heroines | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070830113952/http://www.startts.org.au/default.aspx?id=201 |archivedate=30 August 2007 }} &lt;!-- Must be a more reliable source than this! --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[medical torture]], medical practitioners use torture to judge what victims can endure, to apply treatments that enhance torture, or act as torturers in their own right. [[Josef Mengele]] and [[Shirō Ishii]] were infamous during and after [[World War II]] for their involvement in medical torture and murder. In recent years, however, there has been a push to end medical complicity in torture through both international and state-based legal strategies, as well as litigations against individual physicians.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Hoffman | first = S. J. | year = 2011 | title = Ending medical complicity in state-sponsored torture | url = http://scholar.harvard.edu/files/hoffman/files/25_-_lancet_-_ending_medical_complicity_in_state-sponsored_torture_2011_hoffman.pdf | journal = The Lancet | volume = 378 | issue = 9802 | pages = 1535–1537 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(11)60816-7 | pmid=21944647}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pharmacological torture]] is the use of drugs to produce psychological or physical pain or discomfort. [[Tickle torture]] is an unusual form of torture which nevertheless has been documented, and can be both physically and psychologically painful.&lt;ref&gt;Heger, Heinz.

== Murder ==

{{original research|section|date=February 2017}}
{{Main|Torture murder}}

Torture murder involves torture to the point of murder. [[Murderer]]s might also torture their victims to death for sadistic reasons. [[Al-Qaida|Some terrorist groups]] torture—typically commencing with the forcible extraction of all ten fingernails, all ten toenails, and all thirty-two teeth—before executing the victim by such barbaric techniques as slow decapitation via butcher knife.{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}} Ancient conceptual forerunners of torture murder include [[drawing and quartering]] and [[flaying]].

==Effects==
The consequences of torture reach far beyond immediate pain. Many victims suffer from [[post-traumatic stress disorder]] (PTSD), which includes symptoms such as flashbacks (or intrusive thoughts), severe anxiety, insomnia, nightmares, depression and memory lapses. Torture victims often feel guilt and shame, triggered by the humiliation they have endured. Many feel that they have betrayed themselves or their friends and family. All such symptoms are normal human responses to abnormal and inhuman treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irct.org/what-is-torture/defining-torture.aspx |title= What is torture? |publisher=IRCT |accessdate=7 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Organizations like [[Freedom from Torture]] and the [[Center for Victims of Torture]] try to help survivors of torture obtain medical treatment and to gain [[forensic]] medical [[evidence (law)|evidence]] to obtain [[refugee|political asylum]] in a safe country or to prosecute the perpetrators.

Torture is often difficult to prove, particularly when some time has passed between the event and a medical examination, or when the torturers are immune from prosecution. Many torturers around the world use methods designed to have a maximum psychological impact while leaving only minimal physical traces. Medical and Human Rights Organizations worldwide have collaborated to produce the [[Istanbul Protocol]], a document designed to outline common torture methods, consequences of torture, and medico-legal examination techniques. Typically deaths due to torture are shown in an autopsy as being due to "natural causes" like heart attack, inflammation, or [[embolism]] due to extreme [[stress (medicine)|stress]].&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For survivors, torture often leads to lasting [[mental health|mental]] and physical health problems.

Physical problems can be wide-ranging, e.g. [[sexually transmitted diseases]], musculo-skeletal problems, [[Traumatic brain injury|brain injury]], post-traumatic [[epilepsy]] and [[dementia]] or chronic pain syndromes.

On 19 August 2007, the [[American Psychology Association]] (APA) voted to bar participation, to intervene to stop, and to report involvement in a wide variety of interrogation techniques as torture, including "using [[mock execution]]s, simulated drowning, sexual and religious humiliation, stress positions or sleep deprivation", as well as "the exploitation of prisoners' phobias, the use of mind-altering drugs, [[hooding]], forced nakedness, the use of dogs to frighten detainees, exposing prisoners to extreme heat and cold, physical assault and threatening the use of such techniques against a prisoner or a prisoner's family."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/08/19/AR2007081901513.html|title=APA Rules on Interrogation Abuse|website=washingtonpost.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the APA rejected a stronger resolution that sought to prohibit "all psychologist involvement, either direct or indirect, in any interrogations at U.S. detention centers for foreign detainees or citizens detained outside normal legal channels." That resolution would have placed the APA alongside the American Medical Association and the American Psychiatric Association in limiting professional involvement in such settings to direct patient care. The APA echoed the Bush administration by condemning isolation, sleep deprivation, and sensory deprivation or over-stimulation only when they are likely to cause lasting harm.

Psychiatric treatment of torture-related medical problems might require a wide range of expertise and often specialized experience. Common treatments are [[psychotropic]] [[medication]], e.g. [[selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor|SSRI]] [[antidepressants]], [[counseling]], [[Cognitive Behavioural Therapy]], [[family systems therapy]] and [[physiotherapy]].

:''See [[Psychology of torture]] for psychological impact, and aftermath, of torture.''

==Rehabilitation==

The aim of rehabilitation is to empower the torture victim to resume as full a life as possible. Rebuilding the life of someone whose dignity has been destroyed takes time and as a result long-term material, medical, psychological and social support is needed.&lt;ref name="Rehabilitation"&gt;{{cite web|title=Rehabilitation|url=http://www.irct.org/what-is-torture/rehabilitation.aspx|website=What is torture?|publisher=International Rehabilitation Council for Torture Victims (IRCT)|accessdate=23 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Treatment must be a coordinated effort that covers both physical and psychological aspects. It is important to take into consideration the patients' needs, problems, expectations, views and cultural references.&lt;ref name="Rehabilitation"/&gt;

The consequences of torture are likely to be influenced by many internal and external factors. Therefore, rehabilitation needs to employ different treatment approaches, taking into account the victims' individual needs, as well as the cultural, social and political environment.&lt;ref name="Rehabilitation"/&gt;

Rehabilitation centres around the world, notably the members of the [[International Rehabilitation Council for Torture Victims]], commonly offer multi-disciplinary support and counselling, including:
*medical attention / psychotherapeutic treatment
*psychosocial support / trauma treatment
*legal services and redress
*social reintegration.
In the case of asylum seekers and refugees, the services may also include assisting in documentation of torture for the asylum decision, language classes and help in finding somewhere to live and work.&lt;ref name="Rehabilitation"/&gt;

===Rehabilitation of secondary survivors===
In the worst case, torture can affect several generations. The physical and mental after-effects of torture often place great strain on the entire family and society. Children are particularly vulnerable. They often suffer from feelings of guilt or personal responsibility for what has happened. Therefore, other members of the survivor’s family – in particular the spouse and children – are also offered treatment and counselling.&lt;ref name="Rehabilitation"/&gt;

===Broken societies===
In some instances, whole societies can be more or less traumatized where torture has been used in a systematic and widespread manner. In general, after years of [[Social repression|repression]], [[wikt:conflict|conflict]] and [[war]], regular support networks and structures have often been broken or destroyed.&lt;ref name="Rehabilitation"/&gt;

Providing [[peer support|psychosocial support]] and [[redress]] to survivors of torture and trauma can help reconstruct broken societies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uk.rct.dk/media/1195332/fieldmanual_ver1.pdf|title=Rehabilitation and Research Centre for Torture Victims: Field Manual on Rehabilitation (2007)|publisher=}}{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; "Rehabilitation centres therefore play a key role in promoting democracy, co-existence and respect for human rights. They provide support and hope, and act as a symbol of triumph over the manmade terror of torture which can hold back the development of democracy of entire societies."&lt;ref name="Rehabilitation"/&gt;

'''Transcription''' in the [[linguistics|linguistic]] sense is the systematic representation of [[language]] in written form. The source can either be [[utterance]]s (''speech'' or ''[[sign language]]'') or preexisting [[written language|text]] in another [[writing system]].

Transcription should not be confused with [[translation]], which means representing the meaning of a source language text in a target language (e.g. ''[[Los Angeles]]'' into ''City of Angels'') or with [[transliteration]] which means representing the spelling of a text from one script to another (e.g. ''Jalapeño'', which preserves the Ñ from Spanish despite the [[diacritic]] having no use in English).

In the academic discipline of [[linguistics]], transcription is an essential part of the methodologies of (among others) [[phonetics]], [[conversation analysis]], [[dialectology]] and [[sociolinguistics]]. It also plays an important role for several subfields of [[speech technology]]. Common examples for transcriptions outside academia are the proceedings of a [[court hearing]] such as a [[criminal trial]] (by a [[court reporter]]) or a [[physician]]'s recorded voice notes ([[medical transcription]]). This article focuses on transcription in linguistics.

==Phonetic vs. orthographic transcription==
Broadly speaking, there are two possible approaches to linguistic transcription. [[Phonetic transcription]] focuses on phonetic and phonological properties of spoken language. Systems for phonetic transcription thus furnish rules for mapping individual sounds or [[phone (phonetics)|phones]] to written symbols. Systems for [[orthographic transcription]], by contrast, consist of rules for mapping spoken words onto written forms as prescribed by the [[orthography]] of a given language. Phonetic transcription operates with specially defined character sets, usually the [[International Phonetic Alphabet]].

Which type of transcription is chosen depends mostly on the research interests pursued. Since phonetic transcription strictly foregrounds the phonetic nature of language, it is most useful for phonetic or phonological analyses. Orthographic transcription, on the other hand, has a morphological and a lexical component alongside the phonetic component (which aspect is represented to which degree depends on the language and orthography in question). It is thus more convenient wherever meaning-related aspects of spoken language are investigated. Phonetic transcription is doubtlessly more systematic in a scientific sense, but it is also harder to learn, more time-consuming to carry out and less widely applicable than orthographic transcription.

==As theory==
Mapping spoken language onto written symbols is not as straightforward a process as may seem at first glance. Written language is an idealisation, made up of a limited set of clearly distinct and discrete symbols. Spoken language, on the other hand, is a continuous (as opposed to discrete) phenomenon, made up of a potentially unlimited number of components. There is no predetermined system for distinguishing and classifying these components and, consequently, no preset way of mapping these components onto written symbols.

Literature is relatively consistent in pointing out the nonneutrality of transcription practices. There is not and cannot be a neutral transcription system. Knowledge of social culture enters directly into the making of a transcript. They are captured in the texture of the transcript (Baker, 2005).

==Transcription systems==
Transcription systems are sets of rules which define how spoken language is to be represented in written symbols. Most phonetic transcription systems are based on the [[International Phonetic Alphabet]] or, especially in speech technology, on its derivative [[SAMPA]].
Examples for orthographic transcription systems (all from the field of conversation analysis or related fields) are:

===CA (conversation analysis)===
Arguably the first system of its kind, originally sketched in (Sacks et al. 1978), later adapted for the use in computer readable corpora as ''CA-CHAT'' by (MacWhinney 2000). The field of Conversation Analysis itself includes a number of distinct approaches to transcription and sets of transcription conventions. These include, among others, Jefferson Notation. To analyze conversation, recorded data is typically transcribed into a written form that is agreeable to analysts. There are two common approaches. The first, called narrow transcription, captures the details of conversational interaction such as which particular words are stressed, which words are spoken with increased loudness, points at which the turns-at-talk overlap, how particular words are articulated, and so on. If such detail is less important, perhaps because the analyst is more concerned with the overall gross structure of the conversation or the relative distribution of turns-at-talk amongst the participants, then a second type of transcription known as broad transcription may be sufficient (Williamson, 2009).

====Jefferson Notation====
The Jefferson Notation System is a set of symbols, developed by [[Gail Jefferson]], which is used for transcribing talk. Having had some previous experience in transcribing when she was hired in 1963 as a clerk typist at the UCLA Department of Public Health to transcribe sensitivity-training sessions for prison guards, Jefferson began transcribing some of the recordings that served as the materials out of which Harvey Sacks’ earliest lectures were developed. Over four decades, for the majority of which she held no university position and was unsalaried, Jefferson's research into talk-in-interaction has set the standard for what became known as [[Conversation Analysis]] (CA). Her work has greatly influenced the sociological study of interaction, but also disciplines beyond, especially linguistics, communication, and anthropology.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gail-jefferson.com/obituary.html Obituary – gail-jefferson.com]&lt;/ref&gt; This system is employed universally by those working from the CA perspective and is regarded as having become a near-globalized set of instructions for transcription.&lt;ref&gt;Davidson, C. (2007). Independent writing in current approaches to writing instruction: What have we overlooked? English Teaching: Practice and Critique. Volume 6, Number 1.http://edlinked.soe.waikato.ac.nz/research/files/etpc/files/2007v6n1art1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===DT (discourse transcription)===
A system described in (DuBois et al. 1992), used for transcription of the Santa Barbara Corpus of Spoken American English (SBCSAE), later developed further into ''DT2''.

===GAT (Gesprächsanalytisches Transkriptionssystem – Conversation Analytic transcription system)===
: A system described in (Selting et al. 1998), later developed further into GAT2 (Selting et al. 2009), widely used in German speaking countries for [[Prosody (linguistics)|prosodically]] oriented conversation analysis and interactional linguistics

===HIAT (Halbinterpretative Arbeitstranskriptionen – Semiinterpretative Working Transcriptions)===
: Arguably the first system of its kind, originally described in (Ehlich and Rehbein 1976) – see (Ehlich 1992) for an English reference - adapted for the use in computer readable corpora as (Rehbein et al. 2004), and widely used in functional [[pragmatics]].

==Software==
Transcription was originally a process carried out manually, i.e. with pencil and paper, using an analogue sound recording stored on, e.g., a Compact Cassette. Nowadays, most transcription is done on computers. Recordings are usually digital [[Audio file format|audio]] or [[Container format (digital)|video]] files, and transcriptions are [[electronic document]]s. Specialized computer software exists to assist the transcriber in efficiently creating a digital transcription from a digital recording. Among the most widely used transcription tools in linguistic research are:

'''UNIDROIT Convention on Stolen or Illegally Exported Cultural Objects''' (Rome, 1995) is the international treaty on the subject of cultural property protection. It attempts to strengthen the main weaknesses of the 1970 UNESCO ''Convention on the Means of Prohibiting and Preventing the Illicit Import, Export and Transfer of Ownership of Cultural Property''. The [[UNIDROIT]] Convention seeks to fight the illicit trafficking of cultural property by modifying the buyer's behaviour, obliging him/her to check the legitimacy of their purchase.

==Due diligence and Burden of Proof==
[[File:Claude monet - marina (MCM-RJ) 01.JPG|thumb|[[Claude Monet]]. ''Marina''. Painting stolen from the {{Interlanguage link multi|Museu da Chácara do Céu|pt}}, Rio de Janeiro, in 2006]]

The Convention states that if a cultural property was stolen it must be returned (Chapter II, Art. 3.1).&lt;ref name="Convention"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unidroit.org/instruments/cultural-property/1995-convention|title=''UNIDROIT Convention on stolen or illegally exported  cultural objects''|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=UNIDROIT official website|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=2017-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Any possessor deprived of his/her property will be compensated only if he/she can prove due diligence at the time of the purchase (Chapter II, Art. 4.1). The criteria for due diligence is listed under Article 4.4. of the Convention.

To assess the legitimacy of the object's origin, art market players can use international and national databases dedicated to cultural property protection, for instance, the INTERPOL Stolen Works of Art Database&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.interpol.int/Crime-areas/Works-of-art/Database|title=Works of art / Works of art / Crime areas / Internet / Home - INTERPOL|last=|first=|date=2017-07-26|website=|publisher=Interpol.int|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=2017-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; collects information about stolen cultural property and issues identification numbers to cultural objects.

Whereas Chapter II of the Convention deals with stolen cultural objects, Chapter III contemplates the export of cultural property in violation of national export restrictions. A State Party can request the competent Court of another Contracting State to order the return of a cultural object illegally exported from its territory if the removal of the object caused detriment in one of the ways listed under Article 5.3. Again, the burden of proof is on the possessor to demonstrate that he/she "neither knew nor ought reasonably to have known at the time of acquisition that the object had been illegally exported" (Art. 6.1).

These rules apply equally to cultural objects inherited or received as gifts. Either an heir or a beneficiary has the same responsibility as a buyer. Therefore, museums and other public institutions must carry out checks over the origin of donated objects.&lt;ref name="overview"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unidroit.org/english/conventions/1995culturalproperty/1995culturalproperty-overview-e.pdf | title=The 1995 UNIDROIT Convention on Stolen or Illegally Exported Cultural Objects. An overview | publisher= UNIDROIT official website| accessdate=2012-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The 1970 UNESCO Convention and the 1995 UNIDROIT Convention==

The UNESCO ''Convention on the Means of Prohibiting and Preventing the Illicit Import, Export and Transfer of Ownership of Cultural Property'' (1970 UNESCO Convention) and the UNIDROIT Convention are compatible and complementary. 
As distinct from the UNESCO Convention, the UNIDROIT Convention focuses on the recovery of cultural property. The UNIDROIT Convention establishes conditions for claims of restitution/return of stolen or illegally exported cultural objects respectively.

Although the UNIDROIT Convention follows key terminology of 1970 UNESCO Convention, cultural goods do not need to be defined as such by the State.

Furthermore, the term  "cultural property" is replaced by a more comprehensive "cultural object", but the list of their categories remains the same. The concept of "illicit export" is replaced by "illegal export",  which references a prohibitive law rather than a general forbiddance.

==Time Restrictions to Claims for Repatriation==
[[File:De Grashaven.jpg|thumb|[[Matthias Withoos]]. ''De Grashaven''. Stolen from [[Westfries Museum]], [[Hoorne]], in 2005]]

The Convention regulates the time period that an affected party may bring a claim for the restitution of stolen cultural property or the return of those illegally exported. 
Such a claim may be brought in three years from the time when the claimant knew the location of the cultural property and the identity of the possessor and in 50 years since the time of the theft (Art. 3.3). However, there are exceptions to this rule for stolen objects. 
Cultural objects that form an integral part of an identified monument or archaeological site, or which belong to a public collection are not subject to time limitation other than a period of three years (Art. 3.4). In addition, a Contracting State may declare that a claim warrants an extended time limit of 75 years or longer if so stated in its national law (Art. 3.5).&lt;ref name="convention"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unidroit.org/english/conventions/1995culturalproperty/1995culturalproperty-e.pdf | title=UNIDROIT Convention on stolen or illegally exported  cultural objects | publisher= UNIDROIT official website| accessdate=2012-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The UNIDROIT Convention is not a retroactive treaty. Its provisions only apply to cultural property stolen or illegally exported after the Convention entered into force (Art. 10).&lt;ref name="convention"/&gt; However the UNIDROIT Convention "does not in any way legitimise any illegal transaction of whatever which has taken place before the entry into force of this Convention" and does not "limit any right of a State or other person to make a claim under remedies available outside the framework" of the Convention (Art. 10.3).&lt;ref name="convention"/&gt;

In [[linguistics]], '''veridicality''' is a [[semantic]] or [[grammar|grammatical]] assertion of the truth of an utterance. For example, the statement "Paul saw a snake" asserts the truthfulness of the claim, while "Paul ''did'' see a snake" is an even stronger assertion. [[Negation (linguistics)|Negation]] is veridical, though of opposite [[polarity (grammar)|polarity]], sometimes called ''antiveridical'': "Paul didn't see a snake" asserts that the statement "Paul saw a snake" is false.  In English, [[linguistic modality|non-indicative moods]] are frequently used in a nonveridical sense: "Paul may have seen a snake" and "Paul would have seen a snake" do not assert that Paul actually saw a snake (and the second implies that he did not), though "Paul would indeed have seen a snake" is veridical, and some languages have separate veridical [[conditional mood]]s for such cases.

== In semantic theory ==
The formal definition of veridicality views the context as a [[propositional operator]].

# A propositional operator ''F'' is veridical [[iff]] ''Fp'' entails ''p'': ''Fp'' → ''p''; otherwise ''F'' is nonveridical.
# Additionally, a nonveridical operator ''F'' is antiveridical iff ''Fp'' entails ''not p'': ''Fp'' → ¬''p''.

For [[temporal logic#Temporal operators|temporal]] and [[grammatical aspect|aspectual]] operators, the definition of veridicality is somewhat more complex:

* For operators relative to instants of time: Let ''F'' be a temporal or aspectual operator, and ''t'' an instant of time.
*# ''F'' is veridical iff for ''Fp'' to be true at time ''t'', ''p'' must be true at a (contextually relevant) time ''t&amp;prime;'' ≤ ''t''; otherwise ''F'' is nonveridical.
*# A nonveridical operator ''F'' is antiveridical iff for ''Fp'' to be true at time ''t'', ¬''p'' must be true at a (contextually relevant) time ''t&amp;prime;'' ≤ ''t''.
* For operators relative to intervals of time: Let ''F'' be a temporal or aspectual operator, and ''t'' an interval of time.
*# ''F'' is veridical iff for ''Fp'' to be true of ''t'', ''p'' must be true of all (contextually relevant) ''t&amp;prime;'' ⊆ ''t''; otherwise ''F'' is nonveridical.
*# A nonveridical operator ''F'' is antiveridical iff for ''Fp'' to be true of ''t'', ¬''p'' must be true of all (contextually relevant) ''t&amp;prime;'' ⊆ ''t''.

=== Nonveridical operators ===
Nonveridical operators typically license the use of ''polarity items'', which in veridical contexts normally is ungrammatical:

: * John saw ''any'' students. (The context is veridical.)
: John didn't see ''any'' students. (The context is nonveridical.)

=== Downward entailment ===
All [[Downward entailment|downward entailing]] contexts are nonveridical. Because of this, theories based on nonveridicality can be seen as extending those based on downward entailment, allowing to explain more cases of PI licensing.

Downward entailment predicts that polarity items will be licensed in the scope of [[negation (linguistics)|negation]], downward entailing [[Quantifier (logic)|quantifier]]s like ''few N'', ''at most n N'', ''no N'', and the restriction of ''every'':

: No students saw ''anything''.
: John didn't see ''anything''.
: Few children saw ''anything''.
: Every student who saw ''anything'' should report to the police.

=== Non-monotone quantifiers ===
[[Quantifier (linguistics)|Quantifiers]] like ''exactly three students'', ''nobody but John'', and ''almost nobody'' are non-monotone (and thus not downward entailing) but nevertheless admit ''any'':

: % Exactly three students saw ''anything''.
: Nobody but John saw ''anything''.
: Almost nobody saw ''anything''.

=== ''Hardly'' and ''barely'' ===
''Hardly'' and ''barely'' allow for ''any'' despite not being downward entailing.

: John hardly talked to ''anybody''. (Does not entail "John hardly talked to his mother".)
: John barely studied ''anything''. (Does not entail "John barely studied linguistics".)

=== Questions ===
Polarity items are quite frequent in [[question]]s, although questions are not monotone.

: Did you see ''anything''?

Although questions [[loaded question|biased]] towards the negative answer, such as "Do you &lt;nowiki&gt;[even]&lt;/nowiki&gt; give a damn about any books?" ([[tag question]]s based on negative sentences exhibit even more such bias), can sometimes be seen as downward entailing, this approach cannot account for the general case, such as the above example where the context is perfectly neutral. Neither can it explain why [[negative question]]s, which naturally tend to be biased, don't license negative polarity items.

In semantics which treats a question as the set of its true answers, the [[denotation]] of a polar question contains two possible answers:

: &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Did you see John?]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; = &lt;nowiki&gt;{&lt;/nowiki&gt; you saw John ∨ you didn't see John &lt;nowiki&gt;}&lt;/nowiki&gt;

Because [[disjunction]] ''p'' ∨ ''q'' entails neither ''p'' nor ''q'', the context is nonveridical, which explains the admittance of ''any''.

=== Future ===
Polarity items appear in [[future tense|future]] sentences.

: John will buy ''any'' bottle of wine.
: The children will leave as soon as they discover ''anything''.

According to the formal definition of veridicality for temporal operators, future is nonveridical: that "John will buy a bottle of Merlot" is true ''now'' does not entail that "John buys a bottle of Merlot" is true at any instant up to and including ''now''. On the other hand, [[past tense|past]] is veridical: that "John bought a bottle of Merlot" is true ''now'' entails that there is an instant preceding ''now'' at which "John buys a bottle of Merlot" is true.

=== Habitual aspect ===
Likewise, nonveridicality of the [[habitual aspect]] licenses polarity items.

: He usually reads ''any'' book very carefully.

The habitual aspect is nonveridical because e.g., that "He is usually cheerful" is true over some interval of time does not entail that "He is cheerful" is true over every subinterval of that. This is in contrast to e.g., the [[progressive aspect]], which is veridical and prohibits negative polarity items.

=== Generic sentences ===
Non-monotone generic sentences accept polarity items.

: ''Any'' cat hunts mice.

=== Modal verbs ===
[[Modal verb]]s create generally good environments for polarity items:

: John may talk to ''anybody''.
: ''Any'' minors must be accompanied by their parents.
: The committee can give the job to ''any'' candidate.

Such contexts are nonveridical despite being non-monotone and sometimes even upward entailing ("John must tango" entails "John must dance").

=== Imperatives ===
[[Imperative mood|Imperatives]] are roughly parallel to modal verbs and intensional contexts in general.

: Take ''any'' apple. (cf. "You may/must take ''any'' apple", "I want you to take ''any'' apple".)

=== Protasis of conditionals ===
[[Protasis (linguistics)|Protasis]] of [[conditional sentence|conditionals]] is one of the most common environments for polarity items.

: If you sleep with ''anybody'', I'll kill you.

=== Directive intensional verbs ===
Polarity items are licensed with [[directive modality|directive]] [[propositional attitude]]s but not with [[epistemic]] ones.

: John would like to invite ''any'' student.
: John asked us to invite ''any'' student.
: * John believes that we invited ''any'' student.
: * John dreamt that we invited ''any'' student.
