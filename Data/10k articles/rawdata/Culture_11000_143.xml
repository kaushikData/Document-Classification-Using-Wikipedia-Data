'sociolinguistics' [https://books.google.com/books?id=V5dkKYyHclwC&amp;pg=PA440&amp;dq=social full text]: "Fundamental notions such as 'language' and 'dialect' are primarily social, not linguistic, constructs, because they depend on society in crucial ways."&lt;/ref&gt; and political conditions can have over a community's perception of the status of a language or dialect. The adage was popularized by the sociolinguist and [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]] scholar [[Max Weinreich]], who heard it from a member of the audience at one of his lectures.

==Weinreich==
This statement is usually attributed to [[Max Weinreich]], a specialist in Yiddish linguistics,  who expressed it in Yiddish:
{{Quote|style=text-align: left|{{rtl-para|yi|אַ שפּראַך איז אַ דיאַלעקט מיט אַן אַרמיי און פֿלאָט}}

{{lang|yi-Latn|a shprakh iz a dialekt mit an armey un flot}}}}

The earliest known published source is Weinreich's article ''Der YIVO un di problemen fun undzer tsayt'' ({{lang|yi|דער ייִוואָ און די פּראָבלעמען פֿון אונדזער צײַט|rtl=yes}} "The YIVO Faces the Post-War World"; literally "The YIVO and the problems of our time"), originally presented as a speech on 5 January 1945 at the annual [[YIVO]] conference. Weinreich did not give an English version.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web
 | url = http://download.hebrewbooks.org/downloadhandler.ashx?req=43629
 | title = YIVO Bleter (vol. 25 nr. 1)
 | date = Jan–Feb 1945
 | language = Yiddish
 | accessdate = 2010-08-28
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the article, Weinreich presents this statement as a remark of an auditor at a lecture series given between 13 December 1943 and 12 June 1944:&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web
 | url = http://download.hebrewbooks.org/downloadhandler.ashx?req=43627
 | title = YIVO Bleter (vol. 23 nr. 3)
 | date = May–June 1944
 | language = Yiddish
 | accessdate = 2010-08-28
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{bq|A teacher at a Bronx high school once appeared among the auditors. He had come to America as a child and the entire time had never heard that Yiddish had a history and could also serve for higher matters.... Once after a lecture he approached me and asked, 'What is the difference between a dialect and language?' I thought that the [[maskil]]ic contempt had affected him, and tried to lead him to the right path, but he interrupted me: 'I know that, but I will give you a better definition. A language is a dialect with an army and navy.' From that very time I made sure to remember that I must convey this wonderful formulation of the social plight of Yiddish to a large audience.}}

Weinreich observed that the phrase is a "wonderful expression of the social plight of Yiddish". In his lecture, he discusses not just linguistic, but also broader notions of "[[Yiddishkeit|''yidishkeyt'']]" (ייִדישקייט – lit. [[Jewishness]]).

The [[sociolinguistics|sociolinguist]] and Yiddish scholar [[Joshua Fishman]] suggested that he might have been the auditor at the Weinreich lecture, and has subsequently been cited as the originator of the army-navy statement in several references.{{citation needed|date=October 2010}} However, Fishman was assuming that the exchange took place at a conference in 1967, more than twenty years later than the YIVO lecture (1945) and in any case does not fit Weinreich's description.&lt;ref&gt;

==Other mentions==

Some scholars believe that [[Antoine Meillet]] had earlier said that a language is a dialect with an army, but there is no contemporary documentation of this.&lt;ref&gt;[[William Bright]], editorial note in ''Language in Society'', '''26''':469 (1997): "Some scholars believe that the [Yiddish] saying is an expansion of a quote from [[Antoine Meillet]], to the effect that a language is a dialect with an army. Up to now the source has not been found in the works of Meillet." &lt;/ref&gt;

Jean Laponce suggested in 2004 that [[Hubert Lyautey]] (1854–1934) may have originated the phrase at a meeting of the [[Académie française]], and proposed to call it the "Loi de Lyautey" 'Lyautey's law'.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book
 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=AL-cm5tip2UC&amp;lpg=PA14&amp;vq=%22La%20loi%20de%20Lyautey%22&amp;pg=PA13#v=onepage&amp;q=un%20dialecte%20qui%20a%20une%20arm%C3%A9e&amp;f=false

}}&lt;/ref&gt; But again there is no good evidence for this.{{fact|date=June 2012}}

[[Randolph Quirk]] adapted the definition to "A language is a dialect with an army and a flag" (adding a defense policy and a national airline).&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Burns McArthur: ''The English languages'', p.05&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''American Film Program''' is a Cultural Exchange Program provided by the U.S. Department of State’s [[Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs]].

== Purpose ==
The American Film Program singles out those videos{{Clarification|is the format identified in the legislation as only "video" or any "film" production|date=September 2017}} that it views reflect core American principles, such as "individualism, tolerance, ethnic diversity, social responsibility, trust in the law, and the importance of faith and family."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=American Film Program|url=http://exchanges.state.gov/cultural/american-film-program.html|accessdate=19 March 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120324003038/http://exchanges.state.gov/cultural/american-film-program.html|archive-date=2012-03-24|dead-url=yes|df=}}; https://exchanges.state.gov/search/solr/american%20film%20program&lt;/ref&gt; One of its core functions is to promote intellectual property rights by helping Americans combat piracy and helping the spread of American film in other markets.  Another chief function of the American Film Program is to provide films for the programming of United States [[List of diplomatic missions of the United States|Embassies]] abroad. In addition to providing films for embassy programming, the American Film Program also recruits directors, writers, distributors, anti-piracy experts and other film specialists to share American expertise in the business and creative aspects of filmmaking, such as marketing and distribution, special effects and computer animation.

== American Documentary Showcase ==
The American Documentary Showcase aspect of the American Film Program exhibits independent American films depicting American society culture in foreign countries.  It is administered by the University Film and Video Association.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=American Documentary Showcase |url=http://exchanges.state.gov/cultural/american-film-program/docshowcase.html |accessdate=23 March 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120321002446/http://exchanges.state.gov/cultural/american-film-program/docshowcase.html |archivedate=21 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UFVA - American Documentary Showcase |url=http://www.ufva.org/showcase |accessdate=23 March 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120324153637/http://www.ufva.org/showcase |archivedate=24 March 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Anna Hornby''', N.E.A.C (1914–1996) was an English painter, [[calligrapher]] and member of the [[New English Art Club]].&lt;ref name="Who 1986"&gt;Who's Who in Art (Twenty-Second Edition, Art Trade Press 1986)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life and work==

Anna Hornby was born on 6 April 1914 and educated at the independent [[Westonbirt School]], Gloucestershire.&lt;ref name="Who 1986"/&gt; She went on to study art in [[Florence]] with landscape and flower painter Aubrey Waterfield in 1934, and later that year enrolled at the [[Byam Shaw School of Art]] in London where she studied under [[Francis Ernest Jackson]], graduating in 1940.&lt;ref name="Who 1986"/&gt;

Apart from painting, Calligraphy was Anna's other great passion - in 1952 she was appointed Honorary Secretary of the Society for Italic Handwriting, a post she held until 1962. Through her interest in calligraphy and her association with the Society, she became acquainted with [[Alfred John Fairbank]], whose portrait Anna painted (exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1961).&lt;ref name="archiveshub.ac.uk"&gt;{{Cite web

Anna was also a member of the Art Works’ Guild and was elected member of the [[New English Art Club]] in 1971. She exhibited widely with no fewer than 13 pictures at the Royal Academy, additionally she exhibited at the Royal Society of Painters in Watercolours, The Royal Society of Portrait Painters and the Royal Society of British Artists.&lt;ref&gt;Royal Academy Exhibitors 1905-1970, Vol I (EP Publishing LTD, 1979)&lt;/ref&gt;

Anna Hornby died in 1996, bequeathing paintings by Peter Greenham and Francis Ernest Jackson to the [[Ashmolean]] Museum of Art, Oxford.&lt;ref&gt;Colin Harrison, Catherine Casley, Jon Whiteley

The text of the ballad according to a [[PBS]] radio program:&lt;ref name="PBS - Africans in America - Bars Fight"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/aia/part2/2h1592t.html|title=PBS - Africans in America - "Bars Fight"|publisher=[[PBS]]|accessdate=3 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;poem&gt;
        August 'twas the twenty-fifth,
        Seventeen hundred forty-six;
        The Indians did in ambush lay,
        Some very valiant men to slay,
        The names of whom I'll not leave out.
        Samuel Allen like a hero fout,
        And though he was so brave and bold,
        His face no more shalt we behold
        Eteazer Hawks was killed outright,
        Before he had time to fight, -
        Before he did the Indians see,
        Was shot and killed immediately.
        Oliver Amsden he was slain,
        Which caused his friends much grief and pain.
        Simeon Amsden they found dead,
        Not many rods distant from his head.
        Adonijah Gillett we do hear
        Did lose his life which was so dear.
        John Sadler fled across the water,
        And thus escaped the dreadful slaughter.
        Eunice Allen see the Indians coming,
        And hopes to save herself by running,
        And had not her petticoats stopped her,
        The awful creatures had not catched her,
        Nor tommy hawked her on the head,
        And left her on the ground for dead.
        Young Samuel Allen, Oh lack-a-day!
        Was taken and carried to Canada. 
&lt;/poem&gt;

In North America, '''Belgian waffles''' are a variety of [[waffle]] with a lighter batter, larger squares, and deeper pockets than ordinary American waffles. Belgian waffles were originally leavened with [[Baker's yeast|yeast]], but [[baking powder]] is now often used.&lt;ref name="Roberts" /&gt; They are often eaten as a [[breakfast]] food; toppings vary from whipped cream, confectioners sugar, soft fruit, and [[chocolate]] spread, to syrup and butter or [[margarine]]. They may also be served with vanilla ice cream and fresh fruit (such as strawberries) as a [[dessert]].

In [[Belgium]] itself, there are several kinds of waffle, including the [[Waffle#Varieties|Brussels waffle]] and the [[Waffle#Varieties|Liège waffle]].

==History==
[[File:Worlds Fair - Belgian Village (4626896426).jpg|thumb|upright|float|right|The Belgian Village at the [[1964 New York World's Fair]], where the waffles were popularized]]
Originally showcased in 1958&lt;ref name="CooksInfo" /&gt; at [[Expo 58]] in [[Brussels]], Belgian waffles were introduced to North America by a Belgian named Walter Cleyman at the [[Century 21 Exposition]] in [[Seattle]] in 1962, and served with [[whipped cream]] and strawberries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title= There's Something for All at Seattle's Fair| work= [[Spokane Daily Chronicle]] | date= April 24, 1962| url= https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=C8NWAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=VfcDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6881%2C6359287 |page= 2| via= Google News Archive| access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The waffles were further popularized in the United States during the [[1964 New York World's Fair]]&lt;ref name="Roberts"&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/27/nyregion/thecity/27read.html |title= A Fair, a Law and the Urban Walker |last=Roberts|first=Sam| work= [[The New York Times]] |accessdate=2009-03-19 | date=2008-07-27| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20131113114709/http://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/27/nyregion/thecity/27read.html| archivedate=November 13, 2013 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; at [[Flushing Meadows Park]] in [[Queens]], [[New York City]]. These waffles were introduced by Maurice Vermersch of [[Brussels]], Belgium.{{cn|date= July 2018}} Largely based on a simplified recipe for the Brussels waffles, Vermersch decided to change the name to the Bel-Gem Waffle upon observing that many Americans could not correctly identify Brussels as the capital of Belgium.&lt;ref name="Newsday"&gt;{{cite news|title=His waffles made memories at the Queens World's Fair| date= 1989-08-22| work= [[Newsday]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DOJMAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=RA2-PA554 |title= Waffles | page= 554| work= The Oxford Encyclopedia of Food and Drink in America |via=[[Google Books]] |year= 2013 |first= Bruce| last= Kraig| |accessdate=2014-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; These waffles were served with whipped cream and strawberries, and they were sold for a dollar.&lt;ref name="CooksInfo"&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.cooksinfo.com/belgian-waffles|title=Belgian Waffles| work= CooksInfo.com |accessdate=2009-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The bride and/or groom are 'captured' by friends and family, covered in food, or a variety of other - preferably adhesive - substances, then  paraded publicly for the community to see. 


Frequently, the couple are driven in the back of an open-backed truck, accompanied by the clattering and banging of pots and pans by the couple's 'captors'. There are no strict rules regarding the act of blackening itself, only that the couple must be rendered messy and uncomfortable, and that as many people as possible should witness the occasion.&lt;ref&gt;Bennett, Margaret: 'Scottish Customs From the Cradle to the Grave', (Polygon, 1992), pg.112-113.

The most famous occurrence was performed on Melanie Richmond, she was covered in tripe, pigs blood and feathers before marching from Elgin to Aberdeen over the course of five days.

Blackenings occur predominantly in rural areas of [[north-east Scotland]], the [[Scottish Highlands|Highlands]] and the [[Northern Isles]]. The origins of the custom are obscure, however  researcher, Dr. Sheila Young of the Elphinstone Institute, [[University of Aberdeen]] has shown that the blackening has evolved from an earlier Scottish ritual called the feet-washing. There is uncertainty surrounding just when it began, but it probably started as a solemn washing ritual for both men and women on the eve of their wedding and included a blackening of the feet and legs by the early 19th century. A little later, it had developed into a kind of a game, with the legs and feet being alternately blackened and scrubbed clean, and then by the end of the 19th century early 20th century escape, capture, [[tar and feathering]], and [[pillory]]ing had become part of the ritual. In order for this to happen the ritual had to move out of doors. The move out of doors appears to have coincided with a change in wedding practices, with more people marrying in the summer months. A ritual, which began as a washing ceremony, developed into a dirtying ceremony. It is probable then, that a change in the form of the ritual led to a change in name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Young|first1=Sheila|title=Medieval torture, or just a bit of fun?|journal=Leopard Magazine|date=June 2016|pages=26–28|publisher=University of Aberdeen|issn=2053-9851}}&lt;/ref&gt; The blackening's roots are  Scottish, though a similar practice, called a doing, is to be found in Northern Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;Young, Sheila, 'The Evolution of the Contemporary Blackening', ''Folklore'' 128 (3), 2017, 244-270&lt;/ref&gt;

The only complete surviving figure of a larger arrangement of figures. This is the earliest three dimensional representation of the bull leap. It is assumed that thin gold pins were used to suspend the figure over a bull.]]

'''Bull-leaping''' ({{lang-grc|ταυροκαθάψια}}, {{lang|grc-Latn|[[wikt:taurokathapsia|taurokathapsia]]}}&lt;ref&gt;The name of a ritual bull-fight held on occasion of a festival in [[Thessaly]] (scholion to [[Pindar]], ''Pythian Odes'' 2.78), at [[Smyrna]] ([[Corpus Inscriptionum Graecarum|CIG]] 3212) and at [[Sinop, Turkey|Sinope]] (CIG 4157).&lt;/ref&gt;) is a form of non-violent [[bull fighting]] based on an ancient ritual involving an acrobat leaping over the back of a charging bull (or cow). The sport survives in modern [[France]], usually with cows rather than bulls, as {{lang|fr|[[course landaise]]}}; and in Spain, with bulls, as {{lang|es|[[Bullfighting#Recortes|recortes]]}}.  [[Ritual]] leaping over bulls is a motif of [[Middle Bronze Age]] figurative art, notably of [[Minoan Crete]], but also found in [[Hittite Empire|Hittite Anatolia]], the [[Levant]], [[Bactria–Margiana Archaeological Complex|Bactria]] and the [[Indus Valley Civilization|Indus Valley]].&lt;ref&gt;One argument for the association of Minoan Crete with the Bronze Age culture of the Indus Valley by H. Mode (''Indische Frühkulturen und ihre Beziehungen zum Westen'', Basel, 1944); since the 1940s, further bull-leaping motives have been discovered in 2nd millennium BC contexts in Bactria and northern Anatolia.&lt;/ref&gt; It is often interpreted as a depiction of a [[rite]] performed in connection with [[bull worship]].

==Iconography==
Younger (1995) classifies bull-leaping depictions as follows:
* Type I: the [[acrobatics|acrobat]] approaches the bull from the front, grabs the horns, and somersaults backwards
* Type II: the acrobat approaches the bull from the front, dives over the horns without touching them and pushes himself with his hands from the bull's back into a backward somersault
* Type III: the acrobat is depicted in mid-air over the bull's back, facing the same way as the animal

The Type III depictions are often found in Late Minoan IIIB artwork (14th to 13th centuries BC). Frescoes in [[Tell el-Dab'a]] ([[Avaris]], Egypt) dating to the [[18th dynasty]] (16th to 14th centuries BC) show similar designs besides genuinely Egyptian motifs, for which reason they have usually been ascribed to Minoan-taught Egyptian craftsmen (rather than to Minoan ones directly). They could also have been included as palace decorations because the palace was built for an Aegean princess diplomatically married to a Hyksos pharaoh.&lt;ref&gt;Rohl, David, The Lords of Avaris, Random House, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other examples of bull-leaping scenes have been found in [[Syria]], such as a [[cylinder seal]] impression found in level VII at [[Alalakh]] ([[First Babylonian Dynasty|Old Babylonian]] period, 19th or 18th century BC) showing two acrobats performing handstands on the back of a bull, with an [[ankh]] sign placed between them, another seal belonging to a servant of [[Shamshi-Adad I]] (c. 1800 BC), besides other Syrian examples.  Furthermore, a [[Hüseyindede vases#vase B|relief vase]] was discovered in [[Hüseyindede]] in 1997, dating to the [[Hittite Old Kingdom]] (18th to 15th centuries BC).

==Minoan Crete==
[[File:Minoan Bull-leaper.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Minoan Bull-leaper]] sculpture at the [[British Museum]].]]
Bull-leaping is thought to have been a key ritual in the religion of the [[Minoan civilization]] in [[Bronze Age]] [[Crete]]. As in the case of other [[Mediterranean]] civilizations, the [[bull]] was the [[Bull (mythology)|subject of veneration and worship]]. Representation of the Bull at the palace of [[Knossos]] is a widespread symbol in the art and decoration of this archaeological site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Hogan |first=C. Michael |url= http://www.themodernantiquarian.com/site/10854/knossos.html#fieldnotes |title=Knossos: Fieldnotes |work=The Modern Antiquarian |date=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The assumption, widely debated by scholars, is that the iconography represents a ritual sport and/or performance in which human athletes literally vaulted over bulls as part of a ceremonial rite.  This ritual it hypothesized to have consisted of an acrobatic leap over a bull, such that when the leaper grasped the bull's horns, the bull would violently jerk its neck upwards, giving the leaper the momentum necessary to perform somersaults and other acrobatic tricks or stunts.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

==Contemporary bull-leaping==
[[Image:Goya Tauromachia4.jpg|right|thumb|300px|The Speed and Daring of Juanito Apiñani in the Ring of Madrid (1815-16). Etching and aquatint by [[Francisco Goya|Francisco de Goya]].]]
[[Image:Sauteur.JPG|thumb|300px|A "leaper" in 2006]]
Bull-leaping is still practiced in southwestern [[France]], where it is traditionally known as the {{lang|fr|[[course landaise]]}}, although usually aggressive cows are used instead of bulls. They are the female stock of the fighting bulls bred for the [[Spanish-style bullfighting|{{lang|es|corrida|nocat=y}} in Spain]]. However, once per year bulls are used, in the Festival of Art and Courage. The town of [[Mont-de-Marsan]] in [[Gascony]] is renowned for its fine {{lang|fr|sauteurs}} or 'leapers' and {{lang|fr|écarteurs}} ('dodgers') dressed in brocaded waistcoats. They compete in teams, attempting to use their repertoire evasions and acrobatic leaps to avoid the cow's charges.

The cow is typically guided by the use of a long rope attached to its horns, so that it runs directly at the performers and is restrained from trampling or goring them should they miss a trick. Although there is little to no risk to the cow in this form of contest, it is a highly dangerous sport for the human participants; a prominent one from [[Communauté de communes du Montois|Montois]], Jean-Pierre Rachou, was killed in 2001 when he fell on his head after being hit by a cow.

The {{lang|fr|courses landaises}} are held from March to October on the occasion of festivals in many cities and villages, including [[Nogaro]], [[Mont-de-Marsan]], [[Dax, Landes|Dax]], [[Castelnau-d'Auzan]], and many other places. There are also national championships.

A similar but even more dangerous tradition of non-violent bull-leaping, {{lang|es|[[Bullfighting#Recortes|recortes]]}}, is practiced in some parts of Spain. Specialists {{lang|es|[[torero]]s}} (bullfighters), known as {{lang|es|recortadores}}, compete at dodging and leaping over bulls without the use of the cape or sword. Some {{lang|es|recortadores}} use a long pole to literally [[Pole vault|pole-vault]] over the charging animal, which is both larger than the type used in the French sport, and unrestrained by any guiding rope or similar safety device.

The '''Centre de musique romantique française''' ("centre for French [[Romantic music]]") is a French-administered cultural institution, research centre and concert hall, in [[Venice]], in north-eastern Italy. It is housed in the Palazzetto Bru Zane, an annex to the {{illm|Palazzo Zane Collalto|it}}, on the {{illm|Rio Marin, Venice|fr|Rio Marin|lt=Rio Marin}} in the [[sestiere]] of [[San Polo]]. The centre opened in October 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=L'express international|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_tUeAQAAMAAJ|series=3001-3017|date=January 2009|publisher=Groupe Express|language=French|pages=61–|quote=Cette entreprise a été confiée à Renzo Piano, l'un des deux architectes du Centre Pompidou.

== The Palazzetto ==

In 1695, Marino Zane (1639–1709) commissioned the construction of a library (no longer extant) and a casino (Italian for ‘small house, lodge’; now the palazzetto) next to the residence of the old-established family Zane, the {{illm|Palazzo Zane Collalto|it}}.&lt;ref&gt;Massimo Favilla and Ruggero Rugolo, Notes sur l’histoire du casino Zane à San Stin, in: ''Le palazzetto Bru Zane. Histoire et renaissance'', Venice 2009, pp. 5–27.&lt;/ref&gt; The new buildings were intended to house his collection of books and paintings and to serve as a venue for art, music, and amusement. The architect [[Antonio Gaspari]] was responsible for the interior decoration of the casino.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bru-zane.com/?chi_siamo=il-casino-zane&amp;lang=en ''The Casino Zane''] Official Website.

The history of '''Chinese literature''' extends thousands of years, from the earliest recorded dynastic court [[archive]]s to the mature [[Written vernacular Chinese|vernacular fiction]] novels that arose during the [[Ming Dynasty]] to entertain the masses of literate Chinese. The introduction of widespread [[woodblock printing]] during the [[Tang Dynasty]] (618–907) and the invention of [[movable type]] [[printing]] by [[Bi Sheng]] (990–1051) during the [[Song Dynasty]] (960–1279) rapidly spread written knowledge throughout China. In more modern times, the author [[Lu Xun]] (1881–1936) is considered the founder of ''[[Vernacular Chinese|baihua]]'' literature in China.

== Pre-classical period ==
Formation of the earliest layer of Chinese literature was influenced by oral traditions of different social and professional provenance: cult and lay musical practices (''[[Shijing]]''),&lt;ref&gt;Chen Zhi, The Shaping of the Book of Songs, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; divination (''[[Yi jing]]''), astronomy, exorcism. An attempt at tracing the genealogy of Chinese literature to religious spells and incantations (the six ''zhu'' 六祝, as presented in the "Da zhu" chapter of the ''[[Rites of Zhou]]'') was made by Liu Shipei.&lt;ref&gt;刘师培，《文学出于巫祝之官说》&lt;/ref&gt;

== Classical texts ==
{{Main|Chinese classics|List of Chinese language poets}}
There is a wealth of early Chinese literature dating from the [[Hundred Schools of Thought]] that occurred during the [[Zhou Dynasty|Eastern Zhou Dynasty]] (770–256 BC). The most important of these include the Classics of [[Confucianism]], of [[Taoism|Daoism]], of [[Mohism]], of [[Legalism (Chinese philosophy)|Legalism]], as well as works of military science and [[History of China|Chinese history]]. Note that, except for the books of poems and songs, most of this literature is philosophical and didactic; there is little in the way of fiction. However, these texts maintained their significance through both their ideas and their prose style.

The Confucian works in particular have been of key importance to Chinese culture and history, as a set of works known as the ''Four Books and Five Classics'' were, in the 12th century AD, chosen as the basis for the [[Imperial examination]] for any government post. These nine books therefore became the center of the educational system. They have been grouped into two categories: the ''[[Five Classics]]'', allegedly commented and edited by [[Confucius]], and the [[Four Books]]. The ''Five Classics'' are:
#the ''[[I Ching]]'', or ''Book of Changes'', a [[divination]] manual;{{refn|group=note|Attributed to the mythical emperor [[Fu Xi]] and based on [[Bagua (concept)|eight trigrams]], the ''I Ching'' is still used by adherents of [[Chinese folk religion]].}}
#the ''[[Classic of Poetry]]'', a collection of poems, folk songs, festival and ceremonial songs, hymns and eulogies;
#the ''[[Classic of Rites]]'' or ''Record of Rites'';
#the ''[[Classic of History]]'', an early Chinese prose collection of documents and speeches allegedly written by rulers and officials of the early [[Zhou Dynasty|Zhou period]] and earlier;
#the ''[[Spring and Autumn Annals]]'', a historical record of Confucius' native state, [[Lu (state)|Lu]], from 722 to 479 BC.

The ''Four Books'' are:
#the ''[[Analects of Confucius]]'', a book of pithy sayings attributed to Confucius and recorded by his disciples;
#the ''[[Mencius (book)|Mencius]]'', a collection of political dialogues;
#the ''[[Doctrine of the Mean]]'', a book that teaches the path to Confucian virtue; and
#the ''[[Great Learning]]'', a book about education, self-cultivation and the [[Tao|Dao]].

Other important{{according to whom|date=February 2016}} philosophical works include the Mohist ''[[Mozi]]'', which taught "inclusive love" as both an ethical and social principle, and ''[[Hanfeizi]]'', one of the central Legalist texts.

Important [[Taoism|Daoist]] classics include the ''[[Dao De Jing]]'', the ''[[Zhuangzi (book)|Zhuangzi]]'', and the ''[[Classic of the Perfect Emptiness]]''. Later authors combined Daoism with Confucianism and Legalism, such as [[Liu An]] (2nd century BC), whose ''[[Huainanzi]]'' (''The Philosophers of Huai-nan'') also added to the fields of [[History of geography#China|geography]] and [[topography]].

Among the classics of military science, ''[[The Art of War]]''  by [[Sun Tzu]]  (6th century BC) was perhaps the first to outline guidelines for effective international [[diplomacy]]. It was also the first in a tradition of Chinese military treatises, such as the ''[[Jingling Zongyao]]'' (''Collection of the Most Important Military Techniques'', 1044 AD) and the ''[[Woolongong]]'' (''Fire Dragon Manual'', 14th century AD).

== Historical texts, dictionaries and encyclopedias ==

{{Further|:Category:Chinese encyclopedias|Chinese dictionary}}
[[File:Si maqian.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Sima Qian]] laid the ground for professional [[Chinese historiography]] more than 2,000 years ago.]]
The Chinese kept consistent and accurate court records after the year 841 BC, with the beginning of the [[Gonghe Regency]] of the [[Western Zhou Dynasty]]. The earliest known [[narrative history]] of China was the ''[[Zuo Zhuan]]'', which was compiled no later than 389 BC, and attributed to the blind 5th-century BC historian [[Zuo Qiuming]]. The ''[[Book of Documents]]'' is thought to have been compiled as far back as the 6th century BC, and was certainly compiled by the 4th century BC, the latest date for the writing of the [[Guodian Chu Slips]] unearthed in a [[Hubei]] tomb in 1993. The ''Book of Documents'' included [[History of geography|early information on geography]] in the ''[[Yu Gong]]'' chapter.&lt;ref name="needham volume 3 500 501"&gt;Needham, Volume 3, 500–501.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Bamboo Annals]]'' found in 281 AD in the tomb of the King of Wei, who was interred in 296 BC, provide another example; however, unlike the ''Zuo Zhuan'', the authenticity of the early date of the ''Bamboo Annals'' is in doubt. Another early text was the political strategy book of the ''[[Zhan Guo Ce]]'', compiled between the 3rd and 1st centuries BC, with [[Mawangdui Silk Texts|partial amounts of the text]] found amongst the 2nd century BC [[Mawangdui|tomb site]] at [[Mawangdui]]. The oldest extant [[dictionary]] in China is the ''[[Erya]]'', dated to the 3rd century BC, anonymously written but with later commentary by the historian [[Guo Pu]] (276–324). Other early dictionaries include the ''[[Fangyan]]'' by [[Yang Xiong (author)|Yang Xiong]] (53 BC&amp;nbsp;– 18 AD) and the ''[[Shuowen Jiezi]]'' by [[Xu Shen]] (58–147 AD). One of the largest was the ''[[Kangxi Dictionary]]'' compiled by 1716 under the auspices of the [[Kangxi Emperor]] (r. 1661–1722); it provides definitions for over 47,000 characters.

Although court records and other independent records existed beforehand, the definitive work in early Chinese historical writing was the ''[[Shiji]]'', or ''Records of the Grand Historian'' written by [[Han Dynasty]] court historian [[Sima Qian]] (145 BC – 90 BC). This groundbreaking text laid the foundation for Chinese historiography and the many official Chinese historical texts compiled for each dynasty thereafter. Sima Qian is often compared to the Greek [[Herodotus]] in scope and method, because he covered Chinese history from the mythical [[Xia Dynasty]] until the contemporary reign of [[Emperor Wu of Han]] while retaining an objective and non-biased standpoint. This was often difficult for the official dynastic historians, who used historical works to justify the reign of the current dynasty. He influenced the written works of many Chinese historians, [[Book of Han|including the works]] of [[Ban Gu]] and [[Ban Zhao]] in the 1st and 2nd centuries, and even [[Sima Guang]]'s 11th-century compilation of the ''[[Zizhi Tongjian]]'', presented to [[Emperor Shenzong of Song]] in 1084 AD. The overall scope of the historiographical tradition in China is termed the [[Twenty-Four Histories]], created for each successive Chinese dynasty up until the [[Ming Dynasty]] (1368–1644); China's last dynasty, the [[Qing Dynasty]] (1644–1911), is not included.

Large encyclopedias were also produced in China through the ages. The ''[[Yiwen Leiju]]'' encyclopedia was completed by [[Ouyang Xun]] in 624 during the [[Tang Dynasty]], with aid from scholars [[Linghu Defen]] and [[Chen Shuda]]. During the [[Song Dynasty]], the compilation of the [[Four Great Books of Song]] (10th century&amp;nbsp;– 11th century), begun by [[Li Fang (Song dynasty)|Li Fang]] and completed by [[Cefu Yuangui]], represented a massive undertaking of written material covering a wide range of different subjects. This included the ''[[Tàipíng guǎngjì|Extensive Records of the Taiping Era]]'' (978), the ''[[Imperial Readings of the Taiping Era]]'' (983),  the ''[[Finest Blossoms in the Garden of Literature]]'' (986), and the ''[[Prime Tortoise of the Record Bureau]]'' (1013). Although these Song Dynasty Chinese encyclopedias featured millions of written [[Chinese characters]] each, their aggregate size paled in comparison to the later ''[[Yongle Encyclopedia]]'' (1408) of the Ming Dynasty, which contained a total of 50 million Chinese characters.&lt;ref name="ebrey 272"&gt;Ebrey (2006), 272.&lt;/ref&gt; Even this size was trumped by later Qing Dynasty encyclopedias, such as the printed ''[[Gujin Tushu Jicheng]]'' (1726), which featured over 100 million written Chinese characters in over 800,000 pages, printed in 60 different copies using [[copper]]-metal Chinese [[movable type]] printing. Other great encyclopedic writers include the polymath scientist [[Shen Kuo]] (1031–1095) and his ''[[Dream Pool Essays]]'', the agronomist and inventor [[Wang Zhen (official)|Wang Zhen]] ([[floruit|fl.]] 1290–1333) and his ''[[Wang Zhen (official)#Life and works|Nongshu]]'', and the minor scholar-official [[Song Yingxing]] (1587–1666) and his ''[[Song Yingxing#Written works|Tiangong Kaiwu]]''.

== Classical poetry ==
{{Main|Classical Chinese poetry}}
[[File:Bai Juyi by Chen Hongshou.jpg|thumb|upright|150px|[[Bai Juyi]] (772–846), a famous [[Tang Dynasty]] poet and statesman.]]
The rich tradition of Chinese poetry began with two influential collections. In northern China, the ''Shijing'' or ''[[Classic of Poetry]]'' (approx. 10th–7th century BC) comprises over 300 poems in a variety of styles ranging from those with a strong suggestion of folk music to ceremonial hymns.&lt;ref&gt;Cai 2008, p. 13 et seq., Chapter 1&lt;/ref&gt; The word ''[[Shi (poetry)|shi]]'' has the basic meaning of poem or poetry, as well as its use in criticism to describe one of China's lyrical poetic genres. [[Confucius]] is traditionally credited with editing the ''Shijing''. Its stately verses are usually composed of couplets with lines of four characters each (or four syllables, as Chinese characters are monosyllabic), and a formal structure of end rhymes. Many of these early poems establish the later tradition of starting with a description of nature that leads into emotionally expressive statements, known as ''bi'', ''xing'', or sometime ''bixing''.&lt;ref&gt;Lin and Owen 1986, pp. 342–343 regarding ''xing''; Cai 2008, p. 8, 43 on ''bixing'', and p. 113 on the development and expansion of ''bixing'' after its ''Shijing'' beginnings&lt;/ref&gt; Associated with what was then considered to be southern China, the ''[[Chuci]]'' is ascribed to [[Qu Yuan]] (c. 340–278 BC) and his follower [[Song Yu]] (fl. 3rd century BC) and is distinguished by its more emotionally intense affect, often full of despair and descriptions of the fantastic.&lt;ref&gt;Cai 2008, p. 36 et seq., Chapter 2&lt;/ref&gt; In some of its sections, the ''Chu Ci '' uses a six-character per line meter, dividing these lines into couplets separated in the middle by a strong [[caesura]], producing a driving and dramatic rhythm. Both the ''Shijing'' and the ''Chuci'' have remained influential throughout Chinese history.

During the greater part of China's first great period of unification, begun with the short-lived [[Qin Dynasty]] (221 BC – 206 BC) and followed by the centuries-long [[Han Dynasty]] (206 BC – 220 AD), the ''[[Shi (poetry)|shi]]'' form of poetry underwent little innovation. But a distinctively descriptive and erudite ''[[Fu (literature)|fu]]'' form (not the same ''fu'' character as that used for the bureau of music) developed that has been called "rhyme-prose," a uniquely Han offshoot of Chinese poetry's tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Cai 2008, p. 59 et seq., Chapter 3&lt;/ref&gt; Equally noteworthy is [[Music Bureau]] poetry (''[[yuefu]]''), collected and presumably refined popular lyrics from folk music.  The end of the Han witnesses a resurgence of the ''shi'' poetry, with the anonymous ''[[Nineteen Old Poems|19 Old Poems]]''.  This collection reflects the emergence of a distinctive five-character line that later became ''shi'' poetry's most common line length.&lt;ref&gt;Cai 2008, p. 103 et seq., Chapter 5&lt;/ref&gt; From the [[Jian'an poetry|Jian'an]] reign period (196 – 220 AD) onward, the five-character line became a focus for innovations in style and theme.&lt;ref&gt;Lin and Owen 1986, pp. 346–347&lt;/ref&gt; The Cao family,&lt;ref&gt;Lin and Owen 1986, p. 136&lt;/ref&gt; rulers of the [[Cao Wei|Wei Dynasty]] (220 – 265 AD) during the post-Han [[Three kingdoms|Three Kingdoms]] period, distinguished themselves as poets by writing poems filled with sympathy for the day-to-day struggles of soldiery and the common people. Taoist philosophy became a different, common theme for other poets, and a genre emphasizing true feeling emerged led by [[Ruan Ji]] (210–263).&lt;ref&gt;Watson 1971, pp. 69–70&lt;/ref&gt; The landscape genre of Chinese nature poetry emerged under the brush of [[Xie Lingyun]] (385–433), as he innovated distinctively descriptive and complementary couplets composed of five-character lines.&lt;ref&gt;Lin and Owen 1986, p. 125&lt;/ref&gt; A farmland genre was born in obscurity by [[Tao Yuanming|Tao Qian]] (365–427) also known as Tao Yuanming as he labored in his fields and then wrote extolling the influence of wine.&lt;ref&gt;Cai 2008, pp. 121–129&lt;/ref&gt; Toward the close of this period in which many later-developed themes were first experimented with, the [[Xiao (surname)|Xiao]] family&lt;ref&gt;Lin and Owen 1986, p. 158&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[Liang Dynasty|Southern Liang Dynasty]] (502–557) engaged in highly refined and often denigrated&lt;ref&gt;Contemporary criticism by Watson 1971, "stilted," "effete," "trying" at p. 105, "weakness," "banality," "badness of style," "triviality," "repetitiousness," "beyond recovery" at p. 107, "ridiculous" at p. 108; Tang Dynasty criticism by Li Bai at Lin and Owen 1986, p. 164&lt;/ref&gt; court-style poetry lushly describing sensual delights as well as the description of objects.

Reunified China's [[Tang Dynasty]] (618–907) high culture set a high point for many things, including poetry. Various schools of [[Buddhism]] (a religion from India) flourished as represented by the [[Chinese Chán|Chan]] (or Zen) beliefs of [[Wang Wei (Tang dynasty)|Wang Wei]] (701–761).&lt;ref&gt;Watson 1971, pp. 169–172&lt;/ref&gt; His quatrains (''[[jueju]]'') describing natural scenes are world-famous examples of excellence, each couplet conventionally containing about two distinct images or thoughts per line.&lt;ref&gt;Cheng 1982, p. 37, and pp. 56–57 on the non-linear dynamic this creates&lt;/ref&gt; Tang poetry's big star is [[Li Bai]] (701–762) also pronounced and written as Li Bo, who worked in all major styles, both the more free old style verse (''[[Gushi (poetry)|gutishi]]'') as well as the tonally regulated new style verse (''[[Regulated verse|jintishi]]'').&lt;ref&gt;Watson 1971, pp. 141–153 generally; Cheng 1982, p. 65 and Cai 2008, p. 226 regarding ''gutishi'' and ''jintishi''&lt;/ref&gt; Regardless of genre, Tang poets notably strove to perfect a style in which poetic subjects are exposed and evident, often without directly referring to the emotional thrust at hand.&lt;ref&gt;Lin and Owen 1986, pp. 316–317, p. 325 regarding ''jueju''; Watson 1971, pp. 172–173 on plainness in Wang Wei; more generally, taking from the above reference to ''bi'' and ''xing'', the objectivity of depicting nature has a conventional carryover to depicting emotion, for example by explicitly depicting the poet's own shed tears as if from a detached point of view&lt;/ref&gt; The poet [[Du Fu]] (712–770) excelled at regulated verse and use of the seven-character line, writing denser poems with more allusions as he aged, experiencing hardship and writing about it.&lt;ref&gt;Watson 1971, pp. 153–169 generally; Lin and Owen 1986, p. 375 et seq., particularly regarding use of the seven-character line&lt;/ref&gt; A parade of great Tang poets also includes [[Chen Zi'ang]] (661–702), [[Wang Zhihuan]] (688–742), [[Meng Haoran]] (689–740), [[Bai Juyi]] (772–846), [[Li He]] (790–816), [[Du Mu]] (803–852), [[Wen Tingyun]] (812–870), (listed chronologically) and [[Li Shangyin]] (813–858), whose poetry delights in allusions that often remain obscure,&lt;ref&gt;Liu 1962, pp. 137–141&lt;/ref&gt; and whose emphasis on the seven-character line also contributed to the emerging posthumous fame of Du Fu,&lt;ref&gt;Lin and Owen 1986, p. 375&lt;/ref&gt; now ranked alongside Li Bai. The distinctively different ''[[Ci (poetry)|ci]]'' poetry form began its development during the Tang as Central Asian and other musical influences flowed through its cosmopolitan society.&lt;ref&gt;Watson 1984, p. 353 on Dunhuang Caves discovery; Cai 2008, pp. 248–249&lt;/ref&gt;

China's [[Song Dynasty]] (960–1279), another reunification era after a brief period of disunity, initiated a fresh high culture. Several of its greatest poets were capable government officials as well including [[Ouyang Xiu]] (1007–1072), [[Su Shi]] (1037–1101), and [[Wang Anshi]] (1021–1086). The ''[[Ci (poetry)|ci]]'' form flourished as a few hundred songs became standard templates for poems with distinctive and variously set meters.&lt;ref&gt;Cai 2008, p. 245 et seq., Chapters 12–14&lt;/ref&gt; The free and expressive style of Song high culture has been contrasted with majestic Tang poems by centuries of subsequent critics who engage in fierce arguments over which dynasty had the best poetry.&lt;ref&gt;Chaves 1986, p. 7 on Ming advocates of Tang superiority; Cai 2008, p. 308, "it has long been fashionable, ever since the Song itself, for poets and critics to think of the poetry of the Song as stylistically distinct from that of the Tang, and to debate its merits relative to the earlier work."&lt;/ref&gt; Additional musical influences contributed to the [[Yuan Dynasty]]'s (1279–1368) distinctive ''[[Qu (poetry)|qu]]'' opera culture and spawned the ''[[sanqu]]'' form of individual poems based on it.&lt;ref&gt;Cai 2008, p. 329 et seq., Chapter 16&lt;/ref&gt;

Classical Chinese poetry composition became a conventional skill of the well-educated throughout the [[Ming Dynasty|Ming]] (1368–1644) and [[Qing Dynasty|Qing]] (1644–1911) dynasties. Over a million poems have been preserved, including those by women, such as [[Dong Xiaowan]] and [[Liu Rushi]], and by many other diverse voices.&lt;ref&gt;Cai 2008, p. 354 et seq., Chapter 17; Cai 2008, p. 376 fn. 2 notes effort to compile complete collection of Ming poetry began in 1990&lt;/ref&gt; Painter-poets, such as [[Shen Zhou]] (1427–1509), [[Tang Yin]] (1470–1524), [[Wen Zhengming]] (1470–1559), and [[Yun Shouping]] (1633–1690), created worthy conspicuous poems as they combined art, poetry and calligraphy with brush on paper.&lt;ref&gt;Chaves 1986, pp. 8–9&lt;/ref&gt; Poetry composition competitions were socially common, as depicted in novels, for example over dessert after a nice dinner.&lt;ref&gt;The novel ''Dream of the Red Chamber'' has many examples of competitive poetic composition but most apt is the drinking game after dinner at Feng Ziying's in Chapter 28, which includes each guest composing a line apiece about a girl's sorrow, worry, joy, and delight; transposing the real to the fantastic, Chapter 64 of ''Journey to the West'' includes an otherworldly competition between the pilgrim monk and four immortal tree spirits&lt;/ref&gt; The Song versus Tang debate continues through the centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Attesting to the debate's survival a previous version of this page contained the assertion (to which a Wikipedia editor asked "by whom?"): "Subsequent writers of classical poetry lived under the shadow of their Tang predecessors, and although there were many poets in subsequent dynasties, none reached the level of this period."&lt;/ref&gt; While China's later imperial period does not seem to have broken new ground for innovative approaches to poetry, picking through its vast body of preserved works remains a scholarly challenge, so new treasures may yet be restored from obscurity.&lt;ref&gt;Chaves 1986, p. 6, "The sheer quantity of Ming poetry, the quality of so much of it, and its stylistic richness and diversity all cry out for serious attention."&lt;/ref&gt;

== Classical prose ==
Early Chinese prose was deeply influenced by the great philosophical writings of the [[Hundred Schools of Thought]] (770–221 BC). The works of [[Mo Zi]] (墨子), [[Mencius]] (孟子) and [[Zhuang Zhou|Zhuang Zi]] (莊子) contain well-reasoned, carefully developed discourses that reveal much stronger organization and style than their predecessors. Mo Zi's polemic prose was built on solid and effective methodological reasoning. Mencius contributed elegant diction and, like Zhuang Zi, relied on comparisons, anecdotes, and allegories. By the 3rd century BC, these writers had developed a simple, concise and economical prose style that served as a model of literary form for over 2,000 years.  They were written in [[Classical Chinese]], the language spoken during the [[Spring and Autumn period]].

[[File:Wenchang.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Wenchang Wang|Wen Chang]], a Chinese deity of literature.]]
During the [[Tang Dynasty|Tang period]], the ornate, artificial style of prose developed in previous periods was replaced by a simple, direct, and forceful prose based on examples from the Hundred Schools (see above) and from the [[Han Dynasty|Han period]], the period in which the great historical works of [[Sima Tan]] and [[Sima Qian]] were published. This neoclassical style dominated prose writing for the next 800 years. It was exemplified in the work of [[Han Yu]] 韓愈 (768–824), a master essayist and strong advocate of a return to [[Confucian]] orthodoxy; Han Yu was later listed as one of the "Eight Great Prose Masters of the Tang and Song."

The [[Song Dynasty]] saw the rise in popularity of "travel record literature" (''youji wenxue''). [[Travel literature]] combined both [[diary]] and [[narrative]] prose formats, it was practiced by such seasoned travelers as [[Fan Chengda]] (1126–1193) and [[Xu Xiake]] (1587–1641) and can be seen in the example of [[Su Shi]]'s ''[[Su Shi#Travel record literature|Record of Stone Bell Mountain]]''.

After the 14th century, [[vernacular]] fiction became popular, at least outside of court circles. Vernacular fiction covered a broader range of subject matter and was longer and more loosely structured than literary fiction. One of the masterpieces of Chinese vernacular fiction is the 18th-century domestic novel ''[[Dream of the Red Chamber]]'' (紅樓夢).

=== Classical fiction and drama ===
Chinese fiction was rooted in the official histories and such less formal works as ''[[Shishuo Xinyu|A New Account of the Tales of the World]]'' and ''[[Sou Shen Ji|Investigations of the Supernatural]]'' (4th and 5th century); ''[[Wenyuan Yinghua|Finest Flowers from the World of Letters]]'' (a 10th-century compilation of works from earlier centuries); ''[[Da Tang Xiyu Ji|Great Tang Record of the Western Regions]]'' completed by the pilgrim to India, [[Xuanzang]] in 646; ''[[Youyang Zazu|Variety Dishes from Youyang]]'', the best known collection of [[Classical Chinese]] ''[[Chuanqi]]'' (Marvelous Tales) from the Tang dynasty; and the ''[[Taiping Guangji]]'', which preserved the corpus of these Tang dynasty tales.  There was a range of less formal works either oral or using oral conventions, such as the [[bianwen]] (Buddhist tale), [[pinghua (storytelling)|pinghua]] (plain tale), and [[huaben]] (novella), which formed background to the [[novel]] as early as the [[Song Dynasty]]. The novel as an extended prose narrative which realistically creates a believable world of its own evolved in China and in Europe from the 14th–18th centuries, though a little earlier in China. Chinese audiences were more interested in history and Chinese authors generally did not present their works as fictional. Readers appreciated relative optimism, moral humanism, relative emphasis on group behavior, and welfare of the society.

With the rise of monetary economy and urbanization beginning in the Song Dynasty, there was a growing professionalization of entertainment fostered by the spread of printing, the rise of literacy and education. In both China and Europe, the novel gradually became more autobiographical and serious in exploration of social, moral, and philosophical problems. Chinese fiction of the late [[Ming dynasty]] and early [[Qing dynasty]] was varied, self-conscious, and experimental. In China, however, there was no counterpart to the 19th-century European explosion of revolution and romanticism.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Ropp, “The Distinctive Art of Chinese Fiction,” in Paul S. Ropp, ed., The Heritage of China: Contemporary Perspectives on Chinese Civilization.  (Berkeley; Oxford:: University of California Press, 1990). pp. 309–334.&lt;/ref&gt; The novels of the Ming and early Qing dynasties, represented a pinnacle of classical Chinese fiction.

== Modern literature ==

=== Late Qing (1895–1911) ===
Scholars now tend to agree that modern Chinese literature did not erupt suddenly in the [[New Culture Movement]] (1917–23). Instead, they trace its origins back at least to the late Qing period (1895–1911). The late Qing was a period of intellectual ferment sparked by a sense of national crisis. Intellectuals began to seek solutions to China's problems outside of its own tradition. They translated works of Western expository writing and literature, which enthralled readers with new ideas and opened up windows onto new exotic cultures. Most outstanding were the translations of [[Yan Fu]] (嚴復) (1864–1921) and [[Lin Shu]] (林紓) (1852–1924). In this climate, a boom in the writing of fiction occurred, especially after the 1905 abolition of the civil service examination when literati struggled to fill new social and cultural roles for themselves. Stylistically, this fiction shows signs of both the Chinese novelistic tradition and Western narrative modes. In subject matter, it is strikingly concerned with the contemporary: social problems, historical upheaval, changing ethical values, etc. In this sense, late Qing fiction is modern. Important novelists of the period include [[Wu Woyao]] (吳沃堯) (1866–1910), [[Li Boyuan]] (李伯元) (1867–1906), [[Liu E]] (劉鶚) (1857–1909), and [[Zeng Pu]] (曾樸) (1872–1935).

The late Qing also saw a "revolution in poetry" (詩界革命), which promoted experimentation with new forms and the incorporation of new registers of language. However, the poetry scene was still dominated by the adherents to the Tongguang School (named after the [[Tongzhi Emperor|Tongzhi]] and [[Guangxu Emperor|Guangxu]] reigns of the Qing), whose leaders—[[Chen Yan (poet)|Chen Yan]] (陳衍), [[Chen Sanli]] (陳三立), [[Zheng Xiaoxu]] (鄭孝胥), and [[Shen Zengzhi]] (沈曾植)—promoted a Song style in the manner of Huang Tingjian. These poets would become the objects of scorn by New Culturalists like [[Hu Shi]], who saw their work as overly allusive, artificial, and divorced from contemporary reality.

In drama, the late Qing saw the emergence of the new "civilized drama" (文明戲), a hybrid of Chinese operatic drama with Western-style spoken drama. [[Peking opera]] and "reformed Peking opera" were also popular at the time.

=== Republican Era (1912–49) ===
{{refimprove section|date=September 2016}}
The literary scene in the first few years before the collapse of the Qing in 1911 was dominated by popular love stories, some written in the classical language and some in the vernacular. This entertainment fiction would later be labeled "[[Mandarin Ducks and Butterflies]]" fiction by New Culturalists, who despised its lack of social engagement. Throughout much of the Republican era, Butterfly fiction would reach many more readers than its "progressive" counterpart.

In the course of the [[New Culture Movement]] (1917–23), the vernacular language largely displaced the classical in all areas of literature and writing. Literary reformers [[Hu Shih]] (1891–1962) and [[Chen Duxiu]] (1880–1942) declared the classical language "dead" and promoted the vibrant vernacular in its stead. Hu Shi once said, "A dead language can never produce a living literature." {{sfnb|deBary|2000| p = 362}} In terms of literary practice, [[Lu Xun]] (1881–1936) is usually said to be the first major stylist in the new vernacular prose that Hu Shi and Chen Duxiu were promoting.

Though often said to be less successful than their counterparts in fiction writing, poets also experimented with the vernacular in new poetic forms, such as free verse and the sonnet. Given that there was no tradition of writing poetry in the vernacular, these experiments were more radical than those in fiction writing and also less easily accepted by the reading public. Modern poetry flourished especially in the 1930s, in the hands of poets like [[Zhu Xiang]] (朱湘), [[Dai Wangshu]], [[Li Jinfa]] (李金發), [[Wen Yiduo]] , and [[Ge Xiao]] (葛蕭). Other poets, even those among the [[May Fourth Movement|May Fourth]] radicals (e.g., [[Yu Dafu]]), continued to write poetry in classical styles.

May Fourth radicalism, combined with changes in the education system, made possible the emergence of a large group of women writers. While there had been [[Women in ancient and imperial China#Qing dynasty|women writers]] in the late imperial period and the late Qing, they had been few in number. These writers generally tackled domestic issues, such as relations between the sexes, family, and friendship, but they were revolutionary in giving direct expression to female subjectivity. [[Ding Ling]]'s story ''[[Miss Sophia's Diary]]'' exposes the thoughts and feelings of its female diarist in all their complexity.

The 1920s and 1930s saw the emergence of spoken drama. Most outstanding among playwrights of the day are [[Ouyang Yuqian]], [[Hong Shen]], [[Tian Han]], and [[Cao Yu (playwright)|Cao Yu]].{{sfn|Chen|2014|p=5}} More popular than this Western-style drama, however, was Peking opera, raised to new artistic heights by the likes of [[Mei Lanfang]].

In the late 1920s and 1930s, literary journals and societies espousing various artistic theories proliferated. Among the major writers of the period were [[Guo Moruo]] (1892–1978), a poet, historian, essayist, and critic; [[Mao Dun]] (1896–1981), the first of the novelists to emerge from the [[League of Left-Wing Writers]] and one whose work reflected the revolutionary struggle and disillusionment of the late 1920s; satirist and novelist [[Lao She]] (1899–1966); and [[Ba Jin]] (1904–2005), a novelist whose work was influenced by [[Ivan Turgenev]] and other Russian writers. In the 1930s Ba Jin produced a trilogy that depicted the struggle of modern youth against the ageold dominance of the Confucian family system. Comparison often is made between ''[[Family (Ba Jin novel)|Jia]]'' (Family), one of the novels in the trilogy, and ''[[Dream of the Red Chamber]]''. Many of these writers became important as administrators of artistic and literary policy after 1949. Most of those authors who were still alive during the [[Cultural Revolution]] (1966–76) were either purged or forced to submit to public humiliation.

The [[League of Left-Wing Writers]] founded in 1930 included [[Lu Xun]] among its leadership. By 1932 it had adopted the Soviet doctrine of [[socialist realism]]; that is, the insistence that art must concentrate on contemporary events in a realistic way, exposing the ills of nonsocialist society and promoting a glorious future under [[communism]].&lt;ref name="CAM"&gt;Leo Oufan Lee,  "Literary Trends: The Road to Revolution 1927–1949," Ch 9 in {{cite book | last1=Fairbank | first1=John King | last2=Feuerwerker | first2=Albert | last3=Twitchett | first3=Denis Crispin| title= The Cambridge history of China | publisher=Cambridge University Press | location=Cambridge, England | year=1986 | isbn=978-0-521-24338-4}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=Fxs3ROaIhPMC&amp;pg=PA428 link to excerpt]&lt;/ref&gt;

Other styles of literature were at odds with the highly-political literature being promoted by the League. The "[[New Sensationists]]" (新感覺派)—a group of writers based in [[Shanghai]] who were influenced, to varying degrees, by Western and Japanese modernism—wrote fiction that was more concerned with the unconscious and with aesthetics than with politics or social problems. Most important among these writers were [[Mu Shiying]], [[Liu Na'ou]] (劉吶鷗), and [[Shi Zhecun]].{{By whom|date=July 2010}} Other writers, including [[Shen Congwen]] and [[Fei Ming]] (廢名), balked at the utilitarian role for literature by writing lyrical, almost nostalgic, depictions of the countryside. [[Lin Yutang]], who had studied at Harvard and Leipzig, introduced the concept of ''youmo'' (humor), which he used in trenchant criticism of China's political and cultural situation before leaving for the United States.

The [[Communist Party of China]] had established a base after the [[Long March]] in [[Yan'an]]. The literary ideals of the League were being simplified and enforced on writers and "cultural workers". In 1942, [[Mao Zedong]] gave a series of lectures called "[[Yan'an Forum|Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Art and Literature]]" that clearly made literature subservient to politics via the [[Yan'an Rectification Movement]]. This document would become the national guideline for culture after the establishment of the People's Republic of China.

=== Maoist Era (1949–76) ===
After coming to power in 1949, the Communists gradually nationalized the publishing industry, centralized the book distribution system, and brought writers under institutional control through the Writers Union. A system of strict censorship was implemented, with Mao's "Yan'an Talks" as the guiding force. Periodic literary campaigns targeted figures such as [[Hu Shi]] and other figures from the New Culture period, especially [[Hu Feng]], a protege of Lu Xun who, along with his wife [[Mei Zhi]], did not toe the Party line on literature.&lt;ref name=sina&gt;{{cite web | url=http://news.sina.com.cn/s/2008-03-12/113615131996.shtml | title=張曉風：我的父親母親 | trans-title=Zhang Xiaofeng: My father and mother | language=Chinese | last1=Zhang 張 | first1=Xiaofeng 曉風 | website=Sina | date=12 March 2008 | access-date=3 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Socialist realism became the uniform style, and many Soviet works were translated. The ability to satirize and expose the evils in contemporary society that had made writers useful to the [[Communist Party of China]] before its accession to power was no longer welcomed. Party cultural leaders such as [[Zhou Yang (literary theorist)|Zhou Yang]] used Mao's call to have literature "serve the people" to mount attacks on "[[petty bourgeois]] idealism" and "[[humanitarianism]]". This conflict came to a head in the [[Hundred Flowers Campaign]] (1956–57). Mao Zedong initially encouraged writers to speak out against problems in the new society. Having learned the lessons of the anti-Hu Feng campaign, they were reluctant, but then a flurry of newspaper articles, films, and literary works drew attention to such problems as bureaucratism and authoritarianism within the ranks of the party. Shocked at the level of discontent, Mao's [[Anti-Rightist Movement]] put large numbers of intellectuals through so-called "thought reform" or sent them to labor camps. At the time of the [[Great Leap Forward]] (1957–59), the government increased its insistence on the use of socialist realism and combined with it so-called revolutionary realism and revolutionary romanticism.

Despite the literary control and strictures to limit subjects to contemporary China and the glories of the revolution, writers produced widely read novels of energy and commitment. Examples of this new socialist literature include ''The Builder'' (Chuangye Shi 創業史) by Liu Qing 柳青, ''The Song of Youth'' (Qing Chun Zhi Ge 青春之歌) by [[Yang Mo]], ''Tracks in the Snowy Forest'' (Lin Hai Xue Yuan 林海雪原) by [[Qu Bo (writer)|Qu Bo]], ''Keep the Red Flag Flying'' (Hong Qi Pu 紅旗譜) by Liang Bin 梁斌, ''The Red Sun'' (Hong Ri 紅日) by Wu Qiang 吳強, and ''[[Red Crag]]'' by Luo Guangbin 羅廣斌 and Yang Yiyan (楊益言).

During the [[Cultural Revolution]] (1966–1976), Mao's wife, [[Jiang Qing]] led the campaign against "feudal" and "bourgeois" culture. The only stage productions allowed were her "[[Revolutionary opera|Eight Model Operas]]," which combined traditional and western forms, while great fanfare was given to politically orthodox films and heroic novels, such as those by [[Hao Ran]] (浩然).&lt;ref&gt;Paul Clark. ''The Chinese Cultural Revolution: A History.'' (Cambridge University Press, 2008; {{ISBN|9780521875158}}).&lt;/ref&gt; The period has long been regarded as a cultural wasteland, but some now suggest that the leading works have an energy which is still of interest.&lt;ref&gt;Barbara Mittler. ''A Continuous Revolution: Making Sense of Cultural Revolution Culture.'' (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Asia Center, Harvard East Asian Monographs,  2012).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Opening and reform (1978–1989) ===
The arrest of [[Jiang Qing]] and the other members of the [[Gang of Four]] in 1976, and especially the reforms initiated at the [[11th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China|Third Plenum of the Eleventh National Party Congress Central Committee]] in December 1978, led writers to take up their pens again. Much of the literature in what would be called the "new era" (新時期) discussed the serious abuses of power that had taken place at both the national and the local levels during the [[Cultural Revolution]]. The writers decried the waste of time and talent during that decade and bemoaned abuses that had held China back. This literature, often called "[[scar literature]]", or "the literature of the wounded", discussed the experiences of [[sent-down youth]] with great though not complete frankness and conveyed disquieting views of the party and the political system. Intensely patriotic, these authors wrote cynically of the political leadership that gave rise to the extreme chaos and disorder of the Cultural Revolution. Many of these themes and attitudes were also found in [[Cinema of China#Rise of the Fifth Generation|Fifth Generation films]] of directors trained after 1978, many of which were based on published novels and short stories. Some of this fiction and cinema extended the blame to the entire generation of leaders and to the political system itself. The political authorities were faced with a serious problem: how could they encourage writers to criticize and discredit the abuses of the Cultural Revolution without allowing that criticism to go beyond what they considered tolerable limits?

During this period, the number of literary magazines rose sharply, and many from before the Cultural Revolution were revived.  Poetry also changed in its form and content. Four "[[misty poets]]", [[Bei Dao]], [[Gu Cheng]], [[Duo Duo]] and [[Yang Lian (poet)|Yang Lian]] expressed themselves in deliberately obscure verse which reflected subjective realism rather than the realism of the sort promoted during the Cultural Revolution. There was a special interest in foreign works. Recent foreign literature was translated, often without carefully considering its interest for the Chinese reader. Literary magazines specializing in translations of foreign short stories became very popular, especially among the young.

Some leaders in the government, literary and art circles feared change was happening too fast. The first reaction came in 1980 with calls to combat "bourgeois liberalism," a campaign that was repeated in 1981. These two difficult periods were followed by the [[Anti-Spiritual Pollution Campaign]] in late 1983.

At the same time, writers remained freer to write in unconventional styles and to treat sensitive subject matter. A spirit of literary experimentation flourished in the second half of the 1980s. Fiction writers such as [[Wang Meng (author)|Wang Meng]] (王蒙), [[Zhang Xinxin (writer)|Zhang Xinxin]] (張辛欣), and [[Zong Pu]] (宗璞) and dramatists such as [[Gao Xingjian]] (高行健) experimented with modernist language and narrative modes. Another group of writers—collectively said to constitute the Roots (尋根) movement—including [[Han Shaogong]] (韓少功), [[Mo Yan]], [[Ah Cheng]] (阿城), and [[Jia Pingwa]] (賈平凹) sought to reconnect literature and culture to [[Culture of China|Chinese traditions]], from which a century of modernization and cultural and political [[iconoclasm]] had severed them. Other writers (e.g., [[Yu Hua]] (余華), [[Ge Fei (author)|Ge Fei]] (格非), [[Su Tong]] (蘇童) experimented in a more avant-garde (先鋒) mode of writing that was daring in form and language and showed a complete loss of faith in ideals of any sort.{{By whom|date=July 2010}}

=== Post-Tiananmen (1989–present) ===

In the wake of the [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989|Tiananmen massacre of 1989]] and with the intensification of market reforms, literature and culture turned increasingly commercial and escapist. [[Wang Shuo]] (王朔), the so-called "hooligan" (痞子) writer, is the most obvious manifestation of this commercial shift, though his fiction is not without serious intent.{{By whom|date=July 2010}} Some writers, such as [[Yan Lianke]] 閻連科, continue to take seriously the role of literature in exposing social problems; his novel ''Dreams of Ding Village'' (丁莊夢) deals with the plight of [[HIV]]-[[AIDS]] victims. As in the May Fourth Movement, women writers came to the fore. Many of them, such as [[Chen Ran]] (陳然), [[Wei Hui]] (衛慧), [[Wang Anyi]] (王安憶), and [[Hong Ying]] (虹影), explore female subjectivity in a radically changing society. Neo-realism is another important current in post-Tiananmen fiction, for instance in the writings of [[Liu Heng (writer)|Liu Heng]] (劉恆), [[Chi Li]] (池莉), [[Fang Fang]] (方方), [[He Dun]] (何頓), and [[Zhu Wen (writer)|Zhu Wen]] (朱文)

According to [[Martin Woesler]] trends in contemporary Chinese literature include: 'cult literature' with [[Guo Jingming]] (郭敬明), 悲傷逆流成河 ''Cry me a sad river'', vagabond literature with [[Xu Zechen]] (徐則臣), 跑步穿過中關村 ''Running Through Beijing'',&lt;ref&gt;Translated by Eric Abrahamsen, published by Two Lines Press, 2013. http://twolinespress.com/?project=running-through-beijing-by-xu-zechen&lt;/ref&gt; [[Liu Zhenyun]] (劉震雲), 我叫劉躍 ''The pickpockets'', underground literature [[Mian Mian]] (棉棉), 聲名狼藉 ''Panda Sex'', 'longing for something' literature, divided in historicizing literature with [[Yu Dan (academic)|Yu Dan]] 于丹, 《論語》心得 ''Confucius in your heart'', [[Yi Zhongtian]] (易中天) and in Tibetan literature with [[Alai (author)|Alai]], literature of the mega cities, women's literature with [[Bi Shumin]] (畢淑敏), 女兒拳 ''Women’s boxing'', 女心理師 ''The female psychologist'', master narratives by narrators like [[Mo Yan]] 莫言 with 生死疲勞 ''Life and Death are Wearing me out''.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Woesler, ''Chinese contemporary literature – authors, works, trends – A snap-shot 2007/2008'', Munich 2008, 267 pp.&lt;/ref&gt; Oblique social criticism is also a popular form, for example [[Han Han]]'s (韓寒) novel 他的國 ''His land'' (2009), which was written in a surreal style opposed to the uncritical mainstream, but ranked 1st in 2009 Chinese bestseller list.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Woesler, ''Chinese cultic literature 2008/2009 – authors, works, trends'', Munich 2009, 127 pp.&lt;/ref&gt; Another example is Yan Ge's novel 我們家 ''Family of Joy'' (2013), which was written in Sichuanese and won the Chinese Media Group New Talent Award in 2013.

Chinese language literature also flourishes in the diaspora—in [[South East Asia]], the [[United States]], and [[Europe]]. China is the largest publisher of books, magazines and newspapers in the world.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}} In book publishing alone, some 128,800 new titles of books were published in 2005, according to the General Administration of Press and Publication. There are more than 600 literary journals across the country. Living in [[France]] but continuing to write primarily in Chinese, [[Gao Xingjian]] became the first Chinese writer to receive the [[Nobel Prize in Literature|Nobel Prize for Literature]] in 2000. In 2012, [[Mo Yan]] also received the Nobel Prize in Literature. In 2015, children's author [[Cao Wenxuan]] was awarded the [[Hans Christian Andersen Award]], the first Chinese author to win the top international children's book prize (although several Chinese authors had previously been nominated).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ibby.org/1568.0.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-11-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161022044619/http://www.ibby.org/1568.0.html |archivedate=2016-10-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Online literature ===

In the new millennium, online literature in China plays a much more important role than in the United States and the rest of the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://internetworldstats.com/stats7.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; Most books are available online, where the most popular novels find millions of readers. They cost an average of 2 CNY, or roughly a tenth of the average price of a printed book.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accu.or.jp/appreb/02/02-02/02-02country/02chi.html Isabel Xiang, “Chinese Popular Author Eyes Profits Online”, in: APPREB (December 2008)]; 彭文波 Peng Wenbo, 赵晓芳 Zhao Xiaofang, “新媒体时代的博客传播与图书出版研究 Blogs and Book Publication in New Media Era”, 《出版科学》 Publishing Journal, 2007年 第15卷 第04期, 期刊 {{ISSN|1009-5853}}(2007)04-0068-04, 2007, issue 4, page 68-70, 84; 2007–04&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michel Hockx, in: Cambridge History of Chinese Literature, 2010; Martin Woesler, in: European Journal of Sinology (2010) 88–97&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Shanda|Shanda Literature Ltd.]] is an online publishing company that claims to publish 8,000 Chinese literary works daily.

=== Book market ===
[[File:VM 4652 Wuchang Chongwen Book City.jpg|thumb|Inside Chongwen Book City, a large bookstore in [[Wuhan]].]]
China buys many foreign book rights; nearly 16 million copies of the sixth book of the [[Harry Potter]] series were sold in Chinese translation.  As ''China Book Review'' reported, the rights to 9,328 foreign titles&amp;nbsp;– including many children's books&amp;nbsp;– went to China in 2007. China was nominated as a ''Guest of Honour'' at the [[Frankfurt Bookfair]] in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.boersenblatt.net/143684/]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.buchmesse.de/en/networking/search_find/book_markets/asia/china/00095/index.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-04-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091014063127/http://www.buchmesse.de/en/networking/search_find/book_markets/asia/china/00095/index.html |archivedate=2009-10-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book market in China traditionally orders books during book fairs, because the country lacks a national book ordering system. In 2006, 6.8 million titles were sold, not including an unknown number of banned titles, bootleg copies and underground publishing factories. Seven percent of all publishers are located in Shanghai. Because the industry lacks a national distribution system, many titles from publishers in the provinces can only be found there.

The central publishing houses belonging to ministries or (other) government institutions have their main seat at Beijing (40 percent of all publishers). Most regional publishing houses are situated in the capitals of the provinces. Universities also have associated presses. Private publishing is tolerated. 220,000 books were published in 2005. Among 579 publishers—almost five times more than thirty years ago—225 are supervised by ministries, commissions or the army; 348 are controlled by agencies; and six are even more independent. On the other hand, 100,000 private bookstores bring in the half of the income of the book industry.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.faz.net/dynamic/buchmesse/Zeitung_zur_Buchmesse-19-10-2008.pdf Zeitung zur Buchmesse,FAZ 19.10.2008, S. 22 (PDF; 12,15 MB)]&lt;/ref&gt;

China's state-run General Administration of Press and Publication (新聞出版總署) screens all Chinese literature intended to be sold on the open market. The GAPP has the legal authority to screen, censor, and ban any print, electronic, or Internet publication in China. Because all publishers in China are required to be licensed by the GAPP, that agency also has the power to deny people the right to publish, and completely shut down any publisher who fails to follow its dictates.&lt;ref name="CECC"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cecc.gov/pages/virtualAcad/exp/expcensors.php |title=General Administration of Press and Publication |accessdate=2008-09-05 |publisher=CECC |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080828204934/http://www.cecc.gov/pages/virtualAcad/exp/expcensors.php |archivedate=2008-08-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the ratio of official to unlicensed books is said to be 2:3.&lt;ref name="ZonaEuropa"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://zonaeuropa.com/20050614_1.htm | title = The Underground Publishing Industry in China | accessdate = 2008-09-05 | publisher= ZoneEuropa}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a report in ZonaEuropa, there are more than 4,000 underground publishing factories around China.&lt;ref name="CECC"/&gt; The Chinese government continues to hold public book burnings&lt;ref name="OYCF"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.oycf.org/Perspectives/8_103100/afterthoughts_on_the_banning_of.htm | title = Afterthoughts on the Banning of "Shanghai Baby" | accessdate = 2008-09-05 | author = Sheng, John | last = | first = |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080420173709/http://www.oycf.org/Perspectives/8_103100/afterthoughts_on_the_banning_of.htm &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2008-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; on unapproved yet popular "spiritual pollution" literature, though critics claim this spotlight on individual titles only helps fuel booksales.&lt;ref name="Amazon.Com"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.amazon.com/Naughty-Spiritual-Pollution-Essential-Reading/lm/R2XEKC3K9JGS1Y | title = Naughty CHINA | accessdate = 2008-09-05 | publisher= Amazon.Com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many new-generation Chinese authors who were the recipients of such government attention have been re-published in English and success in the western literary markets, namely [[Wei Hui]]'s ''[[Shanghai Baby]]'', [[Anchee Min]]'s controversial memoir ''[[Red Azalea]]'', ''[[Time Magazine]]'' banned-book covergirl Chun Sue's ''Beijing Doll'', and [[Mian Mian]]'s ''Candy''. Online bestseller ''[[Ghost Blows Out the Light]]'' had to be rewritten to remove references to the supernatural before it could be released in print.&lt;ref name="wired"&gt;[https://www.wired.com/techbiz/media/news/2007/08/online_novels?currentPage=1 "The Chinese Novel Finds New Life Online"], Aventurina King, ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'', August 17, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Impact of translation on modern and contemporary Chinese writers ===

Translated literature has long played an important role in modern China. Some writers, such as [[Lu Xun]], [[Yu Dafu]], [[Ba Jin]] and others were literary translators themselves, and many present day writers in China, such as the Nobel laureate [[Mo Yan]], listed translated works as sources of enlightenment and inspiration.

== Contemporary Chinese literature in translation ==
Chinese literature is increasingly available in translation- there are now several well-established websites sharing information, for example, [https://paper-republic.org/ Paper Republic], [https://writingchinese.leeds.ac.uk/ Writing Chinese], [http://www.chinese-shortstories.com/ Chinese Short Stories], [http://mychinesebooks.com/?lang=en My Chinese Books], [https://chinesebooksforyoungreaders.wordpress.com/ Chinese Books for Young Readers].
 
In 2005, the Chinese government started a sponsoring program for translations of government-approved Chinese works, which has already resulted in more than 200 books being translated from Chinese into other languages.

[[File:Woodstock redmond crowd.JPG|thumb|Audience at [[Woodstock]], observing concert etiquette that would be inappropriate at most classical music concerts.]]

'''Concert etiquette''' refers to a set of [[social norms]] observed by those attending musical performances. These norms vary depending upon the type of music performance and can be stringent or informal.

==Western classical music==
At [[classical music]] concerts, the cardinal principle is to let others listen to the music undisturbed. Instruments and voices are typically unamplified, and the music is rich in detail and includes passages played very softly. Many audience members want to hear everything, and the normal standard of courtesy is simply to be entirely silent while the music is playing.  Thus, during this time experienced concertgoers avoid conversation, try to suppress coughs and sneezes until a loud passage arrives, and muffle these with handkerchiefs. Electronic devices are turned off. Concertgoers try to arrive and take seats before the music begins; late arrivals wait until a break between pieces allows seating by an usher.

Dress expectations for the audience are today rather informal in English-speaking countries. Audiences usually meet "[[smart casual]]" standards, with some performance companies explicitly telling audiences to wear whatever makes them comfortable.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.national.ballet.ca/education/attending/ National Ballet of Canada.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090501172108/http://www.national.ballet.ca/education/attending/ |date=2009-05-01 }} Accessed 14 March 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.coc.ca/explore/etiquette.html Canadian Opera Company.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706173713/http://www.coc.ca/explore/etiquette.html |date=2011-07-06 }} Accessed 14 March 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Hats are removed as they block others' view of the stage. Dress expectations may still be very formal for special events, events that are difficult to attend, that take place in traditional venues, or that take place in certain countries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.khaleejtimes.com/kt-article-display-1.asp?section=todaysfeatures&amp;xfile=/data/todaysfeatures/2013/July/todaysfeatures_July33.xml Do’s and don’ts of Bayreuth’s Wagner Fest] July 30, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The [[Glyndebourne Festival]] has traditionally encouraged its audiences to dress formally ([[black tie]] for men); [http://www.glyndebourne.com/about-us/faq/].&lt;/ref&gt;

Concert etiquette has, like the music, evolved over time. Late eighteenth-century composers such as [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]] expected that people would talk, particularly at dinner, and took delight in audiences clapping at once in response to a nice musical effect.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Spaethling, ''Mozart's Letters, Mozart's Life'', p. 160.&lt;/ref&gt; Individual movements were encored in response to audience applause.

The nineteenth century brought a shift in venue from aristocratic gatherings to public concerts along with works featuring an unprecedentedly wide dynamic range. [[Gustav Mahler|Mahler]] clamped down on [[claque]]s paid to applaud a particular performer, and specified in the score of his ''[[Kindertotenlieder]]'' that its movements should not be punctuated by applause.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=[[Alex Ross (music critic)|Alex Ross]]|title=''The Rest Is Noise: Applause''|url=http://www.therestisnoise.com/2005/02/applause_a_rest.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Richard Wagner|Wagner]] discouraged what he considered distracting noises from his audience at [[Bayreuth Festspielhaus|Bayreuth]] in 1882.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}

With the arrival of recording technology in the twentieth century, applause between the movements of a symphony or suite came to be regarded as a distraction from the momentum and unity of a work. Today it is usually considered something of a faux pas, though a minor and well-meaning one.&lt;ref&gt;Since applause is delayed to the end of the final movement, audiences sometimes need to guess (usually guided by a printed program) that the movement they are hearing is indeed the last one. Often, final movements give their listeners clear sonic cues to this effect. A a non-final movement that "sounds final" (notably, the third movement of [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky|Tchaikovsky]]'s [[Symphony No. 6 (Tchaikovsky)|Sixth Symphony ''Pathétique'']]) is likely to be applauded against convention.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometimes it is the purpose of the conductor to maintain a fairly long silence after the last notes of a piece; this is an especially likely choice for pieces with quiet endings. The audience can be signaled not to applaud immediately through the device of the conductor keeping her hands lifted (as if still leading the orchestra), then lowering them when the intended silence is over. Thus in a way the conductor is "conducting the audience" as part of a performance ritual. Such efforts are usually heeded, at least by experienced audiences.

Sacred works offered as worship are not applauded. Such works include settings of [[Requiem#History of musical compositions|requiem]], [[Passion (music)|Passion]], [[Mass (music)|mass]], or [[Kaddish]] prayer. Presented in an artistic context, such works, along with secular works of comparable gravity, still often get respectful silence for a long moment before any applause.

In [[opera]] a particularly impressive aria will often be applauded, even if the music is continuing. Shouting is generally acceptable only during applause. The word shouted is often the Italian word ''bravo'' or a variation (''brava'' in the case of a female performer, ''bravi'' for a plural number of performers, ''bravissimo'' for a truly exceptional performance). The word's original meaning is  "skillful" and it has come to mean "well done". The French word ''[[Encore (concert)|encore]]'' ("again") may be shouted as a request for more, although in France itself ''bis'' ("twice") is the more usual expression. In some cultures (e.g., Britain) enthusiastic approval can also be expressed by whistling, though in others (e.g., Italy, Russia) whistling can signify disapproval and act as the equivalent of booing.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}

Collapses of decorum have occurred often in music history. In 1861 a Paris performance of [[Richard Wagner]]'s opera ''[[Tannhäuser (opera)|Tannhäuser]]'' was deliberately sabotaged by audience members bringing [[claque|noisemakers]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wagneropera.net/Operas/Intro-Tannhauser.htm Tannhäuser (Tannhäuser und der Sängerkrieg auf Wartburg)]&lt;/ref&gt; The premiere of [[Igor Stravinsky|Stravinsky]]'s ballet ''[[The Rite of Spring]]'' in 1913 prompted catcalls and whistles from the crowd that degenerated into fistfights in the aisles and police intervention. [[Steve Reich]]'s ''[[Four Organs]]'' at [[Carnegie Hall]] in 1973 featured audience members sarcastically applauding and shouting to hasten the end of the performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.classicalarchives.com/work/199350.html#tvf=tracks&amp;tv=about|author=[[Steve Reich]]|title=4 Organs, for 4 electric organs and maracas|publisher=[[Classical Archives]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conductor [[Michael Tilson Thomas]] recalls a woman walking down the aisle and beating her head against the front of the stage, wailing "Stop, stop! I confess!"

==Rock and metal music==
[[Rock music]] and related genres are performed with amplified instruments, often at very loud volume, and tend to be dynamically more uniform than classical music. Thus sounds made by the audience are far less damaging to the musical enjoyment of others and are far more tolerated. At concerts of [[hard rock]], [[Punk rock|punk]] or [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]], a [[mosh pit]] will often form in front of the stage, in which slam-dancing and the like may be performed, usually in an atmosphere of lively camaraderie and mutual assistance. 'Moshers' who have fallen are to be helped up immediately to avoid the risk of trampling, while found pieces of clothing, keys, cell phones, and other such items should be held aloft to be reclaimed. Audience members who are familiar with the lyrics of a given song typically sing along, especially during the chorus of the songs.

Requirements for attire are generally very lax. Blue jeans, shorts, and skirts are common attire, and sandals, sneakers, or boots are standard footwear (conventional high heels are generally unsafe for moshing or at outdoor venues with dirt flooring, though wide-heeled boots may be worn).  Male (and sometimes female) moshers are frequently shirtless, but total nudity is frowned upon. At heavy metal concerts in particular, dark clothing and items such as chains, studded belts and bracelets, and various leather garments are common (this can vary greatly between different styles of metal).{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}

Heavy metal concerts also usually include [[head banging]], mosh pits, fist pumping, [[stage diving]], and [[crowd surfing]]. As many rock and metal concerts are held in standing room only clubs and concert halls, it is sometimes considered an insult to the band to sit during performances, particularly in heavy metal. Even in venues that provide seating, generally the audience will stand for the band's performance.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}

Sometimes at rock concerts, [[lighter]]s are [[:ru:Lighter waving|held in the air]] to signal an encore or a [[Ballad#Power ballads|power ballad]]. With the decline of smokers, the restrictions placed on carrying lighters during air travel, and the increase of [[cell phone]]s in the early 21st century, cell phones (specifically the camera flash) are often used in place of lighters, and as a way to take personal pictures and videos. While this is frowned upon by some fans, cell phone use is fairly commonplace at concerts. Several artists, such as [[Björk]], [[Prince (musician)|Prince]], [[Neutral Milk Hotel]], and [[Jack White]] have begun to specifically request that audience members not use their cell phones during the show. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.digitaltrends.com/photography/7-musicians-who-would-like-you-to-put-away-the-camera-or-else-theyll-do-it-for-you/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Jazz music==
Jazz music is performed in many different settings and venues throughout the world. When jazz is performed in public places such as outdoor jazz festivals and indoor jazz clubs, quiet conversation is usually considered acceptable. When attending a jazz performance in an indoor concert setting, western classical concert etiquette is expected with one exception: it is considered well-mannered to applaud after each artist has completed their extended improvised solo.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}} Other vocalisations during the performance, offered as reactions to improvised phrases, are also acceptable.

{{Life in Egypt}}
The '''culture of Egypt''' has thousands of years of [[recorded history]]. [[Ancient Egypt]] was among the earliest [[civilizations]] in [[Middle East]] and [[Africa]]. For millennia, [[Egypt]] maintained a strikingly unique, complex and stable culture that influenced later cultures of Europe. After the Pharaonic era, Egypt itself came under the influence of Hellenism, for a time Christianity and later, Christian culture.

==Languages==
[[File:Cultural Fashion and Adornment, El Moez St., 00 (70).JPG|thumb|[[Arabic Calligraphy]] has seen its golden age in Cairo. This adornment and beeds being sold in [[Muizz Street]]]]
{{Main|Languages of Egypt}}

[[Arabic language|Arabic]] is Egypt's official language, it came to Egypt in the 7th century, {{sfn|Abdl-Hamid Youssef|2003|p=vii}} and the [[Egyptian Arabic]] dialect today has become the modern speech of the country. Of the many varieties of Arabic, it is the most widely spoken second dialect, due to the influence of [[Egyptian cinema]] and media throughout the Arabic-speaking world. Egypt's position in the heart of the Arab world has also had reversed influence, adopting many words, phrases, and proverbs from neighboring Arabic speaking areas such as the [[Maghreb]] area and the [[Mashriq]]. Today the daily Egyptian Arabic adopted several French, Italian, Greek, Turkish, Armenian and English words to its dictionary, as well as keeping several other words from its own ancient languages such as Coptic and Demotic.

[[Image:Sarcophage Ankhnesneferibre.jpg|thumb|[[hieroglyph]]s, as this examplnoe from a sarcophagus from [[Thebes, Egypt|Thebes]] of about 530 BC, represent both [[ideogram]]s and phonograms.]]

The [[Egyptian language]], which formed a separate branch among the family of [[Afro-Asiatic languages]], was among the first written languages and is known from the [[Egyptian hieroglyph|hieroglyphic]] inscriptions preserved on monuments and sheets of [[papyrus]]. The [[Coptic language]], the most recent stage of Egyptian, is today the [[liturgical language]] of the [[Coptic Orthodox Church]].

The "Koiné" dialect of the [[Greek language]] was important in Hellenistic Alexandria, and was used in the philosophy and science of that culture, and was later studied by Arabic scholars.

In the lower Nile Valley, around [[Kom Ombo]] and [[Aswan]], there are about 300,000 speakers of [[Nubian languages]], mainly [[Nobiin language|Nobiin]], but also Kenuzi-Dongola. The [[Berber languages]] are represented by [[Siwi language|Siwi]], spoken by about 20,000 around the [[Siwa Oasis]]. Other minorities include roughly 60,000 [[Greek language|Greek]] speakers in [[Alexandria]] and [[Cairo]] as well as roughly 10,000 [[Armenian language|Armenian]] speakers.🇪🇬🇪🇬

==Literature==
{{Main|Literature of Egypt}}
[[Image:Egypt bookofthedead.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Sample of a Book of the Dead of the [[scribe]] Nebqed, c. 1300 BC.]]
Many Egyptians believed that when it came to a death of their Pharaoh, they would have to bury the Pharaoh deep inside the Pyramid.
The ancient Egyptian literature dates back to the [[Old Kingdom]], in the third millennium BC. Religious literature is best known for its [[hymns]] to and its mortuary texts. The oldest extant Egyptian literature is the [[Pyramid Texts]]: the mythology and rituals carved around the tombs of rulers. The later, secular literature of ancient Egypt includes the 'wisdom texts', forms of philosophical instruction. The ''Instruction of Ptahhotep'', for example, is a collation of moral proverbs by an Egto (the middle of the second millennium BC) seem to have been drawn from an elite administrative class, and were celebrated and revered into the [[New Kingdom]] (to the end of the second millennium). In time, the Pyramid Texts became [[Coffin Texts]] (perhaps after the end of the Old Kingdom), and finally, the mortuary literature produced its masterpiece, the [[Book of the Dead]], during the New Kingdom.

The [[Middle Kingdom of Egypt|Middle Kingdom]] was the golden age of Egyptian literature. Some notable texts include the Tale of Neferty, the Instructions of [[Amenemhat I]], the [[The Story of Sinuhe|Tale of Sinuhe]], the Story of the Shipwrecked Sailor and the Story of the Eloquent Peasant. ''Instructions'' became a popular literary genre of the [[New Kingdom]], taking the form of advice on proper behavior. The [[Story of Wenamun]] and the [[Instruction of Any]] are well-known examples from this period.

During the [[Greco-Roman|Greco-Roman period]] (332 BC − AD 639), Egyptian literature was translated into other languages, and Greco-Roman literature fused with native art into a new style of writing. From this period comes the [[Rosetta Stone]], which became the key to unlocking the mysteries of Egyptian writing to modern scholarship. The great city of [[Alexandria]] boasted its famous [[Library of Alexandria|Library]] of almost half a million handwritten books during the third century BC. Alexandria's center of learning also produced the Greek translation of the [[Hebrew Bible]], the [[Septuagint]].

During the first few centuries of the Christian era, Egypt was the ultimate source of a great deal of ascetic literature in the [[Coptic language]]. Egyptian monasteries translated many [[Greek language|Greek]] and [[Syriac language|Syriac]] words, which are now only extant in Coptic. Under [[Islam]], Egypt continued to be a great source of literary endeavor, now in the [[Arabic language]]. In 970, [[al-Azhar University]] was founded in [[Cairo]], which to this day remains the most important center of [[Sunni Islamic]] learning. In 12th-century Egypt, the Jewish Talmudic scholar [[Maimonides]] produced his most important work.

In contemporary times, Egyptian novelists and poets were among the last to experiment with modern styles of Arabic-language literature, and the forms they developed have been widely imitated. The first modern Egyptian novel '''''[[Zaynab (novel)|Zaynab]]''''' by [[Muhammad Husayn Haykal]] was published in 1913 in the [[Egyptian Arabic|Egyptian vernacular]]. Egyptian novelist [[Naguib Mahfouz]] was the first Arabic-language writer to win the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]]. Many Egyptian books and films are available throughout the [[Middle East]]. Other prominent Egyptian writers include [[Nawal El Saadawi]], well known for her [[feminism|feminist]] works and [[activism]], and [[Alifa Rifaat]] who also writes about women and tradition. Vernacular poetry is said to be the most popular literary genre amongst [[Egyptians]], represented most significantly by [[Mahmud Bayram el-Tunsi|Bayram el-Tunsi]], [[Ahmed Fouad Negm]] (Fagumi), [[Salah Jaheen]] and [[Abdel Rahman el-Abnudi]].

About 75% of Egypt's population is [[Muslim]], with a Sunni majority. About 22% of the population is [[Coptic Christian]]; other religions and other forms of [[Christianity]] comprise the remaining three percent.
[[Sunni Islam]] sees Egypt as an important part of its religion due to not only Quranic verses mentioning the country, but also due to the Al-Azhar University, one of the earliest of the world universities, and the longest functioning. It was created as a school for religion studies and works.

==Visual art&lt;!--'Egyptian painting' and 'Egyptian paintings' redirect here--&gt;==

===Egyptian art in antiquity===
{{Main|Art of ancient Egypt|Ancient Egyptian architecture}}
{{See also|Contemporary art in Egypt|Egyptian influence in architecture and visual arts}}

The great old Egyptians were one of the first major civilizations to codify design elements in [[art]]. They used art for communication. The [[wall painting]] done in the service of the [[Pharaohs]] followed a rigid code of visual rules and meanings. Early Egyptian art is characterized by the absence of [[linear perspective]], which results in a seemingly flat space. These artists tended to create images based on what they knew, and not as much on what they saw. Objects in these artworks generally do not decrease in size as they increase in distance and there is little shading to indicate [[Distance|depth]]. Sometimes, distance is indicated through the use of ''tiered space'', where more distant objects are drawn higher above the nearby objects, but in the same scale and with no overlapping of forms. People and objects are almost always drawn in profile. Also, you may notice the people in Egyptian art are never facing forward. Archaeologists are not yet sure of why, but they are leaning towards the fact that artists status was low in the hierarchy so they could never be in front of a higher authority figure, and never be faced towards them.

Painting achieved its greats height in [[New Kingdom of Egypt|Dynasty XVII]] during the reigns of Tuthmose IV and [[Amenhotep III]]. The Fragmentary panel of the Lady Thepu, on the right, dates from the time of the latter king.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bothmer|first1=Bernard|title=Brief Guide to the Department of Egyptian and Classical Art|date=1974|publisher=Brooklyn Museum|location=Brooklyn, NH|page=48|accessdate=10 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early Egyptian artists did have a system for maintaining dimensions within artwork. They used a grid system that allowed them to create a smaller version of the artwork, and then scale up the design based upon proportional representation in a larger grid.

===Egyptian art in modern times===
{{Main|Contemporary Art in Egypt}}
[[Modern art|Modern]] and [[Contemporary art|contemporary]] Egyptian art can be as diverse as any works in the world art scene. Some well-known names include [[Mahmoud Mokhtar]], [[Abdel Hadi Al Gazzar]], [[Farouk Hosny]], [[Gazbia Sirry]], [[Kamal Amin]], [[Hussein El Gebaly]], [[Sawsan Amer]] and many others. Many artists in Egypt have taken on modern media such as digital art and this has been the theme of many exhibitions in [[Cairo]] in recent times. There has also been a tendency to use the World Wide Web as an alternative outlet for artists and there is a strong Art-focused internet community on groups that have found origin in Egypt.

==Science==
Egypt's cultural contributions have included great works of [[science]], [[art]], and [[mathematics]], dating from [[Ancient history|antiquity]] to modern times.

===Technology===

===Imhotep===

{{Main|Imhotep}}

Considered to be the first engineer, architect and physician in history known by name, [[Imhotep]] designed the [[Pyramid of Djoser]] (the [[Step Pyramid]]) at [[Saqqara]] in [[History of ancient Egypt|Egypt]] around [[27th century BC|2630]]-[[27th century BC|2611 BC]], and may have been responsible for the first known use of [[columns]] in [[architecture]]. The Egyptian historian [[Manetho]] credited him with inventing stone-dressed building during Djoser's reign, though he was not the first to actually build with stone. Imhotep is also believed to have founded [[Ancient Egyptian medicine|Egyptian medicine]], being the author of the world's earliest known medical document, the [[Edwin Smith Papyrus]].

===Ptolemaic and Roman Egypt===
[[Image:Alexandria Library Inscription.jpg|thumb|200px|Inscription referring to the Alexandrian library, dated AD 56]]

The silk road led straight through ancient Alexandria. Also, the [[Library of Alexandria|Royal Library of Alexandria]] was once the largest in the world. It is usually assumed to have been founded at the beginning of the 3rd century BC during the reign of [[Ptolemy II of Egypt]] after his father had set up the [[Temple of the Muses]] or [[Museum]]. The initial organization is attributed to [[Demetrius Phalereus]]. The Library is estimated to have stored at its peak 400,000 to 700,000 [[Scroll (parchment)|scrolls]].

One of the reasons so little is known about the Library is that it was lost centuries after its creation. All that is left of many of the volumes are tantalizing titles that hint at all the history lost due to the building's destruction. Few events in ancient history are as controversial as the destruction of the Library, as the historical record is both contradictory and incomplete. Its destruction has been attributed by some authors to, among others, [[Julius Caesar]], [[Augustus Caesar]], and Catholic zealots during the purge of the Arian heresy, Not surprisingly, the Great Library became a symbol of knowledge itself, and its destruction was attributed to those who were portrayed as ignorant [[barbarians]], often for purely political reasons.

A [[Bibliotheca Alexandrina|new library]] was inaugurated in 2003 near the site of the old library.

The [[Lighthouse of Alexandria]], one of the [[Seven Wonders of the Ancient World]], designed by [[Sostratus of Cnidus]] and built during the reign of [[Ptolemy I Soter]] served as the city's landmark, and later, lighthouse.

====Mathematics and technology====
{{See also|Greek mathematics}}

[[Alexandria]], being the center of the Hellenistic world, produced a number of great mathematicians, astronomers, and scientists such as [[Ctesibius]], [[Pappus of Alexandria|Pappus]], and [[Diophantus]]. It also attracted scholars from all over the Mediterranean 0 as [[Eratosthenes]] of [[Cyrene, Libya|Cyrene]].

====Ptolemy====
{{Main|Ptolemy}}

[[Ptolemy]] is one of the most famous astronomers and geographers from Egypt, famous for his work in [[Alexandria]]. Born Claudius Ptolemaeus (Greek: Κλαύδιος Πτολεμαίος; c. 85 &amp;ndash; c. 165) in [[Upper Egypt]], he was a [[geographer]], [[astronomer]], and [[astrologer]].&lt;ref&gt;Martin Bernal (1992). "Animadversions on the Origins of Western Science", ''Isis'' '''83''' (4), p. 596-607 [602, 606]&lt;/ref&gt;
			
Ptolemy was the author of two important scientific treatises. One is the astronomical treatise that is now known as the ''[[Almagest]]'' (in Greek ''Η μεγάλη Σύνταξις'', "The Great Treatise"). In this work, one of the most influential books of antiquity, Ptolemy compiled the astronomical knowledge of the ancient Greek and [[Babylonia]]n world. Ptolemy's other main work is his ''Geography''. This too is a compilation, of what was known about the world's [[geography]] in the Roman Empire in his time.

In his ''[[Optics]]'', a work which survives only in an Arabic translation, he writes about properties of [[light]], including [[Reflection (physics)|reflection]], [[refraction]] and [[colour]]. His other works include ''Planetary Hypothesis'', ''Planisphaerium'' and ''Analemma''. Ptolemy's treatise on astrology, the ''[[Tetrabiblos]]'', was the most popular [[astrological]] work of antiquity and also enjoyed great influence in the [[Islamic]] world and the [[medieval]] [[Latin]] [[Western world|West]].

Ptolemy also wrote influential work Harmonics on music theory. After criticizing the approaches of his predecessors, Ptolemy argued for basing musical intervals on mathematical ratios (in contrast to the followers of Aristoxenus) backed up by empirical observation (in contrast to the over-theoretical approach of the Pythagoreans). He presented his own divisions of the tetrachord and the octave, which he derived with the help of a monochord. Ptolemy's astronomical interests also appeared in a discussion of the music of the spheres.

Tributes to Ptolemy include Ptolemaeus crater on the Moon and Ptolemaeus crater on Mars.

====Ahmed Zewail====
{{Main|Ahmed Zewail}}
[[Ahmed Zewail]] ({{lang-ar|أحمد زويل}}) (born February 26, 1946) is an [[Egypt]]ian [[chemistry|chemist]], and the winner of the 1999 [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]] for his work on [[femtochemistry]]. Born in [[Damanhur]] (60&amp;nbsp;km south-east of [[Alexandria]]) and raised in [[Disuq]], he moved to the [[United States]] to complete his PhD at the [[University of Pennsylvania]]. He was awarded a faculty appointment at [[Caltech]] in 1976, where he has remained since.

Zewail's key work has been as the pioneer of [[femtochemistry]]. He developed a method using a rapid [[laser]] technique (consisting of [[ultrashort pulse|ultrashort]] laser flashes), which allows the description of reactions at the [[atom]]ic level. It can be viewed as a highly sophisticated form of [[Flash (photo)|flash photography]].

In 1999, Zewail became the third Egyptian to receive the [[Nobel Prize]], following [[Anwar Sadat]] (1978 in Peace) and [[Naguib Mahfouz]] (1988 in Literature). In 1999, he received Egypt's highest state honor, the [[Grand Collar of the Nile]].

====Egyptology====
{{Main|Egyptology}}

In modern times, [[archaeology]] and the study of Egypt's ancient heritage as the field of [[Egyptology]] has become a major scientific pursuit in the country itself. The field began during the [[Middle Ages]], and has been led by Europeans and Westerners in modern times. The study of Egyptology, however, has in recent decades been taken up by Egyptian archæologists such as [[Zahi Hawass]] and the [[Supreme Council of Antiquities]] he leads.

The discovery of the [[Rosetta Stone]], a tablet written in ancient Greek, Egyptian [[Demotic (Egyptian)|Demotic]] script, and Egyptian hieroglyphs, has partially been credited for the recent stir in the study of Ancient Egypt. [[Greek language|Greek]], a well-known language, gave linguists the ability to decipher the mysterious Egyptian hieroglyphic language. The ability to decipher hieroglyphics facilitated the translation of hundreds of the texts and inscriptions that were previously indecipherable, giving insight into Egyptian culture that would have otherwise been lost to the ages. The stone was discovered on July 15, 1799 in the port town of Rosetta [[Rosetta]], Egypt, and has been held in the [[British Museum]] since 1802.

====Sport====
{{See also|Football in Egypt|Squash in Egypt}}
[[File:Cairo International Stadium.jpg|thumb|right|[[Cairo International Stadium]]]]

[[Association football|Football]] is the most popular sport in Egypt. Egyptian football clubs especially [[El Ahly]] and [[El Zamalek]] are known throughout the continent of Africa and enjoy the reputation of long-time champions of the sport regionally. They enjoy popularity even among non-Egyptians.

The [[Egypt national football team|Egyptian national football team]] won the [[African Cup of Nations]] seven times setting a new record in Africa (years: 57, 59, 86, 98, 06, 08, 10). Egypt was the first African country to join [[FIFA]], but it has only made it to the [[FIFA World Cup]] 3 times, in 1934, 1990 and 2018. In the [[World Military Cup]], Egypt won the title 5 times and was the runner-up another 2 times.

Other popular sports in Egypt are [[basketball]], [[Team handball|handball]], [[Squash (sport)|squash]], and [[tennis]]. The [[Egyptian national basketball team]] holds the record for best performance at the [[FIBA Basketball World Cup|Basketball World Cup]] and at the [[Basketball at the Summer Olympics|Summer Olympics]] in Middle East and Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://archive.fiba.com/pages/eng/fa/event/p/cid//sid/2902/_/1950_FIBA_World_Championship_for_Men/index.html | title=1950 World Championship for Men | publisher=FIBA | date= 9 June 2012 | accessdate=9 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://archive.fiba.com/pages/eng/fa/team/p/sid/2933/tid/276/_/1952_Olympic_Games_Tournament_for_Men/index.html | title=Egypt – 1952 Olympic Games; Tournament for Men | publisher=FIBA | date= 9 June 2012 | accessdate=9 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the team has won a record number of 16 medals at the [[FIBA Africa Championship|African Championship]]. The Egyptian national squash team is always known for its fierce competition in worldwide championships, from the 1930s to today. Handball has become another increasingly popular sport among Egyptians as well. Since the early 1990s, the [[Egypt national handball team|Egyptian national handball team]] has become a growing international force in the sport, winning regional and continental tournaments as well as reaching up to fourth place internationally in 2001. The Junior national handball team reached the first rank in 1993 under the lead of Captain Gamal Shams, and it hosted the tournament in 2010 setting a record in the audience number specially the match between Egypt and Denmark in the semifinals, the stadium was completely full.

In older times (1930s and 40s), Egypt was a powerhouse in [[Olympic weightlifting|weightlifting]], [[boxing]], and [[wrestling]] with several Olympic and world championship medals.

Also, [[roller hockey]] (''quad'') is available in Egypt, but the teams that are playing this game may not exceed 10 teams and the most famous club which plays roller hockey is "Al-Zamalek sporting club", and also "Nasr-City sporting club". The Egyptian national roller hockey team has taken part in many world competitions, but unlikely the team didn't win any tournament.

Local sports clubs receive financial support from the local governments, and many sporting clubs are financially and administratively supported by the government.

==Media==
{{main|Media of Egypt}}

===Cinema===
{{Main|Cinema of Egypt}}

Egyptian cinema has flourished since the 1930s.&lt;ref name="siscie"&gt;[http://www.sis.gov.eg/En/Arts&amp;Culture/Cinema&amp;Drama/CinemaInEgypt/070401000000000001.htm Egyptian State Information Service (SIS) - Cinema In Egypt] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080419121835/http://www.sis.gov.eg/En/Arts%26Culture/Cinema%26Drama/CinemaInEgypt/070401000000000001.htm |date=2008-04-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the Egyptian capital has been dubbed the ''"Hollywood of the Middle East"'', where the world-renowned [[Cairo International Film Festival]] is held every year. The festival has been rated by the [[FIAPF|International Federation of Film Producers Associations]] as being among the 11 top-class film festivals worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ukhotmovies.com/film-festivals/cairo-film-festival/information.html|title=Find out more about the Cairo International Film Festival|author=Film Festivals|work=ukhotmovies.com|accessdate=21 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of Arabic-language TV and [[Egyptian cinema|cinema]] has been notably affected by the [[Egyptian Arabic|Egyptian]] dialect, due to its simplicity.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

The Egyptian film industry is the largest within Arabic-speaking cinema.&lt;ref name="siscie"/&gt;

==Music==
{{Main|Music of Egypt}} 
Egyptian music is a rich mixture of indigenous Egyptian and Western influences.

As early as [[4th millennium BC|4000 BC]], ancient Egyptians were playing [[harps]] and [[flutes]], as well as two indigenous instruments: the [[ney]] and the [[oud]]. However, there is a little notation of Egyptian music before the 7th century AD, when Egypt became part of the [[Muslim world]]. [[Percussion instrument|Percussion]] and [[vocal]] music became important at this time and has remained an important part of Egyptian music today.

Contemporary [[Music of Egypt|Egyptian music]] traces its beginnings to the creative work of luminaries such as Abdu-l Hamuli, Almaz, Sayed Mikkawi, and Mahmud Osman, who were all patronized by [[Isma'il Pasha|Khedive Ismail]] and who influenced the later work of [[Sayed Darwish]], [[Umm Kulthum]], [[Mohammed Abdel Wahab]], [[Abdel Halim Hafez]] and other Egyptian music giants.

From the 1970s onwards, Egyptian [[pop music]] has become increasingly important in Egyptian culture, particularly among the large youth population of Egypt. Egyptian [[folk music]] is also popular, played during weddings and other festivities. In the last quarter of the 20th century, Egyptian music was a way to communicate [[social issue|social]] and [[social class|class]] issues. The most popular Egyptian pop singers are [[Amr Diab]], [[Tamer Hosny]], [[Mohamed Mounir]] and [[Ali El Haggar]]. One of the most respected early [[electronic music]] composers, [[Halim El-Dabh]], is an Egyptian.

[[Belly dance]], or ''Raqs Sharqi'' (literally: oriental dancing) may have originated in Egypt, and today the country is considered the international center of the art.

==Dance==
Egyptian dance tradition dates back to the Pharaonic period. Many paintings and sculptures show Ancient Egyptians dancing.
Throughout the thousands of years of its history, Egypt has developed different types of dance: ancient Egyptian dance, (known in the West as "belly dance"), but also, since the beginning of the 21st century. 
[[File:رقص فلكلور شعبى - رقصه البمبوطية.jpg|thumb|350px|Bamboutiya Dance, originating from the [[Suez Canal]] cities]]

Dance is at the heart of Egyptian society, being used not only as a popular enjoyment (most recently, with the development of the [[mahraganat]] - or [[electro-chaabi]]- music scene), but also serving religious purposes ([[sufi]] dance, [[Zār|zar]], etc ... ). Most of the Egyptian movies use dance and music as a complete part of the narrative frame.

Since the 1970s and the rise of political Islam, "belly dance" and belly-dancers have acquired a bad reputation, but some famous Egyptian dancers stay in the memories as legends: [[Tahia Carioca]], [[Samia Gamal]] who embodied Egypt's golden age ... 
Today the most famous ones are probably [[Fifi Abdo]] and Dina, but in a very more popular - some consider vulgar - way.

Egypt also has an important [[Ballet]] tradition, with [[Cairo Opera House]] hosting a professional ballet company since the 1960s.
[[Nelly Karim]], one of the most famous Egyptian actresses, started her career as a ballerina.

Egypt's [[contemporary]] dance scene is limited but very dynamic. One of the important element of the local independent art scene, contemporary dance in Egypt exists mostly throughout festivals and performances, and thanks to organizations such as [[Cairo contemporary dance center]] in Cairo or [[Rezo Dance]] in Alexandria.

==Cuisine==
{{Main|Egyptian cuisine}}

Egyptian cuisine consists of local culinary traditions such as [[Ful medames]], [[Kushari]], and [[Molokhia]]. It also shares similarities with food found throughout the eastern Mediterranean like [[kebab]] and [[falafel]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7707">A '''diplomatic flag''' is a flag used by a [[sovereign state]] engaging in [[diplomacy]] which is different from the nation's normal [[national flag]]. Some nations also have personal flags that are used by their diplomatic representatives, such as the [[Diplomatic_flag#United_States_of_America|U.S. Foreign Service flags]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://flagspot.net/flags/us_dip.html Flags of the World: Diplomatic and Consular Flags (U.S.)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==National Diplomatic Flag==
Currently, only two nations use diplomatic flags: [[Thailand]] (formerly Siam) and the [[United Kingdom]]. Different flags are used based upon the [[diplomatic rank]] of the mission. British [[High Commissioner (Commonwealth)|High Commissions]] do not use diplomatic flags but rather the normal [[flag of the United Kingdom]], since members of the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] are not considered 'foreign' by the [[government of the United Kingdom]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite|title=The Palgrave Macmillan Dictionary of Diplomacy|year=2012|page=104|first1=G R|last1=Berridge|first2=Lorna|last2=Lloyd|edition=3rd|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="24060">'''Ethnic identity development''' or '''ethnic-racial identity (ERI) development''' includes the [[identity formation]] in an individual's [[self-identification|self-categorization]] in, and psychological attachment to, (an) [[ethnic]] group(s).  Ethnic identity is characterized as part of one’s overarching [[self-concept]] and [[Identity (social science)|identification]]. It is distinct from the [[ethnogenesis|development of ethnic group identities]].

With some few exceptions, ethnic and racial identity development is associated positively with good psychological outcomes, psychosocial outcomes (e.g., better self-beliefs, less depressive symptoms), academic outcomes (e.g., better engagement in school), and health outcomes (e.g., less risk of [[risky sexual behavior]] or drug use).

Development of ethnic identity begins during adolescence&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=French|first=Sabine Elizabeth|last2=Seidman|first2=Edward|last3=Allen|first3=LaRue|last4=Aber|first4=J. Lawrence|title=The development of ethnic identity during adolescence.|url=http://doi.apa.org/getdoi.cfm?doi=10.1037/0012-1649.42.1.1|journal=Developmental Psychology|volume=42|issue=1|pages=1–10|doi=10.1037/0012-1649.42.1.1}}&lt;/ref&gt; but is described as a process of the construction of identity over time&lt;ref name="Phinney" /&gt; due to a combination of experience and actions of the individual&lt;ref name="phinney and ong"&gt;Phinney, J. S. &amp; Ong, A.D. (2007). Conceptualization and measurement of ethnic identity: Current status and future directions. ''Journal of Counseling Psychology, 54,'' 271-281.&lt;/ref&gt; and includes gaining knowledge and understanding of [[ingroups and outgroups|in-group(s)]], as well as a sense of belonging to (an) ethnic group(s). It is important to note that given the vastly different histories of various racial groups, particularly in the United States, that ethnic and racial identity development looks very different between different groups, especially when looking at minority (e.g., Black American) compared to majority (e.g., White American) group comparisons.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Helms|first=Janet|date=1995|title=An update of Helm's White and people of color racial identity models|url=|journal=Annual Multicultural Winter Roundtable|volume=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ethnic identity is sometimes interchanged with, held distinct from, or considered as overlapping with [[racial identity|racial]], [[cultural identity|cultural]] and even [[National identity|national identities]]. This disagreement in the distinction (or lack thereof) between these concepts may originate from the incongruity of definitions of race and ethnicity, as well as the historic conceptualization of models and research surrounding ethnic and racial identity.  Research on racial identity development emerged from the experiences of African Americans during the civil rights movement, however expanded over time to include the experiences of other racial groups.&lt;ref name="Wij"&gt;Wijeyesinghe, C. L., &amp; Jackson, B. W. (2001). New perspectives on racial identity development. New York: NYU Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of racial identity is often misunderstood and can have several meanings which are derived from biological dimensions and social dimensions. Race is socially understood to be derived from an individual's physical features, such as white or black skin tone. The social construction of racial identity can be referred as a sense of group or collective identity based on one's perception that he or she shares a common heritage with a particular racial group. Racial identity is a surface-level manifestation based on what people look like yet has deep implications in how people are treated.&lt;ref name="Chá"&gt;Chávez, A. F. and Guido-DiBrito, F. (1999), Racial and Ethnic Identity and Development. New Directions for Adult and Continuing Education, 1999: 39–47. doi: 10.1002/ace.8405&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Generally, group level processes of ethnic identity have been explored by [[social science]] disciplines, including [[sociology]] and [[anthropology]]. In contrast, [[ethnic identity]] research within [[psychology]] usually focuses on the individual and interpersonal processes.  Within psychology, ethnic identity is typically studied by social, developmental and cross-cultural psychologists.&lt;ref name="encyclopedia"&gt;Phinney, J. Ethnic identity. In A. Kazdin (Ed.), Encyclopedia of Psychology (Vol. 3, pp. 255-259). Washington, DC: American Psychological Association.&lt;/ref&gt;
Models of ethnic development emerged both social and developmental psychology, with different theoretical roots.

===Roots in social psychology===
Ethnic identity emerged in social psychology out of [[social identity theory]]. Social identity theory posits that belonging to social groups (e.g. religious groups or occupational groups) serves an important basis for one’s identity.&lt;ref name="Tajfel"&gt;Tajfel, H. &amp; Turner, J. C. (1986). The social identity theory of inter-group behavior. In S. Worchel &amp; L. W. Austin (Eds.), Psychology of Intergroup Relations. Chicago: Nelson-Hall&lt;/ref&gt; Membership in a group(s), as well as one’s value and emotional significance attached to this membership, is an important part of one’s self-concept. One of the earliest statements of social identity was made by [[Kurt Lewin]], who
emphasized that individuals need a firm sense of group identification
in order to maintain a sense of well-being.&lt;ref name="Lewin"&gt;Lewin, K. (1948). ''Resolving social conflicts''. New York: Harper.&lt;/ref&gt;  Social identity theory emphasizes a need to maintain a positive sense of self. Therefore in respect to ethnic identity, this underscores affirmation to and salience of ethnic group membership(s). In light of this, affirmation of ethnicity has been proposed to be more salient among groups who have faced greater discrimination, in order to maintain self-esteem. There has also been research on family influences, such as cultural values of the family. Also, specific aspects of parenting, such as their racial socialization of youth, can contribute to the socialization of adolescents.&lt;ref name="Cha"&gt;Chao, R. K., &amp; Otsuki-Clutter, M. (2011). Racial and Ethnic Differences: Sociocultural and 
Contextual Explanations. Journal of Research on Adolescence (Blackwell Publishing Limited), 21(1), 47-60. doi:10.1111/j.1532-7795.2010.00714.x&lt;/ref&gt;

Relatedly, [[collective identity]] is an overarching framework for different types of identity development, emphasizing the multidimensionality of group membership.&lt;ref name="Ashmore"&gt;Ashmore, R. D., Deaux, K., &amp; McLaughlin-Volpe, T. (2004). An organizing framework for collective identity: Articulation and significance of multidimensionality. ''Psychological Bulletin'', 130, 80-114.&lt;/ref&gt; Part of collective identity includes positioning oneself psychologically in a group to which you share some characteristic(s). This positioning does not require individuals to have direct contact with all members of the group. The collective identity framework has been related to ethnic identity development, particularly in recognizing the importance of personal identification of ethnicity through categorical membership. Collective identity also includes evaluation of one’s category.&lt;ref name="Ashmore" /&gt; This affective dimension is related to the importance of commitment and attachment toward one’s ethnic group(s).  A behavioral component of collective identity recognizes that individuals reflect group membership through individual actions, such as language usage, in respect to ethnic identity.&lt;ref name="Ashmore"/&gt;

===Roots in developmental psychology===
Identity becomes especially salient during adolescence as recognized by [[Erik Erikson]]’s stage theory of psychosocial development.  An individual faces a specific developmental crisis at each stage of development. In adolescence, identity search and development are critical tasks during what is termed the ‘Identity versus Role-confusion’ stage.
&lt;ref name="Erikson"&gt;Erikson, E.H.(1968). Identity, youth, and crisis. New York: Norton.&lt;/ref&gt;
Achievement of this stage ultimately leads to a stable sense of self.  The idea of an achieved identity includes reconciling identities imposed on oneself with one’s need to assert control and seek out an identity that brings satisfaction, feelings of industry and competence. In contrast, identity confusion occurs when individuals fail to achieve a secure identity, and lack clarity about their role in life.

[[James Marcia]] elaborated on Erik Erikson’s model to include identity formation in a variety of life domains.  Marcia’s focus of identity formation includes two processes which can be applied to ethnic identity development: an exploration of identity and a commitment.&lt;ref name="Marcia"&gt;Marcia, J.E. (1991). Identity  and self development.  In R. Lerner, A. Peterson, &amp; J. Brooks-Gunn (Eds.), ''Encyclopedia of adolescence''(Vol.1). New York: Garland.&lt;/ref&gt; Marcia defines four identity statuses which combines the presence or absence of the processes of exploration and commitment: Identity diffusion (not engaged in exploration or commitment), identity foreclosure (a lack of exploration, yet committed), moratorium (process of exploration without having made a commitment), and identity achievement (exploration and commitment of identity).

Researchers believe and have frequently reported that older individuals are more likely to be in an achieved identity status than younger people. Evidence shows that increasing age and a wide range of life experiences helps individuals develop cognitive skills. This combination of age, life experiences, and improved cognitive skills helps adolescents and young adults find their authentic selves.&lt;ref name="Bra"&gt;Branch, C. (2001). The many faces of self: ego and ethnic identities. The Journal of Genetic Psychology, 162(4), 412-429.&lt;/ref&gt;  Adolescents with strong commitments to their ethnic identities also tend to explore these identities more than their peers.&lt;ref name="Meeus"&gt;Meeus, Wim.  (2011).  The study of adolescent identity formation 2000-2010: a review of longitudinal research.  In Journal of Research on Adolescence, 21(1), 84.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Factors during adolescence ==
While children in early to middle childhood develop the ability to categorize themselves and others using racial and ethnic labels, it is largely during adolescence that ethnic and racial identity develops.

Umaña-Taylor and colleagues&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Umaña-Taylor|first=Adriana J.|last2=Quintana|first2=Stephen M.|last3=Lee|first3=Richard M.|last4=Cross|first4=William E.|last5=Rivas-Drake|first5=Deborah|last6=Schwartz|first6=Seth J.|last7=Syed|first7=Moin|last8=Yip|first8=Tiffany|last9=Seaton|first9=Eleanor|date=2014-01-01|title=Ethnic and Racial Identity During Adolescence and Into Young Adulthood: An Integrated Conceptualization|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/cdev.12196/abstract|journal=Child Development|language=en|volume=85|issue=1|pages=21–39|doi=10.1111/cdev.12196|issn=1467-8624}}&lt;/ref&gt; write about the following concepts as playing key roles during this stage:

Cognitive milestones include: abstract thinking, introspection, metacognition, and further development of social-cognitive abilities.

Physiological changes include puberty and development of body image

Social and environmental context includes: family, peers, social demands and transitions, navigating an expanding world, and media

== Phinney's model of ethnic identity development ==

[[Jean Phinney]]’s model of ethnic identity development is a multidimensional model, with theoretical underpinnings of both Erikson and Marcia.&lt;ref name="Phinney"&gt;Phinney, J. S. (1990). Ethnic identity in adolescents and adults: A review of research. &lt;em&gt;Psychological
Bulletin, 108&lt;/em&gt;, 499–514.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Phinney1989"&gt;Phinney, J. (1989). Stages of ethnic identity in minority group adolescents.
Journal of Early Adolescence, 9, 34-49.&lt;/ref&gt; In line with Erikson's identity formation, Phinney focuses on the adolescent, acknowledging significant changes during this time period, including greater abilities in cognition to contemplate ethnic identity, as well as a broader exposure outside of their own community,  a greater focus on one's social life, and an increased concern for physical appearance.&lt;ref name="Phinney1989" /&gt;

Phinney's Three Stage Progression: 
*Unexamined Ethnic Identity – Prior to adolescence, children either give ethnicity little thought (related to Marcia's diffuse status) or are assumed to have derived their ethnic identity from others, rather than engaging in personal examination. This is related to Marcia's foreclosed identity status.  Knowledge of one's ethnicity is "absorbed", which reflects the process of [[socialization]].
Broadly, socialization in the context of ethnic identity development refers to the acquisition of behaviors, perceptions, values, and attitudes of an ethnic group(s).&lt;ref name="Rotherman"&gt;Rotherman, M., &amp; Phinney, J. (1987). Introduction: Definitions and perspectives in the study of children's ethnic socialization. In J. Phinney &amp; M. Rotherman (Eds.), Children's ethnic socialization: Pluralism and development (pp. 10-28). Beverly Hills, CA: Sage Publications.&lt;/ref&gt; This process recognizes that feelings about one’s ethnic group(s) can be influenced by family, peers, community, and larger society. These contextual systems or networks of influence delineate from [[ecological systems theory]].  These systems influence children’s feelings of belonging and overall affect toward ethnic group(s). Children may internalize both positive and negative messages and therefore hold conflicting feelings about ethnicity. Socialization highlights how early experiences for children are considered crucial in regards to their ethnic identity development.

*Ethnic Identity Search- During the onset of adolescence, there is a questioning of accepted views of ethnicity and a greater understanding of ethnicity in a more abstract sense. Typically this stage has been characterized as being initiated by a significant experience that creates heightened awareness of ethnicity, such as discrimination. Engagement in some form of exploration includes an interest in learning more about one's culture and actively involving oneself in activities such as talking with others about ethnicity, reading books on the subject, and thinking about both the current and future effects of one's ethnicity.&lt;ref name="Phinney1989" /&gt; This stage is related to Erikson's ‘Identity versus Role-confusion’, and Marcia's moratorium.
*Ethnic Identity Achievement- This stage is characterized by clarity about one’s ethnic identity. The achievement phase includes a secure, confident, and stable sense of self.  Achievement also is characterized as a realistic assessment of one's in-group(s) in a larger social context.  In essence, the individual has internalized their ethnicity.This stage is related to Erikson's achieved identity, and identity achievement of Marcia. Identity achievement is also related to social identity theory in that this acceptance replaces one's negative ethnic self-image.&lt;ref name="Phinney1989" /&gt;  Although achievement represents the highest level of ethnic identity development, it should be noted that Phinney believes reexamination can occur depending on experiences over time.&lt;ref name="phinney and ong"/&gt;

More recently, Phinney has focused on the continuous dimensions of one's exploration and commitment to one's ethnic group(s), rather than on distinct identity statuses.&lt;ref name="phinney and ong"/&gt;

==Applications==
Research reveals ethnic identity development is related to psychological well-being.  Ethnic identity has been linked with positive self-evaluation&lt;ref name="Phinney1989" /&gt; and self-esteem.&lt;ref name="Greene"&gt;Greene, M.L., Way, N., Pahl, K. (2006). Trajectories of perceived adult and peer discrimination among black, Latino, and Asian American adolescents: Patterns and psychological correlates. ''Developmental Psychology, 42'', 218-238.&lt;/ref&gt; Ethnic identity development has also been shown to serve as a buffer between perceived discrimination and depression.&lt;ref name="Torres"&gt;Torres, L., &amp; Ong, A. D. (2010). A daily diary investigation of Latino ethnic identity, discrimination, and depression. ''Cultural Diversity and Ethnic Minority Psychology, 16''(4), 561-568.&lt;/ref&gt;
Specifically, commitment of an ethnic identity may help to abate depressive symptoms experienced soon after experiencing discrimination, which in turn alleviates overall stress. Researchers posit commitment to an ethnic identity group(s) is related to additional resources accumulated through the exploration process, including social support.&lt;ref name="Torres" /&gt;   
Ethnic identity development has been linked to happiness and decreased anxiety.  Specifically, regard for one’s ethnic group may buffer normative stress.&lt;ref name="Kiang"&gt;Kiang, L., Yip, T., Gonzales-Backen, M., Witkow, M., &amp; Fuligni, A. J. (2006). Ethnic identity and the daily psychological well-being of adolescents from Mexican and Chinese backgrounds. ''Child Development, 77''(5), 1338-1350.&lt;/ref&gt; Numerous studies show many positive outcomes associated with strong and stable ethnic identities, including increased self-esteem, improved mental health, decreased self-destructive behaviors, and greater academic achievement.&lt;ref name="Ort"&gt;Ortiz, A. M., &amp; Santos, S. J. (2010). Campus diversity and ethnic identity development. Diversity and Democracy, 13(2), 5-7. Retrieved from http://www.diversityweb.org/DiversityDemocracy/vol13no2/ortiz.cfm&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, empirical evidence suggests that ethnic identity exploration may be related to vulnerability to negative outcomes, such as depression.&lt;ref name="Torres" /&gt;  Findings suggest this is due to an individual’s sensitivity to awareness of discrimination and conflicts of positive and negative images of ethnicity during exploration. Also, while commitment to an ethnic group(s) is related to additional resources, exploration is related to a lack of ready-access resources.&lt;ref name="Torres" /&gt;

Studies have found that in terms of family cohesion, the closer adolescents felt to their parents, the more they reported feeling connected to their ethnic group. Given the family is a key source of ethnic socialization, closeness with the family may highly overlap with closeness with one’s ethnic group. Resources like family cohesion, proportion of same-ethnic peers, and ethnic centrality act as correlates of within-person change in ethnic identity, but it is only on the individual level and not as adolescents as a group.&lt;ref name="Kia"&gt;Kiang, L., Witkow, M. R., Baldelomar, O. A., &amp; Fuligni, A. J. (2010). Change in Ethnic Identity Across the High School Years Among Adolescents with Latin American, Asian, and European Backgrounds. Journal of Youth &amp; Adolescence,39(6),683-693. doi:10.1007/s10964-009-9429-5&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other considerations==
Ethnic identity development has been conceptualized and researched primarily within the United States.  Due to the fact the individuals studied are typically from the United States, it may not be appropriate to extend findings or models to individuals in other countries. Some research has been conducted outside of the United States, however a majority of these studies were in Europe or countries settled by Europeans.&lt;ref name="Phinney" /&gt;

Further, researchers also suggest that racial and ethnic identity development must be viewed, studied, and considered alongside the other normative developmental processes (e.g., [[gender identity]] development) and cannot be considered in a vacuum - racial and ethnic identity exist in particular contexts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Williams|first=Joanna Lee|last2=Tolan|first2=Patrick H.|last3=Durkee|first3=Myles I.|last4=Francois|first4=, Amir G.|last5=Anderson|first5=Riana E.|date=2012-09-01|title=Integrating Racial and Ethnic Identity Research Into Developmental Understanding of Adolescents|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1750-8606.2012.00235.x/abstract|journal=Child Development Perspectives|language=en|volume=6|issue=3|pages=304–311|doi=10.1111/j.1750-8606.2012.00235.x|issn=1750-8606}}&lt;/ref&gt;
  
Research considers some studies of ethnic developments cross-sectional in design. This type of design pales in comparison to longitudinal design whose topic of investigation is developmental in nature. This is because cross-sectional studies collect data at or around the same time from multiple individuals of different ages of interest, instead of collecting data over multiple time points for each individual in the study, which would allow the researcher to compare change for individuals over time, as well as differences between individuals.

Another research consideration in the field is why certain ethnic and racial groups are looking towards their own expanding community for mates instead of continuing interracial marriages. An article in ''[[The New York Times]]'' explained that Asian-American couples have been kicking the trend and finding Asian mates because it gives them resurgence of interest in language and ancestral traditions.&lt;ref name="Swarns"&gt;Swarns, R. L. (2012, March 30). For Asian-American Couples, a Tie That Binds. New York Times. Retrieved from https://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/01/fashion/more-asian-americans-marrying-within-their-race.html&lt;/ref&gt; Further research can be found and explored throughout the many different racial and ethnic groups.

Some researchers question the number of dimensions of ethnic identity development. For example, some measures of ethnic identity development include measures of behaviors, such as eating ethnic food or participating in customs specific to an ethnic group.   One argument is that  while behaviors oftentimes express identity, and are typically correlated with identity, ethnic identity is an internal structure that can exist without behavior.&lt;ref name="phinney and ong" /&gt; It has been suggested one can be clear and confident about one's ethnicity, without wanting to maintain customs.&lt;ref name="Phinney" /&gt; Others have found evidence of a behavioral component of ethnic identity development, separate from cognition and affect, and pertaining to one's ethnic identity.&lt;ref name="Gaines"&gt;Gaines, S.O., Bunce, D., Robertson, T., Wright, B. (2010). Evaluating the psychometric properties  of  the Multigroup Ethic Identity Measure (MEIM) within the United Kingdom. ''Identity: An International Journal of Theory and Research, 10,'' 1-19.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ethnic identity development points toward the importance of allowing an individual to self-identify ethnicity during data collection.  This method helps us collect the most accurate and relevant information about the subjective identification of the participant, and can be useful in particular with respect to research with multiethnic individuals.&lt;ref name="Phinney" /&gt;

{{other uses|Exposition (disambiguation)}}

'''Narrative exposition''' is the insertion of important background information within a [[narrative|story]]; for example, information about the [[Setting (narrative)|setting]], characters' [[backstory|backstories]], prior plot events, historical context, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1= |year=2009|title=Kaplan SAT Subject Test: Literature 2009–2010 Edition|publisher=Kaplan Publishing|page=60|isbn=1-4195-5261-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a specifically literary context, exposition appears in the form of [[expository writing]] embedded within the narrative. Exposition is one of four [[rhetorical modes]] (also known as ''modes of discourse''), along with [[description]], [[Argumentation theory|argumentation]], and [[narrative mode|narration]], as elucidated by [[Alexander Bain]] and John Genung.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Smith|first=Carlota S.|title=Modes of Discourse: The Local Structure of Texts|year=2003|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-78169-5|page=40|url=https://books.google.com/?id=okPPSq1G1OQC&amp;pg=PA40&amp;lpg=PA40&amp;dq=Bain+and+genung#v=onepage&amp;q=Bain%20and%20genung&amp;f=false|accessdate=10 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each of the rhetorical modes is present in a variety of forms, and each has its own purpose and [[Convention (norm)|conventions]]. There are several ways to accomplish exposition.

&lt;!-- THIS SECTION ACTUALLY IS ABOUT "INCLUING"—NOT "INCLUDING."  PLEASE READ THE ARTICLE BEFORE EDITING. --&gt;
'''Indirect exposition''', sometimes called '''incluing''', is a technique of [[worldbuilding]] in which the reader is gradually exposed to background information about the world in which a story is set. The idea is to ''clue'' the readers in to the world the author is building without them being aware of it. This can be done in a number of ways: through [[Dialogue in writing|dialogues]], [[flashback (narrative)|flashbacks]], characters' thoughts,&lt;ref name="Dibell 1988 51" /&gt; background details, [[in-universe]] media,&lt;ref name="Morrell 2006 64"&gt;{{cite book|title=Between the Lines: Master the Subtle Elements of Fiction Writing|first=Jessica Page|last=Morrell |publisher=Writer's Digest Books|location=Cincinnati, Ohio|page=64|year=2006|isbn=978-1-58297-393-7|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the narrator telling a [[backstory]].&lt;ref name="Dibell 1988 51"&gt;{{cite book|title=Plot|first=Ansen|last=Dibell|publisher=Writer’s Digest Books|location=Cincinnati, OH|year= 1988|isbn=0-89879-303-3|ref=harv}} *{{cite book|title=Building Better Plots|first=Robert|last=Kernen|publisher=Writer’s Digest Books|location= Cincinnati, Ohio|page=51|year=1999|isbn=0-89879-903-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead of saying "I am a woman", a first person narrator can say "I kept the papers inside my purse." The reader (in most English-speaking cultures) now knows the character is probably female.&lt;ref&gt;[http://rachelsimon.com/wwg_exposition_v2.php The Writer's Writing Guide: Exposition]&lt;/ref&gt;

Indirect exposition has always occurred in storytelling incidentally, but is first clearly identified, in the modern literary world, in the writing of [[Rudyard Kipling]]. In his stories set in [[India]] like ''[[The Jungle Book]]'', Kipling was faced with the problem of Western readers not knowing the culture and environment of that land, so he gradually developed the technique of explaining through example. But this was relatively subtle, compared to Kiplings' [[science fiction]] stories, where he used the technique much more obviously and necessarily, to explain an entirely fantastic world unknown to any reader, in his [[Aerial Board of Control]] universe.&lt;ref&gt;[http://esr.ibiblio.org/?p=234 Rudyard Kipling Invented SF]&lt;/ref&gt;

Kipling's writing influenced other science fiction writers, most notably the "Dean of Science Fiction", [[Robert A. Heinlein#Writing style|Robert Heinlein]], who became known for his advanced rhetorical and storytelling techniques, including indirect exposition. 

The word ''incluing'' is attributed to fantasy and science fiction author [[Jo Walton]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Michelle Bottorff|url=http://www.lshelby.com/rasfcFAQ.html|title=rec.arts.sf.composition Frequently Asked Questions |publisher=Lshelby.com|date=11 June 2008|accessdate=6 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; She defined it as "the process of scattering information seamlessly through the text, as opposed to stopping the story to impart the information."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://papersky.livejournal.com/324603.html|title=papersky: Thud: Half a Crown &amp; Incluing|publisher=Papersky.livejournal.com|date= |accessdate=6 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Information dump" (or info-dump) is the term given for overt exposition, which writers want to avoid.&lt;ref name=Bell&gt;{{cite book|last=Bell|first=James Scott|title=Write Great Fiction – Plot &amp; Structure|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cL1MCUXmqdcC&amp;pg=PT78|date=22 September 2004|publisher=Writer's Digest Books|isbn=978-1-58297-684-6|page=78}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;=http://www.screenplayology.com/content-sections/screenplay-form-content/3-3/&lt;/ref&gt; In an ''idiot lecture'', characters tell each other information that needs to be explained for the purpose of the audience, but of which the characters in-universe would already be aware.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=John Ashmead|author2=Darrell Schweitzer|author3=George H.

'''Fertility in art''' refers to any [[artistic work]] representing or portraying [[fertility]], which usually refers to successful breeding among humans, although it may also mean successful [[agriculture]] and [[animal husbandry]].  It includes engravings, drawings, [[paintings]], [[sculptures]], [[figurines]], [[portraits]] and even [[literary works]]. In [[Paleolithic art]], fertility is usually associated with figurines with exaggerated parts of human anatomy. 

Many civilisations in history believed in fertility [[deities]]. In [[Classical mythology]], [[Gaia (mythology)|Gaia]] (to the [[Greeks]]) or [[Terra (mythology)|Terra]] (to the [[Romans]]), the personification of [[Earth]], is associated with [[female fertility]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.goddess-guide.com/greek-goddess-of-the-earth.html Greek Goddess of the Earth&lt;/ref&gt; Women are often depicted with a ripe [[bosom]], a child-bearing [[hip]] and a [[nude]] body in some cases.&lt;ref name=Fertility&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2008/mar/30/art.familyandrelationships Laura Cumming on fertility in art&lt;/ref&gt; Animals that [[reproduce]] prolifically are also seen in art depicting fertility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.ae/books?id=9xkhBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT577&amp;lpg=PT577&amp;dq=Animals+that+%5B%5Breproduce%5D%5D+prolifically+are+also+seen+in+art+depicting+fertility.&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=La01CAx3OF&amp;sig=bIowIpN3ZECwWjj3zvnf2akWJL4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjxrIDa1c7TAhXFPBoKHYhTBboQ6AEIMjAD#v=onepage&amp;q=Animals+that+%5B%5Breproduce%5D%5D+prolifically+are+also+seen+in+art+depicting+fertility.&amp;f=false|title=Animals into Art|first=Howard|last=Morphy|date=30 October 2014|publisher=Routledge|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Traditional cultures==
[[File:Wien NHM Venus von Willendorf.jpg|thumb|170px|left|[[Venus of Willendorf]], considered to be an example of fertility in art.]]
Fertility was present in art traditionally in many different forms. These include ceramic figures from some [[Pre-Columbian]] cultures, and a few figures from most of the ancient Mediterranean cultures. Many of these seem to be connected with fertility. Palielothic statuettes had round [[abdomen|bellies]], short [[heads]] and short, pointed [[legs]]. They also exaggerate the [[hips]], breasts, [[thighs]], or [[vulva]] of the subject.

Two of the earliest known possible depictions of fertility in art are the ''[[Venus of Willendorf]]'' (c. 25,000 [[BCE]]), an [[Oolite|oolitic]] [[limestone]] figurine of a woman whose breasts and hips have been exaggerated to emphasise her fertility found in [[Austria]] and the ''Fertility Goddess'' of Cernavoda (c. 5,000 BCE) found in [[Romania]], a small figurine that is meant to possibly show fertility. Historians consider these figurines to be goddesses. It is believed that worshippers would push the pointed legs into the earth to erect a temporary [[shrine]] for the goddess. The rotundity and [[obesity]] of these figurines were seen as attractive in early times when [[food]] was scarce.&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, 747&lt;/ref&gt;

==Western art==
===Early forms===
[[File:TITIAN - Venus Anadyomene (National Galleries of Scotland, c. 1520. Oil on canvas, 75.8 x 57.6 cm).jpg|thumb|220px|[[Titian]], copy of the ''[[Venus Anadyomene]]'' ]]
[[Fertility]] is often shown in artworks related to [[Classical mythology]]. Paintings of the [[Greek goddess]] of love [[Aphrodite (mythology)|Aphrodite]] ([[Venus (mythology)|Venus]] to the [[Romans]]) often portray her as [[Human sexual activity|sexual]] and fertile. [[Homer]]'s ''[[Iliad]]'' states that Aphrodire (Venus) was born from the sperm/foam of the castrated genitals of [[Uranus (mythology)|Uranus]]. ''[[Venus Anadyomene]]'' is a painting by [[Apelles]] that shows Aphrodite rising from the sea. The original painting is now lost, but a colossal copy of the painting exists, painted by the artist [[Titian]] and known as [[Venus Anadyomene (Titian)|''Venus Anadyomene'' by Titian]]. It depicts Venus (Aphrodite) rising from the sea and wringing her wet hair after her birth, a pose inspired by an account of the original painting by Apelles.&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, 140 &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nationalgalleries.org/art-and-artists/8687/venus-rising-sea-venus-anadyomene-about-1520 Venus Rising from the Sea ('Venus Anadyomene') (About 1520)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Demeter]], the Greek goddess of [[agriculture]], [[grain crops]], [[fertility]] and motherly relationships is often shown carrying a basket of [[apples]] in [[sculptures]], which are meant to show fertility.&lt;ref name=Fertility/&gt;
[[File:Ostara by Johannes Gehrts.jpg|thumb|170px|left|[[Johannes Gehrts]]: Eostre, the [[Germanic mythology|Germanic goddess]] flies through the heavens surrounded by Roman-inspired [[putti]], beams of light, rabbits and birds. Germanic people look up at the goddess from the realm below.]]

[[Hares]] are often portrayed in art as a symbol of [[reincarnation|rebirth]] and fertility.&lt;ref&gt;C. G. Jung, ''Man and his Symbols'' (1964)p. 99&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Germanic mythology|Germanic]] goddess [[Eostre]], whose [[theme (arts)|themes]] are fertility and rebirth, is often surrounded by hares in art. 
In Christianity, white rabbits are considered to be symbols of rebirth and fertility and are seen on a wing of the high altar in [[Freiburg Minster]], where they are playing at the feet of two pregnant women, [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Mary]] and [[Elizabeth_(biblical_figure)|Elizabeth]].
In [[Jan Van Eyck]]'s ''[[Arnolfini portrait]]'', a carving of [[Margaret the Virgin|St. Margaret of Antioch]] (patron saint of childbirth) appears in the center background of the painting. The presence of this symbol in the painting either promises fertility in the marriage or announces the pregnancy of the bride.&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, 749 &lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern===
[[Paula Modersohn-Becker]]'s series of self-portraits showing her pregnant even before she had actually been so represent her fertility.&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, 64 &lt;/ref&gt;

[[Rembrandt]]'s ''[[The Jewish Bride]]'' is a painting of a couple joined in love. Despite the title, none of the subjects in the painting are [[Jewish]]. The Painting portrays the [[fertility]] of the young couple, particularly that of the woman.

The shoe tied to the happy couple's car can be seen to represent the fertile vagina, as with [[There was an Old Woman Who Lived in a Shoe|The Old Woman Who Lived in a Shoe]], a nursery rhyme.&lt;ref&gt;G. Legman, ''The Rationale of the Dirty Joke'' (1973) Vol II p. 90&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Botticelli]]'s ''Primavera'', on one hand the [[Charites|Three Graces]] represented by nubile young women embody the sexual powers of springtime while opposite them [[Flora (mythology)|Flora]], the goddess of Spring is a symbol of motherhood and, by her distribution of the roses gathered in her skirt, believed to represent the good things of life.&lt;ref&gt;Edmund Swinglehurts, ''Botticelli'' (1994) p. 26-7&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Picasso]]' paintings of [[Marie-Thérèse Walter]], everywhere there is green, the colour of fertility and nature's renewal.&lt;ref&gt;John Golding, in D. H Kahnweiler et al eds., ''Picasso 1881/1973'' (1973) p. 184&lt;/ref&gt; In his series of sleeping nudes, Picasso may have been influenced by the much reproduced [[Hal Saflieni Hypogeum|Hal Saflieni]] ''Reclining Woman'' and the Venuses of [[Venus of Lespugue|Lespugue]] and Willendorf, which with their heavy, ripe, bulging forms can be viewed as ancestresses of Picasso's images of female fecundity.&lt;ref&gt;Golding, p. 115-6&lt;/ref&gt;

===Literature===
In ''[[The Bacchae]]'', an [[Classical Greece|ancient Greek]] [[tragedy]] written by [[Classical Athens|Athenian]] playwright [[Euripides]], Dionysus is mentioned as a male fertility god that represented a special kind of vitality that is sometimes referred to as the [[Energy (esotericism)|Life Force]]. It is described a force which, in itself, is neither good nor bad, but one that simply exists.&lt;ref&gt;Neil Curry trans., ''Euripides'' (Cambridge 1981) p. 164 and p. 116&lt;/ref&gt;

When at the close of [[Possession (Byatt novel)|''Possession: A Romance'']], a novel by [[A. S. Byatt]], the two lovers Randolph Henry Ash and Christabel LaMotte finally unite in the midst of a great storm. They wake the next day to find that the whole world had a strange new smell. It is described as 'a green smell, a smell of shredded leaves and oozing resin, of crushed wood and splashed sap, a tart smell, which bore some relation to the smell of bitten apples.' It was the described as the smell of death and destruction, however, it was said to smell fresh, lively and hopeful.&lt;ref&gt;A. S. Byatt, ''Possession: A Romance'' (1991) p. 507&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Goethe-Institut''' ({{IPA-de|ˈɡøːtə ʔɪnstiˌtuːt|lang}}, '''GI''', "{{lang-en|Goethe Institute}}") is a non-profit [[Germany|German]] [[culture|cultural]] association operational worldwide with 159 institutes, promoting the study of the [[German language]] abroad and encouraging international [[cultural exchange]] and relations. Around 246.000 people take part in these German courses per year.

The Goethe-Institut fosters knowledge about Germany by providing information on German culture, society and politics. This includes the exchange of [[film]]s, [[music]], [[theatre]], and [[literature]]. Goethe cultural societies, reading rooms, and exam and language centers have played a role in the cultural and educational policies of Germany for more than 60 years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dw.de/dw/article/0,,15277312,00.html Goethe-Institut looks back on 60 years of cultural exchange], 29 August 2011, ''Deutsche Welle'', accessed 9 May 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is named after [[German literature|German]] poet and statesman [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]]. The Goethe-Institut e.V. is autonomous and politically independent.

Partners of the institute and its centers are public and private cultural institutions, the federal states, local authorities and the world of commerce. Much of the Goethe-Institut's overall budget consists of yearly grants from the German Foreign Office and the German Press Office. The relationship with the Foreign Office is governed by general agreement. Self-generated income and contributions from sponsors and patrons, partners and friends broaden the scope of the work of the Goethe-Institut.

==History==
*1951: The Goethe-Institut was founded as successor to the German Academy (''[[Deutsche Akademie]]/DA''), which was founded in 1925. Its first task was to provide further training for foreign German teachers in Germany.
*1952: The first Goethe-Institut opens in Athens.
*1953: The first language courses run by the Goethe-Institut began in Bad Reichenhall. Due to growing demand, new centres of learning were opened in Murnau and Kochel, the focus of selection being on towns which were small and idyllic and which showed post-war Germany at its best. Lessons were taught from the first textbook developed by the Goethe-Institut, the now legendary "Schulz-Griesbach".
*1953–55: The first foreign lectureships of what was the German Academy were taken on by the Goethe-Institut. Responsibilities include German tuition, teacher training and providing a program of cultural events to accompany courses.
*1959–60: On the initiative of the head of the arts sector of the Foreign Office, [[Dieter Sattler]], the Goethe-Institut gradually took over all of the German cultural institutes abroad.
*1968: Influenced by the student revolts of the late 1960s the Goethe-Institut readjusted its program of cultural events to include socio-political topics and avant-garde art.
*1970: Acting on behalf of the Foreign Office, Ralf Dahrendorf developed his "guiding principles for foreign cultural policy". Cultural work involving dialog and partnership was declared the third pillar of German foreign policy. During the Willy Brandt era, the concept of "extended culture" formed the basis of activities at the Goethe-Institut.
*1976: The Foreign Office and the Goethe-Institut signed a general agreement governing the status of the Goethe-Institut, henceforth an independent cultural organization.
*1980: A new concept regarding the location of institutes within Germany was drawn up. Places of instruction in small towns, mostly in Bavaria, were replaced by institutes in cities and university towns.
*1989/90: The fall of the Berlin Wall marked a turning point for the Goethe-Institut. Its activities in the 1990s were centred on Eastern Europe. Numerous new institutes were set up as a result.
*2001: The Goethe-Institut merges with Inter Nationes.
*2004: The Goethe-Institut established the first Western information centre in Pyongyang, North Korea (closed in 2009).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,,4928516,00.html Goethe-Institut to close center in North Korea on censorship claim], 26 November 2009, ''Deutsche Welle'', accessed 9 May 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; The Goethe-Institut Inter Nationes also reverted to its original and official name, Goethe-Institut (GI).
*2005: The Goethe-Institut was honored with the Prince-of-Asturias Prize of Spain.
*2007: For the first time in more than ten years, the German parliament increased the funds of the Goethe-Institut.
*2010: [[Bruno Bozzetto]] created a new Goethe-Institut film named "Va Bene".
*2014: A Myanmar Goethe-Institut opens

The Goethe-Institut is mainly financed by the national government of Germany, and has around 3,000 employees and an overall budget of approximately 366 million [[euro]]s at its disposal, more than half of which is generated from language course tuition and examination fees. The Goethe-Institut offers scholarships, including tuition waiver, to students from foreign countries, who want to become teachers of German. One of the selection criteria for these scholarships is social or financial need.

The '''Gourmet Museum and Library''' ({{lang-fr|Bibliothèque et musée de la Gourmandise}}) is a [[museum]] dedicated to the [[history]] of [[gastronomy]], located in [[Hermalle-sous-Huy]], [[Liège (province)|province of Liège]], [[Belgium]].

==Overview==
===Library===
[[File:Bibliothèque de la Gourmandise.jpg|thumb|Reading room]]
It is the most important collection of [[food]] and [[drink]] [[book]]s in [[Belgium]] and one of the twenty largest in [[Europe]].
The books, mainly old, are about [[food]], [[art]]s of the table and [[tobacco]], mainly in Europe and particularly in Belgium. They are classified by subjects: [[biography|biographies]], [[history]], [[biography|biographies]], [[recipe]]s, [[religious]] [[cookery]], [[child]]ren’s cookery, [[dietetics]], [[vegetarianism]], [[veganism]], [[home economics]], [[sociology]], [[food chemistry]], publicities, [[iconography]], [[literature]], [[music]], etc.

The data-processing encoding is modern. An outline of the [[Library catalog|catalogue]] is reproduced on the website. This library has the only specimen of the ''Cuisinier anglais''.

The library also has other specialities:
* Art History and [[archaeology]]
* [[Dance]] and [[choreography]]
* Local and dialectal Archives
* History of the [[Post office]] and of the [[Script (performing arts)|script]] (funds created in 2004 with the Museum “Postes restantes” located in the same building).

The works are consultable on written request and appointment, given the [[wikt:voluntary|voluntary]] help of the librarians.

===Museum===
[[File:Une-salle-du-musée2.jpg|thumb|One of the rooms of the museum]]
Authentic objects of gastronomy, original [[painting]]s, [[furniture]], [[masterpiece]]s and objects of [[curiosity]], etc. are laid out in [[vault (architecture)|vaulted]] rooms of the 17th [[century]].
The visits are always guided: the visitors are accompanied by a [[guide]] which explains, in an attractive and humorous way, the history of the [[cookery]] by taking its interlocutors into account. The children, the elderly, the [[disabled]] person find here an adapted reception. The association received the Belgium price CAP48 2009 for this policy&lt;ref&gt;Guy Van den Noortgate, ''Prix catégorie Accessibilité. La Rawète a adapté ses musées'', Business Trends-Tendances, 2010 January 28.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Exhibitions===
Library and museum also organize in situ temporary [[art exhibition|exhibitions]] ; they take part in cultural big events (like Made in Belgium in [[Brussels]]), and collaborate with other museums or institutions for [[research]].

==Further activities==
From 2002, the [[Nonprofit organization|NPO]] founder organizes guided [[walk]]s for the discovery of a particular gastronomic [[Natural heritage|heritage]]: the [[Eating|edible]] wild plants. In addition, the tavern of the museums proposes dishes according to recipes from the library ; it thus allows the public to taste an old and [[regional]] cooking.

==Sites of activity==
Library and museum are installed in the “[[Ferme castrale of Hermalle-sous-Huy]]” (in the administrative entity of [[Engis]]), old farm of the contiguous castle.
The buildings, which date from 17th and 18th centuries, can be the subject of a guided visit for groups. In addition to diary and tourist information in English, the website offers, in its French part, feature articles on particular subjects of gastronomy.

'''Herbartianism''' (Her-bart-ti-an-ism) is an educational philosophy, movement, and method loosely based on the educational and pedagogical thought of German educator [[Johann Friedrich Herbart]], and influential on American school pedagogy of the late 19th century as the field worked towards a science of education. Herbart advocated for instruction that introduced new ideas in discrete steps. About a quarter-century after his death, Herbart's ideas were expanded in two German schools of thought that were later embodied in the method used at a practice school in [[Jena]], which attracted educationists from the United States. Herbartianism was later replaced by new pedagogies, such as those of [[John Dewey]].

== Description ==

[[File:Johann Friedrich Herbart.jpg|thumb|Herbart]]

Herbartianism was used most often in adolescent instruction and was greatly influential on American school pedagogy in the 19th century.&lt;ref name=EB/&gt; Herbart believed in maintaining the integrity of a student's individuality for as long as possible during the education process as well as an emphasis on moral training.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=1894|title=EVERYDAY USE OF HERBARTIANISM|jstor=44040318|journal=The Journal of Education|volume=40|issue=5 (979)|pages=93–94}}&lt;/ref&gt; The goal of herbartiainsim was to aid students in their learning process, beginning from no knowledge to complete knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07248a.htm|title=CATHOLIC ENCYCLOPEDIA: Herbart and Herbartianism|website=www.newadvent.org|access-date=2018-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Herbart's pedagogical method was divided into discrete steps: preparation, presentation, association, generalization, and application.&lt;ref name=EB/&gt; In preparation, teachers introduce new material in relation to the students' existing knowledge or interests, so as to instill an interest in the new material. In presentation, the new material is shown in a concrete or material fashion. In association, the new material is compared with the students' previous knowledge for similarities and differences, so as to note the new material's distinction. In generalization, the new material is extrapolated beyond concrete and material traits. In application, if the students have internalized the new material, they apply it towards every facet of their lives rather than in a utilitarian manner.&lt;ref name=EB/&gt; Through this process, students will be able to achieve complete knowledge on the curriculum being taught. Herbartianism provided terminology for didactic theory and helped improve teachers professionalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx|title="The Development of C. A. Mcmurry's Type Study: Emergence of a Unit Development Theory Embedding Teacher Training."|last=Fujimoto|first=Kazuhisa|date=March 1, 2014|website=search.ebscohost.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Rise and influence ==

[[File:Wilhelm Rein (IZ 44-1865 S 416).jpg|thumb|Rein later ran the Jena school, whose ideas were imported into American school pedagogy]]

While the term ''Herbartianism'' derives transparently from Herbart's name, the movement was only loosely connected to his own ideas and was not an organized practice until 25 years after his death in 1841. Herbartianism was developed from Herbart's philosophy,&lt;ref name="HEQ General Pedagogy"/&gt; and divided into two schools of thought. In the first, [[Tuiskon Ziller]] of [[Leipzig]] expanded on Herbart's philosophy of "unification of studies", especially around a single discipline (called "correlation" and "concentration", respectively).&lt;ref name="Credo"/&gt; In the second, Karl Stoy of [[Jena]] opened a practice school in the style of Herbart's [[Königsberg]] school. A student of Ziller and Stoy, [[Wilhelm Rein]], later led the Jena school and designed a German elementary school curriculum that the school used. This school became "the center of Herbartian theory and practice and attracted students of pedagogy from outside Germany, including the United States".&lt;ref name="Credo"/&gt;

Between the 1890s and the early twentieth century, Herbartianism was influential in [[normal schools]] and universities as they worked towards a science of education.&lt;ref name="Credo"/&gt; Adherents of Herbartianism founded the National Herbart Society in 1895&lt;ref name=EB/&gt; "to study and investigate and discuss important problems of education".&lt;ref name="Credo"/&gt; Among those prominent in the society were [[Charles De Garmo]] (their first president), [[Charles Alexander McMurry]], and [[Frank Morton McMurry]], who all wrote on methods in education. The society also acknowledged works influenced by Herbartianism, such as two works by [[John Dewey]], within a yearbook. The society removed Herbart from its name in 1902 and later became the National Society for the Study of Education.&lt;ref name="Credo"/&gt;

== Decline ==

Newer pedagogical theories, such as those of John Dewey, eventually replaced Herbartianism.&lt;ref name=EB/&gt; Though Herbartian work is unpopular in the 21st century, its greatest influence was in the 19th century's "development of the science of education".&lt;ref name="Credo"/&gt; In the 1996 ''Philosophy of Education: An Encyclopedia'', J. J. Chambliss wrote that Herbartianism's influence shows wherever "thinking, moral judgment, and conduct" are considered simultaneously.&lt;ref name="Credo"/&gt;

The '''''Hotsuma Tsutae''''' (also ''Hotuma Tsutaye'', Japanese 秀真伝) is an elaborate [[epic poem]] of [[Japanese mythology|Japanese legendary history]] which differs substantially from the mainstream version as recorded in the ''[[Kojiki]]'' and the ''[[Nihon Shoki]]''. Its antiquity is undetermined.

Although many proponents allege that the Hotsuma predates the mainstream mythology, the first known manuscript was dedicated to a shrine by Waniko Yasutoshi (also known as Yunoshin Ibo) in 1775. Some excerpts were published and translated into modern Japanese in 1884, a printing which was noted by [[Hirata Atsutane]] in his work on ''[[jindai moji]]'', a Japanese writing system developed prior to the use of Chinese characters, but which otherwise ignored the work. Atsutane's [[Kokugaku]] was principally concerned with the ''Kojiki'' and the ''Hotsuma Tsutae'' would have only muddled his theories. Yasutoshi's manuscript was almost lost, but was discovered and rescued in 1993 following the publication of some popular books on the subject in the mid-20th century by Yoshinosuke Matsumoto.

The ''Hotsuma Tsutae'' is known for its text and rhythm. It was written in ''[[yamato-kotoba]]'', which only uses a Japanese vocabulary which predates contact with China. Some of the ''yamato-kotoba'' used in ''Hotsuma Tsutae'' are unattested elsewhere in the Old Japanese corpus but have parallels to old words, meaning that if it is a late medieval hoax it is extremely elaborate. Among other things in its primarily historical and non-mythological record, the text discusses the births, lives, and deaths of ''[[kami]]'' from Japanese folk shrines and history; in this case, the word ''kami'' being used to mean something like royalty and not "gods". In the poem, [[Amaterasu]], the sun ''kami'' of Shinto, is male, and not female as is written in the official records. Matsumoto theorizes that Amaterasu was feminized in the ''Kojiki'' and ''Nihon Shoki'' to provide a justification for the reign of [[Empress Suiko]] who reigned just before those documents were written.

Although for the most part Japanese academics remain uninterested in this text, some scholars are of the opinion that it may have been written in the [[Edo period]]. This is due to claims that the text was written in an original Japanese alphabet - in academic circles, the existence of writing in Japan before the use of Chinese characters is denied, also the alphabet does not reflect the Old Japanese phonology but rather those of later stages of Japanese. The general opinion is that it is a [[false document]]. However, no definitive conclusion has yet been reached.

The term '''Ionian''' (or '''Heptanese''') '''School of Music''' ([[Greek language|Greek]]: Επτανησιακή Σχολή, literally: "[[Ionian Islands|Seven Islands]]' School") denotes the musical production of a group of [[Ionian Islands|Heptanesian]] composers, whose heyday was from the early 19th century till approximately the 1950s. Conventionally, it is divided in two periods: the First Generation (Πρὠτη Γενιά) from 1815, till the end of the 1860s, and the Second Generation (Δεύτερη Γενιά) from 1871 and onwards. Prominent representatives of this genre include [[Nikolaos Mantzaros]], [[Spyridon Xyndas]], [[Spyridon Samaras]], [[Pavlos Carrer]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Xepapadakou|first=Avra|date=2013|title=Pavlos Carrer [Paolo Karrer]|url=https://www.academia.edu/15628365/_Carrer_Carreris_Pavlos_Carrer_Paolo_Karrer_Paul_Grove_Music_Dictionary_ed._by_Deane_Root_New_York_Oxford_University_Press_2013|journal=Academia|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Dionysios Lavrangas]].
The Music Museum of the [[Philharmonic Society of Corfu]] has in its collections several scores by these and other 19th and 20th century Ionian composers.

The major inspiration for the Ionian School was considered to be the [[Italian classical music#19th century|Italian musical tradition]]. However, as late as the 1820s composers from Ionian Islands succeeded in shaping their own path towards 'national music' initially by using the Greek vernacular language, and later by incorporating folklore elements both from the local tradition and from that of mainland Greece.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9410">'''J-Setting''' is a style of dance popularized by the '''Prancing J-Settes''', a popular collegiate female dance team of the [[Jackson State University]]'s [[Sonic Boom of the South]] marching band. It originated in the late 1970s from African-Americans in the [[Jackson, Mississippi]], area of the United States.

This dance style is characterized by a lead and follow format where one dancer initiates a series of high-energy dance moves, and the other dancers join in the movement. J-Setting features specific dance steps based on Prancing J-Settes marching techniques including the "J-Sette Walk," the "Salt and Pepper," the "Strut," and the "Tip Toe". In particular, the "Salt and Pepper" is a type of prance step for which the Prancing J-Settes are named and known. It is a high-knee lift or "high step" style of marching. Alternating legs lift with a bent knee to bring the foot up to the height of the opposite knee before returning the foot to the ground.

The JSU Prancing J-Settes typically march and perform in rows organized by height. J-Setting dancers also typically perform in a line or in multiple lines.  While performing, dancers may also change dance formation similar to the way that marching bands change formation during shows on football fields.

The J-Setting style of dress is modeled after the dance uniforms of the JSU Prancing J-Settes.  It normally includes a one or two piece [[bodysuit]] or form-fitting garment that covers the torso and crotch; and hosiery with knee high boots on the legs.  However, other types of garments are also worn during a performance.

==History and background==
{{original research|section|date=April 2015}}
In 1970, Shirley Middleton and the other [[majorettes]] of the Jackson State University Marching Band met with then JSU president, Dr. John A. Peoples, to request that they be permitted to "put down their batons." The JSU President agreed; and as the majorette sponsor, Middleton assembled 18 female students to become the first Jaycettes (currently called J-Settes). Middleton, a formally trained ballet dancer, established technical performance standards for the J-Settes, as well as, standards for academic and personal behavior for its members when they were not performing. Dr. Jimmie James, Jr., then Chair of the JSU Department of Music, described the new dance team as "the thrill of a thousand eyes." During Middleton's tenure, performances included dance routines to songs such as "James Brown's "Make it Funky," and "Hot Pants" as performed by the JSU Marching Band.

Prior to 1975, Hollis Pippins, a former baton twirler for the JSU marching band, sometimes assisted J-Settes director Shirley Middleton, with choreography. In addition to performing with the JSU marching band, he performed on "Soul Train" and "Putting on the Hits" national television shows; and on "Black Gold", a local TV show. In 1975, Narah Oatis was appointed the sponsor of the Prancing J-Settes. Under her leadership, the "J-Sette Walk" and other signature marching steps were developed, and performances included an appearance on the "30th Anniversary of Motown" television show in 1990.

During the late 1970s, African American gay men who were fans of The Prancing J-Settes regularly attended the dance team's practice sessions, and performances at college football games and other events. Young gay men brought the J-Settes dance style back to their home towns, and to gay nightclubs like Club City Lights in Jackson, Mississippi; Club Skittles Baton Rouge; Incognito, Allusions, and 901 in Memphis; and Club 708 in Atlanta.

Although the Prancing J-Settes is a female dance team, in 1997 male JSU baton twirler DeMorris Adams performed with the J-Settes in place of an injured female member. However, the Prancing J-Settes have not confirmed this and, in fact, some have stated that it is not true. There is also no footage to substantiate this claim.

By the mid 2000s, J-Setting became popular in clubs such as: Club Candy'z, Splash [[Baton Rouge]]; Club Metro [[Jackson, Mississippi|Jackson]]; Woodward, Tom Philips Post [[Detroit]]; Club 2020 [[Houston]]; Club Rush/ Chap [[Atlanta]]; Club Crystal's [[Lake Charles, Louisiana|Lake Charles]]; Central Station [[Shreveport]]; and The Brick [[Dallas]].  Also several [[black gay pride]] events host organized J-Sette battles.

==Mainstream media attention==
In 1990, the Prancing J-Settes performed the J-Settes style of marching and dancing on the "30th Anniversary of Motown" television show. The dance team appeared as part of the JSU Marching Band in performances to "I Heard it through the Grapevine"and other songs. A video of part of this performance is available on YouTube.&lt;ref name="Motown 30th Anniversary"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZU0tTSS8qQ|title= Motown 30th (Part 1) |accessdate= 2014-03-22|author= Welcome to my channel|date= 2010-09-09|publisher= YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, the Prancing J-Settes performed the J-Settes marching and dancing style on the "34th NAACP Image Awards" television show. The dance team appeared as part of the JSU Marching Band in performances with comedian "Cedric the Entertainer" and "Sugar Bear of E.U." A video of part of this performance is available on YouTube.&lt;ref name="34th NAACP Image Awards"&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3CzbDtyyUc|title=34th NAACP Image Awards|accessdate= 2014-03-22|author=Jackson State University|date= 2009-08-18|publisher= YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, both [[Beyoncé]]'s "[[Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)]]" and "[[Diva (Beyoncé song)|Diva]]" music videos included a J-Setting style dance routine.&lt;ref name="Single Ladies Music Video"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4m1EFMoRFvY|title=Single Ladies|accessdate= 2014-03-22|author=BeyonceVevo|date= 2009-10-02|publisher= YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Diva Music Video"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNM5HW13_O8|title=Diva|accessdate= 2014-03-22|author=BeyonceVevo|date= 2009-10-02|publisher= YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; Choreographer Frank Gatson is credited with introducing the J-Setting dance style to Beyoncé.

J-Setting troupes compete in dance-offs at gay cultural events.  These groups of young gay men and women imitate the JSU Prancing J-Settes marching and dance style and dress.  
These dance groups perform in costumes that are similar in appearance to the JSU J-Settes uniforms; including sequined one- and two-piece [[leotard]]s, with long flowing capes, sheer stockings and white marching boots. Some of the popular J-Setting teams include: Jackson's Male Prancing J-Settes (MPJ); Memphis Elite; Atlanta's J-Phi; Texas Southern Heat; Texas Teasers of Dallas; D.M.B. of Atlanta; Atlanta Toxic; Jus Blaze; Dallas Diamonds; Baton Rouge Xtreme; Detroit Danz Zone; Nashville's Music City All-Starz; Capitol City Dolls International; Prancing Elites; Shreveport Pussy Cat Dolls; and Grambling, La.'s X-Men.

The competitions seen in Lifetime's [[Bring It! (TV series)|Bring It!]] were inspired by J-Setting competitions.

Beginning April 22, 2015, the [[Oxygen (TV channel)|Oxygen]] channel began broadcasting a 12-episode documentary series entitled ''[[The Prancing Elites Project]]'', focusing on the J-Setting group from [[Mobile, Alabama]].&lt;ref&gt;Tre'velle Anderson, [http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/tv/la-et-st-prancing-elites-oxygen-docu-series-20150423-story.html "Prancing Elites spread message of acceptance in Oxygen docu-series"], ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', April 22, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence Specker, [http://www.al.com/entertainment/index.ssf/2015/04/laughter_and_hope_as_the_pranc.html "Laughter and hope, as 'The Prancing Elites Project' premieres"], ''[[Al.com]]'', April 22, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Prancing Elites had begun to attract national attention after a complimentary [[Twitter|Tweet]] from [[Shaquille O'Neal]] in June 2013, which led to an appearance on the syndicated talk show ''[[The Real (TV series)|The Real]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Nathan C. Martin, [https://www.vice.com/read/the-passion-of-the-prancing-elites "The Passion of the Prancing Elites"], ''[[Vice (magazine)|Vice]]'', January 21, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018, a released documentary entitled "When The Beat Drops", chronicled the progression of J-Setting and its impact on black gay culture (primarily in [[Atlanta, Georgia|Atlanta]]).&lt;ref&gt;https://ew.com/tv/2018/08/09/when-the-beat-drops-documentary/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://instinctmagazine.com/post/gay-documentary-when-beat-drops-spotlights-bucking-scene-flourishing-us-south&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Culture of the Soviet Union}}
The '''languages of the Soviet Union''' are  hundreds of different languages and dialects from several different language groups.

In 1918, it was decreed that all nationalities in the Soviet Union had the right to education in their own language. The new orthography used the [[Cyrillic script|Cyrillic]], [[Latin alphabet|Latin]], or [[Arabic alphabet|Arabic]] alphabet, depending on geography and culture. After 1937, all languages that had received new alphabets after 1917 began using the Cyrillic alphabet. This way, it would be easier for linguistic minorities to learn to write both Russian and their native language. In 1960, the school educational laws were changed and teaching became more dominated by Russian.{{fact|date=February 2014}} 

In 1975, [[Leonid Brezhnev|Brezhnev]] said "under developed socialism, when the economies in our country have melted together in a coherent economic complex; when there is a new historical concept—the [[Soviet people]]—it is an objective growth in the Russian language's role as the language of international communications when one builds Communism, in the education of the new man! Together with one's own mother tongue one will speak fluent Russian, which the Soviet people have voluntarily accepted as a common historical heritage and contributes to a further stabilization of the political, economic and spiritual unity of the Soviet people."

==Distribution and status==

[[East Slavic languages]] ([[Russian language|Russian]], [[Belarusian language|Belarusian]] and [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]]) dominated in the European part of the Soviet Union, the [[Baltic languages]] [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]] and [[Latvian language|Latvian]], and the [[Finnic language]] [[Estonian language|Estonian]] were used next to Russian in the Baltic region, while the [[Moldovan language|Moldovan]] (the only [[Romance language]] in the union) was used in the southeast region. In the Caucasus alongside Russian there were [[Armenian language|Armenian]], [[Azerbaijani language|Azeri]] and [[Georgian language|Georgian]]. In the Russian far north, there were several minority groups who spoke different [[Uralic languages]]; most of the languages in Central Asia were Turkic with the exception of [[Tajik language|Tajik]], which is an [[Iranian languages|Iranian language]].

The USSR was a multilingual state, with over 120 languages spoken natively.{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}} Although discrimination on the basis of language was illegal under the [[Soviet Constitution]], the ''de facto'' status of these languages differed.

Although the USSR did not have ''de jure'' an official language over most of its history, until 1990,&lt;ref&gt;In early 20th century, there had been a discussion over the need to introduce Russian as the official language of [[Russian Empire]]. The dominant view among [[Bolshevik]]s at that time was that there is no need for state language. See: [[:s:ru:Нужен ли обязательный государственный язык? (Ленин)|"Нужен ли обязательный государственный язык?"]] by [[Lenin]] (1914). Staying with the Lenin's view, not state language was declared in the Soviet state.&lt;br&gt;In 1990 the Russian language was declared as the official language of [[USSR]] and the constituent republics had rights to declare additional state languages within their jurisdictions. See Article 4 of the [http://legal-ussr.narod.ru/data01/tex10935.htm Law on Languages of Nations of USSR.] {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Russian language|Russian]] was merely defined as the ''language of interethnic communication'' ({{lang-ru|язык межнационального общения}}), it assumed ''de facto'' the role of official language.&lt;ref name = "lang"&gt;Bernard Comrie, ''The Languages of the Soviet Union'', page 31, the Press Syndicate of the University of Cambridge, 1981. {{ISBN|0-521-23230-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; For its role and influence in the USSR, see [[Russification]].

On a second level were the languages of the other 14 [[Republics of the Soviet Union|Union Republics]]. In line with their ''de jure'' status in a federal state, they had a small formal role at the Union level (being e.g. present in the [[Coat of arms of the USSR]] and its [[Soviet ruble|banknotes]]) and as the main language of its republic. Their effective weight, however, varied with the republic (from strong in places like in [[Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic|Armenia]] to weak in places like in [[Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic|Byelorussia]]), or even inside it.{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}}

Of these fourteen languages, two are often considered varieties of other languages: [[Tajik language|Tajik]] of [[Persian language|Persian]], and [[Moldovan language|Moldovan]] of [[Romanian language|Romanian]]. Strongly promoted use of [[Cyrillic script|Cyrillic]] in many republics however, combined with lack of contact, led to the separate development of the literary languages. Some of the former Soviet republics, now independent states, continue to use the Cyrillic alphabet at present (such as [[Kyrgyzstan]]), while others have opted to use the [[Latin alphabet]] instead (such as [[Turkmenistan]] and [[Moldova]] &amp;ndash; although the unrecognized [[Transnistria]] officially uses the Cyrillic alphabet).

The [[Autonomous republics of the Soviet Union]] and other subdivision of the USSR lacked even this ''de jure'' autonomy, and their languages had virtually no presence at the national level (and often, not even in the urban areas of the republic itself). They were, however, present in education (although often only at lower grades).{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}}

Some smaller languages with very dwindling small communities, like [[Livonian language|Livonian]], were neglected, and weren't present either in education or in publishing.{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}}

Several languages of non-[[titular nation]]s, like [[German language|German]], [[Korean language|Korean]] or [[Polish language|Polish]], although having sizable communities in the USSR, and in some cases being present in education and in publishing, were not considered to be Soviet languages. On the other hand, [[Finnish language|Finnish]], although not generally considered a language of the USSR, was an official language of the [[Karelian Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic|Karelia]] and its predecessor [[Karelo-Finnish Soviet Socialist Republic|as a Soviet republic]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}} Also [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]] and [[Romany language|Romany]] were considered Soviet languages.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}}

In [[Finland]], [[Swedish language|Swedish]] is a '''mandatory school subject''' for [[Finnish language|Finnish]]-speaking pupils in the last four years of the [[Education in Finland|primary education]] (grades 6 to 9). This so-called ''other domestic language'' is also mandatory in [[high school]]s, [[vocational school]]s, and [[vocational university|vocational universities]]. Furthermore, all university graduates must demonstrate a certain level of proficiency in Swedish (the so-called ''public servant's Swedish''). Altogether 89% of Finnish citizens are native Finnish speakers, whereas 5.3% of the population report Swedish as their mother tongue.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20161013132323/http://www.stat.fi/tup/suoluk/suoluk_vaesto_en.html Swedophone population]&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, it is possible for Finnish citizens to report a different mother tongue for themselves at any time, and as many times as desired, by submitting a form to the Population Register Center.

According to the [[Constitution of Finland|Finnish constitution]], both [[Finnish language|Finnish]] and [[Swedish language|Swedish]] are national languages. The employees of the national government and the bilingual municipal governments are required to be able to serve citizens in Swedish. Military service is not required in the autonomous region of [[Åland]]. The official term for both mandatory Swedish and Finnish is ''the other domestic language''. However, the requirement to study Swedish is often referred to as ''pakkoruotsi'', a somewhat charged term in Finnish meaning "mandatory Swedish", or "enforced Swedish".

== Overview ==
The status of Swedish as a national language in Finland is defined by the Finnish constitution. There was migration of Swedish-speaking peasants to some Finnish coastal areas during the Middle Ages. During this period, when Finland was ruled by Sweden, Swedish language became part of the culture in the coastal areas. Swedish was also the language of the ruling class. The Finnish language was forbidden an official status alongside Swedish until the period of [[Russian Empire|Russian rule]] (1809–1917), in 1860. The autonomous [[Åland Islands]] (pop. 26,000, 95% Swedish, 5% Finnish) has only one official language, Swedish, and the speaking of Finnish between employees is forbidden in some public services.

In [[Mainland Finland]] both official languages, Finnish and Swedish, are mandatory subjects for pupils in [[Primary education|primary]] and [[secondary education|secondary]] schools. The Swedish test of the [[Abitur|Matriculation Examination]] was made voluntary in 2004, although all university graduates must demonstrate that their skills in the other official language meet the standard required of all academically educated public servants. Usually this means the completion of a so-called ''public servant's Swedish'' test. The Swedish language is also one of the main agendas of the [[Swedish People's Party (Finland)|Swedish People's Party]] that has been a minor partner in most [[Cabinet of Finland|Cabinets]] since Finland's independence, and in all Cabinets between 1972 and 2015.

Supporters of Mandatory Swedish argue that it brings Finland closer to the [[Nordic countries]], since Swedish is quite similar to, and to some extent [[Mutual intelligibility|mutually intelligible]] with, both [[Danish language|Danish]] and [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]], while Finnish belongs to the unrelated [[Finnic languages|Finnic language]] group. Supporters also say that studying Swedish makes it easier to learn other [[Germanic languages]], such as English and German. Lastly, they argue, mandatory Swedish is necessary to ensure that Swedish-speakers can interact with governmental institutions and get service, such as health care, in their own mother tongue.

== History ==
{{Main|Finland's language strife}}
The area that today is Finland was an integral part of [[Sweden proper]] from the Middle Ages to the end of the [[Finnish War]] in 1809. Swedish migrants settled in coastal areas, and the language of administration was Swedish. This prompted many Finnish-speakers to learn Swedish in hopes of improving their social status, and some switched to Swedish altogether.

As a result of the Finnish War, Sweden ceded Finland to Russia, and the Russian tsar established the autonomous [[Grand Duchy of Finland]]. Although a Governor-General was installed by the Russians as the highest authority within the Grand Duchy, much of the political system remained the same: Finland was allowed to keep its ”laws, religion and language” from the Swedish time. The tsar wanted to avoid trouble in the new territory and also used former Swedish upper class to further modernisation in Russia; Finnish was not an option at that time as official language, as the administration did not know Finnish well enough and the language was undeveloped regarding such use.

When Finland became autonomous there was a big interest in creating a new national identity. There was an immense interest in the Finnish language and Finnish culture in the mostly Swedish speaking upper class. At some point the [[Fennoman]] movement arose, that thought that the country should be a united [[nationalism|nation]], with only one language, and, as a reaction, the [[Svecoman]] movement, that was afraid that abandoning Swedish would lead to [[slavicisation]] or worse.

However, during the 1860s, under Tsar [[Alexander II of Russia|Alexander II]], it was decided that legal equality between Finnish and Swedish as languages of administration was to be gradually introduced. Thus since the late 19th century Finnish has been a co-official language of administration in Finland. Modernizations typical for the era in Europe were introduced, boosting the status of the Finnish-speaking majority: the special rights of the higher [[estates of the realm]] were abolished, a modern parliament based on [[universal suffrage]] was introduced 1907 and in 1917 Finland became independent.

In the current form, mandatory Swedish was implemented as a part of the modernisation of the [[Education in Finland|educational system]] in the 1970s. Previously, a Swedish test had been compulsory on university level and in ''oppikoulu'', a secondary school that was a prerequisite to matriculation to a university, but not in the common ''kansakoulu''. The introduction of the ''peruskoulu'' (student ages 7–15), compulsory for all children, introduced a course in Swedish compulsory to all pupils, while Swedish courses and standardized tests at higher levels remained compulsory. This was motivated by the possibility that any student could become a public official and would thus be required to know Swedish.

== Current situation ==
A compulsory introductory course to Swedish for all pupils in [[primary education]] was introduced in the 1960s as a part of modernization of the primary education system, where the nine-year school (''peruskoulu, grundskola'') was made universally compulsory. Until then there had been mandatory courses only in [[secondary education|secondary]] and [[tertiary education]]. Administrative services have, since the end of the 19th century, been offered in both domestic languages; therefore, theoretically employees should be proficient in both Finnish and Swedish. The reform was to some extent based on a political ambition to strengthen the ties with [[Western world|the Western world]] through Scandinavia, and to show that Finland was a part of the [[Nordic countries]], and not an [[Eastern Bloc]] country. It also sought to improve social mobility by ensuring that a decision on language in the early school years would not become an obstacle for applicants to the civil service.

In the [[secondary education|upper secondary general school]] all the students learn at least two languages besides their mother tongue, one of which is the other domestic language, except for people studying some other language as mother tongue (e.g. immigrants and those studying [[Sami languages|Sami]]). Finnish speakers take Swedish, and vice versa. According to [[Statistics Finland]], practically all the students take [[English language|English]], either as a compulsory or an optional language. There is also a possibility to take one or more extra foreign languages. Despite Finland being a neighbour of Russia, Russian is not taught in most schools of Finland, and only 1.5% of Finns know some Russian. The hindrances are cultural and political, as there has been relatively little cultural exchange between the Finns and Russians in the 20th century, and Finland's relations with the Soviet Union were hostile from the [[Finnish Civil War]] (1918) until [[World War II]] (1939–1944).

The arrangement of "mandatory Swedish and practically-mandatory English" has been criticized, because it reduces the diversity of the language skills of the population.&lt;ref&gt; Hult, F.M., &amp; Pietikäinen, S. (2014). Shaping discourses of multilingualism through a language ideological debate: The case of Swedish in Finland. ''Journal of Language and Politics'', 13, 1-20.&lt;/ref&gt; The EU target is to teach two foreign languages. As English is an overwhelmingly popular choice, it has been suggested by, for example, the [[Confederation of Finnish Industries]] that keeping Swedish compulsory directly prevents choosing other languages, such as Russian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=EK: Pakkoruotsista luovuttava valintamahdollisuuksien lisäämiseksi |first=Liiten |last=Marjukka |newspaper=Helsingin Sanomat |date=June 1, 2010 |url=http://www.hs.fi/paivanlehti/arkisto |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161013131532/http://www.hs.fi/paivanlehti/arkisto/ |archivedate=October 13, 2016 |deadurl=yes |df= }} {{Link language|fi}}&lt;!--Finnish--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of studies into opinions regarding mandatory Swedish have been made with various results. The big differences between studies exemplifies the problems in conducting a neutral and broad study without asking [[leading question]]s on the particular subject. Furthermore, some of the studies have been commissioned by organizations that have politically partisan views on the subject of mandatory Swedish.

Between 1990 and 2003 Taloustutkimus Oy conducted a series of more than ten surveys for [[Association of Finnish Culture and Identity|Suomalaisuuden liitto]], an organisation opposing mandatory Swedish. According to these surveys, 66–72% of Finns were "in favour of voluntary Swedish education or against mandatory Swedish education".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.suomalaisuudenliitto.fi/ruotsi.htm |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040207045737/http://www.suomalaisuudenliitto.fi/ruotsi.htm |archivedate=February 7, 2004 |title=Mandatory Swedish |df= }} {{Link language|fi}}&lt;!--Finnish--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Suomen Gallup]]'s 2003 survey concluded that while a small majority supported "compulsory second domestic language studying", it was opposed by 42% of Finns while 25% did not want both Finnish and Swedish to be official languages of Finland. This study was commissioned by [[Yle]], the Finnish publicly funded national broadcasting company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Suomen Gallupin tutkimus 2003 |url=http://www.mtv3.fi/uutiset/arkisto.shtml/arkistot/kotimaa/2003/02/157245 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090430083604/http://www.mtv3.fi/uutiset/arkisto.shtml/arkistot/kotimaa/2003/02/157245 |archivedate=April 30, 2009 |deadurl=yes |df= }}{{Link language|fi}}&lt;!--Finnish--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The question posed to those surveyed was very verbose in comparison to the Taloustutkimus surveys on the same subject. The question did not include the word "Swedish".{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}}

In 1992 a study by ''Valitut Palat'' (the Finnish edition of ''[[Reader's Digest]]'') concluded that 90 percent of the parents of third to fourth grade pupils "supported a reduction of compulsory languages" (only Finnish and Swedish are compulsory). When ''Valitut Palat'' did a new survey in 2003 it found 64% opposing mandatory Swedish, and 25% not wanting to have two official languages.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www-fi.valitutpalat.fi/lehti/tiedotteet/20000824a.html Valittujen Palojen tutkimus 2000] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928020523/http://www-fi.valitutpalat.fi/lehti/tiedotteet/20000824a.html |date=2007-09-28 }} {{Link language|fi}}&lt;!--Finnish--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

An [[International Association for the Evaluation of Educational Achievement|IEA]] study (2000) revealed that 67% of young people studying in Finnish-speaking schools wanted to make Swedish a voluntary subject. The most politically aware youths were the most critical against Swedishness in this study.&lt;ref&gt;IEA/Civic Education Study: [http://www.jyu.fi/ktl/civicsIII/SaSuKolm.htm Nuorten käsityksiä Ruotsista ja ruotsalaisuudesta] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060105175621/http://www.jyu.fi/ktl/civicsIII/SaSuKolm.htm |date=2006-01-05 }} {{Link language|fi}}&lt;!--Finnish--&gt; {{Link language|sv}}&lt;!--Swedish--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

A study conducted in 1997 by [[Folktinget]], an official consultative organisation representing Finland's Swedish-speakers, concluded that 70% of the Finnish-speaking population  considered "Swedish a vital and important part of Finnish society." This study also indicated that the most negative opinions about mandatory Swedish were found among those with academic degrees.&lt;ref&gt;Vårt land, vårt språk – kahden kielen Kansa. rapport 35. {{Link language|fi}}&lt;!--Finnish--&gt; {{Link language|sv}}&lt;!--Swedish--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

A study conducted by Taloustutkimus for Yle in 2013 indicated that 63 percent of respondents were opposed to mandatory Swedish. Further, the study indicated that among the supporters of the different political parties, only the supporters of the Swedish People's Party and the Green League favoured retaining mandatory Swedish teaching. A majority of supporters in all the other parties wanted Swedish teaching to be voluntary – the supporters of the Finns Party and the Social Democrats were most heavily in favour of making Swedish voluntary (76 and 73 percent respectively).&lt;ref name="yle.fi"/&gt;

A study conducted by [[Åbo Akademi]] in 2014 indicated that 74 percent of Finnish speaking respondents agreed with the statement "The teaching of the Swedish language should be voluntary".&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.abo.fi/pressmaterial/sprakundersokning_Finska.pdf Tutkimus kartoitti suomalaisten mielipiteitä ruotsin kielestä], Åbo Akademi 22 December 2014, accessed 22 December 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Opinions==
[[Image:Pois pakkoruotsi.svg|thumb|"Away with mandatory Swedish". &lt;br/&gt; A campaign logo against mandatory Swedish.&lt;br/&gt;The character on the logo throws away an [[Å]], a letter found in [[Swedish alphabet|Swedish]] words, but not in native [[Finnish alphabet|Finnish]].]]
In many cases, pupils have negative expectations and experiences of learning Swedish which may foster a negative attitude towards the Swedish language and culture. This behavior is claimed to hark back to the time when Finland was a part of Sweden (see [[Sweden–Finland]]), and Swedish was the language of prestige while Finnish was looked down on by the government. Negative opinions towards studying Swedish are also grounded in the fact that mandatory Swedish is taught throughout the country, even though there are few Swedish-speakers in [[mainland Finland]] outside the coastal area by the [[Baltic Sea]], and thus contact with Swedish-speakers is rare for most Finns. This fact can for some make the policy of bilingualism seem artificial, but the basic curriculum remains the same for the entire country.

According to a study published in 2002 students are interested in the Swedish language, and find it an important part of education, but they perceived Swedish being compulsory lessened their motivation&lt;ref name="lammi"&gt;Lammi, Kati. ''Kielisalkku motivoi ruotsin kielen opiskeluun.'' (''Language portfolio as a tool in promoting motivation in the study of Swedish at senior high school: student and teacher views and experiences.'') Dissertation at [[University of Jyväskylä]], 2002. [https://www.jyu.fi/ajankohtaista/arkisto/2002/11/tiedote-2007-09-18-15-40-42-566699/ Announcement in Finnish and abstract in English])&lt;!-- No such document at URL [http://info.adm.jyu.fi/main/portti/tiedotteet/2002/11/2469/show_announcement] --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; (this argument has been made very frequently in the public debate). The experiment of making the Swedish test voluntary in the matriculation examination (the completion of which is a ''de facto'' requirement for university enrollment) was declared successful and was made permanent. The percentage of students taking the Swedish test has since been constantly dropping and was 67% in 2009 (less than 50% of boys).&lt;ref&gt;[[YLE]]: [http://svenska.yle.fi/nyheter/sok.php?id=203491&amp;lookfor=&amp;sokvariant=arkivet&amp;advanced=yes&amp;antal=10 Svenskan stadigt nedåt i studentskrivningarna]&lt;/ref&gt;

There has also been a lot of criticism of the methodology used to teach Swedish and the lack of competence in many of the teachers. This has contributed to students' lack of motivation to study Swedish, and many may not learn to speak the language beyond a very basic level. Some students argue that they will never need Swedish as its utility in the Finnish job market is limited to a few fields. Moreover, the rationale of mandatory tuition in Swedish and other subjects is to give the students more of a general knowledge base, and not train them for a specific field.

In addition to the direct costs of the tuition, some argue that mandatory Swedish effectively replaces elective courses in languages such as French, German and Russian, that these persons argue are more important than Swedish in a globalized world. University students are required not only to master their selected field, but also to study at least two languages beside their mother tongue, one of which is obligatorily Swedish for Finnish-speakers. As study material is often in English, this effectively removes the free choice; the two "voluntarily chosen" languages must be Swedish and English. Despite being a neighbour of Russia, it is in practice possible to study Russian only in some schools (due to low interest or it not being offered); only 1.5% of the Finns have a good knowledge of Russian. Also very few Finns speak Estonian (which is not taught in most schools), a language of the same [[Finnic languages|Finnic language group]] as Finnish, and national language of Finland's southern neighbour [[Estonia]], although Finnish is popular in Estonia.

Sentiments toward mandatory Swedish vary. Many prominent politicians (both Finnish- and Swedish-speaking) wholeheartedly support mandatory Swedish in schools, while others oppose it. There have been numerous petitions and other similar campaigns arranged by some small but dedicated organizations to pressure the lawmakers to abolish mandatory Swedish, but to date, they have had no significant impact on the established policy. Thus, while the ongoing debate is often heated and passionate, the support for mandatory Swedish tuition remains strong enough among politicians for the government not to consider a change of policy.

Mandatory Swedish is supported by most political parties in Finland, like the [[National Coalition Party]], the [[Centre Party (Finland)|Centre Party]], the [[Social Democratic Party of Finland|Social Democrats]] and the [[Left Alliance (Finland)|Left Alliance]]. The [[Finns Party]] opposes mandatory Swedish,&lt;ref&gt;[http://arkisto.perussuomalaiset.fi/ohjelmat/getfile.php?file=1536 Finns Party electoral programme, 2011, s. 26-27] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130928083239/http://arkisto.perussuomalaiset.fi/ohjelmat/getfile.php?file=1536 |date=2013-09-28 }}, accessed 22 December 2014&lt;/ref&gt; and so does the youth wing of the National Coalition Party.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kokoomusnuoret.fi/kannanotot/2013/03/kokoomusnuoret-kannattavat-vapaaehtoista-kieltenopiskelua/ Kokoomusnuoret kannattaa vapaaehtoista kieltenopiskelua] 4 March 2013, accessed 22 December 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013 the [[Confederation of Finnish Industries]] came out in favour of making Swedish teaching voluntary. They referred to a study which indicated that in the future Swedish will be only the tenth most important language to Finnish companies, when they are considering the language skills of their potential employees.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mtv.fi/uutiset/kotimaa/artikkeli/elinkeinoelama-ajaa-pakkoruotsin-poistoa---tulevaisuudessa-tarvitaan-portugalia-/1904284 Elinkeinoelämä ajaa pakkoruotsin poistoa – tulevaisuudessa tarvitaan portugalia], MTV Uutiset 13 August 2013, accessed 23 December 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Hufvudstadsbladet]], the Confederation has subsequently changed their stance and no longer favours making Swedish voluntary, while maintaining the need for learning other languages.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hbl.fi/opinion/ledare/2014-11-14/681976/valkommen-kursandring-om-svenskan-av-ek Välkommen kursändring om svenskan av EK], Hufvudstadsbladet November 14, 2014, accessed 29 March 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

===In the Parliament of Finland===
In the 2000s the government dropped the requirement to take Swedish (or Finnish in the case of the Swedish-speaking minority) as part of the high school [[Abitur#Abitur in Finland|matriculation examination]].

In 2014 a citizens' initiative demanding an end to mandatory Swedish teaching on all levels of education was brought to the Finnish Parliament. In 2015 the MPs voted, 134 to 48, to keep mandatory Swedish. In another vote the MPs voted, 93 to 89, to demand that the government should examine, whether a regional experimentation, where another language would be taught instead of Swedish, is possible.&lt;ref&gt;[http://yle.fi/uutiset/ruotsi_sailyy_pakollisena__ita-suomeen_mahdollisuus_kielikokeiluun/7850273 Ruotsi säilyy pakollisena – Itä-Suomeen mahdollisuus kielikokeiluun?], YLE 6 March 2015, accessed 6 March 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Nanotechnology and Nanomaterials commercialized for water purification'''

Water is the most essential element to every life on this Earth. It’s a substance composed of the chemical elements hydrogen and oxygen. Water has always played a prominent role in human civilization. A sufficient supply of safe drinking water is one of the important requirement for a healthy life, but waterborne diseases plays a deadly role in creating large numbers of deaths in many parts of the world. All living things require water to grow and reproduce their own kind. Water is a tasteless and odorless liquid at room temperature. Water is the only substance that occurs naturally as a solid in the form of ice, a liquid and a gas which is in the form of water vapor. Water covers 71% of the entire Earth surface. The amount of water in this world isn't diminishing, but the demand is steadily increasing. Scientists believe that the world's population, will double by 2050. In addition to this, the amount of fresh water that is clean and safe to drink is steadily decreasing because of pollutants. So, people are in need of drinking water in its purest form. There are plenty of water purifiers available in the market which use different techniques like [[boiling]], [[filtration]], [[distillation]], [[Water chlorination|chlorination]], [[sedimentation]] and [[oxidation]]. Currently [[nanotechnology]] plays a vital role in water purification techniques. In nanotechnology, nano membranes are used with the purpose of softening the water and removal of [[Contamination|contaminants]] such as physical, biological and chemical contaminants. There are variety of techniques in nanotechnology which uses nano particles for providing safe drinking water with a high level of effectiveness. Some techniques have become commercialized.

For better water purification or treatment processes [[nanotechnology]] is preferred. Many different types of [[nanomaterials]] or nanoparticles are used in water treatment processes. Nanotechnology holds great promise in remediation, [[desalination]], filtration, [[Water purification|purification]] and water treatment.

The main features that make [[nanoparticle]]s effective for water treatment are 
* More surface area 
* Small volume
* The higher the surface area and volume, the particles become stronger, more stable and durable
* Materials may change electrical, optical, physical, chemical, or biological properties at the nano level
* Makes chemical and biological reactions easier

Nanoceram family of pleated filter cartridges are another type of sediment filters. They are designed in such a way that it could satisfy the difficulties in water treatment. When multilayer is used, it is capable of retaining 99.9999% of microbes (includes viruses, bacteria, and protozoa which are [[cryptosporidium]], [[Giardia lamblia|Giardia intestinalis]], [[Legionella|Legionella pseudomonas]], [[salmonella]], [[Escherichia coli|E.coli]], [[Mycobacterium|Mycobacteria,]] [[Aspergillus]], Endotoxins and DNA, all at flow rates hundreds of times greater than virus rated ultrafiltration membrane. The water turbidity which comes through the nanoceram media remains below 0.01NTU. Nanoceram filters use a highly electropositive filter media that absorbs particles quickly even it is too small. Each nanoceram electropositive water filter has a high capacity for particles ranging from tens of microns to few nanometers. The main advantage of this filter is that it uses a media for adsorptive removal process that has 42,000 square meters of nanofiber surface area per square meter of filter media of loading capacity. Sub-micron particles are electronegative due to the double layer effect. At a pH of 7.2, this particles are attracted due to the high zeta potential between the particle or hydrocarbon droplet and the media.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.argonide.com/nanoceram/|title=Nanoceram|last=|first=|date=2017|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Desalination]] is a viable solution for a water scarcity. But it has economical effect in society. So, we need a cost-effective alternative method for desalination. Nano H2O is next level of [[Reverse osmosis|reverse osmosis (RO)]] and membrane technology. And also it is one of the cost-effective technique. The University of California discovers a lot of these membrane technologies. In recent days Nano H2O membrane is commercially available in a market. This membrane contains 9 nanoparticles in a non-woven polyester fabric and a layer of porous [[polysulfone]] film followed by proprietary [[Nanocomposite]] material to form a quantum flux membrane. It increases membrane permeability by 50-100 % over conventional methods. This layer gives higher throughput and best salt rejection. It is folded and packed by a Nanocomposite material and prepared to 4 to 8-inch tube vessel. This technology gives higher flux than the thin film composite so that we get more water with less energy. In quantum flux membrane technology, energy consumption is 20 to 70% less than the other conventional method. For the supply of more water, this technology developed for reverse osmosis with Nano H2o membrane. It produces higher yield with low cost. So, it has high-level customer services in a global network.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.khoslaventures.com/portfolio/nanoh2o|title=NanoH2O|last=|first=|date=2017|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nanocellulose]] based renewable material has a combination of high surface area with high material strength. It is chemically inert and possesses versatile hydrophilic surface chemistry. These properties make them a most promising nanomaterial for usage membrane and filter in water purification system to remove bacterial and chemical contaminants from polluted water. It is noted that nanocellulose material has high potential in water purification technology. Different types of nanocellulose materials available for water purification system includes Cellulose [[nanocrystal]]s (CNC) and Cellulose nanofibrils (CNF). These are the rod-like nanomaterials whose size ranges from 100 to 2000&amp;nbsp;nm with the diameter of 2 to 20&amp;nbsp;nm. Those length and diameter are mostly based on origin and preparation route for the synthesis of nanocellulose. Those nanocellulose materials are used to remove organic pollutants in water such as dyes, oils and pesticides traces present in water. Presently fully biobased membrane using nanocellulose are fabricated which is used to remove metal ions such as Cu2+, Fe2+ etc, sulfates, fluorides and other organic compounds. This bio-based nanocellulose filter has more advantage to conventional filters. Nanocellulose is prepared by various methods such as sulphuric acid hydrolysis and mechanical grinding method. Water purification system is mainly based on the principle of [[Absorption (chemistry)|absorption]]. For the absorption of anionic metal species, the nanocellulose materials are functionalized with a positive charged cationic group. Similarly, for the absorption of cationic metal species, the nanocellulose material is functionalized with the negatively charged anionic group. Nanocellulose based materials have limitation in cost for large-scale production and its specificity. Presently research is based on the synthesis of hybrid nanocellulose material in combination with several other nanomaterials for the improvement of adsorption capacity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Nanocellulose|date=2017|doi=10.3390/nano7030057|pmc=5388159|pmid=28336891|volume=7|journal=Nanomaterials (Basel) | last1 = Voisin | first1 = H | last2 = Bergström | first2 = L | last3 = Liu | first3 = P | last4 = Mathew | first4 = AP | page=57}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Graphene]] is chemically dormant, mechanically sturdy, and non-permeable to gas or liquid. So, carbon plays a major role for fabrication of nanomaterials with porous nature. Graphene membranes that are formed by graphene oxide molecules or chemically converted graphene that is adhered with 2D nano mediated arrays have the ability to efficiently separate molecules in a gas or in a liquid phase. Graphene-coated nanomembranes are said to be more applicable in water treatment due to its unique properties. Graphene membranes are obtained from vacuum filtration or coating of graphene oxide solution as Graphene oxide sheets. The graphene coated nanofiltration membrane showed a higher water flux range. The graphene embedded with carbon nanotubes to serve as nanofilters is more useful for dye rejection in water effluent, removal of salt ions, and also acts as antifouling agent. Graphene nanofilter membranes possess effective [[antifouling]] agent due to its strong bond between graphene sheets and proteins. Also, graphene oxide coated nanofilter membranes helps in [[dechlorination]] of water.In addition to this, ultrathin nanofilter coated with graphene is the most potent filter that could be commercialized for water purification. Graphene oxide membranes can be used in various forms such as free, surface modified, and graphene cast in membranes in the range of micro, nano, or ultrafilters. Among which nanofilters is more efficient for water desalination due to its mechanical strength and physiochemical properties of the membrane. Moreover, there are some challenges in fabricating and applying graphene oxide based nanofilters for water desalination. The challenges include mechanical instability if nanofilters are in the form of nanosheets, cost strategy, surface flaws, and assembly.Therefore, there are more scopes in this area of research to be worked on for the betterment of the society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Porous graphene-based membranes for water purification|date=2017|doi=10.1039/C5NR09278G|pmid=27098780|volume=8|journal=Nanoscale|pages=9563–71 | last1 = Park | first1 = J | last2 = Bazylewski | first2 = P | last3 = Fanchini | first3 = G}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Carbon nanotube]]s have gained much attention for its use as [[wastewater]] and water filter. Carbon nanotube’s mechanical, electrical and chemical properties made it unique and an ideal candidate for research since 1990. Carbon nanotube combined with [[electrochemistry]] proved to be the best method for water and wastewater purification. Electrochemistry helps in reducing the fouling rate of the CNT. In case of [[Carbon nanotube|CNT]] based ultra-filters modified with electrochemistry, helps in reducing the energy by two folds comparing to an unmodified CNT based filters. Thus electrochemical carbon nanotubes have been developed due to the advanced studies in nanotechnology and electrochemistry. Here the electrochemical activity of the CNT is exploited. Very first [[electrochemical]] CNT was developed by P.J.Britto etal and the results were first recognized in 1996. An electrochemical CNT filter contains electrodes and CNT in a systematic setup such that the electrodes can attract the wastes that clog the CNT based on its charges, thus resulting in high efficiency of filtering and extension of the lifetime of the CNT in the process. The electrochemical carbon nanotubes can be easily used for removing amino group based dyes from wastewater. Chen etal first reported the absorption of dyes to the CNT walls by strong covalent bonds. These electrochemical CNT can be typically used for filtering, and recycling wastewater. Currently, there are many unannounced advancements in CNT based electrochemical sensors and these are highly under research to bring its applications into biomedical systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Electrochemical carbon nanotube filters for water and wastewater treatment|date=2017|doi=10.1021/es2000062|pmid=21388183|volume=45|journal=Environ Sci Technol|pages=3672–9 | last1 = Vecitis | first1 = CD | last2 = Schnoor | first2 = MH | last3 = Rahaman | first3 = MS | last4 = Schiffman | first4 = JD | last5 = Elimelech | first5 = M}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''OperaWorks''' is an opera training program, founded by program director Ann Baltz, and conducted in [[Northridge, Los Angeles|Northridge, California]], USA.

==Description==
[[File:Singularity.jpg|thumb|left|Performance scene from the 2009 documentary [[SING*ularity]] about OperaWorks, directed by [[Brad Mays]], produced by [[Lorenda Starfeld]]]]

OperaWorks is a training program for singers and instructors working in the field of [[classical music]]. Accepting a limited number of students selected each year from up to eight cities across the United States, the program operates from the beginning of June and runs through the end of July, annually. OperaWorks was founded in 1987&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.operaworks.com/index.php?q=about|title=OperaWorks – About Us|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; by classical pianist Ann Baltz as a response to what she saw as the myopic tendencies of conventional operatic training. Baltz envisioned a new approach to the training of vocalists, in which the "total instrument" would be addressed, not just the voice itself. Over the years, her program has expanded to include instruction in [[Motion (physics)|movement]], [[Yoga]], [[acting]], [[Creative visualization|visualization]], [[conducting]], [[improvisation]] and the [[Alexander technique]], as well as [[career management]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://operaworks.org/media|title=Media|website=OperaWorks}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.anderson.edu/academics/music/classical-improv/&lt;/ref&gt;

Borrowing to some degree from teaching techniques long utilized in contemporary theatrical training, OperaWorks strives to free the individual vocal artist in such a manner that the physical conventions and artifice of [[opera]] performance can fall away, hopefully revealing something altogether truer to life itself. Recognizing the uniqueness of each individual artist, OperaWorks endeavors to develop singers from the inside out, thus enabling them to trust their own instincts – musically, emotionally, dramatically.

In 2006, Baltz invited [[independent film|independent]] [[auteur|filmmaker]] [[Brad Mays]] to spend an entire summer filming the various classes and events at OperaWorks. The results are to be seen in the documentary feature film ''[[SING*ularity]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{imdb title|0831324|Sing*ularity}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pokemones dressed similarly to other urban tribes, such as [[otaku]] and [[emo]], but they were not followers of [[anime]] like the former, nor shared the musical tastes of the latter.&lt;ref name="afp"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from borrowing aspects from the emo, like the sideswept [[fringe (hair)|bangs]], the Pokemones also shared some aspects typical to the [[Punk (subculture)|punk]] and the local "hardcore" subculture. Pokemones were livelier, more extroverted than the emo and otaku stereotypes. Most Pokemones were teens. During parties they danced to [[reggaeton]] music, while kissing and groping with as many people (male or female) as they could, which they called ''poncear''.&lt;ref name="nytimes"/&gt; They made extensive use of the [[Internet]], trading photos of themselves on image-sharing site [[Fotolog]] and communicating through [[MSN Messenger]].&lt;ref name="nytimes"/&gt;&lt;ref name="afp"/&gt;

Pokemones were usually from the Chilean middle and lower class. They were frequently juxtaposed against another group, the so-called ''peloláis'', well-to-do girls with long, straight, fairer hair from private, Catholic schools.&lt;ref name="reuters"&gt;{{cite web

In January 2008, Internet messages surfaced urging violence against Pokemones (mainly because of borrowing aspects from other subcultures, such as emo hair, [[hip-hop]] clothes, and for using the [[Crip Walk|c-walk]]).{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} People belonging to the subculture increasingly began to be attacked outside discos and pubs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

A '''pot boiler ''' is a heated stone used to heat water.

== In Archaeology ==
In an [[Archaeology|archaeological]] / [[Anthropology|anthropological]] context, the term refers to a stone used to move [[heat]] from a fire to a [[Cookware and bakeware|vessel]] to raise the temperature of water in the vessel, including for cooking. The stone is heated in a fire or in embers. When hot enough, the stone is transferred into a vessel of water to heat the contents. The vessel may be metal (though this is uncommon, metal normally being tough enough to take direct heat from a fire) or pottery which is not of good enough quality to be directly exposed to the heat of the fire.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=5al4AAAAIAAJ&amp;q=pot+boiler+stone&amp;dq=pot+boiler+stone&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjeqJyLo8HaAhWOyKQKHYpSBbgQ6AEISzAG|title=Folk-memory: or, The continuity of British archaeology|last=Johnson|first=Walter|date=1908|publisher=Clarendon Press|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=112|language=en|quote=The hearth fire has handed down one relic of antiquity, the ' pot-boiler '. The pot-boiler was a roughly rounded stone, usually flint, which was made red hot and then flung into the water contained in the primitive cauldron or in a puddled hollow in the soil. By this means flesh was boiled, however inefficiently. Or, again, the meat was grilled or baked over the heated stones. The use of the pot-boiler for heating water was continued until late in the historic period.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a pre-pottery context, the heating can be done by lining a pit with leather, leaves or clay, and then putting in the water followed by pot boilers directly into the vessel.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.futuremuseum.co.uk/collections/people/lives-in-key-periods/archaeology/mesolithic/stone-objects/pot-boiler-stone.aspx|title=Pot Boiler stone , Mesolithic|last=|first=|date=|website=www.futuremuseum.co.uk Dumfries Museum &amp; Camera Obscura|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ukge.com/en-gb/Neolithic-Stone-Age-Pot-Boilers__p-2798.aspx|title=Neolithic (Stone Age) Pot Boilers {{!}} UKGE|website=www.ukge.com|language=en|access-date=2018-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The repeated exposure to the heat of the fire followed typically by rapid chilling in water leads to great thermal stress on the stone's fabric due to the [[thermal expansion]] and contraction. This typically leads to partial glazing of the stone's surface and a fine network of cracks on the stone's surface (often described as "[[crazing]]"). Eventually the stone shatters. Individual fragments may be re-used until it becomes infeasible to manipulate the stone into and out of the fire, at which point the fragments are discarded and a new pot boiler (or many new ones) are acquired. Often the broken pot boilers are discarded into middens or domestic waste deposits, which on long-established sites can amount to many tonnes of material.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://finds.org.uk/database/artefacts/record/id/638066|title=Record ID: FAKL-19038D - BRONZE AGE pot boiler|website=The Portable Antiquities Scheme|language=en|access-date=2018-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reuse as building material is not impossible, but the typical small size of the fragments hinders this use.

=== Identification ===
Surface "crazing" is not restricted to pot boilers - [[hearth|hearth stones]] and the surrounds of fireplaces may also show the same structure. However, since a pot boiler needs to be manipulated into and out of the fire (typically in anthropological observations, using sticks of green wood) at arm's length, they start off weighing up to several kilogrammes, and shrink by fragmentation ; hearth stones and chimney liners are typically larger.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1919">{{DISPLAYTITLE:''Publishers Weekly'' lists of bestselling novels in the United States}}
This is a list of '''lists of [[Bestseller|bestselling]] novels in the [[United States]]''' as determined by ''[[Publishers Weekly]]''. The list features the most popular novels of each year from [[1895 in literature|1895]] through [[2010 in literature|2010]].

The standards set for inclusion in the lists - which, for example, led to the exclusion of the [[novel]]s in the ''[[Harry Potter]]'' series from the [[List of bestselling novels in the United States in the 1990s|lists for the 1990s]] and [[List of bestselling novels in the United States in the 2000s|2000s]] - are currently unknown.

For many years, the list was maintained by Alice Payne Hackett, who also published a decennial series which summarized and commented on the best sellers of the previous decade. Her ''Seventy Years of Bestsellers 1895-1965'' was published in 1970.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1964&amp;dat=19700412&amp;id=KH8yAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=q7UFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2651,5108490 “The Games People Play in the World of Books”], ''The Palm Beach Post'', April 12, 1970&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Pusharo.jpg|thumb|Detail of Pusharo petroglyphs]]
The '''Petroglyphs of Pusharo''' constitute a unique and extensive ancient rock art site in southeast [[Peru]]'s [[Manú National Park]], a [[jungle]]d expanse that still contains unexplored and little known areas, and for which an official government permit is required for entry.

==Discovery==
It appears that a rubber tapper on an Indian raid in 1909 may have been the first non-native to encounter the petroglyphs, with the next visit having been made by a Dominican missionary, Vicente Cenitagoya, in 1921.  A smattering of adventurers began to arrive at the site in the 1950s, and in 1969 the site was visited by the Peruvian physician/explorer Dr. [[Carlos Neuenschwander Landa]] (who would return in later years accompanied by Peruvian explorer, Sr. Santiago Yábar). In 1970 another peripatetic Dominican, Padre Adolfo Torrealba, reached the site, followed by Japanese explorer Yoshiharo Sekino, and the French-Peruvian explorers Herbert and Nicole Cartagena in 1978.  Two years later came the Peruvian archaeologist [[Federico Kauffmann Doig]]. In 1991 the party of North American explorer [[Gregory Deyermenjian]], including Peruvian explorer Paulino Mamani and the previously mentioned Santiago Yábar, arrived at Pusharo.  The site has since been visited and studied by rock art scholar Rainer Hostnig.

In 2008, it was the subject of a documentary-trek filmed for the [[BBC]] television series ''[[Extreme Dreams With Ben Fogle|Extreme Dreams]]'' presented by [[Ben Fogle]].

==Description==
The site is made up of an array of deeply incised rock carvings that cover up to a height of 9 feet, a perpendicular rock face that is over 100 feet long and 75 feet high.  Its location is on the south shore of the [[Río Palatoa]] (designated on some maps at this location as the Porotoa, and known by others as the [[Palatoa Chico]]).  The [[petroglyphs]] are thought by some researchers to be purely pan-Amazonian in origin, and of mistico-religious or shamanic significance to those Amerindians of past centuries who must have been their creators.  Others believe that there is an Incan component that is now coming to light, and that the glyphs constitute parts of a map.  Definitive word on the meaning of Pusharo's glyphs must wait until further research is conducted and completed.  The glyphs contain elements such as heart-shaped faces, some with double borders, spirals, zigzags, suns, "curlicue X's" and others that defy verbal description.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8696">'''Recreational drug tourism''' is travel for the purpose of obtaining or using drugs for recreational use that are unavailable, illegal or very expensive in one's home jurisdiction. A drug tourist may cross a national border to obtain a drug that is not sold in one's home country, or to obtain an [[illegal drug]] that is more available in the visited destination. A drug tourist may also cross a sub-national border (from one province/county/state to another) in order to purchase [[alcoholic beverage|alcohol]] or [[tobacco]] more easily, or at a lower price due to tax laws or other regulations.

Empirical studies show that drug tourism is heterogeneous and might involve either the pursuit of mere pleasure and escapism or a quest for profound and meaningful experiences through the consumption of drugs.

Drug tourism has many legal implications, and persons engaging in it sometimes risk prosecution for [[drug smuggling]] or other drug-related charges in their home jurisdictions or in the jurisdictions they are visiting, especially if they bring their purchases home rather than using them abroad. The act of traveling for the purpose of buying or using drugs is itself a criminal offense in some jurisdictions.

== By country/region ==

=== Asia/Middle East ===
[[Malana, Himachal Pradesh| Malana]], [[India]] is famous for its production of [[Charas|Indian hashish]], attracting foreign tourists.  Indian pharmacies also sell many generic drugs at prices far lower than in the US.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2015/10/24/specialty-drug-classes-that-are-costing-consumers.aspx | title=Specialty Drug Classes That Are Costing Consumers an Arm and a Leg  | work=[[The Motley Fool]] | date=2015-10-24 | accessdate=2015-10-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Europe ===
[[File:CannabisCoffeeShopAmsterdam.jpg|thumb|A sign of a cannabis coffee shop in [[Amsterdam]]]]
In [[Europe]], the Netherlands, and especially the Dutch capital, [[Amsterdam]], is a popular destination for drug tourists, due to the liberal attitude of the Dutch toward [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] use and possession. Drug tourism thrives because legislation controlling the sale, possession, and use of drugs varies dramatically from one jurisdiction to another.

[[File:Drugs warning Amsterdam November-2014(3).JPG|thumb|Warning sign in Amsterdam after 3 tourists died after taking white heroin that was sold as cocaine]]
In May 2011 the Dutch government announced that tourists would to be banned from Dutch coffeeshops, starting in the southern provinces at the end of 2011,&lt;ref&gt;[http://uk.news.yahoo.com/tourists-face-weed-ban-dutch-coffee-shops-023932774.html Tourists Face Weed Ban In Dutch Coffee Shops, [[Sky News]], May 28, 2011 ]&lt;/ref&gt; and the rest of the country by 2012,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nydailynews.com/life-style/health/tourists-banned-dutch-cannabis-cafes-article-1.977216 Tourists to be banned from Dutch cannabis cafes, [[nydailynews]], November 14, 2011 ],&lt;/ref&gt; though this was never made into law and thus coffeeshops throughout the Netherlands continue remain open to tourists as of May 2016.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.coffeeshop.tours/ Many coffeeshops in the netherlands] are still open to tourists. Find one you like.&lt;/ref&gt; On 25 November 2014 two British tourists aged 20 and 21 died in a hotel room in Amsterdam, after snorting [[2014 Amsterdam drug deaths|white heroin that was sold as cocaine]] by a street dealer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://m.bbc.co.uk/newsbeat/30254912 Drugs expert claims rogue dealer caused Amsterdam deaths] BBC.co.uk&lt;/ref&gt; The bodies were found less than a month after another British tourist died in similar circumstances. At least 17 other people have had medical treatment after taking the white heroin.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/nov/28/british-tourists-died-white-heroin-amsterdam-cocaine-shaun-brotherston-bradley-price British tourists who died ‘after snorting white heroin’ named] The Guardian&lt;/ref&gt;

=== North America ===
Drug tourism from the [[United States]] occurs in many contexts. Americans between the ages of 18 and 21 may cross the border into [[Canada]] or [[Mexico]] to purchase alcohol. Conversely, many Canadians travel to the United States to purchase alcohol at lower prices due to high taxes levied on alcohol in Canada. Americans living in [[Dry county|dry counties]] also frequently cross county or state lines to purchase alcohol.

Many Americans cross state lines to purchase [[cigarette]]s, crossing from a jurisdiction with very high cigarette taxes to a jurisdiction (such as another state or an [[Native American reservation|Indian nation]]) with lower cigarette taxes. This occurs particularly in the [[Northeastern United States]], where states levy [[Cigarette taxes in the United States|among the highest tobacco taxes in the nation]].

====United States====
{{main|Cannabis in the United States}}
Since the legalization of [[Cannabis]] in  [[Alaska Measure 2 (2014)|Alaska]], [[Adult Use of Marijuana Act|California]], [[Colorado Amendment 64|Colorado]], [[Maine Question 1, 2016|Maine]], [[Cannabis in Massachusetts|Massachusetts]], [[Michigan Regulation and Taxation of Marihuana Act|Michigan]], [[Cannabis in Nevada|Nevada]], [[Oregon Ballot Measure 91 (2014)|Oregon]], [[Cannabis in Vermont|Vermont]], [[Washington Initiative 502|Washington state]] and [[Initiative 71|Washington D.C]],  many drug tourists from states and countries where cannabis is illegal travel to these states to purchase cannabis and cannabis products.

====Mexico====
The sale and possession of [[psilocin]] and [[psilocybin]] are prohibited under the federal [[health law]] of 1984. However, this prohibition is mostly unenforced against indigenous users of [[psilocybin mushroom]]s. As a result, the towns of [[Huautla de Jiménez]] and [[San José del Pacífico]] (both in the southern state of [[Oaxaca]]) have gained notoriety for their association with magic mushrooms, and constitute a safe haven even for non-indigenous users.

=== South America ===
In [[South America]], some tourists are attracted to [[Amazon basin]] villages to try a local liquid called [[ayahuasca]] which is a mixture of [[Psychedelic drug|psychedelic]] plants that is used in traditional ceremonies. Similarly, tourists in [[Peru]] try [[hallucinogen]]ic [[cactus]] called [[Echinopsis pachanoi|San Pedro]] which originally has been used by local tribes.

=== Oceania ===
In [[Australia]], the [[Australian Capital Territory]] and [[South Australia]] have a more liberal approach to cannabis use, promoting interstate drug tourism, particularly from [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] and [[New South Wales]]. In addition, some areas of northern New South Wales have a liberal recreational drug culture, particularly areas around [[Nimbin, New South Wales|Nimbin]] where the annual [[MardiGrass]] festival is held. Discrete Local Guides may also be a source of plants

In [[cultural anthropology]] and [[sociology]], '''redistribution''' refers to a system of economic exchange involving the  centralized collection of goods from members of a group followed by the redivision of those goods among those members. It is a form of [[Reciprocity (cultural anthropology)|reciprocity]]. Redistribution differs from simple reciprocity, which is a dyadic back-and-forth exchange between two parties. Redistribution, in contrast, consists of pooling, a system of reciprocities. It is a ''within'' group relationship, whereas reciprocity is a ''between'' relationship. Pooling establishes a centre, whereas reciprocity inevitably establishes two distinct parties with their own interests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sahlins|first=Marshall|title=Stone Age Economics|year=1972|publisher=Aldine de Gruyter|location=New York|page=188}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the most basic form of pooling is that of food within the family, it is also the basis for sustained community efforts under a political leader.

Sahlins argues that generalized reciprocity within families by elders may be a "starting mechanism" for more general hierarchy, by placing many in the giver's debt. This leads to the question, "when does reciprocity give way to redistribution."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sahlins|first=Marshall|title=Stone Age Economics|year=1972|publisher=Aldine de Gruyter|location=New York|page=209}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sahlins argues that chiefly redistribution is not different in principle and nothing but a highly organized form of kinship-rank reciprocity. Others, such as French [[Political economy in anthropology|Marxist anthropologist]] [[Claude Meillassoux]], used the development of ranked kin redistribution from generalized reciprocity as the basis for a lineage mode of production found in western African chiefdoms and kingdoms.
An elaborate example of this in a non-market society is the [[potlatch]], where large amounts of personal resources are ceremonially given away to others in the community according to social status, with the tacit expectation that other members of the community would themselves give away large amounts of their own property in the future.&lt;ref&gt;http://anthro.palomar.edu/tutorials/cglossary.htm#potlatch&lt;/ref&gt;

Bähre argued that redistribution is a central mechanism in capitalist economies. In South Africa, many find themselves in a [[post-Fordism|post-Fordist economy]] that is characterised by redistribution through the state (development aid, welfare), through markets (for example commercial insurance) and through religious institutions (neo-Pentecostal churches).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bähre|first=Erik|year=2011|title=Liberation and Redistribution: Social Grants, Commercial Insurance, and Religious Riches in South Africa|url=https://www.erikbaehre.nl/sites/www.erikbaehre.nl/files/publications/cssh_53_2_371-392.pdf|journal=Comparative Studies in Society and History|volume=53 |issue=2|pages=371–392|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In modern [[mixed economy|mixed market economies]], the central form of redistribution is facilitated through [[taxation]] by the [[State (polity)|state]]. [[Redistribution of income and wealth|Redistribution of property]] therefore occurs where properties are allocated back to individuals or groups within society either through the provision of [[public services]] or directly through [[welfare benefits]].

'''''Revolutionary Road''''' (released December 31, 1961) is author [[Richard Yates (novelist)|Richard Yates]]'s [[debut novel]]. It was a finalist for the [[National Book Award]] in 1962 along with ''[[Catch-22]]'' and ''[[The Moviegoer]]''. When published by Atlantic-Little, Brown in [[1961 in literature|1961]], it received critical acclaim, and ''[[The New York Times]]'' reviewed it as "beautifully crafted... a remarkable and deeply troubling book."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=American beauty (Circa 1955) | series=New York Times Book Review | last=Ford | first=Richard |  work=[[The New York Times]] | date=April 9, 2000 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/04/09/books/essay-american-beauty-circa-1955.html | accessdate=June 14, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, the novel was chosen by ''[[Time (magazine)|TIME]]'' as one of the [[Time's List of the 100 Best Novels|100 best English-language novels]] from 1923 to the present.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/2005/100books/the_complete_list.html "All-Time 100 Novels"], ''Time'', 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

When [[DeWitt Henry]] and Geoffrey Clark interviewed Yates for the Winter [[1972 in literature|1972]] issue of ''[[Ploughshares]]'', Yates detailed the title's subtext:

{{quote|I think I meant it more as an indictment of American life in the 1950s. Because during the Fifties there was a general lust for conformity all over this country, by no means only in the suburbs—a kind of blind, desperate clinging to safety and security at any price.&lt;ref&gt;Henry, DeWitt and Clark, Geoffrey. "An Interview with Richard Yates," ''Ploughshares'', Winter 1972.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

A film adaptation, starring [[Leonardo DiCaprio]], [[Kate Winslet]], and [[Kathy Bates]], directed by [[Sam Mendes]] and written by [[Justin Haythe]], was released in 2008.

== Plot summary ==
Set in 1955, the novel focuses on the hopes and aspirations of Frank and April Wheeler, self-assured [[Connecticut]] suburbanites who see themselves as very different from their neighbors in the Revolutionary Hill Estates.  In the opening scene, April stars in an embarrassingly bad amateur dramatic production of ''[[The Petrified Forest]]'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;She was working alone, and visibly weakening with every line. Before the end of the first act the audience could tell as well as the Players that she’d lost her grip, and soon they were all embarrassed for her. She had begun to alternate between false theatrical gestures and a white-knuckled immobility; she was carrying her shoulders high and square, and despite her heavy make-up you could see the warmth of humiliation rising in her face and neck.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

After the performance, Frank and April have a fight on the side of the highway, and Frank later begins an affair with his office colleague Maureen Grube.

Seeking to break out of their suburban rut (and consequently blaming herself for all of Frank's "problems"), April convinces Frank they should move to Paris, where she will work and support him while he realizes his vague ambition to be something other than an office worker. The promise of France brings the two together in love and excitement again, and Frank seemingly ends his relationship with Maureen. While April sees the emigration as an opportunity to escape their dull environment, Frank's plans are more driven by vanity of his own intelligence, which April panders to. When the dull and prim neighbor Mrs. Givings begins bringing her "insane" son John around to the Wheelers' house for regular lunches, John's honest and erratic condemnation of his mother's suburban lifestyle strikes a chord with the Wheelers, particularly Frank.

Their plans to leave the United States begin to crumble when April conceives their third child, and Frank begins to identify with his mundane job when the prospect of a promotion arises. After arguing over the possibility of aborting the child, Frank tries to manipulate April into seeking psychiatric help for her troubled childhood. April, overwhelmed by the outcome of the situation, suffers something of an identity crisis and sleeps with her neighbor Shep Campbell, while Frank resurrects his relationship with Maureen. April attempts to [[Backyard Abortion|self-abort]] her child, and in doing so is rushed to the hospital and dies from blood loss. Frank, scarred by the ordeal and feeling deep guilt over the outcome, is left a hollow shell of a man. He and his children spent time living with their uncle, hence mirroring the youth of their mother.&lt;ref&gt;John Mullan,[https://www.theguardian.com/books/2004/sep/18/featuresreviews.guardianreview26 "Left unsaid"], ''[[The Guardian]]'', September 18, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Themes==
In the October 1999 issue of the ''[[Boston Review]]'',  Yates was quoted on his central theme: "If my work has a theme, I suspect it is a simple one: that most human beings are inescapably alone, and therein lies their tragedy." The Wheelers' frustrations and yearnings for something better represent the tattered remnants of the [[American Dream]].

== Literary significance ==
[[Stewart O'Nan]] probed the neglect of Yates in "The Lost World of Richard Yates: How the Great Writer of the Age of Anxiety Disappeared from Print".&lt;ref&gt;[[Stewart O'Nan]]. [http://bostonreview.net/BR24.5/onan.html "The Lost World of Richard Yates: How the Great Writer of the Age of Anxiety Disappeared from Print"]. ''[[Boston Review]]'', October/November 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
[[William Styron]], who once gave a reading of the novel's opening chapter at [[Boston University]], called ''Revolutionary Road'' "a deft, ironic, beautiful novel that deserves to be a classic."

[[Kurt Vonnegut]] called it "''[[The Great Gatsby]]'' of my time... one of the best books by a member of my generation."

[[Tennessee Williams]] also praised the book: "Here is more than fine writing; here is what, added to fine writing, makes a book come immediately, intensely and brilliantly alive. If more is needed to make a masterpiece in modern American fiction, I am sure I don't know what it is."

The '''Royal Danish Academy of Sciences and Letters''' ({{lang-da|Kongelige Danske Videnskabernes Selskab}}) is a Danish non-governmental science [[Academy]], founded in 1742 for the advancement of science in Denmark. It is based in the [[Carlsberg Foundation]]'s building at the corner of [[H. C. Andersens Boulevard]] and [[Dantes Plads]] in central [[Copenhagen]].

== History ==
[[File:PS Krøyer - Videnskabernes Selskab.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Krøyer's painting in the Old Meeting Hall.]]
The Society was founded on [[1742 in Denmark|13 November 1742]] by permission of King [[Christian VI of Denmark|Christian VI]], as a historical [[Collegium (disambiguation)|Collegium]] Antiquitatum. It was founded by secretary of state, Count [[Johan Ludvig Holstein]] and the history professor [[Hans Gram (historian)|Hans Gram]].

== Building ==
[[File:Carlsbergfondet.JPG|thumb|200px|The building on H.C. Andersens Boulevard.]] 
The building at 35 [[H. C. Andersens Boulevard]] was designed by [[Vilhelm Petersen]] in a [[Neoclassical architecture|Neoclassical]] style.

The Carlsberg Foundation is based in the ground floor while the Royal Academy has the three upper floors. First floor contains the Old Meeting Hall, where the Academy hold their meetings. It is decorated with a large oil painting by [[Peder Severin Krøyer]] depicting ''A meeting in the Royal Scientific Society''. There is also a library and rooms for researchers. Second floor contain the Academy's secretariate  and archives as the President's, General Secretary's and Editor's offices.Third floor now contains New Meeting Room. It was created in the former attic and book storage in connection with an adaption of the building in 1976. Since 2009, it has access to a roof terrace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.carlsbergfondet.dk/da/Kontakt/Bygningen.aspx|title=Bygningen|language=Danish|publisher=Carlsberg Foundation|accessdate=2013-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Members==
Members of the Academy are researching, lecturing and publishing in nearly all fields of science. The Academy has approximately 250 national and 260 foreign members. In 2011 the division [[The Young Academy]] was added, which currently counts 34 young researchers as members&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.youngacademy.dk/da/Medlemmer.aspx|title=DUA|language=Danish|publisher=DUA|accessdate=2017-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

'''Simone Lucie Ernestine Marie Bertrand de Beauvoir''' ({{IPAc-en|d|ə|_|ˈ|b|oʊ|ˌ|v|w|ɑr}};&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/us/de_beauvoir,_simone|title=de Beauvoir, Simone|work=[[Oxford American Dictionary]]|access-date=9 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{IPA-fr|simɔn də bovwaʁ|lang|Fr-Simone de Beauvoir.ogg}}; 9 January 1908 – 14 April 1986) was a French writer, intellectual, [[Existentialism|existentialist philosopher]], political activist, [[feminist]] and [[social theorist]]. Though she did not consider herself a philosopher, she had a significant influence on both [[feminist existentialism]] and [[feminist theory]].&lt;ref name="plato.stanford"&gt;Bergoffen, Debra, "Simone de Beauvoir", ''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' (Fall 2010 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), URL = &lt;http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2010/entries/beauvoir/&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

De Beauvoir wrote novels, essays, biographies, autobiography and [[monograph]]s on philosophy, politics and social issues. She was known for her 1949 treatise ''[[The Second Sex]]'', a detailed analysis of women's oppression and a foundational tract of contemporary [[feminism]]; and for her novels, including ''[[She Came to Stay]]'' and ''[[The Mandarins]]''. She was also known for her lifelong relationship with French philosopher [[Jean-Paul Sartre]].

==Early years==
===Family===
Simone de Beauvoir was born in Paris on 9 January 1908. Her parents were Georges Bertrand de Beauvoir, a legal secretary who once aspired to be an actor,&lt;ref name = "IEP Biography"&gt;Mussett, Shannon. [http://www.iep.utm.edu/beauvoir/#H1 Simone de Beauvoir Biography on the Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy]. Retrieved 11 April 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; and Françoise de Beauvoir (née Brasseur), a wealthy banker's daughter and devout Catholic. Simone's sister, [[Hélène de Beauvoir|Hélène]], was born two years later. The family struggled to maintain their bourgeois status after losing much of their fortune shortly after [[World War I]], and Françoise insisted that the two daughters be sent to a prestigious convent school. De Beauvoir herself was deeply religious as a child, at one point intending to become a nun. She lost her faith in her early teens and remained an [[atheism|atheist]] for the rest of her life.&lt;ref name = Thurman&gt;Thurman, Judith. [https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/30/books/excerpt-introduction-second-sex.html Introduction to Simone de Beauvoir’s ''The Second Sex'']. Excerpt published in ''The New York Times'' 27 May 2010. Retrieved 11 April 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Education===
De Beauvoir was intellectually precocious, fuelled by her father's encouragement; he reportedly would boast, "Simone thinks like a man!"&lt;ref&gt;Bair, p. 60&lt;/ref&gt; Because of her family's straitened circumstances, de Beauvoir could no longer rely on her [[dowry]], and like other middle-class girls of her age, her marriage opportunities were put at risk. De Beauvoir took this opportunity to do what she always wanted to do while also taking steps to earn a living for herself.&lt;ref name="oxfordreference.com"&gt;Roberts, Mary Louise. "Beauvoir, Simone de." In ''The Oxford Encyclopedia of Women in World History''. Oxford University Press, 2008. [http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780195148909.001.0001/acref-9780195148909-e-90 Source]. Retrieved 3 February 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

After passing baccalaureate exams in mathematics and philosophy in 1925, she studied mathematics at the [[Institut Catholique de Paris]] and literature/languages at the {{Interlanguage link multi|Institut Sainte-Marie|fr}}. She then studied philosophy at the [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]] and after completing her degree in 1928, she wrote her ''{{Interlanguage link multi|diplôme d'études supérieures|fr}}'' (roughly equivalent to an [[Master of Arts|MA]] thesis) on [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]] for [[Léon Brunschvicg]] (the topic was "Le concept chez Leibniz" ["The Concept in Leibniz"]).&lt;ref&gt;Margaret A. Simons (ed.), ''Feminist Interpretations of Simone de Beauvoir'', Penn State Press, Nov 1, 2010, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; De Beauvoir was only the ninth woman to have received a degree from the Sorbonne at the time, due to the fact that French women had only recently been allowed to join higher education.&lt;ref name="oxfordreference.com"/&gt;

De Beauvoir first worked with [[Maurice Merleau-Ponty]] and [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]], when all three completed their practice teaching requirements at the same secondary school. Although not officially enrolled, she sat in on courses at the [[École Normale Supérieure]] in preparation for the ''[[agrégation]]'' in philosophy, a highly competitive postgraduate examination which serves as a national ranking of students. It was while studying for the ''agrégation'' that she met ''École Normale'' students [[Jean-Paul Sartre]], [[Paul Nizan]], and [[René Maheu]] (who gave her the lasting nickname "Castor", or beaver).&lt;ref name = "IEP Biography" /&gt;  The jury for the ''agrégation'' narrowly awarded Sartre first place instead of de Beauvoir, who placed second and, at age 21, was the youngest person ever to pass the exam.&lt;ref&gt;Menand, Louis. [http://www.newYorker.com/archive/2005/09/26/050926crbo_books?currentPage=all "Stand By Your Man"]. ''The New Yorker'', 26 September 2005. Retrieved 11 May 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing of her youth in ''Memoirs of a Dutiful Daughter'' she said:
"...my father's individualism and pagan ethical standards were in complete contrast to the rigidly moral conventionalism of my mother's teaching. This disequilibrium, which made my life a kind of endless disputation, is the main reason why I became an intellectual."&lt;ref&gt;''Memoirs of a Dutiful Daughter'', Book One&lt;/ref&gt;

==Middle years==
[[File:Sartre and de Beauvoir at Balzac Memorial.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Jean-Paul Sartre and Simone de Beauvoir at the Balzac Memorial]]
From 1929 to 1943, de Beauvoir taught at the [[lycée]] level until she could support herself solely on the earnings of her writings. She taught at the {{Interlanguage link multi|Lycée Montgrand|fr}} ([[Marseille]]), the {{Interlanguage link multi|Lycée Jeanne-d'Arc (Rouen)|fr}}, the {{Interlanguage link multi|Lycée Molière (Paris)|fr}} (1936–39).&lt;ref&gt;Kelly Oliver (ed.), ''French Feminism Reader'', Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers, 2000, p. 1; ''Bulletin 2006 de l'Association amicale des anciens et anciennes élèves du lycée Molière'', 2006, p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt;

During October 1929, [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] and de Beauvoir became a couple and, after they were confronted by her father, Sartre asked her to marry him.&lt;ref&gt;Bair, pp. 155–56&lt;/ref&gt; One day while they were sitting on a bench outside the Louvre, he said, "Let's sign a two-year lease".&lt;ref&gt;Bair, p. 157&lt;/ref&gt; Near the end of her life, de Beauvoir said, "Marriage was impossible. I had no dowry." So they entered a lifelong relationship.&lt;ref&gt;Bair, p. 156&lt;/ref&gt;{{ref}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2005/jun/10/gender.politicsphilosophyandsociety |location=London |work=The Guardian  | first=Lisa | last=Appignanesi | title=Our relationship was the greatest achievement of my life | date=10 June 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sartre and de Beauvoir always read each other's work. Debate continues about the extent to which they influenced each other in their existentialist works, such as Sartre's ''[[Being and Nothingness]]'' and de Beauvoir's ''She Came to Stay'' and "Phenomenology and Intent". However, recent studies of de Beauvoir's work focus on influences other than Sartre, including [[G. W. F. Hegel|Hegel]] and Leibniz.&lt;ref name="plato.stanford" /&gt; The [[Neo-Hegelianism|Neo-Hegelian]] revival led by [[Alexandre Kojève]] and [[Jean Hyppolite]] in the 1930s inspired a whole generation of French thinkers, including Beauvoir and Sartre, to discover Hegel's ''[[Phenomenology of Spirit]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Ursula Tidd, ''Simone de Beauvoir'', Psychology Press, p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nancy Bauer, ''Simone de Beauvoir: Philosophy, and Feminism'', Columbia University Press, 2012, p. 86.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
[[File:Nelson Algren NYWTS.jpg|thumb|left|upright|alt=Waist high portrait of middle aged man reading|Algren in 1956]]
Beginning in 1929, de Beauvoir and Jean-Paul Sartre were partners for fifty-one years until his death in 1980.&lt;ref&gt;Seymour-Jones 2008, p. Back cover&lt;/ref&gt; De Beauvoir chose never to marry or set up a joint household and she never had children. This gave her the time to advance her education and engage in political causes, to write and teach, and to have lovers.&lt;ref name=Schneir&gt;{{cite book|author=Schneir, Miriam|title=Feminism in Our Time|year=1994|publisher=Vintage Books|page=5|isbn=0-679-74508-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Perhaps her most famous lover was American author [[Nelson Algren]] whom she met in Chicago in 1947, and to whom she wrote across the Atlantic as "my beloved husband."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1998-09-27/entertainment/9809270154_1_beauvoir-novelist-nelson-algren-simone|title=Simone de Beauvoir's Love Letters to Nelson Algren|last=|first=|date=|work=Chicago Tribune|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Algren won the National Book Award for ''[[The Man with the Golden Arm (novel)|The Man with the Golden Arm]]'' in 1950, and in 1954, de Beauvoir won France's most prestigious literary prize for ''[[The Mandarins]]'' in which Algren is the character Lewis Brogan.

De Beauvoir was bisexual and her relationships with young women were controversial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Rodgers, Nigel|author-link1=Nigel Rodgers|author2=Thompson, Mel|author-link2=Mel Thompson|title=Philosophers Behaving Badly|year=2004|publisher=London: [[Peter Owen Publishers]]|isbn=072061368X|page=~186}}&lt;/ref&gt; Former student [[Bianca Lamblin]] (originally Bianca Bienenfeld) wrote in her book ''Mémoires d'une jeune fille dérangée'' (English: ''Memoirs of a Disturbed Young Lady''), that, while she was a student at Lycée Molière, she had been sexually exploited by her teacher de Beauvoir, who was in her 30s at the time.&lt;ref&gt;''Mémoires d'une jeune fille dérangée'' (1994, LGF – Livre de Poche; {{ISBN|978-2-253-13593-7}}/2006, Balland; {{ISBN|978-2-7158-0994-9}})&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1943, de Beauvoir was suspended from her teaching job, due to an accusation that she had seduced her 17-year-old lycée pupil [[Natalie Sorokin]]e in 1939.&lt;ref&gt;''Tête-à-tête: Simone de Beauvoir and Jean-Paul Sartre'', Hazel Rowley, HarperCollins, 2005, pp. 130–35, {{ISBN|0-06-052059-0}};{{ISBN|978-0-06-052059-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sorokine's parents laid formal charges against de Beauvoir for debauching a minor and as a result she had her license to teach in France permanently revoked.&lt;ref&gt;''Intellectuals: From Marx and Tolstoy to Sartre and Chomsky'', Paul Johnson, Harper Perennial, 1988, pp. 238–38, {{ISBN|978-0-06-125317-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable works==

===''She Came to Stay''===
De Beauvoir published her first novel ''[[She Came to Stay]]'' in 1943.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/beauvoir/|title=Beauvoir, Simone de {{!}} Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|website=www.iep.utm.edu|language=en-US|access-date=2018-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is a fictionalised chronicle of her and Sartre's sexual relationship with [[Olga Kosakiewicz]] and [[Wanda Kosakiewicz]]. Olga was one of her students in the Rouen secondary school where de Beauvoir taught during the early 1930s. She grew fond of Olga. Sartre tried to pursue Olga but she rejected him, so he began a relationship with her sister Wanda. Upon his death, Sartre was still supporting Wanda. He also supported Olga for years, until she met and married [[Jacques-Laurent Bost]], a lover of de Beauvoir.

In the novel, set just before the outbreak of [[World War II]], de Beauvoir creates one character from the complex relationships of Olga and Wanda. The fictionalised versions of Beauvoir and Sartre have a [[ménage à trois]] with the young woman. The novel also delves into de Beauvoir and Sartre's complex relationship and how it was affected by the ménage à trois.

''She Came to Stay'' was followed by many others, including ''[[The Blood of Others]]'', which explores the nature of individual responsibility, telling a love story between two young French students participating in the [[French Resistance|Resistance]] in World War II.&lt;ref name="iep.utm.edu"&gt;http://www.iep.utm.edu/beauvoir/ Simone de Beauvoir&lt;/ref&gt;

===Existentialist ethics===
[[File:Simone de Beauvoir &amp; Jean-Paul Sartre in Beijing 1955.jpg|thumb|Simone de Beauvoir and Jean-Paul Sartre in [[Beijing]], 1955]]
In 1944 de Beauvoir wrote her first philosophical essay, ''Pyrrhus et Cinéas'', a discussion of an existentialist ethics. She continued her exploration of existentialism through her second essay ''[[The Ethics of Ambiguity]]'' (1947); it is perhaps the most accessible entry into [[Existentialism|French existentialism]]. In the essay, de Beauvoir clears up some inconsistencies that many, Sartre included, have found in major existentialist works such as ''Being and Nothingness''. In ''The Ethics of Ambiguity'', de Beauvoir confronts the existentialist dilemma of absolute freedom vs. the constraints of circumstance.&lt;ref name="plato.stanford" /&gt;

===''Les Temps modernes''===
{{main|Les Temps modernes}}
At the end of World War II, de Beauvoir and Sartre edited ''[[Les Temps modernes]]'', a political journal which Sartre founded along with [[Maurice Merleau-Ponty]] and others. De Beauvoir used ''Les Temps Modernes'' to promote her own work and explore her ideas on a small scale before fashioning essays and books. De Beauvoir remained an editor until her death.

===Sexuality, existentialist feminism and ''The Second Sex''===
''[[The Second Sex]]'', first published in 1949 in French as ''Le Deuxième Sexe'', turns the existentialist mantra that ''[[existence precedes essence]]'' into a feminist one: "One is not born but becomes a woman".&lt;ref&gt;Beauvoir, The Second Sex, 267&lt;/ref&gt; With this famous phrase, Beauvoir first articulated what has come to be known as the [[sex-gender distinction]], that is, the distinction between biological sex and the social and historical construction of gender and its attendant stereotypes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2017/entries/feminism-gender/|title=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|first=Mari|last=Mikkola|editor-first=Edward N.|editor-last=Zalta|date=3 January 2018|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|via=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt; "The fundamental source of women's oppression" Beauvoir notes, "is its historical and social construction as the quintessential" Other.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2015/entries/beauvoir/|title=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|last=Bergoffen|first=Debra|date=2015|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|editor-last=Zalta|editor-first=Edward N.|edition=Fall 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

De Beauvoir defines women as the "second sex" because women are defined in relation to men. Aristotle referred that women are "female by virtue of a certain lack of qualities". De Beauvoir also points out that St. Thomas referred to the woman as the "imperfect man", the "incidental" being.&lt;ref name="marxists.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.marxists.org/reference/subject/ethics/de-beauvoir/2nd-sex/introduction.htm|title=Simone de Beauvoir The Second Sex, Woman as Other 1949|first=Simone de|last=Beauvoir|website=www.marxists.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; De Beauvoir asserted that women are as capable of choice as men, and thus can choose to elevate themselves, moving beyond the '[[immanence]]' to which they were previously resigned and reaching '[[transcendence (philosophy)|transcendence]]', a position in which one takes responsibility for oneself and the world, where one chooses one's freedom.

Chapters of ''The Second Sex'' were originally published in ''Les Temps modernes'',&lt;ref&gt;Appignanesi 2005, p. 82&lt;/ref&gt; in June 1949. The second volume came a few months after the first in France.&lt;ref&gt;Appignanesi 2005, p. 89&lt;/ref&gt; It was very quickly published in America due to the quick translation by [[Howard Parshley]], as prompted by [[Blanche Knopf]], wife of publisher [[Alfred A. Knopf]]. Because Parshley had only a basic familiarity with the French language, and a minimal understanding of philosophy (he was a professor of biology at [[Smith College]]), much of de Beauvoir's book was mistranslated or inappropriately cut, distorting her intended message.&lt;ref name="Moi, Toril 2002"&gt;Moi, Toril 'While We Wait: The English Translation of "The Second Sex" in Signs 27(4) (summer, 2002), pp. 1005–35.&lt;/ref&gt; For years, Knopf prevented the introduction of a more accurate retranslation of de Beauvoir's work, declining all proposals despite the efforts of existentialist scholars.&lt;ref name="Moi, Toril 2002"/&gt; Only in 2009 was there a second translation, to mark the 60th anniversary of the original publication. Constance Borde and Sheila Malovany-Chevallier produced the first integral translation in 2010, reinstating a third of the original work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/books/review-the-second-sex-by-simone-de-beauvoir/article1615327|title=Review: The Second Sex, by Simone de Beauvoir|publisher=|via=The Globe and Mail}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the chapter "Woman: Myth and Reality" of ''The Second Sex'',&lt;ref&gt;Beauvoir, Simone de. "Woman: Myth and Reality".&lt;br&gt;** in Jacobus, Lee A. (ed.). ''A World of Ideas''. Bedford/St. Martins, Boston 2006. 780–95.&lt;br&gt;** in Prince, Althea, and Susan Silva Wayne. ''Feminisms and Womanisms: A Women's Studies Reader''. Women's Press, Toronto 2004 p.&amp;nbsp;59–65.&lt;/ref&gt; de Beauvoir argued that men had made women the "Other" in society by application of a false aura of "mystery" around them. She argued that men used this as an excuse not to understand women or their problems and not to help them, and that this stereotyping was always done in societies by the group higher in the hierarchy to the group lower in the hierarchy. She wrote that a similar kind of oppression by hierarchy also happened in other categories of identity, such as race, class and religion, but she claimed that it was nowhere more true than with gender in which men stereotyped women and used it as an excuse to organize society into a [[patriarchy]].

Despite her contributions to the feminist movement, especially the French women's liberation movement, and her beliefs in women's economic independence and equal education, de Beauvoir was initially reluctant to call herself a feminist.&lt;ref name="oxfordreference.com"/&gt; However, after observing the resurgence of the feminist movement in the late 1960s and early 1970s, de Beauvoir stated she no longer believed a socialist revolution to be enough to bring about women's liberation. She publicly declared herself a feminist in 1972 in an interview with ''[[Le Nouvel Observateur]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Fallaize|first=Elizabeth|title=Simone de Beauvoir: A critical reader|year=1998|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=978-0415147033|page=6|edition=Digital print }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018 the manuscript pages of ''Le Deuxième Sexe'' were published. At the time her adopted daughter, [[Sylvie Le Bon-de Beauvoir]], a philosophy professor, described her mother's writing process: Beauvoir wrote every page of her books longhand first and only after hired typists.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/29/books/review/simone-de-beauvoir-second-sex-manuscript.html|title=Revisiting Simone de Beauvoir's ''The Second Sex'' as a Work in Progress|access-date=2018-07-26|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''The Mandarins'' ===
[[File:Algren house Miller.jpg|thumb|Dunes cottage where Algren and de Beauvoir summered in [[Miller Beach]], Indiana]] 
Published in 1954, ''The Mandarins'' is set after the end of World War II and won her France's highest literary prize, the ''[[Prix Goncourt]]''. The book follows the personal lives of philosophers and friends among Sartre's and de Beauvoir's intimate circle, including her relationship with American writer [[Nelson Algren]], to whom the book was dedicated. Algren was outraged by the frank way de Beauvoir described their sexual experiences in both ''The Mandarins'' and her autobiographies. Algren vented his outrage when reviewing American translations of de Beauvoir's work. Much material bearing on this episode in de Beauvoir's life, including her love letters to Algren, entered the public domain only after her death.

==Later years==
[[File:Núñez-Beauvoir-Sartre-Che Guevara.jpg|thumb|left| [[Antonio Núñez Jiménez]], de Beauvoir, [[Sartre]] and [[Che Guevara]] in Cuba, 1960]]
De Beauvoir wrote popular travel diaries about time spent in the United States &lt;ref&gt;de Beauvoir, "America Day by Day", Carol Cosman (Translator) and Douglas Brinkley (Foreword), Berkeley: University of California Press, 1999. {{ISBN|9780520210677}}&lt;/ref&gt; and China and published essays and fiction rigorously, especially throughout the 1950s and 1960s. She published several volumes of short stories, including ''The Woman Destroyed'', which, like some of her other later work, deals with aging.

1980 saw the publication of ''[[When Things of the Spirit Come First]]'', a set of short stories centred around and based upon women important to her earlier years.&lt;ref name="iep.utm.edu"/&gt; Though written long before the novel ''She Came to Stay'', de Beauvoir did not at the time consider the stories worth publishing, allowing some forty years to pass before doing so.

[[Sartre]] and [[Merleau-Ponty]] had a longstanding feud, which led Merleau-Ponty to leave ''Les Temps Modernes''. De Beauvoir sided with Sartre and ceased to associate with Merleau-Ponty. In de Beauvoir's later years, she hosted the journal's editorial meetings in her flat and contributed more than Sartre, whom she often had to force to offer his opinions.

De Beauvoir also notably wrote a four-volume autobiography, consisting of: ''Memoirs of a Dutiful Daughter''; ''The Prime of Life''; ''Force of Circumstance'' (sometimes published in two volumes in English translation: ''After the War'' and ''Hard Times''); and ''All Said and Done''.&lt;ref name="iep.utm.edu"/&gt;

In the 1970s de Beauvoir became active in France's [[women's liberation movement]]. She wrote and signed the [[Manifesto of the 343]] in 1971, a manifesto that included a list of famous women who claimed to have had an abortion, then illegal in France. Some argue most of the women had not had abortions, including Beauvoir. Signatories were diverse as [[Catherine Deneuve]], [[Delphine Seyrig]] and de Beauvoir's sister Poupette. In 1974, abortion was legalised in France.

Her 1970 long essay [[La Vieillesse]] (''The Coming of Age'') is a rare instance of an intellectual meditation on the decline and solitude all humans experience if they do not die before about the age of 60.

In an interview with [[Betty Friedan]], de Beauvoir said: "No, we don’t believe that any woman should have this choice. No woman should be authorised to stay at home to bring up her children. Society should be totally different. Women should not have that choice, precisely because if there is such a choice, too many women will make that one. It is a way of forcing women in a certain direction."&lt;ref&gt;“A Dialogue with Simone de Beauvoir,” in Betty Friedan, It Changed My Life: Writings on the Women’s Movement (New York: Random House, 1976), pp. 311–12
&lt;/ref&gt;

In about 1976 de Beauvoir and Sylvie Le Bon made a trip to New York City in the United States to visit [[Kate Millett]] on her farm.&lt;ref&gt;Appignanesi 2005, p. 160&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Sartre+Beauvoir grave.JPG|right|thumb|De Beauvoir's and Sartre's grave at the [[Cimetière du Montparnasse]]]]

In 1981 she wrote ''La Cérémonie Des Adieux'' (''A Farewell to Sartre''), a painful account of Sartre's last years. In the opening of ''Adieux'', de Beauvoir notes that it is the only major published work of hers which Sartre did not read before its publication.

She contributed the piece "Feminism – alive, well, and in constant danger" to the 1984 anthology ''[[Sisterhood Is Global: The International Women's Movement Anthology]]'', edited by [[Robin Morgan]].&lt;ref name="global"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://catalog.vsc.edu/lscfind/Record/154795/TOC#tabnav |title=Table of Contents: Sisterhood is global : |publisher=Catalog.vsc.edu |date= |accessdate=2015-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Sartre died in 1980, de Beauvoir published his letters to her with edits to spare the feelings of people in their circle who were still living. After de Beauvoir's death, Sartre's adopted daughter and literary heir Arlette Elkaïm would not let many of Sartre's letters be published in unedited form. Most of Sartre's letters available today have de Beauvoir's edits, which include a few omissions but mostly the use of pseudonyms. De Beauvoir's adopted daughter and literary heir [[Sylvie Le Bon-de Beauvoir|Sylvie Le Bon]], unlike Elkaïm, published de Beauvoir's unedited letters to both Sartre and Algren.

De Beauvoir died of [[pneumonia]] on 14 April 1986 in Paris, aged 78.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/women/article-9014010 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-07-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111213135908/http://www.britannica.com/women/article-9014010 |archivedate=13 December 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; She is buried next to Sartre at the Montparnasse Cemetery in Paris.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3753">The '''single supplement''' is a [[travel industry]] premium charged to solo travelers when they take a room alone. The amount involved ranges from 10 to 100 percent of the standard accommodation rate.&lt;ref name="nyt"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/10/travel/singled-out-for-the-single-supplement.html | title=Singled Out (for the Single Supplement) | publisher=New York Times | date=8 March 2013 | accessdate=30 September 2015 | author=Rosenbloom, Stephanie}}&lt;/ref&gt; Solo travelers see this as an unfair form of discrimination, but vendors justify the charge as reflecting the fact that most accommodations are priced for double occupancy.&lt;ref name="nyt"/&gt;

Discounts for booking early or repeat bookings and programs that arrange shared accommodation are variations on pricing that can ameliorate the single supplement for solo travelers.&lt;ref name="nyt"/&gt; Research prior to travel may find companies that have removed the single supplement.

In 2013, around 12 percent of American adults planned to travel solo that year.&lt;ref name="nyt"/&gt;

==Background==
Vendors and agents in the [[travel industry]] quote package-deal and accommodation prices in terms of dollars per person when the customer travels in a group of two, that is, "twin share" or "double". The single supplement is a premium [[fee|surcharge]] applied to a traveler who travels alone but will use a room that caters for two.

Accommodation vendors argue that solo travelers should expect to pay for the luxury and convenience of having a room to themselves.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} Vendors also expect to be compensated for the cost of preparing a room for a guest, in cleaning and providing disposables, when only one person will be charged.&lt;ref name="nyt"/&gt;

The solo traveler argues that traveling alone is often a necessity rather than a luxury and that the cost of preparing rooms for guests should be distributed among customers without discrimination, or (more extremely) that couples should be surcharged for the privilege of not having to sleep apart.&lt;ref&gt;''Lonely planet travel guide - Maldives'' 5th edition. pg 61. Lyon, James. [[Lonely planet]] (2003) {{ISBN|9781740591768}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Those affected may choose an accommodation vendor or tour operator which caters specifically for the solo traveler. Singles networks may assist in finding a compatible travel companion.&lt;ref&gt;''Straightforward guide: getting the best out of your retirement'' pg 21. Grant, Patrick. Straightforward Ltd. (2009) {{ISBN|9781847161383}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://content.time.com/time/travel/article/0,31542,1997856,00.html] "Single-parent travel: more resorts offer deals." Link, Matthew. TIME. 23 June 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Framing effect==
Objections to the single supplement may be partly explained by the "[[Framing (social sciences)|framing]] effect" described by Nagle and Holden in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;''Smarter pricing: how to capture more value in your market.'' pg 48 and 137. Cram, Tony. Pearson education. (2006) {{ISBN|9780273706137}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This effect occurs when customers see cost as a combination of gains and losses. Take as example, a hotel room advertised at #£300, with a £25 discount for early booking and compare it with the same room at #£250, with a 10% single person surcharge. Customers will tend to choose the arrangement even though the cost of £275, is the same. Customers tend to choose gains over losses. An early booking discount is seen a gain, whereas a surcharge is seen as a loss.

The concept of '''spiritual death''' has varying meanings in various uses and contexts. "Spiritually dead" person may mean someone who is not spiritual (materialist, atheist) - one, who identifies himself with dead matter, though he is a living conscious being. Thus first meaning for "spiritual death" is "to become atheist".{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}} Another, narrow, "purified" meaning of "spiritual death" is "death in a spiritual way", "to die being a spiritual person, not being an atheist".{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}} Thus this means that "spiritual death" relates to two egos: soul ([[real self]], which is eternal), and ego ([[false self]], which is temporary or material). Difference in meanings come from misidentification of eternal soul to be "spiritually dead" or "material", which is nonsense for theist{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}. For theist there is no such thing as "spiritual death". Matter can be only dead, and soul can only be eternal. As put by the [[LDS Church]], "the body is as a glove, and the spirit the hand that moves".&lt;ref&gt;See Boyd K. Packer, Teach Ye Diligently [Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Co., 1975], pp. 231–33.)&lt;/ref&gt;  One cannot say "dead life", or "alive death". For contrast you can guess what is the meaning of "material life: life is always spiritual, though "material life" would mean just "to live having materialistic values".{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}{{Clarify|date=May 2012}}

==Christianity==
{{main|Spiritual death in Christianity}}

==Buddhism==
[[Buddhadasa]] called [[Dukkha]] Spiritual Death.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.suanmokkh.org/archive/arts/ret/haphung1.htm Buddhadasa Bhikkhu, "Happiness and Hunger", 1986] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111106151937/http://www.suanmokkh.org/archive/arts/ret/haphung1.htm |date=6 November 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Sangharakshita]] uses the term Spiritual Death to describe one stage in a system of meditation, where insight is gained into delusions about our existence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thebuddhistcentre.com/text/spiritual-death]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other views==
Followers of [[Ascended Master]] movements such as the [[Theosophical Society]], [[I AM Foundation]], and [[Elizabeth Clare Prophet]] have a different definition of the second death: The final extinguishing of the identity of a soul deemed by God to be beyond redemption. In this theology, people are believed to continue to reincarnate for many lifetimes on Earth with one of two final outcomes: 1) Reunion with God in the ritual of the [[Ascension of Jesus Christ|Ascension]], like [[Jesus]], or 2) Final judgment at the "court of the sacred fire," where the soul would be destroyed forever. The [[Unification Church]] teaches that spiritual death is the state of separation from God, but that it is not ever irreversible.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} Spiritual death (death for spiritual person, not for atheist) is the art of learning to die. It is only through this art that the consciousness of death of oneself (the self or ego that is afraid to die) is transformed into consciousness of the eternally new or young self or soul (the self or soul that accepts death for body, but never for soul him/herself, as soul is eternal).{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

==Secular usage==

===Social science===
Dr. [[John B. Calhoun]] saw the social breakdown of a population of mice given ample resources as a second death.  He saw this as a metaphor for the potential fate of man in an overcrowded but resource rich environment and made reference to the second death of the Book of Revelation.&lt;ref name ="mice"&gt;[http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/picrender.fcgi?artid=1644264&amp;blobtype=pdf John B. Calhoun, "Death Squared: The Explosive Growth and Demise of a Mouse Population" Proc. roy. Soc. Med. Volume 66 January 1973, pp80-88]&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Conservatism|Conservative]] [[Christian]] writers, such as Bill Perkins, have echoed this warning.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Hpa8jobQ2c0C&amp;pg=PP1 Bill Perkins, “Six Battles Every Man Must Win”, Tyndale Press, 1993, p 10]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Famous quotes ==
In his famous [[anti-war]] address "[http://www.americanrhetoric.com/speeches/mlkatimetobreaksilence.htm Beyond Vietnam: A Time to Break Silence]," delivered 4 April 1967 at a meeting of Clergy and Laity Concerned at [[Riverside Church]] in [[New York City]], [[Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.]] observed that "[a] nation that continues year after year to spend more money on military defense than on programs of social uplift is approaching spiritual death."

The [[metaphor]]  of [[Dwarfism|dwarfs]] '''standing on the shoulders of giants''' ({{lang-la|nanos gigantum humeris insidentes}}) expresses the meaning of "discovering truth by building on previous discoveries".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=reReCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA1&amp;lpg=PA1&amp;dq=%22discovering+truth+by+building+on+previous+discoveries%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=TuN_K9sGOa&amp;sig=TGBf2PGkv94NY9gOr_1jCCdP1oA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiNysCfqsTOAhWFeCYKHQPrDPUQ6AEIQzAG#v=onepage&amp;q=%22discovering%20truth%20by%20building%20on%20previous%20discoveries%22&amp;f=false|title=Strategic Sourcing in the New Economy|last=Keith|first=Bonnie|date=2016|website=Google Books|publisher=Palgrave McMillian|access-date=August 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This concept has been traced to the 12th century, attributed to [[Bernard of Chartres]]. Its most familiar expression in English is by [[Isaac Newton]] in 1675: "If I have seen further it is by standing on the shoulders of Giants."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Newton|first1=Isaac|title=Letter from Sir Isaac Newton to Robert Hooke|url=https://discover.hsp.org/Record/dc-9792/Description#tabnav|website=Historical Society of Pennsylvania|accessdate=7 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Attribution and meaning==

The attribution to Bernard of Chartres is due to [[John of Salisbury]]. In 1159, John wrote in his ''Metalogicon'': "Bernard of Chartres used to compare us to dwarfs perched on the shoulders of giants. He pointed out that we see more and farther than our predecessors, not because we have keener vision or greater height, but because we are lifted up and borne aloft on their gigantic stature." &lt;ref name="MacGarry Metalogicon"&gt;{{cite book

According to medieval historian [[R.W. Southern|Richard William Southern]], Bernard was comparing contemporary 12th century scholars to the ancient scholars of Greece and Rome:&lt;ref name="Southern Making"&gt;{{cite book

&lt;blockquote&gt;[The phrase] sums up the quality of the [[cathedral schools]] in the history of learning, and indeed characterizes the age which opened with [[Pope Sylvester II|Gerbert]] (950–1003) and [[Fulbert of Chartres|Fulbert]] (960–1028) and closed in the first quarter of the 12th century with [[Peter Abelard]]. [The phrase] is not a great claim; neither, however, is it an example of abasement before the shrine of antiquity. It is a very shrewd and just remark, and the important and original point was the dwarf &lt;!--note--&gt;''could''&lt;!--italics are original to Southern's text--&gt; see a little further than the giant. That this was possible was above all due to the cathedral schools with their lack of a well-rooted tradition and their freedom from a clearly defined routine of study.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:South rose window of Chartres Cathedral crop.jpg|thumb|right|An illustration of New Testament evangelists on the shoulders of Old Testament prophets, looking up at the Messiah (from the south [[rose window]] of [[Chartres Cathedral]])]] The visual image (from Bernard of Chartres) appears in the stained glass of the south transept of [[Chartres Cathedral#Windows|Chartres Cathedral]]. The tall windows under the [[Rose window|Rose Window]] show the four major [[Prophets of Christianity|prophets]] of the Hebrew Bible (Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, and Daniel) as gigantic figures, and the [[Four Evangelists|four New Testament evangelists]] (Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John) as ordinary-size people sitting on their shoulders. The evangelists, though smaller, "see more" than the huge prophets (since they saw the Messiah about whom the prophets spoke).

The phrase also appears in the works of the [[Jewish]] [[Tosafot|tosaphist]] [[Isaiah di Trani]] (c. 1180 – c. 1250):&lt;ref&gt;Teshuvot (responsa) haRid 301–303. See [http://www.leimanlibrary.com/texts_of_publications/60.%20Dwarfs%20on%20the%20Shoulders%20of%20Giants.pdf Shnayer Z. Leiman, ''Dwarfs on the Shoulders of Giants'', Tradition  Spring 1993]&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Should [[Joshua]] the son of Nun endorse a mistaken position, I would reject it out of hand, I do not hesitate to express my opinion, regarding such matters in accordance with the modicum of intelligence allotted to me. I was never arrogant claiming "My Wisdom served me well". Instead I applied to myself the parable of the philosophers. For I heard the following from the philosophers, The wisest of the philosophers was asked: "We admit that our predecessors were wiser than we. At the same time we criticize their comments, often rejecting them and claiming that the truth rests with us. How is this possible?" The wise philosopher responded: "Who sees further a dwarf or a giant? Surely a giant for his eyes are situated at a higher level than those of the dwarf. But if the dwarf is placed on the shoulders of the giant who sees further? ... So too we are dwarfs astride the shoulders of giants. We master their wisdom and move beyond it. Due to their wisdom we grow wise and are able to say all that we say, but not because we are greater than they.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Diego de Estella]] took up the quote in the 16th century; by the 17th century it had become commonplace. [[Robert Burton (scholar)|Robert Burton]], in ''[[The Anatomy of Melancholy]]'' (1621), quotes Stella thus:
&lt;blockquote&gt;I say with Didacus Stella, a dwarf standing on the shoulders of a giant may see farther than a giant himself.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Later editors of Burton misattributed the quote to [[Lucan]]; in their hands Burton's attribution ''Didacus Stella, in luc 10, tom. ii'' "Didacus on the [[Gospel of Luke|Gospel of ''Luke'']], chapter 10; volume 2" became a reference to Lucan's ''[[Pharsalia]]'' 2.10. No reference or allusion to the quote is found there.

Later in the 17th century, [[George Herbert]], in his ''Jacula Prudentum'' (1651), wrote "A dwarf on a giant's shoulders sees farther of the two."

[[Isaac Newton]] remarked in a letter to his rival [[Robert Hooke]] dated February 5, 1676 [[Old Style and New Style dates|[O.S.]]]&lt;ref&gt;Turnbull, H.W. ed., 1959. The Correspondence of Isaac Newton: 1661-1675, Volume 1, London, UK: Published for the Royal Society at the University Press. p. 416&lt;/ref&gt; (February 15, 1676 [N.S.]) that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;What Des-Cartes {{sic}} did was a good step. You have added much several ways, &amp; especially in taking the colours of thin plates into philosophical consideration. If I have seen further it is by standing on the sholders {{sic|nolink=y}} of Giants.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
This has recently been interpreted by a few writers as a sarcastic remark directed at Hooke's appearance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Crease |first=Robert P. |authorlink= Robert P. Crease |date=2008 |title=The Great Equations: The hunt for cosmic beauty in numbers |publisher=[[Constable and Robinson]] |page=82 |isbn=978-1-84529-281-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Hooke was not of particularly short stature, he was of slight build and had been afflicted from his youth with a severe [[kyphosis]]. However, at this time Hooke and Newton were on good terms and had exchanged many letters in tones of mutual regard. Only later, when Robert Hooke criticized some of [[Isaac Newton#Optics|Newton's ideas regarding optics]], was Newton so offended that he withdrew from public debate. The two men remained enemies until Hooke's death.

[[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]], in ''The Friend'' (1828), wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The dwarf sees farther than the giant, when he has the giant's shoulder to mount on.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Against this notion, [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] argues that a dwarf (the academic scholar) brings even the most sublime heights down to his level of understanding. In the section of ''[[Thus Spoke Zarathustra]]'' (1882) entitled "On the Vision and the Riddle", Zarathustra climbs to great heights with a dwarf on his shoulders to show him his greatest thought. Once there however, the dwarf fails to understand the profundity of the vision and [[Zarathustra]] reproaches him for "making things too easy on [him]self." If there is to be anything resembling "progress" in the history of philosophy, Nietzsche in "Philosophy in the Tragic Age of the Greeks" (1873) writes, it can only come from those rare giants among men, "each giant calling to his brother through the desolate intervals of time," an idea he got from [[Schopenhauer]]'s work in ''Der handschriftliche Nachlass''.&lt;ref&gt;Nietzsche, Friedrich Wilhelm, Keith Ansell-Pearson, and Duncan Large. "Philosophy in the Tragic Age of the Greeks." The Nietzsche Reader. Malden, MA: Blackwell Pub., 2006. 101–13. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Pakistan-U.S. Student Exchange Program 2011.jpg|thumb|Pakistan to U.S. Student Exchange Program, July 2011]]
A '''student exchange program''' is a program in which students from a secondary school or university [[study abroad]] at one of their institution's partner institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.ces.uc.pt/icopromo/documents/02%20Stella%20Ting-Toomey%20-%20Developing%20Intercultural%20Communication%20Competence%20-%20A%20Mindful%20Systems%20Perspective.pdf|title = Stella Ting-Toomey, Ph.D|date = October 2006|accessdate = October 25, 2014|website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

A student exchange program may involve international travel, but does not necessarily require the student to study outside their home country.

Foreign exchange programs provide students with an opportunity to study in a different country and environment experiencing the history and culture of another country.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Daly|first=Amanda|date=2011-04-01|title=Determinants of participating in Australian university student exchange programs|url=http://jri.sagepub.com/content/10/1/58|journal=Journal of Research in International Education|language=en|volume=10|issue=1|pages=58–70|doi=10.1177/1475240910394979|issn=1475-2409}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "exchange" means that a partner institution accepts a student, but does not necessarily mean that the students have to find a counterpart from the other institution with whom to exchange. Exchange students live with a host family or in a designated place such as a hostel, an apartment, or a student lodging. Costs for the program vary by the country and institution. Participants fund their participation via scholarships, loans, or self-funding.

Student exchanges became popular after [[World War II]], and are intended to increase the participants' understanding and tolerance of other cultures, as well as improving their language skills and broadening their social horizons. Student exchanges also increased further after the end of the [[Cold War]]. An exchange student typically stays in the host country for a period of 6 to 10 months. [[International student]]s or those on study abroad programs may stay in the host country for several years. Some exchange programs also offer [[academic credit]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

== Types of exchange programs ==
=== Short-term exchange ===
A short-term exchange program is also known as summer/intensive or cultural exchange program. These focus on homestays, language skills, community service, or cultural activities. High school and university students can apply for the programs through various government or non-governmental organizations that organize the programs. A short-term exchange lasts from one week to three months and doesn’t require the student to study in any particular school or institution. The students are exposed to an intensive program that increases their understanding of other cultures, communities, and languages.

=== Long-term exchange ===
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-09709-0002, Dresden, Ankunft eines indischen Gaststudenten.jpg|thumb|Enthusiastic welcome offered to the first Indian student to arrive to [[Dresden]], [[East Germany]] (1951)]]
A long-term exchange is one which lasts six to ten months or up to one full year. Participants attend high school in their host countries, through a [[student visa]]. Typically, guest students coming to the United States are issued a [[J-1 visa|J-1 cultural exchange visa]] or an [[F visa|F-1 foreign student visa]]. Students are expected to integrate themselves into the host family, immersing themselves in the local community and surroundings. Upon their return to their home country they are expected to incorporate this knowledge into their daily lives, as well as give a presentation on their experience to their sponsors. Many exchange programs expect students to be able converse in the language of the host country, at least on a basic level. Some programs require students to pass a standardized test for English language comprehension prior to being accepted into a program taking them to the United States. Other programs do not examine language ability. Most exchange students become fluent in the language of the host country within a few months. Some exchange programs, such as the [[Congress-Bundestag Youth Exchange]], are government-funded programs.

The Council on Standards for International Educational Travel is a not-for-profit organization committed to quality international educational travel and exchange for youth at the high school level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csiet.org/|title=CSIET|work=csiet.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Application process==
Long-term (10 to 12 month) exchange applications and interviews generally take place 10 months in advance of departure, but sometimes as little as four months. Students generally must be between the ages of 15 and 18.5. Some programs allow students older than 18 years of age in a specialized work-study program.

Some programs require a preliminary application form with fees, and then schedule interviews and a longer application form. Other programs request a full application from the beginning and then schedule interviews. High school scholarship programs often require a set [[GPA]] of around 3.0 or higher. Programs select the candidates most likely to complete the program and serve as the best ambassadors to the foreign nation. Students in some programs, such as Rotary, are expected to go to any location where the organization places them, and students are encouraged not to have strict expectations of their host country. Students are allowed to choose a country, but may live at any spot within that country.

The home country organization will contact a partner organization in the country of the student’s choice. Students accepted for the program may or may not be screened by the organization in their home country. Partner organizations in the destination country each have differing levels of screening they require students to pass through before being accepted into their program. For example, students coming to the U.S. may be allowed to come on the recommendation of the organization in their home country, or the hosting partner may require the student to submit a detailed application, including previous school report cards, letters from teachers and administrators, and standardized English fluency exam papers. The U.S. agency may then accept or decline the applicant. Some organizations also have Rules of Participation. For example, almost all U.S. organizations cannot allow an exchange student to drive an automobile during their visit. Some organizations require a written contract that sets standards for personal behavior and grades, while others may be less rigorous. Lower cost programs can result in a student participating without a supervisor being available nearby to check on the student's well-being. Programs provided by agencies that provide compensation for representatives are more likely to retain local representatives to assist and guide the student and keep track of their well-being.

== Costs ==
The costs of student exchange are determined by the charges from a student exchange program organisation or the university or college.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The costs vary depending on the country, length of study and other personal factors. Different programs through the school/university of choice may offer students scholarships that cover the expenses of travel and accommodation and the personal needs of a student.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://studentexchange.org.au/programs-overview/discounts-scholarships|title=Discounts and Scholarships {{!}} Student Exchange Programs {{!}} Over 25 Countries.

== Australian Context ==

=== Australian High school exchange programs  ===
Each state in Australia provides a different program of student exchange for secondary students. The programmes from each state are different for whether a student in Australia is looking to study internationally or a student from another country is looking to study in Australia. Student exchange in Australia, depending on the state, must be managed by registered exchange organisations or the school chosen for study must be registered.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.decinternational.nsw.edu.au/study/student-exchange|title=Secondary student exchange - DE International|website=www.decinternational.nsw.edu.au|access-date=2016-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The countries that are most popular for Australian students to choose to study are, Japan, France, Germany, USA, Italy, Canada, Belgium, Spain and Argentina. The main purpose of student exchange in Australia is to allow students to study,  engage and experience a new culture. International students who choose to study in Australia are given different opportunities through the programmes at set schools will learn about Australian culture, but also gain English language skills at a high school level.

=== Australian University students exchange programs ===
Exchange programs for University students to study abroad varies depending on the university campus offers.  International student exchange programs for university students is aimed to enhance students intercultural skills and knowledge. Student exchange programs for University students gives the opportunity to broaden their knowledge on their study of choice from a different country, this gives university students a chance to develop their work experience by seeing how the profession they are studying is practised in another country. International exchange for tertiary students allows them to gain a cultural experience on their studies, but also giving them a change to travel abroad while completing their degree.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lynas|first=Kathie|title=Student exchange program broadens world of participants|url=http://www.cpjournal.ca/doi/abs/10.3821/1913-701X-142.1.14|journal=Canadian Pharmacists Journal|volume=142|issue=1|pages=14–14|doi=10.3821/1913-701x-142.1.14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Foreign students in Spain ==
A series of studies conducted within the last decade found similar results in students studying abroad in Spain for a short-term and/or semester long program. These studies found that students can improve their speaking proficiency during one semester, there is a positive relationship between students’ integrative motivation and interaction with second language culture, and student contact with the Spanish language has a great effect on their speaking improvement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hernández|first=Todd A.|date=2010-12-01|title=The Relationship Among Motivation, Interaction, and the Development of Second Language Oral Proficiency in a Study-Abroad Context|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1540-4781.2010.01053.x/abstract|journal=The Modern Language Journal|language=en|volume=94|issue=4|pages=600–617|doi=10.1111/j.1540-4781.2010.01053.x|issn=1540-4781}}&lt;/ref&gt; We especially see these results in students who live with host families during their program. Anne Reynolds-Case found improvements in understanding and usage of the ''vosotros'' form after studying in Spain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Reynolds-Case|first=Anne|date=2013-06-01|title=The Value of Short-Term Study Abroad: An Increase in Students' Cultural and Pragmatic Competency|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/flan.12034/abstract|journal=Foreign Language Annals|language=en|volume=46|issue=2|pages=311–322|doi=10.1111/flan.12034|issn=1944-9720}}&lt;/ref&gt; One study specifically studies culture perceptions of students studying abroad in Spain. Alan Meredith defines culture as consisting “of patterns, explicit and implicit, of and for behavior acquired and transmitted by symbols, constituting the distinctive achievement of human groups, including their embodiments in artifacts.” Questionnaires were given to students living with host families during a two-month program in Spain. He studies how these groups perceive customs, such as concern for personal appearance, physical contact, cooking styles, politics, etc. The study found a variety of results depending the cultural custom. However, the American students’ perceptions most closely aligned with the Young Spaniards (16–22 years old).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Meredith|first=R. Alan|date=2010|title=Acquiring Cultural Perceptions during Study Abroad: The Influence of Youthful Associates|jstor=25758244|journal=Hispania|volume=93|issue=4|pages=686–702|doi=10.2307/25758244}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, Angela George’s study found little significance in the adoption of regional features during their semester abroad.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=George|first=Angela|date=2014-03-01|title=Study Abroad in Central Spain: The Development of Regional Phonological Features|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/flan.12065/abstract|journal=Foreign Language Annals|language=en|volume=47|issue=1|pages=97–114|doi=10.1111/flan.12065|issn=1944-9720}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though most of these studies focused on students who came from America to study in Spain, the United States is not the only one sending their students. Brian Denman’s article demonstrates an increase of Saudi student mobility for education, including locations such as Spain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Denman|first=Brian D.|last2=Hilal|first2=Kholoud T.|date=2011-08-01|title=From barriers to bridges: An investigation on Saudi student mobility (2006–2009)|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11159-011-9221-0|journal=International Review of Education|language=en|volume=57|issue=3-4|pages=299–318|doi=10.1007/s11159-011-9221-0|issn=0020-8566}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Drawbacks ==
Even though exchange students learn to improve themselves through the experience of studying and staying in another country, there are also many difficulties to be encountered. One of them is when exchange students are unable to adapt to pedagogy followed by the host country. Another is conflicts between the host family (who have provided accommodation) and the students, when it can not be solved by communicating with each other and the student usually will be asked to stay with another host until they find a new match. This process, however, could take time while the students' duration of stay is limited. Even with preparation and knowledge about the new environment, they could still experience [[culture shock]], which can affect them in different ways. Students from a completely different culture &lt;ref name="culture"&gt;http://www.foreignexchangestudentprograms.net/us-culture-guide-for-exchange-students&lt;/ref&gt; can also encounter homesickness for a longer period of time. Lack of transportation can also become a major problem, because the chances students buying a car during a short period of stay is less likely to happen. Moreover, students will find it hard to find a job, even part-time since most exchange visas do not allow students to work and it is difficult to obtain one that does.
Another potential drawback is health issues that can occur during the stay in a foreign country. All students are encouraged to consult a travel health expert, and be up to date with their vaccinations. Always have health insurance while traveling abroad, and carry emergency contact details of your local hosts and of multiple family members as well.&lt;ref&gt;http://travelsafeclinic.com/student-exchange-program/&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1865">'''Text declamation''' refers to the manner in which a composer sets [[lyrics|words]] to [[music]].&lt;ref&gt;Kerman, Joseph, and Gary Tomlinson. 2008. ''Listen, 6th edition''.  New York: Bedford St. Martins.&lt;/ref&gt;  Aesthetically declamation is conceived of as "accurate" (approximating the natural rhythms and patterns of human speech) or not, which informs perceptions about emotional power as expressed through the relationship between words and music.  

== Renaissance Composers and Word Painting ==
Late Renaissance composers in particular were concerned with matching text up with music in such a way that the latter could be said to express the former.  Madrigalists used a declamation technique known as [[word painting]] (aka text painting or tone painting) to make musical notes illustrate word meanings, trying literally to paint visual images with sonic materials.  [[Thomas Weelkes]]' [[madrigal (music)|madrigal]] "As Vesta was from Latmos hill descending" uses word painting throughout to declaim textual meaning:&lt;ref&gt;Altas, Allan W. 1998. Renaissance Music: Music in Western Europe, 1400-1600.  New York: W.W. Norton, 681.&lt;/ref&gt;

mm 1-9: "Latmos hill" -	"hill" is always set with the highest note in the phrase&lt;br /&gt;
mm 8-9:	"descending" - uses descending scales and leaps&lt;br /&gt;
mm 12-22: "ascending" - uses ascending scales&lt;br /&gt;
mm 36-46: "running down the hill" - uses quickly descending scales in [[imitative polyphony]]&lt;br /&gt;
mm 48-49: "two by two" - two voices sing&lt;br /&gt;
mm 50-51: "three by three" - three voices sing&lt;br /&gt;
mm 51-52: "together" - all six voices sing&lt;br /&gt;
mm 56-57: "all alone" - top voice sings alone&lt;br /&gt;
mm 84-100: "Long live fair [[Oriana]]" - low voice begins with [[longa (music)|longa]], continues with long, sustained notes

==Plot summaries==
The three films comprise a "[[coming of age]]" narrative in the vein of a ''[[bildungsroman]]''; they describe the childhood, education and early maturity of a young [[Bengali people|Bengali]] named Apu (Apurba Kumar Roy) in the early part of the 20th century.

'''''Pather Panchali''''' ([[Bengali language|Bengali]], "Song of the Little Road")&lt;br&gt;
Apu's early experiences in rural [[Bengal]] as the son of a poor but high caste family are presented. Apu's father Harihar, a [[Brahmin]], has difficulty in supporting his family. After the death of Apu's sister, Durga, the family moves to the holy city of [[Varanasi|Benares]].

'''''Aparajito''''' (Bengali, "The Unvanquished")&lt;br&gt;
The family's finances are still precarious. After his father dies there, Apu and his mother Sarbajaya come back to a village in Bengal. Despite unrelenting poverty, Apu manages to get formal schooling and turns out to be a brilliant student. The growing Apu comes into conflict with his mother. Later, when his mother dies too, he has to learn to live alone.

'''''Apur Sansar''''' (Bengali, "The World of Apu")&lt;br&gt;
Attempting to become a writer, Apu unexpectedly finds himself pressured to marry a girl whose mother rejected her mentally ill bridegroom on the day of their wedding. Their blossoming marriage ends in her death in childbirth, after which the despairing Apu abandons his child, but eventually returns to accept his responsibilities.

==Production==
In 1950, Ray had decided that ''[[Pather Panchali (novel)|Pather Panchali]]'', the classic coming of age story ([[bildungsroman]]) of [[Bengali literature]], published in 1928 by Bibhutibhusan Bandopadhyay, would be the subject matter for his first film. This semi-autobiographical novel describes the growing up of Apu, a small boy in a Bengal village. He went ahead with the film after meeting [[Jean Renoir]] during filming of ''[[The River (1951 film)|The River]]'' (1951) and after watching the [[Italian neorealism|Italian neorealist]] film ''[[Bicycle Thieves]]'' (1948) while he was in London. Besides the influence of [[European cinema]] and Bengali literature, Ray is also indebted to the [[Theatre of India|Indian theatrical tradition]], particularly the ''[[Rasa (aesthetics)|rasa]]'' theory of classical [[Sanskrit drama]]. The complicated doctrine of ''rasa'' centers predominantly on feelings experienced not only by the characters but also conveyed in a certain artistic way to the spectator. The duality of  ''rasa'' representation shows in ''The Apu Trilogy''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Cooper|first=Darius|title=The Cinema of Satyajit Ray: Between Tradition and Modernity|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|year=2000|isbn=978-0-521-62980-5|pages=1–4|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ray gathered an inexperienced crew, although both his cameraman [[Subrata Mitra]] and [[art director]] [[Bansi Chandragupta]] went on to achieve great acclaim. The cast consisted of mostly amateur artists. Shooting started in late 1952, using Ray's personal savings. He had hoped that once the initial shots had been completed, he would be able to obtain funds to support the project; however, such funding was not forthcoming.&lt;ref name=makepanchali&gt;{{Harvnb|Robinson|2003|pp=74–90}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Pather Panchali'' was shot over the unusually long period of three years, because shooting was possible only from time to time, when Ray or production manager [[Anil Chowdhury]] could arrange further money.&lt;ref name=makepanchali/&gt; With a loan from the [[Government of West Bengal|West Bengal government]], the film was finally completed and released in 1955 to great critical and popular success, sweeping up numerous prizes and having long runs in both India and abroad. During the making of the film, Ray refused funding from sources who demanded a change in script or the supervision of the producer, and he ignored advice from the government (which finally funded the film anyway) to incorporate a happy ending in having Apu's family join a "development project".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Seton|1971|p=95}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even greater help than Renoir's encouragement occurred when Ray showed a sequence to [[John Huston]] who was in India scouting locations for ''[[The Man Who Would Be King]]''. The sequence is the remarkable vision Apu and his sister have of the train running through the countryside. It was the only sequence Ray had filmed due to his small budget. Huston praised Ray to [[Monroe Wheeler]] at the [[New York Museum of Modern Art]], saying that a major talent was on the horizon.
&lt;!--  Commented out: [[Image:Apu Pather1.jpg|left|thumb|Wide open eyes, a continual motif in ''The Apu Trilogy'']] --&gt;
In India, the reaction to the film was enthusiastic; ''[[The Times of India]]'' wrote that "It is absurd to compare it with any other Indian cinema [...]. ''Pather Panchali'' is pure cinema".&lt;ref name="set1"&gt;{{Harvnb|Seton|1971|pp=112–15}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United Kingdom, [[Lindsay Anderson]] wrote a glowing review of the film.&lt;ref name="set1" /&gt; However, the reaction was not uniformly positive. After watching the movie, [[François Truffaut]] is reported to have said, "I don't want to see a movie of peasants eating with their hands."&lt;ref name=filmifunda&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bosley Crowther]], then the most influential critic of ''[[The New York Times]]'', wrote a mixed review of the film that its distributor Ed Harrison thought would kill off the film when it got released in the United States; however, it enjoyed an exceptionally long run.

Ray's international career started in earnest after the success of his next film, ''[[Aparajito]]'' (''The Unvanquished'').&lt;ref name= robintrilogy/&gt; This film shows the eternal struggle between the ambitions of Apu as a young man and the mother who loves him.&lt;ref name= robintrilogy&gt;{{Harvnb|Robinson|2003|pp=91–106}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some critics, notably [[Mrinal Sen]] and [[Ritwik Ghatak]], rank it even higher than the first film.&lt;ref name= robintrilogy/&gt; Aparajito won the [[Golden Lion]] at the [[Venice Film Festival]]. The film is also notable for introducing the technique of [[Reflector (photography)#Bounce lighting|bounce lighting]] to recreate the effect of daylight on sets, pioneered by the cinematographer [[Subrata Mitra]].&lt;ref name=cinematographers&gt;{{cite web|title=Subrata Mitra|publisher=Internet Encyclopedia of Cinematographers|url=http://www.cinematographers.nl/GreatDoPh/mitra.htm|accessdate=22 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ray had not thought about a trilogy while making ''Aparajito'', and it occurred to him only after being asked about the idea in Venice.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wood|1972|p=61}}&lt;/ref&gt; The final installation of the series, ''[[Apur Sansar]]'' (''The World of Apu''), was made in 1959. A number of critics find this to be the supreme achievement of the trilogy ([[Robin Wood (critic)|Robin Wood]], [[Aparna Sen]]). Ray introduced two of his favourite actors, [[Soumitra Chatterjee]] and [[Sharmila Tagore]], in this film. The film finds Apu living in a nondescript Kolkata house in near-poverty. He becomes involved in an unusual marriage with Aparna, the scenes of their life together forming "one of the cinema's classic affirmative depiction of married life",&lt;ref name="harvnb"&gt;{{Harvnb|Wood|1972}}&lt;/ref&gt; but tragedy ensues. After ''Apur Sansar'' was harshly criticised by a Bengali critic, Ray wrote an article defending it—a rare event in Ray's filmmaking career (the other major instance involved the film ''Charulata'', Ray's personal favourite).&lt;ref&gt;Ray mentions this in {{Harvnb|Ray|1993|p=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; His success had little influence on his personal life in the years to come. Ray continued to live with his mother, uncle and other members of his extended family in a rented house.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Robinson|2003|p=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical reception==
This trilogy is considered by critics around the globe to rank among the greatest achievements of [[Cinema of India|Indian film]], and it is established as one of the most historically important cinematic debuts. ''[[Pather Panchali (film)|Pather Panchali]]'' won at least thirteen international prizes (including Best Human Document at the [[1956 Cannes Film Festival]]), followed by eleven international prizes for ''[[Aparajito]]'' (including the [[Golden Lion]] at the [[Venice Film Festival]]) and numerous other awards for ''[[Apur Sansar]]'' (including the [[Sutherland Trophy]] at the [[London Film Festival]]). When Ray made ''Pather Panchali'', he worked with a cast and crew most of whom had never been previously involved in film. Ray himself at the time of directing ''Pather Panchali'' had primarily worked in the advertising industry, although he had served as assistant director on [[Jean Renoir]]'s 1951 film ''[[The River (1951 film)|The River]]''. From this foundation, Ray went on to create other highly acclaimed films, like ''[[Charulata]]'', ''[[Mahanagar]]'', and ''[[Aranyer Dinratri]]'', and his international success energised other Bengal filmmakers like [[Mrinal Sen]] and [[Ritwik Ghatak]].

&lt;!--  Commented out: [[Image:Pather Panchali2.jpg|thumb|Apu and his mother Sarbajaya in ''[[Aparajito]]'' (1956).]] --&gt;
This extract from ''Youth'', by South African author [[J. M. Coetzee]], talks of the music in the ''Apu trilogy'', which is based on [[Indian classical music]]:

{{cquote|
At the Everyman Cinema there is a season of Satyajit Ray. He watches the Apu trilogy on successive nights in a state of rapt absorption. In Apu's bitter, trapped mother, his engaging, feckless father he recognizes, with a pang of guilt, his own parents. But it is the music above all that grips him, dizzyingly complex interplays between drums and stringed instruments, long arias on the flute whose scale or mode – he does not know enough about music theory to be sure which – catches at his heart, sending him into a mood of sensual melancholy that lasts long after the film has ended. }}

On [[Rotten Tomatoes]], ''Pather Panchali'' has a 97% fresh rating based on an aggregate of 38 reviews&lt;ref name=RT-Pather&gt;{{Rotten Tomatoes|id=pather_panchali|title=Pather Panchali}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2009 was included in its list of top 100 foreign films.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Best of Rotten Tomatoes: Foreign|publisher=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|url=http://uk.rottentomatoes.com/top/bestofrt_genre.php?category=200010|accessdate=19 April 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090603095751/http://uk.rottentomatoes.com/top/bestofrt_genre.php?category=200010|archivedate=3 June 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Aparajito'' has a 94% fresh rating based on an aggregate of 16 reviews,&lt;ref name=RT-Aparajito&gt;{{Rotten Tomatoes|id=aparajito|title=Aparajito}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Apur Sansar'' (''The World of Apu'') has a 100% fresh rating based on an aggregate of 22 reviews.&lt;ref name=RT-World&gt;{{Rotten Tomatoes|id=world_of_apu}}&lt;/ref&gt; This makes ''The Apu Trilogy'' one of the highest-rated film trilogies of all time (97%, 94%, 100%), along with the [[Toy Story (franchise)|''Toy Story'' trilogy]] (100%, 100%, 99%), [[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' trilogy]] (91%, 96%, 93%), the original ''[[Star Wars]]'' trilogy (94%, 97%, 78%), and the [[Before Sunrise|Before Trilogy]] (100%, 95%, 98%).

==Theme==

===Influence===
According to Michael Sragow of ''[[The Atlantic|The Atlantic Monthly]]'' in 1994:

{{quote|In the four decades since Ray's debut as a writer-director—with the first Apu movie, Pather Panchali (1955)—his influence has been felt both in the type of work other directors attempt and in the means they employ to execute it. The youthful [[Coming of age|coming-of-age]] [[Drama film|dramas]] that have flooded art houses since the mid-fifties owe a tremendous debt to the Apu trilogy, which Terrence Rafferty has rightly called "cinema's purest [[Bildungsroman]]." (In baggy-pants homage to Ray, American TV's cartoon-burlesque Bildungsroman, ''[[The Simpsons]]''—which could be called "The Education of [[Bart Simpson]]"—contains an Indian convenience-store owner named [[Apu Nahasapeemapetilon|Apu]].)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=An Art Wedded to Truth|first=Michael|last=Sragow|year=1994|journal=[[The Atlantic|The Atlantic Monthly]]|url=http://satyajitray.ucsc.edu/articles/sragow.html|accessdate=11 May 2009|ref=harv|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090412212046/http://satyajitray.ucsc.edu/articles/sragow.html|archivedate=12 April 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

'''&lt;big&gt;Waiora&lt;/big&gt;''' is a trio of three indigenous [[Māori people|Māori]] performers from New Zealand.

The three members of Waiora are - Horomona Horo, Korey Atama, and Joshua Henare Rogers. The musical performances of Waiora are centred upon the ancient cultural practices of the Maori people and their musical instruments commonly referred to as [[Taonga Pūoro]]. Their performances combine elements of traditional war dances or [[haka]], melodic songs with lyrics written in the Maori language, and instrumental music that fuses the mystical sounds of taonga pūoro with guitar and percussive instruments from around the globe.

When the group was formed in early 2013 Waiora was originally a duo with the founding members being Horomona Horo and Joshua Henare Rogers. In March 2014 Korey Atama joined the group just before Waiora's performance at WOMAD Taranaki.

Historically the concept of Waiora was formed many years earlier in 2002 at a taonga pūoro workshop held at the Heitiki Art Gallery in Rotorua, New Zealand. Taonga pūoro expert Richard Nunns and his protegé Horomona Horo were tutoring the workshop. Classical guitarist Joshua Henare Rogers had decided to attend the workshop to learn more about the instruments to help with his composition of the seminal opus for taonga puūoro and classical guitar 'He Karanga Ki Te Ao' premiered three years later in Whakatane.

'''Zaza language''', also called '''Zazaki''', '''Kirmanjki''' and '''Dimli''', is an [[Indo-European language]] spoken primarily in eastern [[Turkey]] by the [[Zazas]]. The language is a part of the [[Northwestern Iranian languages|northwestern]] group of the [[Iranian languages|Iranian]] section of the [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] family, and belongs to the [[Zaza–Gorani languages|Zaza–Gorani]] and [[Caspian languages|Caspian dialect group]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/dimli Encyclopædia Iranica] Nevertheless, their language has preserved numerous isoglosses with the dialects of the southern Caspian region, and its place in the Caspian dialect group of Northwest Iranian is clear.&lt;/ref&gt; Zaza shares many features, structures, and vocabulary with [[Gorani language|Gorani]] (Hawrami), [[Shabaki language|Shabaki]], [[Bajelani language|Bajelani]] and [[Sarli language|Sarli]], because all this languages belongs to the subgroup Zaza-Gorani.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ethnologue.com/subgroups/zaza-gorani|title=Zaza-Gorani|work=Ethnologue|access-date=2018-10-28|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=AZGUEQmFqfMC&amp;pg=PA564&amp;lpg=PA564&amp;dq=zaza+gorani+shabak+language&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Rp5HArGnWg&amp;sig=_Qvw1GvO75a5Nb8LOHardxBu-zk&amp;hl=de&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjtyrzi_ZreAhXL2KQKHVtMCIk4ChDoATABegQICBAB#v=onepage&amp;q=zaza%20gorani&amp;f=false|title=A Survey of Word Accentual Patterns in the Languages of the World|last=Hulst|first=Harry van der|last2=Goedemans|first2=Rob|last3=Zanten|first3=Ellen van|date=2010|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|isbn=9783110196313|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zaza also has some similarities with [[Talysh language|Talyshi]] and other [[Caspian languages]].&lt;ref name="azargoshnasp.net"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.azargoshnasp.net/languages/zazaki/zazakipositionof.pdf |title=The Position of Zazaki Among West Iranian languages by Paul Ludwig |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2013-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Ethnologue]] (which cites [Paul 1998]),&lt;ref name="azargoshnasp.net" /&gt; the number of speakers is between 1.5 and 2.5 million (including all dialects).

== Classification ==
[[File:Iranian Family Tree v2.0.png|thumb|Family tree of Iranian languages]]

Zaza belongs to the [[Iranian languages|Iranian branch]] of the [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European language family]]. From the point of view of the [[spoken language]], its closest relatives are [[Gilaki language|Gilaki]], [[Mazandarani language|Mazandarani]], [[Hewrami]] and other Caspian languages{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}. The closest languages are genetically Hewrami and due to long-lasting influence Kurmanji (Northern Kurdish). However, the classification of Zaza has been an issue of political discussion. It is sometimes classified as a subdialect of [[Kurdish language|Kurdish]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9046467/Kurdish-language |title=Kurdish language – Britannica Online Encyclopedia |publisher=Britannica.com |date= |accessdate=2013-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tlfq.ulaval.ca/axl/asie/turquie_1general.htm According to the linguist Jacques Leclerc of Canadian "Laval University of Quebec, Zazaki is a part of Kurdish languages, Zaza are Kurds, he also included Goura/Gorani as Kurds]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="meb1"&gt;T.C.

Zaza appears to be a pejorative name designating the language as a form of jibberish evident that{{clarify|date=September 2018}} its speakers designate their language as ''[[Zaza–Gorani languages|Dimlī]]''  or ''Kirmānd̲j̲kī.''{{better source|date=September 2018}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://go.galegroup.com/ps/i.do?v=2.1&amp;u=new67449&amp;it=r&amp;id=GALE%7CCX2686309745&amp;p=GVRL&amp;sw=w&amp;authCount=1|title=Zaza|last=Paul|first=L.|date=|website=go.galegroup.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The US State Department "Background Note" lists the Zaza language as one of the major languages of Turkey, along with [[Turkish language|Turkish]] (official), [[Kurdish language|Kurdish]], [[Armenian language|Armenian]], [[Greek language|Greek]], and [[Arabic language|Arabic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/3432.htm |title=The US State Department "Background Note" on Turkey |publisher=State.gov |date= |accessdate=2013-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Linguists{{Like whom?|date=August 2017}} connect the word Dimli with the [[Daylamite]]s in the [[Alborz]] Mountains near the shores of the [[Caspian Sea]] in [[Iran]] and believe that the [[Zazas]] have immigrated{{when?|date=April 2018}} from [[Gilan|Deylaman]] towards the west. Zaza shows many connections to the [[Iranian languages]] of the Caspian region, especially the [[Gilaki language]].

The Zaza language shows similarities with [[Gorani language|Gorani]] (or Hawrami), [[Shabaki language|Shabaki]], [[Bajelani language|Bajelani]] and [[Sarli language|Sarli]]. However, it also shows many similarities with Kurmanji (Northern Kurdish), which it does not share with Caspian languages, Hewrami or other Kurdish languages:
* Similar personal pronouns
* Very similar ergative structure
* Masculine and feminine [[ezafe]] system
* Both languages have nominative and oblique cases that differs by masculine -î and feminine -ê
* Both languages have forgotten possesive enclitics, while it exists in other languages as Persian, Sorani, Gorani, Hewrami or Shabaki. 
* Both languages distinguishes between aspirated and unaspirated [[Voiceless stop|voiceless stops]].
* Similar vowel phonology
The Gorani, Bajelani, and Shabaki languages are spoken around the Iran-Iraq border; however, it is believed that speakers of these languages also migrated from Northern Iran to their present homelands.&lt;sup&gt;[''[[wikipedia:Citation needed|citation needed]]'']&lt;/sup&gt;{{when?|date=April 2018}} These languages are classified together in the [[Zaza–Gorani languages|Zaza–Gorani language group]].

== Dialects ==
There are three main Zaza dialects:
* '''[[Northern Zazaki|Northern Zaza]]''':&lt;ref&gt;{{ethnolink|kiu}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is spoken in [[Tunceli]], [[Erzincan]], [[Erzurum]], [[Sivas]], Gumushane, Mus (Varto), Kayseri (Sariz) provinces.

== Literature and broadcast programs ==

{{Main|Zaza literature}}
The first written statements in Zaza were compiled by the [[linguistics|linguist]] [[Peter Lerch]] in 1850. Two other important documents are the religious writings of [[Ehmedê Xasî]] of 1899,&lt;ref&gt;Xasi, Ehmedê (1899) ''Mewludê nebi'', reprinted in 1994 in Istambul {{OCLC|68619349}}, (Poems about the birth of Mohammed and songs praising Allah.)&lt;/ref&gt; and of [[Osman Efendîyo Babij]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://dimili.net/2242.html Osman Efendîyo Babij kamo? (Who is the Osman Efendîyo Babij?)]&lt;/ref&gt; (published in [[Damascus]] in 1933 by [[Celadet Bedir Khan]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zazaki.net/haber/kirmancca-zazaca-kurtcesinde-oykuculugun-gelisimi-737.htm|title=Kırmancca (Zazaca) Kürtçesinde Öykücülüğün Gelişimi|work=zazaki.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;); both of these works were written in the [[Arabic script]].

The use of the [[Latin script]] to write Zaza became popular only in the diaspora in Sweden, France and Germany at the beginning of the 1980s. This was followed by the publication of magazines and books in Turkey, particularly in [[Istanbul]]. The efforts of Zaza intellectuals to advance the comprehensibility of their native language by using that alphabet helped the number of publications in Zaza multiply. This rediscovery of the native culture by Zaza intellectuals not only caused a renaissance of Zaza language and culture but it also triggered feelings among younger generations of Zazas (who, however, rarely speak Zaza as a mother tongue) in favor of this modern [[Western world|Western]] use of Zaza, rekindling their interest in their ancestral language.

The diaspora has also generated a limited amount of Zaza language broadcasting. Moreover, after restrictions were removed on local languages in [[Turkey]] during their move toward an eventual accession to the [[European Union]], Turkish state-owned [[TRT Kurdî]] television launched several Zaza programs and a radio program on certain days.

== Grammar ==
As with a number of other Indo-Iranian languages like [[Kurmanji]] and [[Sorani]], Zaza features [[split ergativity]] in its [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphology]], demonstrating [[ergativity|ergative]] marking in [[past tense|past]] and [[Perfective aspect|perfective]] contexts, and [[Nominative-accusative language|nominative-accusative]] alignment otherwise. Syntactically it is nominative-accusative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Alignment in Kurdish: a diachronic perspective|url=http://kurdishacademy.org/sites/default/files/KurdAlignment_0.pdf|publisher=Kurdishacademy.org|accessdate=13 November 2012|year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Grammatical gender ===
Among all Western Iranian languages only Zaza and [[Kurmanji]] distinguish between masculine and feminine [[grammatical gender]]. Each noun belongs to one of those two genders. In order to correctly [[inflection|decline]] any noun and any [[grammatical modifier|modifier]] or other type of word affecting that noun, one must identify whether the noun is feminine or masculine. Most nouns have inherent gender. However, some [[Nominal (linguistics)|nominal]] roots have variable gender, i.e. they may function as either masculine or feminine nouns.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.zazaki.de/english/T.L.Todd-AGrammarofDimli.pdf|title=A Grammar of Dimili (also Known as Zaza)|last=Todd|first=Terry Lynn|publisher=Electronic Publication|year=2008|isbn=|location=|pages=33|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This distinguishes Zaza from many other Western Iranian languages that have lost this feature over time.

For example, the masculine [[preterite]] [[participle]] of the verb ''kerdene'' ("to make" or "to do") is ''kerde''; the feminine preterite-participle is ''kerdiye''. Both have the sense of the English "made" or "done". The grammatical gender of the preterite-participle would be determined by the grammatical gender of the noun representing the thing that was made or done.

The linguistic notion of grammatical gender is distinguished from the biological and social notion of [[gender]], although they interact closely in many languages. Both grammatical and natural gender can have linguistic effects in a given language.

== Vocabulary ==
Words in Zaza can be divided into five groups in respect to their origins. Most words in Zaza are [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]], [[Proto-Indo-Iranian]] and [[Proto-Iranian]] in origin. The fourth group consists of words that developed when Zaza speakers divided from the [[Proto-Iranian]] language. The fifth group consists of loan words. Loan words in Zaza are chiefly from [[Arabic]] and [[Persian language|Persian]].
