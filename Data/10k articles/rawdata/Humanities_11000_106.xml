'''Aerial photography''' (or '''airborne imagery''') is the taking of [[photograph]]s from an aircraft or other flying object.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=aerial photograph|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/aerial%20photograph|website=Merrian Webster|accessdate=2 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Platforms for aerial photography include fixed-wing [[aircraft]], [[helicopter]]s, [[unmanned aerial vehicle]]s (UAVs or "drones"), [[Balloon (aircraft)|balloons]], [[blimp]]s and [[dirigible]]s, [[rocket]]s, [[pigeon photography|pigeons]], [[Kite aerial photography|kites]], [[parachuting|parachutes]], stand-alone telescoping and vehicle-mounted poles. Mounted cameras may be triggered remotely or automatically; hand-held photographs may be taken by a photographer.

Aerial photography should not be confused with [[air-to-air photography]], where one or more aircraft are used as [[chase plane]]s that "chase" and photograph other aircraft in flight.

==History==

===Early history===
[[File:Brooklyn Museum - Nadar Élevant la Photographie à la Hauteur de l'Art - Honoré Daumier.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Honoré Daumier]], "Nadar élevant la Photographie à la hauteur de l'Art" (Nadar elevating Photography to Art), published in ''Le Boulevard'', May 25, 1862.]]
Aerial photography was first practiced by the French photographer and [[balloonist]] [[Gaspard-Félix Tournachon]], known as [[Nadar (photographer)|"Nadar"]], in 1858 over [[Paris]], [[France]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://professionalaerialphotographers.com/content.aspx?page_id=22&amp;club_id=808138&amp;module_id=158950 History of Aerial Photography] Professional Aerial Photographers Association (retrieved 5 October 2016)&lt;/ref&gt; However, the photographs he produced no longer exist and therefore the earliest surviving aerial photograph is titled 'Boston, as the Eagle and the Wild Goose See It.' Taken by [[James Wallace Black]] and [[Samuel Archer King]] on October 13, 1860, it depicts [[Boston]] from a height of 630m.&lt;ref&gt;Ron Graham and Roger E.

[[File:Kite Photo of Reeds Lake and Ramona Park, Grand Rapids MI. Postcard - 001.jpeg|thumbnail|left|Antique postcard using [[Kite aerial photography|kite photo]] technique. (circa 1911)]]
[[Kite aerial photography]] was pioneered by British meteorologist E.D. Archibald in 1882. He used an explosive charge on a timer to take photographs from the air.&lt;ref&gt;Archibald, Douglas (1897). [https://books.google.com/books?id=si7J_vmz76QC "The Story of the Earth's Atmosphere"]. p. 174. Retrieved 2011-04-16.&lt;/ref&gt; Frenchman [[Arthur Batut]] began using kites for photography in 1888, and wrote a book on his methods in 1890.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arch.ced.berkeley.edu/kap/background/history1.html |title=The First Kite Photographs |last=Benton |first=Cris |date=June 25, 2010 |accessdate=2011-04-16 |publisher=arch.ced.berkeley.edu |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110609184810/http://www.arch.ced.berkeley.edu/kap/background/history1.html |archivedate=2011-06-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espacebatut.fr/ |title=Arthur Batut Museum |accessdate=2008-01-08 |language=French }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Samuel Franklin Cody]] developed his advanced 'Man-lifter War Kite' and succeeded in interesting the British [[War Office]] with its capabilities.

The first use of a motion picture camera mounted to a heavier-than-air aircraft took place on April 24, 1909, over Rome in the 3:28 silent film short, ''[[Wilbur Wright und seine Flugmaschine]]''.

===World War I===
[[File:Spelterini Pyramids.jpg|thumb|right|[[Giza pyramid complex]], photographed from [[Eduard Spelterini]]'s balloon on November 21, 1904]]
The use of aerial photography rapidly matured during the war, as [[reconnaissance aircraft]] were equipped with cameras to record enemy movements and defences. At the start of the conflict, the usefulness of aerial photography was not fully appreciated, with reconnaissance being accomplished with map sketching from the air.

Germany adopted the first aerial camera, a [[Goerz (company)|Görz]], in 1913. The French began the war with several squadrons of Blériot observation aircraft equipped with cameras for reconnaissance. The French Army developed procedures for getting prints into the hands of field commanders in record time.

[[Frederick Charles Victor Laws]] started aerial photography experiments in 1912 with No.1 Squadron of the [[Royal Flying Corps]] (later [[No. 1 Squadron RAF]]), taking photographs from the British dirigible [[British Army airship Beta|''Beta'']]. He discovered that vertical photos taken with 60% overlap could be used to create a [[stereoscopic]] effect when viewed in a stereoscope, thus creating a perception of depth that could aid in cartography and in intelligence derived from aerial images. The Royal Flying Corps recon pilots began to use cameras for recording their observations in 1914 and by the [[Battle of Neuve Chapelle]] in 1915, the entire system of German trenches was being photographed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://northstargallery.com/aerialphotography/history%20aerial%20photography/history.htm|title=A Brief History of Aerial Photography}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1916 the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy made vertical camera axis aerial photos above Italy for map-making.

[[File:Rumpler Taube monoplane.jpg|thumb|left|A German observation plane, the [[Rumpler Taube]].]]
The first purpose-built and practical aerial camera was invented by Captain [[John Moore-Brabazon]] in 1915 with the help of the [[Thornton-Pickard]] company, greatly enhancing the efficiency of aerial photography. The camera was inserted into the floor of the aircraft and could be triggered by the pilot at intervals. Moore-Brabazon also pioneered the incorporation of stereoscopic techniques into aerial photography, allowing the height of objects on the landscape to be discerned by comparing photographs taken at different angles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historytoday.com/richard-cavendish/royal-flying-corps-founded|title=Royal Flying Corps Founded|publisher=History Today}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=J06OFiCSBroC&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s|title=How It Works: Science and Technology|author=Marshall Cavendish Corporation|year=2003|publisher=Marshall Cavendish|page=33}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the end of the war aerial cameras had dramatically increased in size and [[optical power|focal power]] and were used increasingly frequently as they proved their pivotal military worth; by 1918 both sides were photographing the entire front twice a day, and had taken over half a million photos since the beginning of the conflict. In January 1918, [[General Allenby]] used five Australian pilots from [[No. 1 Squadron RAAF|No. 1 Squadron AFC]] to photograph a {{convert|624|sqmi|km2}} area in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] as an aid to correcting and improving maps of the Turkish front. This was a pioneering use of aerial photography as an aid for [[cartography]]. Lieutenants [[Leonard Taplin]], [[Allan Brown (aviator)|Allan Runciman Brown]], H. L. Fraser, [[Edward Patrick Kenny]], and L. W. Rogers photographed a block of land stretching from the Turkish front lines {{convert|32|mi|km}} deep into their rear areas. Beginning 5 January, they flew with a fighter escort to ward off enemy fighters. Using [[Royal Aircraft Factory BE.12]] and [[Martinsyde]] airplanes, they not only overcame enemy air attacks, but also had to contend with {{convert|65| mph|kph|abbr=on}} winds, antiaircraft fire, and malfunctioning equipment to complete their task.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.southsearepublic.org/2002_1999/afc_aces_taplin.htm#top |title=Lieutenant Leonard T.E.

===Commercial aerial photography===
The first commercial aerial photography company in the UK was [[Aerofilms]] Ltd, founded by World War I veterans Francis Wills and [[Claude Graham White]] in 1919. The company soon expanded into a business with major contracts in Africa and Asia as well as in the UK. Operations began from the [[Stag Lane Aerodrome]] at Edgware, using the aircraft of the London Flying School. Subsequently, the [[Aircraft Manufacturing Company]] (later the [[De Havilland Aircraft Company]]), hired an [[Airco DH.9]] along with pilot entrepreneur [[Alan Cobham]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.screenonline.org.uk/people/id/585816/ BFI Screenonline: Friese-Greene, Claude (1898–1943) Biography&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:The center of New York 1932.jpg|thumb|[[New York City]] 1930, aerial photograph of Fairchild Aerial Surveys Inc.]]
From 1921, Aerofilms carried out vertical photography for survey and mapping purposes. During the 1930s, the company pioneered the science of [[photogrammetry]] (mapping from aerial photographs), with the [[Ordnance Survey]] amongst the company's clients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Municipal Air Surveys.

Another successful pioneer of the commercial use of aerial photography was the American [[Sherman Fairchild]] who started his own aircraft firm [[Fairchild Aircraft]] to develop and build specialized aircraft for high altitude aerial survey missions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Complete Encyclopedia of World Aircraft |page=382 |isbn=0-7607-0592-5 |year=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; One Fairchild aerial survey aircraft in 1935 carried unit that combined two synchronized cameras, and each camera having five six inch lenses with a ten-inch lenses and took photos from 23,000 feet. Each photo covered two hundred and twenty five square miles. One of its first government contracts was an aerial survey of New Mexico to study soil erosion.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=wN8DAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA535&amp;dq=Popular+Science+1935+plane+%22Popular+Mechanics%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=aJgvTv3XKdSgsQLVyIRv&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=9&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CEkQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true "Wide Area Is Mapped From Air By Giant Ten Lens Camera" ''Popular Mechanics'', October 1935] editors have stated Fairchild Aircraft in hand written comment to left of archived article&lt;/ref&gt; A year later, Fairchild introduced a better high altitude camera with nine-lens in one unit that could take a photo of 600 square miles with each exposure from 30,000 feet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|author=Hearst Magazines|title=Nine Lens Aerial Camera Films 600 Square Miles|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lNsDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA571|date=April  1936|magazine=Popular Science|publisher=Hearst Magazines|page=571}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===World War II===
[[File:Lockheed 12A G-AGTL Ringway 14.04.58 edited-2.jpg|thumb|[[Sidney Cotton]]'s [[Lockheed 12]]A, in which he made a high-speed reconnaissance flight in 1940.]]
In 1939 [[Sidney Cotton]] and [[Flying Officer]] [[Maurice Longbottom (RAF officer)|Maurice Longbottom]] of the [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] were among the first to suggest that airborne reconnaissance may be a task better suited to fast, small aircraft which would use their speed and high service ceiling to avoid detection and interception. Although this seems obvious now, with modern reconnaissance tasks performed by fast, high flying aircraft, at the time it was radical thinking.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

They proposed the use of [[Supermarine Spitfire|Spitfires]] with their armament and [[radio]]s removed and replaced with extra fuel and cameras.  This led to the development of the [[Supermarine Spitfire (early Merlin powered variants)#PR Mk I – Early Reconnaissance Versions|Spitfire PR]] variants.  Spitfires proved to be extremely successful in their reconnaissance role and there were many variants built specifically for that purpose. They served initially with what later became [[No. 1 Photographic Reconnaissance Unit RAF|No. 1 Photographic Reconnaissance Unit]] (PRU). In 1928, the [[RAF]] developed an electric heating system for the aerial camera. This allowed reconnaissance aircraft to take pictures from very high altitudes without the camera parts freezing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://web.mit.edu/6.933/www/Fall2000/edgerton/www/pre-hee.html#aerial|title=Photography Before Edgerton}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Based at [[RAF Medmenham]], the collection and interpretation of such photographs became a considerable enterprise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Cotton, Sidney|title=Aviator Extraordinary: The Sidney Cotton Story|publisher=Chatto &amp; Windus|year=1969|page=169|ISBN=0-7011-1334-0|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Aviator_extraordinary.html?id=TUHbAAAAMAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cotton's aerial photographs were far ahead of their time. Together with other members of the 1 PRU, he pioneered the techniques of high-altitude, high-speed [[stereoscopic]] photography that were instrumental in revealing the locations of many crucial military and intelligence targets. According to [[Reginald Victor Jones|R.V. Jones]], photographs were used to establish the size and the characteristic launching mechanisms for both the [[V-1 flying bomb]] and the [[V-2 rocket]]. Cotton also worked on ideas such as a prototype specialist reconnaissance aircraft and further refinements of photographic equipment. At the peak, the British flew over 100 reconnaissance flights a day, yielding 50,000 images per day to interpret. Similar efforts were taken by other countries.{{cn|date=May 2018}}

An example of how aerial photography is used in the field of archaeology is the mapping project done at the site Angkor Borei in Cambodia from 1995–1996. Using aerial photography, archaeologists were able to identify archaeological features, including 112 water features (reservoirs, artificially constructed pools and natural ponds) within the walled site of Angkor Borei.&lt;ref&gt;Stark, M.

==Platforms==

===Aircraft===
In the United States, except when necessary for take off and landing, full-sized manned aircraft are prohibited from flying at altitudes under 1000 feet over congested areas and not closer than 500 feet from any person, vessel, vehicle or structure over non-congested areas. Certain exceptions are allowed for helicopters, powered parachutes and weight-shift-control aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;United States [[Federal Aviation Regulations]] FAR part 91 section 119(14CFR91.119)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Radio-controlled model aircraft===
[[File:Drone Flying Eye.jpg|thumb|A drone carrying a camera for aerial photography]]
[[File:Aerial Drone and a Eurocopter HH-65 Dolphin photo D Ramey Logan.jpg|thumb|Two drones that can be used to take aerial photographs]]
Advances in [[radio controlled model]]s have made it possible for [[model aircraft]] to conduct low-altitude aerial photography.  This had benefited [[real-estate]] advertising, where commercial and residential properties are the photographic subject when in 2014 the US Federal Aviation Administration, issued an order banning the use of "Drones" in any commercial application related to photographs for use in real estate advertisements.&lt;ref name="gpo.gov"&gt;http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2014-06-25/pdf/2014-14948.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; This ban has since been lifted, as the FAA Part 107 regulations for small UAS became effective on August 29, 2016.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

Small scale model aircraft offer increased photographic access to these previously restricted areas. Miniature vehicles do not replace full size aircraft, as full size aircraft are capable of longer flight times, higher altitudes, and greater equipment payloads.  They are, however, useful in any situation in which a full-scale aircraft would be dangerous to operate.  Examples would include the inspection of transformers atop power transmission lines and slow, low-level flight over agricultural fields, both of which can be accomplished by a large-scale radio controlled helicopter.  Professional-grade, gyroscopically stabilized camera platforms are available for use under such a model; a large model helicopter with a 26cc gasoline engine can hoist a payload of approximately seven kilograms (15&amp;nbsp;lbs). In addition to gyroscopically stabilized footage, the use of RC copters as reliable aerial photography tools increased with the integration of FPV (first-person-view) technology. Many radio-controlled aircraft are now capable of utilizing Wi-Fi to stream live video from the aircraft's camera back to the pilot's or pilot in command's (PIC) ground station.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

==Regulations==

===Australia===
In Australia Civil Aviation Safety Regulation 101 (CASR 101)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.legislation.gov.au/Series/F1998B00220 |title=Civil Aviation Safety Regulations 1998 |publisher=Australian Civil Aviation Safety Authority |date=2002-12-19 |accessdate=2013-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; allows for commercial use of radio control aircraft.  Under these regulations radio controlled unmanned aircraft for commercial are referred to as Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS), where as radio controlled aircraft for recreational purposes are referred to as model aircraft. Under CASR 101, businesses/persons operating radio controlled aircraft commercially are required to hold an operator certificate, just like manned aircraft operators.  Pilots of radio controlled aircraft operating commercially are also required to be licensed by the Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.casa.gov.au |title=Civil Aviation Safety Authority |publisher=Australian Civil Aviation Safety Authority |date=2002-12-19 |accessdate=2013-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Whilst a small UAS and model aircraft may actually be identical, unlike model aircraft, a UAS may enter controlled airspace with approval, and operate within close proximity to an aerodrome.

Due to a number of illegal operators in Australia making false claims of being approved, CASA maintains and publishes a list of approved UAS operators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.casa.gov.au/aircraft/standard-page/uas-certificate-holders?WCMS%3ASTANDARD%3A%3Apc=PC_100959 |title=List of UAS Operator Certificate Holders |publisher=Australian Civil Aviation Safety Authority |date= |accessdate=2013-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, CASA has modified the regulations and from the 29th of September 2016 drones under 2&amp;nbsp;kg may be operated for commercial purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Part 101 Amendments – Cutting red tape for remotely piloted aircraft |publisher=CASA |year=2016 |url=https://www.casa.gov.au/aircraft/standard-page/part-101-amendments-cutting-red-tape-remotely-piloted-aircraft |accessdate=5 October 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===

2006 FAA regulations grounding all commercial RC model flights have been upgraded to require formal FAA certification before permission is granted to fly at any altitude in the US.

June 25, 2014, The FAA, in ruling 14 CFR Part 91 [Docket No. FAA–2014–0396] "Interpretation of the Special Rule for Model Aircraft", banned the commercial use of unmanned aircraft over U.S. airspace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Huerta |first=Michael P. |title=Interpretation of the Special Rule for Model Aircraft |work= |publisher=FAA |date=18 June 2014 |url=http://www.faa.gov/uas/media/model_aircraft_spec_rule.pdf |accessdate=5 October 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On September 26, 2014, the FAA began granting the right to use drones in aerial filmmaking. Operators are required to be licensed pilots and must keep the drone in view at all times. Drones cannot be used to film in areas where people might be put at risk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=U.S. Transportation Secretary Foxx Announces FAA Exemptions for Commercial UAS Movie and TV Production |work=Press Release |publisher=[[FAA]] |date=25 September 2014 |url=http://www.faa.gov/news/press_releases/news_story.cfm?newsId=17194 |accessdate=4 October 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The FAA Modernization and Reform Act of 2012 established, in Section 336, a special rule for model aircraft. In Section 336, Congress confirmed the FAA’s long-standing position that model aircraft are aircraft. Under the terms of the Act, a model aircraft is defined as "an unmanned aircraft" that is "(1) capable of sustained flight in the atmosphere; (2) flown within visual line of sight of the person operating the aircraft; and (3) flown for hobby or recreational purposes."&lt;ref&gt;Public Law 112–95, section 336(c).&lt;/ref&gt;

Because anything capable of being viewed from a [[public space]] is considered outside the realm of [[privacy]] in the United States, aerial photography may legally document features and occurrences on private property.&lt;ref&gt;''[[California v. Ciraolo]]'', 476 U.S. 206 (1986)&lt;/ref&gt;

The FAA can pursue enforcement action against persons operating model aircraft who endanger the safety of the national airspace system. Public Law 112–95, section 336(b).&lt;ref name="gpo.gov"/&gt;

June 21, 2016, the FAA released its summary of small unmanned aircraft rules (Part 107). The rules established guidelines for small UAS operators including operating only during the daytime, a 400&amp;nbsp;ft. ceiling and pilots must keep the UAS in visual range.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.faa.gov/uas/media/Part_107_Summary.pdf|title=SUMMARY OF SMALL UNMANNED AIRCRAFT RULE (PART 107)|last=|first=|date=|website=FAA|access-date=21 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

April 7, 2017, the FAA announced special security instructions under 14 &lt;abbr&gt;CFR&lt;/abbr&gt; § 99.7. Effective April 14, 2017, all UAS flights within 400 feet of the lateral boundaries of U.S. military installations are prohibited unless a special permit is secured from the base and/or the FAA.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.faa.gov/uas/where_to_fly/airspace_restrictions/|title=Security Sensitive Airspace Restrictions|last=|first=|date=|website=FAA|access-date=April 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===

Aerial photography in the UK has tight regulations as to where a drone is able to fly.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.aerialrepublic.com/drone-hire/uk-drone-law-licensing-need-know/|title=UK Drone law|website=Aerial Republic|access-date=May 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aerial Photography on Light aircraft under 20&amp;nbsp;kg. Basic Rules for non commercial flying Of a SUA (Small Unmanned Aircraft).

Article 241 Endangering safety of any person or property.
A person must not recklessly or negligently cause or permit an aircraft to endanger
any person or property.

Article 94 small unmanned aircraft
1. A person must not cause or permit any article or animal (whether or not attached to a parachute) to be dropped from a small unmanned aircraft so as to endanger persons or property.

2. The person in charge of a small unmanned aircraft may only fly the aircraft if reasonably satisfied that the flight can safely be made.

3. The person in charge of a small unmanned aircraft must maintain direct, unaided visual contact with the aircraft sufficient to monitor its flight path in relation to other aircraft, persons, vehicles, vessels and structures for the purpose of avoiding collisions. (500metres)

4. The person in charge of a small unmanned aircraft which has a mass of more than 7&amp;nbsp;kg excluding its fuel but including any articles or equipment installed in or attached to the aircraft at the commencement of its flight, must not fly the aircraft:
4.1  In Class A, C, D or E airspace unless the permission of the appropriate air traffic control unit has been obtained;
4.2  Within an aerodrome traffic zone during the notified hours of watch of the air traffic control unit (if any) at that aerodrome unless the permission of any such air traffic control unit has been obtained;
4.3 At a height of more than 400 feet above the surface

5. The person in charge of a small unmanned aircraft must not fly the aircraft for the purposes of commercial operations except in accordance with a permission granted by the CAA.

Article 95 small unmanned surveillance aircraft
1. You Must not fly your aircraft over or within 150 metres of any congested Area. (This is quite vague, err on the side of caution if an accident did happen, it’s the authorities view against you).

2.  Over or within 150 metres of an organised open-air assembly of more than 1,000 persons.

3. Within 50 metres of any vessel, vehicle or structure which is not under the control of the person in charge of the aircraft.

4. Within 50 metres of any person, during take-off or landing, a small unmanned surveillance aircraft must not be flown within 30 metres of any person. This does not apply to the person in charge of the small unmanned surveillance aircraft or a person under the control of the person in charge of the aircraft.

Model aircraft with a mass of more than 20&amp;nbsp;kg are termed ‘Large Model Aircraft’ – within the UK, large model aircraft may only be flown in accordance with an Exemption from the ANO, which must be issued by the CAA.

&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==

===Oblique===
[[File:Boca Raton Airport rwy 5 Photo D Ramey Logan.jpg|thumb|Oblique Aerial Photo]]
Photographs taken at an angle are called ''oblique photographs''.  If they are taken from a low angle relative to the earth's surface, they are called ''low oblique'' and photographs taken from a high angle are called ''high'' or ''steep oblique''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://userpages.umbc.edu/~tbenja1/umbc7/santabar/vol1/lec6/6-1.html |title=Lecture 6.1: Classification of Photographs |work=The Remote Sensing Core Curriculum |publisher=University of Maryland, Baltimore County |year=1999 |accessdate=2011-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Aerail Photographer.jpg|150px|thumb|An aerial photographer prepares continuous oblique shooting in a Cessna 206]]

===Vertical===
[[File:Large Blue Whale Off Southern California Coast Photo D Ramey Logan.jpg|left|thumb|Vertical Orientation Aerial Photo]]
Vertical photographs are taken straight down.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rst.gsfc.nasa.gov/Sect10/Sect10_1.html |title=Elements of Aerial Photography |first=Nicholas |last=Short |work=Remote Sensing Tutorial Page 10-1 |publisher=[[NASA]] |date=2010-04-28 |accessdate=2011-03-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110317194519/http://rst.gsfc.nasa.gov/Sect10/Sect10_1.html |archivedate=March 17, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  They are mainly used in [[photogrammetry]] and image interpretation.  Pictures that will be used in photogrammetry are traditionally taken with special large format cameras with [[Calibration|calibrated]] and documented geometric properties.

===Combinations===
Aerial photographs are often combined.  Depending on their purpose it can be done in several ways, of which a few are listed below.
* [[Panorama]]s can be made by [[Image stitching|stitching]] several photographs taken in different angles from one spot (e.g. with a hand held camera) or from different spots at the same angle (e.g. from a plane).
* [[Stereo photography techniques]] allow for the creation of 3D-images from several photographs of the same area taken from different spots.
* In [[pictometry]] five rigidly mounted cameras provide one vertical and four low oblique pictures that can be used together.
* In some digital cameras for aerial photogrammetry images from several imaging elements, sometimes with separate lenses, are geometrically corrected and combined to one image in the camera.

===Orthophotos===
Vertical photographs are often used to create [[orthophoto]]s, alternatively known as [[orthophotomap]]s, photographs which have been geometrically "corrected" so as to be usable as a map. In other words, an orthophoto is a simulation of a photograph taken from an infinite distance, looking straight down to [[nadir]]. Perspective must obviously be removed, but variations in terrain should also be corrected for. Multiple geometric transformations are applied to the image, depending on the perspective and terrain corrections required on a particular part of the image.

Orthophotos are commonly used in [[geographic information system]]s, such as are used by mapping agencies (e.g. [[Ordnance Survey]]) to create maps. Once the images have been aligned, or "registered", with known real-world coordinates, they can be widely deployed.

Large sets of orthophotos, typically derived from multiple sources and divided into "tiles" (each typically 256 x 256 pixels in size), are widely used in online map systems such as [[Google Maps]]. [[OpenStreetMap]] offers the use of similar orthophotos for deriving new map data. [[Google Earth]] overlays orthophotos or [[satellite imagery]] onto a [[digital elevation model]] to simulate 3D landscapes.

==Aerial video==
[[File:Cliffs of Moher drone-video.webm|thumb|The [[Cliffs of Moher]], filmed with a drone (2014)]]
With advancements in video technology, [[aerial video]] is becoming more popular. Orthogonal video is shot from aircraft mapping pipelines, crop fields, and other points of interest.  Using GPS, video may be embedded with meta data and later synced with a video mapping program.

This "Spatial Multimedia" is the timely union of digital media including still photography, motion video, stereo, panoramic imagery sets, immersive media constructs, audio, and other data with location and date-time information from the GPS and other location designs.

Aerial videos are emerging Spatial Multimedia which can be used for scene understanding and object tracking. The input video is captured by low flying aerial platforms and typically consists of strong parallax from non-ground-plane structures. The integration of digital video, global positioning systems (GPS) and automated image processing will improve the accuracy and cost-effectiveness of data collection and reduction. Several different aerial platforms are under investigation for the data collection.

'''Agnostic atheism''' is a philosophical position that encompasses both [[atheism]] and [[agnosticism]]. Agnostic atheists are atheistic because they do not hold a [[belief]] in the existence of any deity and agnostic because they claim that the existence of a [[deity]] is either unknowable in principle or currently unknown in fact.

The agnostic atheist may be contrasted with the [[agnostic theist]], who believes that one or more deities exist but claims that the existence or nonexistence of such is unknown or cannot be known.&lt;ref&gt;

== History ==
[[File:Irreligion map.png|thumb|250px|Fraction of atheists and agnostics in different countries]]

One of the earliest definitions of agnostic atheism is that of theologian and philosopher [[Robert Flint]], in his Croall Lecture of 1887–1888 (published in 1903 under the title ''Agnosticism'').

&lt;blockquote&gt;The atheist may however be, and not unfrequently is, an agnostic. There is an agnostic atheism or atheistic agnosticism, and the combination of atheism with agnosticism which may be so named is not an uncommon one.&lt;ref name=flint&gt;{{cite book|last=Flint|first=Robert|authorlink=Robert Flint|title=Agnosticism: The Croall Lecture for 1887–88|year=1903|publisher=William Blackwood and Sons|ol=7193167M|pages=49–51|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DWMtAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA49}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;If a man has failed to find any good reason for believing that there is a God, it is perfectly natural and rational that he should not believe that there is a God; and if so, he is an atheist... if he goes farther, and, after an investigation into the nature and reach of human knowledge, ending in the conclusion that the existence of God is incapable of proof, cease to believe in it on the ground that he cannot know it to be true, he is an agnostic and also an atheist – an agnostic-atheist – an atheist because an agnostic... while, then, it is erroneous to identify agnosticism and atheism, it is equally erroneous so to separate them as if the one were exclusive of the other...&lt;ref name=flint/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1885 [[Robert G. Ingersoll]], popularly known as "The Great Agnostic", explained his comparative view of agnosticism and atheism as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Jacoby |first=Susan |date=2013 |title=The Great Agnostic |location= |publisher=Yale University Press |page =17 | isbn=978-0-300-13725-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|The Agnostic is an Atheist. The Atheist is an Agnostic. The Agnostic says, ‘I do not know, but I do not believe there is any God.’ The Atheist says the same.}}

==Epistemological arguments ==
{{Further|Theological noncognitivism}}
[[Epistemology|Epistemological]], or agnostic, atheism argues that people cannot know a God or determine the existence of a God. The foundation of epistemological atheism is agnosticism, which takes a variety of forms. In the philosophy of [[immanence]], divinity is inseparable from the world itself, including a person's mind, and each person's [[consciousness]] is locked in the [[Subject (philosophy)|subject]]. According to this form of agnosticism, this limitation in perspective prevents any objective inference from belief in a god to assertions of its existence.

The [[Rationalism|rationalistic]] agnosticism of [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] and the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] only accepts knowledge deduced with human rationality; this form of atheism holds that gods are not discernible as a matter of principle, and therefore cannot be known to exist. [[Skepticism]], based on the ideas of [[David Hume|Hume]], asserts that certainty about anything is impossible, so one can never know for sure whether or not a god exists. Hume, however, held that such unobservable metaphysical concepts should be rejected as "sophistry and illusion". The allocation of agnosticism to atheism is disputed; it can also be regarded as an independent, basic worldview.

Other arguments for atheism that can be classified as epistemological or [[ontology|ontological]], including [[logical positivism]] and [[ignosticism]], assert the meaninglessness or unintelligibility of basic terms such as "God" and statements such as "God is all-powerful." [[Theological noncognitivism]] holds that the statement "God exists" does not express a proposition, but is nonsensical or cognitively meaningless. It has been argued both ways as to whether such individuals can be classified into some form of atheism or agnosticism. Philosophers [[Alfred Ayer|A. J. Ayer]] and [[Theodore M. Drange]] reject both categories, stating that both camps accept "God exists" as a proposition; they instead place noncognitivism in its own category.&lt;ref&gt;[[Theodore Drange|Drange, Theodore M.]] (1998). "[http://www.infidels.org/library/modern/theodore_drange/definition.html Atheism, Agnosticism, Noncognitivism]". [[Internet Infidels]], ''Secular Web Library''. Retrieved 2007-APR-07.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Alfred Ayer|Ayer, A. J.]] (1946). ''Language, Truth and Logic''. Dover. pp. 115–116. In a footnote, Ayer attributes this view to "Professor [[H. H. Price]]".&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Busan''' ({{IPA-ko|pu.sɐn}}), formerly known as '''Pusan''' and now officially {{nowrap|'''Busan [[List of special cities of South Korea|Metropolitan City]]''',}} is [[South Korea]]'s [[List of South Korean cities|second most-populous city]] after [[Seoul]], with a population of over 3.5 million inhabitants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://worldpopulationreview.com/world-cities/busan-population/|title=Busan Population 2018|date=17 December 2017|website=World Population Review|access-date=11 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the economic, cultural and educational center of southeastern Korea, with its port—Korea's busiest and the [[List of busiest ports by cargo tonnage|9th-busiest in the world]]{{efn|This is computed by cargo tonnage.

The surrounding "Southeast Economic Zone" (including [[Ulsan]] and [[South Gyeongsang Province|South Gyeongsang]]) is now South Korea's largest industrial area.

Busan is divided into 15 major administrative districts and a single county, together housing a population of approximately 3.6 million. The full metropolitan area, including the adjacent cities of [[Gimhae]] and [[Yangsan]], has a population of approximately 4.6 million. The most densely built-up areas of the city are situated in a number of narrow valleys between the [[Nakdong River|Nakdong]] and the Suyeong Rivers, with mountains separating most of the districts. The Nakdong is [[Rivers of Korea|Korea's longest river]] and Busan's [[Haeundae Beach]] is also the country's largest.

Busan is a center for international conventions, hosting [[Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation|APEC]] in 2005. It is also a center for sports tournaments in Korea, having hosted the [[2002 Asian Games]] and [[2002 FIFA World Cup|FIFA World Cup]]. It is home to the world's largest [[department store]], the [[Shinsegae]] [[Centum City]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://community.guinnessworldrecords.com/_Largest-Department-Store/blog/411871/7691.html |title=Largest Department Store - Guinness World Records Blog post - Home of the Longest, Shortest, Fastest, Tallest facts and feats |publisher=Community.guinnessworldrecords.com |date=2009-06-29 |accessdate=2011-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Busan was added to the [[Creative Cities Network|UNESCO Creative Cities Network]] as a "City of Film" in December 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://english.yonhapnews.co.kr/culturesports/2015/05/07/93/0701000000AEN20150507006100315F.html|title=Busan city on UNESCO's Creative Cities Network main page|work=Yonhap News Agency|access-date=2018-10-03|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The name "Busan" is the [[Revised Romanization of Korean|Revised Romanization]] of the city's Korean name since the late 15th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The origin of the name Busan |url=http://www.busan.go.kr/04ocean/0405history/01_01.jsp|publisher=Busan City |accessdate=4 January 2012 |language=ko |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120503201720/http://busan.go.kr/04ocean/0405history/01_01.jsp |archivedate=3 May 2012 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It officially replaced the earlier [[McCune-Reischauer romanization]] '''Pusan'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://geographic.org/geographic_names/name.php?uni=-1007276&amp;fid=3437&amp;c=south_korea |title=Pusan: South Korea |work=Geographical Names |accessdate=2011-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 2000.{{efn|This name is also encountered as "Pusan City" (''Pusan-si'')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://geographic.org/geographic_names/name.php?uni=-1007290&amp;fid=3441&amp;c=south_korea |title=Pusan-si: South Korea |work=Geographical Names |accessdate=2011-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "Pusan Directly-Administered City" (''Busan-jikhalsi''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://geographic.org/geographic_names/name.php?uni=-1007284&amp;fid=3441&amp;c=south_korea |title=Pusan-jikhalsi: South Korea |work=Geographical Names |accessdate=2011-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; or ''Pusan-chikhalsi'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://geographic.org/geographic_names/name.php?uni=-1007279&amp;fid=3420&amp;c=south_korea |title=Pusan-chikhalsi: South Korea |work=Geographical Names |accessdate=2011-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} The name {{nowrap|{{lang|zh|{{linktext|釜山}}}}}} (now written {{nowrap |{{lang|ko|{{linktext|부산}}}}}} using the [[hangul]] syllabary) is [[Sino-Korean vocabulary|Sino-Korean]] for "Cauldron Mountain", believed to be a former name of Mt&amp;nbsp;Hwangryeong {{nowrap|({{lang|ko|{{linktext|황령|산}}}},}} {{nowrap|{{lang|zh|{{linktext|荒嶺|山}}}},}} ''Hwangryeong-san'') west of the city center. The area's ancient state Mt{{nbsp}}Geochil ({{lang|ko|거칠산국}}, {{lang|zh|居柒山國}}, ''Geochilsan-guk'', "Rough-Mountain Land") is similarly thought to refer to the same mountain, which towers over the town's harbor on the Suyeong. (The later Silla district of Geochilsan-gun was renamed [[Dongnae]] in 757.)

The [[grave goods]] excavated from mounded burials at [[Bokcheon-dong]] indicate that a complex [[chiefdom]] ruled by powerful individuals was present in the Busan area in the 4th century, just as [[Three Kingdoms of Korea|Korea's Three Kingdoms]] were forming. The mounded burials of [[Bokcheon-dong]] were built along the top of a ridge that overlooks a wide area that makes up parts of modern-day [[Dongnae-gu]] and [[Yeonje-gu]]. Archaeologists excavated more than 250 iron weapons and [[ingot]]s from Burial No. 38, a wooden chamber tomb at [[Bokcheon-dong]].

From the beginning of the 15th century, the Korean government designated Busan as a trading port with the Japanese and allowed their settlement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://books.google.co.kr/books?id=Lx9WDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT58&amp;dq=Busan+as+a+trading+port+with+the+Japanese&amp;hl=nl&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjGh-7ImcPbAhWJn5QKHVDgAyoQ6AEIJjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Busan%20as%20a%20trading%20port%20with%20the%20Japanese&amp;f=false|title=Korean National Identity under Japanese Colonial Rule|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other Japanese settlements in [[Ulsan]] and [[Jinhae]] diminished later, but the Busan settlement continued until [[Japanese invasions of Korea|Japan invaded Korea in 1592]]. After the war, diplomatic relations with the new [[shogunate]] in Japan were established in 1607, and Busan was permitted to be reconstructed. The Japanese settlement, though relocated into [[Choryang]] later, continued to exist until Korea was exposed to modern diplomacy in 1876. In 1876, Busan became the first international port in Korea under the terms of the [[Treaty of Ganghwa]].

During the [[Korea under Japanese rule|Japanese rule]], Busan developed into a hub trading port with Japan. Busan was the only city in Korea to adopt the steam [[tram]]way before [[electrification]] was introduced in 1924.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://books.google.co.kr/books?id=dn-SBgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=steam+tramway+busan&amp;hl=nl&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwji4pmbmsPbAhXIVbwKHSXXCJEQ6AEIQTAE#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=The History of Korean Railway by Photographs|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Korean War, Busan was one of only two cities in South Korea not captured by the [[North Korean army]] within the [[North Korean occupation of South Korea, June to September, 1950|first three months]] of the war, the other being [[Daegu]]. As a result, the cities became refugee camp sites for Koreans during the war.&lt;ref&gt;Andrei Lankov (2010-01-31) {{cite web|url=https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/special/2010/02/113_60003.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-04-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150607135538/https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/special/2010/02/113_60003.html |archivedate=2015-06-07 |df= }} January 1951: Life of Korean War Refugees in Busan [[The Korea Times]]&lt;/ref&gt;

As Busan was one of the few areas in Korea that remained under the control of South Korea throughout the [[Korean War]], for some time it served as a temporary capital of the Republic of Korea. UN troops established a defensive perimeter around the city known as the [[Pusan Perimeter]] in the summer and autumn of 1950. Since then, the city has been a self-governing metropolis and has built a strong urban character.

In 1963, Busan separated from [[Gyeongsangnam-do]] to become a Directly Governed City (''Jikhalsi''). In 1983, the provincial capital of Gyeongsangnam-do was moved from Busan to Changwon.

In 1995, Busan became a Metropolitan City (''Gwangyeoksi'').

==Geography==
[[File:Cable Car at Geumjeong Mountain.jpg|thumb|View from Geumjeong Mountain.]]
Busan is located on the Southeastern tip of the [[Korean Peninsula]]. It is located on the coast, which determined the development of the whole city itself. It is the nearest of South Korea's six largest cities to Japan. The distance as the crow flies from Busan to [[Tsushima Island]], [[Nagasaki Prefecture]], Japan, is about {{convert|49.5|km|0|abbr=on}}, to [[Fukuoka]], Japan, about {{convert|180|km|0|abbr=on}}, and by contrast, to [[Seoul]] about {{convert|314|km|0|abbr=on}}. Busan borders low mountains on the north and west, and the seas on the south and east. The [[Nakdong River Delta]] is located on the west side of the city, and [[Geumjeongsan]], the highest mountain in the city, on the north. The [[Nakdong River]], South Korea's longest river, flows through the west and empties into the [[Korea Strait]]. The southeastern region, called [[Yeongnam]] in Korea, encompasses both [[Gyeongsang Province]]s and 3 metropolitan cities of Busan, [[Daegu]] and [[Ulsan]]. Ulsan lies northeast of Busan. Combined population exceeds 13 million.

Located on the southeasternmost tip of the [[Korean Peninsula]], Busan has a cooler version of a [[humid subtropical climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]] ''Cwa'').&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.climatestotravel.com/climate/south-korea/busan|title=Busan Climate|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Extremely high or low temperatures are rare. The highest temperature ever recorded is {{convert|37.3|C|F}} on 14 August 2016&lt;ref name=KMArecordhighs/&gt; while the lowest temperature ever recorded is {{convert|-14.0|C|F}} on 13 January 1915.&lt;ref name=KMArecordlows/&gt; May to July, late Springs and early Summers, are usually cooler than inland regions because of the ocean effect. Late Summer, and early Autumn, August and September, are generally hot and humid and the city may experience [[typhoon]]s at that time and be generally rainy. On September 15, 1959, [[Super Typhoon Sarah (1959)|Super Typhoon Sarah]] passed by the coast of the city and caused catastrophic damage. An unusually severe storm on September 12, 2003, [[Typhoon Maemi]], also caused damage to ships and buildings and resulted in over 48 fatalities.

October and November are generally the most comfortable, with clear skies and pleasant temperatures. Winters are cold and comparatively dry with high winds, but much milder than other parts of Korea except [[Jeju-do]] and several islands off the southern coast. Busan and the nearby area has the least amount of snow compared to other regions of Korea due to its location. Snow falls on an average of only about 5 days per year.&lt;ref name= KMAnormals/&gt; Even a little accumulation of snow can effectively shut down this seaport city because of the hilly terrain and unfamiliarity of motorists with driving on snow.

==Administrative divisions==
In 1957 Busan adopted a [[Administrative divisions of South Korea|division system]] with the creation of six ''[[Gu (administrative division)|gu]]'' (districts): Busanjin-gu, Dong-gu, Dongnae-gu, Jung-gu, Seo-gu, and Yeongdo-gu. Today, Busan is divided into fifteen ''gu'' and one ''[[Administrative divisions of South Korea#Gun|gun]]'' (county). Korean Statistical Information Service (KOSIS), Statistics Korea (2017)

=== Traditional cuisine ===
[[File:Korean pan cake-Dongnae pajeon-01.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A plate of a colorful pancake made with green scallions, sliced red chili pepper and chopped seafood|''Dongnae pajeon'']]
Busan was once a center of military affairs in the southern region of the peninsula and therefore was an important site for diplomatic relationships with Japan; high-ranking officers and officials from the court frequently visited the city. Special foods were prepared for the officers such as ''Dongnae pajeon'' (동래파전), a variant of ''[[pajeon]]'' (Korean savory pancakes), made with whole scallions, sliced chili peppers, and various kinds of seafood in a thick [[Batter (cooking)|batter]] of wheat flour, glutinous rice flour, eggs, salt and water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.seoul.co.kr/news/newsView.php?id=20090511010021&amp;spage=1 |script-title=ko:[내고장 이 맛!] 부산 동래파전 |publisher=Seoul.co.kr |accessdate=2011-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Korean War, Busan was the biggest refugee destination on the peninsula; people from all regions of Korea went there. Some of these refugees stayed and adapted and adjusted the recipes of their local specialties. One of these foods is ''milmyeon'' ({{Korean|밀면|labels=no}}) (lit. 'wheat noodle') a version of ''[[naengmyeon]]'', cold buckwheat noodle soup, but using wheat flour instead. (Naemyeon is originally a specialty food of [[Hamhung]] and [[Pyongyang]], now part of [[North Korea]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Kim Gi-hyeon (김기현) |date=2009-05-13 |url=http://www.munhwa.com/news/view.html?no=2009051301031343013002 |script-title=ko:동래파전·돼지국밥…음식도 관광자원으로 |publisher=[[Munhwa Ilbo]] |language=ko}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Lee Gyeong-taek (이경택) |date=2002-09-26 |url=http://www.munhwa.com/news/view.html?no=2002092601012505011003 |script-title=ko:부산AG 장외 음식열전 |language=Ko |publisher=[[Munhwa Ilbo]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;) ''Dwaeji gukbap'' ({{Korean|돼지국밥|labels=no}}) (lit.

It is a hearty pork soup and is becoming more popular nationwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Noh |first1=Ju-Seok (노주석) |date=2009-07-29 |url=http://www.seoul.co.kr/news/newsView.php?id=20090729031009&amp;spage=1 |script-title=ko:영도다리/노주석 논설위원 |language=Ko |publisher=[[Seoul Sinmun]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pork trotters served with vegetables such as cucumbers, onions, and mustard sauce is popular and is called Nangchae-[[Jokbal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.mk.co.kr/newsRead.php?no=717406&amp;year=2014|script-title=ko:서울에서 `빵 뜬` 부산 명물 먹을거리 Best 4|work=mk.co.kr|access-date=2018-04-28|language=ko}}&lt;/ref&gt;

We can find a trace of authentic Busan in the popular fishcakes at the Bupyeong Market. Fishcakes originally came from the Japanese food "Kamaboko". It is made of crushed and fried fish fillets. Busan's fishcakes have gained their reputation from their special taste. More and more people are taking food trips to Busan to taste the special fishcakes. Around 1 million travelers honor this food's history by visiting one of the famous local fishcake stores.

The history of Choryang Galbi (pork ribs) goes back to the Korean War. Back then, ordinary people gathered in the town of Choryang to have relatively cheap, but nutrient-packed pork ribs to decompress from a long day of work. Still today, around 20 galbi restaurants uphold its history and Choryang has become famous for its galbi street.

If you visit Busan, you must try the raw sliced mackerel. Around 80% of all mackerel in Korea are caught in Busan. Mackerel can easily spoil, so it is best to eat raw right after it is caught. Visitors should try the food and enjoy its fresh and delicious taste.

=== Hot spring resorts and spas ===
Busan has the largest [[hot spring]] resorts and facilities in Korea. Busan’s Oncheon is the oldest hot spring spa in Korea. It even has its own unique history, where long ago an old man with aching legs was said to have seen an injured crane come to the hot spring and bath in it. After bathing in its waters, the crane became completely cured and happily flew away. Upon seeing this, the old man also bathed his aching legs in the water and was cured. Among the hot spas, ‘Dongnae Oncheon’ and ‘Haeundae Oncheon’ are the most famous ones. Today, the spas have an outdoor bath and sauna.

The '''calculus of concepts''' is an abstract language and theory, which was developed to simplify the reasons behind effective messaging when delivered to a specific target or set of targets. The theory aims to maximize the likelihood of desired outcomes, by using messaging elements and techniques while analyzing the delivery mechanisms in certain scenarios.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cialdini|first=Robert B.|title=Influence : the psychology of persuasion|year=2007|publisher=Collins|location=New York|isbn=006124189X|edition=Rev.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reduction of uncertainty, but not its elimination, is often cost effective and practical.

Empowered by the [[Internet of Things|internet of things (IoT)]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ashton|first=Kevin|title=That 'Internet of Things' Thing - RFID Journal|url=http://www.rfidjournal.com/articles/view?4986|publisher=RFID Journal|accessdate=30 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; the framework looks at numerous device such as [[smart phones]], [[tablet computer|tablets]], [[laptops]], hand held gaming devices, GPS devices, automobile Event Data Recorders and other electronic devices as remote sensors capable of providing data channels.&lt;ref name="Hubris"&gt;{{cite web|title=Calculus of Concepts Case Study - February 2013|url=http://www.hubrisanalytics.com/case-studies/CaseStudyFeb2013.pdf|publisher=Hubris Analytics|accessdate=30 April 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130228034548/http://www.hubrisanalytics.com/case-studies/CaseStudyFeb2013.pdf#|archive-date=2013-02-28|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By using elements, the theory discovers underlying key concepts and their relations to better understand how messages can by used to elicit desired behaviors through mental model [[heuristics]] and [[biases]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Klien|first=Gary|title=Streetlights and Shadows: Searching for the Keys to Adaptive Decision Making|year=2011|publisher=MIT Press|isbn=0262516721}}&lt;/ref&gt; The framework does not serve up spam to potential consumers; it is a new paradigm for effective messaging. The nature of the data produced and consumed by devices in the IoT naturally lends itself to location-based awareness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Associati|first=Casaleggio|title=The Evolution of Internet of Things|url=http://www.casaleggio.it/pubblicazioni/Focus_internet_of_things_v1.81%20-%20eng.pdf|publisher=Casaleggio.it|accessdate=30 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Just-in-time compilation|Just-in-time]] and real-time broadcasting of key messages gives the framework an extra dimension, putting it at the forefront of behavioral methodologies. Broadcasting can take place across a number of platforms, text, photographic, video, audio or even direct human contact.

The use of anchoring-and-adjustment, framing and representativeness heuristics provides fertile grounds for “re-wiring” the decision making processes to include either positive or mitigating mental models of a given concept or set of related concepts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lopes|first=Lola L.|title=The Rhetoric of Irrationality}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The “re-wiring” will often produce results that have a significant impact on later decisions and behaviors on the target audience. The framework analyses key factors that influence the effectiveness of messaging mechanisms and how differing approaches can lead to entirely different results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Holiday|first=Ryan|title=Trust Me, I'm Lying: Confessions of a Media Manipulator|year=2012|publisher=Portfolio Hardcover|isbn=159184553X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The calculus of concepts framework has been practically implemented utilizing a combination of [[Naive Bayes]] classification&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Zhang|first=Harry|title=The Optimality of Naive Bayes|url=http://www.cs.unb.ca/profs/hzhang/publications/FLAIRS04ZhangH.pdf|publisher=University of New Brunswick|accessdate=30 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and [[Support Vector Machines]] (SVM) algorithms to actively identify the key components of a messaging campaign and its effectiveness. The effectiveness of a communications campaign is often measured by numerous results including reach, frequency and duration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Corinna Cortes|author2=Vladimir Vapnik|title=Machine Learning|date=September 1995|volume=20|issue=3|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2FBF0|accessdate=30 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The training data set for the model implementation utilized the potential messages and delivery mechanisms with Actors, Actions, Objects, Contexts and Indicia as a few examples.

Each concept within the framework is treated by the practical implementation as either an independent or dependent variable (as applicable) and therefore may have a meaningful effect on the outcome of any communication. As with any machine-learning tool the Calculus of Concepts model implementation inputs can be either nominal or ordinal and depending on the particular case.

==Practical example==
Between 2005 and 2012 one of the largest oil companies in China attempted to buy the twelfth biggest oil company in Canada. Initial proposals and takeover plans were rejected due to a number of issues surrounding political tensions.

Stakeholders identified Environment, Context, Domain, Event, Condition, State, Decision, Relation, Actor, Action and Object concepts that needed to be in place to have the key decision makers utilizing the mental models needed to secure the takeover.

Over the next 7 years messaging activities were fielded by the Chinese company and its authorized agents, specifically designed to elicit Ideations and Decisions that would result in the takeover going through. In 2012, the takeover was completed after a coordinated and concerted field messaging activity.&lt;ref name="Hubris" /&gt;

'''Carnation''' (Latin, caro, carnis, “flesh”), in [[painting]], refers to the representation of [[color]] of [[flesh]]. It is also used in describing a painting or [[drawing]] to signify the undraped parts of a figure.

==Usage==
The use of carnation requires very attentive study and great skill in the painter. It varies with the sex of the individual, with the classes and countries to which the subjects belong, with the passions, the state of the health, etc. The [[cheek]]s are, in a healthy subject, of a lively red; the [[breast]], [[neck]] and upper part of the arms of a soft white; the belly yellowish. At the extremities the color becomes colder, and at the points assumes a [[violet (color)|violet]] tint, on account of the [[transparency and translucency|transparency]] of the skin. All these shades require to be softly blended. Two faults in carnation are chiefly to be avoided: hardness, the fault of the masters of the 15th century, and too great weakness. [[Guido Reni]] not infrequently painted his flesh so that it appeared almost bloodless. The French school has gone farthest in this respect. The flesh of the followers of this school often looks like [[porcelain]] or [[wax]]. [[Titian]] and [[Peter Paul Rubens|Rubens]] are unrivaled in their rendering of carnation.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8981">The '''conservation and restoration of outdoor murals''' is the process of caring for and maintaining [[mural]]s, and includes documentation, examination, research, and treatment to insure their long-term viability, when desired.

== History ==

[[Mural]]s are most commonly defined as wall paintings, works of art integrated into a specific architectural space.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Newsletter 18.2 Summer 2003|url = http://www.getty.edu/conservation/publications_resources/newsletters/18_2/feature.html|website = www.getty.edu|accessdate = 2015-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word ''mural'' is derived from the Latin word ''murus'', meaning wall. Walls have long provided a direct support for aesthetic, political, and social ideas expressed with paint. Cave paintings could be considered the earliest murals, followed over time by wall paintings in tombs, temples, churches, civic buildings, and a variety of outdoor spaces.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Newsletter 18.2 Summer 2003|url = http://www.getty.edu/conservation/publications_resources/newsletters/18_2/feature.html|website = www.getty.edu|accessdate = 2015-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern murals grow out of this long tradition. From the beginning of the 20th century, murals have had a significant presence in the architecture of the Americas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Newsletter 18.2 Summer 2003|url = http://www.getty.edu/conservation/publications_resources/newsletters/18_2/feature.html|website = www.getty.edu|accessdate = 2015-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through the years murals have changed just as everyday life has changed. Murals were painted on church walls and carved into stone or wood on the outside, to educate those who cannot read.  The tradition has carried on to today’s churches. Visual images and language are one of the most powerful forms of communication, both then and more so now.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Perspective Realia - History of Murals|url = http://www.art.utah.edu/murals/What_We_Do/History_of_Murals.html|website = www.art.utah.edu|accessdate = 2015-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Murals today share much of the history from past murals, though today’s murals can depict anything. The major job of murals today is to band communities together. In an age where everything is materialistic, and most of us don’t know our neighbors let alone anyone else in our community, finding a way to bring people together can be difficult. Murals have a very positive effect on communities, bring people together and bring pride to the community, and that pride tends to stay and spread to other parts of the community.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Perspective Realia - History of Murals|url = http://www.art.utah.edu/murals/What_We_Do/History_of_Murals.html|website = www.art.utah.edu|accessdate = 2015-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Deterioration  ==

Outdoor contemporary murals are generally seen as temporary installation, varying from 10 to 20 years due to weathering and vandalism. Outdoor murals are susceptible to, depending on their physical location, extreme weather conditions. A few of the biggest problems facing murals are graffiti, physical destruction, and desaturation as the paint layers weather and are exposed to UV. UV radiation causes cracking, color change and fading. Oxidation chain reactions are the culprit on a chemical level.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.conservators-converse.org/2012/05/40th-annual-meeting-architecture-session-may-10-preservation-of-outdoor-public-murals-research-and-public-outreach-by-amanda-norbutus/|title = AIC's Annual Meeting » AIC’s 40th Annual Meeting – Architecture Session, May 10, "Preservation of Outdoor Public Murals: Research and Public Outreach" by Amanda Norbutus|date = May 21, 2012|accessdate = November 25, 2015|website = The American Institute for Conservation of Historic and Artistic Works|publisher = |last = Norbutus|first = Amanda}}&lt;/ref&gt; Environmental conditions are a major factor in mural deterioration. Freeze-thaw cycles and capillary rise affect the architectural support of the mural and lead to salt efflorescence, cracking, and lifting of the paint layers if incompatible paints or coatings are used and the mural extends to ground level.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Newsletter 18.2 Summer 2003|url = http://www.getty.edu/conservation/publications_resources/newsletters/18_2/feature.html|website = www.getty.edu|accessdate = 2015-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Murals that face South in direct UV rays are susceptible to fade and also binder deterioration.

== Conservation ==
Murals are traditionally commissioned on private buildings and structures, leaving ownership of the mural in the hands of the owner of the building. Gaining permission to conduct conservation is a key first step in the process. Annual inspections of mural will contribute to it lifetime. Inspections are encouraged to take place during the spring season. This will allow for any damage done during the winter months to not be overseen, and will also allow for conservation to being and take place during the summer.

=== Preventive conservation ===
Preventive conservation can take place before a mural begins. Such as preparing the wall properly and using high-quality, lightfast, and compatible materials—is fundamental. Other preventive actions (e.g., regular maintenance, graffiti removal, and community awareness) can help preserve murals. Much of the damage seen on murals is due to vandalism and a lack of maintenance. Sadly, regular maintenance is not always a priority.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Newsletter 18.2 Summer 2003|url = http://www.getty.edu/conservation/publications_resources/newsletters/18_2/feature.html|website = www.getty.edu|accessdate = 2015-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Building maintenance is also important to the life of the mural. Communities are aware of well-respected buildings, community engagement is important to continue to spread the word about preserving the sight of the mural. Continue to maintain the grounds that the building reside on. A well maintained building will deter vandalism and also [[litter]]ing around the property. These are all preventive steps that can me undertaken by the community at large, contributing to the murals dialog of bringing a community together.

=== Graffiti ===
[[Graffiti]] plagues the presence of many murals, especially those found within city limits. Graffiti is often seen as a form of territory, and once it premiers on a location it invites others to participate in the act of vandalism. Involving the youth of the community with mural project directly is seen as a way to prevent future graffiti, giving them a profound connection and education with and about the project.

If graffiti is present on a mural, it must be removed in a safe and effective manner that does not directly harm the image beneath it. For this reason, removal should be undertaken by a conservator or an artist/technician familiar with the piece after consultation with or under the supervision of a conservator. Removal without adequate testing, or by an individual without adequate experience or supervision, can irreparably harm the mural.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Caring for an Existing Mural|url = https://www.cci-icc.gc.ca/resources-ressources/objectscollectionsobjets/art/murals-murales/caring-eng.aspx|website = www.cci-icc.gc.ca|accessdate = 2015-12-11|last = 29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Treatment ===
As murals deteriorate, owners and agencies have several treatment options. They may ask the artist to repaint or restore the work, or they may call a conservator who could either treat the mural according to strict conservation guidelines or work with the artist to conserve and possibly restore the work. With contemporary murals, there are many instances of restoration or even re-creation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Newsletter 18.2 Summer 2003|url = http://www.getty.edu/conservation/publications_resources/newsletters/18_2/feature.html|website = www.getty.edu|accessdate = 2015-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before this takes place it is advised to look back for an existing plan set out before the mural project began planning the steps of its conservation, if and when needed. This document should articulate who will be the lead of the project; conservator, artist, committee etc. and will also state who will approve the conservation work need to be performed. 

A conservator should ideally perform the analysis of the state of the mural and outline procedures and materials need to be performed. This should all then be taken into consideration with the expectations of the community and also the owner of the mural (owner of the building).

A conversation piece by [[Arthur Devis (1712–1787)|Arthur Devis]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.artfund.org/supporting-museums/art-weve-helped-buy/artwork/3921/sir-george-and-lady-strickland-in-the-grounds-of-boynton-hall-arthur-devis&lt;/ref&gt;]]
A '''conversation piece''' is an informal group [[portrait]], especially those painted in [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Britain]] in the 18th century, beginning in the 1720s. They are distinguished by their portrayal of the group apparently engaged in genteel conversation or some activity, very often outdoors. Typically the group will be members of a family, but friends may be included, and some groups are of friends, members of a society or hunt, or some other grouping.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/glossary/conversation-piece Glossary: Conversation Piece.] The National Gallery. Retrieved 7 December 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Often the paintings are relatively small, about the same size as a half-length portrait but in horizontal or "landscape" format; others are much larger.

==Origins==
[[File:Johan Zoffany - Tribuna of the Uffizi - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|[[Johann Zoffany]] paints a group of Englishmen in Rome for the [[Grand Tour]], united only by their wealth and love of art; unlike most conversation pieces, this was not a commissioned work.]]
The genre was developed from 17th century portraiture in the [[Low Countries]].&lt;ref&gt;[[William Gaunt (art historian)|Gaunt, William]]. (1964) ''A concise history of English painting''. London: [[Thames and Hudson]], p. 58. {{ISBN|0500200165}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The  compositions of merrymaking companies (''vrolijk gezelschap'') and garden parties (''buitenpartij'') painted by artists such as [[Dirck Hals]], [[David Vinckbooms]], [[Adriaen van de Venne]] and [[Willem Buytewech]] were an important influence on the genre.  In addition, representations of elegant companies and balls by [[Hieronymus Janssens]] and the works of [[Peter Paul Rubens]], in particular his ''[[The Garden of Love (Rubens)|Garden of Love]]'' ([[Prado Museum]]), gave an impetus and direction to the development of the genre.  In this last work, Rubens showed how a garden could be used as a setting for amorous dalliance and courtship.&lt;ref&gt;Mary Tavener, ''Nicolas Lancret: Dance Before a Fountain'', Holmes Getty Publications, p. 13-14&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Low Countries many group portraits were painted, both of family groups and groups such as Governors or Regents of institutions, or militia officers. [[Frans Hals]], [[Rembrandt]] and other artists had adopted a variety of poses to liven up the group portrait, for example the famous ''[[Night Watch (painting)|Night Watch]]''.  The name derives from the Italian term, also used in English, ''[[sacra conversazione]]'' for a similarly informal painting of the [[Virgin and Child]] with saints, a genre developed in the Renaissance.

==Varieties==
There are many varieties of conversation piece. People may be portrayed sharing common activities such as hunts, meals, or musical parties. Dogs and/or horses are also frequently featured. [[Arthur Devis (1712–1787)|Arthur Devis]] was a regional painter famous for his small conversation pieces, popular with the gentry of [[Cheshire]]. [[William Hogarth]] also worked in the genre, and parodied it in his print ''A Midnight Modern Conversation'', which depicted a group of men whose conversation has degenerated into drunken incoherence. [[Johann Zoffany]] specialized in complicated conversation pieces, and most portraits by [[George Stubbs]] take this form, with horses and carriages in the composition. [[Joshua Reynolds]] would on request produce conversation pieces in the [[Grand Manner]], and at his usual near-life scale.

==Conversation starters==
The phrase "conversation piece" later acquired a different meaning. It came to refer to objects that were perceived to be interesting enough to spark conversation about them. They provide a stimulus for prop-based [[conversation opener]]s. The original conversation pieces sometimes depicted a group united in conversation about an object, which would typically be an item linked to science or scholarship.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

The '''Crosby Garrett Helmet''' is a [[List of copper alloys|copper alloy]] [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] cavalry helmet dating from the late 2nd or early 3rd century [[Anno Domini|AD]]. It was found by an unnamed [[Metal detector#Archaeology|metal detectorist]] near [[Crosby Garrett]] in [[Cumbria]], England, in May 2010. Later investigations found that a Romano-British farming settlement had occupied the site where the helmet was discovered, which was located a few miles away from a [[Roman road]] and a [[Roman army]] fort. It is possible that the owner of the helmet was a local inhabitant who had served with the Roman cavalry.

The helmet appears to have been deliberately folded up and deposited in an artificial stone structure. It is thought to have been used for ceremonial occasions rather than for combat, and may already have been an antique by the time it was buried. It is of the same type as the [[Newstead Helmet]] (found in 1905) and its design also has similarities with the [[Ribchester Helmet]] (found in 1796) and the [[Hallaton Helmet]] (found in 2000), though its facial features are more akin to those of helmets found in southern Europe. Its design may allude to the [[Trojan War|Trojans]], whose exploits the Romans re-enacted in cavalry tournaments.

Dr Ralph Jackson, Senior Curator of Romano-British Collections at the [[British Museum]], has described the helmet as "...&amp;nbsp;an immensely interesting and outstandingly important find&amp;nbsp;... Its face mask is both extremely finely wrought and chillingly striking, but it is as an ensemble that the helmet is so exceptional and, in its specifics, unparalleled. It is a find of the greatest national (and, indeed, international) significance."&lt;ref name="jackson"&gt;{{Cite web | last=Jackson | first=Ralph | title=Roman Cavalry Sports helmet from Crosby Garrett, Cumbria |work=[[Portable Antiquities Scheme]]| url=http://www.finds.org.uk/documents/file/rjReport.pdf | date=9 September 2010 | accessdate=14 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 7 October 2010, the helmet was sold at [[Christie's]] for £2.3&amp;nbsp;million (US$3.6&amp;nbsp;million) to an undisclosed private buyer. [[Tullie House Museum and Art Gallery]] in [[Carlisle, Cumbria|Carlisle]] sought to purchase the helmet with the support of the British Museum, but was outbid. The helmet has so far been publicly displayed four times, once in a 2012 exhibition at the [[Royal Academy of Arts]], at Tullie House in 2013–14, followed by display at the British Museum in 2014. The helmet returned to Tullie House to be displayed in the Hadrian's Cavalry exhibition in the summer of 2017.

==Description==
[[File:Crosby Garret Helmet at Sale.jpg|left|thumb|The helmet on display at [[Christie's]] in 2010]]
The Crosby Garrett helmet is an almost complete example of a two-piece Roman cavalry helmet. The visor portrays the face of a youthful, clean-shaven male with curly hair. The headpiece is in the shape of a [[Phrygian cap]], on the crest of which is a winged [[griffin]] that stands with one raised foot resting on an [[amphora]]. The visor was originally attached to the headpiece by means of a hinge; the iron hinge pin has not survived, but its existence has been inferred from the presence of powdery deposits of iron oxide residue. The helmet would have been held in place using a leather strap attached from the wearer's neck to a decorated rivet on either side of the helmet, below the ear. Wear marks caused by opening and closing the visor are still visible, and at some point the helmet was repaired using a bronze sheet which was riveted across two splits.&lt;ref name="British Archaeology"&gt;{{cite journal | author1=Worrell, Sally | author2=Jackson, Ralph | author3=Mackay, Andrew | author4=Bland, Roger | author5=Pitts, Mike | title=The Crosby Garrett Roman Helmet | url=http://www.archaeologyuk.org/ba/ba116/feat1.shtml | journal=[[British Archaeology]] | date=Jan–Feb 2011 | issue=116 | accessdate=3 March 2011 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6F06b27LA?url=http://www.archaeologyuk.org/ba/ba116/feat1.shtml | archivedate=9 March 2013 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Only two other Roman helmets complete with visors have been found in Britain – the Newstead Helmet and Ribchester Helmet.&lt;ref name="Christie's" /&gt;

The helmet and visor were cast from an alloy consisting of an average of 82% [[copper]], 10% [[zinc]] and 8% [[tin]]. This alloy was probably derived from melted-down scrap [[brass]] with a low zinc content, with which some tin had been added to improve the quality of the casting.&lt;ref name="British Archaeology" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pas" /&gt; Some of the fragments show traces of a white metal coating, indicating that the visor would originally have been [[Tinning|tinned]] to give the appearance of silver.&lt;ref name="pas"&gt;{{cite web | last=Worrell | first=Sally | title=LANCUM-E48D73 HELMET  |url=http://www.finds.org.uk/database/artefacts/record/id/404767 | work=[[Portable Antiquities Scheme]] | accessdate=13 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The griffin was cast separately from a different alloy consisting of 68% copper, 4% zinc, 18% tin and 10% [[lead]]. The visor would originally have been a silver hue and the helmet would have had a coppery yellow appearance.&lt;ref name="British Archaeology" /&gt; The helmet's creation can be dated to the late 2nd or early 3rd century from the use of a particular type of decorated rivet as well as some of its design features, such as its pierced eyes.&lt;ref name="CA-Feb2014" /&gt;

There has been much debate about the symbolic meaning of the helmet's design. The griffin was the companion of [[Nemesis (mythology)|Nemesis]], the goddess of vengeance and fate. They were both seen as agents of death and were often linked with gladiatorial combat.&lt;ref name="jackson" /&gt; The meaning of the face and headpiece are less clearly identifiable. Suggestions have ranged from the Greek god [[Attis]] and the hero [[Perseus]], to the Roman gods [[Mithras]] and [[Jupiter Dolichenus]], to a more general Eastern Mediterranean appearance that could possibly have been meant to suggest a [[Troy|Trojan]] identity.&lt;ref name="British Archaeology" /&gt; The Phrygian cap was often used by the Romans as a visual motif representing the Trojans.&lt;ref name="CA-Feb2014" /&gt;

==Discovery and restoration==
[[File:Crosby Helmet Side view.jpg|thumb|160px|Side view of the helmet.]]
The helmet and visor were found in May 2010 in pastureland on a farm owned by Eric Robinson at Crosby Garrett in Cumbria. The finder, an unnamed metal detectorist in his 20s from [[Peterlee]], [[County Durham]], had been detecting with his father in two adjacent fields for some years but had previously only discovered some [[Roman currency|Roman coins]] and other small artefacts. The findspot is situated not far from a Roman road. A number of earthworks are located nearby, indicating the presence of a previously unrecorded ancient settlement.&lt;ref name="British Archaeology" /&gt; The area was strategically placed on the route to the northern frontier of Roman Britain within the territory of the [[Carvetii]] tribe. The [[Roman army]] would have been present in the area and would certainly have used the nearby road. A Roman auxiliary fort stood only {{convert|9|km}} to the north-east at [[Verterae]] ([[Brough Castle]]).&lt;ref name="CA-Feb2014"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Crosby Garrett - Exploring the helmet's burial place|last=Symonds|first=Matthew|date=February 2014|journal=Current Archaeology|pages=12–17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the helmet's discovery, the area around the findspot was investigated in a project sponsored by the Tullie House Museum and Art Gallery and the [[Portable Antiquities Scheme]]. The earthworks noted earlier were found to be part of a substantial enclosure surrounded by ditches, within which buildings had once stood. The enclosure, which measures as much as {{convert|500|m}} long on its southern side, combines both native British and Roman methods of fortification. A sunken area within the enclosure may possibly have served as a [[paddock]] for horses, while the evidence for the buildings is concentrated in the enclosure's northern portion. The remnants of Romano-British field systems in the surrounding area show that the area was under cultivation and animal remains found on the site indicate that the inhabitants also raised livestock, including sheep, goats and pigs. The presence of Roman pottery suggests that the inhabitants had adopted some elements of the Roman lifestyle, but their community may well have been there long before the Romans arrived. Archaeological evidence from the enclosure indicates that the site may have been first settled as far back as the [[Bronze Age Britain|Bronze Age]], at least 1,000 years before the helmet was deposited.&lt;ref name="CA-Feb2014" /&gt;

The finder discovered the helmet and visor buried together some 25&amp;nbsp;cm (10&amp;nbsp;in) below the surface,&lt;ref name="British Archaeology" /&gt; at a site located on a ledge at the lower end of the settlement. It had been placed onto two stone slabs at the bottom of a hole which had been back-filled with soil. A stone cap had been laid on top.&lt;ref name="CA-Feb2014" /&gt; The helmet was found in 33 large fragments and 34 small fragments&lt;ref name="pas" /&gt; and had apparently been folded before burial. The visor was mostly intact and had been placed face down. The griffin had become detached and was found with the helmet.&lt;ref name="British Archaeology" /&gt; No other artefacts were found at the time, but the subsequent Tullie House/PAS excavations at the findspot discovered a number of copper and iron objects, a bead and two Roman coins dating to 330–337. The coins were found within the artificial stone feature in which the helmet had been deposited and may have been buried at the same time.&lt;ref name="CA-Feb2014" /&gt;

The finder did not initially realise that he had found a Roman artefact and thought at first that it was a [[Victorian decorative arts|Victorian ornament]]. He eventually identified it as Roman by consulting auction catalogues, searching the Internet and getting advice from dealers. Find Liaison Officers from the Portable Antiquities Scheme were notified of the discovery and visited the findspot along with the finder. Christie's commissioned Darren Bradbury, an independent conservator and restorer, to restore the helmet and visor for sale.&lt;ref name="British Archaeology" /&gt; Although Christie's was asked to delay the restoration so that a full scientific examination could be carried out, this request was not granted and information about the helmet's burial may have been lost as a result.&lt;ref name="guardian"&gt;{{Cite news | last=Kennedy | first=Maev | title=Roman cavalry helmet found with metal detector may go abroad at auction | url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2010/sep/13/roman-helmet-metal-detector-cumbria | work=[[The Guardian]] |location=London | date=13 September 2010 | accessdate=13 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the British Museum was able to inspect the find during restoration and [[X-ray fluorescence]] spectrometry was carried out to determine the composition of the headpiece, visor and griffin. Bradbury's restoration work took some 240 hours and involved the repair of cracks and holes using [[resin]] and [[cyanoacrylate]] ("Super Glue") , retouched to match the appearance of the surrounding material.&lt;ref name="British Archaeology" /&gt;

==Similarities and usage==

The helmet and visor have marked similarities to a number of other Roman cavalry helmets. The visor is a cavalry sports type C (H. Russell Robinson classification) or type V (Maria Kohlert classification). Similar examples have been found across the [[Roman Empire]] from [[Roman Britain|Britain]] to [[Syria]]. It is of the same type as the [[Newstead Helmet]], found in [[Scotland]] in 1905, and its facial features most closely parallel a helmet that was found at [[Nola]] in [[Italy]] and is now in the [[British Museum]]. The rendering of the hair is similar to that of a type C helmet found at [[Belgrade]] in [[Serbia]] and dated to the 2nd century AD.&lt;ref name="Christie's"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.christies.com/LotFinder/lot_details.aspx?from=searchresults&amp;intObjectID=5358441&amp;sid=f7bc10b5-59f1-41fd-91f9-5c2b2b53ec7d |title=A Roman Bronze Cavalry Parade Helmet | work=Christie's | date=September 2010 | accessdate=3 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pas" /&gt; The griffin ornament is unique, though it may parallel a lost "sphinx of bronze" that may originally have been attached to the crest of the [[Ribchester Helmet]], discovered in [[Lancashire]] in 1796. The headpiece is nearly unique; only one other example in the form of a Phrygian cap has been found, in a fragmentary state, at [[Ostrov, Constanţa|Ostrov]] in [[Romania]], dated to the second half of the 2nd century AD. Rings on the back of the helmet and on the griffin may have been used to attach colourful streamers or ribbons.&lt;ref name="Christie's" /&gt;

Such helmets were used for ''[[hippika gymnasia]]'', cavalry tournaments that were performed in front of emperors and senior commanders. Horses and riders wore lavishly decorated clothes, armour and plumes while performing feats of horsemanship and re-enacting historical and legendary battles, such as the wars of the Greeks and Trojans.&lt;ref name="British Archaeology" /&gt; According to the Roman writer [[Arrian]]:

{{quote|[T]hose of high rank or superior in horsemanship wear gilded helmets of iron or bronze to draw the attention of the spectators. Unlike the helmets made for active service, these do not cover the head and cheeks only but are made to fit all round the faces of the riders with apertures for the eyes&amp;nbsp;... From the helmets hang yellow plumes, a matter of décor as much as utility. As the horses move forward, the slightest breeze adds to the beauty of these plumes.— Arrian, ''Ars Tactica'' 34&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last=Webster | first=Graham | title=The Roman Imperial Army of the First and Second Centuries A.D. | publisher=University of Oklahoma Press | year=1998 | isbn=978-0-8061-3000-2 | page=156 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Combat gear was issued by and belonged to the Roman army, and had to be returned at the end of a wearer's service. Cavalry sports equipment appears to have been treated differently, as soldiers apparently privately commissioned and purchased it for their own use. They evidently retained it after they completed their service. Both helmets and visors have been found in graves and other contexts away from obvious military sites, as well as being deposited in forts and their vicinity.&lt;ref name="British Archaeology" /&gt; In some cases they were carefully folded up and buried, as in the case of the [[Guisborough Helmet]]. The Dutch historian Johan Nicolay has identified a "lifecycle" for Roman military equipment in which ex-soldiers took certain items home with them as a reminder of their service and occasionally disposed of them away from garrison sites as grave goods or votive offerings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Nicolay |first=Johan|title=Armed Batavians: Use and Significance of Weaponry and Horse Gear from Non-military Contexts in the Rhine Delta, 50 BC to AD 450|publisher=Amsterdam University Press|year=2007|isbn=978-90-5356-253-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The circumstances in which the Crosby Garret helmet was buried are still unclear, but the discoveries made by the post-discovery Tullie House/PAS excavations have provided much more detail about its context. It was clearly deposited within an artificial feature that had been specially constructed; Stuart Noon of the [[Museum of Lancashire]] suggests that the feature may have been intended as a memorial of some sort. It was not buried in an isolated spot but within a long-occupied Romano-British farming settlement that had clearly adopted aspects of Roman culture. Given the settlement's proximity to Roman military locations, it is very possible that some of its inhabitants served with the Roman army, which often recruited mounted auxiliaries from among native peoples. The helmet may well already have been a valuable antique at the time of its burial; if the coins found nearby reflect when it was buried, it could have been over a century old by the time it was deposited. It was deliberately broken before being buried in what may have been intended as a ritual sacrifice. The identity of its owner will never be known, but it could have been that a local inhabitant who had formerly served with the Roman cavalry was responsible for the helmet's deposition.&lt;ref name="CA-Feb2014" /&gt;

==Auction and controversy==
[[File:Crosby Garrett Helmet on auction at Christies.jpg|thumb|220px|right|The helmet on auction at Christie's auction house in London on 7 October 2010]]
Although the find was reported under the Portable Antiquities Scheme, it was not declared treasure under the [[1996 Treasure Act]] because single items of non-precious metal are not covered by the act. The finder and landowner were thus free to dispose of the helmet as they saw fit. The discovery was publicly announced by Christie's in mid-September 2010; the helmet was the centrepiece of its 7 October auction catalogue, featuring on the cover and six more pages. Its value was put at £200,000 – £300,000 ($309,200 – $463,800). The Tullie House Museum and Art Gallery launched an appeal with the aim of purchasing the helmet and making it the focus of a new Roman frontier gallery due to open in 2011. The campaign immediately attracted numerous donations, including £50,000 from an anonymous overseas benefactor who offered the sum if a matching sum could be raised by the public (it was); a £1 million offer from the [[National Heritage Memorial Fund]]; a £300,000 pledge from the Headley Trust and the Monument Trust; £200,000 from the [[Art Fund]]; and £75,000 from the [[John Paul Getty, Jr.|J Paul Getty Jr Charitable Trust]]. By the time of the auction three and a half weeks after the campaign had been launched, the museum had raised enough money to support a bid of up to £1.7 million. Behind the scenes, efforts were made to persuade the finder and landowner to agree a private sale with the museum, but these approaches failed.&lt;ref name="British Archaeology" /&gt;

The initial estimate was passed within seconds of the auction opening. Six bidders pushed the price towards a million pounds and Tullie House was forced to drop out at £1.7 million. Two remaining bidders took the bid past £2 million; the winning bidder, an anonymous UK resident and fine art collector bidding by phone, paid a total of £2,330,468.75 including the buyer's premium and [[VAT]]. The outcome aroused controversy and prompted calls for the Treasure Act to be revised, though ''[[British Archaeology]]'' noted that the circumstances of the helmet's discovery may have resulted in it being outside the scope of even a revised act.&lt;ref name="British Archaeology" /&gt; It is still possible that the helmet could come into public ownership; if the winning bidder wishes to export it, an export licence would have to be applied for and if a temporary export bar was placed on it an opportunity could arise for funds to be raised by a public institution to purchase the helmet.&lt;ref name="The Independent"&gt;{{Cite news | last=Barnes| first=Anthony | title=Roman helmet found in field sells for £2.3m | url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/roman-helmet-found-in-field-sells-for-23m-2100601.html | work=[[The Independent]] | date=7 October 2010 | accessdate=7 October 2010 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Display==
Since its sale in 2010, the helmet has been on public display four times. It was lent by its owner to the [[Royal Academy of Arts]] in London, and was put on display from 15 September to 9 December 2012 as part of an exhibition of bronzes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title=Crosby Garrett Helmet to be part of Royal Academy exhibition | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-cumbria-19536363 | work=[[BBC News]] | date=9 September 2012 | accessdate=9 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  From 1 November 2013 until 26 January 2014 the helmet was on display at the [[Tullie House Museum and Art Gallery]] in [[Carlisle, Cumbria|Carlisle]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tulliehouse.co.uk/events/crosby-garrett-roman-helmet-exhibition|title=Crosby Garrett Roman Helmet exhibition|date=|accessdate=13 November 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131113122538/http://www.tulliehouse.co.uk/events/crosby-garrett-roman-helmet-exhibition|archivedate=13 November 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a printed guide was produced for the occasion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor-last1=Breeze|editor-first1=D.J.|editor-last2=Bishop|editor-first2=M.C.|title=The Crosby Garrett Helmet|location=Pewsey|publisher=The Armatura Press, for Tullie House Museum &amp; Art Gallery|year=2013|isbn=978-0-9570261-7-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was subsequently displayed at the British Museum from 28 January to 27 April 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/whats_on/past_exhibitions/2014/roman_war_games.aspx|title=Roman war games: helmets from Crosby Garrett and Ribchester|publisher=British Museum|accessdate=28 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The helmet returned to Tullie House to be part of their exhibition for Hadrian's Cavalry, an exhibition spanning ten sites along Hadrian's Wall from April to September 2017.

'''Cued Speech''' is a visual system of communication used with and among [[deaf]] or [[deafness|hard-of-hearing]] people. It is a phonemic-based system which makes traditionally spoken languages accessible by using a small number of [[handshape]]s, known as cues (representing [[consonant]]s), in different locations near the mouth (representing [[vowel]]s), as a supplement to [[speechreading]]. The National Cued Speech Association defines Cued Speech as "...a visual mode of communication that uses hand shapes and placements in combination with the mouth movements and speech to make the phonemes of spoken language look different from each other." It adds information about the [[phonology]] of the word that is not visible on the lips. This allows people with hearing or language difficulties to visually access the fundamental properties of language.  It is now used with people with a variety of language, speech, communication, and learning needs. It is different from American Sign Language (ASL), which is a separate language from English. Cued Speech is considered a communication modality, but can be used as a strategy to support auditory rehabilitation, speech articulation, and literacy development.

==History==
Cued Speech was invented in 1966 by [[R. Orin Cornett]] at [[Gallaudet University|Gallaudet College]], [[Washington, D.C.]]&lt;ref name="All Good Things Pg 1"&gt;"All Good Things...Gallaudet closes Cued Speech Team", ''Cued Speech News'' Vol. XXVII No. 4 (Final Issue) Winter 1994: Pg 1&lt;/ref&gt; After discovering that children with prelingual and profound [[hearing impairment]]s typically have poor [[reading comprehension]], he developed the system with the aim of improving the reading abilities of such children through better comprehension of the [[phoneme]]s of English. At the time, some were arguing that deaf children were earning these lower marks because they had to learn two different systems: American Sign Language (ASL) for person-to-person communication and English for reading and writing.&lt;ref name="Cued Speech offers"&gt;https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/09/27/AR2010092705382.html&lt;/ref&gt; As many sounds look identical on the lips (such as {{IPA|/p/}} and {{IPA|/b/}}), the hand signals introduce a visual contrast in place of the formerly acoustic contrast. Cued Speech may also help people hearing incomplete or distorted sound—according to the National Cued Speech Association at cuedspeech.org, "[[cochlear implant]]s and Cued Speech are powerful partners".{{Citation needed|date=July 2016}}

Since cued speech is based on making sounds visible to the hearing impaired, cued speech is not limited to use in English speaking nations. Because of the demand for use in other languages/countries, by 1994 Cornett had adapted cueing to 25 other languages and dialects.&lt;ref name="All Good Things Pg 1"/&gt;  Originally designed to represent [[American English]], the system was adapted to [[French language|French]] in 1977. {{As of|2005}}, Cued Speech has been adapted to approximately 60 languages and dialects, including six [[dialects of English]]. For [[Tone (linguistics)|tonal languages]] such as [[Thai language|Thai]], the tone is indicated by inclination and movement of the hand. For English, Cued Speech uses eight different hand shapes and four different positions around the mouth.{{Citation needed|date=July 2016}}

==Nature and use==
Though to a hearing person, Cued Speech may look similar to signing, Cued Speech is not a [[sign language]]; nor is it a [[Manually coded language|Manually Coded Sign System]] for a spoken language. Rather, Cued Speech is a manual modality of communication for representing any language at the phonological level ([[phonetics]]).

A manual cue in cued speech consists of two components: hand shape and hand position relative to the face. Hand shapes distinguish consonants and hand positions distinguish vowel. A hand shape and a hand position (a "cue") together with the accompanying mouthshape, makes up a CV unit - a basic syllable.&lt;ref&gt;Heracleous, P. Beautemps, D. &amp; Aboutabit, N. (2010). Cued speech automatic recognition in normal-hearing and deaf subjects. ''Speech Communication,'' 52, 504–512.&lt;/ref&gt;

Cuedspeech.org lists 64 different dialects that CS has been adapted to.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cuedspeech.org/cued-speech-in-different-languages&lt;/ref&gt;  Each language takes on CS by looking through the catalog of the language's phonemes and distinguishing which phonemes appear similar when pronounced and thus need a hand sign to differentiate them.{{Citation needed|date=July 2016}}

==Literacy==
Cued Speech is based on the hypothesis that if all the sounds in the spoken language looked clearly different from each other on the lips of the speaker, those hearing impaired would learn a language in much the same way as a hearing person, but through vision rather than audition.&lt;ref name="Cornett"&gt;Cued Speech: What and Why?, R. Orin Cornett, Ph.D., undated white paper.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sweden"&gt;Proceedings of the International Congress on Education of the Deaf, Stockholm, Sweden 1970, Vol. 1, pp. 97-99&lt;/ref&gt;

Literacy is the ability to read and write proficiently, which allows one to understand and communicate ideas so as to participate in a literate society.
Cued speech was designed to help eliminate the difficulties of English language acquisition and literacy development in children who are deaf or hard-of-hearing. Results of research show that accurate and consistent cueing with a child can help in the development of language, communication and literacy but why is this so important and how does it happen? This paper addresses the issues behind literacy development, traditional deaf education, and how using cued speech makes such a difference in the lives of children.

Cued speech does indeed achieve its goal of distinguishing phonemes received by the learner, but there is some question of whether it is as helpful to expression as it is to reception.  An article by Jacqueline Leybaert and Jesús Alegría discusses how children who are introduced to cued speech before the age of one are up to speed with their hearing peers on receptive vocabulary, though expressive vocabulary lags behind.&lt;ref name=leybaert&gt;Leybaert, J., &amp; Alegría, J. (1990). [http://www.cuedspeech.org/pdfs/journal/vol4-4.pdf Cued Speech and the acquisition of reading by deaf children]. Cued speech journal, 4, 25-37.&lt;/ref&gt;  The writers suggest additional and separate training to teach oral expression if such is desired, but more importantly this reflects the nature of cued speech; to adapt the hearing-impaired to a hearing world, as such discontinuities of expression and reception are not as commonly found for hearing-impaired children learning sign language.&lt;ref name=leybaert/&gt;

In her paper "The Relationship Between Phonological Coding And Reading Achievement In Deaf Children: Is Cued Speech A Special Case?" (1998), Ostrander notes, "Research has consistently shown a link between lack of phonological awareness and reading disorders (Jenkins &amp; Bowen, 1994)" and discusses the research basis for teaching cued speech as an aid to phonological awareness and literacy.&lt;ref&gt;http://web.syr.edu/~clostran/literacy.html {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060503173056/http://web.syr.edu/~clostran/literacy.html |date=2006-05-03 }} "The Relationship Between Phonological Coding And Reading Achievement In Deaf Children: Is Cued Speech A Special 
Case?" Carolyn Ostrander, 1998 (accessed August 23, 2006)&lt;/ref&gt; Ostrander concludes that further research into these areas is needed and well justified.{{Citation needed|date=July 2016}}

The editor of the ''Cued Speech Journal'' reports that "Research indicating that Cued Speech does greatly improve the reception of spoken language by profoundly deaf children was reported in 1979 by Gaye Nicholls, and in 1982 by Nicholls and Ling."&lt;ref&gt;Editor Carol J. Boggs, Ph.D, "Editor's Notes", ''Cued Speech Journal'', (1990) Vol 4,  pg ii&lt;/ref&gt;

In the book "Choices in Deafness: A Parents' Guide to Communication Options", Sue Schwartz writes on how Cued Speech helps a deaf child recognize pronunciation. The child can learn how to pronounce words such as "hors d'oeuvre" or "tamale" or "Hermione" that have pronunciations different from how they are spelled. A child can learn about accents and dialects. In New York, coffee may be pronounced "caw fee"; in the South, the word friend ("fray-end") can be a two-syllable word.&lt;ref&gt;Sue Schwartz, Ph.D, Choices in Deafness: A Parents' Guide to Communication Options&lt;/ref&gt;

==Debate over cued speech ''vs'' sign language==
The topic of deaf education has long been filled with controversy.  There are two strategies for teaching the deaf that exist: an aural/oral approach or a manual approach.  Those who use aural-oralism believe that children who are deaf or hard-of-hearing should be taught through the use of residual hearing, speech and speechreading.  Those promoting a manual approach believe the deaf should be taught through the use of signed languages, such as [[American Sign Language]] (ASL).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cued Speech and Literacy: History, Research, and Background Information|url=http://www.cuedspeech.org/pdfs/facts/Cued-Speech-and-Literary.pdf|author=National Cued Speech Association|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within the United States, proponents of Cued Speech often discuss the system as an alternative to ASL and similar sign languages, although others note that it can be learned in addition to such languages.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.zak.co.il/deaf-info/old/cued_speech.html Cued Speech FAQ&lt;/ref&gt; For the ASL using community, Cued Speech is a unique potential component for learning [[English as a second language]].  Within Bilingual-Bicultural models, Cued Speech does not borrow or invent signs from ASL, nor does CS attempt to change ASL syntax or grammar.  Rather, CS provides an unambiguous model for language learning that leaves ASL intact.{{Citation needed|date=July 2016}}

==Languages==
Cued speech has been adapted to more than fifty languages and dialects.  However, it is not clear how many of them are actually in use.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20120211124413/http://www.cuedspeech.org/sub/cued/language.asp Cued Languages] - list of languages and dialects to which Cued Speech has been adapted&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Culture and Value''''' is a selection from the personal notes of [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] made by [[Georg Henrik von Wright]]. It was first published in English by Basil Blackwell, in German as ''Vermischte Bemerkungen'' in 1977 and the text has been emended in following editions. An English translation by [[Peter Winch]] was printed in 1980, and reprinted in 1984. Ten years later Alois Pichler revised the original edition, and the resulting version was published in 1998 with a new translation by Peter Winch.&lt;ref&gt;L. Wittgenstein (1998), ''Culture and Value'', ed. by Georg Henrik von Wright, rev. ed. London: Wiley-Blackwell, {{ISBN|0631205713}}, {{ISBN|978-0631205715}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The remarks are arranged in chronological order with an indication of their year of origin.  Nearly half of them stem from the period after the completion (in 1945) of Part One of [[Philosophical Investigations]].

At the end of the book appears a poem which was offered by Wittgenstein to the Hofrat Ludwig Hänsel, and it is assumed that he was its author.

Among the published notes particular attention has been bestowed on a passage where Wittgenstein enumerated people who, in his judgement, had influenced him: [[Ludwig Boltzmann|Boltzmann]], [[Heinrich Hertz|Hertz]], [[Arthur Schopenhauer|Schopenhauer]], [[Gottlob Frege|Frege]], [[Bertrand Russell|Russell]], [[Karl Kraus (writer)|Kraus]], [[Adolf Loos|Loos]], [[Otto Weininger|Weininger]],  [[Oswald Spengler|Spengler]] and [[Piero Sraffa|Sraffa]].&lt;ref&gt;Wittgenstein (1998), p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; Of note to literary scholars, the book also contains some of Wittgenstein's thoughts on [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]], negatively comparing his depictions of character to those of [[Leo Tolstoy|Tolstoy]].

A further note dating from the same year (1931) witnesses the first occurrence of the term '[[family resemblance]]' in a discussion of Spengler's work.&lt;ref&gt;Wittgenstein (1998), p. 21&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cuyuxquihui''' is an archaeological site located in the [[Tecolutla River|Tecolutla]] valley of [[Veracruz]], [[Mexico]], in the region of the [[Totonac]] culture, about {{convert|22|km}} southeast of [[El Tajín]] or {{convert|5|km}} southeast of [[Paso del Correo, Veracruz|Paso de Correo]].

The name of Cuyuxquihui is a composed word from the [[Totonacan languages|Totonac language]]: ''cuyu'', [[armadillo]] and ''quihui'', [[wood]] and it points to the similarity of the local fauna to the shell of that animal.&lt;ref name=Portal&gt;{{cite web|first=|last=|title=Cuyuxquihui|url=http://portal.veracruz.gob.mx/portal/page?_pageid=313,4309079&amp;_dad=portal&amp;_schema=PORTAL|publisher portal de veracruz=|location=|language=Spanish|trans-title=Ditto|year=|accessdate=Sep 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090621114641/http://portal.veracruz.gob.mx/portal/page?_pageid=313%2C4309079&amp;_dad=portal&amp;_schema=PORTAL|archivedate=2009-06-21|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This site is about {{convert|74.29|km|mi|1}} southwest from [[Las Higueras (archaeological site)]], another Totonac site in the region.

==The Totonacs==
The Totonac Culture, whose name is possibly translated as "three hearts", likely referring to three centers of this culture:

*El Tajín (300-1200), maximum exponent of the totonacs culture splendor 
*Papantla (900-1519).
*Zempoala (900-1519).

This culture had a large ceramic variety and stone sculpture, monumental architecture and cities with an advanced urban concept.
The Totonac Languages are a family of closely related languages spoken by approximately 200,000 Totonac and [[Tepehua people]] in the states of Veracruz, Puebla, and Hidalgo in Mexico. The Totonacan languages are not demonstrably related to any other languages, although they share numerous areal features with other languages of the Mesoamerican Sprachbund, such as the Mayan languages and Nahuatl.

==The site==
[[File:Cyuxquihui 02.PNG|thumb|350px| Cuyuxquihui Building]]
[[File:Cuyuxquihui03.jpg|thumb|350px| Cuyuxquihui Archaeological Site]] 
This settlement would seem to have been a fortress, due to some architectonic characteristics; the existence of retaining walls that run throughout the esplanade north to south has been confirmed; its height makes it relatively inaccessible from the west, as well as by the cliff that borders it to the east. It is believed it was required due to the large social mobility that ensued after the fall of Tajín.&lt;ref name= Portal /&gt;

Material remains on the various regional settlements, leads to believe that a good part of them were El Tajín contemporaries and that some developed after its gradual abandonment.  Evidence seem to indicate that the Cuyuxquihui settlement was founded in 1250 CE.&lt;ref name= Portal /&gt;

Cuyuxquihui developed, after the El Tajín decline, as an important ceremonial activities center. Diverse structures were constructed by means of ground surface leveling, construction element characteristic of the “Tajín Chico” site. The first constructions used selected materials, which were applied with mortar elements and subsequently were finished with gross stucco and painted.&lt;ref name= Portal /&gt;

Cuyuxquihui was conquered by the Aztecs, Moctezuma Ilhuicamina&lt;ref&gt;Huehue Moctezuma or Moctezuma I El Viejo (The older) (náhuatl: Motēuczōma Ilhuicamina, "Su Señor el Airado, Flechador del Cielo") was the fitfth [[Tlatoani|huey tlatoani]]  or Mexica emperor (1440 - 1469).&lt;/ref&gt; (1398 – 1469) towards 1465, probably one of the most important reasons of the cultural mix of the totonac elements, [[mexicas]] and [[Huastec people|huastecos]].&lt;ref name=Guia  &gt;{{cite journal |last= Cháirez |first=   Arturo |date=  February 2000|title= Guía No. 56 Veracruz |trans-title=Veracruz Guide 56 |journal= Mexico Desconocido |location=  |url=http://www.mexicodesconocido.com.mx/notas/6953-Cuyuxquihui-(Veracruz) |language=Spanish |format= |accessdate=Sep 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structures==
Most important buildings:

=== Building 1 ===
This is a four bodied pyramid and a small vertical wall; remains of blue and red paintings were found on it. Objects found on this building are: a knife, fine ceramics and tablets with Quetzalcoatl engravings, indicate that the building was used for ritual functions.&lt;ref name= Portal /&gt;

=== South Building ===
This structure is considered the oldest in the site.&lt;ref name= Portal /&gt;

=== Building III ===
At the top of this structure, a two meter high monolith was found, it has evidence of having been re-modeled in three occasions; the last one, with Aztec influence occurred in 1400 CE.&lt;ref name= Portal /&gt;

=== Buildings IV and V ===
The structure is also called “dos unidos” (two jointed); in the top both have a small platform, over which probably was another construction, that is not there anymore.&lt;ref name= Portal /&gt;
 
=== Ballgame Court ===
The court is “I” shaped and measures 72 meters long by 4 wide, it was constructed on a topographic accident.&lt;ref name= Portal /&gt;

The '''Dravidian University''', [[Kuppam]], [[Chittoor district]], [[Andhra Pradesh]], [[India]] was established by the [[Government of Andhra Pradesh]], through a Legislature Act (No. 17 of 1997) with the initial support extended by the governments of [[Tamil Nadu]], [[Karnataka]] and [[Kerala]] for an integrated development of [[Dravidian languages]] and culture.
The university, which formally came into existence in 1997, began functioning with two departments in 1998 and has today grown into a strong institution of 20 academic departments and 6 research centres.

{{Conflict of laws}}
In [[law]], '''''dépeçage''''' is a [[conflict of laws]] where different issues within a case may be governed by the laws of different states.  In [[common law]] countries ''dépeçage'' usually means a single [[contract]] which provides that different parts of the contract shall be governed by different laws.&lt;ref&gt;''Broome v Antler's Hunting Club'' 595 F.2d 921, 923; ''Don King Productions, Inc. v. Douglas'', 742 F.Supp.2d 786, 791 (S.D.N.Y. 1990)&lt;/ref&gt;  In the United States, "depecage choice of law theory" is where the court considers disagreement among states over which rule of law is applicable to each issue.&lt;ref&gt;''Lazzara v Howard A Esser Inc'' D.C.Ill 622 F.Supp 382, 384&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept originated in [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] countries, but has also been adopted in common law countries such as the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Ireland]] pursuant to the [[Rome Convention (contract)|Rome Convention on the law applicable to contractual obligations]] (Article 3(1)).

In practice, it is relatively rare for a contract to have more than one expressly chosen governing law.  Two examples of such situations are:
* In [[derivative (finance)|derivatives]] transactions governed by [[International Swaps and Derivatives Association]] (ISDA) standard documentation, it is not uncommon for the [[ISDA Master Agreement]] to be governed by the laws of [[New York (state)|New York]] state, and for the Credit Support Annexe to be governed by [[English law]].  This is because the provisions of English law relating to title transfer under the Credit Support Annexe are thought to be more favourable to the secured party than New York law under the equivalent Credit Support Annexe published by ISDA.  In reality however, although the Annex is described as forming part of the same agreement as the Master Agreement, physically as well as conceptually, they are really two separate documents.
* In ship financing transactions, it is quite common for a statutory ship mortgage to be taken over the vessel which will be governed by the laws of the state in which the ship is registered (which will often be an [[Offshore Financial Centre]] or jurisdiction which provides for [[flag of convenience|flags of convenience]]), however, such mortgages are usually supplemented by a separate deed of covenants, and these will normally be governed by the law which governs the primary financial documentation.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4131">The '''Education Data Exchange Network''' (EDEN) is an [[automated]] [[system]] designed to support [[data transfer]] among state and local [[education]] agencies and the [[United States Department of Education]] (ED).
EDEN began as a State Data Network [[pilot experiment|pilot test]] among [[Oregon]], [[Nebraska]] and ED in 1998. At the time all reports on [[Federal government of the United States|federal]] grant programs were written and stored in paper file cabinets in ED program offices, although many of those reports contained similar, and often inconsistent, information. States, particularly the [[Council of Chief State School Officers]] and their data managers, called on ED to automate and streamline the process. Based on the success of the pilot test, the [Office of Management and Budget] (OMB) required ED to institute a Performance-Based Data Management Initiative (PBDMI) in 2000. PBDMI was designed to gather [[statistics]] from each state such as [[school]] populations within subgroups (race, gender, etc.), graduation rates, school spending, and federal program performance. This initiative resulted in EDEN. It was designed to:
* Improve the accuracy, timeliness, and utility of information collected to inform educational management, budget and policy decisions.
* Increase the focus on outcomes and accountability.
* Reduce the education reporting burden by streamlining the [[data collection]] process and eliminating [[data redundancy|redundancy]] across ED programs.
* Create a [[partnership]] between ED and state and local education agencies to improve [[data quality]] and management through common data standards and collaborative systems planning.

By 2004, all states participated in EDEN. In 2005 ED began to require that all elementary and secondary level federal reports, including those to the [[National Center for Education Statistics]] (NCES) be submitted through EDEN.
The ED Office of the [[Inspector General]] and the [[General Accounting Office]] published reports critical of the program's management.[1] In March 2005, the [[United States Secretary of Education|Secretary of Education]], Margaret Spellings abolished the office administering EDEN and removed all managers from managerial positions.[2]
PBDMI and EDEN data gathering is complicated by the fact that no data sent to federal agencies may contain [[private data]] about an individual student that would violate the [[FERPA]] guidelines. So a state agency cannot just send a list of students and their test scores. A reporting agency can only send summary subgroup data for subgroup populations above a small number such as five.
EDEN data sets consists of three types:
* Statewide data often called State Education Agencies (SEA)
* District or regional data Local Education Agencies (LEA)
* School-specific data
There are [[XML]] representations of EDEN files as well as [[XML schema]]s to validate these files available from the ed.gov file specifications site (www2.ed.gov/about/inits/ed/edfacts/eden/non-xml/c163-8-0.doc).EDEN program data is now (2014) aggregated in the EDFACTS system for all program offices, senior management, and federal reporting. EDEN data collection is now operated out of the NCES.

EDEN received many commendations including from CCSSO, the [[Council for Excellence in Government]], and from the Office of Management and Budget in the President's 2005 Budget submission, EDEN was selected as a model project for in depth review in a 2005 presidential transition Guide for Federal Leaders and Managers. A [[General Accounting Office]] report commended the initiative and recommended increased support for it from ED administration, including making the program mandatory and including NCES reports.

'''Elizabeth Campbell''' (1893–1971) was an American archeologist, notable for proposing a much earlier date for the presence of man in the desert Southwest than was generally accepted. She worked with her husband William (Bill) Campbell and first proposed that artifacts found along the shores of [[Lake Mojave]] and other [[Pleistocene]] lakes and rivers of the desert West were contemporaneous with the presence of water.  They showed that there were virtually no sites that were not associated with archaic water sources.  They hypothesized that the geologic features associated with the artifacts could be used to date the period of human habitation.  This is the first use of what has become known as [[environmental archaeology]].&lt;ref name='warren2017'&gt;{{cite book|last1=Warren|first1=Claude N.|author-link1=Claude Nelson Warren|last2=Schneider|first2=Joan S.|title=Purple Hummingbird: A Biography of Elizabeth Warder Crozer Campbell|date=2017|publisher=University of Utah Press|isbn=9781607815181}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Life ==

Elizabeth Crozer was the youngest of four daughters born to upper class parents: John Price Crozer II and Elizabeth Steger Warder Crozer of [[Upland, Pennsylvania]].  She was born on August 11, 1893 at the Crozer summer cottage in [[Beach Haven, New Jersey]].&lt;ref name="warren2017"/&gt;

Her father was the grandson of [[John Price Crozer]], founder of the Crozer textile mills and possessor of the Crozer fortune.&lt;ref name="mcQueen1982"&gt;McQueen, David A. (1982) ''The Crozers of Upland 1723-1926'', Serendipity Wress, Wilmington, Deleware&lt;/ref&gt;  When the elder John Crozer died the younger John Crozer inherited the mills and formed a partnership with his father under the name: S. A. Crozer and Son.  When S. A Crozer died in 1910 John inherited coal companies, an iron and steel company, shared of a railroad and farms.&lt;ref name="warren2017"/&gt; The Crozer family founded the [[Crozer Theological Seminary]], the [[Crozer Arboretum]], and the [[Crozer Quarterly]].  They also built the [[George K. Crozer Mansion]] and are the namesake of the [[Crozer-Keystone Health System]].

Her uncle was [[Hermann Volrath Hilprecht]], professor of Assyriology at the [[University of Pennsylvania]] and a scholar of Near Eastern archaeology.  He was involved in the excavations at the Near Eastern site of [[Nippur]].  Campbell described in her diary how her Aunt Sallie would travel with Hilprecht to Europe and how "..[s]he never let her loveliness interfere with anything.  She climbed the pyramids with three Arabs to push and pull."&lt;ref name="crozer1908"&gt;Crozer, Elizabeth W. (1908) Diary of Elizabeth Crozer.  Manuscript on file in the Joshua Tree National Park archives, Twentynine Palms, California&lt;/ref&gt;

Campbell was schooled at home by a French tutor until age fourteen.&lt;ref name="JTNP"&gt;Elizabeth Campbell - Joshua Tree National Park (U.S. National Park Service),  https://www.nps.gov/jotr/learn/historyculture/campbell.htm, Retrieved April 15, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;  In the fall of 1909 she began attending Miss Irwin's School (later the Agnes Irwin School) and graduated in 1911.  Until World War II the education of most daughters of Philadelphia high society who attended Miss Irwin's ended at the secondary level.&lt;ref&gt;Baltzell, Edward Digby, (1989) ''Philadelphia Gentlemen: The Making of a National Upper Class'', Transaction Publishers, New Jersey.&lt;/ref&gt;  This was Campbell's last formal education.

Campbell married William (Bill) Campbell in May 1920.&lt;ref&gt;Antevs, Ernst, (1945) "William Henry Campbell, 1895-1944",  ''American Antiquity'', 10(4) pp 379-382.&lt;/ref&gt;  Bill had served in World War I and had been gassed two days before the armistice of November 11, 1918.&lt;ref name='warren2017'/&gt;  Bill's lung damage due to exposure to mustard gas caused them to move to [[Los Angeles, California]] and later to the drier climes of [[Twentynine Palms, California|Twentynine Palms]] where they established a homestead.

When Campbell's father died in 1926 she inherited a trust&lt;ref name="JTNP"/&gt; that enabled her and Bill to live comfortably for the rest of their lives.  The Campbells were considered pillars of the Twentynine Palms community and developed a reputation as benefactors of both individual and community endeavours.&lt;ref&gt;Epstein, Joseph, "The Late, Great American WASP", ''Wall Street Journal'', December 21–22, 2013: C1-C2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bagley1978"&gt;Bagley, Hellen, 1978) ''Sand in My Shoe:  Homestead Days in Twentynine Palms'', Homestead Publishers, Twentynine Palms, California.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Campbells maintained their residence in Twentynine Palms, and lived in a summer home on the shores of [[Lake Tahoe]], near [[Glenbrook, Nevada]].  It was here that Bill died in June 1944.  After Bill's death Campbell sold the house in Twentynine Palms and moved to [[Carson City, Nevada]] where she met and married Joe Cecil Turman.  The marriage lasted a short time before it was annulled.&lt;ref name="warren2017"/&gt;  She moved to [[Tucson, Arizona]] around 1952 where she lived until 1961.

While living in Tucson she became a research associate with the [[Arizona State Museum]]&lt;ref name="warren2017"/&gt; and continued to work on the collections she and Bill had assembled over the years.  In 1957 she had Arizona State Museum exhibit designer Robert Baker design a laboratory on the second floor of her Tucson home.&lt;ref name="baker1957"&gt;Baker, Robert G, (1957) Drawing of a plan for archaeological laboratory for Tucson home of Elizabeth W.C. Campbell.  Elizabeth Crozer Campbell file, Administrative Records, Arizona State Museum Archives, University of Arizona, Tucson (File 129A)&lt;/ref&gt;  During this time she also wrote a memoir about homesteading in Twentynine Palms, ''The Desert was Home.''&lt;ref name="campbell1961"&gt;Campbell, Elizabeth W. Crozer, (1961) ''The Desert Was Home'', Westernlore Press, Los Angeles, California.&lt;/ref&gt;  Campbell made a trip to Twentynine Palms for an event marking the publication of her book and made the decision to move back there.  She remained in Twentynine Palms for the rest of her life.&lt;ref name="bagley1978"/&gt;  Elizabeth Campbell died on December 21, 1971.  She was cremated and her cremains were interred alongside those of her husband Bill in a single plot in Twentynine Palms Cemetery.&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth Warder "Betty" Crozer Campbell - Find a Grave Memorial, https://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&amp;GRid=92706255, accessed April 20, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;  Her obituary was published in ''The Masterkey.''&lt;ref&gt;(1972) Obit for Elizabeth Crozer Campbell, ''The Masterkey'' Vol. 46, No. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career in Archaeology ==

Campbell developed an interest in archaeology after she and Bill moved to Twentynine Palms. She began collecting arrowheads from nearby sand dunes while gathering firewood.  When Bill McHaney, an old prospector who often visited their camp, told stories about Indian culture and caches of pottery, she listened and took notes.&lt;ref name="JTNP"/&gt;  They would drive their trusty automobile -- "The Ship of the Desert"&lt;ref name='campbell1961'/&gt;—into the surrounding countryside looking for archaeological sites and visiting locations that McHaney told them about.  It was said that archaeology met Campbell's need for "intellectual effort and accomplishment" and ameliorated the lonely desert life.&lt;ref name='bagley1978'/&gt;  The Campbells were among the earliest archaeologists in the California desert.  At the time (1925) virtually nothing was known about how long humans had lived in the deserts and the use of [[stratigraphy (archaeology)|stratigraphy]] as a means of chronological ordering of archaeological assemblages was just beginning.&lt;ref name='warren2017'/&gt;

Campbell's first monograph was published by the [[Southwest Museum of the American Indian|Southwest Museum]] in 1931.&lt;ref name="crozer1931a"&gt;Campbell, Elizabeth Crozer, (1931) ''An Archaeological Reconnaissance of the Twenty Nine Palms Region'', Southwest Museum Papers No. 7,  Southwest Museum, Pasadena, California.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1932 the Campbells were appointed fellows in archaeology of the Southwest Museum and hosted a conference in Twentynine Palms on April 22–23 of that year.&lt;ref name="hinchman1932"&gt;Hinchman, Fred K, (1932) "Southwestern Archaeological Federation at Twenty-Nine Palms.", ''The Masterkey'', 6(2):52-56&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1933 the Campbells began their investigation of [[Pinto Basin]].  The area is associated with an extinct river channel and a dry lake bed.&lt;ref name="campbellAmsden1934"&gt;Campbell, Elizabeth Crozer and Charles Amsden, (1934) "The Eagle Mountain Site.", ''The Masterkey'', 8(6):170-173&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CampbellCampbell1935"&gt;Campbell, Elizabeth W. Crozer and William Campbell, (1935) ''The Pinto Basin Site: An Ancient Aboriginal Camping Ground in the California Desert'', Southwest Museum Papers No. 9, Southwest Museum, Los Angeles, California.&lt;/ref&gt;  Campbell began consulting with geologists and paleontologists at the [[California Institute of Technology]].  Geologist David Scharf authored the geological chapter of the Pinto Basin report in one of the first collaborations of geologists and archaeologists.  The artifacts from Pinto Basin were associated with the dry stream channel known as [[Pinto Wash]] and the lake bed known as [[Palen Dry Lake]].  This suggested that these sites were occupied during the period of time when the desert was considerably wetter.&lt;ref name="warren2017"/&gt;  The Campbells argued that this wet period was not recent and presented as evidence the ground-water level being 97 feet below the surface of the surrounding arid mountain ranges.  Starting with the Pinto Basin report, and for all research after, Campbell collaborated and consulted with well-known professionals in the fields of geology, paleontology, and archaeology.  This increased her professional status and standing with the archaeological community.&lt;ref name="warren2017"/&gt;

In early 1934 the Campbells collected artifacts from the high shorelines of [[Silver Lake (Mojave)|Silver Lake]] playa (the northern basin of Lake Mojave) and in 1935 they collected from the shorelines of [[Soda Lake (San Bernardino County)|Soda Lake]] playa (the southern basin of Lake Mojave).  Campbell stated she and Bill wanted to become experts in [[Dry Lake|playa]] culture.&lt;ref name="campbell1935"&gt;Typewritten report from Elizabeth Campbell to the National Park Service on 1935 reconnaissance carried out in San Bernardino County.  On file in the Joshua Tree National Park archives., Twentynine Palms, California&lt;/ref&gt;  Campbell believed that most ancient sites would be located in the [[Great Basin]].&lt;ref name="campbell1937"&gt;Typewritten report from Elizabeth Campbell to the National Park Service on 1937 reconnaissance carried out in San Bernardino County.  On file in the Joshua Tree National Park archives., Twentynine Palms, California&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1936 Campbell published her seminal paper "Archaeological Problems in the Southern California Deserts"&lt;ref name="campbell1936a"&gt;Campbell, Elizabeth W. Crozer, (1936) Archaeological Problems in the Southern California Deserts, ''American Antiquity'', 1(4) pp 235-300&lt;/ref&gt; in which she outlined her hypothesis that associated prehistoric peoples with certain landforms.  She believed a thorough study of the spatial relationships of artifact assemblages to the landscape would illuminate their chronology.&lt;ref name="warren2017"/&gt;  This approach is clearly laid out in the Lake Mohave report&lt;ref name="campbellCampbell1937"&gt;Campbell, Elizabeth W.C., William H. Campbell, Ernst Anteves, Charles E. Amsden, J.A. Barbieri and F.D. Bode, (1937) "The Lake Mohave Site" in ''The Archaeology of Pleistocene Lake Mohave: A Symposium'', Southwest Museum Papers No. 11:9, Southwest Museum, Los Angeles, California&lt;/ref&gt; where she wrote: {{quote|text=In order to prove that a site has great age, it should be a pure site; that is, the artifacts should represent one period only, and it should be situated where the geology of the regions points to antiquity. For this reason we have sought man's ancient remains along extinct river channels and about the strand lines of playas and fossil lakes, indicated as such by beaches, terraces, spits, and wave-cut cliffs -- mute testimony to a past day of moister climate.  We have not be disappointed in our search for locations by geological indication, for during the last two years the Desert Laboratory of the Southwest Museum has found and studied ten sites of the desired type.  As all of these are now far from water, their occupants no doubt belonged to a period of greater rainfall.}}

Noted archaeologists of the day disagreed with Campbell's interpretation&lt;ref name="rogers1939"&gt;Rogers, Malcom J, (1939) Early Lithic Industries of the Lower Basin of the Colorado River and Adjacent Desert Areas. ''San Diego Museum Papers 3'', San Diego Museum of Man, San Diego, California&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="roberts1940"&gt;Roberts, Frank H.H Jr., (1940) Developments in the Problem of the North American Paleo-Indian.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3029">The '''Equestrian Monument of Cosimo I''' is a bronze equestrian statue erected in 1594 in the [[Piazza della Signoria]] in [[Florence]], region of [[Tuscany]], Italy.
[[File:Statue Cosimo I Giambologna Piazza della Signoria n02.jpg|thumb|Monument of Cosimo I]]
==History==
This statue follows the [[Ancient Rome|Classical Roman]] tradition of [[Equestrian statues]] as the monument to a ruler's power, evident from the [[Equestrian Statue of Marcus Aurelius|Statue of Marcus Aurelius]] in ancient Rome and the [[Regisole]] in Ferrara, and continued in the Renaissance by examples such as [[Donatello]]'s [[Equestrian statue of Gattamelata|Statue of Gattamelata]] (1453) in Padua and [[Verrocchio]]'s [[Equestrian statue of Bartolomeo Colleoni|Statue of Bartolomeo Colleoni]] (1488) in Venice.

This monument was commissioned by Cosimo's son [[Ferdinando I de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany|Ferdinando I]] from the sculptor [[Giambologna]], who also completed the [[Rape of the Sabine Women (Giambologna)|Rape of the Sabines]] in the adjacent [[Loggia dei Lanzi]]. The Cosimo statue stands in front of the north corner of the [[Palazzo della Signoria]], the northernmost of the row of statues, adjacent to the [[Fountain of Neptune, Florence|Fountain of Neptune]] (1563) by [[Bartolomeo Ammannati|Ammannati]], that had been commissioned by Cosimo himself. Together this duo celebrates the land and sea ambitions of Cosimo. The base of the statue has reliefs with scenes from the life of Cosimo, including his coronation in Rome as Grand-Duke in 1570 and his entrance into Siena as a ruler (1557) after his victory over that republic.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=bKseLWQBnsQC Viaggio per diverse parti d'Italia], (1832) Volume 3, page 183.&lt;/ref&gt;

The posture of the trotting horse in this statue is similar to those of prior statues, with right leg raised, however unlike Marcus Aurelius, Cosimo uses stirrups and his horse shows the restraint of the bridle, albeit without much tension. Cosimo, like Gattemalata, holds a military baton, armor, and sheathed sword.

Some sources state the man and horse were cast separately, and the combined weight of the two was 23 thousand pounds.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=FfATAAAAQAAJ Storia della scultura dal suo risorgimento in Italia], Volume 6, by Leopoldo Cicognara, page 402.&lt;/ref&gt; A few decades hence, Ferdinando I would have his own [[Equestrian statue of Ferdinando I|Equestrian monument in Piazza dell'Annunziata]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=9Ws5AAAAcAAJ Corografia dell'Italia], Volume 3, by Giovanni B. Rampoldi, 1837, page 1085.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:BadElster Schandfleck4549.JPG|thumb|right|[[Bad Elster]], [[Saxony]], [[Germany]] in April 2008. Wettiner Hof Hotel is awaiting renovation- locally it is known as the Schandfleck (the Eyesore).]]
An '''eyesore''' is something that is largely considered to look unpleasant or ugly. Its technical usage is as an alternative perspective to the notion of [[landmark]]. Common examples include [[dilapidation|dilapidated]] [[buildings]], [[graffiti]], [[litter]], [[pollution|polluted areas]], and excessive commercial [[signage]] such as [[billboards]]. Some eyesores may be a matter of opinion such as controversial [[modern architecture]] (see also [[spite house]]), [[transmission tower]]s or [[wind turbines]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2006/jun/25/uk.renewableenergy|title=Homeowners get green light for 'eyesore' wind turbines|author=Nick Mathiason|date=June 25, 2006|publisher=The Guardian | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/6763067.stm|title=Eyesore or gem: Gateshead car park |publisher=BBC|date= 18 June 2007 | first=Building | last=Site}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Natural eyesores include [[feces]], [[mud]] and [[weed]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BL4Xrx-IFowC|page=255|title=Professional Planting Design|author=Scott C. Scarfone | isbn=978-0-471-76139-6 | year=2007 | publisher=John Wiley and Sons}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effect on property values==
In the USA, the [[National Association of Realtors]] says an eyesore can shave about 10% off the value of a nearby listing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dealing with an eyesore next door |url=http://realestate.msn.com/Selling/Article_mw.aspx?cp-documentid=5249535 |author=Rachel Koning Beals |accessdate=2008-03-16 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080312214811/http://realestate.msn.com/Selling/Article_mw.aspx?cp-documentid=5249535 |archivedate=2008-03-12 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Remediation==

Clean-up programmes to improve or remove eyesores are often started by local bodies or even national governments. These are frequently called ''Operation Eyesore''.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|publisher=Los Angeles Times|date=February 9, 1972|title=British Start 'Operation Eyesore' Cleanup}}&lt;/ref&gt;  High-profile international events such as the [[Olympic Games]] usually trigger such activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|publisher=New York Times|title=Russians Paint and Fuss As Olympic Games Near Putting Best Face on Things A Gleaming Soviet Capital Emigrate or Face Arrest|date=June 28, 1980|author=Craig R. Whitney}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Others contend that it is best to nip such problems in the bud by addressing them while they are small, since signs of neglect encourage [[anti-social behaviour]] such as [[vandalism]] and [[fly-tipping]]. This strategy is known as ''[[Fixing Broken Windows|fixing broken windows]]''.

==Controversy==

Whether some constructions are eyesores is a matter of opinion which may change over time. [[Landmark]]s are often called eyesores.

===Examples of divided opinion===
[[File:Federation Square (SBS Building).jpg|thumb|right|[[Federation Square]] has divided opinion in [[Melbourne]].&lt;ref name=Fed/&gt;]]
* [[Eiffel Tower]] – Upon its construction, Parisians wanted it torn down as an eyesore. Nowadays it is one of the world's top landmarks.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|

* [[Golden Gate Bridge]] was controversial ahead of its construction, it being said in ''[[The Wasp (magazine)|The Wasp]]'' that it "would prove an eye-sore to those now living  ... certainly mar if not utterly destroy the natural charm of the harbor famed throughout the world."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=v3WWvdOUcFEC&amp;pg=PA278|page=278|title=Great American Bridges and Dams|author=Donald C.

* [[One Rincon Hill]] – Situated just south of [[San Francisco]]'s [[Financial District, San Francisco|Financial District]], this high-rise condominium surrounded by shorter buildings has generated some mixed reviews.
* [[Lloyd's building]] – Situated in the [[City of London]], this building was described as an [[oil refinery]] when it was opened in 1986&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.inlondonguide.co.uk/london-buildings/city/81-lloyds-building-insurance.html|title=The Lloyd's Building|accessdate=January 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; for having most of its facilities, stairways and [[Air Conditioning|AC]] on the outside. Some people still say this, although the building has become more popular and liked in the recent years.
* [[Tour Montparnasse]] - lone skyscraper in the [[Montparnasse]] area of [[Paris]], [[France]]. Its appearance mars the Paris urban landscape, and construction of skyscrapers have been banned in the city two years after its completion. A 2008 poll of editors on [[Virtualtourist]] voted the building the second ugliest building in the world. It is sometimes said that the view from the top is the most beautiful in Paris, because it is the only place from which the tower itself cannot be seen.
* [[Brisbane Transit Centre]] and [[Riverside Expressway]] – have been called eyesores and planning debacles by [[University of Queensland]] Associate Professor of Architecture Peter Skinner.&lt;ref name=BTC&gt;{{cite news |first=Georgina |last=Robinson |title=Brisbane's biggest eyesores and planning debacles |url=http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/articles/2008/01/24/1201025055483.html |work=Brisbane Times |publisher=Fairfax Digital |date=2008-01-24 |accessdate=May 29, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[art]] and [[art criticism]], '''form and content''' are considered distinct aspects of a [[work of art]]. The term ''form'' refers to the work's style, techniques and media used, and how the [[Design elements and principles|elements of design]] are implemented. ''Content'', on the other hand, refers to a work's subject matter, or what is being depicted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://arthistory.about.com/cs/reference/f/what_is_art.htm|title=How to Define Art|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gender essentialism''' is the theory that there are certain universal, innate, biologically- or psychologically-based features of [[gender]] (different from [[sex]]) that are at the root of observed differences in the behavior of men and women.&lt;ref name="Hepburn-2008"&gt;{{cite book | last = Hepburn | first = Alexa | chapter = Feminist critics: hetrosexism and lesbian and gay psychology |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=rfIFQIa9rFMC&amp;pg=PA107 | title = An introduction to critical social psychology | page = 107 | publisher = Sage | location = London Thousand Oaks, California | year = 2003 | isbn = 9780761962106 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In Western civilization, it is suggested in writings going back to [[ancient Greece]].&lt;ref name="Bem-1993"&gt;{{cite book | last = Bem | first = Sandra |authorlink=Sandra Bem | chapter = Introduction | chapterurl = https://books.google.com/books?id=u2a59A74CPcC&amp;pg=PA1 | title = The lenses of gender: transforming the debate on sexual inequality | pages = 1&amp;ndash;2 | publisher = Yale University Press | location = New Haven, Connecticut | year = 1993 | isbn = 9780300061635 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|1}} With the advent of [[Christianity]], the earlier Greek model was expressed in theological discussions as the doctrine that there are two distinct sexes, male and female created by God, and that our nature is to be immutably one or the other.&lt;ref name="Thatcher-2011"&gt;{{cite book | last = Thatcher | first = Adrian | chapter = Gender: language, power, and history |chapterurl = https://books.google.com/books?id=hcNyAOxMLFsC&amp;pg=PA19 | title = God, sex, and gender: an introduction |page=19 | publisher = Wiley-Blackwell | location = Chichester, West Sussex, United Kingdom | year = 2011 | isbn = 9781444396379 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This view remained essentially unchanged until the middle of the 19th century, until [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]]'s publications on evolution. This changed the locus of the origin of the essential differences, in [[Sandra Bem]]'s words, "from God's grand creation [to] its scientific equivalent: evolution's grand creation," but the belief in an immutable origin had not changed.&lt;ref name="Bem-1993" /&gt;{{rp|2}}

It was not until the middle of the 20th century and the writings of [[second-wave feminism]] starting with [[Simone de Beauvoir]] that the first alternative theory for gender difference was proposed.  This theory was developed by feminist theorists in the 1960s, 70s, and beyond, and described gender difference as being [[social construction of gender|socially constructed]], namely that the origin of gender difference is not in-born, but learned from interacting in society.  Feminists are by no means unanimous in supporting theories of the social construction of gender.  Many adhere more to gender essentialism, or to some intermediate viewpoint.  The two theories — gender essentialism and social constructionism — inform an active debate about the origins of gender differences in the fields of feminism, philosophy, and sociology which are sometimes acrimonious and break out into local and national politics.{{cn|date=December 2017}}

== Manifestations ==

=== In feminism ===

In [[feminist theory]] and [[gender studies]], '''gender essentialism''' is the attribution of a fixed essence to women.&lt;ref name=":03"&gt;{{cite book | last = Grosz | first = Elizabeth A. | author-link = Elizabeth Grosz | title = Space, time, and perversion: essays on the politics of bodies | publisher = Routledge | location = New York | year = 1995 | url = https://books.google.com/books/about/Space_Time_and_Perversion.html?id=Htf7y-rcVFwC | isbn = 9780415911368 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Women's essence is assumed to be universal and is generally identified with those characteristics viewed as being specifically feminine.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt; These ideas of femininity are usually related to biology and often concern psychological characteristics such as nurturance, empathy, support, non-competitiveness, etc.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt; Feminist theorist [[Elizabeth Grosz]] states in her 1995 publication, ''Space, Time and Perversion: Essays on the Politics of Bodies'', that essentialism "entails the belief that those characteristics defined as women's essence are shared in common by all women at all times. It implies a limit of the variations and possibilities of change—it is not possible for a subject to act in a manner contrary to her essence. Her essence underlies all the apparent variations differentiating women from each other. Essentialism thus refers to the existence of fixed characteristic, given attributes, and ahistorical functions that limit the possibilities of change and thus of social reorganization."&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt;

Furthermore, biologism is a particular form of essentialism that defines women's essence in terms of biological capacities.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt; This form of essentialism is based on a form of reductionism, meaning that social and cultural factors are the effects of biological causes.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt; Biological reductivism "claim[s] that anatomical and physiological differences—especially reproductive differences—characteristic of human males and females determine both the meaning of masculinity and femininity and the appropriately different positions of men and women in society".&lt;ref name=":43"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Diquinzio | first = Patrice | title = Exclusion and essentialism in feminist theory: the problem of mothering | journal = [[Hypatia (journal)|Hypatia: A Journal of Feminist Philosophy]] | volume = 8 | issue = 3 | pages = 1&amp;ndash;20 | publisher = [[Wiley-Blackwell|Wiley]] | doi = 10.1111/j.1527-2001.1993.tb00033.x | jstor = 3810402 | date = Summer 1993 | url = https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1527-2001.1993.tb00033.x | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; Biologism uses the functions of reproduction, nurturance, neurology, neurophysiology, and endocrinology to limit women's social and psychological possibilities according to biologically established limits.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt; It asserts the science of biology to constitute an unalterable definition of identity, which inevitably "amounts to a permanent form of social containment for women".&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt; Naturalism is also a part of the system of essentialism where a fixed nature is postulated for women through the means of theological or ontological rather than biological grounds. An example of this would be the claim that women's nature is a God-given attribute, or the ontological invariants in [[Existentialism|Sartrean existentialism]] or [[Sigmund Freud|Freudian psychoanalysis]] that distinguish the sexes in the "claim that the human subject is somehow free or that the subjects social position is a function of his or her genital morphology".&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt; These systems are used to homogenize women into one singular category and to strengthen a binary between men and women.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt;

=== In religion ===

==== LDS ====

The official view of [[Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (Mormons; LDS) is an essentialist belief in gender.  The 1995 LDS statement, [[The Family: A Proclamation to the World]] states the official view, and declares gender to be an "essential characteristic" of sons and daughters of God, and an "eternal identity."  Mormon people generally believe in an eternal life, and that it would be impossible for one's eternal gender to be different from one's physical, birth sex.  Church regulations permit, but don't mandate, [[ex-communication]] for those who choose [[sexual reassignment surgery]], and deny them membership in the [[priesthood (Latter Day Saints)|priesthood]].&lt;ref name="Copeland-2015"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Copeland |first1=Mychal  |last2=Rose |first2=D’vorah |last3=Gustav-Wrathall |first3=John |chapter=The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (Mormon) |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=D7XQCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA31 | title = Struggling in good faith: LGBTQI inclusion from 13 American religious perspectives |page=31| publisher = Walking Together, Finding the Way/SkyLight Paths Publishing | location = Woodstock, Vermont | year = 2016 | isbn = 9781594736025 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism and alternative theories of gender ==
{{Cleanup rewrite|the section is full of jargon; there are other articles better suited for this information, this should just summarize the topic. |section |date=December 2017}}

=== Social construction of gender ===

{{Main|Social construction of gender}}
The main alternative to gender essentialism is the theory of the [[social construction of gender]].  In contrast to gender essentialism which views differences between men and women as innate, universal, and immutable, social constructionism views gender as created and influenced by society and culture, which can be different according to time and place, and that roles societally defined as appropriate behavior for a person of that specific sex then become the standard to which members of that sex are measured against. Theories of the social construction of gender grew out of theories in [[second-wave feminism]] in the latter half of the twentieth century.{{cn|date=December 2017}} 

==== Gender performativity ====

{{Main|Gender performativity}}
[[Judith Butler]]'s theory of [[gender performativity]] can be seen as a means to show "the ways in which reified and naturalized conceptions of gender might be understood as constituted and, hence, capable of being constituted differently".&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Butler | first = Judith | author-link = Judith Butler | title = Performative acts and gender constitution: an essay in phenomenology and feminist theory | journal = [[Theatre Journal]] | volume = 40 | issue = 4 | pages = 519&amp;ndash;531 | publisher = [[Johns Hopkins University Press]] | doi = 10.2307/3207893 | jstor = 3207893 | date = December 1988 | url = https://doi.org/10.2307/3207893 | ref = harv | postscript = .}} [http://seas3.elte.hu/coursematerial/TimarAndrea/17a.Butler,performative%5B1%5D.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt; Butler utilizes the phenomenological theory of acts which has been espoused by [[Edmund Husserl]], [[Maurice Merleau-Ponty]] and [[George Herbert Mead]], which seeks to explain the mundane way in which "social agents constitute social reality through language gesture and all manner of symbolic social sign", to create her conception of gender performativity.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; She begins by quoting [[Simone de Beauvoir|Simone de Beauvoir's]] claim: &lt;blockquote href="Parmenides (dialogue)"&gt;''"...one is not born, but, rather, becomes a woman."''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = de Beauvoir | first = Simone | author-link = Simone de Beauvoir | title = The second sex | publisher = Vintage Classic | location = London | year = 2015 | origyear = 1949 | isbn = 9781784870386 }}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;This statement distinguishes sex from gender suggesting that gender is an aspect of identity that is gradually acquired.&lt;ref name=":23"&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Butler | first = Judith | author-link = Judith Butler | title = Sex and gender in Simone de Beauvoir's ''Second Sex'' | journal = [[Yale French Studies]], special issue: Simone de Beauvoir: Witness to a Century | volume = 72 | pages = 35&amp;ndash;49 | publisher = [[Yale University Press]] | doi = 10.2307/2930225 | jstor = 2930225 | date = 1986 | url = https://doi.org/10.2307/2930225 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; This distinction between sex, as the anatomical and factic aspects of the female body, and gender, as the cultural meaning that forms the body and the various modes of bodily articulation, means that it is "no longer possible to attribute the values or social functions of women to biological necessity".&lt;ref name=":23" /&gt; Butler interprets this claim as an appropriation of the doctrine of constituting acts from the tradition of phenomenology.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; Through this understanding Butler concludes that "gender is in no way a stable identity or locus of agency from which various acts proceed; rather, it is an identity tenuously constituted in time—an identity instituted through the stylization of the body and, hence, must be understood as the mundane way in which bodily gestures, movements and enactments of various kinds constitute the illusion of an abiding gendered self".&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; 

Candace West and Sarah Fenstermaker also conceptualize gender "as a routine, methodical, and ongoing accomplishment, which involves a complex of perceptual, interactional and micropolitical activities that cast particular pursuits as expressions of manly and womanly 'natures'" in their 1995 text ''Doing Difference''.&lt;ref name=":53"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = West | first1 = Candace | last2 = Fenstermaker | first2 = Sarah | title = Doing difference | journal = [[Gender &amp; Society]] | volume = 9 | issue = 1 | pages = 8&amp;ndash;37 | publisher = [[Sage Publications|Sage]] | doi = 10.1177/089124395009001002 | jstor = 189596 | date =  February 1995 | url = https://doi.org/10.1177/089124395009001002 | ref = harv | postscript = .}} [http://www.csun.edu/~snk1966/Doing%20Difference.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt;

This does not mean that the material nature of the human body is denied, instead, it is re-comprehended as separate from the process by which "the body comes to bear cultural meanings".&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; Therefore, the essence of gender is not natural because gender itself is not a natural fact.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":23" /&gt; Gender is the outcome of the sedimentation of specific corporeal acts that have been inscribed through repetition and rearticulation over time onto the body.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; "If the reality of gender is constituted by the performance itself, then there is no recourse to an essential and unrealized 'sex' or 'gender' which gender performances ostensibly express".&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;

==== Exclusion in feminist theory ====

===== Intersectionality =====

{{Main|Intersectionality}}
{{One source|section|date=October 2017}}
Analyzing gender has been a concern of feminist theory, thus there have been many modes of understanding how gender addresses meaning.&lt;ref name=":43" /&gt; However, developing such theories of gender can obscure the significance of other aspects of women's identities, such as race, class, and sexual orientation, which marginalizes the experiences and voices of women of colour, non-Western women, working-class women, queer women, and trans women.&lt;ref name=":43" /&gt; As a challenge to feminist theory, essentialism refers to the problem of theorizing gender as both an identity and a mark of difference. This refers to a problem for the concept of subjectivity presupposed by feminist theories of gender.&lt;ref name=":43" /&gt; There are arguments primarily by black and lesbian feminists that feminist theory has capitalized on the idea of gender essentialism by using the category of gender to appeal to "women's experience" as a whole.&lt;ref name=":43" /&gt; By doing this, feminist theory makes universalizing and normalizing claims for and about women, which are only true of white, Western, heterosexual, [[cisgender]], middle- or upper-class women,&lt;ref name=":43" /&gt; but which it implies are situations, perspectives and experiences true to all women. Patrice DiQuinzio discusses "how critics of exclusion see this as a function of feminist theory's commitment to theorizing gender exclusively and articulating women's experiences in terms of gender alone".&lt;ref name=":43" /&gt; Instead one must theorize feminism in a way that takes the interlocking category of experiences between race, class, gender, and sexuality into consideration; an [[Intersectionality|intersectional]] model of thinking.&lt;ref name=":53" /&gt;

===== Mothering =====

DiQuinzio goes on to discuss how essentialism and exclusion work in relation to motherhood. Feminist theory which has used the idea of woman's essence to link gender socialization with exclusively female mothering, such as [[Nancy Chodorow|Nancy Chodorow's]] work, can be exclusionary and essentialist in the ways that it involves making universalizing and normalizing claims about mothers without taking social, historical, or cultural context into account.&lt;ref name=":43" /&gt; Judith Butler claims that "the effort to characterize a feminine specificity through recourse to maternity, whether biological or social, produce[s] a factionalization and even a disavowal of feminism altogether".&lt;ref name=":33" /&gt; Not all women are mothers; "some cannot be some are too young or too old to be, some choose not to be, and for some who are mothers, that is not necessarily the rallying point of their politicization in feminism".&lt;ref name=":33" /&gt;

===== Transfeminism =====

{{Main|Transfeminism}}
Furthermore, the essentialism of gender in feminist theory presents a problem when understanding transfeminism. Instead of understanding trans studies as another subsection or subjectivity to be subsumed under the category of "woman", we understand the task of trans studies to be "the breaking apart of this category, particularly if that breaking requires a new articulation of the relation between sex and gender, male and female".&lt;ref name=":63"&gt;{{cite book | last = Salamon | first = Gayle | chapter = Transfeminism and the future of gender | chapterurl = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=vEDoLJvklZAC&amp;pg=PA115 | editor-last = Scott| editor-first = Joan Wallach | editor-link = Joan Wallach Scott | title = Women's studies on the edge | publisher = Duke University Press | location = Durham | year = 2008 | isbn = 9780822389101 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Trans subjectivity challenges the binary of gender essentialism as it disrupts the "fixed taxonomies of gender" and this creates a resistance in women's studies, which as a discipline has historically depended upon the fixedness of gender.&lt;ref name=":63" /&gt; The expressions that exist in trans identities break down the very possibility of gender essentialism by queering the binary of gender, gender roles and expectations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last = Jakubowski|first = Kaylee|url = http://everydayfeminism.com/2015/03/trans-people-gender-essentialism/|title = No, the existence of trans people doesn't validate gender essentialism|work = [[Everyday Feminism]]|date = March 9, 2015 | access-date = May 28, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In recent years through the written work of transfeminists like [[Sandy Stone (artist)|Sandy Stone]], the theory around trans women and their inclusion into feminist spaces has opened, just like it has opened in respect to race, class, sexuality and ability historically.

==== Child development ====
Social categories such as gender are often essentialized by not only adults but also children, as young children are recorded to display essentialist beliefs about gender preferences and indications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Meyer | first1 = Meredith | last2 = Gelman | first2 = Susan A. | title = Gender essentialism in children and parents: implications for the development of gender stereotyping and gender-typed preferences | journal = [[Sex Roles (journal)|Sex Roles]] | volume = 75 | issue = 9&amp;ndash;10 | pages = 409&amp;ndash;421 | publisher = [[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]] | doi = 10.1007/s11199-016-0646-6 | date = November 2016 | url = https://doi.org/10.1007/s11199-016-0646-6 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; Proponents of gender essentialism propose that young children from the age of 4 to 10 show the tendency to endorse the role of nature in determining gender-stereotyped properties, an "early bias to view gender categories as predictive of essential" which gradually declines as they pass elementary school years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Taylor | first = Morgan G. | title = The development of children's beliefs about social and biological aspects of gender differences | journal = [[Child Development (journal)|Child Development]] | volume = 67 | issue = 4 | pages = 1555&amp;ndash;1571 | publisher = [[Wiley-Blackwell|Wiley]] | doi = 10.1111/j.1467-8624.1996.tb01814.x | pmid = 8890500 | date = August 1996 | url = https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-8624.1996.tb01814.x | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another indicator of gender essentialism in child development is how they begin to employ essentialist manifestation as a tool for reasoning and perceiving gender stereotyping from as young as 24 months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Poulin-Dubois | first1 = Diane | last2 = Serbin | first2 = Lisa A. | last3 = Eichstedt | first3 = Julie A. | last4 = Sen | first4 = Maya G. | last5 = Beissel | first5 = Clara F. | title = Men don’t put on make-up: toddlers’ knowledge of the gender stereotyping of household activities | journal = Social Development | volume = 11 | issue = 2 | pages = 166&amp;ndash;181 | publisher = [[Wiley-Blackwell|Wiley]] | doi = 10.1111/1467-9507.00193 | date = May 2002 | url = https://doi.org/10.1111/1467-9507.00193 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Post-structuralism ===

{{Main|Post-structuralism}}
{{One source|section|date=October 2017}}

[[Poststructuralism]] indicates "a field of critical practices that cannot be totalized and that, therefore, interrogate the formative and exclusionary power of sexual difference", says Butler.&lt;ref name=":33"&gt;{{cite book | last = Butler | first = Judith|last2 = Wallach Scott|first2 = Joan | author-link1 = Judith Butler | author-link2 = Joan Wallach Scott | title = Feminists theorize the political | publisher = Routledge | location = New York Oxfordshire, England | year = 1992 | isbn = 9780203723999 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, through lens of poststructuralism, the critique of gender essentialism is possible because these poststructuralist theory generates analyses, critiques, and political interventions, and opens up a political imaginary for feminism that otherwise has been constrained.&lt;ref name=":33" /&gt; A feminist poststructuralism does not designate a position from which one operates, but instead it offers a set of tools and terms to be "reused and rethought, exposed as strategic instruments and effects, and subjected to a critical reinscription and redeployment".&lt;ref name=":33" /&gt;

The '''History of Modern Biomedicine Research Group''' ('''HoMBRG''') is an academic organisation specialising in recording and publishing the [[oral history]] of twentieth and twenty-first century [[biomedicine]]. It was established in 1990 as the Wellcome Trust's '''History of Twentieth Century Medicine Group''',&lt;ref name="MHL2013"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.medicalheritage.org/2013/03/13/the-mhl-welcomes-a-new-content-contributor-2/|title=The MHL Welcomes a New Content Contributor|date=13 March 2013|publisher=[[Medical Heritage Library]]|accessdate=6 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and reconstituted in October 2010 as part of the School of History &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.history.qmul.ac.uk/research/research-centres|title=Research Centres - School of History|website=www.history.qmul.ac.uk|accessdate=11 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; at [[Queen Mary University of London]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Trust|first1=Wellcome|title=History of Modern Biomedicine Research Group celebrates 21 years of innovation|url=http://www.wellcome.ac.uk/News/2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.qmul.ac.uk/media/news/items/hss/140113.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Trust|first1=Wellcome|title=History of Modern Biomedicine Research Group celebrates 21 years of innovation|url=http://www.wellcome.ac.uk/News/2014/WTP057432.htm |publisher=[[Wellcome Trust]] |accessdate=29 May 2015|ref=none}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The project originated as The [[Wellcome Trust]]'s History of Twentieth Century Medicine Group, and later functioned as the Academic Unit of the Wellcome Institute for the History of Medicine. It was originally established at the Royal College of Physicians in 1990 and comprised Sir [[Christopher Booth]] (the Harveian Librarian) and Professor [[Tilli Tansey]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Aronson|first1=Jeff |title=Wellcome witnesses to twentieth-century medicine |journal=Cambridge Journal Medical History |date=July 1998 |volume=42 |issue=3 |pages=404–405 |pmc=1044055}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its purpose was to devise ways of stimulating historians, scientists &amp; clinicians to discuss, preserve and write the history of recent biomedicine. The Group's activities were originally overseen by a Programme Committee, which included professional historians of medicine, practising scientists and clinicians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pickstone|first1=John V.|title=A brief history of medical history|url=http://www.history.ac.uk/makinghistory/resources/articles/history_of_medicine.html |publisher=Making History|accessdate=31 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 2000–2010 it was a constituent part of the Wellcome Trust Centre for the History of Medicine at University College London. In October 2010 it moved to the School of History, Queen Mary’s University, London.  In 2011 the Group received a Strategic Award from the Wellcome Trust to embark upon a new project, "Makers of Modern Biomedicine".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Society|first1=The Physiological|title=Hidden voices and human stories|url=https://www.physoc.org/news/2012/hidden-voices-and-human-stories |publisher=The Physiological Society|accessdate=29 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://search.wellcomelibrary.org/iii/encore/search/C__SHistory+of+Biomedicine+Research+Group.+__Orightresult;jsessionid=F0C74ABF559F644E711241B44A7FAD7E?lang=eng&amp;suite=cobalt|title=Wellcome Library Encore -- History+of+Biomedicine+Research+Group.+|website=search.wellcomelibrary.org|accessdate=11 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Culture24-2012"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.culture24.org.uk/science-and-nature/medicine/art375045|title=Five-year, £1.4 million project to reveal "unsung heroes" of biomedicine|date=31 January 2012|work=Culture24|accessdate=6 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://genmedhist.eshg.org/news-events/|title=News &amp; Events|work=Genetics and Medicine Historical Network|publisher=[[Cardiff University]]|accessdate=6 May 2017 |quote=The History of Modern Biomedicine Research Group, based at Queen Mary, University of London, continue to build upon their work documenting the recent history of clinical genetics research and practice. }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="UniOfSurrey"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.surrey.ac.uk/features/pioneering-work-biomedicine-celebrated|title=Pioneering work in biomedicine celebrated|date=25 August 2015|publisher=[[University of Surrey]]|accessdate=6 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Outputs ==

An archive of oral and written history, plus videoed interviews, has been compiled by the HoMBRG and consists of three projects: Witness Seminars, Today's Neuroscience, Tomorrow's History and SAD at 30. All material and documentation related to the project is deposited with the Wellcome Library.  The resultant publications are open access,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Medical Humanities|first1=Centre for|title=New Open Access Publication – The Development of Narrative Practices in Medicine c.1960–c.2000|url=http://centreformedicalhumanities.org/new-open-access-publication-the-development-of-narrative-practices-in-medicine-c-1960-c-2000/ |publisher=[[Durham University]] |accessdate=31 May 2015|ref=none}}&lt;/ref&gt; and made freely available online via the HoMBRG website, a partnership with the Medical Heritage Library,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Library|first1=Medical History|title=The MHL Welcomes a New Content Contributor|url=http://www.medicalheritage.org/2013/03/the-mhl-welcomes-a-new-content-contributor-2/|website=Medical History Library|publisher=Medical History Library|accessdate=29 May 2015|ref=none}}&lt;/ref&gt; and iTunes.&lt;ref name="apple.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://itunes.apple.com/gb/itunes-u/todays-neuroscience-tomorrows/id557520467?mt=10|title=Today's Neuroscience, Tomorrow's History - Professor Sir Peter Mansfield - Free Podcast by Queen Mary University of London on Apple Podcasts|website=Apple Podcasts|accessdate=11 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Resources from the archive are online at The History of Modern Biomedicine Archive&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The History of Modern Biomedicine|url=http://histmodbiomed.org/article/projects |publisher=Queen Mary, University of London|accessdate=31 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the internet archive&lt;ref&gt;https://archive.org/search.php?query=publisher%3A%22London%3A+The+History+of+Modern+Biomedicine+Research+Group+at+UCL%22&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Today's Neuroscience, Tomorrow's History ===

The Group's 'Today's Neuroscience, Tomorrow's History' initiative (2006-2008) was funded by a Wellcome Trust Public Engagement grant. It recorded interviews on three themes, [[neuropharmacology]], [[psychiatry]]/[[neuropsychology]], and [[neuroimaging]], with twelve neuroscientists, including [[Geoffrey Burnstock]], [[Salvador Moncada]], [[Michael Rutter]] and [[Uta Frith]].&lt;ref name="TNTH"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.histmodbiomed.org/article/about-todays-neuroscience-tomorrows-history|title=About Today's Neuroscience, Tomorrow's History|publisher=HoMBRG|accessdate=11 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The Witness Seminars ===

A series of [[witness seminar]]s began in 1993, with regular meetings being held, about four per year.  These recorded the voices of those who have contributed, in diverse ways, to the development of modern [[biomedicine]], using oral history methodology.  The aim is to make the series widely available for education, research and outreach purposes.&lt;ref name=JonesEM&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Jones|editor1-first=E.M.|editor2-last=Tansey|editor2-first=E.M.|title=Monoclonal Antibodies to Migraine: Witnesses to Modern Biomedicine, An A-Z|date=2014|publisher=Queen Mary, University of London|location=London|isbn=978 0 90223 895 4|pages=223|ref=none|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://patient.info/forums/discuss/migraine-diagnosis-treatment-and-understanding-270038|title=Migraine: Diagnosis, Treatment and Understanding  - Migraine - Patient|website=patient.info|accessdate=11 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jones2016"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jones|first=Emma M.|year=2016|title=A witness seminar on the history of the Human Gene Mapping Workshops|journal=Gene|volume=589|issue=2|pages=123–126|issn=0378-1119|doi=10.1016/j.gene.2016.02.030|pmc=4925380}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Messenger"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://waste-management-world.com/a/an-oral-history-of-waste-management-by-university-historians-in-london|title=An Oral History of Waste Management by University Historians in London|last=Messenger|first=Ben|date=15 January 2016|work=Waste Management World|accessdate=6 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Tansey2016"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tansey|first1=T  |first2=A. |last2=Wilkinson |first3=A. |last3=Yabsley |first4=A. |last4=Zarros |year=2016|title=Physiology at the heart of modern biomedicine: Evidence through oral testimonies|journal=Proceedings of the Physiological Society|publisher=[[The Physiological Society]]|volume=37}}&lt;/ref&gt; The results are published online,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Routledge| isbn = 978-1-134-70170-4| last1 = McConville| first1 = Sean| last2 = Bryson| first2 = Anna| title = The Routledge Guide to Interviewing: Oral History, Social Enquiry and Investigation |year=2013 |page=149}}&lt;/ref&gt; with most edited transcripts appearing within 18 months.&lt;ref name=JonesEM/&gt;

The first two volumes were reviewed in ''[[Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine]]'' in 1999, with the comment, "Few books are so intellectually stimulating or uplifting."&lt;ref name="BlauJN"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Blau|first=J N|year=1999|title=Wellcome Witnesses to Twentieth Century Medicine, Vols 1 and 2|journal=Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine|volume=92|pages=206–8}} &lt;!--PMC1297150 --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Reviewing the series in the ''[[British Medical Journal]]'' in 2002, medical historian [[Irvine Loudon]] wrote, "This is oral history at its best...all the volumes make compulsive reading...they are, primarily, important historical records&lt;ref name="Loudon2002"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Loudon|first=I.|year=2002|title=Book: Wellcome Witnesses to Twentieth Century Medicine|journal=BMJ|volume=325|issue=7372|pages=1119a–1119|issn=0959-8138|doi=10.1136/bmj.325.7372.1119/a}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014 a seminar, chaired by Professor Sir Brian Follett, with [[Norman Rosenthal]] and [[Alfred Lewy]], entitled 'The Recent History of [[Seasonal Affective Disorder]] (SAD): 30 Years of SAD' was undertaken on the topic of Seasonal Affective Disorder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Association|first1=SAD|title=Wellcome Trust Wtness Seminar:An Important New Publication|url=http://www.sada.org.uk/sada_get_news_item.php?action=show&amp;id=34-3-News |publisher=SAD Association|accessdate=31 May 2015|ref=none}}&lt;/ref&gt; This resulted in a number of podcasts,&lt;ref name="apple.com"/&gt; and Volume 51 of the Witness Seminar publications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Overy|editor1-first=C|editor2-last=Tansey|editor2-first=E.M.|title=The Recent History Of Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD)|date=2014|publisher=Queen Mary, University of London|location=London|isbn=978 0 90223 897 8|url=http://ischronobiology.org/Joomla_1.5.26-Stable-Full_Package/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=109:the-recent-history-of-seasonal-affective-disorder&amp;catid=45:books&amp;Itemid=68|accessdate=29 May 2015|ref=none|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Clips and Conversations ===

In 2015 the Group began producing oral history interviews with notable scientists and clinicians.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="37042">{{About|the economic impact of farmers' markets in the U.S|the commercial enterprise|Farmers' market}}

[[Farmers' market]]s are markets in which producers sell directly to [[consumer]]s. While farmers' markets do not have a measurable impact on the [[economy of the United States|United States economy]] as a whole, many studies have found that farmers' markets impact [[U.S. state|state]] and [[municipality|municipal]] economies as well as [[vendor]]s, local [[business]]es, and [[consumer]]s. These impacts are measured using the IMPLAN Input-Output Model and the Sticky Economic Evaluation Device (SEED), in addition to other methods. The economic impacts that are most frequently measured include effects on the [[revenue]] and [[income]] of local growers and local businesses, the effects on job creation, and the effects on other [[economic sector|sectors]] of state and local economies. Some obstacles that may reduce impact or create negative economic effects include [[market saturation|over-saturation]], [[socioeconomics|socioeconomic barriers]], the [[opportunity cost]] of farmers' markets, and the projected unsustainable growth of farmers' markets in the [[United States]].

==Methodology==
Researchers use different methods to calculate the economic impact of farmers' markets on [[economy|economies]] in the [[United States]]. The reason to include [[methodology|methodologies]] in this article is to demonstrate how impact is measured differently, which influences the findings and conclusions of the studies. The most common methods used are the IMPLAN Input-Output Model and the Sticky Economic Evaluation Device, which are mostly used to calculate the impact of farmers' markets on state, [[municipality|municipal]], and local [[economy|economies]].

===IMPLAN input-output model===
The IMPLAN input-output model is a quantitative economic [[software]], technique, or [[data]] that facilitates [[analysis]] of spending.&lt;ref name=IMPLAN&gt;{{cite web|title=IMPLAN|website=IMPLAN.com|url = http://www.implan.com|access-date=25 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This analytic tool, created by the [[U.S. Forest Service]] and the [[University of Minnesota]], uses the [[Bureau of Economic Analysis|Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA)]] [[Input–output model|input-output]] criterion combined with other data to compile tables that identify [[cash flow]]s between different [[economic sector|sectors]] of the [[economy]]. IMPLAN methodology has been used in studies on Portland and [[Iowa]]n farmers' markets to calculate the economic impact by studying consumption-based transactions. It is also used to compute data supporting studies on the impact of farmers' markets on [[vendor]] [[revenue]].&lt;ref name=IMPLAN /&gt;

===Sticky Economic Evaluation Device (SEED)===
Market Umbrella is a [[nonprofit organization]] that developed the Sticky Economic Evaluation Device (SEED), a tool that measures the economic impact of a [[market (place)|public market]] on neighboring businesses. SEED multiplies the annual [[revenue]] generated by [[consumer]]s of the [[market (economics)|market]] and abutting businesses by the multiplier. Specifically, the Regional Input-Output Modeling System II multiplier is used, which is generated by the BEA ([http://BEA.gov BEA]). The RIMS II multiplier measures how many dollars remain in the regional or local [[economy]]. "The greater the interaction each dollar has with the local economy, the larger the multiplier." This methodology also gathers information through [[survey methodology|customer-intercept surveys]] and head count tabulation in order to calculate the economic impact the market has on its [[region]]. Market Umbrella provides markets with access to their survey templates and facilitates report generating through the use of online accounts on their website. The [[sales taxes in the United States|sales tax]] revenue generated by market consumers, including purchases at neighboring businesses, is additionally captured. The SEED methodology, developed with farmers' markets in mind, has been used to measure the economic impact of Crescent City Farmers' Markets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is SEED?|url=http://www.marketumbrella.org/index.php?page=seed-learn}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economic impact on the U.S. economy and its regions==
There are few studies that focus on the impact of farmers' markets on the United States economy and on regional economies in the U.S. The [[USDA]] has the most research surrounding regional variation and overall composition of farmers' markets.

===Impact on U.S. economy===
In 2012, the [[output (economics)|output]] generated by [[United States]] [[farm]]s contributed $166.9 billion to [[gross domestic product]], which was 1 percent of [[GDP]]. This figure includes all farms participating in economic activity, which suggests that the total contribution of [[farmers' market]]s to the [[economy of the United States|U.S. economy]] in terms of [[output (economics)|output]] is very small.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Agriculture and Food Sectors and the Economy|url=http://ers.usda.gov/data-products/ag-and-food-statistics-charting-the-essentials/ag-and-food-sectors-and-the-economy.aspx.|website=USDA|publisher=USDA Economic Research Service|accessdate=19 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, the number of farmers' markets in the [[United States]] is growing rapidly, with [[economic growth|growth]] increasing by 8.6 percent per year on [[average]]. About 30 percent of these new markets are less than five years old and most of them report sales that are half the national [[average]]. These new markets have on average 22 [[vendor]]s compared to the national average of 31, and 430 [[customer]]s per week compared to the national average of 959. This explains why the growth in sales from $888 million in 2000 to $1 billion in 2005 was only 2.5 percent in spite of the rapid growth in the number of farmers' markets. The [[revenue]] generated from farmers' markets was $31,923 per month according to a 2005 [[USDA]] study.&lt;ref name=survey&gt;{{cite web|title=National Farmers Market Manager Survey|url=http://www.ams.usda.gov/AMSv1.0/getfile?dDocName=STELPRDC5077203.|publisher=USDA|accessdate=19 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Farmers' Market Sales by County.jpg|thumb|This map shows that the Far West and the mid-Atlantic regions of the United States have the most profitable farmers' markets.]]

===Regional variation===
The [[region]]s that have the most lucrative farmers' markets are the Far West and the [[Mid-Atlantic states|mid-Atlantic region]]. Managers of farmers' markets reported in a 2005 study that about 15 percent of the [[vendor]]s at their [[markets|market]] earned between $25,000 and $100,000 annually. This range was the largest reported level of [[income]] across the regions. The North Central and Rocky Mountain regions in contrast experienced the lowest level of [[sales]] with [[revenues|revenue]] between $1,000 and $5,000. This may be due in part to the [[seasonality|seasonal]] variability of different [[region]]s. The markets in the [[Rocky Mountains|Rocky Mountain]] region were open on [[average]] only 3.92 months, while markets in the Far West were open for 4.9 months on average. The Far West also experienced the greatest level of sales with $476,733 per market per year, while the Rocky Mountain region experienced the lowest level of sales with $90,169 per market per year.&lt;ref name=survey /&gt;

==Economic impact on states and cities==
Many studies assess the impact of [[farmers' market]]s in the United States on state economies and [[municipality|municipal]] economies. Most of these studies find that farmers' markets benefit state and local economies because they have direct and indirect effects on personal [[income]], job creation, and on [[output (economics)|output]] generated in other [[economic sector|sectors]] of the economy including [[manufacturing]] and [[transportation]].

===Iowa===
The Iowa Department of Agriculture and Land Stewardship conducted a study in 2009 to measure the economic impact of farmers' markets in [[Iowa]] using the IMPLAN Input-Output (I-O) model. Iowa is fourth in the nation in terms of its number of farmers' markets and ranks second in terms of the number of farmers' markets [[per capita]].

The report shows that [[sales]] among Iowa farmers' markets increased by 92 percent since 2004, reaching $38.4 million in [[sales]] in 2009. The tables entitled "Market sales per city, 2004" and "Market sales per city, 2009" show the overall increase in sales among different areas of Iowa between 2004 and 2009.

Using the IMPLAN I-O model, the $38.4 million in farmers' market sales translated into "$59.4 million of gross sales among sectors in the Iowa [[economy]]." Additionally, the I-O model found that $12.2 million was linked to "personal [[income]] effects directly or indirectly related to farmers' market activity." The study also concluded that 374 jobs were directly linked to farmers' market activity, while 200 jobs were "indirectly attributed to the activity."&lt;ref name=Otto /&gt;

The 2009 report also focused on how farmers' markets affect other [[economic sector|sectors]] of the Iowan economy. The two sectors of the economy most impacted by farmers' market activity were [[agriculture]] and [[mining]] and [[wholesale]] and [[retail]] [[trade]]. The direct impact on agriculture and mining was about $24,960,000, with another $1 million in "business-related indirect impact" and "consumer-related induced impact." [[Construction]], [[manufacturing]], [[transportation]], [[finance]], [[professional services]], and [[tertiary sector of the economy|personal services]] were not directly impacted, but between $1 million and $4 million generated in each sector reflected indirect and induced impacts of farmers' market activity. The table entitled "Output impact of Iowa farmers' market activities" shows these impacts.&lt;ref name=Otto /&gt;

===Portland, Oregon===
The City of [[Portland, Oregon|Portland's]] Office of Sustainable Development (OSD) commissioned a report in 2008 to study the impact of Portland's 14 farmers' markets on "the regional Portland metro-area economy." The 14 farmers' markets studied in Portland had [[sales]] of approximately $11.2 million in the aggregate in 2007.

The study found that the direct impact of "spending at farmers' markets" stays within the [[region]], while sales at the traditional [[grocery store]] "leak outside the region." Therefore, the estimated direct impact of $11.2 million in farmers' market spending is equivalent to only $3.4 million "in economic impact in a traditional grocery market" due to [[importation]] of [[good (economics)|goods]] and [[household]] [[margin (economics)|marginal]] decision-making in the [[retail|retail sector]].

Using the IMPLAN Input-Output Model, the study also measured the economic impact of [[product (business)|product]] sales, prepared [[food]] sales, and management fees, or "the payment of market management [[fee]]s by vendors," on [[output (economics)|output]], [[employment]], and employee [[wage|compensation]] in the Portland [[economy]].

The study concluded that the 14 markets in Portland produced approximately $17 million in output, 150 jobs, and $3.2 million in employee compensation. The table entitled "Total est. economic impact of 14 Portland-area farmers' markets, 2007" shows how product sales, prepared food sales, and management fees impacted the Portland economy in 2007.&lt;ref name=Yosick&gt;{{cite web|last1=Yosick|first1=Bonnie Gee|title=Economic Impact of Portland's Farmers Markets|url=https://www.portlandoregon.gov/bps/article/236588|website=The City of Portland Oregon|publisher=Bonnie Gee Yosick LLC|accessdate=19 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Crescent City Farmers' Market, New Orleans, Louisiana===
Using the SEED [[methodology]], marketumbrella.org analyzed the economic impact of Crescent City Farmers' Market-Mid City, Crescent City Farmers' Market-CBD, and Crescent City Farmers' Market-Upt, in [[New Orleans]], [[Louisiana]] on [[vendor]]s, the "host [[neighborhood]]," and the "surrounding [[region]]."&lt;ref name=SEED&gt;{{cite web|title=Sticky Economic Evaluation Device: Measuring the Financial Impact of a Public Market|url=http://www.crescentcityfarmersmarket.org/uploads/file/Crescent_City_Farmers_Market_x3_2012-20121021.pdf|publisher=Marketumbrella.org|accessdate=19 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The combined economic impact included vendor [[revenue]], the revenue of nearby [[business]]es, and [[sales taxes in the United States|sales tax]] revenue. The combined impact of the Crescent City Farmers' markets was $6,655,614.52 on vendor revenue, $5,008,742.34 on neighborhood business revenue, and $236,014.04 on [[municipality|municipal]] and [[state tax levels in the United States|state tax]] revenue.&lt;ref name=SEED /&gt;

Crescent City Farmers Mkt-Mid City was reported to have a market impact of $984,555.13 on vendors and a neighboring business impact of $936,714.04 for a combined annual economic impact of $1,921,269.17. During the 51 days of operation throughout the year, the market generated [[municipal]] and state [[sales taxes in the United States|sales tax]] revenue of $44,138.36.&lt;ref name=SEED /&gt;

In its 51 days of operation, Crescent City Farmers Mkt-CBD generated $3,150,982.42 for vendors and $2,657,647.23 for neighboring businesses with a combined annual economic impact of $5,808,629.66. The revenue for municipal and state sales taxes was projected at $125,229.45 annually.&lt;ref name=SEED /&gt;

Lastly, Crescent City Farmers Mkt-Upt generated $2,520,076.97 for vendors and $1,414,381.06 for neighboring businesses, for a combined economic impact of $3,934,458.03. Municipal and State sales tax revenue was projected at $66,646.23.&lt;ref name=SEED /&gt;

==Economic impacts on U.S. vendors, businesses, and consumers==
[[Farmers' market]]s directly impact [[vendor]]s, [[business]]es, and [[consumer]]s. Farmers' markets influence these individuals through [[vendor]] [[revenue]] and [[sales]], the income [[multiplier (economics)|multiplier]] effect, local [[business incubator|business incubation]], [[employment]], and [[consumer]] [[preference (economics)|preferences]]. Many studies concentrate on the impact of farmers' markets on vendors, businesses, and consumers because farmers' markets are a local phenomenon whose effects are most observable at the community or individual level. This section differs from the previous section that highlighted some [[U.S. state|state]] and [[municipality|municipal]] studies because it provides a summary of the general impacts almost all state and municipal studies measure.

===Impact on total vendor sales===
Farmers' markets generate significant economic benefits to farmers' market [[vendor]]s. A study shows that vendors who participated in nine [[market (economics)|markets]] throughout [[urban area|urban centers]] like [[Baltimore]] and [[Los Angeles]] collectively earn $52,000 to $40,594,000 per year from [[sales]]. Kamm's Corners Farmers Market, the [[median]] market studied, generated $1.8 million per year for vendors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Farmers Markets Contribute Millions to Local, Regional Economies|url=http://www.marketumbrella.org/index.php?mact=News,cntnt01,detail,0&amp;cntnt01articleid=163&amp;cntnt01returnid=83.|website=Market Umbrella|publisher=Market Umbrella|accessdate=19 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Vendors value the [[net profit]]s derived from the [[market (economics)|market]], as almost [[one half|half]] of the vendors [[survey methodology|surveyed]] in a study on Iowa's farmers' markets indicated that they would incur a significant loss if farmers' markets were to close down.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Otto|first1=D.|last2=Varner|first2=T.|title=Vendors and the Economic Importance of Iowa's Farmers' Markets: An Economic Impact Survey Analysis}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Impact on vendor revenue===
[[Vendor]]s generally make more money by selling their [[product (business)|products]] to the local [[community]] than by selling them to a [[wholesale]]r for use in the conventional [[food system]]. One study found that [[vendor]]s and food [[producer (agriculture)|producers]] were able to retain almost, if not all, of the [[revenue]] from the sale of their product on the local [[market (economics)|market]]. Vendors may receive up to "seven times greater net [[revenue]] on a per unit basis" in the local market than in the conventional market.  It is also easier for vendors at farmers' markets to gauge consumer [[demand]] and [[price]] their products accordingly because they are able to interact directly with the [[population]] that they serve.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=O'Hara|first1=J.K.|title=Market Forces: Creating Jobs through Public Investment in Local and Regional Food Systems|url=http://www.ucsusa.org/sites/default/files/legacy/assets/documents/food_and_agriculture/market-forces-report.pdf.|accessdate=19 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Impact on vendor incentives===
Vendors who participate in farmers' markets usually have another, often primary form of [[employment]]. So, selling their goods at the market is usually a residual use of their time. One study suggests that participating in farmers' markets may reduce the [[incentive]]s of small [[farm]] growers to expand their farms and become more [[efficiency|efficient]] because they must dedicate significant time to [[marketing]] activities. This suggests that vendor [[profit (economics)|profits]] may not increase by as much as they could due to the time dedicated to marketing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Martinez|first1=S.|title=Local Food Systems: Concepts, Impacts, and Issues|url=http://www.ers.usda.gov/media/122868/err97_1_.pdf|publisher=USDA|accessdate=19 December 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141021054917/http://www.ers.usda.gov/media/122868/err97_1_.pdf|archivedate=21 October 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Income multiplier effect===
Beyond the direct effects on vendors, farmers' markets also produce indirect effects.  Farmers use the sales that they garner from the [[market (economics)|market]] to purchase [[fertilizer]], [[seed]]s, and other [[factors of production|inputs of production]] from [[business]]es. This type of [[financial transaction|transaction]] has income [[multiplier (economics)|multiplier]] effects, meaning that farmers' markets not only impact vendor [[income]], but also impact the [[income]]s of businesses linked to the [[production (economics)|production]] of [[commodity|commodities]] sold at the [[market (economics)|markets]]. A study focusing on Iowa farmers' markets showed that $12.2 million worth of business [[income]] was due to farmers' market-related transactions among vendors.  Another study found that almost all of the "wage and business proprietor income in local food supply chains is retained locally."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=King|first1=R.P.|title=Comparing the Structure, Size, and Performance of Local and Mainstream Food Supply Chains|url=http://www.ers.usda.gov/media/122609/err99_1_.pdf|publisher=USDA|accessdate=19 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Local business incubation===
Farmers' markets can support local [[business]]es. A 2002 study found that sixty percent of [[consumer]]s at farmers' markets also visited [[retail store|stores]] surrounding the market on the same day. Sixty percent of those consumers also indicated they only visited stores surrounding the farmers' market on days that they visited the market. Another study supports these findings and showed that an "overwhelming majority" of customers at farmers' markets also visited at least one nearby store.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Measuring the Impact of Public Markets and Farmers Markets on Local Economies|url=http://www.pps.org/reference/measuring-the-impact-of-public-markets-and-farmers-markets-on-local-economies/|website=Project for Public Spaces|accessdate=19 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Additionally, the farmers' market itself provides a space for local and small [[farm]] growers to innovate and respond directly to consumer demand. Sweet Briar Farms in [[Eugene, Oregon|Eugene]], [[Oregon]] began selling [[pork]] cuts at the [[Eugene, Oregon|Eugene]] and [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]] farmers' markets in 2000. In the last ten years, the company has expanded to producing [[bacon]] and [[sausage]] as well as [[spice]]s, [[sauce]]s, and [[spice rub|rubs]]. The company now has 25 [[laborer|workers]] and is one of the biggest [[pork]] providers in the [[Willamette Valley]] of [[Oregon]]. The company credits much of its success to the ability to sell new, experimental products at farmers' markets.&lt;ref name=Bragg&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bragg|first1=E.|title=Farmers Markets as Small Business Incubators|url=http://blogs.usda.gov/2010/09/01/farmers-markets-as-small-business-incubators/|accessdate=19 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Job creation===
A study of Iowa's farmers' markets showed that 140 jobs were created in a single year that could be attributed to farmers' market activity.&lt;ref name=Bragg /&gt;  Other studies also found that farmers' market activity directly and indirectly supports the growth of local jobs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=King|first1=R.P.|title=Comparing the Structure, Size, and Performance of Local and Mainstream Food Supply CHains|url=http://www.ers.usda.gov/media/122609/err99_1_.pdf|publisher=USDA|accessdate=19 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One study showed that 5.4 jobs were created per farmers' market.  This figure was used to suggest that public [[funding]] of 100 to 500 'otherwise-unsuccessful' farmers' markets per year could generate 13,500 jobs in five years.&lt;ref name=Hennenberry&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hennenberry|first1=S.R.|last2=Whitacre|first2=B.|last3=Agustini|first3=H.N.|title=An Evaluation of the Economic Impacts of Oklahoma Farmers Markets|journal=Journal of Food Distribution Research|date=2009|volume=40|issue=3|pages=64–78}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Direct-to-Consumer Sales versus Total Agricultural Sales.gif|thumb|This [[United States Department of Agriculture|USDA]] graph shows that direct-to-consumer sales have "outpaced" total agricultural sales.]]

===Impact on consumers===
Farmers' markets address local [[consumer]] [[demand]] and [[preference (economics)|preferences]]. The number of farmers' markets in the United States has grown from 340 in 1970 to 7,000 in 2011. There are also over 4,000 [[community-supported agriculture|CSAs]]  in the United States, which shows that consumers want to buy local [[food]].   Consumers that go to farmers' markets generally seek to support local farms and businesses and also seek to buy food that is [[health]]y and [[sustainable agriculture|sustainably produced]]. Recent national [[data]] show that eighty-two percent of consumers go to farmers' markets to get fresh [[produce]], seventy-five percent go to support the local economy, and fifty-eight percent patron these markets because they want to know the source of the products they buy.  Farmers' markets serve a [[demand]] not satisfied by the mass-produced and consolidated methods of production of the United States food system. Consumers also benefit from increased information, because they can learn about where the food they buy comes from by speaking with farmers at the market.&lt;ref name=Hennenberry /&gt;

==Economic impact obstacles==
Although the number of farmers' markets has grown substantially in the [[United States]] over the last decade, there are some factors that may hinder the overall impact of farmers' markets or create negative effects. Overcoming some of these obstacles will ensure the [[profit (economics)|profitability]] of farmers' markets while producing positive [[spillover effect]]s on neighboring markets.

===Over-saturation===
A negative effect on sales of Iowa farmers' markets was linked to the creation of new farmers' markets, specifically with regard to [[location (geography)|location]] and timing. Agriculture Statistician Theresa Varner and Professor of Economics Daniel Otto stated that [[competition]] was a factor affecting [[sales]] of farmers' markets in [[Iowa]]. They identified a conflict based on the days that markets operated and suggested that already existing farmers' markets should be improved and expanded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Varner|first1=Theresa|last2=Otto|first2=Danie|title=Factors Affecting Sales at Farmers' Markets: An Iowa Study|journal=Applied Economic Perspectives and Policy|date=2008|volume=30|issue=1|pages=176–189|url=http://aepp.oxfordjournals.org/content/30/1/176.full|doi=10.1111/j.1467-9353.2007.00398.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Percentage of Farmers' Markets that Accept SNAP Benefits by County.jpg|thumb|This map shows by county, which farmers' markets accept [[Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program|SNAP]] benefits.]]

===Barriers===
The Appalachian Sustainable Agriculture Project (ASAP) analyzed the various barriers [[low-income]] individuals face with regard to farmers' markets. The study collected data that highlighted [[convenience]], product pricing, language and cultural barriers, [[food and nutrition service|federal nutrition benefits]], and lack of information and awareness as some of the obstacles to participating in farmers' markets. 
	Low-income families and individuals asserted that convenience is a significant [[incentive]] in regard to their shopping [[preference (economics)|preferences]]. Such convenience is provided by 24-hour access, one-stop shopping, consistent product availability, or proximity of markets to public [[transportation]], home, or other regularly accessed places. This convenience is not equally replicated by seasonally driven farmers' markets. Although recent studies have shown farmers' markets to offer competitive [[price]]s, some low-income shoppers still identify high prices as a barrier. Additionally, low-income consumers prefer the [[grocery store]] price structure and price displays. Promotions resulted in a significant factor for almost half of Oregon food stamp customers surveyed. Participation in farmers' markets was hindered by language barriers. Low-income customers in several studies who did not speak [[English language|English]] said participating in these markets was troublesome. The inability or the perception of the inability to process [[Electronic Benefit Transfer]] (EBT) cards by some farmers' markets are major barriers for customers that depend on [[Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program]] (SNAP) benefits.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last = Freedman|first = Darcy A.|last2 = Vaudrin|first2 = Nicole|last3 = Schneider|first3 = Christine|last4 = Trapl|first4 = Erika|last5 = Ohri-Vachaspati|first5 = Punam|last6 = Taggart|first6 = Morgan|last7 = Ariel Cascio|first7 = M.|last8 = Walsh|first8 = Colleen|last9 = Flocke|first9 = Susan|date = 2016-03-25|title = Systematic Review of Factors Influencing Farmers' Market Use Overall and among Low-Income Populations|journal = Journal of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics|doi = 10.1016/j.jand.2016.02.010|issn = 2212-2672|pmid = 27021526|volume=116|issue = 7|pages=1136–55}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lastly a lack of experience and knowledge with fresh food among low-income communities conflicts with market participation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Local Food Research Center|title=Farmers' Markets for All: Exploring Barriers and Opportunities for Increasing Fresh Food Access by Connecting Low-Income Communities with Farmers' Markets|journal=Appalachian Sustainable Agriculture Program|date=October 2012|url=http://asapconnections.org/downloads/asap-farmers-markets-for-all-full-report.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Opportunity cost===
Research entitled ''Evaluating the Economic Impact of Farmers' Markets Using an Opportunity Cost Framework'' was conducted on farmers' markets in [[West Virginia]]. Researchers intended to illustrate that [[opportunity cost]] reduced net positive impact, however, not disproportionately. They distributed the impact of opportunity cost in the West Virginian economy by major industries. These industries were: agriculture-resources, Mining-utilities-construction, manufacturing, trade-transportation, financial activities, professional-technical services, educational-health-social services, entertainment-travel-other services, and government. The sectors that presented a more significant impact were agriculture-resources and trade-transportation. Education-health-social services were affected by secondary impacts. Total job impacts were felt in the trade-transportation and agriculture-resources sectors. So while the data affirms that farmers' markets have a positive effect on the local economy of West Virginia the opportunity costs reduces its positive impact significantly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hughes|first1=David|last2=Brown|first2=Cheryl|last3=Miller|first3=Stacy|last4=McConnell|first4=Tom|title=Evaluating the Economic Impact of Farmers' Markets Using an Opportunity Cost Framework|journal=Journal of Agricultural and Applied Economics|date=April 2008|pages=253–256|url=http://ageconsearch.umn.edu/bitstream/45523/2/jaae-40-01-253.pdf|accessdate=1 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Unsustainable growth===
While farmers' markets are growing rapidly there is data indicating that a significant number of markets fail in [[Oregon]]. The study conducted by [[Oregon State University]] analyzed data collected from the Oregon Farmers' Market Association (OFMA) and the [[Oregon Department of Agriculture]] (ODA) to identify the various factors that were prevalent in the markets that closed in that state. They identified that markets that failed had a short life span. Their research stated that 50 percent of these failed markets closed after their first season. They noted that older markets could also be prone to failure. Data presented a high manager turnover rate of an average of 30 percent between 1999 and 2005. While analyzing the data, researchers were presented with a set of circumstances dependent on each other. A farmers' market needs resources such as [[Volunteering|volunteer]]s, and these resources are affected by market administrative revenue. In small markets, there are fewer vendors, which attracts a smaller percentage of customers. [[administrator (business)|Administrative]] revenue could aid in acquiring more resources, yet small markets cannot supply a significant number of resources. Larger markets are typically better off. Researchers then concluded that market size, administrative revenue, manager turnover, and resource needs were key factors in projecting market failure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stephenson|first1=Garry|last2=Lev|first2=Larry|last3=Brewer|first3=Linda|title=When Things Don't Work: Some Insights into Why Farmers' Markets Close|journal=Oregon State University Extension Service|date=December 2006|url=http://snakeroot.net/mffm/Pubs/sr1073.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Indic Computing''' means "computing in [[Brahmic family|Indic]]" i.e. Indian Scripts and Languages. It involves developing [[software]] in [[Languages of India|Indic Scripts/languages]], [[Input method]]s, [[Language localization|Localization]] of computer applications, [[web development]], [[Database management system|Database Management]], [[Spell checkers]], [[Speech to Text]] and [[Text to Speech]] applications and [[OCR in Indian Languages|OCR in Indian languages]].

Most of the widely used Indic scripts are encoded in [[Indic Unicode|Unicode]] for working on Computers and Internet. As of version 10.0, [[Bengali script|Bengali]], [[Devanagari]], [[Gujarati script|Gujarati]], [[Gurmukhi]], [[Kannada]], [[Limbu script|Limbu]], [[Malayalam]], [[Masaram Gondi alphabet|Masaram Gondi]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode10.0.0/ Unicode 10.0]&lt;/ref&gt;,  [[Newar language|Newari]], [[Ol Chiki alphabet|Ol Chiki]], [[Oriya language|Oriya]], [[Sinhala alphabet|Sinhala]], [[Tamil language|Tamil]] and [[Telugu script|Telugu]] scripts are encoded and supported. Historically used writing systems like [[Arwi]]&lt;ref name="U8"&gt;[https://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode8.0.0/  Unicode 8.0]&lt;/ref&gt;, [[Ahom alphabet]]&lt;ref name="U8"/&gt;, [[Grantha script|Grantha]]&lt;ref name="U7"&gt; [https://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode7.0.0/ Unicode 7.0]&lt;/ref&gt;, [[Khudabadi script|Khudabadi]]&lt;ref name="U7"/&gt;, [[Mahajani]]&lt;ref name="U7"/&gt;, [[Modi alphabet]]&lt;ref name="U7"/&gt;, [[Siddham script]]&lt;ref name="U7"/&gt;, [[Syloti Nagri]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode4.1.0/ Unicode 4.1]&lt;/ref&gt;, [[Tirhuta]]&lt;ref name="U7"/&gt; are also included. Some more Indic scripts are in development and will be included in unicode, for instance [[Tulu Script]].

A lot of Indic Computing projects are going on. They involve some government sector companies, some volunteer groups and individual people.

==Government sector==

==Input methods==
[[File:Multilingual Indic Keyboard Options.png|thumb|Reverie Keypad lists the supported Indian languages for typing, in Android|150px]]

===Full size keyboards===
With the advent of [[Unicode]] inputting Indic text on computer has become very easy. A number of methods exist for this purpose, but the main ones are:-

====InScript====
{{main article|InScript Typing}}

[[Inscript]] is the standard keyboard for Indian languages. Developed by [[C-DAC]] and standardized by Government of India. Nowadays it comes inbuilt in all major operating systems including [[Microsoft Windows]] (2000, XP, Vista, 7), [[Linux]] and [[Macintosh]].

====Phonetic transliteration====
This is a typing method in which, for instance, the user types text in an Indian language using [[Latin alphabet|Roman]] characters and it is phonetically converted to equivalent text in Indian script in real time. This type of conversion is done by phonetic text editors, word processors and software plugins. Building up on the idea, one can use phonetic [[Input method editor|IME]] tools that allow [[Indic scripts|Indic]] text to be input in any application.

Some examples of phonetic transliterators are Xlit, [[Google Indic Transliteration]], [[BarahaIME]], [[Indic IME]], [[Rupantar]], SMC's Indic Keyboard and [[Microsoft Indic Language Input Tool]]. [[Swathanthra Malayalam Computing|SMC]]'s Indic Keyboard has support for as many as 23 languages whereas Google Indic Keyboard only supports 11 Indian languages.&lt;ref name="NIE"/&gt;

They can be broadly classified as:
* Fixed transliteration scheme based tools - They work using a fixed transliteration scheme to convert text. Some examples are [[Indic IME]], [[Rupantar]] and [[BarahaIME]].
* Intelligent/Learning based transliteration tools - They compare the word with a dictionary and then convert it to the equivalent words in the target language. Some of the popular ones are [[Google Indic Transliteration]], [[Xlit]], [[Microsoft Indic Language Input Tool]] and [[QuillPad]].

====Remington (typewriter)====
This layout was developed when computers had not been invented or deployed with Indic languages, and typewriters were the only means to type text in Indic scripts. Since typewriters were mechanical and could not include a script processor engine, each character had to be placed on the keyboard separately, which resulted in a very complex and difficult to learn keyboard layout.

With the advent of [[Unicode]], the Remington layout was added to various typing tools for sake of backward compatibility, so that old typists did not have to learn a new keyboard layout. Nowadays this layout is only used by old typists who are used to this layout due to several years of usage. One tool to include Remington layout is [[Indic IME]]. A font that is based on the Remington keyboard layout is [[Kruti Dev]]. Another online tool that very closely supports the old Remington keyboard layout using Kruti Dev is the Remington Typing tool.

==Braille==
{{Main|Bharati Braille}}
IBus Sharada Braille, which supports seven Indian languages was developed by [[Swathanthra Malayalam Computing|SMC]].&lt;ref name="NIE"/&gt;

===Mobile phones with Numeric keyboards===
[[File:Nokia1108HindiKeypad.jpg|right|thumb|100px|Nokia 1108 Hindi]]
Mobile/Hand/cell phone basic models have 12 keys like the plain old telephone keypad. Each key is mapped to 3 or 4 English letters to facilitate data entry in English. For inputting Indian languages with this kind of keypad, there are two ways to do so. First is the Multi-tap Method and second uses visual help from the screen like Panini Keypad.  The primary usage is [[SMS]]. 140 characters size used for English/Roman languages can be used to accommodate only about 70 language characters when Unicode&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://quillpadmobile.in/faq.html|title=Quillpad Mobile - FAQs|publisher=|accessdate=28 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Proprietary compression is used some times to increase the size of single message for Complex script languages like Hindi. A research study&lt;ref&gt;[http://bwci.org.in/demo/upload_files/file/bwci_files/activities/sigils/SIGILS_Report_Ver1c-with%20cover.pdf SIG Report on Indian Language SMS, Nov 2010]&lt;/ref&gt; of the available methods and recommendations of proposed standard was released by  Broadband Wireless Consortium of India (BWCI).

====Transliteration/Phonetic methods====
English is used to type in Indian languages.
[[QuillPad]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://quillpadmobile.in/index.html|title=Quillpad Mobile - Hindi SMS application for your mobile phone|publisher=|accessdate=28 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
IndiSMS&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eternoinfotech.com/IndiSMS.html|title=Eterno Infotech|publisher=|accessdate=28 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Native methods====
In native methods, the letters of the language are displayed on the screen corresponding to the numeral keys based on the probabilities of those letters for that language. Additional letters can be accessed by using a special key. When a word is partially typed, options are presented from which the user can make a selection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.paninikeypad.com/index.php|title=Keypad for mobile-Keyboard for mobile-Keyboard for typing on mobile-Keypad for typing on mobile|publisher=|accessdate=28 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Smart phones with Qwerty keyboards===
Most smart phones have about 35 keys catering primarily to English language. Numerals and some symbols are accessed with a special key called Alt. Indic input methods are yet to  evolve for these types of phones, as support of [[Unicode]] for rendering is  not widely available.

===For Smart Phones with Soft/Virtual keyboards===
Inscript is being adopted for smart phone usage.  For Android phones which can render Indic languages, Swalekh Multilingual Keypad&lt;ref&gt;[http://gadgets.ndtv.com/apps/features/this-bengaluru-based-startup-believes-it-has-built-a-smarter-indic-keyboard-1674841   This Bengaluru-Based Startup Believes It Has Built a Smarter Indic Keyboard  - NDTV]&lt;/ref&gt; Multiling Keyboard app&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://market.android.com/details?id=com.klye.ime.latin&amp;hl=en|title=MultiLing Keyboard - Android Apps on Google Play|author=Honso|publisher=|accessdate=28 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://market.android.com/details?id=klye.plugin.hi&amp;feature=search_result#?t=W251bGwsMSwxLDEsImtseWUucGx1Z2luLmhpIl0.|title=Plugin Hindi हिन्दी - Android Apps on Google Play|author=Honso|publisher=|accessdate=28 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; are available. [[Gboard]] offers support for several Indian languages.&lt;ref name="livemint"/&gt;

==Localization==
{{main|Internationalization and localization}}
Localization means translating software, operating systems, websites etc. various applications in Indian language. Various volunteers groups are working in this direction.
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:GoI App Multilingual.jpg|200px|right|text=[[UMANG]] app showing multiple languages]] --&gt;

===Mandrake Tamil Version===
A notable example is the Tamil version of Mandrake linux. Tamil speakers in [[Toronto]] (Canada) released [[Mandriva Linux|Mandrake]], a GNU/Linux software, in coming out with a Tamil version.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://infochangeindia.org/technology/features/indian-language-computing-the-long-road-ahead.html|title=Indian-language computing: The long road ahead - Features - Technology|author=Frederick Noronha|publisher=|accessdate=28 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can be noted that all the features can be accessed in Tamil. By this, the prerequisite of English knowledge for using computers has been eliminated, for those who know Tamil.

===IndLinux===
IndLinux is a volunteer group aiming to translate the [[Linux]] [[operating system]] into Indian languages. By the efforts of this group, Linux has been localized almost completely in Hindi and other Indian languages.

===Nipun===
Nipun is an online translation system aimed to translate various application in [[Hindi]]. It is part of ''Akshargram Network''.

===Localising Websites===
[[GoDaddy]] has localised its website in [[Hindi]], [[Marathi language|Marathi]] and [[Tamil language|Tamil]] and also noted that 40% of the call volume for IVR is in Indian Languages.&lt;ref name="EcoTimes"/&gt;

==Indic blogging==
Indic blogging refers to blogging in Indic languages. Various efforts have been done to promote blogging in Indian languages.

==Social Networks==
Some Social networks are started in Indian languages.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.livemint.com/Industry/uH1cxQy4c5TgyV2oXzkdgO/Google-and-Facebooks-attention-to-India-might-speed-up-Indi.html  Google and Facebook’s attention to India might speed up Indic computing - Live Mint]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Indic programming languages==

==Software==

===Spell Checkers===

===Transliteration tools===
Transliteration tools allows users to read a text in different script. As of now, [[Aksharamukha]] is the tool which allows most Indian scripts. Google also offers [[Google Indic Transliteration|Indic Transliteration]]. Text from any of these scripts can be converted to any other scripts and vice versa. Whereas Google and Microsoft allow transliteration from Latin letters to Indic scripts.

===Text-to-Speech===
[[Carnegie Mellon University]], in collaboration with the Hear2Read project, has developed a text-to-speech (TTS) software that helps the visually impaired listen to text in native Indian languages. Currently, [[Tamil language|Tamil]] is being offered and ,  releases in Hindi, Bengali, Gujarati, Marathi, Kannada, Punjabi and Telugu are expected over the remainder of 2016.&lt;ref name="University 2016"&gt;{{cite web | last=University | first=Carnegie Mellon | title=Android App Lets Visually Impaired in India Listen to Texts in Native Languages-CMU News | website=Carnegie Mellon University | date=2016-08-03 | url=http://www.cmu.edu/news/stories/archives/2016/august/hear2read.html | accessdate=2016-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Early records===
One of the earliest accounts of Islam's possible presence in North America dates to 1528, when a Moroccan slave, called [[Estevanico]], was shipwrecked near present-day Galveston, Texas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Manseau|first1=Peter|title=The Muslims of Early America|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/09/opinion/the-founding-muslims.html?smid=fb-nytimes&amp;smtyp=cur&amp;bicmp=AD&amp;bicmlukp=WT.mc_id&amp;bicmst=1409232722000&amp;bicmet=1419773522000&amp;_r=0|work=The New York Times|accessdate=February 12, 2015|date=February 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He and four survivors subsequently traveled through much of the American southwest and the Mexican interior before reaching Mexico City.

"Muslims' presence [in the United States] is affirmed in documents dated more than a century before religious liberty became the law of the land, as in a Virginia statute of 1682 which referred to 'negroes, moores, molatoes, and others, born of and in heathenish, idollatrous, pagan, and Mahometan parentage and country' who 'heretofore and hereafter may be purchased, procured, or otherwise obteigned, as slaves.{{'"}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Manseau|first1=Peter|title=What Happened to America's First Muslims?|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/peter-manseau/what-happened-to-americas-first-muslims_b_6809326.html?ncid=txtlnkusaolp00000592|work=The Huffington Post|date=March 9, 2015|accessdate=March 11, 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150311005810/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/peter-manseau/what-happened-to-americas-first-muslims_b_6809326.html?ncid=txtlnkusaolp00000592|archivedate=March 11, 2015|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1785 and 1815, over a hundred American sailors were held for ransom in Algiers.  Several wrote captivity narratives of their experiences that gave most Americans their first view of the Arab World and Muslim ways, and newspapers often commented on them.  The views were generally negative.  [[Royall Tyler]] wrote ''The Algerine Captive'' (1797), an early American novel depicting the life of an American doctor employed in the slave trade who himself is captured and enslaved by Barbary pirates.  Finally Presidents Jefferson and Madison sent the American navy to confront the pirates, and ended the threat in 1815 during the [[First Barbary War]].&lt;ref&gt;Robert Battistini, "Glimpses of the Other before Orientalism: The Muslim World in Early American Periodicals, 1785–1800," ''Early American Studies'' Spring 2010, Vol. 8#2 pp. 446–74&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Savages of the Seas: Barbary Captivity Tales and Images of Muslims in the Early Republic," ''Journal of American Culture'' Summer 1990, Vol. 13#2 pp. 75–84&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Frank Lambert, ''The Barbary Wars: American Independence in the Atlantic World'' (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;  During negotiation of the treaty of peace which ended hostilities, American envoys made clear that the United States had no animosity towards any Muslim country.

During the American Civil war, the "[[scorched earth]]" policy of the North destroyed churches, farms, schools, libraries, colleges, and a great deal of other property. The libraries at the University of Alabama managed to save one book from the debris of their library buildings. On the morning of April 4, 1865, when Federal troops reached the campus with an order to destroy the university, Andre Deloffre, a modern language professor and custodian of the library, appealed to the commanding officer to spare one of the finest libraries in the South. The officer, being sympathetic, sent a courier to Gen. Croxton at his headquarters in Tuscaloosa asking permission to save the Rotunda, but the general refused to allow this. The officer reportedly said, "I will save one volume as a memento of this occasion." The volume selected was a rare copy of the Qur'an.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Ishaq Zahid |url=http://www.islam101.com/history/muslim_us_hist.html |title=American Muslim History |publisher=Islam101.com |accessdate=December 6, 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111209004304/http://www.islam101.com/history/muslim_us_hist.html |archivedate=December 9, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Slaves===
[[File:Ibn Sori.jpg|upright|thumb|left|Drawing of [[Abdulrahman Ibrahim Ibn Sori]], who was a Muslim prince from [[West Africa]] and made a slave in the United States.]]
Many enslaved peoples brought to America from Africa were Muslims from the predominantly Muslim West African region&lt;ref name="diouf"&gt;Sylviane A. Diouf, ''Servants of Allah: African Muslims Enslaved in the Americas'' (1998)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="curtis"&gt;Edward E.

Behrendt, David Richardson, and David Eltis, [[W. E. B. Du Bois Institute|W. E. B. Du Bois Institute for African and African-American Research]], [[Harvard University]].

It is estimated that over 50% of the slaves imported to North America came from areas where Islam was followed by at least a minority population. Thus, no less than 200,000 came from regions influenced by Islam. Substantial numbers originated from [[Senegambia Confederation|Senegambia]], a region with an established community of [[Islam in Senegal|Muslim inhabitants]] extending to the 11th century.&lt;ref name = Koszegi&gt;{{cite book

Through a series of conflicts, primarily with the [[Fula people|Fulani]] [[Fulani jihad states|jihad states]], about half of the Senegambian [[Mandinka people|Mandinka]] were converted to Islam, while as many as a third were sold into slavery to the Americas through capture in conflict.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://muse.jhu.edu/demo/history_in_africa/v032/32.1schaffer.pdf |title=Bound To Africa – The Mandinka Legacy In The New World |format=PDF |accessdate=November 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Michael A. Gomez speculated that Muslim slaves may have accounted for "thousands, if not tens of thousands", but does not offer a precise estimate. He also suggests many non-Muslim slaves were acquainted with some tenets of Islam, due to Muslim trading and proselytizing activities.&lt;ref name = Gomez&gt;{{cite journal

Some newly arrived Muslim slaves assembled for communal [[salat]] (prayers). Some were provided a private praying area by their owner. The two best documented Muslim slaves were [[Ayuba Suleiman Diallo]] and [[Omar Ibn Said]]. Suleiman was brought to America in 1731 and returned to Africa in 1734.&lt;ref name = Koszegi/&gt; Like many Muslim slaves, he often encountered impediments when attempting to perform religious rituals and was eventually allotted a private location for prayer by his master.&lt;ref name = Gomez1/&gt;

Omar Ibn Said (c. 1770–1864) is among the best documented examples of a practicing-Muslim slave. He lived on a 19th Century North Carolina plantation and wrote many Arabic texts while enslaved. Born in the kingdom of [[Futa Tooro]] (modern [[Senegal]]), he arrived in America in 1807, one month before [[Act Prohibiting Importation of Slaves|the U.S. abolished importation of slaves]]. Some of his works include the Lords Prayer, the Bismillah, this is How You Pray, Quranic phases, the 23rd Psalm, and an autobiography. In 1857, he produced his last known writing on Surah 110 of the Quran. In 1819, Omar received an Arabic translation of the Christian Bible from his master, James Owen. Omar converted to Christianity in 1820, an episode widely used throughout the South to "prove" the benevolence of slavery. However, most scholars believe he continued to be a practicing Muslim, based on dedications to Muhammad written in his Bible.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas C. Parramore,  "Muslim Slave Aristocrats in North Carolina," ''North Carolina Historical Review,'' April 2000, Vol. 77 Issue 2, pp. 127–50&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;In 1991, a masjid in [[Fayetteville, North Carolina]] renamed itself Masjid Omar Ibn Said in his honor.

===Religious freedom===
Views of Islam in America affected debates regarding freedom of religion during the drafting of the state constitution of [[Pennsylvania]] in 1776. Constitutionalists promoted religious toleration while Anticonstitutionalists called for reliance on Protestant values in the formation of the state's republican government. The former group won out, and inserted a clause for religious liberty in the new state constitution.  American views of Islam were influenced by favorable [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] writings from Europe, as well as Europeans who had long warned that Islam was a threat to Christianity and republicanism.&lt;ref&gt;Charles D. Russell, "Islam as a Danger to Republican Virtue: Broadening Religious Liberty in Revolutionary Pennsylvania", ''Pennsylvania History'', Summer 2009, Vol. 76 Issue 3, pp. 250–275&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1776, [[John Adams]] published "[[Thoughts on Government]]", in which he mentions the Islamic prophet Muhammad as a "sober inquirer after truth" alongside Confucius, Zoroaster, Socrates, and other thinkers.

In 1785, [[George Washington]] stated a willingness to hire "Mahometans", as well as people of any nation or religion, to work on his private estate at Mount Vernon if they were "good workmen".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hutson |first=James H. |url=https://www.loc.gov/loc/lcib/0205/tolerance.html |title=The Founding Fathers and Islam |work=Library of Congress Information Bulletin |date= May 2002 |publisher=[[Library of Congress]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050427225400/http://www.loc.gov/loc/lcib/0205/tolerance.html |archivedate=April 27, 2005 |accessdate=December 16, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1790, the South Carolina legislative body granted [[Moors Sundry Act of 1790|special legal status]] to a community of Moroccans.

In 1797, President John Adams signed the [[Treaty of Tripoli]], declaring the United States had no "character of enmity against the laws, religion, or tranquillity, of [[Muslim|Mussulmen]]".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/diplomacy/barbary/bar1796t.htm Treaty of Peace and Friendship] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070916113305/http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/diplomacy/barbary/bar1796t.htm |date=September 16, 2007 }} Article 11.

In his [[The Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin|autobiography]], published in 1791, [[Benjamin Franklin]] stated that he "did not disapprove" of a meeting place in Pennsylvania that was designed to accommodate preachers of all religions. Franklin wrote that "even if the Mufti of Constantinople were to send a missionary to preach Mohammedanism to us, he would find a pulpit at his service".&lt;ref name="Earlyamerica.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.earlyamerica.com/lives/franklin/chapt10/ |title=The Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin – Chapter 10 |publisher=Earlyamerica.com |date=February 27, 2007 |accessdate=December 6, 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111201185040/http://www.earlyamerica.com/lives/franklin/chapt10/ |archivedate=December 1, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Franklin also wrote an anti-slavery parody that claimed to be translation of the response of a government official at Algiers to a 17th-century petition to banish slavery there; the parody develops the theme that Europeans are specially suited for enslavement on cultural and religious grounds, and that there would be practical problems with abolishing slavery in North Africa; this satirizes similar arguments that were then made about the enslavement of Blacks in North America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sniggle.net/historicus.php |title=Sniggle.net |publisher=Sniggle.net |accessdate=December 6, 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111203200932/http://sniggle.net/historicus.php |archivedate=December 3, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Thomas Jefferson]] defended religious freedom in America including those of Muslims. Jefferson explicitly mentioned Muslims when writing about the movement for religious freedom in [[Virginia]]. In his autobiography Jefferson wrote "[When] the [Virginia] bill for establishing religious freedom&amp;nbsp;... was finally passed,&amp;nbsp;... a singular proposition proved that its protection of opinion was meant to be universal. Where the preamble declares that coercion is a departure from the plan of the holy author of our religion, an amendment was proposed, by inserting the word 'Jesus Christ', so that it should read 'a departure from the plan of Jesus Christ, the holy author of our religion'. The insertion was rejected by a great majority, in proof that they meant to comprehend within the mantle of its protection the Jew and the Gentile, the Christian and [[Mahometan]], the Hindoo and infidel of every denomination."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://etext.virginia.edu/jefferson/quotations/jeff1650.htm |title=Thomas Jefferson – Subject Research Guides at UVa Library |publisher=Etext.virginia.edu |date=April 21, 2011 |accessdate=December 6, 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101205032639/http://etext.virginia.edu/jefferson/quotations/jeff1650.htm |archivedate=December 5, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; While President, Jefferson also participated in an [[iftar]] with the Ambassador of [[Tunisia]] in 1809.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.state.gov/secretary/rm/2009a/09/129232.htm |title=Remarks at the Annual State Department Iftaar Dinner |publisher=State.gov |date=September 15, 2009 |accessdate=December 6, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111202015142/http://www.state.gov/secretary/rm/2009a/09/129232.htm |archivedate=December 2, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, not all politicians were pleased with the religious neutrality of the Constitution, which prohibited any religious test. Anti-Federalists in the 1788 North Carolina ratifying convention opposed the new constitution; one reason was the fear that some day Catholics or Muslims might be elected president. William Lancaster said:.&lt;ref&gt;Denise A. Spellberg, "Could a Muslim Be President? An Eighteenth-Century Constitutional Debate, ''Eighteenth-Century Studies'' 39#4 (2006) pp. 485–506&lt;/ref&gt;
:Let us remember that we form a government for millions not yet in existence&amp;nbsp;... In the course of four or five hundred years, I do not know how it will work. This is most certain, that Papists may occupy that chair, and Mahometans may take it. I see nothing against it.

In 1788, Americans held inaccurate and often contradicting views of the [[Muslim world]], and used that in political arguments. For example, the anti-Federalists compared a strong central government to the Sultan of the Ottoman Empire and the American army to Turkish Janissaries, arguing against a strong central government. On the other hand, [[Alexander Hamilton]] argued that despotism in the Middle East was the result of the Sultan not having enough power to protect his people from oppressive local governors; thus he argued for a stronger central government.&lt;ref&gt;Robert J. Allison, ''The Crescent Obscured: The United States and the Muslim World, 1776–1815'' (1995) pp. 57–59&lt;/ref&gt;

Small-scale migration to the U.S. by Muslims began in 1840, with the arrival of [[Yemeni-American|Yemenis]] and [[Turkish-Americans|Turks]],&lt;ref name = Koszegi/&gt; and lasted until [[World War I]]. Most of the immigrants, from Arab areas of the [[Ottoman Empire]], came with the purpose of making money and returning to their homeland. However, the economic hardships of 19th-century America prevented them from prospering, and as a result the immigrants settled in the United States permanently. These immigrants settled primarily in [[Dearborn, Michigan]]; [[Quincy, Massachusetts]]; and [[Ross, North Dakota|Ross]], [[North Dakota]]. Ross, North Dakota is the site of the first documented mosque and Muslim Cemetery, but it was abandoned and later torn down in the mid-1970s. A new mosque was built in its place in 2005.&lt;ref name = M/&gt;

This is the longest lasting incorporated Muslim community in the United States. They met in Bosnian coffeehouses and eventually opened the first Islamic Sunday School with curriculum and textbooks under Bosnian scholar Sheikh Ćamil Avdić (Kamil Avdich) (a graduate of al-Azhar and author of ''Survey of Islamic Doctrines'').

During the first half of the 20th century, a small number of African Americans established groups based on Islamic and Gnostic teachings. The first of such groups created was the [[Moorish Science Temple of America]], founded by Timothy Drew (Drew Ali) in 1913. Drew taught that black people were of Moorish origin but their Muslim identity was taken away through slavery and racial segregation, advocating the return to Islam of their Moorish ancestry.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/391620/Moorish-Science-Temple-of-America Moorish Science Temple of America] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080516121323/http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/391620/Moorish-Science-Temple-of-America |date=May 16, 2008 }} Britannica Online Encyclopedia.

====Moorish Science Temple of America====
{{Main|Moorish Science Temple of America}}
The Moorish Science Temple of America is an American organization founded in 1913 by Prophet Noble Drew Ali. He said they practiced the "Old Time Religion" of Islamism but he also drew inspiration from Mohammedanism, Buddhism, Christianity, [[Gnosticism]], and [[Taoism]]. Its significant divergences from mainstream Islam and strong African-American ethnic character&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chicagoreader.com/chicago/the-aging-of-the-moors/Content?oid=999633|title=The Aging of the Moors|work=Chicago Reader|accessdate=February 15, 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150223130455/http://www.chicagoreader.com/chicago/the-aging-of-the-moors/Content?oid=999633|archivedate=February 23, 2015|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; make its classification as an Islamic denomination a matter of debate among Muslims and scholars of religion.

Its primary tenet was the belief that they are the ancient [[Moab]]ites who inhabited the Northwestern and Southwestern shores of Africa. The organization also believes that their descendants after being conquered in Spain are slaves who were captured and held in slavery from 1779–1865 by their slaveholders.

Adherents of the Moorish Science Temple of America believe that the so-called "[[Negroid]] Asiatic" was the first human inhabitant of the Western Hemisphere. In their religious texts members refer to themselves as "Asiatics",&lt;ref&gt;The Holy Koran of the Moorish Science Temple of America Chapter XXV – "A Holy Covenant of the Asiatic Nation"&lt;/ref&gt; within the teachings of Noble Drew Ali, the members are taught man cannot be a Negro, Colored Folk, Black people, Ethiopians or African-Americans, because these names were given to slaves by slave holders in 1779 and lasted until 1865 during the time of slavery.

The Moorish Science Temple of America is legally and lawfully recognized as the first and oldest Islamic Organization in America, with its current leader R. Jones-Bey.

{{Main|Nation of Islam}}
The [[Nation of Islam]] (NOI) was created in 1930 by [[Wallace Fard Muhammad]]. Fard drew inspiration for NOI doctrines from those of Timothy Drew's Moorish Science Temple of America. He provided three main principles which serve as the foundation of the NOI: "Allah is God, the white man is the devil and the so-called Negroes are the Asiatic Black People, the cream of the planet earth".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/10778634|title=From black Muslims to Muslims : the transition from separatism to Islam, 1930-1980|last=1946-|first=Marsh, Clifton E.,|date=1984|publisher=Scarecrow Press|isbn=9780810817050|location=Metuchen, N.J.|oclc=10778634}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1934 [[Elijah Muhammad]] became the leader of the NOI, he [[Apotheosis|deified]] Fard, saying that he was an [[incarnation]] of God, and taught that he was a prophet who had been taught directly by God in the form of  Fard. Two of the most famous people to join the NOI were [[Malcolm X]], who became the face of the NOI in the media, and [[Muhammad Ali]], who, while initially rejected, was accepted into the group shortly after his first world heavyweight championship victory.&lt;ref name=JN&gt;Jacob Neusner (2003). pp. 180–81. {{ISBN|978-0-664-22475-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Both Malcolm X and Ali later became Sunni Muslims.

Malcolm X was one of the most influential leaders of the NOI and, in accordance with NOI doctrine, advocated the complete [[Black separatism|separation of blacks from whites]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Lomax |first=Louis E. |authorlink=Louis Lomax |title=When the Word Is Given: A Report on Elijah Muhammad, Malcolm X, and the Black Muslim World |year=1963 |publisher=World Publishing |location=Cleveland |oclc=1071204 |pages=149–52 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He left the NOI after being silenced for 90 days (due to a [[Malcolm X#NOI response to his remarks on Kennedy assassination|controversial comment]] on the [[John F.

The [[Islamic Supreme Council of America]] (ISCA) is a small body representing [[Sufi]] teachings, which, according to adherents, is the inner, mystical dimension of Islam. The ISCA's stated aims include providing practical solutions for American Muslims, based on the traditional Islamic legal rulings of an international advisory board, many of whom are recognized as the highest ranking Islamic scholars in the world.

[[Non-denominational Muslim]]s make up roughly one in seven of all American Muslims, at 15%. Non-denominational Muslims, do not have any specific affiliation with a religious body and usually describe themselves as being "just a Muslim". Muslims who were born in the US are more likely to be non-denominational than immigrant Muslims. 24% or one in four US-born Muslims are non-denominational, versus 10% of immigrant Muslims.&lt;ref&gt;Section 2: Religious Beliefs and Practices, Pew Research Center&lt;/ref&gt;

The U.S. Census Bureau does not collect data on religious identification. Various institutions and organizations have given widely varying estimates about how many Muslims live in the U.S. Tom W. Smith, author of "Estimating the Muslim Population in the United States", said that of twenty estimates he reviewed during a five-year period until 2001, none was "based on a scientifically-sound or explicit methodology. All can probably be characterized as guesses or assertions. Nine came from Muslim organizations such as the Islamic Society of North America, the Muslim Student Association, the Council on American-Islamic Relations, the American Muslim Council, and the Harvard Islamic Society or unspecified 'Muslim sources'.

According to a Pew Forum estimate, in 2017 there were 3.45 million Muslims, constituting about 1.1% of the total U.S. population.&lt;ref name=Pew2017/&gt; A Pew Forum report on American religion found that Muslims accounted for 0.9% of American adults in 2014, up from 0.4% in 2007, due largely to immigration. Retention rates were high, at 77%, similar to Hindus (80%) and Jews (75%); most people who leave these religions become unaffiliated, although ex-Muslims were more likely to be Christians than ex-Hindus or ex-Jews were. Conversely, 23% of American Muslims were converts, including 8% from historically black Protestant traditions, 6% from being unaffiliated, 4% from Catholicism, and 3% from mainline or evangelical Protestantism. By race, in 2014, 38% were non-Hispanic white (including Arabs and Iranians, up from 32% in 2007), 28% were Asian (mostly Indians, Pakistanis, and Bangladeshis, up from 20% in 2007), 28% were black (down from 32%), 4% Hispanic (down from 7%), and 3% of mixed or other race (down from 7%). Since 2007, the black proportion had shrunk, while the white and Asian proportions had grown, mainly due to immigration as most black Muslims were native U.S. blacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pewforum.org/2015/05/12/americas-changing-religious-landscape/ |title=America’s Changing Religious Landscape |date=May 12, 2015 |publisher=Pew Research |accessdate=May 15, 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160623114225/http://www.pewforum.org/2015/05/12/americas-changing-religious-landscape/ |archivedate=June 23, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2018, the [[Pew Research Center]] projected that by 2040, Muslims will replace [[American Jews|Jews]] as the second-largest religious group in the U.S. (after [[Christianity in the United States|Christians]]). By 2050, the number of American Muslims was projected to be twice the size of the 2017 Muslim population. Pew cited high fertility rates among American Muslims and immigration of Muslims to the U.S. as the reasons for the growth. It said that religious conversion was not expected to be a significant factor, because the number of American converts to Islam is roughly the same as the number of people who leave the religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2018/01/03/new-estimates-show-u-s-muslim-population-continues-to-grow/ |title=New estimates show U.S. Muslim population continues to grow |first=Besheer |last=Mohamed |date=January 3, 2018 |publisher=[[Pew Research Center]] |accessdate=January 6, 2018 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180105211330/http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2018/01/03/new-estimates-show-u-s-muslim-population-continues-to-grow/ |archivedate=January 5, 2018 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The household income levels of American Muslims are about as evenly distributed as the general American population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/10/11/how-income-varies-among-u-s-religious-groups/|title=How income varies among U.S. religious groups|author=|date=October 11, 2016|website=pewresearch.org|accessdate=April 28, 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180221015534/http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/10/11/how-income-varies-among-u-s-religious-groups/|archivedate=February 21, 2018|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When it comes to education, the Institute for Social Policy and Understanding reported in 2017 that across the board, American Muslims, Protestants, and Catholics have similar education levels. It has also been found that Muslim women (73%) are more likely than Muslim men (57%) to go on to pursue higher education beyond high school, and they are also more likely to report being in the middle class.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ispu.org/american-muslim-poll-2017-key-findings/|title=American Muslim Poll 2017: Key Findings {{!}} ISPU|date=2017-03-21|work=Institute for Social Policy and Understanding|access-date=2018-06-14|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

45 percent of immigrant Muslims report annual household income levels of $50,000 or higher. This compares to the national average of 44 percent. Immigrant Muslims are well represented among higher-income earners, with 19 percent having annual household incomes of $100,000 or higher (compared to 16 percent for the Muslim population as a whole and 17 percent for the U.S. average). This is likely due to the strong concentration of Muslims in professional, managerial, and technical fields, especially in information technology, education, medicine, law, and the corporate world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.america.gov/st/peopleplace-english/2008/December/20081222090246jmnamdeirf0.4547083.html |title=Muslims in America – A Statistical Portrait |publisher=America.gov |accessdate=December 6, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111014023151/http://www.america.gov/st/peopleplace-english/2008/December/20081222090246jmnamdeirf0.4547083.html |archivedate=October 14, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Conversion to Islam in prisons===
{{main|Conversion to Islam in U.S. prisons}}
In addition to immigration, the state, federal and local prisons of the United States may be a contributor to the growth of Islam in the country. According to J. Michael Waller, Muslim inmates constitute 15–20% of the prison population, or roughly 350,000 inmates in 2003. Waller states that these inmates mostly come into prison as non-Muslims. He also says that 80% of the prisoners who "find faith" while in prison convert to Islam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://judiciary.senate.gov/hearings/testimony.cfm?id=4f1e0899533f7680e78d03281ff19bc6&amp;wit_id=4f1e0899533f7680e78d03281ff19bc6-2-1 |title=Statement of J.

Within the Muslim community in the United States there exist a number of different traditions. As in the rest of the world, the Sunni Muslims are in the majority. Shia Muslims, especially those in the Iranian immigrant community, are also active in community affairs. All four major schools of Islamic jurisprudence ([[fiqh]]) are found among the Sunni community.

Some Muslims in the U.S. are also adherents of certain global movements within Islam such as the [[Salafism|Salafi]], the [[Muslim Brotherhood]], the [[Gülen Movement#The Gülen movement|Gülen movement]], and the [[Tablighi Jamaat]].

Unlike many Muslims in Europe, American Muslims overall do not tend to feel marginalized or isolated from political participation and have often adopted a politically proactive stance. Several organizations were formed by the American Muslim community to serve as "critical consultants" on U.S. policy regarding Iraq and Afghanistan. Other groups have worked with law enforcement agencies to point out Muslims within the United States that they suspect of fostering "intolerant attitudes".

==Organizations==

One of the largest Islamic organizations is the [[Islamic Society of North America]] (ISNA) which says that 27% of mosques in U.S. are associated with it. ISNA is an association of immigrant Muslim organizations and individuals that provides a common platform for presenting Islam. It is composed mostly of immigrants. Its membership may have recently exceeded ASM, as many independent mosques throughout the United States are choosing to affiliate with it. ISNA's annual convention is the largest gathering of Muslims in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.isna.net Islamic Society of North America Official Website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041017011936/http://isna.net/ |date=October 17, 2004 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The second largest is the community under the leadership of W.Deen Mohammed or the [[American Society of Muslims]] with 19% of mosques, mostly African-Americans having an affiliation with it. It was the successor organization to the [[Nation of Islam]], once better-known as the Black Muslims. The association recognizes the leadership of [[Warith Deen Mohammed]]. This group evolved from the [[black separatism|Black separatist]] [[Nation of Islam]] (1930–1975). The majority of its members are African Americans. This has been a 23-year process of religious reorientation and organizational decentralization, in the course of which the group was known by other names, such as the [[American Muslim Mission]], W.Deen Mohammed guided its members to the practice of mainstream Islam such as salat or fasting, and teaching the basic creed of Islam the ''[[shahadah]]''.

The third largest group is the [[Islamic Circle of North America]] (ICNA). ICNA describes itself as a non-ethnic, open to all, independent, [[North America]]-wide, grass-roots organization. It is composed mostly of immigrants and the children of immigrants. It is growing as various independent mosques throughout the United States join and also may be larger than ASM at the present moment. Its youth division is [[Young Muslims]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.icna.org/ |title=Islamic Circle of North America Official Website |publisher=Icna.org |accessdate=December 6, 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111204161946/http://www.icna.org/ |archivedate=December 4, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Why Islam?]] is a community outreach project of ICNA;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.euro-islam.info/country-profiles/united-states/|title=Islam in the United States|publisher=|accessdate=March 5, 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150313100411/http://www.euro-islam.info/country-profiles/united-states|archivedate=March 13, 2015|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Message"&gt;Sherri Day, [http://www.tampabay.com/news/religion/muslims-take-message-on-the-road/937236 "Muslims take message on the road"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140812211331/http://www.tampabay.com/news/religion/muslims-take-message-on-the-road/937236 |date=August 12, 2014 }}, ''Tampa Bay Times'', December 13, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; it seeks to provide accurate information about Islam&lt;ref&gt;Star-Ledger Editorial Board, [http://blog.nj.com/njv_editorial_page/2011/08/why_islam_fights_misunderstand.html "Why Islam? fights misunderstanding with the facts"] {{webarchive|url=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20140618134725/http://blog.nj.com/njv_editorial_page/2011/08/why_islam_fights_misunderstand.html |date=June 18, 2014 }}, ''The Star-Ledger'', August 10, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; while debunking popular stereotypes and common misconceptions through various services and outreach activities.&lt;ref name="Billboard Blitz"&gt;Liane Membis, [http://religion.blogs.cnn.com/2011/08/15/billboard-blitz-for-877-why-islam/ "Billboard Blitz for 877-Why-Islam info hotline"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140711000101/http://religion.blogs.cnn.com/2011/08/15/billboard-blitz-for-877-why-islam/ |date=July 11, 2014 }}, ''CNN'', August 15, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alice Speri, [http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2011/08/nj_turnpike_muslim_billboard.html "In time for Ramadan, toll-free hotline seeks to educate N.J. residents about Islam"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140812214530/http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2011/08/nj_turnpike_muslim_billboard.html |date=August 12, 2014 }}, ''The Star-Ledger'', August 8, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2007 survey titled ''Muslim Americans: Middle Class and Mostly Mainstream'', the [[Pew Research Center]] found Muslim Americans to be "largely integrated, happy with their lives, and moderate with respect to many of the issues that have divided Muslims and Westerners around the world."&lt;ref name="PewMainstream"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pewresearch.org/assets/pdf/muslim-americans.pdf |title=''Muslim Americans: Middle Class and Mostly Mainstream'' |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120916051122/http://pewresearch.org/assets/pdf/muslim-americans.pdf |archivedate=September 16, 2012 |df= }}&amp;nbsp;{{small|(656&amp;nbsp;KB)}}, Pew Research Center, May 22, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

47% of respondents said they considered themselves Muslims first and Americans second.  However, this was compared to 81% of British Muslims and 69% of German Muslims, when asked the equivalent question.  A similar disparity exists in income, the percentage of American Muslims living in poverty is 2% higher than the general population, compared to an 18% disparity for French Muslims and 29% difference for Spanish Muslims.&lt;ref name="PewMainstream"/&gt;

Politically, American Muslims both supported larger government and are socially conservative.   Despite their social conservatism, 71% of American Muslims expressed a preference for the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]].&lt;ref name="PewMainstream"/&gt; The Pew Research survey also showed that nearly three quarters of respondents believed that American society rewards them for hard work regardless of their religious background.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Major poll finds U.S. Muslims Mostly Mainstream | date=June 1, 2007 | publisher=Voice of America | url=http://voanews.com/english/archive/2007-06/2007-06-01-voa36.cfm | work=VOA News | pages= | accessdate=December 25, 2008 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081211132319/http://voanews.com/english/archive/2007-06/2007-06-01-voa36.cfm | archivedate=December 11, 2008 | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The same poll also reported that 40% of U.S. Muslims believe that Arab Muslims carried out the 9/11 attacks. Another 28% do not believe it and 32% said they had no opinion. Among the 28% who doubted that Arab Muslims were behind the conspiracy, one-fourth said the U.S. government or President [[George W. Bush]] was responsible. 26% of American Muslims believe the U.S.-led "war on terror" is a sincere effort to root out international terrorism. 5% of those surveyed had a "very favorable" or "somewhat favorable" view of Al-Qaeda. 35% of American Muslims stated that the decision for military action in Afghanistan was the right one and 12% supported the use of military force in Iraq.&lt;ref name="PewMainstream"/&gt;

Although American Muslims do report feeling discriminated against as a religious minority, they are just as likely as the general public (81%) to say they value their American Identity. In fact, a 2018 study done by the Institute for Social Policy and Understanding asserts that, “a higher religious identity correlates with a higher American identity among all Americans, especially Muslims.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ispu.org/american-muslim-poll-2018-full-report/|title=American Muslim Poll 2018: Full Report {{!}} ISPU|date=2018-04-30|work=Institute for Social Policy and Understanding|access-date=2018-06-14|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2007 survey, 53% of American Muslims reported that it was more difficult to be a Muslim after the 9/11 attacks. Asked to name the most important problem facing them, the options named by more than ten percent of American Muslims were discrimination (19%), being viewed as a terrorist (15%), public's ignorance about Islam (13%), and stereotyping (12%). 54% believe that the U.S. government's anti-terrorism activities single out Muslims. 76% of surveyed Muslim Americans stated that they are very or somewhat concerned about the rise of Islamic extremism around the world, while 61% express a similar concern about the possibility of Islamic extremism in the United States.&lt;ref name="PewMainstream"/&gt;

On a small number of occasions Muslim women who wore distinctive [[hijab]] were harassed, causing some Muslim women to stay at home, while others temporarily abandoned the practice.

In 2011, The Learning Channel (TLC) broadcast a television series, ''[[All-American Muslim]]'', depicting the lives of different American Muslims in Dearborn, Michigan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tlc.howstuffworks.com/tv/all-american-muslim/about-all-american-muslim.htm |title=All-American Muslim: All-American Muslim: TLC |publisher=Tlc.howstuffworks.com |date=October 18, 2011 |accessdate=December 6, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111219054208/http://tlc.howstuffworks.com/tv/all-american-muslim/about-all-american-muslim.htm |archivedate=December 19, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even 16 years after 9/11, studies show that 42% Muslim Americans report bullying of their children in school because of their faith. One in four bullying incidents involving muslims is rerouted to have involved a teacher or other school official. Policies regarding immigration and airport security have also impacted Muslim American Lives after 9/11, with Muslims being twice as likely as any other faith group surveyed to be stopped at the border for additional screening. 67% of Muslims who were stopped at a US border also reported that they were easily identifiable as a member of their faith group. The climate of the 2016 presidential election and the policies that followed have also affected the lives and sentiments of Muslims Americans when it comes to their own safety. Muslims and Jews are, “most likely to express fear for their personal safety or that of their family from white supremacist groups as a result of the 2016 elections.” Overall, the majority of nonwhite Muslims do report some level of race-based discrimination in the past year. When it comes to religious based discrimination, Muslim Americans as a whole were the most likely faith group to report it.

A 2011 [[Pew Research Center|Pew]] poll reported support for extremism among Muslim Americans is negligible. &lt;ref name=Pew2NoSigns&gt;{{cite web |title=Muslim Americans: No Signs of Growth in Alienation or Support for Extremism |url=http://www.people-press.org/2011/08/30/muslim-americans-no-signs-of-growth-in-alienation-or-support-for-extremism/ |website=Pew Research Center |accessdate=26 September 2018 |date=30 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The poll indicated all segments of the Muslim American population were opposed to violence and to a correlation between support for suicide bombing and religiosity measures.&lt;ref name=Pew2NoSigns/&gt;  A 2007 [[Pew Research Center|Pew]] poll reported that very few Muslim Americans (1%) supported [[suicide attack|suicide bombings]] against civilian targets in at least some circumstances, with 81% reporting that suicide bombings and other forms of violence against civilians are never justified.&lt;ref name=Pew2NoSigns/&gt;  Favorable views towards Al Qaeda were held by a comparably smaller percentage among Muslim Americans,  2% very favorable and 3% somewhat favorable.&lt;ref name=Pew2NoSigns/&gt;  15% of American Muslims under the age of 30 supported [[suicide attack|suicide bombings]] against civilian targets in at least some circumstances, on the other hand, 11% said it could be "rarely justified" in a 2007 Pew poll.   Among those over the age of 30, just 6% expressed their support for the same. (9% of Muslims over 30 and 5% under 30 chose not to answer).&lt;ref name="PewMainstream"/&gt;
[[File:US Muslim opinions on suicide bombing (2011).png|thumb|350px|Based on data from a 2011 poll by the [[Pew Research Center]], this graph records the distribution of feelings of U.S. Muslims on the topic of [[suicide bombings]].]]
Terrorism that involved Muslim perpetrators began in the United States with the [[1993 shootings at CIA Headquarters]] in [[Langley, Virginia]], followed by the [[1993 World Trade Center bombing]] in New York City. After the [[September 11 attacks]] and the start of the [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|Afghanistan war]] in 2001, there was concern about the potential radicalization of American Muslims. 

Between 2001 and the end of 2009, there were 46 publicly reported incidents of "domestic radicalization and recruitment to jihadist terrorism" that involved at least 125 people between 2001 and the end of 2009. There had been an average of six cases per year since 2001, but that rose to 13 in 2009.&lt;ref name="CFR"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cfr.org/terrorism/threat-homegrown-islamist-terrorism/p11509#p1 |title=Threat of Homegrown Islamist Terrorism |publisher=Cfr.org |accessdate=December 6, 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111129212459/http://www.cfr.org/terrorism/threat-homegrown-islamist-terrorism/p11509#p1 |archivedate=November 29, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the seeming increase in cases may be alarming, half "involve single individuals, while the rest represent ‘tiny conspiracies,’ " according to Congressional testimony.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Jenkins | first1 = Brian Michael |year=2010| title = No Path to Glory: Deterring Homegrown Terrorism | journal = [[RAND Corporation]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, a 2012 study by the [[University of North Carolina]] indicated that the yearly number of cases of alleged plots by Muslim-Americans appears to be declining. The total of 20 indictments for terrorism in 2011 is down from 26 in 2010 and 47 in 2009 (the total since 9/11 is 193). The number of Muslim-Americans indicted for support of terrorism also fell, from 27 individuals in 2010 to just eight in 2011 (the total since 9/11 stands at 462).&lt;ref name="jr-tcth"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://journalistsresource.org/studies/government/criminal-justice/muslim-american-terrorism-decade-since-911/ | title=Muslim-American Terrorism in the Decade Since 9/11 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426190112/http://journalistsresource.org/studies/government/criminal-justice/muslim-american-terrorism-decade-since-911/ | archivedate=April 26, 2012 | df=mdy-all }} JournalistsResource.org, retrieved March 20, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tcth"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kurzman | first1 = Charles |year=2012| title = Muslim-American Terrorism in the Decade Since 9/11 | journal = Triangle Center on Terrorism and Homeland Security }}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in apparent decline is the number of actual attacks: Of the 20 suspects indicted for terrorism, only one was charged with carrying out a terrorist act. This number is down from the six individuals charged with attacks in 2010.&lt;ref name="tcth"/&gt;

Muslim Americans are significantly represented among those who tip authorities off to alleged plots having given 52 of the 140 documented tips regarding individuals involved in violent terrorist plots since 9/11.&lt;ref name="jr-tcth"/&gt;&lt;ref name="tcth"/&gt;

Some Muslim Americans have been criticized because of perceived conflicts between their religious beliefs and mainstream American [[value system]]s. Muslim cab drivers in Minneapolis, Minnesota have been criticized for refusing passengers for carrying alcoholic beverages or dogs.

At least one American not of recent immigrant background, [[John Walker Lindh]], has been imprisoned, convicted on charges of working with the [[Taliban]] and carrying weapons against American soldiers. He had converted to Islam while in the United States, moved to [[Yemen]] to study [[Arabic language|Arabic]], and then went to [[Pakistan]], where he was recruited by the Taliban.

Another American that was not of recent immigrant background, [[José Padilla (prisoner)|José Padilla]], of Puerto Rican descent and the first Hispanic-American to be imprisoned and convicted on suspicion of plotting a radiological bomb ("dirty bomb") attack. He was detained as a material witness until June 9, 2002, when President George W. Bush designated him an enemy combatant and, arguing that he was not entitled to trial in civilian courts, had him transferred to a military prison. He had converted to Islam while serving his last jail sentence in prison, and went to [[Pakistan]] where he was recruited into Al-Qaeda.

In 2015 four U.S. Marines were killed and three injured in [[Chattanooga, Tennessee]] by a twenty four-year-old Kuwaiti man,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jul/16/chattanooga-shooting-mohammod-youssuf-abdulazeez|title=Mohammad Youssuf Abdulazeez: everything we know about the Chattanooga gunman|first1=Amanda|last1=Holpuch|first2=Alan|last2=Yuhas|date=July 17, 2015|publisher=|accessdate=December 17, 2016|via=The Guardian|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161221122400/https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jul/16/chattanooga-shooting-mohammod-youssuf-abdulazeez|archivedate=December 21, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; a naturalized US citizen with an engineering degree.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/chattanooga-shooter-came-from-middle-class-muslim-family/2015/07/16/815c39c2-2c04-11e5-bd33-395c05608059_story.html|title=Chattanooga gunman came from a middle-class Muslim family|work=washingtonpost.com|accessdate=December 17, 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170102115824/https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/chattanooga-shooter-came-from-middle-class-muslim-family/2015/07/16/815c39c2-2c04-11e5-bd33-395c05608059_story.html|archivedate=January 2, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a 2011 Gallup poll, over the preceding decade there had been an increase in [[Islamophobia]], which it defined as "an exaggerated fear, hatred, and hostility toward Islam and Muslims that is perpetuated by negative stereotypes resulting in bias, discrimination, and the marginalization and exclusion of Muslims from social, political, and civic life."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/157082/islamophobia-understanding-anti-muslim-sentiment-west.aspx|title=Islamophobia: Understanding Anti-Muslim Sentiment in the West|publisher=Gallup, Inc.|accessdate=March 5, 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150227054910/http://www.gallup.com/poll/157082/islamophobia-understanding-anti-muslim-sentiment-west.aspx|archivedate=February 27, 2015|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another 2011 poll provided by ''[[The Washington Post]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=What most Americans think of Islam today|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/11/17/most-americans-say-islam-is-at-odds-with-american-values/|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=November 17, 2015|access-date=December 12, 2015|issn=0190-8286|language=en-US|first=Christopher|last=Ingraham|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151214200216/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/11/17/most-americans-say-islam-is-at-odds-with-american-values/|archivedate=December 14, 2015|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; through the [[Public Religion Research Institute]] states that 48 percent of Americans are uncomfortable with Muslim women wearing the burqa. A 2014 [[Pew Research Center]] survey found that Muslims were the most disliked religious group in the United States with an average "cold" rating of 40 (out of 100), which is lower than the 41 cold rating received by atheists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pewforum.org/2014/07/16/how-americans-feel-about-religious-groups/|title=How Americans Feel About Religious Groups: Jews, Catholics &amp; Evangelicals Rated Warmly, Atheists and Muslims More Coldly|publisher=Pew Research Center|date=July 16, 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170209101432/http://www.pewforum.org/2014/07/16/how-americans-feel-about-religious-groups/|archivedate=February 9, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a poll in November 2015 by the [[Public Religion Research Institute]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Survey {{!}} Anxiety, Nostalgia, and Mistrust: Findings from the 2015 American Values Survey|url=http://publicreligion.org/research/2015/11/survey-anxiety-nostalgia-and-mistrust-findings-from-the-2015-american-values-survey/#.VmtqM_mrShc|publisher=Public Religion Research Institute|accessdate=December 12, 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151210212619/http://publicreligion.org/research/2015/11/survey-anxiety-nostalgia-and-mistrust-findings-from-the-2015-american-values-survey/#.VmtqM_mrShc|archivedate=December 10, 2015|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; 56 percent of Americans believe that the values of Islam are at odds with the American values and ways of life.

Public institutions in the U.S. have also drawn fire for accommodating Islam at the expense of taxpayers. The [[University of Michigan–Dearborn]] and a public college in Minnesota have been criticized for accommodating Islamic prayer rituals by constructing footbaths for Muslim students using tax-payers' money. Critics said this special accommodation, which is made to satisfy the needs of Muslims alone, is a violation of Constitutional provisions [[separation of church and state in the United States|separating church and state]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.startribune.com/kersten/story/1115081.html Startribune.com] {{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along the same constitutional lines, a San Diego public elementary school is being criticized for making special accommodations, specifically for American Muslims, by adding Arabic to its curriculum and giving breaks for Muslim prayers. Some critics said exceptions have not been made for any religious group in the past, and they see this as an endorsement of Islam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Gao |first=Helen |url=http://www.signonsandiego.com/uniontrib/20070702/news_1n2prayer.html |title=Muslim prayers in school debated |work=The San Diego Union-Tribune |date=July 2, 2007 |accessdate=December 6, 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111201180513/http://www.signonsandiego.com/uniontrib/20070702/news_1n2prayer.html |archivedate=December 1, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first American Muslim Congressman, [[Keith Ellison (politician)|Keith Ellison]], created controversy when he compared President George W. Bush's actions after the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]] to [[Adolf Hitler]]'s actions after the Nazi-sparked [[Reichstag fire]], saying that Bush was exploiting the aftermath of 9/11 for political gain, as Hitler had exploited the Reichstag fire to suspend constitutional liberties.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2007/07/14/wbush114.xml Bush like Hitler, says first Muslim in Congress] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080224114527/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=%2Fnews%2F2007%2F07%2F14%2Fwbush114.xml |date=February 24, 2008 }} ''The Telegraph''&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United States Holocaust Memorial Museum]] and the [[Anti-Defamation League]] condemned Ellison's remarks. The congressman later retracted the statement, saying that it was "inappropriate" for him to have made the comparison.&lt;ref name="APerror"&gt;[http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2007/07/18/politics/main3069391.shtml Congressman Admits 9/11 Error] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071014032312/http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2007/07/18/politics/main3069391.shtml |date=October 14, 2007 }}, Associated Press, July 18, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

At Columbus Manor School, a suburban [[Chicago]] [[elementary school]] with a student body nearly half Muslim [[Arab American]], school board officials have considered eliminating holiday celebrations after Muslim parents complained that their culture's holidays were not included. Local parent Elizabeth Zahdan said broader inclusion, not elimination, was the group's goal. "I only wanted them modified to represent everyone," the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' quoted her as saying. "Now the kids are not being educated about other people."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.suntimes.com/news/metro/578734,CST-NWS-oaklawn28.article Sun Times] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071010050554/http://www.suntimes.com/news/metro/578734,CST-NWS-oaklawn28.article |date=October 10, 2007 }} Retrieved in 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the district's superintendent, Tom Smyth, said too much school time was being taken to celebrate holidays already, and he sent a directive to his principals requesting that they "tone down" activities unrelated to the curriculum, such as holiday parties.

'''''Jefferson Davis''''' is a statue depicting the [[Jefferson Davis|American-Confederate politician of the same name]] by [[Pompeo Coppini]]. The sculpture was commissioned in 1919 by [[George W. Littlefield]] to be included in the [[Littlefield Fountain]] on the campus of the [[University of Texas at Austin]]. It was installed on the university's South Mall from 1933 to 2015, when it was relocated to the [[Dolph Briscoe Center for American History]] in [[Austin, Texas]].

==History==
{{Further|Littlefield Fountain}}
In 1919, University of Texas regent [[George W. Littlefield]] donated funds to pay for the construction of a "Memorial Gateway" at the south entrance to the university's campus that would honor the [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] dead from the [[American Civil War|Civil War]]. He hired [[San Antonio]]-based Italian-born sculptor [[Pompeo Coppini]] to design the monument, which was to include a number of statues of notable figures from the history of Texas and the American South. The memorial was ultimately redesigned as the [[Littlefield Fountain]] and instead dedicated to the university's students and alumni who had died in the Great War (now known as [[World War I]]).&lt;ref name="Nicar2001"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Jim Nicar|title=Symbolism Amok|journal=[[The Alcalde]]|date=May 2001|volume=89|issue=5|page=79|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Xs0DAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA80|publisher=Emmis Communications|accessdate=November 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As part of the memorial project, in the 1920s Coppini sculpted bronze statues of [[Jefferson Davis]] and five other Texan and Confederate notables selected by Littlefield, which he intended to display around the fountain. However, as construction on the memorial proceeded in the early 1930s, campus architect [[Paul Cret]] decided to instead install the six statues along the university's South Mall, where they were placed in 1933 as the construction of the fountain complex was completed.&lt;ref name="Nicar2001"/&gt;

===Controversy and relocation===
{{Further|Removal of Confederate monuments and memorials}}
Beginning in 2015 and accelerating in 2017, a national controversy grew over the prominent positions of monuments and memorials to the Confederacy in many public spaces across the United States, and particularly in the American South.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/08/16/us/confederate-monuments-removed.html|title=Confederate Monuments Are Coming Down Across the United States|first=Chris|last=Kenning|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=August 15, 2017|accessdate=November 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this context, the statues of Confederate notables along the university's South Mall that Coppini had designed for the Littlefield Fountain attracted increased public criticism.

In March 2015, UT's student government passed a resolution calling for the removal of ''Jefferson Davis'' from the South Mall.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Written in Stone: History of racism lives on in UT monuments|newspaper=[[The Austin Chronicle]]|first=Mac|last=McCann|date=May 29, 2015|url=https://www.austinchronicle.com/news/2015-05-29/written-in-stone/|accessdate=November 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; That August, the university in fact removed the statues of both Davis and [[Woodrow Wilson]] from the Mall and placed them in storage, despite a lawsuit from the Texas Division of the [[Sons of Confederate Veterans]], which failed to persuade the [[Texas Supreme Court]] to block the plan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Crews remove Jefferson Davis, Woodrow Wilson statues from UT Main Mall|newspaper=[[Austin American-Statesman]]|first=Ralph K.M.|last=Haurwitz|date=August 30, 2015|url=http://www.statesman.com/news/local/crews-remove-jefferson-davis-woodrow-wilson-statues-from-main-mall/5uZnpjAnISv0YtFSnHreTL/|accessdate=November 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2015/08/30/436072805/jefferson-davis-statue-comes-down-at-university-of-texas|title=Jefferson Davis Statue Comes Down at University of Texas|publisher=[[NPR]]|accessdate=July 31, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Davis'' was later relocated to the university's [[Dolph Briscoe Center for American History]], where it has been displayed since 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dallasnews.com/opinion/commentary/2017/04/07/jefferson-davis-statue-returns-university-texas|title=Jefferson Davis statue returns to University of Texas|date=7 April 2017|work=[[The Dallas Morning News]]|accessdate=July 31, 2017|publisher=[[A.

'''Joan Ganz Cooney''' (born '''Joan Ganz'''; November 30, 1929&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://joanganzcooneycenter.org/about-us/legacy/ |title=Our Legacy |website=Joan Ganz Cooney Center |language=en-US |access-date=November 29, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;) is an American television producer. She is one of the founders of [[Sesame Workshop]] (originally ''Children's Television Workshop'' or CTW), the organization famous for the creation of the [[Children's television series|children's television show]] ''[[Sesame Street]]'', which was also co-created by her. Ganz Cooney grew up in Phoenix, Arizona and earned a B.A. degree in education from the [[University of Arizona]] in 1951. After working for the [[United States Department of State|State Department]] in Washington, D.C. and as a journalist in Phoenix, she worked as a publicist for television and production companies in New York City. In 1961, she became interested in working for educational television, and became a documentary producer for New York's first educational TV station [[WNET]] (Channel 13). Many of the programs she produced won local Emmys.

In 1966, Ganz Cooney hosted what she called "a little dinner party"&lt;ref name="archive3"/&gt; at her apartment near [[Gramercy Park]].  In attendance was her then-husband Tim Cooney, her boss Lewis Freedman, and [[Lloyd Morrisett]], an executive at the [[Carnegie Corporation]], in which the potential of television to teach young children was discussed. Ganz Cooney was chosen to oversee and direct the creation of what eventually became the children's television program ''Sesame Street'', which premiered in 1969, and the CTW, the organization that oversaw its production. Ganz Cooney was named CTW's first executive director. As one of the first female executives in American television, her appointment was called "one of the most important television developments of the decade".&lt;ref name="davis128129"/&gt;

Ganz Cooney remained executive director of the CTW until 1990, when she became the chair of CTW's executive board. She served on several boards, was the trustees of many organizations, and received many awards and honorary degrees. In 2007, the Sesame Workshop founded [[The Joan Ganz Cooney Center]], named in her honor.

==Early life and education==

Joan Ganz was born on November 30, 1929, in Phoenix, Arizona, to Sylvan Ganz, a banker, and Pauline (née Reddon), a homemaker. Her father was a native [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenician]] who was born in the U.S. so that his mother could receive medical care after his birth.&lt;ref name="archive1"/&gt;  Her grandfather [[Emil Ganz]] was a tailor from [[Walldorf, Thuringia]], in Germany, who immigrated to the U.S. in 1858 and was president of the First National Bank of Arizona and mayor of Phoenix for three terms.&lt;ref name="davis-18"/&gt;  Joan Ganz was the youngest of three siblings.&lt;ref name="davis-17"/&gt;  She described her childhood as "upper middle class, country club atmosphere" and stated, "I was raised in the most conventional way, raised to be a housewife and a mother, to work an interesting job when I got out of college, and to marry at the appropriate age, which would have been twenty-five".&lt;ref name="odell-67"/&gt; Her father was Jewish and her mother was Catholic.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2199&amp;dat=19850716&amp;id=8rkxAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=k-UFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5515,3320603]&lt;/ref&gt;

She attended [[North High School (Phoenix, Arizona)|North High School]] in Phoenix, where she was active in school plays. She stated that her biggest influence as a teenager was her teacher Bud Brown, whose lectures about the [[civil rights movement]], poverty, the free press, and [[antisemitism]] in Europe "absolutely inflamed"&lt;ref name="archive1"/&gt; her and changed her life.&lt;ref name="odell-67"/&gt; Brown was later investigated as a [[Communist]].&lt;ref name="davis-22"/&gt; She went to [[Dominican University of California|Dominican College]], an all-girls Catholic institution in [[San Rafael, California]] for a year before transferring to the [[University of Arizona]] in 1948.&lt;ref name="davis-23"/&gt; She stopped acting in college because her father refused to support her in that career. She chose education, even though she was not interested in becoming a teacher, on the recommendation of her mother&lt;ref name="archive1"/&gt; and because as she later stated, "It was something that girls of my generation did because teaching was acceptable".&lt;ref name="odell-68"/&gt;

==Early career==

After graduating in 1951, Ganz Cooney moved to [[Washington, D.C.]], where she worked as a clerk and typist at the [[United States Department of State|State Department]]. She was exposed to Father [[James Keller|James Keller's]] [[The Christophers|Christopher Movement]], which inspired her to become involved with television and the media. Ganz Cooney later said, "Father Keller said that if idealists didn't go into the media, nonidealists would".&lt;ref name="odell-68"/&gt;  She returned to Phoenix and despite no experience in [[journalism]],&lt;ref name="davis-24"/&gt; took a job as a reporter at the ''[[Arizona Republic]]''.  Eighteen months later, in 1953 and at the age of 23, she moved to New York City and was a [[public relations|publicist]] for the next ten years, initially for [[David Sarnoff]] at [[RCA]], then at [[NBC]] writing [[press release]]s and [[soap opera]] synopses,&lt;ref name="odell-68"/&gt; and then for the ''[[United States Steel Hour]]'' at [[CBS]].&lt;ref name="archive1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="gikow-18"/&gt;  During this time, she became involved with liberal [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] politics and "fell in with a literary set of young writers and editors who gathered at the West Side apartment of ''[[Partisan Review]]'' editor [[William Phillips (editor)|William Phillips]]". Some of this "notable group" included [[Jason Epstein]] and [[Norman Mailer]].&lt;ref name="odell-68"/&gt; In 1956, after many years of depression, Ganz Cooney's father committed suicide at his home in Phoenix.&lt;ref name="davis2829"/&gt;

While Ganz Cooney was working for the ''U.S. Steel Hour'', a colleague left to work for the educational television station [[WGBH-TV]] in Boston; her reaction was life-changing: "What?!  There is educational television?!"&lt;ref name="gikow-18"/&gt;  She later stated, "I knew that I was born to be in educational television; it was [[Conversion of Paul the Apostle|St. Paul on the highway]]".&lt;ref name="archive2"/&gt;  In 1961, she began to track the progress of a court case in which a New York City nonprofit group was attempting to acquire [[Newark, New Jersey]]-based [[Independent station (North America)|independent station]] WNTA-TV (channel 13), which would become the precursor of [[PBS]] station [[WNET]], the first public television station in the New York area.&lt;ref name="hellman-51"/&gt;  When channel 13 became [[noncommercial educational|non-commercial]] two years later as WNDT, Ganz Cooney applied for a position as the station's publicist, but the general manager told her they needed producers. "I can produce", she told him, even though she had no experience in producing television shows.  She later stated, "I've never been qualified for any job I've been hired for".&lt;ref name="odell-68"/&gt;  According to television historian Cary O'Dell, WNDT hired her because of the ties she had made through her political activities and associations with ''Partisan Review''.&lt;ref name="odell-68"/&gt;  Ganz Cooney later said during an interview with the [[Archive of American Television]] that the transition to becoming a documentary producer was not difficult for her because she was well-read and aware of the issues of the day, adding, "I felt like I'd died and gone to heaven, dealing with foreign policy and domestic policy and civil rights, which became the great passion in those years for me".&lt;ref name="archive2"/&gt;

Taking a pay cut,&lt;ref name="davis-70"/&gt; Ganz Cooney and her boss Lewis Freedman produced what author Michael Davis called "a series of [[teach-in]]s on major issues".&lt;ref name="davis-71"/&gt;  One of her first programs was called ''Court of Reason'', a weekly live debate show; notable guests included [[Malcolm X]] and [[Calvin Butts]].  She produced a debate show on America's policy about Cuba that aired the week before the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]]. She also produced another debate show called ''Poverty, Anti-Poverty, and the World'', in which poor people were brought into the studio to confront the government officials responsible for developing [[poverty reduction|anti-poverty program]]s.&lt;ref name="gikow-18"/&gt;&lt;ref name="archive2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="hellman-51"/&gt;  Although the ratings were low, Ganz Cooney and Freedman won [[Emmy Award|Emmys]] for its production, and as Davis stated, "the viewers who did tune in were serious-minded adults who cared about matters of race, injustice, and the imbalance of opportunity in New York and beyond".&lt;ref name="davis-71"/&gt;  She also produced inexpensively-made documentaries that she later called "Little [[Grandma Moses]] documentaries"&lt;ref name="davis-70"/&gt; for WNDT that were well received by their viewers,&lt;ref name="davis-71"/&gt; including ''A Chance at the Beginning'', which featured the precursor of [[Head Start Program|Head Start]] that won her a local Emmy and was later used to train Head Start teachers.&lt;ref name="gikow-20"/&gt;  She later reported that WNDT had won eight out of 13 New York Emmys in one year.&lt;ref name="archive2"/&gt;

In February 1964, at age 34, she married Timothy Cooney, a staff member of New York mayor [[Robert Wagner, Jr.]] They met while she was working on ''A Chance at the Beginning''.&lt;ref name="archive2"/&gt;  He was also director of public relations for the New York City Department of Labor and director of New York's Office of Civil Defense.  Timothy Cooney would eventually become "an unpaid advocate for the urban poor".&lt;ref name="odell-69"/&gt;  Ganz Cooney credited him, whom Davis called "a radical feminist",&lt;ref name="davis-63"/&gt; for making her into a feminist, and later said that he was very supportive and encouraging.&lt;ref name="odell-69"/&gt;  Davis called the Cooneys "a delightfully unmatched set, a [[Spencer Tracy]] and [[Katharine Hepburn]] twosome who married despite differences in upbringing, station, and sobriety".&lt;ref name="davis-64"/&gt;

==''Sesame Street'' and the Children's Television Workshop==
In the winter of 1966, Ganz Cooney hosted what she called "a little dinner party"&lt;ref name="archive3"/&gt; at her apartment near [[Gramercy Park]].  In attendance was her husband, her boss Lewis Freedman, and Lloyd and Mary Morrisett, whom the Cooneys knew socially.&lt;ref name="davis-12"/&gt;  [[Lloyd Morrisett]] was a mid-level executive at  [[Carnegie Corporation]] (who later became its CEO), and was then responsible for funding educational research. The conversation turned to the possibilities of using television to educate young children; Morrisett raised the question, "Do you think television could be used to teach young children?" Ganz Cooney replied, "I don't know, but I'd like to talk about it."&lt;ref name="davis-16"/&gt;  According to Davis, the party was the start of a five-decade long professional relationship between Ganz Cooney and Morrisett.&lt;ref name="davis-16"/&gt;  A week later, Ganz Cooney and Freedman met with Morrisett at the offices of Carnegie Corporation to discuss doing a feasibility study on creating an educational television program for preschoolers.&lt;ref name="morrow-47"/&gt;  Freedman was opposed to Ganz Cooney's involvement because he did not think she would be interested in a project that focused on children and because he did not want to lose her at WNDT, but she was chosen to do the study.&lt;ref name="archive3"/&gt;

In the summer of 1967, Ganz Cooney took a leave of absence from WNDT and, funded by Carnegie Corporation, traveled the U.S. and Canada interviewing experts in child development, education, and television.  She reported her findings in a fifty-five-page document entitled "The Potential Uses of Television in Preschool Education".&lt;ref name="davis6667"/&gt;  The report, which Gikow called "a schematic for the show ''Sesame Street'' would become",&lt;ref name="gikow-21"/&gt; described what the new show would look like and proposed the creation of a company that oversaw its production, which eventually became known as the [[Children's Television Workshop]] (CTW).&lt;ref name="archive3"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;In 2000, the CTW [http://www.muppetcentral.com/news/2000/060500.shtml changed its name to Sesame Workshop (SW).]&lt;/ref&gt;  Ganz Cooney later stated that her undergraduate training in Education helped her research and write the study, and that it, along with her Emmy, provided her with credibility in the eyes of both the experts she interviewed and the new show's funding sources.&lt;ref name="archive3"/&gt;  Davis credited Ganz Cooney's motivation to be involved with the project with her journalism skills, learned early in her career, and her idealism, which drove her to want to, as she put it, "make a difference".&lt;ref name="odell-70"/&gt;  She later told an interviewer, "I could do a thousand documentaries on poverty and poor people that would be watched by a handful of the convinced, but I was never really going to have an influence on my times".&lt;ref name="odell-70"/&gt;  She later told Davis, "Preschoolers were not necessarily my thing.  It was using television in a constructive way that turned me on".&lt;ref name="davis-61"/&gt;

At first, Ganz Cooney assumed that the project would be produced by WNDT, but when the station's owner rejected the proposal and questioned Ganz Cooney's credentials, she left the station and went to the Carnegie Corporation as a full-time consultant in May 1967.&lt;ref name="morrow-53"/&gt;  For the next two years, Ganz Cooney and Morrisett worked on researching and developing the new show, raising $8 million for ''Sesame Street'', and establishing the CTW.&lt;ref name="morrow-71"/&gt;  According to Davis, despite her leadership in the project's initial research and development, Ganz Cooney's installment as CTW's executive director was put in doubt due to her lack of high-level managerial experience and leadership, untested financial management skills, and lack of experience in children's television and education. Davis also speculated that sexism was involved, stating, "Doubters also questioned whether a woman could gain the full confidence of a quorum of men from the federal government and two elite philanthropies, institutions whose wealth exceeded the gross national product of entire countries".&lt;ref name="davis-124"/&gt;  At first, Ganz Cooney did not fight for the position, but with the support of her husband and Morrisett, and after the investors of the project realized that they could not move forward without her, Ganz Cooney pursued it and was named executive director of CTW in February 1968.&lt;ref name="davis125126"/&gt;  As one of the first female executives in American television, her appointment was called "one of the most important television developments of the decade".&lt;ref name="davis128129"/&gt;

''Sesame Street'' premiered on PBS on November 10, 1969.&lt;ref name="davis-192"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mitgang|first=Lee D.|title=Big Bird and Beyond: The New Media and the Markle Foundation|year=2000|publisher=Fordham University Press|location=Bronx NY|isbn=0823220419|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kbI8kJqBM5oC&amp;pg=PA17&amp;dq=November+10,+1969+sesame&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=BZTYUOvSIsLg2QWnxYHoCw&amp;ved=0CFYQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&amp;q=November%2010%2C%201969%20sesame&amp;f=false|accessdate=December 24, 2012|page=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In its first season, the show won three Emmys, a [[Peabody Award|Peabody]], and was featured on the cover of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine.&lt;ref name="davis-8"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sesame Street: TV's gift to children|url=http://www.time.com/time/covers/0,16641,19701123,00.html|work=TIME Magazine|accessdate=December 24, 2012|date=November 23, 1970}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''[[Newsday]]'', "Scores of glowing newspaper and magazine stories fluttered down on Mrs. Cooney and her workshop like confetti onto the heads of conquering heroes".&lt;ref name="davis-197"/&gt;  Les Brown of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' called Ganz Cooney "St. Joan".&lt;ref name="morrow-49"/&gt; Ganz Cooney later reported, "The reception was so incredible.  The press adored us; the parents adored us."&lt;ref name="archive5"/&gt;  The first year ''Sesame Street'' was on the air, Ganz Cooney was, as Davis put it, "inundated with attention".&lt;ref name="davis-199"/&gt; Ganz Cooney reported that the requests for interviews from the press "were endless",&lt;ref name="davis-199"/&gt; and attributed it to the emergence of the women's movement in the early 1970s.  Ganz Cooney also testified before Congressional hearings on children and television, starting before the show's premiere.&lt;ref name="davis-199"/&gt;

In 1969, the Cooneys, who were childless,&lt;ref name="archive9"/&gt; became "''de facto'' foster parents to an inner-city black child"&lt;ref name="davis-261"/&gt;  whom Tim met while working in Harlem for a civil rights organization.  Eventually, the child returned to live with his mother and was killed in New York City before he turned 30.&lt;ref name="davis261263"/&gt;  The Cooneys' marriage, which Davis called "turbulent",&lt;ref name="davis-261"/&gt; ended in 1975.&lt;ref name="davis-163"/&gt;  Due to Tim's long history of alcoholism, he was unable to support himself, so Ganz Cooney paid him [[alimony]] until his death in 1999.&lt;ref name="davis-264"/&gt;&lt;ref name="davis-341"/&gt;  In August 1975, nine months after separating from her husband, Ganz Cooney was diagnosed with breast cancer and underwent a radical [[mastectomy]].&lt;ref name="odell-74"/&gt; In 1980, Ganz Cooney married businessman [[Peter G. Peterson]], former [[U.S. Secretary of Commerce]] under President [[Richard Nixon]].&lt;ref name="odell-75"/&gt;  They met when Peterson was on the board of [[National Educational Television]], during her presentation of ''Sesame Street'' to them.&lt;ref name="archive6"/&gt;  From her marriage to Peterson, she has five stepchildren.&lt;ref name="odell-75"/&gt;

==Later years==
Ganz Cooney remained the chairman and chief executive officer of the CTW until 1990, when she stepped down and was replaced by David Britt, whom Ganz Cooney called her "right-hand for many years".&lt;ref name="archive9"/&gt;  Britt had worked for her at the CTW since 1975 and had been its president and chief operating officer since 1988.&lt;ref name="stepdown"/&gt;  At that time, she became chairman of the CTW's executive board, which oversaw its businesses and licensing, and became more involved in the organization's creative side.&lt;ref name="stepdown"/&gt;  
Cooney served on several committees and corporate boards, including the [[Mayo Foundation]], [[Chase Manhattan Bank]], [[Johnson &amp; Johnson]], and [[Metropolitan Life Insurance]].&lt;ref name="odell-75"/&gt;  Ganz Cooney recognized that she was invited to serve on these boards because she was a woman, and because companies were trying to be more inclusive.  She also did some public speaking on the behalf of the CTW and returning to her roots, worked on documentaries. She credited her involvement with the boards with teaching her how to run an organization and about the business world.&lt;ref name="archive9"/&gt;  In 1990, she was the first female nonperformer to be inducted into the [[Academy of Television Arts &amp; Sciences]] Hall of Fame, and was given the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]] by President [[Bill Clinton]] in 1995.&lt;ref name="oneill-146"/&gt;

In 2007, Sesame Workshop founded [[The Joan Ganz Cooney Center]], an independent, non-profit organization which studies how to improve children's literacy by using and developing digital technologies "grounded in detailed educational curriculum", just as was done during the development of ''Sesame Street''.&lt;ref name="jensen"/&gt; In 2014, [[Public Prep]] launched a full day pre-kindergarten program for low-income 4 year olds living in South Bronx [[New York City Housing Authority|NYC Housing Authority]] projects, called the Joan Ganz Cooney Early Learning Program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Sahm|first=Charles|title=De Blasio should endorse pre-K at charter schools|url=https://nypost.com/2014/03/25/de-blasio-needs-to-extend-olive-branch-in-charter-school-war/|accessdate=May 31, 2014|newspaper=NY Post|date=May 25, 2014|location=New York NY}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''learned pig''' was a pig taught to respond to commands in such a way that it appeared to be able to answer questions by picking up cards in its mouth. By choosing cards it answered [[Arithmetics|arithmetical problems]] and spelled out words. The "learned pig" caused a sensation in London during the 1780s. It became a common object of satire, illustrated in caricatures and referred to in literature.

The original "learned pig" was followed by other trained pigs, which subsequently became a feature of fairs and other public attractions in Europe and America during the 19th century. In the words of G.E. Bentley, "They served as subjects for cartoons by Rowlandson and moral essays in children's books and savage doggerel by Blake, and they illustrated the manners of the English in works by Joseph Strutt and Robert Southey and Thomas Hood. These freaks of learning clearly exercised a fascination among the literary geniuses of the age as they did among the swinish multitude."&lt;ref name = "bent"&gt;G.E. Bentley, "The Freaks of Learning", ''Colby Quarterly'', Vol. 18, Iss. 2, 1982, Art. 3, pp.88-104.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The original pig==
The original Learned Pig was trained by a Scotsman Samuel Bisset, who ran a travelling novelty show. The idea of an "intellectual" animal was not new. A similar attraction known as "[[Bankes's Horse|Marocco]] the thinking horse" (c.1586–c.1606) had been exhibited over a century earlier; there were also contemporary examples of the "horse of knowledge", exhibited for example at [[Astley's Amphitheatre]].&lt;ref&gt;Barbara M. Benedict, ''Curiosity: A Cultural History of Early Modern Inquiry'', University of Chicago Press, 2002, p.206.&lt;/ref&gt; But performing horses were nothing unusual. No performing pigs are known to have been trained before.

The pig was shown with great success in Dublin. After Bisset's death the pig was taken over by a Mr Nicholson, who toured it in Britain.&lt;ref name ="jan"&gt;Jan Bondeson, ''The feejee mermaid and other essays in natural and unnatural history'', Cornell University Press, 1999, pp.20-28&lt;/ref&gt; It was exhibited in Nottingham in 1784, coming to London in the following year."&lt;ref name = "bent"/&gt; According to publicity at the time,

&lt;blockquote&gt;This entertaining and sagacious animal casts accounts by means of Typographical cards, in the same manner as a Printer composes, and by the same method sets down any capital or Surname, reckons the number of People present, tells by evoking on a Gentleman's Watch in company what is the Hour and Minutes; he likewise tells any Lady's Thoughts in company, and distinguishes all sorts of colours.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The show was a great success, and the pig later toured the provincial towns, returning to London later in the year and then moving on to the continent of Europe. After a career of four years a report stated that the pig died in 1788. However, a later report claimed that it had just returned from France following the revolution of 1789, and was ready to "discourse on the Feudal System, the Rights of Kings and the Destruction of the Bastille".&lt;ref name ="jan"/&gt;

The phenomenon caused much comment. [[James Boswell]] recalls conversations with [[Samuel Johnson]] in which he joked about the pig's scholarship. Johnson never saw the pig. He died just before it came to London, but he commented on a report of its show in Nottingham. He suggested that  "the pigs are a race unjustly calumniated. ''Pig'' has, it seems, not been wanting to ''man'', but ''man'' to ''pig''. We do not allow ''time'' for his education, we kill him at a year old." Another man present joked that [[Alexander Pope]] would not have used the pig as a symbol of "the lowest degree of grovelling instinct" in his works if this creature had been known to him, but added that the pig had probably been subject to some form of torture to force it to respond to commands. Johnson replied that at least it had escaped slaughter: "the pig has no cause to complain; he would have been killed the first year if he had not been ''educated'', and protracted existence is a good recompence for very considerable degrees of torture."&lt;ref&gt;Boswell, ''Life of Johnson'', July 12, 1784.&lt;/ref&gt;

The discussion about how the pig had been trained also led to disputes about the cognitive abilities of pigs; whether the animal actually recognised letters or even words, or whether it was simply responding to direct prompting. The phenomenon was also discussed in instructional literature aimed at children, to describe the essential difference between human and animal capacities and to warn against cruelty to animals, on the assumption that the pigs were badly beaten by their trainers to force them to behave. Mrs Trimmer in her children's book ''The Robin Redbreasts'' (1788), "designed to teach children the proper treatment of animals", mentions the pig in chapter entitled "The Cruel Boy": aiming to teach that animals are not "mere machines, actuated by the unerring hand of Providence", it says that the sight of the Learned Pig, "which has lately been shown in London, has deranged these ideas, and I know not what think".

==Later pigs==
[[File:Toby the sapient pig.jpg|thumb|left|Poster for Toby the Sapient Pig]]
In 1798 a learned pig appeared in the United States. William Frederick Pinchbeck displayed a "Pig of Knowledge" in [[New England]]. He claimed to have toured all the major towns of the Union and introduced the pig to President [[John Adams]], to "universal applause".&lt;ref&gt;David Morgan, Sally M. Promey, ''The visual culture of American religions'', University of California Press, 2001, p.212.&lt;/ref&gt; Pinchbeck later explained his methods of training the pig in a pamphlet.&lt;ref&gt;F. W. Pinchbeck, ''The Expositor, or, Many Mysteries Unravelled. Delineated in a Series of Letters, between a Friend and his Correspondent. Comprising the Learned Pig, Invisible Lady and Acoustic Temple, Philosophical Swan, Penetrating Spy Glasses, Optical and Magnetic, and Various other Curiosities on similar Principles: Also, A few of the most wonderful Feats as performed by the Art of Legerdemain: With Some Reflections on Ventriloquism'', Boston, 1805.&lt;/ref&gt; He denied that any form of torture was involved, insisting that it was better to "coax" the pig to follow instructions. The animal would soon learn to respond to the slightest hints of movement from the trainer.&lt;ref name = "bent"/&gt; He stated that credulous spectators accused him of using witchcraft, one stating that "his performances were the effects of the Black Art; that the Pig ought to be burnt, and the Man banished, as he had no doubt but...[his trainer] familiarly corresponded with the devil." Others suggested that the pig was evidence of reincarnation: "the spirit of the grunting philosopher might once have animated a man."&lt;ref name = "bent"/&gt;

In the early 19th century, Nicholas Hoare, an illusionist, exhibited "Toby the sapient pig" in London. Toby could "discover a person’s thoughts", a skill "never heard of before to be exhibited by an animal of the swine race". Around 1817 Toby also published an autobiography, ''The life and adventures of Toby, the sapient pig: with his opinions on men and manners. Written by himself''.

A pig owned by Pinchbeck was shown in London between 1818 and 1823. According to his publicity, the pig had acquired his wisdom from "Souchanguyee, the Chinese Philosopher." He answered questions by "pointing to cards, letters, and persons in the audience."&lt;ref&gt;R. D. Altick, ''The Shows of London'' (1978), p. 37-9.&lt;/ref&gt;

"Toby" became a standard name for a learned pig. The writer Harrison Weir depicts a learned pig called Toby, which he saw a "year ago at Camberwell Fair" for a penny. According to Harrison, the pig carried a correctly numbered card to a person who had called out a number; it spelled "vittels," and then it left to have some, "with a joyful grunt, and the show was over."&lt;ref name = "bent"/&gt;

==Caricature==
[[File:Downfall of taste.JPG|thumb|''The Downfall of Taste and Genius'' (1784). The classical muses flee while the Learned Pig leads an assault on the arts, as Shakespeare's and Pope's works are cast aside.]]

The original learned pig inspired a large number of satirical comments and comic prints. [[Thomas Rowlandson]] published a caricature of "The Wonderful Pig"  in 1785, in which the pig is shown displaying his erudition to a crowd of amazed ladies and gentlemen. A placard states "The Surprising PIG well versed in all Languages, perfect Arethmatician Mathematician &amp; Composer of Musick."&lt;ref name ="mar"&gt;Mary George, ''Catalogue of the Political and Personal Satires preserved in the Department of Prints and Drawings in the British Museum'', Vol. VI 1784— 1792, British Museum, 1938, pp. xxvi, 197; 259.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other caricatures used the appeal of the pig to poke fun at theatrical fads of the day. ''The Theatrical War'' satirises the actor-impresario [[John Palmer (actor)|John Palmer]], dressed in Shakespearean costume, being threatened by other attractions including the pig.

The 1784 print ''The Downfall of Taste and Genius, or, The World As it Goes'' by [[Samuel Collings]] ridicules "the taste that prefers the Dancing Dogs, the Learned Pig, and Harlequin to Shakespeare". This was a "recurrent theme" of prints at the time.&lt;ref name ="mar"/&gt; The print depicts the pig leading a procession of performing animals who knock over figures representing the fine arts while copies of Shakespeare's and Pope's works are trampled underfoot by the animals.&lt;ref name ="mar"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Paul Keen, "The 'Ballonomania': Science and Spectacle in 1780s England", ''Eighteenth-Century Studies'', 39/4, 2006, p.527.&lt;/ref&gt;

An anonymous print entitled "The Wonderful Pig of Knowledge" shows a pig performing in a parlour apparently engaged in spelling the word "PORC[INE]"

Politicians were also satirised by being compared to the pig. [[William Pitt the younger|William Pitt]] was referred to as "the Wonderful Pig" on several occasions. One satirical print showed Pitt with the body of a pig; the caption asserted that among his powers was the ability to explain recent Acts of Parliament, a feat "before never having been even ''attempted'' in these our realms!!!" In one print Pitt and his opponent [[Charles James Fox]] were both depicted as competing learned pigs.&lt;ref name ="jan"/&gt;

==Literature==
[[File:Toby learned pig.JPG|left|thumb|Toby learning Latin grammar, a caricature by [[John Leech (caricaturist)|John Leech]].]]
The concept of the "learned pig" became a common motif in satirical literature by the late 18th century, playing on the implied contrast between gross physicality and intellectual superiority. The poet [[William Cowper]] lamented that his fame had been unfavourably compared to both the pig and a "prostitute" (the notoriously promiscuous actress [[George Anne Bellamy|Anne Bellamy]]).&lt;ref name ="jan"/&gt; A poem published in 1785 referred to the fact that the pig had arrived in London just after Johnson's death,

:Though Johnson, learned Bear, is gone,
:Let us no longer mourn our loss,
:For lo, a learned Hog is come,
:And wisdom grunts at Charing Cross.

The anonymous pamphlet ''The Story of the Learned Pig, By an officer of the Royal Navy'' (1786) picked up the theme of reincarnation. This presents itself as the personal reminiscences of the pig, as told to the author. He describes himself as a soul that has successively migrated from the body of [[Romulus]] into various humans and animals before becoming the Learned Pig. He recalls his previous incarnations. After Romulus he became [[Marcus Junius Brutus|Brutus]], and then entered several human and animal bodies. Adapting the Shakespeare theme, the pamphlet states that he became a man called "Pimping Billy", who worked as a horse-holder at a playhouse with Shakespeare and was the real author of his plays. He then became a famous British aristocrat and general — identified only by asterisks — before entering the body of a pig.&lt;ref&gt;McMichael, George L.; Glenn, Edgar M. (1962), Shakespeare and His Rivals: A Casebook on the Authorship Controversy, Odyssey Press, p.56.&lt;/ref&gt;

Puns on the name "Bacon", referring to the philosopher [[Francis Bacon]], also appeared in the literature. In the poem "The Prophetic Pig", in ''The Whim of the Day'' (c.1794) a believer in reincarnation states, "I can easily trace...A metempsychosis in this pig's face!...And in transmigration, if I'm not mistaken,/This learned pig must be, by consanguinity,/Descended from the great Lord Bacon."&lt;ref&gt;Reprinted under the title "The Fortune Teller" in [[Thomas Tegg]], ''The Vocal Annual, or Singer's own book for 1831: a collection of the newest and most popular songs of the day'', London Tegg, 1831, p.275-7.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thomas Hood]]'s poem ''The Lament of Toby, The Learned Pig'' also uses the Bacon pun, adding another on the poet [[James Hogg]]. He describes the thoughts of a learned pig forced to retire from his intellectual pursuits to be fattened for slaughter. The pig says "Goodbye to the poetic Hogg!/The philosophic Bacon!":

:In this world, pigs, as well as men,
:Must dance to fortune's fiddlings,
:But must I give the classics up,
:For barley-meal and middlings?

[[William Blake]] attacked debased public taste in a poem dedicated to the artist [[James Barry (painter)|James Barry]], writing that the nation which neglected Barry might "give pensions to the Learned Pig / Or the Hare playing on a Tabor".&lt;ref name = "cat"&gt;V.A.C. Cattrell, ''City of laughter: sex and satire in eighteenth-century London'', Atlantic, 2006, p.42-3.&lt;/ref&gt; He also alludes to it in his satire ''[[An Island in the Moon]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Ackroyd, ''Blake'', London: Vintage, 1995, pp.92-5&lt;/ref&gt; In 1807 [[Robert Southey]] parodied the contrast between real genius and meretricious celebrity by referring to the pig, noting that "the learned pig was in his day a far greater object of admiration to the English nation than ever was Sir Isaac Newton."&lt;ref name = "cat"/&gt; [[William Wordsworth]] refers to the pig in ''[[The Prelude]]'', describing it as one of the "freaks of nature" to be seen at [[Bartholomew Fair]]:

:...Albinos, painted Indians, Dwarfs,
:The Horse of knowledge, and the learned Pig
:All out-o'-the-way, far-fetched, perverted things,
:All freaks of nature, all Promethean thoughts
:Of man, his dulness, madness, and their feats
:All jumbled up together, to compose
:A Parliament of Monsters.&lt;ref&gt;William Wordsworth, ''The Prelude'', Book VII, lines 715-721&lt;/ref&gt;

The pig continued to be a common reference point for writers, mentioned by [[Mary Wollstonecraft]] and [[Charles Dickens]] among others. In ''[[The Mudfog Papers]]'' Dickens describes a moving lecture given at the ''Mudfog Society for the Advancement of Everything'' by Mr Blunderum on the dying moments of the learned pig. The lecturer was asked whether the learned pig was related to the [[Pig-faced women#The Pig-faced Lady of Manchester Square|Pig-faced Lady]], causing embarrassment to an audience member who ''was'' related to the lady, but who refused to admit a family connection to the learned pig.

Even [[Mrs Beeton]] begins her recipe for cooking sucking pig with the observation that pigs are capable of "education" "and though, like the ass, naturally stubborn and obstinate, that he is equally amenable with other animals to caresses and kindness". This is proven by "the instance of the learned pig, first exhibited about a century since, but which has been continued down to our own time by repeated instances of an animal who will put together all the letters or figures that compose the day, month, hour and date of the exhibition, besides many other unquestioned evidences of memory."&lt;ref&gt;''Mrs Beeton's Book of Household Management'' (Nicola Humble, editor), Oxford University Press, Oxford, 2000, p.196.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most recently, the "Learned Pig" has made a reappearance of sorts in popular culture; in 2003 he was the subject of a song, "The Learned Pig," which was part of a concept concert and recording by the UK band the [[Tiger Lillies]], based on a poem by [[Edward Gorey]]. The musical "Toby the Incredible Learned Pig", written by Daniel Freedman, was a finalist in the Wonderland One Act Festival at Theater Works 42nd St. NYC in 2007. In 2011 there appeared a novel, ''Pyg: The Memoirs of a Learned Pig'', by [[Russell Potter]], based on the career of the original "Toby". ({{ISBN|0857862405}})

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5157">'''Lydia Fairchild''' is an [[Americans|American]] woman who exhibits [[chimera (genetics)|chimerism]], in having two distinct populations of DNA among the cells of her body.  She was pregnant with her third child when she and the father of her children, Jamie Townsend, separated. When Fairchild applied for enforcement of child support in 2002, providing [[DNA profiling|DNA evidence]] of Townsend's paternity was a routine requirement. While the results showed Townsend to be certainly their father, they seemed to rule out her being their mother.

Fairchild stood accused of fraud by either claiming benefits for other people's children, or taking part in a [[surrogacy]] scam, and records of her prior births were put similarly in doubt. Prosecutors called for her two children to be taken away from her.{{dubious|date=September 2017|reason= "pros'r" is a role in a criminal trial. The logically related custody matter is a civil case with different *roles*, for attys, even if the prosecuter who brought the crim case happens  to bring the civil action. (Likelihood of same atty having both roles is ruffly proportional to both pop'n and level of litigousness in that jurisdiction, but even so would not be acting in role of pros'ctor in the custody matter.)}} As time came for her to give birth to her third child, the judge ordered that an observer be present at the birth, ensure that blood samples were immediately taken from both the child and Fairchild, and be available to testify. Two weeks later, DNA tests seemed to indicate that she was also not the mother of that child.

A breakthrough came when a lawyer for the prosecution{{cn|date= September 2017|reason = this might have been involved only in the civil matter, since this editor demonstrated ignorance or neglect of the distinction}} knew of  [[Karen Keegan]], a [[Chimera (genetics)|chimeric]] woman in Boston, and suggested the similar possibility to Fairchild's lawyer, Alan Tindell, who then introduced an article in the ''[[The New England Journal of Medicine|New England Journal of Medicine]]'' about Keegan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1056/NEJMoa013452|last=Yu|first=Neng|date=16 May 2002|title=Disputed Maternity Leading to Identification of Tetragametic Chimerism|journal=New England Journal of Medicine|volume=346|issue=20|pages=1545–1552|pmid=12015394|url=http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa013452|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rowlands|first=Letitia|title=When your unborn twin is your children's mother|url=http://www.essentialbaby.com.au/life-style/nutrition-and-wellbeing/when-your-unborn-twin-is-your-childrens-mother-20140203-31woi.html|publisher=Essential Baby|accessdate=26 February 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140301211020/http://www.essentialbaby.com.au/life-style/nutrition-and-wellbeing/when-your-unborn-twin-is-your-childrens-mother-20140203-31woi.html|archivedate=1 March 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He realised that Fairchild's case might also be caused by [[chimera (genetics)|chimerism]]. As in Keegan's case, DNA samples were taken  from members of the extended family. The DNA of Fairchild's children matched that of Fairchild's mother to the extent expected of a grandmother. They also found that, although the DNA in Fairchild's skin and hair did not match her children's, the DNA from a [[Pap test|cervical smear]] test did match. Fairchild was carrying two different sets of DNA, the defining characteristic of chimerism.&lt;!-- Chimerism is a largely insignificant medical anomoly. A "chimera" is a superstitious fantasy of the ancient, biologically benighted, Greek shitkickers (and even of their wisest shitkicker pre-scientists), making failure to clearly distinguish between the condition and a person exhibiting it a crime against humanity. --&gt;

Retrieved 29 May 2013. [https://www.webcitation.org/6GzCKzVwQ?url=http://www.namuseum.gr/collections/sculpture/classical/classic19-en.html Archived here].&lt;/ref&gt; The Museum suggests that the subject is the winner of an athletic competition. With its soft musculature and exaggerated ''[[contrapposto]]'', its style is associated with the school of [[Praxiteles]]. The upraised arm and the distribution of weight indicate that in his original context, this ''[[ephebos|ephebe]]'' was leaning against a vertical support, such as a column.&lt;ref&gt;The unusual stance was noted by Gisela Richter, "The Hermes of Praxiteles" ''American Journal of Archaeology'' '''35'''.3 (July - September 1931:277-290) p. 280, crediting W. Wrede, in ''Arch. Anz.'' 1926:401 with the observation.&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Other underwater finds==
Before the advent of [[scuba diving]], its chance recovery suggested the possibility that artistic as well as archaeological treasures had been preserved from human destruction in underwater sites. Other well-known underwater bronze finds have been retrieved, generally from [[shipwreck]] sites, in the Aegean and Mediterranean: the [[Antikythera mechanism]], the ''[[Antikythera Ephebe]]'' and the portrait head of a [[Stoicism|Stoic]] discovered by sponge-divers in 1900, the [[Mahdia shipwreck]] off the coast of Tunisia, 1907; the standing ''[[Poseidon of Cape Artemision]]'' found off Cape Artemision in northern Euboea, 1926; the ''horse'' and ''Rider'' found off Cape Artemision, 1928 and 1937; the ''[[Getty Victorious Youth]]'' dredged up off the coast of Fano, Italy; the [[Riace bronzes]], found in 1972; the [[Dancing Satyr of Mazara del Vallo]], in the Sicily Channel, 2003;  and the ''[[Apoxyomenos]]''  recovered from the sea off the Croatian island of [[Lošinj]] in 1999.

'''Mattole''', or '''Mattole–Bear River''', is an [[language death|extinct]] [[Athabaskan languages|Athabaskan language]] once spoken by the [[Mattole]] and [[Bear River Indians (California)|Bear River]] peoples of northern California. It is one of the four languages belonging to the ''California Athabaskan'' cluster of the [[Pacific Coast Athabaskan languages]]. It was found in two locations: in the valley of the [[Mattole River]], immediately south of  [[Cape Mendocino]] on the coast of northwest California, and a distinct dialect on Bear River, about 10 miles to the north.

'''''Nova revija''''' ([[Slovene language|Slovene]] for ''New Review'' or ''New Journal'') is a Slovene language [[literary magazine]] published in [[Slovenia]].

==History and profile==
''Nova revija'' was founded by Cankarjeva Publishing House in 1982,&lt;ref name=nrin&gt;{{cite web|title=Nova revija Institute|url=http://www.culture.si/en/Nova_revija_Institute|publisher=Culture|accessdate=6 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; when the [[Titoist]] regime allowed a group of liberal and conservative critical intellectuals to publish an editorially entirely independent journal&lt;ref name=mb&gt;{{cite journal|author=Michael Biggins|title=Publishing in Slovenia|journal=Slavic &amp; East European Information Resources|date=2001|volume=1|issue=2-3|doi=10.1300/J167v01n02_01|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1300/J167v01n02_01|accessdate=8 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; for the first time after the abolishment of the magazine ''[[Perspektive]]'' in 1964. The owner and publisher of the magazine is Nova revija Publishing House.&lt;ref name=nrin/&gt;

Already in 1980, shortly after the death of the Yugoslav president [[Josip Broz Tito]], six Slovenian authors and intellectuals (columnist [[Dimitrij Rupel]], philosopher [[Tine Hribar]], poets [[Niko Grafenauer]], [[Svetlana Makarovič]] and [[Boris A. Novak]], and literary historian [[Andrej Inkret]]) submitted a petition to the authorities of the [[Socialist Republic of Slovenia]] in which they demanded to be allowed to publish a new independent journal. The petition maintained that the alternative magazine ''[[Problemi]]'', which had served as the main critical publication in Slovenia since the mid-1960s, had been taken over by the [[Ljubljana Lacanian school]], and that a new journal was needed. The petition was signed by over 60 public figures from Slovenia, which published a support letter in the daily magazine ''[[Delo]]''. It took however two years before the journal was allowed to be published. The first issue appeared in 1982, under the simple name of ''Nova revija'', meaning ''New Journal'' or ''New Review''. The publishing board included intellectuals from different generations and different ideological positions. Their common feature was a critical stance towards the [[Communist regime]], from a western perspective: either [[Liberalism|liberal]], [[Conservativism|conservative]], [[Christian democratic]], or [[Social democratic]].

In the mid-1980s, ''Nova revija'' became one of the chief voices of dissent in Slovenia, together with the [[left liberal]] popular magazine ''[[Mladina]]''.

In 1987, the 57th issue of ''Nova revija'' was published, which included the [[Contributions to the Slovenian National Program]], a plea for a democratic and sovereign Slovenia.&lt;ref name=nrin/&gt;&lt;ref name=mb/&gt; In 1989, the intellectual group around the journal established the [[Slovenian Democratic Union]], which soon emerged as one of the key political parties within the [[DEMOS coalition]], a broad coalition that won the first free elections to the [[National Assembly (Slovenia)|National Assembly of Slovenia]] in April 1990.

In the 1980s ''Nova revija'' had a circulation of 3,500 copies.&lt;ref name=mb/&gt; Its circulation dropped to 1,500 copies in the 1990s.&lt;ref name=mb/&gt;

After the independence of Slovenia in 1991, the magazine expanded into one of the most important cultural institutions in Slovenia.

==Contributors==
Prominent authors, essayists, columnists, and thinkers have contributed to ''Nova revija'', among them sociologists [[Jože Pučnik]], [[Igor Škamperle]], [[Gregor Tomc]], [[Aleš Debeljak]] and [[Frane Adam]]; political analysts [[Viktor Blažič]] and [[Dimitrij Rupel]]; essayists [[Žarko Petan]], [[Brane Senegačnik]], [[Alenka Puhar]], [[Spomenka Hribar]], [[Andrej Capuder]] and [[Igor Senčar]]; poets [[Veno Taufer]], [[Niko Grafenauer]], [[Aleš Šteger]], [[Jože Snoj]], [[Boris A. Novak]], [[Josip Osti]], [[Dane Zajc]], and [[Tomaž Šalamun]]; philosophers [[Tine Hribar]], [[Ivo Urbančič]] and [[Dean Komel]]; legal experts [[France Bučar]] and [[Peter Jambrek]]; writers [[Rudi Šeligo]], [[Lojze Kovačič]], [[Alojz Rebula]], [[Drago Jančar]], and [[Boris Pahor]]; literary critics [[Taras Kermauner]], [[Janko Kos]] and [[Simona Škrabec]]; historians [[Vasko Simoniti]], [[Peter Vodopivec]], [[Peter Štih]], [[Igor Grdina]], and [[Jože Pirjevec]] and many others.

Western authors and columnist who have contributed to the magazine include [[Jacques Rupnik]], [[Thomas Luckmann]], [[Gianni Vattimo]], and [[Fernando Savater]].

The journal has published translations of foreign literates such as [[Naguib Mahfouz]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Barbara Skubic|title=Translations from Arabic in Slovenia, 1990-2010|url=http://www.npage.org/IMG/pdf/Arabic-Slovene-corr.pdf|publisher=Next Page Foundation|accessdate=6 December 2014|date=November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Zbigniew Herbert]], [[Wyslawa Szymborska]], [[Peter Handke]], [[Diego Marani]], and [[Czeslaw Milosz]], as well as theorists like [[Jan Patočka]], [[Hannah Arendt]], [[Charles Taylor (philosopher)|Charles Taylor]], [[Jacques Derrida]], [[François Furet]], [[Francis Fukuyama]], [[Jürgen Habermas]], [[Niklas Luhmann]], and [[Peter Szondi]].

'''Ordubad''' (also, '''Ordoubat''' and '''Ordubat''') is the second largest town and a municipality of the [[Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic]] of [[Azerbaijan]] and is one of its three regions. It is the capital of the ''rayon'' [[Ordubad District]]. Ordubad is a medieval city of the [[Caucasus]] and in its current capacity of a town was founded in the 18th century. The town is divided into five districts: the Ambaras, the Kurdtatal, the Mingis, the Sar sheher, and the Uch. Ordubad is known as the “pearl” of [[Nakhichevan Khanate|Nakhchevan province]] and is well known for its exports of fruits and spices, and for its cuisine.

==Etymology==
Ordubad is a name of Turco-Persian origin and means "''army town''" (from Turkic ordu (army) and Persian [[-abad|bad]] (town)), which implies that the city was founded during the period of the [[Mongol Empire|Mongol]] or the ensuing [[Il-Khanid]] rule.&lt;ref name="Iranica"/&gt; [[Hamdallah Mustawfi]] (1281–1349) mentions Ordubad in the mid-14th century as "a provincial town, one of the five towns making up the ''tumān'' of Nakhchivan, with fine gardens, and producing good grapes, corn and cotton".&lt;ref name="Iranica"/&gt;

French traveller Jean Saint-Martin mentions, in his 1818 book about the geography of Armenia, that the contemporary people referred to the city as ''Ordouvar'' ({{Lang-hy|Որդուվար}}) or ''Ourdovar'' ({{Lang-hy|Ուրդովար}}) in [[Armenian language|Armenian]], and ''Ardoubad'' in [[Turkish language|Turkish]] and [[Persian language|Persian]], and that the settlement had already existed in the 14th century.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Mémoires historiques et géographiques sur l’Arménie|last=Saint-Martin|first=Jean|publisher=L'imprimerie Royale|year=1818|isbn=|location=Paris|pages=134|quote=Original text in French:
"Որդուվար Ortouvar, ou Ուրդովար Ourtovar, en turc et en persan Ardoubad, grand bourg à l'extrémité orientale du pays de Koghthen, au nord de l'Araxes, sur une petite rivière qui vient des montagnes de Gaban et se jette dans ce fleuve. Ce bourg existoit déjà au quatorzième siècle."; English translation: "Որդուվար Ortouvar, ou Ուրդովար Ourtovar, in Turkish and Persian Ardoubad, big town at the eastern extremity of the country of Koghthen, in the north of the Araxes, on a little river that comes from the mountains of Gaban and that empties in this river. This town existed already in the fourteenth century."}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Location==
The Ordubad city, known as the “pearl” of [[Nakhichevan Khanate|Nakhchevan province]],{{Sfn|Rustamkhanli|2013|p=175}} is located at an elevation of {{Convert|949|m}}. It is in the northern bank of the central stretch of the [[Aras (river)|Araxes]] (Aras) river of the eastern [[Transcaucasia]] which earlier belonged to [[Persia]], now in Azerbaijan. the second largest town.&lt;ref name="Iranica"&gt;{{cite web|title=Ordubād|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/ordubad|accessdate=21 November 2015|publisher=Encyclopaedia Iranica}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;USSR: Administrative Territorial Division of the Union Republics, Moscow, 1977&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Ordubad Province]] itself has an area of {{Convert|972|km2}} and is delimited by Iran on the south, Armenia forming the north and west border, and the Julfa region of Nakhchivan bordering the east.&lt;ref name=Foreign/&gt; The river that rises from the north from the [[Mt. Qobān]] (also known as Tk. Qapïjïq, Rus. Kapudzhukh or Kapydzhik) at an elevation of {{Convert|3904| m}} drains into the [[Araxes]].&lt;ref name="Iranica"/&gt; The town is divided into five districts of the Ambaras, the Kurdtatal, the Mingis, the Sar sheher, and the Uch.&lt;ref name=Heritage&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/1575/|title=Ordubad historical and architectural reserve|accessdate=19 November 2015|publisher=UNESCO Organization}}&lt;/ref&gt; The city has a large number of walnut and mulberry trees.{{Sfn|Sayyāḥ|1999|p=281}} The closest railway station is Ordubad and the distance to [[Nakhchivan (city)|Nakhchivan]] city is {{Convert|88|km}}. [[Tabriz]] is {{Convert|94|km}} away to the north-northwest.&lt;ref name="Iranica"/&gt;

In 1999 the population of the city was reported as 5,000. Most of the population belonged to the [[Shiite Muslim]] sect with Armenians and Russians forming a minority.{{Sfn|Sayyāḥ|1999|p=281}}

==History==
[[File:Ordubad serseher seseri meydani svln4821 historical.jpg|left|thumb|sarshahar square]]
The city may have been established by the 14th century, or earlier.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The [[Ottoman Empire]] (1299–1923) had occupied the Ordubad territory in the past. Before this occupation, a local rebellion had been organized against invasion of the Ottomans by Hadji, known as “Kasab” (butcher) and Bayandar when they came to know that [[Saffavids]] were to launch an attack. They were backed by the local people. The rebels initially took control of the city and also occupied a fortress near the city. However, the rebels had their own internal dissensions, and as a result a small battalion of the Ottoman army defeated the rebels and killed them. Following this victory and occupation by the Ottomans, Khaten bey Ordubadi, the prime [[vizier]], appealed to the Shah to waive off all taxes levied on the local people, which was agreed.{{Sfn|Zardabli|2014|p=318}}

Ordubad was once an important regional stop on the caravan route of the [[Silk Road]] trade with China, Europe and India. The city was first founded as Gala city, a feudal city,  on the top of the Ambras on the left bank of [[Ordubadchay River]] in the 15th century. In view of extensive trade, the city started developing on the right bank of the Ordubadchay with many new districts. In the 17th and 18th centuries trade centres were established in the city on the right bank, which diminished the importance of Gala city. Built in the backdrop of [[Zangezur Mountains|Zangezur Caucasus mountain]] it is enclosed on three sides by mountains providing for a very green environment. In the 17th century the city underwent major reconstruction activity, maintaining eastern feudal architectural features.&lt;ref name=Heritage/&gt; Following the [[Russo-Persian War (1826-1828)]], the town passed from [[Qajar dynasty|Iranian]] rule to [[Imperial Russia]]n rule under the [[Treaty of Turkmenchay]] of 1828. According to a census conducted in 1834, Ordubad, with its 52 villages, had a population of 11,341 constituting of [[Muslims]] and [[Armenians]].&lt;ref name="Iranica"/&gt;

The Ordubad site was added to the [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage]] Tentative List on 24 October 2001 in the Cultural category under Criteria (i), (iv) and (v).&lt;ref name=Heritage/&gt;

===Archaeological excavations===
Archaeological excavations carried out by Russian archaeologists in ancient settlements of Ordubad have unearthed remnants of [[Bronze age]] dated to the fourth century.{{Sfn|Mayor|2014|p=73}} It includes a [[necropolis]], which revealed graves of warriors also dated to the fourth century. These were initially assessed, in 1928, as skeletons of only warrior men but subsequent research carried out by the Archaeological and Ethnological Institute of Azerbaijan National Academy of Science in 2004 has concluded that at least one of the skeletons is of a woman warrior found with her armory such as quiver, arrows and helmet.{{Sfn|Mayor|2014|p=73}}

==Economy==
Ordubad economy is dependent on trading particularly of fruits, wheat, and silk;  grapes are of 40 varieties. The silk exports have been mostly to [[Venice]], [[Marseille]], [[Amsterdam]] and many other places in Europe, from the middle of the 16th century. During the early years of the 20th century the Ordubad silk received 13 gold medals in the international exhibitions and fairs.&lt;ref name=Foreign/&gt;{{Sfn|Rustamkhanli|2013|p=175}} [[Arak (drink)|Arak]] is also an export commodity of the city.{{Sfn|Sayyāḥ|1999|p=281}} Economic activity in Ordubad and near by regions includes copper mining, Paragachayskoe [[molybdenum]] deposit from the Meghri-Ordubad gratoidnym [[batholiths]], [[bauxite]], [[tungsten]] and [[tin]] ore.{{Sfn|Publications|2007|p=73}}

[[File:Ordubad 2014-02-11 23-35.jpg|right|thumb|A view of Ordubad]]
In the new city of Ordubad, planned in the 17th century, there were five divisions or districts with trade squares of larger size than the earlier blocks, which also had a plethora of mosques, springs, and bath-houses. The medieval market square in the heart of the city is prominent and the glass mosque, the Cümə Mosque, is a landmark. Caravan sheds and the market here traded in silk and dry fruits with East European countries. The lay out of the streets is radial and appears in the shape of a fan close to the center of the city. Each of the streets have squares which are a typical feature of the city.&lt;ref name=Heritage/&gt; A well known suburb of the city is Akulis through which a small stream flows. The city has many private and public schools.{{Sfn|Sayyāḥ|1999|p=281}} The city has a number [[qanats]] or underground canals called "kahriz", which are the source of water for houses and orchards.&lt;ref name=Planet&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lonelyplanet.com/azerbaijan/ordubad|title=Introducing Ordubad|accessdate=21 November 2015|publisher=Lonely Planet}}&lt;/ref&gt; The city reflects tradition and culture of northern and southern Azerbaijan.{{Sfn|Rustamkhanli|2013|p=175}}

=== Museums ===
There are three museums in Ordubad. 
* Memorial Museum of Mammad Said Ordubadi - established in 1972, holds more than 700 exhibits.
* The House-Museum of Academician Yusif Mammadaliyev - established in 1975, holds more than 1800 exhibits.
* Ordubad History Museum - established in December 1980, holds nearly 3500 exhibits and fragments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.world66.com/europe/azerbaijan/naxcivan/ordubad/museums/ordubad_history_mu|title=Ordubad History Museum|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=1 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Juma Mosque===
Juma Mosque, in the heart of the city, was initially built as the office of Hatambek Ordubadi vizier of Shah Abbas, in the 17th century. Even now it looks more like a palace. The history museum, located on the opposite side, is a domed structure that is dated to the 18th century which in the past was used as a silk shop, restaurant and ''zurkhaneh'' ("house of strength"). Soviet era photos are exhibited here. The porch here was once decorated with statues of Russian communists and the roof was also designed in Russian architecture, and these have since been removed.  {{Sfn|Noble|Kohn|Systermans|2008|p=293-94}}

===Gemigaya Mountain===
Gemigaya Mountain is an important backdrop to the city which is known for its [[petroglyph]]s, necropolises, and ancient settlements of Ordubad, Sabirkend, Plovdagh and Kharaba Gilan, which attests to its occupancy between 7th to 1st century BC.&lt;ref name=Foreign/&gt; It is situated within the [[Ordubad National Park]].&lt;ref name=Planet/&gt;

===Observatory===
In the Astronomical Observatory at Ordubad, Nakhichevan ASSR and also at the Tarija, Bolivia, with the help of expedition [[astrograph]], 6,000 plates were recorded from 1983–1988 which cataloged 200,000 stars south of the [[equator]] up to the 11th magnitude.{{Sfn|McNally|2012|p=232}}

'''Our Lady of Dublin''' is a [[statue]] of the [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Virgin Mary]] on display in [[Whitefriar Street Carmelite Church]] in [[Dublin]], [[Ireland]], that represents the [[Black Madonna]] of Ireland.

== Art history perspective ==
Stylistically, the statue resembles early 16th century wooden statuary and probably dates from that period.

== History ==
Local legend with tenuous documentary support suggests that the statue originated in [[St. Mary's Abbey, Dublin|St. Mary's Abbey]] on Mary Street in Dublin which was dissolved as part of the Henrician reforms in 1539 (see: [[Dissolution of the Monasteries]]).

The first concrete historical mention dates from 1749 in a survey of the [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] Chapels of Dublin, which refers to a statue in St. Mary's Lane Parochial Chapel. The chapel was torn down in 1816 to make way for a new school and no further mention of the statue is recorded until it was found by Father John Spratt,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fr John Spratt - Beloved of Dublin's Poor|url=http://www.carmelites.ie/PDF/JohnSpratt.pdf|accessdate=22 September 2011|author=Peter O’Dwyer, O.Carm.|location=Dublin|pages=32|format=PDF|year=1971}}&lt;/ref&gt; a member of the [[Carmelite]] order, in 1824.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Shrine of Our Lady of Dublin, Whitefriar Street Church|url=http://www.carmelites.ie/ladydublin.html|accessdate=22 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The restored statue has been on display near the high altar of the church in a purpose built shrine since 1915.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Daphne Pochin Mould|authorlink=Daphne Pochin Mould|title=Whitefriar St. Church: A Short Guide|year=1964|publisher=Carmelite Publications|location=Dublin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The feast-day of Our Lady of Dublin is celebrated on 8 September.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Whitefriar Street|url=http://www.carmelites.ie/whitefriarstreet.html|accessdate=22 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ancient '''Perusia''', now [[Perugia]], first appears in history as one of the [[Etruscan league|12 confederate cities]] of [[Etruria]]. It is first mentioned in the account of the war of 310 or 309 BC between the [[Etruscans]] and the [[Roman Republic|Romans]]. It took, however, an important part in the rebellion of 295 BC and was reduced, with Vulsinii and Arretium ([[Arezzo]]), to seek for peace in the following year.&lt;ref name=EB1911&gt;{{EB1911 |wstitle=Perugia |volume=21 |pages=278–279 |inline=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It seems the city was in the Antonii's clientela since this period, as it was said by historians during imperial times.{{Or|date=August 2009}}

In 216 BC and 205 BC it assisted Rome in the [[Second Punic War|Hannibalic war]], but afterward it is not mentioned until 41–40 BC, when [[Lucius Antonius (brother of Mark Antony)|Lucius Antonius]] took refuge there and was reduced by [[Augustus|Octavian]] after a long siege.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; 
Some of the refugees ran away toward Gauls to escape Octavian. A local history said they were the founders of Perouges en [[Dauphiné]] Province (France).

A number of lead bullets used by slingers have been found in and around the city.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum|CIL]]'' xi.1212&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Keppie2002"&gt;{{cite book|author=Lawrence Keppie|title=The Making of the Roman Army: From Republic to Empire|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WouFAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA108|date=4 January 2002|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-134-74603-3|pages=108–}}&lt;/ref&gt; The city was burnt, we are told, with the exception of the temples of [[Vulcan (mythology)|Vulcan]] and [[Hera|Juno]] &amp;mdash; the massive Etruscan terrace-walls, naturally, can hardly have suffered at all &amp;mdash; and the town, with the territory for a mile round, was allowed to be occupied by whoever chose. It must have been rebuilt almost at once, for several bases exist, inscribed ''Augusta sacr(um) Perusia restituta''; but, as we have seen, it did not become a colony until AD 251–253.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Augusta Perusia: Rivista di topografia, arte e costume dell'Umbria|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Vw0FAAAAYAAJ|year=1908}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Numeral systems}}
[[Counting]] in [[prehistory]] was first assisted by using body parts, primarily the [[finger-counting|finger]]s. 
This is reflected in the etymology of certain [[Numeral (linguistics)|number names]], such as in the names of ''ten'' and ''hundred'' in the [[Proto-Indo-European numerals]], both containing the root *''dḱ'' also seen in the word for "finger" (Latin ''digitus'', cognate to English ''toe'').

Early systems of counting using [[tally marks]] appear in the [[Upper Paleolithic]].
The first more complex systems develop in the [[Ancient Near East]] together with the development of [[Bronze Age writing|early writing]] out of [[proto-writing]] systems.

==Background==
{{Main|Tally marks}}
Numerals originally developed from the use of [[tally marks]] as a counting aid, with the oldest examples being about 35,000 to 25,000 years old.

==Development==
Counting aids like tally marks become more sophisticated in the Near Eastern [[Neolithic]], developing into various types of [[proto-writing]].
The [[Cuneiform script]] develops out of proto-writing associated with keeping track of goods during the [[Chalcolithic]].

===Old world===
*[[Egyptian numerals]]
*[[Babylonian numerals]]
*[[Aegean numerals]]

===New world===
* [[Quipu]]
* [[Maya numerals]]

==Early numerals in Unicode==
{{See|Unicode numerals}}
[[Unicode]]'s [[Supplementary Multilingual Plane]] has a number of [[code point]] ranges reserved for prehistoric or early historic numerals:
* [[Aegean Numbers]] (10100–1013F)
* [[Ancient Greek Numbers]] (10140–1018F)
* [[Cuneiform Numbers and Punctuation]] (12400–1247F)
* [[Counting Rod Numerals]] (1D360–1D37F)

{{italic title}}
'''''Pretty Little Mistakes''''' is a book written by [[Heather McElhatton]] and published on May 1, 2007 by [[HarperCollins]].

The novel is written in [[Second-person narrative]] and allows the reader to direct where the story will go, similar to the [[Choose Your Own Adventure]] book series.  The book has more than 150 possible endings.  50% of the endings are "good" and 50% are "bad".  After an introduction to the story, the reader is asked to determine the protagonist's next course of action. After the reader makes a choice, the plot branches out leading to more decisions and eventually multiple possible endings.  Endings include the death of the protagonist and/or companions of the main character.

{{Transitivity and Valency}}

A '''reciprocal''' ([[list of glossing abbreviations|abbreviated]] '''{{sc|recp}}''') is a [[Linguistics|linguistic]] structure that marks a particular kind of relationship between two noun phrases. In a reciprocal construction, each of the [[Thematic relation|participants]] occupies both the role of [[agent (grammar)|agent]] and [[patient (grammar)|patient]] with respect to the other. For example, the English sentence ''"John and Mary cut each other's hair"'', contains a reciprocal structure: John cuts Mary's hair, and Mary cuts John's.

Many languages, such as [[Semitic languages]], [[Altaic languages]] or [[Bantu languages]], have special reciprocal [[morpheme]]s in verbs. English does not, and it generally uses ''"each other"'' or some other phrase to indicate reciprocity. Latin uses ''inter'' and the [[reflexive pronoun]] of the subject of the verb: ''inter se'' (between themselves) when the verb is third-person. Most [[Indo-European languages]] do not have special markers for reciprocity on verbs, and reciprocal constructions are expressed through [[reflexive verb|reflexivity]] or other mechanisms.  For example, [[Russian language|Russian]] marks reciprocity in [[intransitive verb]]s with the suffix -ся (self), which has also reflexive and [[Passive voice|passive]] interpretations.

'''Scottish art in the nineteenth century''' is the body of [[visual art]] made in Scotland, by Scots, or about scottish subjects. This period saw the increasing professionalisation and organisation of art in Scotland. Major institutions founded in this period included the Institution for the Encouragement of the Fine Arts in Scotland, the [[Royal Scottish Academy|Royal Scottish Academy of Art]], the [[National Gallery of Scotland]], the [[Scottish National Portrait Gallery]] and the [[Royal Glasgow Institute of the Fine Arts|Glasgow Institute]]. Art education in Edinburgh focused on the [[Trustees Drawing Academy of Edinburgh]]. [[Glasgow School of Art]] was founded in 1845 and [[Grays School of Art]] in Aberdeen in 1885.

[[Henry Raeburn]], most famous for his intimate portraits of leading figures in Scottish life, was the first significant artist to pursue his entire career in Scotland. His pupils included the brothers William, Archibald and Andrew Robertson. The next generation of portrait painters included David Watson and [[John Watson Gordon]]. Significant Glasgow artists included [[John Graham-Gilbert]] and [[Daniel Macnee]]. [[David Wilkie (artist)|David Wilkie]] emerged as of one of the most influential British artists of the century in a variety of forms. [[Alexander Nasmyth]] helped formulate the tradition of Scottish landscape painting, which focused in the mid-nineteenth century on the Highlands. It was taken into the late nineteenth century by artists including [[Horatio McCulloch]], [[Joseph Farquharson]] and [[William McTaggart]]. Towards the end of the century a number of artist colonies were founded, particularly in coastal communities such as [[Pittenweem]] and [[Kirkudbright]]. Wilkie was instrumental in the development of [[genre painting]], which was pursued by artists including [[John Burnet (painter)|John Burnet]], [[Alexander George Fraser]] and [[Walter Geikie]]. He also helped inspire the interest in Spanish and oriental painting, continued by [[William Allan (painter)|William Allan]], [[David Roberts (painter)|David Roberts]] and [[John Phillip]].

Sculpture was pioneered in Scotland by [[Lawrence Macdonald]] and [[George Combe]]. [[John Steell]] was the first significant Scottish sculptor to pursue their career in Scotland, gaining attention for his ''Alexander and Bucephasus'' and his design for a statue of Sir Walter Scott incorporated into the author's memorial in Edinburgh. The tradition of Scottish sculpture was boosted by the statues made for the [[Wallace Monument]] and by the centenary of [[Robert Burns]]' death in 1896. Photography was pioneered in Scotland by [[Robert Adamson (photographer)|Robert Adamson]] and [[David Octavius Hill]]. As [[Hill &amp; Adamson]] they formed the first photographic studio in Scotland in 1843 and produced work that is among the first and finest artistic uses of photography. It was subsequently pursued by [[Thomas Annan]], [[George Washington Wilson]] and [[Clementina Hawarden]].

The beginnings of the [[Arts and Crafts]] movement in Scotland were in the stained glass revival of the 1850s, pioneered in Edinburgh by [[James Ballantine]] and in Glasgow by [[Daniel Cottier]]. The Glasgow-born designer and theorist [[Christopher Dresser]] was one of the first, and most important, independent designers, a pivotal figure in the [[Aesthetic Movement]] and a major contributor to the allied [[Anglo-Japanese]] movement. A [[Celtic Revival]], drawing on ancient myths and history to produce art in a modern idiom, was pursued by artists including [[Anna Traquair]], [[John Duncan (painter)|John Duncan]], Stewart Carmichael and George Dutch Davidson. In the late nineteenth century developments in Scottish art are associated with the Glasgow School. This was made up of loose groups including the [[Glasgow Boys]], of [[James Guthrie (artist)|James Guthrie]], [[Joseph Crawhall]], [[George Henry (painter)|George Henry]] and [[Edward Arthur Walton|E. A. Walton]], who were influenced by [[French Impressionism]] and [[Realism (art)|Realism]]. From around 1890 "The Four" or the "Spook School", was composed of acclaimed architect [[Charles Rennie Mackintosh]], [[Margaret MacDonald (artist)|Margaret MacDonald]], [[Frances MacDonald|Frances]] and [[Herbert MacNair]]. They produced a distinctive blend of influences that helped define the [[Art Nouveau]] style.

==Institutions and education==
[[File:Wfm rsa building.jpg|thumb|The [[Royal Scottish Academy]], Edinburgh]]
The Institution for the Encouragement of the Fine Arts in Scotland was founded in 1819 in Edinburgh, to provide an opportunity for artists to present their work. It came to be dominated by a small aristocratic elite and excluded artists from its committee. This led to the founding of the [[Royal Scottish Academy|Royal Scottish Academy of Art]] in 1826. The resulting competition between the two bodies eventually resulted in a de facto merger. In 1835 the now Royal Institution's building on Princess Street, Edinburgh became the Academy's home for exhibitions.&lt;ref name=MacDonald2000p90&gt;M. MacDonald, ''Scottish Art'' (London: Thames and Hudson, 2000), {{ISBN|0-500-20333-4}}, p. 90.&lt;/ref&gt; The Academy was granted a Royal Charter in 1837&lt;ref&gt;''Whitaker's Concise Almanack 2012'' (A&amp;amp;C Black, 2011), {{ISBN|1-4081-4230-9}}, p. 410.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;L. A. Rose, M. Macaroon, V. Crow, ''Frommer's Scotland'' (Hoboken, NJ: John Wiley &amp; Sons, 12th edn., 2012), {{ISBN|1-119-99276-1}}, p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt; and its members were instrumental in the foundation of the [[National Gallery of Scotland]] in Edinburgh, which opened in 1859.&lt;ref name=MacDonald2000p90/&gt; The [[Scottish National Portrait Gallery]] was founded in 1882.&lt;ref&gt;D. Porter, and D. Prince, ''Frommer's Scotland'' (John Wiley &amp; Sons, 10th edn., 2008), {{ISBN|0-470-24912-9}}, pp.&amp;nbsp;109–111.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Royal Glasgow Institute of the Fine Arts|Glasgow Institute]] was formed in 1861 to provide exhibiting opportunities in the growing city similar to those in Edinburgh. It opened its own gallery on [[Sauchiehall Street]] in 1879. It received a Royal charter in 1896 and became the Royal Glasgow Institute of the Fine Arts.&lt;ref&gt;K. Hartley, ''Scottish Art Since 1900'' (National Galleries of Scotland, 1989), p. 171.&lt;/ref&gt;

Scotland has had schools of art since the eighteenth century. The [[Trustees Drawing Academy of Edinburgh]] had been founded in Edinburgh in 1760. It became the Trustees' School of Art, and placed under auspices of the Science and Art Department in South Kensington in 1858. It was taken over by the Scottish Education Department in 1907.&lt;ref name=Potter2013pp27&gt;M. Potter, ''The Concept of the 'Master'in Art Education in Britain and Ireland 1770 to the Present'' (Aldershot: Ashgate, 2013), {{ISBN|1409435555}}, p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Glasgow School of Art]] grew from the city's School of Design, founded in 1845. [[Grays School of Art]] in Aberdeen was founded in 1885.&lt;ref&gt;D. Arnold and D. P. Corbett, [https://books.google.com/books?id=QEsrlW8kH68C&amp;pg=PT296&amp;dq=scotland+schools+of+art&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=gqdiUaO6IKbP0QWSqIDABg&amp;ved=0CDUQ6AEwADgy ''A Companion to British Art: 1600 to the Present''] (Oxford: John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2013), {{ISBN|1-118-31377-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Portraiture==

[[File:Principle Lee.jpg|thumb|left|upright|John Lee (1779–1859) by [[John Watson Gordon]]]]
[[Henry Raeburn]] (1756–1823) was the first significant artist to pursue his entire career in Scotland. Born in Edinburgh and returning there after a trip to Italy in 1786, he is most famous for his intimate portraits of leading figures in Scottish life, going beyond the aristocracy to lawyers, doctors, professors, writers and ministers,&lt;ref name=Campbell2003pp142-3/&gt; adding elements of Romanticism to the [[Grand Manner]] tradition of [[Joshua Reynolds]].&lt;ref&gt;C. C. Ochterbeck, ed., ''Michelin Green Guide: Great Britain Edition'' (London: Michelin, 5th edn., 2007), {{ISBN|1-906261-08-3}}, p. 84.&lt;/ref&gt; He became a knight in 1822 and the King's [[painter and limner]] in 1823, marking a return to the post being associated with the production of art.&lt;ref name=Campbell2003pp142-3&gt;D. Campbell, ''Edinburgh: A Cultural and Literary History'' (Oxford: Signal Books, 2003), {{ISBN|1-902669-73-8}}, pp.&amp;nbsp;142–3.&lt;/ref&gt; His pupils included the brothers [[Alexander Robertson (artist)|William (Alexander)]] (1772–1841), [[Archibald Robertson (painter)|Archibald]] (1765–1835) and Andrew Robertson (1777–1845). William and Archibald went on to found the [[Columbian Academy of Painting]] in New York, and Andrew to be the leading Scottish [[Portrait miniature|miniaturist]] of his day. Also associated with Radeburn towards the end of his career were [[John Syme]] (1795–1861) and [[Colvin Smith]] (1795–1875).&lt;ref&gt;D. Macmillan, ''Scottish Art 1460–1990'' (Mainstream, 1990), {{ISBN|1-85158-251-7}}, pp. 151 and 162.&lt;/ref&gt;

Of the generation of painters that followed Raeburn, David Watson (1767–1837) trained with Reynolds in London before returning home to become the first president of the Scottish Academy in 1826.&lt;ref name=MacDonald2000pp75-6&gt;MacDonald, ''Scottish Art'', pp.&amp;nbsp;75–6.&lt;/ref&gt; The influence of both Reynolds and Raeburn can be seen in his work, including ''A Girl Drawing'' (1813) and the large group portrait ''The Children of the Earl of Elgin with their Nurse'' (c. 1805).&lt;ref&gt;Macmillan, ''Scottish Art'', p. 162.&lt;/ref&gt; He was followed as president of the academy by his nephew [[John Watson Gordon]] (1788–1864), who also studied with Raeburn. He painted portraits of leading cultural figures [[James Hogg]] and [[Carolina Nairne|Lady Nairne]] as part of a series of portraits commissioned by [[William Blackwood]]. From the 1840s his work began to be influenced by early photography, with cool light and muted colours, as can be seen in his full-length portrait of ''Principal Lee'' (1847).&lt;ref&gt;Macmillan, ''Scottish Art'', p. 163.&lt;/ref&gt;

John Graham-Gilbert (1794–1866) was born in Glasgow and worked in the city from 1834, playing an important part in the professionalisation of painting there. Other figures to pursue their careers largely in portraiture and based in Glasgow included [[Daniel Macnee]] (1806–82). He moved to Edinburgh after his election of President of the Academy in 1876. Other major figures who worked in portraiture included [[Francis Grant (artist)|Francis Grant]], who became the first Scottish president of the Royal Academy in London, [[Robert Scott Lauder]] (1803–69), [[William Quiller Orchardson]] (1832–1910) and [[John Pettie]] (1839–93).&lt;ref&gt;Macmillan, ''Scottish Art'', pp.&amp;nbsp;163–4.&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Zephaniah Bell]] (1794–1883) was educated in London and was a forerunner of the trend of Parisian education that would become common among Scottish artists of the later nineteenth century.&lt;ref name=MacDonald2000pp75-6/&gt; [[Andrew Geddes (artist)|Andrew Geddes]] (1783–1844) produced some landscapes, but also portraits before he finally moved to London in 1831.&lt;ref&gt;R. N. Wornum and C. L. Eastlake, ''Descriptive and Historical Catalogue of the Pictures in the National Gallery ... British School ... Temporarily exhibited at South Kensington'' (London: National Gallery, 12th edn., 1864), p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt; [[David Wilkie (artist)|David Wilkie]] (1785–1841) worked mainly in London, and produced the flattering painting of the [[George IV of the United Kingdom|King George IV]] in Highland dress commemorating the royal visit to Scotland in 1823 that set off the international fashion for the kilt. He succeeded Raeburn as Royal Limner in 1823 and would emerge of one of the most influential British artists of the century.&lt;ref name=Chilvers2009pp678-9&gt;I.

==Landscape painting==

[[File:Nasmyth Alexander Highland Loch.jpg|thumb|right|Highland Loch Landscape by [[Alexander Nasmyth]] (date unknown)]]
[[Alexander Nasmyth]] (1758–1840) visited Italy and worked in London, but returned to his native Edinburgh for most of his career. He produced work in a large range of forms, including his portrait of Romantic poet Robert Burns, which depicts him against a dramatic Scottish background, but he is chiefly remembered for his landscapes and is described in the ''Oxford Dictionary of Art'' as "the founder of the Scottish landscape tradition".&lt;ref name=Chilvers2009p433&gt;Chilvers, ''The Oxford Dictionary of Art and Artists'', p. 433.&lt;/ref&gt; The work of John Knox (1778–1845) continued the theme of landscape, directly linking it with the Romantic works of [[Walter Scott]]&lt;ref&gt;R. J. Hill, ''Picturing Scotland Through the Waverley Novels: Walter Scott and the Origins of the Victorian Illustrated Novel'' (Aldershot: Ashgate, 2010), {{ISBN|0-7546-6806-1}}, p. 104.&lt;/ref&gt; and he was also among the first artists to take a major interest in depicting the urban landscape of Glasgow.&lt;ref&gt;D. Kemp, ''The Pleasures and Treasures of Britain: A Discerning Traveller's Companion'' (Toronto: Dundurn, 1992), {{ISBN|1-55002-159-1}}, p. 401.&lt;/ref&gt; The tradition of Highland landscape painting was continued by figures such as [[Horatio McCulloch]] (1806–67), [[Joseph Farquharson]] (1846–1935) and [[William McTaggart]] (1835–1910).&lt;ref name=Szasz200p136&gt;F. M. Szasz, ''Scots in the North American West, 1790–1917'' (Norman, OK: University of Oklahoma Press, 2000), {{ISBN|0-8061-3253-1}}, p. 136.&lt;/ref&gt; McCulloch's images of places including [[Glen Coe]] and [[Loch Lomond]] and the [[Trossachs]], became parlour room panoramas that helped to define popular images of Scotland. This was helped by the Queen's declared affection for Scotland, signified by her adoption of [[Balmoral Castle|Balmoral]] as a royal retreat. In this period a Scottish "grand tour" developed with large number of English artists, including [[J. M. W. Turner|Turner]], flocking to the Highlands to paint and draw.&lt;ref name=Billcliffe2009p27&gt;R. Billcliffe, ''The Glasgow Boys'' (London: Frances Lincoln, 2009), {{ISBN|0-7112-2906-6}}, p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt; From the 1870s Farquharson was a major figure in interpreting Scottish landscapes, specialising in snowscapes and sheep, and using a mobile heated studio in order to capture the conditions from life.&lt;ref name=Szasz200p136/&gt; In the same period McTaggart emerged as the leading Scottish landscape painter, he has been compared with [[John Constable]] and described as the "Scottish Impressionist", with free brushwork often depicting stormy seas and moving clouds.&lt;ref name=Chilvers2009p376&gt;Chilvers, ''The Oxford Dictionary of Art and Artists'', p. 376.&lt;/ref&gt; The fashion for coastal painting in the later nineteenth century led to the establishment of artist colonies in places such as [[Pittenweem]] and [[Crail]] in Fife,&lt;ref&gt;P. Howard, ''Landscapes: the Artists' Vision'' (London: Taylor &amp; Francis, 1991), {{ISBN|0-415-00775-5}}, p. 116.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cockburnspath]] in the Borders, [[Cambuskenneth]] near Stirling on the River Forth&lt;ref&gt;N.

[[File:Blind Fiddler (1806) by David Wilkie.jpg|thumb|left|''The Blind Fiddler'' by [[David Wilkie (artist)|David Wilkie]] (1806)]]
David Wilkie became the key figure in the development of British genre art. After a tour of Europe Wilkie he was increasingly influenced by [[Renaissance art|Renaissance]] and [[Baroque art|Baroque painting]]. He became most famous for his anecdotal paintings of Scottish and English life.&lt;ref name=Macdonald2000pp84-7&gt;MacDonald, ''Scottish Art'', pp.&amp;nbsp;84–7.&lt;/ref&gt; His work on themes of Scottish everyday life included ''Village Politicians'' (1806), ''The Blind Fiddler'' (1806), ''Distraining for Rent'' (1815) and ''The Penny Wedding'' (1818). His most famous work was ''[[The Chelsea Pensioners reading the Waterloo Dispatch]]'', one of the most popular exhibitions in London in 1822.&lt;ref name=Chilvers2009pp678-9/&gt; His sketch ''Knox preaching before the Lords of the Congregation'' (1822), dealt with the historic themes that would become a major part of Scottish painting in the second half of the century and he would also be a major influence on oriental painting. Scottish painters influenced by Wilkie included [[John Burnet (painter)|John Burnet]] (1784–1868), [[Alexander George Fraser]] (1785–1865) and [[Walter Geikie]] (1795–1837). A younger generation that took genre painting into the late nineteenth century included [[Erskine Nicol]] (1825–1904) and the brothers [[John Faed|John]] (1818–1902) and [[Thomas Faed]] (1826–1900).&lt;ref name=Macdonald2000pp84-7/&gt; Major themes included the [[Scottish Reformation|Reformation]], particularly scenes involving John Knox and Mary Queen of Scots, the Covenanters, especially the "[[The Killing Time|Killing Time]]" of the 1680s, and the Jacobites.&lt;ref name=Macdonald2000pp96-7&gt;MacDonald, ''Scottish Art'', pp.&amp;nbsp;96–7.&lt;/ref&gt;

The expedition to Egypt led by [[Napoleon]] in 1798 began the European trend for Orientalism.&lt;ref&gt;J. MacKenzie, ''Orientalism: History, Theory and the Arts'' (Manchester: Manchester University Press, 1995), {{ISBN|0-7190-4578-9}}, p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt; For British artists the [[Napoleonic Wars|Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars]] (1793–1815) disrupted the established routes to Rome, while military expeditions to the Middle East and Spain created new areas of interest. [[William Allan (painter)|William Allan]] (1782–1850) travelled in Russia and Turkey from 1805 to 1822 and painted pictures of Russians and Turkish life. He travelled again to Turkey in the 1830s, which resulted in the production of works including ''The Slave Market: Constantinople'' (1838).&lt;ref name=Macdonald2000p93-4&gt;MacDonald, ''Scottish Art'', pp.&amp;nbsp;93–4.&lt;/ref&gt; David Wilkie also visited the Middle East in search of authentic settings and decor for Biblical paintings.&lt;ref&gt;N. Tromans and R. Kabbani, ''The Lure of the East, British Orientalist Painting'' (London: Tate Publishing, 2008), {{ISBN|0-300-13898-9}}, pp.&amp;nbsp;162–65.&lt;/ref&gt; [[David Roberts (painter)|David Roberts]] (1796–1864) became known for his prolific series of detailed [[lithograph]] prints of Egypt and the Near East that he produced during the 1840s from sketches he made during long tours of the region.&lt;ref&gt;C. Williams, "The visual image of nineteenth-century Cairo", in thabet abdullah and M.

He became known as "Spanish Philip" from his scenes of Spanish life, such as ''La Gloria: a Spanish Wake'' (1864).&lt;ref name=Macdonald2000p93-4/&gt;

==Sculpture==

[[File:Wallace Monument (8038773095).jpg|thumb|upright|David Watson Stevenson's statue of [[William Wallace]] on the exterior of the [[Wallace Monument]]]]
While opportunities and training for painters had made advances by the beginning of the nineteenth century, a Scottish tradition of sculpture was slower to emerge. In the early decades of the century commissions continued to be given to English artists, including [[Samuel Joseph (sculptor)|Samuel Joseph]] (1791–1850), who was working in Edinburgh in 1821–29 and was a founding member of the Scottish Academy. Thomas Campbell (c. 1790–1858) studied in London and settled in Rome, where he received commissions from visiting British subjects before returning to London in 1830. His works in Scotland included the Hopetoun Memorial (1824–34) in Edinburgh. [[Lawrence Macdonald]] (1799–1878) was able to study at the Trustees Academy in Edinburgh and then Rome. He returned to Edinburgh from 1827, but moved back to Rome in 1832, where he worked for the rest of his life. His most significant works included his busts of [[Sir David Baird, 1st Baronet|General David Baird]] and of the [[phrenology|phrenologist]] [[George Combe]] (c. 1830).&lt;ref&gt;MacDonald, ''Scottish Art'', pp.&amp;nbsp;90–1.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first significant Scottish sculptor to pursue their career in Scotland was [[John Steell]] (1804–91). He trained at the Trustee's Academy and in Rome and was elected to the Scottish Academy in 1830 while still in his twenties. His first work to gain significant public attention was his ''Alexander and Bucephasus''. His 1832 design for a statue of Sir Water Scott was incorporated into the author's memorial in Edinburgh. It marked the beginnings of a national school of sculpture based around major figures from Scottish culture and Scottish and British history. The tradition of Scottish sculpture was taken forward by artists such as [[Patric Park]] (1811–55), [[Alexander Handyside Ritchie]] (1804–70) and [[William Calder Marshall]] (1813–94). This reached fruition in the next generation of sculptors including [[William Brodie (sculptor)|William Brodie]] (1815–81), Amelia Hill (1820–1904) and Steell's apprentice David Watson Stevenson (1842–1904). Stevenson contributed the statue of [[William Wallace]] on the exterior of the [[Wallace Monument]] and many of the busts in the gallery of heroes inside, which included [[Robert the Bruce]], [[John Knox]], Walter Scott, [[Robert Burns]], [[James Watt]] and [[Thomas Carlyle]]. Public sculpture was boosted by the centenary of Burns' death in 1896. Stevenson produced a statue of the poet in Leith. Hill produced one for Dumfries. John Steell produced a statue for [[Central Park]] in New York, versions of which were made for Dundee, London and Dunedin. Statues of Burns and Scott were produced in areas of Scottish settlement, particularly in North America and Australia.&lt;ref&gt;MacDonald, ''Scottish Art'', pp.&amp;nbsp;125–7.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Photography==

[[File:His Faither’s Breeks.jpg|left|thumb|upright|''His Faither's Breeks'', by [[Hill &amp; Adamson]] (1843–47)]]
According to photo historian David Burn "there is a good case to be made for the proposition that the greatest contribution that Scotland has made to the visual arts, possibly to the arts as a whole, is in the art of photography".&lt;ref name=Burn2011&gt;D. Burn, "Photography", in M. Lynch, ed., ''Oxford Companion to Scottish History'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2011), {{ISBN|0-19-969305-6}}, pp.&amp;nbsp;476–7.&lt;/ref&gt; In the early nineteenth century Scottish scientists [[James Clerk Maxwell]] and [[David Brewster]] played a major part in the development of the techniques of photography. Pioneering photographers included chemist [[Robert Adamson (photographer)|Robert Adamson]] (1821–48) and artist [[David Octavius Hill]] (1821–48), who as [[Hill &amp; Adamson]] formed the first photographic studio in Scotland at Rock House in Edinburgh in 1843. Their output of around 3,000 [[calotype]] images in four years are considered some of the first and finest artistic uses of photography.&lt;ref name=Burn2011/&gt; 

Adamson trained Thomas Roger (1833–88) of St. Andrews, who was one of the first commercial photographers and beside commercial portraits, produced many genre style compositions.&lt;ref&gt;R.

==Influence of the Nazarenes and Pre-Raphaelites==
{{Main|Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood}}
Scottish artists of the mid-nineteenth century were influenced by the painters of the [[Nazarene movement]], a group of German artists based in Rome, who attempted to revive the spirituality of Medieval and Early Renaissance art. They were also influenced by, and influenced, the work of the English Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood, who rejected the formalism of [[Mannerism|Mannerist]] painting after [[Raphael]]. [[David Scott (painter)|David Scott]]'s (1806–49) learnt the art of [[fresco]] painting from the Nazarenes. He painted historical works, such as ''The Poles did nobly and the Russian General Craved and Armistice to bury his Dead'' (1832) and ''Traitor's Gate'' (1842). His most ambitious historical work was the [[triptych]] ''Sir William Wallace, Scottish Wars: the Spear and English War: the Bow'' (1843). He also produced etchings for versions of [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge|Coleridge]]'s ''[[Ancient Mariner]]'', [[John Bunyan|Bunyan]]'s ''[[Pilgrim's Progress]]'' and [[J. P. Nichol]]'s ''Architecture of the Heavens'' (1850). Because of this early death he was known to, and admired by, the Pre-Raphaelites mainly through his brother [[William Bell Scott]] (1811–90), who became a close friend of founding member [[D. G. Rossetti]]. His most famous work, ''Iron and Coal'' was one of the most popular Victorian images and one of the few to fulfill the Pre-Raphaelite ambition to depict the modern world.&lt;ref&gt;Macmillan, ''Scottish Art'', pp.&amp;nbsp;205–8.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:William Dyce 002.jpg|thumb|right|[[William Dyce]] ''[[Pegwell Bay, Kent – a Recollection of October 5th 1858]]'' (c. 1859–60)]]
The figure in Scottish art most associated with the Pre-Raphaelites was the Aberdeen-born [[William Dyce]] (1806–64). He met the Nazarenes while in Italy and his work moved towards their "early Christian" art, as can be seen in his ''Madonna and Child'' (1848). Dyce befriended the young Pre-Raphaelites in London and introduced their work to [[John Ruskin]].&lt;ref&gt;Macmillan, ''Scottish Art'', p. 348.&lt;/ref&gt; His later work was Pre-Raphaelite in its spirituality, as can be seen in his ''The Man of Sorrows'' and ''David in the Wilderness'' (both 1860). His ''Pegwell Bay: a Recollection of October 5th 1858'' has been described as "the archetypal pre-Raphaelite landscape".&lt;ref&gt;MacDonald, ''Scottish Art'', p. 100.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Joseph Noel Paton]] (1821–1901) studied at the Royal Academy schools in London, where he became a friend of [[John Everett Millais]] and he subsequently followed him into Pre-Raphaelitism, producing pictures that stressed detail and melodrama such as ''The Bludie Tryst'' (1855). His later paintings, like those of Millais, have been criticised for descending into popular sentimentality.&lt;ref name="Macmillan"&gt;Macmillan, ''Scottish Art'', p. 213.&lt;/ref&gt; Also influenced by Millais was [[James Archer (artist)|James Archer]] (1823–1904) and whose work includes ''Summertime, Gloucestershire'' (1860)&lt;ref name="Macmillan" /&gt; and who from 1861 began a series of [[Arthurian]]-based paintings including ''La Morte d'Arthur'' and ''Sir Lancelot and Queen Guinevere''.&lt;ref&gt;R.

==Arts and Crafts==
{{See also|Arts and Crafts movement}}
The beginnings of the Arts and Crafts movement in Scotland were in the stained glass revival of the 1850s, pioneered by [[James Ballantine]] (1808–77). His major works included the great west window of [[Dunfermline Abbey]] and the scheme for [[St. Giles Cathedral]], Edinburgh. In Glasgow it was pioneered by [[Daniel Cottier]] (1838–91), who had probably studied with Ballantine, and was directly influenced by [[William Morris]], [[Ford Madox Brown]] and [[John Ruskin]]. His key works included the ''Baptism of Christ'' in [[Paisley Abbey]] (c. 1880). Among his followers were Stephen Adam and his son of the same name.&lt;ref&gt;MacDonald, ''Scottish Art'', p. 151.&lt;/ref&gt; The Glasgow-born designer and theorist [[Christopher Dresser]] (1834–1904) was one of the first, and most important, independent designers, a pivotal figure in the [[Aesthetic Movement]] and a major contributor to the allied [[Anglo-Japanese]] movement.  He produced carpets, ceramics, furniture, glass, graphics, metalwork, including silver and electroplate, including his angular teapot of 1879.&lt;ref&gt;H.

==Celtic Revival==

[[File:Edward Atkinson Hornel - Druids Bringing In The Mistletoe.jpg|thumb|upright|left|''Druids Bringing in the Mistletoe'' by [[Edward Atkinson Hornel|E. A. Hornel]] (c. 1890)]]
The formation of the Edinburgh Social Union in 1885, which included a number of significant figures in the Arts and Craft and Aesthetic movements, became part of an attempt to facilitate a [[Celtic Revival]], similar to that taking place in contemporaneous Ireland, drawing on ancient myths and history to produce art in a modern idiom.&lt;ref name=Gardiner2005p170&gt;M. Gardiner, ''Modern Scottish Culture'' (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2005), {{ISBN|0-7486-2027-3}}, p. 170.&lt;/ref&gt; Key figures were the philosopher, sociologist, town planner and writer [[Patrick Geddes]] (1854–1932), the architect and designer [[Robert Lorimer]] (1864–1929) and stained-glass artist [[Douglas Strachan]] (1875–1950). Geddes established an informal college of tenement flats for artists at [[Ramsay Garden]] on Castle Hill in Edinburgh in the 1890s. Among the figures involved with the movement were [[Anna Traquair]] (1852–1936), who was commissioned by the Union to paint murals in the Mortuary Chapel of the [[Royal Hospital for Sick Children, Edinburgh|Hospital for Sick Children, Edinburgh]] (1885–86 and 1896–98) and also worked in metal, illumination, illustration, embroidery and book binding.&lt;ref name=MacDonad2000p155-6&gt;MacDonald, ''Scottish Art'', pp.&amp;nbsp;155–6.&lt;/ref&gt;

The most significant exponent of the revival was Dundee-born [[John Duncan (painter)|John Duncan]] (1866–1945), who was also influenced by [[Italian Renaissance art]] and French [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolism]]. Among his most influential works are his paintings of Celtic subjects ''Tristan and Iseult'' (1912) and ''St Bride'' (1913). Other Dundee Symbolists included Stewart Carmichael (1879–1901) and George Dutch Davidson (1869–1950).&lt;ref name=MacDonad2000p155-6/&gt; Duncan was a major contributor to Geddes' magazine ''The Evergreen''. Other major contributors included the Japanese-influenced [[Robert Burns (artist)|Robert Burns]] (1860–1941), [[Edward Atkinson Hornel|E. A. Hornel]] (1864–1933) and Duncan's student Helen Hay (fl. 1895–1953).&lt;ref&gt;MacDonald, ''Scottish Art'', pp.&amp;nbsp;156–7.&lt;/ref&gt;{{clear}}

==Glasgow School==
{{Main|Glasgow School}}
[[File:Charles Rennie Mackintosh - The Wassail 1900.jpg|thumb|right|[[Charles Rennie Mackintosh]] ''The Wassail'' (1900)]]
Developments in late nineteenth-century Scottish art are associated with the Glasgow School, a term that is used for a number of loose groups based around the city. The first and largest group, active from about 1880, were the [[Glasgow Boys]], including [[James Guthrie (artist)|James Guthrie]] (1859–1930), [[Joseph Crawhall]] (1861–1913), [[George Henry (painter)|George Henry]] (1858–1943) and [[Edward Arthur Walton|E. A. Walton]] (1860–1922).&lt;ref name=Billcliffe2009&gt;Billcliffe, ''The Glasgow Boys''.&lt;/ref&gt; They reacted against the commercialism and sentimentality of earlier artists, particularly the work associated with Royal Academy. They were particularly influenced by London-based US artist [[James Abbott McNeill Whistler]]&lt;ref name=MacDonald2000p131&gt;MacDonald, ''Scottish Art'', p. 131.&lt;/ref&gt; and French painting, incorporated elements of [[impressionism]] and [[Realism (art)|realism]] into their work. They have been credited with rejuvenating Scottish art and with making Glasgow a major cultural centre.&lt;ref name=Chilvers2009p255&gt;Chilvers, ''The Oxford Dictionary of Art and Artists'', p. 255.&lt;/ref&gt;

A slightly later grouping, active from about 1890 and known as "The Four" or the "Spook School", was composed of acclaimed architect and artist [[Charles Rennie Mackintosh]] (1868–1928), his wife the painter and [[Studio glass|glass artist]] [[Margaret MacDonald (artist)|Margaret MacDonald]] (1865–1933), her sister the artist [[Frances MacDonald|Frances]] (1873–1921), and her husband, the artist and teacher [[Herbert MacNair]] (1868–1955). They produced a distinctive blend of influences, including the Celtic Revival, the Arts and Crafts Movement, and [[Japonisme]], which found favour throughout the [[modern art]] world of continental Europe and helped define the [[Art Nouveau]] style that would come to prominence in the early twentieth century.&lt;ref&gt;S.

The '''Société des Artistes Indépendants''' (''Society of Independent Artists''), '''Salon des Indépendants''' was formed in [[Paris]] on 29 July 1884. The association began with the organization of massive exhibitions in Paris, choosing the slogan "''sans jury ni récompense''" ("without jury nor reward"). [[Albert Dubois-Pillet]], [[Odilon Redon]], [[Georges Seurat]] and [[Paul Signac]] were among its founders. For the following three decades their annual exhibitions set the trends in art of the early 20th century, along with the [[Salon d'Automne]]. This is where artworks were often first displayed and widely discussed. [[World War I]] brought a closure to the salon, though the ''Artistes Indépendants'' remained active. Since 1920, the headquarters is located in the vast basements of the [[Grand Palais]] (next door to the ''[[Société des Artistes Français]]'', the ''[[Société Nationale des Beaux Arts|Société Nationale des Beaux-Arts]]'', the [[Salon d'Automne|Société du Salon d'Automne]], and others).

==History==
[[Image:Signac - Portrait de Félix Fénéon.jpg|thumb|right|[[Paul Signac]], 1890, ''Portrait of [[Félix Fénéon]], Opus 217. Against the Enamel of a Background Rhythmic with Beats and Angles, Tones, and Tints'', oil on canvas, 73.5 x 92.5 cm, [[Museum of Modern Art]], [[New York City]]]]
The '''Salon des Indépendants''' (Salon des Artistes Indépendants) is an annual independent art exhibition aimed at a large audience that takes place in Paris. It was established in response to the rigid traditionalism of the official government-sponsored Salon. Since the first exhibition of 1884, at the Pavilion de la ville de Paris ([[Champs-Élysées]]), the organizing Société des Artistes Indépendants has vowed to bring together the works of artists claiming a certain independence in their art. The event is characterized by the absence of both awards and a selection jury. There are however placement or hanging committees. In contrast to the [[Salon d'Automne]], which takes place in Paris during autumn months, the Indépendants is held during the springtime, inspiring artistic production during winter months, as artists prepare for the show. Several important dates have marked the history of the salon.

During the [[Second French Empire|Second Empire]], artists not backed by the official ''[[Académie de peinture et de sculpture]]'' in charge of the exhibits at the annual ''Salon'' or without support supplied by actual political constellations had little chance to advance. From year to year the number of artists working in Paris, the number of artists submitting works to the official ''[[Paris Salon|Salon]]'' and the number of works refused by the jury increased, but neither the Second Empire nor the [[French Third Republic|Third Republic]] found an answer to this situation.

For years, the artists had counted on official support. In 1884, finally, the artists began to organise themselves, and a "''Group of independent artists''" was authorised by the Ministry of Fine Arts to arrange an exhibition, while the City of Paris agreed to supply rooms for the presentation. So, from May 15 through July 15, the first "free" exhibition of contemporary art showed more than 5000 works by more than 400 artists.

Although sustained by Mesureur, deputy chairman of the Council of Paris and [[Grandmaster (Masonic)|Grand Master]] of the [[Grand Lodge]] of France, by Frédéric Hattat, chairman of the Fine Art commission in the same council, by Albert Dubois-Pillet, commanding the [[French Republican Guard|Republican Guard]], member of the [[Grand Orient de France]], the beginning of the Company, considered as a nest of [[revolutionaries]], were difficult.

===Establishment===
June 11, 1884, Maître Coursault, notary at [[Montmorency, Val-d'Oise]], officially confirmed the establishment of the ''Société''

Article 1 of the organization's statutes reads,
:...the purpose of ''Société des Artistes Indépendants'' – based on the principle of abolishing admission jury – is to allow the artists to present their works to public judgement with complete freedom.

===Groupe vs. Société===
Members of the ''Groupe'' challenged this foundation and succeeded to have an exhibition arranged "for the victims of the recent [[cholera]] epidemic", inaugurated December 1, 1884, by Lucien Boué, President of the Paris City Council. But financially the result was a catastrophe. Nevertheless, in spring 1885, the "Groupe" organised its next exhibition, this time with some success.

==Early exhibitions==
[[File:Baigneurs a Asnieres.jpg|thumb|[[Georges Seurat]] 1884, retouched 1887, ''Une baignade à Asnières'' (''Bathers in Asnières''), oil on canvas, 201 x 300 cm, [[National Gallery]], London]]
[[File:Henri Edmond Cross La Plage de Saint-Clair.jpg|thumb|[[Henri-Edmond Cross]], 1896, ''La Plage de Saint-Clair'', oil on canvas, 54.5 by 65.4 cm]]
The Salon des Indépendants arose through the need by artists to present their works to the general public independently, rather than through the official selective method of the "Salon" (created by [[Louis XIV]]).&lt;ref name="Indépendants"&gt;[http://www.artistes-independants.fr/index.php?page=historique&amp;chlangue=us Société des Artistes Indépendants, History]&lt;/ref&gt; A small collective of innovative artists—[[Paul Cézanne]], [[Paul Gauguin]], [[Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec]], [[Camille Pissarro]] along with [[Albert Dubois-Pillet]], [[Odilon Redon]], [[Georges Seurat]], [[Paul Signac]]—created the Salon des Indépendants. The right to present their works to the public with no restrictions was their only condition. Article no. 1 of the By-laws of the organization: "The purpose of Société des Artistes Indépendants—based on the principle of abolishing admission jury—is to allow the artists to present their works to public judgement with complete freedom".&lt;ref name="Indépendants" /&gt;

On 1 December 1884, Lucien Boué, President of the Paris City Council, opened the first Salon des Artistes Indépendants at the Palais Polychrome (near the Palais de l'Industrie). The Salon became the refuge for artworks deemed unacceptable by the traditional Salon. Among the works exhibited were Seurat's "[[Bathers at Asnières|La baignade à Asnières]]" Signac's "Le Pont d'Austerlitz", and works of [[Henri-Edmond Cross]], [[Odilon Redon]], [[Albert Dubois-Pillet]], [[Louis Valtat]], [[Armand Guillaumin]], [[Charles Angrand]], [[Paul Cézanne]], [[Paul Gauguin]], [[Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec]], and [[Vincent van Gogh]].&lt;ref name="Indépendants" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Webster"&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/concise/salon%20des%20Indépendants Salon des Indépendants, Merriam-Webster]&lt;/ref&gt;

The proceeds of the first show were earmarked for the victims of [[cholera]]. The second exhibition was held in 1886 in a temporary building in the [[Tuileries Garden]] with 200 paintings exhibited. By 1905 [[Henri Rousseau]], [[Pierre Bonnard]], [[Jean Metzinger]] and [[Henri Matisse]] had exhibited there.&lt;ref name="Webster" /&gt; During the period between 1890 and 1914 known as ''La [[Belle Époque]]'' practically all of the artists associated with [[modernism]] and the [[avant-garde]] exhibited at the Indépendants. The works exhibited ranged in style from [[Realism (arts)|Realist]] to [[Post-Impressionism|post-Impressionist]], [[Les Nabis|Nabis]], [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolist]], [[Neo-impressionism|Neo-impressionist]]/[[Divisionism|Divisionist]], [[Fauvism|Fauve]], [[Expressionism|Expressionist]], [[Cubism|Cubist]] and [[Abstract art]].

The submission payment was 10 francs for four works. In 1906 ten works could be submitted for 25 francs and from 1909 only two. In 1901 more than thousand paintings were shown. 2,395 works were exhibited in 1904, and 1905, 4,269 works by 669 artists. By 1908 six thousand works were displayed at the Indépendants. In 1910 the number of artists increased to 1,182, rising progressively to 2,175 by 1930. In 1926 the critic [[Louis Vauxcelles]] estimated that only 100 of the 3,726 artworks were of any value.&lt;ref name="Kubisme"&gt;[http://www.kubisme.info/kt323.html Kubisme.info, Salon des Indépendants]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1895 and 1897 the Salon des Indépendants was held at the [[:fr:Palais des Beaux-Arts et des Arts libéraux|Palais des Beaux-Arts et des Arts libéraux]] ([[Champ de Mars]]). Between 1901 and 1907, the exhibition was held in the Grandes Serres de la Ville de Paris (Cours-la-Reine, Paris), also called ''Grande Serre de l'Alma'', built for the [[Exposition Universelle (1900)|Exposition Universelle]] of 1900. From 1920 the exhibitions were held at the [[Grand Palais|Grand Palais des Champs-Elysées]] in Paris.&lt;ref name="Kubisme" /&gt;

In 1902 the Indépendants featured a retrospective of works by Toulouse-Lautrec. [[Jean Metzinger]] sent three paintings to the Salon des Indépendants in 1903, and subsequently moved to Paris with the proceeds from their sale. He again exhibiting several paintings, this time along with [[Robert Delaunay]], at the Indépendants of 1904, where Cross presented his Venice series. In 1905 the salon featured retrospectives of works by Seurat and [[Vincent van Gogh]].&lt;ref name="Kubisme" /&gt;

From 24 March to 30 April, the burgeoning of Fauvism was visible at the Indépendants, prior to the infamous Salon d'Automne exhibition of 1905 which historically marks the birth of the term Fauvism, after critic [[Louis Vauxcelles]] described their show of work with the phrase "[[Donatello]] chez les fauves" ("Donatello among the wild beasts"),&lt;ref name="Gil Blas, 17 October 1905"&gt;[http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k7522165g/f5.image Louis Vauxcelles, ''Le Salon d'Automne'', Gil Blas, 17 October 1905.

At the 1905 Indépendants [[Henri Matisse]] exhibited with [[Albert Marquet]], [[Jean Puy]], [[Henri Manguin]], [[Othon Friesz]], [[Raoul Dufy]], [[Kees van Dongen]], [[André Derain]], [[Maurice de Vlaminck]], [[Charles Camoin]] and [[Jean Metzinger]].&lt;ref name="21ème catalogue"&gt;[http://cdm16028.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/compoundobject/collection/p16028coll4/id/4116/rec/100 Société des artistes indépendants: catalogue de la 21ème exposition, 1905, Digital collection: Rare Books in the Thomas J. Watson Library, Metropolitan Museum of Art (New York, N.Y.)]&lt;/ref&gt; This exhibition was reviewed by Vauxcelles in [[Gil Blas]] on 4, 18 and 23 March 1905.&lt;ref name="Clement"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=VcaMyvjUZhIC&amp;pg=PR23&amp;lpg=PR23&amp;dq=salle+VII,+salon+d'automne+de+1905&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=alVRJahAml&amp;sig=6SkzgOftNxhpsdYdDNKbJjzqXUY&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=metzinger&amp;f=false Russell T.

Matisse exhibited the proto-Fauve painting ''[[Luxe, Calme et Volupté]]''. In the [[Divisionism|Divisionist]] technique and brightly colored, it was painted in 1904, after a summer spent working in [[St. Tropez]] on the [[French Riviera]] alongside the [[neo-Impressionism|neo-Impressionist]] painters [[Paul Signac]] and [[Henri-Edmond Cross]].&lt;ref&gt;UCLA Art Council et al. 1966, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; The painting is Matisse's most important work in which he used the Divisionist technique advocated by Signac, which Matisse had first adopted after reading Signac's essay, "D'Eugène Delacroix au Néo-impressionisme" in 1898.&lt;ref&gt;Oxford Art Online, "Henri Matisse"&lt;/ref&gt; Signac purchased the work after the 1905 Salon des Indépendants.

Matisse is in charge of the hanging committee, assisted by Metzinger, Bonnard, Camoin, Laprade Luce, Manguin, Marquet, Puy and Vallotton.&lt;ref name="Clement" /&gt;

==1906, all the Fauves==
[[File:Bonheur Matisse.jpg|thumb|[[Henri Matisse]], 1905-06, ''[[Le bonheur de vivre]]'', oil on canvas, 175 x 241 cm (69 × 95 in), [[Barnes Foundation]], [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]]]]
At the Salon des Indépendants of 1906 the elected members of the hanging committee included Matisse, Signac and Metzinger. Following the Salon d'Automne of 1905 which marked the beginning of Fauvism, the Salon des Indépendants of 1906 marked the first time all the Fauves would exhibit together. The centerpiece of the exhibition was Matisse's monumental ''[[Le Bonheur de Vivre]] (The Joy of Life)''.&lt;ref name="Clement" /&gt; The triangular composition is closely related to Cézanne's Bathers; a series that would soon become a source of inspiration for Picasso's ''[[Les Demoiselles d'Avignon]]''. Critics were horrified by the flatness, bright colors, eclectic style and mixed technique of ''Le Bonheur de Vivre''.

According to Metzinger's memoirs, it was at the 1906 Salon des Indépendants that he met [[Albert Gleizes]] and visited his studio in Courbevoie several days later. In 1907, at Max Jacob's place, Metzinger met Guillaume Krotowsky, who already signed his works [[Guillaume Apollinaire]].&lt;ref name="Daniel Robbins"&gt;Daniel Robbins, ''Jean Metzinger: At the Center of Cubism'', 1985, Jean Metzinger in Retrospect, The University of Iowa Museum of Art, J. Paul Getty Trust, University of Washington Press, pp. 9-23&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1906 Metzinger had acquired enough prestige to be elected to the hanging committee of the Salon des Indépendants, in addition to his entry of eight works.&lt;ref name="21ème catalogue" /&gt; He formed a close friendship at this time with Robert Delaunay, with whom he would share an exhibition at [[Berthe Weill]]'s gallery early in 1907. The two of them were singled out by one critic (Louis Vauxcelles) in 1907 as Divisionists who used large, mosaic-like 'cubes' to construct small but highly symbolic compositions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.all-art.org/art_20th_century/metzinger1.html Art of the 20th Century]&lt;/ref&gt;

==1907, the wholesale transformation==
In the spring of 1906 [[Georges Braque]] exhibited his works for the first time at the Salon des Indépendants. At the exhibition of 1907, held from 20 March to 30 April, six paintings by Braque were exhibited. Five were purchased directly at the Salon des Indépendants by the art dealer Wilhelm Uhde for a total price of 505 FF. The sixth work was presumably bought by the art dealer [[Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler|Kahnweiler]].&lt;ref name="Kubisme" /&gt; It was around this time that Braque first met Kahnweiler and was introduced to [[Picasso]] by Guillaume Apollinaire. Braque's works were still Fauve in nature. It wasn't until the autumn of 1907 at L’Estaque that Braque began his transition away from bright hues to more subdued colors, possibly as a result of the memorial exhibition of Cézanne’s work at the [[Salon d'Automne]] of 1907.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20130415082615/http://www.moma.org/m/explore/collection/art_terms/744/0/1.iphone_ajax?klass=artist Lewis Kachur, ''Georges Braque'', MoMA, Oxford University Press]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[André Derain]] exhibited his ''Dancer at Le Rat Mort'', painted during the winter of 1906, and his large ''Bathers'' ([[Museum of Modern Art]], New York) of early 1907. No longer truly Fauve, this work is close to Cézanne in its angular form and tonal modeling.

Matisse's ''[[Blue Nude (Souvenir de Biskra)]]'' also appeared at the 1907 Indépendants, entitled ''Tableau no. III''. Vauxcelles writes on the topic of ''Nu bleu'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;I admit to not understanding. An ugly nude woman is stretched out upon grass of an opaque blue under the palm trees... This is an artistic effect tending toward the abstract that escapes me completely. (Vauxcelles, Gil Blas, 20 March 1907)&lt;ref name="Clement" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

''Blue Nude'' would later create a sensation at the [[Armory Show]] of 1913 in New York City.&lt;ref&gt;Matisse, Henri." Encyclopædia Britannica. 2007. Encyclopædia Britannica Online. Retrieved 30 July 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The painting, already a certain distance from Fauvism, was deemed so ugly students burned it in effigy at the 1913 Armory Show in Chicago, where it had toured from New York.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.artinfo.com/modernartnotes/2010/11/the-response-to-matisses-blue-nude/ Tyler Green, Modern Art Notes, ''The Response to Matisse's Blue Nude'']&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the works of Matisse, Derain and Braque, the Indépendants of 1907 included six works (each) by Vlaminck, Dufy, Metzinger, Delaunay, Camoin, Herbin, Puy, and Valtat, and three by Marquet.

Vaucelles described this group of 'Fauves':

&lt;blockquote&gt;A movement I consider dangerous (despite the great sympathy I have for its perpetrators) is taking shape among a small clan of youngsters. A chapel has been established, two haughty priests officiating. MM Derain and Matisse; a few dozen innocent catechumens have received their baptism. Their dogma amounts to a wavering schematicism that proscribes modeling and volumes in the name of I-don't-know-what pictorial abstraction. This new religion hardly appeals to me. I don't believe in this Renaissance... M. Matisse, fauve-in-chief; M. Derain, fauve deputy; MM. Othon Friesz and Dufy, fauves in attendance... and M. Delaunay (a fourteen-year-old-pupil of M. Metzinger...), infantile fauvelet. (Vauxcelles, Gil Blas, 20 March 1907)&lt;ref name="Clement" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:Jean Metzinger, 1907, Paysage coloré aux oiseaux aquatique, oil on canvas, 74 x 99 cm, Musée d’Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris.jpg|thumb|[[Jean Metzinger]], 1907, ''[[Paysage coloré aux oiseaux aquatiques]]'', oil on canvas, 74 x 99 cm, [[Musée d’Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris]]]]
The Fauvism of Matisse and Derain was virtually over by the spring of the 1907 Indépendants. And by the Salon d'Automne of 1907 it had ended for many others as well. The shift from bright pure colors loosely applied to the canvas gave way to a more calculated geometric approach. The priority of simplified form began to overtake the representational aspect of the works. The simplification of representational form gave way to a new complexity; the subject matter of the paintings progressively became dominated by a network of interconnected geometric planes, the distinction between foreground and background no longer sharply delineated, and the depth of field limited.

Many of Cézanne's paintings had been exhibited at the Salon d'Automne of 1904, 1905 and 1906. After Cézanne died in 1906, his paintings were exhibited in Paris in the form of a retrospective at the [[Salon d'Automne]] of 1907, greatly attracting interest and affecting the direction taken by the avant-garde artists in Paris prior to the advent of [[Cubism]]. Cézanne's explorations of geometric simplification and optical phenomena inspired not just Matisse, Derain, Braque and Metzinger, but the other artists who exhibited earlier with the Fauves. Those who had not transited through a Fauve stage, such as Picasso, experimented, too, with the complex fracturing of form. Cézanne had thus sparked a wholesale transformation in the area of artistic investigation that would profoundly affect the development [[modern art]] of the 20th century.

==1908, barbarous schematizers==
[[File:Henri le Fauconnier, 1908, Ploumanac'h.jpg|right|thumb|Henri le Fauconnier, 1908, ''Ploumanac'h'', Museum Kranenburgh, Bergen, Holland]]

Signac becomes president of the 24th Salon des Indépendants. At the exhibition of 1908, held 20 March through 2 May, a painting by Braque strikes Apollinaire by its originality. Though not listed in the catalog, it was described in ''L'Intransigeant''.&lt;ref name="Kubisme" /&gt; In his review published in ''La Revue des lettres et des arts'' (1 May 1908) Apollinaire claims that Braque's work is the most original effort presented at the salon. Even in the absence of Matisse and Picasso, Vauxcelles, in Gil Blas (20 March 1908) refers to the most innovative artists of the exposition as 'barbarous schematizers'... who want to create an 'abstract art'.&lt;ref name="Clement" /&gt;

This exhibition was reviewed in the ''New York Herald'' 20 March 1908; by Vauxcelles in ''Gil Blas'' 20 March 1908; by C. Le Senne in ''Le Courrier du Soir'', 22 March 1908; and by [[Maurice Denis]], in ''La Grande revue'', 10 April 1908.&lt;ref name="Clement" /&gt;

In excess of 1,314 artists exhibit 6,701 works. Matisse does not submit any works.

After this salon, the writer [[Gelett Burgess]] begins a series of interviews with the avant-garde working currently in Paris and surrounding [[banlieue]]s. These interviews and Burgess' impressions of the works produced are published in ''Architectural Record'', May 1910, at the heart of the [[Proto-Cubism|proto-Cubist]] period.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.architecturalrecord.com/articles/11445-the-wild-men-of-paris Gelett Burgess, "The Wild Men of Paris", ''The Architectural Record'', May 1910]&lt;/ref&gt;

Gelett Burgess writes in ''The Wild Men of Paris'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Though the school was new to me, it was already an old story in Paris. It had been a nine-days’ wonder. Violent discussions had raged over it; it had taken its place as a revolt and held it, despite the fulmination of critics and the contempt of academicians. The school was increasing in numbers, in importance. By many it was taken seriously. At first, the beginners had been called "The Invertebrates." In the Salon of 1905 they were named "The Incoherents." But by 1906, when they grew more perfervid, more audacious, more crazed with theories, they received their present appellation of "Les Fauves"—the Wild Beasts. And so, and so, a-hunting I would go!"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

"It was Matisse who took the first step into the undiscovered land of the ugly. Matisse himself, serious, plaintive, a conscientious experimenter, whose works are but studies in expression, who is concerned at present with but the working out of the theory of simplicity, denies all responsibility for the excesses of his unwelcome disciples."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

"Picasso, keen as a whip, spirited as a devil, mad as a hatter, runs to his studio and contrives a huge nude woman composed entirely of triangles, and presents it in triumph. What wonder Matisse shakes his head and does not smile! He chats thoughtfully of the "Harmony and volume" and "architectural values," and wild Braque climbs to his attic and builds an architectural monster which he names Woman, with balanced masses and parts, with openings and columnar legs and cornices. Matisse praises the direct appeal to instinct of the African wood images, and even a sober Dérain, a co-experimenter, loses his head, moulds a neolithic man into a solid cube, creates a woman of spheres, stretches a cat out into a cylinder, and paints it red and yellow!"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

"Metzinger once did gorgeous mosaics of pure pigment, each little square of color not quite touching the next, so that an effect of vibrant light should result. He painted exquisite compositions of cloud and cliff and sea; he painted women and made them fair, even as the women upon the boulevards fair. But now, translated into the idiom of subjective beauty, into this strange Neo-Classic language, those same women, redrawn, appear in stiff, crude, nervous lines in patches of fierce color."&lt;ref name="Gelett Burgess"&gt;[http://archrecord.construction.com/inthecause/0702MenOfParis/MenOfParis3.asp Gelett Burgess, ''The Wild Men of Paris'', The Architectural Record, May 1910, documents p. 3, Interview with Jean Metzinger, circa 1908-09]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==1909, simplified forms==
According to John Golding's influential history of Cubism published in 1959, it was at the Salon des Indépendants of 1909, held 25 March through 2 May, that one of the first Cubist painting was exhibited to the public: ''Little Harbor in Normandy (Petit port en Normandie)'', no. 215, entitled ''Paysage'', by Georges Braque ([[Art Institute of Chicago]]). On 25 March 1909, Louis Vauxcelles qualifies the works of Braque (Bracke, sic) exhibited at the [[Salon des Indépendants]] as "bizarreries cubiques" (cubic oddities).&lt;ref&gt;[http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k7536065n Louis Vauxcelles, ''Le Salon des Indépendants'', Gil Blas, 25 March 1909], Gallica (BnF)&lt;/ref&gt; In Room 16 hung works by Derain, Dufy, Friesz, Laprade, Matisse, Jean Puy, Rouault and Vlaminck.&lt;ref name="Kubisme" /&gt;

The evolution towards a more linear style with simplified forms continues with greater emphasis on clear geometric principles (derived from Cézanne) not solely visible in the works of Braque, but too in the works of Metzinger, Gleizes, Le Fauconnier and Delaunay (Picasso being absent from the salons).&lt;ref name="Daniel Robbins" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Brooke, Gleizes"&gt;[http://www.peterbrooke.org.uk/a&amp;r/chronology Peter Brooke, ''Albert Gleizes, Chronology of his life, 1881-1953'']&lt;/ref&gt;

==1910, ignorant geometers==
[[File:Henri Rousseau - Le Rêve - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|[[Henri Rousseau]] (Le Douanier), 1910, ''[[The Dream (Rousseau painting)|The Dream]]'', [[MoMA]]. Exhibited at the 1910 Indépendants a few months before his death]]
Gleizes exhibits in the Salon des Indépendants for the first time: ''Portrait de René Arcos'' and ''[[L'Arbre, The Tree (Gleizes)|L'Arbre]]'', two paintings in which the emphasis on simplified geometric form overwhelms to a large extent the representational interest of the painting.&lt;ref name="Brooke, Gleizes" /&gt; The same tendency is evident in Metzinger's ''Portrait of Apollinaire'' exhibited in the same salon. According to Apollinaire this was the 'first Cubist portrait'. Apollinaire himself has pointed out in his book ''The Cubist Painters'' (1913), that Metzinger, following Picasso and Braque, was chronologically the third Cubist artist.&lt;ref name="S. E. Johnson"&gt;S. E. Johnson, 1964, Metzinger, Pre-Cubist and Cubist Works, 1900-1930, International Galleries, Chicago&lt;/ref&gt;
According to Gleizes's memoirs, [[Alexandre Mercereau]] introduces him to Metzinger, but only after the Salon d'Automne do they become seriously interested in each other's work.&lt;ref name="Brooke, Gleizes" /&gt;

Louis Vauxcelles, in his review of the 26th Salon des Indépendants (1910), made a passing and imprecise reference to Metzinger, Gleizes, Delaunay, Léger and Le Fauconnier, as "ignorant geometers, reducing the human body, the site, to pallid cubes."&lt;ref name="Daniel Robbins" /&gt;

The work of Metzinger, Le Fauconnier and Robert Delaunay were exhibited together. Le Fauconnier showed the geometrically simplified ''Ploumanac'h'' landscapes: ''Le Ravin'' and ''Village dans les Montagne'', along with ''Femme à l'éventail'' and ''Portrait of Maroussia''. In the same hall hung the works of Matisse, Vlaminck, Dufy, Laurencin, van Dongen and [[Henri Rousseau]].&lt;ref name="Kubisme" /&gt;

[[File:Boronali Impression.jpg|right|thumb|[[:fr:Joachim-Raphaël Boronali|Joachim-Raphaël Boronali]], 1910, ''Et le soleil s'endormit sur l'Adriatique'', oil on canvas, 54 x 80 cm, painted by the donkey Lolo. Exhibited at the Salon des Indépendants, 1910]]
Apollinaire wrote in the daily newspaper ''L'Intransigeant'', which had a circulation of about 50,000, about the exhibition that consisted of close to 6000 paintings.&lt;ref name="Kubisme" /&gt;

===1910, Lolo the donkey===
Remarkably, even the presence of a painting made by a donkey named Lolo passed by practically unnoticed.&lt;ref name="Kubisme" /&gt; The painting was entitled ''[[:fr:Et le soleil s'endormit sur l'Adriatique|Et le soleil s'endormit sur l'Adriatique]]'' presented by the artist [[:fr:Joachim-Raphaël Boronali|Joachim-Raphaël Boronali]], the 'excessivist' from Genoa was exhibited at the 1910 Salon des Indépendants. Boronali was in fact the Parisian donkey (Lolo), who made the painting with his tail. (Cf. Warnod, 1910; Weiss, 1994, pp.&amp;nbsp;149–151, 304.)&lt;ref&gt;[http://radicalart.info/process/vibration/animal/index.html The Mechanics of Expression: Donkeys, Humans, Monkeys, Cats and Elephants]&lt;/ref&gt; It is suspected that Lolo belonged to Frédéric Gérard ([[Lapin Agile#Le Lapin Agile à l'époque de Frédéric Gérard|« le père Frédé »]]), owner of the cabaret [[Lapin Agile]] in la butte [[Montmartre]]. [[Roland Dorgelès]] and two friends, [[:fr:André Warnod|André Warnod]] et [[Jules Depaquit]], attached a paint brush to the tail of the animal. The donkey did the rest. The painting sold for 400FF (equal to 1,257 Euros today&lt;ref&gt;[http://smariano.club.fr/pages/divers/conver-franc.htm Conversion table]&lt;/ref&gt;) and was donated by Dorgelès to the ''Orphelinat des Arts''.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Groinowski, ''Aux commencements du rire moderne. L'esprit fumiste'', [[José Corti]], Paris, 1997, p.296.&lt;/ref&gt; The painting forms part of the permanent collection at ''l'Espace culturel Paul Bédu'' ([[Milly-la-Forêt]]).

==1911, the major scandal of Cubism==

[[File:Delaunay ChampDeMars.jpg|thumb|upright|right|[[Robert Delaunay]], 1911, ''Champs de Mars. La Tour rouge'', [[Art Institute of Chicago]]. Exhibited at Salon des Indépendants, 1911]]
The newly formed Montparnasse group (who held meetings not just at Le Fauconnier's studio, but at the cafés ''[[Le Dôme Café|Le Dôme]], [[:fr:La Coupole (brasserie)|La Coupole]], [[:fr:La Closerie des Lilas|La Closerie des Lilas]], Le Select'', and ''[[Café de la Rotonde]]'') together with other young painters who also want to emphasise a research into form (as opposed to color) take over the hanging committee of the Salon des Indépendants ensuring that the works of painters now dubbed 'Cubists' would be shown together. Gleizes, Metzinger, Le Fauconnier, Delaunay, Léger and [[Marie Laurencin]] (at the request of Apollinaire) are shown together in Room 41.&lt;ref name="Brooke, Gleizes" /&gt;

The result of the group show is a major scandal. Even though the pictures shown are still conventional representations that generally observe the rules of classical perspective (according to Gleizes), the public is outraged by the representation of subject matter as cones, cubes and spheres, resulting in the obscurity of the subject matter. The predominance of sharp geometrical faceting and the fact that a group of artists are all working in similar directions, gives rise to the term 'Cubism'. Although this and similar terms have been used before in artistic circles (usually in relation to the works of Metzinger, Delaunay and Braque), this is the first time the use of the term becomes widespread.&lt;ref name="Brooke, Gleizes" /&gt;

The term 'Cubism' is employed in June 1911 by Apollinaire, speaking in the context of an exhibition in Brussels which includes works by Gleizes, Delaunay, Léger, and Le Fauconnier. During the summer, Gleizes is in close contact with Metzinger, who has recently moved to Meudon. Both are discontent with the conventional perspective mechanism. They have long conversations about the nature of form and perception. They agree that traditional painting gives a static and incomplete idea of the subject as experienced in life. Things, they conclude, are in fact dynamic, observed to move, are seen from different angles and can be captured at successive moments in time.&lt;ref name="Brooke, Gleizes" /&gt;

Another Cubist scandal is produced several months later at the Salon d'Automne, where the Indépendants exhibitors develop relations with the Duchamp brothers, [[Jacques Villon]], [[Raymond Duchamp-Villon]] and [[Marcel Duchamp]]. The studios of Jacques Villon and Raymond Duchamp-Villon at 7, rue Lemaître, become, together with Gleizes' studio at Courbevoie, regular meeting places for the newly formed ''Groupe de Puteaux'' (soon to exhibit under the name [[Section d'Or]]). [[František Kupka]], the Czech painter interested in [[Abstract art|non-representational]] painting based on analogies with music and the progressive abstraction of a subject in motion, joins the discussions.&lt;ref name="Brooke, Gleizes" /&gt;

In the spring of 1911 the cubists made sure they were shown together, infiltrating the placement committee. That Le Fauconnier was the secretary of the salon facilitated the goal of hanging their works together. Until then, works in alphabetical order of the artists names. In room 41 hung works by Metzinger, Gleizes, Léger, Delaunay, Le Fauconnier and Archipenko. In room 43 hung works by [[André Lhote]], [[Roger de La Fresnaye]], [[André Dunoyer de Segonzac]], Luc-Albert Moreau and [[André Mare]].&lt;ref name="Kubisme" /&gt;

This exhibition involved more than 6,400 paintings. In room 42 was a retrospective exhibition of [[Henri Rousseau|Henri (Le Douanier) Rousseau]], who died 2 September 1910. Articles and reviews were numerous and extensive in sheer words employed; including in Gil Blas, Comoedia, Excelsior, Action, L'Oeuvre, and Cri de Paris. Apollinaire wrote a long review in the 20 April 1911 issue of L'Intransigeant.&lt;ref name="Kubisme" /&gt;

Henri Le Fauconnier's ''Abundance'', 1910-11 (Haags Gemeentemuseum, Den Haag), partly due to its large size and partly to the treatment of its subject matter, was an eye-catcher, causing a sensation. This painting was soon bought by the Dutchman art critic and painter Conrad Kickert (1882-1965), who was secretary of the Contemporary Art Society ([[:es:Moderne Kunstkring|Moderne Kunstkring]]). In 1934 he donated the painting to the Gemeentemuseum, Den Haag.&lt;ref name="Kubisme" /&gt;

The Salon des Indépendants transpired in Paris from 20 March to 16 May 1912. This massive exhibition occurred exactly one year after Metzinger, Gleizes, Le Fauconnier, Delaunay, Léger and Laurencin were shown together in Room 41 of the 1911 Salon des Indépendants, which provoked the scandal out of which Cubism emerged and spread throughout Paris. Its wide-ranging repercussions were felt in Germany, Holland, Italy, Russia, Spain and elsewhere (influencing [[Futurism]], [[Suprematism]], [[Constructivism (art)|Constructivism]], [[De Stijl]] and so on). Just five months prior to this show another polemic developed at the Salon d'Automne of 1912. Originating in ''Salle XI'' where the Cubists exhibited their works, this quarrel involved both the French and non-French avant-garde artists. On 3 December 1912 the polemic reached the [[Chambre des députés]] and was debated at the ''Assemblée Nationale''. At stake was more than just the future of public funding for exhibitions that included Cubist art.&lt;ref name="Joyeux-Prunel"&gt;[http://histoiremesure.revues.org/index2333.html Béatrice Joyeux-Prunel, ''Histoire &amp; Mesure'', no. XXII -1 (2007), Guerre et statistiques, ''L'art de la mesure, Le Salon d'Automne (1903-1914), l'avant-garde, ses étranger et la nation française''] (The Art of Measure: The Salon d'Automne Exhibition (1903-1914), the Avant-Garde, its Foreigners and the French Nation), electronic distribution Caim for Éditions de l'EHESS (in French)&lt;/ref&gt; Le Fauconnier, Gleizes, Léger, Metzinger and Archipenko formed the core of the hanging committee at the 1912 Indépendants. The common hall, room 20, in which the Cubists placed themselves became the nucleus of the exhibition.c&lt;ref name="Kubisme" /&gt;

At the 1912 Salon des Indépendants Albert Gleizes exhibited ''[[Les Baigneuses (Gleizes)|Les Baigneuses (The Bathers)]]'' (no. 1347) — [[Marcel Duchamp]]'s ''[[Nude Descending a Staircase, No. 2]]'' was listed in the catalogue (n. 1001)&lt;ref&gt;[http://aulivrebleu.unblog.fr/page/2/ Hommage à Marcel Duchamp, Boîte-en-catalogue, 1912-2012, Salon des Indépendants, 1912, n. 1001 of the catalogue, Marcel Duchamp, ''Nu descendant l’escalier'']&lt;/ref&gt; but was withdrawn prior to the exhibition — [[Roger de La Fresnaye]] exhibited ''Artillerie'' (no. 1235) — [[Robert Delaunay]] showed his monumental ''Ville de Paris'' (no. 868) — [[Jean Metzinger]] exhibited ''[[La Femme au Cheval|La Femme au Cheval (Woman with a horse)]]'' and ''Le Port'' — [[Fernand Léger]] showed ''La Noce'' — [[Henri Le Fauconnier]], ''Le Chasseur (The Huntsman)'' — and the newcomer [[Juan Gris]] exhibited his ''Portrait of Picasso''.&lt;ref name="Joyeux-Prunel" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kubisme.info/kt323.html Salon des Indépendants, 1912, kubisme.info]&lt;/ref&gt;

The art critic Olivier-Hourcade writes of this exhibition in 1912 and its relation to the creation of a new French school: 'Metzinger with his ''Port'', Delaunay with ''Paris'', Gleizes with his ''Baigneuses, are close to this real and magnificent result, this victory comes from several centuries: the creation of a school of painting, 'French' and absolutely independent.&lt;ref name="Joyeux-Prunel" /&gt;

[[:fr:Roger Allard|Roger Allard]]'s reviewed the 1912 Salon des Indépendants in the March–April 1912 issue of La Revue de France et des Pays, noting Metzinger's 'refined choice of colors' and the 'precious rarity' of the painting's 'matière'. [[André Salmon]] too, in his review, noted Metzinger's 'refined use of color' in ''La Femme au Cheval'' and praised its 'French grace', while noting Metzinger 'illuminated a cubist figure with the virtues of a smile'.&lt;ref name="David Cottington"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=KFGgxn7lfq0C&amp;pg=PR11&amp;lpg=PR11&amp;dq=Jean+Metzinger,+1910,+1911,+1912&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=rm0CrcbXtN&amp;sig=a9Kf-dUKbXYjZbmLDg16tto5U0o&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=horse&amp;f=false David Cottington, ''Cubism and Its Histories''], Manchester University Press, 2004, p. 107&lt;/ref&gt;

Gleizes, on the other hand, would write in 1913 of the Cubist movements continual evolution:
{{quote|The changes it had already undergone since the Indépendants of 1911 could leave people in no doubt as to its nature. Cubism was not a school, distinguished by some superficial variation on a generally accepted norm. It was a total regeneration, indicating the emergence of a wholly new cast of mind. Every season it appeared renewed, growing like a living body. Its enemies could, eventually, have forgiven it if only it had passed away, like a fashion; but they became even more violent when they realised that it was destined to live a life that would be longer than that of those painters who had been the first to assume the responsibility for it.&lt;ref name="Brooke, P."&gt;[http://www.peterbrooke.org.uk/a&amp;r/gltexts/epic Albert Gleizes, 1925, ''The Epic, From immobile form to mobile form''], published in German, 1928, under the title ''Kubismus'', the French version was published as ''L'Epopée (The Epic)'', in the journal ''Le Rouge et le Noir'', 1929. Translation by Peter Brooke&lt;/ref&gt;}}

And regarding the reception received by the Cubists at the Salon des Indépendants and Salon d'Automne Gleizes writes:

{{quote|Never had a crowd been seen thrown into such a turmoil by works of the spirit, and especially over esemplastic works, paintings, whose nature it is to be silent", writes Albert Gleizes, "Never had the critics been so violent as they were at that time. From which it became clear that these paintings—and I specify the names of the painters who were, alone, the reluctant causes of all this frenzy: Jean Metzinger, Henri Le Fauconnier, Fernand Léger, Robert Delaunay and myself—appeared as a threat to an order that everyone thought had been established forever.&lt;ref name="Brooke, P." /&gt;}}

==1913, the peak of Cubism==
[[File:Juan Gris - Man in a Café.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Juan Gris]], 1912, ''Man in a Café'', oil on canvas, 127.6 x 88.3 cm, [[Philadelphia Museum of Art]]. Exhibited at the 1913 Salon des Indépendants.]]
The Salon des Indépendants was held March 9 through 18 May, the Cubist works were shown in room 46. [[Jean Metzinger]] exhibited his large ''[[L'Oiseau bleu (Metzinger)|L'Oiseau bleu]]'' — [[Albert Gleizes]], Albert Gleizes. ''Les Joueurs de football (Football Players)'' 1912-13, National Gallery of Art, Washington D.C — [[Robert Delaunay]] ''The Cardiff Team (L'équipe de Cardiff )'' 1913, Van Abbemuseum, Eindhoven — [[Fernand Léger]], ''Le modèle nu dans l'atelier (Nude Model In The Studio)'' 1912-13, [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum]], New York — [[Juan Gris]], ''L'Homme dans le Café (Man in Café)'' 1912, Philadelphia Museum of Art.

In room 45 hung the works of [[Robert Delaunay]], [[Sonia Delaunay]], [[František Kupka]], [[Morgan Russell]] and [[Macdonald-Wright]]. This was the first exhibition where [[Orphism (art)|Orphism]] and [[Synchromism]] were emphatically present. Apollinaire in ''L'Intransigeant'' mentioned la Salle hollandaise (room 43), which included Jacoba van Heemskerck, [[Piet Mondrian]], Otto van Rees, [[Jan Sluyters]] en [[Leo Gestel]] and Lodewijk Schelfhout.&lt;ref name="Kubisme" /&gt;

==1914, Orphism==
The 1914 exhibition, held from 1 March to 30 April, was composed of many Orphist works of large dimension and took place in one of the largest rooms on the ground floor: Robert and Sonia Delaunay, [[Patrick Henry Bruce]] and [[Arthur Burdett Frost]] were largely represented.&lt;ref name="Kubisme" /&gt;

==1915-1919==
During the First World War there were no exhibitions. After the war, however, there was a revival of Cubism, led by Gleizes and others, which included exhibitions at [[Léonce Rosenberg]]'s ''Galerie l'Effort Moderne'' and a revival of the Salon de la [[Section d'Or]].&lt;ref name="Kubisme" /&gt;

==1920, the emergence of Dada==
In an attempt to regain their pre-war status at the forefront of the avant-garde, and faced with the possibility of being overthrown by [[Dada]], the cubists regrouped.&lt;ref name="Witham"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=6xkkSVZz_OYC&amp;pg=PA137&amp;lpg=PA137&amp;dq=picasso+Salon+des+Indépendants&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=nD60pJBckp&amp;sig=V_8efFBPfjIOb4oX5_BM_ATg_WA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=UesTUeGrHIWq0QX004CYBA&amp;ved=0CEsQ6AEwDQ#v=onepage&amp;q=picasso%20Salon%20des%20Indépendants&amp;f=false Larry Witham, ''Picasso and the Chess Player: Pablo Picasso, Marcel Duchamp, and the Battle for the Soul of Modern Art'', University Press of New England (ebook) 2013], {{ISBN|978-1-61168-349-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their first chance to exhibit together presented itself at the Salon des Indépendants of 1920. But the fight wasn't going to be easy. Opening on 28 January, over three thousand works were display, a large number of which were Cubist paintings. For the first time the exhibition took place at the [[Grand Palais]] des [[Champs-Elysées]]. Picasso was nowhere to be seen, but others were, such as Archipenko, Braque, Csaky, Gleizes, Gris, Hayden, Herbin, Léger, Lhote, Lipchitz, Metzinger, Severini and Survage.&lt;ref name="Kubisme" /&gt;

The most outrageous Dada eruption to date transpired at the Salon des Indépendants of 1920. The Dadaist saw the Indépendants as decisive in the push to the top of the avant-garde food chain of the Parisian art scene. The plan was as cunning as it was devious: [[Tristan Tzara]] and [[André Breton]] rented an auditorium at the Grand Palais. A group guided by Tzara distributed flyers and posters saying that [[Charlie Chaplin]] would appear "in the flesh" on February 5. The crowd heckled when Chaplin (not even aware of the event) never showed up, and Tzara was ready: his group hurled insults back at the crowd from the stage.

The renown literary figure [[André Gide]] present in the audience, fooled as the others, described the happening: "Some young people, solemn, stilted, tied up in knots, got up on the platform and as a chorus declaimed insincere inanities".&lt;ref name="Witham" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gide quoted in Wayne Andrews, ''The Surrealist Parade'', New York: New Directions, 1990, p. 40, in Larry Witham, ''Picasso and the Chess Player: Pablo Picasso, Marcel Duchamp, and the Battle for the Soul of Modern Art'', 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

The offensive event witnessed by the more respectable Cubists solicited a vehement denunciation, declaring Dada an abomination.

==1921, a new epoch==
The Salon des Indépendants of 1921, which opened in January, had less Cubist paintings than the previous year. Braque and Metzinger were not represented. The artists that did exhibit included Gleizes, Ferat, Hayden, Marcoussis, Hellesen and Survage. With the Cubists were also [[Hélène Pordriat]], [[Marthe Laurens]], [[Irène Lagut]], [[Alice Halicka]] and [[Sonia Lewitska]]. At the exhibition were also the works of Bissière, Blanchard, [[Raoul Dufy|Dufy]], [[André Lhote|Lhote]], [[Henriette Tirman|Tirman]], Zadkine and Lipchitz.

The hanging commission was conducted in opposition to Signac, who was in favor of the alphabetical order system. Léger left the placement committee in 1923. In 1924 placement was classified by nationality and alphabetically. Lhote left the placement committee, which consisted of 20 people, along with eight other members in 1925. Lhote was of the opinion that the change was mainly intended for the "Sunday painters". Signac and his supporters defended the alphabetical order stressing 'equal attention to all participants' and that there was no place for 'les petites chapelles' (the little chapels). The latter was especially directed against the neo-cubists, who after the First World wished to be associated with well-known artists.&lt;ref name="Kubisme" /&gt;

From 1920 the ''Société des Artistes Indépendants'' obtained the Grand Palais for its salon exhibitions. After World War II, the ''Salon des Indépendants'' was renewed with the artist group ''[[:fr:Jeune création|Jeune création]]'', with the assistance of Dunoyer de Segonzac, [[Bernard Buffet]], [[Jean Carzou]], [[Maurice Boitel]], Yves Brayer, Aristide Caillaud, [[Daniel du Janerand]], amongst others.

'''The Gop''' ({{lang-cy|'''Coparleni'''}}) is a [[neolithic]] mound{{Elucidate|Why call this mound neolithic? Is it a human construct, built in the neolithic age? If not built by humans in that period, why is it called neolithic?|date=August 2016}} lying north of [[Trelawnyd]] in [[Flintshire]], [[Wales]], in the [[Clwydian Range]]. 

==Description==
Oval in form, it is the second-largest [[neolithic]] mound in Britain after [[Silbury Hill]]. Excavations have discovered prehistoric remains both in the caves below and in the mound itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Whitfield|first1=Paul|last2=Le Nevez|first2=Catherine|last3=Parker|first3=Mike|title=The Rough Guide to Wales|date=2012|isbn=978-1-40538-981-5|page=398|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=opqb0w3_lwAC&amp;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Excavations have uncovered no [[burial chamber]]s or other underground works, which may indicate that it was used as a look-out or [[hill fort]]; there is evidence that there was a considerable amount of stone on the top of hill. In the 17th&amp;nbsp;century, its prominent position allowed a [[beacon]] to be placed there.

The mound lies on top of '''Gop Hill''' (823 feet), a natural limestone outcrop, in the side of which are the Gop Caves.

'''Tirhuta Panchang''' ([[Devanagari script|Devanagari]]: तिरहुता पंचांग ''Tirhut pan̄cāṅg''  / [[Tirhuta script|Tirhuta]]: তিবহুতা পঞ্চাঙ্গ ''Tirhutā pan̄cāṅg'') is a calendar followed by the [[Maithils|Maithili]] community of India and Nepal. This calendar is one of the many Hindu calendars. It is a sidereal solar [[Hindu calendar]] in which the year begins on the first day of Baishakh month i.e. Mesh Sankranti. Every year, this day falls on 13/14 April of the Gregorian Calendar.

[[Pohela Boishakh]] in [[West Bengal]], [[Bohag Bihu]] in [[Assam]], [[Puthandu]] in Tamil Nadu, and [[Vaisakhi]] in the [[Punjab region]] are observed on the same day. These festivals also mark the beginning of the New Year in their respective regions.

===Baishakh-Jeth-Asarh===
These three months are the summer season in Mithila, out of these 3, Jeth &amp; Asarh are very hot. Baishakh is the month of Litchi. Jeth and Asarh are the months of Mango.&lt;ref&gt;Climate of North Bihar&lt;/ref&gt;

===Saon-Bhado===
Mithila receives heavy rainfall during these two months, often resulting in flooding. Farmers wait for saon's first rain so they can sow paddy in their fields. The holy month of saon is devoted to Lord [[Shiva]]. Devotees visit Baidnath Dham in [[Deoghar]] to offer gangajal.&lt;ref&gt;Climate of North Bihar&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Domestic Policy Council''' ('''DPC''') of the [[United States]] is the principal forum used by the [[President of the United States]] for considering [[domestic policy]] matters, excluding [[economics|economic]] matters, which are the domain of the [[United States National Economic Council|National Economic Council]]. The council forms part of the [[Office of White House Policy]] which contains the DPC, the National Economic Council and various subordinate offices, such as the [[Office of National AIDS Policy]]. The Director of the DPC is titled the Assistant to the President and Director of the Domestic Policy Council.

==History and mission==
The Domestic Policy Council was established on April 11, 1985, by President Ronald Reagan.&lt;ref&gt;http://digitalcollections.library.cmu.edu/awweb/awarchive?type=file&amp;item=481859&lt;/ref&gt; The first Executive Director of the Council was Dr. Ralph Bledsoe.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.reagan.utexas.edu/archives/textual/smof/bledsoe1.htm&lt;/ref&gt; President George H.W. Bush re-established the Council on February 8, 1989, appointing Dr. Kenneth Yale as Executive Director of the Council.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/1989/01/23/us/bush-s-team-the-first-choices.html&lt;/ref&gt; On August 16, 1993, the Council was expanded by {{Executive Order|12859}}. The Council oversees development and implementation of the President’s domestic policy agenda and ensures coordination and communication among the heads of relevant Federal offices and agencies.

Even before the formal creation of the DPC, some form of a domestic policy staff had existed in the White House since the 1960s. President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] assigned a senior-level aide to organize staff and develop domestic policy. In 1970, President [[Richard Nixon]] issued an executive order that created the Office of Policy Development, a large White House office with jurisdiction over economic and domestic policy. President [[Bill Clinton]] again altered the structure by splitting the office, forming the current Domestic Policy Council and the [[United States National Economic Council|National Economic Council]] which both exist today underneath the umbrella of the [[Office of White House Policy]], which can also be known as the Office of Policy Development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/eop/dpc/ |title=Domestic Policy Council |author= |date= |work=White House Administration |publisher=White House |accessdate=2010-02-26 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100226080925/http://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/eop/dpc/ |archive-date=2010-02-26 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/GOVMAN-2012-12-07/xml/GOVMAN-2012-12-07-108.xml |title=Domestic Policy Council|author= |date=2012-12-07 |work=US Government Manual |publisher=Government Printing Office |accessdate=2013-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;
