== Background ==
Air pollution is of concern in Europe because it may impair health and damage the environment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eea.europa.eu/themes/air "Air pollution."] European Environment Agency. Accessed 20 February 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Long term exposure to air polluted with fine particles in Europe, especially that from proximity to [[traffic]], is associated with deaths from [[natural causes]] and [[low birth weight]] (but not necessarily with non-[[malignant]] [[respiratory]] deaths).&lt;ref name=pmid24332274&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(13)62158-3 |pmid=24332274 |title=Effects of long-term exposure to air pollution on natural-cause mortality: An analysis of 22 European cohorts within the multicentre ESCAPE project |journal=The Lancet |volume=383 |issue=9919 |pages=785–95 |year=2014 |last1=Beelen |first1=Rob |last2=Raaschou-Nielsen |first2=Ole |last3=Stafoggia |first3=Massimo |last4=Andersen |first4=Zorana Jovanovic |last5=Weinmayr |first5=Gudrun |last6=Hoffmann |first6=Barbara |last7=Wolf |first7=Kathrin |last8=Samoli |first8=Evangelia |last9=Fischer |first9=Paul |last10=Nieuwenhuijsen |first10=Mark |last11=Vineis |first11=Paolo |last12=Xun |first12=Wei W |last13=Katsouyanni |first13=Klea |last14=Dimakopoulou |first14=Konstantina |last15=Oudin |first15=Anna |last16=Forsberg |first16=Bertil |last17=Modig |first17=Lars |last18=Havulinna |first18=Aki S |last19=Lanki |first19=Timo |last20=Turunen |first20=Anu |last21=Oftedal |first21=Bente |last22=Nystad |first22=Wenche |last23=Nafstad |first23=Per |last24=De Faire |first24=Ulf |last25=Pedersen |first25=Nancy L |last26=Östenson |first26=Claes-Göran |last27=Fratiglioni |first27=Laura |last28=Penell |first28=Johanna |last29=Korek |first29=Michal |last30=Pershagen |first30=Göran |display-authors=29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the EU, it is estimated to cost the healthcare system 1 million euros per year (nine percent of the EU [[Gross Domestic Product]] (GDP).{{citation needed|date=February 2014}} and 2.2 million [[disability-adjusted life years]] (''DALYs'') are lost due to poor indoor air quality; it is estimated that 30% of those who spend a majority of their time within EU buildings suffer from [[Sick Building Syndrome]] (SBS).{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}

Although, from a global perspective, harmful indoor air pollution is caused by cooking and heating with solid fuels on open fires or traditional stoves, especially in poorly ventilated rooms,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.who.int/indoorair/en/ "Indoor air pollution."] WHO website 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; indoor air pollutants may also come from heating and cooling equipment, electronic appliances, cleaning products, air fresheners, insecticides, and construction materials. {{citation needed|date=February 2014}}

Accurately determining risk associated with exposure to indoor air pollution and controlling indoor air quality with regulatory instruments is difficult. Audits of [[Indoor Air Quality]] (IAQ) may assist in lessening risk to the health of people, help to improve productivity and support the use energy efficiency equipment and methods in buildings. {{citation needed|date=February 2014}} To meet these goals, the [[European Commission]]'s (EC) [[Scientific Committee on Health and Environmental Risks]] (SCHER) ruled that the EU should conduct a comprehensive review of existing data on pollutants of indoor air and begin recording data in a [[database]].

== Difficulties in the IAQ audit process ==
AIRLOG proposed to make a [[web-based]] audit management platform that would make audits less expensive, more accurate and easier to understand. The platform would include a [[Decision Support System]] that would use previously entered data to determine actions in improving IAQ that would eventually become [[best practice]]. The platform would also take into consideration the need for [[sustainable building design]], efficient use of energy and other ''[[green]]'' elements.&lt;ref name="cordis.europa.eu"/&gt;

An audit of IAQ is not a simple process for a number of reasons. The assessment must include measures of factors such as inefficient heating and air conditioning, growth of mould in moist areas, and the presence of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) from cleaning agents and objects such as new furniture. The IAQ audit may encounter unknown variables that influence its cost, time, and accuracy. In addition, each building is different in size, configuration, and exposure to air pollutants. The creation of an accurate IAQ audit must come from the combined efforts of engineers, chemists, health professionals, architects, building managers, maintenance personnel, building owners and consumers. IAQ auditors need to be trained and accredited in order to give a building an official certification.

== Elements of an IAQ audit ==
An IAC audit can be divided into two parts. One part is about the level of comfort experienced in a building and the other is about measures of IAQ. Levels of comfort in a building are determined by factors such as temperature, humidity, air velocity, air renewal, and ventilation pressure. The second part, the IAQ, is determined by factors such as inorganic toxic gases, VOCs, particulate matter (PM10), electromagnetic fields and radiation, and microbiological contaminants ([[fungi]] and [[bacteria]] such as [[Legionella]]).

The audit is taken in steps. An initial assessment involves the collecting of information about the building and its ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC); its critical points; and its possible sources of contamination. This is done through visual inspection. Then, there is the standardised measurement and analysis of factors such as certain chemicals and microbes. This is done by collecting samples for laboratory analysis. A third step is researching possible corrective actions.

== Problems to overcome ==
AIRLOG aimed to create software to assist field engineers in audits of IAQ in buildings in the EU. It also aimed to develop an integrated management platform that could become more effective as data was entered. Thus, testing of IAQ in an individual building would be aligned with the monitoring of IAQ across the EU.

The problems in IAQ auditing that were to be overcome included: inefficient planning of audits, overdue reports, incompleteness, lack of transparency in reporting audit progress and slow accumulation of results for monitoring. They also included: risk of errors due to manual data entry, the generation of unreliable alerts, bulk data loss from [[Microsoft Excel|Excel]] files and paper-based documents, delay or failure to implement the necessary corrective actions, and non-standardized auditing practices by building type, use and state. In addition, AIRLOG was challenged with considering the efficient use of energy &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.efanet.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/THADEReport.pdf "THADE report."] Efanet website.&lt;/ref&gt; and the training of IAQ experts in standard methodologies.

== Sources and use of data ==
AIRLOG aimed to integrate a number of data sources. These included: measurements from sensors; laboratory analysis; maintenance reports from building managers; and governmental and legislative decisions. AIRLOG planned to manage these sources of data using a platform based on [[Web 3.0]]. The platform would use [[artificial intelligence]] to automatically learn and propose actions for mitigation and control through the use of a risk simulation tool.

== Legal framework ==
In its resolution of 4 September 2008, relating to the mid-term review of the European Agency for Health and Action Plan 2004–2010 (2007/2252 (INI)), the European parliament called on the EC to propose directives to address the following:
:"Special attention to those vulnerable groups most susceptible to pollutants, by introducing measures to reduce exposure to indoor environmental contaminants in schools and health centres through the adoption of good practices to manage the quality of indoor air; specific measures on indoor air quality, to establish a high level of health protection and internal security, in particular...regarding construction products, to propose measures to increase energy efficiency of buildings and for the security and safety of chemicals used in equipment and furnishings; and minimum requirements for newly constructed buildings, to ensure adequate indoor air quality."

The resolution recommended that the EC encourage member states to improve IAQ through tax and other financial concessions and to reduce exposure to [[electromagnetic radiation]] in official buildings. Action 12 of the EU Environment and Health Action Plan 2004–2012 called for the development of ways to address factors affecting IAQ such as moisture, mould, building materials, consumer products, and indoor activities. Special focus would be placed on the IAQ of buildings used by people most at risk, the young, the sick and the elderly, for example schools and health centres.

== Economic impact ==
In June 2010, an EU conference, "Product Policy and Indoor Air Quality", concluded that attention to IAQ would improve work performance, reduce absenteeism and reduce need for medical care and therefore have economic impact. Furthermore, the standardised testing, certification and labelling of indoor products that gave VOC emissions would facilitate international trade and reduce trade barriers within the 28 EU member states.

'''Archbald Pothole State Park''' is a {{convert|149.16|acre|adj=on}} [[List of Pennsylvania state parks|Pennsylvania state park]] in [[Archbald, Pennsylvania|Archbald]], [[Lackawanna County, Pennsylvania|Lackawanna County]], [[Pennsylvania]]. The focal point of the park is Archbald Pothole. The [[Giant's kettle|pothole]] is a remnant of the [[Wisconsin Glacial Period]], {{convert|38|ft|1}} deep with a largest diameter of {{convert|42|ft|1}} by {{convert|24|ft|1}}. It has drawn tourists since just after it was discovered in 1884. Archbald Pothole State Park is on [[U.S. Route 6 Business (Scranton, Pennsylvania)|U.S. Route 6 Business]] in the [[borough]] of Archbald.

==History==
A [[coal miner]], Patrick Mahon, discovered Archbald Pothole in 1884. Mahon was extending a mine shaft.  When he set off a blast of [[explosives]], water and stones came pouring into the mine shaft.  He and the other miners fled the scene fearing for their lives.  The manager of the mining company, Edward Jones, came to investigate. Jones ordered that the area be cleared of the fallen debris. Almost 1,000&amp;nbsp;[[ton]]s of small rounded stones were removed and Jones soon realized that the vertical tunnel discovered by the coal miners, was a large [[Giant's kettle|pothole]].&lt;ref name="apsp"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.dcnr.state.pa.us/stateparks/findapark/archbaldpothole/index.htm| title = Archbald Pothole State Park | accessdate = October 25, 2006
| publisher = Pennsylvania Department of Conservation and Natural Resources }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After serving as a ventilation shaft for the mine, the pothole was fenced in by the owner of the land, Colonel Hackley, for tourists to look at it. The pothole soon became a renowned tourist attraction. Edward Jones led the tours for the locals and famous [[geologist]]s. Archbald Pothole was turned over to public ownership in 1914, when the [[widow]] of Colonel Hackley deeded {{convert|1|acre|m2|adj=on}} surrounding the pothole to the Lackawanna Historical Society. [[Lackawanna County, Pennsylvania|Lackawanna County]] gained ownership of the pothole and the surrounding {{convert|150|acre}} in 1940. Archbald Pothole was a county park until 1961 when the property was transferred to the [[Commonwealth of Pennsylvania]]. Archbald Pothole State Park was formally opened in 1964.&lt;ref name="apsp"/&gt;

While the pothole and surrounding park were long a popular tourist attraction, by the 1990s attendance had fallen and the facilities were in need of repair. The park was closed for a $170,000 "facelift" and when it reopened in 1997 it had been repaved and had new landscaping and new trash receptacles.&lt;ref name="ny times"&gt;{{cite news | url = https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0DE1DF1538F930A15754C0A9649C8B63&amp;scp=1&amp;sq=Archbald+Pothole&amp;st=nyt |title = National Briefing: Mid-Atlantic: Pennsylvania: A Money Pit |date = July 23, 2002 |accessdate = April 8, 2008 |work=[[The New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="amarillo"&gt;{{cite news | url = http://amarillo.com/stories/080202/usn_pothole.shtml |title = Biggest pothole falls on hard times |date = August 2, 2002 |accessdate = April 7, 2008 |publisher = [[Amarillo Globe-News]] / [[Associated Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the improvements, attendance remained low and litter thrown into the pothole was still a problem, including "bottles and paper bags... a parking meter, a park bench and a "Wet Floor" cone".&lt;ref name = "amarillo"/&gt; Another problem was the park's "unsavory reputation" as a place for "men looking for sex", with plainclothes police arresting 29 men there for "lewd behavior" in one 2002 sweep.&lt;ref name = "amarillo"/&gt; In an attempt to address these issues, in 2002 the Pennsylvania State Legislature approved more improvements to the park, including "least two soccer fields, a basketball court, a tennis court, a walking trail, a playground, roads and parking areas".&lt;ref name = "amarillo"/&gt;

==Geology==
Archbald Pothole is {{convert|38|ft|1}} deep and {{convert|42|ft|1}} wide at its maximum [[diameter]]. The pothole cuts through layers of [[sandstone]], [[shale]] and [[coal]]. A pothole, in geologic terms, is a hole that is worn into the [[bedrock]] of a stream in strong [[rapids]] or at the base of a [[waterfall]].  The force of the water spins rock fragments, sand and gravel into a small indentation in the bedrock. After years and years of constant spinning, the stones and sands carve out an elliptical hole. Potholes are also formed by the action of [[Glacier|glacial]] meltwater. Archbald Pothole is an example of just such a pothole.&lt;ref name="apspgeology"&gt;{{ cite web 
| url = http://www.dcnr.state.pa.us/topogeo/pnhp/archbald.aspx | title = Geologic Survey | accessdate = October 25, 2006 | publisher = Pennsylvania Department of Conservation and Natural Resources}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Archbald Pothole was formed during the [[Wisconsin glaciation|Wisconsin Glacial Period]]. As the glacier melted, a stream that flowed on top may have fallen into a crevasse and then fell to the bedrock.  The force of the falling water created a pothole in much the same way that a [[waterfall]] creates a pothole. The pothole was filled by falling sand, rocks and gravel as the glacier retreated and created other potholes. Archbald Pothole was preserved underground for nearly 13,000 years until its discovery by Patrick Mahon.&lt;ref name="apspgeology"/&gt; The park is at an elevation of {{convert|1211|ft}}.&lt;ref name="gnis"&gt;{{cite web

==Recreation==
[[File:Archbald Pothole State Park Sign.jpg|thumb|Park entrance sign]]
A small loop trail follows an old coal mine tram road for hiking. The trail passes along a rock ledge and through a forest.&lt;ref name="apsp"/&gt;

Hunting is permitted on over {{convert|100|acre}} of the park. The most common game species are [[eastern gray squirrel|squirrels]], [[wild turkey|turkeys]] and [[white-tailed deer]]. The hunting of [[groundhog]]s is not permitted. Hunters are expected to follow the rules and regulations of the Pennsylvania State Game Commission.&lt;ref name="apsp"/&gt;

Some of the parkland was stripped off in the past by [[strip mining]]. This land is currently undergoing a reclamation process and there are plans to use the reclaimed land for recreation and to build athletic fields.&lt;ref name="apsp"/&gt;

'''''BLIZZARD! The Storm That Changed America''''' is a 2000 Children's history book by [[Jim Murphy (author)|Jim Murphy]]. It is about [[Great Blizzard of 1888|the Blizzard of 1888]] that hit the north-east of [[North America]], and concentrates on [[New York City]].

==Reception==
''[[BookList]]'' called ''Blizzard'' "an example of stellar nonfiction."&lt;ref name=buffalo/&gt; and the ''[[School Library Journal]]'' wrote "The narrative is a readable and seamless blend of history and adventure adapted from extensive first-person accounts and primary news sources. .. The text is exciting without being melodramatic .. Authentic photographs, drawings, and maps that demonstrate the course of the storm, all done in the same sepia tone as the text, perfectly illustrate the book. Overall, a superb piece of writing and history."&lt;ref name=buffalo&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.buffalolib.org/vufind/Record/1094682/Reviews#tabnav |title=Blizzard!: the storm that changed America |website=Buffalo and Erie County Public Library |accessdate=November 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a star review ''[[Kirkus Reviews]]'' wrote "Murphy’s ability to pull in details that lend context allows him to tell this story of a place in time through the lens of a single, dramatic episode that will engage readers. This is skillfully done: humorous, jaw-dropping, thought-provoking, and chilling."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/jim-murphy/blizzard/ |title=BLIZZARD! The Storm That Changed America  |date=November 15, 2000|website=Kirkus Reviews |publisher=Kirkus Media LLC |accessdate=November 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a review of an audio version of the book ''[[Publishers Weekly]]'' wrote "Murphy's well-rounded information about the various circumstances that worsened the effects of the storm make the tale both more fascinating and more tragic. Mali's (Taylor Mali, the reader) steady delivery is very well suited to the material; it allows listeners time to absorb this gripping history lesson."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/978-1-883332-85-3 |title=BLIZZARD! The Storm That Changed America |date= |website=Publishers Weekly |publisher=PWxyz LLC|accessdate=November 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Horn Book Magazine]]'' stated "Murphy treats his subject with respect as he curbs the inherent sensationalism of the topic through an informal, journalistic style. To build urgency in the narrative, he creates cogent transitions from one event to another and from personal events to broader historical segments. Even with all of these connections, individual chapters stand alone, providing access for browsers and those searching for nonfiction read-alouds. Sepia-colored illustrations (archival photographs and original art from the period) reinforce the historical setting .."&lt;ref name=WCCLS/&gt; and ''[[Voice of Youth Advocates]]'' wrote "this first annual Sibert Award honor book will appeal to both teens and adults interested in weather extremes and history."&lt;ref name=WCCLS&gt;{{cite web |url=https://catalog.wccls.org/Mobile/BakerAndTaylor/Review?ISBN=0590673092&amp;UPC=0590673092&amp;position=1 |title=Reviews |website=wccls.org |accessdate=November 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a review for ''[[The New York Times]]'', Mary Russell wrote "Murphy's gift for dealing with disasters .. is that he manages to make them, simultaneously, both larger than we'd thought and smaller, more human than we'd imagined."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Mary Harris Russell |date=November 19, 2000 |title=Snow Day |url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/00/11/19/reviews/001119.19russelt.html |newspaper=The New York Times |accessdate=November 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Blackwater River State Park''' is a [[Florida State Parks|Florida State Park]] located fifteen miles northeast of [[Milton, Florida|Milton]], near [[Harold, Florida|Harold]], off [[U.S. Route 90 in Florida|U.S. 90]]. The address is 7720 Deaton Bridge Road.

==History==
A favorite destination for canoeists and kayakers, Blackwater River offers opportunities for a variety of outdoor recreation. The river is one of the purest sand-bottom rivers in the nation, making this park a popular place for swimming, fishing, camping, and paddling. Shaded campsites are just a short walk from the river, and visitors can enjoy a picnic at a pavilion overlooking the river. Nature enthusiasts will enjoy strolling along trails through undisturbed natural communities. The park was certified a [[Registered State Natural Feature]] in 1980, for possessing exceptional value in illustrating the natural history of Florida. In 1982, an [[Chamaecyparis thyoides|Atlantic white cedar]] there was recognized as a Florida Champion tree, one of the largest and oldest of its species.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.floridastateparks.org/blackwaterriver/default.cfm Blackwater River State Park article] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060708034245/http://www.floridastateparks.org/blackwaterriver/default.cfm |date=July 8, 2006 }} on the [http://www.floridastateparks.org/ Florida State Park website]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recreational activities==
The park has such amenities as [[birding]], [[boating]], [[canoeing]], [[fishing]], [[hiking]], [[kayaking]], [[picnic]]king areas, [[human swimming|swimming]], [[Tubing (recreation)|tubing]], [[wildlife]] viewing and full [[camping]] facilities.  The main picnicking area has covered picnicking pavilions, restrooms, and a spacious parking lot. Bring your tubes and enjoy a leisurely float down the river to the Deaton Bridge.  It is a short 1 mile hike back to the parking lot to retrieve your vehicle.  Very kid friendly park with a variety of areas for swimming.

'''Chemical cycling''' describes systems of repeated circulation of chemicals between other compounds, states and materials, and back to their original state, that occurs in space, and on many objects in space including the Earth. Active chemical cycling is known to occur in stars, many planets and natural satellites.

Chemical cycling plays a large role in sustaining planetary atmospheres, liquids and biological processes and can greatly influence weather and climate. Some chemical cycles release [[renewable energy]], others may give rise to complex chemical reactions, organic compounds and [[Prebiotic (chemistry)|prebiotic chemistry]]. On terrestrial bodies such as the Earth, chemical cycles involving the [[lithosphere]] are known as [[geochemical cycle]]s. Ongoing geochemical cycles are one of the main attributes of geologically active worlds. A chemical cycle involving a biosphere is known as a [[biogeochemical cycle]].

== The Sun, other stars and star systems ==
In most hydrogen-fusing stars, including the [[Sun]], a chemical cycle involved in stellar nucleosynthesis occurs which is known as a carbon-nitrogen-oxygen or ([[CNO cycle]]). In addition to this cycle, stars also have a helium cycle.&lt;ref name="Fortov2015"&gt;{{cite book|author=Vladimir E.

[[Image:Water cycle.png|thumb|320px|right|Earth's [[water cycle]].]]
A number of different types of chemical cycles geochemical cycles occur on Earth. Biogeochemical cycles play an important role in sustaining the biosphere.
Notable active chemical cycles on Earth include:

* [[Carbon cycle]] – consisting of an [[atmospheric carbon cycle]] (and carbon dioxide cycle), [[terrestrial biological carbon cycle]], [[oceanic carbon cycle]] and [[Carbon sink|geological carbon cycle]]
* [[Nitrogen cycle]] – which converts nitrogen between its forms through  [[nitrogen fixation|fixation]], [[ammonification]], [[nitrification]], and [[denitrification]]
* [[Oxygen cycle]] and [[Ozone–oxygen cycle]] – a [[biogeochemical cycle]]  of circulating oxygen between the atmosphere, [[biosphere]] (the global sum of all ecosystems), and the lithosphere
* [[Ozone-oxygen cycle]] – continually regenerates ozone in the atmosphere and converts [[Ultraviolet|ultraviolet radiation]] (UV) into heat
* [[Water cycle]] – moves water continuously on, above and below the surface shifting between states of liquid, solution, ice and vapour
* [[Methane cycle]] – moves methane between geological and biogeochemical sources and reactions in the atmosphere
* [[Hydrogen cycle]] – a biogeochemical cycle brought about by a combination of biological and abiological processes
* [[Phosphorus cycle]] – the movement of phosphorus through the lithosphere, hydrosphere, and biosphere
* [[Sulfur cycle]] – a biogeochemical process resulting form the mineralization of organic sulfur, oxidation, reduction and incorporation into organic compounds
* [[Carbonate–silicate cycle]] transforms [[silicate]] rocks to [[Carbonate rock|carbonate]] rocks by [[weathering]] and [[sedimentation]] and transforms carbonate rocks back into silicates by [[metamorphism]] and [[magmatism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://shadow.eas.gatech.edu/~jean/paleo/Berner_1983.pdf|title = The Carbonate-Silicate Geochemical Cycle and its Effect on Atmospheric Carbon Dioxide over the Past 100 Million Years|last = Berner|first = Robert|date = September 1983|journal = American Journal of Science|doi = 10.2475/ajs.283.7.641|pmid = |access-date = Feb 3, 2015|first2 = Antonio|last2 = Lasaga|volume = 283|issue = 7|pages = 641–683|last3 = Garrels|first3 = Robert|bibcode = 1983AmJS..283..641B|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160326032613/http://shadow.eas.gatech.edu/~jean/paleo/Berner_1983.pdf#|archive-date = 2016-03-26|dead-url = yes|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Rock cycle]] – switches rock between its three forms: sedimentary, metamorphic, and igneous
* [[Mercury cycle]] – a biogeochemical process in which naturally occurring mercury is bioaccumulated before recombining with sulfur and returning to geological sources as sediments

Other chemical cycles include [[hydrogen peroxide]].&lt;ref name="AllenGonzález Abad2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Allen|first1=Nicholas D.C.|last2=González Abad|first2=Gonzalo|last3=Bernath|first3=Peter F.|last4=Boone|first4=Chris D.|title=Satellite observations of the global distribution of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) from ACE|journal=Journal of Quantitative Spectroscopy and Radiative Transfer|volume=115|year=2013|pages=66–77|issn=0022-4073|doi=10.1016/j.jqsrt.2012.09.008|bibcode = 2013JQSRT.115...66A }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:PIA19088-MarsCuriosityRover-MethaneSource-20141216.png|thumb|Possible sources of a hypothesized [[Atmosphere of Mars#Methane|Martian Methane]] cycle.]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2049">An '''eachy''' is a name given to a species of [[lake monster]] from a variety of locations in [[Northern England]] and Scotland. An eachy is typically a large humanoid being of gruesome and slimy appearance seen to occasionally emerge from the lake. An eachy was reported from [[Windermere]] in 1873 and [[Bassenthwaite Lake]] as late as 1973 when it was supposedly photographed twice.&lt;ref&gt;http://home.online.no/~jackobse/gunnar/engl1973/bassthwt.html&lt;/ref&gt; A scientific expedition was launched to find the mystery creature when, in September 1961, three atomic scientists conducted an underwater exploration of the lake. However, they did not find the {{convert|13|ft|m|adj=mid|-long}}, triple-humped, python-headed creature that had recently been sighted.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1300&amp;dat=19610912&amp;id=3aQUAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=5qwDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4018,1662544]&lt;/ref&gt;

Presumably the name comes from the [[Middle English]] "iker" or "eker" (from the older "niker", from the [[Old English language|Old English]] "nicor", meaning "water-sprite" or "hippotamus"&lt;ref&gt;'Middle English Dictionary' By Hans Kurath&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;'A Concise Dictionary of Middle English: From A. D. 1150 To 1580' By A. L. Mayhew, Mayhew, A.L. &amp; Skeat, Walter W., Walter W. Skeat&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=nixie&lt;/ref&gt;), which was a type of sea monster. Although the name looks similar to the [[Scottish Gaelic]] [[each-uisge]], the word is morphologically and phonetically dissimilar. The area of the each-uisge is traditionally quite distant from the traditional area of the eachy and the each-uisge was not anthropomorphic but instead a water horse.

An '''emergent organization''' (alternatively '''emergent organisation''') is an [[organization]] that spontaneously [[emergence|emerges]] from and exists in a complex dynamic [[natural environment|environment]] or [[market place]], rather than being a construct or copy of something that already exists. The term first appeared in the late 1990s and was the topic of the Seventh Annual Washington [[Evolutionary Systems]] Conference at [[University of Ghent]], [[Belgium]] in May, 1999. Emergent organizations and their dynamics pose interesting questions; for example, how does such an organization achieve closure and stability?

Alternatively, [[James R. Taylor]] wrote in 2000 his seminal book, ''The Emergent Organization'', where he suggests that all organizations emerge from communication, especially from the interplay of conversation and text. This idea concerns human organizations, but is consistent with [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]] or [[Gabriel Tarde]]'s [[monadology]], or with [[Alfred North Whitehead]]'s [[process philosophy]], which explains the macro—both in human and non-human "societies"—from the processes taking place between its constituent parts.

'''GPlates''' is [[open-source software|open-source]] [[application software]] offering a novel combination of interactive [[Plate tectonics|plate-tectonic]] reconstructions, [[geographic information system]] (GIS) functionality and raster data visualization.

==History ==
The GPlates project was started by Professor [http://sydney.edu.au/science/people/dietmar.muller.php Dietmar Müller] in 2006. By the end of 2010, the GPlates 1.0.0 was released.

The latest release was GPlates 2.0 in November 2016. A user manual and tutorials are available online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sites.google.com/site/gplatestutorials/|title=GPlates Tutorials|date=|publisher=Sites.google.com|accessdate=2015-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gplates.org/docs.html|title=GPlates User Manual|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Below is a list of major releases of GPlates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gplates.org/news.html | title=GPlates News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Functionality==
[[File:GPlates volcanoes.png|thumb|Screenshot of volcanoes in GPlates 1.5.0]]
GPlates enables both the visualization and the manipulation of plate-tectonic reconstructions and associated data through geological time:
* Load and save geological, geographic and tectonic feature data.
* Assign feature data to tectonic plates.
* Reconstruct feature data to past geological times.
* Query and edit feature properties and geometries.
* Modify reconstructions graphically.
* Visualize vector and raster data on the globe or in one of the map projections.
* Visualize sub-surface 3D scalar fields as isosurfaces or 2D cross-sections.
* Export reconstructed data as a time-sequence of exported files.
* Use plate polygons (with dynamic boundaries and deformation) to calculate velocity fields.

==Contributors==
GPlates is developed by an international team of scientists and professional software developers at:
* the [https://www.earthbyte.org/ EarthByte group] in the school of Geosciences at the [[University of Sydney]]
* the [http://www.gps.caltech.edu/ Division of Geological and Planetary Sciences (GPS)] at Caltech
* the [http://www.mn.uio.no/ceed/english/ Centre for Earth Evolution and Dynamics (CEED)] at the [http://www.mn.uio.no/geo/english/ Department of Geosciences], University of Oslo, Norway
* the [http://www.geodynamics.no/ Geodynamics Team] at the [[Norwegian Geological Survey|Geological Survey of Norway (NGU)]]

== Adoption ==
GPlates is used by geophysicists, students and researchers in academic institutions, government departments and industry.

==Implementation==
GPlates runs on [[Mac OS X]], [[Microsoft Windows]] and [[Ubuntu (operating system)|Ubuntu]]. GPlates is written in [[C++]] and uses [[OpenGL]] to render its 3D globe and 2D [[Map projection|map]] views. It uses [[Qt (software)|Qt]] as a GUI framework. The [[Boost (C++ libraries)|Boost]] C++ library has also been widely used. Other libraries include [[GDAL]], [[CGAL]], [[proj]], [[qwt]] and [[GLEW]].

===Information Model===

====GPGIM and GPML====
GPlates uses the [http://www.gplates.org/docs/gpgim/ GPlates Geological Information Model] (GPGIM) to represent geological data in a [[Plate tectonics]] context. The [http://www.gplates.org/gpml.html GPlates Markup Language] (GPML) is an XML implementation of the GPGIM&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geosci-instrum-method-data-syst.net/1/111/2012/gi-1-111-2012.html |title=GI - Abstract - The GPlates Geological Information Model and Markup Language |publisher=Geosci-instrum-method-data-syst.net |date= |accessdate=2015-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; derived from the [[Geography Markup Language]] (GML).

===GPlates Python Binding===
The GPlates Python library ('''pyGPlates''') enables access to GPlates functionality via the Python programming language. It allows users to use GPlates in a programmatic way and hence provides much more flexibility than the GPlates desktop interface can offer. The first beta release of pyGPlates is available for [http://www.gplates.org/download.html download]. Reference documentation and tutorials are also available for [http://www.gplates.org/docs.html download].

The '''Geological Survey of Denmark and Greenland''' ({{lang-da|Danmarks og Grønlands Geologiske Undersøgelse, GEUS}}) is the independent [[Sector research institutes of Denmark|sector research institute]] under the Danish [[Ministry of Climate and Energy (Denmark)|Ministry of Climate and Energy]].  GEUS is an advisory, research and survey institute in [[hydrogeology]], [[geophysics]], [[geochemistry]], [[stratigraphy]], [[glaciology]], [[ore geology]], [[marine geology]], [[mineralogy]], [[climatology]], environmental history, air photo [[wikt:interpretation|interpretation]], [[geothermal energy]] fields concerning [[Denmark]] and [[Greenland]].

GEUS works in close corporation with [[Geologisk Institut]] and [[Geologisk Museum]], both part of [[University of Copenhagen]].

It publishes a service paper called ''Greenland Hydrocarbon Exploration Information Service''  (GHEXIS) and a newsletter called Greenland Mineral Exploration Newsletter  (MINEX) in co-operation with the [[Bureau of Minerals and Petroleum]] (Råstofdirektoratet), a secretariat for the Joint Committee on Mineral Resources under Greenland’s home rule.

==History==
In 1888 {{lang|da|Danmarks Geologiske Undersøgelse}} (DGU) was founded{{by whom?|date=January 2015}}. 

In 1946, {{lang|da|Grønlands Geologiske Undersøgelse}} was created.  

On 14 June 1965, law no. 238 created GGU.

On 23 December 1987, law no. 864 merged GGU into DGU, changing its name to DGGU ({{lang|da|Danmarks og Grønlands Geologiske Undersøgelse}}).

On 14 June 1995, Law no. 408  disbanded law no. 238. 

On 20 December 1995, law no. 1076 concerning Danish sector research institutes created GEUS by merging DGU and GGU.

'''Johann Georg Adam Forster''' ({{IPA-de|ˈɡeːɔʁk ˈfɔʁstɐ}}; November 27, 1754&lt;ref name="birthdate"&gt;Many sources, including the biography by Thomas Saine, give Forster's birth date as November 26; according to Enzensberger, Ulrich (1996) ''Ein Leben in Scherben [A Life in Ruins]'', Deutscher Taschenbuch Verlag, {{ISBN|3-423-13248-5}}, the [[baptism]] registry of St Peter in [[Gdańsk|Danzig]] lists November 27 as the date of birth and December 5 as the date of baptism.&lt;/ref&gt; – January 10, 1794) was a [[Germans|German]] [[natural history|naturalist]], [[ethnology|ethnologist]], [[travel literature|travel writer]], journalist, and revolutionary.&lt;ref name="spiegel"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gutenberg.spiegel.de/autor/georg-forster-174| language=de |title=Georg Forster Leben und Werk |publisher=''[[Spiegel Online]]'' |accessdate=23 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; At an early age, he accompanied his father, [[Johann Reinhold Forster]], on several scientific expeditions, including [[James Cook]]'s [[Second voyage of James Cook|second voyage]] to the [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]]. His report of that journey, ''A Voyage Round the World'', contributed significantly to the ethnology of the people of [[Polynesia]] and remains a respected work. As a result of the report, Forster was admitted to the [[Royal Society]] at the early age of twenty-two and came to be considered one of the founders of modern scientific travel literature.

After returning to continental Europe, Forster turned toward academia. He traveled to Paris to seek out a discussion with the American revolutionary [[Benjamin Franklin]] in 1777.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://harpers.org/blog/2008/04/georg-forsters-recollection-of-benjamin-franklin/|title = Georg Forster's Recollection of Benjamin Franklin|date = April 13, 2008|accessdate = May 8, 2015|work = Harper's Magazine|last1 = Horton|first1 = Scott}}&lt;/ref&gt; He taught natural history at the [[Collegium Carolinum (Kassel)|Collegium Carolinum]] in the [[Ottoneum]], [[Kassel]] (1778–84), and later at the [[Vilnius University|Academy of Vilna (Vilnius University)]] (1784–87). In 1788, he became [[librarian|head librarian]] at the [[University of Mainz]]. Most of his scientific work during this time consisted of essays on [[botany]] and ethnology, but he also prefaced and translated many books about travel and exploration, including a German translation of Cook's diaries.

Forster was a central figure of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] in Germany, and corresponded with most of its adherents, including his close friend [[Georg Christoph Lichtenberg]]. His ideas and personality influenced [[Alexander von Humboldt]], one of the great scientists of the 19th century. When the French took control of [[Mainz]] in 1792, Forster became one of the founders of the city's [[Jacobin Club]] and went on to play a leading role in the [[Mainz Republic]], the earliest [[republicanism|republican]] state in Germany. During July 1793 and while he was in Paris as a delegate of the young Mainz Republic, [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussian]] and [[Habsburg Monarchy|Austrian]] coalition forces regained control of the city and Forster was declared an outlaw. Unable to return to Germany and separated from his friends and family, he died in Paris of illness in early 1794.

==Early life==
Georg Forster was born in the small village of [[Mokry Dwór, Pomeranian Voivodeship|Nassenhuben (Mokry Dwór)]] near [[Danzig]] (Gdańsk), in the region of [[Royal Prussia]], in the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Other Prussia: Royal Prussia, Poland and Liberty, 1569–1772|last = Friedrich|first = Karin|publisher = Cambridge University Press|year = 2000|isbn = 978-0-521-58335-0|location = |page = xi}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was the oldest of seven surviving children of [[Johann Reinhold Forster]] and Justina Elisabeth (née Nicolai). His father was a naturalist, scientist and [[Reformed churches|Reformed]] pastor. In 1765, the [[Russian Empire|Russian]] [[tsarina|empress]] [[Catherine II of Russia|Catherine II]] commissioned the pastor to travel through Russia on a research journey and investigate the situation of a [[Volga German|German colony]] on the [[Volga River]]. Georg, then ten years old, joined him. On the journey, which reached the [[Kalmykia|Kalmyk]] [[steppe]] on the lower Volga, they discovered several new species,&lt;ref name="intro"&gt;{{cite book |others=Forster, Georg|title=A Voyage Round the World|first1=Nicholas|last1=Thomas |first2=Oliver|last2=Berghof |year=2000 |publisher=University of Hawai'i Press |isbn=0-8248-2091-6 |contribution=Introduction}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the young Forster learned how to conduct scientific research and practice [[cartography]]. He also became fluent in Russian.

The report of the journey, which included sharp criticism of the governor of [[Saratov]], was not well received at court. The Forsters claimed they had not received fair payment for their work&lt;ref&gt;Reintjes, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; and had to move house. They chose to settle in England in 1766. The father took up teaching at the [[Dissenter]]'s Academy in [[Warrington]]&lt;ref name="boreham"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Boreham|first=Ian|title=John Reinhold Forster|journal=Cook's Log|publisher=Captain Cook Society|year=1985|volume=8|issue=3|page=368|url=http://www.captaincooksociety.com/home/detail/john-reinhold-forster}}&lt;/ref&gt; and also translation work. At the age of only thirteen, the young Forster published his first book: an English translation of [[Mikhail Lomonosov|Lomonosov]]'s history of Russia, which was well received in scientific circles.&lt;ref name="Voegel"&gt;{{cite book|editor-last1=Steiner|editor-first1=Gerhard|editor-last2=Baege|editor-first2=Ludwig|title=Vögel der Südsee|trans-title=Birds of the South Seas|publisher=Insel-Verlag|year=1971|page=53|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Around the world with Captain Cook==
[[File:Captainjamescookportrait.jpg|thumb|left|upright|James Cook, portrait by Nathaniel Dance, c. 1775, [[National Maritime Museum]], Greenwich]]

In 1772, Forster's father became a member of the [[Royal Society]]. This and the withdrawal of [[Joseph Banks]]&lt;!-- cite; expand?--&gt; resulted in his invitation by the [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]] [[admiralty]] to join [[James Cook]]'s [[Second voyage of James Cook|second expedition]] to the [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]] (1772–75). Georg Forster joined his father in the expedition again and was appointed as a [[technical drawing|draughtsman]] to his father. Johann Reinhold Forster's task was to work on a scientific report of the journey's discoveries that was to be published after their return.&lt;ref name="AtHome"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Aulie |first1=Richard P. |author-link=Richard P. Aulie |date=1999 |title=The Voyages of Captain James Cook |chapter-url=http://www.captaincooksociety.com/home/detail/the-forsters-at-home |location= |publisher=Captain Cook Study Unit |isbn= |access-date=May 14, 2015 |chapter=The Forsters at Home}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They embarked [[HMS Resolution (Cook)|HMS ''Resolution'']] on July 13, 1772, in [[Plymouth]]. The ship's route led first to the [[Atlantic Ocean|South Atlantic]], then through the Indian Ocean and the [[Southern Ocean]] to the islands of [[Polynesia]] and finally around [[Cape Horn]] back to England, returning on July 30, 1775. During the three-year journey, the explorers visited New Zealand, the [[Tonga]] islands, [[New Caledonia]], [[Tahiti]], the [[Marquesas Islands]] and [[Easter Island]]. They went further south than anybody before them, almost discovering [[Antarctica]]. The journey conclusively disproved the ''[[Terra Australis]] Incognita'' theory, which claimed there was a big, habitable continent in the South.&lt;ref name="intro" /&gt;

Supervised by his father, Georg Forster first undertook studies of the [[zoology]] and [[botanics]] of the southern seas, mostly by drawing animals and plants. However, Georg also pursued his own interests, which led to completely independent explorations in comparative [[geography]] and [[ethnology]]. He quickly learned the languages of the Polynesian islands. His reports on the people of Polynesia are well regarded today, as they describe the inhabitants of the southern islands with empathy, sympathy and largely without [[Western culture|Western]] or Christian bias.&lt;ref&gt;Ackerknecht, pp. 85–86&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Hodges, Resolution and Adventure in Matavai Bay.jpg|thumb|''[[HMS Resolution (Cook)|Resolution]] and [[HMS Adventure (1771)|Adventure]] in [[Matavai Bay]]'' by [[William Hodges]]]]

Unlike [[Louis Antoine de Bougainville]], whose reports from a journey to Tahiti a few years earlier had initiated uncritical ''[[noble savage]]'' romanticism, Forster developed a sophisticated picture of the societies of the South Pacific islands.&lt;ref&gt;Ackerknecht, pp. 86–87&lt;/ref&gt; He described various [[social structure]]s and religions that he encountered on the [[Society Islands]], Easter Island and in Tonga and New Zealand, and ascribed this diversity to the difference in living conditions of these people. At the same time, he also observed that the languages of these fairly widely scattered islands were similar. About the inhabitants of the [[Nomuka]] islands (in the [[Ha'apai]] island group of present-day Tonga), he wrote that their languages, vehicles, weapons, furniture, clothes, tattoos, style of beard, in short all of their being matched perfectly with what he had already seen while studying tribes on [[Tongatapu]]. However, he wrote, "we could not observe any subordination among them, though this had strongly characterised the natives of Tonga-Tabboo, who seemed to descend even to servility in their obeisance to the king."&lt;ref name="VTW TT"&gt;Forster, Georg. ''A Voyage Round the World'', Book II, Chapter VIII&lt;/ref&gt;

The journey was rich in scientific results. However, the relationship between the Forsters and Cook and his officers was often problematic, due to the elder Forster's fractious temperament&lt;ref name="intro" /&gt;&lt;!-- it would be great to have some quotes from Michael Hoare: "The Tactless Philosopher", a bio of JR Forster--&gt; as well as Cook's refusal to allow more time for botanical and other scientific observation. Cook refused scientists on his third journey after his experiences with the Forsters.&lt;ref&gt;Saine, p. 22&lt;/ref&gt;

==Founder of modern travel literature==
[[File:TannaGroundDove.jpg|thumb|One of Forster's many illustrations of birds now extinct, the [[Tanna ground dove]], also known as Forster's dove of Tanna]] 
These conflicts continued after the journey with the problem of who should write the official account of the travels. [[John Montagu, 4th Earl of Sandwich|Lord Sandwich]], although willing to pay the promised money, was irritated with Johann Reinhold Forster's opening chapter and tried to have it edited. However, Forster did not want to have his writing corrected "like a theme of a School-boy", and stubbornly refused any compromise.&lt;ref name="AtHome" /&gt; As a result, the official account was written by Cook, and the Forsters were deprived of the right to compile the account and did not obtain payment for their work. During the negotiations, the younger Forster decided to release an unofficial account of their travels. In 1777, his book ''A Voyage Round the World in His Britannic Majesty's Sloop Resolution, Commanded by Capt. James Cook, during the Years, 1772, 3, 4, and 5'' was published. This report was the first account of Cook's second voyage (it appeared six weeks before the official publication) and was intended for the general public. The English version and his own translation into German (published 1778–80) earned the young author real fame. The poet [[Christoph Martin Wieland]] praised the book as the most important one of his time, and even today it remains one of the most important journey descriptions ever written. The book also had a significant impact on German literature, culture and science, influencing such scientists as [[Alexander von Humboldt]]&lt;ref name="Smith"&gt;{{cite book |first1=Alexander|last1=Smith |title=Explorers of the Amazon |page=218 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=3VP8usYq7XEC&amp;pg=PA218 |year= 1990 |isbn= 0-226-76337-4 |publisher= University of Chicago Press }}&lt;/ref&gt; and it inspired many [[ethnology|ethnologists]] of later times.

Forster wrote well-polished German prose, which was not only scientifically accurate and objective, but also exciting and easy to read. This differed from conventional [[travel literature]] of the time, insofar as it presented more than a mere collection of data – it also demonstrated coherent, colourful and reliable [[ethnography|ethnographical]] facts that resulted from detailed and sympathetic observation. He often interrupted the description to enrich it with philosophical remarks about his observations.&lt;ref name="voyage preface"&gt;{{cite book |others=Forster, Georg|title=A Voyage Round the World|first1=Nicholas|last1=Thomas |first2=Oliver|last2=Berghof |year=2000 |publisher=University of Hawai'i Press |isbn=0-8248-2091-6 |contribution=Preface}}&lt;/ref&gt; His main focus was always on the people he encountered: their behavior, customs, habits, religions and forms of social organization. In ''A Voyage Round the World'' he even presented the songs sung by the people of [[Polynesia]], complete with lyrics and [[musical notation|notation]]. The book is one of the most important sources concerning the societies of the Southern Pacific from the times before European influence had become significant.

Both Forsters also published descriptions of their South Pacific travels in the Berlin-based ''Magazin von merkwürdigen neuen Reisebeschreibungen'' ("''Magazine of strange new travel accounts''"), and Georg published a translation of "''A Voyage to the South Sea, by Lieutenant [[William Bligh]], London 1792''" in 1791–93.

==Forster at universities==
The publication of ''A Voyage Round the World'' brought Forster scientific recognition all over Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gray|first=Sally Hatch|url=http://openinquiryarchive.net/2012/04/28/disinterested-pleasure-and-aesthetic-autonomy/ |title=Disinterested Pleasure and Aesthetic Autonomy in Georg Forster's Voyage 'round the World|journal=Open Inquiry Archive|volume=1|issue=5|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The respectable [[Royal Society]] made him a member on January 9, 1777,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.royalsoc.co.uk/downloaddoc.asp?id=778|title = Fellows of the Royal Society – F|date = |accessdate = May 8, 2015|website = |publisher = Royal Society|last = |first = |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071008133318/http://www.royalsoc.co.uk/downloaddoc.asp?id=778|archivedate = October 8, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; though he was not even 23 years old. He was granted similar titles from academies ranging from [[Berlin]] to [[Madrid]].&lt;ref name="Ronikier"&gt;{{cite book|last=Rakusa-Suszczewski|first=Stanisław|contribution=Introduction|language=Polish|others=Forster, Georg; translated by Michał Ronikier|title=Podróż naokoło świata|trans-title=Voyage Round the World|publisher=Czytelnik|year=1977}}&lt;/ref&gt; These appointments, however, were unpaid.

In 1778, he went to Germany to take a teaching position as a Natural History professor at the [[Collegium Carolinum (Kassel)|Collegium Carolinum]] in [[Kassel]], where he met [[Therese Huber|Therese Heyne]], the daughter of classicist [[Christian Gottlob Heyne]]. She later became one of the first independent female writers in Germany. They married in 1785 (which was after he left Kassel) and had three children, but their marriage was not happy. From his time in Kassel on, Forster actively corresponded with important figures of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], including [[Gotthold Ephraim Lessing|Lessing]], [[Johann Gottfried Herder|Herder]], [[Christoph Martin Wieland|Wieland]] and [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]]. He also initiated cooperation between the Carolinum in Kassel and the [[University of Göttingen]] where his friend [[Georg Christoph Lichtenberg]] worked. Together, they founded and published the scientific and literary journal ''Göttingisches Magazin der Wissenschaften und Litteratur''.&lt;ref&gt;Saine, p. 27&lt;/ref&gt; Forster's closest friend, [[Samuel Thomas von Sömmering]], arrived in Kassel shortly after Forster, and both were soon involved with the [[Rosicrucian]]s in Kassel.

However, by 1783 Forster saw that his involvement with the Rosicrucians not only led him away from real science, but also deeper into debt&lt;ref&gt;Saine, p. 33&lt;/ref&gt; (it is said he was not good at money&lt;ref name="intro"/&gt;); for these reasons Forster was happy to accept a proposal by the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth [[Komisja Edukacji Narodowej]] (Commission of National Education) and became Chair of Natural History at [[Vilnius University]] in 1784.&lt;ref&gt;Reintjes, p. 50&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, he was accepted well in [[Vilnius]], but he felt more and more isolated with time. Most of his contacts were still with scientists in Germany; especially notable is his dispute with [[Immanuel Kant]] about the definition of [[race (classification of human beings)|race]].&lt;ref&gt;Saine, pp. 43–48&lt;/ref&gt; In 1785, Forster traveled to [[University of Halle|Halle]] where he submitted his thesis on the plants of the South Pacific for a doctorate in medicine.&lt;ref name="OnTheContinent"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Aulie |first1=Richard P. |author-link=Richard P.

Moreover, his famous speech on natural history in 1785 went almost unnoticed and was not printed until 1843. These events led to high tensions between him and the local community.&lt;ref name="Bodi"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bodi|first=Leslie|chapter=Georg Forster: The "Pacific Expert" of eighteenth-century Germany|title=Literatur, Politik, Identität &amp;#x2013; Literature, Politics, Cultural Identity|pages=29, 54|publisher=Röhrig Universitätsverlag|year=2002|isbn=3-86110-332-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, he broke the contract six years short of its completion as [[Catherine II of Russia]] had offered him a place on a journey around the world (the [[Mulovsky expedition]]) for a high honorarium and a position as a professor in [[Saint Petersburg]].&lt;ref name="King"&gt;{{cite journal|last=King|first=Robert J.|year=2008|title=The Mulovsky expedition and Catherine II's North Pacific empire|journal=Australian Slavonic and East European Studies|volume=21|issue=1/2|pages=101–126|url=http://miskinhill.com.au/journals/asees/21:1-2/mulovsky-expedition|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091025062759/http://miskinhill.com.au/journals/asees/21:1-2/mulovsky-expedition|archivedate=October 25, 2009|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; This resulted in a conflict between Forster and the influential Polish scientist [[Jędrzej Śniadecki]]. However, the Russian proposal was withdrawn and Forster left Vilnius. He then settled in [[Mainz]], where he became head librarian of the [[University of Mainz]], a position held previously by his friend [[Johannes von Müller]], who made sure Forster would succeed him when Müller moved to the administration of [[Prince-elector|Elector]] [[Friedrich Karl Josef von Erthal]].&lt;ref&gt;Saine, p. 59&lt;/ref&gt;

Forster regularly published essays on contemporary explorations and continued to be a very prolific translator; for instance, he wrote about Cook's third journey to the South Pacific, and about the [[Mutiny on the Bounty|Bounty]] expedition, as well as translating Cook's and Bligh's diaries from these journeys into German.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=King|first=Robert J.|title=The Call of the South Seas: Georg Forster and the expeditions to the Pacific of Lapérouse, Mulovsky and Malaspina|journal=Georg-Forster-Studien|volume=XIII|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; From his London years, Forster was in contact with Sir [[Joseph Banks]], the initiator of the Bounty expedition and a participant in Cook's first journey. While at the University of Vilnius he wrote the article "Neuholland und die brittische Colonie in Botany-Bay", published in the ''Allgemeines historisches Taschenbuch'' (Berlin, December 1786), an essay on the future prospects of the English colony founded in [[New South Wales]] in 1788.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Neuholland und die brittische Colonie in Botany-Bay|last = Sprengel|first = Matthias Christian|publisher = Australasian Hydrographic Society|year = 2008|isbn = |location = |pages = |url = http://www.australiaonthemap.org.au/content/view/47/59/|orig-year = 1787|trans-title = New Holland and the British Colony at Botany Bay|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080719062302/http://www.australiaonthemap.org.au/content/view/47/59/|archive-date = July 19, 2008|chapter = German text (Google Books)|chapter-url = https://books.google.com/books?id=MvM9AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA11&amp;dq=Taschenbuch+1787+Forster|others = Translated by Robert J. King}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another interest of his was [[indology]] – one of the main goals of his failed expedition to be financed by Catherine II had been to reach India. He translated the [[Sanskrit]] play ''[[Shakuntala]]'' using a [[Latin]] version provided by Sir [[William Jones (philologist)|William Jones]]; this strongly influenced Herder and triggered German interest in the culture of India.&lt;ref name="Ackerknecht"&gt;Ackerknecht, p. 85&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Views from the Lower Rhine''==
[[File:Cathedral Arch.jpg|thumb|left|One of the entrances of [[Cologne Cathedral]], which was praised in ''Ansichten vom Niederrhein'']]
In the second quarter of 1790, Forster and the young Alexander von Humboldt started from Mainz on a long journey through the [[Southern Netherlands]], the [[Dutch Republic|United Provinces]], and England, eventually finishing in Paris. The impressions from the journey were described in a three volume publication ''Ansichten vom Niederrhein, von Brabant, Flandern, Holland, England und Frankreich im April, Mai und Juni 1790'' (''Views of the Lower Rhine, from Brabant, Flanders, Holland, England, and France in April, May and June 1790''), published 1791–94. Goethe said about the book: "One wants, after one has finished reading, to start it over, and wishes to travel with such a good and knowledgeable observer." The book includes comments on the [[history of art]] that were as influential for the discipline as ''A Voyage Round the world'' was for [[ethnology]]. Forster was, for example, one of the first writers who gave just treatment to the [[Gothic architecture]] of [[Cologne Cathedral]],&lt;ref&gt;Saine, p. 103&lt;/ref&gt; which was widely perceived as "barbarian" at that time. The book conformed well to the early [[Romanticism|Romantic]] intellectual movements in German-speaking Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Encyclopedia of the Romantic Era, 1760–1850: A-L|last = Murray|first = Christopher John|publisher = Taylor &amp; Francis|year = 2003|isbn = 978-1-57958-423-8|location = |pages = 365}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Forster's main interest, however, was again focused on the social behavior of people, as 15 years earlier in the Pacific. The national uprisings in [[Flanders]] and [[Duchy of Brabant|Brabant]] and the [[French Revolution|revolution in France]] sparked his curiosity. The journey through these regions, together with the Netherlands and England, where citizens' freedoms were equally well developed, in the end helped him to resolve his own political opinions. From that time on he was to be a confident opponent of the [[ancien régime]]. With other German scholars, he welcomed the outbreak of the revolution as a clear consequence of the Enlightenment. As early as July 30, 1789, shortly after he heard about the [[Storming of the Bastille]], he wrote to his father-in-law, philologist [[Christian Gottlob Heyne]], that it was beautiful to see what philosophy had nurtured in people's minds and then had realized in the state. To educate people about their rights in this way, he wrote, was after all the surest way; the rest would then result as if by itself.&lt;ref name="zeit"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schweigard|first=Jörg|title=Freiheit oder Tod!|trans-title=Liberty or Death!|work=[[Die Zeit]]|issue=29|year=2001|url=http://www.zeit.de/2001/29/200129_a-14_juli_xml|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life as a revolutionary==

===Foundation of the Mainz Republic===
[[File:Freiheitsbaum.jpg|thumb|right|A [[liberty pole]], a symbol of revolutionary France as used in the [[Republic of Mainz]]. Watercolor by [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]].]]
The French revolutionary army under [[General Custine]] gained control over [[Mainz]] on October 21, 1792. Two days later, Forster joined others in establishing a [[Jacobin Club]] called "Freunde der Freiheit und Gleichheit" ("Friends of Freedom and Equality") in the [[Electoral Palace Mainz|Electoral Palace]]. From early 1793 he was actively involved in organizing the [[Mainz Republic]]. This first republic located on German soil was constituted on the principles of democracy, and encompassed areas on the left bank of the [[Rhine]] between [[Landau]] and [[Bingen am Rhein|Bingen]]. Forster became vice-president of the republic's temporary administration and a candidate in the elections to the local parliament, the ''Rheinisch-Deutscher Nationalkonvent'' (''Rhenish-German National Convention''). From January to March 1793, he was an editor of ''Die neue Mainzer Zeitung oder Der Volksfreund'' (''The new Mainz newspaper or The People's Friend''). In his first article he wrote:
{{quote|Die Pressefreiheit herrscht endlich innerhalb dieser Mauern, wo die Buchdruckerpresse erfunden ward.&lt;ref name="SZ"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lepenies|first=Wolf|title=Freiheit, das Riesenkind|trans-title=Freedom, the giant child|work=[[Süddeutsche Zeitung]]|date=May 17, 2010|url=http://www.sueddeutsche.de/kultur/aufmacher-xv-freiheit-das-riesenkind-1.423586|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
{{quote|''The [[freedom of the press]] finally reigns within these walls where the [[printing press]] was invented.''}}
This freedom did not last long, though. The Mainz Republic existed only until the retreat of the French troops in July 1793 after the [[Siege of Mainz (1793)|Siege of Mainz]].

Forster was not present in Mainz during the siege. As representatives of the Mainz National Convention, he and [[Adam Lux]] had been sent to Paris to apply for Mainz – which was unable to exist as an independent state – to become a part of the [[French First Republic|French Republic]]. The application was accepted, but had no effect, since Mainz was conquered by Prussian and Austrian troops, and the old order was restored.&lt;ref name="WHKMLA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zum.de/whkmla/region/germany/mainzrep.html|title=The Mainz Republic|publisher=World History at KMLA (WHKLMA)|accessdate=May 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Forster lost his library and collections and decided to remain in Paris.&lt;ref name=nie&gt;{{Cite NIE|wstitle=Forster, Georg|year=1906}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Death in revolutionary Paris===
[[File:James Gillray Pinnacle of Liberty.jpeg|thumb|"The Pinnacle of Liberty", a satire by [[James Gillray]]]]
Based on a decree by Emperor [[Francis II, Holy Roman Emperor|Francis II]] inflicting punishments on German subjects who collaborated with the French revolutionary government, Forster was declared an outlaw and placed under the [[Imperial ban]]; a prize of 100 ducats was set on his head and he could not return to Germany.&lt;ref&gt;Saine, p. 154&lt;/ref&gt; Devoid of all means of making a living and without his wife, who had stayed in Mainz with their children and her later husband [[Ludwig Ferdinand Huber]], he remained in Paris. At this point the revolution in Paris had entered the [[Reign of Terror]] introduced by the [[Committee of Public Safety]] under the rule of [[Maximilien Robespierre]]. Forster had the opportunity to experience the difference between the promises of the revolution of happiness for all and its cruel practice. In contrast to many other German supporters of the revolution, like for instance [[Friedrich Schiller]], Forster did not turn back from his revolutionary ideals under the pressure of the terror. He viewed the events in France as a force of nature that could not be slowed and that had to release its own energies to avoid being even more destructive.&lt;ref&gt;Saine, p. 152&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the reign of terror reached its climax, Forster died after a rheumatic illness&lt;ref&gt;Reintjes, p. 136&lt;/ref&gt; in his small attic apartment at Rue des Moulins&lt;ref name="hr"&gt;{{cite AV media|url=http://www.hr-online.de/servlet/de.blueorange.xred.util.GetFile/04-165.rtf?db=hrmysql&amp;tbl=int_xredfile&amp;key=id&amp;keyval=11787328&amp;imgcol=xred_file|medium=radio script (RTF)|last=Schell|first=Christa|title=Die Revolution ist ein Orkan|trans-title=The Revolution is a Hurricane|date=November 26, 2004|accessdate=April 12, 2012|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Paris in January 1794, at the age of thirty-nine. At the time, he was making plans to visit India.&lt;ref name=nie/&gt;

==Views on nations and their culture==
Forster had partial Scottish roots and was born in Polish [[Royal Prussia]], and therefore was by birth a Polish subject. He worked in Russia, England, Poland and in several German countries of his time. Finally, he finished his life in France. He worked in different milieus and traveled a lot from his youth on. It was his view that this, together with his scientific upbringing based on the principles of the Enlightenment, gave him a wide perspective on different ethnic and national communities:

[[File:Forsterundsohn.jpg|thumb|[[Johann Reinhold Forster]] and Georg Forster in [[Tahiti]], by [[John Francis Rigaud]], 1780]]

{{quote|All peoples of the earth have equal claims to my good will&amp;nbsp;... and my praise and blame are independent of national prejudice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Forster|first=Johann Georg|title=Georg Forsters Werke, Sämtliche Schriften, Tagebücher, Briefe|trans-title=Georg Forster's works, all writings, diaries, letters|publisher=Deutsche Akademie der Wissenschaften zu Berlin|editor-first1=Gerhard|editor-last1=Steiner|year=1958|volume=II|pages=13–14|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
In his opinion all human beings have the same abilities with regard to reason, feelings and imagination, but these basic ingredients are used in different ways and in different environments, which gives rise to different cultures and civilizations. According to him it is obvious that the culture on [[Tierra del Fuego]] is at a lower level of development than European culture, but he also admits that the conditions of life there are much more difficult and this gives people very little chance to develop a higher culture. Based on these opinions he was classified as one of the main examples of 18th-century German [[cosmopolitanism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kleingeld |first=Pauline |title=Six Varieties of Cosmopolitanism in Late Eighteenth-Century Germany |journal=Journal of the History of Ideas |date=1999 |volume=60 |issue=3 |page=515 |issn=0022-5037 |url=http://www.filosofie.leidenuniv.nl/content_docs/publicaties/Kleingeld/six_varieties_of_cosmopolitanism.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080228091212/http://www.filosofie.leidenuniv.nl/content_docs/publicaties/Kleingeld/six_varieties_of_cosmopolitanism.pdf |archivedate=February 28, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast to the attitude expressed in these writings and to his Enlightenment background, he used insulting terms expressing prejudice against Poles in his private letters during his stay in Vilnius and in a diary from the journey through Poland,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lawaty|first=Andreas|contribution="Polnische Wirtschaft" und "deutsche Ordnung": Nachbarbilder und ihr Eigenleben|title=Der Fremde, Interdisziplinäre Beiträge zu Aspekten von Fremdheit|trans-title=The Stranger, Interdisciplinary Contributions to Aspects of Foreignness|editor-first1=Bernhard|editor-last1=Oestreich|publisher=Peter Lang Verlag|year=2003|pages=156–166|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Krause|first=Hans-Thomas|contribution=Georg Forster und Polen|title=Georg Forster (1754–1794).

==Legacy==
After Forster's death, his works were mostly forgotten, except in professional circles. This was partly due to his involvement in the French revolution. However, his reception changed with the politics of the times, with different periods focusing on different parts of his work. In the period of rising nationalism after the Napoleonic era he was regarded in Germany as a "traitor to his country", overshadowing his work as an author and scientist. This attitude rose even though the philosopher [[Karl Wilhelm Friedrich Schlegel]] wrote about Forster at the beginning of the 19th century:
{{quote|Among all those authors of prose who are justified in laying claim to a place in the ranks of German classics, none breathes the spirit of free progress more than Georg Forster.&lt;ref name="Schlegel"&gt;Schlegel, Friedrich. ''Kritische Schriften'', ed. W. Rasch, 2nd ed., Munich: Hanser 1964, translated by T. Saine in the preface to ''Georg Forster''&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Some interest in Forster's life and revolutionary actions was revived in the context of the liberal sentiments leading up to the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states|1848 revolution]].&lt;ref name="Saine"&gt;Saine, introduction&lt;/ref&gt; But he was largely forgotten in the Germany of [[Wilhelm II of Germany|Wilhelm II]] and more so in the [[Third Reich]],&lt;ref name="hr"/&gt; where interest in Forster was limited to his stance on Poland from his private letters. Interest in Forster resumed in the 1960s in [[East Germany]], where he was interpreted as a champion of [[class struggle]].&lt;ref name="wurzner"&gt;{{cite book|last=Würzner|first=M.

The Alexander von Humboldt foundation named a scholarship program for foreign scholars from developing countries after him.&lt;ref name="avh"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.humboldt-foundation.de/en/programme/stip_aus/gf.htm|title = Georg Forster Research Fellowships|date = |accessdate = May 22, 2015|website = |publisher = [[Alexander von Humboldt Foundation]]|last = |first = |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070203055805/http://www.humboldt-foundation.de/en/programme/stip_aus/gf.htm|archivedate = February 3, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; His reputation as one of the first and most outstanding German ethnologists is indisputable, and his works are seen as crucial in the development of ethnology in Germany into a separate branch of science.&lt;ref name="Bast"&gt;{{cite web |first1=Bianca|last1=Bast|title=Georg Forster – Die Wiederentdeckung eines Genies|trans-title=Georg Forster – The Rediscovery of a Genius |url=http://www.uni-protokolle.de/nachrichten/id/61496/ |language=de |publisher=uni-protokolle.de|date=July 31, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''geosynchronous transfer orbit''' or '''geostationary transfer orbit''' ('''GTO''') is a [[Hohmann transfer orbit]]—an [[elliptical orbit]] used to transfer between two [[Circular orbit|circular orbits]] of different radii in the same plane—used to reach [[geosynchronous orbit|geosynchronous]] or [[geostationary orbit]] using high-thrust chemical engines.&lt;ref name=smad2ed&gt;
Larson, Wiley J. and James R. Wertz, eds. Space Mission Design and Analysis, 2nd Edition. Published jointly by Microcosm, Inc. (Torrance, CA) and Kluwer Academic Publishers (Dordrecht/Boston/London). 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;

Geosynchronous orbits (GSO) are useful for various civilian and military purposes, but demand a great deal of [[delta-v]] to attain. Since, for station-keeping, satellites intended for this orbit typically carry highly efficient but low-[[thrust]] engines, total mass delivered to GSO is generally maximized if the launch vehicle provides only the delta-v required to be at high thrust, i.e., to escape Earth's atmosphere and overcome gravitational losses, and the satellite provides the delta-v required to turn the resulting intermediate orbit, which is the GTO, into the useful GSO.

==Technical description==

GTO is a [[highly elliptical orbit|highly elliptical Earth orbit]] with an [[apogee]] of {{convert|42164|km|mi|abbr=on}},&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book |title=Fundamentals of Astrodynamics and Applications |last=Vallado |first=David A. |year=2007 |publisher=Microcosm Press |location=Hawthorne, CA  |pages=31 }}
&lt;/ref&gt; or {{convert|35786|km|mi|abbr=on}} above sea level, which corresponds to the geostationary altitude. The period of a standard geosynchronous transfer orbit is about 10.5 hours.&lt;ref&gt;Mark R. Chartrand, ''Satellite Communications for the Nonspecialist,'' SPIE Press 2004, [https://books.google.com/books?id=MM0d2cMUWbEC&amp;pg=PA164&amp;lpg=PA164&amp;dq=gto+period+hours&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=T4Z8DfTgY0&amp;sig=PAKMTT96dR-Z6Plz30gFKj5UTIA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiY6eDKkZTNAhUaA1IKHXi9D24Q6AEIMTAD#v=onepage&amp;q=gto%20period%20hours&amp;f=false p. 164].&lt;/ref&gt; The [[argument of perigee]] is such that apogee occurs on or near the equator. Perigee can be anywhere above the atmosphere, but is usually restricted to a few hundred kilometers above the Earth's surface to [[Oberth effect|reduce launcher delta-V (&lt;math&gt;\Delta V&lt;/math&gt;)]] requirements and to [[Orbital decay|limit the orbital lifetime of the spent booster]] so as to curtail [[Space debris|space junk]]. If using low-thrust engines such as [[electrical propulsion]] to get from the transfer orbit to geostationary orbit, the transfer orbit can be [[Supersynchronous orbit|supersynchronous]] (having an apogee above the final geosynchronous orbit). However, this method takes much longer to achieve due to the low thrust injected into the orbit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Spitzer | first = Arnon | title = Optimal Transfer Orbit Trajectory using Electric Propulsion | publisher = [[USPTO]] | date = 1997 | url = http://www.google.com/patents/US5595360}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Koppel | first = Christophe R.| title = Method and a system for putting a space vehicle into orbit, using thrusters of high specific impulse | publisher = USPTO | date = 1997 | url = http://www.google.com/patents/US6213432}}&lt;/ref&gt; The typical launch vehicle injects the satellite to a supersynchronous orbit having the apogee above 42,164&amp;nbsp;km. The satellite's low-thrust engines are thrusted continuously around the geostationary transfer orbits in an inertial direction. This inertial direction is set to be in the velocity vector at apogee but with an outer plane direction. The outer plane direction removes the initial inclination set by the initial transfer orbit, while the inner plane direction raises simultaneously the perigee and lowers the apogee of the intermediate geostationary transfer orbit. In case of using the Hohmann transfer orbit, only a few days are required to reach the geosynchronous orbit. By using low-thrust engines or electrical propulsion, months are required until the satellite reaches its final orbit.

The [[orbital inclination]] of a GTO is the angle between the orbit plane and the Earth's [[equator|equatorial plane]]. It is determined by the [[latitude]] of the launch site and the launch [[azimuth]] (direction). The inclination and eccentricity must both be reduced to zero to obtain a geostationary orbit. If only the [[Orbital eccentricity|eccentricity]] of the orbit is reduced to zero, the result may be a geosynchronous orbit but will not be geostationary. Because the &lt;math&gt;\Delta V&lt;/math&gt; required for a plane change is proportional to the instantaneous velocity, the inclination and eccentricity are usually changed together in a single maneuver at apogee, where velocity is lowest.

The required &lt;math&gt;\Delta V&lt;/math&gt; for an inclination change at either the ascending or descending [[orbital node|node]] of the orbit is calculated as follows:&lt;ref name="Curtis, H.D. 2010 pp. 356-357"&gt;Curtis, H. D. (2010) [[Orbital Mechanics for Engineering Students]], 2nd Ed. Elsevier, Burlington, MA, pp. 356–357.&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta V = 2 V \sin \frac{\Delta i}{2}.&lt;/math&gt;

For a typical GTO with a [[semi-major axis]] of 24,582&amp;nbsp;km, [[perigee]] velocity is 9.88&amp;nbsp;km/s and [[apogee]] velocity is 1.64&amp;nbsp;km/s, clearly making the inclination change far less costly at apogee. In practice, the inclination change is combined with the orbital circularization (or "[[apogee kick]]") burn to reduce the total &lt;math&gt;\Delta V&lt;/math&gt; for the two maneuvers. The combined &lt;math&gt;\Delta V&lt;/math&gt; is the vector sum of the inclination change &lt;math&gt;\Delta V&lt;/math&gt; and the circularization &lt;math&gt;\Delta V&lt;/math&gt;, and as the sum of the lengths of two sides of a triangle will always exceed the remaining side's length, total &lt;math&gt;\Delta V&lt;/math&gt; in a combined maneuver will always be less than in two maneuvers. The combined &lt;math&gt;\Delta V&lt;/math&gt; can be calculated as follows:&lt;ref name="Curtis, H.D. 2010 pp. 356-357"/&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta V = \sqrt{ V_{t,a}^2 + V_\text{GEO}^2 - 2 V_{t,a} V_\text{GEO} \cos \Delta i},&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;V_{t,a}&lt;/math&gt; is the velocity magnitude at the apogee of the transfer orbit and &lt;math&gt;V_\text{GEO}&lt;/math&gt; is the velocity in GEO.

==Other considerations==

Even at apogee, the fuel needed to reduce inclination to zero can be significant, giving equatorial launch sites a substantial advantage over those at higher latitudes. [[Baikonur Cosmodrome]] in [[Kazakhstan]] is at 46° north latitude. [[Kennedy Space Center]] is at 28.5° north. [[Guiana Space Centre]], the [[Ariane (rocket family)|Ariane]] launch facility, is at [[5th parallel north|5° north]]. [[Sea Launch]] launches from a floating platform directly on the equator in the [[Pacific Ocean]].

[[Expendable launch system|Expendable]] launchers generally reach GTO directly, but a spacecraft already in a low Earth orbit ([[Low Earth orbit|LEO]]) can enter GTO by firing a [[rocket]] along its orbital direction to increase its velocity. This was done when geostationary spacecraft were launched from the [[space Shuttle]]; a "perigee kick motor" attached to the spacecraft ignited after the shuttle had released it and withdrawn to a safe distance.

Although some launchers can take their payloads all the way to geostationary orbit, most end their missions by releasing their payloads into GTO. The spacecraft and its operator are then responsible for the maneuver into the final geostationary orbit.  The 5-hour coast to first apogee can be longer than the battery lifetime of the launcher or spacecraft, and the maneuver is sometimes performed at a later apogee or split among multiple apogees. The solar power available on the spacecraft supports the mission after launcher separation. Also, many launchers now carry several satellites in each launch to reduce overall costs, and this practice simplifies the mission when the payloads may be destined for different orbital positions.

Because of this practice, launcher capacity is usually quoted as spacecraft mass to GTO, and this number will be higher than the payload that could be delivered directly into GEO.

For example, the capacity (adapter and spacecraft mass) of the [[Delta IV Heavy]] is 14,200kg to GTO, or 6,750kg directly to geostationary orbit.&lt;ref&gt;United Launch Alliance, ''Delta IV Launch Services User's Guide'' June 2013, p. 2-10, Figure 2-9; {{cite web|url=http://www.ulalaunch.com/site/docs/product_cards/guides/Delta%20IV%20Users%20Guide%20June%202013.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-10-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131014123330/http://www.ulalaunch.com/site/docs/product_cards/guides/Delta%20IV%20Users%20Guide%20June%202013.pdf |archivedate=2013-10-14 |df= }} accessed 2013 July 27.&lt;/ref&gt;

If the manoeuvre from GTO to GEO is to be performed with a single impulse, as with a single solid-rocket motor, apogee must occur at an equatorial crossing and at synchronous orbit altitude. This implies an argument of perigee of either 0° or 180°. Because the argument of perigee is slowly perturbed by the [[Flattening|oblateness]] of the Earth, it is usually biased at launch so that it reaches the desired value at the appropriate time (for example, this is usually the sixth apogee on [[Ariane 5]] launches&lt;ref&gt;ArianeSpace, ''Ariane 5 User's Manual'' Issue 5 Revision 1, 2011 July, p. 2-13, {{cite web |url=http://www.arianespace.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Ariane5_users_manual_Issue5_July2011.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-03-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160309022120/http://www.arianespace.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Ariane5_users_manual_Issue5_July2011.pdf |archivedate=2016-03-09 |df= }} accessed 8 March 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;). If the GTO inclination is zero, as with [[Sea Launch]], then this does not apply. (It also would not apply to an impractical GTO inclined at 63.4°; see [[Molniya orbit]].)

The preceding discussion has primarily focused on the case where the transfer between LEO and GEO is done with a single intermediate transfer orbit.  More complicated trajectories are sometimes used. For example, the [[Proton-M]] uses a set of three intermediate orbits, requiring five upper-stage rocket firings, to place a satellite into GEO from the high-inclination site of [[Baikonur Cosmodrome]], in [[Kazakhstan]].&lt;ref&gt;International Launch Services, [http://www.ilslaunch.com/sites/default/files/pdf/Proton%20Mission%20Planner%27s%20Guide%20Revision%207%20%28LKEB-9812-1990%29.pdf ''Proton Mission Planner's Guide''] Rev. 7 2009 November, p. 2-13, Figure 2.3.2-1, accessed 2013 July 27.&lt;/ref&gt;  Because of Baikonur's high latitude and range safety considerations that block launches directly east, it requires less delta-v to transfer satellites to GEO by using a [[Supersynchronous orbit|supersynchronous transfer orbit]] where the apogee (and the maneuver to reduce the transfer orbit inclination) are at a higher altitude than 35,786&amp;nbsp;km, the geosynchronous altitude.  Proton even offers to perform a supersynchronous apogee maneuver up to 15 hours after launch.&lt;ref&gt;International Launch Services, [http://www.ilslaunch.com/sites/default/files/pdf/Proton%20Mission%20Planner%27s%20Guide%20Revision%207%20%28LKEB-9812-1990%29.pdf ''Proton Mission Planner's Guide''] Rev. 7 2009 November, accessed 2013 July 27 Appendix F.4.2, page F-8.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Nancy and Stephen Grand Technion Energy Program''' ('''GTEP''') or '''Grand Technion Energy Program''' was established in 2007 at [[Technion - Israel Institute of Technology]], which is [[Israel|Israel's]] first university, founded in 1912.

==Overview==
GTEP's stated aim is to bring together [[Technion – Israel Institute of Technology|Technion's]] researchers to discover and tap alternative and renewable energy sources, promote more [[efficient energy use]], and reduce the environmental damage caused by the production of fossil fuels.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.focus.technion.ac.il/Oct10/energyStory2.htm ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101129221032/http://www.focus.technion.ac.il/Oct10/energyStory2.htm |date=November 29, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

GTEP is [[interdisciplinary]], with members spanning the range from [[nano science]] through to [[applied engineering (field)|applied engineering]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.focus.technion.ac.il/previousIssues/FocusOct10.pdf |format=PDF |title=Technion Focus |date=October 2010 |publisher=Focus.technion.ac.il |accessdate=2015-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The stated GTEP mission is:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ats.org/site/PageNavigator/southern_ca_energy] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722021446/http://www.ats.org/site/PageNavigator/southern_ca_energy |date=July 22, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Caledonides EN.svg|thumb|upright=1.2|Reconstruction showing the collision of three paleocontinents during [[Caledonian orogeny]] approximately 390 million years ago.  The red line shows where the Iapetus Suture extends through present-day [[Ireland]] and [[Great Britain]]. A related suture through Denmark, Poland and Ukraine is the [[Trans-European Suture Zone]].]]
The '''Iapetus Suture''' is one of several major [[Fault (geology)|geological fault]]s caused by the collision of several ancient land masses forming a [[suture (geology)|suture]].  It represents in part the remains of what was once the [[Iapetus Ocean]]. Iapetus was the father of Atlas in Greek mythology, making his an appropriate name for what used to be called the 'Proto-Atlantic Ocean'. When the Atlantic Ocean opened, in the Cretaceous period, it took a slightly different line from that of the Iapetus suture, with some originally Laurentian rocks being left behind in north-west Europe and other, Avalonian, rocks remaining as part of Newfoundland.

==Background==

The Iapetus Ocean was an ancient ocean which existed in the [[Southern Hemisphere]] approximately 600 million years ago and was bordered by several paleocontinents: [[Laurentia]], [[Ganderia]], [[Carolinia]], [[Avalonia]], and [[Baltica]]. During a series of geological events, the [[Salinic orogeny]] and [[Caledonian orogeny]] all three land masses began to converge upon each other slowly diminishing the ocean by subducting the oceanic crust. By the end of the [[Silurian|Silurian period]], approximately 420 million years ago, the ocean had disappeared. The geological fault zone resulting from the continental collision is known as the Iapetus Suture, named after the ocean it replaced.

The closure of Iapetus involved a complex and protracted collisional history of numerous micro-continents, volcanic arcs and back-arc basins that were accreted to [[Laurentia]] and Avalonia between the Early [[Ordovician]] and Late [[Silurian]]. The notion of a single suture zone in a complex orogen such as the Appalachian/Caledonian is unrealistic as several temporal and spatial distinct suture zones are present.

==In Canada==

The Early Ordovician (Taconic) [[Baie Verte, Newfoundland and Labrador|Baie Verte]] Line in [[Quebec]] and [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]] marks the boundary between the continental margin of Laurentia and Iapetan oceanic rocks, while the Early Ordovician (Penobscot) GRUB Line defines the contact between the vestiges of Iapetus and [[Ganderia]]. The Middle Ordovician [[Red Indian Lake|Red Indian]] Line is considered the main Iapetan suture zone in that it separates peri-Laurentian and peri-Gondwanan oceanic elements. The Dog Bay Line is a younger feature in the Appalachians and delineates the terminal Iapetan suture in Newfoundland as it marks the Early Silurian (Salinic) collisional zone between Ganderia and Laurentia.&lt;ref&gt;J. C. Pollock, D. H. C. Wilton, C. R. van Staal, and K. D. Morrissey U-Pb detrital zircon geochronological constraints on the Early Silurian collision of Ganderia and Laurentia along the Dog Bay Line: The terminal Iapetan suture in the Newfoundland Appalachians. Am J Sci, February 1, 2007; 307(2): 399–433&lt;/ref&gt;

==In the United States==

The suture runs through the north-eastern states of Maine, New Hampshire, Massachusetts and Connecticut. Rhode Island lies entirely to the east of the suture.

==In Ireland==

The estuary of the [[River Shannon]] (Ireland's largest river) follows the line of the Iapetus suture on the west coast. The suture reaches the east coast at [[Clogherhead]] in [[County Louth]]. Ireland's crust (and sedimentary rocks) to the north-west of the suture originally derives from Laurentia (proto-North America), while the crust to the south-east is Avalonian ("European").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = A Geological Field Guide to Cooley, Gullion, Mourne &amp; Slieve Croob | author = Sadhbh Baxter | url = http://louthheritage.ie/publications_4_55731807.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==On the Isle of Man (Niarbyl Fault)==

[[File:Iapetus Suture - Niarbyl Fault - Isle of Man - kingsley - 23-JUN-09.jpg|thumb|The Niarbyl Fault marks the Iapetus Suture on the Isle of Man. The rocks at top and left formed in [[Laurentia]] but the rocks at lower right formed in [[Gondwana]]]]
The '''Niarbyl Fault''' is an exposed section of the Iapetus Suture as it crosses through the [[Irish Sea]].  It is readily visible in present-day [[Niarbyl, Isle of Man|Niarbyl]] on the southwest coast of [[Isle of Man]].  The fault is manifested by two major [[Group (stratigraphy)|rock groups]] which abut each other, both deposited by their respective, aforementioned continents – the [[Manx Group]] to the south-east and the [[Dalby Group]] to the north-west.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Dalby Group |publisher=Manx Geological Survey|author1=Burnett, Dave |author2=Guard, Charles |author3=Quirk, Dave | year=2003 |work=Manx Geological Survey |url=http://www.drzo.com/mgs/dalbygrp.html |accessdate=15 August 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Niarbyl fault is evidence of two paleocontinents colliding: [[Avalonia]] on which present-day [[England]] is located and Laurentia which contains both present-day [[North America]] and [[Scotland]].

The fault is visible close to the shoreline downhill from the Niarbyl Cafe and Visitor Centre in Niarbyl.

==In Great Britain==

The Caledonian orogeny united the northern and southern portions of present-day [[Great Britain]].  The Iapetus Suture runs from the [[Solway Firth]] to [[Lindisfarne]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Hill |first=John |title=Palaeozoic History of the UK - Part 1: Cambrian to Silurian |url=http://www.geologyrocks.co.uk/tutorials/palaeozoic_history_of_uk_part_1 |date=7 February 2007&lt;!-- 12:49 --&gt;|work=GeologyRocks |accessdate=16 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

was established as a public charitable trust on 5 June 1980 for organising programs and providing learning platform in the areas of ecology, environment, pollution control, disaster management, sustainable development, ecological tourism and environmental education. The Institute also collaborates with the Government of Delhi in conducting ecological education in more than 1000 schools in New Delhi. The Institute arranges for technology transfer on [[environmental engineering]], [[impact assessment]], [[Pollution control|pollution monitoring and control]], [[systems analysis]], [[wildlife conservation]], [[environmental communication]], ecological education and [[environmental laws]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;

The '''Indoor Environmental Quality Global Alliance (IEQ-GA)''' was initiated in 2014 &lt;ref&gt;American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers - ASHRAE: "[http://www.nxtbook.com/nxtbooks/ashrae/ashraeinsights_201408/ ASHRAE Insights, August 2014]"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jessica Lyons Hardcastle, "[http://www.environmentalleader.com/2014/07/11/indoor-environmental-quality-alliance-formed/ Indoor Environmental Quality Alliance Formed]", Environmental Leader, July 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Governo Law Firm, "Newly Formed Alliance: Premier Resource for Indoor Environmental Quality", July 2014&lt;/ref&gt; aiming to improve the actual, delivered indoor environmental quality in buildings through coordination, education, outreach and advocacy. The alliance works to supply information, guidelines and knowledge on the [[Building science|indoor environmental quality (IEQ)]] in buildings and workplaces,&lt;ref&gt;BUILD UP energy solutions for better buildings, "[http://www.buildup.eu/news/41608 International Societies form Indoor Environmental Quality – Global Alliance (IEQ-GA)]", 2014&lt;/ref&gt; and to provide occupants in buildings and workplaces with an acceptable indoor environmental quality (([[indoor air quality]] (IAQ), thermal conditions, visual quality, and acoustical quality)) and help promote implementation in practice of knowledge from research on the field.

The group has already begun work to collect and critique IEQ standards and is organising and presenting programmes at the conferences of member organisations&lt;ref&gt;ASHRAE: "[http://www.techstreet.com/ashrae/products/1899131#jumps SEMINAR 8 Indoor environmental quality: a global and holistic perspective, part 1]", 2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;ASHRAE: "[http://www.techstreet.com/ashrae/products/1899132#jumps SEMINAR 8 Indoor environmental quality: a global and holistic perspective, part 2]", 2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Air Infiltration and Ventilation Centre|Air Infiltration and Ventilation Centre - AIVC]]: "[http://www.aivc.org/news/indoor-environmental-quality-global-alliance-first-sessions-june-2015-ashrae-annual-conference Indoor Environmental Quality Global Alliance first sessions at the June 2015 ASHRAE Annual conference]", September 2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Air Infiltration and Ventilation Centre|Air Infiltration and Ventilation Centre - AIVC]], "[http://www.aivc.org/sites/default/files/36-AIVC-program.pdf 36th AIVC Conference Programme]", September 2015&lt;/ref&gt; and others.

The Alliance was officially launched on June 29, 2014 during [[ASHRAE]]’s 2014 Annual Conference in [[Seattle]]; a [[memorandum of understanding]] was signed and the Alliance was formed.&lt;ref&gt;[[venticool]]: "[http://venticool.eu/international-societies-form-indoor-environmental-quality-global-alliance-ieq-ga/ International Societies form Indoor Environmental Quality – Global Alliance] (IEQ-GA)", 2014&lt;/ref&gt;  Bill Bahnfleth, ASHRAE’s 2013-2014 president, appointed an ad-hoc committee to look at ways for industry groups to cooperate and address aspects of indoor environmental quality and health.&lt;ref&gt;ASHRAE: "[https://www.ashrae.org/communities/indoor-environmental-quality-global-alliance-ieq-ga Indoor Environmental Quality--Global Alliance (IEQ-GA)]", 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

== Partners and governmental organisations ==
Founding members of the Indoor Environmental Quality Global Alliance include organisations that broadly deal with the indoor environments as well as those specialised primarily in [[Indoor Air Quality]](IAQ). 
The Alliance’s current partners include the American Industrial Hygiene Association (AIHA), the [[Air Infiltration and Ventilation Centre]] (AIVC), [[ASHRAE|the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE)]] the Air &amp; Waste Management Association (A&amp;WMA), the Indoor Air Quality Association (IAQA), and the Federation of European Heating and Air-Conditioning Associations ([https://www.rehva.eu/ REHVA]) &lt;ref&gt;ASHRAE, "[https://www.ashrae.org/File%20Library/Communities/Memoranda%20of%20Understanding/IEQ-GA-MOU.pdf Memorandum of Understanding- Indoor Environmental Quality – Global Alliance (IEQ-GA)]", Retrieved August 2018&lt;/ref&gt;. The Alliance is also supported by governmental organisations such as the [[World Health Organization]].&lt;ref&gt;Chartered Institution of Building Services Engineers (CIBSE): "[http://www.cibsejournal.com/archive/PDFs/CIBSE-Journal-2014-08.pdf Industry seeks to redress IAQ balance]", CIBSE Journal August 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1220">'''Ionic transfer''' is the transfer of ions from one liquid phase to another. This is related to the [[phase transfer catalyst]]s which are a special type of [[liquid-liquid extraction]] which is used in [[Chemical synthesis|synthetic]] [[chemistry]].

For instance [[nitrate]] [[anion]]s can be transferred between water and [[nitrobenzene]]. One way to observe this is to use a [[cyclic voltammetry]] experiment where the liquid-liquid interface is the working [[electrode]]. This can be done by placing secondary electrodes in each phase and close to interface each phase has a [[reference electrode]]. One phase is attached to a potentiostat&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.consultrsr.com/resources/pstats/ Potentiostats - Their Care and Feeding&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060613050453/http://consultrsr.com/resources/pstats/ |date=2006-06-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which is set to zero volts, while the other [[potentiostat]] is driven with a triangular wave. This experiment is known as a polarised Interface between Two Immiscible Electrolyte Solutions ([[ITIES]]) experiment.

[[File:Purified Viruses.jpg|right|thumb|100px|Viruses purified by isopycnic centrifugation— a density gradient was formed during high speed centrifugation of a solution of [[caesium chloride]] and the two virus types come to rest at points corresponding to their density. The tube is about 10cm long.]]

An '''isopycnic surface''' is a surface of constant density inside a [[fluid]].

In [[geology]], Isopycnic surfaces occur especially in connection with [[craton]]s which are very old geologic formations at the core of the [[continent]]s, little affected by [[tectonic]] events. These formations are often known as [[Shield (geology)|shields]] or [[Platform (geology)|platforms]]. These formations are, relative to other [[Lithosphere|lithospheric]] formations, cooler and less dense but much more isopycnic.&lt;ref name="urlSN"&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://www.sciencenews.org/view/feature/id/66927/title/Continental_Hearts |title=Continental Hearts – Science News |author=Charles Petit |authorlink= |date=18 December 2010 |publisher=Science News |pages=22–26 |archiveurl=|archivedate= |accessdate=2011-01-08
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Isopycnic surfaces contrast with [[wikt:isobaric|isobaric]] or [[isothermal]] surfaces, which describe surfaces of constant pressure and constant temperature respectively. It is common in conversational use to hear isopycnic surfaces referred to simply as "iso-density" surfaces, which while strictly incorrect, is nonetheless abundantly more clear.

The term "isopycnic" is commonly encountered in the fluid dynamics of compressible fluids, such as in meteorology and geophysical fluid dynamics, astrophysics, or the fluid dynamics of explosions or high Mach number flows. It may also be applied to other situations where a continuous medium has smoothly-varying density, such as in the case of an inhomogeneous colloidal suspension. In general isopycnic surfaces will occur in fluids in hydrostatic equilibrium coinciding with equipotential surfaces formed by gravity.

Isopycnic typically describes surfaces, not processes. Unless there is a flux of mass into or out of a control volume, a process which occurs at a constant density also occurs at a constant volume and is called an isochoric process and not an isopycnic process.

The term "isopycnic" is also encountered in biophysical chemistry, usually in reference to a process of separating particles, subcellular [[organelle]]s, or other substances on the basis of their density.   Isopycnic centrifugation refers to a method wherein a density gradient is either pre-formed or forms during high speed centrifugation. After this gradient is formed particles move within the gradient to the position having a density matching their own (this is in fact an incorrect description of the exact physical process but does describe the result in a meaningful way).  This technique is extremely powerful.

'''Lanshan''' mountain range (Ch. 兰山) is a  mountain range along northern shore of the [[Yellow River]] east from the capital [[Lanzhou]] of the [[Gansu]] [[Province of China|province]] in northwestern [[China]].

The area of the Lanshan mountains played a prominent role in the history of early China, 
changing hands many times in the course of events, after the fall of the [[Han Dynasty]]  there was located a capital of a succession of states, in the 4th century it was a capital of the independent state [[Earlier Liang]], and from the 5th to the 11th century it became a center for [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] study in China.

[[Arizona]] has been affected by [[tropical cyclone|hurricanes]] on numerous occasions. Usually, these storms originate in the [[Tropical cyclone basins#Northeast Pacific Ocean|eastern Pacific Ocean]], make landfall in the [[Mexico|Mexican]] states of [[Baja California]] or [[Sonora]], and dissipate before crossing into the United States. Thus, in most cases, it is only the tropical cyclones' remnant moisture that produces heavy rainfall—and in some occasions, flooding—in portions of Arizona. However, approximately every five years, a tropical cyclone retains sufficient strength to enter the state as a [[Tropical cyclone#Intensities of tropical cyclones|tropical storm]] or a [[tropical depression]]. Arizonans can expect indirect [[flash flood]]s caused by the remnants of tropical cyclones to occur about every two years.&lt;ref name="NWS Tucson"/&gt;

Tropical cyclones in Arizona are not common, since the [[Trade wind|predominant wind pattern]] steers most storms that form in the Eastern Pacific either parallel or away from the Pacific coast of northwestern Mexico. As a result, most storms that could affect Arizona are carried away from the United States, with only 6% of all Pacific hurricanes entering US territory.&lt;ref name="monsoon"&gt;{{cite web|first=Kristen L.|last=Corbosiero|title=The Contribution of Eastern North Pacific Tropical Cyclones to the Warm Season Rainfall Climatology of the Southwestern United States|year=2003|publisher=[[University of Albany]]|accessdate=2011-07-23|url=http://www.atmos.ucla.edu/~kristen/monsoon/monsoon.html |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060505070334/http://www.atmos.albany.edu/student/kristen/monsoon.html |archivedate = 2006-05-05 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Not all Arizona hurricanes originate from the Pacific Ocean, however; in July 2008 an [[Atlantic hurricane]] named [[Hurricane Dolly (2008)|Hurricane Dolly]] produced rainfall in the eastern portion of the state, and another Atlantic storm reached Arizona as a tropical depression. Many, but not all, of these systems also [[List of California tropical storms|impacted California]].

Despite their rarity, hurricanes are among Arizona's most significant weather makers. In years when Arizona is affected by a tropical cyclone, these can be responsible for up to 25% of the rainfall in areas along the [[Colorado River]]. Arizona hurricanes are also responsible for torrential rains in localized areas, with the state's 24-hour rainfall record—{{convert|11.97|in|mm}} of precipitation&lt;ref name="MCFCD"/&gt;—occurring during [[Hurricane Nora (1997)|Hurricane Nora]]'s [[landfall (meteorology)|landfall]] in 1997. The heavy rainfall can trigger extensive flash floods, such as the ones produced by the remnants of [[October 1983 Southwest United States floods|Tropical Storm Octave]] in 1983, or the lingering moisture from [[Tropical Storm Emilia (2006)|Tropical Storm Emilia]] in 2006.

Tropical cyclones are not common over Arizona, but on average, a tropical storm or a tropical depression enters the state approximately every five years. However, indirect [[flash flood]]s caused by the remnants of tropical cyclones are more common, as they tend to occur about every two years.&lt;ref name="NWS Tucson"&gt;{{cite web|author=National Weather Service, Tucson Regional Office|title=Tropical cyclones in Arizona|accessdate=2011-07-21|url=http://www.wrh.noaa.gov/twc/tropical/tropical.php}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Storms that approach the southwestern United States, and by extension Arizona, generally form closer to the Mexican shoreline than average, making them more likely to recurve northwards under the influence of an approaching [[trough (meteorology)|trough]]. These troughs tend to extend farther to the south during the latter part of the Pacific hurricane season, in the period between late August and early October. These pronounced troughs thus produce a [[synoptic scale|synoptic-scale]] flow that is conducive to steering hurricanes towards the southwestern United States.&lt;ref name="Corbosiero MWR"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Corbosiero|first=Kristen L.|author2=Dickinson, Michael J. |author3=Bosart, Lance F. |title=The Contribution of Eastern North Pacific Tropical Cyclones to the Rainfall Climatology of the Southwest United States|journal=[[Monthly Weather Review]]|date=August 2009|volume=137|issue=8|pages=2415–2435|doi=10.1175/2009MWR2768.1|bibcode = 2009MWRv..137.2415C }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The infusions of tropical moisture from Arizona-bound tropical cyclones can be a significant portion of the rainfall in the region. In years when hurricanes approach Arizona, eastern and northern portions of the state receive on average 6–8% of the [[North American Monsoon|monsoon-season]] precipitation from tropical systems and their remnants. This percentage rises towards the southwestern corner of the state, which can receive up to a quarter of its monsoon-season rainfall from tropical cyclones.&lt;ref name="Corbosiero MWR"/&gt;

==Storms==
Tropical storms are one of Arizona's main sources of rainfall, as they infuse the [[North American Monsoon|monsoon over the southwestern United States]] with moisture, producing large-scale floods in occasions.&lt;ref name="USGS"&gt;{{cite web | title=Hydrologic Conditions in Arizona During 1999–2004: A Historical Perspective | publisher=[[United States Geological Survey]] | author = Arizona Water Science Center | accessdate=2006-03-20 |date=September 2005 | url=http://pubs.usgs.gov/fs/2005/3081/pdf/FS2005-3081WEB.pdf | format = PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, all of the storms that have impacted Arizona have formed in the latter parts of the [[Pacific hurricane season]], and only storm remnants have affected the state before August.&lt;ref name="monsoon"/&gt;

==Storm systems==
{{Wettest tropical cyclones in Arizona|align=right}}
Several of these tropical cyclones have caused deaths or heavy property damage, usually due to flooding caused by rain.

===Before 1960===
Records of [[Pacific hurricane|tropical cyclones in the East Pacific]] before 1950 are sparse, but there were still several storms that produced rainfall over Arizona in this period.
*August 1921:  The first known tropical disturbance to affect the state occurred when a remnant low of a tropical cyclone moved into the western portions of the state.&lt;ref name="USA Today California"&gt;{{cite news | author = Williams, Jack | url = https://www.usatoday.com/weather/whhcalif.htm | title = Background: California's tropical storms | date = May 17, 2005 | newspaper = [[USA Today]] | accessdate = 2008-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* September 1921: A tropical depression that had tracked parallel to the Mexican coastline moved into Arizona, causing heavy rainfall on September 30.&lt;ref name="MWR 1921"&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://docs.lib.noaa.gov/rescue/mwr/057/mwr-057-02-0043.pdf | title = Tropical Cyclones of the Eastern North Pacific Ocean | journal = [[Monthly Weather Review]] | author = Hurd, Willis E. |date=February 1929 | volume = 57 | issue = 2 | accessdate = 2008-05-16 | format = PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This tropical storm caused more than three inches of rainfall along the [[Colorado River]] valley, with {{convert|3.65|in|mm|lk=on}} of rain reported in [[Yuma, Arizona|Yuma]]. Throughout the state, [[Flagstaff, Arizona|Flagstaff]] saw {{convert|1.50|in|mm}} of rainfall, while {{convert|1.24|in|mm}} of precipitation fell in [[Prescott, Arizona|Prescott]], {{convert|0.68|in|mm}} in [[Tucson, Arizona|Tucson]], and {{convert|0.56|in|mm}} in [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]].&lt;ref name="NWS Phoenix"/&gt;
* September 1926: Five years later, the remnants of another September storm hit the state, but this time the precipitation was heaviest on the southeastern portion of the state. The 1926 storm caused over {{convert|5.00|in|mm}} of rain in the vicinity of [[Douglas, Arizona|Douglas]].&lt;ref name="NWS Phoenix"/&gt;
* September 1927: The remnants of another tropical system caused {{convert|1|–|2|in|mm}} of rainfall throughout the state.&lt;ref name="NWS Phoenix"/&gt;
* June 1929: The [[Atlantic hurricane reanalysis]] project discovered that a rare [[North Atlantic tropical cyclone|Atlantic hurricane]] reached the eastern part of the state as a tropical depression.{{hurdat-ATL}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Christopher W. Landsea|title=A Reanalysis of the 1921 to 1930 Atlantic Hurricane Database|url=http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/Landsea/19211930jc-main.pdf|publisher=[[Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratory]]|accessdate=2011-07-21|page=34|date=May 2011 | format = PDF|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Damage from this storm, if any, is unknown.
* August 1935: The remnants of an unnamed tropical storm that landed on Southern California caused torrential rain and flooding across Arizona, especially along the [[Santa Cruz River (Arizona)|Santa Cruz River]] and Rillito Creek on Southern Arizona. The rainfall from the storm contributed to an extremely wet month of August, which still holds the monthly rainfall record at the National Weather Service office in Tucson, as {{convert|5.61|in|mm}} of rainfall fell during the month.&lt;ref name="USACE Pima"/&gt;
* September 1939: Two tropical systems entered the state during the month. On September 4, the remnants of a former hurricane entered southwest Arizona, near Yuma. More than {{convert|5.00|in|mm}} of precipitation fell in northwest Arizona, with many parts of the state collecting more than an inch of rain.&lt;ref name="NWS Phoenix"/&gt; This same system produced more than twice the average annual rainfall in [[Imperial Valley (California)|Imperial Valley, California]].&lt;ref name="USA Today California"/&gt; On the 11th, the remnants of a separate system also passed over southwest Arizona.&lt;ref name="USA Today California"/&gt;
*August 1951: No tropical cyclones are known to have affected Arizona in the 1940s. However, in the 1950s, the remnants of two more storms affected the state. On August 24, 1951, the moisture from a hurricane that made landfall in [[Baja California]] moved over the state, producing more than {{convert|5.00|in|mm}} of precipitation over southwestern Arizona. Flagstaff saw {{convert|4.00|in|mm}} of rain, with similar totals measured at Prescott ({{convert|3.95|in|mm|disp=x|; }}) and Phoenix ({{convert|3.24|in|mm|disp=x|; }}). The storm also washed out several roadways near [[Gila Bend, Arizona|Gila Bend]], isolating the city from motorists. Overall, the storm caused $750,000 (1951 [[USD]]) in property damage.&lt;ref name="NWS Phoenix"/&gt;
*July 1954: Three years later, the remnants of another hurricane moved over Arizona from the south during the month of July. Damage from this storm is unknown.&lt;ref name="USA Today California"/&gt;

===1960s===
* September 1962: Remnant moisture from [[1962 Pacific hurricane season#Tropical Storm Claudia|Tropical Storm Claudia]] caused severe flash floods in the vicinity of Tucson, with {{convert|5|to|7|in|mm}} of precipitation falling over the headwaters of the [[Arroyo (creek)|washes]] of Santa Rosa, Jackrabbit, and [[Brawley Wash|Brawley]] during a 14- to 15-hour period.&lt;ref name="USACE Pima" /&gt;  Over {{convert|7|in|mm}} of rainfall also fell near the [[Arizona-Sonora Desert Museum]].&lt;ref name="NWS Phoenix"/&gt; The ensuing flood of the [[Santa Cruz River (Arizona)|Santa Cruz River]] and its tributaries produced a path of destruction about {{convert|100|mi|km}} long and up to {{convert|8|mi|km}} wide. Santa Rosa Wash conveyed {{convert|53100|cuft/s|m3/s|lk=on}} at its peak; Los Robles Wash carried up to {{convert|32600|cuft/s|m3/s|abbr=on}}, while the Santa Cruz River proper peaked at {{convert|9200|cuft/s|m3/s|abbr=on}}. The washes and rivers reached depths of up to {{convert|20|ft|m}}, and overflowed its banks in places by {{convert|1|to|6|ft|m}}.&lt;ref name="USACE Pima" /&gt; Flooding from the storm inundated the towns of [[Marana, Arizona|Marana]] and [[Sells, Arizona|Sells]], both in [[Pima County, Arizona|Pima County]].&lt;ref name="NWS Phoenix"/&gt; Total damage in Pima and [[Pinal County, Arizona|Pinal]] Counties exceeded $11 million (1962 USD).&lt;ref name="USACE Pima" /&gt;
* September 1964: The next storm to affect the state was [[1964 Pacific hurricane season#Tropical Storm Tillie|Tropical Storm Tillie]] in 1964. Although the storm remained at sea,&lt;ref name="NOAA CSC"/&gt; its residual moisture was advected over southern Arizona, allowing a passing [[cold front]] to trigger widespread showers and thunderstorms on the evening of September 9.&lt;ref name="USACE Pima" /&gt; Tucson received {{convert|3.05|in|mm}} of rainfall in a 24-hour period between September 9–10,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Green|first=Raymond, A.|title=The Weather and Circulation of September 1964|journal=Monthly Weather Review|date=December 1964|volume=92|issue=12|pages=601–606|doi=10.1175/1520-0493(1964)092&lt;0601:TWACOS&gt;2.3.CO;2|bibcode = 1964MWRv...92..601G }}&lt;/ref&gt; and two locations—one in the [[Catalina Mountains|Catalina Mountain foothills]] and one near [[Sahuarita, Arizona|Sahuarita]]—recorded {{convert|6.75|in|mm}} of precipitation. Coupled with rain during the previous week, the Santa Cruz River produced heavy runoff, with peak flows of {{convert|15900|cuft/s|m3/s|abbr=on}} recorded near [[Cortaro, Arizona|Cortaro]].&lt;ref name="USACE Pima" /&gt;
* September 1965: The following year, the remnants of [[1965 Pacific hurricane season#Hurricane Emily|Hurricane Emily]] crossed into Arizona from Baja California.&lt;ref name="NOAA CSC"/&gt; Any damage from the storm is not known.
* September 1966: The remnants of [[Tropical Storm Kirsten (1966)|Kirsten]] caused {{convert|1.26|in|mm}} of rainfall in [[Nogales, Arizona|Nogales]].&lt;ref name="NWS Tucson-Kirsten"&gt;{{cite web|author=National Weather Service, Tucson Regional Office|title=Hurricane Kirsten 1966|accessdate=2011-07-21|url=http://www.wrh.noaa.gov/twc/tropical/kirsten_1966.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* August 1968: Two storms approached Arizona in 1968. The first was [[1968 Pacific hurricane season#Tropical Storm Hyacinth|Tropical Storm Hyacinth]] in August. It reached the southeastern corner of the state as a tropical depression,&lt;ref name="NOAA CSC"/&gt; and produced showers and thunderstorms over the eastern portion of the state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Denney|first=William J.|title=The Eastern Pacific Hurricane Season of 1968|journal=Monthly Weather Review|date=March 1969|volume=97|issue=3|pages=207–224|doi=10.1175/1520-0493(1969)097&lt;0207:TEPHSO&gt;2.3.CO;2|bibcode = 1969MWRv...97..207D }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* October 1968: The last storm to impact Arizona during the decade was [[Hurricane Pauline (1968)|Hurricane Pauline]], which added high amounts of moisture ahead of a cold front in early October. The added [[atmospheric instability|instability]] in the atmosphere allowed the cold front to produce [[severe thunderstorm]]s, including an [[Fujita scale|F2 tornado]] that wrecked several homes and caused $250,000 (1968 USD) in damage when it touched down in [[Glendale, Arizona|Glendale]].&lt;ref name="NWS Tucson-Pauline"&gt;{{cite web|author=National Weather Service, Tucson Regional Office|title=Hurricane Pauline 1968|accessdate=2011-07-21|url=http://www.wrh.noaa.gov/twc/tropical/pauline_1968.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Event Report for Arizona: Maricopa County|url=http://www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwevent~ShowEvent~5557|publisher=National Climatic Data Center|accessdate=2011-07-21|year=1968}}{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11227">[[Image:Roseberry topping north side.jpg|thumb|300px|right|[[Roseberry Topping]], a site in Cleveland designated as a geological SSSI]]&lt;onlyinclude&gt; &lt;!-- See [[Wikipedia talk:Featured lists]] for an explanation of this and other inclusion tags below --&gt;This is a '''list of the [[Sites of Special Scientific Interest]] (SSSIs) in [[Cleveland, England|Cleveland]]''', [[England]], [[United Kingdom]]. In England the body responsible for designating SSSIs is [[Natural England]], which chooses a site because of its [[fauna]], [[plant|flora]], [[geology|geological]] or physiographical features.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Notification of SSSIs |publisher=Natural England |url=http://www.sssi.naturalengland.org.uk/special/sssi/notification.cfm |accessdate=17 June 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120515062100/http://www.sssi.naturalengland.org.uk/special/sssi/notification.cfm |archivedate=15 May 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; {{As of|2006}}, there are 18 sites designated within this [[Area of Search]], of which 12 have been designated due to their biological interest, 4 due to their geological interest, and 2 ([[Durham Coast SSSI|Durham Coast]] and [[Redcar Rocks]]) for both.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=SSSIs in Cleveland | publisher=Natural England | url=http://www.sssi.naturalengland.org.uk/Special/sssi/searchresults.cfm?sssi_name=&amp;frmcounty=1007 | accessdate=17 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;noinclude&gt;Natural England took over the role of designating and managing SSSIs from [[English Nature]] in October 2006 when it was formed from the amalgamation of English Nature, parts of the [[Countryside Agency]] and the [[Rural Development Service]]. Natural England, like its predecessor, uses the [[Metropolitan and non-metropolitan counties of England|1974&amp;ndash;1996 county system]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=County search of SSSIs |publisher=Natural England |url=http://www.sssi.naturalengland.org.uk/Special/sssi/search.cfm |accessdate=17 June 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100819192309/http://www.sssi.naturalengland.org.uk/Special/sssi/search.cfm |archivedate=19 August 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and as such the same approach is followed here, rather than splitting these sites between the [[List of SSSIs in County Durham|County Durham]] and [[List of SSSIs in North Yorkshire|North Yorkshire]] lists. The data in the table is taken from Natural England's website in the form of citation sheets for each SSSI.&lt;ref name="citation sheets"&gt;''Natural England'' citation sheets for each SSSI ([[PDF]] files).

The [[Philippines]] lies along the [[Pacific Ring of Fire]], which causes the country to have frequent seismic and volcanic activity. Many earthquakes of smaller magnitude occur very regularly due to the meeting of major tectonic plates in the region. The largest was the [[1918 Celebes Sea earthquake]] with {{M|w|8.3|link=y}}.

==Spanish period==

===17th century===
* An intensity VI quake struck [[Manila]] on June 25, 1599. The quake had damaged many private buildings and the city and ruined the roof of Old [[Santo Domingo Church]].
* An intensity VIII quake struck [[Manila]] on January 2, 1600.
* A quake struck [[Manila]] on January 16, 1601. The earthquake lasted about 7 minutes, and aftershocks were experienced the whole year.
* An intensity VII quake struck the municipalities of [[Dulag, Leyte|Dulag]] and [[Palo, Leyte|Palo]], [[Leyte]] in December 3, 1608.
* An intensity IX quake struck [[Manila]] on November 1610. It was a terrible quake that progressed from east to west.
* An intensity IX quake struck [[Panay Island]] on 1620. A great number of casualties were reported in [[Capiz]] and [[Iloilo]] provinces. The earthquake changed the course of the [[Aklan River]] and damaged stone churches and their façades in [[Passi, Iloilo]].
* An intensity X quake struck [[Luzon|Northern Luzon]] on 1627. Convulsions were felt in [[Cagayan]] and [[Ilocos Norte]] provinces, the [[Bontoc, Mountain Province|Bontoc]] and [[Mountain Province#Spanish Period|Lepanto]], and central parts of the [[Cordillera Central (Luzon)|Cordillera Central]]. Other sources claimed that the [[Caraballo Mountains]] somewhat subsided.
* [[1628 Camarines earthquake|An intensity IX quake]] struck [[Albay]] and [[Camarines]]&lt;ref&gt;Districts nearby [[Mayon Volcano]] and [[Camalig, Albay|Camalig]], not the present-day Camarines provinces.&lt;/ref&gt; on 1628. The quake caused avalanches of [[volcanic ash|ash]]es, [[lapilli]], water and sand that swept away whole towns in Albay and Camarines.
* An intensity IX quake struck [[Illana Bay]], Western [[Mindanao]] on December 21, 1636. Landslides reported along [[Illana Bay]], [[Sibuguey Bay]] and Point Flechas.
* An intensity X quake struck [[Luzon|Northern Luzon]] on January 4, 1641. The quake occurred after the 1641 eruption of [[Mount Parker (Cotabato)|Mount Parker]]. Landslides and mudflow destroyed villages in [[Ilocos]] provinces, [[Cagayan]] and the [[Cordillera Central (Luzon)|Cordillera Central]].
* [[1645 Luzon earthquake|A magnitude 7.5 quake struck Luzon]] on November 30, 1645. The earthquake was then the strongest to hit the Islands since the Spanish conquest.&lt;ref&gt;Blair, Emma Helen and Robertson, James Alexander (1906). [https://books.google.com/books?id=JjRJxF_vcaUC&amp;pg=PA17#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false "The Philippine Islands 1493–1898 Vol. XXXV"], pg. 17. Arthur H. Clark Co., Cleveland.&lt;/ref&gt;  It had greatly damaged newly constructed churches and [[Manila Cathedral]], along with residential villas and buildings in the city and nearby provinces. Some 600 people were reported dead.&lt;ref name="Eqtap"&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://eqtap.edm.bosai.go.jp/publications/ACEE/pdf/ACEE-55.pdf | title=Philippine Historical Earthquakes and Lessons Learned |author1=Bautista, Maria Leonila P.  |author2=Bautista, Bartolome C.  |lastauthoramp=yes| journal=EqTAP Project}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* An intensity VIII quake struck [[Luzon]] on December 5, 1645. It was a major aftershock of the November 30, 1645 Luzon earthquake, and it had further destroyed remaining buildings in Manila and nearby towns. Aftershocks ceased around March 1646.
* An intensity IX quake struck Southern Luzon on 1648. It was a very violent earthquake that wrecked many buildings.
* An intensity VI quake struck [[Manila]] on May 1, 1653.
* An intensity IX quake struck Southern Luzon on August 20, 1658. It was comparable to the [[1645 Luzon earthquake]], but had caused less damage on building and was less proximity from the epicenter. It had destroyed the Royal Monastery of Santa Clara, several monasteries of the [[Order of Preachers|Dominicans]] and [[Augustinian Recollects|Recollects]], the [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] College and episcopal palaces.&lt;ref name="Eqtap"/&gt;
* A magnitude 5.5 quake struck [[Manila]] on June 19, 1665. Only a Jesuit church experienced great damage. 19 were reported dead.
* An intensity VIII struck [[Isla Verde Passage]] in February 1675. The quake destroyed many buildings in northern [[Oriental Mindoro]] and southern [[Batangas]] provinces. This led to occurrences of landslides, opening of ground fissures, and subsidence of beaches along the coast of Mindoro.
* An intensity VII struck [[Manila]] on August 24, 1683.

===18th century===
* An intensity VII struck Lake Bombon (now known as [[Taal Lake]]) on September 24, 1716. It was connected with the eruption of [[Taal volcano]]; the constant volcanic activity in the area of Taal caused seismic movements.
* An intensity IX struck Tayabas (now known as [[Quezon]]) in 1730. It had ruined the churches and convent in [[Mauban]] and several other churches in the province of [[Quezon|Tayabas]] and [[Laguna (province)|Laguna]].

===19th century===
[[File:Manila Cathedral belfry after the 1880 earthquake.jpg|thumb|The belfry of [[Manila Cathedral]] after the series of destructive earthquakes of July 1880.]]
* An earthquake on June 3, 1863, destroyed [[Manila Cathedral]], the ''[[Ayuntamiento de Manila|Ayuntamiento]]'' (city hall), the Governor's Palace (all three located at the time on Plaza Mayor, now [[Plaza de Roma]]) and much of the city. The residence of the Governor-General was moved to [[Malacañang Palace]] located about 3&amp;nbsp;km (1.9 miles) up the [[Pasig River]], while the other two buildings were rebuilt in place.
* [[1880 Luzon earthquakes|An intensity X quake]] struck Luzon on July 14 to 25, 1880.&lt;ref name="GoogleBooks1"&gt;{{cite book | title=Seismic and Volcanic Centers of the Philippine Archipelago | publisher=''Bureau of Printing'' | author=Maso, Saderra | year=1902 | location=[[Manila]] | page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The quake caused severe damage to these major cities in Luzon, most significantly in Manila where a lot of buildings collapsed. Number of casualties are unknown.&lt;ref name="Eqtap"/&gt;
* A quake struck [[Lucban, Quezon]] on October 26, 1884. It destroyed churches in [[Lucban, Quezon|Lucban]], [[Tayabas (province)|Tayabas province]] (now known as [[Quezon (province)|Quezon province]]) and [[Cavinti, Laguna|Cavinti]] in Laguna province.&lt;ref name="Eqtap"/&gt;
*[[1897 Mindanao earthquakes|Two earthquakes]] struck near [[Basilan]] Island near [[Mindanao]] on September 20 and 21, 1897.  Both earthquakes triggered tsunamis, with the second being quite destructive, with a maximum run-up of 7.0 m. At least 13 died as a result of the second tsunami, with a hundred or more casualties also being reported.

==American period and Post-World War II==

===Early 20th century===
* A magnitude 7.5 quake struck [[Northern Mindanao|Northeastern Mindanao]] on July 11, 1912. Damage and high intensity were experienced by towns of [[La Paz, Agusan del Sur|La Paz]], [[Bunauan, Agusan del Sur|Bunauan]], [[Veruela, Agusan del Sur|Veruela]] and [[Talacagon, Agusan del Sur|Talacogon]] in the [[Legislative district of Agusan|Agusan Valley]] where intense ground shaking, liquefaction, widespread landslides and river/lake seiches occurred.&lt;ref name="Bayugan"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://202.90.128.66/1999BayuganEQ/index-bayugan.html | title=June 1999 Earthquakes in Agusan del Sur, Philippines | publisher=[[Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology]] | accessdate=February 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The {{M|w|8.3}} [[1918 Celebes Sea earthquake|Celebes Sea earthquake]] occurred on August 15, 1918 with a maximum [[Mercalli intensity scale|Mercalli intensity]] of X (''Extreme''). The offshore shock affected the southern Philippines with high intensity shaking and a destructive tsunami that left 52 people dead.
* A strong magnitude 8.0 earthquake struck [[Davao Region|Southern Mindanao]] on April 14, 1924.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=M 8.0 - Mindanao, Philippines |url=https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/eventpage/iscgem910911#executive |website=USGS |accessdate=26 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* A magnitude 7.8 [[Moment magnitude scale|M&lt;sub&gt;w&lt;/sub&gt;]] earthquake struck [[1948 Lady Caycay earthquake|Panay Island on January 25, 1948 at 1:46 AM]]. The epicenter was between the municipalities of [[Anini-y, Antique|Anini-y]] and [[Dao, Antique|Dao]] in Antique province.

== Incidents ==

This is not a complete list of all pipeline accidents. '''For natural gas alone''', the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA), a United States Department of Transportation agency, has collected data on more than 3,200 accidents deemed serious or significant since 1987.

A "significant incident" results in any of the following consequences:
* fatality or injury requiring in-patient hospitalization
* $50,000 or more in total costs, measured in 1984 dollars
* liquid releases of five or more barrels (42 US gal/barrel)
* releases resulting in an unintentional fire or explosion

PHMSA and the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) post incident data and results of investigations into accidents involving pipelines that carry a variety of products, including natural gas, oil, diesel fuel, gasoline, kerosene, jet fuel, carbon dioxide, and other substances. Occasionally pipelines are repurposed to carry different products.&lt;ref&gt;Data sets of PHMSA Pipeline Safety-Flagged Incidents for 1986-2001, 2002-2009, and 2010-2017 can be downloaded from the tab by that name on the PHMSA's Pipeline Incident Flagged Files page at https://www.phmsa.dot.gov/data-and-statistics/pipeline/pipeline-incident-flagged-files, accessed 2018.01.10. PHMSA Corrective Action Orders are at https://primis.phmsa.dot.gov/comm/reports/enforce/CAO_opid_0.html. PHMSA Pipeline Failure Investigation Reports are at https://www.phmsa.dot.gov/safety-reports/pipeline-failure-investigation-reports. NTSB Pipeline Accident Reports are at https://www.ntsb.gov/investigations/AccidentReports/Pages/pipeline.aspx.&lt;/ref&gt;

* On January 2, [[Enbridge]]'s Line 2 ruptured near [[Neche, North Dakota]], releasing about 3,784 barrels of crude oil, of which 2,237 barrels of were recovered. The cause was a material defect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://primis.phmsa.dot.gov/comm/reports/operator/OperatorIM_opid_11169.html?nocache=5280#_Incidents_tab_3 |title=PHMSA: Stakeholder Communications |publisher=Primis.phmsa.dot.gov |date= |accessdate=April 2, 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130602185558/http://primis.phmsa.dot.gov/comm/reports/operator/OperatorIM_opid_11169.html?nocache=5280 |archivedate=June 2, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CPF No. 3-2010-5001H |url=http://primis.phmsa.dot.gov/comm/reports/enforce/documents/320105001H/320105001H_CAO_01192010.pdf |accessdate=28 November 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170215110410/https://primis.phmsa.dot.gov/comm/reports/enforce/documents/320105001H/320105001H_CAO_01192010.pdf |archivedate=February 15, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* On February 1, a plumber trying to unclog a sewer line in [[St. Paul, Minnesota]] ruptured a gas service line that has been "cross bored" through the house's sewer line. The plumber and resident escape the house moments before as an explosion and following fire destroyed the house. The Minnesota Office of Pipeline Safety ordered that gas utility, Xcel, to check for more cross bored gas lines. In the following year, 25,000 sewer lines inspected showed 57 other cross bored gas lines. In [[Louisville, Kentucky]], 430 gas line cross bores were found in {{convert|200|mi|km}} of a sewer project, including some near schools and a hospital. The NTSB had cited such cross bore incidents as a known hazard since 1976.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=A year later, gas line checks continue |publisher=StarTribune.com |url=http://www.startribune.com/local/115153164.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130203061257/http://www.startribune.com/local/115153164.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=February 3, 2013 |accessdate=May 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crossboresafety.org/history.htm |title=History |publisher=CrossboreSafety.org |date=February 9, 1999 |accessdate=April 2, 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130417114346/http://www.crossboresafety.org/history.htm |archivedate=April 17, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* On February 7, a power plant explosion occurred at the Kleen Energy Systems, killing 5 and injuring a dozen.

* On March 1, at about 8:10&amp;nbsp;am, Mid-Valley Pipeline identified a release of crude oil in the manifold area of the Mid-Valley tank farm in [[Longview, Texas]]. Crude oil was observed "gushing" from the soil in the manifold area. About 198 barrels of crude oil were estimated to have been released and 196 barrels were recovered from the secondary containment area within Mid-Valley's site.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.phmsa.dot.gov/staticfiles/PHMSA/PipelineFailureReports/Mid-Valley%20Pipeline%20HL%20TX%202010-03-01%20508.pdf Failure Investigation Report – Mid-Valley Pipeline Internal Corrosion] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120402093120/http://www.phmsa.dot.gov/staticfiles/PHMSA/PipelineFailureReports/Mid-Valley%20Pipeline%20HL%20TX%202010-03-01%20508.pdf |date=April 2, 2012 }} Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration, November 7, 2011, accessed September 5, 2015, 31 pages&lt;/ref&gt;
* On March 2, 2010, Reno County 911 dispatch was notified about a natural gas leak in a 26-inch diameter interstate pipeline at Red Rock Road and Andre Road near [[Abbyville, Kansas]]. Twenty people were evacuated as a precaution. The leak was caused by a ruptured girth weld in the pipe owned by [[Southern Star Central Gas Pipeline]]. The pipe was manufactured in 1967.&lt;ref name="auto5"&gt;PHMSA Pipeline Safety-Flagged Incidents for 2010-2017, PHMSA Pipeline Incident Flagged Files page, https://www.phmsa.dot.gov/data-and-statistics/pipeline/pipeline-incident-flagged-files, accessed 2018.01.10.&lt;/ref&gt; 
* On March 15, a 24-inch gas pipeline burst, but did not ignite near [[Pampa, Texas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Joe |last=Gamm |url=http://amarillo.com/stories/031610/new_news7.shtml |title=No injuries in gas line rupture north of Pampa |publisher=Amarillo Globe-News |date=March 16, 2010 |accessdate=April 2, 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131028041341/http://amarillo.com/stories/031610/new_news7.shtml |archivedate=October 28, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* On March 25, there was a release of 1700 barrels of [[Vacuum gas oil]] (VGO) from the FM-1 pipeline into an open in-ground valve pit and the surrounding area in the West Yard of the Sunoco, R&amp;M [[Philadelphia]] refinery in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The area was under the control of the Operator in a fenced off area that is off-limits to the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Failure Investigation Report – Sunoco R&amp;M Flange Gasket 03/25/2010 |url=http://www.phmsa.dot.gov/staticfiles/PHMSA/PipelineFailureReports/Sunoco%20RM%20HL%20PA%202010-03-25.pdf |accessdate=28 November 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170203111219/http://www.phmsa.dot.gov/staticfiles//PHMSA/PipelineFailureReports/Sunoco%20RM%20HL%20PA%202010-03-25.pdf |archivedate=February 3, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* On April 5, a crude oil pipeline ruptured near [[Green River, Wyoming]]. At least {{convert|84,000|USgal|L}} of crude were spilled. Corrosion in the pipeline was the cause.&lt;ref name="nwf"&gt;{{cite web |title=Fuel Oil Incident List |url=http://www.nwf.org/News-and-Magazines/Media-Center/News-by-Topic/Global-Warming/2010/~/media/PDFs/Global%20Warming/Reports/Full-Oil-Incident-List.ashx |accessdate=October 30, 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100803143750/http://www.nwf.org/News-and-Magazines/Media-Center/News-by-Topic/Global-Warming/2010/~/media/PDFs/Global%20Warming/Reports/Full-Oil-Incident-List.ashx |archivedate=August 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* On April 13, a flash fire occurred as a result of incorrect operations while operator and contract employees were conducting planned maintenance at the Seymour Terminal of the Enterprise Products Operating Company, LLC(EPCO) located in [[Jackson County, Indiana]]. Two EPCO employees and two contract employees were injured.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.phmsa.dot.gov/staticfiles/PHMSA/DownloadableFiles/Files/Pipeline/Failure%20Reports/129705_FIR_TEPPCO_Seymour%20IN_2010-04-13_Final%20[Redacted%20for%20Internet.pdf|title=Failure Investigation Report—TE Products Pipeline Company, LLC (TEPPCO)—Incorrect Operations|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* On April 14, 2010, at an Enogex natural gas compressor station in [[Bennington, Oklahoma]], during construction tie-ins related to an expansion project, a contract employee was injured as a result of a flash fire which immediately extinguished itself. The contract employee's injuries required in-patient hospitalization. The cause of the accident was, in part, miscommunication between two crews working in the station at the same time.&lt;ref name="auto5"/&gt;
* On April 23, a pipeline ruptured near [[Niles, Kansas]], due to previous excavation damage. About 1,659 barrels of natural gasoline were lost.&lt;ref name="ens-newswire.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ens-newswire.com/2012/06/04/pipeline-companies-fined-1-million-for-spills-in-three-states/ |title=– Pipeline Companies Fined $1 Million for Spills in Three States – ENS |work=ens-newswire.com |accessdate=January 18, 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160203115900/http://ens-newswire.com/2012/06/04/pipeline-companies-fined-1-million-for-spills-in-three-states/ |archivedate=February 3, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* On May 10, 2010, at [[Swifton, Arkansas]], a Mississippi River Transmission Corporation employee arrived at the Swifton M&amp;R station and found the regulator engulfed in flames, evidently from a direct hit by a lightning strike which perforated the equipment.&lt;ref name="auto5"/&gt;
* On May 29, an [[Amoco]] pipeline leaked nearly 89,000 gallons of gasoline into a farm field along Quarterline Road. The leak occurred in [[Constantine Township]], [[St. Joseph County, Michigan]]. The cause was from a manufacturing defect in the pipe.&lt;ref name="dot6"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://primis.phmsa.dot.gov/comm/reports/operator/OperatorIM_opid_395.html?nocache=1547#_Incidents_tab_3 |title=PHMSA: Stakeholder Communications – Operator Information |author= |date= |work=dot.gov |accessdate=May 23, 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160307180912/http://primis.phmsa.dot.gov/comm/reports/operator/OperatorIM_opid_395.html?nocache=1547 |archivedate=March 7, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* On June 7, a 36-inch Enterprise natural gas pipeline leaked, exploded and started a fire in [[Johnson County, Texas]] when it was disturbed by workers installing poles for electrical lines. The mapping of subsurface utilities was inadequate, leading to inaccurate maps. Confusion over the location and status of the construction work led to the pipeline not being marked beforehand. These inaccuracies led to a miscommunication between the locator and the excavator, As a result, one worker was killed and seven were injured. The pipe was manufactured and installed in 1970.&lt;ref&gt;PHMSA Pipeline Safety-Flagged Incidents (2010-present), PHMSA Pipeline Incident Flagged Files page, https://www.phmsa.dot.gov/data-and-statistics/pipeline/pipeline-incident-flagged-files, accessed 2018.01.10.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="texasobserver.org"&gt;{{cite web|last=Wilder |first=Forrest |url=http://www.texasobserver.org/cover-story/the-fire-down-below |title=The Fire Down Below |publisher=The Texas Observer |date=November 26, 2010 |accessdate=April 2, 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120925193438/http://www.texasobserver.org///cover-story/the-fire-down-below |archivedate=September 25, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.platts.com/RSSFeedDetailedNews/RSSFeed/HeadlineNews/NaturalGas/6158630|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120907022650/http://www.platts.com/RSSFeedDetailedNews/RSSFeed/HeadlineNews/NaturalGas/6158630|deadurl=yes|title=Platts: RSS Feed Detailed News|date=September 7, 2012|archivedate=September 7, 2012|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* On November 8, 2010, near [[Tioga, North Dakota]], Aevenia Energy contracted to plow electrical cables underground from an oil well location owned by [[Amerada Hess]] Corporation across a wheat field to a power pole. The crew consisted of two bulldozer operators and one employee walking near the plow. Plowing started at the oil well location and had gone about 260 feet when it struck a Williston Basin Interstate Pipeline Company natural gas transmission line. The 8-inch diameter pipeline, operating at approximately 650 psig, failed after being struck by the plow, killing the person who was standing on the ground near the rupture. The two bulldozer operators jumped off their equipment and ran from the escaping gas. The force of the jetting gas blew the person on the ground 80 feet. None of the parties made a one-call notification prior to the start of the project. Two pipeline marker posts were visible from the access road into the site; the closest about 517 feet south of the rupture.&lt;ref&gt;PHMSA Pipeline Safety-Flagged Incidents for 2010-2017,PHMSA Pipeline Incident Flagged Files page, https://www.phmsa.dot.gov/data-and-statistics/pipeline/pipeline-incident-flagged-files, accessed 2018.01.10.&lt;/ref&gt;

* On November 30, a [[Tennessee Gas Pipeline]] 30-inch diameter gas pipeline failed at [[Natchitoches, Louisiana]]. There was no fire, but the pipe, which was manufactured in 1948, had a Magnetic Flux smart pig test earlier in the year that indicated no flaws. The failure was at a crack in a wrinkle bend which may have been stressed by shifting soil. The deadly 1965 gas pipeline accident had occurred on a different pipeline owned by the same company nearby.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CPF No. 4-2010-1007H |url=http://primis.phmsa.dot.gov/comm/reports/enforce/documents/420101007H/420101007H_CAO_12032010.pdf |accessdate=28 November 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161226084530/http://primis.phmsa.dot.gov/comm/reports/enforce/documents/420101007H/420101007H_CAO_12032010.pdf |archivedate=December 26, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* On December 21, a crude oil pipeline was discovered leaking into the Dominguez Channel in the Port of [[Los Angeles]]. Over 1,000 gallons of crude oil was recovered, but the pipeline company was alleged to have failed to report the spill to State or Federal pipeline authorities. A 61 count criminal complaint was later filed in this accident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.presstelegram.com/crime/ci_19640101 |title=Long Beach pipeline company charged in oil spill |publisher=Press-Telegram |date= |accessdate=April 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* On December 24, 2010, a mechanical failure at a [[Texas Gas Transmission]] compressor station near [[Youngsville, Louisiana]], caused a gas leak that ignited and exploded in the middle of the night. The Texas Gas gas control center received alarms indicating fire, vibration, and emergency shutdown alarms were activated. The fire department and state police secured the site. Once cleared by the fire chief on site, Texas Gas personnel assessed the damage. The cause of the incident was compressor component malfunction. The metallurgical report determined that six of eight engine bolts failed due to high cycle fatigue. The equipment has been installed in 1965.&lt;ref name="auto5"/&gt;

Several '''renewable energy companies''' became listed on stock exchanges in the period after 2000. The early 21st century was a very productive time for the [[renewable energy industry]], since many governments set long term [[Mandatory renewable energy targets|renewable energy targets]]. Some chose to directly subsidize the renewables with [[feed-in tariff]]s and other temporary measures to bridge the gap to [[full cost accounting]] that would properly reward these technologies for their low emissions and lack of interference with [[ecosystem services]], and also to ensure some capacity and motivation to install conservation-focused [[smart grid]] technologies.

[[Smart grid policy in the United States]] was especially important in driving renewable energy in that country (see also [[load shedding]], [[energy internet]], [[home area network]] and [[cleantech]] for more on the structure of the industry and why renewables vendors are closely aligned industrially and politically with the vendors of networking technology), [[smart appliance]]s and [[energy conservation]] software, and opposed in general to those of other "energy" firms, which effectively depend on the lack of this intelligence or accounting to appear competitive. For instance, coal vendors rely on a lack of accounting of about US$345 billion in harms done by coal to remain competitive in the US.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/02/16/usa-coal-study-idUSN1628366220110216&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004 Russia ratified the [[United Nations|United Nations']] [[Kyoto Protocol]] and the first order under this agreement came into force for the period 2008 to 2012. The period from 2002 to 2008 was a period of rapid growth for the renewable energy industry with the [[Photovoltaics|photovoltaics industry]] experiencing an average of 60% growth per annum, the [[biodiesel]] industry 42% and the [[Wind energy|wind industry]] 25%.&lt;ref name="ren21-1"/&gt; As of the end of 2007 the renewable energy industry was worth an estimated US $77.3 billion.&lt;ref name="ce-1" /&gt; As a result of this growth several companies listed [[Initial public offering|IPOs]].

Many public companies involved in the development of this industry and responsible for large market share do not participate exclusively in renewable energy and have been omitted for this list, most notable of these are [[BP Solar|BP]], [[GE Energy]] and [[Sharp Solar|Sharp]]. This list consists of companies whose ''primary'' produce is either renewable energy or renewable energy products and services.

[[Image:London Convention signatories.png|thumb|400px|London Convention signatories]]
The '''Convention on the Prevention of Marine Pollution by Dumping of Wastes and Other Matter''' 1972, commonly called the "'''London Convention'''" or "LC '72" and also abbreviated as '''Marine Dumping''', is an agreement to control pollution of the sea by dumping and to encourage regional agreements supplementary to the Convention. It covers the deliberate [[waste disposal|disposal]] at sea of [[waste]]s or other matter from vessels, aircraft, and platforms. It does not cover discharges from land-based sources such as pipes and outfalls, wastes generated incidental to normal operation of vessels, or placement of materials for purposes other than mere disposal, providing such disposal is not contrary to aims of the Convention. It entered into force in 1975. As of September 2016, there were 89 Parties to the Convention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.imo.org/en/OurWork/Environment/LCLP/Pages/default.aspx |title=London Convention |publisher=[[International Maritime Organization]] |access-date=30 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.imo.org/en/About/Conventions/StatusOfConventions/Pages/Default.aspx |title=Status of Conventions |publisher=[[International Maritime Organization]] |access-date=30 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The Convention was called for by the [[United Nations Conference on the Human Environment]] (June 1972, Stockholm), the treaty was drafted at the [[Intergovernmental Conference on the Convention on the Dumping of Wastes at Sea]] (13 November 1972, London) and it was opened for signature on 29 December 1972. It entered into force on 30 August 1975 when 15 nations ratified. As of 1 October 2001, there were 78 Contracting Parties to the Convention. International Administration of the Convention functions through Consultative Meetings held at International Maritime Organization (IMO) headquarters in London.

The London Convention consists of 22 Articles and three Annexes. It follows a "black list/grey list" approach to regulating ocean dumping; Annex I materials (black list) generally may not be ocean dumped (though for certain Annex I materials dumping may be permissible if present only as "trace contaminants" or "rapidly rendered harmless" and Annex II materials (grey list) require "special care". Annex III lays out general technical factors to be considered in establishing criteria for issuance of ocean dumping permits.

The main objective of the London Convention is to prevent indiscriminate disposal at sea of wastes that could be liable for creating hazards to human health; harming living resources and marine life; damaging amenities; or interfering with other legitimate uses of the sea. The 1972 Convention extends its scope over "all marine waters other than the internal waters" of the States and prohibits the dumping of certain hazardous materials. It further requires a prior special permit for the dumping of a number of other identified materials and a prior general permit for other wastes or matter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.imo.org/en/OurWork/Environment/LCLP/TC/Documents/London%20Protocol%20Why%20it%20is%20needed%2020%20years.pdf |title=London Protocol; why is it needed?|publisher=[[International Maritime Organization]] |access-date=30 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Implementation==
[[Image:No Dumping Drains to Stream by David Shankbone.jpg|thumb|A spray-painted sign above a sewer in [[Colorado Springs, Colorado]] warning people to not pollute the local stream by [[Environmental dumping|dumping]].]]
Since its entering into force in 1975, the convention has provided a framework for international control and prevention of marine pollution within which the contracting parties have achieved continuous progress in keeping the oceans clean. Among its milestones are the 1993 ban on ocean disposal of low-level radioactive wastes and the resolutions to end the dumping and incineration of industrial wastes. The efforts of the Parties are supported by a permanent secretariat hosted by the International Maritime Organization (IMO). The consultative meeting of the contracting parties to the London convention is the governing and political decision-making body of the convention. It takes advice on issues needing multidisciplinary expertise from the [[Joint Group of Experts on Scientific Aspects of Marine Environmental Protection (GESAMP)]] which is composed of specialised experts nominated by the IMO, FAO, UNESCO, IOC, WMO, WHO, IAEA, UN, and UNEP. A scientific group on dumping, composed of government experts from the parties to the convention a responsible to address any scientific requests from the consultative meeting, including the preparation of lists of hazardous substances, developing guide-lines on the implementation of the convention, and maintaining awareness of the impacts on the marine environments of inputs from all waste sources.

The convention is implemented in the United States through Title I of the [[Marine Protection, Research, and Sanctuaries Act]] (MPRSA) which directs that implementing regulations are to apply binding requirements of LC to the extent that this would not relax the MPRSA.

===1996 Protocol===
On 17 November 1996, a special meeting of the Contracting Parties adopted the "1996 Protocol to the Convention on the Prevention of Marine Pollution by Dumping of Wastes and Other Matter, 1972" which is to replace the 1972 Convention, subject to ratification. In line with UNCED's Agenda 21, the 1996 Protocol reflects the global trend towards precaution and prevention with the parties agreeing to move from controlled dispersal at sea of a variety of land-generated wastes towards integrated land-based solutions for most, and controlled sea disposal of few, remaining categories of wastes or other matter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.imo.org/en/OurWork/Environment/PollutionPrevention/Pages/1996-Protocol-to-the-Convention-on-the-Prevention-of-Marine-Pollution-by-Dumping-of-Wastes-and-Other-Matter,-1972.aspx |title=1996 Protocol|publisher=[[International Maritime Organization]] |access-date=30 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the most important innovations brought by the 1996 protocol is the codification of the "[[precautionary principle|precautionary approach]]" and the "polluter pays principle." Reflecting these principles, the protocol embodies a major structural revision of the convention the so-called "reverse list" approach. Now, instead of prohibiting the dumping of certain (listed) hazardous materials, the parties are obligated to prohibit the dumping of any waste or other matter that is not listed in Annex 1 ("the reverse list") of the 1996 protocol. Dumping of wastes or other matter on this reverse list requires a permit. Parties to the protocol are further obligated to adopt measures to ensure that the issuance of permits and permit conditions for the dumping of reverse list substances comply with Annex 2 (the Waste Assessment Annex) of the protocol. The substances on the reverse list include dredged material; [[sewage]] [[sludge]]; industrial [[fish processing]] waste; vessels and offshore platforms or other man-made structures at sea; inert, inorganic geological material; organic material of natural origin; and bulky items including iron, steel, concrete and similar materials for which the concern is physical impact, and limited to those circumstances where such wastes are generated at locations with no land-disposal alternatives. In addition, the 1996 protocol prohibits altogether the practice of incineration at sea, except for emergencies, and prohibits the exports of wastes or other matter to non-Parties for the purpose of dumping or incineration at sea.

The 1996 protocol has effectively moved the scope of the original London convention landwards, relating it to the policy and management issues of land as well as sea wastes disposal. Indicative for this shift are such elements as the codification of the precautionary approach and the establishment of requirements such as the "waste prevention audit," the identification and control of the sources of contamination for certain materials, and the collaboration with relevant local and national agencies that are involved in point and non-point source pollution control. In this context, Integrated Coastal Management (ICM) comes as a natural framework for effective implementation of the objectives of the protocol. Relaying on its vast ICM technical expertise, the National Ocean Service (NOS) is to contribute to the creation of the necessary foundation for the US accession to the 1996 Protocol and, further on, to the protocol's implementation. Through its International Program Office, NOS would also contribute to the international co-operation efforts towards meeting the objectives of the 1996 Protocol.

{{About|the mythological and religious figures}}
{{See also|Morning star}}
[[File:Venus over Otter Lake, from Goddard Bay.JPG|thumb|Planet Venus seen from Earth]]
'''Lucifer''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|lj|uː|s|ɪ|f|ər}} {{respell|LEW|si|fər}}; "light-bringer") was a Latin name for the planet [[Venus]] as the morning star in the ancient Roman era, and is often used for mythological and religious figures associated with the planet. Due to the unique movements and discontinuous appearances of Venus in the sky, mythology surrounding these figures often involved a fall from the heavens to earth or the underworld. Interpretations of a similar term in the Hebrew Bible, translated in the [[King James Version]] as "Lucifer", led to a Christian tradition of applying the name Lucifer and its associated stories of a fall from heaven to [[Satan]]. Most modern scholarship regards these interpretations as questionable, and translate the term in the relevant Bible passage as "morning star" or "shining one" rather than as a proper name, "Lucifer".

As a name for the Devil, the more common meaning in English, "Lucifer" is the rendering of the [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] word {{lang|he|הֵילֵל|rtl=yes}} in [[Isaiah 14|Isaiah]] ({{bibleref2|Isaiah|14:12|KJV}}) given in the [[King James Version]] of the Bible. The translators of this version took the word from the [[Latin]] [[Vulgate]],&lt;ref name="Kohler1923"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kohler|first=Dr. Kaufmann|title=Heaven and Hell in Comparative Religion with Special Reference to Dante's Divine Comedy|url=https://books.google.com/?id=xIaQYpGrmdIC&amp;pg=PA5&amp;lpg=PA4&amp;dq=Encyclopedia+of+Religion+lucifer#v=snippet&amp;q=vulgate&amp;f=false|date=2006|publisher=The MacMillanCompagny|location=New York|isbn=0-76616608-2|pages=4–5|quote="Lucifer, is taken from the Latin version, the Vulgate"}}&lt;/ref&gt; which translated הֵילֵל by the Latin word ''lucifer'' (uncapitalized),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.drbo.org/lvb/chapter/27014.htm |title=Latin Vulgate Bible: Isaiah 14 |publisher=DRBO.org |accessdate=22 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Vulgate Latin: Isaiah Chapter 14"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/bib/vul/isa014.htm#012 |title=Vulgate: Isaiah Chapter 14 |publisher=Sacred-texts.com |accessdate=22 December 2012 |language=Latin}}&lt;/ref&gt; meaning "the morning star, the planet Venus", or, as an adjective, "light-bringing".&lt;ref name="Lewis&amp;S"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0059%3Aentry%3Dlucifer |title=Charlton T.

As a name for the morning star, "Lucifer" is a [[proper name]] and is capitalized in English. In [[Greco-Roman world|Greco-Roman civilization]] the morning star was often personified and considered a [[God (male deity)|god]] or the title of a deity associated with the planet.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=2U7okUE3PIcC&amp;pg=PA193&amp;dq=dixon-kennedy+lucifer&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=dixon-kennedy%20lucifer&amp;f=false Mike Dixon-Kennedy, ''Encyclopedia of Greco-Roman Mythology'' (ABC-CLIO 1998), p. 193] {{isbn|9781576070949}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Fall from heaven ==
{{main|Venus in culture}}
The motif of a heavenly being striving for the highest seat of heaven only to be cast down to the underworld has its origins in the motions of the planet [[Venus]], known as the [[morning star]].

The [[Sumer]]ian goddess [[Inanna]] ([[Babylonia]]n Ishtar) is associated with the planet Venus.&lt;ref name="GVS"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cLN08jf_C2EC&amp;pg=PA314&amp;dq=%22several+attempts+to+find+mythical+allusions%22 |author1=Gary V.

For example, in ''Inanna's Descent to the Underworld'', Inanna is able to descend into the netherworld, where she is killed, and then resurrected three days later to return to the heavens. The three-day disappearance of Inanna refers to the three-day planetary disappearance of Venus between its appearance as a morning and evening star.&lt;ref name=Hostetter1991&gt;{{citation|last=Hostetter|first=Clyde|title=Star Trek to Hawa-i'i|location=San Luis Obispo, California|publisher=Diamond Press|date=1991|page=53}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A similar theme is present in the [[Babylonia]]n myth of [[Etana]]. The ''[[Jewish Encyclopedia]]'' comments:
::"The brilliancy of the morning star, which eclipses all other stars, but is not seen during the night, may easily have given rise to a myth such as was told of Ethana and [[Zu (mythology)|Zu]]: he was led by his pride to strive for the highest seat among the star-gods on the northern mountain of the gods ... but was hurled down by the supreme ruler of the Babylonian Olympus."&lt;ref name="Jewish"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/10177-lucifer |title=Lucifer |publisher=''[[Jewish Encyclopedia]]'' |accessdate=9 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fall from heaven motif also has a parallel in [[Canaanite mythology]]. In ancient Canaanite religion, the morning star is personified as the god [[Attar (god)|Attar]], who attempted to occupy the throne of [[Baal|Ba'al]] and, finding he was unable to do so, descended and ruled the [[underworld]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=y-gfwlltlRwC John Day, Yahweh and the gods and goddesses of Canaan] (Continuum International Publishing Group, 2002. {{ISBN|0-82646830-6}}. {{ISBN|978-0-8264-6830-7}}), pp. 172–173&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Hj791_BeAF0C Gregory A.

In classical mythology, Lucifer ("light-bringer" in Latin) was the name of the planet Venus, though it was often [[anthropomorphism|personified]] as a male figure bearing a torch. The Greek name for this planet was variously [[Phosphoros]] (also meaning "light-bringer") or [[Heosphoros]] (meaning "dawn-bringer").&lt;ref name="EBLCM"&gt;[https://www.britannica.com/topic/Lucifer-classical-mythology "Lucifer]" in ''Encyclopaedia Britannica'']&lt;/ref&gt; Lucifer was said to be "the fabled son of [[Aurora (mythology)|Aurora]]&lt;ref name="Auffarth"&gt;{{cite book | editor1-first=Christoph | editor1-last=Auffarth | editor1-link=Christoph Auffarth  | editor2-first=Loren T. | editor2-last=Stuckenbruck | editor2-link=Loren T.

He was often presented in poetry as heralding the dawn.&lt;ref name=EBLCM/&gt;

The second century Roman mythographer [[De Astronomica|Pseudo-Hyginus]] said of the planet:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theoi.com/Titan/AstraPlaneta.html Astronomica 2. 4 (trans. Grant)]&lt;/ref&gt; 
:"The fourth star is that of Venus, Luciferus by name. Some say it is Juno's. In many tales it is recorded that it is called Hesperus, too. It seems to be the largest of all stars. Some have said it represents the son of Aurora and Cephalus, who surpassed many in beauty, so that he even vied with Venus, and, as Eratosthenes says, for this reason it is called the star of Venus. It is visible both at dawn and sunset, and so properly has been called both Luciferus and Hesperus."

[[Ovid]], in his first century epic ''Metamorphoses'', describes Lucifer as ordering the heavens:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theoi.com/Titan/AstraPlaneta.html Metamorphoses 2. 112 ff (trans. Melville)]&lt;/ref&gt;
:"Aurora, watchful in the reddening dawn, threw wide her crimson doors and rose-filled halls; the Stellae took flight, in marshaled order set by Lucifer who left his station last."

In the classical Roman period, Lucifer was not typically regarded as a deity and had few, if any, myths,&lt;ref name=EBLCM/&gt; though the planet was associated with various deities and often poetically personified. [[Cicero]] pointed out that "You say that Sol the Sun and Luna the Moon are deities, and the Greeks identify the former with Apollo and the latter with Diana. But if Luna (the Moon) is a goddess, then Lucifer (the Morning-Star) also and the rest of the Wandering Stars (Stellae Errantes) will have to be counted gods; and if so, then the Fixed Stars (Stellae Inerrantes) as well."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theoi.com/Titan/AstraPlaneta.html Cicero, De Natura Deorum 3. 19]&lt;/ref&gt;

(In spite of the unanimous testimony of published texts of the Septuagint, [[Kaufmann Kohler]] says that the Greek Septuagint translation is "[[Phosphorus (morning star)|Phosphoros]]".)&lt;ref name=Kohler1923/&gt; --&gt; According to the [[King James Bible]]-based [[Strong's Concordance]], the original Hebrew word means "shining one, light-bearer", and the translation given in the King James text is the Latin name for the planet Venus, "Lucifer".&lt;ref name="H1966"/&gt;

However, the translation of הֵילֵל as "Lucifer" has been abandoned in modern English translations of Isaiah 14:12. Present-day translations render הֵילֵל as "morning star" ([[New International Version]], [[New Century Version]], [[New American Standard Bible]], [[Good News Bible|Good News Translation]], [[Holman Christian Standard Bible]], [[Contemporary English Version]], [[Common English Bible]], [[Messianic Bible translations|Complete Jewish Bible]]), "daystar" ([[New Jerusalem Bible]], [[The Message (Bible)|The Message]]), "Day Star" ([[New Revised Standard Version]], [[English Standard Version]]), "shining one" ([[New Life Version]], [[New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures|New World Translation]], [[JPS Tanakh]]), or "shining star" ([[New Living Translation]]). 

In a modern translation from the original Hebrew, the passage in which the phrase "Lucifer" or "morning star" occurs begins with the statement: "On the day the Lord gives you relief from your suffering and turmoil and from the harsh labour forced on you, you will take up this taunt against the king of Babylon: How the oppressor has come to an end! How his fury has ended!"&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Isaiah|14:3–4|NIV}}&lt;/ref&gt; After describing the death of the king, the taunt continues:

::"How you have fallen from heaven, ''morning star'', son of the dawn! You have been cast down to the earth, you who once laid low the nations! You said in your heart, 'I will ascend to the heavens; I will raise my throne above the stars of God; I will sit enthroned on the mount of assembly, on the utmost heights of [[Mount Aqraa|Mount Zaphon]]. I will ascend above the tops of the clouds; I will make myself like the Most High.' But you are brought down to the realm of the dead, to the depths of the pit. Those who see you stare at you, they ponder your fate: 'Is this the man who shook the earth and made kingdoms tremble, the man who made the world a wilderness, who overthrew its cities and would not let his captives go home?'"&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Isaiah|14:12–17|NIV}}&lt;/ref&gt;

J. Carl Laney has pointed out that in the final verses here quoted, the king of Babylon is described not as a god or an angel but as a man; and that man may have been not [[Nebuchadnezzar II]], but rather his son, [[Belshazzar]]. Nebuchadnezzar was gripped by a spiritual fervor to build a temple to the moon god [[Sin (mythology)|Sin]] (possibly analogous with [[Hubal]], the primary god of pre-Islamic [[Mecca]]), and his son ruled as regent. The Abrahamic scriptural texts could be interpreted as a weak usurping of true kingly power, and a taunt at the failed regency of Belshazzar.&lt;ref name=Laney/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Isaiah|14:16|NIV}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sigve K Tonstad argues that the [[New Testament]] [[War in Heaven]] theme of {{bibleverse||Revelation|12:7–9|ESV}}, in which the dragon "who is called the devil and Satan … was thrown down to the earth", was derived from the passage about the Babylonian king in Isaiah 14.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YYNJxKrhcDAC&amp;pg=PA75&amp;dq=Tonstad+%22derives+from+the+poem%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=soQJULj0H8SzhAftu4XuCQ&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Tonstad%20%22derives%20from%20the%20poem%22&amp;f=false |author1=Sigve K Tonstad |title=Saving God's Reputation |isbn=978-0-56704494-5 |page=75 |publisher=[[Continuum International Publishing Group|Continuum]] |location=London, New York City |date=20 January 2007 |accessdate=23 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Origen]] (184/185 – 253/254) interpreted such Old Testament passages as being about manifestations of the Devil; but writing in Greek, not Latin, he did not identify the devil with the name "Lucifer".&lt;ref name="Mask"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EU7Qt5HSmHAC&amp;printsec=frontcover |title=The Devil: A Mask without a Face |first=Luther |last=Link |publisher=[[Reaktion Books]] |location=[[Clerkenwell]], London |date=1995 |page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=EU7Qt5HSmHAC&amp;pg=PA24&amp;dq=Augustine's+%22at+the+time+he+was+writing,+Lucifer+was+not+a+common+name+for+the+Devil%22%22two+centuries+earlier,+Origen+interpreted%22%22Isaiah+as+references+to+the+manifestations+of+the+Devil.+But+no-one%22%22identify+the+Devil+with+the+name+of+Lucifer%22 24] |isbn=978-0-94846267-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Rg2RJAIZ4k4C&amp;printsec=frontcover |title=The Problem of Evil in the Western Tradition |first=Joseph Francis |last=Kelly |publisher=[[Liturgical Press]] |location=[[Collegeville Township, Stearns County, Minnesota|Collegeville, Minnesota]] |date=2002 |page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=Rg2RJAIZ4k4C&amp;pg=PA44&amp;dq=%22Origen's+approach+had+an+unintended+side+effect,+a+new+name+for+the+devil%22%22allegorized+it+as+Satan+falling+from+heaven.+When+Christians%20translated+the+phrase%22%22into+Latin,+they+used+the+word+lucifer%22 44] |isbn=978-0-81465104-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Auffarth, Christoph; Stuckenbruck, Loren T., eds.

Some time later, the metaphor of the morning star that Isaiah 14:12 applied to a king of Babylon gave rise to the general use of the Latin word for "morning star", capitalized, as the original name of the devil before his fall from grace, linking Isaiah 14:12 with {{bibleverse||Luke|10:18|NIV}} ("I saw Satan fall like lightning from heaven") and interpreting the passage in Isaiah as an allegory of Satan's fall from heaven.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IrcZEZ1bOJsC&amp;pg=PA280&amp;lpg=PA280&amp;dq=name+Lucifer+was+born+-magazine&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=7Qwvlc4AZr&amp;sig=UbOS0ltHHmWrzrd36c6z8VSXmus&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=z6oRUJ3cEdKZhQfTw4HgDw&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=name%20Lucifer%20was%20born%20-magazine&amp;f=false |title=The Merriam-Webster New Book of Word Histories |isbn=978-0-87779603-9 |page=280 |publisher=Merriam-Webster |date=1991 |accessdate=23 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=X5-pmLBcw44C&amp;pg=PA57&amp;dq=%22the+name+Lucifer+was+given%22 |author=Harold Bloom |title=Satan |publisher=Infobase Publishing |date=2005 |isbn=978-0-79108386-4 |page=57 |accessdate=23 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result, "Lucifer has become a byword for [[Satan]] or the [[Devil]] in the church and in popular literature",&lt;ref name=Kohler1923/&gt; as in [[Dante Alighieri]]'s ''[[Inferno (Dante)|Inferno]]'', [[Joost van den Vondel]]'s ''Lucifer'', and [[John Milton]]'s ''[[Paradise Lost]]''.&lt;ref name="Adelman"/&gt; However, unlike the English word, the Latin word was not used exclusively in this way and was applied to others also, including [[Jesus in Christianity|Jesus]].&lt;ref&gt;See [[#Latin word ''lucifer''|Latin word ''lucifer'']] below.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the understanding of the morning star in Isaiah 14:12 as a metaphor referring to a king of Babylon continued also to exist among Christians. [[Theodoret of Cyrus]] (c. 393 – c. 457) wrote that Isaiah calls the king "morning star", not as being the star, but as having had the illusion of being it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=y17fkvqXOBcC&amp;pg=PA252&amp;dq=%22Theodoret+of+Cyrus%22%22illusion+of+so+being%22 |author=Johanna Manley |title=Isaiah through the Ages |publisher=St Vladimir's Seminary Press |date=1995 |isbn=978-0-96225363-8 |page=252 |accessdate=23 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same understanding is shown in Christian translations of the passage, which in English generally use "morning star" rather than treating the word as a proper name, "Lucifer". So too in other languages, such as French,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=%C3%89sa%C3%AFe+14%3A12-15&amp;version=LSG |title=Ésaïe 14:12–15 |publisher=Biblegateway.com |accessdate=23 December 2012 |language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; German,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bibeltext.com/isaiah/14-12.htm |title=Jesaja 14:12 |publisher=Bibeltext.com |accessdate=23 December 2012 |language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; Portuguese,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isa%C3%ADas+14%3A12-17&amp;version=AA |title=Isaías 14:12–17 |publisher=Biblegateway.com |accessdate=23 December 2012 |language=Portuguese}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Spanish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah%2014:12&amp;version=LBLA |title=Isaías 14:12 |publisher=Biblegateway.com |accessdate=23 December 2012|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even the Vulgate text in Latin is printed with lower-case ''lucifer'' (morning star), not upper-case ''Lucifer'' (proper name).&lt;ref name="Vulgate Latin: Isaiah Chapter 14"/&gt;

[[John Calvin|Calvin]] said: "The exposition of this passage, which some have given, as if it referred to Satan, has arisen from ignorance: for the context plainly shows these statements must be understood in reference to the king of the Babylonians."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Calvin |first=John |others=Translated by John King |title=Commentary on Isaiah |volume=I:404 |date=2007 |publisher=Forgotten Books |location=Charleston, S.C.}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Martin Luther|Luther]] also considered it a gross error to refer this verse to the devil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ridderbos |first=Jan |others=Translated by John Vriend |title=The Bible Student’s Commentary: Isaiah |page=142 |date=1985 |publisher=Regency |location=Grand Rapids, Michigan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bogomilism===
In the [[Bogomilism|Bogomil]] and [[Catharism|Cathar]] text ''Gospel of the secret supper'', Lucifer is a glorified angel and the older brother of [[Jesus]], but fell from heaven to establish his own kingdom and became the [[Demiurge]].

=== Latter-day Saints ===
Lucifer is regarded within [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] as the [[Mormon cosmology#Pre-mortality|pre-mortal]] name of the devil. [[Beliefs and practices of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|Mormon theology]] teaches that in a [[Mormon cosmology#Council in Heaven|heavenly council]], Lucifer rebelled against the plan of [[God in Mormonism|God the Father]] and was subsequently cast out.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://eom.byu.edu/index.php/Lucifer|title=Devils – Encyclopedia of Mormonism|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mormon scripture reads:&lt;blockquote&gt;"And this we saw also, and bear record, that an angel of God who was in authority in the presence of God, who rebelled against the Only Begotten Son whom the Father loved and who was in the bosom of the Father, was thrust down from the presence of God and the Son, and was called Perdition, for the heavens wept over him—he was Lucifer, a son of the morning. And we beheld, and lo, he is fallen! is fallen, even a son of the morning! And while we were yet in the Spirit, the Lord commanded us that we should write the vision; for we beheld Satan, that old serpent, even the devil, who rebelled against God, and sought to take the kingdom of our God and his Christ—Wherefore, he maketh war with the saints of God, and encompasseth them round about."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/76.25-29?lang=eng#p24|title=D&amp;C 76:25–29|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;After becoming Satan by his fall, Lucifer "goeth up and down, to and fro in the earth, seeking to destroy the souls of men".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/10.27?lang=eng|title=D&amp;C 10:27|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mormons consider Isaiah 14:12 to be referring to both the king of the Babylonians and the devil.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.lds.org/scriptures/gs/lucifer?lang=eng|title=Lucifer - lds.org|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.lds.org/scriptures/ot/isa/14.12?lang=eng|title=Isaiah 14:12, footnote c|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other uses===
{{see also|Biblical apocrypha|New Testament apocrypha|Pseudepigrapha|Second Temple Judaism}}
Other instances of ''lucifer'' in the [[list of Old Testament pseudepigrapha|Old Testament pseudepigrapha]] are related to the "star" [[Venus]], in the [[Sibylline Oracles]] battle of the constellations (line 517) "Lucifer fought mounted on the back of Leo",&lt;ref&gt;Charlesworth Vol.1 p. 405 Sibylline Oracles line 517 "Lucifer fought mounted on the back of Leo"&lt;/ref&gt; or the entirely rewritten Christian version of the [[Greek Apocalypse of Ezra]] 4:32 which has a reference to Lucifer as [[Antichrist]].&lt;ref&gt;p. 567 Greek Apocalypse of Ezra Antichrist "the 'Lucifer' theme (4:32)&lt;/ref&gt;

{{bibleverse||Isaiah|14:12}} is not the only place where the Vulgate uses the word ''lucifer''. It uses the same word four more times, in contexts where it clearly has no reference to a fallen angel: {{bibleverse|2|Peter|1:19}} (meaning "morning star"), {{Bibleverse||Job|11:17}} ("the light of the morning"), {{bibleverse||Job|38:32}} ("the signs of the zodiac") and {{bibleverse||Psalms|110:3}} ("the dawn").&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09410a.htm Anthony Maas, "Lucifer" in ''Catholic Encyclopedia'' (New York 1910)]&lt;/ref&gt; ''Lucifer'' is not the only expression that the Vulgate uses to speak of the morning star: three times it uses ''stella matutina'': {{Bibleverse||Sirach|50:6}} (referring to the actual morning star), and {{bibleverse||Revelation|2:28}} (of uncertain reference) and {{bibleverse-nb||Revelation|22:16}} (referring to [[Jesus]]).

Indications that in Christian tradition the Latin word ''lucifer'', unlike the English word, did not necessarily call a fallen angel to mind exist also outside the text of the Vulgate. Two bishops bore that name: Saint [[Lucifer of Cagliari]], and [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Siena-Colle di Val d'Elsa-Montalcino#Bishops of Siena|Lucifer of Siena]].

In Latin, the word is applied to [[John the Baptist]] and is used as a title of Jesus himself in several early Christian hymns. The morning hymn ''Lucis largitor splendide'' of [[Hilary of Poitiers|Hilary]] contains the line: "''Tu verus mundi lucifer''" (you are the true light bringer of the world).&lt;ref&gt;March, Francis Andrew ''Latin Hymns with English Notes'', Douglass Series of Christian Greek and Latin Writers. Vol.1 Latin Hymns. Notes p218 "Lucifer: God – Christ is here addressed as the true light bringer, in distinction from the planet Venus. Such etymological turns are common in the hymns. Lucifer is a familiar epithet of John the Baptist in the early church, as well as of the "Son of the morning," mentioned in Isaiah xiv., ... This description of the King of Babylon was applied by Tertullian and others to Satan, and the mistake has led to the present meanings of Lucifer. See Webster's Dictionary."&lt;/ref&gt; Some interpreted the mention of the morning star (''lucifer'') in [[Ambrose]]'s hymn ''Aeterne rerum conditor'' as referring allegorically to Jesus and the mention of the cock, the herald of the day (''praeco'') in the same hymn as referring to John the Baptist.&lt;ref&gt;March Notes p224 "Lucifer: this the lovers of allegory interpreted of Christ, making John the Baptist the ''praeco''."&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, in the medieval hymn ''Christe qui lux es et dies'', some manuscripts have the line "Lucifer lucem proferens".&lt;ref&gt;March Notes p235 "For the use of Lucifer for Christ, see Hilary's hymn as above".&lt;/ref&gt;

The Latin word ''lucifer'' is also used of Jesus in the [[Exsultet|Easter Proclamation]] prayer to God regarding the [[paschal candle]]: ''Flammas eius lucifer matutinus inveniat: ille, inquam, lucifer, qui nescit occasum. Christus Filius tuus, qui, regressus ab inferis, humano generi serenus illuxit, et vivit et regnat in saecula saeculorum'' ("May this flame be found still burning by the Morning Star: the one Morning Star who never sets, Christ your Son, who, coming back from death's domain, has shed his peaceful light on humanity, and lives and reigns for ever and ever"). In the works of Latin grammarians, Lucifer, like Daniel, was discussed as an example of a personal name.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=kDi9rHgh8lYC&amp;pg=PA66&amp;dq=Amsler+Lucifer+%22proper+name%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=fjFUUp-JGdKGhQfD6YHwBA&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Amsler%20Lucifer%20%22proper%20name%22&amp;f=false Mark Amsler, ''Etymology and Grammatical Discourse in Late Antiquity and the Early Middle Ages'' (John Benjamins 1989)] {{ISBN|978-9-02724527-4}}, p. 66&lt;/ref&gt;

==In Occultism==
===Anthroposophy===
[[Rudolf Steiner]]'s writings, which formed the basis for [[Anthroposophy]], characterised Lucifer as a spiritual opposite to [[Ahriman]], with [[Christ]] between the two forces, mediating a balanced path for humanity. Lucifer represents an intellectual, imaginative, delusional, otherworldly force which might be associated with visions, subjectivity, psychosis and fantasy. He associated Lucifer with the religious/philosophical cultures of Egypt, Rome and Greece. Steiner believed that Lucifer, as a supersensible Being, had incarnated in China about 3000 years before the birth of Christ.

===Luciferianism===
[[Luciferianism]] is a belief system that venerates the essential characteristics that are affixed to Lucifer. The tradition, influenced by [[Gnosticism]], usually reveres Lucifer not as the devil, but as a liberator, a guardian or guiding spirit&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Vampires in Their Own Words: An Anthology of Vampire Voices |author=[[Michelle Belanger]] |publisher=[[Llewellyn Worldwide]] |date=2007 |page=175 |isbn=0-73871220-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; or even the true god as opposed to [[Jehovah]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=An Encyclopedia of Occultism |author=Spence, L. |publisher=Carol Publishing |date=1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Anton LaVey]]'s ''[[The Satanic Bible]]'', Lucifer is one of the [[The Book of Abramelin|four crown princes of hell]], particularly that of the East, the 'lord of the [[Air (classical element)|air]]', and is called the bringer of light, the morning star, intellectualism, and enlightenment.&lt;ref name=LaVey&gt;{{cite book|last=LaVey|first=Anton Szandor|title=The Satanic Bible|date=1969|publisher=Avon|location=New York|isbn=978-038001539-9|chapter=The Book of Lucifer: The Enlightenment}}&lt;/ref&gt; The title 'lord of the air' is based upon [[Ephesians]] 2:2, which uses the phrase 'prince of the power of the air' to refer to the pagan god [[Zeus]], but that phrase later became conflated with Satan.

Author Michael W. Ford has written on Lucifer as a "mask" of the adversary, a motivator and illuminating force of the mind and subconscious.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Bible of the Adversary|date=2007|publisher=Succubus Productions|page=8|chapter=Adversarial Doctrine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In Freemasonry===
[[Léo Taxil]] (1854–1907) claimed that [[Freemasonry]] is associated with worshipping Lucifer. In what is known as the [[Taxil hoax]], he alleged that leading Freemason [[Albert Pike]] had addressed "The 23 Supreme Confederated Councils of the world" (an invention of Taxil), instructing them that Lucifer was God, and was in opposition to the evil god [[Adonai]]. Supporters of Freemasonry contend that, when Albert Pike and other Masonic scholars spoke about the "Luciferian path," or the "energies of Lucifer," they were referring to the Morning Star, the light bearer,&lt;ref&gt;"Lucifer, the Son of the Morning! Is it ''he'' who bears the Light, and with its splendors intolerable blinds feeble, sensual, or selfish Souls? Doubt it not!" (Albert Pike, ''Morals and Dogma'', p. 321). Much has been made of this quote ([http://www.masonicinfo.com/lucifer.htm Masonic information: Lucifer]).&lt;/ref&gt; the search for light; the very antithesis of dark, satanic evil. Taxil promoted a book by Diana Vaughan (actually written by himself, as he later confessed publicly)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://freemasonry.bcy.ca/texts/taxil_confessed.html |title=Leo Taxil's confession |publisher=Grand Lodge of British Columbia and Yukon |date=2 April 2001 |accessdate=23 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; that purported to reveal a highly secret ruling body called the [[Palladists|Palladium]], which controlled the organization and had a satanic agenda. As described by ''Freemasonry Disclosed'' in 1897:
{{quote|With frightening cynicism, the miserable person we shall not name here [Taxil] declared before an assembly especially convened for him that for twelve years he had prepared and carried out to the end the most sacrilegious of hoaxes. We have always been careful to publish special articles concerning Palladism and Diana Vaughan. We are now giving in this issue a complete list of these articles, which can now be considered as not having existed.&lt;ref&gt;''Freemasonry Disclosed'' April 1897&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Taxil's work and Pike's address continue to be quoted by anti-masonic groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.masonicinfo.com/taxil.htm |title=Leo Taxil: The tale of the Pope and the Pornographer |accessdate=14 September 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Devil-Worship in France'', [[Arthur Edward Waite]] compared Taxil's work to today's [[Tabloid journalism|tabloid journalism]], replete with logical and factual inconsistencies.

===In Neopagan Witchcraft===
In a collection of folklore and magical practices supposedly collected in Italy by [[Charles Godfrey Leland]] and published in his ''[[Aradia, or the Gospel of the Witches]]'', the figure of Lucifer is featured prominently as both the brother and consort of the goddess [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]], and father of [[Aradia]], at the center of an alleged Italian witch-cult.&lt;ref name=aradia_sardinia/&gt;&lt;ref name=aradia_sardinia&gt;Magliocco, Sabina. (2009). Aradia in Sardinia: The Archaeology of a Folk Character. Pp. 40-60 in ''Ten Years of Triumph of the Moon''. Hidden Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt; In Leland's mythology, Diana pursued her brother Lucifer across the sky as a cat pursues a mouse. According to Leland, after dividing herself into light and darkness:
:"...Diana saw that the light was so beautiful, the light which was her other half, her brother Lucifer, she yearned for it with exceeding great desire. Wishing to receive the light again into her darkness, to swallow it up in rapture, in delight, she trembled with desire. This desire was the Dawn. But Lucifer, the light, fled from her, and would not yield to her wishes; he was the light which files into the most distant parts of heaven, the mouse which flies before the cat."&lt;ref name=aradia&gt;Charles G. Leland, ''Aradia: The Gospel of Witches'', Theophania Publishing, US, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Here, the motions of Diana and Lucifer once again mirror the celestial motions of the moon and Venus, respectively.&lt;ref name=stregheria&gt;Magliocco, Sabina. (2006). [https://www.academia.edu/584607/Italian_American_Stregheria_and_Wicca_Ethnic_ambivalence_in_American_Neopaganism Italian American Stregheria and Wicca: Ethnic Ambivalence in American Neopaganism]. Pp. 55-86 in Michael Strmiska, ed., ''Modern Paganism in World Cultures: Comparative Perspectives''. Santa Barbara, CA: ABC-Clio.&lt;/ref&gt; Though Leland's Lucifer is based on the classical personification of the planet Venus, he also incorporates elements from Christian tradition, as in the following passage: 
:"Diana greatly loved her brother Lucifer, the god of the Sun and of the Moon, the god of Light (Splendor), who was so proud of his beauty, and who for his pride was driven from Paradise."&lt;ref name=aradia/&gt;

In the several modern [[Wiccan]] traditions based in part on Leland's work, the figure of Lucifer is usually either omitted or replaced as Diana's consort with either the Etruscan god [[Tagni]], or Dianus ([[Janus]], following the work of folklorist [[James Frazer]] in ''The Golden Bough'').&lt;ref name=aradia_sardinia/&gt;

[[File:MIMA MOUNDS.jpg|thumb|350px|Mima mounds in Washington State]]

'''Mima mounds''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|m|aɪ|m|ə}} are low, flattened, circular to oval, domelike, natural mounds that are composed of loose, unstratified, often gravelly sediment that is an overthickened [[Soil horizon#A horizon|A horizon]]. These mounds range in diameter from 3 to more than 50&amp;nbsp;m; in height 30&amp;nbsp;cm to greater than 2&amp;nbsp;m; and in density from several to greater than 50 mounds per hectare, at times forming conspicuous [[patterns in nature|natural patterns]]. Mima mounds can be seen at the [[Mima Mounds Natural Area Preserve]] in Washington State.

Theories for the origin of Mima mounds include burrowing by [[pocket gopher]]s; accumulation of wind-blown ([[aeolian processes|aeolian]]) sediments around vegetation to form coppice dunes or [[nebkha]]s; [[seismic]] ground shaking by major earthquakes, though none have been observed to form Mima mounds; and shrinking and swelling of clays in hog-wallow or [[gilgai]] landforms.

Though the definitive Mima mounds are common in North America, it has not been shown that all North American mounds result from the same causes. Similar or at least reminiscent phenomena occur on all continents and the proposed causes do not occur in all regions that have been studied.&lt;ref name=BBC /&gt; Nor is it clear that all such mounds really are the same, either physically or functionally; for example, the so-called [[Fairy circle (Africa)|fairy circles]] of Southern Africa tend to be less mound-like and occur in different climatic and ecological conditions.&lt;ref&gt;Cramer MD, Barger NN (2013) Are Namibian “Fairy Circles” the Consequence of Self-Organizing Spatial Vegetation Patterning? PLoS ONE 8(8): e70876. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0070876&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, it has been argued that the possibly distinct [[heuweltjie]]s of the South Western Cape region of South Africa are of an origin far different from either.&lt;ref name="BurnhamJohnson2012"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Burnham, Jennifer L.

==Distribution==
Within the northwestern United States, Mima mounds typically are part of what is commonly known as hog-wallow landscape. This type of landscape typically has a shallow basement layer such as [[bedrock]], [[hardpan]], [[claypan]], or densely bedded gravel. In the northwestern United States, Mima mounds also occur within landscapes where a permanent water table impedes drainage, creating waterlogged soil conditions for prolonged periods. Mima mounds are named after the Mima Prairie in [[Thurston County, Washington|Thurston County]], Washington.&lt;ref name="Cox1984a"&gt;Cox, G.W., 1984a. ''Mounds of mystery.'' Natural History. v. 93, no. 6, pp. 36–45.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cox1984b"&gt;Cox, G.W., 1984b, ''The Distribution and Origin of Mima Mound Grasslands in San Diego County, California.'' Ecology. v. 65, no. 5, pp. 1397-1405.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jackson1997"&gt;Jackson, J.A., 1997, Glossary of Geology. American Geological Institute. Alexandria, Virginia.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Washburn1988a"&gt;Washburn, A.L., 1988, ''Mima mounds: an evaluation of proposed origins with special reference to the Puget Lowland.'' Report of Investigations, vol. 29. Washington Division of Geology and Earth Resources, Olympia, Washington.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mima mounds occur outside the northwestern United States in three major regions west of the [[Mississippi River]] as illustrated by Cox&lt;ref name="Cox1984a"/&gt; and Washburn.&lt;ref name="Washburn1988a"/&gt; First, they are found in a strip consisting of northwest [[Baja California]], western and north central [[California]], and south central Oregon where they are typically known as "hogwallow mounds". Within this strip and the area of [[San Diego]], they are often an integral part of the local vernal pool landscape.&lt;ref name="Cox1984b"/&gt; Second, they are found in a roughly north-south strip of the Great Plains containing parts of north central [[New Mexico]], and central [[Colorado]], and central [[Wyoming]] where they are typically called "prairie mounds". Third, they are found in an area containing parts of east [[Texas]], western [[Louisiana]], southeast [[Oklahoma]], and southern [[Missouri]] where they are commonly known as either "pimple mounds" or "prairie mounds". Finally, isolated patches of Mima mounds also are found in [[Iowa]], eastern [[North Dakota]], and northwest [[Minnesota]].&lt;ref name="Cox1984a"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Washburn1988a"/&gt;

Within Louisiana, Missouri, Oklahoma, and Texas, pimple mounds, also called locally "prairie mounds" and "natural mounds", consist of low, flattened, circular to oval, domelike, mounds composed of loose, sandy loam or loamy sand. Typically, these mounds consist entirely of a thickened loamy and sandy [[Soil horizon|A and E horizons]] lying either on a more or less flat or slightly, but noticeably depressed, clayey [[Soil horizon|B horizon]]. Pimple mounds range in diameter from 6 m to more than 45 m; in height 30&amp;nbsp;cm to greater than 1.2 m; and in density from several to greater than 425 mounds per hectare. Unlike the Mima mounds of Oregon and Washington, pimple mounds are not limited to the relatively flat and poorly drained surfaces, i.e. late [[Pleistocene]] coastal and fluvial terraces. They also occur in abundance of the slopes, summits and crests of hills created by the deep erosion and dissection of unconsolidated and unlithified early Pleistocene and middle Pleistocene, [[Pliocene]], and older coastal plain sediments. Rarely, pimple mounds that occur on these hillslopes are elongated in an upslope-downslope direction.&lt;ref name="Carty1980"&gt;Carty, D.

Murray, 1952, ''Geology of Beauregard and Allen Parishes.'' Geological Bulletin no. 27. Louisiana Geological Survey, Baton Rouge.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==
Excavations made into the Washington mounds show that underneath a blanket of prairie grass lies a mixture of loose sand, fine gravel, and decayed plants. Not all mima mound features have the same structure though. One mound in Washington had a very complex soil profile: A horizon is a black sandy loam (due to charcoal content from aboriginal burning on the prairies), B horizon is a gravelly sandy loam, C horizon is an extremely gravelly sand.&lt;ref&gt;United States Dept. of Agriculture, 1990. Soil Survey of Thurston County, Washington. 283 p.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Vernal pools==
[[Vernal pool]]s are shallow surficial depressions that seasonally fill with water during winter and spring rains and dry up during dry summer months. They get their name from the recognition of the seasonality of the habitat and the springtime flora associated with them. Vernal pools form where an impermeable or very slowly permeable layer underlies small and shallow depressions and creates a perched water table. The impermeable or very slowly permeable layer typically consists of either soil horizons such as duripans or claypans or bedrock in the form of volcanic mud or lava flows.&lt;ref name="BauderOthers2009a"&gt;Bauder, E.T., A.J. Bohonak, B. Hecht, M.A. Simovich, D. Shaw, D.G. Jenkins, and M. Rains. (2009) ''A Draft Regional Guidebook for Applying the Hydrogeomorphic Approach to Assessing Wetland Functions of Vernal Pool Depressional Wetlands in Southern California.'' San Diego State University, San Diego, California&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="RiefnerOthers1996a"&gt;Riefner, R.E. and D.R. Pryor. (1996) ''New locations and interpretations of vernal pools in Southern California.'' Phytologia. 80(4):296-327.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SmithOthers1998a"&gt;Smith, D.W., and W.L. Verrill (1998) ''Vernal Pool-Soil-Landform Relationships in the Central Valley, California.'' in: C.W. Witham, E.T. Bauder, D. Belk, W.R. Ferren Jr., and R. Ornduff, eds., pp. 15-23, Ecology, Conservation, and Management of Vernal Pool Ecosystems – Proceedings from a 1996 Conference. California Native Plant Society, Sacramento, California.&lt;/ref&gt;

Within California, vernal pools are quite commonly associated with Mima Mounds. These Mima Mounds are typically located on stable landforms that are greater than 100,000 years old. These landforms are characterized by strongly developed soils that usually have a relatively impermeable layer (claypan or silcrete duripan) in the subsoil. This impermeable layer locally impedes drainage and creates perched water levels and causes the formation of vernal pools within the intermound depressions that are associated with Mima Mounds. Vernal pools are typically small, shallow, and complex ephemeral wetlands that only have internal drainage because they are hydrologically isolated from perennial inflow by a ring of Mima Mounds. Although the ponded water that fills vernal pools comes and goes throughout the year, it is present at least for a short time in most years.&lt;ref name="BauderOthers2009a"/&gt;&lt;ref name="RiefnerOthers1996a"/&gt;&lt;ref name="RiefnerOthers2007a"&gt;Riefner, R.E., S. Boyd, and R.J. Shlemon (2007) ''Notes on native vascular plants from mima mound-vernal pool terrain and the importance of preserving coastal terraces in Orange County, California.'' Aliso. 24:19-28.&lt;/ref&gt; However, within California, the mound-depression microrelief associated with Mima Mounds is just one of a variety of geographic settings within which vernal pools occur. For example, in the Modoc Plateau region of California, numerous vernal pools are found on the surface of volcanic mudflows and basalt lava flows where Mima Mounds are completely absent.&lt;ref name="KellerWolfOthers1998a"&gt;Keeler-Wolf, T., D.R. Elam, K. Lewis, S.A. Flint (1998) ''California Vernal Pool Assessment Preliminary Report.'' Department of Fish and Game, State of California, Sacramento, California.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theories==
[[Image:MimaMoundsWA3.jpg|thumb|[[Washington Department of Natural Resources|DNR]] sign at [[Mima Mounds Natural Area Preserve]] near [[Olympia, Washington|Olympia]]]]

===Pocket gophers===
One theory on the origin of Mima mounds is that they were created by small burrowing rodents such as [[pocket gopher]]s (''[[Thomomys talpoides]]'') of the endemic North American family ''[[Geomyidae]]''. Researchers in the 1940s found that Mima mounds tend to form in areas with poorly draining soils, so the "Fossorial Rodent Hypothesis" proposed that gophers build mounds as an evolutionary response to low water tables.&lt;ref&gt;Dalquest &amp; Scheffer, 1942, The origin of Mima mounds of western Washington, Journal of Geology 50:68-84&lt;/ref&gt; It could be argued that gophers live in the mounds opportunistically but did not build them. Metal tracers implanted in a Mima mound field in San Diego demonstrated that gophers unexpectedly pushed soil upwards towards the center of the mounds instead of pushing the soil downward.&lt;ref&gt;Cox &amp; Allen, 1987, Soil translocation by pocket gophers in a Mima moundfield, Oecologia 72:207-210.&lt;/ref&gt; This uphill soil transport contrasts with the typical gopher behavior of pushing soil downhill but can be overridden when soil is saturated. Consequently, gophers in mima mound fields seem to be aware of randomly distributed topographic highs and orient their burrowing accordingly in early mound creation stages. However, the mounds were already fully formed and the gophers may have just been maintaining them. Nevertheless, the fact that the surface area of a typical Mima mound is similar to the size of an individual gopher's home range is consistent with the theory they were constructed by the rodents.&lt;ref name="Gabet 2014"&gt;Gabet et al., 2014, Biotic origin for Mima mounds supported by numerical model, Geomorphology 206:58-66.&lt;/ref&gt; Results from the tracer study were incorporated into a numerical model that simulated the burrowing behavior of gophers. The advantage of modelling in this case is that (1) an initially flat surface can be specified, and (2) time can be sped up. In the computer simulations, mounds naturally emerged from randomly distributed topographic highs, and reached topographic steady state after several centuries of gopher activity, which could explain why nobody has ever witnessed the growth of one. Once the mound field reaches topographic maturity, the mounds feature more uniform spacing and hexagonal tessellation. Results indicated that formation of these mound fields are largely contributed by [[positive feedback loop]]s which amplify small features to create [[fractal|large scale patterns]], a common facet of [[self-organization]]. The slow modeled mound growth rates and their spatial distribution agreed with field observations. Although occupation of mounds by gophers does not by itself prove that gophers built the mounds since they could be living there opportunistically, to date, this is the strongest evidence for the origin of these enigmatic features.&lt;ref name="Gabet 2014"/&gt;

The publication of this modelling study received attention from the international press.&lt;ref name=BBC&gt;{{cite web| author=Morelle, Rebecca | title='Digital gophers' solve Mima mound mystery | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-25259133 | publisher=BBC | accessdate=9 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aeolian origin===
Another major theory concerning the origin of pimple and prairie mounds argues that they are either coppice dunes or [[nebkha]]s formed by the accumulation of wind-blown sediments around clumps of vegetation. For example, based on grain-size data of and optically stimulated luminescence ages obtained from pimple mounds in the south-central United States, Seifert and others&lt;ref name="SeifertOthers2009"&gt;Seifert, C.L., R.T. Cox, S.L. Forman, T.L. Foti, T.A. Wasklewicz, and A.T. McColgan (2009) ''Relict nebkhas (pimple mounds) record prolonged late Holocene drought in the forested region of south-central United States.'' Quaternary Research. 71(3):29-339.&lt;/ref&gt; concluded that these mounds consisted of wind blown sediments that accumulated during prolonged late [[Holocene]] droughts. They suggest that although they superficially resemble the mima mounds of the northwestern United States, the pimple mounds of south-central America have a greatly different origin from them.

===Seismic activity===
Andrew Berg, a geologist with the U.S. Bureau of Mines in Spokane, proposed that Mima and pimple mounds were the result of very intense ground shaking resulting from major earthquakes.&lt;ref name=bergseismic&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1130/0091-7613(1990)018|author=Berg, A.W.|title= Formation of Mima Mounds, A seismic hypothesis|publisher=Geology|volume=18|issue=3|pages=281–285|date=March 1990|url=http://geology.geoscienceworld.org/cgi/content/abstract/18/3/281|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; He formulated this hypothesis while building a dog house.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=A Theory on Those Mysterious Mounds / Geology: Odd features on American landscape have long been a puzzle. A researcher says they are related to earthquakes|date=June 24, 1990|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1990-06-24/news/mn-622_1_american-landscape|accessdate=2010-05-10|author=Linda Ashton|publisher=Los Angeles Times|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; As he hammered together sheets of plywood coated with volcanic ash, he noticed that the hammering vibrations caused the ash to heap into small mounds that looked a lot like miniature Mima mounds.  From that observation, Berg hypothesized that vibrations from violent earthquakes could have formed the Mima mounds. According to Berg, the soil on the Mima Prairie is like volcanic ash, and the layer of rock below that is like a plank of wood. When [[seismic wave]]s move through the hard ground and bump into faults, or large fractures in the ground, the waves bounce backward. Those ricocheted waves collide with other seismic waves from the quake, and between the collision points, the soil rises and forms mounds.  Berg claims that Mima mounds occur only in seismically active areas—areas where the ground is unstable and many earthquakes occur. The area where the Washington Mima mounds are found experienced a major earthquake about 1,000 years ago.

However, since this hypothesis has been proposed, there have been many large earthquakes throughout the world and none have been reported to have formed Mima mounds. In addition, Mima mounds have been gradually growing on the Carrizo Plain (California) since the 1980s when plowing of the fields was halted. These mounds have been forming in the absence of any large earthquakes.&lt;ref name="Gabet 2014"/&gt; Therefore, there is no geological evidence supporting the 'earthquake' hypothesis.

===Shrinking and swelling of clays===
 
When clay is exposed to large amounts of water, the water collects between the clay minerals (which are flat planes). Due to the shape of the minerals, the water travels in between the compacted layer, thus "swelling" the clay-bed into mound-like features.
Silts are also related with this geomorphologic feature; however, silt is coarser-grained sediment so the minerals do not "hold" water in the same way. Silt is more penetrable than clay is.&lt;ref&gt;Quaternary Research Center [http://www.washington.edu/qrc/mimahelentour Mt. St. Helens and Mima Mounds Tour]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} accessed December 1, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Shrink/swell soils are most often related to landforms called "hog wallows" or "[[gilgai]]" that can look similar to mima mounds.

===Nature Paper explanation===
In 2017, Corina Tarnita and several of her colleagues published a paper in [[Nature (journal)|''Nature'']] which explained these and other related self-organised vegetation patterns by means of a general theory which integrates scale-dependent feedbacks and the activities of subterranean ecosystem engineers such as termites, ants, and rodents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1=Corina E.|last1=Tarnita|first2=Juan A.|last2=Bonachela|first3=Efrat|last3=Sheffer|first4=Jennifer A.|last4=Guyton|title=A theoretical foundation for multi-scale regular vegetation patterns|url=http://strathprints.strath.ac.uk/59574/1/Tarnita_et_al_Nature2017_theoretical_foundation_for_multi_scale_regular_vegetation.pdf|journal=Nature|pages=398–401|volume=541|issue=7637|doi=10.1038/nature20801|first5=Tyler C.|last5=Coverdale|first6=Ryan A.|last6=Long|first7=Robert M.|last7=Pringle}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Washington==
The phenomenon can be seen at the [[Mima Mounds Natural Area Preserve]], a designated [[National Natural Landmark]] near [[Capitol State Forest]] in Thurston County, Washington. Mima mounds are also present at the [[Scatter Creek Unit]], located in southern Thurston County, Washington.

== Approach ==

The project uses a [[supertree]] approach to generate a single phylogenetic tree (served at tree.opentreeoflife.org&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://tree.opentreeoflife.org/|title=opentree|first=Open Tree of Life developers|last=&lt;mtholder@gmail.com&gt;|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;) from a comprehensive [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]] and a curated set of published phylogenetic estimates.

The taxonomy is a combination of several large classifications produced by other projects; it is created using a software tool called "smasher"
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Rees JA, Cranston K | title = Automated assembly of a reference taxonomy for phylogenetic data synthesis | journal = Biodiversity Data Journal | volume = 5 | issue = 5 | pages = e12581 | date = 2017 | pmid = 28765728 | pmc = 5515096 | doi = 10.3897/BDJ.5.e12581 | url = https://bdj.pensoft.net/articles.php?id=12581 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The resulting taxonomy is called an Open Tree Taxonomy (OTT) and can be browsed on-line.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://tree.opentreeoflife.org/taxonomy/browse | title = tree.opentreeoflife.org }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

The project was started in June 2012 with a three-year [[National Science Foundation|NSF]] award to researchers at ten universities. In 2015, a two-year supplemental award was made to researchers at three institutions.

{{refimprove|date=November 2015}}

'''Peak minerals''' marks the point in time when the largest production of a mineral will occur in an area, with production declining in subsequent years. While most mineral resources will not be exhausted in the near future, global extraction and production is becoming more challenging.&lt;ref&gt;Mudd, G M, 2010, The Environmental Sustainability of Mining in Australia: Key Mega-Trends and Looming Constraints. Resources Policy, {{doi|10.1016/j.resourpol.2009.12.001}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Miners have found ways over time to extract deeper and lower grade ores&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

More than anything else, declining average ore grades are indicative of ongoing technological shifts that have enabled inclusion of more 'complex' processing – in social and environmental terms ''as well as'' economic – and structural changes in the minerals exploration industry&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Schodde|first1=Richard C|title=Exploration trends, finds and issues in Australia|url=http://www.minexconsulting.com/publications/nov2015.html|website=External Presentations and Publications|publisher=MinEx Consulting|accessdate=3 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and these have been accompanied by significant increases in identified Mineral Reserves.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=West|first=J|date=2011|title=Decreasing metal ore grades: are they really being driven by the depletion of high-grade deposits?|url=|journal=J Ind Ecol  |volume=15 |issue=2 |pages=165–68|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Drielsma|first1=Johannes A|last2=Russell-Vaccari|first2=Andrea J|last3=Drnek|first3=Thomas|last4=Brady|first4=Tom|last5=Weihed|first5=Pär|last6=Mistry|first6=Mark|last7=Perez Simbor|first7=Laia|title=Mineral resources in life cycle impact assessment – defining the path forward|journal=Int J Life Cycle Assess|date=2016|volume=21|pages=85–105|doi=10.1007/s11367-015-0991-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Definition ==
The concept of peak minerals offers a useful model for representing the changing impacts associated with processing declining resource qualities in the lead up to, and following, peak mineral production in a particular region within a certain time-frame.&lt;ref&gt;Giurco, D., Prior, T., Mudd, G., Mason, L. and Behrisch, J. (2009). Peak minerals in Australia: a review of changing impacts and benefits. Prepared for CSIRO Minerals Down Under Flagship, by the Institute for Sustainable Futures (University of Technology, Sydney) and Department of Civil Engineering (Monash University), March 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Peak minerals provides an analytical framework within which the economic, social and environmental trajectories of a particular [[Mining|mining industry]] can be explored in relation to the continuing (and often increasing) production of [[Mineral resource classification|mineral resources]]. It focuses consideration on the change in costs and impacts associated with processing easily accessible, lower cost ores before peak production of an individual mine or group of mines for a given mineral. It outlines how the economy might respond as [[Mineral processing|processing]] becomes characterised by higher costs as the peak is approached and passed. Issues associated with the concept of peak minerals include:
* Average processed ore grades are in global decline for some minerals whilst production is increasing.
* Average ''discovered''  ore grades (e.g., in porphyry copper deposits) have remained remarkably steady over the last 150 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Drielsma|authorlink1=Indicators of Resource Depletion: Views of the Mining Industries|editor1-last=Mancini|editor1-first=L|editor2-last=De Camillis|editor2-first=C|editor3-last=Pennington|editor3-first=D|title=Security of supply and scarcity of raw materials.

=== Resource depletion and recoverability ===
{{See also | Recycling #Energy and material flows | Mining #Metal reserves and recycling}}
Giurco et al. (2009)&lt;ref name="Giurco, D. 2009"&gt;Giurco, D., Evans, G., Cooper, C., Mason, L. &amp; Franks, D. (2009) "Mineral Futures Discussion Paper: Sustainability Issues, Challenges and Opportunities". Institute for Sustainable Futures, UTS and Sustainable Minerals Institute, University of Queensland.&lt;/ref&gt; indicate that the debate about how to analytically describe [[resource depletion]] is ongoing. Traditionally, a fixed stock paradigm has been applied, but Tilton and Lagos (2007)&lt;ref&gt;Tilton, J. &amp; Lagos, G. (2007) "Assessing the long-run availability of copper." ''Resources Policy'', 32, 19–23&lt;/ref&gt; suggest using an [[opportunity cost]] paradigm is better because the usable resource quantity is represented by price and the opportunity cost of using the resource. Unlike energy minerals such as coal or oil – or minerals used in a dissipative or [[Metabolism|metabolic]] fashion like [[phosphorus]]&lt;ref&gt;Cordell, D., Drangert, J.-O. &amp; White, S. (2009) "The story of phosphorus: Global food security and food for thought". ''Global Environmental Change'', 19, 292–305.&lt;/ref&gt; – most non-energy minerals and metals are unlikely to run out. Metals are inherently [[Recycling|recyclable]] and more readily recoverable from end uses where the metal is used in a pure form and not transformed or dissipated; in addition, metal ore is accessible at a range of different grades. So, although metals are not facing exhaustion, they are becoming more challenging to obtain in the quantities that society demands, and the energy, environmental and social cost of acquiring them could constrain future increases in production and usage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Meinert|first1=Lawrence D|last2=Robinson|first2=Gilpin R Jr|last3=Nassar|first3=Nedal T|title=Mineral Resources: Reserves, Peak Production and the Future|journal=resources|date=2016|volume=5|issue=14|doi=10.3390/resources5010014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Peak oil ===
Given increasing global population and rapidly growing consumption (especially in China and India), frameworks for the analysis of [[resource depletion]] can assist in developing appropriate responses. The most popular contemporary focus for resource depletion is oil (or petroleum) resources. In 1956, oil geologist [[M. King Hubbert]] famously predicted that conventional oil production from the lower 48 (mainland) states of the United States would peak by 1970 and then enter a terminal decline.&lt;ref&gt;Hubbert, M. K. (1956) ''Nuclear Energy and the Fossil Fuel. Drilling and Production Practice''.{{ISBN?}}&lt;/ref&gt; This model was accurate in predicting the peak (although the peak year was 1971). This phenomenon is now commonly called '[[peak oil]]', with peak production curves known as [[Hubbert curve|Hubbert Curves]].

The concept of peak minerals is an extrapolation and extension of Hubbert's model of peak oil. Although widely cited for his predictions of peak oil, Hubbert intended to explore an appropriate response to the finite supply of oil, and framed this work within the context of increasing global population and rapidly growing consumption of oil.

In establishing the peak oil model, Hubbert was primarily focused on arguing that a planned transition was required to ensure future energy services.

World gold production has experienced multiple peaks due to new discoveries and new technologies.  Many mineral resources have exhibited logistic Hubbert-type production trends in the past, but have transitioned to exponential growth during the last 10–15 years, precluding reliable estimates of reserves from within the framework of the logistic model.&lt;ref&gt;Rustad, J. R. (2011) Peak Nothing: Recent Trends in Mineral Resource Production https://arxiv.org/abs/1107.4753&lt;/ref&gt;

=== As extrapolating peak oil ===
Only limited substantive work is currently undertaken to examine how the concepts and assumptions of peak oil can be extrapolated so as to be applied to minerals in general.&lt;ref&gt;Heinberg, R. (2007). ''Peak Everything: Waking Up to the Century of Declines'', Gabriola Island, BC, Canada, New Society Publishers.{{ISBN?}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mudd, G. M. &amp; Ward, J. D. (2008) "Will Sustainability Constraints Cause 'Peak Minerals'?" 3rd International Conference on Sustainability Engineering and Science: Blueprints for Sustainable Infrastructure. Auckland, New Zealand&lt;/ref&gt; When extrapolating peak oil to account for peak minerals and then utilising this analytical 'peak framework' as a general model of resource exploitation, several factors must be taken into consideration:
*Accurate estimates of easily accessible proven reserves;
*Political and market stability;
*Affordable, stable prices for consumers and enticing profits for producers;
*Exponentially increasing consumption;
*Independent producers focused only on maximising their immediate profits;
*Perceived abundance of and availability of other reserves (e.g. US, Middle Eastern).
In understanding how these factors are important for modelling peak minerals, it is important to consider assumptions concerning the modelling process, assumptions about production (particularly economic conditions), and the ability to make accurate estimates of resource quantity and quality and the potential of future exploration.

== Cheap and easy in the past; costly and difficult in future ==
Peak production poses a problem for resource rich countries like Australia, which have developed a [[comparative advantage]] in the global resources sector, which may diminish in the future. The costs of mining, once primarily reflected in economic terms, are increasingly being considered in social and environmental terms, although these are yet to meaningfully inform long-term decision-making in the sector. Such consideration is particularly important if the industry is seeking to operate in a [[social sustainability|socially]], [[sustainability|environmentally]] and [[Sustainability#Economic dimension|economically]] sustainable manner into the next 30–50 years.&lt;ref name="Giurco, D. 2009"/&gt;

=== Benefits from dependence on the resource sector ===
In 2008–09, minerals and fuel exports made up around 56% of Australia’s total exports. Consequently, minerals play a major role in Australia’s capacity to participate in international trade and contribute to the international strength of its currency.&lt;ref&gt;AusI MM (2006) Australian Mineral Economics, Carlton, The Australian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy.
&lt;/ref&gt; Whether this situation contributes to Australia’s economic wealth or weakens its economic position is contested. While those supporting Australia’s reliance on minerals cite the theory of comparative advantage, opponents suggest a reliance on resources leads to issues associated with '[[Dutch disease]]' (a decline in other sectors of the economy associated with natural resource exploitation) and ultimately the hypothesised ‘[[resource curse]]’.

=== Threats from dependence on the resource sector ===
Contrary to the theory of the comparative advantage, many mineral resource-rich countries are often outperformed by resource-poor countries.&lt;ref&gt;Auty, R. M. &amp; Mikesell, R. F. (1998) ''Sustainable development in mineral economies'', Oxford, Oxford University {{ISBN?}}&lt;/ref&gt; This paradox, where natural resource abundance actually has a negative impact on the growth of the national economy is termed the resource curse. After an initial economic boost, brought on by the booming minerals economy, negative impacts linked to the boom surpass the positive, causing economic activity to fall below the pre-resource windfall level.

==== Mineral supply and demand ====
The economics of a commodity are generally determined by [[supply and demand]]. Mineral supply and demand will change dramatically as all costs (economic, technological, social and environmental) associated with production, processing and transportation of minerals increases with falling ore grades. These costs will ultimately influence the ability of companies to supply commodities, and the ability of consumers to purchase them. It is likely that social and environmental issues will increasingly drive economic costs associated with supply and demand patterns.&lt;ref&gt;Esteves, A. M. (2008) "Mining and social development: Refocusing community investment using multi-criteria decision analysis". Resources Policy, 33, 39–47.
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hamann, R. (2004) "Corporate social responsibility, partnerships, and institutional change: The case of mining companies in South Africa". Natural Resources Forum, 28, 278–90.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jenkins, H. 2006"&gt;Jenkins, H. &amp; Yakovleva, N. (2006) [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/223730765_Corporate_Social_Responsibility_in_the_Mining_Industry_Exploring_Trends_in_Social_and_Environmental_Disclosure Corporate social responsibility in the mining industry: Exploring trends in social and environmental disclosure]. Journal of Cleaner Production, 14, 271–84.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Economic scarcity as a constraint to mineral supply ====
As neither overall stocks nor future markets are known, most economists normally do not consider physical scarcity as a good indicator for the availability of a resource for society.&lt;ref&gt;Barnett, HJ, GM Van Muiswinkel and M. Schechter, (1981). "Are Minerals Costing More?" Int. Inst Appi. Syst. Anal., Work. Pap. No. WP-81-20. П ASA, Laxenburg, Austria&lt;/ref&gt; Economic scarcity has subsequently been introduced as a more valid approach to assess the supply of minerals. There are three commonly accepted measures for [[Scarcity|economic scarcity]]: the user costs associated with a resource, the real price of the resource, and the resource’s extraction costs. These measures have historically externalised impacts of a social or environmental nature – so might be considered inaccurate measures of economic scarcity given increased environmental or social scrutiny in the mining industry. Internalisation of these costs will contribute to economic scarcity by increasing the user costs, the real price of the resource, and its extraction costs.{{citation needed|date = August 2014}}

==== Demand for minerals ====
While the ability to supply a commodity determines its availability as has been demonstrated, demand for minerals can also influence their availability. How minerals are used, where they are distributed and how, trade barriers, downstream use industries, substitution and recycling can potentially influence the demand for minerals, and ultimately their availability. While economists are cognisant of the role of demand as an availability driver, historically they have not considered factors besides depletion as having a long-term impact on mineral availability.&lt;ref&gt;Yaksic, A. &amp; Tilton, J. E. (2009) "Using the cumulative availability curve to assess the threat of mineral depletion: The case of lithium". Resources Policy, 34(4): 185–94.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Future production ==
There are a variety of indicators that show production is becoming more difficult and more expensive. Key environmental indicators that reflect increasingly expensive production are primarily associated with the decline in average ore grades of many minerals.&lt;ref&gt;Mudd, G. M. (2007) "Gold mining in Australia: linking historical trends and environmental and resources sustainability". ''Environmental Science &amp; Policy'', 10, 629–44.&lt;/ref&gt; This has consequences in mineral exploration, for mine depth, the energy intensity of mining, and the increasing quantity of waste rock.

Adjusting to a higher energy intensity is challenging for the industry in light of peak oil and rising energy costs in a carbon constrained future.{{Citation needed|date=June 2017}}

Although new mineral deposits are still being discovered, and reserves are increasing for some minerals, these are of lower quality and are less accessible.{{Citation needed|date=June 2017}}

== Social context ==
Different social issues must be addressed through time in relation to peak minerals at a national scale, and other issues manifest on the local scale.

As global mining companies seek to expand operations to access larger mining areas, competition with farmers for land and for scare water is becoming increasingly intense.&lt;ref name="Jenkins, H. 2006"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hamann, R. (2003) "Mining companies' role in sustainable development: the 'why' and 'how' of corporate social responsibility from a business perspective". ''Development Southern Africa'', 20, 237–54.&lt;/ref&gt; Negative relationships with near neighbours influence companies' ability to establish and maintain a ''social license to operate'' within the community.&lt;ref&gt;Brereton, D., Moran, C. J., McIlwain, G., McIntosh, J. &amp; Parkinson, K. (2008) "Assessing the cumulative impacts of mining on regional communities: An exploratory study of coal mining in the Muswellbrook area of New South Wales". ACARP Project C14047, Centre for Social Responsibility in Mining, Centre for Water in the Minerals Industry, and the Australian Coal Association Research Program.&lt;/ref&gt;

Access to identified resources is becoming harder as questions are asked about the benefit from the regional economic development mining is reputed to bring.

'''''Psilotum''''' is a genus of [[fern]]-like [[vascular plant]]s, commonly known as '''whisk ferns'''. It is one of two [[Genus|genera]] in the [[Family (biology)|family]] [[Psilotaceae]], the other being ''[[Tmesipteris]]''. Plants in these two genera were once thought to be descended from the earliest surviving [[vascular plant]]s, but more recent phylogenies place them as basal ferns, as a sister group to [[Ophioglossales]].  They lack true roots and leaves, the stems being the organs containing conducting tissue. There are only two species in ''Psilotum'' and a hybrid between the two. They differ from those in ''Tmesipteris'' in having stems with many branches and a [[Sporangium#Synangium|synangium]] with three lobes rather than two.

==Description and life cycle==
Whisk ferns in the genus ''Psilotum'' lack true roots but are anchored by creeping [[rhizome]]s. The stems have many branches with paired [[enation]]s, which look like small leaves but have no [[vascular tissue]]. Above these enations there are synangia formed by the fusion of three [[Sporangium|sporangia]] and which produce the [[spore]]s. When mature, the synangia release yellow to whitish spores which develop into a [[gametophyte]] less than {{convert|2|mm|in|sigfig=1|abbr=on}} long. The gametophyte lives underground as a [[Saprotrophic nutrition|saprophyte]], sometimes in a [[mycorrhiza]]l association. When the gametophyte is mature, it produces both egg and sperm cells. The sperm cells swim using several [[Flagellum|flagella]] and when they reach an egg cell, unite with it to form the young [[sporophyte]]. A mature sporophyte may grow to a height of {{convert|30|cm|in|sigfig=1|abbr=on}} or more but lacks true leaves. The stem has a core of thick-walled [[Stele (biology)#Protostele|protostele]] in its centre surrounded by an [[endodermis]] which regulates the flow of water and nutrients. The surface of the stem is covered with [[stoma]]ta which allow gas exchange with the surroundings.&lt;ref name="Fairley"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fairley|first1=Alan|last2=Moore|first2=Philip|title=Native plants of the Sydney region : from Newcastle to Nowra and west to the Dividing Range|date=2010|publisher=Allen &amp; Unwin|location=Crows Nest, N.S.W.|isbn=9781741755718|page=16|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="UCMP"&gt;{{cite web|title=Introduction to the Psilotales|url=http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/plants/pterophyta/psilotales.html|publisher=University of California Museum of Paleontology|accessdate=24 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="RBGS"&gt;{{cite web|title=''Psilotum''|url=http://plantnet.rbgsyd.nsw.gov.au/cgi-bin/NSWfl.pl?page=nswfl&amp;showsyn=&amp;dist=&amp;constat=&amp;lvl=gn&amp;name=Psilotum|publisher=Royal botanic Gardens Sydney: plantnet|accessdate=24 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The gametophyte of ''Psilotum'' is unusual in that it branches dichotomously, lives underground and possesses vascular tissue.&lt;ref name="Holloway"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Holloway|first1=John E.|title=The Gametophyte, Embryo, and Young Rhizome of ''Psilotum triquetrum'' (Swartz)|journal=Annals of Botany|date=1939|volume=3|issue=2|pages=313–336}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The nutrition of the gametophyte appears to be [[myco-heterotrophs|myco-heterotrophic]], assisted by [[endophyte|endophytic]] [[fungi]].&lt;ref name="Manton"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Manton|first1=Irene|title=A Note on the Cytology of Psilotum with Special Reference to Vascular Prothalli from Rangitoto Island|journal=Annals of Botany|date=1942|volume=6|issue=2|pages=283–292}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Taxonomy and naming==
The genus ''Psilotum'' was first formally described in 1801 by [[Olof Swartz]] and the description was published in ''Journal fur die Botanik (Schrader)''.&lt;ref name=APNI&gt;{{cite web|title=''Psilotum''|url=https://id.biodiversity.org.au/instance/apni/508374|publisher=APNI|accessdate=24 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sw."&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Swartz|first1=Olof|last2=Schrader|first2=Heinrich Adolph (ed.)|title=Genera et species Filicum|journal=Journal fur die Botanik (Schrader)|date=1801|volume=2|page=109|url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=nyp.33433011408949;view=1up;seq=123|accessdate=24 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name of the genus is from the [[Ancient Greek]] word ''psilos'' meaning "bare", "smooth" or "bald"&lt;ref name="RWB"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brown|first1=Roland Wilbur|title=The Composition of Scientific Words|date=1956|publisher=Smithsonian Institution Press|location=Washington, D.C.|page =123}}&lt;/ref&gt; referring to the lack of the usual plant organs, such as leaves.&lt;ref name="NZPCN"&gt;{{cite web|last1=de Lange|first1=Peter James|title=''Psilotum nudum''|url=http://www.nzpcn.org.nz/flora_details.aspx?ID=2229|publisher=New Zealand Plant Conservation Network|accessdate=24 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Species and distribution==
There are two species, ''[[Psilotum nudum]]'' and ''[[Psilotum complanatum]]'', with a hybrid between them known, ''Psilotum'' × ''intermedium'' [[Warren H. Wagner|W. H. Wagner]].

The distribution of ''Psilotum'' is tropical and subtropical, in the [[New World]], [[Asia]], and the [[Pacific]], with a few isolated populations in south-west Europe. The highest latitudes known are in [[South Carolina]], [[Cádiz]] province in [[Spain]],&lt;ref name="Libro Rojo"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.mma.es/portal/secciones/biodiversidad/inventarios/inb/flora_vascular/pdf/1066.pdf | work = [[Atlas y Libro Rojo de la Flora Vascular Amenazada de España]] | title = Psilotum nudum}}&lt;/ref&gt; and southern [[Japan]] for ''P. nudum''.  In the U.S., ''P. nudum'' is found from Florida to Texas, and ''P. complanatum'' in Hawaii.

==Relation to ferns==
''Psilotum'' superficially resembles certain extinct early vascular plants, such as the [[rhyniophyte]]s and the trimerophyte genus ''Psilophyton''. The unusual features of ''Psilotum'' that suggest an affinity with early vascular plants include dichotomously branching sporophytes, aerial stems arising from horizontal rhizomes, a simple vascular cylinder, homosporous and terminal [[eusporangiate fern|eusporangia]] and a lack of roots.&lt;ref name=GiffordFoster&gt;{{cite book |last1=Gifford |first1=Ernest |title=Morphology and Evolution of Vascular Plants, Third Edition|year=1989|publisher=W.H. Freeman and Company|location=New York|isbn=0716719460|author2=Adriance Foster}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unfortunately, no fossils of psilophytes are known to exist. A careful study of the morphology and anatomy suggests that whisk ferns are not closely related to rhyniophytes, and that the ancestral features present in living psilophytes represent a reduction from a more typical modern fern plant. Significant differences between ''Psilotum'' and the rhyniophytes and trimerophytes are that the development of its vascular strand is [[xylem#development|exarch]], while it is [[xylem#development|centrarch]] in rhyniophytes and trimerophytes.&lt;ref name=Bell&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bell|first1=P.R.|last2=Hemsley|first2=P.R.|year=1992|title=Green plants, their origin and diversity|edition=second|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge, U.K.|isbn=0521646731}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sporangia of ''Psilotum'' are [[locule|trilocular]] synangia resulting from the fusion of three adjacent sporangia,&lt;ref name=Bell/&gt; and these are borne laterally on the axes.  In the rhyniophytes and trimerophytes the sporangia were single and in a terminal position on branches.&lt;ref name=Stewart&gt;{{cite book|last1=Stewart|first1=W.N.|last2=Rothwell|first2=G.W.|year=1993|edition=second|title=Palaeobotany and the evolution of plants|publisher=Cambridge university press|location=Cambridge, U.K.|isbn=0521382947}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Molecular evidence strongly confirms that ''Psilotum'' is a fern and that psilophytes are sister to ophioglossoid ferns.&lt;ref name=QiuandPalmer1999&gt;Qiu, Y-L and Palmer, J (1999) "Phylogeny of early land plants: insights from genes and genomes." Trends in Plant Science 4(1), 26-30&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23403">[[File:Radiant Barrier.png|thumb|'''Radiant barrier''' is a shiny, reflective building material used to reflect heat radiation.]]

A '''radiant barrier''' is a type of building product that reflects [[thermal radiation]] and reduces [[heat transfer]]. Since thermal energy is also transferred via [[Conduction (heat)|conduction]] and [[convection]], radiant barriers are often supplemented with [[thermal insulation]] products that slow down heat transfer via conduction or convection.

Radiant barrier reflects heat radiation (radiant heat), preventing transfer from one side to another due to a reflective, low [[Radiant emittance|emittance]] surface. In building applications, this surface is typically a very thin, mirror-like aluminum foil. The foil may be coated for resistance to the elements or for abrasion resistance. The radiant barrier may be one or two sided. One sided radiant barrier may be attached to insulating materials, such as [[polyisocyanate]], rigid foam, bubble insulation, or [[Oriented strand board|OSB]]. Additionally, reflective tape can be adhered to strips of radiant barrier to make it a contiguous [[vapor barrier]], alternatively, radiant barrier can be perforated for vapor transmittance.

==Reflectivity and emissivity==
All materials give off, or emit, energy by thermal radiation as a result of their temperature. The amount of energy radiated depends on the surface temperature and a property called [[emissivity]] (also called "emittance"). Emissivity is expressed as a number between zero (0) and one (1) at a given wavelength. The higher the emissivity, the greater the emitted radiation at that wavelength. A related material property is [[reflectivity]] (also called "reflectance"). This is a measure of how much energy is reflected by a material at a given wavelength. Reflectivity is also expressed as a number between 0 and 1 (or a percentage between 0 and 100). At a given wavelength and angle of incidence the emissivity and reflectivity values sum to 1 by [[Kirchhoff's law of thermal radiation|Kirchhoff's law]].{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

Radiant barrier materials must have low emissivity (usually 0.1 or less) at the wavelengths at which they are expected to function. For typical building materials, the wavelengths are in the mid- and long-infrared [[Electromagnetic spectrum|spectrum]], in the range of 3-15 micrometres.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

Radiant barriers may or may not exhibit high visual reflectivity. While reflectivity and emissivity must sum to 1 at a given wavelength, reflectivity at one set of wavelengths (visible) and emissivity at a different set of wavelengths (thermal) do not necessarily sum to 1. Therefore, it is possible to create visibly dark colored surfaces with low thermal emissivity.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

To perform properly, radiant barriers need to face open space (e.g., air or vacuum) through which there would otherwise be radiation.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

==History==
In 1860, the French scientist [[Jean Claude Eugene Peclet]]&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wilkes|first=Gordon B.|date=1939-07-01|title=Reflective Insulation|url=https://doi.org/10.1021/ie50355a011|journal=Industrial &amp; Engineering Chemistry|volume=31|issue=7|pages=832–838|doi=10.1021/ie50355a011|issn=0019-7866}}&lt;/ref&gt; experimented with the insulating effect of high and low emissive metals facing air spaces.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6pUAAAAAMAAJ&amp;lpg=PA63&amp;ots=4zu43Ok6Yx&amp;dq=Peclet%20tin&amp;pg=PA2#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Practical Laws and Data on the Condensation of Steam in Covered and Bare Pipes: To which is Added a Translation of Péclet's "Theory and Experiments on the Transmission of Heat Through Insulating Materials."|last=Paulding|first=Charles Pearson|last2=Péclet|first2=Eugène|date=1904|publisher=D. Van Nostrand Company|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Peclet experimented with a wide variety of metals ranging from tin to cast iron, and came to the conclusion that neither the color nor the visual reflectance were significant determining factors in the materials’ performance. Peclet calculated the reduction in BTUs for high and low emissive surfaces facing into various air spaces, discovering the benefits of a radiant barrier in reducing the transfer of heat.

In 1925, two German businessmen Schmidt and Dykerhoff filed for patents on reflective surfaces for use as building insulation because recent improvements in technology allowed low emissivity aluminum foil to be commercially viable. This became the launching pad for radiant barrier and reflective insulation around the world, and within the next 15 years, millions of square feet of radiant barrier were installed in the US alone.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
Within 30 years, radiant barrier was making a name for itself, and was included in projects at MIT, Princeton, and Frank Sinatra’s residence in Palm Springs, California.

==Applications==
===Space exploration===
For the [[Apollo program]], NASA helped develop a thin aluminum foil that reflected 95% of the radiant heat.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.sti.nasa.gov/tto/Spinoff2006/ch_9.html|title=Technology Transfer|last=Hall|first=Loura|date=2016-09-15|work=NASA|access-date=2018-04-13|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; A metalized film was used to protect spacecraft, equipment, and astronauts from thermal radiation or to retain heat in the extreme temperature fluctuations of space.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The aluminum was vacuum-coated to a thin film and applied to the base of the Apollo landing vehicles. It was also used in numerous other NASA projects like the [[James Webb Space Telescope]] and [[Skylab]]. In the vacuum of [[outer space]], where temperatures can range from {{convert|-400|to|250|F|-1}}&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.sti.nasa.gov/tto/Spinoff2004/ch_6.html|title=Technology Transfer|last=Hall|first=Loura|date=2016-09-15|work=NASA|access-date=2018-04-13|language=en|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050106195834/http://www.sti.nasa.gov/tto/Spinoff2004/ch_6.html |archivedate=6 January 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; heat transfer is only by radiation, so a radiant barrier is much more effective than it is on earth, where 5% to 45% of the heat transfer can still occur via convection and conduction, even when an effective radiant barrier is deployed. Radiant barrier&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; is a [[Space Foundation]] Certified Space Technology(TM). Radiant barrier was inducted into the [[Space Technology Hall of Fame]] in 1996.

===Textiles===
Since the 1970s,&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; sheets of metalized polyester called [[space blanket]]s have been commercially available as a means to prevent hypothermia and other cold weather injuries. Because of their durability and light weight, these blankets are popular for survival and first aid applications. Swarms of people can be seen draped in reflective metalized film after a marathon, especially where the temperatures are particularly cold, like during the annual [[New York City Marathon]] which takes place in the fall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/02/sports/lightweight-blankets-with-a-big-footprint-at-the-marathon.html?_r=0|newspaper=New York Times|date=1 November 2015|last=Cacciola|first=Scott|title=Lightweight Blankets With a Big Footprint at the Marathon|publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]|accessdate=13 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Window treatments===
Windows glass can be coated to achieve [[low emissivity]] or “low-e”. Some windows use laminate polyester film where at least one layer has been metalized using a process called [[sputtering]]. Sputtering occurs when a metal, most often aluminum, is vaporized and the polyester film is passed through it. This process can be adjusted to control the amount of metal that ultimately coats the surface of the film.

These metalized films are applied to one or more surfaces of the glass to resist the transfer of radiant heat, yet the films are so thin that they allow visible light to pass through. Since the thin coatings are fragile and can be damaged when exposed to air and moisture, manufacturers typically use multiple pane windows. While films are typically applied to the glass during manufacturing, some films may be available for homeowners to apply themselves. Homeowner-applied window films are typically expected to last 10–15 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.energysavers.gov/your_home/windows_doors_skylights/index.cfm/mytopic=13430|title=Energy Saver {{!}} Department of Energy|website=www.energysavers.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Construction==
===Roofs and attics===
When radiant solar energy strikes a roof, heating the roofing material (shingles, tiles or roofing sheets) and roof sheathing by conduction, it causes the underside of the roof surface and the roof framing to radiate heat downward through the roof space (attic / ceiling cavity) toward the attic floor / upper ceiling surface. When a radiant barrier is placed between the roofing material and the insulation on the attic floor, much of the heat radiated from the hot roof is reflected back toward the roof and the low emissivity of the underside of the radiant barrier means that very little radiant heat is emitted downwards. This makes the top surface of the insulation cooler than it would have been without a radiant barrier and thus reduces the amount of heat that moves through the insulation into the rooms below.

This is different from the cool roof strategy which reflects solar energy before it heats the roof, but both are means of reducing radiant heat. According to a study by Florida Solar Energy Center,&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fsec.ucf.edu/en/publications/html/fsec-pf-337-98/|title=FSEC-PF-336-98|website=www.fsec.ucf.edu|access-date=2018-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; a white tile or white metal cool roof can outperform traditional black shingle roof with a radiant barrier in the attic, but the black shingle roof with radiant barrier outperformed the red tile cool roof.

For installing a radiant barrier under a metal or tile roof, the radiant barrier may be applied directly over the roof sheathing. Then [[furring strip]]s (1x4s) are applied over the radiant barrier before the metal or tile roof is applied. The furring strips ensure that the radiant barrier faces into a sufficient air space. If an air space is not present or is too small, heat may be able to conduct through the radiant barrier. Since the metal in the radiant barrier is highly conductive, the heat transfer would be by conduction and the heat would not be blocked. According to the US Department of Energy, “Reflective insulation and radiant barrier products must have an air space adjacent to the reflective material to be effective.”&lt;ref name="US Dept of Energy: Challenging the Code Status"&gt;[http://www.energycodes.gov/publications/STS/2009/standard_january09.pdf] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120525185815/http://www.energycodes.gov/publications/STS/2009/standard_january09.pdf |date=2012-05-25 }}, Challenging the Code Status.&lt;/ref&gt;

The most common application for a radiant barrier is as a facing for attics. For a traditional shingle/tile/iron roof, radiant barriers may be applied over the rafters or trusses and under the roof decking. This application method has the radiant barrier sheets draped over the trusses of rafters, creating a small air space above with the radiant barrier facing into the entire interior attic space below.&lt;ref name="RIMA International Handbook"&gt;[http://www.rimainternational.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/handbook.pdf], RIMA International Handbook.&lt;/ref&gt; Reflective [[aluminium foil|foil]] laminate (or [[sarking]]) is a product commonly used as the radiant barrier sheet.

Another method of applying radiant barrier to the roof in new construction is to use a radiant barrier that is pre-laminated to [[Oriented strand board|OSB panels]] or roof sheathing. Manufacturers of this installation method often tout the savings in labor costs in using a product that serves as roof decking and radiant barrier in one.

To apply radiant barrier in an existing attic, a radiant barrier may be stapled to the underside of the roof rafters. This method offers the same benefits as the draped method in that dual air spaces are provided. However, it is essential that the vents be allowed to remain open to prevent moisture from being trapped in the attic. In general, it is preferred to have the radiant barrier applied to the underside of the roof with an air space facing down to prevent the accumulation of dust, preventing the radiant barrier from conducting.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.energysavers.gov/your_home/insulation_airsealing/index.cfm/mytopic=11680|title=Energy Saver {{!}} Department of Energy|website=www.energysavers.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The final method of installing a radiant barrier in an attic is to lay it over the top of the insulation on the attic floor. While this method can be more effective in the winter&lt;ref name="TVA"&gt;[http://txspace.di.tamu.edu/bitstream/handle/1969.1/6869/ESL-HH-86-11-10.pdf?sequence=3]{{dead link|date=January 2018|bot=InternetArchiveBot|fix-attempted=yes}}, Tennessee Valley Authority Test.&lt;/ref&gt; there are a few potential concerns with this application, which the US Department of Energy&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  and the Reflective Insulation Manufacturers Association International&lt;ref name="RIMA International Handbook" /&gt; feel the need to address. First, a breathable radiant barrier should always be used here.  This is usually achieved by small perforations in the radiant barrier foil.  The vapor transmission rate of the radiant barrier should be at least 5 perms, as measured with [http://www.astm.org/Standards/E96.htm ASTM E96], and the moisture in the insulation should be checked before installation. Second, the product should meet the required flame spread, which includes [http://www.astm.org/Standards/E84.htm ASTM E84] with the [http://www.astm.org/Standards/E2599.htm ASTM E2599] method. Lastly, this method allows for dust to accumulate over the top surface of the radiant barrier, potentially reducing the efficiency over time.

====Energy savings====
According to a 2010 study by the Building Envelope Research Program of the Oak Ridge National Laboratory,&lt;ref name="Oak Ridge National Laboratory"&gt;[http://www.ornl.gov/sci/ees/etsd/btric/RadiantBarrier/index.shtml] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120106042411/http://www.ornl.gov/sci/ees/etsd/btric/RadiantBarrier/index.shtml |date=2012-01-06 }}, ORNL Radiant Barrier Fact Sheet, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; homes with air-conditioning duct work in the attic in the hottest climate zones, such as in the US [[Deep South]], could benefit the most from radiant barrier interventions, with annual utility bill savings up to $150, whereas homes in milder climates, e.g., Baltimore, could see savings about half those of their southern neighbors. On the other hand, if there are no ducts or air handlers in the attic, the annual savings could be even much less, from about $12 in Miami to $5 in Baltimore.  Nevertheless, a radiant barrier may still help to improve comfort and to reduce the peak air-conditioning load.

====Shingle temperature====
One common misconception regarding radiant barrier is that the heat reflecting off the radiant barrier back to the roof has the potential to increase the roof temperature and possibly damage the shingles. Performance testing by Florida Solar Energy Center&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; demonstrated that the increase in temperature at the hottest part of the day was no more than about 5 degrees F. In fact, this study showed that radiant barrier had the potential to decrease the roof temperature once the sun went down because it prevented heat loss through the roof. RIMA International wrote a technical paper on the subject which included statements  collected from large roofing manufacturers, and none said that radiant barrier would in any way affect the warranty of the shingles.&lt;ref name="RIMA International Technical Bulletin 103"&gt;[http://www.rimainternational.org/index.php/technical/tb-index/tb103/] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111121075809/http://www.rimainternational.org/index.php/technical/tb-index/tb103/ |date=2011-11-21 }} RIMA International: Shingle Study Bulletin.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Attic dust accumulation====
When laying a radiant barrier over the insulation on the attic floor, it is possible for dust to accumulate on the top side. Many factors like dust particle size, dust composition and the amount of ventilation in the attic affect how dust accumulates and thus the ultimate performance of radiant barrier in the attic. A study by the Tennessee Valley Authority&lt;ref name="TVA" /&gt; mechanically applied a small amount of dust over a radiant barrier and found no significant effect when testing for performance. However, TVA referenced a previous study which stated that it was possible for the radiant barrier to collect so much dust that its reflectivity could be decreased by nearly half.
It is not true that a double-sided radiant barrier on the attic floor is immune to the dust concern. The TVA study&lt;ref name="TVA" /&gt; also tested a double-sided radiant barrier with black plastic draped on top to simulate heavy dust accumulation, as well as a single-sided radiant barrier with heavy kraft paper on the top. The test indicated that the radiant barrier was not performing, and the small air spaces created between the peaks of the insulation were not sufficient to block radiant heat.

===Walls===
Radiant barrier may be used as a vented skin around the exterior of a wall.&lt;ref name="RIMA International Handbook" /&gt; Furring strips are applied to the sheathing to create a vented air space between the radiant barrier and the siding, and vents are used at the top and bottom to allow convective heat to rise naturally to the attic. If brick is being used on the exterior, then a vented air space may already be present, and furring strips are not necessary. Wrapping a house with radiant barrier can result in a 10% to 20% reduction in the tonnage air conditioning system requirement, and save both energy and construction costs.

===Floors===
Reflective foil, bubble foil insulations, and radiant barriers are noted for their ability to reflect unwanted solar radiation in hot climates, when applied properly. Reflective foils are fabricated from aluminum foils with a variety of backings such as roofing paper, craft paper, plastic film, polyethylene bubbles, or cardboard. Reflective bubble foil is basically a plastic bubble wrap sheet with a reflective foil layer and belongs to a class of insulation products known as radiant foils. Reflective bubble/foil insulations are primarily radiant barriers, and reflective insulation systems work by reducing radiant heat gain. To be effective, the reflective surface must face an air space, also dust accumulation on the reflective surface will reduce its reflective capability. The radiant barrier should be installed in a manner to minimize dust accumulation on the reflective surface.

Radiant barriers are more effective in hot climates than in cooler/cold climates (especially when cooling air ducts are located in the attic). When the sun heats a roof, it's primarily the sun's radiant energy that makes the roof hot. Much of this heat travels by conduction through the roofing materials to the attic side of the roof. The hot roof material then radiates its gained heat energy onto the cooler attic surfaces, including the air ducts and the attic floor. A radiant barrier reduces the radiant heat transfer from the underside of the roof to the other surfaces in the attic. Some studies show that radiant barriers can reduce cooling costs 5% to 10% when used in a warm, sunny climate. The reduced heat gain may even allow for a smaller air conditioning system. In cool climates, however, it's usually more cost-effective to install more thermal insulation than to add a radiant barrier.&lt;ref name = "Research Highlight, Technical Series 04-127: Comparison of Under-Floor Insulation Systems"&gt;https://www.cmhc-schl.gc.ca/odpub/pdf/63728.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Both the American Department of Energy (DOE, Energy Efficiency &amp; Renewable Energy Department)&lt;ref&gt;http://apps1.eere.energy.gov/buildings/publications/pdfs/building_america/38309.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; and the Ministry of Natural Resources (NRCAN)&lt;ref name="nrcan.gc.ca"&gt;http://www.nrcan.gc.ca/sites/www.nrcan.gc.ca/files/energy/pdf/housing/Keeping%20the%20Heat%20In_e.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; state that these systems are not recommended for cold or very cold climates.

===Canada===
Canada is considered to be a cold climate, so these products do not perform as promoted. Though they are often marketed as offering very high insulating values, there is no specific standard for radiant insulation products, so be wary of posted testimonials and manufacturers’ thermal performance claims. Research has shown that the insulation value of reflective bubble foil insulations and radiant barriers can vary from RSI 0 (R-0) to RSI 0.62 (R-3.5) per thickness of material. A study conducted by CMHC (Canada Mortgage &amp; Housing Corporation) on four homes in Paris, ON found there that the performance of the bubble foil was similar to an uninsulated floor. It also performed a cost-benefit analysis and the cost-benefit ratio was $12 to $13 per cubic metre RSI.&lt;ref name="nrcan.gc.ca"/&gt;

The effective insulating value depends on the number of adjacent dead air spaces, layers of foil and where they are installed. If the foil is laminated to rigid foam insulation, the total insulating value is obtained by adding the RSI of the foam insulation to the RSI of the dead air space and the foil. If there is no air space or clear bubble layer, the RSI value of the film is zero.

[[File:Radiant slab.png|thumb|380px|Room section with a thermally-active radiant slab cooling the space]]

A '''radiant heating and cooling system''' refers to temperature-controlled surfaces that exchange heat with their surrounding environment through [[convection]] and [[Thermal radiation |radiation]]. By definition, in radiant heating and cooling systems, thermal radiation covers more than 50% of heat exchange within the space.&lt;ref name="Chapter6 Ashrae"&gt;{{Citation
| title = ASHRAE Handbook. HVAC Systems and Equipment. Chapter 6. Panel Heating and Cooling
| year = 2012
| publisher = American Society of Heating and Cooling}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[Hydronic]] radiant heating and cooling systems are water-based. It refers to panels or embedded building components (floors, ceilings or walls). Other types include air-based and electrical systems (which use electrical resistance for heating purpose mainly). Important portions of building surfaces are usually required for the radiant exchange.

==Applications==
Radiant heating and cooling systems can be used in commercial, residential, education, and recreational buildings, museums, hospitals, and other type of buildings. The application depends on the type of radiant system (see below types of radiant systems), on climate conditions and on ventilation system used.

==System description==

===Radiative heat exchange===
Heat radiation is the energy in the form of [[electromagnetic]] waves emitted by a solid, liquid, or gas as a result of its temperature.&lt;ref name="Oxford reference"&gt;{{Citation
| title = Oxford Reference
| publisher = Oxford University
| url = http://www.oxfordreference.com/}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In buildings, the radiant heat flow between two internal surfaces (or a surface and a person) is influenced by the [[emissivity]] of the heat emitting surface and by the [[view factor]] between this surface and the receptive surface (object or person) in the room.&lt;ref name="Babiak 2007"&gt;{{Citation
| title = PhD Thesis, Low Temperature Heating and High Temperature Cooling. Thermally activated building system
| year = 2007
| author = Babiak, Jan
| publisher = Department of Building Services, Technical University of Denmark}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The heat transfer by radiation is proportional to the power of four of the absolute surface temperature.

The [[emissivity]] of a material (usually written ε or e) is the relative ability of its surface to emit energy by radiation. A black body has an emissivity of 1 and a perfect reflector has an emissivity of 0.&lt;ref name="Oxford reference"/&gt;

In radiative heat transfer, a [[view factor]] quantifies the relative importance of the radiation that leaves an object (person or surface) and strikes another one, considering the other surrounding objects. In enclosures, radiation leaving a surface is conserved, therefore, the sum of all view factors associated with a given object is equal to 1.
In the case of a room, the view factor of a radiant surface and a person depend on their relative positions. As a person is often changing position and as a room might be occupied by many persons at the same time, diagrams for omnidirectional person can be used.&lt;ref name="ISO EN 7726"&gt;{{Citation
| title = ISO, EN. 7726. Ergonomics of the thermal environments-Instruments for measuring physical quantities
| year = 1998
| publisher = ISO, Geneva, International Organisation for Standardisation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== '''Thermal response time''' ===
Response time (τ95), aka [[time constant]], is used to analyze the dynamic thermal performance of radiant systems. The response time for a radiant system is defined as the time it takes for the surface temperature of a radiant system to reach 95% of the difference between its final and initial values when a step change in control of the system is applied as input.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ning|first=Baisong|last2=Schiavon|first2=Stefano|last3=Bauman|first3=Fred S.|date=2017|title=A novel classification scheme for design and control of radiant system based on thermal response time|url=https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0378778816317583|journal=Energy and Buildings|volume=137|pages=38–45|doi=10.1016/j.enbuild.2016.12.013|issn=0378-7788|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is mainly influenced by concrete thickness, pipe spacing, and to a less degree, concrete type. It is not affected by pipe diameter, room operative temperature, supply water temperature, and water flow regime. By using response time, radiant systems can be classified into fast response (τ95&lt; 10 min, like RCP), medium response (1 h&lt;τ95&lt;9 h, like Type A, B, D, G) and slow response (9 h&lt; τ95&lt;19 h, like Type E and Type F).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Additionally, floor and ceiling radiant systems have different response times due to different heat transfer coefficients with room thermal environment, and the pipe-embedded position.

===Operative temperature and thermal comfort===
The [[operative temperature]] is an indicator of [[thermal comfort]] which takes into account the effects of both convection and radiation. Operative temperature is defined as a uniform temperature of a radiantly black enclosure in which an occupant would exchange the same amount of heat by radiation plus convection as in the actual nonuniform environment.

With radiant systems, thermal comfort is achieved at warmer interior temp than all-air systems for cooling scenario, and at lower temperature than all-air systems for heating scenario.&lt;ref name="ISO 11855-1"&gt;{{Citation
| title = ISO 11855-1. Building Environment Design - Design, Construction and Operation of Radiant Heating and Cooling Systems - Part 1
| year = 2012
| publisher = ISO}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Thus, radiant systems can helps to achieve energy savings in building operation while maintaining the wished comfort level.

=== '''Thermal comfort in radiant vs. all-air buildings''' ===
Based on a large study performed using [[Center for the Built Environment]]'s [[Green building#Indoor environmental quality enhancement|Indoor environmental quality (IEQ]]) occupant survey to compare occupant satisfaction in radiant and all-air conditioned buildings, both systems create equal indoor environmental conditions, including acoustic satisfaction, with a tendency towards improved temperature satisfaction in radiant buildings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Karmann|first=Caroline|last2=Schiavon|first2=Stefano|last3=Graham|first3=Lindsay T.|last4=Raftery|first4=Paul|last5=Bauman|first5=Fred|date=December 2017|title=Comparing temperature and acoustic satisfaction in 60 radiant and all-air buildings|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.buildenv.2017.10.024|journal=Building and Environment|volume=126|pages=431–441|doi=10.1016/j.buildenv.2017.10.024|issn=0360-1323|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Radiant temperature asymmetry===
The radiant temperature asymmetry is defined as the difference between the plane radiant temperature of the two opposite sides of a small plane element. As regards occupants within a building, [[thermal radiation]] field around the body may be non-uniform due to hot and cold surfaces and direct sunlight, bringing therefore local discomfort. The norm ISO 7730 and the ASHRAE 55 standard give the predicted percentage of dissatisfied occupants (PPD) as a function of the radiant temperature asymmetry and specify the acceptable limits. In general, people are more sensitive to asymmetric radiation caused by a warm ceiling than that caused by hot and cold vertical surfaces. The detailed calculation method of percentage dissatisfied due to a radiant temperature asymmetry is described in ISO 7730.

===Design considerations===
While specific design requirements will depend on the type of radiant system, a few issues are common to most radiant systems.

* For cooling application, radiant systems can lead [[condensation]] issues. Local climate needs to be evaluated and taken into account in the design. Air dehumidification can be necessary for humid climate. 
* Many types of radiant systems incorporate massive building elements. The [[thermal mass]] involved will have a consequence on the thermal response of the system. The operation schedule of a space and the control strategy of the radiant system play a key role in the proper functioning of the system.  
* Many types of radiant systems incorporate hard surfaces which influence indoor acoustics. Additional acoustic solutions may need to be considered.
*A design strategy to reduce acoustical impacts of radiant systems is using free-hanging acoustical clouds. Cooling experiments on free-hanging acoustical clouds for an office room showed that for 47% cloud coverage of the ceiling area, 11% reduction in cooling capacity was caused by the cloud coverage. Good acoustic quality can be achieved with only minor reduction of cooling capacity.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Karmann|first=Caroline|last2=Bauman|first2=Fred S.|last3=Raftery|first3=Paul|last4=Schiavon|first4=Stefano|last5=Frantz|first5=William H.|last6=Roy|first6=Kenneth P.|date=March 2017|title=Cooling capacity and acoustic performance of radiant slab systems with free-hanging acoustical clouds|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.enbuild.2017.01.002|journal=Energy and Buildings|volume=138|pages=676–686|doi=10.1016/j.enbuild.2017.01.002|issn=0378-7788|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Combining acoustical clouds and ceiling fans can offset the modest reduction in cooling capacity from a radiant cooled ceiling caused by the presence of the clouds, and results in increase in cooling capacity.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Karmann|first=Caroline|last2=Bauman|first2=Fred|last3=Raftery|first3=Paul|last4=Schiavon|first4=Stefano|last5=Koupriyanov|first5=Mike|date=January 2018|title=Effect of acoustical clouds coverage and air movement on radiant chilled ceiling cooling capacity|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.enbuild.2017.10.046|journal=Energy and Buildings|volume=158|pages=939–949|doi=10.1016/j.enbuild.2017.10.046|issn=0378-7788|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hydronic radiant systems==
Depending on the position of the pipes in the building construction, hydronic radiant systems can be sorted into 4 main categories:
* '''Embedded Surface Systems''': pipes embedded within the surface layer (not within the structure) 
* '''Thermally Active Building Systems (TABS)''': the pipes thermally coupled and embedded in the building structure (slabs, walls)&lt;ref name="REHVA Guidebook 07"&gt;{{Citation

| publisher = REHVA
| last1 = Babiak | first1 = Jan
| last2 = Olesen | first2 = Bjarne W.
| last3 = Petras | first3 = Dusan}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Capillary Surface Systems''': pipes embedded in a layer at the inner ceiling/wall surface
* '''Radiant Panels''': metal pipes integrated into panels (not within the structure); heat carrier close to the surface

===Types (ISO 11855)===
The norm ISO 11855-2&lt;ref name="ISO 11855-2"&gt;{{Citation
| title = ISO 11855-2. Building Environment Design - Design, Construction and Operation of Radiant Heating and Cooling Systems - Part 2
| year = 2012
| publisher = ISO}}&lt;/ref&gt;
focuses on embedded water based surface heating and cooling systems and TABS. Depending on construction details, this norm distinguishes 7 different types of those systems (Types A to G)

* '''Type A''' with pipes embedded in the screed or concrete (“wet” system)
* '''Type B''' with pipes embedded outside the screed (in the thermal insulation layer, “dry” system)
* '''Type C''' with pipes embedded in the leveling layer, above which the second screed layer is placed
* '''Type D''' include plane section systems (extruded plastic / group of capillary grids)
* '''Type E''' with pipes embedded in a massive concrete layer
* '''Type F''' with capillary pipes embedded in a layer at the inner ceiling or as a separate layer in gypsum
* '''Type G''' with pipes embedded in a wooden floor construction

===Energy sources===
Radiant systems are associated with low-exergy systems. Low-exergy refers to the possibility to utilize ‘low quality energy’ (i.e. dispersed energy that has little ability to do useful work). Both heating and cooling can in principle be obtained at temperature levels that are close to the ambient environment. The low temperature difference requires that the heat transmission takes place over relative big surfaces as for example applied in ceilings or underfloor heating systems.&lt;ref name="REHVA Feb 2012"&gt;{{Citation
| title = Building Integrated System Design for Sustainable Heating and Cooling
| url = http://www.rehva.eu/fileadmin/hvac-dictio/01-2012/02-2012/building-integrated-system-design-for-sustainable-heating-and-cooling.pdf
| year = 2012
| author = Nielsen, Lars
| journal = REHVA journal
| pages = 24–27}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Radiant systems using low temperature heating and high temperature cooling are typical example of low-exergy systems. 
Energy sources such as geothermal (direct cooling / geothermal heat pump heating) and solar hot water are compatible with radiant systems. These sources can lead to important savings in terms of primary energy use for buildings.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19010">Using of '''spiral ground heat exchangers in heat pump applications''' plays a very important role in supplying heating/cooling demands of the buildings cheaply and sustainable. These-days [[environmental pollution]] is one of the main concerns among governments and energy consumption of the buildings has a significant portion in it. One of the efficient ways in supplying heating and cooling demands of the buildings is using potential energy stored in ground which is clean and sustainable. These types of systems are called [[ground source heat pump]] (GSHP) systems which are used supplying space heating and cooling demands. The initial cost and efficiency of GSHP systems can be influenced by optimal design of [[ground heat exchanger]]s (GHEs).

One of the most important GHEs that is used these days is ''spiral GHEs''. These types of GHEs are ''cheaper'' than others and also have some advantages. 
Many parameters influencing thermal performance of spiral GHEs such as external major diameter of borehole, spacing, distance between each turns of spiral GHEs, etc.When we have a large application area, one spiral GHE is not enough for supplying heating or cooling demands of the building. In this case more than one GHE is needed to be embedded into the ground. When we have more than one GHE in ground, optimization of distance between them become as an essential problem. Another important parameters which are highly affecting [[Thermal efficiency|thermal performance]] of a GSHP system are thermal properties of ground. Before integrating a GSHP system to the building thermal properties of ground or soil should be determined.

== Introduction ==
[[Air contamination]] is one of the significant [[environmental concern]]s in the world. Reaching solutions to environmental problems that we face today needs long term activities for sustainable development. Renewable energy sources seem to be one of the best and effective solutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Wood, C.J., Liu, H., Riffat |title=An investigation of the heat pump performance and ground temperature of a pile foundation heat exchanger system for a residential building |journal=Energy |date=2010 |volume=35 |pages=32–40}}&lt;/ref&gt; In recent decades, energy consumption for building has increased and many efforts are being done to investigate alternative energy sources for supplying heating and cooling demands of building. One of the best alternate ways is the use of ground energy, which is clean, green and sustainable. This energy can be utilized through GSHP system, which is well established in most of the European countries for space heating applications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bakirci, K. |title=Evaluation of the performance of a ground-source heatpumpsystem with series GHE (ground heat exchanger) in the cold climate region |journal=Energy |date=2010 |volume=35 |pages=3088–3096}}&lt;/ref&gt; GSHP systems contain two main parts, GHEs and [[heat pump]].

In these systems, heat source is soil which stored huge amount of energy inside. When fluid/water stars flowing inside pipelines heat is transferred from fluid to the soil or from soil to the fluid due to the temperature difference between them. Many researches show indicate that, temperature of ground is constant specially after 6 meter depth. This means that, temperature in ground surface is not affecting temperature of soil after 6 meter depth.&lt;ref name=Banks&gt;{{cite book |last1=Banks |first1=David |title=An introduction to thermogeology: ground source heating and cooling |date=2008 |publisher=Blackwell Publishing}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As an example, assume that fluid is pumped into the ground at 40 degree Celsius and undisturbed ground temperature is 18 degree Celsius. As the time passes temperature of soil around spiral GHEs will be increased and then we will have less heat transfer between pumped fluid and soil due to the low temperature difference. In the case of deep GHEs, temperature of exhausted fluid is too high. In this case these types of GHEs can be used directly for supplying heating demands of the building.&lt;ref name=Banks /&gt;

=== Heat pump ===
As it was stated, heat is transferred from high to [[Low-temperature|low temperature medium]] without needing any external devices.But in many cases heated is needed to be transferred reversely. Heat pumps are devices which receive heat from low temperature and deliver it to a higher temperature reservoir. Working procedure of refrigerators and heat pumps are same and only the purposes of their using are different.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Çengel, Y., Boles, M.A. |title=Thermodynamics: An engineering approach |date=2011 |publisher=McGraw-Hill |location=New York |edition= 7th }}&lt;/ref&gt;
A heat pump can also extract heat from a heat source and reject heat to air and water at the higher temperature for heating. One of the important parameters for heat pumps is [[coefficient of performance]] (COP) of it. Definition of COP is desired output per desired input of the device.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Ingley, H. A., Wang, S. K., Rabl, A. |title=Air Conditioning and Refrigeration |date=2005 |publisher=CRC Press |location=Atlanta, US |edition= 2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ground Source Heat Pump Systems ===
Ground source heat pumps (GSHP) or geothermal heat pumps are heating/cooling devices which use ground as their heat source. GSHPs offer significant reductions of electrical energy use, cheap levels of maintenance requirements, and are [[environment friendly]]. A ground source heat pump is a heating and cooling system that transfers heat to or from the ground, using the ground as a heat sink in the summer and heat source in the winter. A ground source heat pump can be significantly more energy efficient than conventional air source heat pump.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ascione, F., Bellia, L., Minichiello, F. |title=Earth-to-air heat exchangers for Italian climates |journal=Renewable Energy |date=2011 |volume=36 |pages=2177–2188}}&lt;/ref&gt; As it was discussed, GSHP systems consist of two main parts, heat pump and ground heat exchangers.

=== Ground heat exchanger ===
Ground heat exchangers use underground soil as a heat source. When water/fluid flows through pipes, heat is transferred from the water to the soil or from soil to the fluid depending on the temperature of fluid and its surrounding temperature. GHEs have some classifications such as deep, shallow, open loop, closed loop etc.&lt;ref name=Banks /&gt; Choosing correct types of GHEs is highly depending on geological properties of application area. For instance underground fluid flow or having a lake near application area could be very important advantages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Florides, G., Kalogrirou, S. |title=Ground heat exchanger-A review of system model and applications |journal=Renewable Energy |date=2007 |volume=32 |pages=2461–2478}}&lt;/ref&gt; Heat is transferred in the ground by two ways, convection and conduction.&lt;ref name=Banks /&gt;
[[File:Spiral GHE.jpg|thumb|Fig.1 Spiral GHE]]
As it was discussed several types of GHEs such as shallow and deep ones are existed. Deep GHEs are generally U-tube GHEs with common ranges of 50-200 meter. Shallow GHEs are divided to spiral, slinky, pond/lake and snails types. Among different types of shallow GHEs spiral ones show the best performance in the same application unit area which means that more amount of heat can be extracted or injected into the ground. This also means that more space area of the building could be heated or cooled by spiral GHEs. Spiral GHEs are favorable due to their high efficiencies and low initial costs. When spiral GHEs are connected to the heat pump system and total system (GSHP) is integrated to the buildings, heating/cooling demands of that specific residential building could be supplied easily by spiral GHEs. Many researches show that when nine numbers of spiral GHEs are connected to the heat pump system, heating demands of at least 200 square meter space area of a building could be supplied. Based on different parameters of spiral GHEs this value could be changed between 200-800 square meter space area. In Fig. 1 schematic view of series of spiral GHEs are shown.&lt;ref name=Banks /&gt;

Heat transfer rate of GHEs is depending on several parameters such as thermal conductivity of soil or application area, thermal properties of fluid, peripheral area of GHEs and flow rate of fluid inside GHEs. When we have spiral GHEs it means that we have more peripheral area of heat exchanger and so we have more heat transfer. Or for pond/lake types GHEs, since we have fluid around heat exchangers this means that we will have more heat transfer and more temperature difference between inlet and outlet fluid. This issue is one the most important advantages of pond/lake GHEs.&lt;ref name=Banks /&gt;

== Integration of spiral GHEs to the building ==
[[File:Integration of GSHP system and building.jpg|thumb|Fig.2:Integration of GSHP system and building]]
Fig. 2 shows integration of a GSHP system to the building. As it is shown in this figure, heat is extracted from ground by spiral GHEs. After extraction process, fluid enters a controller to control inlet and out fluid temperature of the machine. After that fluid will enter heat pump system and supply required heating/cooling demands of the building. To calculate effective amount of space area that can be heated or cooled by GSHP system different parameters are needed. These parameters are amount of extracted/injected heat from/to ground by spiral GHEs, [[Heat pump and refrigeration cycle|coefficient of performance (COP) of heat pump]], [[Heating load|heating]] and [[cooling load]]s of the building&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Dehghan B. |first1=Babak |title=Effectiveness of using spiral ground heat exchangers in ground source heat pump system of a building for district heating/cooling purposes: Comparison among different configurations |journal=Applied Thermal Engineering |date=2018 |volume=130 |pages=1489–1506 |doi=10.1016/j.applthermaleng.2017.11.124 |url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.applthermaleng.2017.11.124}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Different researches show that distance between spiral GHEs are highly affecting performance of GSHP system. It means that distance between them should be optimized well. By choosing low distance between them (less that 5 meter) there will be high performance loss in system and suitable amount of heat cannot be delivered or rejected from building.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Dehghan |first1=Babak |title=Parametric investigation of helical ground heat exchangers for heat pump applications |journal=Energy and Buildings |date=2016 |volume=127 |pages=999–1007 |url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.enbuild.2016.06.064}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Optimization of distance between spiral GHEs ===
As it is known, concept of extracting/injecting heat from/to ground is temperature different between two mediums. When there are more than one spiral GHEs embedded in ground it means that we have more thermal interactions in ground. When distance between heat exchangers is low (lower than 5 meter) thermal interactions between them is also too high. By increasing distance between them thermal interactions will be reduced and therefore we have low performance loss in system. Different researches show that at least 6/7 meter distance must be chosen between GHEs. For example, when number of spiral GHEs is nine we have 15%, 18%, 22% performance loss for 7, 6 and 5 meter distance between them respectively.&lt;ref name=Babak /&gt;

In ground source heat pump applications, optimization of distance between GHEs plays an important role in total performance of the system. This value also should be chosen based the availability of application area and also investors needs.
In Fig. 3 thermal interactions between nine mumbers of spiral GHEs are shown. As it is demonstrated as the time passes thermal interactions between spiral GHEs are increased.&lt;ref name=Babak&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Dehghan B. |first1=Babak |title=Experimental and computational investigation of the spiral ground heat exchangers for ground source heat pump applications |journal=Applied Thermal Engineering |date=2017 |volume=121 |pages=908–921 |url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.applthermaleng.2017.05.002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Thermal interaction.jpg|thumb|Fig.3: Thermal interaction]]

=== The effects of the Pitch Distance (Lp) and Major Diameter (D) of a Single Vertical spiral GHE on it’s Performance ===
The distance between each turns of the spiral and GHE major radius play a crucial role in the design process. These parameters are geometrical parameters which are influencing initial cost and thermal performance of GHEs. These properties are directly related to the vertical lengths required to construct the heat exchanger as well as amount of excavation.&lt;ref name=Babak /&gt; 
It is seen that by increasing the Lp and D, HTR value of a GHE is improved. On the other hand, the total cost of embedding the GHE into ground becomes higher and higher by increasing the values of Lp and D. Therefore, it is important for designers and investors that they know the exact requirements of consumers.&lt;ref name=Babak /&gt;

The improvement of HTR value with longer and bigger exchangers results in increment of installation costs, which are the main drawback of GSHPs. During the designing of GHE fields, maximum heat load of the consumer is considered, and the minimum required borehole sizes (Lp and D) are chosen. On the other hand, trying to minimize the installation cost by decreasing the sizes of Lp and D alone, causes higher number of GHE which also increases the initial cost. Therefore, initial cost should be minimized by considering the whole system. Furthermore, not only the initial cost but also the operational costs should be considered during the optimization of the system overall costs. This requires the long term predictions of HTR value of a GHE.Results show that the average HTR values linearly increase with the value of D and Lp. These linear dependencies are due to the increment of peripheral surface area and heat capacity of ground per turn.&lt;ref name=Babak /&gt;

=== A Typical Example for Vertical Spiral GHE Analysis ===
In this part, a building with 120 m2 heating/cooling area is considered. For heating and cooling of this building, GSHP system with vertical spiral GHE is chosen. As it is stated in different references, general required heat load for a standard building is approximately 80 W/m2. Therefore, total heat load of this building is 9600 W. Furthermore, COP value of a heat pump is assumed as 4.0. In this case, 7200 W heat is needed to pump from ground to building.
To predict the number of GHEs that are needed for heating and cooling applications, first of all long term performance of a single vertical spiral GHE should be estimated. Again by using COMSOL and based on previous validated data, HTR value of a single vertical spiral GHE is numerically predicted. The averaged HTR value is around 870 W for 1–6 months time interval.

In GHE designing procedure generally the most critical conditions are considered. The system is assumed to work 6 months non-stop in heating or cooling mode. For 6 month operation, COMSOL results show that averaged HTR of a single vertical  spiral GHE is 870 W. By taking all the above arguments into consideration it is concluded that 9 vertical spiral GHE is needed for this building. For more than 5 GHEs, we assume that five GHEs graph can be used for performance loss prediction with an acceptable error. By looking at figures in relevant literature{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}, ten meter distances between GHEs are chosen. For this distance, performance loss is less than 5%. Based on consumers utilization and designers goals this amount can of course be vary. The suggested configuration is shown in Fig. 4 for most critical conditions (6 months non-stop operation). In this configuration, performance loss is predicted less than 5%.&lt;ref name=Babak /&gt; 
[[File:Configuration of spiral GHEs.jpg|thumb|Fig.4: Configuration of spiral GHEs]]

Sometimes the application area is limited and there is no enough space for placing GHEs. In that case, more performance losses can be accepted to minimize the application area. For nine vertical spiral GHEs, the following configuration can also be used. In corners and sides we can use three GHEs performance loss graph. 
Figure 5 demonstrates other configuration of nine spiral GHEs that can be used.&lt;ref name=Babak /&gt; 
[[File:Circular configuration of spiral GHEs.jpg|thumb|Fig.5: Circular configuration of spiral GHEs]]

== Beneficial use of some environmental waste energy through spiral GHEs ==
Nowadays keeping our environment clean is one the most important issues. There are still many waste heat and energies which are wasted into the environment such as, [[waste heat]] of [[gas turbine]]s exhaust gasses or waste gasses in [[biomass]] systems. These waste heats can be used beneficially for supplying heating demands of the buildings. One way to use this energy usefully is to store it in ground and then re-extract it through spiral GHEs for providing heating demands of the buildings. Recent researches show that spiral GHEs could be one of the best choices. First waste heat could be stored in ground by spiral GHEs and then extracted by them. Ground has ability to store this energy in ground for a long period. Also results of different researches show that amount of space area that can be heated by GSHP system is multiplied by four.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Dehghan B. |first1=Babak |title=Performance assessment of ground source heat pump system integrated with micro gas turbine: Waste heat recovery |journal=Energy Conversion and Management |date=2017 |volume=152 |pages=328–341 |url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.enconman.2017.09.058}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== General discussion about spiral GHEs ==
This short article presents the analyses of various parameters on the efficiency of spiral GHE for GSHP systems. The most important parameters, which influence the performance of GSHPs, have been thoroughly analyzed, running long-term simulations and estimating the performance losses for each GHE configuration. 
The results prove that Lp and D are one of the important parameters in the design of a GSHP. Although increasing these parameters can improve the efficiency of GSHP, a larger investment is needed for installation. Therefore, an optimum length should be found, which minimizes the total cost over the plant lifetime for an acceptable performance value.&lt;ref name=Babak /&gt;

In the large number of GHE, one of the most essential parameters that affect the system performance is distance between GHEs. The performance losses are less than 5% if the distance between GHE is more than 5 m, 7 m and 9 m for 2, 3 and 5 GHEs configuration. Therefore, spiral GHEs could be one good choice for storing environmental waste energy in the ground and then re-utilize it.&lt;ref name=Babak /&gt;

The '''Subboreal''' is a [[paleoclimatology|climatic period]], immediately before the present one, of the [[Holocene]]. It lasted from 3710 to 450 [[Common Era|BCE]].

== Etymology ==
The composite scientific term ''Subboreal'', meaning "below the Boreal," is derived from the [[Latin]] ''sub'' (below, under) and the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''Βορέας'', from [[Boreas (god)|Boreas]], the god of the North Wind. The word was first introduced in 1889 by [[Rutger Sernander]]&lt;ref&gt;Sernander, R. (1889). Om växtlämningar i Skandinaviens marina bildningar. Bot. Not. 1889, p. 190-199, Lund.&lt;/ref&gt; to distinguish it from [[Axel Blytt]]'s [[Boreal (period)|Boreal]], which had been established in 1876.&lt;ref&gt;BIytt, A. (1876a). Immigration of the Norwegian Flora. Alb. Cammermeyer. Christiania (Oslo), p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Subboreal followed the [[Atlantic (period)|Atlantic]] and was followed by the [[Subatlantic]]. The Subboreal is equivalent to W. H. Zagwijn's [[pollen zone]]s IVa and IVb&lt;ref&gt;[[Waldo Heliodoor Zagwijn]] (1986). Nederland in het Holoceen. Geologie van Nederland, Deel 1, p. 46. Rijks Geologische Dienst Haarlem (editors). Staatsuitgeverij, 's-Gravenhage.&lt;/ref&gt; and T. Litt's pollen zone VIII.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Litt|first1=T.|last2=Brauer|first2=A.|last3=Goslar|first3=T.|last4=Merkt|first4=J.|last5=Bałaga|first5=K.|last6=Müller|first6=H.|last7=Ralska-Jasiewiczowa|first7=M.|last8=Stebich|first8=M.|last9=Negendank|first9=J. F. W.|title=Correlation and synchronisation of Lateglacial continental sequences in northern central Europe based on annually laminated lacustrine sediments|journal=Quaternary Science Reviews|date=2001|volume=20|issue=11|pages=1233–1249|doi=10.1016/S0277-3791(00)00149-9|bibcode=2001QSRv...20.1233L}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the pollen scheme of [[Fritz Theodor Overbeck]], it occupies pollen zone X.

In [[paleoclimatology]], it is divided into an '''Older Subboreal''' and a '''Younger Subboreal'''. Historically, the Subboreal is equivalent to most of the [[Neolithic]] and the entire [[Bronze Age]], which started 4200 to 3800 years ago.

== Dating ==
The Subboreal is usually defined as 3710 to 5660 years BP. The lower limit is flexible, as some authors prefer to use 4400 BCE, or 6350 BP&lt;ref&gt;Herking, C. M. (2004). Pollenanalytische Untersuchungen zur holozänen Vegetationsgeschichte entlang des östlichen unteren Odertals und südlichen unteren Wartatals in Nordwestpolen. Dissertation, Göttingen, Georg-August-Universität.&lt;/ref&gt; in northwestern [[Poland]], even 4830 BC, or 6780 BP,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tobolski|first1=K.|title=Paläoökologische Untersuchungen des Siedlungsgebietes im Lednica Landschaftspark (Nordwestpolen)|journal=Offa|date=1990|volume=47|pages=109–131|doi=10.1594/PANGAEA.739770}}&lt;/ref&gt; And others use 5000 calendar years, or 3050 BCE. The upper limit of the Subboreal and, therefore the beginning of the Subatlantic, is also flexible and can be attributed to 1170 to 830 BCE,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jahns|first1=S.|title=Late-glacial and Holocene woodland dynamics and land-use history of the Lower Oder valley, north-eastern Germany, based on two, AMS&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;C-dated, pollen profiles|journal=Vegetation History and Archaeobotany|date=2000|volume=9|issue=2|pages=111–123|doi=10.1007/BF01300061}}&lt;/ref&gt; but it is usually fixed at 450 BCE. In [[varve]] years, the Subboreal corrsponds to 5660 to 2750 years BP.&lt;ref name=Litt&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Litt|first1=T.|last2=Schölzel|first2=C.|last3=Kühl|first3=N.|last4=Brauer|first4=A.|title=Vegetation and climate history in the Westeifel Volcanic Field (Germany) during the past 11 000 years based on annually laminated lacustrine maar sediments|journal=Boreas|date=2009|volume=38|issue=4|pages=679–690|doi=10.1111/j.1502-3885.2009.00096.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The boundary between the older and the younger Subboreal is considered to be 1350 BCE.

== Climatic evolution ==
[[File:Holocene Temperature Variations.png|thumb|upright=1.4|Temperature variations during the Holocene]]

The climate was generally dryer and slightly cooler (by about 0.1&amp;nbsp;°C) than in the preceding Atlantic but still warmer than today. The temperatures were 0.7&amp;nbsp;°C higher than during the following Subatlantic.

In [[Germany]], a drastic climatic cooling can be observed around 5000 [[varve]] years BP in the [[maar]]s of the [[Eifel]]. In the preceding interval lasting from 8200 till 5000 varve years ([[Holocene Climatic Optimum]]), the July temperatures were on average still 1&amp;nbsp;°C higher. At the same time, the January temperatures were rising and the yearly [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] increased.&lt;ref name=Litt /&gt;

In [[Northern Africa]] and in the [[Near East]], the interval from 4700 to 4100 years BP had renewed and lasting dry conditions, as is indicated by lake level minima.

=== Carbon dioxide ===
Levels of [[carbon dioxide]] had reached beginning of the Subboreal its Holocene minimal value of 260 ppm.

== Vegetation history ==
[[File:Brussels Zonienwoud.jpg|thumb|Stand of beech trees in the Sonian Forest near Brussels, Belgium]]
In [[Scandinavia]], the Atlantic/Subboreal boundary shows a distinct vegetational change. Tat is less pronounced in [[Western Europe]], but its typical mixed [[oak]] forest shows quite a fast decline in [[elm]] and [[Tilia|linden]]. The decline in linden is not fully understood; it might be due to cooling or human interference. The decline in elm is most likely due to elm disease, caused by the [[ascomycete]] ''[[Ceratocystis ulmi]]'', but climatic changes and anthropogenic pressure on the forests certainly must be considered as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Peglar|first1=S. M.|last2=Birks|first2=H. J. B.|title=The mid-Holocene ''Ulmus'' fall at Diss Mere, South-East England – disease and human impact?|journal=Vegetation History and Archaeobotany|date=1993|volume=2|issue=2|pages=61–68|doi=10.1007/BF00202183}}&lt;/ref&gt; The decline in elm, with a recession from 20 to 4%, as observed in Eifel maar pollen, has been dated in Central and Northern Europe as 4000 years BC,&lt;ref&gt;Behre, K.-E. &amp; Kucan, D. (1994). Die Geschichte der Kulturlandschaft und des Ackerbaus in der Siedlungskammer Flögeln, Niedersachsen. Probleme der Küstenforschung im südlichen Nordseegebiet, 21, p. 1-227.&lt;/ref&gt; but it more likely was diachronous over the interval 4350 to 3780 BC.&lt;ref&gt;Kubitz, B. (2000). Die holozäne Vegetations- und Siedlungsgeschichte in der Westeifel am Beispiel eines hochauflösenden Pollendiagrammes aus dem Meerfelder Maar. Dissertationes Botanicae, 339, p. 106.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another important event was the immigration of [[Fagus sylvatica|European beech]] (''Fagus sylvatica'') and [[hornbeam]] (''Carpinus betulus'') from their retreats on the [[Balkan]] and south of the [[Apennines]]. This happened also diachronously: beech pollen are found for the first time in the interval 4340 to 3540 BC, hornbeam pollen somewhat later between 3400 and 2900 BC. With the start of the Younger Subboreal is the massive spreading of beech. The establishment of beech and hornbeam was accompanied by indicator plants for human settlements and agriculture like [[cereal]]s and plantain (''[[Plantago lanceolata]]''), and [[hazel]] was receding.

The relatively-dry climate during the subboreal furthered the spreading of heath plants ([[Ericaceae]]).

== Sea level ==
[[File:Post-Glacial Sea Level.png|thumb|upright=1.4|Post-glacial sea level rise]]
Like in the Atlantic, the global [[sea level]] kept on rising during the Subboreal but at a much slower rate. The increase amounted to about 1 m, which corresponds to a rate of 0.3 mm per year. At the end of the Subboreal, the sea level was about 1 m below the current value.

=== Evolution in Baltic ===
In the [[Baltic region|Baltic]] the [[Litorina Sea]] had already established itself before the onset of the Subboreal. During the Older Subboreal the [[Litorina transgression|second Litorina transgression]] raised the sea level to 1 m below the actual value. After an intermediate '''Post-litorine Regression''' the '''third Litorina transgression''' reached 60 cm below present and during the beginning Subatlantic, it reached today's value.

=== Evolution North Sea region ===
In the [[North Sea]] region, the [[Flandrian transgression]] of the Atlantic was followed by a slight regression or standstill at the beginning of the Subboreal.

The '''Wernerian Natural History Society''' (12 January 1808 – 16 April 1858), commonly abbreviated as the '''Wernerian Society''', was a [[learned society]] interested in the broad field of [[natural history]], and saw papers presented on various topics such as [[mineralogy]], plants, insects, and scholarly expeditions. The Society was an offshoot of the [[Royal Society of Edinburgh]], and from its beginnings it was a rather elite organization.

The Society was named after [[Abraham Gottlob Werner]], a German geologist who was a creator of [[Neptunism]], a theory of [[Superposition principle|superposition]] based on a receding primordial ocean that had deposited all the rocks in the crust.&lt;ref name="SSP"&gt;[http://www.scholarly-societies.org/history/1808wnhs.html Scholarly Societies Project] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120204044020/http://www.scholarly-societies.org/history/1808wnhs.html |date=2012-02-04 }}, Wernerian Natural History Society.&lt;/ref&gt; At this time all rocks, including [[basalt]], and crystalline substances were thought by some to be precipitated from solution.&lt;ref name="nahste"&gt;[http://www.nahste.ac.uk/cgi-bin/view_isad.pl?id=GB-0237-Wernerian-Natural-History-Society&amp;view=basic Navigational Aids for the History of Science, Technology &amp; the Environment] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070612095914/http://www.nahste.ac.uk/cgi-bin/view_isad.pl?id=GB-0237-Wernerian-Natural-History-Society&amp;view=basic |date=2007-06-12 }}, Records of the Wernerian Natural History Society, UK.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Robert Jameson.jpg|thumb|upright|Robert Jameson, founder and life president of the Wernerian Society.]]
[[Robert Jameson]], [[Regius Professor]] of Natural History at the [[University of Edinburgh]], was the founder and life president of the Society.  In 1800, he spent a year at the mining academy in [[Freiberg, Saxony|Freiberg]], [[Saxony]], where he studied under Werner. The Society was founded on 12 January 1808, and the first meeting of the Society occurred on 2 March 1808.&lt;ref name="SSP"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sweet"&gt;Sweet, Jessie M. ''The Wernerian Natural History Society in Edinburgh''. Freiberger Forschungshefte, Reihe C. (1967) '''223''': 205–218.&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1811 and 1839 eight volumes of  ''Memoirs of the Wernerian Natural History Society'' appeared. More than twelve of Jameson's papers on geology and mineralogy were published in these volumes, and he also contributed some on zoology and botany. Proceedings after 1839 were published in Jameson's ''[[Edinburgh New Philosophical Journal]]''.&lt;ref name="nahste"/&gt; The Society hosted many of the notable scientists of its day.

==Decline==
There were no meetings from 1850–1856, which coincided with the decline of Jameson himself. It was eventually decided to close the Society down and dispose of its assets, and it finally closed on 16 April 1858.&lt;ref name="SSP" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Sweet" /&gt;

==Letters==
Members of the Wernerian Society were entitled to use the abbreviation M.W.S. after their name.  "Corresponding members", based outside Edinburgh, used the designation C.M.W.S.

The '''Western Front''' was the main [[Theater (warfare)|theatre of war]] during the [[First World War]]. Following the outbreak of war in August 1914, the [[German Army (German Empire)|German Army]] opened the Western Front by invading [[Luxembourg]] and [[Belgium]], then gaining military control of important industrial regions in [[Third Republic of France|France]]. The tide of the advance was dramatically turned with the [[First Battle of the Marne|Battle of the Marne]]. Following the [[Race to the Sea]], both sides dug in along a meandering line of fortified [[trench warfare|trenches]], stretching from the [[North Sea]] to the [[Switzerland|Swiss]] frontier with France, which changed little except during early 1917 and in 1918.

Between 1915 and 1917 there were several offensives along this [[Front (military)|front]]. The attacks employed massive [[artillery]] bombardments and massed [[infantry]] advances. Entrenchments, machine gun emplacements, [[barbed wire]] and artillery repeatedly inflicted severe casualties during attacks and counter-attacks and no significant advances were made. Among the most costly of these offensives were the [[Battle of Verdun]], in 1916, with a combined 700,000 casualties (estimated), the [[Battle of the Somme]], also in 1916, with more than a million casualties (estimated), and the [[Battle of Passchendaele]] (Third Battle of Ypres), in 1917, with 487,000 casualties (estimated).{{sfn|Liddle|1997|pp=45–58}}{{sfn|Edmonds|1991|pp=361–363}}

To break the deadlock of trench warfare on the Western Front, both sides tried [[Technology during World War I|new military technology]], including [[Chemical weapons in World War I|poison gas]], [[aircraft]] and [[tank]]s. The adoption of better tactics and the cumulative weakening of the armies in the west led to the return of mobility in 1918. The German [[Spring Offensive]] of 1918 was made possible by the [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk (Russia–Central Powers)|Treaty of Brest-Litovsk]] that ended the war of the Central Powers against Russia and Romania on the [[Eastern Front (World War I)|Eastern Front]]. Using short, intense [[Hurricane bombardment|"hurricane" bombardments]] and [[infiltration tactics]], the German armies moved nearly {{convert|60|mi|km|abbr=off|order=flip|sigfig=1}} to the west, the deepest advance by either side since 1914, but the result was indecisive.

The inexorable advance of the [[Allies of World War I|Allied]] armies during the second half of 1918 caused a sudden collapse of the German armies and persuaded the German commanders that defeat was inevitable. The German government surrendered in the [[Armistice of 11 November 1918]], and the terms of peace were settled by the [[Treaty of Versailles]] in 1919.

At the outbreak of the First World War, the German Army, with seven field armies in the west and one in the east, executed a modified version of the [[Schlieffen Plan]], moving quickly through neutral Belgium to attack France, and then turning southwards to encircle the [[French Army]] and trap it on the German border.{{sfn|Hamilton|Herwig|2003|p=159}} The Western Front was the place where the most powerful military forces in Europe, the German and French armies, met and where the war was decided.{{sfn|Stevenson|2005|pp=44–45}} Belgian neutrality had been guaranteed by Britain under the [[Treaty of London (1839)|Treaty of London, 1839]]; this caused Britain to join the war at the expiration of its ultimatum at 11&amp;nbsp;pm GMT on 4 August. Armies under German generals [[Alexander von Kluck]] and [[Karl von Bülow]] attacked Belgium on 4 August 1914. [[Luxembourg]] had been occupied without opposition on 2 August. The first battle in Belgium was the [[Battle of Liège|Siege of Liège]], which lasted from 5–16 August. Liège was well fortified and surprised the German Army under Bülow with its level of resistance. German heavy artillery was able to demolish the main forts within a few days.{{sfn|Griffith|2004|p=9}} Following the fall of Liège, most of the Belgian field army [[Withdrawal (military)|retreated]] to [[Siege of Antwerp (1914)|Antwerp]], leaving the garrison of [[Namur (city)|Namur]] isolated, with the Belgian capital, [[Brussels]], falling to the Germans on 20 August. Although the German army bypassed Antwerp, it remained a threat to their flank. Another [[Siege of Namur (1914)|siege]] followed at Namur, lasting from about 20–23 August.{{sfn|Griffiths|1986|pp=22–24, 25–26}}

The French deployed five armies on the frontier. The French [[Plan XVII]] was intended to bring about the capture of [[Alsace-Lorraine]].{{sfn|Hamilton|Herwig|2003|p=254}} On 7 August, the VII Corps attacked Alsace to capture Mulhouse and Colmar. The main offensive was launched on 14 August with the First and Second Armies attacking toward Sarrebourg-Morhange in Lorraine.{{sfn|Griffiths|2003|p=30}} In keeping with the Schlieffen Plan, the Germans withdrew slowly while inflicting severe losses upon the French. The French Third and Fourth Armies advanced toward the [[Saar River]] and attempted to capture Saarburg, attacking Briey and Neufchateau but were repulsed.{{sfn|Griffiths|1986|pp=29–30}} The French VII Corps captured Mulhouse after a brief engagement on 7 August but German reserve forces engaged them in the [[Battle of Mulhouse]] and forced a French retreat.{{sfn|Smith|Audoin-Rouzeau|Becker|2003|p=33}}

The German Army swept through Belgium, executing civilians and razing villages. The application of "collective responsibility" against a civilian population further galvanised the allies. Newspapers condemned the German invasion, violence against civilians and destruction of property, which became known as the "[[Rape of Belgium]]".{{sfn|Horne|Kramer|2001|pp=1–608}}{{efn|A modern author uses the term only in the narrower sense of describing the [[war crime]]s committed by the Germans during this period.{{sfn|Zuckerman|2004|p=23}}}} After marching through Belgium, Luxembourg and the [[Ardennes]], the Germans advanced into northern France in late August, where they met the French Army, under [[Joseph Joffre]], and the [[Division (military)|divisions]] of the British [[British Expeditionary Force (World War I)|Expeditionary Force]]&lt;!--wasn't called "British" until Indian troops arrived--&gt; under [[Field Marshal]] [[John French, 1st Earl of Ypres|Sir John French]]. A series of engagements known as the [[Battle of the Frontiers]] ensued, which included the [[Battle of Charleroi]] and the [[Battle of Mons]]. In the former battle the French Fifth Army was almost destroyed by the German 2nd and 3rd Armies and the latter delayed the German advance by a day. A general Allied retreat followed, resulting in more clashes at the [[Battle of Le Cateau]], the [[Siege of Maubeuge]] and the [[Battle of St. Quentin (1914)|Battle of St. Quentin]] (also called the First Battle of Guise).{{sfn|Terraine|2002|pp=78–175}}

=== First Battle of the Marne ===

{{Main|First Battle of the Marne}}

The German Army came within {{convert|70|km|mi|abbr=on}} of Paris but at the [[First Battle of the Marne]] (6–12 September), French and British troops were able to force a German retreat by exploiting a gap which appeared between the 1st and 2nd Armies, ending the German advance into France.{{sfn|Strachan|2001|pp=242–262}} The German Army retreated north of the [[Aisne River]] and dug in there, establishing the beginnings of a static western front that was to last for the next three years. Following this German retirement, the opposing forces made reciprocal outflanking manoeuvres, known as the [[Race for the Sea]] and quickly extended their trench systems from the [[Switzerland|Swiss frontier]] to the [[North Sea]].{{sfn|Griffiths|1986|pp=31–37}} The territory occupied by Germany held 64 percent of French [[Pig iron|pig-iron production]], 24 percent of its [[Steelmaking|steel manufacturing]] and 40 percent of the [[Coal mining|coal industry]] – dealing a serious blow to French industry.{{sfn|Kennedy|1989|pp=265–6}}

On the [[Allies of World War I|Entente side]] (those countries opposing the German alliance), the final lines were occupied with the armies of each nation defending a part of the front. From the coast in the north, the primary forces were from Belgium, the British Empire and then France. Following the [[Battle of the Yser]] in October, the Belgian army controlled a {{convert|35|km|mi|abbr=on}} length of [[West Flanders]] along the coast, known as the [[Yser Front]], along the [[Yser]] river and the Yperlee canal, from [[Nieuwpoort, Belgium|Nieuwpoort]] to [[Boezinge|Boesinghe]].{{sfn|Barton|Doyle|Vandewalle|2005|p=17}} Meanwhile, the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) occupied a position on the flank, having previous occupied a more central position.{{sfn|Baldwin|1962|p=27}}

=== First Battle of Ypres ===

{{Main|First Battle of Ypres}}

From 19 October until 22 November, the German forces made their final breakthrough attempt of 1914 during the [[First Battle of Ypres]], which ended in a mutually-costly stalemate.{{sfn|Strachan|2001|pp=273–278}}  After the battle, [[Erich von Falkenhayn]] judged that it was no longer possible for Germany to win the war by purely military means and on 18 November 1914 he called for a diplomatic solution. The Chancellor, [[Theobald von Bethmann-Hollweg]]; ''Generalfeldmarschall'' [[Paul von Hindenburg]], commanding ''[[Ober Ost]]'' (Eastern Front high command); and Hindenburg's deputy, [[Erich Ludendorff]], continued to believe that victory was achievable through decisive battles. During the Lodz offensive in Poland {{nowrap|(11–25 November),}} Falkenhayn hoped that the Russians would be made amenable to peace overtures. In his discussions with Bethmann-Hollweg, Falkenhayn viewed Germany and Russia as having no insoluble conflict and that the real enemies of Germany were France and Britain. A peace with only a few annexations of territory also seemed possible with France and that with Russia and France out of the war by negotiated settlements, Germany could concentrate on Britain and fight a long war with the resources of Europe at its disposal. Hindenburg and Ludendorff continued to believe that Russia could be defeated by a series of battles which cumulatively would have a decisive effect, after which Germany could finish off France and Britain.{{sfn|Foley|2005|pp=105–110}}

== 1915 ==

[[File:Western front 1915-16.jpg|thumb|Map of the Western Front, 1915–16]]
Between the coast and the [[Vosges Mountains|Vosges]] was a westward bulge in the trench line, named the [[Noyon]] salient for the captured French town at the maximum point of advance near [[Compiègne]]. Joffre's plan for 1915 was to attack the [[Salients, re-entrants and pockets|salient]] on both flanks to cut it off.{{sfn|Fuller|1992|p=165}} The Fourth Army had attacked in Champagne from 20 December 1914&amp;nbsp;– 17 March 1915 but the French were not able to attack in Artois at the same time. The [[Tenth Army (France)|Tenth Army]] formed the northern attack force and was to attack eastwards into the Douai plain across a {{convert|16|km|mi|adj=on}} front between Loos and Arras.{{sfn|Neiberg|2008|p=110}} On 10 March, as part of the larger offensive in the Artois region, the [[British Army]] fought the [[Battle of Neuve Chapelle]] to capture Aubers Ridge. The assault was made by four divisions along a {{convert|2|mi|km|abbr=on}} front. Preceded by a surprise bombardment lasting only 35 minutes, the initial assault made rapid progress and the village was captured within four hours. The advance then slowed because of supply and communication difficulties. The Germans brought up [[Military reserves|reserves]] and [[counter-attack]]ed, forestalling the attempt to capture the ridge. Since the British had used about one-third of their supply of [[Shell (projectile)|artillery ammunition]], General Sir John French blamed the failure on the [[Shell Crisis of 1915|shortage of ammunition]], despite the early success.{{sfn|Lyons|2000|p=112}}{{sfn|Fuller|1992|pp=166–7}}

=== Gas warfare ===

{{Main|Chemical weapons in World War I}}

All sides had signed the [[Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907]], which prohibited the use of chemical weapons in warfare. In 1914, there had been small-scale attempts by both the French and Germans to use various [[tear gas]]es, which were not strictly prohibited by the early treaties but which were also ineffective.{{sfn|Richter|1994|p=7}} The first use of more lethal [[chemical weapons]] was against the French near the Belgian town of [[Ypres]].{{sfn|Doughty|2005|pp=148–151}}

Despite the German plans to maintain the stalemate with the French and British, [[Albrecht, Duke of Württemberg]], commander of the [[4th Army (German Empire)|4th Army]] planned an offensive at Ypres, site of the First Battle of Ypres in November 1914. The [[Second Battle of Ypres]], April 1915, was intended to divert attention from offensives in the [[Eastern Front (World War I)|Eastern Front]] and disrupt Franco-British planning. After a two-day bombardment, the Germans released [[Poison gas in World War I#1915: Large-scale use and lethal gases|a cloud]] of {{convert|168|LT|t|abbr=on}} of [[Chlorine|chlorine gas]] onto the battlefield. Though primarily a powerful irritant, it can [[asphyxia]]te in high concentrations or prolonged exposure. Being heavier than air, the gas crept across [[No man's land#World War I|no man's land]] and drifted into the French trenches.{{sfn|Fuller|1992|pp=172–3}} The green-yellow cloud started killing some defenders and those in the rear fled in [[panic]], creating an undefended {{convert|6|km|mi|order=flip|adj=on}} gap in the Allied line. The Germans were unprepared for the level of their success and lacked sufficient reserves to exploit the opening. Canadian troops on the right drew back their left flank and halted the German advance.{{sfn|Sheldon|2012|pp=81–95}} The gas attack was repeated two days later and caused a {{convert|5|km|mi|order=flip|abbr=on}} withdrawal of the Franco-British line but the opportunity had been lost.{{sfn|Sheldon|2012|pp=95–121}}

The success of this attack would not be repeated, as the Allies countered by introducing gas masks and other [[countermeasure]]s. An example of the success of these measures came a year later, on 27 April in the [[Gas attacks at Hulluch]] {{convert|25|mi|km|order=flip|abbr=on}} to the south of Ypres, where the [[16th (Irish) Division]] withstood several German gas attacks.{{sfn|Jones|2002|pp=22–23}} The British retaliated, developing their own chlorine gas and using it at the [[Battle of Loos]] in September 1915. Fickle winds and inexperience led to more British casualties from the gas than German.{{sfn|Richter|1994|pp=69–73, 88}} French, British and German forces all escalated the use of gas attacks through the rest of the war, developing the more deadly [[phosgene]] gas in 1915, then the infamous [[mustard gas]] in 1917, which could linger for days and could kill slowly and painfully. Countermeasures also improved and the stalemate continued.{{sfn|Richter|1994|pp=182–183, 210–211}}

=== Air warfare ===

Specialised aeroplanes for aerial combat were introduced in 1915. Aircraft were already in use for scouting and on 1 April, the French pilot [[Roland Garros (aviator)|Roland Garros]] became the first to shoot down an enemy aircraft by using a machine-gun that shot forward through the propeller blades. This was achieved by crudely reinforcing the blades to deflect bullets.{{sfn|Spick|2002|pp=326–327}} Several weeks later Garros force-landed behind German lines. His aeroplane was captured and sent to Dutch engineer [[Anthony Fokker]], who soon produced a significant improvement, the [[synchronization gear|interrupter gear]], in which the machine gun is synchronised with the propeller so it fires in the intervals when the blades of the propeller are out of the line of fire. This advance was quickly ushered into service, in the [[Fokker E.I]] (''Eindecker'', or monoplane, Mark 1), the first single seat [[fighter aircraft]] to combine a reasonable maximum speed with an effective armament. [[Max Immelmann]] scored the first confirmed kill in an ''Eindecker'' on 1 August.{{sfn|Wise|1981|pp=349–350}} Both sides developed improved weapons, engines, airframes and materials, until the end of the war. It also inaugurated the cult of the [[flying ace|ace]], the most famous being [[Manfred von Richthofen]] (the Red Baron). Contrary to the myth, [[Antiaircraft warfare|anti-aircraft fire]] claimed more kills than fighters.{{sfn|Granatstein|Morton|2003|p=40}}

=== Spring offensive ===

[[File:Capture of Carency aftermath 1915 1.jpg|thumb|Ruins of [[Carency]] after it was recaptured by France]]
The final Entente offensive of the spring was the [[Second Battle of Artois]], an offensive to capture [[Vimy Ridge]] and advance into the Douai plain. The French Tenth Army attacked on 9 May after a six-day bombardment and advanced {{convert|3|mi|km|order=flip|0}} to capture Vimy Ridge. German reinforcements counter-attacked and pushed the French back towards their starting points because French reserves had been held back and the success of the attack had come as a surprise. By 15 May the advance had been stopped, although the fighting continued until 18 June.{{sfn|Smith|Audoin-Rouzeau|Becker|2003|pp=79–80}} In May the German Army captured a French document at [[La Ville-aux-Bois]] describing a new system of defence. Rather than relying on a heavily fortified front line, the defence was to be arranged in a series of echelons. The front line would be a thinly manned series of outposts, reinforced by a series of strongpoints and a sheltered reserve. If a slope was available, troops were deployed along the rear side for protection. The defence became fully integrated with command of artillery at the divisional level. Members of the German high command viewed this new scheme with some favour and it later became the basis of an elastic [[defence in depth]] doctrine against Entente attacks.{{sfn|Herwig|1997|p=165}}{{sfn|Lupfer|1981|pp=1–36}}

During the autumn of 1915, the "[[Fokker Scourge]]" began to have an effect on the battlefront as Allied reconnaissance aircraft were nearly driven from the skies. These [[reconnaissance]] planes were used to direct gunnery and photograph enemy fortifications but now the Allies were nearly blinded by German fighters.{{sfn|Campbell|1981|pp=26–27}} However, the impact of German air superiority was diminished by their primarily defensive doctrine in which they tended to remain over their own lines, rather than fighting over Allied held territory.{{sfn|Griffith|1994|pp=155–156}}

=== Autumn offensive ===

In September 1915 the Entente allies launched another offensive, with the French [[Third Battle of Artois]], [[Second Battle of Champagne]] and the British at Loos. The French had spent the summer preparing for this action, with the British assuming control of more of the front to release French troops for the attack. The bombardment, which had been carefully targeted by means of [[aerial photography]],{{sfn|Bailey|2004|p=245}} began on 22 September. The main French assault was launched on 25 September and, at first, made good progress in spite of surviving wire entanglements and machine gun posts. Rather than retreating, the Germans adopted a new [[defence-in-depth]] scheme that consisted of a series of defensive zones and positions with a depth of up to {{convert|5|mi|km|abbr=on|order=flip}}.{{sfn|Samuels|1995|pp=168–171}}

On 25 September, the British began the [[Battle of Loos]], part of the Third Battle of Artois, which was meant to supplement the larger Champagne attack. The attack was preceded by a four-day artillery bombardment of 250,000 shells and a release of 5,100 cylinders of chlorine gas.{{sfn|Palazzo|2000|p=66}}{{sfn|Hartesveldt|2005|p=17}} The attack involved two corps in the main assault and two corps performing diversionary attacks at Ypres. The British suffered heavy losses, especially due to machine gun fire during the attack and made only limited gains before they ran out of shells. A renewal of the attack on 13 October fared little better.{{sfn|Warner|2000|pp=4–31}} In December, French was replaced by General [[Douglas Haig, 1st Earl Haig|Douglas Haig]] as commander of the British forces.{{sfn|Wiest|2005|p=xvii}}

== 1916 ==

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-R05148, Westfront, deutscher Soldat crop.jpg|thumb|German soldier on the Western Front in 1916]]
Falkenhayn believed that a breakthrough might no longer be possible and instead focused on forcing a French defeat by inflicting massive casualties.{{sfn|Lyons|2000|p=141}} His new goal was to "bleed France white".{{sfn|Knox|2007|p=153}} As such, he adopted two new strategies. The first was the use of [[unrestricted submarine warfare]] to cut off Allied supplies arriving from overseas.{{sfn|Hull|2005|pp=295–296}} The second would be attacks against the French army intended to inflict maximum casualties; Falkenhayn planned to attack a position from which the French could not retreat, for reasons of strategy and [[Patriotism|national pride]] and thus trap the French. The town of [[Verdun]] was chosen for this because it was an important stronghold, surrounded by a ring of forts, that lay near the German lines and because it guarded the direct route to Paris.{{sfn|Foley|2005|pp=207–208}}

Falkenhayn limited the size of the front to {{convert|3|–|4|mi|km|0|order=flip}} to concentrate artillery firepower and to prevent a breakthrough from a counter-offensive. He also kept tight control of the main reserve, feeding in just enough troops to keep the battle going.{{sfn|Marshall|1964|pp=236–7}} In preparation for their attack, the Germans had amassed a concentration of aircraft near the fortress. In the opening phase, they swept the air space of French aircraft, which allowed German artillery-observation aircraft and bombers to operate without interference. In May, the French countered by deploying ''escadrilles de chasse'' with superior [[Nieuport]] fighters and the air over Verdun turned into a battlefield as both sides fought for [[air superiority]].{{sfn|Campbell|1981|p=40}}

=== Battle of Verdun ===

{{Main|Battle of Verdun}}

[[File:Soldats Argonne 2.jpg|thumb|French soldiers observing enemy movements]]
The [[Battle of Verdun]] began on 21 February 1916 after a nine-day delay due to snow and blizzards. After a massive eight-hour artillery bombardment, the Germans did not expect much resistance as they slowly advanced on Verdun and its forts.{{sfn|Lyons|2000|p=143}} Sporadic French resistance was encountered. The Germans took [[Fort Douaumont]] and then reinforcements halted the German advance by 28 February.{{sfn|Martin|2001|pp=28–83}}

The Germans turned their focus to [[Le Mort Homme]] on the west bank of the Meuse which blocked the route to French artillery emplacements, from which the French fired across the river. After some of the most intense fighting of the campaign, the hill was taken by the Germans in late May. After a change in French command at Verdun from the defensive-minded [[Philippe Pétain]] to the offensive-minded [[Robert Nivelle]], the French attempted to re-capture Fort Douaumont on 22 May but were easily repulsed. The Germans captured [[Fort Vaux]] on 7 June and with the aid of [[diphosgene]] gas, came within {{convert|1|km|yd}} of the last ridge before Verdun before being contained on 23 June.{{sfn|Jones|Hook|2007|pp=23–24}}

Over the summer, the French slowly advanced. With the development of the rolling [[barrage (artillery)|barrage]], the French recaptured Fort Vaux in November and by December 1916 they had pushed the Germans back {{convert|1.3|mi|km|order=flip}} from Fort Douaumont, in the process rotating 42 divisions through the battle. The Battle of Verdun—also known as the 'Mincing Machine of Verdun' or 'Meuse Mill'{{sfn|Foley|2005|p=224}}—became a symbol of French determination and self-sacrifice.{{sfn|Jackson|2001|p=28}}

=== Battle of the Somme ===

{{Main|Battle of the Somme}}

[[File:British infantry Morval 25 September 1916.jpg|thumb|British infantry advance near Ginchy. Photo by [[Ernest Brooks (photographer)|Ernest Brooks]].]]
In the spring, Allied commanders had been concerned about the ability of the French Army to withstand the enormous losses at Verdun. The original plans for an attack around the [[River Somme]] were modified to let the British make the main effort. This would serve to relieve pressure on the French, as well as the Russians who had also suffered great losses. On 1 July, after a week of heavy rain, British divisions in [[Picardy]] began the Battle of the Somme with the [[Battle of Albert (1916)|Battle of Albert]], supported by five French divisions on their right flank. The attack had been preceded by seven days of heavy artillery bombardment. The experienced French forces were successful in advancing but the British artillery cover had neither blasted away barbed wire, nor destroyed German trenches as effectively as was planned. They suffered the greatest number of casualties (killed, wounded and missing) in a single day in the history of the British Army, about 57,000.{{sfn|Griffiths|1986|pp=71–72}}

The Verdun lesson learnt, the Allies' tactical aim became the achievement of air superiority and until September, German aircraft were swept from the skies over the Somme. The success of the Allied air offensive caused a reorganisation of the German air arm and both sides began using large formations of aircraft rather than relying on individual combat.{{sfn|Campbell|1981|p=42}} After regrouping, the battle continued throughout July and August, with some success for the British despite the reinforcement of the German lines. By August, General Haig had concluded that a breakthrough was unlikely and instead, switched tactics to a series of [[Military unit|small unit]] actions.{{sfn|Baldwin|1962|p=79}} The effect was to straighten out the front line, which was thought necessary in preparation for a massive artillery bombardment with a major push.{{sfn|Rawson|2014|pp=140–158}}

The final phase of the battle of the Somme saw the first use of the [[tank]] on the battlefield.{{sfn|Miles|1992|pp=245–249}} The Allies prepared an attack that would involve 13 British and Imperial divisions and four French corps. The attack made early progress, advancing {{convert|3,500|–|4,500|yd|m|order=flip}} in places but the tanks had little effect due to their lack of numbers and mechanical unreliability.{{sfn|Prior|Wilson|2005|pp=280–281}} The final phase of the battle took place in October and early November, again producing limited gains with heavy loss of life. All told, the Somme battle had made penetrations of only {{convert|8|km|0}} and failed to reach the original objectives. The British had suffered about 420,000 casualties and the French around 200,000. It is estimated that the Germans lost 465,000, although this figure is controversial.{{sfn|Watson|2008|p=11}}

The Somme led directly to major new developments in infantry organisation and tactics; despite the terrible losses of 1 July, some divisions had managed to achieve their objectives with minimal casualties. In examining the reasons behind losses and achievements, once the British war economy produced sufficient equipment and weapons, the army made the platoon the basic tactical unit, similar to the French and German armies. At the time of the Somme, British senior commanders insisted that the company (120 men) was the smallest unit of manoeuvre; less than a year later, the section of ten men would be so.{{sfn|Corkerry|2001|p=88}}

=== Hindenburg line ===

{{Main|Hindenburg Line}}

[[File:Hindenberg line bullecourt.jpg|thumb|The Hindenburg Line at [[Bullecourt]] seen from the air]]
In August 1916 the German leadership along the western front had changed as Falkenhayn resigned and was replaced by Hindenburg and Ludendorff. The new leaders soon recognised that the battles of Verdun and the Somme had depleted the offensive capabilities of the German Army. They decided that the German Army in the west would go over to the strategic defensive for most of 1917, while the Central powers would attack elsewhere.{{sfn|Herwig|1997|pp=246–252}}

During the Somme battle and through the winter months, the Germans created a [[fortification]] behind the Noyon Salient that would be called the Hindenburg Line, using the defensive principles elaborated since the defensive battles of 1915, including the use of [[Eingreif division]]s.{{sfn|Wynne|1976|p=290}} This was intended to shorten the German front, freeing 10 divisions for other duties. This line of fortifications ran from [[Arras]] south to [[Saint-Quentin, Aisne|St Quentin]] and shortened the front by about {{convert|30|mi|km|sigfig=1|order=flip}}.{{sfn|Herwig|1997|pp=246–252}} British long-range reconnaissance aircraft first spotted the construction of the Hindenburg Line in November 1916.{{sfn|Dockrill|French|1996|p=68}}

The Hindenburg Line was built between 2{{sfn|Marshall|1964|pp=288–9}} and {{convert|30|mi|km|sigfig=1|order=flip}} behind the German front line. On 25 February German forces began retreating to the line and the withdrawal was completed on 5 April, leaving behind a [[Scorched earth|devastated territory]] to be occupied by the Allies. This withdrawal negated the French strategy of attacking both flanks of the Noyon salient, as it no longer existed.{{sfn|Baldwin|1962|p=99}} However, offensive advances by the British continued as the [[War Office|High Command]] claimed, with some justice, that this withdrawal resulted from the casualties the Germans received during the Battles of the Somme and Verdun, despite the Allies suffering greater losses.{{sfn|Neiberg|2004|p=46}}

Meanwhile, on 6 April the United States declared war on Germany. In early 1915, following the sinking of the {{RMS|Lusitania||2}}, Germany had stopped its unrestricted submarine warfare in the Atlantic because of concerns of drawing the United States into the conflict. With the growing discontent of the German public due to the food shortages, however, the government resumed unrestricted submarine warfare in February 1917. They had calculated that a successful submarine and warship siege of Britain would force that country out of the war within six months, while American forces would take a year to become a serious factor on the Western Front. The [[submarine]] and surface ships had a long period of success before Britain resorted to the convoy system, bringing a large reduction in shipping losses.{{sfn|Griffiths|1986|pp=144–5}}

[[File:The British Army on the Western Front, 1914-1918 Q5925.jpg|thumb|British Army on the Western Front (August 1917)]]
By 1917, the size of the British Army on the Western Front had grown to two-thirds the total numbers in the French forces.{{sfn|Kennedy|1989|pp=265–6}} In April 1917 the BEF began the [[Battle of Arras (1917)|Battle of Arras]].{{sfn|Baldwin|1962|pp=99–100}} The [[Canadian Corps]] and the [[5th Infantry Division (United Kingdom)|5th Division]], attacked German lines at [[Battle of Vimy Ridge|Vimy Ridge]], capturing the heights and the First Army to the south achieved the deepest advance since trench warfare began. Later attacks were confronted by German reinforcements defending the area using the lessons learned on the Somme in 1916. British attacks were contained and, according to Gary Sheffield, a greater rate of daily loss was inflicted on the British than in "any other major battle".{{sfn|Sheffield|2014|loc=Chapter 7}}

During the winter of 1916–1917, German air tactics had been improved, a fighter training school was opened at [[Valenciennes]] and better aircraft with twin guns were introduced. The result was near disastrous losses for Allied air power, particularly for the British, Portuguese, Belgians and Australians who were struggling with outmoded aircraft, poor training and weak tactics. As a result, the Allied air successes over the Somme would not be repeated and heavy losses were inflicted by the Germans. During their attack at Arras, the British lost 316 [[Aircrew member|air crews]] and the Canadians lost 114 compared to 44 lost by the Germans.{{sfn|Campbell|1981|p=71}} This became known to the [[Royal Flying Corps]] as [[Bloody April]].{{sfn|Hart|2005|pp=11–13}}

=== Nivelle Offensive ===

{{Main|Battle of Arras (1917)|Nivelle Offensive}}

The same month, the French [[Commander-in-chief|Commander-in-Chief]], General Robert Nivelle, ordered a new offensive against the German trenches, promising that it would end the war within 48 hours. The 16 April attack, dubbed the [[Nivelle Offensive]] (also known as the [[Second Battle of the Aisne]], after the area where the offensive took place), would be 1.2 million men strong, preceded by a week-long artillery bombardment and accompanied by tanks. The offensive proceeded poorly as the French troops, with the help of two [[Russian Expeditionary Force in France|Russian brigades]], had to negotiate rough, upward-sloping terrain in extremely bad weather.{{sfn|Cockfield|1999|pp=91–114}} Planning had been dislocated by the voluntary German withdrawal to the Hindenburg Line. Secrecy had been compromised and German aircraft gained air superiority, making reconnaissance difficult and in places, the creeping barrage moved too fast for the French troops.{{sfn|Uffindell|2015|p=26}} Within a week the French suffered 120,000 casualties. Despite the casualties and his promise to halt the offensive if it did not produce a breakthrough, Nivelle ordered the attack to continue into May.{{sfn|Baldwin|1962|pp=99–100}}

On 3 May the weary French 2nd Colonial Division, veterans of the Battle of Verdun, refused orders, arriving drunk and without their weapons. Lacking the means to punish an entire division, its officers did not immediately implement harsh measures against the mutineers. [[French Army Mutinies|Mutinies]] occurred in 54 French divisions&lt;!-- yes "54 divisions" plural, not a division number --&gt; and 20,000 men deserted. Other Allied forces attacked but suffered massive casualties.{{sfn|Lyons|2000|p=243}} Appeals to patriotism and duty followed, as did mass arrests and trials. The French soldiers returned to defend their trenches but refused to participate in further offensive action.{{sfn|Marshall|1964|p=292}} On 15 May Nivelle was removed from command, replaced by Pétain who immediately stopped the offensive.{{sfn|Neiberg|2003|p=53}} The French would go on the defensive for the following months to avoid high casualties and to restore confidence in the French High Command, while the British assumed greater responsibility.{{sfn|Baldwin|1962|pp=101–102}}

===American Expeditionary Force===

On 25 June the first US troops began to arrive in France, forming the [[American Expeditionary Forces|American Expeditionary Force]]. However, the American units did not enter the trenches in [[1st Infantry Division (United States)|divisional strength]] until October. The incoming troops required training and equipment before they could join in the effort, and for several months American units were relegated to support efforts.{{sfn|Griffiths|1986|p=124}} In spite of this, however, their presence provided a much-needed boost to Allied morale, with the promise of further reinforcements that could tip the manpower balance towards the Allies.{{sfn|Baldwin|1962|p=144}}

=== Flanders offensive ===

{{Main|Battle of Messines (1917)|Third Battle of Ypres}}

[[File:At close grips2.jpg|thumb|Two British soldiers run toward a bunker past the bodies of two German soldiers.]]
In June, the British launched an offensive in Flanders, in part to take pressure off the French armies on the Aisne, after the French part of the Nivelle Offensive failed to achieve the strategic victory that had been planned and French troops [[1917 French Army mutinies|began to mutiny]].{{sfn|Baldwin|1962|pp=101–102}} The offensive began on 7 June, with a British attack on [[Battle of Messines (1917)|Messines Ridge]], south of Ypres, to retake the ground lost in the First and Second battles in 1914. Since 1915 specialist [[Royal Engineer tunnelling companies]] had been digging tunnels under the ridge, and about {{convert|500|t|LT|abbr=on}} of explosives had been planted in 21 mines under the German defences.{{sfn|Bostyn|2002|p=227}} Following several weeks of bombardment, the explosives in 19 of these mines were detonated, killing up to 7,000 German troops. The infantry advance that followed relied on three creeping barrages which the British infantry followed to capture the plateau and the east side of the ridge in one day. German counter-attacks were defeated and the southern flank of the Gheluvelt plateau was protected from German observation.{{sfn|Edmonds|1991|p=87}}

On 11 July 1917, during [[Operation Hush|''Unternehmen Strandfest'']] (Operation Beachparty) at Nieuport on the coast, the Germans introduced a new weapon into the war when they fired a powerful blistering agent [[Sulfur mustard]] (Yellow Cross) gas. The artillery deployment allowed heavy concentrations of the gas to be used on selected targets. Mustard gas was persistent and could contaminate an area for days, denying it to the British, an additional demoralising factor. The Allies increased production of [[Chemical weapons in World War I|gas for chemical warfare]] but took until late 1918 to copy the Germans and begin using mustard gas.{{sfn|Sheldon|2007|pp=35–36, 39}}

From 31 July to 10 November the [[Third Battle of Ypres]] included the [[First Battle of Passchendaele]] and culminated in the [[Second Battle of Passchendaele]].{{sfn|Liddle|2013|p=112}} The battle had the original aim of capturing the ridges east of Ypres then advancing to Roulers and Thourout to close the main rail line supplying the German garrisons on the Western front north of Ypres. If successful the northern armies were then to capture the German submarine bases on the Belgian coast. It was later restricted to advancing the British Army onto the ridges around Ypres, as the unusually wet weather slowed British progress. The Canadian Corps relieved the [[II ANZAC Corps]] and took the village of Passchendaele on 6 November,{{sfn|Baldwin|1962|p=103}} despite rain, mud and many casualties. The offensive was costly in manpower for both sides for relatively little gain of ground against determined German resistance but the ground captured was of great tactical importance. In the drier periods, the British advance was inexorable and during the unusually wet August and in the Autumn rains that began in early October, the Germans achieved only costly defensive successes, which led the German commanders in early October to begin preparations for a general retreat. Both sides lost a combined total of over a half million men during this offensive.{{sfn|Sheffield|2002|p=216}} The battle has become a byword among some British revisionist historians for bloody and futile slaughter, whilst the Germans called Passchendaele "the greatest martyrdom of the war".{{sfn|Sheldon|2007|pp=vi, 316}}

=== Battle of Cambrai ===

{{Main|Battle of Cambrai (1917)|l1=Battle of Cambrai}}

On 20 November the British launched the first massed tank attack and the first attack using predicted artillery-fire (aiming artillery without firing the guns to obtain target data) at the [[Battle of Cambrai (1917)|Battle of Cambrai]].{{sfn|Miles|1991|pp=13–15, 32–35}} The Allies attacked with 324 tanks (with one-third held in reserve) and twelve divisions, advancing behind a hurricane bombardment, against two German divisions. The machines carried [[fascine]]s on their fronts to bridge trenches and the {{convert|4|m|ft|adj=mid|order=flip|-wide}} German tank traps. Special "grapnel tanks" towed hooks to pull away the German barbed wire. The attack was a great success for the British, who penetrated further in six hours than at the Third Ypres in four months, at a cost of only 4,000 British casualties.{{sfn|Miles|1991|p=88}} The advance produced an awkward salient and a surprise German counter-offensive began on 30 November, which drove back the British in the south and failed in the north. Despite the reversal, the attack was seen as a success by the Allies, proving that tanks could overcome trench defences. The Germans realised that the use of tanks by the Allies posed a new threat to any defensive strategy they might mount. The battle had also seen the first mass use of German ''[[stosstruppen]]'' on the Western front in the attack, who used infantry [[infiltration tactics]] to penetrate British defences, bypassing resistance and quickly advancing into the British rear.{{sfn|Miles|1991|pp=176–248}}

Following the successful Allied attack and penetration of the German defences at Cambrai, Ludendorff and Hindenburg determined that the only opportunity for German victory lay in a decisive attack along the Western front during the spring, before American manpower became overwhelming. On 3 March 1918, the [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk (Russia–Central Powers)|Treaty of Brest-Litovsk]] was signed and Russia withdrew from the war. This would now have a dramatic effect on the conflict as 33 divisions were released from the Eastern Front for deployment to the west. The Germans occupied almost as much Russian territory under the provisions of the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk as they did in the Second World War but this considerably restricted their troop redeployment. The Germans achieved an advantage of 192 divisions in the west to the 178 Allied divisions, which allowed Germany to pull veteran units from the line and retrain them as ''[[Stormtrooper|sturmtruppen]]'' (40 infantry and 3 cavalry divisions were retained for German occupation duties in the east).{{sfn|Herwig|1997|pp=393–397,400–401}}

The Allies lacked unity of command and suffered from morale and manpower problems, the British and French armies were severely depleted and not in a position to attack in the first half of the year, while the majority of the newly arrived American troops were still training, with just six complete divisions in the line.{{sfn|Baldwin|1962|pp=139–140}} Ludendorff decided on an offensive strategy beginning with a big attack against the British on the Somme, to separate them from the French and drive them back to the channel ports.{{sfn|Baldwin|1962|p=140}}{{sfn|Carlyon|2006|p=543}} The attack would combine the new storm troop tactics with over 700 aircraft,{{sfn|Murphy|2005|p=69}} tanks and a carefully planned artillery barrage that would include gas attacks.{{sfn|Baldwin|1962|pp=140–141}}{{sfn|Carlyon|2006|pp=544–545}}

=== German spring offensives ===

{{Main|Spring Offensive}}

Operation Michael, the first of the German [[Spring Offensive]]s, very nearly succeeded in driving the Allied armies apart, advancing to within shelling distance of Paris for the first time since 1914.{{sfn|Marshall|1964|pp=353–357}} As a result of the battle, the Allies agreed on unity of command. General [[Ferdinand Foch]] was appointed commander of all Allied forces in France. The unified Allies were better able to respond to each of the German drives and the offensive turned into a battle of attrition.{{sfn|Baldwin|1962|pp=141–143}} In May, the American divisions also began to play an increasing role, winning their first victory in the [[Battle of Cantigny]]. By summer, between 250,000 and 300,000 American soldiers were arriving every month.{{sfn|Baldwin|1962|p=146}} A total of 2.1 million American troops would be deployed on this front before the war came to an end.{{sfn|Tucker|Roberts|2005|p=1254}} The rapidly increasing American presence served as a counter for the large numbers of redeployed German forces.{{sfn|Baldwin|1962|p=146}}

=== Allied counter-offensives ===

{{Main|Second Battle of the Marne|Hundred Days Offensive|Armistice of 11 November 1918}}

In July, Foch began the [[Second Battle of the Marne]], a counter-offensive against the Marne salient which was eliminated by August. The [[Battle of Amiens (1918)|Battle of Amiens]] began two days later, with Franco-British forces spearheaded by Australian and Canadian troops, along with 600 tanks and 800 aircraft.{{sfn|Ekins|2010|p=24}} Hindenburg named 8 August as the "Black Day of the German army".{{sfn|Griffiths|1986|pp=155–156}} The Italian 2nd Corps, commanded by General [[Alberico Albricci]], also participated in the operations around Reims.{{sfn|Edmonds|1994|pp=2, 31, 242, 245–246}} German manpower had been severely depleted after four years of war and its economy and society were under great internal strain. The Allies fielded 216 divisions against 197 German divisions.{{sfn|Kennedy|1989|pp=266–302}} The [[Hundred Days Offensive]] beginning in August proved the final straw and following this string of military defeats, German troops began to surrender in large numbers.{{sfn|Herwig|1997|pp=426–428}} As the Allied forces advanced, [[Prince Maximilian of Baden]] was appointed as [[Chancellor of Germany (German Reich)|Chancellor of Germany]] in October to negotiate an armistice. Ludendorff was forced out and fled to [[Sweden]].{{sfn|Herwig|1997|pp=426–428}} The German retreat continued and the [[German Revolution]] put a new government in power. The Armistice of Compiègne was quickly signed, stopping hostilities on the Western Front on 11 November 1918, later known as [[Armistice Day]].{{sfn|Griffiths|1986|p=163}} The German [[Wilhelm II of Germany|Imperial Monarchy]] collapsed when [[Wilhelm Groener|General Groener]], the successor to Ludendorff, backed the moderate Social Democratic Government under [[Friedrich Ebert]], to forestall a revolution like those in Russia the previous year.{{sfn|Herwig|1997|p=446}}

The war along the Western Front led the German government and its allies to sue for peace in spite of German success elsewhere. As a result, the terms of the peace were dictated by France, Britain and the United States, during the 1919 [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference]]. The result was the [[Treaty of Versailles]], signed in June 1919 by a delegation of the new German government.{{sfn|Carlyon|2006|pp=743 &amp; 760}} The terms of the treaty constrained Germany as an economic and military power. The Versailles treaty returned the border provinces of Alsace-Lorraine to France, thus limiting the coal required by&lt;!--"available to"?--&gt; German industry. The [[Saar (League of Nations)|Saar]], which formed the west bank of the Rhine, would be demilitarised and controlled by Britain and France, while the [[Kiel Canal]] opened to international traffic. The treaty also drastically reshaped Eastern Europe. It severely limited the German armed forces by restricting the size of the army to 100,000 and disallowing a navy or air force. The navy was sailed to [[Scapa Flow]] under the terms of surrender but was later [[Scuttling of the German fleet at Scapa Flow|scuttled as a reaction to the treaty]].{{sfn|Massie|2004|p=787}}

=== Casualties ===

{{Main|Casualties of World War I}}

The war in the trenches of the Western Front left tens of thousands of maimed soldiers and war widows. The unprecedented loss of life had a lasting effect on popular attitudes toward war, resulting later in an Allied reluctance to pursue an aggressive policy toward [[Adolf Hitler]].{{sfn|Adamthwaite|1989|pp=25–26}} Belgium suffered 30,000 civilian dead and France 40,000 (including 3,000 merchant sailors).{{sfn|Grey|1991|p=292}} The British lost {{nowrap|16,829}} civilian dead, {{nowrap|1,260 civilians}} were killed in air and naval attacks, {{nowrap|908 civilians}} were killed at sea and there were {{nowrap|14,661 merchant}} marine deaths.{{sfn|ASB|1922|p=100}}{{sfn|Ellis|1993|p=269}} Another 62,000 Belgian, 107,000 British and 300,000 French civilians died due to war-related causes.{{sfn|Hersch|1927|pp=47–61}}

=== Economic costs ===

{{See also|French war planning 1920–1940}}

Germany in 1919 was bankrupt, the people living in a state of semi-starvation and having no commerce with the remainder of the world. The Allies occupied the Rhine cities of Cologne, Koblenz and Mainz, with restoration dependent on payment of reparations. In Germany a [[Stab-in-the-back myth]] (''Dolchstoßlegende'') was propagated by Hindenburg, Ludendorff and other defeated generals, that the defeat was not the fault of the 'good core' of the army but due to certain left-wing groups within Germany who signed a disastrous armistice; this would later be exploited by nationalists and the [[Nazism|Nazi]] party propaganda to excuse the overthrow of the [[Weimar Republic]] in 1930 and the imposition of the Nazi dictatorship after March 1933.{{sfn|Herwig|1996|pp=87–127}}

France lost more casualties relative to its population than any other great power and the industrial north-east of the country was devastated by the war. The provinces overrun by Germany had produced 40 percent of French coal and 58 percent of its steel output.{{sfn|Chickering|Förster|2000|p=297}} Once it was clear that Germany was going to be defeated, Ludendorff had ordered the destruction of the mines in France and Belgium.{{sfn|Marshall|1964|p=460}} His goal was to cripple the industries of Germany's main European rival. To prevent similar German attacks in the future, France later built a massive series of fortifications along the German border known as the [[Maginot Line]].{{sfn|Alexander|2003|p=180}}

'''William L. "Bill" Chameides''' (born November 21, 1949 in New York City) is an American atmospheric scientist who was the dean of [[Duke University]]'s [[Nicholas School of the Environment]] from 2007 until July 1, 2014.&lt;ref name=Nature&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Gewin | first1 = V. | title = William Chameides, dean, Nicholas School of the Environment and Earth Sciences, Duke University, Durham, North Carolina | doi = 10.1038/nj7158-112a | journal = Nature | volume = 449 | issue = 7158 | pages = 112–115 | year = 2007 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.dukechronicle.com/articles/2014/07/01/nicholas-school-welcomes-new-dean-new-building | title=Nicholas School welcomes new dean, new building | work=[[Duke Chronicle]] | date=1 July 2014 | accessdate=4 July 2014 | author=Wang, Grace}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is an ISI highly cited researcher,&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20140107110247/http://highlycited.com/names/C.html Highly Cited Researchers with last names beginning with C]&lt;/ref&gt; as well as a member of the [[National Academy of Sciences]] and a fellow of the [[American Geophysical Union]].&lt;ref name=Duke/&gt; In December 2013, Chameides announced that he would be stepping down from his position at Duke the following June, saying that he "feels comfortable stepping down now given that he has accomplished many of his initial goals."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.dukechronicle.com/articles/2013/12/03/chameides-step-down-june-2014 | title=Chameides to step down in June 2014 | work=[[The Chronicle (Duke University)|The Chronicle]] | date=3 December 2013 | accessdate=2 February 2014 | author=Zhang, Ryan}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was replaced by Alan Townsend on July 1, but remains a member of the Nicholas School faculty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.newsobserver.com/2014/05/14/3861285/duke-university-names-new-dean.html | title=Duke University names new dean of environmental studies | work=News &amp; Observer | date=14 May 2014 | accessdate=17 June 2014 | author=Murawski, John}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education and scientific career==
Chameides, a native of New York City, originally wanted to be a lawyer at the time he went to college.&lt;ref name=Nature/&gt;  However, he later changed his major, first to physics and then to atmospheric science, as a result of taking an undergraduate physics course.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.bizjournals.com/triangle/stories/2008/06/16/focus1.html?page=all | title=Bill Chameides, Duke University | work=[[Triangle Business Journal]] | date=16 June 2008 | accessdate=2 February 2014 | author=Saraiva, Catarina}}&lt;/ref&gt; He received a bachelor's degree from [[Binghamton University]] in 1970, a [[Master of philosophy]] degree from [[Yale University]] in 1973, and a PhD in 1974, also from Yale.&lt;ref name=Duke&gt;{{cite web | url=http://fds.duke.edu/db/Nicholas/faculty/wlc4 | title=William L. Chameides | work=[[Duke University]] | accessdate=2 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then began [[postdoctoral]] research at the [[University of Michigan]], where he conducted research with [[Ralph J. Cicerone]]. After completing this research, he spent 25 years at the [[Georgia Institute of Technology]], where he eventually became the chairman of the department of atmospheric sciences. While an associate professor there, he was the editor-in-chief of the [[Journal of Geophysical Research]] from 1985 to 1989,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Richman|first=Barbara T.|title=William L. Chameides: New JGR editor|journal=Eos, Transactions American Geophysical Union|volume=65|issue=17|pages=328|doi=10.1029/EO065i017p00328-01|bibcode=1984EOSTr..65..328R}}&lt;/ref&gt; and, five years later, was the lead author on a study in ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' which reported that [[ozone]] from [[photochemical smog]] may significantly reduce global food production. In the study, Chameides et al. wrote that about 60% of smog is produced in North America, Europe, China, and Japan, which also produce about 60% of the global food supply.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

Chameides said he made this decision because he wanted to "...do more to advance the cause of good environmental stewardship."&lt;ref name=Nature/&gt; In 2011, Chameides was the vice-chair of a report issued by the [[United States National Research Council]] entitled "America's Climate Choices."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=12781&amp;page=93 | title=America's Climate Choices: Appendix A | publisher=[[National Academies Press]] | year=2011 | pages=93 | isbn=978-0-309-14585-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://content.usatoday.com/communities/sciencefair/post/2011/05/climate-change-global-warming-action-national-research-council-report/1#.Uu6HoHddWUA | title=Risky business: Report says act now to combat climate change | work=[[USA Today]] | date=13 May 2011 | accessdate=2 February 2014 | author=Rice, Doyle}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Public advocacy==
Chameides has been active in highlighting the dangers of [[global warming]], and has testified before the [[U.S. House of Representatives]]' Committee on Science, Space and Technology on the matter. In his testimony, delivered on April 25, 2013, he said that global warming is occurring, is primarily caused by human activity, and that it will have many negative effects on the United States, including, but not limited to, "more intense and frequent heat waves, risks to coastal communities from sea level rise, greater drying of the arid Southwest, and increased public health risks."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://docs.house.gov/meetings/SY/SY18/20130425/100766/HHRG-113-SY18-Wstate-ChameidesW-20130425.pdf | title=Hearing on Policy-Relevant Climate Issues in Context | date=25 April 2013 | accessdate=2 February 2014 | author=Chameides, William L.}}&lt;/ref&gt; He currently runs a blog on the Nicholas School of the Environment website called "The Green Grok,"&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.nicholas.duke.edu/thegreengrok/ The Green Grok]&lt;/ref&gt; and has also blogged about global warming and other environmental issues on the [[Huffington Post]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/bill-chameides/ | title=Bill Chameides | work=[[Huffington Post]] | accessdate=2 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and for [[Popular Science]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.popsci.com/category/tags/bill-chameides | title=Posts Tagged: Bill Chameides | work=[[Popular Science]] | accessdate=2 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chameides has also written about the [[economics of climate change mitigation]] for both ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1126/science.1138299| title = CLIMATE CHANGE: Carbon Trading over Taxes| year = 2007| last1 = Chameides | first1 = W.| last2 = Oppenheimer | first2 = M.| journal = Science| volume = 315| issue = 5819| pages = 1670 | pmid=17379793}}&lt;/ref&gt; and for [[The Guardian]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2009/oct/15/carbon-emission-convergence-principle | title=A fairer formula for emissions targets | work=[[The Guardian]] | date=15 October 2009 | accessdate=2 February 2014 |author1=Kasibhatla, Prasad |author2=Chameides, Bill }}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, after [[Joe Bastardi]] claimed on [[Fox News Channel]] that carbon dioxide can't cause global warming because of the [[first law of thermodynamics]] and [[Le Chatelier's principle]], [[Media Matters for America]] contacted Chameides by email, who referred to Bastardi's claims as "utter nonsense."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://mediamatters.org/blog/2011/08/09/a-fox-news-science-lesson/185961 | title=A Fox News Science Lesson | work=[[Media Matters for America]] | date=9 August 2011 | accessdate=2 February 2014 | author=Fong, Jocelyn}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has also, along with [[Alan Leshner]], criticized the North Carolina government's proposal of a law in response to a report stating that sea levels were projected to rise about 39 inches over the next century. In an article for the News &amp; Observer, they accused the law's supporters of trying to "disregard projections of sea level rise" and trying to "outlaw climate change."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.newsobserver.com/2012/08/01/2234915/nc-cant-outlaw-global-climate.html | title=N.C. can't outlaw global climate change | work=[[The News &amp; Observer]] | date=1 August 2012 | accessdate=2 February 2014 |author1=Chameides, William |author2=Leshner, Alan }}&lt;/ref&gt; The law, which would prevent the government from using sea-level data based on anything except "historical data" for the next four years, was passed despite Chameides' objections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://abcnews.go.com/US/north-carolina-bans-latest-science-rising-sea-level/story?id=16913782 | title=New Law in North Carolina Bans Latest Scientific Predictions of Sea-Level Rise | work=[[ABC News]] | date=2 August 2012 | accessdate=2 February 2014 | author=Harish, Alon}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has also criticized the [[cash for clunkers]] program by pointing out that, while one of its goals is to decrease CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions by promoting the purchase of more fuel-efficient cars, manufacturing new cars results in the production of carbon dioxide—he puts the figure at between 3 and 12 tons per car. He has also calculated that trading in a clunker that gets 18 mpg for a new car that gets 22 mpg would necessitate 5 and a half years of typical driving to offset the car's carbon footprint.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=111511131 | title=Critics Say 'Clunkers' Program Isn't Very Green | work=[[NPR]] | date=3 August 2009 | accessdate=3 February 2014 | author=Joyce, Christopher}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chameides has also written about other environmental issues, like chemicals used in certain consumer products. For example, when interviewed by the [[Taipei Times]] about the safety of [[optical brightener]]s in laundry detergent, he said that scientific studies on the topic have been "inconclusive."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/editorials/archives/2011/01/04/2003492616/2 | title=Going green while pursuing whiter whites | work=[[Taipei Times]] | date=4 January 2011 | accessdate=2 February 2014 | author=Newman, Andrew Adam}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''wind profiler''' is a type of weather observing equipment that uses [[radar]] or sound waves ([[SODAR]]) to detect the [[wind]] [[wind speed|speed]] and [[wind direction|direction]] at various elevations above the ground. Readings are made at each kilometer above sea level, up to the extent of the troposphere (i.e., between 8 and 17&amp;nbsp;km above mean sea level). Above this level there is inadequate water vapor present to produce a radar "bounce." The data synthesized from wind direction and speed is very useful to meteorological forecasting and timely reporting for flight planning. A twelve-hour history of data is available through [[NOAA]] websites.

==Principle==
[[File:radar-Profileur.png|left|thumb|Orientation of the beams in the case of a three tilted wind profiler]]
In a typical implementation, the radar or sodar can sample along each of five beams: one is aimed vertically to measure vertical velocity, and four are tilted off vertical and oriented orthogonal to one another to measure the horizontal components of the air's motion. A profiler's ability to measure winds is based on the assumption that the turbulent eddies that induce scattering are carried along by the mean wind. The energy scattered by these eddies and received by the profiler is [[orders of magnitude]] smaller than the energy transmitted. However, if sufficient samples can be obtained, then the amplitude of the energy scattered by these eddies can be clearly identified above the background noise level, then the mean wind speed and direction within the volume being sampled can be determined. The radial components measured by the tilted beams are the vector sum of the horizontal motion of the air toward or away from the radar and any vertical motion present in the beam. Using appropriate trigonometry, the three-dimensional meteorological velocity components (u,v,w) and wind speed and wind direction are calculated from the radial velocities with corrections for vertical motions.

==Radar wind profiler==

[[File:Horizontal velocities of a wind profiler.gif|thumb|Horizontal [[Station model#Plotted winds|plotted wind]] from a profiler.]]
[[File:Reflectivities on a wind profiler.gif|thumb|Reflectivity data obtained as a byproduct on a typical radar wind profiler.]]
[[Pulse-Doppler radar]] wind profilers operate using electromagnetic (EM) signals to remotely sense winds aloft. The radar transmits an [[Electromagnetic radiation|electromagnetic]] pulse along each of the [[Antenna (radio)|antenna]]'s pointing directions. A UHF profiler includes subsystems to control the radar's transmitter, receiver, signal processing, and [[Radio Acoustic Sounding System]] (RASS), if provided, as well as data telemetry and remote control.

The duration of the transmission determines the length of the pulse emitted by the antenna, which in turn corresponds to the volume of air illuminated (in electrical terms) by the radar beam. Small amounts of the transmitted energy are scattered back (referred to as [[backscatter]]ing) toward and received by the radar. Delays of fixed intervals are built into the data processing system so that the radar receives scattered energy from discrete altitudes, referred to as range gates. The [[Doppler effect|Doppler frequency shift]] of the backscattered energy is determined, and then used to calculate the velocity
of the air toward or away from the radar along each beam as a function of altitude. The source of the backscattered energy (radar “targets”) is small-scale turbulent fluctuations that induce irregularities in the radio [[refractive index]] of the atmosphere. The radar is most sensitive to scattering by turbulent eddies whose spatial scale is ½ the wavelength of the radar, or approximately 16 centimeters (cm) for a UHF profiler.

A boundary-layer radar wind profiler can be configured to compute averaged wind profiles for periods ranging from a few minutes to an hour. Boundary-layer radar wind profilers are often configured to sample in more than one mode. For example, in a “low mode,” the pulse of energy transmitted by the profiler may be 60 m in length. The pulse length determines the depth of the column of air being sampled and thus the vertical resolution of the data. In a “high mode,” the pulse length is increased, usually to 100 m or greater. The longer pulse length means that more energy is being transmitted for each sample, which improves the [[signal-to-noise ratio]] (SNR) of the data. Using a longer pulse length increases the depth of the sample volume and thus decreases the vertical resolution in the data. The greater energy output of the high mode increases the maximum altitude to which the radar wind profiler can sample, but at the expense of coarser vertical resolution and an increase in the
altitude at which the first winds are measured. When radar wind profilers are operated in multiple modes, the data are often combined into a single overlapping data set to simplify postprocessing and data validation procedures.&lt;ref name=Bailey&gt;{{cite book

==Sodar wind profiler==
[[File:Sodar triton.jpg|right|thumb|The TRITON transportable [[SODAR]] system used to measure wind profiles from  [[Second Wind (company)|Second Wind]].]]
Alternatively, a wind profiler may use sound waves to measure wind speed at various heights above the ground, and the thermodynamic structure of the lower layer of the [[atmosphere]]. These [[sodar]]s can be divided in mono-static system using the same antenna for transmitting and receiving, and bi-static system using separate antennas. The difference between the two antenna systems determines whether atmospheric scattering is by temperature fluctuations (in mono-static systems), or by both temperature and wind velocity fluctuations (in bi-static systems).

Mono-static antenna systems can be divided further into two categories: those using multiple axis, individual antennas and those using a single [[phased array]] antenna. The multiple-axis systems generally use three individual antennas aimed in specific directions to steer the acoustic beam. One antenna is generally aimed vertically, and the other two are tilted slightly from the vertical at an orthogonal angle. Each of the individual antennas may use a single transducer focused into a [[parabolic reflector]] to form a [[parabolic loudspeaker]], or an array of [[speaker driver]]s and [[horn loudspeaker|horns]] ([[transducer]]s) all transmitting [[Phase (waves)|in-phase]] to form a single beam. Both the tilt angle from the vertical and the azimuth angle of each antenna are fixed when the system is set up.

The vertical range of sodars is approximately 0.2 to 2 kilometers (km) and is a function of frequency, power output, atmospheric stability, [[turbulence]], and, most importantly, the [[Noise pollution|noise environment]] in which a sodar is operated. Operating frequencies range from less than 1000&amp;nbsp;Hz to over 4000&amp;nbsp;Hz, with power levels up to several hundred watts. Due to the attenuation characteristics of the atmosphere, high power, lower frequency sodars will generally produce greater height coverage. Some sodars can be operated in different modes to better match vertical resolution and range to the application. This is accomplished through a relaxation between [[Pulse-width modulation|pulse length]] and maximum altitude.&lt;ref name=Bailey/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2945">The '''Yukon Interior dry forests''' is a [[taiga]] [[ecoregion]] of [[Canada]].

==Setting==
This ecoregion, which covers much of the southern [[Yukon]] and a very small portion of northwestern [[British Columbia]], is mainly located on the [[Yukon Plateau]], which  consists of rolling hills, plateaus and deeply cut, broad valleys. The area has a dry [[subarctic climate]], with summer temperatures averaging around {{convert|11|°C|°F}}, and winter temperatures averaging from {{convert|-16.5|°C|°F}} to {{convert|-19|°C|°F}}. Precipitation is low, averaging between 225–400&amp;nbsp;mm (8.9-15.7&amp;nbsp;in), with higher elevation areas and areas to the north-east receiving greater precipitation.&lt;ref&gt;{{WWF ecoregion|id=na0617|name=Yukon Interior dry forests}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Flora==
Black spruce (''[[Picea mariana]]'') and white spruce (''[[Picea glauca]]'') are the two most common trees, with [[lodgepole pine]] (''Pinus contorta'' subsp. ''latifolia'') being found in very dry or burnt sites. South-facing, low elevation slopes are often characterised by grassland communities. [[Dwarf birch]], [[willow]] and subalpine fir (''[[Abies lasiocarpa]]'') are found the [[subalpine zone]] below the [[tree line]], while the [[alpine zone]] above supports a sparse vegetative cover consisting of [[mountain avens]], dwarf [[shrub]]s, [[forb]]s, [[grass]]es and [[lichen]].

==Fauna==
Mammals of this ecoregion include [[Reindeer|caribou]] (''Rangifer tarandus''), [[moose]] (''Alces alces''), [[mountain goat]] (''Oreamnus americanus''), [[Dall sheep]] (''Ovis dalli''), [[grizzly bear]] (''Ursos arctos horriblus''), [[American black bear|black bear]] (''Ursus americanus''), [[gray wolf]] (''Canis lupus''), [[coyote]] (''Canis latrans''), [[North American Beaver|beaver]] (''Castor canadensis'') and [[hare]]. Avian species include the [[common raven]] (''Corvus corax''), [[rock ptarmigan|ptarmigan]] and [[golden eagle]] (''Aquila chryaetos'').

==Threats and preservation==
This ecoregion is well preserved, with an estimated 75% intact. Uplands are better preserved than valley bottoms, wherein most of the development in this ecoregion has taken place. There are no large protected areas in this ecoregion, but smaller areas are the Charlie Cole Creek Ecological Reserve and the Nisutlin River Delta National Wildlife Area. Timber harvesting, mining and a state-sponsored wolf kill are the greatest threats to the region's ecological integrity.
