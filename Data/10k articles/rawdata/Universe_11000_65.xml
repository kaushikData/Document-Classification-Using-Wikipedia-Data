The '''α-factor''' is used to predict the solid–liquid [[Interface (chemistry)|interface]] type of a material during [[Freezing|solidification]].

==Method==
According to John E. Gruzleski in his book Microstructure Development During Metalcasting (1996):

α = (L/k*T&lt;sub&gt;E&lt;/sub&gt;)*(η/v)

where 
L is [[latent heat of fusion]]
k is [[Boltzmann’s constant]]
T&lt;sub&gt;E&lt;/sub&gt; is equilibrium [[Freezing point|freezing temperature]]
η is the number of nearest neighbours an [[atom]] has in the interface [[Plane (geometry)|plane]]
v is the number of nearest neighbours in the bulk solid

Since L/T&lt;sub&gt;E&lt;/sub&gt; = ΔS&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;

where ΔS&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[molar concentration|molar]] [[entropy of fusion]] of the material

α = ΔS&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;/k(η/v)

According to Martin Glicksman in his book Principles of Solidification : An Introduction to Modern Casting and Crystal Growth Concepts(2011):

α = ΔS&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;/R&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;(η&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;/Z)

where R&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[universal gas constant]],
(η&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;/Z) is similar to previous, always 1/4&lt;(η&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;/Z)&lt;1

'''Aurora Energy''' is an electricity distribution company in Otago, New Zealand. Aurora Energy is owned by Dunedin City Holdings Limited on behalf of the Dunedin City Council.&lt;ref name="about"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.auroraenergy.co.nz/about/| title=About Aurora Energy| publisher=Aurora Energy| accessdate=22 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aurora Energy is New Zealand's sixth largest electricity distributor. Over 85,000 premises in [[Dunedin]] and [[Central Otago]] receive power from Aurora Energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.auroraenergy.co.nz/| publisher=Aurora Energy| title=General Info}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Distribution network==
Aurora Energy's distribution network is supplied from [[Transpower New Zealand|Transpower]]'s national grid at five grid exit points (GXPs): [[Halfway Bush]] and [[South Dunedin]] for the Dunedin network, and [[Clyde Dam|Clyde]], [[Cromwell, New Zealand|Cromwell]] and [[Frankton, Otago|Frankton]] for the Central Otago network. Most of the network's subtransmission is at 33,000 volts with the major exception of the lines feeding [[Wanaka]] from Cromwell GXP, which operate at 66,000 volts. Distribution is at 6600&amp;nbsp;volts in the Dunedin urban area and the Clyde area, and at 11,000 volts elsewhere.

[[Image:Decorative Soaps.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Soap]]s are weak bases formed by the reaction of [[fatty acids]] with [[sodium hydroxide]] or [[potassium hydroxide]].]]
{{Acids and bases}}

In [[chemistry]],  '''bases''' are substances that, in [[aqueous solution]], release [[hydroxide]] (OH&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;) ions, are slippery to the touch, can taste [[Taste#bitter|bitter]] if an alkali,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Investigating chemistry: a forensic science perspective|last=Johll|first=Matthew E.|date=2009|publisher=W. H. Freeman and Co|isbn=1429209895|edition=2nd|location=New York |oclc=392223218}}&lt;/ref&gt; change the color of indicators (e.g., turn red [[litmus paper]] blue), react with [[acid]]s to form [[salts]], promote certain chemical reactions ([[base catalysis]]), accept [[proton]]s from any proton donor or contain completely or partially displaceable OH&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; [[ions]]. Examples of bases are the hydroxides of the [[alkali metal]]s and the [[alkaline earth metal]]s ([[sodium hydroxide|NaOH]], [[calcium hydroxide|Ca(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]], etc., see [[alkali hydroxide]] and alkaline earth hydroxide).

These particular substances produce [[hydroxide]] ions (OH&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;) in aqueous solutions, and are thus classified as [[Arrhenius base]]s. 
For a substance to be classified as an Arrhenius base, it must produce hydroxide ions in an aqueous solution. [[Svante_Arrhenius|Arrhenius]] believed that in order to do so, the base must contain hydroxide in the formula. This makes the Arrhenius model limited, as it cannot explain the basic properties of aqueous solutions of [[ammonia]] (NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) or its organic derivatives ([[amine]]s).{{sfnp|Whitten et al.|2009|page=363}} There are also bases that do not contain a hydroxide ion but nevertheless react with water, resulting in an increase in the concentration of the hydroxide ion.{{sfnp|Zumdahl|DeCoste|2013|page=257}} An example of this is the reaction between ammonia and water to produce ammonium and hydroxide.{{sfnp|Zumdahl|DeCoste|2013|page=257}} In this reaction ammonia is the base because it accepts a proton from the water molecule.{{sfnp|Zumdahl|DeCoste|2013|page=257}} Ammonia and other bases similar to it usually have the ability to form a bond with a proton due to the unshared pair of electrons that they possess.{{sfnp|Zumdahl|DeCoste|2013|page=257}} In the more general [[Brønsted–Lowry acid–base theory]], a base is a substance that can accept [[hydron (chemistry)|hydrogen cation]]s (H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;)—otherwise known as [[proton]]s. In the [[Lewis acids and bases|Lewis model]], a base is an [[electron pair]] donor.{{sfnp|Whitten et al.|2009|page=349}}

In water, by altering the [[self-ionization of water|autoionization]] [[Chemical equilibrium|equilibrium]], bases yield solutions in which the hydrogen ion [[Activity (chemistry)|activity]] is lower than it is in pure water, i.e., the water has a [[pH]] higher than 7.0 at standard conditions. A soluble base is called an '''[[alkali]]''' if it contains and releases OH&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; ions [[Stoichiometry|quantitatively]]. However, it is important to realize that basicity is not the same as [[alkalinity]]. Metal [[oxide]]s, hydroxides, and especially [[alkoxide]]s are basic, and counteranions of [[acid strength|weak acid]]s are weak bases.

Bases can be thought of as the chemical opposite of [[acid]]s. However, some strong acids are able to act as bases.&lt;ref name=Gilbert /&gt; Bases and acids are seen as opposites because the effect of an acid is to increase the [[hydronium]] (H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) concentration in water, whereas bases reduce this concentration. A reaction between an acid and base is called [[Neutralization (chemistry)|neutralization]]. In a neutralization reaction, an aqueous solution of a base reacts with an aqueous solution of an acid to produce a solution of [[water]] and [[salt (chemistry)|salt]] in which the salt separates into its component ions. If the aqueous solution is [[saturated solution|saturated]] with a given salt [[Solvent|solute]], any additional such salt [[precipitate]]s out of the solution.

The notion of a base as a concept in chemistry was first introduced by the French chemist [[Guillaume François Rouelle]] in 1754. He noted that acids, which at that time were mostly volatile liquids (like [[acetic acid]]), turned into solid salts only when combined with specific substances. Rouelle considered that such a substance serves as a "base" for the salt, giving the salt a "concrete or solid form".&lt;ref name="Jensen"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Jensen, William B. |title=The origin of the term "base" |journal=The Journal of Chemical Education |year=2006 |volume=83 |page=1130 |url=http://www.che.uc.edu/Jensen/W.%20B.%20Jensen/Reprints/129.%20Base.pdf |issue=8 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304023719/http://www.che.uc.edu/Jensen/W.%20B.%20Jensen/Reprints/129.%20Base.pdf |archivedate=4 March 2016 |df=dmy |bibcode=2006JChEd..83.1130J |doi=10.1021/ed083p1130 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Properties==
General properties of bases include:

*Concentrated or strong bases are [[Causticity|caustic]] on organic matter and react violently with acidic substances.
*Aqueous solutions or molten bases dissociate in ions and conduct electricity.
*Reactions with [[PH indicator|indicators]]: bases turn red litmus paper blue, phenolphthalein pink, keep bromothymol blue in its natural colour of blue, and turn methyl orange yellow.
*The [[pH]] of a basic solution at standard conditions is greater than seven.
*Bases are bitter in taste.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/base|title=Definition of BASE|author=|date=|website=www.merriam-webster.com|accessdate=3 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180321215707/https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/base|archivedate=21 March 2018|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reactions between bases and water ==
The following reaction represents the general reaction between a base (B) and water to produce a conjugate acid (BH&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) and a conjugate base (OH&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;):{{sfnp|Zumdahl|DeCoste|2013|page=257}}

: B&lt;sub&gt;(aq)&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;(''l'')&lt;/sub&gt; ⇌ BH&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;(aq)&lt;/sub&gt; + OH&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;(aq)&lt;/sub&gt;

The equilibrium constant, K&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;, for this reaction can be found using the following general equation:{{sfnp|Zumdahl|DeCoste|2013|page=257}}

: K&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt; = [BH&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;][OH&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;]/[B]

In this equation, both the base (B) and the extremely strong base (the conjugate base) compete with one another for the proton.{{sfnp|Zumdahl|DeCoste|2013|page=258}} As a result, bases that react with water have relatively small equilibrium constant values.{{sfnp|Zumdahl|DeCoste|2013|page=258}} The base is weaker when it has a lower equilibrium constant value.{{sfnp|Zumdahl|DeCoste|2013|page=257}}

==Neutralization of acids==
[[Image:Hydrochloric acid ammonia.jpg|thumb|[[Ammonia]] fumes from aqueous [[ammonium hydroxide]] (in test tube) reacting with [[hydrochloric acid]] (in [[beaker (glassware)|beaker]]) to produce [[ammonium chloride]] (white smoke).]]
Bases react with acids to neutralize each other at a fast rate both in water and in alcohol.&lt;ref name=Gilbert /&gt; When dissolved in water, the strong base [[sodium hydroxide]] ionizes into hydroxide and sodium ions:

:NaOH → {{chem|Na|+}} + {{chem|OH|-}}

and similarly, in water the acid [[hydrogen chloride]] forms hydronium and chloride ions:

:HCl + {{chem|H|2|O}} → {{chem|H|3|O|+}} + {{chem|Cl|-}}

When the two solutions are mixed, the {{chem|H|3|O|+}} and {{chem|OH|-}} ions combine to form water molecules:

:{{chem|H|3|O|+}} + {{chem|OH|-}} → 2 {{chem|H|2|O}}

If equal quantities of NaOH and HCl are dissolved, the base and the acid neutralize exactly, leaving only NaCl, effectively [[table salt]], in solution.

Weak bases, such as baking soda or egg white, should be used to neutralize any acid spills. Neutralizing acid spills with strong bases, such as [[sodium hydroxide]] or [[potassium hydroxide]], can cause a violent exothermic reaction, and the base itself can cause just as much damage as the original acid spill.

==Alkalinity of non-hydroxides==
Bases are generally compounds that can neutralize an amount of acids. Both [[sodium carbonate]] and [[ammonia]] are bases, although neither of these substances contains {{chem|OH|-}} groups. Both compounds accept H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; when dissolved in [[protic solvent]]s such as water:

:Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O → 2 Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + HCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; + OH&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;
:NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O → NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + OH&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;

From this, a pH, or acidity, can be calculated for aqueous solutions of bases. Bases also directly act as electron-pair donors themselves:

:CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt; + H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; → HCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;
:NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; → NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;

A base is also defined as a molecule that has the ability to accept an electron pair bond by entering another atom's valence shell through its possession of one electron pair.&lt;ref name=Gilbert&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lewis|first1=Gilbert N.|author-link=Gilbert N. Lewis|title=Acids and Bases|volume=226|issue=3|year=1938|pages=293–313|journal=Journal of the Franklin Institute|url=http://ac.els-cdn.com/S0016003238916916/1-s2.0-S0016003238916916-main.pdf?_tid=1106e53c-b7d8-11e4-8ede-00000aacb362&amp;acdnat=1424310115_965ba8ac7059a46dc9c1037ac3deb536|accessdate=19 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are a limited number of elements that have atoms with the ability to provide a molecule with basic properties.&lt;ref name=Gilbert /&gt; [[Carbon]] can act as a base as well as [[nitrogen]] and [[oxygen]]. Fluorine and sometimes rare gases possess this ability as well.&lt;ref name=Gilbert /&gt; This occurs typically in compounds such as [[N-Butyllithium|butyl lithium]], [[alkoxide]]s, and metal [[amide]]s such as [[sodium amide]]. Bases of carbon, nitrogen and oxygen without [[resonance (chemistry)|resonance]] stabilization are usually very strong, or [[superbase]]s, which cannot exist in a water solution due to the acidity of water. Resonance stabilization, however, enables weaker bases such as carboxylates; for example, [[sodium acetate]] is a [[weak base]].

==Strong bases==
A strong base is a basic chemical compound that can remove a proton (H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) from (or ''[[deprotonate]]'') a molecule of even a very weak acid (such as water) in an acid-base reaction. Common examples of strong bases include hydroxides of alkali metals and alkaline earth metals, like NaOH and {{chem|Ca(OH)|2}}, respectively. Due to their low solubility, some bases, such as alkaline earth hydroxides, can be used when the solubility factor is not taken into account.{{sfnp|Zumdahl|DeCoste|2013|page=255}} One advantage of this low solubility is that "many antacids were suspensions of metal hydroxides such as aluminum hydroxide and magnesium hydroxide."{{sfnp|Zumdahl|DeCoste|2013|page=256}} These compounds have low solubility and have the ability to stop an increase in the concentration of the hydroxide ion, preventing the harm of the tissues in the mouth, oesophagus, and stomach.{{sfnp|Zumdahl|DeCoste|2013|page=256}} As the reaction continues and the salts dissolve, the stomach acid reacts with the hydroxide produced by the suspensions.{{sfnp|Zumdahl|DeCoste|2013|page=256}} Strong bases hydrolyze in water almost completely, resulting in the [[leveling effect]]."&lt;ref name=Gilbert /&gt; In this process, the water molecule combines with a strong base, due to the water's amphoteric ability; and, a hydroxide ion is released.&lt;ref name=Gilbert /&gt; Very strong bases can even deprotonate very weakly acidic C–H groups in the absence of water. Here is a list of several strong bases:

*[[Lithium hydroxide]] (LiOH)
*[[Sodium hydroxide]] (NaOH)
*[[Potassium hydroxide]] (KOH)
*[[Rubidium hydroxide]] (RbOH)
*[[Cesium hydroxide]] (CsOH)
*[[Magnesium hydroxide]] ({{chem|Mg(OH)|2}}; in solution; but the solid has only limited solubility and thus is weakly basic)
*[[Calcium hydroxide]] ({{chem|Ca(OH)|2}})
*[[Strontium hydroxide]] ({{chem|Sr(OH)|2}})
*[[Barium hydroxide]] ({{chem|Ba(OH)|2}})

The cations of these strong bases appear in the first and second groups of the periodic table (alkali and earth alkali metals).

Acids with a p''K&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;'' of more than about 13 are considered very weak, and their [[conjugate base]]s are strong bases.

===Superbases===
{{Main|Superbase}}
Group 1 salts of carbanions, amides, and hydrides tend to be even stronger bases due to the extreme weakness of their conjugate acids, which are stable hydrocarbons, amines, and dihydrogen. Usually these bases are created by adding pure alkali metals such as sodium into the conjugate acid. They are called ''[[superbase]]s'', and it is impossible to keep them in water solution because they are stronger bases than the hydroxide ion. As such, they deprotonate the conjugate acid water.  For example, the ethoxide ion (conjugate base of ethanol) in the presence of water undergoes this reaction.

:{{chem|CH|3|CH|2|O|-}} + {{chem|H|2|O}} → {{chem|CH|3|CH|2|OH}} + {{chem|OH|-}}

Examples of superbases are:

*[[Ortho-diethynylbenzene dianion]] (C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt; (This is the strongest Superbase ever synthesized)  
*[[Meta-diethynylbenzene dianion]] (C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt;  (This is the second strongest Superbase, this is an isomer of Ortho-diethynylbenzene dianion)
*[[Para-diethynylbenzene dianion]] (C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt;  (This is the third strongest Superbase, this is also an isomer of Ortho-diethynylbenzene dianion)
*[[Lithium monoxide anion]] (LiO&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;) (This is the fourth strongest Superbase)
*[[n-Butyllithium|Butyl lithium]] (n-C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;Li)
*[[Lithium diisopropylamide]] (LDA)  [(CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;NLi 
*[[Lithium diethylamide]] (LDEA)  {{chem|(C|2|H|5|)|2|NLi}}
*[[Sodium amide]] (NaNH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)
*[[Sodium hydride]] (NaH)
*[[Lithium bis(trimethylsilyl)amide]] {{chem|[(CH|3|)|3|Si]|2|NLi}}

== Neutral bases ==
When a neutral base forms a bond with a neutral acid, a condition of electric stress occurs.&lt;ref name=Gilbert /&gt; The acid and the base share the electron pair that formerly only belonged to the base.&lt;ref name=Gilbert /&gt; As a result, a high dipole moment is created, which can only be destroyed by rearranging the molecules.&lt;ref name=Gilbert /&gt;

== Weak bases ==
{{main|weak base}}
A weak base is one which does not fully ionize in an [[aqueous solution]], or in which [[protonation]] is incomplete.

== Solid bases ==
Examples of solid bases include:
* Oxide mixtures: SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;; MgO, SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;; CaO, SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;ref name=Tanabe&gt;{{cite book|last1=Tanabe|first1=Kozo|title=Solid Acids and Bases: their catalytic properties |publisher=Academic Press |year=1970 |page=2 |url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=tFfBYuHg4vAC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PP1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |accessdate=19 February 2015 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Mounted bases: LiCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; on silica; NR&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, KNH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; on alumina; NaOH, KOH mounted on silica on alumina&lt;ref name="Tanabe"/&gt;
* Inorganic chemicals: BaO, KNaCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, BeO, MgO, CaO, KCN&lt;ref name="Tanabe"/&gt;
* Anion exchange resins&lt;ref name="Tanabe"/&gt;
*Charcoal that has been treated at 900 degrees Celsius or activates with N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, ZnCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;Cl-CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;ref name="Tanabe"/&gt;

Depending on a solid surface's ability to successfully form a conjugate base by absorbing an electrically neutral acid, the basic strength of the surface is determined.&lt;ref name="books.google.com"/&gt; "The number of basic sites per unit surface area of the solid" is used to express how much base is found on a solid base catalyst.&lt;ref name="books.google.com"/&gt; Scientists have developed two methods to measure the amount of basic sites: titration with benzoic acid using indicators and gaseous acid adsorption.&lt;ref name="books.google.com"/&gt; A solid with enough basic strength will absorb an electrically neutral acid indicator and cause the acid indicator's color to change to the color of its conjugate base.&lt;ref name="books.google.com"/&gt; When performing the gaseous acid adsorption method, nitric oxide is used.&lt;ref name="books.google.com"/&gt; The basic sites are then determined using the amount of carbon dioxide than is absorbed.&lt;ref name="books.google.com"/&gt;

==Bases as catalysts==
Basic substances can be used as [[solubility|insoluble]] heterogeneous [[catalyst]]s for [[chemical reaction]]s. Some examples are metal oxides such as [[magnesium oxide]], [[calcium oxide]], and [[barium oxide]] as well as [[potassium fluoride on alumina]] and some [[zeolite]]s. Many [[transition metal]]s make good catalysts, many of which form basic substances. Basic catalysts have been used for [[hydrogenation]]s, the migration of [[double bond]]s, in the [[Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley reduction]], the [[Michael reaction]], and many other reactions. Both CaO and BaO can be highly active catalysts if they are treated with high temperature heat.&lt;ref name="books.google.com"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Tanabe |first1=K. |last2=Misono |first2=M. |last3=Ono |first3=Y. |last4=Hattori |first4=H. |title=New Solid Acids and Bases: their catalytic properties |publisher=Elsevier |year=1990 |page=14 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Aq9cdug9hM0C&amp;pg=PA14 |accessdate=19 February 2015 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses of bases==
*Sodium hydroxide is used in manufacture of soap, paper and the  synthetic fiber [[rayon]].
*Calcium hydroxide (slaked lime) is used in the manufacture of bleaching powder.
*Calcium hydroxide is also used to clean the sulfur dioxide, which is caused by exhaust, that is found in power plants and factories.{{sfnp|Zumdahl|DeCoste|2013|page=256}}
*Magnesium hydroxide is used as an 'antacid' to neutralize excess acid in the stomach and cure indigestion.
*Sodium carbonate is used as washing soda and for softening hard water.
*Sodium hydrogen carbonate is used as baking soda in cooking food, for making baking powders, as an antacid to cure indigestion and in soda acid fire extinguisher.
*Ammonium hydroxide is used to remove grease stains from clothes

== Acidity of bases ==
The number of [[ionizable]] [[hydroxide]] (OH-) ions present in one molecule of base is called the acidity of bases.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.citycollegiate.com/acidbasesalt4.htm |title=Electrophile - Nucleophile - Basicity - Acidity - pH Scale |website=City Collegiate |access-date=2016-06-20 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160630222902/http://www.citycollegiate.com/acidbasesalt4.htm |archivedate=2010-06-30 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the basis of acidity bases can be classified into three types: monoacidic, diacidic and triacidic.

=== Monoacidic bases ===
[[File:Sodium hydroxide image .jpg|thumb|[[Sodium hydroxide]]]]
When one molecule of a base via complete [[ionization]] produces one [[hydroxide]] ion, the base is said to be a monoacidic base. Examples of monoacidic bases are:

[[Sodium hydroxide]], [[potassium hydroxide]], [[silver hydroxide]], [[ammonium hydroxide]], etc.

=== Diacidic bases ===
When one molecule of base via complete [[ionization]] produces two [[hydroxide]] ions, the base is said to be diacidic. Examples of diacidic bases are:
[[File:BARIUM HYDROXIDE IMAGE.jpg|thumb|[[Barium hydroxide]]]]
[[Barium hydroxide]], [[magnesium hydroxide]], [[calcium hydroxide]], [[zinc hydroxide]], [[iron(II) hydroxide]], [[tin(II) hydroxide]], [[lead(II) hydroxide]], [[copper(II) hydroxide]], etc.

=== Triacidic bases ===
When one molecule of base via complete [[ionization]] produces three [[hydroxide]] ions, the base is said to be triacidic. Examples of triacidic bases are:

[[Aluminium hydroxide]], [[ferrous hydroxide]], [[Hydroxide|Gold Trihydroxide,]]

==Etymology of the term==
The concept of base stems from an older [[Alchemy|alchemical]] notion of "the matrix":
{{Quote|The term "base" appears to have been first used in 1717 by the French chemist, [[Louis Lémery]], as a synonym for the older [[Paracelsus|Paracelsian]] term "matrix." In keeping with 16th-century [[animism]], Paracelsus had postulated that naturally occurring salts grew within the earth as a result of a universal acid or seminal principle having impregnated an earthy matrix or womb. ... Its modern meaning and general introduction into the chemical vocabulary, however, is usually attributed to the French chemist, [[Guillaume-François Rouelle]]. ... Rouelle explicitly defined a neutral salt as the product formed by the union of an acid with any substance, be it a water-soluble alkali, a volatile alkali, an absorbent earth, a metal, or an oil, capable of serving as "a base" for the salt "by giving it a concrete or solid form." Most acids known in the 18th century were volatile liquids or "spirits" capable of distillation, whereas salts, by their very nature, were crystalline solids. Hence it was the substance that neutralized the acid which supposedly destroyed the volatility or spirit of the acid and which imparted the property of solidity (i.e., gave a concrete base) to the resulting salt. |William Jensen|The origin of the term "base"&lt;ref name="Jensen"/&gt;}}

Dr. '''Bernard S. Baker''' (June 26, 1936 – June 21, 2004) &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2004/06/23/us/bernard-s-baker-67-a-pioneer-in-the-development-of-fuel-cells.html?sec=technology&amp;pagewanted=print%2F Bernard S. Baker, 67, a Pioneer In the Development of Fuel Cells - New York Times&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; was born in [[Philadelphia]] and a resident of [[Bethel, Connecticut]] in the United States. He was a pioneer in the field of electrochemistry and his career spanned 45 years. He was a founder and served as president, chief executive officer and chairman of Energy Research Corporation (now called FuelCell Energy, Inc.,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.FuelCellEnergy.com/ FuelCell Energy&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; in Danbury, Connecticut), developer and manufacturer of direct fuel cells ([[Molten carbonate fuel cell|MCFC]]) used to generate electric power. Power plants based on his concepts are providing electricity in [[distributed generation]] locations throughout the world.

Baker was known worldwide as an expert in electrochemical systems. He directed research in and development of various electrochemical power generation devices, including different types of [[fuel cells]], [[Battery (electricity)|batteries]] and hybrid systems. Baker's expertise encompassed fundamental research as well as the technological, engineering, system and marketing aspects of these systems, including "direct fuel cells", which can process hydrocarbon fuels such as natural gas without an external reformer.

Baker received his bachelor's and master's degrees in chemical engineering from the [[University of Pennsylvania]] and was a post-graduate [[Fulbright scholar|Fulbright fellow]] at the Laboratory for Electrochemistry of the [[University of Amsterdam]], before earning a doctorate from the [[Illinois Institute of Technology]] in 1969. His doctoral thesis was also on fuel cell heat transfer and internal reforming.

Before joining Energy Research Corporation, Baker was director of basic sciences at the Institute of Gas Technology in Chicago, where he directed research in the area of energy conversion and fuel cells. Before that, he was senior scientist at [[Lockheed Aircraft Corporation]], Missiles &amp; Space Division, where he was responsible for research on carbonate fuel cell systems and electrochemical kinetic studies.

Baker is a major contributor to the field of fuel cell research, development and commercialization. He was issued 20 U.S. patents relating to fuel cells and other electrochemical systems. He authored more than 100 publications, including technical papers, books and symposia proceedings on the subject of fuel cells.

In 1999, he received the [[William Robert Grove|Grove]] Medal, which was presented in conjunction with the Sixth Grove Fuel Cell Symposium &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.grovefuelcell.com 11th Grove Fuel Cell Symposium 2009&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; in London and is awarded to acknowledge an individual or company that has made valuable contributions toward the development and success of fuel cell technology.

At the time of the award, the chairman of the Grove Symposium Steering Committee said: "Dr. Bernard S. Baker devoted his entire professional career to develop and promote fuel cells. In the beginning as a scientist, finally as a top manager he dealt with various fuel cells including alkaline, phosphoric acid and molten carbonate technologies. Dr. Baker personifies a remarkable combination of scientific capabilities and management skills. This unique blend enabled him not only to have many patents on fuel cell related inventions and to issue more than 100 fuel cell publications but to build up one of the world wide leading companies in the carbonate fuel cell technology."

Baker received the Cecil J. Previdi Award for Entrepreneurial Spirit and Business Leadership in 1995. He was a Ralph E. Peck lecturer at the [[Illinois Institute of Technology]] in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iit.edu/engineering/chbe/about/history/peck_lecture.shtml Illinois Institute of Technology&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090713031159/http://www.iit.edu/engineering/chbe/about/history/peck_lecture.shtml |date=July 13, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''Blue Norther''', also known as a '''Texas Norther''', is a fast moving [[cold front]] in the plains area of the U.S. Midwest, marked by a sudden drop in temperature, heavy precipitation, and dark blue skies moving rapidly.  The phrase originated within Texas, where the land is very flat, perhaps making the approaching front seem darker and more threatening.    The cold front originates from the north, hence the "norther,". The interaction between the warm  causing cool temperatures and precipitation.&lt;ref name="tm8211"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Reid|first1=Jan|title=Texas Primer: The Blue Norther|url=https://www.texasmonthly.com/the-culture/texas-primer-the-blue-norther/|accessdate=29 November 2017|publisher=Texas Monthly|date=November 1982}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because the Midwest lies to the north of the [[Gulf of Mexico]] and to the east of the Rocky Mountains in the zone of the westerlies during the winter, temperatures can closely follow the sun, and highs that precede a Texas norther can, reach 85&amp;nbsp;°F in January and 90&amp;nbsp;°F under bright sunlight in nearly-calm conditions before the cold front passes through. Winds turn sharply from the north and become very strong. [[Windchill]] due to a combination of cold temperatures and strong winds is dangerous to anyone who is caught unaware and unprepared for it. It exists only from November to early March in Texas

This phenomenon is rare but is most common in November, when the last vestiges of fall are still clinging on. One of the most famous Blue Northers was the [[Great Blue Norther of November 11, 1911]], which spawned tornadoes and dropped temperatures 40 degrees in only 15 minutes and 67 degrees in 10 hours, a world record.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="49103">All across the world, colleges and universities are looking to a sustainable future by working to become carbon neutral. Universities are taking responsibility for their environmental impact and are working to neutralize those effects. To become carbon neutral, universities are working to reduce their emissions of greenhouse gases, cut their use of energy, use more renewable energy, and emphasize the importance of sustainable energy sources.&lt;ref name=Perazzoli/&gt; Universities that have committed to becoming carbon neutral have recognized the threat of global warming and are therefore committing to reverse the trend.&lt;ref name=Perazzoli/&gt;

==Definitions==
{{main article|Glossary of climate change}}
* [[Carbon neutral|Carbon Neutral]]: a term that recognizes all of the actions of a person, project or an institution that result in zero net carbon dioxide emissions. It can be achieved by increasing energy efficiency and improving energy conservation, as well as by using renewable energy.&lt;ref name="Frequently Asked Questions"/&gt;
* [[Carbon offset|Carbon Offset]]: an emission reduction credit from a project that results in less carbon dioxide or other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere than would otherwise occur. Carbon offsets are usually measured in tons of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and can be created by renewable energy projects, energy efficiency, and land use and agriculture based projects.&lt;ref name="FAQ"/&gt;
* [[Sustainable]]: a method of harvesting or using a resource so that the resource is not depleted or permanently damaged; of or relating to a lifestyle involving the use of sustainable methods .&lt;ref name="Sustainable-MW"/&gt;
* [[Carbon Footprint]]: a measure of the amount of carbon dioxide that is put into the atmosphere as a result of an individual's actions; driving, flying, home heating and cooling, as well as electricity use are some of the common activities that add to your carbon footprint.&lt;ref name="What is a carbon footprint?"/&gt;
* Carbon Calculator: measures an individual's or institution's impact on the climate by estimating how many tons of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases an individual's choices create each year. More than 90% of U.S. colleges and universities, and many outside the US, use the UNH [http://sustainableunh.unh.edu/calculator Campus Carbon Calculator]—the tool [https://web.archive.org/web/20161227223321/https://www.epa.gov/climatechange/what-you-can-do-school previously recommended by the U.S. EPA], the ACUPCC,&lt;ref name="www2.presidentsclimatecommitment.org"&gt;ACUPCC Implementation Guide v. 2.1, page 10; http://secondnature.org/wp-content/uploads/ACUPCCImplementationGuide_V2.1_.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; and others—to do their greenhouse gas inventories and climate action plans.&lt;ref name="Carbon Footprint Calculator"/&gt;
* [[Carbon Credit]]: a permit that allows the holder to emit one ton of carbon dioxide; credits are awarded to countries or groups that have reduced their greenhouse gases below their emission quota.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Agreements and organizations in the United States==

===Second Nature===
Second Nature is a nonprofit organization that works with higher education leaders to incorporate sustainability in with the foundation of curriculum and practice within colleges and universities.&lt;ref name="Second Nature"/&gt; Second Nature was among the first professional associations in sustainability, established in 1993 in Boston, Massachusetts.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kerr|first=Kathleen G.|last2=Hart-Steffes|first2=Jeanne S.|date=2012-03-01|title=Sustainability, student affairs, and students|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ss.20010/abstract|journal=New Directions for Student Services|language=en|volume=2012|issue=137|pages=7–17|doi=10.1002/ss.20010|issn=1536-0695}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the primary supporter for the [[American College and University Presidents' Climate Commitment]] (ACUPCC). Its involvement in ACUPCC includes coordinating cooperative action in developing a carbon offset protocol for universities, as well as coordinating outreach for new presidents to make the commitment to carbon neutrality.&lt;ref name="Second Nature"/&gt;

===The Association for the Advancement of Sustainability in Higher Education===
A partner with Second Nature, the Association for the Advancement of Sustainability in Higher Education (AASHE), was established in 2006 as the first professional higher education association for the campus sustainability community.&lt;ref name=AASHE/&gt; AASHE works with all sectors of a campus in integrating sustainability in with campus governance, education, and research.&lt;ref name=AASHE/&gt; Professional development is also emphasized through conferences, workshops, and networking.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Press releases, blogs, and awards are coordinated to promote carbon reduction and sustainable awareness. AASHE facilitates the reporting system for the ACUPCC, which documents all committed tangible actions and as well as greenhouse gas reports, climate action plans, and progress reports.

===American College and University Presidents' Climate Commitment===
{{Main|American College &amp; University Presidents' Climate Commitment}}

The American College and University Presidents' Climate Commitment (ACUPCC or PCC) is a project of Second Nature and AASHE.&lt;ref name="Mission and History pcc"/&gt; The organization consists of the text of an institutional commitment and the supporting informational and marketing materials surrounding the commitment.  The mission of the organization is to "provides a framework and support for America’s colleges and universities to implement comprehensive plans in pursuit of climate neutrality."&lt;ref name="Mission and History pcc"/&gt; The ACUPCC grew from concept to text during late 2006, and by March 2007 consisted of 157 signatories.&lt;ref name="Mission and History pcc"/&gt; The organization was officially unveiled in June 2007,&lt;ref name="Mission and History pcc"/&gt; and currently numbers 677 signatories.&lt;ref name="Signatory List pcc"/&gt;

====Summary of ACUPCC text====
The ACUPCC text can be summarized in two sections: the statement, and the plan. The statement is a four-paragraph declaration that outlines the scientific knowledge regarding global climate change that the signatories accept as fact. It goes on to describe the perceived or predicted institutional and social benefits of taking steps to reduce the emissions of greenhouse gases. The text proposes that by acting to limit their carbon footprint, universities and colleges can act as leader institutions in their communities, and similarly better serve their students and their educational needs. It concludes that, in accordance with the many resultant institutional benefits expected, leaders of educational institutions ought to commit to the steps outlined in the plan. The plan is a three-part outline of certain steps signatory institutions should take "in pursuit of climate neutrality." &lt;ref name="Text pcc"/&gt; The three parts of the plan involve developing a comprehensive plan, choosing from a menu of 'tangible actions' to initiate while developing a comprehensive plan, and issuing regular reports to AASHE regarding institutional progress. Comprehensive plan development under the ACUPCC follows three milestones. By the two-month milestone, signatories commit to having created formal institutional structures (and where appropriate, departments) for the express purpose of guiding the development of the plan as well as implementation of the other elements of the commitment. By the one-year milestone, signatories commit to having completed a greenhouse gas inventory, in accordance with the GHG protocol, with accordances in place to update the figures on a bi-yearly basis. The two-year milestone builds upon the greenhouse gas inventory, requiring that signatories create a comprehensive action plan for achieving climate neutrality. This action plan must include certain minimum elements: a target date for complete climate neutrality, intermediate institutional goals and target dates, steps to integrate climate neutrality and related concerns with educational curriculum and research, and institutional mechanisms for tracking intermediate goals above and beyond the specific structures outlined by the ACUPCC. The menu of possible actions includes conforming to [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design|LEED]] Silver standards or greater, purchasing [[Energy Star]] products, and encouraging and fostering use of public transportation. Finally, the reporting section of the three-part plan requires signatory institutions to make the details of their plans, inventories, and progress publicly available through AASHE. The final one-sentence paragraph of the text mentions the need to spread the knowledge contained in the commitment and recruit more signatories through institutional diplomacy.&lt;ref name="Text pcc"/&gt;

==== American University ====
In 2018, [[American University]] became the first university in the United States to reach carbon neutral status.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite press release |url=https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/carbon-neutrality-is-now-reality-at-american-university-300636317.html |title=Carbon Neutrality is Now Reality at American University |publisher=American University  |via=PR Newswire |access-date=April 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Cornell University====
[[Cornell University]] has signed the President's Climate Commitment and pledged that its Ithaca campus will have net zero carbon-based emissions by 2050.&lt;ref name="Cornell Climate Action Plan"/&gt;
Cornell has already completed a CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions inventory and estimated that its carbon footprint for the year 2008 was 319,000 metric tons of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-equivalent.&lt;ref name="Greenhouse Gas Inventory"/&gt;
Cornell has created 19 initiatives to help it achieve its goal of net zero emissions which consist of five main categories: green development, energy conservation, alternative transportation, using renewable energy to replace fossil fuels, and offsetting CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions.&lt;ref name="Achieving Net Zero Emissions"/&gt;
As part of its green development plan, Cornell wants “new buildings design[ed] to limit energy usage to 50 percent of the industry standard baseline.”&lt;ref name="Building Energy Standards"/&gt; In addition, Cornell is planning on converting some of its built land back into open space and decreasing the distance vehicles on campus need to travel.&lt;ref name="Improved Land Use"/&gt;
The energy conservation part of the plan includes switching to compact fluorescent light bulbs which would “reduce annual electrical usage for campus lighting by 25 percent."&lt;ref name="Building Energy Conservation"/&gt; The university also plans to reduce the amount of coal it uses by replacing its old steam line piping so that it is more efficient.&lt;ref name="Steam Line Upgrade"/&gt;
In order to achieve greener transportation, Cornell wants to reduce its employee use of single-occupant vehicles by 25 percent within 15 years.&lt;ref name="Commuter Travel"/&gt; It wants to achieve this goal by increasing bicycle and transit travel. Cornell also wants to reduce carbon emissions by having business meetings conducted via teleconferences instead of having employees travel for business.&lt;ref name="Business Travel"/&gt;
Cornell wants to increase its reliance on renewable energy so it can decrease its reliance on fossil fuels. Cornell wants to use wood to replace “10 percent of the coal burned in the two main Cornell solid fuel boilers.”&lt;ref name="Wood Cofiring"/&gt;
Cornell is planning to take steps to offset its carbon emissions in order to become net carbon neutral, but it views this measure as a last resort because it would rather focus on reducing the amount of carbon it produces.&lt;ref name="Offsetting Actions"/&gt; The university wants to contribute to afforestation by turning some of its unused cropland and pastures into forests that will absorb CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name="Offsetting Actions"/&gt; Cornell wants to turn {{convert|100|acre|km2}} per year into forest for the next 10 years, which it estimates to offset 3,800 metric tons of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; per year.&lt;ref name="Offsetting Actions"/&gt;  
Additionally, established at Cornell is the [[Atkinson Center for a Sustainable Future]], an organization focused on multidisciplinary research in energy issues, the environment and economic development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About ACSF|url=http://www.sustainablefuture.cornell.edu/about/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====University of Florida====
In October 2006, [[University of Florida]] President [[Bernard Machen]] became the first college president to sign the President's Climate Commitment.&lt;ref name="Neutral Gator"/&gt; By signing, the University of Florida committed to developing an action plan for carbon neutrality with the ultimate goal of becoming carbon neutral by 2025.&lt;ref name="Sustainable UF Initiatives"/&gt; In 2007, the University of Florida held the first carbon neutral [[college football]] game in [[NCAA]] history with the University of Florida versus Florida State  rivalry game. To accomplish this feat, scientists calculated the carbon footprint of the game."&lt;ref name="Neutral Gator"/&gt; They then offset the carbon emissions by working with foresters to set aside {{convert|18|acre|m2}} of rural North Florida land and then manage the land as a pine plantation forest for the next ten years.&lt;ref name="Hoover"/&gt; In 2008, the University of Florida partnered with the Neutral Gator Initiative to offset the carbon emissions from all of the home football games. In 2009, the University upped the standard and set out to offset the entire athletics program in order to have a carbon neutral athletics program.&lt;ref name="Gators Claim Title"/&gt;

=====Neutral Gator=====
The Neutral Gator Initiative was created by the organization Earth Givers along with the University of Florida  to educate game day fans about sustainability and carbon neutrality as well as to offset the carbon emissions of the University of Florida's entire athletic program.&lt;ref name="Gators Claim Title"/&gt; The goal of Neutral Gator is to help the University of Florida achieve its goal of becoming carbon neutral by 2025. Neutral Gator offsets the carbon emissions through various activities including compact fluorescent light bulb exchanges, weatherization efforts in low-income households, and local as well as regional natural area restoration projects.&lt;ref name="Our Projects"/&gt;

=====Climate action plan=====
After signing the President's Climate Commitment, the University of Florida was required to create a climate action plan detailing the steps the university will take to reach its goal of becoming carbon neutral by 2025. The plan focuses on the following:
{{quote|
# Foster organizational leadership and create a foundation for long-term institutional culture change in energy, water, and climate change mitigation and resource management.
## Treat energy flows and GHGE like dollars and track them with the same due diligence and transparency.
### Assess data concerns and direct relevant units to improve data collection at the original source.
### Expand the use of advanced metering infrastructure and enterprise building management systems.
### Create a plan to continuously improve energy consumption and GHGE data granularity from coarse, campus-wide detail to fine, building-scale and/or time interval detail.
## Integrate the CAP with the Vision for a Sustainable UF Implementation Plan.
## Coordinate the CAP with the Campus Master Plan.
## Refine and expand the use of methodologies and metrics to evaluate efficacy of energy efficiency and GHGE reduction strategies.
# Initiate, implement, and monitor the efficacy of key infrastructure energy efficiency strategies identified in the ongoing Energy Summits and outlined in the Office of Sustainability Vision and Implementation Plans.
# Continue and expand GHGE reduction campaigns via the Office of Sustainability Green Team Network and other outreach efforts with a focus on the conservation of electricity and water, the reduction of vehicle miles traveled, and utilizing the three R’s (reduce, reuse, recycle) of materials and waste.
# Evaluate, finance, and install a minimum of 100 kW of on-site renewable energy generating capacity within the main campus and/or its local environs.&lt;ref name="Climate Action Plan for the University of Florida"/&gt;}}

=== Clean Air-Cool Planet===
Clean Air-Cool Planet (CA-CP) was a Northeast-based nonprofit organization that was created in 2001. It partnered with colleges and universities (as well as other civil society institutions) to support their efforts toward carbon footprint reductions and ultimately, carbon neutrality.  Before the establishment of the ACUPCC, the presidents of a number of leading Northeast schools signed Memorandums of Understanding with CA-CP,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.antiochne.edu/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/ClimateActionPlan20102020.pdf|title=Attaining Climate Neutrality: Climate Action Plan 2010-2020|date=March 2010|website=antiochne.edu|publisher=Antioch New England University|access-date=2016-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; committing themselves to 1) conducting campus-wide greenhouse gas inventories; 2) setting reduction targets and timelines; 3) creating climate action plans; 4) implementing the carbon reduction measures contained in their plans;  and 5) communicating with their students, faculty, staff and community members to "institutionalize" a culture of sustainability on their campuses.  These schools, many of which became leading members of the [[American College and University Presidents Climate Commitment]] when it was established in 2006 and/or have driven innovation and demonstrated international leadership on the issue of climate change in other ways.

The CA-CP Campus Climate Action Toolkit — which included the CA-CP Campus Carbon Calculator developed by CA-CP in partnership with the University of NH — was made available to the public in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://sustainableunh.unh.edu/calculator|title=CCC Home|date=2014-06-18|newspaper=Sustainability Institute|access-date=2016-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Campus Carbon Calculator was downloaded by users at thousands of different institutions, which include not only colleges and universities but also hospitals, science centers, museums and aquaria, government agencies, k-12 schools and businesses, many of which are actively working toward campus carbon neutrality. More than 90% of U.S. colleges and universities, and many outside the US, use the calculator to do their greenhouse gas inventories&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aashe.org/blog/calculating-your-campus-carbon-footprint-it%E2%80%99s-not-hard-you-think]&lt;/ref&gt; and create climate action plans.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aashe.org/wiki/climate-planning-guide climate action plans&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Spirovski|first=D.|last2=Abazi|first2=A.|last3=Iljazi|first3=I.|last4=Ismaili|first4=M.|last5=Cassulo|first5=G.|last6=Venturin|first6=A.|date=2012-01-01|title=Realization of a Low Emission University Campus Through the Implementation of a Climate Action Plan|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877042812020575|journal=Procedia - Social and Behavioral Sciences|series=4th WORLD CONFERENCE ON EDUCATIONAL SCIENCES (WCES-2012) 02-05 February 2012 Barcelona, Spain|volume=46|pages=4695–4702|doi=10.1016/j.sbspro.2012.06.321}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, the University of New Hampshire's Sustainability Institute took over operations of Clean Air-Cool Planet.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.sightlines.com/clean-air-cool-planet-transitions-operations-to-university-of-new-hampshires-sustainability-institute/|title=Clean Air-Cool Planet Transitions Operations to University of New Hampshire and Sightlines - Sightlines|newspaper=Sightlines|language=en-US|access-date=2016-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The CA-CP Campus Carbon Calculator became a part of the Carbon Management and Analysis Platform, or CarbonMAP. CarbonMAP has many resources and tools to help organizations calculate and track their carbon use online.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://campuscarbon.com/|title=campuscarbon.com/|website=campuscarbon.com|access-date=2016-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the UNHSI Campus Carbon Calculator is still a widely used tool for calculating a campus' carbon footprint, it has received critiques. Some researchers believe that using carbon emissions as a single metric for campus climate change impact is outdated. They suggest that UNHSI would benefit from combining their carbon calculator with a nitrogen footprint calculator to most precisely estimate a campus' climate impact.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Allison|first=Leach,|last2=Jennifer|first2=Andrews,|date=2015-01-01|title=Calculating the Campus Nitrogen Footprint|url=http://scholarworks.umass.edu/necsc2015/10/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Campus leaders and student groups===
University and college leaders have taken action to reduce campus carbon emissions in the following ways: purchasing renewable energy credits, installing micro-wind turbines, retrocommissioning HVAC systems, install geothermal or solar hot water systems, building cogeneration electrical plants on campus, upgrading lighting on campus, establishing campus green teams, providing free public transportation for students, staff, and faculty, providing financial incentives for carpooling, implementing car-sharing and/or bike-sharing programs, and implementing campus shuttle services.&lt;ref name="The College Sustainability Report Card"/&gt; Student clubs and organizations are active in raising awareness in various aspects of carbon neutrality. Climate change, sustainability practice, natural resource conservation, clean energy, and environmental policy are common focuses of student groups working toward carbon neutrality.&lt;ref name="Groups Directory"/&gt;

===Sustainable Endowments Institute===
The [http://www.endowmentinstitute.org/ Sustainable Endowments Institute (SEI)] is a nonprofit organization created in 2005 that supports sustainable development for campus operation and endowment policy.&lt;ref name="The College Sustainability Report Card"/&gt; The SEI focuses its efforts on various climate change initiatives, such as the College Sustainability Report Card and the Billion Dollar Green Challenge Program.

==== Billion Dollar Green Challenge Program ====
The [http://greenbillion.org/ Billion Dollar Green Challenge Program] was started by the SEI and 15 other sustainability organizations to encourage colleges and universities to invest in green revolving funds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mero|first=Ted|date=2012-02-01|title=The Billion Dollar Green Challenge|url=http://online.liebertpub.com/doi/abs/10.1089/SUS.2012.9997|journal=Sustainability: The Journal of Record|volume=5|issue=1|pages=17–20|doi=10.1089/SUS.2012.9997|issn=1937-0695}}&lt;/ref&gt; The program requires that institutions involved collaborate and engage with other institutions in order to reach a collective $1 billion of investments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://eric.ed.gov/?id=ED539859|title=Green Revolving Funds: An Introductory Guide to Implementation &amp; Management|last=Indvik|first=Joe|last2=Foley|first2=Rob|last3=Orlowski|first3=Mark|publisher=Sustainable Endowments Institute|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The funds are then reinvested in green initiatives in participating campuses. As of 2016, 60 institutions are participating in the Billion Dollar Green Challenge and have committed $76 million toward green revolving funds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://greenbillion.org/participants/|title=Billion Dollar Green Challenge|website=greenbillion.org|access-date=2016-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.endowmentinstitute.org/our-initiatives/|title=Initiatives {{!}} Sustainable Endowments Institute|website=www.endowmentinstitute.org|access-date=2016-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====College Sustainability Report Card====
From 2007-2011, SEI released the College Sustainability Report Card, which identified the leading campus sustainability efforts in the US and Canada.&lt;ref name="The College Sustainability Report Card" /&gt; Three hundred thirty two campuses were assessed via independent research and voluntary surveys, which included 48 indicators in nine categories: administration, climate change and energy, food and recycling, green building, student involvement, transportation, endowment transparency, investment priorities, and shareholder engagement. Each category was given a grade (A-F), and an overall grade was awarded to the school. Profiles of the colleges and universities were published on the report card website.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.greenreportcard.org GreenReportCard.org]&lt;/ref&gt; Each profile includes the overall grade, categorical grades, and a description of efforts in each category. The website aimed to identify leading colleges and universities, as well as provide information for other schools to learn and adopt sustainability policies used elsewhere.&lt;ref name="The College Sustainability Report Card" /&gt;

The Green Report Card was a highly regarded metric for campus sustainability, being used by researchers to assess environmentally-friendly campuses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wang|first=Yutao|last2=Shi|first2=Han|last3=Sun|first3=Mingxing|last4=Huisingh|first4=Donald|last5=Hansson|first5=Lars|last6=Wang|first6=Renqing|date=2013-12-15|title=Moving towards an ecologically sound society?

[[Brown University]] is a leader when it comes to both campus sustainability and carbon neutrality. The university was one of only 26 universities across the country to receive an A- on the College Sustainability Report Card.&lt;ref name="Brown University"/&gt; Brown University is working with the Sidney E. Frank Foundation to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The program, named Community Carbon Use Reduction at Brown has received $350,000 and will help to reduce local carbon emissions through projects that will help meet the needs of Providence, Rhode Island neighborhoods while also reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The projects are created with the goals of: “Providing vibrant opportunities for learning for all those involved, engage non-university groups in thinking about how to increase the sustainability of the greater Providence area and its neighborhoods in a way that is responsive to the needs of the community, and lead to a measurable reduction in greenhouse gas emissions."&lt;ref name="University Commitments"/&gt; Brown University also has a plan to achieve carbon neutrality on campus. This plan entails carbon offset projects to “reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the local community and purchase carbon offset contracts."&lt;ref name="Energy and Environmental Advisory"/&gt; Additionally, Brown’s Energy and Environmental Advisory Committee is working to retrofit lights, motors, and mechanical equipment in existing buildings in order to reduce the university’s environmental impact and its carbon emissions. The University is also a member of the Rhode Island Student Climate Coalition which comprises five universities and nine high schools within the state of Rhode Island. The coalition is working to have a bill passed that would enable an 80 percent reduction in carbon emissions by the year 2050.&lt;ref name="Student Initiatives and Groups"/&gt;

===Other organizations===
There are many organizations in coordination with Second Nature and AASHE. Some work to establish carbon-neutral goals within colleges and universities. These include the Disciplinary Associations Network for Sustainability (DANS), the Higher Education Associations Sustainability Consortium, and the US Partnership for Education for Sustainable Development, and ecoAmerica.&lt;ref name="US Partnership"/&gt;

==International legislation and agreements==
Reducing carbon emissions has received international attention due to the theory that these emissions are one of the causes of global warming. There are national and internationally binding laws to try to reduce such greenhouse gases. If it were not for this legislation, universities would probably not be pushing for carbon neutrality themselves. Therefore, it is important to understand some of the key legislation when looking at how schools are trying to contribute to the solution.

===The Kyoto Protocol===
The [[Kyoto Protocol]] is an international agreement that requires countries to commit to reducing the greenhouse gases they emit into the atmosphere. The protocol was created in Kyoto, Japan on December 11, 1997 and put into practice on February 16, 2005.&lt;ref name="Kyoto Protocol UNFCCC"/&gt; The protocol targets industrialized countries because they are the ones producing most of the greenhouse gases.&lt;ref name="Kyoto Protocol UNFCCC"/&gt; Specific chemicals that it wants to reduce are carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, Sulfur hexafluoride, hydrofluorocarbons, and perfluorocarbons.&lt;ref name="Kyoto Protocol"/&gt; Thirty-seven industrialized countries and parts of Europe have signed and are bound by the agreement. The United States is not one of them.&lt;ref name="Kyoto Protocol UNFCCC"/&gt;
The Kyoto Protocol allots a specific amount of [[greenhouse gas]] emissions that each country can produce, however, countries can also trade emissions with other countries, resulting in the cap and trade system.&lt;ref name="Emissions Trading"/&gt; If one country has not used up all of its allotted emissions, it can sell them to other countries that have gone over their limit.&lt;ref name="Emissions Trading"/&gt;

===The Montreal Protocol===
The [[Montreal Protocol]] on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer is an international agreement that seeks to phase out chemicals that damage the ozone layer.&lt;ref name="Montreal Protocol"/&gt; The Montreal protocol was signed in 1987, went into practice in 1989, and was further amended in London in 1990 and in Copenhagen in 1992.&lt;ref name="Montreal Protocol"/&gt; The protocol set a quicker timetable for industrialized nations to phase out chemicals than it did for developing nations. For example, developed countries were to [[phase-out of chlorofluorocarbons|phase-out chlorofluorocarbons]] by 1995, but developing countries have until 2010 to phase out this chemical.&lt;ref name=Welch/&gt; Other chemicals that it wanted to phase out were halons, [[carbon tetrachloride]], [[methyl chloroform]], hydrochloroforlourocarbons, hydrobromofluorocarbons, and [[methyl bromide]].&lt;ref name=Welch/&gt;

===The Greenhouse Gas Protocol===
The Greenhouse Gas Protocol was created by the Climate Registry to establish a common method of reporting and measuring greenhouse gas emissions.&lt;ref name="GHG Protocol Initiative"/&gt; Thirty-four U.S. states, two Canadian provinces, and one American Indian tribe have joined.&lt;ref name="GHG Protocol Initiative"/&gt; Mexico, for example, is using the protocol a guideline for reducing its greenhouse gas emissions. As part of its three-step plan, Mexico will have voluntary emissions reporting, then it will have a greenhouse gas cap, and finally it will follow a cap- and-trade system.&lt;ref name="GHG Protocol Initiative"/&gt; In addition, “forty-two of the largest corporations follow GHG Protocol standards.”&lt;ref name="GHG Protocol Initiative"/&gt;

===Talloires Declaration===
The [[Talloires Declaration]] is the first official statement of a commitment to environmental sustainability in higher education. The declaration was made in 1990 at an international conference in France. The Talloires Declaration is an action plan consisting of ten points that aim to incorporate sustainability and environmental literacy in teaching, research, operations and outreach at universities.&lt;ref name="Talloires Declaration"/&gt; It was written with the premise that universities play a major role in the process of addressing and reversing the current trends of environmental changes because they prepare most of society's leaders and are therefore uniquely positioned to influence the direction that society takes.&lt;ref name=ULSF/&gt;
By signing the Talloires Declaration, a university agrees to:
{{quote|
# Increase Awareness of Environmentally Sustainable Development
# Create an Institutional Culture of Sustainability
# Educate for Environmentally Responsible Citizenship
# Foster Environmental Literacy for All
# Practice Institutional Ecology
# Involve all Stakeholders
# Collaborate for Interdisciplinary Approaches
# Enhance Capacity of Primary and Secondary Schools
# Broaden Service and Outreach Nationally and Internationally
# Maintain the Movement &lt;ref name="Talloires Declaration"/&gt;}}

===Climate Neutral Network===
The Climate Neutral Network is “an initiative led by the [[United Nations Environment Programme]] to promote global action to de-carbonize our economies and societies."&lt;ref name="Climate Neutrality with Honours"/&gt; The initiative involves universities, colleges, and other academic institutions worldwide and its aim is to work together in order to transform so that they can have a zero emission future. Like the Presidential Climate Commitment, the Climate Neutral Network is designed with the premise that colleges and universities are vital components in addressing climate change "because they can model climate neutrality on their campuses, and they can teach their students skills and knowledge they need to address the climate crisis."&lt;ref name="Climate Neutrality with Honours"/&gt;

====University of Malaga (Spain)====
[[University of Málaga]] (UMA) announced its participation in UNEP's Climate Neutral Network in July 2009.&lt;ref name=Matthes/&gt; As an urban campus, Malaga University has focused on building infrastructure and facilities for renewable energy production and fostering low-impact transportation to further its goals of being carbon neutral. In the realm of transit, the University plans on completing a subway line between the local city center and the University center by 2012,&lt;ref name="UNEP AO"/&gt; as well as facilitating the growth of bicycle and pedestrian portions of traffic.&lt;ref name="UNEP AO"/&gt; UMA has also planned or constructed installations of solar thermal and photovoltaic generation on its campus, and is currently constructing a photovoltaic installation aimed to produce one megawatt of energy for the school.&lt;ref name=Matthes/&gt;&lt;ref name="UNEP AO"/&gt; The school is also investing in co- and tri-generation technologies that incorporate fuel-burning generation and secondary heat capture aided by geothermal heat.&lt;ref name=Matthes/&gt; The campus' immediate goal is to rely entirely on sustainable sources of power.&lt;ref name=Mascarelli/&gt;

====Tongji University (China)====
[[Tongji University]] in [[Shanghai]], China was one of the first six schools to join the Climate Neutral Network.&lt;ref name="Climate Neutrality with Honours"/&gt; Tongji is using technology, management, and education and participation to meet its goal of using fewer resources.&lt;ref name="Construction"/&gt; Tongji is saving energy by using [[solar water heating]] and re-using waste water in its bath house.&lt;ref name="Construction"/&gt; Additional steps are being taken to save energy in many of the university’s buildings, such as “[[low-E windows]], [[architectural sun shading]], [[roof greening]], and [[energy-saving lighting]].”&lt;ref name="Construction"/&gt;  The Wenyuan building, for example, uses “[[geo-heat pumps]], thermal insulation systems, [[rainwater collection]] and recycling systems.”&lt;ref name="Climate Neutrality with Honours"/&gt;
The Tongji Fuel Cell Vehicle Engineering Center is helping to create [[fuel cell vehicles]]. These fuel cell powered sedans can travel 150 miles  per hour and can “cover up to 300 miles after one hydrogen charging.”&lt;ref name="Climate Neutrality with Honours"/&gt;

====University of the West of England (UK)====
[[University of the West of England]] is part of the Climate Neutral Network and with this, it is committed to reducing climate change. This entails reducing greenhouse gas emissions, so to accomplish this, the university developed a carbon management plan in partnership with [[Carbon Trust]]. The aim of the university’s carbon management plan is “to use energy more efficiently to progressively reduce dependency on fossil fuels and contribute to achieving the UK target of an 80 percent reduction in carbon dioxide emissions by 2050."&lt;ref name="University of the West of England"/&gt; The critical objectives of the plan are to: "reduce energy use in buildings, including residential buildings; implement an energy awareness campaign; implement 80 percent of the technical carbon saving measures detailed in the Carbon Management Plan; aim to achieve [[BREEAM]] rating of at least “Very Good” for energy aspects of new buildings; and to consider the procurement of a proportion of electricity from renewable sources where economic to do so."&lt;ref name="University of the West of England"/&gt; Additionally, the University of the West of England is a member of the West of England Carbon Challenge. As a member, the university has pledged to reduce its emissions over the course of four years in order to have an overall 10 percent decrease in emissions by 2012.&lt;ref name="What is the West of England"/&gt;

{{no footnotes|date=March 2013}}
{{aquatic layer topics}}
A '''chemocline''' is a [[Cline (hydrology)|cline]] caused by a strong, vertical [[chemistry]] gradient within a body of [[water]]. A chemocline is analogous to a [[thermocline]], the border at which warmer and cooler waters meet in an ocean, sea, lake, or other body of water. (In some cases, the thermocline and chemocline coincide.)

Chemoclines most commonly occur where local conditions favor the formations of anoxic bottom water &amp;mdash; deep water deficient in [[oxygen]], where only [[Anaerobic organism|anaerobic]] forms of life can exist. The [[Black Sea]] is the classic example of such a body, though similar bodies of water (classified as [[meromictic]] lakes) exist across the globe. [[Aerobic organism|Aerobic]] life is restricted to the region above the chemocline, anaerobic below. Photosynthetic forms of anaerobic [[bacteria]], like green phototrophic and [[purple sulfur bacteria]], cluster at the chemocline, taking advantage of both the sunlight from above and the [[hydrogen sulfide]] (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S) produced by the anaerobic bacteria below.

In any body of water in which oxygen-rich surface waters are well-mixed ([[holomictic]]), no chemocline will exist. To cite the most obvious example, the Earth's global ocean has no chemocline.

==Types of clines==
* [[Thermocline]] - A cline based on difference in water [[temperature]]
* [[Halocline]]  - A cline based on difference in water [[salinity]]
* [[Pycnocline]] - A cline based on difference in water [[density]]

'''[[Community gardening]] in the [[United States]]''' encompasses a wide variety of approaches. Community gardens can function as gathering places for neighbors, promote healthier eating, and showcase art to raise ecological awareness (see [[Karl Linn]]). Other gardens resemble European "[[Allotment (gardening)|allotment]]" gardens, with plots where individuals and families can grow vegetables and flowers; including a number which began as "[[victory garden]]s" during [[World War II]].

Some community gardens are devoted entirely to creating ecological [[Urban open space|green space]] or habitat, growing flowers, educational purposes, or providing access to gardening to those who otherwise could not have a garden, such as the elderly, recent immigrants, urban dwellers, or the [[Homelessness in the United States|homeless]]. Some gardens are worked as community farms with no individual plots at all, similar to [[urban farms]].

Community gardens can vary in shape, size, and function, but the goal of bridging the gap between people and nature is central to their creation. These gardens weaken the divide between nature and culture, city and country, and producer and consumer.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Sustainable Food Systems|last=Biel|first=Robert|publisher=UCL Press|isbn=|location=|pages=90–107|chapter=Built systems, biomimicry and urban food-growing}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Certomà|first=Chiara|date=2015|title=Critical Urban Gardening|url=|journal=RCC Perspectives, Think Global, Eat Local: Exploring Foodways|volume=No.1|pages=13–18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The largest community garden in the nation is reported to be Shiloh Field Community Garden in [[Denton, TX]], measuring at 14.5 acres of land.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wylie|first1=Melissa|title=Largest community garden in U.S. feeds the hungry in Denton|url=http://www.dallasnews.com/news/metro/20140404-largest-community-garden-in-u.s.-feeds-needy-in-denton.ece|accessdate=2 August 2015|work=The Dallas Morning News|publisher=James M.

== Overview ==
[[File:South Central Farm 6.jpg|thumb|Crops at the former [[South Central Farm]] in [[Los Angeles]], [[California]]]]

A community garden is any piece of land gardened by a group of people.&lt;ref&gt;American Community Gardening Association. Website: {{cite web |url=http://www.communitygarden.org/learn |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-02-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110307123844/http://www.communitygarden.org/learn/ |archivedate=2011-03-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of gardens in community gardening programs are collections of individual garden plots, frequently between {{convert|3|x|3|m|ft|abbr=on}} and {{convert|6|x|6|m|ft|abbr=on}}. This holds true whether they are sponsored by public agencies, city departments, large non-profits, or (most commonly) a coalition of different entities and groups.

Whether the garden is run as a co-op by the gardeners themselves (common in [[New York City]], [[Boston]] and other East Coast cities) or managed by a public or non-profit agency, plot holders typically are asked to pay a modest fee each year and to abide by a set of rules. Many gardens encourage activities such as work days, fundraisers, and social gatherings. Community garden organizers typically say that "growing community" is as important as growing vegetables; or, as the [[American Community Gardening Association]] (ACGA) puts it: "In community gardening, 'community' comes first." The ACGA, a non-profit coalition founded in 1979, is the primary advocacy group for community gardening in the US and Canada.

Community gardening in the United States overlaps to some extent with the related but distinct movement to encourage local food production, local farmers' markets and [[community supported agriculture]] farms (CSAs). Leases and rules prevent some, though not all, community gardeners from selling their produce commercially, although their gardens may donate fresh fruits and vegetables to local food pantries, cooperatives, and homeless members of their community.

However, community gardens offer ideal sites for local farmers markets, and gardeners often seek farmers to provide space-intensive crops such as corn or potatoes. They also can hire farmers to provide services such as plowing and providing mulch and manure. In turn, small farmers can reach a wider audience and consumer base by drawing on community gardeners and their contacts. Although the two approaches are distinct, both can be effective ways to produce local food in urban areas, safeguard green space, and contribute to food security. Community gardens also increase environmental aesthetics, promote neighborhood attachment and social involvement.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;Litt et al 2011. The Influence of Social Involvement, Neighborhood Aesthetics, and Community Garden Participation on Fruit and Vegetable Consumption. {{PMID|21680931}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;McCormack et al 2010. Review of the Nutritional Implications of Farmers’ Markets and Community Gardens: A Call for Evaluation and Research Efforts {{PMID|20184990}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robinson-O'Brien et al 2009. Impact of Garden-Based Youth Nutrition Intervention Programs: A Review {{PMID|19167954}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interesting variant on the practice of reclaiming bombed-out areas for community gardens (also practiced during WWII in the ghettos of Eastern Europe), in American inner-cities, community groups have reclaimed abandoned or vacant lots for garden plots. In these cases, groups have subsequently leased from a municipality that claims the property or claimed squatter's rights or a right to subsistence not currently recognized by the legal system. Two notable cases include the gardens of Manhattan's lower Eastside and the [[South Central Farm]] of Los Angeles, California. A lasting legacy of the New York gardens is 'guerrilla gardening', and the historically important "Green Guerrillas" founded by [[Liz Christy]]. In contrast, The South Central Farm was recently bulldozed in Los Angeles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.treehugger.com/files/2006/06/south_central_farm_shut_down.php|title=LA's South Central Farm Shut Down and Bulldozed|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Community gardens often face pressure due to economic development, rising land values, and decreased city government budgets. In some cases they have responded to the changes by forming nonprofit organizations to provide assistance and by building gardens on city park spaces and school yards.&lt;ref name=HessLocalistMovements&gt;{{cite book|last=Hess|first=David J.|title=Localist Movements in a Global Economy: Sustainability, Justice, and Urban Development in the United States|year=2009|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge, MA|isbn=978-0-262-01264-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=HessCaseStudies&gt;{{cite web|last=Hess|first=David J.|title=Case Studies of Community Gardens|url=http://www.davidjhess.org/sustlocCasesTOC.html|accessdate=22 July 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130130043602/http://www.davidjhess.org/sustlocCasesTOC.html#|archive-date=2013-01-30|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The European history of community gardening in the US dates back to the early 18th century, when [[Moravians]] created a community garden as part of the community of Bethabara, near modern Winston-Salem, North Carolina – a garden still active and open for visitors today. [[First Nations]] peoples also gardened with a community approach (''Buffalo Bird Woman's Garden''{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} paints a picture of gardens among the [[Hidatsa]]), likely for generations before the arrival of waves of immigrants.

During World War I and World War II, some [[Victory garden]]s were planted on public land.

Academic study of American community gardening by T.J. Bassett and more recently Laura Lawson ("City Bountiful") suggests that the community gardening "movement" is best described as a series of distinct phases each with contrasting ideologies and purposes, even though all resulted in people creating gardens on public or abandoned land. The latest phase began with the alternative politics and culture and dawning ecological activism of the late 1960s.

From the mid-1970s through the early 1990s, community gardening in a select number of major American cities enjoyed Federal financial support{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}, though many programs struggled to find funding. The loss of the Federal program increased the challenge of finding funding to support programs. Funding remains a key challenge, along with secure land tenure for garden sites, finding insurance, and helping gardeners develop ways to work together smoothly.

== Health impacts ==
Community gardens benefit community food access by enhancing nutrition and physical activity as well as promoting the role of public health.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Food and Society: Principles and Paradoxes|last=Guptill|first=Amy E.|publisher=Polity Press|year=2012|pages=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services recommends eating more dark green vegetables, orange vegetables, legumes, and fruits; eating less refined grains, fat, and calories; and obtaining 60 minutes of physical activity on most days.&lt;ref&gt;US Dept of Health and Human Services 6th ed. 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Recent public health evaluations show community gardens as a promising approach to promote healthy behaviors.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alaimo et al 2008. Fruit and Vegetable Intake among Urban Community Gardeners {{PMID|18314085}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is particularly important in establishing healthy behaviors among children given the rise of childhood obesity. One recent pilot study in Los Angeles showed a gardening and nutrition intervention improved dietary intake in children and reduced body mass index.&lt;ref&gt;Davis et al. 2011. LA Sprouts: A gardening, nutrition, and cooking intervention for Latino youth improves diet and Reduces Obesity. {{PMID|21802571}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Community gardens also benefit community food security by providing residents with safe, culturally acceptable, nutritionally adequate diet through a sustainable food system that maximizes community self-reliance and social justice.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Cultivating food justice: Race, class, and sustainability.|last=Alkon|first=A. H|publisher=MIT Press|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Community garden initiatives have inspired cities to enact policies for water use, improved access to produce, strengthened community building skills, and created culturally appropriate education programs that help elevate the community's collective consciousness about public health.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Food and Society|last=Guptill|first=Amy|publisher=Polity|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In impoverished urban areas especially, produce harvested from community gardens provides a nutritious alternative to what Nancy Janovicek calls "the industrial diet," which consists of cheap and accessible options like fast-food chains.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Janovicek|first=Nancy|date=2016|title=Seeds of Knowledge From Back-to-the-Land to Urban Gardening|url=|journal=RCC Perspectives, ENVIRONMENTAL KNOWLEDGE, ENVIRONMENTALPOLITICS: Case Studies from Canada and Western Europe|volume=No. 4|pages=33–40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Professor Jill Litt and colleagues at University of Colorado School of Public Health evaluated the effects on community gardening in the Denver metro area on social environment, community building and fruit and vegetable intake. Community gardeners were more likely than home gardeners and non-gardeners to meet the national recommendations of fruit and vegetable intake.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt; Semistructured interviews carried out by Teig ''et al.'' revealed that Denver community gardeners felt a high level of trust between members of the garden and a strong sense of community.&lt;ref&gt;Teig et al 2009. Collective efficacy in Denver, Colorado: Strengthening neighborhoods and health through community gardens. {{PMID|19577947}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, gardeners were involved in community voluntary efforts and donated surplus produce to populations without access to fresh produce.

== Environmental impacts ==
Community gardens have the potential to positively impact the areas around them. If gardeners employ organic and environmentally conscious techniques, the community gardens can be a step away from chemically dependent and wasteful food systems.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Gardens that produce crops and vegetables act to reduce the need for fossil-fuel intensive storage of delivery of food to local community members.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; As researcher Montenegro de Wit states, sustainable agriculture should not be "contained to the countryside."&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Montenegro de Wit|first=Maywa|date=2014|title=A Lighthouse for Urban Agriculture University, Community, and Redefining Expertise in the Food System|url=|journal=Gastronomica|volume= 14| issue =  1|pages=9–22}}&lt;/ref&gt; By bringing these techniques into communities, learning opportunities arise as well as the chance of converting land from an "emissions-source" to a "carbon sink" as Robert Biel writes.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In addition to the possible environmental benefits community gardening brings, there are unintended consequences that can result from poor planning and lack of ecological consideration. For example, if most community members have to drive a considerate distance to reach their community garden or farmer's market, the benefits of locally sourced food evens out. The carbon emissions of travel to the community garden, step closer to those of commercial packaging and transportation costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cleveland|first=David|date=2015|title=How does food localization contribute to food system sustainability?|url=|journal=Frontiers in Ecology and the Environment|volume= 13| issue =  8|pages=410–411}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Social, economic, and cultural impacts ==
Community gardens play a part in a larger food systems movements such as [[Food Justice Movement|food justice]], [[food sovereignty]], [[food security]], [[Urban agriculture|urban farming]], and more. These movements are not only happening in the United States, but transnationally in the Global North and the Global South.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Social ===

Agricultural activity in communities is a way of promoting self-sufficiency, as well as community empowerment and involvement.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Additionally, producing food, helping the environment, and creating green spaces in cities contributes to an overall increase in happiness by helping community members accomplish fundamental human tasks such as growing food.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Space in cities and communities reserved for growing vegetables and flowers promotes wellbeing, neighborliness, and the protection of nature.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Economic ===

As the majority of the United States' farmers reach retirement age,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.agcensus.usda.gov/Publications/2012/Online_Resources/Highlights/Farm_Demographics/|title=2012 Census Highlights, Farm Demographics|last=|first=|date=May 2014|website=USDA Census of Agriculture|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=15 Apr 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; community gardens play an active role in informing and perhaps inspiring a new generation to become involved with and passionate about growing food.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Diversifying the food system with community gardens and other methods of urban agriculture will benefit the economy and create competition between product quality and value.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cohen|first=B. R.|date=Spring 2014|title=Don’t Mono-crop the Movement Toward a Cultural Ecology of Local Food|url=|journal=Gastronomica|volume= 14| issue =  1|pages=5–8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Green spaces in cities often increase the land value of an area and contribute to [[gentrification]]. The perception of organic foods being for an affluent population, plus the perceived notion of eliteness that comes from organic-based market chains like [[Whole Foods Market|Whole Foods]] and [[Trader Joe's]] work against the goals of most urban agricultural initiatives by creating exclusive spaces.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Community gardens based on crop sharing, knowledge sharing, and community building help to promote access to healthy foods by creating accessible spaces.

One issue faced by lower-income citizens is that they don't have the time or energy needed for becoming active in a community garden, and therefore struggle to receive the benefits they offer. Community gardens that are working for high crop yields are labor-intensive, and some community members may work multiple jobs and have little to no extra time to commit.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; One way that lower-income citizens can gain access to healthy food is through the [[Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program|SNAP program]], which is increasingly being accepted at farmer's markets.

=== Cultural ===

Community gardens are a way for a variety of cultures to come together and create a stronger community. Focusing on creating equitable and respectful spaces where farming knowledge can be shared is crucial to creating a just food system for all community members. Communities hold specific knowledge and expertise about their local environment, and therefore, community members have the power to play a central role in the creation of their local food system.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Partnerships between academic researchers, farmers/practitioners, advocates, and community members will filter knowledge of healthy foods and farming techniques throughout the community as a whole. All of these benefits will lead, in researcher Montenegro de Wit's opinion, to "a more egalitarian food system" that "will likely emerge from participation by those traditionally excluded from it."&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

{{further|Urban agriculture in West Oakland}}
;San Francisco, California
In [[San Francisco]], community gardens are available through various public and private entities. Most community gardens in San Francisco are available through its Recreation and Park Department, which manages over 35 community gardens on City property. These are allotment gardens whereby individuals or groups volunteer to be assigned garden plots. Garden members within their respective gardens democratically organize themselves to set bylaws that are consistent with City policy. These gardeners often self-impose garden dues as a membership requirement to cover common expenses. To standardize the development and management of its community gardens, the Recreation and Park Commission adopted its Community Garden Policy in 2006.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}

Though not plot-based, the City's Department of Public Works supports communal-style [[gardening]] on City property whereby community groups participate in the development and maintenance of public gardens. No one person is responsible for any portion of the site. One group, a community-based and resident-led volunteer group in an underserved neighborhood called Bayview Hunters Point, has created an enclosed food-producing garden on City-owned land, as well as developed many residential urban farms around privately owned homes. This group, the Quesada Gardens Initiative, is one of many organizations in the San Francisco Bay Area working at the nexus of environmental justice, health and wellness and food security, and community-building.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017|reason=Need to provide a direct link to photos, directions, and descriptions of San Fran community gardens, as stated in the second half of entence.}}

Although Gateway Greening is a major proponent of community gardening in St. Louis, it is by no means the only group to create or support STL Urban Agriculture. Community gardening and urban agriculture has taken off in St. Louis, Missouri, in recent years in part thanks to the Garden Lease Program&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.stlouis-mo.gov/government/departments/sldc/real-estate/garden-lease.cfm|title=Garden Lease Program|website=stlouis-mo.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; which allows residents to lease LRA land for a period of 5 years.

=== Washington state ===
;Seattle, Washington
The [[Seattle]] [[P-Patch]] program for community garden plots began in the early 70s during an economic downturn known locally as the "[[Boeing]] Bust" which had resulted in many people without work or money. Darlyn Rundberg Del Boca, a University of Washington student, saw an opportunity to promote children's gardening with a focus on growing for the local Neighbors in Need [[food bank]] program, and with the help of a Seattle Councilmember obtained permission to use part of the Picardo family's truck garden in northeast Seattle with the City of Seattle renting the land for the cost of its real estate taxes. The first garden consisted of a large central garden plot planted by children from the nearby elementary school and their parents; families who volunteered to help were offered smaller individual plots around the perimeter of the central plot. The City subsequently purchased the Picardo farm, and the program of renting individual garden plots arising from the first efforts was named 'P-Patch' in honor of the Picardo family's contribution. The P-Patch program continued to grow and currently consists of 1900 plots in 68 locations with a total of {{convert|23|acre|m2}} of land, with additions planned each year, and the tradition of growing for local food banks resulted in 12.3 tons of food donated in 2008.&lt;ref name=HessSeattle&gt;{{cite web|last=Hess|first=David J.|title=Case Studies of Community Gardens: Seattle's P Patches|url=http://www.davidjhess.org/SeattleCG.pdf|work=www.davidjhess.org|accessdate=22 July 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091013001300/http://www.davidjhess.org/SeattleCG.pdf#|archive-date=2009-10-13|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Zweimassenschwungrad und kupplung aufgeschnitten.jpg|thumb|Dual-mass flywheel section]]
A '''dual-mass flywheel''' ('''DMF''') is a rotating mechanical device that is used to provide continuous energy ([[rotational energy]]) in systems where the energy source is not continuous, the same way as a conventional [[flywheel]] acts, but damping any violent variation of torque or revolutions that could cause an unwanted vibration. The [[vibration]] reduction is  achieved by accumulating stored energy in the two  flywheel half masses over a period of time but damped  by a series of strong [[Spring (device)|spring]]s, doing that at a rate that is compatible with the energy source, and then releasing that energy at a much higher rate over a relatively short time. A compact dual-mass [[flywheel]] often includes the whole clutch, including the pressure plate and the friction disc.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.luk.de/content.luk.de/en/products/clutch_systems_new/zms_new/zms_new.jsp Luk DMF's]&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[File:Torque_Converter_Centrifugal_Pendulum_Absorber.png|thumb|right|[[Schaeffler Group|Schaeffler]] torque converter with a pendulum absorber using the same DMF's bent springs.]]
Dual-mass flywheels were developed to address the escalation of torque and power, especially at low revs. The growing concern for the environment and the adoption of more stringent regulations have marked the development of more efficient new engines, lowering the cylinder number to 3 or even 2 cylinders, and allowing the delivery of more torque and power at low revolutions. The counterpart has been an increase in the level of vibration which traditional [[clutch]] discs are unable to absorb. This is where the dual-mass flywheels play a key role, making these mechanical developments more viable.&lt;ref name = LUK-Symposia&gt;[http://www.schaeffler.com/remotemedien/media/_shared_media/08_media_library/01_publications/schaeffler_2/symposia_1/downloads_11/luK_kolloquium_en.pdf LUK Symposia]&lt;/ref&gt;

The absorption capacity of the vibration depends on the moving parts of the DMF, these parts are subject to wear. Whenever the clutch is replaced, the DMF should be checked for wear. The two key wear characteristics are freeplay and sideplay (rock). These should be measured to determine whether the flywheel is serviceable. The wear limit specifications can be found in vehicle or flywheel manufacturer's published documentation. Other failure modes are severely grooved/damaged clutch mating surface, grease loss, and cracking.&lt;ref name = LUK-Symposia/&gt;

== Types ==
[[File: DMF.svg | thumb | Principle of dual-mass flywheel.&lt;br&gt;Black: absorber springs. &lt;br&gt; Red: flywheel, crankshaft side&lt;br&gt; Blue: flywheel, transmission side]]
The main type is called a ''planetary DMF''. The planetary gear and the torsional damper are incorporated into the main  flywheel. For this purpose, the main flywheel is divided into primary and secondary pinion-connected masses, and between them there are four different types of bent springs:

=== Individual bent spring ===
The simplest form of the bent spring is the standard single spring.

=== One-phase bent springs in parallel ===
The standard springs are called parallel springs of one phase. These consist of an outer and an inner spring of almost equal lengths and connected in parallel. The individual characteristic curves of the two springs are added to form the characteristic curve of the spring pair.

=== Two-phase bent springs in parallel ===
In the case of two-stage spring there are two curved parallel springs, one inside the other, but the internal spring is shorter so that it acts later. The characteristic curve of the outer spring is adapted to increase when the engine is started. The softer outer spring only acts to increase the problematic resonance frequency range. When the torque increases, reaching the maximum value, the internal spring also acts. In this second phase, the inner and outer springs work together. The collaboration of both springs thus ensures good acoustic isolation at all engine speeds.

=== Three-phase bent spring ===
This curved spring consists of an outer and two inner springs with different elastic characteristics connected in series. This category of bent spring uses the two concepts together: parallel and series connection in order to ensure optimal torsional compensation for each value of torque.

'''Dynamic line rating''' (DLR), also known as '''real-time thermal rating''' (RTTR), and in German ''Freileitungsmonitoring'' (FLM), is an [[electric power transmission]] operation philosophy aiming at maximizing load, when environmental conditions allow it, without compromising safety. Research, prototyping and pilot projects were initiated in the 1990s, but the emergence of the "[[smart grid]]" stimulated [[electric utilities]], scientists and vendors to develop comprehensive and sustainable solutions.

==Principles and applications==
The current-carrying capacity, or [[ampacity]], of overhead lines starts with the type of conductor used. The conductor choice provides the physical parameters for dynamic line rating. Transmission ratings are set with a maximum allowable conductor temperature (annealing temperature) and minimum clearance rules to adhere to legislation. Both the temperature and the minimum clearance of a transmission line is affected by the number of amps flowing through the wire, corresponding to the Joule Effect&lt;ref&gt;David M. Greenwood, Student Member, IEEE, Jake P. Gentle, Member, IEEE, Kurt S. Myers, Peter J. Davison,Isaac J. West, Jason W. Bush, Grant L. Ingram, and Matthias C. M. Troffaes (2014), "A Comparison of Real-Time Thermal Rating Systems in the U.S. and the U.K.".''IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery'', Vol 29, No 4, August 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

Ampacity&lt;ref&gt;“The Ampacity of a conductor is that current which will meet the design, security and safety criteria of a particular line on which the conductor is used” (in [https://e-cigre.org/publication/498-guide-for-application-of-direct-real-time-monitoring-systems CIGRÉ TB-498] - Guide for Application of Direct Real-Time Monitoring Systems)&lt;/ref&gt; has traditionally been limited by conductor thermal capacity defined in terms of Static Rating (SR), based on a predetermined set of worst-case weather scenarios with high reliability levels (typically: simultaneous occurrence of (i) conservative minimum perpendicular wind speed of about 0.5-0.6 [m/s], (ii) conservative high solar radiation of about 1000 [W/m²] and (iii) conservative high ambient temperature defined by season).

===Real Time Dynamic Line Rating===
More often than not, there are unused margins between the limits defined by static ratings and the "true limits" measured by a DLR/RTTR system.
Several methods have been developed since the 1990s. Most of them rely upon sensors deployed on overhead lines, measuring parameters in real-time. Other systems utilize weather stations that monitor environmental conditions without contacting the line. Data received from any method is reported to a main computer for processing. Control center operators access usable data (line temperature, ratings, forecasts, historical values) in pseudo-real-time through a human-machine interface (HMI).

===Wind Generation Integration===
Wind generation requires an area that has consistent wind conditions. When new wind generation is prospected the grid connection point must also be analyzed. Adding new generation to the grid typically requires an infrastructure buildup that can potentially cost millions of dollars.&lt;ref&gt;Western Electricity Coordinating Council, pg.2-3, [''https://www.wecc.biz/Reliability/2014_TEPPC_Transmission_CapCost_Report_B+V.pdf'']&lt;/ref&gt; In some circumstances a phenomenon, known as concurrent cooling, can be utilized to mitigate the expenses. Concurrent cooling is the cooling of transmission lines, thus increasing [[ampacity]], when the wind power is generating.

===Dynamic Line Rating Reception===
DLR methods and technologies are considered "mature" by industry groups like ENTSO-E after field validations for various applications. Transmission utilities in Asia, Europe, North America, and South America have included deployment of DLR in their grid development roadmaps. [[IEEE]] and [[CIGRE|CIGRÉ]] devised standard thermal modeling of conductors for ampacity calculations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://standards.ieee.org/findstds/standard/738-2006.html|title=IEEE 738-2006 - IEEE Standard for Calculating the Current-Temperature of Bare Overhead Conductors|website=standards.ieee.org|accessdate=18 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; CIGRÉ issued guidelines for DLR.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://e-cigre.org/publication/207-thermal-behaviour-of-overhead-conductors|title=Thermal behaviour of overhead conductors.|website=e-cigré|accessdate=18 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Deploying DLR consists in equipping circuits likely to benefit from significant capacity gains with sensors and using the resulting capacity increases when required and possible.
Typical applications:
*Relaxing congestions due to increasing load
*Improving economic dispatch scenarios in N-1 contingencies
*Integrating renewable/distributed energy sources without grid reinforcement
*Deferring or avoiding uprating of circuits
*Maximizing the use of alternate lines when main corridors are undergoing long maintenance works/overhauls
*Maximizing transit on interconnectors and "bottleneck" topologies
*Addressing potential safety/conformance issues

These subjects are addressed at load dispatch center level, and by planning and maintenance departments. However, to decide on priorities, simulations based on 3D line profile analysis and weather data are sometimes performed prior to deployment.

There are two categories of DLR computation methods:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.egypro.2017.03.735 |title=Study of the Monitoring Systems for Dynamic Line Rating |journal=Energy Procedia |volume=105 |pages=2557–2562 |year=2017 |last1=Morozovska |first1=Kateryna |last2=Hilber |first2=Patrik }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Direct measurement methods use devices that are directly coupled to the line. These devices measure temperature, tension, sag or clearance from which the thermal rating is determined (or a combination of the above)
*Indirect measurement methods use weather stations and modeling

Direct methods give actual conductor state condition with respect to clearance rules and/or maximum conductor temperature. Indirect methods provide estimates based on prevailing, forecast, or measured weather conditions around the line. Computational fluid dynamics models can be used to provide a larger effective area to a single weather station by mapping wind patterns around the terrain &lt;ref&gt;

''Improvement of Transmission Line Ampacity Utilization by Weather-Based Dynamic Line Rating''. IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery. Vol 33, Issue 4, Aug 2018. Pg. 1853-1863&lt;/ref&gt; Direct methods are strongly recommended by CIGRÉ standards [https://e-cigre.org/publication/207-thermal-behaviour-of-overhead-conductors TB 207] and [https://e-cigre.org/publication/498-guide-for-application-of-direct-real-time-monitoring-systems TB 498] - Guidelines for thermal rating and real-time monitoring).

Several kinds of ratings are available, depending on input parameters and algorithms. Real-time ratings allow control room engineers to adjust power flows according to normal operational events or contingencies. They are based on "steady-state (equilibrium) ampacity" calculations. Emergency ratings are based on transient equations and models: they provide permissible overload ratings for a short and adjustable time (typically 5 to 30 minutes).
Forecasting methods have been developed to determine intraday and day-ahead ampacity forecasts. They combine DLR historical measurements and weather forecasts. These methods are proprietary, they are promoted by expert and industry associations like CIGRÉ's [http://b2.cigre.org/What-is-SC-B2 Study Committee B2] and the [https://watt-transmission.org/about/ WATT Coalition].

While DLR solutions can be implemented as stand-alone, their destination is system integration in the control room with the electric utility [[SCADA]]. Energy Management Solution and Distribution Management Solutions vendors propose this type of integration to enhance their offering.

==History and perspectives==

Pioneer companies, now defunct, followed initiatives by the US [[United States Department of Energy|Department of Energy]], electric utiities [http://www.oncor.com ONCOR] and [https://www.nypa.gov/ NYPA], [https://www.entsoe.eu/ ENTSO-E] and the European Commission's [https://setis.ec.europa.eu/energy-research/ Energy Research programme]. They contributed in setting the standards and paved the way for more advanced solutions. The most active manufacturers originate in North America and Europe where market stimulation is strongest. Experiments were conducted in order to field-test available technologies and to quantify benefits, in terms of available transit gains and capital expenditure savings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://docstore.entsoe.eu/Documents/SOC%20documents/Regional_Groups_Continental_Europe/Dynamic_Line_Rating_V6.pdf |title=Dynamic Line Rating for overhead lines |date=30 March 2015 |publisher=[[European Network of Transmission System Operators for Electricity]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.smartgrid.gov/files/NYPA-Evaluation-Instrumentation-Dynamic-Thermal-Ratings-Overhead-Lines-Final.pdf |title=Evaluation of Instrumentation and Dynamic Thermal Ratings for Overhead Lines |date=October 11, 2013 |publisher=[[Electric Power Research Institute]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sgemfinalreport.fi/files/D5.1.55%20-%20Dynamic%20line%20rating.pdf |title=Maximising power line transmission capability by employing dynamic line ratings – technical survey and applicability in Finland |date=February 28, 2013 |first1=Sanna |last1=Uski-Joutsenvuo |first2=Riku |last2=Pasonen |publisher=[[VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-226564 |title=Dynamic Rating of Power Lines and Transformers for Wind Energy Integration |type=Licentiate Thesis |last1=Morozovska |first1=Kateryna |year=2018 |publisher=[[KTH Royal Institute of Technology]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article |url=http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-238612 |title=DLR use for optimization of network design with very large wind (and VRE) penetration |type=Conference paper |last1=Estanqueiro |first1=Ana |last2=Ahlrot |first2=Claes |last3=Duque |first3=Joaquim |last4=Santos |first4=Duarte |last5=Gentle |first5=Jake P. |last6=Abboud |first6=Alexander W. |last7=Morozovska |first7=Kateryna |last8=Hilber |first8=Patrik |last9=Lennart |first9=Söder |last10=Kanefendt |first10=Thomas |year=2018 |publisher=[[Energynautics GmbH]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Operation expenditure gains are more delicate to evaluate since they depend on grid codes, local regulation rules, incentives and penalties.

Benefits recorded have attracted the attention of investors, governments and international development aid institutions, who include a DLR share in the scope of their green-field powerline construction projects.

''An academic view of these technologies, by Jean-Louis Lilien, Honorarium Professor, [[University of Liège]], Belgium:

Dynamic (electrical overhead-)line rating is a great opportunity for transmission line operators (any voltage from 15 kV to 735 kV and over). It has been studied for more than 20 years inside CIGRE and IEEE working groups. But technology (sensors, weather forecast), as well as national or supra national rules, didn’t allow to generate a financial return for the owners of the line, which is nowadays (2018) possible in many countries.
Moreover, the electricity generation mix is strongly changing in many countries due to the large deployment of wind and solar farms. The power flows are therefore changing a lot because of renewables and intercountry exchanges,  where potential larger transit (owing to DLR) allows lower market electricity cost.

There are large opportunities owing to technology miniaturization (accelerometers, digital signal processing for embedded data treatment, telecommunications, etc.) as well as new development in weather forecasts (which are nowadays much more accurate and require less computational power than only a few years ago), including for these last, up to 72 hours ahead. Availability of this equipment and data for reasonable costs help to develop new sensors and systems which may be implemented into the EMS (energy management system) of national or local dispatching. These dynamic line rating sensors may sometimes warranty up to 30% more power transit in the monitored lines, depending on wind speed which is actually and locally evaluated by appropriate sensors using intelligent data processing.

The original development of sensors, including advanced treatment (reinforced learning for example) help to largely deploy these sensors on power lines.

Capacity forecasting seems to be the new promise of DLR, mixing on-line sensors with reliable weather data forecast, up to two days ahead.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | url=https://hal-mines-paristech.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01199238 | doi=10.1016/j.rser.2015.07.134| title=Forecasting for dynamic line rating| journal=Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews| volume=52| pages=1713–1730| year=2015| last1=Michiorri| first1=Andrea| last2=Nguyen| first2=Huu-Minh| last3=Alessandrini| first3=Stefano| last4=Bremnes| first4=John Bjørnar| last5=Dierer| first5=Silke| last6=Ferrero| first6=Enrico| last7=Nygaard| first7=Bjørn-Egil| last8=Pinson| first8=Pierre| last9=Thomaidis| first9=Nikolaos| last10=Uski| first10=Sanna}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this field, significant social welfare benefits are expected inasmuch as capacity forecasts favour converging zonal prices and a decrease in congestion rents.

==Computation methods and applicable standards==
Direct measurement methods use field data measured to inform on line condition (conductor temperature, sagging, clearances) and on weather parameters (ambient temperature, solar radiation, wind velocity). Spans deemed "critical", i.e. likely to reach thermal or clearance limits first, are monitored in real-time, providing data on their status with respect to safety limits. The state change equation of the conductor, using its thermal features (absorptivity, emissivity) converts data on span geometry into valid temperature data for the "ruling span" of the monitored section. If weather conditions are more favorable than those used for the calculation of static limits, a margin probably exists. To be able to provide reliable and safe values, real-time parameters (load current, conductor temperature, weather parameters) are fed into the conductor's thermal model as per IEEE and CIGRÉ guidelines. Measurements, software and specialized algorithms are housed in a dedicated computer set up, forming a "DLR server", with communication facilities. After processing and formatting, "ratings" are made available to human operators via a user interface (computer displays and data files). Several kinds of ratings are available, from real-time, indicating ampacity immediately available, without time limits should conditions remain identical, to emergency ratings (higher ratings for a limited duration), to same-day or day-ahead forecasts, using sophisticated mathematical techniques and ever-improving Machine Learning algorithms.

Note 1: DLR computations deal with "near real-time" data, i.e. information updated more or less every 5 minutes. Shorter time cycles would require uneconomical computing power and would not make sense because of the thermal inertia of power transit phenomena. Furthermore, in current applications, DLR involves human-made decisions in control rooms of electrical utility companies, without automation.

Note 2: Weather parameters affect line ratings in decreasing order, as follows:
*wind is the most important factor (reference neded)
*ambient temperature (reference needed)
*solar radiation (reference needed)
*rain is not taken into account by standards (as of June 2018).

Standards published by [[IEEE]] and [[CIGRE|CIGRÉ]] cover the following subjects, necessary to perform DLR:
*on conductors and thermal ratings: Thermal behavior of overhead conductors (TB207), Rating of overhead conductors (TB299, TB601), Thermal modelling of overhead conductors (IEEE738)
*on dynamic line rating specifically (TB498).

==Integration into control room processes==
DLR translates into benefits when dispatch engineers apply optimized ratings to transit operations from their national or regional control center. Stand-alone DLR solutions provide real-time data for day-to-day operations and historical data for statistical analysis. The ultimate destination of a DLR solution is integration into control room tools and systems. Typically, the DLR server can be configured to send standard telecontrol frames to the electric utility's [[scada]] front-end acquisition units. These frames can then be processed for display and calculations by the utility [[energy management system]] or [[distribution management system]]. Short-term network operation decisions are based on optimized rating information, as well as load-flow calculations and economic dispatch scenarios. The latter also benefit from short-term forecasts in contingency analysis.

==Communications, IT and cybersecurity considerations==
Input data (weather parameters, circuit load, infrastructure design, field measurements) are public domain, proprietary if not confidential, and must be managed accordingly. Output data (line condition, ratings and forecasts) are definitely proprietary and confidential. To ensure provisions of the [[CIA triad]], the utility and the vendor implement secured communications with cyphering, access control and restrictions. Industry trends favor deployments in [[SaaS]] (Software as a service) mode. Sensitive areas are:
*communications between field devices and data concentrator (most likely an IT setup comprising a data server)
*protection of the data and software (firewalls and anti-virus against unwanted access and malware)
*uptime commitments through redundancy strategies.

==Fossil fuel consumption==
In the first half of 2016, Thailand imported 11.13 million [[tonne]]s of coal, up 3.5 percent from 10.76 million metric tonnes (mt) in the first half of 2015. Indonesia and Australia supplied 5.6 million tonnes of [[bituminous coal]] and 5.5 million tonnes of "other" coal. China and Russia supplied 47,395 tonnes of [[anthracite coal]]. Thailand produced 6.88 million mt of lignite from January-May 2016, rising 7.5 percent from the same period in 2015. EGAT accounts for "...most of the country's domestic lignite production, which is mainly supplied to its own power plants."&lt;ref name=Platts-20160728&gt;{{cite news|title=Thailand's June coal imports slide 6% on year to 1.82 million mt|url=http://www.platts.com/latest-news/coal/hanoi/thailands-june-coal-imports-slide-6-on-year-to-27635975|accessdate=29 July 2016|work=S&amp;P Global Platts|date=28 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coal-fired power plants consumed 10.31 million mt of coal and lignite from January to May 2016, or 60.9 percent of the total, rising 11.4 percent year on year.&lt;ref name=Platts-20160728/&gt; 

In 2017, Thailand imported 22.18 million mt of coal, up 2.5 percent from 2016. The nation produced 16.26 million mt of lignite in 2017, down 4.2 percent year on year. The country consumed a total of 39.07 million mt of coal and lignite, up 0.9 percent. Coal-fired power plants consumed 23.73 million mt of the total, down 4.2 percent from 2016. Other industries consumed the remainder.&lt;ref name="Platts-20180223"&gt;{{cite news|title=Thailand's Jan coal imports rise 22% on year to 1.6 mil mt|url=https://www.platts.com/latest-news/coal/hanoi/thailands-jan-coal-imports-rise-22-on-year-to-27917422|accessdate=8 May 2018|work=S&amp;P Global Platts|date=2018-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

While EGAT pushes forward with plans for coal-fired generating plants, many countries are spurning coal or deferring its use:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Romm|first1=Joe|title=Energy experts give Trump the hard truth: You can’t bring coal back|url=https://thinkprogress.org/coal-wont-rebound-whatever-president-trump-does-energy-experts-say-e30a78745b77#.975tcqhas|accessdate=11 February 2017|work=ThinkProgress|date=10 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* China in 2016 announced the suspension of plans for 100 new coal plants, including plants under construction.
* India's Electricity Central Electricity Authority has said that after coal-fired power plants under construction are completed, the country will need no new ones until 2027.

==Thailand Power Development Plan 2015-2036 (PDP2025)==
Guiding EGAT's efforts is Thailand's Power Development Plan (PDP).&lt;ref name="PDP2015"&gt;{{cite book|title=Thailand Power Development Plan 2015-2036 (PDP2015)|date=2015-06-30|publisher=Ministry of Energy (MOE), Energy Policy and Planning Office (EPPO)|location=Bangkok|url=http://www.egat.co.th/en/images/about-egat/PDP2015_Eng.pdf|accessdate=30 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The plan, prepared by the Ministry of Energy (MOE) and EGAT, is issued iteratively. The previous edition, PDP2010 Revision 3, covered the years 2012-2030.

Along with the PDP, the MOE produces several subsidiary plans that roll up into the PDP:&lt;ref name="PDP2015" /&gt;{{RP|1-1}}
* Energy Efficiency Development Plan (EEDP)
* Alternative Energy Development Plan (AEDP)
* Natural Gas Supply Plan 
* Petroleum Management Plan

PDP2015 begins with the assumptions that:&lt;ref name="PDP2015" /&gt;{{RP|2-3}}
* Thailand's average [[GDP]] growth over the period 2014-2036 will be 3.94 percent annually
* Thailand's population growth over the same period will average 0.03 percent annually
* Energy savings over the period as forecasted in the EEDP will total 89,672 GWh
* Renewables, including domestic hydro, will supply 19,634.4 MW of power over the period
* Thailand's new power demands will grow 2.67 percent annually, 2014-2036
* In 2036 Thailand's peak electricity demand will be 49,655 MW and that total electricity demand will be 326,119 GWh

PDP2015 projects the following changes in Thailand electrical power generation fuel mix over the period 2014-2036:&lt;ref name="PDP2015" /&gt;{{RP|2-1}}
* Imported hydro-power: Rising from 7 percent in 2014 to 15-20 percent in 2036
* Coal/lignite: Flat to rising from 20 percent to 20-25 percent. EGAT appears to be insistent on building coal-fired plants&lt;ref name="TPBS-20180210"&gt;{{cite news|title=EGAT told to find new sites for coal-fired power plant projects|url=http://englishnews.thaipbs.or.th/egat-told-find-new-sites-coal-fired-power-plant-projects/|accessdate=11 February 2018|work=Thai PBS|date=2018-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; regardless of the changing economics of power generation.&lt;ref name="NYT-20180208"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gillis|first1=Justin|last2=Harvey|first2=Hal|title=Why a Big Utility Is Embracing Wind and Solar|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/06/opinion/utility-embracing-wind-solar.html|accessdate=11 February 2018|work=New York Times|date=2018-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Renewables, including domestic hydro: Rising from 8 percent to 15-20 percent
* Natural gas: Declining from 64 percent to 30-40 percent
* Nuclear: Rising from 0 percent to 0-5 percent
* Diesel/fuel oil: Declining from 1 percent to zero

PDP2015 projects that Thailand's CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions from power generation will rise from 86,998,000 tons in 2015 to 104,075,000 tons in 2036.&lt;ref name="PDP2015" /&gt;{{RP|7-1}}

Thailand's newest power development plan, PDP2018, is expected to be issued in September 2018.&lt;ref name="Nation-20180625" /&gt;

==Reserve capacity concerns==
Several critics have pointed out that EGAT's in-house generating capacity coupled with its power purchases from other suppliers has resulted in excessive reserve capacity. One such critic has been the editorial board of the ''Bangkok Post''. They point out that in May 2017, Thailand's peak power demand was 28,578 MW. Total EGAT installed and purchased power capacity in May 2017 was 41,903 MW, leaving a reserve power capacity of 13,325 MW, 46 percent of total May demand. Industry standard best practice is that a 15 percent reserve power capacity is sufficient to "...maintain a stable power supply."&lt;ref name="BP-20170828" /&gt; In July 2017, EGAT generated 16,071 MW and purchased 25,652 MW from other suppliers for a total of 41,723 MW.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=System Installed Generating Capacity|url=https://www.egat.co.th/en/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=80&amp;Itemid=116|website=Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand (EGAT)|accessdate=28 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Updated figures reported in June 2018 indicate that Thailand has the capacity to produce or purchase 42,547 megawatts. Peak demand as of 31 April 2018 was recorded at 29,968 megawatts. Thus Thailand has a reserve margin of 58 percent. The "internationally accepted ideal reserve margin...[is] 15 percent of peak demand."&lt;ref name="Nation-20180625" /&gt;

==Plans and protests==
EGAT continues to press forward with plans to construct six new coal-fired power plants by 2025&lt;ref name="BP-20160630" /&gt; in spite of institutions such as the [[World Bank]] halting funding for new coal projects except in "rare circumstances". Rachel Kyte, the World Bank climate change envoy, said continued use of coal was exacting a heavy cost on some of the world's poorest countries, in local health impacts as well as climate change, which is imposing even graver consequences on the developing world. "In general globally we need to wean ourselves off coal,...There is a huge social cost to coal and a huge social cost to fossil fuels...if you want to be able to breathe clean air."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Goldenberg|first1=Suzanne|title=World Bank rejects energy industry notion that coal can cure poverty|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/jul/29/world-bank-coal-cure-poverty-rejects|accessdate=31 July 2015|work=The Guardian|date=2015-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; EGAT "...has—in TV commercials—ridiculed renewable energy as expensive and insufficient to deal with rising electricity demand."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kongrut|first1=Anchalee|title=Bringing climate change policy into the 21st century |url=http://www.bangkokpost.com/opinion/opinion/647888/bringing-climate-change-policy-into-the-21st-century|accessdate=7 August 2015|work=Bangkok Post|date=2015-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A persistent criticism of EGAT is that it has paid scant attention to the demand side of the energy equation. Rather than build more carbon-powered plants, working to reduce demand and use existing supplies more efficiently has taken a back seat to network expansion.&lt;ref name="BP-20160706"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Marks|first1=Danny|title=No more coal power plants needed|url=http://www.bangkokpost.com/opinion/opinion/1028837/no-more-coal-power-plants-needed|accessdate=6 July 2016|work=Bangkok Post|date=6 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Opportunities for big savings exist: on 29 March 2014, Thailand observed "Earth Hour." For one hour, superfluous lighting was turned off, resulting in a savings of 1,778 megawatts, the energy equivalent of a new power plant, and more than six million baht in power bills.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Deboonme|first1=Achara|title=The illusions clouding Thailand's energy outlook|url=http://www.nationmultimedia.com/opinion/The-illusions-clouding-Thailands-energy-outlook-30230558.html|accessdate=31 July 2015|work=The Nation|date=2014-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

EGAT's plans for future developments have been dogged by protests by local residents:

===Krabi power plant===
In mid-2015, government plans to build an 800 [[megawatt]] coal-fired electricity generating station (EGAT Coal-Fired TH #3)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Summary of Thailand Power Development Plan 2012 – 2030 (PDP2010: Rev 3)|url=http://www.egat.co.th/en/images/about-egat/PDP2010-Rev3-Eng.pdf|website=Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand (EGAT)|publisher=Ministry of Energy, Energy Policy and Planning Office|accessdate=22 July 2015|page=13|date=June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|13}} in [[Krabi Province]] have generated protests and hunger strikes by those opposed to the plant who say that it would endanger Krabi's relatively pristine environment. EGAT has pushed forward with development despite not having completed an environmental impact study. It intends to start the bidding process without an environmental assessment in order to "save time". The Krabi site is one of nine coal-fired plants planned for southern Thailand to be constructed over the next two decades to off-set the depletion of natural gas fields in the [[Gulf of Thailand]]. Opponents of the plan say their demands—which include a three-year waiting period to see if the province can produce 100 percent renewable energy—have been ignored.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Andersen|first1=Ted|title=Hunger strikes, protests to oppose Thailand's plan for coal plants on Andaman Coast|url=https://www.usnews.com/news/world/articles/2015/07/21/coal-plant-proposed-for-pristine-thai-coast-sparks-outcry|accessdate=22 July 2015|work=U.S. News &amp; World Report|agency=Associated Press|date=2015-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2015, the prime minister ordered the formation of a commission composed of state agencies, EGAT, and citizen activists to find solutions to the power plant conflict. Gen Sakon Sajjanit was appointed committee chairman. It was agreed that the government put a hold on consideration of the Environmental Impact Assessment and Environmental Health Impact Assessments; that EGAT postpone bidding for the plant and the seaport; and that all parties allow Krabi to try to produce 100 percent renewable energy for three years with government support. EGAT broke the agreement as it proceeded with the bidding process, won by the Power Construction Corporation of China&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Us|url=http://en.powerchina.cn/2016-02/26/content_16651992.htm|website=Power Construction Corporation of China.|accessdate=25 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Italian-Thai Development PCL.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Home page|url=http://www.itd.co.th/|website=Italian-Thai Development Company PCL|accessdate=25 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2016, Prime Minister [[Prayut Chan-o-cha]] put the project "on-hold". According to the ''Bangkok Post'', this is a move to "buy time".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Government's smoke and mirrors|url=http://www.bangkokpost.com/opinion/opinion/1143929/governments-smoke-and-mirrors|accessdate=25 November 2016|work=Bangkok Post|date=25 November 2016|format=Editorial}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early-2017, following a series of protests by those opposed to a coal-fired plant in Krabi, Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha ordered that new environmental (EIA) and health impact assessments (EHIA) be conducted for the Krabi project. He directed that the public must be allowed to have its say. "A new power plant will certainly be built, but how? We have to take a look at what is good, safe and can deal with power shortages in order to ensure power security. There must be a balance between fossil fuels and recyclable energy," the prime minister said. The new assessments are expected to take at least two and a half years to complete, which means the Krabi power plant will be delayed to 2024 from its original schedule of 2019. EGAT officials insisted that a new power plant is still needed in south Thailand to meet the region's power demands, which increase by four to five percent annually.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Krabi coal plant to start anew|url=http://www.bangkokpost.com/news/politics/1206529/krabi-coal-plant-to-start-anew|accessdate=1 March 2017|work=Bangkok Post|date=1 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2018 the Ministry of Energy put the Krabi coal-fired power plant "on hold" for three years pending additional EHIA (environmental and health impact assessment) and EIA (environmental impact assessment) studies.&lt;ref name="TPBS-20180203"&gt;{{cite news|title=Coal-fired power plant projects in Krabi and Thepa put off for 3 years|url=http://englishnews.thaipbs.or.th/coal-fired-power-plant-projects-krabi-thepa-put-off-3-years/|accessdate=11 February 2018|work=Thai PBS|date=2018-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Thepha power plant===
In [[Songkhla Province]]'s [[Thepha District]], a public hearing on EGAT's plans to build a coal-fired plant was ringed with razor wire to prevent opponents of the plan from gaining access to the hearing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Razor wire rings Thepha power plant hearing|url=http://www.bangkokpost.com/news/general/635844/razor-wire-rings-thepha-power-plant-hearing|accessdate=28 July 2015|work=Bangkok Post|date=2015-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hearing, the third and final hearing on the Environment and Health Impact Assessment (EHIA) for the 2,400 megawatt plant, was policed by 400 soldiers, police, and volunteers. Some attendees admitted being transported to the hearing by local village leaders, who also provided them with gifts and food coupons. Songkhla Governor Thamrong Charoenkul chaired the hearing despite questions raised regarding his neutrality. He told the hearing that the project will benefit Thepa residents. "Since Egat has proposed the project, Thepha is now known nationwide. Shouldn't we be proud about that?" he said. Anuchart Palakawongse Na Ayudhya, director of EGAT's Project Environment Division, insisted EGAT's hearings were lawful. "We have organised the public review step by step according to the law," he said. Anuchart said EGAT did not bar anyone from expressing their opinions. "It's impossible to cancel the project. Most Thepha people support it," he said.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wangkiat|first1=Paritta|title=Protesters shun power plant hearing| url=http://www.bangkokpost.com/news/general/636188/protesters-shun-power-plant-hearing|accessdate=28 July 2015|work=Bangkok Post|date=2015-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 17 August 2017, an expert committee of the Natural Resources and Environmental Policy and Planning Office (ONEP) approved the 2,200-megawatt coal-fired power plant's EHIA, removing one of the last hurdles to the plant's construction. The EHIA's approval was met with renewed criticism. The ''Bangkok Post'' commented that, "These...assessments turn out to be just another rubber stamp for operators — in this case...EGAT...."&lt;ref name=BP-20170828&gt;{{cite news|title=Going full steam ahead| url=http://www.bangkokpost.com/opinion/opinion/1314055/going-full-steam-ahead|accessdate=28 August 2017|work=Bangkok Post|date=28 August 2017|format=Editorial}}&lt;/ref&gt; ONEP responded to criticism by defending its approval.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Reviewers defend decision to approve Thepa plant EHIA report|url=http://www.nationmultimedia.com/detail/national/30325170|accessdate=30 August 2017|work=The Nation|date=29 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A construction schedule has not yet been published.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Rujivanarom|first1=Pratch|title=Power plant approval branded unjust| url=http://www.nationmultimedia.com/detail/national/30324329|accessdate=20 August 2017|work=The Nation|date=20 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2018 the Ministry of Energy put the Thepha coal-fired power plant "on hold" for three years pending additional EHIA (environmental and health impact assessment) and EIA (environmental impact assessment) studies.&lt;ref name="TPBS-20180203"/&gt;

===Salween River projects===
Thailand's Power Development Plan, approved in May 2015 (PDP 2015), outlines the government's plans to import up to 10,000 MW of electricity from [[Myanmar]] over the next two decades. Much of this electricity is expected to come from planned hydro-power projects on the [[Salween River]] ("Thanlwin" in Myanmar). Thailand and Myanmar have signed an agreement for the Salween dams project, five dams on the Salween and another dam on the [[Tenasserim River]]. EGAT has been pushing forward two projects: the 1,360 MW Hatgyi dam in [[Kayin State]] and the 7,100 MW Mong Ton dam in [[Shan State]] (formerly known as the Tasang dam).The Mong Ton dam, in central Shan State, would span the Salween and Pang rivers, covering an area the size of [[Singapore]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Deetes|first1=Pianporn|title=Visit is chance to rethink investments|url=http://www.bangkokpost.com/news/asean/1017569/visit-is-chance-to-rethink-investments|accessdate=25 June 2016|work=Bangkok Post|date=23 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Litigation==
EGAT has been the target of several lawsuits brought by neighbours of several of its operations. The best known legal challenge took place in [[Mae Mo District|Mae Mo]]. Mae Mo is the site of a 2,400 MW lignite-fueled power plant run by EGAT.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mae Moh Power Plant|url=http://www.egat.co.th/en/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=36&amp;Itemid=117|website=EGAT|accessdate=28 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coal-fired power plants such as Mae Mo can release up to 150 million [[tonne]]s of [[carbon dioxide|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] over their design life of 20–25 years, according to Greenpeace-Thailand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Rujivanarom|first1=Pratch|title=Experts urge people to help climate-change mitigation as big goals loom|url=http://www.nationmultimedia.com/news/national/30300855|accessdate=26 November 2016|work=The Nation|date=26 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The plant has been the target of a series of lawsuits brought by locals who claim that the lignite mining operation and the burning of lignite fuel by EGAT has negatively impacted the environment and the health of those living in the vicinity. A 12-year fight by villagers for compensation for damages ended in victory for the plaintiffs in February 2015. The Supreme Administrative Court in Chiang Mai Province upheld a ruling by the Chiang Mai Administrative Court in 2005. The court handed down a verdict ordering EGAT to pay compensation to 131 plaintiffs, some of them deceased. Plant victims were awarded between 20,000-240,000 baht each, commensurate with their suffering. The total amounts to 25 million baht plus 7.5 percent interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sattha|first1=Cheewin|title=Victory for Mae Moh victims|url=http://www.bangkokpost.com/news/general/483656/victory-for-mae-moh-victims|accessdate=28 July 2015|work=Bangkok Post|date=2015-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several days earlier, the court had ordered EGAT to return its Mae Mo golf course, adjacent to the open pit lignite mine, to woodland in order to help clean up the air pollution caused by EGAT's Mae Mo operations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Mae Moh golf course to be destroyed   |url=http://www.bangkokpost.com/news/general/471658/egat-must-give-up-mae-moh-golf-course|accessdate=28 July 2015|work=Bangkok Post|date=2015-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ferricyanide''' is the [[anion]] [Fe(CN)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;3−&lt;/sup&gt;.&amp;nbsp; It is also called '''hexacyanoferrate(III)''' and in rare, but [[systematic name|systematic nomenclature]], hexacyanidoferrate(III). The most common salt of this anion is [[potassium ferricyanide]], a red crystalline material that is used as an [[oxidant]] in [[organic chemistry]].&lt;ref name=Ullmann&gt;{{ cite encyclopedia |author1=Gail, E. |author2=Gos, S. |author3=Kulzer, R. |author4=Lorösch, J. |author5=Rubo, A. |author6=Sauer, M. |author7=Kellens, R. |author8=Reddy, J. |author9=Steier, N. |author10=Hasenpusch, W. | title = Cyano Compounds, Inorganic | encyclopedia = Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry |date=October 2011 | publisher = Wiley-VCH | location = Weinheim | doi = 10.1002/14356007.a08_159.pub3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Properties ==
[Fe(CN)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;3−&lt;/sup&gt; consists of a Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; center bound in [[octahedral geometry]] to six [[cyanide]] [[ligand]]s. The complex has O&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt; [[symmetry group|symmetry]]. The iron is [[low spin]] and easily reduced to the related [[ferrocyanide]] ion [Fe(CN)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;4−&lt;/sup&gt;, which is a ferrous (Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;) derivative. This redox couple is reversible and entails no making or breaking of Fe-C bonds:
:[Fe(CN)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;3−&lt;/sup&gt;  +  e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;  &amp;rarr;  [Fe(CN)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;4−&lt;/sup&gt;
This [[redox couple]] is a standard in [[electrochemistry]].

Compared to normal [[cyanide]]s like [[potassium cyanide]], ferricyanides are much less toxic because of the tight hold of the CN&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;&lt;/sup&gt; to the Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;. They do react with mineral acids, however, to release highly toxic [[hydrogen cyanide]] gas.

== Uses ==
Treatment of ferricyanide with ferrous (Iron (II)) salts affords the brilliant, long-lasting pigment [[Prussian blue]], the traditional color of [[blueprints]].

The '''Fürstenwalde Solar Park''' is a [[photovoltaic power station]] in [[Fürstenwalde]], Germany.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pvresources.com/PVPowerPlants/Top50.aspx Large-Scale Photovoltaic Power Plants] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160101000000/http://www.pvresources.com/PVPowerPlants/Top50.aspx |date=January 1, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has a capacity of 39.64&amp;nbsp;[[megawatt]] (MW) and an annual output of 36.5&amp;nbsp;[[GWh]]. The solar park was developed by the company ''Solarhybrid'' and built by conecon using 62,832 225-watt and 110,880 230-watt [[solar panels]], both manufactured by Suntech.

The PV project was built on a former military airfield on {{convert|89|ha}}, and was completed in 10 weeks only.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pv-tech.org/news/work_begins_on_solarhybrids_40mw_fuerstenwalde_park Work begins on solarhybrid’s 40MW Fürstenwalde park]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.solarhybrid.ag/ref_fuerstenwalde.html?L=2 Fürstenwalde]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Habitat selection hypothesis''' is an attempt to explain the mechanisms of [[brood parasite]] nest selection in cuckoos. [[Cuckoo]]s are not the only brood parasites, however the behavior is more rare in other groups of birds, including ducks, weavers, and cowbirds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://web.stanford.edu/group/stanfordbirds/text/essays/Brood_Parasitism.html|title=Brood Parasitism|website=web.stanford.edu|access-date=2017-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; In habitat selection hypothesis, a female cuckoo retains recognition (is [[Imprinting (psychology)|imprinted]]) of the [[habitat]] type in which she was reared, and will subsequently return to this habitat type in order to lay eggs. Habitat might be defined as dry or wet, [[shrub]]by or forested, lakeside, etc. This habitat preference increases the likelihood of encountering the suitable [[host species]], as most host species are known to be habitat specific. Thus, habitat selection is thought to allow for random host selection by the female cuckoo (Teuschl et al. 1998; Vogl et al. 2002). In some cases an individual may choose a different habitat from their original recognition based on the [[reproductive success]] of other individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Danchin|first=Etienne|last2=Boulinier|first2=Thierry|last3=Massot|first3=Manuel|date=1998-10-01|title=Conspecific Reproductive Success and Breeding Habitat Selection: Implications for the Study of Coloniality|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1890/0012-9658(1998)079[2415:CRSABH]2.0.CO;2/abstract|journal=Ecology|language=en|volume=79|issue=7|pages=2415–2428|doi=10.1890/0012-9658(1998)079[2415:CRSABH]2.0.CO;2|issn=1939-9170}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''heat exchanger''' is a device used to transfer heat between two or more fluids. In other words, heat exchangers are used in both cooling and heating processes.&lt;ref&gt;Ahmed T. Al-Sammarraie &amp; Kambiz Vafai (2017) Heat transfer augmentation through convergence angles in a pipe, Numerical Heat Transfer, Part A: Applications, 72:3, 197-214, http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10407782.2017.1372670&lt;/ref&gt; The fluids may be separated by a solid wall to prevent mixing or they may be in direct contact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Sadik Kakaç |author2=Hongtan Liu |title=Heat Exchangers: Selection, Rating and Thermal Design|edition=2nd|publisher=CRC Press|year=2002|isbn=0-8493-0902-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are widely used in [[space heating]], [[refrigeration]], [[air conditioning]], [[power station]]s, [[chemical plant]]s, [[Petrochemical|petrochemical plants]], [[Oil refinery|petroleum refineries]], [[natural-gas processing]], and [[sewage treatment]]. The classic example of a heat exchanger is found in an [[internal combustion engine]] in which a circulating fluid known as [[engine coolant]] flows through [[radiator]] coils and [[air]] flows past the coils, which cools the coolant and heats the incoming [[air]]. Another example is the [[heat sink]], which is a passive heat exchanger that transfers the heat generated by an electronic or a mechanical device to a fluid medium, often air or a liquid coolant.&lt;ref&gt;Salimpour, M. R., Al-Sammarraie, A. T., Forouzandeh, A., &amp; Farzaneh, M. (2019). Constructal design of circular multilayer microchannel heat sinks.

==Flow arrangement==

Image:Heat_exc_1-1.svg|Fig. 1: [[Shell and tube heat exchanger]], single pass (1–1 parallel flow)
Image:Heat_exc_2-1.png|Fig. 2: Shell and tube heat exchanger, 2-pass tube side (1–2 crossflow)
Image:Heat_exc_2-2.png|Fig. 3: Shell and tube heat exchanger, 2-pass shell side, 2-pass tube side (2-2 countercurrent)
&lt;/gallery&gt;

There are three primary classifications of heat exchangers according to their flow arrangement. In ''parallel-flow'' heat exchangers, the two fluids enter the exchanger at the same end, and travel in parallel to one another to the other side. In ''counter-flow'' heat exchangers the fluids enter the exchanger from opposite ends. The counter current design is the most efficient, in that it can transfer the most heat from the heat (transfer) medium per unit mass due to the fact that the average temperature difference along any unit length is ''higher''. See [[countercurrent exchange]]. In a ''cross-flow'' heat exchanger, the fluids travel roughly perpendicular to one another through the exchanger.

For efficiency, heat exchangers are designed to maximize the surface area of the wall between the two fluids, while minimizing resistance to fluid flow through the exchanger. The exchanger's performance can also be affected by the addition of fins or corrugations in one or both directions, which increase surface area and may channel fluid flow or induce turbulence.

The driving temperature across the heat transfer surface varies with position, but an appropriate mean temperature can be defined. In most simple systems this is the "[[log mean temperature difference]]" (LMTD). Sometimes direct knowledge of the LMTD is not available and the [[NTU method]] is used.

==Types==
Double pipe heat exchangers are the simplest exchangers used in industries. On one hand, these heat exchangers are cheap for both design and maintenance, making them a good choice for small industries. On the other hand, their low efficiency coupled with the high space occupied in large scales, has led modern industries to use more efficient heat exchangers like shell and tube or plate. However, since double pipe heat exchangers are simple, they are used to teach heat exchanger design basics to students as the fundamental rules for all heat exchangers are the same. 

===Shell and tube heat exchanger ===
[[Image:Straight-tube heat exchanger 1-pass.PNG|thumb|right|A shell and tube heat exchanger]]
{{Main article|Shell and tube heat exchanger}}
Shell and tube heat exchangers consist of series of tubes. One set of these tubes contains the fluid that must be either heated or cooled. The second fluid runs over the tubes that are being heated or cooled so that it can either provide the heat or absorb the heat required. A set of tubes is called the tube bundle and can be made up of several types of tubes: plain, longitudinally finned, etc. Shell and tube heat exchangers are typically used for high-pressure applications (with pressures greater than 30 bar and temperatures greater than 260&amp;nbsp;°C).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Saunders, E. A. (1988). Heat Exchanges: Selection, Design and Construction. New York: Longman Scientific and Technical.&lt;/ref&gt; This is because the shell and tube heat exchangers are robust due to their shape.&lt;br&gt;Several thermal design features must be considered when designing the tubes in the shell and tube heat exchangers:
There can be many variations on the shell and tube design. Typically, the ends of each tube are connected to plenums (sometimes called water boxes) through holes in tubesheets. The tubes may be straight or bent in the shape of a U, called U-tubes.
* Tube diameter: Using a small tube diameter makes the heat exchanger both economical and compact. However, it is more likely for the heat exchanger to foul up faster and the small size makes mechanical cleaning of the fouling difficult. To prevail over the fouling and cleaning problems, larger tube diameters can be used. Thus to determine the tube diameter, the available space, cost and fouling nature of the fluids must be considered.
* Tube thickness: The thickness of the wall of the tubes is usually determined to ensure:
** There is enough room for corrosion
** That flow-induced vibration has resistance
** Axial strength
** Availability of spare parts
** Hoop strength (to withstand internal tube pressure)
** Buckling strength (to withstand overpressure in the shell)
* Tube length: heat exchangers are usually cheaper when they have a smaller shell diameter and a long tube length. Thus, typically there is an aim to make the heat exchanger as long as physically possible whilst not exceeding production capabilities. However, there are many limitations for this, including space available at the installation site and the need to ensure tubes are available in lengths that are twice the required length (so they can be withdrawn and replaced). Also, long, thin tubes are difficult to take out and replace.
* Tube pitch: when designing the tubes, it is practical to ensure that the tube pitch (i.e., the centre-centre distance of adjoining tubes) is not less than 1.25 times the tubes' outside diameter. A larger tube pitch leads to a larger overall shell diameter, which leads to a more expensive heat exchanger.
* Tube corrugation: this type of tubes, mainly used for the inner tubes, increases the turbulence of the fluids and the effect is very important in the heat transfer giving a better performance.
*Tube Layout: refers to how tubes are positioned within the shell. There are four main types of tube layout, which are, triangular (30°), rotated triangular (60°), square (90°) and rotated square (45°). The triangular patterns are employed to give greater heat transfer as they force the fluid to flow in a more turbulent fashion around the piping. Square patterns are employed where high fouling is experienced and cleaning is more regular.
*Baffle Design: [[Baffle (heat exchanger)|baffles]] are used in shell and tube heat exchangers to direct fluid across the tube bundle. They run perpendicularly to the shell and hold the bundle, preventing the tubes from sagging over a long length. They can also prevent the tubes from vibrating. The most common type of baffle is the segmental baffle. The semicircular segmental baffles are oriented at 180 degrees to the adjacent baffles forcing the fluid to flow upward and downwards between the tube bundle. Baffle spacing is of large thermodynamic concern when designing shell and tube heat exchangers. Baffles must be spaced with consideration for the conversion of pressure drop and heat transfer. For thermo economic optimization it is suggested that the baffles be spaced no closer than 20% of the shell’s inner diameter. Having baffles spaced too closely causes a greater pressure drop because of flow redirection. Consequently, having the baffles spaced too far apart means that there may be cooler spots in the corners between baffles. It is also important to ensure the baffles are spaced close enough that the tubes do not sag. The other main type of baffle is the disc and doughnut baffle, which consists of two concentric baffles. An outer, wider baffle looks like a doughnut, whilst the inner baffle is shaped like a disk. This type of baffle forces the fluid to pass around each side of the disk then through the doughnut baffle generating a different type of fluid flow.

Fixed tube liquid-cooled heat exchangers especially suitable for marine and harsh applications can be assembled with brass shells, copper tubes, brass baffles, and forged brass integral end hubs.&lt;ref&gt;Industrial Shell-and-tube heat exchangers; American Industrial Heat Transfer Inc.; http://www.aihti.com/pdf/fbf.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; ''(See: [[Copper in heat exchangers]]).''

===Plate heat exchangers===
{{Main article|Plate heat exchanger}}
Another type of heat exchanger is the [[plate heat exchanger]]. These exchangers are composed of many thin, slightly separated plates that have very large surface areas and small fluid flow passages for heat transfer.  Advances in [[gasket]] and [[brazing]] technology have made the plate-type heat exchanger increasingly practical. In [[HVAC]] applications, large heat exchangers of this type are called ''plate-and-frame''; when used in open loops, these heat exchangers are normally of the gasket type to allow periodic disassembly, cleaning, and inspection. There are many types of permanently bonded plate heat exchangers, such as dip-brazed, vacuum-brazed, and welded plate varieties, and they are often specified for closed-loop applications such as [[refrigeration]]. Plate heat exchangers also differ in the types of plates that are used, and in the configurations of those plates. Some plates may be stamped with "chevron", dimpled, or other patterns, where others may have machined fins and/or grooves.

When compared to shell and tube exchangers, the stacked-plate arrangement typically has lower volume and cost. Another difference between the two is that plate exchangers typically serve low to medium pressure fluids, compared to medium and high pressures of shell and tube.  A third and important difference is that plate exchangers employ more countercurrent flow rather than cross current flow, which allows lower approach temperature differences, high temperature changes, and increased efficiencies.

===Plate and shell heat exchanger===
A third type of heat exchanger is a plate and shell heat exchanger, which combines plate heat exchanger with shell and tube heat exchanger technologies. The heart of the heat exchanger contains a fully welded circular plate pack made by pressing and cutting round plates and welding them together. Nozzles carry flow in and out of the platepack (the 'Plate side' flowpath). The fully welded platepack is assembled into an outer shell that creates a second flowpath ( the 'Shell side'). Plate and shell technology offers high heat transfer, high pressure, high [[operating temperature]], uling and close approach temperature. In particular, it does completely without gaskets, which provides security against leakage at high pressures and temperatures.

===Adiabatic wheel heat exchanger===
A fourth type of heat exchanger uses an intermediate fluid or solid store to hold heat, which is then moved to the other side of the heat exchanger to be released. Two examples of this are adiabatic wheels, which consist of a large wheel with fine threads rotating through the hot and cold fluids, and fluid heat exchangers.

===Plate fin heat exchanger===
{{Main article|Plate fin heat exchanger}}
This type of heat exchanger uses "sandwiched" passages containing fins to increase the effectiveness of the unit. The designs include crossflow and counterflow coupled with various fin configurations such as straight fins, offset fins and wavy fins.

Plate and fin heat exchangers are usually made of aluminum alloys, which provide high heat transfer efficiency. The material enables the system to operate at a lower temperature difference and reduce the weight of the equipment. Plate and fin heat exchangers are mostly used for low temperature services such as natural gas, [[helium]] and [[oxygen]] liquefaction plants, air separation plants and transport industries such as motor and [[aircraft engine]]s.

Advantages of plate and fin heat exchangers:
* High  heat transfer efficiency especially in gas treatment
* Larger heat transfer area
* Approximately 5 times lighter in weight than that of shell and tube heat exchanger.
* Able to withstand high pressure

Disadvantages of plate and fin heat exchangers:
* Might cause clogging as the pathways are very narrow
* Difficult to clean the pathways
* Aluminium alloys are susceptible to [[Liquid metal embrittlement#Mercury embrittlement|Mercury Liquid Embrittlement]] Failure

===Pillow plate heat exchanger===
A [[Pillowplate|pillow plate exchanger]] is commonly used in the dairy industry for cooling milk in large direct-expansion stainless steel [[bulk tank]]s. The pillow plate allows for cooling across nearly the entire surface area of the tank, without gaps that would occur between pipes welded to the exterior of the tank.

The pillow plate is constructed using a thin sheet of metal spot-welded to the surface of another thicker sheet of metal. The thin plate is welded in a regular pattern of dots or with a serpentine pattern of weld lines. After welding the enclosed space is pressurised with sufficient force to cause the thin metal to bulge out around the welds, providing a space for heat exchanger liquids to flow, and creating a characteristic appearance of a swelled pillow formed out of metal.

===Fluid heat exchangers===
This is a heat exchanger with a gas passing upwards through a shower of fluid (often water), and the fluid is then taken elsewhere before being cooled. This is commonly used for cooling gases whilst also removing certain impurities, thus solving two problems at once. It is widely used in espresso machines as an energy-saving method of cooling super-heated water to use in the extraction of espresso.

===Waste heat recovery units===
{{unsourced|section|date=March 2017}}
A [[waste heat recovery unit]] (WHRU) is a heat exchanger that recovers heat from a hot gas stream while transferring it to a working medium, typically water or oils. The hot gas stream can be the exhaust gas from a gas turbine or a diesel engine or a waste gas from industry or refinery.

Large systems with high volume and temperature gas streams, typical in industry, can benefit from steam [[Rankine cycle]] (SRC) in a waste heat recovery unit, but these cycles are too expensive for small systems.
The recovery of heat from low temperature systems requires different working fluids than steam.

An organic Rankine cycle (ORC) waste heat recovery unit can be more efficient at low temperature range using [[refrigerant]]s that boil at lower temperatures than water. Typical organic refrigerants are [[ammonia]], [[pentafluoropropane]] (R-245fa and R-245ca), and [[toluene]].

The refrigerant is boiled by the heat source in the [[evaporator]] to produce super-heated vapor. This fluid is expanded in the turbine to convert thermal energy to kinetic energy, that is converted to electricity in the electrical generator. This energy transfer process decreases the temperature of the refrigerant that, in turn, condenses. The cycle is closed and completed using a pump to send the fluid back to the evaporator.

===Dynamic scraped surface heat exchanger===
Another type of heat exchanger is called "[[Dynamic scraped surface heat exchanger|(dynamic) scraped surface heat exchanger]]". This is mainly used for heating or cooling with high-[[viscosity]] products, [[crystallization]] processes, [[evaporation]] and high-[[fouling]] applications. Long running times are achieved due to the continuous scraping of the surface, thus avoiding fouling and achieving a sustainable heat transfer rate during the process.

===Phase-change heat exchangers===
[[Image:Kettle reboiler.svg|thumb|right|250px|Typical kettle reboiler used for industrial distillation towers]]
[[Image:Surface Condenser.png|thumb|right|250px|Typical water-cooled surface condenser]]

In addition to heating up or cooling down fluids in just a single [[phase (matter)|phase]], heat exchangers can be used either to heat a [[liquid]] to evaporate (or boil) it or used as [[Condenser (heat transfer)|condensers]] to cool a [[vapor]] and [[Condensation|condense]] it to a liquid. In [[chemical plant]]s and [[Petroleum refinery|refineries]], [[reboiler]]s used to heat incoming feed for [[distillation]] towers are often heat exchangers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Kister, Henry Z.|title= [[Distillation Design]]|edition=1st |publisher=McGraw-Hill|year=1992|isbn=0-07-034909-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Perry, Robert H.  |author2=Green, Don W.|title=[[Perry's Chemical Engineers' Handbook]]|edition=6th| publisher=McGraw-Hill|year=1984|isbn=0-07-049479-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Distillation set-ups typically use condensers to condense distillate vapors back into liquid.

[[Power plant]]s that use [[steam]]-driven [[turbine]]s commonly use heat exchangers to boil [[water]] into [[steam]]. Heat exchangers or similar units for producing steam from water are often called [[boiler]]s or steam generators.

In the nuclear power plants called [[pressurized water reactor]]s, special large heat exchangers pass heat from the primary (reactor plant) system to the secondary (steam plant) system, producing steam from water in the process. These are called [[Steam generator (nuclear power)|steam generators]]. All fossil-fueled and nuclear power plants using steam-driven turbines have [[surface condenser]]s to convert the exhaust steam from the turbines into condensate (water) for re-use.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epa.gov/oar/oaqps/eog/course422/ce6b3.html Air Pollution Control Orientation Course] from website of the Air Pollution Training Institute&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://kolmetz.com/pdf/ENERGY%20EFFICIENCY%20IMPROVEMENT.pdf Energy savings in steam systems] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927225000/http://kolmetz.com/pdf/ENERGY%20EFFICIENCY%20IMPROVEMENT.pdf |date=2007-09-27 }} ''Figure 3a, Layout of surface condenser'' (scroll to page 11 of 34 PDF pages)&lt;/ref&gt;

To [[Energy conservation|conserve energy]] and [[cooling capacity]] in chemical and other plants, regenerative heat exchangers can transfer heat from a stream that must be cooled to another stream that must be heated, such as distillate cooling and reboiler feed pre-heating.

This term can also refer to heat exchangers that contain a material within their structure that has a change of phase. This is usually a solid to liquid phase due to the small volume difference between these states. This change of phase effectively acts as a buffer because it occurs at a constant temperature but still allows for the heat exchanger to accept additional heat. One example where this has been investigated is for use in high power aircraft electronics.

Heat exchangers functioning in multiphase flow regimes may be subject to the [[Ledinegg instability]].

===Direct contact heat exchangers===
Direct contact heat exchangers involve heat transfer between hot and cold streams of two phases in the absence of a separating wall.&lt;ref&gt;Coulson, J. &amp; Richardson, J. (1983), Chemical Engineering – Design (SI Units), Volume 6, Pergamon Press, Oxford.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus such heat exchangers can be classified as:
* Gas – liquid
* Immiscible liquid – liquid
* Solid-liquid or solid – gas

Most direct contact heat exchangers fall under the Gas – Liquid category, where heat is transferred between a gas and liquid in the form of drops, films or sprays.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Such types of heat exchangers are used predominantly in [[air conditioning]], [[humidification]], industrial hot water heating, [[water cooling]] and condensing plants.&lt;ref&gt;Hewitt G, Shires G, Bott T (1994), Process Heat Transfer, CRC Press Inc, Florida.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Microchannel heat exchangers ===
Microchannel heat exchangers are multi-pass parallel flow heat exchangers consisting of three main elements: manifolds (inlet and outlet), multi-port tubes with the hydraulic diameters smaller than 1mm, and fins. All the elements usually brazed together using controllable atmosphere brazing process. Microchannel heat exchangers are characterized by high heat transfer ratio, low refrigerant charges, compact size, and lower airside pressure drops compared to finned tube heat exchangers. Microchannel heat exchangers are widely used in automotive industry as the car radiators, and as condenser, evaporator, and cooling/heating coils in HVAC industry.{{Main article|Micro heat exchanger}}
'''Micro heat exchangers,''' '''Micro-scale heat exchangers,'''  or '''microstructured heat exchangers''' are heat exchangers in which (at least one) [[fluid]] flows in lateral confinements with typical dimensions below 1&amp;nbsp;mm. The most typical such confinement are [[microchannel heat exchanger|microchannels]], which are channels with a [[hydraulic diameter]] below 1&amp;nbsp;mm. Microchannel heat exchangers can be made from metal, ceramic,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Kee Robert J. | year = 2011 | title = The design, fabrication, and evaluation of a ceramic counter-flow microchannel heat exchanger | url = | journal = Applied Thermal Engineering | volume = 31 | issue = 11| pages = 2004–2012 | doi=10.1016/j.applthermaleng.2011.03.009|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Microchannel heat exchangers can be used for many applications including:

==HVAC air coils==
One of the widest uses of heat exchangers is for [[air conditioning]] of buildings and vehicles. This class of heat exchangers is commonly called ''air coils'', or just ''coils'' due to their often-serpentine internal tubing. Liquid-to-air, or air-to-liquid [[HVAC]] coils are typically of modified crossflow arrangement. In vehicles, heat coils are often called [[heater core]]s.

On the liquid side of these heat exchangers, the common fluids are water, a water-glycol solution, steam, or a [[refrigerant]]. For ''heating coils'', hot water and steam are the most common, and this heated fluid is supplied by [[boiler]]s, for example. For ''cooling coils'', chilled water and refrigerant are most common. Chilled water is supplied from a [[chiller]] that is potentially located very far away, but refrigerant must come from a nearby condensing unit. When a refrigerant is used, the cooling coil is the [[evaporator]] in the [[vapor-compression refrigeration]] cycle. HVAC coils that use this direct-expansion of refrigerants are commonly called ''DX coils''.  Some ''DX coils'' are "microchannel" type.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.carrier.co.th/knowledge/download/Knowledge_4_MCHX_Technology.pdf MICROCHANNEL TECHNOLOGY] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130604202141/http://www.carrier.co.th/knowledge/download/Knowledge_4_MCHX_Technology.pdf |date=2013-06-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the air side of HVAC coils a significant difference exists between those used for heating, and those for cooling. Due to [[psychrometrics]], air that is cooled often has moisture condensing out of it, except with extremely dry air flows. Heating some air increases that airflow's capacity to hold water. So heating coils need not consider moisture condensation on their air-side, but cooling coils ''must'' be adequately designed and selected to handle their particular ''latent'' (moisture) as well as the ''sensible'' (cooling) loads. The water that is removed is called ''condensate''.

For many climates, water or steam HVAC coils can be exposed to freezing conditions. Because water expands upon freezing, these somewhat expensive and difficult to replace thin-walled heat exchangers can easily be damaged or destroyed by just one freeze. As such, freeze protection of coils is a major concern of HVAC designers, installers, and operators.

The introduction of indentations placed within the heat exchange fins controlled condensation, allowing water molecules to remain in the cooled air. This invention allowed for refrigeration without icing of the cooling mechanism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.google.com/patents/pdf/_RAISLEY_X.pdf?id=zwxKAAAAEBAJ&amp;output=pdf&amp;sig=63-9nepnkjAp6ngTtM6iTQCAca4 Patent 2,046,968 John C Raisley] issued July 7, 1936; filed Jan. 8, 1934 [http://www.google.com/patents?id=zwxKAAAAEBAJ&amp;dq=2046968]&lt;/ref&gt;

The heat exchangers in direct-combustion [[furnace]]s, typical in many residences, are not 'coils'. They are, instead, gas-to-air heat exchangers that are typically made of stamped steel sheet metal. The combustion products pass on one side of these heat exchangers, and air to heat on the other. A ''cracked heat exchanger'' is therefore a dangerous situation that requires immediate attention because combustion products may enter living space.

==Helical-coil heat exchangers==
[[File:HCHE.jpg|thumb|Helical-Coil Heat Exchanger sketch, which consists of a shell, core, and tubes ([[Scott S. Haraburda]] design).]]
Although double-pipe heat exchangers are the simplest to design, the better choice in the following cases would be the helical-coil heat exchanger (HCHE):

* The main advantage of the HCHE, like that for the Spiral heat exchanger (SHE), is its highly efficient use of space, especially when it’s limited and not enough straight pipe can be laid.&lt;ref name=patil&gt;{{cite journal  | author1 = Patil, Ramachandra K. | author2=  Shende, B.W. | author3=  Ghosh, Prasanfa K. | title = Designing a helical-coil heat exchanger | url= https://www.researchgate.net/publictopics.PublicPostFileLoader.html?id=54daea37d5a3f295028b45be&amp;key=cd7c7059-0d79-41f2-9d51-56d00af44bad  | journal = Chemical Engineering | pages = 85–88 |volume= 92 |issue= 24 | date = 13 December 1982 | accessdate= 14 July 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Under conditions of low flowrates (or [[laminar flow]]), such that the typical shell-and-tube exchangers have low heat-transfer coefficients and becoming uneconomical.&lt;ref name=patil /&gt;
* When there is low pressure in one of the fluids, usually from accumulated pressure drops in other process equipment.&lt;ref name=patil /&gt;
* When one of the fluids has components in multiple phases (solids, liquids, and gases), which tends to create mechanical problems during operations, such as plugging of small-diameter tubes.&lt;ref name= haraburda&gt;{{cite journal  | author = Haraburda, Scott S. | title = Three-Phase Flow? Consider Helical-Coil Heat Exchanger | url= http://www.chemengonline.com/articles.php?file=1985-1999/Vol102/chevol102_num7_68.html | journal = Chemical Engineering | pages = 149–151 |volume= 102 |issue= 7 | date = July 1995 | accessdate= 14 July 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Cleaning of helical coils for these multiple-phase fluids can prove to be more difficult than its shell and tube counterpart; however the helical coil unit would require cleaning less often.

These have been used in the nuclear industry as a method for exchanging heat in a [[Sodium-cooled fast reactor|sodium system]] for large [[liquid metal fast breeder reactor]]s since the early 1970s, using an HCHE device invented by [[Charles E. Boardman]] and [[John H. Germer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation  | inventor-last = Boardman | inventor-first = Charles E. | inventor2-last = Germer  | inventor2-first = John H.| issue-date = 1974  | title = Helical Coil Heat Exchanger | country-code = US | patent-number = 3805890 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  There are several simple methods for designing HCHE for all types of manufacturing industries, such as using the [[Ramachandra K. Patil]] (et al.) method from [[India]] and the [[Scott S. Haraburda]] method from the [[United States]].&lt;ref name=patil /&gt;&lt;ref name=haraburda /&gt;

However, these are based upon assumptions of estimating inside heat transfer coefficient, predicting flow around the outside of the coil, and upon constant heat flux.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis | type= Ph.D.  | author= Rennie, Timothy J.  | title= Numerical And Experimental Studies Of A Doublepipe Helical Heat Exchanger | publisher= McGill University | location=  Montreal  | year = 2004 | pages= 3–4 | url = http://webpages.mcgill.ca/staff/deptshare/FAES/066-Bioresource/Theses/theses/308TimothyJohnRennie2004/308TimothyJohnRennie2004.pdf  | accessdate =14 July 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Yet, recent experimental data revealed that the empirical correlations are quite in agreement for designing circular and square pattern HCHEs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  | author1 = Korane, Ashok B. | author2=  Purandare, P.S. | author3=  Mali, K.V. | title = Heat Transfer Analysis Of Helical Coil Heat Exchanger With Circular And Square Coiled Pattern | url= http://www.ijesr.org/admin/upload_journal/journal_ashok%20korane%20%203%20jun.pdf   | journal = International Journal of Engineering &amp; Science Research | pages = 413–423 |volume= 2 |issue= 6 | date = June 2012| accessdate= 14 July 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  During studies published in 2015, several researchers found that the boundary conditions of the outer wall of exchangers were essentially constant heat flux conditions in power plant boilers, condensers and evaporators; while convective heat transfer conditions were more appropriate in food, automobile and process industries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  | author = Kuvadiya, Manish N.   | author2= Deshmukh, Gopal K. | author3= Patel, Rankit A. | author4=  Bhoi, Ramesh H.   | title = Parametric Analysis of Tube in Tube Helical Coil Heat Exchanger at Constant Wall Temperature| journal = International Journal of Engineering Research &amp; Technology | pages = 279–285 |volume= 1

==Spiral heat exchangers==
[[File:Spiral-heat-exchanger-schematic-workaround.svg|thumb|250px|Schematic drawing of a spiral heat exchanger.]]

A modification to the perpendicular flow of the typical HCHE involves the replacement of shell with another coiled tube, allowing the two fluids to flow parallel to one another, and which requires the use of different design calculations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  | author1 = Rennie, Timothy J. | author2= Raghavan, Vijaya G.S. | title = Experimental studies of a double-pipe helical heat exchanger | journal = Experimental Thermal and Fluid Science | pages = 919–924 |volume= 29 |issue= 8 | date = September 2005 | url= http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0894177705000105 | accessdate= 14 July 2015 | doi=10.1016/j.expthermflusci.2005.02.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These are the [[Spiral]] Heat Exchangers (SHE), which may refer to a [[helix|helical]] (coiled) tube configuration, more generally, the term refers to a pair of flat surfaces that are coiled to form the two channels in a counter-flow arrangement. Each of the two channels has one long curved path. A pair of fluid ports are connected [[tangent]]ially to the outer arms of the spiral, and axial ports are common, but optional.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20090209192326/http://gc3.com/techdb/manual/cooltext.htm Cooling Text]&lt;/ref&gt;

The main advantage of the SHE is its highly efficient use of space. This attribute is often leveraged and partially reallocated to gain other improvements in performance, according to well known tradeoffs in heat exchanger design.  (A notable tradeoff is capital cost vs operating cost.)  A compact SHE may be used to have a smaller footprint and thus lower all-around capital costs, or an oversized SHE may be used to have less [[pressure]] drop, less pumping [[energy]], higher [[thermal efficiency]], and lower energy costs.

===Construction===
The distance between the sheets in the spiral channels is maintained by using spacer studs that were welded prior to rolling. Once the main spiral pack has been rolled, alternate top and bottom edges are welded and each end closed by a gasketed flat or conical cover bolted to the body. This ensures no mixing of the two fluids occurs. Any leakage is from the periphery cover to the atmosphere, or to a passage that contains the same fluid.&lt;ref&gt;E.A.D.Saunders (1988). ''Heat Exchangers:Selection Design And Construction'' Longman Scientific and Technical {{ISBN|0-582-49491-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Self cleaning===
Spiral heat exchangers are often used in the heating of fluids that contain solids and thus tend to foul the inside of the heat exchanger. The low pressure drop lets the SHE handle fouling more easily. The SHE uses a “self cleaning” mechanism, whereby fouled surfaces cause a localized increase in fluid velocity, thus increasing the [[drag (physics)|drag]] (or fluid [[friction]]) on the fouled surface, thus helping to dislodge the blockage and keep the heat exchanger clean.  "The internal walls that make up the heat transfer surface are often rather thick, which makes the SHE very robust, and able to last a long time in demanding environments."{{Citation needed|reason=Who said this?|date=June 2013}}
They are also easily cleaned, opening out like an [[oven]] where any buildup of foulant can be removed by [[pressure washer|pressure washing]].

Self-cleaning water filters are used to keep the system clean and running without the need to shut down or replace cartridges and bags.

===Flow arrangements===
[[Image:Comparison of con- and counter-current flow exchange.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A comparison between the operations and effects of a '''cocurrent and a countercurrent flow exchange system''' is depicted by the upper and lower diagrams respectively. In both it is assumed (and indicated) that red has a higher value (e.g. of temperature) than blue and that the property being transported in the channels therefore flows from red to blue. Note that channels are contiguous if  effective exchange is to occur (i.e. there can be no gap between the channels).]]
There are three main types of flows in a spiral heat exchanger:
* '''Counter-current Flow''': Fluids flow in opposite directions.  These are used for liquid-liquid, condensing and gas cooling applications. Units are usually mounted vertically when condensing vapour and mounted horizontally when handling high concentrations of solids.
* '''Spiral Flow/Cross Flow:''' One fluid is in spiral flow and the other in a cross flow. Spiral flow passages are welded at each side for this type of spiral heat exchanger. This type of flow is suitable for handling low density gas, which passes through the cross flow, avoiding pressure loss. It can be used for liquid-liquid applications if one liquid has a considerably greater flow rate than the other.
* '''Distributed Vapour/Spiral flow:''' This design is that of a condenser, and is usually mounted vertically. It is designed to cater for the sub-cooling of both condensate and non-condensables. The coolant moves in a spiral and leaves via the top. Hot gases that enter leave as condensate via the bottom outlet.

===Applications===
The Spiral heat exchanger is good for applications such as pasteurization, digester heating, heat recovery, pre-heating (see: [[recuperator]]), and effluent cooling. For sludge treatment, SHEs are generally smaller than other types of heat exchangers. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://tubingchina.com/Spiral-Heat-Exchanger.htm|title=Spiral Heat Exchanger - China Heat Exchanger Tubing Manufacturer|website=tubingchina.com|access-date=2018-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; These are used to transfer the heat.

==Selection==
Due to the many variables involved, selecting optimal heat exchangers is challenging. Hand calculations are possible, but many iterations are typically needed. As such, heat exchangers are most often selected via computer programs, either by system designers, who are typically  [[engineer]]s, or by equipment vendors.

To select an appropriate heat exchanger, the system designers (or equipment vendors) would firstly consider the design limitations for each heat exchanger type.
Though cost is often the primary criterion, several other selection criteria are important:
* High/low pressure limits
* Thermal performance
* Temperature ranges
* Product mix (liquid/liquid, particulates or high-solids liquid)
* Pressure drops across the exchanger
* Fluid flow capacity
* Cleanability, maintenance and repair
* Materials required for construction
* Ability and ease of future expansion
* Material selection, such as [[Copper in heat exchangers|copper]], [[aluminium]], [[carbon steel]], [[stainless steel]], [[nickel alloys]], [[ceramic]], [[polymer]], and [[titanium]].

Small-diameter coil technologies are becoming more popular in modern air conditioning and refrigeration systems because they have better rates of heat transfer than conventional sized condenser and evaporator coils with round copper tubes and aluminum or copper fin that have been the standard in the HVAC industry. Small diameter coils can withstand the higher pressures required by the new generation of environmentally friendlier refrigerants. Two small diameter coil technologies are currently available for air conditioning and refrigeration products: [[Copper MicroGroove|copper microgroove]]&lt;ref&gt;Microgroove: The Microgroove advantage; http://www.microgroove.net/&lt;/ref&gt; and brazed aluminum microchannel.&lt;ref&gt;Q&amp;A: Microchannel air-cooled condenser; Heatcraft Worldwide Refrigeration; April 2011; http://www.heatcraftrpd.com/landing/2011/air-cooled-condenser/res/pdfs/H-ACCMCX-QA.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Choosing the right heat exchanger (HX) requires some knowledge of the different heat exchanger types, as well as the environment where the unit must operate. Typically in the manufacturing industry, several differing types of heat exchangers are used for just one process or system to derive the final product. For example, a kettle HX for pre-heating, a double pipe HX for the ‘carrier’ fluid and a plate and frame HX for final cooling. With sufficient knowledge of heat exchanger types and operating requirements, an appropriate selection can be made to optimise the process.&lt;ref&gt;

Online monitoring of commercial heat exchangers is done by tracking the overall heat transfer coefficient. The overall heat transfer coefficient tends to decline over time due to fouling.

&lt;big&gt;U=Q/AΔT&lt;/big&gt;&lt;sub&gt;lm&lt;/sub&gt;

By periodically calculating the overall heat transfer coefficient from exchanger flow rates and temperatures, the owner of the heat exchanger can estimate when cleaning the heat exchanger is economically attractive.

Integrity inspection of plate and tubular heat exchanger can be tested in situ by the conductivity or helium gas methods. These methods confirm the integrity of the plates or tubes to prevent any cross contamination and the condition of the gaskets.

Mechanical integrity monitoring of heat exchanger [[Tube (fluid conveyance)|tubes]] may be conducted through [[Tubular NDT|Nondestructive methods]] such as [[eddy current]] testing.

===Fouling===
{{main article|Fouling}}
[[File:Fouling02.jpg|thumb|250px|A heat exchanger in a steam power station contaminated with macrofouling.]]

[[Fouling]] occurs when impurities deposit on the heat exchange surface.
Deposition of these [[impurities]] can decrease heat transfer effectiveness significantly over time and are caused by:
*Low wall shear stress
*Low fluid velocities
*High fluid velocities
*Reaction product solid precipitation
*Precipitation of dissolved impurities due to elevated wall temperatures

The rate of heat exchanger fouling is determined by the rate of particle deposition less re-entrainment/suppression. This model was originally proposed in 1959 by Kern and Seaton.

'''Crude Oil Exchanger Fouling'''. In commercial crude oil refining, crude oil is heated from {{convert|21|C}} to {{convert|343|C}} prior to entering the distillation column. A series of shell and tube heat exchangers typically exchange heat between crude oil and other oil streams to heat the crude to {{Convert|260|C}} prior to heating in a furnace. Fouling occurs on the crude side of these exchangers due to asphaltene insolubility. The nature of asphaltene solubility in crude oil was successfully modeled by Wiehe and Kennedy.&lt;ref&gt;I. A. Wiehe and R. J. Kennedy, Energy &amp; Fuels, 14, 56 – 63 (2000).&lt;/ref&gt; The precipitation of insoluble asphaltenes in crude preheat trains has been successfully modeled as a first order reaction by Ebert and Panchal&lt;ref&gt;Panchal C;B; and Ebert W., Analysis of Exxon Crude-Oil-Slip-Stream Coking Data, Proc of Fouling Mitigation of Industrial Heat-Exchanger Equipment, San Luis Obispo, California, USA, p 451, June 1995&lt;/ref&gt; who expanded on the work of Kern and Seaton.

'''Cooling Water Fouling'''.
Cooling water systems are susceptible to fouling. Cooling water typically has a high total dissolved solids content and suspended colloidal solids. Localized precipitation of dissolved solids occurs at the heat exchange surface due to wall temperatures higher than bulk fluid temperature. Low fluid velocities (less than 3&amp;nbsp;ft/s) allow suspended solids to settle on the heat exchange surface. Cooling water is typically on the tube side of a shell and tube exchanger because it's easy to clean. To prevent fouling, designers typically ensure that cooling water velocity is greater than {{nowrap|0.9 m/s}} and bulk fluid temperature is maintained less than {{convert|60|C}}. Other approaches to control fouling control combine the “blind” application of [[biocide]]s and anti-scale chemicals with periodic lab testing.

===Maintenance===
Plate and frame heat exchangers can be disassembled and cleaned periodically.&lt;ref&gt;[http://aksheattransfer.com/plate.html Plate Heat Exchanger Cleaning Services] AKS Heat Transfer. Retrieved 18 August 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; Tubular heat exchangers can be cleaned by such methods as acid cleaning, [[sandblasting]], [[Water jet cutter|high-pressure water jet]], bullet cleaning, or drill rods.

In large-scale cooling water systems for heat exchangers, [[water treatment]] such as purification, addition of [[chemical]]s, and testing, is used to minimize fouling of the heat exchange equipment. Other water treatment is also used in steam systems for power plants, etc. to minimize fouling and corrosion of the heat exchange and other equipment.

A variety of companies have started using water borne oscillations technology to prevent [[biofouling]]. Without the use of chemicals, this type of technology has helped in providing a low-pressure drop in heat exchangers.

==In nature==

===Humans===
The human nasal passages serve as a heat exchanger, which warms air being inhaled and cools air being exhaled.  Its effectiveness can be demonstrated by putting the hand in front of the face and exhaling, first through the nose and then through the mouth.  Air exhaled through the nose is substantially cooler.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dtic.mil/srch/doc?collection=t3&amp;id=AD0293194 Heat Loss from the Respiratory Tract in Cold], Defense Technical Information Center, April 1955&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Eckert animal physiology: mechanisms and adaptations |last=Randall |first=David J. |author2=Warren W. Burggren |author3=Kathleen French |author4=Roger Eckert  |year=2002 |publisher=Macmillan |isbn=0-7167-3863-5 |page=587}}&lt;/ref&gt; This effect can be enhanced with clothing, by, for example, wearing a scarf over the face while breathing in cold weather.

In species that have external testes (such as humans), the artery to the testis is surrounded by a mesh of veins called the [[pampiniform plexus]]. This cools the blood heading to the testes, while reheating the returning blood.

===Birds, fish, marine mammals===
[[File:Countercurrent conservator.svg|thumb|right|300px|Countercurrent exchange conservation circuit]]
{{further information|Countercurrent exchange#Countercurrent exchange in biological systems{{!}}Countercurrent exchange in biological systems }}
"[[Countercurrent exchange|Countercurrent]]" heat exchangers occur naturally in the circulation system of [[fish]], [[whale]]s and other [[marine mammals]]. Arteries to the skin carrying warm blood are intertwined with veins from the skin carrying cold blood, causing the warm arterial blood to exchange heat with the cold venous blood. This reduces the overall heat loss in cold waters. Heat exchangers are also present in the tongue of [[baleen whale]]s as large volumes of water flow through their mouths.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20090614084555/http://www.nhm.org/research/mammals/jj/ ]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1126/science.278.5340.1138 |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/278/5340/1138 |journal=Science |volume=278 |issue=5340 |author=Heyning and Mead |pages=1138–1140 |date=November 1997 |title=Thermoregulation in the Mouths of Feeding Gray Whales |accessdate=2010-01-19 |pmid=9353198 |last2=Mead |first2=JG}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wading birds use a similar system to limit heat losses from their body through their legs into the water.

===Carotid rete===
The carotid rete is a counter-current heat exchanging organ in some [[ungulate]]s. The blood ascending the carotid arteries on its way to the brain, flows via a network of vessels where heat is discharged to the veins of cooler blood descending from the nasal passages. The carotid rete allows [[Thomson's gazelle]] to maintain its brain almost 3&amp;nbsp;°C (5.4&amp;nbsp;°F) cooler than the rest of the body, and therefore aids in tolerating bursts in metabolic heat production such as associated with outrunning [[cheetah]]s (during which the body temperature exceeds the maximum temperature at which the brain could function).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asknature.org/strategy/10e254e7306d0e0ac711e77df408bd0d Carotid rete cools brain: Thomson's gazelle -- AskNature]&lt;/ref&gt;

==In industry==
Heat exchangers are widely used in industry both for cooling and heating large scale industrial processes. The type and size of heat exchanger used can be tailored to suit a process depending on the type of fluid, its phase, temperature, density, viscosity, pressures, chemical composition and various other thermodynamic properties.

In many industrial processes there is waste of energy or a heat stream that is being exhausted, heat exchangers can be used to recover this heat and put it to use by heating a different stream in the process. This practice saves a lot of money in industry, as the heat supplied to other streams from the heat exchangers would otherwise come from an external source that is more expensive and more harmful to the environment.

Heat exchangers are used in many industries, including:
* [[Waste water treatment]]
* [[Refrigeration]]
* [[Wine]] and [[brewery|beer]] making
* [[Petroleum refining]]
* [[nuclear power]]

In waste water treatment, heat exchangers play a vital role in maintaining optimal temperatures within [[anaerobic digester]]s to promote the growth of microbes that remove pollutants. Common types of heat exchangers used in this application are the double pipe heat exchanger as well as the plate and frame heat exchanger.

==In aircraft==
In commercial aircraft heat exchangers are used to take heat from the engine's oil system to heat cold fuel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.freepatentsonline.com/4498525.html| title = United States Patent 4498525, Fuel/oil heat exchange system for an engine| accessdate = 3 February 2009| publisher = United States Patent and Trademark Office}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This improves fuel efficiency, as well as reduces the possibility of water entrapped in the fuel freezing in components.&lt;ref name="2009-heat-exchanger"&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.flightglobal.com/articles/2009/02/03/322023/boeing-links-heathrow-atlanta-trent-895-engine-rollbacks.html| title = Boeing links Heathrow, Atlanta Trent 895 engine rollbacks| accessdate = 3 February 2009| publisher = FlightGlobal.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current market and forecast==
Estimated at US$42.7 billion in 2012, the global demand of heat exchangers will experience robust growth of about 7.8% annually over the next years. The market value is expected to reach US$57.9 billion by 2016 and to approach US$78.16 billion by 2020. Tubular heat exchangers and plate heat exchangers are still the most widely applied product types.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Market Report: Global Heat Exchanger Market | publisher = Acmite Market Intelligence | url = http://www.acmite.com/market-reports/environmentals/global-heat-exchanger-market-report.html |date = October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==A model of a simple heat exchanger==

A simple heat exchange  &lt;ref&gt;Kay J M &amp; Nedderman R M (1985) ''Fluid Mechanics and Transfer Processes'', Cambridge University Press&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = MIT web course on Heat Exchangers| publisher = [MIT] | url = http://web.mit.edu/16.unified/www/FALL/thermodynamics/notes/node131.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;    might be thought of as two straight pipes with fluid flow, which are thermally connected. Let the pipes be of equal length ''L'', carrying fluids with [[heat capacity]] &lt;math&gt;C_i&lt;/math&gt; (energy per unit mass per unit change in temperature) and let the mass flow rate of the fluids through the pipes, both in the same direction, be &lt;math&gt;j_i&lt;/math&gt; (mass per unit time), where the subscript ''i'' applies to pipe 1 or pipe 2.

Temperature profiles for the pipes are &lt;math&gt;T_1(x)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;T_2(x)&lt;/math&gt; where ''x'' is the distance along the pipe. Assume a steady state, so that the temperature profiles are not functions of time. Assume also that the only transfer of heat from a small volume of fluid in one pipe is to the fluid element in the other pipe at the same position, i.e., there is no transfer of heat along a pipe due to temperature differences in that pipe. By [[Newton's law of cooling]] the rate of change in energy of a small volume of fluid is proportional to the difference in temperatures between it and the corresponding element in the other pipe:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{du_1}{dt}=\gamma(T_2-T_1)&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{du_2}{dt}=\gamma(T_1-T_2)&lt;/math&gt;

( this is for parallel flow in the same direction and opposite temperature gradients, but for counter-flow heat exchange [[countercurrent exchange]] the sign is opposite in the second equation in front of &lt;math&gt;\gamma(T_1-T_2)&lt;/math&gt;  )

, where &lt;math&gt;u_i(x)&lt;/math&gt; is the thermal energy per unit length and γ is the thermal connection constant per unit length between the two pipes. This change in internal energy results in a change in the temperature of the fluid element. The time rate of change for the fluid element being carried along by the flow is:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{du_1}{dt}=J_1 \frac{dT_1}{dx}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{du_2}{dt}=J_2 \frac{dT_2}{dx}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;J_i={C_i}   {j_i}&lt;/math&gt; is the "thermal mass flow rate". The differential equations governing the heat exchanger may now be written as:

:&lt;math&gt;J_1\frac{\partial T_1}{\partial x}=\gamma(T_2-T_1)&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;J_2\frac{\partial T_2}{\partial x}=\gamma(T_1-T_2).&lt;/math&gt;

Note that, since the system is in a steady state, there are no partial derivatives of temperature with respect to time, and since there is no heat transfer along the pipe, there are no second derivatives in ''x'' as is found in the [[heat equation]]. These two coupled first-order [[differential equation]]s may be solved to yield:

:&lt;math&gt;T_1=A-\frac{Bk_1}{k}\,e^{-kx}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;T_2=A+\frac{Bk_2}{k}\,e^{-kx}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;k_1=\gamma/J_1&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;k_2=\gamma/J_2&lt;/math&gt;,

:&lt;math&gt;k=k_1+k_2&lt;/math&gt;

(this is for parallel-flow, but for counter-flow the sign in front of   &lt;math&gt;k_2&lt;/math&gt;  is negative, so that if   &lt;math&gt;k_2=k_1&lt;/math&gt;, for the same "thermal mass flow rate" in both opposite directions,  the gradient of temperature is constant and the temperatures linear in position ''x'' with a constant difference &lt;math&gt;(T_2-T_1)&lt;/math&gt; along the exchanger, explaining why the counter current design [[countercurrent exchange]] is the most efficient )

and ''A'' and ''B'' are two as yet undetermined constants of integration. Let &lt;math&gt;T_{10}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;T_{20}&lt;/math&gt; be the temperatures at x=0 and let &lt;math&gt;T_{1L}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;T_{2L}&lt;/math&gt; be the temperatures at the end of the pipe at x=L. Define the average temperatures in each pipe as:

:&lt;math&gt;\overline{T}_1=\frac{1}{L}\int_0^LT_1(x)dx&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\overline{T}_2=\frac{1}{L}\int_0^LT_2(x)dx.&lt;/math&gt;

Using the solutions above, these temperatures are:

::{|
|-
| &lt;math&gt;T_{10}=A-\frac{Bk_1}{k}&lt;/math&gt;
| &lt;math&gt;T_{20}=A+\frac{Bk_2}{k}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| &lt;math&gt;T_{1L}=A-\frac{Bk_1}{k}e^{-kL}&lt;/math&gt;
| &lt;math&gt;T_{2L}=A+\frac{Bk_2}{k}e^{-kL}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| &lt;math&gt;\overline{T}_1=A-\frac{Bk_1}{k^2L}(1-e^{-kL})&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
| &lt;math&gt;\overline{T}_2=A+\frac{Bk_2}{k^2L}(1-e^{-kL}).&lt;/math&gt;
|}

Choosing any two of the temperatures above eliminates the constants of integration, letting us find the other four temperatures. We find the total energy transferred by integrating the expressions for the time rate of change of internal energy per unit length:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dU_1}{dt} = \int_0^L \frac{du_1}{dt}\,dx = J_1(T_{1L}-T_{10})=\gamma L(\overline{T}_2-\overline{T}_1)&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dU_2}{dt} = \int_0^L \frac{du_2}{dt}\,dx = J_2(T_{2L}-T_{20})=\gamma L(\overline{T}_1-\overline{T}_2).&lt;/math&gt;

By the conservation of energy, the sum of the two energies is zero. The quantity &lt;math&gt;\overline{T}_2-\overline{T}_1&lt;/math&gt; is known as the ''[[Log mean temperature difference]]'', and is a measure of the effectiveness of the heat exchanger in transferring heat energy.

[[File:EncycBrit1913.jpg|thumb|250 px|The 1911 Encyclopædia Britannica boasted of its India paper printing]]
'''India paper''' is a type of [[paper]] which from 1875 has been based on [[bleach]]ed [[hemp]] and rag fibres, that produced a very thin, tough opaque white paper. It has a basis weight of 20 pounds, yet bulks 1,000 pages to the inch.&lt;ref&gt;Dictionary of Printing &amp; Publishing. (1997). Middlesex, UK: Peter Collin Publishing. {{ISBN|0-948549-99-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It became popular in particular for the printing of [[Bible]]s, which could be made relatively small and light while remaining legible. The 1911 Encyclopædia Britannica boasted, "Printed on thin, but strong opaque India paper, each volume but one inch in thickness." The process was used particularly by the [[Oxford University Press]] and its paper suppliers. The name arose because the paper imitated fine papers imported from the [[Indian subcontinent]].&lt;ref&gt;Berry, W. &amp; Poole, H. (1966).

Times to 1950. London, UK: Blandford Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jennett, S. (1951). The Making of Books. London, UK: Faber &amp; Faber.&lt;/ref&gt;

India paper has also often been used for the printing of [[Die proof (philately)|die proofs]] of postage stamps.

The '''International Human Powered Vehicle Association (IHPVA)''' is dedicated to promoting the design and development of [[human powered vehicle]]s.

== History ==

The IHPVA was [[World Human Powered Vehicle Association|founded in 1976]] in the USA and was for many years an association of individual members with the publications '''Human Power''' and '''HPV News'''. In 1997, the IHPVA was reorganised into an international association with national organisations as members and an American association which adopted the name Human Powered Vehicle Association HPVA.

Due to conflicts regarding record keeping and copyrights, the HPVA left the IHPVA in 2004. In 2008, the HPVA decided to rename itself to IHPVA while the IHPVA of this time decided to keep its name, resulting in a brief period with two organisations of the same name.

In a hostile takeover, the American IHPVA also seized control of the domain name ihpva.org away from the international IHPVA.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.recumbents.com/forums/topic.asp?TOPIC_ID=2314 IHPVA Organization call for support], extensive discussion with views from both sides on the Recumbents.com web forum, December 2008&lt;/ref&gt; This tried to regain its domain by appealing to the [[ICANN]]'s ombudsman but was unsuccessful and in 2009 renamed itself to '''[[World Human Powered Vehicle Association|World Human Powered Vehicle Association (WHPVA)]]'''.

}}'''John Henry Holmes''' (1857-1935) was an English [[Electrical engineering|electrical engineer]], inventor, [[Quaker]] and pioneer of [[electric light]]ing who invented the quick break light switch, the technology behind which remains the basis for modern wall mounted [[light switch]]es.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.greatnorthgreats.com/view-gng-item?id=51&amp;type=1|title=View GNG Item - Great North Run Culture|website=www.greatnorthgreats.com|access-date=2016-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==
[[File:Large "Castle" Dynamo.jpg|thumb|A 200 HP J.H. Holmes &amp; Co Large "Castle" Dynamo]]
In 1880, Holmes attended a public demonstration of [[Joseph Swan|Joseph Swan's]] incandescent light bulb. This seemed to spark his interest in electric lighting, and he approached Swan on multiple occasions in hopes of becoming his apprentice.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture-professionals-network/culture-professionals-blog/2013/jun/07/first-time-out-museums-swap|title=What's in store: how First Time Out opened our eyes to new possibilities|last=Clayson|first=John|last2=Maggs|first2=Katie|date=2013-06-07|website=the Guardian|access-date=2016-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

John Henry Holmes and his brother Theodore, also a [[Quaker]], founded '''J. H. Holmes &amp; Co.''' in [[Shieldfield]], [[Newcastle upon Tyne]] in 1883, their manufacturing company specializing in early [[Engine|motors]], [[dynamo]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=1898|title=New Catalogues and Trade Publications|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=akUAAAAAMAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|journal=The Engineering Magazine|series=An Industrial Review|volume=14|page=910|doi=|pmid=|access-date=18 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.powerhousemuseum.com/collection/database/?irn=245955|title=H6579 Recording voltmeter, J H Holmes &amp; Co, Newcastle-on-Tyne, UK|website=www.powerhousemuseum.com|language=en|access-date=2016-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gracesguide.co.uk/J._H._Holmes_and_Co|title=J.

John Henry Holmes invented the quick break light switch in 1884.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.englandsnortheast.co.uk/electric1870s.html|title=Electric light in North East England.|website=www.englandsnortheast.co.uk|access-date=2016-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was patented in Great Britain &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://worldwide.espacenet.com/publicationDetails/originalDocument?CC=GB&amp;NR=188403256A&amp;KC=A&amp;FT=D&amp;ND=5&amp;date=18840929&amp;DB=&amp;locale=|title=GB Patent No. 3256 of 1884: 'Improvements in or Applicable to Switches or Circuit Closers for Electrical Conducting Apparatus'||date=1884-09-29|publisher=Her Majesty's Stationery Office|website=European Patent Office/|language=en|access-date=2017-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the United States &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://pdfpiw.uspto.gov/.piw?PageNum=0&amp;docid=00305310|title=US Patent No. 305310 of 1884: 'Electric Circuit Closer'||date=1884-09-16|website=United States Patent and Trade Mark Office/|language=en|access-date=2017-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; that year. The technology augmented the standard switch by ensuring the internal contacts moved apart quickly enough to deter the [[electric arc]]ing that created a fire hazard and otherwise invariably shortened the switch's lifespan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://professionaldesignmagazine.org/archives/the-classic-light-switch-redefined | title=The Classic Light Switch, Redefined | date=24 January 2017 | work=Professional Design | accessdate=14 April 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The quick break technology remains in use in domestic and industrial light switches modern times.

The '''Land grant to Marduk-apla-iddina kudurru''' is a grey limestone 0.7-meter tall ancient [[Mesopotamia]]n ''narû'' or entitlement stele recording the gift of four tracts of cultivated land with settlements totaling 84 &lt;small&gt;GUR&lt;/small&gt; 160 ''qa'' by [[Kassites|Kassite]] king of [[Babylon]], [[Meli-Shipak II|Meli-Šipak]] (ca. 1186–1172 BC ), to a person described as his servant (arassu irīm: “he granted his servant”) named Marduk-apla-iddina, who may be his son and/or successor or alternatively another homonymous individual. The large size of the grant together with the generous freedom from all territorial obligations (taxation, corvée, draft, foraging) has led historians to assume he was the prince. There are thirty six [[kudurru]]s which are placed on the basis of art-history to Meli-Šipak's reign, of which eight are specifically identified by his name.&lt;ref name=seidl&gt;{{ cite book | title = Die Babylonischen Kudurru-Reliefs: Symbole Mesopotamischer Gottheiten | author = Ursula Seidl | publisher = Academic Press Fribourg | year = 1989 | page = 28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is the best preserved of all of them.

==The stele==
The kudurru was recovered in 1899 from [[Susa]], excavation reference Sb 22, by the French archaeological expedition under the auspices of [[Jacques de Morgan]] and brought to the [[Musée du Louvre]] where it still resides. The object is inscribed on three sides in seven columns and 387 lines. Like most kudurrus, it portrays Mesopotamian gods graphically in segmented ''[[Register (sculpture)|registers]]'' on the stone. In this case the divine icons number twenty-four in five registers, rather more than usual.

The bequest was for communal land of the city of Agade located around the settlement of Tamakku adjacent to the royal canal in Bīt-Piri’-Amurru,&lt;ref name=hinke&gt;{{ cite book | title = A New Boundary Stone of Nebuchadrezzar I from Nippur (BE IV) | author = W. J. Hinke | publisher = University of Philadelphia | year = 1907 | pages = 27–29, 232–233 }}&lt;/ref&gt; a province in northern Babylonia.&lt;ref name=sassmannshausen&gt;{{ cite book | title = Beiträge zur Verwaltung und Gesellschaft Babyloniens in der Kassitenzeit | author = Leonhard Sassmannshausen | publisher = Philipp von Zabern | year = 2001 | pages = 30, 46 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|30}} In a passage granting exemptions from service and taxation to the residents of the transferred territory, a list of officials are forbidden from appropriating the land and levying labor with restrictions placed on their conduct. This includes the king himself, the ''šakin māti'' (the governor of the land), and the ''pīḫātu'' (rank uncertain) of Bīt-Piri’-Amurru, contradicting the image of oriental despotism sometimes portrayed concerning the period.&lt;ref name=slanski&gt;{{ cite book | title = The Babylonian Entitlement narûs (kudurrus): A study in their form and function | author = Kathryn E. Slanksi | publisher = ASOR | year = 2003 | pages = 177–179, 194–195 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|177–179}}

The text concludes with an unusual series of blessings and curses including a rather gruesome curse of Gula, “may she place in his body her oozing (sores), a persistent carbuncle, of no release, so that, for as long as he lives, he may bathe in blood and pus like water!”, which seems to have been reproduced on the [[Stele of Meli-Šipak]].&lt;ref name=slanski/&gt;{{rp|194–195}} There are no witnesses listed to validate the bequest, more evidence to suggest it was a gift between royalty.

=== Fiction ===

====Films====
In the 1992 film [[Fortress (1992 film)|''Fortress'']], prisoners are kept secured by laser walls.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

====Videogames====

'''Macquarie Generation''' is an [[electricity generation]] company in [[New South Wales]], [[Australia]] that is owned by [[AGL Energy]], and has a portfolio of generating sites using predominantly [[Fossil fuel power plant|thermal coal]] power. The company now trades as AGL Macquarie and generates electricity for sale under contract. 

AGL Macquarie supplies approximately 12% of the [[National Electricity Market]] and 30% of the New South Wales electricity market.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.macgen.com.au/ "Macgen Website"]&lt;/ref&gt; In early stages, Macquarie has commenced development of [[solar thermal power]] as a [[renewable energy|renewable]] [[Energy development|source of energy]].

==History==
Macquarie Generation was established by the [[Government of New South Wales]] in 1996 under the {{Cite Legislation AU |NSW|act||State Owned Corporations Act, 1989}} and the {{Cite Legislation AU |NSW|act||Energy Services Corporation Act, 1995}} as part of the split up of the [[Electricity Commission of New South Wales]].

In September 2014, the NSW Government sold Macquarie Generation to [[AGL Energy]] for $1.5 billion.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.agl.com.au/about-agl/media-centre/article-list/2014/september/agl-completes-sale-of-macquarie-generation-and-announces-leadership-change&lt;/ref&gt; Macquarie Generation‘s assets included the 2,640 MW [[Bayswater Power Station]], the 2,000 MW [[Liddell Power Station]], the 50 MW Hunter Valley Gas Turbines and the Liddell Solar Thermal Project.&lt;ref name=macgen&gt;[http://www.macgen.com.au/ "AGL Macquarie Website"]&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Liddell Power Station is scheduled to close in 2022.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.agl.com.au/about-agl/media-centre/asx-and-media-releases/2017/september/agl-energy-statement-on-liddell-power-station |title=AGL Energy statement on Liddell Power Station |date=6 September 2017 |accessdate=6 September 2017 |publisher=[[AGL Energy]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5789">'''Microcrystalline waxes''' are a type of [[wax]] produced by de-oiling [[petrolatum]], as part of the [[petroleum]] [[refining]] process. In contrast to the more familiar [[paraffin wax]] which contains mostly unbranched [[alkane]]s, microcrystalline wax contains a higher percentage of [[isoparaffin]]ic (branched) [[hydrocarbon]]s and [[naphthene|naphthenic]] hydrocarbons. It is characterized by the fineness of its [[Crystal structure|crystals]] in contrast to the larger crystal of paraffin wax. It consists of high [[molecular mass|molecular weight]] saturated [[Aliphatic compound|aliphatic]] [[hydrocarbon]]s. It is generally darker, more [[viscous]], denser, tackier and more elastic than paraffin waxes, and has a higher [[molecular weight]] and [[melting point]]. The [[Elasticity (physics)|elastic]] and [[adhesive]] characteristics of microcrystalline waxes are related to the non-straight chain components which they contain. Typical microcrystalline wax [[crystal structure]] is small and thin, making them more flexible than paraffin wax. It is commonly used in [[cosmetics|cosmetic]] formulations.

Microcrystalline waxes when produced by wax refiners are typically produced to meet a number of [[ASTM International|ASTM]] specifications. These include congeal point (ASTM D938), needle penetration (D1321), color (ASTM D6045), and viscosity (ASTM D445). Microcrystalline waxes can generally be put into two categories: "laminating" grades and "hardening" grades. The laminating grades typically have a melt point of 140-175 F (60 - 80 &lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;C) and needle penetration of 25 or above. The hardening grades will range from about 175-200 F (80 - 93 &lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;C), and have a needle penetration of 25 or below. Color in both grades can range from brown to white, depending on the degree of processing done at the refinery level.

Microcrystalline waxes are derived from the refining of the heavy distillates from lubricant oil production. This by-product must then be de-oiled at a wax refinery. Depending on the end use and desired specification, the product may then have its odor removed and color removed (which typically starts as a brown or dark yellow). This is usually done by means of a filtration method or by hydro-treating the wax material.

==Industries and Applications==

Microcrystalline wax is often used in industries such as tire and rubber, candles, adhesives, corrugated board, cosmetics, castings, and others. Refineries may use blending facilities to combine paraffin and microcrystalline waxes; this is prevalent in the tire and rubber industries.

Microcrystalline waxes have considerable application in the custom making of jewelry and small sculptures.  Different formulations produce waxes from those soft enough to be molded by hand to those hard enough to be carved with rotary tools.  The melted wax can be cast to make multiple copies that are further carved with details.  Jewelry suppliers sell wax molded into the basic forms of rings as well as details that can be heat welded together and tubes and sheets for cutting and building the wax models.  Rings may be attached to a wax "tree" so that many can be cast in one pouring.

A brand of microcrystalline wax, [[Renaissance Wax]], is also used extensively in museum and conservation settings for protection and polishing of antique woods, ivory, gemstones, and metal objects. It was developed by [[The British Museum]] in the 1950s to replace the potentially unstable natural waxes that were previously used such as beeswax and carnauba. 

Microcrystalline waxes are excellent materials to use when modifying the crystalline properties of paraffin wax. The microcrystalline wax has significantly more branching of the carbon chains that are the backbone of paraffin wax. This is useful when some desired functional changes in the paraffin are needed, such as flexibility, higher melt point, and increased opacity.
They are also used as slip agents in [[printing ink]].

Microcrystalline wax is used in sports too, specifically in [[ice hockey]] and [[snowboarding]]. It is applied to the [[friction tape]] of an [[ice hockey stick]] to prevent degradation of the tape due to water destroying the glue on the tape and also to increase control of the hockey puck due to the wax’s adhesive quality. It is also applied to the underside of snowboards to reduce friction and increase the gliding ability of the board, making it easier to control.

Microcrystalline wax was used in the final phases of the restoration of the [[Cosmati]] pavement, [[Westminster Abbey]], London.

==Use in Petrolatum==

Microcrystalline wax is also a key component in the manufacture of [[petrolatum]]. The branched structure of the carbon chain backbone allows oil molecules to be incorporated into the crystal lattice structure. The desired properties of the petrolatum can be modified by using microcrystalline wax bases of different congeal points (ASTM test D938) and needle penetration (ASTM D1321).

However, key industries that utilize petrolatum, such as the personal care, cosmetic, and candle industries, have pushed for more materials that are considered "green" and based on renewable resources. As an alternative, hybrid petrolatum can be used. Hybrid petrolatum utilizes a complex mixture of vegetable oils and waxes and combines them with petroleum and micro wax based technologies. This allows a formulator to incorporate higher percentages of renewable resources while maintaining the beneficial properties of the petrolatum.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4452">The term '''micromeritics''' was given to the science and technology of small particles by J. M. DallaValle{{reference needed|date=September 2017}}. It is thus the study of the fundamental and derived properties of individual as well as a collection of particles. The knowledge and control of the size of particles is of importance in [[pharmacy]] and [[materials science]]. The size, and hence the [[surface area]] of a [[wiktionary:Particle|particle]], can be related to the physical, chemical and [[pharmacologic]] properties of drugs. Clinically, the [[wiktionary :Particle|particle]] size of a [[drug]] can affect its release from [[dosage forms]] that are administered orally, [[parenterally]], rectally and [[topically]]. The successful [[formulation]] of [[suspensions]], [[emulsions]] and [[Tablet (pharmacy)|tablets]]; both physical [[Chemical stability|stability]] and [[pharmacologic]] response also depends on the particle size achieved in the product.&lt;ref name=Brittain1995&gt;{{cite book |author=Brittain, H.

==Origin==
The term was created by J. M. DallaValle in his book ''Micromeritics: the technology of fine particles''. It was derived from the Greek words for ''small'' and ''part''. The size range which he covered in the book was from 10&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; to 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; [[micrometers]]. Anything smaller than this but bigger than a [[molecule]] was referred to at the time as a [[colloid]] but is now often referred to as a [[nanoparticle]]. Applications included [[soil physics]], [[mineral|mineral physics]], [[chemical engineering]], [[geology]], and [[hydrology]]. Characteristics discussed included [[particle size]] and shape, [[sphere packing|packing]], [[electrical]], [[Rayleigh scattering|optical]], [[Surface to volume ratio#Physical chemistry|chemical]] and [[surface science]].

==Applications==

===Release and dissolution===

Particle size and surface area influence the release of a drug from a dosage form that is administered [[mouth|orally]], rectally, [[parenterally]], and [[topically]]. Higher surface area brings about intimate contact of the drug with the [[dissolution (chemistry)|dissolution]] [[fluids]] [[in vivo]] and increases the [[drug]] [[solubility]] and dissolution.

===Absorption and drug action===

[[Particle size]] and [[surface area]] influence the [[drug]] [[absorption (pharmacokinetics)|absorption]] and subsequently the [[therapeutic]] action. The higher the dissolution, the faster the absorption and hence the quicker and greater the [[drug]] action.

===Physical stability===

Micromeritic properties of a [[wiktionary:Particle|particle]], i.e. the [[particle size]] in a [[formulation]], influence the physical stability of the [[suspensions]] and [[emulsions]]. The smaller the size of the [[wiktionary:Particle|particle]], the better the physical stability of the [[dosage form]] owing to the [[Brownian motion]] of the particles in the [[dispersion (chemistry)|dispersion]].

===Dose uniformity===

Good flow properties of [[:wikt:granule|granules]] and [[Powder (substance)|powders]] are important in the [[manufacturing]] of [[Tablet (pharmacy)|tablets]] and [[Capsule (pharmacy)|capsules]]. The distribution of particles should be uniform in terms of number and [[weight]]. Very small particle size causes attraction, which in turn destabilises the suspension by coagulating.

For example, in the context of porous aggregations such as soil, micropores are defined as cavities with sizes less than 30&amp;nbsp;μm.&lt;ref name=pore&gt;{{cite book |title= Glossary of Soil Science Terms 2008 |last= Soil Science Glossary Terms Committee |year= 2008 |publisher= Soil Science Society of America |location= Madison, WI |isbn= 978-0-89118-851-3 |url= https://www.soils.org/publications/soils-glossary#}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses in laboratories==

Microporous materials are often used in laboratory environments to facilitate contaminant-free exchange of gases. Mold spores, bacteria, and other airborne contaminants will become trapped, while allowing gases to pass through the material. This allows for a sterile environment within the contained area.

==Use in medicine==
[[Image:Albupore surgical tape.jpg|thumb|250px|Albupore microporous surgical tape]]

Microporous adhesive tape is a [[surgical tape]] used to hold wound dressings and [[bandage]]s in place, introduced in 1959 by [[3M]] with the [[trade name]] ''Micropore''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20071019235047/http://www.3m.com/intl/sg/Micropore.html]&lt;/ref&gt; It can be used to hold gauze padding over small wounds, usually as a temporary measure until a suitable [[dressing (medical)|dressing]] is applied.&lt;ref name=3M&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.3m.com/3M/en_US/company-us/all-3m-products/~/3M-Micropore-Surgical-Tape?N=5002385+3293321960&amp;rt=rud |title= 3M Micropore Surgical Tape|accessdate=2017-06-19 |work=Medicine |publisher=3M Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Steri-Strip]] was derived from Microporous surgical tape.

==Other uses==

Microporous tape is used by some professional extreme yo-yoers to wrap around their fingers and prevent string burn or irritation.

Rock climbers use microporous tape to wrap their hands in 'tape gloves', a means of protecting the skin from rock abrasion when jamming hands into cracks as a means of ascent (crack climbing, as opposed to face climbing - gripping holds on the face of the rock).

Microporous media used in large format printing applications normally with a pigment based ink to maintain colour balance and life expectancy of the resultant printed image.

Microporous tape is also used by some film and TV sound recordists to affix small radio microphones to actors' skin.

Microporous material is also used as high performance insulation material used from home applications up to metal furnaces requiring material that can withstand more than 1000 Celsius.

Young shoots have purplish or greenish-white, hairy bark. The tree has an open crown of drooping, fragile branches and the leaves build up a feathery foliage of [[tripinnate]] leaves.

The flowers are fragrant and asexual,&lt;ref name=cabi/&gt; surrounded by five unequal, thinly veined, yellowish-white petals. The flowers are about 1.0–1.5&amp;nbsp;cm (1/2") long and 2.0&amp;nbsp;cm (3/4") broad. They grow on slender, hairy stalks in spreading or drooping flower clusters which have a length of 10–25&amp;nbsp;cm.&lt;ref name=parotta/&gt;

Flowering begins within the first six months after planting. In seasonally cool regions, flowering only occurs once a year between April and June. In more constant seasonal temperatures and with constant rainfall, flowering can happen twice or even all year-round.&lt;ref name=parotta/&gt;

The fruit is a hanging, three-sided brown capsule of 20–45&amp;nbsp;cm size which holds dark brown, globular seeds with a diameter around 1&amp;nbsp;cm. The seeds have three whitish papery wings and are dispersed by wind and water.&lt;ref name=parotta/&gt;

==Cultivation==
The moringa tree is grown mainly in [[semiarid]], [[tropical]], and [[subtropical]] areas, corresponding in the United States to [[USDA hardiness zone]]s 9 and 10. It tolerates a wide range of soil conditions, but prefers a neutral to slightly acidic ([[pH]] 6.3 to 7.0), well-drained sandy or loamy soil.&lt;ref name=ted/&gt; In waterlogged soil, the roots have a tendency to rot.&lt;ref name=ted/&gt;  Moringa is a sun- and heat-loving plant, and does not tolerate [[freezing]] or [[frost]]. Moringa is particularly suitable for dry regions, as it can be grown using rainwater without expensive irrigation techniques.

===Production area===
[[India]] is the largest producer of moringa, with an annual production of 1.2 million tonnes of fruits from an area of 380&amp;nbsp;km².&lt;ref name=ted/&gt;

Moringa is grown in home gardens in [[West Bengal]] and [[Odisha]] and as living fences in  [[southern India]] and [[Thailand]], where it is commonly sold in local markets. In the [[Philippines]] and [[Indonesia]], it is commonly grown for its leaves which are used as food. Moringa is also actively cultivated by the [[World Vegetable Center]] in [[Taiwan]], a center for vegetable research. In [[Haiti]], it is grown as [[windbreak]]s and to help reduce [[soil erosion]].{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

More generally, moringa grows in the wild or is cultivated in [[Central America]] and the [[Caribbean]], northern countries of [[South America]], [[Africa]], [[Southeast Asia]] and various countries of [[Oceania]].

As of 2010, cultivation in [[Hawaii]], for commercial distribution in the [[United States]], is in its early stages.&lt;ref name="ted"&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cultivation practice===
====Soil preparations====
In tropical cultivation, [[soil erosion]] is a major problem. Therefore, the soil treatment has to be as shallow as possible. Plowing is required only for high planting densities. In low planting densities, "it is better to dig pits and refill them with the soil. This ensures good root system penetration without causing too much land erosion. The pits must be 30 to 50 cm deep, and 20 to 40 cm wide."{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

====Propagation====
Moringa can be [[plant propagation|propagated]] from [[seed]] or [[cutting (plant)|cuttings]]. 
Direct seeding is possible because the [[germination rate]] of ''M. oleifera'' is high. Moringa seeds can be germinated year-round in well-draining soil. Cuttings of 1 m length and at least 4&amp;nbsp;cm diameter can be used for [[vegetative propagation]].

====Planting====
For intensive leaf production, "the spacing of plants should be 15 x 15 cm or 20 x 10 cm, with conveniently spaced alleys (for example: every 4 m) to facilitate plantation management and harvests."&lt;ref name="amaglo"/&gt; [[Weeding]] and [[disease prevention]] are difficult because of the high density.  In a semi-intensive production, the plants are spaced 50&amp;nbsp;cm to 1 m apart. This gives good results with less maintenance.

Moringa trees can also be cultivated in alleys, as natural fences and associated with other crops. The distance between moringa rows in an agroforestry cultivation is usually between 2 and 4 m.

==Breeding==
In India, from where moringa most likely originated, the diversity of wild types is large. This gives a good basis for breeding programs. In countries where moringa has been introduced, the diversity is usually much smaller among the cultivar types. Locally well-adapted wild types, though, can be found in most regions.

Because moringa is cultivated and used in different ways, there are different breeding aims. The breeding aims for an annual or a perennial plant are obviously different. The yield stability of fruits is an important breeding aim for the commercial cultivation in India, where moringa is cultivated as an annual. On less favorable locations, perennial cultivation has big advantages. Erosion is much smaller with perennial cultivation. In [[Pakistan]], varieties have been tested for their nutritional composition of the leaves on different locations.&lt;ref name=Rees3&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.jfca.2005.05.001 |title=Effect of season and production location on antioxidant activity of Moringa oleifera leaves grown in Pakistan |year=2006 |last1=Iqbal |first1=Shahid |last2=Bhanger |first2=M.I. |journal=Journal of Food Composition and Analysis |volume=19 |issue=6–7 |pages=544–551}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The different breeding aims result in a different selection. India selects for a higher number of pods and dwarf or semidwarf varieties. Breeders in Tanzania, though, are selecting for higher oil content.

==Yield and harvest==
''M. oleifera'' can be cultivated for its leaves, pods, and/or its kernels for oil extraction and water purification. The yields vary widely, depending on season, variety, fertilization, and irrigation regimen. Moringa yields best under warm, dry conditions with some supplemental fertilizer and irrigation.&lt;ref name=ted/&gt; Harvest is done manually with knives, sickles, and stabs with hooks attached.&lt;ref name=ted/&gt; [[Pollarding]], [[coppicing]], and lopping or [[pruning]] are recommended to promote branching, increase production, and facilitate harvesting.&lt;ref name="pollarding"&gt;{{cite book |last=Grubben |first1=G |url=https://books.google.com/?id=6jrlyOPfr24C&amp;lpg=PA394&amp;dq=pollarding%20moringa&amp;pg=PA394#v=onepage&amp;q=pollarding%20moringa&amp;f=false |title=Vegetables |volume=2 |edition=Plant resources of tropical Africa |editor-last=Grubben |editor-first= G. J. H. |page=394 |isbn=978-9057821479 |accessdate=2015-02-02 |year=2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Fruits ===
When the plant is grown from cuttings, the first harvest can take place 6–8 months after planting. Often, the fruits are not produced in the first year, and the yield is generally low during the first few years. By year two, it produces around 300 pods, by year three around 400–500. A good tree can yield 1000 or more pods.&lt;ref&gt;Booth, F.E.M.; Wickens, G.E., 1988: Non-timber Uses of Selected Arid Zone Trees and Shrubs in Africa, p.98, FAO, Rome "[http://www.fao.org/docrep/006/t0044e/T0044e16.htm]".Retrieved 20-11-2013.&lt;/ref&gt; In India, a hectare can produce 31 tons of pods per year.&lt;ref name=ted/&gt; Under North Indian conditions, the fruits ripen during the summer. Sometimes, particularly in South India, flowers and fruit appear twice a year, so two harvests occur, in July to September and March to April.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/BF02858648 |title=Drumstick (Moringa oleifera): A multipurpose Indian vegetable |year=1980 |last1=Ramachandran |first1=C. |last2=Peter |first2=K. V. |last3=Gopalakrishnan |first3=P. K. |journal=Economic Botany |volume=34 |issue=3 |pages=276–283}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Leaves ===
Average yields of 6 tons/ha/year in fresh matter can be achieved. The harvest differs strongly between the rainy and dry seasons, with 1120&amp;nbsp;kg/ha per harvest and 690&amp;nbsp;kg/ha per harvest, respectively. The leaves and stems can be harvested from the young plants 60 days after seeding and then another seven times in the year. At every harvest, the plants are cut back to within 60&amp;nbsp;cm of the ground.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Moringa Leaf Farming Systems: Conditions for Profitability and Sustainability|author=Sogbo, K. A. |year=2006 |url=http://www.moringanews.org/doc/GB/PowerPoint/Kokou_Sogbo_GB.pdf |accessdate=2013-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In some production systems, the leaves are harvested every 2 weeks.

The cultivation of ''M. oleifera'' can also be done intensively with irrigation and fertilization with suitable varieties.&lt;ref name="amaglo"&gt;{{cite web|title= How to Produce Moringa Leaves Efficiently?|author= Amaglo, N.|year=2006|url=http://www.moringanews.org/doc/GB/Groups/Group_2_Newton_text_GB.pdf|accessdate=2013-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trials in [[Nicaragua]] with 1 million plants per hectare and 9 cuttings/year over 4 years gave an average fresh matter production of 580 metric tons/ha/year, equivalent to about 174 metric tons of fresh leaves.&lt;ref name="amaglo"/&gt;

=== Oil ===
One estimate for yield of oil from kernels is 250 l/ha.&lt;ref name=ted/&gt; The oil can be used as a food supplement, as a base for cosmetics, and for hair and the skin.

==Pests and diseases==
The moringa tree is not affected by any serious diseases in its native or introduced ranges.  In India, several insect pests are seen, including various caterpillars such as the bark-eating [[caterpillar]], the hairy caterpillar or the green leaf caterpillar. The budworms [[Noctuidae]] are known to cause serious defoliation. Damaging agents can also be [[aphid]]s, stem borers, and fruit flies. In some regions, termites can also cause minor damage. If termites are numerous in soils, insects management costs are not bearable.&lt;ref name=parotta/&gt;

The moringa tree is a host to ''[[Leveillula taurica]]'', a powdery [[mildew]] which causes damage in papaya crops in south India. Cultivation management should therefore be checked.

== Culinary uses ==
{{Refimprove section|date=July 2015}} 
Moringa has numerous applications in cooking throughout its regional distribution. The fruits or seed pods, known as "drumsticks", are a culinary vegetable commonly used in soups and curries. The leaves are also commonly eaten with many culinary uses, and the flowers are featured in some recipes as well.

The long drumsticks are often cut into shorter lengths and stewed in [[curry|curries]] and soups. Because the outer skin is tough and fibrous, drumsticks are often chewed to extract the juices and nutrients, with the remaining fibrous material discarded. Others describe a slightly different method of sucking out the flesh and tender seeds and discarding the tube of skin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite podcast

}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Traditional dishes which commonly include drumsticks prepared this way include [[South Indian cuisine|South Indian]] ''[[sambar (dish)|sambar]]'' where it is stewed with lentils, and the [[Thai Cuisine|Thai]] dish ''[[kaeng som]]'' which is a sour curry with drumsticks and fish.

The leaves can be used in many ways, perhaps most commonly added to clear broth-based soups, such as the [[Filipino cuisine|Filipino dishes]] ''[[tinola]]'' and ''[[utan]]''. Tender moringa leaves, finely chopped, are used as garnish for vegetable dishes and salads, such as the [[Cuisine of Kerala|Kerala dish]] ''[[thoran]]''. It is also used in place of or along with [[coriander]].

In some regions of India, the flowers are mixed with [[gram flour]] and spices, then deep-fried into ''[[pakora]]s'' to be served as snacks or added to curries.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

{{orphan|date=June 2013}}

In [[mathematics]], an '''''N''-topological space''' is a set equipped with ''N'' arbitrary topologies. If ''τ''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''τ''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;...,&amp;nbsp;''τ''&lt;sub&gt;''N''&lt;/sub&gt; are ''N''&amp;nbsp;topologies defined on a nonempty set '''X''', then the ''N''-topological space is denoted by (''X'',''τ''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,''τ''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,...,''τ''&lt;sub&gt;''N''&lt;/sub&gt;).
For ''N''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1, the structure is simply a [[topological space]].
For ''N''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2, the structure becomes a [[bitopological space]] introduced by J. C. Kelly.&lt;ref name="J. C. Kelly"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kelly|first=J. C.|title=Bitopological spaces|journal=Proc. London Math. Soc.|year=1963|volume=13|issue=3|pages=71–89|doi=10.1112/plms/s3-13.1.71}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Example ==
Let ''X''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;{''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ...., ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;} be any finite set. Suppose ''A''&lt;sub&gt;''r''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;{''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''r''&lt;/sub&gt;}. Then the collection ''τ''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;{''φ'',&amp;nbsp;''A''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''A''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''A''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''X''} will be a topology on&amp;nbsp;''X''. If ''τ''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''τ''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''τ''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt; be ''m'' such topologies (chain topologies) defined on ''X'', then the structure (''X'', ''τ''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''τ''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''τ''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt;) is an '''''m''-topological space'''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6915">'''Operation ''Desert''''' ({{lang-de|Unternehmen Wüste}}) was a German [[synthetic fuel]] project during [[World War II]].  It attempted to build a [[shale oil]] industrial production complex for utilization of [[Swabian Alb]] [[oil shale]] deposits ([[Posidonia Shale]]).

The project was driven by the fuel needs of the German army at the last phase of World War II due to decreasing conventional [[petroleum]] supplies.  Three companies conducted pilot tests. ''LIAS-Ölschiefer-Forschungsgesellschaft mbH'', established in September 1942, started tests in [[Frommern]].&lt;ref name="holoch 232"&gt;[[#holoch|Holoch (1978)]], p. 232&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Kohle-Öl-Union von Busse KG'', established on 30 July 1943 in Berlin, tested ''in-situ'' retorting on the outskirts of [[Schömberg, Zollernalbkreis|Schörzingen]].&lt;ref name="holoch 232"/&gt;&lt;ref name="megargee 1012"&gt;[[#megargee|Megargee (2009)]], p. 1012&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Deutsche Ölschiefer-Forschungsgesellschaft mbH'', established on 20 September 1943 in Schömberg, became later the core of the Operation ''Desert''.&lt;ref name="megargee 1012"/&gt;  ''[[Schutzstaffel]]'' (SS) and [[Hermann Göring]] personally became involved in the project in late 1943.

For the Operation ''Desert'' construction of ten [[shale oil extraction]] plants in [[Württemberg]] and [[Province of Hohenzollern|Hohenzollern]] were ordered by [[Edmund Geilenberg]]. Prisoners from seven nearby [[Nazi concentration camps|subcamps]] of the [[Natzweiler-Struthof concentration camp]], established by the route of  Tübingen - Aulendorf and Nebenstrecke Balingen- Rottweil railway lines, were used as a workforce.&lt;ref name="KZ Natzweiler"/&gt; The main contractor for building these plants was ''Deutsche Bergwerks- und Hüttenbau GmbH'', a subsidiary of ''[[Reichswerke Hermann Göring]]''. About 5,000&amp;nbsp;prisoners were used for construction works and more than 10,000&amp;nbsp;prisoners had been exploited for the oil-shale works.  When the Soviet troops advance into Estonia in 1944, about 200&amp;nbsp;oil shale specialists from Estonia, employees of ''Baltische Öl GmbH '', an affiliate of IG Farben, were evacuated to [[Schömberg, Zollernalbkreis|Schömberg]].&lt;ref name="holmberg 130"&gt;[[#holmberg|Holmberg (2008)]], pp. 130-131&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="aili kogerman"&gt;

However, out of ten planned plants only four became operational. The technology was primitive [[carbonization]] and [[Yield (chemistry)|oil yield]] was low.  Mined oil shale was heaped into [[mound]]s which were ignited after covering by [[peat]].&lt;ref name="aili kogerman"/&gt; [[Distillation|Distilled]] shale oil and oil shale gas were collected through {{convert|300|mm|adj=on}} perforated pipes. Oil was separated from gas by electric filters.  Until the end of the war, only 1,500&amp;nbsp;tonnes of shale oil was produced.

After the war [[Allied-occupied Germany|French occupation forces]] tried continue the shale oil production operations but due to unprofitability it was halted in 1948.&lt;ref name=schule&gt;

The '''Saturn Relay''' is a minivan that was made by General Motors. It was introduced for the 2005 model year, and was built alongside its sisters, the [[Buick Terraza]], the [[Chevrolet Uplander]], and the [[Pontiac Montana SV6]] in [[Doraville, Georgia]]. The Relay was the first Saturn vehicle without [[polymer]] side paneling, the first Saturn that is a [[badge engineering|rebadged]] [[Chevrolet]] or [[Pontiac]], and it was the first (and only) minivan produced by Saturn.

The Relay was introduced with a 3.5&amp;nbsp;[[litre|L]] [[GM High Value engine#LX9|LX9]] [[V6]] that generates {{convert|200|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|220|lbft|Nm|abbr=on}} torque, going from 0-60&amp;nbsp;mph in the 9-second range. For 2006, a 3.9&amp;nbsp;L [[GM High Value engine#LZ9|LZ9]] V6, with 240&amp;nbsp;hp (179&amp;nbsp;kW) and 240&amp;nbsp;lb·ft (332 Nm) torque, was added as an option, which delivered faster acceleration and better response than the 3.5L engine. For 2007, the 3.5&amp;nbsp;L V6 was dropped, leaving the 3.9&amp;nbsp;L as the base engine. Consequently, the optional [[Four-wheel drive|AWD]] system was also dropped, since it could not handle the torque of the 3.9&amp;nbsp;L engine. Also in 2007, the Relay received an optional [[flexible fuel|flex-fuel]] engine but only for fleet applications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2007 Saturn Relay|url=http://archives.media.gm.com/ca/gm/en/products/saturn/archives/2007Relay.html|publisher=[[General Motors]]|accessdate=30 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Relay scored three "Good"s (the highest possible score) and two "acceptable"s (the second highest possible score) in [[Insurance Institute for Highway Safety]] (IIHS) [[crash test]]s. In terms of [[gas mileage]], the Relay is rated at {{convert|19|mpgus }} city, {{convert|25|mpgus }} highway.

The Relay started at [[United States dollar|US$]]22,850. There were three available trim levels, ''1'', ''2'', ''3''. The Relay 3 was available in front-wheel drive and in all-wheel drive. All Relays seat seven via folding/removable 2nd row captains chairs and a 50/50 third-row bench. The third-row bench folds flat, but did not fold entirely into the floor. [[OnStar]] assistance and a [[DVD]] rear entertainment system came standard on all Relays. A navigation system was optional on Relay 3s. Side airbags were optional on the Relay. The Relay was discontinued after the 2007 model year and was replaced by the 2007 [[Saturn Outlook]].

==Changes==

===2006===
2006 models added the GM logos on the front doors.

===2007===
The final model year of the Relay. The Saturn logos had been dropped from the front doors, and the [[all-wheel drive]] option was no longer available. The Relay was discontinued after the 2007 model year. The [[Doraville Assembly]] plant closed in September 2008. The last 2007 Relay rolled off the line on November 17, 2006. The Relay was replaced by the 8-passenger, Lambda-based [[Saturn Outlook]] [[crossover SUV]].

A '''solar-powered watch''' or '''light-powered watch''' is a [[watch]] that is powered entirely or partly by a [[solar cell]].

Some of the early solar watches of the 1970s had innovative and unique designs to accommodate the array of [[photovoltaic]] solar cells needed to power them (Synchronar, Nepro, Sicura and some models by Cristalonic, Alba, Rhythm, Seiko and Citizen). In the 1990s, [[Citizen Watch Co., Ltd|Citizen]] started to sell light-powered watches under the [[Eco-Drive]] series name. Since their introduction, photovoltaic devices have greatly improved their efficiency and thereby their capacity. Watchmakers have developed their technology such that solar-powered watches are now a major part of their range of watches. Several other watch manufacturers offer similar watches or are developing such technology. These other watch manufacturers include (amongst others) [[Junghans]], [[Casio]], [[Seiko]], and [[Orient Watch|Orient]].&lt;ref name="orient_light_powered"&gt;[http://www.orient-watch.com/products/category/?category_id=9 Orient Light-Powered Watches (Global Market)], Accessed 28 September 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="orient_light_powered2"&gt;[http://www.orient-watch.com/img/manuals/AHc.pdf Orient Light-Powered Watches &amp; Movement Manual (Global Market)], Accessed 28 September 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="orient_light_powered3"&gt;[http://www.orient-watch.com/support/manuals/ List of Orient Watch Manual &amp; Movement (Global Market)], Accessed 28 September 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="orient_light_powered_japan"&gt;[http://www.orient-watch.jp/product/category/?category_id=62 Orient Light-Powered Watches (Japan Domestic Market)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141008162740/http://www.orient-watch.jp/product/category/?category_id=62 |date=2014-10-08 }}, Accessed 28 September 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="orient_light_powered_ladies_japan"&gt;[http://www.orient-watch.jp/product/category/?category_id=68 Orient Light-Powered Ladies Watches (Japan Domestic Market)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141008162756/http://www.orient-watch.jp/product/category/?category_id=68 |date=2014-10-08 }}, Accessed 8 October 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="orient_light_powered4"&gt;[http://www.orient-watch.jp/support/manuals/ List of Orient Watch Manual &amp; Movement (Japan Domestic Market)], Accessed 28 September 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

Typically, sunlight and artificial light are absorbed by a solar panel behind the crystal. The dial is either on a layer above or actually on the solar panel. This solar panel converts the light into electrical energy to power the watch. The watch will usually store energy in a rechargeable cell to power itself during the night or when covered such as a wearer's clothing (e.g., sleeve). Citizen's watches use [[lithium-ion batteries]] to store sufficient energy to power the watch for several months/years without light exposure, by allowing the watch to enter a power-saving or hibernation mode during which the seconds hand stops until the watch is re-exposed to light.  Not all have a power-save mode, yet will still hold a charge for typically six months, as with uncomplicated (date only) analog versions made by Citizen.

Inexpensive solar-powered watches were first sold in the 1980s and were popular amongst children, often featuring famous fictional characters such as [[Transformers]] or [[G.I. Joe]].{{citation needed|date=August 2009}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6103">The '''spinning drop method''' (rotating drop method) is one of the methods used to measure [[Surface tension|interfacial tension]]. Measurements are carried out in a rotating horizontal tube which contains a dense fluid. A drop of a less dense liquid or a gas bubble is placed inside the fluid. Since the rotation of the horizontal tube creates a [[centrifugal force]] towards the tube walls, the liquid drop will start to deform into an elongated shape; this elongation stops when the interfacial tension and centrifugal forces are balanced. The surface tension between the two liquids (for bubbles: between the fluid and the gas) can then be derived from the shape of the drop at this [[equilibrium point]]. A device used for such measurements is called a “spinning drop tensiometer”.

The spinning drop method is usually preferred for the accurate measurements of surface tensions below 10&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt; mN/m. It refers to either using the fluids with low interfacial tension or working at very high angular velocities. This method is widely used in many different applications such as measuring the interfacial tension of polymer blends&lt;ref name=hujoseph&gt;{{cite journal|author1=H.H. Hu |author2=D.D. Joseph |journal= J. Colloid Interface Sci.|volume= 162 |year=1994|pages= 331–339|doi=10.1006/jcis.1994.1047|title=Evolution of a Liquid Drop ''in a'' spinning Drop Tensiometer|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; and copolymers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=C.

== Theory ==
An approximate theory was developed by Bernard Vonnegut&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=B. Vonnegut|journal= Rev. Sci. Instrum.|volume= 13 |issue=6 |year=1942|pages= 6–9|doi=10.1063/1.1769937|title=Rotating Bubble Method for the Determination of Surface and Interfacial Tensions}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1942 to measure the surface tension of the fluids, which is based on the principle that the interfacial tension and centrifugal forces are balanced at [[mechanical equilibrium]]. This theory assumes that the droplet's length L is much greater than its radius R, so that it may be approximated as a straight circular cylinder.
 
 
[[Image:Mine1.JPG]]

The relation between the surface tension and [[angular velocity]] of a droplet can be obtained in different ways. One of them involves considering the total mechanical energy of the droplet as the summation of its [[kinetic energy]] and its surface energy:

:&lt;math&gt; E=E_k +\gamma_s &lt;/math&gt;

The kinetic energy of a cylinder of length L and radius R rotating about its central axis is given by

:&lt;math&gt; E_k=\frac{1}{2}I\omega^2=\frac{1}{4}mR^2\omega^2 &lt;/math&gt;

in which

:&lt;math&gt; I=\frac{1}{2}mR^2 &lt;/math&gt;

is the [[moment of inertia]] of a cylinder rotating about its central axis and ''ω'' is its angular velocity. 
The surface energy of the droplet is given by

:&lt;math&gt; \gamma_s=2\pi LR\sigma=\frac{2V}{R}\sigma &lt;/math&gt;

in which V is the constant volume of the droplet and ''σ'' is the interfacial tension. 
Then the total mechanical energy of the droplet is

:&lt;math&gt; E=E_k +\gamma_s=\frac{1}{4}\Delta\rho VR^2\omega^2+\frac{2V}{R}\sigma &lt;/math&gt;

in which Δ''ρ'' is the difference between the densities of the droplet and of the surrounding fluid.
At mechanical equilibrium, the mechanical energy is minimized, and thus

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dE}{dR}=0=\frac{1}{2}\Delta\rho VR\omega^2-\frac{2V}{R^2}\sigma&lt;/math&gt;

Substituting in

:&lt;math&gt; V=\pi LR^2 &lt;/math&gt;

for a cylinder and then solving this relation for interfacial tension yields

:&lt;math&gt; \sigma=\frac{\Delta\rho\omega^2}{4}R^3 &lt;/math&gt;

This equation is known as Vonnegut’s expression. Interfacial tension of any liquid that gives a shape very close to a cylinder at steady state, can be estimated using this equation. The straight cylindrical shape will always develop for sufficiently high ω; this typically happens for ''L''/''R'' &gt; 4.&lt;ref name=hujoseph /&gt;  Once this shape has developed, further increasing ω will decrease ''R'' while increasing ''L'' keeping ''LR&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;'' fixed to meet conservation of volume.

== New developments after 1942 ==
The full mathematical analysis on the shape of spinning drops was done by Princen and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=|title=Measurement of Interfacial Tension from the Shape of a Rotating Drop|journal= Journal of Colloid and Interface Science|doi=10.1016/0021-9797(67)90090-2|year=1967|last1=Princen|first1=H|last2=Zia|first2=I|last3=Mason|first3=S|volume=23|pages=99}}&lt;/ref&gt; Progress in numerical algorithms and available computing resources turned solving the non linear implicit parameter equations to a pretty much 'common' task, which has been tackled by various authors and companies. The results are proving the Vonnegut restriction is no longer valid for the spinning drop method.

== Comparison with other methods ==
The spinning drop method is convenient compared to other widely used methods for obtaining interfacial tension, because contact angle measurement is not required. Another advantage of the spinning drop method is that it is not necessary to estimate the curvature at the interface, which entails complexities associated with shape of the fluid drop.

On the other hand, this theory suggested by Vonnegut, is restricted with the [[Rotational speed|rotational velocity]]. The spinning drop method is not expected to give accurate results for high surface tension measurements, since the centrifugal force that is required to maintain the drop in a cylindrical shape is much higher in the case of liquids that have high interfacial tensions.

The '''Sunbury Research Centre''' -- also known as ICBT Sunbury -- is a main [[research institute]] of [[BP]] in north-east [[Surrey]].

==History==
It began in 1917 as the Sunbury Research Station. Research began with the employment of two chemists to look into the [[viscosity]] of [[fuel oil]] for the [[Navy]] in the [[First World War]], and the production of [[toluene]]. In the 1920s research took place into [[Fluid catalytic cracking|cracking]], at the plant at [[Uphall]] in [[Scotland]] ([[West Lothian]]). The first new building opened in July 1931. 76 staff were there in 1929, 99 in 1934 and 197 in 1939. 

By the 1950s, BP Research was in a 39-acre site in Sunbury.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Yl2uvI_5Dt0C&amp;pg=PA27&amp;lpg=PA27 New Scientist November 1957]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Geophysics|Geophysical]] research had also taken place at [[Kirklington Hall Research Station]] in [[Nottinghamshire]], until 1957. Around 1958, the site was expanded with a new Physics laboratory and five other buildings. A [[linear particle accelerator|Linear electron accelerator]] was installed. By early 1958, Kirklington Hall had been sold.

Products that the [[British Petroleum Company]] made in the 1950s were BP Motor Spirit and BP [[Energol]] (''visco-static'' [[motor oil]]). But Britain would not produce much oil of its own until the mid-1970s when [[North Sea oil]] arrived at the [[Forties Oil Field]]. 

===Construction===
Three new buildings were built from 1998 as part of Phase 1. Since 2001, four new buildings were built as part of Phase 2.

==Structure==
It is situated off the [[A244 road|A244]] (via the [[A308 road|A308]]) in the north of [[Sunbury-on-Thames]], and Surrey, on the Surrey boundary with London. To the east nearby is Sunbury Common.

The retail division of BP UK is at [[Witan Gate House]]. BP employs around 15,000 people in the UK.

It has an [[enhanced oil recovery]] [[laboratory]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bp.com/content/dam/bp/pdf/bp-magazine/bp-magazine-2014-issue-2.pdf BP Magazine 2014 Issue 2]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Star formation}}

'''T Tauri stars''' ('''TTS''') are a class of [[variable star]]s associated with [[star formation|youth]].  They are less than about ten million years old.&lt;ref name=appenzeller/&gt;  This class is named after the prototype, [[T Tauri]], a young star in the [[Taurus Molecular Cloud|Taurus star-forming region]]. They are found near [[molecular cloud]]s and identified by their optical [[variable star|variability]] and strong [[chromosphere|chromospheric]] lines.  T Tauri stars are [[pre-main-sequence star]]s in the process of contracting to the main sequence along the [[Hayashi track]], a luminosity–temperature relationship obeyed by infant stars of less than 3 [[solar masses]] ({{Solar mass|link=y}}) in the pre-main-sequence phase of [[stellar evolution]]. It ends when a star of {{Solar mass|0.5}} develops a [[radiative zone]], or when a larger star commences [[nuclear fusion]] on the [[main sequence]].

==History==
While [[T Tauri]] itself was discovered in 1852, the T Tauri class of stars were initially defined by [[Alfred Harrison Joy]] in 1945.&lt;ref name="Joy1945"/&gt;

==Characteristics==
T Tauri stars comprise the youngest visible F, G, K and M [[spectral type]] stars ({{Solar mass|&lt;2|link=y}}). Their surface temperatures are similar to those of [[main sequence|main-sequence]] stars of the same mass, but they are significantly more luminous because their radii are larger. Their central temperatures are too low for [[Proton-proton chain reaction|hydrogen fusion]]. Instead, they are powered by gravitational energy released as the stars contract, while moving towards the [[main sequence]], which they reach after about 100 million years. They typically rotate with a period between one and twelve days, compared to a month for the Sun, and are very active and variable.

There is evidence of large areas of [[starspot]] coverage, and they have intense and variable [[X-ray]] and [[radio]] emissions (approximately 1000 times that of the Sun). Many have extremely powerful [[stellar wind]]s; some eject gas in high-velocity [[Bipolar outflow|bipolar jets]]. Another source of brightness variability are clumps ([[protoplanet]]s and [[planetesimal]]s) in the disk surrounding T Tauri stars.

[[File:Hs-2000-32-a-animated gif.gif|thumb|The ejection of a bubble of hot gas from [[XZ Tauri]], a binary system of T Tauri stars. The scale is much larger than that of the Solar System.]]

Their spectra show a higher [[lithium]] abundance than the Sun and other main-sequence stars because lithium is destroyed at temperatures above 2,500,000 K. From a study of lithium abundances in 53 T Tauri stars, it has been found that lithium depletion varies strongly with size, suggesting that "[[lithium burning]]" by the [[Proton-proton chain reaction|P-P chain]], during the last highly convective and unstable stages during the later [[pre–main-sequence star|pre–main sequence]] phase of the [[Hayashi track|Hayashi contraction]] may be one of the main sources of energy for T Tauri stars. Rapid rotation tends to improve mixing and increase the transport of lithium into deeper layers where it is destroyed. T Tauri stars generally increase their rotation rates as they age, through contraction and spin-up, as they conserve angular momentum. This causes an increased rate of lithium loss with age. Lithium burning will also increase with higher temperatures and mass, and will last for at most a little over 100 million years. &lt;!-- The style "x Myr" is used once throughout the entire article, and moreover does not usually require explanation. Who wrote this paragraph, some kid trying to meet a word count requirement? --&gt;

The P-P chain for Lithium burning is as follows

&lt;!-- Autogenerated using Phykiformulae 0.12 [[User:SkyLined#Phykiformulae]]

|}

It will not occur in stars with less than sixty times the mass of Jupiter ({{Jupiter mass|link=y}}). In this way, the rate of lithium depletion can be used to calculate the age of the star.&lt;!--

section will need a rewrite, marking this spot with comments --&gt;

==Types ==
Several types of TTSs exist:&lt;ref name=wolk/&gt;
*Classical T Tauri star ('''CTTS''')
*Weak-line T Tauri star ('''WTTS''')
**Naked T Tauri star ('''NTTS'''), which is a subset of WTTS.

[[Image:M42proplyds.jpg|left|thumb|250px|[[Protoplanetary discs]] in the [[Orion Nebula]]]]
Roughly half of T Tauri stars have [[circumstellar disk]]s, which in this case are called [[protoplanetary discs]] because they are probably the progenitors of [[planetary system]]s like the Solar System. Circumstellar discs are estimated to dissipate on timescales of up to 10 million years. Most T Tauri stars are in [[binary star]] systems. In various stages of their life, they are called [[young stellar object|Young Stellar Objects]] (YSOs). It is thought that the active [[magnetic field]]s and strong [[solar wind]] of [[Alfvén waves]] of T Tauri stars are one means by which [[angular momentum]] gets transferred from the star to the protoplanetary disc. A T Tauri stage for the [[Solar System]] would be one means by which the angular momentum of the contracting [[Sun]] was transferred to the protoplanetary disc and hence, eventually to the [[planets]].

Analogs of T Tauri stars in the higher mass range (2–8 [[solar mass]]es)—A and B [[spectral type]] [[pre–main-sequence star]]s, are called [[Herbig Ae/Be star|Herbig Ae/Be-type stars]]. More massive (&gt;8 solar masses) [[star]]s in pre–main sequence stage are not observed, because they evolve very quickly: when they become visible (i.e. disperses surrounding circumstellar gas and dust cloud), the hydrogen in the center is already burning and they are [[main sequence]] objects.

==Planets==
Planets around T Tauri stars include: 
*[[HD 106906 b]] around an [[F-type main-sequence star|F-type]] star
*[[1RXS J160929.1−210524]] around a [[K-type main-sequence star|K-type]] star
*[[Gliese 674 b]] around an [[M-type main-sequence star|M-type]] star
*[[V830 Tau b]] around an [[M-type main-sequence star|M-type]] star
*[[PDS 70|PDS 70b]] around a [[K-type main-sequence star|K-type]] star

'''Thick-film dielectric electroluminescent''' ('''TDEL''') '''technology''' is a [[phosphor]]-based [[flat panel]] display [[technology]] developed by [[Canada|Canadian]] company iFire Technology Corp. TDEL is based on inorganic [[Electroluminescence|electroluminescent]] (IEL) technology and has a novel structure that combines both thick- and thin-film processes. An IEL device generates light by applying an alternating electrical field to inorganic light-emitting phosphors. Traditional IEL displays are bright, very fast in video response time and highly tolerant of environmental extremes. However, the lack of full-color capability and large-size scalability has limited their application for the mainstream consumer television market. iFire has addressed these limitations by replacing the thin-film dielectric of traditional IEL technology with its patented thick-film, high-K dielectric material and structure. The result is a unique flat panel display technology that provides iFire displays with high performance and low cost potential. iFire was unable to develop displays competitive with LCD, plasma and OLED devices and wound up research and development in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.westaim.com/Theme/Westaim/files/2006%20MDA%20-%20FINAL4%20-%20Feb%2015%2007%20with%20change%20from%20Board.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-05-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120323144001/http://www.westaim.com/Theme/Westaim/files/2006%20MDA%20-%20FINAL4%20-%20Feb%2015%2007%20with%20change%20from%20Board.pdf |archivedate=2012-03-23 |df= }} Westaim Corporation message from the board, February 8, 2007 retrieved 2011 May 11&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technology==

The TDEL structure is made on a glass or other inexpensive substrate consisting of a thick-film dielectric layer and a thin-film phosphor layer squished between two sets of electrodes to make a matrix of pixels. It seems complex, but basically it works when phosphors emit light in the presence of an electric field. And because TDEL uses solid-state phosphors instead of liquids (as with [[LCD]]s), gases (as with [[Plasma display|PDP]]) or vacuum (as with  the [[Cathode ray tube|CRT]]), it is probably the most sturdy new technology, less prone to shock and breakage during shipping.

===Color By Blue===

In 2003, iFire announced the development of a process, known as Color By Blue (CBB), which further simplified the already simple manufacturing process for TDEL. The simpler Color by Blue manufacturing process was made possible by performance improvements to iFire’s blue inorganic phosphor. The Color By Blue process achieves [[luminance]] and color superior to the previous triple pattern process, as well as increased contrast, better grayscale rendition and exceptional color uniformity across the panel.

Color By Blue is based on the physics of [[photoluminescence]]. With CBB, iFire’s high luminance inorganic blue phosphor is used in combination with special color conversion materials, which absorb the blue light and re-emit red or green light, to generate the other colors. This fluorescence is possible because the photons in blue light operate at higher frequencies than other light, and therefore have higher energy.  With optimum color-conversion materials the conversion factors and the color spectrum of the display will exceed the requirements of [[HDTV]] systems.

==Characteristics and market place==

Besides its durability, TDEL's claim to fame is its low cost of production. According to the makers, TDEL display would have half the capital and manufacturing costs of a similar LCD or PDP.

iFire claims TDEL also has picture quality similar to CRT TVs. The displays are brighter, more efficient, more resistant to contamination during manufacturing, and more resistant to electrical breakdown than their thin-film counterpart (TFEL), but with less dark contrast and contrast in bright lighting.
iFire has moved on from a 17-inch prototype to a 34-inch full-colour display.

Following pilot manufacturing, iFire expected to begin commercial volume production with capacity in the range of 250,000 units per year. Initial planning work for a volume facility is underway and iFire is reviewing its commercialization strategy with potential manufacturing partners.

iFire ceased research in 2007 and all physical and intellectual property assets were sold in 2009.

===Pros===

* Fast video response time and long life.
* The display's simple solid state architecture, insensitivity to [[operating temperature]] extremes.
* Scalability and low-cost manufacturing.

===Cons===
* Unavailable and production stalled

A '''titanium sublimation pump''' (TSP) is a type of [[vacuum pump]] used to remove residual gas in  [[ultra high vacuum]] systems, maintaining the vacuum.

== Principle of operation ==
Its construction and principle of operation is simple. It consists of a [[titanium]] filament through which a high current (typically around 40 Amps) is passed periodically. This current causes the filament to reach the [[Sublimation (phase transition)|sublimation]] temperature of titanium, and hence the surrounding chamber walls become coated with a thin film of clean titanium. Since clean titanium is very reactive, components of the residual gas in the chamber which collide with the chamber wall are likely to react and to form a stable, solid product. Thus the gas pressure in the chamber is reduced.&lt;ref name=vacgen&gt;[http://www.thermovacgen.com/asp/catalogue.asp?url=http%3A//www.thermovacgen.com/catalogue/section-7/page07_16.htm&amp;frame=1 VG Scienta] retrieved 8 April 2009&lt;/ref&gt;
But after some time, the titanium film will no longer be clean and hence the effectiveness of the pump is reduced. Therefore, after a certain time, the titanium filament should be heated again, and a new film of titanium re-deposited on the chamber wall. Since the time taken for the titanium film to react depends on a number of factors (such as the composition of the residual gas, the temperature of the chamber and the total pressure), the period between successive sublimations requires some consideration. Typically, the operator does not know all of these factors, so the sublimation period is estimated according to the total pressure and by observing the effectiveness of the outcome. Some TSP controllers use a signal from the pressure gauge to estimate the appropriate period.

Since the TSP filament has a finite lifetime, TSPs commonly have multiple filaments to allow the operator to switch to a new one without needing to open the chamber. Replacing used filaments can then be combined with other maintenance jobs.&lt;ref name=vacgen/&gt;

The effectiveness of the TSP depends on a number of factors. Amongst the most critical are; the area of the titanium film, the temperature of the chamber walls and the composition of the residual gas. The area is typically maximised when considering where to mount the TSP. The reactivity of the new titanium film is increased at lower temperatures, so it is desirable to cool the relevant part of the chamber, typically using liquid nitrogen. However, due to the cost of the nitrogen and the need to ensure a continuous supply, TSPs are commonly operated at room temperature. Finally the residual gas composition is important - typically the pump works well with the more reactive components (such as [[Carbon monoxide|CO]] and [[Oxygen|O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]]), but is very ineffective at pumping inert components such as the noble gasses.&lt;ref name=vacgen/&gt; Therefore, TSP must be used in conjunction with other pumps.

Other pumps which use exactly the same working principle, but using something other than titanium as a source are also relatively common. This family of pumps are usually called '[[getter]] pumps' or 'getters' and typically consist of metals which are reactive with the components of the residual gas which are not pumped by the TSP. By choosing a number of such sources, most constituents of the residual gas, except for the noble gases, can be targeted.

==Practical considerations==
When mounting the TSP in the chamber, a number of important considerations must be made. First, it is desirable that the filament can deposit on a large area. However, one must take care that the titanium is not deposited onto anything it can damage. For example, electrical feedthroughs containing ceramic insulators will fail if the titanium forms a conducting film which bridges the ceramic insulator. Samples may become contaminated by titanium if they have line-of-sight to the pump. Also, titanium is a very hard material, so titanium film which builds up on the inside of the chamber may form flakes which fall into mechanical components (typically [[turbomolecular pump]]s and valves) and damage them.

Many chambers containing TSPs also have an [[ion pump (physics)|ion pump]]. Often the ion pump provides a good location for the TSP, and some manufacturers promote the use of combined TSP/ion-pumps.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.varianinc.com/cgi-bin/nav?products/vacuum/pumps/ion/combo/index&amp;cid=KNILPPQHFM Varian Inc, "ion sublimation pump"] retrieved 8 April 2009{{Dead link|date=October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, TSPs have been shown to be effective against the regurgitation effects of ion pumps.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first1=P.A. |last1=Redhead |first2=J.P. |last2=Hobson |first3=E.V. |last3=Kornelsen |title=The Physical Basis of Ultrahigh Vacuum |isbn=1-56396-122-9 |publisher=[[American Institute of Physics|AIP]] |place=New York |year=1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Victorian Model Solar Challenge.jpg|thumb|Solar powered boats racing at the Victorian Model Solar Vehicle Challenge at Scienceworks, Melbourne.]]
The '''Victorian Model Solar Vehicle Challenge''' is a competition held annually at [[Scienceworks (Melbourne)|Scienceworks]] in [[Melbourne]], Australia.  The challenge gives school age children a chance to design and build a car or boat, and more recently a Mars Rover, that operates solely on [[solar power]].  It is run by MSV, a voluntary organisation created to administer the challenge.

== History ==
A 'solar car challenge for schools' was first thought of in 1987 during the first World Solar Challenge.  Everyone who attended—car makers, staff and students from universities and secondary schools—believed it to be a great experience.  Two men, Paul Wellington (teacher at Chisholm Institute of Technology, part of Monash University), and Ted Mellor (Warragul Technical School), felt that such an opportunity should be available to a wider range of students, because at the time, the high cost of making a life-size solar car meant that only rich schools could afford it.  Thus, it was decided that a competition for model solar cars would be created; model cars being much cheaper and less time-consuming to make than life-size cars, but still requiring the same amount of thought and skill.  Paul and Ted assembled a team of science and technology teachers, curriculum developers, sponsors, representatives and former World Solar Challenge team members (today known as MSV), and with the financial support of Energy Victoria, they established a Model Solar Car Challenge in Victoria.  The first race was run in May 1990, at the Exhibition Buildings in Melbourne.

== Sponsors ==
The Sponsors of the event are as follows:
*[[Swinburne University of Technology]]
*[[Scienceworks Museum (Melbourne)|Scienceworks Museum]], who have hosted the event since 1991
*[[City of Boroondara]]
*[[Engineers Australia]]

The '''Western HVDC Link''' is a [[high-voltage direct current]] (HVDC) electrical link between [[Hunterston]] in Western Scotland and [[Flintshire Bridge]] ([[Connah's Quay]]) in [[North Wales]], routed to the west of the [[Isle of Man]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.westernhvdclink.co.uk/news-detail.aspx?newsID=120&lt;/ref&gt; It has a transmission capacity of 2,200&amp;nbsp;[[watt|MW]], and was expected to cost £1bn. The link entered operational service on 7 December 2017 at an initial reduced capacity of 900 MW pending further work at Hunterston.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Welcome|url=http://www.westernhvdclink.co.uk/default.aspx|website=Western Link|accessdate=5 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It entered full use in October 2018.

It consists of {{convert|422|km}} of cable, of which {{convert|385|km}} is underwater.&lt;ref name=westernhvdclink-QA&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.westernhvdclink.co.uk/qanda.aspx |title=Q&amp;A |publisher=Western HVDC |accessdate=28 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the first subsea link at 600 kV.&lt;ref name=westernhvdclink-mc/&gt; Operating at this higher voltage increases transmission capacity and reduces transmission losses in the cable, reducing power loss from transmission and two AC/DC conversions to under 3%.&lt;ref name=siemens-20120208&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://www.siemens.co.uk/en/news_press/index/news_archive/siemens-to-increase-power-transmission-capacity-between-england-and-scotland.htm |title=Siemens to increase power transmission capacity between England and Scotland |publisher=Siemens |date=8 February 2012 |accessdate=21 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are two cables, which in shallow water are laid in a paired bundle, and in deep water laid about 30 metres apart, generally buried about 1.5 metres below the seabed. The cables are jointed in 120&amp;nbsp;km sections.&lt;ref name=westernhvdclink-mc&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.westernhvdclink.co.uk/marine-cable.aspx |title=Marine cable |publisher=Western HVDC |accessdate=28 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Line commutated converter technology is used at each [[HVDC converter]] to maximise the capacity of electrical power, generated predominantly by renewable sources in Scotland, which can be transferred across the B6 boundary&lt;ref group=notes&gt;The UK transmission grid is often analysed in terms of flows across fictitious "boundaries" which divide the network in two. Where the lines which across a boundary struggle to accommodate projected flows, the boundary needs strengthening. Though most boundaries do not correspond to geographic or political features, the B6 boundary runs along the England/Scotland border.&lt;/ref&gt; in parallel to two existing double-circuit [[Alternate current|AC]] transmission lines. This type of HVDC conversion technology means that large filter halls are required at each converter station.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.westernhvdclink.co.uk/hunterston-converter-station.aspx |title=Hunterston converter station &amp; cable |website=Western Link}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Switchgear#Gas|Gas-insulated switchgear]] is used at the Hunterston converter station to save space.

Routing the connection through the [[Irish Sea]] as opposed to a land-based route limits the impact of the link on the visual environment and circumnavigates potential problems associated with the rising cost of land on the overall project costs. For the given distance, it is necessary to use a DC transmission technology for a subsea route, as the capacitive current required for an AC connection would be too high. Due to the proximity of converter stations to the coastline, a decision was taken to host electrical infrastructure within built structures in order to reduce the effects of the coastal air on sensitive electrical assets.

Power can be transferred in either direction (which might become more likely due to the closure of [[Longannet power station]]), but it is necessary for the link to be offline for a sufficient time prior to reversing the direction. Mass impregnated non-draining (MIND) cables are used in a bipolar arrangement, but no sea- or earth-return path is permitted for environmental reasons, meaning that both cables must be in service for the link to be operational. The cables are spaced apart to minimise thermal interference, but not so far as to materially impact any marine life which navigates using [[Earth's magnetic field|the magnetic field of the Earth]].

Completion was delayed a year due to cable manufacturing problems.&lt;ref name=newpower-20170704&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.newpower.info/2017/07/western-hvdc-link-completion-delayed-until-next-year/ |title=Western HVDC link completion delayed until next year |last=Andrews |first=Annabel |website=New Power |date=4 July 2017 |accessdate=21 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1071">'''Wiggleboard''' is a special kind of [[plywood]]-like wood that is designed to be bent along one of its two axes, also known as "bendable plywood" or "bending plywood".

Unlike regular plywood that has the [[Wood grain|grains]] running at right angles to each other in each layer, wiggleboard has all the grains running the same way, and is designed to be easily rolled up or bent along one axis, and stiff along another axis that is at right angles to that one axis.

It can be used to quickly make any developable surface.

[[File:Study of a Bearded and Turbaned Man Carrying a Chest MET DP837789.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Man with wooden box or chest, 1625]]
A '''wooden box''' is a [[Packaging|container]] made of [[wood]] for storage or as a [[shipping container]].  

Construction may include several types of wood; [[lumber]] (timber), [[plywood]], [[engineered wood]]s, etc.  For some purposes, decorative woods are used.  

==Boxes as [[shipping containers]]==

Wooden [[box]]es are often used for heavy duty [[packaging]] when 
* high strength is needed for heavy and difficult loads
* long term warehousing may be needed
* large size is required
* rigidity
* when stacking strength is critical

Boxes and [[crate]]s are not the same. If the sheathing of the container (plywood, lumber, etc.) can be removed, and a framed structure will remain standing, the container would likely be termed a crate. If removal of the sheathing resulted in there being no way of fastening the lumber around the edges of the container, the container would likely be termed a wooden box.

The strength of a wooden box is rated based on the weight it can carry before the cap (top, ends, and sides) is installed. "Skids" or thick bottom runners, are sometimes specified to allow forklift trucks access for lifting.

Performance is strongly influenced by the specific design, type of wood, type of fasteners ([[nail (fastener)|nails]], etc.), workmanship, etc.

Some boxes have [[package handle|handles]], ''hand holes'', or ''hand holds''.

===Nailed wood box===

A nailed wooden box is constructed of pieces of lumber (sometimes with reinforcing battens, cleats, etc.) attached by [[nail (fastener)|nails]] or other suitable fasteners. It usually completely encloses the contents.  A box usually has a bottom and four side panels and often has an attachable top.

===Cleated  box===
A cleated box has five or six panel faces with wood strips attached to them.  The panels can be made of [[plywood]], solid or [[corrugated fiberboard]], etc.  Wooden cleats reinforce the panels.

===Wirebound box===
Very thin lumber is used for a wirebound box.  Wires are [[Staple (fastener)|stapled]] or stitched to the girth and to wood cleats.  These are sometimes used for [[produce]] and for heavy loose items for military or export use.  These are lighter than wood boxes or crates.  They have excellent tensile strength to contain items but not much stacking strength.

===Skid box===
{{main|Bulk box}}

A skid box is a wood, [[corrugated fiberboard]], or metal box attached to a heavy duty [[pallet]] or platform on a skid (parallel wood runners)
