An '''algebraic solution''' or '''solution in radicals''' is a [[closed-form expression]], and more specifically a closed-form [[algebraic expression]], that is the solution of an [[algebraic equation]] in terms of the coefficients, relying only on [[addition]], [[subtraction]], [[multiplication]], [[Division (mathematics)|division]], raising to integer powers, and the extraction of [[nth root]]s (square roots, cube roots, and other integer roots). 

The most well-known example is the solution 

:&lt;math&gt;
x=\frac{-b \pm \sqrt {b^2-4ac\  }}{2a},&lt;/math&gt;

introduced in secondary school, of the [[quadratic equation]]

:&lt;math&gt;ax^2 + bx + c =0&lt;/math&gt;

(where ''a'' ≠ 0).

There exist more complicated algebraic solutions for the general [[cubic equation]]&lt;ref&gt;Nickalls, R. W. D., "[http://img2.timg.co.il/forums/1_90809354.pdf A new approach to solving the cubic: Cardano's solution revealed]," ''Mathematical Gazette'' 77, November 1993, 354-359.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[quartic equation]].&lt;ref&gt;Carpenter, William, "On the solution of the real quartic," ''Mathematics Magazine'' 39, 1966, 28-30.&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Abel–Ruffini theorem]]&lt;ref&gt;Jacobson, Nathan (2009), Basic Algebra 1 (2nd ed.), Dover, {{ISBN|978-0-486-47189-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|211}} states that the general [[quintic equation]] lacks an algebraic solution, and this directly implies that the general polynomial equation of degree ''n'', for ''n'' ≥ 5, cannot be solved algebraically. However, for ''n''  ≥ 5, some polynomial equations have algebraic solutions; for example, the equation &lt;math&gt;x^{10} = a&lt;/math&gt; can be solved as &lt;math&gt;x=a^{1/10}.&lt;/math&gt; See {{slink|Quintic function|Other solvable quintics}} for various other examples in degree 5.

[[Évariste Galois]] introduced a criterion allowing one to decide which equations are solvable in radicals. See [[Radical extension]] for the precise formulation of his result.

Algebraic solutions form a subset of [[closed-form expression]]s, because the latter permit [[transcendental function]]s (non-algebraic functions) such as the exponential function, the logarithmic function, and the trigonometric functions and their inverses.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6991">In algebra, an '''alternating polynomial''' is a [[polynomial]] &lt;math&gt;f(x_1,\dots,x_n)&lt;/math&gt; such that if one switches any two of the variables, the polynomial changes sign:
:&lt;math&gt;f(x_1,\dots,x_j,\dots,x_i,\dots,x_n) = -f(x_1,\dots,x_i,\dots,x_j,\dots,x_n).&lt;/math&gt;
Equivalently, if one [[permutes]] the variables, the polynomial changes in value by the [[sign of a permutation|sign of the permutation]]:
:&lt;math&gt;f\left(x_{\sigma(1)},\dots,x_{\sigma(n)}\right)= \mathrm{sgn}(\sigma) f(x_1,\dots,x_n).&lt;/math&gt;

More generally, a polynomial &lt;math&gt;f(x_1,\dots,x_n,y_1,\dots,y_t)&lt;/math&gt; is said to be ''alternating in'' &lt;math&gt;x_1,\dots,x_n&lt;/math&gt; if it changes sign if one switches any two of the &lt;math&gt;x_i&lt;/math&gt;, leaving the &lt;math&gt;y_j&lt;/math&gt; fixed.&lt;ref&gt;''Polynomial Identities and Asymptotic Methods,'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=ZLW_Kz_zOP8C&amp;pg=PA12&amp;lpg=PA12&amp;dq=%22alternating+polynomial%22 p. 12]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relation to symmetric polynomials==
Products of [[symmetric polynomial|symmetric]] and alternating polynomials (in the same variables &lt;math&gt;x_1,\dots,x_n&lt;/math&gt;) behave thus:
* the product of two symmetric polynomials is symmetric,
* the product of a symmetric polynomial and an alternating polynomial is alternating, and
* the product of two alternating polynomials is symmetric.

This is exactly the addition table for [[parity (mathematics)|parity]], with "symmetric" corresponding to "even" and "alternating" corresponding to "odd". Thus, the direct sum of the spaces of symmetric and alternating polynomials forms a [[superalgebra]] (a &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{Z}_2&lt;/math&gt;-[[graded algebra]]), where the symmetric polynomials are the even part, and the alternating polynomials are the odd part.
This grading is unrelated to the grading of polynomials by [[degree of a polynomial|degree]].

In particular, alternating polynomials form a [[module (mathematics)|module]] over the algebra of symmetric polynomials (the odd part of a superalgebra is a module over the even part); in fact it is a free module of rank&amp;nbsp;1, with as generator the [[Vandermonde polynomial]] in ''n'' variables.

If the [[Characteristic of a ring|characteristic]] of the coefficient [[ring (mathematics)|ring]] is 2, there is no difference between the two concepts: the alternating polynomials are precisely the symmetric polynomials.

==Vandermonde polynomial==
{{main|Vandermonde polynomial}}

The basic alternating polynomial is the [[Vandermonde polynomial]]:
:&lt;math&gt;v_n = \prod_{1\le i&lt;j\le n} (x_j-x_i).&lt;/math&gt;
This is clearly alternating, as switching two variables changes the sign of one term and does not change the others.&lt;ref&gt;Rather, it only rearranges the other terms: for &lt;math&gt;n=3&lt;/math&gt;, switching &lt;math&gt;x_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x_2&lt;/math&gt; changes &lt;math&gt;(x_2-x_1)&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;(x_1-x_2) = -(x_2-x_1)&lt;/math&gt;, and exchanges &lt;math&gt;(x_3-x_1)&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;(x_3-x_2)&lt;/math&gt;, but does not change their sign.&lt;/ref&gt;

The alternating polynomials are exactly the Vandermonde polynomial times a symmetric polynomial: &lt;math&gt;a = v_n \cdot s&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; is symmetric.
This is because:
* &lt;math&gt;v_n&lt;/math&gt; is a factor of every alternating polynomial: &lt;math&gt;(x_j-x_i)&lt;/math&gt; is a factor of every alternating polynomial, as if &lt;math&gt;x_i=x_j&lt;/math&gt;, the polynomial is zero (since switching them does not change the polynomial, we get
:&lt;math&gt;f(x_1,\dots,x_i,\dots,x_j,\dots,x_n) = f(x_1,\dots,x_j,\dots,x_i,\dots,x_n) = -f(x_1,\dots,x_i,\dots,x_j,\dots,x_n),&lt;/math&gt;
:so &lt;math&gt;(x_j-x_i)&lt;/math&gt; is a factor), and thus &lt;math&gt;v_n&lt;/math&gt; is a factor.
* an alternating polynomial times a symmetric polynomial is an alternating polynomial; thus all multiples of &lt;math&gt;v_n&lt;/math&gt; are alternating polynomials

Conversely, the ratio of two alternating polynomials is a symmetric function, possibly rational (not necessarily a polynomial), though the ratio of an alternating polynomial over the Vandermonde polynomial is a polynomial.
[[Schur polynomial]]s are defined in this way, as an alternating polynomial divided by the Vandermonde polynomial.

===Ring structure===
Thus, denoting the ring of symmetric polynomials by Λ&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;, the ring of symmetric and alternating polynomials is &lt;math&gt;\Lambda_n[v_n]&lt;/math&gt;, or more precisely &lt;math&gt;\Lambda_n[v_n]/\langle v_n^2-\Delta\rangle&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\Delta=v_n^2&lt;/math&gt; is a symmetric polynomial, the [[discriminant]].

That is, the ring of symmetric and alternating polynomials is a [[quadratic extension]] of the ring of symmetric polynomials, where one has adjoined a square root of the discriminant.

Alternatively, it is:
:&lt;math&gt;R[e_1,\dots,e_n,v_n]/\langle v_n^2-\Delta\rangle.&lt;/math&gt;

If 2 is not invertible, the situation is somewhat different, and one must use a different polynomial &lt;math&gt;W_n&lt;/math&gt;, and obtains a different relation; see Romagny.

==Representation theory==
{{details|Representation theory of the symmetric group}}
From the perspective of [[representation theory]], the symmetric and alternating polynomials are subrepresentations of [[Representation theory of the symmetric group|the action of the symmetric group]] on ''n'' letters on the polynomial ring in ''n'' variables. (Formally, the symmetric group acts on ''n'' letters, and thus acts on derived objects, particularly [[free object]]s on ''n'' letters, such as the ring of polynomials.)

The symmetric group has two 1-dimensional representations: the trivial representation and the sign representation. The symmetric polynomials are the trivial representation, and the alternating polynomials are the sign representation. Formally, the scalar span of any symmetric (resp., alternating) polynomial is a trivial (resp., sign) representation of the symmetric group, and multiplying the polynomials tensors the representations.

In characteristic 2, these are not distinct representations, and the analysis is more complicated.

If &lt;math&gt;n&gt;2&lt;/math&gt;, there are also other subrepresentations of the action of the symmetric group on the ring of polynomials, as discussed in [[representation theory of the symmetric group]].

==Unstable==
Alternating polynomials are an unstable phenomenon (in the language of [[stable homotopy theory]]): the ring of symmetric polynomials in ''n'' variables can be obtained from the ring of symmetric polynomials in arbitrarily many variables by evaluating all variables above &lt;math&gt;x_n&lt;/math&gt; to zero: symmetric polynomials are thus ''stable'' or ''compatibly defined.'' However, this is not the case for alternating polynomials, in particular the [[Vandermonde polynomial]].

'''Carlos Ginzburg''' is a [[conceptual artist]] and theoretician born in 1946 in [[La Plata]], [[Argentina]]. He studied [[philosophy]] and social theory.

==Biography==

[[Germano Celant]], when writing about [[Arte Povera]], invited Ginzburg by letter to join his movement.

As a conceptual artist interested in [[digital art]], [[fractals]] [[chaos theory|chaos]] and [[fractal art]], Ginzburg created what he calls "homo fractalus" – a concept about microcosm totality.&lt;ref&gt;http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/leonardo/v034/34.1ginzburg.html The Leonardo Gallery : Carlos Ginzburg&lt;/ref&gt;

He has worked with the art critic [[Pierre Restany]] (with whom he developed the concept of "Political Ecology")&lt;ref&gt;Curator Pierre Restany, Political Ecology, White Box, New York, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; and with [[Severo Sarduy]] who put him near [[Hokusai]] in "Barroco", one of the reference's books to ''Le Pli'' of [[Gilles Deleuze]].

He lives in Paris and works, since 2005, with the art criticism and French artist [[KolbaSha/Tschann]] on chaos's destruction and advent paradise.

'''Chaotic cryptology''' includes two integral opposite parts: '''Chaotic cryptography''' and '''Chaotic [[cryptanalysis]]'''. Chaotic cryptography is the application of the mathematical [[chaos theory]] to the practice of the [[cryptography]], the study or techniques used to privately and securely transmit information with the presence of a third-party or adversary. Since first being investigated by [[Robert_Matthews_(scientist)|Robert Matthews]] in 1989 &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/0161-118991863745 "On the derivation of a “chaotic” encryption algorithm." Matthews, R.A.J. ''Cryptologia'' 13, no. 1 (1989): 29-42.]&lt;/ref&gt;, the use of chaos in cryptography has attracted much interest; however, long-standing concerns about its security and implementation speed continue to limit its implementation.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/0161-119191865821 "Supercomputer investigations of a chaotic encryption algorithm" DD Wheeler, RAJ Matthews ''Cryptologia'' 15 (2), 140-152]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chen|first=Yong|last2=Liao|first2=Xiaofeng|date=2005-07-25|title=Cryptanalysis on a modified Baptista-type cryptosystem with chaotic masking algorithm|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0375960105007693|journal=Physics Letters A|volume=342|issue=5–6|pages=389–396|doi=10.1016/j.physleta.2005.05.048|bibcode=2005PhLA..342..389C}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Xie|first=Eric Yong|last2=Li|first2=Chengqing|last3=Yu|first3=Simin|last4=Lü|first4=Jinhu|date=2017-03-01|title=On the cryptanalysis of Fridrich's chaotic image encryption scheme|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165168416302651|journal=Signal Processing|volume=132|pages=150–154|doi=10.1016/j.sigpro.2016.10.002|arxiv=1609.05352}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Akhavan|first=A.|last2=Samsudin|first2=A.|last3=Akhshani|first3=A.|date=2015-09-01|title=Cryptanalysis of "an improvement over an image encryption method based on total shuffling"|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0030401815002801|journal=Optics Communications|volume=350|pages=77–82|doi=10.1016/j.optcom.2015.03.079|bibcode=2015OptCo.350...77A}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Akhavan|first=A.|last2=Samsudin|first2=A.|last3=Akhshani|first3=A.|date=2017-10-01|title=Cryptanalysis of an image encryption algorithm based on DNA encoding|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0030399216308635|journal=Optics &amp; Laser Technology|volume=95|pages=94–99|doi=10.1016/j.optlastec.2017.04.022|bibcode=2017OptLT..95...94A}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to use chaos theory efficiently in cryptography, the chaotic maps should be implemented such that the entropy generated by the map can produce required [[Confusion and diffusion]]. Properties in chaotic systems and [[cryptographic primitive]]s share unique characteristics that allow for the chaotic systems to be applied to cryptography.&lt;ref name="Baptista 50–54"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Baptista|first=M.S.|title=Cryptography with chaos|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0375960198000863|journal=Physics Letters A|language=en|volume=240|issue=1–2|pages=50–54|doi=10.1016/s0375-9601(98)00086-3|year=1998|bibcode=1998PhLA..240...50B}}&lt;/ref&gt; If chaotic parameters, as well as cryptographic keys, can be mapped symmetrically or mapped to produce acceptable and functional outputs, it will make it next to impossible for an adversary to find the outputs without any knowledge of the initial values. Since chaotic maps in a real life scenario require a set of numbers that are limited, they may, in fact, have no real purpose in a cryptosystem if the chaotic behavior can be predicted. One of the most important issues for any cryptographic primitive is the security of the system. However, in numerous cases, chaos-based cryptography algorithms are proved unsecure.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Li II–708–II-711 vol.2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Li|first=Shujun|last2=Zheng|first2=Xuan|date=2002-01-01|title=Cryptanalysis of a chaotic image encryption method|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1011451/|journal=2002 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems.

== Chaos-based Hash Function ==

== Chaos-based Random Number Generation ==
The unpredictable behavior of the chaotic maps can be used in the generation of random numbers. Some of the earliest chaos-based random number generators tried to directly generate random numbers from the logistic map.

| Unlimited&lt;ref group="p"&gt;RadioGatún is an Extendable-Output Function which means it has an output of unlimited size.  The official test vectors are 256-bit hashes.  RadioGatún claims to have the security level of a cryptographic [[sponge function]] 19 words in size, which means the 32-bit version has the security of a 304-bit hash when looking at [[preimage attack]]s, but the security of a 608-bit hash when looking at [[collision attack]]s.  The 64-bit version, likewise, has the security of a 608-bit or 1216-bit hash.  For the purposes of determining how vulnerable RadioGatún is to [[length extension attack]]s, only two words of its 58-word state are output between hash compression operations.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4877">In [[graph theory]] the '''conductance''' of a [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]] ''G''=(''V'',''E'') measures how "well-knit" the graph is: it controls how fast a [[random walk]] on ''G'' converges to a [[Uniform distribution (discrete)|uniform distribution]]. The conductance of a graph is often called the [[Cheeger constant (graph theory)|Cheeger constant]] of a graph as the 
analog of its [[Cheeger constant|counterpart]] in [[spectral geometry]].{{fact|date=May 2010}} Since [[electrical networks]] are intimately related to [[random walk]]s
with a long history in the usage of the term "conductance", this alternative name helps avoid possible confusion.

The conductance of a [[Cut (graph theory)|cut]] &lt;math&gt;(S, \bar S)&lt;/math&gt; in a graph is defined as:

:&lt;math&gt;\varphi(S) = \frac{\sum_{i \in S, j \in \bar S}a_{ij}}{\min(a(S),a(\bar S))}&lt;/math&gt;

where the &lt;math&gt;a_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; are the entries of the [[adjacency matrix]] for ''G'', so that

:&lt;math&gt;a(S) = \sum_{i \in S} \sum_{j \in V} a_{ij}&lt;/math&gt;

is the total number (or weight) of the edges incident with ''S''. &lt;math&gt;a(S)&lt;/math&gt; is also called a volume of the set &lt;math&gt;S \subseteq V&lt;/math&gt;.

The conductance of the whole graph is the minimum conductance over all the possible cuts:

: &lt;math&gt;\phi(G) = \min_{S \subseteq V}\varphi(S).&lt;/math&gt;

Equivalently, conductance of a graph is defined as follows: 

: &lt;math&gt;\phi(G) := \min_{S \subseteq V; 0\leq a(S)\leq a(V)/2}\frac{\sum_{i \in S, j \in \bar S}a_{ij}}{a(S)}.\,&lt;/math&gt;

For a ''d''-regular graph, the conductance is equal to the [[isoperimetric number]] divided by ''d''.

==Generalizations and applications==
In practical applications, one often considers the conductance only over a cut. A common generalization of conductance is to handle the case of weights assigned to the edges: then the weights are added; if the weight is in the form of a resistance, then the reciprocal weights are added.

The notion of conductance underpins the study of [[percolation]] in physics and other applied areas; thus, for example, the permeability of petroleum through porous rock can be modeled in terms of the conductance of a graph, with weights given by pore sizes.

Conductance also helps measure the quality of a [[Spectral clustering]]. The maximum among the conductance of clusters provides a bound which can be used, along with inter-cluster edge weight, to define a measure on the quality of clustering. Intuitively, the conductance of a cluster(which can be seen as a set of vertices in a graph) should be low. Apart from this, the conductance of the subgraph induced by a cluster(called "internal conductance") can be used as well.

==Markov chains==

For an [[ergodic]] reversible [[Markov chain]] with an underlying [[Graph (data structure)|graph]] ''G'', the conductance is a way to measure how hard it is to leave a small set of nodes.  Formally, the conductance of a graph is defined as the minimum over all sets &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; of the [[flow network|capacity]] of &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; divided by the [[ergodic flow]] out of &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;.  [[Alistair Sinclair]] showed that conductance is closely tied to [[markov chain mixing time|mixing time]] in ergodic reversible Markov chains.  We can also view conductance in a more probabilistic way, as the minimal probability of leaving a small set of nodes given that we started in that set to begin with.  Writing &lt;math&gt;\Phi_S&lt;/math&gt; for the conditional probability of leaving a set of nodes S given that we were in that set to begin with, the conductance is the minimal &lt;math&gt;\Phi_S&lt;/math&gt; over sets &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; that have a total stationary probability of at most 1/2. 

Conductance is related to [[Markov chain mixing time]] in the reversible setting.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2515">In [[control theory]], the '''cross Gramian''' (&lt;math&gt;W_X&lt;/math&gt;, also referred to by &lt;math&gt;W_{CO}&lt;/math&gt;) is a [[Gramian]] matrix used to determine how [[controllability|controllable]] and [[observability|observable]] a linear system is.&lt;ref name="FortunaFransca2012"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fortuna|first1=Luigi|last2=Fransca|first2=Mattia|title=Optimal and Robust Control: Advanced Topics with MATLAB|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WM3OzyHKlD4C&amp;pg=PA83|accessdate=29 April 2013|year=2012|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=9781466501911|pages=83–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="antoulas05"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Antoulas|first1=Athanasios C.|title=Approximation of Large-Scale Dynamical Systems|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1137/1.9780898718713|year=2005|publisher=SIAM|isbn=9780898715293}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the stable [[Time-invariant system|time-invariant]] linear system 

:&lt;math&gt;\dot{x} = A x + B u \, &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;y = C x \, &lt;/math&gt;

the cross Gramian is defined as:

:&lt;math&gt;W_X := \int_0^\infty e^{At} BC e^{At} dt \,&lt;/math&gt;

and thus also given by the solution to  the [[Sylvester equation]]:

:&lt;math&gt;A W_X + W_X A = -BC \, &lt;/math&gt;

The triple &lt;math&gt;(A,B,C)&lt;/math&gt; is [[Controllability|controllable]] and [[Observability|observable]] if and only if the matrix &lt;math&gt;W_X&lt;/math&gt; is [[nonsingular]], (i.e. &lt;math&gt;W_X&lt;/math&gt; has full rank, for any &lt;math&gt;t &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;).

If the associated system &lt;math&gt;(A,B,C)&lt;/math&gt; is furthermore symmetric, such that there exists a transformation &lt;math&gt;J&lt;/math&gt; with

:&lt;math&gt;AJ = JA^T \, &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;B = JC^T \, &lt;/math&gt;

then the [[absolute value]] of the [[eigenvalue]]s of the cross Gramian equal [[Hankel singular value]]s:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fernando|first=K.|last2=Nicholson|first2=H.|date=February 1983|title=On the structure of balanced and other principal representations of SISO systems|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1103195/|journal=IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control|volume=28|issue=2|pages=228–231|doi=10.1109/tac.1983.1103195|issn=0018-9286}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;|\lambda(W_X)| = \sqrt{\lambda(W_C W_O)}. \, &lt;/math&gt;

Thus the direct truncation of the [[singular value decomposition]] of the cross Gramian allows [[model order reduction]] (see [http://modelreduction.org]) without a balancing procedure as opposed to [[balanced truncation]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3330">In [[mathematics]], '''Freiman's theorem''' is a [[combinatorial]] result in [[additive number theory]]. In a sense it accounts for the approximate structure of sets of [[integer]]s that contain a high proportion of their internal sums, taken two at a time.

The formal statement is:

Let ''A'' be a finite set of integers such that the [[sumset]]

:&lt;math&gt;A + A&lt;/math&gt;

is small, in the sense that

:&lt;math&gt;|A + A| &lt; c|A|&lt;/math&gt;

for some constant &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt;. There exists an [[generalized arithmetic progression|''n''-dimensional arithmetic progression]] of length

:&lt;math&gt;c' |A|&lt;/math&gt;

that contains ''A'', and such that ''c''' and ''n'' depend only on ''c''.&lt;ref&gt;Nathanson (1996) p.251&lt;/ref&gt;

A simple instructive case is the following. We always have

:&lt;math&gt;|A + A| \ge 2|A|-1&lt;/math&gt;

with equality precisely when ''A'' is an arithmetic progression.

This result is due to [[Gregory Freiman]] (1964,1966).&lt;ref&gt;Nathanson (1996) p.252&lt;/ref&gt;  Much interest in it, and applications, stemmed from a new proof by [[Imre Z. Ruzsa]] (1994).  [[Mei-Chu Chang]] proved new polynomial estimates for the size of arithmetic progressions arising in the theorem in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=2002|title=A polynomial bound in Freiman's theorem|url=|journal=Duke Math. J.|volume=113|pages=399–419|mr=1909605|last1=Chang|first1=Mei-Chu|number=3|doi=10.1215/s0012-7094-02-11331-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Green and Ruzsa (2007) generalized the theorem for arbitrary [[abelian group]]s: here ''A'' can be contained in the sum of a generalized arithmetic progression and a [[subgroup]] — the name of such sets is [[coset]]-[[coset-progression|progression]].

Every finite-dimensional Banach space has a pair of opposite points on the unit sphere that achieves the minimum distance, and a centrally symmetric simple closed curve that achieves the minimum length. However, such a curve may not always exist in infinite-dimensional spaces.&lt;ref name="s67"/&gt;

The girth is always at least four, because the shortest path on the unit sphere between two opposite points cannot be shorter than the length-two line segment connecting them through the origin of the space. A Banach space for which it is exactly four is said to be ''flat''. There exist flat Banach spaces of infinite dimension in which the girth is achieved by a minimum-length curve; an example is the space ''C''[0,1] of continuous functions from the [[unit interval]] to the [[real number]]s, with the [[sup norm]]. The unit sphere of such a space has the counterintuitive property that certain pairs of opposite points have the same distance within the sphere that they do in the whole space.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="41098">'''Granular computing''' (GrC) is an emerging [[computing]] paradigm of [[information processing]] that concerns the processing of complex information entities called "information [[granulation|granules]]", which arise in the process of data abstraction and [[knowledge extraction|derivation of knowledge]] from information or data.  Generally speaking, information granules are collections of entities that usually originate at the numeric level and are arranged together due to their [[Similarity measure|similarity]], functional or physical adjacency, indistinguishability, coherency, or the like.

At present, granular computing is more a ''theoretical perspective'' than a coherent set of methods or principles.  As a theoretical perspective, it encourages an approach to data that recognizes and exploits the knowledge present in data at various levels of resolution or scales.  In this sense, it encompasses all methods which provide flexibility and adaptability in the resolution at which knowledge or information is extracted and represented.

== Types of granulation ==
[[File:Catarina 26 mar 2004 1310Z.jpg|thumb|upright=1.10|Satellite view of cyclone.]] 
[[File:NASA Manhattan.jpg|thumb|upright=1.10|Satellite view of Manhattan.]] 
As mentioned above, ''granular computing'' is not an algorithm or process; there is no particular method that is called "granular computing".  It is rather an approach  to looking at data that recognizes how different and interesting regularities in the data can appear at different levels of granularity, much as different features become salient in [[satellite images]] of greater or lesser resolution.  On a low-resolution satellite image, for example, one might notice interesting cloud patterns representing [[cyclones]] or other large-scale weather phenomena, while in a higher-resolution image, one misses these large-scale atmospheric phenomena but instead notices smaller-scale phenomena, such as the interesting pattern that is the streets of [[Manhattan]].  The same is generally true of all data: At different resolutions or granularities, different features and relationships emerge.  The aim of granular computing is to try to take advantage of this fact in designing more effective machine-learning and reasoning systems.

There are several types of granularity that are often encountered in [[data mining]] and [[machine learning]], and we review them below:

=== Value granulation (discretization/quantization) ===
One type of granulation is the [[Quantization (signal processing)|quantization]] of variables.  It is very common that in data mining or machine-learning applications the resolution of variables needs to be ''decreased'' in order to extract meaningful regularities.  An example of this would be a variable such as "outside temperature" (&lt;math&gt;temp&lt;/math&gt;), which in a given application might be recorded to several decimal places of [[Arithmetic precision|precision]] (depending on the sensing apparatus).  However, for purposes of extracting relationships between "outside temperature" and, say, "number of health-club applications" (&lt;math&gt;club &lt;/math&gt;), it will generally be advantageous to quantize "outside temperature" into a smaller number of intervals.

==== Motivations ====
There are several interrelated reasons for granulating variables in this fashion:
* Based on prior [[domain knowledge]], there is no expectation that minute variations in temperature (e.g., the difference between {{convert|80|-|80.7|°F|C|1}}) could have an influence on behaviors driving the number of health-club applications.  For this reason, any "regularity" which our learning algorithms might detect at this level of resolution would have to be ''spurious'', as an artifact of overfitting.  By coarsening the temperature variable into intervals the difference between which we ''do'' anticipate (based on prior domain knowledge) might influence  number of health-club applications, we eliminate the possibility of detecting these spurious  patterns.  Thus, in this case, reducing resolution is a method of controlling [[overfitting]].
* By reducing the number of intervals in the temperature variable (i.e., increasing its ''grain size''), we increase the amount of sample data indexed by each interval designation.  Thus, by coarsening the variable, we increase sample sizes and achieve better statistical estimation.  In this sense, increasing granularity provides an antidote to the so-called ''[[curse of dimensionality]]'', which relates to the exponential decrease in statistical power with increase in number of dimensions or variable cardinality.
*Independent of prior domain knowledge, it is often the case that meaningful regularities (i.e., which can be detected by a given learning methodology, representational language, etc.) may exist at one level of resolution and not at another.

[[File:Value granulation.png|thumb|200 px|Benefits of value granulation: Implications here exist at the resolution of &lt;math&gt;\{X_i,Y_j\}&lt;/math&gt; that do not exist at the higher resolution of &lt;math&gt;\{x_i,y_j\}&lt;/math&gt;; in particular, &lt;math&gt;\forall x_i,y_j: x_i \not\to y_j&lt;/math&gt;, while at the same time, &lt;math&gt;\forall X_i \exists Y_j: X_i \leftrightarrow Y_j&lt;/math&gt;.]]
For example, a simple learner or pattern recognition system may seek to extract regularities satisfying a [[conditional probability]] threshold such as &lt;math&gt;p(Y=y_j|X=x_i) \ge \alpha &lt;/math&gt;.  In the special case where &lt;math&gt;\alpha = 1 &lt;/math&gt;, this recognition system is essentially detecting ''[[logical implication]]'' of the form &lt;math&gt;X=x_i \rightarrow Y=y_j &lt;/math&gt; or, in words, "if &lt;math&gt;X=x_i&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;Y=y_j &lt;/math&gt;".  The system's ability to recognize such implications (or, in general, conditional probabilities exceeding threshold)  is partially contingent on the resolution with which the system analyzes the variables.

As an example of this last point, consider the feature space shown to the right.  The variables may each be regarded at two different resolutions.  Variable &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; may be regarded at a high (quaternary) resolution wherein it takes on the four values &lt;math&gt;\{x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4\}&lt;/math&gt; or at a lower (binary) resolution wherein it takes on the two values &lt;math&gt;\{X_1, X_2\}&lt;/math&gt;.  Similarly, variable &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; may be regarded at a high (quaternary) resolution or at a lower (binary) resolution, where it takes on the values &lt;math&gt;\{y_1, y_2, y_3, y_4\}&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\{Y_1, Y_2\}&lt;/math&gt;, respectively.  It will be noted that at the high resolution, there are '''no''' detectable implications of the form &lt;math&gt;X=x_i \rightarrow Y=y_j &lt;/math&gt;, since every &lt;math&gt;x_i&lt;/math&gt; is associated with more than one &lt;math&gt;y_j&lt;/math&gt;, and thus, for all &lt;math&gt;x_i&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;p(Y=y_j|X=x_i) &lt; 1 &lt;/math&gt;.  However, at the low (binary) variable resolution, two bilateral implications become detectable:    &lt;math&gt;X=X_1 \leftrightarrow Y=Y_1 &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;X=X_2 \leftrightarrow Y=Y_2 &lt;/math&gt;, since every &lt;math&gt;X_1&lt;/math&gt; occurs ''iff'' &lt;math&gt;Y_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;X_2&lt;/math&gt; occurs ''iff'' &lt;math&gt;Y_2&lt;/math&gt;.  Thus, a pattern recognition system scanning for implications of this kind would find them at the binary variable resolution, but would fail to find them at the   higher quaternary variable resolution.

====Issues and methods====
It is not feasible to exhaustively test all possible discretization resolutions on all variables in order to see which combination of resolutions yields interesting or significant results.  Instead, the feature space must be preprocessed (often by an [[information entropy|entropy]] analysis of some kind) so that some guidance can be given as to how the discretization process should proceed.  Moreover, one cannot generally achieve good results by naively analyzing and discretizing each variable independently, since this may obliterate the very interactions that we had hoped to discover.

A sample of papers that address the problem of variable discretization in general, and multiple-variable discretization in particular, is as follows: {{Harvtxt|Chiu|Wong|Cheung|1991}}, {{Harvtxt|Bay|2001}},  {{Harvtxt|Liu|Hussain|Tan|Dasii|2002}}, {{Harvtxt|Wang|Liu|1998}}, {{Harvtxt|Zighed|Rabaséda|Rakotomalala|1998}}, {{Harvtxt|Catlett|1991}}, {{Harvtxt|Dougherty|Kohavi|Sahami|1995}}, {{Harvtxt|Monti|Cooper|1999}}, {{Harvtxt|Fayyad|Irani|1993}}, {{Harvtxt|Chiu|Cheung|Wong|1990}}, {{Harvtxt|Nguyen|Nguyen|1998}}, {{Harvtxt|Grzymala-Busse|Stefanowski|2001}}, {{Harvtxt|Ting|1994}}, {{Harvtxt|Ludl|Widmer|2000}}, {{Harvtxt|Pfahringer|1995}}, {{Harvtxt|An|Cercone|1999}},

=== Variable granulation (clustering/aggregation/transformation) ===
Variable granulation is a term that could describe a variety of techniques, most of which are aimed at reducing dimensionality, redundancy, and storage requirements.  We briefly describe some of the ideas here, and present pointers to the literature.

====Variable transformation====
A number of classical methods, such as [[principal component analysis]], [[multidimensional scaling]], [[factor analysis]], and [[structural equation modeling]], and their relatives, fall under the genus of "variable transformation."  Also in this category are more modern areas of study such as [[dimensionality reduction]], [[projection pursuit]], and [[independent component analysis]].  The common goal of these methods in general is to find a representation of the data in terms of new variables, which are a linear or nonlinear transformation of the original variables, and in which important statistical relationships emerge. The resulting variable sets are almost always smaller than the original variable set, and hence these methods can be loosely said to impose a granulation on the feature space.  These dimensionality reduction methods are all reviewed in the standard texts, such as {{Harvtxt|Duda|Hart|Stork|2001}}, {{Harvtxt|Witten|Frank|2005}}, and {{Harvtxt|Hastie|Tibshirani|Friedman|2001}}.

====Variable aggregation====
A different class of variable granulation methods derive more from [[data clustering]] methodologies than from the linear systems theory informing the above methods.  It was noted fairly early that one may consider "clustering" related variables in just  the same way that one considers clustering related data.  In data clustering, one identifies a group of similar entities (using a "[[measure of similarity]]" suitable to the domain — {{Harvtxt|Martino|Giuliani|Rizzi|2018}}), and then in some sense ''replaces'' those entities with a prototype of some kind.  The prototype may be the simple average of the data in the identified cluster, or some other representative measure.  But the key idea is that in subsequent operations, we may be able to use the single prototype for the data cluster (along with perhaps a statistical model describing how exemplars are derived from the prototype) to ''stand in'' for the much larger set of exemplars.   These prototypes are generally such as to capture most of the information of interest concerning the entities.

[[File:Kraskov tree.png|thumb|400 px|A Watanabe-Kraskov variable agglomeration tree. Variables are agglomerated (or "unitized") from the bottom-up, with each merge-node representing a (constructed) variable having entropy equal to the joint entropy of the agglomerating variables. Thus, the agglomeration of two m-ary variables &lt;math&gt;X_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;X_2&lt;/math&gt; having individual entropies &lt;math&gt;H(X_1)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;H(X_2)&lt;/math&gt; yields a single &lt;math&gt;m^2&lt;/math&gt;-ary variable &lt;math&gt;X_{1,2}&lt;/math&gt; with entropy &lt;math&gt;H(X_{1,2})=H(X_1,X_2)&lt;/math&gt;. When &lt;math&gt;X_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;X_2&lt;/math&gt; are highly dependent (i.e., redundant) and have large mutual information &lt;math&gt;I(X_1;X_2)&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;H(X_{1,2})&lt;/math&gt; &amp;#x226A; &lt;math&gt;H(X_1)+H(X_2)&lt;/math&gt; because &lt;math&gt;H(X_1,X_2)=H(X_1)+H(X_2)-I(X_1;X_2)&lt;/math&gt;, and this would be considered a parsimonious unitization or aggregation.]]
Similarly, it is reasonable to ask whether a large set of variables might be aggregated into a smaller set of ''prototype'' variables that capture the most salient relationships between the variables.    Although variable clustering methods based on [[linear correlation]] have been proposed ({{Harvnb|Duda|Hart|Stork|2001}};{{Harvnb|Rencher|2002}}), more powerful methods of variable clustering are based on the [[mutual information]] between variables. Watanabe has shown ({{Harvnb|Watanabe|1960}};{{Harvnb|Watanabe|1969}}) that for any set of variables one can construct a ''polytomic'' (i.e., n-ary) tree representing a series of variable agglomerations in which the ultimate "total" correlation  among the complete variable set is the sum of the "partial" correlations exhibited by each agglomerating subset (see figure). Watanabe suggests that an observer might seek to thus partition a system in such a way as to minimize the interdependence between the parts "... as if they were looking for a natural division or a hidden crack."

One practical approach to building such a tree is to successively choose for agglomeration the two variables (either atomic variables or previously agglomerated variables) which have the highest pairwise mutual information {{Harv|Kraskov|Stögbauer|Andrzejak|Grassberger|2003}}. The product of each agglomeration is a new (constructed) variable that reflects the local [[joint distribution]] of the two agglomerating variables, and thus possesses an entropy equal to their [[joint entropy]].
(From a procedural standpoint, this agglomeration step involves replacing two columns in the attribute-value table—representing the two agglomerating variables—with a single column that has a unique value for every unique combination of values in the replaced columns {{Harv|Kraskov|Stögbauer|Andrzejak|Grassberger|2003}}.  No information is lost by such an operation; however, it should be noted that if one is exploring the data for inter-variable relationships, it would generally ''not'' be desirable to merge redundant variables in this way, since in such a context it is likely to be precisely the redundancy or ''dependency'' between variables that is of interest;  and once redundant variables are merged, their relationship to one another can no longer be studied.

=== System granulation (aggregation) ===

In [[database systems]], aggregations (see e.g. [[OLAP|OLAP aggregation]] and [[Business intelligence]] systems) result in transforming original data tables (often called information systems) into the tables with different semantics of rows and columns, wherein the rows correspond to the groups (granules) of original tuples and the columns express aggregated information about original values within each of the groups. Such aggregations are usually based on SQL and its extensions. The resulting granules usually correspond to the groups of original tuples with the same values (or ranges) over some pre-selected original columns.

There are also other approaches wherein the groups are defined basing on, e.g., physical adjacency of rows. For example, [[Infobright]] implemented a database engine wherein data was partitioned onto ''rough rows'', each consisting of 64K of physically consecutive (or almost consecutive) rows. Rough rows were automatically labeled with compact information about their values on data columns, often involving multi-column and multi-table relationships. It resulted in a higher layer of granulated information where objects corresponded to rough rows and attributes - to various aspects of rough information. Database operations could be efficiently supported within such a new framework, with an access to the original data pieces still available {{Slezak|Synak|Wojna|Wroblewski|2013}}.

=== Concept granulation (component analysis) ===
The origins of the ''granular computing'' ideology are to be found in the [[rough sets]] and [[fuzzy sets]] literatures.  One of the key insights of rough set research—although by no means unique to it—is that, in general, the selection of different sets of features or variables will yield different ''concept'' granulations.  Here, as in elementary rough set theory, by "concept" we mean a set of entities that are ''indistinguishable'' or ''indiscernible'' to the observer (i.e., a simple concept), or a set of entities that is composed from such simple concepts (i.e., a complex concept).  To put it in other words, by projecting a data set ([[value-attribute system]]) onto different sets of variables, we recognize alternative sets of equivalence-class "concepts" in the data, and these different sets of concepts will in general be conducive to the extraction of different relationships and regularities.

====Equivalence class granulation====
We illustrate with an example.  Consider the attribute-value system below:

:{| class="wikitable" style="text-align:center; width:30%" border="1"
|+ Sample Information System
! Object !! &lt;math&gt;P_{1}&lt;/math&gt; !! &lt;math&gt;P_{2}&lt;/math&gt; !! &lt;math&gt;P_{3}&lt;/math&gt; !! &lt;math&gt;P_{4}&lt;/math&gt; !! &lt;math&gt;P_{5}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
! &lt;math&gt;O_{1}&lt;/math&gt;
| 1 || 2 || 0 || 1 || 1
|-
! &lt;math&gt;O_{2}&lt;/math&gt;
| 1 || 2 || 0 || 1 || 1
|-
! &lt;math&gt;O_{3}&lt;/math&gt;
| 2 || 0 || 0 || 1 || 0
|-
! &lt;math&gt;O_{4}&lt;/math&gt;
| 0 || 0 || 1 || 2 || 1
|-
! &lt;math&gt;O_{5}&lt;/math&gt;
| 2 || 1 || 0 || 2 || 1
|-
! &lt;math&gt;O_{6}&lt;/math&gt;
| 0 || 0 || 1 || 2 || 2
|-
! &lt;math&gt;O_{7}&lt;/math&gt;
| 2 || 0 || 0 || 1 || 0
|-
! &lt;math&gt;O_{8}&lt;/math&gt;
| 0 || 1 || 2 || 2 || 1
|-
! &lt;math&gt;O_{9}&lt;/math&gt;
| 2 || 1 || 0 || 2 || 2
|-
! &lt;math&gt;O_{10}&lt;/math&gt;
| 2 || 0 || 0 || 1 || 0
|}

When the full set of attributes &lt;math&gt;P = \{P_{1},P_{2},P_{3},P_{4},P_{5}\}&lt;/math&gt; is considered, we see that we have the following seven equivalence classes or primitive (simple) concepts:

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{cases} 
\{O_{1},O_{2}\} \\ 
\{O_{3},O_{7},O_{10}\} \\ 
\{O_{4}\} \\ 
\{O_{5}\} \\
\{O_{6}\} \\
\{O_{8}\} \\
\{O_{9}\} \end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;

Thus, the two objects within the first equivalence class, &lt;math&gt;\{O_{1},O_{2}\}&lt;/math&gt;,  cannot be distinguished from one another based on the available attributes, and the three objects within the second equivalence class, &lt;math&gt;\{O_{3},O_{7},O_{10}\}&lt;/math&gt;, cannot be distinguished from one another based on the available attributes.  The remaining five objects are each discernible from all other objects.  Now, let us imagine a projection of the attribute value system onto attribute &lt;math&gt;P_{1}&lt;/math&gt; alone, which would represent, for example, the  view from an observer which is only capable of detecting this single attribute. Then we obtain the following much coarser equivalence class structure.

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{cases} 
\{O_{1},O_{2}\} \\ 
\{O_{3},O_{5},O_{7},O_{9},O_{10}\} \\ 
\{O_{4},O_{6},O_{8}\} \end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;

This is in a certain regard the same structure as before, but at a lower degree of resolution (larger grain size).  Just as in the case of [[#Value granulation (discretization/quantization)|value granulation (discretization/quantization)]], it is possible that relationships (dependencies) may emerge at one level of granularity that are not present at another.  As an example of this, we can consider the effect of concept granulation on the measure known as ''attribute dependency'' (a simpler relative of the [[mutual information]]).

To establish this notion of dependency (see also [[rough sets]]), let &lt;math&gt;[x]_Q = \{Q_1, Q_2, Q_3, \dots, Q_N \}&lt;/math&gt; represent a particular concept granulation, where each &lt;math&gt;Q_i&lt;/math&gt; is an equivalence class from the concept structure induced by attribute set &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt;.  For example, if the  attribute set &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; consists of attribute &lt;math&gt;P_{1}&lt;/math&gt; alone, as above,  then the concept structure &lt;math&gt;[x]_Q&lt;/math&gt; will be composed of    &lt;math&gt;Q_1 = \{O_{1},O_{2}\}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;Q_2 = \{O_{3},O_{5},O_{7},O_{9},O_{10}\}&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;Q_3 = \{O_{4},O_{6},O_{8}\}&lt;/math&gt;.  The '''dependency''' of attribute set &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; on another attribute set &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\gamma_{P}(Q)&lt;/math&gt;, is given by

:&lt;math&gt;
\gamma_{P}(Q) =  \frac{\left | \sum_{i=1}^N {\underline P}Q_i \right |} {\left | \mathbb{U} \right |} \leq 1
&lt;/math&gt;

That is, for each equivalence class &lt;math&gt;Q_i&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;[x]_Q&lt;/math&gt;, we add up the size of its "lower approximation" (see [[rough sets]]) by the attributes in &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;, i.e., &lt;math&gt;{\underline P}Q_i&lt;/math&gt;.  More simply, this approximation  is the number of objects which on attribute set &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; can be positively identified as belonging to target set &lt;math&gt;Q_i&lt;/math&gt;.  Added across all equivalence classes in &lt;math&gt;[x]_Q&lt;/math&gt;, the numerator above represents the total number of objects which—based on attribute set &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;—can be positively categorized according to the classification induced by  attributes &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt;.  The dependency ratio therefore expresses the proportion (within the entire universe) of such classifiable objects, in a sense capturing the "synchronization" of the two concept structures &lt;math&gt;[x]_Q&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;[x]_P&lt;/math&gt;.  The dependency &lt;math&gt;\gamma_{P}(Q)&lt;/math&gt; "can be interpreted as a proportion of such objects in the information system for which it suffices to know the values of attributes in &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; to determine the values of attributes in &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt;" (Ziarko &amp; Shan 1995).

Having gotten definitions now out of the way, we can make the simple observation that the choice of concept granularity (i.e., choice of attributes) will influence the detected dependencies among attributes.  Consider again the attribute value table from above:

:{| class="wikitable" style="text-align:center; width:30%" border="1"
|+ Sample Information System
! Object !! &lt;math&gt;P_{1}&lt;/math&gt; !! &lt;math&gt;P_{2}&lt;/math&gt; !! &lt;math&gt;P_{3}&lt;/math&gt; !! &lt;math&gt;P_{4}&lt;/math&gt; !! &lt;math&gt;P_{5}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
! &lt;math&gt;O_{1}&lt;/math&gt;
| 1 || 2 || 0 || 1 || 1
|-
! &lt;math&gt;O_{2}&lt;/math&gt;
| 1 || 2 || 0 || 1 || 1
|-
! &lt;math&gt;O_{3}&lt;/math&gt;
| 2 || 0 || 0 || 1 || 0
|-
! &lt;math&gt;O_{4}&lt;/math&gt;
| 0 || 0 || 1 || 2 || 1
|-
! &lt;math&gt;O_{5}&lt;/math&gt;
| 2 || 1 || 0 || 2 || 1
|-
! &lt;math&gt;O_{6}&lt;/math&gt;
| 0 || 0 || 1 || 2 || 2
|-
! &lt;math&gt;O_{7}&lt;/math&gt;
| 2 || 0 || 0 || 1 || 0
|-
! &lt;math&gt;O_{8}&lt;/math&gt;
| 0 || 1 || 2 || 2 || 1
|-
! &lt;math&gt;O_{9}&lt;/math&gt;
| 2 || 1 || 0 || 2 || 2
|-
! &lt;math&gt;O_{10}&lt;/math&gt;
| 2 || 0 || 0 || 1 || 0
|}

Let us consider the dependency of attribute set  &lt;math&gt;Q = \{P_4, P_5\}&lt;/math&gt;
on attribute set &lt;math&gt;P = \{P_2, P_3\}&lt;/math&gt;.  That is, we wish to know what proportion of objects can be correctly classified into classes of &lt;math&gt;[x]_Q&lt;/math&gt; based on knowledge of &lt;math&gt;[x]_P&lt;/math&gt;.  The equivalence classes of &lt;math&gt;[x]_Q&lt;/math&gt; and of &lt;math&gt;[x]_P&lt;/math&gt; are shown below.

:{| class="wikitable"
|-
! &lt;math&gt;[x]_Q&lt;/math&gt;
! &lt;math&gt;[x]_P&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| &lt;math&gt;
\begin{cases} 
\{O_{1},O_{2}\} \\ 
\{O_{3},O_{7},O_{10}\} \\ 
\{O_{4},O_{5},O_{8}\} \\
\{O_{6},O_{9}\}\end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;
| &lt;math&gt;
\begin{cases} 
\{O_{1},O_{2}\} \\ 
\{O_{3},O_{7},O_{10}\} \\ 
\{O_{4},O_{6}\} \\
\{O_{5},O_{9}\} \\
\{O_{8}\}\end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;
|}

The objects that can be ''definitively'' categorized according to concept structure &lt;math&gt;[x]_Q&lt;/math&gt; based on &lt;math&gt;[x]_P&lt;/math&gt; are those in the set &lt;math&gt;\{O_{1},O_{2},O_{3},O_{7},O_{8},O_{10}\}&lt;/math&gt;, and since there are six of these, the dependency of &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;,  &lt;math&gt;\gamma_{P}(Q) = 6/10&lt;/math&gt;.  This might be considered an interesting dependency in its own right, but perhaps in a particular data mining application only stronger dependencies are desired.

We might then consider the dependency of the smaller attribute set  &lt;math&gt;Q = \{P_4\}&lt;/math&gt;
on the attribute set &lt;math&gt;P = \{P_2, P_3\}&lt;/math&gt;.  The move from &lt;math&gt;Q = \{P_4, P_5\}&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;Q = \{P_4\}&lt;/math&gt; induces a coarsening of the class structure &lt;math&gt;[x]_Q&lt;/math&gt;, as will be seen shortly.  We wish again to know what proportion of objects can be correctly classified into the (now larger) classes of &lt;math&gt;[x]_Q&lt;/math&gt; based on knowledge of &lt;math&gt;[x]_P&lt;/math&gt;.  The equivalence classes of the new &lt;math&gt;[x]_Q&lt;/math&gt; and of &lt;math&gt;[x]_P&lt;/math&gt; are shown below.

:{| class="wikitable"
|-
! &lt;math&gt;[x]_Q&lt;/math&gt;
! &lt;math&gt;[x]_P&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| &lt;math&gt;
\begin{cases} 
\{O_{1},O_{2},O_{3},O_{7},O_{10}\} \\ 
\{O_{4},O_{5},O_{6},O_{8},O_{9}\} \end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;
| &lt;math&gt;
\begin{cases} 
\{O_{1},O_{2}\} \\ 
\{O_{3},O_{7},O_{10}\} \\ 
\{O_{4},O_{6}\} \\
\{O_{5},O_{9}\} \\
\{O_{8}\}\end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;
|}

Clearly, &lt;math&gt;[x]_Q&lt;/math&gt; has a coarser granularity than it did earlier.  The objects that can now be ''definitively'' categorized according to the concept structure &lt;math&gt;[x]_Q&lt;/math&gt; based on &lt;math&gt;[x]_P&lt;/math&gt; constitute the complete universe &lt;math&gt;\{O_{1},O_{2},\ldots,O_{10}\}&lt;/math&gt;, and thus  the dependency of &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;,  &lt;math&gt;\gamma_{P}(Q) = 1&lt;/math&gt;.  That is, knowledge of membership according to category set  &lt;math&gt;[x]_P&lt;/math&gt; is adequate to determine category membership in &lt;math&gt;[x]_Q&lt;/math&gt; with complete certainty; In this case we might say that &lt;math&gt;P \rightarrow Q&lt;/math&gt;.  Thus, by coarsening the concept structure, we were able to find a stronger (deterministic) dependency.  However, we also note that the classes induced in &lt;math&gt;[x]_Q&lt;/math&gt; from the reduction in resolution necessary to obtain this deterministic dependency are now themselves large and few in number; as a result, the dependency we found, while strong, may be less valuable to us than the weaker dependency found earlier under the higher resolution view of &lt;math&gt;[x]_Q&lt;/math&gt;.

In general it is not possible to test all sets of attributes to see which induced concept structures yield the strongest dependencies, and this search must be therefore be guided with some intelligence.  Papers which discuss this issue, and others relating to intelligent use of granulation, are those by Y.Y. Yao and [[Lotfi Zadeh]] listed in the [[#References]] below.

====Component granulation====
Another perspective on concept granulation may be obtained from work on parametric models of categories.  In [[mixture model]] learning, for example, a set of data is explained as a mixture of distinct [[Gaussian distribution|Gaussian]] (or other) distributions.  Thus, a large amount of data is "replaced" by a small number of distributions.  The choice of the number of these distributions, and their size, can again be viewed as a problem of ''concept granulation''.  In general, a better fit to the data is obtained by a larger number of distributions or parameters, but in order to extract meaningful patterns, it is necessary to constrain the number of distributions, thus deliberately  ''coarsening'' the concept resolution.  Finding the "right" concept resolution is a tricky problem for which many methods have been proposed (e.g., [[Akaike information criterion|AIC]], [[Bayesian information criterion|BIC]], [[Minimum description length|MDL]], etc.), and these are frequently  considered under the rubric of "[[model regularization]]".

==Different interpretations of granular computing==
Granular computing can be conceived as a framework of theories, methodologies, techniques, and tools that make use of information granules in the process of problem solving.  In this sense, granular computing is used as an umbrella term to cover topics that have been studied in various fields in isolation.  By examining all of these existing studies in light of the unified framework of granular computing and extracting their commonalities, it may be possible to develop a general theory for problem solving.

In a more philosophical sense, granular computing can describe a way of thinking that relies on the human ability to perceive the real world under various levels of granularity (i.e., abstraction) in order to abstract and consider only those things that serve a specific interest and to switch among different granularities. By focusing on different levels of granularity, one can obtain different levels of knowledge, as well as a greater understanding of the inherent knowledge structure.  Granular computing is thus essential in human problem solving and hence has a very significant impact on the design and implementation of intelligent systems.

* the endpoints of the arc associated with an edge &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt; are the points associated with the end vertices of &lt;math&gt;e,&lt;/math&gt;
* no arcs include points associated with other vertices,
* two arcs never intersect at a point which is interior to either of the arcs.
Here a surface is a [[compact space|compact]], [[connected space|connected]] &lt;math&gt;2&lt;/math&gt;-[[manifold]].

Informally, an embedding of a graph into a surface is a drawing of the graph on the surface in such a way that its edges may intersect only at their endpoints. It is well known that any finite graph can be embedded in 3-dimensional Euclidean space &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^3&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name="3d-gd"&gt;{{citation

Often, an '''embedding''' is regarded as an equivalence class (under homeomorphisms of &lt;math&gt;\Sigma&lt;/math&gt;) of representations of the kind just described.

Some authors define a weaker version of the definition of "graph embedding" by omitting the  non-intersection condition for edges. In such contexts the stricter definition is described as "non-crossing graph embedding".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first1=Naoki|last1=Katoh|first2=Shin-ichi|last2=Tanigawa|title=Computing and Combinatorics, 13th Annual International Conference, COCOON 2007, Banff, Canada, July 16-19, 2007, Proceedings|publisher=Springer-Verlag|series=[[Lecture Notes in Computer Science]]|volume=4598|year=2007|pages=243–253|doi=10.1007/978-3-540-73545-8_25|chapter=Enumerating Constrained Non-crossing Geometric Spanning Trees|isbn=978-3-540-73544-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

This article deals only with the strict definition of graph embedding. The weaker definition is discussed in the articles  "[[graph drawing]]" and "[[Crossing number (graph theory)|crossing number]]".

==Terminology==
If a graph &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is embedded on a closed surface &lt;math&gt;\Sigma&lt;/math&gt;, the complement of the union of the points and arcs associated with
the vertices and edges of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is a family of '''regions''' (or '''[[face (graph theory)|face]]s''').&lt;ref name="gt01"&gt;{{citation|last1=Gross|first1=Jonathan|last2=Tucker|first2=Thomas W.|authorlink2= Thomas W. Tucker| title=Topological Graph Theory|publisher=Dover Publications|year=2001|isbn=0-486-41741-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  A '''2-cell embedding''', '''cellular embedding''' or '''map''' is an embedding in which every face is homeomorphic to an open disk.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last1=Lando|first1=Sergei K.|last2=Zvonkin|first2=Alexander K.|title=Graphs on Surfaces and their Applications|publisher=Springer-Verlag|year=2004|isbn=3-540-00203-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  A '''closed 2-cell embedding''' is an embedding in which the closure of every face is homeomorphic to a closed disk.

The '''genus''' of a [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]] is the minimal integer &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; such that the graph can be embedded in a surface of [[Genus (mathematics)|genus]] &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;. In particular, a [[planar graph]] has genus &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;, because it can be drawn on a sphere without self-crossing. The '''non-orientable genus''' of a [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]] is the minimal integer &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; such that the graph can be embedded in a non-orientable surface of (non-orientable) genus &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="gt01"/&gt;

The '''Euler genus''' of a graph is the minimal integer &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; such that the graph can be embedded in an orientable surface of (orientable) genus &lt;math&gt;n/2&lt;/math&gt; or in a non-orientable surface of (non-orientable) genus &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;. A graph is '''orientably simple''' if its Euler genus is smaller than its non-orientable genus.

The '''maximum genus''' of a [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]] is the maximal integer &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; such that the graph can be &lt;math&gt;2&lt;/math&gt;-cell embedded in an orientable surface of [[Genus (mathematics)|genus]] &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;.

==Combinatorial embedding==
{{main|Rotation system}}
An embedded graph uniquely defines [[cyclic order|cyclic orders]] of edges incident to the same vertex. The set of all these cyclic orders is called a [[rotation system]]. Embeddings with the same rotation system are considered to be equivalent and the corresponding equivalence class of embeddings is called '''combinatorial embedding''' (as opposed to the term '''topological embedding''', which refers to the previous definition in terms of points and curves). Sometimes, the rotation system itself is called a "combinatorial embedding".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first1=Petra|last1=Mutzel|author1-link=Petra Mutzel|first2=René|last2=Weiskircher|title=Computing and Combinatorics, 6th Annual International Conference, COCOON 2000, Sydney, Australia, July 26–28, 2000, Proceedings|year=2000|publisher=Springer-Verlag|series=Lecture Notes in Computer Science|volume=1858|pages=95–104|doi=10.1007/3-540-44968-X_10|chapter=Computing Optimal Embeddings for Planar Graphs|isbn=978-3-540-67787-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Didjev|first=Hristo N.|contribution=On drawing a graph convexly in the plane|title=[[International Symposium on Graph Drawing|Graph Drawing, DIMACS International Workshop, GD '94, Princeton, New Jersey, USA, October 10–12, 1994, Proceedings]]|series=Lecture Notes in Computer Science|publisher=Springer-Verlag|year=1995|volume=894|pages=76–83|doi=10.1007/3-540-58950-3_358}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first1=Christian|last1=Duncan|first2=Michael T.|last2=Goodrich|author2-link=Michael T. Goodrich|first3=Stephen|last3=Kobourov|title=[[International Symposium on Graph Drawing|Graph Drawing, 17th International Symposium, GD 2009, Chicago, IL, USA, September 22-25, 2009, Revised Papers]]|series=Lecture Notes in Computer Science|publisher=Springer-Verlag|year=2010|pages=45–56|doi=10.1007/978-3-642-11805-0_7|volume=5849|chapter=Planar Drawings of Higher-Genus Graphs|isbn=978-3-642-11804-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

An embedded graph also defines natural cyclic orders of edges which constitutes the boundaries of the faces of the embedding. However handling these face-based orders is less straightforward, since in some cases some edges may be traversed twice along a face boundary. For example this is always the case for embeddings of trees, which have a single face. To overcome this combinatorial nuisance, one may consider that every edge is "split" lengthwise in two "half-edges", or "sides". Under this convention in all face boundary traversals each half-edge is traversed only once and the two half-edges of the same edge are always traversed in opposite directions.

Other equivalent representations for cellular embeddings include the [[ribbon graph]], a topological space formed by gluing together topological disks for the vertices and edges of an embedded graph, and the [[graph-encoded map]], an edge-colored [[cubic graph]] with four vertices for each edge of the embedded graph.

==Computational complexity==

The problem of finding the graph genus is [[NP-hard]] (the problem of determining whether an &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;-vertex graph has genus &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; is [[NP-complete]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last1=Thomassen | first1=Carsten | authorlink = Carsten Thomassen | title=The graph genus problem is NP-complete | year=1989 | journal=Journal of Algorithms | volume=10 | issue = 4 | pages=568–576 | doi = 10.1016/0196-6774(89)90006-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the same time, the graph genus problem is [[Fixed-parameter tractability|fixed-parameter tractable]], i.e.,  [[polynomial time]] algorithms are known to check whether a graph can be embedded into a surface of a given fixed genus as well as to find the embedding.

The first breakthrough in this respect happened in 1979, when algorithms of [[time complexity]]
''O''(''n''&lt;sup&gt;''O''(''g'')&lt;/sup&gt;) were independently submitted to the Annual [[ACM Symposium on Theory of Computing]]: one by I. Filotti and [[Gary Miller (computer scientist)|G.L. Miller]] and another one by [[John Reif]]. Their approaches were quite different, but upon the suggestion of the program committee they presented a joint paper.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first1=I. S.|last1=Filotti|author2-link=Gary Miller (computer scientist)|first2=Gary L.|last2=Miller|first3=John|last3=Reif|author3-link=John Reif |title=[[Symposium on Theory of Computing|Proc. 11th Annu. ACM Symposium on Theory of Computing]]|year=1979|pages=27–37|doi=10.1145/800135.804395|chapter=On determining the genus of a graph in O(v O(g)) steps(Preliminary Report)}}.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Myrvold and Kocay proved in 2011 that the algorithm given by Filotti, Miller and Reif was incorrect&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Myrvold|first1=Wendy|last2=Kocay|first2=William|title=Errors in Graph Embedding Algorithms|journal=Journal of Computer and System Sciences|date=March 1, 2011|volume=2|issue=77|page=430-438|doi=10.1016/j.jcss.2010.06.002|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022000010000863}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

In 1999 it was reported  that the fixed-genus case can be solved in time [[linear time|linear]] in the graph size and [[Double exponential function|doubly exponential]] in the genus.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last1=Mohar | first1=Bojan | authorlink = Bojan Mohar | title=A linear time algorithm for embedding graphs in an arbitrary surface | year=1999 | journal=[[SIAM Journal on Discrete Mathematics]] | volume=12 | issue=1 | pages=6–26 | doi = 10.1137/S089548019529248X| citeseerx=10.1.1.97.9588 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Embeddings of graphs into higher-dimensional spaces==
It is known that any finite graph can be embedded into a three-dimensional space.&lt;ref name="3d-gd"/&gt;

One method for doing this is to place the points on any line in space and to draw the edges as curves each of which lies in a distinct [[halfplane]], with all halfplanes having that line as their common boundary. An embedding like this in which the edges are drawn on halfplanes is called a [[book embedding]] of the graph. This [[metaphor]] comes from imagining that each of the  planes where an edge is drawn is like a page of a book. It was observed that in fact several edges may be drawn in the same "page"; the ''book thickness'' of the graph is the minimum number of halfplanes needed for such a drawing.

Alternatively, any finite graph can be drawn with straight-line edges in three dimensions without crossings by placing its vertices in [[general position]] so that no four are coplanar. For instance, this may be achieved by placing the ''i''th vertex at the point (''i'',''i''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;,''i''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) of the [[moment curve]].

An embedding of a graph into three-dimensional space in which no two of the cycles are topologically linked is called a [[linkless embedding]]. A graph has a linkless embedding if and only if it does not have one of the seven graphs of the [[Petersen family]] as a [[minor (graph theory)|minor]].

'''Heinz Hopf''' (19 November 1894 – 3 June 1971) was a [[Germans|German]] [[mathematician]] who worked on the fields of [[topology]] and [[geometry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor=I.M. James|title=History of Topology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7iRijkz0rrUC&amp;pg=PA991|date=24 August 1999|publisher=Elsevier|isbn=978-0-08-053407-7|page=991}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==
Hopf was born in [[Gräbschen]], [[Germany]] (now {{ill|Grabiszyn|pl|Grabiszyn-Grabiszynek}}, part of [[Wrocław]], [[Poland]]), the son of Elizabeth (née Kirchner) and Wilhelm Hopf. His father was born Jewish and converted to Protestantism a year after Heinz was born; his mother was from a Protestant family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/Printonly/Hopf.html |title= Heinz Hopf| publisher= University of St Andrews}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.robertnowlan.com/pdfs/Hopf,%20Heinz.pdf | title= Hopf, Heinz| website=RobertNowlan.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hopf attended Dr. [[Karl Mittelhaus]]' higher boys' school from 1901 to 1904, and then entered the König-Wilhelm-[[Gymnasium (school)|Gymnasium]] in Breslau. He showed mathematical talent from an early age. In 1913 he entered the [[Silesian Friedrich Wilhelm University]] where he attended lectures by [[Ernst Steinitz]], [[Adolf Kneser]], [[Max Dehn]], [[Erhard Schmidt]], and [[Rudolf Sturm]]. When [[World War I]] broke out in 1914, Hopf eagerly enlisted. He was wounded twice and received the iron cross (first class) in 1918.

After the war Hopf continued his mathematical education in [[Heidelberg]] (winter 1919/20 and summer 1920)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://histmath-heidelberg.de/homo-heid/hopf.htm |title=Heinz Hopf|publisher=Historia Mathematica Heidelbergensis}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Berlin]] (since winter 1920/21). He studied under [[Ludwig Bieberbach]] and receiving his doctorate in 1925.

==Career==
In his dissertation, ''Connections between topology and metric of manifolds'' (German ''Über Zusammenhänge zwischen Topologie und Metrik von Mannigfaltigkeiten''), he proved that any simply connected complete [[Riemannian manifold|Riemannian]] [[3-manifold]] of constant sectional [[curvature]] is globally [[Isometry|isometric]] to [[Euclidean space|Euclidean]], [[Elliptic geometry|spherical]], or [[hyperbolic space]]. He also studied the indices of zeros of [[vector field]]s on [[hypersurface]]s, and connected their sum to curvature. Some six months later he gave a new proof that the sum of the indices of the zeros of a vector field on a [[manifold]] is independent of the choice of vector field and equal to the [[Euler characteristic]] of the manifold. This theorem is now called the [[Poincaré–Hopf theorem]].

Hopf spent the year after his doctorate at the [[University of Göttingen]], where [[David Hilbert]], [[Richard Courant]], [[Carl Runge]], and [[Emmy Noether]] were working. While there he met [[Paul Alexandrov]] and began a lifelong friendship.

In 1926 Hopf moved back to [[Berlin]], where he gave a course in [[combinatorial topology]]. He spent the academic year 1927/28 at [[Princeton University]] on a Rockefeller fellowship with Alexandrov. [[Solomon Lefschetz]], [[Oswald Veblen]] and [[James Waddell Alexander II|J. W. Alexander]] were all at Princeton at the time. At this time Hopf discovered the [[Hopf invariant]] of maps &lt;math&gt;S^3 \to S^2&lt;/math&gt; and proved that the [[Hopf fibration]] has invariant 1. In the summer of 1928 Hopf returned to Berlin and began working with Alexandrov, at the suggestion of Courant, on a book on [[topology]]. Three volumes were planned, but only one was finished. It was published in 1935.

In 1929, he declined a job offer from [[Princeton University]]. In 1931 Hopf took [[Hermann Weyl]]'s position at [[ETH Zurich|ETH]], in [[Zürich]]. Hopf received another invitation to Princeton in 1940, but he declined it. Two years later, however, he was forced to file for Swiss citizenship after his property was confiscated by [[Nazi Germany|Nazi]]s, his father's conversion to Christianity having failed to convince German authorities that he was an "[[Aryan]]."

In 1946/47 and 1955/56 Hopf visited the United States, staying at Princeton and giving lectures at [[New York University]] and [[Stanford University]]. He served as president of the [[International Mathematical Union]] from 1955 to 1958.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mathunion.org/organization/ec/ec-1952-2014/|title=International Mathematical Union (IMU): IMU Executive Committees 1952-2014|last=|first=|date=|website=www.mathunion.org|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150108154651/http://www.mathunion.org/organization/ec/ec-1952-2014|archive-date=2015-01-08|dead-url=yes|access-date=2017-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
In October 1928 Hopf married Anja von Mickwitz (1891–1967).

==Honors and awards==
He received honorary doctorates from [[Princeton University]], the [[University of Freiburg]], the [[University of Manchester]], the [[University of Paris]], the [[Free University of Brussels]], and the [[University of Lausanne]]. In 1949 he was elected a corresponding member of the [[Heidelberg Academy of Sciences]]. He was an Invited Speaker at the [[International Congress of Mathematicians]] (ICM) in [[Zürich]] in 1932 and a Plenary Speaker at the ICM in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]] in 1950.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Hopf, H.|chapter=Die ''n''-dimensionalen Sphären und projektiven Räume in der Topologie|title=''In:'' Proceedings of the International Congress of Mathematicians, Cambridge, Massachusetts, U.S.A., August 30–September 6, 1950|volume=vol. 1|pages=193–202|year=1950|chapter-url=http://www.mathunion.org/ICM/ICM1950.1/Main/icm1950.1.0193.0202.ocr.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In memory of Hopf, [[ETH Zürich]] awards the [[Heinz Hopf Prize]] for outstanding scientific work in the field of [[pure mathematics]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="42513">In [[mathematics]], a '''Heyting algebra''' is a [[Lattice (order)#Bounded lattice|bounded lattice]] (with join and meet operations written ∨ and ∧ and with least element 0 and greatest element 1) equipped with a binary operation ''a'' → ''b'' of ''implication'' such that ''c'' ∧ ''a'' ≤ ''b'' is equivalent to ''c'' ≤ ''a'' → ''b''. From a logical standpoint, ''A'' → ''B'' is by this definition the weakest proposition for which [[modus ponens]], the inference rule ''A'' → ''B'', ''A'' ⊢ ''B'', is sound.  Equivalently a Heyting algebra is a [[residuated lattice]] whose monoid operation is ∧; yet another definition is as a [[posetal category|posetal]] [[cartesian closed category]] with all finite sums.  Like [[Boolean algebra]]s, Heyting algebras form a [[Variety (universal algebra)|variety]] axiomatizable with finitely many equations. Heyting algebras were introduced by {{harvs|txt|authorlink= Arend Heyting|first=Arend|last= Heyting|year=1930}} to formalize [[intuitionistic logic]].

As lattices, Heyting algebras are [[distributive lattice|distributive]].  Every [[Boolean algebra]] is a Heyting algebra when ''a'' → ''b'' is defined as usual as ¬''a'' ∨ ''b'', as is every [[Completeness (order theory)|complete]] [[distributive lattice]] satisfying a one-sided [[Distributivity (order theory)#Distributivity laws for complete lattices|infinite distributive law]] when ''a'' → ''b'' is taken to be the [[supremum]] of the set of all ''c'' for which ''a'' ∧ ''c'' ≤ ''b''.  The [[open set]]s of a [[topological space]] form such a lattice, and therefore a (complete) Heyting algebra.  In the finite case every nonempty distributive lattice, in particular every nonempty finite [[Total order#Chains|chain]], is automatically complete and completely distributive, and hence a Heyting algebra.

It follows from the definition that 1 ≤ 0 → ''a'', corresponding to the intuition that any proposition ''a'' is implied by a contradiction 0.  Although the negation operation ¬''a'' is not part of the definition, it is definable as ''a'' → 0.  The definition implies that ''a'' ∧ ¬''a'' = 0, making the intuitive content of ¬''a'' the proposition that to assume ''a'' would lead to a contradiction, from which any other proposition would then follow.  It can further be shown that ''a'' ≤ ¬¬''a'', although the converse, ¬¬''a'' ≤ ''a'', is not true in general, that is, [[double negation elimination]] does not hold in general in a Heyting algebra.

Heyting algebras generalize Boolean algebras in the sense that a Heyting algebra satisfying ''a'' ∨ ¬''a'' = 1 ([[excluded middle]]), equivalently ¬¬''a'' = ''a'' ([[double negation elimination]]), is a Boolean algebra. Those elements of a Heyting algebra of the form ¬''a'' comprise a Boolean lattice, but in general this is not a [[subalgebra]] of H (see [[Heyting algebra#Regular and complemented elements|below]]).

Heyting algebras serve as the algebraic models of propositional [[intuitionistic logic]] in the same way [[Boolean algebra]]s model propositional [[classical logic]].  [[Complete Heyting algebra]]s are a central object of study in [[pointless topology]].  The internal logic of an [[elementary topos]] is based on the Heyting algebra of [[subobject]]s of the [[terminal object]] 1 ordered by inclusion, equivalently the morphisms from 1 to the [[subobject classifier]] Ω.

Every Heyting algebra whose set of non-greatest elements has a greatest element (and forms another Heyting algebra) is [[Subdirectly irreducible algebra|subdirectly irreducible]], whence every Heyting algebra can be made an [[Subdirectly irreducible algebra|SI]] by adjoining a new greatest element.  It follows that even among the finite Heyting algebras there exist infinitely many that are subdirectly irreducible, no two of which have the same equational theory.  Hence no finite set of finite Heyting algebras can supply all the counterexamples to non-laws of Heyting algebra.  This is in sharp contrast to Boolean algebras, whose only SI is the two-element one, which on its own therefore suffices for all counterexamples to non-laws of Boolean algebra, the basis for the simple [[truth table]] decision method.  Nevertheless, it is decidable whether an equation holds of all Heyting algebras.&lt;ref name="Kripke63"&gt;Kripke, S. A.: 1965, ‘Semantical analysis of intuitionistic logic I’. In: J. N. Crossley and M. A. E. Dummett (eds.): Formal Systems and Recursive Functions. Amsterdam: North-Holland, pp. 92–130.&lt;/ref&gt;

Heyting algebras are less often called '''pseudo-Boolean algebras''',&lt;ref name="Rasiowa-Sikorski"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Helena Rasiowa|author2=Roman Sikorski|title=The Mathematics of Metamathematics|url=  |year=1963 |publisher=Państwowe Wydawnictwo Naukowe (PWN)|isbn= |pages=54–62, 93–95, 123–130}}&lt;/ref&gt; or even '''Brouwer lattices''',&lt;ref name="KusraevKutateladze1999"&gt;{{cite book|author1=A.

== Formal definition ==
A Heyting algebra ''H'' is a [[lattice (order)#Lattices as posets|bounded lattice]] such that for all ''a'' and ''b'' in ''H'' there is a greatest element ''x'' of ''H'' such that

:&lt;math&gt; a \wedge x \le b.&lt;/math&gt;

This element is the '''relative pseudo-complement''' of ''a'' with respect to ''b'', and is denoted ''a''→''b''. We write 1 and 0 for the largest and the smallest element of ''H'', respectively.

In any Heyting algebra, one defines the '''[[pseudo-complement]]''' ¬''a'' of any element ''a'' by setting  ¬''a'' = (''a''→0). By definition, &lt;math&gt;a\wedge \lnot a = 0&lt;/math&gt;, and ¬''a'' is the largest element having this property. However, it is not in general true that &lt;math&gt;a\vee\lnot a=1&lt;/math&gt;, thus ¬ is only a pseudo-complement, not a true [[complement (set theory)|complement]], as would be the case in a Boolean algebra.

A '''[[complete Heyting algebra]]''' is a Heyting algebra that is a [[complete lattice]].

A '''subalgebra''' of a Heyting algebra ''H'' is a subset ''H''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; of ''H'' containing 0 and 1 and closed under the operations ∧, ∨ and →. It follows that it is also closed under ¬. A subalgebra is made into a Heyting algebra by the induced operations.

==Alternative definitions==
===Category-theoretic definition===
A Heyting algebra &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; is a bounded lattice that has all [[exponential object]]s.

The lattice &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; is regarded as a [[category (mathematics)|category]] where 
meet, &lt;math&gt;\wedge&lt;/math&gt;, is the [[product (category theory)|product]]. The exponential condition means that for any objects &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Z&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; an exponential &lt;math&gt;Z^Y&lt;/math&gt; uniquely exists as an object in &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt;.

A Heyting implication (often written using &lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\multimap&lt;/math&gt; to avoid confusions such as the use of &lt;math&gt;\to&lt;/math&gt; to indicate a [[functor]]) is just an exponential: &lt;math&gt;Y \Rightarrow Z&lt;/math&gt; is an alternative notation for &lt;math&gt;Z^Y&lt;/math&gt;. From the definition of exponentials we have that implication (&lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow : H \times H \to H&lt;/math&gt;) is [[right adjoint]] to meet (&lt;math&gt;\wedge : H \times H \to H&lt;/math&gt;). This adjunction can be written as &lt;math&gt;(- \wedge Y) \dashv (Y \Rightarrow -)&lt;/math&gt; or more fully as:
&lt;math display="block"&gt;(- \wedge Y): H \stackrel {\longrightarrow} {\underset {\longleftarrow}{\top}} H: (Y \Rightarrow -)&lt;/math&gt;

===Lattice-theoretic definitions===
An equivalent definition of Heyting algebras can be given by considering the mappings:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{cases} f_a \colon H \to H \\ f_a(x)=a\wedge x \end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

for some fixed ''a'' in ''H''. A bounded lattice ''H'' is a Heyting algebra [[if and only if]] every mapping ''f&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the lower adjoint of a monotone [[Galois connection]]. In this case the respective upper adjoint ''g&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;'' is given by ''g&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;''(''x'') = ''a''→''x'', where → is defined as above.

Yet another definition is as a [[residuated lattice]] whose monoid operation is ∧. The monoid unit must then be the top element 1. Commutativity of this monoid implies that the two residuals coincide as ''a''→''b''.

===Bounded lattice with an implication operation===
Given a bounded lattice ''A'' with largest and smallest elements 1 and 0, and a binary operation →, these together form a Heyting algebra if and only if the following hold:
#&lt;math&gt;a\to a = 1&lt;/math&gt;
#&lt;math&gt;a\wedge(a\to b)=a\wedge b&lt;/math&gt;
#&lt;math&gt;b\wedge(a\to b)= b&lt;/math&gt;
#&lt;math&gt;a\to (b\wedge c)= (a\to b)\wedge (a\to c)&lt;/math&gt;
where 4 is the distributive law for →.

===Characterization using the axioms of intuitionistic logic===
This characterization of Heyting algebras makes the proof of the basic facts concerning the relationship between intuitionist propositional calculus and Heyting algebras immediate. (For these facts, see the sections "[[#Provable identities|Provable identities]]" and "[[#Universal constructions|Universal constructions]]".) One should think of the element &lt;math&gt;\top&lt;/math&gt; as meaning, intuitively, "provably true." Compare with the axioms at [[Intuitionistic logic#Axiomatization]] ).

Given a set ''A'' with three binary operations →, ∧ and ∨, and two distinguished elements &lt;math&gt;\bot&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\top&lt;/math&gt;, then ''A'' is a Heyting algebra for these operations (and the relation ≤ defined by the condition that &lt;math&gt;a \le b&lt;/math&gt; when ''a''→''b'' = &lt;math&gt;\top&lt;/math&gt;) if and only if the following conditions hold for any elements ''x'', ''y'' and ''z'' of ''A'':

#&lt;math&gt;\mbox{If } x \le y  \mbox{ and } y \le x  \mbox{ then } x = y ,&lt;/math&gt;
#&lt;math&gt;\mbox{If } \top \le y , \mbox{ then } y = \top ,&lt;/math&gt;
#&lt;math&gt;x \le y \to x  ,&lt;/math&gt;
#&lt;math&gt; x \to (y \to z) \le (x \to y) \to (x \to z)  ,&lt;/math&gt;
#&lt;math&gt; x \land y \le x  ,&lt;/math&gt;
#&lt;math&gt; x \land y \le y ,&lt;/math&gt;
#&lt;math&gt; x \le y \to (x \land y)  ,&lt;/math&gt;
#&lt;math&gt; x \le x \lor y ,&lt;/math&gt;
#&lt;math&gt; y \le x \lor y  ,&lt;/math&gt;
#&lt;math&gt; x \to z \le (y \to z) \to (x \lor y \to z)  ,&lt;/math&gt;
#&lt;math&gt; \bot \le x  .&lt;/math&gt;
Finally, we define ¬''x'' to be ''x''→ &lt;math&gt;\bot&lt;/math&gt;.

Condition 1 says that equivalent formulas should be identified. Condition&amp;nbsp;2 says that provably true formulas are closed under [[modus ponens]]. Conditions&amp;nbsp;3 and 4 are ''then'' conditions. Conditions&amp;nbsp;5, 6 and 7 are ''and'' conditions. Conditions&amp;nbsp;8, 9 and 10 are ''or'' conditions. Condition&amp;nbsp;11 is a ''false'' condition.

Of course, if a different set of axioms were chosen for logic, we could modify ours accordingly.

&lt;li&gt; Every [[total order|totally ordered set]] that is a bounded lattice is also a Heyting algebra, where ''p''→''q'' is equal to ''q'' when ''p''&gt;''q'', and 1 otherwise.
&lt;li&gt; The simplest Heyting algebra that is not already a Boolean algebra is the totally ordered set {0, ½, 1} with → defined as above, yielding the operations:

In this example, that {{math|size=100%|1= ½&amp;or;¬½ = ½&amp;or;(½ &amp;rarr; 0) = ½&amp;or;0 = ½}} falsifies the law of excluded middle.

&lt;li&gt; Every [[topology]] provides a complete Heyting algebra in the form of its [[open set]] lattice. In this case, the element ''A''→''B'' is the [[interior (topology)|interior]] of the union of ''A&lt;sup&gt;c&lt;/sup&gt;'' and ''B'', where ''A&lt;sup&gt;c&lt;/sup&gt;'' denotes the [[Complement (set theory)|complement]] of the [[open set]] ''A''. Not all complete Heyting algebras are of this form. These issues are studied in [[pointless topology]], where complete Heyting algebras are also called '''frames''' or '''locales'''.
&lt;li&gt; Every [[interior algebra]] provides a Heyting algebra in the form of its lattice of open elements. Every Heyting algebra is of this form as a Heyting algebra can be completed to a Boolean algebra by taking its free Boolean extension as a bounded distributive lattice and then treating it as a [[generalized topology]] in this Boolean algebra.
&lt;li&gt; The [[Lindenbaum algebra]] of propositional [[intuitionistic logic]] is a Heyting algebra.
&lt;li&gt; The [[global element]]s of the [[subobject classifier]] Ω of an [[elementary topos]] form a Heyting algebra; it is the Heyting algebra of [[truth value]]s of the intuitionistic higher-order logic induced by the topos.
&lt;li&gt; [[Łukasiewicz–Moisil algebra]]s (LM&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) are also Heyting algebras for any ''n''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1007/s10516-005-4145-6| title = N-Valued Logics and Łukasiewicz–Moisil Algebras| journal = Axiomathes| volume = 16| pages = 123| year = 2006| last1 = Georgescu | first1 = G. }}, Theorem 3.6&lt;/ref&gt; (but they are not [[MV-algebras]] for ''n'' ≥ 5&lt;ref&gt;Iorgulescu, A.: Connections between MV&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;-algebras and ''n''-valued Łukasiewicz–Moisil algebras—I. Discrete Math. 181, 155–177 (1998) {{doi|10.1016/S0012-365X(97)00052-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;).
&lt;/ul&gt;

== Properties ==

===General properties===
The ordering &lt;math&gt;\le&lt;/math&gt; on a Heyting algebra ''H'' can be recovered from the operation → as follows: for any elements ''a'', ''b'' of ''H'', &lt;math&gt;a \le b&lt;/math&gt; if and only if ''a''→''b'' = 1.

In contrast to some [[many-valued logic]]s, Heyting algebras share the following property with Boolean algebras: if negation has a [[fixed point (mathematics)|fixed point]] (i.e. ¬''a'' = ''a'' for some ''a''), then the Heyting algebra is the trivial one-element Heyting algebra.

===Provable identities===
Given a formula &lt;math&gt;F(A_1, A_2,\ldots, A_n)&lt;/math&gt; of propositional calculus (using, in addition to the variables, the connectives &lt;math&gt;\land, \lor, \lnot, \to&lt;/math&gt;, and the constants 0 and 1), it is a fact, proved early on in any study of Heyting algebras, that the following two conditions are equivalent:
# The formula ''F'' is provably true in intuitionist propositional calculus.
# The identity &lt;math&gt;F(a_1, a_2,\ldots, a_n) = 1&lt;/math&gt; is true for any Heyting algebra ''H'' and any elements &lt;math&gt;a_1, a_2,\ldots, a_n \in H&lt;/math&gt;.
The metaimplication {{nowrap|1 ⇒ 2}} is extremely useful and is the principal practical method for proving identities in Heyting algebras. In practice, one frequently uses the [[deduction theorem]] in such proofs.

Since for any ''a'' and ''b'' in a Heyting algebra ''H'' we have &lt;math&gt;a \le b&lt;/math&gt; if and only if ''a''→''b'' = 1, it follows from {{nowrap|1 ⇒ 2}} that whenever a formula ''F''→''G'' is provably true, we have &lt;math&gt;F(a_1, a_2,\ldots, a_n) \le G(a_1, a_2,\ldots, a_n)&lt;/math&gt; for any Heyting algebra ''H'', and any elements &lt;math&gt;a_1, a_2,\ldots, a_n \in H&lt;/math&gt;. (It follows from the deduction theorem that ''F''→''G'' is provable [from nothing] if and only if ''G'' is provable from ''F'', that is, if ''G'' is a provable consequence of ''F''.) In particular, if ''F'' and ''G'' are provably equivalent, then &lt;math&gt;F(a_1, a_2,\ldots, a_n) = G(a_1, a_2,\ldots, a_n)&lt;/math&gt;, since ≤ is an order relation.

1 ⇒ 2 can be proved by examining the logical axioms of the system of proof and verifying that their value is 1 in any Heyting algebra, and then verifying that the application of the rules of inference to expressions with value 1 in a Heyting algebra results in expressions with value 1. For example, let us choose the system of proof having [[modus ponens]] as its sole rule of inference, and whose axioms are the Hilbert-style ones given at [[Intuitionistic logic#Axiomatization]]. Then the facts to be verified follow immediately from the axiom-like definition of Heyting algebras given above.

1 ⇒ 2 also provides a method for proving that certain propositional formulas, though [[tautology (logic)|tautologies]] in classical logic, ''cannot'' be proved in intuitionist propositional logic. In order to prove that some formula &lt;math&gt;F(A_1, A_2,\ldots, A_n)&lt;/math&gt; is not provable, it is enough to exhibit a Heyting algebra ''H'' and elements &lt;math&gt;a_1, a_2,\ldots, a_n \in H&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;F(a_1, a_2,\ldots, a_n) \ne 1&lt;/math&gt;.

If one wishes to avoid mention of logic, then in practice it becomes necessary to prove as a lemma a version of the deduction theorem valid for Heyting algebras: for any elements ''a'', ''b'' and ''c'' of a Heyting algebra ''H'', we have &lt;math&gt;(a \land b) \to c = a \to (b \to c)&lt;/math&gt;.

For more on the metaimplication 2 ⇒ 1, see the section "[[#Universal constructions|Universal constructions]]" below.

===Distributivity===
Heyting algebras are always [[distributivity (order theory)|distributive]]. Specifically, we always have the identities
#&lt;math&gt;a \wedge (b \vee c) = (a \wedge b) \vee (a \wedge c)&lt;/math&gt;
#&lt;math&gt;a \vee (b \wedge c) = (a \vee b) \wedge (a \vee c)&lt;/math&gt;

The distributive law is sometimes stated as an axiom, but in fact it follows from the existence of relative pseudo-complements. The reason is that, being the lower adjoint of a [[Galois connection]], &lt;math&gt;\wedge&lt;/math&gt; [[limit-preserving function (order theory)|preserves]] all existing [[suprema]]. Distributivity in turn is just the preservation of binary suprema by &lt;math&gt;\wedge&lt;/math&gt;.

By a similar argument, the following [[infinite distributive law]] holds in any complete Heyting algebra:

:&lt;math&gt;x\wedge\bigvee Y = \bigvee \{x\wedge y \mid y \in Y\}&lt;/math&gt;

for any element ''x'' in ''H'' and any subset ''Y'' of ''H''. Conversely, any complete lattice satisfying the above infinite distributive law is a complete Heyting algebra, with
:&lt;math&gt;a\to b=\bigvee\{c\mid a\land c\le b\}&lt;/math&gt;
being its relative pseudo-complement operation.

===Regular and complemented elements===
An element ''x'' of a Heyting algebra ''H'' is called '''regular''' if either of the following equivalent conditions hold:
#''x'' =  ¬¬''x''.
#''x'' =  ¬''y'' for some ''y'' in ''H''.
The equivalence of these conditions can be restated simply as the identity ¬¬¬''x'' = ¬''x'', valid for all ''x'' in ''H''.

Elements ''x'' and ''y'' of a Heyting algebra ''H'' are called '''complements''' to each other if ''x''∧''y'' = 0 and ''x''∨''y'' = 1. If it exists, any such ''y'' is unique and must in fact be equal to ¬''x''. We call an element ''x'' '''complemented''' if it admits a complement. It is true that ''if'' ''x'' is complemented, then so is ¬''x'', and then ''x'' and ¬''x'' are complements to each other. However, confusingly, even if ''x'' is not complemented, ¬''x'' may nonetheless have a complement (not equal to ''x''). In any Heyting algebra, the elements 0 and 1 are complements to each other. For instance, it is possible that ¬''x'' is 0 for every ''x'' different from 0, and 1 if ''x'' = 0, in which case 0 and 1 are the only regular elements.

Any complemented element of a Heyting algebra is regular, though the converse is not true in general. In particular, 0 and 1 are always regular.

For any Heyting algebra ''H'', the following conditions are equivalent:
# ''H'' is a [[Boolean algebra (structure)|Boolean algebra]];
# every ''x'' in ''H'' is regular;&lt;ref&gt;Rutherford (1965), Th.26.2 p.78.&lt;/ref&gt;
# every ''x'' in ''H'' is complemented.&lt;ref&gt;Rutherford (1965), Th.26.1 p.78.&lt;/ref&gt;
In this case, the element {{nowrap|1=''a''→''b''}} is equal to {{nowrap|1=¬''a'' ∨ ''b''.}}

The regular (resp. complemented) elements of any Heyting algebra ''H'' constitute a Boolean algebra ''H''&lt;sub&gt;reg&lt;/sub&gt; (resp. ''H''&lt;sub&gt;comp&lt;/sub&gt;), in which the operations ∧, ¬ and →, as well as the constants 0 and 1, coincide with those of ''H''. In the case of ''H''&lt;sub&gt;comp&lt;/sub&gt;, the operation ∨ is also the same, hence ''H''&lt;sub&gt;comp&lt;/sub&gt; is a subalgebra of ''H''. In general however, ''H''&lt;sub&gt;reg&lt;/sub&gt; will not be a subalgebra of ''H'', because its join operation ∨&lt;sub&gt;reg&lt;/sub&gt; may be differ from ∨. For {{nowrap|1=''x'', ''y'' ∈ ''H''&lt;sub&gt;reg&lt;/sub&gt;,}} we have {{nowrap|1=''x'' ∨&lt;sub&gt;reg&lt;/sub&gt; ''y'' = ¬(¬''x'' ∧ ¬''y'').}} See below for necessary and sufficient conditions in order for ∨&lt;sub&gt;reg&lt;/sub&gt; to coincide with ∨.

===The De Morgan laws in a Heyting algebra===
One of the two [[De Morgan laws]] is satisfied in every Heyting algebra, namely

:&lt;math&gt;\forall x,y \in H: \qquad \lnot(x \vee y)=\lnot x \wedge \lnot y.&lt;/math&gt;

However, the other De Morgan law does not always hold. We have instead a weak de Morgan law:

:&lt;math&gt;\forall x,y \in H: \qquad \lnot(x \wedge y)= \lnot \lnot (\lnot x \vee \lnot y).&lt;/math&gt;

The following statements are equivalent for all Heyting algebras ''H'':
#''H'' satisfies both De Morgan laws,
#&lt;math&gt;\lnot(x \wedge y)=\lnot x \vee \lnot y \mbox{ for all } x, y \in H,&lt;/math&gt;
#&lt;math&gt;\lnot(x \wedge y)=\lnot x \vee \lnot y \mbox{ for all regular } x, y \in H,&lt;/math&gt;
#&lt;math&gt;\lnot\lnot (x \vee y) = \lnot\lnot x \vee \lnot\lnot y \mbox{ for all } x, y \in H,&lt;/math&gt;
#&lt;math&gt;\lnot\lnot (x \vee y) = x \vee y \mbox{ for all regular } x, y \in H,&lt;/math&gt;
#&lt;math&gt;\lnot(\lnot x \wedge \lnot y) = x \vee y \mbox{ for all regular } x, y \in H,&lt;/math&gt;
#&lt;math&gt;\lnot x \vee \lnot\lnot x = 1 \mbox{ for all } x \in H.&lt;/math&gt;
Condition 2 is the other De Morgan law. Condition 6 says that the join operation ∨&lt;sub&gt;reg&lt;/sub&gt; on the Boolean algebra ''H''&lt;sub&gt;reg&lt;/sub&gt; of regular elements of ''H'' coincides with the operation ∨ of ''H''. Condition 7 states that every regular element is complemented, i.e., ''H''&lt;sub&gt;reg&lt;/sub&gt; = ''H''&lt;sub&gt;comp&lt;/sub&gt;.

We prove the equivalence. Clearly the metaimplications {{nowrap|1 ⇒ 2,}} {{nowrap|2 ⇒ 3}} and {{nowrap|4 ⇒ 5}} are trivial. Furthermore, {{nowrap|3 ⇔ 4}} and {{nowrap|5 ⇔ 6}} result simply from the first De Morgan law and the definition of regular elements. We show that {{nowrap|6 ⇒ 7}} by taking ¬''x'' and ¬¬''x'' in place of ''x'' and ''y'' in 6 and using the identity {{nowrap|''a'' &amp;and; ¬''a'' {{=}} 0.}} Notice that {{nowrap|2 ⇒ 1}} follows from the first De Morgan law, and {{nowrap|7 ⇒ 6}} results from the fact that the join operation  ∨ on the subalgebra ''H''&lt;sub&gt;comp&lt;/sub&gt; is just the restriction of ∨ to ''H''&lt;sub&gt;comp&lt;/sub&gt;, taking into account the characterizations we have given of conditions 6 and 7. The metaimplication {{nowrap|5 ⇒ 2}} is a trivial consequence of the weak De Morgan law, taking ¬''x'' and ¬''y'' in place of ''x'' and ''y'' in 5.

Heyting algebras satisfying the above properties are related to [[Intermediate logic|De Morgan logic]] in the same way Heyting algebras in general are related to intuitionist logic.

==Heyting algebra morphisms==

===Definition===
Given two Heyting algebras ''H''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''H''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and a mapping {{nowrap|1=''f'' : ''H''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; → ''H''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,}} we say that ''ƒ'' is a '''[[morphism]]''' of Heyting algebras if, for any elements ''x'' and ''y'' in ''H''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, we have:
#&lt;math&gt;f(0) = 0,&lt;/math&gt;
#&lt;math&gt; f(x \land y) = f(x) \land f(y),&lt;/math&gt;
#&lt;math&gt; f(x \lor y) = f(x) \lor f(y),&lt;/math&gt;
#&lt;math&gt;f(x \to y) = f(x) \to f(y),&lt;/math&gt;

It follows from condition 4 (or 2 alone, or 3 alone) that ''f'' is an increasing function, that is, that {{nowrap|1=''f''(''x'') &amp;le; ''f''(''y'')}} whenever {{nowrap|1=''x'' &amp;le; ''y''}}.

Assume ''H''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''H''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are structures with operations →, ∧, ∨ (and possibly ¬) and constants 0 and 1, and ''f'' is a surjective mapping from ''H''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; to ''H''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; with properties 1 through 5 (or 1 through 6) above. Then if ''H''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is a Heyting algebra, so too is ''H''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. This follows from the characterization of Heyting algebras as bounded lattices (thought of as algebraic structures rather than partially ordered sets) with an operation → satisfying certain identities.

===Properties===
The identity map {{nowrap|1=''f''(''x'') = ''x''}} from any Heyting algebra to itself is a morphism, and the composite {{nowrap|1=''g'' ∘ ''f''}} of any two morphisms ''f'' and ''g'' is a morphism. Hence Heyting algebras form a [[Category (mathematics)|category]].

===Examples===
Given a Heyting algebra ''H'' and any subalgebra ''H''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, the inclusion mapping {{nowrap|1=''i'' : ''H''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; → ''H''}} is a morphism.

For any Heyting algebra ''H'', the map {{nowrap|1=''x'' ↦ ¬¬''x''}} defines a morphism from ''H'' onto the Boolean algebra of its regular elements ''H''&lt;sub&gt;reg&lt;/sub&gt;. This is ''not'' in general a morphism from ''H'' to itself, since the join operation of ''H''&lt;sub&gt;reg&lt;/sub&gt; may be different from that of ''H''.

==Quotients==
Let ''H'' be a Heyting algebra, and let {{nowrap|1=''F'' &amp;sube; ''H''.}} We call ''F'' a '''filter''' on ''H'' if it satisfies the following properties:
#&lt;math&gt;1 \in F,&lt;/math&gt;
#&lt;math&gt; \mbox{If } x,y \in F \mbox{ then } x \land y \in F,&lt;/math&gt;
#&lt;math&gt; \mbox{If } x \in F, \ y \in H, \ \mbox{and } x \le y \mbox{ then } y \in F.&lt;/math&gt;

The intersection of any set of filters on ''H'' is again a filter. Therefore, given any subset ''S'' of ''H'' there is a smallest filter containing ''S''. We call it the filter '''generated''' by ''S''. If ''S'' is empty, {{nowrap|1=''F'' = {1}.}} Otherwise, ''F'' is equal to the set of ''x'' in ''H'' such that there exist {{nowrap|1=''y''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''y''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, &amp;hellip;, ''y''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; ∈ ''S''}} with {{nowrap|1=''y''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ∧ ''y''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ∧ &amp;hellip; ∧ ''y''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;le; ''x''.}}

If ''H'' is a Heyting algebra and ''F'' is a filter on ''H'', we define a relation ∼ on ''H'' as follows: we write {{nowrap|1=''x'' &amp;sim; ''y''}} whenever {{nowrap|1=''x'' → ''y''}} and {{nowrap|1=''y'' → ''x''}} both belong to ''F''. Then ∼ is an [[equivalence relation]]; we write {{nowrap|1=''H''/''F''}} for the [[quotient set]]. There is a unique Heyting algebra structure on {{nowrap|1=''H''/''F''}} such that the canonical surjection {{nowrap|1=''p''&lt;sub&gt;''F''&lt;/sub&gt; : ''H'' → ''H''/''F''}} becomes a Heyting algebra morphism. We call the Heyting algebra {{nowrap|1=''H''/''F''}} the '''quotient''' of ''H'' by ''F''.

Let ''S'' be a subset of a Heyting algebra ''H'' and let ''F'' be the filter generated by ''S''. Then ''H''/''F'' satisfies the following universal property:
:Given any morphism of Heyting algebras {{nowrap|1=''f'' : ''H'' → ''H′''}} satisfying {{nowrap|1=''f''(''y'') = 1}} for every {{nowrap|1=''y'' ∈ ''S'',}} ''f'' factors uniquely through the canonical surjection {{nowrap|1=''p''&lt;sub&gt;''F''&lt;/sub&gt; : ''H'' → ''H''/''F''.}} That is, there is a unique morphism {{nowrap|1=''f′'' : ''H''/''F'' → ''H′''}} satisfying {{nowrap|1=''f′p''&lt;sub&gt;''F''&lt;/sub&gt; = ''f''.}} The morphism ''f′'' is said to be ''induced'' by ''f''.

Let {{nowrap|1=''f'' : ''H''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; → ''H''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}} be a morphism of Heyting algebras. The '''kernel''' of ''f'', written ker ''f'', is the set {{nowrap|1=''f''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;[{1}].}} It is a filter on ''H''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;. (Care should be taken because this definition, if applied to a morphism of Boolean algebras, is dual to what would be called the kernel of the morphism viewed as a morphism of rings.) By the foregoing, ''f'' induces a morphism {{nowrap|1=''f′'' : ''H''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;/(ker ''f'') → ''H''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.}} It is an isomorphism of {{nowrap|1=''H''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;/(ker ''f'')}} onto the subalgebra ''f''[''H''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;] of ''H''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

==Universal constructions==

===Heyting algebra of propositional formulas in ''n'' variables up to intuitionist equivalence===
The metaimplication {{nowrap|2 ⇒ 1}} in the section "[[#Provable identities|Provable identities]]" is proved by showing that the result of the following construction is itself a Heyting algebra:
#Consider the set ''L'' of propositional formulas in the variables ''A''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''A''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,..., ''A''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;.
# Endow ''L'' with a preorder ≼ by defining ''F''≼''G'' if ''G'' is an (intuitionist) [[logical consequence]] of ''F'', that is, if ''G'' is provable from ''F''. It is immediate that ≼ is a preorder.
# Consider the equivalence relation ''F''∼''G'' induced by the preorder F≼G. (It is defined by ''F''∼''G'' if and only if ''F''≼''G'' and ''G''≼''F''. In fact, ∼ is the relation of (intuitionist) logical equivalence.)
# Let ''H''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; be the quotient set ''L''/∼. This will be the desired Heyting algebra.
# We write [''F''] for the equivalence class of a formula ''F''. Operations →, ∧, ∨ and ¬ are defined in an obvious way on ''L''. Verify that given formulas ''F'' and ''G'', the equivalence classes [''F''→''G''], [''F''∧''G''], [''F''∨''G''] and [¬''F''] depend only on [''F''] and [''G'']. This defines operations →, ∧, ∨ and ¬ on the quotient set ''H''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;=''L''/∼. Further define 1 to be the class of provably true statements, and set 0=[⊥].
# Verify that ''H''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, together with these operations, is a Heyting algebra. We do this using the axiom-like definition of Heyting algebras. ''H''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; satisfies conditions THEN-1 through FALSE because all formulas of the given forms are axioms of intuitionist logic. MODUS-PONENS follows from the fact that if a formula ⊤→''F'' is provably true, where ⊤ is provably true, then ''F'' is provably true (by application of the rule of inference modus ponens). Finally, EQUIV results from the fact that if ''F''→''G'' and ''G''→''F'' are both provably true, then ''F'' and ''G'' are provable from each other (by application of the rule of inference modus ponens), hence [''F'']=[''G''].

As always under the axiom-like definition of Heyting algebras, we define ≤ on ''H''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; by the condition that ''x''≤''y'' if and only if ''x''→''y''=1. Since, by the [[deduction theorem]], a formula ''F''→''G'' is provably true if and only if ''G'' is provable from ''F'', it follows that [''F'']≤[''G''] if and only if  F≼G. In other words, ≤ is the order relation on ''L''/∼ induced by the preorder ≼ on ''L''.

===Free Heyting algebra on an arbitrary set of generators===
In fact, the preceding construction can be carried out for any set of variables {''A''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; : ''i''∈''I''} (possibly infinite). One obtains in this way the ''free'' Heyting algebra on the variables {''A''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}, which we will again denote by ''H''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;. It is free in the sense that given any Heyting algebra ''H'' given together with a family of its elements 〈''a''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;: ''i''∈''I'' 〉, there is a unique morphism ''f'':''H''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;→''H'' satisfying ''f''([''A''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;])=''a''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;. The uniqueness of ''f'' is not difficult to see, and its existence results essentially from the metaimplication {{nowrap|1 ⇒ 2}} of the section "[[#Provable identities|Provable identities]]" above, in the form of its corollary that whenever ''F'' and ''G'' are provably equivalent formulas, ''F''(〈''a''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;〉)=''G''(〈''a''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;〉) for any family of elements 〈''a''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;〉in ''H''.

===Heyting algebra of formulas equivalent with respect to a theory ''T''===
Given a set of formulas ''T'' in the variables {''A''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}, viewed as axioms, the same construction could have been carried out with respect to a relation ''F''≼''G'' defined on ''L'' to mean that ''G'' is a provable consequence of ''F'' and the set of axioms ''T''. Let us denote by ''H''&lt;sub&gt;''T''&lt;/sub&gt; the Heyting algebra so obtained. Then ''H''&lt;sub&gt;''T''&lt;/sub&gt; satisfies the same universal property as ''H''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; above, but with respect to Heyting algebras ''H'' and families of elements 〈''a''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;〉 satisfying the property that ''J''(〈''a''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;〉)=1 for any axiom ''J''(〈''A''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;〉) in ''T''. (Let us note that ''H''&lt;sub&gt;''T''&lt;/sub&gt;, taken with the family of its elements 〈[''A''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;]〉, itself satisfies this property.) The existence and uniqueness of the morphism is proved the same way as for ''H''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, except that one must modify the metaimplication {{nowrap|1 ⇒ 2}} in "[[#Provable identities|Provable identities]]" so that 1 reads "provably true ''from T''," and 2 reads "any elements ''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,..., ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; in ''H'' ''satisfying the formulas of T''."

The Heyting algebra ''H''&lt;sub&gt;''T''&lt;/sub&gt; that we have just defined can be viewed as a quotient of the free Heyting algebra ''H''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; on the same set of variables, by applying the universal property of ''H''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; with respect to ''H''&lt;sub&gt;''T''&lt;/sub&gt;, and the family of its elements 〈[''A''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;]〉.

Every Heyting algebra is isomorphic to one of the form ''H''&lt;sub&gt;''T''&lt;/sub&gt;. To see this, let ''H'' be any Heyting algebra, and let 〈''a''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;: ''i''∈I〉 be a family of elements generating ''H'' (for example, any surjective family). Now consider the set ''T'' of formulas ''J''(〈''A''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;〉) in the variables 〈''A''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;: ''i''∈I〉 such that ''J''(〈''a''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;〉)=1. Then we obtain a morphism ''f'':''H''&lt;sub&gt;''T''&lt;/sub&gt;→''H'' by the universal property of ''H''&lt;sub&gt;''T''&lt;/sub&gt;, which is clearly surjective. It is not difficult to show that ''f'' is injective.

===Comparison to Lindenbaum algebras===
The constructions we have just given play an entirely analogous role with respect to Heyting algebras to that of [[Lindenbaum algebra]]s with respect to [[Boolean algebra (structure)|Boolean algebras]]. In fact, The Lindenbaum algebra ''B''&lt;sub&gt;''T''&lt;/sub&gt; in the variables {''A''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;} with respect to the axioms ''T'' is just our ''H''&lt;sub&gt;''T''∪''T''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;, where ''T''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is the set of all formulas of the form ¬¬''F''→''F'', since the additional axioms of ''T''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; are the only ones that need to be added in order to make all classical tautologies provable.

==Heyting algebras as applied to intuitionistic logic==
If one interprets the axioms of the intuitionistic propositional logic as terms of a Heyting algebra, then they will evaluate to the largest element, 1, in ''any'' Heyting algebra under any assignment of values to the formula's variables. For instance, (''P''∧''Q'')→''P'' is, by definition of the pseudo-complement, the largest element ''x'' such that &lt;math&gt;P \land Q \land x \le P&lt;/math&gt;. This inequation is satisfied for any ''x'', so the largest such ''x'' is 1.

Furthermore, the rule of [[modus ponens]] allows us to derive the formula ''Q'' from the formulas ''P'' and ''P''→''Q''. But in any Heyting algebra, if ''P'' has the value 1, and ''P''→''Q'' has the value 1, then it means that &lt;math&gt;P \land 1 \le Q&lt;/math&gt;, and so &lt;math&gt;1 \land 1 \le Q&lt;/math&gt;; it can only be that ''Q'' has the value 1.

This means that if a formula is deducible from the laws of intuitionistic logic, being derived from its axioms by way of the rule of modus ponens, then it will always have the value 1 in all Heyting algebras under any assignment of values to the formula's variables. However one can construct a Heyting algebra in which the value of Peirce's law is not always 1. Consider the 3-element algebra {0,½,1} as given above. If we assign ½ to ''P'' and 0 to ''Q'', then the value of Peirce's law ((''P''→''Q'')→''P'')→''P'' is ½. It follows that Peirce's law cannot be intuitionistically derived. See [[Curry&amp;ndash;Howard isomorphism]] for the general context of what this implies in [[type theory]].

The converse can be proven as well: if a formula always has the value 1, then it is deducible from the laws of intuitionistic logic, so the ''intuitionistically valid'' formulas are exactly those that always have a value of 1. This is similar to the notion that ''classically valid'' formulas are those formulas that have a value of 1 in the [[two-element Boolean algebra]] under any possible assignment of true and false to the formula's variables &amp;mdash; that is, they are formulas which are tautologies in the usual truth-table sense. A Heyting algebra, from the logical standpoint, is then a generalization of the usual system of truth values, and its largest element 1 is analogous to 'true'. The usual two-valued logic system is a special case of a Heyting algebra, and the smallest non-trivial one, in which the only elements of the algebra are 1 (true) and 0 (false).

==Decision problems==
The problem of whether a given equation holds in every Heyting algebra was shown to be decidable by S. Kripke in 1965.&lt;ref name="Kripke63" /&gt; The precise [[Computational complexity theory|computational complexity]] of the problem was established by R. Statman in 1979, who showed it was [[PSPACE-complete]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Statman | first1 = R. | year = 1979 | title = Intuitionistic propositional logic is polynomial-space complete | url = | journal = Theoretical Comput. Sci. | volume = 9 | issue = | pages = 67–72 | doi=10.1016/0304-3975(79)90006-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; and hence at least as hard as [[Boolean satisfiability problem|deciding equations of Boolean algebra]] (shown coNP-complete in 1971 by S. Cook)&lt;ref name="Cook71"&gt;{{Cite news|last = Cook  | first = S.A. | authorlink = Stephen A. Cook  | title = The complexity of theorem proving procedures

The elementary or first-order theory of Heyting algebras is undecidable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Grzegorczyk | first1 = Andrzej | authorlink = Andrzej Grzegorczyk | year = 1951 | title = Undecidability of some topological theories | url = | journal = Fundamenta Mathematicae | volume = 38 | issue = | pages = 137–52 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It remains open whether the [[universal Horn theory]] of Heyting algebras, or [[word problem (mathematics)|word problem]], is decidable.&lt;ref&gt;Peter T. Johnstone, ''Stone Spaces'', (1982) Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, {{ISBN|0-521-23893-5}}. ''(See paragraph 4.11)''&lt;/ref&gt;  À propos of the word problem it is known that Heyting algebras are not locally finite (no Heyting algebra generated by a finite nonempty set is finite), in contrast to Boolean algebras which are locally finite and whose word problem is decidable.  It is unknown whether free complete Heyting algebras exist except in the case of a single generator where the free Heyting algebra on one generator is trivially completable by adjoining a new top.

In [[mathematics]], specifically in the field of [[complex geometry]], the '''holomorphic tangent space''' of a [[complex manifold]] ''M'' is the [[tangent space]] of the [[smooth manifold]] Σ underlying ''M'' viewed as complex [[vector space]] via the [[Almost complex manifold|almost complex structure]] ''J'' of&amp;nbsp;''M''.  The holomorphic tangent bundle (''T''Σ,&amp;nbsp;''J'') is [[isomorphism|isomorphic]] to a [[subbundle]] of the [[complexification]] of the real [[tangent bundle]], namely the [[Vector bundle#Operations on vector bundles|eigenbundle]] of ''J'' for the eigenvalue +''i'' (compare [[linear complex structure]]). The holomorphic tangent bundle is often denoted by&amp;nbsp;''T''&lt;sup&gt;(1,0)&lt;/sup&gt;''M''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1684">In [[continuum mechanics]], a '''hydrostatic stress''' is an [[isotropic]] [[Stress (mechanics)|stress]] that is given by the weight of water above a certain point. It is often used interchangeably with "[[pressure]]" and is also known as confining stress, particularly in the field of geomechanics. Its magnitude &lt;math&gt;\sigma_h&lt;/math&gt; can be given by:

:&lt;math&gt;\sigma_h = \displaystyle\sum_{i=1}^n \rho_i g h_i&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; is an index denoting each distinct layer of material above the point of interest, &lt;math&gt;\rho_i&lt;/math&gt; is the [[density]] of each layer, &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; is the [[gravitational acceleration]] (assumed constant here; this can be substituted with any [[acceleration]] that is important in defining [[weight]]), and &lt;math&gt;h_i&lt;/math&gt; is the height (or thickness) of each given layer of material. For example, the magnitude of the hydrostatic stress felt at a point under ten meters of fresh water would be

:&lt;math&gt;\sigma_h = \rho_w g h_w =1000 \,\text{kg m}^{-3} \cdot 9.8 \,\text{m s}^{-2} \cdot 10 \,\text{m} =9.8 \cdot {10^4} \text{ kg m}^{-1} \text{s}^{-2} =9.8 \cdot 10^4 \text{ N m}^{-2} &lt;/math&gt;

where the index &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt; indicates "water".

Because the hydrostatic stress is isotropic, it acts equally in all directions. In [[tensor]] form, the hydrostatic stress is equal to

:&lt;math&gt;\sigma_h \cdot I_3 =
\sigma_h \left[ \begin{array}{ccc}
1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \end{array} \right] = 
\left[ \begin{array}{ccc}
\sigma_h &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; \sigma_h &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; \sigma_h \end{array} \right]
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;I_3&lt;/math&gt; is the 3-by-3 [[identity matrix]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="30091">In [[abstract algebra]], an '''interior algebra''' is a certain type of [[algebraic structure]] that encodes the idea of the topological [[Interior (topology)|interior]] of a set.  Interior algebras are to [[topology]] and the [[modal logic]] '''S4''' what [[Boolean algebra (structure)|Boolean algebra]]s are to [[set theory]] and ordinary [[propositional logic]]. Interior algebras form a [[variety (universal algebra)|variety]] of [[modal algebra]]s.

==Definition==
An '''interior algebra''' is an [[algebraic structure]] with the [[signature (logic)|signature]]

:⟨''S'', ·, +, ′, 0, 1, &lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt;⟩

where

:⟨''S'', ·, +, ′, 0, 1⟩

is a [[Boolean algebra (structure)|Boolean algebra]] and postfix &lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt; designates a [[unary operator]], the '''interior operator''', satisfying the identities:

# ''x''&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt; ≤ ''x''
# ''x''&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt; = ''x''&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt;
# (''xy'')&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt; = ''x''&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt;''y''&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt;
# 1&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt; = 1

''x''&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt; is called the '''interior''' of ''x''.

The [[duality (order theory)|dual]] of the interior operator is the '''[[closure operator]]''' &lt;sup&gt;C&lt;/sup&gt; defined by ''x''&lt;sup&gt;C&lt;/sup&gt; = ((''x''′)&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt;)′. ''x''&lt;sup&gt;C&lt;/sup&gt; is called the '''closure''' of ''x''. By the [[duality (order theory)|principle of duality]], the closure operator satisfies the identities:

# ''x''&lt;sup&gt;C&lt;/sup&gt; ≥ ''x''
# ''x''&lt;sup&gt;CC&lt;/sup&gt; = ''x''&lt;sup&gt;C&lt;/sup&gt;
# (''x'' + ''y'')&lt;sup&gt;C&lt;/sup&gt; = ''x''&lt;sup&gt;C&lt;/sup&gt; + ''y''&lt;sup&gt;C&lt;/sup&gt;
# 0&lt;sup&gt;C&lt;/sup&gt; = 0

If the closure operator is taken as primitive, the interior operator can be defined as ''x''&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt; = ((''x''′)&lt;sup&gt;C&lt;/sup&gt;)′. Thus the theory of interior algebras may be formulated using the closure operator instead of the interior operator, in which case one considers '''closure algebras''' of the form ⟨''S'', ·, +, ′, 0, 1, &lt;sup&gt;C&lt;/sup&gt;⟩, where ⟨''S'', ·, +, ′, 0, 1⟩ is again a Boolean algebra and &lt;sup&gt;C&lt;/sup&gt; satisfies the above identities for the closure operator. Closure and interior algebras form [[duality (order theory)|dual]] pairs, and are paradigmatic instances of "Boolean algebras with operators." The early literature on this subject (mainly Polish topology) invoked closure operators, but the interior operator formulation eventually became the norm following the work of [[Wim Blok]].

== Open and closed elements ==
Elements of an interior algebra satisfying the condition ''x''&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt; = ''x'' are called '''[[open set|open]]'''. The [[complement (order theory)|complements]] of open elements are called '''[[closed set|closed]]''' and are characterized by the condition ''x''&lt;sup&gt;C&lt;/sup&gt; = ''x''. An interior of an element is always open and the closure of an element is always closed. Interiors of closed elements are called '''[[regular open set|regular open]]''' and closures of open elements are called '''regular closed'''. Elements which are both open and closed are called '''[[clopen set|clopen]]'''. 0 and 1 are clopen.

An interior algebra is called '''Boolean''' if all its elements are open (and hence clopen). Boolean interior algebras can be identified with ordinary Boolean algebras as their interior and closure operators provide no meaningful additional structure. A special case is the class of '''trivial''' interior algebras which are the single element interior algebras characterized by the identity 0 = 1.

== Morphisms of interior algebras ==

=== Homomorphisms ===
Interior algebras, by virtue of being [[algebraic structure]]s, have [[homomorphism]]s. Given two interior algebras ''A'' and ''B'', a map ''f'' : ''A'' → ''B'' is an '''interior algebra homomorphism''' [[if and only if]] ''f'' is a homomorphism between the underlying Boolean algebras of ''A'' and ''B'', that also preserves interiors and closures. Hence:
*''f''(''x''&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt;) = ''f''(''x'')&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt;;
*''f''(''x''&lt;sup&gt;C&lt;/sup&gt;) = ''f''(''x'')&lt;sup&gt;C&lt;/sup&gt;.

=== Topomorphisms ===
Topomorphisms are another important, and more general, class of [[morphism]]s between interior algebras. A map ''f'' : ''A'' → ''B'' is a [[topomorphism]] if and only if ''f'' is a homomorphism between the Boolean algebras underlying ''A'' and ''B'', that also preserves the open and closed elements of ''A''. Hence:
* If ''x'' is open in ''A'', then ''f''(''x'') is open in ''B'';
* If ''x'' is closed in ''A'', then ''f''(''x'') is closed in ''B''.
(Such morphisms have also been called ''stable homomorphisms'' and ''closure algebra semi-homomorphisms''.) Every interior algebra homomorphism is a topomorphism, but not every topomorphism is an interior algebra homomorphism.

=== Boolean homomorphisms ===
Early research often considered mappings between interior algebras which were homomorphisms of the underlying Boolean algebras but which did not necessarily preserve the interior or closure operator. Such mappings were called '''Boolean homomorphisms'''. (The terms ''closure homomorphism'' or ''topological homomorphism'' were used in the case where these were preserved, but this terminology is now redundant as the standard definition of a homomorphism in [[universal algebra]] requires that it preserves all operations.) Applications involving countably complete interior algebras (in which countable meets and joins always exist, also called ''σ-complete'') typically made use of countably complete Boolean homomorphisms also called '''Boolean σ-homomorphisms''' - these preserve countable meets and joins.

=== Continuous morphisms ===
The earliest generalization of continuity to interior algebras was [[Roman Sikorski|Sikorksi]]'s based on the inverse image map of a continuous map. This is a Boolean homomorphism, preserves unions of sequences and includes the closure of an inverse image in the inverse image of the closure. Sikorski thus defined a ''continuous homomorphism'' as a Boolean σ-homomorphism ''f'' between two σ-complete interior algebras such that ''f''(''x'')&lt;sup&gt;C&lt;/sup&gt; ≤ ''f''(''x''&lt;sup&gt;C&lt;/sup&gt;). This definition had several difficulties: The construction acts [[Functor#Covariance and contravariance|contravariantly]] producing a dual of a continuous map rather than a generalization. On the one hand σ-completeness is too weak to characterize inverse image maps (completeness is required), on the other hand it is too restrictive for a generalization. (Sikorski remarked on using non-σ-complete homomorphisms but included σ-completeness in his axioms for ''closure algebras''.) Later J. Schmid defined a '''continuous homomorphism''' or '''continuous morphism''' for interior algebras as a Boolean homomorphism ''f'' between two interior algebras satisfying ''f''(''x''&lt;sup&gt;C&lt;/sup&gt;) ≤ ''f''(''x'')&lt;sup&gt;C&lt;/sup&gt;. This generalizes the forward image map of a continuous map - the image of a closure is contained in the closure of the image. This construction is [[Functor#Covariance and contravariance|covariant]] but not suitable for category theoretic applications as it only allows construction of continuous morphisms from continuous maps in the case of bijections. (C. Naturman returned to Sikorski's approach while dropping σ-completeness to produce topomorphisms as defined above. In this terminology, Sikorski's original "continuous homomorphisms" are σ-complete topomorphisms between σ-complete interior algebras.)

== Relationships to other areas of mathematics ==

=== Topology ===
Given a [[topological space]] '''''X''''' = ⟨''X'', ''T''⟩ one can form the [[power set]] Boolean algebra of ''X'':

:⟨''P''(''X''), ∩, ∪, ′, ø, ''X''⟩

and extend it to an interior algebra

:'''''A'''''('''''X''''') = ⟨''P''(''X''), ∩, ∪, ′, ø, ''X'', &lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt;⟩,

where &lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt; is the usual topological interior operator. For all ''S'' ⊆ ''X'' it is defined by

:''S''&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt; = ∪ {''O'' : ''O'' ⊆ ''S'' and ''O'' is open in '''''X'''''}

For all ''S'' ⊆ ''X'' the corresponding closure operator is given by

:''S''&lt;sup&gt;C&lt;/sup&gt; = ∩ {''C'' : ''S'' ⊆ ''C'' and ''C'' is closed in '''''X'''''}

''S''&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt; is the largest open subset of ''S'' and ''S''&lt;sup&gt;C&lt;/sup&gt; is the smallest closed superset of ''S'' in '''''X'''''. The open, closed, regular open, regular closed and clopen elements of the interior algebra '''''A'''''('''''X''''') are just the open, closed, regular open, regular closed and clopen subsets of '''''X''''' respectively in the usual topological sense.

Every [[Completeness (order theory)|complete]] [[Atomic (order theory)|atomic]] interior algebra is [[isomorphism|isomorphic]] to an interior algebra of the form '''''A'''''('''''X''''') for some [[topological space]] '''''X'''''.  Moreover, every interior algebra can be [[embedding|embedded]] in such an interior algebra giving a representation of an interior algebra as a '''[[field of sets|topological field of sets]]'''. The properties of the structure '''''A'''''('''''X''''') are the very motivation for the definition of interior algebras. Because of this intimate connection with topology, interior algebras have also been called '''topo-Boolean algebras''' or '''topological Boolean algebras'''.

Given a [[continuous map]] between two topological spaces

:''f''&amp;nbsp;:&amp;nbsp;'''''X'''''&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;'''''Y'''''

we can define a [[completeness (order theory)|complete]] topomorphism

:'''''A'''''(''f'')&amp;nbsp;:&amp;nbsp;'''''A'''''('''''Y''''')&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;'''''A'''''('''''X''''')

by

:'''''A'''''(''f'')(''S'') = ''f''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;[''S'']

for all subsets ''S'' of '''''Y'''''. Every complete topomorphism between two complete atomic interior algebras can be derived in this way. If '''Top''' is the [[category of topological spaces]] and continuous maps and '''Cit''' is the [[category theory|category]] of complete atomic interior algebras and complete topomorphisms then '''Top''' and '''Cit''' are dually isomorphic and '''''A'''''&amp;nbsp;:&amp;nbsp;'''Top'''&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;'''Cit''' is a [[functor|contravariant functor]] that is a dual isomorphism of categories. '''''A'''''(''f'') is a homomorphism if and only if ''f'' is a continuous [[open map]].

Under this dual isomorphism of categories many natural topological properties correspond to algebraic properties, in particular connectedness properties correspond to irreducibility properties:

*'''''X''''' is [[empty set|empty]] if and only if '''''A'''''('''''X''''') is trivial
*'''''X''''' is [[indiscrete space|indiscrete]] if and only if '''''A'''''('''''X''''') is [[simple algebra|simple]]
*'''''X''''' is [[discrete space|discrete]] if and only if '''''A'''''('''''X''''') is Boolean
*'''''X''''' is [[almost discrete space|almost discrete]] if and only if '''''A'''''('''''X''''') is [[semisimple algebraic group|semisimple]]
*'''''X''''' is [[Alexandrov topology|finitely generated]] (Alexandrov) if and only if '''''A'''''('''''X''''') is '''operator complete''' i.e. its interior and closure operators distribute over arbitrary meets and joins respectively
*'''''X''''' is [[connected space|connected]] if and only if '''''A'''''('''''X''''') is [[directly indecomposable]]
*'''''X''''' is [[ultraconnected space|ultraconnected]] if and only if '''''A'''''('''''X''''') is [[finitely subdirectly irreducible]]
*'''''X''''' is [[compact space|compact]] ultra-connected if and only if '''''A'''''('''''X''''') is [[subdirectly irreducible]]

==== Generalized topology ====

The modern formulation of topological spaces in terms of [[topological space|topologies]] of open subsets, motivates an alternative formulation of interior algebras: A '''generalized topological space''' is an [[algebraic structure]] of the form

:⟨''B'', ·, +, ′, 0, 1, ''T''⟩

where ⟨''B'', ·, +, ′, 0, 1⟩ is a Boolean algebra as usual, and ''T'' is a unary relation on ''B'' (subset of ''B'') such that:

#0,1&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;''T''
#''T'' is closed under arbitrary joins (i.e. if a join of an arbitrary subset of ''T'' exists then it will be in ''T'')
#''T'' is closed under finite meets
#For every element ''b'' of ''B'', the join ∑{''a''&amp;nbsp;∈''T'' : ''a''&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;''b''} exists

''T'' is said to be a '''generalized topology''' in the Boolean algebra.

Given an interior algebra its open elements form a generalized topology. Conversely given a generalized topological space

:⟨''B'', ·, +, ′, 0, 1, ''T''⟩

we can define an interior operator on ''B'' by ''b''&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt; = ∑{''a''&amp;nbsp;∈''T'' : ''a''&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;''b''} thereby producing an interior algebra whose open elements are precisely ''T''. Thus generalized topological spaces are equivalent to interior algebras.

Considering interior algebras to be generalized topological spaces, topomorphisms are then the standard homomorphisms of Boolean algebras with added relations, so that standard results from [[universal algebra]] apply.

==== Neighbourhood functions and neighbourhood lattices ====
The topological concept of [[Neighbourhood (mathematics)|neighbourhood]]s can be generalized to interior algebras: An element ''y'' of an interior algebra is said to be a '''neighbourhood''' of an element ''x'' if ''x''&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;''y''&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt;. The set of neighbourhoods of ''x'' is denoted by ''N''(''x'') and forms a [[Filter (mathematics)|filter]]. This leads to another formulation of interior algebras:

A '''neighbourhood function''' on a Boolean algebra is a mapping ''N'' from its underlying set ''B'' to its set of filters, such that:

#For all ''x''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;''B'', max{''y''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;''B'' : ''x''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;''N''(''y'')} exists
#For all ''x'',''y''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;''B'', ''x''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;''N(y)'' if and only if there is a ''z''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;''B'' such that ''y''&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;''z''&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;''x'' and ''z''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;''N(z)''.

The mapping ''N'' of elements of an interior algebra to their filters of neighbourhoods is a neighbourhood function on the underlying Boolean algebra of the interior algebra. Moreover, given a neighbourhood function ''N'' on a Boolean algebra with underlying set ''B'', we can define an interior operator by ''x''&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt; = max {y&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;''B'' : ''x''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;''N(y)''} thereby obtaining an interior algebra. ''N(x)'' will then be precisely the filter of neighbourhoods of ''x'' in this interior algebra. Thus interior algebras are equivalent to Boolean algebras with specified neighbourhood functions.

In terms of neighbourhood functions, the open elements are precisely those elements ''x'' such that ''x''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;''N(x)''. In terms of open elements ''x''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;''N(y)'' if and only if there is an open element ''z'' such that ''y''&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;''z''&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;''x''.

Neighbourhood functions may be defined more generally on [[semilattice|(meet)-semilattice]]s producing the structures known as [[neighbourhood lattice|neighbourhood (semi)lattice]]s. Interior algebras may thus be viewed as precisely the '''Boolean neighbourhood lattices''' i.e. those neighbourhood lattices whose underlying semilattice forms a Boolean algebra.

=== Modal logic ===
Given a theory (set of formal sentences) ''M'' in the modal logic '''S4''', we can form its [[Lindenbaum–Tarski algebra]]:

:'''''L'''''(''M'') = ⟨''M'' / ~, ∧, ∨, ¬, ''F'', ''T'', □⟩

where ~ is the equivalence relation on sentences in ''M'' given by ''p'' ~ ''q'' if and only if ''p'' and ''q'' are [[Logical equivalence|logically equivalent]] in ''M'', and ''M'' / ~ is the set of equivalence classes under this relation. Then '''''L'''''(''M'') is an interior algebra. The interior operator in this case corresponds to the [[modal logic|modal operator]] □ ('''necessarily'''), while the closure operator corresponds to ◊ ('''possibly'''). This construction is a special case of a more general result for [[modal algebra]]s and modal logic.

The open elements of '''''L'''''(''M'') correspond to sentences that are only true if they are '''necessarily''' true, while the closed elements correspond to those that are only false if they are '''necessarily''' false.

Because of their relation to '''S4''', interior algebras are sometimes called '''S4 algebras''' or '''Lewis algebras''', after the [[philosophical logic|logician]] [[Clarence Irving Lewis|C. I. Lewis]], who first proposed the modal logics '''S4''' and '''S5'''.

=== Preorders ===
Since interior algebras are (normal) [[Boolean algebra (structure)|Boolean algebra]]s with [[unary operation|operators]], they can be represented by [[field of sets|fields of sets]] on appropriate relational structures. In particular, since they are [[modal algebra]]s, they can be represented as [[field of sets|fields of sets]] on a set with a single [[binary relation]], called a [[Kripke semantics|modal frame]]. The modal frames corresponding to interior algebras are precisely the [[Preorder|preordered sets]]. [[Preorder|Preordered sets]] (also called ''S4-frames'') provide the [[Kripke semantics]] of the modal logic '''S4''', and the connection between interior algebras and preorders is deeply related to their connection with modal logic.

Given a [[Preorder|preordered set]] '''''X''''' = ⟨''X'', «⟩ we can construct an interior algebra

: '''''B'''''('''''X''''') = ⟨''P''(''X''), ∩, ∪, ′, ø, ''X'', &lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt;⟩

from the [[power set]] [[Boolean algebra (structure)|Boolean algebra]] of ''X'' where the interior operator &lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt; is given by

:''S''&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt; = {''x'' ∈ ''X'' : for all ''y'' ∈ ''X'', ''x'' « ''y'' implies ''y'' ∈ ''S''} for all ''S'' ⊆ ''X''.

The corresponding closure operator is given by

:''S''&lt;sup&gt;C&lt;/sup&gt; = {''x'' ∈ ''X'' : there exists a ''y'' ∈ ''S'' with ''x'' « ''y''} for all ''S'' ⊆ ''X''.

''S''&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt; is the set of all ''worlds'' inaccessible from ''worlds'' outside ''S'', and ''S''&lt;sup&gt;C&lt;/sup&gt; is the set of all ''worlds'' accessible from some ''world'' in ''S''. Every interior algebra can be [[embedding|embedded]] in an interior algebra of the form '''''B'''''('''''X''''') for some [[Preorder|preordered set]] '''''X''''' giving the above-mentioned representation as a [[field of sets]] (a '''preorder field''').

This construction and representation theorem is a special case of the more general result for [[modal algebra]]s and modal frames. In this regard, interior algebras are particularly interesting because of their connection to [[topology]]. The construction provides the [[Preorder|preordered set]] '''''X''''' with a [[topological space|topology]], the [[Alexandrov topology]], producing a [[topological space]] '''''T'''''('''''X''''') whose open sets are:

:{''O'' ⊆ ''X'' : for all ''x'' ∈ ''O'' and all ''y'' ∈ ''X'', ''x'' « ''y'' implies ''y'' ∈ ''O''}.

The corresponding closed sets are:

:{''C'' ⊆ ''X'' : for all ''x'' ∈ ''C'' and all ''y'' ∈ ''X'', ''y'' « ''x'' implies ''y'' ∈ ''C''}.

In other words, the open sets are the ones whose ''worlds'' are inaccessible from outside (the '''up-sets'''), and the closed sets are the ones for which every outside ''world'' is inaccessible from inside (the '''down-sets'''). Moreover, '''''B'''''('''''X''''') = '''''A'''''('''''T'''''('''''X''''')).

=== Monadic Boolean algebras ===
Any [[monadic Boolean algebra]] can be considered to be an interior algebra where the interior operator is the universal quantifier and the closure operator is the existential quantifier. The monadic Boolean algebras are then precisely the [[Variety (universal algebra)|variety]] of interior algebras satisfying the identity ''x''&lt;sup&gt;IC&lt;/sup&gt; = ''x''&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt;. In other words, they are precisely the interior algebras in which every open element is closed or equivalently, in which every closed element is open. Moreover, such interior algebras are precisely the [[Semisimple algebra|semisimple]] interior algebras. They are also the interior algebras corresponding to the modal logic '''S5''', and so have also been called '''S5 algebras'''.

In the relationship between preordered sets and interior algebras they correspond to the case where the preorder is an [[equivalence relation]], reflecting the fact that such preordered sets provide the Kripke semantics for '''S5'''. This also reflects the relationship between the [[monadic logic]] of quantification (for which monadic Boolean algebras provide an [[Lindenbaum–Tarski algebra|algebraic description]]) and '''S5''' where the modal operators □ ('''necessarily''') and ◊ ('''possibly''') can be interpreted in the Kripke semantics using monadic universal and existential quantification, respectively, without reference to an accessibility relation.

=== Heyting algebras ===
The open elements of an interior algebra form a [[Heyting algebra]] and the closed elements form a [[duality (order theory)|dual]] Heyting algebra. The regular open elements and regular closed elements correspond to the pseudo-complemented elements and [[duality (order theory)|dual]] pseudo-complemented elements of these algebras respectively and thus form Boolean algebras. The clopen elements correspond to the complemented elements and form a common subalgebra of these Boolean algebras as well as of the interior algebra itself. Every [[Heyting algebra]] can be represented as the open elements of an interior algebra and the latter may be chosen to an interior algebra generated by its open elements - such interior algebras correspond one to one with Heyting algebras (up to isomorphism) being the free Boolean extensions of the latter.

Heyting algebras [[Lindenbaum–Tarski algebra|play the same role]] for [[intuitionistic logic]] that interior algebras play for the modal logic '''S4''' and [[Boolean algebra (structure)|Boolean algebra]]s play for [[propositional logic]]. The relation between Heyting algebras and interior algebras reflects the relationship between intuitionistic logic and '''S4''', in which one can interpret theories of intuitionistic logic as '''S4''' theories [[deductive closure|closed]] under [[logical truth|necessity]]. The one to one correspondence between Heyting algebras and interior algebras generated by their open elements reflects the correspondence between extensions of intuitionistic logic and normal extensions of the modal logic '''S4.Grz'''.

=== Derivative algebras ===
Given an interior algebra '''''A''''', the closure operator obeys the axioms of the [[Derivative algebra (abstract algebra)|derivative operator]], &lt;sup&gt;D&lt;/sup&gt;. Hence we can form a [[Abstract algebra|derivative algebra]] '''''D'''''('''''A''''') with the same underlying Boolean algebra as '''''A''''' by using the closure operator as a derivative operator.

Thus interior algebras are [[Derivative algebra (abstract algebra)|derivative algebras]]. From this perspective, they are precisely the [[variety (universal algebra)|variety]] of derivative algebras satisfying the identity ''x''&lt;sup&gt;D&lt;/sup&gt; ≥ ''x''. Derivative algebras provide the appropriate [[Lindenbaum–Tarski algebra|algebraic semantics]] for the modal logic '''WK4'''. Hence derivative algebras stand to topological [[derived set (mathematics)|derived set]]s and '''WK4''' as interior/closure algebras stand to topological interiors/closures and '''S4'''.
 
Given a derivative algebra '''''V''''' with derivative operator &lt;sup&gt;D&lt;/sup&gt;, we can form an interior algebra '''''I'''''('''''V''''') with the same underlying Boolean algebra as '''''V''''', with interior and closure operators defined by ''x''&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt; = ''x''·''x''&amp;nbsp;′&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;D&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;′ and ''x''&lt;sup&gt;C&lt;/sup&gt; = ''x'' + ''x''&lt;sup&gt;D&lt;/sup&gt;, respectively. Thus every derivative algebra can be regarded as an interior algebra. Moreover, given an interior algebra '''''A''''', we have '''''I'''''('''''D'''''('''''A''''')) = '''''A'''''. However, '''''D'''''('''''I'''''('''''V''''')) = '''''V''''' does ''not'' necessarily hold for every derivative algebra '''''V'''''.

==Stone duality and representation for interior algebras==
[[Stone duality]] provides a category theoretic duality between Boolean algebras and a class of topological spaces known as [[Boolean space]]s. Building on nascent ideas of relational semantics (later formalized by [[Saul Kripke|Kripke]]) and a result of R. S. Pierce, [[Bjarni Jónsson|Jónsson]], [[Alfred Tarski|Tarski]] and G. Hansoul extended Stone duality to [[Boolean algebras with operators]] by equipping Boolean spaces with relations that correspond to the operators via a [[Field of sets#Complex algebras and fields of sets on relational structures|power set construction]]. In the case of interior algebras the interior (or closure) operator corresponds to a pre-order on the Boolean space. Homomorphisms between interior algebras correspond to a class of continuous maps between the Boolean spaces known as '''pseudo-epimorphisms''' or '''p-morphisms''' for short. This generalization of Stone duality to interior algebras based on the Jónsson–Tarski representation was investigated by Leo Esakia and is also known as the ''Esakia duality for S4-algebras (interior algebras)'' and is closely related to the [[Esakia duality]] for Heyting algebras.

Whereas the Jónsson–Tarski generalization of Stone duality applies to Boolean algebras with operators in general, the connection between interior algebras and topology allows for another method of generalizing Stone duality that is unique to interior algebras. An intermediate step in the development of Stone duality is [[Stone's representation theorem for Boolean algebras|Stone's representation theorem]] which represents a Boolean algebra as a [[field of sets]]. The Stone topology of the corresponding Boolean space is then generated using the field of sets as a [[topological basis]]. Building on the [[topological semantics]] introduced by Tang Tsao-Chen for Lewis's modal logic, [[J.C.C. McKinsey|McKinsey]] and Tarski showed that by generating a topology equivalent to using only the complexes that correspond to open elements as a basis, a representation of an interior algebra is obtained as a [[Field of sets#topological field of sets|topological field of sets]] - a field of sets on a topological space that is closed with respect to taking interiors or closures. By equipping topological fields of sets with appropriate morphisms known as '''field maps''' C. Naturman showed that this approach can be formalized as a category theoretic Stone duality in which the usual Stone duality for Boolean algebras corresponds to the case of interior algebras having redundant interior operator (Boolean interior algebras).

The pre-order obtained in the Jónsson–Tarski approach corresponds to the accessibility relation in the Kripke semantics for an S4 theory, while the intermediate field of sets corresponds to a representation of the Lindenbaum–Tarski algebra for the theory using the sets of possible worlds in the Kripke semantics in which sentences of the theory hold. Moving from the field of sets to a Boolean space somewhat obfuscates this connection. By treating fields of sets on pre-orders as a category in its own right this deep connection can be formulated as a category theoretic duality that generalizes Stone representation without topology. R. Goldblatt had shown that with restrictions to appropriate homomorphisms such a duality can be formulated for arbitrary modal algebras and modal frames. Naturman showed that in the case of interior algebras this duality applies to more general topomorphisms and can be factored via a category theoretic functor through the duality with topological fields of sets. The latter represent the Lindenbaum–Tarski algebra using sets of points satisfying sentences of the S4 theory in the topological semantics. The pre-order can be obtained as the specialization pre-order of the McKinsey-Tarski topology. The Esakia duality can be recovered via a functor that replaces the field of sets with the Boolean space it generates. Via a functor that instead replaces the pre-order with its corresponding Alexandrov topology, an alternative representation of the interior algebra as a field of sets is obtained where the topology is the Alexandrov bico-reflection of the McKinsey-Tarski topology. The approach of formulating a topological duality for interior algebras using both the Stone topology of the Jónsson–Tarski approach and the Alexandrov topology of the pre-order to form a bi-topological space has been investigated by G. Bezhanishvili, R.Mines, and P.J. Morandi. The McKinsey-Tarski topology of an interior algebra is the intersection of the former two topologies.

==Metamathematics==
Grzegorczyk proved the elementary theory of closure algebras [[decision problem|undecidable]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Andrzej Grzegorczyk]] (1951) "Undecidability of some topological theories," ''Fundamenta Mathematicae 38'': 137-52.&lt;/ref&gt; Naturman demonstrated that the theory is [[hereditarily undecidable]] (all its subtheories are undecidable) and demonstrated an infinite chain of elementary classes of interior algebras with hereditarily undecidable theories.

'''James Maurice Wilson''' (6 November 1836, Castletown, [[Isle of Man]] – 15 April 1931, Steep, Petersfield, Hampshire, England) was a British priest in the [[Church of England]] as well as a theologian, teacher and [[astronomer]].

==Early life==

Wilson and his twin brother, Edward Pears Wilson, attended [[King William's College]] on the [[Isle of Man]] from August 1848 to midsummer 1853 (his twin died in December 1856). Their father Edward, vicar of [[Nocton]] in Lincolnshire, had earlier been headmaster there. According to his autobiography, Wilson had a rather unhappy time at King William's College. He later studied at [[Sedbergh School]].

Wilson entered [[St. John's College, Cambridge|St John's College]], [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]], in 1855, where he was [[Senior Wrangler]] in 1859.&lt;ref&gt;{{acad|id=WL855JM|name=Wilson, James Maurice}}&lt;/ref&gt; He received a [[Master of Arts]] degree in 1862 and was a fellow from 1859 to 1868.

==Career==

Wilson was a major figure in the development and reform of Victorian public schools and promoted the teaching of science, which had until then been neglected. He was maths and science master at [[Rugby School]] from 1859 to 1879 and headmaster of [[Clifton College]] from 1879 to 1890.

He made astronomical observations (particularly of [[double star]]s) at Temple Observatory at Rugby with his former student [[George Mitchell Seabroke]]. Temple Observatory was named after [[Frederick Temple]], headmaster of Rugby School, who later became [[Bishop of Exeter]] and [[Archbishop of Canterbury]].

Wilson was encouraged by Temple to write the textbook ''Elementary Geometry'', which was published in 1868. Until that time, [[Euclid's Elements|Euclid's ''Elements'']] had remained the standard textbook used in British schools.

With [[Joseph Gledhill]] and [[Edward Crossley]], Wilson co-wrote ''Handbook of Double Stars'' in 1879, which became a standard reference work in astronomy. His astronomical observations seem to have come to an end after he left Rugby and went to Clifton.

While at Clifton, he successfully pushed for the creation of St Agnes Park in [[Bristol]], as part of a plan to improve the lives of the urban poor.

After his teaching career, he became Vicar of [[Rochdale]], [[Archdeacon of Manchester]] from 1890 to 1905, a canon of [[Worcester Cathedral]] from 1905 to 1926 and vice-dean of the cathedral. He was [[Hulsean Lectures|Hulsean lecturer]] at Cambridge in 1898; [[Lady Margaret Beaufort|Lady Margaret]] Preacher at Cambridge in 1900; and Lecturer in Pastoral Theology at Cambridge in 1902.

He wholeheartedly accepted the [[theory of evolution]] and its implications for the literal interpretation of the Bible. He gave two lectures in 1892 in which he accepted Darwinism and argued that it was compatible with a higher view of Christianity; the lectures were published by the [[Society for the Promotion of Christian Knowledge]], which had a few years earlier strongly opposed Darwinian ideas.

In 1921, he served for one year as president of The [[Mathematical Association]] of the UK.

In 1925 he wrote an essay entitled "The Religious Effect of the Idea of Evolution". He wrote a number of books, including ''Life after Death'' "with replies by Sir [[Arthur Conan Doyle]]" in 1920. In addition to spiritual works, he co-wrote an astronomy book on double stars (mentioned above) and mathematical books on [[geometry]] and [[conic section]]s.  He contributed the article "On two fragments of geometrical treatises found in Worcester Cathedral" to the ''[[Mathematical Gazette]]'' (March 1911, p.&amp;nbsp;19).

==Family==

In 1868 he married his first wife, Annie Elizabeth Moore. Their first child was the leading civil servant [[Mona Wilson]].&lt;ref name=usemeagain&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/70137|title=Mona Wilson|doi=10.1093/ref:odnb/70137}}&lt;/ref&gt; His first wife died after giving birth to their fourth child in 1878. She was a cousin once removed of [[Arthur William Moore]], a proponent of the [[Manx language]].

In 1883 he married his second wife, Georgina Mary Talbot. Their sons included Sir [[Arnold Talbot Wilson]], who became a British colonial administrator in [[Baghdad]] and was killed in action in [[World War II]]; 2nd Lt. Hugh Stanley Wilson (1885&amp;ndash;1915), who died in [[World War I]] and is buried in the military cemetery at [[Hébuterne]], [[Pas de Calais]]; and the tenor Sir [[Steuart Wilson]].  From his notes, Arnold and Steuart published the posthumous ''James M. Wilson: An Autobiography'' (London, Sidgwick &amp; Jackson, 1932)

'''Mario Pieri''' (22 June 1860 – 1 March 1913) was an [[Italy|Italian]] [[mathematician]] who is known for his work on [[foundations of geometry]].

==Biography==
Pieri was born in [[Lucca]], Italy, the son of Pellegrino Pieri and Ermina Luporini. Pellegrino was a lawyer. Pieri began his higher education at [[University of Bologna]] where he drew the attention of [[Salvatore Pincherle]]. Obtaining a scholarship, Pieri transferred to ''Scuola Normale Superiore'' in [[Pisa]]. There he took his degree in 1884 and worked first at a technical secondary school in Pisa.

When the opportunity to teach [[projective geometry]] at the military academy in [[Turin]] arose, Pieri moved there. By 1888 he was assisting in instructing that subject also at the [[University of Turin]]. In 1891 he became ''libero docente'' at the university, giving elective courses. Pieri continued teaching in Turin until 1900 when he won a competition for the position of ''extraordinary professor'' at [[University of Catania]] on the island of [[Sicily]]. In 1908 he moved to [[University of Parma]], and in 1911 fell ill. Pieri died in Andrea di Compito ([[Capannori]]), not far from Lucca.

[[Von Staudt (mathematician)|Von Staudt's]] ''Geometrie der Lage'' (1847) was a much admired text on projective geometry. In 1889 Pieri translated it as ''Geometria di Posizione'', a publication that included a study of the life and work of von Staudt written by [[Corrado Segre]], the initiator of the project.

Pieri also came under the influence of [[Giuseppe Peano]] at Turin. He contributed to the [[Formulario mathematico]], and Peano placed nine of Pieri's papers for publication with the Academy of Sciences of Turin between 1895 and 1912. They shared a passion for reducing geometric ideas to their logical form and expressing these ideas symbolically.

In 1898 Pieri wrote ''I principii della geometria di posizione composti in un sistema logico-deduttivo''. According to J.T. Smith (2010) it is
:based on nineteen sequentially independent axioms – each independent of the preceding ones – which are introduced one by one as they are needed in the development, thus allowing the reader to determine on which axioms a given theorem depends.

Pieri was invited to address the [[International Congress of Philosophy]] in 1900 in [[Paris]]. Since this was also the year he moved from Turin to Sicily, he declined to attend but sent a paper "Sur la Géométrie envisagée comme un système purement logique" which was delivered by [[Louis Couturat]]. The ideas were also advanced by [[Alessandro Padoa]] at both that Congress and the [[International Congress of Mathematicians]] also held in Paris that year.

In 1900 Pieri wrote ''Monographia del punto e del moto'', which Smith calls the ''Point and Motion'' memoire. It is noteworthy as using only two [[primitive notion]]s, [[point (geometry)|point]] and [[motion (geometry)|motion]] to develop axioms for geometry. Alessandro Padoa shared in this expression of Peano's logico-geometrical program that reduced the number of primitive notions from the ''four'' used by [[Moritz Pasch]].

The research into the foundations of geometry led to another formulation in 1908 in a ''Point and Sphere'' memoire. Smith (2010) describes it as
:a full axiomatization of Euclidean geometry based solely on the primitive concepts ''point'' and ''equidistance'' of two points ''N'' and ''P'' from a third point ''O'', written ''ON'' = ''OP''.
This memoire was translated into [[Polish language|Polish]] in 1915 by S. Kwietniewski. A young [[Alfred Tarski]] encountered the text and carried forward Pieri's program, as recounted by Smith.

In 2002 Avellone, Brigaglia &amp; Zappulla gave a modern evaluation of Pieri's contribution to geometry:
:Pieri's work was very influential. [[Bertrand Russell|B. Russell]] and [[Louis Couturat|L. Couturat]] rightly regarded him as the founder of mathematics as a hypothetical-deductive science. His precision, his rigour, and his analytical clarity are unrivaled by other Italian geometers, perhaps with the exception of Peano.

Giuseppe Peano wrote this tribute to Pieri upon his death:
:Pieri was totally dedicated to science and teaching. He was an untiring worker, honest, and of a singular modesty. When, some twenty years ago, the professors in Italy agitated for higher salaries, Pieri declared that their salaries were already above the work they did and their merit.
::from Hubert C. Kennedy (1980), ''Peano'', page 142, D. Reidel/Kluwer.

Mario Pieri's collected works were published by the [[Italian Mathematical Union]] in 1980 under the title ''Opere sui fondamenti della matematica'' (Edizioni Cremonese, Bologna).

'''Mark Richard Jerrum''' (born 1955) is a [[Great Britain|British]] computer scientist and [[computational theorist]].

Jerrum received his [[Ph.D.]] in computer science 'On the complexity of evaluating multivariate polynomials'&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mark|first=Jerrum,|date=1981|title=On the complexity of evaluating multivariate polynomials|url=https://www.era.lib.ed.ac.uk/handle/1842/12296|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1981 from [[University of Edinburgh]] under the supervision of [[Leslie Valiant]].&lt;ref&gt;{{MathGenealogy|71827}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is professor of [[pure mathematics]] at [[Queen Mary, University of London]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.maths.qmul.ac.uk/~mj/ Personnel page],  [[Queen Mary, University of London]].&lt;/ref&gt;

With his student [[Alistair Sinclair]], Jerrum investigated the mixing behaviour of [[Markov chain]]s to construct [[approximation algorithms]] for counting problems such as the [[computing the permanent]], with applications in diverse fields such as matching algorithms, geometric algorithms, mathematical programming, statistics, physics-inspired applications, and dynamical systems. This work has been highly influential in theoretical computer science and was recognised with the [[Gödel Prize]] in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sigact.org/Prizes/Godel/1996.html Gödel Prize citation], 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; A refinement of these methods led to a fully polynomial-time randomised approximation algorithm for computing the permanent, for which Jerrum and his co-authors received the [[Fulkerson Prize]] in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ams.org/notices/200611/comm-fulkerson.pdf 2006 Fulkerson Prize citation], ''Notices of the AMS'', December 2006, volume 53, number 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Markov's principle''', named after [[Andrey Markov (Soviet mathematician)|Andrey Markov Jr]], is a specific statement in [[computability theory]] that is obviously true classically (i.e. it is a [[Validity (logic)|logical validity]]), but must be proved when using [[constructivism (mathematics)|constructive]] mathematics. 
There are many equivalent formulations of Markov's principle.

== Statements of the principle ==
In the language of [[computability theory]], Markov's principle is a formal expression of the claim that if it is impossible that an algorithm does not terminate, then it does terminate. This is equivalent to the claim that if a set and its complement are both [[computably enumerable]], then the set is [[recursive set|decidable]]. 

In [[predicate logic]], if ''P'' is a predicate over the [[natural number]]s, it is expressed as:

:&lt;math&gt;(\forall n (P(n) \vee \neg P(n)) \wedge \neg \forall n \neg P(n)) \rightarrow \exists n\;P(n)&lt;/math&gt;

That is, if ''P'' is decidable, and it cannot be false for every natural number ''n'', then it is true for some&amp;nbsp;''n''.  (In general, a predicate ''P'' over some domain is called ''decidable'' if for every ''x'' in the domain, either ''P''(''x'') is true, or ''P''(''x'') is not true, which is not always the case constructively.)

It is equivalent in the language of [[Heyting arithmetic|arithmetic]] to:
:&lt;math&gt;\neg \neg \exists n\;f(n)=0 \rightarrow \exists n\;f(n)=0,&lt;/math&gt;
for &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; a [[computable function|total recursive function]] on the natural numbers.

It is equivalent, in the language of [[real analysis]], to the following principles:

* For each real number ''x'', if it is contradictory that ''x'' is equal to 0, then there exists ''y''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;[[rational number|Q]] such that 0&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''y''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;|''x''|, often expressed by saying that ''x'' is [[apartness relation|apart]] from, or constructively unequal to,&amp;nbsp;0.
* For each real number ''x'', if it is contradictory that ''x'' is equal to&amp;nbsp;0, then there exists ''y''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;R such that ''xy''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1.

== Realizability ==

If constructive arithmetic is translated using [[realizability]] into a classical meta-theory that proves the &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt;-consistency of the relevant classical theory (for example, Peano Arithmetic if we are studying [[Heyting arithmetic]]), then Markov's principle is justified: a realizer is the constant function that takes a realization that &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is not everywhere false to the [[unbounded search]] that successively checks if &lt;math&gt;P(0), P(1), P(2),\dots&lt;/math&gt; is true. If &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is not everywhere false, then by &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt;-consistency there must be a term for which &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; holds, and each term will be checked by the search eventually. If however &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; does not hold anywhere, then the domain of the constant function must be empty, so although the search does not halt it still holds vacuously that the function is a realizer. By the Law of the Excluded Middle (in our classical metatheory), &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; must either hold nowhere or not hold nowhere, therefore this constant function is a realizer.

If instead the realizability interpretation is used in a constructive meta-theory, then it is not justified. Indeed, for first-order arithmetic, Markov's principle exactly captures the difference between a constructive and classical meta-theory. Specifically, a statement is provable in [[Heyting arithmetic]] with [[Church's thesis (constructive mathematics)|Extended Church's thesis]] if and only if there is a number that provably realizes it in [[Heyting arithmetic]]; and it is provable in [[Heyting arithmetic]] with [[Church's thesis (constructive mathematics)|Extended Church's thesis]] ''and Markov's principle'' if and only if there is a number that provably realizes it in [[Peano arithmetic]]. 

Modified [[realizability]] does not justify Markov's principle, even if classical logic is used in the meta-theory: there is no realizer in the language of [[simply typed lambda calculus]] as this language is not [[Turing-complete]] and arbitrary loops cannot be defined in it.

== Markov's rule ==
'''Markov's rule''' is the formulation of Markov's principle as a rule. It states that &lt;math&gt;\exists n\;P(n)&lt;/math&gt; is derivable as soon as &lt;math&gt;\neg \neg \exists n\;P(n)&lt;/math&gt; is, for &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; decidable. It was proved by Anne S. Troelstra&lt;ref&gt;Anne S. Troelstra. Metamathematical Investigation of Intuitionistic Arithmetic and Analysis, Springer Verlag (1973), Theorem 4.2.4 of the 2nd edition.&lt;/ref&gt; that Markov's rule is an [[admissible rule]] in [[Heyting arithmetic]]. Later on, the logician [[Harvey Friedman]] showed that Markov's rule is an admissible rule in all of [[intuitionistic logic]], [[Heyting arithmetic]], and various other intuitionistic theories,&lt;ref&gt;Harvey Friedman. Classically and Intuitionistically Provably Recursive Functions. In Scott, D. S. and Muller, G. H. Editors, Higher Set Theory, Volume 699 of Lecture Notes in Mathematics, Springer Verlag (1978), pp. 21–28.&lt;/ref&gt; using the [[Friedman translation]].

== Weak Markov's principle ==
A weaker form of Markov's principle may be stated in the language of analysis as

: &lt;math&gt;\forall x\in\mathbb{R}\ (\forall y\in\mathbb{R}\ \neg\neg(0&lt;y) \vee \neg\neg(y&lt;x)) \to 0&lt;x.&lt;/math&gt;

This form can be justified by [[L. E. J. Brouwer|Brouwer's]] [[Brouwer's continuity principles|continuity principles]], whereas the stronger form contradicts them. Thus it can be derived from intuitionistic, realizability, and classical reasoning, in each case for different reasons, but this principle is not valid in the general constructive sense of Bishop.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ulrich Kohlenbach]], "[http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.24.7455 On weak Markov's principle]". ''Mathematical Logic Quarterly'' (2002), vol 48, issue S1, pp. 59–65.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Methoden der mathematischen Physik''''' (Methods of Mathematical Physics) is a 1924 book, in two volumes totalling around 1000 pages, published under the names of [[David Hilbert]] and [[Richard Courant]]. It was a comprehensive treatment of the "methods of [[mathematical physics]]" of the time. The second volume is devoted to the theory of [[partial differential equation]]s. It contains presages of the [[finite element method]], on which Courant would work subsequently, and which would eventually become basic to [[numerical analysis]].

The material of the book was worked up from the content of Hilbert's lectures. While Courant played the major editorial role, many at the [[University of Göttingen]] were involved in the writing-up, and in that sense it was a collective production.

On its appearance in 1924 it apparently had little direct connection to the [[Quantum mechanics|quantum theory]] questions at the centre of the [[theoretical physics]] of the time. That changed within two years, since the formulation of [[Schrödinger's equation]] made the Hilbert-Courant techniques of immediate relevance to the new [[Schrödinger equation#Particles as waves|wave mechanics]].

There was a second edition (1931/7), wartime edition in the USA (1943), and a third German edition (1968). The English version ''Methods of Mathematical Physics'' (1953) was revised by Courant, and the second volume had extensive work done on it by the faculty of the [[Courant Institute]]. The books quickly gained the reputation as classics, and are among most highly referenced books in advanced mathematical physics courses.

In [[classical mechanics]], a physical system is termed a '''monogenic system''' if the force acting on the system can be modelled in an especially convenient mathematical form (see mathematical definition below).  In [[physics]], among the most studied physical systems are monogenic systems.  

In [[Lagrangian mechanics]], the property of being monogenic is a necessary condition for the equivalence of different formulations of principle.  If a physical system is both a [[holonomic system]] and a monogenic system, then it is possible to derive [[Lagrangian mechanics|Lagrange's equation]]s from [[d'Alembert's principle]]; it is also possible to derive [[Lagrangian mechanics|Lagrange's equation]]s from [[Hamilton's principle]].&lt;ref name=goldstein2002&gt;{{cite book |last1=Goldstein |first1=Herbert |authorlink1=Herbert Goldstein |last2=Poole | first2=Charles P., Jr. |last3=Safko |first3=John L. |title=Classical Mechanics |edition=3rd |year=2002 |url=http://www.pearsonhighered.com/educator/product/Classical-Mechanics/9780201657029.page |isbn=0-201-65702-3 |publisher=Addison Wesley |location=San Francisco, CA |pages=18–21,45}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term was introduced by [[Cornelius Lanczos]] in his book ''The Variational Principles of Mechanics'' (1970).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://philsci-archive.pitt.edu/1937/1/BetLMLag.pdf|title=Between Laws and Models: Some Philosophical Morals of Lagrangian Mechanics|last1=J. |first1=Butterfield |date=3 September 2004 |website=PhilSci-Archive |accessdate=23 January 2015|pages=43}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Lanczos |last1=Cornelius |title=The Variational Principles of Mechanics |location= Toronto |publisher=[[University of Toronto Press]] |year=1970 |isbn=0-8020-1743-6 |pages=30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Monogenic systems have excellent mathematical characteristics and are well suited for mathematical analysis.  Pedagogically, within the discipline of mechanics, it is considered a logical starting point for any serious physics endeavour.  

==Mathematical definition==

In a physical system, if all forces, with the exception of the constraint forces, are derivable from the [[generalized potential|generalized scalar potential]], and this generalized scalar potential is a function of [[generalized coordinate]]s, [[generalized coordinate#Generalized velocities and kinetic energy|generalized velocities]], or time, then, this system is a '''monogenic system'''.

Expressed using equations, the exact relationship between [[generalized force]] &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}_i&lt;/math&gt; and generalized potential &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{V}(q_1,\ q_2,\ \dots,\ q_N,\ \dot{q}_1,\ \dot{q}_2,\ \dots,\ \dot{q}_N,\ t)&lt;/math&gt; is as follows:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}_i= - \frac{\partial \mathcal{V}}{\partial q_i}+\frac{d}{dt}\left(\frac{\partial \mathcal{V}}{\partial \dot{q_i}}\right);&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;q_i&lt;/math&gt; is generalized coordinate, &lt;math&gt;\dot{q_i} &lt;/math&gt; is generalized velocity, and &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; is time.

If the generalized potential in a monogenic system depends only on generalized coordinates, and not on generalized velocities and time, then, this system is a [[Conservative force|conservative system]].The relationship between generalized force and generalized potential is as follows: 

::&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}_i= - \frac{\partial \mathcal{V}}{\partial q_i}&lt;/math&gt; ；

'''Napoléon Bonaparte''' ({{IPAc-en|n|ə|ˈ|p|oʊ|l|i|ən|_|ˈ|b|oʊ|n|ə|p|ɑr|t}};&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/napoleon "Napoleon"], [http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/bonaparte "Bonaparte"]. ''[[Random House Webster's Unabridged Dictionary]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; {{IPA-fr|napoleɔ̃ bɔnɑpaʁt|lang}}, {{lang-it|Napoleone Bonaparte}}; 15 August 1769 – 5 May 1821) was a French statesman and military leader who rose to prominence during the [[French Revolution]] and led [[Napoleon Bonaparte's battle record|several successful campaigns]] during the [[French Revolutionary Wars]]. He was [[Emperor of the French]] from 1804 until 1814 and again briefly in 1815 during the [[Hundred Days]]. Napoleon dominated European and global affairs for more than a decade while leading France against a series of coalitions in the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. He won most of these wars and the vast majority of his battles, building a [[First French Empire|large empire]] that ruled over continental Europe before its final collapse in 1815. He is considered one of the greatest commanders in history, and his wars and campaigns are studied at military schools worldwide. Napoleon's political and cultural legacy has endured as one of the most celebrated and controversial leaders in human history.&lt;ref name="Roberts, Andrew 2014"&gt;Roberts, Andrew.

He was born '''Napoleone di Buonaparte''' ({{IPA-it|napoleˈoːne di ˌbwɔnaˈparte|lang}}) in [[Corsica]] to a relatively modest family of [[Italians|Italian]] origin from the minor [[Nobility of Italy|nobility]]. He was serving as an artillery officer in the French army when the French Revolution erupted in 1789. He rapidly rose through the ranks of the military, seizing the new opportunities presented by the Revolution and becoming a general at age 24. The [[French Directory]] eventually gave him command of the [[Army of Italy (France)|Army of Italy]] after he suppressed a [[13 Vendémiaire|revolt against the government]] from royalist insurgents. At age 26, he began his [[Italian campaigns of the French Revolutionary Wars|first military campaign]] against the Austrians and the Italian monarchs aligned with the Habsburgs—winning virtually every battle,  conquering the Italian Peninsula in a year while establishing "[[sister republic]]s" with local support, and becoming a war hero in France. In 1798, he led a [[French campaign in Egypt and Syria|military expedition to Egypt]] that served as a springboard to political power. He orchestrated a [[Coup of 18 Brumaire|coup in November 1799]] and became [[French Consulate|First Consul]] of the Republic. His ambition and public approval inspired him to go further, and he became the first Emperor of the French in 1804. Intractable differences with the British meant that the French were facing a [[War of the Third Coalition|Third Coalition]] by 1805. Napoleon shattered this coalition with decisive victories in the [[Ulm Campaign]] and a historic triumph over the [[Russian Empire]] and [[Austrian Empire]] at the [[Battle of Austerlitz]] which led to the [[dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire]]. In 1806, the [[War of the Fourth Coalition|Fourth Coalition]] took up arms against him because [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]] became worried about growing French influence on the continent. Napoleon quickly defeated Prussia at the [[Battle of Jena–Auerstedt|battles of Jena and Auerstedt]], then marched his ''[[Grande Armée]]'' deep into [[Eastern Europe]] and annihilated the Russians in June 1807 at the [[Battle of Friedland]]. France then forced the defeated nations of the Fourth Coalition to sign the [[Treaties of Tilsit]] in July 1807, bringing an uneasy peace to the continent. Tilsit signified the high-water mark of the French Empire. In 1809, the Austrians and the British challenged the French again during the [[War of the Fifth Coalition]], but Napoleon solidified his grip over Europe after triumphing at the [[Battle of Wagram]] in July.

Napoleon then invaded the [[Iberian Peninsula]], hoping to extend the [[Continental System]] and choke off British trade with the European mainland, and declared his brother [[Joseph Bonaparte]] the [[King of Spain]] in 1808. The Spanish and the Portuguese revolted with British support. The [[Peninsular War]] lasted six years, featured extensive [[guerrilla warfare]], and ended in victory for the Allies. The Continental System caused recurring diplomatic conflicts between France and its client states, especially Russia. The Russians were unwilling to bear the economic consequences of reduced trade and routinely violated the Continental System, enticing Napoleon into another war. The French launched a major [[French invasion of Russia|invasion of Russia]] in the summer of 1812. The campaign destroyed Russian cities but resulted in the collapse of the ''Grande Armée'' and inspired a renewed push against Napoleon by his enemies. In 1813, Prussia and Austria joined Russian forces in the [[War of the Sixth Coalition]] against France. A lengthy military campaign culminated in a large Allied army defeating Napoleon at the [[Battle of Leipzig]] in October 1813, but his tactical victory at the minor [[Battle of Hanau]] allowed retreat onto French soil. The Allies then [[1814 campaign in France|invaded France]] and captured Paris in the spring of 1814, forcing Napoleon to abdicate in April. He was exiled to the island of [[Elba]] off the coast of [[Tuscany]], and the [[Bourbon dynasty]] was [[Bourbon Restoration|restored to power]]. However, Napoleon escaped from Elba in February 1815 and took control of France once again. The Allies responded by forming a [[War of the Seventh Coalition|Seventh Coalition]] which defeated him at the [[Battle of Waterloo]] in June. The British exiled him to the remote island of [[Saint Helena]] in the South Atlantic, where he died six years later at the age of 51.

Napoleon's influence on the modern world brought liberal reforms to the numerous territories that he conquered and controlled, such as the [[Low Countries]], [[Switzerland]], and large parts of modern [[Italy]] and [[Germany]]. He implemented fundamental liberal policies in France and throughout Western Europe.{{#tag:ref|He established a system of public education,{{sfn|Grab|2003|page=56}} abolished the vestiges of [[feudalism]],&lt;ref name="Broers"&gt;Broers, M. and Hicks, P.

British historian [[Andrew Roberts (historian)|Andrew Roberts]] states: "The ideas that underpin our modern world—meritocracy, equality before the law, property rights, religious toleration, modern secular education, sound finances, and so on—were championed, consolidated, codified and geographically extended by Napoleon. To them he added a rational and efficient local administration, an end to rural banditry, the encouragement of science and the arts, the abolition of feudalism and the greatest codification of laws since the [[fall of the Roman Empire]]".&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Roberts, ''Napoleon: A Life'' (2014), p. xxxiii.&lt;/ref&gt;

He came into conflict with Paoli, who had decided to split with France and sabotage the Corsican contribution to the ''[[Expédition de Sardaigne]]'', by preventing a French assault on the [[Kingdom of Sardinia|Sardinian]] island of [[La Maddalena]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|McLynn|1998|p=61}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bonaparte and his family fled to the French mainland in June 1793 because of the split with Paoli.&lt;ref name="rxviii"&gt;Roberts 2001, p. xviii&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Siege of Toulon ===
{{Main|Siege of Toulon}}
[[File:Napoleon à Toulon par Edouard Detaille.jpg|thumb|upright|Bonaparte at the [[Siege of Toulon]]]]

In July 1793, Bonaparte published a pro-republican pamphlet entitled ''[[Le souper de Beaucaire]]'' (Supper at [[Beaucaire, Gard|Beaucaire]]) which gained him the support of [[Augustin Robespierre]], younger brother of the Revolutionary leader [[Maximilien Robespierre]]. With the help of his fellow Corsican [[Antoine Christophe Saliceti]], Bonaparte was appointed artillery commander of the republican forces at the Siege of Toulon.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dwyer|2008|p=132}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He adopted a plan to capture a hill where republican guns could dominate the city's harbour and force the British to evacuate. The assault on the position led to the capture of the city, but during it Bonaparte was wounded in the thigh. He was promoted to [[brigadier general (France)|brigadier general]] at the age of 24. Catching the attention of the [[Committee of Public Safety]], he was put in charge of the artillery of France's [[Army of Italy (France)|Army of Italy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|McLynn|1998|p=76}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Napoleon spent time as inspector of coastal fortifications on the Mediterranean coast near [[Marseille]] while he was waiting for confirmation of the Army of Italy post. He devised plans for attacking the [[Kingdom of Sardinia]] as part of France's campaign [[War of the First Coalition|against the First Coalition]]. Augustin Robespierre and Saliceti were ready to listen to the freshly promoted artillery general.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Chandler|1973|p=30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The French army carried out Bonaparte's plan in the [[Battle of Saorgio]] in April 1794, and then advanced to seize [[Ormea]] in the mountains. From Ormea, they headed west to outflank the Austro-Sardinian positions around [[Saorge]]. After this campaign, Augustin Robespierre sent Bonaparte on a mission to the [[Republic of Genoa]] to determine that country's intentions towards France.&lt;ref&gt;Patrice Gueniffey, ''Bonaparte: 1769–1802'' (Harvard UP, 2015), pp 137–59.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 13 Vendémiaire ===
{{Main|13 Vendémiaire}}
Some contemporaries alleged that Bonaparte was put under [[house arrest]] at [[Nice]] for his association with the Robespierres following their fall in the [[Thermidorian Reaction]] in July 1794, but Napoleon's secretary [[Louis Antoine Fauvelet de Bourrienne|Bourrienne]] disputed the allegation in his memoirs. According to Bourrienne, jealousy was responsible, between the Army of the Alps and the Army of Italy (with whom Napoleon was seconded at the time).&lt;ref&gt;Bourrienne, ''Memoirs of Napoleon'', p. 39&lt;/ref&gt; Bonaparte dispatched an impassioned defense in a letter to the commissar Saliceti, and he was subsequently acquitted of any wrongdoing.&lt;ref&gt;Bourrienne, ''Memoirs of Napoleon'', p. 38&lt;/ref&gt; He was released within two weeks and, due to his technical skills, was asked to draw up plans to attack Italian positions in the context of France's war with Austria. He also took part in an expedition to take back Corsica from the British, but the French were repulsed by the British Royal Navy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dwyer|2008|p=157}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1795, Bonaparte had become engaged to [[Désirée Clary]], daughter of [[François Clary]]. Désirée's sister [[Julie Clary]] had married Bonaparte's elder brother Joseph.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|McLynn|1998|pp=76, 84}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 1795, he was assigned to the [[Army of the West (1793)|Army of the West]], which was engaged in the [[War in the Vendée]]—a civil war and royalist [[counter-revolution]] in Vendée, a region in west central France on the [[Atlantic Ocean]]. As an infantry command, it was a demotion from artillery general—for which the army already had a full quota—and he pleaded poor health to avoid the posting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|McLynn|1998|p=92}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:13Vendémiaire.jpg|thumb|alt=Etching of a street, there are many pockets of smoke due to a group of republican artillery firing on royalists across the street at the entrance to a building|''Journée du [[13 Vendémiaire]]'', artillery fire in front of the ''[[Church of Saint-Roch, Paris]]'', ''[[Rue Saint-Honoré]]'']]

He was moved to the Bureau of [[Topography]] of the Committee of Public Safety and sought unsuccessfully to be transferred to [[Constantinople]] in order to offer his services to the [[Sultan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dwyer|2008|p=26}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this period, he wrote the romantic novella ''[[Clisson et Eugénie]]'', about a soldier and his lover, in a clear parallel to Bonaparte's own relationship with Désirée.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dwyer|2008|p=164}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 15 September, Bonaparte was removed from the list of generals in regular service for his refusal to serve in the Vendée campaign. He faced a difficult financial situation and reduced career prospects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|McLynn|1998|p=93}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 3 October, royalists in Paris declared a rebellion against the [[National Convention]].&lt;ref name=m96 /&gt; [[Paul François Jean Nicolas, vicomte de Barras|Paul Barras]], a leader of the Thermidorian Reaction, knew of Bonaparte's military exploits at Toulon and gave him command of the improvised forces in defence of the Convention in the [[Tuileries Palace]]. Napoleon had seen the [[10 August (French Revolution)#Assault on the Tuileries|massacre of the King's Swiss Guard]] there three years earlier and realised that artillery would be the key to its defence.&lt;ref name="rxvi"&gt;Roberts 2001, p. xvi&lt;/ref&gt;

He ordered a young cavalry officer named [[Joachim Murat]] to seize large [[cannon]]s and used them to repel the attackers on 5 October 1795—''13 Vendémiaire An IV'' in the [[French Republican Calendar]]; 1,400 royalists died and the rest fled.&lt;ref name=m96&gt;{{Harvnb|McLynn|1998|p=96}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had cleared the streets with "a whiff of [[grapeshot]]", according to 19th-century historian [[Thomas Carlyle]] in ''[[The French Revolution: A History]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson 2002, p. 27&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qPMNAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA320#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=The works of Thomas Carlyle – The French Revolution, vol.III, book 3.VII|publisher=Google|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150320102238/https://books.google.com/books?id=qPMNAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA320#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|archivedate=20 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The defeat of the royalist insurrection extinguished the threat to the Convention and earned Bonaparte sudden fame, wealth, and the patronage of the new government, the [[French Directory|Directory]]. Murat married one of Napoleon's sisters, becoming his brother-in-law; he also served under Napoleon as one of his generals. Bonaparte was promoted to Commander of the Interior and given command of the Army of Italy.&lt;ref name="rxviii" /&gt;

Within weeks, he was romantically involved with [[Joséphine de Beauharnais]], the former mistress of Barras. The couple married on 9 March 1796 in a civil ceremony.&lt;ref&gt;Englund (2010) pp 92–94&lt;/ref&gt;

=== First Italian campaign ===
{{Main|Italian campaigns of the French Revolutionary Wars}}
[[File:1801 Antoine-Jean Gros - Bonaparte on the Bridge at Arcole.jpg|thumb|upright|left|alt=A three-quarter-length depiction of Bonaparte, with black tunic and leather gloves, holding a standard and sword, turning backwards to look at his troops|''[[Bonaparte at the Pont d'Arcole]]'', by Baron [[Antoine-Jean Gros]], ([[circa|c.]] 1801), [[Musée du Louvre]], Paris]]

Two days after the marriage, Bonaparte left Paris to take command of the Army of Italy. He immediately went on the offensive, hoping to defeat the forces of [[Kingdom of Sardinia|Piedmont]] before their Austrian allies could intervene. In a series of rapid victories during the [[Montenotte Campaign]], he knocked Piedmont out of the war in two weeks. The French then focused on the Austrians for the remainder of the war, the highlight of which became the protracted [[Siege of Mantua (1796–97)|struggle for Mantua]]. The Austrians launched a series of offensives against the French to break the siege, but Napoleon defeated every relief effort, scoring victories at the battles of [[Battle of Castiglione|Castiglione]], [[Battle of Bassano|Bassano]], [[Battle of Arcole|Arcole]], and [[Battle of Rivoli|Rivoli]]. The decisive French triumph at Rivoli in January 1797 led to the collapse of the Austrian position in Italy. At Rivoli, the Austrians lost up to 14,000 men while the French lost about 5,000.{{sfn|Bell|2015|p=29}}

The next phase of the campaign featured the French invasion of the [[House of Habsburg|Habsburg]] heartlands. French forces in Southern Germany had been defeated by the [[Archduke Charles, Duke of Teschen|Archduke Charles]] in 1796, but the Archduke withdrew his forces to protect Vienna after learning about Napoleon's assault. In the first encounter between the two commanders, Napoleon pushed back his opponent and advanced deep into Austrian territory after winning at the [[Battle of Tarvis (1797)|Battle of Tarvis]] in March 1797. The Austrians were alarmed by the French thrust that reached all the way to [[Leoben]], about 100&amp;nbsp;km from Vienna, and finally decided to sue for peace.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dwyer|2008|pp=284–85}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Treaty of Leoben]], followed by the more comprehensive [[Treaty of Campo Formio]], gave France control of most of northern Italy and the [[Low Countries]], and a secret clause promised the [[Republic of Venice]] to Austria. Bonaparte marched on Venice and forced its surrender, ending 1,100 years of independence. He also authorized the French to loot treasures such as the [[Horses of Saint Mark]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|McLynn|1998|p=132}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bonaparte reçoit les prisonniers sur le champ de bataille, 1797.jpg|thumb|Bonaparte during the Italian campaign in 1797]]
His application of conventional military ideas to real-world situations enabled his military triumphs, such as creative use of artillery as a mobile force to support his infantry. He stated later in life:{{When|date=August 2016}} "I have fought sixty battles and I have learned nothing which I did not know at the beginning. Look at Caesar; he fought the first like the last".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|McLynn|1998|p=145}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bonaparte could win battles by concealment of troop deployments and concentration of his forces on the "hinge" of an enemy's weakened front. If he could not use his favourite [[Pincer movement|envelopment strategy]], he would take up the central position and attack two co-operating forces at their hinge, swing round to fight one until it fled, then turn to face the other.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|McLynn|1998|p=142}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this Italian campaign, Bonaparte's army captured 150,000 prisoners, 540 cannons, and 170 [[flag|standards]].&lt;ref&gt;Harvey 2006, p. 179&lt;/ref&gt; The French army fought 67 actions and won 18 [[pitched battle]]s through superior artillery technology and Bonaparte's tactics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|McLynn|1998|p=135}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the campaign, Bonaparte became increasingly influential in French politics. He founded two newspapers: one for the troops in his army and another for circulation in France.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dwyer|2008|p=306}}&lt;/ref&gt; The royalists attacked Bonaparte for looting Italy and warned that he might become a dictator.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dwyer|2008|p=305}}&lt;/ref&gt; All told, Napoleon's forces extracted an estimated $45 million in funds from Italy during their campaign there, another $12 million in precious metals and jewels; atop that, his forces confiscated more than three-hundred priceless paintings and sculptures.{{sfn|Bell|2015|p=30}} Bonaparte sent General [[Pierre Augereau]] to Paris to lead a ''[[coup d'état]]'' and purge the royalists on 4 September—[[Coup of 18 Fructidor]]. This left Barras and his Republican allies in control again but dependent on Bonaparte, who proceeded to peace negotiations with Austria. These negotiations resulted in the [[Treaty of Campo Formio]], and Bonaparte returned to Paris in December as a hero.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dwyer|2008|p=322}}&lt;/ref&gt; He met [[Charles Maurice de Talleyrand-Périgord|Talleyrand]], France's new Foreign Minister—who served in the same capacity for Emperor Napoleon—and they began to prepare for an invasion of Britain.&lt;ref name="rxviii" /&gt;

=== Egyptian expedition ===
{{Main|French campaign in Egypt and Syria}}

[[File:Louis-François Baron Lejeune 001.jpg|thumb|alt=Cavalry battlescene with pyramids in background|''Battle of the Pyramids'' on 21 July 1798 by [[Louis-François, Baron Lejeune]], 1808]]

After two months of planning, Bonaparte decided that France's naval power was not yet strong enough to confront the British Royal Navy. He decided on a military expedition to seize Egypt and thereby undermine Britain's access to its [[Company rule in India#Trade|trade interests in India]].&lt;ref name="rxviii" /&gt; Bonaparte wished to establish a French presence in the Middle East, linking with [[Tipu Sultan]], a Muslim enemy of the British in India.&lt;ref name=Watson /&gt; Napoleon assured the Directory that "as soon as he had conquered Egypt, he will establish relations with the Indian princes and, together with them, attack the English in their possessions".&lt;ref name=Amini&gt;Amini 2000, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; The Directory agreed in order to secure a trade route to India.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dwyer|2008|p=342}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 1798, Bonaparte was elected a member of the [[French Academy of Sciences]]. His Egyptian expedition included a group of 167 scientists, with mathematicians, naturalists, chemists, and [[geodesy|geodesists]] among them. Their discoveries included the [[Rosetta Stone]], and their work was published in the ''[[Description de l'Égypte]]'' in 1809.&lt;ref&gt;Englund (2010) pp. 127–28&lt;/ref&gt;

En route to Egypt, Bonaparte reached [[Malta]] on 9 June 1798, then controlled by the [[Knights Hospitaller]]. Grand Master [[Ferdinand von Hompesch zu Bolheim]] surrendered after token resistance, and Bonaparte captured an important naval base with the loss of only three men.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|McLynn|1998|p=175}}&lt;/ref&gt;

General Bonaparte and his expedition eluded pursuit by the Royal Navy and landed at [[Alexandria]] on 1 July.&lt;ref name="rxviii" /&gt; He fought the [[Battle of Shubra Khit]] against the [[Mamluk]]s, Egypt's ruling military caste. This helped the French practise their defensive tactic for the [[Battle of the Pyramids]], fought on 21 July, about {{convert|24|km|0|abbr=on}} from the [[Egyptian pyramids|pyramids]]. General Bonaparte's forces of 25,000 roughly equalled those of the Mamluks' Egyptian cavalry. Twenty-nine French&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|McLynn|1998|p=179}}&lt;/ref&gt; and approximately 2,000 Egyptians were killed. The victory boosted the morale of the French army.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dwyer|2008|p=372}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 August 1798, the British fleet under [[Horatio Nelson|Sir Horatio Nelson]] captured or destroyed all but two French vessels in the [[Battle of the Nile]], defeating Bonaparte's goal to strengthen the French position in the Mediterranean.&lt;ref name="rxx"&gt;Roberts 2001, p. xx&lt;/ref&gt; His army had succeeded in a temporary increase of French power in Egypt, though it faced repeated uprisings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dwyer|2008|p=392}}&lt;/ref&gt; In early 1799, he moved an army into the [[Wilayah|Ottoman province]] of Damascus (Syria and [[Galilee]]). Bonaparte led these 13,000 French soldiers in the conquest of the coastal towns of [[Arish]], [[Gaza City|Gaza]], [[Jaffa]], and [[Haifa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dwyer|2008|pp=411–24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Siege of Jaffa|attack on Jaffa]] was particularly brutal. Bonaparte discovered that many of the defenders were former prisoners of war, ostensibly on [[Prisoners of war parole|parole]], so he ordered the garrison and 1,400 prisoners to be executed by bayonet or drowning to save bullets.&lt;ref name="rxx" /&gt; Men, women, and children were robbed and murdered for three days.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|McLynn|1998|p=189}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bonaparte began with an army of 13,000 men; 1,500 were reported missing, 1,200 died in combat, and thousands perished from disease—mostly [[bubonic plague]]. He failed to [[Siege of Acre (1799)|reduce the fortress]] of [[Acre, Israel|Acre]], so he marched his army back to Egypt in May. To speed up the retreat, Bonaparte ordered plague-stricken men to be poisoned with opium; the number who died remains disputed, ranging from a low of 30 to a high of 580. He also brought out 1,000 wounded men.&lt;ref&gt;Gueniffey, ''Bonaparte: 1769–1802'' pp. 500–02.&lt;/ref&gt; Back in Egypt on 25 July, Bonaparte defeated an [[Battle of Abukir (1799)|Ottoman amphibious invasion at Abukir]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dwyer|2008|p=442}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While in Egypt, Bonaparte stayed informed of European affairs. He learned that France had suffered a [[Campaigns of 1799 in the French Revolutionary Wars|series of defeats]] in the [[War of the Second Coalition]].&lt;ref name=egyptreturn /&gt; On 24 August 1799, he took advantage of the temporary departure of British ships from French coastal ports and set sail for France, despite the fact that he had received no explicit orders from Paris.&lt;ref name="rxx" /&gt; The army was left in the charge of [[Jean Baptiste Kléber]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dwyer|2008|p=444}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unknown to Bonaparte, the Directory had sent him orders to return to ward off possible invasions of French soil, but poor lines of communication prevented the delivery of these messages.&lt;ref name=egyptreturn&gt;Connelly 2006, p. 57&lt;/ref&gt; By the time that he reached Paris in October, France's situation had been improved by a series of victories. The Republic, however, was bankrupt and the ineffective Directory was unpopular with the French population.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dwyer|2008|p=455}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Directory discussed Bonaparte's "desertion" but was too weak to punish him.&lt;ref name=egyptreturn /&gt;

Despite the failures in Egypt, Napoleon returned to a hero's welcome. He drew together an alliance with director [[Emmanuel Joseph Sieyès]], his brother Lucien, speaker of the [[Council of Five Hundred]] [[Roger Ducos]], director [[Joseph Fouché]], and Talleyrand, and they overthrew the Directory by a [[coup d'état]] on 9 November 1799 ("the 18th Brumaire" according to the revolutionary calendar), closing down the Council of Five Hundred. Napoleon became "first consul" for ten years, with two consuls appointed by him who had consultative voices only. His power was confirmed by the new "[[Constitution of the Year VIII]]", originally devised by Sieyès to give Napoleon a minor role, but rewritten by Napoleon, and accepted by direct popular vote (3,000,000 in favor, 1,567 opposed). The constitution preserved the appearance of a republic but in reality established a dictatorship.&lt;ref&gt;François Furet, ''The French Revolution, 1770–1814'' (1996), p. 212&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Georges Lefebvre, ''Napoleon from 18 Brumaire to Tilsit 1799–1807'' (1969), pp. 60–68&lt;/ref&gt;

Napoleon established a political system that historian [[Martyn Lyons]] called "dictatorship by plebiscite".&lt;ref name="Lyons, Martyn 1994, p. 111"&gt;{{Harvnb|Lyons|1994|p=111}}&lt;/ref&gt; Worried by the democratic forces unleashed by the Revolution, but unwilling to ignore them entirely, Napoleon resorted to regular electoral consultations with the French people on his road to imperial power.&lt;ref name="Lyons, Martyn 1994, p. 111"/&gt; He drafted the [[Constitution of the Year VIII]] and secured his own election as [[First Consul]], taking up residence at the Tuileries. The constitution was approved in [[French constitutional referendum, 1800|a rigged plebiscite]] held the following January, with 99.94 percent officially listed as voting "yes".&lt;ref&gt;Lefebvre, ''Napoleon from 18 Brumaire to Tilsit 1799–1807'' (1969), pp. 71–92&lt;/ref&gt; Napoleon's brother, Lucien, had falsified the returns to show that 3 million people had participated in the plebiscite; the real number was 1.5 million.&lt;ref name="Lyons, Martyn 1994, p. 111"/&gt; Political observers at the time assumed the eligible French voting public numbered about 5 million people, so the regime artificially doubled the participation rate to indicate popular enthusiasm for the Consulate.&lt;ref name="Lyons, Martyn 1994, p. 111"/&gt; In the first few months of the Consulate, with war in Europe still raging and internal instability still plaguing the country, Napoleon's grip on power remained very tenuous.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sHoMAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA206&amp;lpg=PA206&amp;dq=August+1802+referendum+napoleon&amp;ct=result#v=onepage&amp;q=August%201802%20referendum%20napoleon&amp;f=false|title=A Brief History of Europe from 1789–1815|last=Holt|first=Lucius Hudson|last2=Chilton|first2=Alexander Wheeler|date=1919|publisher=Macmillan|language=en|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160504162817/https://books.google.com/books?id=sHoMAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA206&amp;lpg=PA206&amp;dq=August+1802+referendum+napoleon&amp;ct=result#v=onepage&amp;q=August%201802%20referendum%20napoleon&amp;f=false|archivedate=4 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the spring of 1800, Napoleon and his troops crossed the Swiss Alps into Italy, aiming to surprise the Austrian armies that had reoccupied the peninsula when Napoleon was still in Egypt.{{#tag:ref|This is depicted in ''[[Bonaparte Crossing the Alps]]'' by [[Hippolyte Delaroche]] and in Jacques-Louis David's imperial ''Napoleon Crossing the Alps''. He is less realistically portrayed on a [[Horses in warfare|charger]] in the latter work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Chandler|2002|p=51}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=note}} After a difficult crossing over the Alps, the French army entered the plains of Northern Italy virtually unopposed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Chandler|1966|pp=279–81}}&lt;/ref&gt; While one French army approached from the north, the Austrians were busy with another stationed in [[Genoa]], which was [[Siege of Genoa (1800)|besieged]] by a substantial force. The fierce resistance of this French army, under [[André Masséna]], gave the northern force some time to carry out their operations with little interference.&lt;ref name="McLynn 1998, p.235"&gt;{{Harvnb|McLynn|1998|p=235}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Jean-Simon Berthelemy (circle) Napoleon in the Battle of Maringo.jpg|thumb|left|The [[battle of Marengo]] was Napoleon's first great victory as head of state.]]

After spending several days looking for each other, the two armies collided at the [[Battle of Marengo]] on 14 June. [[Michael von Melas|General Melas]] had a numerical advantage, fielding about 30,000 Austrian soldiers while Napoleon commanded 24,000 French troops.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Chandler|1966|p=292}}&lt;/ref&gt; The battle began favorably for the Austrians as their initial attack surprised the French and gradually drove them back. Melas stated that he'd won the battle and retired to his headquarters around 3 pm, leaving his subordinates in charge of pursuing the French.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Chandler|1966|p=293}}&lt;/ref&gt; The French lines never broke during their tactical retreat; Napoleon constantly rode out among the troops urging them to stand and fight. Late in the afternoon, a full division under [[Louis Desaix|Desaix]] arrived on the field and reversed the tide of the battle. A series of artillery barrages and cavalry charges decimated the Austrian army, which fled over the [[Bormida (river)|Bormida River]] back to [[Alessandria]], leaving behind 14,000 casualties.&lt;ref name="Chandler, David 1966, p. 296"&gt;{{Harvnb|Chandler|1966|p=296}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following day, the Austrian army agreed to abandon Northern Italy once more with the Convention of Alessandria, which granted them safe passage to friendly soil in exchange for their fortresses throughout the region.&lt;ref name="Chandler, David 1966, p. 296"/&gt;

Although critics have blamed Napoleon for several tactical mistakes preceding the battle, they have also praised his audacity for selecting a risky campaign strategy, choosing to invade the Italian peninsula from the north when the vast majority of French invasions came from the west, near or along the coastline.&lt;ref name="Chandler, David 1966, pp. 298-304"&gt;{{Harvnb|Chandler|1966|pp=298–304}}&lt;/ref&gt; As Chandler points out, Napoleon spent almost a year getting the Austrians out of Italy in his first campaign; in 1800, it took him only a month to achieve the same goal.&lt;ref name="Chandler, David 1966, pp. 298-304"/&gt; German strategist and field marshal [[Alfred von Schlieffen]] concluded that "Bonaparte did not annihilate his enemy but eliminated him and rendered him harmless" while "[attaining] the object of the campaign: the conquest of North Italy".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Chandler|1966|p=301}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Napoleon's triumph at Marengo secured his political authority and boosted his popularity back home, but it did not lead to an immediate peace. Bonaparte's brother, Joseph, led the complex negotiations in [[Lunéville]] and reported that Austria, emboldened by British support, would not acknowledge the new territory that France had acquired. As negotiations became increasingly fractious, Bonaparte gave orders to his general [[Jean Victor Marie Moreau|Moreau]] to strike Austria once more. Moreau and the French swept through [[Bavaria]] and scored an overwhelming victory at [[Battle of Hohenlinden|Hohenlinden]] in December 1800. As a result, the Austrians capitulated and signed the [[Treaty of Lunéville]] in February 1801. The treaty reaffirmed and expanded earlier French gains at [[Treaty of Campo Formio|Campo Formio]].&lt;ref name="Schom 1997, p.302"&gt;{{Harvnb|Schom|1997|p=302}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{See also|Haitian Revolution}}
After a decade of constant warfare, France and Britain signed the [[Treaty of Amiens]] in March 1802, bringing the Revolutionary Wars to an end. Amiens called for the withdrawal of British troops from recently conquered colonial territories as well as for assurances to curtail the expansionary goals of the French Republic.&lt;ref name="McLynn 1998, p.235" /&gt; With Europe at peace and the economy recovering, Napoleon's popularity soared to its highest levels under the Consulate, both domestically and abroad.&lt;ref name="Lyons, Martyn 1994, pp. 111-4"&gt;{{Harvnb|Lyons|1994|pp=111–14}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a [[French constitutional referendum, 1802|new plebiscite]] during the spring of 1802, the French public came out in huge numbers to approve a constitution that made the Consulate permanent, essentially elevating Napoleon to dictator for life.&lt;ref name="Lyons, Martyn 1994, pp. 111-4"/&gt; Whereas the plebiscite two years earlier had brought out 1.5 million people to the polls, the new referendum enticed 3.6 million to go and vote (72 percent of all eligible voters).&lt;ref name="Lyons, Martyn 1994, p. 113"&gt;{{Harvnb|Lyons|1994|p=113}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was no secret ballot in 1802 and few people wanted to openly defy the regime; the constitution gained approval with over 99% of the vote.&lt;ref name="Lyons, Martyn 1994, p. 113"/&gt; His broad powers were spelled out in the new constitution: ''Article 1. The French people name, and the Senate proclaims Napoleon-Bonaparte First Consul for Life.''&lt;ref&gt;Edwards 1999, p. 55&lt;/ref&gt; After 1802, he was generally referred to as Napoleon rather than Bonaparte.&lt;ref name=m290&gt;{{Harvnb|McLynn|1998|p=290}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The brief peace in Europe allowed Napoleon to focus on the French colonies abroad. [[Saint-Domingue]] had managed to acquire a high level of political autonomy during the Revolutionary Wars, with [[Toussaint Louverture]] installing himself as de facto dictator by 1801. Napoleon saw his chance to recuperate the formerly wealthy colony when he signed the Treaty of Amiens. During the Revolution, the National Convention voted to abolish slavery in February 1794. Under the terms of Amiens, however, Napoleon agreed to appease British demands by not abolishing slavery in any colonies where the 1794 decree had never been implemented. The resulting [[Law of 20 May 1802|Law of 20 May]] never applied to colonies like [[Guadeloupe]] or [[Guyane]], even though rogue generals and other officials used the pretext of peace as an opportunity to reinstate slavery in some of these places. The Law of 20 May officially restored the slave trade to the Caribbean colonies, not slavery itself.&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, Andrew. ''Napoleon: A Life''. Penguin Group, 2014, p. 301&lt;/ref&gt; Napoleon sent [[Saint-Domingue expedition|an expedition]] under [[Charles Leclerc|General Leclerc]] designed to reassert control over Sainte-Domingue. Although the French managed to capture Toussaint Louverture, the expedition failed when high rates of disease crippled the French army. In May 1803, the last 8000 French troops left the island and the slaves proclaimed an independent republic that they called [[Haïti]] in 1804.&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, Andrew. ''Napoleon: A Life''. Penguin Group, 2014, p. 303&lt;/ref&gt; Seeing the failure of his colonial efforts, Napoleon decided in 1803 to [[Louisiana Purchase|sell]] the [[Louisiana Territory]] to the United States, instantly doubling the size of the U.S. The selling price in the [[Louisiana Purchase]] was less than three cents per acre, a total of $15 million.&lt;ref name="Roberts, Andrew 2014" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Connelly 2006, p. 70&lt;/ref&gt;

The peace with Britain proved to be uneasy and controversial.&lt;ref&gt;R.B.

Schroeder, ''The Transformation of European Politics 1763–1848'' (Oxford U.P. 1996) pp. 177–560&lt;/ref&gt; Britain did not evacuate Malta as promised and protested against Bonaparte's [[annexation]] of Piedmont and his [[Act of Mediation]], which established a new [[Swiss Confederation (Napoleonic)|Swiss Confederation]]. Neither of these territories were covered by Amiens, but they inflamed tensions significantly.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|McLynn|1998|p=265}}&lt;/ref&gt; The dispute culminated in a declaration of war by Britain in May 1803; Napoleon responded by reassembling the invasion camp at Boulogne.&lt;ref name="rxx" /&gt;

[[File:NapoleanCoronationDavid.jpg|thumb|alt=Colored painting depicting Napoleon crowning his wife inside of a cathedral |''[[The Coronation of Napoleon]]'' by [[Jacques-Louis David]] (1804)]]

During the Consulate, Napoleon faced several royalist and Jacobin [[Assassination Attempts on Napoleon Bonaparte|assassination plots]], including the ''[[Conspiration des poignards]]'' (Dagger plot) in October 1800 and the [[Plot of the Rue Saint-Nicaise]] (also known as the ''Infernal Machine'') two months later.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|McLynn|1998|p=243}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 1804, his police uncovered an assassination plot against him that involved Moreau and which was ostensibly sponsored by the [[House of Bourbon|Bourbon]] family, the former rulers of France. On the advice of Talleyrand, Napoleon ordered the kidnapping of the [[Louis Antoine, Duke of Enghien|Duke of Enghien]], violating the sovereignty of [[Baden]]. The Duke was quickly executed after a secret military trial, even though he had not been involved in the plot.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|McLynn|1998|p=296}}&lt;/ref&gt; Enghien's execution infuriated royal courts throughout Europe, becoming one of the contributing political factors for the outbreak of the Napoleonic Wars.

To expand his power, Napoleon used these [[Assassination Attempts on Napoleon Bonaparte|assassination plots]] to justify the creation of an imperial system based on the Roman model. He believed that a Bourbon restoration would be more difficult if his family's succession was entrenched in the constitution.&lt;ref name=m297&gt;{{Harvnb|McLynn|1998|p=297}}&lt;/ref&gt; Launching yet [[French constitutional referendum, 1804|another referendum]], Napoleon was elected as ''Emperor of the French'' by a tally exceeding 99%.&lt;ref name="Lyons, Martyn 1994, p. 113"/&gt; As with the Life Consulate two years earlier, this referendum produced heavy participation, bringing out almost 3.6 million voters to the polls.&lt;ref name="Lyons, Martyn 1994, p. 113"/&gt;

A keen observer of Bonaparte's rise to absolute power, [[Madame de Rémusat]], explains that "men worn out by the turmoil of the Revolution … looked for the domination of an able ruler" and that "people believed quite sincerely that Bonaparte, whether as consul or emperor, would exert his authority and save [them] from the perils of anarchy.&lt;ref&gt;De Rémusat, Claire Elisabeth, ''Memoirs of Madame De Rémusat, 1802–1808 Volume 1'', HardPress Publishing, 2012, 542 pp., {{ISBN|978-1290517478}}.&lt;/ref&gt;"
[[File:La salle du Trône (Château de Fontainebleau).jpg|thumb|Napoleon's throne room at Fontainebleau]]

Napoleon's coronation took place on 2 December 1804. Two separate crowns were brought for the ceremony: a golden laurel wreath recalling the Roman Empire and a replica of Charlemagne's crown.&lt;ref name="AndrewRoberts2"&gt;Roberts, Andrew. ''Napoleon: A Life''. Penguin Group, 2014, p. 355.&lt;/ref&gt; Napoleon entered the ceremony wearing the laurel wreath and kept it on his head throughout the proceedings.&lt;ref name="AndrewRoberts2"/&gt; For the official coronation, he raised the Charlemagne crown over his own head in a symbolic gesture, but never placed it on top because he was already wearing the golden wreath.&lt;ref name="AndrewRoberts2"/&gt; Instead he placed the crown on Josephine's head, the event commemorated in the officially sanctioned painting by [[Jacques-Louis David]].&lt;ref name="AndrewRoberts2"/&gt; Napoleon was also crowned [[King of Italy]], with the [[Iron Crown of Lombardy]], at the [[Milan Cathedral|Cathedral of Milan]] on 26 May 1805. He created eighteen [[Marshal of France|Marshals of the Empire]] from among his top generals to secure the allegiance of the army on 18 May 1804, the official start of the Empire.

The decisive finale of the [[Ulm Campaign]] raised the tally of captured Austrian soldiers to 60,000. With the Austrian army destroyed, [[Vienna]] would fall to the French in November.]]

Great Britain had broken the Peace of Amiens by declaring war on France in May 1803.&lt;ref&gt;Paul W. Schroeder, ''The Transformation of European Politics 1763–1848'' (1996) pp. 231–86&lt;/ref&gt; In December 1804, an Anglo-Swedish agreement became the first step towards the creation of the Third Coalition. By April 1805, Britain had also signed an alliance with Russia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Chandler|1966|p=328}}. Meanwhile, French territorial rearrangements in Germany occurred without Russian consultation and Napoleon's annexations in the [[Po River|Po valley]] increasingly strained relations between the two.&lt;/ref&gt; Austria had been defeated by France twice in recent memory and wanted revenge, so it joined the coalition a few months later.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Chandler|1966|p=331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the formation of the Third Coalition, Napoleon had assembled an invasion force, the ''Armée d'Angleterre'', around six camps at [[Boulogne-sur-Mer|Boulogne]] in Northern France. He intended to use this invasion force to strike at England. They never invaded, but Napoleon's troops received careful and invaluable training for future military operations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Chandler|1966|p=323}}&lt;/ref&gt; The men at Boulogne formed the core for what Napoleon later called ''La Grande Armée''. At the start, this French army had about 200,000 men organized into seven [[corps]], which were large field units that contained 36–40 [[cannon]]s each and were capable of independent action until other corps could come to the rescue.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Chandler|1966|p=332}}&lt;/ref&gt; A single corps properly situated in a strong defensive position could survive at least a day without support, giving the ''Grande Armée'' countless strategic and tactical options on every campaign. On top of these forces, Napoleon created a [[cavalry]] reserve of 22,000 organized into two [[cuirassier]] [[Division (military)|divisions]], four mounted [[dragoon]] divisions, one division of dismounted dragoons, and one of light cavalry, all supported by 24 [[artillery]] pieces.&lt;ref name="Chandler p. 333"&gt;{{Harvnb|Chandler|1966|p=333}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1805, the ''Grande Armée'' had grown to a force of 350,000 men,&lt;ref name="Chandler p. 333" /&gt; who were well equipped, well trained, and led by competent officers.&lt;ref&gt;Michael J. Hughes, ''Forging Napoleon's Grande Armée: Motivation, Military Culture, and Masculinity in the French Army, 1800–1808'' (NYU Press, 2012).&lt;/ref&gt;

Napoleon knew that the French fleet could not defeat the Royal Navy in a head-to-head battle, so he planned to lure it away from the English Channel through diversionary tactics.&lt;ref name="McLynn 1998, p.321"&gt;{{Harvnb|McLynn|1998|p=321}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main strategic idea involved the [[French Navy]] escaping from the British blockades of [[Toulon]] and [[Brest, France|Brest]] and threatening to attack the West Indies. In the face of this attack, it was hoped, the British would weaken their defense of the [[Western Approaches]] by sending ships to the Caribbean, allowing a combined Franco-Spanish fleet to take control of the channel long enough for French armies to cross and [[Napoleon's planned invasion of the United Kingdom|invade]].&lt;ref name="McLynn 1998, p.321" /&gt; However, the plan unraveled after the British victory at the [[Battle of Cape Finisterre (1805)|Battle of Cape Finisterre]] in July 1805. French [[Pierre-Charles Villeneuve|Admiral Villeneuve]] then retreated to [[Cádiz]] instead of linking up with French naval forces at Brest for an attack on the [[English Channel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|McLynn|1998|p=332}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By August 1805, Napoleon had realised that the strategic situation had changed fundamentally. Facing a potential invasion from his continental enemies, he decided to strike first and turned his army's sights from the English Channel to the [[Rhine]]. His basic objective was to destroy the isolated Austrian armies in Southern Germany before their Russian allies could arrive. On 25 September, after great secrecy and feverish marching, 200,000 French troops began to cross the Rhine on a front of {{convert|260|km|mi|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Brooks (editor), ''Atlas of World Military History''. p. 108&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Uffindell, ''Great Generals of the Napoleonic Wars''. p. 15&lt;/ref&gt; Austrian commander [[Karl Mack]] had gathered the greater part of the Austrian army at the fortress of [[Ulm]] in [[Swabia]]. Napoleon swung his forces to the southeast and the ''Grande Armée'' performed an elaborate wheeling movement that outflanked the Austrian positions. The [[Ulm Campaign|Ulm Maneuver]] completely surprised General Mack, who belatedly understood that his army had been cut off. After some minor engagements that culminated in the [[Battle of Ulm]], Mack finally surrendered after realising that there was no way to break out of the French encirclement. For just 2,000 French casualties, Napoleon had managed to capture a total of 60,000 Austrian soldiers through his army's rapid marching.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Brooks (editor), ''Atlas of World Military History''. p. 156.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Ulm Campaign]] is generally regarded as a strategic masterpiece and was influential in the development of the [[Schlieffen Plan]] in the late 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Brooks (editor), ''Atlas of World Military History''. p. 156. "It is a historical cliché to compare the Schlieffen Plan with [[Hannibal]]'s tactical envelopment at [[Battle of Cannae|Cannae]] (216 BC); Schlieffen owed more to Napoleon's strategic maneuver on Ulm (1805)".&lt;/ref&gt; For the French, this spectacular victory on land was soured by the decisive victory that the Royal Navy attained at the [[Battle of Trafalgar]] on 21 October. After Trafalgar, Britain had total domination of the seas for the duration of the Napoleonic Wars.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}
[[File:Austerlitz-baron-Pascal.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|Napoleon at the Battle of Austerlitz, by [[François Gérard]] 1805. The [[Battle of Austerlitz]], also known as the Battle of the Three Emperors, was one of Napoleon's many victories, where the [[First French Empire|French Empire]] defeated the [[Third Coalition]].]]
Following the Ulm Campaign, French forces managed to capture [[Vienna]] in November. The fall of Vienna provided the French a huge bounty as they captured 100,000 muskets, 500 cannons, and the intact bridges across the [[Danube River|Danube]].&lt;ref&gt;David G. Chandler, ''The Campaigns of Napoleon''. p. 407&lt;/ref&gt; At this critical juncture, both [[Alexander I of Russia|Tsar Alexander I]] and [[Francis II, Holy Roman Emperor|Holy Roman Emperor Francis II]] decided to engage Napoleon in battle, despite reservations from some of their subordinates. Napoleon sent his army north in pursuit of the Allies, but then ordered his forces to retreat so that he could feign a grave weakness. Desperate to lure the Allies into battle, Napoleon gave every indication in the days preceding the engagement that the French army was in a pitiful state, even abandoning the dominant Pratzen Heights near the village of Austerlitz. At the [[Battle of Austerlitz]], in [[Moravia]] on 2 December, he deployed the French army below the Pratzen Heights and deliberately weakened his right flank, enticing the Allies to launch a major assault there in the hopes of rolling up the whole French line. A forced march from Vienna by [[Louis-Nicolas Davout|Marshal Davout]] and his [[III Corps (Grande Armée)|III Corps]] plugged the gap left by Napoleon just in time. Meanwhile, the heavy Allied deployment against the French right weakened their center on the Pratzen Heights, which was viciously attacked by the [[IV Corps (Grande Armée)|IV Corps]] of [[Jean-de-Dieu Soult|Marshal Soult]]. With the Allied center demolished, the French swept through both enemy flanks and sent the Allies fleeing chaotically, capturing thousands of prisoners in the process. The battle is often seen as a tactical masterpiece because of the near-perfect execution of a calibrated but dangerous plan – of the same stature as [[Battle of Cannae|Cannae]], the celebrated triumph by [[Hannibal]] some 2,000 years before.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Adrian Gilbert|title=The Encyclopedia of Warfare: From Earliest Time to the Present Day|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MZoO7SIwMVIC&amp;pg=PA133|accessdate=11 July 2014|year=2000|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-1-57958-216-6|page=133|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140729052159/http://books.google.com/books?id=MZoO7SIwMVIC&amp;pg=PA133|archivedate=29 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Allied disaster at Austerlitz significantly shook the faith of Emperor Francis in the British-led war effort. France and Austria agreed to an armistice immediately and the Treaty of Pressburg followed shortly after on 26 December. Pressburg took Austria out of both the war and the Coalition while reinforcing the earlier treaties of [[Treaty of Campo Formio|Campo Formio]] and of [[Treaty of Lunéville|Lunéville]] between the two powers. The treaty confirmed the Austrian loss of lands to France in [[Kingdom of Italy (Napoleonic)|Italy]] and [[Electorate of Bavaria|Bavaria]], and lands in Germany to Napoleon's German allies. It also imposed an indemnity of 40 million francs on the defeated Habsburgs and allowed the fleeing Russian troops free passage through hostile territories and back to their home soil. Napoleon went on to say, "The battle of Austerlitz is the finest of all I have fought".&lt;ref&gt;Schom 1997, p. 414&lt;/ref&gt; Frank McLynn suggests that Napoleon was so successful at Austerlitz that he lost touch with reality, and what used to be French foreign policy became a "personal Napoleonic one".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|McLynn|1998|p=350}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Vincent Cronin]] disagrees, stating that Napoleon was not overly ambitious for himself, "he embodied the ambitions of thirty million Frenchmen".&lt;ref&gt;Cronin 1994, p. 344&lt;/ref&gt;

Napoleon continued to entertain a grand scheme to establish a French presence in the Middle East in order to put pressure on Britain and Russia, and perhaps form an alliance with the Ottoman Empire.&lt;ref name=Watson&gt;Watson 2003, pp. 13–14&lt;/ref&gt; In February 1806, Ottoman Emperor [[Selim III]] finally recognised Napoleon as ''Emperor''. He also opted for an alliance with France, calling France "our sincere and natural ally".&lt;ref&gt;Karsh 2001, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; That decision brought the Ottoman Empire into a losing war against Russia and Britain. A Franco-Persian alliance was also formed between Napoleon and the [[Qajar dynasty|Persian Empire]] of [[Fat′h-Ali Shah Qajar]]. It collapsed in 1807, when France and Russia themselves formed an unexpected alliance.&lt;ref name=Watson /&gt; In the end, Napoleon had made no effective alliances in the Middle East.{{sfn|Sicker|2001|p=99}}

==== War of the Fourth Coalition and Tilsit ====
{{Main|War of the Fourth Coalition}}
After Austerlitz, Napoleon established the [[Confederation of the Rhine]] in 1806. A collection of German states intended to serve as a buffer zone between France and Central Europe, the creation of the Confederation spelled the end of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] and significantly alarmed the Prussians. The brazen reorganization of German territory by the French risked threatening Prussian influence in the region, if not eliminating it outright. War fever in Berlin rose steadily throughout the summer of 1806. At the insistence of his court, especially his wife [[Louise of Mecklenburg-Strelitz|Queen Louise]], [[Frederick William III of Prussia|Frederick William III]] decided to challenge the French domination of Central Europe by going to war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Michael V.

[[File:Iena.jpg|thumb|Napoleon reviews the [[French Imperial Guard|Imperial Guard]] before the [[Battle of Jena]].]]

The initial military maneuvers began in September 1806. In a letter to [[Jean-de-Dieu Soult|Marshal Soult]] detailing the plan for the campaign, Napoleon described the essential features of Napoleonic warfare and introduced the phrase ''le bataillon-carré'' ("square battalion").&lt;ref name="Chandler 1966, p. 467-8"&gt;Chandler 1966, pp. 467–68&lt;/ref&gt; In the ''bataillon-carré'' system, the various corps of the ''Grande Armée'' would march uniformly together in close supporting distance.&lt;ref name="Chandler 1966, p. 467-8" /&gt; If any single corps was attacked, the others could quickly spring into action and arrive to help. Napoleon invaded Prussia with 180,000 troops, rapidly marching on the right bank of the [[Saale|River Saale]]. As in previous campaigns, his fundamental objective was to destroy one opponent before reinforcements from another could tip the balance of the war. Upon learning the whereabouts of the Prussian army, the French swung westwards and crossed the Saale with overwhelming force. At the twin [[Battle of Jena–Auerstedt|battles of Jena and Auerstedt]], fought on 14 October, the French convincingly defeated the Prussians and inflicted heavy casualties. With several major commanders dead or incapacitated, the Prussian king proved incapable of effectively commanding the army, which began to quickly disintegrate. In a vaunted pursuit that epitomized the "peak of Napoleonic warfare", according to historian Richard Brooks,&lt;ref&gt;Brooks 2000, p. 110&lt;/ref&gt; the French managed to capture 140,000 soldiers, over 2,000 cannons and hundreds of ammunition wagons, all in a single month. Historian David Chandler wrote of the Prussian forces: "Never has the morale of any army been more completely shattered".&lt;ref name="Chandler 1966, p. 467-8" /&gt; Despite their overwhelming defeat, the Prussians refused to negotiate with the French until the Russians had an opportunity to enter the fight.

[[File:Tilsitz 1807.JPG|thumb|left|The [[Treaties of Tilsit]]: Napoleon meeting with [[Alexander I of Russia]] on a raft in the middle of the [[Neman River]]]]

Following his triumph, Napoleon imposed the first elements of the Continental System through the [[Berlin Decree]] issued in November 1806. The Continental System, which prohibited European nations from trading with Britain, was widely violated throughout his reign.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|McLynn|1998|p=497}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Godechot et al. ''Napoleonic Era in Europe'' (1971) pp. 126–39&lt;/ref&gt; In the next few months, Napoleon marched against the advancing Russian armies through Poland and was involved in the bloody stalemate at the [[Battle of Eylau]] in February 1807.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|McLynn|1998|p=370}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a period of rest and consolidation on both sides, the war restarted in June with an initial struggle at [[Battle of Heilsberg|Heilsberg]] that proved indecisive. On 14 June, however, Napoleon finally obtained an overwhelming victory over the Russians at the [[Battle of Friedland]], wiping out the majority of the Russian army in a very bloody struggle. The scale of their defeat convinced the Russians to make peace with the French. On 19 June, Czar Alexander sent an envoy to seek an armistice with Napoleon. The latter assured the envoy that the [[Vistula River]] represented the natural borders between French and Russian influence in Europe. On that basis, the two emperors began peace negotiations at the town of [[Sovetsk, Kaliningrad Oblast|Tilsit]] after meeting on an iconic raft on the [[Neman (river)|River Niemen]]. The very first thing Alexander said to Napoleon was probably well-calibrated: "I hate the English as much as you do".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=August Fournier|title=Napoleon I.: A Biography|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jZ8fAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA459|year=1911|page=459|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161118001638/https://books.google.com/books?id=jZ8fAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA459|archivedate=18 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alexander faced pressure from his brother, [[Grand Duke Constantine Pavlovich of Russia|Duke Constantine]], to make peace with Napoleon. Given the victory he had just achieved, the French emperor offered the Russians relatively lenient terms – demanding that Russia join the Continental System, withdraw its forces from [[Wallachia]] and [[Moldavia]], and hand over the [[Ionian Islands]] to France.{{sfn|Roberts|2014|pages=458–59}} By contrast, Napoleon dictated very harsh peace terms for Prussia, despite the ceaseless exhortations of [[Louise of Mecklenburg-Strelitz|Queen Louise]]. Wiping out half of Prussian territories from the map, Napoleon created a new kingdom of 1,100 square miles called [[Kingdom of Westphalia|Westphalia]] and appointed his young brother Jérôme as its monarch. Prussia's humiliating treatment at Tilsit caused a deep and bitter antagonism which festered as the [[Napoleonic era]] progressed. Moreover, Alexander's pretensions at friendship with Napoleon led the latter to seriously misjudge the true intentions of his Russian counterpart, who would violate numerous provisions of the treaty in the next few years. Despite these problems, the [[Treaties of Tilsit]] at last gave Napoleon a respite from war and allowed him to return to France, which he had not seen in over 300 days.{{sfn|Roberts|2014|pages=459–61}}

==== Peninsular War and Erfurt ====
{{Main|Peninsular War}}
The settlements at Tilsit gave Napoleon time to organize his empire. One of his major objectives became enforcing the Continental System against the British. He decided to focus his attention on the [[Kingdom of Portugal]], which consistently violated his trade prohibitions. After defeat in the [[War of the Oranges]] in 1801, Portugal adopted a double-sided policy. At first, [[John VI of Portugal|John VI]] agreed to close his ports to British trade. The situation changed dramatically after the Franco-Spanish defeat at Trafalgar; John grew bolder and officially resumed diplomatic and trade relations with Britain.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

Unhappy with this change of policy by the Portuguese government, Napoleon negotiated a [[Treaty of Fontainebleau (1807)|secret treaty]] with [[Charles IV of Spain]] and sent an army to invade Portugal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Horne |first=Alistair |author-link=Alistair Horne |title=How Far From Austerlitz?

Throughout the winter of 1808, French agents became increasingly involved in Spanish internal affairs, attempting to incite discord between members of the [[House of Bourbon|Spanish royal family]]. On 16 February 1808, secret French machinations finally materialized when Napoleon announced that he would intervene to mediate between the rival political factions in the country.&lt;ref&gt;Fisher &amp; Fremont-Barnes pp. 198–99.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Joachim Murat|Marshal Murat]] led 120,000 troops into Spain and the French arrived in [[Madrid]] on 24 March,&lt;ref&gt;Fisher &amp; Fremont-Barnes p. 199.&lt;/ref&gt; where wild riots against the occupation erupted just a few weeks later. Napoleon appointed his brother, [[Joseph Bonaparte]], as the new King of Spain in the summer of 1808. The appointment enraged a heavily religious and conservative Spanish population. Resistance to French aggression soon spread throughout the country. The shocking French defeat at the [[Battle of Bailén]] in July gave hope to Napoleon's enemies and partly persuaded the French emperor to intervene in person.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

Before going to Iberia, Napoleon decided to address several lingering issues with the Russians. At the [[Congress of Erfurt]] in October 1808, Napoleon hoped to keep Russia on his side during the upcoming struggle in Spain and during any potential conflict against Austria. The two sides reached an agreement, the Erfurt Convention, that called upon Britain to cease its war against France, that recognized the Russian conquest of [[Grand Duchy of Finland|Finland]] from [[Kingdom of Sweden (1721–1809)|Sweden]], and that affirmed Russian support for France in a possible war against Austria "to the best of its ability".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.napoleon-series.org/research/government/diplomatic/c_erfurt.html |title=The Erfurt Convention 1808 |publisher=Napoleon-series.org |accessdate=22 April 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131021094131/http://www.napoleon-series.org/research/government/diplomatic/c_erfurt.html |archivedate=21 October 2013  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Napoleon then returned to France and prepared for war. The ''Grande Armée'', under the Emperor's personal command, rapidly crossed the [[Ebro]] River in November 1808 and inflicted a series of crushing defeats against the Spanish forces. After clearing the last Spanish force guarding the capital at [[Battle of Somosierra|Somosierra]], Napoleon entered Madrid on 4 December with 80,000 troops.&lt;ref&gt;Fisher &amp; Fremont-Barnes p. 205.&lt;/ref&gt; He then unleashed his soldiers against [[John Moore (British soldier)|Moore]] and the British forces. The British were swiftly driven to the coast, and they withdrew from Spain entirely after a last stand at the [[Battle of Corunna]] in January 1809.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

[[File:Antoine-Jean Gros - Capitulation de Madrid, le 4 décembre 1808.jpg|thumb|left|Napoleon accepts the surrender of [[Madrid]], 4 December 1808]]

Napoleon would end up leaving Iberia in order to deal with the Austrians in Central Europe, but the Peninsular War continued on long after his absence. He never returned to Spain after the 1808 campaign. Several months after Corunna, the British sent another army to the peninsula under the future [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Duke of Wellington]]. The war then settled into a complex and asymmetric strategic deadlock where all sides struggled to gain the upper hand. The highlight of the conflict became the brutal ''[[guerrilla warfare]]'' that engulfed much of the Spanish countryside. Both sides committed the worst atrocities of the Napoleonic Wars during this phase of the conflict. The vicious guerrilla fighting in Spain, largely absent from the French campaigns in Central Europe, severely disrupted the French lines of supply and communication. Although France maintained roughly 300,000 troops in Iberia during the Peninsular War, the vast majority were tied down to garrison duty and to intelligence operations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Chandler|1966|pp=659–60}}&lt;/ref&gt; The French were never able to concentrate all of their forces effectively, prolonging the war until events elsewhere in Europe finally turned the tide in favor of the Allies. After the invasion of Russia in 1812, the number of French troops in Spain vastly declined as Napoleon needed reinforcements to conserve his strategic position in Europe. By 1814, after scores of battles and sieges throughout Iberia, the Allies had managed to push the French out of the peninsula.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

The impact of the Napoleonic invasion of Spain and ousting of the Spanish Bourbon monarchy in favor of his brother Joseph had an enormous impact on the [[Spanish empire]]. In [[Hispanic America|Spanish America]] many local elites formed juntas and set up mechanisms to rule in the name of [[Ferdinand VII of Spain]], whom they considered the legitimate Spanish monarch. The outbreak of the [[Spanish American wars of independence]] in most of the empire was a result of Napoleon's destabilizing actions in Spain and led to the rise of [[Strongman (politics)|strongmen]] in the wake of these wars.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Lynch (historian)|John Lynch]],  ''Caudillos in Spanish America 1800–1850''. Oxford: Clarendon Press 1992, pp. 402–03.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Napoleon Wagram.jpg|thumb|Napoleon at the [[Battle of Wagram]], painted by [[Horace Vernet]]]]

After four years on the sidelines, Austria sought another war with France to avenge its recent defeats. Austria could not count on Russian support because the latter was at war with [[Anglo-Russian War (1807–1812)|Britain]], [[Finnish War|Sweden]], and the [[Russo-Turkish War (1806–1812)|Ottoman Empire]] in 1809. [[Frederick William III of Prussia|Frederick William]] of Prussia initially promised to help the Austrians, but reneged before conflict began.&lt;ref name="Fisher &amp; Fremont-Barnes p. 106"&gt;Fisher &amp; Fremont-Barnes, p. 106.&lt;/ref&gt; A report from the Austrian finance minister suggested that the treasury would run out of money by the middle of 1809 if the large army that the Austrians had formed since the Third Coalition remained mobilized.&lt;ref name="Fisher &amp; Fremont-Barnes p. 106" /&gt; Although [[Archduke Charles, Duke of Teschen|Archduke Charles]] warned that the Austrians were not ready for another showdown with Napoleon, a stance that landed him in the so-called "peace party", he did not want to see the army demobilized either.&lt;ref name="Fisher &amp; Fremont-Barnes p. 106" /&gt; On 8 February 1809, the advocates for war finally succeeded when the Imperial Government secretly decided on another confrontation against the French.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

In the early morning of 10 April, leading elements of the Austrian army crossed the [[Inn River]] and invaded Bavaria. The early Austrian attack surprised the French; Napoleon himself was still in Paris when he heard about the invasion. He arrived at [[Donauwörth]] on the 17th to find the ''Grande Armée'' in a dangerous position, with its two wings separated by {{convert|75|mi|km}} and joined together by a thin cordon of Bavarian troops. Charles pressed the left wing of the French army and hurled his men towards the III Corps of Marshal Davout. In response, Napoleon came up with a plan to cut off the Austrians in the celebrated ''Landshut Maneuver''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Chandler|1966|p=690}}&lt;/ref&gt; He realigned the axis of his army and marched his soldiers towards the town of [[Eckmühl]]. The French scored a convincing win in the resulting [[Battle of Eckmühl]], forcing Charles to withdraw his forces over the [[Danube]] and into [[Bohemia]]. On 13 May, Vienna fell for the second time in four years, although the war continued since most of the Austrian army had survived the initial engagements in Southern Germany.

[[File:Wigand-Entry of Napoleon in Schönbrunn.jpg|thumb|left|The entry of Bonaparte in [[Schönbrunn Palace|Schönbrunn]], Vienna]]

By 17 May, the main Austrian army under Charles had arrived on the Marchfeld. Charles kept the bulk of his troops several miles away from the river bank in hopes of concentrating them at the point where Napoleon decided to cross. On 21 May, the French made their first major effort to cross the Danube, precipitating the [[Battle of Aspern-Essling]]. The Austrians enjoyed a comfortable numerical superiority over the French throughout the battle; on the first day, Charles disposed of 110,000 soldiers against only 31,000 commanded by Napoleon.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Chandler|1966|p=701}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the second day, reinforcements had boosted French numbers up to 70,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Chandler|1966|p=705}}&lt;/ref&gt; The battle was characterized by a vicious back-and-forth struggle for the two villages of Aspern and Essling, the focal points of the French bridgehead. By the end of the fighting, the French had lost Aspern but still controlled Essling. A sustained Austrian artillery bombardment eventually convinced Napoleon to withdraw his forces back onto Lobau Island. Both sides inflicted about 23,000 casualties on each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Chandler|1966|p=706}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the first defeat Napoleon suffered in a major set-piece battle, and it caused excitement throughout many parts of Europe because it proved that he could be beaten on the battlefield.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Chandler|1966|p=707}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the setback at Aspern-Essling, Napoleon took more than six weeks in planning and preparing for contingencies before he made another attempt at crossing the Danube.&lt;ref name="David G. Chandler p. 708"&gt;David G. Chandler, ''The Campaigns of Napoleon''. p. 708&lt;/ref&gt; From 30 June to the early days of July, the French recrossed the Danube in strength, with more than 180,000 troops marching across the Marchfeld towards the Austrians.&lt;ref name="David G. Chandler p. 708" /&gt; Charles received the French with 150,000 of his own men.&lt;ref&gt;David G. Chandler, ''The Campaigns of Napoleon''. p. 720&lt;/ref&gt; In the ensuing [[Battle of Wagram]], which also lasted two days, Napoleon commanded his forces in what was the largest battle of his career up until then. Napoleon finished off the battle with a concentrated central thrust that punctured a hole in the Austrian army and forced Charles to retreat. Austrian losses were very heavy, reaching well over 40,000 casualties.&lt;ref&gt;David G. Chandler, ''The Campaigns of Napoleon''. p. 729&lt;/ref&gt; The French were too exhausted to pursue the Austrians immediately, but Napoleon eventually caught up with Charles at [[Znojmo|Znaim]] and the latter signed an [[Armistice of Znaim|armistice]] on 12 July.

In the [[Kingdom of Holland]], the British launched the [[Walcheren Campaign]] to open up a second front in the war and to relieve the pressure on the Austrians. The British army only landed at [[Walcheren]] on 30 July, by which point the Austrians had already been defeated. The Walcheren Campaign was characterized by little fighting but heavy casualties thanks to the popularly dubbed "[[Walcheren Fever]]". Over 4000 British troops were lost in a bungled campaign, and the rest withdrew in December 1809.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.napoleon-series.org/military/battles/c_walcheren.html|title=The British Expeditionary Force to Walcheren: 1809|publisher=napoleon-series.org|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718144402/http://www.napoleon-series.org/military/battles/c_walcheren.html|archivedate=18 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main strategic result from the campaign became the delayed political settlement between the French and the Austrians. Emperor Francis wanted to wait and see how the British performed in their theater before entering into negotiations with Napoleon. Once it became apparent that the British were going nowhere, the Austrians agreed to peace talks.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

The resulting [[Treaty of Schönbrunn]] in October 1809 was the harshest that France had imposed on Austria in recent memory. [[Klemens Wenzel von Metternich|Metternich]] and Archduke Charles had the preservation of the [[Habsburg Empire]] as their fundamental goal, and to this end they succeeded by making Napoleon seek more modest goals in return for promises of friendship between the two powers.&lt;ref name="Todd Fisher p. 144"&gt;Todd Fisher &amp; Gregory Fremont-Barnes, ''The Napoleonic Wars: The Rise and Fall of an Empire''. p. 144.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, while most of the hereditary lands remained a part of the Habsburg realm, France received [[Carinthia (province)|Carinthia]], [[Carniola]], and the [[Adriatic Sea|Adriatic]] ports, while [[Galicia (Central Europe)|Galicia]] was given to the [[Duchy of Warsaw|Poles]] and the [[Salzburg]] area of the [[County of Tyrol|Tyrol]] went to the [[Kingdom of Bavaria|Bavarians]].&lt;ref name="Todd Fisher p. 144" /&gt; Austria lost over three million subjects, about one-fifth of her total population, as a result of these territorial changes.&lt;ref&gt;David G. Chandler, ''The Campaigns of Napoleon''. p. 732.&lt;/ref&gt; Although fighting in Iberia continued, the War of the Fifth Coalition would be the last major conflict on the European continent for the next three years.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

Napoleon turned his focus to domestic affairs after the war. [[Joséphine de Beauharnais|Empress Joséphine]] had still not given birth to a child from Napoleon, who became worried about the future of his empire following his death. Desperate for a legitimate heir, Napoleon divorced Joséphine on 10 January 1810 and started looking for a new wife. Hoping to cement the recent alliance with Austria through a family connection, Napoleon married the [[Marie Louise, Duchess of Parma|Archduchess Marie Louise]], who was 18 years old at the time. On 20 March 1811, Marie Louise gave birth to a baby boy, whom Napoleon made heir apparent and bestowed the title of ''[[King of the Romans|King of Rome]]''. His son never actually ruled the empire, but historians still refer to him as ''[[Napoleon II]]''.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

==== Invasion of Russia ====
{{Main|French invasion of Russia}}
[[File:Portrait of Napoleon le Grand (4674756).jpg|thumb|Engraving of 'Napoleon le Grand', ca 1810 from a portrait by 
Noël François Bertrand]]
In 1808, Napoleon and Czar Alexander met at the [[Congress of Erfurt]] to preserve the Russo-French alliance. The leaders had a friendly personal relationship after their first meeting at Tilsit in 1807.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|McLynn|1998|p=378}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1811, however, tensions had increased and Alexander was under pressure from the [[Russian nobility]] to break off the alliance. A major strain on the relationship between the two nations became the regular violations of the Continental System by the Russians, which led Napoleon to threaten Alexander with serious consequences if he formed an alliance with Britain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|McLynn|1998|p=495}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Napoleon Moscow Fire.JPG|thumb|The [[Fire of Moscow (1812)|Moscow fire]] depicted by an unknown German artist]]
[[File:Napoleons retreat from moscow.jpg|thumb|''Napoleon's withdrawal from Russia'', painting by [[Adolph Northen]]]]

By 1812, advisers to Alexander suggested the possibility of an invasion of the French Empire and the recapture of Poland. On receipt of intelligence reports on Russia's war preparations, Napoleon expanded his ''Grande Armée'' to more than 450,000 men.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|McLynn|1998|p=507}}&lt;/ref&gt; He ignored repeated advice against an invasion of the Russian heartland and prepared for an offensive campaign; on 24 June 1812 the invasion commenced.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|McLynn|1998|p=506}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an attempt to gain increased support from Polish nationalists and patriots, Napoleon termed the war the ''Second Polish War''—the ''First Polish War'' had been the [[Bar Confederation]] uprising by Polish nobles against Russia in 1768. Polish patriots wanted the Russian part of Poland to be joined with the Duchy of Warsaw and an independent Poland created. This was rejected by Napoleon, who stated he had promised his ally Austria this would not happen. Napoleon refused to [[manumission|manumit]] the Russian [[serf]]s because of concerns this might provoke a reaction in his army's rear. The serfs later committed atrocities against French soldiers during France's retreat.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|McLynn|1998|pp=504–505}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Russians avoided Napoleon's objective of a decisive engagement and instead retreated deeper into Russia. A brief attempt at resistance was made at [[Battle of Smolensk (1812)|Smolensk]] in August; the Russians were defeated in a series of battles, and Napoleon resumed his advance. The Russians again avoided battle, although in a few cases this was only achieved because Napoleon uncharacteristically hesitated to attack when the opportunity arose. Owing to the Russian army's [[scorched earth]] tactics, the French found it increasingly difficult to forage food for themselves and their horses.&lt;ref&gt;Harvey 2006, p.773&lt;/ref&gt;

The Russians eventually offered battle outside Moscow on 7 September: the [[Battle of Borodino]] resulted in approximately 44,000 Russian and 35,000 French dead, wounded or captured, and may have been the bloodiest day of battle in history up to that point in time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|McLynn|1998|p=518}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the French had won, the Russian army had accepted, and withstood, the major battle Napoleon had hoped would be decisive. Napoleon's own account was: "The most terrible of all my battles was the one before Moscow. The French showed themselves to be worthy of victory, but the Russians showed themselves worthy of being invincible".&lt;ref&gt;Markham 1988, p. 194&lt;/ref&gt;

The Russian army withdrew and retreated past Moscow. Napoleon entered the city, assuming its fall would end the war and Alexander would negotiate peace. However, on orders of the city's governor [[Feodor Rostopchin]], rather than capitulation, Moscow was burned. After five weeks, Napoleon and his army left. In early November Napoleon got concerned about loss of control back in France after the [[Malet coup of 1812]]. His army walked through snow up to their knees, and nearly 10,000 men and horses froze to death on the night of 8/9 November alone. After the [[Battle of Berezina]] Napoleon managed to escape but had to abandon much of the remaining artillery and baggage train. On 5 December, shortly before arriving in Vilnius, Napoleon left the army in a sledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.napoleon-1812.nl/english.php|title=Napoleon1812|work=napoleon-1812.nl|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160213205204/http://napoleon-1812.nl/english.php|archivedate=13 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The French suffered in the course of a ruinous retreat, including from the harshness of the [[Russian Winter]]. The Armée had begun as over 400,000 frontline troops, with fewer than 40,000 crossing the [[Berezina River]] in November 1812.&lt;ref&gt;Markham 1988, pp. 190, 199&lt;/ref&gt; The Russians had lost 150,000 in battle and hundreds of thousands of civilians.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|McLynn|1998|p=541}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== War of the Sixth Coalition ====
{{Main|War of the Sixth Coalition}}
[[File:Montfort - Adieux de Napoleon a la Garde imperiale.jpg|thumb|Napoleon's farewell to his Imperial Guard, 20 April 1814]]

There was a lull in fighting over the winter of 1812–13 while both the Russians and the French rebuilt their forces; Napoleon was able to field 350,000 troops.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|McLynn|1998|p=549}}&lt;/ref&gt; Heartened by France's loss in Russia, Prussia joined with Austria, Sweden, Russia, Great Britain, Spain, and Portugal in a new coalition. Napoleon assumed command in Germany and inflicted a series of defeats on the Coalition culminating in the [[Battle of Dresden]] in August 1813.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|McLynn|1998|p=565}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite these successes, the numbers continued to mount against Napoleon, and the French army was pinned down by a force twice its size and lost at the [[Battle of Leipzig]]. This was by far the largest battle of the Napoleonic Wars and cost more than 90,000 casualties in total.&lt;ref&gt;Chandler 1995, p. 1020&lt;/ref&gt;

The Allies offered peace terms in the [[Frankfurt proposals]] in November 1813. Napoleon would remain as Emperor of France, but it would be reduced to its "natural frontiers". That meant that France could retain control of Belgium, Savoy and the Rhineland (the west bank of the Rhine River), while giving up control of all the rest, including all of Spain and the Netherlands, and most of Italy and Germany. Metternich told Napoleon these were the best terms the Allies were likely to offer; after further victories, the terms would be harsher and harsher. Metternich's motivation was to maintain France as a balance against Russian threats, while ending the highly destabilizing series of wars.&lt;ref name="J. P. Riley 2013 206"&gt;{{cite book|last=J. P. Riley|first=|title=Napoleon and the World War of 1813: Lessons in Coalition Warfighting|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=beq3AAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA206|year=2013|publisher=Routledge|page=206|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923141136/https://books.google.com/books?id=beq3AAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA206|archivedate=23 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Napoleon, expecting to win the war, delayed too long and lost this opportunity; by December the Allies had withdrawn the offer. When his back was to the wall in 1814 he tried to reopen peace negotiations on the basis of accepting the Frankfurt proposals. The Allies now had new, harsher terms that included the retreat of France to its 1791 boundaries, which meant the loss of Belgium. Napoleon would remain Emperor, however he rejected the term. The British wanted Napoleon permanently removed, and they prevailed, but Napoleon adamantly refused.&lt;ref name="J. P.

[[File:DelarocheNapoleon.jpg|thumb|Napoleon abdicated in Fontainebleau, 4 April 1814, by [[Paul Delaroche]]]]

Napoleon withdrew back into France, his army reduced to 70,000 soldiers and little cavalry; he faced more than three times as many Allied troops.&lt;ref&gt;Fremont-Barnes 2004, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; The French were surrounded: British armies pressed from the south, and other Coalition forces positioned to attack from the German states. Napoleon won a series of victories in the [[Six Days' Campaign]], though these were not significant enough to turn the tide. The leaders of Paris surrendered to the Coalition in March 1814.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|McLynn|1998|p=585}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 April, Alexander addressed the [[Sénat conservateur]]. Long docile to Napoleon, under Talleyrand's prodding it had turned against him. Alexander told the Sénat that the Allies were fighting against Napoleon, not France, and they were prepared to offer honorable peace terms if Napoleon were removed from power. The next day, the Sénat passed the [[Acte de déchéance de l'Empereur]] ("Emperor's Demise Act"), which declared Napoleon deposed. Napoleon had advanced as far as [[Fontainebleau]] when he learned that Paris was lost. When Napoleon proposed the army march on the capital, his senior officers and marshals mutinied.{{sfn|Gates|2003|page=259}} On 4 April, led by [[Michel Ney|Ney]], they confronted Napoleon. Napoleon asserted the army would follow him, and Ney replied the army would follow its generals. While the ordinary soldiers and regimental officers wanted to fight on, without any senior officers or marshals any prospective invasion of Paris would have been impossible. Bowing to the inevitable, on 4 April Napoleon abdicated in favour of his son, with Marie Louise as regent. However, the Allies refused to accept this under prodding from Alexander, who feared that Napoleon might find an excuse to retake the throne.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lieven|first=Dominic|title=Russia Against Napoleon: The True Story of the Campaigns of War and Peace|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BAWbz1iPIfoC&amp;pg=PT611|year=2010|publisher=Penguin|pages=484–85|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150320111819/http://books.google.com/books?id=BAWbz1iPIfoC&amp;pg=PT611|archivedate=20 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Napoleon was then forced to announce his unconditional abdication only two days later.

In the [[Treaty of Fontainebleau (1814)|Treaty of Fontainebleau]], the Allies exiled Napoleon to [[Elba]], an island of 12,000 inhabitants in the Mediterranean, {{convert|20|km|0|abbr=on}} off the [[Tuscany|Tuscan]] coast. They gave him sovereignty over the island and allowed him to retain the title of ''Emperor''. Napoleon attempted suicide with a pill he had carried after nearly being captured by the Russians during the retreat from Moscow.

A few months into his exile, Napoleon learned that his ex-wife Josephine had died in France. He was devastated by the news, locking himself in his room and refusing to leave for two days.&lt;ref name="pbs.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/empires/napoleon/n_josephine/newlife/page_1.html|title=PBS – Napoleon: Napoleon and Josephine|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170821213718/http://www.pbs.org/empires/napoleon/n_josephine/newlife/page_1.html|archivedate=21 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Hundred Days ====
{{Main|Hundred Days}}
[[File:Retour de Napoleon d' Isle d'Elbe, by Charles de Steuben.jpg|thumb|Napoleon's return from Elba, by [[Charles de Steuben]]]]

Separated from his wife and son, who had returned to Austria, cut off from the allowance guaranteed to him by the Treaty of Fontainebleau, and aware of rumours he was about to be banished to a remote island in the Atlantic Ocean,&lt;ref name=Mclynn604 /&gt; Napoleon escaped from Elba, in the [[brig]] [[French brig Inconstant (1811)|''Inconstant'']] on 26 February 1815 with 700 men.&lt;ref name=Mclynn604 /&gt; Two days later, he landed on the French mainland at [[Golfe-Juan]] and started heading north.&lt;ref name=Mclynn604&gt;{{Harvnb|McLynn|1998|p=604}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 5th Regiment was sent to intercept him and made contact [[Route Napoléon|just south]] of [[Grenoble]] on 7 March 1815. Napoleon approached the regiment alone, dismounted his horse and, when he was within gunshot range, shouted to the soldiers, "Here I am. Kill your Emperor, if you wish".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|McLynn|1998|p=605}}&lt;/ref&gt; The soldiers quickly responded with, "Vive L'Empereur!" Ney, who had boasted to the restored Bourbon king, [[Louis XVIII of France|Louis XVIII]], that he would bring Napoleon to Paris in an iron cage, affectionately kissed his former emperor and forgot his oath of allegiance to the Bourbon monarch. The two then marched together towards Paris with a growing army. The unpopular Louis XVIII fled to Belgium after realizing he had little political support. On 13 March, the powers at the [[Congress of Vienna]] declared Napoleon an [[outlaw]]. Four days later, Great Britain, Russia, Austria, and Prussia each pledged to put 150,000 men into the field to end his rule.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|McLynn|1998|p=607}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Napoleon arrived in Paris on 20 March and governed for a period now called the Hundred Days. By the start of June the armed forces available to him had reached 200,000, and he decided to go on the offensive to attempt to drive a wedge between the oncoming British and Prussian armies. The French Army of the North crossed the frontier into the [[United Kingdom of the Netherlands]], in modern-day Belgium.&lt;ref&gt;Chesney 2006, p. 35&lt;/ref&gt;

Napoleon's forces fought the Coalition armies, commanded by the [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Duke of Wellington]] and [[Gebhard Leberecht von Blücher]], at the [[Battle of Waterloo]] on 18 June 1815. Wellington's army withstood repeated attacks by the French and drove them from the field while the Prussians arrived in force and broke through Napoleon's right flank.

Napoleon returned to Paris and found that both the legislature and the people had turned against him. Realizing his position was untenable, [[Abdication of Napoleon, 1815|he abdicated on 22 June in favour of his son]]. He left Paris three days later and settled at Josephine's former palace in [[Château de Malmaison|Malmaison]] (on the western bank of the [[Seine]] about {{convert|17|km|mi}} west of Paris). Even as Napoleon travelled to Paris, the Coalition forces swept through France (arriving in the vicinity of Paris on 29 June), with the stated intent of restoring Louis XVIII to the French throne.

When Napoleon heard that Prussian troops had orders to capture him dead or alive, he fled to [[Rochefort, Charente-Maritime|Rochefort]], considering an escape to the United States. British ships were blocking every port. Napoleon demanded asylum from the British [[Frederick Lewis Maitland (Royal Navy officer)|Captain Frederick Maitland]] on {{HMS|Bellerophon|1786|6}} on 15 July 1815.&lt;ref&gt;Cordingly 2004, p. 254&lt;/ref&gt;

The British kept Napoleon on the island of [[Saint Helena]] in the Atlantic Ocean, {{convert|1870|km|0|abbr=on}} from the west coast of Africa. They also took the precaution of sending a garrison of soldiers, with an experienced officer ([[Edward Nicolls]]), to uninhabited [[Ascension Island]], which lay between St. Helena and Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

With a small cadre of followers, Napoleon dictated his memoirs and grumbled about conditions. Lowe cut Napoleon's expenditure, ruled that no gifts were allowed if they mentioned his imperial status, and made his supporters sign a guarantee they would stay with the prisoner indefinitely.&lt;ref name=Lowe&gt;{{Harvnb|McLynn|1998|p=642}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While in exile, Napoleon wrote a book about [[Julius Caesar]], one of his great heroes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.amazon.com/Chronicles-Caesars-Wars-First-Ever-Translation-ebook/dp/B076ZVK49R/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;keywords=chronicles+of+caesars+wars&amp;qid=1511472764&amp;sr=8-1|title=Chronicles of Caesar's Wars: The First-Ever Translation|last=I|first=Napoleon|last2=Marchand|first2=Louis Joseph|date=29 October 2017|publisher=Clio Books|edition=1|language=English|translator-last=Barzani|translator-first=Arshan|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171203115923/https://www.amazon.com/Chronicles-Caesars-Wars-First-Ever-Translation-ebook/dp/B076ZVK49R/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;keywords=chronicles+of+caesars+wars&amp;qid=1511472764&amp;sr=8-1|archivedate=3 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also studied English under the tutelage of [[Emmanuel, comte de Las Cases|Count Emmanuel de Las Cases]] with the main aim of being able to read English newspapers and books, as access to French newspapers and books was heavily restricted to him on Saint Helena.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hicks|first1=Peter|title=Napoleon’s English Lessons|url=https://www.napoleon.org/en/history-of-the-two-empires/articles/napoleons-english-lessons/|website=Napoleon.org|accessdate=24 March 2018|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160918214137/https://www.napoleon.org/en/history-of-the-two-empires/articles/napoleons-english-lessons/|archivedate=18 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There were rumours of plots and even of his escape, but in reality no serious attempts were made.&lt;ref&gt;Wilkins 1972&lt;/ref&gt; For English poet [[Lord Byron]], Napoleon was the epitome of the Romantic hero, the persecuted, lonely, and flawed genius.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|McLynn|1998|p=651}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Death ===
{{Further|Death mask of Napoleon|Retour des cendres}}
[[File:Napoleon Death Mask.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Bronze death mask of Napoleon I, modelled in 1821, cast in 1833]]

Napoleon's personal physician, [[Barry O'Meara]], warned London that his declining state of health was mainly caused by the harsh treatment. Napoleon confined himself for months on end in his damp and wretched habitation of Longwood.&lt;ref&gt;Albert Benhamou, ''[http://www.inside-longwood.com/ Inside Longwood – Barry O'Meara's clandestine letters] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121211020132/http://www.inside-longwood.com/ |date=11 December 2012 }}'', 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 1821, Napoleon's health began to deteriorate rapidly, and he reconciled with the Catholic Church. He died on 5 May 1821, after confession, [[Anointing of the Sick (Catholic Church)|Extreme Unction]] and [[Viaticum]] in the presence of Father Ange Vignali. His last words were, ''France, l'armée, tête d'armée, Joséphine'' ("France, the army, head of the army, Joséphine").&lt;ref name="McLynn655"&gt;{{Harvnb|McLynn|1998|p=655}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, ''Napoleon '' (2014) 799–801&lt;/ref&gt;

Napoleon's original [[death mask]] was created around 6 May, although it is not clear which doctor created it.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson 1975, pp. 293–95&lt;/ref&gt;{{#tag:ref|It was customary to cast a death mask of a leader. At least four genuine death masks of Napoleon are known to exist: one in [[The Cabildo]] in New Orleans, one in a Liverpool museum, another in Havana and one in the library of the [[University of North Carolina]].&lt;ref&gt;Fulghum 2007&lt;/ref&gt;|group=note}} In his will, he had asked to be buried on the banks of the Seine, but the British governor said he should be buried on Saint Helena, in the Valley of the Willows.&lt;ref name="McLynn655"/&gt;

[[File:Napoleone Bonaparte's Tomb.jpg|thumb|Napoleon's tomb at [[Les Invalides]]]]

In 1840, [[Louis Philippe I]] obtained permission from the British to return Napoleon's remains to France. On 15 December 1840, a [[state funeral]] was held. The hearse proceeded from the Arc de Triomphe down the [[Champs-Élysées]], across the [[Place de la Concorde]] to the [[Les Invalides|Esplanade des Invalides]] and then to the cupola in St Jérôme's Chapel, where it remained until the tomb designed by [[Louis Visconti]] was completed.

In 1861, Napoleon's remains were entombed in a [[Porphyry (geology)|porphyry stone]] [[sarcophagus]] in the crypt under the dome at Les Invalides.&lt;ref&gt;Driskel 1993, p. 168&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Cause of death ====
The cause of his death has been debated. Napoleon's physician, [[François Carlo Antommarchi]], led the autopsy, which found the cause of death to be [[stomach cancer]]. Antommarchi did not sign the official report.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|McLynn|1998|p=656}}&lt;/ref&gt; Napoleon's father had died of stomach cancer, although this was apparently unknown at the time of the autopsy.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson 2002, pp. 180–81&lt;/ref&gt; Antommarchi found evidence of a stomach ulcer; this was the most convenient explanation for the British, who wanted to avoid criticism over their care of Napoleon.&lt;ref name="McLynn655" /&gt;

[[File:Napoleon sur son lit de mort Horace Vernet 1826.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Gold-framed portrait painting of a gaunt middle-aged man with receding hair and laurel wreath, lying eyes-closed on white pillow with a white blanket covering to his neck and a gold Jesus cross resting on his chest|''Napoleon on His Death Bed'', by [[Horace Vernet]], 1826]]
In 1955, the diaries of Napoleon's valet, Louis Marchand, were published. His description of Napoleon in the months before his death led [[Sten Forshufvud]] in a 1961 paper in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' to put forward other causes for his death, including deliberate [[arsenic poisoning]].&lt;ref name=Cullen&gt;Cullen 2008, pp. 146–48&lt;/ref&gt; Arsenic was used as a poison during the era because it was undetectable when administered over a long period. Forshufvud, in a 1978 book with [[Ben Weider]], noted that Napoleon's body was found to be well preserved when moved in 1840. Arsenic is a strong preservative, and therefore this supported the poisoning hypothesis. Forshufvud and Weider observed that Napoleon had attempted to quench abnormal thirst by drinking large amounts of [[orgeat syrup]] that contained cyanide compounds in the almonds used for flavouring.&lt;ref name=Cullen /&gt;

They maintained that the [[potassium tartrate]] used in his treatment prevented his stomach from expelling these compounds and that his thirst was a symptom of the poison. Their hypothesis was that the [[calomel]] given to Napoleon became an overdose, which killed him and left extensive [[tissue (biology)|tissue]] damage behind.&lt;ref name=Cullen /&gt; According to a 2007 article, the type of arsenic found in Napoleon's hair shafts was mineral, the most toxic, and according to toxicologist Patrick Kintz, this supported the conclusion that he was murdered.&lt;ref name=cullen156&gt;Cullen 2008, p. 156&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been modern studies that have supported the original autopsy finding.&lt;ref name=cullen156 /&gt; In a 2008 study, researchers analysed samples of Napoleon's hair from throughout his life, as well as samples from his family and other contemporaries. All samples had high levels of arsenic, approximately 100 times higher than the current average. According to these researchers, Napoleon's body was already heavily contaminated with arsenic as a boy, and the high arsenic concentration in his hair was not caused by intentional poisoning; people were constantly exposed to arsenic from glues and dyes throughout their lives.{{#tag:ref|The body can tolerate large doses of arsenic if ingested regularly, and arsenic was a fashionable [[Panacea (medicine)|cure-all]].&lt;ref&gt;Cullen 2008, p. 50&lt;/ref&gt;|group=note}} Studies published in 2007 and 2008 dismissed evidence of arsenic poisoning, and confirmed evidence of [[peptic ulcer]] and [[gastric cancer]] as the cause of death.&lt;ref&gt;Cullen 2008, p. 161, and Hindmarsh et al. 2008, p. 2092&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Further|Napoleon and the Catholic Church}}
[[File:France dioceses 1801.svg|thumb|right|Reorganisation of the religious geography: France is divided into 59 [[diocese]]s and 10 [[ecclesiastical provinces]].]]

Napoleon's baptism took place in [[Ajaccio]] on 21 July 1771; he was piously raised as a Catholic but he never developed much faith.&lt;ref name="napoleon.org"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.napoleon.org/fr/salle_lecture/articles/files/Empire_Saint-Siege_Napoleon_religion.asp |title=L'Empire et le Saint-Siège |publisher=Napoleon.org |accessdate=15 June 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110919124850/http://www.napoleon.org/fr/salle_lecture/articles/files/Empire_Saint-Siege_Napoleon_religion.asp |archivedate=19 September 2011  }}&lt;/ref&gt; As an adult, Napoleon was a [[Deism|deist]]. Napoleon's deity was an absent and distant God. However he had a keen appreciation of the power of organised religion in social and political affairs, and paid a great deal of attention to bending it to his purposes. He noted the influence of Catholicism's rituals and splendors.&lt;ref name="napoleon.org" /&gt; Napoleon had a [[civil marriage]] with Joséphine de Beauharnais, without religious ceremony. Napoleon was crowned Emperor on 2 December 1804 at [[Notre-Dame de Paris]] in a ceremony presided over by [[Pope Pius VII]]. On the eve of the Coronation ceremony, and at the insistence of Pope Pius VII, a private religious wedding ceremony of Napoleon and Joséphine was celebrated. Cardinal Fesch performed the wedding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.napoleon.org/en/history-of-the-two-empires/timelines/napoleons-divorce/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=20 January 2018 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180121071220/https://www.napoleon.org/en/history-of-the-two-empires/timelines/napoleons-divorce/ |archivedate=21 January 2018  }}&lt;/ref&gt; This marriage was annulled by tribunals under Napoleon's control in January 1810. On 1 April 1810, Napoleon married the Austrian princess [[Marie Louise, Duchess of Parma|Marie Louise]] in a Catholic ceremony. During his [[Kingdom of Spain (Napoleonic)|brother's rule in Spain]], he abolished the [[Spanish Inquisition]] in 1813. Napoleon was excommunicated by the Catholic Church, but later reconciled with the Church before his death in 1821.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.catholictextbookproject.com/this-day-in-history/this-day-in-history-31/ catholictextbookproject.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Concordat ===
{{Further|Concordat of 1801}}
[[File:FrenchChurchOathConcordat.jpg|thumb|Leaders of the Catholic Church taking the civil oath required by [[Concordat of 1801|the Concordat]]]]
Seeking national reconciliation between revolutionaries and Catholics, the Concordat of 1801 was signed on 15 July 1801 between Napoleon and [[Pope Pius VII]]. It solidified the Roman Catholic Church as the majority church of France and brought back most of its civil status. The hostility of devout Catholics against the state had now largely been resolved. It did not restore the vast church lands and endowments that had been seized during the revolution and sold off. As a part of the Concordat, he presented another set of laws called the [[Organic Articles]].&lt;ref&gt;William Roberts, "Napoleon, the Concordat of 1801, and Its Consequences". in by Frank J. Coppa, ed., ''Controversial Concordats: The Vatican's Relations with Napoleon, Mussolini, and Hitler'' (1999) pp. 34–80.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nigel Aston, ''Religion and revolution in France, 1780–1804'' ([[Catholic University of America Press]], 2000) pp. 279–315&lt;/ref&gt;

While the Concordat restored much power to the [[pope|papacy]], the balance of church–state relations had tilted firmly in Napoleon's favour. He selected the bishops and supervised church finances. Napoleon and the pope both found the Concordat useful. Similar arrangements were made with the Church in territories controlled by Napoleon, especially Italy and Germany.&lt;ref&gt;Nigel Aston, ''Christianity and revolutionary Europe, 1750–1830'' ([[Cambridge University Press]], 2002) pp. 261–62.&lt;/ref&gt; Now, Napoleon could win favor with the Catholics while also controlling Rome in a political sense. Napoleon said in April 1801, "Skillful conquerors have not got entangled with priests. They can both contain them and use them". French children were issued a catechism that taught them to love and respect Napoleon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Luis Granados|title=Damned Good Company|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=T9Vsms3huxgC&amp;pg=PT182|year=2012|publisher=Humanist Press|pages=182–83|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150922000725/https://books.google.com/books?id=T9Vsms3huxgC&amp;pg=PT182|archivedate=22 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arrest of Pope Pius VII===

=== Religious emancipation ===
{{Further|Napoleon and the Jews|Napoleon and Protestants}}
Napoleon [[Jewish emancipation|emancipated Jews]], as well as Protestants in Catholic countries and Catholics in Protestant countries, from laws which restricted them to [[ghetto]]s, and he expanded their rights to property, worship, and careers. Despite the anti-semitic reaction to Napoleon's policies from foreign governments and within France, he believed emancipation would benefit France by attracting Jews to the country given the restrictions they faced elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|McLynn|1998|p=436}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1806 an Assembly of Jewish notables was gathered by Napoleon to discuss 12 questions broadly dealing with the relations between Jews, Christians and other issues dealing with the Jewish ability to integrate into the general French society. Later, after the questions were answered in a satisfactory way according to the Emperor, a "[[Grand Sanhedrin|great Sanhedrin]]" was brought together to transform the answers into decisions that would form the basis of the future status of the Jews in France and the rest of the Empire Napoleon was building.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.haaretz.com/jewish/this-day-in-jewish-history/.premium-1.573141|title=This Day in Jewish History / The Sanhedrin of Paris Convenes at the Behest of Napoleon|last=Green|first=David B.|date=9 February 2014|work=Haaretz|access-date=21 November 2017|language=en|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171201041659/https://www.haaretz.com/jewish/this-day-in-jewish-history/.premium-1.573141|archivedate=1 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He stated, "I will never accept any proposals that will obligate the Jewish people to leave France, because to me the Jews are the same as any other citizen in our country. It takes weakness to chase them out of the country, but it takes strength to assimilate them".&lt;ref&gt;Schwarzfuchs 1979, p. 50&lt;/ref&gt; He was seen as so favourable to the Jews that the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] formally condemned him as "[[Antichrist]] and the Enemy of God".&lt;ref&gt;Cronin 1994, p. 315&lt;/ref&gt;

One year after the final meeting of the Sanhedrin, on 17 March 1808, Napoleon placed the Jews on probation. Several new laws restricting the citizenship the Jews had been offered 17 years previously were instituted at that time. However, despite pressure from leaders of a number of Christian communities to refrain from granting Jews emancipation, within one year of the issue of the new restrictions, they were once again lifted in response to the appeal of Jews from all over France.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Historians emphasize the strength of the ambition that took Napoleon from an obscure village to command of most of Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Pieter Geyl, ''Napoleon, For and Against'' (1982)&lt;/ref&gt; In-depth academic studies about [[Napoleon#origins and education|his early life]] conclude that up until age 2, he had a "gentle [[disposition]]".&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; His older brother, [[Joseph Bonaparte|Joseph]], frequently received their mother's attention which made Napoleon more assertive and approval-driven. During his early schooling years he would be harshly bullied by classmates for his Corsican identity and control of the French language.

Napoleon maintained strict, efficient work habits, prioritizing what needed to be done. He cheated at cards, but repaid the losses; he had to win at everything he attempted.&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, ''Napoleon: A Life '' (2014) pp. 470–73&lt;/ref&gt; He kept relays of staff and secretaries at work. Unlike many generals, Napoleon did not examine history to ask what [[Hannibal]] or [[Alexander the Great|Alexander]] or anyone else did in a similar situation. Critics said he won many battles simply because of luck; Napoleon responded, "Give me lucky generals", aware that "luck" comes to leaders who recognize opportunity, and seize it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Gregory R.

In terms of influence on events, it was more than Napoleon's personality that took effect. He reorganized France itself to supply the men and money needed for wars.&lt;ref&gt;J. M. Thompson, ''Napoleon Bonaparte: His Rise and Fall'' (1954), p. 285&lt;/ref&gt; He inspired his men—[[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Wellington]] said his presence on the battlefield was worth 40,000 soldiers, for he inspired confidence from privates to field marshals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Christopher Hibbert|title=Wellington: A Personal History|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Ni8Mc1b1ygAC&amp;pg=PA171|year=1999|publisher=Da Capo Press|page=171|isbn=0-7382-0148-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also unnerved the enemy. At the [[Battle of Auerstadt]] in 1806, King [[Frederick William III of Prussia]] outnumbered the French by 63,000 to 27,000; however, when he was told, mistakenly, that Napoleon was in command, he ordered a hasty retreat that turned into a rout.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|McLynn|1998|p=357}}&lt;/ref&gt; The force of his personality neutralized material difficulties as his soldiers fought with the confidence that with Napoleon in charge they would surely win.&lt;ref&gt;Steven Englund, ''Napoleon: A Political Life'' (2004), pp. 379ff&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Further|Cultural depictions of Napoleon}}

Napoleon has become a worldwide cultural icon who symbolises military genius and political power. [[Martin van Creveld]] described him as "the most competent human being who ever lived".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Command in War|edition= |last= van Crevald|first= Martin|year= 1987|location= Massachusetts|publisher= [[Harvard University Press]] |isbn= 0-674-14441-4 |page= 64}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since his death, many towns, streets, ships, and even cartoon characters have been named after him.

[[File:Napoleon in 1806.PNG|thumb|upright|left|Napoleon is often represented in his green colonel uniform of the [[Chasseurs à Cheval de la Garde Impériale|Chasseur à Cheval of the Imperial Guard]], the regiment that often served as his personal escort, with a large [[bicorne]] and a [[hand-in-waistcoat]] gesture.]]

When met in person, many of his contemporaries were surprised by his apparently unremarkable physical appearance in contrast to his significant deeds and reputation, especially in his youth, when he was consistently described as small and thin. Joseph Farington, who observed Napoleon personally in 1802, commented that "Samuel Rogers stood a little way from me and&amp;nbsp;... seemed to be disappointed in the look of [Napoleon's] countenance [face] and said it was that of a little Italian." Farington said Napoleon's eyes were "lighter, and more of a grey, than I should have expected from his complexion", that "His person is below middle size", and that "his general aspect was milder than I had before thought it."&lt;ref&gt;The Fortnightly, Volume 114. Chapman and Hall, 1923. p. 836.&lt;/ref&gt; A personal friend of Napoleon's said that when he first met him in [[Brienne-le-Château]] as a young man, Napoleon was only notable "for the dark color of his complexion, for his piercing and scrutinising glance, and for the style of his conversation"; he also said that Napoleon was personally a serious and somber man: "his conversation bore the appearance of ill-humor, and he was certainly not very amiable."&lt;ref&gt;Louis Antoine Fauvelet de Bourrienne. "Memoirs of Napoleon Bonaparte." Charles Scribner's Sons, 1889. Vol. 1, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; Johann Ludwig Wurstemberger, who accompanied Napoleon from Camp Fornio in 1797 and on the Swiss campaign of 1798, noted that "Bonaparte was rather slight and emaciated-looking; his face, too, was very thin, with a dark complexion&amp;nbsp;... his black, unpowdered hair hung down evenly over both shoulders", but that, despite his slight and unkempt appearance, "His looks and expression were earnest and powerful."&lt;ref&gt;Kircheisen, F. M. ''Napoleon'' New York : Harcourt, Brace, 1932&lt;/ref&gt; [[Denis Davydov]] met him personally and considered him remarkably average in appearance: "His face was slightly swarthy, with regular features. His nose was not very large, but straight, with a slight, hardly noticeable bend. The hair on his head was dark reddish-blond; his eyebrows and eyelashes were much darker than the colour of his hair, and his blue eyes, set off by the almost black lashes, gave him a most pleasing expression&amp;nbsp;... The man I saw was of short stature, just over five feet tall, rather heavy although he was only 37 years old."&lt;ref&gt;Davydov, Denis.

During the Napoleonic Wars he was taken seriously by the British press as a dangerous [[tyrant]], poised to invade. Napoleon was mocked in British newspapers as a short tempered small man and he was nicknamed "Little Boney in a strong fit".&lt;ref name="nationalpostBoney"&gt;{{cite web

It is more likely that he was {{conv|5|ft|2|in|m}}, the height he was measured at on St. Helena (a British island), since he would have most likely been measured with an English yardstick rather than a yardstick of the Old French Regime.&lt;ref name="Owen Connelly 2006 7"/&gt; Napoleon surrounded himself with tall bodyguards and was affectionately nicknamed ''le petit caporal'' (the little corporal), reflecting his reported camaraderie with his soldiers rather than his height.

When he became First Consul and later Emperor, Napoleon eschewed his general's uniform and habitually wore the green colonel uniform (non-Hussar) of a colonel of the [[Chasseurs à Cheval de la Garde Impériale|Chasseur à Cheval of the Imperial Guard]], the regiment that served as his personal escort many times, with a large [[bicorne]]. He also habitually wore (usually on Sundays) the blue uniform of a colonel of the [[Imperial Guard (Napoleon I)|Imperial Guard]] Foot Grenadiers (blue with white facings and red cuffs). He also wore his [[Légion d'honneur]] star, medal and ribbon, and the [[Order of the Iron Crown]] decorations, white French-style [[culotte]]s and white stockings. This was in contrast to the complex uniforms with many decorations of his [[Marshal of the Empire|marshals]] and those around him.

In his later years he gained quite a bit of weight and had a complexion considered pale or sallow, something contemporaries took note of. Novelist Paul de Kock, who saw him in 1811 on the balcony of the Tuileries, called Napoleon "yellow, obese, and bloated".&lt;ref&gt;Seward, Desmond. ''Napoleon's Family''. New York: Viking, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt; A British captain who met him in 1815 stated "I felt very much disappointed, as I believe everyone else did, in his appearance&amp;nbsp;... He is fat, rather what we call pot-bellied, and although his leg is well shaped, it is rather clumsy&amp;nbsp;... He is very sallow, with light grey eyes, and rather thin, greasy-looking brown hair, and altogether a very nasty, priestlike-looking fellow."&lt;ref&gt;The Bookman, Vol. 29, p. 304. Diary of Capt. Ross, commander of the Northumberland.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[stock character]] of Napoleon is a comically short "petty tyrant" and this has become a cliché in popular culture. He is often portrayed wearing a large [[bicorne]] hat with a [[hand-in-waistcoat]] gesture—a reference to the painting produced in 1812 by Jacques-Louis David.{{sfn|Bordes|2007|p=118}} In 1908 [[Alfred Adler]], a psychologist, cited Napoleon to describe an [[inferiority complex]] in which short people adopt an over-aggressive behaviour to compensate for lack of height; this inspired the term ''[[Napoleon complex]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Hall 2006, p. 181&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reforms ==

Napoleon instituted various reforms, such as higher education, a [[tax code]], road and sewer systems, and established the [[Banque de France]], the first central bank in French history. He negotiated the [[Concordat of 1801]] with the Catholic Church, which sought to reconcile the mostly Catholic population to his regime. It was presented alongside the [[Organic Articles]], which regulated public worship in France. He dissolved the [[Holy Roman Empire]] prior to [[German Unification]] later in the 19th century. The sale of the Louisiana Territory to the United States doubled the size of the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|McGRAW-HILL'S, US History|2012|pp=112–113}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 1802, he instituted the [[Legion of Honour]], a substitute for the old royalist decorations and [[chivalric order|orders of chivalry]], to encourage civilian and military achievements; the order is still the highest decoration in France.&lt;ref&gt;Blaufarb 2007, pp. 101–02&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Napoleonic Code ===
{{Main|Napoleonic Code}}
[[File:Code Civil 1804.png|thumb|alt=Page of French writing|First page of the 1804 original edition of the [[civil code|Code Civil]]]]
Napoleon's [[civil code|set of civil laws]], the ''Code Civil''—now often known as the Napoleonic Code—was prepared by committees of legal experts under the supervision of [[Jean Jacques Régis de Cambacérès]], the ''Second Consul''. Napoleon participated actively in the sessions of the [[Council of State (France)|Council of State]] that revised the drafts. The development of the code was a fundamental change in the nature of the [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] legal system with its stress on clearly written and accessible law. Other codes ("[[Les cinq codes]]") were commissioned by Napoleon to codify criminal and commerce law; a Code of Criminal Instruction was published, which enacted rules of [[due process]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|McLynn|1998|p=255}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Napoleonic code was adopted throughout much of Continental Europe, though only in the lands he conquered, and remained in force after Napoleon's defeat. Napoleon said: "My true glory is not to have won forty battles&amp;nbsp;... Waterloo will erase the memory of so many victories.&amp;nbsp;... But&amp;nbsp;... what will live forever, is my Civil Code".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Bernard Schwartz|title=The Code Napoleon and the Common-law World|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_xeZBvbdN2IC&amp;pg=PA7|year=1998|publisher=The Lawbook Exchange|page=7|isbn=978-1-886363-59-5|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923115525/https://books.google.com/books?id=_xeZBvbdN2IC&amp;pg=PA7|archivedate=23 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Code influences a quarter of the world's jurisdictions such as that of in Continental Europe, the Americas and Africa.&lt;ref&gt;Wood 2007, p. 55&lt;/ref&gt;

Dieter Langewiesche described the code as a "revolutionary project" which spurred the development of [[bourgeoisie|bourgeois society]] in Germany by the extension of the right to own property and an acceleration towards the end of [[feudalism]]. Napoleon reorganised what had been the Holy Roman Empire, made up of more than a thousand entities, {{Quantify|date=August 2016}} into a more streamlined forty-state [[Confederation of the Rhine]]; this helped promote the [[German Confederation]] and the [[unification of Germany]] in 1871.&lt;ref&gt;Scheck 2008, Chapter: The Road to National Unification&lt;/ref&gt;

The movement toward national unification in Italy was similarly precipitated by Napoleonic rule.&lt;ref&gt;Astarita 2005, p. 264&lt;/ref&gt; These changes contributed to the development of nationalism and the [[nation state]].&lt;ref&gt;Alter 2006, pp. 61–76&lt;/ref&gt;

Napoleon implemented a wide array of liberal reforms in France and across Continental Europe, especially in Italy and Germany, as summarized by British historian [[Andrew Roberts (historian)|Andrew Roberts]]:

{{quote|The ideas that underpin our modern world—meritocracy, equality before the law, property rights, religious toleration, modern secular education, sound finances, and so on—were championed, consolidated, codified and geographically extended by Napoleon. To them he added a rational and efficient local administration, an end to rural banditry, the encouragement of science and the arts, the abolition of feudalism and the greatest codification of laws since the fall of the Roman Empire.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Roberts, ''Napoleon: A Life'' (2014) p xxxiii&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Napoleon directly overthrew remnants of feudalism in much of western Continental Europe. He liberalised [[property law]]s, ended [[Manorialism|seigneurial dues]], abolished the [[guild]] of merchants and craftsmen to facilitate entrepreneurship, legalised divorce, closed the [[Ghetto|Jewish ghettos]] and made Jews equal to everyone else. The [[Spanish Inquisition|Inquisition]] ended as did the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. The power of church courts and religious authority was sharply reduced and [[Equality before the law|equality under the law]] was proclaimed for all men.&lt;ref&gt;Robert R. Palmer and Joel Colton, ''A History of the Modern World'' (New York: McGraw Hill, 1995), pp. 428–29&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Warfare ===
{{Further|Napoleonic weaponry and warfare|Military career of Napoleon Bonaparte}}

Napoleon is seated on the horse, which is rearing up, he looks forward with his right hand raised and pointing forward; his left hand holds the reins.|Statue in [[Cherbourg-Octeville]] unveiled by Napoleon III in 1858. Napoleon I strengthened the town's defences to prevent British naval incursions.]]
In the field of [[military organisation]], Napoleon borrowed from previous theorists such as [[Jacques Antoine Hippolyte, Comte de Guibert]], and from the reforms of preceding French governments, and then developed much of what was already in place. He continued the policy, which emerged from the Revolution, of promotion based primarily on merit.&lt;ref name=Archer /&gt;

[[Corps]] replaced divisions as the largest army units, [[Self-propelled artillery|mobile artillery]] was integrated into reserve batteries, the staff system became more fluid and cavalry returned as an important formation in French military doctrine. These methods are now referred to as essential features of Napoleonic warfare.&lt;ref name=Archer&gt;Archer et al. 2002, p. 397&lt;/ref&gt; Though he consolidated the practice of modern [[conscription]] introduced by the Directory, one of the restored monarchy's first acts was to end it.&lt;ref&gt;Flynn 2001, p. 16&lt;/ref&gt;

His opponents learned from Napoleon's innovations. The increased importance of artillery after 1807 stemmed from his creation of a highly mobile artillery force, the growth in artillery numbers, and changes in artillery practices. As a result of these factors, Napoleon, rather than relying on infantry to wear away the enemy's defenses, now could use massed artillery as a spearhead to pound a break in the enemy's line that was then exploited by supporting infantry and cavalry. McConachy rejects the alternative theory that growing reliance on artillery by the French army beginning in 1807 was an outgrowth of the declining quality of the French infantry and, later, France's inferiority in cavalry numbers.&lt;ref&gt;Bruce McConachy, "The Roots of Artillery Doctrine: Napoleonic Artillery Tactics Reconsidered", ''Journal of Military History'' 2001 65(3): 617–640. [https://www.jstor.org/pss/2677528 in JSTOR]; [http://www.reenactor.ru/ARH/PDF/McConachy.pdf online] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120119131512/http://www.reenactor.ru/ARH/PDF/McConachy.pdf |date=19 January 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Weapons and other kinds of military technology remained static through the Revolutionary and Napoleonic eras, but 18th-century [[operational mobility]] underwent change.&lt;ref&gt;Archer et al. 2002, p. 383&lt;/ref&gt;

Napoleon's biggest influence was in the conduct of warfare. [[Antoine-Henri Jomini]] explained Napoleon's methods in a widely used textbook that influenced all European and American armies.&lt;ref&gt;John Shy, "Jomini" in Peter Paret, ed. ''Makers of Modern Strategy: From Machiavelli to the Nuclear Age'' (1986).&lt;/ref&gt; Napoleon was regarded by the influential military theorist [[Carl von Clausewitz]] as a genius in the operational art of war, and historians rank him as a great military commander.&lt;ref&gt;Archer et al. 2002, p. 380&lt;/ref&gt; Wellington, when asked who was the greatest general of the day, answered: "In this age, in past ages, in any age, Napoleon".&lt;ref&gt;Roberts 2001, p. 272&lt;/ref&gt;

Under Napoleon, a new emphasis towards the destruction, not just outmanoeuvring, of enemy armies emerged. Invasions of enemy territory occurred over broader fronts which made wars costlier and more decisive. The political effect of war increased; defeat for a European power meant more than the loss of isolated enclaves. Near-[[Carthaginian peace]]s intertwined whole national efforts, intensifying the Revolutionary phenomenon of total war.&lt;ref&gt;Archer et al. 2002, p. 404&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Metric system ===

The official introduction of the metric system in September 1799 was unpopular in large sections of French society. Napoleon's rule greatly aided adoption of the new standard not only across France but also across the French [[sphere of influence]]. Napoleon took a retrograde step in 1812 when he passed legislation to introduce the ''[[mesures usuelles]]'' (traditional units of measurement) for retail trade,&lt;ref name=H&amp;H&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/outlinesofevolut00halluoft/outlinesofevolut00halluoft_djvu.txt|title=Outlines of the evolution of weights and measures and the metric system|first1=William|last1=Hallock|first2=Herbert T|last2=Wade|publisher=The Macmillan Company|year=1906|pages=66–69|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; a system of measure that resembled the pre-revolutionary units but were based on the kilogram and the metre; for example, the ''livre metrique'' (metric pound) was 500&amp;nbsp;g,&lt;ref name=historique&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.industrie.gouv.fr/metro/aquoisert/metre.htm|title=Un historique du mètre|language=French|author=Denis Février|publisher=Ministère de l'Economie, des Finances et de l'Industrie|accessdate=10 March 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110228185545/http://www.industrie.gouv.fr/metro/aquoisert/metre.htm|archivedate=28 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; in contrast to the value of the ''livre du roi'' (the king's pound), 489.5&amp;nbsp;g.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Les poids et mesures sous l'Ancien Régime|language=French|trans-title=The weights and measures of the Ancien Régime|url=http://www.histoire-genealogie.com/spip.php?article396|author=Thierry Sabot|date=1 October 2000|accessdate=10 February 2011|publisher=histoire-genealogie|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101205154531/http://www.histoire-genealogie.com/spip.php?article396|archivedate=5 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other units of measure were rounded in a similar manner prior to the definitive introduction of the metric system across parts of Europe in the middle of the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;O'Connor 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Education ===
Napoleon's educational reforms laid the foundation of a modern system of education in France and throughout much of Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Clive Emsley|title=Napoleon: Conquest, Reform and Reorganisation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=L7sbBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA52|year=2014|publisher=Routledge|page=52|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151018173545/https://books.google.com/books?id=L7sbBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA52|archivedate=18 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Napoleon synthesized the best academic elements from the ''Ancien Régime'', [[The Enlightenment]], and the Revolution, with the aim of establishing a stable, well-educated and prosperous society. He made French the only official language. He left some primary education in the hands of religious orders, but he offered public support to secondary education. Napoleon founded a number of state secondary schools (''[[Secondary education in France#Lycée|lycées]]'') designed to produce a standardized education that was uniform across France. All students were taught the sciences along with modern and classical languages. Unlike the system during the ''Ancien Régime'', religious topics did not dominate the curriculum, although they were present with the teachers from the clergy. Napoleon hoped to use religion to produce social stability.&lt;ref&gt;L. Pearce Williams, "Science, education and Napoleon I". ''Isis'' (1956): 369–382 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/226629 in JSTOR] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171203115348/https://www.jstor.org/stable/226629 |date=3 December 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He gave special attention to the advanced centers, such as the École Polytechnique, that provided both military expertise and state-of-the-art research in science.&lt;ref&gt;Margaret Bradley, "Scientific education versus military training: the influence of Napoleon Bonaparte on the École Polytechnique".

In the political realm, historians debate whether Napoleon was "an enlightened despot who laid the foundations of modern Europe or, instead, a megalomaniac who wrought greater misery than any man before the coming of Hitler".&lt;ref&gt;Max Hastings, "Everything is Owed to Glory", [https://online.wsj.com/articles/book-review-napoleon-a-life-by-andrew-roberts-1414788232 ''The Wall Street Journal '' October 31, 2014] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141113133508/http://online.wsj.com/articles/book-review-napoleon-a-life-by-andrew-roberts-1414788232 |date=13 November 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many historians have concluded that he had grandiose foreign policy ambitions. The Continental powers as late as 1808 were willing to give him nearly all of his gains and titles, but some scholars maintain he was overly aggressive and pushed for too much, until his empire collapsed.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Esdaile, ''Napoleon's Wars: An International History 1803–1815'' (2008), p 39&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Colin S.

Napoleon ended lawlessness and disorder in post-Revolutionary France.&lt;ref&gt;Abbott 2005, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; He was considered a tyrant and [[usurper]] by his opponents.&lt;ref name=M666&gt;{{Harvnb|McLynn|1998|p=666}}&lt;/ref&gt; His critics {{Who|date=August 2016}} charge that he was not troubled when faced with the prospect of war and death for thousands, turned his search for undisputed rule into a series of conflicts throughout Europe and ignored treaties and conventions alike. His role in the [[Haitian Revolution]] and decision to reinstate slavery in France's overseas colonies are controversial and affect his reputation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Repa |first=Jan |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4491668.stm |title=Furore over Austerlitz ceremony |publisher=BBC |date=2 December 2005 |accessdate=5 April 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100420234710/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4491668.stm |archivedate=20 April 2010  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Napoleon institutionalised plunder of conquered territories: French museums contain art stolen by Napoleon's forces from across Europe. Artefacts were brought to the [[Musée du Louvre]] for a grand central museum; his example would later serve as inspiration for more notorious imitators.&lt;ref&gt;Poulos 2000&lt;/ref&gt; He was compared to [[Adolf Hitler]] most famously by the historian [[Pieter Geyl]] in 1947&lt;ref&gt;Geyl 1947&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Claude Ribbe]] in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;Philip Dwyer, "Remembering and Forgetting in Contemporary France: Napoleon, Slavery, and the French History Wars", ''French Politics, Culture &amp; Society'' (2008) 26#3. pp. 110–122. [http://web.ebscohost.com/ehost/viewarticle?data=dGJyMPPp44rp2%2fdV0%2bnjisfk5Ie42eqLtaashd%2ff7Ebj3u2L8ravSq2otEewpq9Lnq64SrewsFCet8s%2b8ujfhvHX4Yzn5eyB4rOrSbSptUmyqLdMt5zqeezdu33snOJ6u97neaTq33%2b7t8w%2b3%2bS7S7Ovs0mxp7Q%2b5OXwhd%2fqu4ji3MSN6uLSffbq&amp;hid=4207 online]&lt;/ref&gt; [[David G. Chandler]], a foremost historian of Napoleonic warfare, wrote in 1973 that, "Nothing could be more degrading to the former [Napoleon] and more flattering to the latter [Hitler]. The comparison is odious. On the whole Napoleon was inspired by a noble dream, wholly dissimilar from Hitler's&amp;nbsp;... Napoleon left great and lasting testimonies to his genius—in codes of law and national identities which survive to the present day. Adolf Hitler left nothing but destruction."&lt;ref&gt;Chandler 1973, p. xliii&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics argue Napoleon's true legacy must reflect the loss of status for France and needless deaths brought by his rule: historian [[Victor Davis Hanson]] writes, "After all, the military record is unquestioned—17 years of wars, perhaps [[Napoleonic Wars casualties|six million Europeans dead]], France bankrupt, her overseas colonies lost."&lt;ref&gt;Hanson 2003&lt;/ref&gt; McLynn states that, "He can be viewed as the man who set back European economic life for a generation by the dislocating impact of his wars."&lt;ref name="M666" /&gt; [[Vincent Cronin]] replies that such criticism relies on the flawed premise that Napoleon was responsible for the wars which bear his name, when in fact France was the victim of a series of coalitions which aimed to destroy the ideals of the Revolution.&lt;ref name="c342"&gt;Cronin 1994, pp. 342–43&lt;/ref&gt;

British military historian [[Correlli Barnett]] calls him 'a social misfit' who exploited France for his personal megalomaniac goals. He says Napoleon's reputation is exaggerated.&lt;ref&gt;Correlli Barnett, ''Bonaparte'' (1978)&lt;/ref&gt;  French scholar [[Jean Tulard]] provided an influential of his image as a savior.&lt;ref&gt;Jean Tulard, ''Napoleon: The Myth of the Saviour'' (1984), &lt;/ref&gt;  Louis Bergeron has praised the numerous changes he made to French society, especially regarding the law as well as education.&lt;ref&gt;See {cite book|author=Bergeron, Louis |title=France Under Napoleon|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=rqe1UU6OiIUC&amp;pg=PR9|year=1981|publisher=Princeton U.P.|isbn=0691007896}}&lt;/ref&gt;  His greatest failure was the Russian invasion.  Many historians have blamed Napoleon's poor planning, but Russian scholars instead emphasize the Russian response, noting the notorious winter weather was just as hard on the defenders.&lt;ref&gt;See [[Dominic Lieven]],  "Review article: Russia and the defeat of Napoleon." ''Kritika: Explorations in Russian and Eurasian History'' (2006) 7#2 pp: 283-308.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Propaganda and memory ===
{{Main|Napoleonic propaganda}}
{{double image|right|Jacques Louis David - Bonaparte franchissant le Grand Saint-Bernard, 20 mai 1800 - Google Art Project.jpg|220|Paul Delaroche - Napoleon Crossing the Alps - Google Art Project 2.jpg|200|''[[Napoleon Crossing the Alps]]'', [[Romanticism|romantic]] version by [[Jacques-Louis David]] in 1805|''[[Bonaparte Crossing the Alps]]'', [[Realism (art movement)|realist]] version by [[Paul Delaroche]] in 1848}}

Napoleon's use of propaganda contributed to his rise to power, legitimated his régime, and established his image for posterity. Strict censorship, controlling aspects of the press, books, theater, and art, was part of his propaganda scheme, aimed at portraying him as bringing desperately wanted peace and stability to France. The propagandistic rhetoric changed in relation to events and to the atmosphere of Napoleon's reign, focusing first on his role as a general in the army and identification as a soldier, and moving to his role as emperor and a civil leader. Specifically targeting his civilian audience, Napoleon fostered a relationship with the contemporary art community, taking an active role in commissioning and controlling different forms of art production to suit his propaganda goals.&lt;ref&gt;Alan Forrest, "Propaganda and the Legitimation of Power in Napoleonic France". ''French History'', 2004 18(4): 426–445&lt;/ref&gt;

Hazareesingh (2004) explores how Napoleon's image and memory are best understood. They played a key role in collective political defiance of the Bourbon restoration monarchy in 1815–1830. People from different walks of life and areas of France, particularly Napoleonic veterans, drew on the Napoleonic legacy and its connections with the ideals of the 1789 revolution.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Sudhir Hazareesingh, "Memory and Political Imagination: the Legend of Napoleon Revisited". ''French History'', 2004 18(4): 463–483&lt;/ref&gt;

Widespread rumors of Napoleon's return from St. Helena and Napoleon as an inspiration for patriotism, individual and collective liberties, and political mobilization manifested themselves in seditious materials, displaying the tricolor and rosettes. There were also subversive activities celebrating anniversaries of Napoleon's life and reign and disrupting royal celebrations—they demonstrated the prevailing and successful goal of the varied supporters of Napoleon to constantly destabilize the Bourbon regime.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;

Datta (2005) shows that, following the collapse of militaristic [[Boulangism]] in the late 1880s, the Napoleonic legend was divorced from party politics and revived in popular culture. Concentrating on two plays and two novels from the period—[[Victorien Sardou]]'s ''Madame Sans-Gêne'' (1893), [[Maurice Barrès]]'s ''Les Déracinés'' (1897), [[Edmond Rostand]]'s ''L'Aiglon'' (1900), and [[André de Lorde]] and [[Sibylle Gabrielle Marie Antoinette Riqueti de Mirabeau|Gyp]]'s ''Napoléonette'' (1913)—Datta examines how writers and critics of the ''[[Belle Époque]]'' exploited the Napoleonic legend for diverse political and cultural ends.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Venita Datta, "'L'appel Au Soldat': Visions of the Napoleonic Legend in Popular Culture of the Belle Epoque". ''French Historical Studies'' 2005 28(1): 1–30&lt;/ref&gt;

Reduced to a minor character, the new fictional Napoleon became not a world historical figure but an intimate one, fashioned by individuals' needs and consumed as popular entertainment. In their attempts to represent the emperor as a figure of national unity, proponents and detractors of the Third Republic used the legend as a vehicle for exploring anxieties about gender and fears about the processes of democratization that accompanied this new era of mass politics and culture.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB" /&gt;

International Napoleonic Congresses take place regularly, with participation by members of the French and American military, French politicians and scholars from different countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.napoleon.org/en/magazine/presse_review/files/dinard_callforpapers.asp |title=Call for Papers: International Napoleonic Society, Fourth International Napoleonic Congress |accessdate=27 June 2008 |publisher=La Fondation Napoléon |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090108025218/http://www.napoleon.org/en/magazine/presse_review/files/dinard_callforpapers.asp |archivedate=8 January 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2012, the [[Mayor (France)|mayor]] of [[Montereau-Fault-Yonne]], near Paris—the site of a [[Battle of Montereau|late victory]] of Napoleon—proposed development of [[Napoleonland|Napoleon's Bivouac]], a commemorative theme park at a projected cost of 200 million euros.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.napoleon.org/en%5Creading_room%5Carticles%5Cfiles%5C480813.asp |title=A New Napoleonic Campaign for Montereau |first=Ottavi |last=Laurent |publisher=Foundation Napoleon |date=8 February 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130929024236/http://www.napoleon.org/en/reading_room/articles/files/480813.asp |archivedate=29 September 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Long-term influence outside France ===

[[File:Napoleon on the Capitol.jpg|thumb|upright|[[commons:Bas-reliefs in the chamber of the United States House of Representatives|Bas-relief]] of Napoleon I in the chamber of the [[United States House of Representatives]]]]
Napoleon was responsible for spreading the values of the French Revolution to other countries, especially in legal reform and the abolition of serfdom.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander Grab, ''Napoleon and the Transformation of Europe'' (Macmillan, 2003), country by country analysis&lt;/ref&gt;

After the fall of Napoleon, not only was the Napoleonic Code retained by conquered countries including the Netherlands, Belgium, parts of Italy and Germany, but has been used as the basis of certain parts of law outside Europe including the Dominican Republic, the US state of Louisiana and the Canadian province of Quebec.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/403196/Napoleonic-Code|title=Napoleonic Code|work=Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate=13 April 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111229185548/http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/403196/Napoleonic-Code|archivedate=29 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The memory of Napoleon in Poland is favorable, for his support for independence and opposition to Russia, his legal code, the abolition of serfdom, and the introduction of modern middle class bureaucracies.&lt;ref&gt;Andrzej Nieuwazny, "Napoleon and Polish identity". ''History Today'', May 1998 vol. 48 no. 5 pp. 50–55&lt;/ref&gt;

Napoleon could be considered one of the founders of modern Germany. After dissolving the [[Holy Roman Empire]], he reduced the number of German states from 300 to less than 50, prior to [[Unification of Germany|German Unification]]. A byproduct of the French occupation was a strong development in [[German nationalism]]. Napoleon also significantly aided the United States when he agreed to [[Louisiana Purchase|sell]] the territory of Louisiana for 15 million dollars during the presidency of [[Thomas Jefferson]]. That territory almost doubled the size of the United States, adding the equivalent of 13 states to the Union.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|McGRAW-HILL's, US History|2012|pp=112–113}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Marriages and children ==

Napoleon married [[Joséphine de Beauharnais]] in 1796, when he was 26; she was a 32-year-old widow whose first husband had been executed during the Revolution. Five days after [[Joséphine de Beauharnais|Joséphine's]] first husband’s death, the Reign of Terror initiator Maximilien de Robespierre was executed, and, with the help of high-placed friends, [[Joséphine de Beauharnais|Joséphine]] was freed. &lt;ref&gt;{{title=Biography of Joesephine de Beauharnais |url=https://www.biography.com/people/jos%C3%A9phine-de-beauharnais-9358328}}&lt;/ref&gt; Until she met Bonaparte, she had been known as "Rose", a name which he disliked. He called her "Joséphine" instead, and she went by this name henceforth. Bonaparte often sent her love letters while on his campaigns.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|McLynn|1998|p=117}}&lt;/ref&gt; He formally adopted her son [[Eugène de Beauharnais|Eugène]] and cousin [[Stéphanie de Beauharnais|Stéphanie]] and arranged dynastic marriages for them. Joséphine had her daughter [[Hortense de Beauharnais|Hortense]] marry Napoleon's brother [[Louis Bonaparte|Louis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|McLynn|1998|p=271}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Joséphine had lovers, such as Lieutenant Hippolyte Charles, during Napoleon's Italian campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|McLynn|1998|p=118}}&lt;/ref&gt; Napoleon learnt of that affair and a letter he wrote about it was intercepted by the British and published widely, to embarrass Napoleon. Napoleon had his own affairs too: during the Egyptian campaign he took Pauline Bellisle Foures, the wife of a junior officer, as his mistress. She became known as "Cleopatra".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|McLynn|1998|p=188}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{#tag:ref|One night, during an illicit liaison with the actress Marguerite George, Napoleon had a major fit. This and other more minor attacks have led historians to debate whether he had epilepsy and, if so, to what extent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|McLynn|1998|p=284}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=note}}

While Napoleon's mistresses had children by him, Joséphine did not produce an heir, possibly because of either the stresses of her imprisonment during the [[Reign of Terror]] or an abortion she may have had in her twenties.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|McLynn|1998|p=100}}&lt;/ref&gt; Napoleon chose divorce so he could remarry in search of an heir. Despite his divorce from Josephine, Napoleon showed his dedication to her for the rest of his life. When he heard the news of her death while on exile in Elba, he locked himself in his room and would not come out for two full days.&lt;ref name="pbs.org"/&gt; Her name would also be his final word on his deathbed in 1821.

On 11 March 1810 by [[proxy marriage|proxy]], he married the 19-year-old [[Marie Louise, Duchess of Parma|Marie Louise]], Archduchess of Austria, and a great niece of [[Marie Antoinette]].  Thus he had married into a [[Family tree of the German monarchs|German royal and imperial family]].&lt;ref name="McLynn 1998, p.663"&gt;{{Harvnb|McLynn|1998|p=663}}&lt;/ref&gt; Louise was less than happy with the arrangement, at least at first, stating: "Just to see the man would be the worst form of torture". Her great-aunt had been executed in France, while Napoleon had fought numerous campaigns against Austria all throughout his military career. However, she seemed to warm up to him over time. After her wedding, she wrote to her father: "He loves me very much. I respond to his love sincerely. There is something very fetching and very eager about him that is impossible to resist".&lt;ref name="pbs.org"/&gt;

Napoleon and Marie Louise remained married until his death, though she did not join him in exile on Elba and thereafter never saw her husband again. The couple had one child, [[Napoleon II|Napoleon Francis Joseph Charles]] (1811–1832), known from birth as the [[King of the Romans|King of Rome]]. He became Napoleon II in 1814 and reigned for only two weeks. He was awarded the title of the Duke of Reichstadt in 1818 and died of [[tuberculosis]] aged 21, with no children.&lt;ref name="McLynn 1998, p.663" /&gt;

Napoleon acknowledged one illegitimate son: [[Charles Léon]] (1806–1881) by [[Eléonore Denuelle de La Plaigne]].&lt;ref name="m630"&gt;{{Harvnb|McLynn|1998|p=630}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alexandre Colonna-Walewski]] (1810–1868), the son of his mistress [[Maria Walewska]], although acknowledged by Walewska's husband, was also widely known to be his child, and the DNA of his direct male descendant has been used to help confirm Napoleon's [[Haplotype#Y-DNA haplotypes from genealogical DNA tests|Y-chromosome haplotype]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lucotte |first1=Gérard |last2=Macé |first2=Jacques |last3=Hrechdakian |first3=Peter |last-author-amp=yes |journal=International Journal of Sciences |volume=2 |number=9 |pages=127–139 |url=http://www.ijsciences.com/pub/pdf/V220130935.pdf |title=Reconstruction of the Lineage Y Chromosome Haplotype of Napoléon the First |date=September 2013 |issn=2305-3925 |publisher=Alkhaer Publications |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140406223823/http://www.ijsciences.com/pub/pdf/V220130935.pdf |archivedate=6 April 2014  }}&lt;/ref&gt; He may have had further unacknowledged illegitimate offspring as well, such as [[Eugen Megerle von Mühlfeld]] by [[Emilie Victoria Kraus von Wolfsberg|Emilie Victoria Kraus]]&lt;ref name="McLynn423"&gt;{{Harvnb|McLynn|1998|p=423}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Hélène Napoleone Bonaparte]] (1816–1907) by [[Albine de Montholon]].

The '''network probability matrix''' describes the probability structure of a network based on the historical presence or absence of edges in a network.  For example, individuals in a social network are not connected to other individuals with [[discrete uniform distribution|uniform random]] probability.  The probability structure is much more complex.  Intuitively, there are some people whom a person will communicate with or be connected more closely than others.  For this reason, real-world networks tend to have clusters or cliques of nodes that are more closely related than others (Albert and Barabasi, 2002, Carley [year], Newmann 2003).  This can be simulated by varying the probabilities that certain nodes will communicate. The network probability matrix was originally proposed by Ian McCulloh.

'''Parallel coordinates''' are a common way of visualizing [[high-dimensional]] [[geometry]] and analyzing [[multivariate data]].

To show a set of [[point (geometry)|points]] in an [[n-dimensional space|''n''-dimensional space]], a backdrop is drawn consisting of ''n'' [[parallel (geometry)|parallel]] lines, typically vertical and equally spaced. A point in ''n''-dimensional space is represented as a [[polyline]] with [[vertex (geometry)|vertices]] on the parallel axes; the position of the vertex on the ''i''-th axis corresponds to the ''i''-th [[coordinate]] of the point.

This visualization is closely related to [[time series]] visualization, except that it is applied to data where the axes do not correspond to points in time, and therefore do not have a natural order. Therefore, different axis arrangements may be of interest.

== History ==

Parallel coordinates were often said to be invented by [[Philbert Maurice d'Ocagne]] [[:fr:Maurice d'Ocagne|(fr)]] in 1885,&lt;ref name="pc-first"&gt;{{cite book |last=d'Ocagne |first=Maurice |year=1885 |title=Coordonnées parallèles et axiales : Méthode de transformation géométrique et procédé nouveau de calcul graphique déduits de la considération des coordonnées parallèles |publisher=Paris: Gauthier-Villars |url=https://archive.org/details/coordonnesparal00ocaggoog }}&lt;/ref&gt; but even though the words "Coordonnées parallèles" appear in the book title this work has nothing to do with the visualization techniques of the same name; the book only describes a method of coordinate transformation. But even before 1885, parallel coordinates were used, for example in Henry Gannetts "General Summary, Showing the Rank of States, by Ratios, 1880",&lt;ref name="hg"&gt;{{cite journal |first=Henry |last=Gannett |title=General Summary Showing the Rank of States by Ratios 1880 |url=http://www.davidrumsey.com/luna/servlet/detail/RUMSEY~8~1~32803~1152181:General-summary,-showing-the-rank-o?sort=Pub_Date%2CPub_List_No_InitialSort&amp;qvq=q:List_No%3D%274521.152%27%22%2B;sort:Pub_Date%2CPub_List_No_InitialSort;lc:RUMSEY~8~1&amp;mi=0&amp;trs=1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or afterwards in Henry Gannetts "Rank of States and Territories in Population at Each Census, 1790-1890" in 1898. They were  popularised again 79 years later by [[Alfred Inselberg]] &lt;ref name="pc"&gt;{{cite journal |first=Alfred |last=Inselberg |title=The Plane with Parallel Coordinates |journal=Visual Computer |volume=1 |issue=4 |pages=69–91 |year=1985 |doi=10.1007/BF01898350 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1959 and systematically developed as a coordinate system starting from 1977. Some important applications are in [[Traffic collision avoidance system|collision avoidance algorithms]] for [[air traffic control]] (1987—3 USA patents), [[data mining]] (USA patent), [[computer vision]] (USA patent), Optimization, [[process control]], more recently in [[Intrusion detection system|intrusion detection]] and elsewhere.

==Higher dimensions==
On the plane with an xy cartesian coordinate system, adding more [[dimensions]] in parallel coordinates (often abbreviated ||-coords or PCP) involves adding more axes. The value of parallel coordinates is that certain geometrical properties in high dimensions transform into easily seen 2D patterns. For example, a set of points on a line in ''n''-space transforms to a set of [[polyline]]s in parallel coordinates all intersecting at ''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1 points. For ''n'' = 2 this yields a point-line duality pointing out why the mathematical foundations of parallel coordinates are developed in the [[Projective space|projective]] rather than [[Euclidian space|euclidean]] space. A pair of lines intersects at a unique point which has two coordinates and, therefore, can correspond to a unique line which is also specified by two parameters (or two points). By contrast, more than two points are required to specify a curve and also a pair of curves may not have a unique intersection. Hence by using curves in parallel coordinates instead of lines, the point line duality is lost together with all the other properties of projective geometry, and the known nice higher-dimensional patterns corresponding to (hyper)planes, curves, several smooth (hyper)surfaces, proximities, convexity and recently non-orientability.&lt;ref name="pc2"&gt;{{cite book |first=Alfred |last=Inselberg |title=Parallel Coordinates: VISUAL Multidimensional Geometry and its Applications |publisher=Springer |year=2009 |isbn=978-0387215075 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The goal is to map n-dimensional relations into 2D patterns. Hence, parallel coordinates is not a point-to-point mapping but rather a ''n''D subset to 2D subset mapping, there is no loss of information. Note: even a point in nD is not mapped into a point in 2D, but to a polygonal line—a subset of 2D.

==Statistical considerations==
[[File:Parallel coordinates-sample.png|thumb|Representative sample for parallel coordinates.]]
When used for statistical data visualisation there are three important considerations: the order, the rotation, and the scaling of the axes.

The order of the axes is critical for finding features, and in typical data analysis many reorderings will need to be tried.  Some authors have come up with ordering heuristics which may create illuminating orderings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Jing |last1=Yang |first2=Wei |last2=Peng |first3=Matthew O. |last3=Ward |first4=Elke A. |last4=Rundensteiner |year=2003 |url=http://davis.wpi.edu/~xmdv/docs/tr0313_osf.pdf |title=Interactive Hierarchical Dimension Ordering Spacing and Filtering for Exploration of High Dimensional Datasets |pages=3–4 |journal=IEEE Symposium on Information Visualization (INFOVIS 2003) }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The rotation of the axes is a translation in the parallel coordinates and if the lines intersected outside the parallel axes it can be translated between them by rotations. The simplest example of this is rotating the axis by 180 degrees.&lt;ref name="Gpc2" /&gt;

Scaling is necessary because the plot is based on interpolation (linear combination) of consecutive pairs of variables.&lt;ref name="Gpc2"&gt;{{cite book |first1=Rida |last1=Moustafa |first2=Edward J. |last2=Wegman |chapter=Multivariate continuous data – Parallel Coordinates |editors= Unwin, A.; Theus, M.; and Hofmann, H. (Eds.) |title=Graphics of Large Datasets: Visualizing a Million |publisher=Springer |pages=143–156 |year=2006 |isbn=978-0387329062 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, the variables must be in common scale, and there are many scaling methods to be considered as part of data preparation process that can reveal more informative views.

A smooth parallel coordinate plot is achieved with splines.&lt;ref name="Gpc1"&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Rida |last1=Moustafa |first2=Edward J. |last2=Wegman |title=On Some Generalizations of Parallel Coordinate Plots |journal=Seeing a million, A Data Visualization Workshop, Rain am Lech (nr.), Germany |year=2002 |url=http://herakles.zcu.cz/seminars/docs/infovis/papers/Moustafa_generalized_parallel_coordinates.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131224111246/http://herakles.zcu.cz/seminars/docs/infovis/papers/Moustafa_generalized_parallel_coordinates.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2013-12-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the smooth plot, every observation is mapped into a parametric line (or curve), which is smooth, continuous on the axes, and orthogonal to each parallel axis. This design emphasizes the quantization level for each data attribute.&lt;ref name="Gpc2" /&gt; If one uses the Fourier interpolation of degree equals to the data dimensionality, then an [[Andrews plot]]&lt;ref name="Adws72"&gt;
{{cite journal |first=David F. |last=Andrews |title=Plots of High-Dimensional Data |journal=International Biometric Society |volume=18 |issue=1 |pages=125–136 |year=1972 |jstor=2528964 }}&lt;/ref&gt; is achieved.

== Reading ==
Inselberg ({{harvnb|Inselberg|1997|p= }}) made a full review of how to visually read out parallel coords' relational patterns.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last1=Inselberg |first1=A.|year=1997 |chapter=Multidimensional detective |editor=|title=Information Visualization, 1997. Proceedings., IEEE Symposium on |series=|isbn=|publisher=|place=|pages=100–107|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpls/abs_all.jsp?arnumber=636793}}&lt;/ref&gt; When most lines between two parallel axis are somewhat parallel to each others, that suggests a positive relationship between these two dimensions. When lines cross in a kind of superposition of X-shapes, that's negative relationship. When lines cross randomly  or are parallel, that show there is no particular relationship.

== Limitations ==
In parallel coordinates, each axis can have at most two neighboring axes (one on the left, and one on the right). For a d-dimensional data set, at most d-1 relationships can be shown at a time. In [[time series]] visualization, there exists a natural predecessor and successor; therefore in this special case, there exists a preferred arrangement. However, when the axes do not have a unique order, finding a good axis arrangement requires the use of heuristics and experimentation. In order to explore more complex relationships, axes must be reordered.

By arranging the axes in 3-dimensional space (however, still in parallel, like nails in a nail bed), an axis can have more than two neighbors in a circle around the central attribute, and the arrangement problem gets easier (for example by using a [[minimum spanning tree]]).&lt;ref name="sigmod13"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Interactive Data Mining with 3D-Parallel-Coordinate-Trees

== Software ==
While there are a large number of papers about parallel coordinates, there are only few notable software publicly available to convert databases into parallel coordinates graphics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eagereyes.org/techniques/parallel-coordinates|title=Parallel Coordinates|last=Kosara|first=Robert|year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Notable software are [[ELKI]], [[GGobi]], [[Macrofocus High-D]], [[Mondrian data analysis|Mondrian]], [[Orange (software)|Orange]] and [[ROOT]].

&lt;/ref&gt;]]
In [[physics]] and [[mathematics]], a '''pseudovector''' (or '''axial vector''') is a quantity that transforms like a [[vector (geometry)|vector]] under a proper [[Rotation (mathematics)|rotation]], but in three dimensions gains an additional sign flip under an [[improper rotation]] such as a [[reflection (mathematics)|reflection]]. Geometrically it is the opposite, of equal magnitude but in the opposite direction, of its [[mirror image]]. This is as opposed to a ''true'' vector, also known, in this context, as a '''polar vector''', which on reflection matches its mirror image.

In three dimensions, the pseudovector '''p''' is associated  with the [[curl (mathematics)|curl]] of a polar vector or with the [[cross product]] of two  polar vectors '''a''' and '''b''':&lt;ref name=Tarapov&gt;
{{cite book |title=Vector and tensor analysis with applications |author1=Aleksandr Ivanovich Borisenko |author2=Ivan Evgenʹevich Tarapov |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CRIjIx2ac6AC&amp;pg=PA125&amp;dq=%22C+is+a+pseudovector.+Note+that%22&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=%22C%20is%20a%20pseudovector.%20Note%20that%22&amp;f=false |page=125 |isbn=0-486-63833-2 |year=1979 |edition=Reprint of 1968 Prentice-Hall |publisher=Courier Dover}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

The vector '''p''' calculated this way is a pseudovector. One example is the normal to an oriented [[plane (geometry)|plane]]. An oriented plane can be defined by two non-parallel vectors, '''a''' and '''b''',&lt;ref name=FeynmanLectures&gt;
[http://www.feynmanlectures.caltech.edu/I_52.html RP Feynman: §52-5 Polar and axial vectors, Feynman Lectures in Physics, Vol. 1]&lt;/ref&gt; that span the plane. The vector {{nowrap|'''a''' × '''b'''}} is a normal to the plane (there are two normals, one on each side – the [[right-hand rule]] will determine which), and is a pseudovector. This has consequences in computer graphics where it has to be considered when [[Surface normal#Transforming normals|transforming surface normals]].

A number of quantities in physics behave as pseudovectors rather than polar vectors, including [[magnetic field]] and [[angular velocity]]. In mathematics pseudovectors are equivalent to three-dimensional [[bivector]]s, from which the transformation rules of pseudovectors can be derived. More generally in ''n''-dimensional [[geometric algebra]] pseudovectors are the elements of the algebra with dimension {{nowrap|''n'' − 1}}, written ⋀&lt;sup&gt;''n''−1&lt;/sup&gt;'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;. The label "pseudo" can be further generalized to [[pseudoscalar]]s and [[pseudotensor]]s, both of which gain an extra sign flip under improper rotations compared to a true [[scalar (mathematics)|scalar]] or [[tensor]].

==Physical examples==
Physical examples of pseudovectors include [[magnetic field]], [[torque]], [[angular velocity]], and [[angular momentum]].

[[Image:Impulsmoment van autowiel onder inversie.svg|thumb|Each wheel of a car driving away from an observer has an angular momentum pseudovector pointing left. The same is true for the mirror image of the car.]]

Consider the pseudovector [[angular momentum]] {{nowrap|1='''L''' = '''r''' × '''p'''}}. Driving in a car, and looking forward, each of the wheels has an angular momentum vector pointing to the left. If the world is reflected in a mirror which switches the left and right side of the car, the "reflection" of this angular momentum "vector" (viewed as an ordinary vector) points to the right, but the ''actual'' angular momentum vector of the wheel (which is still turning forward in the reflection) still points to the left, corresponding to the extra minus sign in the reflection of a pseudovector.

The distinction between vectors and pseudovectors becomes important in understanding [[Symmetry in physics|the effect of symmetry on the solution to physical systems]]. Consider an electric current loop in the {{nowrap|1=''z'' = 0}} plane that inside the loop generates a magnetic field oriented in the ''z'' direction. This system is [[symmetric]] (invariant) under mirror reflections through this plane, with the magnetic field unchanged by the reflection. But reflecting the magnetic field as a vector through that plane would be expected to reverse it; this expectation is corrected by realizing that the magnetic field is a pseudovector, with the extra sign flip leaving it unchanged.

==Details==
{{see also|Covariance and contravariance of vectors|Euclidean vector}}

The definition of a "vector" in physics (including both polar vectors and pseudovectors) is more specific than the mathematical definition of "vector" (namely, any element of an abstract [[vector space]]). Under the physics definition, a "vector" is required to have [[tuple|components]] that "transform" in a certain way under a [[rotation (mathematics)|proper rotation]]: In particular, if everything in the universe were rotated, the vector would rotate in exactly the same way. (The coordinate system is fixed in this discussion; in other words this is the perspective of [[active and passive transformation|active transformations]].) Mathematically, if everything in the universe undergoes a rotation described by a [[rotation matrix]] ''R'', so that a [[displacement vector]] '''x''' is transformed to {{nowrap|1='''x'''′ = ''R'''''x'''}}, then any "vector" '''v''' must be similarly transformed to {{nowrap|1='''v'''′ = ''R'''''v'''}}. This important requirement is what distinguishes a ''vector'' (which might be composed of, for example, the ''x''-, ''y''-, and ''z''-components of [[velocity]]) from any other triplet of physical quantities (For example, the length, width, and height of a rectangular box ''cannot'' be considered the three components of a vector, since rotating the box does not appropriately transform these three components.)

(In the language of [[differential geometry]], this requirement is equivalent to defining a ''vector'' to be a [[tensor]] of [[Covariance and contravariance of vectors|contravariant]] rank one.)

The discussion so far only relates to proper rotations, i.e. rotations about an axis. However, one can also consider [[improper rotation]]s, i.e. a mirror-reflection possibly followed by a proper rotation. (One example of an improper rotation is [[inversion through a point]] in 3-dimensional space.) Suppose everything in the universe undergoes an improper rotation described by the rotation matrix ''R'', so that a position vector '''x''' is transformed to {{nowrap|1='''x'''′ = ''R'''''x'''}}. If the vector '''v''' is a polar vector, it will be transformed to {{nowrap|1='''v'''′ = ''R'''''v'''}}. If it is a pseudovector, it will be transformed to {{nowrap|1='''v'''′ = −''R'''''v'''}}.

The transformation rules for polar vectors and pseudovectors can be compactly stated as

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\mathbf{v}' &amp; = R\mathbf{v} &amp; &amp; \text{(polar vector)} \\
\mathbf{v}' &amp; = (\det R)(R\mathbf{v}) &amp; &amp; \text{(pseudovector)}
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

where the symbols are as described above, and the rotation matrix ''R'' can be either proper or improper. The symbol det denotes [[determinant]]; this formula works because the determinant of proper and improper rotation matrices are +1 and −1, respectively.

===Behavior under addition, subtraction, scalar multiplication===

Suppose '''v'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and '''v'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are known pseudovectors, and '''v'''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; is defined to be their sum, {{nowrap|1='''v'''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; = '''v'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + '''v'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}}. If the universe is transformed by a rotation matrix ''R'', then '''v'''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; is transformed to

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\mathbf{v_3}' = \mathbf{v_1}'+\mathbf{v_2}' &amp; = (\det R)(R\mathbf{v_1}) + (\det R)(R\mathbf{v_2}) \\
&amp; = (\det R)(R(\mathbf{v_1}+\mathbf{v_2}))=(\det R)(R\mathbf{v_3}).
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

So '''v'''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; is also a pseudovector. Similarly one can show that the difference between two pseudovectors is a pseudovector, that the sum or difference of two polar vectors is a polar vector, that multiplying a polar vector by any real number yields another polar vector, and that multiplying a pseudovector by any real number yields another pseudovector.

On the other hand, suppose '''v'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is known to be a polar vector, '''v'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is known to be a pseudovector, and '''v'''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; is defined to be their sum, {{nowrap|1='''v'''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; = '''v'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + '''v'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}}. If the universe is transformed by a rotation matrix ''R'', then '''v'''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; is transformed to

: &lt;math&gt;
\mathbf{v_3}' = \mathbf{v_1}'+\mathbf{v_2}' = (R\mathbf{v_1}) + (\det R)(R\mathbf{v_2}) = R(\mathbf{v_1}+(\det R) \mathbf{v_2}).
&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore, '''v'''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; is neither a polar vector nor a pseudovector. For an improper rotation, '''v'''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; does not in general even keep the same magnitude:

: &lt;math&gt;|\mathbf{v_3}| = |\mathbf{v_1}+\mathbf{v_2}|, \text{ but } |\mathbf{v_3}'| = |\mathbf{v_1}'-\mathbf{v_2}'|&lt;/math&gt;.

If the magnitude of '''v'''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; were to describe a measurable physical quantity, that would mean that the laws of physics would not appear the same if the universe was viewed in a mirror. In fact, this is exactly what happens in the [[weak interaction]]: Certain radioactive decays treat "left" and "right" differently, a phenomenon which can be traced to the summation of a polar vector with a pseudovector in the underlying theory. (See [[parity violation]].)

===Behavior under cross products===

[[Image:Uitwendig product onder inversie.svg|thumb|Under inversion the two vectors change sign, but their cross product is invariant [black are the two original vectors, grey are the inverted vectors, and red is their mutual cross product].]]
For a rotation matrix ''R'', either proper or improper, the following mathematical equation is always true:
:&lt;math&gt;(R\mathbf{v_1})\times(R\mathbf{v_2}) = (\det R)(R(\mathbf{v_1}\times\mathbf{v_2}))&lt;/math&gt;,
where '''v'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and '''v'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are any three-dimensional vectors. (This equation can be proven either through a geometric argument or through an algebraic calculation.)

Suppose '''v'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and '''v'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are known polar vectors, and '''v'''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; is defined to be their cross product, {{nowrap|1='''v'''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; = '''v'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; × '''v'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}}. If the universe is transformed by a rotation matrix ''R'', then '''v'''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; is transformed to
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v_3}' = \mathbf{v_1}' \times \mathbf{v_2}' = (R\mathbf{v_1}) \times (R\mathbf{v_2}) = (\det R)(R(\mathbf{v_1} \times \mathbf{v_2}))=(\det R)(R\mathbf{v_3}).&lt;/math&gt;
So '''v'''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; is a pseudovector. Similarly, one can show:
*polar vector × polar vector = pseudovector
*pseudovector × pseudovector = pseudovector
*polar vector × pseudovector = polar vector
*pseudovector × polar vector = polar vector
This is isomorphic to addition modulo&amp;nbsp;2, where "polar" corresponds to 1 and "pseudo" to&amp;nbsp;0.

===Examples===

From the definition, it is clear that a displacement vector is a polar vector. The velocity vector is a displacement vector (a polar vector) divided by time (a scalar), so is also a polar vector. Likewise, the momentum vector is the velocity vector (a polar vector) times mass (a scalar), so is a polar vector. Angular momentum is the cross product of a displacement (a polar vector) and momentum (a polar vector), and is therefore a pseudovector. Continuing this way, it is straightforward to classify any vector as either a pseudovector or polar vector.

==The right-hand rule==

Above, pseudovectors have been discussed using [[Active and passive transformation|active transformation]]s. An alternate approach, more along the lines of [[Active and passive transformation|passive transformation]]s, is to keep the universe fixed, but switch "[[right-hand rule]]" with "left-hand rule" everywhere in math and physics, including in the definition of the [[cross product]]. Any polar vector (e.g., a translation vector) would be unchanged, but pseudovectors (e.g., the magnetic field vector at a point) would switch signs. Nevertheless, there would be no physical consequences, apart from in the [[parity violation|parity-violating]] phenomena such as certain [[radioactive decay]]s.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.feynmanlectures.caltech.edu/I_52.html Feynman Lectures, 52-7, "Parity is not conserved!"].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Formalization==
One way to formalize pseudovectors is as follows: if ''V'' is an ''n''-[[dimension of a vector space|dimensional]] [[vector space]], then a ''pseudovector'' of ''V'' is an element of the (''n''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1)-th [[Exterior algebra#The exterior power|exterior power]] of ''V'': Λ&lt;sup&gt;''n''−1&lt;/sup&gt;(''V''). The pseudovectors of ''V'' form a vector space with the same dimension as ''V''.

This definition is not equivalent to that requiring a sign flip under improper rotations, but it is general to all vector spaces.  In particular,  when ''n'' is even, such a pseudovector does not experience a sign flip, and when the [[Characteristic (algebra)|characteristic]] of the underlying [[Field (mathematics)|field]] of ''V'' is 2, a sign flip has no effect. Otherwise, the definitions are equivalent, though it should be borne in mind that without additional structure (specifically, a [[volume form]]), there is no natural identification of ⋀&lt;sup&gt;''n''−1&lt;/sup&gt;(''V'') with ''V''.

==Geometric algebra==
In [[geometric algebra]] the basic elements are vectors, and these are used to build a hierarchy of elements using the definitions of products in this algebra. In particular, the algebra builds pseudovectors from vectors.

The basic multiplication in the geometric algebra is the [[geometric product]], denoted by simply juxtaposing two vectors as in '''ab'''. This product is expressed as:

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf {ab} = \mathbf {a \cdot b} +\mathbf {a \wedge b} \ , &lt;/math&gt;

where the leading term is the customary vector [[dot product]] and the second term is called the [[wedge product]]. Using the postulates of the algebra, all combinations of dot and wedge products can be evaluated. A terminology to describe the various combinations is provided. For example, a [[Multivector#Geometric algebra|multivector]] is a summation of ''k''-fold wedge products of various ''k''-values. A ''k''-fold wedge product also is referred to as a [[blade (geometry)|''k''-blade]].

In the present context the ''pseudovector'' is one of these combinations. This term is attached to a different multivector depending upon the [[dimension]]s of the space (that is, the number of [[linearly independent]] vectors in the space). In three dimensions, the most general 2-blade or [[bivector]] can be expressed as the wedge product of two vectors and is a pseudovector.&lt;ref name=Pezzaglia&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; In four dimensions, however, the pseudovectors are [[multivector|trivectors]].&lt;ref name=DeSabbata&gt;

In four dimensions, such as a [[Dirac algebra]], the pseudovectors are [[multivector|trivectors]]. {{cite book |title=Geometric algebra and applications to physics |author1=Venzo De Sabbata |author2=Bidyut Kumar Datta |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AXTQXnws8E8C&amp;pg=PA64&amp;dq=bivector+trivector+pseudovector+%22geometric+algebra%22&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=bivector%20trivector%20pseudovector%20%22geometric%20algebra%22&amp;f=false |isbn=1-58488-772-9 |year=2007 |page=64 |publisher=CRC Press}}

&lt;/ref&gt; In general, it is a {{nowrap|(''n'' − 1)}}-blade, where ''n'' is the dimension of the space and algebra.&lt;ref name=Baylis01&gt;

{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oaoLbMS3ErwC&amp;pg=PA100&amp;dq=%22pseudovectors+%28grade+n+-+1+elements%29%22&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=%22pseudovectors%20%28grade%20n%20-%201%20elements%29%22&amp;f=false |page=100 |author=William E Baylis |title=Lectures on Clifford (geometric) algebras and applications |isbn=0-8176-3257-3 |year=2004 |chapter=§4.2.3 Higher-grade multivectors in ''Cℓ''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;: Duals |publisher=Birkhäuser}}

&lt;/ref&gt; An ''n''-dimensional space has ''n'' basis vectors and also ''n'' basis pseudovectors. Each basis pseudovector is formed from the outer (wedge) product of all but one of the ''n'' basis vectors. For instance, in four dimensions where the basis vectors are taken to be {'''e'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;}, the pseudovectors can be written as: {'''e'''&lt;sub&gt;234&lt;/sub&gt;, '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;134&lt;/sub&gt;, '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;124&lt;/sub&gt;, '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;123&lt;/sub&gt;}.

===Transformations in three dimensions===
The transformation properties of the pseudovector in three dimensions has been compared to that of the [[vector cross product]] by Baylis.&lt;ref name=Baylis&gt;

{{cite book |author=William E Baylis |title=Theoretical methods in the physical sciences: an introduction to problem solving using Maple V |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pEfMq1sxWVEC&amp;pg=PA234 |page=234, see footnote |isbn=0-8176-3715-X |year=1994 |publisher=Birkhäuser}}

&lt;/ref&gt; He says: "The terms ''axial vector'' and ''pseudovector'' are often treated as synonymous, but it is quite useful to be able to distinguish a bivector from its dual." To paraphrase Baylis: Given two polar vectors (that is, true vectors) '''a''' and '''b''' in three dimensions, the cross product composed from '''a''' and '''b''' is the vector normal to their plane given by {{nowrap|1='''c''' = '''a''' × '''b'''}}. Given a set of right-handed orthonormal [[basis vector]]s {{nowrap|{ '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;ℓ&lt;/sub&gt; }&lt;nowiki/&gt;}}, the cross product is expressed in terms of its components as:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf {a} \times \mathbf{b} =  (a^2b^3 - a^3b^2) \mathbf {e}_1 + (a^3b^1 - a^1b^3) \mathbf {e}_2 + (a^1b^2 - a^2b^1) \mathbf {e}_3 ,&lt;/math&gt;

where superscripts label vector components. On the other hand, the plane of the two vectors is represented by the [[exterior product]] or wedge product, denoted by {{nowrap|'''a''' ∧ '''b'''}}. In this context of geometric algebra, this [[bivector]] is called a pseudovector, and is the ''[[Hodge dual]]'' of the cross product.&lt;ref name=Li&gt;

That is, the dual of '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is the subspace perpendicular to '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, namely the subspace spanned by '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. With this understanding,&lt;ref name=Perwass&gt;

For details, see ''{{section link|Hodge star operator|Three dimensions}}''. The cross product and wedge product are related by:

where ''i'' = {{nowrap|'''e'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ∧ '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ∧ '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;}} is called the ''[[Pseudoscalar (Clifford algebra)#Unit pseudoscalar|unit pseudoscalar]]''.&lt;ref name=Hestenes&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; It has the property:&lt;ref name=Sobczyk&gt;

{{cite book |title=Geometric algebra with applications in science and engineering |author1=Eduardo Bayro Corrochano |author2=Garret Sobczyk |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GVqz9-_fiLEC&amp;pg=PA126 |page=126 |isbn=0-8176-4199-8 |publisher=Springer |year=2001}}

&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\mathit{i}^2 = -1 \ . &lt;/math&gt;

Using the above relations, it is seen that if the vectors '''a''' and '''b''' are inverted by changing the signs of their components while leaving the basis vectors fixed, both the pseudovector and the cross product are invariant. On the other hand, if the components are fixed and the basis vectors '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;ℓ&lt;/sub&gt;  are inverted, then the pseudovector is invariant, but the cross product changes sign. This behavior of cross products is consistent with their definition as vector-like elements that change sign under transformation from a right-handed to a left-handed coordinate system, unlike polar vectors.

===Note on usage===
As an aside, it may be noted that not all authors in the field of geometric algebra use the term pseudovector, and some authors follow the terminology that does not distinguish between the pseudovector and the cross product.&lt;ref name=Jancewicz&gt;

For example, {{cite book |author=Bernard Jancewicz |title=Multivectors and Clifford algebra in electrodynamics |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=seFyL-UWoj4C&amp;pg=PA11#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false |page=11 |isbn=9971-5-0290-9 |year=1988 |publisher=World Scientific}}

&lt;/ref&gt; However, because the cross product does not generalize to other than three dimensions,&lt;ref name=Tischchenko1&gt;

{{cite book |title=Linearity and the mathematics of several variables |author1=Stephen A. Fulling |author2=Michael N. Sinyakov |author3=Sergei V. Tischchenko |page=340 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Eo3mcd_62DsC&amp;pg=RA1-PA340 |isbn=981-02-4196-8 |publisher=World Scientific |year=2000}}

&lt;/ref&gt;
the notion of pseudovector based upon the cross product also cannot be extended to a space of any other number of dimensions. The pseudovector as a {{nowrap|1=(''n'' – 1)}}-blade in an ''n''-dimensional space is not restricted in this way.

Another important note is that pseudovectors, despite their name, are "vectors" in the sense of being elements of a [[vector space]]. The idea that "a pseudovector is different from a vector" is only true with a different and more specific definition of the term "vector" as discussed above.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4418">In [[algebraic topology]], the '''pushforward''' of a [[continuous function]] &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; : &lt;math&gt;X \rightarrow Y&lt;/math&gt; between two [[topological space]]s is a [[homomorphism]]  &lt;math&gt;f_{*}:H_n\left(X\right) \rightarrow H_n\left(Y\right)&lt;/math&gt; between the [[homology group]]s for &lt;math&gt;n \geq 0&lt;/math&gt;.

Homology is a [[functor]] which converts a topological space &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; into a sequence of homology groups &lt;math&gt;H_{n}\left(X\right)&lt;/math&gt;. (Often, the collection of all such groups is referred to using the notation &lt;math&gt;H_{*}\left(X\right)&lt;/math&gt;; this collection has the structure of a [[graded ring]].) In any [[category (mathematics)|category]], a functor must induce a corresponding [[morphism]]. The pushforward is the morphism corresponding to the homology functor.

== Definition for singular and simplicial homology ==

We build the pushforward homomorphism as follows (for singular or simplicial homology):

First we have an induced homomorphism between the singular or simplicial [[chain complex]]   &lt;math&gt;C_n\left(X\right)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;C_n\left(Y\right)&lt;/math&gt; defined by composing each singular n-[[simplex]] &lt;math&gt;\sigma_X&lt;/math&gt; : &lt;math&gt;\Delta^n\rightarrow X&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; to obtain a singular n-simplex of &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;f_{\#}\left(\sigma_X\right) = f\sigma_X&lt;/math&gt; : &lt;math&gt;\Delta^n\rightarrow Y&lt;/math&gt;. Then we extend &lt;math&gt;f_{\#}&lt;/math&gt; linearly via &lt;math&gt;f_{\#}\left(\sum_tn_t\sigma_t\right) = \sum_tn_tf_{\#}\left(\sigma_t\right)&lt;/math&gt;.

The maps &lt;math&gt;f_{\#}&lt;/math&gt; : &lt;math&gt;C_n\left(X\right)\rightarrow C_n\left(Y\right)&lt;/math&gt; satisfy &lt;math&gt;f_{\#}\partial = \partial f_{\#}&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\partial&lt;/math&gt; is the [[boundary operator]] between chain groups, so &lt;math&gt;\partial f_{\#}&lt;/math&gt; defines a '''[[chain complex#Chain maps|chain map]]'''.

&lt;!-- We have a diagram
&lt;math&gt;
\[
\begin{array}{ccccccccc}
\dots &amp; \rightarrow &amp; C_{n+1}\left(X\right) &amp; \overset{\partial}{\rightarrow} &amp; C_{n}\left(X\right) &amp; \overset{\partial}{\rightarrow} &amp; C_{n-1}\left(X\right) &amp; \rightarrow &amp; \dots\\
 &amp;  &amp; \downarrow{\scriptstyle f_{\#}} &amp;  &amp; \downarrow{\scriptstyle f_{\#}} &amp;  &amp; \downarrow{\scriptstyle f_{\#}}\\
\dots &amp; \rightarrow &amp; C_{n+1}\left(Y\right) &amp; \overset{\partial}{\rightarrow} &amp; C_{n}\left(Y\right) &amp; \overset{\partial}{\rightarrow} &amp; C_{n-1}\left(Y\right) &amp; \rightarrow &amp; \dots\end{array}\]
&lt;/math&gt; 
such that in each square &lt;math&gt;f_{\#}\partial = \partial f_{\#}&lt;/math&gt;, so &lt;math&gt;\partial f_{\#}&lt;/math&gt; defines a '''chain map'''.
--&gt;

We have that &lt;math&gt;f_{\#}&lt;/math&gt; takes cycles to cycles, since &lt;math&gt;\partial \alpha = 0&lt;/math&gt; implies &lt;math&gt;\partial f_{\#}\left( \alpha \right) = f_{\#}\left(\partial \alpha \right) = 0&lt;/math&gt;. Also &lt;math&gt;f_{\#}&lt;/math&gt; takes boundaries to boundaries since &lt;math&gt; f_{\#}\left(\partial \beta \right) = \partial f_{\#}\left(\beta \right)&lt;/math&gt;.

Hence &lt;math&gt;f_{\#}&lt;/math&gt; induces a homomorphism between the homology groups &lt;math&gt;f_{*} : H_n\left(X\right) \rightarrow H_n\left(Y\right)&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;n\geq0&lt;/math&gt;.

== Properties and homotopy invariance ==

{{Main|Singular homology#Homotopy invariance}}

Two basic properties of the push-forward are:

# &lt;math&gt;\left( f\circ g\right)_{*} = f_{*}\circ g_{*}&lt;/math&gt; for the composition of maps &lt;math&gt;X\overset{f}{\rightarrow}Y\overset{g}{\rightarrow}Z&lt;/math&gt;.
# &lt;math&gt;\left( \text{id}_X \right)_{*} = \text{id}&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\text{id}_X&lt;/math&gt; : &lt;math&gt;X\rightarrow X&lt;/math&gt; refers to identity function of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; and  &lt;math&gt;\text{id}\colon H_n\left(X\right) \rightarrow H_n\left(X\right)&lt;/math&gt; refers to the identity isomorphism of homology groups.

&lt;br /&gt;
A main result about the push-forward is the '''homotopy invariance''': if two maps &lt;math&gt;f,g\colon X\rightarrow Y&lt;/math&gt; are homotopic, then they induce the same homomorphism &lt;math&gt;f_{*} = g_{*}\colon H_n\left(X\right) \rightarrow H_n\left(Y\right)&lt;/math&gt;.

This immediately implies that the homology groups of homotopy equivalent spaces are isomorphic:

The maps &lt;math&gt;f_{*}\colon H_n\left(X\right) \rightarrow H_n\left(Y\right)&lt;/math&gt; induced by a homotopy equivalence &lt;math&gt;f\colon X\rightarrow Y&lt;/math&gt; are isomorphisms for all &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;.

{{Regression bar}}
'''Regularized least squares''' ('''RLS''') is a family of methods for solving the [[least squares|least-squares]] problem while using [[regularization (mathematics)|regularization]] to further constrain the resulting solution.

RLS is used for two main reasons. The first comes up when the number of variables in the linear system exceeds the number of observations. In such settings, the [[ordinary least squares|ordinary least-squares]] problem is [[ill-posed problem|ill-posed]] and is therefore impossible to fit because the associated optimization problem has infinitely many solutions. RLS allows the introduction of further constraints that uniquely determine the solution.

The second reason that RLS is used occurs when the number of variables does not exceed the number of observations, but the learned model suffers from poor [[Generalization error|generalization]]. RLS can be used in such cases to improve the generalizability of the model by constraining it at training time. This constraint can either force the solution to be "sparse" in some way or to reflect other prior knowledge about the problem such as information about correlations between features. A [[Bayesian inference|Bayesian]] understanding of this can be reached by showing that RLS methods are often equivalent to [[prior probability|priors]] on the solution to the least-squares problem.

== General formulation ==

Consider a learning setting given by a probabilistic space &lt;math&gt;(X \times Y, \rho(X,Y))&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;Y \in R&lt;/math&gt;. Let &lt;math&gt;S=\{x_{i},y_{i}\}_{i=1}^{n}&lt;/math&gt; denote a training set of &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; pairs i.i.d. with respect to &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt;. Let &lt;math&gt;V:Y \times R \rightarrow [0;\infty)&lt;/math&gt; be a loss function. Define &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; as the space of the functions such that expected risk: 
:&lt;math&gt;
\varepsilon(f) = \int V(y,f(x)) \, d\rho(x,y)
&lt;/math&gt;
is well defined. 
The main goal is to minimize the expected risk:
:&lt;math&gt;
\inf_{f \in F}\varepsilon(f)
&lt;/math&gt;
Since the problem cannot be solved exactly there is a need to specify how to measure the quality of a solution. A good learning algorithm should provide an estimator with a small risk.

As the joint distribution  &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; is typically unknown, the empirical risk is taken. For regularized least squares the square loss function is introduced:
:&lt;math&gt;
\varepsilon(f) = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n V(y_i,f(x_i)) = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n(y_i-f(x_i))^2
&lt;/math&gt;

However, if the functions are from a relatively unconstrained space, such as the set of square-integrable functions on &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;, this approach may overfit the training data, and lead to poor generalization. Thus, it should somehow constrain or penalize the complexity of the function &lt;math&gt;f &lt;/math&gt;. In RLS, this is accomplished by choosing functions from a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) &lt;math&gt;\mathcal {H} &lt;/math&gt;, and adding a regularization term to the objective function, proportional to the norm of the function in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal {H} &lt;/math&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt;
\inf_{f \in F}\varepsilon(f) + \lambda R(f), \lambda &gt; 0
&lt;/math&gt;

== Kernel formulation ==

=== Definition of RKHS ===
A RKHS can be defined by a [[symmetric function|symmetric]] [[positive-definite kernel function]] &lt;math&gt;K(x,z)&lt;/math&gt; with the reproducing property:
:&lt;math&gt;
\langle K_{x},f\rangle_{\mathcal{H}}=f(x),
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;K_x(z)=K(x,z)&lt;/math&gt;. The RKHS for a kernel &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; consists of the [[complete metric space#Completion|completion]] of the space of functions spanned by &lt;math&gt;\left\{ K_x\mid x \in X\right\}&lt;/math&gt;: &lt;math&gt;f(x)=\sum_{i=1}^n \alpha_i K_{x_i}(x),\, f\in\mathcal{H}&lt;/math&gt;, where all &lt;math&gt;\alpha_i&lt;/math&gt; are real numbers. Some commonly used kernels include the linear kernel, inducing the space of linear functions:

: &lt;math&gt;K(x,z)=x^T z,&lt;/math&gt;

the polynomial kernel, inducing the space of polynomial functions of order &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt;:

: &lt;math&gt;K(x,z)=(x^T z+1)^d,&lt;/math&gt;

and the Gaussian kernel:

: &lt;math&gt;K(x,z)=e^{-\frac{\|x-z\|^2}{\sigma^2}}.&lt;/math&gt;

Note that for an arbitrary loss function &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt;, this approach defines a general class of algorithms named Tikhonov regularization. For instance, using the [[hinge loss]] leads to the [[support vector machine]] algorithm, and using the [[epsilon-insensitive loss]] leads to [[support vector regression]].

=== Arbitrary kernel===
The [[representer theorem]] guarantees that the solution can be written as:

:&lt;math&gt;
f(x) = \sum_{i=1}^n c_i K(x_i,x)
&lt;/math&gt; for some &lt;math&gt;c \in \mathbb R^n&lt;/math&gt;.

The minimization problem can be expressed as:

:&lt;math&gt;
\min_{c \in R^n}\frac{1}{n}\|Y-Kc\|^2_{R^n} + \lambda\|f\|^2_H 
&lt;/math&gt;,

where, with some abuse of notation, the &lt;math&gt;i,j&lt;/math&gt; entry of kernel matrix &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; (as opposed to kernel function &lt;math&gt;K(\cdot, \cdot)&lt;/math&gt;) is &lt;math&gt;K(x_i, x_j)&lt;/math&gt;.

For such a function,
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
&amp; \|f\|^2_H = \langle f,f \rangle_{H} =\left\langle \sum_{i=1}^n c_i K(x_i,\cdot), \sum_{j=1}^n c_j K(x_{j},\cdot) \right\rangle_H \\
= {} &amp; \sum_{i=1}^n \sum_{j=1}^n c_i c_j \langle K(x_i,\cdot), K(x_j,\cdot) \rangle_H = \sum_{i=1}^n \sum_{j=1}^n c_i c_j K(x_i,x_j) = c^T Kc,
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

The following minimization problem can be obtained:
:&lt;math&gt;
\min_{c \in R^{n}}\frac{1}{n}\|Y-Kc\|^{2}_{R^{n}} + \lambda c^{T}Kc  
&lt;/math&gt;.

As the sum of convex functions is convex, the solution is unique and its minimum can be found by setting the gradient w.r.t &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt;
-\frac{1}{n}K(Y-Kc) + \lambda Kc = 0 \Rightarrow K(K+\lambda n I)c = K Y \Rightarrow c  = (K+\lambda n I)^{-1}Y &lt;/math&gt;,
where &lt;math&gt; c \in R^{n}&lt;/math&gt;.

==== Complexity ====
The complexity of training is basically the cost of computing the kernel matrix plus the cost of solving the linear system which is roughly &lt;math&gt;O(n^{3})&lt;/math&gt;. The computation of the kernel matrix for the linear or [[Gaussian kernel]] is &lt;math&gt;O(n^{2}D)&lt;/math&gt;. The complexity of testing is &lt;math&gt;O(n)&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Prediction ===
The prediction at a new test point &lt;math&gt;x_{*}&lt;/math&gt; is:
:&lt;math&gt;
f(x_{*}) = \sum_{i=1}^n c_i K(x_i,x_{*}) = K(X,X_{*})^T c
&lt;/math&gt;

=== Linear kernel ===
For convenience a vector notation is introduced. Let &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; be an &lt;math&gt;n\times d&lt;/math&gt; matrix, where the rows are input vectors, and &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; a &lt;math&gt;n\times 1&lt;/math&gt; vector where the entries are corresponding outputs. In terms of vectors, the kernel matrix can be written as &lt;math&gt;\operatorname K=\operatorname X\operatorname X^{T}&lt;/math&gt;. The learning function can be written as:

:&lt;math&gt;
f(x_{*})  = \operatorname K_{x_{*}}c
  =  x_{*}^T \operatorname X^T c
  =  x_{*}^T w
&lt;/math&gt;

Here we define &lt;math&gt;w = X^T c, w \in R^d&lt;/math&gt;. The objective function can be rewritten as:
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
&amp; \frac{1}{n}\|Y-\operatorname Kc\|^2_{R^n}+\lambda c^{T}\operatorname Kc \\[4pt]
= {} &amp; \frac{1}{n}\|y-\operatorname X\operatorname X^T c\|^2_{R^n}+\lambda c^T \operatorname X\operatorname X^{T} c = \frac{1}{n}\|y-\operatorname Xw\|^2_{R^n}+\lambda \|w\|^2_{R^d}
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

The first term is the objective function from [[ordinary least squares]] (OLS) regression, corresponding to the [[residual sum of squares]]. The second term is a regularization term, not present in OLS, which penalizes large &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt; values.
As a smooth finite dimensional problem is considered and it is possible to apply standard calculus tools. In order to minimize the objective function,  the gradient is calculated with respect to &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt; and set it to zero:

: &lt;math&gt;\operatorname X^T \operatorname Xw-\operatorname X^T y+\lambda n w=0&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;w=(\operatorname X^T \operatorname X+\lambda n \operatorname I)^{-1}\operatorname X^T y&lt;/math&gt;

This solution closely resembles that of standard linear regression, with an extra term &lt;math&gt;\lambda\operatorname I&lt;/math&gt;. If the assumptions of OLS regression hold, the solution &lt;math&gt;
w=(\operatorname X^{T}\operatorname X)^{-1}\operatorname X^{T}y&lt;/math&gt;, with &lt;math&gt;\lambda=0&lt;/math&gt;, is an unbiased estimator, and is the minimum-variance linear unbiased estimator, according to the [[Gauss–Markov theorem]]. The term &lt;math&gt;\lambda n \operatorname I&lt;/math&gt; therefore leads to a biased solution; however, it also tends to reduce variance. This is easy to see, as the [[covariance]] matrix of the &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt;-values is proportional to &lt;math&gt;(\operatorname X^T \operatorname X+\lambda n \operatorname I)^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;, and therefore large values of &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; will lead to lower variance. Therefore, manipulating &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; corresponds to trading-off bias and variance. For problems with high-variance &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt; estimates, such as cases with relatively small &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; or with correlated regressors, the optimal prediction accuracy may be obtained by using a nonzero &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;, and thus introducing some bias to reduce variance. Furthermore, it is not uncommon in [[machine learning]] to have cases where &lt;math&gt;n&lt;d&lt;/math&gt;, in which case &lt;math&gt;X^T X&lt;/math&gt; is [[rank (linear algebra)|rank]]-deficient, and a nonzero &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; is necessary to compute &lt;math&gt;(\operatorname X^{T}\operatorname X+\lambda n \operatorname I)^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;.

==== Complexity ====
The parameter &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;
controls the invertibility of the matrix &lt;math&gt;X^{T}X + \lambda n I &lt;/math&gt;.
Several methods can be used to solve the above linear system,
[[Cholesky decomposition]] being probably the method of choice, since the matrix &lt;math&gt;X^{T}X + \lambda n I &lt;/math&gt; is [[symmetric]] and [[positive definite]]. The complexity of this method is &lt;math&gt;O(nD^{2})&lt;/math&gt; for training and
&lt;math&gt;O(D)&lt;/math&gt; for testing. The cost &lt;math&gt;O(nD^{2})&lt;/math&gt; is essentially that of computing &lt;math&gt;X^{T}X&lt;/math&gt;, whereas the inverse computation (or rather the solution of the linear system) is roughly &lt;math&gt;O(D^{3})&lt;/math&gt;.

== Feature maps and Mercer's theorem==
In this section it will be shown how to extend RLS to any kind of reproducing kernel K. Instead of linear kernel a feature map is considered
&lt;math&gt;\Phi: X \rightarrow F&lt;/math&gt; for some Hilbert space &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;, called the feature space.   In this case the kernel is defined as: The matrix &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is now replaced by the new data matrix  &lt;math&gt;\Phi&lt;/math&gt;, where  &lt;math&gt;\Phi_{ij} = \phi_{j}(x_{i})&lt;/math&gt;, or the  &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt;-th component of the  &lt;math&gt; \phi(x_{i})&lt;/math&gt;.

:&lt;math&gt;
K(x,x') = \langle \Phi(x), \Phi(x') \rangle_F. &lt;/math&gt;
It means that for a given training set &lt;math&gt;K = \Phi \Phi^T&lt;/math&gt;. Thus, the objective function can be written as:
:&lt;math&gt;
\min_{c \in \mathbb R^n}\|Y - \Phi \Phi^{T}\|^2_{R^n} + \lambda c^{T}\Phi \Phi^{T} c
&lt;/math&gt;

This approach is known as the [[kernel trick]]. This technique can significantly simplify the computational operations. If &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; is high dimensional, computing  &lt;math&gt;\phi(x_{i})&lt;/math&gt; may be rather intensive.  If the explicit form of the kernel function is known, we just need to compute and store the &lt;math&gt;n\times n&lt;/math&gt; kernel matrix &lt;math&gt;\operatorname K&lt;/math&gt;.

In fact, the [[Hilbert space]] &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; need not be isomorphic to &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^{m}&lt;/math&gt;, and can be infinite dimensional. This  follows from [[Mercer's theorem]], which states that a continuous, symmetric, positive definite kernel function can be expressed as:

&lt;math&gt;K(x,z)=\sum_{i=1}^\infty \sigma_i e_i(x) e_i(z)&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;e_i(x)&lt;/math&gt; form an [[orthonormal basis]] for &lt;math&gt;\ell^2(X)&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\sigma_i \in\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;. If feature maps  is defined &lt;math&gt;\phi(x)&lt;/math&gt; with components &lt;math&gt;\phi_{i}(x)=\sqrt{\sigma_{i}}e_{i}(x)&lt;/math&gt;, it follows that &lt;math&gt;K(x,z)=\langle\phi(x),\phi(z)\rangle&lt;/math&gt;. This demonstrates that any kernel can be associated with a feature map, and that RLS generally consists of linear RLS performed in some possibly higher-dimensional feature space. While Mercer's theorem shows how one feature map that can be associated with a kernel, in fact multiple feature maps can be associated with a given reproducing kernel. For instance, the map &lt;math&gt;\phi(x)=K_{x}&lt;/math&gt; satisfies the property &lt;math&gt;K(x,z)=\langle\phi(x),\phi(z)\rangle&lt;/math&gt; for an arbitrary reproducing kernel.

==Bayesian interpretation==
{{further|Bayesian linear regression|Bayesian interpretation of kernel regularization}}

Least squares can be viewed as a likelihood maximization under an assumption of normally distributed residuals. This is because the exponent of the [[Gaussian distribution]] is quadratic in the data, and so is the least-squares objective function. In this framework, the regularization terms of RLS can be understood to be encoding [[prior distribution|priors]] on &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt;. For instance, Tikhonov regularization corresponds to a normally distributed prior on &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt; that is centered at 0. To see this, first note that the OLS objective is proportional to the [[log-likelihood]] function when each sampled &lt;math&gt;y^i&lt;/math&gt; is normally distributed around &lt;math&gt;w^T \cdot x^i&lt;/math&gt;. Then observe that a normal prior on &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt; centered at 0 has a log-probability of the form
: &lt;math&gt;\log P(w) = q - \alpha \sum_{j=1}^d w_j^2&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; are constants that depend on the variance of the prior and are independent of &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt;. Thus, minimizing the logarithm of the likelihood times the prior is equivalent to minimizing the sum of the OLS loss function and the ridge regression regularization term.

This gives a more intuitive interpretation for why [[Tikhonov regularization]] leads to a unique solution to the least-squares problem: there are infinitely many vectors &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt; satisfying the constraints obtained from the data, but since we come to the problem with a prior belief that &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt; is normally distributed around the origin, we will end up choosing a solution with this constraint in mind.

Other regularization methods correspond to different priors. See the [[Regularized least squares#List of RLS methods|list]] below for more details.

==Specific examples==

===Ridge regression (or Tikhonov regularization){{anchor|Ridge regression|Tikhonov regularization}}===
{{main|Ridge regression{{!}}Ridge regression (or Tikhonov regularization)}}
One particularly common choice for the penalty function  &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is the squared [[l2 norm|&lt;math&gt;\ell_2&lt;/math&gt; norm]], i.e.,
: &lt;math&gt;R(w) = \sum_{j=1}^d w_j^2&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \frac{1}{n}\|Y-\operatorname Xw\|^{2}_{2}+\lambda  \sum_{j=1}^d |w_j|^2 \rightarrow  \min_{w \in \mathbf{R^{d}}}&lt;/math&gt;
The most common names for this are called [[Tikhonov regularization]] and [[ridge regression]]. 
It admits a closed-form solution for &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt;:
: &lt;math&gt;w = (X^T X + \alpha I)^{-1} X^T Y &lt;/math&gt;
The name ridge regression alludes to the fact that the &lt;math&gt;\alpha I&lt;/math&gt; term adds positive entries along the diagonal "ridge" of the sample [[covariance matrix]] &lt;math&gt;X^T X&lt;/math&gt;.

When &lt;math&gt;\alpha=0&lt;/math&gt;, i.e., in the case of [[ordinary least squares]], the condition that &lt;math&gt;d &gt; n&lt;/math&gt; causes the sample [[covariance matrix]] &lt;math&gt;X^T X&lt;/math&gt; to not have full rank and so it cannot be inverted to yield a unique solution. This is why there can be an infinitude of solutions to the [[ordinary least squares]] problem when &lt;math&gt;d &gt; n&lt;/math&gt;. However, when &lt;math&gt;\alpha &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;, i.e., when ridge regression is used, the addition of &lt;math&gt;\alpha I&lt;/math&gt; to the sample covariance matrix ensures that all of its eigenvalues will be strictly greater than 0. In other words, it becomes invertible, and the solution becomes unique.

Compared to ordinary least squares, ridge regression is not unbiased. It accepts little bias to reduce variance and the [[mean square error]], and helps to improve the prediction accuracy. Thus, ridge estimator yields more stable solutions by shrinking coefficients but suffers from the lack of sensitivity to the data.

===Lasso regression===
{{main|Lasso (statistics)}}
The least absolute selection and shrinkage (LASSO) method is another popular choice. In [[lasso regression]], the lasso penalty function &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is the [[l1 norm|&lt;math&gt;\ell_1&lt;/math&gt; norm]], i.e.
: &lt;math&gt;R(w) = \sum_{j=1}^d \left| w_j \right|&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \frac{1}{n}\|Y-\operatorname Xw\|^{2}_{2}+\lambda  \sum_{j=1}^d |w_j| \rightarrow  \min_{w \in \mathbf{R^{d}}}&lt;/math&gt;

Note that the lasso penalty function is convex but not strictly convex. 
Unlike [[Tikhonov regularization]], this scheme does not have a convenient closed-form solution: instead, the solution is typically found using [[quadratic programming]] or more general [[convex optimization]] methods, as well as by specific algorithms such as the [[least-angle regression]] algorithm.

An important difference between lasso regression and Tikhonov regularization is that lasso regression forces more entries of &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt; to actually equal 0 than would otherwise. In contrast, while Tikhonov regularization forces entries of &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt; to be small, it does not force more of them to be 0 than would be otherwise. Thus, LASSO regularization is more appropriate than Tikhonov regularization in cases in which we expect the number of non-zero entries of &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt; to be small, and Tikhonov regularization is more appropriate when we expect that entries of &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt; will generally be small but not necessarily zero. Which of these regimes is more relevant depends on the specific data set at hand.

Besides feature selection described above, LASSO has some limitations. Ridge regression provides better accuracy in the case &lt;math&gt; n &gt; d &lt;/math&gt; for highly correlated variables.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In another case, &lt;math&gt; n &lt; d &lt;/math&gt;, LASSO selects at most &lt;math&gt;
n&lt;/math&gt; variables. Moreover, LASSO tends to select some arbitrary variables from group of highly correlated samples, so there is no grouping effect.

===''ℓ''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; Penalization===
:&lt;math&gt; \frac{1}{n}\|Y-\operatorname Xw\|^2_2+\lambda \|w_j\|_0 \rightarrow  \min_{w \in \mathbf{R^d}}&lt;/math&gt;
The most extreme way to enforce sparsity is to say that the actual magnitude of the coefficients of &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt; does not matter; rather, the only thing that determines the complexity of &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt; is the number of non-zero entries. This corresponds to setting &lt;math&gt;R(w)&lt;/math&gt; to be the [[l0 norm|&lt;math&gt;\ell_0&lt;/math&gt; norm]] of &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt;. This regularization function, while attractive for the sparsity that it guarantees, is very difficult to solve because doing so requires optimization of a function that is not even weakly [[convex optimization|convex]]. Lasso regression is the minimal possible relaxation of &lt;math&gt;\ell_0&lt;/math&gt; penalization that yields a weakly convex optimization problem.

=== Elastic net===
{{main|Elastic net regularization}}

For any non-negative &lt;math&gt;\lambda_{1}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\lambda_{2}&lt;/math&gt; the objective has the following form:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{n}\|Y-\operatorname Xw\|^2_2+\lambda_{1}\sum_{j=1}^d |w_j| + \lambda_2 \sum_{j=1}^d |w_j|^2 \rightarrow  \min_{w \in \mathbf{R^d}}&lt;/math&gt;

Let &lt;math&gt;\alpha = \frac{\lambda_1}{\lambda_1 + \lambda_2}&lt;/math&gt;, then the solution of the minimization problem is described as:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{n}\|Y-\operatorname Xw\|^2_2 \rightarrow  \min_{w \in \mathbf{R^d}} \text{s.t.} (1-\alpha)\|w\|_1 + \alpha \|w\|_2 \leq t&lt;/math&gt; for some &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;.

Consider   &lt;math&gt;(1-\alpha)\|w\|_{1} + \alpha \|w\|_{2} \leq t&lt;/math&gt; as an Elastic Net penalty function.

When &lt;math&gt;\alpha = 1 &lt;/math&gt;, elastic net becomes ridge regression, whereas &lt;math&gt;\alpha = 0 &lt;/math&gt; it becomes Lasso. &lt;math&gt;\forall \alpha \in (0,1]&lt;/math&gt; Elastic Net penalty function doesn't have the first derivative at 0 and it is strictly convex 
&lt;math&gt;\forall \alpha &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt; taking the properties both [[lasso regression]] and [[ridge regression]].

One of the main properties of the Elastic Net is that it can select groups of correlated variables. The difference between weight vectors of samples &lt;math&gt;x_{i}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x_{j}&lt;/math&gt; is given by:
:&lt;math&gt;
|w^{*}_i(\lambda_{1}, \lambda_{2}) -  w^{*}_{j}(\lambda_1, \lambda_2)| \leq \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n|y_i|}{\lambda_2}\sqrt{2(1-\rho_{ij})}
&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\rho_{ij} = x_{i}^{T}x_{j}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal
 | author = [[Zou Hui|Hui, Zou]] |author2=Hastie, Trevor

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If &lt;math&gt;x_{i}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x_{j}&lt;/math&gt; are highly correlated ( &lt;math&gt;\rho_{ij} \rightarrow 1&lt;/math&gt;), the weight vectors are very close. In the case of negatively correlated samples  ( &lt;math&gt;\rho_{ij} \rightarrow -1&lt;/math&gt;) the samples &lt;math&gt;-x_{j}&lt;/math&gt; can be taken. To summarize, for highly correlated variables the weight vectors tend to be equal up to a sign in the case of negative correlated variables.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2513">'''Research Computing Services''' (separated in August 2007 from the former Manchester Computing at the [[University of Manchester]]), provides the focus for the [[University of Manchester]]'s activities in [[supercomputing]] or [[high-performance computing]], [[grid computing]] or [[e-science]] and [[computational science]]. Research Computing Services activities include services, training and research &amp; development.

== Supercomputers ==

The University of Manchester has been home to many [[supercomputers]], starting from the 1948 [[Manchester Baby]] - the world's first stored program computer. Others have included CDC7600 (1972, and a second in 1977), a CDC Cyber 205, VP1200, VPX and 240/10. The CSAR service (see below) [[supercomputers]] included a [[Cray T3E|576 PE Cray T3E-1200E]] (1998, upgraded to 816PE in 2000), and [[Silicon Graphics|SGI]] [[SGI Origin 3000 and Onyx 3000|Origin 3000]] (2001) and [[Altix]] (2003) systems. More recently some large clusters (e.g., the 200 processor Dell EM64T cluster) have been installed.

== National Computing Services ==

Research Computing Services and its predecessors (Manchester Computing etc.) have been providing (high performance) computing services nationally in the UK since the 1970s. Manchester Computing operated the UK's 1998-2006 national supercomputer service [http://www.csar.cfs.ac.uk CSAR] with [[Silicon Graphics|SGI]] and CSC Ltd. It currently operates other national computer services in the UK, including the Access Grid Support Centre (AGSC) and, as part of consortia, the [http://www.ngs.ac.uk UK National Grid Service (NGS)] and [http://www.nw-grid.ac.uk North West Grid].

== Research Centres ==

Research Computing Services is a part of several research centres including [http://www.esnw.ac.uk E-Science North West (ESNW)], and the UK's [http://www.ncess.ac.uk National Centre for e-Social Science (NCeSS)].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9823">In mathematics, '''Schubert polynomials''' are  generalizations of [[Schur polynomials]] that  represent cohomology classes of [[Schubert cycle]]s in [[Generalized flag variety|flag varieties]]. 
They were introduced by {{harvtxt|Lascoux|Schützenberger|1982}} and are named after [[Hermann Schubert]].

==Background==

{{harvtxt|Lascoux|1995}} described the history of Schubert polynomials.

The Schubert polynomials &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{S}_w&lt;/math&gt; are polynomials in the variables   &lt;math&gt;\  x_1,x_2,\ldots&lt;/math&gt;  depending on an element &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt; of the infinite symmetric group  &lt;math&gt;S_\infty&lt;/math&gt; of all permutations of  &lt;math&gt;1, 2, 3,\ldots &lt;/math&gt; fixing all but a finite number of elements. They form a basis for the polynomial ring &lt;math&gt; \mathbb{Z}[x_1,x_2,\ldots]&lt;/math&gt; in infinitely many variables.

The cohomology of the flag manifold &lt;math&gt; \text{Fl}(m)&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}[x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_m]/I&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; is the ideal generated by homogeneous symmetric functions of positive degree. 
The Schubert polynomial &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{S}_w&lt;/math&gt; is the unique homogeneous polynomial of degree  &lt;math&gt; \ell(w)&lt;/math&gt; representing the Schubert cycle of  &lt;math&gt; w&lt;/math&gt; in the cohomology of the [[Generalized flag variety|flag manifold]] &lt;math&gt; \text{Fl}(m)&lt;/math&gt; for all sufficiently large &lt;math&gt; m&lt;/math&gt;.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}

==Properties==

*If  &lt;math&gt; w_0&lt;/math&gt; is the permutation of longest length in &lt;math&gt; S_n&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt; \mathfrak{S}_{w_0} = x_1^{n-1}x_2^{n-2} \cdots x_{n-1}^1&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt; \partial_i \mathfrak{S}_w = \mathfrak{S}_{ws_i}&lt;/math&gt;  if &lt;math&gt;  w(i) &gt; w(i+1)&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt; s_i&lt;/math&gt; is the transposition &lt;math&gt;(i, i+1)&lt;/math&gt; and where &lt;math&gt; \partial_i&lt;/math&gt; is the divided difference operator taking &lt;math&gt; P&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt; (P - s_iP)/(x_i - x_{i+1})&lt;/math&gt;.
Schubert polynomials can be calculated recursively from these two properties. In particular, this implies that &lt;math&gt; \mathfrak{S}_w = \partial_{w^{-1}w_0} x_1^{n-1}x_2^{n-2} \cdots x_{n-1}^1&lt;/math&gt;.

Other properties are
*&lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{S}_{id} = 1&lt;/math&gt;
*If &lt;math&gt;s_i&lt;/math&gt; is the transposition &lt;math&gt;(i,i+1)&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{S}_{s_i} = x_1 + \ldots + x_i &lt;/math&gt;.
*If &lt;math&gt;w(i) &lt; w(i + 1) &lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;i \neq r&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{S}_w&lt;/math&gt; is the Schur polynomial &lt;math&gt;s_\lambda(x_1,\ldots,x_r)&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; is the partition &lt;math&gt;(w(r) - r, \cdots, w(2) - 2, w(1) - 1)&lt;/math&gt;. In particular all Schur polynomials (of a finite number of variables) are Schubert polynomials.
*Schubert polynomials have positive coefficients. A conjectural rule for their coefficients was put forth by [[Richard P. Stanley]], and proven in two papers, one by [[Sergey Fomin]] and Stanley and one by [[Sara Billey]], William Jockusch, and Stanley.
* The Schubert polynomials can be seen as a generating function over certain combinatorial objects called ''pipe dreams'' or ''rc-graphs''. These are in bijection with ''reduced Kogan faces'', (introduced in the PhD thesis of Mikhail Kogan) which are special faces of the Gelfand-Tsetlin polytope.

As an example &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{S}_{24531}(x) = x_1 x_3^2 x_4 x_2^2+x_1^2 x_3 x_4 x_2^2+x_1^2 x_3^2 x_4 x_2&lt;/math&gt;.

==Multiplicative structure constants==

Since the Schubert polynomials form a basis, there are unique coefficients &lt;math&gt;c^{\alpha}_{\beta\gamma}&lt;/math&gt; 
such that &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{S}_\beta \mathfrak{S}_\gamma = \sum_\alpha c^{\alpha}_{\beta\gamma} \mathfrak{S}_\alpha&lt;/math&gt;.
These can be seen as a generalization of the Littlewood−Richardson coefficients described by the [[Littlewood–Richardson rule]].
For representation-theoretical reasons{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}, these coefficients are non-negative integers and it is an 
outstanding problem in [[representation theory]] and [[combinatorics]] to give a combinatorial rule for these numbers.

==Double Schubert polynomials==

Double Schubert polynomials &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{S}_w(x_1,x_2,\ldots, y_1,y_2,\ldots)&lt;/math&gt; are polynomials in two infinite sets of variables, parameterized by an element ''w'' of the infinite symmetric group, that becomes the usual Schubert polynomials when all the variables &lt;math&gt;y_i&lt;/math&gt; are &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;.

The double Schubert polynomial &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{S}_w(x_1,x_2,\ldots, y_1,y_2,\ldots)&lt;/math&gt; are characterized by  the properties
*&lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{S}_w(x_1,x_2,\ldots, y_1,y_2,\ldots) = \prod\limits_{i + j \leq n} (x_i - y_j)&lt;/math&gt; when &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt; is the permutation on &lt;math&gt;1,\ldots,n&lt;/math&gt; of longest length.
*&lt;math&gt; \partial_i \mathfrak{S}_w = \mathfrak{S}_{ws_i}&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;  w(i) &gt; w(i+1)&lt;/math&gt;.

The double Schubert polynomials can also be defined as 
&lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{S}_w(x,y) =\sum_{   w=v^{-1}u \text{ and } \ell(w)=\ell(u)+\ell(v) } \mathfrak{S}_u(x)  \mathfrak{S}_v(-y)&lt;/math&gt;.

==Quantum Schubert polynomials==

{{harvtxt|Fomin|Gelfand|Postnikov|1997}} introduced quantum Schubert polynomials, that have the same relation to the [[Quantum cohomology#Small quantum cohomology|(small) quantum cohomology]] of flag manifolds that ordinary Schubert polynomials have to the ordinary cohomology.

==Universal Schubert polynomials==

{{harvtxt|Fulton|1999}} introduced universal Schubert polynomials, that generalize classical and quantum Schubert polynomials. He also described universal double Schubert polynomials generalizing double Schubert polynomials.

In the [[mathematics|mathematical]] fields of [[order theory|order]] and [[domain theory]], a '''Scott domain''' is an [[algebraic poset|algebraic]], [[bounded complete|bounded-complete]] [[complete partial order|cpo]]. It has been named in honour of [[Dana S. Scott]], who was the first to study these structures at the advent of domain theory. Scott domains are very closely related to [[algebraic lattice]]s, being different only in possibly lacking a [[greatest element]]. They are also closely related to [[Scott information system]]s, which constitute a "syntactic" representation of Scott domains.

While the term "Scott domain" is widely used with the above definition, the term "domain" does not have such a generally accepted meaning and different authors will use different definitions; Scott himself used "domain" for the structures now called "Scott domains". Additionally, Scott domains appear with other names like "algebraic semilattice" in some publications.

Originally, [[Dana Scott]] demanded a [[complete lattice]], and the Russian mathematician [[Yury Yershov]] constructed the isomorphic structure of [[complete partial order|cpo]].  But this was not recognized until after scientific communications improved after the fall of the [[Iron Curtain]].  In honour of their work, a number of mathematical papers now dub this fundamental construction a "Scott–Ershov" domain.  

==Definition==
Formally, a non-empty [[partially ordered set]] (''D'', ≤) is called a ''Scott domain'' if the following hold:

* ''D'' is [[complete partial order|directed complete]], i.e. all [[directed set|directed subsets]] of ''D'' have a [[supremum]].
* ''D'' is [[bounded complete]], i.e. all subsets of ''D'' that have some [[upper bound]] have a supremum.
* ''D'' is [[algebraic poset|algebraic]], i.e. every element of ''D'' can be obtained as the supremum of a directed set of [[compact element]]s of ''D''.

==Properties==
Since the empty set certainly has some upper bound, we can conclude the existence of a [[least element]] &lt;math&gt;\bot&lt;/math&gt; (the supremum of the empty set) from bounded completeness.

The property of being bounded complete is equivalent to the existence of [[infimum|infima]] of all non-empty subsets of ''D''. It is well known that the existence of all infima implies the existence of all suprema and thus makes a partially ordered set into a [[complete lattice]]. Thus, when a top element (the infimum of the empty set) is adjoined to a Scott domain, one can conclude that:
# the new top element is compact (since the order was directed complete before) and
# the resulting poset will be an [[algebraic lattice]] (i.e. a complete lattice that is algebraic). 
Consequently, Scott domains are in a sense "almost" algebraic lattices.

Scott domains become [[topological space]]s by introducing the [[Scott continuity|Scott topology]].

==Explanation==
Scott domains are intended to represent ''partial algebraic data'', ordered by information content. An element &lt;math&gt;x \in D&lt;/math&gt; is a piece of data that might not be fully defined. The statement &lt;math&gt;x \sqsubseteq y&lt;/math&gt; means "&lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; contains all the information that &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; does".

With this interpretation we can see that the [[supremum]] &lt;math&gt;\sqcup X&lt;/math&gt; of a subset &lt;math&gt;X \subseteq D&lt;/math&gt; is the element that contains all the information that ''any'' element of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; contains, but ''no more''. Obviously such a supremum only exists (i.e., makes sense) provided &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; does not contain inconsistent information; hence the domain is directed and bounded complete, but not ''all'' suprema necessarily exist. The algebraicity axiom essentially ensures that all elements get all their information from (non-strictly) lower down in the ordering; in particular, the jump from compact or "finite" to non-compact or "infinite" elements does not covertly introduce any extra information that cannot be reached at some finite stage. The bottom element is the supremum of the empty set, i.e. the element containing no information at all; its existence is implied by bounded completeness, since, vacuously, the empty set has an upper bound in any non-empty poset.

On the other hand, the infimum &lt;math&gt;\sqcap X&lt;/math&gt; is the element that contains all the information that is shared by ''all'' elements of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;, and ''no less''. If &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; contains no consistent information, then its elements have no information in common and so its infimum is &lt;math&gt;\bot&lt;/math&gt;. In this way all infima exist, but not all infima are necessarily interesting.

This definition in terms of partial data allows an algebra to be defined as the limit of a sequence of increasingly more defined partial algebras—in other words a fixed point of an operator that adds progressively more information to the algebra. For more information, see [[Domain theory]].

==Examples==
* Every finite poset is directed complete and algebraic. Thus any bounded-complete finite poset trivially is a Scott domain.
* The [[natural numbers]] with an additional top element ω constitute an algebraic lattice, hence a Scott domain. For more examples in this direction, see the article on [[algebraic lattice]]s.
* Consider the set of all finite and infinite words over the alphabet {0,1}, ordered by the [[prefix order]] on words. Thus, a word ''w'' is smaller than some word ''v'' if ''w'' is a prefix of ''v'', i.e. if there is some (finite or infinite) word ''v' '' such that ''w'' ''v' '' = ''v''. For example, 101 ≤ 10110. The empty word is the bottom element of this ordering, and every directed set (which is always a [[total order|chain]]) is easily seen to have a supremum. Likewise, one immediately verifies bounded completeness. However, the resulting poset is certainly missing a top having many maximal elements instead (like 111... or 000...). It is also algebraic, since every finite word happens to be compact and we certainly can approximate infinite words by chains of finite ones. Thus this is a Scott domain which is not an algebraic lattice.
* For a negative example, consider the [[real number]]s in the unit interval [0,1], ordered by their natural order. This bounded-complete cpo is not algebraic. In fact its only compact element is 0.

For simplicity, the following assumes all relevant state spaces are finite-dimensional. First, consider separability for [[pure state]]s. 

Let &lt;math&gt;H_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;H_2&lt;/math&gt; be quantum mechanical state spaces,  that is, finite-dimensional [[Hilbert space]]s with basis states &lt;math&gt;\{|{a_i}\rangle\}_{i=1}^n&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\{|{b_j}\rangle\}_{j=1}^m&lt;/math&gt;, respectively. By a [[mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics#Mathematical structure of quantum mechanics|postulate of quantum mechanics]], the state space of the composite system is given by the [[tensor product]]

:&lt;math&gt;H_1 \otimes H_2&lt;/math&gt;

with base states &lt;math&gt;\{|{a_i}\rangle\otimes |{b_j}\rangle\}&lt;/math&gt;, or in more compact notation &lt;math&gt;\{|a_i b_j \rangle\}&lt;/math&gt;. From the very definition of the tensor product, any vector of norm 1, i.e. a pure state of the composite system, can be written as
 
: &lt;math&gt;
|\psi\rangle = \sum_{i,j} c_{i,j} (| a_i \rangle \otimes | b_j \rangle) =\sum_{i,j} c_{i,j} | a_i b_j \rangle, 
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;c_{i,j}&lt;/math&gt; is a constant. 
If a pure state &lt;math&gt; |\psi\rangle \in H_1 \otimes H_2&lt;/math&gt; can be written in the form &lt;math&gt;|\psi\rangle = |\psi_1\rangle \otimes |\psi_2\rangle &lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;|\psi _i \rangle &lt;/math&gt; is a pure state of the i-th subsystem, it is said to be ''separable''. Otherwise it is called ''entangled''.  When a system is in an entangled pure state, it is not possible to assign states to its subsystems. This will be true, in the appropriate sense, for the mixed state case as well.

Formally, the embedding of a product of states into the product space is given by the [[Segre embedding]]. That is, a quantum-mechanical pure state is separable if and only if it is in the image of the Segre embedding.

The above discussion can be extended to the case of when the state space is infinite-dimensional with virtually nothing changed.

==Separability for mixed states==

Consider the mixed state case. A mixed state of the composite system is described by a [[density matrix]] &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; acting on &lt;math&gt;H_1 \otimes H_2&lt;/math&gt;. ρ is separable if there exist &lt;math&gt;p_k\geq 0&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\{ \rho_1^k \}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\{ \rho_2^k \}&lt;/math&gt; which are mixed states of the respective subsystems such that

:&lt;math&gt;
\rho=\sum_k p_k \rho_1^k \otimes \rho_2^k
&lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt;\;
\sum_k p_k = 1.
&lt;/math&gt;

Otherwise &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; is called an entangled state. We can assume without loss of generality in the above expression that &lt;math&gt;\{ \rho_1^k \}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\{ \rho_2^k \}&lt;/math&gt; are all rank-1 projections, that is, they represent ''pure ensembles'' of the appropriate subsystems. It is clear from the definition that the family of separable states is a [[convex set]].

Notice that, again from the definition of the tensor product, any density matrix, indeed any matrix acting on the composite state space, can be trivially written in the desired form, if we drop the requirement that &lt;math&gt;\{ \rho_1^k \}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\{ \rho_2^k \}&lt;/math&gt; are themselves states and &lt;math&gt;\; \sum_k p_k = 1.&lt;/math&gt;  If these requirements are satisfied, then we can interpret the total state as a probability distribution over uncorrelated [[product state]]s.

In terms of [[quantum channel]]s, a separable state can be created from any other state using [[LOCC|local actions and classical communication]] while an entangled state cannot.

When the state spaces are infinite-dimensional, density matrices are replaced by positive [[trace class]] operators with trace 1, and a state is separable if it can be approximated, in trace norm, by states of the above form.

If there is only a single non-zero &lt;math&gt;p_k&lt;/math&gt;, then the state is called [[simply separable state|simply separable]] (or it is called a "product state").

== Extending to the multipartite case ==

The above discussion generalizes easily to the case of a quantum system consisting of more than two subsystems. Let a system have ''n'' subsystems and have state space &lt;math&gt;H = H_1 \otimes \cdots \otimes H_n&lt;/math&gt;. A pure state &lt;math&gt;| \psi \rangle \in H&lt;/math&gt; is separable if it takes the form

:&lt;math&gt;| \psi \rangle = | \psi_1 \rangle \otimes \cdots \otimes | \psi_n \rangle .&lt;/math&gt;

Similarly, a mixed state ρ acting on ''H'' is separable if it is a convex sum

:&lt;math&gt;\rho = \sum_k p_k \rho_1 ^k \otimes \cdots \otimes \rho_n ^k.&lt;/math&gt;

Or, in the infinite-dimensional case, ρ is separable if it can be approximated in the trace norm by states of the above form.

== Separability criterion ==

The problem of deciding whether a state is separable in general is sometimes called '''the separability problem'''{{anchor|quantum separability problem}} in [[quantum information theory]]. It is considered to be a difficult problem. It has been shown to be [[NP-hard]].&lt;ref name="NP-hard1"&gt;Gurvits, L., Classical deterministic complexity of Edmonds’ problem and quantum entanglement, in Proceedings of the 35th ACM Symposium on Theory of Computing, ACM Press, New York, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NP-hard2"&gt;Sevag Gharibian,  Strong NP-Hardness of the Quantum Separability Problem, Quantum Information and Computation, Vol. 10, No. 3&amp;4, pp. 343-360, 2010. arXiv:0810.4507.&lt;/ref&gt; Some appreciation for this difficulty can be obtained if one attempts to solve the problem by employing the direct brute force approach, for a fixed dimension. We see that the problem quickly becomes intractable, even for low dimensions. Thus more sophisticated formulations are required. The separability problem is a subject of current research.

A ''separability criterion'' is a necessary condition a state must satisfy to be separable. In the low-dimensional (''2 X 2'' and ''2 X 3'') cases, the [[Peres-Horodecki criterion]] is actually a necessary and sufficient condition for separability. Other separability criteria include the [[range criterion]] and [[reduction criterion]]. See Ref.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gühne|first1=Otfried|last2=Tóth|first2=Géza|title=Entanglement detection|journal=Physics Reports|volume=474|issue=1–6|pages=1–75|doi=10.1016/j.physrep.2009.02.004|arxiv = 0811.2803 |bibcode = 2009PhR...474....1G }}&lt;/ref&gt; for a review of separability criteria in discrete variable systems.

In continuous variable systems, the [[Peres-Horodecki criterion]] also applies. Specifically, Simon &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Simon|first1=R.|title=Peres-Horodecki Separability Criterion for Continuous Variable Systems|journal=Physical Review Letters|volume=84|issue=12|pages=2726–2729|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.84.2726|arxiv = quant-ph/9909044 |bibcode = 2000PhRvL..84.2726S|pmid=11017310}}&lt;/ref&gt; formulated a particular version of the Peres-Horodecki criterion in terms of the second-order moments of canonical operators and showed that it is necessary and sufficient for &lt;math&gt; 1\oplus1 &lt;/math&gt;-mode Gaussian states (see Ref.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Duan|first1=Lu-Ming|last2=Giedke|first2=G.|last3=Cirac|first3=J.

It was later found &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Werner|first1=R. F.|last2=Wolf|first2=M.

== Characterization via algebraic geometry ==

Quantum mechanics may be modelled on a [[projective Hilbert space]], and the [[categorical product]] of two such spaces is the [[Segre embedding]]. In the bipartite case, a quantum state is separable if and only if it lies in the [[image (mathematics)|image]] of the Segre embedding.
[[Jon Magne Leinaas]], [[Jan Myrheim]] and [[Eirik Ovrum]] in their paper "Geometrical aspects of entanglement"&lt;ref name="geom approach"&gt;"Geometrical aspects of entanglement", Physical Review A 74, 012313 (2006)&lt;/ref&gt; describe the problem and study the geometry of the separable states as a subset of the general state matrices. This subset have some intersection with the subset of states holding [[Peres-Horodecki criterion]]. In this paper, Leinaas et al. also give a numerical approach to test for separability in the general case.

== Testing for separability ==

Since separability testing in a general case is an [[NP-hard]].&lt;ref name="NP-hard1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NP-hard2" /&gt; problem, in their paper,&lt;ref name="geom approach" /&gt; Leinaas et al. offer a numerical approach, iteratively refining an estimated separable state towards the target state to be tested, checking if the target state can indeed be reached. An implementation of the algorithm (including a built in [[Peres-Horodecki criterion]] testing) is brought in the [http://physics.technion.ac.il/stateseparator/ "StateSeparator" web-app]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7525">In the [[mathematics|mathematical]] fields of [[topology]] and [[K-theory]], the '''Serre–Swan theorem''', also called '''Swan's theorem''', relates the geometric notion of [[vector bundle]]s to the algebraic concept of [[projective module]]s and gives rise to a common intuition throughout [[mathematics]]: "projective modules over [[commutative ring]]s are like vector bundles on compact spaces".

The two precise formulations of the theorems differ somewhat. The original theorem, as stated by [[Jean-Pierre Serre]] in 1955, is more algebraic in nature, and concerns vector bundles on an [[algebraic variety]] over an [[algebraically closed field]] (of any [[characteristic (algebra)|characteristic]]). The complementary variant stated by [[Richard Swan]] in 1962 is more analytic, and concerns (real, complex, or quaternionic) vector bundles on a [[smooth manifold]] or [[Hausdorff space]].

== Differential geometry ==
Suppose ''M'' is a [[smooth manifold]] (not necessarily compact), and a ''E'' is a [[smooth vector bundle]] over ''M''. Then ''Γ(E)'', the space of [[section (fiber bundle)|smooth sections]] of ''E'', is a [[module (mathematics)|module]] over C&lt;sup&gt;∞&lt;/sup&gt;(''M'') (the commutative algebra of smooth real-valued functions on ''M''). Swan's theorem states that this module is [[finitely-generated module|finitely generated]] and [[projective module|projective]] over C&lt;sup&gt;∞&lt;/sup&gt;(''M''). In other words, every vector bundle is a direct summand of some trivial bundle: &lt;math&gt;M \times \R^k&lt;/math&gt; for some ''k''. The theorem can be proved by constructing a bundle epimorphism from a trivial bundle &lt;math&gt;M \times \R^k \to E.&lt;/math&gt; This can be done by, for instance, exhibiting sections ''s''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;...''s''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; with the property that for each point ''p'', {''s''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;(''p'')} span the fiber over ''p''. 

When ''M'' is [[connected space|connected]], the converse is also true: every [[finitely generated projective module]] over C&lt;sup&gt;∞&lt;/sup&gt;(''M'') arises in this way from some smooth vector bundle on ''M''. Such a module can be viewed as a smooth function ''f'' on ''M'' with values in the ''n'' &amp;times; ''n'' idempotent matrices for some ''n''. The fiber of the corresponding vector bundle over ''x'' is then the range of ''f''(''x''). If ''M'' is not connected, the converse does not hold unless one allows for vector bundles of non-constant rank (which means admitting manifolds of non-constant dimension). For example, if ''M'' is a zero-dimensional 2-point manifold, the module &lt;math&gt;\R\oplus 0&lt;/math&gt; is finitely-generated and projective over &lt;math&gt;C^\infty(M)\cong\R\times\R&lt;/math&gt; but is not [[free module|free]], and so cannot correspond to the sections of any (constant-rank) vector bundle over ''M'' (all of which are trivial).

Another way of stating the above is that for any connected smooth manifold ''M'', the section [[functor]] ''Γ'' from the [[category theory|category]] of smooth vector bundles over ''M'' to the category of finitely generated, projective C&lt;sup&gt;∞&lt;/sup&gt;(''M'')-modules is [[full functor|full]], [[faithful functor|faithful]], and [[essentially surjective functor|essentially surjective]]. Therefore the category of smooth vector bundles on ''M'' is [[Equivalence of categories|equivalent]] to the category of finitely generated, projective C&lt;sup&gt;∞&lt;/sup&gt;(''M'')-modules. Details may be found in {{harv|Nestruev|2003}}.

== Topology ==
Suppose ''X'' is a compact [[Hausdorff space]], and C(''X'') is the ring of [[continuous function (topology)|continuous]] real-valued functions on ''X''. Analogous to the result above, the category of real vector bundles on ''X'' is equivalent to the category of finitely generated projective modules over C(''X''). The same result holds if one replaces "real-valued" by "complex-valued" and "real vector bundle" by "complex vector bundle", but it does not hold if one replace the field by a [[totally disconnected]] field like the [[rational number]]s.

In detail, let Vec(''X'') be the [[category theory|category]] of [[complex vector bundle]]s over ''X'', and let ProjMod(C(''X'')) be the category of [[finitely generated module|finitely generated]] projective modules over the [[Cstar algebra|C*-algebra]] C(''X''). There is a [[functor]] Γ : Vec(''X'') → ProjMod(C(''X'')) which sends each complex vector bundle ''E'' over ''X'' to the C(''X'')-module Γ(''X'', ''E'') of [[section (fiber bundle)|sections]]. If &lt;math&gt;\tau : (E_1, \pi_1) \to (E_2, \pi_2)&lt;/math&gt; is a [[Vector bundle#Vector bundle morphisms|morphism of vector bundles over ''X'']] then &lt;math&gt;\pi_2 \circ \tau = \pi_1&lt;/math&gt; and it follows that

:&lt;math&gt;\forall s \in \Gamma(X, E_1) \quad \pi_2 \circ \tau \circ s = \pi_1 \circ s = \text{id}_X,&lt;/math&gt;

giving the map 

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{cases} \Gamma \tau : \Gamma(X, E_1) \to \Gamma(X, E_2) \\ s \mapsto \tau \circ s \end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

which respects the module structure {{abbr|(Várilly, 97)|Várilly, Josef C. (1997), ''An introduction to noncommutative geometry'', eprint arXiv:physics/9709045v1 [math-ph]: 6-7. Retrieved 4 June 2015.}}. Swan's theorem asserts that the functor Γ is an [[equivalence of categories]].

==Algebraic geometry==
The analogous result in [[algebraic geometry]], due to {{harvtxt|Serre|1955|loc=§50}} applies to vector bundles in the category of [[affine variety|affine varieties]].  Let ''X'' be an affine variety with structure sheaf &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{O}_X,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}&lt;/math&gt; a [[coherent sheaf]] of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{O}_X&lt;/math&gt; -modules on ''X''.  Then &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}&lt;/math&gt; is the sheaf of germs of a finite-dimensional vector bundle if and only if &lt;math&gt;\Gamma(\mathcal{F}, X),&lt;/math&gt; the space of sections of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F},&lt;/math&gt; is a projective module over the commutative ring &lt;math&gt;A = \Gamma(\mathcal{O}_X, X).&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2207">A '''soliton distribution''' is a type of [[discrete probability distribution]] that arises in the theory of [[erasure correcting code]]s. A paper by Luby&lt;ref name="Luby"&gt;{{cite conference | last = Luby | first = M. | year = 2002 | url = http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/freeabs_all.jsp?arnumber=1181950 | title = LT Codes | conference = The 43rd Annual IEEE Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science }}&lt;/ref&gt; introduced two forms of such distributions, the '''ideal soliton distribution''' and the '''robust soliton distribution'''.

==Ideal distribution==
The '''ideal soliton distribution''' is a probability distribution on the integers from 1 to ''N'', where ''N'' is the single parameter of the distribution. The [[probability mass function]] is given by&lt;ref name=T&gt;{{cite paper | first = Tuomas | last = Tirronen | year = 2005 | citeseerx = 10.1.1.140.8104 | title = Optimal Degree Distributions for LT Codes in Small Cases | publisher = Helsinki University of Technology }}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
p(1)= \frac{1}{N}, &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
p(k)= \frac{1}{k(k-1)} \qquad (k=2,3,\dots,N). \,
&lt;/math&gt;

==Robust distribution==
The '''robust''' form of distribution is defined by adding an extra set of values to the elements of mass function of the ideal soliton distribution and then standardising so that the values add up to 1. The extra set of values, ''t'', are defined in terms of an additional real-valued parameter ''δ'' (which is interpreted as a failure probability) and an integer parameter ''M'' (''M'' &amp;lt; ''N'') . Define ''R'' as ''R''=''N''/''M''. Then the values added to ''p''(''i''), before the final standardisation, are&lt;ref name=T/&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
t(i)= \frac{1}{iM}, \qquad  \qquad  (i=1,2,\dots,M-1), \,
&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
t(i)= \frac{\ln(R/\delta)}{M}, \qquad (i=M), \,
&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
t(i)= 0, \qquad  \qquad (i=M+1,\dots,N). \,
&lt;/math&gt;
While the ideal soliton distribution has a [[mode (statistics)|mode]] (or spike) at 1, the effect of the extra component in the robust distribution is to add an additional spike at the value ''M''.

'''System F''', also known as the ('''Girard–Reynolds''') '''polymorphic lambda calculus''' or the '''second-order lambda calculus''', is a [[typed lambda calculus]] that differs from the [[simply typed lambda calculus]] by the introduction of a mechanism of universal quantification over types. System F thus formalizes the notion of [[parametric polymorphism]] in [[programming language]]s, and forms a theoretical basis for languages such as [[Haskell (programming language)|Haskell]] and [[ML (programming language)|ML]]. System F was discovered independently by [[logician]] [[Jean-Yves Girard]] (1972) and [[computer scientist]] [[John C. Reynolds]] (1974).

Whereas [[simply typed lambda calculus]] has variables ranging over functions, and binders for them, System F additionally has variables ranging over ''types'', and binders for them. As an example, the fact that the identity function can have any type of the form A→ A would be formalized in System F as the judgment

:&lt;math&gt;\vdash \Lambda\alpha. \lambda x^\alpha.x: \forall\alpha.\alpha \to \alpha&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is a '''[[type variable]]'''.  The upper-case &lt;math&gt;\Lambda&lt;/math&gt; is traditionally used to denote type-level functions, as opposed to the lower-case &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; which is used for value-level functions. (The superscripted &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; means that the bound ''x'' is of type &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;; the expression after the colon is the type of the lambda expression preceding it.)

As a [[term rewriting system]], System F is [[Normalization property (lambda-calculus)|strongly normalizing]]. However, type inference in System F (without explicit type annotations) is undecidable. Under the [[Curry–Howard isomorphism]], System F corresponds to the fragment of second-order [[intuitionistic logic]] that uses only universal quantification. System F can be seen as part of the [[lambda cube]], together with even more expressive typed lambda calculi, including those with [[dependent types]].

According to Girard, the "F" in ''System F'' was picked by chance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Girard|first=Jean-Yves|date=|title=The system F of variable types, fifteen years later|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/0304397586900447|journal=Theoretical Computer Science|volume=45|page=160|pages=|doi=10.1016/0304-3975(86)90044-7|quote=However, in [3] it was shown that the obvious rules of conversion for this system, called F by chance, were converging.|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Logic and predicates ==
The &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \mathsf{Boolean}&lt;/math&gt; type is defined as:
&lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle\forall\alpha.\alpha \to \alpha \to \alpha&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is a [[type variable]]. This means: &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \mathsf{Boolean}&lt;/math&gt; is the type of all functions which take as input a type &amp;alpha; and two expressions of type &amp;alpha;, and produce as output an expression of type &amp;alpha; (note that we consider &lt;math&gt;\to&lt;/math&gt; to be [[right-associative]].)

The following two definitions for the boolean values &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle\mathbf{T}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle\mathbf{F}&lt;/math&gt; are used, extending the definition of [[Church encoding#Church Booleans|Church booleans]]:

: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{T} = \Lambda\alpha{.}\lambda x^{\alpha} \lambda y^\alpha{.}x&lt;/math&gt; &lt;!-- These didn't render without the {}-wrapped around the . --&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F} = \Lambda\alpha{.}\lambda x^{\alpha} \lambda y^{\alpha}{.}y&lt;/math&gt;

(Note that the above two functions require ''three'' &amp;mdash; not two &amp;mdash; parameters. The latter two should be lambda expressions, but the first one should be a type. This fact is reflected in the fact that the type of these expressions is &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle\forall\alpha.\alpha \to \alpha \to \alpha&lt;/math&gt;; the universal quantifier binding the &amp;alpha; corresponds to the &amp;Lambda; binding the alpha in the lambda expression itself. Also, note that &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle\mathsf{Boolean}&lt;/math&gt; is a convenient shorthand for &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle\forall\alpha.\alpha \to \alpha \to \alpha&lt;/math&gt;, but it is not a symbol of System F itself, but rather a "meta-symbol". Likewise, &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \mathbf{T}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \mathbf{F}&lt;/math&gt; are also "meta-symbols", convenient shorthands, of System F "assemblies" (in the [https://books.google.com/books?id=IL-SI67hjI4C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Nicolas+Bourbaki&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=nbfmxi9gJK&amp;sig=4nPo8EFXrQYwAC2y0pD0uGv-EGY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=3sYBUOukIMLW2AX4t_inCw&amp;ved=0CD8Q6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=Nicolas%20Bourbaki&amp;f=false Bourbaki sense]); otherwise, if such functions could be named (within System F), then there would be no need for the lambda-expressive apparatus capable of defining functions anonymously.)

Then, with these two &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle\lambda&lt;/math&gt;-terms, we can define some logic operators (which are of type &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \mathsf{Boolean} \rightarrow \mathsf{Boolean} \rightarrow \mathsf{Boolean}&lt;/math&gt;):
: &lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\mathrm{AND} &amp;= \lambda x^{\mathsf{Boolean}} \lambda y^{\mathsf{Boolean}}{.} x y\, \mathbf{F}\\
\mathrm{OR}  &amp;= \lambda x^{\mathsf{Boolean}} \lambda y^{\mathsf{Boolean}}{.} x \mathbf{T}\, y\\
\mathrm{NOT} &amp;= \lambda x^{\mathsf{Boolean}}{.} x \mathbf{F}\, \mathbf{T} 
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

As in Church encodings, there is no need for an &lt;tt&gt;IFTHENELSE&lt;/tt&gt; function as one can just use raw &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle\mathsf{Boolean}&lt;/math&gt;-typed terms as decision functions. However, if one is requested:
: &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{IFTHENELSE} = \Lambda \alpha.\lambda x^{\mathsf{Boolean}}\lambda y^{\alpha}\lambda z^{\alpha}. x \alpha y z &lt;/math&gt;
will do.
A ''predicate'' is a function which returns a &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle\mathsf{Boolean}&lt;/math&gt;-typed value. The most fundamental predicate is &lt;tt&gt;ISZERO&lt;/tt&gt; which returns &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle\mathbf{T}&lt;/math&gt; if and only if its argument is the [[Church encoding#Church numerals|Church numeral]]  &lt;tt&gt;0&lt;/tt&gt;:
: &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{ISZERO} = \lambda n^{\forall \alpha. (\alpha \rightarrow \alpha) \rightarrow \alpha \rightarrow \alpha}{.}n^{\mathsf{Boolean}} (\lambda x^{\mathsf{Boolean}}{.}\mathbf{F})\, \mathbf{T}&lt;/math&gt;

==System F structures==

System F allows recursive constructions to be embedded in a natural manner, related to that in [[Martin-Löf's type theory]]. Abstract structures (S) are created using ''constructors''. These are functions typed as:
:&lt;math&gt;K_1\rightarrow K_2\rightarrow\dots\rightarrow S&lt;/math&gt;.

Recursivity is manifested when &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; itself appears within one of the types &lt;math&gt;K_i&lt;/math&gt;. If you have &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; of these constructors, you can define the type of &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; as:
:&lt;math&gt;\forall \alpha.(K_1^1[\alpha/S]\rightarrow\dots\rightarrow \alpha)\dots\rightarrow(K_1^m[\alpha/S]\rightarrow\dots\rightarrow \alpha)\rightarrow \alpha&lt;/math&gt;

For instance, the natural numbers can be defined as an inductive datatype &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; with constructors
: &lt;math&gt;\mathit{zero} : \mathrm{N}&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\mathit{succ} : \mathrm{N} \rightarrow \mathrm{N}&lt;/math&gt;
The System F type corresponding to this structure is
&lt;math&gt;\forall \alpha. \alpha \to (\alpha \to \alpha) \to \alpha&lt;/math&gt;.  The terms of this type comprise a typed version of the [[Church numeral]]s, the first few of which are:
: &lt;tt&gt;0 := &lt;/tt&gt;&lt;math&gt;\Lambda \alpha . \lambda x^\alpha . \lambda f^{\alpha\to\alpha} . x&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;tt&gt;1 := &lt;/tt&gt;&lt;math&gt;\Lambda \alpha . \lambda x^\alpha . \lambda f^{\alpha\to\alpha} . f x&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;tt&gt;2 := &lt;/tt&gt;&lt;math&gt;\Lambda \alpha . \lambda x^\alpha . \lambda f^{\alpha\to\alpha} . f (f x)&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;tt&gt;3 := &lt;/tt&gt;&lt;math&gt;\Lambda \alpha . \lambda x^\alpha . \lambda f^{\alpha\to\alpha} . f (f (f x))&lt;/math&gt;

If we reverse the order of the curried arguments (''i.e.,'' &lt;math&gt;\forall \alpha. (\alpha \rightarrow \alpha) \rightarrow \alpha \rightarrow \alpha&lt;/math&gt;), then the Church numeral for &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is a function that takes a function &lt;tt&gt;''f''&lt;/tt&gt; as argument and returns the &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; power of &lt;tt&gt;''f''&lt;/tt&gt;. That is to say, a Church numeral is a [[higher-order function]] – it takes a single-argument function &lt;tt&gt;''f''&lt;/tt&gt;, and returns another single-argument function.

==Use in programming languages==

The version of System F used in this article is as an explicitly typed, or Church-style, calculus.  The typing information contained in λ-terms makes [[type-checking]] straightforward.  [[Joe Wells]] (1994) settled an "embarrassing open problem" by proving that type checking is [[decision problem|undecidable]] for a Curry-style variant of System F, that is, one that lacks explicit typing annotations.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.macs.hw.ac.uk/~jbw/research-summary.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.church-project.org/reports/Wells:APAL-1999-v98-no-note.html|title=The Church Project: Typability and type checking in {S}ystem {F} are equivalent and undecidable|date=29 September 2007|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929211126/http://www.church-project.org/reports/Wells:APAL-1999-v98-no-note.html|archivedate=29 September 2007|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wells's result implies that [[type inference]] for System F is impossible.
A restriction of System F known as "[[Hindley–Milner]]", or simply "HM", does have an easy type inference algorithm and is used for many [[statically typed]] [[functional programming languages]] such as [[Haskell (programming language)|Haskell 98]] and [[ML programming language|ML]]. Over time, as the restrictions of HM-style type systems have become apparent, languages have steadily moved to more expressive logics for their type systems. As of 2008, [[Glasgow Haskell Compiler|GHC]], a Haskell compiler, goes beyond HM, and now uses System F extended with non-syntactic type equality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ghc.haskell.org/trac/ghc/wiki/Commentary/Compiler/FC|title=Commentary/Compiler/FC – GHC|website=ghc.haskell.org|access-date=2016-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[F Sharp (programming_language)|F#]] is designed from scratch with System F in mind.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}

== System F&lt;sub&gt;ω&lt;/sub&gt; ==
While System F corresponds to the first axis of Barendregt's [[lambda cube]], '''System F&lt;sub&gt;ω&lt;/sub&gt;''' or the '''higher-order polymorphic lambda calculus''' combines the first axis (polymorphism) with the second axis ([[type operator]]s); it is a different, more complex system.

System F&lt;sub&gt;ω&lt;/sub&gt; can be defined inductively on a family of systems, where induction is based on the [[Kind (type theory)|kind]]s permitted in each system:

* &lt;math&gt;F_n&lt;/math&gt; permits kinds:
** &lt;math&gt;\star&lt;/math&gt; (the kind of types) and
** &lt;math&gt;J\Rightarrow K&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;J\in F_{n-1}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;K\in F_n&lt;/math&gt; (the kind of functions from types to types, where the argument type is of a lower order)

In the limit, we can define system &lt;math&gt;F_\omega&lt;/math&gt; to be

* &lt;math&gt;F_\omega = \underset{1 \leq i}{\bigcup} F_i&lt;/math&gt;

That is, F&lt;sub&gt;ω&lt;/sub&gt; is the system which allows functions from types to types where the argument (and result) may be of any order.

Note that although F&lt;sub&gt;ω&lt;/sub&gt; places no restrictions on the ''order'' of the arguments in these mappings, it does restrict the ''universe'' of the arguments for these mappings: they must be types rather than values.  System F&lt;sub&gt;ω&lt;/sub&gt; does not permit mappings from values to types ([[Dependent types]]), though it does permit mappings from values to values (&lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; abstraction), mappings from types to values (&lt;math&gt;\Lambda&lt;/math&gt; abstraction, sometimes written &lt;math&gt;\forall&lt;/math&gt;) and mappings from types to types (&lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; abstraction at the level of types)

The index is known by several other names, especially ''Sørensen–Dice index'', ''Sørensen index'' and ''Dice's coefficient''.

==Formula==
Sørensen's original formula was intended to be applied to binary data. Given two sets, X and Y, it is defined as

:&lt;math&gt; DSC =  \frac{2 |X \cap Y|}{|X|+ |Y|}&lt;/math&gt;

where |''X''| and |''Y''| are the [[Cardinality|cardinalities]] of the two sets (i.e. the number of elements in each set).
The Sørensen index equals twice the number of elements common to both sets divided by the sum of the number of elements in each set.

When applied to boolean data, using the definition of true positive (TP), false positive (FP), and false negative (FN), it can be written as

:&lt;math&gt; DSC = \frac{2 TP}{2 TP + FP + FN}&lt;/math&gt;.

It is different from the [[Jaccard index]] which only counts true positives once in both the numerator and denominator. DSC is the quotient of similarity and ranges between 0 and&amp;nbsp;1.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sekj.org/PDF/anbf40/anbf40-415.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; It can be viewed as a [[similarity measure]] over sets.

Similarly to the [[Jaccard index]], the set operations can be expressed in terms of vector operations over binary vectors '''a''' and '''b''':

:&lt;math&gt;s_v = \frac{2 | \bf{a} \cdot \bf{b} |}{| \bf{a} |^2 + | \bf{b} |^2} &lt;/math&gt;

which gives the same outcome over binary vectors and also gives a more general similarity metric over vectors in general terms.

For sets ''X'' and ''Y'' of keywords used in [[information retrieval]], the coefficient may be defined as twice the shared information (intersection) over the sum of cardinalities :&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=van Rijsbergen |first=Cornelis Joost |year=1979
|title=Information Retrieval
|url=http://www.dcs.gla.ac.uk/Keith/Preface.html |publisher=Butterworths |location=London |isbn=3-642-12274-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When taken as a [[String (computer science)|string]] similarity measure, the coefficient may be calculated for two strings, ''x'' and ''y'' using [[bigram]]s as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |last=Kondrak |first=Grzegorz |author2=Marcu, Daniel |author3= Knight, Kevin  |year=2003
|title=Cognates Can Improve Statistical Translation Models
|booktitle=Proceedings of HLT-NAACL 2003: Human Language Technology Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics
|pages=46–48 |url=http://aclweb.org/anthology/N/N03/N03-2016.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;s = \frac{2 n_t}{n_x + n_y}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''n''&lt;sub&gt;''t''&lt;/sub&gt; is the number of character bigrams found in both strings, ''n''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt; is the number of bigrams in string ''x'' and ''n''&lt;sub&gt;''y''&lt;/sub&gt; is the number of bigrams in string ''y''. For example, to calculate the similarity between:

:&lt;code&gt;night&lt;/code&gt;
:&lt;code&gt;nacht&lt;/code&gt;

We would find the set of bigrams in each word:
:{&lt;code&gt;ni&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;code&gt;ig&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;code&gt;gh&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;code&gt;ht&lt;/code&gt;}
:{&lt;code&gt;na&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;code&gt;ac&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;code&gt;ch&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;code&gt;ht&lt;/code&gt;}

Each set has four elements, and the intersection of these two sets has only one element: &lt;code&gt;ht&lt;/code&gt;.

Inserting these numbers into the formula, we calculate, ''s''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;(2&amp;nbsp;·&amp;nbsp;1)&amp;nbsp;/&amp;nbsp;(4&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;4)&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0.25.

==Difference from Jaccard ==
This coefficient is not very different in form from the [[Jaccard index]]. In fact, both are equivalent in the sense that given a value for the Sørensen–Dice coefficient &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;, one can calculate the respective Jaccard index value &lt;math&gt;J&lt;/math&gt; and vice versa, using the equations &lt;math&gt;J=S/(2-S)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;S=2J/(1+J)&lt;/math&gt;.

Since the Sørensen–Dice coefficient doesn't satisfy the triangle inequality, it can be considered a [[Metric (mathematics)#Generalized metrics|semimetric]] version of the Jaccard index.&lt;ref name ="gallagher"/&gt;

The function ranges between zero and one, like Jaccard. Unlike Jaccard, the corresponding difference function

:&lt;math&gt;d = 1 -  \frac{2 | X \cap Y |}{| X | + | Y |} &lt;/math&gt;

is not a proper distance metric as it does not possess the property of [[triangle inequality]].&lt;ref name ="gallagher"&gt;Gallagher, E.D., 1999. [http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.9.1334&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf COMPAH Documentation], University of Massachusetts, Boston&lt;/ref&gt; The simplest counterexample of this is given by the three sets {a}, {b}, and {a,b}, the distance between the first two being 1, and the difference between the third and each of the others being one-third. To satisfy the triangle inequality, the sum of ''any'' two of these three sides must be greater than or equal to the remaining side. However, the distance between {a} and {a,b} plus the distance between {b} and {a,b} equals 2/3 and is therefore less than the distance between {a} and {b} which is 1.

==Applications==
The Sørensen–Dice coefficient is useful for ecological community data (e.g. Looman &amp; Campbell, 1960&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Looman | first1 = J. | last2 = Campbell | first2 = J.B. | year = 1960 | title = Adaptation of Sorensen's K (1948) for estimating unit affinities in prairie vegetation | journal = Ecology | volume = 41 | issue = 3| pages = 409–416 | jstor=1933315 | doi = 10.2307/1933315 }}&lt;/ref&gt;). Justification for its use is primarily  empirical rather than theoretical (although it can be justified  theoretically as the intersection of two [[fuzzy set]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Roberts | first1 = D.W. | year = 1986 | title = Ordination on the basis of fuzzy set theory | doi = 10.1007/BF00039905 | journal = Vegetatio | volume = 66 | issue = 3| pages = 123–131 }}&lt;/ref&gt;). As compared to [[Euclidean distance]], the Sørensen distance retains sensitivity in more heterogeneous data sets and gives less weight to outliers.&lt;ref&gt;McCune, Bruce &amp; Grace, James (2002) Analysis of Ecological Communities. Mjm Software Design; {{ISBN|0-9721290-0-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Recently the Dice score (and its variations, e.g. logDice taking a logarithm of it) has become popular in computer [[lexicography]] for measuring the lexical association score of two given words.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nlp.fi.muni.cz/raslan/2008/raslan08.pdf#page=14 Rychlý, P. (2008) A lexicographer-friendly association score. Proceedings of the Second Workshop on Recent Advances in Slavonic Natural Language Processing RASLAN 2008: 6–9]&lt;/ref&gt; It is also commonly used in [[image segmentation]], in particular for comparing algorithm output against reference masks in medical applications.&lt;ref name ="zijdenbos"/&gt;

==Abundance version==
The expression is easily extended to [[Abundance (ecology)|abundance]] instead of presence/absence of species. This quantitative version is known by several names:

'''''Vectorial Mechanics''''' (1948) is a book on vector manipulation (i.e., vector methods) by [[Arthur Milne|Edward Arthur Milne]], a highly decorated (e.g., [[James Scott Prize Lectureship]]) British astrophysicist and mathematician. Milne states that the text was due to conversations (circa 1924) with his then-colleague and erstwhile teacher [[Sydney Chapman (astronomer)|Sydney Chapman]] who viewed vectors not merely as a pretty [[toy weapon|toy]] but as a powerful [[weapon]] of [[applied mathematics]].  Milne states that he did not at first believe Chapman, holding on to the idea that "vectors were like a pocket-rule, which needs to be unfolded before it can be applied and used." In time, however, Milne convinces himself that Chapman was right.&lt;ref&gt;''Vectorial Mechanics'' Preface page vii&lt;/ref&gt;

==Summary==
''Vectorial Mechanics'' has 18 chapters grouped into 3 parts.  Part I is on ''vector algebra'' including chapters on a definition of a vector, products of vectors, elementary tensor analysis, and integral theorems.  Part II is on ''systems of line vectors'' including chapters on line co-ordinates, systems of line vectors, statics of rigid bodies, the displacement of a rigid body, and the work of a system of line vectors.  Part III is on ''dynamics'' including [[kinematics]], particle dynamics, types of particle motion, dynamics of systems of particles, [[rigid bodies]] in motion, dynamics of rigid bodies, motion of a rigid body about its [[center of mass]], gyrostatic problems, and impulsive motion.

==Summary of reviews==
There were significant reviews given near the time of original publication.

'''[[Gerald James Whitrow|G.J.Whitrow]]:'''
&lt;blockquote&gt; Although many books have been published in recent years in which vector and [[tensor]] methods are used for solving problems in geometry and [[mathematical physics]], there has been a lack of first-class treatises which explain the methods in full detail and are nevertheless suitable for the undergraduate student.  In applied mathematics no book has appeared till now which is comparable with [[G.H. Hardy|Hardy's]] ''[[A Course of Pure Mathematics|Pure Mathematics]]''. ... Just as in Hardy's classic, a new note is struck at the very start: a precise definition is given of the concept "free vector", analogous to the Frege-Russell definition of "[[cardinal number]]."  According to Milne, a free vector is the class of all its representations, a typical representation being defined in the customary manner.  From a pedagogic point of view, however, the reviewer wonders whether it might have been better to draw attention at this early stage to a concrete instance of a ''free'' vector. The student familiar with physical concepts which have magnitude and position, but not direction, should be made to realise from the very beginning that the free vector is not merely "fundamental in discussing systems of position vectors and systems of line-vectors", but occurs naturally in its own right, as there are physical concepts which have magnitude and direction but not position, e.g. the [[Couple (mechanics)|couple]] in statics, and the [[angular velocity]] of a [[rigid body]]. Although the necessary existence theorems must be established at a later stage, and Milne's rigorous proofs are particularly welcome, there is no reason why some instances of free vectors should not be mentioned at this point."  &lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Daniel C. Lewis:''' 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The reviewer has long felt that the role of vector analysis in [[mechanics]] has been much overemphasized. It is true that the fundamental equations of motion in their various forms, especially in the case of [[rigid bodies]], can be derived with greatest economy of thought by use of vectors (assuming that the requisite technique has already been developed); but once the equations have been set up, the usual procedure is to drop vector methods in their solution. If this position can be successfully refuted, this has been done in the present work, the most novel feature of which is to solve the vector [[differential equations]] by vector methods without ever writing down the corresponding scalar differential equations obtained by taking components. The author has certainly been successful in showing that this can be done in fairly simple, though nontrivial, cases. To give an example of a definitely nontrivial problem solved in this way, one might mention the [[nonholonomic]] problem afforded by the motion of a sphere rolling on a rough [[inclined plane]] or on a rough spherical surface. The author's methods are interesting and aesthetically satisfying and therefore deserve the widest publication even if they partake of the nature of a tour de force.

{{distinguish|Well-ordering theorem}}
In [[mathematics]], the '''well-ordering principle''' states that every non-empty set of positive integers contains a [[least element]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Introduction to Analytic Number Theory |last=Apostol |first=Tom |authorlink=Tom M. Apostol |year=1976 |publisher=Springer-Verlag |location=New York |isbn=0-387-90163-9 |pages=13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, the set of positive integers is [[well-order]]ed.

The phrase "well-ordering principle" is sometimes taken to be synonymous with the "[[well-ordering theorem]]". On other occasions it is understood to be the proposition that the set of [[integers]] {…, −2, −1, 0, 1, 2, 3, …} contains a [[well-order|well-ordered]] subset, called the [[natural numbers]], in which every nonempty subset contains a least element.

Depending on the framework in which the natural numbers are introduced, this (second order) property of the set of natural numbers is either an [[axiom]] or a provable theorem. For example:
* In [[Peano arithmetic]], [[second-order arithmetic]] and related systems, and indeed in most (not necessarily formal) mathematical treatments of the well-ordering principle, the principle is derived from the principle of [[mathematical induction]], which is itself taken as basic. 
* Considering the natural numbers as a subset of the real numbers, and assuming that we know already that the real numbers are complete (again, either as an axiom or a theorem about the real number system), i.e., every bounded (from below) set has an infimum, then also every set ''A'' of natural numbers has an infimum, say ''a''*. We can now find an integer ''n''* such that ''a''* lies in the half-open interval (''n''*−1,&amp;nbsp;''n''*], and can then show that we must have ''a''*&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''n''*, and ''n''* in ''A''. 
* In [[axiomatic set theory]], the natural numbers are defined as the smallest [[Inductive set (axiom of infinity)|inductive set]] (i.e., set containing 0 and closed under the successor operation). One can (even without invoking the [[axiom of regularity|regularity axiom]]) show that the set of all natural numbers ''n'' such that "{0,&amp;nbsp;…,&amp;nbsp;''n''} is well-ordered" is inductive, and must therefore contain all natural numbers; from this property one can conclude that the set of all natural numbers is also well-ordered. 

In the second sense, this phrase is used when that proposition is relied on for the purpose of justifying proofs that take the following form: to prove that every natural number belongs to a specified set S, assume the contrary, which implies that the set of counterexamples is non-empty and thus contains a smallest counterexample.  Then show that for any counterexample there is a still smaller counterexample, producing a contradiction.  This mode of argument is the [[contrapositive]] of proof by [[complete induction]]. It is known light-heartedly as the "[[minimal criminal]]" method and is similar in its nature to [[Fermat|Fermat's]] method of "[[infinite descent]]".

[[Garrett Birkhoff]] and [[Saunders Mac Lane]] wrote in ''A Survey of Modern Algebra'' that this property, like the [[least upper bound axiom]] for real numbers, is non-algebraic; i.e., it cannot be deduced from the algebraic properties of the integers (which form an ordered [[integral domain]]).

In [[mathematics]], the '''Whitney umbrella''' (or '''Whitney's umbrella''', named after American mathematician [[Hassler Whitney]], and sometimes called a '''Cayley umbrella''') is a specific self-intersecting [[Surface (topology)|surface]] placed in [[dimension|three dimensions]].  It is the union of all straight lines that pass through points of a fixed [[parabola]] and are perpendicular to a fixed straight line, parallel to the axis of the parabola and lying on its [[bisection|perpendicular bisecting plane]].

==Formulas==
Whitney's umbrella can be given by the [[parametric equation]]s in [[Cartesian coordinates]]
&lt;math&gt;
x(u,v) = uv 
&lt;/math&gt;;
&lt;math&gt;
y(u,v) = u 
&lt;/math&gt;;
&lt;math&gt;
z(u,v) = v^2
&lt;/math&gt;
where the parameters ''u'' and ''v'' range over the [[real number]]s.  It is also given by the [[implicit function|implicit equation]]
: &lt;math&gt;x^2-y^2z=0&lt;/math&gt;
This formula also includes the negative ''z'' axis (which is called the ''handle'' of the umbrella).

==Properties==
[[Image:Whitney_umbrella.gif|right|thumb|5400px|Whitney umbrella as a ruled surface, generated by a moving straight line.]]

[[Image:Whitney umbrella.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Whitney umbrella made with a single string inside a  plastic cube.]]

Whitney's umbrella is a [[ruled surface]] and a [[right conoid]]. It is important in the field of [[singularity theory]], as a simple [[Local property|local]] model of a [[pinch point (mathematics)|pinch point]] [[mathematical singularity|singularity]]. The pinch point and the [[fold catastrophe|fold singularity]] are the only [[stable singularity|stable local singularities]] of maps from '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; to '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.

It is named after the [[United States|American]] [[mathematician]] [[Hassler Whitney]].

In [[string theory]], a [[Whitney brane]] is a D7-brane wrapping a variety whose  singularities  are locally modeled by the Whitney umbrella. Whitney branes appear naturally when taking Sen's weak coupling limit of [[F-theory]].
