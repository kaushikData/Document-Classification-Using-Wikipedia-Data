{{wiktionary|B roll}}

In film and television production, '''B-roll''', '''B roll''', '''B-reel''' or '''B reel''' is supplemental or alternative [[footage]] intercut with the main shot.&lt;ref name="Bowen and Thompson 2011"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Rl7IyLPt5ucC&amp;pg=PA240 |page=240 |last=Bowen |first=Christopher J. |last2=Thompson |first2=Roy |title=Grammar of the Shot |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |date=2011 |isbn=9780240526010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''A-roll'' referring to the main footage has fallen out of usage.&lt;ref name="Compesi and Gomez 2014"/&gt;

==Film and video production==
Films and videos may [[Cutaway (filmmaking)|cut away from the main story]] to show related scenery or action. [[Establishing shot]]s may be used to show the audience the context of the story. These secondary images are often presented without sound, as the sound from the primary footage is expected to continue while the other images are shown. The various shots presented without sound are called ''B-roll''.&lt;ref name="Irving and Rea 2014"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6pvcAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA172 |page=172 |title=Producing and Directing the Short Film and Video |first1=David K. |last1=Irving |first2=Peter W. |last2=Rea |publisher=CRC Press |year=2014 |isbn=9781136048425}}&lt;/ref&gt;

B-roll may be shot by smaller [[second unit]] crews, since there is no need for sound. In film, smaller [[MOS (filmmaking)|MOS]] cameras may be used for greater portability and ease of setup.&lt;ref name="Irving and Rea 2014"/&gt; In [[electronic news-gathering]] (ENG) and [[documentary film]] projects, B-roll footage is often shot after the main interview is shot, to provide supporting scenes for what was said by the interview subject.&lt;ref name="Compesi and Gomez 2014"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=K5vhCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA268 |page=268 |last=Compesi |first=Ronald |last2=Gomez |title=Introduction to Video Production: Studio, Field, and Beyond |publisher=CRC Press |date=2015 |isbn=9781317347156}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a [[docudrama]] project, B-roll may refer to dramatic re-enactment scenes staged by the producer and performed by actors, to be used as cutaway shots.&lt;ref name=Wales2017&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=giglDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA17 |page=17 |last=Wales |first=Lorena M. |title=The Complete Guide to Film and Digital Production: The People and The Process |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |date=2017 |isbn=9781315294889}}&lt;/ref&gt;

B-roll footage may be added to or drawn from a [[stock footage]] library.&lt;ref name="Bowen and Thompson 2011"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Wales2017/&gt;

==History==
===16 mm film splices===
The term ''B-roll'' originates from a particular solution to the problem of visible splices in the narrow [[film stock]] used in [[16&amp;nbsp;mm film]]. 35&amp;nbsp;mm film was wide enough to hide splices, but 16&amp;nbsp;mm film revealed the splices as flaws in the picture. To avoid this problem, the intended shots were spliced to [[Film leader|opaque black leader]], with the black leader hiding the splice. Two sequences of shots were assembled, the odd-numbered shots on the A-roll, and the even-numbered shots on the B-roll, such that all of the shots on one roll were matched by black leader on the other roll, in a checkerboard pattern (an alternate name for the process was "checkerboard printing".) Unexposed 16 mm raw print stock was [[Exposure (photography)|exposed]] twice, once to the A-roll, then it was exposed again to the B-roll.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3NFAbjYD8MkC&amp;pg=PA669 |page=669 |title=The Filmmaker's Handbook: A Comprehensive Guide for the Digital Age |first=Steven |last=Ascher |first2=Edward |last2=Pincus |publisher=Penguin |date=2007 |isbn=9780452286788}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WRklp-TmfQkC&amp;pg=PA108 |page=108 |title=Film Technology in Post Production |first=Dominic |last=Case |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |date=April 26, 2013 |isbn=9781136049781}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Spottiswoode, Raymond (1966), ''Film and its techniques''. U. Cal Press. Chapter 1, p 44.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Telecine transfer===
Until the mid-1970s, ENG teams shot both main A-roll and secondary B-roll footage on 16&amp;nbsp;mm film. [[Sound on film|Sound was integrated onto the film]] by way of a magnetic stripe at the edge of the film. The A-roll and B-roll scenes, shot at 24 frames per second, were converted to the television frame rate of 30&amp;nbsp;fps using a [[telecine]] system consisting of two film projectors, one showing the main A-roll footage and the other showing the B-roll. The sound from the A-roll footage was used, or sound from narration or voiceover, while MOS images from the B-roll were intercut as desired.&lt;ref name="Compesi and Gomez 2014"/&gt;

===Linear video tape editing===
In the 1980s, the term ''B-roll'' was adopted for [[linear video editing]] using at least two video tape machines. Traditionally, the [[Tape recorder|tape decks]] in an edit suite were labeled by letter, with the 'A' deck being the one containing the main tape upon which the main action material was shot. The 'B' deck was used to run tapes that held additional footage such as establishing shots, cutaway shots, and any other supporting footage. The sound was usually taken from the A deck alone, so that the B deck provided video without sound.&lt;ref name="Irving and Rea 2014"/&gt; As linear editing systems were unable to dissolve between clips on the same tape, an [[edit decision list]] (EDL) was used to mark clips as "A-roll" and "B-roll" to indicate source machines.

'''Bakhmut''' ({{lang-uk|Ба́хмут}}, {{lang-ru|Бахмут}}) formerly '''Artemivsk/Artyomovsk''' ({{lang-uk|Артемівськ|links=no}}, {{lang-ru|Артёмовск|links=no}}), is a [[City of regional significance (Ukraine)|city of regional significance]] in [[Donetsk Oblast]], [[Ukraine]]. On 4 February 2016 the [[Verkhovna Rada]] of Ukraine confirmed the name change of the city by returning to the original one.&lt;ref name="rename1"&gt;[http://www.unian.info/society/1255225-decommunisation-continues-rada-renames-several-towns-and-villages.html Decommunisation continues: Rada renames several towns and villages], [[UNIAN]] (4 February 2016)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=rename&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pravda.com.ua/news/2016/02/4/7097833/|title=Rada de-communized Artemivsk as well as over hundred cities and villages|date=4 February 2016|publisher=[[Ukrayinska Pravda]]|language=Ukrainian|accessdate=4 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The city serves as an [[administrative center]] of [[Bakhmut Raion]] although it does not belong to the raion. It is located on the Bakhmutka River about 89&amp;nbsp;km away from the administrative center of the Donetsk Oblast, [[Donetsk]]. Population: {{Ua-pop-est2015|77,177}}

Bakhmut was a capital of [[Slavo-Serbia]], which was established by Austrian migrants from Serbia. In 1920–24, the city was an administrative center of [[Donets Governorate]] of the [[Ukrainian SSR]].

==History==
There is evidence of prior settlement in 1556. However, officially it was founded in 1571 and named as Bakhmut fort after the river Bakhmutka (a tributary of the [[Seversky Donets River|Seversky Donets]]) on which it is situated. The settlement initially began as a border point and was later turned into a fortification. The name derived from Tatar name Mahmud or Mahmet. In 1701, [[Peter the Great|Peter I]] ordered to build a fort and rename the town from Bahmut to Bakhmut. The fort was completed in 1703. In 1704 Peter the Great issued a ukase permitting Cossacks to settle in Bakhmut.

In the autumn of 1705, a detachment of [[Cossacks]] headed by Ataman [[Kondraty Bulavin]] captured the Bakhmut salt mines,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.krugosvet.ru/enc/istoriya/VOSSTANIE_KRESTYAN_I_KAZAKOV_POD_RUKOVODSTVOM_KONDRATIYA_AFANASEVICHA_BULAVINA.html Rebellion of peasants and Cossacks under the leadership of Bulavin] {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; which later caused the town to be one of the centers of the [[Bulavin Rebellion]], and held the city until March 7, 1708 when it was seized by government troops. From 1708 to April 22, 1725, Bakhmut is situated in the [[Azov Governorate]], and on May 29, 1719 becomes the administrative center of Bakhmut Province within the governorate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.history.org.ua/?termin=Bakhmutska_provintsiia|title=Інститут історії України НАН України|work=history.org.ua|accessdate=9 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1753 to 1764, it was a main city of the [[Slavo-Serbia]] territory inhabited by colonists from [[Serbia]] and elsewhere.

In 1783, Bakhmut received city status within the Yekaterinoslav province ([[Novorossiysk Governorate]]).&lt;ref name=hd&gt;{{cite book|title=Brockhaus and Efron Encyclopedia Dictionary|year=1903|author=|publisher=|page=|url=| isbn= |language=ru}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this time, in the city, there were 49 houses, five brick, candle, and soap factories. The city had about 150 shops, a hospital, and three schools: two private boarding schools for children of wealthy parents, and a Sunday school for children of workers. Bakhmut had a large shopping center. There twice a year, on July 12 (Day of the Apostles Peter and Paul) and September 21 (Day of the Nativity of the Blessed Virgin Mary), big fairs were conducted. The city's annual turnover was about 1 million rubles. On August 2, 1811, the city emblem was approved. In 1875, a water-system was installed.

On January 25, 1851, the city became a municipality, with Vasily I. Pershin as mayor. In 1876, within the Bakhmut Basin were discovered large deposits of rock salt, which was followed by a rapid increase in the numbers of mines, with salt productions reaching 12% nationwide. After the construction of a rail route Kharkov-Bakhmut-Popasnaya, there was enterprise for the production of [[alabaster]], [[plaster]], [[brick]], [[tile]], and [[soda ash]]. At the beginning of the twentieth century, the city developed metal-working. By 1900, the city had 76 small industrial enterprises, which employed 1,078 workers, as well as four [[salt mines]], which employed 874 workers. In 1900, the streets became paved. By 1913, the population consisted of 28,000 people. There were two hospitals with 210 beds, four secondary and two vocational schools, six single-class schools, four parish schools, and a private library.

In April 1918 troops loyal to the [[Ukrainian People's Republic]] took control of Bakhmut.&lt;ref&gt;{{uk icon}} [http://www.istpravda.com.ua/short/2018/04/18/152320/ 100 years ago Bakhmut and the rest of Donbass liberated], [[Ukrayinska Pravda]] (18 April 2018)&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 27, 1919, Soviet power is established within the city. In 1923, there were 36 enterprises, including a factory "Victory of Labor" (a former nail-spike factory), a factory "Lightning" that produced castings for agriculture, as well as brick, tile, and alabaster factories; mines "Karl Liebknecht and Sverdlov", "Shevchenko", and "Bakhmut salt"; and a shoe factory. From April 16, 1920 to August 1, 1925, Bakhmut is the administrative center of the Donetsk province.

In 1924 the city's name was changed from Bakhmut to '''Artemivsk''', in honour of [[Fyodor Sergeyev|Artyom]], a Russian [[Bolshevik]] (Communist) revolutionary figure who lived and worked in the city in the early years of the revolution.

'''Blowback''' in [[forensics]] refers to [[vacuum]] effect created in the [[Gun barrel|barrel]] of a [[firearm]] when it is discharged.

After the [[weapon]] is fired, [[air]] races into the barrel once the [[bullet]] has left the muzzle. This vacuum can pull in trace amounts of materials from the environment.

[[Police]] can use [[blood]] and [[Biological tissue|tissue]] which have entered a gun barrel through blowback in an investigation.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3054">The '''captain of the port''' is an official who has different functions in the [[United Kingdom]], the [[United States]], and other countries.

To some extent the role of captain of the port is analogous to that of a [[harbourmaster]].

==United Kingdom==
In the [[Royal Navy]], the captain of the port was the officer, usually with the rank of [[Captain (Royal Navy)|captain]], responsible for the day-to-day running of a [[Royal Navy Dockyard|Naval Dockyard]] under the authority of the [[admiral-superintendent]]. He usually also held the position of [[Queen's Harbourmaster|Queen's or King's harbourmaster]] and was directly responsible for the captain's department, which among other things operated the [[Admiralty Yard Craft Service|yard craft]].

From the 1650s until the mid-nineteenth century the position was known as '''master attendant''', and ranked immediately below that of Navy Commissioner. Occupants of the office were required to be "skilful in all affairs requisite in the looking after, equipping and setting out of State ships", for which they initially received an annual wage of between £90 and £100 plus accommodation.&lt;ref&gt;Hammond 1974, p. 119&lt;/ref&gt; The office was often combined with that of harbourmaster, and existed until the second half of the 19th century, when occupants (in common with Royal Naval [[Sailing Master|masters]]) began to be commissioned with the rank of staff captain. From the early twentieth century the equivalent appointment became '''staff captain (dockyard)''', then '''captain of the dockyard''', and finally captain of the port from 1969.

==United States==
{{main|Sector Commander}}
In the United States, captain of the port (COTP) is a title held by a [[United States Coast Guard]] officer, usually the [[Sector Commander|commander]] of a [[United States Coast Guard Sectors|United States Coast Guard sector]] with the rank of captain (O-6).  Captain of the port duties involve enforcing within their respective areas port safety and security and marine environmental protection regulations, including regulations for the protection and security of vessels, harbors, and waterfront facilities; anchorages; security zones; safety zones; regulated navigation areas; deepwater ports; water pollution; and ports and waterways safety.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ecfr.gpoaccess.gov/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=ecfr&amp;rgn=div8&amp;view=text&amp;node=33:1.0.1.1.1.1.1.3&amp;idno=33 Title 33, Code Federal Regulations, Part 1.01-30]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110613090551/http://ecfr.gpoaccess.gov/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=ecfr&amp;rgn=div8&amp;view=text&amp;node=33%3A1.0.1.1.1.1.1.3&amp;idno=33 |date=June 13, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1520">'''Catabiosis''' is the process of growing older, [[aging]] and physical degradation.

The word comes from Greek "kata"&amp;mdash;down, against, reverse and "biosis"&amp;mdash;way of life and is generally used to describe [[senescence]] and [[Degeneration (medical)|degeneration]] in living organisms and [[biophysics]] of aging in general.

One of the popular catabiotic theories is the [[entropy]] theory of aging, where aging is characterized by thermodynamically favourable increase in structural disorder. Living organisms are [[Thermodynamic system#Open system|open systems]] that take [[Thermodynamic free energy|free energy]] from the environment and offload their entropy as waste. However, basic components of living systems—[[DNA]], [[proteins]], [[lipids]] and [[sugars]]—tend towards the state of maximum entropy while continuously accumulating damages causing catabiosis of the living structure. 

[[Catabiotic force]] on the contrary is the influence exerted by living structures on adjoining cells, by which the latter are developed in harmony with the primary structures.

This theory concerns "(1) the behavioral changes that people make to attune their communication to their partner, and (2) the extent to which people perceive their partner as appropriately attuning to them."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bates|first1=James|last2=Taylor|first2=Alan|title=Grandparent–Grandchild Relationships|journal=The Wiley Blackwell Encyclopedia of Family Studies|date=2016|url=http://search.credoreference.com.db19.linccweb.org/content/entry/wileyfamily/grandparent_grandchild_relationships/0?institutionId=6086|accessdate=8 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This theory is concerned with the links between language, context, and identity.{{sfn|Gallois|Ogay|Giles|2005}} It focuses on both the intergroup and interpersonal factors that lead to accommodation, as well as the ways that power, macro and micro-context concerns affect communication behaviors.{{sfn|Gallois|Ogay|Giles|2005}}

== Background ==

=== Speech accommodation theory ===

The communication accommodation theory was developed by [[Howard Giles]], professor of Communication at the [[University of California, Santa Barbara]].{{sfn|Gallois|Ogay|Giles|2005}} The speech accommodation theory was developed to demonstrate all of the value of social psychological concepts to understanding the dynamics of speech.{{sfn|Giles|Coupland|Coupland|1991}} It sought to explain "... the motivations underlying certain shifts in people's speech styles during social encounters and some of the social consequences arising from them."{{sfn|Gallois|Ogay|Giles|2005}}Particularly, it focused on the cognitive and affective processes underlying individuals' convergence and divergence through speech. The communication accommodation theory has broadened this theory to include not only speech but also the "non-verbal and discursive dimensions of social interaction".{{sfn|Giles|Coupland|Coupland|1991}} CAT has also created a different perspective from other research in language and social interaction—and communication more generally—that focuses on either interpersonal or intergroup communication.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Social psychology and social identity theory ===

Like speech accommodation theory, communication accommodation theory continues to draw from [[social psychology]], particularly from four main socio-psychology theories: similarity-attraction, [[social exchange]], causal attribution and intergroup distinctiveness. These theories help to explain why speakers seek to converge or diverge from the language, dialect, accent and behavior of their interlocutors. CAT also relies heavily in [[social identity theory]]. This latter theory argues that a person's self-concept comprises a personal identity and a [[social identity]], and that this social identity is based in comparisons people make between in-groups (groups they belong to) and out-groups (groups they do not belong to).{{sfn|Turner|West|2010}} According to social identity theory, people strive to maintain a positive social identity by either joining groups where they feel more comfortable or making a more positive experience of belonging to the groups they already belong to. Since speech is a way to express group membership, people adopt convergence or divergence in communication to "signal a salient group distinctiveness, so as to reinforce a social identity".{{sfn|Gallois|Ogay|Giles|2005}} Communication accommodation thus, becomes a tool to emphasize group distinctiveness in a positive way, and strengthen the individual's social identity. There are four main socio-psychological theories:

====Similarity-attraction====
The similarity-attraction theory posits that "The more similar our attitudes and beliefs are to those of others, the more likely it is for them to be attracted to us."{{sfn|Giles|Smith|1979}} Convergence through verbal and non-verbal communication is one of the mechanisms that we can use to become more similar to others, increasing their attraction towards us.{{sfn|Giles|Smith|1979}} For this reason, it can be said that one of the factors that leads individuals to use convergence is a desire to obtain social approval from their interlocutor.{{sfn|Giles|St. Clair|1979}} It could hence be concluded that "the greater one's need for social approval, the greater will be one's tendency to converge".{{sfn|Giles|Smith|1979}} Natalé (1975), for instance, has found that speakers with high needs for approval converge more to another's vocal intensity and pause length than those with low needs for approval.{{sfn|Giles|St. Clair|1979}} An individual on the receiving end of high level of accommodation is likely to develop a greater sense of self-esteem and satisfaction than being a receiver of low accommodation.

====Social exchange process====
The social exchange process theory "... states that prior to acting, we attempt to assess the rewards and costs of alternate courses of action",{{sfn|Giles|St. Clair|1979}} and that we tend to choose whatever course of action will bring greater rewards and less costs. The Social Exchange Theory is a theory that looks at how people evaluate their relationships. Throughout the process of evaluating relationships, individuals want to feel as if they are receiving more from the relationship than they are expending within the relationship. In other words, people like to be in relationships where the rewards outweigh the costs. Although most often convergence can bring forth rewards, there are some occasions when it can also bring forth costs such as "increased effort to converge, a loss of perceived integrity and personal (and sometimes group) identity".{{sfn|Giles|Smith|1979}} Hence, when choosing whether or not to use convergence, people assess these costs and rewards.{{sfn|Giles|Smith|1979}}

====Causal attribution process====
The causal attribution theory "[s]uggests that we interpret other people's behavior, and evaluate the individual themselves, in terms of the motivations and intentions that we attribute as the cause of their behavior"{{sfn|Giles|St. Clair|1979}} It applies to convergence in that convergence might be viewed positively or negatively depending on the causes we attribute to it: "Although interpersonal convergence is generally favorably received, and non-convergence generally unfavorably received, the extent to which this holds true will undoubtedly be influenced by the listeners attributions of the speaker's intent."{{sfn|Giles|Smith|1979}} Giles and Smith provide the example of an experiment that they conducted amongst French and English speaking Canadians to illustrate this. In this experiment, when individuals believed that the person from the different group used language convergence to reduce cultural barriers, they evaluated it more positively than when they attributed it to the pressures of the situation. "When French Canadian listeners attributed an English Canadian's convergence to French as due to his desire to break down cultural barriers, the shift was viewed favorably. However, when this same behavior was attributed to pressures in the situation forcing the other to converge, positive feelings were not so strongly evoked."{{sfn|Giles|St. Clair|1979}}

====Intergroup distinctiveness====
The process of intergroup distinctiveness, as theorized by Tajfel argues, "... when members of different groups are in contact, they compare themselves on dimensions that are important to them, such as personal attributes, abilities, material possessions and so forth."{{sfn|Giles|St. Clair|1979}} In these "intergroup social comparisons" individuals seek to find ways to make themselves positively distinct from the out-group to enhance their social identity.{{sfn|Giles|Smith|1979}} Because speech style and language is an important factor in defining social groups, divergence in speech style or language is often used to maintain intergroup distinctiveness and differentiate from the out-group, especially when group membership is a salient issue or the individual's identity and group membership is being threatened.{{sfn|Giles|St. Clair|1979}}

== Assumptions ==
Many of the principles and concepts from [[social identity theory]] are also applicable to communication accommodation theory. Under the influence of social psychology, especially social identity theory, communication accommodation theory are guided by mainly four assumptions.

*There are speech and behavioral similarities and dissimilarities in all conversations.
*The way we perceive the speech and behaviors of another determines our evaluation of the conversation.
*Language and behaviors have the ability to communicate social status and group belonging between people in a conversation.
*Norms guide the accommodation process, which varies in its degree of appropriateness.{{sfn|Turner|West|2010}}

The first assumption indicates that people bring their past experience to conversations. Therefore, communication is influenced by situational conditions and initial reactions but also the "social-historical context in which the interaction is embedded".{{sfn|Giles|Ogay|2007}} People's attitudes and beliefs, derived from those factors, determine the extent to which they are willing to accommodate in a conversation. The more similarities that they share with each other, the more likely for them to accommodate.

The second assumption is concerned with how people perceive and evaluate a conversation. Perception is '"the process of attending to and interpreting a message'"{{sfn|Turner|West|2010}}, and evaluation is the "process of judging a conversation".{{sfn|Turner|West|2010}} Someone who enters a conversation usually first observes what takes place and then decides whether he should adjust to fit in. However, the decision about accommodation is not always necessary. If two strangers meet, they may have a random small talk and simply say goodbye. Then, neither of them is likely to evaluate the conversation since they have little chance of meeting again.

The importance of language and behavior is illustrated in the third assumption since they are indicators of social status and group belongings. When two people who speak different languages try to have a conversation, the language used is more likely to be the one used by the higher status person. That idea of "salient social membership"{{sfn|Giles|Ogay|2007}} negotiation is illustrated well during an interview as the interviewee usually makes all efforts to identify with the interviewer by accommodating the way that is spoken and behaved to raise the chance of getting the job.

The last assumption puts emphasis on social appropriateness and norms. Here, norms are defined as " expectations of behaviors that individuals feel should or should not occur in a conversation".{{sfn|Turner|West|2010}} Those expectations give guidance to people's behaviors, helping them to figure out the appropriate way to accommodate. Most of the time, the accommodation made according to those norms are perceived socially appropriate. For instance, when a young person talks to the seniors in the family, he should avoid using jargons among his generation to show respect and to communicate more smoothly.

== Convergence and divergence ==

=== Convergence ===

Convergence refers to the process through which an individual shifts speech patterns in interaction so that they more closely resemble the speech patterns of speech partners.{{sfn|Giles|Smith|1979}} People can converge through many features of communication such as their use of language, their "pronunciation, pause and utterance lengths, vocal intensities, non verbal behaviors, and intimacy of self disclosures"(Giles and Smith, 1979, 46), but they do not necessarily have to converge simultaneously at all of these levels. In fact, people can both converge at some levels and diverge through others at the same time.{{sfn|Giles|Coupland|Coupland|1991}} People use convergence based on their perceptions of others, as well as what they are able to infer about them and their backgrounds. Attraction (likability, charisma, credibility), also triggers convergence. As Turner and West note, "When communicators are attracted to others they will converge in their conversations."{{sfn|Turner|West|2010}} On the other hand, as the similarity attraction theory highlights, when people have similar beliefs, personality and behaviors they tend to be more attracted towards each other. To achieve a "desired social distance"(Pardo, 2016), people use language to converge more towards a conversational partner they are attracted to.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pardo|first=Jennifer S.|last2=Gibbons|first2=Rachel|last3=Suppes|first3=Alexandra|last4=Krauss|first4=Robert M.|date=2012-01-01|title=Phonetic convergence in college roommates|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0095447011000945|journal=Journal of Phonetics|volume=40|issue=1|pages=190–197|doi=10.1016/j.wocn.2011.10.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; The desire to make social interaction flow subsequently results in convergence. Many people tend to use converge with one another because they want to feel a sense of fitting in and experience social approval to the people around them. Thus, when one individual shifts speech and non-verbal behaviors in order to assimilate to the other it can result in a more favorable appraisal of him, that is: when convergence is perceived positively it is likely to enhance both the conversation and the attraction between the listener and the speaker. For this reason it could be said that convergence reflects "an individual's desire for social approval"{{sfn|Giles|Coupland|Coupland|1991}} from his interlocutor, and that the greater the individual's need for social approval, the more likely he or she is to converge. Besides attraction, other factors that "influence the intensity of this" need of approval and hence the level of convergence "include the probability of future interactions, the social status of the addressee, and interpersonal variability for need of social approval".{{sfn|Giles|Coupland|Coupland|1991}} Other factors that determine whether and to what extent individuals converge in interaction are their relational history, social norms and power variables.{{sfn|Turner|West|2010}} Because individuals are more likely to converge to the individual with the higher status it is likely that the speech in a conversation will reflect the speech of the individual with the higher status.{{sfn|Turner|West|2010}} Converging also increases the effectiveness of communication, which in turn lowers uncertainty, interpersonal anxiety, and increases mutual understanding. This is another factor that motivates people to converge.

=== Divergence ===

Divergence is a linguistic strategy whereby a member of a speech community accentuates the linguistic differences between himself and his interlocutor.{{sfn|Giles|Coupland|Coupland|1991}} "Given that communication features are often core dimensions of what it is to be a member of a group, divergence can be regarded as a very important tactic of displaying a valued distinctiveness from the other."{{sfn|Giles|Ogay|2007}} This helps to sustain a positive image of one's in-group and hence to strengthen one's social identity. Divergence is commonly used to establish dominance or power in an interaction. For example, if a recent college graduate becomes a professor, they might be teaching students who are around the same age as them. Therefore, it is important for the professor to communicate in a way that the students are aware the professor has more authority than them. Another case where there is a need for divergence are when professionals are with clients. In a 2001 study, doctors and patients discussed musculoskeletal disorders and it was observed that there were miscommunications that occurred because the participants chose to converge during the communication rather than to accentuate their position differences. Patients in the study felt more comfortable discussing their problems because they felt "positive about their doctor’s capacity to understand them".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Baker|first1=Susan C.|last2=Gallois|first2=Cindy|last3=Driedger|first3=S. Michelle|last4=Santesso|first4=Nancy|title=Communication Accommodation and Managing Musculoskeletal Disorders: Doctors' and Patients' Perspectives|journal=Health Communication|date=June 2011|volume=26|issue=4|pages=379–388|doi=10.1080/10410236.2010.551583}}&lt;/ref&gt; Communicating in a fashion to make speech different can also be interpreted as a sign of dislike towards a person or group.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  For example, "when you run into a disliked classmate from high school, your vocal pattern becomes more different from that classmate's."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Eadie|first1=William|title=Perspective Taking, Adaptation, and Coordination|journal=21st Century Communication: A Reference Handbook|date=2009|volume=1|pages=119–127}}&lt;/ref&gt; This represents the act of divergence because you are purposely changing your speech to not sound like that person.

== Components ==
Further research conducted by Gallois et al. in 1995 has expanded the theory to include 17 propositions that influence these processes of convergence and divergence. They are categorized into four main components: the ''sociohistorical context'', ''the communicators' accommodative orientation'', the ''immediate situation'' and ''evaluation and future intentions''.{{sfn|Gudykunst|2003}} These components are essential to Communication accommodation Theory and affect the course and outcome of intercultural conversations.

===Sociohistorical context===

The sociohistorical context refers to ways that past interactions between groups the communicators belong to influence the communication behaviors of the communicators. It includes "the relations between the groups having contact and the social norms regarding contact".{{sfn|Gudykunst|2003}} These relations between the different groups the communicators belong to influence the communicators' behavior. Socio-historical factors that influence communicators include political or historical relations between nations, and different religious or ideological views of the two groups participating in the conversation.

===Accommodative orientation===

Accommodative orientation refers to the communicator's "... tendencies to perceive encounters with out group members in interpersonal terms, intergroup terms, or a combination of the two".{{sfn|Gudykunst|2003}} There are three factors that are crucial to accommodative orientations: (1) "intrapersonal factors" (e.g. personality of the speakers), (2) "intergroup factors" (e.g. communicators' feelings toward outgroups), and (3) "initial orientations" (e.g., perceived potential for conflict).{{sfn|Gudykunst|2003}} Issues that influence this last factor include: collectivistic culture context or whether the culture is collectivistic or individualistic; distressing history of interaction, the possible tensions that exist between groups due to past interactions; stereotypes; norms for treatment of groups; and high group solidarity/ high group dependence, how dependent the person's self-worth is in the group.{{sfn|Griffin|2008|pp=387–399}}

===Immediate situation===

The immediate situation refers to the moment when the actual communication takes place. It is shaped by five interrelated aspects: (1) ''sociopsychological states'', (2) ''goals and addressee focus'' (e.g., motivations and goals for the encounter), (3) ''sociolinguistic strategies'' (e.g., convergence or divergence), (4) ''behavior and tactics'' (e.g., topic, accent) and (5) ''labeling and attributions''.{{sfn|Gudykunst|2003}}

===Evaluation and future intentions===

This aspect deals with how communicators perceive their conversational partners' behavior and its effects on future encounters between the two groups. Positively rated conversations will most likely lead to further communication between the interlocutors and other members of their respective groups.{{sfn|Gudykunst|2003}}

==In action==

In 1991, Giles, Coupland, and Coupland expressed the belief that a "more qualitative perspective" would be necessary to get more diverse and clarifying explanations of the behaviors presented within varying contexts.  They referred to this as "the applied perspective" that showed accommodation theory as a vital part of day-to-day activity as opposed to solely being a theoretical construct. They sought to "demonstrate how the core concepts and relationships invoked by accommodation theory are available for addressing altogether pragmatic concerns".{{sfn|Giles|Coupland|Coupland|1991}} For Giles, Coupland, and Coupland, these "pragmatic concerns" were extremely varied in nature.

One of these "pragmatic concerns" included understanding the relational issues that present themselves in the medical and clinical fields, such as the relational "alternatives, development, difficulties, and outcomes" that affected the patients' contentment with their medical interactions—and whether or not, through these interactions, they agreed with and implemented said health care regimens. Another of these situations involved the potential options in a legal arena. The way that the judges, plaintiffs, and defendants accommodated themselves to both the situation and the jury could manipulate the jury's acceptance or rejection of the defendant, and could, thus, control the outcome of the case.

Communication accommodation theory was also found to have a place in media. In regards to radio broadcasting, the alliance of the audience with the broadcaster played an important part in both the ratings that the shows would receive and whether the show progressed or was cancelled.

In the area of jobs and employment, accommodation theory was believed to influence the satisfaction one has with his or her job and the productivity that that person possesses in said job through convergence with or divergence from the co-workers and their work environment.

Accommodation theory also possessed practical applications in the development of learning a second language. This was seen when the student's education of and proficiency in said language was either assisted or hindered by accommodative measures. Giles, Coupland, and Coupland (1991) also addressed the part that accommodation theory plays in a situation they called ''language switching'', when bilingual individuals must decide which language they should speak when they are in an organizational environment with other bilingual individuals. This can be an incredibly important choice to make, especially in a business setting, because an incorrect judgment in this area of communication could unwittingly promote negative reactions between the two or more parties involved. In addition, accommodation theory was strongly intertwined with the way an immigrant accepts and is accepted by their host country. An instance of over-accommodation from the immigrating individual can unintentionally damage that person's sense of individuality while a strong divergence from the immigrating individual from their host culture can prompt the natives of the host country to react negatively to them because of the immigrating individual's use of divergence.

The final area of practical application, as presented by Giles, Coupland, and Coupland (1991), was that of accommodation theory's effect on the lives of people with disabilities. Accommodation theory was thought to either aid them by promoting them to "fulfill their communicative and life potentials", or by hindering them from reaching their full potential by focusing on the disability that made them different rather than the other characteristics that made them similar to their peers.

Despite the fact that communication accommodation theory is theoretical, it has shown itself to be viable by its numerous practical applications.{{sfn|Giles|Coupland|Coupland|1991}}

== Criticisms ==

The Communication Accommodation Theory has obtained scholarly criticism by the three scholars Judee Burgon, Leesa Dillman, and Lesa Stern. These scholars question the "convergence-divergence frame... [and] they believe that conversations are too complex to be reduced simply to the processes of the Communication Accommodation theory. They also challenge the notion that people's accommodation can be explained by just the practice of [convergence-divergence]".{{sfn|McGraw|2004}} Questions asked by the scholars were: "what occurs if people both converge and diverge in conversations, are there consequences to the speaker, the listener, is there an influence if race or ethnicity is played in the process?".{{sfn|McGraw|2004}} It causes conflicts between communicators because the theory relies too heavily on a rational way of communicating. Sometimes we as people do not have a rational way of thinking and this becomes a problem when communicating.

== Application ==

The Communication Accommodation theory focuses "on the role of conversations in our lives".{{sfn|McGraw|2004}}  It has been incorporated into "the mass media (Bell, 1991), with families (Fox, 1999), with Chinese students (Hornsey and Gallois, 1998), with elderly (Harwood, 2002), on the job (McCroskey and Richmond, 2000), in interviews (Willemyns, Gallois, Callan, and Pittam, 1997), and even with messages left on telephone answering machines (Buzzanell, Burrell, Stafford, and Berkowitz, 1996)".{{sfn|McGraw|2004}} The theory tends to be heuristic because it is "expansive enough to be complete, and has been supported by research from diverse authors". "The theory's core processes of convergence and divergence make it relatively easy to understand, underscoring the simplicity of the theory".{{sfn|McGraw|2004}}

==Intergenerational communications==

Researchers of communication accommodation theory who have been interested in conversations between the elderly and the young, actively apply this theory to analyze intergenerational communication situations. Since the aging of population is becoming a serious issue in current society, communication difficulties of older adults and issues like [[ageism]] should be addressed. According to mainstream sociolinguistic studies, age is regarded as a variable only to the extent that it may show patterns of dialectal variation within speech communities across time. However, the existence of potentially important generational differences relating to beliefs about talk, situational perceptions, interactional goals, and various language devices between the young and the elderly are all taken into account as empirical questions in their own right{{sfn|Coupland|Coupland|Giles|Henwood|1988}} when using communication accommodation theory to explore intergenerational communication problems and improve effectiveness. Previous researchers have also developed models such as the communication predicament model of ageing,{{sfn|Ryan|Giles|Bartolucci|Henwood|1986}} and the communication enhancement model of ageing,{{sfn|Ryan|Meredith|MacLean|Orange|1995}} to point out numerous consequences brought by both negative and positive attitudes towards aging.

===Young-to-elderly language strategies===

Even though young people are more likely to perceive the old by multiple stereotypes, the elderly are negatively evaluated in most situations,{{sfn|Hummert|1990}} resulting in a reduction of meaningful communication.To further illustrate this, Ryan ''et al''. devised a typology of four young-to-elderly language strategies{{sfn|Ryan|Giles|Bartolucci|Henwood|1986}} in his research concerning psycho linguistic and social psychological components of communication with the elderly, addressing a problem for the elderly that they are vulnerable to the social and psychological circumstances of isolation, neglect, and negative stereotyping. However, it is not appropriate to see problematic intergenerational talk as a one-sided affair since both the young and the old can be responsible for miscommunication and unsuitable accommodation.

The first of these is characterized as over-accommodation due to physical or sensory handicaps, which happens when speakers talk to handicapped recipients, usually those with hearing impairment, and adapt their speech beyond the optimal level. This is also known as "Elderspeak", a form of baby talk in which a person addresses the elderly in an overly simple and sometimes patronizing way.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The second strategy is labelled as dependency-related over-accommodation, which refers to overbearing, excessively directive and disciplinary speech to the elderly. "It was conjectured that this strategy is encoded as one of the means by which a younger person can control the relationship and induce the elderly individual to become dependent on the former".{{sfn|Coupland|Coupland|Giles|Henwood|1988}}

Age-related divergence is the third strategy. This tenet proposes that young speakers may seek to amplify the distinctiveness of their own social group by purposefully acting in ways that differ from their stereotype of old speakers.{{sfn|Coupland|Coupland|Giles|Henwood|1988}} Older speakers might be seen as in physical and mental decline; slowing down with age and unable to keep pace with the current social norms. These young speakers, attempting to differentiate themselves from this image, will talk faster, use fashionable colloquialism and slang, and express more "modern" ideas and values in their communication with seniors.

The fourth strategy is intergroup over-accommodation and it is considered one of the most pervasive of young-to-elderly language strategies.  The "simple perception of an addressee's social category membership being old – and, independently of a particular handicap (if any), considerations of dependency and in-group symbolization are sufficient to invoke negative physical, social, and psychological inferences for many younger people".{{sfn|Coupland|Coupland|Giles|Henwood|1988}}

===Communication between old and young people in various relationships===

Giles has studied the interaction of young and elderly persons in business settings using communication accommodation as a theoretical framework. Findings demonstrated that elderly persons tend to be less accommodating than their younger counterparts. Findings also demonstrated that, for example, in business settings, one is much more likely to accommodate and converge to the language of a superior, such as a manager, than to someone with less or equal amount of superiority, such as a co-worker.  While several other factors came into play, convergence, and divergence portions of this theory were used in interpreting and explain this phenomenon.{{sfn|McCann|Giles|2006}}

The prevalence of and consequences for ageism and ageist language in intergenerational interactions in health care contexts such as hospitals and long-term care facilities have also been discussed.{{sfn|Nussbaum|Pitts|Huber|Krieger|2005}} Factors such as negative ageist stereotypes and unique features of the older adult patient-physician interaction can result in miscommunication between physicians and patients.{{sfn|Nussbaum|Pecchioni|Crowell|2001}} Moreover, individuals are more likely to use patronizing language styles,{{sfn|Hummert|Shaner|Garstka|Henry|1998}} to evaluate patronizing communication positively, and less likely to respond assertively to ageist language in hospital settings than in community dwellings.{{sfn|Hummert|Mazloff|2001}} In the domain of mental health care for older individuals, research also suggests that the elderly are systematically disadvantaged when interacting with mental health professionals.{{sfn|Ivey|Wieling|Harris|2000}}

==Intercultural communications==

Since communication accommodation theory applies to both interpersonal and inter-group communication one of the fields in which it has been most applied has been in [[intercultural communication]]. Within this field it has been applied to explain and analyze communication behaviors in a variety of situations, such as interactions between non-native and natives during second language acquisition processes, and interactions between inter-ethnic groups.

Studies{{sfn|Dörnyei|Csizér|2005}} show the comparison of communication accommodation in foreign countries between tourists and locals. In countries with heavy tourism, many being [[Third World]], it is common that the actual tourists have little to no competency in, or desire of having competency in the language and style of communication of the local natives. On the other hand, the country's local economy as well as the livelihood of its citizens, heavily depends on these tourists. Therefore, there is a great need to accommodate the communication styles of the tourists.

==Communication between native and non-native language speakers in second language acquisition==

===Non-native language speakers===

The input that [[non-native speakers]] (NNS) obtain from their interlocutors during [[second language acquisition]] is crucial in their process of language learning.{{sfn|Zuengler|1991}}  For instance, as the similarity attraction theory predicts, non-native speakers (NNS) are more likely to converge towards the [[native speaker]]'s (NS) language when they identify him or her as similar to themselves: "When an NNS and an NS share important social identities, ethnic or not, the NNS will be more likely to converge towards the NS's language use".{{sfn|Zuengler|1991}}  In a study conducted by Young (1998) for instance, high [[Language proficiency|proficiency]] Chinese English Language Second Speakers interviewed by individuals with a higher degree of social convergence in terms of ethnicity, sex, occupation, educational level, place of origin, and age were significantly more likely to converge to their interlocutor's standard English plural conjunction than those who were interviewed by subjects that differed more in terms of these social characteristics.{{sfn|Zuengler|1991}}  Unlike previous studies that focussed mostly in ethnic solidarity to explain language variations in second language learners (Beebe and Zuengler, 1983), this later study proved that "it is not interlocutor ethnicity alone that causes linguistic variation, but a collection of attributes (of which one is ethnicity) by which interlocutors assess their relative similarity to each other... providing clear support for the similarity-attraction aspect of CAT".{{sfn|Zuengler|1991}}

On the other hand, like the inter-group distinctiveness theory argues, several studies have revealed that when second language learners feel their social identity is threatened due to patronizing behavior towards their ethnic group they are more likely to engage in divergence. In a study conducted by Zuengler (1982) amongst Spanish and Greek speakers learning English, subjects were asked both ethnically threatening and neutral questions by a native English speaker. Those subjects that answered the ethnic-threatening question in a more personal form were noted to decrease the "native English-like pronunciations of the sounds" in their answers.{{sfn|Zuengler|1991}} Similar results were obtained in a study conducted by Giles and Bourhis conducted in Wales.  In this study Welshmen with strong ties to their nation and their language who were learning Welsh were asked questions about methods of second language acquisition.  In this study the questions were asked by an English speaker with an RP-sounding accent "...who at one point arrogantly challenged their reasons for what he called "... a dying language which had a dismal future."{{sfn|Giles|St. Clair|1979}}  In response to this question, which greatly threatened their identity and intergroup distinctiveness, the informants diverged considerably by strengthening their Welsh accents and using Welsh.{{sfn|Giles|St. Clair|1979}}

===Native language speakers===

Native language speakers frequently engage in "foreign talk" (FT) when interacting with second language learners. In this type of talk native speakers adopt features such as "slower speech rates, shorter and simpler sentence, more question and question tags, greater pronunciation articulation" amongst others.{{sfn|Zuengler|1991}} This is done to increase efficiency, especially when the native speakers perceive the non-native speakers as less competent communicators,{{sfn|Zuengler|1991}} or (as the similarity-attraction theory predicts) to increase attraction.  Foreign talk often contains features that mirror the mistakes made by non-native speakers in order to make speech more similar, and hence "NS may include ungrammatical features in their FT".{{sfn|Zuengler|1991}}  As predicted by the inter-group distinctiveness theory, native speakers might also choose to refrain from engaging in FT or might use divergence, whenever they wish to maintain group distinctiveness, either because they have a lower perception of the other group, they feel threatened by them, or they wish to display [[Ethnocentrism|ethnocentricity]].{{sfn|Zuengler|1991}}

== Immigrants ==

Immigrants tend to converge according to what they perceive to be the prototypical behaviors of their new group, or according to the norms that they infer make part of their new environment.{{sfn|Gallois|Callan|1991}} Meanwhile, their new communities "also may hold norms, about how immigrants do and/or should use the majority language" and "convergence that is perceived by members of the host community as inappropriate to the speaker's status, the relationship, or the norms of the situation, may be labelled as ingratiating, condescending or gauche".{{sfn|Gallois|Callan|1991}} This might lead to a negative appraisal of the immigrant speaker. For this reasons, Gallois and Callan  (1991) suggest that it is important to teach immigrants about the norms that govern convergence in each community. Although other personal motives govern immigrant's linguistic choices later on, their expectations and the situational norms that they are able to perceive are what guide their linguistic choices when they are new to a culture.{{sfn|Gallois|Callan|1991}}

== Family communication dynamics and sexual identity ==
A research paper uses the basis of the Communication Accommodation Theory along with Intergroup Communication and relational Satisfaction to explain the perception of a family towards homosexuality and how family communication dynamics are impacted when one of the family member has a different sexual identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://web.b.ebscohost.com.proxy.library.georgetown.edu/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?vid=9&amp;sid=535c088a-c36c-43bc-bf22-479d73c3d4e3@pdc-v-sessmgr01|title=Off-campus Access Login|website=web.b.ebscohost.com.proxy.library.georgetown.edu|access-date=2017-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, the study was conducted to understand how to parent such a child and the consequences of disclosure on the communication in the family. Sexual identity can be a challenging discussion for a family and revealing one's preferred identity led to topic avoidance under intergroup anxiety and the relational satisfaction was negatively viewed. Such a constrained communication made the individuals feel that their relationship with the family member was less fulfilling and eventually less satisfying.

==New media==
As communication accommodation theory explains "the cognitions and motivations that underlie interactants' communication" with context and identity salience,{{sfn|Jones| Watson|Gardner|Gallois|2006}} it's feasible to apply it to new media related settings. Even though research in this field is still at its early stage, interesting case studies have appeared in recent years.
Studies have investigated possible accommodative tendencies of librarians when faced with cyberlanguage use by the patron through instant messaging technology. Since use of cyberlanguage in VRS (virtual reference services) conversations has been suggested as one possible way to strengthen patron relations, patrons who are satisfied with their interaction with a librarian who use cyberlanguage may be more willing to return. However, the result suggests that patron's use of cyberlanguage has no influence on a librarian's use of cyberlanguage and surprisingly convergence doesn't happen.{{sfn|Christopherson| 2011}} Nevertheless, accommodation of communication styles do happen in other [[computer-mediated communication]] circumstances. In group [[brainstorming]] conversations, Chinese participants are likely to become as responsive as Americans when working in mixed-culture groups and more talkative when using lean medium.{{sfn|Wang|Fussell|Setlock| 2009}} The use of new media provides users an opportunity to more quickly provide or gather information without new or additional disruption.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Garrett|first=R. Kelly|last2=Danziger|first2=James N.|date=October 2007|title=IM = Interruption Management? Instant Messaging and Disruption in the Workplace|url=https://academic.oup.com/jcmc|journal=Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication|volume=13|pages=23–42|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Case studies==

===Police officers===

Giles has also looked at the actions and attitudes in the public's interaction with [[police officer]]s, using accommodation theory.  Relational and identity aspects of this theory help to illustrate the interaction patterns that exist between the public and the police in the various situations in which these interaction take place.&lt;ref&gt;Giles, et al., 2005&lt;/ref&gt;  This study looked at both the accommodation patterns of the officers and the public with whom they were dealing.

In this case of policemen and accommodation, it is important for men and women of the force to find a stable balance between accommodating (displaying care, empathy, respect etc.,) and keeping a firm stance of authority. Studies show that the public believes policemen, overall, should work on being more community oriented and accommodating to all of its citizens, not only to reduce tension, anxiety, and stress, but to build trust and satisfaction between both parties. There are current, as well as up-and-coming community-based police programs to give citizens a more "informal", "down to earth", view of their commanding officers. However, even with all of these accommodations being made, it is necessary for there to remain an understanding of the higher power, so that in the case in life-threatening situations, men and women of the police force can continue to actively and effectively uphold society

===Pharmacists===

From November 2015 to April 2016, a study was conducted to observe the communication between pharmacists and patients during medication counseling sessions.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chevalier|first1=Bernadette A. M.|last2=Watson|first2=Bernadette M.|last3=Barras|first3=Michael A.|last4=Cottrell|first4=William Neil|title=Investigating strategies used by hospital pharmacists to effectively communicate with patients during medication counselling|journal=Health Expectations|date=October 2017|volume=20|issue=5|pages=1121–1132|doi=10.1111/hex.12558}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was conducted in order to understand what is occurring during these exchanges. "Twelve pharmacists engaged four patients each for a total of 48 medication counselling interactions that took place".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; During each session, the pharmacists were recorded by one of the main researchers, another pharmacist with no ties to the other pharmacists. In each recording, the main researcher (referred to as BC) specifically searched for five strategies of CAT: approximation, interpretability, discourse management, emotional expression and interpersonal control.

* "Approximation concerns how individuals adjust their speech patterns".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Speech in approximation can converge or diverge from the patient, but is appropriately applied with convergence
* "Interpretability strategies focus on each speaker's conversational competence".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This means that the speaker communicates in a way to ensure the speaker understands the content of the message.
* "Discourse management strategies involve conversation processes to promote conversation between interactants".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This involves using nonverbal or verbal cues to signal a person to speak or change the subject accordingly. 
* Emotional expression demonstrates "empathy and reassurance".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* "Interpersonal control focuses on the roles and power relations between speakers".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This strategy of CAT establishes common ground between the speakers in a form of equality.

Upon conclusion of this study, it was shown that most of the pharmacists used the five CAT strategies during their social exchanges with the patients; however, the presentations of discourse varied by pharmacist.

===''Speak Arabic please!'' A case study in communication accommodation ===

In Sonia S'hiri's ''Speak Arabic please!'': [[Tunisian Arabic|Tunisian]] Arabic Speakers' Linguistic Accommodation to Middle Easterners" she describes how speakers of Tunisian Arabic converge to the "[[Arabic language|Sharqi]]" or " Middle Eastern Arabic" of their co-workers.{{sfn|S'hiri|2002}}

One of the many ways to divide the [[Arab]] world is between the West ''[[Maghreb]]'' and the East ''Sharq''.  Though there is no official ''Sharqi Arabic'', the varieties usually associated with Sharqi Arabic are [[Egyptian Arabic|Egyptian]], [[Levantine Arabic|Levantine]], and [[Persian Gulf/Iraqi Arabic]].  Due to [[Egypt]]'s dominance of the media and arts, the "Sharqi" Arabic spoken in the region has come to be perceived by Tunisians, as "lighter", more poetic and artistic, more humorous, more romantic and even more beautiful than the local [Tunisian] variety.{{sfn|S'hiri|2002}}  Again, because of its dominance in the media and the arts, Arabic speakers throughout the Arab world are much more familiar with "Sharqi" varieties than they are with "Maghrebi" varieties.  A common yet incorrect belief about speech interactions in the Arab speaking world is that when speakers of different varieties of the language come into contact with one another, the default language for communication is [[Modern Standard Arabic]] (Fusha).

In her study conducted in London, S'hiri examined the social reasons for Tunisian Arabs to converge linguistically to speakers of "Sharqi Arabic".  The data she found also gave ample evidence to show that code-switching into pure Fusha for communication is a misconception.  S'hiri recorded five Tunisian Arabic speakers (M1, M2, W1, W2, and W3) who worked at two different broadcasting companies and found that they did indeed converge linguistically to their Sharqi co-workers.  They did not however, resort solely to Fusha.  S'hiri found that when interacting with speakers of "Sharqi" Arabic, her Tunisian informants used linguistic features and [[Word|lexical items]] characteristic of the "Sharqi" variety, some English words, (instead of the [[French language|French]] words often used in Tunisian Arabic speech) in addition to switching to Fusha.  S'hiri found that many of her informants were proud of both their Tunisian variety of Arabic as well as their ability converge linguistically and even posits the idea of "showing off" as a goal of linguistic convergence".{{sfn|S'hiri|2002}} Her findings lead to an interesting sort of paradox. Although the Tunisian Arabs abandon their own variety of the language, they do not experience a feeling of loss of identity, because the ability to code-switch, perceived as prestigious in their culture, makes part of their positive identity. Despite their inner feelings of pride for their own group, by accommodating to the Sharqi speakers the Tunisians are setting aside their ingoup identity in order to "promote their extended ethnicity as members of an Arab nation instead of just as Tunisians".{{sfn|S'hiri|2002}} In terms of accommodation theory, Tunisians in [[London]] can be seen as the "ingroup" trying to assimilate to the "outgroup".{{sfn|S'hiri|2002}}

When her informants were asked why they had switched to the "Sharqi" variety, they all agreed it was psychologically motivating, because it allowed them to get closer to their interlocutors.   M1 added that this allowed him to convey friendliness to his interlocutors, to reduce differences and avoid rejection.{{sfn|S'hiri|2002}} Informant W2 "Found that using TA [Tunisian Arabic] is an obstacle to getting closer to people.  She felt excluded especially at the beginning since Sharqis seemed to avoid her because they believed she would be difficult to understand".{{sfn|S'hiri|2002}} W2 also "Claims that the level of readiness of Sharqis to understand her determines whether she uses TA with them or not.  She wants to avoid ridicule".{{sfn|S'hiri|2002}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7413">'''Constantine Simonides''' (1820–1890), was a [[Paleography|palaeographer]] and dealer of icons, known as a man of extensive learning, with significant knowledge of manuscripts and miraculous calligraphy. He surpassed his contemporaries in literary ability.
Some paleographers say that he was the most versatile forger of the nineteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;Falconer Madan, [https://archive.org/stream/booksinmanuscrip00madaiala#page/124/mode/2up ''Books in manuscript : a short introduction to their study and use. With a Chapter on Records''], London 1898, p. 124.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
He was born on the small Greek island of [[Symi]], on the coast of the [[Aegean Sea]] in 1820 (or in 1824), and died in Egypt of leprosy.

Simonides lived in the monasteries on [[Mount Athos]] between 1839 and 1841 and again in 1852, during which time he acquired some of the biblical manuscripts that he later sold. He produced a lot of manuscripts ascribed to Hellenistic and early Byzantine periods. He allegedly forged a number of documents and manuscripts and claimed they were the originals of the [[Gospel of Mark]], as well as original manuscripts of poems of [[Homer]]. He sold some of these manuscripts to the King of Greece. Greek scholars exposed what some claimed to be forgeries quickly and he left Greece and traveled from country to country with his manuscripts.
He visited England between 1853 and 1855 and other European countries, and his literary activity was extraordinary.&lt;ref&gt;C. L. Fritzsche, [https://books.google.com/books?hl=pl&amp;id=FU9ObWZ7_1MC&amp;dq=&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=result#PPA2,M1 ''Enthüllungen über den Simonides-dindorfschen Uranios''] (Leipzig 1856), p. 2 ff.&lt;/ref&gt; Some of his works were published in [[Moscow]], [[Odessa]], in England,&lt;ref&gt;He edited in London facsimile of the ''Gospel of Mark''. Facsimile was illustrated by him, and has an inscription, stating that the documents shown within, “date to the time of Christ when he (sic) lived upon Earth among (sic) man or men&amp;nbsp;..."&lt;/ref&gt; and in Germany. He also wrote many other works which were never published.

From 1843 until 1856 all over Europe he offered for sale manuscripts purporting to be of ancient origin.
He created "a considerable sensation by producing quantities of Greek manuscripts professing to be of fabulous antiquity – such as a [[Homer]] in an almost prehistoric style of writing, a lost Egyptian historian, a copy of [[Gospel of Matthew|St. Matthew's Gospel]] on papyrus, written fifteen years after the [[Ascension of Jesus|Ascension]] (!), and other portions of the [[New Testament]] dating by him to the first century. These productions were later claimed to be forgeries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Kenyon | first = Frederick G. | authorlink = Frederic G.

In 1854 and 1855 Simonides tried unsuccessfully to sell some manuscripts for the [[British Museum]] and the [[Bodleian Library]]. [[Thomas Phillipps]] was a less critical purchaser and bought for the Phillips Library at [[Cheltenham]] some manuscripts. In 1855 he visited Berlin and Leipzig. He informed [[Wilhelm Dindorf]] that he owned a palimpsest of Uranius.&lt;ref&gt;Falconer Madan, [https://archive.org/stream/booksinmanuscrip00madaiala#page/124/mode/2up ''Books in manuscript : a short introduction to their study and use. With a Chapter on Records''], London 1898, p. 125.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 13 September 1862, in an article of ''[[The Guardian]]'', he claimed that he is the real author of the [[Codex Sinaiticus]] and that he wrote it in 1839. According to him it was "the one poor work of his youth". According to Simonides, he visited Sinai in 1852 and saw the codex. [[Henry Bradshaw (scholar)|Henry Bradshaw]], a scholar, didn't believe his claims.&lt;ref&gt;McKitterick, David (1998) ''A history of Cambridge University Press'', Volume 2: ''Scholarship and Commerce (1698-1872)'', Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, {{ISBN|0-521-30802-X}}, page 369.&lt;/ref&gt;

Simonides questioned many of official scientific positions accepted by scholars. He did not respect any scholars.
He interpreted Egyptian hieroglyphics in different ways than [[Jean-François Champollion|Champollion]] and other [[Egyptology|Egyptologists]]. He tried to prove that his method of interpreting Egyptian hieroglyphics was superior.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Janko, [https://www.scribd.com/doc/20842686/The-Artemidorus-Papyrus-sulla-Classical-Review ''The Artemidorus Papyrus''], [[Classical Association|Classical Review]] 59.2 (2009), p.&amp;nbsp;404.&lt;/ref&gt; He placed the death of [[Irenaeus]] at 292 (c. 130 – c. 200). Also, in many other complicated questions he had his own, usually controversial, point of view, but after ascribing the authorship of the Codex Sinaiticus to himself, the rest of his credibility was destroyed by the British press. {{citation needed|date=December 2018}}

==The Artemidorus Papyrus==
In 2006 a papyrus book-roll was exhibited at Turin which appeared to be part of Book II of the lost ''Geographical Descriptions'' of [[Artemidorus Ephesius]]. It was exhibited again in Berlin in 2008. It has been argued by [[Luciano Canfora]] that the manuscript is the work of Constantine Simonides.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Parsons, ''Forging Ahead: Has Simonides Struck Again?'', TLS 22 February 2008, p 14.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Richard Janko]] also believes that the roll is a forgery.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Janko, [https://www.scribd.com/doc/20842686/The-Artemidorus-Papyrus-sulla-Classical-Review ''The Artemidorus Papyrus''], [[Classical Association|Classical Review]] 59.2 (2009), pp.&amp;nbsp;403–410.&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''crime family''' is a unit of an [[organized crime]] syndicate, particularly [[the Mafia]] (both in [[Sicily]] and [[American Mafia|in the United States]]), often operating within a specific geographic territory. In its strictest sense, a ''family'' (or ''clan'') is a criminal gang, operating either on a unitary basis or as an organized collection of smaller gangs (e.g., ''cells'', ''factions'', ''crews'', etc.).  In turn, a family can be a sole "enterprise", or part of a larger [[syndicate]] or [[cartel]].

==Origins==
The origins of the term come from the [[Sicilian Mafia]].  In the [[Sicilian language]], the word ''[[cosca]]'', which literally translates into ''[[artichoke]]'' (a vegetable whose multiple layers surround and protect a vital core), is also used for ''[[clan]]''.  In the early days of [[the Mafia]], loose groups of bandits organized themselves into associations that over time became more organized, and they adopted the term based on both of its meanings.

As the Mafia was imported into the [[United States]] in the late 19th century, the [[English language|English]] translation of the word ''cosca'' was more at ''clan'' or ''family''.

The term can be a point of confusion, especially in [[popular culture]] and [[Hollywood]], because in the truest sense, crime families are not necessarily blood [[families]] who happen to be involved in criminal activity, and not necessarily based on blood relationships. In Sicily and America, most Mafia bosses are not related to their predecessors.&lt;ref&gt;Diego Gambetta. The Sicilian Mafia: The Business of Private Protection. 1993&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Everything Mafia Book: True-life Accounts of Legendary Figures, Infamous Crime Families, and Nefarious Deeds. Scott M. Dietche. Everything Books, 2009. Page 80&lt;/ref&gt; Films like ''[[The Godfather]]'' and a spate of late-1980s "Mafia princess" television movies underscore this confusion.

It can further be speculated that the Mafia was simply emulating, to a certain degree, a more medieval order in which a [[Italian nobility|noble family]] would more or less serve as the power in a local village, in a sort of inverted [[hacienda]] culture.

The [[Calabria]]n ''[['Ndrangheta]]'' is, however, purported to be organized along familial lines.

Nevertheless, the term stuck, both in the minds of popular culture as well as the national law enforcement community, and eventually began to be used to describe individual units of not only Sicilian gangsters, but those whose origins lie in other parts of Italy (e.g., the aforementioned '''Ndrangheta'', the Neapolitan ''[[Camorra]]'', the Apulian ''[[Sacra Corona Unita]]'', etc.).  Indeed, the "family" mystique is to such a great degree that in the late 1990s, after many [[Camorra]] leaders were imprisoned during a large-scale crackdown in [[Naples]], many of their wives, girlfriends, daughters, and even mothers took temporary control of their gangs, in a widespread phenomenon of Camorra "godmothers".

Sometimes the term is used to describe distinct units of crime syndicates of other ethnic and national origin, such as the [[Irish Mob]], Japanese ''[[Yakuza]]'', Chinese ''[[Tong (organization)|Tongs]]'' and ''[[Triad society|Triads]]'', ''[[Indian Mafia]]'', Colombian and Mexican ''[[drug cartels]]'', [[Chechen mafia]], [[Russian mafia]], [[Maltese mafia]] , the ''[[Thief in law]]'' and [[Eastern European]] families. Some of these entities, like the 'Ndrangheta, may also be organized along blood-family lines.

'''Cypriot Turkish''' ({{lang-tr|Kıbrıs Türkçesi}}) is a dialect of the [[Turkish language]] spoken by [[Turkish Cypriots]] both in [[Cyprus]] and among [[Turkish Cypriot diaspora|its diaspora]].

==History==
Emanating from [[Anatolia]] and evolved for four centuries, Cypriot Turkish is the [[vernacular]] spoken by Cypriots with [[Ottoman Turks|Ottoman]] ancestry, as well as by Cypriots who converted to [[Islam]] during Ottoman rule.&lt;ref&gt; Jennings, Ronald (1993), Christians and Muslims in Ottoman Cyprus and the Mediterranean World, 1571-1640, New York University Press {{ISBN|0-814-74181-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It is understood by expatriate Cypriots living in the UK, United States, Australia and other parts of the world.

Cypriot Turkish consists of a blend of [[Ottoman Turkish language|Ottoman Turkish]] and the [[Yörük]] dialect that is spoken in the [[Taurus Mountains]] of southern [[Turkey]]. In addition, it has absorbed influences from [[Greek language|Greek]], [[Italian language|Italian]] and [[English language|English]].

Cypriot Turkish is mutually intelligible with [[Turkish language|Standard Turkish]].

==Sounds==

===Differences between standard Turkish and Cypriot Turkish===
Cypriot Turkish is distinguished by a number of sound alternations not found in standard Turkish, but some of which are also quite common in other Turkish vernaculars:
* Voicing of some unvoiced [[stop consonant|stops]]
** t↔d, k↔g
::Standard Turkish {{lang|tr|taş}} ↔ Cypriot Turkish {{lang|tr-CY|daş}} "stone"
::Standard Turkish {{lang|tr|kurt}} ↔ Cypriot Turkish {{lang|tr-CY|gurt}} "wolf"
::Standard Turkish {{lang|tr|Kıbrıs}} ↔ Cypriot Turkish {{lang|tr-CY|Gıprıs}} "[[Cyprus]]"
* Preservation of earlier [[Turkic languages|Turkic]] {{lang|trk|*ŋ}}
::Standard Turkish {{lang|tr|son}} ↔ Cypriot Turkish {{lang|tr-CY|soŋ}} "end, last"
::Standard Turkish {{lang|tr|bin}} ↔ Cypriot Turkish {{lang|tr-CY|biŋ}} "thousand"
* Changing 1st person plural suffix
** z↔k
::Standard Turkish {{lang|tr|isteriz}} ↔ Cypriot Turkish {{lang|tr-CY|isterik}} "we want"
* Unvoicing of some voiced stops
** b↔p
::Standard Turkish: {{lang|tr|Arabaya binmek}} ↔ Cypriot Turkish: {{lang|tr-CY|Arabaya pinmek}} "Get in the car"{{cn |date=April 2018}}
* [[Lenition]] of final [[affricate]]s
** ç ({{IPA|[tʃ]}}) ↔ ş ({{IPA|[ʃ]}})
::Standard Turkish {{lang|tr|hiç}} ↔ Cypriot Turkish {{lang|tr-CY|hiş}} "no, none"

The last two alternations are more specific to Cypriot Turkish and are seen less often in other Turkish vernaculars.

==Grammar==
Cypriot Turkish is structured as a [[VO language]] as opposed to standard Turkish which is an [[OV language]]. It is very typical in forming a question.
* Standard Turkish {{lang|tr|Okula gidecek misin?}} is, in Cypriot Turkish, {{lang|tr-CY|Gideceŋ okula?}} ("Will you go to school?")

Cypriot Turkish uses the [[aorist]] tense instead of the present continuous tense, and very often in place of the future tense as well.
* Standard Turkish {{lang|tr|Okula gidiyorum}} or {{lang|tr|Okula gideceğim}} ("I am going to school") are, in Cypriot Turkish, {{lang|tr-CY|Giderim okula}} ("I go to school" / "I am going to school" / "I will go to school")

Cypriot Turkish does not use the narrative/indefinite past, and only uses the simple past instead.
* Standard Turkish {{lang|tr|Eve gitmiş}} ("He is reported to have gone home") is, in Cypriot Turkish, not used. Instead {{lang|tr-CY|Eve gitti}} or {{lang|tr-CY|Gitti eve}} ("He went home") suffices.

Cypriot Turkish also lacks the question suffix of {{lang|tr|mi}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite paper |last=Demir |first=Nurettin |url=http://turkoloji.cu.edu.tr/DILBILIM/nurettin_demir_kibris.pdf |title=Kıbrıs Ağızları Üzerine Notlar |language=Turkish |publisher=Çukurova University |journal=Journal of Turcology |accessdate=14 June 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is similar to colloquial Azerbaijani.
* Standard Turkish {{lang|tr|Annen evde midir?}} ("Is your mother at home?") is, in Cypriot Turkish, {{lang|tr-CY|Anneŋ evdedir?}}

In Cypriot Turkish, the [[reflexive pronoun]] in third person is different, namely {{lang|tr-CY|geŋni}} ("him, himself, them, themself"). In Standard Turkish, this would be {{lang|tr|kendisini}}.

==Semantics==
{{Expand section|date=January 2017}}
Typical question usually do not qualify as standard Turkish questions (see the example above) because question suffixes are usually dropped by native Turkish Cypriots. Another subtle difference is the emphasis on verbs.

"Dragon-kings: mechanisms, statistical methods and empirical evidence." The European Physical Journal Special Topics 205.1 (2012): 1-26.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
[[Dragon king]] (DK) is a double metaphor for an event that is both extremely large in size or impact (a "king") and born of unique origins (a "dragon") relative to its peers (other events from the same system). DK events are generated by / correspond to mechanisms such as [[positive feedback]], [[Tipping point (sociology)|tipping points]], [[bifurcation theory|bifurcations]], and [[phase transitions]], that tend to occur in [[nonlinear]] and [[complex systems]], and serve to [[amplifier|amplify]] DK events to extreme levels. By understanding and monitoring these dynamics, some predictability of such events may be obtained.&lt;ref name="SorOui2012"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sor2009"&gt;D. Sornette, Dragon-Kings, Black Swans and the Prediction of Crises, International Journal of Terraspace Science and Engineering 1(3), 1-17 (2009) (https://arxiv.org/abs/0907.4290) and (http://ssrn.com/abstract=1470006)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sor2002Pred"&gt;D. Sornette, Predictability of catastrophic events: material rupture, earthquakes, turbulence, financial
 crashes and human birth, Prof. Nat. Acad. Sci. USA 99, SUPP1 (2002) 2522-2529&lt;/ref&gt;

The theory has been developed by [[Didier Sornette]], who hypothesizes that many of the crises that we face are in fact DK rather than [[black swan theory|black swans]]—i.e., they may be predictable to some degree. Given the importance of crises to the long-term organization of a variety of systems, the DK theory urges that special attention be given to the study and monitoring of extremes, and that a dynamic view be taken. From a scientific viewpoint, such extremes are interesting because they may reveal underlying, often hidden, organizing principles. Practically speaking, one should ambitiously study extreme risks, but not forget that significant uncertainty will almost always be present, and should be rigorously considered in decisions regarding risk management and design.

The theory of DK is related to concepts such as [[black swan theory]], [[outliers]], [[complex systems]], [[nonlinear dynamics]], [[power laws]], [[extreme value theory]], [[prediction]], [[extreme risks]], and [[risk management]].

==Black swans and dragon kings==
A [[black swan theory|black swan]] can be considered a metaphor for an event that is surprising (to the observer), has a major effect, and, after being observed, is rationalized in hindsight.  The theory of black swans is [[epistemology|epistemological]], relating to the limited knowledge and understanding of the observer. The term was introduced and popularized by [[Nassim Taleb]] and has been associated with concepts such as [[heavy-tailed distribution|heavy tails]], non-linear payoffs, model error, and even [[Knightian uncertainty]], whose “unknowable unknown” event terminology was popularized by former United States Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld. Taleb claims that black swan events are not predictable, and in practice, the theory encourages one to “prepare rather than predict”, and limit one's exposure to extreme fluctuations.

The black swan concept is important and poses a valid criticism of people, firms, and societies that are irresponsible in the sense that they are overly confident in their ability to anticipate and manage risk. However, claiming that extreme events are – in general – unpredictable may also lead to a lack of accountability in risk management roles. In fact, it is known that in a wide range of physical systems that extreme events are predictable to some degree.&lt;ref&gt;Didier Sornette TED Talk: https://www.ted.com/talks/didier_sornette_how_we_can_predict_the_next_financial_crisis?language=en&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Albeverio, Sergio, Volker Jentsch, and Holger Kantz. Extreme events in nature and society. Springer Science &amp; Business Media, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sor2009" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Sor2002Pred" /&gt; One simply needs to have a sufficiently deep understanding of the structure and dynamics of the focal system, and the ability to monitor it. This is the domain of the dragon kings. Such events have been referred to as Grey Swans by Taleb. A more rigorous distinction between black swans, grey swans, and dragon kings is difficult as black swans are not precisely defined in physical and mathematical terms. However technical elaboration of concepts in [[The Black Swan (Taleb book)|the Black Swan book]] are elaborated in the [https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B8nhAlfIk3QIR1o1dnk5ZmRaaGs/view Silent Risk] document. An analysis of the precise definition of a black swan in a risk management context was written by Prof. Terje Aven.&lt;ref&gt;Aven, Terje. "On the meaning of a black swan in a risk context." Safety science 57 (2013): 44-51.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dragon kings live beyond power laws==

[[File:DrawdownCCDF.png||170px|thumbnail|The 5000 largest drawdowns for 8 different futures contracts plotted according to their empirical [[CCDF]], shifted by factors of 10 for visibility. The dashed lines are power law fits.&lt;ref name="WheatSor2015Outlier"/&gt;]]

It is well known that many phenomena in both the natural and social sciences have [[power law]] statistics ([[Pareto distribution]])  
&lt;ref&gt;Mitzenmacher, Michael. "A brief history of generative models for power law and lognormal distributions." Internet mathematics 1.2 (2004): 226-251.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;Newman, Mark EJ. "Power laws, Pareto distributions and Zipf's law." Contemporary physics 46.5 (2005): 323-351.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;Sornette, Didier. "Critical Phenomena in Natural Sciences: Chaos, Fractals, Selforganization and Disorder: Concepts and Tools (Springer Series in Synergetics)." (2006).&lt;/ref&gt;
. Furthermore, from [[extreme value theory]], it is known that a broad range of distributions (the Frechet class) have tails that are asymptotically power law. The result of this is that, when dealing with crises and extremes, power law tails are the “normal” case. The unique property of power laws is that they are [[Scale invariance|scale-invariant]] / [[self-similar]] / [[fractal]]. This property implies that all events – both large and small – are generated by the same mechanism, and thus there will be no distinct precursors by which the largest events may be predicted. A well known conceptual framework for events of this type is [[self-organized criticality]]. Such concepts are compatible with the theory of the black swan. However Taleb has also stated that considering the power law as a model instead of a model with lighter tails (e.g., a [[Gaussian]])  “converts black swans into gray ones”, in the sense that the power law model gives non-negligible probability to large events.

In a variety of studies it has been found that, despite the fact that a power law models the tail of the empirical distribution well, the largest events are significantly outlying (i.e., much larger than what would be expected under the model)&lt;ref name="WheatSor2015Outlier"&gt;Wheatley, Spencer, and Didier Sornette. "Multiple Outlier Detection in Samples with Exponential &amp; Pareto Tails: Redeeming the Inward Approach &amp; Detecting Dragon Kings." arXiv preprint arXiv:1507.08689 (2015).&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;Pisarenko, V. F., and D. Sornette. "Robust statistical tests of Dragon-Kings beyond power law distributions." The European Physical Journal Special Topics 205.1 (2012): 95-115.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name="JoSor2010"/&gt;
. Such events are interpreted as dragon kings as they indicate a departure from the generic process underlying the power law. Examples of this include the largest radiation release events occurring in nuclear power plant accidents, the largest city (agglomeration) within the sample of cities in a country, the largest crashes in financial markets, and intraday wholesale electricity prices.&lt;ref name="WheatSor2015Outlier"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Black swans or dragon-kings?

==Mechanisms for Dragon Kings==

[[File:Fold Bifurcation Catastrophe.png|thumbnail|Fold bifurcation in ecology&lt;ref name="Barno"&gt;Barnosky, Anthony D., et al. "Approaching a state shift in Earth's biosphere."Nature 486.7401 (2012): 52-58.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Physically speaking, dragon kings may be associated with the regime changes, [[bifurcation theory|bifurcations]], and [[Tipping point (sociology)|tipping points]] of complex out-of-equilibrium systems.&lt;ref name="SorOui2012"/&gt; For instance, the [[Disaster|catastrophe]] ([[fold bifurcation]]) of the global ecology illustrated in the figure could be considered to be a dragon king: Many observers would be surprised by such a dramatic change of state. However, it is well known that in dynamic systems, there are many precursors as the system approaches the catastrophe.

[[Positive feedback]] is also a mechanism that can spawn dragon kings. For instance, in a [[stampede]] the number of cattle running increases the level of panic which causes more cattle to run, and so on. In human dynamics such herding and mob behavior has also been observed in crowds, stock markets, and so on (see [[herd behavior]]). 
  
[[File:SornetteBubblingAttractor.png|thumbnail|Left: Illustration of the system trajectory in the vicinity of a bubbling event. Right: empirical pdf (histogram) of peak heights in trajectories in double logarithmic scale&lt;ref name="CavSor2013"&gt;Cavalcante, Hugo LD de S., et al. "Predictability and suppression of extreme events in a chaotic system." Physical review letters 111.19 (2013): 198701.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Dragon kings are also caused by attractor bubbling in [[coupled oscillator]] systems.&lt;ref name="CavSor2013"/&gt; Attractor bubbling is a generic behavior appearing in networks of coupled oscillators where the system typically orbits in an invariant manifold with a chaotic attractor (where the peak trajectories are low), but is intermittently pushed (by noise) into a region where orbits are locally repelled from the invariant manifold (where the peak trajectories are large).  These excursions form the dragon kings, as illustrated in the figure. It is claimed that such models can describe many real phenomena such as earthquakes, brain activity, etc.&lt;ref name="CavSor2013"/&gt;  A block and spring mechanical model, considered as a model of geological faults and their earthquake dynamics, produced a similar distribution.&lt;ref name="Shaw1992"&gt;Shaw, Bruce E., Jean M. Carlson, and James S. Langer. "Patterns of seismic activity preceding large earthquakes." Journal of Geophysical Research: Solid Earth (1978–2012) 97.B1 (1992): 479-488.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:FREDBalanceSheet.png|thumbnail|Expansion of FED balance sheet from https://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/]] --&gt;

It could also be the case that dragon kings are created as a result of system control or intervention. That is, trying to suppress the release of stress or death in dynamic complex systems may lead to an accumulation of stress or a maturation towards instability. For instance, [[brush]]/[[forest fires]] are a natural occurrence in many areas. Such fires are inconvenient and thus we may wish that they are diligently extinguished. This leads to long periods without inconvenient fires, however, in the absence of fires, dead wood accumulates. Once this accumulation reaches a critical point, and a fire starts, the fire becomes so large that it cannot be controlled – a singular event that could be considered to be a dragon king.  Other policies, such as doing nothing (allowing for small fires to occur naturally), or performing strategic [[controlled burning]], would avoid enormous fires by allowing for frequent small ones. Another example is [[monetary policy]]. [[Quantitative easing]] programs and [[Zero interest-rate policy|low interest rate]] policies are common, with the intention of avoiding recessions, promoting growth, etc. However, such programs build instability by increasing income inequality, keeping weak firms alive, and inflating asset bubbles.&lt;ref name="SorCau2014Perpetual"&gt;Sornette, Didier, and Peter Cauwels. "1980–2008: The illusion of the perpetual money machine and what it bodes for the future." Risks 2.2 (2014): 103-131.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SorCau2015Creep"&gt;Sornette, Didier, and Peter Cauwels. "Managing risk in a creepy world." Journal of Risk Management in Financial Institutions 8.1 (2015): 83-108.&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately such policies, aimed at smoothing out economic fluctuations, will enable an enormous correction – a dragon king.

==Detecting DK as statistical outliers==

[[File:DK Regime with Densities.png|160px|thumbnail|Probability density function schematic where the dragon king regime is represented by a lump of mass deep in the tail.]]

DK are [[outliers]] by definition. However, when calling DK outliers there is an important proviso: In standard statistics outliers are typically erroneous values and are discarded, or statistical methods are chosen that are somehow insensitive to outliers. Contrarily, DK are outliers that are highly informative, and should be the focus of much statistical attention. Thus a first step is identifying DK in historical data. Existing tests are either based on the asymptotic properties of the [[empirical distribution function]] (EDF)&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; or on an assumption about the underlying [[cumulative distribution function]] (CDF) of the data.&lt;ref name="WheatSor2015Outlier" /&gt;

It turns out that testing for outliers relative to an [[exponential distribution]] is very general. The latter follows from the [[Pickands–Balkema–de Haan theorem]] of [[Extreme value theory]] which states that a wide range of distributions asymptotically (above high thresholds) have exponential or power law tails. As an aside, this is one explanation why power law tails are so common when studying extremes. To finish the point, since the natural logarithm of a power law tail is exponential, one can take the logarithm of power law data and then test for outliers relative to an exponential tail. There are many test statistics and techniques for testing for outliers in an exponential sample.  An inward test sequentially tests the largest point, then the second largest, and so on, until the first test that is not rejected (i.e., the null hypothesis that the point is not an outlier is not rejected). The number of rejected tests identifies the number of outliers. For instance, where &lt;math&gt;x_{(1)}&gt;x_{(2)}&gt;\dots&gt;x_{(n)}&lt;/math&gt; is the sorted sample, the inward robust test uses the test statistic &lt;math&gt;T_{r,m}=x_{(r)}/(x_{(m)}+...+x_{(n)})&lt;/math&gt;  where r is the point being tested &lt;math&gt;(r=1,2,3...)&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;r&lt;m&lt;n&lt;/math&gt; where m is the pre-specified maximum number of outliers.  At each step the [[p-value]] for the [[test statistic]] must be computed and, if lower than some level, the test rejected. This test has many desirable properties: It does not require that the number of outliers be specified, it is not prone to under (masking) and over (swamping) estimation of the number outliers, it is easy to implement, and the test is independent of the value of the parameter of the exponential tail.&lt;ref name="WheatSor2015Outlier" /&gt;

(I) financial crashes as measured by [[drawdown (economics)|drawdown]]s, where the outliers correspond to terrorist attacks (e.g., the [[2005 London bombing]]), and the [[Flash crash|Flash crash of 2010]];

(II) the radiation released and loss ($) caused by accidents at nuclear power plants, where outliers correspond to runaway disasters where safety mechanisms were overwhelmed;

(III) the largest city (measured by the population in its agglomeration) in the population of cities within a country, where the largest city plays a disproportionately important role in the dynamics of the country, and benefits from unique growth; and,

(IV) intraday wholesale electricity prices.

Recent Progresses in Statistical Mechanics and Quantum Field Theory (World Scientific, Singapore, 1995) (1994): 313-332.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
How one models and predicts dragon kings depends on the underlying mechanism. However, the common approach will require continuous monitoring of the focal system and comparing measurements with a ([[non-linear]] or [[complex system|complex]]) dynamic model.  It has been proposed that the more homogeneous the system, and the stronger its interactions, the more predictable it will be.&lt;ref name="SorMilt1994"/&gt;

For instance, in non-linear systems with phase transitions at a critical point, it is well known that a window of predictability occurs in the neighborhood of the critical point due to precursory signs: the system recovers more slowly from perturbations, autocorrelation changes, variance increases, spatial coherence increases, etc.&lt;ref name="Stro"&gt;Strogatz, Steven H.

For the phenomena of unsustainable growth (e.g., of populations or stock prices), one can consider a growth model that features a finite time singularity, which is a critical point where the growth regime changes. In systems that are discrete scale invariant such a model is power law growth, decorated with a log-periodic function.&lt;ref name="Sor1998DSI"&gt;Sornette, Didier.

Physical Review E, 55(6), 6433.&lt;/ref&gt; Fitting this model on the growth data ([[non-linear regression]]) allows for the prediction of the singularity, i.e., the end of unsustainable growth.

An interesting dynamic to consider, that may reveal the development of a block-buster success, is [[Epidemic|Epidemic phenomena]]: e.g., the spread of plague, [[Viral phenomenon|viral phenomena]] in media, the spread of panic and volatility in stock markets, etc. In such a case, a powerful approach is to decompose activity/fluctuations into [[exogeneous]] and [[endogeneous]] parts, and learn about the endogenous dynamics that may lead to high impact bursts in activity.&lt;ref name="CraneSor2008"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sor2006EndoExo"&gt;Sornette, Didier.

===Prediction and decision-making===

Given a model and data, one can obtain a statistical model estimate. This model estimate can then be used to compute interesting quantities such as the conditional probability of the occurrence of a dragon king event in a future time interval, and the most probable occurrence time. When doing statistical modeling of extremes, and using complex or nonlinear dynamic models, there is bound to be substantial uncertainty.  Thus, one should be diligent in uncertainty quantification: not only considering the randomness present in the fitted stochastic model, but also the uncertainty of its estimated parameters (e.g., with [[Bayesian probability|Bayesian]] techniques or by first simulating parameters and then simulating from the model with those parameters), and the uncertainty in model selection (e.g., by considering an ensemble of different models).

One can then use the estimated probabilities and their associated uncertainties to inform decisions. In the simplest case, one performs a [[binary classification]]: predicting that a dragon king will occur in a future interval if its probability of occurrence is high enough, with sufficient certainty. For instance, one may take a specific action if a dragon king is predicted to occur. An optimal decision will then balance the cost of [[false negatives]]/[[false positives]] and [[misses]]/[[false alarms]] according to a specified [[loss function]]. For instance, if the cost of a miss is very large relative to the cost of a false alarm, the optimal decision will detect dragon kings more frequently than they occur. One should also study the [[true positive]] rate of the prediction. The smaller this value is, the weaker the test, and the closer one is to black swan territory. In practice the selection of the optimal decision, and the computation of its properties must be done by [[Cross-validation (statistics)|cross validation]] with historical data (if available), or on simulated data (if one knows how to simulate the dragon kings).

In a dynamic setting the dataset will grow over time, and the model estimate, and its estimated probabilities will evolve. One may then consider combining the sequence of estimates/probabilities when performing prediction. In this dynamic setting, the test will likely be weak most of the time (e.g., when the system is around equilibrium), but as one approaches a dragon king, and precursors become visible, the true positive rate should increase.

==The importance of extreme risks==

Dragon kings form special kinds of events leading to extreme risks (which can also be opportunities). That extreme risks are important should be self-evident. [[Natural disasters]] provide many examples (e.g., asteroid impacts leading to extinction). Some statistical examples of the impact of extremes are that: the largest nuclear power plant accident ([[Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster|2011 Fukushima disaster]]) caused more damage than all (&gt;200) other historical accidents together,&lt;ref name="WheatSorNuclear"&gt;Wheatley, Spencer, Benjamin Sovacool, and Didier Sornette. "Of Disasters and Dragon Kings: A Statistical Analysis of Nuclear Power Incidents &amp; Accidents." arXiv preprint arXiv:1504.02380 (2015).&lt;/ref&gt; the largest 10 percent of private data breaches from organizations accounts for 99 percent of the total breached private information,&lt;ref name="WheatSorCyber"&gt;Wheatley, Spencer, Thomas Maillart, and Didier Sornette. "The Extreme Risk of Personal Data Breaches &amp; The Erosion of Privacy." arXiv preprint arXiv:1505.07684 (2015).&lt;/ref&gt; the largest 5 [[epidemics]] since 1900 caused 20 times the fatalities of the remaining 1363,&lt;ref name="WheatSor2015Outlier"/&gt;&lt;ref name="EMDAT"&gt;Guha-Sapir, D., R. Below, and Ph Hoyois. "EM-DAT: International disaster database." Univ. Cathol. Louvain, Brussels: Belgium. www. em-dat. net. (2014).&lt;/ref&gt; etc. In general such statistics arrive in the presence of [[Heavy-tailed distribution|heavy tailed distributions]], and the presence of dragon kings will augment the already oversized impact of extreme events.

Despite the importance of extreme events, due to ignorance, misaligned incentives, and cognitive biases, we often fail to adequately anticipate them.  Technically speaking, this leads to poorly specified models where distributions that are not heavy tailed enough, and under-appreciating both serial and multivariate dependence of extreme events.  Some examples of such failures in risk assessment include the use of Gaussian models in finance ([[Black-Scholes]], [https://www.wired.com/2009/02/wp-quant/ the Gaussian copula], [[LTCM]]), the use of Gaussian processes and linear wave theory failing to predict the occurrence of [[rogue waves]], the failure of economic models in general to predict the [[2007 financial crisis]], and the under-appreciation of external events, cascades, and nonlinear effects in [[probabilistic risk assessment]], leading to not anticipating the [[Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster|2011 Fukushima disaster]]. Such high impact failures emphasize the importance of the study of extremes.

==Risk management==

The dragon king concept raises many questions about how one can deal with risk. Of course, if possible, one should avoid exposure to large risks (often referred to as the black swan approach). However, in many developments, exposure to risk is a necessity, and a trade-off between risk and return needs to be navigated. This nontrivial case is the one that must be considered.

In an adaptive system, where prediction of dragon kings is successful, one can act to defend the system or even profit. How to design such [[resilience (organizational)|resilient systems]], as well as their real time risk monitoring systems&lt;ref name="SorKov2013"&gt;Sornette, Didier, and Tatyana Kovalenko. "Dynamical Diagnosis and Solutions for Resilient Natural and Social Systems." Planet@ Risk 1 (1) (2013) 7-33.&lt;/ref&gt;
, is an important and interdisciplinary problem where dragon kings must be considered.

On another note, when it comes to the quantification of risk in a given system (whether it be a bank, an insurance company, a dike, a bridge, or a socio-economic system), risk needs to be accounted for over a period, such as annually. Typically one is interested in statistics such as the annual probability of loss or damage in excess of some value ([[Value at risk]]), other tail [[risk measures]], and [[return period]]s. To provide such risk characterizations, the dynamic dragon kings must be reasoned about in terms of annual frequency and severity statistics. These frequency and severity statistics can then be brought together in a model such as a [[Compound Poisson process|Compound Poisson Process]].

Provided that the statistical properties of the system are consistent over time ([[wikt:Special:Search/stationary|stationary]]), frequency and severity statistics may be constructed based on past observations, simulations, and/or assumptions. If not, one may only construct scenarios.  However, in any case, given the uncertainty present, a range of scenarios should be considered. Due to the shortage of data for extreme events, the principle of [[Occam's razor|parsimony]], and theoretical results from [[extreme value theory]] about universal tail models, one typically relies on a [[Generalized Pareto distribution|GPD]] tail model. However such a model excludes DK. Thus, when one has sufficient reason to believe that DK are present, or if one simply wants to consider a scenario, one may e.g., consider a [[Mixture distribution|density mixture]] of a [[Generalized Pareto distribution|GPD]] and a density for the DK regime.

'''Déjà Vu''' is a [[computer-assisted translation]] tool with its own program interface. It facilitates [[database]]-supported translation.

Development and marketing of this translation environment tool (TEnT) is handled by Atril, which has its international headquarters in [[Paris]], [[France]].

The latest major release of the software is Déjà Vu X3, released in July 2015, with [https://atril.com/download-and-install/ Déjà Vu X3 9.0.744] being the most recent point release, released in March 2017. Development of the next version, DVX4, is under way {{as of|2018|05|lc=y}}.

==History==
The first version of Déjà Vu was published in 1993 and used the Microsoft Word interface. In 1996, this approach was abandoned, and the software was given its own program interface.

In 2004, the founder Emilio Benito died&lt;ref&gt;[http://xa.yimg.com/kq/groups/1235603/1004716404/name/Emilio_Obituary.pdf A fond goodbye to the king of CAT] and [http://www.uebersetzerportal.de/nachrichten/n-archiv/2004/2004-02/2004-02-12.htm Déjà-Vu-Entwickler Emilio Benito gestorben]&lt;/ref&gt; and his son, Daniel Benito, Head of R&amp;D and Déjà Vu co-creator, continued running the company. Beginning in March 2009, PowerLing became the exclusive distributor for Déjà Vu in Germany, Austria and Switzerland. They began operating in France, the Netherlands, Belgium and Luxembourg in April, and in the United Kingdom, Ireland and the US and Canada in July. In January 2011, Powerling increased ATRIL's capital by taking out a controlling stake.

Déjà Vu has been one of the leading CAT [[Computer-assisted translation|(Computer Assisted Translation)]] tools for many years along with [[SDL Trados]], [[Wordfast]] and others.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2056">'''Film cement''' is a special glue designed to join [[film|motion picture]] film. It is made of [[film base]] dissolved in a [[solvent]]. Two cut sections of film are spliced together in a [[film splicer]] using film cement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.city-net.com/~fodder/edit/art1.html City Net, The Art for Film Splicing]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nfsa.gov.au/preservation/glossary/cement-film The National Film and Sound Archive of Australia, film cement]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nfsa.gov.au/preservation/glossary/splicers The National Film and Sound Archive of Australia, film splicers, cement and tape]&lt;/ref&gt;
Splices can be made either with a "hot" splicer, or the splicer unplugged and at [[room temperature]]. It is most important that the [[emulsion]] of the film be scraped off prior to applying the cement or the splice will fail. Film cement also has a workable life span, if the amount of solvent falls below a certain level the splices will fail. Cement life can be extended by the careful addition of its solvent, usually [[Butanone|methyl ethyl ketone (MEK)]] or [[acetone]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.city-net.com/~fodder/edit/art2.html City Net, DEMONSTRATION SPLICER page]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nfsa.gov.au/preservation/glossary/emulsion The National Film and Sound Archive of Australia, emulsion]&lt;/ref&gt;

Film cement can only be used with [[acetate]], [[triacetate]] and [[nitrate]] films. Film cement cannot be used with [[polyester]] based film.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.roxytheatre.net/images/booth%26basement/projdetail.jpg Roxy Theater, projector for release print]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.city-net.com/~fodder/edit/art3.html  City Net, Making consistently good, clean splices]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2796">{{more footnotes|date=September 2015}}'''Heterogram''' ([[classical compound]]: "[[wikt:hetero-#English|different]]" + "[[wikt:-gram#English|written]]") is a term used mostly in the [[philology|study of ancient texts]] for a special kind of a [[logogram]] consisting of the embedded written representation of a word in a foreign language, which does not have a spoken counterpart in the main (matrix) language of the text. In most cases, the matrix and embedded languages share the same script. While from the perspective of the embedded language the word may be written either phonetically (representing the sounds of the embedded language) or logographically, it is never a phonetic spelling from the point of view of the matrix language of the text, since there is no relationship between the symbols used and the underlying pronunciation of the word in the matrix language.

In English, the written abbreviations ''[[wikt:e.g.|e.g.]]'', ''[[wikt:i.e.|i.e.]]'', and ''[[wikt:viz.|viz.]]'' are often read respectively as "for example", "that is", and "namely".  When read this way, the abbreviations for the [[Latin]] words ''exempli gratia'', ''id est'', and ''videlicet'' are being used logographically to indicate unrelated English phrases.  Similarly, the [[ampersand]] ⟨&amp;⟩, originally a [[typographic ligature|ligature]] for the Latin word ''[[wikt:et#Latin|et]]'', in many European languages stands logographically for the local word for "and" regardless of pronunciation.  This can be contrasted with the older way of abbreviating ''[[et cetera]]''—''[[wikt:&amp;c.|&amp;c.]]''—where ⟨&amp;⟩ is used to represent ''et'' as a full [[loanword]], not a heterogram.

Heterograms are frequent in [[cuneiform script]]s, such as the [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] cuneiform, which uses [[Cuneiform script|Sumerian]] heterograms, or the Anatolian cuneiform, which uses both [[Cuneiform script|Sumerian]] and [[Cuneiform script|Akkadian]] heterograms.&lt;ref&gt;Kudrinski M. and I. Yakubovich. 2016. Sumerograms and Akkadograms in Hittite: Ideograms, Logograms, Allograms, or
Heterograms? ''Altorientalische Forschungen'' 43(1-2): 53-66.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Middle Iranian languages|Middle Iranian]] scripts derived from the [[Aramaic]] scripts (such as the [[Pahlavi scripts]]), all logograms are heterograms coming from Aramaic.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedia Iranica, [http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/huzwares Huswāreš].&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes such heterograms are referred to by terms identifying the source language such as "[[Sumerogram]]s" or "[[Aramaeogram]]s".

'''Jacques Ehrmann''' (31 March 1931 – 11 June 1972) was a French literary theorist and a faculty member of the [[Yale University]] French Department from 1961 until his death in 1972.

==Biography==
Jacques Ehrmann was born in [[Mulhouse]] (Haut-Rhin, [[France]]) on March 31, 1931, the son of Paul Ehrmann and Henriette Weber. Born in the [[Alsace]] region by a twist of fate, as both the Ehrmann and Weber families were originally from Alsace but had left after the 1871 loss to [[Germany]], it just happened that Mulhouse, then [[Strasbourg]], were the first assignments of his father, an Engineering graduate from "[[École Polytechnique]]".

The family, including his older brother Jean-Daniel (JD), came back to [[Paris]] in 1939 and he graduated from the [[Lycée Henri IV]] with a [[Baccalauréat]] in 1949, then studied at the [[Sorbonne]] where he obtained a Licence-des-Lettres in 1953. In the meantime, he received a [[Fulbright Program|Fulbright]] scholarship and spent an academic year from 1951 to 1952 at [[Carleton College]] in [[Northfield, Minnesota]], the "City of Colleges, Cows and Contentment", a logo he loved to quote.

He was called to military service from 1953 to 1955 and served in the "Régiment de Tirailleurs Algériens", and later as a translator in Germany for the US headquarters. During this time he met [[:fr:Pierre Riboulet|Pierre Riboulet]] who would go on to create the French architectural firm [[:fr:Atelier de Montrouge|l'Atelier de Montrouge]] with [[:fr:Gérard Thurnauer|Gérard Thurnauer]] (1926) and [[Jean-Louis Véret]] (1927) with whom he became lifelong friends while furthering his deep interest in [[Architecture]].

In 1956 he married Françoise Laborie and the couple moved to [[Los Angeles]] where he attended The University of California at Los Angeles ([[University of California, Los Angeles|UCLA]]) and received a [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] in French Literature in 1961. There he met and befriended [[Raymond Federman]] with whom he perfected his tennis game. From 1959 to 1961 he taught at [[Pomona College]] in [[Claremont, California|Claremont]] California while completing his doctoral dissertation.

Concurrently working as a freelance correspondent for ''France Presse'' he was offered a full-time assignment in [[New York City]] at the same time as he was invited to join the [[Yale University]] Faculty. Having to choose between journalism and academia, he chose Yale University in 1961. He lived in Hamden, Connecticut, with his wife and two sons.

As full professor he taught there in the French and Comparative Literature Departments and edited three issues of the "[https://web.archive.org/web/20090129125947/http://research.yale.edu/frenchstudies/ Yale French Studies]" review which were later published as books. He was very involved in academic activities including lectures, conferences, and colloquia ... and continued to work through a long illness until his premature death on June 11, 1972.

He leaves two sons, Guillaume, born February 24, 1959, and Laurent, born December 27, 1961.

'''Julio Correa Myzkowsky''' (August 30, 1890 – July 14, 1953) was a Paraguayan poet in [[Guarani language]].

Correa's maternal grandfather, Myzkowsky, was of [[Poles|Polish]] origin, while his father was [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]]. Correa left school at young age.

He started to publish his poems in 1926.

Encouraged by the poet [[Manuel Ortiz Guerrero]], he started to write an article titled “Dialoguitos Callejeros” (Small Street Dialogues) in the newspaper Guarani, of [[Facundo Recalde]].

His talent became apparent during the [[Chaco War]]. His work in the Guarani language was very well received by the public and became known as an author, actor and director.

From 1934 to 1936, he published his poems in the magazine Guarania, of [[Juan Natalicio González|Natalicio González]]. Those became part, later on, of the book Body and Soul. (1943). In 1947, he was arrested because of his writings. The civil war that year had a negative effect on the author, and he became depressed. He remained isolated in his country house in [[Luque]], where he died on July 14, 1953.

== Childhood and youth ==

He came from a well-to-do family that had fallen on hard times as a result of adversities in the aftermath of the war of 1870. His work is, without doubt, the utmost expression of creation of Paraguayan dramatic art and the Guarani theatre, always inspired in social subjects. Descendant of Brazilian people, his father fought in the war and once it ended, decided to stay in [[Paraguay]], like many other soldiers at the time. As a child he grew among people that talk Guaraní, among countryman and peons, and it was from that time, he started to acknowledge their struggles to survive. When he became a grown man, he discovered himself as able to read this people, as an interpreter to them, in the theater as in the social action.

He was very good friends with the sculptor [[Erminio Blotta]] (from [[Rosario]], [[Argentina]]), honorary citizen of Paraguay.

== His family ==

Married with the notorious actress, [[Georgina Martínez]]. They founded together a theatre company, with which he traveled to every part of Paraguay, carrying a message condemning the injustice of large entailed lands and the exploit of the working country man.

== Trajectory ==

[[Walter Wey]], a Brazilian researcher, makes a colorful portrait of the multifaceted Correa: “Who does not know and admire Julio Correa? Poet, dramatist, businessman, storyteller and distiller of politic and literary poisons. Maybe the victims, men and women of his satirical stories, felt disrespected but all of them know those stories by memory. Hearing Correa recite them in Palma Street or in his country house in Luque constituted one of the most beautiful shows to witness. It was because of this, that he was persecuted and sometimes put in jail, to satisfaction of his detractors. But the applause and admiration of the people kept him going.

He was the creator of the Guarani theatre, its greater author and also its best actor. With great intuition he felt the Paraguayan problematic was the unjust distribution of land, because it was just like Justo Pastor Benítez wrote: “the Paraguayan people are just a mere occupant of his own land”. Correa had this saying for truth and became a fighter for the cause, standing against foreign and national large entailed land with enormous courage. In his house in Luque a single book cannot be seen, only farm animals, there is nothing that reminiscence the house of a poet.

Julio Correa is a poet without culture and, what’s more interesting, without the desire or preoccupation to acquire it. The poems in Spanish language he gathered in his book “Alma y Cuerpo” (Body and Soul) closed a period in time and marked the beginning of a new road, that would be widened by [[Hérib Campos Cervera]], with the introduction of the “literature of vanguard” 
It is Campos Cervera, that completes the description of Correa, saying: “He is the great creator of images of our society and problematic, the drama of misery, land, blood and jealousy”.

The Paraguayan people have Correa as a mirror of its hope, pain, and joy. He did not settle for just creating a story character, he also manifested their joy and sadness, and their moral ups and downs. In stage, he showed the audience the different shades of passion, all the rage of hatred and the goodness of compassion, his voice transmitted the sentiment of his art.

== Work ==

His production includes:
* Ñane mba’era’y (What cannot be ours)
* Guerra aja (During the war)
* Karai Ulogio (Mister Ulogio)
* Tereko yevy fréntepe (Go back to the front)
* Pleito rire (After the dispute)
* Péicha guarante (Just like that)
* Sandía yvyguy (Hidden watermelon)
* Karu poka (Poor eating)
* Honorio causa (Because of Honorio)
* Po’a nda ja jokoi (Luck is not stopped)
* Sombrero kaá (Guarani expression that means “the lover of another one’s love)
Julio Correa also wrote Yvy yara, Toribio, Yuaijhugui reí, Po’a rusuva and La culpa de bueno.

Among his stories are Nicolasia del Espiritu Santo (1943), El Padre Cantalicio, El borracho de la casa and El hombre que robó una pava (unconcluded), all of these were published after his death.

== Last Years ==

He died on July 14, 1953 in [[Luque]], [[Paraguay]], city close to the Paraguayan capital. His house is nowadays the “Museum Julio Correa”.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3685">'''Ku''' is a [[fictional language]] appearing in the [[2005 in film|2005]] [[drama film|drama]]/[[thriller film]] ''[[The Interpreter]]''. In the film, Ku is a language spoken in the [[fictional country|fictional]] [[Africa]]n country of [[Matobo (fictional country)|Matobo]]. The [[constructed language]] was created for the film by [[Said el-Gheithy]], the director of the [[Centre for African Language Learning]] in [[Covent Garden]], [[London]]. Commissioned by ''The Interpreter's'' director, [[Sydney Pollack]], and [[Working Title Films]], el-Gheithy adapted aspects of [[Shona language|Shona]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/002083.html Article on Language Log, April 21, 2005]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Swahili language|Swahili]], languages spoken in Eastern and Southern [[Africa]], to devise the basis of this fictional language. The language has its own internal [[dictionary]] and el-Gheithy created a whole culture and history in his mind.&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.latimes.com/2005/apr/27/entertainment/et-kingku27 Article in the Los Angeles Times, April 27, 2005]&lt;/ref&gt;

In this context, the actual language spoken by the ''Tobosa'' people of the fictional Democratic Republic of Matobo, although known as 'Ku' to foreigners, is indigenously known as ''Chitob uk u'' which literally means 'the language of the Tobosa people'. ''Ch'itoboku'', then, would be the only surviving ancient Bantu language, and the Tobosa oral traditions indicate that 'Ku' is the root of modern Bantu languages spoken in contemporary [[Sub-Saharan Africa]].  There is no gender distinction, hence the word for 'he' or 'she' is the same, 'a'. Verbosity is positively valued in ''Ch'itoboku'', and ordinary speech should approximate the elegance of poetry.

As with most [[Culture of Africa|African cultures]], ''Tobosa'' customs are based on age and gender. Drawing on the historical tradition, elders greet younger generations first, and women speak before men. Greetings are essentially verbal, but are followed by a touching of foreheads. The most common expression in greeting is 'sonna', meaning 'hello', but a more energised greeting is ''kwambu'', and the response is ''kwamb uk uu'', 'and how are you?'

There is not a single word for 'thanks,' but the word ''tenane'' is used to show appreciation and is expressed through the [[clapping]] of hands. Men clap with their palms and fingers together, while women clap with their hands across each other. During meetings and conversation, sneezing is an indication of disbelief. On leaving, one would say ''digai'', which actually means 'you haven't gone for ever, we will see you again'. The person staying responds by saying ''{{not a typo|digaidigai}}''.

The language and cultures of the Tobosa have been influenced by links with the outside world through colonialism and more recently as a result of processes of globalisation. For example, modern technology has become part of the modern 'Ku' vocabulary, and is now written and pronounced as ''Kompyutanga''. Matobo is currently enjoying more prosperity, not from the usual gas and mineral resources, but rather from its special herbal tea, ''zingwe'', drinking of which is believed to guarantee eternal youth.

'''''Lost in Translation''''' is a 2003 [[Romance film|romantic]] [[comedy-drama]] film written and directed by [[Sofia Coppola]]. It stars [[Bill Murray]] as aging actor Bob Harris, who befriends college graduate Charlotte ([[Scarlett Johansson]]) in a Tokyo hotel.

''Lost in Translation'' was nominated for four [[Academy Awards]], including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]] for Bill Murray, and [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]] for Coppola; Coppola won for [[Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay|Best Original Screenplay]]. Murray and Johansson each won a [[BAFTA]] award for [[BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role|Best Actor in a Leading Role]] and [[BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role|Best Actress in a Leading Role]] respectively. The film grossed $119 million on a budget of $4 million.

==Plot==
Bob Harris, an aging American movie star, arrives in Tokyo to film an advertisement for [[Suntory]] whisky. Charlotte, a young college graduate, is left in her hotel room by her husband, John, a celebrity photographer on assignment in Tokyo. Charlotte is unsure of her future with John, feeling detached from his lifestyle and disillusioned about their relationship. Bob's own 25-year marriage is strained as he goes through a [[midlife crisis]].

Each day, Bob and Charlotte encounter each other in the hotel, and finally meet at the hotel bar one night when neither can sleep. Eventually, Charlotte invites Bob to meet with some local friends of hers. The two bond through a fun night in Tokyo, welcomed without prejudice by Charlotte's friends and experiencing Japanese nightlife and culture. In the days that follow, Bob and Charlotte's platonic relationship develops as they spend more time together. One night, each unable to sleep, the two share an intimate conversation about Charlotte's personal troubles and Bob's married life.

On the penultimate night of his stay, Bob sleeps with the hotel bar's female jazz singer. The next morning Charlotte arrives at his room to invite him for lunch and overhears the woman in his room, leading to an argument over lunch. Later that night, during a fire alarm at the hotel, Bob and Charlotte reconcile and express how they will miss each other as they make a final visit to the hotel bar.

The following morning, Bob is set to return to the United States. He tells Charlotte goodbye at the hotel lobby and sadly watches her walk back to the elevator. In a taxi to the airport, Bob sees Charlotte on a crowded street and gets out and goes to her. He embraces the tearful Charlotte and whispers something in her ear. The two share a kiss, say goodbye and Bob departs.

==Analysis==
Over the course of the film, several things are "lost in translation".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A03E6DD103AF932A1575AC0A9659C8B63 |title=What Else Was Lost in Translation |accessdate=May 2, 2012 |last=Rich |first=Motoko |date=September 21, 2003 |work=[[The New York Times]]|quote= It doesn't take much to figure out that 'Lost in Translation,' the title of Sofia Coppola's elegiac new film about two lonely American souls in Tokyo, means more than one thing. There is the cultural dislocation felt by Bob Harris (Bill Murray), a washed-up movie actor, and Charlotte (Scarlett Johansson), a young wife trying to find herself. They are also lost in their marriages, lost in their lives. As Charlotte says, 'I just feel so alone, even with people around.' Then, of course, there is the simple matter of language.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bob (Murray), a Japanese director ([[Diamond Yukai|Yutaka Tadokoro]]), and an interpreter (Takeshita) are on a set, filming a commercial for [[Suntory]] whisky (specifically, 17-year-old [[Hibiki (whisky)|Hibiki]]). In several exchanges, the director gives lengthy, impassioned directives in Japanese. These are invariably followed by brief, incomplete translations from the interpreter.

In addition to the meaning and detail lost in the translation of the director's words, the two central characters in the film—Bob and Charlotte—are also lost in other ways. On a basic level, they are lost in the alien [[culture of Japan|Japanese culture]]. But in addition, they are lost in their own lives and relationships, a feeling, amplified by their displaced location, that leads to their blossoming friendship and growing connection with one another.&lt;ref name="Gehring2004"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gehring |first=Wes D. |date=January 2004 |title=Along Comes Another Coppola |journal=[[USA Today (magazine)|USA Today]] |volume=132 |page=59|publisher=The Society for the Advancement of Education |issn=0161-7389}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By her own admission, Coppola wanted to create a romantic movie about two characters that have a moment of connection. The story's timeline was intentionally shortened to emphasize this moment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=October 2003|title=The Co-Conspirators|journal=Interview|volume=33|issue=9|page=56|publisher=Interview, Inc.|location=New York|issn=0149-8932}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, Coppola has said that since "there's not much happening in the story besides [Bob and Charlotte's relationship]", the filmmakers tried to keep an ongoing tension.&lt;ref name="Carter"&gt;{{cite news|title=Famous lost words|first=Kelly|last=Carter|date=September 21, 2003|work=[[South China Morning Post]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Murray has described his biggest challenge in portraying Bob as managing the character's conflicted feelings. On one hand, Murray said, Bob knows that it could be dangerous to become too close to Charlotte, but on the other, he is lonely and knows that having an affair would be easy. Murray worked to portray a balance between being affectionate and being "respectable".&lt;ref name="Murray 1"/&gt;

The academic Marco Abel lists ''Lost in Translation'' as one of many films that belong to the category of "postromance" cinema, which he says offers a negative perspective of love, sex, romance, and dating. According to Abel, the characters in such films reject the idealized notion of lifelong monogamy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Abel|first=Marco|year=2010|title=Failing to Connect: Itinerations of Desire in  Oskar Roehler's Postromance Films|journal=New German Critique|volume=37|issue=1|series=109|page=77|publisher=New German Critique, Inc.|doi=10.1215/0094033X-2009-018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The author and filmmaker Anita Schillhorn van Veen interprets the film as a criticism of [[modernity]], in which Tokyo is a contemporary "[[Ukiyo|floating world]]" of fleeting pleasures that are too alienating and amoral to facilitate meaningful relationships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schillhorn van Veen|first=Anita|date=March 1, 2006|title=The Floating World: Representations of Japan in ''Lost in Translation'' and ''Demonlover''|journal=Asian Cinema|volume=17|issue=1|pages=190–193|issn=1059-440X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tessa Dwyer, writing for ''Linguistica Antverpiensia, New Series – Themes in Translation Studies'', called ''Lost in Translation'' a [[Polyglotism|polyglot]] film that challenges the film industry's "more usual tendency to ignore or deny issues of language difference" by highlighting Bob and Charlotte's difficult contact with the Japanese language.&lt;ref name="Dwyer"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dwyer|first=Tessa|year=2005|title=Universally speaking: Lost in Translation and polyglot cinema |url=https://lans-tts.uantwerpen.be/index.php/LANS-TTS/article/view/143 |journal=Linguistica Antverpiensia, New Series – Themes in Translation Studies |issue=4 |pages=297–300 |publisher=Department of Translators and Interpreters, Antwerp University |accessdate=February 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aesthetics===
The author and lecturer Maria San Filippo contends that the film's setting, Tokyo, is an audiovisual metaphor for Bob and Charlotte's world views. She explains that the calm ambience of the city's hotel represents Bob's desire to be secure and undisturbed, while the energetic atmosphere of the city streets represents Charlotte's willingness to engage with the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=San Filippo|first=Maria|year=2003|title=Lost in Translation|journal=Cineaste|volume=29|issue=1|page=28|publisher=Cineaste|location=New York|issn=0009-7004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coppola and Acord, the film's cinematographer, agreed that ''Lost in Translation'' needed to rely heavily on visual expression to support the characters' romance.

Robert Hahn, an essayist writing for ''[[The Southern Review]]'', suggested that the filmmakers deliberately used [[chiaroscuro]], the art of using strong contrasts between light and dark to support the story. He wrote that the film's dominant light tones symbolize feelings of humor and romance, and they are contrasted with dark tones that symbolize underlying feelings of despondency. He compared this to the technique of the painter [[John Singer Sargent]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hahn|first=Robert|year=2006|title=Dancing in the Dark|journal=The Southern Review|volume=42|issue=1|pages=153–154|issn=0038-4534}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film's opening shot, which features a close shot of Charlotte sitting in translucent pink underwear, has interested various commentators. In particular, it has been compared to the portraitures of the painter [[John Kacere]] and the image of [[Brigitte Bardot]] in the opening scene of the 1963 film ''[[Contempt (film)|Contempt]]''. Dwyer wrote that when the two shots are compared, they reveal the importance of language difference, as both films highlight the complexities involved with characters speaking multiple languages.&lt;ref name="Dwyer"/&gt; Filippo wrote that while the image in ''Contempt'' is used to remark on [[sexual objectification]], Coppola "doesn't seem to be making a statement at all beyond a sort of endorsement of beauty for beauty's sake".&lt;ref name="San2003"&gt;{{cite journal|last=San Filippo|first=Maria|year=2003|title=Lost in Translation |journal=Cineaste |volume=29 |issue=1 |page=26 |publisher=Cineaste |location=New York |issn=0009-7004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Coppola revealed in a 2013 interview that the shot is indeed based on the art of Kacere.&lt;ref name="Stern"&gt;{{cite web|title=Sofia Coppola Discusses ‘Lost in Translation’ on Its 10th Anniversary |url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2013/09/12/sofia-coppola-discusses-lost-in-translation-on-its-10th-anniversary.html |first=Marlow|last=Stern |date=September 12, 2013 |work=[[The Daily Beast]]|accessdate=February 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Geoff King]], a professor of film at [[Brunel University]] (who published a book on the film, under the same name in a series titled "American indies", in 2010), contends that the shot is marked by an "obvious" appeal in its potential eroticism, and a "subtle" appeal in its artistic qualities. He used the shot as an example of the film's obvious attractions, which are characteristic of [[Major film studio|mainstream film]], and its subtle ones, which are typified by [[Independent film#The "Indie Film" Movement|"indie" film]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=King|first=Geoff|editor=Gary Needham and Yannis Tzioumakis|title=Lost in Translation|series=American Indies|year=2010|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|location=Edinburgh|isbn=9780748637461|pages=1–2|chapter=Introduction}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Coppola spent six months writing the film, beginning with "short stories" and "impressions" that culminated in a 70-page script.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.screenwritersutopia.com/modules.php?name=Content&amp;pa=showpage&amp;pid=57 |title=Sofia Coppola on LOST IN TRANSLATION |publisher=Screenwritersutopia.com |date=March 11, 2004 |accessdate=April 7, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120216010832/http://www.screenwritersutopia.com/modules.php?name=Content&amp;pa=showpage&amp;pid=57 |archivedate=February 16, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="filmmakermagazine"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.filmmakermagazine.com/issues/fall2003/features/tokyo_story.php |title=Sofia Coppola's Lost in Translation - Filmmaker Magazine - Fall 2003 |publisher=Filmmaker Magazine |accessdate=April 7, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120414022213/http://www.filmmakermagazine.com/issues/fall2003/features/tokyo_story.php |archivedate=April 14, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; She wanted to create a story that was "a little more funny and romantic" than her previous feature, ''[[The Virgin Suicides (film)|The Virgin Suicides]]'', and she spent little time planning or rewriting it.&lt;ref name="Carter" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chumo|first=Peter N.

Coppola first noticed Scarlett Johansson in ''[[Manny &amp; Lo]]'', where she related to her "understated" and "subtle" demeanor,&lt;ref name="filmmakermagazine" /&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://movies.about.com/cs/lostintranslation/a/lostsofia_2.htm|title=Interview with "Lost in Translation" Star Bill Murray|publisher=|accessdate=August 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; envisioning her as a "young [[Lauren Bacall]]-type girl".&lt;ref name="Stern"/&gt; Johansson, who was 17 years old at the time, immediately accepted the part and Coppola was happy with the maturity she brought to the character.&lt;ref name="nytimes" /&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; In writing the story, Coppola said she was influenced by the relationship between Humphrey Bogart and [[Lauren Bacall]] in Howard Hawks' ''[[The Big Sleep (1946 film)|The Big Sleep]]''.&lt;ref name="filmmakermagazine" /&gt; Murray and Johansson did not do any auditions before filming.&lt;ref name="Stern"/&gt;

===Filming===
Lance Acord, the film's director of photography, has written that the cinematographic style of ''Lost in Translation'' is largely based on "daily experiences, memories and impressions" of his time in Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Acord|first=Lance|authorlink=Lance Acord|date=January 2004|title=Channeling Tokyo for ''Lost in Translation''|journal=American Cinematographer|volume=85|issue=1|pages=123–124|publisher=American Society of Cinematographers|issn=0002-7928}}&lt;/ref&gt; He worked closely with Coppola to visualize the film, relying on multiple experiences he shared with her in Tokyo before production took place. [[Location scouting]] was carried out by Coppola, Acord, and Ross Katz; and Coppola created 40 pages of photographs for the crew so that they would understand her visual intentions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chumo|first=Peter N. II|date=January–February 2004|title=Sofia Coppola|journal=Creative Screenwriting|volume=11|issue=1|page=57|issn=1084-8665}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Acord sought to maximize [[available light]] during shooting and use [[Stage lighting instrument|artificial lights]] as little as possible. He described this approach as conservative compared to "the more conventional Hollywood system", for which some of the crew's Japanese electricians thought he was "out of his mind".&lt;ref name="Ballinger2004"&gt;{{cite book|first=Alex|last=Ballinger|title=New Cinematographers|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=10kR9a9SYnMC&amp;pg=PA16|accessdate=April 6, 2012|date=October 12, 2004|publisher=Laurence King Publishing|isbn=978-1-85669-334-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, Acord did not use any artificial lights to photograph the film's night-time exteriors.&lt;ref name="Ballinger2004" /&gt; ''Lost in Translation'' was largely shot in an improvised, "free-form" manner, which Coppola described as "stealthy" and "almost documentary-style".&lt;ref name="indiewire" /&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;{{cite video|title=Lost in Translation|date=2004|publisher= Focus Features/Universal Studios|medium= DVD}}&lt;/ref&gt; The crew shot in some locations without permits, including Tokyo's subways and [[Shibuya, Tokyo#Shibuya Crossing|Shibuya Crossing]]; they avoided police by keeping a minimal crew.&lt;ref name=autogenerated5 /&gt; Acord avoided grandiose camera movements in favor of still shots to avoid taking away from the loneliness of the characters.&lt;ref name="Ballinger2004" /&gt;

Most of the film was shot on an [[Aaton]] camera with [[35 mm film|35 mm film stock]], using [[List of motion picture film stocks#VISION color negative (ECN-2 process 1996–2002)|Kodak Vision 500T 5263]] stock for nightlight exteriors and Kodak Vision 320T 5277 stock in daylight. A smaller [[Moviecam Compact]] was used in confined locations. Coppola said that her father, [[Francis Ford Coppola]], tried to convince her to shoot on video, but she ultimately decided on film, describing its "fragmented, dislocated, melancholic, romantic feeling", in contrast with video, which is "more immediate, in the present".&lt;ref name="filmmakermagazine" /&gt; In interviews, she said she wanted to shoot Tokyo with a spontaneous "informality", similar to the "way a snapshot looks", and she chose to shoot on high-speed film stocks to evoke a "homemade intimacy".&lt;ref name="Betts" /&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated5 /&gt;&lt;ref name="filmmakermagazine" /&gt; Some scenes were shot wholly for mood and were captured without sound.&lt;ref name="Betts" /&gt;

''Lost in Translation'' was shot six days per week in September and October 2002, over the course of 27 days.&lt;ref name="Betts" /&gt; During this time, videotape footage was mailed to editor Sarah Flack in [[New York City]], where she began editing the film in a Red Car office.&lt;ref name="Crabtree"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Crabtree|first=Sheigh|date=September 10, 2003|title=Editor Flack in Fashion for Coppola's "Lost" Pic|journal=The Hollywood Reporter}}&lt;/ref&gt; The scenes with Bob and Charlotte together were largely shot in order.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chumo|first=Peter N. II|date=January–February 2004|title=Sofia Coppola|journal=Creative Screenwriting|volume=11|issue=1|page=64|issn=1084-8665}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the interior scenes were shot overnight, because the hotel did not allow the crew to shoot in much of its public space until after 1 a.m.&lt;ref name="Ballinger2004" /&gt;

Various locations were used during production; in particular, the bar featured prominently in the film is the New York Bar, which is situated on the 52nd floor of the [[Shinjuku Park Tower]] and part of the Park Hyatt in [[Shinjuku, Tokyo]]. Other locations include the [[Heian Jingu]] shrine in [[Kyoto]] and the steps of the San-mon gate at [[Nanzen-ji]], as well as the club Air in the [[Daikanyama]] district of Tokyo. All of the locations mentioned in the film are the names of actual places that existed in Tokyo at the time of filming. Murray described the first few weeks of the shoot as like "being held prisoner", since he was affected by [[jet lag]], and Johansson said the shoot made her "busy, vulnerable and tired".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2004/jan/01/1 | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Geoffrey | last=MacNab | title=Geoffrey Macnab talks to Bill Murray | date=January 1, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2003/dec/28/features.magazine | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Polly | last=Vernon | title=Polly Vernon meets Scarlett Johansson | date=January 5, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Coppola spoke of the challenges of directing the movie with a Japanese crew, since she had to rely on her assistant director to make translations.&lt;ref name="indiewire" /&gt; Much of the performances were improvised, and Coppola openly allowed modifications to dialogue during shooting. For example, the dialogue in the scene with Harris and the still photographer was unrehearsed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chumo|first=Peter N. II|date=January–February 2004|title=Sofia Coppola|journal=Creative Screenwriting|volume=11|issue=1|pages=58–59|issn=1084-8665}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coppola has said that she was attracted to the idea of Bob and Charlotte going through stages of a romantic relationship all in one week&amp;mdash;in which they have met, courted, hurt each other, and discussed intimate life. To conclude this relationship, Coppola wanted a special ending even though she thought the concluding scene in the script was mundane. Coppola instructed Murray to perform the kiss in that scene without telling Johansson, to which she reacted without preparation. The whisper was also unscripted, but too quiet to be recorded. While Coppola initially considered having audible dialogue dubbed into the moment, she later decided that it was better to keep it "between the two of 
them."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chumo|first=Peter N. II|date=January–February 2004|title=Sofia Coppola|journal=Creative Screenwriting|volume=11|issue=1|pages=63–64|issn=1084-8665}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After filming, Coppola and Flack spent approximately 10 weeks editing the film.&lt;ref name="Crabtree" /&gt; In the bonus features of the film's DVD, Murray called ''Lost in Translation'' his favorite film that he has worked on,&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt; and Coppola described the film as her most "personal", since much of the story is based on her own experiences.&lt;ref name="Stern"/&gt; For example, Charlotte's relationship with her husband is based on Coppola's relationship with her husband,  [[Spike Jonze]], when they first married, and the "Suntory" commercial is based on a commercial Coppola's father, [[Francis Ford Coppola]], shot with [[Akira Kurosawa]].&lt;ref name="Stern"/&gt;

===Music===
{{main|Lost in Translation (soundtrack)}}
The film's [[Lost in Translation (soundtrack)|soundtrack]], supervised by [[Brian Reitzell]], was released on September 9, 2003 by [[Emperor Norton Records]]. It contains five songs by [[Kevin Shields]], including one from his group [[My Bloody Valentine (band)|My Bloody Valentine]]. Coppola said much of the soundtrack consisted of songs that she "liked and had been listening to", and she worked with Reitzell to make Tokyo [[dream pop]] mixes.&lt;ref name="Stern"/&gt; The soundtrack also included [[The Jesus and Mary Chain]] hit "[[Just Like Honey]]". [[Allmusic]] gave the soundtrack four out of five stars, saying "Coppola's impressionistic romance ''Lost in Translation'' features an equally impressionistic and romantic soundtrack that plays almost as big a role in the film as Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson do."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Phares |first=Heather |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/lost-in-translation-mw0000316244 |title=Lost in Translation – Original Soundtrack |publisher=[[Allmusic]]. [[Rovi Corporation]] |accessdate=October 10, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Agathi Glezakos, an academic writing a review of ''Lost in Translation'' shortly after its release, wrote that the music in the film's karaoke scene constitutes a common "language" that allows Bob and Charlotte to connect with some of the Japanese people amidst their alienation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Glezakos|first=Agathi|date=October 15, 2003|title=Movie Review: ''Lost in Translation''|journal=Reflections: Narratives of Professional Helping|volume=9|issue=4|pages=71–72|publisher=[[California State University, Long Beach]]|issn=1080-0220}}&lt;/ref&gt; In that scene, the rendition of the [[Pretenders (band)|Pretenders]]' "[[Brass in Pocket]]" was selected to showcase a lively side of Charlotte, and "[[(What's So Funny 'Bout) Peace, Love, and Understanding]]" was chosen to establish that Bob is from a different generation. Both Coppola and Murray finally selected [[Roxy Music]]'s "[[More Than This (Roxy Music song)|More Than This]]" during the shoot itself because they liked the band and thought the lyrics fit the story.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chumo|first=Peter N.

===Critical response===
''Lost in Translation'' received critical acclaim, particularly for Coppola's direction and screenplay and Murray and Johansson's performances. It has a score of 95% on [[Rotten Tomatoes]], with an average rating of 8.4/10 based on 227 reviews. The site's critical consensus states: "Effectively balancing humor and subtle pathos, Sofia Coppola crafts a moving, melancholy story that serves as a showcase for both Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson".&lt;ref name="rottentomatoes"&gt;{{cite web|title = Lost in Translation|work = Rotten Tomatoes|accessdate = March 19, 2010|url = http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/lost_in_translation/}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film also holds a score of 89 out of 100 based on 43 reviews on [[Metacritic]], indicating "universal acclaim".&lt;ref name="metacritic"&gt;{{cite web|title=Lost in Translation|work=Metacritic|accessdate=May 25, 2011|url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/lost-in-translation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critic [[Roger Ebert]] gave ''Lost in Translation'' four out of four stars and named it the second best film of the year, describing it as "sweet and sad at the same time as it is sardonic and funny".&lt;ref name="ebert"&gt;{{cite news | last = Ebert | first = Roger | authorlink= Roger Ebert | title = ''Lost in Translation'' | work = [[Chicago Sun-Times]] | pages = | language = | publisher = | date = September 12, 2003 | url = http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20030912/REVIEWS/309120302/1023 | accessdate = March 16, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In his review for ''[[The New York Times]]'', [[Elvis Mitchell]] wrote: "At 18, [Johansson] gets away with playing a 25-year-old woman by using her husky voice to test the level of acidity in the air ... Ms. Johansson is not nearly as accomplished a performer as Mr. Murray, but Ms. Coppola gets around this by using Charlotte's simplicity and curiosity as keys to her character."&lt;ref name="elvis"&gt;{{cite news | last = Mitchell | first = Elvis | authorlink= Elvis Mitchell | title = An American in Japan, Making a Connection | work = [[The New York Times]] | publisher = | date = September 12, 2003 | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2003/09/12/movies/film-review-an-american-in-japan-making-a-connection.html | accessdate = March 16, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' gave the film an "A" rating and Lisa Schwarzbaum wrote: "Working opposite the embracing, restful serenity of Johansson, Murray reveals something more commanding in his repose than we have ever seen before. Trimmed to a newly muscular, rangy handsomeness and in complete rapport with his character's hard-earned acceptance of life's limitations, Murray turns in a great performance."&lt;ref name="schwarzbaum−"&gt;{{cite news | last = Schwarzbaum | first = Lisa | title = ''Lost in Translation'' | work = [[Entertainment Weekly]] | pages = | language = | publisher = | date = September 10, 2003 | url = http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,479937,00.html | accessdate = March 16, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his review for ''[[The New York Observer]]'', [[Andrew Sarris]] called the film "that rarity of rarities, a grown-up romance based on the deliberate repression of sexual gratification ... when independent films are exploding with erotic images edging ever closer to outright pornography, Ms. Coppola and her colleagues have replaced sexual facility with emotional longing, without being too coy or self-congratulatory in the process."&lt;ref name="sarris"&gt;{{cite news | last = Sarris | first = Andrew | title = Lonely Souls in a Strange Land: ''Lost in Translation'' Maps the Way | work = [[New York Observer]] | pages = | language = | publisher = | date = September 28, 2003 | url = http://www.observer.com/node/48113 | accessdate = March 16, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''[[USA Today]]'' gave the film three and a half stars out of four and wrote that it "offers quiet humor in lieu of the bludgeoning direct assaults most comedies these days inflict".&lt;ref name="clark"&gt;{{cite news | last = Clark | first = Mike | title = Comedy doesn't get lost in ''Translation'' | work = [[USA Today]] | pages = | language = | publisher = | date = September 12, 2003 | url = https://www.usatoday.com/life/movies/reviews/2003-09-11-translation_x.htm | accessdate = March 16, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]''{{'}}s Richard Corliss praised Murray's performance: "You won't find a subtler, funnier or more poignant performance this year than this quietly astonishing turn."&lt;ref name="corliss"&gt;{{cite news | last = Corliss | first = Richard | title = A Victory for Lonely Hearts | work = [[Time (magazine)|Time]] | pages = | language = | publisher = | date = September 15, 2003 | url = http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1005675,00.html | accessdate = March 16, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His performance has been likened to the sardonic persona of [[W.

Fields]].&lt;ref name="Gehring2004" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Alleva|first=Richard|date=December 5, 2003|title=About a Boy: Kill Bill-Volume 1 and Lost in Translation|journal=[[Commonweal (magazine)|Commonweal]]|volume=130|issue=21|page=14|publisher=Commonweal Foundation|issn=0010-3330}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his review for ''[[The Observer]]'', [[Philip French]] wrote: "While ''Lost in Translation'' is deeply sad and has a strongly [[Michelangelo Antonioni|Antonioniesque]] flavour, it's also a wispy romantic comedy with little plot and some well-observed comic moments."&lt;ref name="french"&gt;{{cite news | last = French | first = Philip | authorlink= Philip French | title = The odd Coppola | work = [[The Observer]] | pages = | language = | publisher = | date = January 11, 2004 | url = https://www.theguardian.com/film/2004/jan/11/philipfrench | accessdate = March 16, 2009 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In ''[[The Guardian]]'', [[Joe Queenan]] praised Coppola's film as "one of the few Hollywood films I have seen this year that has a brain; but more than that, it has a soul."&lt;ref name="queenan"&gt;{{cite news | last = Queenan | first = Joe | authorlink= Joe Queenan | title = A yen for romance | work = [[The Guardian]] | pages = | language = | publisher = | date = January 10, 2004 | url = https://www.theguardian.com/film/2004/jan/10/features.joequeenan | accessdate = March 16, 2009 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Rolling Stone]]''{{'}}s [[Peter Travers]] gave it four out of four stars and wrote: "Before saying goodbye, they whisper something to each other that the audience can't hear. Coppola keeps her film as hushed and intimate as that whisper. ''Lost in Translation'' is found gold. Funny how a wisp of a movie from a wisp of a girl can wipe you out."&lt;ref name="travers"&gt;{{cite news | last = Travers | first = Peter | title = ''Lost in Translation'' | work = [[Rolling Stone]] | pages = | language = | publisher = | date = September 8, 2003 | url = https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/reviews/lost-in-translation-20030908 | accessdate = March 10, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[J. Hoberman]], in his review for the ''[[Village Voice]]'', wrote: "''Lost in Translation'' is as bittersweet a brief encounter as any in American movies since [[Richard Linklater]]'s equally romantic ''[[Before Sunrise]]''. But ''Lost in Translation'' is the more poignant reverie. Coppola evokes the emotional intensity of a one-night stand far from home—but what she really gets is the magic of movies".&lt;ref name="hoberman"&gt;{{cite news | last = Hoberman | first = J | title = After Sunset | work = [[Village Voice]] | pages = | language = | publisher = | date = September 9, 2003 | url = http://www.villagevoice.com/2003-09-09/film/after-sunset/1 | accessdate = March 16, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2016 international critics' poll by the [[BBC]], ''Lost in Translation'' was voted the 22nd greatest film since 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.com/culture/story/20160819-the-21st-centurys-100-greatest-films |title=The 21st century's 100 greatest films |publisher=BBC |date=August 23, 2016 |accessdate=January 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Criticism ===
The film received some negative reviews, many from Japanese critics. Japanese TV critic Osugi {{small|{{bracket|[[:ja:おすぎ|ja]]}}}} of Osugi and [[Peeco|Piko]] fame said "The core story is cute and not bad; however, the depiction of Japanese people is terrible!"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2004/0419/p07s01-woap.html|title='Lost in Translation' doesn't translate well in Japan|first=Robert|last=Marquand|date=April 19, 2004|publisher=|accessdate=August 29, 2017|via=Christian Science Monitor}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a ''Guardian'' article about the film, Kiku Day, a musician specializing in the ''[[shakuhachi]]'' Japanese flute, wrote that she "couldn't help wondering not only whether I had watched a different movie, but whether the plaudits had come from a parallel universe of values"; according to Day, there is "no scene where the Japanese are afforded a shred of dignity. The viewer is sledgehammered into laughing at these small, yellow people and their funny ways."&lt;ref name="kikuguard"&gt;{{cite news| url= https://www.theguardian.com/world/2004/jan/24/japan.film | title= Totally lost in translation | date= January 24, 2004 | last= Day | first= Kiku | publisher=The Guardian | accessdate= October 10, 2010 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Day also said "while shoe-horning every possible caricature of modern Japan into her movie, Coppola is respectful of ancient Japan. It is depicted approvingly, though ancient traditions have very little to do with the contemporary Japanese. The good Japan, according to this director, is Buddhist monks chanting, ancient temples, [[Ikebana|flower arrangement]]; meanwhile she portrays the contemporary Japanese as ridiculous people who have lost contact with their own culture."&lt;ref name="kikuguard" /&gt;

Hawaiian filmmaker and author E. Koohan Paik wrote that "The Japanese are presented not as people, but as clowns" and that "''Lost in Translation'' relies wholly on the "[[Other (philosophy)|other]]ness" of the Japanese to give meaning to its protagonists, shape to its plot, and color to its scenery. The inaccessibility of Japan functions as an extension of the alienation and loneliness Bob and Charlotte feel in their personal lives, thus laying the perfect conditions for romance to germinate: they're the only ones who understand each other. Take away the cartooniness of the Japanese and the humor falls flat, the main characters' intense yearning is neutralized and the plot evaporates."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asianamericanfilm.com/archives/000602.html|title=Asian American Film: Commentary|website=www.asianamericanfilm.com|accessdate=August 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In another ''Guardian'' article, journalist David Stubbs described ''Lost in Translation'' as "mopey, self-pitying drivel", and its characters as "spoiled, bored, rich, utterly unsympathetic Americans".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url= https://www.theguardian.com/film/2004/dec/04/culture.features | title= No more heroes: film | date= December 4, 2004 | last= Stubbs | first= David | publisher=The Guardian | accessdate= June 19, 2012 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an article published in a 2004 issue of ''[[Maclean's]]'', Steve Burgess criticized the film as an ethnocentric "compendium of unpleasant stereotypes ... indicative of the way visitors and foreign workers often view Japan."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Burgess|first=Steve|date=April 26, 2004|title=Found in Translation|journal=[[Maclean's]]|volume=117|issue=17|pages=38–39|publisher=Rogers Communications|issn=0024-9262}}&lt;/ref&gt; Robin Antepara, an educator writing for an issue of ''[[Commonweal (magazine)|Commonweal]]'', wrote that while the story embodies stereotypes, "Charlotte is the personification of Japanese watchfulness," an often neglected virtue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Antepara|first=Robin|date=April 8, 2005|title=Culture Matters: Americans through Japanese Eyes|journal=[[Commonweal (magazine)|Commonweal]]|volume=132|issue=7|pages=10–11|publisher=Commonweal Foundation|issn=0010-3330}}&lt;/ref&gt; The academic Maria San Filippo wrote that the "retreat into America-centrism would be disappointing if, again, it were not so truthful ... Coppola knows firsthand that American tourists rarely get to know any Japanese well enough to discover their depth as sympathetic human beings."&lt;ref name="San2003" /&gt; Katz responded to some of the criticism by saying "Sofia's love of Japan and love of the people that she's met there is incredibly evident in the film... Literally, we recounted experiences that I think all of us had gone through," and that none of the scenes were "any slight to Japanese people."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Land Of the Rising Cliché|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/01/04/movies/land-of-the-rising-cliche.html|first=Motoko|last=Rich|date=January 4, 2004 |author2=Lukas Schwarzacher |author3=Fumie Tomita|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=March 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Marilyn Frye''' (born 1941 in [[Tulsa]], [[Oklahoma]]) is an American philosopher and [[radical feminist|radical feminist theorist]].  She is known for her theories on [[sexism]], [[racism]], [[oppression]], and sexuality.  Her writings offer discussions of feminist topics, such as: [[white supremacy]], [[male privilege]], and gay and lesbian [[marginalization]]. Although she approaches the issues from the perspective of justice, she is also deeply engaged with the [[metaphysics]], [[epistemology]], and [[moral psychology]] of social categories.

==Education and career==
Frye received the BA with honors in philosophy from [[Stanford University]] in 1963 and received the PhD in Philosophy at [[Cornell University]] in 1969, writing a dissertation titled "Meaning and Illocutionary Force," under the supervision of [[Max Black]]. Before coming to [[Michigan State University]] in 1974, she taught in the Philosophy Department at the [[University of Pittsburgh]]. From 2003 until her retirement, Frye was University Distinguished Professor at [[Michigan State University]]; she also served as Associate Dean for Graduate Studies of the College of Arts and Letters.   In 2008 she was the [[Phi Beta Kappa Society|Phi Beta Kappa]] Romanell Lecturer.

==Research and publications==
Frye is the author of ''[[The Politics of Reality]]''&lt;ref&gt;Frye, Marilyn. The Politics of Reality: Essays in Feminist Theory, The Crossing Press, 1983, {{ISBN|0-89594-099-X}}, p175&lt;/ref&gt; (1983), a collection of nine essays which has become a "classic" of feminist philosophy.&lt;ref name=Cudd&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cudd|first=Ann|title=Frye, Marilyn (1941-)|journal=Encyclopedia of Philosophy|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In her chapter entitled "Oppression" in the book ''Feminist Frontiers'', Frye discusses the idea of the [[double bind]] in gender. This double bind refers to "situations in which options are reduced to a very few and all of them expose one to penalty, censure or deprivation". Frye applies this principle to gender and the dilemma women often face in her discussion of oppression. For example, it is neither socially acceptable for a women to be sexually active or for her to be sexually inactive and labelled a "man-hater" or "uptight". This absence of choice permeates so thoroughly into women's day-to-day life that even small things like how they choose to dress or talk are criticized. Frye acknowledges that men face issues as well, but differentiates the issues of men and women through the metaphor of a bird cage. Each individual bind women face can be thought of as a single bar in a cage: by itself, it isn't enough to contain the bird. But, with enough bars, the bird is trapped inside the cage, left with nowhere to go. This is the complete absence of choice Frye describes: how it is the culmination of issues women face that is so "immobilizing" and why their struggle, and not men's, is considered [[oppression]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Feminist Frontiers|last=Frye|first=Marilyn|publisher=|year=2007|isbn=|edition=7th|location=|pages=7–9|chapter=Oppression}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Frye is openly [[lesbian]],&lt;ref&gt;''[[Willful Virgin: Essays in Feminism, 1976-1992]]'' (1992)&lt;/ref&gt; and much of her work explores social categories—in particular, those based on [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]] and [[gender]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cal.msu.edu/departments/Frye.php MSU Philosopher Marilyn Frye Wins Romanell-Phi Beta Kappa Professorship] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070815162502/http://www.cal.msu.edu/departments/Frye.php |date=2007-08-15 }} accessed June 21, (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Cutbank&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cutbank|first=Kid|title=Book Review: Frye's Politics of Reality|journal=[http://kidcutbank.blogspot.com/2012/05/book-review-politics-of-reality-by.html KidCutbank] Blog|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Card&gt;{{cite journal|last=Card|first=Claudia|title=Oppression and Resistance: Frye's Politics of Reality|journal=Hypatia|year=1986|volume=1|issue=1|pages=149–166|doi=10.1111/j.1527-2001.1986.tb00526.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Maxakalían''' languages (also '''Mashakalían''') were first classified into the [[Gê languages]]. It was only in 1931 that Loukotka separated them from the Gê family. Alfred Métraux and Curt Nimuendaju Unkel considered the Maxakalían family isolated from others. [[John Alden Mason]] suggests a connection with the [[Macro-Gê]] stock, confirmed by Aryon Dall’Igna Rodrigues.

==Languages==
Apart from extinct varieties generally seen as dialects of Maxakalí,&lt;ref&gt;Some listed as alternative names in {{ethnolink|mbl|Maxakali language}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mason noted resemblances with a few other extinct languages of the area: [[Pataxó language|Pataxó]], [[Malalí language|Malalí]] and [[Coropó language|Coropó]]. However, Coropó is now thought to be a [[Purian languages|Purian]] language. Campbell (1997) therefore lists the Maxakalian languages as:

# '''[[Malalí language|Malalí]]''' ''(†)''
# '''[[Pataxó language|Pataxó]]''' (Patashó) ''(†)'' (retain some words)
# '''[[Maxakalí language|Maxakalí]]''' (Mashacalí)

''Glottolog'' (2016) restores [[Coropó language|Coropó]] (Koropó) as a Maxakalían language.

The alveolar nasal {{IPA|/n/}} is [[Homorganic consonants|assimilated]] to following [[obstruent]]s; it can be labiodental (e.g. {{lang|el|αμφιβολία}} {{IPA|[aɱfivoˈlia]}} 'doubt'), dental (e.g. {{lang|el|άνθος}} {{IPA|[ˈan̪θos]}} 'flower'), [[Relative articulation#Advanced and retracted|retracted]] alveolar (e.g. {{lang|el|πένσα}} {{IPA|[ˈpen̠sa]}} "pliers"), [[alveolo-palatal]] (e.g. {{lang|el|συγχύζω}} {{IPA|[siɲˈçizo]}} 'to annoy'), or velar (e.g. {{lang|el|άγχος}} {{IPA|[ˈaŋхos]}} 'stress').{{sfn|Arvaniti|2007|pp=14–15}}

Voiceless stops are [[aspirated consonant|unaspirated]] and with a very short [[voice onset time]].{{sfn|Arvaniti|1999|p=2}} They may be lightly voiced in rapid speech, especially when [[intervocalic consonant|intervocalic]].{{sfn|Arvaniti|2007|p=7}} {{IPA|/t/}}'s exact [[place of articulation]] ranges from [[alveolar]] to [[denti-alveolar]], to [[dental consonant|dental]].{{sfn|Arvaniti|2007|p=10}} It may be fricated {{IPA|[{{IPA link|θ̠}} ~ {{IPA link|θ}}]}} in rapid speech, and very rarely, in [[function word]]s, it is deleted.{{sfn|Arvaniti|2007|p=11}} {{IPA|/p/}} and {{IPA|/k/}} are reduced to lesser degrees in rapid speech.{{sfn|Arvaniti|2007|p=11}}

Voiced stops are [[prenasalised]] as reflected in the orthography to varying extents, or not at all.{{sfn|Arvaniti|2007|p=9}} The nasal component—when present—does not increase the duration of the stop's closure; as such, prenasalised voiced stops would be most accurately transcribed {{IPA|[ᵐb ⁿd ᵑɡ]}} or {{IPA|[m͡b, n͡d, ŋ͡ɡ]}}, depending on the length of the nasal component.{{sfn|Arvaniti|2007|p=9}} Word-initially and after {{IPA|/r/}} or {{IPA|/l/}}, they are very rarely, if ever, prenasalised.{{sfn|Arvaniti|1999|p=2}}{{sfn|Arvaniti|2007|p=10}} In rapid and casual speech, prenasalisation is generally rarer, and voiced stops may be lenited to fricatives.{{sfn|Arvaniti|2007|p=10}} This also accounts for Greeks having trouble disambiguating voiced stops, nasalised voiced stops, and nasalised voiceless stops in borrowings and names from foreign languages; for example, ''d'', ''nd'', and ''nt'', which are all written ντ in Greek.

{{IPA|/s/}} and {{IPA|/z/}} are somewhat [[Relative articulation#Advanced and retracted|retracted]] ({{IPA|[s̠, z̠]}}); they are produced in between [[English language|English]] alveolars {{IPA|/s, z/}} and [[postalveolar]]s {{IPA|/ʃ, ʒ/}}.{{sfn|Arvaniti|2007|p=12}} {{IPA|/s/}} is variably fronted or further retracted depending on environment, and, in some cases, it may be better described as an advanced postalveolar ({{IPA|[ʃ˖]}}).{{sfn|Arvaniti|2007|p=12}}

The only Greek rhotic {{IPA|/r/}} is prototypically an alveolar tap {{IPAblink|ɾ}}, often retracted ({{IPA|[ɾ̠]}}). It may be an [[alveolar approximant]] {{IPAblink|ɹ}} intervocalically, and is usually a [[alveolar trill|trill]] {{IPAblink|r}} in clusters, with two or three short cycles.{{sfn|Arvaniti|2007|p=15}}

Greek has palatals {{IPA|[{{IPA link|c̠|c}}, {{IPA link|ɟ˗|ɟ}}, {{IPA link|ç˗|ç}}, {{IPA link|ʝ˗|ʝ}}]}} that contrast with velars {{IPA|[{{IPA link|k}}, {{IPA link|ɡ}}, {{IPA link|x}}, {{IPA link|ɣ}}]}} before {{IPA|/a, o, u/}}, but in [[complementary distribution]] with velars before front vowels {{IPA|/e, i/}}.{{sfn|Arvaniti|2007|p=19}} {{IPAblink|ʎ}} and {{IPAblink|ɲ}} occur as allophones of {{IPA|/l/}} and {{IPA|/n/}}, respectively, in &lt;tt&gt;CJV&lt;/tt&gt; (consonant–glide–vowel) clusters, in analyses that posit an [[archiphoneme]]-like [[semivowel|glide]] &lt;tt&gt;/J/&lt;/tt&gt; that contrasts with the vowel {{IPA|/i/}}.{{sfn|Baltazani|Topinzi|2013|p=23}} All palatals may be analysed in the same way. The palatal stops and fricatives are somewhat retracted, and {{IPAblink|ʎ}} and {{IPAblink|ɲ}} are somewhat fronted. {{IPAblink|ʎ}} is best described as a postalveolar, and {{IPAblink|ɲ}} as [[alveolo-palatal nasal|alveolo-palatal]].{{sfn|Arvaniti|2007|p=19–20}}

Finally, Greek has two phonetically affricate [[consonant cluster|clusters]], {{IPAblink|t͡s}} and {{IPAblink|d͡z}}.{{sfn|Arvaniti|2007|pp=20, 23}} {{harvtxt|Arvaniti|2007}} is reluctant to treat these as phonemes on the grounds of inconclusive research into their phonological behaviour.{{sfn|Arvaniti|2007|p=24}}

===Sandhi===
Some [[assimilation (linguistics)|assimilatory]] processes mentioned above also occur across word boundaries. In particular, this goes for a number of grammatical words ending in {{IPA|/n/}}, most notably the negation particles {{lang|el|δεν}} and {{lang|el|μην}} and the [[Accusative case|accusative]] forms of the personal pronoun and definite article {{lang|el|τον}} and {{lang|el|την}}. If these words are followed by a voiceless stop, {{IPA|/n/}} either assimilates for place of articulation to the stop, or is altogether deleted, and the stop becomes voiced. This results in pronunciations such as {{lang|el|τον πατέρα}} {{IPA|[to(m)baˈtera]}} ('the father' &lt;small&gt;ACC&lt;/small&gt;) or {{lang|el|δεν πειράζει}} {{IPA|[ðe(m)biˈrazi]}} ('it doesn't matter'), instead of {{IPA|*[ton paˈtera]}} and {{IPA|*[ðen piˈrazi]}}. The precise extent of assimilation may vary according to dialect, speed and formality of speech.{{sfn|Joseph|Philippaki-Warburton|1987|p=246}}

==Vowels==
[[Image:Standard Modern Greek vowel chart.svg|thumb|upright=1.13|The vowels of Standard Modern Greek on a [[vowel chart]]. Adapted from {{harvtxt|Arvaniti|2007|p=28}}.]]

Greek has a simple system of five vowels {{IPA|/i, u, e, o, a/}}:{{sfn|Arvaniti|2007|p=25}}{{sfn|Lodge|2009|p=89}}{{sfn|Trudgill|2009|p=81}}
* The closed vowels {{IPA|/i, u/}} have qualities approaching their respective [[cardinal vowels]].{{sfn|Lodge|2009|p=89}}{{sfn|Trudgill|2009|p=81}}{{sfn|Arvaniti|2007|pp=25, 28}}
* The mid vowels {{IPA|/e, o/}} are [[Mid vowel|true-mid]] {{IPA|[{{IPA link|e̞}}, {{IPA link|o̞}}]}}.{{sfn|Lodge|2009|p=89}}{{sfn|Trudgill|2009|p=81}}{{sfn|Arvaniti|2007|p=28}}
* The open vowel {{IPA|/a/}} has been described variously as near-open central {{IPAblink|ɐ}}{{sfn|Lodge|2009|p=89}}{{sfn|Arvaniti|2007|pp=25, 28}} and open central {{IPAblink|ä}}.{{sfn|Trudgill|2009|p=81}}

There is no phonemic length distinction, but vowels in stressed syllables are pronounced somewhat longer {{IPA|[iˑ, uˑ, eˑ, oˑ, aˑ]}} than in unstressed syllables. Furthermore, vowels in stressed syllables are more peripheral, but the difference is not large. In casual speech, unstressed {{IPA|/i/}} and {{IPA|/u/}} in the vicinity of voiceless consonants may become devoiced or even elided.{{sfn|Arvaniti|1999|pp=3, 5}}

==Stress==
Unlike [[Ancient Greek]], which had a [[pitch accent]] system, Modern Greek has variable (phonologically unpredictable) [[stress (linguistics)|stress]]. Every multisyllabic word carries stress on one of its three final syllables. [[Enclitic]]s form a single [[phonological word]] together with the host word to which they attach, and count towards the three-syllable rule too. In these cases, primary stress shifts to the second-to-last syllable (e.g. {{lang|el|αυτοκίνητό μου}} {{IPA|[aftoˌciniˈto mu]}} 'my car'). Phonetically, stressed syllables are longer and/or carry higher amplitude.{{sfn|Arvaniti|1999|p=5}}

The position of the stress can vary between different inflectional forms of the same word within its inflectional paradigm. In some paradigms, the stress is always on the third last syllable, shifting its position in those forms that have longer affixes (e.g. {{lang|el|κάλεσα}} 'I called' vs. {{lang|el|καλέσαμε}} 'we called'; {{lang|el|πρόβλημα}} 'problem' vs. {{lang|el|προβλήματα}} 'problems'). In some word classes, stress position also preserves an older pattern inherited from [[Ancient Greek]], according to which a word could not be accented on the third-from-last syllable if the [[ultima (linguistics)|last syllable]] was long, e.g. {{lang|el|άνθρωπος}} ('man', [[nominative|nom.]] [[Grammatical number|sg.]], last syllable short), but {{lang|el|ανθρώπων}} ('of men', [[genitive case|gen.]] [[plural|pl.]], last syllable long). However, in Modern Greek this rule is no longer automatic and does not apply to all words (e.g. {{lang|el|καλόγερος}} 'monk', {{lang|el|καλόγερων}} 'of monks'), as the phonological length distinction itself no longer exists.{{sfn|Holton|Mackridge|Philippaki-Warburton|1998|pp=25–27, 53–54}}

      <comment>I clarified the claim that Nenets has 16 moods by summarizing a bit of the citation given - if you are used to thinking of moods as being as distinct in their use as "is" vs "be!" vs "would be," then having 16 moods seems like a pretty radical thing, but really what is going on here is "is" vs "definitely is" vs "probably is" vs "seems to be."  I also narrowed the claim to Tundra Nenets, because the citation only mentions Tundra and the number doesn't seem likely to be the same for both.</comment>

'''Nenets''' (in former work also '''Yurak''') is a pair of closely related languages spoken in northern [[Russia]] by the [[Nenets people]]. They are often treated as being two [[dialect]]s of the same language, but they are very different and [[mutual intelligibility]] is low. The languages are [[Tundra Nenets language|Tundra Nenets]], the bigger language of the two in number of speakers, spoken by some 30,000 to 40,000 people&lt;ref name="ethnologue"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=yrk|title=Nenets|author=|date=|website=ethnologue.com|accessdate=20 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="brown2006"&gt;{{cite book | author = [[Tapani Salminen|Salminen, Tapani]], [[Farrell Ackerman|Ackerman, Farrell]] | editor = [[Keith Brown (linguist)|Brown, Keith]] | year = 2006 | pages = 577–579 | chapter = Nenets | title = Encyclopedia of Languages &amp; Linguistics | edition = 2 | volume = 8 | publisher = [[Elsevier]] | location = [[Oxford]], [[England]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; in an area stretching from the [[Kanin Peninsula]] to the [[Yenisei River]];&lt;ref name="staroverov2006"&gt;{{cite book | author = [[Peter Staroverov|Staroverov, Peter]] | location = [[Moscow]], [[Russia]] | year = 2006 | title = Vowel deletion and stress in Tundra Nenets | page = 1}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Forest Nenets language|Forest Nenets]], spoken by 1,000 to 1,500 people around the [[Agan River|Agan]], [[Pur River (Russia)|Pur]], [[Lyamin River|Lyamin]] and [[Nadym River|Nadym rivers]].&lt;ref name="ethnologue" /&gt;&lt;ref name="brown2006" /&gt;

The Nenets languages are classified in the [[Uralic languages|Uralic language family]], making them distantly related to some national languages spoken in Europe – namely [[Finnish language|Finnish]], [[Estonian language|Estonian]], and [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] – in addition to other minority languages spoken in Russia. Both of the Nenets languages have been greatly influenced by [[Russian language|Russian]]. [[Tundra Nenets language|Tundra Nenets]] has, to a lesser degree, been influenced by [[Komi language|Komi]], and [[Khanty language|Northern Khanty]]. [[Forest Nenets language|Forest Nenets]] has also been influenced by [[Khanty language|Eastern Khanty]]. Tundra Nenets is well documented, considering its status as an [[indigenous language|indigenous]] and [[minority language]], also having a literary tradition going back to the 1930s, while Forest Nenets was first written during the 1990s and is only very little documented.&lt;ref name="brown2006" /&gt;

Apart from the word 'Nenets', only one other Nenets word has entered the [[English language]]: '[[parka]]', their traditional long hooded jacket made from skins and sometimes fur.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/parka "parka" in ''Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="games2007"&gt;{{Cite book | author = [[Alex Games|Games, Alex]] | year = 2007 | title = Balderdash &amp; Piffle: One Sandwich Short of a Dog's Dinner | isbn = 978-1-84607-235-2 | publisher = [[BBC]] | location = [[London]]}}{{Verify credibility|date=January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Common features of Nenets languages ==
Tundra Nenets has 16 [[Grammatical mood|moods]], most of which reflect different degrees of certainty in what in English might be called [[Realis mood|indicative]] statements or different degrees of force in what in English might be called [[Imperative mood|imperative]] commands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.helsinki.fi/~tasalmin/sketch.html|title=Tundra Nenets grammatical sketch|author=|date=|website=www.helsinki.fi|accessdate=20 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  An overarching feature of the Nenets languages is the introduction of systematic [[Palatalization (phonetics)|palatalization]] of almost all consonants. This originates from contrasts between different vowel qualities in the [[Proto-Samoyedic]] language.&lt;ref name = "Sml88"&gt;{{citation

The [[velar consonant]]s *k and *ŋ were additionally shifted to *sʲ and *nʲ when palatalized.

Similar changes have also occurred in the other Samoyedic languages spoken in the tundra zone: [[Enets language|Enets]], [[Nganasan language|Nganasan]] and the extinct [[Yurats language|Yurats]].

== Differences between Tundra and Forest Nenets ==

Tundra Nenets generally has remained closer to Proto-Nenets than Forest Nenets, whose phonology has been influenced by eastern [[Khanty language|Khanty]] dialects. Changes towards the modern languages include:&lt;ref name="SalmNotes"&gt;{{citation

'''Newspaper formats''' vary substantially, with different formats more common in different countries. The size of a newspaper format refers to the [[paper size|size of the paper page]]; the printed area within that can vary substantially depending on the newspaper.

In some countries, particular formats have associations with particular types of newspaper; for example, in the [[United Kingdom]], there is a distinction between "tabloid" and "broadsheet" as references to newspaper content quality, which originates with the more popular newspapers using the tabloid format; hence "[[tabloid journalism]]".

==Trends==

In extreme examples, some broadsheet papers are nearly as narrow as traditional tabloids.
An average roll of {{convert|26.4|lb|kg|abbr=on}}, {{convert|45|in|cm|abbr=on}} diameter newsprint rolled out is {{convert|9.7|mi|km|abbr=on}} long.

'''Nguồn''' (also '''Năm Nguyên''') is a [[Vietic]] language spoken by the [[Nguồn people]] in the [[Annamite Range|Trường Sơn mountains]] in [[Vietnam]]'s [[North Central Coast]] region as well as in nearby regions of [[Laos]].

Most Nguồn speakers in Vietnam live in the secluded [[Minh Hoa|Minh Hóa]] district of [[Quảng Bình Province]], with others in the area around [[Đồng Lê]]&lt;!--Is this a town or commune?--&gt;, the seat of [[Tuyên Hoá District]], approximately {{convert|50|km|mi|abbr=on}} from the [[National Road 1A (Vietnam)|National Highway 1]].

The Nguồn language has been variously described as a dialect of [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]] or as the southernmost dialect of [[Muong language|Mường]]. Some researchers who consider it more closely related to Mường find that those who connect it more closely with Vietnamese are more influenced by [[ethnographic]] and/or political concerns than linguistic evidence. Chamberlain (2003) and Sidwell (2009) count it as a third Viet–Muong language.

==Geographic location==
Most Nguồn live in [[Tuyên Hóa District]] (alongside the neighboring [[Sách people]], a subgroup of the [[Chut people|Chứt people]] who also speak a Vietic language) and in [[Minh Hoá District]] (living with the neighboring [[Vietnamese people|Việt]] peoples).&lt;ref&gt;Note the current Tuyên Hoá and Minh Hoá districts once comprised a single district known as Tuyên Hoá.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also Nguồn living in [[Laos]], but with conflicting reports as to their exact location.&lt;ref&gt;See the Christian missionary site: [http://www.millionelephants.com/UPGs/nguon.htm Nguon people group of Laos].&lt;/ref&gt; According to Chamberlain (1998), there is a Nguồn village in central Laos known as Ban Pak Phanang in Boualapha District, [[Khammouane Province]].&lt;ref name="Chamberlain"&gt;Chamberlain, J.R. 1998, "[http://sealang.net/sala/archives/pdf8/chamberlain1998origin.pdf The origin of Sek: implications for Tai and Vietnamese history]", in The International Conference on Tai Studies, ed. S. Burusphat, Bangkok, Thailand, pp. 97-128. Institute of Language and Culture for Rural Development, Mahidol University.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Genealogical relations==

Chéon (1907), Maspéro (1912), and Cuisinier (1948) considered Nguồn to be more closely related to Mường while Mạc (1964), Nguyễn Đ. B. (1975), and Phạm (1975) connected it with Vietnamese.

Later linguistic comparison by Nguyễn V. T. (1975) and Nguyễn Ph. Ph. (1996) suggest a closer link with the Mường dialects, and this is echoed by Barker (1993) (and others).

Jerold A. Edmondson, Kenneth J. Gregerson, and Nguyen Van Loi mention that this language is of "great interest to those studying the history of Vietic languages" due to its distinct historical developments.&lt;ref&gt;See their page on Lesser Known Languages of Northern Vietnam: [http://ling.uta.edu/~jerry/research/ ling.uta.edu/~jerry/research/].&lt;/ref&gt;

Nguyễn V. T. (1975) notes that Nguồn speakers can communicate with Mường speakers with each speaking their own language, but Vietnamese speakers who do not know Mường cannot understand Nguồn.

Although closer to Mường generally (especially concerning sound system similarities), in some aspects Nguồn is more similar to Vietnamese. For example, the negative marker in Vietnamese is the particle ''không'', which is ultimately a loanword from Chinese that became [[grammaticalization|grammaticalized]]. The native negative marker ''chẳng'', which is attested in earlier stages of Vietnamese, was largely replaced by the Chinese borrowing.&lt;ref name="Alves"&gt;{{cite journal

|hdl=1885/8939}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mường, in contrast, has preserved the original ''chẳng''. Nguồn has, like Vietnamese, lost ''chẳng'' to ''không''. In this feature of the loss of the native negative marker, Nguồn is like Vietnamese rather than Mường.

==Language variation==
Nguyễn Ph. Ph. (1996) notes that there are two [[variety (linguistics)|varieties]] of Nguồn:

* Cổ Liêm
* Yên Thọ (or An Thọ)

Cổ Liêm is named after the village of the same name; Yên Thọ is the name of a cooperative in Tân Hoá village.

The Yên Thọ variety is closer to Vietnamese than Cổ Liêm with respect to certain [[phonological]] developments.

==History==

{{Expand section|date=May 2008}}

In 1905, Cadière&lt;ref&gt;The original French source is quoted in Nguyễn Ph. Ph. (1996).&lt;/ref&gt; reported that the Nguồn (as well as the [[Sach people|Sách]] people) were to be found in valleys of the [[Nguồn Năn]] river in eleven villages.&lt;ref&gt;See the following satellite link from SatelliteViews.net: [http://www.satelliteviews.net/cgi-bin/w.cgi?c=vm&amp;UF=-3723056&amp;UN=-4948367&amp;AF=H_N Nguồn Năn, Vietnam].&lt;/ref&gt; Originally there were two groups of five villages. The northern group was in Cơ Sa ''canton''&lt;!--the term "canton" is from the French source perhaps a better translation?--&gt; (along with some Việt villages) and consisted of the following villages:

* ''Qui Đạt''
* ''An Đức''
* ''Ba Nương''
* ''Thanh Long''
* ''Tân Kiều''

Tân Kiều was later split into two villages resulting in a sixth village in the northern group:

* ''Tân Hợp''

The more southerly village group consisted of

* ''Kổ Liêm''
* ''Bốk Thọ''
* ''Kim Bãng''
* ''Tân Lí''
* ''An Lạk''

Mạc (1964) and Nguyễn Đ. B. (1975) assert that Nguồn is an original Việt group from the area of the [[Hà Tĩnh Province|Hà Tĩnh]] and [[Nghệ An Province|Nghệ An]] provinces who moved into their present territory by the 17th century. Evidence for this opinion is based on family records. Mạc (1964) also reports that most Nguồn declared themselves to be Việt on the 1960 census.

Nguyễn V. T. (1975) suggests that the Mường could have migrated further south than Nghệ An to as far as Quảng Bình. Although some Việt families may have migrated to this region, they may have done so after Mường groups had already been established in the area. These Việt migrants could, then, have assimilated in language to the Mường. This Mường variety also would have been in contact with [[Chứt]] languages, like Sách. Thus, Nguyễn V. T. (1975) suggests that Nguồn is a variety of Mường spoken by Mường (possibly Hà Tĩnh Mường) and assimilated Việt people with influences from Chứt languages.&lt;ref&gt;In particular, see Nguyễn V. T. (1993: 242-243).&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Rahmonberdi Madazimov''' ({{lang-ru|link=no|Рахмонберди Мадазимов}}) (1875–1933) – founder and organizer of the theatrical movement in [[Kyrgyzstan]], the founder and first artistic director of the [[Osh State Academic Uzbek Music and Drama Theater named after Babur]] [[Osh]] city, writer.

==Biography==
'''Mirzo Rahmonberdi hajji''' son Muhammadazim alam (Madazimov) was born in 1875 in the town of [[Uzgen]]. Rahmonberdi [[hajji]] Madazimov was a writer, in 1914–1915 in the printing house at the chancellery by the [[Governor-general]] of [[Turkestan]] in [[Tashkent]] were published of his two books "Osh characteristics", "Dictionary of names".

In 1914, the [[Osh State Academic Uzbek Music and Drama Theater named after Babur|theater group]] was founded under the leadership of Rahmonberdi Madazimov with teacher Russian-native schools [[Osh]] city Baltyhodzha Sultanov

In 1918, under the leadership of Rahmonberdi Madazimov with other enlightened leaders and teachers of the [[Osh]] district Ibrohim Musaboev, Beknazar Nazarov, Zhurahon Zaynobiddinov, Nazirhan Kamolov, A.Saidov, A.Eshonhonov, Abdukodir Iskhokov, Isroiljon Ismoilov, Jalil Sobitov the first time in [[Kyrgyzstan]] was founded by amateur [[Osh State Academic Uzbek Music and Drama Theater named after Babur|theater group]] based on the concert brigade at the [[Revolutionary Military Council]] of the [[Turkestan Front]] of the local [[muslim]] actors

The first artistic director of the [[Osh State Academic Uzbek Music and Drama Theater named after Babur|theater group]] Rahmonberdi Madazimov was the first founder and organizer of the theater movement in [[Kyrgyzstan]]. In 1919, a circle was formed in the [[Osh State Academic Uzbek Music and Drama Theater named after Babur|drama troupe]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15605">In linguistics, a '''resultative''' ([[list of glossing abbreviations|abbreviated]] '''{{sc|res}}''') is a form that expresses that something or someone has undergone a change in state as the result of the completion of an event. Resultatives appear as [[Predicate (grammar)|predicates]] of sentences, and are generally composed of a 
[[verb]] (denoting the event) a postverbal [[noun phrase]] (denoting the entity that has undergone a change) and a so-called resultative phrase (denoting the state achieved as the result of the action named by the verb&lt;ref&gt;Levin, Beth. (1993). English verb classes and alternations. Chicago: University of Chicago
Press.&lt;/ref&gt;) which may be represented by an [[adjective]], a [[prepositional phrase]], or a [[grammatical particle|particle]], among others.&lt;ref name="goldberg"&gt;Goldberg, A. E. &amp; Jackendoff, R. (2004). The English Resultative as a Family of Constructions. Language, 80, 532-568.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in the English sentence ''The man wiped the table clean'', the adjective ''clean'' denotes the state achieved by ''the table'' as a result of the event described as ''the man wiped''.

== Resultative constructions ==
Resultative constructions are set syntactic patterns used to express resultativeness. Within these structures, the object NP is viewed as having undergone some change of state, and the change is viewed as a result achieved through the action expressed by the combination of the verb and the result phrase. The word order of the elements is said to be constant and crucial in conveying the resultative meaning; under this analysis, the output in its entirety is regarded as having a more complex meaning than the sum of its components' individual meanings. This constructional approach has been proposed in order to account for the semantic differences between standalone verbs that have no intrinsic resultative meaning and their resultative counterparts (e.g. ''hammer'' versus ''hammer flat'').&lt;ref name="gorlach" /&gt;

=== Systems of differentiation ===
[[File:Syntactic_Trees_Resultative.png|thumb|right|Syntactic trees showing the difference in structure between resultative and non-resultative phrases.]]

Resultative constructions can be described in the framework of a sign-oriented approach: morphological signals and word order signals (based on the ordering of lexical items) interact in order to create meaning. This interaction generates a system of oppositions based on two types of differentiation: differentiation of the referent from other referents in the lexicon and differentiation of the referent from itself.&lt;ref name="diver" /&gt;

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Differentiation from Other !! Differentiation from Self
|-
| He painted the red barn. || He painted the barn red.
|-
| She wore her long hair. || She wore her hair long.
|-
| He found the guilty man. || He found the man guilty.
|-
| He made the sacred porridge. || He made the porridge sacred.
|}

=== Classes of resultative constructions ===
Semantically, resultative constructions can be part of one of four major classes: causative, non-causative, property or path resultatives. These classes are distinguished by the relation between the noun phrase undergoing the change expressed by the resultative (referred to as the host) and the resultative construction itself.&lt;ref name="goldberg" /&gt;

In causative resultatives, the host is the [[direct object]] of the resultative construction; the [[subject (grammar)|subject]] causes the host to undergo a change. In noncausative resultatives, the host is the subject of the resultative construction; the sentence states a change of state or position.

In property resultatives, the host comes to have the property expressed by the resultative construction. In path resultatives, the resultative construction describes a path that is traversed by the host.

{| class="wikitable"
|-
!  !! Causative !! Noncausative
|-
| ''Property'' || '''The gardener''' watered '''the tulips''' ''flat'' || '''The lake''' froze ''solid''
|-
| ''Path'' || '''Bill''' rolled '''the ball''' ''down the hill'' || '''The ball''' rolled ''down the hill''
|}

==Traditional view==

Defining the role and category of resultatives has inspired numerous approaches from linguists. Traditionally, certain tenses and aspects have been attributed to resultatives. Namely, the [[present perfect]] aspect is pointed to in explaining resultative constructions like ''I have written them a letter''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Depraetere|first=Ilse|title=On the resultative character of present perfect sentences|year=1998|publisher=Journal of Pragmatics 29, 5 (1998) 608 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a stress on the sense of completeness inherent in resultatives:  A: Have you cleaned the windows?  B: No, I haven't finished them yet.
B* Yes, but I haven't finished them yet

In this example, answering negatively entails that either some or none of the windows have been cleaned, but you cannot answer positively unless the entire task is completed. The task does not require successful completion as found in the example ''He has not passed his exam''.

It has been demonstrated, however, that resultatives exist independently of the perfect in sentences like ''I turned this offer down'', creating the need to reexamine the role of resultatives.&lt;ref name="gorlach" /&gt; To address this, it has been claimed that the resultative expresses both a state and the preceding action it has resulted from.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Nedjalkov|first=Vladimir|title=Typology of Resultative Constructions|year=1988|publisher=Amsterdam; Philadelphia: John Benjamins Publishing Company. (English translation edited by Bernard Comrie.)}}&lt;/ref&gt; This emphasizes that the resultative describes how a state was acted upon. Therefore, it must use the [[passive voice|passive form]]. However, this analysis does not account for phrases such as ''I turned this offer down'', which uses the [[active voice|active]] rather than the passive voice.

==Sign-oriented analysis==

Sign-oriented analyses present an aspectual contrast, in which the approach is based on the boundaries of [[predicate (grammar)|predication]] within a time-field.&lt;ref name="diver"&gt;{{cite book|last=Diver|first=W.|title=The Grammar of Modern English|year=1986|publisher=Columbia University|location=ms}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Huffman|first=A.|title=Teaching the English tenses|journal=Columbia University Working Papers in Linguistics|volume=10, i-iv, 1-153, xvi-xxi}}&lt;/ref&gt; An action is perceived as a whole within a predication or it could be perceived as the predication within the boundaries.&lt;ref name="gorlach"&gt;{{cite book|last=Gorlach|first=Marina|title=Phrasal constructions and resultativeness in English : a sign-oriented analysis|year=2004|publisher=J. Benjamins|location=Amsterdam|isbn=9027215618|page=54}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
A markedness relationship is one between the [[perfective]] and [[imperfective]].&lt;ref name="RL Allen 1966"&gt;{{cite book|last=Allen|first=R. L.|title=The Verb System of Present-Day English.|year=1966|publisher=The Hague|location=Mouton}}&lt;/ref&gt; This analysis argues against the view that the resultative meaning is identical to the perfect. Below are sentences where the verbs in the perfect do not have the ‘element of result’ in their meaning:

''I’ve seen it before.''
''It’s only been three or four times that we’ve come face to face.''

In the sentences above ‘the element of result’ does not seem apparent. It is argued that the concrete result and the result phase should be distinguished from each other.&lt;ref name="RL Allen 1966"/&gt;

===The Guillaumean approach===
This aspectual approach shows the relation between an action and its result. The Guillaumean approach posits that the English verb has two moments, one where any duration, any developments, or any actualizations take place with the event’s duration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hirtle|first=W|title=Time, Aspect and the Verb.|year=1975|publisher=Les Presses de l'Universite Laval|location=Quebec}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{| class="wikitable"
|+The Guillaumean Chart of notational chronology
|-
! before !! after
|-
| cause || effect
|-
| condition || consequence
|-
| operation || result 
|}

===The resultative as a feature of English===
Yet another approach to resultativeness views it as “a fundamental semantic distinctive feature which cuts across almost all traditional categories: [[verb]], [[noun]], [[adjective]], [[infinitive]], [[gerund]], [[participle]], [[particle]], [[auxiliary verb|auxiliary]]”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Tobin|first=Y.|title=Aspect in the English Verb: Process and Result in Language|year=1993|publisher=Longman|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is claimed that the resultative should be a distinctive feature in language instead of being a subcategory within the verbal aspect realm.

==As a system of oppositions==
[[File:Result-based_oppositions.png|thumb|left|Result-based oppositions in the lexicon]]
This approach suggests the idea of viewing resultativeness as a system of oppositions. It hypothesizes that the resultative is not restricted to a tense or an aspect form.&lt;ref name="gorlach" /&gt; It suggests that the resultativeness is expressed by oppositions of marked/unmarked forms throughout all language levels and subsystems.&lt;ref name="gorlach" /&gt; [[Markedness]] is a system that contrasts two language forms as distinguished based on simplicity and frequency of usage.(For example, irregular verbs will be marked, whereas regular verbs will be unmarked)

These [[List of language subsystems|subsystems]] includes: [[morpheme]], [[auxiliaries]], lexical pairs, [[Compound (linguistics)|compounds]], verb complements, tense aspect and voice forms, syntactic patters, types of sentences, [[word order]], [[Stress (linguistics)|stress]], and [[Intonation (linguistics)|intonation]].&lt;ref name="gorlach" /&gt;

Gorlach, in her book, proposes that resultativeness happens depending whether the subsystem is marked or not. For example, in the sentence "I am wip'''ing''' the table" the affix '''-ing''' is unmarked and expresses neutral state instead of resultative state. '''-ed''', on the other hand, is unmarked form of affix, thus making the following sentence express resultativeness: "I wip'''ed''' the table".&lt;ref name="gorlach" /&gt;

Extended list of marked/unmarked form of all language subsystems can be found in the table.

==Distribution==

A resultative is either an adjectival phrase indicating the state of a [[noun]] resulting from the completion of the event denoted by the [[verb]], or a verbal construction denoting the result state of an event. This verbal construction type of resultative is usually considered part of the field of [[Grammatical aspect|aspect]].

===Adjectival resultatives===

This type of resultative is a phrase that indicates the state of a [[noun]] resulting from the completion of the [[verb]].  In the English examples below, the affected noun is shown in '''bold''' and the resulting predicate is in ''italics'':

*John licked '''his plate''' ''clean''.
*Mary painted '''the fence''' ''blue''.
*The cold weather froze '''the lake''' ''solid''.

Subjects of [[passive voice|passive]] and [[unaccusative verb]]s may participate in resultative constructions:

*'''Passive''':  '''The well''' was drained ''dry''.
*'''Unaccusative''':  '''The door''' swung ''open''.

Subjects of [[unergative verb]]s may also participate in resultative constructions, but a "dummy object", that is, an otherwise absent [[reflexive pronoun]] must be inserted:

*'''Gordon''' laughed '''himself''' ''helpless''.
*'''The girl''' screamed '''herself''' ''hoarse''.

Resultatives are distinct from depictive constructions, though often both a resultative and a depictive reading is possible from the same sentence.  For example, in "John fried the fish dry", a resultative reading suggests that as a result of John's frying, the fish became dry.  On the other hand, also possible is a depictive reading in which John is already dry, and that is the state in which he is frying the fish (because e.g. he had been back from the beach for long enough to be dry).  Both depictives and resultatives are important in the understanding of small clauses because their exact properties seem to vary considerably from language to language.

====Resultatives in German====

In German, some verbs can occur in adjectival resultative sentences while others cannot. In the example below, an argument can be made that the noun phrase after the verb can be interpreted as a verb argument.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Richter|first=Michael|author2=van Hout, Roeland|title=Why some verbs can form a resultative construction while others cannot: Decomposing semantic binding|journal=Lingua|date=August 2010|volume=120|issue=8|pages=2006–2021|doi=10.1016/j.lingua.2010.02.007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:{{interlinear|lang = de
|Der Schmied hämmert das Metall flach.
|'The smith hammers the metal flat.'|}}

===Verbal resultatives===

This sort of resultative is a grammatical aspect construction that indicates the result state of the event denoted by the verb. English does not have a productive resultative construction. It is widely accepted that the ''be''-[[Perfect (grammar)|perfects]] of various European languages (e.g. French, Italian, German, and Dutch) began as resultative constructions.&lt;ref&gt;Bybee, J., Perkins, R &amp; Pagliuca, W. 1994. The Evolution of Grammar: Tense, Aspect, and Modality in the Languages of the World. Chicago; London: University of Chicago Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Resultatives in Mandarin====
Mandarin places the resultative within an verb aspect construction. 
:{{interlinear|lang = cmn
|top=张三擦干净了桌子。
|Zhāngsān cā-gānjìng-le zhuōzi.
|Zhangsan wipe-clean-PFV table
|'Zhangsan wiped the table clean.'}}

In this example, the resultative ''ganjing'' is situated within the verb aspect construction. The verb ''ca-'' takes the theta roles of agent and experiencer. Resultative phrases may also take multiple theta-roles. The linguist Fengqi Li calls these “composite roles”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite paper|last=Li|first=Fengqi.|title=Theta-Structures of Mandarin Resultative Verb Compounds|year=2011|publisher=Linguistik Online| url = http://www.linguistik-online.de/50_11/fengqi.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:{{interlinear|lang = cmn
|top=斧子砍钝了。
|Fǔzi kǎn-dùn-le
|Axe cut-dull-PFV
|'The axe became dull because of overuse.'}}

Here, the theta-roles are agent, experiencer and instrument. The experiencer and instrument are both the ax, but they take composite roles. The verb cut is transitive and therefore requires a direct object. The composite role allows the knife to undergo its own action.

====Resultatives in Japanese====

The resultative construction in English might be represented as SVO AP.
:a. ''John shot Mary dead.''
:b. ''John painted the wall blue.''

The Japanese translation of the sentences a. and b. in the above table would have two distinct constructions. The first construction has a complex verb strategy, where V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is the causative change of state verb, or result state corresponding to the AP in English construction. V&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is a verb of simple activity, which corresponds to V in the English construction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Washio|first=Ryuichi|title=Resultatives, Compositionality and Language Variation|journal=Journal of East Asian Linguistics|year=1997|volume=6|series=1|pages=1–49|jstor=20100710}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:{{interlinear|lang = ja
|top=ジョンがメアリーを撃ち殺した。
|Jon-ga Mearī-o uchi-koroshi-ta.

'''Se-tenant''' stamps or labels are printed from the same plate and sheet and adjoin one another, unsevered in a strip or block.  They differ from each other by  design, color, denomination or [[overprint]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Baadke | first = Michael | title = Se-tenant stamps: different designs together | work = Refresher Course | publisher = [[Linn's Stamp News]] | date = | url = http://www.linns.com/howto/refresher/setenants_19980601/refreshercourse.asp?uID= | accessdate = 2010-11-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They may have a continuous design. The word "se-tenant" translates from French as meaning "joined together"&lt;ref name=Bennett&gt;Bennett, Russell and James Watson. (1978) ''Philatelic Terms Illustrated''. London: [[Stanley Gibbons|Stanley Gibbons Publications]].&lt;/ref&gt; or "holding together".&lt;ref&gt;[[Adrian Room|Room, Adrian]]. (2000) ''Cassell's Foreign Words and Phrases''. London: [[Cassell (publisher)|Cassell &amp; Co.]], p. 329. {{ISBN|0304350087}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are differing ways of preparing a se-tenant sheet. One can have stamps of one design on half of the sheet and the second design on the other half.  In this case, the only se-tenants would be in the center where the two halves meet. A more frequent set-up is to have pairs of differing stamps throughout the sheet.  Sometimes when two different designs appear on a single pane, the stamps are arranged like a checkerboard, with the different designs alternating in each row and column horizontally and vertically. One can have a [[Triptych (philately)|triptych]], or a [[tête-bêche]] format (head to toe). Stamp booklets often contain se-tenant stamps or labels.

==United States stamps==
Four of the U. S. Postmasters' Provisional stamp issues distributed between 1845 and 1847 were se-tenant productions: the Baltimore Postmaster’s provisionals (two different images [5¢ and 10¢] on a sheet of twelve), the [[St. Louis Bears]] (three different images [5¢, 10¢ and 20¢] on a sheet of six), the [[:File:ProvRI.jpg|Providence R. I. provisionals]] (two different images [5¢ and 10¢] on a sheet of twelve) and the Alexandria Postmaster's Provisionals (a pair of not-quite-identical 5¢ images).  With the issuance of U. S. national postage stamps, which began in 1847, se-tenant production disappeared from the nation for 117 years, not introduced until the 1964 Christmas Issue, which presented images of holly, mistletoe, poinsettia and a conifer sprig in a block of four stamps. After 1967, the U. S. began offering se-tenant issues with some frequency.

The US has since printed as many as 50 different stamps on a single sheet, such as in the 50 state flags, birds and flowers.  Se-tenant stamps began as issues of separate designs that were simply attached to one another, but have developed to issues where the stamps are part of a larger continuous design.

Some grammatical aspects of Sherpa are as follows:
* Nouns are defined by morphology when a bare noun occurs in the genitive and this extends to the noun phrase. Defined by syntactic co-occurrence with the locative clitic, comes first in the noun phrase after demonstratives.
* Demonstratives are defined syntactically by first position in the NP directly before the noun.
* Quantifiers: Number words occur last in the noun phrase with the exception of the definite article.
* Adjectives occur after the noun in the NP and morphologically only take genitive marking when in construct with a noun.
* Verbs may morphologically be distinguished by differing or suppletive roots for the perfective, imperfective, and imperative.  They occur last in a clause before the verbal auxiliaries.
* Verbal Auxiliaries occur last in a clause.
* Postpositions occur last in a postpositional NP.
* Sherpa is a tone language &lt;ref&gt;https://www.ethnologue.com/language/xsr&lt;/ref&gt;

Other typological features: 1. Split Ergativity based on Aspect 2. SO &amp; OV (SOV) 3. N-A 4. N-Num 5. V-Aux 6. N-Pos

[[Image:Ouch-boxing-footwork.jpg|thumb|Punching combinations are an essential part of [[boxing]].]]

A '''striking combination''' (generally referred to as a '''combination''' or "'''combo'''") is a combination of [[strike (attack)|strikes]] performed in rapid succession, usually from a [[stand-up fighting|stand-up position]]. If the combination includes only [[punch (strike)|punches]], it is called a '''punching combination''', and if it includes only [[kick]]s, it is called a '''kicking combination'''.

Popular striking combinations consist of punches which allow the fighter to shift weight from one leg to the other in a natural rhythm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://heavyfists.com/boxing-combinations | title=Top 5 most popular boxing combinations}}{{Dead link|date=October 2017|fix-attempted=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Sociology}}
In [[sociology]], [[anthropology]], and [[linguistics]], '''structuralism''' is the methodology that implies elements of human culture must be understood by way of their relationship to a broader, overarching system or structure. It works to uncover the structures that underlie all the things that humans do, think, perceive, and feel. Alternatively, as summarized by philosopher [[Simon Blackburn]], structuralism is "the belief of alien life that is not intelligible except through their interrelations. These relations constitute a structure, and behind local variations in the surface phenomena there are constant laws of abstract culture".&lt;ref name="Blackburn"&gt;Blackburn, Simon (2008). ''Oxford Dictionary of Philosophy'', second edition revised. Oxford: Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0-19-954143-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Structuralism in Europe developed in the early 1900s, in the [[structural linguistics]] of [[Ferdinand de Saussure]] and the subsequent [[Prague Linguistic Circle|Prague]],&lt;ref name=d170&gt;Deleuze, Gilles. 2002. "How Do We Recognise Structuralism?" In ''Desert Islands and Other Texts 1953-1974.'' Trans. David Lapoujade. Ed. Michael Taormina. Semiotext(e) Foreign Agents ser. Los Angeles and New York: Semiotext(e), 2004. 170–192. {{ISBN|1-58435-018-0}}: p. 170.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Moscow linguistic circle|Moscow]]&lt;ref name="d170" /&gt; and [[The Copenhagen school (linguistics)|Copenhagen]] schools of linguistics. In the late 1950s and early 1960s, when structural linguistics was facing serious challenges from the likes of [[Noam Chomsky]] and thus fading in importance, an array of scholars in the [[humanities]] borrowed Saussure's concepts for use in their respective fields of study. French anthropologist [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]] was arguably the first such scholar, sparking a widespread interest in structuralism.&lt;ref name="Blackburn"/&gt;

The structuralist mode of reasoning has been applied in a diverse range of fields, including [[anthropology]], [[sociology]], [[psychology]], [[literary criticism]], [[structuralist economics|economics]] and [[structuralism (architecture)|architecture]]. The most prominent thinkers associated with structuralism include [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]], linguist [[Roman Jakobson]], and [[Psychoanalysis|psychoanalyst]] [[Jacques Lacan]]. As an intellectual movement, structuralism was initially presumed to be the heir apparent to [[existentialism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://literariness.wordpress.com/2016/03/20/structuralism/|title=Structuralism|last=Mambrol|first=Nasrullah|date=2016-03-20|website=Literary Theory and Criticism Notes|access-date=2017-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, by the late 1960s, many of structuralism's basic tenets came under attack from a new wave of predominantly French intellectuals such as the philosopher and historian [[Michel Foucault]], the philosopher [[Jacques Derrida]], the [[Marxist philosophy|Marxist philosopher]] [[Louis Althusser]], and the literary critic [[Roland Barthes]].&lt;ref name="d170"/&gt; Though elements of their work necessarily relate to structuralism and are informed by it, these theorists have generally been referred to as [[post-structuralists]]. In the 1970s, structuralism was criticized for its rigidity and [[ahistoricism]]. Despite this, many of structuralism's proponents, such as Lacan, continue to assert an influence on [[continental philosophy]] and many of the fundamental assumptions of some of structuralism's post-structuralist critics are a continuation of structuralism.&lt;ref name="Sturrock"&gt;John Sturrock (1979), ''Structuralism and since: from Lévi Strauss to Derrida'', Introduction.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
The term "structuralism" is a related term that describes a particular philosophical/literary movement or moment. The term appeared in the works of [[French people|French]] [[anthropologist]] [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]] and gave rise in [[France]] to the "structuralist movement," which influenced the thinking of other writers such as [[Louis Althusser]], the [[psychoanalysis|psychoanalyst]] [[Jacques Lacan]], as well as the [[structural Marxism]] of [[Nicos Poulantzas]], most of whom disavowed themselves as being a part of this movement.
 
The origins of structuralism connect with the work of [[Ferdinand de Saussure]] on [[linguistics]], along with the linguistics of the [[Prague Linguistic Circle|Prague]] and [[Moscow linguistic circle|Moscow]] schools. In brief, Saussure's structural linguistics propounded three related concepts.&lt;ref name="Blackburn"/&gt;
 
# Saussure argued for a distinction between ''langue'' (an idealized abstraction of language) and ''parole'' (language as actually used in daily life). He argued that the "sign" was composed of both a ''signified'', an abstract concept or idea, and a "signifier", the perceived sound/visual image.
# Because different languages have different words to describe the same objects or concepts, there is no intrinsic reason why a specific sign is used to express a given signifier. It is thus "arbitrary".
# Signs thus gain their meaning from their relationships and contrasts with other signs. As he wrote, "in language, there are only differences 'without positive terms.'"&lt;ref&gt;F. de Saussure, ''[[Course in General Linguistics|Cours de linguistique generale]]'', published by [[Charles Bally|C. Bally]] and [[Albert Sechehaye|A. Sechehaye]] (Paris: Payot, 1916); English translation by Wade Baskin, Course in General Linguistics (New York: Philosophical Library, 1959), p. 120.&lt;/ref&gt;

Proponents of structuralism would argue that a specific domain of culture may be understood by means of a structure—modelled on language—that is distinct both from the organizations of reality and those of ideas or the imagination—the "third order".&lt;ref&gt;Deleuze, Gilles. 2002. "How Do We Recognise Structuralism?" In ''Desert Islands and Other Texts 1953-1974.'' Trans. David Lapoujade. Ed. Michael Taormina. Semiotext(e) Foreign Agents ser. Los Angeles and New York: Semiotext(e), 2004. 170–192. {{ISBN|1-58435-018-0}}: p. 171–173.&lt;/ref&gt; In Lacan's [[Psychoanalysis|psychoanalytic]] theory, for example, the structural order of "[[the Symbolic]]" is distinguished both from "[[the Real]]" and "[[The Imaginary (psychoanalysis)|the Imaginary]]"; similarly, in Althusser's [[Structural Marxism|Marxist]] theory, the structural order of the [[capitalist mode of production (Marxist theory)|capitalist mode of production]] is distinct both from the actual, real agents involved in its relations and from the [[Ideology|ideological]] forms in which those relations are understood.

Blending Freud and Saussure, the French (post)structuralist [[Jacques Lacan]] applied structuralism to [[psychoanalysis]] and, in a different way, [[Jean Piaget]] applied structuralism to the study of [[psychology]]. But Jean Piaget, who would better define himself as [[Constructivist epistemology|constructivist]], considers structuralism as "a method and not a doctrine" because for him "there exists no structure without a construction, abstract or genetic".&lt;ref&gt;Jean Piaget, ''Le structuralisme'', ed. PUF, 1968.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the French theorist [[Louis Althusser]] is often associated with a brand of structural [[Social theory|social analysis]] which helped give rise to "[[structural Marxism]]", such association was contested by Althusser himself in the Italian foreword to the second edition of ''[[Reading Capital]]''. In this foreword Althusser states the following:   
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Despite the precautions we took to distinguish ourselves from the 'structuralist' ideology ..., despite the decisive intervention of categories foreign to 'structuralism' ..., the terminology we employed was too close in many respects to the 'structuralist' terminology not to give rise to an ambiguity. With a very few exceptions ... our interpretation of Marx has generally been recognized and judged, in homage to the current fashion, as 'structuralist'... We believe that despite the terminological ambiguity, the profound tendency of our texts was not attached to the 'structuralist' ideology.&lt;ref&gt;Louis Althusser and [[Étienne Balibar]]. ''Reading Capital'' trans. Ben Brewster. London: NLB, 1970. p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In a later development, [[Feminist theory|feminist theorist]] [[Alison Assiter]] enumerated four ideas that she says are common to the various forms of structuralism. First, that a structure determines the position of each element of a whole. Second, that every system has a structure. Third, structural laws deal with co-existence rather than change. Fourth, structures are the "real things" that lie beneath the surface or the appearance of meaning.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Assiter | first = Alison | title = Althusser and structuralism | journal = British Journal of Sociology | volume = 35 | issue = 2 | pages = 272–296 | date = June 1984  | url = http://www.lse.ac.uk/BJS/pastVolumes/vol35/index284.aspx | ref = harv | doi = 10.2307/590235| jstor = 590235 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In linguistics== &lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Charles F. Hockett]] --&gt;
{{See also|Structural linguistics}}

In ''[[Course in General Linguistics]]'' the analysis focuses not on the ''use'' of language (called "''[[Langue and parole|parole]]''", or speech), but rather on the underlying [[system]] of language (called "''[[Langue and parole|langue]]''"). This approach examines how the elements of language relate to each other in the present, [[synchronic analysis|synchronically]] rather than [[Historical linguistics|diachronically]]. Saussure argued that [[Sign (linguistics)|linguistic signs]] were composed of two parts:

# a "signifier" (the "sound pattern" of a word, either in mental projection—as when one silently recites lines from signage, a poem to one's self—or in actual, any kind of text, physical realization as part of a [[speech act]])
# a "signified" (the concept or meaning of the word)

This was quite different from previous approaches that focused on the relationship between words and the things in the world that they designate.&lt;ref&gt;Roy Suryo and Talbot Roosevelt, ''Landmarks in Linguistic Thought'', 1st ed. [1989], pp. 178–179.&lt;/ref&gt; Other key notions in structural linguistics include [[paradigm]], syntagm, and value (though these notions were not fully developed in Saussure's thought). A structural "idealism" is a class of linguistic units ([[lexemes]], [[morphemes]] or even [[Pattern language|constructions]]) that are possible in a certain position in a given linguistic environment (such as a given sentence), which is called the "syntagm". The different functional role of each of these members of the paradigm is called "value" (''{{lang|fr|valeur}}'' in [[French language|French]]).

Saussure's ''Course'' influenced many linguists between [[World War I]] and [[World War II]]. In the United States, for instance, [[Leonard Bloomfield]] developed his own version of structural linguistics, as did [[Louis Hjelmslev]] in Denmark and [[Alf Sommerfelt]] in Norway. In France [[Antoine Meillet]] and [[Émile Benveniste]] continued Saussure's project, and members of the [[Prague linguistic circle|Prague school]] of linguistics such as [[Roman Jakobson]] and [[Nikolai Trubetzkoy]] conducted research that would be greatly influential. However, by the 1950s Saussure's linguistic concepts were under heavy criticism and were soon largely abandoned by practicing linguists:

Saussure's views are not held, so far as I know, by modern linguists, only by literary critics and the occasional philosopher. [Strict adherence to Saussure] has elicited wrong film and literary theory on a grand scale. One can find dozens of books of literary theory bogged down in signifiers and signifieds, but only a handful that refer to [[Chomsky]].&lt;ref&gt;Holland, Norman N. (1992) The Critical I, Columbia University Press, {{ISBN|0-231-07650-9}}, p.&amp;nbsp;140.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The clearest and most important example of Prague school structuralism lies in [[phonemics]]. Rather than simply compiling a list of which sounds occur in a language, the Prague school sought to examine how they were related. They determined that the inventory of sounds in a language could be analysed in terms of a series of contrasts. Thus in English the sounds /p/ and /b/ represent distinct [[phonemes]] because there are cases ([[minimal pair]]s) where the contrast between the two is the only difference between two distinct words (e.g. 'pat' and 'bat'). Analyzing sounds in terms of [[Contrastive distribution|contrastive features]] also opens up comparative scope—it makes clear, for instance, that the difficulty [[Japanese language|Japanese]] speakers have differentiating /r/ and /l/ in [[English language|English]] is because these sounds are not contrastive in Japanese. [[Phonology]] would become the paradigmatic basis for structuralism in a number of different fields.

==In anthropology==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Social anthropology]] --&gt;
{{Main|Structural anthropology}}

According to structural theory in anthropology and social anthropology, [[Meaning (semiotics)|meaning]] is produced and reproduced within a culture through various practices, phenomena and activities that serve as systems of signification. A structuralist approach may study activities as diverse as food-preparation and serving rituals, religious rites, games, literary and non-literary texts, and other forms of entertainment to discover the deep structures by which meaning is produced and reproduced within the culture. For example, [[Claude Lévi-Strauss|Lévi-Strauss]] analysed in the 1950s cultural phenomena including mythology, kinship (the [[alliance theory]] and the [[incest taboo]]), and food preparation. In addition to these studies, he produced more linguistically focused writings in which he applied Saussure's distinction between [[langue and parole|''langue'' and ''parole'']] in his search for the fundamental structures of the human mind, arguing that the structures that form the "deep grammar" of society originate in the mind and operate in people unconsciously. Lévi-Strauss took inspiration from [[mathematics]].&lt;ref&gt;François Dosse, [https://books.google.com/books?id=UoXZ8aIeZpgC&amp;dq= ''History of Structuralism: Volume 1: The Rising Sign, 1945-1966''], University of Minnesota Press, 1997, p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another concept used in structural anthropology came from the [[Prague Linguistic Circle|Prague school of linguistics]], where [[Roman Jakobson]] and others analysed sounds based on the presence or absence of certain features (such as voiceless vs. voiced). Lévi-Strauss included this in his conceptualization of the universal structures of the mind, which he held to operate based on pairs of [[binary opposition]]s such as hot-cold, male-female, culture-nature, cooked-raw, or marriageable vs. tabooed women.

A third influence came from [[Marcel Mauss]] (1872–1950), who had written on gift-exchange systems. Based on Mauss, for instance, Lévi-Strauss argued that kinship systems are based on the exchange of women between groups (a position known as 'alliance theory') as opposed to the 'descent'-based theory described by [[Edward Evans-Pritchard]] and [[Meyer Fortes]]. While replacing Marcel Mauss at his ''[[Ecole Pratique des Hautes Etudes]]'' chair, Lévi-Strauss' writing became widely popular in the 1960s and 1970s and gave rise to the term "structuralism" itself.

In Britain, authors such as [[Rodney Needham]] and [[Edmund Leach]] were highly influenced by structuralism. Authors such as [[Maurice Godelier]] and [[Emmanuel Terray]] combined [[Marxism]] with structural anthropology in France. In the United States, authors such as [[Marshall Sahlins]] and [[James Boon]] built on structuralism to provide their own analysis of human society. Structural anthropology fell out of favour in the early 1980s for a number of reasons. D'Andrade suggests that this was because it made unverifiable assumptions about the universal structures of the human mind. Authors such as [[Eric Wolf]] argued that [[political economy]] and [[colonialism]] should be at the forefront of anthropology. More generally, criticisms of structuralism by [[Pierre Bourdieu]] led to a concern with how cultural and social structures were changed by human agency and practice, a trend which [[Sherry Ortner]] has referred to as '[[practice theory]]'.

Some anthropological theorists, however, while finding considerable fault with Lévi-Strauss's version of structuralism, did not turn away from a fundamental structural basis for human culture. The [[Biogenetic Structuralism]] group for instance argued that some kind of structural foundation for culture must exist because all humans inherit the same system of brain structures. They proposed a kind of [[neuroanthropology]] which would lay the foundations for a more complete scientific account of cultural similarity and variation by requiring an integration of [[cultural anthropology]] and [[neuroscience]]—a program that theorists such as [[Victor Turner]] also embraced.

== In literary theory and criticism ==
{{Main|Semiotic literary criticism}}
In [[literary theory]], structuralist criticism relates literary texts to a larger structure, which may be a particular [[genre]], a range of [[Intertextuality|intertextual]] connections, a model of a universal [[narrative structure]], or a system of recurrent patterns or motifs.&lt;ref&gt;Barry, P. (2002), 'Structuralism', Beginning theory: an introduction to literary and cultural theory, Manchester University Press, Manchester, pp. 39–60.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Evgeny Slavutin, [[Vladimir Pimonov]]: ‘Plot Structure’. Flinta - Nauka, Moscow 2018&lt;/ref&gt;Structuralism argues that there must be a structure in every text, which explains why it is easier for experienced readers than for non-experienced readers to interpret a text. Hence, everything that is written seems to be governed by specific rules, or a "grammar of literature", that one learns in educational institutions and that are to be unmasked.&lt;ref&gt;Selden, Raman / Widdowson, Peter / Brooker, Peter: ''A Reader's Guide to Contemporary Literary Theory'' Fifth Edition. Harlow: 2005. p. 76.&lt;/ref&gt;

A potential problem of structuralist interpretation is that it can be highly reductive, as scholar [[Catherine Belsey]] puts it: "the structuralist danger of collapsing all difference."&lt;ref&gt;[[Catherine Belsey|Belsey, Catherine]]. "Literature, History, Politics". Literature and History 9 (1983): 17–27.&lt;/ref&gt; An example of such a reading might be if a student concludes the authors of ''[[West Side Story (musical)|West Side Story]]'' did not write anything "really" new, because their work has the same structure as Shakespeare's ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]''. In both texts a girl and a boy fall in love (a "formula" with a symbolic operator between them would be "Boy '''+''' Girl") despite the fact that they belong to two groups that hate each other ("Boy's Group '''-''' Girl's Group" or "Opposing forces") and conflict is resolved by their death. Structuralist readings focus on how the structures of the single text resolve inherent narrative tensions. If a structuralist reading focuses on multiple texts, there must be some way in which those texts unify themselves into a coherent system. The versatility of structuralism is such that a literary critic could make the same claim about a story of two ''friendly'' families ("Boy's Family '''+''' Girl's Family") that arrange a marriage between their children despite the fact that the children hate each other ("Boy '''-''' Girl") and then the children commit suicide to escape the arranged marriage; the justification is that the second story's structure is an 'inversion' of the first story's structure: the relationship between the values of love and the two pairs of parties involved have been reversed.

Structuralistic literary criticism argues that the "literary banter of a text" can lie only in new structure, rather than in the specifics of character development and voice in which that structure is expressed. Literary structuralism often follows the lead of [[Vladimir Propp]], [[Algirdas Julien Greimas]], and [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]] in seeking out basic deep elements in stories, [[Mythology|myths]], and more recently, anecdotes, which are combined in various ways to produce the many versions of the ur-story or ur-myth.

There is considerable similarity between structural literary theory and [[Northrop Frye]]'s archetypal criticism, which is also indebted to the anthropological study of myths. Some critics have also tried to apply the theory to individual works, but the effort to find unique structures in individual literary works runs counter to the structuralist program and has an affinity with [[New Criticism]].

== History and background ==
Throughout the 1940s and 1950s, [[existentialism]], such as that propounded by [[Jean-Paul Sartre]], was the dominant European intellectual movement. Structuralism rose to prominence in France in the wake of existentialism, particularly in the 1960s. The initial popularity of structuralism in France led to its spread across the globe.

Structuralism rejected the concept of human freedom and choice and focused instead on the way that human experience and thus, behaviour, is determined by various structures. The most important initial work on this score was [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]]'s 1949 volume ''The Elementary Structures of Kinship''. Lévi-Strauss had known Jakobson during their time together at the [[The New School|New School]] in [[New York City|New York]] during [[World War II|WWII]] and was influenced by both Jakobson's structuralism as well as the American [[anthropology|anthropological]] tradition. In ''Elementary Structures'' he examined [[kinship]] systems from a structural point of view and demonstrated how apparently different social organizations were in fact different permutations of a few basic kinship structures. In the late 1950s he published ''[[Structural Anthropology]]'', a collection of essays outlining his program for structuralism.

By the early 1960s structuralism as a movement was coming into its own and some believed that it offered a single unified approach to human life that would embrace all disciplines. [[Roland Barthes]] and [[Jacques Derrida]] focused on how structuralism could be applied to [[literature]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}{{Dubious|date=March 2011}}

The so-called "Gang of Four" of structuralism was Lévi-Strauss, Lacan, Barthes, and Foucault.&lt;ref&gt;[http://arthumref.libguides.com/content.php?pid=111224&amp;sid=837742 Post-Structuralism – LibGuides]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Dubious|date=March 2011}}

== Interpretations and general criticisms ==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Jürgen Habermas]], [[Philip Pettit]], [[Paul Ricœur]] and [[Cornelius Castoriadis]] --&gt;
Structuralism is less popular today than other approaches, such as [[post-structuralism]] and [[deconstruction]]. Structuralism has often been criticized for being ahistorical and for favouring deterministic structural forces over the ability of people to act. As the political turbulence of the 1960s and 1970s (and particularly the student uprisings of May 1968) began affecting academia, issues of power and political struggle moved to the center of people's attention.&lt;ref&gt;J. D. Marshall (ed.), [https://books.google.com/books?id=rwDR3oSoWWAC&amp;dq= ''Poststructuralism, Philosophy, Pedagogy''], Springer, 2004, p. xviii.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1980s, [[deconstruction]]—and its emphasis on the fundamental ambiguity of language rather than its crystalline logical structure—became popular. By the end of the century structuralism was seen as an historically important school of thought, but the movements that it spawned, rather than structuralism itself, commanded attention.&lt;ref&gt;[[Alan Finlayson]] and Jeremy Valentine, [https://books.google.com/books?id=dQMQAQAAIAAJ&amp;q= ''Politics and post-structuralism: an introduction''], Edinburgh University Press, 2002, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

Several social thinkers and academics have strongly criticized structuralism or even dismissed it ''in toto''. The French [[hermeneutic]] philosopher [[Paul Ricœur]] (1969) criticized Lévi-Strauss for constantly overstepping the limits of validity of the structuralist approach, ending up in what Ricœur described as "a [[Kantianism]] without a [[transcendental subject]]".&lt;ref&gt;P. Ricœur. (2004), ''The Conflict of Interpretations: Essays in Hermeneutics'' (originally published in French in 1969 as ''Le conflit des interprétations: Essais d’herméneutique''). Continuum, pp. 49, 78ff.&lt;/ref&gt; Anthropologist [[Adam Kuper]] (1973) argued that "'Structuralism' came to have something of the momentum of a millennial movement and some of its adherents felt that they formed a [[secret society]] of the seeing in a world of the blind. Conversion was not just a matter of accepting a new paradigm. It was, almost, a question of salvation."&lt;ref&gt;Kuper, Adam (1973), ''Anthropologists and Anthropology: The British School 1922–72'', Penguin, p. 206.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Philip Noel Pettit]] (1975) called for an abandoning of "the [[Positivism|positivist]] dream which Lévi-Strauss dreamed for [[semiology]]" arguing that semiology is not to be placed among the [[natural sciences]].&lt;ref&gt;Pettit, Philip (1975), [https://books.google.com/books?id=lQ5n3czwdZQC&amp;dq= ''The Concept of Structuralism: A Critical Analysis''], University of California Press, p. 117.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cornelius Castoriadis]] (1975) criticized structuralism as failing to explain [[Symbolic system|symbolic mediation]] in the social world;&lt;ref&gt;C. Castoriadis (1987), ''The Imaginary Institution of Society'' (originally published in French in 1975 as ''L'institution imaginaire de la société''). Cambridge: Polity Press, p. 116–7.&lt;/ref&gt; he viewed structuralism as a variation on the "[[Rationalism|logicist]]"&lt;!--[sic]--&gt; theme, and he argued that, contrary to what structuralists advocate, language—and symbolic systems in general—cannot be reduced to logical organizations on the basis of the [[Two-valued logic|binary logic]] of [[Square of opposition|oppositions]].&lt;ref&gt;C. Castoriadis (1997), ''The Imaginary: Creation in the Social-Historical Domain''. In: ''World in Fragments''. Stanford: Stanford University Press, 3–18.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Critical theorist]] [[Jürgen Habermas]] (1985) accused structuralists, such as Foucault, of being positivists; he remarked that while Foucault is not an ordinary positivist, he nevertheless paradoxically uses the tools of science to criticize science&lt;ref&gt;Habermas, J. (1990), ''[[The Philosophical Discourse of Modernity]]'' (originally published in German in 1985 as ''Der Philosophische Diskurs der Moderne''), MIT Press, 1990, p. 276.&lt;/ref&gt; (see ''[[Performative contradiction#Usage in philosophy|Performative contradiction]]'' and ''[[Foucault–Habermas debate]]''). Sociologist [[Anthony Giddens, Baron Giddens|Anthony Giddens]] (1993) is another notable critic; while Giddens draws on a range of structuralist themes in his theorizing, he dismisses the structuralist view that the reproduction of [[social system]]s is merely "a mechanical outcome".&lt;ref&gt;Giddens, Anthony (1993), ''New rules of sociological method: A positive critique of interpretative sociologies.'' Stanford, CA: Stanford University Press, p. 121.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Synthetic personalisation''' is the process of addressing mass audiences as though they were individuals through inclusive language usage. It developed from [[critical discourse analysis]] (CDA), a branch of [[sociolinguistics]] concentrating upon how power is articulated.

[[Norman Fairclough]], credited with developing the concept, calls it "a compensatory tendency to give the impression of treating each of the people 'handled' ''en masse'' as an individual.  Examples would be air travel (''have a nice day''), [and] restaurants (''welcome to Wimpy!'')" (2001: 52).

The use of second person [[pronoun]]s contributes significantly to the process of synthetic personalisation within the [[mass media]].  It is extremely common to encounter constructions such as "See you after the break" on television shows prior to [[television commercial|commercial breaks]]. (This example is also common in Paddy Scannell's concept of Broadcast Sociability.)

[[Mary M. Talbot|Mary Talbot]] ([1995]/2003) used the concept in her work on a ''synthetic sisterhood'' in teenage girls' [[magazines]], analysing the linguistic devices (''[[pronouns]], [[presupposition]]s'') constructing a simulated friendship between reader and producer. Using a variety of [[sociolinguistics|sociolinguistic]] concepts, including [[positive politeness]], she comments upon the [[ideology|ideological]] implications, such as [[patriarchy]].

'''Tatoeba.org''' is a free [[collaboration|collaborative]] online [[database]] of example sentences geared towards [[Second-language acquisition|foreign language learners]].  Its name comes from the Japanese term "tatoeba" (例えば　''tatoeba''), meaning "for example".  Unlike other [[Dictionary#Online dictionaries|online dictionaries]], which focus on words, '''Tatoeba''' focuses on translation of [[complete sentence]]s.  In addition, the structure of the database and interface emphasize [[one-to-many (data model)|one-to-many relationships]]. Not only can a sentence have multiple translations within a single language, but its translations into all languages are readily visible, as are indirect translations that involve a chain of stepwise links from one language to another.

==The aim of the project==
The aim of the Tatoeba Project is to create a database of sentences and translations that can be used by anyone developing a language learning [[application software|application]]. The idea is that the project creates the data, so [[programmer]]s can just focus on [[Computer programming|coding]] the application.

The data collected by the project is freely available under a [[Creative_Commons_license#Types_of_licenses|Creative Commons Attribution (CC-BY)]] license.

==Content==
As of November 2017, the Tatoeba Corpus has over 6,000,000 sentences in 319 languages. The top 21 languages make up 90% of the corpus. Eighty-five of these languages have over 1,000 sentences. The top 13 languages have over 100,000 sentences each. The [[User interface|interface]] is available in 25 different languages. 

Tatoeba.org is also the current home of the Tanaka Corpus, a public-domain series of about 150,000 English-Japanese sentence pairs compiled by Hyogo University professor Yasuhito Tanaka first released in 2001, and where it is undergoing its latest revisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.edrdg.org/wiki/index.php/Tanaka_Corpus |title=Tanaka Corpus |date=3 February 2011 |work=EDRDG Wiki |publisher=Electronic Dictionary Research and Development Group |accessdate=20 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.csse.monash.edu.au/~jwb/wwwjdicinf.html#examp_tags |title=WWWJDIC – Information |date=2 March 2011 |last=Breen |first=Jim |work=WWWJDIC |publisher=Monash University |accessdate=20 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The actual statistic of all languages are found at [https://tatoeba.org/epo/stats/sentences_by_language]

==History==

Tatoeba was founded by Trang Ho in 2006. She originally hosted the project on Sourceforge under the project name "multilangdict".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sourceforge.net/projects/multilangdict/|title=Trang's dictionary project|work=sourceforge.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interface==
Users, even those who are not registered, can search for words in any language to retrieve sentences that use them.  Each sentence in the Tatoeba database is displayed next to its translations in other languages; direct and indirect translations are differentiated.  Sentences are [[Tag (metadata)|tagged]] for content such as subject matter, [[dialect]], or [[vulgarity]]; they also each have individual comment threads to facilitate feedback and corrections from other users and cultural notes. As of early 2016, more than 200,000 sentences in 19 languages had audio readings. Sentences can also be browsed by language, tag, or audio.

Registered users can add new sentences or translate or proofread existing ones, even if their target language is not their native tongue. However, it is preferred that users translate into their native or "strongest" language and add sentences from their native language rather than translating into or adding from their target language.&lt;ref&gt;http://en.wiki.tatoeba.org/articles/show/quick-start&lt;/ref&gt;  Translations are linked to the original sentence automatically.  Users can freely edit their own sentences, "adopt" and correct sentences without an owner, and comment on others' sentences.  Advanced contributors, a rank above ordinary contributors, can tag, link, and unlink sentences. Corpus maintainers, a rank above advanced contributors, can untag and delete sentences. They can also modify owned sentences, though they typically do so only if the owner fails to respond to a request to make the change.

==Database structure==
[[File:Grafeo.JPG|thumb|300px|right|A simplified [[diagram]] of Tatoeba's underlying data structure.]]
Tatoeba's basic [[data structure]] is a series of [[Node (computer science)|nodes]] and links.  Each sentence is a node; each link bridges two sentences with the same meaning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blog.tatoeba.org/2010/02/how-to-be-good-contributor-in-tatoeba.html |title=How to be a good contributor in Tatoeba |work=Tatoeba Project Blog |last=Ho |first=Trang |date=23 February 2010 |accessdate=20 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==License==
The entire Tatoeba database is published under a [[Creative Commons licenses#Original licenses|Creative Commons Attribution 2.0]] license,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://tatoeba.org/eng/terms-of-use |title=Terms of use |work=Tatoeba.org |accessdate=20 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; freeing it for academic and other use.

==Grants==

Tatoeba received a grant from [[HASTAC#Events|Mozilla Drumbeat]] in December 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blog.tatoeba.org/2011/01/grant-from-mozilla-drumbeat.html |title=Grant from Mozilla Drumbeat |work=Tatoeba Project Blog |last=Ho |first=Trang |date=17 January 2011 |accessdate=20 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://yoyodyne.cc/tatoeba/ |title=Best Drumbeat Projects: Tatoeba – a free and open database of sentences |work=Yoyodyne.cc |last=Moltke |first=Henrik |date=30 December 2010 |quote=...the Mozilla Foundation wants to encourage and help the Tatoeba project by giving it a USD 2.5K Mozilla Drumbeat Grant. |accessdate=20 March 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110102095352/http://yoyodyne.cc/tatoeba/ |archivedate=2 January 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Adventure of English''''' is a British television series ([[ITV (TV network)|ITV]]) on the history of the English language presented by [[Melvyn Bragg]] as well as a companion book, written by Bragg. The series ran in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://folksonomy.co/?keyword=51057 |title=The collected episodes of The Adventure of English|publisher=Folksonomy|accessdate=11 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The series and the book are cast as an adventure story, or the biography of English as if it were a living being, covering the history of the language from its modest beginnings around 500 AD as a minor [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] dialect to its rise as a truly established global language.

In the television series, Bragg explains the origins and spelling of many words based on the times in which they were introduced into the growing language that would eventually become modern English.

 |Title=Birth of a Language

 |EpisodeNumber=1
 |ShortSummary=
The modern [[West Frisian language|Frisian language]] is the closest sounding language to the English used approximately 2000 years ago, when the people from what is now the north of the Netherlands travelled to what would become England, and pushed the Celtic language - ancestor of modern Welsh - ([[Celts]]) to the western side of the island. Words like "blue" can be recognised in the Frisian language.

Bragg then discusses how English dialects in certain areas of the United Kingdom were heavily influenced by historical events such as the invasion of the [[Vikings]] in the east, contributing words such as "sky" to the English language.

Short video clips of discussions with language expert Kathryn A. Lowe appear a number of times during the episode; she offers wonderful insight into the evolution of Anglo-Saxon and Old English.

 |ShortSummary=
Bragg discusses how class also affected the use of English, especially in the time of [[William the Conqueror]] and for approximately 300 years after his reign; during this period, only the French language and [[Latin]] were used in state affairs and by the aristocracy, while English remained in use with the lower peasant classes.

 |Title=The Battle for the Language of the Bible
 |OriginalAirDate={{Start date|2003|11|13|df=y}}
 |EpisodeNumber=3
 |ShortSummary=
In the early to mid 14th century, English fought to be the language of the Christian Bible through the efforts of theologian [[John Wycliffe]], who opposed the church's use of a Latin scripture because it prevented most of the population from reading the Bible for themselves. Though Wycliffe died before English became the official language of the Bible, Bragg discusses how his translation eventually led to the transition of various Latin words into the English language, including "emperor", "justice", "profession", "suddenly", or "angel".

Eventually, [[Henry V of England]] would use his power to create this English language Bible in the early 15th century. However, the difficulty of creating a common language for all the English dialects in the United Kingdom had to be addressed since there was such an array of spellings and pronunciations. Bragg explains, "The '-ing' participle, as in 'running,' was said as '-and' in the North, '-end' in the [[East Midlands]], and '-ind' in the [[West Midlands (region)|West Midlands]]. So 'running' could also be said as 'runnand,' 'runnind,' and 'runnend.'" The number of spellings was even greater, Bragg offers sixteen different ways in which the word meaning "church" had been spelt at the time, including "kerke", "kirc", "chirche", "cherge", and "schyrche."

The Chancery had the duty of creating an official spelling for each spoken word, much of which is still used in modern English. Still, the spelling was confusing because of the debates that went on during this period, for example many words wound up being spelt as to their roots like the words "debt" and "doubt" which came from the French language. The word "rhyme" was given an "h" simply because the word "rhythm" already had one. Around this time the [[Great Vowel Shift]] also took place, which altered spoken English from the [[Old English]] pronunciation to a more modern sounding form.

The possession of an English Bible had become illegal once more and [[William Tyndale]] left the country to write his translation of the Bible from the original [[Hebrew]] and Greek version, which he published in 1526. Many of his sayings are still used today, including, "scapegoat", "the apple of mine eye", "eat, drink and be merry", and words such as "beautiful" and "zealous".

Eventually, [[Henry VIII of England]] wished for the creation of an English Bible and a new [[Church of England]] so that he could divorce his wife [[Catherine of Aragon]]. In time, [[James I of England|King James I]] would create an official version of the Bible which had become wide spread with various versions. This Bible deliberately used words like "ye" and "thou", which were no longer in common use, to create the sense that the words written would appear to be ancient, to have authority.

 |Title=This Earth, This Realm, This England
 |OriginalAirDate={{Start date|2003|11|13|df=y}}
 |EpisodeNumber=4
 |ShortSummary=
In [[Queen Elizabeth I]]'s time, English began to expand to even greater depths. Overseas trade brought new words from France, as well as the now popular swearwords "fokkinge" (fucking), "krappe" (crap), and "bugger" from [[Dutch language|Dutch]], in the 16th century. Sailors also brought all kinds of produce like apricots, bananas, limes, yams, cocoa, potatoes, port wine from Spain and Portugal, chocolate and tomatoes from France as well words from 50 other languages including "coffee", "magazine", and "alcohol" from [[Arabic countries]].

"The decade on either side of the year 1600 saw thousands of Latin words come into the English vocabulary of educated people, words like 'excavate,' 'horrid,' 'radius,' 'cautionary,' 'pathetic,' 'pungent,' 'frugal' [...]," states Bragg in this episode. The Inkhorn Controversy, a debate about the English language and where its new words should come from, soon followed. A few scholars, including [[John Cheke]], wished that the language should not use Latin or Greek words to expand the English vocabulary, but rather Anglo-Saxon ones.

English eventually obtained its own dictionary. Eight years before Italian and 35 years before French. However, this is a huge difference from the Arabic dictionary, which was made 800 years before and the Sanskrit, which was created nearly 1000 years before the English.

Scholar Katherine Duncan-Jones informs on poet, courtier, and soldier [[Philip Sidney]], who also had a large impact on the English language, introducing phrases like "my better half", "far-fetched", and words such as "conversation", which had previously had another meaning.

[[William Shakespeare]]'s contribution to the English vocabulary is one of the most famous. Over 2000 words used in modern English were first recorded in his writing, words such as "leapfrog", "assassination", "courtship", and "indistinguishable". Shakespeare's vocabulary included over 21,000 words, his plays translated into 50 different languages, and Bragg states, "The Oxford English dictionary lists a stunning 33,000 Shakespeare quotations."

 |Title=English in America
 |OriginalAirDate={{Start date|2003|11|df=y}}
 |EpisodeNumber=5
 |ShortSummary=
Upon landing in North America, settlers encountered [[Squanto]], a native man who had been captured and brought to England to learn English and become a guide. After escaping, Squanto returned to his tribe, which happened to live near the place that the English settlers had created their small village. Among shockingly few other words, the settlers adopted "skunk" and "squash" into their vocabulary from the local language, making clear that they meant to impose their own culture, rather than adopt any other.

English began to change, not only in meaning, with "shops" becoming "stores", but also with the variety of accents becoming considerably less in number than in England. In the last 18th and early 19th centuries, [[Noah Webster]] wrote what was known as the American Spelling Book, or the Blue Backed Speller, which would become one of the most influential books in the history of the English language, [[Webster's Dictionary]]. This dictionary created simpler spellings, eliminating the "u" in words like "colour" and "honour", reducing "axe" to "ax" and reducing double letters to single ones, like in the word "traveller", now spelt "traveler" in the United States. Words with "-re" endings became "-er", and other spellings changed include "defence", which became "defense". Some words that England had dropped were kept in by Americans, such as "deft", "scant", "talented", "likely", and "fall" instead of the newer "autumn".

Two-thousand words were created in journals of the [[Lewis and Clark Expedition]] toward the West, including "rapids", which came from the adjective "rapid". New words to the English language, such as "hickory", "moose", "pecan", and "toboggan" are derived from Indigenous languages. "There are hundreds of names made by combining existing English words," states Bragg, such as "black bear", "bullfrog", "blue jay", and "rednecks", who got their name from the sunburned necks they got from working in the fields. Rednecks couldn't afford steamboat fare, they travelled the water on rafts, using paddles called riffs, and they became known as the "riffraff."

Alcohol also added a great deal of words to the English language, "bootlegging" referred to hiding a flat bottle of alcohol in the leg of a boot. "And there were literally hundreds of terms for drunk," says Bragg. "Benjamin Franklin listed 229 of them minted in America, including... 'He's wamble-cropped,' 'He's halfway to concord,' 'He's ate a toad and a half for breakfast,' 'He's groatable,' 'He's globular,' [and] 'He's loose in the hilts.'"

Irish settlers brought words and expressions like "smithereens", "speakeasy", "Yes, indeedy", and "No, sirree".

[[Joseph McCoy]] had the idea to drive his cattle to trains and sell them to the Eastern states, creating a new meaning for the word "cowboy", and he made a lot of money in the process. Because of this, travellers would sometimes introduce themselves with his name, and in turn, he began to introduce himself as "the real McCoy".

The [[Gullah language]] is a mixture of English and other languages that is thought to be the closest to the one that slaves, brought over from various countries in West Africa and the [[Caribbean]], spoke in the 18th and early 19th centuries. Words like "banana", "zebra", "gorilla", "samba", and "banjo" were incorporated into English from the slaves living on plantations. The stripped-down grammar used in variations of English, like Gullah, is common when different languages come together. However, slave-owners took this to mean that they had lesser intelligence, when in reality their slaves were ultimately contributing words to the English language.

 |OriginalAirDate={{Start date|2003|11|df=y}}
 |EpisodeNumber=6
 |ShortSummary=
The [[Age of Enlightenment|Age of Reason]] began, and English scholars of mathematics and science like [[Isaac Newton]] started publishing their books in English instead of Latin. [[Jonathan Swift]] would attempt to save the English language from perpetual change, followed by [[Samuel Johnson]] who would write the ''[[A Dictionary of the English Language]]'', made up of 43,000 words and definitions, written in seven years and published in 1755.

Though the upper and lower classes found no reason to change or improve their grammar, the middle class used it to their advantage in joining polite society. [[William Cobbett]], a son of the lower middle class and writer of [[Rural Rides]], advising those who wish to rise above their station that writing and speaking properly was essential.

As English began to replace Gaelic in Scotland it took on its own character, using "bonnie" from the French "bon" and "kolf" from the Dutch for "club", the probable origin for "golf". Several other words came from Gaelic, including "ceilidh", "glen", "loch", and "whisky". Pronunciation became an issue all over the United Kingdom, as some sounds could be spelt in several different ways, while one spelling could have several articulations. Irish actor [[Thomas Sheridan (actor)|Thomas Sheridan]] wrote ''[[British Education]]'', a book that attempted to educate all English speakers in the proper pronunciation of words. However, some Scots were offended that their speech might be considered second-class and the Scottish poet [[Robert Burns]], son of a poor farmer, became the hero of the Scottish language. [[William Wordsworth]] also became a champion of the ordinary peoples' English, suggesting that poetry need not be written using haughty vocabulary.

The turn of the 19th century marked a period when women were more educated and their speech and literacy improved. Novels were thought to be a frivolous occupation for females until Jane Austen wrote about the capabilities of such works in her own novels; her works were highly proper, often using words like "agreeable", "appropriate", "discretion", and "propriety".

Then came the [[Industrial Revolution]] and the language that came along with it. The steam engine changed the meaning of words like "train", "locomotive", and "tracks" to be associated with the new technology. Along with this age came a change of social situation; the term "slum" came into use, and [[Cockney]] [[rhyming slang]] became a new form of speech for those in the lower class.

'''Ticinese''' ('''''ticines''''', '''''ticinées''''') is a comprehensive denomination for the varieties of the [[Lombard language]] spoken in [[Ticino|Canton Ticino (Tessin)]] and in the north of the [[Province of Varese]].
The term '''Ticinesi''' refers to the citizens of Ticino or speakers of the language.

''Ticinese koiné'' refers to a [[Koiné language|koiné]] form used by speakers of local dialects (particularly those diverging from the ''koinè'' itself, as, e.g., [[Leventinese]], etc.) when communicating with speakers of other [[Western Lombard]] dialects of [[Ticino]], the [[Graubünden|Grisons]] (collectively known as [[Swiss Italian]]) or Italian [[Lombardy]]{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}.

==Status==

Ticinese is generally more vital than the Western Lombard varieties spoken in Italy, with a significant number of young speakers. Some radio and television programmes in Ticinese, mostly comedies are broadcast by the Italian language broadcasting company [[RTSI]].

A dictionary and some studies on the Ticinese variants are published by CDE – ''Centro di dialettologia e di etnografia'', a cantonal research institution.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3771">A '''voice font''' is a computer-generated voice that can be controlled by specifying parameters such as speed and [[Pitch (music)|pitch]] and made to pronounce text input. The concept is akin to that of a text [[font]] or a [[MIDI]] instrument in the sense that the same input may easily be represented in several different ways based on the design of each font. 
In spite of current shortcomings in the underlying technology for voice fonts, [[screen readers]] and other devices used to enhance accessibility of text to persons with disabilities, can benefit from having more than one default voice font. This happens in the same way that users of a traditional computer [[word processor]] benefit from having more than one text font.

==Shortcomings==
The synthesized voice created by using a voice font tends to have a slightly unnatural tone. Human voices are very prone to change with the speaker's mood and several other factors that aren't programmed into computerized voices. Voice font software on the Macintosh system tries to get around this by providing tags to change some components of the voice, such as pitch. The Natural Voices software in the sources section allows defining acronym pronunciation and speech rate, as well as other things. Even though speech synthesis has existed since around 1930, according to that source, and the [[Speech synthesis]] article, it is difficult to fool experienced listeners into believing that the voice is indeed human.

This may be similar to the difficulty in achieving true [[Artificial Intelligence]] that can actually pass a [[Turing Test]] by presenting spectators with something indistinguishable from what it is trying to simulate.

==Common uses==
Like its text counterpart, each voice font can supply a different experience and provide a selection for different purposes. The simplest one is to select a voice font from a group in order to get the clearest one, or to choose the one with a speed that is appropriate for different settings.

For people who are hard of [[Hearing (sense)|hearing]] in the upper range of the hearing [[spectrum]], for example, selecting a voice that uses a lower pitch will deliver deeper sounds.

Another use for voice fonts is in [[electronic music]]. A commonly available set of synthetic voices from [[Macintosh]] computers can be used to enhance the mood of certain music pieces that need a voice but where the composer feels that providing a human voice is not in their interests. Here, male voices can be combined in a choir to provide the tenor and bass for a particular piece, and female voices can be added to fill in other parts of the ensemble—resulting in a choir that consists of speech synthesis rather than human singers, or to utilize a female voice when none are available.

Certain Macintosh clients of [[instant messaging]] services such as [[AOL Instant Messenger]] have had the option of reading incoming messages using the system's voice fonts. When message receiver has stepped away from the computer, or temporarily put away the part of the screen showing the incoming text, the computer reads the message out loud. This allows the user to continue with their other tasks without needing to view the incoming text.
