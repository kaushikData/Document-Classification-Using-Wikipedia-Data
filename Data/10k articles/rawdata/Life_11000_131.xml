[[File:Ampulex dementor 2.png|thumb|Anatomical details of ''A. dementor'']]
'''''Ampulex dementor''''' is a species of [[cockroach wasp]] native to [[Thailand]], described in 2014 by Michael Ohl of the [[Museum für Naturkunde]] in [[Berlin, Germany]]. The [[Specific name (zoology)|species name]] was selected by visitors to the museum, in efforts to connect members of the public to issues of [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]] and the description of [[biodiversity]].

== Description ==

''A. dementor'' is colored in red and black. Its [[Mandible (insect mouthpart)|mandibles]] and most of its [[Clypeus (arthropod anatomy)|clypeus]], [[prothorax]], [[mesothorax]], and posterolateral areas are all light red, while its abdomen and much of its head is black. Its wings are slightly yellow. It has long, slender legs, and a tubular petiole, as long as the [[tergum]]. Female length varies between 9.6 and 10.9&amp;nbsp;mm; the male length is unknown.&lt;ref name="plosone"/&gt;

== Behavior ==

The wasp has an unusual behavior towards [[cockroaches]]. As it stings its prey, it releases a [[toxin]] into the victim's neural nodes. This toxin blocks the cockroach's [[octopamine (neurotransmitter)|octopamine]] receptors, leaving the cockroach alive, but unable to direct its movements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Izadi|first1=Elahe|title=Say hello to the dementor wasp. It turns cockroaches into zombies.|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/speaking-of-science/wp/2015/05/27/say-hello-to-the-dementor-wasp-it-turns-cockroaches-into-zombies/|website=[[Washington Post]]|accessdate=28 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its [[muscle]] functions still active, the cockroach then "runs into" the wasp's nest, allowing for its easier capture by the wasp.&lt;ref name="plosone"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ohl|first=Michael|author2=Lohrmann, Volker |author3=Breitkreuz, Laura |author4=Kirschey, Lukas |author5= Krause, Stefanie |title=The Soul-Sucking Wasp by Popular Acclaim – Museum Visitor Participation in Biodiversity Discovery and Taxonomy|journal=PLoS ONE|date=2014|volume=9|issue=4|pages=e95068|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0095068|url=http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0095068 |pmid=24755672 |pmc=3995701}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology ==

At the time of the wasp's description, visitors to the [[Museum für Naturkunde]] (in which the species was described) were asked through pamphlet distribution to choose between four names, of which the third was chosen:&lt;ref name="plosone"/&gt;

* ''Ampulex bicolor'' (the Latin word means "two colors", from ''[[wikt:bis#Latin|bis]]'' = twice) due to its very distinctive colours, black and red
* ''Ampulex mon'', an allusion to its origin, Thailand, and one of the earliest "ethnic groups" to live there
* ''Ampulex dementor'', referring to its behavioral resemblance with the [[Dementors]], fictional creatures from the [[Harry Potter books|Harry Potter Books]] franchise, who suck their prey's soul, leaving it an empty body with neither thoughts nor emotions, in a way like the wasp
* ''Ampulex plagiator'', because the species is an [[ant mimic]], a species which "copies" the ant in many ways such as its way of moving and general appearance, making it a plagiarist of said ant

In [[philosophy]], '''being''' means the existence of a thing. Anything that exists has being. [[Ontology]] is the branch of philosophy that studies being. Being is a concept encompassing [[Objectivity (philosophy)|objective]] and [[Subjectivity|subjective]] features of [[reality]] and [[existence]]. Anything that partakes in being is also called a "being", though often this usage is limited to entities that have subjectivity (as in the expression "[[human being]]"). The notion of "being" has, inevitably, been elusive and controversial in the history of philosophy, beginning in Western philosophy with attempts among the [[pre-Socratics]] to deploy it intelligibly. The first effort to recognize and define the concept came from [[Parmenides]], who famously said of it that "what is-is". Common words such as "is", "are", and "am" refer directly or indirectly to being.

As an example of efforts in recent times, [[Martin Heidegger]] (who himself drew on ancient Greek sources) adopted after German terms like ''[[Dasein]]'' to articulate the topic.&lt;ref name="dasein1"&gt;Heidegger, the day  ''[[Being and Time|Sein und Zeit]]'', p.&amp;nbsp;27: "this entity which each of us is himself&amp;nbsp;... we shall denote by the term 'Dasein'."&lt;/ref&gt; Several modern approaches build on such continental European exemplars as Heidegger, and apply metaphysical results to the understanding of human psychology and the human condition generally (notably in the [[Existentialism|Existentialist]] tradition). By contrast, in mainstream [[Analytical philosophy]] the topic is more confined to abstract investigation, in the work of such influential theorists as [[W. V. O. Quine]], to name one of many. One of the most fundamental questions that continues to exercise philosophers is posed by [[William James]]: "How comes the world to be here at all instead of the nonentity which might be imagined in its place?&amp;nbsp;... from nothing to being there is no logical bridge."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Some problems of philosophy: a beginning of an introduction to philosophy|first=William|last=James|authorlink=William James|pages=38, 40|year=1916|location=New York|publisher=Longmans, Green and Co}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The substantial being==

===Being and the substance theorists===
The deficit of such a bridge was first encountered in history by the [[Pre-Socratic philosophy|Pre-Socratic philosophers]] during the process of evolving a classification of all beings (noun). Aristotle, who wrote after the Pre-Socratics, applies the term [[Categories (Aristotle)|category]] (perhaps not originally) to ten highest-level classes. They comprise one category of substance ([[ousia]]e) existing independently (man, tree) and nine categories of accidents, which can only exist in something else (time, place). In Aristotle, substances are to be clarified by stating their [[definition]]: a note expressing a larger class (the genus) followed by further notes expressing [[Differentia|specific difference]]s (differentiae) within the class. The substance so defined was a species. For example, the species, man, may be defined as an animal (genus) that is rational (difference). As the difference is potential within the genus; that is, an animal may or may not be rational, the difference is not identical to, and may be distinct from, the genus.

Applied to being, the system fails to arrive at a definition for the simple reason that no difference can be found. The species, the genus, and the difference are all equally being: a being is a being that is being. The genus cannot be nothing because nothing is not a class of everything. The trivial solution that being is being added to nothing is only a [[tautology (logic)|tautology]]: being is being. There is no simpler intermediary between being and non-being that explains and classifies being.

[[File:Being Parmenides.png|thumb|right|The Being according to [[Parmenides]] is like the mass of a sphere.]]
Pre-Socratic reaction to this deficit was varied. As [[Substance theory|substance theorists]] they accepted [[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]] the hypothesis that appearances are deceiving, that reality is to be reached through reasoning. [[Parmenides]] reasoned that if everything is identical to being and being is a category of the same thing then there can be neither differences between things nor any change. To be different, or to change, would amount to [[Becoming (philosophy)|becoming]] or being non-being; that is, not existing. Therefore, being is a homogeneous and non-differentiated sphere and the appearance of beings is illusory. [[Heraclitus]], on the other hand, foreshadowed modern thought by denying existence. Reality does not exist, it flows, and beings are an illusion upon the flow.

[[Aristotle]] knew of this tradition when he began his ''Metaphysics'', and had already drawn his own conclusion, which he presented under the guise of asking what being is:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Aristotle|authorlink=Aristotle|title=[[Metaphysics (Aristotle)|Metaphysics]]|chapter=Book VII Section 1 (paragraph 1028b)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;"And indeed the question which was raised of old is raised now and always, and is always the subject of doubt, viz., what being is, is just the question, what is substance? For it is this that some assert to be one, others more than one, and that some assert to be limited in number, others unlimited. And so we also must consider chiefly and primarily and almost exclusively what that is which is in this sense."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

and reiterates in no uncertain terms:&lt;ref&gt;''Metaphysics'' Chapter VII, Section 4 (paragraph 1030a).&lt;/ref&gt; "Nothing, then, which is not a species of a genus will have an essence – only species will have it ....". Being, however, for Aristotle, is not a genus.

===Aristotle's theory of act and potency===
One might expect a solution to follow from such certain language but none does. Instead Aristotle launches into a rephrasing of the problem, the [[Potentiality and actuality|Theory of Act and Potency]]. In the definition of man as a two-legged animal Aristotle presumes that "two-legged" and "animal" are parts of other beings, but as far as man is concerned, are only potentially man. At the point where they are united into a single being, man, the being, becomes actual, or real. Unity is the basis of actuality:&lt;ref&gt;''Metaphysics'', Book IX, Chapter 10 (paragraph 1051b).&lt;/ref&gt; "... 'being' is being combined and one, and 'not being' is being not combined but more than one." Actuality has taken the place of existence, but Aristotle is no longer seeking to know what the actual is; he accepts it without question as something generated from the potential. He has found a "half-being" or a "pre-being", the potency, which is fully being as part of some other substance. Substances, in Aristotle, unite what they actually are now with everything they might become.

==The transcendental being==
Some of Thomas Aquinas' propositions were reputedly condemned by Étienne Tempier, the local Bishop of Paris (not the Papal Magisterium itself) in 1270 and 1277,&lt;ref&gt;For text of condemnations 1277 (technically still 1276 at the date, since before 25 of March) see David Piché, La condemnation parisienne de 1277, [http://www.vrin.fr/html/main.htm?action=loadbook&amp;isbn=2711614166], parallel Latin text with his French translation, or online list Latin only with footnotes, by Hans-Georg Lundahl, [http://petitlien.com/tempier]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wallace, William A. “Thomism and Its Opponents.” ''Dictionary of the Middle Ages''. Ed. Joseph R. Strayer. Vol. 12. New York: Scribner, 1982. 38–45. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; but his dedication to the use of philosophy to elucidate theology was so thorough that he was proclaimed a [[Doctor of the Church]] in 1568. Those who adopt it are called [[Thomism|Thomists]].

===Thomistic analogical predication of being===
In a single sentence, parallel to Aristotle's statement asserting that being is substance, St. Thomas pushes away from the Aristotelian doctrine:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The metaphysical thought of Thomas Aquinas: from finite being to uncreated being|first=John F. |last=Wippel|page=75|series=Monographs of the Society for Mediaeval and Renaissance Philosophy, No. 1|year=2000|publisher=The Catholic University of America Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Being is not a genus, since it is not predicated univocally but only analogically." His term for analogy is Latin ''analogia''. In the categorical classification of all beings, all substances are partly the same: man and chimpanzee are both animals and the animal part in man is "the same" as the animal part in chimpanzee. Most fundamentally all substances are matter, a theme taken up by science, which postulated one or more matters, such as earth, air, fire or water ([[Empedocles]]). In today's chemistry the carbon, hydrogen, oxygen and nitrogen in a chimpanzee are identical to the same elements in a man.

The original text reads, ''"Although equivocal predications must be reduced to univocal, still in actions, the non-univocal agent must precede the univocal agent. For the non-univocal agent is the universal cause of the whole species, as for instance the sun is the cause of the generation of all men; whereas the univocal agent is not the universal efficient cause of the whole species (otherwise it would be the cause of itself, since it is contained in the species), but is a particular cause of this individual which it places under the species by way of participation. Therefore the universal cause of the whole species is not an univocal agent; and the universal cause comes before the particular cause. But this universal agent, whilst it is not univocal, nevertheless is not altogether equivocal, otherwise it could not produce its own likeness, but rather it is to be called an analogical agent, as all univocal predications are reduced to one first non-univocal analogical predication, which is being."''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/summa/1013.htm#article5|title=SUMMA THEOLOGIAE: The names of God (Prima Pars, Q. 13)|author=|date=|website=www.newadvent.org|accessdate=15 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If substance is the highest category and there is no substance, being, then the unity perceived in all beings by virtue of their existing must be viewed in another way. St. Thomas chose the analogy: all beings are like, or analogous to, each other in existing. This comparison is the basis of his Analogy of Being. The analogy is said of being in many different ways, but the key to it is the real distinction between existence and essence. Existence is the principle that gives reality to an essence not the same in any way as the existence: "If things having essences are real, and it is not of their essence to be, then the reality of these things must be found in some principle other than (really distinct from) their essence."&lt;ref name=Kreyche70&gt;{{harvnb|Kreyche|1959|p=70}}&lt;/ref&gt; Substance can be real or not. What makes an individual substance – a man, a tree, a planet – real is a distinct act, a "to be", which actuates its unity. An analogy of proportion is therefore possible:&lt;ref name=Kreyche70/&gt; "essence is related to existence as potency is related to act."

Existences are not things; they do not themselves exist, they lend themselves to essences, which do not intrinsically have them. They have no nature; an existence receives its nature from the essence it actuates. Existence is not being; it gives being – here a customary phrase is used, existence is a principle (a source) of being, not a previous source, but one which is continually in effect. The stage is set for the concept of God as the cause of all existence, who, as the Almighty, holds everything actual without reason or explanation as an act purely of will.

===The transcendentals===
Aristotle's classificatory scheme had included the five [[predicables]], or characteristics that might be predicated of a substance. One of these was the [[Property (philosophy)|property]], an essential universal true of the species, but not in the definition (in modern terms, some examples would be grammatical language, a property of man, or a spectral pattern characteristic of an element, both of which are defined in other ways). Pointing out that predicables are predicated [[Univocity|univocally]] of substances; that is, they refer to "the same thing" found in each instance, St. Thomas argued that whatever can be said about being is not univocal, because all beings are unique, each actuated by a unique existence. It is the analogous possession of an existence that allows them to be identified as being; therefore, being is an analogous predication.

Whatever can be predicated of all things is universal-like but not universal, category-like but not a category. St. Thomas called them (perhaps not originally) the ''transcendentia'', "[[transcendentals]]", because they "climb above" the categories, just as being climbs above substance. Later academics also referred to them as "the properties of being."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=A companion to metaphysics|editor-first=Jaegwon |editor-last=Kim|editor2-first=Ernest |editor2-last=Sosa|pages=21–22|series=Blackwell Companions to philosophy|year=1995|contribution=Aquinas, St. Thomas|first=Jan A.|last=Aersten}}&lt;/ref&gt; The number is generally three or four.

==Being in Islamic philosophy==
The nature of "being" has also been debated and explored in [[Islamic philosophy]], notably by [[Ibn Sina]] ([[Avicenna]]), [[Suhrawardi Maqtul|Suhrawardi]], and [[Mulla Sadra]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iranchamber.com/personalities/msadra/mulla_sadra.php|title=Iranian Personalities: Sadr Al-Din Mohammad Shirazi|author=|date=|website=www.iranchamber.com|accessdate=15 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;br /&gt; [[Indo-European copula|A modern linguistic approach]] which notices that [[Persian language]] has exceptionally developed two kinds of "[[Indo-European copula|is]]"es, i.e. ''ast'' ("is", as a [[Copula (linguistics)|copula]]) and ''hast'' (as an existential "is") examines the linguistic properties of the two lexemes in the first place, then evaluates how the statements made by other languages with regard to ''being'' can stand the test of Persian frame of reference.

In this modern linguistic approach, it is noticed that the original language of the source, e.g. [[Greek language|Greek]] (like [[German language|German]] or [[French language|French]] or [[English language|English]]), has only one word for two concepts, ''ast'' and ''hast'', or, like [[Arabic language|Arabic]], has no word at all for either word. It therefore exploits the Persian ''hast'' (existential ''is'') versus ''ast'' (predicative ''is'' or [[Copula (linguistics)|copula]]) to address both Western and Islamic ontological arguments on ''being'' and ''existence''.&lt;ref&gt;Toofan, M. ''Zabān ast yā hast?''(Language: is or exists?. Ketāb-e Tehran, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

This linguistic method shows the scope of confusion created by languages which cannot differentiate between existential be and copula. It manifests, for instance, that the main theme of [[Martin Heidegger|Heidegger]]'s ''[[Being and Time]]'' is  ''astī'' (is-ness) rather than ''hastī'' (existence). When, in the beginning of his book, [[Martin Heidegger|Heidegger]] claims that people always talk about existence in their everyday language, without knowing what it means, the example he resorts to is: "the sky ''is'' blue" which in Persian can be ONLY translated with the use of the copula ''ast'', and says nothing about ''being'' or ''existence''.

In the same manner, the linguistic method addresses the ontological works written in Arabic. Since [[Arabic language|Arabic]], like [[Latin]] in Europe, had become the official language of philosophical and scientific works in the so-called Islamic World, the early Persian or Arab philosophers had difficulty discussing ''being'' or ''existence'', since the [[Arabic language]], like other Semitic languages, had no verb for either predicative "be" ([[Copula (linguistics)|copula]]) or existential "be". So if you try to translate the aforementioned [[Martin Heidegger|Heidegger]]'s example into Arabic it appears as السماء زرقاء (viz. "The Sky-- blue") with no linking "is" to be a sign of existential statement. To overcome the problem, when translating the [[ancient Greek philosophy]], certain words were coined like ایس ''aysa'' (from Arabic لیس ''laysa'' 'not') for '[[Indo-European copula|is]]'. Eventually the Arabic verb وجد ''wajada'' (to find) prevailed, since it was thought that whatever is existent, is to be "''found''" in the world. Hence ''existence'' or Being was called وجود ''wujud'' (Cf. [[Swedish language|Swedish]] ''finns'' [found]&gt; there exist; also the [[Medieval Latin]] coinage of ''exsistere'' 'standing out (there in the world)' &gt; appear&gt; exist).&lt;br /&gt;  Now, with regard to the fact that Persian, as the mother tongue of both [[Avicenna]] and [[Mulla Sadra|Sadrā]], was in conflict with either Greek or Arabic in this regard, these philosophers should have been warned implicitly by their mother tongue not to confuse two kinds of linguistic beings (viz. [[Copula (linguistics)|copula]] vs. existential). In fact when analyzed thoroughly, [[Copula (linguistics)|copula]], or Persian ''ast'' ('is') indicates an ever-moving chain of relations with no fixed ''entity'' to hold onto (every ''entity'', say A, will be dissolved into "A is B" and so on, as soon as one tries to define it). Therefore, the whole reality or what we see as existence ("found" in our world) resembles an ever-changing world of ''astī'' (is-ness) flowing in time and space. On the other hand, while Persian ''ast''  can be considered as the 3rd person singular of the verb 'to be', there is no verb but an arbitrary one supporting ''hast'' ('is' as an existential be= exists) has neither future nor past tense and nor a negative form of its own: ''hast'' is just a single untouchable lexeme. It needs no other linguistic element to be complete (''Hast.'' is a complete sentence meaning "s/he it exists"). In fact, any manipulation of the arbitrary verb, e.g. its conjugation, turns ''hast'' back into a copula.

Eventually from such linguistic analyses, it appears that while ''astī'' (is-ness) would resemble the world of [[Heraclitus]], ''hastī'' (existence) would rather approaches a metaphysical concept resembling the [[Parmenides|Parmenidas]]'s interpretation of ''existence''.

In this regard, [[Avicenna]], who was a firm follower of [[Aristotle]], could not accept either Heraclitian ''is-ness'' (where only constant was ''change''), nor Parmenidean ''monist immoveable existence'' (the ''hastī'' itself being constant). To solve the contradiction, it so appeared to Philosophers of Islamic world that [[Aristotle]] considered the core of existence (i.e. its ''[[Substance theory|substance]]''/''[[essence]]'') as a fixed constant, while its facade ([[Accident (philosophy)|accident]]) was prone to change. To translate such a philosophical image into Persian it is like having ''hastī'' (existence) as a unique constant core covered by ''astī'' (is-ness) as a cloud of ever-changing relationships. It is clear that the Persian language, deconstructs such a composite as a sheer mirage, since it is not clear how to link the interior core (existence) with the exterior shell (is-ness). Furthermore, ''hast'' cannot be linked to anything but itself (as it is self-referent).

The argument has a theological echos as well: assuming that God is the ''Existence'', beyond time and space, a question is raised by philosophers of the Islamic world as how he, as a transcendental existence, may ever create or contact a world of ''is-ness'' in space-time.

However, [[Avicenna]] who was more philosopher than theologian, followed the same line of argumentation as that of his ancient master, [[Aristotle]], and tried to reconcile between ''ast'' and ''hast'', by considering the latter as higher order of existence than the former. It is like a hierarchical order of existence. It was a philosophical [[Tower of Babel]] that the restriction of his own mother tongue (Persian) would not allow to be built, but he could maneuver in Arabic by giving the two concepts the same name ''wujud'', although with different attributes. So, implicitly, ''astī'' (is-ness) appears as ممکن الوجود "momken-al-wujud" (contingent being), and ''hastī'' (existence) as واجب الوجود "wājeb-al-wujud" (necessary being).

On the other hand, centuries later, [[Mulla Sadra|Sadrā]], chose a more radical route, by inclining towards the reality of ''astī'' (is-ness),  as the true mode of existence, and tried to get rid of the concept of ''hastī'' (existence as fixed or immovable). Thus, in his philosophy, the universal movement penetrates deep into the [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]] ''[[Substance theory|substance]]''/''[[essence]]'',  in unison with changing [[Accident (philosophy)|accident]].  He called this deep existential change حرکت جوهری ''harekat-e jowhari'' (Substantial Movement). In such a changing existence, the whole world has to go through instantaneous annihilation and recreation incessantly, while as [[Avicenna]] had predicted in his remarks on Nature, such a universal change or substantial movement would eventually entail the shortening and lengthening of time as well which has never been observed. This logical objection, which was made on Aristotle's argumentation, could not be answered in the ancient times or medieval age, but now it does not sound contradictory to the real nature of Time (as addressed in relativity theory), so by a reverse argument, a philosopher may indeed deduce that everything is changing (moving) even in the deepest core of Being.

==Being in the Age of Reason==
Although innovated in the late [[medieval]] period, Thomism was dogmatized in the [[Renaissance]]. From roughly 1277 to 1567, it dominated the philosophic landscape. The [[rationalist]] philosophers, however, with a new emphasis on [[Reason]] as a tool of the intellect, brought the classical and medieval traditions under new scrutiny, exercising a new concept of [[doubt]], with varying outcomes. Foremost among the new doubters were the [[Empiricism|empiricists]], the advocates of [[scientific method]], with its emphasis on [[experiment]]ation and reliance on evidence gathered from sensory experience. In parallel with the [[revolution]]s against rising political [[Absolutism (European history)|absolutism]] based on [[established religion]] and the replacement of [[faith]] by reasonable faith, new systems of metaphysics were promulgated in the lecture halls by charismatic professors, such as [[Immanuel Kant]], and [[Hegel]]. The late 19th and 20th centuries featured an emotional return to the concept of existence under the name of [[existentialism]]. These philosophers were concerned mainly with ethics and religion. The metaphysical side became the domain of the [[phenomenalism|phenomenalists]]. In parallel with these philosophies Thomism continued under the protection of the Catholic Church; in particular, the [[Jesuit order]].

===Empiricist doubts===
[[Rationalism]] and [[empiricism]] have had many definitions, most concerned with specific schools of philosophy or groups of philosophers in particular countries, such as Germany. In general rationalism is the predominant school of thought in the multi-national, cross-cultural [[Age of reason]], which began in the century straddling 1600 as a conventional date,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=age of reason|encyclopedia=dictionary.com|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/age+of+reason|accessdate=8 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; empiricism is the reliance on sensory data&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=empiricism|encyclopedia=dictionary.com|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/empiricism|accessdate=9 January 2009| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090125191857/http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/empiricism| archivedate= 25 January 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; gathered in experimentation by scientists of any country, who, in the Age of Reason were rationalists. An early professed empiricist, [[Thomas Hobbes]], known as an eccentric denizen of the court of [[Charles II of England]] (an "old bear"), published in 1651 ''[[Leviathan (Hobbes book)|Leviathan]]'', a political treatise written during the [[English civil war]], containing an early [[manifesto]] in English of rationalism.
Hobbes said:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hobbes|1651|pp=18, 21–22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;"The Latines called Accounts of mony Rationes ... and thence it seems to proceed that they extended the word Ratio, to the faculty of Reckoning in all other things....When a man reasoneth hee does nothing else but conceive a summe totall ... For Reason ... is nothing but Reckoning ... of the consequences of generall names agreed upon, for the marking and signifying of our thoughts ...."&lt;/blockquote&gt;
In Hobbes reasoning is the right process of drawing conclusions from definitions (the "names agreed upon"). He goes on to define error as self-contradiction of definition ("an absurdity, or senselesse Speech"&lt;ref name=hobbes23&gt;{{harvnb|Hobbes|1651|p=23}}&lt;/ref&gt;) or conclusions that do not follow the definitions on which they are supposed to be based. Science, on the other hand, is the outcome of "right reasoning," which is based on "natural sense and imagination", a kind of sensitivity to nature, as "nature it selfe cannot erre."

Having chosen his ground carefully Hobbes launches an [[Epistemology|epistemological]] attack on [[metaphysics]]. The academic philosophers had arrived at the [[Hylomorphism (Aristotelian)|Theory of Matter and Form]] from consideration of certain natural [[paradox]]es subsumed under the general heading of the Unity Problem. For example, a body appears to be one thing and yet it is distributed into many parts. Which is it, one or many? Aristotle had arrived at the real distinction between [[Matter (philosophy)|matter]] and [[Substantial form|form]], metaphysical components whose interpenetration produces the paradox. The whole unity comes from the substantial form and the distribution into parts from the matter. Inhering in the parts giving them really distinct unities are the [[Accident (philosophy)|accidental forms]]. The unity of the whole being is actuated by another really distinct principle, the existence.

If nature cannot err, then there are no paradoxes in it; to Hobbes, the paradox is a form of the absurd, which is inconsistency:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hobbes|1651|p=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Natural sense and imagination, are not subject to absurdity" and "For error is but a deception ... But when we make a generall assertion, unlesse it be a true one, the possibility of it is inconceivable. And words whereby we conceive nothing but the sound, are those we call Absurd ...." Among Hobbes examples are "round quadrangle", "immaterial substance", "free subject."&lt;ref name=hobbes23/&gt; Of the scholastics he says:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hobbes|1651|p=501}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;"Yet they will have us beleeve, that by the Almighty power of God, one body may be at one and the same time in many places [the problem of the universals]; and many bodies at one and the same time in one place [the whole and the parts]; ... And these are but a small part of the Incongruencies they are forced to, from their disputing philosophically, instead of admiring, and adoring of the Divine and Incomprehensible Nature ...."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The real distinction between essence and existence, and that between form and matter, which served for so long as the basis of metaphysics, Hobbes identifies as "the Error of Separated Essences."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hobbes|1651|p=500}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The words "Is, or Bee, or Are, and the like" add no meaning to an argument nor do derived words such as "Entity, Essence, Essentially, Essentiality", which "are the names of nothing"&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hobbes|1651|pp=498–499}}.&lt;/ref&gt; but are mere "Signes" connecting "one name or attribute to another: as when we say, ''"a man is a living body"'', we mean not that the ''man'' is one thing, the ''living body'' another, and the ''is'', or ''being'' a third: but that the ''man'', and the ''living body'', is the same thing; ..."  Metaphysiques, Hobbes says, is "far from the possibility of being understood" and is "repugnant to natural reason."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hobbes|1651|pp=496–497}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Being to Hobbes (and the other empiricists) is the physical universe:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hobbes|1651|p=497}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;The world, (I mean ... the Universe, that is, the whole masse of all things that are) is corporeall, that is to say, Body; and hath the dimension of magnitude, namely, Length, Bredth and Depth: also every part of Body, is likewise Body ... and consequently every part of the Universe is Body, and that which is not Body, is no part of the Universe: and because the Universe is all, that which is no part of it is nothing; and consequently no where."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Hobbes' view is representative of his tradition. As Aristotle offered the categories and the act of existence, and Aquinas the analogy of being, the rationalists also had their own system, the [[great chain of being]], an interlocking hierarchy of beings from God to dust.

===Idealist systems===
In addition to the [[materialism]] of the empiricists, under the same [[aegis]] of Reason, rationalism produced systems that were diametrically opposed now called [[idealism]], which denied the reality of [[matter]] in favor of the reality of [[mind]]. By a 20th-century classification, the idealists ([[Immanuel Kant|Kant]], [[Hegel]] and others), are considered the beginning of [[continental philosophy]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fritzman|first=J. M.|date=2011-10-12|title=Review of Kant, Kantianism, and Idealism: The Origins of Continental Philosophy|url=https://ndpr.nd.edu/news/kant-kantianism-and-idealism-the-origins-of-continental-philosophy/|issn=1538-1617}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the empiricists are the beginning, or the immediate predecessors, of [[analytical philosophy]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/analytic-philosophy|title=Analytic philosophy|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2018-10-06|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Being in continental philosophy and existentialism==
Some philosophers deny that the concept of "being" has any meaning at all, since we only define an object's existence by its relation to other objects, and actions it undertakes. The term "I am" has no meaning by itself; it must have an action or relation appended to it. This in turn has led to the thought that "being" and [[nothing]]ness are closely related, developed in [[Existentialism|existential]] philosophy.

[[Existentialism|Existentialist]] philosophers such as [[Jean-Paul Sartre|Sartre]], as well as [[continental philosophy|continental philosophers]] such as [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]] and [[Martin Heidegger|Heidegger]] have also written extensively on the concept of being. Hegel distinguishes between the being of objects ([[being in itself]]) and the being of people (''[[Geist (philosophy)|Geist]])''.  Hegel, however, did not think there was much hope for delineating a "meaning" of being, because being stripped of all predicates is simply nothing.

Heidegger, in his quest to re-pose the original pre-Socratic question of Being, wondered at how to meaningfully ask the question of the meaning of being, since it is both the greatest, as it includes everything that is, and the least, since no particular thing can be said of it.  He distinguishes between different modes of beings: a privative mode is [[present-at-hand]], whereas beings in a fuller sense are described as [[ready-to-hand]].  The one who asks the question of Being is described as Da-sein ("there/here-being") or '''[[being-in-the-world]].''' Sartre, popularly understood as misreading Heidegger (an understanding supported by Heidegger's essay "Letter on Humanism" which responds to Sartre's famous address, "Existentialism is a Humanism"), employs modes of being in an attempt to ground his concept of freedom ontologically by distinguishing between being-in-itself and being-for-itself.

Being is also understood as one's "state of being," and hence its common meaning is in the context of human (personal) [[experience]], with aspects that involve expressions and manifestations coming from an innate "being", or personal character. [[Martin Heidegger|Heidegger]] coined the term "''[[dasein]]''" for this property of being in his influential work ''[[Being and Time]]'' ("this entity which each of us is himself…we shall denote by the term 'dasein.'"&lt;ref name="dasein1"/&gt;), in which he argued that being or ''dasein'' links one's sense of one's body to one's perception of [[world]]. Heidegger, amongst others, referred to an innate language as the foundation of being, which gives [[Information|signal]] to all aspects of being.

Lee was born in [[Chinatown, San Francisco]], on November 27, 1940, to parents from [[Hong Kong]], and was raised with his family in [[Kowloon]], Hong Kong. He was introduced to the film industry by his father and appeared in several films as a child actor. Lee moved to the United States at the age of 18 to receive his higher education at the [[University of Washington]] in [[Seattle]],&lt;ref name="TheBruceLeeStory41"&gt;{{harvnb|Lee|1989|p=41}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it was during this time that he began teaching martial arts. His [[Cinema of Hong Kong|Hong Kong]] and [[Hollywood]]-produced films elevated the traditional [[Hong Kong action cinema|Hong Kong martial arts film]] to a new level of popularity and acclaim, sparking a surge of interest in [[Chinese martial arts]] in the West in the 1970s.

==Early life==

[[File:Bruce Lee with his parents 1940s.jpg|thumb|left|Bruce Lee as a baby with his parents]]

Bruce Lee was born on November 27, 1940, at the [[San Francisco Chinese Hospital|Chinese Hospital]], in [[San Francisco]]'s [[Chinatown, San Francisco|Chinatown]]. According to the [[Chinese zodiac]], Lee was born in both the hour and the year of the [[Dragon (zodiac)|Dragon]], which according to tradition is a strong and fortuitous omen.&lt;ref name="bruceleefoundation biography"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bruceleefoundation.com/index.cfm/page/About-Bruce-Lee/pid/10378 |title=Biography |publisher=Bruce Lee Foundation |accessdate=June 7, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100822035902/http://www.bruceleefoundation.com/index.cfm/page/About-Bruce-Lee/pid/10378 |archivedate=August 22, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Lee and his parents returned to Hong Kong when he was three months old.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bruce-lee.ws/about_bruce_lee.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050312163628/http://www.bruce-lee.ws/about_bruce_lee.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=March 12, 2005 |title=Bruce Lee: Biography |publisher=Bruce-lee.ws |accessdate=January 22, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bruce's father, [[Lee Hoi-chuen]] was [[Han Chinese]], and his mother, Grace Ho (何愛瑜), was of [[Eurasian (mixed ancestry)|Eurasian]] ancestry.&lt;ref&gt;Description of the parent's racial makeup as described by Robert Lee at minute mark 3:35 in the cable television documentary, ''First Families: Bruce Lee'', which premiered on Fox Family on October 26, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; Grace Ho was the adopted daughter of Ho Kom-tong (Ho Gumtong, 何甘棠) and the half-niece of [[Robert Ho|Sir Robert Ho-tung]], both notable Hong Kong [[businessman|businessmen]] and [[philanthropist]]s.&lt;ref name="People's Republic of China"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lcsd.gov.hk/ce/Museum/Monument/form/147meeting/AAB-46%20Annex%20B.pdf |title=Kom Tong Hall at 7 Castle Road, Mid-levels, Hong Kong |publisher=People's Republic of China |accessdate=September 12, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110612034159/http://www.lcsd.gov.hk/ce/Museum/Monument/form/147meeting/AAB-46%20Annex%20B.pdf |archivedate=June 12, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bruce was the fourth of five children: Phoebe Lee (李秋源), Agnes Lee (李秋鳳), Peter Lee (李忠琛), and [[Robert Lee (musician)|Robert Lee]] (李振輝).

Grace's parentage remains unclear. Linda Lee, in her 1989 biography ''The Bruce Lee Story'', suggests that Grace had a [[German people|German]] father and was a [[Catholicism|Catholic]].&lt;ref name="harvnb|Lee|1989"&gt;{{harvnb|Lee|1989|}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bruce Thomas, in his influential 1994 biography ''Bruce Lee: Fighting Spirit'', suggests that Grace had a Chinese mother and a German father.&lt;ref name="Russo"&gt;{{cite news |last=Russo |first=Charles |date=May 18, 2016 |title=Was Bruce Lee of English Descent? |url=http://fightland.vice.com/blog/was-bruce-lee-of-english-descent |work=VICE Fightland |location= |access-date= |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161025083142/http://fightland.vice.com/blog/was-bruce-lee-of-english-descent |archivedate=October 25, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Lee's relative Eric Peter Ho, in his 2010 book ''Tracing My Children’s Lineage'', suggests that Grace was born in [[Shanghai]] to a [[Eurasian (mixed ancestry)|Eurasian]] woman named Cheung King-sin.&lt;ref name="Russo"/&gt; Eric Peter Ho said that Grace Lee was the daughter of a mixed race Shanghainese woman and her father was Ho Kom Tong.

However, in his 2018 biography, ''Bruce Lee; A Life'', [[Matthew Polly]] identifies Bruce's Lee's mother's grandfather as Moses Hartog Bosman.  Born to a [[Jewish]] family in [[Rotterdam]], Bosman became a successful businessman in Hong Kong, where he had a Chinese concubine named Sze Tai with whom he had six children, including Lee's grandfather Ho Kom Tong.

===Names===
[[File:Bruce Lee and his family 1940s.jpg|thumb|Bruce Lee and his family, when he was a child.]]

Lee's [[Cantonese people|Cantonese]] birth name was ''[[Li (李)|Lee]] Jun-fan'' (李振藩).&lt;ref name=Bio-TBLS&gt;振藩; Mandarin [[Pinyin]]: Zhènfán){{harvnb|Lee|1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name homophonically means "return again", and was given to Lee by his mother, who felt he would return to the United States once he came of age.&lt;ref name="TheBruceLeeStory20"&gt;{{harvnb|Lee|1989|p=20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of his mother's superstitious nature, she had originally named him ''Sai-fon'' (細鳳), which is a feminine name meaning "small [[Phoenix (mythology)|phoenix]]".&lt;ref name="Bruce Lee 2002"/&gt; The English name "Bruce" is thought to have been given by the hospital attending physician, Dr. Mary Glover.&lt;ref name=Bio-BLTUS&gt;{{cite book|title=Bruce Lee The Untold Story|first=Grace|last=Lee|publisher=CFW Enterprise|location=United States|year=1980}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lee had three other Chinese names: '''Lee Yuen-cham''' (李源鑫), a family/clan name; '''Lee Yuen-kam''' (李元鑒), which he used as a student name while he was attending [[La Salle College]], and his Chinese screen name '''Lee Siu-lung''' (李小龍; ''Siu-lung'' means "little dragon"). Lee's given name '''Jun-fan''' was originally written in Chinese as 震藩, however, the ''Jun'' (震) [[Chinese character]] was identical to part of his grandfather's name, Lee Jun-biu (李震彪). Hence, the Chinese character for ''Jun'' in Lee's name was changed to the [[homonym]] 振 instead, to avoid [[naming taboo]] in Chinese tradition.

===Family===
Lee's father, [[Lee Hoi-chuen]], was one of the leading [[Cantonese opera]] and film actors at the time and was embarking on a year-long opera tour with his family on the eve of the [[Battle of Hong Kong|Japanese invasion of Hong Kong]]. Lee Hoi-chuen had been touring the United States for many years and performing in numerous Chinese communities there.

Although many of his peers decided to stay in the US, Lee Hoi-chuen returned to Hong Kong after Bruce's birth. Within months, Hong Kong was invaded and the Lees lived for three years and eight months under [[Japanese occupation of Hong Kong|Japanese occupation]]. After the war ended, Lee Hoi-chuen resumed his acting career and became a more popular actor during Hong Kong's rebuilding years.

Lee's mother, Grace Ho, was from one of the wealthiest and most powerful clans in Hong Kong, the Ho-tungs. She was the half-niece of [[Robert Ho|Sir Robert Ho-tung]],&lt;ref name="People's Republic of China"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lcsd.gov.hk/CE/Museum/History/en/pspecial_8.php |title=Kom Tong Hall and the Dr Sun Yat-sen Museum |date=January 10, 2005 |publisher=People's Republic of China |accessdate=September 12, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100818100840/http://www.lcsd.gov.hk/CE/Museum/History/en/pspecial_8.php |archivedate=August 18, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; the Eurasian patriarch of the clan. As such, the young Bruce Lee grew up in an affluent and privileged environment. Despite the advantage of his family's status, the neighborhood in which Lee grew up became overcrowded, dangerous, and full of gang rivalries due to an influx of refugees fleeing [[China|communist China]] for Hong Kong, at that time a British [[Crown colony]].&lt;ref name="Bruce Lee 2002"&gt;Bruce Lee: the immortal Dragon, January 29, 2002, A&amp;E Television Networks&lt;/ref&gt;

After Lee was involved in several street fights, his parents decided that he needed to be trained in the martial arts. Lee's first introduction to martial arts was through his father, from whom he learned the fundamentals of [[Wu-style t'ai chi ch'uan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Thomas|1994|p=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wing Chun===
{{See also|History of Wing Chun}}
[[File:Before 18 years old Bruce Lee.jpg|thumb|Lee, before the age of 18]]

The largest influence on Lee's martial arts development was his study of [[Wing Chun]]. Lee began training in Wing Chun when he was 16 years old under the Wing Chun teacher [[Yip Man]] in 1957, after losing several fights with rival gang members. Yip's regular classes generally consisted of the forms practice, ''chi sao'' (sticking hands) drills, [[Muk Yan Jong|wooden dummy]] techniques, and free-sparring.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;''Black Belt: Bruce Lee Collector's Edition'' Summer 1993&lt;/ref&gt; There was no set pattern to the classes.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Yip tried to keep his students from fighting in the street gangs of Hong Kong by encouraging them to fight in organized competitions.&lt;ref&gt;''Black Belt: Bruce Lee Collector's Edition'' Summer 1993, p. 18&lt;/ref&gt;

After a year into his Wing Chun training, most of Yip Man's other students refused to train with Lee when they learned of his mixed ancestry, as the Chinese were generally against teaching their martial arts techniques to non-Asians.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Thomas|1994|p=26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sharif|2009|p=56}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lee's sparring partner, Hawkins Cheung, states, "Probably fewer than six people in the whole Wing Chun clan were personally taught, or even partly taught, by Yip Man".&lt;ref&gt;Black Belt: Bruce Lee Collector's Edition Summer 1993 p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; However, Lee showed a keen interest in Wing Chun and continued to train privately with Yip Man and [[Wong Shun Leung]] in 1955.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Campbell|2006|p=172}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Wan Kam Leung]], a student of Wong's, witnessed a sparring bout between Wong and Lee and noted the speed and precision with which Lee was able to deliver his kicks.&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|LjuYLc4kt7w|Wan Kam Leung recalls Bruce lee fighting with Wong Shun Leung}} (25 July 2009). Retrieved 8 May 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Lee continued to train with Wong Shun Leung after returning to Hong Kong from America.

===Leaving Hong Kong===
[[File:The age of 18 Bruce Lee and Ye Wen.jpg|thumb|left|Lee and his teacher Yip Man]]

After attending Tak Sun School (德信學校) (several blocks from his home at 218 Nathan Road, [[Kowloon]]), Lee entered the primary school division of the [[Catholic school|Catholic]] [[La Salle College]] at the age of 12. In 1956, due to poor academic performance and possibly poor conduct, he was transferred to [[St. Francis Xavier's College]] (high school), where he would be mentored by Brother Edward, a teacher and coach of the school boxing team. In 1958, Bruce won the Hong Kong schools boxing tournament, knocking out the previous champion in the final.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas 1994, pp29-30&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bruce Lee in 1958.jpg|thumb|Lee in 1958, dancing Cha-cha]]
In the spring of 1959, Lee got into another street fight, and the police were called.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Until his late teens, Lee's street fights became more frequent and included beating the son of a feared [[Triad (underground society)|triad]] family.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} Eventually, Lee's father decided his son should leave Hong Kong to pursue a safer and healthier life in the United States. His parents confirmed the police's fear that this time Lee's opponent had an [[organised crime|organized crime]] background and that there was the possibility that a contract was out for his life.

In April 1959, Lee's parents decided to send him to the United States to stay with his older sister, Agnes Lee (李秋鳳), who was already living with family friends in San Francisco.

At the age of 18, Lee returned to the United States. After living in San Francisco for several months, he moved to [[Seattle]] in 1959 to continue his high school education, where he also worked for [[Ruby Chow]] as a live-in waiter at her restaurant.

Chow's husband was a co-worker and friend of Lee's father. Lee's elder brother Peter Lee (李忠琛) would also join him in Seattle for a short stay before moving on to [[Minnesota]] to attend college. In December 1960, Lee completed his high school education and received his diploma from Edison Technical School (now [[Seattle Central Community College]], located on [[Capitol Hill (Seattle)|Capitol Hill]] in Seattle).

In March 1961, Lee enrolled at the [[University of Washington]] and studied dramatic arts, [[philosophy]], [[psychology]], and various other subjects.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Little|2001|p=32}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Thomas|1994|p=42}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Despite what Lee himself and many others have stated, Lee's official major was drama rather than philosophy according to a 1999 article in the university's alumni publication,.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.washington.edu/alumni/columns/dec99/j_o.html |title=U. of Washington alumni records |publisher=Washington.edu |accessdate=January 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He soon met his future wife [[Linda Lee Cadwell|Linda Emery]], a fellow student studying to become a teacher, whom he married in August 1964.

Lee had two children with Linda Emery: [[Brandon Lee]] (1965–1993) and [[Shannon Lee]] (born 1969).

==Martial arts career==

===Jun Fan Gung Fu===
Lee began teaching martial arts in the United States in 1959. He called what he taught Jun Fan Gung Fu (literally Bruce Lee's Kung Fu).

Lee dropped out of college in the spring of 1964 and moved to [[Oakland, California|Oakland]] to live with [[James Yimm Lee]] (嚴鏡海). James Lee was twenty years senior to Bruce Lee and a well-known Chinese martial artist in the area. Together, they founded the second Jun Fan martial arts studio in Oakland. James Lee was also responsible for introducing Bruce Lee to [[Ed Parker]], an American martial artist and organizer of the [[Long Beach International Karate Championships]] where Bruce Lee was later "discovered" by Hollywood.

Without retracting his right arm, Lee then forcibly delivered the punch to his partner while largely maintaining his posture, sending the partner backwards and falling into a chair said to be placed behind the partner to prevent injury, though his partner's momentum soon caused him to fall to the floor. His volunteer was Bob Baker of [[Stockton, California|Stockton]], California. "I told Bruce not to do this type of demonstration again", Baker recalled. "When he punched me that last time, I had to stay home from work because the pain in my chest was unbearable".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Vaughn|1986|p=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was at the 1964 championships that Lee first met [[Taekwondo]] master [[Jhoon Goo Rhee]]. The two developed a friendship&amp;nbsp;– a relationship from which they benefited as martial artists. Rhee taught Lee the [[side kick]] in detail, and Lee taught Rhee the "non-telegraphic" punch.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last = Nilsson|first = Thomas|date=May 1996|title = With Bruce Lee: Taekwondo Pioneer Jhoon Rhee Recounts His 10-Year Friendship With the "Dragon"|magazine = [[Black Belt Magazine]]|volume = 34|issue = 5|pages = 39–43|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=H9oDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA39&amp;lpg=PA39#v=onepage|accessdate =November 19, 2009}}

{{anchor|unstoppable}}
Lee appeared at the 1967 [[Long Beach International Karate Championships]] and performed various demonstrations, including the famous "unstoppable punch" against USKA world [[Karate]] champion [[Vic Moore]].&lt;ref name="ikc" /&gt; Lee allegedly told Moore that he was going to throw a straight punch to the face, and all he had to do was to try to block it. Lee took several steps back and asked if Moore was ready. When Moore nodded in affirmation, Lee glided towards him until he was within striking range. He then threw a straight punch directly at Moore's face, and stopped before impact. In eight attempts, Moore failed to block any of the punches.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Uyehara|1993|p=27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cbt9Xfs1-bo|title=Bruce Lee Victor Moore unblockable closing Long Beach International Tournament 60s|publisher=YouTube|date=June 11, 2009|accessdate=February 24, 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130726040700/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cbt9Xfs1-bo|archivedate=July 26, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Moore and grandmaster Steve Mohammed claim that Lee had first told Moore that he was going to throw a straight punch to the body, which Moore blocked. Lee attempted another punch, and Moore blocked it as well. The third punch, which Lee threw to Moore's face, did not come nearly within striking distance. Moore claims that Lee never successfully struck Moore but Moore was able to strike Lee after trying on his own. Moore further claims that Bruce Lee said he was the fastest American he's ever seen and that Lee's media crew repeatedly played the one punch towards Moore's face that did not come within striking range, allegedly in an attempt to preserve Lee's superstar image. However, when viewing the video of the demonstration, it is clear that Mohammed and especially Moore were erroneous in their claims.&lt;ref&gt;Vic Moore as interviewed in {{citeweb|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nik8VQAcuGE|title=GrandMaster Vic Moore: The Man That Fought 'Em ALL!!!|accessdate=May 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fight with Wong Jack Man===
In [[Oakland, California|Oakland's]] [[Chinatown, Oakland|Chinatown]] in 1964, Lee had a controversial private match with [[Wong Jack Man]], a direct student of Ma Kin Fung, known for his mastery of [[Xingyiquan]], [[Northern Shaolin (martial art)|Northern Shaolin]], and [[T'ai chi ch'uan]]. According to Lee, the Chinese community issued an ultimatum to him to stop teaching non-Chinese people. When he refused to comply, he was challenged to a combat match with Wong. The arrangement was that if Lee lost, he would have to shut down his school, while if he won, he would be free to teach white people, or anyone else.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;''Bruce Lee: The Immortal Dragon'', January 29, 2002, A&amp;E Television Networks&lt;/ref&gt; Wong denied this, stating that he requested to fight Lee after Lee boasted during one of his demonstrations at a Chinatown theatre that he could beat anyone in San Francisco, and that Wong himself did not discriminate against Whites or other non-Chinese people.&lt;ref name="Dorgan"&gt;{{harvnb|Dorgan|1980|p=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lee commented, "That paper had all the names of the [[sifu]] from Chinatown, but they don't scare me".&lt;ref&gt;''Black Belt: Bruce Lee Collector's Edition'', Summer 1993 Rainbow Publications Inc, p. 117&lt;/ref&gt;

Individuals known to have witnessed the match include Cadwell, James Lee (Bruce Lee's associate, no relation), and William Chen, a teacher of T'ai chi ch'uan. Wong and William Chen stated that the fight lasted an unusually long 20–25 minutes.&lt;ref name="Dorgan"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mental Floss"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mentalfloss.com/article/67108/time-bruce-lee-was-challenged-real-fight|title=Bruce Lee: The Time Bruce Lee Was Challenged to a Real Fight|last=Rossen|first=Jake|date=August 10, 2015|work=Mental Floss|accessdate=July 10, 2016|location=New York, NY}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wong claims that although he had originally expected a serious but polite bout, Lee aggressively attacked him with intent to kill. When Wong presented the traditional handshake, Lee appeared to accept the greeting, but instead, Lee immediately thrust his hand as a spear aimed at Wong's eyes. Forced to defend his life, Wong nonetheless refrained from striking Lee with killing force when the opportunity presented itself because it could have earned him a prison sentence. The fight ended due to Lee's "unusually winded" condition, as opposed to a decisive blow by either fighter.&lt;ref name="Dorgan"/&gt; By contrast, according to Bruce Lee, [[Linda Lee Cadwell]], and [[James Yimm Lee]], the fight lasted a mere 3 minutes with a decisive victory for Lee. In Cadwell's account, "The fight ensued, it was a no-holds-barred fight, it took three minutes. Bruce got this guy down to the ground and said 'Do you give up?' and the man said he gave up".&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

A couple of weeks after the bout, Lee gave an interview claiming that he had defeated an unnamed challenger, which Wong says was an obvious reference to him.&lt;ref name = "Dorgan"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mental Floss"/&gt; In response, Wong published his own account of the fight in the Chinese ''Pacific Weekly'', a [[Chinese-language]] newspaper in San Francisco, with an invitation to a public rematch if Lee was not satisfied with the account. Lee did not respond to the invitation despite his reputation for violently responding to every provocation,&lt;ref name = "Dorgan"/&gt; and there were no further public announcements by either, though Lee continued to teach white people.

===Jeet Kune Do===
[[File:JeetKuneDo.svg|thumb|The [[Jeet Kune Do]] emblem is a registered trademark held by the Bruce Lee Estate. The [[Chinese character]]s around the [[Taijitu]] symbol read: "Using no way as way" and "Having no limitation as limitation" The arrows represent the endless interaction between yang and yin.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bishop|2004|p=23}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
{{Main|Jeet Kune Do}}
Jeet Kune Do originated in 1967. After filming one season of ''[[The Green Hornet (TV series)|The Green Hornet]]'', Lee found himself out of work and opened The Jun Fan Gung Fu Institute. The controversial match with Wong Jack Man influenced Lee's philosophy about martial arts. Lee concluded that the fight had lasted too long and that he had failed to live up to his potential using his [[Wing Chun]] techniques. He took the view that traditional martial arts techniques were too rigid and formalized to be practical in scenarios of chaotic [[street fighting]]. Lee decided to develop a system with an emphasis on "practicality, flexibility, speed, and efficiency". He started to use different methods of training such as [[weight training]] for strength, running for endurance, stretching for flexibility, and many others which he constantly adapted, including [[fencing]] and basic [[boxing]] techniques.

Lee emphasized what he called "the style of no style". This consisted of getting rid of the formalized approach which Lee claimed was indicative of traditional styles. Lee felt that even the system he now called Jun Fan Gung Fu was too restrictive, and it eventually evolved into a philosophy and martial art he would come to call ''Jeet Kune Do'' or the ''Way of the Intercepting Fist.'' It is a term he would later regret, because Jeet Kune Do implied specific parameters that styles connote, whereas the idea of his martial art was to exist outside of parameters and limitations.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Thomas|1994|p=81}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fitness and nutrition===
At {{convert|172|cm|ftin|abbr=on}} and weighing {{convert|64|kg|lb|abbr=on}} at the time,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bruce Lee|url=http://www.china.org.cn/top10/chinese_celebrities_vote/2012-08/28/content_26356156.htm|website=china.org.cn|accessdate=July 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lee was renowned for his physical fitness and vigor, achieved by using a dedicated fitness regimen to become as strong as possible. After his match with [[Wong Jack Man]] in 1965, Lee changed his approach toward martial arts training. Lee felt that many martial artists of his time did not spend enough time on physical conditioning. Lee included all elements of total fitness—muscular strength, muscular endurance, cardiovascular endurance, and flexibility. He used traditional [[bodybuilding]] techniques to build some muscle mass, though not overdone, as that could decrease speed or flexibility. At the same time, with respect to balance, Lee maintained that mental and spiritual preparation are fundamental to the success of physical training in martial arts skills. In ''[[Tao of Jeet Kune Do]]'' he wrote:

{{quote|Training is one of the most neglected phases of athletics. Too much time is given to the development of skill and too little to the development of the individual for participation.&amp;nbsp;... JKD, ultimately is not a matter of petty techniques but of highly developed spirituality and physique.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=May 30, 2008 |url=http://www.hybridmartialart.com/Martial%20Art%20Overview/Martial_%20Arts_%20Overview.html |title=Martial Art Disciplines at Hybrid Martial Arts Academy |publisher=Hybrid Martial Art |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080430001936/http://www.hybridmartialart.com/Martial%20Art%20Overview/Martial_%20Arts_%20Overview.html |archivedate=April 30, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

According to [[Linda Lee Cadwell]], soon after he moved to the United States, Lee started to take nutrition seriously and developed an interest in health foods, high-protein drinks, and vitamin and mineral supplements. He later concluded that achieving a high-performance body was akin to maintaining the engine of a high-performance automobile. Allegorically, as one could not keep a car running on low-octane fuels, one could not sustain one's body with a steady diet of junk food, and with "the wrong fuel", one's body would perform sluggishly or sloppily.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Little|1998|p=162}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lee also avoided baked goods and refined flour, describing them as providing empty calories that did nothing for his body.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Little|1998|p=163}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was known for being a fan of Asian cuisine for its variety, and often ate meals with a combination of vegetables, rice, and fish, and drank fresh milk.

==Acting career==
{{main|Bruce Lee filmography}}
[[Image:Bruce Lee 1950.jpg|left|thumb|250px|Bruce Lee in ''[[The Kid (1950 film)|The Kid]]'']]
Lee's father [[Lee Hoi-chuen]] was a famous [[Cantonese opera]] star. Because of this, Lee was introduced into films at a very young age and appeared in several films as a child. Lee had his first role as a baby who was carried onto the stage in the film ''[[Golden Gate Girl]]''. By the time he was 18, he had appeared in twenty films.&lt;ref name="bruceleefoundation biography"/&gt;

While in the United States from 1959 to 1964, Lee abandoned thoughts of a film career in favour of pursuing martial arts. However, a martial arts exhibition on Long Beach in 1964 eventually led to the invitation by [[William Dozier]] for an audition for a role in the pilot for "Number One Son". The show never aired, but Lee was invited for the role of the sidekick [[Kato (The Green Hornet)|Kato]] alongside the title character played by [[Van Williams]] in the TV series titled ''[[The Green Hornet (TV series)|The Green Hornet]]''. The show lasted only one season of 26 episodes, from September 1966 to March 1967. Lee and Williams also appeared as their respective characters in three [[crossover (fiction)|crossover]] episodes of ''[[Batman (TV series)|Batman]]'', another William Dozier-produced television series. This was followed by guest appearances in three television series: ''[[Ironside (TV series)|Ironside]]'' (1967), ''[[Here Come the Brides]]'' (1969), and ''Blondie'' (1969).

At the time, two of Lee's martial arts students were Hollywood script writer [[Stirling Silliphant]] and actor [[James Coburn]]. In 1969 the three worked on a script for a film called ''The Silent Flute'', and went together on a location hunt to [[India]]. The project was not realised at the time, but the 1978 film ''[[Circle of Iron]]'', starring [[David Carradine]], was based on the same plot. In 2010, producer Paul Maslansky was reported to have planned and received funding for a film based on the original script for ''The Silent Flute''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=McNary |first=Dave |url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118017805.html?categoryid=13&amp;cs=1 |title=Bruce Lee's 'Flute' heads to bigscreen&amp;nbsp;– Entertainment News, Film News, Media |publisher=Variety |date=April 15, 2010 |accessdate=February 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1969, Lee made a brief appearance in the Silliphant-penned film ''[[Marlowe (film)|Marlowe]]'', where he played a henchman hired to intimidate private detective [[Philip Marlowe]], (played by [[James Garner]]), by smashing up his office with leaping kicks and flashing punches, only to later accidentally jump off a tall building while trying to kick Marlowe off. The same year he also choreographed fight scenes for ''[[The Wrecking Crew (1969 film)|The Wrecking Crew]]'' starring [[Dean Martin]], [[Sharon Tate]], and featuring [[Chuck Norris]] in his first role. In 1970, he was responsible for fight choreography for ''[[A Walk in the Spring Rain]]'' starring [[Ingrid Bergman]] and [[Anthony Quinn]], again written by Silliphant. In 1971, Lee appeared in four episodes of the television series ''[[Longstreet (TV series)|Longstreet]]'', written by Silliphant. Lee played the martial arts instructor of the title character Mike Longstreet (played by [[James Franciscus]]), and important aspects of his martial arts philosophy were written into the script.

According to statements made by Lee, and also by [[Linda Lee Cadwell]] after Lee's death, in 1971 Lee pitched a television series of his own tentatively titled [[Warrior (TV series)|''The Warrior'']], discussions of which were also confirmed by [[Warner Bros.]] During a December 9, 1971 television interview on ''[[The Pierre Berton Show]]'', Lee stated that both Paramount and Warner Brothers wanted him "to be in a modernized type of a thing, and that they think the Western idea is out, whereas I want to do the Western".&lt;ref&gt;From {{YouTube|hN8PfMdBIjw|The Pierre Berton Show}} December 9, 1971 (comments at 7:10 of part 2)&lt;/ref&gt; According to Cadwell, however, Lee's concept was retooled and renamed ''[[Kung Fu (TV series)|Kung Fu]]'', but [[Warner Bros.]] gave Lee no credit.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lee|1975a|p=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Warner Brothers states that they had for some time been developing an identical concept,&lt;ref&gt;Bleecker, Tom (1996). Unsettled Matters. The Life &amp; Death of Bruce Lee. Gilderoy Publications&lt;/ref&gt; created by two writers and producers, Ed Spielman and Howard Friedlander. According to these sources, the reason Lee was not cast was in part because of his ethnicity, but more so because he had a thick accent.&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|PlYdp1BVOlw|"From Grasshopper to Caine"}}&lt;/ref&gt; The role of the [[Shaolin Kung Fu|Shaolin]] monk in the [[American Old West|Wild West]] was eventually awarded to then-non-martial-artist David Carradine. In ''The Pierre Berton Show'' interview, Lee stated he understood Warner Brothers' attitudes towards casting in the series: "They think that business-wise it is a risk. I don't blame them. If the situation were reversed, and an American star were to come to Hong Kong, and I was the man with the money, I would have my own concerns as to whether the acceptance would be there".&lt;ref&gt;From {{YouTube|uXOtmhA6Nvw|The Pierre Berton Show}} December 9, 1971 (comments near end of part 2 &amp; early in part 3)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hong Kong films and stardom===
Producer Fred Weintraub had advised Lee to return to Hong Kong and make a feature film which he could showcase to executives in Hollywood.&lt;ref&gt;Tale of the Dragon (Channel 4), directed by Jess Search&lt;/ref&gt; Not happy with his supporting roles in the US, Lee returned to Hong Kong. Unaware that ''[[The Green Hornet (TV series)|The Green Hornet]]'' had been played to success in Hong Kong and was unofficially referred to as "The Kato Show", he was surprised to be recognized on the street as the star of the show. After negotiating with both [[Shaw Brothers Studio]] and [[Orange Sky Golden Harvest|Golden Harvest]], Lee signed a film contract to star in two films produced by Golden Harvest.

Lee played his first leading role in ''[[The Big Boss]]'' (1971), which proved to be an enormous box office success across Asia and catapulted him to stardom. He soon followed up with ''[[Fist of Fury]]'' (1972), which broke the box office records set previously by ''The Big Boss''. Having finished his initial two-year contract, Lee negotiated a new deal with Golden Harvest. Lee later formed his own company, [[Concord Production Inc.]] (協和電影公司), with Chow. For his third film, ''[[Way of the Dragon]]'' (1972), he was given complete control of the film's production as the writer, director, star, and [[Stage combat|choreographer]] of the fight scenes. In 1964, at a demonstration in [[Long Beach, California|Long Beach]], California, Lee had met [[karate]] champion Chuck Norris. In ''Way of the Dragon'' Lee introduced Norris to moviegoers as his opponent in the final death fight at the [[Colosseum]] in Rome, today considered one of Lee's most legendary fight scenes and one of the most memorable fight scenes in [[martial arts film]] history.&lt;ref name="harvnb|Lee|1989"/&gt; The role had originally been offered to American karate champion [[Joe Lewis (martial artist)|Joe Lewis]].&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, B. (1994) Bruce Lee Fighting Spirit. Berkeley: Frog Ltd.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Avenue of Stars Bruce Lee.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Bruce Lee's star at the [[Avenue of Stars, Hong Kong]].]]
From August to October 1972, Lee began work on his fourth Golden Harvest Film, ''[[Game of Death]]''. He began filming some scenes, including his fight sequence with {{convert|7|ft|2|in|cm|abbr=on}} American basketball star [[Kareem Abdul-Jabbar]], a former student. Production stopped in November 1972 when Warner Brothers offered Lee the opportunity to star in ''[[Enter the Dragon]]'', the first film to be produced jointly by Concord, Golden Harvest, and Warner Bros. Filming began in Hong Kong in January 1973. One month into the filming, another production company, Starseas Motion Pictures, promoted Bruce Lee as a leading actor in ''Fist of Unicorn'', although he had merely agreed to choreograph the fight sequences in the film as a favour to his long-time friend [[Unicorn Chan]]. Lee planned to sue the production company, but retained his friendship with Chan.&lt;ref name="Thomas, B. 2003"&gt;Thomas, B. (2003) Bruce Lee Fighting Words. Berkeley: Frog Ltd.&lt;/ref&gt; However, only a few months after the completion of ''Enter the Dragon'', and six days before its July 26, 1973 release,&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|0070034|Enter the Dragon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lee died. ''Enter the Dragon'' would go on to become one of the year's highest-grossing films and cement Lee as a martial arts legend. It was made for US$850,000 in 1973 (equivalent to $4&amp;nbsp;million adjusted for inflation as of 2007).&lt;ref name=bls&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=May 30, 2008|url=http://data.bls.gov/cgi-bin/cpicalc.pl|title=Inflation Calculator|publisher=[[Bureau of Labor Statistics]]|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080529155647/http://data.bls.gov/cgi-bin/cpicalc.pl|archivedate=May 29, 2008|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; To date, ''Enter the Dragon'' has grossed over $200&amp;nbsp;million worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,991260-3,00.html|title=The Gladiator BRUCE LEE|last=Stein|first=Joel|work=TIME |date=June 14, 1999|page=3|accessdate=August 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film sparked a brief [[Fads and trends|fad]] in martial arts, epitomised in songs such as "[[Kung Fu Fighting]]" and TV shows like ''[[Kung Fu (TV series)|Kung Fu]]''.

[[Robert Clouse]], the director of ''Enter the Dragon'', together with Golden Harvest, revived Lee's unfinished film ''Game of Death''. Lee had shot over 100 minutes of footage, including out-takes, for ''Game of Death'' before shooting was stopped to allow him to work on ''Enter the Dragon''. In addition to Abdul-Jabbar, [[George Lazenby]], Hapkido master [[Ji Han-Jae]], and another of Lee's students, [[Dan Inosanto]], were also to appear in the film, which was to culminate in Lee's character, Hai Tien (clad in the now-famous yellow track suit&lt;ref&gt;Film producer [[Andre Morgan]], who worked with Lee on the set of ''Game of Death'', recalls that a choice had to be made from what was made available: a yellow suit or a black suit. The yellow suit was chosen because it allowed a footprint from a kick to be seen on film in a fighting scene with Kareem.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scmp.com/lifestyle/film-tv/article/1883903/truth-about-bruce-lees-yellow-jumpsuit Why Lee wore a yellow suit] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151128173750/http://www.scmp.com/lifestyle/film-tv/article/1883903/truth-about-bruce-lees-yellow-jumpsuit |date=November 28, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;) taking on a series of different challengers on each floor as they make their way through a five-level pagoda. In a controversial move, Robert Clouse finished the film using a [[look-alike]] and [[stock footage|archive footage]] of Lee from his other films with a new storyline and cast, which was released in 1978. However, the cobbled-together film contained only fifteen minutes of actual footage of Lee (he had printed many unsuccessful takes)&lt;ref&gt;''Bruce Lee, the Legend'', 1977, Paragon Films, Ltd., [[20th Century Fox Home Entertainment]]&lt;/ref&gt; while the rest had a Lee look-alike, [[Kim Tai Chung]], and [[Yuen Biao]] as stunt double. The unused footage Lee had filmed was recovered 22 years later and included in the documentary ''[[Bruce Lee: A Warrior's Journey]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|id=0297814|title=Bruce Lee: A Warrior's Journey}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Bruce Lee Walk of fame.jpg|thumb|left|Bruce Lee's star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]]]]
Apart from ''[[Game of Death]]'', other future film projects were planned to feature Lee at the time. In 1972, after the success of ''[[The Big Boss]]'' and ''[[Fist of Fury]]'', a third film was planned by [[Raymond Chow]] at [[Orange Sky Golden Harvest|Golden Harvest]] to be directed by [[Lo Wei]], titled ''Yellow-Faced Tiger''. However, at the time, Lee decided to direct and produce his own script for ''[[Way of the Dragon]]'' instead. Although Lee had formed a production company with Raymond Chow, a period film was also planned from September–November 1973 with the competing [[Shaw Brothers Studio]], to be directed by either [[Chor Yuen]] or Cheng Kang, and written by Yi Kang and [[Chang Cheh]], titled ''The Seven Sons of the Jade Dragon''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=January 6, 2011 |url=http://www.fortunecity.com/lavender/friday/155/id47.htm |title=Shaw Brothers Film Project |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111103162421/http://www.fortunecity.com/lavender/friday/155/id47.htm |archivedate=November 3, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Lee had also worked on several scripts himself. A tape containing a recording of Lee narrating the basic storyline to a film tentatively titled ''Southern Fist/Northern Leg'' exists, showing some similarities with the canned script for ''The Silent Flute'' (''[[Circle of Iron]]'').&lt;ref&gt;Bruce Lee The Man &amp; The Legend (Documentary, Golden Harvest, 1973)&lt;/ref&gt; Another script had the title ''Green Bamboo Warrior'', set in San Francisco, planned to co-star [[Bolo Yeung]] and to be produced by [[Andrew Vajna]] who later went on to produce ''[[First Blood]]''.&lt;ref name="Thomas, B. 2003"/&gt; Photoshoot costume tests were also organized for some of these planned film projects.

In 2015, Perfect Storm Entertainment and Bruce Lee's daughter, [[Shannon Lee]] announced that the series [[Warrior (TV series)|"The Warrior"]] would be produced and would air on the [[Cinemax]] and the [[filmmaker]] [[Justin Lin]] was chosen to direct the series.&lt;ref name="developing"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://deadline.com/2015/05/bruce-lee-crime-drama-warrior-justin-lin-cinemax-1201430580/|title=Cinemax Developing Bruce Lee-Inspired Crime Drama ‘Warrior’ From Justin Lin|first=Nellie|last=Andreeva|date=21 May 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Production began on October 22, 2017 in [[Cape Town]], [[South Africa]].

==Artistry==

===Philosophy===
Lee is best known as a martial artist, but he also studied drama and Asian and Western philosophy while a student at the [[University of Washington]] and throughout his life. He was well-read and had an extensive library dominated by martial arts subjects and philosophical texts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://houseofbrucelee.blogspot.tw/2012/08/books.html|title=INSIDE BRUCE LEE'S PERSONAL LIBRARY|website=houseofbrucelee.blogspot.tw}}&lt;/ref&gt; His own books on martial arts and fighting philosophy are known for their philosophical assertions, both inside and outside of martial arts circles. His [[Eclecticism|eclectic]] philosophy often mirrored his fighting beliefs, though he was quick to claim that his martial arts were solely a metaphor for such teachings. He believed that any knowledge ultimately led to self-knowledge, and said that his chosen method of self-expression was martial arts.&lt;ref name="warriorwithin122"/&gt; His influences include [[Taoism]], [[Jiddu Krishnamurti]], and [[Buddhism]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Bruce Lee: A Warrior's Journey]] at 31m45s&lt;/ref&gt; Lee's philosophy was very much in opposition to the conservative worldview advocated by [[Confucianism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bolelli|2008|p=161}}&lt;/ref&gt; John Little states that Lee was an [[Atheism|atheist]]. When asked in 1972 about his religious affiliation, he replied, "none whatsoever",&lt;ref name="warriorwithin128"&gt;{{harvnb|Little|1996|p=128}}&lt;/ref&gt; and when asked if he believed in God, he said, "To be perfectly frank, I really do not."&lt;ref name="warriorwithin122"&gt;{{harvnb|Little|1996|p=122}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aside from [[martial arts]] and philosophy, which focus on the physical aspect and self-consciousness for truths and principles,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lee|first=Bruce|title=The Warrior Within|year=1996|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=Martial arts-Philosophy|isbn=0-8092-3194-8|editor=John Little}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lee also wrote poetry that reflected his emotion and a stage in his life collectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lee|first=Bruce|title=Bruce Lee Artist of Life|year=1999|publisher=Tuttle|isbn=978-0-8048-3263-2|pages=93–116|author2=Linda Lee Cadwell|editor=John Little|type=Book}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many forms of art remain concordant with the artist creating them. Lee's principle of self-expression was applied to his poetry as well. His daughter Shannon Lee said, "He did write poetry; he was really the consummate artist."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lee |first=Shannon |title=Bruce Lee's Poetry: Shannon Lee reads one of her father's handwritten poems |url=http://www.brucelee.com/index.cfm/page/Bruce-Lee-s-Poetry---Shannon-Lee-reads-one-of-her-father-s-handwritten-poems/pid/10277/cdid/10363 |work=Poetry |accessdate=April 17, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121106192413/https://www.brucelee.com/index.cfm/page/Bruce-Lee-s-Poetry---Shannon-Lee-reads-one-of-her-father-s-handwritten-poems/pid/10277/cdid/10363 |archivedate=November 6, 2012 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; His poetic works were originally handwritten on paper, then later on edited and published, with John Little being the major author (editor), for Bruce Lee's works. Linda Lee Cadwell (Bruce Lee's wife) shared her husband's notes, poems, and experiences with followers. She mentioned "Lee's poems are, by American standards, rather dark--reflecting the deeper, less exposed recesses of the human psyche".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lee|first=Bruce|title=Bruce Lee Artist of Life|year=1999|publisher=Tuttle|location=Martial Arts|isbn=978-0-8048-3263-2|page=92|author2=Linda Lee Cadwell|editor=John Little|type=Book|chapter=Part 4 Poetry}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of Bruce Lee's poems are categorized as [[anti-poetry]] or fall into a [[paradox]]. The mood in his poems shows the side of the man that can be compared with other poets such as [[Robert Frost]], one of many well-known poets expressing himself with dark poetic works. The paradox taken from the [[Yin and Yang]] symbol in martial arts was also integrated into his poetry. His martial arts and philosophy contribute a great part to his poetry. The [[free verse]] form of Lee's poetry reflects his famous quote "Be formless … shapeless, like water."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Warrior Within|year=1996|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=Martial arts-Philosophy|isbn=0-8092-3194-8|page=43|author=John Little|editor=John Little|type=Book|chapter=Five: The Running Water}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
[[File:Bruce Lee 1.JPG|thumb|Bruce Lee is buried next to his son [[Brandon Lee|Brandon]] at [[Lake View Cemetery (Seattle)|Lake View Cemetery]] in [[Seattle]].]] 
On May 10, 1973, Lee collapsed during an [[automated dialogue replacement]] session for ''[[Enter the Dragon]]'' at [[Orange Sky Golden Harvest|Golden Harvest]] in Hong Kong. Suffering from [[Epileptic seizure|seizures]] and headaches, he was immediately rushed to [[Hong Kong Baptist Hospital]], where doctors diagnosed [[cerebral edema]]. They were able to reduce the swelling through the administration of [[mannitol]]. The headache and cerebral edema that occurred in his first collapse were later repeated on the day of his death.&lt;ref name="collapse"&gt;{{harvnb|Thomas|1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 20, 1973, Lee was in Hong Kong, to have dinner with actor [[George Lazenby]], with whom he intended to make a film. According to Lee's wife Linda, Lee met producer [[Raymond Chow]] at 2&amp;nbsp;p.m. at home to discuss the making of the film ''[[Game of Death]]''. They worked until 4&amp;nbsp;p.m. and then drove together to the home of Lee's colleague [[Betty Ting Pei]], a Taiwanese actress. The three went over the script at Ting's home, and then Chow left to attend a dinner meeting.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Campbell|2006|p=205}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lee|1989|pp=156–157}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, Lee complained of a headache, and Ting gave him an [[analgesic]], [[Equagesic]], which contained both [[aspirin]] and the tranquilizer [[meprobamate]]. Around 7:30&amp;nbsp;p.m., he went to lie down for a nap. When Lee did not come for dinner, producer Raymond Chow came to the apartment, but he was unable to wake Lee up. A doctor was summoned, and spent ten minutes attempting to revive Lee before sending him by ambulance to [[Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Hong Kong|Queen Elizabeth Hospital]]. Lee was declared [[dead on arrival]], at the age of 32.

There was no visible external injury; however, according to autopsy reports, Lee's brain had swollen considerably, from 1,400 to 1,575 grams (a 13% increase). The autopsy found Equagesic in his system. On October 15, 2005, Chow stated in an interview that Lee died from an allergic reaction to the tranquilizer meprobamate, the main ingredient in Equagesic, which Chow described as an ingredient commonly used in painkillers. When the doctors announced Lee's death, it was officially ruled a "[[death by misadventure]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Campbell|2006|p=206}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.hindu.com/2006/02/26/stories/2006022605431400.htm |title=Bruce Lee died of seizure? |work=The Hindu |location=India |date=February 26, 2006 |accessdate=June 3, 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110829185520/http://www.hindu.com/2006/02/26/stories/2006022605431400.htm |archivedate=August 29, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

These included murder involving the [[Triad (underground society)|triads]] and a supposed curse on him and his family.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bishop|2004|p=157}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Donald Teare]], a forensic scientist, recommended by [[Scotland Yard]], who had overseen over 1,000 autopsies, was assigned to the Lee case. His conclusion was "death by misadventure" caused by an acute [[cerebral edema]] due to a reaction to compounds present in the combination medication Equagesic.&lt;ref name="Thomas 1994 209"&gt;{{harvnb|Thomas|1994|p=209}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although there was initial speculation that cannabis found in Lee's stomach may have contributed to his death, Teare refuted this, stating that it would "be both 'irresponsible and irrational' to say that [cannabis] might have triggered either the events of Bruce's collapse on May 10 or his death on July 20".&lt;ref name="Thomas 1994 209"/&gt; Dr. R. R. Lycette, the clinical pathologist at Queen Elizabeth Hospital, reported at the coroner hearing that the death could not have been caused by cannabis.&lt;ref name="Thomas 1994 209"/&gt;

At the 1975 [[San Diego Comic-Con]] convention, Lee's friend [[Chuck Norris]] attributed his death to a reaction to the combination of the muscle-relaxant medication he had been taking since 1968 for a ruptured disc in his back and an "[[antibiotic]]" he was given for his headache on the night of his death.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4ekAQfN8x8 Chuck Norris Explains What Really Killed Bruce Lee At The 1975 San Diego Comic-Con Convention] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141106080521/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4ekAQfN8x8 |date=November 6, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2017 episode of the [[Reelz]] TV series ''[[Autopsy: The Last Hours of...]]'', forensic pathologist Dr. Michael Hunter theorized that Lee died of [[adrenal crisis]] brought on by the overuse of [[cortisone]], which Lee had been taking since injuring his back in a 1970 weightlifting mishap.&lt;ref name="hunter"&gt;"Autopsy: The Last Hours of Bruce Lee."  ''Autopsy: The Last Hours of...''.  Nar. Eric Meyers.  Exec. Prod. Ed Taylor and Michael Kelpie.  Reelz, 15 Jul. 2017.  Television.&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. Hunter believes that Lee's exceptionally strong "drive and ambition" played a fundamental role in the martial artist's ultimate demise.&lt;ref name="hunter"/&gt;

In a 2018 biography, author Matthew Polly consulted with medical experts and theorized that Lee died from [[cerebral edema]] caused by over-exertion and [[heat stroke]]; and heat stroke was not considered at the time because it was then a poorly-understood condition.{{sfn|Polly|2018|p=473-475}} Furthermore, Lee had had his underarm sweat glands removed in late 1972, in the apparent belief that underarm sweat was unphotogenic on film.&lt;ref name="hunter"/&gt; Polly further theorized that this caused Lee's body to overheat while practicing in hot temperatures on May 10 and July 20, 1973, resulting in heat stroke that in turn exacerbated the cerebral edema that led to his death.{{sfn|Polly|2018|p=473-475}}

===Certified instructors===
{{more citations needed|section|date=July 2018}}&lt;!--first two paragraphs have no citations--&gt;
Bruce Lee personally certified only three instructors: [[Taky Kimura]], [[James Yimm Lee]], and [[Dan Inosanto]]. Taky Kimura holds a 5th rank in Jun Fan Gung Fu. James Yimm Lee held a 3rd rank in Jun Fan Gung Fu. Inosanto holds the 3rd rank (Instructor) directly from Bruce Lee in Jeet Kune Do, Jun Fan Gung Fu, and Bruce Lee's Tao of Chinese Gung Fu. Ted Wong holds 2nd rank in Jeet Kune Do certified directly by Bruce Lee and was later promoted to Instructor under Dan Inosanto, who felt that Bruce would have wanted to promote him. Other Jeet Kune Do instructors since Lee's death have been certified directly by Dan Inosanto, some with remaining Bruce Lee-signed certificates.

James Yimm Lee, a close friend of Lee, certified a few students including Gary Dill, who studied Jeet Kune Do under James and received permission via a personal letter from him in 1972 to pass on his learning of Jun Fan Gung Fu to others. [[Taky Kimura]], to date, has certified only one person in Jun Fan Gung Fu: his son Andy Kimura. Dan Inosanto continued to teach and certify select students in [[Jeet Kune Do]] for over 30 years, making it possible for thousands of martial arts practitioners to trace their training lineage back to Bruce Lee. Prior to his death, Lee told his then only two living instructors Kimura and Inosanto (James Yimm Lee had died in 1972) to dismantle his schools. Both [[Taky Kimura]] and Dan Inosanto were allowed to teach small classes thereafter, under the guideline "keep the numbers low, but the quality high".

Bruce also instructed several [[World Karate Champion]]s including [[Chuck Norris]], [[Joe Lewis (martial artist)|Joe Lewis]], and [[Mike Stone (karate)|Mike Stone]].  Between the three of them, during their training with Bruce, they won every karate championship in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Little|2001|p=211}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Japan, Junichi Okada is a certified Japanese instructor in Jeet Kune Do.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tokyohive.com/2010/09/v6-okada-junichi-now-a-martial-arts-instructor/|title=V6 Okada Junichi now a martial arts instructor|accessdate=January 15, 2012|date=September 10, 2010|publisher=Tokyo Hive|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120229085958/http://www.tokyohive.com/2010/09/v6-okada-junichi-now-a-martial-arts-instructor/|archivedate=February 29, 2012|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hong Kong legacy===
[[File:Hong kong bruce lee statue.jpg|thumb|[[Bruce Lee statue in Hong Kong]]]]
There are a number of stories (perhaps [[apocrypha]]l) surrounding Lee that are still repeated in [[Culture of Hong Kong|Hong Kong culture]]. One is that his early 1970s interview on the [[TVB]] show ''[[Enjoy Yourself Tonight]]'' cleared the busy streets of Hong Kong as everyone was watching the interview at home.

On January 6, 2009, it was announced that Bruce's Hong Kong home (41 Cumberland Road, Kowloon, Hong Kong) will be preserved and transformed into a tourist site by philanthropist Yu Pang-lin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/film/news/e3i7b57851228481ca584da06e5f92020f5 |title=Bruce Lee's home to become a museum |date=January 6, 2009 |publisher=The Hollywood Reporter |accessdate=August 28, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100807091304/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/film/news/e3i7b57851228481ca584da06e5f92020f5 |archivedate=August 7, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hindu.com/2008/07/19/stories/2008071956432000.htm |title=Bruce Lee 35th anniversary |work=The Hindu |location=India |date=July 19, 2008 |accessdate=June 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Martial arts lineage==
Lee was trained in Wu Tai Chi Chuan (also known as Ng-ga) and Jing Mo Tam Tui for the twelve sets. Lee was trained in the martial arts [[Choy Li Fut]], [[Boxing|Western Boxing]], [[Fencing|Épée fencing]], Judo, Praying Mantis kung fu, Hsing-I, and Jujitsu.

{{quote|When Bruce arrived in the US he (already) had training in Wu Style Tai Chi, sometimes in Hong Kong called Ng-ga. And he had of course training in western boxing. He had training in fencing from his brother, that's Epee, that goes from toe to head. He had training obviously in Wing Chun. And the other area was the training he had received in Buk Pie, or Tam Toi, he was twelve sets in Tam Toi. And I believe he had traded with a Choy Li Fut man.|Danny Inosanto&lt;ref&gt;Bruce Lee's Jeet Kune Do, 1995 Legacy Productions, New Zealand.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Advertising==
Though Bruce Lee did not appear in commercials during his lifetime, [[Nokia]] launched an internet-based campaign in 2008 with staged "documentary-looking" footage of Bruce Lee playing ping-pong with his [[nunchaku]] and also igniting matches as they are thrown towards him. The videos went viral on YouTube, creating confusion as some people believed them to be authentic footage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://agency.asia/issue-02/126-inter%C2%ADviews/237-jwt-beijing.html|title=Agency.Asia - JWT Beijing and Shanghai|first=|last=Agency.Asia|website=agency.asia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These methods can also be used in chemical and allied industries in various other forms.

== History ==

The term chemoinformatics was defined by F.K. Brown&lt;ref name="Brown_1998"&gt;{{Cite book | author = F.K. Brown | title = Chapter 35. Chemoinformatics: What is it and How does it Impact Drug Discovery | journal = Annual Reports in Med.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Chemoinformatics is the mixing of those information resources to transform data into information and information into knowledge for the intended purpose of making better decisions faster in the area of drug lead identification and optimization.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Since then, both spellings have been used, and some have evolved to be established as Cheminformatics,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.molinspiration.com/chemoinformatics.html Cheminformatics or Chemoinformatics ?&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; while European Academia settled in 2006 for Chemoinformatics.&lt;ref name="Obernai"&gt;[http://infochim.u-strasbg.fr/chemoinformatics/Obernai%20Declaration.pdf Obernai Declaration]&lt;/ref&gt; The recent establishment of the [[Journal of Cheminformatics]] is a strong push towards the shorter variant.

== Basics ==
Cheminformatics combines the scientific working fields of [[chemistry]], [[computer science]] and [[information science]] for example in the areas of [[topology (chemistry)|topology]], [[chemical graph theory]], [[information retrieval]] and [[data mining]] in the [[chemical space]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Roy|first=Ambrish|last2=Srinivasan|first2=Bharath|last3=Skolnick|first3=Jeffrey|date=2015-08-12|title=PoLi: A Virtual Screening Pipeline Based on Template Pocket and Ligand Similarity|journal=Journal of Chemical Information and Modeling|language=EN|volume=55|issue=8|pages=1757–1770|doi=10.1021/acs.jcim.5b00232|issn=1549-9596|pmc=4593500|pmid=26225536}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Srinivasan|first=Bharath|last2=Tonddast-Navaei‡|first2=Sam|last3=Roy§|first3=Ambrish|last4=Zhou|first4=Hongyi|last5=Skolnick|first5=Jeffrey|date=2018-09-07|title=Chemical space of Escherichia coli dihydrofolate reductase inhibitors: New approaches for discovering novel drugs for old bugs|journal=Medicinal Research Reviews|language=en|doi=10.1002/med.21538|pmid=30192413|issn=0198-6325}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Srinivasan|first=Bharath|last2=Tonddast-Navaei|first2=Sam|last3=Skolnick|first3=Jeffrey|date=September 2017|title=Pocket detection and interaction-weighted ligand-similarity search yields novel high-affinity binders for Myocilin-OLF, a protein implicated in glaucoma|url=https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0960894X1730731X|journal=Bioorganic &amp; Medicinal Chemistry Letters|volume=27|issue=17|pages=4133–4139|doi=10.1016/j.bmcl.2017.07.035|issn=0960-894X|pmc=5568477|pmid=28739043}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Srinivasan|first=Bharath|last2=Zhou|first2=Hongyi|last3=Mitra|first3=Sreyoshi|last4=Skolnick|first4=Jeffrey|date=October 2016|title=Novel small molecule binders of human N-glycanase 1, a key player in the endoplasmic reticulum associated degradation pathway|url=https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0968089616306265|journal=Bioorganic &amp; Medicinal Chemistry|volume=24|issue=19|pages=4750–4758|doi=10.1016/j.bmc.2016.08.019|issn=0968-0896|pmc=5015769|pmid=27567076}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gasteiger_2004"&gt;Gasteiger J.(Editor), Engel T.(Editor): ''Chemoinformatics : A Textbook''.

== Applications ==

===Storage and retrieval===
{{main|Chemical database}}
The primary application of cheminformatics is in the storage, indexing and search of information relating to compounds. The efficient search of such stored information includes topics that are dealt with in computer science as [[data mining]], [[information retrieval]], [[information extraction]] and [[machine learning]]. Related research topics include:
* [[Unstructured data]]
**[[Information retrieval]]
**[[Information extraction]]
* [[Structured data mining]] and mining of [[structured data]]
**[[Database mining]]
**[[Graph mining]]
**[[Molecule mining]]
**[[Sequence mining]]
**[[Tree mining]]
*[[Digital libraries]]

==== File formats ====
{{main|Chemical file format}}
The ''in silico'' representation of chemical structures uses specialized formats such as the [[XML]]-based [[Chemical Markup Language]] or [[Simplified molecular input line entry specification|SMILES]].  These representations are often used for storage in large [[chemical database]]s. While some formats are suited for visual representations in 2 or 3 dimensions, others are more suited for studying physical interactions, modeling and docking studies.

=== Virtual libraries ===
Chemical data can pertain to real or virtual molecules.  Virtual libraries of compounds
may be generated in various ways to explore chemical space and hypothesize novel 
compounds with desired properties.

Virtual libraries of classes of compounds (drugs, natural products, diversity-oriented synthetic products) were recently generated using the FOG (fragment optimized growth) algorithm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=FOG: Fragment Optimized Growth Algorithm for the de Novo Generation of Molecules occupying Druglike Chemical | last=Kutchukian | first=Peter  |author2=Lou, David |author3=Shakhnovich, Eugene  |journal=Journal of Chemical Information and Modeling | year=2009 |volume=49 | pages=1630–1642|doi=10.1021/ci9000458|pmid=19527020|issue=7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This was done by using cheminformatic tools to train transition probabilities of a [[Markov chain]] on authentic classes of compounds, and then using the Markov chain to generate novel compounds that were similar to the training database.

=== Virtual screening ===
{{main|Virtual screening}}
In contrast to [[high-throughput screening]], virtual screening involves computationally
screening ''[[in silico]]'' libraries of compounds, by means of various methods such as
[[docking (molecular)|docking]], to identify members likely to possess desired properties
such as biological activity against a given target&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;. In some cases, [[combinatorial chemistry]] is used in the development of the library to increase the efficiency in mining the chemical space. More commonly, a diverse library of small molecules or [[natural product]]s is screened.

===Quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR)===
{{main|Quantitative structure–activity relationship}}
This is the calculation of [[quantitative structure–activity relationship]] and [[QSPR|quantitative structure property relationship]] values, used to predict the activity of compounds from their structures. In this context there is also a strong relationship to [[chemometrics]]. Chemical [[expert system]]s are also relevant, since they represent parts of chemical knowledge as an ''[[in silico]]'' representation. There is a relatively new concept of [[matched molecular pair analysis]] or prediction-driven MMPA which is coupled with QSAR model in order to identify activity cliff.&lt;ref name="Prediction-driven matched molecular pairs to interpret QSARs and aid the molecular optimization process"&gt;{{Cite journal | url=http://www.jcheminf.com/content/6/1/48/abstract | doi=10.1186/s13321-014-0048-0| pmid=25544551| pmc=4272757| title=Prediction-driven matched molecular pairs to interpret QSARs and aid the molecular optimization process| journal=Journal of Cheminformatics| volume=6| issue=1| pages=48| year=2014| last1=Sushko| first1=Yurii| last2=Novotarskyi| first2=Sergii| last3=Körner| first3=Robert| last4=Vogt| first4=Joachim| last5=Abdelaziz| first5=Ahmed| last6=Tetko| first6=Igor V.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cody Gribble''' (born September 20, 1990) is an American [[professional golfer]] who is currently playing on the [[PGA Tour]].

==Early years==
Gribble was born in [[Dallas, Texas]]. He played college golf at the [[University of Texas]] and won the [[2012 NCAA Division I Men's Golf Championship|2012 NCAA Championship]] with teammates [[Dylan Frittelli]] and [[Jordan Spieth]]. Gribble is a left-handed golfer.

==Professional career==
In 2014, Gribble finished T8 at [[qualifying school]] to earn his Web.com Tour card, he finished 27th on the money list in 2015 failing to earn a [[PGA Tour]] card by $2,035, but retained his Web.com Tour card for another year. At the 2016 [[United Leasing &amp; Finance Championship]], Gribble was leading by one shot with two holes to play, but after a bogey-bogey finish, he ended the tournament T2, one shot behind eventual winner [[Séamus Power (golfer)|Séamus Power]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.golfchannel.com/news/golf-central-blog/watch-gribble-loses-webcom-event-painful-fashion/ |title=Watch: Gribble loses Web.com event in painful fashion |work=Golf Channel |date=May 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2016, Gribble won his first [[PGA Tour]] title at the [[Sanderson Farms Championship]], an alternate event on the PGA Tour. He shot a seven-under final round 65 to win by 4 strokes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/golf/article-3889082/Cody-Gribble-claims-PGA-Tour-victory-Sanderson-Farms-Championship.html |title= Cody Gribble claims first PGA Tour victory after storming finish at Sanderson Farms Championship |newspaper=[[The Daily Mail]] |agency=Reuters |date=October 31, 2016 |first=Andrew |last=Both}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gribble is the 13th left-handed golfer to win a PGA Tour event and the first since [[Greg Chalmers]] won the 2016 [[Barracuda Championship]].

==Legacy==
Gribble gained a bit of notoriety at the 2017 [[Arnold Palmer Invitational]] at [[Bay Hill, Florida|Bay Hill]] when he tapped an [[alligator]] on the tail that was sunning itself on the 6th fairway during the first round of tournament play. The alligator quickly scampered unharmed into a nearby pond.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/golf/2017/03/17/pga-golfer-casually-removes-alligator-bay-hill-course/|title=PGA golfer casually removes alligator from Bay Hill course|last=Davis|first=Callum|newspaper=The Telegraph|date=March 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.golf.com/extra-spin/2017/03/16/watch-cody-gribble-casually-grabs-alligators-tail-bay-hill|title=WATCH: Cody Gribble casually grabs alligator's tail at Bay Hill|last=Cunningham|first=Kevin|publisher=Golf Magazine|date=March 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Coffin birth''', also known as '''postmortem fetal extrusion''',&lt;ref name=lasso&gt;Lasso ''et al.'' 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=schulz&gt;Schulz 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; is the expulsion of a [[viability (fetal)|nonviable]] [[fetus]] through the [[vagina]]l opening of the decomposing body of a deceased pregnant woman as a result of the increasing pressure of intra-abdominal gases. This kind of [[postmortem]] delivery occurs very rarely during the [[decomposition]] of a body. The practice of [[embalming|chemical preservation]], whereby chemical preservatives and [[disinfectant]] solutions are pumped into a body to replace natural body fluids (and the [[bacteria]] that reside therein), have made the occurrence of "coffin birth" so rare that the topic is rarely mentioned in international medical discourse.

Typically during the decomposition of a human body, naturally occurring bacteria in the organs of the abdominal cavity (such as the [[stomach]] and [[intestines]]) generate gases as by-products of [[metabolism]], which causes the body to swell. In some cases, the confined pressure of the gases can squeeze the [[uterus]] (the womb), even forcing it downward, and it may [[wikt:eversion|turn inside-out]] and be forced out of the body through the vaginal opening (a process called ''[[prolapse]]''). If a fetus is contained within the uterus, it could therefore be expelled from the mother's body through the vaginal opening when the uterus turns inside-out, in a process that, to outward appearances, mimics [[childbirth]]. The main differences lie in the state of the mother and fetus and the mechanism of delivery: in the event of natural, live childbirth, the mother's [[Uterine contraction|contractions]] thin and shorten the cervix to expel the infant from the womb; in a case of coffin birth, built-up gas pressure within the [[putrefaction|putrefied]] body of a pregnant woman pushes the dead fetus from the body of the mother.

Cases have been recorded by medical authorities since the 16th century, though some [[archaeological]] cases provide evidence for its occurrence in many periods of human history. While cases of postmortem fetal expulsion have always been rare, the phenomenon has been recorded under disparate circumstances and is occasionally seen in a modern forensic context when the body of a pregnant woman lies undisturbed and undiscovered for some time following death. There are also cases whereby a fetus may become separated from the body of the pregnant woman about the time of death or during decomposition, though because those cases are not consistent with the processes described here, they are not considered true cases of postmortem fetal extrusion.

==Causes==
{{Signs of death}}
The cause{{ref|a|Note a}} of postmortem fetal extrusion is not completely understood, as the event is neither predictable nor replicable under experimental conditions. Evidence has accumulated opportunistically and direct observation is [[Serendipity|serendipitous]].&lt;ref name=schulz/&gt; While it is possible that more than one cause can produce the same result, there is an accepted hypothesis,&lt;ref name=schulz/&gt;&lt;ref name=gould/&gt; based on established research in the fields of [[biochemistry]] and forensic [[taphonomy]],{{ref|b|Note b}}&lt;ref name=ubelaker&gt;Ubelaker 1997: 80.&lt;/ref&gt; and further supported by observational research, that accounts for the taphonomic mechanisms that would result in the most often encountered cases of postmortem extrusion of a non-viable fetus.

Typically, as a dead body [[decomposition|decomposes]], body tissues become depleted of oxygen and the body begins to [[putrefaction|putrefy]]; [[anaerobic bacteria]] in the gastrointestinal tract proliferate and as a result of increased [[metabolism|metabolic]] activity, release gases such as [[carbon dioxide]], [[methane]], and [[hydrogen sulfide]].&lt;ref name=carter&gt;Carter ''et al.'' 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=gill&gt;Gill-King 1997: 93–108.&lt;/ref&gt; These bacteria [[Bacteria#Secretion|secrete]] exoenzymes{{ref|c|Note c}} to [[digestion|break down]] body cells and [[protein]]s for ingestion which thus weakens organ [[tissue (biology)|tissue]]s. Increasing pressure forces the [[diffusion]] of excessive gases into the weakened tissues where they enter the [[circulatory system]] and spread to other parts of the body, causing both torso and limbs to become [[Decomposition#Bloat|bloated]]. These decompositional processes weaken the structural integrity of organs by separating [[necrosis|necrotizing]] tissue layers.&lt;ref name=gill/&gt; Bloating usually begins from two to five days after death, depending on external temperature, humidity, and other environmental conditions.&lt;ref&gt;Galloway 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; As the volume of gas increases, the pressure begins to force various body fluids to exude from all natural orifices.&lt;ref&gt;Carter and Tibbett 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; It is at this point during the decomposition of a pregnant body that [[Amniotic sac|amniotic membranes]] become stretched and separated, and intra-abdominal gas pressure may force the [[wikt:eversion|eversion]] and [[prolapse]] of the [[uterus]],{{ref|d|Note d}} which would result in the expulsion of the fetus through the vaginal canal.&lt;ref name=knight&gt;Saukko and Knight 2004: 65.&lt;/ref&gt; It has been observed that the bodies of [[parity (medicine)|multiparous]] women{{ref|e|Note e}} are more likely to spontaneously expel the fetus during decomposition than those who died during their first [[pregnancy]], because of the more elastic nature of the [[cervix]].&lt;ref name=williams1904/&gt;

==History==
Numerous documented cases of postmortem fetal extrusion were described in the medical compendium ''Anomalies and Curiosities of Medicine'', first published in 1896.&lt;ref name=gould&gt;Gould and Pyle 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest presented case occurred in 1551 when a pregnant woman was tried and [[hanging|hanged]] by the courts of the [[Spanish Inquisition]]. Four hours after her death, and while the body still hung by the neck, two dead infants were seen to fall free of the body. This is unusual for the short amount of time elapsed between death and the postmortem delivery. As no information is given regarding other ambient circumstances, it is unclear whether the onset of putrefaction was accelerated, or if other causal factors were at work.&lt;ref name=ubelaker/&gt; In the city of [[Brussels]], in 1633, a woman died in convulsions and three days later a fetus was spontaneously expelled. In [[Weissenfels]], in 1861, postmortem fetal extrusion was observed sixty hours after the death of a pregnant woman. Other cases are described, though only a few describe the unexpected discovery of fetal remains following exhumation. Most cases occurred before burial; in some of these, the body was in the casket while in other cases the body was still on its deathbed or on a [[bier]].&lt;ref name=gould/&gt;

During the late 19th century, modern [[embalming]] techniques were developed, whereby preservative and disinfectant chemical compounds (such as [[formaldehyde]]) are pumped into a body, flushing out the body's natural fluids, and with them the bacteria that flourish during putrefaction and generate the gases that comprise the active force behind the expulsion of the fetus.&lt;ref name=dinn&gt;Dinn 1999: 15-17.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the phenomenon was still recognized by medical science and in 1904, John Whitridge Williams wrote a textbook on obstetric medicine that included a section on "coffin birth".&lt;ref name=williams1904&gt;Williams 1904:755–756.&lt;/ref&gt; Although the text has remained an important reference in obstetrics, the subject, whether called "coffin birth" or "postmortem fetal extrusion", was excluded by its 13th edition in 1966,&lt;ref&gt;Eastman and Hellman 1966.&lt;/ref&gt; and was not mentioned in the edition published in 2009.&lt;ref name=williams2009&gt;Cunningham ''et al.'' 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The subject was discussed in German medical literature during the 20th century,&lt;ref&gt;Jungmichel and Musick 1941.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Panning 1941.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Prokop and Göhler 1976: 118.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Strauch 1921.&lt;/ref&gt; though more detailed case reports in the forensic literature have been published recently.&lt;ref name=lasso/&gt;&lt;ref name=schulz/&gt;

In 2005, the body of a 34-year-old woman, eight months pregnant, was discovered in her apartment in [[Hamburg, Germany]].&lt;ref name=schulz/&gt; The body was bloated and discolored, and upon initial examination, it was found that the head of the fetus had made its appearance in the vaginal opening. At [[autopsy]], medical examiners found that both the head and shoulders of the fetus had emerged, and concluded that it was a case of postmortem fetal extrusion in progress. The woman, who had given birth twice before, had died of a heroin overdose.&lt;ref name=schulz/&gt; The case was unusual and serendipitous, as it was the first modern case in which medical practitioners were able to document a case of postmortem fetal extrusion in progress.&lt;ref name=schulz/&gt;
 
In 2008, the body of a 38-year-old woman, seven months pregnant, was discovered in an open field four days after she had disappeared from her residence in [[Panama]].&lt;ref name=lasso/&gt; A plastic bag had been left over her head, and she had been gagged; the case was ruled a homicide. The body had suffered from the tropical heat and high humidity, and was bloated and highly discolored. At autopsy, the remains of the fetus were discovered in the woman's undergarments. Although the fetus was in a similar state of decomposition, the [[umbilical cord]] was intact and still attached to the [[placenta]] inside the uterus.  This was the first forensic case in which it could be concluded that coffin birth had occurred based on the position of the bodies and the clear attachment of the umbilical cord to the un-expelled placenta.&lt;ref name=lasso/&gt;

===Bioarchaeology===
Postmortem fetal extrusion can be very difficult to recognize once a body has undergone complete [[skeletonization (forensics)|skeletonization]], and [[bioarchaeology|bioarchaeologists]] are often very cautious about asserting the presence of this phenomenon.&lt;ref name=lewis&gt;Lewis 2007: 34–37, 91.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=wells&gt;Wells 1975: 1237.&lt;/ref&gt; There are numerous cultural reasons why a mother and an infant might be interred together, so the joint presence of neonatal remains and an adult female is not taken as conclusive evidence of postmortem fetal extrusion;&lt;ref name=lewis/&gt;&lt;ref name=wells/&gt; however, there have been excavated burials where the position of a set of fetal remains relative to those of an adult female supported this [[hypothesis]]. There are a few general guidelines when an archaeologist is assessing the placement of the fetus and the adult:&lt;ref name=lewis/&gt;
# If the fetal remains are found in a [[fetal position]] and are wholly within the pelvic cavity of the adult, the fetus died and was interred before delivery. The pregnant woman may therefore have died due to [[Dystocia|labor complications]].
# If the infant is found alongside the adult, with the head oriented in the same direction as the adult, then the infant was delivered, whether naturally or by caesarian incision, around the time of death, and thereafter interred.
## Delivered infants have also been interred between or alongside the [[tibia]]e (shins), but the infant is still oriented in the same direction as the adult.
## If the majority of the fetal remains are in the pelvic cavity of the adult, yet the legs are extended and/or the cranium lies among the [[rib]]s, then the infant may have been delivered and then placed on top of the mother's torso before burial. As both bodies skeletonized, the infant's bones would have settled among the mother's ribs and [[vertebrae]].
# If the fetal remains are complete and in a position inferior to and in-line with the [[pelvic outlet]], with the head oriented opposite to that of the mother (toward the foot of the coffin or grave), then there is the possibility of coffin birth.&lt;ref name=lewis/&gt;&lt;ref name=fingal&gt;O’Donovan ''et al.'' 2009: 70–71.&lt;/ref&gt; 
## Evidence for postmortem fetal extrusion may be less ambiguous when the fetal remains are found to lie within the pelvic outlet of the adult, thus indicating that partial extrusion had occurred during decomposition.&lt;ref name=hw1975&gt;Hawkes and Wells 1975.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=moller&gt;Møller-Christensen 1982.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1975, it was reported that during the excavation of a medieval cemetery in [[Kings Worthy]], [[England]], fetal remains appeared to lie within the [[Vagina#Childbirth|birth canal]] of the skeleton of a young woman, with the fetal cranium external to the pelvic outlet and between the two [[femur|femora]] (thigh bones) and the fetal leg bones clearly within the [[pelvic cavity]].&lt;ref name=hw1975/&gt; Other cases of coffin birth at archaeological sites have been described, such as in 1978 at a [[Neolithic]] site in Germany,&lt;ref name=kaiser&gt;Kaiser 1978.&lt;/ref&gt; at a medieval site in [[Denmark]] in 1982,&lt;ref name=moller/&gt; and in 2009 at an [[History of Ireland (400–800)|Early Christian period]] site at [[Fingal]], [[Ireland]].&lt;ref name=fingal/&gt; A coffin birth was also described in a 2011 episode of the BBC show ''[[History Cold Case]]'', featuring the Roman era remains of a woman and three neonates discovered near [[Baldock]], [[Hertfordshire]].&lt;ref name=hcc&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b012s3fw "The Woman and Three Babies".] BBC Two.&lt;/ref&gt; Another was identified in 2006 in a 14th-century Black Death cemetery in [[Genoa]], Italy.&lt;ref name=cbb&gt;Cesana ''et al.'' 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applicability of diagnosis==
Because postmortem fetal extrusion is so rare, and occurs under highly idiosyncratic conditions regarding the individual and the ambient environment,&lt;ref name=gould/&gt;&lt;ref name=carter/&gt;&lt;ref name=williams1904/&gt;&lt;ref name=lewis/&gt; this phenomenon has not been studied for possible applications to forensic investigation. Even if the study of postmortem fetal extrusion could lead to improved investigative methods, experimental research would be highly problematic. At present, [[forensic science|forensic scientists]] have at their disposal an array of established techniques and procedures for a death investigation at the stages of decomposition when postmortem fetal extrusion typically occurs.&lt;ref name=knight/&gt;

In archaeology, the study of mortuary context, that is, the interpretation of the postmortem treatment of the dead, whether an individual or as pertains to patterns within a group, has led to the development of hypotheses on social status and/or hierarchy regarding many cultures, ancient and extant.&lt;ref name=moller/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Larsen 1999: 126, 127, 131.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bell 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Solecki 1975.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robb ''et al.'' 1992.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the determination of whether or not delivery actually occurred before death has a bearing on analyses of the mother's population, as the concentration of [[trace element]]s differ markedly between the skeletons of prepartum adult women (before giving birth) and women who are [[lactation|lactating]]; the identification of coffin birth would lead to more accurate analyses of the number of lactating women in a population or the rate of maternal mortality.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis 2007: 37.&lt;/ref&gt; It is therefore necessary for investigators to be able to recognize postmortem fetal extrusion when encountered in an excavated burial.&lt;ref name=wells/&gt;&lt;ref name=ortner&gt;Ortner 2003: 176.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Comparable phenomena==
There are also many cases where the remains of the fetus are found separate from the body of the mother, but expulsion was not through the birth canal, and separation of the two bodies may have been influenced by external environmental factors. The process of separation is so unusual that a specific term for the phenomenon may not have been proposed to the scientific community. These cases may have comparable results, but they are not cases of postmortem fetal extrusion.

In April 2003, the body of [[Laci Peterson]] washed up on a shore near [[San Francisco Bay]]; she had been pregnant when she disappeared four months earlier, and the fetus she had been carrying was discovered on a separate beach. When questioned by the media, medical authorities initially speculated that a "coffin birth" might have occurred.&lt;ref&gt;''USA Today'' 15 April 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; However, at autopsy the cervix was found to be in a [[External orifice of the uterus|prepartum condition]]. Medical examiners later concluded that while Peterson's body was in the bay, the skin over the abdominal cavity had ruptured due to natural decompositional processes. Seawater entered the abdominal cavity and washed out most of the internal organs, along with the fetus.&lt;ref&gt;Fleeman 2003: 141, 142.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, a 23-year-old woman in India, over eight months pregnant, hanged herself after [[Uterine contraction|contractions]] had begun.&lt;ref name=behera&gt;Behera ''et al.'' 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; A viable infant was spontaneously delivered unassisted from the woman's body, which was suspended by the neck. The healthy infant was found on the floor, still tethered to the body of the mother by the umbilical cord. The primary cause of the delivery was the otherwise normal contractions, which had begun before death, and was therefore not related to processes of decomposition.&lt;ref name=gill/&gt;&lt;ref name=behera/&gt; While this is not postmortem fetal extrusion, it may be referred to as a case of ''postmortem delivery'', a term which is applied to a broad range of techniques and phenomena with a resultant delivery of a live infant.&lt;ref&gt;Lopez-Zeno ''et al.'' 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, in Germany, a 23-year-old woman in her third [[Pregnancy#Physiology|trimester]] was involved in a motor vehicle accident, and died; the non-viable fetus was found between her feet.&lt;ref name=vennemann&gt;Vennemann ''et al.'' 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The vehicle caught fire following initial impact . The woman was unable to escape due to internal injuries and burned to death. Investigators came to the conclusion that the extreme heat of the fire burned away [[epidermis (skin)|epidermal]] and [[subcutaneous tissue]] around the abdominal cavity, after which the [[Anatomical terms of location#Anterior and posterior|anterior aspect]] of the uterus ruptured, causing the fetus to spill out of the uterine cavity and land on the floor between the woman's feet. The umbilical cord was still intact and connected the fetus to the placenta through the ruptured wall of the uterus. Unlike the woman, who suffered [[Burn#By depth|fourth-degree]] burns over her entire body, the body of the fetus was relatively undamaged.&lt;ref name=vennemann/&gt; Because the primary cause of separation from the mother's body was thermally induced traumatic rupture of the abdominal and uterine cavities; traumatic separation was not related to normal decompositional processes; and expulsion of the fetus did not involve passage through the birth canal, this is not considered a case of postmortem fetal extrusion.&lt;ref name=vennemann/&gt;

==In animals==
Whales can be subject to postmortem fetal extrusion. Many species float when dead, due to the gases of putrefaction. [[Drift whale]]s that wash up on shore, and the carcasses of [[whaling|hunted whales]], if not [[flensing|flensed]] (stripped of [[blubber]]) and processed in a timely manner, posed a risk. [[Tim Flannery]] wrote that "A rotting whale could fill with gas to bursting, ejecting a fetus the size of a motor vehicle with sufficient force to kill a man."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2012/feb/09/minds-whales/?pagination=false  "On the Minds of the Whales"] by Tim Flannery, NYRB, 9 February 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Columba McVeigh''' (1958 – 1 November 1975) was a youth from [[Northern Ireland]] who was abducted and murdered by the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army]] (IRA). He was listed as one of the "Disappeared" by the [[Independent Commission for the Location of Victims' Remains]].

'''Criticism of religion''' is [[criticism]] of the ideas, the truth, or the practice of [[religion]], including its political and social implications.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last=Beckford|first=James A.|title=Social Theory and Religion| page=2| year=2003| publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge, UK|isbn=0-521-77431-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historical records of criticism of religion goes back to at least 5th century BCE in [[ancient Greece]], with [[Diagoras of Melos|Diagoras "the Atheist" of Melos]]. In [[ancient Rome]], an early known example is [[Lucretius]]' ''[[De Rerum Natura]]'' from the 1st century BCE.

Every exclusive religion on Earth that promotes [[Truth claim|exclusive truth]] claims necessarily denigrates the truth claims of other religions.&lt;ref&gt;See [[Saumur v Quebec (City of)]]''. &lt;br/&gt;See also: &lt;br/&gt;{{cite book|author1=Katharine Gelber|author2=Adrienne Sarah Ackary Stone|title=Hate Speech and Freedom of Speech in Australia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Y3oYYweMrF8C|year=2007|publisher=Federation Press|isbn=978-1-86287-653-8|quote=In some belief systems, religious leaders and believers maintain the right to both emphasise the benefits of their own religion and criticise other religions; that is, they make their own claims and deny the truth claims of others.|page=179}}&lt;br/&gt;{{cite book|quote=people of every religion, as well as of no religion, have a reason for wanting it to be possible to face other people with challenges to their faith, namely that this is the only way those people can be brought to see the truth.|author1=Michael Herz|author2=Peter Molnar|title=The Content and Context of Hate Speech: Rethinking Regulation and Responses|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KC0gAwAAQBAJ|date=9 April 2012|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-107-37561-1}}&lt;br/&gt;{{cite web|quote=Due to the nature of religious belief, one person's faith often implies that another's is wrong and perhaps even offensive, constituting blasphemy.

==History of criticism of religion==
In his work ''[[De Rerum Natura]]'', the 1st century [[BCE]] Roman poet [[Titus Lucretius Carus]] wrote: "But 'tis that same religion oftener far / Hath bred the foul impieties of men".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://books.mirror.org/gb.lucretius.html |author=Titus Lucretius Carus |authorlink=Titus Lucretius Carus |title=De Rerum Natura |accessdate=2007-08-05 |work= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070630071929/http://books.mirror.org/gb.lucretius.html |archivedate=2007-06-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A philosopher of the [[Epicurean]] school, [[Lucretius]], believed the world was composed solely of matter and void and that all phenomena could be understood as resulting from purely natural causes. Despite believing in Gods, Lucretius, like [[Epicurus]], felt that religion was born of fear and ignorance, and that understanding the natural world would free people of its shackles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.utm.edu/research/iep/l/lucretiu.htm |title=Lucretius (c.99&amp;nbsp;– c.55 BCE) |publisher=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy |accessdate=2007-08-05 |work=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Stanford - Lucretius"&gt;{{cite web|title=Lucretius – Stanford Encyclopedia|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/|accessdate=19 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was not against religion in and of itself, but against traditional religion which he saw as [[superstition]] for teaching that gods interfered with the world.&lt;ref name="Latin-English: On Nature"&gt;{{cite book|title=On the Nature of Things Translated by W.H.D.

At the beginning of the 16th century, [[Niccolò Machiavelli]] said: "We Italians are irreligious and corrupt above others... because the church and her representatives have set us the worst example".&lt;ref name="{{ISBN|014044534x}}"&gt;{{Cite book|author1=Middlemore, S.

In the 18th century, [[Voltaire]] was a [[deism|deist]] and was strongly critical of religious intolerance. [[Voltaire]] complained about Jews killed by other Jews for worshiping a golden calf and similar actions, he also condemned how Christians killed other Christians over religious differences and how Christians killed [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]] for not being [[Baptism|baptised]]. Voltaire claimed the real reason for these killings was that Christians wanted to plunder the wealth of those killed. Voltaire was also critical of [[Muslim]] intolerance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://history.hanover.edu/texts/voltaire/volrelig.html|title=Voltaire's Philosophical Dictionary|publisher=|accessdate=30 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in the 18th century, [[David Hume]] criticised [[teleological argument]]s for religion. Hume claimed that natural explanations for the order in the [[universe]] were reasonable, see [[David Hume#Design argument|design argument]]. An important aim of Hume's writings was demonstrating the unsoundness of the philosophical basis for religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/hume-religion/|title=Hume on Religion|publisher=|accessdate=30 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Christopher Hitchens crop.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Christopher Hitchens]], journalist and author of ''[[God is not Great]]'']]
In the early 21st century, the [[New Atheism|New Atheists]] became focal polemicists in modern criticism of religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bailey|first=David|title=What are the merits of recent claims by atheistic scholars that modern science proves religion to be false and vain?|url=http://www.sciencemeetsreligion.org/theology/atheists.php}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The New Atheists|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/n-atheis/|publisher=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt; The four authors come from widely different backgrounds and have published books which have been the focus of criticism of religion narratives, with over 100 books and hundreds of scholarly articles commenting on and critiquing the four Horsemen's works. Their books and articles have spawned debate in multiple fields of inquiry and are heavily quoted in popular media (online forums, [[YouTube]], television and popular philosophy). In ''[[The End of Faith]]'', philosopher [[Sam Harris (author)|Sam Harris]] focuses on violence among other toxic qualities of religion. In ''[[Breaking the Spell: Religion as a Natural Phenomenon|Breaking the Spell]]'', philosopher [[Daniel Dennett]] focuses on the question of "why we believe strange things". In ''[[The God Delusion]]'', biologist [[Richard Dawkins]] covers almost every facet of religion injecting both snarky irony and humor. In ''[[God Is Not Great]]'', journalist and polemicist [[Christopher Hitchens]] focused on how religious forces attacks human dignity and the corruption of religious organizations. In the ''Oxford Handbook of Atheism'', according to Thomas Zenc the four books were published during a time of intense debate on political, religious and sociological questions. The works share many common themes yet notably differ in scope, style and content. While according to Zenc the beginnings of a broader narrative ([[New Atheism]]) seems to have emerged it does not, stand up to the full definition of a movement.&lt;ref&gt;The Oxford Handbook on Atheism.

===Response to general criticism of religion in an historical context===

{{Main|Religion|Definition of religion}}

Today, religion is broadly conceived as an abstraction which entails beliefs, doctrines and sacred places—even though the ancient and medieval cultures that produced [[religious text]]s, like the [[Bible]] or the [[Quran]], did not have such conceptions or ideas in their languages, cultures, or histories.&lt;ref name="Nongbri"/&gt;&lt;ref name="50 myths"/&gt; However, there is still no scholarly consensus over what a religion is.&lt;ref name="Fitzgerald"&gt;{{Cite book|ref= harv|first= Timothy|last= Fitzgerald|title= Discourse on Civility and Barbarity|publisher= Oxford University Press|year= 2007|pages= 45–46 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=b67p1VdF_OoC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Nongbri" /&gt;&lt;ref name="50 myths" /&gt;&lt;ref name="dubuisson"/&gt;

Before the 17th century religion was conflated with every day life. [[Religion]] as a modern Western concept developed from the 17th century onwards.&lt;ref name="50 myths"&gt;{{cite book|last1= Morreall|first1= John|last2= Sonn|first2= Tamara|title= 50 Great Myths of Religion|chapter= Myth 1: All Societies Have Religions|date= 2013|publisher= Wiley-Blackwell|isbn= 9780470673508|pages= 12–17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Nongbri&gt;{{cite book|last1= Nongbri|first1= Brent|title= Before Religion: A History of a Modern Concept|date= 2013|publisher= Yale University Press|isbn= 030015416X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Harrison Territories"&gt;{{cite book|last1= Harrison|first1= Peter|title= The Territories of Science and Religion|date= 2015|publisher= University of Chicago Press|isbn= 022618448X | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=WLvnBgAAQBAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=dubuisson&gt;{{cite book|first1= Daniel|last1= Dubuisson|title= The Western Construction of Religion : Myths, Knowledge, and Ideology|date= 2007|publisher= Johns Hopkins University Press|location= Baltimore, Md.|isbn= 0801887569 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=kyl5K2TV8zMC}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in Asia, no one before the 19th century self-identified as a "Hindu" or other similar identities.&lt;ref name="50 myths"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Invention Japan"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Josephson|first1=Jason Ananda|title=The Invention of Religion in Japan|pages=11–12|date=2012|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=0226412342}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="50 myths"/&gt;

With the existence of diverse modern categories of religion such as [[monotheism]], [[polytheism]], [[pantheism]], [[Nontheistic religions|nontheism]] and diverse specific religions such as [[Christianity]], [[Judaism]], [[Islam]], [[Taoism]], [[Buddhism]] and many others, it is not always clear to whom the criticisms are aimed at or to what extent they are applicable to other religions.

{{See also|Development of religion}}

Dennett and Harris have asserted that theist religions and their scriptures are not divinely inspired, but man made to fulfill [[society|social]], [[biological]] and [[political]] needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=[[Breaking the Spell: Religion as a Natural Phenomenon|Breaking the Spell]]|publisher=Allen Lane|year=2006|isbn=0-7139-9789-3|first=Daniel|last=Dennett|authorlink=Daniel Dennett}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=[[The End of Faith]]|publisher=W.

===Narratives to provide comfort and meaning===
[[David Hume]] argued that religion developed as a source of comfort in the face of the adversity, not as an honest grappling with verifiable truth. Religion is therefore an unsophisticated form of reasoning.&lt;ref&gt;Bashevkin, Dovid.  [http://www.thelehrhaus.com/timely-thoughts/2016/9/29/jonah-and-the-varieties-of-religious-motivation-a-religious-educators-perspective-on-why-people-become-religious "Jonah and the Varieties of Religious Motivation."] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161012155807/http://www.thelehrhaus.com/timely-thoughts/2016/9/29/jonah-and-the-varieties-of-religious-motivation-a-religious-educators-perspective-on-why-people-become-religious |date=2016-10-12 }} ''Lehrhaus''.  9 October 2016.  2 October 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Daniel Dennett]] has argued that, with the exception of more modern religions such as [[Raëlism]], [[Mormonism]], [[Scientology]] and the [[Bahá'í Faith]], most religions were formulated at a time when the origin of life, the workings of the body, and the nature of the stars and planets were poorly understood.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Dennett, Daniel Clement |title=Breaking the Spell : Religion as a Natural Phenomenon |publisher=Viking Adult |location= |year= 2006|isbn=0-670-03472-X |oclc= |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These narratives were intended to give solace and a sense of relationship with larger forces. As such, they may have served several important functions in ancient societies. Examples include the views many religions traditionally had towards solar and lunar [[eclipse]]s and the appearance of [[comet]]s (forms of [[astrology]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| title =When solar fears eclipse reason | work = | publisher =BBC News | date =2006-03-28 | url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/4852690.stm | doi = | accessdate=2010-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title =Comets in Ancient Cultures | work = | publisher =NASA | url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/deepimpact/media/f_ancient.html | doi = | accessdate =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Given current understanding of the physical world, where human knowledge has increased dramatically, Dawkins and French atheist philosopher [[Michel Onfray]] contend that continuing to hold on to these belief systems is irrational and no longer useful.&lt;ref name="The God Delusion" /&gt;&lt;ref name="{{ISBN|1-55970-820-4}}"&gt;{{Cite book|author=Onfray, Michel |authorlink=Michel Onfray |title=Atheist Manifesto: The Case Against Christianity, Judaism, and Islam |publisher=Arcade Publishing |location= |year= 2007|isbn=1-55970-820-4 |oclc= |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Opium of the people====
[[File:Karl Marx 001.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Karl Marx]]]]
{{quote|Religious suffering is, at the same time, the expression of real suffering and a protest against real suffering. Religion is the sigh of the oppressed creature, the heart of a heartless world, and the soul of soulless conditions. It is the [[opium of the people]].|[[Karl Marx]]&lt;ref name="critright"/&gt;}}
According to [[Karl Marx]], the father of "[[scientific socialism]]", religion is a tool used by the [[ruling class]]es whereby the masses can shortly relieve their suffering via the act of experiencing religious emotions. It is in the interest of the ruling classes to instill in the masses the religious conviction that their current suffering will lead to eventual happiness. Therefore, as long as the public believes in religion, they will not attempt to make any genuine effort to understand and overcome the real source of their suffering, which in Marx's opinion was their [[capitalist]] economic system. In this perspective, Marx saw religion as [[escapism]].&lt;ref name="critright"&gt;{{Cite book| last =Marx | first =Karl | authorlink =Karl Marx |chapter=Introduction | title = A Contribution to the Critique of Hegel's Philosophy of Right | publisher =Deutsch-Französische Jahrbücher |date=February 1844 | location = | url =http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1843/critique-hpr/intro.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Marx also viewed the Christian doctrine of [[original sin]] as being deeply [[anti-social behaviour|anti-social]] in character. Original sin, he argued, convinces people that the source of their misery lies in the inherent and unchangeable "sinfulness" of humanity rather than in the forms of social organization and institutions, which Marx argued can be changed through the application of collective social planning.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last =Marx | first =Karl | authorlink =Karl Marx | title =Das Kapital | publisher = | year =1867 | location =  | url =http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch26.htm | doi = | id = | nopp =true| page =Volume 1, Part VIII  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Viruses of the mind===
[[File:Richard dawkins lecture.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Richard Dawkins]], author of ''[[The God Delusion]]'']]
In his 1976 book ''[[The Selfish Gene]]'', [[Richard Dawkins]] coined the term [[memes]] to describe informational units that can be transmitted culturally, analogous to genes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last =Dawkins | first =Richard | title =[[The Selfish Gene]], 30th Anniversary edition  | publisher =  | year =2006 | location = | url =  | doi =  | id =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; He later used this concept in the essay "[[Viruses of the Mind]]" to explain the persistence of religious ideas in human culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last =Dawkins | first =Richard | title =Viruses of the Mind | work = | publisher = | year =1991 | url =http://cscs.umich.edu/~crshalizi/Dawkins/viruses-of-the-mind.html | doi = | accessdate =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Response to virus of the mind criticism====

Both the religious and non religious are critical of Dawkin's meme theory which has mostly been abandoned. [[John Bowker (theologian)|John Bowker]] criticized the idea that "God" and "Faith" are viruses of the mind, suggesting that Dawkins' "account of religious motivation [...] is [...] far removed from evidence and data" that it is unreasonable to extract certain behaviours solely through religious memes.&lt;ref&gt;In his 1992–93 [[Gresham College]] lectures, written in collaboration with the psychiatrist Quinton Deeley and published as ''Is God a Virus?'', SPCK, 1995, 274 pp. The quotes here come from p.73.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alister McGrath]] has responded by arguing that "memes have no place in serious scientific reflection",&lt;ref&gt;''Dawkins's God: Genes, Memes and the Meaning of Life'', p.125, quoting [[Simon Conway Morris]] in support&lt;/ref&gt; that there is strong evidence that such ideas are not spread by random processes, but by deliberate intentional actions,&lt;ref&gt;''Dawkins's God: Genes, Memes and the Meaning of Life'', p.126&lt;/ref&gt; that "evolution" of ideas is more [[Lamarckism|Lamarckian]] than [[Darwinian]]&lt;ref&gt;''Dawkins's God: Genes, Memes and the Meaning of Life'', p.127&lt;/ref&gt; and that there is no evidence (and certainly none in the essay) that epidemiological models usefully explain the spread of religious ideas.&lt;ref&gt;''Dawkins's God: Genes, Memes and the Meaning of Life'' pp.137–138&lt;/ref&gt; McGrath also points out that it is surveys in the United States report a high life satisfaction rate among the religious is not comparable with a virus.&lt;ref&gt;''Dawkins's God: Genes, Memes and the Meaning of Life'', p.136, citing [[Harold G. Koenig|Koenig]] and Cohen, ''The Link between Religion and Health'', OUP, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mental illness or delusion===
{{see also|Neuroscience of religion|Psychology of religion#Religion and mental illness|Religion and schizophrenia}}

In his research recent brain imaging of religious subjects praying or meditating show identical activity in the respective human section of the brain which [[Ramachandran]] calls God-spots.

[[Psilocybin]] from mushrooms affect regions of the brain includingthe serotonergic system, which generating a sense of strong religious meaning, unity and ecstasy.

In [[Michael Shermer]]'s book ''Why People Believe Strange Things'' he theorizes on how emerging mankind imposed made-up explanations and bizarre rituals for natural phenomena they didn't and couldn't understand.

===Immature stage of societal development===
[[File:Daniel Huntington Philosophy and Christian Art.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Natural philosophy|Philosophy]] and [[Christian Art]], W. Ridgway, 1878]]
Philosopher [[Auguste Comte]] posited that many societal constructs pass through [[Law of three stages|three stages]] and that religion corresponds to the two earlier, or more primitive stages by stating: "From the study of the development of human intelligence, in all directions, and through all times, the discovery arises of a great fundamental law, to which it is necessarily subject, and which has a solid foundation of proof, both in the facts of our organization and in our historical experience.

In his book ''[[Is Religion Dangerous?]]'', [[Keith Ward]] notes that not all false opinions are delusions and that belief in God is different as many great minds and people who live ordinary lives and believe in God are not irrational people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last =Ward | first =Keith | authorlink =Keith Ward | title =Is Religion Dangerous? | publisher = Lion| year =2006 | location =London:Lion Hudson Plc | url = | doi = | isbn = 978-0-7459-5262-8 | page =172 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hyperreligiosity or even "intensely professed atheism" can emerge from emotional disturbances involving temporal lobe epilepsy.&lt;ref name="Heilman"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Heilman|first1=Kenneth M.|last2=Valenstein|first2=Edward |title=Clinical Neuropsychology|date=13 October 2011|publisher=Oxford University Press|language=English|isbn=9780195384871|page=488|quote=Studies that claim to show no difference in emotional makeup between temporal lobe and other epileptic patients (Guerrant et. al., 1962; Stevens, 1966) have been reinterpreted (Blumer, 1975) to indicate that there is, in fact, a difference: those with temporal lobe epilepsy are more likely to have more serious forms of emotional disturbance. This typical personality of temporal lobe epileptic patient has been described in roughly similar terms over many years (Blumer &amp; Benson, 1975; Geschwind, 1975, 1977; Blumer, 1999; Devinsky &amp; Schachter, 2009). These patients are said to have a deepening of emotions; they ascribe great significance to commonplace events. This can be manifested as a tendency to take a cosmic view; hyperreligiosity (or intensely professed atheism) is said to be common.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jerusalem syndrome===
{{Main|Jerusalem syndrome}}
Jerusalem has loaned its name to a unique psychological phenomenon where Jewish or Christian individuals who develop obsessive religious themed ideas or delusions (sometimes believing themselves to be Jesus Christ or another prophet) will feel compelled to travel to Jerusalem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jerusalem Syndrome: Jewish Virtual Library|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/History/jersynd.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jerusalem Syndrome|url=http://savvytraveler.publicradio.org/show/features/2000/20000603/jerusalem.shtml}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Of these, 470 were admitted to hospital. On average, 100 such tourists have been seen annually, 40 of them requiring admission to hospital. About 2 million tourists visit Jerusalem each year.

===Honor killings and stoning===
{{Main|Honor killings|stoning}}
Honor killings once well known in the Western are now extremely rare however they still occur in other parts of the world. An honor is when a person is killed by family for bringing [[honour|dishonor]] or [[shame]] upon the family.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/ethics/honourcrimes/crimesofhonour_1.shtml#h3 |title=Ethics - Honour crimes |publisher=BBC |date=1970-01-01 |accessdate=2013-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stoning is a form of capital punishment whereby a group throws stones at a person until death ensues. As of September 2010, stoning is a punishment that is included in the laws in some countries including Saudi Arabia, Sudan, Yemen, the United Arab Emirates, and some states in Nigeria&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Handley|first=Paul|title=Islamic countries under pressure over stoning|url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5ixvYN7oeF8ehN9beAHZ4G_YlfKeA|accessdate=22 April 2011|newspaper=AFP|date=11 Sep 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; as punishment for [[Zina|zina al-mohsena]] ("adultery of married persons").&lt;ref name=FAQ&gt;{{cite web|title=Frequently Asked Questions about Stoning|url=http://www.violenceisnotourculture.org/faq_stoning|publisher=violence is not our culture|accessdate=14 May 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129025158/http://www.violenceisnotourculture.org/faq_stoning|archive-date=2014-11-29|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; While stoning may not be codified in the laws of Afghanistan and Somalia, both countries have seen several incidents of stoning to death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Sommerville|first=Quentin|title=Afghan police pledge justice for Taliban stoning|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-south-asia-12292917|accessdate=22 April 2011|newspaper=BBC|date=26 Jan 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Nebehay|first=Stephanie|title=Pillay accuses Somali rebels of possible war crimes|url=http://in.reuters.com/article/2009/07/10/idINIndia-40950620090710|accessdate=22 April 2011|newspaper=Times of India|date=10 Jul 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Until the early 2000s, stoning was a legal form of [[capital punishment]] in Iran.  In 2002, the Iranian judiciary officially placed a moratorium on stoning.&lt;ref name=BBC312&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/6288156.stm |title=Iran 'adulterer' stoned to death |date=10 July 2007 |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=3 December 2012 |archivedate=4 December 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6Cf5UEbg5?url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/6288156.stm |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, judiciary spokesman [[Jamal Karimirad]] stated that "in the Islamic republic, we do not see such punishments being carried out", further adding that if stoning sentences were passed by lower courts, they were overruled by higher courts and "no such verdicts have been carried out".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/4166137.stm |title=Iran denies execution by stoning |publisher=BBC News |date=11 January 2005 |accessdate=2010-09-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, the judiciary decided to fully scrap the punishment from the books in legislation submitted to parliament for approval.&lt;ref name="afp.google.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5iZ7aTbPW-vzYtgdxmx1O5Iok-CMQ |title=Iran to scrap death by stoning |publisher=[[Agence France-Presse|AFP]] |date=August 6, 2008 |accessdate=September 23, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101010081413/http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5iZ7aTbPW-vzYtgdxmx1O5Iok-CMQ |archivedate=October 10, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In early 2013, Iranian parliament published official report about excluding stoning from penal code and it accused Western media for spreading "noisy propaganda" about the case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rc.majlis.ir/fa/news/show/831790|title="سنگسار" در شرع حذف شدنی نیست|website=مرکز پژوهش ها}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Genital modification and mutilation===
According to the [[World Health Organization]], female [[genital modification and mutilation|genital mutilation]] has no health benefits and is a violation of basic human rights. Though no first tier religious texts prescribe the practice, some practitioners do believe there is religious support for it. While it is mostly found in Muslim countries it is also practiced by some Christian and Animist countries mostly in Africa. GFA is not widely practiced in some Muslim countries making it difficult to separate religion from culture. Some religious leaders promote it, some consider it irrelevant to religion, and others contribute to its elimination". The practice is illegal in all Western countries and it is also illegal to transport a girl to another country to carry out FGM. Multiple parents have been charged for committing this crime in the United Kingdom with those charged being exclusively from Muslim countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs241/en/|title=Female genital mutilation|website=World Health Organization}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Male circumcision is a cost effective way for disease prevention and helps reduce medical costs overall.&lt;ref name="male circumcision"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Morris |first1=Brian J. |last2=Bailis |first2=Stefan A. |last3=Wiswell |first3=Thomas E. |title=Circumcision Rates in the United States: Rising or Falling?

As such, some have argued that failure to circumcise a baby boy may be unethical because it diminishes his right to good health.&lt;ref name="male circumcision" /&gt;

===Counterarguments to religion as harmful to individuals===
A metareview of 850 research papers on Religion in the [[United States]] concluded that "the majority of well-conducted studies found that higher levels of religious involvement are positively associated with indicators of psychological well-being ([[life satisfaction]], happiness, positive affect and higher morale and with lower rates of depression, suicidal thoughts and behavior and drug/alcohol use/abuse".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal  | doi = 10.1590/S1516-44462006005000006  | last1= Moreira-Almeida | first1 = Alexander | first2 = Francisco Lotufo |last2=Neto | last3= Koenig |first3= Harold G. | authorlink3=Harold G.

A cross-national investigation on subjective [[well-being]] has noted that, globally, religious people are usually happier than nonreligious people, though nonreligious people also reach high levels of happiness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=International Differences in Well-Being|year=2010|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-973273-9|pages=378–385|author=Ronald Inglehart|editor= Diener, John F. |editor2=Helliwell, Daniel Kahneman|chapter=Faith and Freedom: Traditional and Modern Ways to Happiness}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{verify source|date=July 2018}}

Despite [[honor killings]] occurring in multiple cultures and religions [[Islam]] is frequently blamed for their institution and persistence. Professor Tahira Shaid Khan notes that there is nothing in the [[Qur'an]] that permits or sanctions [[honor killings]].&lt;ref name=r1&gt;Hilary Mantell [http://www.unl.edu/rhames/courses/212/readings/honor-kil-ng.pdf Thousands of Women Killed for Family "Honor"]. National Geographic News. February 12, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; attributes it to broader attitudes that view women as property with no rights as the explanation for honor killings.&lt;ref name=r1/&gt; Khan also argues that this view results in [[violence against women]] and their being turned "into a commodity which can be exchanged, bought and sold".&lt;ref name="Sanctuary For Families"&gt;{{cite web|title=International Domestic Violence Issues |url=http://www.sanctuaryforfamilies.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=252&amp;Itemid=259 |publisher=Sanctuary For Families |accessdate=2011-12-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141016194204/http://www.sanctuaryforfamilies.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=252&amp;Itemid=259 |archivedate=2014-10-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Harm to society==
Some aspects of religion are criticized on the basis that they damage society as a whole. [[Steven Weinberg]], for example, states it takes religion to make good people do evil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.physlink.com/Education/essay_weinberg.cfm|title=A Designer Universe?|last=Weinberg|first=Steven|date=April 1999|work=PhysLink.com|accessdate=2010-02-22|location=Washington, D.C.|quote= With or without religion, good people can behave well and bad people can do evil; but for good people to do evil — that takes religion.}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bertrand Russell]] and [[Richard Dawkins]] cite religiously inspired or justified violence, resistance to social change, attacks on [[science]], repression of women and [[homophobia]].&lt;ref name="Russell"&gt;{{cite web| last=Russell| first=Bertrand| url=http://www.positiveatheism.org/hist/russell2.htm| title=''Has Religion Made Useful Contributions to Civilization?''| accessdate=2009-10-23| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090724090115/http://www.positiveatheism.org/hist/russell2.htm| archivedate=2009-07-24| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hartung has claimed that major religious moral codes can lead to "us vs. them" group [[wikt:solidarity|solidarity]] and mentality which can dehumanise or [[Demonization|demonise]] individuals outside their group as "not fully human", or less worthy.

[[John William Draper]] and [[Andrew Dickson White]], authors of the [[conflict thesis]], have argued that when a religion offers a complete set of answers to the problems of purpose, [[morality]], origins, or science, it often discourages exploration of those areas by suppressing curiosity, denies its followers a broader perspective and can prevent social, moral and scientific progress.

==Morality==
{{See also|Human sacrifice|Morality and religion|Religious intolerance}}
[[Richard Dawkins]] contends that [[Theism|theistic religions]] devalue human compassion and morality. In his view, the [[Bible]] contains many injunctions against following one's conscience over scripture and positive actions are supposed to originate not from compassion, but from the fear of punishment.&lt;ref name="The God Delusion" /&gt; [[Albert Einstein]] stated that no religious basis is needed in order to display ethical behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Religion and Science| last=Einstein| first=Albert| newspaper=New York Times Magazine| date=1930-11-09|quote=A man's ethical behavior should be based effectually on sympathy, education, and social ties; no religious basis is necessary. Man would indeed be in a poor way if he had to be restrained by fear of punishment and hope of reward after death.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Survey research suggests that believers do tend to hold different views than non-believers on a variety of social, ethical and moral questions. According to a 2003 survey conducted in the United States by [[The Barna Group]], those who described themselves as believers were less likely than those describing themselves as atheists or agnostics to consider the following behaviors morally acceptable: [[cohabitation|cohabitating]] with someone of the opposite sex outside of marriage, enjoying sexual fantasies, having an [[abortion]], sexual relationships outside of marriage, [[gambling]], consuming [[marijuana]], looking at [[pornography|pictures of nudity or explicit sexual behavior]], getting [[drunkeness|drunk]] and "[[homosexuality|having a sexual relationship with someone of the same sex]]".&lt;ref name="Morality Continues to Decay"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20040203202833/http://www.barna.org/cgi-bin/PagePressRelease.asp?PressReleaseID=152&amp;Reference=F "The Barna Update: Morality Continues to Decay" (archive copy at the [[Internet Archive]])], [[The Barna Group]], November 3, 2003 ([http://www.barna.org/barna-update/article/5-barna-update/129-morality-continues-to-decay "The Barna Update: Morality Continues to Decay" – Summary version posted on the Barna website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131224045707/https://www.barna.org/barna-update/article/5-barna-update/129-morality-continues-to-decay |date=2013-12-24 }})&lt;/ref&gt;

===Children===
{{See also|Indoctrination|Mind control|Religion and children|Child marriage}}
In the 19th century, philosopher [[Arthur Schopenhauer]] argued that teaching some ideas to children at a young age could foster resistance to doubting those ideas later on.&lt;ref&gt;"And as the capacity for believing is strongest in childhood, special care is taken to make sure of this tender age. This has much more to do with the doctrines of belief taking root than threats and reports of miracles. If, in early childhood, certain fundamental views and doctrines are paraded with unusual solemnity, and an air of the greatest earnestness never before visible in anything else; if, at the same time, the possibility of a doubt about them be completely passed over, or touched upon only to indicate that doubt is the first step to eternal perdition, the resulting impression will be so deep that, as a rule, that is, in almost every case, doubt about them will be almost as impossible as doubt about one's own existence."- Arthur Schopenhauer -''On Religion: A Dialogue''&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Homosexuality and religion}}

[[Homosexuality]] is unambiguously condemned in [[Abrahamic religions]] where prohibition and execution of those who engage in male homosexual activity are found in the Old testament of the bible and in the Koran. Homosexuals are also condemned in the New Testament several times but without obligatory punishment. In the United States, conservative [[Christian right]] groups such as the [[Christian Legal Society]] and the [[Alliance Defense Fund]] have filed numerous lawsuits against public universities, aimed at overturning policies that protect homosexuals from discrimination and [[hate speech]]. These groups argue that such policies infringe their [[Freedom of religion|right to freely exercise religion]] as guaranteed by the [[Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment]] of the [[United States Constitution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Simon |first=Stephanie |title=Christians Sue for Right Not to Tolerate Policies |work= |publisher=Los Angeles Times |date=10 April 2006 | url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/access/1018310011.html?dids=1018310011:1018310011&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Apr+10%2C+2006&amp;author=Stephanie+Simon&amp;pub=Los+Angeles+Times&amp;edition=&amp;startpage=A.1&amp;desc=Christians+Sue+for+Right+Not+to+Tolerate+Policies |accessdate=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most secularised Christian countries have legalised homosexual activity and several have legalised [[same-sex marriage]]. However, not all historically Christian countries have done so such as [[Russia]] and [[Uganda]] which have introduces discriminatory laws ranging from anti-propaganda laws to corporal punishment. Homosexuality is still illegal in most [[Muslim world|Muslim countries]] and several of these countries impose the [[Capital punishment|death penalty]] for homosexual behavior. In July 2005, [[Mahmoud Asgari and Ayaz Marhoni|two Iranian men]] aged sixteen and eighteen were, supposedly, hanged for homosexuality, causing an international outcry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| last=Eke |first=Steven |title=Iran 'must stop youth executions' |wor = |language= |publisher=BBC News |date=28 July 2005 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/4725959.stm |accessdate=2010-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In line with other findings suggesting that religious humanitarianism is largely directed at in-group members, greater religious identification, greater extrinsic religiosity and greater religious fundamentalism were associated with racial prejudice.  This is congruent with the fact that 50% of religious congregations in the US are [[Racial segregation|racially segregated]], and only 12% have a degree of diversity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hall|first1=Deborah L.|last2=Matz|first2=David C.|last3=Wood|first3=Wendy|title=Why Don’t We Practice What We Preach?

Religion has been used by some as justification for advocating [[racism]]. The [[Christian Identity]] movement has been associated with racism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last = Berlet |first = Chip |authorlink = Chip Berlet |year = 2004 |url = http://www.publiceye.org/rightist/idennlns.html |title = A New Face for Racism &amp; Fascism  |work = White Supremacist, Antisemitic, and Race Hate Groups in the U.S.: A Genealogy |publisher = Political Research Associates   |accessdate = 2007-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there are arguments that these positions may be as much reflections of contemporary social views as of what has been called [[scientific racism]].&lt;ref&gt;"Ostensibly scientific": cf. Adam Kuper, Jessica Kuper (eds.), ''The social science encyclopedia'' (1996), "Racism", p. 716: "This [''sc. scientific''] racism entailed the use of 'scientific techniques', to sanction the belief in European and American racial superiority"; ''Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy: Questions to sociobiology'' (1998), "Race, theories of", p. 18: "Its exponents [''sc. of scientific racism''] tended to equate race with species and claimed that it constituted a scientific explanation of human history"; Terry Jay Ellingson, ''The myth of the noble savage'' (2001), 147ff. "In scientific racism, the racism was never very scientific; nor, it could at least be argued, was whatever met the qualifications of actual science ever very racist" (p. 151); Paul A. Erickson, Liam D. Murphy, ''A History of Anthropological Theory'' (2008), p. 152: "Scientific racism: Improper or incorrect science that actively or passively supports racism".&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] had [[Black people and Mormonism|excluded African Americans]] from the [[Priesthood (LDS Church)|priesthood]] from 1860 to 1978.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=One Nation Under Gods: A History of the Mormon Church|year=2002|first=Richard|last=Abanes|authorlink=Richard Abanes|isbn=1-56858-219-6|publisher=Four Walls Eight Windows}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most [[Mormon fundamentalism|fundamentalist Mormon]] [[List of sects in the Latter Day Saint movement|sects]] within the [[Latter Day Saint movement]], rejected the Church's 1978 decision to allow African Americans to hold the priesthood and continue to deny activity in the church due to race.&lt;ref name="Primergroups"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=The Primer, Helping Victims of Domestic Violence and Child Abuse in Polygamous Communities: Fundamentalist Mormon Communities |url=http://attorneygeneral.utah.gov/cmsdocuments/The_Primer.pdf |publisher=Utah Attorney General's Office and Arizona Attorney General's Office |accessdate=29 June 2010 |date=June 2006 |page=41 |format=PDF |postscript=&lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter.

===Women===

[[File:Woman walking in Afghanistan.jpg|thumb|A woman with burqa on walking by the road in northern Afghanistan]]

The content of the [[Religious text|holy books]] of [[Abrahamic religions]] contain severe restrictions on the rights of women ranging from prohibiting women from certain behaviour and activities to requiring women to submit to the will of their father and or husband.

According to [[Polly Toynbee]], religion interferes with [[bodily autonomy]] for both genders and fosters particularly negative attitudes towards women's bodies. Toynbee writes: "Women's bodies are always the issue - too unclean to be bishops, and dangerous enough to be covered up by Islam and mikvahed by Judaism".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/oct/26/comment.politics|title=Polly Toynbee: A woman's supreme right over her own body and destiny is in jeopardy - Comment is free - The Guardian|author=Polly Toynbee|work=the Guardian|accessdate=30 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is argued that religious sexual discrimination leads to unequal relations in [[marriage]], creating norms which subordinate the wife to the husband. The word [[Wiktionary:בעל|בעל]] (''ba`al''), Hebrew for "husband", used throughout the Bible, is synonymous with "owner" and "master".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.questia.com/library/90607132/religion-and-sexism-images-of-woman-in-the-jewish|title=Religion and Sexism: Images of Woman in the Jewish and Christian Traditions|publisher=|accessdate=30 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This mirrors the abrahamic view of God as an omnipotent, perfect power, where this power is one of domination, which is persistently associated with the characteristics of ideal [[masculinity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/feminist-religion/#toc|title=Feminist Philosophy of Religion|publisher=|accessdate=30 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sheila Jeffreys]] argues: &lt;blockquote&gt;"Religion gives authority to traditional, patriarchal beliefs about the essentially subordinate nature of women and their naturally separate roles, such as the need for women to be confined to the private world of the home and family, that women should be obedient to their husbands, that women's sexuality should be modest and under the control of their menfolk, and that women should not use contraception or abortion to limit their childbearing. The practice of such ancient beliefs interferes profoundly with women's abilities to exercise their human rights".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/search?q=Man%27s+Dominion%3A+The+Rise+of+Religion+and+the+Eclipse+of+Women%27s+Rights&amp;btnG=Search+Books&amp;tbm=bks&amp;tbo=1|title=Man's Dominion: The Rise of Religion and the Eclipse of Women's Rights - Google Search|publisher=|accessdate=30 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

====Islam====
[[Feminism|Feminist]] [[Julie Bindel]] argues that religions encourage the domination of men over women and that Islam promotes the submission of women to their husbands and encourages practices such as [[child marriage]]. She wrote that religion "promotes inequality between men and women", that Islam's message for a woman includes that "she will be subservient to her husband and devote her life to pleasing him" and that "Islam's obsession with virginity and childbirth has led to gender segregation and early marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://standpointmag.co.uk/features-may-10-why-do-western-women-convert-julie-bindel-islam-female-conversion|title=Why do Western Women Convert? - Standpoint|publisher=|accessdate=30 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Islamic laws]] have been criticized by human rights organizations for exposing women to mistreatment and violence, preventing women from reporting rape and contributing to the discrimination of women.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/reports/afghanistan0312webwcover_0.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United Nations]] say that Islam is used to justify unnecessary and harmful [[female genital mutilation]], when the purposes range from deprivation of sexual satisfaction to discourage [[adultery]], insuring virginity to their husbands, or generating appearance of virginity.&lt;ref name="unfpa.org"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.unfpa.org/public/News/pid/280 | title=Statement on the International Day Against Female Genital Mutilation | first=Thoraya |last=Ahmed Obaid | publisher = [[United Nations Population Fund]] (UNFPA) | date=6 February 2007 | accessdate=2008-02-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Maryam Namazie]] argues that women are victimized under [[Sharia law]], both in criminal matters (such as punishment for improper veiling) and in civil matters; and also that women have judicial hurdles that are lenient or advantageous for men.&lt;ref name="onelawforall.org.uk"&gt;http://www.onelawforall.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/New-Report-Sharia-Law-in-Britain_fixed.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Phyllis Chesler]], Islam is connected to violence against women, especially in the form of honor killings. She rejects the argument that honor killings are not related to Islam and claims that while fundamentalists of all religions place restrictions on women, in Islam not only are these restrictions harsher, but Islam also reacts more violently when these rules are broken.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.meforum.org/2067/are-honor-killings-simply-domestic-violence|title=Are Honor Killings Simply Domestic Violence?|work=Middle East Forum|accessdate=30 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Christianity====

Christianity has been criticized for painting women as sinful, untrustful, deceiving and desiring to seduce and incite men into sexual sin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.academia.edu/2030628/The_Christian_Mens_Oldest_Prejudice_Misogyny_Hate_Or_Fear|title=The Christian Men's Oldest Prejudice: Misogyny, Hate Or Fear?|publisher=|accessdate=30 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Katharine M. Rogers argues that Christianity is misogynistic and that the "dread of female [[seduction]]" can be found in St. Paul's epistles.&lt;ref&gt;Rogers, Katharine M. ''The Troublesome Helpmate: A History of Misogyny in Literature,'' 1966.&lt;/ref&gt; K. K. Ruthven argues that the "legacy of Christian misogyny was consolidated by the so-called 'Fathers' of the Church, like [[Tertullian]], who thought a woman was not only 'the gateway of the devil' but also 'a temple built over a sewer'".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | url = https://books.google.com/?id=clOT7Hg2CfAC&amp;pg=PA83&amp;dq=christian+misogyny#v=onepage&amp;q=christian%20misogyny&amp;f=false | title = Feminist literary studies: An introduction | isbn = 978-0-521-39852-7 | author1 = Ruthven | first1 = K. K | year = 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jack Holland argues the concept of [[fall of man]] is misogynistic as "a myth that blames woman for the ills and sufferings of mankind".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Holland|first=Jack|title=Misogyny: The World's Oldest Prejudice|year=2006|publisher=Carroll &amp; Graf|location=New York|isbn=0-7867-1823-4|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Christian religious figures have been involved in the Middle Ages and early modern period [[Witch-hunt|witch trials]], which were generally used to punish assertive or independent women such as [[midwife|midwives]] since [[witchcraft]] was often not in evidence,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last=Teijlingen |first= Edwin R.| title=Midwifery and the medicalization of childbirth: comparative perspectives|year=2004|publisher=Nova Publishers|page=46}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[activists]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Eller|first=Cynthia|title=Living in the lap of the Goddess: the feminist spirituality movement in America|year=1995|publisher=Beacon Press|pages=170–175}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Shechita.JPG|thumb|180px|[[Shechita]] slaughter of a chicken]]
[[Shechita|Kosher slaughter]] has historically attracted criticism from non-Jews as allegedly being inhumane and unsanitary,&lt;ref name="Shechita-Poland"&gt;{{Cite book|title=No way out: the politics of Polish Jewry, 1935–1939|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=co3KJikOaBYC&amp;pg=PA81#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|first=Emanuel|last=Melzer|pages=81–90|year=1997|publisher=Hebrew Union College Press|isbn=0-87820-418-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; in part as an [[antisemitic canard]] that eating ritually slaughtered meat caused degeneration&lt;ref name=Poliakov&gt;{{Cite book|title=The History of Anti-semitism: From Voltaire to Wagner|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=w39m4aohL9gC&amp;pg=PA153#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|first=Léon|last=Poliakov|page=153|year=1968|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|isbn=0-8122-3766-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in part out of economic motivation to remove Jews from the meat industry.&lt;ref name="Shechita-Poland"/&gt; Sometimes these criticisms were directed at Judaism as a religion. In 1893, animal advocates campaigning against kosher slaughter in Aberdeen attempted to link cruelty with Jewish religious practice.&lt;ref name=Aberdeen&gt;{{Cite journal|title=A Community on Trial: The Aberdeen Shechita Case, 1893|url=http://www.euppublishing.com/doi/abs/10.3366/jshs.2010.0103|first=Kenneth|last=Collins|journal=[[Journal of Scottish Historical Studies]]|volume=30|pages=75–92|date=November 2010|doi=10.3366/jshs.2010.0103}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1920s, Polish critics of kosher slaughter claimed that the practice actually had no basis in Scripture.&lt;ref name="Shechita-Poland"/&gt; In contrast, Jewish authorities argue that the slaughter methods are based directly upon Genesis IX:3 and that "these laws are binding on Jews today".&lt;ref name=Chabad2/&gt;

While supporters of [[Shechita|kosher slaughter]] counter that [[Judaism]] requires the practice precisely because it is considered humane,&lt;ref name="Chabad2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/222241/jewish/Why-Do-Jews-Practice-Shechita.htm|title=Why Do Jews Practice Shechita?|author=Shechita UK|work=Chabad.org|publisher=Chabad-Lubavitch Media Center|accessdate=2012-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research conducted by [[Temple Grandin]] and Joe M. Regenstein in 1994 concluded that—practiced correctly with proper restraint systems—kosher slaughter results in little pain and suffering and notes that behavioral reactions to the incision made during kosher slaughter are less than those to noises such as clanging or hissing, inversion or pressure during restraint.&lt;ref name="Grandin"&gt;{{cite journal|first1=Temple |last1=Grandin |first2=Joe M. |last2=Regenstein|date=March 1994|title=Religious slaughter and animal welfare: a discussion for meat scientists.|journal=Meat Focus International|publisher=CAB International|pages=115–123|url=http://grandin.com/ritual/kosher.slaugh.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; those who practice and subscribe religiously and philosophically to [[Jewish vegetarianism]] disagree, stating that such slaughter is not required while a number, including medieval scholars of [[Judaism]] such as [[Joseph Albo]] and [[Isaac Arama]], regard vegetarianism as a moral [[ideal (ethics)|ideal]], not just out of a concern for [[animal welfare]], but also the slaughterer.&lt;ref name="innernet1"&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.innernet.org.il/article.php?aid=107 |title=Contemporary Halakhic Problems |volume=3 |last=Bleich |first=J. David |authorlink=J.

Other forms of [[ritual slaughter]], such as [[Ritual slaughter#Islamic .E1.B8.8Eab.C4.AB.E1.B8.A5ah|Islamic ritual slaughter]], have also come under controversy. Writing for [[PETA]], Logan Scherer said that animals sacrificed according to Islamic law can not be stunned before they are killed.&lt;ref name="PETA Islam animals"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.peta.org/b/thepetafiles/archive/2009/12/08/the-cruelty-behind-muslim-ritual-slaughter.aspx | title=The Cruelty Behind Muslim Ritual Slaughter | publisher=PETA | date=December 8, 2009 | accessdate=July 25, 2012 | author=Scherer, Logan}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Muslims are only allowed to eat meat that has been killed according to Sharia law and they say that Islamic law on ritual slaughter is designed to reduce the pain and distress that the animal suffers.&lt;ref name="BBC Islam Animals"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/islam/islamethics/animals_1.shtml | title=Treatment of animals: Islam and animals | publisher=BBC | date=August 13, 2009 | accessdate=July 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[Farm Animal Welfare Committee]], halal and kosher practices should be banned because when animals are not stunned before death, they suffer needless [[pain]] for up to 2 minutes despite some [[Muslims (ethnicity)|Muslims]] and [[Jews]] arguing that loss of blood from slash to the throat renders the animals unconscious relatively quickly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Halal and Kosher slaughter 'must end'|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/2977086.stm|publisher=BBC News | date=2003-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Response to criticism of morality===

Not all religions are hostile to homosexuality. Both [[Reform Judaism]] and the [[Unitarian Universalist Association]] have advocated for equal rights for gay and lesbian people since the 1970s.{{efn|In 1970, the UUA passed a resolution calling for an end to anti-gay discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.uua.org/lgbtq/witness/policy/facts&lt;/ref&gt; The Union for Reform Judaism passed a similar resolution in 1977.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.hrc.org/resources/stances-of-faiths-on-lgbt-issues-reform-judaism&lt;/ref&gt;}} [[Homosexuality and Hinduism|Hinduism]] does not view homosexuality as an issue.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rediff.com/news/1998/dec/04fire.htm] quote - "''Hinduism, unlike Christianity and Islam, does not view homosexuality as a religious sin.''"&lt;/ref&gt;

{{See also|Dominion theology|Christian reconstructionism}}
The term "[[dominionism]]" is often used to describe a political movement among [[fundamentalist Christianity|fundamentalist Christians]]. Critics view dominionism as an attempt to improperly impose Christianity as the national faith of the United States. It emerged in the late 1980s inspired by the book, film and lecture series "Whatever Happened to the Human Race?" by [[Francis Schaeffer|Francis A. Schaeffer]] and [[C. Everett Koop]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last =Diamond | first =Sara | authorlink =Sara Diamond |  title =Spiritual Warfare: The Politics of the Christian Right | publisher =[[South End Press]] | year =1989 | location =Boston | doi =  | id =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Schaeffer's views influenced conservatives like [[Jerry Falwell]], [[Pat Robertson]], [[Tim LaHaye]], [[Rutherford Institute|John W.

The '''death-positive movement''' is a [[Social movement|social]] and [[Philosophical movement|philosophical]] movement that encourages people to speak openly about death, dying, and corpses. The movement seeks to eliminate the silence around death-related topics, decrease anxiety surrounding death, and encourages more diversity in [[End-of-life care|end of life care]] options available to the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.talkdeath.com/death-positive-movement/|title=What is the Death Positive Movement?|date=2015-06-09|work=TalkDeath|access-date=2018-03-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
The word death positivity was popularized{{Dubious|date=March 2018}} by [[Caitlin Doughty]] as a play on the term [[Sex-positive movement|sex positivity]]. However, the ideas behind the movement have existed much longer. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.orderofthegooddeath.com/resources/death-positive-movement|title=Death Positive Movement - The Order of the Good Death|work=The Order of the Good Death|access-date=2018-03-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[The Order of the Good Death]] website lists the beliefs of the death-positive movement as being that cultural censorship of death and dying does more harm than good, that open discussions about death should be accepted as a natural human curiosity, that families should have full rights to care for the bodies of their loved ones without intervention from funeral businesses, and that end of life care should be diversified and performed in ways that cause less damage to the environment than our current practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.orderofthegooddeath.com/death-positive|title=Death Positive|last=|first=|date=|website=The Order of the Good Death|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The movement also strongly encourages participants to speak to their families about their own end of life wishes, even if they are young and healthy and is critical of the commercialized funeral industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/oct/27/caitlin-doughty-death-positivity|title=Welcome the reaper: Caitlin Doughty and the 'death-positivity' movement|last=Kelly|first=Kim|date=2017-10-27|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also encourages people to express their feelings about death through art.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.womenshealthmag.com/life/death-positivity-movement/slide/2|title=5 Stunning Pieces Of Art That Prove Death Doesn't Have To Be Sad|date=2018-02-08|work=Women's Health|access-date=2018-03-24|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Egg predation''' is a feeding strategy by [[animal]]s ('''ovivores''') including [[fish]], [[bird]]s, [[snake]]s and [[insect]]s, in which they consume the [[egg]]s of other species. Since an egg represents a complete [[organism]] at one stage of its [[Biological life cycle|life cycle]], eating an egg is a form of [[predation]], the killing of another organism for food.

Egg predation is found widely across the animal kingdom, including in insects such as ladybirds, molluscs such as the leech ''Cystobranchus virginicus'', fishes such as [[haddock]], snakes such as [[colubrid]]s, birds such as [[carrion crow]] and [[buzzard]], and mammals such as [[red fox]], [[badger]]s and [[pine marten]]s. Some species are specialist egg predators, but many more are generalists which take eggs when the opportunity arises.

Snakes specialising in egg predation have greatly reduced [[venom]], implying that the main function of venom is to subdue [[prey]].

==Ecological relationship==
[[File:Corvus ossifragus and egg.jpg|thumb|left|Generalist and omnivorous&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Goodwin, D. |year=1983 |title=Crows of the World |publisher=Queensland University Press |isbn=0-7022-1015-3 |page=92}}&lt;/ref&gt; predators like this fish crow, ''[[Corvus ossifragus]]'', eat eggs among many other prey when they have the opportunity.]]

Egg predation is an [[ecological relationship]] in which an animal (a [[predator]]) hunts for and eats the eggs of another (prey) species. This reduces the [[evolutionary fitness]] of the parents whose eggs are preyed on. Among birds such as [[Common eider|eider ducks]] in one study, half the individuals started a fresh clutch of eggs, always in a new nest, and they always avoided the area around the robbed nest.&lt;ref name="HanssenErikstad2012"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Hanssen | first=Sveinn Are | last2=Erikstad | first2=Kjell Einar | title=The long-term consequences of egg predation | journal=Behavioral Ecology | volume=24 | issue=2 | date=2012 | doi=10.1093/beheco/ars198 | pages=564–569}}&lt;/ref&gt; Egg predation rates can be high for ground-nesting birds such as the [[European golden plover]], ''Pluvialis apricaria'': in Norway 78.2% of nests of this species were preyed on. Experimental removal of two nest and egg predators, [[red fox]] and [[carrion crow]], in another study raised the percentage of pairs that fledged young from c. 18% to c. 75%. Population increases among many generalist predators such as [[buzzard]], [[badger]], carrion crow, [[pine marten]], [[raven]], and red fox in Scotland have contributed to the decline in several ground-nesting bird species by taking eggs, young, and sitting hen (female) birds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Ainsworth |first1=Gill |last2=Calladine |first2=John |last3=Martay |first3=Blaise |last4=Park |first4=Kirsty |last5=Redpath |first5=Steve |last6=Wernham |first6=Chris |last7=Wilson |first7=Mark |last8=Young |first8=Juliette |title=Understanding Predation {{!}} A  review  bringing  together  natural  science  and  local  knowledge  of recent  wild bird  population  changes  and  their  drivers  in  Scotland |date=2017 |publisher=Scotland's Moorland Forum |pages=233-234 |url=https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/jotter2.files/5055073?response-content-type=application%2Fpdf&amp;response-content-disposition=inline%3Bfilename%3D160205-up_report.pdf&amp;X-Amz-Content-Sha256=UNSIGNED-PAYLOAD&amp;X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&amp;X-Amz-Credential=AKIAIH4MJHC24RK4EHAA%2F20180910%2Feu-west-1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&amp;X-Amz-Date=20180910T133135Z&amp;X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&amp;X-Amz-Expires=3000&amp;X-Amz-Signature=7574fca291eb8464d6e11ad43bdc1c775af053e86fcdf8839e63cbae51a47f97}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among fish, egg predation by species such as [[haddock]] (''Melanogrammus aeglefinus'') can contribute to the decline in other fish populations such as of [[Atlantic herring]] (''Clupea harengus''). This effect can be important in attempts to restore fisheries damaged by [[overfishing]].&lt;ref name="Richardson Hare Fogarty Link pp. 13606–13611"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Richardson | first=D. E. | last2=Hare | first2=J. A. | last3=Fogarty | first3=M. J. | last4=Link | first4=J.

[[Invasive species]] such as the harlequin ladybird ''[[Harmonia axyridis]]'' frequently prey on eggs and young of native species, in its case including those of other ladybirds such as the two-spot ladybird ''[[Adalia bipunctata]]''. Females of the prey species laid eggs with higher amounts of defensive alkaloids when egg predation was occurring.&lt;ref name="Paul Stevens Burton Pell 2018"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Paul | first=Sarah C. | last2=Stevens | first2=Martin | last3=Burton | first3=Jake | last4=Pell | first4=Judith K. | last5=Birkett | first5=Michael A. | last6=Blount | first6=Jonathan D. | title=Invasive Egg Predators and Food Availability Interactively Affect Maternal Investment in Egg Chemical Defense | journal=Frontiers in Ecology and Evolution | volume=6 | date=2018 | doi=10.3389/fevo.2018.00004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some [[colubrid]] [[snake]]s such as the Formosa kukri snake ''[[Oligodon formosanus]]'' specialise in egg predation.&lt;ref name="Pike Clark Manica Tseng p. "&gt;{{cite journal | last=Pike | first=David A. | last2=Clark | first2=Rulon W. | last3=Manica | first3=Andrea | last4=Tseng | first4=Hui-Yun | last5=Hsu | first5=Jung-Ya | last6=Huang | first6=Wen-San | title=Surf and turf: predation by egg-eating snakes has led to the evolution of parental care in a terrestrial lizard | journal=Scientific Reports | volume=6 | issue=1 | date=2016-02-26 | doi=10.1038/srep22207}}&lt;/ref&gt; Egg predation by snakes is rarely opposed, but the Asian long-tailed skink ''[[Eutropis longicaudata]]'' aggressively protects its eggs from the Formosa kukri snake.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Snakes meet their match in offspring-protecting lizards |url=https://phys.org/news/2013-01-snakes-offspring-protecting-lizards.html |publisher=Phys.org |accessdate=11 September 2018 |date=30 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Huang Lin Dubey Pike pp. 429–437"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Huang | first=Wen-San | last2=Lin | first2=Si-Min | last3=Dubey | first3=Sylvain | last4=Pike | first4=David A. | editor-last=Coulson | editor-first=Tim | title=Predation drives interpopulation differences in parental care expression | journal=Journal of Animal Ecology | volume=82 | issue=2 | date=2012 | doi=10.1111/1365-2656.12015 | pages=429–437}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Egg-eating snakes such as the marbled sea snake ''[[Aipysurus eydouxii]]'' have atrophied [[venom]] glands; this has been explained as an evolutionary consequence of their diet, since venom is not required to subdue their prey, unlike the case in their venomous and conventionally predatory ancestors.&lt;ref name="Li Fry Kini 2005 pp. 81–89"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Li | first=Min | last2=Fry | first2=B.G. | last3=Kini | first3=R.

The aquatic [[piscicolidae|piscicolid]] [[leech]] ''[[Cystobranchus virginicus]]'' is an egg predator; it may be an obligate egg-feeder as it has not been seen feeding on an adult but has been found in the nests of a variety of species of North American freshwater fish of the genera ''[[Campostoma]]'' and ''[[Moxostoma]]''.&lt;ref name="Light Fiumera Porter pp. 50–56"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Light | first=Jessica E. | last2=Fiumera | first2=Anthony C. | last3=Porter | first3=Brady A. | title=Egg-feeding in the freshwater piscicolid leech Cystobranchus virginicus (Annelida, Hirudinea) | journal=Invertebrate Biology | volume=124 | issue=1 | date=2005 | doi=10.1111/j.1744-7410.2005.1241-06.x | pages=50–56}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Errázuriz studied at the ''Padres Franceses'', the [[Instituto Nacional]] and the [[Universidad de Chile]], where he graduated as a lawyer on March 26, 1873. In 1875, he married [[Gertrudis Echenique]], and together they had two children: Federico and Elena.&lt;ref&gt;Armando de Ramón, Biografías de chilenos, Miembros de los Poderes Ejecutivo, Legislativo y Judicial 1876-1973, Ediciones Universidad Católica de Chile, Santiago, 1999. (a) Volumen I: A-C; (b) Volumen II: D-K; (c) Volumen III: L-Q; (d) Volumen IV: R-Z; (e) Volumen V: Indices, apéndices y anexos&lt;/ref&gt; After the end of his studies, they moved to the [[hacienda]] of ''El Huique'', in the province of [[Colchagua Province|Colchagua]], which he would continue to manage until his death.

Errázuriz Echaurren joined the Liberal party and started his political life in 1876, when he was elected as a deputy for Constitución. He was reelected in 1879 and was characterized as a centrist politician. He did not participate in the campaigns of the [[War of the Pacific]], preferring instead to remain in his hacienda, but during the religious controversies between Church and State under President [[Domingo Santa María]], he joined the conservative forces. In August, 1890, President [[José Manuel Balmaceda]] named him [[Ministry of National Defense (Chile)#Ministers of War and Navy|Minister of War and Navy]], under the so-called ''conciliation cabinet'' of [[Belisario Prats]]; but when Prats resigned his position, so did Errázuriz, and both joined the opposition. In 1891 he was one of the signatories of the Act of Deposition of Presidente Balmaceda. Even so, he did not participate in the [[1891 Chilean Civil War]].

After the end of the civil war, he was elected deputy for Cauquenes and Constitución (1891–1894). His ill-health forced him to travel to [[Germany]], in search of specialists. During a year and a half, he travelled through Europe, even visiting Pope [[Leo XIII]]. He returned to Chile and in 1894 was elected Senator for Maule and designed Minister of Justice and Public Instruction, under President [[Jorge Montt]].

==Presidency==
{{main|Chilean presidential election, 1896}}
[[Image:ErrazurizEchaurrenFederico.jpg|thumb|200px|left|President Errázuriz Echaurren (1894)]]After a very contested election, Errázuriz Echaurren was elected [[President of Chile|President]] and assumed power on September 18, 1896. He took over his office at the age of 46, but by then he already was showing the symptoms of the illness that was going to kill him before the end of his mandate. Both his supporters and the opposition considered him a man of great political cunning, but while his supporters saw him as a true patriot, the opposition pictured him as a corrupt politician capable of the worst excesses. These characterizations made his rule difficult from the start, since he had a majority on the [[Senate of Chile|Senate]] but not on the [[Chamber of Deputies of Chile|Chamber of Deputies]]. He received a country where the economic situation had steadily worsened due to the progressive crisis of the nitrate industry and the associated unemployment and social crisis caused by it; while the international relationships with [[Perú]], [[Bolivia]] and [[Argentina]] were also in a critical state. To counteract the instability he tried to broaden the political consensus of his supporting coalition by forming a cabinet made up of three liberals and three conservatives, with the Liberal [[Aníbal Zañartu]] as [[Ministry of the Interior (Chile)|Minister of the Interior]]. This seemingly impeccable arrangement only lasted for two months. In what was the norm during the governments of the period, Errázuriz Echaurren went on to have 17 cabinets during his administration.

Between 1896 and 1897, he named [[Carlos Antúnez]] as his Minister of the Interior and charged him with guaranteeing free and "clean" elections. Antúnez was in charge until after the general election of March, 1897, considered his mission accomplished after and resigned. This elections were greeted with general pleasure, but did not change the political support for the government, so Errázuriz Echaurren had to continue trying to achieve a balance in order to maintain a semblance of political stability. In the course of this search, Errázuriz Echaurren became closer and closer to the Conservative Party, until in 1898 he named [[Carlos Walker Martínez]], president of the Conservatives as [[Ministry of the Interior (Chile)|Minister of the Interior]]. Nonetheless, he remained always loyal to the coalition that elected him, and for example never allowed any member of the [[Radical Party (Chile)|Radical party]] into any of his cabinets. Errázuriz's responses to the cabinet crisis, elections and in general to any problem within his administration was always consistent. He never took any decision without first consulting his political basis in congress, and always subordinated himself to the will of the political parties.

===Public policies===
Errázuriz's administration was characterized by a marked advancement in public education. Under his impulse, several institutions for the formation of health professionals were created, such as the courses for matrons and nurses, the ''{{lang|es|Escuela Profesional de Niñas}}'' of [[Valparaíso]] (Professional Institute for Girls), the ''Instituto Comercial'' of Santiago (Business Institute); and new high schools in Santiago and Iquique. This administration also contributed with new tram systems in Santiago, Valparaíso, San Felipe and San Bernardo. Errázuriz Echaurren contracted the new sewerage system for Santiago, and the water reservoir of Peñuelas, which still provides the water for Valparaíso.

He faced his biggest problems in the area of monetary policy. The much-wanted return to  the [[Gold standard|metallic conversion]], of which he was opposed but which was favored by the parliamentary majorities, was shelved due to the threat of a war with [[Argentina]]. The delay of the measure (until 1902) caused a public run on the banks, almost collapsing the banking system, and forcing the government to issue and put into circulation [[Banknote|paper money]].

===Argentine problem===
[[Image:Abrazo del Estrecho.jpg|thumb|300px|President Roca and President Errázuriz at the straits (1899)]]
The biggest problem that the administration had to face was on the international area.  Chile and [[Argentina]] were on the brink of war, due to long-standing border disputes stemming from the peace treaty of 1881, the situation of the ''Puna de Atacama'' (a disputed territory formerly owned by [[Bolivia]] and claimed by both countries) and [[Argentine–Chilean naval arms race|an ongoing naval arms race]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ffyh.unc.edu.ar/modernidades/VI/DEFINITIVOS/Floria.htm|title=''Abrazo del Estrecho''|website=Ffyh.unc.edu.ar|accessdate=2017-06-23|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070710051956/http://www.ffyh.unc.edu.ar/modernidades/VI/DEFINITIVOS/Floria.htm|archivedate=2007-07-10|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; President Errázuriz was avowedly pacifist, but at one point both countries actually got to the point where they called their reserve soldiers. The final solution was to submit the problem to an arbitration by the King of England, the adjudication of which was not resolved until 1902, during the administration of [[Germán Riesco]], President Errázuriz's cousin and successor.

To celebrate the decision to arbitrate and avoid war, Presidente Errázuriz and [[Argentina|Argentinian]] President [[Julio Argentino Roca]] held an international meeting in the [[Strait of Magellan]]. This meeting is known as the [[Embrace of the Strait]] ({{lang-es|El Abrazo del Estrecho}}) and took place in front of the city of [[Punta Arenas, Chile|Punta Arenas]] on February 15, 1899.

===Succession controversy===
As most presidents of the time, he became involved early in the election of his successor.  The Liberal-Conservative Coalition that supported him went on to proclaim [[Germán Riesco]], cousin and brother-in-law of President Errázuriz, as their candidate on March 8, 1901. The President responded on a public letter: ''...as I have the firm purpose of not intervening in any political campaign and I don't have or want to have any candidate, I am firmly resolved to prevent the participation of any member of this administration in the upcoming elections''.

===Health problems and death===
Errázuriz's ill-health continued to plague him during all his period. Before his election, he already had had to travel to [[Germany]] in 1893 for treatment, and the death of his oldest son from [[tuberculosis]] in 1897 weakened him further. On June 11, 1900 he had to delegate his mandate on [[Elías Fernández]], who assumed as Vice President, so he could travel again to seek medical advise. He reassumed his duties on October 11 of the same year, but died suddenly of cerebral [[thrombosis]] on July 12, 1901 while in [[Valparaíso]]. He was constitutionally replaced by his [[Ministry of the Interior (Chile)|Minister of the Interior]] [[Aníbal Zañartu]], who assumed as [[President of Chile|Vice President]] for the remainder of his mandate.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12562">'''Frankfurt cases''' (also known as '''Frankfurt counterexamples''' or '''Frankfurt-style cases''') were presented by [[philosophy|philosopher]] [[Harry Frankfurt]] in 1969 as counterexamples to the '''principle of alternate possibilities''' ('''PAP'''), which holds that an agent is [[moral responsibility|morally responsible]] for an action only if that person could have done otherwise.

==Principle of alternate possibilities==
The principle of alternate possibilities (PAP) forms part of an influential argument for the incompatibility of responsibility and causal [[determinism]], often called the ''core argument'' for [[incompatibilism]].&lt;ref name=Copp/&gt;&lt;ref name=Harrison/&gt;&lt;ref name=Timpe/&gt; It was formulated by [[Libertarianism (metaphysics)|Libertarian]] [[Robert Kane (philosopher)|Robert Kane]]. This argument is detailed below:

(1) '''PAP''': An agent is responsible for an action only if said agent could have done otherwise.&lt;ref name=Frankfurt/&gt;

(2) An agent could have done otherwise only if causal determinism is false.

(3) Therefore, an agent is responsible for an action only if causal determinism is false.

Traditionally, [[compatibilism|compatibilists]] (defenders of the compatibility of [[free will]] and determinism, like [[A. J. Ayer]], [[Walter Terence Stace]], and [[Daniel Dennett]]) reject premise two, arguing that, properly understood, free will is not incompatible with determinism.  According to the traditional compatibilist analysis of free will, an agent is free to do otherwise when he would have done otherwise had he wanted to do otherwise.&lt;ref name=Ayer/&gt; Agents may possess free will, according to the conditional analysis, even if determinism is true.

==Frankfurt's objection==
From the PAP definition "a person is morally responsible for what he has done only if he could have done otherwise", Frankfurt infers that a person is not morally responsible for what he has done if he could not have done otherwise – a point with which he takes issue: our theoretical ability to do otherwise, he says, does not necessarily make it ''possible'' for us to do otherwise.

Frankfurt's examples are significant because they suggest an alternative way to defend the compatibility of moral responsibility and determinism, in particular by rejecting the first premise of the argument.  According to this view, responsibility is compatible with determinism because responsibility does not require the freedom to do otherwise.

Frankfurt's examples involve agents who are intuitively responsible for their behavior even though they lack the freedom to act otherwise.  Here is a typical case:

:Donald is a Democrat and is likely to vote for the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]]; in fact, only in one particular circumstance will he not: that is, if he thinks about the prospects of immediate American defeat in [[Iraq]] just prior to voting.  Ms White, a representative of the Democratic Party, wants to ensure that Donald votes Democratic, so she secretly plants a device in Donald's head that, if activated, will force him to vote Democratic.  Not wishing to reveal her presence unnecessarily, Ms White plans to activate the device only if Donald thinks about the [[Iraq War]] prior to voting.  As things happen, Donald does not think about Iraq prior to voting, so Ms White thus sees no reason to activate the device, and Donald votes Democratic of his own accord.  Apparently, Donald is responsible for voting Democratic although, owing to Ms. White's device, he lacks freedom to do otherwise.

If Frankfurt is correct in suggesting both that Donald is morally responsible for voting Democratic and that he is not free to do otherwise, moral responsibility, in general, does not require that an agent have the freedom to do otherwise (that is, the principle of alternate possibilities is false).  Thus, even if causal determinism is true, and even if determinism removes the freedom to do otherwise, there is no reason to doubt that people can still be morally responsible for their behavior.

Having presented his counter argument against the principle of alternate possibilities, Frankfurt suggests that it be revised to take into account the fallacy of the notion that coercion precludes an agent from moral responsibility.  It must be ''only because'' of coercion that the agent acts as he does.  The best definition, by his reckoning, is this: "[A] person is not morally responsible for what he has done if he did it ''only because'' he could not have done otherwise."&lt;ref name=Frankfurt/&gt;

==Criticism==
One of the first objections raised by opponents of the Frankfurt-style cases is the two-horned dilemma. This objection was most notably raised by philosophers such as Widerker, Ginet, and Kane.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Significance of Free Will|last=Kane|first=Robert|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1996|isbn=|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ginet|first=Carl|date=1996|title=In Defense of the Principle of Alternative Possibilities: Why I Don't Find Frankfurt's Argument Convincing|url=|journal=Philosophical Perspectives|volume=10|pages=403-417|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Widerker|first=David|date=1995|title=Libertarianism and Frankfurt's Attack on the Principle of Alternative Possibilities|url=|journal=Philosophical Review|volume=104|pages=247-261|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two-horned dilemma focuses on the connection between the agent's inclination and the agent's decision. This connection can be either deterministic or indeterministic.

If the connection between the agent's inclination and the agent's decision is deterministic, then proponents of the Frankfurt-style cases are charged with begging the question. A deterministic connection begs the question because proponents of Frankfurt-style cases are assuming the very thing that is being debated, that moral responsibility does not require alternate possibilities or the ability to do otherwise. Suppose the agent's inclination is causally sufficient for bringing about the agent's decision. This would mean that the agent was determined to make that decision prior to any kind of decision-making. Thus, the agent did not freely come to the decision for reasons of her own. Opponents of the Frankfurt-style cases would immediately contend that the agent is not morally responsible. This is because they are operating from the get-go that moral responsibility requires free will. Therefore, if the Frankfurt-style cases are operating within a metaphysically deterministic framework, then proponents of Frankfurt-style cases cannot reasonably expect their opponents to be convinced. Furthermore, Frankfurt-style cases would be begging the question since they are deriving moral responsibility from a completely deterministic scenario. 

On the other hand, if the connection between the agent's inclination and the agent's decision is indeterministic, then opponents of the Frankfurt-style cases argue that the agent has the ability to do otherwise. This is problematic for proponents of the Frankfurt-style cases because they are supposed to show a situation where an agent is morally responsible her decision and yet is unable to truly do otherwise. Suppose the agent's inclination and the agent's decision is indeterministic. This means that the agent's inclination is not necessarily indicative of what the agent's decision will be. Thus, it is possible for the agent to show the correct inclination, evade the computer device, but then make the "wrong" decision. Even if the computer device kicks in after the "wrong decision," the agent still encountered the ability to do otherwise. This kind of Frankfurt-style case would fail to present a situation where an agent is morally responsible while lacking alternate possibilities. 

== Responses ==
There have been a number of responses to the two-horned dilemma. One response has been to argue that a deterministic connection does not actually beg the question. Fischer has argued for this response by arguing that the Frankfurt-style case cannot stand alone, but must be taken in conjunction with other arguments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fischer|first=Martin|date=1999|title=Recent Work on Moral Responsibility|url=|journal=Ethics|volume=110|pages=93-139|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These other arguments are supposed to show that causal determinism in and of itself and apart from ruling out alternate possibilities does not threaten moral responsibility. 

A second response is to revise the Frankfurt-style cases. This revision consist in creating a case with an explicit indeterministic connection where the agent is still morally responsible without any alternate possibilities. These kind of Frankfurt-style cases do it by incorporating buffer zones that act to eliminate alternate possibilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hunt|first=David|date=2005|title=Moral Responsibility and Buffered Alternatives|url=|journal=Midwest Studies in Philosophy|volume=29|pages=126-145|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The success of these responses are still being debated. It remains to be seen whether the Frankfurt style cases are successfully in showing what Harry Frankfurt intended them to show.

== Legacy ==
[[Michael Otsuka]] provides a more specific answer to proposed problems with Frankfurt's counterexamples.  In his article, Otsuka says,&lt;ref name=Otsuka/&gt;
"my strategy is to propose that the Principle of Alternate Possibilities be rejected in favor of a different incompatibilist principle,"  that is, different from Frankfurt's, "that I call the 'Principle of Avoidable Blame'."

In '''ABO hemolytic disease of the newborn''' (also known as ABO HDN) maternal [[IgG]] [[antibodies]] with specificity for the [[ABO blood group system]] pass through the [[placenta]] to the [[fetal]] circulation where they can cause [[hemolysis]] of fetal [[red blood cells]] which can lead to fetal [[anemia]] and [[Hemolytic disease of the newborn|HDN]]. In contrast to [[Rh disease]], about half of the cases of ABO HDN occur in a firstborn baby and ABO HDN does not become more severe after further pregnancies.

The ABO blood group system is the best known surface antigen system, expressed on a wide variety of human cells. For [[Caucasian race|Caucasian]] populations about one fifth of all pregnancies have ABO incompatibility between the fetus and the mother, but only a very small minority develop symptomatic ABO HDN.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.obgyn.net/english/pubs/features/presentations/panda13/ABO-Rh.ppt{{full citation needed|date=February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The latter typically only occurs in mothers of blood group O, because they can produce enough IgG antibodies to cause hemolysis.

Although very uncommon, cases of ABO HDN have been reported in infants born to mothers with blood groups A&lt;ref name=pmid16007582&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/pbc.20503 |pmid=16007582 |title=Hemolytic disease of the newborn caused by a high titer anti-group B IgG from a group a mother |journal=Pediatric Blood &amp; Cancer |volume=45 |issue=6 |pages=861–2 |year=2005 |last1=Wang |first1=Michael |last2=Hays |first2=Taru |last3=Ambruso |first3=Dan R. |last4=Silliman |first4=Christopher C. |last5=Dickey |first5=William C. }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jeon"&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=15373613 |year=2000 |author1=Jeon |first1=H |title=Significant ABO hemolytic disease of the newborn in a group B infant with a group A2 mother |journal=Immunohematology |volume=16 |issue=3 |pages=105–8 |last2=Calhoun |first2=B |last3=Pothiawala |first3=M |last4=Herschel |first4=M |last5=Baron |first5=B.

==Causes==
;Environmental exposure: Anti-A and anti-B antibodies are usually [[IgM]] and do not pass through the placenta, but some mothers "naturally" have [[IgG]] anti-A or IgG anti-B antibodies, which can pass through the placenta.  Exposure to A-antigens and B-antigens, which are both widespread in nature, usually leads to the production of IgM anti-A and IgM anti-B antibodies but occasionally IgG antibodies are produced.

;Fetal-maternal transfusion: Some mothers may be sensitized by fetal-maternal transfusion of ABO incompatible red blood and produce immune IgG antibodies against the antigen they do not have and their baby does.  For example, when a mother of genotype OO ([[ABO blood group system|blood group O]]) carries a fetus of genotype AO (blood group A) she may produce IgG anti-A antibodies.  The father will either have blood group A, with genotype AA or AO or, more rarely, have blood group AB, with genotype AB.

;Blood transfusion: It would be very rare for ABO sensitization to be due to therapeutic [[blood transfusion]] as a great deal of effort and checking is done to ensure that blood is ABO compatible between the recipient and the donor.

==Moderating factors==
In about a third of all ABO incompatible pregnancies maternal IgG anti-A or IgG anti-B antibodies pass through the placenta to the fetal circulation leading to a weakly positive [[Coombs test#Direct Coombs|direct Coombs test]] for the neonate's blood.  However, ABO HDN is generally mild and short-lived and only occasionally severe because:
* IgG anti-A (or IgG anti-B) antibodies that enter the fetal circulation from the mother find A (or B) antigens on many different fetal cell types, leaving fewer antibodies available for binding onto fetal red blood cells.&lt;ref name="bethesda2005"&gt;{{cite book|author=Bethesda DL|title=Blood Groups and Red Cell Antigens|chapter=Hemolytic disease of the newborn|publisher=National Center for Biotechnology Information|year=2005|chapter-url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK2266/}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Fetal [[red blood cell|RBC]] surface A and B [[antigens]] are not fully developed during gestation and so there are a smaller number of antigenic sites on fetal RBCs.&lt;ref name="bethesda2005"/&gt;

==Diagnosis==
Routine [[obstetrics|antenatal]] antibody screening blood tests ([[Coombs test#Indirect Coombs test|indirect Coombs test]]) do not screen for ABO HDN.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}  If IgG anti-A or IgG anti-B antibodies are found in the pregnant woman's blood, they are not reported with the test results, because they do not correlate well with ABO HDN.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}  Diagnosis is usually made by investigation of a newborn baby who has developed [[jaundice]] during the first week of life.

'''Testing'''
*Coombs - after birth baby will have a direct coombs test run to confirm antibodies attached to the infant’s red blood cells. This test is run from cord blood.&lt;ref name=pmid17337672&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1136/adc.2005.076794 |pmid=17337672 |pmc=2675453 |title=Haemolytic disease of the newborn |journal=Archives of Disease in Childhood: Fetal and Neonatal Edition |volume=92 |issue=2 |pages=F83–8 |year=2007 |last1=Murray |first1=N. A |last2=Roberts |first2=I. A G }}&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases, the direct coombs will be negative but severe, even fatal HDN can occur.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1365-3148.1995.tb00197.x |pmid=7655573 |title=Three examples of Rh haemolytic disease of the newborn with a negative direct antiglobulin test |journal=Transfusion Medicine |volume=5 |issue=2 |pages=113–6 |year=1995 |last1=Heddle |first1=N.

Anti-M also recommends antigen testing to rule out the presence of HDN.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.4103/0973-6247.150968 |pmid=25722586 |pmc=4339947 |title=Maternal anti-M induced hemolytic disease of newborn followed by prolonged anemia in newborn twins |journal=Asian Journal of Transfusion Science |volume=9 |issue=1 |pages=98–101 |year=2015 |last1=Arora |first1=Satyam |last2=Doda |first2=Veena |last3=Maria |first3=Arti |last4=Kotwal |first4=Urvershi |last5=Goyal |first5=Saurabh }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*Hgb - the infant’s hemoglobin should be tested from cord blood.&lt;ref name=pmid17337672/&gt;
*Reticulocyte count - Reticulocytes are elevated when the infant is producing more blood to combat anemia.&lt;ref name=pmid17337672/&gt; A rise in the retic count can mean that an infant may not need additional transfusions.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ucsfbenioffchildrens.org/pdf/manuals/42_Hemol.pdf{{full citation needed|date=February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Low retic is observed in infants treated with IUT and in those with HDN from anti-Kell&lt;ref name=emedicine974349workup/&gt;
*Neutrophils - as Neutropenia is one of the complications of HDN, the neutrophil count should be checked.&lt;ref name=pmid2494315&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=2494315 |year=1989 |author1=Koenig |first1=J.

H. }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Thrombocytes - as thrombocytopenia is one of the complications of HDN, the thrombocyte count should be checked.&lt;ref name=pmid2494315/&gt;
*Bilirubin should be tested from cord blood.&lt;ref name=pmid17337672/&gt;
*Ferritin - because most infants affected by HDN have iron overload, a ferritin must be run before giving the infant any additional iron.&lt;ref name=pmid23802744&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/vox.12061 |pmid=23802744 |title=Iron status in infants with alloimmune haemolytic disease in the first three months of life |journal=Vox Sanguinis |volume=105 |issue=4 |pages=328–33 |year=2013 |last1=Rath |first1=M.

*Newborn Screening Tests - Transfusion with donor blood during pregnancy or shortly after birth can affect the results of the Newborn Screening Tests. It is recommended to wait and retest 10–12 months after last transfusion. In some cases, DNA testing from saliva can be used to rule out certain conditions.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

==Treatment==
The antibodies in ABO HDN cause [[anemia]] due to destruction of fetal red blood cells and [[Neonatal jaundice|jaundice]] due to the rise in blood levels of [[bilirubin]] a by-product of [[hemoglobin]] break down. If the anemia is severe, it can be treated with a blood transfusion, however this is rarely needed. On the other hand, neonates have underdeveloped livers that are unable to process large amounts of bilirubin and a poorly developed [[blood-brain barrier]] that is unable to block bilirubin from entering the brain.This can result in [[kernicterus]] if left unchecked. If the bilirubin level is sufficiently high as to cause worry, it can be lowered via [[Neonatal jaundice#Phototherapy|phototherapy]] in the first instance or an [[Neonatal jaundice#Exchange transfusions|exchange transfusion]] if severely elevated.

*Phototherapy - Phototherapy is used for cord bilirubin of 3 or higher. Some doctors use it at lower levels while awaiting lab results.&lt;ref name=pmid15231951&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=15231951 |url=http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=15231951 |year=2004 |author1=American Academy of Pediatrics Subcommittee on Hyperbilirubinemia. |title=Management of hyperbilirubinemia in the newborn infant 35 or more weeks of gestation |journal=Pediatrics |volume=114 |issue=1 |pages=297–316 |doi=10.1542/peds.114.1.297}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*IVIG - Intravenous Immunoglobulin therapy (IVIG) has been used to successfully treat many cases of HDN. It has been used not only on anti-D, but on anti-E as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.3109/14767050903544751 |pmid=20092394 |title=Intravenous Immunoglobulin therapy for anti-E hemolytic disease in the newborn |journal=The Journal of Maternal-Fetal &amp; Neonatal Medicine |volume=23 |issue=9 |pages=1059–61 |year=2010 |last1=Onesimo |first1=Roberta |last2=Rizzo |first2=Daniela |last3=Ruggiero |first3=Antonio |last4=Valentini |first4=Piero }}&lt;/ref&gt; IVIG can be used to reduce the need for exchange transfusion and to shorten the length of phototherapy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1136/fn.88.1.F6 |pmid=12496219 |pmc=1755998 |title=Systematic review of intravenous immunoglobulin in haemolytic disease of the newborn |journal=Archives of Disease in Childhood: Fetal and Neonatal Edition |volume=88 |issue=1 |pages=F6–10 |year=2003 |last1=Gottstein |first1=R }}&lt;/ref&gt; The AAP recommends "In isoimmune hemolytic disease, administration of intravenous γ-globulin (0.5-1 g/kg over 2 hours) is recommended if the TSB is rising despite intensive phototherapy or the TSB level is within 2 to 3 mg/dL (34-51 μmol/L) of the exchange level . If necessary, this dose can be repeated in 12 hours (evidence quality B: benefits exceed harms). Intravenous γ-globulin has been shown to reduce the need for exchange transfusions in Rh and ABO hemolytic disease."&lt;ref name=pmid15231951/&gt;
*Exchange transfusion - Exchange transfusion is used when bilirubin reaches either the high or medium risk lines on the normogram provided by the American Academy of Pediatrics (Figure 4).&lt;ref name=pmid15231951/&gt; Cord bilirubin &gt;4 is also indicative of the need for exchange transfusion.&lt;ref&gt;{{EMedicine|article|974349|Hemolytic Disease of Newborn|followup}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Physiology==
Crying may elicit the [[Valsalva maneuver|Valsalva reflex]]. This reflex negatively impacts [[breastfeeding|sucking]] [[Suction|pressure]]s and results in poor feeding. The [[cortisol]] levels will rise along with [[blood pressure]]. Increased blood pressure will have an effect on [[cerebral blood flow]], [[cerebral blood flow velocity]] and [[intracranial pressure]]. Increased pressures and velocity can lead to [[intracranial hemmorrhage]]. Prolonged exhalation may also cause some [[adverse effect]]s. Obstructed [[venous return]] and quick inspiratory gasp can occur. [[Foramen ovale (heart)|Foramen ovale]] shunting can occur.{{sfn | Walker | page = 210}} Adults can often determine whether an infant's cries signify [[anger]] or [[pain]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Zeskind|first=P.

==Misconceptions==
Misconceptions regarding the purpose of crying in the infant are common among caregivers and medical personnel.

===Colic===
{{Main|Colic}}
The term 'colic' was defined in 1954 as: " crying for more than three hours per day, for more than three days per week, and for more than three weeks in an infant that is well-fed and otherwise healthy."&lt;ref name = roberts/&gt; Colic and excessive crying by infants is synonymous to some clinicians.&lt;ref name=Gri2014&gt;{{cite book|last1=Grimes|first1=edited by Frank Domino, Robert A.

==Maternal responses==
Crying in infants is associated with high stress levels and depression in mothers.&lt;ref name=AFP2015&gt;{{cite journal| url= http://www.aafp.org/afp/2015/1001/p577.html|last1=Johnson|first1=JD|last2=Cocker|first2=K|last3=Chang|first3=E|title=Infantile Colic: Recognition and Treatment|journal=American Family Physician|date=1 October 2015 |accessdate = 22 July 2017| volume=92|issue=7|pages=577–82|pmid=26447441}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = hu&gt;{{cite journal|title=Maternal anxiety versus depressive disorders: specific relations to infants' crying, feeding and sleeping problems|first1=J.|last1=Petzoldt|first2=H.-U.|last2=Wittchen|first3=F.|last3=Einsle|first4=J.|last4=Martini|date=1 March 2016|journal=Child: Care, Health and Development|volume=42|issue=2|pages=231–245|doi=10.1111/cch.12292|pmid=26490836}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = clara/&gt;&lt;ref name=cook&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cook|first1=Fallon|last2=Seymour|first2=Monique|last3=Giallo|first3=Rebecca|last4=Cann|first4=Warren|last5=Nicholson|first5=Jan M.|last6=Green|first6=Julie|last7=Hiscock|first7=Harriet|title=Comparison of methods for recruiting and engaging parents in online interventions: study protocol for the Cry Baby infant sleep and settling program|journal=BMC Pediatrics|volume=15|issue=1|pages=174|year=2015|doi=10.1186/s12887-015-0502-9|pmid=26556032|pmc=4640160}}&lt;/ref&gt; Excessive crying has also been linked to maternal "physical aggression" and "angry speaking". The burden of care of the mother, that is, mothers without assistance in caring for the infant, are more prone to physical aggression and angry speaking.&lt;ref name=clara/&gt; During evaluations of maternal depression responses to infant crying, sleeping problems are closely associated with excessive crying and may confound the conclusions of such research. Also, it is not always clear that when sleeping problems are associated with infant crying, whether the sleeping problems are descriptive of the mother or the infant or both.&lt;ref name = hu/&gt; Maternal stress is associated with excessive crying.&lt;ref name=Ia2012&gt;{{cite journal|last=Iacovou|first=M|author2=Ralston, RA |author3=Muir, J |author4=Walker, KZ |author5= Truby, H |title=Dietary management of infantile colic: a systematic review.|journal=Maternal and Child Health Journal|date=August 2012|volume=16|issue=6|pages=1319–31|pmid=21710185|doi=10.1007/s10995-011-0842-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effects on young children==
One definition used to study excessive crying in infants is crying for three or more hours per 24 hours. Excessive infant crying has been associated with a twofold increased risk of the overall problem behavior, conduct problems, hyperactivity, and mood problems at the age of 5–6. Excessive infant crying doubles the risk of behavioral, hyperactivity, and mood problems at the age of 5–6, as reported by their mother. Excessive crying is not the only factor in later childhood difficulties. Behavioral problems in childhood include the so-called regulatory problems, such as excessive crying, sleeping, and feeding problems, which occur in 20% of infants in multiproblem families. Excessive crying, whining and sleeping problems at 4–6 months are associated with decreased social development at 12 months.&lt;ref name=clara/&gt;

Several factors may contribute to, and partly explain, an association between excessive infant crying and later behavioral and emotional problems. During early infancy, the quality of the mother–child dyad can be considered to be a crucial vehicle for child’s healthy mental development. Both early maternal and early paternal reciprocity in infancy are predictive of social competence and lower aggression in preschoolers.&lt;ref name=clara/&gt;

Compared to other infants, excessive crying infants had a slightly lower birth weight and a slightly younger gestational age. Excessive crying infants more often had a single, lower educated mother, originating from a non-industrialized country, who reported more depression, a higher burden of infant care, and more aggressive behavior and had an authoritarian parenting style. Excessive crying was associated with a higher risk for hyperactivity/inattention problems, emotional symptoms, conduct problems, peer relationship problems, and overall problem behavior at the age of 5–6, as well as a higher risk for decreased pro-social behavior as reported by the mother. Excessive crying was also associated with mood problems as well as generalized anxiety problems at the age of 5–6.&lt;ref name = clara/&gt;

==Abuse==
{{Main|Abusive head trauma}}

===Normal crying===
The physical abuse of infants is related to crying.&lt;ref name = reij&gt;{{cite journal|title=Infant crying and abuse|first1=Sijmen A.|last1=Reijneveld|first2=Marcel F.|last2=van der Wal|first3=Emily|last3=Brugman|first4=Remy A. Hira|last4=Sing|first5=S. Pauline|last5=Verloove-Vanhorick|journal=Lancet |volume=364|issue=9442|pages=1340–1342|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(04)17191-2|pmid=15474137|year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Crying may be related to the abusive head trauma in infants. This is the most common cause of child abuse death. Fathers are often the ones who shake the infant. Shaking may occur many times. This shaking can cause serious injuries in almost 50% of the time. Some caregivers are unaware that shaking the baby can seriously harm or kill the infant. This type of abuse is being addressed by efforts to educate parents and caregivers with educational flyers and videos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Parents' behavior in response to infant crying: Abusive head trauma education|first1=Hina|last1=Simonnet|first2=Anne|last2=Laurent-Vannier|first3=Wenlun|last3=Yuan|first4=Marie|last4=Hully|first5=Sakil|last5=Valimahomed|first6=Malek|last6=Bourennane|first7=Mathilde|last7=Chevignard|date=1 December 2014|journal=Child Abuse &amp; Neglect|volume=38|issue=12|pages=1914–1922|doi=10.1016/j.chiabu.2014.06.002|pmid=25043922}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prevention and treatment==
Infant crying is worse in the first few months of life, but improves as the child grows. A baby can sometimes be calmed by rocking gently, offering a pacifier, singing or talking softly, taking a walk with a stroller, or going for a drive in the car. If a baby won’t stop crying, it can be sick and seen by a doctor. Frustration and stress can be overwhelming for those with a crying infant. If caregivers feel as if they may lose control there are preventative measures that can be taken. The caregiver may benefit by calling a friend, relative, neighbor, or parent helpline for support. Another suggestion is to  put the baby in a safe place and walk away. The baby can be checked  every 5 to 10 minutes. 
Babies may be in danger if a person who is easily irritated or has a temper or history of violence cares for or watches the baby.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/childmaltreatment/abusive-head-trauma.html {{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When "normal" causes of excessive crying are ruled out, some caregivers adopt alternative and complementary treatments for excessive crying. Those practices include: 
* Eliminating milk products, eggs, wheat, and nuts from the diet of breastfeeding mothers
* Feeding infants fiber-enriched formula; not proven to be of benefit for most infants
* Counseling parents about specific colic-management techniques; not proven to be effective for most infants
* Infant massage; not proven to be effective or recommended&lt;ref name = roberts/&gt;

Those who realize that an infant can be in a situation where abuse is a possibility, support can be offered to give a parent or caregiver a break when needed. Education and understanding can let the parent know that dealing with a crying baby can be very frustrating—especially when they are tired or stressed, but infant crying is normal and it will pass. Parents can be encouraged to take a calming break if needed while the baby is safe in the crib. Others can be sensitive and supportive in situations when parents are trying to calm a crying baby.

In [[maximum parsimony]], an '''informative site''' is a position in the relevant set of sequences at which there are at least two different [[character state]]s at that point in the sequences, and each of those states occurs in at least two of the sequences. Character states can take on multiple types of data, including [[Morphology_(biology)|morphological]] (such as the presence of wings, tentacles, etc.) or [[Molecular phylogenetics|molecular information]] such as sequences of [[DNA]] or [[proteins]].
[[File:Parsimony informative v1.svg|thumb|Example of parsimony informative sites. In phylogenetics, parsimony informative sites are those with at least two states. Here, this is sites 2 and 4. Site 2 indicates a grouping of Species A and C, while site 4 indicates a grouping of Species A and B. Because these two sites conflict, other analyses (such as [[maximum likelihood]]) are needed to resolve the phylogenetic tree of these four species.]]

The '''Japanese submarine ''I-184''''' (originally '''''I-84''''') was a [[Kaidai type submarine|''Kaidai'' type]] [[cruiser submarine]] of the KD7 [[ship class|sub-class]] built for the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] (IJN) during the 1940s. She was sunk with all hands by an American [[torpedo bomber]] during the [[Battle of the Philippine Sea]] in mid-1944.

The submarines of the KD7 sub-class were medium-range attack submarines developed from the preceding KD6 sub-class. They [[Displacement (ship)|displaced]] {{Convert|1833|LT|t|0|disp=flip|sp=us}} surfaced and {{Convert|2602|LT|t|0|disp=flip|sp=us}} submerged. The submarines were {{convert|105.5|m|ftin|sp=us}} long, had a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|8.25|m|ftin|sp=us}} and a [[draft (hull)|draft]] of {{convert|4.6|m|ftin|sp=us}}. The boats had a diving depth of {{convert|80|m|ft|abbr=on}} and a complement of 86 officers and crewmen.&lt;ref name=cd3&gt;Carpenter &amp; Polmar, p. 105&lt;/ref&gt;

For surface running, the boats were powered by two {{convert|4000|bhp|lk=in|0|adj=on}} [[diesel engine]]s, each driving one [[propeller shaft]]. When submerged each propeller was driven by a {{convert|900|hp|0|adj=on}} [[electric motor]]. They could reach {{convert|23|kn|lk=in}} on the surface and {{convert|8|kn}} underwater. On the surface, the KD7s had a range of {{convert|8000|nmi|lk=in}} at {{convert|16|kn}}; submerged, they had a range of {{convert|50|nmi|abbr=on}} at {{convert|5|kn}}.&lt;ref name=c5&gt;Chesneau, p. 199&lt;/ref&gt;

The boats were armed with six internal {{convert|53.3|cm|in|1|abbr=on|sp=us}} [[torpedo tube]]s, all in the bow. They carried one reload for each tube; a total of a dozen [[torpedo]]es. They were originally intended to be armed with two twin-gun mounts for the [[Type 96 25 mm AT/AA Gun|{{convert|25|mm|abbr=on|1}} Type 96]] [[anti-aircraft gun]], but a [[Type 3 120 mm 45 caliber naval gun|{{convert|120|mm|in|abbr=on}}]] [[deck gun]] for combat on the surface was substituted for one 25&amp;nbsp;mm mount during construction.&lt;ref name=b4&gt;Bagnasco, pp. 183, 186&lt;/ref&gt;

==Construction and career==
Built by the [[Yokosuka Naval Arsenal]], the boat was [[laid down]] as ''I-84'' and renamed ''I-184'' in 1942.&lt;ref name=cd3/&gt; She was [[Ship naming and launching|launched]] on 12 December 1942 and completed on 15 October 1943.&lt;ref name=j5&gt;Jentschura, Jung &amp; Mickel, p. 172&lt;/ref&gt; The boat was sunk with the loss of all 96 officers and crewmen aboard by a [[Grumman TBF Avenger]] [[torpedo bomber]] from the [[escort carrier]] {{USS|Suwanee|CVE-27|6}} {{convert|20|mi}} southeast of [[Saipan]] on 19 June 1944. ''I-184'' was stricken from the [[Navy List]] on 10 August 1944.&lt;ref name=hk&gt;Hackett &amp; Kingsepp&lt;/ref&gt;

''Trebizond: The Last Greek Empire of the Byzantine Era'', 1926 (Chicago: Argonaut, 1969), p. 24&lt;/ref&gt; ({{lang-el|Ιωάννης Α΄ Αξούχος}}, ''Iōannēs I Axoukhos'') was Emperor of [[Empire of Trebizond|Trebizond]] from 1235 to 1238. One editor reads the text of the chronicle of [[Michael Panaretos]] as stating that John ruled six years; although William Miller follows [[Jakob Philipp Fallmerayer|Fallmerayer]] in assuming this was a mistake for three years,&lt;ref&gt;Miller, ''Trebizond'', p. 25 and note&lt;/ref&gt; another possible solution is that John was co-ruler with his predecessor [[Andronikos I of Trebizond|Andronikos I Gidos]] for three years then ruled alone for three more.

He was the eldest son of [[Alexios I of Trebizond]] and a woman the primary sources do not identify; some writers have named her [[Theodora Axuchina]]. Miller suggests that he was perhaps a minor at the time of his father's death in 1222, for his father was succeeded by the throne passed to Alexis' son-in-law, Andronikos I Gidos.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, ''Trebizond'', p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Siege of Sinope]], one of the sources states that Alexios has "grown sons in Trebizond who are capable of governing", so it is clear John was born before 1214.&lt;ref&gt;[[Alexander Vasiliev (historian)|A. A. Vasiliev]], [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2846872 "The Foundation of the Empire of Trebizond (1204-1222)"], ''[[Speculum (journal)|Speculum]]'', '''11''' (1936), p. 27&lt;/ref&gt;

Little is recorded of John's reign, except that John died while playing [[tzykanion]], a variant of polo fashionable among the Byzantine nobility, when he fell from his horse and was trampled to death.&lt;ref&gt;[[George Finlay]] (''The History of Greece and the Empire of Trebizond, (1204-1461)'', (Edinburgh: William Blackwood, 1851), p. 338 n. 1) discusses the possible locations of the hippodrome of Trebizond where John died.&lt;/ref&gt; His heir apparent was one Ioannikios, who was confined to a monastery and John's second brother [[Manuel I of Trebizond|Manuel I]] ascended the throne. Since Fallmerayer, most historians have assume that Ioannikios was John Axouchos' son, but Panaretos' ''Chronicle'' does not state how Ioannikios was related to John Axouchos. Rustam Shukurov has argued that Ioannikios was the brother of both John and Manuel.&lt;ref&gt;Shukurov, [https://www.academia.edu/230484/Shukurov_R._The_enigma_of_David_Grand_Komnenos_Mesogeios._Vol._12._2001._P._125-136 "The enigma of David Grand Komnenos"], ''Mesogeios'', '''12''' (2001), pp. 131f (accessed 22 February 2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

Older authorities credited John Axouchos with issuing the first silver coins, or [[aspron|aspers]] of the Empire of Trebizond,&lt;ref&gt;Warwick Wroth, ''Catalogue of the Coins of the Vandals, Ostrogoths and Lombards and of the Empires of Thessalonica, Nicaea and Trebizond in the British Museum'' (London: Trustees of the British Museum, 1911), pp. lxxviii, 232-235&lt;/ref&gt; but more recent authorities believe these coins better fit with the aspers struck during [[John II of Trebizond|John II Megas Komnenos]] on numismatic grounds.&lt;ref&gt;A.A. Gordus and D.M. Metcalf, "Non-destructive Chemical Analysis of the Byzantine Silver Coinage of Trebizond", ''Archeion Pontou'', '''33''' (1975-1976), p. 29&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Keith Broomfield''' (August 3, 1979 – June 3, 2015) was an [[United States|American]] volunteer fighter who was killed while serving with the [[Kurds|Kurdish]] [[People's Protection Units|YPG]] in [[Syria]]. Broomfield is likely the first U.S. citizen to die fighting alongside Kurds during the [[Syrian Civil War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Westcott|first=Lucy|title=DETAILS EMERGE ABOUT KEITH BROOMFIELD, AMERICAN KILLED FIGHTING ISIS|url=http://www.newsweek.com/keith-broomfield-isis-american-fighting-isis-foreign-fighters-isis-syria-ypg-342215|accessdate=4 June 2017|date=11 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Keith Broomfield was born in 1979 in [[Westminster, Massachusetts]] to Tom and Donna Broomfield. He worked as the production manager for the family's manufacturing firm Broomfield Laboratories in [[Bolton, Massachusetts]]. After a motorcycle accident and rediscovering his faith, Broomfield told his father he was called to fight in Syria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=|first=|title=Father of American killed fighting Isis says God directed him to Syria|url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jun/17/father-american-killed-fighting-isis-god-directed-him-syria|accessdate=4 June 2017|date=17 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He joined the YPG on February 24, 2015 under the [[Pseudonym|nom de guerre]] Gelhat Raman.

==Kobane==
On arriving to [[Kobane]] in February, 2015, he was transferred to the military academy of Kantona Kobane. He received his month-long basic training and had a translator on hand to help him. By March, Broomfield, now Gelhat, wanted to go to the frontline near [[Sexler]], on the [[Euphrates River]] to the west of the city of Kobane. After several more weeks, with a new operation "Rubar Qamishlo" beginning, the axis of attack for the canton switched from west to south-east and east. By April, Broomfield reached the front line after joining the Kobane Sniper unit. There were a number of foreigners already there, as well as English-speaking Kurds.

Broomfield chose to stay continuously in the front line from April until his death in June 2015. Despite lacking traditional military training, he adapted himself very well. Many of his comrades spoke highly of him as a great shot and a hard-worker. His Kurdish also slowly improved as well. (http://www.latimes.com/world/middleeast/la-fg-syria-american-20150612-story.html)

However, the Kobane Sniper Unit was taking increasing casualties. Their commander, Heval Herdem (known as Musa the Sniper) was killed in early April. This was followed by the deaths of three more of the snipers, two more were wounded in explosions, another was shot through the chest, and several returned home or to Cizre Canton due to combat fatigue.

On or around June 3, 2015, Broomfield was killed by enemy sniper fire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Wyke|first=Tom|title=First US volunteer dies while fighting ISIS alongside Kurdish militia during artillery exchange in Syria|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3118770/First-volunteer-dies-fighting-ISIS-alongside-Kurdish-militia-artillery-exchange-Syria.html

== Background ==

The 2006 war was a turning point for female reporters' ability to report at the front lines alongside male reporters.&lt;ref name=telegraph /&gt;&lt;ref name=arabnews&gt;{{cite web|title=War Reporters Cross the Invisible Line for Arab Women|url=http://www.arabnews.com/node/235361|publisher=Arab News|accessdate=30 November 2012|first1=Ma'ali|last1=Ghanri|first2=Linda|last2=AyasHia}}&lt;/ref&gt; The female journalists of this generation had either lived or practiced journalism during the [[Lebanon Civil War]] (1975-1990) but news organizations did not provide them with any training.&lt;ref name=ams&gt;{{cite web|last=Abu |first=Magda |url=http://www.arabmediasociety.com/?article=22 |title=Arab Media &amp; Society |publisher=Arabmediasociety.com |date=2012-03-28 |accessdate=2012-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=newssafety /&gt; Najib's death and her job as a photojournalist was mentioned alongside the successes of other females such as Maktabi and Qassem, who were TV journalists in front of the camera.&lt;ref name=telegraph /&gt;&lt;ref name=ams /&gt;&lt;ref name=newssafety /&gt;

== Early history ==

Layal Najib was from [[Tripoli, Lebanon]].&lt;ref name=FANA /&gt;&lt;ref name=almustaqbal&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.almustaqbal.com/storiesv4.aspx?storyid=189047 |title=إقرأ في المستقبل ليال نجيب عشقت الكاميرا والصورة وأكثر من بكت الرئيس الشهيد |publisher=Almustaqbal.com |date= |accessdate=2013-12-02 |language=Arabic}}&lt;/ref&gt; She had been at ''Al Jaras'' for three years but a photographer for 1 year and 8 months.&lt;ref name=almustaqbal /&gt; Prior to working for ''Al Jaras'', Najib was a local freelance photographer.&lt;ref name=cpjnajib /&gt; She also had been a freelance photojournalist for the international news agency [[Agence France Presse]].&lt;ref name=ifex&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ifex.org/lebanon/2006/07/24/photographer_killed_in_israeli/ |title=Photographer killed in Israeli bombing |publisher=IFEX |date=July 24, 2006 |accessdate=2013-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;
For Layal Najib and other Lebanese female journalists, the 2006 war was their first opportunity to cover a combat environment.&lt;ref name=telegraph /&gt; Najib was reporting on the Israeli bombings in southern Lebanon for ''Al Jaras'' at the time of her death.

== Context ==

The 2006 Lebanon War was a 33-day conflict between Lebanon and Israel that began after Lebanese Shiite group [[Hezbollah]] conducted a cross-border raid.&lt;ref name=wp /&gt;&lt;ref name=cpjnajib /&gt;&lt;ref name=ifexcpj /&gt; The population in southern Lebanon was fleeing cities and villages to avoid bombardments. Tyre's population dwindled down to 20 percent as the majority fled.&lt;ref name=wog /&gt; During the period when Najib was killed, Israeli forces had been "indiscriminately" attacking cars, as reported by those attacked, that were driving along southern Lebanon's roads into order to flee.&lt;ref name=wp /&gt;&lt;ref name=wtd&gt;{{cite book|title=Why They Die: Civilian Devastation in Violent Conflict |first1=Daniel |last1=Rothbart |first2=Karina |last2=Korostelina |publisher=University of Michigan Press |date=2011 |accessdate=2013-10-08 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2bJ9YJg3OrYC&amp;pg=PA93&amp;lpg=PA93&amp;dq=%22Layal+Najib%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=UcrjJkEmcJ&amp;sig=61cDm0_riq7xF9XXdGbPAdUCFIo&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=CGNTUvTTDIeQhQf344DwCQ&amp;ved=0CE0Q6AEwCDgK#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Layal%20Najib%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a ''Washington Post'' report, Israelis ordered villagers from Tairi to evacuate and then later an Israeli helicopter fired a missile at a white minibus fleeing from there and killed seven out of the 19 passengers.&lt;ref name=wp /&gt; [[Human Rights Watch]] claimed ambulances that are not to be targeted during combat were also bombed. Although conservatives called the strike on the ambulances a [[2006 Israel-Lebanon conflict photographs controversies#Ambulance controversy|hoax]], HRW confirmed the attack and released a report.&lt;ref name=hrw&gt;{{cite web |title=Human Rights Watch - Google Books |publisher=Human Rights Watch |date=December 2006 |issue=1 |accessdate=2013-10-08 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oyfMo-8G4OIC&amp;pg=PA9&amp;lpg=PA9&amp;dq=%22Layal+Najib%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=U6BDqjhI52&amp;sig=nC4oXb-19lYGtyjUE59y83A3BRA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=CGNTUvTTDIeQhQf344DwCQ&amp;ved=0CEsQ6AEwBzgK#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Layal%20Najib%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Impact ==

The [[International Press Institute]] conducted interviews among members of the Lebanese media in December 2006 and concluded that they suffered "fear for their personal safety" as a consequence of violence that dates back to assassination of Prime Minister [[Rafik Hariri]] on 14 February 2005 and violence against the media that escalated afterwards and culminated in the war. The report describes a destabilized media environment.&lt;ref name=ipi&gt;{{cite book |title=Media in Lebanon: Reporting on a Nation Divided, Report on IPI’s Fact Finding Mission to Lebanon - 8-13 December 2006 |publisher=International Press Institute |year=2006 |url=http://www.freemedia.at/fileadmin/media/Documents/IPI_mission_reports/Lebanon_Mission_Report.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110919231441/http://www.freemedia.at/fileadmin/media/Documents/IPI_mission_reports/Lebanon_Mission_Report.pdf |archivedate=19 September 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Media were also targeted by the Israeli forces during the war. The [[International Federation of Journalists]] protested after the sixth attack on media. The first media worker killed during the 2006 Lebanon War Suleiman Al Chidiac on 22 July 2006 when Israeli's bombed a [[Lebanese Broadcasting Corporation]] transmission facility just north of Beirut.&lt;ref name=ifex /&gt;&lt;ref name=greenslade&gt;{{cite news|last=Greenslade |first=Roy |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/greenslade/2006/jul/27/lebanesemediaunderstrainin?INTCMP=SRCH |title=Lebanese media under strain in Israeli attacks &amp;#124; Media |publisher=The Guardian (UK) |date=2006-07-27 |accessdate=2013-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=unesco /&gt;&lt;ref name=ifj&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.b92.net/eng/news/world-article.php?yyyy=2006&amp;mm=07&amp;dd=28&amp;nav_id=35875 |title=News - IFJ, Israeli Journalists Federation don't see eye to eye |publisher=B92 |date= |accessdate=2013-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Four years after Najib, [[Assaf Abu Rahhal]] was the next Lebanese journalist killed by the [[Israel Defense Forces]] along the southern Lebanese-Israeli border.&lt;ref name=dailystarlb /&gt;&lt;ref name=fp&gt;{{cite web|author=Genevieve Belmaker |url=http://foreignpolicyblogs.com/2010/08/04/lebanese-reporter-dead-after-clashes-on-border/ |title=Lebanese Reporter Dead After Clashes on Border |publisher=Foreign Policy Blogs |date=2010-08-04 |accessdate=2013-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reactions ==

[[Koïchiro Matsuura]], director-general of [[UNESCO]], issued a statement following Al Chidiac's and Najib's death: "In times of violent conflict it is essential for all parties to respect the important role the media play in enabling the public to make informed choices and working towards peace and democracy. Belligerents can not regard media staff and media outlets as military targets. And in times of extreme hardship for the region, with hundreds of civilian deaths, the courage of journalists attempting to keep us informed of events deserves recognition."&lt;ref name=unesco&gt;{{cite web|url=http://portal.unesco.org/ci/en/ev.php-URL_ID=22610&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html |title=Director-General deplores death of two media workers in Lebanon and urges improved safety |publisher=Portal.unesco.org |date=2006-07-28 |accessdate=2013-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[International Federation of Journalists]] (IFJ) wrote a letter to the head of the Israeli Defense Force, asking for an investigation into the cases of the attacks on journalists. IFJ General Secretary Aidan White said, "It is imperative that we have answers about these incidents otherwise speculation about targeting media will persist. The Israeli authorities must make it clear to military commanders that unarmed journalists and media are non-combats. They must not come under fire." The statement drew a sharp response for the national affiliate of the IFJ in Israel when the leader of the National Federation of Israeli Journalists "suspended" the relationship and said the IFJ was biased against Israel.&lt;ref name=ifj /&gt; The international organization continued to press Israel about the six attacks, including two deaths, it had counted against media.&lt;ref name=ifexonmilitarytargets&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ifex.org/palestine/2006/07/27/ifj_presses_israel_for_answers/ |title=IFJ presses Israel for answers about recent army attacks on media personnel in the region, calls for end to "pattern of targeting" |publisher=IFEX |date=July 27, 2006 |accessdate=2013-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Reporters Without Borders]] said, "We are appalled that the Israeli army is taking so few precautions to avoid civilian deaths or casualties, especially among the media. We demand that the Israel government investigate the shooting that killed Nagib. We will not be satisfied by the army's standard response that the targets were military ones like to Hezbollah."&lt;ref name=ifex /&gt;

Joel Simon, executive director of the [[Committee to Protect Journalists]], said: "We are gravely concerned by the killings of our colleagues Layal Najib and Suleiman al-Chidiac. The aerial bombardment of Lebanon by Israel has caused tremendous hardships to civilians, including journalists who are covering the humanitarian crisis. We are alarmed by the air attacks on television transmission and telecommunication facilities. These strikes have already cost the life of one television technician and wounded another. We have seen no evidence that these media outlets are serving any military function and therefore call on Israel to cease targeting media facilities in Lebanon immediately."&lt;ref name=ifexcpj /&gt;&lt;ref name=cpjJuly2006&gt;{{cite web|author=Lebanese journalist killed, TV transmitters hit |url=http://cpj.org/2006/07/lebanese-journalist-killed-tv-transmitters-hit.php |title=Lebanese journalist killed, TV transmitters hit - Committee to Protect Journalists |publisher=Cpj.org |date=2006-07-24 |accessdate=2013-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following is a '''list of fatal [[shark attack]]s''' which have taken place '''in Australia'''. The list is organised by state. It includes: attacks where the person was killed and their body recovered; attacks that were immediately fatal or almost immediately fatal; and attacks where the victim died from wounds sustained some days after the attack. Non-fatal shark attacks are not included in this list. Fatal shark attacks amount to about one quarter of shark attacks. This list does not include missing swimmers suspected to have suffered a shark attack.

'''Mary Louise Brooks''' (November 14, 1906 – August 8, 1985) was an American film [[actress]] and [[dancer]] known professionally as '''Louise Brooks''', who was noted as an iconic symbol of the [[flapper]], and for popularizing the [[bob cut|bobbed haircut]].

Brooks is best known as the lead in three feature films made in Europe: ''[[Pandora's Box (1929 film)|Pandora's Box]]'' (1929), ''[[Diary of a Lost Girl]]'' (1929), and ''[[Miss Europe (1930 film)|Miss Europe]]'' (1930); the first two were made by [[G. W. Pabst]]. She starred in seventeen silent films and eight sound films before retiring in 1938. Brooks published her [[memoir]], ''Lulu in Hollywood'', in 1982; three years later she died of a [[Myocardial infarction|heart attack]] at the age of 78.

==Early life==
Born in [[Cherryvale, Kansas]], Louise Brooks was the daughter of Leonard Porter Brooks, a [[lawyer]], who was usually busy with his practice, and Myra Rude, an artistic mother who said that any "squalling brats she produced could take care of themselves".&lt;ref&gt;Paris (1989), p.11&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Louise-Brooks-HS.jpg|thumb|left|167px|Brooks as a sophomore in high school, 1922&lt;ref&gt;''The Wichitan'', [[Wichita High School]] yearbook, 1922.  Available at the [[Wichita Public Library]]&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Rude was a talented [[pianist]] who played the latest [[Debussy]] and [[Ravel]] for her children, inspiring them with a love of books and music.

When she was nine years old, a neighborhood man sexually abused Louise. This event had a major influence on her life and career, causing her to say in later years that she was incapable of real love, and that this man "must have had a great deal to do with forming my attitude toward sexual pleasure....For me, nice, soft, easy men were never enough – there had to be an element of domination".&lt;ref name="tynan"&gt;[[Kenneth Tynan|Tynan, Kenneth]]. [https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/debstj/tynan.html&amp;date=2009-10-25+19:25:03 ''The Girl in the Black Helmet''] in ''Show People: Profiles in Entertainment'' London:  Weidenfeld and Nicolson (1980), originally from ''[[The New Yorker]]'' (June 11, 1979)&lt;/ref&gt; When Brooks at last told her mother of the incident, many years later, her mother suggested that it must have been Louise's fault for "leading him on".&lt;ref&gt;Paris (1989) p.548&lt;/ref&gt;

Brooks began her entertainment career as a dancer, joining the [[Denishawn school|Denishawn School of Dancing and Related Arts]] modern dance company in [[Los Angeles]] in 1922. The company included founders [[Ruth St. Denis]] and [[Ted Shawn]], as well as a young [[Martha Graham]]. In her second season with the company, Brooks advanced to a starring role in one work opposite Shawn. A long-simmering personal conflict between Brooks and St. Denis boiled over one day, and St. Denis abruptly fired Brooks from the troupe in 1924, telling her in front of the other members, "I am dismissing you from the company because you want life handed to you on a silver salver".&lt;ref&gt;Paris (1980), p.53&lt;/ref&gt; The words left a strong impression on Brooks; when she drew up an outline for a planned autobiographical novel in 1949, "The Silver Salver" was the title she gave the tenth and final chapter.&lt;ref&gt;Paris (1989) p.429&lt;/ref&gt; Brooks was 15 years old at the time of her dismissal.

Thanks to her friend [[Barbara Bennett]], the sister of [[Constance Bennett|Constance]] and [[Joan Bennett|Joan]] Bennett, Brooks almost immediately found employment as a chorus girl in ''[[George White's Scandals]]'', followed by an appearance as a featured dancer in the 1925 edition of the ''[[Ziegfeld Follies]]'' on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]]. As a result of her work in the ''Follies'', she came to the attention of [[Paramount Pictures]] producer [[Walter Wanger]], who signed her to a five-year contract with the studio in 1925.&lt;ref&gt;Paris (1989) p.100&lt;/ref&gt; She was also noticed by visiting movie star [[Charlie Chaplin]], who was in town for the premiere of his film ''[[The Gold Rush]]''. The two had a two-month affair that summer.&lt;ref&gt;Paris (1989) p.109&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
[[File:Showoff.jpg|right|thumb|275px|Brooks and Gregory Kelly in ''[[The Show-Off (1926 film)|The Show-Off]]'' (1926)]]

===American films===
Brooks made her screen debut in the silent ''[[The Street of Forgotten Men]]'', in an uncredited role in 1925. Soon, however, she was playing the female lead in a number of silent light comedies and [[flapper]] films over the next few years, starring with [[Adolphe Menjou]] and [[W. C. Fields]], among others.

Brooks had an on-and-off affair with [[Walter Wanger]], head of [[Paramount Pictures]], and after her small roles in 1925, both Paramount and [[MGM]] offered her contracts. Wanger tried to encourage her to take the MGM contract, so as to avoid rumors that she only got the Paramount contract because of her association with him, but she decided to go with its offer anyhow.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Bad Girls of the Silver Screen|last=Da|first=Lottie|publisher=Carroll &amp; Graf|year=1989|isbn=9780881845129|location=New York|page=50}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She was noticed in Europe for her pivotal vamp role in the 1928 [[Howard Hawks]] silent "buddy film" ''[[A Girl in Every Port (1928 film)|A Girl in Every Port]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Paris (1989), p.214&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early sound film drama ''[[Beggars of Life]]'' (1928), Brooks played an abused country girl who kills her foster father in a moment of desperation. A hobo, Richard Arlen, happens on the murder scene and convinces Brooks to disguise herself as a young boy and escape the law by "riding the rails" with him. In a hobo encampment, or "jungle," they meet another hobo, Wallace Beery. Brooks's disguise is soon uncovered and she finds herself the only female in a world of brutal, sex-hungry men. Much of this film was shot on location, and the [[boom microphone]] was invented for this film by the director [[William Wellman]], who needed it for one of the first experimental talking scenes in the movies.

By this time in her life, she was mixing with the rich and famous, and was a regular guest of [[William Randolph Hearst]] and his mistress, [[Marion Davies]], at [[San Simeon]], being close friends with Davies' niece, [[Pepi Lederer]]. Her distinctive [[bob cut|bob haircut]] helped start a trend; many women styled their hair in imitation of her and fellow film star [[Colleen Moore]].&lt;ref&gt;Paris (1989), pp.126–28&lt;/ref&gt; Soon after ''Beggars Of Life'' was made, Brooks, who loathed the [[Hollywood]] "scene", refused to stay on at Paramount after being denied a promised raise, and left for Europe to make films for [[G. W. Pabst]], the prominent Austrian [[Expressionist]] director.

Paramount attempted to use the coming of sound films to pressure the actress, but she called the studio's bluff. It was not until 30 years later that this rebellious move would come to be seen as arguably the savviest of her career, securing her immortality as a silent film legend and independent spirit. While her initial snubbing of Paramount alone would not have finished her in Hollywood altogether, her refusal after returning from Germany to come back to Paramount for sound retakes of ''[[The Canary Murder Case (film)|The Canary Murder Case]]'' (1929) irrevocably placed her on an unofficial [[blacklist]]. [[Margaret Livingston]] was hired to dub Brooks's voice for the film,&lt;ref&gt;Paris (1989), p.311&lt;/ref&gt; as the studio claimed that Brooks's voice was unsuitable for sound pictures.

===In Europe===
Once in Germany, she starred in the 1929 film ''[[Pandora's Box (1929 film)|Pandora's Box]]'', directed by Pabst in his [[New Objectivity (film)|New Objectivity]] period. The film is based on two plays by [[Frank Wedekind]] (''[[Earth Spirit (play)|Erdgeist]]'' and ''[[Pandora's Box (play)|Die Büchse der Pandora]]'') and Brooks plays the central figure, Lulu. This film is notable for its frank treatment of modern sexual [[mores]], including one of the first screen portrayals of a [[lesbian]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite DVD notes |title=Pandora's Box |titlelink= Pandora's Box (1929 film) |origyear=1929 |author=[[G. W. Pabst|Pabst, G. W.]] |type=Commentary |publisher=[[The Criterion Collection]] |location=[[New York, New York]] |id=CC1656D |year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brooks then starred in the controversial social drama ''[[Diary of a Lost Girl]]'' (1929), based on the book by [[Margarete Böhme]] and also directed by Pabst, and ''[[Miss Europe (1930 film)|Miss Europe]]'' (1930) by [[Italy|Italian]] director [[Augusto Genina]], the latter filmed in France, and having a famous surprise ending. All these films were heavily [[censorship|censored]]{{Where|date=July 2011}}, as they were very "adult" and considered shocking for their portrayals of sexuality as well as their social satire.

==Life after film==
[[File:Louise Brooks Stars of the Photoplay.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Publicity photo, c. 1930]]

When she returned to Hollywood in 1931, she was cast in two mainstream films, ''[[God's Gift to Women]]'' (1931) and ''It Pays to Advertise'' (1931), but her performances in these films were largely ignored, and few other job offers were forthcoming due to her informal "blacklisting". {{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

Despite this, [[William Wellman]], her director on ''Beggars of Life'', offered her the female lead in his new picture, ''[[The Public Enemy]]'', starring [[James Cagney]]. Brooks turned down the role in order to visit her then-lover [[George Preston Marshall]] in New York City,&lt;ref&gt;Paris (1989), p.358&lt;/ref&gt; and the part instead went to [[Jean Harlow]], who began her own rise to stardom largely as a result. Brooks later explained to Wellman that she simply "hated [[Hollywood]]", and according to film historian [[James Card]], who came to know Brooks intimately later in her life, "she just wasn't interested&amp;nbsp;.... She was more interested in Marshall".&lt;ref name="paris359"&gt;Paris (1989), p.359&lt;/ref&gt;

In the opinion of Brooks's biographer [[Barry Paris]], "turning down ''Public Enemy'' marked the real end of Louise Brooks's film career".&lt;ref name="paris359"/&gt; She made one more film at that time, a comedy short, ''[[Windy Riley Goes Hollywood]]'' (1931), directed by Hollywood outcast [[Roscoe Arbuckle|Fatty Arbuckle]], working under the [[pseudonym]] "William Goodrich".

Brooks declared bankruptcy in 1932&lt;ref&gt;''Waterloo Daily Courrant'' (February 12, 1932)&lt;/ref&gt; and began dancing in nightclubs to earn a living. She attempted a comeback in 1936, and did a bit part in the [[Western film|Western]] ''[[Empty Saddles]]'', which led Columbia to offer her a screen test, contingent on appearing in the 1937 musical ''[[When You're in Love (film)|When You're in Love]]'', uncredited, as a specialty ballerina in the chorus. She made two more films after that, including ''[[Overland Stage Raiders]]'' (1938), a [[B movie|"B"]] Western&lt;ref&gt;[[David Shipman (writer)|Shipman, David]] ''[http://psykickgirl.com/lulu/shipman.html The Great Movie Stars: The Golden Years]''. Hamlyn 1970, {{ISBN|0-600-33817-7}}.  pp.81-83&lt;/ref&gt; in which she played the romantic lead, opposite [[John Wayne]], with a long hairstyle that rendered her all but unrecognizable from her Lulu days.

Brooks then briefly returned to [[Wichita, Kansas|Wichita]], where she was raised. "But that turned out to be another kind of hell," she said. "The citizens of Wichita either resented me having been a success or despised me for being a failure. And I wasn't exactly enchanted with them. I must confess to a lifelong curse: My own failure as a social creature."&lt;ref name="tynan"/&gt; After an unsuccessful attempt at operating a dance studio, she returned East and, after brief stints as a radio actor and a gossip columnist,&lt;ref&gt;Paris (1989), pp.408-09&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Paris (1989), p.412&lt;/ref&gt; worked as a salesgirl in a [[Saks Fifth Avenue]] store in New York City for a few years, then lived as a [[courtesan]] with a few select wealthy men as clients.&lt;ref&gt;Paris (1989), p.421&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|I found that the only well-paying career open to me, as an unsuccessful actress of thirty-six, was that of a call girl&amp;nbsp;... and (I) began to flirt with the fancies related to little bottles filled with yellow sleeping pills.&lt;ref&gt;Brooks (1982), p.38&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Brooks had been a heavy drinker since the age of 14,&lt;ref&gt;Paris (1989), p.423&lt;/ref&gt; but remained relatively sober to begin writing about film, which became her second career. During this period she began her first major writing project, an autobiographical novel called ''Naked on My Goat'', a title taken from [[Goethe]]'s ''[[Goethe's Faust|Faust]]''. After working on the novel for a number of years, she destroyed the manuscript by throwing it into an incinerator.&lt;ref&gt;Paris (1989), pp.428–30&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rediscovery===
{{Quote box| width=25%|align=right|fontsize=105%
|quote = '''"There is no Garbo! There is no Dietrich! There is only Louise Brooks!"'''
|source = [[Henri Langlois]], 1953&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/arts/article/0,8599,1559304,00.html |title=Lulu-Louise at 100 |last=Corliss |first=Richard |date=2006-11-14 |accessdate=2009-09-02 |newspaper=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
French film historians rediscovered Brooks's films in the early 1950s, proclaiming her an actress who surpassed even [[Marlene Dietrich]] and [[Greta Garbo]] as a film icon, much to her amusement. This led to the still ongoing Louise Brooks film revivals and rehabilitated her reputation in her home country.

[[James Card]], the film curator for the [[George Eastman House]], discovered Brooks living as a recluse in New York City about this time, and persuaded her to move to [[Rochester, Monroe County, New York|Rochester, New York]], to be near the George Eastman House film collection. With his help, she became a noted film writer. A collection of her writings, ''Lulu in Hollywood'', was published in 1982. She was profiled by the film writer [[Kenneth Tynan]] in his essay "The Girl in The Black Helmet", the title an allusion to her bobbed hair, worn since childhood.&lt;ref&gt;Sherrow (2006), p.65&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Van Wycks, CArolyn (April 6, 2014) [http://glamourdaze.com/2014/04/1920s-hairstyles-the-bobbed-hair-phenomenon-of-1924.html "1920s Hairstyles – The Bobbed Hair Phenomenon of 1924"] ''Glamourdaze''&lt;/ref&gt;

She rarely gave interviews, but had special relationships with film historians [[John Kobal]] and [[Kevin Brownlow]]. In the 1970s she was interviewed extensively on film for the documentaries ''[[Memories of Berlin: The Twilight of Weimar Culture]]'' (1976), produced and directed by [[Gary Conklin]], and ''[[Hollywood (1980 TV series)|Hollywood]]'' (1980), by Brownlow and [[David Gill (film historian)|David Gill]]. ''Lulu in Berlin'' (1984) is another rare filmed interview, produced by [[Richard Leacock]] and Susan Woll, released a year before her death but filmed a decade earlier. Author Tom Graves was allowed into Brooks's apartment for an interview in 1982, and later wrote about the at times awkward and tense conversation in his article "My Afternoon With Louise Brooks", the lead piece in his book ''Louise Brooks, Frank Zappa, &amp; Other Charmers &amp; Dreamers''.

==Personal life==

===Marriages and relationships===
[[File:Louise Brooks ggbain 32453u crop.jpg|thumb|187px|Brooks circa 1926]]

In the summer of 1926, Brooks married [[A. Edward Sutherland|Eddie Sutherland]], the director of the film she made with [[W. C. Fields]], but by 1927 had fallen "terribly in love"&lt;ref&gt;Leacock, Richard. [http://www.afana.org/leacockessays.htm#A%20Conversation%20with%20Louise%20Brooks ''A Conversation with Louise Brooks'']. Rochester, New York. 1973.&lt;/ref&gt; with [[George Preston Marshall]], owner of a chain of laundries and future owner of the [[Washington Redskins]] football team, following a chance meeting with him that she later referred to as "the most fateful encounter of my life".&lt;ref&gt;Paris (1989), p.199&lt;/ref&gt; She divorced Sutherland, mainly due to her budding relationship with Marshall, in June 1928.&lt;ref&gt;Paris (1989), pp.215, 246&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1933, she married Chicago [[millionaire]] [[Deering Davis]], a son of [[Nathan Smith Davis, Jr.]], but abruptly left him in March 1934 after only five months of marriage, "without a good-bye... and leaving only a note of her intentions" behind her.&lt;ref name=Paris364&gt;Paris, (1989), p.364&lt;/ref&gt; According to Card, Davis was just "another elegant, well-heeled admirer", nothing more.&lt;ref name=Paris364 /&gt; The couple officially divorced in 1938.

Despite her two marriages, she never had children, referring to herself as "Barren Brooks". Her many lovers from years before had included a young [[William S. Paley]], the founder of [[CBS]]. According to ''Louise Brooks: Looking For Lulu'', Paley provided a small monthly [[stipend]] to Brooks for the rest of her life, and according to the documentary this stipend kept her from committing [[suicide]] at one point.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

Brooks described her on-again, off-again relationship with George Preston Marshall throughout the 1920s and 1930s as abusive.&lt;ref name=looking&gt;Paris, Barry (writer); Neely, Hugh Munro (director) (1998) ''Louise Brooks: Looking for Lulu'' (documentary) [[PBS]]&lt;/ref&gt; He was the biggest reason she was able to secure a contract with Pabst.&lt;ref name=looking /&gt; Marshall repeatedly asked her to marry him, but after finding that she had had many affairs while they were together, married film actress [[Corinne Griffith]] instead.

Sometime before 1955, Brooks converted to [[Roman Catholicism]].&lt;ref&gt;Farmer, Robert (July 11, 2010)[http://sensesofcinema.com/2010/feature-articles/lulu-in-rochester-louise-brooks-and-the-cinema-screen-as-a-tabula-rasa-3/ "Lulu in Rochester: Louise Brooks and the cinema screen as a tabula rasa"] ''[[Senses of Cinema]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sexuality===
By her own admission, Brooks was a sexually liberated woman, unafraid to experiment, even posing nude for art photography,&lt;ref&gt;Paris (1989), npg&lt;/ref&gt; and her liaisons with many film people were legendary, although much of it is speculation.

Brooks enjoyed fostering speculation about her sexuality, cultivating friendships with [[lesbian]] and [[bisexual]] women including [[Pepi Lederer]] and [[Peggy Fears]], but eschewing relationships. She admitted to some lesbian dalliances, including a one-night stand with [[Greta Garbo]].&lt;ref&gt;Brooks, Louise, Roland Jaccard, and Gideon Y. Schein. ''Louise Brooks: Portrait of an Anti-star''. Phébus, 1977. {{ISBN|978-2-85940-502-1}},.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Weiss, Andrea. ''Vampires &amp; Violets: Lesbians in the Cinema''. J. Cape, 1992. {{ISBN|978-0-224-03575-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; She later described Garbo as masculine but a "charming and tender lover".&lt;ref&gt;Wayne, Jane Ellen. ''The Golden Girls of MGM''. Carroll &amp; Graf Publishers, 2003. {{ISBN|978-0-7867-1303-5}}. p.89.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McLellan, Diana. ''The Girls: Sappho Goes to Hollywood''. Macmillan, 2001. {{ISBN|978-0-312-28320-9}} p. 81.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite all this, she considered herself neither lesbian nor bisexual:

{{quote|I had a lot of fun writing 'Marion Davies' Niece' [an article about [[Pepi Lederer]]], leaving the lesbian theme in question marks. All my life it has been fun for me. ... When I am dead, I believe that film writers will fasten on the story that I am a lesbian... I have done lots to make it believable [...] All my women friends have been lesbians. But that is one point upon which I agree positively with [[Christopher Isherwood|[Christopher] Isherwood]]: There is no such thing as bisexuality. Ordinary people, although they may accommodate themselves, for reasons of whoring or marriage, are one-sexed. Out of curiosity, I had two affairs with girls – they did nothing for me.&lt;ref&gt;Paris (1989), pp.394–395&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Death==
On August 8, 1985, Brooks was found dead of a [[heart attack]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Mitgang|first=Herbert|title=Louise Brooks, Proud Star of Silent Screen, Dead at 78|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1985/08/10/movies/louise-brooks-proud-star-of-silent-screen-deat-at-78.html|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=14 November 2011|date=August 10, 1985}}&lt;/ref&gt; after suffering from [[arthritis]] and [[emphysema]] for many years. She was buried in [[Holy Sepulchre Cemetery (Rochester, New York)|Holy Sepulchre Cemetery]] in [[Rochester, New York]].

==Legacy==
As is the case with many of her contemporaries, a number of Brooks's films are considered to be lost.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} Her key films survive, however, particularly ''Pandora's Box'' and ''Diary of a Lost Girl'', which have been released on DVD in North America by the [[Criterion Collection]] and [[Kino Video]], respectively.

As of 2007, ''Miss Europe'' and ''The Show Off'' have also seen limited North American DVD release. Her short film (and one of her only talkies) ''Windy Riley Goes Hollywood'' was included on the DVD release of ''Diary of a Lost Girl''. Her final film, ''Overland Stage Raiders'', was released on VHS and in 2012 on DVD.

Louise Brooks as an unattainable film image served as an inspiration for [[Adolfo Bioy Casares]] when he wrote his [[science fiction]] novel ''[[The Invention of Morel]]'' (1940) about a man attracted to Faustine, a woman who is only a projected 3-D image.

In a 1995 interview, Casares explained that Faustine is directly based on his love for Louise Brooks who "vanished too early from the movies". (Elements of ''The Invention of Morel'', minus the science fiction elements, served as a basis for [[Alain Resnais]]'s 1961 film ''[[Last Year at Marienbad]]''.){{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

Brooks also had an influence in the graphics world – she had the distinction of inspiring two separate comics: the long-running ''[[Dixie Dugan]]'' newspaper strip by [[John H. Striebel]] that started in the late 1920s and ran until 1966, which grew out of the serialized novel and later stage musical, ''Show Girl'', that writer [[J.P. McEvoy]] had loosely based on Louise's days as a Follies girl on Broadway; and the erotic comic books of ''[[Valentina (comics)|Valentina]]'', by the late [[Guido Crepax]], which began publication in 1965 and continued for many years. Crepax became a friend and regular correspondent with Louise late in her life. [[Hugo Pratt]], another comics artist, also used her as inspiration for characters, and even named them after her.

A '''love-in''' is a peaceful public gathering focused on [[meditation]], [[love]], [[music]], [[human sexual behavior|sex]] and/or use of [[psychedelic drug]]s.  The term was coined by Los Angeles radio comedian [[Peter Bergman (comedian)|Peter Bergman]], who also hosted the first one in March or April 1967 (sources disagree) in [[Elysian Park]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://losangelesfreepress.com/the-impossible-come-back-of-radio-free-oz/]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} The impossible come-back of Radio Free Oz&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.firesigntheatre.com/albums/bergman.html] Peter Bergman biography&lt;/ref&gt;
It has been interpreted in different ways by different organizations, but is often connected to [[civil disobedience|protest]]ing local, social or [[Environmental movement|environmental]] issues.&lt;ref&gt;

Love-ins are largely considered a staple of the 1960s [[counterculture]] [[hippie]] culture.

A '''lunar outpost''' was an element of the [[George W. Bush]] era [[Vision for Space Exploration]], which has been replaced with  President [[Barack Obama]]'s [[Space policy of the Barack Obama administration|space policy]].&lt;ref name=ExpStrat&gt;{{cite web |publisher=[[NASA]] |url=http://www.nasa.gov/pdf/163896main_LAT_GES_1204.pdf |format=PDF|date=2006-12-04 |accessdate=2007-01-12 |title=Exploration Strategy and Architecture |first=Shana |last=Dale}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The outpost would have been an [[lunar base|inhabited facility on the surface of the Moon]].  At the time it was proposed, [[NASA]] was to construct the outpost over the five years between 2019 and 2024. The [[United States Congress]] directed that the U.S. portion, "shall be designated the [[Neil A. Armstrong]] Lunar Outpost".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c110:H.R.6063: |title=NASA Authorization Act of 2008 - Section 404 - Lunar Outpost |publisher=[[Library of Congress]] |date=2008-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 4, 2006, NASA announced the conclusion of its Global Exploration Strategy and [[Lunar Architecture (NASA)|Lunar Architecture]] Study.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nasa.gov/home/hqnews/2006/dec/HQ_06361_ESMD_Lunar_Architecture.html |title=NASA Unveils Global Exploration Strategy and Lunar Architecture |date=2006-12-04 |accessdate=2007-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Lunar Architecture Study's purpose was to "define a series of lunar missions constituting NASA's Lunar campaign to fulfill the Lunar Exploration elements" of the Vision for Space Exploration.&lt;ref name=ExpStrat /&gt;
What resulted was a basic plan for a lunar outpost near one of the poles of the Moon, which would permanently house astronauts in six-month shifts. These studies were made before the discovery of  [[Ice|water ice]] (5.6 ± 2.9% by mass) in a polar crater,&lt;ref name="Colaprete2010"&gt;{{Cite journal

== Reference architecture ==
A reference architecture was established for this outpost, based on a location on the rim of the [[Shackleton (crater)|Shackleton crater]], located in the immense [[South Pole-Aitken basin]], near the Moon's south pole.
At a presentation on December 4, 2006, [[Doug Cooke]] (Deputy Associate Administrator, NASA Exploration Systems Mission Directorate) described an area "that is... sunlit... 75 to 80 percent of the time, and it is adjacent to a permanently dark region in which there are potentially volatiles that we can extract and use.... This sunlit area is about the size of the [[National Mall|Washington Mall]]."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nasa.gov/pdf/164021main_lunar_architecture.pdf Microsoft Word - lunar_architecture.DOC&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; (approximately 1.25&amp;nbsp;km²). The Indian [[Exploration of the moon|Chandrayaan]] orbiter helped in the determination of the precise location of the outpost.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.space.com/aol/061226_lunar_ice.html Moonbase: In the Dark On Lunar Ice] | Space.com | 26 December 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

Other locations considered for possible lunar outposts included the rim of [[Peary (crater)|Peary crater]] near the lunar north pole and the Malapert Mountain region on the rim of [[Malapert (crater)|Malapert crater]].

The outpost design included:
* Habitation modules
* [[Solar energy|Solar power]] units
* [[Lunar rover|Unpressurized rovers]]
* [[In-Situ Resource Utilization]] (ISRU) unit
* Surface mobility carrier

The outpost would have been supplied by a mixed crew and cargo [[Altair (spacecraft)|Altair]] lander, capable of bringing four astronauts and a payload of six tons to the Moon's surface.

As planned, an incremental buildup would begin with four-person crews making several seven-day visits to the moon until their power supplies, rovers and living quarters were operational. The first mission would begin by 2020. This would be followed by 180-day missions to prepare for journeys to [[Mars]].

== History ==
The concept of establishing a [[Colonization of the Moon|long-term human presence on the Moon]] can be traced back to the late 1950s.  The [[Lunex Project]], conceptualized in 1958, was a US Air Force plan to construct an underground [[Air Force Base]] on the Moon.  On June 8, 1959, the US Army's [[Army Ballistic Missile Agency|Ballistic Missile Agency]] (ABMA) organized a task force called [[Project Horizon]] to assess the feasibility of constructing a [[military base]] on the Moon.

Project Horizon proposed using a series of [[Saturn (rocket family)|Saturn]]&lt;ref name="SaturnPlan"&gt;Please refer to [[Saturn (rocket family)#NASA involvement|Saturn (rocket family)]].&lt;/ref&gt; launches to pre-construct an outpost while in Earth orbit, with the intention of subsequently delivering and landing the completed assembly on the Moon.  Additional [[Saturn (rocket family)|Saturn]] launches each month would then ship supplies to the inhabitants.&lt;ref name="SaturnPlan" /&gt;

Work areas for lunar sample analysis, for hydroponics, and even for small animals are located in the middle areas.

A smaller sample airlock permits the crew, using remote manipulators mounted on the rover front to select, pick-up and retrieve samples without exiting the rover.

== Other countries' plans ==
Japanese Aerospace Exploration Agency ([[JAXA]]) plans a manned lunar landing around 2020 that would lead to a manned lunar base by 2030; however, there is no budget yet for this project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Staff Writers | title = Japan Plans Moon Base By 2030 | work = Moon Daily | publisher = SpaceDaily   |date= 2006-08-03 | url = http://www.moondaily.com/reports/Japan_Plans_Moon_Base_By_2030_999.html | accessdate = 2009-05-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

China National Space Administration ([[CNSA]]) has commenced the [[Chang'e program]] for exploring the Moon to investigate the prospect of lunar mining, specifically for mining [[isotope]] [[helium-3]] for use as an energy source on Earth.&lt;ref name="Luan"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://space.com/missionlaunches/china_moon_030304.html |title=China Outlines its Lunar Ambitions |first=Leonard |last=David |publisher=[[Space.com]] |date=4 March 2003 |accessdate=2009-05-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060316214426/http://space.com/missionlaunches/china_moon_030304.html |archivedate=16 March 2006 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  CNSA director [[Luan Enjie]] has stated, humans must learn to leave [[Earth]] and "set up self-sufficient extraterrestrial homeland."&lt;ref name="Luan" /&gt;  China launched the [[Chang'e 1]] robotic lunar [[orbiter]] on October 10, 2007.

The [[Russian Federal Space Agency]] (Roscosmos) has planned a fully robotic lunar base called [[Lunny Poligon]]. The project is planned for 2020, with an expected completion date of 2037.

==Justification==
In the words of former [[NASA]] Administrator, [[Michael D. Griffin]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/09/23/AR2005092301691.html| title=NASA's Griffin: 'Humans Will Colonize the Solar System'|date=September 25, 2005| publisher=[[Washington Post]]| pages=B07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|The goal isn't just scientific exploration.... It's also about extending the range of human habitat out from Earth into the solar system as we go forward in time.... In the long run a single-planet species will not survive.... If we humans want to survive for hundreds of thousands or millions of years, we must ultimately populate other planets.

Now, today the technology is such that this is barely conceivable. We're in the infancy of it.... I'm talking about that one day, I don't know when that day is, but there will be more human beings who live off the Earth than on it. We may well have people living on the moon.  We may have people living on the moons of Jupiter and other planets. We may have people making habitats on asteroids... I know that humans will colonize the solar system and one day go beyond.}}

[[NASA]] proposes six "Lunar exploration themes" to answer the question, "Why should we return to the Moon?"&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/exploration/mmb/why_moon.html Why The Moon?]". Dec. 4, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

# '''Human Civilization:''' Extend human presence to the Moon to enable [[Colonization of the Moon|eventual settlement]].
# '''Scientific Knowledge:''' Pursue scientific activities that address fundamental questions about the history of Earth, the solar system and the universe; and therefore, about our place in them.
# '''Exploration Preparation:''' Test technologies, systems, flight operations and exploration techniques to reduce the risks and increase the productivity of future missions to Mars and beyond.
# '''Global Partnerships:''' Provide a challenging, shared and peaceful activity that unites nations in pursuit of common objectives.
# '''Economic Expansion:''' Expand Earth's economic sphere, and conduct lunar activities with benefits to life on the home planet.
# '''Public Engagement:''' Use a lively space exploration program to engage the public, encourage students and help develop the high-technology workforce that will be required to address the challenges of tomorrow.

According to retired [[NASA]] Office of Inspector General Senior Special Agent Joseph Richard Gutheinz, Jr., if "NASA succeeds, we may very well see the first permanent manned presence on the moon in 2024."&lt;ref&gt;Settling the Moon: A Home Away from Home, by Joseph Richard Gutheinz, Jr.  Earth Magazine, September 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;  Gutheinz, who teaches risk management, once investigated the [[Mir|Mir Space Station]] fire and collision and frequently speaks out against unnecessary risks in space, although he considers settling the moon to be an acceptable risk.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pittsburghlive.com/x/pittsburghtrib/s_200242.html A giant leap over rough terrain]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}. The Associated Press, June 24, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
Criticisms come from groups that want the manned exploration money diverted to Mars, from those who prefer unmanned exploration, and from those who simply want the money spent elsewhere. The criticisms listed here mostly predate the discovery of significant amounts of polar water ice. [[Jeff Foust]], writing for ''The Space Review'', called the six themes that NASA released too "broad" and the explanations supporting them "shallow."  He also argues that a Moon base is a poor use of resources, since "science can be done for far less money by [[Human versus robotic spaceflight|robotic missions]]—which also don't put human lives at risk."&lt;ref&gt;Jeff Foust. "[http://www.thespacereview.com/article/764/1 Moonbase Why]". ''The Space Review''. Dec. 11, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;  The ''Los Angeles Times'' seconded that in an editorial, saying "Manned moon flight may appeal to [[baby boomer]]s, but it makes little scientific sense for most space missions these days. Robots can now perform, or be developed to perform, most of the tasks people would do at a moon station." &lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/la-ed-moon10dec10,0,2327043.story?coll=la-opinion-leftrail Don't colonize the moon]". ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''. Dec. 10, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

Columnist [[Gregg Easterbrook]], who has reported on the space program for decades, has criticized the plans as a poor use of resources.  He writes that

&lt;blockquote&gt;Although, of course, the base could yield a great discovery, its scientific value is likely to be small while its price is extremely high. Worse, moon-base nonsense may for decades divert NASA resources from the agency's legitimate missions, draining funding from real needs in order to construct human history's silliest [[white elephant]].&lt;ref&gt;Gregg Easterbrook. "[http://www.slate.com/id/2155164 Moon Baseless: NASA can't explain why we need a lunar colony]". ''Slate''. Dec. 8, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to Easterbrook, the billions of dollars that a lunar colony might cost should instead be devoted to exploring the solar system with [[space probe]]s; [[Space observatory|space observatories]]; and protecting the Earth from [[near-Earth asteroid]]s.

[[Buzz Aldrin]], the second of twelve men to have walked on the Moon, disagrees with NASA's current goals and priorities, including their plans for a lunar outpost.  While not necessarily opposed to sending people back to the Moon, Aldrin argues that NASA should concentrate on a [[Manned mission to Mars|crewed mission to Mars]] and leave further lunar exploration and the establishment of a base there to a consortium of other countries under U.S. leadership.&lt;ref name=aldrin&gt;[[Buzz Aldrin]] and David Noland. "[http://www.popularmechanics.com/science/air_space/4322647.html?page=1 Buzz Aldrin to NASA: U.S. Space Policy Is on the Wrong Track] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090714155041/http://www.popularmechanics.com/science/air_space/4322647.html?page=1 |date=2009-07-14 }}." ''[[Popular Mechanics]]'' August 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;  In a July 2009 editorial in the ''Washington Post'', he said that NASA's [[Vision for Space Exploration]] "is not visionary; nor will it ultimately be successful in restoring American space leadership. Like its Apollo predecessor, this plan will prove to be a dead end littered with broken spacecraft, broken dreams and broken policies."  He continued by saying that

&lt;blockquote&gt;the lunar surface... is a poor location for homesteading. The moon is a lifeless, barren world, its stark desolation matched by its hostility to all living things. And replaying the glory days of Apollo will not advance the cause of American space leadership or inspire the support and enthusiasm of the public and the next generation of space explorers.&lt;ref name=aldrin2&gt;[[Buzz Aldrin]]. "[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/07/15/AR2009071502940.html Time to Boldly Go Once More]. ''Washington Post''. July 16, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== 2008 concepts study ==
On June 6, 2008 NASA announced a set of six research opportunities and requested proposals for research funding in response to the announcement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://procurement.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/eps/sol.cgi?acqid=130133 |title=Exploration Systems Mission Directorate - Lunar Surface Systems Concepts Study |publisher=NASA |date=2008-06-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080917120619/http://procurement.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/eps/sol.cgi?acqid=130133 |archivedate=2008-09-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The overall budget for research conducted as part of this "Lunar Surface Systems Concepts Study" is anticipated to be $2 million. Proposals will be selected and contracts awarded in August 2008 by the NASA Constellation [[Lunar Surface Systems Project Office]] (LSSPO).

== 2010/2011 surface system concept review ==
The LSSPO was established at the [[Johnson Space Center]] in August 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nasa.gov/pdf/240373main_06-06-08-LSS%20BAA%20Compilation%20of%20briefings%20teammb.pdf |format=PDF|title=Lunar Surface Systems Concepts Study - Compilation of Briefings |publisher=NASA ESMD}}&lt;/ref&gt; The LSSPO was studying lunar surface systems such as "habitation systems", [[ISRU]], [[rover (space exploration)|rovers]], power production and storage, systems to meet science and exploration objectives and safety systems. The LSSPO was expected to conduct a surface system concept review in the 2010 or 2011 timeframe.

{{About|the carnal desire}}

[[File:Jheronimus Bosch Table of the Mortal Sins (Luxuria).jpg|thumb|right|280px|Detail: ''Luxuria'' (Lust), in ''[[The Seven Deadly Sins and the Four Last Things]]'', by [[Hieronymus Bosch]]]]
{{emotion}}
'''Lust''' is a psychological force producing intense wanting for an object, or circumstance fulfilling the emotion.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Lazarus with Bernice N Lazarus, ''Passion and Reason: Making Sense of Our Emotions'', 1994, New York: Oxford University Press {{ISBN|978-0-19-510461-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Lust can take any form such as the lust for sexuality, money or power. It can take such mundane forms as the lust for food as distinct from the need for food.

==In religion==

Religions, especially Christianity, tend to draw a distinction between passion and lust by further categorizing lust as an inappropriate desire or a desire that is inappropriately strong, and therefore morally wrong, whereas passion (for proper purposes)  is maintained to be something God-given and moral.

===Buddhism===
{{Main article|tanha}}

Lust holds a critical position in the philosophical underpinnings of Buddhist reality.  It is named in the second of the [[Four Noble Truths]], which are that 
# Suffering ([[dukkha]]) is inherent in all life.
# Suffering is caused by ''lust''.
# There is a natural way to eliminate all suffering from one's life.
# The [[Noble Eightfold Path]] is that way.

Lust is the, attachment to, identification with, and passionate desire for certain things in existence, all of which relate to the [[Five skandhas#The five skandhas|form, sensation, perception, mentality, and consciousness]] that certain combinations of these things engender within us. Lust is thus the ultimate cause of general imperfection and the most immediate ''root'' cause of a certain suffering.

The passionate desire for either non-existence or for freedom from lust is a common misunderstanding. For example, the headlong pursuit of lust (or other "[[Seven deadly sins|deadly sin]]") in order to fulfill a [[death instinct|desire for death]] is followed by a reincarnation accompanied by a self-fulfilling [[karma]], resulting in an endless [[wheel of life]], until the right way to live, the right worldview, is somehow discovered and practiced. Beholding an [[endless knot]] puts one, symbolically, in the position of the one with the right worldview, representing that person who attains freedom from lust.

In existence are four kinds of things that engender the clinging: rituals, worldviews, pleasures, and the self.  The way to eliminate lust is to learn of its unintended effects and to pursue righteousness as concerns a worldview, intention, speech, behavior, livelihood, effort, mindfulness, and concentration, in the place where lust formerly sat.
[[File:Sankt_Bartholomäus_(Reichenthal)_04.jpg|left|thumb|156x156px|Detail of ''Lust'' at the [[Bartholomew the Apostle|Sankt Bartholomäus]] church ([[Reichenthal]]), [[Pulpit]] (1894)]]

===Christianity===
==== New Testament ====
In many translations of the [[New Testament]], the word "lust" translates the Greek word ἐπιθυμέω, particularly in [[Matthew 5:27-28]]:
{{"|Ye have heard that it was said by them of old time, Thou shalt not commit adultery: But I say unto you, That whosoever looketh on a woman to lust (ἐπιθυμέω) after her hath committed adultery with her already in his heart.}}

In English-speaking countries, the term "lust" is often associated with [[sexual desire]], probably because of this verse. But just as the English word was originally a general term for ''desire'', the Greek word ἐπιθυμέω was also a general term for desire. The [[LSJ]] lexicon suggests "set one's heart upon a thing, long for, covet, desire" as glosses for ἐπιθυμέω, which is used in verses that clearly have nothing to do with sexual desire. In the [[Septuagint]], ἐπιθυμέω is the word used in the commandment to not covet:

{{"|You shall not covet your neighbor's wife; you shall not covet your neighbor's house or his field or his male slave or his female slave or his ox or his draft animal or any animal of his or whatever belongs to your neighbor.|Exodus 20:17, New English Translation of the Septuagint}}

While coveting your neighbor's wife may involve sexual desire, it's unlikely that coveting a neighbor's house or field is sexual in nature. And in most New Testament uses, the same Greek word, ἐπιθυμέω, does not have a clear sexual connotation. For example, from the [[American Standard Version]] the same word is used outside of any sexual connotation:

# [[Wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Matthew#13:17|Matthew 13:17]]: For verily I say unto you, that many prophets and righteous men ''desired'' to see the things which ye see, and saw them not; and to hear the things which ye hear, and heard them not.
# [[Wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Luke#22:15|Luke 22:15-16]]: And he said unto them, With ''desire'' I have desired to eat this passover with you before I suffer: for I say unto you, I shall not eat it, until it be fulfilled in the kingdom of God.
# [[Wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Acts#20:33|Acts 20:33]]: I ''coveted'' no man's silver, or gold, or apparel. Ye yourselves know that these hands ministered unto my necessities, and to them that were with me.
# [[Wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Luke#15:14|Luke 15:14-16]]: And when [the [[prodigal son]]] had spent all, there arose a mighty famine in that country; and he began to be in want. And he went and joined himself to one of the citizens of that country; and he sent him into his fields to feed swine. And he ''would fain'' have filled his belly with the husks that the swine did eat: and no man gave unto him.

====Catholicism====
[[File:Daemon.jpg|left|thumb|A demon [[masturbation|satiating his lust]] in a 13th-century manuscript]]
[[File:La Luxure dans l'art roman.JPG|thumb|[[Romanesque art|Romanesque]] [[Capital (architecture)|capital]] representing lust]]

According to the [[Catholic Encyclopedia]], a Christian's heart is lustful when "venereal satisfaction is sought for either outside wedlock or, at any rate, in a manner which is contrary to the laws that govern marital intercourse".&lt;ref&gt;{{CathEncy|wstitle=Lust}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pope John Paul II]] said that lust devalues the eternal attraction of male and female, reducing personal riches of the opposite sex to an object for gratification of sexuality.&lt;ref name="PopeJohn"&gt;Pope John Paul II, ''Mutual Attraction Differs from Lust''.L'Osservatore Romano, Weekly Edition in English, 22 September 1980, p. 11. Available at http://www.ewtn.com/library/papaldoc/jp2tb39.htm .&lt;/ref&gt;

Lust is considered by [[Catholicism]] to be a disordered desire for [[sexual pleasure]], where sexual pleasure is "sought for itself, isolated from its procreative and unitive purposes".&lt;ref&gt;'Catechism of the Catholic Church, n° 2351 sq.&lt;/ref&gt; In Catholicism, sexual desire in itself is good, and is considered part of God's plan for humanity. However, when sexual desire is separated from God's love, it becomes disordered and self-seeking. This is seen as lust.

The Latin for ''extravagance'' (Latin: ''luxuria'') was used by St [[Jerome]] to translate a variety of biblical sins, including drunkenness and sexual excess.&lt;ref&gt;Mark D. Jordan, ''The Invention of Sodomy'' (1994) p. 37&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gregory the Great]] placed ''luxuria'' as one of the seven capital sins (it is often considered the least serious of the seven deadly sins), narrowing its scope to disordered desire,&lt;ref&gt;Mark D. Jordan, ''The Invention of Sodomy'' (1994) p. 39-40; [https://www.academia.edu/8268216/_Luxure_cléricale_gouvernement_de_l_Église_et_royauté_capétienne_au_temps_de_la_Bible_de_saint_Louis_Revue_Mabillon_25_2014_p._165-194 Julien Théry, "Luxure cléricale, gouvernement de l’Église et royauté capétienne au temps de la 'Bible de saint Louis'", ''Revue Mabillon'', 25, 2014, p. 165-194]&lt;/ref&gt; and it was in this sense that the Middle Ages generally took ''luxuria'', (although the [[Old French]] [[cognate]] was [[loan word|adopted]] into English as ''luxury'' without its sexual meaning by the 14th century{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}).

In [[Romanesque art]], the [[Anthropomorphism|personified]] Luxuria is generally feminine,&lt;ref&gt;J. Jerman/A. Weir, ''Images of Lust'' (2013) p. 30&lt;/ref&gt; often represented by a [[siren (mythology)|siren]] or a naked woman with breasts being bitten by snakes. [[Prudentius]] in his [[Psychomachia]] or Battle of the Soul had described&lt;ref&gt;Helen Waddell, ''The Wandering Scholars'' (1968) p. 48&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; Luxury, lavish of her ruined fame, Loose-haired, wild-eyed, her voice a dying fall, Lost in delight....&lt;/blockquote&gt; For [[Dante]], Luxuria was both the first of the circles of incontinence (or self-indulgence) on the descent into hell, and the last of the cornices of Mount Purgatory, representing the excessive (disordered) love of individuals;&lt;ref&gt;Dante, ''Hell' (1975) p. 101; Dante, ''Purgatory'' (1971) p. 67 and p. 202&lt;/ref&gt; while for [[Edmund Spenser|Spenser]] luxuria was synonymous with the power of desire.&lt;ref&gt;C. J. Berry, ''The Idea of Luxury'' (1994) p. 97-8&lt;/ref&gt;

The daughters (by-products) of Luxuria, for Gregory and subsequent [[Thomism]], included mental blindness, self-love, haste and excessive attachment to the present:&lt;ref&gt;Mark D. Jordan, ''The Invention of Sodomy'' (1994) p. 37-9&lt;/ref&gt; [[Marianne Dashwood]] has been seen as embodying such characteristics for a later age – as a daughter of Luxuria.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Liddell, ''The Novels of Jane Austen'' (London 1963) p. 22&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hinduism===

In the [[Bhagavad Gita]], Lord [[Krishna]], an [[Avatar]] of [[Vishnu]], declared in verse 21 that lust is one of the gates to [[Naraka (Hinduism)|Naraka]] or hell.

{{Quote|[[Arjuna]] said: O descendant of Vrsni, by what is one impelled to [[sin]]ful acts, even unwillingly, as if engaged by force? Then Krishna said: It is lust only, Arjuna, which is born of contact with the material mode of passion and later transformed into [[wrath]], and which is the all-devouring sinful enemy of this world. As fire is covered by smoke, as a mirror is covered by dust, or as the embryo is covered by the womb, the living entity is similarly covered by different degrees of this lust. Thus the wise living entity's pure [[consciousness]] becomes covered by his eternal enemy in the form of lust, which is never satisfied and which burns like fire. The [[senses]], the [[mind]] and the [[intelligence]] are the sitting places of this lust. Through them lust covers the real knowledge of the living entity and bewilders him. Therefore, O Arjuna, best of the Bharatas, in the very beginning curb this great symbol of [[sin]]—(lust) by regulating the senses, and slay this destroyer of [[knowledge]] and [[self-realization]]. The working [[senses]] are superior to dull [[matter]]; [[mind]] is higher than the [[senses]]; [[intelligence]] is still higher than the [[mind]]; and he [the soul] is even higher than the [[intelligence]]. Thus knowing oneself to be [[Transcendence (religion)|transcendental]] to the material senses, mind and intelligence, O mighty-armed Arjuna, one should steady the mind by deliberate [[Spirituality|spiritual]] intelligence and thus—by spiritual strength—conquer this insatiable enemy known as lust. ([[Bhagavad-Gita]], 3.36–43)}}

In this ancient manuscript the idea behind the word 'Lust' is best comprehended as the psychological force called 'Wanting'.

====Brahma Kumaris====
According to [[Brahma Kumaris]], a spiritual organization which is based on [[Hindu philosophy]], sexual lust is the greatest enemy to all mankind&lt;ref&gt;''Through open doors: a view of Asian cultures in Kenya''. Cynthia Salvadori, Andrew Fedders, 1989&lt;/ref&gt; and the gateway to hell.&lt;ref&gt;''Exploring New Religions''. p. 196, George D. Chryssides, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

For this reason followers do not eat onions, garlic, eggs, or non-vegetarian food, as the "sulphur" in them can excite sexual lust in the body, otherwise bound to celibacy.

The physical act of sex is "impure", leading to body-consciousness and other crimes. This impurity "poisons" the body and leads to many kinds of "diseases".

The Brahma Kumaris teach that sexuality is like foraging about in a dark sewer. Students at Spiritual University must conquer lust in order to find the [[Golden Age]], a heaven on earth, where children are conceived by an asexual power of mind, and lasting for 2,500 years in the peace and purity of a holy swan moving on earth, over water, and in air.&lt;ref&gt;Peace &amp; purity: the story of the Brahma Kumaris : a spiritual revolution By [[Liz Hodgkinson]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''A history of celibacy'', p. 172. Elizabeth Abbott, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

===Islam===
In [[Islam]], intentional lascivious glances are forbidden. Lascivious thoughts are disliked, for they are the first step towards adultery, rape and other antisocial behaviors. [[Prophet]] [[Muhammad]] also stressed the magnitude of the "second glance", as the first glance towards an attractive member of the opposite sex could be just accidental or observatory, the second glance could be that gate into lustful thinking.&lt;ref&gt; [[Jami` at-Tirmidhi]],2701 "The Messenger of Allaah (Peace &amp; Blessings of Allaah be upon Him) said: "O Ali, do not follow a glance with another, for you will be forgiven for the first, but not for the second.".&lt;/ref&gt; Islam does not advocate [[celibacy]] but it requires marriage to conduct sex legally.

===Judaism===

{{main article|Yetzer hara#The evil inclination in Jewish tradition}}
In [[Judaism]], all evil inclinations and lusts of the flesh are characterized by ''[[Yetzer hara]]'' (Hebrew, יצר הרע, the evil inclination). Yetzer hara is not a demonic force; rather, it is man's misuse of the things which the physical body needs to survive, and is often contrasted with ''yetzer hatov'' (Hebrew, יצר הטוב, the positive desire).

''Yetzer HaRa'' is often identified with [[Satan]] and the angel of death,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Bava Bathra|pages=16a}}&lt;/ref&gt; and there is sometimes a tendency to give a personality and separate activity to the ''yetzer''. For the ''yetzer'', like Satan, misleads man in this world, and testifies against him in the world to come. The ''yetzer'' is, however, clearly distinguished from Satan, and on other occasions is made exactly parallel to sin. The [[Torah]] is considered the great antidote against this force. Though, like all things which God has made, the ''yetzer hara'' (evil inclination) can be manipulated into doing good: for without it, man would never marry, beget a child, build a house, or occupy himself in a trade.

===Paganism===

Few ancient, [[Paganism|pagan religions]] actually considered lust to be a vice.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} The most famous example of a widespread religious movement practicing lechery as a ritual is the [[Bacchanalia]] of the [[Ancient Roman]] [[Bacchantes]]. However, this activity was soon outlawed by the [[Roman Senate]] in 186 BC in the decree ''[[Senatus consultum de Bacchanalibus]]''. The practice of sacred prostitution, however, continued to be an activity practiced often by the [[Dionysian]]s.

===Sikhism===

In [[Sikhism]], lust is counted among the five cardinal sins or sinful propensities, the others being [[Wrath]], ego, [[greed (deadly sin)|greed]] and [[Attachment theory|attachment]]. Uncontrollable expression of sexual lust, as in rape or [[sexual addiction]], is an evil.

===Meher Baba's teachings===

The spiritual teacher [[Meher Baba]] described the differences between lust and love:
 
&lt;blockquote&gt;In lust there is reliance upon the object of sense and consequent spiritual subordination of the soul to it, but love puts the soul into direct and co-ordinate relation with the reality which is behind the form. Therefore lust is experienced as being heavy and love is experienced as being light. In lust there is a narrowing down of life and in love there is an expansion in being...If you love the whole world you vicariously live in the whole world, but in lust there is an ebbing down of life and a general sense of hopeless dependence upon a form which is regarded as another. Thus, in lust there is the accentuation of separateness and suffering, but in love there is the feeling of unity and joy....&lt;ref&gt;[[Meher Baba|Baba, Meher]] (1967). [http://www.discoursesbymeherbaba.org/ ''Discourses'']. Volume I. San Francisco: Sufism Reoriented. pp. 159–160. {{ISBN|978-1880619094}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==In culture==

===Medieval prostitutes===

Medieval prostitutes lived officially sanctioned in "red light districts." In Ruth Mazo Karras' book ''Common Women'', she discusses the meaning of prostitution and how people thought the proper use of prostitutes by unmarried men helped contain male lust. Prostitution was thought of as having a beneficial effect by reducing the [[sexual frustration]] in the community.&lt;ref&gt;Karras, Ruth Mazo. Common Women: Prostitution and Sexuality in Medieval England. New York: Oxford UP, 1996. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

== In art ==

[[File:Mujeres riendo.jpg|right|thumb|[[Goya]]'s [[Man Mocked by Two Women]] (''Dos Mujeres y un hombre''), c. 1820]]

=== Literature ===

From [[Ovid]] to the works of ''[[poète maudit|les poètes maudits]]'', characters have always been faced with scenes of lechery, and long since has lust been a common motif in world literature. Many writers, such as [[Georges Bataille]], [[Casanova]] and [[Prosper Mérimée]], have written works wherein scenes at bordellos and other unseemly locales take place.

[[Baudelaire]], author of ''[[Les fleurs du mal]]'', had once remarked, in regard to the artist, that:

{{cquote|The more a man cultivates the arts, the less randy he becomes... Only the brute is good at coupling, and copulation is the lyricism of the masses. To copulate is to enter into another—and the artist never emerges from himself.}}

The most notable work to touch upon the sin of lust, and all of the Seven Deadly Sins, is Dante's ''[[la Divina Commedia]]''. Dante's criterion for lust was an "excessive love of others," insofar as an excessive love for man would render one's love of God secondary.

In the first canticle of [[Dante]]'s ''[[Divine Comedy#Inferno|Inferno]]'', the lustful are punished by being continuously swept around in a whirlwind, which symbolizes their passions. The damned who are guilty of lust, like the two famous lovers, Paolo and Francesca, receive what they desired in their mortal lives, their passions never give them rest for all eternity. In ''[[Purgatorio]]'', of the selfsame work, the penitents choose to walk through flames in order to purge themselves of their lustful inclinations.

==In philosophy==

The link between [[love]] and lust has always been a problematic question in philosophy.

===Schopenhauer===

[[Schopenhauer]] notes the misery which results from [[sexual relationship]]s. According to him, this directly explains the sentiments of shame and sadness which tend to follow the act of sexual intercourse. For, he states, the only power that reigns is the inextinguishable desire to face, at any price, the blind love present in human existence without any consideration of the outcome. He estimates that a genius of his species is an industrial being who wants only to produce, and wants only to think. The theme of lust for Schopenhauer is thus to consider the horrors which will almost certainly follow the culmination of lust.

===St. Thomas Aquinas===

[[St. Thomas Aquinas]] defines the sin of Lust in questions 153 and 154 of his Summa Theologica. Aquinas says the sin of lust is of "voluptuous emotions," and makes the point that sexual pleasures, "unloosen the human spirit," and set aside right reason (Pg.191). Aquinas restricts lust's subject matter to physical desires specifically arising from sexual acts, but Aquinas does not assume all sex-acts are sinful. Sex is not a sin in marriage, because sex is the only way for humans to reproduce. If sex is used naturally and the end purpose is reproduction there is no sin. Aquinas says, "if the end be good and if what is done is well-adapted to that, then no sin is present," (Pg.193). However, sex simply for the sake of pleasure is lustful and therefore, a sin. A man who uses his body for lechery wrongs the Lord.

Sex may have the attributes of being sinless; however, when a person seeks sex for pleasure, he or she is sinning with lust. Lust is best defined by its specific attribute of rape, adultery, wet dreams, seduction, unnatural vice, and simple fornication.

[[Wet dreams]]: St. Thomas Aquinas defined and discussed the topic of nocturnal emission, which occurs when one dreams of physical pleasure. Aquinas argues those who say that wet dreams are a sin and comparable to the actual experience of sex are wrong. Aquinas believes that such an action is sinless, for a dream is not under a person's control or free judgment. When one has a "nocturnal orgasm," it is not a sin, but it can lead to sins (Pg. 227). Aquinas says that wet dreams come from a physical cause of inappropriate pictures within your imagination, a psychological cause when thinking of sex while you fall asleep and a demonical cause where by demons act upon the sleepers body, "stirring the sleeper's imagination to bring about a orgasm," (Pg. 225).  In the end, though, dreaming of lustful acts is not sinful. The "mind's awareness is less hindered," as the sleeper lacks right reason; therefore, a person cannot be accountable for what they dream while sleeping, (Pg. 227).

[[Adultery]]: One of the main forms of lust seen frequently during the Middle Ages was the sin of adultery. The sin of adultery occurs when a person is unfaithful to his or her spouse, hence "invading of a bed not one's own," (Pg.235). Adultery is a special kind of ugliness and many difficulties arise from it. When a man enters the bed of a married woman it not only is a sin, but it "wrongs the offspring," because the woman now calls into question the legitimacy of children. (Pg.235). If a wife has committed adultery before, then, her husband will question if all his wife's children are his offspring. 
	
[[Fornication|Simple fornication]]: Simple fornication is having sex with one's wife for enjoyment rather than for bearing children. Fornication is also sex between two unmarried people, which is also a mortal sin. Aquinas says, "fornication is a deadly crime," (Pg.213). Fornication is a mortal sin, but as Aquinas notes, "Pope Gregory treated sins of the flesh as less grievous than those of the spirit" (Pg. 217). Fornication was a grave sin such as that against property. Fornication, however, is not as grave as a sin directly against God and human life; therefore, murder is much worse than fornication. Property in this case means that a daughter is the property of her father, and if you do wrong to her, you then do wrong to him; therefore seducing a virgin or seeking pleasure from an unmarried woman is an invasion of a father's property.

[[Rape]]: Rape is a kind of lust that often coincides with seduction and is defined as a type of lechery. Rape comes with force and violence: Rape occurs when a person craves the pleasures of sex so intensely that he uses force to obtain it. Rape is committed when violence is used to seduce, or deflower a virgin. Rape harms both the unmarried girl and her father, because the girl is property of her father. Rape and seduction can be discussed together, because both sins involve the deflowering of a virgin; however, rape can happen without seduction, as when a man attacks a widow or a sexually experienced woman and violates her. Therefore, wherever violence accompanies sex, you have the quality of rape and the sin of lust.

[[Seduction]]: Seduction is a type of lust, because seduction is a sex act, which ravishes a virgin. Lust is a sin of sexual activity, and, "…a special quality of wrong that appears if a maid still under her father's care is debauched" (Pg.229). Seduction involves a discussion of property, as an unmarried girl is property of her father. A virgin, even though free from the bond of marriage, is not free from the bond of her family. When a virgin is violated without a promise of engagement, she is prevented from having honorable marriage, which is shameful to herself and her family. A man who performs sexual acts with a virgin must "endow her and have her to wife," and if the father, who is responsible for her, says no, then a man must pay a dowry to compensate for her loss of virginity and future chance of marriage. (Pg.229)

'''Unnatural vice:''' Unnatural vice is the worst kind of lust because it is unnatural in act and purpose. Unnatural vice happens variously, but Aquinas provides several examples including [[bestiality]] or intercourse with a "thing of another species," for example animals. Aquinas said, "bestiality goes beyond the bands of humanity" and is therefore, unnatural.

==Contemporary spiritual perspective==

[[Barry Long]] states that lusting is simply thinking or fantasising about an [[sexual fantasy|imagined sexual scene]] and private parts of the body. The action of thinking or fantasising stirs the natural, pure sexual energy into a coarser, more degraded emotional form (lust).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.barrylong.org/statements/manschallenge.shtml |title=Barry Long Foundation International |publisher=Barrylong.org |date= |accessdate=2011-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;'MAKING LOVE Sexual Love the Divine Way' Barry Long, Book {{ISBN|978-1-899324-14-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Barry Long, Gold Coast Talks audio, February 1997&lt;/ref&gt; Long encourages lovemaking as the practice of converting sexual energy into the knowledge of love: "You don’t need a celibate body, you need a celibate mind".&lt;ref&gt;Gold Coast Talks audio April 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

==In psychoanalysis and psychology==

{{Main article|libido}}
Lust, in the domain of [[psychoanalysis]] and [[psychology]], is often treated as a case of "heightened [[libido]]".

A person is more likely to lust after someone who does not resemble themself. Self-relatedness is a cue of kinship and causes an instinctual reaction to not be attracted. Therefore, self-resemblance decreases attractiveness and sexual desire in a person, while less resemblance increases attractiveness and sexual desire, creating a higher possibility of lust.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1098/rspb.2004.3003| title = Trustworthy but not lust-worthy: Context-specific effects of facial resemblance| journal = Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences| volume = 272| issue = 1566| pages = 919–22| year = 2005| last1 = Debruine | first1 = L.

On April 5, 2003, Beyer challenged Canadian WBC super middleweight champion [[Eric Lucas]] and was awarded a highly controversial split decision in Germany.[https://web.archive.org/web/20090728021945/http://www.eastsideboxing.com/boxing-news/EricLucas-MarkusBeyer.php] It was later proven that Beyer's team cheated by obtaining the judges' scores during the fight.[http://ici.radio-canada.ca/sports/special/podium-boxe-eric-lucas-markus-beyer-allemagne-2003/] Beyer defended the title against [[Danny Green (boxer)|Danny Green]] and Andre Thysse before being upset by [[Cristian Sanavia]]. Beyer defeated Sanavia by knockout in a rematch then went on to retain the title five times by scoring wins over Yoshinori Nishizawa, Danny Green, [[Omar Sheika]], [[Alberto Colajanni]], and a draw against [[Sakio Bika]].

On October 14, 2006, Beyer lost his title via third-round knockout to [[World Boxing Association|WBA]] super middleweight champion [[Mikkel Kessler]] in a unification fight.

'''Nikola Kalabić''' ({{lang-sr|Никола Калабић}}; 20 December 1906 – 20 January 1946) was a [[Serbs|Serbian]] [[Chetnik]] commander during [[World War II]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.novosti.rs/vesti/naslovna/aktuelno.69.html:315927-Kalabic-i-zvanicno-mrtav Kalabić officially dead], ''[[Večernje novosti]]'', 20 January 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
He was born to father [[Milan Kalabić|Milan]] and mother Joka in [[Podnovlje]] (municipality of [[Doboj]]) in present-day [[Republika Srpska]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]]. He had a sister named Angelina (1912–1999).

Nikola's father separated from Joka after [[World War I]] and proceeded to get married three times. Nikola lived with his father at first so he attended school in places where his father served with the Serbian army. He eventually finished six grades of [[Gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]] before becoming a student of [[geodesy]] in [[Belgrade]]. During his studies, he met Borka (a year younger than him) who was born in Rajkovići near [[Valjevo]] in present-day [[Serbia]] into a family of old supporters of the [[People's Radical Party]] and [[Nikola Pašić]]. Borka and Nikola married in 1929 and on 3 August 1930 they had twins Mirjana and Milan. Their first service was in Belgrade. They then moved to [[Aranđelovac]] and finally back to Valjevo (where there are Kalabićs today). Nikola Kalabić (until the start of [[World War II]]) worked in Land-registry management in Valjevo.

==World War II==
During World War II, Nikola Kalabić was commander of [[Draža Mihailović|Draža Mihailović's]] elite formation named Mountain Guard Corps ({{lang-sr-cyr|Корпус горске гарде}}).{{citation needed|date=April 2014}} On 26 November 1943, together with the General Inspector of Chetnik Troops Colonel Simić, he concluded a formal collaboration agreement ({{lang-de|Waffenruhe-Verträge}}) with the representative of the German Military Commander in Southeast Europe, ''[[General of the Infantry (Germany)|General der Infanterie]]'' (Lieutenant General) [[Hans Felber]].{{sfn|Tomasevich|1975|pp=323}}

===Capture and alleged collaboration with the OZNA===
Near the very end of the war, Kalabić and many other Chetniks tried to hide in rural areas of the country, awaiting an attempt to overthrow the new government. The [[OZNA]] had a plan to capture former members of the Chetnik movement and other military organizations outside of Yugoslavia. There, OZNA agents infiltrated the support network of Kalabić and arrested him in a covert operation on 5 December 1945.

After a few days, Kalabić agreed to collaborate with the OZNA in their efforts of locating and arresting [[Draža Mihailović]], in return for immunity from prosecution. This claim however has been brought into question by family members of Kalabić claiming that he did not surrender Mihailović. Kalabić was then executed by [[Yugoslav Partisans]] although this claim has also been questioned.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.blic.rs/Vesti/Srbija/230819/Nikola-Kalabic-ubijen-pre-hvatanja-Draze Nikola Kalabić killed before the capture of Draža], ''[[Blic|Blic online]]'', 22 January 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Kalabić was officially rehabilitated by a Serbian court in May 2017.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.novosti.rs/vesti/naslovna/drustvo/aktuelno.290.html:667262-Rehabilitovan-Nikola-Kalabic Rehabilitovan Nikola Kalabić], novosti.rs; accessed 17 April 2018.{{sr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''prayer circles''' is most simply where participants join hands in a literal circle of [[prayer]], often as part of a [[vigil]]. Informal prayer circles have been practiced for centuries. Their recent resurgence in popularity is frequently attributed to their use in the [[Catholic Charismatic Renewal]] movement. Similarly, amongst North American and specifically Native American Catholics, prayer circles have formed around [[Kateri Tekakwitha]], who was the first Native American to be beatified by the [[Roman Catholic Church]]. [[Tekakwitha Conference]] prayer circles, called '''Kateri Prayer Circles,''' have been formed on nearly all U.S. Indian Reservations. In [[Islam]], Muslims who make the pilgrimage to [[Mecca]] will form concentric circles around the [[Kaaba]] in prayer, and these too are commonly referred to as prayer circles.

A prayer circle may also refer to some [[online communities]] where people share their thoughts and prayers with other like-minded worshippers, usually within specially-designated message board areas.

==Origin==
Ritual prayer in a circle around an altar is not unique to [[Christianity]].  Ritual ceremonies around an altar are common in [[paganism]], and ritual prayer dances around an altar were practiced by early Christians, especially [[Gnosticism|Gnostics]], before the practice was condemned as a [[heresy]] by the [[Second Council of Nicaea]] in 787 A.D.  (''See'' Nibley, "The Early Christian Prayer Circle", page 41.)  Much later, [[Protestant]]s began conducting informal prayer circles.  Sometimes these communities are developed online.

==Online ==
With the World Wide Web's rapid growth amongst all sectors of society, many [[Christian]]s and other faith-based peoples have found a niche on the Internet where they can share their prayers, thoughts and wishes with each other. It is not known who was the first to set up an online prayer circle, but today there are dozens, if not hundreds, of Web sites set up for these purposes, from large-scale sites run by The [[American Bible Society]] and [[Beliefnet]] to smaller message boards run by community churches.

An online prayer circle is often a [[vigil]] set up by a participant in honor of someone close to that participant. Larger online prayer circles are also formed in honor and remembrance of the victims of notable [[disaster]]s or [[Tragedy (event)|tragedies]]. Though religious in tone, online prayer circles are generally [[non-denominational]] and at times are not even explicitly Christian.

==Mormonism==
{{main|Prayer circle (Mormonism)}}

In [[Mormonism]], a prayer circle is a mode of prayer practiced by Mormons who have taken part in the [[Endowment (Mormonism)|endowment ceremony]]. Established by [[Joseph Smith]] in 1842 or 1843, he called it the "True Order of Prayer". The ritual involves an [[antiphon]]ic recitation of prayer by participants joined in a circle, usually around an altar inside a [[Temple (Latter Day Saints)|temple]].  Earlier Mormons had practiced conventional Protestant-type prayer circles at least as early as 1833.

In [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]], the largest branch of the [[Latter Day Saint movement]], prayer circles since 1978 are no longer practiced outside of temples, and Mormons do not take part in prayer circles except as part of an endowment ceremony.

'''''Prey''''' is a novel by [[Michael Crichton]], first published in November 2002. An excerpt was published in the January–February 2003 issue of ''[[Seed (magazine)|Seed]]''. Like ''[[Jurassic Park (novel)|Jurassic Park]]'', the novel serves as a [[cautionary tale]] about developments in science and [[technology]]; in this case, [[nanotechnology]], [[genetic engineering]], and [[distributed artificial intelligence]].

The book features relatively new advances in the computing/scientific community, such as [[artificial life]], [[emergence]] (and by extension, [[complexity]]), [[genetic algorithms]], and [[intelligent agent|agent]]-based computing. Fields such as [[population dynamics]] and [[Host–parasite coevolution|host-parasite coevolution]] are also at the heart of the novel.

Film rights to the book were purchased by [[20th Century Fox]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Boehm|first=Erich|url=https://variety.com/1997/film/news/20th-hunts-crichton-s-prey-1117341571|work=Variety|title=20th hunts Crichton’s ‘Prey’}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot summary==
{{long plot|date=April 2016}}
The novel is narrated by the [[protagonist]] Jack Forman, an unemployed software [[programmer]] who used to work for a company called Media Tronics but was fired and blackballed for discovering an internal scandal. As a result, he is forced to take the role of a house husband while his wife Julia serves as a high ranking executive at a [[nanorobotics]] company called Xymos. Julia claims that she is working on a new piece of revolutionary [[imaging technology]] with her company, which takes up most of her time and makes her grow distant to Jack and her family. He starts believing that during her long hours away from home she is having an affair and becomes watchful of her changes.

One night Julia comes home late and shows Jack a video of her demonstrating the Xymos nanobots. In the video, the nanobots are put into a [[Human subject research|human test subject]], and video from inside the body is broadcast in real time. Jack is impressed but becomes more suspicious of her straying when he notices the video was not made on the same day as she said it was. 

Later in the night, their baby girl Amanda awakens in agony as her body turns red from an unknown cause. Jack takes her to the hospital, but the doctors cannot identify the cause of her pain. She is given an [[Magnetic resonance imaging|MRI]] for more examination, then suddenly her pain stops and the skin changes disappear. Bewildered and exhausted, Jack returns home to a strangely indifferent Julia who leaves in a hurry, claiming to go on an urgent business trip.

Strange events happen that lead Jack to suspect something bigger is going on with Julia as their son Eric claims he saw "silver men" cleaning the house in the middle of the night, and Jack finds a strange device found underneath Amanda's bed that wasn't there before, [[Memory card|memory chips]] on their son's electronic game console have turned to dust, Julia has not only become distant but has also become abusive to her family, and Julia was seen driving one night with an unidentifiable passenger in her car. On that same night, Julia is injured in a car crash, and Jack is recruited to consult at Xymos, because the project manager, Ricky  - a good friend of Jack's and former colleague - is having software issues with the nanobots.

Jack is taken to the Xymos research facility in Nevada's [[Great Basin Desert|Basin Desert]], where he is given a tour of the lab, meets the programming team, and is shown a complicated machine used to make the nanobot assemblers from bacteria. Ricky refuses to show Jack the [[source code]] for the nanobots, and later Ricky claims that building contractors failed to properly install filters in a certain vent in the building. As a result, hazardous elements such as the assemblers, the bacteria, and the nanobots were blown into the desert, evolving and eventually forming autonomous swarms. These swarms appear to be clouds of solar-powered and self-sufficient nanobots, [[Reproduction|reproducing]] and [[Evolution|evolving]] ([[necroevolution]]) rapidly. The swarms exhibit [[predator]]y behavior, attacking and killing animals in the wild, using code that Jack himself worked on. Most alarmingly, the swarms seem to possess rudimentary intelligence, the ability to quickly learn and to innovate. Jack also learns that Julia helped teach the swarms to improve their intelligence and become more benign, but they regressed when she left. The swarms tend to wander around the plant during the day but quickly leave when strong winds blow or night falls.

The nanoswarm kills a rabbit outside the complex, and Jack goes outside with Mae to inspect. They find that the rabbit died of suffocation resulting from the nanobots blocking its [[Bronchus|bronchial tubes]]. While Mae goes inside for equipment, Jack is attacked by the swarms. He barely manages to get through the airlock into the lab before falling unconscious from [[anaphylactic shock]].

Persuaded by Jack despite Ricky's protests, the team decides to destroy the swarm or else risk its reproducing exponentially and becoming a [[grey goo]] plague that could endanger humanity. They believe the swarm must have nested in the desert to reproduce. They attempt to find this nest by tagging the swarm with radioactive [[isotope]]s and following them back to their nest at night. Under the cover of a strong wind that forces the swarms to remain dormant, the team goes outside to a storage shack to find the isotopes and build a spray device. However, the wind dies down, and four swarms attack the shack and eventually kill David and Rosie. The rest of the team are forced to take shelter in the cars parked outside.

The swarms find a way to enter the cars, but not long before the wind picks up in speed again. Jack and Mae manage to escape to the lab, but Charley falls unconscious outside his car after spraying his swarm with the isotope. Bobby, Vince, and Ricky refuse to go outside and help Charley. Jack, dizzy and nauseous, goes back out again to save Charley as the swarms attack again. Using a motorbike found in David's car, Jack manages to get himself and the semi-conscious Charley to the safety of the airlock before Jack falls unconscious again.

As night falls, Jack, Mae, and Bobby set out to find the swarms. While searching for them, they discover that the swarms are moving the now deceased Rosie through the desert. The team is also shocked to discover that the swarms can replicate the physical features, perceptions, and motions of humans when they see the swarms form replicas of Ricky, David, and Rosie. 

The group follows the body to find the swarms nesting in a cave. As some of the Ricky-swarms come out of the cave after them, a Xymos helicopter arrives and wards off the swarms using its powerful draft. Mae and Jack then venture into the cave and proceed to exterminate the swarms, their nest, and their organic assembly plant (which looks very similar to the original Xymos assembly plant) using explosive [[thermite]] caps. They return to the Xymos plant, exhausted.

At the plant, Jack, Mae, and Bobby are enthusiastically greeted by Julia, who had discharged herself from the hospital and was brought in by the chopper. Julia's behavior seems to be extremely aberrant; she seems to pay heed to nothing except trying to entice Jack and kissing him, even when Charley is found dead in the locked communications room with a swarm flying around him and the communication links cut. Jack cannot understand how the swarm got inside the rigorously protected airtight building, why Charley would have disabled the facility's communications, or why Julia and Ricky seem to be coming up with various out-of-character ways of how he died.

Mae discovers security footage of when they were in the desert. To Jack's horror, the video not only reveals that Julia and Ricky had an affair but also shows how Charley engaged in a vicious fight with Ricky and Vince. All of them end up in the communications room where Julia kisses a subdued Charley, injecting a stream of swarm into his mouth while Ricky sabotages the communication systems, and they leave Charley to die from the swarm.

Eventually, Jack and Mae realize that everyone in the facility except themselves have been infected by a [[Symbiosis|symbiotic]] version of the nanobot swarms. These nanobots, although evolved alongside the other swarms, do not show aggressive predatory behavior. Instead, while they seem to invigorate their hosts' physical attributes and their emotional perceptions, the nanobots slowly devour and take over their hosts to produce more nanobots, and in the process affect their decision making and then the bots control them, while allowing them to travel and contaminate others.

Jack comes up with a plan to destroy this new strain. Mae and Jack drink vials containing a form of [[bacteriophage|phage]] that kills the nanobot-producing ''[[E. coli]]'' bacteria and thus would protect them from infection by the nanobots. Jack then proceeds to take a sample of the phage and pour it into the sprinkler system and drench everyone with it. He has Mae alert Julia and the infected team. They set out to stop Jack. In the vicious struggle that ensues, Jack is captured and thrown into a magnetic chamber, with Ricky threatening him to either reveal his plan or be killed by the magnets. Jack feigns surrender when Julia walks in to interrogate him, but Jack then reactivates the magnetic chamber with Julia inside, remembering the incident with Amanda in the MRI. Julia's body disintegrates as a swarm is pulled away by the magnetic field to temporarily reveal the real Julia, who has slowly been consumed by the parasitic swarm. Before the swarm can repossess her body, Julia begs Jack to forgive her for putting him in danger, says she loves him, and tells him to stop the swarms and save their children from the same fate, as they have been infected too. Motivated, Jack runs to the roof, fights off the infected team, and finally manages to place the sample into the sprinkler system.

In order to prevent the sprinkler system from triggering, infected-Ricky disables the plant's safety network. However, this is exactly what Jack wants, as Mae has already allowed the phage into the assembly line, causing the phage to reproduce rapidly. The assembly line is rapidly overheating because of the de-activated safety system. If infected-Ricky and infected-Julia don't turn on the safety system the assembly line will burst, filling the lab with the phage. The infected-team, who are now doomed either way, choose to re-activate the safety network and get drenched with the phage. Jack and Mae escape the facility in a helicopter shortly before the facility explodes due to a [[methane]] gas leak combined with [[thermite]] Mae has placed in the building. 

After returning home, Jack doses his children and sister with the phage to eradicate the potential nanobot infestation. Mae calls the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] and sends a sample of the phage to her lab.

Jack puts together all the missing links. The corrosion of the memory chips in his home's electronics and Amanda's skin rash were caused by nanobot assemblers spread by infected-Julia. The MRI's strong magnetic field detached the assemblers from Amanda. Knowing this, Julia called in the Xymos special team to scan Amanda's room. The person whom Jack spotted in Julia's car was in fact the Ricky-swarm. Xymos had intentionally released the swarm into the desert so that it would evolve to stay in a cohesive group in the wind, but then they called him in to destroy the wild strain once it became uncontrollable.

==Reception==
Jim Holt, writing for ''[[The New York Times]]'', found the book "absurd" but exciting, and said that he "kept turning the pages feverishly".&lt;ref name=Holt&gt;{{cite news|last=Holt|first=Jim|title=It's the Little Things|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=950DE6DC1730F937A15752C1A9649C8B63&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=1|accessdate=28 January 2011|newspaper=The New York Times|date=24 November 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Peter Guttridge, writing for ''[[The Observer]]'', said that it finds Crichton "doing what he does best". In that he takes "the very latest scientific advances" and shows "their potentially terrifying underbelly".&lt;ref name=Guttridge&gt;{{cite news|last=Guttridge|first=Peter|title=Outlook cloudy|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2002/dec/15/crime.michaelcrichton|accessdate=28 January 2011|newspaper=The Observer|date=15 December 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even while pointing out the flaws in Crichton's science, in ''Prey'', multiple critics have praised the book's impact and overall message.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.softmachines.org/wordpress/?p=55|author=Jones, Richard |date=December 9, 2004|title=Social and economic aspects of nanotechnology|website=Soft Machines}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=The New York Review of Books|title=The Future Needs Us!

Production assurance normally exists in the context of an enterprise or between producers and oversight bodies, such as regulators.

'''Rau'shee Warren''' (born February 13, 1987) is an American [[professional boxer]] who held the [[WBA (Undisputed)]] and [[International Boxing Organization|IBO]] [[bantamweight]] titles from 2016 to 2017. As an [[amateur boxing|amateur]] he won a gold medal at the [[2007 AIBA World Boxing Championships|2007 World Championships]], as well as bronze at the [[2005 World Amateur Boxing Championships|2005]] and [[2011 AIBA World Boxing Championships|2011 World Championships]], all in the [[flyweight]] division.

==Amateur career==
{{Unreferenced|section|date=January 2017}}
At the [[1st AIBA American 2004 Olympic Qualifying Tournament]] in 2004, at the age of 17, he upset [[Rayonta Whitfield]] and Diego Hurtado and international competitors [[Raúl Castañeda]] ([[Mexico]]), and Miguel Miranda (Venezuela) to qualify as the U.S. boxing team's 106-pound light flyweight representative at the 2004 Athens Olympics. He was both the youngest boxer in the games and the youngest US male in all sports. He was eliminated by the favored  [[Zou Shiming]] of China in the first round.

He moved up to flyweight soon after and in 2005 and 2006 became US champion.  At the [[2005 World Amateur Boxing Championships]] in [[Mianyang]] he avenged a previous loss to European champion [[Georgy Balakshin]] before losing to the Korean surprise winner [[Lee Ok-Sung]] and having to settle for bronze.

In 2006 Light middleweight Akima Stocks and Warren were named ''USA Boxing’s 2006 Athletes of the Year''. That year he also moved up to fight as a bantamweight, and lost to highly regarded Cuban [[Guillermo Rigondeaux]] in November.

In 2007 he returned to the flyweight ranks and repeated as US champion.

At the [[2007 World Amateur Boxing Championships]] in Chicago he defeated European Champion [[Georgy Balakshin]] in a rematch and [[Samir Mammadov]] to reach the finals. In the finals he defeated Thai [[Somjit Jongjohor]].

In 2008 he became the first American boxer in more than 30 years to compete at two Olympic Games, accomplishing something not done since [[Davey Lee Armstrong]] in 1972 and 1976.

At the [[Boxing at the 2008 Summer Olympics|2008 Beijing Olympics]], Warren lost in the first round, again to [[Lee Ok-Sung]], in a controversial decision given that he assumed that he had won on points.

He remained in the amateur ranks and ascended to the bantamweight division again at the US Nationals 2009 where he controversially lost his semifinal 19:19 (countback loss) to eventual champion [[Jesus Magdaleno]].

While competing for the Los Angeles Matadors in the [[World Series of Boxing]], Warren secured a Bronze in the US nationals in 2009, gold in 2010, and in 2011 a bronze at the Worlds. A gold medal in the 2011 individual competition (they also compete for team titles) at the WSB secured champions in 5 WSB weight classes the first Olympic slots, so participation in WSB saw Warren's first near miss at qualifying (only top 2 ranked boxers after team competition selected for individual title fight). Warren won the 2011 US Olympic Trials and came home with the Bronze after the 2011 AIBA World Championships, securing his place in a 3rd Olympics, unprecedented for an American boxer, at only 25 years old.

On August 3, 2012 at the London Olympics, Rau'shee Warren failed to get past the first round of the brackets yet again for the third time of his amateur career losing to Nordine Oubaali of France in a close decision of 19-18.

==Professional career==
Warren made his long-awaited professional debut on November 9, 2012, winning a four-round [[unanimous decision]] over Luis Rivera. Having won thirteen of his first fourteen fights (the only blemish being a three-round [[no contest (boxing)|no contest]] against [[Javier Gallo]] on December 12, 2014), Warren attempted to win his first world championship—the [[WBA (Super)]] and vacant [[International Boxing Organization|IBO]] bantamweight titles—on August 2, 2015, but lost a debatable [[split decision]] to [[Juan Carlos Payano]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.boxingscene.com/payano-edges-raushee-warren-with-split-nod-win--94218 "Payano Edges Rau'shee Warren With Split Nod Win"]. BoxingScene. August 3, 2015. Retrieved January 4, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; In a rematch with Payano on June 18, 2016, Warren gained revenge by winning both titles with a [[majority decision]].&lt;ref&gt;Christ, Scott (June 18, 2016).

''[[SB Nation]]''. [[Vox Media]]. Retrieved January 4, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, Warren lost in his first defense to [[Zhanat Zhakiyanov]] by split decision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boxingscene.com/zhakiyanov-overcomes-knockdowns-upsets-raushee-warren--113506 |title=Zhakiyanov Overcomes Knockdowns, Upsets Rau'shee Warren - Boxing News |publisher=Boxingscene.com |date= |accessdate=2017-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1143">A '''reverse hierarchy''' (or '''inverted pyramid''') is a conceptual [[organizational structure]] that attempts to "invert" or otherwise "reverse" the classical pyramid of [[hierarchical organization]]s.

In the proposed structure, key decisions are made by the [[employee]]s in direct contact with customers, while progressively senior management positions provide support and help to the customer-facing employees.&lt;ref name=Mosley&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mosley| first1=Donald|title=Supervisory Management|date = 2014| publisher=Cengage Learning| page=125|edition=1st|ref = 1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Rostyslav Albertovych Svanidze''' ({{lang-uk|Ростислав Альбертович Сванідзе}}; November 5, 1971{{spaced ndash}}October 14, 2002) was a Ukrainian swimmer of Georgian descent, who specialized in middle-distance freestyle events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite sports-reference|Rostyslav Svanidze|https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/athletes/sv/rostyslav-svanidze-1.html|27 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was a two-time Olympian (1996 and 2000), and a top 16 finalist in the 100 m freestyle at his Olympic debut in [[Atlanta]] (1996). As a member of Ukraine's senior national team, Svanidze had won a total of 37 swimming titles in middle-distance freestyle (100 and 200 m), and in freestyle relays (400 and 800 m). Although he never received a single medal in any international tournament, Svanidze was regarded as one of Ukraine's top swimmers in the post-independence era since the break-up of the [[Soviet Union]]. Before his untimely death in 2002, he worked as a senior lecturer under the faculty of physical education in [[Zaporizhia State Medical University]].

==Swimming career==

===Early years===
Svanidze, a native in [[Tbilisi]], [[Georgian SSR]], started his sporting career at the age of nine. He later became a pupil and a member of the swimming team for Ukraïna Zaporizhzhia, one of Ukraine's top sports clubs, under his longtime coach and mentor Ivan Proskura.&lt;ref name=rsva-death/&gt;

In 1995, Svanidze made his worldwide breakthrough at the [[1995 FINA World Swimming Championships (25 m)|FINA Short Course World Championships]] in [[Rio de Janeiro, Brazil]], where he placed fifth in a freestyle double (100 and 200 m). He also established a new Ukrainian record of 1:48.73 in the 200 m freestyle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Hawrylyshyn|first=George|title=On the road to Atlanta: Ukraine's swimmers take silver medals in Rio|url=http://www.ukrweekly.com/old/archive/1995/519520.shtml|publisher=[[The Ukrainian Weekly]]|date=19–20 May 1995|accessdate=27 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Svanidze became one of the first ever swimmers to attend Ukraine's historic debut at the [[1996 Summer Olympics]] in [[Atlanta]] since the post-Soviet era. In the [[Swimming at the 1996 Summer Olympics – Men's 100 metre freestyle|100 m freestyle]], he powered home with a fourteenth-place effort in the B-Final at 50.43, edging out Canada's [[Stephen Clarke (swimmer)|Stephen Clarke]] in a close finish by two-hundredths of a second (0.02).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Atlanta 1996: Aquatics (Swimming) – Men's 100m Freestyle Final B |url=http://la84foundation.org/6oic/OfficialReports/1996/1996v3p1.pdf |format=[[PDF]] |work=[[Atlanta 1996]] |publisher=[[LA84 Foundation]] |page=36 |accessdate=28 April 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110523164915/http://www.la84foundation.org/6oic/OfficialReports/1996/1996v3p1.pdf |archivedate=23 May 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Team Ukraine at XXVI Summer Olympics|url=http://www.ukrweekly.com/archive/1996/30.pdf|format=[[PDF]]|edition=30|page=10|publisher=[[The Ukrainian Weekly]]|date=28 July 1996|accessdate=25 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2000 Summer Olympics===
{{see also|Swimming at the 2000 Summer Olympics}}

At the [[2000 Summer Olympics]] in [[Sydney]], Svanidze competed in three swimming events, including two freestyle relays. He posted a [[FINA]] B-standard entry time of 1:52.34 (200 m freestyle) from the [[2000 European Aquatics Championships|European Championships]] in [[Helsinki, Finland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Swimming – Men's 200m Freestyle Startlist (Heat 4)|url=http://www.omegatiming.com/File/Download?id=000100060006000000FFFFFFFFFFFF00|format=[[PDF]]|work=[[Sydney 2000]]|publisher=Omega Timing|accessdate=23 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2000 LEN European Aquatics Championships (Helsinki, Finland) – Men's 200m Freestyle Heats|url=http://www.omegatiming.com/File/Download?id=000100090031000000FFFFFFFFFFFF01|format=[[PDF]]|publisher=Omega Timing|accessdate=27 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the first day of the Games, Svanidze teamed up with [[Vyacheslav Shyrshov]], [[Pavlo Khnykin]], and [[Artem Honcharenko]] in the [[Swimming at the 2000 Summer Olympics – Men's 4 × 100 metre freestyle relay|4×100 m freestyle relay]]. Svanidze swam the second leg in heat three and recorded a split of 51.69, but the Ukrainians finished the race in fourth place and twelfth overall with a final time of 3:21.48.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sydney 2000: Swimming – Men's 4×100m Freestyle Relay Heat 3 |url=http://www.la84foundation.org/6oic/OfficialReports/2000/Masters/sw/SWresults.pdf |format=[[PDF]] |work=[[Sydney 2000]] |publisher=[[LA84 Foundation]] |page=336 |accessdate=23 April 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110819181023/http://la84foundation.org/6oic/OfficialReports/2000/Masters/sw/SWresults.pdf |archivedate=19 August 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Newberry|first=Paul|title=Thompson anchors U.S. relay win; Thorpe wins 400 free|url=http://www.canoe.ca/2000GamesSwimming/sep16_tho.html|publisher=[[Canoe.ca]]|date=16 September 2000|accessdate=28 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Swimming at the 2000 Summer Olympics – Men's 200 metre freestyle|200 m freestyle]], Svanidze placed twenty-fourth on the morning prelims.

Shortly after his second Olympics, Svanidze announced his retirement from swimming. He worked as a full-time senior lecturer under the faculty of [[physical education]], [[social pedagogy]], and [[psychology]] at the [[Zaporizhia State Medical University]] in [[Zaporizhia]].&lt;ref name=rsva-death&gt;{{cite news|script-title=uk:Заслуженный тренер украины по плаванию иван проскура: "за три дня до смерти моего ученика ростика сванидзе девушке, которая тренировалась с ним в одном бассейне, приснился сон, будто он умер"|trans-title=Honored coach of Ukraine's Swimming Team Ivan Proskura, "Three days before the death of my student Rostislav Svanidze, a girl who trained with him in the same pool had a dream that he died"|language=Ukrainian|url=http://fakty.ua/83143-zasluzhennyj-trener-ukrainy-po-plavaniyu-ivan-proskura-quot-za-tri-dnya-do-smerti-moego-uchenika-rostika-svanidze-devushke-kotoraya-trenirovalas-s-nim-v-odnom-bassejne-prisnilsya-son-budto-on-umer-quot|publisher=[[Fakty i Kommentarii]]|date=19 October 2002|accessdate=27 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
On October 16, 2002, just three weeks before his thirty-first birthday, Svanidze was found unconscious inside the gymnasium at [[Zaporizhia State Medical University]] after having suffered a [[cardiac arrest]]. He started to become ill while conducting an evening training session for students. He responded to them: "I have a headache; train? probably not; Go to class time, my fellow students". While proceeding to the university's gymnasium, Svanidze felt bad, and eventually collapsed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|script-title=ru:В Запорожье прошли похороны известного украинского пловца Ростичлава Сванидзе|trans-title=In Kiev was the funeral of the famous Ukrainian swimmer Rostyslav Svanidze|language=Russian|url=http://ria.ru/sport/20021016/244365.html|publisher=[[Fakty i Kommentarii]]|date=19 October 2002|accessdate=27 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was found unconscious by one of his students, before being brought to the University's hospital. Eleven minutes later, he was pronounced dead. Doctors discovered that Svanidze had suffered a [[cerebral hemorrhage]], caused by a [[traumatic aortic rupture]], at the time of his death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|script-title=uk:31-летний украинский пловец ростислав сванидзе умер от разрыва аорты, а американский боец даглас дейдж погиб прямо на ринге киевского дворца спорта|trans-title=31-year-old Ukrainian swimmer Rostyslav Svanidze died of aortic rupture, and an American wrestler Douglas Deydzh was killed directly on the ring of the Kiev Palace of Sports|language=Ukrainian|url=http://fakty.ua/79254-31-letnij-ukrainskij-plovec-rostislav-svanidze-umer-ot-razryva-aorty-a-amerikanskij-boec-daglas-dejdzh-pogib-pryamo-na-ringe-kievskogo-dvorca-sporta|publisher=[[Fakty i Kommentarii]]|date=4 July 2003|accessdate=27 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Svanidze's untimely death shocked the nation's entire swimming field. Olympic medalist [[Denys Sylantyev]] recalled his emotion for a posthumous swimmer: "It feels like Rostislav just left. Somewhere far away. He and I have never competed, but we were very good friends. In matters of sport, I did not consult with him, because it is impossible to swim in different distances. None of us sought advice in real-life situations, but there is no request that he had not fulfilled. If you cannot do something, It is no longer a promise. We spent a lot of time in training camp, and more often, made fun of each other." &lt;ref name=rsva-death/&gt;

'''SS ''Clifton''''', originally ''Samuel Mather'', was a [[whaleback]] lake freighter built in 1892 for service on the [[Great Lakes]]. She was {{convert|308|foot}} long, {{convert|30|foot}} beam, and {{convert|24|foot}} depth, and had a 3,500 ton capacity. The self-propelled barge was built by the [[American Steel Barge Company]] in [[Superior, Wisconsin|West Superior, Wisconsin]]. Her builders used a [[naval architecture|design]] well-suited to carry iron ore, her intended trade. The new vessel was christened ''Samuel Mather'', after [[Samuel Mather|a cofounder]] of [[Pickands Mather Group|Pickands Mather and Company]], which at the time was the [[List of Pickands Mather ships|second largest fleet on the Great Lakes]].

After 31 years of service as an ore boat, the vessel was superannuated out of iron ore and was refitted as a carrier of [[Construction aggregate|stone aggregate]]. Her 1923–1924 refitting included the installation of topside self-unloading gear. The Smith-patented tunnel scrapers were intended to enable the ship to unload more quickly and to partially offload at ports that could not previously be serviced by ship.{{sfn|Brehm|2004|pages=[https://books.google.com/books?id=3Z6H8QIk_6wC&amp;pg=PA167 167–174]}}  En route between [[Sturgeon Bay, Wisconsin|Sturgeon Bay]] and [[Detroit]] on the night of September 21–22, 1924, while loaded with crushed stone, she encountered a storm and sank off [[Lake Huron]]'s [[Thunder Bay Island]] with the loss of Captain Emmett Gallagher and the crew.{{efn-ua|Some sources say that there were 28 crew, but the contemporaneous listing was 26.{{sfn|Boyer|1968|pages=40–58}}&lt;ref name="Ashcroft"/&gt;}}

According to one historian, ''Clifton'' became a "ghost ship of the Great Lakes",{{sfn|Boyer|1968|pages=40–58}} as there were no survivors and the events immediately leading up to the disaster were not known. The vessel's wreck was discovered on the bed of Lake Huron by [[technical diving|technical divers]] in September 2016, with the discovery confirmed by further dives and research in 2017. When the lost vessel was rediscovered, it was found that a poetic folk [[ballad]], written before 1932 by an Irish-American neighbor of the lost captain, contained a relatively accurate description of the ship's foundering.{{sfn|Walton|Grimm|2002|pages=[https://books.google.com/books?id=aBiPDKrvyKwC 180–181]}}

==History==
[[File:Clifton.png|thumb|left|Launching the ''Clifton'']]

===Construction and service===
The ''Clifton'' was built by the American Steel Barge Co. and launched in 1892.{{sfn|Devendorf|1996|page=80}} Designed by [[Alexander McDougall (ship designer)|Captain Alexander McDougall]], whalebacks had a unique form. Their unusual design included a hull that curved, which when fully loaded resembled a whale's back. They were the precursors of the [[turret deck ship]] of the late 19th and early 20th century,{{sfn|Woodman|2002|page=179}} which like the whaleback had rounded hulls, but unlike the whaleback had conventional bows and sterns and a superstructure. A total of 44 whaleback vessels were constructed from 1887 to 1898, with most operating in the Great Lakes.{{sfn|Thompson|1994|pages=[https://books.google.com/books?id=irtD2o_uQ88C 47–51]}}{{efn-ua|[[SS Charles W.

After sailing for 31 years, she was deemed superannuated. The ship would no longer transport iron ore, and instead was retrofitted as a carrier of stone aggregate. This 1923–1924 refit included the installation of topside self-unloading gear, which affected her [[center of gravity]] and [[righting moment]].{{sfn|Boyer|1968|pages=40–58}}  As wreck discoverer David Trotter stated: "We found that the self-unloading mechanism was still in position, and that was an interesting discovery because we now realize that the unloading mechanism didn’t break free, causing the Clifton to have instability, resulting in her sinking."

At the time of her loss, ''Clifton'' was owned by the Progress Steamship Co. of Cleveland,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Lake Hides Secret of Lost Boat|work=[[The Plain Dealer]]|date=September 26, 1924|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Dixon&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Institute Search for Missing Freight Vessel |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/14567447/ |work=Dixon Evening Telegraph |page=1 |location=Dixon, Illinois |date=September 25, 1924 |via=[[Newspapers.com]] {{open access}} }}&lt;/ref&gt; a subsidiary of [[Cleveland-Cliffs, Inc.]]{{sfn|Reynolds|Dawson|2011|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=GoXNi5gkTOgC 109]}}

No bodies were recovered, implying that the sinking was quick without deployment of [[Lifeboat (shipboard)|lifeboats]]. No mechanical malfunction has yet been discovered or any other definite cause of her sinking. Speculation at the time, which continued to be published decades after the tragedy, was that the newly-installed self-unloading gear could have broken free and contributed to the vessel's metacentric instability.{{sfn|Boyer|1968|pages=40–58}}  However, after the discovery of the wreck it is now theorized that the vessel was overwhelmed by a wave or waves that drove it under power to the bottom.&lt;ref name="Ramirez"/&gt;  The obliteration of the first {{convert|40|feet}} of the bow is testament to the blunt force the ship endured. "The bow of the Clifton sustained heavy damage", said Trotter, after having seen footage shot by the divers. “The first 40 feet of the bow section is completely destroyed, likely caused by the impact with the lake’s bottom when she sank."&lt;ref name="Ashcroft"/&gt;

===Lament===
Three of the men lost with the ship, including captain Emmett Gallagher, were from the maritime community of [[St. James Township, Michigan|Beaver Island, Michigan]]. The island community, which at the time was predominantly Irish-American, maintained the tradition of generating a [[Folk music|folk-song]] [[lament]] for persons who were seen as having laid down their lives with heroism, and a ballad was written in honor of Captain Gallagher and the crew of ''Clifton''.{{sfn|Walton|Grimm|2002|pages=[https://books.google.com/books/about/Windjammers.html?id=aBiPDKrvyKwC 180–181]}}

Attributed to islander Frank McCauley and collected by a folklore researcher in 1932, "The Seaman's Lament" purports to tell the story of the lost captain and crew. Lines 23 through 26 of the lament are of particular interest, as they set forth a hypothesis that the doomed vessel was slewed by a series of waves, an action equivalent to [[Broach (sailing)|broaching]] on a sailing ship. Once slewed, the cargo vessel was swamped and then foundered.{{sfn|Walton|Grimm|2002|pages=[https://books.google.com/books/about/Windjammers.html?id=aBiPDKrvyKwC 180–181]}}

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
And the mad billows leap like wild beasts from their lair,
And in their wild rush not a life will they spare!
And as they roll on over that structure of steel,
The steamer does tremble from foretop to keel. 
&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

These lines proved to be significant when the vessel was found, as they matched the physical condition of the hull on the lake bottom.&lt;ref name="Ramirez"/&gt;

===Discovery===
Ever since the 1924 sinking, the wreck was considered an ultimate goal for wreck hunters, partly because of its confounding disappearance, and partly because it was the only remaining whaleback to have sunk in Lake Huron and not be found.&lt;ref name="Ashcroft"/&gt; Exacerbating the problem was the sheer size of Lake Huron and potential ship gravesites. The lake has about {{convert|25000|sqmi}} with over {{convert|9000|sqmi}} on the United States side. The data on potential sites was obscure and very oblique, leaving widely scattered possibilities.&lt;ref name="Ashcroft"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ramirez"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Arden"/&gt;

David Trotter, a shipwreck author, discoverer, deep diver, and [[Maritime archaeology|maritime archeologist]], told the press that the lost vessel had been on his "bucket list", ranking close to #1 among non-found Great Lakes shipwrecks.{{efn-ua|Trotter offered that only finding ''[[Le Griffon]],'' a ship lost in 1679, could be better.&lt;ref name="Ashcroft"/&gt;}}  At the time of the discovery, Trotter had found over 60 previously undiscovered wrecks while diving over the last 40 years. Some of his discoveries include sidewheel steamer ''Keystone State'' (1861 sinking with all hands); four-masted schooner, [[Minnedosa (schooner barge)|''Minnedosa'']] (1905 with all hands); and the {{convert|436|ft|m|adj=on}} [[SS Hydrus|''Hydrus'']], lost with all hands in the [[Great Storm of 1913|1913 Great Storm on Lake Huron]].&lt;ref name="Ashcroft"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ramirez"/&gt;

Trotter started his search for ''Clifton'' in 1987. Almost 30 years later, in June 2016, he and his team logged the coordinates of an unknown wreck. He stated that they had been working on a project that involved two other wrecks. The team dived the unknown lost vessel in September 2016, and when the diver surfaced, he reported to Trotter that the unidentified vessel was "a whaleback". Trotter instantly told his crew that they might well have discovered ''Clifton'', as it was the only as-yet-undiscovered whaleback to have been lost on Lake Huron. The senior diver wanted additional confirmation of this discovery before making it public. After deputizing several team members with [[action camera]]s, it was clear that the wreck was indeed a whaleback and was therefore ''Clifton''. Trotter's divers further explored and video-documented the wreck, making nine dives in July–August 2017. Careful work was necessary, as the long-lost hull had been found approximately 100 miles (160&amp;nbsp;km) from where she had been last seen and was believed to have sunk. Trotter made the identification public in September 2017.&lt;ref name="Ashcroft"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.wzzm13.com/news/local/michigan-life/mystery-solved-ss-clifton-discovered-in-lake-huron/477353651 |title=MYSTERY SOLVED:  ‘S.S.

Trotter told the press that ''Clifton''{{`s}} propeller is intact and its rudder pointing straight. Both data points suggest the vessel was moving in a straight line when it sank. Now, "she lies heavily on her port side, [indicating] that she got caught broadside by a very large wave".&lt;ref name="Ramirez"/&gt;  These factors of the discovery tend to support the McCauley hypothesis of the sinking,{{sfn|Walton|Grimm|2002|pages=[https://books.google.com/books?id=aBiPDKrvyKwC 180–181]}} as opposed to speculation that the vessel's self-unloading gear had broken its rigging and was swinging from side to side.{{sfn|Boyer|1968|pages=40–58}} The hull rests at a 45-degree angle to the lake bottom, consistent with being broadsided by a large wave.&lt;ref name="Ashcroft"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ramirez"/&gt;

'''Marie-Florentine Roger''' (in some sources '''Royer''', 1869-?), better known by her English-sounding model name '''Sarah Brown''', probably an affectation due to her Celtic-looking long red hair and pale skin, was a French artist's model famous as the "Queen of Bohemia" in 1890s Paris. Her arrest, along with three other well known artists' models for posing scantily clad as part of [[tableau vivant]] floats at the 1893 [[Bal des Quat'z'Arts]] in Paris' [[Latin Quarter]], provoked one of the most famous [[student riot]]s of the late nineteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;Marie Lathers in Jill Berk Jiminez, ed.,  ''Dictionary of Artists' Models'' 2013 Page 87 "This arrest was the most frequently recalled episode in the life of Sarah Brown; it also provoked one of the most famous student riots of the late 19th century in the Latin Quarter. The incident began with the [[Bal des Quat'z'Arts]]"&lt;/ref&gt; She modeled for [[Jules Lefebrve]], [[Georges Rochegrosse]], and [[Frederick MacMonnies]], among others.

'''Simon de Montfort, 6th Earl of Leicester''' ({{circa|1208}} – 4 August 1265), sometimes referred to as '''Simon V de Montfort''' &lt;!--(also spelt Munford) --&gt;to distinguish him from [[Simon de Montfort (disambiguation)|his namesake relatives]], was a nobleman of French origin and a member of the [[Peerage of England|English peerage]], who led the [[baron]]ial opposition to the rule of King [[Henry III of England]], culminating in the [[Second Barons' War]]. Following his initial victories over royal forces, he became ''[[de facto]]'' ruler of the country,&lt;ref name=dnb&gt;{{cite DNB |last=Norgate |first=K. |display=Montfort, Simon of, Earl of Leicester (1208?–1265) |volume=38 |wstitle=Montfort, Simon of (1208?-1265) |authorlink=Kate Norgate |ref=harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; and played a major role in the constitutional development of England.

During his rule, Montfort called two famous parliaments. [[Oxford Parliament (1258)|The first]] stripped the King of unlimited authority, while [[Simon de Montfort's Parliament|the second]] included ordinary citizens from the towns.&lt;ref name=dnb /&gt; For this reason, Montfort is regarded today as one of the [[wikt:progenitor|progenitors]] of modern [[parliamentary democracy]].&lt;ref name=Jobson2012/&gt; As Earl of Leicester he expelled Jews from the city; as he became ruler of England he also cancelled debts owed to Jews through violent seizures of records. Events in London and Worcester, for instance, led to massacres.&lt;ref name=massacres/&gt;&lt;ref name=DelanyLondon&gt;See Delaney (2002), p217-8 on London&lt;/ref&gt; After a rule of just over a year, Montfort was killed by forces loyal to the King in the [[Battle of Evesham]].&lt;ref name=dnb /&gt;

==Family==
Montfort was a younger son of [[Simon de Montfort, 5th Earl of Leicester]], a French nobleman and crusader, and [[Alix de Montmorency]]. His paternal grandmother was Amicia de Beaumont, the senior co-heiress to the [[Earl of Leicester|Earldom of Leicester]] and a large [[estate (law)|estate]] owned by her brother [[Robert de Beaumont, 4th Earl of Leicester]], in England.

With the irrevocable loss of Normandy, [[John of England|King John]] refused to allow the elder Simon to succeed to the earldom of Leicester and instead placed the estates and title into the hands of Montfort senior's cousin [[Ranulf de Blondeville, 6th Earl of Chester|Ranulf, the Earl of Chester]]. The elder Simon had also acquired vast domains during the [[Albigensian Crusade]], but was killed during the [[Siege of Toulouse (1217–18)|Siege of Toulouse]] in 1218 and his eldest son [[Amaury VI of Montfort|Amaury]] was not able to retain them. When Amaury was rebuffed in his attempt to get the earldom back, he agreed to allow his younger brother Simon to claim it in return for all family possessions in France.

Simon arrived in England in 1229, with some education but no knowledge of English, and received a sympathetic hearing from King [[Henry III of England|Henry]], who was well-disposed towards foreigners speaking [[French language|French]], then the language of the English court. Henry was in no position to confront the powerful Earl of Chester, so Simon approached the older, childless man himself and convinced him to cede him the earldom. It would take another nine years before Henry formally invested him with the title Earl of Leicester.

== Life ==

=== Early life ===
[[File:Simon de Montfort bas-relief in the U.S. House of Representatives chamber.jpg|thumb|[[Relief]] of Simon de Montfort in the [[United States Capitol#House Chamber|Chamber]] of the [[United States House of Representatives]]]]
As a younger son, Simon de Montfort attracted little public attention during his youth, and the date of birth remains unknown. He is first mentioned when his mother made a grant to him in 1217.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Simon de Montfort | last=Maddicott | first=John Robert | page=4 | year=1994 | publisher=Cambridge University Press | location=Cambridge }}&lt;/ref&gt; As a boy, Montfort accompanied his parents during his father's campaigns against the [[Cathars]]. He was with his mother at the [[Siege of Toulouse (1217–1218)|Siege of Toulouse]] in 1218, where his father died after being struck on the head by a stone pitched by a [[mangonel]]. In addition to [[Amaury VI of Montfort|Amaury]], Simon had another older brother, Guy, who was killed at the siege of [[Castelnaudary]] in 1220. As a young man, Montfort probably took part in the [[Albigensian Crusade]]s of the early 1220s. He and Amaury both took part in the [[Barons' Crusade]].

In 1229 the two surviving brothers (Amaury and Simon) came to an arrangement with King Henry whereby Simon gave up his rights in France and Amaury gave up his rights in England. Thus freed from any allegiance to the King of France, Montfort successfully petitioned for the English inheritance, which he received the next year, although he did not take full possession for several years, and did not win formal recognition as Earl of Leicester until February 1239.

Montfort became a favourite of King Henry III and even issued a charter as "Earl of Leicester" in 1236, despite having not yet been granted the title.&lt;ref&gt;Maddicott, p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

In that same year Simon tried to persuade [[Joan, Countess of Flanders]] to marry him. The idea of an alliance between the rich [[County of Flanders]] and a close associate of Henry III of England did not sit well with the French crown. The French Queen Dowager [[Blanche of Castile]] convinced Joan to marry [[Thomas II of Savoy]] instead.

=== Royal marriage ===
[[File:Eleanor Plantagenet, Countess of Leicester.jpg|thumb|right|[[Eleanor of England, Countess of Leicester|Eleanor of England]], who married Montfort in 1238]]
In January 1238, Montfort married [[Eleanor of England, Countess of Leicester|Eleanor of England]], daughter of King [[John of England|John]] and [[Isabella of Angoulême]] and sister of King [[Henry III of England|Henry III]]. While this marriage took place with the King's approval, the act itself was performed secretly and without consulting the great barons, as a marriage of such importance warranted. Eleanor had previously been married to [[William Marshal, 2nd Earl of Pembroke]], and she swore a vow of perpetual [[chastity]] upon his death, when she was sixteen, which she broke by marrying Montfort. The [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], [[Edmund Rich]], condemned the marriage for this reason. The English nobles protested the marriage of the King's sister to a foreigner of modest rank. Most notably, the King's and Eleanor's brother [[Richard, 1st Earl of Cornwall]], rose up in revolt when he learned of the marriage. King Henry eventually bought off Richard with 6,000 marks and peace was restored.

The marriage brought the manor of [[Sutton Valence]] in [[Kent]] into Montfort's possession.&lt;ref name=Valence&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.suttonvalence.org.uk/his/framehistsummary.html |title=The history of Sutton Valence and its buildings, History's hand on Sutton Valence |publisher=Sutton Valence Parish Council |first=David |last=Wilson |accessdate=3 December 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100313225356/http://www.suttonvalence.org.uk/his/framehistsummary.html |archivedate=13 March 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Relations between King Henry and Montfort were cordial at first. Henry lent him his support when Montfort embarked for Rome in March 1238 to seek papal approval for his marriage. When Simon and Eleanor's first son was born in November 1238 (despite rumours, more than nine months after the wedding), he was baptised Henry in honour of his royal uncle. In February 1239, Montfort was finally invested with the [[Earl of Leicester|Earldom of Leicester]]. He also acted as the king's counsellor and was one of the nine godfathers of Henry's eldest son, Prince Edward, who would inherit the throne and become [[Edward I of England|Edward I]] ("Longshanks").

===Expulsion of Jews from Leicester===
As Earl of [[Leicester]], Montfort expelled the small [[Jews|Jewish]] community from the city in 1231, banishing them "in my time or in the time of any of my heirs to the end of the world".&lt;ref&gt;Delany (2002), see page 48&lt;/ref&gt; He justified his action as being "for the good of my soul, and for the souls of my ancestors and successors".&lt;ref&gt;Mundill (2002), p60&lt;/ref&gt; His parents had shown a similar hostility to Jews in France, where his father was known for his devout Christianity, and his mother had given the Jews of [[Toulouse]]&lt;ref&gt;Maddicott, p5-6, describes his mother's Crusader militancy in Toulouse&lt;/ref&gt; a choice of conversion or expulsion.&lt;ref&gt;Graetz (1891), p514&lt;/ref&gt; [[Grosseteste]], then [[List of Archdeacons of Leicester|Archdeacon of Leicester]], may have prompted the expulsion{{citationneeded|reason=other sources appear to contradict this|date=May 2018}} however, Grosseteste appears to have been a restraining influence on the policy.&lt;ref&gt;Levy, S (1902), p38-39&lt;/ref&gt; Expelling the Jews enhanced Montfort's popularity in his new domains because it removed the practice of [[usury]] (widely associated with Jews).&lt;ref&gt;
Maddicott, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Harris |first=Oliver |title=Jews, jurats and the Jewry Wall: a name in context |journal=Transactions of the Leicestershire Archaeological and Historical Society |volume=82 |year=2008 |pages=113–33 (128–33) |url=https://www.le.ac.uk/lahs/downloads/2008/2008%20(82)%20113-133%20Harris.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Leicester's Jews were allowed to move to the eastern suburbs, which were controlled by Montfort's great-aunt [[Margaret, Countess of Winchester]], who had taken advice from [[Grosseteste]].&lt;ref&gt;Levy, S (1902), p38-39&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Crusade and turning against the King ===
[[File:Leicester Clock Tower Simon de Montfort 2.jpg|thumb|right|Statue of Montfort on the [[Haymarket Memorial Clock Tower]] in [[Leicester]]]]
Shortly after Prince Edward's birth, however, there was a falling out between the brothers-in-law. Simon owed a great sum of money to [[Thomas II of Savoy]], uncle of Queen Eleanor, and named King Henry as security for his repayment. The King evidently had not approved this, and was enraged when he discovered that Montfort had used his name. On 9 August 1239, Henry is reported to have confronted Montfort, called him an [[excommunication|excommunicant]] and threatened to imprison him in the [[Tower of London]]. "You seduced my sister", King Henry said, "and when I discovered this, I gave her to you, against my will, to avoid scandal." Simon and Eleanor fled to France to escape Henry's wrath.

Having announced his intention to go on [[crusade]] two years before, Simon raised funds and travelled to the [[Holy Land]] during the [[Barons' Crusade]], but does not seem to have faced combat there. He was part of the crusading host which, under [[Richard, 1st Earl of Cornwall|Richard of Cornwall]], negotiated the release of Christian prisoners including Simon's older brother [[Amaury VI of Montfort|Amaury]]. In autumn 1241, he left [[Syria]] and joined King Henry's campaign against King [[Louis IX of France|Louis IX]] in [[Poitou]]. The campaign was a failure, and an exasperated Montfort declared that Henry should be locked up like King [[Charles the Simple]]. Like his father, Simon was a soldier as well as a capable administrator. His dispute with King Henry came about due to the latter's determination to ignore the swelling discontent within the country, caused by a combination of factors, including famine and a sense among the English Barons that King Henry was too quick to dispense favour to his [[Poitiers|Poitevin]] relatives and [[Savoy]]ard in-laws.

In 1248, Montfort again took the cross with the idea of following [[Louis IX of France]] to [[Egypt]]. But, at the repeated requests of King Henry, he gave up this project in order to act as the king's [[lieutenant in the Duchy of Aquitaine]] (Gascony). Bitter complaints were excited by the rigour with which Montfort suppressed the excesses of the Seigneurs and of contending factions in the great communes. Henry yielded to the outcry and instituted a formal inquiry into Simon's administration. Simon was formally acquitted on the charges of oppression, but his accounts were disputed by Henry and Simon retired to France in 1252. The nobles of France offered him the Regency of the kingdom, vacated by the death of Queen [[Blanche of Castile]]. The earl preferred to make his peace with Henry III, which he did in 1253, in obedience to the exhortations of the dying [[Robert Grosseteste]], Bishop of Lincoln. He helped the King deal with disaffection in Gascony, but their reconciliation was a hollow one. In the Parliament of 1254, Simon led the opposition in resisting a royal demand for a subsidy. In 1256–57, when the discontent of all classes was coming to a head, Montfort nominally adhered to the royal cause. He undertook, with [[Peter II, Count of Savoy|Peter of Savoy]], the Queen's uncle, the difficult task of extricating the King from the pledges which he had given to the [[Pope]] with reference to the Crown of [[Sicily]]; and Henry's writs of this date mention Montfort in friendly terms. But at the "Mad Parliament" of [[Oxford Parliament (1258)|Oxford (1258)]] Montfort appeared with the [[Richard de Clare, 5th Earl of Hertford|Earl of Gloucester]],&lt;ref&gt;Blaauw, William Henry. (1871) ''The barons' war; including the battles of Lewes and Evesham.''[https://books.google.com/books?id=hUELAAAAYAAJ&amp;ots=cmoZpyX0D3&amp;dq=blaauw%2C%20william%20henry&amp;pg=PP2#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false] 2nd Ed.; Baxter and Son; p. 68. Google Book Search. Retrieved on 16 December 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; at the head of the opposition. He was part of the [[Council of Fifteen]] who were to constitute the supreme board of control over the administration. The King's success in dividing the barons and in fostering a reaction, however, rendered such projects hopeless. In 1261, Henry revoked his assent to the [[Provisions of Oxford]] and Montfort, in despair, left the country.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

=== War against the King ===
{{Main article|Second Barons' War}}
[[File:Site of the Battle of Lewes 1264 - geograph.org.uk - 71534.jpg|thumb|right|Site of the Battle of Lewes]]
Simon de Montfort returned to England in 1263, at the invitation of the barons who were now convinced of the King's hostility to all reform and raised a rebellion with the avowed object of restoring the form of government which the Provisions had ordained.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; Cancellation of debts (owed to Jews) was part of his call to arms.&lt;ref&gt;Mundill, 2002 p254 says "Simon de Montfort … used the cancellation of Jewish debts to his own advantage and had managed to convince followers that it was worth rebelling for."&lt;/ref&gt; 

These "cancellations" involved massacres of Jews by his followers to obtain their financial records, for instance in [[Worcester]]&lt;ref&gt;Mundill 2002, p42&lt;/ref&gt; and [[London]].&lt;ref name=DelanyLondon/&gt; The Worcester attack and killings were led by de Montfort's son [[Henry de Montfort|Henry]] and [[Robert de Ferrers, 6th Earl of Derby|Robert Earl Ferrers]].&lt;ref name=bhoworcester&gt;'The city of Worcester: Introduction and borough', in A History of the County of Worcester: Volume 4, ed. William Page and J W Willis-Bund (London, 1924), pp. 376–390. British History Online http://www.british-history.ac.uk/vch/worcs/vol4/pp376-390 [accessed 20 May 2018].&lt;/ref&gt; At London, one of his key followers John fitz John, led the attack and is said to have killed leading Jewish figures Isaac fil Aaron and Cok fil Abraham with his bare hands. He allegedly shared the loot with Montfort. 500 Jews died.&lt;ref name=Mundill2010&gt;Mundill (2010), p88-89&lt;/ref&gt;

His son Simon led a further attack on Jews in [[Winchester]]. Jews in [[Canterbury]],&lt;ref&gt;Mundill (2002), p43&lt;/ref&gt; were murdered or driven out in by a force led by [[Gilbert de Clare, 7th Earl of Gloucester|Gilbert de Clare]]&lt;ref&gt;Richard Huscroft, ''Expulsion: England's Jewish Solution'' (2006), p. 105.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mundill (2002), p42&lt;/ref&gt; There was further violence in [[Lincoln, England|Lincoln]], [[Cambridge]], Wilton&lt;ref&gt;Mundill (2002), p43&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Northampton]].&lt;ref name=Jacobs&gt;Jacobs (1906)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Mundill2010/&gt;

Each attack was aimed at seizure of the records of debts, stored in locked chests within each community called 'archae'. Archae were legally mandated by the king for Jews to be allowed to conduct any business.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Archae |url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/1727-archa |publisher=Jewish Enyclopedia}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were destroyed or gathered for instance at [[Ely, Cambridgeshire|Ely]] by the rebels.&lt;ref&gt;Mundill (2010), p88-99&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Jacobs/&gt;

Henry quickly gave in and allowed Montfort to take control of the council. His son [[Edward I of England|Edward]], however, began using patronage and bribes to win over many of the barons. Their disruption of parliament in October led to a renewal of hostilities, which saw the royalists able to trap Simon in London. With few other options available, Montfort agreed to allow [[Louis IX of France]] to arbitrate their dispute. Simon was prevented from presenting his case to Louis directly on account of a broken leg, but little suspected that the King of France, known for his innate sense of justice, would completely annul the Provisions in his [[Mise of Amiens]] in January 1264. Civil war broke out almost immediately, with the royalists again able to confine the reformist army in London. In early May 1264, Simon marched out to give battle to the King and scored a spectacular triumph at the [[Battle of Lewes]] on 14 May 1264, capturing the King, Prince Edward, and [[Richard of Cornwall]], Henry's brother and the titular King of Germany.

Montfort announced after the Battle of Lewes that all debts owed to the Jews were cancelled, as he had promised.&lt;ref name=Jacobs/&gt;

=== Rule and parliamentary reform ===
{{main|Simon de Montfort's Parliament}}
Montfort used his victory to set up a government based on the provisions first established at Oxford in 1258. Henry retained the title and authority of King, but all decisions and approval now rested with his council, led by Montfort and subject to consultation with parliament. His Great Parliament of 1265 ([[Montfort's Parliament]]) was a packed assembly to be sure, but it can hardly be supposed that the representation which he granted to the towns was intended to be a temporary expedient.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

Montfort sent his summons, in the King's name, to each [[county]] and to a select list of [[borough]]s, asking each to send two representatives. This body was not the first elected [[Parliament of England|parliament]] in England. In 1254, Henry was in Gascony and in need of money. He gave instructions for his regent, Queen Eleanor, to summon a parliament consisting of knights elected by their shires to ask for this 'aid'. Montfort, who was in that parliament, took the innovation further by including ordinary citizens from the boroughs, also elected, and it was from this period that parliamentary representation derives. The list of boroughs which had the right to elect a member grew slowly over the centuries as monarchs granted charters to more English towns. (The last charter was given to Newark in 1674.)

The right to vote in Parliamentary elections for county constituencies was uniform throughout the country, related to land ownership. In the Boroughs, the electoral franchise varied and individual boroughs had varying arrangements.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

=== Fall from power and death ===
{{Main article|Battle of Evesham}}
The reaction against Montfort's government was baronial rather than popular.&lt;ref name=EB1911&gt;{{EB1911|title=Montfort, Simon de|inline=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Welsh Marcher Lord]]s were friends and allies of Prince Edward, and when he escaped in May 1265, they rallied around his opposition. The final nail was the defection of [[Gilbert de Clare, 7th Earl of Gloucester|Gilbert de Clare, the Earl of Gloucester]], the most powerful baron and Simon's ally at Lewes. Clare had grown resentful of Simon's fame and growing power. When he and his brother Thomas fell out with Simon's sons [[Henry de Montfort|Henry]], [[Simon de Montfort, the younger|Simon]], and [[Guy de Montfort, Count of Nola|Guy]], they deserted the reforming cause and joined Edward.

Though boosted by Welsh infantry sent by Montfort's ally [[Llywelyn ap Gruffudd]], Simon's forces were severely depleted. Prince Edward attacked his cousin, his godfather's son Simon's forces at [[Kenilworth]], capturing more of Montfort's allies. Montfort himself had crossed the [[Severn]] with his army, intending to rendezvous with his son [[Simon de Montfort, the younger|Simon]]. When he saw an army approaching at [[Evesham]], Montfort initially thought it was his son's forces. It was, however, Edward's army flying the Montfort banners they had captured at Kenilworth. At that point, Simon realised he had been out-manoeuvred by Edward.

[[File:Montfort Evesham.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|right|A 13th-century cloth depiction of the mutilation of Montfort's body after the Battle of Evesham]]
An ominous black cloud hung over the field of [[Evesham]] on 4 August 1265 as Montfort led his army in a desperate uphill charge against superior forces, described by one chronicler as the "murder of Evesham, for battle it was none".&lt;ref&gt;Robert of Gloucester, ''Chronicle'' translated by Stevenson, Rev. Joseph, ed. (1858) in ''The Church Historians of England: Prereformation series, Volume 5, Part 1''; Seeleys; p. 375.&lt;/ref&gt;  On hearing that his son Henry had been killed, Montfort replied, "Then it is time to die."&lt;ref name=Sharma/&gt; During the battle, a twelve-man squad of Edward's men had stalked the battlefield independent of Edward's main army, their sole aim being to find the earl and cut him down. Montfort was hemmed in; [[Roger Mortimer, 1st Baron Mortimer|Roger Mortimer]] killed Montfort by stabbing him in the neck with a lance.&lt;ref name="Dan Jones p. 280"&gt;Dan Jones, "The Plantagenets: The Kings Who Made England" p. 280&lt;/ref&gt; Montfort's last words were said to have been "Thank God".&lt;ref name=Sharma&gt;{{cite book|first=Simon|last=Sharma|title=A History of Britain|page=184|isbn=0-563-38497-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also slain with Montfort were other leaders of his movement, including [[Peter de Montfort]] and [[Hugh le Despencer, 1st Baron le Despencer|Hugh Despenser]].

Montfort's body was mutilated in a frenzy by the royalists. News reached the mayor and sheriffs of London that "the head of the earl of Leicester ... was severed from his body, and his testicles cut off and hung on either side of his nose";&lt;ref name="Dan Jones p. 280"/&gt; and in such guise the head was sent to [[Wigmore Castle]] by [[Roger Mortimer, 1st Baron Mortimer]], as a gift to his wife, [[Maud de Braose, Baroness Mortimer|Maud]].&lt;ref&gt;Thomas B. Costain, ''The Magnificent Century'', p. 308&lt;/ref&gt; His hands and feet were also cut off and sent to diverse places to enemies of his as a great mark of dishonour to the deceased.&lt;ref&gt;Dan Jones, "The Plantagenets: The Kings Who Made England" pp. 280–281&lt;/ref&gt; Such remains as could be found were buried under the altar of [[Evesham Abbey]] by the canons. It was visited as holy ground by many commoners until King Henry caught wind of it. He declared that Montfort deserved no spot on holy ground and had his remains reburied under an insignificant tree. The remains of some of Montfort's soldiers who had fled the battlefield were found in the nearby village of [[Cleeve Prior]].

Montfort's niece, [[Margaret of England]], later killed one of the soldiers responsible for his death, purposely or inadvertently.

[[Matthew Paris]] reports that the [[Bishop of Lincoln]], [[Robert Grosseteste]], once said to Montfort's eldest son, Henry, "My beloved child, both you and your father will meet your deaths on one day, and by one kind of death, but it will be in the name of justice and truth."

==Legacy==
In the years that followed his death, Simon de Montfort's grave was frequently visited by pilgrims. [[Napoleon|Napoleon Bonaparte]] described Simon de Montfort as "one of the greatest Englishmen".&lt;ref&gt;Napoleon Bonaparte, ''Napoleon's Notes on English History made on the Eve of the French Revolution, illustrated from Contemporary Historians and referenced from the findings of Later Research by Henry Foljambe Hall'' (New York: E. P. Dutton &amp; Co., 1905), 12, 56.&lt;/ref&gt; Today, Montfort is mostly remembered as one of the fathers of [[Representative democracy|representative government]].&lt;ref name=Jobson2012&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jobson|first1=Adrian|title=The First English Revolution: Simon de Montfort, Henry III and the Barons' War|date=2012|publisher=Bloomsbury|isbn=978-1-84725-226-5|pages=173–4|url=https://books.google.com/?id=9gHWamp-TLoC&amp;pg=PA174#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Simon de Montfort: The turning point for democracy that gets overlooked|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-30849472|accessdate=19 January 2015|publisher=BBC|date=19 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The January Parliament and how it defined Britain|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/11355822/The-January-Parliament-and-how-it-defined-Britain.html|accessdate=28 January 2015|publisher=The Telegraph|date=20 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Montfort bears responsibility for [[History_of_the_Jews_in_England_(1066–1290)#Increasing_persecution,_13th_century|persecution of Jews]]. In addition to his expulsion of Jews from Leicester, his faction in the Second Baron's War initiated pogroms killing perhaps the majority of Jews in Worcester and around 500 in London.&lt;ref name=massacres&gt;See Robin R.

[[File:De montfort evesham.jpg|thumb|right|Memorial stone on the site of Montfort's grave, Evesham]]
[[Evesham Abbey]] and the site of Montfort's grave were destroyed with the [[Dissolution of the Monasteries]] in the 16th century. In 1965, a memorial of stone from [[Montfort-l'Amaury]] was laid on the site of the former altar by [[Speaker of the British House of Commons|Speaker of the House of Commons]] Sir [[Harry Hylton-Foster]] and [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], [[Michael Ramsey]].

Various local honours were dedicated to his memory, and he has become eponymous several times over. [[De Montfort University]] in [[Leicester]] is named after him, as is the nearby [[De Montfort Hall]], a concert venue. A statue of Montfort is one of four to adorn the [[Haymarket Memorial Clock Tower]] in [[Leicester]]. A [[relief]] of Montfort adorns the wall of the [[United States Capitol#House Chamber|Chamber]] of the [[United States House of Representatives]].

Montfort's banner called the 'Arms of Honour of Hinckley', blazoned ''party per pale indented argent and gules'', and displayed in stained glass in [[Chartres Cathedral]], is especially used in the coat of arms of the town of [[Hinckley]], part of his Earldom in [[Leicestershire]], and by many of its local organizations. Combined with his personal Coat of Arms, the banner forms part of the club crest for the town's football club [[Hinckley A.F.C.]]&lt;ref name="Hinckley United Independent Club Crest"&gt;{{Cite news

==Descendants==
Simon de Montfort and [[Eleanor of England, Countess of Leicester|Eleanor of England]] had seven children, many of whom were notable in their own right:&lt;ref name=thepeerage&gt;[http://thepeerage.com/p10152.htm#i101518 Record for ''Simon de Montfort, 6th Earl of Leicester'' on ''www.thepeerage.com'']&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Field marshal (United Kingdom)|Field Marshal]] '''Sir William Robert Robertson, 1st Baronet''', {{postnominals|country=GBR|size=100%|sep=,|GCB|GCMG|GCVO|DSO}} (29 January 1860 – 12 February 1933) was a [[British Army]] officer who served as [[Chief of the General Staff (United Kingdom)|Chief of the Imperial General Staff]] (CIGS) – the professional head of the British Army – from 1916 to 1918 during the [[First World War]]. As CIGS he was committed to a [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] strategy focusing on Germany and was against what he saw as peripheral operations on other fronts. While CIGS, Robertson had increasingly poor relations with [[David Lloyd George]], Secretary of State for War and then Prime Minister, and threatened resignation at Lloyd George's attempt to subordinate the British forces to the French Commander-in-Chief, [[Robert Nivelle]]. In 1917 Robertson supported the continuation of the Third Ypres Offensive, at odds with Lloyd George's view that Britain's war effort ought to be focused on the other theatres until the arrival of sufficient US troops on the Western Front.&lt;ref name=ODNB/&gt;

Robertson was the first and only British Army soldier to rise from [[Private (rank)|private soldier]] to field marshal.&lt;ref name=ODNB&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/35786|title=‘Robertson, Sir William Robert, first baronet (1860–1933)’|subscription=yes|first=David R.|last=Woodward|date=September 2004|work=[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|doi=10.1093/ref:odnb/35786|accessdate=7 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Robertson was born in [[Welbourn]], Lincolnshire, the son of Thomas Charles Robertson, a tailor and postmaster of Scottish ancestry, and Ann Dexter Robertson (née Beet).&lt;ref&gt;Bonham-Carter 1963, p1&lt;/ref&gt; He was educated at the local church school and as an older child earned 6d a week as a pupil-teacher. After leaving school in 1873 he became a garden boy in the village rectory, then in 1875 he became a footman in the [[Adeline, Countess of Cardigan and Lancastre|Countess of Cardigan]]'s&lt;ref&gt;she was the widow of the infamous [[James Brudenell, 7th Earl of Cardigan|Lord Cardigan]] who had led the [[Charge of the Light Brigade]]&lt;/ref&gt; household at [[Deene Park]]. He made no mention of this period in his life in his autobiography and seldom spoke of it, although during the First World War he is once said to have remarked to one of his aides: "Boy – I was a damn bad footman."&lt;ref&gt;Bonham-Carter 1963, p2-4&lt;/ref&gt;

He began his military career in November 1877 by enlisting for twelve years as a [[Trooper (rank)|trooper]] in the [[16th The Queen's Lancers|16th (The Queen's) Lancers]].&lt;ref name=ODNB /&gt;&lt;ref name="Woodward, 1998, p1"&gt;Woodward, 1998, p1&lt;/ref&gt; 
As he was three months short of the official minimum age of eighteen, at the behest of the recruiting sergeant he declared his age as eighteen years and two months, these extra five months becoming his "official" age throughout his time in the Army.&lt;ref&gt;Robertson 1921, p. 2 Heathcote p. 250 states that he was five months underage, which is not quite accurate&lt;/ref&gt; 
His mother wrote to him in horror: "You know you are the Great Hope of the Family...if you do not like Service you can do something else...there are plenty of things Steady Young Men can do when they can write and read as you can...(the Army) is a refuge for all idle people...I shall name it to no one for I am ashamed to think of it...I would rather bury you than see you in a red coat."&lt;ref name=ODNB /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bonham-Carter 1963, p5&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mead, 2008, p53-4&lt;/ref&gt; On his first night in the Army he was so horrified by the rowdiness of the barrack room that he contemplated deserting, only to find that his civilian clothes, which had been parcelled up but not yet sent home, had already been stolen by another deserter.&lt;ref&gt;Holmes 2011, p548&lt;/ref&gt;

As a young soldier Robertson was noted for his prowess at running, and for his voracious reading of military history. He won company first prizes for sword, lance and shooting.&lt;ref name="Woodward, 1998, p1"/&gt; Among the young lieutenants under whom he served were future Lieutenant-General [[James Melville Babington|"Jimmy" Babington]] and "Freddy" Blair who would later be Robertson's Military Secretary at Eastern Command in 1918.&lt;ref name="Robertson 1921, p2"&gt;Robertson 1921, p2&lt;/ref&gt; He was promoted to lance-corporal in February 1879 and corporal in April 1879.&lt;ref name="Robertson 1921, p2"/&gt; As a corporal he was imprisoned for three weeks with his head shaven when a soldier under arrest, whom he was escorting, escaped near [[London Waterloo station|Waterloo Station]]. Later, whilst serving in Ireland, he once kept soldiers under arrest handcuffed for a twelve-hour train journey rather than risk a repetition of the event.&lt;ref&gt;Bonham-Carter 1963, p28&lt;/ref&gt;

He was promoted to lance-sergeant in May 1881, and sergeant in January 1882.&lt;ref name="Robertson 1921, p2"/&gt; He obtained a first class certificate of education in 1883, while serving in Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;Bonham-Carter 1963, p31&lt;/ref&gt; Robertson was promoted to [[Troop Sergeant Major|troop sergeant major]] in March 1885, to fill a vacancy as his predecessor, a former medical student serving in the ranks, had been demoted for making a botch of the regimental accounts and later committed suicide.&lt;ref name=ODNB /&gt;&lt;ref name="Robertson 1921, p2"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Holmes 2011, p307&lt;/ref&gt;

==Junior officer==
Encouraged by his officers, and the clergyman of his old parish,&lt;ref name="Woodward, 1998, p1"&gt;Woodward, 1998, p1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=page251&gt;Heathcote, p. 251&lt;/ref&gt; he passed an examination for an officer's commission and was posted as a [[second lieutenant]] in the [[3rd Dragoon Guards]] on 27 June 1888. Normally only four or five rankers were commissioned each year at that time.&lt;ref name="Woodward, 1998, p1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=25832|page=3498|date=26 June 1888}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Robertson later recorded that it would have been impossible to live as a cavalry [[subaltern]] in Britain, where £300 a year was needed in addition to the £120 official salary (approximately £30,000 and £12,000 at 2010 prices) to keep up the required lifestyle; he was reluctant to leave the cavalry,&lt;ref&gt;Mead, 2008, p52&lt;/ref&gt; but his Regiment was deployed to India, where pay was higher and expenses lower than in the UK. Robertson's father made his uniforms and he economised by drinking water with meals and not smoking, as pipes were not permitted in the mess and he could not afford the cigars which officers were expected to smoke. Robertson supplemented his income by studying with native tutors while others slept during the hot afternoons, qualifying as an interpreter—for which officers received cash grants—in [[Urdu]], [[Hindi]], [[Persian language|Persian]], [[Pashto]] and [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]].&lt;ref name=ODNB /&gt;&lt;ref name="Woodward, 1998, p2"&gt;Woodward, 1998, p2&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Chitral 1895 by A D Gardyne.jpg|thumb|right|300px|A scene from the Chitral Expedition in 1895]]
Promoted to [[Lieutenant (British Army and Royal Marines)|lieutenant]] on 1 March 1891,&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=26170|page=3051|date=9 June 1891 |nolink=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; he saw his first active service in 1891, distinguishing himself as Railway Transport Officer for the expedition to Kohat.&lt;ref name="Bonham-Carter 1963, pp34-5"&gt;Bonham-Carter 1963, pp34-5&lt;/ref&gt; He was appointed an [[attaché]] in the Intelligence Branch of the Quartermaster-General's Department at Simla in [[India]] on 5 June 1892.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=26354|page=7399|date=16 December 1892 |nolink=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; There he became a protégé of Sir [[Henry Brackenbury]], the new Military Member of the Viceroy's Council (i.e. equivalent to War Minister for India), who had been Director of Military Intelligence in London and was keen to beef up the intelligence branch of the Indian army, including mapping the [[Military history of the North-West Frontier|Northwest Frontier]]. Robertson spent a year writing a long and detailed "Gazetteer and Military Report on Afghanistan".&lt;ref name="Bonham-Carter 1963, pp34-5"/&gt; After five years in India he was granted his first long leave in 1893, only to find that his mother had died before he reached home.&lt;ref&gt;Bonham-Carter 1963, p32&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 1894 he undertook a three month journey via [[Gilgit]] and mountainous [[Kashmir and Jammu (princely state)|north Kashmir]], crossing the [[Darkot Pass]] at over 15,000 feet to reach the [[Pamir Mountains|Pamirs Plateau]] at the foot of the Himalayas, returning to India in August by a westerly route via [[Chilas]] and Khagan. On the journey he learned [[Gurkhali]] from a Gurkha, later qualifying in this, his sixth Indian language.&lt;ref name="Bonham-Carter 1963, pp34-5"/&gt;

He was promoted to [[Captain (British Army and Royal Marines)|captain]] on 3 April 1895.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=26612|page=1995|date=2 April 1895 |nolink=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; He took part in the [[Chitral Expedition]] as Brigade Intelligence Officer to the force which marched through the [[Malakand Pass]] (he was present at the [[Siege of Malakand]] (3 April 1895)), across the [[Swat River]], via [[Dir, Pakistan|Dir]] to Chitral. He was described by Lieutenant-General [[Robert Low (Indian Army officer)|Sir Robert Low]], the Expedition Commander, as a "very active and intelligent officer of exceptional promise".&lt;ref name="Bonham-Carter 1963, pp35-8"&gt;Bonham-Carter 1963, pp35-8&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=26680|page=6176|date=15 November 1895 |nolink=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the relief of [[Chitral Expedition|Chitral]] and installation of [[Shuja ul-Mulk|Shuja-ul-Mulk]] as Mehtar, Robertson was engaged in pacification and reconnaissance duties, but was wounded when attacked by his two guides on a narrow mountain path during a reconnaissance. One guide was armed with a shotgun and fired at Robertson but missed. The other guide attacked him with Robertson's own sword (which he had been carrying, as Robertson had dysentery) but Robertson punched him to the ground then drove off both attackers with his revolver; one was wounded and later captured and executed.&lt;ref name="Saddington"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nam.ac.uk/whats-on/lunchtime-lectures/video-archive/cleverest-man-army-life-fm-sir-william-robertson |title=Cleverest Man in the Army: The Life of FM Sir William Robertson |author=Saddington, Justin |date=12 December 2011 |work= |publisher=National Army Museum |accessdate=4 November 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121117062048/http://www.nam.ac.uk/whats-on/lunchtime-lectures/video-archive/cleverest-man-army-life-fm-sir-william-robertson |archivedate=17 November 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The incident was reported and illustrated in the ''[[The Graphic|Daily Graphic]]''&lt;ref name="Saddington" /&gt; and Robertson was awarded the [[Distinguished Service Order|DSO]],&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=26701|page=358|date=21 January 1896 |nolink=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was, he later recorded, "then a rather rare decoration".&lt;ref name="Bonham-Carter 1963, pp35-8"/&gt;

==Staff College==
Robertson then applied to attend [[Staff College, Camberley|Staff College]] at [[Camberley]].  Unlike most applicants, he could not afford to take extended leave from his job (on the intelligence staff at [[Shimla|Simla]]) to attend a crammer, and had he failed he would have been too old to apply again, so he rose between 4 and 5 am each day to study mathematics, German, and French with the assistance of his wife. He later qualified as an interpreter in French. He just missed a place, but was given a nominated place on the recommendation of [[George White (British Army officer)|Sir George White]] ([[Commander-in-Chief, India]]).  In 1897, accompanied by his wife and baby son, he became the first former ranker to go there.&lt;ref name=ODNB /&gt;&lt;ref name="Woodward, 1998, p2"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bonham-Carter 1963, p.39-40&lt;/ref&gt;

Under [[George Francis Robert Henderson|George Henderson]] he absorbed the principles, derived from [[Antoine-Henri Jomini|Jomini]], [[Carl von Clausewitz|Clausewitz]], and [[Edward Bruce Hamley|Edward Hamley]]'s ''Operations of War'' (1866), of concentration of physical and moral force and the destruction of the main enemy army.&lt;ref name="Woodward, 1998, p2"/&gt; He passed out second from Staff College in December 1898&lt;ref name=page251&gt;Heathcote, p. 251&lt;/ref&gt; and was then seconded for service in the Intelligence Department at the War Office on 1 April 1899.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=27083|page=3337|date=26 May 1899 |nolink=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a staff captain he was the junior of two officers in the Colonial (later renamed Imperial) section.&lt;ref name="Woodward, 1998, p3"&gt;Woodward, 1998, p3&lt;/ref&gt;

==Boer War and War Office==
With the start of the [[Second Boer War]], Robertson was appointed as Deputy Assistant Adjutant-General to [[Frederick Roberts, 1st Earl Roberts]], the British [[Commander-in-Chief]] South Africa, on 15 January 1900.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=27167|page=1173|date=20 February 1900 |nolink=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was present at the [[Battle of Paardeberg]] (17–26 February 1900), the [[Battle of Poplar Grove]] (7 March 1900) and other battles in March and May.&lt;ref name=page251&gt;Heathcote, p. 251&lt;/ref&gt; Robertson was promoted to [[major]] on 10 March 1900&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=27179|page=2196|date=3 April 1900 |nolink=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was [[mentioned in despatches]] on 2 April 1901.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=27305|page=2605|date=16 April 1901 |nolink=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He returned to the War Office in October 1900 and on 29 November 1900 was promoted [[Brevet (military)|brevet]] [[Lieutenant-colonel (British Army)|lieutenant-colonel]] for his services in [[South Africa]].&lt;ref name=page251&gt;Heathcote, p. 251&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=27359 |date=27 September 1901 |page=6303 |nolink=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 1 October 1901 he was appointed Assistant Quartermaster-General with specific responsibility for the Foreign Military Intelligence section, on the recommendation of the Intelligence expert General Sir [[Henry Brackenbury]],&lt;ref name="Woodward, 1998, p3"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=27456|page=4673|date=22 July 1902 |nolink=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; and worked closely with [[William Nicholson, 1st Baron Nicholson|William Nicholson]] (then Director of Military Operations).&lt;ref name=page251&gt;Heathcote, p. 251&lt;/ref&gt; Although Robertson was later to be a staunch advocate of Britain's concentration of effort on the Western Front, in March 1902 (before the ''[[Entente Cordiale]]'') he wrote a paper ("Treaty Obligations of the British Empire") recommending that, in the event of Belgian neutrality being violated by France or Germany in any future war, Britain should concentrate on naval warfare and deploy no more troops to Belgium than was needed to "afford ocular [visible] proof of our share in the war." His suggestion did not meet with approval at the highest political level: [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs|Foreign Secretary]] [[Henry Petty-Fitzmaurice, 5th Marquess of Lansdowne|Lord Lansdowne]] commented that British policy had always been to deploy a small force immediately and (as had been done in the Boer War) a corps as soon as mobilisation was complete, whilst [[Robert Gascoyne-Cecil, 3rd Marquess of Salisbury|Lord Salisbury]], then in his final months as Prime Minister, commented that he disapproved of such "meditations".&lt;ref&gt;Guinn 1965, p.5 Salisbury thought it unlikely that Belgium would be invaded without support within Belgium, that it could not be predicted in advance whether British opinion would support war, and that policy rather than the letter of treaties would determine whether Britain went to war to defend Belgium; he commented that despite [[Treaty of Paris (1856)|the treaties of 1856]] France, Austria and Britain had not gone to war to defend Turkey when she had been invaded by Russia in [[Russo-Turkish War (1877–78)|1877]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Robertson was promoted to brevet [[Colonel (British Army)|colonel]] on 29 November 1903.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=27624|page=8117|date=8 December 1903 |nolink=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; Having been one of the oldest lieutenants in the army, he was now one of the youngest colonels, heading a staff of nine officers (divided into Imperial, Foreign and Special sections). In the later words of a contemporary, Robertson "became rated as a superman, and only key appointments were considered good enough for him."&lt;ref name="Woodward, 1998, p3"/&gt;

Robertson was made Assistant Director of Military Operations under [[James Grierson]] and appointed a [[Companion of the Order of the Bath]] (CB) on 30 June 1905.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=27811 |supp=y|page=4548|date=27 June 1905 |nolink=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; In spring 1905, during the [[First Moroccan Crisis]], Grierson and Robertson conducted a war game based on a German march through Belgium, Robertson commanding the German forces. They were persuaded that early and strong British intervention – it was assumed that British forces would land at Antwerp – was necessary to slow the German advance and avoid French defeat.&lt;ref name="Tuchman 1962, p55-6"&gt;Tuchman 1962, p55-6&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Guinn 1965, p.9&lt;/ref&gt; In 1906 they toured the Charleroi to Namur area with the French liaison officer Victor Huguet.&lt;ref name="Tuchman 1962, p55-6"/&gt; In 1906 Robertson also toured the Balkans, where he was impressed by the size of the mountains, a factor which was later to influence his scepticism about the Salonika Front during World War I.&lt;ref&gt;Cassar 2011, p83&lt;/ref&gt;

When that job expired in January 1907 Robertson, without a post, was placed on so-called half pay. In fact his salary dropped from £800 to £300, causing him severe financial difficulty, and he earned money by translating German and Austro-Hungarian military manuals into English, again assisted by his wife.&lt;ref name=page251&gt;Heathcote, p. 251&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bonham-Carter 1963, p63&lt;/ref&gt; He became Assistant Quartermaster-General at Headquarters [[Aldershot Command]] on 21 May 1907&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=28023|page=3530|date=21 May 1907 |nolink=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; and then [[Brigadier-general (United Kingdom)|brigadier general]] (equivalent to the modern rank of [[Brigadier-general (British Army)|brigadier]]) on the General Staff at Headquarters Aldershot Command on 29 November 1907.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=28087 |supp=y|page=8607|date=9 December 1907 |nolink=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had hoped for command of a brigade.&lt;ref&gt;Bonham-Carter 1963, p64&lt;/ref&gt; In 1909 he reconnoitred the likely route of a German invasion – Belgium, the Meuse and Luxembourg – with [[Horace Smith-Dorrien|Smith-Dorrien]] and [[Henry Rawlinson, 1st Baron Rawlinson|Rawlinson]].&lt;ref&gt;Bonham-Carter 1963, p68&lt;/ref&gt;

==Commandant, Staff College==
[[File:Staff college camberley.jpg|thumb|left|300px|The Staff College, Camberley where Robertson served as Commandant]]
During Brigadier General (later Field Marshal Sir) [[Henry Hughes Wilson|Henry Wilson]]'s tenure as Commandant at [[Staff College, Camberley]] (1906–10) Robertson had lectured on Belgium, the Canadian frontier and the Balkans.&lt;ref&gt;Jeffery 2006, p83&lt;/ref&gt;

Robertson's patron Nicholson, now [[Chief of the General Staff (United Kingdom)|Chief of the Imperial General Staff]], appointed&lt;ref name=page251&gt;Heathcote, p. 251&lt;/ref&gt; him Commandant at Staff College, effective 1 August 1910.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=28404|page=5670|date= 5 August 1910 |nolink=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Nicholson had initially (according to Wilson) opposed Robertson "because of want of breeding", while Wilson also opposed Robertson's appointment, perhaps feeling that Robertson's lack of private means did not suit him for a position which required entertaining. Robertson thought the Camberley job "greatly underpaid". He wrote to his friend Godley of a "pestilential circle" in top appointments which left "no chance for the ordinary man" and that the combination of Wilson as Director of Military Operations at the War Office (a job which Robertson may well have coveted for himself), [[Spencer Ewart|Ewart]] as Adjutant-General and [[Frederick Stopford|Stopford]] as Commandant of the [[Royal Military College, Sandhurst]], was "enough to make one sick". On 28 July 1910, shortly before taking up his new position, Robertson visited Camberley with [[Herbert Kitchener, 1st Earl Kitchener|Kitchener]], who criticised Wilson. Relations between Wilson and Robertson deteriorated thereafter, beginning a rivalry which was to feature throughout the Great War.&lt;ref&gt;Jeffery 2006, p78-9&lt;/ref&gt;

Robertson was a practical lecturer at Camberley whose teaching included withdrawals as well as advances. [[James Edward Edmonds|Edmonds]], who had been Robertson's classmate in the 1890s, said he was a better lecturer than even Henderson.&lt;ref name="Woodward, 1998, p5"&gt;Woodward, 1998, p5&lt;/ref&gt; He taught officers that they "were at the Staff College to learn Staff Duties and to qualify for Staff Captain, not to talk irresponsible trash" about "subjects of policy or strategy".&lt;ref&gt;Robbins 2005, p36&lt;/ref&gt; These and a number of similar recollections, written up after the Great War, may exaggerate the differences in style between Robertson and Wilson.&lt;ref&gt;Jeffery 2006, p80-1, 83–4&lt;/ref&gt;

He was appointed a [[Commander of the Royal Victorian Order]] on 16 July 1910&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=28398|page=5268|date=22 July 1910 |nolink=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; and promoted to [[major-general]] on 26 December 1910.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=28451|page=9707|date=30 December 1910 |nolink=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Heathcote 1999, p. 251 gives the date as 21 November 1910, but Robertson's own memoirs (p. 379) give the date as December&lt;/ref&gt; He was advanced to [[Knight Commander of the Royal Victorian Order]] on 26 September 1913;&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=28760|page=6823|date=30 September 1913 |nolink=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; on being knighted he mistakenly rose and shook the King's proffered hand instead of kissing it as required by protocol. The King was privately amused and the two men soon formed a good relationship.&lt;ref&gt;Bonham-Carter 1963, p69&lt;/ref&gt; He was appointed Director of Military Training at the [[War Office]] on 9 October 1913.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=28764|page=7153|date=14 October 1913 |nolink=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early in 1914, at an exercise at Staff College, Robertson, acted as Exercise Director, while Wilson acted as chief of staff. Edmonds later wrote that he said to French in a stage whisper "if you go to war with that operations staff, you are as good as beaten."&lt;ref&gt;Holmes 2004, p. 150&lt;/ref&gt; Had war not broken out, French had promised him command of [[1st Infantry Division (United Kingdom)|1st Division]] at [[Aldershot]] in the summer of 1914, in succession to [[Samuel Lomax]].&lt;ref&gt;Bonham-Carter 1963, p. 75&lt;/ref&gt;

==Curragh Incident==
With the Cabinet apparently contemplating some kind of military action against the [[Ulster Volunteers]], it was unclear whether the Director of Military Operations (responsible for operations abroad), the Adjutant-General (responsible for domestic aid to the civil power) or the Director of Military Training (DMT, responsible for home defence) was responsible for drawing up deployment plans. On the evening of 18 March Robertson, who had asked practical questions throughout, was told that it was his responsibility as DMT.&lt;ref&gt;Holmes 2004, p176-7&lt;/ref&gt;

After [[Hubert Gough]] and other officers had threatened to resign (see [[Curragh Incident]]), Robertson also supported Wilson in trying in vain to persuade French ([[Chief of the Imperial General Staff|CIGS]]) to warn the government that the Army would not move against Ulster.&lt;ref&gt;Holmes 2004, p180-1&lt;/ref&gt; The affair led to hatred between senior officers and Liberal politicians. Robertson contemplated resigning, but unlike French and Wilson he emerged without any blot on his reputation.&lt;ref name="Woodward, 1998, p5"/&gt;

==First World War: 1914–15==

===Quartermaster General, BEF===
[[File:4th Bn Royal Fusiliers 22 August 1914.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The Royal Fusiliers preparing for the Battle of Mons]]
Robertson was expected to remain Director of Military Training on the outbreak of the [[First World War]], or to become chief staff officer to the Home Defence Forces.&lt;ref&gt;Bonham-Carter 1963, p84-5&lt;/ref&gt; Instead he replaced [[Archibald Murray|Murray]] (who was promoted to be BEF Chief of Staff) as Quartermaster General of the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War I)|British Expeditionary Force]] (under [[John Denton Pinkstone French, 1st Earl of Ypres|Field Marshal French]]) from 5 August 1914.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=28879|page=6688|date=25 August 1914 |nolink=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Robertson was concerned that the BEF was concentrating too far forward, and discussed a potential retreat with Major-General Robb, Inspector-General of Lines of Communication, as early as 22 August (the day before the [[Battle of Mons]]) when French and Wilson were still talking of advancing.&lt;ref&gt;Holmes 2004, p213&lt;/ref&gt; He arranged supply dumps and contingency plans to draw supply from the Atlantic rather than the Belgian coast, all of which proved invaluable during the retreat from [[Battle of Mons|Mons]]. He became known as "Old Any-Complaints?" as this was his usual question when checking on troops at mealtimes.&lt;ref name="Woodward, 1998, p5"/&gt; In Dan Todman's view, the excellent performance of BEF logistics in August 1914 contrasted favourably with the "almost farcical" performance of the BEF General Staff.&lt;ref name="Sheffield &amp; Todman 2004, p46"&gt;Sheffield &amp; Todman 2004, p46&lt;/ref&gt;

Robertson "felt deeply" the loss of his close friend Colonel Freddy Kerr, who was killed by a shell while serving as GSO1 (chief of staff) to [[2nd Division (United Kingdom)|2nd Division]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Sidney Clive|Clive]] Diary 31 October 1914&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robbins 2005, p.10&lt;/ref&gt;

Robertson was then promoted (over the head of [[Henry Hughes Wilson|Wilson]] who was already Sub Chief of Staff) Chief of Staff (CGS) of the BEF from 25 January 1915.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=29107 |supp=y|page=2819|date=19 March 1915 |nolink=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; Robertson had told Wilson (17 January) that he did not want the promotion as he "could not manage [[John French, 1st Earl of Ypres|Johnnie]], who was sure to come to grief and carry him along with him". (Wilson commented in his diary on the irony of both of the candidates for the job – they were in a car driving to church together at the time – protesting to one another that they did not want it.) Robertson later wrote that he had hesitated to accept the job, despite the higher pay and position, as he knew he was not French's first choice, but had put his duty first. He refused to have Wilson remain as Sub Chief. French was soon impressed by Robertson's "sense and soundness" as CGS.&lt;ref&gt;Holmes 2004, pp. 266–8&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jeffery 2006, pp. 139–43&lt;/ref&gt; Wilson continued to advise French closely whereas Robertson took his meals in a separate mess.  Robertson preferred this, and in common with many other senior BEF officers his relations with French deteriorated badly in 1915.&lt;ref name="Woodward, 1998, p. 23"&gt;Woodward, 1998, p. 23&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chief of Staff, BEF===
Robertson improved the functioning of the staff at GHQ by separating Staff Duties and Intelligence out from Operations into separate sections, each headed by a Brigadier-General reporting to himself (previously, the Operations section had been something of a bottleneck, exacerbated by a personality clash between [[Archibald Murray|Murray]] and [[George Montague Harper|Harper]]).&lt;ref&gt;Sheffield &amp; Todman 2004, p. 46&lt;/ref&gt;

Robertson was advanced to [[Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath]] on 18 February 1915.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=29086|page=2090|date=2 March 1915 |nolink=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Robertson consistently urged strong commitment to the Western Front. He advised on 22 February that Balkan countries would act in their own interests, not those of Britain, and thought the naval attempt to force the [[Gallipoli Campaign|Dardanelles]] "a ridiculous farce".{{efn|Robertson later wrote that the plans (December 1914) for an attack on [[İskenderun|Alexandretta]], dropped to please the French, "had something to be said for them" although he thought later plans for such an attack (in December 1915 or again in 1917) were impractical owing to improved Turkish communications, and in the latter case the presence of German U-boats in the Mediterranean, and the need to devote Allied shipping to bringing US troops to Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Robertson 1921 pp. 314–5&lt;/ref&gt;}}  He also advised French on 2 April 1915 that if the government did not make France the main theatre of operations they should stand on the defensive there.&lt;ref&gt;Woodward, 1998, p. 11, 17&lt;/ref&gt;

Robertson told Hankey on 1 June that Sir John French was "always wanting to do reckless and impossible things" and made similar remarks to Kitchener in July.&lt;ref&gt;Holmes 2004, p. 298&lt;/ref&gt; When French visited London on 23 June to talk to Kitchener, Robertson remained behind as he could not be seen to argue with French in public. He advised on 25 June 1915 against retreat to the Channel Ports, an option contemplated by the Cabinet after the defensive losses at [[Second Battle of Ypres|Second Ypres]], arguing that it would leave the British "helpless spectators" in France's defeat, and on 26 June, in response to a Churchill memorandum, that attacks on entrenched positions at Gallipoli had been just as costly as on the Western Front, but without the chance of defeating the German army. In "Notes on the Machinery of the Government for the Conduct of the War" on 30 June 1915 he argued, in Clausewitzian terms, that the government should state its war aims, in this case, the liberation of Belgium and the destruction of German militarism, and then let the professionals achieve them.&lt;ref name="Woodward, 1998, pp. 35"&gt;Woodward, 1998, pp. 35&lt;/ref&gt;

The King had a "long talk" with Robertson on 1 July and was left convinced that French should be removed as Commander-in-Chief of the BEF.&lt;ref name="Jeffery 2006, pp.150-1, 153"&gt;Jeffery 2006, pp.150–1, 153&lt;/ref&gt; Attending a council of war in London in early July 1915, Robertson was asked at the end if he had any comments—he produced a map and delivered a 45-minute lecture, and when interrupted stood glaring at the minister. His presentation made a strong impression compared to the indecisiveness of the politicians and Kitchener.&lt;ref&gt;Woodward, 1998, p. 11, 19, 23&lt;/ref&gt;

Robertson wrote to Kiggell (20 June 1915) that "these Germans are dug in up to the neck, or concreted" in "one vast fortress" ... "attack on a narrow front &amp; we are enfiladed at once" ... "attack on wide front is impossible because of insufficient ammunition to bombard and break down the defences".&lt;ref&gt;Robbins 2005, p.98&lt;/ref&gt; Tactically, he urged "slow attrition, by a slow and gradual advance on our part, each step being prepared by a predominant artillery fire and great expenditure of ammunition" and stressed the importance of counterbattery work. He also (July 1915) advocated surprise, and realistic objectives to prevent attacking infantry outrunning their artillery cover and ragged lines becoming vulnerable to German counterattack. [[Frederick Barton Maurice|Maurice]], who drafted many of Robertson's memos, had advised him (19 June 1915) that such attacks were best carried out in places where the Germans were, for political or strategic reasons, reluctant to retreat so were bound to take heavy losses.&lt;ref&gt;Woodward, 1998, p12-13, 19&lt;/ref&gt; Robertson initially opposed the mooted [[Battle of Loos|Loos offensive]], recommending (20 July) a more limited attack by [[Second Army (United Kingdom)|Second Army]] to seize Messines-Wyndeschete ridge, and telling Sidney Clive (25 July) it would be "throwing away thousands of lives in knocking our heads against a brick wall".&lt;ref&gt;Woodward, 1998, p12-13&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Holmes 2004, pp.296–8&lt;/ref&gt; He tried to get Sir John "in a better state of mind &amp; not so ridiculously optimistic about a state of German collapse", although he told a conference in July that he and Sir John French "looked out above all things for optimists".&lt;ref&gt;Robbins 2005, p70&lt;/ref&gt;

Robertson also advised (5 August) that Russia, then being [[Great Retreat (Russian)|driven out of Poland]], might make peace without a wholehearted British commitment.&lt;ref&gt;Woodward, 1998, p.11&lt;/ref&gt;

Robertson complained to Wilson (29 July) that French "chopped &amp; changed every day &amp; was quite hopeless" and (12 August) was "very sick with Sir J., he cannot manage him nor influence him"; Wilson noted that relations between French and Robertson were breaking down, and suspected (correctly) that Robertson was blackening French's reputation by sending home documents which French had refused to read or sign.&lt;ref name="Jeffery 2006, pp150-1, 153"&gt;Jeffery 2006, pp150-1, 153&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote a memo to French (3 or 5 August) arguing that the volunteer [[Kitchener's Army|New Armies]] should be committed to the Western Front, an idea to which Kitchener was only reluctantly coming round. French refused to read it, explaining that he was "fully acquainted with the situation", so Robertson sent it to the King's adviser [[Clive Wigram, 1st Baron Wigram|Wigram]] anyway.&lt;ref name="Woodward, 1998, p23"&gt;Woodward, 1998, p23&lt;/ref&gt;

Robertson was made a Grand Officer of the French [[Legion of Honour]] on 10 September 1915&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=29290|page=8986|date=10 September 1915 |nolink=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; and acted as Commander-in-Chief BEF when French was sick in September.&lt;ref&gt;Woodward, 1998, pp23-4&lt;/ref&gt;

===Promotion to CIGS===
[[File:The First World War 1914-1918- Personalities Q69626.jpg|thumbnail|left|Robertson as Chief of the Imperial General Staff during the [[World War I|First World War]]]]
Robertson later wrote in his memoirs that he was not close to Kitchener, having only ever served with him in South Africa.  With Asquith's Coalition Government in danger of breaking up over conscription (which Robertson supported), he blamed Kitchener for the excessive influence which civilians like Churchill and Haldane had come to exert over strategy, allowing ''ad hoc'' campaigns to develop in Sinai, Mesopotamia and [[Macedonian front|Salonika]], and not asking the General Staff (whose chief [[James Wolfe-Murray]] was intimidated by Kitchener) to study the feasibility of any of these campaigns.  Robertson had urged the King's adviser [[Arthur Bigge, 1st Baron Stamfordham|Stamfordham]] (probably June or July 1915) that a stronger General Staff was needed in London, otherwise "disaster" would ensue.  By October 1915 Robertson had come to support greater coordination of plans with the French and was in increasingly close touch with [[Charles Edward Callwell|Charles Callwell]], who had been recalled from retirement to become Director of Military Operations.&lt;ref&gt;Woodward, 1998, p14, 16–17, 20&lt;/ref&gt;

When the King toured the front (24 October) Haig told him that Robertson should go home and become CIGS,&lt;ref name="Jeffery 2006, pp150-1, 153"/&gt; while Robertson told the King (27 October 1915) that Haig should replace French.&lt;ref name="Jeffery 2006, pp153-4"&gt;Jeffery 2006, pp153-4&lt;/ref&gt; He was promoted to permanent [[lieutenant general]] on 28 October 1915.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=29341 |supp=y|page=10615|date=26 October 1915 |nolink=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; Robertson clinched his claim as the future CIGS with a lengthy paper (actually written by Maurice, dated 8 November) "The Conduct of the War", arguing that all British efforts must be directed at the defeat of Germany.&lt;ref&gt;Woodward, 1998, p19&lt;/ref&gt; Robertson told Haig from London (15 November 1915), where he was seeing the King and Kitchener, "the first thing is to get you in command".&lt;ref name="Jeffery 2006, pp153-4"/&gt;
French, finally forced to "resign" early in December 1915, recommended Robertson as his successor and Kitchener told [[Reginald Brett, 2nd Viscount Esher|Esher]] (4 December) that the government intended to appoint Robertson Commander-in-Chief, although to Esher's disappointment "dear old R" was not appointed. Robertson was willing to relinquish his claim if the job went to Haig, his senior and a front line commander since the start of the war.  Conversely, Haig's inarticulacy may also have made him an unappealing choice as CIGS.&lt;ref&gt;Woodward, 1998, p23-4&lt;/ref&gt;

Kitchener and Asquith were agreed that Robertson should become CIGS, but Robertson refused to do this if Kitchener "continued to be his own CIGS", although given Kitchener's great prestige he wanted him not to resign but to be sidelined to an advisory role like the Prussian War Minister. Asquith asked the men to negotiate an agreement, which they did over the exchange of several draft documents at the [[Hotel de Crillon]] in Paris. Kitchener agreed that Robertson alone should present strategic advice to the Cabinet, with Kitchener responsible for recruiting and supplying the Army, and that the Secretary of State should sign orders jointly with the CIGS (Robertson had demanded that orders go out over his signature alone).&lt;ref name="Woodward, 1998, p24"&gt;Woodward, 1998, p24&lt;/ref&gt; Robertson became [[Chief of the General Staff (United Kingdom)|Chief of the Imperial General Staff]] on 23 December 1915,&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=29426 |supp=y|page=120|date=31 December 1915 |nolink=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; with a Royal [[Order in Council]] formalising Kitchener and Robertson's relative positions in January 1916.&lt;ref name="Woodward, 1998, p24"/&gt;

===Initial decisions===
Robertson assumed his duties on 23 December 1915.  He brought with him three able men from GHQ: Whigham (Robertson's Deputy), Maurice (Operations) and MacDonogh (Intelligence).  Their replacements, especially [[Launcelot Kiggell|Kiggell]] (the new CGS BEF), and [[John Charteris|Charteris]] (BEF Intelligence) were much less able than their predecessors, a fact which probably affected BEF performance over the next two years.&lt;ref&gt;Woodward, 1998, pp29&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Robertson's advice to abandon the [[Macedonian front|Salonika bridgehead]] had been overruled at the Allied [[Chantilly Conference]] (6–8 December 1915), his first act as CIGS was to insist on the evacuation of the [[Cape Helles]] bridgehead, which the Royal Navy had wanted to retain as a base and which some (e.g. Balfour, Hankey) had wanted to retain for the sake of British prestige in the Middle East (abandonment of the other Gallipoli bridgehead at Suvla/Anzac, too narrow to defend against enemy artillery, had already been decided on 7 December).&lt;ref&gt;Woodward, 1998, pp112&lt;/ref&gt;

On his first day as CIGS Robertson also demanded a defensive policy in Mesopotamia, with reinforcements drawn only from India – this was agreed on 29 February 1916, over the objections of Balfour and Lloyd George. Robertson also insisted that Mesopotamian operations (and eventually logistics as well) be brought under his control rather than that of the India Office. [[Charles Vere Ferrers Townshend|Townshend]], besieged in [[Siege of Kut|Kut]], was not initially thought to be in danger, but eventually surrendered in April 1916 after three failed relief attempts.&lt;ref&gt;Woodward, 1998, pp113-5&lt;/ref&gt;

Another early act as CIGS (27 December 1915) was to press Kitchener for an extra 18 divisions for the BEF. [[Military Service Act 1916|Conscription of bachelors]] – for which Robertson lobbied – was enacted in early 1916.&lt;ref name="Woodward, 1998, pp44"&gt;Woodward, 1998, pp44&lt;/ref&gt;

==CIGS: 1916==

===Strategic debates===
Robertson was a strong supporter of BEF commander [[Douglas Haig]] and was committed to a [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] strategy focusing on Germany and was against what he saw as peripheral operations on other fronts.&lt;ref name=ODNB/&gt;

Having seen politicians like Lloyd George and Churchill run rings around Kitchener, Robertson's policy was to present his professional advice and keep on repeating it, flatly refusing to enter into debate, arguing that the government should accept his advice or else find another adviser. However, Robertson reduced the government's freedom of action by cultivating the press, much of which argued that the professional leadership of Haig and Robertson was preferable to civilian interference which had led to disasters like Gallipoli and Kut. He was particularly close to [[Howell Arthur Gwynne|H. A. Gwynne]] and [[Charles à Court Repington|Charles Repington]], who worked for the Northcliffe Press until it ceased to support the generals late in 1917, and advised Haig to cultivate journalists also. Robertson communicated by secret letters and "R" telegrams to generals in the field,&lt;ref name="Woodward, 1998, pp30-3"&gt;Woodward, 1998, pp30-3&lt;/ref&gt; including [[George Milne, 1st Baron Milne|Milne]], whom he discouraged from offensive operations at Salonika,&lt;ref&gt;Woodward, 1998, pp33&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Frederick Stanley Maude|Maude]] who may have "consciously or unconsciously" ignored his secret orders from Robertson not to attempt to take Baghdad.&lt;ref&gt;Liddell Hart 1930, p269&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 12 February 1916 paper Robertson urged that the Allies offer a separate peace to Turkey, or else offer Turkish territory to Bulgaria to encourage Bulgaria to make peace. In reply, [[Edward Grey, 1st Viscount Grey of Fallodon|Grey]] pointed out that Britain needed her continental allies more than they needed her, and Britain could not, e.g. by reneging on the promise that Russia could have Constantinople, risk them making a compromise peace which left Germany stronger on the continent.&lt;ref name="Woodward, 1998, pp35"&gt;Woodward, 1998, pp35&lt;/ref&gt;

Robertson told the War Committee (22 February 1916) that the French desire to transfer more troops to Salonika showed a weakening in their resolve for trench warfare. He scorned the idea that it would bring Greece into the war on the Allied side, and at a late March 1916 conference argued with [[Aristide Briand|Briand]] (French Prime Minister) and [[Joseph Joffre|Joffre]], who thumped the table and shouted that Robertson was ''"un homme terrible"''.&lt;ref&gt;At the conference Robertson urged the withdrawal of British divisions from Salonika.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Woodward, 1998, pp33, 36&lt;/ref&gt;

With characteristic bluntness he said of an Italian officer (12 March 1916), who warned that his country might be invaded by Switzerland, "I'd like to have kicked him in the stomach".&lt;ref&gt;Woodward, 1998, p6&lt;/ref&gt;

The War Committee had only agreed (28 December 1915) with some reluctance to make preparations for the Western Front Offensive agreed at Chantilly, which Haig and Joffre agreed (14 February) should be on the Somme, although Robertson and the War Committee were not pleased at Joffre's suggestion that the British engage in "wearing out" attacks prior to the main offensive. For three months, against a backdrop of Russia planning to [[Lake Naroch Offensive|attack]] earlier than agreed, Italy reluctant to [[Fifth Battle of the Isonzo|attack]] at all and the scaling-down of the planned French commitment because of [[Battle of Verdun]], Robertson continued to urge the politicians to agree to the offensive. He increasingly believed that France was becoming exhausted and that Britain would carry an ever greater burden. After Robertson promised that Haig "would not make a fool of himself" (he told Repington that Haig was "a shrewd Scot who would not do anything rash"), the War Committee finally agreed (7 April).&lt;ref&gt;Woodward, 1998, pp38-42&lt;/ref&gt;

Robertson lobbied hard with politicians and the press for the extension of conscription. When the Cabinet finally authorised the Somme Offensive, Robertson had the [[Army Council (1904)|Army Council]] make a statement in favour of conscripting married men. In the face of protests from Bonar Law that the government might break up, to be followed by a General Election (which he thought would be divisive, even though the Conservatives would probably win) and conscription brought in by martial law, Robertson refused to compromise and encouraged [[George Geoffrey Dawson|Dawson]], editor of ''The Times'', to make his stance public.&lt;ref name="Woodward, 1998, pp44"/&gt; After poor relations between French and Kitchener had permitted civilian interference in strategy, Robertson was also determined to stand solid with Haig, telling him (26 April 1916) that they finally had the civilians "into a corner &amp; have the upper hand".&lt;ref name="Woodward, 1998, pp30-3"/&gt;

===Prelude to the Somme===
[[File:River Crossing NGM-v31-p338.jpg|thumb|right|300px|French reserves crossing a river on the way to Verdun]]
Robertson was contemptuous of the [[House Grey Memorandum]] (early 1916) and of President [[Woodrow Wilson]]'s offer to mediate in May 1916. Robertson and Hankey were sent from the room on 24 May 1916 so the politicians could discuss the offer, and McKenna (Exchequer) later told Hankey that he, Asquith, Grey and Balfour, but not Bonar Law or Lloyd George, had been in favour of accepting because of "the black financial outlook". The plan was stopped when the entire [[Army Council (1904)|Army Council]], including Kitchener and Robertson, threatened to resign.&lt;ref&gt;Woodward, 1998, pp36&lt;/ref&gt;

At first Robertson tried to limit information to the War Committee only to a summary of news, most of which had already appeared in the newspapers – this was stopped by Hankey (who called it "really almost an insult to the intelligence of the War Committee") and Lloyd George (22–3 May 1916) when it was discovered that Robertson had moved troops from Egypt and Britain to France with little reference to the War Committee. (Given the logistical difficulties, Robertson scoffed at suggestions that the Turks might invade Egypt, and by July, on his orders, [[Archibald Murray|Murray]] had shipped out 240,000 of the 300,000 British Empire troops in Egypt, including 9 infantry divisions, 3 independent infantry brigades and 9 heavy artillery batteries, most of them going to France, leaving him with 4 Territorial divisions and some mounted troops.&lt;ref&gt;Woodward, 1998, pp116&lt;/ref&gt;) In late May Haig and Robertson also angered ministers by challenging their right to inquire into the shipping of animal fodder to France.&lt;ref name="Woodward, 1998, pp30-3"/&gt;

Robertson told ministers (30 May) that "Haig had no idea of any attempt to break through the German lines. It would only be a move to (rescue) the French", although he was probably not aware of Haig's insistence, overruling Rawlinson's earlier plan, on bombarding deeper into the German defences in the hope of breaking through and "fighting the enemy in the open".&lt;ref&gt;Woodward, 1998, pp42-3&lt;/ref&gt; Maurice later wrote (29 June) Haig "does not mean to knock his head against a brick wall, and if he finds he is only making a bulge and meeting with heavy opposition he means to stop and consolidate and try somewhere else".&lt;ref&gt;Woodward, 1998, pp53 Haig was still toying with the idea of switching BEF efforts to an offensive in Flanders later in the summer&lt;/ref&gt;

Robertson was promoted to permanent [[general]] on 3 June 1916.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=29608 |supp=y|page=5599
|date=2 June 1916 |nolink=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At an Anglo-French conference at 10 Downing Street (9 June) Robertson finally succeeded in blocking a major offensive from Salonika. In response to French pleas that such an attack might bring Romania into the war, Lloyd George continued to lobby throughout July and August. Robertson's view was that Romania would come in as a result of Russian success, if any, and that peace with Bulgaria, although desirable to cut German-Turkish communications, was best sought by diplomatic means.&lt;ref&gt;Woodward, 1998, pp59-62, 74&lt;/ref&gt;

Robertson lobbied hard – briefing against him to Stamfordham and ''The Times'' and the ''Morning Post'' – but in vain to prevent Lloyd George, who made no secret of his desire to use his control over military appointments to influence strategy, succeeding Kitchener as Secretary of State for War. Although Robertson retained the special powers he had been granted in December 1915, and Lord Derby, an ally of the soldiers, was appointed Under-Secretary, Robertson still wrote to Kiggell (26 June 1916) "That d----d fellow L.G. is coming here I fear. I shall have an awful time."&lt;ref&gt;Woodward, 1998, pp58-9&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Somme===
Robertson was clear that it would take more than one battle (28 December 1915, 1 January 1916) to defeat Germany, but like many British generals he overestimated the chances of success on the Somme, noting that Britain had more ammunition and big guns than before, that by attacking on a wide front of 20 miles or so, the attackers would not be subjected to enfilade German artillery fire (in the event this probably spread the artillery too thin, contributing to the [[First Day of the Somme|disaster of 1 July]]) and that attrition would work in the Allies' favour as "the Germans are approaching the limit of their resources".&lt;ref name="Woodward, 1998, p14"&gt;Woodward, 1998, p14&lt;/ref&gt;

Afterwards he wrote to Kiggell (5 July) stressing that "the road to success lies through deliberation" and that "nothing is to be gained but very much is to be lost by trying to push on too rapidly". He recommended "concentration and not dispersion of artillery fire" and "the thing is to advance along a wide front, step by step to very limited and moderate objectives, and to forbid going beyond those objectives until all have been reached by the troops engaged", and urging Kiggell "not to show this letter to anyone". He again wrote to Kiggell (26 July) urging him not let the Germans "beat you in having the better manpower policy".&lt;ref&gt;Robbins 2005, p124&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Woodward, 1998, pp52, 55&lt;/ref&gt;

It was rumoured that Robertson was angling for Haig's job in July,&lt;ref&gt;Travers 1987 p19&lt;/ref&gt; although there is no clear evidence that this was so.&lt;ref name="Woodward, 1998, pp55-7"&gt;Woodward, 1998, pp55-7&lt;/ref&gt; This was the month with the highest British casualties of the entire war, at a time when the German Verdun Offensive was already being scaled back. Haig was reluctant to send Robertson full weekly reports and Robertson complained that Haig's daily telegrams to him contained little more information than the daily press releases. "Not exactly the letter of a CIGS! … He ought to take responsibility also!" was Haig's comment on one such letter (29 July). [[F.E. Smith, 1st Earl of Birkenhead|F.E. Smith]] (1 August) circulated a paper by his friend Winston Churchill (then out of office), criticising the high losses and negligible gains of the Somme. Churchill argued that this would leave Germany freer to win victories elsewhere. Robertson issued a strong rebuttal the same day, arguing that Britain's losses were small compared to what France had suffered in previous years, that Germany had had to quadruple the number of her divisions on the Somme sector and that this had taken pressure off Verdun and contributed to the success of [[Brusilov Offensive|Russian]] and [[Sixth Battle of the Isonzo|Italian]] offensives. After the Churchill memorandum, both Robertson and [[Reginald Brett, 2nd Viscount Esher|Esher]] wrote to Haig reminding him of how Robertson was covering Haig's back in London, Robertson reminding Haig of the need to give him "the necessary data with which to reply to the swines" (7 and 8 August).&lt;ref name="Woodward, 1998, pp55-7"/&gt;

With Allied offensives apparently making progress on all fronts in August, Robertson hoped that Germany might sue for peace at any time and urged the government to pay more attention to drawing up war aims, lest Britain get a raw deal in the face of collusion between France and Russia, whom Robertson also regarded as long-term threats to Britain (as indeed they had been until the early 1900s). Prompted by Asquith, Robertson submitted a memorandum on war aims (31 August). He wanted Germany preserved as a major power as a block to Russian influence, possibly gaining Austria to compensate for the loss of her colonies, Alsace-Lorraine and her North Sea and Baltic ports (including the Kiel Canal).&lt;ref&gt;Woodward, 1998, pp37-8&lt;/ref&gt;

Robertson was initially unimpressed by the appointment (20 August) of [[Paul von Hindenburg|Hindenburg]] as [[Chief of the General Staff (Germany)|German Chief of Staff]], and he knew little about [[Erich Ludendorff|Ludendorff]].&lt;ref&gt;Woodward, 1998, pp60&lt;/ref&gt;

===Clash with Lloyd George===
Robertson correctly guessed that the Bulgarian declaration of war on Romania (1 September) indicated that they had been promised German aid. While Lloyd George, who wanted Greece to be brought into the war on the Allied side, if necessary by a naval bombardment, was visiting the Western Front Robertson persuaded the War Committee (12 September) that Romania was best helped by renewed attacks on the Somme.&lt;ref&gt;Woodward, 1998, pp60-2&lt;/ref&gt;

Robertson had told [[Sir Charles Monro, 1st Baronet|Monro]], the new [[Commander-in-Chief India]], to "keep up a good show" (1 August 1916) in Mesopotamia but wanted to retreat from Kut to Amara rather than make any further attempt to take Baghdad, but this was overruled by [[George Curzon, 1st Marquess Curzon of Kedleston|Curzon]] and [[Austen Chamberlain|Chamberlain]] on the War Committee, which authorised Maude to attack (18 September 1916).&lt;ref&gt;Woodward, 1998, pp118-9&lt;/ref&gt;

Lloyd George criticised Haig to Foch on a visit to the Western Front in September, and proposed sending Robertson on a mission to persuade Russia to make the maximum possible effort. With Royal backing, and despite Lloyd George offering to go himself, Robertson refused to go, later writing to Haig that it had been an excuse for Lloyd George to "become top dog" and "have his wicked way". Lloyd George continued to demand, in the teeth of Robertson's objections, that aid be sent to help Romania, eventually demanding (9 October) that 8 British divisions be sent to Salonika. This was logistically impossible, but to Robertson's anger the War Committee instructed him to consult Joffre. Derby dissuaded him from resigning the next day, but instead he wrote a long letter to Lloyd George (11 October) complaining that Lloyd George was offering strategic advice contrary to his own and seeking the advice of a foreign general, and threatening to resign if his advice was not followed. That same day [[Alfred Harmsworth, 1st Viscount Northcliffe|Northcliffe]] stormed into Lloyd George's office to threaten him (he was unavailable) and the Secretary of State also received a warning letter from Gwynne, who had earlier been highly critical of his interview with Foch. Lloyd George had to give his "word of honour" to Asquith that he had complete confidence in Haig and Robertson and thought them irreplaceable. However, he wrote to Robertson wanting to know how their differences had been leaked to the press (although he affected to believe that Robertson had not personally "authorised such a breach of confidence &amp; discipline") and asserting his right to express his opinions about strategy. The Army Council went on record forbidding unauthorised press contacts, although that did nothing to stop War Office leaks.&lt;ref&gt;Woodward, 1998, pp62-5&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Somme ends===
At the inter-Allied conference at Boulogne (20 October) Asquith supported Robertson in opposing major offensives at Salonika, although Britain had to agree to send a second British division, rather than be the only Ally not to send reinforcements. Robertson wrote to Repington (31 October 1916) "If I were not in my present position I daresay I could find half a dozen different ways of rapidly winning this war. Being in the position I am and knowing what I know I find it not so easy...".&lt;ref&gt;Woodward, 1998, pp65-7&lt;/ref&gt; 
He advised Hankey (31 October 1916) that further high casualties would be needed to defeat Germany's reserves.&lt;ref name="Woodward, 1998, p14"/&gt;

The War Committee met (3 November 1916) without Robertson, so Lloyd George could, in Hankey's words "air his views freely unhampered by the presence of that old dragon Robertson". He complained that the Allies had not achieved any definite success, that the Germans had recovered the initiative, had conquered most of Romania, had increased her forces in the East (after increased mobilisation the German Army had increased in size from 169 ½ divisions on 1 June to 197 divisions (of which 70 were in the East, up from 47 ½ on 1 June)) and still had 4 million men in reserve. On this occasion Asquith backed him and the committee's conclusion, which was neither printed nor circulated, was that "The offensive on the Somme, if continued next year, was not likely to lead to decisive results, and that the losses might make too heavy a drain on our resources having regard to the results to be anticipated." It was agreed to consider offensives in other theatres. The ministers again (7 November) discussed, after Robertson had left the room, the plan to send Robertson to a conference in Russia (all except possibly [[Reginald McKenna|McKenna]] were in favour) and a further inter-Allied conference to upstage the forthcoming conference of generals at Chantilly. Robertson rejected the idea as "the Kitchener dodge" and was angry at the discussion behind his back and, concerned that Lloyd George wanted to "play hanky panky", refused to go.&lt;ref name="Woodward, 1998, pp71-2"&gt;Woodward, 1998, pp71-2&lt;/ref&gt;

Robertson wanted industrial conscription, national service for men up the age of 55, and 900,000 new army recruits, similar to the new German [[Hindenburg Programme]]. He was concerned at the Asquith Coalition's lack of firm leadership, once likening the Cabinet to "a committee of lunatics", and although he avoided taking sides in party politics he urged the creation of a small War Committee which would simply give orders to the departmental ministers, and was concerned (letter to Hankey, 9 November) that ministers might be tempted to make peace or else to reduce Britain's Western Front commitment. Robertson gave an abusive response to the Lansdowne Memorandum (13 November 1916) (calling those who wanted to make peace "cranks, cowards and philosophers … miserable members of society").&lt;ref&gt;Woodward, 1998, pp30-1, 77–8&lt;/ref&gt;

Robertson successfully lobbied Joffre and at the Chantilly Conference (15–16 November 1916) Joffre and Robertson (in Haig's view) "crushed" Lloyd George's proposal to send greater resources to Salonika.&lt;ref&gt;Woodward, 1998, pp66-7&lt;/ref&gt;

The Somme ended on 18 November. There was already divergence between MacDonogh and [[John Charteris|Charteris]] as to the likelihood of German collapse. Robertson had written to Kiggell again (29 September) urging him not to raise expectations too high, and Robertson shocked ministers by forecasting that the war would not end until summer 1918, which proved a broadly accurate forecast. The War Office reported in November and December that the French had suffered much more favourable loss ratios than the British on the Somme, although they attributed better French artillery skills to the French artillery having only increased 2.5 times in size since the start of the war, whereas the British had increased tenfold.&lt;ref&gt;Woodward, 1998, pp30-3, 55–7, 67–70&lt;/ref&gt;

On 21 November, after a discussion about manpower, Asquith again met ministers without Robertson present, and they agreed they could not order him to go to Russia. His influence was already beginning to wane.&lt;ref name="Woodward, 1998, pp71-2"/&gt; In the event departure, originally scheduled for November, was delayed until January and Wilson was sent in Robertson's place.&lt;ref&gt;Jeffery 2006, pp 182–3, 184–7&lt;/ref&gt;

At the second Chantilly Conference it had been agreed that Britain would in future take a greater share of the war on the Western Front. Asquith had written to Robertson (21 November 1916) of the War Committee's unanimous approval of the desirability of capturing or rendering inoperable the submarine and destroyer bases at Ostend and Zeebrugge. Haig and Robertson had obtained Joffre's approval for a British Flanders Offensive, after wearing-out attacks by Britain and France.&lt;ref&gt;Woodward, 1998, pp86&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lloyd George becomes prime minister===
During the December political crisis Robertson advised Lloyd George to "stick to it" and form a three-man War Council, which would probably include the Foreign Secretary but not the First Lord of the Admiralty or the Secretary of State for War. He was suspected of briefing the press against Asquith, and had to assure the Palace that this was not so, and there is no evidence that he did. Had he not ousted Asquith, Lloyd George had planned to appeal to the country, his Military Secretary Colonel [[Arthur Lee, 1st Viscount Lee of Fareham|Arthur Lee]] having prepared a memo blaming Robertson and the General Staff for the loss of Serbia and Romania. Robertson warned the first meeting of the new 5-man War Cabinet (9 December) against the danger of "sideshows". By contrast Hankey (8 December), although he thought Western Front offensives inevitable, advised sending aid to Italy and offensives in Palestine – Lloyd George filed this with the Cabinet papers and used it as the blueprint of future strategy discussions.&lt;ref&gt;Woodward, 1998, pp79-83&lt;/ref&gt;

With Murray's support, in the autumn of 1916 Robertson had resisted attempts to send as many as 4,000 men to [[Rabegh]] to help the nascent [[Arab Revolt]], stressing that logistical support would bring the total up to 16,000 men, enough to prevent Murray's advance on El Arish. Robertson accused the ministers (8 December 1916) of "attaching as much importance to a few scallywags in Arabia as I imagine they did to the [[First Battle of Ypres|German attack on Ypres two years ago]]", but for the first time ministers contemplated overruling him.&lt;ref&gt;Woodward, 1998, pp117&lt;/ref&gt; Encouraged by hope that the Russians might advance to [[Mosul]], removing any Turkish threat to Mesopotamia, Robertson authorised Maude to attack in December 1916.&lt;ref name="Woodward, 1998, pp122, 167"&gt;Woodward, 1998, pp122, 167&lt;/ref&gt;

Robertson advised against accepting Germany's offer (12 December 1916) of a negotiated peace.&lt;ref&gt;Woodward, 1998, pp79&lt;/ref&gt;

During renewed talk of sending more troops to Salonika, Robertson was told not to attend a meeting on 23 December 1916.&lt;ref name="Woodward, 1998, pp83-5"&gt;Woodward, 1998, pp83-5&lt;/ref&gt;

Robertson was appointed [[Aide-de-Camp General]] to [[George V|the King]] on 15 January 1917&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=29911|page=817|date=19 January 1917 |nolink=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was advanced to [[Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath]] on 24 January 1917.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=29916 |supp=y|page=923|date=23 January 1917 |nolink=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following a fractious Anglo-French conference in London (26–8 December) the War Cabinet (30 December) gave Lloyd George authority to "conclude any arrangement" at the forthcoming Rome conference.&lt;ref name="Woodward, 1998, pp83-5"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Jeffery 2006, pp 183–4"&gt;Jeffery 2006, pp 183–4&lt;/ref&gt; On the train to the Rome Conference Robertson formed a low opinion of the new French War Minister, [[Hubert Lyautey]], correctly predicting that he would not last long in his job.&lt;ref&gt;Bonham-Carter 1963, p200&lt;/ref&gt;

At the Rome Conference (5–6 January 1917) Lloyd George, advised by Hankey, proposed sending heavy guns to Italy with a view to defeating Austria-Hungary, possibly to be balanced by a transfer of Italian troops to Salonika. Robertson stressed that this was contrary to agreed policy and hinted that he might resign. [[Luigi Cadorna|Cadorna]] (Hankey suspected he had been "got at by Robertson") stressed the logistical difficulty of accepting the heavy guns, even when Lloyd George removed the precondition that they be returned to the Western Front by May, and even [[Albert Thomas (minister)|Albert Thomas]] (French Minister of Munitions) thought it unwise to remove the guns from the Western Front. Robertson wrote to Lloyd George explicitly threatening to resign if he acted on Briand's impassioned plea to send more divisions to Salonika.&lt;ref name="Woodward, 1998, pp83-5"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Jeffery 2006, pp 183–4"/&gt;

A further Conference followed in London (15–16 January 1917). Cadorna was also once again talking of being able to win a major victory if reinforced by 300 heavy guns or 8 British divisions – Robertson predictably opposed this (29 January).&lt;ref&gt;Woodward, 1998, pp88-9&lt;/ref&gt;

===Calais===
Haig wanted to delay his attack until May to coincide with Italian and Russian attacks, but was told by the government to take over French line as requested, to live up to both the "letter" and "spirit" of the agreement with the new French Commander-in-Chief [[Robert Nivelle|Nivelle]], to be ready no later than 1 April, and not cause delays, almost certainly a result of private lobbying by Nivelle. Robertson was worried about Nivelle forcing the British to attack before the ground dried, although when Haig blamed the poor state of the railways (he demanded twice the railway requirements for half as many troops as the French), he inquired (28 January) whether Haig's staff had obtained an exaggerated figure by simply adding together the highest estimate of every subordinate formation. Haig demanded a meeting between British and French ministers to resolve matters, although Robertson urged him (14 February) to resolve them in a face-to-face meeting with Nivelle and keep the politicians out of it.&lt;ref&gt;Woodward, 1998, pp88-90&lt;/ref&gt;

Robertson later claimed that he attended the [[Calais Conference]] thinking it would be solely about railways, but this is probably untrue. Robertson was at the War Cabinet (20 February) – he told them that Haig and Nivelle were in complete agreement – which insisted on a conference to draw up a formal agreement about "the operations of 1917", and Robertson wrote to Haig (24 February) informing him of this.&lt;ref name="Woodward, 1998, pp90-3"&gt;Woodward, 1998, pp90-3&lt;/ref&gt;

Neither Robertson nor Derby were invited to the War Cabinet on 24 February (no minutes were circulated, but on the train to Calais Hankey was instructed to draw up a summary to be circulated ''after'' the conference), at which ministers felt that the French generals and staff had shown themselves to be more skilful than the British, while politically Britain had to give wholehearted support to what would probably be the last major French effort of the war. Hankey also told Stamfordham that on the train to Calais Lloyd George had informed Robertson and Maurice that he had the authority of the War Cabinet "to decide specifically between Generals Haig &amp; Nivelle", although the subordination of Haig to Nivelle had not been specifically discussed.&lt;ref name="Woodward, 1998, pp90-3"/&gt;

At Calais (26–7 February), after the railway experts had been sent away, at Lloyd George's request Nivelle produced rules governing the relations between the British and French armies, to be binding also on their successors. Nivelle was to exercise, through British staff at [[Grand Quartier Général (1914–1919)|GQG]], operational command (including control of logistics and food) of British forces, with Haig left in control only of discipline (which could not legally be placed in foreign hands) and forbidden to make direct contact with London. Haig, Spears later wrote, "had become a cipher, and (his) units were to be dispersed at the will of the French command, like the Senegalese Regiments, like the Moroccans, like the Foreign Legion, until (his) massed thousands had become mere khaki pawns scattered among the sky-blue pawns"&lt;ref&gt;Spears 1939, p143&lt;/ref&gt;

The plans were brought to Robertson, who feeling unwell had dined with [[Frederick Barton Maurice|Maurice]] in his room, at around 9pm. In Spears' famous account Robertson's face "went the colour of mahogany … his eyebrows slanted outwards like a forest of bayonets held at the charge – in fact he showed every sign of having a fit" He shouted "Get 'Aig!". Haig and Robertson visited Lloyd George – one of Robertson's objections was that the agreement could not be binding on Dominion troops – who told them that he had the authority of the War Cabinet and that, although Nivelle's demands were "excessive", they must have a scheme agreed by 8am. The next morning, after Nivelle had claimed he had not personally drawn up the scheme and professed astonishment that the British generals had not already been told of it, Robertson "ramped up and down the room, talking about the horrible idea of putting "the wonderful army" under a Frenchman, swearing he would never serve under one, nor [[Brian Robertson, 1st Baron Robertson of Oakridge|his son]] either, and that no-one could order him to". Hankey drew up a compromise rather than see Haig and Robertson resign, with Haig still under Nivelle's orders but with tactical control of British forces and right of appeal to the War Cabinet. Robertson later (3 March) regretted even agreeing to this.&lt;ref&gt;Woodward, 1998, pp97-9&lt;/ref&gt;

===Eroding the agreement===
Robertson wrote to Haig (28 February) that Lloyd George was "an awful liar" for claiming that the French had originated the proposal (the Prime Minister had in fact met Major Berthier de Sauvigny (15 February), a French liaison officer in London, telling him that Haig needed to be subordinated to Nivelle for the offensive and that if necessary he would be replaced), and that he lacked the "honesty &amp; truth" to remain Prime Minister. Haig claimed (3 March) that with the BEF spread more thinly by having recently taken over line to the south, German forces (they had recently added 300 battalions by more intensive mobilisation, and by withdrawing to the [[Hindenburg Line]] would later free up an extra 15–20 divisions (135 -180 battalions)) might be used to attack at Ypres and cut him off from the Channel Ports. The French assumed Haig was inventing this threat (possibly true – in the summer of 1917 Haig's staff confessed to MacDonogh of playing up such a threat to avoid cooperating with the French).&lt;ref&gt;Woodward, 1998, pp100-2&lt;/ref&gt;

Robertson, who had been sick in bed, wrote to Haig (3 March) that he did not trust Nivelle. He continued to lobby the War Cabinet ("it was very unpleasant to listen to" wrote Spears) of the folly of leaving the British Army under French control, passing on Haig's demand that he keep control of the British reserves, and advising that intelligence reports suggested preparations for large-scale German troop movements in Eastern Belgium. With War Cabinet opinion having turned against Lloyd George – who was also rebuked by the King – Robertson also then submitted a memorandum stating that the Calais Agreement was not to be a permanent arrangement, along with a "personal statement" so critical of Lloyd George that he refused to have it included in the minutes.&lt;ref&gt;Woodward, 1998, pp102-4&lt;/ref&gt;

The King and [[Reginald Brett, 2nd Viscount Esher|Esher]] also urged Haig and Robertson to come to an agreement with the government.&lt;ref name="Jeffery 2006, pp 187-91"&gt;Jeffery 2006, pp 187–91&lt;/ref&gt;

At another conference in London (12–13 March) Lloyd George expressed the government's full support for Haig and stressed that the BEF must not be "mixed up with the French Army", and Haig and Nivelle met with Robertson and Lyautey to settle their differences. The ''status quo ante'', by which British forces were allies rather than subordinates of the French, but Haig was expected to defer to French wishes as far as possible, was essentially restored.&lt;ref&gt;Woodward, 1998, pp104&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nivelle Offensive===
[[File:Assaut-chemin-des-dames.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Assault on Chemin-des-Dames during the Nivelle Offensive]]
Robertson later came out to Beauvais in March 1917 to demand that Wilson keep him fully informed of all developments.&lt;ref name="Jeffery 2006, pp 187-91"/&gt; On a visit to the Italian Front in March 1917 Robertson was unimpressed by the "white faces and white hands" of many Italian officers, which suggested that they spent too much time at headquarters and not enough time visiting the front lines.&lt;ref name="Woodward, 1998, pp135"&gt;Woodward, 1998, pp135&lt;/ref&gt;

Robertson was sceptical of suggestions that Russia's war effort would be reinvigorated by the [[February Revolution|Fall of the Tsar]], and recommended that Britain keep up the pressure on Germany by attacking on the Western Front. He thought the USA, which had declared war on Germany, would do little to help win the war. Even if President Wilson sent troops to Europe which was by no means certain, it would take until summer 1918 for 250,000 US troops to be available. Robertson prepared another General Staff appraisal (28 March 1917) stressing how the Allied position had deteriorated since the previous summer, and again recommending diplomatic efforts to detach Germany's allies, although he chose not to circulate it to the civilians. Germany had freed an extra 1.7m men for military service, and by the summer of 1917 the German Army would be an extra 1.25m men stronger, an extra 89 divisions (albeit reduced from 12 infantry battalions to 9).&lt;ref&gt;Woodward, 1998, pp104-5, 127&lt;/ref&gt;

The day after the [[Nivelle Offensive]] began, Robertson circulated another paper (17 April) warning that Nivelle would be sacked if he failed – which is indeed what happened – and urging the end of the Calais Agreement.&lt;ref&gt;Woodward, 1998, pp106-7&lt;/ref&gt;

Robertson was awarded the French [[Croix de guerre]] on 21 April 1917&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=30030 |supp=y|page=3823|date=20 April 1917 |nolink=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; and appointed a Knight Grand Cross of the [[Order of Saints Maurice and Lazarus]] on 26 May 1917.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=30263 |supp=y|page=9104|date=31 August 1917 |nolink=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other fronts: Spring 1917===
Lloyd George wanted to make the destruction of Turkey a major British war aim, and two days after taking office told Robertson that he wanted a major victory, preferably the capture of [[Jerusalem]], to impress British public opinion. Robertson thought the capture of [[Beersheba]] should suffice as more divisions were needed to allow Haig to take over more line in France, although he told Murray (31 January 1917) he wanted him to launch a Palestine Offensive, to sustain public morale, in autumn and winter 1917, if the war was still going on then.&lt;ref&gt;Woodward, 1998, pp119-20&lt;/ref&gt;

A January 1917 paper, probably drafted by Macdonogh, argued that, with a compromise peace leaving Germany in control of the Balkans increasingly likely, Britain should protect her Empire by capturing [[Aleppo]], which would make Turkey's hold on Palestine and Mesopotamia untenable. Aleppo could be more easily reached from Palestine than from Mesopotamia, provided Murray had 9–10 infantry divisions, and it was argued that the Turks would have problems assembling 100,000 men to defend it. This paper was much more optimistic than Robertson's later views, but at this stage [[Caucasus Campaign|Russia was still pinning down many Turkish troops]]. When consulted, the Admiralty were less enthused about suggestions that the Royal Navy assist with amphibious landings in Palestine. Except for this one "very secret" memorandum (sent to ministers 22 February 1917) Robertson tried to keep all his discussions of plans against the Turks verbal. It was agreed to build up Murray's forces to 6 infantry divisions and 2 mounted divisions by the autumn, as well 16 Imperial Camel Companies and possibly some Indian cavalry from France.&lt;ref&gt;Woodward, 1998, pp120-1&lt;/ref&gt;

With Maude having [[Fall of Baghdad (1917)|taken Baghdad]] (11 March 1917), the Turks having withdrawn from Persia and been chased out of Medina by the Arabs, and Murray having made an apparently successful [[First Battle of Gaza|attack at Gaza]] (26 March), Robertson asked the War Cabinet (30 March) for permission to order Murray to renew his offensive. Initial reports turned out to have been exaggerated, and [[Second Battle of Gaza|a subsequent attack]] (17–19 April 1917) also failed. This coincided with the failure of the [[Nivelle Offensive]], reports of unrest among Russian troops after the [[February Revolution]] and [[U-boat Campaign (World War I)|an escalation of the U-Boat War]] (it was thought that loss of shipping might make Egypt untenable) causing Robertson to prefer a return to a defensive policy in the Middle East.&lt;ref name="Woodward, 1998, pp122, 167"/&gt;

==CIGS: Summer 1917==

===Robertson's views on Flanders===
As Chief of Staff BEF Robertson had had [[Frederick Barton Maurice|Maurice]], then Director of Military Operations at GHQ, prepare a study of an Ypres Offensive on 15 March 1915. The study had warned that the capture of Ostend and Zeebrugge "would be a very difficult enterprise so far as the nature of the country is concerned" and if successful "would not materially improve the military situation of the Allies in the western theatre" except in the unlikely event that it prompted a general German withdrawal – more likely it would leave the British defending a longer line supplied by only two lines of railway, at "a grave disadvantage" and "in a rather dangerous position" with their backs to the sea as the Germans counterattacked.&lt;ref&gt;Woodward, 1998, pp128&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1917 Robertson was more keen on the idea of the Germans standing and fighting where they would suffer at the hands of strong British artillery. He wrote to Haig (20 April) cautioning against "determination to push on regardless of loss" and repeating Nivelle's error of trying too much to "break the enemy's front" and urged him instead to concentrate on "inflicting heavier losses on (the enemy) than one suffers oneself". It is unclear that the letter had much effect as Haig appointed [[Hubert Gough|Gough]], an aggressive cavalryman, to command the Ypres Offensive shortly after receiving it.&lt;ref name="Woodward, 1998, pp130-1"&gt;Woodward, 1998, pp130-1&lt;/ref&gt;

===France steps back===
With the [[Nivelle Offensive]] in its final stages, Lloyd George went to the Paris Summit authorised by the 1 May 1917 War Cabinet to "press the French to continue the offensive". Lloyd George was keen to build bridges with the generals and told them at Paris (3 May 1917) that he would back their plans ("We must go on hitting and hitting with all our strength") and stressed that they must choose the time and place of the next offensive. The next day Robertson stressed attrition with limited territorial objectives, while Hankey stressed the importance of Zeebrugge, where the Germans would suffer attrition if they stood and fought. Over dinner the Prime Minister reduced the company to "fits of laughter" with an impersonation of Robertson. Robertson thought Paris "about the best Conference we have had". With Russian commitment to the war wavering, Smuts, Milner and Curzon agreed with Robertson that Britain must attack in the west lest France or Italy be tempted to make a separate peace.&lt;ref&gt;Woodward, 1998, pp132-4&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Philippe Petain|Petain]], committed to only limited attacks, became French Commander-in-Chief (15 May) and with [[Reginald Brett, 2nd Viscount Esher|Esher]] warning that the French government would not honour their Paris commitments, Robertson warned Haig that the British government would not take kindly to high casualties if Britain had to attack without wholehearted French support.&lt;ref&gt;Woodward, 1998, pp134&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ferdinand Foch|Foch]], now French chief of staff, also urged Robertson at a meeting (7 June 1917) to conduct only limited attacks (he opposed the planned Flanders Offensive) until the Americans sent more troops, and they discussed the possibility of attacks on Austria-Hungary designed to encourage her to make peace.&lt;ref name="Woodward, 1998, pp135"/&gt;

Robertson and Haig met (9 June) after the victory at [[Battle of Messines (1917)|Messines]]. Robertson warned Haig that the government were diverting manpower into shipbuilding, ship crews and agriculture rather than the Army, and that a prolonged offensive would leave Britain "without an Army" by the autumn, and suggested that attacks against Austria-Hungary might be more prudent. Haig, dismayed, retorted that "Great Britain must … win the war by herself" and that the government were "failing at the XIIth hour". Haig also showed Robertson his "Present Situation and Future Plans" (dated 12 June) in which he argued that he had a good chance of clearing the Belgian Coast provided the Germans were unable to transfer reinforcements from the Eastern Front (in the event German reinforcements did not start to arrive in number until November), and that victory at Ypres "might quite possibly lead to (German) collapse". Robertson told Haig he disagreed with the statistical appendix (prepared by [[John Charteris|Charteris]] who was thought "a dangerous fool" in the War Office) showing German manpower near breaking point and refused to show it to the War Cabinet.&lt;ref name="Woodward, 1998, pp136-8"&gt;Woodward, 1998, pp136-8&lt;/ref&gt;

===War Policy Committee===
The political consensus of May had broken down. Lloyd George told the War Cabinet (8 June) he was dissatisfied with military advice so far and was setting up a War Policy Committee (himself, Curzon, Milner and Smuts) which held 16 meetings over the next six weeks.&lt;ref name="Woodward, 1998, pp136-9"&gt;Woodward, 1998, pp136-9&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jan Smuts|Smuts]], newly appointed to the Imperial War Cabinet, recommended renewed western front attacks and a policy of attrition.&lt;ref&gt;Woodward, 1998, pp132&lt;/ref&gt; He privately thought Robertson "good but much too narrow &amp; not adaptable enough".&lt;ref&gt;Jeffery 2006, pp 193–5&lt;/ref&gt;

Robertson objected to proposals to move 300 heavy guns and 12 divisions to Italy, secretly lobbying Foch, via Spears, in late June 1917. He also warned that the Germans could transfer forces to Italy easily, an attack on Trieste might leave Allied forces vulnerable to counterattack from the north, that Cadorna and his army were not competent, and conversely that they might even make peace if they succeeded in capturing Trieste.&lt;ref name="Woodward, 1998, pp136-9"/&gt;

Robertson wrote to Haig (13 June) that "there is trouble in the land just now". He complained to him of the War Policy Committee's practice of interviewing key people individually to "get at facts" rather than simply setting policy and allowing Robertson and Jellicoe to decide on the military means, and that there would be "trouble" when they interviewed himself and Haig. He wrote that "the (guns) will never go (to Italy) while I am CIGS". He also urged him not to promise, on his forthcoming visit to London, that he could win the war that year but simply to say that his Flanders plan was the best plan, which Robertson agreed it was, so that the politicians would not "dare" overrule both men.&lt;ref name="Woodward, 1998, pp136-9"/&gt;

Haig told the War Policy Committee (19 June, and contrary to Robertson's advice of six days earlier) that "Germany was nearer her end than they seemed to think … Germany was within six months of the total exhaustion of her available manpower, ''if the fighting continues at its present intensity''"&lt;ref&gt;Sheffield &amp; Bourne 2005, p300&lt;/ref&gt; and (20 June) he had no "intention of entering into a tremendous offensive involving heavy losses" while Robertson wanted to avoid "disproportionate loss" (23 June). At this time Haig was involved in discussions as to whether Robertson should be appointed [[First Lord of the Admiralty]] (a ministerial post), and Woodward suggests that he may have felt that Robertson had outlived his usefulness as CIGS. Ministers were not entirely convinced by [[John Rushworth Jellicoe|Jellicoe]]'s warnings about German submarines and destroyers operating from the Belgian ports, but were influenced by France's decline (the opposite to Robertson's original view that this made a major offensive less sensible) and by the apparent success of the [[Kerensky Offensive]]. The Flanders Offensive was finally sanctioned by the War Policy Committee on 18 July and the War Cabinet two days later, on condition that it did not degenerate into a long-drawn out fight like the Somme.&lt;ref&gt;Woodward, 1998, pp140-1&lt;/ref&gt;

To Haig's annoyance the War Cabinet had promised to monitor progress and casualties and, if necessary call a halt. Robertson arrived in France (22 July) to be handed a note from [[Launcelot Kiggell|Kiggell]], urging that the offensive continue to keep France from dropping out (even if Russia or Italy did). Over dinner Haig urged Robertson to "be firmer and play the man; and, if need be, resign" rather than submit to political interference and on his return Robertson wrote to Haig to assure him that he would always advise "supporting wholeheartedly a plan which has once been approved". Robertson met with Cadorna and Foch (24 July) prior to another inter-Allied conference at Paris, and they agreed that the current simultaneous offensives must take priority over Allied reinforcements for Italy, even though it was now clear that the Kerensky Offensive was failing disastrously and that Germany might sooner or later be able to redeploy divisions to the west.&lt;ref name="Woodward, 1998, pp142"&gt;Woodward, 1998, pp142&lt;/ref&gt;

===Middle East: New commander===
[[George Curzon, 1st Marquess Curzon of Kedleston|Curzon]] (12 May 1917) and [[Maurice Hankey|Hankey]] (20 May) continued to urge that Britain seize land in the Middle East. [[Edmund Allenby, 1st Viscount Allenby|Allenby]], [[Archibald Murray|Murray]]'s replacement, had been told by Lloyd George that his objective was "Jerusalem before Christmas" and that he had only to ask for reinforcements, but Robertson warned him that he must take into account the needs of other fronts for men and shipping. Allenby's exact remit was still undecided when he was appointed.&lt;ref name="Woodward, 1998, pp155-9"&gt;Woodward, 1998, pp155-9&lt;/ref&gt;

Allenby arrived on 27 June 1917. Robertson (31 July) wanted him to keep active so as to prevent the Turks concentrating forces in Mesopotamia, although he scoffed at intelligence reports that the Germans might send as many as 160,000 men to that theatre. Allenby was eventually ordered to attack the Turks in southern Palestine, but the extent of his advance was not yet to be decided, advice which Robertson repeated in "secret and personal" notes (1 and 10 August).&lt;ref name="Woodward, 1998, pp155-9"/&gt;

==CIGS: Third Ypres==
[[File:Chateauwood.jpg|thumb|right|300px|A scene from the Third Battle of Ypres]]

===Third Ypres begins===
[[Battle of Passchendaele|Third Ypres]] began on 31 July, with Haig claiming that German losses were double those of the British. Robertson asked Kiggell (2 August) for more information to share with ministers.&lt;ref name="Woodward, 1998, pp142"/&gt;

After the Inter-Allied conference in London (6–8 August 1917), at which Lloyd George had urged the creation of a common Allied General Staff, Robertson again joined with Foch in claiming that there was not time to send heavy guns to Italy for a September offensive. Robertson wrote to Haig (9 August) that Lloyd George would "put up (the useless) Foch against me as he did Nivelle against you in the Spring. He is a real bad 'un."&lt;ref&gt;Woodward, 1998, pp142, 189&lt;/ref&gt; Haig, at the urging of Whigham (Deputy CIGS), wrote to Robertson (13 August) congratulating him at the way he had "supported the sound policy" in London, but complaining that Macdonogh's "pessimistic estimates" of German losses might cause "many in authority to take a pessimistic outlook" whereas "a contrary view, based on equally good information (sic),&lt;ref&gt;in fact Macdonogh's estimates, besides being more accurate than those of Haig's adviser Charteris, were also drawn from a wider range of sources&lt;/ref&gt; would go far to help the nation on to victory".&lt;ref name="Bonham-Carter 1963, pp281-2"&gt;Bonham-Carter 1963, pp281-2&lt;/ref&gt;

With the offensive already bogged down in unseasonably early wet weather, [[John French, 1st Earl of Ypres|French]] (14 August 1917) claimed to [[George Riddell, 1st Baron Riddell|Riddell]] (managing director of the ''News of the World'', and likely to pass on French's views to Lloyd George) that Robertson was "anxious to get the whole of the military power into his own hands, that he is a capable organiser but not a great soldier, and we are suffering from a lack of military genius". Lloyd George suggested that all Robertson's plans be submitted to a committee of French, [[Henry Hughes Wilson|Wilson]] and one other, although Wilson thought this "ridiculous and unworkable".&lt;ref&gt;Jeffery 2006, pp 199–201&lt;/ref&gt;

Robertson wrote to Haig (17 August) warning him of the shortage of manpower, and to "scrape up all the men (he could) in France". He also warned Haig that there were at that time less than 8,000 "A1" soldiers at home, and that Home Forces were largely made up of "boys" of eighteen whom Robertson, having a son only a few years older, thought too young for service in France. Haig had to tell his Army Commanders that the BEF would be 100,000 men under establishment by October.&lt;ref name="Bonham-Carter 1963, pp281-2"/&gt;

The [[Eleventh Battle of the Isonzo]] began (18 August) and on 26 August the British Ambassador in Rome advised that there might be "a complete smashing" of the Austro-Hungarian Army. Robertson advised that it was "false strategy" to call off Third Ypres to send reinforcements to Italy, but after being summoned to George Riddell's home in Sussex, where he was served apple pudding (his favourite dish), agreed to send a message promising support to Cadorna, but only on condition Cadorna promised decisive victory. The Anglo-French leadership agreed in early September to send 100 heavy guns to Italy, 50 of them from the French Army on Haig's left, rather than the 300 which Lloyd George wanted.&lt;ref name="Woodward, 1998, pp144-6"&gt;Woodward, 1998, pp144-6&lt;/ref&gt;

Robertson expressed his concern (15 September) that the heavy shelling necessary to break enemy defences at Ypres was destroying the ground.&lt;ref&gt;Woodward, 1998, pp144&lt;/ref&gt;

As soon as the guns reached Italy Cadorna called off his offensive (21 September).&lt;ref name="Woodward, 1998, pp144-6"/&gt;

===Third Ypres: reluctance to call a halt===
Robertson felt that Lloyd George's proposal for an Anglo-French landing at [[Alexandretta]] would use up too much shipping and told the War Policy Committee (24 September) that he felt Allenby had enough resources to take Jerusalem, although he stressed the logistical difficulties of advancing 400 miles to Aleppo.&lt;ref name="Woodward, 1998, pp159-61"&gt;Woodward, 1998, pp159-61&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bonar Law]], having guessed from a recent talk with Robertson that he had little hope "of anything coming of" Third Ypres, wrote to Lloyd George that ministers must soon decide whether or not the offensive was to continue. Lloyd George travelled to Boulogne (25 September) where he broached with [[Paul Painlevé|Painlevé]] the setting up of an Allied Supreme War Council and then making Foch generalissimo.&lt;ref&gt;Woodward, 1998, pp190-1&lt;/ref&gt; On 26 September Lloyd George and Robertson met Haig to discuss the recent German peace feelers, one of which suggested she might give up her colonies, Belgium, Serbia and Alsace-Lorraine in return for keeping Poland and the Baltic States. Ministers were reluctant to accept this, but at the same time were concerned that Britain could not defeat Germany singlehandedly (in the event the peace feelers were publicly repudiated by Chancellor [[Georg Michaelis|Michaelis]], and Robertson again urged diplomatic efforts to encourage Bulgaria and Turkey to make peace, although the collapse of Russia made this less likely).&lt;ref name="Woodward, 1998, pp146-8"&gt;Woodward, 1998, pp146-8&lt;/ref&gt;

Haig preferred to continue the offensive, encouraged by [[Herbert Plumer|Plumer]]'s recent successful attacks in dry weather at [[Battle of the Menin Road Ridge|Menin Road]] (20 September) and [[Battle of Polygon Wood|Polygon Wood]] (26 September), and stating that the Germans were "very worn out". Robertson spoke to the Army Commanders, but declined Haig's offer that he do so without Haig present. He later regretted not having done so, although he was aware of the ill-feeling which Painlevé had caused when he asked Nivelle's subordinates to criticise him.&lt;ref&gt;Spears 1939 p342&lt;/ref&gt; He later wrote in his memoirs that "I was not prepared to carry my doubts to the point of opposing (Haig)" or of preventing one more push which might have "convert(ed) an inconclusive battle into a decisive victory".&lt;ref name="Woodward, 1998, pp146-8"/&gt;

On his return Robertson wrote Haig an equivocal letter (27 September) stating that he stuck to his advice to concentrate effort on the Western Front rather than Palestine out of instinct and lack of any alternative than from any convincing argument. He also wrote that "Germany may be much nearer the end of her staying power than available evidence shows" but that given French and Italian weakness it was "not an easy business to see through the problem".&lt;ref&gt;Woodward, 1998, pp146-8, 160&lt;/ref&gt;

Robertson's refusal to advise a halt to Third Ypres cost him the support of Smuts and Milner. By the end of the year the Cabinet Committee on Manpower were hearing about an alarming rise in drunkenness, desertions and psychological disorders in the BEF, and reports of soldiers' returning from the front grumbling about "the waste of life" at Ypres, and even Haig himself writing (15 Dec, while arguing against a proposal that the BEF take over line from the French) that many of his divisions were "much exhausted and much reduced in strength".&lt;ref&gt;Woodward, 1998, pp148-9&lt;/ref&gt;

===Palestine manpower requirements===
At the War Policy Committee (3 October) in Robertson's absence, Lloyd George urged greater effort to advance into Syria with a view to knocking Turkey out of the war altogether, and the ministers decided to redeploy 2 divisions from France. Robertson angered the Prime Minister (5 October) by arguing against this, claiming that these troops would be needed in France. He also asked Allenby to state his extra troop requirements to advance from the [[Gaza City|Gaza]]–[[Beersheba]] line (30 miles wide) to the [[Jaffa]]–[[Jerusalem]] line (50 miles wide), urging him to take no chances in estimating the threat of a [[Yildirim Army Group|German-reinforced threat]] (although neither Allenby nor Robertson really thought there was much chance of this happening), but urging Maude not to exaggerate his needs in Mesopotamia.&lt;ref name="Woodward, 1998, pp159-61"/&gt;

Robertson, worried that he would be overruled as Painlevé was visiting London for talks, without waiting for Allenby's reply, claimed (9 October) that 5 divisions would need to be redeployed from France to reach the Jaffa-Jerusalem line, and that Allenby would face at least 16 Turkish divisions (120,000 men). That same day Allenby's own estimate arrived, claiming that he would need 13 extra divisions (an impossible demand even if Haig's forces went on the defensive) and that he might face 18 Turkish and 2 German divisions. Yet in private letters Allenby and Robertson agreed that sufficient British Empire troops were already in place to take and hold Jerusalem. In the event the Germans sent only 3 battalions to Palestine, and Turkish strength there was only 21,000 (out of 110,000 on all fronts) facing 100,000 British Empire troops. The politicians were particularly irritated that they were being shown clearly exaggerated estimates at a time when the General Staff were demanding renewed effort to "divert (Germany's) strategic reserve" to Flanders.&lt;ref&gt;Woodward, 1998, pp161-2&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 8 October paper, Haig claimed that since 1 April 1917, 135 of the 147 German divisions on the Western Front had been driven from their positions or withdrawn after suffering losses, several of them two or three times, and argued that the Allies could beat Germany in 1918 even if Russia were to make peace. The War Cabinet was sceptical, and in his reply (9 October) Robertson, although he thought Haig's memo "splendid", cautioned that German Army morale still seemed to be holding up well.&lt;ref&gt;Woodward, 1998, pp175-6&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Groot 1988, p342-3"&gt;Groot 1988, p342-3&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote to Haig in the same letter that "the Palestine thing will ''not'' come off", and having heard from [[Robert Cecil, 1st Viscount Cecil of Chelwood|Lord Robert Cecil]] that Haig was dissatisfied with him, asked him to "let me do my own job in my own way" in standing up for proper principles of warfare against Lloyd George. He also commented that (Lloyd George) was "out for my blood very much these days" and claimed that "[[Alfred Milner, 1st Viscount Milner|Milner]], [[Edward Carson|Carson]], Cecil, [[George Curzon, 1st Marquess Curzon of Kedleston|Curzon]] and [[Arthur Balfour|Balfour]], have each in turn expressly spoken to me separately about his intolerable conduct", that he hoped "matters would come to a head" at the next Cabinet as he was "sick of this d–d life", that he would "manage" Lloyd George, and that Painleve's recent visit to London had been an attempt to "carry him off his feet" but that he "had big feet!".&lt;ref&gt;Woodward, 1998, pp161&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Blake 1953, p259&lt;/ref&gt;

Robertson also (9 October) advised against the Prime Minister's recent talk of setting up a Supreme War Council, reminding ministers of the Nivelle fiasco and the sending of heavy guns to Italy only for Cadorna to call off his offensive, and wanted Britain to dominate operations in 1918 by virtue of the strength of her army and her political stability.&lt;ref name="Woodward, 1998, pp161–2, 190-1"&gt;Woodward, 1998, pp161-2, 190–1&lt;/ref&gt;

===Politicians seek other advice===
The War Cabinet (11 October 1917) invited Wilson and French to submit formal written advice, a blatant undermining of Robertson's position. Dining with Wilson and French the night before, Lloyd George claimed that Robertson was "afraid of Haig, &amp; that both of them are pigheaded, stupid &amp; narrow visioned".&lt;ref&gt;Jeffery 2006, pp 201–5&lt;/ref&gt;  Wilson and French urged no major war-winning offensive until 1919. Robertson thought the War Cabinet a "weak kneed craven hearted Cabinet ... Lloyd George hypnotises them and is allowed to run riot". Derby had to remind them that Robertson was still their constitutional adviser, and Haig was too busy to come to a planned showdown to which Lloyd George invited him and Robertson.&lt;ref name="Woodward, 1998, pp191"&gt;Woodward, 1998, pp191&lt;/ref&gt; Haig advised Robertson not to resign until his advice had actually been rejected.&lt;ref name="Groot 1988, p342-3"/&gt;

As advised by Wilson and Viscount French, Lloyd George persuaded the War Cabinet and the French to agree to a [[Supreme War Council]]. Hankey (20 October) suspected that the plan of an inter-allied staff of generals in Paris would alone be enough to drive Robertson to resignation. Wilson was appointed British Permanent Military Representative after it had been offered to Robertson (which would have meant giving up his CIGS job). Robertson later claimed in his memoirs that he supported the SWC as a political body, but not the military advisers providing separate advice from the national general staffs.&lt;ref name="Woodward, 1998, pp191"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robertson 1921, p 328&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jeffery 2006, pp 206-7"&gt;Jeffery 2006, pp 206–7&lt;/ref&gt;

==CIGS: 1917–18==

===Rapallo and Paris===
The argument was overtaken by disaster on the Italian front: the [[Battle of Caporetto]] began on 24 October. Robertson later wrote to [[James Edward Edmonds|Edmonds]] in 1932 that although he had kept the diversion of divisions to Italy to a minimum, some reinforcements had to be sent as the Italians would not have been impressed by claims that they were best helped by renewed British attacks in Flanders.&lt;ref&gt;Woodward, 1998, pp176&lt;/ref&gt;

Robertson went to Italy to supervise deployment of British divisions, meeting Lloyd George, Hankey and Wilson when they arrived for the [[Rapallo Conference]] (6–7 November), which formally established the Supreme War Council. Robertson had been told by Hankey that Lloyd George had the War Cabinet's backing, and Lloyd George (Memoirs ii 440-1) later wrote of Robertson's "general sulkiness" and "sullen and unhelpful" attitude at the conference. He walked out of the meeting, telling Hankey "I wash my hands of this business", and contemplated resignation, as he had over the French-Wilson papers.&lt;ref name="Jeffery 2006, pp 206-7"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Woodward, 1998, pp191-2&lt;/ref&gt;

Lloyd George and Robertson had long been briefing the press (mainly the ''Morning Post'' in Robertson's case) against one another. After Lloyd George's Paris speech (12 November), in which he said that "when he saw the appalling casualty lists" he "wish(ed) it had not been necessary to win so many ("victories")", and unlike the Nivelle Affair, Lloyd George's differences with the generals were being aired in public for the first time. The ''Daily News'', ''Star'' and ''Globe'' attacked Lloyd George.&lt;ref name="Jeffery 2006, pp 207-8"&gt;Jeffery 2006, pp 207–8&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Woodward, 1998, pp192-4"&gt;Woodward, 1998, pp192-4&lt;/ref&gt;

Robertson reported to the War Cabinet (14 November) that Italy's situation was like that of [[Great Retreat (Russian)|Russia in 1915]] and that she might not recover. In his paper "Future Military Policy" (19 November), Robertson was impressed by the French Army's recovery under Petain but advised that lack of French reserves might make major French offensives in 1918 unlikely. He rejected a purely defensive posture in the west, as even defending would still result in heavy casualties, but was sceptical of Haig's wish to renew the Ypres Offensive in Spring 1918, and argued that Britain should build up her strength on the Western Front and then decide on the scale of her 1918 offensives. He warned (correctly) that, with Russia dropping out of the war, the Germans would use the opportunity to attack in 1918 before the [[American Expeditionary Forces|American Expeditionary Force]] were present in strength. Lloyd George replied (wrongly) that the Germans would not attack and would fail if they did.&lt;ref&gt;Woodward, 1998, pp173-4, 178&lt;/ref&gt;

Amid talk of [[Austen Chamberlain]] withdrawing support from the government, Robertson briefed the Opposition Leader [[H.H. Asquith|Asquith]]. However, Lloyd George survived the Commons debate on Rapallo (19 November) by praising the generals and claiming that the aim of the Supreme War Council was purely to "coordinate" policy.&lt;ref name="Jeffery 2006, pp 207-8"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Woodward, 1998, pp192-4"/&gt;

===SWC and Inter-Allied Reserve===
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 104-0941A, Bei Cambrai, zerstörter englischer Panzer Mark I.jpg|thumb|right|300px|A scene from the Battle of Cambrai]]
Derby got the Prime Minister to agree that Robertson should accompany Wilson (British Military Representative) to all Supreme War Council meetings and he would make no proposals until Robertson and the War Council had had a chance to vet them. He then reneged on this promise, telling Derby (26 November) that Robertson would have a chance to comment at the meeting itself and that decisions would have to ratified by the War Cabinet after they had been made. Lloyd George restored Wilson's freedom of action by instructing Wilson to send his reports directly to him.&lt;ref name="Woodward, 1998, pp192-4"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Jeffery 2006, pp 210-11"&gt;Jeffery 2006, pp 210–11&lt;/ref&gt;

Hankey wrote (26 November) that only Britain, the USA and Germany were likely to last until 1919 and that "on the whole the balance of advantage lies with us, provided we do not exhaust ourselves prematurely".&lt;ref&gt;Woodward, 1998, pp173-4&lt;/ref&gt;

By the time of the initial SWC meeting (Versailles 1 December 1917) [[Edmund Allenby, 1st Viscount Allenby|Allenby]]'s successes, culminating in the [[Battle of Jerusalem (1917)|Fall of Jerusalem]] (9 December 1917), demonstrated the potential of attacks in the Middle East, particularly compared to Haig's apparently unproductive offensive at [[Battle of Passchendaele|Ypres]], followed by [[Battle of Cambrai (1917)|Cambrai]] in November (initial success followed by retaking of gains). Russia had finally collapsed (Brest Litovsk Armistice 16 December) yet only a handful of American divisions were available so far in the west.&lt;ref name="Jeffery 2006, pp 210-11"/&gt;

After the Fall of Jerusalem Derby threatened to resign if Lloyd George sacked Robertson, but the War Cabinet (11–12 December) minuted its dissatisfaction at the information which he had given them about Palestine. Maurice claimed that intelligence from Syria "was too stale to be of use" and Robertson claimed that the speed of Allenby's advance, often with little water, had taken everyone by surprise.&lt;ref&gt;Woodward, 1998, pp163&lt;/ref&gt;

After the Fall of Jerusalem, Allenby irritated Robertson by writing that he could conquer the rest of Palestine with his present force of 6–8 divisions, but said he would need 16–18 divisions for a further advance of 250 miles to Aleppo (the Damascus-Beirut Line) to cut Turkish communications to Mesopotamia. In a paper of 26 December, Robertson claimed that the conquest of the remainder of Palestine might mean an extra 57,000 battle casualties and 20,000 sick. Amery (30 December) thought this "an amazing document even from him" and that such arguments could have been produced against any major campaign in history. By mid-January Amery and Lloyd George were arranging for the Permanent Military Representatives at Versailles to discuss Palestine (they thought Turkish ration strength was 250,000 "at most" whereas the General Staff put it at 425,000, of whom around half were combatants).&lt;ref&gt;Woodward, 1998, pp164&lt;/ref&gt;

Robertson tried to control Lt Gen Sir [[William Marshall (British Army officer)|William Raine Marshall]] (Maude's replacement as C-in-C Mesopotamia) by handpicking his staff. Smuts was sent to Egypt to confer with Allenby and Marshall and prepare for major efforts in that theatre. Before his departure, alienated by Robertson's cooking of the figures, he urged Robertson's removal. Allenby told Smuts of Robertson's private instructions (sent by hand of Walter Kirke, appointed by Robertson as Smuts' adviser) that there was no merit in any further advance and worked with Smuts to draw up plans for further advances in Palestine.&lt;ref&gt;Woodward, 1998, pp165-8&lt;/ref&gt;

Wilson wanted Robertson reduced "from the position of a Master to that of a servant". Robertson thought Wilson's SWC Joint Note 12, which predicted that neither side could win a decisive victory on the Western Front in 1918, and that decisive results could be had against Turkey, "d-----d rot in general" and promised Haig he would "stick to (his) guns and clear out if (he was) overruled". Joint Note 12 and Note 14 proposing the formation of a General Reserve were discussed at the second full session of the SWC (30 January – 2 February 1918): Robertson opposed attacks on Turkey, (1 Feb) siding openly with Clemenceau against Lloyd George. Although Robertson apologised for doing so, the Prime Minister was angry and told Wilson afterwards that he would have to get rid of Robertson. Robertson's request to be on the Executive Board controlling the planned Allied General Reserve was overruled.&lt;ref&gt;Jeffery 2006, pp 192–4, 212–5&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Woodward, 1998, pp165-7&lt;/ref&gt;

Robertson called the Executive War Board the "Versailles Soviet" and claimed to the King's adviser [[Arthur Bigge, 1st Baron Stamfordham|Lord Stamfordham]] that having "practically, two CIGSs" would lead to "destruction of confidence among the troops". He also briefed Gwynne against the proposals, writing that "[[David Lloyd George|the little man]]" was "all out for (his) blood" and "to see that the fine British Army is not placed at the mercy of irresponsible people – &amp; some of them foreigners at that".&lt;ref name="Jeffery 2006, pp 217"&gt;Jeffery 2006, pp 217&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fall from power===
Robertson was finally forced out in February 1918 over his refusal to agree that the British representative at the Supreme War Council at Versailles should be Deputy CIGS and a member of the Army Council (giving him the right to issue orders to the BEF).&lt;ref name=ODNB/&gt; He distrusted the dual chain of command set up by the War Cabinet, he wanted civilians to stay out of military decision-making.&lt;ref name=robertson335&gt;Robertson 1921, pp. 335–336&lt;/ref&gt;  Lloyd George offered Robertson a choice of remaining as CIGS in London with reduced powers (reporting to the Secretary of State for War rather than directly to the War Cabinet), or else accepting the Versailles job.&lt;ref name=ODNB/&gt; Robertson's position was that either the CIGS should himself be the Versailles delegate or else the Versailles representative should be clearly subordinate to the CIGS.&lt;ref name=ODNB/&gt; There was talk of the government falling, and Lloyd George attempted to have Robertson swap jobs with Plumer, then commanding British troops in Italy (Plumer refused).&lt;ref name=ODNB/&gt;&lt;ref name="Jeffery 2006, pp 217"/&gt;

Haig was summoned to London to be consulted; while driving from Victoria Station to 10 Downing Street "by a circuitous route" Derby, who had threatened to resign in protest, told him (9 Feb) Robertson "had lately become most difficult to deal with and lost his temper quickly". Haig, whose relations with Robertson had been deteriorating since at least the Boulogne Conference of September 1917, told Robertson (11 Feb) it was his duty to go to Versailles or anywhere else the government wanted, and advised the King to insist on Robertson going to Versailles. Derby (in Beaverbrook's phrase "left stranded like a whale on a sandbank") withdrew his resignation, which Lloyd George permitted on condition he did not resign again.&lt;ref name="Reid 2006, pp421-2"&gt;Reid 2006, pp421-2&lt;/ref&gt;

Four days of argument, 11 February 1918 through to 14 February 1918, now ensued between Robertson and the War Cabinet.&lt;ref name="robertson335"/&gt; The King thought it would be "a national calamity" if Robertson was removed but when told of this Lloyd George told Stamfordham that "he did not share the King's extremely favourable opinion" of Robertson "who had never fought at the Front, had hardly ever visited the trenches, and who was not known by the rank and file" and that the government would resign if the King attempted to block Robertson's removal. [[George Curzon, 1st Marquess Curzon of Kedleston|Curzon]] and [[Arthur Balfour|Balfour]] were sympathetic to Robertson's position that the Versailles delegate must report to the CIGS, but he lost Balfour's sympathy at a Cabinet meeting on 14 February where he made clear his dislike of Wilson. He had told Stamfordham that he would serve at Versailles under Plumer as CIGS, but not under Wilson "his Junior".&lt;ref name=ODNB/&gt;&lt;ref name="Jeffery 2006, pp 218"&gt;Jeffery 2006, pp 218&lt;/ref&gt;

As part of Lloyd George's power struggle with Robertson and his press supporters, on 16 February the prominent journalists [[Howell Arthur Gwynne|Gwynne]] and [[Charles à Court Repington|Repington]] appeared at [[Bow Street Magistrates' Court]] charged with having contravened [[Defence of the Realm Act 1914|DORA]] Regulation 18 by printing articles discussing the conflict between Versailles and the War Office, Lloyd George's plans to concentrate efforts against Turkey, and the failure to keep the Army up to strength. Robertson's wife was in the crowd, as were his colleagues [[George Macdonogh|Macdonogh]] and [[Frederick Barton Maurice|Maurice]]. Repington later claimed that Robertson had told him that he could no more afford to be seen with him than either of them "could afford to be seen walking down Regent Street with a whore".&lt;ref&gt;Bonham-Carter 1963, p352-3&lt;/ref&gt;

After a fortnight of argument Robertson's "resignation" was announced.&lt;ref name=ODNB/&gt; Lloyd George, possibly aware that Robertson was dependent on his army pay, suggested he be given command of an Army in France, but Haig said he "was quite unfitted to command troops".&lt;ref name="Jeffery 2006, pp 218"&gt;Jeffery 2006, pp 218&lt;/ref&gt; Robertson wrote notes thanking [[Frederick Barton Maurice|Maurice]], [[George Macdonogh|Macdonogh]] and [[Robert Whigham|Whigham]], ending "now get on with the war".&lt;ref&gt;Woodward, 1998, pp205&lt;/ref&gt; Wilson and Robertson had a very brief handover meeting at the War Office, at which Robertson (by Wilson's account) was "grumpy and ungracious &amp; said he had nothing to say – and indeed said nothing".&lt;ref name="Jeffery 2006, pp 218"/&gt; Wilson later recalled (in his last letter as CIGS, to Rawlinson (13 Feb 1922)) that he "walked out without handing me over anything in particular; there was indeed a box of matches in the top right-hand drawer and some feathers for pipe-cleaning, or the remains of some of the Staff".&lt;ref&gt;Jeffery 1985, p. 336&lt;/ref&gt;

===After CIGS: the Maurice Affair===
Robertson was appointed [[General Officer Commanding]]-in-Chief of [[Eastern Command (United Kingdom)|Eastern Command]] in February 1918. He would hold this post for four months.&lt;ref name=robertson335/&gt;&lt;ref name="Woodward, 1998, pp207-10"&gt;Woodward, 1998, pp207-10&lt;/ref&gt;

After the German "Michael" Offensive, the press (8–9 April) blamed Lloyd George for starving the army of men, with the ''Morning Post'' and ''Daily News'' mentioning that it happened just after Robertson's removal while the ''Star'' called for Robertson to be appointed Secretary of State for War. The ''Star'' later blamed the Versailles machinery for forcing a depleted Fifth Army to take over more front, while the ''Globe'' and ''Morning Post'' called for Robertson's restoration as CIGS. Lloyd George was amenable to Haig's suggestion that Robertson be appointed Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the BEF, but Robertson wrote to Haig (19 April) "my job is CIGS or nothing". Repington in the ''Morning Post'' (20 and 22 April) called this suggestion "a pretext for getting him out of the way of the imbeciles" in London and called for Lloyd George's removal as Prime Minister.&lt;ref name="Woodward, 1998, pp207-10"/&gt;

On 29 April Robertson met with his former assistant [[Frederick Barton Maurice|Maj-Gen Maurice]] to discuss concerns, which Maurice had heard being discussed at Haig's GHQ on 15 April, that Lloyd George had misled the House of Commons on 9 April about the weakness of the BEF prior to the [[Operation Michael|German "Michael" Offensive]]. From the context (letters from Robertson 29 and 30 April) it is clear that Robertson suggested that he write to Henry Wilson and then, if necessary to the press. Robertson initially suggested he speak to Asquith, Leader of the Opposition, but Maurice did not do so (in John Grigg's view Asquith probably would have advised against going to the press), and Robertson changed his mind later the same day.&lt;ref&gt;Grigg 2002, p492&lt;/ref&gt; Maurice composed his letter on 2 May but did not yet send it. Robertson wrote to him on 4 May, writing that not too much credence should be given to imminent predictions of Lloyd George's downfall, that Maurice should take especial care to get his facts exactly right, and adding: "You are contemplating a great thing – to your undying credit".&lt;ref&gt;Grigg 2002, p493&lt;/ref&gt;

The Maurice letter, a blatant breach of King's Regulations, appeared in several newspapers on 7 May. Maurice denied that it was a military conspiracy to overthrow a civilian government, and claimed "it ha(d) been seen by no soldier" (omitting to mention that Robertson had praised and encouraged him). Lloyd George later claimed in his memoirs that Robertson had been aiming to topple the government and become a military dictator like [[Paul von Hindenburg|Hindenburg]], claims which were believed by [[Max Aitken, 1st Baron Beaverbrook|Beaverbrook]]. However, although journalists like Gwynne and [[Ivor Maxse|Maxse]] sometimes dropped such hints, there is no evidence that this was Robertson's intention. Robertson thought Lloyd George would survive the crisis, although he may have hoped to be restored as CIGS.&lt;ref name="Reid 2006, pp421-2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Woodward, 1998, pp207-10"/&gt;

Hankey recorded (8 May) rumours, seemingly being repeated by Lloyd George, that Robertson was plotting with [[H.H. Asquith|Asquith]], [[Hugh Trenchard, 1st Viscount Trenchard|Trenchard]] (recently resigned as [[Chief of the Air Staff (United Kingdom)|Chief of Air Staff]]), Repington, Gwynne, Maurice and [[John Jellicoe, 1st Earl Jellicoe|Jellicoe]] (recently sacked as [[First Sea Lord]]), although the rumours also said that Robertson refused to openly associate with the Maurice Letter. Robertson wrote to Lord Milner (Secretary of State for War) denying that he had been involved in such conspiracies. Lloyd George survived the [[Maurice Debate]] (9 May).&lt;ref name="Bonham-Carter 1963, p374"&gt;Bonham-Carter 1963, p374&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Woodward, 1998, pp210&lt;/ref&gt;

Robertson was promoted to [[Commander-in-Chief, Home Forces|General Officer Commanding-in-Chief for Home Forces]] in June 1918.&lt;ref name=ODNB/&gt; He visited each regional command, and took a special interest in the air defence of London, correctly predicting that the bombing of civilians would play an ever greater role in future wars.&lt;ref name="Bonham-Carter 1963, p374"/&gt;

Haig had gradually established a warily respectful relationship with Wilson, with whom he was on first-name terms, which he never had been with Robertson.&lt;ref&gt;Sheffield 2011, p.264-5&lt;/ref&gt; (A letter to Haig on 16 February 1918, shortly before his resignation, is the only known occasion on which Robertson addressed Haig by his first name.&lt;ref&gt;Bonham-Carter 1963, p349&lt;/ref&gt;) After the war Haig paid tribute at a dinner to Wilson, but not to Robertson, who was present. Robertson left remarking he would "never go farting with 'Aig again".&lt;ref&gt;Jeffery 2006, pp 227–8&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post-war==
[[File:Memorial to Field Marshal Sir William Robertson - geograph.org.uk - 1062709.jpg|thumb|Memorial in St Chad's church, [[Welbourn]]]]
Robertson became Commander-in-Chief of the [[British Army of the Rhine]] in April 1919.&lt;ref name=ODNB /&gt; It was at a tennis-party at his house in Cologne that the young Captain [[Bernard Montgomery, 1st Viscount Montgomery of Alamein|Montgomery]] persuaded him to add his name to the list of officers selected for Staff College, which would be his only hope of ever achieving high command.&lt;ref&gt;The Memoirs of Field-Marshal the Viscount Montgomery of Alamein, K.G.&lt;/ref&gt; In late June 1919 it briefly appeared that Germany might refuse to sign the [[Treaty of Versailles|Versailles Treaty]]. Units – consisting largely of young and inexperienced soldiers as war veterans had been given priority for demobilisation – had to be concentrated to advance further into Germany and be prepared for irregular warfare, but the crisis passed.&lt;ref&gt;Bonham-Carter 1963, p376&lt;/ref&gt;

Robertson was appointed a [[Knight Grand Cross of the Order of St Michael and St George]] in the [[Queen's Birthday Honours|King's Birthday Honours]] in June 1919.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=31395|page=7425|date=6 June 1919 |nolink=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was not invited to the peace celebration on 19 July 1919.&lt;ref name="Bonham-Carter 1963, p377"&gt;Bonham-Carter 1963, p377&lt;/ref&gt; He was thanked by Parliament, granted £10,000 (the same amount as Wilson, Birdwood or Trenchard; the capital was held in trust and only the income made available) and created a [[Baronet]], of Beaconsfield in the County of Buckingham on 29 December 1919.&lt;ref name="Bonham-Carter 1963, p377"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=31708|page=15988|date=30 December 1919 |nolink=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the War he was also awarded the Belgian [[War Cross (Belgium)|War Cross]],&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=30568 |supp=y|page=3094|date=8 March 1918 |nolink=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Grand Cross of the Serbian [[Order of the White Eagle (Serbia)|Order of the White Eagle]] (with Swords)&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=30891 |supp=y|page=10645|date=6 September 1918 |nolink=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Distinguished Service Medal (U.S. Army)|American Distinguished Service Medal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=31451 |supp=y|page=8937|date=11 July 1919 |nolink=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was as well as being appointed to the Chinese [[Order of the Precious Brilliant Golden Grain|Order of Chia-Ho]] (1st Class),&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=31783 |supp=y|page=1935|date=13 February 1920 |nolink=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; being given the Grand Cross of the [[Order of the Crown of Italy]],&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=31812 |supp=y|page=2871|date=5 March 1920 |nolink=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; being appointed to the Russian [[Order of Alexander Nevsky]]&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=31890 |supp=y|page=5230|date=4 May 1920 |nolink=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; and receiving the Japanese Grand Cordon of the [[Order of the Rising Sun]].&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=31002 |supp=y|page=13276|date=8 November 1918 |nolink=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Troop reductions meant that the Rhine Command was being downgraded to a lieutenant-general's command, so in July 1919 Churchill offered Robertson the Irish Command, often a last posting for distinguished generals nearing retirement. Although the level of violence in Ireland in 1919 was not yet as high as it would be in 1920–21, there were concerns that Robertson lacked the subtlety for the job. In October the CIGS [[Henry Hughes Wilson|Henry Wilson]] warned Churchill that the planned introduction of [[Government of Ireland Act 1920|Irish Home Rule]] that autumn would lead to unrest, and asked him to consult the Prime Minister, perhaps in the knowledge that Lloyd George disliked Robertson. Lloyd George suggested that Robertson be appointed [[Commander-in-Chief, India]], but this job was already earmarked for [[Henry Rawlinson, 1st Baron Rawlinson|Rawlinson]]. Lloyd George preferred [[Nevil Macready|Macready]] for the Irish job, as he had experience of peacekeeping duties in South Wales and Belfast as well as having served as Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police in London. Churchill again told the Prime Minister in February 1920 that he wanted Robertson, then protested that he had been overruled. He promoted Robertson to [[Field marshal (United Kingdom)|field marshal]] "as a consolation prize" on 29 March 1920,&lt;ref&gt;Jeffery 2006, p260-1&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=31862 |supp=y|page=4411|date=13 April 1920 |nolink=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; making him the only man ever to rise in the British army from private to field marshal.&lt;ref name=ODNB /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britain-at-war-magazine.com/news/from-private-to-field-marshal|title=From Private to Field Marshal|last=Lethbridge|first=JP|work=Britain at War Magazine|publisher=Green Arbor Publishing|accessdate=13 June 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110519215249/http://www.britain-at-war-magazine.com/news/from-private-to-field-marshal|archivedate=19 May 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;the promotion was to fill a vacancy left by the recent death of [[Evelyn Wood (British Army officer)|Sir Evelyn Wood]] (Bonham-Carter 1963, p377)&lt;/ref&gt; Wilson thought the promotion "very disgusting".&lt;ref&gt;Holmes 2004 p. 355-8&lt;/ref&gt;

On returning to the UK Robertson received no official welcome at Victoria Station and later recorded that "having secured a broken-down taxi I drove to my residence in Eccleston Square; and thereupon joined the long list of unemployed officers on half-pay".&lt;ref&gt;Woodward, 1998, pp213&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later life==
[[File:William Robert Robertson Grave Brookwood.jpg|thumb|right|Robertson's grave in [[Brookwood Cemetery]]]]
Robertson was colonel of the [[Royal Scots Greys|2nd Dragoons (Royal Scots Greys)]] from 9 March 1916&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=29523|page=3292|date=28 March 1916 |nolink=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; and colonel of the [[3rd Carabiniers|3rd/6th Dragoon Guards]] from 31 December 1925.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=33131|page=984|date=9 February 1926 |nolink=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; He became Colonel of the [[Royal Horse Guards]] in 1928;&lt;ref name=page253&gt;Heathcote, p. 253&lt;/ref&gt; this made him [[Gold Stick and Silver Stick|Gold Stick]] and a member of the Royal Household.&lt;ref name="Bonham-Carter 1963, p379-81"&gt;Bonham-Carter 1963, p379-81&lt;/ref&gt; He was advanced to [[Knight Grand Cross of the Royal Victorian Order]] in 1931.&lt;ref name=ODNB /&gt;

On retirement Robertson's life savings had been a mere £600 (just over £20,000 at 2014 prices). He became chairman of the Brewers' Trustees and a director of [[British Dyestuffs Corporation]] as well as President of the [[Royal British Legion|British Legion]]. He became a director of the British Palestine Corporation and of the [[London General Omnibus Company]] – forty years later he was still remembered for his efforts on behalf of the men's welfare. Despite having made gifts to members of his family, on his death he left a modest fortune of £49,000 (almost £3,000,000 at 2014 prices).&lt;ref name=ODNB /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bonham-Carter 1963, p379-81"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.measuringworth.com/ukcompare/result.php Compute the Relative Value of a U.K. Pound] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160331194822/https://measuringworth.com/ukcompare/result.php |date=31 March 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although not a pacifist, in his later years Robertson often spoke out against the cost – both financial and human – of war.&lt;ref name="Bonham-Carter 1963, p379-81"/&gt; His interests were [[fishing]], [[shooting]] and [[golf]].&lt;ref name=ODNB /&gt; Early in 1933 he told [[James Edward Edmonds|Edmonds]] that his chief regret was that he had never had a command in the field.&lt;ref&gt;Bonham-Carter 1963, p382&lt;/ref&gt; He died from a [[thrombosis]] on 12 February 1933, aged 73.&lt;ref name=ODNB/&gt; [[Mount Robertson]] in the [[Canadian Rockies]]&lt;ref&gt;{{BCGNIS|20770|Robertson, Mount}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Sir William Robertson Academy|Sir William Robertson High School]] in his birth village, [[Welbourn]], were named after him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.swrhs.org/|title=Welcome to our School|publisher=Sir William Robertson High School|accessdate=22 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He is buried in [[Brookwood Cemetery]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GmaPAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT181&amp;lpg=PT181&amp;dq=sir+william+robertson+brookwood&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=OtggNGfKsj&amp;sig=wuS0K7rUtvQChNPBdLlBPxw41xQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiC6ev6oPTPAhXCLcAKHQ5AB24Q6AEIMjAE#v=onepage&amp;q=sir%20william%20robertson%20brookwood&amp;f=false|title=London Cemeteries: An Illustrated Guide &amp; Gazetteer|first1= Hugh |last1=Meller|first2= Brian|last2= Parsons|publisher=History Press|year=2011|isbn=978-0752461830}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personality and assessments==
Robertson was a man of strong physique and physical presence, admired by the King for his rise from humble origins. He had a prodigious memory and was very quick on the uptake, sometimes interrupting briefings with: "yes, I have got that, get on to the next point". However, although he could be amusing company off duty, as he rose the career ladder his brusque manner, possibly adopted to assert his authority, became more marked, even with superiors. "I've 'eard different" was a favourite retort to politicians who made military suggestions.&lt;ref&gt;Woodward 1998, pp. 2–3, 5–6.&lt;/ref&gt;

Churchill later wrote that Robertson "was an outstanding military personality. His vision as a strategist was not profound … he had no ideas of his own, but a sensible judgement negative in bias"&lt;ref&gt;Churchill 1938, p. 1261.&lt;/ref&gt; but he also commented that Robertson "had never himself at any time led even a troop in action, and whose war duties involved him in no more risk than many clerks".&lt;ref&gt;Churchill, Great Contemporaries, Chapter on Douglas Haig, p.222.&lt;/ref&gt; Hankey wrote that "he knew what he wanted and he nearly always got his own way".&lt;ref&gt;Woodward 1998, pp. 30–31.&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 1918 Foch told Derby that Robertson was "a far sounder man than [[Henry Hughes Wilson|Wilson]]" with a greater grasp of strategic detail, but less able to keep the British Cabinet on side.&lt;ref&gt;Jeffery 2006, p. 225.&lt;/ref&gt; Foch had earlier told [[Edward Spears|Spears]] "Robertson builds small, but he builds solid".&lt;ref&gt;Spears 1939, p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt;

Spears wrote that he was "an overwhelming personality ... very intolerant of () ignorance ... arrogant, aitchless when excited, and flat-footed (both figuratively and physically) ... an ambulating refrigerator ... when speaking of (any minister) he generally closed the sentence by making the gesture of a governess rapping the knuckles of a child fiddling with things on the table ... a great man, probably the best and finest soldier we produced in the war ... his manners were not good ... for the sake of standing by Haig he probably put aside and overrode many ideas of his own ... (in his loyalty to Haig) he was ''plus royaliste que le roi''". His papers were "a monument of common sense and foresight". Spears' secretary was the daughter of [[Frederick Barton Maurice|Maurice]], whom he described as "Man Friday" to "this whale of a man, this soldier shipwrecked on the desert island of politics".&lt;ref&gt;Spears 1939, pp. 33–35.&lt;/ref&gt;

Maurice Hankey recorded that on a prewar committee which he had chaired Robertson, then Director of Military Training, had sat rudely with his back turned to him, until he had flattered him by seeking his advice privately. He wrote that "Perhaps his greatest quality … was "character". His was a dominating personality … (until) he had to give place to a more nimble and versatile mind (i.e. Wilson)".&lt;ref&gt;Bonham-Carter 1963, pp151-2&lt;/ref&gt;

Lloyd George (Memoirs Vol i. p467) accused Robertson of having "a profound and disturbing suspicion of all foreigners", but this is an exaggeration – with Britain and France allies for only the second time in their history, Robertson had played a leading role in instigating the Chantilly Conference at the end of 1915, and extended his hand to reach agreement with Nivelle in March 1917 and Petain in summer 1917.&lt;ref&gt;Woodward 1998, pp. 187–189.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lloyd George's biographer John Grigg is extremely critical of Robertson's behaviour during the Maurice Affair of May 1918. He comments that both Robertson and Maurice had time on their hands following their recent ousting and that men in such circumstances are apt to persuade themselves that great issues of principle are at stake. "In a remarkable, if flawed, career this was the ignoblest episode … Robertson's manipulative conduct [in encouraging Maurice to breach King's Regulations and destroy his own career] stands to his eternal discredit". Grigg believes that Robertson hoped to be reinstated as CIGS. Given Robertson's behaviour, Lloyd George's fears of a military plot to oust him were "not entirely fanciful".&lt;ref&gt;Grigg 2002, p492, 503, p511-2&lt;/ref&gt;

===Relations with Haig and other generals===
Robertson later wrote that "there was never, so far as I know, any material difference of opinion between (himself and Haig) in regard to the main principles to be observed in order to win the war".&lt;ref&gt;Robertson 1921, p. 248.&lt;/ref&gt;

David Woodward argues that, while his partnership with Haig was "arguably the most important partnership in British military history", which helped to ensure a massive British commitment to the Western Front, to some extent Robertson would have preferred more cautious attritional attacks rather than Haig's attempts at achieving deeper territorial objectives and possibly even breakthrough. Lloyd George claimed that Robertson was dominated by Haig, his senior in rank and social position; Woodward does not wholly accept this: although he did discourage Haig's promotion to field marshal while the Somme battle was still underway, in general Robertson simply thought it inappropriate to question Haig's plans while they were being carried out.&lt;ref name="Woodward, 1998, pp130-1"/&gt;

Cassar writes that Robertson was "blunt, graceless and prone to emotional outbursts when upset". "One can only speculate why someone as tough-minded and opinionated as Robertson would habitually defer to Haig. The reason, it would seem, was … because he was convinced that any split between the two would be exploited by the politicians to further their own agendas".&lt;ref&gt;Cassar 2011, 79&lt;/ref&gt;

Haig's diary does record that Robertson was hard to work with as he was not "a gentleman",&lt;ref&gt;Woodward, 1998, pp. xiii–xiv, 30–33.&lt;/ref&gt; and he wrote to his wife (30 May 1917) that he was "tactless" for wanting to come out to France during [[Battle of Messines (1917)|Messines]] "all for his own advertisement".&lt;ref name="Woodward, 1998, pp136-8"/&gt;

Robertson's rival Wilson appears to have held him in similar social disdain. Early in Robertson's tenure as Commandant at Staff College (20 December 1910), he did not speak to Wilson when he visited Staff College with the CIGS [[William Nicholson, 1st Baron Nicholson|Nicholson]], causing his predecessor to complain to Nicholson about his "most rude &amp; unpardonable behaviour". After Robertson had again not spoken to him at a Staff College point-to-point (25 March 1911), Wilson wrote that he was "an ill-mannered swine, though I don't think he means to be rude".&lt;ref&gt;Jeffery 2006, p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt; Wilson wrote (in 1915) "He is secretive &amp;, like all underbreds, suspicious; also his manners are somewhat repugnant" and that he was "a slippery old boy" and "It is d(amnable?) to work with a man who is not a gentleman. The moment the strain comes so does the hairy heel."&lt;ref&gt;Jeffery 2006, pp. 146–147.&lt;/ref&gt;

Robertson's lack of social graces was also remarked on by the staff officer [[Philip Howell]] (letter to his wife 10 April 1915) and, in 1933, by General [[John Humphrey Davidson|"Tavish" Davidson]] to Spears.&lt;ref&gt;Robbins 2005, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Relations with politicians===
Edmonds later argued in the Official History that Robertson had lost his position because of his bluntness and inability to get on with politicians. Woodward rejects this argument, arguing that although the government's failure to agree on clear war aims, other than defeating Germany, made his job much harder, ministers largely supported Robertson's commitment to the Western Front throughout 1916 and 1917, rather than Lloyd George's many schemes, until the manpower situation meant that a winding-down of that commitment was becoming inevitable (although in fact the war would take a different turn in 1918). Robertson himself noted in 1932 that Lloyd George's object (the "firework strategy" as he called it at the time) had been "to avoid fighting Germans" and that his survival as CIGS had often depended on Lloyd George's inability to persuade either the French or his ministerial colleagues to adopt his plans rather than Robertson's.&lt;ref&gt;Woodward 1998, pp. 37–38, 84–85, 183.&lt;/ref&gt;

Much ink has been spilled over Robertson's behaviour over Third Ypres, when he kept from the government both his disagreements with Haig (over the likelihood of territorial gains, Germany's nearness to defeat and the necessity for serious French participation) and, in mid-June, Lt-Col [[Edward Spears]]' reports on the extent of the French Mutiny. [[John Terraine|Terraine]], quoting [[Victor Bonham-Carter]], argued that by the second half of 1917 the distrust between Robertson and Lloyd George was such that he felt that, if he did not stand solid with Haig, Lloyd George would lose the war by transferring resources to other fronts.&lt;ref&gt;Terraine 1977, pp. 340–341.&lt;/ref&gt; Woodward describes Robertson's behaviour as "indefensible".&lt;ref name="Woodward, 1998, pp136-8"/&gt;

Hankey tried to institute weekly breakfasts between Lloyd George and Robertson, but these had failed as Lloyd George liked to sit talking for a long time after breakfast.&lt;ref&gt;Reid 2006, p. 423.&lt;/ref&gt; Although he cultivated a myth that he never read, Lloyd George was in fact a very early riser, who would have already have completed much of the day's paperwork before breakfast, and therefore preferred to do business at breakfast meetings rather than in the evening. [[Austen Chamberlain]] found the practice equally irritating.&lt;ref&gt;Grigg 2002, pp. 365–366.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family==
Late in 1894, after his return from Chitral, he married Mildred Palin, the daughter of Lt-Gen Charles Thomas Palin of the Indian Army. Her family did not approve of the match, and their first child, a son, died in infancy.&lt;ref name="Woodward, 1998, p2"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bonham-Carter 1963, p38-9&lt;/ref&gt;

They then had two daughters and two more sons.&lt;ref name=page251/&gt; His elder surviving son, [[Brian Robertson, 1st Baron Robertson of Oakridge|Brian Hubert]] (1896–1974), succeeded to the baronetcy, rose to become a general in the British Army and was raised to the peerage as Baron Robertson of Oakridge in 1961.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cracroftspeerage.co.uk/online/content/index1119.htm|title=Baron Robertson of Oakridge|publisher=Cracrofts Peerage|accessdate=22 January 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110131103844/http://www.cracroftspeerage.co.uk/online/content/index1119.htm|archivedate=31 January 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; His younger son John (1909–28) predeceased him, a tragedy which clouded his final years.&lt;ref name="Bonham-Carter 1963, p379-81"/&gt;

'''Terrance Gilbert Dillon''' (August 18, 1941 – May 28, 1964) was a [[defensive back]] in the [[National Football League]] (NFL). Dillon played with the [[Minnesota Vikings]] during the [[1963 NFL season]]. He had also been drafted in the 19th round of the [[1963 American Football League Draft]] by the [[Oakland Raiders]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/D/DillTe20.htm|title=Terry Dillon|publisher=Pro-Football=Reference.com|accessdate=May 31, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 28, 1964, Terry Dillon was working on a bridge construction project 25 miles west of Missoula when part of the temporary decking gave way and he fell 50 feet into the swift-running Clark Fork River.  Witnesses said Dillon, a strong swimmer, started swimming for shore, fighting the current, but disappeared after traveling about 200 yards.  His body was found on July 17th by a fisherman about 17 miles downstream from the bridge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oldestlivingprofootball.com/terrancegilbertdillon.htm|title=Terry Dillon|publisher=OldestLivingProFootballPlayers.com|accessdate=December 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1965, [[Minnesota Vikings]] [[linebacker]] [[Rip Hawkins]] received the first "Terry Dillon" award given by the Minnesota Vikings in honor of their late teammate.  The award symbolizes Dillon's qualities of dedication, self-sacrifice and ability.

'''''The Double Life of Veronique''''' ({{lang-fr|La double vie de Véronique}}, {{lang-pl|Podwójne życie Weroniki}}) is a 1991 French-Polish-Norwegian [[Drama (film and television)|drama film]] directed by [[Krzysztof Kieślowski]] and starring [[Irène Jacob]]. Written by Kieślowski and [[Krzysztof Piesiewicz]], the film explores the themes of identity, love, and human intuition through the characters of Weronika, a Polish choir soprano, and her double, Véronique, a French music teacher. The two women do not know each other, and yet they share a mysterious and emotional bond that transcends language and geography.

''The Double Life of Veronique'' is notable for [[Sławomir Idziak]]'s innovative cinematography and [[Zbigniew Preisner]]'s operatic score. The film was Kieślowski's first to be produced partly outside his native Poland.&lt;ref name="criterion"&gt;{{cite web|last= |first= |title=The Double Life of Véronique |publisher=''Criterion'' |url=http://www.criterion.com/films/214 |accessdate=11 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It won the [[Prize of the Ecumenical Jury]] and the [[FIPRESCI Prize]] at the [[1991 Cannes Film Festival]] for Krzysztof Kieslowski, and the [[Best Actress Award (Cannes Film Festival)|Best Actress Award]] for Irène Jacob.&lt;ref name="cannes"&gt;{{cite web|last= |first= |title=La Double vie de Veronique |publisher=''Festival de Cannes'' |url=http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/83/year/1991.html |accessdate=11 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Double Life of Veronique'' was selected as the Polish entry for the [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film|Best Foreign Language Film]] at the [[64th Academy Awards]], but was not accepted as a nominee.&lt;ref&gt;Margaret Herrick Library, Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
In Poland in 1968, a little girl is shown the stars in the winter sky by her mother, who identifies the Christmas Eve star. In France, a little girl is shown one of the first leaves of spring by her mother, who points out the fine veins running through.

In Poland in 1990, a young Polish woman named Weronika ([[Irène Jacob]]) is singing at an outdoor concert with her choir when a sudden downpour causes the singers to rush for cover. After Weronika holds the last note alone, she meets her boyfriend, Antek (Jerzy Gudejko), and they go to his apartment to have sex. The next day she asks her father to tell Antek she is leaving to be with her sick aunt in Kraków. She tells him that lately she feels she's not alone in the world.

Weronika travels to Kraków by train looking out at the passing landscape through a small clear rubber ball. At her aunt's house, Weronika talks about her boyfriend, then meets a friend at a concert rehearsal. As the choir rehearses, Weronika, who is watching offstage, accompanies them in her soprano voice. Afterwards, the musical director asks her to audition. Overjoyed, Weronika rushes home with the sheet music. On the way, she passes through Main Market Square, where a protest rally is in progress. One protester runs into her, causing her to drop her music folder. After retrieving the sheet music, Weronika notices a French tourist taking photos of the protestors—a young woman who looks exactly like her. Weronika smiles as she watches her double board the tourist bus that soon pulls away.

At the audition, Weronika's singing impresses the musical director and conductor, and she is later told that she won the audition. The next day, while on a trolley studying the score, Weronika notices her boyfriend Antek following on his motorbike. When they talk, she apologizes for not returning his calls, and Antek tells her he loves her. Later, while getting dressed for the concert, Weronika presses her face against a window and sees an old woman with shopping bags slowly making her way along the street. That night during the concert, while singing a solo part, Weronika collapses onstage and dies.

In Paris that day, a young French woman named Véronique (Irène Jacob), after sex with her former boyfriend, is overwhelmed with sadness, as if she were grieving. The next day, at the school where she teaches music, Véronique attends a marionette performance with her class about a ballet dancer who breaks her leg and then turns into a butterfly. She then leads her class in a musical piece by an eighteenth-century composer, Van den Budenmayer—the same piece performed by Weronika when she died. That night while driving home, she sees the puppeteer at a traffic light motioning to her not to light the wrong end of her cigarette. Later she is awakened by a phone call with no one speaking, but in the background she hears a choir singing the music of Van den Budenmayer. The next day, Véronique drives to her father's house where she reveals she is in love with someone she doesn't know, and that recently she felt she was alone—that someone was gone from her life. Back in Paris, she receives a letter containing a shoelace, which she compares to her [[EKG]] graph, and a stranger shines light on her using a mirror.

Véronique learns that the puppeteer is a children's book author named Alexandre Fabbri ([[Philippe Volter]]), whose marionette story was based on his book ''Libellule &amp; Papillon''. One of his other books is about a shoelace. In the coming days, Véronique reads several of Alexandre's books. When Véronique visits her father, he gives her a package addressed to her containing a cassette tape. When she's alone, she listens to the mysterious recording of a typewriter, footsteps, a door opening, a train station, and a fragment of music by Van den Budenmayer. There are also sounds of a car accident and explosion. The postage stamp on the envelope leads Véronique to a [[Gare Saint-Lazare]] train station cafe where she believes the cassette recording was made. There she sees Alexandre sitting by himself, as if waiting for her. He tells her he's been waiting for her for two days, that he's working on a new book, and that this was a kind of experiment to see if she would come to him. Angered at being manipulated, Véronique leaves and takes a taxi to a nearby hotel, After checking in, she sees Alexandre, who apparently ran after the taxi. He asks for her forgiveness, and she brings him up to her room, where they both fall asleep. During the night, he confesses his love for her and they become sexual partners.

The next morning she tells him, "All my life I've felt like I was here and somewhere else at the same time." While looking at a proof sheet of photos taken on Véronique's recent trip to Poland, Alexandre notices what he thinks is a photo of Véronique, but she assures him it is not her, that she in fact took the photo—of a young Polish woman carrying a music folder. Later at his apartment, Véronique sees Alexandre working on a new marionette with her image. When asked about the purpose of a second identical marionette, Alexandre explains, "I handle them a lot when I perform. They get damaged easily." He shows her how to work the one marionette while the double lies lifeless on the table.

Some time later, Alexandre reads his new book to Véronique about two women, born the same day in different cities, who have a mysterious connection. Later that day, Véronique arrives at her father's house, stops at the front gate, and reaches out and touches an old tree. Her father, who is inside the house, seems to sense this without seeing it.

==Production==
===Filming style===
The film has a strong fantasy element, though the supernatural aspect of the story is never explained. Like the later ''[[Three Colors: Blue]]'', it showcased Preisner's musical score as a major plot element, crediting his work to the fictional [[Van den Budenmayer]]. The [[cinematography]] is highly stylized, using color and camera filters to create an ethereal atmosphere; the cinematographer, [[Sławomir Idziak]], had previously experimented with these techniques in one episode of ''[[Dekalog]]'', and Kieślowski would later use color for a wider range of effects in his ''[[Three Colors|Three Colors trilogy]]''. Kieślowski had earlier used the idea of exploring different paths in life for the same person, in his Polish film ''Przypadek'' (''Blind Chance''), and the central choice faced by Weronika/Véronique is based on a brief subplot in the ninth episode of ''Dekalog''.

===Filming locations===
The film was shot at locations including [[Clermont-Ferrand]], [[Kraków]] and [[Paris]].&lt;ref name="imdblocations"&gt;{{cite web|last= |first= |title=Filming locations for The Double Life of Veronique |publisher=''Internet Movie Database'' |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0101765/locations |accessdate=11 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Alternative ending===
A [[Criterion Collection]] region 1 DVD was released in November 2006 in the United States and Canada, which includes an alternative ending which Kieślowski shot at the request of [[Harvey Weinstein]] of Miramax for the American release.  Kieślowski added four brief shots to the end of the film showing Véronique's father emerging from the house and Véronique running across the yard to embrace him. The final image of the father and daughter embracing is shot from inside the house through a window.

==Music==
The film was scored by Zbigniew Preisner.  In the film his music is described as being by Van den Budenmayer, a fictitious eighteenth-century Dutch composer created by Preisner and Kieślowski for attributions in screenplays. Music "by" the Dutch composer plays a role in two other Kieślowski films: ''Dekalog'' (1988), and ''Three Colors: Blue'' (1993) in which a theme from his ''musique funebres'' is quoted in the ''Song for the Unification of Europe''. Its E minor soprano solo is prefigured in Weronika's final performance.&lt;ref name="musicolog"&gt;{{cite web|last= |first= |title=Zbigniew Preisner |publisher=''Musicolog'' |date= |url=http://www.musicolog.com/preisner.asp |accessdate=12 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Puppetry==
The puppet acts in ''The Double Life of Veronique'' were performed by American puppeteer and sculptor [[Bruce Schwartz]]. Unlike most puppeteers who usually hide their hands in gloves or use strings or sticks, Schwartz shows his hands while performing.

==Reception==
===Critical response===
''The Double Life of Veronique'' received mostly positive reviews. In her review in ''Not Coming to a Theater Near You'', Jenny Jediny wrote, "In many ways, ''The Double Life of Veronique'' is a small miracle of cinema; ... Kieslowski’s strong, if largely post-mortem reputation among the art house audience has elevated a film that makes little to no sense on paper, while its emotional tone strikes a singular—perhaps perfect—key."&lt;ref name="not"&gt;{{cite web|last=Jediny |first=Jenny |title=The Double Life of Véronique |publisher=''Not Coming to a Theater Near You'' |url=http://www.notcoming.com/reviews/2xveronique/ |accessdate=11 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his review in ''The Washington Post'', Hal Hinson called the film "a mesmerizing poetic work composed in an eerie minor key." Noting that the effect on the viewer is subtle but very real, Hinson concluded, "The film takes us completely into its world, and in doing so, it leaves us with the impression that our own world, once we return to it, is far richer and portentous than we had imagined." Hinson was particularly impressed with Jacob's performance:
{{quote|This is an actress with an uncanny openness and vulnerability to the camera. She's beautiful, but in a completely unconventional way, and she has such changeable features that our interest is never exhausted. What's remarkable about her performance is how quiet it is; as an actress, she seems to work almost off the decibel scale. And yet she is remarkably alive on screen, remarkably present. She's a rare combination—a sexy yet soulful actress.&lt;ref name="washingtonpost"&gt;{{cite news|last=Hinson |first=Hal |title=The Double Life of Véronique |publisher=''The Washington Post'' |date=13 December 1991 |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/style/longterm/movies/videos/thedoublelifeofveroniquenrhinson_a0a726.htm |accessdate=12 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

In her review in ''The New York Times'', Caryn James wrote, "''Veronique'' is poetic in the truest sense, relying on images that can't be turned into prosaic statements without losing something of their essence. The film suggests mysterious connections of personality and emotion, but it was never meant to yield any neat, summary idea about the two women's lives."&lt;ref name="nytimes"&gt;{{cite news|last=James |first=Caryn |title=The Double Life of Veronique (1991) |publisher=''The New York Times'' |date=8 December 1991 |url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/14460/The-Double-Life-of-Veronique/overview |accessdate=11 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his review in the ''Chicago Sun-Times'', Roger Ebert wrote, "The movie has a hypnotic effect. We are drawn into the character, not kept at arm's length with a plot." Ebert singled out Sławomir Idziak's innovative use of color and cinematography:
{{quote|This is one of the most beautiful films I've seen. The cinematographer, Slawomir Idziak, finds a glow in Irene Jacob's pre-Raphaelite beauty. He uses a rich palette, including insistent reds and greens that don't "stand" for anything but have the effect of underlining the other colors. The other color, blending with both, is golden yellow, and then there are the skin tones. Jacob, who was 24 when the film was made, has a flawless complexion that the camera lingers near to. Her face is a template waiting for experience to be added.&lt;ref name="ebert"&gt;{{cite news|last=Ebert |first=Roger |title=The Double Life of Veronique (1991) |publisher=''Chicago Sun-Times'' |date=25 February  2009 |url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20090225/REVIEWS08/902259993/1004 |accessdate=11 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
In 2009 Ebert added ''The Double Life of Veronique'' to his Great Movies list. Krzysztof Kieślowski's ''Dekalog'' and ''The Three Colors Trilogy'' are also on the list.&lt;ref name="ebertlist"&gt;{{cite web|last=Ebert |first=Roger |title=Great Movies |publisher=''Chicago Sun-Times'' |url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/section?category=greatmovies_fulllist |accessdate=12 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his review for ''Empire Online'', David Parkinson called it "a film of great fragility and beauty, with the delicacy of the puppet theatre." He thought the film was "divinely photographed" by Slawomir Idziak, and praised Irène Jacob's performance as "simply sublime and thoroughly merited the Best Actress prize at Cannes." Parkinson saw the film as "compelling, challenging and irresistibly beautiful" and a "metaphysical masterpiece."&lt;ref name="empire"&gt;{{cite web|last=Parkinson |first=David |title=The Double Life of Veronique |publisher=''Empire Online'' |date= |url=http://www.empireonline.com/reviews/ReviewComplete.asp?FID=131948 |accessdate=12 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Film critic Marek Haltof sees the film as a political allegory in which Weronika represents Poland and Véronique France, or [[Western world|the West]]: both are highly cultured, but while Véronique is seemingly free to choose her destiny, Weronika's early death represents the sacrifice of Poland during the [[Second World War]] and its subsequent incorporation into the [[Soviet bloc]]; Véronique senses this loss without realizing what it is, and that she is incomplete without Weronika.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

At the ''All Movie'' web site, the film received a 4-star rating (out of 5) plus "High Artistic Quality" citation.&lt;ref name="allmovie"&gt;{{cite web|last=Reed |first=Anthony |title=The Double Life of Veronique |publisher=''Allmovie'' |url=http://www.allmovie.com/movie/the-double-life-of-veronique-v14460?r=allmovie |accessdate=11 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; At ''About.com'', which specializes in DVD reviews, the film received 5 stars (out of 5 in their critical review.&lt;ref name="about"&gt;{{cite web|last= |first= |title=DVD Pick: The Double Life of Veronique |publisher=''About.com'' |url=http://homevideo.about.com/od/dvdrevie2/fr/DoubleLifeDVDVa.htm |accessdate=11 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; At ''BBC'', the film received 3 stars (out of 5).&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;{{cite news|last=Leyland |first=Matthew |title=The Double Life Of Véronique (La Double Vie De Véronique) (1991) |publisher=''BBC'' |date=12 March 2006 |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/films/2006/03/13/the_double_life_of_veronique_2006_review.shtml |accessdate=11 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, on the aggregate reviewer web site ''Rotten Tomatoes'', the film received an 85% positive rating from critics based on 26 reviews.&lt;ref name="rotten"&gt;{{cite web|last= |first= |title=La Double Vie de Véronique (The Double Life of Veronique) (1991) |publisher=''Rotten Tomatoes'' |url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/double_life_of_veronique/ |accessdate=11 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Box office performance===

'''''The Wandering Jew''''' ({{lang-fr|link=no|'''Le Juif errant'''}}) is an 1844 novel by the French writer [[Eugène Sue]].

==Plot==
The story is entitled ''The Wandering Jew'', but the figure of the Wandering Jew himself plays a minimal role.  The [[prologue]] of the text describes two figures who cry out to each other across the [[Bering Straits]].  One is the Wandering Jew, the other his sister, [[Herodias|Hérodiade]].  The Wandering Jew also represents the [[cholera]] epidemic— wherever he goes, cholera follows in his wake.&lt;ref&gt;Sue was unaware of the way cholera is really spread, by [[fecal]] contamination of water.  He was writing before the London physician [[John Snow (physician)|John Snow]] investigated the cause of an 1854 cholera outbreak in [[Soho]], thus originating modern [[epidemiology]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Wandering Jew and Hérodiade are condemned to wander the earth until the entire Rennepont family has disappeared from the earth.  The connection is that the descendants of the sister are also the descendants of Marius de Rennepont, [[Huguenot]]s persecuted under [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]] by the [[Jesuits]]. Sue never explains how a Huguenot family came to be descended from an immortal Jewish woman who never married or had children. The brother and sister are compelled to protect this very family from all harm.  After this first introduction, the two appear only very rarely.

The Rennepont family is unaware that these protective ''[[Eminence grise|éminences grise]]s'' exist, but they benefit from their protection in various ways, be it by being saved from scalping by the Native Americans, or from languishing in prison.

The Rennepont family lost its position and most of its wealth during the French persecution of the [[Protestants]] (after the [[Revocation of the Edict of Nantes]] in 1685). A small fortune was given to a [[Jewish]] banker immediately before the Renneponts dispersed all over Europe and Asia, and this fortune has grown into a huge sum, through the miracle of compound interest.  In 1682, the Rennepont family members each got a bronze medal telling them to meet back in Paris 150 years later, at which time the fortune will be divided among the surviving members.  So much time has passed, however, that almost none of the still-living Renneponts have any idea why they need to come to Paris. They nevertheless set out from India, Siberia, America, France, and elsewhere to make their way to rue Saint-François No. 3 in Paris by 13 February 1832.

The members of the family are not only dispersed all over the world, but also all over the social ladder, as laborers, factory owners, princes (in India!) and the independently wealthy.

The Jesuits have heard of this huge fortune and want to get it for themselves. Two Jesuits (Rodin and Père d'Aigrigny) and their many recruited accomplices are in charge of obtaining the money for the [[Society of Jesus]] and dispossessing the Rennepont family. Their plan is to have only the unwitting Gabriel, the Jesuit missionary, show up to claim the fortune. Since he is a monk and can have no possessions of his own, the fortune will go to the wily Jesuits. Gabriel's entry into the order is not accidental – it is his pious mother, manipulated by the Jesuits, who persuaded him to become a Jesuit.

The Jesuits have spies and henchmen all over the world, from the remote Americas to [[Siberia]], and they use them to put obstacles in the paths of the Renneponts as they make their way back to Paris. Moreover, they also spy on each other, demonstrating that they don't even trust each other.

The principal obstacles are as follows:
*Gabriel, Jesuit missionary in America, Rennepont.  No obstacles, because he is supposed to collect the fortune.
*Dagobert, friend of the Rennepont family and guardian of the orphans Rose and Blanche (see below).  Has his papers and the medal stolen by Morok, an animal tamer and accomplice of the Jesuits. Also has his horse, Jovial, killed by Morok's panther. Forced to travel on foot without papers and arrested for vagrancy. Freed by Hérodiade. Lured to a false meeting with a notary pretending to have messages from Général Simon (see below).
*Rose and Blanche, twin Rennepont orphans coming from Siberia.  Since they are under Dagobert's protection, they are also arrested and put in jail for vagrancy. Also, they are put in a convent by Dagobert's wife while Dagobert is at the notary meeting.  She is made to swear by the Jesuits that she will not tell Dagobert where they are.
Général Simon, father of Rose and Blanche, is a Rennepont, unknown to his daughters. Général Simon has been so long exiled from France and his family that he doesn't even know he has daughters.  He thinks he has one son.  He does not arrive for the meeting, either, although his situation is less clear than that of the others.  
*Djalma, Indian prince Rennepont, coming from the Far East. In Java, Djalma is accused of belonging to a murderous sect called the “Etrangleurs,” who closely resemble the [[Thuggee]]. One of the Jesuit henchmen tattoos Djalma with the Etrangleur tattoo on the inside of his arm while he is asleep. Djalma tries to prove that he is not an Etrangleur, but because of the tattoo is thrown in jail. This causes him to miss the boat to Paris.  After finally arriving in Paris, he is poisoned by Farighea (whom he had thought was his friend), so that he goes into a prolonged sleep. The Jesuits then kidnap him.
*Jacques Rennepont, Parisian workman.  He was given papers by his father that explain his fortune, but since he doesn't know how to read or write, he is unable to use them. The Jesuits send a money lender to him; when he cannot repay the loan, he is thrown into debtors' prison.
*François Hardy, progressive factory owner, Paris. He is betrayed by his best friend who, under the influence of Père d'Aigrigny, lures Hardy to central France, ensuring that he will not arrive on 13 February.
*Adrienne de Cardoville, independently wealthy, Paris. Lives with her aunt, who is a former mistress of father d'Aigrigny.  The aunt, the abbot Aigrigny, and a Jesuit doctor Baleinier connive to put Adrienne in an insane asylum that happens to be next to the convent where Rose and Blanche are trapped.

Only Gabriel shows up to the meeting, but at the last minute Hérodiade makes an appearance.  Gabriel recognizes her from when she rescued him in the Americas.  Hérodiade goes to a drawer and pulls out a [[Codicil (will)|codicil]] that explains that the parties have three and a half months from 13 February to present themselves.  Upon this unexpected turn of events the Père d'Aigrigny is fired, and Rodin replaces him.  He decides to take more drastic action by using cholera to annihilate some of the Rennepont family.  He maneuvers Rose, Blanche, and Jacques in front of the cholera epidemic and thereby rids himself of them.

With François Hardy, Rodin shows him how Hardy's best friend had betrayed him.  He also arranges for Hardy's mistress to leave for the Americas, and has Hardy's treasured factory burn to the ground (all this on the same day). Hardy takes refuge among the Jesuits, who persuade him to enter their order.

Djalma falls in love with Adrienne, so the Jesuits use his passion to destroy him: they make Djalma think that Adrienne has been unfaithful, and he poisons himself.  But he dies slowly and drinks only half the bottle, so there's plenty of time for Adrienne to find out what he's done and poison herself, too. ( c.f. [[Romeo and Juliet]]).

On the day of the second meeting, none of the Renneponts show up (Gabriel having quit the Jesuits), and Rodin alone presents himself. But Samuel, the guardian of the house, has realized the injustices that have taken place. He brings the coffins of all the Renneponts back to show Rodin his wickedness, and he burns the testament that would have given Rodin access to the money.

Gabriel and Hardy die as a matter of course, which means that the Wandering Jew and Hérodiade can finally rest in peace. The last pages of the novel recount their final "death," which they joyfully encounter. It is not clear what finally happens to the vast fortune that was never claimed.

==Publication==
''The Wandering Jew'' was a serially published novel, which attained great popularity in Paris, and beyond.   According to historian [[John McGreevy]], the novel was intensely and deliberately "anti-Catholic."&lt;ref name=McGreevy&gt;''Catholicism and American Freedom,'', [[John McGreevy]] Norton and Co., New York 2003, p. 22-23.&lt;/ref&gt; Its publication, and that of its predecessor ''[[The Mysteries of Paris]]'', greatly increased the circulation of the magazines in which they were published; in addition they are held to have influenced legislation on the [[Jesuit]]s, and caused a general "jesuitophobie".  The novel is over 1400 pages long. An opera, ''[[Le Juif errant (opera)|Le Juif errant]]'', by [[Fromental Halévy]], was based on elements of the novel.

The '''Two-Headed Monster''' is a comical, light purple [[The Muppets|Muppet]] monster on the television show ''[[Sesame Street]]'', first appearing in season 9, 1978.

==History==
The Two-Headed Monster, as the name implies, is an example of [[Polycephaly|bicephaly]]. The right-hand head has purple hair and a black beard, with upturned horns, whereas the left-hand head has black hair and a purple beard, with downturned horns. They have slightly different personalities, with the left-hand head seemingly the more rational and sensible of the two, but also slightly grouchier. Speaking in baby-like gibberish except when emphasizing a word, which is usually enough for them to communicate with others, the monster, in typical sketches, would sound out words in front of a brick wall, or do something else which involves cooperation. They are presumably [[dicephalic parapagus twins]], as their mother made an appearance in one sketch when they sounded the word "mom"; she has a single head and speaks normally. They share a single pair of arms and legs.

==Inspiration==
The creation of this monster was inspired by performers [[Jerry Nelson]] and [[Richard Hunt (puppeteer)|Richard Hunt]] playing around on the set one day, saying that they were a monster with two heads.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.muppetcentral.com/articles/interviews/nelson4.shtml&lt;/ref&gt; While right-handed performers use their right hands to perform the heads of characters and their left to perform left hands, whoever performs the left half of the monster performs the head with the left hand, and the right hand with their right hand.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2501">'''Widowed Mother’s Allowance''' was part of the United Kingdom system of Social Security benefits.

It was established under the [[National Insurance Act 1946]] and abolished and replaced by [[Widowed Parent's Allowance]] in 2001.  [[William Beveridge]]'s view was: "There is no reason why a childless widow should get a pension for life; if she is able to work, she should work. On the other hand, provision much better than at present should be made for those who, because they have the care of children, cannot work for gain or cannot work regularly".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Beveridge: Change 17 Widow’s Pension|url=http://www.sochealth.co.uk/public-health-and-wellbeing/beveridge-report/beveridge-change-17-widows-pension/|work=Beveridge Report 1942|publisher=Socialist Health Association|accessdate=2 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Main conditions==
The widow had to be receiving [[Child Benefit]] for a child who was either hers and her late husband’s, or a child the husband was entitled to Child Benefit for before his death, or a child of hers by an earlier marriage which ended by her being widowed, if she was living with her late husband when he died, or she was expecting a child of her late husband’s (a child conceived by artificial insemination counts if she was living with her husband after that),

Or a person under 19 lives with her who would fit into the previous category, but didn’t get Child Benefit at the time because he or she  was abroad when the husband died.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ogus &amp; Barendt|title=The Law of Social Security|year=1988|publisher=Butterworths|isbn=0406633703|page=234}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The amount was £77.45 a week in 2004 if the husband’s contribution record was sufficient. It was possible to get a reduced rate of benefit and an earnings-related component.

The benefit lasted as long as the children qualified her for it. The main benefit was taxable but the increase for children wasn’t.

The husband must have paid at least 52 times the minimum [[National Insurance contributions]] in any tax year before he died, and he must have paid contributions for sufficient years out of his working life. It was taken into account in full for all benefits.

There was an addition of £11.35 a week for each child after the first, for whom £9.55 was payable.
