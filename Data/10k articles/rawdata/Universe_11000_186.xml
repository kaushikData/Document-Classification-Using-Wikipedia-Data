The '''[[Kazan]] gas explosion''' occurred on January 9, 2008, destroying an entire corner of a three-story [[khrushchyovka]]-style apartment building on Malaya Pechyorskaya Street in the [[Aviastroitelny District]] of [[Kazan]], [[Tatarstan]], [[Russia]].  The explosion took place at 0:28&amp;nbsp;a.m. local time ([[UTC]] +3).

The blast destroyed 12 apartments and killed ten residents, including one woman who died of blast-related trauma in a [[hospital]] after being rescued from the rubble. Additionally, two were non-fatally wounded.

Rescue efforts were complicated by low temperatures of -30&amp;nbsp;°C, raising concerns that victims trapped in the destroyed building might freeze before being reached by rescuers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rt.com/news/apartment-blast-kills-eight-in-kazan/|title=Apartment blast kills eight people in Kazan|publisher=[[RT (TV network)|RT]]|date=9 January 2008|accessdate=6 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Three of the building residents, including one child, were not immediately accounted for. However, several body parts were found in the ruins,&lt;ref&gt;[http://gzt.ru/incident/2008/01/14/194250.html В Казани в развалинах взорвавшегося дома найдены фрагменты останков тел] {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; and subsequent DNA analyses determined that the young girl and her grandfather were both among those killed in the explosion. The girl's grandmother, also thought to have been in the apartment, is still counted missing.&lt;ref name="followup"&gt;{{Cite web

The exact cause of the blast has not been established. While a criminal investigation was initiated, city authorities suspect that the cause may have been improper use of gas appliances.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kp.ru/daily/24031/94152 Из-за взрыва в квартире №13 погиб человек], ''[[Komsomolskaya Pravda]]'' {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Kazan city government arranged for residents of the building destroyed in the blast to receive apartments in newly constructed buildings. On July 10, 2008, the first nine affected families received keys to new apartments in a building on [[Fatix Amirxan|Amirkhan]] Street. The residents received the apartments in exchange for their destroyed ones, an arrangement set up by the city-held ''[[Open joint-stock company|OAO]] Residential Investment Company of the City of Kazan'' and supported by Kazan mayor [[Ilsur Metshin]] and the district administration. Families were also given the opportunity to pay for larger apartments at a discounted price per square meter.&lt;ref name="recpt"&gt;[http://www.gik-kazan.ru/index.php?p=05_02_20080710000000 "Жители дома, пострадавшего от взрыва бытового газа, обрели новые квартиры."] (July 10, 2008) ''Жилишная инвестиционная компания г.Казани''&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''After the Wind: 1996 Everest Tragedy—One Survivor’s Story''''' is a book by Lou Kasischke that details his experiences as a client on [[Rob Hall]]’s expedition during the [[1996 Mount Everest disaster|1996 Mount Everest tragedy]]. The accident killed eight climbers—including four from the Hall expedition—and remained the worst climbing accident on [[Mount Everest|Everest]] until the [[2014 Mount Everest avalanche]]. The book features 55 illustrations by Jane Cardinal and was published in 2014 by Good Hart Publishing.

==Overview==
Initially written in the aftermath of the tragedy, Kasischke waited 16 years to release ''After the Wind''. The book focuses on the events leading up to the ascent, Kasischke’s experiences on the mountain, and his motivation for turning around 400 feet from the summit, as well as the close relationship he shares with his wife, Sandy.

Using the analytical skills acquired from his many years as a corporate attorney, Kasischke also offers a fresh analysis of how the tragedy unfolded and the decisions—both individual and collective—that contributed to it. Though Kasischke avoids blaming any single person for the tragedy, he does note that the presence of journalist [[Jon Krakauer]] may have caused guide [[Rob Hall]], whose [[Adventure Consultants]] business was in competition with [[Scott Fischer]]’s [[Mountain Madness]], to take uncharacteristic risks on the mountain in an effort to get as many clients as possible to the summit and subsequently receive favorable press from Krakauer's report.

==Reception==
''After the Wind'' received favorable reviews from critics. ''[[Kirkus Reviews]]'' gave the book a starred review,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/lou-kasischke/after-the-wind/|title=AFTER THE WIND|author=Lou Kasischke|work=Kirkus Reviews|accessdate=14 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; describing it as “a vivid, intimate memoir that, with great clarity and attention to detail, tells an unforgettable survival story.” Blue Ink Reviews labelled the book a “thoughtful, well-written love story” and “an edge-of-your-seat description of navigating and mountaineering Everest,” and awarded the book a starred review.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.blueinkreview.com/book-reviews/after-the-wind-1996-everest-tragedy-one-survivors-story/&lt;/ref&gt; It was also nominated for the 2014 Kirkus Prize for non-fiction and was a finalist for Eric Hoffer Grand Prize and First Horizon Book Awards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hofferaward.com/HAFirstHorizonshortlist.html#.VW8ZeVxVhBc|title=Eric Hoffer Book Award - First Horizon Short List|work=hofferaward.com|accessdate=14 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A reviewer of ''[[Publishers Weekly]]'' commented "His narrative is stark and accessible, bringing the mountaineer’s journey to life in accessible language, though the internal monologue veers toward self-indulgent reflection and recriminations... Regardless of why the tragedy occurred, Kasischke’s account provides an eye-opening look at the perils and extreme conditions on Everest. Evocative illustrations by Jane Cardinal further enhance the text, and include maps and time lines".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=After the Wind: 1996 Everest Tragedy— One Survivor’s Story |url=https://www.publishersweekly.com/978-1-940877-00-6 |website=[[Publishers Weekly]] |accessdate=9 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7187">'''Autecology''' is an approach in [[ecology]] that seeks to explain the distribution and abundance of species by studying interactions of individual organisms with their environments. An autecological approach differs from both [[community ecology]] (synecology) and [[population ecology]] by greater recognition of the species-specific adaptations of individual animals, plants or other organisms, and of environmental over density-dependent influences on species distributions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Walter|first1=GH|last2=Hengeveld|first2=R|year=2000|title=The Structure of the two ecological paradigms|journal=Acta Biotheoretica|volume=48|pages=15–36}}&lt;/ref&gt; Autecological theory relates the species-specific requirements and environmental tolerances of individuals to the geographic distribution of the species, with individuals tracking suitable conditions, having the capacity for migration at at least one stage in their life cycles.&lt;ref&gt; name=Walter2014&gt;{{Walter, GH; Hengeveld, R (2014). Autecology: organisms, interactions and environmental dynamics. Boca Raton: CRC Press.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Autecology has a strong grounding in evolutionary theory,including the theory of [[punctuated equilibrium]] and the recognition concept of species.&lt;ref name=paterson&gt;{{cite book|last=Paterson|first=HEH|year=1993|title=Evolution and the recognition concept of species|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|location=Baltimore}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=February 2018}}
==History==
Autecology was pioneered by German field botanists in the late 19th century&lt;ref&gt;Cittadino E. 1990. Nature as the Laboratory. Darwinian Plant Ecology in the German  Empire,  1880-1900.  Cambridge:  Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;. During the 20th century, autecology continued to exist mainly as a descriptive science rather than one with supporting theory and the most notable proponents of an autecological approach, Herbert Andrewartha and Charles Birch, avoided the term autecology when referring to species-focused ecological investigation with emphasis on density-independent processes. Part of the problem with deriving a theoretical structure for autecology is that individual species are unique in their life history and behaviour, making it difficult to draw broad generalisations across them without losing the crucial information that is gained by studying biology at a species level&lt;ref&gt;name=Walter2014/&lt;/ref&gt;. Progress has been made in more recent times with Paterson’s recognition concept of species and the concept of habitat tracking by organisms &lt;ref&gt;Hengeveld R. 1985. Dynamics of Dutch beetle species during the twentieth century  (Coleoptera,  Carabidae).  Journal of  Biogeography  12: 389-411.&lt;/ref&gt;. The most recent attempt at deriving a theoretical structure for autecology was published in 2014 by ecologists Gimme Walter and Rob Hengeveld.

==Basic theory==
===Recognition concept===
Autecological theory is focused on species as the most important unit of biological organisation, as individuals across all populations of a particular species share species-specific adaptations that influence their ecology.&lt;ref&gt;name=Walter2014/&lt;/ref&gt; This particularly relates to reproduction, as individuals of a sexual species share unique adaptations (e.g. courtship songs, pheromones) for recognising potential mates, and share a fertilisation mechanism that differs from those in all other species. This recognition concept of species differs from the biological species concept (or isolation concept) which defines species by cross-mating sterility, which in allopatric speciation is merely a consequence of adaptive change in a new species' fertilisation mechanism to suit a different environment.&lt;ref name=paterson/&gt;{{page needed|date=February 2018}}

===Environmental matching===
Individuals from across a species' range tend to be relatively uniform in terms of their dietary and habitat requirements and the range of environmental conditions they can tolerate. These differ from those of other species. Individuals of a species likewise share specific sensory adaptations for recognising suitable habitat. Seasonal changes and variability in climate mean that the spatial and/or temporal distribution of suitable habitat for a species also varies&lt;ref&gt;name=Walter2014/&lt;/ref&gt;.In response, organisms track suitable conditions, for example by migrating in order to remain within suitable habitat, for which there is evidence in the fossil record.&lt;ref&gt;Turner A and Paterson H (1991) Species and speciation: evolutionary tempo and mode in the fossil record reconsidered. Geobios 24:761-769.&lt;/ref&gt; By determining the requirements and tolerances of a particular species, it is possible to predict how individuals of that species will respond to specific environmental changes &lt;ref&gt;name=Walter2014/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Population sizes and replacement level reproduction===

Autecological theory predicts that populations will reproduce at around replacement level unless a period of environmental change causing unusually high or low survival causes the population to grow or shrink before restabilising at replacement level again &lt;ref&gt;Robin  J-P,  Denis  V.  1999.  Squid  stock  fluctuations  and  water  temperature:  temporal analysis of English Channel Loliginidae. Journal of Applied Ecology 36: 101-110.&lt;/ref&gt;. Population numbers may be reduced by introduction of new predation pressure, such as with poor fisheries management or introduction of a biological control agent to control an invasive species, such that net reproductive rate, R0, drops below replacement level&lt;ref&gt;name=Walter2014/&lt;/ref&gt;. The species being preyed upon in each case may stabilise at a lower population density where it is more difficult for individuals of the higher trophic level to locate the prey species, but at this point relieving predation tends to make little difference to population size, as individuals continue to reproduce around replacement level as they were at a higher density prior to the introduction of a higher trophic level &lt;ref&gt;Walter GH (2003) Insect Pest Management and Ecological Research Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK. &lt;/ref&gt;.

===Conservation autecology===
Knowledge of species-level interactions, tolerances and habitat requirements is valuable for conservation of an endangered plant or animal species by ensuring its particular ecological requirements are met. &lt;ref&gt;Gonzalez-Benito E, Martin C and Iriondo JM (1995) Autecology and conservation of Erodium paularense Fdez. Glez. &amp; Izco. Biological Conservation 72: 55-60.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

With focus on individual organism, autecology has mechanistic links to several other biological fields, including ethology, evolution, genetics and physiology&lt;ref&gt;name=Walter2014/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bioglass 45S5''', commonly referred to by its commercial name '''Bioglass''', is a [[glass]] specifically composed of 45&amp;nbsp;wt% SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, 24.5&amp;nbsp;wt% CaO, 24.5&amp;nbsp;wt% Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, and 6.0&amp;nbsp;wt% P&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; &amp;nbsp;Glasses are non-crystalline amorphous solids that are commonly composed of silica-based materials with other minor additives. &amp;nbsp;Compared to soda-lime glass (commonly used, as in windows or bottles), Bioglass 45S5 contains less silica and higher amounts of calcium and phosphorus. &amp;nbsp;The 45S5 name signifies glass with 45 weight % of SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and 5:1 molar ratio of calcium to phosphorus. &amp;nbsp;This high ratio of calcium to phosphorus promotes formation of apatite crystals; calcium and silica ions can act as crystallization nuclei.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chen|first=Q.|last2=Thompson|first2=I.|last3=Boccaccini|first3=A.|date=2006|title=45S5 Bioglass®-derived glass–ceramic scaffolds for bone tissue engineering|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0142961205010422|journal=Biomaterials|volume=27|pages=2414–2425|doi=10.1016/j.biomaterials.2005.11.025}}&lt;/ref&gt; &amp;nbsp;Lower Ca:P ratios do not bond to bone.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jones|first=J.R.|date=2013|title=Review of bioactive glass: From Hench to hybrids|url=|journal=Acta Biomaterialia|volume=9|pages=4457–4486|doi=10.1016/j.actbio.2012.08.023}}&lt;/ref&gt; &amp;nbsp;Bioglass 45S5's specific composition is optimal in biomedical applications because of its similar composition to that of hydroxyapatite, the mineral component of bone. This similarity provides Bioglass' ability to be integrated with living bone.

This composition of bioactive glass is comparatively soft in comparison to other glasses. It can be [[machined]], preferably with diamond tools, or ground to powder. Bioglass has to be stored in a dry environment, as it readily absorbs moisture and reacts with it.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; [[File:MorphologyofBioglass.png|thumb|The morphology of bioglass using SEM, sintered at 900°C]]Bioglass 45S5 is the first formulation of an artificial material that was found to chemically bond with bone. One of its main medical advantages is its biocompatibility, seen in its ability to avoid an immune reaction and fibrous encapsulation. Its primary application is the repair of bone injuries or defects too large to be regenerated by the natural process.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

The first successful surgical use of Bioglass 45S5 was in replacement of [[ossicles]] in the [[middle ear]], as a treatment of [[conductive hearing loss]]. Other uses include cones for implantation into the jaw following a [[tooth extraction]]. [[Composite material]]s made of Bioglass 45S5 and patient's own bone can be used for bone reconstruction.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Further research is being conducted for the development of new processing techniques to allow for more applications of Bioglass.

==History==
Bioglass is important to the field of biomaterials as one of the first completely synthetic materials that seamlessly bonds to bone. It was developed by Larry L. Hench in the late 1960s. The idea for the material came to him during a bus ride in 1967. While working as an assistant professor at the University of Florida, Dr. Hench decided to attend the U.S. Army Materials Research Conference held in Sagamore, New York, where he planned to talk about radiation resistant electronic materials. He began discussing his research with a fellow traveller on the bus, Colonel Klinker, who had recently returned to the United States after serving as an Army medical supply officer in Vietnam.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hench|first=L.L.|date=December 2006|title=The story of Bioglass|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/6675044_The_Story_of_BioglassR|journal=Journal of Materials Science in Medicine|volume=17|pages=967–78|doi=10.1007/s10856-006-0432-z}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After listening to Dr. Hench's description of his research, the Colonel asked, “If you can make a material that will survive exposure to high energy radiation can you make a material that will survive exposure to the human body?”&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Klinker then went on to describe the amputations that he had witnessed in Vietnam, which resulted from the body's rejection of metal and plastic implants. Hench realized that there was a need for a novel material that could form a living bond with tissues in the body.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

When Hench returned to Florida after the conference, he submitted a proposal to the U.S. Army Medical Research and Design Command. He received funding in 1968, and in November 1969 Hench began to synthesize small rectangles of what he called 45S5 glass. Ted Greenlee, Assistant Professor of Orthopaedic Surgery at the University of Florida, implanted them in rat femurs at the VA Hospital in Gainesville. Six weeks later, Greenlee called Hench asking, "Larry, what are those samples you gave me? They will not come out of the bone. I have pulled on them, I have pushed on them, I have cracked the bone and they are still bonded in place."&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

With this first successful experiment, Bioglass was born and the first compositions studied. Hench published his first paper on the subject in 1971 in the Journal of Biomedical Materials Research, and his lab continued to work on the project for the next 10 years with continued funding from the U.S. Army. By 2006, there were over 500 papers published on the topic of bioactive glasses from different laboratories and institutions around the world.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; The first successful surgical use of Bioglass 45S5 was in replacement of [[ossicles]] in [[middle ear]] as a treatment of [[conductive hearing loss]], and the material continues to be used in bone reconstruction applications today.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== Applications ==
Bioactive glass offers good osteoconductivity and bioactivity, it can deliver cells and is biodegradable. This makes it an excellent candidate to be used in tissue engineering applications. Although this material is known to be brittle, it is still used extensively to enhance the growth of bone since new forms of bioactive glasses are based on borate and borosilicate compositions. Bioglass can also be doped with varying quantities of elements like Copper, Zinc, or Strontium which can allow the growth and formation of healthy bone. The formation of neocartilage can also be induced with bioactive glass by using an in vitro culture of chondrocyte-seeded hydrogels and can serve as a subchondral substrate for tissue-engineered osteochondral constructs.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rahaman|first=M|date=|title=Bioactive glass in tissue engineering|url=|journal=Acta Biomaterialia|volume=7|pages=2355–2373|doi=10.1016/j.actbio.2011.03.016|pmc=3085647}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The borate-based bioactive glass has controllable degradation rates in order to match the rate at which actual bone is formed. Bone formation has been shown to enhance when using this type of material. When implanted into rabbit femurs, the 45S5 bioactive glass showed that it could induce bone proliferation at a much quicker rate than synthetic [[Hydroxylapatite|hydroxyapatite]] (HA). 45S5 glass can also be osteoconductive and osteoinductive because it allows for new bone growth along the bone-implant interface as well as within the bone-implant interface. Studies have been conducted to determine the process by which it can induce bone formation. It was shown that 45S5 glass degrades and releases sodium ions, as well as soluble silica, the combination of all these ions is said to produce new bone. Borate bioglass has proven that it can support cell proliferation and differentiation in vitro and in vivo. It also has shown that it is suitable to be used as a substrate for drug release when treating bone infection. However, there has been a concern as to whether or not the release of boron into a solution as borate ions will be toxic to the body. It has been shown that in static cell culture conditions, borate glasses were toxic to cells, but not in dynamic culture conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Krishnan|first=Vidya|last2=Lakshmi|first2=T|date=2013-04-01|title=Bioglass: A novel biocompatible innovation|url=http://www.japtr.org/text.asp?2013/4/2/78/111523|journal=Journal of Advanced Pharmaceutical Technology &amp; Research|language=en|volume=4|issue=2|doi=10.4103/2231-4040.111523|pmc=3696226|pmid=23833747}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another area in which bioactive glass has been investigated to use is [[Tooth enamel|enamel]] reconstruction, which has proven to be a difficult task in the field of dentistry. Enamel is made up of a very organized hierarchical microstructure of carbonated hydroxyapatite nanocrystals. It has been reported that Bioglass 45S5-phosphoric acid paste can be used to form an interaction layer that can obstruct dentinal tubule orifices and can therefore be useful in the treatment of dentin hypersensitivity lesions.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bakry|first=A.S|date=|title=Evaluation of new treatment for incipient enamel demineralization using 45S5 bioglass|url=|journal=Dental Materials|volume=30|pages=341–320}}&lt;/ref&gt; This material in an aqueous environment could have an antibacterial property that is advantageous in [[Periodontal pathology|periodontal]] surgical procedures. In a study done with 45S5 Bioglass, control [[biofilm]]s of [[Streptococcus sanguinis|S. sanguis]] were grown on inactive glass particulates and the biofilm grown on the Bioglass was significantly lower than those that were on the inactive glass. It was concluded that Bioglass can reduce surface bacterial formation, which could benefit post-surgical periodontal wound healing. The most effective antibacterial bioactive glass is S53P4, which has exhibited a growth-inhibitory effect on the pathogens that was tested on it. Bioactive glasses that are sol-gel derived, such as CaPSiO and CaPSiO II, have also exhibited antibacterial property. Studies done with [[Staphylococcus epidermidis|S. epidermidis]] and [[Escherichia coli|E. coli]] cultured with bioactive glass have shown that the 45S5 bioactive glass have a very high antibacterial resistance. It was also observed in the experiment that there were needle-like bioglass debris which could have ruptured the cell walls of the bacteria and rendered them inactive.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hu|first=S|date=|title=Study on antibacterial effect of 45S5 Bioglass|url=|journal=Journal of Materials Science: Materials in Medicine|volume=20|pages=281–286|doi=10.1007/s10856-008-3564-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bioactive glass has even been applied to medical devices to help restore the hearing to a deaf patient using Bioglass 45S5 in 1984. The patient went deaf due to at ear infection that degraded two of the three bones in her middle ear. An implant was designed to replace the damaged bone and carry sound from the eardrum to the cochlea, restoring the patient's hearing. Before this material was available, plastics and metals would be used because they did not produce a reaction in the body, however they eventually failed because tissue would grow around them after implantation. A prosthesis made up of Bioglass 45S5 was made to fit the patient and most of the prosthesis that were made were able to maintain functionality after 10 years.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jones|first=J.R.|date=|title=Review of bioactive glass: From Hench to hybrids|url=|journal=Acta Biomaterialia|volume=9|pages=4457–4486|doi=10.1016/j.actbio.2012.08.023}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Endosseous Ridge Maintenance Implant made of Bioglass 45S5 was another device that could be inserted into tooth extraction sites that would repair tooth roots and allow for a stable ridge for dentures.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

This material has also been used in jaw and orthopedics applications, in this way it dissolves and can stimulate the natural bone to repair itself. GlaxoSmithKline is using this material as an active ingredient in toothpaste &amp;nbsp;under the commercial name NovaMin, which can help repair tiny holes and decrease tooth sensitivity.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Currently, bioactive glass is still be researched and has yet to reach its full capacity of use .

== Mechanism of action ==
[[File:Bioglass Surface Reaction.jpg|thumb|381x381px|The integration of Bioglass with bone. The reaction with surrounding physiological fluid at the surface of Bioglass is shown in first two steps, and the formation of new bone is shown in the last two stages.]]
When implanted, Bioglass 45S5 reacts with the surrounding physiological fluid, causing the formation of a hydroxyl carbonated apatite (HCA) layer at the material surface. The HCA layer has a similar composition to&amp;nbsp;[[Hydroxylapatite|hydroxyapatite]], the mineral phase of bone, a quality which allows for strong interaction and integration with bone. The process by which this reaction occurs can be separated into 12 steps. The first 5 steps are related to the Bioglass response to the environment within the body, and occur rapidly at the material surface over several hours.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Rabiee, S.M.|author2=Nazparvar, N.|author3=Azizian, M.|author4=Vashaee, D.|author5=Tayebi, L.|date=July 2015|title=Effect of ion substitution on properties of bioactive glasses: A review|url=|journal=Ceramics International|volume=41|pages=7241–7251|doi=10.1016/j.ceramint.2015.02.140}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reaction steps 6-10 detail the reaction of the body to the integration of the biomaterial, and the process of integration with bone. These stages occur over the scale of several weeks or months.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hench|first=L. L.|date=July 1998|title=Bioceramics|url=|journal=Journal of the American Ceramic Society|volume=81|pages=1705–1728|doi=10.1111/j.1151-2916.1998.tb02540.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; The steps are separated as follows:&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

1. Alkali ions (ex. Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;and Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;) on the glass surface rapidly exchange with hydrogen ions or hydronium from surrounding bodily fluids. The reaction below shows this process, which causes hydrolysis of silica groups. As this occurs, the pH of the solution increases.

Si⎯O⎯Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+ H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+ OH&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;→ Si⎯OH&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+ Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;(aq) + OH&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;

2. Due to an increase in the hydroxyl (OH&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;) concentration at the surface (a result of step 1), a dissolution of the silica glass network occurs, seen by the breaking of Si⎯O⎯Si bonds. Soluble silica is transformed to the form of Si(OH)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;and silanols (Si⎯OH) creation occurs at the material surface. The reaction occurring in this stage is shown below:

Si⎯O⎯Si + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O→ Si⎯OH + OH⎯Si

3. The silanol groups at the material surface condense and re-polymerize to form a silica-gel layer at the surface of Bioglass. As a result of the first steps, the surface contains very little alkali content. The condensation reaction is shown below:

Si⎯OH + Si⎯OH → Si⎯O⎯Si

4. Amorphous Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;and PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3−&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;gather at the silica-rich layer (created in step 3) from both the surrounding bodily fluid and the bulk of the Bioglass. This creates a layer composed primarily of CaO⎯P&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;on top of the silica layer.

5. The CaO⎯P&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;film created in step 4 incorporates OH&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;and CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;from the bodily solution, causing it to crystallize. This layer is called a mixed carbonated hydroxyl apatite (HCA).

6. Growth factors adsorb to the surface of Bioglass due to its structural and chemical similarities to hydroxyapatite.

7. Adsorbed growth factors cause the activation of M2&amp;nbsp;[[macrophage]]s. M2 macrophages tend to promote wound healing and the initiate the migration of progenitor cells to an injury site. In contrast, M1 macrophages become activated when a non-biocompatible material is implanted, triggering an inflammatory response.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Roszer|first=T.|date=|title=Understanding the Mysterious M2 Macrophage through Activation Markers and Effector Mechanisms|url=|journal=Mediators of Inflammation|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

8. Triggered by M2 macrophage activation,&amp;nbsp;[[mesenchymal stem cell]]s&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;[[Osteochondroprogenitor cell|osteoprogenitor cells]]&amp;nbsp;migrate to the Bioglass surface and attach to the HCA layer.

9. Stem cells and osteoprogenitor cells at the HCA surface differentiate to become osteogenic cells typically present in&amp;nbsp;[[bone tissue]], particularly&amp;nbsp;[[osteoblast]]s.

10. The attached and differentiated osteoblasts generate and deposit&amp;nbsp;[[extracellular matrix]]&amp;nbsp;(ECM) components, primarily&amp;nbsp;[[type I collagen]], the main protein component of bone.

11. The collagen ECM becomes&amp;nbsp;[[Osteoblast#Mineralization of bone|mineralized]]&amp;nbsp;as normally occurs in native bone. Nanoscale hydroxyapatite crystals form a layered structure with the deposited collagen at the surface of the implant.

12. Following these reactions, bone growth continues as the newly recruited cells continue to function and facilitate tissue growth and repair. The Bioglass implant continues to degrade and be converted to new ECM material.

== Manufacturing ==
There are three main manufacturing techniques that are used for the synthesis of Bioglass. The first is melt quench synthesis, which is the conventional glass-making technology used by Larry Hench when he first manufactured the material in 1969. This method includes melting a mixture of oxides such as SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, CaO and P&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; at high temperatures generally above 1100-1300&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Deliomanli|first=Aylin M.|last2=Yildirim|first2=Mehmet|date=2016|title=Sol-gel synthesis of 13-93 bioactive glass powders containing therapeutic agents|url=https://austceram.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/2-JACS-52-2-Aylin-9-19.pdf|journal=Journal of the Australian Ceramic Society|volume=52[2]|pages=9–19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Platinum or platinum alloy [[crucible]]s to are used avoid contamination, which would interfere with the product's chemical reactivity in organism. [[Annealing (glass)|Annealing]] is a crucial step in forming bulk parts, due to high [[thermal expansion]] of the material. Heat treatment of Bioglass reduces the volatile alkali metal oxide content and precipitates apatite crystals in the glass matrix. However, the scaffolds that result from melt quench techniques are much less porous compared to other manufacturing methods, which may lead to defects in tissue integration when implanted in vivo.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hench|first=L.L.|last2=Paschall|first2=H.A.|date=1973|title=DIrect chemical bond of bioactive glass-ceramic materials to bone and muscle|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jbm.820070304/abstract|journal=Journal of Biomedical Materials Research|volume=7|issue=3|pages=25–42|doi=10.1002/jbm.820070304|pmid=4123968}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second method is [[sol-gel]] synthesis of Bioglass. This process is carried out at much lower temperatures than the traditional melting methods. It involves the creation of a solution (sol), which is composed of metal-organic and metal salt precursors. A gel is then formed through hydrolysis and condensation reactions, and it undergoes thermal treatment for drying, oxide formation, and organic removal. Because of the lower fabrication temperatures used in this method, there is a greater level of control on the composition and homogeneity of the product. In addition, sol-gel bioglasses have much higher porosity, which leads to a greater surface area and degree of integration in the body.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

The third method is microwave synthesis of Bioglass, which has been gaining attention in recent years. Microwave synthesis is a rapid and low-cost powder synthesis method in which precursors are dissolved in water, transferred to an ultrasonic bath, and irradiated. The resulting amorphous powder is then filtered, dried &amp;nbsp;at 80&amp;nbsp;°C, and calcined at 700&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.4303/bda/D110155|title=Synthesis of Bioactive Glass by Microwave Energy Irradiation and its In-Vitro Biocompatibility|journal=Bioceramics Development and Applications|volume=1|pages=1–3|year=2011|last1=Sarkar|first1=Swapan Kumar|last2=Lee|first2=Byong Taek}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Shortcomings ==
A setback to using Bioglass 45S5 is that it is difficult to process into porous 3D scaffolds. These porous scaffolds are usually prepared by [[sintering]] glass particles that are already formed into the 3D geometry and allowing them to bond to the particles into a strong glass phase made up of a network of pores. Since this particular type of bioglass cannot fully sinter by viscous flow above its [[Glass transition temperature|Tg]], and its Tg is close to the onset of crystallization, it is hard to sinter this material into a dense network.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

45S5 glass also has a slow degradation and rate of conversion to an HA-like material. This setback makes it more difficult for the degradation rate of the scaffold to coincide with the rate of tissue formation. Another limitation is that the biological environment can be easily influenced by its degradation. Increases in the sodium and calcium ions and changing pH is due to its degradation. However, the roles of these ions and their toxicity to the body have not been fully researched.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== Methods of improvement ==
Several studies have investigated methods to improve the mechanical strength and toughness of Bioglass 45S5. These include creating polymer-glass [[Composite material|composite]]s, which combine the [[bioactivity]] of Bioglass with the relative flexibility and [[wear resistance]] of different polymers. Another solution is coating a metallic [[Implant (medicine)|implant]] with Bioglass, which takes advantage of the mechanical strength of the implant's bulk material while retaining bioactive effects at the surface. Some of the most notable modifications have used various forms of carbon to improve the properties of 45S5 glass.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Li|first=Z.|date=January 2017|title=Mechanical, tribological and biological properties of novel 45S5 Bioglass® composites reinforced with in situ reduced graphene oxide|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1751616116302648|journal=Journal of Mechanical Behavior of Biomedical Materials|volume=65|pages=77–89|doi=10.1016/j.jmbbm.2016.08.007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, Touri et al. developed a method to incorporate [[carbon nanotube]]s (CNTs) into the structure without interfering with the material's bioactive properties. CNTs were chosen because of their large aspect ratio and high strength. By synthesizing Bioglass 45S5 on a CNT scaffold, the researchers were able to create a composite that more than doubled the [[compressive strength]] and the [[elastic modulus]] when compared to the pure glass.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Touri|first=R|date=September 2013|title=The Use of Carbon Nanotubes to Reinforce 45S5 Bioglass-Based Scaffolds for Tissue Engineering|url=|journal=BioMed Research International|volume=2013|pages=|doi=10.1155/2013/465086}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another study carried out by Li et al. looked into different properties, such as the [[fracture toughness]] and wear resistance of Bioglass 45S5. The authors loaded [[graphene]] nanoplatelets (GNP) into the glass structure through a [[spark plasma sintering]] method. Graphene was chosen because of its high specific surface area and strength, as well as its cytocompatibility and lack of interference with Bioglass 45S5's bioactivity. The composites that were created in this experiment achieved a fracture toughness of more than double the control. In addition, the [[tribological]] properties of the material were greatly improved.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

== Team History ==

=== The First Vehicle ===
In 1997, the Blue Sky Solar Racing Team produced its first solar powered vehicle named Blue Sky Project.&lt;ref&gt;Team History. [http://www.blueskysolar.utoronto.ca/blueskyprogram/teamhistory/ "Team History"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101003070309/http://www.blueskysolar.utoronto.ca/blueskyprogram/teamhistory/ |date=October 3, 2010 }}. Blue Sky Solar Racing. Retrieved 2010-12-12&lt;/ref&gt; Being the very first car, Blue Sky Project served as a test bed to work out the organizational and operational relationships required to build a car that was capable of qualifying and participating in competition. The project was deemed as a success.{{Citation needed|date=March 2014}} The successful freshman effort gave the team a firm foundation to further expand its capabilities to compete with other well-established Canadian solar car racing teams such as [[Midnight Sun Solar Race Team]] and [[Queen's University Solar Vehicle Team]].

=== Florida SunDay Challenge 1997 ===
As Blue Sky Solar Racing Team's freshman effort in the competitive scene of solar car racing, Florida SunDay Challenge 1997 served as a proof that the University of Toronto had the capability to produce world-class solar vehicles despite their inexperience. Ranking 3rd overall in the competition&lt;ref name="Team History"/&gt; with their first vehicle – Blue Sky Project, the rookie team's impressive results fueled their expansion and development. Participation in the race also gave the team an invaluable learning experience which formed the foundation of the team's later innovations.

=== SunRayce '99 ===
Blue Sky Solar Racing Team's Blue II competed in [[Sunrayce 99|SunRayce '99]] in [[Orlando, Florida]]. Finishing 9th in the qualifying round, Blue II showed great promise. However, the race was struck with poor weather conditions throughout the competition and recharging the solar vehicle became a great challenge for the team. The team was forced to adjust their racing strategy and optimize their power usage under the new weather constraints so they did not exhaust the battery. Despite such poor weather conditions, Blue II traveled over 2250&amp;nbsp;km over a span of 9 days and ranked 20th overall in the competition. The team was also awarded "Best Rookie Team" in recognition of their achievements in the race.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;"Winter 1999 Newsletter". Blue Sky Solar Racing.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== World Solar Challenge 2001 ===
With the team's third generation solar vehicle, Faust, the team took on the world stage for the first time at the World Solar Challenge. Faust ran a perfect race without a single mishap and not once was there an emergency during the racing that required Faust to be pulled over. For 5 days straight, the team drove for 8 hours through the Australian continent covering 3010&amp;nbsp;km in total. The team ranked 14th overall in the competition, besting many teams with years of experience; an excellent achievement for a rookie team.&lt;ref&gt;"Spring 2002 Newsletter". Blue Sky Solar Racing&lt;/ref&gt;

=== American Solar Challenge 2001 ===
The [[North American Solar Challenge|American Solar Challenge]] 2001 served as one of the greatest challenges that Blue Sky Solar Racing Team has faced to date. Crossing seven states, Blue Sky's third generation vehicle, Faust, was tasked with overcoming long stretches of rough terrain. This put the vehicle's handling and stability to the test as solar vehicles are rarely designed to withstand such a beating. The rough road conditions of the [[Great Plains]] and [[Rocky Mountains]] caused havoc to the suspension system in the vehicle and caused a cascade effect throughout other systems. Quick, temporary fixes were implemented when breakdowns occurred during official race hours, and long nights of repair would ensue at the end of each race day.  After several sleepless nights, the team completed the 3595&amp;nbsp;km race in 79 hours 8 minutes and 57 seconds, which included 10 hours of penalties. The team ranked 12th in the competition and was one of the few teams that were able to fully complete the race.&lt;ref&gt;"Summer 2001 Newsletter". Blue Sky Solar Racing.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== American Solar Challenge 2003 ===
With experience of the competition's grueling road conditions, Blue Sky Solar Racing Team returned to the American Solar Challenge in 2003 with Faust II, the successor to Blue Sky's vehicle in their first American Solar Challenge attempt. Traveling over across 8 states from [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]], to [[Los Angeles]], [[California]], Faust II proved to be an extremely capable race car. In contrast to American Solar Challenge 2001, Faust II was able to traverse the grueling terrain with no major on-road difficulties due to the improvements made to the vehicle. Logging 79 hours, 51 minutes, and 39 seconds of race time, Blue Sky captured 11th place overall and placed first out of all teams of equivalent solar array technology.&lt;ref&gt;"Winter 2003 Newsletter". Blue Sky Solar Racing.&lt;/ref&gt; The team was also presented with the American Solar Challenge Safety Award for outstanding safety practices during the competition.

=== Blue Sky Project ===
[[File:Blue sky project.png|thumb|Blue Sky Project]]
As Blue Sky Solar Racing's first project, Blue Sky Project served as an experimental effort for the team to learn more about the production of solar vehicles. The vehicle was designed as a single-seated four-wheeler with a weight of 850&amp;nbsp;lbs.&lt;ref name="blueskysolar.utoronto.ca"&gt;Car History. [http://www.blueskysolar.utoronto.ca/blueskyprogram/teamhistory/ "Team History"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101003070309/http://www.blueskysolar.utoronto.ca/blueskyprogram/teamhistory/ |date=October 3, 2010 }}. Blue Sky Solar Racing. Retrieved 2010-12-12&lt;/ref&gt; The project was completed in 1997 and was immediately put to test at the Florida SunDay Challenge 1997. The vehicle achieved extremely encouraging results for the rookie team and created a solid foundation and strong motivation for the team to continue developing solar vehicles.

Weight:     850&amp;nbsp;lbs&lt;br /&gt;Power:      650 watts, 14% silicon solar cells&lt;br /&gt;Batteries:  Lead-acid&lt;br /&gt;Competitions: Florida SunDay Challenge 1997 – 3rd Place

=== Blue II ===
[[File:B2.png|thumb|Blue II]]
Upon the success of the Blue Sky Project, Blue Sky Solar Racing decided to immediately begin production of an improved solar vehicle – Blue II.  With a much greater power output than the Blue Sky Project, Blue II was capable of achieving a top speed of 110&amp;nbsp;km/h and it was as a key milestone in the technical development of the team.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Blue II was completed in 1999 and competed in SunRayce '99. After the vehicle was decommissioned, it served for several years as the main display in the team's community education events in recognition of its milestone achievements.

Weight:     968&amp;nbsp;lbs&lt;br /&gt;
Power:      750 watts, 15% silicon solar cells&lt;br /&gt;
Batteries:  Lead-acid&lt;br /&gt;
Competitions: SunRayce '99 – 20th Place + Top Rookie Award

=== Faust ===
[[File:Faust.png|thumb|Faust]]
After learning from the experiences of their previous experimental vehicles, Blue Sky Solar Racing was prepared to make a splash on the international stage. In the design of their third generation vehicle – Faust – the team focused on several key concepts to produce a solar vehicle that was competitive in international competitions; mainly, to minimize drag and weight. This led to several drastic departures in their design traditions. First of all, in contrast to Blue II, Faust was designed as a three-wheeler to minimize rolling resistance and decrease the overall weight of the vehicle.&lt;ref&gt;"Spring 2000 Newsletter". Blue Sky Solar Racing.&lt;/ref&gt; Secondly, the chassis for Faust was made of an extremely lightweight hollow tube aluminum space frame which decreased the overall weight of the vehicle to only 440&amp;nbsp;lbs, nearly half of the weight of Blue II.&lt;ref name="blueskysolar.utoronto.ca"/&gt;  These departures in design lead to vast performance improvements which made it possible for the vehicle to achieve a top speed of 140&amp;nbsp;km/h. Construction Faust was completed in 2001 and it participated in two competitions in the same year.

Weight:     620&amp;nbsp;lbs&lt;br /&gt;
Power:      950 watts, 16.2% silicon solar cells&lt;br /&gt;
Batteries:  Lithium ion-polymer&lt;br /&gt;
Competitions: World Solar Challenge 2001 – 12th place, American Solar Challenge 2001 – 14th place

=== Faust II ===
[[File:Faust2.png|thumb|Faust II]]
Looking to improve upon the success of Faust, its successor – Faust II – aimed primarily to strengthen the build of the body and reduce weight, thus allowing it to achieve faster speeds. Learning from the damage that the grueling road conditions in the American Solar Challenge 2001 brought to Faust, the team fitted Faust II with a composite fiber cloth body which made it extremely durable while also reducing the vehicle's body weight by 40&amp;nbsp;lbs.&lt;ref&gt;"Fall 2002 Newsletter". Blue Sky Solar Racing.&lt;/ref&gt; Several other improvements were also made to the battery and motor of the vehicle. Production of Faust II was completed in 2003 and it participated in the American Solar Challenge 2003.

Weight:     600&amp;nbsp;lbs&lt;br /&gt;
Power:      1050 watts, 16.8% silicon solar cells&lt;br /&gt;
Batteries:  Lithium ion-polymer&lt;br /&gt;
Competitions: American Solar Challenge 2003 – 11th Place + Safety Award

=== Cerulean ===
[[File:Cerulean.png|thumb|Cerulean]]
While in the production phase of Faust II, Blue Sky Solar Racing began design on their fifth generation vehicle – Cerulean. Unlike its predecessors, Cerulean was designed as a double-seater vehicle; this allowed the team challenge themselves by attempting a new solar vehicle design with entirely different specifications and constraints.

As a double-seater vehicle, the team was allowed to double the solar array output to 2300W and the motor power output to 13.4&amp;nbsp;hp.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.blueskysolar.utoronto.ca/pressroom/newsletters/docs/newsletter_2006_summer.pdf "Summer 2006 Newsletter"]{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}. Blue Sky Solar Racing. Retrieved 2010-12-12&lt;/ref&gt; The team was also capable of keeping the vehicle lightweight by constructing a chassis from carbon board rails, thus minimizing the weight at 500&amp;nbsp;lbs.&lt;ref name="blueskysolar.utoronto.ca"/&gt; Despite being their first attempt at constructing a double-seater solar vehicle, Cerulean proved to be their most successful vehicle to date. With construction complete in 2007, Cerulean participated in the World Solar Challenge 2007 and placed 5th in its class, ranking it the highest amongst all Canadian teams.

Weight:     230&amp;nbsp;kg (without driver)&lt;br /&gt;

Competitions: World Solar Challenge 2007 – 5th Place in Adventure Class

=== Azure ===
Blue Sky Solar Racing's sixth generation vehicle, Azure, placed 24th in the World Solar Challenge 2011, in the Challenger Class. The design of the vehicle was guided by three requirements: The vehicle must be able to achieve high speeds yet have low power consumption, exhibit great stability at high speeds yet have a low drag value, and have a great safety margin in critical components yet remain lightweight.&lt;ref&gt;Design Philosophy.

The '''bottom quark''' or '''b quark''', also known as the '''beauty quark''', is a third-generation [[quark]] with a charge of −{{sfrac|3}}&amp;nbsp;[[elementary charge|''e'']].

All quarks are described in a similar way by [[electroweak interaction|electroweak]] and [[quantum chromodynamics]], but the bottom quark has exceptionally low rates of transition to lower-mass quarks. The bottom quark is also notable because it is a product in almost all [[top quark]] decays, and is a frequent decay product of the [[Higgs boson]].

==Name and history==
The bottom quark was first described theoretically in 1973 by physicists [[Makoto Kobayashi (physicist)|Makoto Kobayashi]] and [[Toshihide Maskawa]] to explain [[CP violation]].&lt;ref name="KM"&gt;

On its discovery, there were efforts to name the bottom quark "beauty", but "bottom" became the predominant usage, by analogy of [[top quark|"top"]] and "bottom" to [[up quark|"up"]] and [[down quark|"down"]].

==Distinct character==
The bottom quark's [[Quark#Mass|"bare" mass]] is around {{val|4.2|ul=GeV/c2}}&lt;ref name="PDG2012"/&gt; &amp;ndash; a bit more than four times the mass of a [[proton]], and many orders of magnitude larger than common "light" quarks.

Although it almost-exclusively transitions from or to a [[top quark]], the bottom quark can decay into either an [[up quark]] or [[charm quark]] via the [[weak interaction]]. [[CKM matrix]] elements ''V''&lt;sub&gt;ub&lt;/sub&gt; and ''V''&lt;sub&gt;cb&lt;/sub&gt; specify the rates, where both these decays are suppressed, making lifetimes of most bottom particles (~10&lt;sup&gt;−12&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;s) somewhat higher than those of charmed particles (~10&lt;sup&gt;−13&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;s), but lower than those of strange particles (from ~10&lt;sup&gt;−10&lt;/sup&gt; to ~10&lt;sup&gt;−8&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;s).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The combination of high mass and low transition-rate gives experimental [[particle collider|collision]] byproducts containing a bottom quark a distinctive signature that makes them relatively easy to identify using a technique called "[[B-tagging]]". For that reason, [[meson]]s containing the bottom quark are exceptionally long-lived for their mass, and are the easiest particles to use to investigate [[CP violation]]. Such experiments are being performed at the [[BaBar experiment|BaBar]], [[Belle Experiment|Belle]] and [[LHCb]] experiments.

==Hadrons containing bottom quarks==
{{Main|list of baryons|list of mesons}}
Some of the [[hadron]]s containing bottom quarks include:
*[[B meson]]s contain a bottom quark (or its [[antiparticle]]) and an [[up quark|up]] or [[down quark]].
*{{SubatomicParticle|Charmed B}} and {{SubatomicParticle|Strange B}} mesons contain a bottom quark along with a [[charm quark]] or [[strange quark]] respectively.
*There are many [[bottomonium]] states, for example the [[Upsilon meson|{{SubatomicParticle|Upsilon}} meson]] and [[chi b (3P)|χ&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;(3P)]], the first particle discovered in [[Large Hadron Collider|LHC]].  These consist of a bottom quark and its antiparticle.
*Bottom [[baryon]]s have been observed, and are named in analogy with strange baryons (e.g. {{SubatomicParticle|Bottom Lambda0}}).

A '''brazier''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|r|eɪ|ʒ|ər}}) is a container for hot coals, generally taking the form of an upright standing or hanging metal bowl or box. Used for burning [[solid fuel]], usually [[charcoal]], braziers principally provide heat, but may also be used for cooking and cultural rituals. Braziers have been recovered from many early archaeological sites like the Nimrud brazier, recently excavated by the [[Iraqi National Museum]], which dates back to at least 824 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.archaeological.org/pdfs/papers/J_Russell_recovery.pdf |title= The MPs Do It Again: Two More Antiquities from the Top 30 Are Back in the Iraq Museum |last= Russell |first= John M. |date= November 2003 |website= Archaeological Institute of America |accessdate= 2014-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:3238 - Athens - Casserole and brazier - Stoà of Attalus Museum - Photo by Giovanni Dall'Orto, Nov 9 2009.jpg|thumb|[[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greek]] brazier and [[casserole]], 6th/4th century BC, exhibited in the Ancient Agora Museum in [[Athens]], housed in the [[Stoa of Attalus]]]]
Braziers are mentioned in the [[Bible]]. The [[Hebrew]] word for brazier is of Egyptian origin, suggesting that it was imported from Egypt. There are two references to it in the Bible. The first is found in Genesis 15:17, whereby God Himself sent and provided a "smoking brazier" for the sacrifice which Abram prepared. The second is in Jeremiah 36:22–23, with braziers heating the [[winter palace]] of King [[Jehoiakim]].

The Roman Emperor [[Jovian (emperor)|Jovian]] was [[carbon monoxide poisoning|poisoned by the fumes from a brazier]] in his tent in 364, ending the line of [[Constantine the Great|Constantine]].

==Uses==

===Heating===
Despite the risks associated with burning [[charcoal]] on open fires, braziers were widely adopted as a source of domestic heat, particularly in the Spanish-speaking world. [[Fernando de Alva Cortés Ixtlilxochitl]] notes that the [[Tepanec]] [[Tlatoani]] in [[New Spain]] slept between two braziers because he was so old he produced no natural heat. Nineteenth century British travellers such as diplomat and scientist [[Woodbine Parish]] and the writer [[Richard Ford (writer)|Richard Ford]], author of ''[[A Handbook for Travellers in Spain]]'', state that in many areas braziers were considered healthier than fireplaces and chimneys.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author= [[Woodbine Parish|Parish, Sir Woodbine]] |year= 1839 |title= Buenos Ayres and the Provinces of the Rio de La Plata; Their Present State, Trade and Debt |publisher= [[John Murray (publisher)|John Murray]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="FordRichard"&gt;{{cite book |author= [[Richard Ford (writer)|Ford, Richard]] |year= 1845 |title= [[A Handbook for Travellers in Spain]] |publisher= [[John Murray (publisher)|John Murray]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The brazier did not just sit out in the open, in a room; often it was incorporated into furniture. Many cultures developed their own variants of a low table, with a heat source underneath and blankets to capture the warmth: the ''[[kotatsu]]'' in Japan, the ''[[korsi]]'' in Iran, the ''sandali'' in Afghanistan,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.icrc.org/eng/resources/documents/feature/2009/afghanistan-feature-230109.htm |title=Afghanistan: Sandali stoves, a blessing and a curse |author=Jessica Barry |publisher=[[International Committee of the Red Cross|ICRC]] |deadurl=no |accessdate=3 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[foot stove]] in northern Europe. In Spain the ''[[Brasero (heater)|brasero]]'' continued to be one of the primary means of heating houses until the early 20th century; [[Gerald Brenan]] described in his memoir ''[[South from Granada]]'' the widespread habit there in the 1920s of placing a brazier beneath a cloth-covered table to keep the legs and feet of the family warm on winter evenings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author= [[Gerald Brenan|Brenan, Gerald]] |year= 1957 |title= [[South from Granada (book)|South from Granada]] |publisher= Hamish Hamilton |isbn= 9780241890028 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scent===
When burned, moist rose and grapevine trimmings produce a pungent, sweet-smelling smoke, and make very good charcoal. When the charcoal fumes became overbearing, however, aromatics (lavender seeds, orange peel) were sometimes added to the embers in the brazier.&lt;ref name="FordRichard" /&gt; A brazier used exclusively for burning aromatics ([[incense]]) is known as a [[censer]] or [[thurible]].

===Other===
In some churches a brazier is used to create a small fire, called new fire, which is then used to light the [[Paschal candle]] during the [[Easter Vigil]].

Braziers used to be a commonplace sight on industrial [[Picketing|picket lines]], although as strikes in the UK have become increasingly [[white-collar worker|white collar]], they are seen less and less.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.theguardian.com/Columnists/Column/0,5673,849402,00.html |title= Every strike needs a brazier |first= Catherine |last= Bennett |newspaper= [[The Guardian]] |date= 2001-11-28 |accessdate= 2014-08-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Japanese, a brazier is called a ''[[hibachi]]''. They are used principally for cooking and in cultural rituals such as the [[Japanese tea ceremony]].

[[Image:TiC-xtal-3D-vdW.png|thumb|Lattice structure of [[titanium carbide]].]]
In [[chemistry]], a '''carbide''' is a compound composed of [[carbon]] and a less [[electronegativity|electronegative]] element.  Carbides can be generally classified by the chemical bonds type as follows: (i) salt-like, (ii) [[covalent compound]]s, (iii) [[interstitial compound]]s, and (iv) "intermediate" [[transition metal]] carbides. Examples include [[calcium carbide]] (CaC&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), [[silicon carbide]] (SiC), [[tungsten carbide]] (WC; often called, simply, ''carbide'' when referring to machine tooling), and [[cementite]] (Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C),&lt;ref name="Greenwood"&gt;{{Greenwood&amp;Earnshaw1st|pages=318–22}}&lt;/ref&gt; each used in key industrial applications. The naming of ionic carbides is not systematic.

==Salt-like (saline) carbides==
Salt-like carbides are composed of highly electropositive elements such as the [[alkali metal]]s, [[alkaline earth metal]]s, and group 3 metals, including [[scandium]], [[yttrium]], and [[lanthanum]].  [[Aluminium]] from group 13 forms [[Aluminium carbide|carbides]], but [[gallium]], [[indium]], and [[thallium]] do not.  These materials feature isolated carbon centers, often described as "C&lt;sup&gt;4−&lt;/sup&gt;", in the methanides or methides; two-atom units, "{{chem|C|2|2−}}", in the [[acetylide]]s; and three-atom units, "{{chem|C|3|4−}}", in the sesquicarbides.&lt;ref name="Greenwood" /&gt;  The [[graphite intercalation compound | graphite intercalation compound KC&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;]], prepared from vapour of potassium and graphite, and the alkali metal derivatives of C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt; are not usually classified as carbides.&lt;ref&gt;Shriver and Atkins&amp;nbsp;— Inorganic Chemistry&lt;/ref&gt;

===Methanides===
Carbides of this class decompose in water producing [[methane]]. Three such examples are [[aluminium carbide]]  {{chem|Al|4|C|3}}, [[magnesium carbide]]  {{chem|Mg|2|C}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/anie.201303463/abstract|title=Synthesis of Mg2C: A Magnesium Methanide|author1=O.O. Kurakevych |author2=T.A. Strobel |author3=D.Y. Kim |author4=G.D. Cody |volume =52|issue=34|year=2013|pages=8930–8933|journal=Angewandte Chemie International Edition|doi=10.1002/anie.201303463}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[beryllium carbide]] {{chem|Be|2|C}}.

Transition metal carbides are not saline carbides but their reaction  with water is very slow and is usually neglected. For example, depending on surface porosity, 5–30 atomic layers of [[titanium carbide]] are hydrolyzed, forming [[methane]] within 5 minutes at ambient conditions, following by saturation of the reaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2FBF00780135|title=Reaction of titanium carbide with water|author1=A. I. Avgustinik |author2=G. V. Drozdetskaya |author3=S. S. Ordan'yan |volume =6|issue=6|year=1967|pages=470–473|journal=Powder Metallurgy and Metal Ceramics}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Note that methanide in this context is a trivial historical name.  According to the IUPAC systematic naming conventions, a compound such as NaCH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; would be termed a  "methanide", although this compound is often called methylsodium.&lt;ref name="WeissCorbelin1990"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Weiss|first1=Erwin|last2=Corbelin|first2=Siegfried|last3=Cockcroft|first3=Jeremy Karl|last4=Fitch|first4=Andrew Nicholas|title=Über Metallalkyl- und -aryl-Verbindungen, 44 Darstellung und Struktur von Methylnatrium. Strukturbestimmung an NaCD3-Pulvern bei 1.5 und 300 K durch Neutronen- und Synchrotronstrahlenbeugung|journal=Chemische Berichte|volume=123|issue=8|year=1990|pages=1629–1634|issn=0009-2940|doi=10.1002/cber.19901230807}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Acetylides===
[[Image:Carbid.jpg|thumb|[[Calcium carbide]].]]
Several carbides are assumed to be salts of the [[acetylide|acetylide anion]] C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2– &lt;/sup&gt; (also called percarbide), which has a [[covalent bond|triple bond]] between the two carbon atoms. Alkali metals, alkaline earth metals, and [[lanthanoid|lanthanoid metals]] form acetylides, e.g., sodium carbide Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, [[calcium carbide]] CaC&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and [[lanthanum carbide|LaC&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]].&lt;ref name="Greenwood" /&gt; Lanthanides also form carbides (sesquicarbides, see below) with formula M&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. Metals from group 11 also tend to form acetylides, such as [[copper(I) acetylide]] and [[silver acetylide]]. Carbides of the [[actinides|actinide elements]], which have stoichiometry MC&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and M&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, are also described as salt-like derivatives of {{chem|C|2|2−}}.

The C-C triple bond length ranges from 119.2 pm in CaC&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (similar to ethyne), to 130.3 pm in [[lanthanum carbide|LaC&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] and 134 pm in [[uranium carbide|UC&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]]. The bonding in [[lanthanum carbide|LaC&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] has been described in terms of La&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt; with the extra electron delocalised into the antibonding orbital on {{chem|C|2|2−}}, explaining the metallic conduction.&lt;ref name="Greenwood" /&gt;

===Sesquicarbides===
The [[polyatomic ion]] {{chem|C|3|4−}}, sometimes called '''sesquicarbide''' or '''allylenide''', is found in Li&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and Mg&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. The ion is linear and is isoelectronic with CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name="Greenwood" /&gt; The C-C distance in Mg&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; is 133.2 pm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Crystal Structure of Magnesium Sesquicarbide|doi=10.1021/ic00041a018|author1=Fjellvag H. |author2=Pavel K. |journal=Inorg. Chem. |year=1992|volume=31|page=3260|issue=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mg&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; yields [[methylacetylene]], CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CCH, and [[propadiene]], CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CCH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, on hydrolysis, which was the first indication that it contains {{chem|C|3|4−}}.

==Covalent carbides==
The carbides of silicon and boron are described as "covalent carbides", although virtually all compounds of carbon exhibit some covalent character. [[Silicon carbide]] has two similar crystalline forms, which are both related to the diamond structure.&lt;ref name="Greenwood" /&gt; [[Boron carbide]], B&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;C, on the other hand, has an unusual structure which includes icosahedral boron units linked by carbon atoms. In this respect [[boron carbide]] is similar to the boron rich [[boride]]s. Both silicon carbide (also known as ''carborundum'') and boron carbide are very hard materials and [[refractory]]. Both materials are important industrially. Boron also forms other covalent carbides, e.g. B&lt;sub&gt;25&lt;/sub&gt;C.

==Interstitial carbides==
[[Image:Tungsten carbide.jpg|thumb|[[Tungsten carbide]] end mills.]]
The carbides of the group 4, 5 and 6 transition metals (with the exception of chromium) are often described as [[interstitial compound]]s.&lt;ref name="Greenwood" /&gt; These carbides have metallic properties and are [[refractory]]. Some exhibit a range of [[stoichiometries]], e.g. [[titanium carbide]], TiC. [[Titanium carbide]] and [[tungsten carbide]] are important industrially and are used to coat metals in cutting tools.&lt;ref name="Ettmayer"&gt;{{cite book|chapter=Carbides: transition metal solid state chemistry|author1=Peter Ettmayer |author2=Walter Lengauer |title=Encyclopedia of Inorganic Chemistry| editor=R. Bruce King |year=1994 |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=0-471-93620-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The long-held view is that the carbon atoms fit into octahedral interstices in a close-packed metal lattice when the metal atom radius is greater than approximately 135 pm:&lt;ref name="Greenwood" /&gt;
*When the metal atoms are [[close-packing|cubic close-packed]], (ccp), then filling all of the octahedral interstices with carbon achieves 1:1 stoichiometry with the rock salt structure.
*When the metal atoms are [[close-packing|hexagonal close-packed]], (hcp), as the octahedral interstices lie directly opposite each other on either side of the layer of metal atoms, filling only one of these with carbon achieves 2:1 stoichiometry with the CdI&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; structure.

The following table&lt;ref name="Greenwood" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ettmayer" /&gt; shows actual structures of the metals and their carbides. (N.B. the body centered cubic structure adopted by vanadium, niobium, tantalum, chromium, molybdenum and tungsten is not a close-packed lattice.) The notation "h/2" refers to the M&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C type structure described above, which is only an approximate description of the actual structures. The simple view that the lattice of the pure metal "absorbs" carbon atoms can be seen to be untrue as the packing of the metal atom lattice in the carbides is different from the packing in the pure metal, although it is technically correct that the carbon atoms fit into the octahedral interstices of a close-packed metal lattice.

For a long time the [[non-stoichiometric]] phases were believed to be disordered with a random filling of the interstices, however short and longer range ordering has been detected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Order and disorder in transition metal carbides and nitrides: experimental and theoretical aspects|author1=C.H. de Novion |author2=J.P. Landesman |journal=Pure Appl. Chem.|volume=57|issue=10|year=1985|page=1391|doi=10.1351/pac198557101391}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Intermediate transition metal carbides==
In these carbides, the transition metal ion is smaller than the critical 135 pm, and the structures are not interstitial but are more complex. Multiple stoichiometries are common; for example, iron forms a number of carbides, Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C, Fe&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C. The best known is [[cementite]], Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C, which is present in steels.
These carbides are more reactive than the interstitial carbides; for example, the carbides of Cr, Mn, Fe, Co and Ni are all hydrolysed by dilute acids and sometimes by water, to give a mixture of hydrogen and hydrocarbons. These compounds share features with both the inert interstitials and the more reactive salt-like carbides.&lt;ref name="Greenwood" /&gt;

==Molecular carbides==
[[Image:Au6C(PPh3)6.png|thumb|right|The complex [Au&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;C(PPh&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, containing a carbon-gold core.]]
Metal complexes containing C are known as [[metal carbido complex]]es. Most common are carbon-centered octahedral clusters, such as [Au&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;C(PPh&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and [Fe&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;C(CO)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt;.  Similar species are known for the [[metal carbonyl]]s and the early metal halides. A few terminal carbides have been isolated, e.g., CRuCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(P(C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

[[Metallocarbohedryne]]s (or "met-cars") are stable clusters with the general formula {{chem|M|8|C|12}} where M is a transition metal (Ti, Zr, V, etc.).

==Impossible carbides==
Some metals, such as [[lead]] and [[tin]], are believed not to form carbides under any circumstances.&lt;ref name="percy"&gt;{{cite book|author=[[John Percy (metallurgist)|John Percy]]|page=67|year=1870|url=https://archive.org/stream/metallurgyleadi01percgoog#page/n86/mode/2up/ |title=The Metallurgy of Lead, including Desiverization and Cupellation|publisher= J. Murray|place=London|accessdate=2013-04-06}}
&lt;/ref&gt; There exists however a mixed titanium-tin carbide, which is a two-dimensional conductor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Y. C. Zhou |author2=H. Y. Dong |author3=B. H. Yu |year=2000|title=Development of two-dimensional titanium tin carbide (Ti2SnC) plates based on the electronic structure investigation|journal=Materials Research Innovations |volume=4|issue=1|pages=36–41|doi=10.1007/s100190000065}}&lt;/ref&gt; (In 2007, there were two reports of a [[lead carbide]] PbC&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, apparently of the acetylide type; but these claims have yet to be published in reviewed journals.){{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

==Related materials==
In addition to the carbides, other groups of related carbon compounds exist:&lt;ref name="Greenwood" /&gt;
*[[graphite intercalation compound]]s
*alkali metal [[fullerides]]
*[[endohedral fullerenes]], where the metal atom is encapsulated within a fullerene molecule

'''''Chernobyl: Consequences of the Catastrophe for People and the Environment''''' is a translation of a 2007 Russian publication by [[:ru:Яблоков, Алексей Владимирович|Alexey V. Yablokov]], [[Vassili Nesterenko|Vassily B. Nesterenko]], and Alexey V. Nesterenko, [[consulting editor|edited]] by [[Radiation and Public Health Project|Janette D. Sherman-Nevinger]], and originally published by the [[New York Academy of Sciences]] in 2009 in their ''Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences'' series.&lt;ref name="Alexey2009"&gt;{{cite web|title=Chernobyl: Consequences of the Catastrophe for People and the Environment|url=http://www.nyas.org/publications/annals/Detail.aspx?cid=f3f3bd16-51ba-4d7b-a086-753f44b3bfc1|work=Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences|publisher=Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences|accessdate=15 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book presents an analysis of scientific literature and concludes that medical records between 1986, the year of the [[Chernobyl disaster]], and 2004 reflect 985,000 premature deaths as a result of the radioactivity released. The literature analysis draws on over 1,000 published titles and over 5,000 internet and printed publications, primarily in Slavic languages (i.e. not translated in English), discussing the consequences of the [[Chernobyl disaster]]. 

The book was not [[peer review]]ed by the [[New York Academy of Sciences]].&lt;ref name="Braaten"&gt;

The primary author, the biologist Alexey V. Yablokov, was a member of the [[Russian Academy of Science]]. Consulting editor, Janette Sherman, MD, has researched the health effects of [[nuclear radiation]] and illnesses such as [[cancer]] and [[birth defects]].

==Authors==
The primary author, the late biologist Alexey V. Yablokov, was a member of the [[Russian Academy of Science]], and was deputy chair of the commission of ecology of the USSR' Parliament (1989-1991), councillor on ecology and public health to the President of the Russian Federation (1991-1993) and chair of the state commission on dumping of radioactive wastes in seas surrounding the Russian Federation (1992-1993).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.chernobylcongress.org/speakers.html&lt;/ref&gt; He is also a co-founder of [[Greenpeace]] Russia.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.earthisland.org/journal/index.php/eij/article/center_for_safe_energy2/&lt;/ref&gt; From 1977 to 1987, the late Prof. [[Vassili Nesterenko|Vassily B. Nesterenko]] was the director of the Institute of Nuclear Energy at the [[National Academy of Sciences of Belarus]]. The foreword of the book is authored by Dimitro M. Grodzinsky, chairman of the Ukrainian National Commission on Radiation Protection and chairman of the Department of General Biology at the Ukrainian National Academy of Sciences. Consulting editor, Janette Sherman, MD, has a background in medicine and toxicology, with special reference to the health effects of [[nuclear radiation]] and illnesses such as [[cancer]] and [[birth defects]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://janettesherman.com/about/ Janette Sherman]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Themes==
The book presents an analysis of scientific literature and concludes that medical records between 1986, the year of the [[Chernobyl disaster]], and 2004 reflect 985,000 premature deaths as a result of the radioactivity released. The authors suggest that most of the deaths were in Russia, Belarus and Ukraine, though others occurred worldwide throughout the many countries that were struck by [[Nuclear fallout|radioactive fallout]] from Chernobyl.&lt;ref name="Alexey2009"/&gt; The literature analysis draws on over 1,000 published titles and over 5,000 internet and printed publications, primarily in Slavic languages (i.e. not translated in English), discussing the consequences of the Chernobyl disaster. The authors contend that those publications and papers were written by leading Eastern European authorities and have largely been downplayed or ignored by the [[International Atomic Energy Agency|IAEA]] and [[United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation|UNSCEAR]].  The claim was made, notwithstanding the fact that 13 of the authors of the Chernobyl Forum were from Ukraine, Russia or Belarus.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.who.int/ionizing_radiation/chernobyl/WHO%20Report%20on%20Chernobyl%20Health%20Effects%20July%2006.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Details|url=http://www.nyas.org/publications/annals/Detail.aspx?cid=f3f3bd16-51ba-4d7b-a086-753f44b3bfc1|work=Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences|publisher=Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences|accessdate=2011-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two expert reviews of the book were commissioned by the Oxford journal ''Radiation Protection Dosimetry''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://rpd.oxfordjournals.org/content/141/1/101.extract |title=Radiation Protection Dosimetry}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first, by Dr. [[Ian Fairlie]],&lt;ref name="Fairlie"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fairlie |first=Ian |year=2010 |url=http://wonkythinking.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/Fairlie-review.pdf |title=Chernobyl: Consequences of the catastrophe for people and the environment |journal=Radiation Protection Dosimetry |volume=141 |issue=1 |publisher=Oxford Journals |pages=97–101 |doi=10.1093/rpd/ncq180|pmc=2974725 }}&lt;/ref&gt; generally endorses the book's conclusions. Dr. Fairlie, a radiation biologist, was a scientific secretary to UK Government’s Committee Examining Radiation Risks from Internal Emitters &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.cerrie.org/# |title=Archived copy |access-date=2018-11-25 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130817012153/http://www.cerrie.org/# |archive-date=2013-08-17 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and one of two authors of the [[TORCH report]] commissioned by the [[European Green Party]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chernobylreport.org/?p=summary Torch: The Other Report On Chernobyl summary]&lt;/ref&gt; He greets the book as a
&lt;blockquote&gt;
''... welcome addition to the literature in English. The New York Academy of Sciences [is] to be congratulated for publishing this volume. [...] In the opinion of the reviewer, this volume makes it clear that international nuclear agencies and some national authorities remain in denial about the scale of the health disasters in their countries due to Chernobyl's fallout. This is shown by their reluctance to acknowledge contamination and health outcomes data, their ascribing observed morbidity/mortality increases to non-radiation causes, and their refusal to devote resources to rehabilitation and disaster management.''
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Fairlie notes two shortcomings of the book: that it does not sufficiently investigate the large decrease in average male life spans throughout Belarus, Russia and Ukraine, in both contaminated and uncontaminated areas; and that it does not make enough effort to reconstruct estimated doses of contamination and discuss their implications for eastern and western Europe (though Fairlie agrees with the authors that studies should not be rejected for failing to contain dose estimates—a criterion commonly applied by western nuclear agencies such as the [[International Atomic Energy Agency|IAEA]]).

[[File:Alexei Yablokov, Rosa Goncharova, Vassili Nesterenko.jpg|thumb|right|300px|[[Alexey Yablokov|Yablokov]] (left) and [[Vassili Nesterenko]] (farthest right) protesting in front of the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) headquarters in [[Geneva]], Switzerland in 2008.]]

Fairlie specifically concurs with Yablakov ''et al.'' on three points:

*The IAEA's exclusion of data where estimated dose is below a certain threshold (following [[International Commission on Radiological Protection|ICRP]] recommendations) is contrary to normal practice, even the ICRP's own practice, and contradicts the [[linear no-threshold model]] (LNT). The ICRP's recommendation in this regard is inconsistent with LNT and its own practices.
*The IAEA/[[World Health Organization|WHO]] have often sought to justify their dismissal of eastern European [[epidemiology|epidemiological]] studies by citing questionable scientific practices: but epidemiology is not an exact science, and the same shortcomings exist in western studies uncriticised by the IAEA. The IAEA also point to shortcomings with pre-Chernobyl Soviet cancer registries, but cancer registries in western countries had similar issues at that time.
*In observational epidemiological studies where certain data is already known and certain effects are expected, statistical tests for significance of the results are not normally required. Yet the IAEA has challenged such papers that do not include statistical tests and [[confidence interval]]s, and questioned whether the observed effects are due to chance. Eastern scientists are faced with a [[Catch-22 (logic)|catch-22]] situation whereby they either leave out statistical tests, and are dismissed, or else apply the tests, leading western scientists to conclude that there is no real effect.

The second review (in the same volume), by Dr. Monty Charles,&lt;ref name="Charles"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://wonkythinking.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/Charles-review.pdf |doi=10.1093/rpd/ncq185 |title=Chernobyl: consequences of the catastrophe for people and the environment (2010)  |first=Monty |last=Charles |year=2010 |volume=141 |issue=1 |journal=Radiation Protection Dosimetry |pages= 101–104|pmc=2974725 }}&lt;/ref&gt; is largely critical, noting several problems:
*The authors expressly discount socioeconomic or screening factors when considering increased occurrence of diseases, but this methodology does not seem to account for variations between territories prior to the accident.
*Their discussion of 'hot particle' poisoning is cursory, and is unclear regarding dosage figures.
*The chapter on health effects, 60% of the book, contains inadequate explanation or critical evaluation of many cited facts and figures, and in many instances related tables, figures and statements appear to contradict each other.
*A section abstract predicted numbers of casualties due to cancer, however the section did not contain any discussion to support these numbers.
While Charles agrees with the importance of making eastern research more available in the west, he states that he cannot tell which of the publications referred to by the book would sustain critical peer-review in western scientific literature, and that verifying these sources would require considerable effort. Charles sees the book as representing one end of a spectrum of views, and believes that works from the entire spectrum must be critically evaluated in order to develop an informed opinion.

A third review by Mona Dreicer was published in the journal Environmental Health Perspectives.&lt;ref name="Dreicer"&gt;{{cite journal|first=Mona|last=Dreicer|title=Book Review: Chernobyl: Consequences of the Catastrophe for People and the Environment|journal=Environmental Health Perspectives|year=2010|pages=a500|volume=118|doi=10.1289/ehp.118-a500|url=http://ehp03.niehs.nih.gov/article/fetchArticle.action?articleURI=info%3Adoi%2F10.1289%2Fehp.118-a500}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was highly critical of the book's methodology:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
''... by discounting the widely accepted scientific method for associating cause and effect (while taking into account the uncertainties of dose assessment and measurement of impacts), the authors leave us with only with their assertion that the data in this volume "document the true scale of the consequences of the Chernobyl catastrophe."''
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The New York Academy of Sciences published a fourth review, by M. I. Balonov of Institute of Radiation Hygiene, St. Petersburg, Russia. The reviewer condemned the book for completely discounting [[dosimetry]] and [[radiation dose reconstruction]], relying instead on inferior, simplistic methodologies, such as ecological and geographical techniques and tracking health indicators over time, which are known to give erroneous conclusions. He also noted the inexplicable selection of publications for analysis, which included media reports, websites of public organizations and even unidentified persons. At the same time, a lot of respected, peer-reviewed work from Russian-language authors was ignored.&lt;ref name = balonov&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.nyas.org/publications/annals/Detail.aspx?cid=f3f3bd16-51ba-4d7b-a086-753f44b3bfc1 | title = Review of Volume 1181 | author = M.

This erroneous approach resulted in […] a clear exaggeration of radiation-induced health effects."&lt;/ref&gt; Balonov's review concludes that the value of the report is negative, because it has very little scientific merit while being highly misleading to the lay reader. It also characterized the estimate of nearly a million deaths as more in the realm of science fiction than science.&lt;ref name=balonov/&gt;

[[Image:Dalahäst i avesta.jpg|right|thumb|300px|The world's largest Dalecarlian horse, made of [[concrete]] and located in [[Avesta Municipality|Avesta]], [[Sweden]].]]

A '''Dalecarlian horse''' or  '''Dala horse''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|d|ɑː|l|ə|ˈ|k|ɑːr|l|i|ə|n}};&lt;ref&gt;"Dalecarlia", ''Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary'', 2013, web: [http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/dalecarlia MWeb-Dal].&lt;/ref&gt; Swedish: '''Dalahäst''') is a traditional carved, painted wooden statue of a [[horse]] originating in the Swedish province of [[Dalarna]] (Dalecarlia). In the old days the Dalecarlian horse was mostly used as a toy for children; in modern times it has become a symbol of Dalarna, as well as of [[Sweden]] in general. Several different types of Dalecarlian horses are made, with distinguishing features common to the locality of the site where they are produced. One particular style has, however, become much more common and widespread than others. It is stoutly carved and painted bright red with details and a [[horse harness|harness]] in white, green, yellow and blue.

==History==

It was in the small log cabins deep in the forests during the long winter nights in front of a log fire that the forerunner of the Dala horse was born. Using simple tools, generally only a knife, woodcarvers made toys for their children. It was only natural that many of these toys were horses, because the horse was invaluable in those days, as a trusty friend and worker who could pull great loads of timber from the forests during the winter months, and in the summer could be of just as much use on the farm.

The art of carving and painting the small horses quickly flourished in the 19th century, as economic hardship in the region inspired greater production of the small horses, and they became an important item of [[barter]]. Horse-making may have started as something to do during the long dark winter months, but soon the Dala horses were traded in exchange for household goods and their carving and painting blossomed into a full-fledged cottage industry. The rural families depended on horse production to help keep food on the table, as the skills of horse carving and painting were passed on from generation to generation.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

[[Image:Dalecarlian horse.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.0|The wooden horses are painted in the ''[[kurbits]]'' style. This one from around 1950.]]
The carving of Dala horses as a livelihood is thought to have started in the village of [[Bergkarlås]] in central Sweden, though the nearby "horse" villages of [[Risa (Sweden)|Risa]], [[Vattnäs]], and [[Nusnäs]] were also centres of horse-making. The villages were involved in the art of furniture and clock-making, and it is likely the leftover scraps of wood were put to use in the production of Dala horses.&lt;ref&gt;''Art &amp; Technique of Scandinavian Style Woodcarving'' by Harley Refsal (2004) - Fox Chapel Publishing&lt;/ref&gt; Many early Dala horses were not painted at all, but in the beginning of the 19th century painting them in a single color, white or red, became common practice. The decoration of the Dala horse has its roots in furniture painting and was perfected over the years. According to a local tale, a wandering painter in the style of ''[[kurbits]]'' came across one of these Dala horses in a farm he was decorating. When asked by one of the children why that horse was not as beautifully painted as the ones in the decorations, he painted the Dala horse in the same style. This tradition was then carried on in order to raise the market value of the Dala horses.

The earliest references to wooden horses for sale are from 1623—nearly 400 years ago. In the 19th century, [[Stikå-Erik Hansson]] from the village Risa in the parish of [[Mora, Sweden|Mora]] introduced the technique of painting with two colours on the same brush, still used today. In the book "The Wooden Horses of Sweden," the author mentions that this famous Dala painter is buried in a small churchyard in Nebraska after having immigrated to the Midwest in 1887 at the age of 64.) He changed his name to Erik Erikson upon coming to America and is buried at Bega Cemetery in Stanton County Nebraska, outside of Norfolk.

While there were many horse whittlers in the early production of Dala horses, there were comparatively few horse painters. The large number of whittlers and a lack of distinguishing features makes it difficult to distinguish between different whittlers. Early painters very rarely signed their work, but they did have their own distinct pattern from which it is often possible to identify who painted a particular horse. In the 1930s (especially after the [[Exposition Internationale des Arts et Techniques dans la Vie Moderne (1937)|World's Expo in Paris 1937]] and [[1939 New York World's Fair|World's Fair in New York 1939]] in which Dala horses were shown) [[mass production]] of Dala horses started. This marks the beginning of a new era for the Dala horse, transitioning from toy to a national symbol and popular souvenir.

The Dalecarlian horse of today is still a handcrafted article, made of pine, and its pattern is about 150 years old. At least nine different people contribute their skills to create each horse. The distinctive shape of the horse is due to the usage of [[Scandinavian flat-plane style of woodcarving|flat-plane style carving]].

===Folklore===
An apocryphal legend of the Dalecarlian horse is that they became the national toy in 1716. According to the legend, soldiers loyal to [[Charles XII of Sweden|King Charles XII]] were quartered in the Dalecarlian region and carved the toys as gifts for their hosts.&lt;ref&gt;''Oddball Minnesota: A Guide to Some Really Strange Places'' by Jerome Pohlen (2003) - Chicago Review Press&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geographical differences==
[[Image:Rytter Olof Matsson Dala Horse.jpg|200px|right|thumb|alt=Rytter Olof Matsson Dala Horse|A Dala horse painted by Rytter Olof Matsson, Risa, around 1910.]]
Early production of Dala horses was concentrated to four villages: Bergkarlås, Risa, Vattnäs, and Nusnäs, all in the parish of Mora. Production is believed to have started in
Bergkarlås and later spread to nearby villages Risa and Vattnäs through kindred. At about the same time production started independently in Nusnäs, and being farther away their style was less influenced by those of the other villages. The individual painters each had their particular style, and the few who are old enough to remember first- or second-hand the history can often tell which village, and in some cases which carver or painter, turned out a particular horse. The distinguishing features of many early painters from these villages have now been documented.&lt;ref&gt;{{sv icon}} [http://www.dalahorse.info Dalahästen - en kulturskatt] (online encyclopedia of early carvers and painters)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{sv icon}} ''Dalahästen från Nusnäs, Sverigesymbolen'' by Ivar Johansson (2009) - Notdraget Lidingö&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of the works by the earliest horse makers are no longer in existence but those that remain are cherished by their owners and have often been passed down through generations. These are also coveted by collectors, and their value has risen markedly over the years.

Today, many of the villages in Dalarna county make Dala horses with individual styles representing the district of origin. These horses also have distinctive shapes and often come in different sizes. Some horses like the Nusnäs horse are stocky work horses; others are lean and upright with stately countenance like the [[Rättvik]] horse. Many of these can be seen at a yearly exhibition (since the year 2000), which is held at [[Klockargården]] in [[Leksand]], Sweden. Currently about forty present carvers and painters show their Dala horses and put them up for sale.

==Production==
Today, Nusnäs is the centre of Dala horse production with the most famous being the [[Nils Olsson]] and [[Grannas Olsson]] workshops. Grannas A. Olssons Hemslöjd AB, founded in 1922, is the oldest company which still makes Dalecarlian horses.  Nils Olssons Hemslöjd is almost as old. The horses made at these workshops share the same familiar pattern which most people associate to Dala horses. Apart from these, old-style horses are also hand-carved and painted in limited editions to replicate the style of the antique horses found in Swedish museums or held in private family collections. These are numbered and signed, so that they cannot be confused with an original early Dala horse.

The wood from which the figures are carved comes from the slow-growing pine forests around [[Siljan (lake)|Lake Siljan]]. The wood is ideal for carpentry and carving. The trees to be made into horses are marked out while still standing in the forest. Only the best timber will be selected for carving into horses. The trees are felled and sawed into pieces of a suitable size for the blanks that will eventually be made into Dalecarlian horses.

The blanks are sawed and carved by hand. Because of this, no two horses are exactly alike. The horses are dipped in primer immediately after carving, to reveal any defects in the wood that may need to be fixed. After priming, any cavities in the wood are filled in to ensure extra smoothness. The horses are polished to give them a smooth, attractive finish.

After sanding, the horses are dipped into paint of the appropriate colour. The traditional pattern is painted free-hand by practised "ripple" painters. The art of rippling requires great skill and takes many years to learn. Finally, "all the fine horses" are varnished and sent out from Nusnäs to serve as a symbol of Sweden in the outside world.

Dala horses were introduced to North America at the [[1939 World's Fair]] in New York.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Dalahästens Hemsida - Dalahästar hos Grannas A Olssons Hemslöjd AB|url = http://www.grannas.com/mainframe.php?page=1939|website = www.grannas.com|access-date = 2016-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The architects Sven Markelius and Anders Beckman chose the dala horse because they were searching for a powerful symbol for the Swedish pavilion at the fair. 

A similar dala horse can be seen in [[Andersonville, Chicago]], donated by the Swedish American Women's Educational Association (SWEA) to the [[Swedish American Museum]]. SWAE commissioned the Swedish Artist Lars Gillis to paint the dala horse in a way that represents the connection between Sweden and Chicago. After eight years, the original dala horse could not withstand the harsh Chicago weather conditions and was removed in 2013 for restoration that took a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Andersonville's Dala Horse Returns to the Neighborhood|url = https://www.dnainfo.com/chicago/20140206/andersonville/andersonvilles-dala-horse-returns-neighborhood|website = DNAinfo Chicago|access-date = 2016-01-25|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160130144352/https://www.dnainfo.com/chicago/20140206/andersonville/andersonvilles-dala-horse-returns-neighborhood|archivedate = 2016-01-30|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is now kept in the lobby of the Swedish American Museum, which provided a [[fiberglass]] replica placed on the corner of Clark and Farragut streets.

&lt;!-- Missing image removed: [[Image:Deborah Tabart Koala Woman.jpg|left|120px]] --&gt;

'''Deborah Tabart, [[Order of Australia|OAM]]''' is the CEO of the [[Australian Koala Foundation]]. She has worked with this organisation since 1988 and is known internationally as the Koala Woman.

==Career and Achievements==

In 1988, Deborah Tabart was asked by the Australian Koala Foundation Board of Directors to “raise funds to save the koala”. She quickly realised that the world of koala conservation was much more complicated than that. She faced a steep learning curve in the worlds of science, politics, development and conservation.

Under her guidance, the Australian Koala Foundation has grown from a fledgling group of koala advocates into an award-winning, international scientific organisation that has funded millions of dollars worth of research and conservation.

In January 2008, Tabart was awarded the [[Medal of the Order of Australia]] (OAM) in acknowledgement of her contributions to the protection and management koalas and their habitat, and her service to Australia and humanity.

She has led the Australian Koala Foundation in its key achievements of the [https://www.savethekoala.com/kha.html Koala Habitat Atlas] and [https://www.savethekoala.com/koalabeach.html Koala Beach], and is currently formulating a National Koala Act in the hope of legislating protection for koala habitat.

Deborah Tabart now resides in Queensland, Australia. Besides her day job at the AKF, she also practices permaculture and grows her own vegetables.

In [[physics]], the '''electronvolt'''&lt;ref&gt;[http://goldbook.iupac.org/E02014.html IUPAC Gold Book] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090103024844/http://goldbook.iupac.org/E02014.html |date=2009-01-03 }}, p. 75&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bipm.org/en/si/si_brochure/chapter4/table7.html ''SI brochure''], Sec. 4.1 Table 7 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120716204133/http://www.bipm.org/en/si/si_brochure/chapter4/table7.html |date=July 16, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (symbol '''eV''', also written '''electron-volt''' and '''electron volt''') is a [[Units of energy|unit of energy]] equal to approximately {{val|1.6|e=-19}} [[joule]]s (symbol J) in [[International System of Units|SI units]]. 



Historically, the electronvolt was devised as a standard unit of measure through its usefulness in [[Particle accelerator#Electrostatic particle accelerators|electrostatic particle accelerator]] sciences, because a particle with charge ''q'' has an energy {{nowrap|1=''E'' = ''qV''}} after passing through the potential ''V''; if ''q'' is quoted in integer units of the elementary charge and the terminal bias in volts, one gets an energy in eV.

Like the elementary charge on which it is based, it is not an independent quantity but is equal to {{nowrap|1 {{sfrac|J|C}} {{sqrt|2[[Planck constant|''h'']][[fine structure constant|''α'']] / [[magnetic constant|''μ''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;]][[speed of light|''c''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;]]}}}}. It is a common [[unit of energy]] within physics, widely used in [[Solid-state physics|solid state]], [[Atomic physics|atomic]], [[Nuclear physics|nuclear]], and [[particle physics]]. It is commonly used with the [[metric prefix]]es milli-, kilo-, mega-, giga-, tera-, peta- or exa- (meV, keV, MeV, GeV, TeV, PeV and EeV respectively). In some older documents, and in the name [[Bevatron]], the symbol BeV is used, which stands for [[billion]] (10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;) electronvolts; it is equivalent to the GeV.

==Definition==
An electronvolt is the amount of energy gained (or lost) by the charge of a single [[electron]] moving across an [[Voltage|electric potential difference]] of one [[volt]]. Hence, it has a value of one [[volt]], {{val|1|u=J/C}}, multiplied by the electron's [[elementary charge]] ''e'', {{physconst|e|after=.}} Therefore, one electronvolt is equal to {{physconst|eV|after=.}} The electronvolt is not an [[International System of Units|SI unit]], and its definition is [[Empiricism|empirical]] (unlike the [[litre]], the [[light-year]] and other such non-SI units), where its value in SI units must be obtained experimentally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 | accessdate=2018-07-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mass==
By [[mass–energy equivalence]], the electronvolt is also a unit of [[mass]]. It is common in [[particle physics]], where units of mass and energy are often interchanged, to express mass in units of eV/''c''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, where ''c'' is the [[speed of light]] in vacuum (from [[Mass–energy equivalence|{{nowrap|1=''E'' = ''mc''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}]]). It is common to simply express mass in terms of "eV" as a [[unit of mass]], effectively using a system of [[natural units]] with ''c'' set to 1.&lt;ref&gt;Barrow, J. D. "Natural Units Before Planck." Quarterly Journal of the Royal Astronomical Society 24 (1983): 24.&lt;/ref&gt; The mass equivalent of {{val|1|u=eV/c2}} is

:&lt;math&gt;1\; \text{eV}/c^{2} = \frac{(1.60217646 \times 10^{-19} \; \text{C}) \cdot 1 \; \text{V}}{(2.99792458 \times 10^{8}\; \text{m}/\text{s})^2} = 1.783 \times 10^{-36}\; \text{kg}.&lt;/math&gt;

For example, an electron and a [[positron]], each with a mass of {{val|0.511|u=MeV/c2}}, can [[Annihilation|annihilate]] to yield {{val|1.022|u=MeV}} of energy. The [[proton]] has a mass of {{val|0.938|u=GeV/c2}}. In general, the masses of all [[hadron]]s are of the order of {{val|1|u=GeV/c2}}, which makes the GeV (gigaelectronvolt) a convenient unit of mass for particle physics:
:{{val|1|u=GeV/c2}}&amp;nbsp;= {{val|1.783|e=-27|u=kg}}.

The [[unified atomic mass unit]] (u), 1&amp;nbsp;gram divided by [[Avogadro's number]], is almost the mass of a [[hydrogen atom]], which is mostly the mass of the proton. To convert to megaelectronvolts, use the formula:

:1&amp;nbsp;u&amp;nbsp;= {{val|931.4941|u=MeV/c2}}&amp;nbsp;= {{val|0.9314941|u=GeV/c2}}.

==Momentum==
In [[Particle physics|high-energy physics]], the electronvolt is often used as a unit of [[momentum]]. A potential difference of 1&amp;nbsp;volt causes an electron to gain an amount of energy (i.e., {{val|1|u=eV}}). This gives rise to usage of eV (and keV, MeV, GeV or TeV) as units of momentum, for the energy supplied results in acceleration of the particle.

The dimensions of momentum units are {{dimanalysis|length=1|mass=1|time=−1}}. The dimensions of energy units are {{dimanalysis|length=2|mass=1|time=−2}}. Then, dividing the units of energy (such as eV) by a fundamental constant that has units of velocity ({{dimanalysis|length=1|time=−1}}), facilitates the required conversion of using energy units to describe momentum. In the field of high-energy particle physics, the fundamental velocity unit is the speed of light in vacuum ''c''. 

By dividing energy in eV by the speed of light, one can describe the momentum of an electron in units of eV/''c''.&lt;ref name="FNALunits"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://quarknet.fnal.gov/toolkits/ati/whatgevs.html |title=Units in particle physics |publisher=Fermilab |date=22 March 2002 |work=Associate Teacher Institute Toolkit |accessdate=13 February 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514152552/http://quarknet.fnal.gov/toolkits/ati/whatgevs.html |archivedate=14 May 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name="SLACunits"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www2.slac.stanford.edu/vvc/theory/relativity.html |title=Special Relativity |publisher=SLAC |date=15 June 2009 |work=Virtual Visitor Center |accessdate=13 February 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fundamental velocity constant ''c'' is often ''dropped'' from the units of momentum by way of defining units of length such that the value of ''c'' is unity. For example, if the momentum ''p'' of an electron is said to be {{val|1|u=GeV}}, then the conversion to MKS can be achieved by:

:&lt;math&gt;p = 1\; \text{GeV}/c = \frac{(1 \times 10^{9}) \cdot (1.60217646 \times 10^{-19} \; \text{C}) \cdot (1 \; \text{V})}{(2.99792458 \times 10^{8}\; \text{m}/\text{s})} = 5.344286 \times 10^{-19}\; \text{kg} \cdot \text{m}/\text{s}.&lt;/math&gt;

==Distance==
In [[particle physics]], a system of "natural units" in which the speed of light in vacuum ''c'' and the [[Planck constant|reduced Planck constant]] ''ħ'' are dimensionless and equal to unity is widely used: {{nowrap|1=''c'' = ''ħ'' = 1}}. In these units, both distances and times are expressed in inverse energy units (while energy and mass are expressed in the same units, see [[mass–energy equivalence]]). In particular, particle [[scattering length]]s are often presented in units of inverse particle masses.

Outside this system of units, the conversion factors between electronvolt, second, and nanometer are the following:
:&lt;math&gt;\hbar = {{h}\over{2\pi}} = 1.054\ 571\ 726(47)\times 10^{-34}\ \mbox{J s} = 6.582\ 119\ 28(15)\times 10^{-16}\ \mbox{eV s}.&lt;/math&gt;

The above relations also allow expressing the [[mean lifetime]] ''τ'' of an unstable particle (in seconds) in terms of its [[decay width]] ''Γ'' (in eV) via {{nowrap|1=''Γ'' = ''ħ''/''τ''}}. For example, the [[B meson|B&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; meson]] has a lifetime of 1.530(9)&amp;nbsp;[[picosecond]]s, mean decay length is {{nowrap|1=''cτ'' = {{val|459.7|u=µm}}}}, or a decay width of {{val|4.302|25|e=-4|u=eV}}.

Conversely, the tiny meson mass differences responsible for [[Neutral particle oscillation|meson oscillations]] are often expressed in the more convenient inverse picoseconds.

Energy in electronvolts is sometimes expressed through the wavelength of light with photons of the same energy: 1 eV = 8065.544005(49) cm&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;. &lt;!-- calculation 1/hc --&gt;

==Temperature==
In certain fields, such as [[plasma physics]], it is convenient to use the electronvolt as a unit of temperature. The conversion to the [[Kelvin scale]] is defined by using ''k''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;, the [[Boltzmann constant]]:

:&lt;math&gt;{1 \over k_{\text{B}}} = {1.602\,176\,53(14) \times 10^{-19} \text{ J/eV} \over 1.380\,6505(24) \times 10^{-23} \text{ J/K}} = 11\,604.505(20) \text{ K/eV}.&lt;/math&gt;

For example, a typical [[magnetic confinement fusion]] plasma is {{val|15|u=keV}}, or 170&amp;nbsp;MK.

As an approximation: ''k''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;''T'' is about {{val|0.025|u=eV}} (≈ {{sfrac|290 K|11604 K/eV}}) at a temperature of {{val|20|u=degC}}.

==Properties==
[[File:Colors in eV.svg|thumb|Energy of photons in the visible spectrum in eV|239x239px]]
[[File:EV to nm vis.png|thumb|Graph of wavelength (nm) to energy (eV)]]
The energy ''E'', frequency ''v'', and wavelength λ of a photon are related by

:&lt;math&gt;E=h\nu=\frac{hc}{\lambda}&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;=\frac{(4.13566\,7516\times 10^{-15}\,\mbox{eV}\,\mbox{s})(299\,792\,458\,\mbox{m/s})}{\lambda}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''h'' is the [[Planck constant]], ''c'' is the [[speed of light]]. This reduces to

:&lt;math&gt;E\mbox{(eV)}=4.13566\,7516\,\mbox{feVs}\cdot\nu\ \mbox{(PHz)}&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;=\frac{1\,239.84193\,\mbox{eV}\,\mbox{nm}}{\lambda\ \mbox{(nm)}}.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CODATA Value: Planck constant in eV s|url=http://physics.nist.gov/cgi-bin/cuu/Value?hev|accessdate=30 March 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150122120538/http://physics.nist.gov/cgi-bin/cuu/Value?hev|archivedate=22 January 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A photon with a wavelength of {{val|532|u=nm}} (green light) would have an energy of approximately {{val|2.33|u=eV}}. Similarly, {{val|1|u=eV}} would correspond to an infrared photon of wavelength {{val|1240|u=nm}} or frequency {{val|241.8|u=THz}}.

==Scattering experiments==
In a low-energy nuclear scattering experiment, it is conventional to refer to the nuclear recoil energy in units of eVr, keVr, etc. This distinguishes the nuclear recoil energy from the "electron equivalent" recoil energy (eVee, keVee, etc.) measured by [[Scintillation (physics)|scintillation]] light. For example, the yield of a [[phototube]] is measured in phe/keVee ([[photoelectron]]s per keV electron-equivalent energy). The relationship between eV, eVr, and eVee depends on the medium the scattering takes place in, and must be established empirically for each material.

==Energy comparisons==
[[File:Light spectrum.svg|right|frame|'''Photon frequency vs. energy particle in electronvolts'''. The [[photon energy|energy of a photon]] varies only with the frequency of the photon, related by speed of light constant. This contrasts with a massive particle of which the energy depends on its velocity and [[rest mass]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://cbst.ucdavis.edu/education/courses/winter-2006-IST8A/ist8a_2006_01_09light.pdf What is Light?] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131205005843/http://cbst.ucdavis.edu/education/courses/winter-2006-IST8A/ist8a_2006_01_09light.pdf |date=December 5, 2013 }} – [[UC Davis]] lecture slides&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Elert, Glenn |url=http://physics.info/em-spectrum/ |title=Electromagnetic Spectrum, The Physics Hypertextbook |publisher=hypertextbook.com |accessdate=2016-07-30 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160729235315/http://physics.info/em-spectrum/ |archivedate=2016-07-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vlf.it/frequency/bands.html |title=Definition of frequency bands on |publisher=Vlf.it |accessdate=2010-10-16 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100430012219/http://www.vlf.it/frequency/bands.html |archivedate=2010-04-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''FLiNaK''' is the name of the ternary [[eutectic]] [[alkaline metal]] [[fluoride]] [[salt (chemistry)|salt]] mixture [[Lithium fluoride|LiF]]-[[Sodium fluoride|NaF]]-[[Potassium fluoride|KF]] (46.5-11.5-42&amp;nbsp;mol %).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.energyfromthorium.com/pdf/FFR_chap12.pdf Lane, James A.

It is used as [[electrolyte]] for the [[electroplating]] of [[refractory metals]] and compounds like [[titanium]], [[tantalum]], [[hafnium]], [[zirconium]] and their [[boride]]s.  FLiNaK also could see potential use as a coolant in the [[very high temperature reactor]], a type of nuclear reactor.

==Coolant==
FLiNaK salt was researched heavily during the late 1950s by [[Oak Ridge National Laboratory]] as potential candidate for a coolant in the [[molten salt reactor]] because of its low melting point, its high heat capacity, and its chemical stability at high temperatures.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.energyfromthorium.com/pdf/FFR_chap12.pdf Lane, James A. "Chemical Aspects of Molten Fluoride Salt Reactor Fuels." Fluid Fuel Reactors. Reading, MA: Addison-Wesley Pub., 1958.&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately, its sister salt, [[FLiBe]], was  chosen as the solvent salt for the molten salt reactor due to a more desirable nuclear cross section.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.energyfromthorium.com/pdf/FFR_chap12.pdf Lane, James A. Fluid Fuel Reactors. Reading, MA: Addison-Wesley Pub, 1958, p. 574&lt;/ref&gt;  FLiNaK still gathers interest as an intermediate coolant for a high-temperature molten salt reactor where it could transfer heat without being in the presence of the fuel.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, D. F. (2006). [http://nuclear.inl.gov/deliverables/docs/ornl-tm-2006-69_htl_salt.pdf Assessment of candidate molten salt coolants for the NGNP/NHI Heat-Transfer Loop]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Molten Flinak Salt.JPG|thumb|Molten FLiNaK salt in a test tube heated by a natural gas flame.]]

==Chemistry==
Fluoride salts, like all [[salts]], cause corrosion in most metals and alloys. FliNak is different from FLiBe in the sense that is a basic melt—or it has an excess of fluorine ions.  As FLiNak melts, all three components are alkali fluorides and therefore disassociate into positive and negative ions.  The concentration of molten fluorine ions are able to corrode any metallic structures if it is energetically favorable.  This is in contrast to FLiBe, which in a 66-34&amp;nbsp;mol% mixture will be a chemically neutral mix, as fluorine ions from LiF are donated to BeF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to create the [[tetrafluoroberyllate]] ion BeF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13706">'''Foreign Reports Inc.''' is a Washington, D.C.-based consulting firm for the oil industry, founded in 1956. [http://www.foreignreports.com/ Foreign Reports] advises energy companies, governments, and financial institutions on world energy issues, with a specialization on the [[Middle East]]. The [http://www.foreignreports.com/resume.html President] of the firm is [[Nathaniel Kern]].

==Overview==

[http://www.foreignreports.com/aboutus.html Foreign Reports Inc.] has been in this business for more than 50 years and counts among its subscribers many of the world’s largest oil companies—both international and national—as well as many other financial institutions. It reports on political developments that are highly relevant to [[oil markets]], crude [[oil price]] formation, and related [[macroeconomic]] variables.

==Methods==

In providing political intelligence and analysis of world oil markets, [http://www.foreignreports.com/ Foreign Reports] uses three simple tools:
*''Focus'': Its Reports focus on political questions that impact oil markets. They are brief (rarely more than two pages), single-topic reports and are transmitted three to five times a week to its clients. They filter out the mass of extraneous intelligence which accumulates every day in today's world.
*''Facts'': The Reports do more than focus on what is truly relevant; they are also the product of intensive efforts to go to difficult-to-access sources to find out what political decisions are being made and why they are being made. Sources are more comfortable and more open in talking with Foreign Reports because they know that their identities will be protected and that the information they provide will receive highly limited circulation.
*''Analysis'': Frequently the focus and the facts are not enough to predict uncertain outcomes. Foreign Reports uses its expertise and experience in world oil markets to create a focused product that is relevant to these markets.

==History==

[http://www.foreignreports.com/fr-history.html Foreign Reports Inc.] was founded in 1956 by Harry Kern, who had previously been Foreign Editor of [[Newsweek]], in which capacity he traveled extensively throughout the world, but especially in the Far and Middle East.

[[Newsweek]] and [[Time Magazine]] during that period were practically the sole elements of the U.S. news media reporting on world activities in a timely fashion. As [http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,856017,00.html Foreign Editor], Harry Kern also was Editor-in-Chief of the magazine’s International Edition and thus had the privilege of picking who or what would adorn the cover of those editions. Since various foreign leaders, or aspiring ones, angled to get their pictures on the front of [[Newsweek]], Kern was a popular visitor in many foreign capitals. In the process, he managed to befriend both current and future leaders and to gain insights into how their policies were developed.

[http://www.foreignreports.com/ Foreign Reports] grew out of these unique circumstances, as Kern saw a need among growing multinational companies with sizable stakes around the world for a level of international political reporting that surpassed what was then being carried in the daily newspapers of the period. From [[Newsweek]], he brought with him to [http://www.foreignreports.com/ Foreign Reports] two bureau chiefs, one in [[Beirut]] and one in [[Tokyo]]. From these "bureaus" of [http://www.foreignreports.com/ Foreign Reports] came a steady stream of insightful reporting on the regions they covered. Among its initial major subscribers were the world’s major oil companies, but also other industrial and banking concerns.

==Oil Crises==

In the year of its founding, [http://www.foreignreports.com/fr-history.html Foreign Reports] benefited from one of the first “[[1973 oil crisis|oil crises]]” that have afflicted the Middle East over the years—the 1956 [[Suez Crisis]], with its concomitant closure of the [[Suez Canal]], which was a great boon to notable tanker owners of the time, who were avid clients of Foreign Reports.

Since that time, [http://www.foreignreports.com/ Foreign Reports] has closely covered for its subscribers all the major and minor crises that have bedeviled world [[oil markets]] ever since, as well as the broad geopolitical trends that have affected markets and business conditions. The methods it uses to anticipate the unanticipated are relatively straightforward and avoid being unduly alarmist. They are methods that have been refined over time.

Most every crisis begins with a series of rumbles, and the rumbles have to be distinguished from mere bluster and bombast. Knowing who the players are, how they think, what they confide in others, their history of risk-taking and their own domestic political requirements is essential. As any potential crisis builds, often over a period of months, [http://www.foreignreports.com/ Foreign Reports] writes up a contemporaneous narrative, covering the story as it develops, often focusing on key details, which, only later, historians pick up on and piece together.

==Foreign Reports and the Middle East==

The [[Middle East]], with its vast reserves of [[petroleum]], was an obvious early focus of [http://www.foreignreports.com/ Foreign Reports], especially as the firm’s subscribers had substantial equity interests in [[oil concessions]] in that volatile part of the world, where [[Harry Kern|Kern]] remained a frequent visitor to many of the key players—the [[Shah]] of [[Iran]], [[Gamal Abdul Nasser]] of revolutionary [[Egypt]], [[Crown Prince Faisal of Saudi Arabia]], etc. Kern also maintained close relationships with the leading foreign policy actors in the Eisenhower Administration, notably Secretary of State [[John Foster Dulles]] and his brother, CIA Director [[Allen Dulles]], forging a long relationship with U.S. intelligence, both in Washington and in the Agency’s foreign “stations.”

[[Nathaniel Kern]] (also [[Nat Kern]]) joined his father at Foreign Reports in 1972 after graduating from [[Princeton University]] and attending the University of Riyadh from 1970-71 as the first non-Arab student. By the time he graduated and joined the firm, rumblings of the first full-scale “[[energy crisis]]” had begun and the role of [[Saudi Arabia]] on the world scene began to be transformed.

Within two years of Nat's joining the firm, the world of oil and the [[Middle East]] had changed dramatically, with prices skyrocketing and the [[volumes of crude oil]] being produced in [[Saudi Arabia]] growing steadily. The firm’s business branched out from providing political reporting on [[oil in the Middle East]] into also providing business development assistance to firms wishing to break into new markets in the [[Middle East]], primarily, though not exclusively, in [[Saudi Arabia]]. The main areas the firm concentrated in were competitive bidding opportunities in the power and [[desalination]] markets. This required an understanding of the technologies, engineering and procurement issues inherent in complex projects, and Foreign Reports brought on board the necessary skilled individuals in these areas.

[[Nat Kern]] was a frequent visitor to [[Iraq]] during the 1980-1988 [[Iran-Iraq war]], at a time when [[U.S.-Iraqi relations]] were improving, and was tasked by the [[U.S. government]] with maintaining ties with certain key Iraqi officials from 1991 onwards, at a time when the [[U.S. government]] maintained a policy of shunning any official contact with the [[Iraqi government]].

==Changing Realities of the Oil Market==

By the early 1980s, the nature of the world oil business began to change in a number of different ways, all of which affected how [http://www.foreignreports.com/ Foreign Reports] would be able to continue to provide services to its client base. The major international oil companies were gradually losing their equity ownership of [[Middle East oil]] production and many needed to forge different kinds of relationships with producing governments. In addition, a new class of players in the oil market was gradually emerging as interest and liquidity grew in the futures market. World oil prices had been practically a secret in the early days of [http://www.foreignreports.com/ Foreign Reports] and had been remarkably stable in general during the firm’s first 16 years, but it would be another ten years before price volatility would become a major reason for the firm to develop another service for its clients.

[[OPEC]] did not institute its first quotas until 1982, just as crude oil prices were beginning to come under downward pressure in the market. When prices did eventually start to crash in late November 1985, no other reporting service in the industry had so closely chronicled how that crash would materialize as [http://www.foreignreports.com/ Foreign Reports] had done. The firm had watched intensely how then Saudi Petroleum Minister [[Ahmed Zaki Yamani]] had wrestled over new ways to price [[Saudi Arabia’s oil]] as he cruised the Mediterranean on his yacht during August 1985. [http://www.foreignreports.com/ Foreign Reports] was the first to report that Yamani, just before that Labor Day, had got off his yacht and signed [[“net-back pricing deals”]] with his main international customers. These deals that would cut all previous supports for crude [[oil prices]] and lead prices from the high $20s to the single digits within nine months. Incredibly, in those early days of the [[NYMEX]], futures prices did not start to decline until the day after Thanksgiving.

As the pace and sophistication of [[NYMEX]] trading has accelerated greatly since those days, and as access to the incredible amounts of information over the internet has exploded, the services that [http://www.foreignreports.com/ Foreign Reports] has offered have also changed, while still staying with time-tested methods: follow the narrative; know the actors; know their characters; understand the rules; understand cultures and histories; pay ever increasing attention to separating the wheat from the chaff in an information-laden age; and communicate concisely and clearly.

==Current work==

[http://www.foreignreports.com/ Foreign Reports] continues to report on political developments that are highly relevant to [[oil markets]], crude [[oil price]] formation, and related [[macroeconomic]] variables. It closely monitors and reports on the political and economic situations in places such as: [[Iraq]], [[Iran]], [[Saudi Arabia]], [[Nigeria]], and [[Venezuela]]. The firm also reports on [[OPEC politics]] and examines what [[oil production]] decisions might be looming in the near future. [[Executive (government)|Executive]] and [[legislative]] activities in the U.S. which affect [[world oil markets]] are also often reported on.

* '''Iraq:''' Many of the world's major [[oil companies]] currently rely on [http://www.foreignreports.com/ Foreign Reports] for their understanding of Iraq's political events, the status of its [[oil industry]], and the broad trends which appear to be shaping the future of the country. With the security situation in Iraq not yet suitable for [[international oil companies]] to have much of a physical presence there, and because Western news agencies have a limited number of journalists stationed throughout the country, many energy companies, governments, and financial institutions rely extensively on the political reporting and analysis done by [http://www.foreignreports.com/ Foreign Reports].
* '''Iran:''' The political and economic events in Iran are often discussed, yet rarely understood. [http://www.foreignreports.com/ Foreign Reports] has shown an ability to look beyond the bluster and bombast coming out of Iran, in an attempt to understand what is really making things work in its domestic and international affairs. Recent reports have analyzed President [[Ahmadinejad]]'s unique economic policies; [[Iranian involvement in Iraq]]; the effects of [[International sanctions|sanctions]] and the trajectory of the [[Nuclear technology|nuclear]] file; the Iranian risk premium; Iran's winter gas crisis; and Iran's inability to sell the [[heavy sour crude]] from its [[Nowruz]] and [[Soroush]] fields.
* '''Saudi Arabia:''' With extensive experience and contacts in [[Saudi Arabia]], [http://www.foreignreports.com/ Foreign Reports] is able to report with confidence on the country with the largest [[oil reserves]], highest level of [[oil production]], and the highest [[spare production capacity]]. Political and economic decisions made by the [[Monarchy|Kingdom]] are critical to world oil markets, and [http://www.foreignreports.com/ Foreign Reports] closely follows these developments. Recent reports have analyzed Saudi oil policies; the Saudi viewpoint on oil prices; the development of the 500,000 b/d project soon to be brought online from the Kingdom's [[Khursaniyah]] field; and the 1.2 million b/d project at the [[Khurais]] field expected to be brought online in June 2009.

'''Grid balancing''' has become an important aspect for the power grid in matching the supply of energy to demand.  In more recent years this has become less predictable with more [[renewable energy]] being installed into the grid.

This has resulted in [[wind farms]] being turned off at night time, when it is windy, but there is no demand. In Scotland this has resulted in payouts,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/home-news/grid-pays-6m-to-turn-off-wind-farm-turbines.21096009 |title=Grid pays £6m to turn off wind farm turbines |publisher=Herald Scotland |date=2013-05-15 |accessdate=2013-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; most recently over £6m in 33 days has been paid by the grid to wind farms to not generate electricity.

Constraint payments are made to other electricity suppliers as well as wind. In 2011/2012, payments  by the National Grid in the UK totaled £324 million of which £31 million went to wind. In 2012/2013, thanks to improved transmission capability, they were £130 million of which only £7 million were for wind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalgrid.com/uk/Electricity/AboutElectricity/Balancing+the+network/ |title=How we balance the country’s electricity transmission system |publisher=National Grid |date= |accessdate=2013-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This temporarily excess [[electric energy]] could alternatively be used in [[electrolysis of water]] to make high purity [[hydrogen fuel]] used in [[fuel cell]]s. In areas with little hydroelectricity, [[pumped storage]] systems such as the [[Dinorwig Power Station]] can allow the energy to be used for [[Operating reserve|operational reserve]] or at times of peak demand rather than run a natural gas [[peaking power plant]].

[[File:Hotspot(geology)-1.svg|thumb|170px|Diagram showing a cross section through the Earth's [[lithosphere]] (in yellow) with [[magma]] rising from the [[Mantle (geology)|mantle]] (in red)]]
In [[geology]], the places known as '''hotspots''' or '''hot spots''' are [[volcanic]] regions thought to be fed by underlying [[Mantle (geology)|mantle]] that is anomalously hot compared with the surrounding mantle.{{fact|date=August 2018}} Their position on the Earth's surface is independent of [[plate boundary|tectonic plate boundaries]]. There are two hypotheses that attempt to explain their origins. One suggests that hotspots are due to [[mantle plume]]s that rise as thermal [[diapir]]s from the core–mantle boundary.&lt;ref name="Morgan"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Convection Plumes in the Lower Mantle|author=W. J. Morgan|url=http://www.mantleplumes.org/Morgan1971.html|journal=Nature |volume=230 | pages=42–43 |date=5 March 1971 | doi=10.1038/230042a0 |bibcode=1971Natur.230...42M |issue=5288}}&lt;/ref&gt; The other hypothesis is that lithospheric extension permits the passive rising of melt from shallow depths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.mantleplumes.org/ | title=Do plumes exist? | accessdate=2010-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Foulger"&gt;{{cite book |title=Plates vs. Plumes: A Geological Controversy |author=Foulger, G.R. |url=http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-1405161485.html |date=2010 |isbn=978-1-4051-6148-0 |publisher=[[Wiley-Blackwell]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; This hypothesis considers the term "hotspot" to be a misnomer, asserting that the mantle source beneath them is, in fact, not anomalously hot at all.  Well-known examples include the [[Hawaii hotspot|Hawaii]], [[Iceland hotspot|Iceland]] and [[Yellowstone hotspot]]s.

==Origin==
[[Image:Partial melting asthenosphere EN.svg|thumb|right|Schematic diagram showing the physical processes inside the Earth that lead to the generation of magma. Partial melting begins above the fusion point.]]
The origins of the concept of hotspots lie in the work of [[J. Tuzo Wilson]], who postulated in 1963 that the formation of the [[Hawaiian Islands]] resulted from the slow movement of a [[tectonic plate]] across a hot region beneath the surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=A possible origin of the Hawaiian Islands |first=J. Tuzo |last=Wilson |journal=Canadian Journal of Physics |date=1963 |url=http://www.mantleplumes.org/WebDocuments/Wilson1963.pdf |volume=41 |pages=863–870 |doi=10.1139/p63-094|issue=6 |bibcode=1963CaJPh..41..863W}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was later postulated that hotspots are fed by narrow streams of [[heat|hot]] [[Mantle (geology)|mantle]] rising from the Earth's [[core–mantle boundary]] in a structure called a [[mantle plume]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Hotspots: Mantle thermal plumes | publisher = [[United States Geological Survey]] | date = 1999-05-05 | url = http://pubs.usgs.gov/gip/dynamic/hotspots.html | accessdate = 2008-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Whether or not such mantle plumes exist is the subject of a major controversy in Earth science.&lt;ref name="Foulger" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last = Wright | first = Laura | title = Earth's interior: Raising hot spots   | work = Geotimes | publisher = [[American Geological Institute]] | date = November 2000 | url = http://www.geotimes.org/nov00/hotspot.html | accessdate = 2008-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Estimates for the number of hotspots postulated to be fed by mantle plumes have ranged from about 20 to several thousands, over the years, with most geologists considering a few tens to exist. [[Hawaii hotspot|Hawaii]], [[Réunion hotspot|Réunion]], [[Yellowstone hotspot|Yellowstone]], [[Galápagos hotspot|Galápagos]], and [[Iceland hotspot|Iceland]] are some of the most active volcanic regions to which the hypothesis is applied.

==Composition==
Most hotspot volcanoes are [[basaltic]] (e.g., [[Hawaiian hotspot|Hawaii]], [[Tahiti hotspot|Tahiti]]). As a result, they are less explosive than [[subduction zone]] volcanoes, in which water is trapped under the overriding plate. Where hotspots occur in [[continental crust|continental regions]], [[basalt]]ic [[magma]] rises through the continental crust, which melts to form [[rhyolite]]s. These [[rhyolite]]s can form violent eruptions.&lt;ref&gt;Donald Hyndman; David Hyndman (1 January 2016). Natural Hazards and Disasters. Cengage Learning. pp. 44–. {{ISBN|978-1-305-88818-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wolfgang Frisch; Martin Meschede; Ronald C. Blakey (2 November 2010). Plate Tectonics: Continental Drift and Mountain Building. Springer Science &amp; Business Media. pp. 87–. {{ISBN|978-3-540-76504-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the [[Yellowstone Caldera]] was formed by some of the most powerful volcanic explosions in geologic history. However, when the rhyolite is completely erupted, it may be followed by eruptions of basaltic magma rising through the same lithospheric fissures (cracks in the lithosphere). An example of this activity is the [[Ilgachuz Range]] in British Columbia, which was created by an early complex series of [[trachyte]] and [[rhyolite]] eruptions, and late extrusion of a sequence of basaltic lava flows.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| author = Holbek, Peter | title = Report on Preliminary Geology and Geochemistry of the Ilga Claim Group | publisher = | date = November 1983 | url = http://aris.empr.gov.bc.ca/ArisReports/12214.PDF | format = PDF | accessdate = 2008-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The hotspot hypothesis is now closely linked to the [[mantle plume]] hypothesis.&lt;ref&gt;Mainak Choudhuri; Michal Nemčok (22 August 2016). Mantle Plumes and Their Effects. Springer. pp. 18–. {{ISBN|978-3-319-44239-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Comparison with island arc volcanoes==
Hotspot volcanoes are considered to have a fundamentally different origin from [[island arc]] volcanoes. The latter form over [[subduction]] zones, at converging plate boundaries.  When one oceanic plate meets another, the denser plate is forced downward into a deep ocean trench. This plate, as it is subducted, releases water into the base of the over-riding plate, and this water mixes with the rock, thus changing its composition causing some rock to melt and rise. It is this that fuels a chain of volcanoes, such as the [[Aleutian Islands]], near [[Alaska]].

[[Image:Hualālai 1996.jpg|thumb|[[Hualalai]] is a massive shield volcano in the [[Hawaiian–Emperor seamount chain]]. Its last eruption was in 1801.]]

The joint [[mantle plume]]/hotspot hypothesis envisages the feeder structures to be fixed relative to one another, with the continents and [[seafloor]] drifting overhead. The hypothesis thus predicts that time-progressive chains of volcanoes are developed on the surface. Examples are [[Yellowstone]], which lies at the end of a chain of extinct calderas, which become progressively older to the west. Another example is the Hawaiian archipelago, where islands become progressively older and more deeply eroded to the northwest.

Geologists have tried to use hotspot volcanic chains to track the movement of the Earth's tectonic plates. This effort has been vexed by the lack of very long chains, by the fact that many are not time-progressive (e.g. the [[Galápagos Islands|Galápagos]]) and by the fact that hotspots do not appear to be fixed relative to one another (e.g. [[Hawaii]] and [[Iceland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.mantleplumes.org/HawaiiBend.html | title=What the hell is Hawaii? | accessdate=2011-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;)

The '''Knickerbocker storm''' was a [[blizzard]] that occurred on January 27&amp;ndash;28, 1922 in the upper South and middle Atlantic [[United States]].  The storm took its name from the resulting collapse of the [[Knickerbocker Theatre (Washington, D.C.)|Knickerbocker Theatre]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] shortly after 9 p.m. on January 28 which killed 98&amp;nbsp;people and injured 133.&lt;ref name="KEV"&gt;{{cite web |author=Ambrose, Kevin |work=Washington Weather Book |url=http://www.weatherbook.com/knickerbocker.htm |title=The Knickerbocker Snowstorm of January 27–28, 1922 |accessdate=2006-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Setup for the event==
An Arctic airmass was in place across the northeast [[United States]]; Washington, D.C. had been below freezing since the afternoon of January 23.&lt;ref name="STER"&gt;{{cite web |publisher=National Weather Service Office Sterling, Virginia |url=http://www.erh.noaa.gov/er/lwx/Historic_Events/StormsOfCentury.html |title=The Greatest Storms of the Century in the Greater Washington-Baltimore Region |accessdate=2006-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The front that spawned the cyclone was almost completely dry until after it crossed the Gulf of Mexico, making this storm unique among large southeast snowstorms.  Despite the slow start, a low formed and deepened rapidly off the Georgia coast as the cold front reached the Gulf Stream on January 27. Heavy snow quickly developed from the Carolinas to Pennsylvania as the low drifted north to the outer Banks of North Carolina on the 28th. A strong high pressure to the north helped to cut the system off from the jet stream. As a result, the [[cyclone]] took three days to move up the [[East Coast of the United States|Eastern Seaboard]], which was double the normal time used by forecasters of that era to move storm systems up the coast.  Snow reached [[Philadelphia]] and Washington, D.C. by noon on January 28, and continued into the morning of January 29.  Temperatures remained in the 20s [[Fahrenheit]] (-5 [[Celsius|°C]]) through much of the event.&lt;ref name="QUO"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.geocities.com/donsutherland1/quotes6.html |title=Quotes:  Page 6 |accessdate=2006-10-24|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090807224556/http://geocities.com/donsutherland1/quotes6.html|archivedate=2009-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impact==
[[File:Knickerbocker Snowstorm 1922.jpg|thumb|Deep snow drifts near the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C.]]
An estimated 22,400 square miles (58,000&amp;nbsp;km²) of the northeast [[United States]] were affected by 20&amp;nbsp;inches (51&amp;nbsp;cm) of [[snow]] from this [[cyclone]], which was over one-fifth of the total area that received over 4 in (10&amp;nbsp;cm) of snow. Snowfall was quite heavy in [[Maryland]] and [[Virginia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=New Hampshire Homeland Security and Emergency Management Operations |url=http://www.nhoem.state.nh.us/mitigation/fig%204-8.htm |title=History of Significant Snowstorms in the Northeast U.S. |accessdate=2006-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Richmond, Virginia]] recorded {{convert|19|in|cm}}. [[Baltimore, Maryland]] was paralyzed as it received the most snowfall within 24&amp;nbsp;hours since 1872.{{Citation needed|date = January 2016}} Parts of North Carolina also received over one foot of snow.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Northeast Snowstorms|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=eeM_AAAAQBAJ|publisher = Springer Science &amp; Business Media|date = 2013-03-28|isbn = 9781878220325|language = en|first = Paul|last = Kocin|first2 = Louis|last2 = Uccellini|volume = 1|pages = 325–328}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Impact in Washington, D.C. ===
The measured snow depth at the main observing site in Washington, D.C. reached 28 in (71&amp;nbsp;cm) while an observer in [[Rock Creek Park]] a few miles to the north measured 33 in (84&amp;nbsp;cm) with 3.02 in (76.7&amp;nbsp;mm) of liquid equivalent.&lt;ref name="KEV" /&gt; Railroad lines between [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]] and Washington, D.C. were covered by at least 36 in (91&amp;nbsp;cm) of snow, with drifts as high as 16&amp;nbsp;ft (4.9 m).&lt;ref name="QUO" /&gt; This snowstorm is the biggest in the history of [[Washington, D.C.]] since official record keeping began in 1885 (although it is dwarfed by the {{convert|36|in|cm}} of snow in the [[Washington–Jefferson Storm]] of January 1772).&lt;ref name=DOC&gt;{{cite web |publisher=The Weather Doctor |url=http://www.islandnet.com/~see/weather/events/wjsnow1772.htm |title=The Washington and Jefferson Snowstorm of 1772 |author=Keith C. Heidorn |date=January 1, 2012 |accessdate=January 25, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Among other disruptions, Congress adjourned as a result of the storm.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Theater roof collapse==
[[File:KnickerbockerInterior.jpg|thumb|Interior of the Knickerbocker Theater after the collapse of the roof as a result of the weight of snow from the storm.]]
The [[Knickerbocker Theatre (Washington, D.C.)|Knickerbocker Theatre]] was the largest and newest movie house in Washington, D.C., built in 1917 and owned by [[Harry Crandall|Harry M. Crandall]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=A Movie-Going Capital |author=Gomery, Douglas |journal=Washington History |publisher=The Historical Society of Washington, D.C. |date=Spring–Summer 1997 |volume=9 |issue=1 |pages=4–23}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The roof was flat, which allowed the snow which had recently fallen to remain on the roof.  During the movie's (''[[Get-Rich-Quick Wallingford (1921 film)|Get-Rich-Quick Wallingford]]'') intermission, the weight of the heavy, wet snow became too much for the roof to bear.  The roof split down the middle, bringing down the balcony seating as well as a portion of the brick wall. Dozens were buried. The disaster ranks as one of the worst in [[History of Washington, D.C.|Washington, D.C. history]].&lt;ref name="KEV"/&gt; Congressman [[Andrew Jackson Barchfeld]] was among those killed in the theater. The theater's architect, [[Reginald Geare|Reginald Wyckliffe Geare]], and owner, [[Harry Crandall|Harry M. Crandall]], later committed suicide; Geare in 1927 and Crandall in 1937.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Fishbein, Gershon |title=A Winter's Tale of Tragedy |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/01/21/AR2009012101298.html |accessdate=2009-01-24 | work=The Washington Post | date=January 22, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Laser ablation''' or '''photoablation''' is the process of removing material from a solid (or occasionally liquid) surface by irradiating it with a [[laser]] beam.  At low laser flux, the material is heated by the absorbed laser energy and [[evaporation|evaporates]] or [[Sublimation (chemistry)|sublimates]].  At high laser flux, the material is typically converted to a [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]].  Usually, laser [[ablation]] refers to removing material with a [[pulsed laser]], but it is possible to ablate material with a [[continuous wave laser]] beam if the laser intensity is high enough. [[Excimer laser]]s of deep ultra-violet light are mainly used in photoablation; the wavelength of laser used in photoablation is approximately 200&amp;nbsp;nm.

==Fundamentals==
The depth over which the laser energy is absorbed, and thus the amount of material removed by a single laser pulse, depends on the material's optical properties and the laser [[wavelength]] and pulse length. The total mass ablated from the target per laser pulse is usually referred to as ablation rate. Such features of laser radiation as laser beam scanning velocity and the covering of scanning lines can significantly influence the ablation process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://ntv.ifmo.ru/en/article/13480/lazernaya_ablyaciya_monokristallicheskogo_kremniyapod_deystviem_impulsno-chastotnogo_izlucheniyavolokonnogo_lazera.htm|title= Laser ablation of monocrystalline silicon under pulsed-frequency fiber laser|author1=Veiko V.P. |author2=Skvortsov A.M. |author3=Huynh Cong Tu |author4=Petrov A.A. |journal=Scientific and Technical Journal of Information Technologies, Mechanics and Optics|volume=15|issue=3|page=426|year=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Laser pulses can vary over a very wide range of duration ([[millisecond]]s to [[femtosecond]]s) and fluxes, and can be precisely controlled. This makes laser ablation very valuable for both research and industrial applications.

==Applications==
The simplest application of laser ablation is to remove material from a solid surface in a controlled fashion.  [[Laser machining]] and particularly [[laser drilling]] are examples; pulsed lasers can drill extremely small, deep holes through very hard materials.  Very short laser pulses remove material so quickly that the surrounding material absorbs very little heat, so laser drilling can be done on delicate or heat-sensitive materials, including [[tooth enamel]] ([[Dental laser|laser dentistry]]). Several workers have employed laser ablation and gas condensation to produce nano particles of metal, metal oxides and metal carbides.

Also, laser energy can be selectively absorbed by coatings, particularly on metal, so [[Carbon dioxide laser|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] or [[Nd:YAG]] pulsed lasers can be used to clean surfaces, remove paint or coating, or prepare surfaces for painting without damaging the underlying surface. High power lasers clean a large spot with a single pulse. Lower power lasers use many small pulses which may be scanned across an area.

One of the advantages is that no solvents are used, therefore it is environmentally friendly and operators are not exposed to chemicals (assuming nothing harmful is vaporized).{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} It is relatively easy to automate. The running costs are lower than dry media or [[dry-ice blasting]], although the capital investment costs are much higher. The process is gentler than abrasive techniques, e.g. carbon fibres within a composite material are not damaged. Heating of the target is minimal.

Another class of applications uses laser ablation to process the material removed into new forms either not possible or difficult to produce by other means.  A recent example is the production of [[carbon nanotubes]].

Laser ablation is also used in removing rust from iron objects easily.

In March 1995 Guo et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1021/j100027a002 |date=1995 |vauthors=Guo T, Nikolaev P, Rinzler D, Tomanek DT, Colbert DT, Smalley RE |journal=[[J. Phys. Chem.]] |volume=99 |pages=10694–7 |title=Self-Assembly of Tubular Fullerenes |issue=27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; were the first to report the use of a [[laser]] to [[ablate]] a block of pure [[graphite]], and later graphite mixed with [[catalytic]] [[metal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/0009-2614(95)00825-O |title=Catalytic growth of single-walled nanotubes by laser vaporization |date=1995 |vauthors=Guo T, Nikolaev P, Thess A, Colbert DT, Smalley RE |journal=[[Chem. Phys. Lett.]] |volume=243 |pages=49–54|bibcode = 1995CPL...243...49B }}&lt;/ref&gt; The catalytic metal can consist of elements such as [[cobalt]], [[niobium]], [[platinum]], [[nickel]], [[copper]], or a binary combination thereof. The composite block is formed by making a paste of graphite powder, carbon cement, and the metal. The paste is next placed in a cylindrical mold and baked for several hours. After solidification, the graphite block is placed inside an oven with a laser pointed at it, and [[argon]] gas is pumped along the direction of the laser point. The oven temperature is approximately 1200&amp;nbsp;°C. As the laser ablates the target, [[carbon nanotubes]] form and are carried by the gas flow onto a cool copper collector. Like carbon nanotubes formed using the [[Electric arc|electric-arc discharge]] technique, carbon nanotube fibers are deposited in a haphazard and tangled fashion. Single-walled nanotubes are formed from the block of graphite and metal catalyst particles, whereas multi-walled nanotubes form from the pure graphite starting material.

A variation of this type of application is to use laser ablation to create coatings by ablating the coating material from a source and letting it deposit on the surface to be coated; this is a special type of [[physical vapor deposition]] called [[pulsed laser deposition]] (PLD),&lt;ref&gt;Robert Eason - ''Pulsed Laser Deposition of Thin Films: Applications-Led Growth of Functional Materials''. [[Wiley-Interscience]], 2006, {{ISBN|0471447099}}&lt;/ref&gt; and can create coatings from materials that cannot readily be evaporated any other way.  This process is used to manufacture some types of [[high temperature superconductor]] and laser crystals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Grant-Jacob|first=James A.|last2=Beecher|first2=Stephen J.|last3=Parsonage|first3=Tina L.|last4=Hua|first4=Ping|last5=Mackenzie|first5=Jacob I.|last6=Shepherd|first6=David P.|last7=Eason|first7=Robert W.|date=2016-01-01|title=An 11.5 W Yb:YAG planar waveguide laser fabricated via pulsed laser deposition|journal=Optical Materials Express|language=EN|volume=6|issue=1|doi=10.1364/ome.6.000091|issn=2159-3930|pages=91|bibcode=2016OMExp...6...91G}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Remote laser [[spectroscopy]] uses laser ablation to create a plasma from the surface material; the composition of the surface can be determined by analyzing the wavelengths of light emitted by the plasma.

Laser ablation is also used to create pattern, removing selectively coating from [[dichroic]] filter. This products are used in stage lighting for high dimensional projections, or for calibration of machine vision's instruments.

===Propulsion===
Finally, laser ablation can be used to transfer momentum to a surface, since the ablated material applies a pulse of high pressure to the surface underneath it as it expands.  The effect is similar to hitting the surface with a hammer.  This process is used in industry to work-harden metal surfaces, and is one damage mechanism for a [[laser weapon]].  It is also the basis of pulsed [[laser propulsion]] for spacecraft.

===Manufacturing===
The laser ablation of electronic semiconductors and microprocessors is now being pioneered in the UK to keep electronic manufacturers' designs confidential. The main reason is that it greatly reduces the risk of copying infringements.

Processes are currently being developed to use laser ablation in the removal of thermal barrier coating on high-pressure gas turbine components. Due to the low heat input, TBC removal can be completed with minimal damage to the underlying metallic coatings and parent material.

==Chemical analysis==
Laser ablation is used as a sampling method for [[inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry]] with forensic&lt;ref name="OrellanaGálvez2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Orellana|first1=Francisco Alamilla|last2=Gálvez|first2=César González|last3=Orellana|first3=Francisco Alamilla|last4=Gálvez|first4=César González|last5=Roldán|first5=Mercedes Torre|last6=García-Ruiz|first6=Carmen|last7=Roldán|first7=Mercedes Torre|last8=García-Ruiz|first8=Carmen|title=Applications of laser-ablation-inductively-coupled plasma-mass spectrometry in chemical analysis of forensic evidence|journal=TrAC Trends in Analytical Chemistry|volume=42|year=2013|pages=1–34|issn=0165-9936|doi=10.1016/j.trac.2012.09.015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and biological&lt;ref name="UrgastBeattie2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Urgast|first1=Dagmar S.|last2=Beattie|first2=John H.|last3=Feldmann|first3=Jörg|title=Imaging of trace elements in tissues|journal=Current Opinion in Clinical Nutrition and Metabolic Care|volume=17|issue=5|year=2014|pages=431–439|issn=1363-1950|doi=10.1097/MCO.0000000000000087|pmid=25023186}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PozebonScheffler2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pozebon|first1=Dirce|last2=Scheffler|first2=Guilherme L.|last3=Dressler|first3=Valderi L.|last4=Nunes|first4=Matheus A.

Spectrom.|volume=29|issue=12|year=2014|pages=2204–2228|issn=0267-9477|doi=10.1039/C4JA00250D}}&lt;/ref&gt; applications.

===Biology===
Laser ablation is used in science to destroy nerves and other tissues to study their function. For example, a species of [[pond snail]], ''[[Helisoma trivolvis]]'', can have their [[sensory neurons]] laser ablated off when the snail is still an embryo to prevent use of those nerves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kuang S, Doran SA, Wilson RJ, Goss GG, Goldberg JI |title=Serotonergic sensory-motor neurons mediate a behavioral response to hypoxia in pond snail embryos |journal=[[J. Neurobiol.]] |volume=52 |issue=1 |pages=73–83 |date=2002 |pmid=12115895 |doi=10.1002/neu.10071 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another example is the [[trochophore]] larva of ''[[Platynereis dumerilii]]'', where the larval eye was ablated and the larvae was not phototactic, anymore.&lt;ref name=Jekely2008&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jékely|first1=Gáspár|last2=Colombelli|first2=Julien|last3=Hausen|first3=Harald|last4=Guy|first4=Keren|last5=Stelzer|first5=Ernst|last6=Nédélec|first6=François|last7=Arendt|first7=Detlev|title=Mechanism of phototaxis in marine zooplankton|journal=Nature|date=20 November 2008|volume=456|issue=7220|pages=395–399|doi=10.1038/nature07590|pmid=19020621|bibcode = 2008Natur.456..395J }}&lt;/ref&gt; However phototaxis in the  [[nectochaete]] larva of ''Platynereis dumerilii'' is not mediated by the larval eyes, because the larva is still phototactic, even if the larval eyes are ablated. But if the adult eyes are ablated, then the nectochaete is not phototactic anymore and thus phototaxis in the nectochaete larva is mediated by the adult eyes.&lt;ref name=Rande2014&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Randel|first1=Nadine|last2=Asadulina|first2=Albina|last3=Bezares-Calderón|first3=Luis A|last4=Verasztó|first4=Csaba|last5=Williams|first5=Elizabeth A|last6=Conzelmann|first6=Markus|last7=Shahidi|first7=Réza|last8=Jékely|first8=Gáspár|title=Neuronal connectome of a sensory-motor circuit for visual navigation|journal=eLife|date=27 May 2014|volume=3|doi=10.7554/eLife.02730|pmid=24867217|pmc=4059887}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Laser ablation can also be used to destroy individual cells during [[embryogenesis]] of an organism, like ''Platynereis dumerilii'', to study the effect of missing cells during development.

Huebsch  |page=95}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Graebel"&gt;{{cite book|last=Graebel|first=W.P.|title=Engineering Fluid Mechanics|year=2001|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-1-56032-733-2 |page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{M} = \frac{u}{c},&lt;/math&gt;

where:
: {{serif|M}} is the Mach number,
: {{mvar|u}} is the local flow velocity with respect to the boundaries (either internal, such as an object immersed in the flow, or external, like a channel), and
: {{mvar|c}} is the speed of sound in the medium.

By definition, at Mach{{nbsp}}1, the local flow velocity {{mvar|u}} is equal to the speed of sound. At Mach{{nbsp}}0.65, {{mvar|u}} is 65% of the speed of sound (subsonic), and, at Mach{{nbsp}}1.35, {{mvar|u}} is 35% faster than the speed of sound (supersonic).

The local speed of sound, and thereby the Mach number, depends on the condition of the surrounding medium, in particular the temperature. The Mach number is primarily used to determine the approximation with which a flow can be treated as an [[incompressible flow]]. The medium can be a gas or a liquid. The boundary can be traveling in the medium, or it can be stationary while the medium flows along it, or they can both be moving, with different [[velocity|velocities]]: what matters is their relative velocity with respect to each other. The boundary can be the boundary of an object immersed in the medium, or of a channel such as a [[nozzle]], [[jet engine#Air intake|diffusers]] or [[wind tunnel]]s channeling the medium. As the Mach number is defined as the ratio of two speeds, it is a [[dimensionless number]]. If {{serif|M}}&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;0.2–0.3 and the flow is [[steady flow|quasi-steady]] and [[isothermal flow|isothermal]], compressibility effects will be small and simplified incompressible flow equations can be used.&lt;ref name="Young_et_al" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Graebel" /&gt;

The Mach number is named after [[Austria]]n physicist and philosopher [[Ernst Mach]], and is a designation proposed by aeronautical engineer [[Jakob Ackeret]]. As the Mach number is a dimensionless quantity rather than a unit of measure, with Mach, the number comes ''after'' the unit; the second Mach number is ''Mach{{nbsp}}2'' instead of ''2{{nbsp}}Mach'' (or Machs). This is somewhat reminiscent of the early modern ocean sounding unit ''mark'' (a synonym for [[fathom]]), which was also unit-first, and may have influenced the use of the term Mach. In the decade preceding [[sound barrier#Attempts to break the sound barrier|faster-than-sound human flight]], aeronautical engineers referred to the speed of sound as ''Mach's number'', never ''Mach 1''.&lt;ref&gt;Bodie, Warren M., ''The Lockheed P-38 Lightning'', Widewing Publications {{ISBN|0-9629359-0-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
[[File:Comparison US standard atmosphere 1962.svg|thumb|The speed of sound (blue) depends only on the temperature variation at altitude (red) and can be calculated from it since isolated density and pressure effects on the speed of sound cancel each other. The speed of sound increases with height in two regions of the stratosphere and thermosphere, due to heating effects in these regions.]]
Mach number is useful because the fluid behaves in a similar manner at a given Mach number, regardless of other variables.&lt;ref name=NASA&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/k-12/airplane/mach.html |work=[[NASA]] |title=Mach Number |editor=Nancy Hall}}&lt;/ref&gt; As modeled in the [[International Standard Atmosphere]], dry air at [[mean sea level]], standard temperature of {{convert|15|C|F}}, the speed of sound is {{convert|340.3|m/s|ft/s|sp=us|sigfig=5}}.&lt;ref&gt;Clancy, L.J. (1975), Aerodynamics, Table 1, Pitman Publishing London, {{ISBN|0-273-01120-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The speed of sound is not a constant; in a gas, it increases as the [[absolute temperature]] increases, and since atmospheric temperature generally decreases with increasing altitude between sea level and {{convert|11000|m|ft|sp=us|sigfig=5}}, the speed of sound also decreases. For example, the standard atmosphere model lapses temperature to {{convert|-56.5|C|F}} at {{convert|11000|m|ft|sp=us|sigfig=5}} altitude, with a corresponding speed of sound (Mach{{nbsp}}1) of {{convert|295.0|m/s|ft/s|sp=us|sigfig=4}}, 86.7% of the sea level value.

== Classification of Mach regimes ==
&lt;!-- This seems to be a copy of: http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hypersonic_speed&amp;oldid=511832073; inserted here in this diff: http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mach_number&amp;oldid=517664045 --&gt;
While the terms ''subsonic'' and ''supersonic'', in the purest sense, refer to speeds below and above the local speed of sound respectively, aerodynamicists often use the same terms to talk about particular ranges of Mach values. This occurs because of the presence of a ''transonic regime'' around M = 1 where approximations of the [[Navier-Stokes equations]] used for subsonic design no longer apply; the simplest explanation is that the flow locally begins to exceed M = 1 even though the freestream Mach number is below this value.

Meanwhile, the ''supersonic regime'' is usually used to talk about the set of Mach numbers for which linearised theory may be used, where for example the ([[air]]) flow is not chemically reacting, and where heat-transfer between air and vehicle may be reasonably neglected in calculations.

In the following table, the ''regimes'' or ''ranges of Mach values'' are referred to, and not the ''pure'' meanings of the words ''subsonic'' and ''supersonic''.

Generally, [[NASA]] defines ''high'' hypersonic as any Mach number from 10 to 25, and re-entry speeds as anything greater than Mach 25. Aircraft operating in this regime include the [[Space Shuttle]] and various space planes in development.

| Most often propeller-driven and commercial [[turbofan]] aircraft with high aspect-ratio (slender) wings, and rounded features like the nose and leading edges.
The subsonic speed range is that range of speeds within all of the airflow over an aircraft is less than Mach 1.  The critical Mach number (Mcrit) is lowest free stream mach number at which airflow over any part of the aircraft first reaches Mach 1.  So the subsonic speed range includes all speeds that are less than Mcrit.

| Transonic aircraft nearly always have [[swept wing]]s, causing the delay of drag-divergence, and often feature a design that adheres to the principles of the Whitcomb [[Area rule]].
The transonic speed range is that range of speeds within which the airflow over different parts of an aircraft is between subsonic and supersonic. So the regime of flight from Mcrit up to Mach 1.3 is called the transonic range.

| The supersonic speed range is that range of speeds within which all of the airflow over an aircraft is supersonic (more than Mach 1).  But airflow meeting the leading edges is initially decelerated, so the free stream speed must be slightly greater than Mach 1 to ensure that all of the flow over the aircraft is supersonic.  It is commonly accepted that the supersonic speed range starts at a free stream speed greater than Mach 1.3.
Aircraft designed to fly at supersonic speeds show large differences in their aerodynamic design because of the radical differences in the behaviour of flows above Mach 1. Sharp edges, thin [[aerofoil]]-sections, and all-moving [[tailplane]]/[[canard (aeronautics)|canards]] are common. Modern [[combat aircraft]] must compromise in order to maintain low-speed handling; "true" supersonic designs include the [[F-104 Starfighter]], [[SR-71 Blackbird]] and BAC/Aérospatiale [[Concorde]].

== High-speed flow around objects ==
Flight can be roughly classified in six categories:

For comparison: the required speed for [[low Earth orbit]] is approximately 7.5&amp;nbsp;km/s = Mach 25.4 in air at high altitudes.

At transonic speeds, the flow field around the object includes both sub- and supersonic parts. The transonic period begins when first zones of M &gt; 1 flow appear around the object. In case of an airfoil (such as an aircraft's wing), this typically happens above the wing. Supersonic flow can decelerate back to subsonic only in a normal shock; this typically happens before the trailing edge. (Fig.1a)

As the speed increases, the zone of M &gt; 1 flow increases towards both leading and trailing edges. As M = 1 is reached and passed, the normal shock reaches the trailing edge and becomes a weak oblique shock: the flow decelerates over the shock, but remains supersonic. A normal shock is created ahead of the object, and the only subsonic zone in the flow field is a small area around the object's leading edge. (Fig.1b)

'''Fig. 1.''' ''Mach number in transonic airflow around an airfoil; M &lt; 1 (a) and M &gt; 1 (b).''

When an aircraft exceeds Mach 1 (i.e. the [[sound barrier]]), a large pressure difference is created just in front of the [[aircraft]]. This abrupt pressure difference, called a [[shock wave]], spreads backward and outward from the aircraft in a cone shape (a so-called Mach cone). It is this shock wave that causes the [[sonic boom]] heard as a fast moving aircraft travels overhead. A person inside the aircraft will not hear this. The higher the speed, the more narrow the cone; at just over M = 1 it is hardly a cone at all, but closer to a slightly concave plane.

At fully supersonic speed, the shock wave starts to take its cone shape and flow is either completely supersonic, or (in case of a blunt object), only a very small subsonic flow area remains between the object's nose and the shock wave it creates ahead of itself. (In the case of a sharp object, there is no air between the nose and the shock wave: the shock wave starts from the nose.)

As the Mach number increases, so does the strength of the [[shock wave]] and the Mach cone becomes increasingly narrow. As the fluid flow crosses the shock wave, its speed is reduced and temperature, pressure, and density increase. The stronger the shock, the greater the changes. At high enough Mach numbers the temperature increases so much over the shock that ionization and dissociation of gas molecules behind the shock wave begin. Such flows are called hypersonic.

It is clear that any object traveling at hypersonic speeds will likewise be exposed to the same extreme temperatures as the gas behind the nose shock wave, and hence choice of heat-resistant materials becomes important.

== High-speed flow in a channel ==
As a flow in a channel becomes supersonic, one significant change takes place. The conservation of [[mass flow rate]] leads one to expect that contracting the flow channel would increase the flow speed (i.e. making the channel narrower results in faster air flow) and at subsonic speeds this holds true. However, once the flow becomes supersonic, the relationship of flow area and speed is reversed: expanding the channel actually increases the speed.

The obvious result is that in order to accelerate a flow to supersonic, one needs a convergent-divergent nozzle, where the converging section accelerates the flow to sonic speeds, and the diverging section continues the acceleration. Such nozzles are called [[de Laval nozzle]]s and in extreme cases they are able to reach [[hypersonic]] speeds ({{convert|13|Mach}} at 20&amp;nbsp;°C).

An aircraft [[Machmeter]] or electronic flight information system ([[EFIS]]) can display Mach number derived from stagnation pressure ([[pitot tube]]) and static pressure.

==Calculation==

The Mach number at which an aircraft is flying can be calculated by
:&lt;math&gt;
\mathrm{M} = \frac{u}{c}
&lt;/math&gt;

where:
: M is the Mach number
: ''u'' is [[velocity]] of the moving aircraft and
: ''c'' is the [[speed of sound]] at the given altitude

Note that the dynamic pressure can be found as:
:&lt;math&gt;q = \frac{\gamma}{2} p\, \mathrm{M}^2&lt;/math&gt;

Assuming air to be an [[ideal gas]], the formula to compute Mach number in a subsonic compressible flow is derived from [[Bernoulli's principle|Bernoulli's equation]] for M &lt; 1:&lt;ref name="Olson"&gt;Olson, Wayne M. (2002). "AFFTC-TIH-99-02, ''Aircraft Performance Flight Testing''." ([http://www.aviation.org.uk/pdf/Aircraft_Performance_Flight_Testing.pdf PDF]). Air Force Flight Test Center, Edwards AFB, CA, United States Air Force. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110904190008/http://www.aviation.org.uk/pdf/Aircraft_Performance_Flight_Testing.pdf |date=September 4, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{M} = \sqrt{\frac{2}{\gamma- 1 }\left[\left(\frac{q_c}{p} + 1\right)^\frac{\gamma - 1}{\gamma} - 1\right]}\,&lt;/math&gt;

where:
: ''q&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;'' is [[impact pressure]] (dynamic pressure) and
: ''p'' is [[static pressure]]
: &lt;math&gt;\gamma\,&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Heat capacity ratio|ratio of specific heat]] of a gas at a constant pressure to heat at a constant volume (1.4 for air).

The formula to compute Mach number in a supersonic compressible flow is derived from the [[Rayleigh number|Rayleigh]] supersonic pitot equation:
: &lt;math&gt;\frac{p_t}{p} =
  \left[\frac{\gamma + 1}{2}\mathrm{M}^2\right]^\frac{\gamma}{\gamma-1} \cdot
  \left[\frac{\gamma + 1}{1 - \gamma + 2\gamma\, \mathrm{M}^2}\right]^\frac{1}{\gamma - 1}
&lt;/math&gt;

===Calculating Mach number from pitot tube pressure===
Mach number is a function of temperature and true airspeed.
Aircraft [[flight instruments]], however, operate using pressure differential to compute Mach number, not temperature.

Assuming air to be an [[ideal gas]], the formula to compute Mach number in a subsonic compressible flow is found from Bernoulli's equation for {{nowrap|M &lt; 1}} (above):&lt;ref name="Olson" /&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{M} = \sqrt{5\left[\left(\frac{q_c}{p} + 1\right)^\frac{2}{7} - 1\right]}\,&lt;/math&gt;

The formula to compute Mach number in a supersonic compressible flow can be found from the Rayleigh supersonic pitot equation (above) using parameters for air:
: &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{M} \approx 0.88128485 \sqrt{\left(\frac{q_c}{p} + 1\right)\left(1 - \frac{1}{7\,\mathrm{M}^2}\right)^{2.5}}&lt;/math&gt;

where:
:''q&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the dynamic pressure measured behind a normal shock.

As can be seen, M appears on both sides of the equation, and for practical purposes a [[root-finding algorithm]] must be used for a numerical solution. It is first determined whether M is indeed greater than 1.0 by calculating M from the subsonic equation. If M is greater than 1.0 at that point, then the value of M from the subsonic equation is used as the initial condition for [[fixed point iteration]] of the supersonic equation, which usually converges in just a few iterations.&lt;ref name=Olson/&gt; Alternatively, [[Newton's method]] can also be used.

== Chemistry ==

Mead acid, also referred to as eicosatrienoic acid, is chemically a [[carboxylic acid]] with a 20-carbon chain and three [[methylene bridge|methylene]]-interrupted ''[[Cis-trans isomerism|cis]]'' double bonds.  The first double bond is located at the ninth carbon from the omega end. In physiological literature, it is given the name 20:3 (n-9).   (See [[Fatty Acid#Nomenclature]] for an explanation of the naming system.)  In the presence of [[lipoxygenase]], [[cytochrome p450]] or [[cyclooxygenase]] Mead acid can form various [[hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid]] (HETE) and hydroperoxy (HpETE) products.&lt;ref name=cyberlipid&gt;{{cite web

== Physiology ==
Two fatty acids, [[linoleic acid]] and [[alpha-linolenic acid]], are considered [[essential fatty acid]]s (EFAs) in humans and other mammals. Both are 18 carbon fatty acids unlike mead acid, which has 20 carbons.  Linoleic is an ω-6 fatty acid whereas linolenic is ω-3 and mead is ω-9.  One study examined patients with [[Malabsorption|intestinal fat malabsorption]] and suspected EFA deficiency; they were found to have blood-levels of Mead acid 1263% higher than reference subjects.&lt;ref name=Siguel&gt;{{cite journal

Mead acid has been found to decrease [[osteoblast]]ic activity.  This may be important in treating conditions where inhibition of bone formation is desired.&lt;ref name="HamazakiSuzuki2008"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hamazaki|first1=Tomohito|last2=Suzuki|first2=Nobuo|last3=Widyowati|first3=Retno|last4=Miyahara|first4=Tatsuro|last5=Kadota|first5=Shigetoshi|last6=Ochiai|first6=Hiroshi|last7=Hamazaki|first7=Kei|title=The Depressive Effects of 5,8,11-Eicosatrienoic Acid (20:3n-9) on Osteoblasts|journal=Lipids|volume=44|issue=2|year=2008|pages=97–102|issn=0024-4201|doi=10.1007/s11745-008-3252-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;


== Role in inflammation ==

[[Cyclooxygenase]]s are enzymes known to play a large role in inflammatory processes through oxidation of unsaturated fatty acids, most notably, the formation of [[prostaglandin H2]] from [[arachidonic acid]] which is very similar in structure to mead acid.  When physiological levels of arachidonic acid are low, other unsaturated fatty acids including mead and linoleic acid are oxidized by COX.

Mead acid is also converted to [[leukotriene]]s [[Leukotriene C3|C3]] and [[Leukotriene D3|D3]].&lt;ref name="Hammarstrom 1981 JBC"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors = Hammarstrom S|title=Conversion of 5,8,11-Eicosatrienoic Acidt to Leukotrienes C3 and D3|journal = Journal of Biological Chemistry|volume=256 |issue = 3 |page = 2275 |year = 1981 |url = http://www.jbc.org/content/256/5/2275.full.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mead acid is metabolized by [[5-lipoxygenase]] to 5-hydroxyeicosatrieonic acid (5-HETrE)&lt;ref name="pmid2988021"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors = Wei YF, Evans RW, Morrison AR, Sprechert H, Jakschik BA |title = Double bond requirement for the 5-lipoxygenase pathway |journal = Prostaglandins |volume = 29 |issue = 4 |pages = 537–45 |year = 1985 |pmid = 2988021}}&lt;/ref&gt; and then by [[5-Hydroxyeicosanoid dehydrogenase]] to 5-oxoeicosatrienoic acid (5-oxo-ETrE).&lt;ref name="PowellRokach2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Powell|first1=William S.|last2=Rokach|first2=Joshua|title=The eosinophil chemoattractant 5-oxo-ETE and the OXE receptor|journal=Progress in Lipid Research|volume=52|issue=4|year=2013|pages=651–665|issn=01637827|doi=10.1016/j.plipres.2013.09.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;
5-Oxo-ETrE is as potent as its arachidonic acid-derived analog, [[5-oxo-eicosatetraenoic acid]] (5-oxo-ETE), in stimulating human blood [[eosinophils]] and [[neutrophils]];&lt;ref name="PatelCossette2008"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Patel|first1=P.|last2=Cossette|first2=C.|last3=Anumolu|first3=J.

it presumably does so by binding to the 5-oxo-ETE receptor ([[OXER1]]) and therefore may be, like 5-oxo-ETE, a mediator of human allergic and inflammatory reactions.&lt;ref name="PowellRokach2013"/&gt;

The '''Montara oil spill''' was an [[sweet crude oil|oil]] and gas leak and subsequent slick that took place in the Montara oil field in the [[Timor Sea]], off the northern coast of [[Western Australia]]. It is considered one of Australia's worst [[oil spill|oil disasters]].&lt;ref name=ABC2&gt;{{cite news |title = WA oil spill 'one of Australia's worst' |url = http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2009/08/24/2664927.htm |work = [[ABC News (Australia)|ABC News]] |date = 24 August 2009 |accessdate = 5 November 2009 |archiveurl = https://www.webcitation.org/5l3RrgF24 |archivedate = 5 November 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The slick was released following a blowout from the Montara wellhead platform on 21 August 2009, and continued leaking until 3 November 2009 (in total 74 days), when the leak was stopped by pumping [[Drilling fluid|mud]] into the well and the wellbore cemented thus "capping" the blowout.&lt;ref name=ABCcap&gt;{{cite news |title = West Atlas oil leak stopped |url = http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2009/11/03/2732288.htm |work = [[ABC News (Australia)|ABC News]] |date = 3 November 2009 |accessdate = 5 November 2009 |archiveurl = https://www.webcitation.org/5l3R9hPbY |archivedate = 5 November 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=PTTEPpr87&gt;{{cite press release |title = PTTEP Australasia Timor Sea Operations – Incident Information #87 |url = http://www.au.pttep.com/uploads/MediaRelease87_03-11-09.pdf |publisher = PTTEP Australasia |date = 3 November 2009 |accessdate = 5 November 2009 |archiveurl = https://www.webcitation.org/5l3MMzCW3 |archivedate = 5 November 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The West Atlas rig is owned by the Norwegian-Bermudan [[Seadrill]], and operated by PTTEP Australasia (PTTEPAA), a subsidiary of [[PTT Exploration and Production]] (PTTEP) which is in turn a subsidiary of [[PTT Public Company Limited|PTT]], the Thai state-owned oil and gas company was operating over on adjacent well on the Montara platform.

The Australian [[Department of Resources, Energy and Tourism]] estimated that the Montara oil leak could be as high as {{convert|2000|oilbbl|m3}}/day, five times the {{convert|400|oilbbl|m3}}/day estimated by PTTEP Australasia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title = Oil leaking 'five times faster' than thought |url = http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2009/10/22/2721552.htm |work = [[ABC News (Australia)|ABC News]] |date = 22 October 2009 |accessdate = 5 November 2009 |archiveurl = https://www.webcitation.org/5l3RU9Sv0 |archivedate = 5 November 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A spokesman for Resources Minister, Martin Ferguson, said the {{convert|2000|oilbbl|m3}} referred to the amount of oil that the well could produce when brought into peak production.&lt;ref name="oilleak"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2009-10-22/oil-leaking-five-times-faster-than-thought/1113420 |title=Oil leaking 'five times faster' than thought |accessdate=18 March 2012 |date=22 October 2009 |work=ABC News |publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation }}&lt;/ref&gt; After flying over the spill site, Australian Greens Senator [[Rachel Siewert]] claimed the spill was far greater than had originally been reported.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first = Rachel |last = Siewert |authorlink = Rachel Siewert |title = WA oil spill much worse than thought |url = http://rachel-siewert.greensmps.org.au/content/wa-oil-spill-much-worse-thought |archiveurl = https://www.webcitation.org/5l3Ub2DTY |date = 29 August 2009 |archivedate = 5 November 2009 |accessdate = 5 November 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[World Wide Fund for Nature|WWF-Australia]] also claimed that the spill was worse than originally expected.&lt;ref name=WWF&gt;{{cite news |title = Oil leak 'worse than feared' |url = http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2009/10/23/2722164.htm |work = [[ABC News (Australia)|ABC News]] |date = 23 October 2009 |accessdate = 5 November 2009 |archiveurl = https://www.webcitation.org/5l3RaQqtC |archivedate = 5 November 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=WWF1&gt;{{cite web|first = Simon |last = Mustoe |title = Biodiversity Survey of the Montara Field Oil Leak |url = http://www.wwf.org.au/publications/montaraoilspillreport.pdf |archiveurl = https://www.webcitation.org/5l3UASSlU |publisher = [[World Wide Fund for Nature|WWF-Australia]] |date = 22 October 2009 |archivedate = 5 November 2009 |accessdate = 5 November 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first four attempts to plug the oil leak by PTTEPAA failed, but the fifth attempt succeeded on 3 November 2009, when PTTEPAA pumped approximately {{convert|3400|oilbbl|m3}} of mud into a [[relief well]] to stop the leak.&lt;ref name=ABCcap/&gt;&lt;ref name=PTTEPpr87 /&gt;&lt;ref name=plug1&gt;{{cite news |title = Latest attempt fails to stop oil leak |url = http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2009/10/17/2716879.htm |work = [[ABC News (Australia)|ABC News]] |date = 17 October 2009 |accessdate = 5 November 2009 |archiveurl = https://www.webcitation.org/5l3RdcYHc |archivedate = 5 November 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 November 2009, during an attempt to stop the leak, a fire broke out on the West Atlas drilling rig.&lt;ref name=BBCfire&gt;{{cite news |title = Australia oil well catches fire |url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/8336564.stm |work = [[BBC News]] |date = 2 November 2009 |accessdate = 5 November 2009 |archiveurl = https://www.webcitation.org/5l3Uqeqsp |archivedate = 5 November 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 2 November, PTTEPAA said that the fire appeared to be burning off the oil and thereby preventing further leakage into the sea.&lt;ref name=PTTEPpr86&gt;{{cite press release |title = PTTEP Australasia Timor Sea Operations – Incident Information #86 |url = http://www.au.pttep.com/uploads/MediaRelease86_02-11-09.pdf |publisher = PTTEP Australasia |date = 2 November 2009 |accessdate = 5 November 2009 |archiveurl = https://www.webcitation.org/5l3JjXJ8C |archivedate = 5 November 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The fire was largely extinguished when the leak was stopped.&lt;ref name=ABCcap/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title = Leaking oil rig continues to burn |url = http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2009/11/01/2730073.htm |work = [[ABC News (Australia)|ABC News]] |date = 1 November 2009 |accessdate = 5 November 2009 |archiveurl = https://www.webcitation.org/5l3Rjatdw |archivedate = 5 November 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Once safety criteria were met, a specialist team boarded the Montara wellhead platform and the West Atlas to assess the damages.

The operation later in November 2009 to finally plug the well after the leak was stopped involved pumping a 1,400&amp;nbsp;metre cement plug from the West Triton rig down the relief well to the bottom of the 2.5 kilometre well. Once completed, the West Triton relief rig was demobilised and returned to Singapore.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.au.pttep.com/uploads/MediaRelease13_27-08-09.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2009, a team from PTTEPAA and Alert Well Control returned to the Montara field to complete the final stages of the operation, which involved inserting two mechanical barriers at depth above the cement plug into the well.
Operations were completed in January 2010 when the reboarding team installed a capping assembly on the well.

Work to safely remove the West Atlas drilling rig from the Montara well head platform (WHP) in the Timor Sea started in August 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lloydslistdcn.com.au/archive/2010/september/15/west-atlas-rig-removal-begins|title=Lloyd's List Australia - Home|author=Lloyd's List Australia|publisher=|accessdate=24 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The offshore construction vessel ''Jascon 25'' equipped with an 800-tonne crane was mobilised for the salvage operations.  This work was expected to take about three months and involve cleaning and removal of debris from the rig as well as the cantilever drill floor which was left extended over the WHP helideck after the fire in November 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bairdmaritime.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=7992:jascon-25-arrives-in-australia-to-remove-west-atlas&amp;catid=70&amp;Itemid=62|title=‘Jascon 25’ arrives in Australia to remove ‘West Atlas’|author=Tristan Tremschnig|publisher=|accessdate=24 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After the debris removal work was completed, this was followed by the jacking down of the West Atlas rig to be towed to Singapore.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Ker (29 September 2010).

PTTEPAA announced a major transformation of its Australian drilling operations on 24 November 2010 following the release of the Australian Government’s Montara Commission of Inquiry report into causes of the incident.
The company said it was implementing a nine-point Action Plan to embed the highest standards of oil field practice and safety in its operations.  PTTEPAA said it regretted the Montara incident and acknowledged there were deficiencies identified in the company’s operations in the Commission of Inquiry’s report.
The company said drilling supervisors and management associated with the incident have been removed from their positions with the company.
According to a company spokesman, the Action Plan will "ensure the full accountability of key personnel to give greater oversight for reporting and checking of all critical offshore operations. This will strengthen the integrity and safety of drilling operations".&lt;ref name="acplim"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.au.pttep.com/news/2010/november/pttepaa-media-release-24-november |title=Action Plan implemented to ensure oil field safety |date=24 November 2010 |publisher=PTTEP Australasia |accessdate=18 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The West Triton jackup drilling rig arrived at the Montara Field in an attempt to plug the oil leak on 11 September 2009.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.news.com.au/perthnow/story/0,27574,26059755-2761,00.html Finally, help arrives at stricken West Atlas oil rig]", The Sunday Times.&lt;/ref&gt;  Oil and gas producer, [[Woodside Petroleum]] Ltd offered to assist PTTEPAA in cleaning up the oil spill with the use of a rig closer to the spill site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title = Woodside offers oil spill assistance |url = http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2009/08/25/2666168.htm |work = [[ABC News (Australia)|ABC News]] |date = 25 August 2009 |accessdate = 5 November 2009 |archiveurl = https://www.webcitation.org/5l3SIQu0e |archivedate = 5 November 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, PTTEPAA rejected the Woodside offer on the basis of "safety reasons".&lt;ref name=ABC5&gt;{{cite news |title = Oil spill company rejects Woodside offer |url = http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2009/08/30/2670993.htm |work = [[ABC News (Australia)|ABC News]] |date = 30 August 2009 |accessdate = 5 November 2009 |archiveurl = https://www.webcitation.org/5l3SLUU45 |archivedate = 5 November 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Woodside rig was a semisubmersible drilling rig and, as it floats on the sea surface, was not deemed as a suitable platform for the relief well.

In July 2010, a PTTEPAA team reboarded the well head platform to pressure test all the wells.

==Environmental effects==
The Australian Government in November 2010 released the first results of an independent scientific studies conducted under the long-term environmental monitoring program being funded by PTTEPAA under an agreement with the Australian Government announced in October 2009.&lt;ref name="pttep2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.au.pttep.com/news/2010/november/pttepaa-media-release-19-november-2010-1600hrs-wst |title=Montara Environmental Monitoring Program Delivers First Findings |date=19 November 2010 |publisher=PTTEP Australasia |accessdate=18 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The scientific studies issued by the Australian Department of Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities (DSEWPaC) on 19 November 2010 found that no oil reached the Australian mainland or Indonesian coast and the maximum surface area of the ocean that had hydrocarbons on it on any one given day during the spill was 11,183 square kilometres.&lt;ref name="pttep2"/&gt;
The Australian Government sought independent expert advice on the detail of the environmental monitoring program from organisations such as the Australian Institute of Marine Science, the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) and State and Territory agencies.
Each scientific study conducted under the program is subject to a detailed review by a DSEWPaC technical advisory board.
PTTEPAA will fund the comprehensive monitoring program for at least two years, with some studies expected to continue up to five years or longer if required to provide data to measure and address any longer-term impacts should they occur.
A PTTEPAA spokesperson said "the commitment to run some of the studies beyond two years does not necessarily indicate long-term impacts but supports the recommendations of independent experts to ensure the best science is in place to monitor the marine environment".
The spokesperson said the studies are creating a body of high quality scientific baseline data in key areas of the Timor Sea marine environment which will be an asset for the industry and the community in managing activities in the region.&lt;ref name="pttep2"/&gt;

Biologists said that the effects of the Montara oil spill could be catastrophic for [[marine ecosystems]], with claims that although it is a lightweight [[crude oil]] spilling from the platform, it can still have toxic effects on birds, [[marine invertebrates]], [[coral]] and [[marine algae]].&lt;ref name=Buckeridge/&gt; [[The Wilderness Society (Australia)|The Wilderness Society]] described the area as a "marine superhighway", and [[whales]] and endangered [[flatback turtle]]s observed in the area are at risk from the spill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title = Oil slick endangers whales, turtles |first = Narelle |last = Towie |url = http://www.news.com.au/perthnow/story/0,21598,25998853-5017007,00.html |work = [[The Sunday Times (Western Australia)|PerthNow]] |date = 29 August 2009 |accessdate = 5 November 2009 |archiveurl = https://www.webcitation.org/5l3XjUVKg |archivedate = 5 November 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; By 3 September 2009, fishers observed sick and dying marine life, and an absence of birds in the spill area.&lt;ref name=ABC3/&gt; The [[World Wildlife Fund]] (WWF) observed [[spinner dolphin]]s, [[sooty tern]]s, [[Hydrophis ornatus|spotted sea snake]] and threatened [[hawksbill turtle|hawksbill]] and [[flatback turtle]]s swimming in the oil slick, and expressed concern about long-term effects.

=== West Timor, Indonesia ===
Indonesian fishermen have claimed that the spill and response polluted their national waters, killed thousands of fish and caused skin diseases&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.abc.net.au/news/2014-07-15/indonesian-fishermen-want-montara-oil-spill-investigation/5598650|title = Indonesian fishermen want Montara oil spill investigated|last = James|first = Felicity|date = 2014-07-15|work = |accessdate = 2014-12-06|last2 = Brann|first2 = Matt|publisher = ABC}}&lt;/ref&gt; and loss of human life. [[Non-governmental organization|NGOs]] in [[Indonesia]] expressed concern about the oil spill's effects on the Indonesian environment and traditional fishing grounds as the oil spill drifted towards the islands of [[Timor]] and [[Sumba]]. The Montara oil field is situated south of Indonesia's Pasir Island, a popular fishing location for many [[East Nusa Tenggara]] fishermen.

The extent of the spread of the oil slick and sheen into Indonesian waters is disputed. Maps obtained by the [[Australian Lawyers Alliance]] under the Freedom of Information Act suggested that oil could have come as close as 37&amp;nbsp;km to the southern coast of Rote. The [[Australian Maritime Safety Authority]] advised that while figures on the maps were accurate, the maps were not drawn to scale so distances could not be visually interpreted. PTTEP maintains that the slick remained 94&amp;nbsp;km distant from Indonesia and was primarily contained within a 23&amp;nbsp;km radius of the drilling platform.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/breaking-news/secret-maps-shed-light-on-montara-spill/story-fni0xqlk-1227100481587?nk=cda22362a15a4871829a3d1e9a82f811|title = Montara maps push case for more study|last = Dunlevy|first = Gabrielle|date = 2014-10-24|work = |accessdate = 2014-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2010, fishermen claimed to have observed dramatic declines in the number of [[red snapper (fish)|red snapper]] caught by Indonesians, with 7,000 fishers impacted by loss of income,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title = Indonesia hit by Timor Sea spill: NGO |url = http://news.theage.com.au/breaking-news-world/indonesia-hit-by-timor-sea-spill-ngo-20091102-htc1.html |agency = [[Agence France-Presse]] |newspaper = [[The Age]] |date = 2 November 2009 |accessdate = 5 November 2009 |archiveurl = https://www.webcitation.org/5l3Yc7oS6 |archivedate = 5 November 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; including cases of bankruptcy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title = Oil spill sends fishermen bankrupt |url = http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2009/11/07/2736012.htm?site=news |agency = [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] |date = 2 November 2009 |accessdate = 6 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Declining fish catches have forced thousands of fishermen to find new livelihoods on other islands as distant as the [[Bangka–Belitung Islands]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Timor Sea Oil Spill Forcing NTT Fishermen to Migrate | url = http://www.thejakartaglobe.com/home/timor-sea-oil-spill-forcing-ntt-fishermen-to-migrate/382331 | work = [[Jakarta Globe]] | agency = [[Antara (news agency)|Antara]] | date = 24 June 2010 | accessdate = 24 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 10 November, video emerged of Indonesian fisherman and scuba divers holding dead fish whilst in the water amongst the oil slick. The footage was allegedly taken whilst in Indonesian waters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title = Video could prove oil reached Timor coast |url = http://www.news.com.au/perthnow/story/0,21598,26331708-950,00.html |publisher = The Sunday Times |accessdate = 10 November 2009 | date=10 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[West Timor Care Foundation]] received reports on the death of eight people and 30 poisonous cases after the consumption of fish in the waters around areas allegedly contaminated by oil and chemical dispersant. As of October 2010, the foundation was the only Indonesian NGO to file a legal action with the Australian independent investigation commission into the Montara spill.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.antaranews.com/en/news/1288540844/australia-contaminates-indonesia-sea-with-toxic-chemicals|title = Australia contaminates Indonesia sea with toxic chemicals|last = |first = |date = 2010-10-31|work = |accessdate = 2014-12-06|publisher = Antara News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Australian Lawyers Alliance has argued that in absence of sub-surface sampling of oil and chemical disperant, the spread of contamination and the environmental consequences of the spill can not be fully understood. The organisation has called for further investigation, suggesting that if Australian livelihoods had been affected there would be public outrage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.abc.net.au/news/2014-08-21/montara-oil-spill/5685842|title = Montara oil spill: Fishermen's lawyer calls for investigation into reports of skin disease|last = James|first = Felicity|date = 2014-08-21|work = |accessdate = 2014-12-07|publisher = ABC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

East Nusa Tenggara governor Frans Leburaya said Australia and the operator of the oil field should be held responsible for any environmental damage caused by the oil spill.&lt;ref name="thejakartapost"&gt;{{cite news |title = Oil spill pollutes Timor Sea, nears Indonesian waters |first = Yemris |last = Fointuna |url = http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2009/09/29/oil-spill-pollutes-timor-sea-nears-indonesian-waters.html |newspaper = [[The Jakarta Post]] |date = 29 September 2009 |accessdate = 5 November 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2010, the East Nusa Tenggara provincial government estimated that economic losses due to the pollution of the Timor Sea resulting from the Montara spill amounted to more than 2.5-3 trillion rupiah (Rp) or $318–382 million (AUD). The loss was born exclusively by the fishermen and coastal residents whose living was dependent on marine resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://wikileaks.org/gifiles/docs/80/801032_idn-indonesia-asia-pacific-.html|title = The Global Intelligence Files - IDN/INDONESIA/ASIA PACIFIC|date = 2010-06-15|accessdate = 2014-12-07|website = Wikileaks|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Indonesian president, [[Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono]] announced that the Indonesian government would seek compensation from PTTEPAA because he believed the lives of Indonesian seaweed farmers and fishermen had been affected by the oil spill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title = Indonesia seeks Montara leak compensation |url = http://www.upi.com/Science_News/Resource-Wars/2010/07/22/Indonesia-seeks-Montara-leak-compensation/UPI-68571279821576/ |agency = [[United Press International]] |date = 22 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

PTTEP Australia has stated that independent studies published by the Australian Department for the Environment found that 98.6 per cent of Montara oil stayed in Australian waters, and that the company has received "no credible evidence of damage to the environment in West Timor."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== East Timor ===
[[East Timor]]ese President, Dr [[José Ramos-Horta]], said that the Australian government and the Thai company that own the platform are responsible for the spill, and that he will seek compensation for damage caused by the spill to his country's environment. Ramos-Horta called for Australian environmental organisations to help assess whether the spill has caused damage to East Timor's maritime area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title = East Timor wants compo for oil spill fallout |url = http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2009/11/05/2734579.htm |agency = [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] |date = 5 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Wildlife impact monitoring==
To assist in planning and executing the spill response, the Australian Government commenced an environmental monitoring program comprising a series of operational studies, including a wildlife monitoring program.&lt;ref name="opmost"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.environment.gov.au/coasts/oilspill/operational-monitoring.html|title=Montara Oil spill - Operational monitoring studies|publisher=|accessdate=24 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The wildlife monitoring program sought to locate, assess and treat oil affected wildlife found in the region of the spill. Carcasses of oil affected wildlife were retained and tested to determine their cause of death.
Studies undertaken under this program by Associate Professor Marthe Monique Gagnon and Dr Christopher Rawson from Curtin University in Western Australia, involved testing of four fish specimens collected in the vicinity of the spill. Tests were also conducted on 16 birds, two sea snakes and one green turtle collected in the region of the oil spill.
Results announced in November 2010 found that two of the birds (both common noddies) had been affected by oil, one internally and the second both internally and externally. The study also found that the 14 remaining birds had no traces of oil. The poor physical condition of the remaining birds suggests that they likely died of natural causes.
Tests on the horned sea snake indicated it had been affected by oil; however, positive hydrocarbon readings were only detected in its stomach contents. This suggests the sea snake was indirectly exposed to oil through ingesting prey.
Tests on the sea turtle found no positive results for hydrocarbons, which indicated oil exposure was not the cause of death.&lt;ref name="opmost"/&gt;

'''Shoreline ecological assessment – Study S2'''
This independent study, led by Dr Norm Duke of the University of Queensland, aimed to collect baseline information on habitats and species found along Australia’s north-west coast between Broome in Western Australia and Darwin in the Northern Territory.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.environment.gov.au/coasts/oilspill.html Montara Oil spill] {{webarchive |url=https://www.webcitation.org/5l3Y4jHxb?url=http://www.environment.gov.au/coasts/oilspill.html |date=5 November 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
During November 2009, aerial surveys were undertaken covering more than 5,000&amp;nbsp;km of shoreline.
The study findings are consistent with those released in July 2010 by the Environmental Protection Authority of Western Australia (EPA) from an independent survey of the Kimberley shoreline conducted in October–November 2009 which found no oil issued during the Montara incident reached the Western Australian coast.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;http://edit.epa.wa.gov.au/EPADocLib/MTR3-2010-Kimberley%20BL%20Hydrocarbons.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  The EPA surveyed 16 Kimberley island shorelines and two mainland promontories between Camden Sound and the Stewart Islands.  The EPA found that no hydrocarbons were detected in any water or shoreline samples and analyses of rock oyster and cultured pearl oyster show no evidence of in situ contamination.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

'''Oil Fate and Effects Assessment - Trajectory Analysis Study S7.1'''
This study was undertaken by Asia-Pacific ASA, an Australian company that specialises in modelling, mapping and assessing spill events throughout the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asascience.com/services/oil-gas/index.shtml ASA &amp;#124; Applied Science Associates :: Oil and Gas Services]&lt;/ref&gt;
Headed by senior oceanographer Dr Brian King and senior chemist and environmental scientist Trevor Gilbert, the S7.1 study combined sightings of oil with modelling data to produce a picture of the likely extent of the spill. The results of this study will be used so that future scientific monitoring covers appropriate areas. This study used trajectory modelling, overflight data and satellite images to gain an almost hourly understanding of the spill.
This study reported, in part, that no oil reached the Australian mainland or Indonesian coast. The greatest occurrence of oil was within 22.8&amp;nbsp;kilometres of the release site. Beyond 22.8&amp;nbsp;kilometres, the hydrocarbons were predominantly sheens/waxy films and of short duration. 98.6 per cent of occurrences of hydrocarbons on surface were within Australian waters.&lt;ref name="pttep2"/&gt;
King’s oil fate and effects studies also used reports from the World Wildlife Fund (WWF), all submissions made to the Montara Commission of Inquiry and related transcripts, as well as Australian and Indonesian media reports of oil locations.
Combination of all these datasets with scientific modelling ensured the most accurate and objective description of the movement of hydrocarbons in the Timor Sea throughout the incident, Dr King said. Satellite imagery used in Asia-Pacific ASA’s assessments were the same used by the WWF and oil spill tracker Skytruth, with additional high resolution imagery from LANDSAT. These combined techniques gave Dr King the highest degree of confidence in providing detailed modelling, analysis and mapping of the spill event.&lt;ref name="pttep3"&gt;http://www.au.pttep.com/uploads/APASA%20Media%20Release%2025112010.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Oil Fate and Effects Assessment - Dispersant Oil Modelling Study S7.2'''
After using chemical dispersants to accelerate the natural breakdown of oil during the Montara incident, the Australian Government sought to find out the fate of the dispersed oil once it was in the
water column. This study aimed to determine the potential concentrations of dispersed oil under the water surface using computer modelling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.environment.gov.au/coasts/oilspill.html#monitoringstudies|title=Montara Oil spill|publisher=|accessdate=24 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The S7.2 study undertaken by specialist company ASA-Pacific reported, in part the chemical dispersant application caused increased hydrocarbon concentrations in the water column, mostly within the first metre of the water column.  However, these concentrations reduced quickly with time, depth and distance from the dispersant application site and no dispersed oil reached the Australian mainland or Indonesian coast.&lt;ref name="pttep2"/&gt;

The study found that under the worst-case scenario dispersed oil from three of the spraying operations may have reached the Goerree and Barracouta shoals. Because of these findings, a further study—the Scientific Monitoring Study 5 Offshore Banks Assessment Survey—will be undertaken.&lt;ref name="environment1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.environment.gov.au/coasts/oilspill/scientific-monitoring.html|title=Montara Oil spill - Scientific Monitoring Studies|publisher=|accessdate=24 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Dispersant Study S7.2 research relied on the Australian Maritime Safety Authority’s field monitoring of dispersed oil concentrations to validate S7.2 modelling. Where field data was unavailable, Asia-Pacific ASA took a "conservative approach" to modelling was taken and potential dispersed oil concentrations were overestimated to ensure further investigation by independent field monitoring teams from Western Australian Department of Fisheries and the Australian Institute of Marine Science.&lt;ref name="pttep3"/&gt;

'''Further studies'''
The scientific studies triggered under the Montara Long Term Environmental Monitoring Program comprise:
Shoreline Ecological Assessment Aerial Surveys (study S2);
Assessments of Fish Catch for the Presence of Oil (study S3);
Assessments of Effects on Timor Sea Fish and Fisheries (study S4);

==Cause and investigation==
PTTEPAA stated shortly after the leak was plugged that they had a theory about the cause of the leak but would not disclose nor confirm the cause until they had access to the Montara Wellhead Platform and could present a thorough appraisal.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.skynews.com.au/eco/article.aspx?id=390331 Govt pledges oil leak inquiry.]"{{Failed verification|date=November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 5 November 2009, a [[Commission of Inquiry]] into the oil leak was announced. The inquiry, led by David Borthwick, had nearly all the powers of a [[Royal Commission]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.montarainquiry.gov.au/index.html Montara Inquiry - Home]&lt;/ref&gt; The report was to be presented by the end of April 2010;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title = David Borthwick to head oil spill inquiry |url = http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,25197,26308660-26103,00.html |agency = [[Australian Associated Press]] |newspaper = [[The Australian]] |date = 5 November 2009 |accessdate = 5 November 2009 |archiveurl = https://www.webcitation.org/5l34Q9yQ6 |archivedate = 5 November 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |title = Minister Announces Details of Montara Commission of Inquiry |url = http://minister.ret.gov.au/TheHonMartinFergusonMP/Pages/MINISTERANNOUNCESDETAILSOFMONTARACOMMISSIONOFINQUIRY.aspx |publisher = The Hon Martin Ferguson AM MP |date = 5 November 2009 |accessdate = 5 November 2009 |archiveurl = https://www.webcitation.org/5l34ZhVsZ |archivedate = 5 November 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the commission delayed their report, however, until 18 June to further examine the causes and effects of the spill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wwf.panda.org/wwf_news/?193129/As-US-oil-spill-worsens-Australia-delays-report |title=As US oil spill worsens, Australia delays report |publisher=[[World Wide Fund for Nature]] |date=5 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/03/us/03montara.html?src=mv |title=Relief Well Was Used to Halt Australian Spill |publisher=New York Times |author=Bradsher, Keith |date=2 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the spill in August 2009 Martin Ferguson has signed 120 new gas and oil exploration licenses but has still not imposed any regulations on deep sea oil drilling.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

Elmer Danenberger, who used to be in charge of regulatory affairs for the U.S. Minerals Management Service, claimed that Halliburton had done a poor job [[cementing equipment|cementing]], a process that is supposed to fill the gaps around the [[Casing (borehole)|casing]] with cement to prevent leaks of oil and gas, probably causing the spill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703572504575214593564769072|title=Drilling Process Attracts Scrutiny in Rig Explosion|work=The Wall Street Journal|date=30 April 2010|first1 = Russell |last1 = Gold | first2 = Ben |last2 =Casselman}}&lt;/ref&gt;
On 24 November 2010, Australian Resources and Energy Minister Martin Ferguson released the Report of the Montara Commission of Inquiry and a draft response from the Australian Government.
The Report contained 100 findings and 105 recommendations. The Australian Government proposed accepting 92, noting 10, and not accepting three of the Report’s recommendations.
Commissioner David Borthwick’s final report stated that while the source of the blowout was largely uncontested it was most likely that hydrocarbons entered the H1 Well through its 9⅝" cemented casing shoe and flowed up the inside of its 9⅝" casing. The Inquiry found that the primary well control barrier – the 9⅝" cemented casing shoe – failed.
The final report by the Commission commended the spill response efforts by PTTEPAA, the Australian Maritime Safety Authority in its role as Combat Agency and the then Department of Environment, Water, Heritage and the Arts for its role as environmental regulator.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ret.gov.au/Department/Documents/MIR/Montara-Report.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Minister Ferguson said the failure of the operator and regulator to adhere to Australia’s oil and gas regulatory regime was a key factor in the Montara incident.&lt;ref&gt;[http://minister.ret.gov.au/MediaCentre/MediaReleases/Pages/FinalReportoftheMontaraCommissionofInquiryReleased.aspx Final Report of the Montara Commission of Inquiry Released]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal action and resolutions==
Representatives from PTTEPAA held meetings with Indonesian government officials in Perth Western Australia on 27 July and 26 August 2010, to discuss the Indonesian government’s claim for compensation.&lt;ref name="meovin"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.au.pttep.com/news/2010/august-/pttepaa-media-release-26-august-2010 |title=Meeting over Indonesian oil impact claims |date=26 August 2010 |publisher=PTTEP Australasia |accessdate=18 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 2 September 2010, PTTEPAA stated it did not accept any claim because no verifiable scientific evidence had been presented to the company to support the summary of claims presented by the Indonesian government.&lt;ref name="pdna"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.au.pttep.com/news/2010/september/pttepaa-media-release-2-september-2010 |title=PTTEPAA does not accept compensation claim |date=2 September 2010 |publisher=PTTEP Australasia |accessdate=18 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2010, PTTEPAA announced its commitment to the Australian Government to fund a range of scientific studies aimed at determining any environmental impacts from the incident.&lt;ref name="bema"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.au.pttep.com/news/2009/september/backgrounder-%E2%80%93-environmental-monitoring-action |title=Backgrounder – Environmental Monitoring Action |date=12 September 2009 |publisher=PTTEP Australasia |accessdate=18 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Commission during its inquiry took into account measures which could have been implemented to mitigate environmental damage.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.montarainquiry.gov.au/downloads/Commission%20of%20Inquiry_ToR.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2011 PTT Exploration &amp; Production Pcl (PTTEP) was cleared to keep operating in Australian waters after satisfying the Australian government that it had taken steps to prevent a repeat of the Montara blowout.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://wikileaks.org/gifiles/docs/29/2960370_-os-australia-energy-conocophillips-outlines-proposal-for.html|title = The Global Intelligence Files - [OS] AUSTRALIA/ENERGY - ConocoPhillips Outlines Proposal for Exploration Drilling Off Australia|date = 2011-05-17|accessdate = 2014-12-07|website = Wikileaks|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, PTTEP Australasia pleaded guilty to charges under the ''Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Act'' and was fined $510,000.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

As of 2014, the fishermen of West Timor are represented by lawyer Greg Phelps with the support of the Indonesian government. Phelps believes an independent investigation into the oil spill's environmental and economic impact in Indonesia is necessary.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In August 2016, a class action suit was filed in Sydney, Australia representing the interests of over 13,000 Indonesian seaweed farmers whose livelihoods were affected by the spill and subsequent clean-up activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2016/08/03/indonesian-farmers-file-class-action-suit-against-montara-over-2009-oil-spill.html|title=Indonesian farmers file class-action suit against Montara over 2009 oil spill|last=Gunawan Sulistiyono|first=Arif|date=2016-08-03|website=|publisher=The Jakarta Post|access-date=2016-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:N-acyl amide 2.tif|thumbnail]]

'''N-acyl amides''' are a general class of endogenous fatty acid compounds characterized by a fatty acyl group linked to a primary amine metabolite by an amide bond. Broadly speaking, N-acyl amides fall into several categories: amino acid conjugates (e.g., N-arachidonoyl-glycine), neurotransmitter conjugates (e.g., N-arachidonoyl-serotonin), ethanolamine conjugates (e.g., [[anandamide]]), and taurine conjugates (e.g., N-palmitoyl-taurine). N-acyl amides have pleiotropic signaling functions in physiology, including in cardiovascular function, metabolic homeostasis, memory, cognition, pain, motor control and others.&lt;ref name="pmid15655504"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bradshaw HB, Walker JM | title = The expanding field of cannabimimetic and related lipid mediators | journal = British Journal of Pharmacology | volume = 144 | issue = 4 | pages = 459–65 | date = February 2005 | pmid = 15655504 | pmc = 1576036 | doi = 10.1038/sj.bjp.0706093 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Initial attention focused on N-acyl amides present in mammalian organisms, however recently lipid signaling systems consisting of N-acyl amides have also been found to be present in invertebrates, such as Drosophila melanogaster.&lt;ref name="Tortoriello"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tortoriello G, Rhodes BP, Takacs SM, Stuart JM, Basnet A, Raboune S, Widlanski TS, Doherty P, Harkany T, Bradshaw HB | title = Targeted lipidomics in Drosophila melanogaster identifies novel 2-monoacylglycerols and N-acyl amides | journal = PLOS ONE | volume = 8 | issue = 7 | pages = e67865 | date = 2013 | pmid = 23874457 | pmc = 3708943 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0067865 | bibcode = 2013PLoSO...867865T }}&lt;/ref&gt; N-acyl amides play important roles in many biochemical pathways involved in a variety of physiological and pathological processes, as well as the metabolic enzymes, transporters, and receptors that regulate their signaling.

==Enzymatic biosynthesis and degradation==

The enzymatic biosynthesis of the N-acyl amide class of metabolites is a topic of active research with various pathways being discovered for specific N-acyl amides. For example, a proposed biosynthetic pathway for the N-acyl ethanolamines (NAEs) has been the hydrolysis of an unusual phospholipid precursor, N-acyl-phosphatidylethanolamine (NAPE), by a phospholipase D activity to liberate NAE and, as a byproduct, phosphatidic acid. Mice deficient in the enzyme NAPE-PLD show decreased in a subset of brain NAEs, providing genetic evidence for this proposal, at least for a subset of the NAEs. Other biosynthetic pathways likely exist, but the enzymes catalyzing these reactions have not yet been identified.

The degradation of NAEs in vivo is largely mediated by an enzyme called fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH), which catalyzes the hydrolysis of NAEs into fatty acids and ethanolamine. Mice deficient in FAAH show complete loss of NAE degradation activity in tissues and dramatic elevations in tissue levels of NAEs.

FAAH also mediates the degradation of a separate class of N-acyl amides, the N-acyl taurines (NATs). FAAH knockout mice also show dramatic increases in tissue and blood NATs. The enzymatic biosynthesis of NATs remains unknown.

A distinct circulating enzyme, peptidase M20 domain containing 1 ([[PM20D1 (gene)|PM20D1]]), can catalyze the bidirectional the condensation and hydrolysis of a variety of N-acyl amino acids in vitro. In vivo, PM20D1 overexpression increases the levels of various N-acyl amino acids in blood, demonstrating that this enzyme can contribute to N-acyl amino acid biosynthesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Long JZ, Svensson KJ, Bateman LA, Lin H, Kamenecka T, Lokurkar IA, Lou J, Rao RR, Chang MR, Jedrychowski MP, Paulo JA, Gygi SP, Griffin PR, Nomura DK, Spiegelman BM | title = The Secreted Enzyme PM20D1 Regulates Lipidated Amino Acid Uncouplers of Mitochondria | journal = Cell | volume = 166 | issue = 2 | pages = 424–435 | date = July 2016 | pmid = 27374330 | pmc = 4947008 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2016.05.071 }}&lt;/ref&gt; PM20D1 knockout mice have complete loss of N-acyl amino acid hydrolysis activity in blood and tissues with concomitant bidirectional dysregulation of endogenous N-acyl amino acids.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Long JZ, Roche AM, Berdan CA, Louie SM, Roberts AJ, Svensson KJ, Dou FY, Bateman LA, Mina AI, Deng Z, Jedrychowski MP, Lin H, Kamenecka TM, Asara JM, Griffin PR, Banks AS, Nomura DK, Spiegelman BM | title = N-acyl amino acid control of metabolism and nociception | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 115 | issue = 29 | pages = E6937–E6945 | date = July 2018 | pmid = 29967167 | pmc = 6055169 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1803389115 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biological Activity==

N-acyl amides have been shown to play an important role in a variety of physiological functions as lipid signaling molecule. Apart from the aforementioned roles in cardiovascular function, memory, cognition, pain, and motor control, the compounds have also been shown to play a role in cell migration, inflammation and certain pathological conditions such as diabetes, cancer, neurodegenerative disease, and obesity.&lt;ref name="Waluk" /&gt;

In a more general sense, one of the key characteristics of the N-acyl amide group of compounds is their ubiquitous nature. Research has shown the presence of the compounds in mice, ''Drosophila melanogaster, Arabidopsis, C. Elegans, Cerevisiae (yeast), Pseudomonas Syringae'', olive oil and PYD media&lt;ref&gt;Bradshaw, Heather B.,Leishman, Emma. “Expanding the range of potential “endogenous cannabinoids” to incorporate lipids in bacteria, yeast, worms, and flies: cannabimimetic lipids are not just from arachidonic acid anymore.”  IRCS Poster Presentation. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;
. This diverse presence of N-acyl amides attests to their importance in multiple biological systems and also shows that the detected presence of specific N-acyl amides in a number of species, including humans, may be endogenous or exogenous.

N-acyl amides are primarily involved in cell-to-cell communication in biological systems. An example of this is the lipid signaling system involving transient receptor potential channels (TRP), which interact with N-acyl amides such as N-arachidonoyl ethanolamide (Anandamide), N-arachidonoyl dopamine and others in an opportunistic fashion.&lt;ref name="pmid23178153"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bradshaw HB, Raboune S, Hollis JL | title = Opportunistic activation of TRP receptors by endogenous lipids: exploiting lipidomics to understand TRP receptor cellular communication | journal = Life Sciences | volume = 92 | issue = 8–9 | pages = 404–9 | date = March 2013 | pmid = 23178153 | pmc = 3587287 | doi = 10.1016/j.lfs.2012.11.008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This signaling system has been shown to play a role in the physiological processes involved in inflammation.&lt;ref name="pmid25136293"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Raboune S, Stuart JM, Leishman E, Takacs SM, Rhodes B, Basnet A, Jameyfield E, McHugh D, Widlanski T, Bradshaw HB | title = Novel endogenous N-acyl amides activate TRPV1-4 receptors, BV-2 microglia, and are regulated in brain in an acute model of inflammation | journal = Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience | volume = 8 | issue = | pages = 195 | date = 2014 | pmid = 25136293 | pmc = 4118021 | doi = 10.3389/fncel.2014.00195 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other N-acyl amides, including N-oleoyl-glutamine, have also been characterized as TRP channel antagonists.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

An application of N-acyl amides that is currently at the forefront of related research is the correlation between oleoyl serine and bone remodeling. Recent research has shown that oleoyl serine, an N-acyl amide found in olive oil amongst other sources, plays a role in the proliferation of osteoblast activity and the inhibition of osteoclast activity.&lt;ref name="pmid20876113"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Smoum R, Bar A, Tan B, Milman G, Attar-Namdar M, Ofek O, Stuart JM, Bajayo A, Tam J, Kram V, O'Dell D, Walker MJ, Bradshaw HB, Bab I, Mechoulam R | title = Oleoyl serine, an endogenous N-acyl amide, modulates bone remodeling and mass | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 107 | issue = 41 | pages = 17710–5 | date = October 2010 | pmid = 20876113 | pmc = 2955099 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0912479107 | bibcode = 2010PNAS..10717710S }}&lt;/ref&gt; Further research regarding this application of oleoyl serine is set to take place to explore the possible correlation between the consumption of the compound by individuals at risk for osteoporosis.

Certain N-acyl amino acids can act as [[Dinitrophenol|chemical uncouplers]] and directly stimulate [[Mitochondrion|mitochondrial]] respiration. These N-acyl amino acids are characterized by medium chain, unsaturated fatty acyl chains and neutral amino acid head groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lin H, Long JZ, Roche AM, Svensson KJ, Dou FY, Chang MR, Strutzenberg T, Ruiz C, Cameron MD, Novick SJ, Berdan CA, Louie SM, Nomura DK, Spiegelman BM, Griffin PR, Kamenecka TM | title = Discovery of Hydrolysis-Resistant Isoindoline N-Acyl Amino Acid Analogues that Stimulate Mitochondrial Respiration | journal = Journal of Medicinal Chemistry | volume = 61 | issue = 7 | pages = 3224–3230 | date = April 2018 | pmid = 29533650 | doi = 10.1021/acs.jmedchem.8b00029 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Administration of these N-acyl amino acids to mice elevates energy expenditure leading to profound body weight loss and improvement of glucose homeostasis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Long JZ, Svensson KJ, Bateman LA, Lin H, Kamenecka T, Lokurkar IA, Lou J, Rao RR, Chang MR, Jedrychowski MP, Paulo JA, Gygi SP, Griffin PR, Nomura DK, Spiegelman BM | display-authors = 6 | title = The Secreted Enzyme PM20D1 Regulates Lipidated Amino Acid Uncouplers of Mitochondria | journal = Cell | volume = 166 | issue = 2 | pages = 424–435 | date = July 2016 | pmid = 27374330 | pmc = 4947008 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2016.05.071 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Overall, the applications of N-acyl amides in biological settings are abundant. As mentioned, their importance in cell signaling in a variety systems leading to various physiological roles and in turn therapeutic capabilities, which gives all the more reason to continue the extensive research being conducted on the compounds today.

Several N-acyl amides have been demonstrated to physiologically activate G-protein coupled receptors. Anandamide activates the cannabinoid receptors CB1 and CB2. FAAH knockout mice show increased anandamide levels in vivo and cannabinoid-receptor dependent behaviors including antinociception and anxiolysis. GPR18, GPR55, GPR92 have also been proposed to be activated by various N-acyl amides, though the physiological relevance of these assignments remains unknown.

==Cast==
The film was narrated by [[Peter Coyote]] and features interviews with and footage of [[environmentalists]] [[Amory Lovins]], [[Celia Hunter]], [[Sarah James]], [[Norma Kassi]], former Alaska Governor [[Tony Knowles (politician)|Tony Knowles]], former Alaska Senator [[Ted Stevens]], California Senator [[Barbara Boxer]], former [[Sierra Club]] director [[Carl Pope (environmentalist)|Carl Pope]], Ken Whitten, David Klein, former [[Fairbanks North Star Borough]] Mayor [[Jim Whitaker]], former [[North Slope Borough]] Mayor George N. Ahmaogak, and Inupiaq activist and former [[Nuiqsut]] mayor Rosemary Ahtuangaruak.

==Production==
''Oil on Ice'' was sponsored by Northern Alaska Environmental Center (NAEC) and was filmed on location in [[Alaska]], [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]], and [[Washington, DC]].&lt;ref name="DVDVer"&gt;Engebretson, Russell (August 25th, 2005).[http://www.dvdverdict.com/reviews/oilonice.php  ''Oil on Ice''] review.  DVDVerdict.com&lt;/ref&gt;  To promote and market the film, Steve Michelson engaged fourteen non-profit organizations, including the [[Sierra Club]], members of which hosted thousands of house parties to screen and distribute materials about the film, and to promote grassroots efforts to prevent ANWR drilling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Shooting in the Wild: An Insider's Account of Making Movies in the Animal Kingdom|page= 24 | first=Chris |last=Palmer |year= 2010 |publisher=Sierra Club Books|isbn= 978-1578051489 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Op2Jb6xopDgC&amp;pg=PA24#v=onepage&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Release===
The film premiered at [[Mountainfilm in Telluride]] on May 31, 2004, and was released on DVD September 6, 2005.&lt;ref name="DVDVer"/&gt;  The soundtrack CD ''[[Oil on Ice (soundtrack)|Oil on Ice]]'' by [[William Susman]], featuring cellist [[Joan Jeanrenaud]], was released on October 16, 2007.

==Reception==
FilmCritic.com reviewer Eric Meyerson described the film as "unabashed counter-propaganda to the pro-drilling forces" seeking access to wilderness land. He credits its professional production and its "powerful story, with astonishing wildlife photography and fascinating and tragic tales of the plights of local fishermen and native tribes."  Meyerson found the interviews with Gwich'in Indian Adeline Peter Raboff "particularly affecting." He noted that the film is "as one-sided as the ''[[O'Reilly Factor]]''" in that it  "failed to address any positive economic impacts that the oil industry has had on Alaskans."  But he termed the film "well-made counter-propaganda. If anything, ''Oil on Ice'' is worth seeing just to see exactly what ExxonMobil and CononoPhillips are getting ready to tear into."&lt;ref name="FilmCritic"/&gt;&lt;!-- cite for whole paragraph --&gt;

Russell Engebretson, writing for DVDVerdict,  wrote of its "beautiful Alaskan wildlife cinematography, including one truly stunning shot of a grazing [[Caribou]] herd that must have numbered in the thousands. For contrast, we get an aerial view of the massive, grotesque [[Prudhoe Bay]] drilling operation that abuts ANWR to the west."   He noted that while the "wilderness scenery is delightful, there is ample interview material as well." Of the many interviewees, he found that two, Pope and Levin, "drag down the film", and that Levin "steers the film away from its central thesis — the exploitation of ANWR."  Engebretson felt that the documentary erred in two ways: "by lionizing people who don't deserve such treatment", and "in presenting [John] Kerry as a foe of Big Oil". Summarizing, he found the film to be "a good, basic introduction (from an anti-drilling point-of-view) to the oil extraction debate."&lt;ref name="DVDVer"/&gt;&lt;!-- cite for whole paragraph --&gt;

==Awards==
''Oil on Ice'' received several awards: the 2004 [[International Documentary Association]] ''Pare Lorentz Award'' for best representing the "democratic sensibility, activist spirit and lyrical vision" of [[Pare Lorentz]],&lt;ref name="Variety"/&gt; the 2005 Missoula [[International Wildlife Film Festival]] ''Festival Prize'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=2005 Award Winners |publisher=[[International Wildlife Film Festival]]  |url=http://www.wildlifefilms.org/festival/awards_cf.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050411014827/http://www.wildlifefilms.org/festival/awards_cf.htm |archivedate=2005-04-11 |accessdate=2011-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; the 2005 [[Moondance International Film Festival]] ''Calypso Award'' for feature documentary and ''Seahorse Award'' for best film score,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Congratulations Moondance 2005 Winners |publisher=Moondance Film Festival |url=http://www.moondancefilmfestival.com/05-Winners.html | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060326043358/http://www.moondancefilmfestival.com/05-Winners.html |archivedate=2006-03-26 |accessdate=2011-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the 2006 Park City Film Music Festival ''Gold Medal for Excellence'' in the category Documentary, Jury Choice: Best Impact of Music.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pcfmf.com/past.html Past Festivals].

An '''Otto cycle''' is an   idealized [[thermodynamic cycle]] that describes the functioning of a typical [[spark ignition engine|spark ignition]] [[piston engine]]. It is the thermodynamic cycle most commonly found in automobile engines.&lt;ref&gt;Wu, Chih.'' [https://books.google.com.ph/books/about/Thermodynamic_Cycles.html?id=2kr26tu9MaMC&amp;redir_esc=y Thermodynamic Cycles: Computer-aided Design and Optimization]''. New York: M. Dekker, 2004. page 99&lt;/ref&gt;

The Otto cycle is a description of what happens to a mass of gas as it is subjected to changes of pressure, temperature, volume, addition of heat, and removal of heat. The mass of gas that is subjected to those changes is called the system. The system, in this case, is defined to be the fluid (gas) within the cylinder. By describing the  changes that take place within the system, it will also describe in inverse, the system's effect on the environment. In the case of the Otto cycle, the effect will be  to produce enough net work from the system so as to propel an automobile and its occupants in the environment.

The Otto cycle is constructed from:
:Top and bottom of the loop: a pair of quasi-parallel and [[isentropic process]]es (frictionless, [[adiabatic]] reversible).
:Left and right sides of the loop: a pair of parallel [[isochoric process]]es (constant volume).

The isentropic process of compression or expansion implies that there will be no inefficiency (loss of mechanical energy), and there be no transfer of heat into or out of the system during that process. Hence the cylinder, and piston are assumed impermeable to heat during that time. Work is performed on the system during the lower isentropic compression process. Heat flows into the Otto cycle through the left pressurizing process and some of it flows back out through the right depressurizing process. The summation of the work added to the system plus the heat added minus the heat removed yields the net mechanical work generated by the system.

==Processes==
The processes are described by:&lt;ref name="Shapiro" /&gt;{{page needed|date=July 2017}}
*Process 0–1 a mass of air is drawn into piston/cylinder arrangement at constant pressure.
*Process 1–2 is an adiabatic (isentropic) compression of the charge as the piston moves from bottom [[Dead centre (engineering)|dead centre]] (''BDC'') to top dead centre (''TDC'').
*Process 2–3 is a constant-volume heat transfer to the working gas from an external source while the piston is at top dead centre. This process is intended to represent the ignition of the fuel-air mixture and the subsequent rapid burning.
*Process 3–4 is an adiabatic (isentropic) expansion (power stroke).
*Process 4–1 completes the cycle by a constant-volume process in which heat is rejected from the air while the piston is at bottom dead centre.
*Process 1–0 the mass of air is released to the atmosphere in a constant pressure process.

The Otto cycle consists of isentropic compression, heat addition at constant volume, isentropic expansion, and rejection of heat at constant volume. In the case of a four-stroke Otto cycle, technically there are two additional processes: one for the exhaust of [[waste heat]] and combustion products at constant pressure (isobaric), and one for the intake of cool oxygen-rich air also at constant pressure; however, these are often omitted in a simplified analysis.  Even though those two processes are critical to the functioning of a real engine, wherein the details of heat transfer and combustion chemistry are relevant, for the simplified analysis of the thermodynamic cycle, it is more convenient to assume that all of the waste-heat is removed during a single volume change.

==History==
The four-stroke engine was first patented by [[Alphonse Beau de Rochas]] in 1861.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Sport Aviation|title=150-Year-Old Technology|author=Mike Busch|page=26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before, in about 1854–57, two Italians ([[Eugenio Barsanti]] and [[Felice Matteucci]]) invented an engine that was rumored to be very similar, but the patent was lost.

The first person to build a working four-stroke engine, a stationary engine using a coal gas-air mixture for fuel (a [[gas engine]]), was [[Germany|German]] engineer [[Nikolaus Otto]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Development of Piston Aero Engines|last= Gunston |first= Bill |edition=2 |year=1999|publisher= Patrick Stephens Ltd|location= Sparkford, UK|isbn=978-0-7509-4478-6|page=21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This is why the four-stroke principle today is commonly known as the Otto cycle and four-stroke engines using [[spark plug]]s often are called Otto engines.

==Processes==
The system is defined to be the mass of air that is drawn from the atmosphere into the cylinder, compressed by the piston, heated by the spark ignition of the added fuel, allowed to expand as it pushes on the piston, and finally exhausted back into the atmosphere. The mass of air is followed as its volume, pressure and temperature change during the various thermodynamic steps. As the piston is capable of moving along the cylinder, the volume of the air changes with its position in the cylinder. The compression and expansion processes induced on the gas by the movement of the piston are idealised as reversible, i.e., no useful work is lost through turbulence or friction and no heat is transferred to or from the gas during those two processes. Energy is added to the air by the combustion of fuel. Useful work is extracted by the expansion of the gas in the cylinder. After the expansion is completed in the cylinder, the remaining heat is extracted and finally the gas is exhausted to the environment. Useful mechanical work is produced during the expansion process and some of that used to compress the air mass of the next cycle. The useful mechanical work produced minus that used for the compression process is the net work gained and that can be used for propulsion or for driving other machines. Alternatively the useful work gained is the difference between the heat added and the heat removed.

===Process 0–1 intake stroke (green arrow)===
A mass of air (working fluid) is drawn into the cylinder, from 0 to 1, at atmospheric pressure (constant pressure) through the open intake valve, while the exhaust valve is closed during this process. The intake valve closes at point 1.

===Process 1–2 compression stroke (''B'' on diagrams)===
Piston moves from crank end (BDC, bottom dead centre and maximum volume) to cylinder head end (''TDC'', top dead centre and minimum volume) as the working gas with initial state 1 is compressed isentropically to state point 2, through [[compression ratio]] {{math|(''V''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;/''V''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)}}. Mechanically this is the isentropic compression of the air/fuel mixture in the cylinder, also known as the compression stroke. This isentropic process assumes that no mechanical energy is lost due to friction and no heat is transferred to or from the gas, hence the process is reversible. The compression process requires that mechanical work be added to the working gas. Generally the compression ratio is around 9–10:1 {{math|(''V''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;:''V''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)}} for a typical engine.&lt;ref name="Electropaedia"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mpoweruk.com/heat_engines.htm |title=Heat Cycles - Electropeaedia |publisher=Woodbank Communications Ltd |date= |accessdate=2011-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Process 2–3 ignition phase (''C'' on diagrams)===
The piston is momentarily at rest at ''TDC''. During this instant, which is known as the ignition phase, the air/fuel mixture remains in a small volume at the top of the compression stroke. Heat is added to the working fluid by the combustion of the injected fuel, with the volume essentially being held constant. The pressure rises and the ratio &lt;math&gt;(P_3/P_2)&lt;/math&gt; is called the "explosion ratio".

===Process 3–4 expansion stroke (''D'' on diagrams)===
The increased high pressure exerts a force on the piston and pushes it towards the ''BDC''. Expansion of working fluid takes place isentropically and work is done by the system on the piston. The volume ratio &lt;math&gt;V_4/V_3&lt;/math&gt; is called the "isentropic expansion ratio". (For the Otto cycle is the same as the compression ratio &lt;math&gt;V_1/V_2&lt;/math&gt;). Mechanically this is the expansion of the hot gaseous mixture in the cylinder known as expansion (power) stroke.

===Process 4–1 idealized heat rejection (''A'' on diagrams)===
The piston is momentarily at rest at ''BDC''. The working gas pressure drops instantaneously  from point 4 to point 1 during a constant volume process as heat is removed to an idealized external sink that is brought into contact with the cylinder head. The gas has returned to state 1.

===Process 1–0 exhaust stroke===
The exhaust valve opens at point 1. As the piston moves from ''BDC'' (point 1) to ''TDC'' (point 0) with the exhaust valve opened, the gaseous mixture is vented to the atmosphere and the process starts anew.

==Cycle analysis==
In  the processes 1–2 the piston does work on the gas and in process 3–4 the gas does work on the piston during those isentropic compression and expansion processes, respectively. Processes 2–3 and 4–1 are isochoric processes; heat is transferred into the system from 2—3 and out of the system from 4—1 but no work is done on the system or extracted from the system during those processes. No work is done during an isochoric (constant volume) process because addition or removal of work from a system requires the movement of the boundaries of the system; hence, as the cylinder volume does not change, no shaft work is added to or removed from the system.

Four different equations are used to describe those four processes. A simplification is made by assuming changes of the kinetic and potential energy that take place in the system (mass of gas) can be neglected and then applying the first law of thermodynamics (energy conservation) to the mass of gas as it changes state as characterized by the gas's temperature, pressure, and volume.&lt;ref name="Shapiro"&gt;Moran, Michael J., and Howard N. Shapiro. ''Fundamentals of Engineering Thermodynamics''. 6th ed. Hoboken, N.J. : Chichester: Wiley ; John Wiley, 2008. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=July 2017}}&lt;ref name="Fundamentals"&gt;Gupta, H. N. ''Fundamentals of Internal Combustion''. New Delhi: Prentice-Hall, 2006. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=July 2017}}

During a complete cycle, the gas returns to its original state of temperature, pressure and volume, hence the net internal energy change of the system (gas) is zero. As a result, the energy (heat or work) added to the system must be offset by energy (heat or work) that leaves the system. In the analysis of thermodynamic systems, the convention is to account energy that enters the system as positive and energy that leaves the system is accounted as negative.

{{anchor |Equation 1a}}
Equation 1a.

During a complete cycle, the net change of energy of the system is zero:

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta E = E_\text{in} - E_\text{out} = 0&lt;/math&gt;

The above states that the system (the mass of gas) returns to the original thermodynamic state it was in at the start of the cycle.

Where &lt;math&gt;E_\text{in}&lt;/math&gt;is energy added to the system from 1–2–3 and &lt;math&gt;E_\text{out}&lt;/math&gt; is energy is removed from 3–4–1. In terms of work and heat added to the system

{{anchor |Equation 1b}}
Equation 1b:

:&lt;math&gt;W_{1-2} + Q_{2-3} + W_{3-4} + Q_{4-1} = 0&lt;/math&gt;

Each term of the equation can be expressed in terms of the internal energy of the gas at each point in the process:

:&lt;math&gt;W_{1-2} = U_2 - U_1&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;Q_{2-3} = U_3 - U_2&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;W_{3-4} = U_4 - U_3&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;Q_{4-1} = U_1 - U_4&lt;/math&gt;

The energy balance Equation 1b becomes

:&lt;math&gt;W_{1-2} + Q_{2-3} + W_{3-4} + Q_{4-1} = \left(U_2 - U_1\right) + \left(U_3 - U_2\right) + \left(U_4 - U_3\right) + \left(U_1 - U_4\right) = 0&lt;/math&gt;

To illustrate the example we choose some values to the points in the illustration:
:&lt;math&gt;U_1  = 1&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;U_2  = 5&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;U_3  = 9&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;U_4  = 4&lt;/math&gt;
These values are arbitrarily but rationally selected. The work and heat terms can then be calculated.

The energy added to the system as work during the compression from 1 to 2 is

:&lt;math&gt;\left(U_2 - U_1\right) = \left(5 - 1\right) = 4&lt;/math&gt;

The energy added to the system as heat from point 2 to 3 is

:&lt;math&gt;\left({U_3 - U_2}\right) = \left(9 - 5\right) = 4&lt;/math&gt;

The energy removed from the system as work during the expansion from 3 to 4 is

:&lt;math&gt;\left(U_4 - U_3\right) = \left(4 - 9\right) = -5&lt;/math&gt;

The energy removed from the system as heat from point 4 to 1 is

:&lt;math&gt;\left(U_1 - U_4\right) = \left(1 - 4\right) = -3&lt;/math&gt;

The energy balance is

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta E = + 4 + 4 - 5 - 3 = 0&lt;/math&gt;

Note that energy added to the system is counted as positive and energy leaving the system is counted as negative and the summation is zero as expected for a complete cycle that returns the system to its original state.

From the energy balance the work out of the system is:

:&lt;math&gt;\Sigma Work = W_{1-2} + W_{3-4} = \left(U_2 - U_1\right) + \left(U_4 - U_3\right) = 4 - 5 = -1&lt;/math&gt;

The net energy out of the system as work is -1, meaning the system has produced one net unit of energy that leaves the system in the form of work.

The net heat out of the system is:

:&lt;math&gt;\Sigma Heat = Q_{2-3} + Q_{4-1} = \left(U_3 - U_2\right) + \left(U_1 - U_4\right) = 4 -3 = 1&lt;/math&gt;

As energy added to the system as heat is positive. From the above it appears as if the system gained one unit of heat. This matches the energy produced by the system as work out of the system.

{{anchor |Thermal efficiency}}
Thermal efficiency is the quotient of the net work from the system, to the heat added to system.
Equation 2:

:&lt;math&gt;\eta = \frac{W_{1-2} + W_{3-4} }{Q_{2-3}} = \frac{\left(U_2 - U_1\right) + \left(U_4 - U_3\right)}{ \left(U_3 - U_2\right)}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\eta =1+\frac{U_1 - U_4 }{  \left(U_3 - U_2\right)} = 1+\frac{(1-4)}{ (9-5)} = 0.25  &lt;/math&gt;

Alternatively, thermal efficiency can be derived by strictly heat added and heat rejected.

:&lt;math&gt;\eta=\frac{Q_{2-3} + Q_{4-1}}{Q_{2-3}}
=1+\frac{\left(U_1-U_4\right) }{ \left(U_3-U_2\right)} &lt;/math&gt;

Supplying the fictitious values

&lt;math&gt;\eta=1+\frac{1-4}{9-5}=1+\frac{-3}{4}=0.25&lt;/math&gt;

In the Otto cycle, there is no heat transfer during the process 1–2 and 3–4 as they are isentropic processes. Heat is supplied only during the constant volume processes 2–3 and heat is rejected only during the constant volume processes 4–1.

{{anchor |The above values}}
The above values are absolute values that might, for instance, have units of joules (assuming the MKS system of units are to be used) and would be of use for a particular engine with particular dimensions. In the study of thermodynamic systems the extensive quantities such as energy, volume, or entropy (versus intensive quantities of temperature and pressure) are placed on a unit mass basis, and so too are the calculations, making those more general and therefore of more general use.  Hence, each term involving an extensive quantity could be divided by the mass, giving the terms units of joules/kg (specific energy), meters&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/kg (specific volume), or joules/(kelvin·kg) (specific entropy, heat capacity) etc. and would be represented using lower case letters, u, v, s, etc.

{{anchor |Equation 1}}
Equation 1 can now be related to the specific heat equation for constant volume. The [[Heat capacity|specific heats]] are particularly useful for thermodynamic calculations involving the [[ideal gas]] model.

:&lt;math&gt;C_\text{v} = \left(\frac{\delta u}{\delta T}\right)_\text{v}&lt;/math&gt;

Rearranging yields:

:&lt;math&gt;\delta u = (C_\text{v})(\delta T)&lt;/math&gt;

Inserting the specific heat equation into the thermal efficiency equation (Equation 2) yields.

:&lt;math&gt;\eta = 1-\left(\frac{C_\text{v}(T_4 - T_1)}{ C_\text{v}(T_3 - T_2)}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

Upon rearrangement:

:&lt;math&gt;\eta = 1-\left(\frac{T_1}{T_2}\right)\left(\frac{T_4/T_1-1}{T_3/T_2-1}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

Next, noting from the diagrams &lt;math&gt;T_4/T_1 = T_3/T_2&lt;/math&gt; (see [[Isentropic process|isentropic relations for an ideal gas]]), thus both of these can be omitted. The equation then reduces to:

{{anchor |Equation 2}}
Equation 2:
:&lt;math&gt;\eta = 1-\left(\frac{T_1}{T_2}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

Since the Otto cycle uses isentropic processes during the compression (process 1 to 2) and expansion (process 3 to 4) the [[Isentropic process|isentropic equations]] of ideal gases and the constant pressure/volume relations can be used to yield Equations 3 &amp; 4.&lt;ref name=Reynolds&gt;{{cite book|last=Reynolds &amp; Perkins|title=Engineering Thermodynamics|year=1977|publisher=McGraw-Hill|isbn=978-0-07-052046-2|pages=249}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{anchor |Equation 3}}
Equation 3:
:&lt;math&gt;\left(\frac{T_2}{T_1}\right)=\left(\frac{p_2}{p_1}\right)^{(\gamma-1)/{\gamma}}&lt;/math&gt;

{{anchor |Equation 4}}
Equation 4:
:&lt;math&gt;\left(\frac{T_2}{T_1}\right)=\left(\frac{V_1}{V_2}\right)^{(\gamma-1)}&lt;/math&gt;

::where

::&lt;math&gt;{\gamma} = \left(\frac{C_\text{p}}{C_\text{v}}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;{\gamma}&lt;/math&gt; is the specific heat ratio

::::The derivation of the previous equations are found by solving these four equations respectively (where &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is the [[specific gas constant]]):

::::&lt;math&gt;C_\text{p} \ln\left(\frac{V_1}{V_2}\right) - R \ln \left(\frac{p_2}{p_1}\right) = 0&lt;/math&gt;

::::&lt;math&gt;C_\text{v} \ln\left(\frac{T_2}{T_1}\right) - R \ln \left(\frac{V_2}{V_1}\right) = 0&lt;/math&gt;

::::&lt;math&gt;C_\text{p} = \left(\frac{\gamma R}{\gamma-1}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

::::&lt;math&gt;C_\text{v} = \left(\frac{R}{\gamma-1}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

Further simplifying Equation 4, where &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; is the compression ratio &lt;math&gt;(V_1/V_2)&lt;/math&gt;:

{{anchor |Equation 5}}
Equation 5:
:&lt;math&gt;\left(\frac{T_2}{T_1}\right) = \left(\frac{V_1}{V_2}\right)^{(\gamma-1)} = r^{(\gamma-1)}&lt;/math&gt;

From inverting Equation 4 and inserting it into Equation 2 the final thermal efficiency can be expressed as:{{page needed|date=July 2017}} name="Fundamentals" /&gt;{{page needed|date=July 2017}}

{{anchor |Equation 6}}
Equation 6:
:&lt;math&gt;\eta = 1 - \left(\frac{1}{r^{(\gamma-1)}}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

From analyzing equation 6 it is evident that the Otto cycle efficiency depends directly upon the compression ratio &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;. Since the &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; for air is 1.4, an increase in &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; will produce an increase in &lt;math&gt;\eta&lt;/math&gt;. However, the &lt;math&gt;\gamma &lt;/math&gt; for combustion products of the fuel/air mixture is often taken at approximately 1.3.
The foregoing discussion implies that it is more efficient to have a high compression ratio. The standard ratio is approximately 10:1 for typical automobiles. Usually this does not increase much because of the possibility of autoignition, or "[[Engine knocking|knock]]", which places an upper limit on the compression ratio.&lt;ref name="Shapiro" /&gt;{{page needed|date=July 2017}} During the compression process 1–2 the temperature rises, therefore an increase in the compression ratio causes an increase in temperature. Autoignition occurs when the temperature of the fuel/air mixture becomes too high before it is ignited by the flame front. The compression stroke is intended to compress the products before the flame ignites the mixture. If the compression ratio is increased, the mixture may auto-ignite before the compression stroke is complete, leading to "engine knocking". This can damage engine components and will decrease the brake horsepower of the engine.

== Power ==
The power produced by the Otto cycle is the energy developed per unit of time. The Otto engines are called four-stroke engines. 
The intake stroke and compression stroke require one rotation of the engine crankshaft. The power stroke and exhaust stroke require another rotation. For two rotations there is one work generating stroke.

From the above cycle analysis the net work produced by the system :

:&lt;math&gt;\Sigma \text{ Work} = W_{1-2} + W_{3-4} = \left(U_2 - U_1\right) + \left(U_4 - U_3\right) = +4 - 5 = -1&lt;/math&gt;

(again, using the sign convention, the minus sign implies energy is leaving the system as work)

If the units used were MKS the cycle would have produced one joule of energy in the form of work. For an engine of a particular displacement, such as one liter, the mass of gas of the system can be calculated assuming the engine is operating at standard temperature (20&amp;nbsp;°C) and pressure (1 atm). Using the Universal Gas Law the mass of one liter of gas is at room temperature and sea level pressure:

:&lt;math&gt;M=\frac{PV}{RT}&lt;/math&gt;

:''V''=0.001&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, ''R''=0.286&amp;nbsp;kJ/(kg·K), ''T''=293&amp;nbsp;K, ''P''=101.3&amp;nbsp;kN/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;

:''M''=0.00121&amp;nbsp;kg

At an engine speed of 3000 RPM there are 1500 work-strokes/minute or 25 work-strokes/second.

:&lt;math&gt;\Sigma \text{ Work} = 1\,\text{J}/(\text{kg}\cdot\text{stroke})\times 0.00121\,\text{kg}= 0.00121\,\text{J}/\text{stroke}&lt;/math&gt;

Power is 25 times that since there are 25 work-strokes/second

:&lt;math&gt;P = 25 \times 0.00121=0.0303\,\text{J}/\text{s}\; \text{or} \;\text{W}&lt;/math&gt;

If the engine is multi-cylinder, the result would be multiplied by that factor. If each cylinder is of a different liter displacement, the results would also be multiplied by that factor. These results are the product of the values of the internal energy that were assumed for the four states of the system at the end each of the four strokes (two rotations). They were selected only for the sake of illustration, and are obviously of low value. Substitution of actual values from an actual engine would produce results closer to that of the engine. Whose results would be higher than the actual engine as there are many simplifying assumptions made in the analysis that overlook inefficiencies. Such results would overestimate the power output.

== Increasing power and efficiency ==

The difference between the exhaust and intake pressures and temperatures means that some increase in efficiency can be gained by use of a turbocharger, removing from the exhaust flow some part of the remaining energy and transferring that to the intake flow to increase the intake pressure. A gas turbine can extract useful work energy from the exhaust stream and that can then be used to pressurize the intake air. The pressure and temperature of the exhausting gases would be reduced as they expand through the gas turbine and that work is then applied to the intake gas stream, increasing its pressure and temperature. The transfer of energy amounts to an efficiency improvement and the resulting power density of the engine is also improved. The intake air is typically cooled so as to reduce its volume as the work produced per stroke is a direct function of the amount of mass taken into the cylinder; denser air will produce more work per cycle. Practically speaking the intake air mass temperature must also be reduced to prevent premature ignition in a petrol fueled engine; hence, an [[intercooler]] is used to remove some energy as heat and so reduce the intake temperature. Such a scheme both increases the engine's efficiency and power.

The application of a supercharger driven by the crankshaft does increase the power output (power density) but does not increase efficiency as it uses some of the net work produced by the engine to pressurize the intake air and fails to extract otherwise wasted energy associated with the flow of exhaust at high temperature and a pressure to the ambient.

'''''Raketa mena''''' is a 2007 documentary film.

== Synopsis ==
On the coast of [[Androy]], the southernmost point of [[Madagascar]], the weather conditions don’t allow the fishermen to go fishing very often. The dunes build up, day by day, over fertile land. But that’s not the worst. The population is missing the most important element, water. To calm their thirst and hunger, many villages eat "raketa mena", a cactus whose scientific name is ''[[Opuntia stricta]]''. But this cactus is an invader that dries out the land. What is the solution?

A '''raygun''' is a [[science fiction]] [[particle-beam weapon]] that fires what is usually destructive energy.&lt;ref name="oxford"&gt;Jeff Prucher, ''Brave New Words: The Oxford Dictionary of Science Fiction,''  Oxford University Press, 2007, page 162&lt;/ref&gt; They have various alternate names: '''ray gun''', '''death ray''', '''beam gun''', '''blaster''', '''laser gun''', '''laser pistol''', '''phaser''', '''zap gun''', etc. In most stories, when activated, a raygun emits a ray, typically visible, usually lethal if it hits a human target, often destructive if it hits mechanical objects, with properties and other effects unspecified or varying.

Real-life analogues are [[Directed-energy weapon|directed-energy weapons]] or [[electrolaser]]s, electroshock weapons which send current along an electrically conductive laser-induced plasma channel.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

==History==
A very early example of a raygun is the [[Heat-Ray]] featured in [[H. G. Wells]]' novel ''[[The War of the Worlds (novel)|The War of the Worlds]]'' (1898).&lt;ref name="Van Riper 46"&gt;Van Riper, op.cit., p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt; Science fiction during the 1920s described death rays. Early science fiction often described or depicted raygun beams making bright light and loud noise like [[lightning]] or large [[electric arc]]s.

According to ''[[The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Peter Nicholls, John Clute, and David Langford, "[http://www.sf-encyclopedia.com/entry/ray_gun Ray Gun],"  ''The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction,'' 3rd edition, Jan 15, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; the word "ray gun" was first used by [[Victor Rousseau Emanuel|Victor Rousseau]] in 1917, in a passage from ''The Messiah of the Cylinder'':&lt;ref&gt;[[Victor Rousseau Emanuel|Victor Rousseau]] , "The Messiah of the Cylinder",  serialized in ''Everybody's Magazine,'' June–September 1917 ( [http://www.isfdb.org/cgi-bin/title.cgi?899494 ISFDB link]).&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;All is not going well, Arnold: the ray-rods are emptying fast, and our attack upon the lower level of the wing has failed. Sanson has placed a ray-gun there. All depends on the air-scouts, and we must hold our positions until the battle-planes arrive.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The variant "ray projector" was used by [[John W. Campbell]] in ''[[The Black Star Passes]]'' in 1930.&lt;ref name="oxford" /&gt;  Related terms "disintegrator ray" dates to 1898 in [[Garrett P. Serviss]]' ''[[Edison's Conquest of Mars]]''; "blaster" dates to 1925 in [[Nictzin Dyalhis]]' story "When the Green Star Waned;" and "needle ray" and "needler" date to 1934 in [[E.E. Smith]]'s ''[[The Skylark of Valeron]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Winchell Chung, [http://www.projectrho.com/public_html/rocket/sidearmintro.php "Introduction to Sidearms"], ''Project Rho: Atomic Rockets'' (accessed 3 March 2016)&lt;/ref&gt;

Ray guns were so common on magazine covers during the [[Golden Age of Science Fiction]] that Campbell's ''[[Astounding Science Fiction|Astounding]]'' was unusual for not depicting them.&lt;ref name="pontin20081020"&gt;{{Cite magazine |last=Pontin |first=Mark Williams |date=November-December 2008 |title=The Alien Novelist |url=https://www.technologyreview.com/s/411039/the-alien-novelist/ |magazine=MIT Technology Review |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term "ray gun" had already become cliché by the 1940s,&lt;ref name="TV_tropes"&gt;[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RayGun "Ray Gun"], ''TV Tropes'' (accessed 3 March 2016)&lt;/ref&gt; in part due to association with the comic strips (and later [[serial film|film serials]]) [[Buck Rogers]] and [[Flash Gordon]].
Soon after the invention of [[laser]]s during 1960, such devices became briefly fashionable as a directed-energy weapon for science fiction stories. For instance, characters of the ''[[Lost in Space]]'' TV series (1965–1968) and of the ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series|Star Trek]]'' [[pilot episode]] "[[The Cage (Star Trek: The Original Series)|The Cage]]" (1964) carried handheld laser weapons.&lt;ref name="Van Riper 45"&gt;{{cite book|last=Van Riper|first=A. Bowdoin|title=Science in popular culture: a reference guide|publisher=[[Greenwood Press]]|location=Westport|year=2002|page=45|isbn=0-313-31822-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the late 1960s and 1970s, as the laser's limits as a weapon became evident, rayguns were dubbed "[[phaser (fictional weapon)|phasers]]" (for ''[[Star Trek]]''), "[[Blaster (Star Wars)|blasters]]" (''[[Star Wars]]''), "pulse rifles", "[[plasma rifle]]s", and so forth.

In his book ''Physics of the Impossible'', [[Michio Kaku]] used [[gamma ray burst]]s as an evidence to illustrate that extremely powerful rayguns such as the [[Death Star]]'s primary weapon in the ''Star Wars'' franchise do not violate known physical laws and theories.  He further analyses the problem of rayguns' power sources.

==Function==
Ray guns as described by [[science fiction]] do not have the disadvantages that have, so far, made [[directed-energy weapon]]s largely impractical as weapons in real life, needing a [[suspension of disbelief]] by a technologically educated audience:
*Ray guns draw seemingly limitless power from often unspecified sources. In contrast to their real-world counterparts, the batteries or power packs of even handheld weapons are minute, durable, and do not seem to need frequent recharging.
*Ray guns in movies are often shown as shooting discrete pulses of energy visible from off-axis, traveling slowly enough for people to see them emerge, or even for the target to evade them,&lt;ref name="Van Riper 46" /&gt; although real-life [[laser light]] is invisible from off-axis and travels at the [[speed of light]]. This effect could sometimes be attributed to the beam heating atmosphere that it was passing through.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}} A possible evasion tactic is dodging the firing axis of the gun, theorized in the early story of ''[[Mobile Suit Gundam]]'' by the character [[Char Aznable]] when he first encountered the series protagonist's machine's beam rifle and seemingly dodging it without any difficulty.

Some of the effects are what would be expected from a powerful directed-energy beam if it could be generated in reality:
*Ray guns are often shown as transmitting [[heat]], as with Wells' [[heat-Ray|heat rays]].&lt;ref name="Van Riper 46" /&gt;
*Ray guns may be used to cut through hard materials like a [[blowtorch]].&lt;ref name="Van Riper 46" /&gt;

But sometimes not:
*In movies, rays are often depicted as having effect instantaneously, with a touch of the beam sufficing for the intended purpose.&lt;ref name="Van Riper 46" /&gt; Raygun victims are generally killed instantaneously, often – as in the ''Star Wars'' films – without showing visible wounds or even holes in their clothing.&lt;ref name="Van Riper 46" /&gt;
*Some rayguns cause their targets to disappear ("de-materialize", disintegrate, vaporize or evaporate) entirely, personal equipment and all.
*Visible barrel [[recoil]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}} This would only happen if the [[momentum]] of the beam were comparable to that of a bullet shot from a gun.
*A wide range of non-lethal functions as determined by the requirements of the story: for instance, they may stun, paralyze or knock down a target, much like modern [[electroshock weapon]]s.&lt;ref name="Van Riper 46" /&gt; Occasionally the rays may have other effects, such as the "freeze rays" in the TV series ''[[Batman (TV series)|Batman]]'' (1966–1968) and ''[[Underdog (TV series)|Underdog]]'' (1964–1970).&lt;ref name="Van Riper 46" /&gt; Many of the more implausible functions are almost farcical and include rayguns that age or de-age people (various cartoons); shrink rays (''[[Fantastic Voyage]]'', ''[[Honey, I Shrunk the Kids]])'', and a "dehydration ray" (''[[Megamind]]'').

Ultimately, rayguns have whatever properties are required for their dramatic purpose. They bear little resemblance to real-world directed-energy weapons, even if they are given the names of existing technologies such as lasers, [[maser]]s, or [[particle beam]]s.&lt;ref name="Van Riper 46" /&gt; This can be compared with real-type [[firearm]]s as commonly depicted by [[action movie]]s, as tending infallibly to hit whatever they are aimed at (when wielded by the heroes) and seldom depleting their ammunition.&lt;ref name="Van Riper 47"&gt;Van Riper, op.cit., p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt;

Rayguns by their various names have various sizes and forms: [[pistol]]-like; two-handed (often called a [[rifle]]); mounted on a vehicle; [[artillery]]-sized mounted on a [[spacecraft|spaceship]] or space base or [[asteroid]] or [[planet]].

Rayguns have a great variety of shapes and sizes, according to the imagination of the story writers or movie [[Theatrical property|prop]] makers. Most pistol rayguns have a conventional [[pistol grip|grip]] and [[trigger (firearms)|trigger]],{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}} but some (e.g. ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'' [[Weapons of Star Trek#Phasers|phasers]]) do not. Sometimes the end of the barrel expands into a shield, as if to protect the user from back-flash from the emitted beam.

==Types==
{{Cleanup|section|date=August 2009}}
&lt;!-- I've trivially merged two separate types sections (edit date: 2009-08-18)  I've not made any attempt at this time to clean up / properly merge the content --&gt;

The ray is usually stated to be one of the following:
* [[Laser]]
* A real type of [[particle beam]], e.g. [[proton]]s and/or [[neutron]]s from the [[proton pack]]s in ''[[Ghostbusters]]''
* A fictional type of particle beam, such as:
**"Minovsky particles" in the ''[[Universal Century]] [[Gundam]]'' series scenario, where [[Universal Century Technology#Minovsky physics|Minovsky Physics]] always operate; in the ''[[Mobile Suit Gundam 00]]'' series, they use "GN particles" (a byproduct of a fictional topological defect [[baryon]] decay); and other timelines use other unknown particles.
** [[Nadion]]s, in the well-known ''[[Star Trek]]'' [[List of weapons in Star Trek#Energy weapons|phaser]]
** "Greek letter" rays other than the well known real-world [[alpha ray]], [[beta ray]], [[gamma ray]]. This includes [[delta ray]]s and [[epsilon ray]]s, which however have been given real-world meanings.
* [[Plasma (physics)|Plasma]]; see also [[plasma rifle]]
* Defined by a word not known in real-world science, e.g. "[[Weapons of Star Trek#Disruptors|disruptor]]".
*Stunner: non-lethal and only disable an opponent temporarily by knocking them out. They are often seen in television cartoons where realistic effects of real-world weapons would be disallowed due to restrictions of violence.&lt;ref name="TV_tropes" /&gt;
* See [[Blaster (Star Wars)#In-universe_technology]] for an attempt (using unreal technology) at describing how a type of raygun works.
* Undefined

Rayguns are often one-handed, sometimes two-handed, and often artillery-sized fastened to a [[spacecraft|spaceship]].

Rayguns powered by a backpack powerpack are described from time to time in science fiction.

Sunlight is absorbed by a special material at the center of each tube that has a selective surface. The surface absorbs sunlight nearly completely, and emits very little of the solar heat as thermal radiation. Ordinary black surfaces are also efficient absorbers, but they emit thermal radiation copiously.]]
{{unreferenced|date=July 2014}}
In [[solar thermal collector]]s, a '''selective surface''' or '''selective [[Absorption_(electromagnetic_radiation)|absorber]]''' is a means of increasing its operation temperature and/or efficiency. The selectivity is defined as the [[ratio]] of [[solar radiation]] [[absorption (electromagnetic radiation)|absorption]] (α&lt;sub&gt;sol&lt;/sub&gt;) to [[thermal infrared radiation]] [[emission (electromagnetic radiation)|emission]] (ε&lt;sub&gt;therm&lt;/sub&gt;).

&lt;!-- Materials that exhibit this combination of characteristics do not, however, exist in nature. --&gt;Selective surfaces take advantage of the differing wavelengths of incident solar radiation and the emissive radiation from the absorbing surface:
* Solar radiation covers approximately the wavelengths 350&amp;nbsp;nm to 4000&amp;nbsp;nm; [[UV-A]], [[Visible light|visible]] and [[near infrared]]&amp;nbsp;([[Near infrared|NIR]], or [[IR-A]] plus [[IR-B]]).
* Thermal [[infrared radiation]], from materials with temperatures approximately in the interval -40 to 100 °C, covers approximately the wavelengths 4000&amp;nbsp;nm to 40,000&amp;nbsp;nm =&amp;nbsp;4&amp;nbsp;um to 40&amp;nbsp;um; The thermal infrared radiation interval being named or covered by: [[Mid-infrared|MIR]], [[LWIR]] or [[IR-C]].

== Materials ==
Normally, a combination of materials is used.  One of the first selective surfaces investigated was a semiconductor-metal tandem&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy02osti/31267.pdf|title=Review of Mid- to High-Temperature Solar Selective Absorber Materials|last=Kennedy|first=Cheryl|date=2002|website=NREL|accessdate=21 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; – simply [[copper]] with a layer of black [[cupric oxide]]. Silicon on metal is also another example.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; A different design has ceramic–metal composites (cermets) on metal substrates.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tesfamichael|first=Tuquabo|last2=Wäckelgård|first2=Ewa|date=1999-07-01|title=Angular solar absorptance of absorbers used in solar thermal collectors|url=https://www.osapublishing.org/abstract.cfm?uri=ao-38-19-4189|journal=Applied Optics|language=EN|volume=38|issue=19|pages=4189–4197|doi=10.1364/AO.38.004189|issn=2155-3165|bibcode=1999ApOpt..38.4189T}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Black]] [[chromium]] ("black chrome") and [[nickel]]-plated anodized aluminum is another selective surface that is very durable, highly resistant to [[humidity]] or [[oxidizing]] atmospheres and extreme [[temperature]]s, while being able to retain its selective properties, but expensive. One of the more popular designs – a multi-layer broadband solar absorber – consists of a metal substrate coated with multiple layers of metal and dielectric materials. While those have to be vacuum-deposited, they have been widely adopted due to their suitability for vacuum tubes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.almecogroup.com/en/pagina/53-tinox-energy-cu|title=TiNOX energy|last=|first=|date=2018|website=Alemco|accessdate=21 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Although ordinary black paint has high solar absorption, it also has high thermal emissivity, and thus it is not a selective surface.

Typical values for a selective surface might be 0.90 solar absorption and 0.10 thermal emissivity, but can range from 0.8/0.3 for paints on metal to 0.96/0.05 for commercial surfaces. Thermal emissivities as low as 0.02 have been obtained in laboratories.

== Other applications ==
Selective surfaces are used for other applications than solar thermal collectors, such as [[low emissivity]] surfaces used in [[Window#Glazing_and_filling|window]] glasses, which reflect thermal radiation and have high [[transmittance]] factors (being [[Transparency and translucency|transparent]]) for [[visible light|visible sunlight]].

{{Thermoelectric effect|cTopic=Applications}}
'''Thermoelectric materials''' show the [[thermoelectric effect]] in a strong or convenient form.

The ''thermoelectric effect'' refers to phenomena by which either a [[temperature]] difference creates an [[electric potential]] or an electric potential creates a temperature difference. These phenomena are known more specifically as the [[Seebeck effect]] (converting temperature to current), [[Peltier effect]] (converting current to temperature), and [[Thomson effect]] (conductor heating/cooling). While all materials have a nonzero thermoelectric effect, in most materials it is too small to be useful. However, low-cost materials that have a sufficiently strong thermoelectric effect (and other required properties) could be used in applications including [[thermogenerator|power generation]] and [[refrigeration]]. A commonly used thermoelectric material in such applications is [[bismuth telluride]] ({{chem|Bi|2|Te|3}}).

Thermoelectric materials are used in thermoelectric systems for [[#Refrigeration|cooling or heating in niche applications]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=gLdLCAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT176&amp;lpg=PT176#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Saving Energy and Reducing CO2 Emissions with Electricity], Clark W.

==Materials selection criteria==

The usefulness of a material in thermoelectric systems is determined by the two factors [[#device efficiency|device efficiency]] and [[#power factor|power factor]]. These are determined by the material's [[electrical conductivity]], [[thermal conductivity]], [[Seebeck coefficient]] and behavior under changing [[temperature]]s.

===Device efficiency===
The efficiency of a thermoelectric device for electricity generation is given by &lt;math&gt;\eta&lt;/math&gt;, defined as
:&lt;math&gt;\eta = {\text{energy provided  to  the  load} \over \text{heat  energy  absorbed  at  hot  junction}}.&lt;/math&gt;
The ability of a given material to efficiently produce thermoelectric power is related to its dimensionless [[figure of merit]] given by&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Khatami|first=S. N.|date=2016|title=Lattice Thermal Conductivity of the Binary and Ternary Group-IV Alloys Si-Sn, Ge-Sn, and Si-Ge-Sn|journal=Physical Review Applied|volume=6|issue=1|pages=014015|doi=10.1103/physrevapplied.6.014015|bibcode=2016PhRvP...6a4015K}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;ZT = {\sigma S^2 T \over \kappa}&lt;/math&gt;,
which depends on the [[Seebeck coefficient]] ''S'', [[thermal conductivity]] ''κ'', [[electrical conductivity]] ''σ'', and temperature ''T''.

In an actual thermoelectric device, two materials are used. The maximum efficiency &lt;math&gt;\eta_\mathrm{max}&lt;/math&gt; is then given by
:&lt;math&gt;\eta_\mathrm{max} = {T_H - T_C \over T_H} {\sqrt{1+Z\bar{T}}-1 \over \sqrt{1+Z\bar{T}} + {T_C \over T_H}},&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;T_H&lt;/math&gt; is the temperature at the hot junction and &lt;math&gt;T_C&lt;/math&gt; is the temperature at the surface being cooled. &lt;math&gt;Z\bar{T}&lt;/math&gt; is the modified dimensionless figure of merit, which takes into consideration the thermoelectric capacity of both thermoelectric materials being used in the device and, after geometrical optimization regarding the legs sections,&lt;ref&gt;A.F. Ioffe, Physics of semiconductors, Academic Press Inc., New York (1960)&lt;/ref&gt; is defined as
:&lt;math&gt;Z\bar{T} = {(S_p - S_n)^2 \bar{T} \over [(\rho_n \kappa_n)^{1/2} + (\rho_p \kappa_p)^{1/2}]^2} &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; is the electrical resistivity, &lt;math&gt;\bar{T}&lt;/math&gt; is the average temperature between the hot and cold surfaces and the subscripts n and p denote properties related to the n- and p-type semiconducting thermoelectric materials, respectively. Since thermoelectric devices are heat engines, their efficiency is limited by the [[Carnot efficiency]], hence the &lt;math&gt;T_H&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;T_C&lt;/math&gt; terms in &lt;math&gt;\eta_\mathrm{max}&lt;/math&gt;. Regardless, the [[coefficient of performance]] of current commercial thermoelectric refrigerators ranges from 0.3 to 0.6, one-sixth the value of traditional vapor-compression refrigerators.&lt;ref&gt;Solar refrigeration options – a state-of-the-art review. D.S. Kim, C.A. Infante Ferreira. 2008, International Journal of Refrigeration, pp. 3–15. [https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijrefrig.2007.07.011 DOI web link]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Power factor===
To determine the usefulness of a material in a [[thermoelectric generator]] or a [[thermoelectric cooler]] the '''power factor''' is calculated by its [[Seebeck coefficient]] and its electrical conductivity under a given temperature difference:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Power~factor} = \sigma S^2.&lt;/math&gt;
where ''S'' is the [[Seebeck coefficient]], and ''σ'' is the [[electrical conductivity]].

Materials with a high power factor are able to 'generate' more energy (move more heat or extract more energy from that temperature difference) in a space-constrained application, but are not necessarily more efficient in generating this energy.

===Aspects of materials choice===
For good efficiency, materials with high electrical conductivity, low thermal conductivity and high Seebeck coefficient are needed.

====State density: metals vs semiconductors ====
The band structure of semiconductors offers better thermoelectric effects than the band structure of metals.

The [[Fermi energy]] is below the [[conduction band]] causing the state density to be asymmetric around the Fermi energy. Therefore, the average electron energy of the conduction band is higher than the Fermi energy, making the system conducive for charge motion into a lower energy state. By contrast, the Fermi energy lies in the conduction band in metals. This makes the state density symmetric about the Fermi energy so that the average conduction electron energy is close to the Fermi energy, reducing the forces pushing for charge transport. Therefore, semiconductors are ideal thermoelectric materials.&lt;ref name="Purdue lecture"&gt;Timothy D. Sands (2005), [http://nanohub.org/resources/383 Designing Nanocomposite Thermoelectric Materials]&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the small Seebeck coefficient metals have a very limited performance and the main materials of interest are [[Semiconductor]]s.

====Conductivity ====
In the efficiency equations above, [[thermal conductivity]] and [[electrical conductivity]] compete.

The thermal conductivity ''κ'' has mainly two components: 
:''κ'' = ''κ'' &lt;sub&gt;electron&lt;/sub&gt; + ''κ'' &lt;sub&gt;phonon&lt;/sub&gt;
According to the [[Wiedemann–Franz law]], the higher the electrical conductivity, the higher ''κ'' &lt;sub&gt;electron&lt;/sub&gt; becomes.&lt;ref name="Purdue lecture" /&gt; Thus in metals the ratio of thermal to electrical conductivity is about fixed, as the electron part dominates.
In semiconductors, the phonon part is important and can not be neglected. It reduces the efficiency. For good efficiency a low ratio of ''κ'' &lt;sub&gt;phonon&lt;/sub&gt; / ''κ'' &lt;sub&gt;electron&lt;/sub&gt; is desired.

Therefore, it is necessary to minimize ''κ'' &lt;sub&gt;phonon&lt;/sub&gt; and keep the electrical conductivity high. Thus semiconductors should be highly doped.

G. A. Slack&lt;ref&gt;Slack GA., in {{harvnb|Rowe|2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; proposed that in order to optimize the figure of merit, [[phonons]], which are responsible for thermal conductivity must experience the material as a glass (experiencing a high degree of [[phonon]] scattering—lowering [[thermal conductivity]]) while [[electrons]] must experience it as a [[crystal]] (experiencing very little scattering—maintaining [[electrical conductivity]]). The figure of merit can be improved through the independent adjustment of these properties.

==== Quality Factor (detailed theory on semiconductors) ====
The maximum &lt;math&gt;Z\bar{T}&lt;/math&gt; of a material is given by the material's Quality Factor:

&lt;math&gt;B= \frac{2 k_B^2 \hbar}{3 \pi} \frac{N_vC_l}{m_l^*\Xi^2\kappa_L} T&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;k_B&lt;/math&gt; is the Boltzmann constant, &lt;math&gt;\hbar&lt;/math&gt; is the reduced Planck constant, &lt;math&gt;N_v&lt;/math&gt; is the number of degenerated valleys for the band, &lt;math&gt;C_l&lt;/math&gt; is the average longitudinal elastic moduli, &lt;math&gt;m_l^*&lt;/math&gt; is the inertial effective mass,  &lt;math&gt;\Xi&lt;/math&gt; is the deformation potential coefficient, &lt;math&gt;\kappa_L&lt;/math&gt; is the lattice thermal conduction, and &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is temperature. The figure of merit, &lt;math&gt;Z\bar{T}&lt;/math&gt;, depends on doping concentration and temperature of the material of interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Good Thermoelectrics|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0081194708601903|publisher = Academic Press|date = 1997-01-01|pages = 81–157|volume = 51|first = G.

A large density of states can be created due to a large number of conducting bands (&lt;math&gt;N_v&lt;/math&gt;) or by flat bands giving a high band effective mass (&lt;math&gt;m_b^*&lt;/math&gt;). For isotropic materials &lt;math&gt;m_b^*= m_l^*&lt;/math&gt;. Therefore, it is desirable for thermoelectric materials to have high valley degeneracy in a very sharp band structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Band Engineering of Thermoelectric Materials|url = http://authors.library.caltech.edu/36138/|website = authors.library.caltech.edu|date = 2012-12-04|accessdate = 2015-10-23|first = Pei,|last = Yanzhong|first2 = Wang,|last2 = Heng|first3 = Snyder, G.|last3 = J.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other complex features of the electronic structure are important. These can be partially quantified using an electronic fitness function.&lt;ref&gt;Xing et al. Phys. Rev. Mater. 1,  065405 (2017), https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevMaterials.1.065405&lt;/ref&gt;

==Materials of interest==
Strategies to improve thermoelectrics include both advanced [[bulk material]]s and the use of low-dimensional systems. Such approaches to reduce [[Crystal structure|lattice]] [[thermal conductivity]] fall under three general material types: (1) [[Alloy]]s: create point defects, vacancies, or rattling structures ([[heavy-ion]] species with large vibrational [[amplitude]]s contained within partially filled structural sites) to scatter phonons within the [[unit cell]] crystal;&lt;ref&gt;Bhandari, C. M. in {{harvnb|Rowe|2005|pp=55–65}}&lt;/ref&gt; (2) Complex [[crystal]]s: separate the phonon glass from the electron crystal using approaches similar to those for [[superconductor]]s (the region responsible for electron transport should be an electron crystal of a high-mobility semiconductor, while the phonon glass should ideally house disordered structures and [[dopant]]s without disrupting the electron crystal, analogous to the charge reservoir in high-T&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; superconductors&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Cava, R.

Materials under consideration for thermoelectric device applications include:

===Bismuth chalcogenides and their nanostructures===
Materials such as [[Bismuth telluride|{{chem|Bi|2|Te|3}}]] and {{chem|Bi|2|Se|3}} comprise some of the best performing room temperature thermoelectrics with a temperature-independent figure-of-merit, ZT, between 0.8 and 1.0.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=XVI ICT '97.

The result is an enhanced ZT (approximately 2.4 at room temperature for p-type).&lt;ref name=vsco&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1038/35098012|year=2001|last1=Venkatasubramanian|first1=Rama|last2=Siivola|first2=Edward|last3=Colpitts|first3=Thomas|last4=O'Quinn|first4=Brooks|journal=Nature|volume=413|issue=6856|pages=597–602|pmid=11595940|title=Thin-film thermoelectric devices with high room-temperature figures of merit|bibcode = 2001Natur.413..597V }}&lt;/ref&gt; Note that this high value of ZT has not been independently confirmed due to the complicated demands on the growth of such superlattices and device fabrication; however the material ZT values are consistent with the performance of hot-spot coolers made out of these materials and validated at Intel Labs.

Bismuth telluride and its solid solutions are good thermoelectric materials at room temperature and therefore suitable for refrigeration applications around 300 K. The Czochralski method has been used to grow single crystalline bismuth telluride compounds. These compounds are usually obtained with directional solidification from melt or powder metallurgy processes. Materials produced with these methods have lower efficiency than single crystalline ones due to the random orientation of crystal grains, but their mechanical properties are superior and the sensitivity to structural defects and impurities is lower due to high optimal carrier concentration.

The required carrier concentration is obtained by choosing a nonstoichiometric composition, which is achieved by introducing excess bismuth or tellurium atoms to primary melt or by dopant impurities. Some possible dopants are [[halogen]]s and group IV and V atoms. Due to the small bandgap (0.16 eV) Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Te&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; is partially degenerate and the corresponding Fermi-level should be close to the conduction band minimum at room temperature. The size of the band-gap means that Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Te&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; has high intrinsic carrier concentration. Therefore, minority carrier conduction cannot be neglected for small stoichiometric deviations. Use of telluride compounds is limited by the toxicity and rarity of tellurium.{{sfn|Rowe|2005|loc=Chapter 27}}

===Lead telluride===

In 2008 Joseph Heremans and his colleagues demonstrated that [[thallium]]-doped [[lead]] telluride alloy (PbTe) achieves a ZT of 1.5 at 773 K.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1126/science.1159725|title=Enhancement of Thermoelectric Efficiency in PbTe by Distortion of the Electronic Density of States|year=2008|last1=Heremans|first1=J.

They also claim that [[selenium]] increases electric conductivity and reduces thermal conductivity.

In 2012 another team used lead telluride to convert 15 to 20 percent of waste heat to electricity, reaching a ZT of 2.2, which they claimed was the highest yet reported.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.gizmag.com/most-efficient-thermoelectric-material/24210/|title = World’s most efficient thermoelectric material developed|last = Quick|first = Darren|date = September 20, 2012|work = Gizmag|accessdate = 16 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1038/nature11439| title = High-performance bulk thermoelectrics with all-scale hierarchical architectures| journal = Nature| volume = 489| issue = 7416| pages = 414–418| year = 2012| last1 = Biswas | first1 = K. | last2 = He | first2 = J. | last3 = Blum | first3 = I.

===Inorganic clathrates===

Inorganic [[clathrate]]s have the general formula A&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;B&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;46-y&lt;/sub&gt; (type I) and A&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;B&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;136-y&lt;/sub&gt; (type II), where B and C are group III and IV elements, respectively, which form the framework where “guest” A atoms ([[alkali metal|alkali]] or [[alkaline earth metal]]) are encapsulated in two different [[polyhedra]] facing each other. The differences between types I and II come from the number and size of voids present in their [[unit cell]]s. Transport properties depend on the framework's properties, but tuning is possible by changing the “guest” atoms.{{sfn|Rowe|2005|loc=32–33}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Gatti, C., Bertini, L., Blake, N. P. and Iversen, B. B. |title=Guest–Framework Interaction in Type I Inorganic Clathrates with Promising Thermoelectric Properties: On the Ionic versus Neutral Nature of the Alkaline-Earth Metal Guest A in A&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;Ga&lt;sub&gt;16&lt;/sub&gt;Ge&lt;sub&gt;30&lt;/sub&gt; (A=Sr, Ba)|doi= 10.1002/chem.200304837|pmid=14502642|volume=9|issue=18|date=September 2003|journal=Chemistry|pages=4556–68}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most direct approach to synthesize and optimize the thermoelectric properties of semiconducting type I clathrates is substitutional doping, where some framework atoms are replaced with dopant atoms. In addition, powder metallurgical and crystal growth techniques have been used in clathrate synthesis. The structural and chemical properties of clathrates enable the optimization of their transport properties as a function of [[stoichiometry]]. The structure of type II materials allows a partial filling of the polyhedra, enabling better tuning of the electrical properties and therefore better control of the doping level. Partially filled variants can be synthesized as semiconducting or even insulating.

Blake ''et al.'' have predicted ZT~0.5 at room temperature and ZT~1.7 at 800 K for optimized compositions. Kuznetsov ''et al.'' measured electrical resistance and Seebeck coefficient for three different type I clathrates above room temperature and by estimating high temperature thermal conductivity from the published low temperature data they obtained ZT~0.7 at 700 K for Ba&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;Ga&lt;sub&gt;16&lt;/sub&gt;Ge&lt;sub&gt;30&lt;/sub&gt; and ZT~0.87 at 870 K for Ba&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;Ga&lt;sub&gt;16&lt;/sub&gt;Si&lt;sub&gt;30&lt;/sub&gt;.{{sfn|Rowe|2005|loc=Chapter 32-33}}

===Magnesium group IV compounds===

Mg&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;B&lt;sup&gt;IV&lt;/sup&gt; (B&lt;sup&gt;IV&lt;/sup&gt;=Si, Ge, Sn) compounds and their solid solutions are good thermoelectric materials and their ZT values are comparable with those of established materials. The appropriate production methods are based on direct co-melting, but mechanical alloying has also been used. During synthesis, magnesium losses due to evaporation and segregation of components (especially for Mg&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Sn) need to be taken into account. Directed crystallization methods can produce single crystalline material. Solid solutions and doped compounds have to be annealed in order to produce homogeneous samples - with the same properties throughout. At 800 K, Mg&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Si&lt;sub&gt;0.55−x&lt;/sub&gt;Sn&lt;sub&gt;0.4&lt;/sub&gt;Ge&lt;sub&gt;0.05&lt;/sub&gt;Bi&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; has been reported to have a figure of merit about 1.4, the highest ever reported for these compounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.scriptamat.2013.07.008|title=High thermoelectric figure of merit of Mg2Si0.55-xSn0.4Ge0.05 materials doped with Bi and Sb|year=2013|last1=Khan|first1=A.U.|last2=Vlachos|first2=N|last3=Kyratsi|first3=Th|journal=Scripta Materialia|volume=69|issue=8|pages=606–609 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Silicides===

Higher silicides display ZT levels with current materials. They are mechanically and chemically strong and therefore can often be used in harsh environments without protection. Possible fabrication methods include [[Czochralski process|Czochralski]] and floating zone for single crystals and hot pressing and [[sintering]] for polycrystalline.{{sfn|Rowe|2005|loc=Chapter 31}}

===Skutterudite thermoelectrics===
Recently, [[skutterudite]] materials have sparked the interest of researchers in search of new thermoelectrics.&lt;ref&gt;Caillat, T., Borshchevsky, A., and Fleurial, J.-P., In Proceedings of 7th International Conference TEs, K. Rao, ed., pp. 98 – 101. University of Texas, Arlington, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; These structures are of the form {{chem|(Co,Ni,Fe)(P,Sb,As)|3}} and are cubic with [[space group]] Im3. Unfilled, these materials contain voids into which low-coordination ions (usually [[rare-earth elements]]) can be inserted in order to alter thermal conductivity by producing sources for lattice phonon scattering and decrease thermal conductivity due to the lattice without reducing electrical conductivity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1063/1.361828|title=The effect of rare-earth filling on the lattice thermal conductivity of skutterudites|year=1996|last1=Nolas|first1=G.

However, recently Khan et al. showed that it is possible to reduce the thermal conductivity without filling these voids and enhance the figure of merit by 100%, with special architecture containing nano and micro pores.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.nanoen.2016.11.016|title=Nano-micro-porous skutterudites with 100% enhancement in ZT for high performance thermoelectricity|year=2017|last1=Khan|first1=Atta U.|last2=Kobayashi|first2=Kazuaki|last3=Tang|first3=Dai-Ming|last4=Yamauchi|first4=Yasuke|last5=Hasegawa|first5=Kotone|last6=Mitome|first6=Masanori|last7=Xue|first7=Yanming|last8=Jiang|first8=Baozhen|last9=Tsuchiay|first9=Koichi|last10=Dmitri|first10=Golberg|last11=Mori|first11=Takao|journal=Nano Energy|volume=31|pages=152–159 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Skutterudites have the chemical formula LM&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;X&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;, where L is a [[rare-earth metal]], M a [[transition metal]] and X a [[metalloid]], a group V element or [[pnictogen]] whose properties lie between those of a metal and nonmetal such as [[phosphorus]], [[antimony]], or [[arsenic]]. These materials could be potential in multistage thermoelectric devices as it has been shown that they have ZT&gt;1.0, but their properties are not well known.{{sfn|Rowe|2005|loc=Chapter 34}}

Interest in oxides as thermoelectric materials was reawakened in 1997 when Na&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;CoO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; was found to exhibit good thermoelectric behavior. In addition to their thermal stability, other advantages of oxides are their non-toxicity and high oxidation resistance.

===Half Heusler alloys===

Half Heusler alloys have a great potential for high- temperature power generation applications. Half-Heusler (HH) are alloys with a Formula ABX . Examples of Half-Heusler include NbFeSb, NbCoSn and VFeSb.  HH possesses cubic MgAgAs type structure, forming three interpenetrating face-centered-cubic (FCC). The ability to substitute any of these three sublattices opens the door for wide variety of HH compounds to be synthesized. A and B sites substitutions are employed to reduce the thermal conductivity, while the X site substitution is used to enhance the carrier concentration and thus the electrical conductivity.&lt;ref name="Huang, Lihong 2016"&gt;Huang, Lihong, et al. "Recent progress in half-Heusler thermoelectric materials." Materials Research Bulletin 76 (2016): 107-112.&lt;/ref&gt;   
		                        		
Previously, ZT could not peak more than 0.5 for p-type and 0.8 for n-type HH compound. However, in the past few years, researchers were able to achieve ZT≈1 for both n-type and p-type.&lt;ref name="Huang, Lihong 2016"/&gt; Nano-sized grains is one of the approaches used to lower the thermal conductivity via grain boundaries- assisted phonon scattering.&lt;ref&gt;Yan, Xiao, et al. "Enhanced thermoelectric figure of merit of p-type half-Heuslers." Nano letters 11.2 (2010): 556-560.&lt;/ref&gt; Other approach was to utilize the principles of nanocomposites, by which certain combination of metals were favored on others due to the atomic size difference. For instance, Hf and Ti is more effective than Hf and Zr, when reduction of thermal conductivity is of concern, since the atomic size difference between the former is larger than that of the latter.&lt;ref&gt;Kimura, Yoshisato, Hazuki Ueno, and Yoshinao Mishima. "Thermoelectric Properties of Directionally Solidified Half-Heusler (M0. 5a, M0. 5b) NiSn (Ma, Mb= Hf, Zr, Ti) Alloys." Journal of Electronic Materials 38.7 (2009): 934-939.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Electrically conducting organic materials===

Some electrically conducting organic materials may have a higher figure of merit than existing inorganic materials. Seebeck coefficient can be even millivolts per Kelvin but electrical conductivity is usually low, resulting in small ZT values. Quasi-one-dimensional organic crystals are formed from linear chains or stacks of molecules that are packed into a 3D crystal. Under certain conditions some Q1D organic crystals may have ZT~20 &lt;!-- (Figure 13) (No ref. given to where this figure is --&gt; at room temperature for both p- and n-type materials. This has been credited to an unspecified interference between two main electron-phonon interactions leading to the formation of narrow strip of states in the [[conduction band]] with a significantly reduced scattering rate as the mechanism compensate each other, yielding high ZT.{{sfn|Rowe|2005|loc=Chapter 36}}

===Silicon-germanium===

[[Silicon-germanium]] alloys are currently the best thermoelectric materials around 1000 ℃ and are therefore used in some [[radioisotope thermoelectric generator]]s (RTG) (notably the [[MHW-RTG]] and [[GPHS-RTG]]) and some other high temperature applications, such as [[waste heat recovery unit|waste heat recovery]]. Usability of silicon-germanium alloys is limited by their price and mid-range ZT (~0.7).

===Sodium cobaltate===
Experiments on crystals of sodium cobaltate, using [[X-ray]] and [[neutron scattering]] experiments carried out at the [[European Synchrotron Radiation Facility]] (ESRF) and the Institut Laue-Langevin (ILL) in Grenoble were able to suppress thermal conductivity by a factor of six compared to vacancy-free sodium cobaltate. The experiments agreed with corresponding [[density functional theory|density functional calculations]]. The technique involved large anharmonic displacements of {{chem|Na|0.8|CoO|2}} contained within the crystals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kurzweilai.net/improved-thermoelectric-materials-may-give-a-push-to-moores-law |title=Improved thermoelectric materials may give a push to Moore's law |publisher=KurzweilAI |date= |accessdate=2013-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Voneshen | first1 = D.

===Amorphous materials===
In 2002, Nolas and Goldsmid have come up with a suggestion that systems with the phonon mean free path larger than the charge carrier mean free path can exhibit an enhanced thermoelectric efficiency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nolas|first1=G.S.|last2=Goldsmid|first2=H.J.|title=The figure of merit in amorphous thermoelectrics|journal=Physica Status Solidi A|volume=194|issue=1|pages=271–276|year=2002|doi=10.1002/1521-396X(200211)194:1&lt;271::AID-PSSA271&gt;3.0.CO;2-T|bibcode=2002PSSAR.194..271N}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can be realized in amorphous thermoelectrics and soon they became a focus of many studies.

It should be mentioned that modelling of transport properties is challenging enough without breaking the long-range order so that design of amorphous thermoelectrics is at its infancy. Naturally, amorphous thermoelectrics give rise to extensive phonon scattering, which is still a challenge for crystalline thermoelectrics. A bright future is expected for these materials.

===Functionally graded materials===
[[Functionally graded material]]s make it possible to improve the conversion efficiency of existing thermoelectrics. These materials have a non-uniform carrier concentration distribution and in some cases also solid solution composition. In power generation applications the temperature difference can be several hundred degrees and therefore devices made from homogeneous materials have some part that operates at the temperature where ZT is substantially lower than its maximum value. This problem can be solved by using materials whose transport properties vary along their length thus enabling substantial improvements to the operating efficiency over large temperature differences. This is possible with functionally graded materials as they have a variable carrier concentration along the length of the material, which is optimized for operations over specific temperature range.{{sfn|Rowe|2005|loc=Chapter 38}}

===Nanomaterials and superlattices===
{{technical|section|date=March 2015}}
In addition to nanostructured {{chem|Bi|2||Te|3}}/{{chem|Sb|2|Te|3}} superlattice thin films, other nanostructured materials, including [[Silicon nanowire|nanowires]], [[nanotubes]] and [[quantum dots]] show potential in improving thermoelectric properties.

==== PbTe/PbSeTe quantum dot superlattice ====
Another example of a superlattice involves a PbTe/PbSeTe [[quantum dot]] superlattices provides an enhanced ZT (approximately 1.5 at room temperature) that was higher than the bulk ZT value for either PbTe or PbSeTe (approximately 0.5).&lt;ref name=harman/&gt;

==== Nanocrystal stability and thermal conductivity ====
Not all nanocrystalline materials are stable, because the crystal size can grow at high temperatures, ruining the materials' desired characteristics.

Nanocrystalline materials have many interfaces between crystals, which [[Sound amplification by stimulated emission of radiation|Physics of SASER]] [[scatter phonons]] so the thermal conductivity is reduced. [[Polaritonics#Guidance and control|Phonons are confined]] to the grain, if their mean free path is larger than the material grain size.

Measured lattice thermal conductivity in ''nanowires'' is known to depend on roughness, the method of synthesis and properties of the source material.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Silicon nanowires as efficient thermoelectric materials|doi=10.1038/nature06458|pmid=18185583|year=2008|last1=Akram I.

==== Nanocrystalline transition metal silicides ====
Nanocrystalline transition metal silicides are a promising material group for thermoelectric applications, because they fulfill several criteria that are demanded from the commercial applications point of view. In some nanocrystalline transition metal silicides the power factor is higher than in the corresponding polycrystalline material but the lack of reliable data on thermal conductivity prevents the evaluation of their thermoelectric efficiency.{{sfn|Rowe|2005|loc=Chapter 40}}

==== Nanostructured skutterudites ====
Skutterudites, a cobalt arsenide [[mineral]] with variable amounts of nickel and iron, can be produced artificially, and are candidates for better thermoelectric materials.
 
One advantage of nanostructured [[skutterudite]]s over normal skutterudites is their reduced thermal conductivity, caused by grain boundary scattering. ZT values of ~0.65 and &gt;&amp;nbsp;0.4 have been achieved with CoSb&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; based samples; the former values were 2.0 for Ni and 0.75 for Te-doped material at 680&amp;nbsp;K and latter for Au-composite at {{nowrap|T &gt; 700 K}}.{{sfn|Rowe|2005|loc=Chapter 41}}

Even greater performance improvements can be achieved by using composites and by controlling the grain size, the compaction conditions of polycrystalline samples and the carrier concentration.

==== Graphene ====

Graphene is known for its high electrical conductivity and Seebeck coefficient at room temperature.&lt;ref name="Anno, Yuki 2017"&gt;Anno, Yuki, et al. "Enhancement of graphene thermoelectric performance through defect engineering." 2D Materials 4.2 (2017): 025019&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mu, Xin, et al. "Thermal transport in graphene oxide–from ballistic extreme to amorphous limit." Scientific reports 4 (2014): 3909.&lt;/ref&gt; However, from thermoelectric perspective, its thermal conductivity is notably high, which in turn limits its ZT. Several approaches were suggested to reduce the thermal conductivity of graphene without altering much its electrical conductivity. These include, but not limited to, the following:

1- '''Doping with carbon isotopes''' to form isotopic heterojunction such as that of 12C and 13C. Basically, those isotopes possess different phonon frequency mismatch, which ultimately lead to the scattering of the heat carriers (the phonons). Fortunately, this approach has been shown to not affecting neither the power factor nor the electrical conductivity.&lt;ref&gt;Anno, Yuki, et al. "Artificially controlled synthesis of graphene intramolecular heterojunctions for phonon engineering." Physica Status Solidi RRL-Rapid Research Letters 8.8 (2014): 692-697.&lt;/ref&gt;

2- '''Wrinkles and cracks''' in the graphene structure were shown to contribute to the reduction in the thermal conductivity. Reported values of thermal conductivity of suspended graphene of size 3.8&amp;nbsp;µm show a wide spread from 1500 to 5000 W/mK. A recent study attributed that to the microstructural defects present in graphene, such as wrinkles and cracks, which can drop the thermal conductivity by 27%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chen|first=Shanshan|last2=Li|first2=Qiongyu|last3=Zhang|first3=Qimin|last4=Qu|first4=Yan|last5=Ji|first5=Hengxing|last6=Ruoff|first6=Rodney S|last7=Cai|first7=Weiwei|date=2012-08-21|title=Thermal conductivity measurements of suspended graphene with and without wrinkles by micro-Raman mapping|url=http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0957-4484/23/36/365701|journal=Nanotechnology|volume=23|issue=36|pages=365701|doi=10.1088/0957-4484/23/36/365701|issn=0957-4484}}&lt;/ref&gt; These defects help scatter phonons.

3- '''Introduction of defects with techniques such as oxygen plasma treatment'''. A more systemic way of introducing defects in graphene structure is done through O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; plasma treatment. Ultimately, the graphene sample will contain prescribed-holes spaced and numbered according to the plasma intensity. People were able to improve ZT of graphene from 1 to a value of 2.6 when the defect density is raised from 0.04 to 2.5 (this number is an index of defect density and usually understood when compared to the corresponding value of the un-treated graphene, 0.04 in our case). Nevertheless, this technique would lower the electrical conductivity as well, which can be kept unchanged if the plasma processing  parameters are optimized.&lt;ref name="Anno, Yuki 2017"/&gt;

4- '''Functionalization of graphene by oxygen'''. The thermal behavior of graphene oxide has not been investigated extensively as compared to its counterpart; graphene. However, it was shown theoretically by Density Functional Theory (DFT) model that adding oxygen into the lattice of graphene reduces a lot its thermal conductivity due to phonon scattering effect. Scattering of phonons result from both acoustic mismatch and reduced symmetry in graphene structure after doping with oxygen. The reduction of thermal conductivity can easily exceed 50% with this approach.&lt;ref&gt;Mu, Xin, et al. "Thermal transport in graphene oxide–from ballistic extreme to amorphous limit." Scientific reports 4 (2014): 3909&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Superlattices and roughness ====
[[Superlattice]]s - nano structured thermocouples, are considered a good candidate for better thermoelectric device manufacturing, with materials that can be used in manufacturing this structure.

Their production is expensive for general-use due to fabrication processes based on expensive thin-film growth methods. However, since the amount of thin-film materials required for device fabrication with superlattices, is so much less than thin-film materials in bulk thermoelectric materials (almost by a factor of 1/10,000) the long-term cost advantage is indeed favorable.

This is particularly true given the limited availability of tellurium causing competing solar applications for thermoelectric coupling systems to rise.

Superlattice structures also allow the independent manipulation of transport parameters by adjusting the structure itself, enabling research for better understanding of the thermoelectric phenomena in nanoscale, and studying the [[Carrier scattering#Phonon Scattering|phonon-blocking electron-transmitting]] structures - explaining the changes in electric field and conductivity due to the material's nano-structure.&lt;ref name=vsco/&gt;

Many strategies exist to decrease the superlattice thermal conductivity that are based on engineering of phonon transport. The thermal conductivity along the film plane and wire axis can be reduced by creating [[Carrier scattering#Phonon Scattering|diffuse interface scattering]] and by reducing the interface separation distance, both which are caused by interface roughness.

Interface roughness can naturally occur or may be artificially induced.

In nature, roughness is caused by the mixing of atoms of foreign elements. Artificial roughness can be created using various structure types, such as [[quantum dot]] interfaces and thin-films on step-covered substrates.&lt;ref name="rtem"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Recent developments in thermoelectric materials|doi=10.1179/095066003225010182|year=2003|last1=Chen|first1=G.|last2=Dresselhaus|first2=M. S.|last3=Dresselhaus|first3=G.|last4=Fleurial|first4=J.-P.|last5=Caillat|first5=T.|journal=International Materials Reviews|volume=48|pages=45–66}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Problems in superlattices =====
'''Reduced electrical conductivity''': &lt;br /&gt;
Reduced phonon-scattering interface structures often also exhibit a decrease in electrical conductivity.

The '''thermal conductivity''' in the cross-plane direction of the lattice is usually very low, but depending on the type of superlattice, the '''thermoelectric coefficient''' may increase because of changes to the band structure.

Low '''thermal conductivity''' in superlattices is usually due to strong interface scattering of phonons. Minibands are caused by the  lack of quantum confinement within a well. The mini-band structure depends on the superlattice period so that with a very short period (~1&amp;nbsp;nm) the band structure approaches the alloy limit and with a long period (≥ ~60&amp;nbsp;nm) minibands become so close to each other that they can be approximated with a continuum.&lt;ref&gt;Rowe, ch. 16, 39&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Superlatice structure countermeasures''': &lt;br /&gt;
Counter measures can be taken which practically eliminate the problem of decreased electrical conductivity in a reduced phonon-scattering interface. These measures include the proper choice of superlattice structure, taking advantage of [[Superlattice#Miniband structrue|mini-band conduction]] across superlattices, and avoiding [[Quantum-confined Stark effect|quantum-confinement]]. It has been shown that because electrons and phonons have different wavelengths, it is possible to engineer the structure in such a way that phonons are scattered more diffusely at the interface than electrons.&lt;ref name=vsco/&gt;

'''Phonon confinement countermeasures''': &lt;br /&gt;
Another approach to overcome the decrease in electrical conductivity in reduced phonon-scattering structures is to increase [[Polaritonics#Guidance and control|phonon reflectivity]] and therefore decrease the thermal conductivity perpendicular to the interfaces.

This can be achieved by increasing the mismatch between the materials in adjacent layers, including [[density]], [[group velocity]], [[specific heat]], and the phonon-spectrum.

Interface roughness causes diffuse phonon scattering, which either increases or decreases the phonon reflectivity at the interfaces. A mismatch between bulk dispersion relations confines phonons, and the confinement becomes more favorable as the difference in dispersion increases.

The amount of confinement is currently unknown as only some models and experimental data exist. As with a previous method, the effects on the electrical conductivity have to be considered.&lt;ref name=rtem /&gt;

Attempts to Localize long wavelength phonons by aperiodic superlattices or composite superlattices with different periodicities have been made. In addition, defects, especially dislocations, can be used to reduce thermal conductivity in low dimensional systems.&lt;ref name=rtem /&gt;

'''Parasitic heat''': &lt;br /&gt;
[[Parasitic heat]] conduction in the barrier layers could cause significant performance loss. It has been proposed but not tested that this can be overcome by choosing a certain correct distance between the quantum wells.

&lt;!-- work to be continued --&gt;
The Seebeck coefficient can change its sign in superlattice nanowires due to the existence of minigaps as Fermi energy varies. This indicates that superlattices can be tailored to exhibit n or p-type behavior by using the same dopants as those that are used for corresponding bulk materials by carefully controlling Fermi energy or the dopant concentration. With nanowire arrays, it is possible to exploit [[semimetal]]-semiconductor transition due to the quantum confinement and use materials that normally would not be good thermoelectric materials in bulk form. Such elements are for example bismuth. The Seebeck effect could also be used to determine the carrier concentration and Fermi energy in nanowires.{{sfn|Rowe|2005|loc=Chapter 39}}

In quantum dot thermoelectrics, unconventional or nonband transport behavior (e.g. tunneling or hopping) is necessary to utilize their special electronic band structure in the transport direction. It is possible to achieve ZT&gt;2 at elevated temperatures with quantum dot superlattices, but they are almost always unsuitable for mass production.

However, in superlattices, where quantum-effects are not involved,  with film thickness of only a few [[micrometre|micrometers]] (µm) to about 15&amp;nbsp;µm, Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Te&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;/Sb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Te&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; superlattice material has been made into high-performance microcoolers and other devices. The performance of hot-spot coolers&lt;ref name=vsco/&gt; are consistent with the reported ZT~2.4 of superlattice materials at 300&amp;nbsp;K.{{sfn|Rowe|2005|loc=Chapter 49}}

Nanocomposites are promising material class for bulk thermoelectric devices, but several challenges have to be overcome to make them suitable for practical applications. It is not well understood why the improved thermoelectric properties appear only in certain materials with specific fabrication processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Bulk nanostructured thermoelectric materials: current research and future prospects|doi=10.1039/b822664b|year=2009|last1=Minnich|first1=A.

SrTe nanocrystals can be embedded in a bulk PbTe matrix so that rocksalt lattices of both materials are completely aligned (endotaxy) with optimal molar concentration for SrTe only 2%. This can cause strong phonon scattering but would not affect charge transport. In such case, ZT~1.7 can be achieved at 815&amp;nbsp;K for p-type material.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Strained endotaxial nanostructure with high thermoelectric figure of merit|doi=10.1038/nchem.955|year=2011|last1=Biswas|first1=Kanishka|last2=He|first2=Jiaqing|last3=Zhang|first3=Qichun|last4=Wang|first4=Guoyu|last5=Uher|first5=Ctirad|last6=Dravid|first6=Vinayak P.|last7=Kanatzidis|first7=Mercouri G.|journal=Nature Chemistry|volume=3|issue=2|pages=160–6|pmid=21258390|bibcode = 2011NatCh...3..160B }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tin selenide===
In 2014, researchers at Northwestern University discovered that tin selenide (SnSe) has a ZT of 2.6 along the b axis of the unit cell.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Ultralow thermal conductivity and high thermoelectric figure of merit in SnSe crystals|doi=10.1038/nature13184|pmid=24740068|year=2014|last1=Zhao|first1=Li-Dong|last2=Lo|first2=Shih-Han|last3=Zhang|first3=Yongsheng|last4=Sun|first4=Hui|last5=Tan|first5=Gangjian|last6=Uher|first6=Ctirad|last7=Wolverton|first7=C.|last8=Dravid|first8=Vinayak P.|last9=Kanatzidis|first9=Mercouri G.|journal=Nature|volume=508|issue=7496|pages=373–7|bibcode = 2014Natur.508..373Z }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Zhang | first1 = H. | last2 = Talapin | first2 = D. V. | year = 2014 | title = Thermoelectric Tin Selenide: The Beauty of Simplicity | url = | journal = Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. | volume = 53 | issue = 35| pages = 9126–9127 | doi = 10.1002/anie.201405683 | pmid = 25044424 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is the highest value reported to date.  This high ZT figure of merit has been attributed to an extremely low thermal conductivity found in the SnSe lattice.  Specifically, SnSe demonstrated a lattice thermal conductivity of 0.23&amp;nbsp;W·m&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;·K&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;, which is much lower than previously reported values of 0.5&amp;nbsp;W·m&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;·K&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; and greater.&lt;ref name="L-D. Zhao 2014"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Zhao | first1 = L-D. | last2 = Lo | first2 = S-H. | last3 = Zhang | first3 = Y. | last4 = Sun | first4 = H. | last5 = Tan | first5 = G. | last6 = Uher | first6 = C. | last7 = Wolverton | first7 = C. | last8 = Dravid | first8 = V. | last9 = Kanatzidis | first9 = M. | year = 2014 | title = Ultralow thermal conductivity and high thermoelectric figure of merit in SnSe crystals | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 508 | issue = 7496| pages = 373–377 | doi=10.1038/nature13184 | pmid=24740068| bibcode = 2014Natur.508..373Z }}&lt;/ref&gt;
This SnSe material also exhibited a ZT of {{val|2.3|0.3}} along the c-axis and {{val|0.8|0.2}} along the a-axis.  These excellent figures of merit were obtained by researchers working at elevated temperatures, specifically {{convert|923|K|C}}.  As shown by the figures below, SnSe performance metrics were found to significantly improve at higher temperatures; this is due to a structural change that is discussed below. Power factor, conductivity, and thermal conductivity all reach their optimal values at or above 750&amp;nbsp;K, and appear to plateau at higher temperatures. However, these reports have become controversial as reported in Nature because other groups have not been able to reproduce the reported bulk thermal conductivity data.&lt;ref&gt;Pai-Chun Wei et al, Nature 539, E1 (2016); https://www.nature.com/articles/nature19832&lt;/ref&gt;
 
[[File:Performance metrics for tin selenide.png|thumb|SnSe Performance Metrics&lt;ref name="L-D. Zhao 2014"/&gt;]]

Although it exists at room temperature in an orthorhombic structure with space group Pnma, SnSe has been shown to undergo a transition to a structure with higher symmetry, space group Cmcm, at higher temperatures.&lt;ref&gt;A. C. Bernardes-Silva, A.F. Mesquita, E. de Moura Neto, A.O. Porto, J.D. Ardisson, G.M. de Lima, F.S. Lameiras, "XRD and 119Sn Mossbauer spectroscopy characterization of SnSe obtained from a simple chemical route," Materials Research Bulletin, 40, 1497–1505 (2005).&lt;/ref&gt; This structure consists of Sn-Se planes that are stacked upwards in the a-direction, which accounts for the poor performance out-of-plane (along a-axis).  Upon transitioning to the Cmcm structure, SnSe maintains its low thermal conductivity but exhibits higher carrier mobilities, leading to its excellent ZT value.&lt;ref name="L-D. Zhao 2014"/&gt;

One particular impediment to further development of SnSe is that it has a relatively low carrier concentration: approximately 10&lt;sup&gt;17&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;.  Further compounding this issue is the fact that SnSe has been reported to have low doping efficiency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Chen | first1 = C-L. | last2 = Wang | first2 = H. | last3 = Chen | first3 = Y-Y. | last4 = Daya | first4 = T. | last5 = Snyder | first5 = G.

A | volume = 2 | issue = 29| page = 11171 | doi=10.1039/c4ta01643b}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
However, such single crystalline materials suffer from inability to make useful devices due to their brittleness as well as narrow range of temperatures, where ZT is reported to be high. Further, polycrystalline materials made out of these compounds by several investigators have not confirmed the high ZT of these materials.

==Production methods==

Production methods for these materials can be divided into powder and crystal growth based techniques. Powder based techniques offer excellent ability to control and maintain desired carrier distribution. In crystal growth techniques dopants are often mixed with melt, but diffusion from gaseous phase can also be used. In the zone melting techniques disks of different materials are stacked on top of others and then materials are mixed with each other when a traveling heater causes melting. In powder techniques, either different powders are mixed with a varying ratio before melting or they are in different layers as a stack before pressing and melting.

There are applications, such as cooling of electronic circuits, where thin films are required. Therefore, thermoelectric materials can also be synthesized using [[physical vapor deposition]] techniques. Another reason to utilize these methods is to design these phases and provide guidance for bulk applications.

==Applications&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Champier | first = Daniel | title = Thermoelectric generators: A review of applications | journal =Energy Conversion and Management Vol. 140 | pages = 162–181 | date = 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;==

===Refrigeration===
{{main|Thermoelectric cooling}}
Thermoelectric materials can be used as refrigerators, called "thermoelectric coolers", or "Peltier coolers" after the [[Peltier effect]] that controls their operation. As a refrigeration technology, Peltier cooling is far less common than [[vapor-compression refrigeration]]. The main advantages of a Peltier cooler (compared to a vapor-compression refrigerator) are its lack of moving parts or [[refrigerant]], and its small size and flexible shape (form factor).

The main ''disadvantage'' of Peltier coolers is low efficiency. It is estimated that materials with ZT&gt;3 (about 20–30% Carnot efficiency) would be required to replace traditional coolers in most applications.&lt;ref name=harman&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1126/science.1072886 |title=Quantum dot superlattice thermoelectric materials and devices|url=http://lib.semi.ac.cn:8080/tsh/dzzy/wsqk/science/vol297/297-2229.pdf|year=2002|last1=Harman|first1=T. C.|journal=Science|volume=297|issue=5590|pages=2229–32|pmid=12351781|last2=Taylor|first2=PJ|last3=Walsh|first3=MP|last4=Laforge|first4=BE|bibcode = 2002Sci...297.2229H }}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, Peltier coolers are only used in niche applications, especially small scale, where efficiency is not important.

===Power generation===
{{main|Thermoelectric generator}}
Thermoelectric efficiency depends on the ''figure of merit'', ZT. There is no theoretical upper limit to ZT, and as ZT approaches infinity, the thermoelectric efficiency approaches the [[Carnot's theorem (thermodynamics)|Carnot limit]]. However, no known thermoelectrics have a ZT&gt;3.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Thermoelectric Materials, Phenomena, and Applications: A Bird's Eye View|url=http://inside.mines.edu/~zhiwu/research/papers/F08_mrs.pdf|doi=10.1557/mrs2006.44|year=2011|last1=Tritt|first1=Terry M.|last2=Subramanian|first2=M. A.|journal=MRS Bulletin|volume=31|issue=3|pages=188–198}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2010, thermoelectric generators serve application niches where efficiency and cost are less important than reliability, light weight, and small size.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Modeling of TE cooling of pump lasers|doi=10.1109/TCAPT.2004.838874|year=2004|last1=Labudovic|first1=M.|last2=Li|first2=J.|journal=IEEE Transactions on Components and Packaging Technologies|volume=27|issue=4|pages=724–730}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Internal combustion engines capture 20–25% of the energy released during fuel combustion.&lt;ref name=yang&gt;{{Cite book|title=ICT 2005. 24th International Conference on Thermoelectrics, 2005|doi=10.1109/ICT.2005.1519911|chapter=Potential applications of thermoelectric waste heat recovery in the automotive industry|year=2005|last1=Yang|first1=J.|isbn=978-0-7803-9552-7|page=170 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Increasing the conversion rate can increase mileage and provide more electricity for on-board controls and creature comforts (stability controls, telematics, navigation systems, electronic braking, etc.)&lt;ref&gt;Fairbanks, J., [http://www1.eere.energy.gov/vehiclesandfuels/pdfs/deer_2006/session6/2006_deer_fairbanks.pdf Thermoelectric Developments for Vehicular Applications], U.S. Department of Energy: Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy. Presented on: August 24, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; It may be possible to shift energy draw from the engine (in certain cases) to the electrical load in the car, e.g. electrical power steering or electrical coolant pump operation.&lt;ref name=yang/&gt;

[[Cogeneration]] power plants use the heat produced during electricity generation for alternative purposes. Thermoelectrics may find applications in such systems or in [[solar thermal energy]] generation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://dao.mit.edu/8.231/TherEleZT.pdf|title=Thermoelectrics: Direct Solar Thermal Energy Conversion|doi=10.1016/0038-092X(80)90311-4|year=1980|last1=Goldsmid|first1=H.J.|last2=Giutronich|first2=J.E.|last3=Kaila|first3=M.M.|journal=Solar Energy|volume=24|issue=5|pages=435–440|bibcode = 1980SoEn...24..435G }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''unimorph''' or '''monomorph''' is a [[cantilever]] that consists of one active layer and one inactive layer.&lt;ref&gt;http://robotics.eecs.berkeley.edu/~ronf/PAPERS/icra01b.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  In the case where active layer is [[piezoelectric]], deformation in that layer may be induced by the application of an electric field. This deformation induces a bending displacement in the cantilever. The inactive layer may be fabricated from a non-piezoelectric material.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4102">'''Ursula Sladek''' (1946-09-06 ) owns a small local power company, Schönau Power Supply, located in [[Schönau im Schwarzwald]], Germany, that provides electricity from [[renewable energy]] sources to the German electricity grid.&lt;ref name="ashoka.org"&gt;{{ cite web | title= Ursula Sladek | work= Ashoka Innovators for the Public | url= http://www.ashoka.org/fellow/ursula-sladek | accessdate= 2012-04-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Her company "gets much of its energy from small local energy producers, including a handful of hydropower operations, solar panels, some wind turbines, and about 20 washing-machine-size co-generation plants in people’s homes that produce both heat for the home and electricity for the grid".&lt;ref name=felicity/&gt; Sladek has also been interested in finding ways of rendering nuclear power unnecessary in Germany:&lt;ref name=felicity/&gt; Sladek won a [[Goldman Environmental Prize]] in 2011.&lt;ref name=felicity&gt;{{cite web |url=http://green.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/04/11/awards-season-for-environmentalists/?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss |title=Awards Season for Environmentalists |author=Felicity Barringer |date=April 11, 2011 |work=New York Times }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
&lt;blockquote&gt;
In 1986, she was a homemaker and the mother of five school-age children when some radioactive isotopes blown into the air by the [[Chernobyl disaster|explosion at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant]] in the Ukraine landed around her town, Schönau, in the [[Black Forest]] in western Germany. Her children could not play outdoors for two weeks; 25 years later, that forest’s mushrooms are still considered unsafe.&lt;ref name=felicity/&gt; 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Trained as a schoolteacher, Sladek began to study the energy industry in Germany to see if there were ways to decrease dependence on nuclear power. Together with her husband, [[Michael Sladek]], she formed a group called "Parents for a Nuclear Free Future" to promote energy efficiency in the Black Forest region of Germany, and return control of energy production and distribution to the community. In 1991, when the previous power company's lease to supply power to the Schönau region was up for renewal, Sladek and her partners began a nationwide fundraising effort to enable them to take ownership of the local power grid.  They were able to raise 6 million DM (about 3 million Euros) and by 1997 had established the Schönau Power Supply as a community operated energy provider committed to a sustainabie energy future. The Schönau Power Supply uses a decentralized approach to power generation, and makes use of renewable energy sources, including solar, hydroelectric, wind power, and biomass. The company is operated as a cooperative; while the cooperative owners receive dividends, the majority of the profits are re-invested in renewable energy sources. Total revenues reached 67 million Euros in 2009&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | title= Prize Recipient, Ursula Sladek, 2011 Europe  | work= The Goldman Environmental Prize | url= http://www.goldmanprize.org/2011/europe | accessdate= 2012-04-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards and recognition==
Ursula Sladek has won many awards for her work in the fields of energy conservation and renewable energy production, including the [[German Federal Cross of Merit]], the Henry Ford European Conservation Award, the German Founder of the Year Award, the International [[Nuclear-Free Future Award]], the German Energy Prize, and the [[European Solar Prize]], and was elected an Ashoka Fellow in 2008.&lt;ref name="ashoka.org"/&gt; Sladek won a [[Goldman Environmental Prize]] in 2011.&lt;ref name="felicity"/&gt;

'''''Voices of the Apalachicola''''' is a book by [[Faith Eidse]] chronicling the history of the [[Apalachicola River]] in Northern [[Florida]], United States. It was the winner of the 2007 [[Samuel Proctor]] Award.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.upf.com/book.asp?id=EIDSEF05&lt;/ref&gt;

Its release of publication in 2006 coincided with increased awareness of the Florida-Georgia dispute over use of the river's resources, and the dying way of life of oyster fisherman in the Apalachicola River Basin, both of which were covered extensively by local press. The book contains [[Oral history|oral histories]] of people who have worked and lived by the river, and builds a history of the culture and environment of the region, which is often regarded as one of the most endangered river systems in the United States.

''Voices of the Apalachicola'' ({{ISBN|0813032121}}) is published by [[University Press of Florida]], 352 pages.

The '''Waterberg''' ({{lang-nso|Thaba Meetse}}) is a mountainous [[massif]] of approximately {{wikidata|property|Q2670965|P2046}} in north [[Limpopo Province]], [[South Africa]].  
The average height of the mountain range is 600 m with a few peaks rising up to 2000 m above sea level. [[Vaalwater]] town is located just north of the mountain range. The extensive rock formation was shaped by hundreds of millions of years of riverine erosion to yield diverse bluff and [[butte]] [[landform]].&lt;ref name="Hogan"&gt;C. Michael Hogan, Mark L. Cooke and Helen Murray, ''The Waterberg Biosphere'', Lumina Technologies, 22 May 2006. {{cite web |url=http://www.luminatechnologies.org/lumaw.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-06-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/67HIjPo9K?url=http://www.luminatechnologies.org/lumaw.html |archivedate=29 April 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ecosystem can be characterised as a [[dry deciduous forest]] or [[Bushveld]]. Within the Waterberg there are [[archaeological]] finds dating to the [[Stone Age]], and nearby are early [[evolutionary]] finds related to the origin of [[human]]s.

Waterberg ([[Thaba Meetse]]) is the first region in the northern part of South Africa to be named as a [[Biosphere Reserve]] by [[UNESCO]].

==Geology==
The underlying rock formation derives from the [[Kaapvaal Craton]], formed as a precursor island roughly 2.7 billion years ago. This crustal formation became the base of the Waterberg, which was further transformed by upward extrusion of [[igneous]] rocks.&lt;ref name = "Taylor"&gt;William Taylor, Gerald Hinde and David Holt-Biddle, ''The Waterberg'', Struik Publishers, Cape Ttown, South Africa (2003) {{ISBN|1-86872-822-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; These extruded rocks, containing [[mineral]]s such as [[vanadium]] and [[platinum]], are called the [[Bushveld Igneous Complex]]. The original extent of this rock [[upthrust]] involved about 250,000 square kilometers, and is sometimes called the Waterberg [[Geologic unit|Supergroup]].

[[Sedimentary]] deposition from rivers cutting through Waterberg endured until roughly 1.5 billion years ago. In more recent time (around 250 million years ago) the Kaapvaal craton collided with the supercontinent [[Gondwana]], and split Gondwana into its modern-day continents. Waterberg today contains [[mesa]]s, [[butte]]s and some [[kopje]] outcrops. Some of cliffs stand up to 550 meters above the plains, with exposed multi-coloured sandstone.

==History==
[[File:Lapalaladeeronrockdown.jpg|thumb|Bushman [[Stone Age]] rock painting, Lapalala Wilderness, Waterberg, South Africa.]]

The [[sandstone]] formations could retain [[groundwater]] sufficient to make a suitable environment for primitive man. The [[cliff]] overhangs offered natural shelters for these early humans. The first [[human]] [[ancestor]]s may have been at Waterberg as early as three million years ago, since [[Makapansgat]], 40 kilometers distant, has yielded [[skeleton]]s of ''[[Australopithecus africanus]]''.&lt;ref name="Hogan"/&gt; Hogan suggests that [[Homo erectus]], whose evidence remains were also discovered in [[Makapansgat]], "may have purposefully moved into the higher areas of the Waterberg for summer (December to March) game".

[[Bushmen]] entered Waterberg around two thousand years ago. They produced [[rock painting]]s at Lapalala within the Waterberg, including depictions of [[rhinoceros]] and [[antelope]]. Early [[Iron Age]] [[settler]]s in Waterberg were [[Bantu peoples|Bantu]], who had brought [[cattle]] to the region. The Bantu created a problem in Waterberg, since cattle reduced [[grass]]land caused invasion of brush species leading to an outbreak of the [[tse-tse fly]]. The ensuing [[epidemic]] of [[African trypanosomiasis|sleeping sickness]] depopulated the plains, but at higher elevations man survived, because the fly cannot survive above 600 meters.

Later people left the first Stone Age artifacts recovered in northern [[South Africa]]. Starting about the year 1300 AD, [[Nguni people|Nguni]] settlers arrived with new technologies, including the ability to build dry-stone walls, which techniques were then used to add defensive works to their [[Iron Age]] forts, some of which walls survive to today.  [[Archaeologist]]s continue to excavate Waterberg to shed light on the Nguni culture and the associated [[dry-stone]] architecture.

The first white settlers arrived in Waterberg in 1808 and the first naturalist a [[Sweden|Swede]] appeared just before mid 19th century. Around the mid 19th century, a group of [[Dutch people|Dutch]] travelers set out from [[Cape Town]] in search of [[Jerusalem]]. Arriving in Waterberg, they mis-estimated their distance and thought they had reached [[Egypt]].

After battles between Dutch settlers and tribesmen, the races co-existed until around 1900. The Dutch brought further cattle [[grazing]], multiplying the impacts of indigenous [[tribe]]s. By the beginning of the 20th century there were an estimated 200 western inhabitants of the Waterberg,&lt;ref&gt;''The Encyclopedic History of the Transvaal'', Praagh and Lloyd, Johannesburg (1906)&lt;/ref&gt; and [[grassland]] loss began to have a severe impact upon native [[wildlife]] [[population]]s.

==Ecology==
[[File:Waterbergoriolesdownsized.jpg|thumb|Male and female Black-headed orioles in [[courtship]] ritual, [[riparian zone]] of central Waterberg, South Africa]]
[[File:Sandrivierberge in Waterberg, Vaalwater, a.jpg|thumb|The Sandrivier range near [[Vaalwater]] constitutes one section of the Waterberg escarpment. It consists of coarse grained, yellow, cross-bedded sandstone.]]

There are several sub-habitats within the Waterberg Biosphere, which is fundamentally a dry deciduous forest; according to Hogan: "These sub-habitats include ''high plateau [[savanna]]'', ''specialized shaded cliff [[vegetation]] system'' and ''riparian zone habitat'' with associated [[marsh]]es".&lt;ref name="Hogan"/&gt;

===Flora and fauna===
The savanna consists of rolling grasslands and a semi-[[deciduous forest]], with trees such as [[Kirkia wilmsii|mountain syringa]], [[Terminalia sericea|silver cluster-leaf]] and [[Heteropyxis natalensis|lavender tree]]. The canopy is mostly leafless during the dry winter. Native grasses include [[Brachiaria serrata|signal grass]], [[Eleusine indica|goose grass]] and [[heather-topped grass]]. Indigenous grasses provide graze to support native [[species]] including [[impala]], [[kudu]], [[klipspringer]] and [[blue wildebeest]]. Some [[Pachypodium habitats]] are found especially in isolated [[kopje]] formations.

Other indigenous mammals include [[giraffe]], [[white rhinoceros]] and [[warthog]]. [[Snake]]s include the [[black mamba]] and [[spitting cobra]]. In 1905 [[Eugene Marais]] studied these snakes of the Waterberg.&lt;ref&gt;Eugene Marais, ''Soul of the Ape'', Human and Rousseau (1937)&lt;/ref&gt; Some birds seen are the [[black-headed oriole]] and the [[white-backed vulture]].&lt;ref name = "Hawthorne"&gt;Tracey Hawthorne, ''Common Birds of South Africa'', Struik Publishing, South Africa (1998) {{ISBN|1-86872-120-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Predators include the [[leopard]], [[hyena]] and [[lion]].

Vegetative cliff habitats are abundant in the Waterberg due to the extensive historic riverine [[erosion]]. The [[African porcupine]] uses the protection of these cliffside caves. Some trees cling to the cliff areas, including the [[Albizia tanganyicensis|paperbark false-thorn]], that have flaking bark hanging from their thick trunks. Another tree in this habitat is the [[fever tree]], thought by [[Bushmen]] to have special power to allow communication with the dead. It is found on cliffs above the Palala River including one site used for prehistoric ceremonies, which is also a location of some intact rock paintings.

[[Riparian zone]]s are associated with various [[river]]s that cut through Waterberg. These surface waters all drain to the [[Limpopo River]] which flows easterly to discharge into the [[Indian Ocean]]. The [[Combretum erythrophyllum|river bushwillow]] is a riparian tree in this habitat. These riparian zones offer habitat for birds, [[reptile]]s and [[mammal]]s that require more water than [[plateau]] species. The riverine areas are inhabited by the [[apex predator]] [[Nile crocodile]] and the [[hippopotamus]]. These wet habitats have reduced numbers of water-living insects, and the Waterberg is thus considered an almost [[malaria]]-free region.

==Land management==
As of 2006 about 80,000 people lived on the Waterberg plateau, which is part of the Bushveld district of Limpopo Province of South Africa. After [[cattle]] [[grazing]] wrought ecological havoc in the mid 1900s, the land owners of the region became aware of the benefits of restoring habitat to attract and protect the original species of antelope, [[white rhino]], [[giraffe]], [[hippopotami]], and other species whose numbers dropped in the era of intense cattle grazing.

The rise in [[eco-tourism]] has stimulated interest in [[soil conservation]] practices to restore original grass species to the Waterberg. The land management practises required are expensive, but repay the landowner with added value in [[wildlife]] habitat. There is also a trend for larger farms and open space areas with the resultant advantage of fence removal. This outcome not only benefits large mammal migration, but yields an improved [[Genetics|gene pool]].[https://geitjie.blogspot.com/2017/07/waterberg.html]

The [[Welgevonden Game Reserve]] covers 37,500 hectares of the plateau.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Welgevonden Game Reserve|url=http://www.welgevonden.org/about/about.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130904161843/http://www.welgevonden.org/about/about.htm|archivedate=4 September 2013|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Kololo Game Reserve covers 3000 hectares, part of which is in the Welgevonden Private Game Reserve, and part of which is completely protected.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Kololo Game Reserve|url=http://www.welgevonden.org/lodges/kololo.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120826171106/http://www.welgevonden.org/lodges/kololo.htm|archivedate=26 August 2012|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18707">The '''West Coast lumber trade''' was a maritime trade route on the West Coast of the [[United States]]. It carried [[lumber]] from the coasts of [[Northern California]], [[Oregon]], and [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]] mainly to the port of [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]]. The trade included direct foreign shipment from ports of the Pacific Northwest and might include another product characteristic of the region, salmon, as in the schooner ''Henry Wilson'' sailing from Washington state for Australia with "around 500,000 feet of lumber and canned salmon" in 1918.&lt;ref name=PMRJan18&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Pacific American Steamship Association; Shipowners Association of the Pacific Coast |year=1918 |title=Tacoma Doings |journal=Pacific Marine Review |volume=Consolidated 1918 issues |issue=January 1918 |page=154 |place=San Francisco |publisher=J.S. Hines |doi= |url=https://archive.org/stream/pacificmarinerev1518paci#page/n91/mode/1up |accessdate=26 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The trade was instrumental in founding shipping empires such as the [[Dollar Steamship Company]] in which its founder, [[Robert Dollar|Captain Robert Dollar]], emigrated from Scotland, worked in the lumber camps of Canada and, after moving to San Francisco in 1888 and buying timber tracts, founded a shipping line that extended to China.&lt;ref name=PMRNov&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Pacific American Steamship Association; Shipowners Association of the Pacific Coast |year=1918 |title=The Dollar Trans-Pacific Service |journal=Pacific Marine Review |volume=Consolidated 1918 issues |issue=November 1918 |pages=72–73 |place=San Francisco |publisher=J.S.

==Lumber schooners==
[[File:C.A. Thayer 1903.jpg|thumb|right|Lumber schooner ''[[C.A. Thayer]]'']]
[[File:StateLibQld 1 145607 Oregon Pine (ship).jpg|thumb|right|Six-masted lumber schooner [[Oregon Pine (schooner)|''Oregon Pine'']]]]

As late as the [[California Gold Rush]], [[New England]] lumber was still carried 13,000 miles around [[Cape Horn]] to [[San Francisco]]. But that started to change when Captain Stephen Smith (of the bark ''George Henry'') established one of the first west coast [[lumber mill]] in a [[Sequoia sempervirens|redwood]] forest near [[Bodega, California]], in 1843. The first lumber mill on the west coast was established by [[John B. R. Cooper]] in [[Rancho El Molino]] near present-day [[Forestville, California]]. By the mid-1880s, more than 400 such mills operated within the forests of California's [[Humboldt County, California|Humboldt County]] and along the shores of [[Humboldt Bay]] alone.&lt;ref name="sfnhp"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.nps.gov/safr/historyculture/ca-thayer-history.htm | title = ''C.A. Thayer History'' | publisher = San Francisco Maritime National Historical Park | accessdate = March 25, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At first, the lumber was shipped in old [[square rig|square-rigger]]s, but these aging ships were inefficient as they required a large crew to operate and were hard to load. Soon local shipyards opened to supply specialist vessels.  In 1865 [[Hans Ditlev Bendixsen]] opened one of these yards at [[Fairhaven, California]] on Humboldt Bay adjacent to [[Eureka, California|Eureka]]. Bendixsen built many vessels for the lumber trade, including the ''[[C.A. Thayer (1895)|C.A. Thayer]]'', now preserved at the [[San Francisco Maritime National Historical Park]]. He constructed 92 [[sailing ship|sailing vessels]] between 1869 and 1901, including 35 three-masters.&lt;ref name="sfnhp"/&gt;

The lumber [[schooners]] were built of the same [[Douglas fir]] as the planks they carried. (Schooner [[Oregon Pine (schooner)|''Oregon Pine'']] was named after the tree.) They had shallow drafts for crossing coastal bars, uncluttered deck arrangements for ease of loading, and were especially handy for maneuvering into the tiny, Northern California ports. Many West Coast lumber schooners were also rigged without [[topsails]], a configuration referred to as being ''baldheaded''. This rig simplified tacking into the strong westerlies when bound north. Crews liked baldheaders because no topmast meant no climbing aloft to shift or furl the sails. If more sail was desired then it could be set by being hoisted from the deck.&lt;ref name="sfnhp"/&gt;

The demands of navigating the [[Redwood Coast]], however, and a boom in the lumber industry in the 1860s called for the development of handy two-masted schooners able to operate in the tiny [[dog-hole ports]] that served the sawmills. Many sites along this stretch of coast utilized chutes and wire trapeze rigging to load the small coastal schooners with lumber. Most of these ports were so small they were called dog-hole ports—since they supposedly were just big enough to allow a dog to get in and out. Dozens of these were built, and almost any small cove or river outlet was a prime candidate for a chute.&lt;ref&gt;''Revamped historic sailing schooner rechristened in S.F. '' ([[Carl Nolte]], Chronicle Staff Writer Thursday, April 12, 2007) [http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2007/04/12/BAGUMP7HEA5.DTL&amp;type=printable]&lt;/ref&gt; Each dog-hole was unique, which was why schooner captains often sailed back and forth to the same ports to load. The mariners were often forced to load right among the rocks and cliffs in the treacherous surf.&lt;ref&gt;''Dog Holes And Wire Chutes'' (in "Maritime Life and Traditions"  by Jevne Haugan. Winter 2005. Number: 029. Page 24)&lt;/ref&gt;

The schooner rig dominated the lumber trade, since its fore-and-aft rigging permitted sailing closer to the wind, easier entry to small ports, and smaller crews than square-rigged vessels.  These ships needed to return to the lumber ports without the expense of loading ballast.  Shipyards built some smaller schooners with centerboards that retracted.  This helped the flat-bottomed vessels to enter shallow water.

At the time of the construction of the [[barque]] [[Hesperus (barque)|''Hesperus'']] in 1882, Jackson writes, "the form of the West Coast lumber vessels had become well established and were a radical departure from the New England built ships." Because lumber is a bulk cargo that does not require shelter, and is difficult to stow below decks, lumber ships from yards such as the Hall Brothers in [[Port Blakely, Bainbridge Island, Washington|Port Blakely, Washington]] were built without the between decks of the New England "Downeasters." "Close to half of their cargo was stowed as deckload – that is above deck."&lt;ref name = "jackson" &gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

Jackson also writes that a triangle trade had developed at this time, with "lumber out to [[Australia]], [[coal]] to [[Hawaii]], and [[sugar]] to San Francisco. It should be noted that the return cargoes were compact and heavy, thus no need for the conventional deep hull form.".&lt;ref name = "jackson" /&gt;

Recently, evidence of the local trade in Northern California was unearthed when a historic oven used in [[Fort Bragg, California|Fort Bragg]] from 1909 until 2003 was discovered to be built with "hundreds of century-old [[brick]]s, many stamped with the name of the California brick factory from which they had come: Richmond, Stockton and Corona." Press coverage states that "these bricks had come north from San Francisco as [[Sailing ballast|ballast]] on lumber ships. In the years after the [[1906 San Francisco earthquake|1906 quake]], Fort Bragg sent tons of timber to the city to be used in rebuilding. Coming home, the ships used bricks from Bay Area factories for weight and for new construction in Fort Bragg."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

Eventually, however, [[steam engine|steam-powered]] vessels proved more dependable than sail, and [[railroad]]s gained greater penetration of the coastal regions. Sailing vessels continued to compete with steamships and railroads well into the 20th century, but the last purpose-built sailing lumber schooner was launched in 1905.&lt;ref name="sfnhp"/&gt;

==Steam schooners==

Soon steam schooners (wooden but powered) replaced the small two-masters in the dog-hole trade and larger schooners, such as the still existing ''C.A. Thayer'' and the ''[[Wawona (schooner)|Wawona]]'', were built for longer voyages and bigger cargo. West Coast shipyards continued to build sail-rigged lumber schooners until 1905 and wooden steam schooners until 1923. In 1907 observers noted the increase in size of schooners.  The first three-masted schooner built on the Coast was launched in 1875.  It was also the first lumber schooner to exceed 300 tons.  Ship wrights built the first four-master in 1886 and the first five-master in 1896.  The later were more generally involved in the overseas trade.  Sail schooners grew from fifty to 1,100 tons during this period.  More than 50 major shipbuilders operated on the Pacific Coast during the era of the coast wise schooners.  Demand for coastwise lumber shipping continued until after the First World War and total lumber transported by the railroads did not exceed its seaborne competition until about 1905.  Even in the 1870s mills shipped lumber directly from some dog-holes to Asia and South America.

'''World Environment Day''' ('''WED''') is celebrated on the 5th of June every year, and is the [[United Nations|United Nation's]] principal vehicle for encouraging awareness and action for the [[environmental protection|protection of our environment]]. First held in 1974, it has been a flagship campaign for raising awareness on emerging [[environmental issue]]s from [[marine pollution]], human [[overpopulation]], and [[global warming]], to [[sustainable consumption]] and wildlife crime. WED has grown to become a global platform for public outreach, with participation from over 143 countries annually. Each year, WED has a new theme that major corporations, NGOs, communities, governments and celebrities worldwide adopt to advocate environmental causes.

==History==
World Environment Day [WED] was established by the [[United Nations General Assembly|UN General Assembly]] in 1972&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.un.org/en/events/environmentday/background.shtml|title=World Environment Day - 5 June|website=www.un.org|language=EN|access-date=2017-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; on the first day of the [[United Nations Conference on the Human Environment|Stockholm Conference on the Human Environment]], resulting from discussions on the integration of human interactions and the environment. Two years later, in 1974 the first WED was held with the theme "Only One Earth". Even though WED celebration have been held annually since 1974, in 1987 the idea for rotating the center of these activities through selecting different host countries began.

== Annual themes and major initiatives and accomplishments ==
{{expand section|date=January 2016}}
For almost five decades, World Environment Day has been raising awareness, supporting action, and driving change. Here is a timeline of key accomplishments in WEDs’ history:
===2018===
The theme for 2018 is "Beat Plastic Pollution". The host nation is India.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://worldenvironmentday.global/|title=World Environment Day|website=worldenvironmentday.global|language=en|access-date=2018-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; By choosing this Theme, it is aimed that people may strive to change their everyday lives to reduce the heavy burden of [[plastic pollution]]. People should be free from the over-reliance on single-use or disposables, as they have severe environmental consequences.  We should liberate our natural places, our wildlife - and our own health from plastics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/world-environment-day-2018-live-updates-host-nation-india-focuses-on-beat-plastic-pollution-theme-1862462|title=World Environment Day 2018 LIVE: Host Nation India Focuses On 'Beat Plastic Pollution' Theme|work=NDTV.com|access-date=2018-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indian government pledged to eliminate all single use of plastic in India by 2022.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/india-aims-to-partner-with-un-to-promote-use-of-solar-energy/articleshow/64476669.cms|title=India aims to partner with UN to promote use of solar energy|date=2018-06-06|work=The Economic Times|access-date=2018-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2017===
The theme for 2017 was 'Connecting People to Nature – in the city and on the land, from the poles to the equator'.

The 2013 theme for World Environment Day was ''Think.Eat.Save.''&lt;ref name="WED2013"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unep.org/wed/theme/ |title="Think.Eat.Save" World Environment Day 5 June |date=5 June 2013 |website=World Environment Day |publisher=United Nations Environment Programme |accessdate=4 June 2013 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6H9cUH2Zw?url=http://www.unep.org/wed/theme/ |archivedate=5 June 2013 |deadurl=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The campaign addressed the huge annual wastage and losses in food, which, if conserved, would release a large quantity of food as well as reduce the overall carbon footprint. The campaign aimed to bring about awareness in countries with lifestyles resulting in food wastage. It also aimed to empower people to make informed choices about the food they eat so as to reduce the overall ecological impact due to the worldwide production of food.&lt;ref name="WED2013"/&gt;.The host country for the year's celebrations was Mongolia.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;poem&gt;
Our cosmic oasis, cosmic blue pearl
the most beautiful planet in the universe
all the continents and the oceans 
united we stand as flora and fauna
united we stand as species of one earth
different cultures, beliefs and ways
we are humans, the earth is our home
all the people and the nations of the world
all for one and one for all
united we unfurl the blue flag.

'''Zellweger''' is the brand name of an [[electric switch]]ing device used for to [[load management|control off-peak electrical loads]] such as water heaters. It is an example of [[carrier current]] signaling.  Power stations transmit a ripple signal   on the main transmission lines when off-peak rates start (often around 10 pm). This ripple noise is picked up by the Zellweger, which after a random delay turns the hot water heater on. The noise is often picked up by other equipment, especially audio amplifiers and stereos and the noise can cause problems with other electrical devices. It is especially audible from ceiling fans running at low speed. Even some telephone lines can pick up the noise. The noise can be particularly obtrusive from some fluorescent light systems.

Newer electrical meters incorporate this technology into the meter. "Time of use" meters charge electricity to the current tariff within half an hour, giving customers incentive to run appliances such as dishwashers, pool pumps and clothes dryers during the night.

== Impact ==
Power stations have plenty of unused capacity late at night but must keep running as they take days to shut down. Off-peak rates are used as an incentive for customers to use this surplus capacity and to reduce the amount of peak demand. This can produce cheaper power by delaying the need to build new power stations and reduce environmental impact.
The random time delay in the Zellweger means that the power stations aren't hit with a huge demand when all the hot water systems turn on at the same time; rather, the load is spread over a greater time period.

== History in Australia ==
[[File:1050HZeg.jpg|thumb|Example capture: The bright line at 50&amp;nbsp;Hz is the power frequency, followed by odd harmonics at 150&amp;nbsp;Hz, 250&amp;nbsp;Hz and so on.  The ripple being turned on and off is clearly visible at 1050&amp;nbsp;Hz]]
Originally time-clocks were used; however, they can easily lose accurate time and are not easily adjusted for [[daylight saving time]]. Zellwegers were first introduced in [[Australia]] in 1953, but were not compliant with modern harmonic disturbance standards. The second generation was introduced in the 1970s and was more reliable. A variety of devices can still be seen across Australia.

In at least some parts of Sydney, the ripple frequency is 1042 Hz.  The signal usually consists of several bursts of a few seconds on and off, followed by a period of up to 50 seconds on.  This is coded to affect only selected equipment.  Occurrences are very frequent, sometimes several times an hour throughout the day, not just at evening and morning off-peak times.

== Radioactive risk of one type of Zellweger meter ==
[[File:Zellweger ZE 22-3 Ripple receiver relay 1050 Hz.JPG|thumb|Zellweger Relay ZE 22/3 with outside cover removed.]]
Zellweger ZE22/3 contain low-risk [[radioactive]] material, and must be only handled by authorised people as breakage of the glass tube could cause a dangerous situation by releasing the radioactive material.  The device &lt;ref&gt;[http://workers.labor.net.au/256/news96_relays.html ETU bulletin]&lt;/ref&gt; reportedly contains a 'glow tube' containing tritium and radium.

== New Zealand equipment ==
A few images are attached from an older electromechanical Zellweger ripple plant near Silverdale. Many of these Zellweger plants are still in use in New Zealand. Frequency used is 1050 Hz, superimposed upon the 50&amp;nbsp;Hz mains. Solid state Zellweger equipment is used as well, which can directly inject into the 22 kV or 33 kV sub transmission mains instead of the 11 kV mains as with these older Zellweger plants.
