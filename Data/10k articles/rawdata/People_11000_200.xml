      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14252">During the Parade of Nations portion of the [[1964 Summer Olympics]] opening ceremony, athletes from each country participating in the Olympics paraded in the arena, preceded by their flag. The flag was borne by a sportsperson from that country chosen either by the [[National Olympic Committee]] or by the athletes themselves to represent their country. Although the Games were held in [[Japan]], [[English language|English]] was used to organize the Parade of Nations instead of [[Japanese language|Japanese]]. Had the parade followed the [[Japanese writing system|Japanese characters]], Greece would have been followed by Iceland, and Rhodesia would have been the penultimate country before [[Japan at the 1964 Summer Olympics|Japan]].

{{Refimprove|date=March 2012}}

His name is Abdul-Uzzai ibn [[Abdul-Muttalib]] ibn [[Hashim ibn Abd Manaf|Hashim]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=أبو لهب عم الرسول, Abu Lahab, Muhammad's uncle |url=https://mawdoo3.com/%D8%A3%D8%A8%D9%88_%D9%84%D9%87%D8%A8_%D8%B9%D9%85_%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B1%D8%B3%D9%88%D9%84 |website=mawdoo3.com |language=ar}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Islamic narrations and inline with Arabic history, '''Abū Lahab''' ({{lang-ar|أبو لهب}}) (c. 549 – 624) was [[Muhammad]]'s paternal uncle. He is condemned in ''Surah al-Massad'', for being an enemy to Islam.

== Family ==
He was born in [[Mecca]] c. 549, the son of [[Abdul Muttalib]], chief of the [[Banu Hashim|Hashim]] clan, and of [[Lubna bint Hajar]],&lt;ref&gt;Ibn Hisham note 97. Translated by Guillaume, A. (1955). ''The Life of Muhammad'' p. 707. Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; who was from the [[Banu Khuza'a|Khuza'a]] tribe.&lt;ref name="soebratie.nl"&gt;[http://www.soebratie.nl/religie/hadith/IbnSad.html#Book 19.6/ Muhammad ibn Saad, ''Tabaqat'' vol. 1 part 1:19:6.]&lt;/ref&gt;
People from the Khuza'a tribe were the caretakers of the Ka'bah for several centuries, before the Quraysh took over the responsibility through their ancestor Qusai ibn Kilab. Abu Lahab was the half-uncle of Muḥammad since Muḥammad's grandmother was Fāṭimah bint ‘Amr of [[Banu Makhzum|Banu Makhzūm]] clan.

His original name was 'Abd al-'Uzzā, but his father called him ''Abū Lahab'' ("Father of Flame") "because of his beauty and charm"&lt;ref name="soebratie.nl"/&gt; due to his red (inflamed) cheeks. He is described as "an artful spruce fellow with two locks of hair, wearing an Aden cloak"&lt;ref&gt;Muhammad ibn Ishaq, ''Sirat Rasul Allah''. Translated by Guillaume, A. (1955). ''The Life of Muhammad'', p. 195. Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; and as "very generous".&lt;ref name="soebratie.nl"/&gt;

He married Arwā [[Umm Jamil|Umm Jamīl bint Harb]], sister of Abu Sufyān (Sakhr), whose father Ḥarb was chief of the [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayya]] clan. Their children included [[Utbah ibn Abu Lahab|Utbah]],&lt;ref name="soebratie.nl"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Muhammad ibn Saad, ''Tabaqat'' vol. 8. Translated by Bewley, A. (1995). ''The Women of Madina'' p. 24. London: Ta-Ha Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Utaybah bin Abu Lahab|Utaybah]],&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Ibn Ishaq/Guillaume p. 170.&lt;/ref&gt; Muattab,&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; Durrah (Fakhita), 'Uzzā and Khālida.&lt;ref&gt;Ibn Saad/Bewley vol. 8 p. 37 (''all three daughters are listed here, with Umm Jamil named as their mother'').&lt;/ref&gt; Abu Lahab had another son, also named Durrah, who may have been borne by another woman.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}} He may also have been the father of Masruh, a son born to his slave Thuwayba.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.soebratie.nl/religie/hadith/IbnSad.html#Book 27.4/Ibn Saad, ''Tabaqat'' vol. 1 part 1:27:4.]&lt;/ref&gt;

His daughter Durrah embraced Islam and became a narrator of Hadīth. One is in Ahmad’s ''Musnad'', where she reports that a man got up and asked the Prophet, “Who is the best of the people?” He answered, “The best of the people is the most learned, the most godfearing, the most to be enjoining virtue, the most to be prohibiting vice and the most to be joining the kin.”{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

‘Utbah also embraced Islam after the conquest of Mecca and pledged allegiance to Muḥammad.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

=== The ''Wa Ṣabāḥah'' (c. 613) ===
When Muhammad announced that he had been instructed by [[God]] to spread the message of Islam openly, the Quran told him to warn his kinsfolk about divine punishment. He therefore climbed [[Al-Safa and Al-Marwah|Mount Ṣafā]] and shouted: "''Wa ṣabāḥah!''" which means, "O calamity of the morning!" In [[Arabian Peninsula|Arabia]] this alarm was traditionally raised by any person who noticed an enemy tribe advancing against his own tribe at dawn.

On hearing this, the inhabitants of Mecca assembled at the mountain. Muhammad then addressed the clans by name. "O Banū Hāshim, O Banū 'Abd al-Muṭallib ... [and so on], if I were to tell you that behind this hill there is an enemy about to attack you, would you believe me?" The people responded that they would, since Muhammad was known to be honest. He continued saying: "Then I warn you that you are heading for a torment."

At this point, Abu Lahab interrupted: "Woe be on you the rest of the day! Is that what you summoned us for?"&lt;ref name="qtafsir.com"&gt;[http://www.qtafsir.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=1063&amp;Itemid=167/ Ibn Kathir, ''Tafsir'' on Q111:1.]&lt;/ref&gt; Another tradition recalls Abū Lahab picking up a stone to throw at his nephew.{{citation needed|date=March 2012}}

Abu Lahab rejected the claims of Muhammad and said: "Muhammad promises me things which I do not see. He alleges that they will happen after my death; what has he put in my hands after that?” Then he blew on his hands and said, “May you perish. I can see nothing in you of the things that Muhammad says.”&lt;ref&gt;Ibn Ishaq/Guillaume pp. 159-160.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The ''Sura'' of Abu Lahab ===
As a direct result of this incident, a chapter of the Quran, ''Al-Masadd'' ("The Palm Fibre"), was revealed about him.&lt;ref name="qtafsir.com"/&gt; Its English translation by Sahih International reads:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.usc.edu/schools/college/crcc/engagement/resources/texts/muslim/quran/111.qmt.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2011-07-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719092218/http://www.usc.edu/schools/college/crcc/engagement/resources/texts/muslim/quran/111.qmt.html |archive-date=2011-07-19 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://corpus.quran.com/concept.jsp?id=abu-lahab|title=Abu Lahab - Ontology of Quranic Concepts from the Quranic Arabic Corpus|website=corpus.quran.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the name of Allah, the most compassionate, the most merciful (بسم الله الرحمن الرحيم)
#Perish the two hands of Abu Lahab, and perish he,
#His wealth will not avail him or that which he gained,
#He will [enter to] burn in a Fire of [blazing] flame,
#His wife [as well] – the carrier of firewood (thorns of Sadan which she used to put on the way of the Prophet).
#Around her neck is a rope of twisted fiber (''masadd'').

Umm Jamil is called “the bearer of the wood” because she is said to have carried thorns and cast them in Muhammad's pathway.&lt;ref&gt;Ibn Ishaq/Guillaume p. 161.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://corpus.quran.com/concept.jsp?id=umm-jamil|title=Umm Jamil - Ontology of Quranic Concepts from the Quranic Arabic Corpus|website=corpus.quran.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Being a next-door neighbor to Muḥammad, she also threw garbage over the wall into Muhammad's house.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

Abu Lahab had married two of his sons to the daughters of Muḥammad, 'Utbah to [[Ruqayyah bint Muhammad|Ruqayyah]] and 'Utaibah to [[Umm Kulthum bint Muhammad|Umm Kulthum]]. However, the marriages were never consummated,&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;Ibn Saad/Bewley vol. 8 p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt; presumably because the girls were so young. After the announcement of ''Al-Masadd'', Abu Lahab told his sons: "My head is unlawful to your head if you do not divorce Muhammad's daughters." They therefore divorced them.&lt;ref&gt;Ibn Ishaq/Guillaume p. 314.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; Abu Lahab's daughter Durrah was at some stage married to [[Zayd ibn Haritha|Zaid ibn Ḥarīthah]], who was at that time regarded as Muhammad's son, and they were later divorced; but the timing of this marriage and divorce is not known.&lt;ref&gt;Muhammad ibn Saad, ''Tabaqat'' vol. 3. Translated by Bewley, A. (2013). ''The Companions of Badr'' p. 32. London: Ta-Ha Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt; Later, she married Ḥārith ibn Naufal of Banu Hāshim; and after his death, she married Dihya ibn Khalifa.&lt;ref&gt;Ibn Saad/Bewley vol. 8 p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other acts of opposition (613–619) ===
When the [[Quraysh (tribe)|Quraysh]] began to torture the Muslims, Abu Lahab's brother [[Abu Talib ibn ‘Abd al-Muttalib|Abu Talib]] called upon the Hashim and Al-Muttalib clans to stand with him in protecting his nephew. It was a custom among the Arabs to staunchly support their own clan. Despite the dissension between Muḥammad and some members of Banu Hashim &amp; Banu Muṭṭalib, most of them stood by him in his predicaments and provided him protection and security except Abu Lahab.&lt;ref&gt;Ibn Ishaq p. 120.&lt;/ref&gt;

Once Abū Lahab asked Muḥammad: "If I were to accept your religion, what would I get?" Muḥammad replied: "You would get what the other believers would get." Abū Lahab responded: "Is there no preference or distinction for me?" In which Muḥammad replied, "What else do you want?" Abū Lahab replied back: "May this religion perish in which I and all other people should be equal and alike!"{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

While Muhammad was praying near the [[Kaaba]], Abū Lahab once threw the entrails of a sacrificed camel over him.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}} Muhammad later told [[Aisha]]: "I was between two bad neighbours, Abu Lahab and [[Uqba ibn Abu Mu'ayt]]. They brought excrements and threw them before my door and they brought offensive material and threw it before my door." Muhammad said he came out of his house, saying: "O sons of Abdumanaf! Is it the behaviour of a neighbour?" and threw the rubbish away.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.soebratie.nl/religie/hadith/IbnSad.html#Book 48.6/ Muhammad ibn Saad, ''Tabaqat'' vol. 1 part 1:48:6.]&lt;/ref&gt;
 
He was overjoyed and expressed his sheer happiness at the news of the death of ‘Abdullah, Muḥammad’s second son and celebrated it with ‘Āṣ ibn Wā’il, Abu Jahl and other enemies of Islam.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} Besides, they also dubbed Muḥammad “al-Abtar”.  So Allah revealed Sūra al-Kaothar.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

On the 7th year of preaching Islam, the Quraysh imposed boycott on Banu Hāshim &amp; Banu Muṭṭalib and forced them to live in a mountain gorge outside the city.  Most of the members of Banu Hāshim had not accepted Islam at that time. Yet they stood by Muḥammad and suffered as much as he did.  Abu Lahab was the only member of Banu Hāshim who supported the boycott and did not join his clan. Through a deep sense of animosity, Abu Lahab violated this ‘Arab tradition and took the side of non-Muslim Quraysh clans. Abu Lahab renounced his affiliation with the Hashim clan and remained in Mecca. Soon afterwards, he met his sister-in-law, [[Hind bint Utbah]], and said to her, "Haven’t I helped [[Al-lāt|Al-Lat]] and [[Al-‘Uzzá|Al-Uzza]], and haven’t I abandoned those who have abandoned them and assisted their opponents?” She replied, “Yes, and may god reward you well, O Abu Utba.”&lt;ref&gt;Ibn Ishaq/Guillaume p. 159.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Between the Boycott and Badr (619–624) ==
After the boycott was lifted, another nephew, [[Abu Salama]], came to Abu Talib asking for protection. When the [[Banu Makhzum|Makhzum]] clan protested about this, Abu Lahab supported his brother. He told the Makhzumites: “O Quraysh, you have continually attacked this ''shaykh'' for giving his protection among his own people. By God, you must either stop this or we will stand in with him until he gains his object.” The Makhzumites wanted to keep Abu Lahab's support, and therefore they agreed not to annoy Abu Salama.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

Abu Talib died in 620,&lt;ref&gt;Ibn Ishaq/Guillaume p. 191.&lt;/ref&gt; From this time, Muhammad went around the trade fairs and markets to tell the Arab tribes that he was a prophet and call them to worship [[Allah]]. Abu Lahab used to follow him around the fairs, saying, “This fellow wishes only to get you to strip off Al-Lat and Al-Uzza from your necks and your allies the ''[[jinn]]'' of the Malik ibn Uqaysh tribe for the misleading innovation he has brought. Don’t obey him and take no notice of him.”&lt;ref&gt;Ibn Ishaq/Guillaume pp. 194-195.&lt;/ref&gt;

Someone reported: “Before my own Islam I used to see the Prophet in markets outside Makkah calling out: ‘People, say there is no deity save Allah and you will prosper.’ People would gather around him but a man, bright faced, intelligent looking, with two locks of hair (hanging down), would appear from the rear and say: ‘This man has renounced the religion (of his forefathers). He is a liar.’ He followed the Prophet wherever he went. The people would enquire who he was to learn that it was his (the Prophet's) uncle.’”{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

Once Abu Lahab chased and hit Muḥammad with stones in one of those markets. He hit  so hard that his feet began to bleed profusely and his slippers were filled with his own blood causing great pain and difficulty in walking.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

Muhammad and most of the Muslims left Mecca in 622, and Abu Lahab had no further direct interaction with his nephew.

== Death ==
When the rest of the Quraysh went to [[Badr, Saudi Arabia|Badr]] to protect the merchant-caravan carrying their property from an expected attack, Abu Lahab remained in Mecca, sending in his place Abu Jahl's brother [[As ibn Hisham|al-‘Āṣ ibn Hishām ibn al-Mughīra]] who owed him four thousand dirhams that he could not pay. So he hired him with them on the condition that he should be cleared off his debt.&lt;ref&gt;Ibn Ishaq/Guillaume p. 291.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first people to reach Mecca with the news of the Quraysh defeat in the [[Battle of Badr]] were al-Haysuman and 'Abdullāh ibn al-Khuzā'ī, who bewailed the fact that so many of their chieftains had fallen on the battlefield. Abu Lahab went to the large tent of [[Zamzam Well|Zamzam]], "his face as black as thunder". Before long, his nephew [[Abu Sufyan ibn al-Harith]] arrived, so he called him over for news. A small crowd gathered around the two as Abū Sufyān told his uncle, "The facts are the Quraysh met our enemy and turned their backs. They [the Muslims] put us to flight, taking prisoners as they pleased. I cannot blame our tribesmen because they faced not only them but men wearing white robes riding piebald horses, who were between heaven and earth. They spared nothing, and no one had a chance."{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

At the other end of the tent, a Muslim freedman named Abu Rafi' and [[‘Abbas ibn ‘Abd al-Muttalib|Abbas]]'s wife [[Lubaba bint al-Harith|Lubaba]] sat sharpening arrows. When they heard the news of the men in white riding between heaven and earth, they could no longer contain their happiness, and Abu Rafi exclaimed: "They were [[angels]]!" Abu Lahab was so furious that he forced the frail Abu Rafi' to the ground and beat him up. Lubaba grabbed a nearby tent pole and hit her brother-in-law over the head, crying: "Do you think that you can abuse him just because Abbas is away?"

Lubaba wounded Abu Lahab so severely that his head was split open, laying bare part of his skull. The wound turned septic, and his entire body erupted into open pustules. He died a week later. This would have been in late March 624.

The smell from Abu Lahab's wound was so repulsive that nobody could come near him. His family left his decaying body decomposing in his home for two or three nights until a neighbour rebuked them. "It is disgraceful. You should be ashamed of leaving your father to rot in his house and not bury him from the sight of men!" They then sent in slaves to remove his body. It was watered from a distance, then pushed with poles into a grave outside Mecca, and stones were thrown over it.&lt;ref&gt;Ibn Ishaq/Guillaume p. 310.&lt;/ref&gt;

A Muslim narration says that after Abu Lahab's death, some of his relatives had a dream in which they saw him suffering in Hell. He told them that he had experienced no comfort in the Afterlife, but that his sufferings had been remitted "this much" (indicating the space between his thumb and index finger) because of his one virtuous deed of manumitting his slave Thuwayba, who had briefly suckled Muhammad.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.soebratie.nl/religie/hadith/IbnSad.html#Book 27.3/ Muhammad ibn Saad, ''Tabaqat'' vol. 1 part 1:27:3.]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1730 Calatayud led a violent rebellion, and became a local hero amongst the plebeian masses of the province.&lt;ref name="go"&gt;González Moscoso, René. ''Historia de las ideas políticas en el mundo y en Bolivia''. Sucre, Bolivia: Editorial "Tupac Katari", 1989. pp. 125-126&lt;/ref&gt;

Calatayud belonged to the sector of educated Mestizos, and was a member of the silversmiths' guild.&lt;ref name="na"/&gt;&lt;ref name="le"/&gt; On December 1, 1730, he led a rebellion  in Oropesa, in response to rumours that an official named Manuel Benero de Belaro had been sent to ensure that the Mestizos paid the same punitive taxes as the indigenous population.&lt;ref name="go"/&gt; Calatayud was twenty-five years old at the time.&lt;ref name="le"&gt;Glick, Thomas F., Miguel Angel Puig-Samper, and Rosaura Ruiz. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=ViZpP_ildjYC&amp;pg=PA212 The Reception of Darwinism in the Iberian World: Spain, Spanish America, and Brazil]''. Dordrecht: Kluwer Academic, 2001. p. 212&lt;/ref&gt; The rebellion united the Mestizos and the indigenous people and spread to the entire Cochabamba province.&lt;ref name="go"/&gt; The provincial capital was surrounded and seized by Calatayud's forces.&lt;ref name="na"&gt;Salomon, Frank, Stuart B. Schwartz, Bruce G. Trigger, Wilcomb E. Washburn, Richard E. W. Adams, and Murdo J. MacLeod. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=TuxGG6pXs-QC&amp;pg=PA530 The Cambridge History of the Native Peoples of the Americas]''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1996. p. 530&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1730 rebellion was characterized by an intersection of ethnic and class conflicts.&lt;ref name="na"/&gt; The rebels ransacked shops and houses and killed 39 Spanish inhabitants of the town. However, once the clergy took to the streets with the sacrament the Mestizo rebels stopped further bloodshed. Two representatives of the creole elite were elected as magistrates.&lt;ref name="br"&gt;Brading, D. A. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=vQdyHIKrqJYC&amp;pg=PA408 The First America: The Spanish Monarchy, Creole Patriots, and the Liberal State, 1492-1867]''. Cambridge [England]: Cambridge University Press, 1991. p. 408&lt;/ref&gt; Because the insurgency was badly organized it could not withstand the counter-attack organized by the creole elite (actioned by the magistrates of Cochabamba). A force led by Rodrígez Carrasco captured and decapitated Calatayud, sending his head to the [[Royal Audience of Charcas]]. Rodrígez Carrasco also issued death warrants against twenty-two of Calatayud's followers.&lt;ref name="go"/&gt;&lt;ref name="br"/&gt;

The revolt led by Calatayud was important for the political development in the area, as it marked the start of a series of revolts that lasted for half a century.&lt;ref name="br"/&gt;

'''William Preston Longley''' (October 6, 1851 &amp;ndash; October 11, 1878), also known as '''Wild Bill Longley''', was an [[United States|American]] [[American Old West|Old West]] [[outlaw]] and [[gunslinger|gunfighter]] noted for his ruthless nature, speed with a gun, quick temper, and unpredictable demeanor. He is considered to have been one of the deadliest gunfighters in the Old West.

== Early life ==
Bill Longley was born on Mill Creek in [[Austin County, Texas]], the sixth of ten children of Campbell and Sarah Longley. His family moved when he was two years old and he was raised on a farm near [[Lincoln, Texas|Old Evergreen, Texas]], in present-day Lincoln, [[Lee County, Texas]], where he spent a large part of his childhood learning to shoot.&lt;ref name="gunfighters"&gt;{{cite book | title = Encyclopedia of Western Gunfighters| last = O'Neal| first = Bill| year = 1979| publisher = University of Oklahoma Press| isbn = 0-8061-1508-4| pages = 192–194}}&lt;/ref&gt; He received an average education for the time. He was six feet (183&amp;nbsp;cm) tall with a thin build, jet black hair, and was just reaching adulthood when the [[American Civil War]] ended in 1865.

By 1867, [[Texas]] was fully under the control of the [[Union Army|Union]] due to the [[Reconstruction Act]]. The military acted in all capacities, including law enforcement, which caused considerable resentment throughout the state. Around this time, Longley dropped out of school and began living a wild life, drinking, and running in the company of others of a similar disposition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Miller |first1=Rick |title=Boastful Bill Longley: Cold-blooded Texas Killer |url=http://historynet.com/we/bllongley/index.html |website=historynet.com |publisher=Wild West Magazine |accessdate=19 September 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060526123117/http://historynet.com/we/bllongley/index.html |archivedate=May 26, 2006 |date=May 26, 2006 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==First murders in Texas==
In 1867 the Longley family farm was just one mile from the [[El Camino Real de los Tejas|Camino Real]], an old [[Spain|Spanish]] royal highway that joined [[San Antonio]] and [[Nacogdoches, Texas]].

In mid-December 1868, three former [[History of slavery in the United States|slaves]] named Green Evans, Pryer Evans, and the third known only as Ned, rode through Evergreen, intending evidently to visit friends further south. Longley, accompanied by a couple of friends, forced the three men at gunpoint into a dry creek bed. Green Evans panicked and spurred his horse to escape. Longley shot at him several times, killing him.

Longley and his friends went through the dead man's pockets, as Pryer Evans and Ned rode away. Although given sole responsibility for the murder, Longley later claimed that he was not the only one shooting. Longley's account of this murder differs from that of his later killings, where he was more inclined to brag about shooting men than to try to divert blame to others. Some versions of Green's killing claim he was a member of the [[Texas State Police]]; the TSP only existed from 1870 to 1873.

Longley drifted around Texas for a time, and while gambling in [[Western saloon|saloon]]s he became acquainted with noted gambler, [[Phil Coe]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/fcocy |title=Coe, Philip Houston |website=tshaonline.org|accessdate=September 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1869, Longley and his brother-in-law, John Wilson, embarked on a crime spree through southern Texas. Together they robbed settlers and in one instance killed a freed slave named Paul Brice in [[Bastrop County, Texas]], after which they stole his horses. They also reportedly killed a freed slave woman in Evergreen.

In March 1870, a $1,000 reward for their capture was offered by the Union military authority. Longley later claimed that Wilson was killed by outlaws in 1870 in [[Brazos County, Texas]], although conflicting evidence suggests he was killed in 1874 in [[Falls County, Texas]].

==U.S. Cavalry career==
Longley left Texas and moved north to avoid the authorities and by May 1870, he had joined a gold-hunting party in [[Cheyenne, Wyoming]].

The gold mining party travelled into the [[Black Hills]] of [[South Dakota]], but a treaty with the [[Sioux]] prohibited mining, and the party disbanded when intercepted by a U.S. [[cavalry]] unit. On June 22, 1870, Longley enlisted for a five-year commitment in the army, joining Company B of the [[U.S. 2nd Cavalry Regiment]]. His unit was stationed at [[Camp Stambaugh]]. He deserted two weeks later, as he was unable to adapt to the strict lifestyle, but was captured and [[court-martial]]ed. He was sentenced to two years hard labour, strapped to a [[ball and chain]], and imprisoned at [[Camp Stambaugh]]. He was held for four months and then released to return to his unit. His marksmanship skills were noticed, and he was assigned to the regular hunting parties leaving the post. He deserted again in May 1872.

==Return to Texas and further murders==
Longley's travels for the rest of 1872 are unknown but by February 1873, he had returned to Texas, where he was accused of murdering another freedman in [[Bastrop County, Texas|Bastrop County]]. He then returned to live with his father's family in [[Bell County, Texas|Bell County]], Texas. In the summer of that year, [[Mason County, Texas|Mason County]] Sheriff, J. J. Finney, arrested Longley for murder and brought him to Austin to collect a reward. However, when the federal military reward was not forthcoming from state officials, Finney released Longley, possibly in exchange for a bribe from Longley's uncle, Alexander "Pres" Preston Longley of California.

On March 31, 1875, Longley shot his childhood friend, Wilson Anderson, dead with a shotgun. The murder was alleged to have been instigated by Longley's uncle, Caleb B. Longley, who had blamed Anderson for the death of his son, Cale, and urged Longley to take revenge. Longley then fled northward, accompanied by his brother, James Stockton Longley, who was later tried and acquitted of Anderson's murder. A new reward was posted for Longley's capture.

Under increasing pressure from law enforcement, Longley fled from place to place and used several aliases to avoid arrest. He briefly found work on a cotton farm, but he was forced to run again in November 1875, after murdering a hunting buddy named George Thomas with whom he had had a fistfight.

Longley committed another killing in [[Uvalde County, Texas|Uvalde County]], Texas in January 1876, when his attempted ambush of fellow outlaw, Lou Shroyer, turned into a gunfight. Shroyer shot Longley's horse from under him, but Longley shot Shroyer dead. This is the only known case in Longley's career where one of his victims returned fire.

Fleeing again, Longley went to east Texas and became a sharecropper for preacher, [[William R. Lay]]. Stability eluded him again, however, when Longley became rivals with Lay's nephew for the affections of a young woman. Longley beat up his rival, was subsequently jailed, and escaped. Longley blamed Lay for his brief imprisonment. On June 13, 1876, Longley rode out to his landlord's farm, found him milking a cow, and murdered him with a shotgun. Lay would be the last man known to be killed by Longley.

Longley then possibly went to [[Grayson County, Texas|Grayson County]], Texas, where two of his friends, Jim and Dick Sanders, were in jail. Longley broke them out, and the trio escaped, disarming deputy Matt Shelton when he tried to arrest them. Approximately one year later, deputy Matt Shelton confirmed this encounter. Longley then fled to [[Louisiana]].

==Capture and execution==
[[File:William preston longley grave.jpg|thumb|rt|250px|Grave site of Bill Longley in Giddings City Cemetery]]
On June 6, 1877, Longley was surrounded and arrested without incident by Nacogdoches County Sheriff, Milt Mast, and two deputies while he was residing in [[De Soto Parish, Louisiana|De Soto Parish]], Louisiana under the [[pseudonym|alias]] "Bill Jackson". He was returned to Texas, tried in the Lee County Court, and sentenced to hang for the murder of Wilson Anderson. His appeal was denied in March 1878. On October 11, 1878, Longley was executed by hanging in [[Giddings, Texas|Giddings]], Texas, only a few miles from his birthplace of Evergreen. His grave and a state historical marker are in Giddings City Cemetery.

He claimed to have killed thirty-two people, mostly of [[Hispanic]] and [[African American]] heritage.&lt;ref&gt;[http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83025287/1878-10-17/ed-1/seq-2/;words=William+P+Longley ''Daily Globe article'']; Chronicling America: St. Paul, Minnesota;  October 17, 1878, Image 2, column 7&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legend, hoaxes, and tall tales ==

===Death hoax===
Years after the execution, Longley's father, Campbell, came forward in a press release stating that his son had ''not'' been executed. He claimed that a wealthy relative in [[California]] bribed the lawmen with $4,000, prompting them to rig a trick rope. They then staged the hanging and whisked the body away. The family even came up with alleged letters said to have been written by Longley from California. The legend spread, and many believed it for quite some time.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}

This prompted many historians to investigate. Finally, after confirming the gravesite of Longley, an exhumation of the human remains was performed. They were taken to the [[Smithsonian Institution]] in [[Washington D. C.]], where [[DNA]] tests were performed, along with a skull reconstruction. In June 2001, it was officially reported that the remains from the gravesite were indeed those of Bill Longley.&lt;ref&gt;Note: One datum in support of this conclusion was that the grave contained a Catholic medallion (The Miraculous Medal, an image of the Blessed Virgin Mary) that Longley was reportedly wearing on the day he was hanged. Longley had converted to Catholicism shortly before his death, as reported by the ''[[Scientific American Frontiers#Season 12 (2001-2002)| Scientific American Frontiers]]'' episode entitled, "Dead Men's Tales".&lt;/ref&gt;

===Unverified claims===
Numerous myths and legends have grown up about Longley that cannot be verified by any contemporary source. Many of these legends trace back to tall tales that Longley himself told while imprisoned in Giddings in 1877. Some of these stories are probably false, while others could be true but lack any contemporary corroborating evidence. Longley's lies appear to have been motivated partly by his desire to rival [[John Wesley Hardin]]'s reputation as a killer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Miller|first1=Rick|title=Boastful Bill Longley: Cold-blooded Texas Killer|website=www.historynet.com|publisher=Wild West Magazine|date=February 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Longley was outraged when he found he was to be put to death, while Hardin was only sentenced to twenty-five years in prison.

The most clearly false story Longley told was of being captured and lynched in 1869 alongside one of [[Cullen Baker]]'s outlaw gang, surviving when a lucky shot severed the rope he had been hanged from, and then joining Baker's riders. As Baker was dead and his band dispersed at the time Longley claimed this happened, the story cannot be true.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Miller and Johnson|2011|p=27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is no contemporaneous evidence to back claims that Longley murdered a black militiaman in Old Evergreen in 1866 for insulting his father, or that he shot eight black people in Lexington in 1867 to avenge the loss of a horse racing bet.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Miller and Johnson|2011|p=16-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, Longley would have been 14 and 15 years old respectively at the time of the alleged incidents. True or false, the stories are consistent with Longley's well-established racist character; in his own words he "was taught to believe it was right to kill sassy negroes."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Miller and Johnson|2011|p=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Longley's account of killing a [[trail boss]] named Rector while en route to Wyoming in 1870 is similarly of unknown veracity.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Miller and Johnson|2011|p=41}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Weapons of choice==
Traditionally, Longley is said to have used a pair of Dance .44 revolvers; the Dance was a Texas-manufactured imitation of the [[Colt Dragoon]].&lt;ref&gt;William Foster-Harris (2007), ''The Look of the Old West: A Fully Illustrated Guide'', Skyhorse Publishing, Inc., {{ISBN|1-60239-024-X}}, p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt; However, he used a shotgun to kill both Wilson Anderson and William Lay, his only murders for which his weapon is definitely known.

==In popular culture==

Longley is a major character in ''The Pistoleer,'' a novel by [[James Carlos Blake]] ([[Berkley Books]], NY, 1995).

In 1954, the [[actor]] [[Douglas Kennedy (actor)|Douglas Kennedy]] played Longley in an episode of [[Jim Davis (actor)|Jim Davis]]'s [[Television syndication|syndicated]] [[Western (genre)|western]] [[television series]], ''[[Stories of the Century]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0710937/| title=''Stories of the Century'': "Bill Longley", May 20, 1954| publisher=[[Internet Movie Data Base]]| accessdate=September 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1958, [[Steve McQueen]] played Longley in Season 2, Episode 23 of [[Tales of Wells Fargo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0717113/| title=''Tales of Wells Fargo'': "Bill Longley", Feb 10, 1958| publisher=[[Internet Movie Data Base]]| accessdate=April 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Longley is the title character in [[The Texan (TV series)|The Texan]], a television series starring [[Rory Calhoun]] which aired on [[CBS]] from [[1958 in television|1958]]-[[1960 in television|1960]], and portrayed Longley in an heroic role, a wanderer throughout the American West who assists those having trouble with the lawless element.&lt;ref&gt;Billy Hathorn, "Roy Bean, Temple Houston, Bill Longley, Ranald Mackenzie, Buffalo Bill, Jr., and the Texas Rangers: Depictions of West Texans in Series Television, 1955 to 1967", ''[[West Texas Historical Association|West Texas Historical Review]]'', Vol. 89 (2013), pp. 110-112&lt;/ref&gt;

Longley figures prominently in [[Louis L'Amour]]'s 1959 [[novel]] ''The First Fast Draw'', a highly fictionalized version of Cullen Baker's life.

Texas singer/songwriter, Houston Marchman, wrote a song about Longley, ''Bill Longley,'' which is on his second CD ''Leavin' Dallas'' (1999).&lt;ref name="All Country Tabs"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allcountrytabs.com/tabs/houston-marchman/bill-longley-10703.html|title=Marchman Houston, Bill Longley Tabs|work=Bill Longley}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Blair Timmothy Longley''' (born September 25, 1950) is a [[Canadians|Canadian]] [[politician]] and [[activist]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marijuanaparty.ca/article.php3?id_article=161 Bio from the Marijuana Party website]&lt;/ref&gt;

He joined the [[Marijuana Party (Canada)|Marijuana Party]] shortly after its founding and he became the leader of the Marijuana Party in 2005, following the resignation of [[Marc-Boris St-Maurice]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/canadavotes2006/leadersparties/leaders/bio_otherleaders.html#mbsm|title=Leaders and Parties -Blair Longley Marijuana Party|publisher=[[CBC.ca]]|accessdate=29 August 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160330103133/http://www.cbc.ca/canadavotes2006/leadersparties/leaders/bio_otherleaders.html|archive-date=30 March 2016|dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He has been a candidate for the [[House of Commons of Canada]] on three occasions, each time with a different party label.

The '''celebrity-industrial complex''' is a social and economic construct which involves a symbiotic relationship between [[celebrity|celebrities]] and business corporations. First proposed by ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'' [[columnist]] [[Maureen Orth]] in her book, ''[[The Importance of Being Famous]]'' (2003), it is fueled both by the celebrities' seemingly continual search for fame and attention and the business corporations' search for catchy headlines and viable name brands that could be sustained by such celebrities.

In the celebrity-industrial complex, the celebrity either has a particular feature that is attractive to a public audience or is a victim of an occurrence that wins sympathy or condemnation from that same audience; this celebrity, for an initial period of time, becomes a subject of media scrutiny or marketing by properly funded media publication distributors. This media scrutiny, however, can often become a source of income for the celebrity, or the media scrutiny becomes an outlet of promotion for future manufactured publications or initiatives by the celebrities, and the media scrutiny around the celebrity expands to include coverage of such products.

The term "celebrity-industrial complex" is an homage to the much older term [[military–industrial complex]], which refers to a similar bilateral relationship between national militaries and industrial corporations which profit from each other.

'''Cornelius Wilhelmus "Corra" Dirken''' (born 22 January 1938 in Vereeniging, South Africa) is a former [[South Africa national rugby union team|South African]] [[Rugby union|rugby]] player. He won 10 caps and scored three tries.

==Rugby career==
Dirksen made his international debut against [[Australia national rugby union team|Australia]] in 1963. The 1967 series against [[France national rugby union team|France]] was probably his finest hour, scoring all three of his test tries against them. The French were understandably quite wary of him throughout that series, dubbing him ''Le Monster'' (The Monster).

He played for the then Northern Transvaal (now Blue Bulls) and the Oostelikes (Easterns) club in Pretoria, which later merged with Adelaars to form Naka Bulls. After retiring from playing he qualified as a medical practitioner, and moved to Johannesburg, Krugersdorp.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3976">The '''Crazy Canucks''' was a group of  [[FIS Alpine Ski World Cup|World Cup]] [[Alpine skiing|alpine ski racers]] from [[Canada]] who rose to prominence in the 1970s and 1980s. Jungle [[Jim Hunter (skier)|Jim Hunter]], [[Dave Irwin]], [[Dave Murray (skier)|Dave Murray]], [[Steve Podborski]], and [[Ken Read]] earned themselves a reputation for fast and seemingly reckless skiing in the [[Downhill (ski competition)|downhill]] event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1066985/index.htm |magazine=Sports Illustrated |title=Wild and crazy guys |last=Ballard |first=Sarah |date=January 27, 1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These five men earned their title "Crazy Canucks" from ski journalist and World Cup co-founder [[Serge Lang (skiing)|Serge Lange]], who after watching their different styles came up with the name that caught on with sports journalists throughout the skiing world&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.daveirwinfoundation.org/crazycanucks.html]" - Dave Irwin Foundation "The Crazy Canucks" - Retrieved 4 April 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Other similar nicknames included "[[Kamikaze]] Canadians."&lt;ref name=kmkecnd&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=xH0xAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=5aEFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5240%2C2441998|newspaper=Montreal Gazette |agency=''The Canadian'' (insert magazine) |last=Scammell |first=Ron |title=The Kamikaze Canadians |date=December 9, 1978 |page=10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

These five men were at the top of their game and better known in Europe than in North America.  Once they hit the European hills, they consistently challenged the Europeans on the World Cup circuit at a level previously unseen.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.cbc.ca/archives/categories/sports/skiing/the-crazy-canucks-canadas-skiing-heroes/the-crazy-canucks-more-famous-in-europe.html]" - CBC Digital Archives "The Crazy Canucks, more famous in Europe". Retrieved 4 April 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

Four of the five "Crazy Canucks" live on today.  Dave Murray, 37, died of skin cancer on October 23, 1990.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://go.galegroup.com/ps/retrieve.do?retrieveFormat=PDF_FROM_CALLISTO&amp;inPS=true&amp;prodId=AONE&amp;userGroupName=utoronto_main&amp;workId=PI-1565-2009-DEC00-IDSI-28.JPG%7CPI-1565-2009-DEC00-IDSI-29.JPG%7CPI-1565-2009-DEC00-IDSI-30.JPG%7CPI-1565-2009-DEC00-IDSI-31.JPG%7CPI-1565-2009-DEC00-IDSI-32.JPG&amp;docId=GALE%7CA227182622&amp;callistoContentSet=PER&amp;isAcrobatAvailable=false]" - Crazy Cool "Legend of the Crazy Canucks - January 2010. Retrieved 4 April 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, it was announced that the four original Crazy Canucks would be receiving stars on [[Canada's Walk of Fame]]. They would all be inducted as one group. The only other skier on the walk is Canadian skiing legend [[Nancy Greene]].

==TV film==
''Crazy Canucks'' was a [[TV movie]] named after and based on the history of the team. It was released in [[2004 in film|2004]] in [[Canada]]. The film was directed by Randy Bradshaw and starred Sandy Robson (Hunter), [[Lucas Bryant]] (Read), [[Curtis Harrison]] (Podborski), [[Kyle Labine]] (Murray) and [[Robert Tinkler]] (Irwin).

'''Exequiel Ezcurra''' (born March 21, 1950, Buenos Aires, Argentina) is a plant ecologist and conservationist. His highly interdisciplinary work spans desert plant ecology, mangroves, island biogeography, sea birds, fisheries, oceanography, and deep-sea ecosystems.

He is currently the Director of the University of California Institute for Mexico and the United States ([[University of California Institute for Mexico and the United States|UC MEXUS]]), as well as a Professor of Plant Ecology at [[University of California, Riverside|UC Riverside]]. Ezcurra is also on the board of [[Ensenada Center for Scientific Research and Higher Education|CICESE]], the Ensenada Center for Scientific Research and Higher Education.

==Education==
Ezcurra received his B.S. from the [[University of Buenos Aires]] in 1973. He then received an M.Sc. and a Ph.D. in Plant Biology from [[Bangor University|University College of North Wales]] in 1978 and 1984, respectively. At Bangor, one of his primary mentors was Peter Greig-Smith, a renowned ecologist whose academic lineage of mentors can be traced back to [[Charles Darwin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Peter Greig-Smith|url=http://www.oxfordbibliographies.com/view/document/obo-9780199830060/obo-9780199830060-0089.xml|website=Oxford Bibliographies, Oxford University Press, UK}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Career==
Ezcurra was the Principal Researcher in charge of the Laboratory of Community Ecology at National Autonomous University of Mexico ([[National Autonomous University of Mexico|UNAM]]) from 1987 to 1998. In 1998, Ezcurra moved to San Diego, California to take on the roles of Director of the Biodiversity Research Center of the Californias, and Deputy Director of Research and Collections at the [[San Diego Natural History Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=San Diego Natural History Museum Welcomes Dr. Exequiel Ezcurra as Director of the Biodiversity Research Center for the Californias|url=http://laprensa-sandiego.org/archieve/may01/museum.htm|website=La Prensa San Diego}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001, Ezcurra left US to accept the position of President of Mexico’s National Institute of Ecology and Climate Change (''Instituto Nacional de Ecología y Cambio Climático''), independent research branch of Mexico’s Ministry of the Environment and Natural Resources (Secretaría de Medio Ambiente y Recursos Naturales) from 2001 to 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Guillén|first1=Fedro Carlos|title=Instituto Nacional de Ecología. Quince años de políticas ambientales en México. Memoria testimonial|date=2007|publisher=Instituto Nacional de Ecología|isbn=9688178799|page=141|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GTMw5a0D84MC&amp;pg=PA141&amp;lpg=PA141&amp;dq=exequiel+ezcurra+instituto+nacional+de+ecologia&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=iB1IGxZHmA&amp;sig=10u1j4CWDQbDYJ2ckQFtgSnBqgw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwif8sTh87_TAhWrrlQKHXtVDmYQ6AEIPjAD#v=onepage&amp;q=exequiel%20ezcurra%20instituto%20nacional%20de%20ecologia&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ezcurra returned to the San Diego Natural History Museum where he remained until 2008, when he assumed his current roles as Professor of Plant Ecology at UC Riverside, and Director of UC MEXUS (the University of California Institute for Mexico and the United States). Ezcurra has also served as President of the Board of the Mexican National Commission of Protected Natural Areas ([[Mexican Protected Natural Areas|CONANP]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Comunicados de Prensa|url=http://www.conanp.gob.mx/difusion/comunicado.php?id_subcontenido=277|website=CONANP}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Scientific Chair for the [[CITES]] Convention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Exequiel Ezcurra|url=http://www.worldwildlife.org/leaders/exequiel-ezcurra--2|website=World Wildlife Fund}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As an active member of the Mexican National System of Researchers (''[[Sistema Nacional de Investigadores]]''), Ezcurra also lectures and is a graduate adviser at a number of Mexican universities and research centers. In addition, he is an adjunct professor at the [[Scripps Institution of Oceanography]].

Other achievements from Dr. Ezcurra’s 40-year research career, include developing the first environmental impact assessments in Mexico, playing a central part in the establishment of multiple natural protected areas (including the [[El Pinacate y Gran Desierto de Altar Biosphere Reserve]] and the Islands of the Gulf of California). Dr. Ezcurra also played a key role in promoting the creation of the [[California condor]] release program in Baja California, and initiating the successful restoration of Guadalupe Island in the Mexican Pacific.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Researchers|url=http://nextgensd.com/researcher/exequiel-ezcurra/|website=N-Gen}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Research===
Ezcurra has published more than 170 research papers, books, and book chapters. These include three books about the Gulf of California and its surrounding islands, and a large number of essays and articles for newspapers and popular journals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Exequiel Ezcurra|url=https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&amp;user=RyB1baIAAAAJ&amp;view_op=list_works&amp;sortby=pubdate|website=Google Scholar|publisher=Google}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ezcurra's areas of research include conservation science, the ecology and biogeography of coastal deserts, land-ocean interactions and their impact on both marine and terrestrial environments, the application of mathematical modeling in ecology and conservation, and the management of natural resources in areas under traditional use. In his career as a plant ecologist, Dr. Ezcurra has worked to describe the relationships between marine and terrestrial ecological systems, and the processes that drive highly productive environments. His academic works include a range of highly-cited papers covering desert plant ecology,&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g. [http://ezcurralab.ucr.edu/eezcurra/publications/papers/14.pdf Ezcurra et al. 1987]; [http://ezcurralab.ucr.edu/eezcurra/publications/papers/30.pdf Valiente-Banuet et al. 1991]; [http://ezcurralab.ucr.edu/eezcurra/publications/papers/81.pdf Caso et al. 2007]; [http://ezcurralab.ucr.edu/eezcurra/publications/papers/126.pdf Delgado-Fernández et al. 2016]&lt;/ref&gt; mangroves,&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g. [http://ezcurralab.ucr.edu/eezcurra/publications/papers/21.pdf López-Portillo &amp; Ezcurra 1989]; [http://ezcurralab.ucr.edu/eezcurra/publications/papers/86.pdf Aburto-Oropeza et al. 2008]; [http://ezcurralab.ucr.edu/eezcurra/publications/papers/95.pdf López-Medellín et al. 2011]; [http://ezcurralab.ucr.edu/eezcurra/publications/papers/125.pdf Ezcurra et al. 2016]&lt;/ref&gt; island biogeography,&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g. [http://ezcurralab.ucr.edu/eezcurra/publications/papers/85.pdf Garcillán et al. 2008], [http://ezcurralab.ucr.edu/eezcurra/publications/papers/108.pdf Velarde et al. 2014], [http://ezcurralab.ucr.edu/eezcurra/publications/papers/109.pdf Wilder et al. 2014]&lt;/ref&gt; sea birds,&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g. [http://ezcurralab.ucr.edu/eezcurra/publications/papers/71.pdf Velarde et al. 2004], [http://ezcurralab.ucr.edu/eezcurra/publications/papers/102.pdf Velarde et al. 2013], [http://ezcurralab.ucr.edu/eezcurra/publications/papers/113.pdf Velarde et al. 2015]&lt;/ref&gt; fisheries, oceanography, and deep sea ecosystems.

One of the principal strengths and contributions of Ezcurra’s ecological research is the ability to document the individual components of an ecosystem and then synthesize these components at a regional landscape level. Examples of this approach include:

===Conservation===
Dr. Ezcurra is known for translating scientific research into tangible, positive conservation outcomes. His work has influenced policy at the highest levels of government. It has also created strong and lasting collaborations between the governments of Mexico and the United States, as well as between academic institutions and non-governmental organizations from both countries. Specific instances include: 
* The first Environmental Impact Assessments for impacts to mangrove forests  on Mexico's Yucatán Peninsula
* The establishment of El Pinacate and Gran Desierto de Altar Biosphere Reserve in 1993 and its subsequent classification as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2013,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=El Pinacate and Gran Desierto de Altar Biosphere Reserve|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1410|website=UNESCO}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The establishment of the Islands and Protected Areas of the Gulf of California UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=World-class Ecologist Appointed Director of University of California Institute for Mexico and the United States|url=http://newsroom.ucr.edu/1966|website=UCR Newsroom}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The establishment of [[Cabo Pulmo National Park|Cabo Pulmo Natural Protected area]], in Baja California Sur, Mexico, in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Programa de  Conservación y Manejo Parque Nacional Cabo Pulmo|publisher=CONANP-SEMANART|url=http://www.conanp.gob.mx/que_hacemos/pdf/programas_manejo/cabo.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Science Popularization===
From the outset of his career, Ezcurra has pursued the dissemination of science to the general public through his writing, museum work, and other creative media. Some notable examples include his roles as the:
* Science script writer, producer, and narrator of the award winning giant-screen film "Ocean Oasis" (1999)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Exequiel Ezcurra|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1011073/|website=IMDB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gilly Roach''' is a [[Character (arts)|fictional character]] from the [[Television in the United Kingdom|British]] [[Channel 4]] [[soap opera]], ''[[Hollyoaks]]'', played by [[Anthony Quinlan]]. The character debuted on-screen during the episode airing on 4 October 2005. Gilly was created in 2005 by executive producer David Hanson. Gilly has often been portrayed as a push-over and has a double act partnership with fellow character [[Rhys Ashworth]]. His main character traits have been his "nice attitude", with Quinlan branding Gilly in his first five years as a "push-over". He has been labelled a loser and unlucky in love after failed relationships with [[Jessica Harris (Hollyoaks)|Jessica Harris]] ([[Jennifer Biddall]]), [[Beth Clement]] ([[Sinéad Moynihan]]), [[Cheryl Brady]] ([[Bronagh Waugh]]) and [[Jem Costello]] (Helen Russell-Clark). In 2009, executive producer [[Lucy Allan (producer)|Lucy Alan]] made changes to the character and reached a mutual agreement with Quinlan to shave off his hair, which has characterised Gilly during his early years.

In 2010 he was paired with [[Steph Cunningham]] ([[Carley Stenson]]), who was later killed off after Stenson quit her role. This resulted in a long-running storyline for Gilly in which he was seen taking a "dark journey" unable to cope with grief. Another big storyline for the character occurs in 2011 when [[Jacqui McQueen]] ([[Claire Cooper]]) accuses him of [[rape]]; the storyline subsequently received media attention. A fictional jury consisting of viewers is to decide if he is guilty or innocent. Other storylines have involved the effects of [[binge drinking]], which was portrayed during an online spin-off drama. Gilly has sometimes proved unpopular with television critics, with one branding him a "dampy drizzle of a character". Quinlan has also been nominated for minor awards for his portrayal. In 2011, it was announced that Quinlan would be leaving the serial to pursue other projects and would leave at the end of the rape storyline.

==Character development==

===Relationship with Beth Clement===
[[BBC America]] described Gilly on their official website stating: "His most endearing quality is his honesty and despite his countless flaws, what you see is what you get. He's hardly a ladykiller but what he lacks in appearance he makes up for with charisma."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=BBC America - Hollyoaks - Gilly Roach (Above/Left Corner)|url=http://www.bbcamerica.com/content/232/index.jsp|work=[[BBC America]] |publisher=([[BBC]])|accessdate=1 January 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707214855/http://www.bbcamerica.com/content/232/index.jsp|archivedate=7 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[E4 (channel)|E4]] publicity describe Gilly as fun-loving and always trying to woo females&lt;ref name="ho"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.e4.com/hollyoaks/cast/boys/gillyroach.html|title=Gilly Roach (played by Anthony Quinlan)|work=[[E4 (channel)|E4]]|publisher=([[Channel 4|Channel 4 Television Corporation]])|year=2009|accessdate=20 February 2010|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5vQGWwExb?url=http://www.e4.com/hollyoaks/cast/boys/gillyroach.html|archivedate=1 January 2011|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; but hardly manages to impress them and has also been described as unlucky-in-love after his failed relationships. Initially he failed to impress females and didn't have much in common with them. Gilly has been portrayed as a strong supporter of [[Manchester City F.C.]], it was this single thing that drew him and [[Beth Clement]] ([[Sinéad Moynihan]]) together.&lt;ref name="u"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://holysoap.five.tv/cast/gilly-roach-435 |title=Holy Soap &gt; Cast &gt; Gilly Roach |work=[[Holy Soap]] |publisher=([[Channel 5 Broadcasting]]) |year=2008 |accessdate=20 February 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5vQGeMY4q?url=http://holysoap.five.tv/cast/gilly-roach-435 |archivedate= 1 January 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Gilly was later made a fool by Beth and his best friend [[Rhys Ashworth]] ([[Andrew Moss]]) after they continued an affair despite the fact they were siblings, they split, Beth subsequently died and due to Gilly's forgiving personality he later forgave Rhys.&lt;ref name="u"/&gt; [[Holy Soap]] opined that this was a stand out moment of the character's duration.&lt;ref name="u"/&gt; Another storyline showing his timid personality was when he was mugged by a group of teenagers&lt;ref name=lod&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/scoop/a137131/windass-street-arrival-hollyoaks-mugging.html|title=Windass Street arrival, 'Hollyoaks' mugging|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hachette Filipacchi Médias|Hachette Filipacchi UK]]|author=Green, Kris|date=30 November 2008|accessdate=20 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was left fearing for his safety and even let them pick on him on the streets. In a further twist Gilly was left feeling so ashamed of the attack he pretended it was adult attackers fearing what people would think of him.&lt;ref name=lod/&gt;

===Binge drinking===
During a spin-off series titled ''[[Hollyoaks: The Morning After The Night Before]]'', Gilly and [[Josh Ashworth]] head to [[Manchester]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.e4.com/hollyoaks/the-morning-after-the-night-before/features/news/week5/090709.html|title=Gilly's going to Maaaanchester!

His mood changed further when he attempted to run after Josh after the scuffle, and fell down a set of stairs in the nightclub, losing some of his teeth. After the incident he couldn't wait to get back home to the village."&lt;ref name="holy"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://holysoap.five.tv/news/anthony-quinlan-i-want-to-play-a-girl-1630|title=Anthony Quinlan: I want to play a girl!|work=[[Holy Soap]]|publisher=[[Channel 5 Broadcasting]]|author=|date=23 July 2009|accessdate=20 February 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5vQGrg7wT?url=http://holysoap.five.tv/news/anthony-quinlan-i-want-to-play-a-girl-1630|archivedate=1 January 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[Image:GillyRoach.jpg|200px|left|thumb|Gilly as he appeared during his early years in the series]]He then stated that he wanted viewers to learn from his character's scenario and be responsible while drinking, stating: "It will make people think twice about binge drinking and make people aware of the consequences if you do."&lt;ref name="holy"/&gt; When the character lost his teeth it made the character's low confidence worsen, Quinlan made comment of this saying: "Gilly's confidence was always low really - self-confidence, self-belief. But having no teeth isn't good to look at - not a good look. It's going to draw attention to him and not do him any favours."&lt;ref name="e"/&gt; To enable continuity the character was scripted a slight [[Speech disorder|speech impediment]], behind the scenes Quinlan had a special palette fitted,&lt;ref name="e"/&gt; it was a real one fitted by real life dentists and paid for by the show, it would black the character's front teeth and leave a chipped one at the side.&lt;ref name="e"/&gt; Quinlan also revealed it was quite difficult to speak when wearing it, but praised it as being realistic to have some form of speech impediment having teeth knocked out.&lt;ref name="e"/&gt; Talking of his character's changes and lessons learnt during the special episodes Quinlan said: "I think Gilly's learnt to chill out a little, not to follow the crowd and be a sheep. Everyone was drinking loads, he got caught up in it and he came out on the wrong side of it. So, I think there is a lesson learned there - Gilly will do his own thing and not drink as much."&lt;ref name="e"/&gt;

===Relationship with Steph Cunningham===
Gilly was later seen using his new look in attempt to get the affections of [[Steph Cunningham]] ([[Carley Stenson]]). After failing he acted out of character and struck up a scam date with [[Cheryl Brady]] ([[Bronagh Waugh]]) to make Steph jealous but it back-fired when his false tooth came loose in Cheryl's mouth.&lt;ref name="tooth"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s13/hollyoaks/news/a184013/potd-cheryl-and-gilly-dive-in-for-a-kiss.html|title=POTD: Cheryl and Gilly dive in for a kiss|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hachette Filipacchi Médias|Hachette Filipacchi UK]]|author=Green, Kris|date=28 October 2009|accessdate=20 February 2010 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5vQGvP2QR?url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s13/hollyoaks/news/a184013/potd-cheryl-and-gilly-dive-in-for-a-kiss.html|archivedate=1 January 2011 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later has relationships with Cheryl and [[Jem Costello]] (Helen Russell-Clark).&lt;ref name=jemjem/&gt; Another change implemented during this period was a dramatic change to the character's appearance after new series producer [[Lucy Allan (producer)|Lucy Allan]] and Quinlan came to a mutual decision to transform his hairstyle by shaving it all off, a stark contrast as during his early years he was constantly seen with long hair.&lt;ref name="holy"/&gt;

After Gilly eventually starts a relationship with Steph, she is diagnosed with cervical cancer and initially keeps the news a secret from him.&lt;ref name="pleased"&gt;{{Cite web|last=Kilkelly|first=Daniel|title='Oaks actress pleased with cancer plot|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s13/hollyoaks/news/a222307/oaks-actress-pleased-with-cancer-plot.html|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=([[Hachette Filipacchi Médias|Hachette Filipacchi UK]])|accessdate=9 October 2010|date=28 May 2010|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5tnm55e0h?url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s13/hollyoaks/news/a222307/oaks-actress-pleased-with-cancer-plot.html|archivedate=27 October 2010|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stenson spoke of Steph's reasoning stating: "With Gilly, she's embarrassed and doesn't want him to look after her."&lt;ref name="pleased"/&gt; Speaking of the storyline Quinlan stated during an interview with ''[[Inside Soap]]'': "I think Gilly's really gutted that he didn't get together with Steph sooner - he wasted so much time with Cheryl and Jem, when really he was in love with her."&lt;ref name="wedding"&gt;{{Cite web|last=Kilkelly|first=Daniel|title=Quinlan eager for 'Hollyoaks' wedding|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s13/hollyoaks/news/a268344/quinlan-eager-for-hollyoaks-wedding.html|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=([[Hachette Filipacchi Médias|Hachette Filipacchi UK]])|accessdate=1 January 2011|date=27 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; At one point Steph cancels her wedding to Gilly because he cannot accept she is dying, of this Quinlan states: "His denial is not helping her.

'''Frans Hendrik Karel Zaalberg''' (26 November 1873 – 13 February 1928) was an [[Indo people|Indo]] (Eurasian) journalist and politician in the Dutch East Indies.

He was born in Batavia, Java, [[Dutch East Indies]], and also died there. He was the son of a Dutch father Pieter Jacobus Adrianus Zaalberg, Secretary at the Department of Education and Religious Affairs in the Dutch East Indies, and Indo (Eurasian) mother Susanna Elisabeth de Bie. He was married to Maria Taunay (born 1878) from 22 April 1899 up to her death in 1911. Both the Zaalberg and De Bie family were of [[Jewish]] descent.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} They had two sons and three daughters, one of whom died young.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.inghist.nl/Onderzoek/Projecten/BWN/lemmata/bwn6/zaalberg  ING (Institute for Dutch History) – Biography overview. P.1]&lt;/ref&gt;

Karel Zaalberg was a self-taught and self-made man. With only primary school he became chief editor of one of the biggest newspapers. Education for the Indo-Europeans of the Dutch East Indies would be his life's personal and political ambition. As a journalist he became a spokesman for the Indo-European ([[Eurasian (mixed ancestry)|Eurasian]]) community.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.inghist.nl/Onderzoek/Projecten/BWN/lemmata/bwn6/zaalberg  ING – Biography overview. P.1]&lt;/ref&gt;

He was director of the first organization for Indo-Europeans in the Dutch East Indies ('Indische Bond' of 1898). After 1919 he became a founder and board member of the Indo-European Alliance (Dutch: ‘[[Indo Europeesch Verbond]]'), with over 10,000 members the largest interest group of this population. From 1924 until his death, four years later, he represented the party in the Dutch East Indies [[Volksraad (Dutch East Indies)|People's Council]] ([[:nl:Volksraad (Nederlands-Indië)|Volksraad]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.inghist.nl/Onderzoek/Projecten/BWN/lemmata/bwn6/zaalberg  ING – Biography overview. P.1]&lt;/ref&gt;

Zaalberg was a leading figure in the political and social emancipation of the Indo (Eurasian) community of the Dutch East Indies of the late 19th and early 20th century, who had closely befriended famous figures of the time like writer [[Paulus Adrianus Daum|P.A. Daum]], [[Edgar du Perron|E.du Perron]] and independence activist [[Ernest Douwes Dekker]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nrcboeken.nl/biografie/woordvoerder-van-de-indo-europeanen-karel-zaalberg-1873-1928/  NRC (Dutch Newspaper) – Biography review by Locher-Scholten, E. P.1]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early years==
Due to a traffic accident his father became disabled and the impoverished family was unable to send their children to any form of higher or even secondary education. Young Zaalberg found a simple and low-ranking job at a big newspaper (copying addresses). It is there, however, where the intelligent Zaalberg learned the ropes of journalism, as well as English and French (by translating foreign newspaper articles and [[telegrams]]).

The editor in chief [[Paulus Adrianus Daum|P.A. Daum]], who was one of the most famous writers and journalists of the time, started to notice Zaalberg's talents and gave him more and more responsibilities. Daum, an [[autodidact]] himself, soon made Zaalberg his right-hand man, taking position against the widespread discrimination regarding Indos, who were seldom admitted to the highest layers of the colonial hierarchy. After Daum fell seriously ill Zaalberg replaced him successfully, but after the passing of his mentor the newspaper did not allow Zaalberg to replace him as editor in chief. The new chief editors failed miserably and the position remained vacant for a long time. Only after threatening to quit Zaalberg was appointed [[Editor in chief|Chief Editor]] of the '[[Bataviaasch Nieuwsblad]]'.&lt;ref&gt;Postma, Ulbe: ''Karel Zaalberg, journalist en strijder voor de Indo.'' (Publisher KITLV, Leiden, 1997.)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Politics==
Meanwhile, Zaalberg had also emerged himself into politics and became a champion of the interests of the Indo Eurasians. His attention was focused on the acquisition of civil rights, including the right of political association and the right to vote, for native-born (Indo-)Europeans as well as educated Javanese and Chinese. He also published several articles on the need of education for the native population and increasing involvement in the government of the archipelago.
The appointment of Ernest Douwes Dekker (an Indo like Zaalberg) as deputy editor in 1907 increased the political momentum of the 'Batavian Newspaper'. It had good contacts with young Javanese intellectuals and was actively involved in the formation of ‘Boedi Oetomo’ &lt;ref&gt;Original spelling, later changed to [[Budi Utomo]].&lt;/ref&gt; an event which is seen as the beginning of Indonesian nationalism. The close friendship between Douwes Dekker and Zaalberg initially led to joint plans with '[[Budi Utomo]]' to aim for a parliament representing all native communities, including the Indo Eurasians.

Even though Zaalberg was opposed to the colonial policy of the Netherlands, that in his opinion seemed ignorant to the inevitable struggle for emancipation of the Indonesian peoples, Zaalberg was not a radical revolutionary. His sharp and biting criticism was always framed in a [[positivist]] worldview, in which gradual and reasonable development, also with regard to the colonial relationship, remained paramount. Unlike Dekker who in the tradition of his famous ancestor, the writer of '[[Max Havelaar]]',&lt;ref&gt;[[Multatuli]] the alias of Eduard Douwes Dekker.&lt;/ref&gt; did not hesitate to taunt the authorities. This is also where the radical Dekker and the moderate Zaalberg fell out and went their separate ways.&lt;ref&gt;Postma, Ulbe: ''Karel Zaalberg, journalist en strijder voor de Indo.'' (Publisher KITLV, Leiden, 1997.)&lt;/ref&gt; Dekker went on to found the '[[Indische Party]]' in 1912 and Zaalberg the 'Indo Europeesch Vebond' in 1919.

==Final years==
After his breakup with Dekker, coinciding with a temporary decline of his journalistic career and the death of his beloved wife, his health started failing. He still however experienced his finest hour when he acted as chairman at the founding meeting of the Indo-European Alliance (Dutch: ‘[[Indo Europeesch Verbond]]') in 1919. As board member of the 'IEV' he became a representative in the Dutch East Indies 'Volksraad' (House of Assembly), an infant form of local parliament, where he remained highly vocal about the need for native educational facilities. At age 53 he succumbed to his health issues. Under the leadership of his successor [[Dick de Hoog]] his 'IEV' would become the single most important Indo movement in the Dutch East Indies, with close to 15,000 members.&lt;ref&gt;Willems, Wim '''Sporen van een Indisch verleden (1600–1942).''' (COMT, Leiden, 1994). Chapter II, P.75 {{ISBN|90-71042-44-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although he is widely acknowledged as one of the great leaders driving the [[emancipation]] of the Indo community in Dutch ruled colonial society, his personal dream of building a large educated political Indo cadre that could lead the East Indies to independence was never realised. In fact in the end his biggest fear came to be. After further detrimental marginalisation the vulnerable Indo community was squashed in the inevitable clash between Dutch colonialism and the Indonesian independence movement.&lt;ref&gt;Postma, Ulbe: ''Karel Zaalberg, journalist en strijder voor de Indo.'' (Publisher KITLV, Leiden, 1997.)&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Nihongo|'''Kutchan'''|倶知安町|Kutchan-chō}} is a [[List of towns in Japan|town]] located in [[Shiribeshi Subprefecture]], [[Hokkaido]], [[Japan]]. Kutchan lies slightly north of the volcano [[Mount Yōtei]], and is approximately 50 kilometers west of [[Sapporo]]. The subprefecture government offices are located in this town, making it the capital of the subprefecture.

As of April 30, 2017, the town has an estimated [[population]] of 15,573 and a [[population density]] of 60 persons per km².&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.town.kutchan.hokkaido.jp/index.jsp|title= Official website of Kutchan Town|publisher= Kutchan Town|location= Japan|language= Japanese|accessdate= 16 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The total area is {{convert|261.24|km2|abbr=on}}.

Throughout Hokkaido, Kutchan is known for its proximity to the world famous [[Niseko, Hokkaido|Niseko]] powder snow region and for its production of quality potatoes and potato products. Among these products, Kutchan is most famous for manufacturing ''gosetsu-udon'', a Japanese noodle made from [[flour#Other flours|potato flour]]. Jagata-kun, the skiing potato that is the cartoon mascot of Kutchan, indicates Kutchan's two most celebrated aspects. Jagata-kun roughly translates as, "little, fat potato boy".

==Geography==
*Located approximately {{convert|50|km|abbr=on}} west of Sapporo.  Kutchan lies in a valley surrounded by mountains, notably Niseko Annupuri and [[Mount Yōtei]].

Kutchan has the distinction of being one of the snowiest towns on earth with average annual snowfalls in excess of {{convert|10|m|ft|abbr=on}}. At only {{convert|176|m|ft|abbr=on}} above sea level the town receives greater amounts of snow than the world's leading ski areas such as Whistler, Aspen or Chamonix. Wintry weather lasts from early November through to early April with the snowiest month being January which averages {{convert|2.9|m|ft|abbr=on}}. January is also the coldest month averaging {{convert|-5.7|C|F|abbr=on}}.
Kutchan has 4 very distinct seasons with reasonably short spring and autumn periods. The summer is mild with temperatures rarely getting above {{convert|30|C|F|abbr=on}} and the humidity that afflicts much of Asia at this time is only felt for a short period, usually in August.

==History==
*Kutchan’s name comes from the [[Ainu language|language]] of the Hokkaido's native [[Ainu people]].  It attempts to mimic the pronunciation of the Ainu word ''ku-shan-i'' (which roughly translates as “the place where the channel flows”), but some claim that the name is derived from ''kucha-an-nai'' (“stream of a hunting lodge”).
*1892: Cultivation begins by colonizers from [[Tokushima Prefecture]] who had settled in nearby [[Yoichi, Hokkaido|Yoichi]].
*1893: The village of Kutchan is established.  It falls under the jurisdiction of the Abuta village town office (present-day [[Tōyako, Hokkaido|Tōyako]]).
*1896: The town office of Kutchan opens.
*1899: Changes jurisdiction from Muroran Subprefecture (present-day [[Iburi Subprefecture]]) to Iwanai Subprefecture.
*1906: Administered as a second-level municipality.
*1910: On February 8, [[Rusutsu, Hokkaido|Rusutsu]], [[Iwanai, Hokkaido|Iwanai]], and [[Otaru, Hokkaido|Otaru]]’s subprefectures were consolidated into [[Abuta District, Hokkaido|Abuta District]] of Muroran Subprefecture.  [[Shiribeshi Subprefecture]] is established in Kutchan.  On April 5, the satellite village of East Kutchan (present-day [[Kyōgoku, Hokkaido|Kyōgoku]]) is formed. Nisekoan, Higa, and the Fujizan area become part of the Shutai village administration zone (present-day [[Niseko, Hokkaido|Niseko]])
*1916: Administered as a town-level municipality
*1991: 100-year anniversary is celebrated.

==Economy==

===Hirafu===
Kutchan hosts the [[Hirafu]] skiing area.  Hirafu is commonly mistaken as a section of Niseko town since it is a part of the greater Niseko skiing region. However, to the financial benefit of Kutchan, Hirafu lies within the confines of Kutchan town. Hirafu's largest ski resort, [[Niseko Mt. Resort Grand Hirafu|Niseko Grand Hirafu]], draws the highest number of both domestic and foreign skiers and snowboarders than any other resort in the Niseko region. It is linked to the ski areas of Annupuri, Higashiyama, and Hanazono which together may be skied on one lift pass.

In recent years, {{When|date=August 2011}} an explosively high number of Australians have frequented Hirafu, many of whom have settled in the area and spawned businesses such as pensions, bars, and cafes.

Hirafu is also frequented by a considerable number of tourists from [[Hong Kong]], as well as tourists coming from within Japan.

Hirafu's expanding tourism industry is often attributed to the steady and copious supply of fresh powder snow, which many {{who|date=May 2012}} claim is among the best in the entire hemisphere, if not the world.

While Hirafu's economic boom is undoubtedly an asset to Kutchan town, many fear that such rapid development will alter the [[Marginal demand|price margin]] of goods and services offered in the village, and subsequently transform the local flavor of Hirafu.{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}} The local community of both Japanese and foreign "backpacker" skiers and snowboarders, who typically operate on a smaller budget than their upscale counterparts, are already being overshadowed by the burgeoning influx of wealthy tourists.{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}}

===Agriculture===
Along with short grain white rice, much of Kutchan’s surrounding area is devoted to potato cultivation.

==Culture==
As the main regional center of population, Kutchan hosts a variety of cultural institutions and events. The town is home to two museums, the Kutchan Natural History Museum and the Shu Ogawara Art Museum.  It also hosts the annual Mt. Niseko Kutchan Jazz Festival every July in the center of town, drawing thousands to enjoy the music of Japanese and Australian musicians.

===Jagata-kun===
{{Nihongo|Jagata-kun|じゃが太くん}} is Kutchan's mascot cartoon character. Due to the heavy snowfalls in the region, Kutchan hosts several alpine resorts frequented by domestic and international skiers and snowboarders. In the summer, Kutchan is best known for its primary agricultural product: potatoes. The town's two main industries (ski resorts and potato farming) are both reflected in Jagata-kun, a skiing potato.

Along with other prominent figures, including [[Hu Linyi]] and [[Guam Wing]], Ma raised the [[Green Standard Army]] to fight against the [[Taiping Rebellion]] and restore the stability of [[Qing Dynasty]]. This set the scene for the era later known as the "[[Tongzhi Restoration]]"（同治中兴. His [[assassination]] symbolized the serious conflict  between the [[Xiang Army]] and [[Green Standard Army]], both of which fought for the [[Qing Dynasty]].

==Early life==
Born as a native of [[Heze]], [[Shandong]] (荷澤) in 1821, he had successfully passed the imperial examinations at the age of 26 (1847), a prestigious achievement in China. He had earned the ''[[Jinshi (imperial examination)|Jinshi]]'' degree, the highest level in the civil service examinations, which led to his appointment to the [[Hanlin Academy]], a body of outstanding Chinese literary scholars who performed literary tasks for the imperial court.

==Assassination==
{{further|Assassination of Ma Xinyi}}
Ma Xinyi was later appointed as the governor-general of [[Viceroy of Liangjiang|Liangjiang]], a region comprising the provinces of [[Jiangxi]], [[Anhui]], and [[Jiangsu]] in 1868. He proved to be an able administrator, distinguishing himself with his capability to manage tensions with foreigners. This was demonstrated when Ma Xinyi addressed the problem of kidnapping in his area, which effectively averted anti-foreign riots, particularly in the area of the [[Yangtze River Delta|Yangzi]] delta.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Sold People: Traffickers and Family Life in North China|last=Ransmeier|first=Johanna|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=2017|isbn=9780674971974|location=Cambridge, MA|pages=68}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Two years later, in 1870, Ma Xinyi was assassinated and his killer was immediately caught. The assassin was identified as Wan Qingxuan (Zhang Wenxiang), who was executed in the marketplace after a trial presided by Wan Qingxuan of [[Nanchang]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The World of a Tiny Insect: A Memoir of the Taiping Rebellion and Its Aftermath|last=Daye|first=Zhang|publisher=University of Washington Press|year=2013|isbn=9780295993171|location=Seattle, WA|pages=115}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some sources state that he was the governor's former companion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=East Asian Cinema and Cultural Heritage: From China, Hong Kong, Taiwan to Japan and South Korea|last=Yau Shuk-ting|first=Kinnia|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|year=2011|isbn=9780230116955|location=New York|pages=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many historical rumours implicated the [[Empress Dowager Cixi]] in Ma Xinyi's death. This is aligned with the speculation that Ma Xinyi's assassination was due to the conflict between the imperial army and the Xiang militia, the group that played an important role in the suppression of the Taiping Rebellion.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Ultimate Fighting Championship===
Ankalaev made his promotional debut against [[Paul Craig (fighter)|Paul Craig]] in March 2018 at [[UFC Fight Night: Werdum vs. Volkov]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://karate.ru/news/2017-11-08/magomed-ankalaev-debyutiruet-v-ufc-v-marte/|title=Магомед Анкалаев дебютирует в UFC в марте на британской земле|website=karate.ru|language=ru|access-date=2018-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ankalaev dominated the fight for the better part of two rounds, winning with clean striking, takedowns and top control; Ankalaev even had Craig badly hurt with a body kick in the first round. However, in the last five seconds of round three, Craig caught Ankalaev with a triangle choke, giving him his first professional loss at exactly 4:59 of round three.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://mmajunkie.com/2018/03/ufc-fight-night-127-results-paul-craig-scores-miracle-submission-of-magomed-ankalaev-with-one-tick-left|title=UFC Fight Night 127 results: Paul Craig scores miracle submission of Magomed Ankalaev with one tick left|date=2018-03-17|work=MMAjunkie|access-date=2018-09-17|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4718">{{Gnosticism}} 
'''Marcus''' was the founder of the '''[[Marcosians|Marcosian]]''' [[Gnostic]] sect in the 2nd century AD. He was a disciple of [[Valentinus (Gnostic)|Valentinus]], with whom his system mainly agrees. His doctrines are almost exclusively known to us through a long polemic (i. 13–21) in ''[[On the Detection and Overthrow of the So-Called Gnosis|Adversus Haereses]]'', in which Irenaeus gives an account of his teaching and his school. [[Clement of Alexandria]] clearly knew of Marcus and actually used his number system (''[[Stromata]]'', VI, xvi), though without acknowledgement.

==Teachings==
{{Main|Marcosians}}
His system tells of 30 [[aeons]], divided into an Ogdoad, a Decad, and a Dodecad; of the fall and recovery of Sophia; of the future union of the spirits of the chosen seed with angels as their heavenly bridegrooms. What Marcus added to the teaching of his predecessors was a system of [[Isopsephy]] similar to that of the later [[Pythagoreans]], about [[Numerology|mysteries in numbers]] and names. Marcus found in Scripture and in Nature repeated examples of the occurrence of his mystical numbers, four, six, eight, ten, twelve, thirty.

==Life==
Marcus appears to have been an elder contemporary of Irenaeus, who speaks of him as though still living and teaching. Though we learn from Irenaeus that the [[Rhone]] district was a home to the followers of Marcus, it does not appear that Marcus was there himself, and the impression left is that Irenaeus knew the followers of Marcus by personal intercourse, Marcus only by his writings. We are told also of Marcus having seduced the wife of one of the deacons in [[Asia]] (διάκονον τινα τῶν ἐν τῇ Ἀσίᾳ), and the most natural conclusion is that [[Asia Minor]] was the scene where Marcus made himself a teacher, probably before Irenaeus had left that district; that it was a leading bishop there who resisted Marcus; and that his doctrines passed into [[Gaul]] by means of the extensive intercourse well known to have then prevailed between the two countries.

The use of [[Hebrew]] or [[Syriac language|Syriac]] names in the Marcosian school may lead us to ascribe to Marcus an Oriental origin. The only grounds, for believing him to be of [[Egypt]]ian extraction are these:—[[Sulpicius Severus]], and others who give the history of the origin of [[Priscillianism]], tell that one Marcus of Memphis brought the Gnostic doctrines into [[Spain]], from whom Agape and Elpidius learned them. [[Jerome]] certainly identified this Marcus with the subject of the present article, his notion bring that Marcosian doctrine, which we know from Irenaeus to have been prevalent in Southern [[Gaul]], naturally passed on to the adjacent province of Spain. It is not quite clear whether Jerome felt the chronological difficulties of his theory, which, however, could be easily got over by supposing that the first Priscillianists were to be regarded as having learned from Marcus, not because they had been taught by himself personally, but because they had learned from men who revered him as the founder of their sect. But since Priscillianism contains none of the points which distinguish Marcus from other Gnostics, it is safer to regard Marcus, of Memphis as a distinct personage.

==Accusations==
Irenaeus alleges that Marcus abused his influence over "silly women" in order to gain both money and sexual favors. He is accused of having used philtres and love charms, and at least one, if not more, of his female disciples on returning to the Church confessed that body as well as mind had been defiled by him. However, it seems that most of his followers claimed to have been elevated by their knowledge and the redemption they had experienced.

==Background==
Martin, a mixed blood Choctaw and Chickasaw Indian, was the son of Thomas Umphres Thompson (1829–1864) and Martha Strong Thompson (1836–1920)  (who were first cousins) was born in [[Rusk County, Texas]] on September 20, 1857. He married Inez Monterey Fannin at Camp Colorado, [[Coleman County, Texas]] on June 22, 1876. Inez who was born on May 15, 1860 at the [https://tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/bmm45 Mount Tabor Indian Community] in [[Rusk County, Texas]], was the daughter of William Moore Fannin (1833–1877) a mixed blood Choctaw, and Sarah Horton (1840–1928) who was also a mixed blood Indian of Choctaw, Chickasaw and Cherokee ancestry.

The couple made their homes near New London in Rusk County before relocating to the [[Chickasaw Nation]] in 1894.&lt;ref&gt;1896 Choctaw Census; Choctaws Residing in the Chickasaw Nation, Pickens County, IT&lt;/ref&gt; While living in the Chickasaw Nation, the couple lived in what is now rural [[Stephens County, Oklahoma]] near the community of Bray.&lt;ref&gt;1896 Choctaw Census; Choctaws Residing in the Chickasaw Nation, Pickens County, IT&lt;/ref&gt; Together the couple had eight children: Willie Newton (female), Althia, Decater Lee, Thomas Agatha (female), Clarence, Melissa Alavada, Cone Johnson and Mossie Brown. Martin died on August 25, 1946 in [[Jacksonville, Texas]]. He was preceded in death by his wife Inez on January 10, 1931 in [[Overton, Texas]].

==Mount Tabor Indian Community and the Chickasaw Nation==

Martin L. Thompson, who had been chosen the leader of the [[Choctaws]] at [https://tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/bmm45 Mount Tabor] in 1885, was passed over in favor of [[William Clyde Thompson]],&lt;ref&gt;Library of the University of Michigan, Department of the Interior, Laws, Decisions and Regulations Affecting the work of the Commissioner to the Five Civilized Tribes 1893-1906 pgs 130-138&lt;/ref&gt; to represent the [[Yowani Choctaw]] descendants in the [[Chickasaw Nation]], in their attempt to attain citizenship by blood in the [[Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma|Choctaw Nation]].&lt;ref&gt;William C. Thompson and the Choctaw-Chickasaw Paper Chase by Dr. Douglas Hale, Oklahoma State University&lt;/ref&gt; During the period of the [[Dawes Commission]] building of a Final Roll of the [[Five Civilized Tribes]] (1895–1907), Choctaw and Chickasaw Indians could live any place they close within the two nations. The reasons for this were many, but primarily the two tribes had been one not long before European contact. They spoke the same language, with some dialectal differences, and were culturally similar. In fact shortly after removal, the two tribes were united into one group for a short period of time. Those that did relocate to Indian Territory from east Texas settled in or near the town of [[Marlow, Oklahoma]] where William C. Thompson later served as Mayor. The lands that Martin Thompson settled was between Marlow and Bray in what is now [[Stephens County, Oklahoma]]. Although listed on the Choctaw Census as a "Choctaw Living in the Chickasaw Nation", Martin returned to Rusk County, Texas in 1896 before the close of the Dawes Roll and was therefore not entered onto the Final Roll.

Following his return to Texas he remained in a leadership position until his death. Although influential within the [[Mount Tabor Indian Community]], the larger organization, the Texas Cherokees and Associate Bands was led only by Cherokees both within the community and in the Cherokee Nation. Most Cherokees had left Rusk County between 1866 and 1900. While the overall leadership moved from [[William Penn Adair]]&lt;ref&gt;Cherokee Adairs, By Betty Barker and the Adair Reunion Committee; A family history recording the Adair family from Europe to the Cherokee Nation, 2003, ARC Press, {{ISBN|0-938041-97-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; until his death in Washington, D.C. in 1880, for a period it was again centered in Texas through [[John Martin Thompson]].&lt;ref&gt;Handbook of Texas Online: John Martin Thompson https://tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/fth43 (accessed September 3, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt; With his death in 1907, the Executive Committee of the Texas Cherokees and Associate Bands was shifted back to the Cherokee Nation with Claude Muskrat as Chairman.&lt;ref&gt;George Fields Collection, Gilcrease Museum, Tulsa, Oklahoma&lt;/ref&gt; He was succeeded by [[W.W. Keeler]] who was later to serve as Principal Chief of the Cherokee Nation.

With the resignation of Keeler in &lt;ref&gt;Texas-Cherokees vs United States Docket 26, 26 Ind Cl Comm. 78 (1971)&lt;/ref&gt; 1972 and the adoption of a constitution for the Cherokee Nation of Oklahoma in 1975, the Texas Cherokee Executive Committee was again led by Texans. Judge Foster T. Bean replaced Keeler and remained in that capacity until 1988. Judge Bean was succeeded by J.C. Thompson as Chairman, serving from 1988-1998 and again from 2001-2018. J.C. Thompson being the great great nephew of Martin L. Thompson.

==Later life==
For Martin L. Thompson, family, ranching and oil would consume the remainder of his life.&lt;ref&gt;Dallas Morning News, Sunday, March 8, 1940, "Owns Prerevolutionary Bible"&lt;/ref&gt; His only other claim to fame was his conflict with George Fields,&lt;ref&gt;Chief Bowles and Texas Cherokees, Chapter XI, Cherokee Claims to Land, By Mary Whatley Clarke, University of Oklahoma Press, {{ISBN|0806134364}}, {{ISBN|978-0806134369}}&lt;/ref&gt; attorney for the Texas Cherokees and Associate Bands in the 1920s. The issue was over inclusion of the Choctaws in litigation related to the Treaty of Bowles Village in 1839. From this conflict, the word Choctaw was scratched off the documents that were to be a part of the brief submitted to the [[United States Supreme Court]] in 1921.

Oil was discovered on his land and by the time of his death he was one of the wealthiest Choctaw-Chickasaws in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;LWT Martin L. Thompson, Smith County Probate 1946&lt;/ref&gt; From this start many of his descendants went on to prosperous lives as doctors, attorneys, ranchers and teachers. His family today remains active as citizens of the Mount Tabor Indian Community with his grandson Ras Pool serving as Deputy Chairman from 2000 until his passing in 2015.

The campaign spanned several years and became a nationwide community effort sustained by Tinsley's articles in The Irish Times about lack of facilities, the deaths of her friends and the stories and energy of people with CF and their families and communities around Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|subscription= yes |via=[[HighBeam Research]] |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-164048275.html |title=When people are dying for Ireland.(COMMENT) |first=Gene |last=Kerrigan |authorlink=Gene Kerrigan |date=27 May 2007 |accessdate=9 November 2015 |work=[[Sunday Independent (Ireland)|Sunday Independent]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2008 for her work she was named ''[[Young Person of the Year|Rehab Young Person of the Year]]''&lt;ref name="YPOTY"&gt;http://www.peopleoftheyear.com/Gallery/Video/2008-Videos/Orla-Tinsley-named-as-Joint-Young-Person-of-the-Ye.asporla&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2009 she appeared on ''[[The Late Late Show (Ireland)|Late Late Show]]'' after writing several pieces in ''The Irish Times holding government to account on broken promises to build an adult cystic fibrosis unit in [[Dublin]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rte.ie/tv/latelate/20090403.html&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2009 she began an internship in The Irish Times. That same year the promised government funding for the cystic fibrosis unit was pulled and the campaign reprised. Several campaigners from the previous had died. Ms Tinsley and other new campaigners featured on RTE Liveline Show which played an important role in the campaign. Tinsley was named Irish Tatler Magazine's ''Woman of the Year'' &lt;ref name="tatler"&gt;http://www.irishtimes.com/news/woman-of-year-cystic-fibrosis-campaigner-honoured-1.771509&lt;/ref&gt; in 2009. In 2010 she was awarded the ''Young Medical Journalist of the Year'' award.

== Documentary ==

In April 2011 Ms Tinsley presented a special documentary for [[Raidió Teilifís Éireann|RTÉ]]'s [[Flagship (broadcasting)|flagship]] [[Current affairs (news format)|current affairs]] programme ''Prime Time'' to apply pressure for building to begin at St Vincent's Hospital in Dublin.&lt;ref "name=primetime"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/primetime/2011/0412/299783-12april2011_primetime/ |archivedate=28 May 2011 |date=12 April 2011 |title=Prime Time – 12th April 2011 (VIDEO) |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150528031352/http://www.rte.ie/news/primetime/2011/0412/299783-12april2011_primetime/ |deadurl=no |publisher=[[Raidió Teilifís Éireann]] |accessdate=9 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Memoir ==

In September 2011 her best-selling memoir ''Salty Baby : A memoir'' was published by [[Hachette (publisher)|Hachette]]. It was shortlisted for Best Newcomer at the [[Irish Book Awards|Bórd Gáis Irish Book Awards]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rte.ie/tv/latelate/20110916.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Adult Cystic Fibrosis Unit ==

An Adult Cystic Fibrosis practice was set up at St. Vincent's Hospital in the late 1970s by Professor MX Fitzgerald. CF was one of the first conditions to be treated by a multidisciplinary team comprising doctors, dietitians, physiotherapists, psychologists and nurse specialists. Huge improvements in life expectancy were achieved in this period but when advances in microbial genetics revealed how highly-resistant and life-threatening bacteria could spread through the CF patient population, it became clear that a dedicated space was required to treat CF patients in isolation from one another. There was no dedicated CF ward at this time and it took years to convince those in power to build one. In July 2012, after campaign work over numerous years, a dedicated Cystic Fibrosis Unit opened.&lt;ref name="unit"&gt;{{cite web| date=30 July 2012 |accessdate=9 November 2015 |publisher=[[RTÉ News]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151109115941/http://www.rte.ie/news/2012/0730/331221-cystic-fibrosis-st-vincents-nutley-wing/ |url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2012/0730/331221-cystic-fibrosis-st-vincents-nutley-wing/ |deadurl=no |title=Cystic fibrosis patients transferred to new €22m facility at St Vincent's | archivedate=9 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ward block has an outpatient and inpatient facility for people with cystic fibrosis.&lt;ref name="unit"/&gt; It also has a floor of isolation rooms for people with cancer and another floor for those with infectious diseases who need isolation.&lt;ref name="unit"/&gt;

Similar units have opened in [[Cork University Hospital]] and [[University Hospital Limerick]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.eveningecho.ie/cork-news/cystic-fribosis-unit-to-finally-open-at-cuh-after-months-of-delay/1123211/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.clare.fm/news/new-adult-cystic-fibrosis-unit-be-opened-regions-main-hospital-today&lt;/ref&gt;

== Transgender rights ==

Since 2012 Ms Tinsley has focused on the rights of [[transgender]] people to attain gender recognition in Ireland. She was named ''Broadcaster / Journalist of the Year by the Gay and Lesbian Association'' in 2013.&lt;ref name="BJOTY"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.queerid.com/topic.aspx?topicid=34000 |title=Galas 2013 Winners |publisher=Queerid |date=28 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== New Cystic fibrosis Drug ==

In late 2012 she launched a campaign to get [[Kalydeco]] into Ireland after experts rejected making the drug available because it was too expensive. The drug is the first to treat the cause of cystic fibrosis and not just the symptoms.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rte.ie/news/player/2013/0201/3479561-cf-campaigner-orla-tinsley-discusses-the-approval-of-new-cf-drug/&lt;/ref&gt;
In February 2013 the Minister for Health announced that the drug would be made available.&lt;ref&gt;http://health.gov.ie/blog/press-release/new-cystic-fibrosis-drug-ivacaftor-kalydeco-to-be-made-available-for-irish-patients/&lt;/ref&gt;

Since late 2013 Ms Tinsley is one of the first people in the world to be treated by the second new cystic fibrosis drug [[lumacaftor/ivacaftor]] which treats the most common mutation of CF. The drug has proven to improve lung function and health for people with CF.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Columbia University ==

In 2014 Ms Tinsley announced on the Irish talk-show ''[[Saturday Night with Miriam]]'' that she had been awarded a scholarship to [[Columbia University]]. 
She now lives in New York City.

==Double lung transplant==
Tinsley received a [[double lung transplant]] in December 2017.&lt;ref name="transplant"&gt;{{cite news |work=[[the Irish Times]] |accessdate=22 December 2017 |first1=Aine |last1=McMahon |first2=Sorcha |last2=Pollak |url=https://www.irishtimes.com/news/health/orla-tinsley-in-recovery-after-double-lung-transplant-1.3334969 |title=Orla Tinsley in recovery after double lung transplant

'''Robert Camuto''' (born February 4, 1958) is an American journalist and author specializing in wine culture and epicurean travel writing.

==Biography==
Camuto was born in New York City.  He graduated from the [[University of Michigan]] Residential College in Ann Arbor in 1979 and received a master's degree in Journalism from the Columbia University School of Journalism in 1984. His father is footwear designer [[Vince Camuto]]. 
He has lived in France with his wife, Gilda, since 2001. The couple has one son.

==Career Timeline==
Camuto began working as a freelance writer in San Francisco in 1979, where he wrote about music and culture for newspapers and other publications including the short-lived New Wave magazine [https://web.archive.org/web/20061027050842/http://www.rip-her-to-shreds.com/archive_press_magazines_boulevardsfeb81.php Boulevards].

''Texas Years''&lt;br&gt;
After graduating from Columbia, Camuto worked as a reporter and editor in Texas, working for the [[Dallas Times Herald]] and the [[Fort Worth Star-Telegram]].  In 1996, he founded and published the award-winning alternative newsweekly [[Fort Worth Weekly]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Fort Worth Weekly]]&lt;/ref&gt;  After selling the weekly in 2000 to [[New Times Media]],&lt;ref&gt;
http://business.highbeam.com/3563/article-1G1-64083159/national-publisher-agrees-buy-fort-worth-texas-weekly&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.altweeklies.com/aan/fw-weekly-sold-to-new-times-inc/Article?oid=1078&lt;/ref&gt; he moved to France with his French-born wife and their Texas-born son.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;''France and Books on Wine Terroirs''&lt;br&gt;
Since his move overseas, Camuto has contributed travel and epicurean articles for the [https://www.washingtonpost.com/?reload=true Washington Post],[http://www.winespectator.com/ Wine Spectator],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.winespectator.com/author/index/id/344&lt;/ref&gt;[http://www.foodandwine.com/ Food &amp; Wine], [http://lacucinaitalianamagazine.com/ Cucina Italiana], [http://www.newsday.com/ Newsday] and the [http://www.smh.com.au/ Sydney Morning Herald] among others. In 2013, Camuto was named a contributing editor at Wine Spectator.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.winespectator.com/author/show/id/344&lt;/ref&gt;

Camuto’s first book,[http://robertcamuto.net/?q=node/6 Corkscrewed: Adventures in the New French Wine Country] describes a pilgrimage through French wine country and was published in 2008 (University of Nebraska Press)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.journalism.columbia.edu/system/documents/200/original/09_Winter.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-11-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140114200903/http://www.journalism.columbia.edu/system/documents/200/original/09_Winter.pdf |archivedate=2014-01-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; to critical acclaim. The story is of a new generation of French regional winemakers striving to preserve endangered traditions, reconnect with nature, and produce quality wines on what are oftentimes little known terroirs.  In 2009 the book was translated into French (Editions Michel Lafon) under the title [http://robertcamuto.net/?q=node/275 Un American dans les vignes: Une ode amoureuse a la France de bien vivre] and it has won two distinguished literary awards: the 2009 Prix du clos de Vougeot and the 2010 Prix Jean Carmet des Vins de Bourgueil.&lt;ref&gt;
http://www.prix-litteraires.net/detail_prix_auteur.php?auteur=4090_Robert_V_Camuto&lt;/ref&gt;
Camuto’s second book, [http://robertcamuto.net/?q=node/329 Palmento: A Sicilian Wine Odyssey] is an exploration of Sicily, from its cuisines to its history, mores, culture, and antimafia movement.  The narrative is explored through the lens of the winemakers and the wine they create in the region.  Published in 2010, the New York Times wine critic [http://dinersjournal.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/03/16/a-bit-formal-but-he-loosens-up-over-dinner/ Eric Asimov] called it a "beautiful, enthralling work."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nebraskapress.unl.edu/product/Palmento,674633.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2011, Camuto was hired as the main project contributor for the [http://www.allbookstores.com/Michelin-Green-Guide-Sicily-Michelin/9781907099670 Michelin Green Guide Sicily](2012).

'''Samuel Untermyer''' (March 6, 1858 – March 16, 1940, although some sources cite March 2, 1858,&lt;ref name="Samuel Untermyer"&gt;{{cite EB1922 |wstitle=Untermyer, Samuel |volume=32 |pages=901–02}}&lt;/ref&gt; and even others, June 6, 1858&lt;ref&gt;"Current Biography", 1940, p.&amp;nbsp;819.&lt;/ref&gt;) was a prominent American [[lawyer]] and civic leader. He is also remembered for bequeathing his [[Yonkers, New York]] estate, now known as [[Untermyer Park]], to the people of [[New York State]].

==Life==

Samuel Untermyer was born in [[Lynchburg, Virginia]] but after the death of his father the rest of the family moved to [[New York City]]. He was educated at the College of the City of New York and received his LL.B. from [[Columbia Law School]] in 1878.&lt;ref name="Samuel Untermyer"/&gt;

Untermyer was admitted to the bar, and started practicing in New York city. His younger brother, Maurice Untermyer, was later admitted, and then in 1895 [[Louis Marshall]] joined the firm. They, with [[Randolph Guggenheimer]], practiced as Guggenheimer, Untermyer &amp; Marshall for 45 years.{{cn|date=February 2018}}

Untermyer gained fame as a lawyer focusing on [[corporate law]]. He became an advocate of [[stock market]] regulations, government ownership of [[Rail transport|railroads]], and various legal reforms. He was also a prominent Zionist leader and the first attorney to earn a million dollars on a single case.{{cn|date=February 2018}} In addition, Untermyer served as chairman of the board that framed America's income tax and excess profits laws during World War I. &lt;ref&gt;G. &amp; C. Merriam Co, Webster's Biographical Dictionary at p. 1501 (1964).&lt;/ref&gt;

Untermyer frequently attended the [[Democratic National Convention]] as a delegate. As an active Zionist, Untermyer was also an advocate for the Zionist liberation movement, and was President of the [[Keren Hayesod]], the agency through which the movement was conducted in America.&lt;ref name="Samuel Untermyer"/&gt;

Untermyer is well-remembered for donating his home to the people of [[Yonkers]], [[New York (state)|New York]]. The property is now known as [[Untermyer Park]].

==Legacy==
[[File:Samuel Untermyer Tomb (Interior).jpg|thumb|left|Interior of Samuel Untermyer's tomb at Woodlawn Cemetery, Bronx NY]] Between the start of his practice and the end of 1921, Untermyer was counsel in many celebrated cases, specifically:&lt;ref name="Samuel Untermyer"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.infoplease.com/ce6/people/A0850123.html |title=Samuel Untermyer |accessdate=2007-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Morgan]]'s replies to Untermyer at the [[Pujo Committee]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XZqVCv435J8C&amp;pg=PA93#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=J. Pierpont Morgan: Industrialist and Financier|author=Michael Burgan|page=93|date=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
* As counsel for H. Clay Pierce he prevented the [[Standard Oil]] Co., after its dissolution in 1910, from dominating the Waters-Pierce Co.
* In the same year he effected the merger of the [[Kennecott Utah Copper|Utah Copper]] Co. with the Boston Consolidated and the Nevada Consolidated Co.'s involving more than $100,000,000.
* In 1912, as counsel to the Kaliwerke Aschersleben and the Disconte Gesellschaft in the controversy arising out of the control of the [[potash]] industry by the [[Germany|German]] Government, he assisted in reaching a settlement.
* In 1903 he undertook the first judicial exposure of "high finance" in connection with the failure of the U.S. Shipbuilding Co., organized only a year before as a consolidation of the larger shipbuilding companies in America including that subsequently known as the Bethlehem Steel Co. As a result of the sensational exposures connected with that company, a reorganization was effected under the name of the [[Bethlehem Steel]] Co., in which Untermyer became a large shareholder.
* After this he conducted a number of similar exposures. In 1911 he delivered an address entitled, "Is There a Money Trust?" which led the following year to an investigation by the Committee on Banking and Currency of the U.S. House of Representatives headed by [[Arsène Pujo]]. Untermyer was counsel to the Committee and famously cross-examined J.P. Morgan and other New York bankers. This so-called [[Pujo Committee|Pujo Money Trust Investigation]] resulted in the passage of remedial legislation, including the establishment of the Federal Reserve System.
* Untermyer for years agitated before [[United States Congress|Congress]] and state legislatures such measures as the compulsory regulation of stock exchanges.
* He for many years conducted agitations and wrote magazine articles dealing with reforms in the criminal laws, the regulation of [[trusts]] and combinations and other [[economic]] subjects.
* He was counsel for many reorganization committees, including those of the Seaboard Air Line, the Rock Island railway, the Central Fuel Oil Co., and the Southern Iron and Steel Co.
* In 1915 he acted as a counsel for the U.S. Government in the suit brought against the Secretary of the Treasury and the Comptroller of the Currency by the Riggs National Bank of Washington, D.C., which charged there was a conspiracy to wreck it; the defendants were cleared.
* He took an active part in preparing the [[Federal Reserve Bank]] law, the Clayton bill, the Federal Trade Commission bill, and other legislation curbing trusts.
* He was a delegate to the [[Democratic National Convention]] in 1904, 1908, 1912, and delegate-at-large for the state of New York in 1916.
* He was a strong supporter of [[Woodrow Wilson|President Wilson]]'s administration.
* After America entered the Great War he was adviser to the [[U.S. Treasury Department]] regarding the interpretation of the [[income tax]] and the excess profits tax laws.
* He was appointed by President Wilson to serve on the U.S. section of the International High Commission, which sat at Buenos Aires in 1916, for the purpose of framing uniform laws for the PanAmerican countries.

* In 1920 he was counsel for the [[Charles C. Lockwood#Lockwood Committee|Lockwood Committee]], appointed by the state Legislature to investigate an alleged conspiracy among the building trades of New York City. It was charged that labor leaders were using their power by extorting bribes for the prevention of [[Strike action|strikes]], by preventing independent bids and by forcing building awards to favorites. Many illegal acts were disclosed and numerous convictions secured. Robert P. Brindell, who was at the head of the labor council of the building trades with a membership of 115,000 was prosecuted by Untermyer, who conducted the case in person as a special attorney-general, and convicted of extortion and sentenced to five-to-ten years in state [[prison]]. At the end of 1921, when the prosecutions were being continued, more than 600 indictments had been found as a result of the investigation and many more were said to be pending. There were more than 200 convictions including pleas of guilty by employers, labor leaders and others and over $500,000 had been collected in fines. In connection with the exposure of abuses and acts of illegality among the [[labour unions]], all unions in the state were required, under the threat of criminal prosecution and of submitting to incorporation, to amend their constitutions and bylaws by eliminating these abuses; this they all agreed to do. It was shown that in many of the building trades both manufacturers and dealers, often with the collusive aid of labour leaders, had organized to fix prices and prevent competition. Subsequent prosecutions established the fact that these and other unfair practices were an important element in preventing building operations and increasing rental charges for dwelling property. Public opinion, especially in view of the housing shortage, reacted sharply to these revelations, and it was felt that Untermyer's work in this connection had been performed with admirable public spirit, energy and courage. It was generally believed, moreover, that the evils brought to light by the committee were not confined to New York, and a demand for similar investigations arose in other parts of the country.
* As special counsel until 1933 in the New York City transit suits, he helped maintain the five-cent subway fare.

Untermyer was a staunch advocate of [[stock market]] regulations, government ownership of [[Rail transport|railroads]], and various legal reforms.

==Political involvement==
Untermyer was a delegate to [[Democratic National Convention]] from New York in 1904, 1908, 1912, 1916, 1932, and 1936. He was also a delegate to the New York state constitutional convention in 1938.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://politicalgraveyard.com/bio/unger-upfold.html |title=Untermyer Political Graveyard entry |accessdate=2007-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Untermyer also advocated the Zionist movement and was President of the [[Keren Hayesod]], the agency through which the movement was then and still is conducted in America.&lt;ref name="Samuel Untermyer"/&gt;

In 1933, he helped found the [[Non-Sectarian Anti-Nazi League]] to promote an economic boycott of Nazi Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Hawkins |first=Richard A. |title=The internal politics of the Non-Sectarian Anti-Nazi League to Champion Human Rights, 1933–1939 |url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1744935910361642 |journal=Management &amp; Organizational History |volume=5 |issue=2 |pages=251–78 |doi=10.1177/1744935910361642}}{{Citation |url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1744935910361642 |title=Management &amp; Organizational History |last=Hawkins |first=Richard A. |volume=5 |pages=251–278 |doi=10.1177/1744935910361642}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Untermyer Park==
{{Main article|Untermyer Park}}
[[File:Garden in Untermyer Park, Yonkers, NY.JPG|thumb|Part of [[Untermyer Park]], the former estate of Samuel Untermyer]]
Untermyer developed elaborate gardens at his 150-acre riverside estate "Greystone", in [[Yonkers, New York]], on land adjacent to the [[Hudson River]].&lt;ref&gt;Hawkins, Richard. "Samuel Untermyer." In ''Immigrant Entrepreneurship: German-American Business Biographies, 1720 to the Present'', vol. 2, edited by William J. Hausman. German Historical Institute. Last modified November 12, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;
Greystone had previously been owned by defeated Presidential candidate [[Samuel Tilden]], and was purchased by Untermyer when Tilden died in 1886.
When Untermyer himself died in 1940, his plan had been to donate the whole estate to the Nation, or the State of New York, or at least to the City of Yonkers.
Eventually the city of Yonkers agreed to accept part of the estate gardens; this parcel of land was renamed [[Untermyer Park]] in his honor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.backyardgardener.com/ginsburg/column175.html |title=Untermyer park |accessdate=2007-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was added to the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1974.&lt;ref name="nris"&gt;{{NRISref|version=2009a}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Untermyer was born in [[Lynchburg, Virginia]] on March 6, 1858 to Isadore Untermyer and Therese Laudauer, both of whom were German [[Jew]]s who emigrated to the United States from Bavaria. His father, who had been a lieutenant in the [[Confederate Army]], died in 1866. The family then moved to [[New York City]].

[[File:Gravesite of Samuel Untermeyer.JPG|thumb|right|Gravesite of Samuel Untermyer, [[Woodlawn Cemetery (Bronx)|Woodlawn Cemetery]]]]
On August 9, 1880 he married Minnie Carl, daughter of Mairelius Carl of New York City. They had three children, Alvin, who served in the 305th Field Artillery in France during the [[World War I|Great War]]; [[Irwin Untermyer]], a justice of the [[Appellate Division of the New York Supreme Court, First Judicial Department]], and Irene, a philanthropist who married Louis Putnam Myers and, after his death, became the wife of Stanley Richter.  Upon the outbreak of World War I, Untermyer, his wife, and two servants were vacationing in Carlsbad, Germany, and returned to the United States aboard the ''Baltic'' via London in late August.&lt;ref&gt;"Baltic Brings 1,500 American Refugees Home," ''Syracuse Herald'', Aug. 23, 1914.&lt;/ref&gt;

Untermyer died March 16, 1940, in [[Palm Springs, California]]. His body was interred at a family plot that he established in [[Woodlawn Cemetery, Bronx|Woodlawn Cemetery]], [[Bronx, New York]], which features sculpture by [[Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney]].&lt;ref&gt;{{FAG|6935954}}&lt;!-- Page has photos of the Untermyer Memorial --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; His obituary was published in the ''New York Times'' (March 17, 1940, p.&amp;nbsp;1).

[[Count]] '''Sergei Yulyevich Witte''' ({{lang-ru|Серге́й Ю́льевич Ви́тте|translit='''Vitte'''}}, {{IPA-ru|vitɛ|pron}})&lt;ref&gt;F.L. Ageenko and M.V. Zarva, ''Slovar' udarenii'' (Moscow: Russkii yazyk, 1984), p. 547.&lt;/ref&gt; ({{OldStyleDate|29 June|1849|17 June}} &lt;!--9 August 1849?--&gt;{{spaced ndash}}{{OldStyleDate|13&amp;nbsp;March|1915|28 February}}), also known as '''Sergius Witte''', was a highly influential [[econometrician]], minister, and prime minister in [[Imperial Russia]], one of the key figures in the political arena at the end of 19th and at the beginning of the 20th century.&lt;ref name="russiapedia.rt.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://russiapedia.rt.com/prominent-russians/politics-and-society/sergei-witte/|title=Sergei Witte – Russiapedia Politics and society Prominent Russians|website=russiapedia.rt.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Witte was neither a liberal or a conservative. He attracted foreign capital to boost Russia's industrialization. Witte served under the last two emperors of Russia, [[Alexander III of Russia|Alexander III]] and [[Nicholas II of Russia|Nicholas II]].&lt;ref name="twilightxiii"&gt;Harcave, Sidney. (2004). [https://books.google.com/books?id=kTswgGNBFBAC&amp;pg=PR13&amp;dq=sergei+witte+harcave&amp;lr=&amp;sig=ACfU3U1Yw2sZ22JAVIRrW99QKn1sbDzsuQ#PPR13,M1 ''Count Sergei Witte and the Twilight of Imperial Russia: A Biography,'' p. xiii.]&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Russo-Turkish War (1877–78)]] he had risen to a position in which he controlled all the traffic passing to the front along the lines of the [[Odessa Railways]]. As Minister of Finance Witte presided over extensive [[industrialization]] and the management of various railroad lines. He framed the [[October Manifesto]] of 1905, and the accompanying government communication, but was not convinced it would solve Russia's problem with the [[Tsarist autocracy]].

On 20 October 1905 he became the first Chairman of the [[Council of Ministers of Russia|Russian Council of Ministers]] ([[Prime Minister of Russia|Prime Minister]]). Assisted by his Council he designed Russia's first [[Russian Constitution of 1906|constitution]]. Within a few months he fell into disgrace within court circles as a reformer. He resigned before the [[State Duma (Russian Empire)#First Duma|First Duma]] assembled. Witte was fully confident that he had resolved the main problem—providing political stability to the regime,&lt;ref name="russiapedia.rt.com"/&gt; but according to him the "peasant problem" would further determine the character of the Duma's activity.&lt;ref&gt;Witte's Memoirs, p. 359&lt;/ref&gt;

He has been described as the 'great reforming finance minister of the 1890s',&lt;ref name="fig41"&gt;Figes, p. 41&lt;/ref&gt; 'one of Nicholas's most enlightened ministers',&lt;ref name="fig8"&gt;Figes, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; and the architect of Russia's new parliamentary order in 1905.&lt;ref name="fig217"&gt;Figes, p. 217&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family and early life==
Witte's father Christoph Heinrich Georg Julius Witte descended from a [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] Baltic family of Dutch origin&lt;ref&gt;His ancestors lived in [[Jaunjelgava|Friedrichstadt]] in [[Courland Governorate|Courland]] and not in [[Holstein]].[https://www.geni.com/people/Johann-Witte/6000000030184775133]&lt;/ref&gt; and converted to [[Russian Orthodox Church|Russian Orthodoxy]] upon marriage with Yekaterina Fadeyeva. He became a member of the knighthood in &lt;!--the second largest city of the Russian Empire,--&gt; [[Pskov]], but moved to [[Saratov]] and [[Tbilisi|Tiflis]] &lt;!--[[Tiflis Governorate]] (present-day Tbilisi, [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]])--&gt; as a civil servant. Sergei was raised on the estate of his mother's parents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://russiapedia.rt.com/prominent-russians/politics-and-society/sergei-witte/|title=Sergei Witte – Russiapedia Politics and society Prominent Russians|website=russiapedia.rt.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; His grandfather was Andrei Mikhailovich Fadeyev, a Governor of [[Saratov]] and Privy Councillor of the [[Caucasus]], his grandmother was [[Princess Helene Dolgoruki]]. Sergei had two brothers (Alexander and Boris) and two sisters (Olga and Sophia),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.peoples.ru/state/politics/vitte/|title=История России в портретах. В 2-х тт.

He entered a Tiflis gymnasium, but he took more interest in music, fencing and riding than in studying. Sergei finished Gymnasium I in [[Chişinău|Kishinev]]&lt;ref&gt;{{ru icon}} [http://www.kto-is-kto.ru/?page=person_detail&amp;person=540 Kto-is-kto.ru ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090710195205/http://www.kto-is-kto.ru/?page=person_detail&amp;person=540 |date=2009-07-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and commenced studying Physico-Mathematical Sciences at the [[Odessa University|Novorossiysk University]] in [[Odessa]] in 1866 graduating top of his class in 1870.&lt;ref name="twilightxiv"&gt;Harcave, [https://books.google.com/books?id=kTswgGNBFBAC&amp;lpg=PR13&amp;dq=sergei%20witte%20harcave&amp;lr&amp;pg=PA33#v=onepage&amp;q=sergei%20witte%20harcave&amp;f=false,M1 p. 33.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Witte had initially planned to pursue a career in academia with the aim of becoming a professor in Theoretical   Mathematics. His relatives took a dim view of this career path as it was considered unsuitable for a noble at the time. He was instead persuaded by Count Vladimir Alekseyevich Bobrinsk, then Minister of Ways and Communication, to pursue a career in the [[History of rail transport in Russia|railroads]]. At the direction of the Count, Witte undertook six months of on the job training in a variety of positions on the [[Odessa Railways]] in order to gain a practical understanding of [[Ukrainian Railways]] operations. At the end of this period he was appointed chief of the traffic office.&lt;ref name="twilightxv"&gt;Harcave, [https://books.google.com/books?id=kTswgGNBFBAC&amp;lpg=PR13&amp;dq=sergei%20witte%20harcave&amp;lr&amp;pg=PA42#v=onepage&amp;q=sergei%20witte%20harcave&amp;f=false,M1 p. 42.]&lt;/ref&gt;

After a wreck on the Odessa Railways in late 1875 cost many lives, Witte was arrested and sentenced to four months in prison. However, while still contesting the case in court, Witte's Odessa Railways made such extraordinary efforts towards the transport of troops and war materials in the [[Russo-Turkish War (1877-1878)|Russo-Turkish War]]—he devised a novel system of double-shift working to overcome delays on the line&lt;ref name="britannica.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Sergey-Yulyevich-Graf-Witte|title=Sergey Yulyevich, Count Witte - prime minister of Russia|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;—that he attracted the attention of Grand Duke [[Grand Duke Nicholas Nikolaevich of Russia (1831–1891)|Nikolai Nikolaevich]], who commuted his term to two weeks.

In 1879, Witte accepted a post in [[St. Petersburg]], where he met his future wife. He moved to [[Kiev]] the following year. In 1883, he published a paper on "Principles of railway tariffs for cargo transportation", in which he also spoke out on social issues and the role of the monarchy. Witte gained popularity. In 1886, he was appointed manager of the privately held [[Southwestern Railways]], based in Kiev, and was noted for increasing its efficiency and profitability. Around this time, he met Tsar [[Alexander III of Russia|Alexander III]], but came into conflict with the Tsar's aides when he warned of the danger in using two powerful freight locomotives to achieve high speeds for the Royal Train. His warnings were proven in the October 1888 [[Borki train disaster]], which resulted in the appointment of Witte to the position of Director of State Railways.

==Political career==

===Minister of Finance===

Witte worked in railroad management for twenty years, starting out as a ticket clerk.&lt;ref name="fig41"/&gt; He served as Russian Director of Railway Affairs within the Finance Ministry from 1889 to 1891; and during this period, he oversaw an ambitious program of railway construction. Until then less than one-fourth of the small railway systems was under direct state control; but Witte set about making the railway service a monopoly of the State. Witte also obtained the right to assign employees based on their performance, rather than political or familial connections. In 1889, he published a paper titled "National Savings and Friedrich List", which cited the economic theories of [[Friedrich List]] and justified the need for a strong domestic industry, protected from foreign competition by [[trade barrier|customs barriers]]. This resulted in a new customs law for Russia in 1891, which spurred an increase in industrialization in Russia towards the turn of the century.

Tsar Alexander III appointed him acting Minister of Ways and Communications in 1892.&lt;ref name="twilightxiv"/&gt; This gave him control of the railroads in Russia and the authority to impose a reform on the tariffs charged. "Russian railroads gradually became perhaps the most economically operated railroads of the world.".&lt;ref name="Boublikoff, p. 313"&gt;Boublikoff, p. 313&lt;/ref&gt;  Profits were high: over 100 million gold rubles a year to the government (exact amount unknown due to accounting defects). In 1892 Witte became acquainted with Matilda Ivanovna (Isaakovna) Lisanevich in a theater.&lt;ref name="peoples.ru"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.peoples.ru/state/politics/vitte/|title=История России в портретах. В 2-х тт. Т.1. с.285-308 Сергей Витте|website=www.peoples.ru}}&lt;/ref&gt; Witte began to seek her favour, urging her to divorce her gambling  husband and marry him. The marriage was a scandal, not only because Matilda was a divorcee, but also because she was a converted Jew. It cost Witte many of his connections with the upper nobility, but the Tsar protected him.

In August 1892, Witte was appointed to the post of Minister of Finance, a post which he held for the next eleven years. (Until 1905 matters pertaining to industry and commerce were within the province of the Ministry of Finances.) During his tenure, he greatly accelerated the construction of the [[Trans-Siberian Railway]]. He also paid much attention to the creation of an educational system to train personnel for industry, in particular, the creation of new "commercial" schools, and was known for his appointment of subordinates by their academic credentials instead of political connections. In 1894, he concluded a 10-year commercial treaty with the [[German Empire]] on favorable terms for Russia. When Alexander III died, he told his son on his deathbed to listen well to Witte, his most capable minister. In 1895, Witte established a [[state monopoly]] on alcohol, which became a major source of revenue for the Russian government. In 1896, he concluded the [[Li–Lobanov Treaty]] with [[Li Hongzhang]] of the [[Qing dynasty]]. One of the rights secured for Russia was the construction of the [[China Eastern Railway]] across [[northeast China]], which greatly shortened the route of the Trans-Siberian Railway to its projected eastern terminus at [[Vladivostok]]. However, following the [[Triple Intervention]], Witte strongly opposed the Russian occupation of [[Liaodong Peninsula]] and the construction of the naval base at [[Port Arthur naval base|Port Arthur]] in the [[Convention for the Lease of the Liaotung Peninsula|Russia–Qing Convention of 1898]].

In 1896, Witte undertook a major [[currency reform]] to place the [[Russian ruble]] on the [[gold standard]]. This led to increased investment activity and an increase in the inflow of foreign capital. Witte also enacted a law limiting working hours in enterprises in 1897, and reformed commercial and industrial taxes in 1898.&lt;ref&gt;B. V. Ananich &amp; R. S. Ganelin (1996) Nicholas II, p. 378. In: D. J. Raleigh: ''The Emperors and Empresses of Russia. Rediscovering the Romanovs''. The New Russian History Series.&lt;/ref&gt; In summer 1898 he addressed a memorandum to the Tsar&lt;ref&gt;Witte's Memoirs, pp. 211–215&lt;/ref&gt; calling for an agricultural conference on the reform of the peasant community. This resulted in three years of talks about laws abolishing collective responsibility, and facilitated the resettlement of farmers onto lands on the outskirts of the Empire. Many of his ideas were later adopted by [[Pyotr Stolypin]]. In 1902 Witte's supporter the Minister of Interior [[Dmitry Sipyagin]] was assassinated. In an attempt to keep up the modernization of the Russian economy Witte called and oversaw the Special Conference on the Needs of the Rural Industry. This conference was to provide recommendations for future reforms and the data to justify those reforms. By 1900 the growth in manufacturing industry had been four times faster than in the preceding five-year period and six times faster than in the decade before that. External trade in industrial goods was equal to that of Belgium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pages.uoregon.edu/kimball/wtt.on.ekn.htm|title=Witte on economic tasks|website=pages.uoregon.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1904 the [[Union of Liberation]] was formed demanding economic and political reform.

Witte, in a memorandum, tried to turn the reports of the [[zemstvo]] presidents into a condemnation of the Ministry of the Interior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vas8AAAAIAAJ&amp;lpg=PA376&amp;dq=Sipyagin+murder&amp;hl=nl&amp;pg=PA329#v=onepage&amp;q=condemnation&amp;f=false|title=The Cambridge Modern History|first=Sir Adolphus William|last=Ward|date=7 August 2018|publisher=CUP Archive|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a conflict on land reform [[Vyacheslav von Plehve]] accused him being part of a Jewish-masonic conspiracy.&lt;ref name="spartacus-educational.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://spartacus-educational.com/RUSwitte.htm|title=Sergei Witte|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Vasily Gurko]] Witte had dominated the irresolute Tsar and this was the moment to get rid of him. Witte was appointed on 16 August 1903 ([[Old Style|O.S.]]) as chairman of the [[Russian Council of Ministers|Committee of Ministers]], a position he held until October 1905.&lt;ref name="twilightxiv"/&gt;  While officially a promotion, the post had no real power, and Witte's removal from the influential post of Minister of Finance was engineered under the pressure from the landed gentry and his political enemies within the government and at the court. However, [[Nicholas V. Riasanovsky]] states that Witte's opposition to Russian designs on [[Korea]] caused him to resign from government in 1903.&lt;ref&gt;Riasanovsky, N. V.

===Diplomatic career===

Witte was brought back into the governmental decision-making process to help deal with the civil unrest. Confronted with growing opposition and after consulting with Witte and [[Pyotr Dmitrievich Sviatopolk-Mirsky|Prince Sviatopolk-Mirsky]], the Tsar issued a reform ukase on December 25, 1904 with vague promises.&lt;ref&gt;[[Harold Williams (linguist)|Harold Williams]], Shadow of Democracy, p. 11, 22&lt;/ref&gt; After [[Bloody Sunday 1905|Bloody Sunday]] riots of 1905 Witte supplied 500 Rubles, the equivalent of 250 dollars, to [[Father Gapon]] in order to leave the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.org/details/memoirsofcountwi00wittuoft|title=The memoirs of Count Witte|first1=Sergei IUl'evich|last1=Witte|first2=Avrahm|last2=Yarmolinsky|date=7 August 2018|publisher=Garden City, N.Y. Doubleday, Page|via=Internet Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt; Witte recommended that a manifesto be issued.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, p. 77&lt;/ref&gt; Schemes of reform would be elaborated by [[Goremykin]] and a committee consisting of elected representatives of the [[zemstva]] and municipal councils under the presidency of Witte. On 3 March the Tsar condemned the revolutionaries. The government issued a strongly worded prohibition of any further agitation in favor of a constitution.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, p. 22-23&lt;/ref&gt; By spring a new political system was beginning to form in Russia. A petition campaign with a wide variety of proposed changes, like ending the war lasted from February to July 1905. In June mutiny broke out on the [[Russian battleship Potemkin]].

Witte returned to the forefront when he was called upon by the Tsar to negotiate an end to the [[Russo-Japanese War]].&lt;ref name="twilightxiv"/&gt; He was sent as the Russian Emperor's plenipotentiary and titled "his Secretary of State and President of the Committee of Ministers of the Emperor of Russia" along with Baron [[Roman Rosen]], Master of the Imperial Court of Russia&lt;ref&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9902EFD61431E733A25754C1A9669D946497D6CF&amp;scp=6&amp;sq=order+of+meiji&amp;st=p  "Text of Treaty; Signed by the Emperor of Japan and Czar of Russia,"] ''[[New York Times]].'' October 17, 1905.&lt;/ref&gt; to the United States, where the [[Treaty of Portsmouth|peace talks]] were being held.

Witte is credited with negotiating brilliantly on Russia's behalf during the [[Treaty of Portsmouth]] negotiations. Russia lost little in the final settlement.&lt;ref name="twilightxiv"/&gt; For his efforts, Witte was created a Count.&lt;ref name="peoples.ru"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Massie, ''Nicholas and Alexandra'' P.97&lt;/ref&gt; But the loss of the war would perhaps spell the beginning of the end of Imperial Russia.

After this diplomatic success, Witte wrote to the Tsar stressing the urgent need for political reforms at home. Dissatisfaction with the proposals by Bulygin, the successor of Sviatopolk-Mirsky on 6 August (O.S.) creating a Duma as a consultative body only; the elections would not be direct but would be held in four stages, and qualifications on class and property would exclude much of the intelligentsia and all of the working classes from [[suffrage]], resulted in numerous protests, and strikes across the country. &lt;!--, which resulted in the development of new principles of formation and work of the State Duma. According to his Memoirs Witte did not force the Tsar to sign this Manifesto; besides he states nobody knew who wrote the Manifesto of 6 August. Witte suggests a member of the [[Black Hundreds]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.org/details/memoirsofcountwi00wittuoft|title=The memoirs of Count Witte|first1=Sergei IUl'evich|last1=Witte|first2=Avrahm|last2=Yarmolinsky|date=7 August 2018|publisher=Garden City, N.Y. Doubleday, Page|via=Internet Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt;During the [[Russian Revolution of 1905]] troops were sent out 2,000 times. The Tsar remained quiet, impassive and indulgent; he spent most of that autumn hunting.&lt;ref name="fig191"/&gt; Witte told Nicholas II, "that the country was at the verge of a cataclysmic revolution". Trepov was ordered to take drastic measures to stop the revolutionary activity. According to [[Orlando Figes]] the Tsar asked his uncle [[Grand Duke Nicholas]] to assume the role of dictator. "But the Grand Duke ... took out a revolver and threatened to shoot himself there and then if the Tsar refused to endorse Witte's memorandum." Nicholas II had no choice but to make a number of steps in the constitutional liberal direction.&lt;ref name="peoples.ru"/&gt; The Tsar accepted the draft, hurriedly outlined by Aleksei D. [[Obolensky]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.org/details/featuresandfigur011843mbp|title=Features And Figures Of The Past Covernment And Opinion In The Reign Of Nicholas II|first=|last=V.I.Gurko|date=7 August 2018|publisher=Russell &amp; Russell|via=Internet Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Witte's Memoirs, p. 241&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!--Witte advocated the creation of an elected [[parliament]], the formation of a [[constitutional monarchy]], and the establishment of a [[Bill of Rights]]--&gt; known as the [[October Manifesto]]. This promised to grant civil liberties such as [[freedom of conscience]], [[freedom of speech|speech]], [[freedom of association]], [[constitutional monarchy|constitutional order]], [[representative government]] and the establishment of an [[Imperial Duma]].&lt;ref name="britannica.com"/&gt; As the Duma was only a consultative body, the Council of Ministers or the Tsar had the right to block certain proposals,and many Russians felt that this reform did not go far enough;&lt;ref name="spartacus-educational.com"/&gt; nothing on [[universal suffrage]].

===Chairman of the Council of Ministers===
[[File:Prince Alexey D. Obolensky.jpeg|thumb|Prince Alexey D. Obolensky]]

The regime's usual 'incompetence and obstinacy' in response to the crisis of 1904–5 was by Witte called a 'mixture of cowardice, blindness and stupidity'.&lt;ref&gt;Figes, p. 186&lt;/ref&gt;

Witte and [[Pyotr Dmitrievich Sviatopolk-Mirsky|Sviatopolk-Mirsky]] were approached the 8th of January 1905 by a delegation of intellectuals led by [[Maxim Gorky]], who begged them to negotiate with the demonstrators, as they — after the postings of warnings of 'resolute measures' against street gatherings led by [[Father Gapon]], on 7 January — sensed the coming tragedy. They were unsuccessful as the government believed they could control Gapon.&lt;ref&gt;Figes, p. 175&lt;/ref&gt; Leaving behind visiting cards to Witte and Mirsky, Gorky was arrested with the other members of the deputations.&lt;ref&gt;Figes, p. 179&lt;/ref&gt; Father Gapon would in 1906 return to Russia from exile and support Witte's government.&lt;ref&gt;Figes, p. 178n&lt;/ref&gt; On 30 April Witte proposed the Law of Religious Toleration in 1905, followed by the edict of 30 October 1906 giving legal status to schismatics and sectarians of the ROC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pospielovsky|first=Dmitry|title=The Russian Church Under the Soviet Regime|year=1984|publisher=St. Vladimir Seminary Press|location=Crestwood|isbn=0-88141-015-2|page=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Witte argued that ending discrimination against religious rivals of the Orthodox Church 'would not harm the church, provided it embraced the reforms that would revive its religious life'. Although the Church's 'senior hierarchs' may for some time have played with the thought of self-government, Witte's demand that this would come at the cost of religious toleration 'guaranteed to drive them back into the arms of reaction'.&lt;ref name="fig69"&gt;Figes, p. 69&lt;/ref&gt; Witte had made this demand (self-government for religious toleration) in the hope of 'wooing' the important commercial groups of the Jewish and Old-Believer communities.&lt;ref name="fig69"/&gt;

Witte was approached by the Tsar's advisers, in an effort to save the country from complete collapse, and on 9 October 1905 Witte arrived to be met at the [[Winter Palace]]. Here he told 'with brutal frankness' the Tsar that the country was on the verge of a catastrophic revolution, which he said 'would sweep away a thousand years of history'. He presented the Tsar with two choices: either appoint a military dictator, or agree to broad and major reforms. In a memorandum arguing for a manifesto, Witte outlined the reforms needed to appease the masses, and this he brought with him to the Tsar. The reforms he presented were the creation of a legislative parliament ([[Imperial Duma]]) elected via a democratic franchise; granting of civil liberties; a cabinet government; and a 'constitutional order'.&lt;ref name="fig191"&gt;Figes, p. 191&lt;/ref&gt; These demands, which basically was the political programme of the [[Liberation Movement]], was an attempt to isolate the political Left by pacifying the liberals.&lt;ref name="fig191"/&gt; He also emphasised that repression only would be a temporary solution to the problem, and a risky one, because he believed the armed forces — whose loyalty was now in question — could collapse if they were to be used against the masses.&lt;ref name="fig191"/&gt; Most of the military advisers to the Tsar agreed with Witte, along with [[Governor of St. Petersburg]] [[Alexander Trepov]], who wielded a considerable influence at court. Only when Nicholas II's uncle [[Grand Duke Nikolai]] threatened to shoot himself if he did not agree to Witte's demands, following the Tsar's request of him taking position of dictator, the Tsar agreed. This would be a large source of embarrassment for the Tsar, that a former 'railway clerk', a bureaucrat and 'businessman' forced the Tsar to relinquish his autocratic rule.&lt;ref name="fig191"/&gt;{{#tag:ref|Not even his abdication in 1917 was considered as big of a humiliation than agreeing to the demands.&lt;ref name="fig192"/&gt;|group=nb}} Witte himself would later claim that the Tsar's court only were ready to use the Manifesto as a temporary concession, and later return to autocracy when the revolutionary tide subsided'.&lt;ref name="fig192"&gt;Figes, p. 192&lt;/ref&gt;

Witte was in October charged with the task of assembling the nation's first cabinet government, and he offered the liberals several portfolios (Ministry of Agriculture to [[Ivan Shipov]]; Ministry of Trade and Industry to [[Alexander Guchkov]]; Ministry of Justice to [[Anatoly Koni]] and the Ministry of Education to [[Evgenii Nikolaevitch Troubetzkoy|Evgenii Troubetzkoy]]. [[Pavel Milyukov]] and [[Prince Georgy Lvov]] were also offered ministerial posts. None of these liberals agreed to join the government though, and Witte's cabinet had to be made of 'tsarist bureaucrats and appointees lacking public confidence'. The Kadets doubted that Witte could deliver on the promises made by the Tsar in October, knowing the Tsar's staunch opposition to reform.&lt;ref&gt;Figes, p. 194–5&lt;/ref&gt;

Witte argued that the Tsarist regime only could be saved from a revolution by the transformation of Russia to a 'modern industrial society', in which 'personal and public initiatives' were encouraged by a [[rechtsstaat]] who guaranteed civil liberties.&lt;ref name="fig41"/&gt;

In the two weeks following the [[October Manifesto]], several pogroms followed. Witte ordered an official investigation, where it was revealed that the police organised, armed and gave the antisemitic crowds [[vodka]], and even contributed in the attacks. Witte demanded the prosecution of the chief of police in St. Petersburg, who was involved in the printing of agitating antisemitic pamphlets, but the Tsar intervened and protected him.&lt;ref&gt;Figes, p. 197&lt;/ref&gt; Witte believed that antisemitism was 'considered fashionable' among the elite.&lt;ref&gt;Figes, p. 242&lt;/ref&gt; Witte had once commented in the aftermath of the [[Kishinev pogrom]] in 1903, admitting that if Jews 'comprise about fifty percent of the membership in the revolutionary parties', it was 'the fault of our government. The Jews are too oppressed'.&lt;ref&gt;Figes, p. 82&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Milyukov]] once confronted Witte, asking why he would not commit himself to a constitution; to this Witte replied that he couldn't 'because the Tsar does not wish it'.&lt;ref name="fig195"&gt;Figes, p. 195&lt;/ref&gt; Witte himself was worried that the court were only using him, which emerged in talks with members of the Kadet Party.&lt;ref name="fig195"/&gt;

After his skillful diplomacy Witte was appointed Chairman of the [[Russian Council of Ministers|Council of Ministers]], the equivalent of Prime Minister, and formed [[Sergei Witte's Cabinet]], not belonging to any party, as there were none. No longer was the Tsar the head of the government. "Immediately upon my nomination as President of the Imperial Council I made it clear that the [[Procurator (Russia)|Procurator]] of the [[Most Holy Synod]] [[Konstantin Pobedonostsev]], could not remain in office, for he definitely represented the past" and was replaced by Obolensky. Trepov and [[Bulygin]] were dismissed and after many discussions [[Durnovo]] became Minister of Interior on 1 January; his appointment seems one of the greatest errors Witte made during his administration. According to Harold Williams: "That government was almost paralyzed from the beginning. Witte acted immediately by urging the release of political prisoners and the lifting of [[censorship]] laws."&lt;ref name="Williams, p. 166"&gt;Williams, p. 166&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alexander Guchkov]] and [[Dmitry Shipov]] refused to work with the reactionary Durnovo and to support the government. On 26 October (O.S.) the Tsar appointed Trepov Master of the Palace without consulting Witte, and had daily contact with the Emperor; his influence at court was paramount. &lt;!--Other reforms were put into place, but they failed to end the unrest.--&gt; "In addition mass violence broke out in the days following the issuance of the October Manifesto. The major source of the unrest was unrelated to the October Manifesto. It took the form of attacks by gangs in the cities on the Jews. In general the authorities ignored the attacks.&lt;ref name="Williams, p. 166"/&gt; On 8 November the sailors in [[Kronstadt rebellion|Kronstadt]] mutinied. In the same month the border provinces were clearly taking advantage of the weakening of Central Russia to show their teeth: {{quote|The dominating element of the Empire, the Russians, fall into three distinct ethnic branches: the Great, the Little, and the White Russians, and 35 per cent, of the population is non-Russian. It is impossible to rule such a country and ignore the national aspirations of its varied non-Russian national groups, which largely make up the population of the Great Empire. The policy of converting all Russian subjects into "true Russians" is not the ideal which will weld all the heterogeneous elements of the Empire into one body politic. It might be better for us Russians, I concede, if Russia were a nationally uniform country and not a heterogeneous Empire. To achieve that goal there is but one way, namely to give up our border provinces, for these will never put up with the policy of ruthless Russification. But that measure our ruler will, of course, never consider.&lt;ref&gt;Witte's Memoirs, p. 265&lt;/ref&gt;}} On 10 November [[Russian Poland]] was placed under [[martial law]].

Witte's position was not established. The Liberals remained obdurate and refused to be cajoled. The [[Peasants' Union (Russia)|Peasants' Union]]{{clarify|date=February 2017}} asked the Russian people not make redemption payments to the government and withdraw their deposits from bank that might be subject to government action.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, p. 220&lt;/ref&gt; He promised an eight hour working day and tried to secure vital loans from France to keep the "regime" from bankruptcy.&lt;ref name="britannica.com"/&gt; Witte send his envoy to the [[Rothschild banking family of England|Rothschild bank]]; "they would willingly render full assistance to the loan, but that they would not be in a position to do so until the Russian Government had enacted legal measures tending to improve the conditions of the Jews in Russia. As I deemed it beneath our dignity to connect the solution of our Jewish question with the loan, I decided to give up my intention of securing the participation of the Rothschilds."&lt;ref&gt;Witte's Memoirs, p. 293-294&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!--On 21 November [[Lenin]] arrived in St Petersburg. --&gt; On 24 November by Imperial decree provisional regulations on the censorship of magazines and newspaper was released.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.opentextnn.ru/censorship/russia/dorev/law/1905/|title=1905 :: Электронное периодическое издание Открытый текст|website=www.opentextnn.ru}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 16 December [[Trotsky]] and the rest of the executive committee of the [[St. Petersburg Soviet]] were arrested.&lt;ref name="spartacus-educational.com"/&gt; The Minister of Agriculture [[Nikolai Kutler]] resigned in February 1906; Witte refused to appoint [[Alexander Krivoshein]]. In the next few weeks changes and additions to the [[Russian Constitution of 1906|fundamental laws]] were made, so that the Emperor was confirmed as the dictator of foreign policies and the supreme commander of the army and navy; the ministers remained responsible solely to Nicholas II, not to the Duma. The "peasant question" or [[Land reforms by country#Russia and the Soviet Union|land reforms]] was a hot issue; the influence of the "Duma of Public Anger" had to be limited according to [[Goremykin]] and [[Dmitri Feodorovich Trepov|Dmitri Trepov]]. The [[Bolsheviks]] boycotted the coming election. When Witte discovered that Nicholas never intended to honour these concessions he resigned as Chairman of the Council of Ministers. The position and influence of General Trepov, Grand Duke Nicholas, the [[Black Hundreds]] and overwhelming victories by the [[Constitutional Democrats|Kadets]] in the [[Russian legislative election, 1906]], forced Witte on 14th to resign, which was announced 22 April 1906 (O.S.).

Witte confessed to [[Polovtsov]] in April 1906 that the success of the repressions in the wake of the [[Moscow uprising in 1905]] had made Witte lose all influence over the Tsar, and despite Witte's protests, [[Durnovo]] was allowed to 'carry out a brutal and excessive, and often totally unjustified, series of repressive measures.'&lt;ref&gt;Figes, p. 201&lt;/ref&gt;

===Member of the State Council===
[[File:Каменноостровский 5 02.jpg|thumb|Witte's mansion on [[Kamennoostrovsky Prospekt]] in St Petersburg]]

Witte continued in Russian politics as a member of the State Council but never again obtained an administrative role in the government. He was ostracized from the Russian establishment. In January 1907 a bomb was found planted in his home. The investigator [[Pavel Alexandrovich Alexandrov]] proved that the [[Okhrana]], the tsarist secret police, had been involved.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ruthenia.ru/sovlit/j/314.html «ПОКУШЕНИЕ НА МОЮ ЖИЗНЬ», «Воспоминания» С.

During the [[July Crisis]] in 1914, [[Grigori Rasputin]] and Witte desperately urged the Tsar not to enter the conflict and warned that Europe faced calamity if Russia became involved. The advice went unheeded; the French ambassador [[Maurice Paléologue]] complained to the Minister of Foreign Affairs [[Sergey Sazonov|Sazonov]]. Witte died shortly afterwards due to [[Meningitis]] or a [[brain tumor]] at his home in St. Petersburg. His third class funeral was held at the [[Alexander Nevsky Lavra]]. Witte had no children, but he adopted his wife's. According to [[Edvard Radzinsky]] Witte wished the title of count to be given to his grandson L.K. Naryshkin. Nothing is known about him.

Witte's reputation was burnished in the West when his secret memoirs were published in 1921. They had been completed in 1912 and kept in a bank in [[Bayonne]], not destined to be published while he and his contemporaries were alive. The original text of these memoirs are held in [[Columbia University]] Library's Bakhmeteff Archive of Russian and East European History and Culture.&lt;ref name="twilightxiii"/&gt;

==Career==
Seyed Mohammad Hosseini was born in Iran and joined the [[Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting]] (IRIB) service in 1994 as a TV program host. During his years at the IRIB, Hosseini was active as a producer, director, and hosted a number of game shows until 2010 when he left the IRIB. In 2011 Hosseini immigrated to the United States as a political refugee and became a vocal advocate against the Islamic Republic regime in Iran.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thedailybeast.com/the-app-powering-the-uprising-in-iran|title=The App Powering the Uprising in Iran, Where Some Channels Pushed for Violence|last=IranWire|date=2018-01-09|work=The Daily Beast|access-date=2018-01-24|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the US he has started an opposition group called "Restart" which is currently active against the Iranian regime. Since the start of his opposition group, Hosseini has attracted many young Iranians to his group with the ultimate aim of changing the Iranian regime. Hosseini encourages his followers to attack the [[Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps]] and [[Basij]] bases and government buildings throughout the country as part of his plan to cause the collapse of the regime.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2018-01-03/the-iranian-game-show-host-urging-his-fans-to-burn-mosques|title=The Iranian Game-Show Host Urging His Fans to Burn Mosques|date=2018-01-03|work=Bloomberg.com|access-date=2018-01-24|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The #RESTART movement led by Hosseini claims to have some 20 million followers worldwide and describes itself as the largest opposition group against the Islamic Republic regime in Iran.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.yasstribune.com.au/story/5207130/activist-spreads-message-through-yass-on-melbournecanberra-walk/?cs=5768|title=Activist spreads message through Yass on Melbourne–Canberra walk|last=Vue|first=Toby|date=2018-02-04|work=Yass Tribune|access-date=2018-02-05|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!--  Commented out: [[image:Stephen_Emmel_Portrait_2011.jpg|thumb|right|250px| Stephen Emmel 2011]] --&gt;

==Academic career==
Stephen Emmel was born in Rochester, NY, 27 June 1952, and earned his B.A. from [[Syracuse University]] in 1973 (department of religion). He began graduate study with [[James M. Robinson]], who took Emmel with him to Cairo, Egypt, in 1974 as a research assistant in the international project to publish the [[Coptic language|Coptic]] [[Gnosticism|Gnostic]] texts of the [[Nag Hammadi library|Nag Hammadi Codices]]. Emmel lived in Egypt 1974–77 in order to complete the conservation of the Nag Hammadi papyri in the [[Coptic Museum]]&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Emmel, &amp;ldquo;The Nag Hammadi Codices Editing Project: A Final Report,&amp;rdquo; ''Bulletin of the American Research Center in Egypt'' 104 (1978) 10&amp;ndash;32.&lt;/ref&gt; and to assist in the publication of both a facsimile edition of the Nag Hammadi Codices&lt;ref&gt;''The Facsimile Edition of the Nag Hammadi Codices'', published under the auspices of the Department of Antiquities of the Arab Republic of Egypt in conjunction with the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (12 vols.; Leiden: E.&amp;nbsp;J. Brill, 1972&amp;ndash;84).&lt;/ref&gt; and an English-language edition and translation of the texts contained in them.&lt;ref&gt;James M. Robinson, ed., ''The Coptic Gnostic Library: A Complete Edition of the Nag Hammadi Codices'' (5 vols.; Leiden etc.: Brill, 2000), reprinting volumes that were published between 1975 and 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; During those years he traveled several times to Jerusalem to meet with the Egyptologist and linguist [[Hans Jakob Polotsky|H.&amp;nbsp;J. Polotsky]] in order to deepen his knowledge of Coptic grammar.

In 1978 Emmel resumed his graduate study, now with [[Bentley Layton]] at [[Yale University]], where in 1980 he discovered a part of Nag Hammadi Codex III in the [[Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library]], which had acquired the previously unidentified fragment in 1964 among a group of miscellaneous papyri.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Emmel, &amp;ldquo;A Fragment of Nag Hammadi Codex III in the Beinecke Library: Yale Inv. 1784,&amp;rdquo; ''Bulletin of the American Society of Papyrologists'' 17 (1980) 53&amp;ndash;60.&lt;/ref&gt; Emmel’s first major publication was an edition of the Nag Hammadi text “[[Dialogue of the Saviour|The Dialogue of the Saviour]]” (1984). At about that same time, he became the first scholar to see the now famous Gnostic scripture titled “[[Gospel of Judas|The Gospel of Judas]],” in what is now called the [[Codex Tchacos]], when it was offered for sale in 1983 in Geneva, Switzerland.&lt;ref&gt;Herbert Krosney, ''The Lost Gospel: The Quest for the Gospel of Judas Iscariot'' (Washington: National Geographic, 2006), chap. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; However, in the short time allowed, Emmel did not see the title “The Gospel of Judas” in the papyrus manuscript and so was not the first person to identify the text as such.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Emmel, &amp;ldquo;L&amp;rsquo;''Évangile de Judas'', de la tombe au musée. L&amp;rsquo;épopée rocambolesque du manuscrit damné,&amp;rdquo; ''Religions &amp; Histoire'' 11 (November&amp;ndash;December 2006) 24&amp;ndash;29 (translated by Vincent Basset).&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, when the [[National Geographic Society]] was considering a project to fund the conservation and publication of the Codex Tchacos in 2004, Emmel was asked to join its “Codex Advisory Panel,”&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalgeographic.com/lostgospel/about_profiles.html] Information about Emmel and the other members of the codex advisory panel at the web site of the National Geographic Society.&lt;/ref&gt; and he also appeared in the society’s much publicized documentary about the Gospel of Judas project.&lt;ref&gt;&amp;ldquo;The Gospel of Judas: The Lost Version of Christ&amp;rsquo;s Betrayal,&amp;rdquo; directed by James Barrat for the National Geographic Channel, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Emmel earned his Ph.D. from Yale University in 1993 (department of religious studies, program in the study of ancient Christianity). His doctoral dissertation, “Shenoute’s Literary Corpus” (published in 2004), laid the groundwork for his current main research preoccupation, which is an international collaborative project to publish the writings of the ancient Coptic monastic leader [[Shenoute]] the Archimandrite (ca. 347–465).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.neh.gov/news/awards/scholarlyeditionsawards_052006.html] Emmel&amp;rsquo;s Team in 2006, and {{cite web |url=http://www.uni-muenster.de/ZeTeK/FB9.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-07-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110815122307/http://www.uni-muenster.de/ZeTeK/FB9.html |archivedate=2011-08-15 |df= }} in 2010 (in German).&lt;/ref&gt; In 1996 Emmel was appointed professor of [[Coptology]] at the Institute of Egyptology and Coptology at the [[University of Münster]] in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uni-muenster.de/IAEK/org/WMA/emmel/index.html] Emmel&amp;rsquo;s page at the web site of the Westfälische Wilhelms-Universität Münster, Institut für Ägyptologie und Koptologie (in German), and [https://www.uni-muenster.de/forschungaz/person/7584] his web page at the university&amp;rsquo;s main research web site (in both German and English).&lt;/ref&gt; During the academic year 2010&amp;ndash;11 he was on leave of absence from the University of Münster in order to serve as the first full-time professor of Coptology at the American University in Cairo.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aucegypt.edu/newsatauc/Pages/story.aspx?eid=539] A short article about Emmel at the web site of the [[American University in Cairo]].&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1976 Emmel became a charter member of the International Association for Coptic Studies,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://rmcisadu.let.uniroma1.it/~iacs/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-02-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110201011732/http://rmcisadu.let.uniroma1.it/~iacs/ |archivedate=2011-02-01 |df= }} Web site of the International Association for Coptic Studies.&lt;/ref&gt; whose first international congress (Cairo, December 1976) he helped to organize;&lt;ref&gt;James M.

==Music as a hobby==
Emmel began singing and playing piano and guitar in his youth and has maintained music-making as a hobby. An acquaintanceship with [[David Tibet]] via a common interest in the Coptic language (Tibet has an M.A. in Coptic studies from Macquarie University&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.copticcat.com/davids-coptic-studies |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-09-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110829071129/http://www.copticcat.com/davids-coptic-studies |archivedate=2011-08-29 |df= }} &amp;ldquo;David&amp;rsquo;s Coptic studies&amp;rdquo; at David Tibet&amp;rsquo;s Coptic Cat web site.&lt;/ref&gt;) resulted in Emmel performing on stage with Tibet’s band [[Current 93]] several times during 2007&amp;ndash;10. A part of one of those performances was recorded and released in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;&amp;ldquo;Birth Canal Blues&amp;rdquo; (CD, EP, Coptic Cat 002 and 003).&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Steven Cundiff''' is an American experimental [[physics|physicist]] and the Harrison M. Randall collegiate professor of [[physics]] at the [[University of Michigan]].&lt;ref name="LSA"&gt;University of Michigan Faculty Profile. https://lsa.umich.edu/physics/people/faculty/cundiff.html&lt;/ref&gt; His research interests include the production and manipulation of ultrafast pulses, in particular for applications in studying light-matter interactions. Cundiff is a Fellow of [[American Physical Society]], the [[Optical Society of America]], and the [[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers]]. He is the co-author (with [[Jun Ye]]) of the standard reference for [[frequency comb|frequency combs]] titled ''Femtosecond Optical Frequency Comb: Principle, Operation and Applications''.&lt;ref name="Googlebooks"&gt;Femtosecond Optical Frequency Comb: Principle, Operation and Applications https://www.amazon.com/dp/0387237909&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==
Cundiff's research interests broadly encompasses [[nonlinear optics|nonlinear]] light-matter interactions and advancing ultrafast optical technologies.

===Multi-Dimensional Coherent Spectroscopy (MDCS)===
Multi-dimensional coherent optical spectroscopy (MDCS) is an analogue of [[NMR spectroscopy]] at [[visible spectrum|optical]] frequencies. Initially MDCS was primarily applied to study of molecular systems, but the Cundiff research group pioneered its application to atomic vapors and semiconductor nanostructures. 

In the Cundiff group's study of atomic vapors using MDCS, notable results include direct detection of doubly-excited states induced by dipole-dipole interactions&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.108.193201|title = Two-Dimensional Double-Quantum Spectra Reveal Collective Resonances in an Atomic Vapor|date = 11 May 2012|journal = Physical Review Letters|accessdate = 1 October 2018|doi = 10.1103/PhysRevLett.108.193201|volume = 108}}&lt;/ref&gt; and an advance, via acquisition of three-dimensional spectra, towards complete characterization of the atomic vapor Hamiltonian.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms2405|title = Unraveling quantum pathways using optical 3D Fourier-transform spectroscopy|date = 22 January 2013|journal = Nature Communications|accessdate = 1 October 2018|doi = 10.1038/ncomms2405|volume = 4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A main focus of Cundiff has been the application of MDCS to spectroscopy of semiconductor nanostructures, and his group has achieved several milestones. In [[quantum well]] [[nanostructures]], MDCS was applied towards elucidating [[exciton]] many-body interactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.96.057406|title = Many-Body Interactions in Semiconductors Probed by Optical Two-Dimensional Fourier Transform Spectroscopy|date = 7 February 2006|journal = Physical Review Letters|accessdate = 3 October 2018|doi = 10.1103/PhysRevLett.96.057406|volume = 96}}&lt;/ref&gt; In epitaxial [[quantum dots]], MDCS enabled coherent control of the exciton population in the presence of inhomogeneous broadening.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.117.157402|title = Coherent Control of the Exciton-Biexciton System in an InAs Self-Assembled Quantum Dot Ensemble|date = 6 October 2016|journal = Physical Review Letters|accessdate = 3 October 2018|doi = 10.1103/PhysRevLett.117.157402|volume = 117}}&lt;/ref&gt; In interfacial quantum dots MDCS revealed induced inter-dot interactions mediated by excitation of delocalized well states, offering the possibility of another form of coherent control.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = https://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.97.081301|title = Inducing coherent quantum dot interactions|date = 15 February 2018|journal = Physical Review B|accessdate = 4 October 2018|doi = 10.1103/PhysRevB.97.081301|volume = 97}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==
Steven Cundiff graduated from [[Rutgers University]] with a [[B.A.]] in [[physics]] in 1985. Following graduation, he took a position as associate scientist at SciTec Inc. in [[Princeton, NJ]], where he remained from 1985 to 1987. Cundiff then returned to school at the [[University of Michigan]], graduating with an [[M.S.]] and [[Ph.D.]] in Applied Physics in 1991 and 1992 respectively under [[Duncan G. Steel]]. From 1993 to 1994 he was a postdoctoral researcher at the [[University of Marburg]], and from 1995 to 1997 he was a member of the technical staff at [[Bell Laboratories]].&lt;ref name="Bio"&gt;JILA Biography. {{cite web |url=http://jila.colorado.edu/cundiff/people/steven-cundiff |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-03-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160310133647/http://jila.colorado.edu/cundiff/people/steven-cundiff |archivedate=2016-03-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Thomas Edward Allibone was born in [[Sheffield]] in 1903. He was educated at the Central School in Sheffield followed by a Pass (Ordinary) degree in physics at [[Sheffield University]]. In 1925, Allibone was awarded a scholarship by the [[Metropolitan-Vickers]] company to study the properties of [[zirconium]]. He left Sheffield in 1926 to continue his postgraduate studies at [[Gonville and Caius College]], [[Cambridge University]]. At Cambridge, he worked in the prestigious [[Cavendish Laboratory]], with eminent scientists such as [[Ernest Rutherford|Rutherford]], [[John Cockcroft|Cockcroft]], and [[Ernest Walton|Walton]]. The use of high voltages to accelerate particles into each other became of particular interest to him. After gaining a first class honours degree in physics from Cambridge, Allibone returned to Metropolitan-Vickers, to take charge of their high-voltage research laboratory at [[Trafford Park]], [[Manchester]].

==Career==
Allibone remained at Metropolitan Vickers throughout the 1930s and 1940s, publishing a number of scientific papers on subjects such as high voltage research, and X-ray tubes.

During the Second World War, Allibone was involved in a number of research projects including [[radar]] equipment and the highly secretive [[Tube Alloys]] project. In 1944 Allibone formed part of a team of British scientists sent to the [[United States]], to work on the [[Manhattan Project]], which developed the world's first [[atomic bomb]].

In 1946, Allibone was appointed director of the [[Associated Electrical Industries|AEI]] research laboratories at [[Aldermaston Court]]. Whilst at Aldermaston Court, Allibone was involved in pioneering research into [[nuclear fusion]] and [[electron microscopes]], and was elected a [[Fellow of the Royal Society]] in 1948.

In 1963, Allibone left Aldermaston Court to become the [[Central Electricity Generating Board]]'s chief scientist, a post he held until 1970. He also became External Professor of Electrical Engineering at the [[University of Leeds]] in 1967.

Allibone was one of the sponsors of the election to Fellowship of the Royal Society  of his friend, the physicist [[John Samuel Forrest]], Director of the Central Electricity Research Laboratory. Allibone wrote the obituary on Forrest, published by the Royal Society in 1994.

==Honours==

In 1959 he presented both the [[Bernard Price Memorial Lecture]] in South Africa and the [[Royal Institution Christmas Lectures]].

'''Zebah''' ({{Lang-he|זֶ֫בַח}} ''Zeḇaḥ'', "sacrifice", '''Zebee''' in the [[Brenton Septuagint Translation]] and the [[Douai-Rheims Bible]]) and '''Zalmunna''' (צַלְמֻנָּע ''Ṣalmunnā‘'', "shade denied", '''Salmana''' in the Brenton Septuagint Translation and the Douai-Rheims Bible) were the two kings who led the vast host of the [[Midian]]ites who invaded the [[land of Israel]], and over whom [[Gideon]] gained a great and decisive victory ([[Book of Judges|Judges]] 8). Zebah and Zalmunna had succeeded in escaping across the [[Jordan River]] with a remnant of the Midianite host, but were overtaken at Karkor, probably in the [[Hauran]], and routed by [[Gideon]]. The kings were taken alive and brought back across the Jordan; and confessing that they had personally taken part in the killing of Gideon's brothers, they were put to death.

Their demise is remembered and invoked in {{bibleverse||Psalms|83:9-11|NKJV}}:
:''Deal with them as with Midian ... yes, all their princes like Zebah and Zalmunna''.

See also [[Books of Samuel|1 Samuel]] 12:11 and [[Book of Isaiah|Isaiah]] 10:26.
