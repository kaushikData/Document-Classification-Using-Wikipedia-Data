'''''Al-Bernameg''''' ({{lang-ar|البرنامج}}, [[Egyptian Arabic]] &lt;nowiki&gt; pronunciation: [&lt;/nowiki&gt;elberˈnæːmeɡ], literally "The Show") was an Egyptian news satire program. The show was hosted by [[Bassem Youssef]] on the free-to-air channel [[MBC MASR]] and reruns are aired on [[Deutsche Welle]]; it was formerly broadcast on the satellite channels [[Capital Broadcast Center|CBC]] and OnTV Egypt. Bassem Youssef announced on 2 June 2014 that the show was cancelled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.ahram.org.eg/News/102760.aspx|title=UPDATED: Bassem Youssef's El-Bernameg gone for good|date=2 June 2014|work=Ahram Online|accessdate=2 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Its satirical style, willing to poke fun at powerful personages across the political spectrum, has led the press to compare it with ''[[The Daily Show]]'' hosted by [[Jon Stewart]], which was the inspiration for the show. Bassem Youssef visited ''The Daily Show'' as a guest in June 2012 and April 2013, while Stewart, on hiatus from his own hosting duties, returned the favour on 25 October 2013. On 1 November 2013, the show was pulled from CBC over differences with the broadcaster.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContent/1/0/85369/Egypt/-Bassem-Youssefs-TV-show-ElBernameg-suspended-CBC-.aspx|title=Bassem Youssef's TV show El-Bernameg suspended: CBC channel|date=1 November 2013|work=Ahram Online|accessdate=2 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The suspension of the show raised questions about media freedom in Egypt following the [[2013 Egyptian coup d'état]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContent/1/64/85402/Egypt/Politics-/Freedoms-in-Egypt-questioned-after-ElBernamegs-sus.aspx|title=Freedoms in Egypt questioned after El-Bernameg's suspension|date=2 November 2013|work=Ahram Online|accessdate=2 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In early 2014, MBC MASR picked up the show, airing its first episode on 7 February 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.aswatmasriya.com/news/view.aspx?id=10dc9376-9f98-4a87-8dc0-13d75db79979|title=MBC: Satirist Bassem Youssef returns to screen next Friday|date=1 February 2014|work=Aswat Masriya|accessdate=2 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==''The B+ Show''==
Following the 18-day-protests of the [[Egyptian Revolution of 2011|Jan 25th revolution]], ''The B+ Show'' was created by Tarek AlKazzaz and [[Bassem Youssef]], as a political satire show commenting on the events and how the mainstream media presented them. Together they teamed up with Amr Ismail as Producer and Mohamed Khalifa as Director of a 5-minute episode for online viewing.

''The B+ Show'' was named after Youssef’s blood type; B+, and was shot entirely in Youssef’s laundry room with one table, one chair, one camera and a banner with amateur images of [[Tahrir Square]].

For every five-minute episode, Youssef and his team used to watch up to ten hours of videos for research to help them write the script.

Uploaded for the first time in May 2011, ''The B+ Show'' gained more than five million views in the first three months alone, on its YouTube Channel.

Nine webisodes later, Egyptian channel ONTV offered Youssef to create a political satire TV show ''Al-Bernameg'', literally translating to "the show".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cairo360.com/article/tvanddvd/1619/cairo-360-presents-the-bassem-youssef-show-b|title= Cairo 360 Presents: The Bassem Youssef Show (B+)|date=27 March 2011|work=Cairo 360|accessdate=2 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Al-Bernameg'' Season 1==
The show’s move to Egyptian channel ONTV made it one of the first internet to TV conversion in the [[Middle East]].

The show premiered in Ramadan 2011, and became the platform for many writers, artists, and politicians to speak freely about the social and political scene.

Season one of ''Al-Bernameg'' aired a total of 104; 30-min episodes and was produced by Qsoft Ltd.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/user/albernameg&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Al-Bernameg'' Season 2==
Despite the great success of ''Al-Bernameg'' on ONTV, the team always aspired to be the first live-audience TV show of its genre in the Middle East. Having that vision in mind, [[Ahmed Abbas]], the Chief Operations Officer of Qsoft and ''Al-Bernameg''’s Project Director, started working on taking this idea further to create a multifaceted brand for Al-Bernameg. In the summer of 2012, the team successfully reached a deal with Capital Broadcast Network (CBC) to air the new season of the show with the new format, moving it from ONTV’s studios to the majestic building of Radio Cinema and Theatre, which is an exact replica of [[Radio City Music Hall]] in New York, accommodating 220 guests in total for every episode. ''Al-Bernameg'', which aired its premiere in November 2012, was the first to have a live audience in the Middle East and recorded one of the highest viewership ratings on both TV and Internet; with a combined viewership of around 120 million on YouTube alone.

Radio Theatre, which is owned by Al-Ismailia for Real Estate Investment, underwent a massive renovation process to transform it into a live audience studio for the show while maintaining the aesthetics of the architecture and the interiors of the historical building. Under the leadership of the same Executive Producer, Amr Ismail, the team hired the production designer, Christopher George, and the lighting director, Mark Kenyon, of ''[[The X Factor (UK TV series)|The X-Factor UK]]'' to design the new set of ''Al-Bernameg''.&lt;ref&gt;http://al-ismaelia.com/buildings/&lt;/ref&gt;

The second season of ''Al-Bernameg'' consisted of 29 episodes. The show gained tremendous success through its humorous yet bold criticism of former Egyptian President [[Mohamed Morsi]], representing the Muslim Brotherhood.

The show’s format evolved to include three segments, starting with Youssef's usual witty and humorous observations on current events, sketches performed by the team, and ending with guests from the entire political spectrum, music bands and artistic talents.

As ''Al-Bernameg'' continued with its growing success, Jon Stewart appeared as a guest on the show in June 2013, marking one of the all-time highlights of ''Al-Bernameg'' episodes. Other celebrity guests such as [[Amr Waked]], in addition to a large number of Egypt’s and the region’s most popular music bands and performers, appeared on the show. ''Al-Bernameg'' also enjoyed diversity in its audience every week, including public figures such as [[Hamdeen Sabahi]], [[Yosri Fouda]], [[Elissa (Lebanese singer)|Elissa]], [[Assala Nasri]], [[Ziad Rahbani]] and [[Angham]].

Soon after the show started airing, complaints were filed against it and its host, with accusations of insulting Islam, President Morsi and disrupting public order and peace. However, ''Al-Bernameg''’s team sustained its critical tone, risking the future of the show and holding on to the right of freedom of expression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2012/12/02/bassem-youssefs-el-bernameg-in-trouble-on-cbc/|title=Bassem Youssef’s El-Bernameg in trouble on CBC|date=2 December 2012|work=Daily News Egypt|accessdate=2 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Season two of ''Al-Bernameg'' aired a total of 29 60-min episodes.

==''Al-Bernameg'' Season 3==
In October 2013, CBC suspended the airing of ''Al-Bernameg'' season 2, claiming that “the show has not been abiding by the editorial policy of the network.” In February 2014, Al-Bernameg returned with its third season, on MBC Masr satellite channel&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContent/1/64/90445/Egypt/Politics-/Bassem-Youssef-joins-MBC-Misr-channel-.aspx|title=Bassem Youssef joins MBC Misr channel|date=30 December 2013|work=Ahram Online|accessdate=2 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; with a second re-run on Deutsche Welle (DW). The show achieved unprecedented viewership ratings every week.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dw.de/special-guest-bassem-youssef/a-17582625|title=Special guest: Bassem Youssef|date=22 April 2014|work=Deutsche Welle|accessdate=2 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Season three of ''Al-Bernameg'' aired 11 60-min episodes.

In March 2014 [[Nilesat]] announced that it was investigating [[Radio jamming|jamming]] of broadcasts of ''Al-Bernameg'', credit for which had been claimed by an organisation known as the Egyptian Cyber Army.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://en-maktoob.news.yahoo.com/nilesat-investigating-jamming-el-bernameg-024118930.html|title=NileSat investigating jamming of El-Bernameg|date=16 March 2014|work=[[Maktoob]]|accessdate=2 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2014 MBC announced that they would suspend broadcasting of the show until the end of May “to avoid influencing Egyptian voters’ opinion and public opinion” in the run-up to the [[Egyptian presidential election, 2014|2014 Egyptian presidential election]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.humanrightsfirst.org/blog/satirist-bassem-youssef-pulled-air-until-after-egyptian-elections|title=Satirist Bassem Youssef pulled from air until after Egyptian Elections|last1=Hofsommer|first1=Molly|date=25 April 2014|website=[[Human Rights First]]|accessdate=2 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2014, Youssef announced the termination of ''Al-Bernameg'' where he said that the pressure on him, his family, and MBC had become too great.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dw.de/egyptian-satirist-bassem-youssef-stops-show-fearing-for-safety/a-17678157&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Hausa_from_Yola-1902.jpg|thumb|right|A 1902 drawing of a Hausa man from [[Yola, Nigeria|Yola]] in an Alasho]]'''Alasho''' is an indigenous [[Hausa people|Hausa]] long [[turban]], worn across the head and neck. It is near identical in length, colour and dimensions to that of the [[Tuareg]] [[tagelmust]], but is wrapped differently to the Tuareg method, leaving the sides of the head and some of the lower neck free. A similar style turban is worn by [[Songhai people|Songhai]] men, known as 'fatalaa' in [[Zarma language|Zarma]].

Once common throughout Hausa society as common male clothing, today it only survives when used for important occasions or ceremonies, rite of passage rituals to the adult age, marriage or in the inauguration of a social leader. The Alasho veil has traditionally been manufactured in [[Kano]], and was sold to Tuareg and Songhay clients and traders.

==Response==
Charles Isherwood, reviewing the Sean Hayes production in ''[[The New York Times]]'', called the play "a gut-busting-funny riff on the never-ending folly of mankind’s attempts to fathom God’s wishes through the words of the Bible and use them to their own ends."&lt;ref name=sean/&gt;

The ''TheaterMania'' reviewer of the Hayes production called the play "still just mildly amusing...The major difference in this presentation comes in the form of Hayes, who brings an extra touch of frivolity to a play that really calls for it."&lt;ref&gt;Stewart, Zachary. [http://www.theatermania.com/broadway/reviews/an-act-of-god_77357.html "Reviews. 'An Act of God'"] theatermania.com, June 6, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5862">This article deals with the [[phonology]] of [[Avestan]]. Avestan is one of the [[Iranian languages]] and retained archaic [[voiced alveolar fricative]]s. It also has [[fricative consonant|fricatives]] rather than the [[aspirated consonant|aspirated series]] seen in the closely related [[Indo-Aryan languages]].

According to Beekes, {{IPA|[ð]}} and {{IPA|[ɣ]}} are allophones of /θ/ and /x/ respectively.

==={{anchor|sh-rt}}''š'' versus ''rt''===
Avestan ''š'' continues Indo-Iranian ''*-rt-''. Its phonetic value and its phonological status (one or two phonemes) are somewhat unclear.
The conditions under which change from ''-rt-'' to ''-š-'' occurs are fundamentally ill-defined. Thuz, for example, Gathic/Younger ''ərəta''/''arəta'' ('establish') is a variant of ''aša'' but is consistently written with ''r t''/. Similarly, ''arəti'' ('portion') and ''[[aši]]'' ('recompense'). But ''[[Amesha Spenta|aməša]]'' ('immortal') is consistently written with ''š'', while ''marəta''&lt;!-- cf Gayomart/Gayō Marətan --&gt; ('mortal') is consistently written with ''r t''. In some instances, a change is evident in only Younger Avestan. For example, the Gathic Avestan word for "bridge" is ''[[Chinvat bridge|pərətūm]]'', while in Younger Avestan it is ''pəšūm''. Both are singular accusative forms, but when the word is singular nominative, the Younger Avestan variant is again (and all but once) with ''r t''.

Benveniste suggested ''š'' was only a convenient way of writing /rt/ and should not be considered phonetically relevant.&lt;ref name="Miller_1968_274"&gt;{{harvnb|Miller|1968|p=274}}.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Gray, ''š'' is a misreading, representing /r r/, of uncertain phonetic value but "probably" representing a [[Voiceless consonant|voiceless]] ''r''.&lt;ref name="Grey_1941_102_103"&gt;{{harvnb|Gray|1941|pp=102–103}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Miller follows the older suggestion that Avestan ''š'' represents a phoneme of its own, for which he introduces the symbol "/Ř/" and identifies phonetically as {{IPAblink|r̝|r̝̥|}} (the voiceless allophone of [[Czech language|Czech]] ''ř''). He goes on to suggest that in writing, ''-rt-'' was restored when a scribe was aware of a [[morpheme]] boundary between the /r/ and /t/.&lt;ref name="Miller_1968_275"&gt;{{harvnb|Miller|1968|p=274,275,282}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Transcription==
There are various conventions for transliteration of [[Din Dabireh]].  We adopt the following one here.
Vowels:
:a ā ə ə̄ e ē o ō å ą i ī u ū
Consonants:
:k g γ x xʷ č ǰ t d δ ϑ t̰ p b β f
:ŋ ŋʷ ṇ ń n m y w r s z š ṣ̌ ž h

The glides ''y'' and ''w'' are often transcribed as ''ii'' and ''uu'', imitating Din Dabireh orthography. The letter transcribed ''t̰'' indicates an allophone of {{IPA|/t/}} with [[no audible release]] at the end of a word and before certain [[obstruent]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Mark |last=Hale |authorlink=Mark Hale |chapter=Avestan |title=The Cambridge Encyclopedia of the World's Ancient Languages |editor=Roger D.

{{refimprove|date=October 2012}}
[[File:Android sculpture with Noogler beanie.jpg|thumb|An [[Android (operating system)|Android]] sculpture at [[Googleplex]] featuring a multicolored beanie topped by a propeller]]
In the United States, a '''beanie''' is a head-hugging brimless [[cap]], with or without a [[visor]], made from triangular sections of cloth joined by a button at the crown and seamed together around the sides. It can also be made from leather or silk panels.

In other English-speaking countries and parts of the US, a "beanie" is a [[knit cap|knitted cap]] (often woollen), known in parts of the United States as a "stocking cap" or "beanie" and in Canada as a "[[tuque]]".

== Styles ==
One popular style of the beanie during the early half of the twentieth century was a kind of [[Zucchetto|skullcap]] made of four or six felt panels sewn together to form the cap.  The panels were often composed of two or more different contrasting colors to give them a novel and distinctive look.  This type of beanie was also very popular with some colleges and fraternities, as they would often use [[school color]]s in the different panels making up the garment.

Another style of beanie was the [[whoopee cap]], a formed and pressed wool [[felt]]ed hat, with a flipped up brim that formed a band around the bottom of the cap.  The band would often have a decorative repeating zig-zag or scalloped pattern cut around the edge.  It was also quite common for schoolboys to adorn their beanies with buttons and pins.

== Etymology ==
The cloth-covered button on the crown is about the size of a [[bean]] seed and may be the origin of the term "beanie". Some academics believe that the term is instead derived from a type of headgear worn in some medieval universities. The yellow hats (''bejaunus'', meaning "yellowbill", later ''beanus'', a term used for both the hats and the new students) evolved into the college beanies of later years.&lt;ref&gt;Kimbrough, Walter M. ''Black Greek 101: the culture, customs, and challenges of Black fraternities''. Fairleigh Dickinson University Press, 2003, p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the ''[[Oxford Dictionary]]'', the etymology is uncertain, but probably derives from the slang term "bean", meaning "head". In [[New Zealand]] and [[Australia]], the term "beanie" is normally applied to a knit cap known as a [[tuque]] in Canada and parts of the US, but also may apply to the kind of skull cap historically worn by surf lifesavers&lt;ref&gt;Anonymous. [http://sls.com.au/who-we-are/history Our history], Surf Life Saving Australia, 15 July 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; and still worn during surf sports.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20130206091222/http://slsnz.org.nz/NORTHERN/Article.aspx?ID=2142 Surf Sports] at Surf Life Saving NZ&lt;/ref&gt; The non-knitted variety is normally called a "cap" in other countries.

In the United Kingdom, the term "Benny Hat" may also refer to a knitted style of headcovering. This name originally comes from the character "Benny", played by actor [[Paul Henry (actor)|Paul Henry]] in the British ''[[Crossroads (soap opera)|Crossroads]]'' soap opera. The character appeared from the mid-1970s to the late-1980s and usually wore a knitted version of the hat.

== History ==
A larger variant of the skullcap, the beanie was working apparel associated with [[blue collar]] laborers, including welders, mechanics, and other tradesmen who needed to keep their hair back, but for whom a brim would be an unnecessary obstruction.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}} Beanies do sometimes have a very small brim, less than an inch deep, around the brow front. The [[baseball cap]] evolved from this kind of beanie, with the addition of a visor to block the sun.{{Citation needed|date=August 2013}}

By the mid-1940s, beanies fell out of general popularity as a hat, in favor of cotton visored caps like the baseball cap. However, in the 1950s and possibly beyond, they were worn by college freshmen and various fraternity initiates as a form of mild [[hazing]]. For example, [[Lehigh University]] required freshmen to wear beanies, or "dinks", and other colleges including Franklin &amp; Marshall, Gettysburg, Rutgers, Westminster College and others may have had similar practices.&lt;ref&gt;Haydock, Michael D. [https://web.archive.org/web/20121006011219/http://www.historynet.com/the-gi-bill-cover-page-october-99-american-history-feature.htm/3 Excerpt from "The GI Bill"]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Benedictine College]], in [[Atchison, Kansas]], still carries this tradition for the first week of a freshman's classes,&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110928143648/http://www.benedictine.edu/FileUploads/StudentHandbook2010-2011.pdf Excerpt from ''Benedictine College Student Handbook''], 2010-2011, p. 84.&lt;/ref&gt; and is said to be the only college in the US to maintain this tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Minnis, Stephen D. [https://web.archive.org/web/20111017061752/http://benedictine.edu/benedictine.aspx?pgID=1034 "Beanie Banquet" Speech], [[Benedictine College]]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Wilson College (Pennsylvania)|Wilson College]] continues this tradition today as a part of its Odd/Even class year "rivalry". &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wilson.edu/about-wilson-college/history-and-traditions/index.aspx 'About Wilson College - History and Traditions'] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130430182823/http://www.wilson.edu/about-wilson-college/history-and-traditions/index.aspx |date=April 30, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=={{anchor|Propeller beanie|Propellerhead}}Propeller beanie==

In the late 1940s, while still in high school, [[science fiction fanzine]] artist [[Ray Nelson]] adopted the use of the propeller beanie as emblematic shorthand for [[science fiction fandom]].  This was in self-mockery of the popular image of fans as childish and concerned with [[ephemera]] (such as [[science fiction]]). References to the distinctive headwear are now used to identify old-fashioned fans, as opposed to more modern fans of [[science fiction television|media science fiction]].

The propeller beanie increased in popular use through comics and eventually made its way onto the character of Beany Boy of ''[[Beany and Cecil]]''. Today, computer [[geek|savvy]] and other technically proficient people are sometimes pejoratively called propellerheads because of the one-time popularity of the propeller beanie.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/propeller-head "propellerhead"] at [[Merriam-Webster]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 21st century, propeller beanies are rarely seen on the street, and are primarily worn for satirical or comedic purposes.

In 1996, student [[MIT hacks|hackers]] placed a giant propeller beanie on the Great Dome at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]].  The scaled-up propeller rotated as the wind drove it like a [[windmill]].

The '''Chale Wote Street Art Festival''' &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Four Word Story: Chale Wote Street Art Festival|url=http://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/artikel.php?ID=238025|publisher=Ghana Web|accessdate=8 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chale Wote Street festival brings street art to James Town|url=http://www.ghanamusic.com/news/upcoming-events/chale-wote-street-festival-brings-street-art-to-james-town/index.html|publisher=Ghanamusic.com|accessdate=8 September 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121120212932/http://www.ghanamusic.com/news/upcoming-events/chale-wote-street-festival-brings-street-art-to-james-town/index.html|archivedate=20 November 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; also known as '''Chale Wote''' is an alternative platform that brings [[art]], [[music]], [[dance]] and performance out into the [[Street|streets]]. The [[festival]] targets exchanges between scores of local and [[international]] artists and patrons by creating and appreciating art together.

Since 2011, CHALE WOTE has included street painting, graffiti murals, photography, theater, spoken word, interactive art installations, live street performances, extreme sports, film shows, a fashion parade, a music block party, recyclable design workshops and much more. It is the first to be organized&lt;ref name="CW2011" /&gt; in [[Accra]], [[Ghana]] and has inspired similar events across the country. There have been 6 editions so far; the first two ran for one day each, while the 2013 and 2014 edition ran concurrently for two days, the former in September and the latter in August, a week after the Homowo festival of the Ga people at the historical [[Jamestown, Ghana]] on the [[High Street]] in Accra. The format switched in 2016 when the festival lasted an entire week, from August 18 - 21. This switch saw the festival hop from the open street gallery that is Jamestown to other art spaces, such as the [[Nubuke Foundation]], the Museum of Science and Technology as well as film screenings at the Movenpick Ambassador Hotel. The same format will be replicated in the 7th edition, themed, Wata Mata &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://accradotaltradio.com/2017/04/chale-wote-2017-call-artists/|title=CHALE WOTE 2017: CALL FOR ARTISTS|last=|first=|date=4 April 2017|website=ACCRA[dot]ALT|accessdate=4 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;with further immersion into Accra, spreading to areas such as Nima, Osu and more. The event is produced by Accra [dot] Alt Radio,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ACCRA [dot] ALT Radio {{!}} Live from the Ghana Space Station|url=http://www.accradotaltradio.com/|publisher=Accra [dot] Alt Radio|accessdate=24 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  with support from  other local cultural networks like Attukwei Art Foundation, Foundation for Contemporary Art Ghana, Dr. Monk, Redd Kat Pictures and the [[Institut français]] in Ghana.{{Citation needed|date=April 2014}}

[[File:Athletics competitions.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Competition in sports. A selection of images showing some of the sporting events that are classed as [[sport of athletics|athletics]] competitions.]]

'''Competition''' is, in general, a contest or rivalry between two or more entities, organisms, animals, individuals, economic groups or social groups, etc., for [[territory (animal)|territory]], a niche, for scarce [[resource]]s, goods, for mates, for [[:wikt:prestige|prestige]], [[Recognition (sociology)|recognition]], for [[award]]s, for group or social status, or for [[leadership]] and [[Profit (economics)|profit]].&lt;ref&gt;Simandan, D., 2017. Competition, contingency, and destabilization in urban assemblages and actor-networks. Urban Geography, pp.1-12. https://doi.org/10.1080/02723638.2017.1382307 
&lt;/ref&gt; It arises whenever at least two parties strive for a goal which cannot be shared, where one's gain is the other's loss (an example of which is a [[zero-sum game]]).&lt;ref&gt;Smith, K.G., Ferrier, W.J. and Ndofor, H., 2001. Competitive dynamics research: Critique and future directions. Handbook of strategic management, pp.315-361.&lt;/ref&gt;

Competition occurs [[nature|naturally]] between living organisms which co-exist in the same [[natural environment|environment]].&lt;ref name="Keddy, P.A 2001"&gt;Keddy, P.A. 2001. ''Competition'', 2nd ed., Kluwer, Dordrecht. 552 p.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, animals compete over water supplies, food, mates, and other [[resource (biology)|biological resources]]. Humans usually compete for food and mates, though when these needs are met deep rivalries often arise over the pursuit of [[wealth]], power, prestige, and [[celebrity|fame]].

Competition is often considered to be the opposite of [[cooperation]], however in the real world, mixtures of cooperation and competition are the norm.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sociologyguide.com/basic-concepts/Competition.php Competition], Sociology guide&lt;/ref&gt; Optimal strategies to achieve goals are studied in the branch of mathematics known as [[game theory]].

Competition is also a major tenet of [[market economy|market economies]] and business. It is often associated with business competition as most companies are in competition with at least one other firm over the same group of customers. Also competition inside a company is usually stimulated with the larger purpose of meeting and reaching higher quality of services or improved products that the company may produce or develop.

== Consequences ==
Competition can have both beneficial and detrimental effects. Many evolutionary biologists view inter-species and intra-species competition as the driving force of [[adaptation]], and ultimately of [[evolution]]. However, some biologists disagree, citing competition as a driving force only on a small scale, and citing the larger scale drivers of evolution to be abiotic factors (termed 'Room to Roam').&lt;ref name="SahneyBentonFerry2010"&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://rsbl.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/6/4/544.full.pdf+html | author=Sahney, S., Benton, M.J. and Ferry, P.A. | year=2010 | title=Links between global taxonomic diversity, ecological diversity and the expansion of vertebrates on land | journal=Biology Letters | doi=10.1098/rsbl.2009.1024 | volume = 6 | pages = 544–47 |format=PDF | issue=4 | pmid=20106856 | pmc=2936204}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Richard Dawkins]] prefers to think of evolution in terms of competition between single genes, which have the welfare of the organism 'in mind' only insofar as that welfare furthers their own selfish drives for replication (termed the 'selfish gene').

Some [[social Darwinist]]s claim that competition also serves as a mechanism for determining the best-suited group; politically, economically and ecologically. Positively, competition may serve as a form of [[recreation]] or a challenge provided that it is non-hostile. On the negative side, competition can cause injury and loss to the organisms involved, and drain valuable resources and energy. In the human species competition can be expensive on many levels, not only in lives lost to war, physical injuries, and damaged psychological well beings, but also in the health effects from everyday civilian life caused by work stress, long work hours, abusive working relationships, and poor working conditions, that detract from the enjoyment of life, even as such competition results in financial gain for the owners.

== Biology and ecology ==
&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Natural selection]] --&gt;
{{Main|Competition (biology)}}
Competition within, between, and among species is one of the most important forces in biology, especially in the field of [[ecology]].&lt;ref name="Keddy, P.A 2001"/&gt;

Competition between members of a species ("intraspecific") for resources such as [[food]], [[water]], [[Territory (animal)|territory]], and [[sunlight]] may result in an increase in the frequency of a variant of the species best suited for survival and reproduction until its fixation within a population. However, competition among resources also has a strong tendency for diversification between members of the same species, resulting in coexistence of competitive and non-competitive strategies or cycles between low and high competitiveness. Third parties within a species often favour highly competitive strategies leading to species extinction when environmental conditions are harsh ([[evolutionary suicide]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Baldauf|first1=Sebastian A.|last2=Engqvist|first2=Leif|last3=Weissing|first3=Franz J.|title=Diversifying evolution of competitiveness|journal=Nature Communications|date=29 October 2014|volume=5|pages=5233|doi=10.1038/ncomms6233|pmid=25351604}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Competition is also present between species ("interspecific"). When resources are limited, several species may depend on these resources. Thus, each of the species competes with the others to gain access to the resources. As a result, species less suited to compete for the resources may [[extinction|die out]] unless they [[adaptation|adapt]] by character dislocation, for instance. According to [[evolutionary theory]], this competition within and between species for resources plays a significant role in [[natural selection]]. At shorter time scales, competition is also one of the most important factors controlling diversity in ecological communities, but at larger scales expansion and contraction of ecological space is a much more larger factor than competition.&lt;ref name="SahneyBentonFerry2010"/&gt; This is illustrated by living plant communities where asymmetric competition and competitive dominance frequently occur.&lt;ref name="Keddy, P.A 2001"/&gt; Multiple examples of symmetric and asymmetric competition also exist for animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Borzée|first1=Amaël|last2=Kim|first2=Jun Young|last3=Jang|first3=Yikweon|title=Asymmetric competition over calling sites in two closely related treefrog species|journal=Scientific Reports|date=7 Sep 2016|volume=6|page=32569|doi=10.1038/srep32569|pmc=5013533|pmid=27599461}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Game theory==
{{main|Game theory}}
Game theory is "the study of [[mathematical model]]s of conflict and cooperation between intelligent rational decision-makers."&lt;ref name=Myerson&gt;[[Roger B. Myerson|Myerson, Roger B.]] (1991). ''Game Theory: Analysis of Conflict,'' Harvard University Press, p.&amp;nbsp;[https://books.google.com/books?id=E8WQFRCsNr0C&amp;printsec=find&amp;pg=PA1 1]. Chapter-preview links, pp. [https://books.google.com/books?id=E8WQFRCsNr0C&amp;printsec=find&amp;pg=PR7 vii–xi].&lt;/ref&gt; Game theory is mainly used in [[economics]], [[political science]], and [[psychology]], as well as [[logic]], [[computer science]], [[biology]] and [[poker]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887323610704578625812355516182|title=The Science of Winning Poker|author=Christopher Chabris|date=26 July 2013|work=WSJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; Originally, it mainly addressed [[zero-sum game]]s, in which one person's gains result in losses for the other participants.

Game theory is a major method used in [[mathematical economics]] and business for [[Economic model|modeling]] competing behaviors of interacting [[Agent (economics)|agent]]s.&lt;ref name=r1/&gt; Applications include a wide array of economic phenomena and approaches, such as [[auction]]s, [[bargaining]], [[mergers &amp; acquisitions]] pricing,&lt;ref name="GT-A-E-00"/&gt; [[fair division]], [[Duopoly|duopolies]], [[Oligopoly|oligopolies]], [[social network]] formation, [[agent-based computational economics]],&lt;ref name=r2/&gt; [[general equilibrium]], [[mechanism design]],&lt;ref name=r3/&gt; and [[voting system]]s;&lt;ref name=r4/&gt; and across such broad areas as [[experimental economics]],&lt;ref name=r5/&gt; [[Behavioral game theory|behavioral economics]],&lt;ref name=r6/&gt; [[information economics]],&lt;ref name=r7/&gt; [[industrial organization]],&lt;ref name=r8/&gt; and [[political economy]].&lt;ref name=r9/&gt;&lt;ref name=r10/&gt;

This research usually focuses on particular sets of strategies known as [[Solution concept|"solution concepts" or "equilibria"]]. A common assumption is that players act rationally. In non-cooperative games, the most famous of these is the [[Nash equilibrium]]. A set of strategies is a Nash equilibrium if each represents a best response to the other strategies. If all the players are playing the strategies in a Nash equilibrium, they have no unilateral incentive to deviate, since their strategy is the best they can do given what others are doing.&lt;ref name="GT-F-R-09"&gt;[http://www.insead.edu/facultyresearch/research/doc.cfm?did=46503 Game-theoretic model to examine the two tradeoffs in the acquisition of information for a careful balancing act] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130524231021/http://www.insead.edu/facultyresearch/research/doc.cfm?did=46503 |date=2013-05-24 }} Research paper [[INSEAD]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="GT-F-R-10"&gt;[http://www.europeanfinancialreview.com/?p=4645 Options Games: Balancing the trade-off between flexibility and commitment] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130620053305/http://www.europeanfinancialreview.com/?p=4645 |date=June 20, 2013 }}.

==Economics and business==
{{Main|Competition (economics)}}

Merriam-Webster defines competition in business as "the effort of two or more parties acting independently to secure the business of a third party by offering the most favorable terms".&lt;ref&gt;[http://m-w.com/dictionary/competition m-w.com]&lt;/ref&gt;  It was described by [[Adam Smith]] in ''[[The Wealth of Nations]]'' and later economists as allocating productive [[resource]]s to their most highly valued uses and encouraging [[X-inefficiency|efficiency]].&lt;ref&gt;[[George J. Stigler]] ([[The New Palgrave: A Dictionary of Economics|[1987]]] 2008). "competition," ''[[The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics]]''. [http://www.dictionaryofeconomics.com/article?id=pde2008_C000261&amp;q=competition&amp;topicid=&amp;result_number=6 Abstract.]&lt;/ref&gt; Later [[microeconomic theory]] distinguished between [[perfect competition]] and [[imperfect competition]], concluding that no system of resource allocation is more efficient than [[perfect competition]]. Competition, according to the theory, causes commercial firms to develop new products, services and technologies, which would give consumers greater selection and better products. The greater selection typically causes lower prices for the products, compared to what the price would be if there was no competition ([[monopoly]]) or little competition ([[oligopoly]]).

However, competition may also lead to wasted (duplicated) effort and to increased [[cost]]s (and prices) in some circumstances. For example, the intense competition for the small number of [[superstar|top jobs in music and movie acting]] leads many aspiring musicians and actors to make substantial investments in training which are not recouped, because only a fraction become successful. Critics have also argued that competition can be destabilizing, particularly competition between certain financial institutions.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Simkovic, [http://ssrn.com/abstract=1924831 ''Competition and Crisis in Mortgage Securitization'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Experts have also questioned the constructiveness of competition in profitability. It has been argued that competition-oriented objectives are counterproductive to raising revenues and profitability because they limit the options of strategies for firms as well as their ability to offer innovative responses to changes in the market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://marketing.wharton.upenn.edu/documents/research/CompOrientPDF%2011-27%20%282%29.pdf |title=The Profitability of Winning |author1=J. Scott Armstrong |author2=Fred Collopy |journal=Chief Executive |pages=61–63 |year=1994 |access-date=2011-12-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100622023252/http://marketing.wharton.upenn.edu/documents/research/CompOrientPDF%2011-27%20(2).pdf |archive-date=2010-06-22 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the strong desire to defeat rival firms with competitive prices has the strong possibility of causing price wars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://qbox.wharton.upenn.edu/documents/mktg/research/Profitability%20of%20winning.pdf | title = Competitor-oriented Objectives: The Myth of Market Share |author1=J. Scott Armstrong |author2=Kesten C. Greene | journal = International Journal of Business | volume = 12 | issue = 1 | pages = 116–34 | year = 2007 | issn= 1083-4346}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Three levels of economic competition have been classified:

* The most narrow form is '''direct competition''' (also called category competition or brand competition), where [[product (business)|products]] which perform the same function compete against each other. For example, one brand of pick-up trucks competes with several other brands of pick-up trucks. Sometimes, two companies are rivals and one adds new products to their line, which leads to the other company distributing the same new things, and in this manner they compete.
* The next form is '''substitute''' or '''indirect competition''', where products which are close substitutes for one another compete. For example, butter competes with margarine, mayonnaise and other various sauces and spreads.
* The broadest form of competition is typically called '''budget competition'''. Included in this category is anything on which the [[consumer]] might want to spend their available [[income|money]]. For example, a family which has $20,000 available may choose to spend it on many different items, which can all be seen as competing with each other for the family's expenditure. This form of competition is also sometimes described as a competition of "share of wallet".

In addition, companies also compete for [[finance|financing]] on the capital markets (equity or debt) in order to generate the necessary cash for their operations. An [[investor]] typically will consider alternative investment opportunities given his risk profile and not only look at companies just competing on product ('''direct competitors'''). Enlarging the investment universe to include '''indirect competitors''' leads to a broader peer universe of comparable, indirectly competing companies.

Competition does not necessarily have to be between companies. For example, business writers sometimes refer to '''internal competition'''. This is competition within companies. The idea was first introduced by [[Alfred Sloan]] at [[General Motors Corporation|General Motors]] in the 1920s. Sloan deliberately created areas of overlap between divisions of the company so that each division would be competing with the other divisions. For example, the [[Chevrolet]] division would compete with the [[Pontiac]] division for some [[market segment]]s. The competing brands by the same company allowed parts to be designed by one division and shared by several divisions, for example parts designed by Chevrolet would also be used by Pontiac. Also, in 1931, [[Procter &amp; Gamble]] initiated a deliberate system of internal brand-versus-brand rivalry. The company was organized around different [[brand]]s, with each brand allocated resources, including a dedicated group of employees willing to champion the brand. Each brand manager was given responsibility for the success or failure of the brand, and compensated accordingly.

Finally, most businesses also encourage competition between individual employees. An example of this is a contest between sales representatives. The sales representative with the highest sales (or the best improvement in sales) over a period of time would gain benefits from the employer. This is also known as '''intra-brand competition.'''

Shalev and Asbjornsen also found that success (i.e. the saving resulted) of [[reverse auction]]s correlated most closely with competition. The literature widely supported the importance of competition as the primary driver of reverse auctions success.&lt;ref&gt;[http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1727409 papers.ssrn.com]&lt;/ref&gt; Their findings appear to support that argument, as competition correlated strongly with the reverse auction success, as well as with the number of bidders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/39032383/Electronic-Reverse-Auction-and-the-Public-Sector-Factors-of-Success-Moshe-E-Shalev-Stee-Asbjorensen |publisher= Shalev Moshe and Asbjornsen Stee |title=Electronic reverse auctions and the public sector – Factors of success |work=Journal of Public Procurement |pages=428–52 |volume=10 |issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It should also be noted that business and economic competition in most [[country|countries]] is often limited or restricted. Competition often is subject to legal restrictions. For example, competition may be legally prohibited, as in the case with a [[government monopoly]] or a [[government-granted monopoly]]. [[Tariffs]], [[subsidies]] or other [[protectionist]] measures may also be instituted by government in order to prevent or reduce competition. Depending on the respective economic policy, pure competition is to a greater or lesser extent regulated by [[competition policy]] and [[competition law]].  Another component of these activities is the discovery process, with instances of higher [[government regulation]]s typically leading to less competitive businesses being launched.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cato.org/pub_display.php?pub_id=884&amp;full=1 Competition, Regulation, and the Market Process: An "Austrian" Perspective, Sept. 30, 1982] by [[Israel M. Kirzner]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Interstate===
{{See also|Race to the bottom}}
Competition between countries is quite subtle to detect, but is quite evident in the [[world economy]]. Countries compete to provide the best possible business environment for [[multinational corporations]]. Such competition is evident by the policies undertaken by these countries to educate the future workforce. For example, East Asian economies such as Singapore, Japan and South Korea tend to emphasize education by allocating a large portion of the budget to this sector, and by implementing programmes such as [[gifted education]].

===Law===
{{Main|Competition law}}
[[File:U.S. Department of Justice headquarters, August 12, 2006.jpg|thumb|right|The [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]] building in [[Washington, D.C.]] is home to the influential [[United States antitrust law|antitrust]] enforcers of U.S. competition laws]]
Competition [[law]], known in the [[United States]] as antitrust law, has three main functions. First, it prohibits agreements aimed to restrict free trading between business entities and their customers. For example, a [[cartel]] of sports shops who together fix football jersey prices higher than normal is illegal.&lt;ref&gt;''JJB Sports v OFT [2004] CAT 17''&lt;/ref&gt; Second, competition law can ban the existence or abusive behaviour of a firm dominating the market. One case in point could be a software company who through its [[monopoly]] on computer platforms makes consumers use its media player.&lt;ref&gt;in the E.U. side of the saga, see [http://europa.eu.int/jurisp/cgi-bin/gettext.pl?lang=en&amp;num=79958777T1904%20R0201_2&amp;doc=T&amp;ouvert=T&amp;seance=ORD&amp;where=() Case T-201/04] ''Microsoft v. Commission'' Order, 22 December 2004&lt;/ref&gt; Third, to preserve competitive markets, the law supervises the [[mergers and acquisitions]] of very large corporations. Competition authorities could for instance require that a large packaging company give plastic bottle [[license]]s to competitors before taking over a major [[Polyethylene terephthalate|PET]] producer.&lt;ref&gt;Case C-12/03 P, Commission v. Tetra Laval&lt;/ref&gt; In this case (as in all three), competition law aims to protect the [[consumer welfare|welfare of consumers]] by ensuring business must compete for its share of the [[market economy]].

In recent decades, competition law has also been sold as good medicine to provide better [[public services]], traditionally funded by [[tax]] payers and administered by [[Democracy|democratically]] accountable [[government]]s. Hence competition law is closely connected with the law on deregulation of access to markets, providing state aids and subsidies, the [[privatisation]] of state-owned assets and the use of independent sector regulators, such as the United Kingdom telecommunications watchdog [[Ofcom]]. Behind the practice lies the theory, which over the last fifty years has been dominated by [[neo-classical economics]]. Markets are seen as the most efficient method of allocating resources, although sometimes [[market failure|they fail]], and regulation becomes necessary to protect the ideal market model. Behind the theory lies the history, reaching back further than the [[Roman Empire]]. The business practices of market traders, [[guilds]] and governments have always been subject to scrutiny and sometimes severe sanctions. Since the twentieth century, competition law has become global. The two largest, most organised and influential systems of competition regulation are [[United States antitrust law]] and [[European Community competition law]]. The respective national authorities, the [[U.S. Department of Justice]] (DOJ) and the [[Federal Trade Commission]] (FTC) in the United States and the [[Directorate-General for Competition (European Commission)|European Commission's Competition Directorate General]] (DGCOMP) have formed international support and enforcement networks. Competition law is growing in importance every day, which warrants for its careful study.

== Trade ==

Competition is also found in [[trade]]. For nations, as well as firms it is important to understand trade dynamics in order to market their goods and services effectively in international markets. [[Balance of trade]] can be considered a crude, but widely used proxy for international competitiveness across levels: [[country]], [[industry]] or even [[business|firm]]. Research data hints that exporting firms have a higher survival rate and achieve greater employment growth compared with non-exporters.

Using a simple concept to measure heights that firms can climb may help improve execution of strategies. International competitiveness can be measured on several criteria but few are as flexible and versatile to be applied across levels as Trade Competitiveness Index (TCI) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://kmomaya.files.wordpress.com/2015/05/ijm_pranusha_bhokray_momaya_export_competitiveness_pre-publication_review.pdf | title = Export Competitiveness of Select Firms from India: Glimpse of Trends and Implications |author1=Manthri P. |author2=Bhokray K. |author3=Momaya K.

== Politics ==
Competition is also found in [[politics]]. In [[democracy|democracies]], an [[election]] is a competition for an elected office. In other words, two or more candidates strive and compete against one another to attain a position of power. The winner gains the seat of the elected office for a predefined period of time, towards the end of which another election is usually held to determine the next holder of the office.

In addition, there is inevitable competition inside a government. Because several offices are appointed, potential candidates compete against the others in order to gain the particular office. Departments may also compete for a limited amount of resources, such as for [[budget|funding]]. Finally, where there are [[party systems]], elected leaders of different parties will ultimately compete against the other parties for [[law]]s, [[funding]] and [[political power|power]].

Finally, competition also exists between [[government]]s. Each [[country]] or [[nationality]] struggles for world dominance, power, or [[military]] strength. For example, the [[United States]] competed against the [[Soviet Union]] in the [[Cold War]] for world power, and the two also struggled over the different types of government (in these cases [[representative democracy]] and [[communism]]). The result of this type of competition often leads to worldwide tensions, and may sometimes erupt into [[war]]fare.

== Sports ==
{{Anchor|Competitive sports}}&lt;!-- Previous title. 2013-07-01 --&gt;
[[File:US Olympic Committee Headquarters by David Shankbone.jpg|thumb|The [[United States Olympic Committee]]'s headquarters in [[Colorado Springs, Colorado]]. The [[Olympic Games]] are regarded as the international pinnacle of sports competition.]]
While some [[sport]]s and [[game]]s (such as [[fishing]] or [[hiking]]) have been viewed as primarily recreational, most sports are considered competitive. The majority involve competition between two or more persons (sometimes using [[horse racing|horses]] or [[auto racing|cars]]). For example, in a game of [[basketball]], two teams compete against one another to determine who can score the most points. When there is no set reward for the winning team, many players gain a sense of [[pride]]. In addition, extrinsic rewards may also be given. Athletes, besides competing against other humans, also compete against [[nature]] in sports such as [[whitewater kayaking]] or [[mountaineering]], where the goal is to reach a destination, with only natural barriers impeding the process. A regularly scheduled (for instance annual) competition meant to determine the "best" competitor of that cycle is called a [[championship]].
[[File:Citi Field Day.jpg|thumb|left|[[Baseball]], a competitive sport]]
Competitive sports are governed by codified rules agreed upon by the participants. Violating these rules is considered to be [[unfair competition]]. Thus, sports provide artificial (not natural) competition; for example, competing for control of a ball, or defending territory on a playing field is not an innate biological factor in humans. Athletes in sports such as [[gymnastics]] and competitive [[Diving (sport)|diving]] compete against each other in order to come closest to a conceptual ideal of a perfect performance, which incorporates measurable criteria and standards which are translated into numerical ratings and scores by appointed judges.

Sports competition is generally broken down into three categories: '''individual''' sports, such as [[archery]]; '''dual''' sports, such as [[tennis|doubles tennis]], and '''team''' sports competition, such as [[cricket]] or [[football]]. While most sports competitions are recreation, there exist several [[Major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada|major]] and [[minor league|minor]] professional sports leagues throughout the world. The [[Olympic Games]], held every four years, is usually regarded as the international pinnacle of sports competition.

== Education ==
Competition is a major factor in education. On a global scale, national education systems, intending to bring out the best in the next generation, encourage competitiveness among students through [[scholarships]]. Countries such as England and Singapore have [[special education]] programmes which cater for specialist students, prompting charges of [[academic elitism]]. Upon receipt of their academic results, students tend to compare their grades to see who is better. In severe cases, the pressure to perform in some countries is so high that it can result in stigmatization of intellectually deficient students, or even suicide as a consequence of failing the exams; Japan being a prime example (see [[Education in Japan]]). This has resulted in critical re-evaluation of examinations as a whole by educationalists {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}. Critics of competition as a motivating factor in education systems, such as [[Alfie Kohn]], assert that competition actually has a net negative influence on the achievement levels of students, and that it "turns all of us into losers" (Kohn 1986). Economist [[Richard Layard]] has commented on the harmful effects, stating "people feel that they are under a great deal of pressure. They feel that their main objective in life is to do better than other people. That is certainly what young people are being taught in school every day. And it's not a good basis for a society."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-13052639 ''Group dedicated to happiness launched in UK'', BBC video, April 12, 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;

However, other studies such as the [[Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking]] show that the effect of competition on students depends on each individual's level of [[Agency (philosophy)|agency]]. Students with a high level of agency thrive on competition, are self-motivated, and are willing to risk failure. Compared to their counterparts who are low in agency, these students are more likely to be flexible, adaptable and creative as adults.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

== Literature ==
Literary competitions, such as contests sponsored by [[literary journals]], publishing houses and theaters, have increasingly become a means for aspiring writers to gain recognition. Awards for fiction include those sponsored by the ''[[Missouri Review]]'', ''[[Boston Review]]'', ''[[Indiana Review]]'', ''[[North American Review]]'' and ''[[Southwest Review]]''. The [[Edward Albee|Albee]] Award, sponsored by the Yale Drama Series, is among the most prestigious playwriting awards.{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}

== Consumer competitions - games of luck or skill==
{{further|Game of chance}}
In Australia, New Zealand and the United Kingdom, competitions or lottos are the equivalent of what are commonly known as [[sweepstakes]] in the United States. The correct technical name for Australian consumer competitions is a trade promotion lottery or lottos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.olgr.nsw.gov.au/promos_trade_promos.asp |title=OLGR &gt; Promotions and competitions &gt; Trade promotion lotteries |publisher=Olgr.nsw.gov.au |date= |accessdate=2013-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Competition or trade promotion lottery entrants enter to win a prize or prizes, hence many entrants are all in competition, or competing for a limited number of prizes.

A trade promotion lottery or competition is a free entry lottery run to promote goods or services supplied by a business. An example is where you purchase goods or services and then given the chance to enter into the lottery and possibly win a prize. A trade promotion lottery can be called a lotto, competition, contest, sweepstake, or giveaway.

Such competitions can be games of luck (randomly drawn) or skill (judged on an entry question or submission), or possibly a combination of both.

People that enjoy entering competitions are known as compers. Many compers attend annual national conventions. In 2012 over 100 members of the online competitions community of lottos.com.au from around Australia met on the Gold Coast, Queensland to discuss competitions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lottos.com.au/competitions/viewthreadlite.php?tid=275933 |title=NATIONAL LOTTOS MEET GOLD COAST 16TH SEPTEMBER 2012 :) |publisher=Lottos.com.au |date= |accessdate=2013-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amv7jMwbHIw&amp;t=6s |title=Comp Queens |publisher=Aca.ninemsn.com.au |date=2012-09-21 |accessdate=2013-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Study==
Competition has been studied in several fields, including [[psychology]], [[sociology]] and [[anthropology]]. Social [[psychologist]]s, for instance, study the nature of competition. They investigate the natural urge of competition and its circumstances. They also study [[group dynamics]], to detect how competition emerges and what its effects are. [[Sociologist]]s, meanwhile, study the effects of competition on society as a whole. In addition, [[anthropologist]]s study the history and prehistory of competition in various cultures. They also investigate how competition manifested itself in various [[culture|cultural]] settings in the past, and how competition has developed over time.

==Competitiveness==
{{Main|Competitiveness}}
Many [[philosopher]]s and [[psychologist]]s have identified a trait in most living organisms which can drive the particular organism to compete. This trait, called competitiveness, is viewed as an innate [[biology|biological]] [[Trait (biological)|trait]] {{citation needed|date=April 2017}}which coexists along with the urge for survival. Competitiveness, or the inclination to compete, though, has become synonymous with aggressiveness and ambition in the [[English language]]. More advanced [[civilization]]s integrate aggressiveness and competitiveness into their [[Social interaction|interactions]], as a way to distribute resources and adapt. Many plants compete with neighboring ones for sunlight.

However, [[Stephen Jay Gould]] and others have argued that as one ascends the evolutionary hierarchy, competitiveness (the survival instinct) becomes less innate, and more a learned behavior.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}} The same could be said for co-operation: in humans, at least, both co-operation and competition are considered learned behaviors{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}, because the human species learns to adapt to environmental pressures. Consequently, if survival requires competitive behaviors, the individual will compete, and if survival requires co-operative behaviors, the individual will co-operate. In the case of humans, therefore, aggressiveness may be an innate characteristic, but a person need not be competitive at the same time, for instance when scaling a cliff. On the other hand, humans seem also to have a nurturing instinct, to protect newborns and the weak. While that does not necessitate co-operative behavior, it does help.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

The term also applies to [[econometrics]]. Here, it is a comparative measure of the ability and performance of a firm or sub-sector to sell and produce/supply goods and/or services in a given market. The two academic bodies of thought on the assessment of competitiveness are the '''Structure Conduct Performance Paradigm''' and the more contemporary '''New Empirical Industrial Organisation''' model. Predicting changes in the competitiveness of business sectors is becoming an integral and explicit step in public policymaking. Within capitalist economic systems, the drive of enterprises is to maintain and improve their own competitiveness.

=== Hypercompetitiveness ===
The tendency toward extreme, unhealthy competition has been termed '''hypercompetitiveness'''. This concept originated in [[Karen Horney]]'s theories on [[neurosis]]; specifically, the highly aggressive personality type which is characterized as "moving against people". In her view, some people have a need to compete and win at all costs as a means of maintaining their [[self-esteem|self-worth]]. These individuals are likely to turn any activity into a competition, and they will feel threatened if they find themselves losing. Researchers have found that men and women who score high on the trait of hypercompetitiveness are more [[Narcissism|narcissistic]] and less psychologically healthy than those who score low on the trait.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Ryckman, R.

C. |year=1994 |title= Personality correlates of the hypercompetitive attitude scale: Validity tests of Horney's theory of neurosis |work=[[Journal of Personality Assessment]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hypercompetitive individuals generally believe that "[[winning isn't everything; it's the only thing]]".{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}

It promotes a "climate of competitive egoism and individualism", with competition for jobs and competition between employees; Marx said competition between workers exceeds that demonstrated by company owners.&lt;ref name="allenb"&gt;
Allen E. Buchanan, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=j1AOAAAAQAAJ&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;hl=bg&amp;pg=PP1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Marx and justice: the radical critique of liberalism]'', [[Taylor &amp; Francis]], 1982
&lt;/ref&gt; He also points out that competition separates individuals from one another and while concentration of workers and development of better communication alleviate this, they are not a decision.&lt;ref name="allenb"/&gt;

===Freud===
[[Sigmund Freud]] explained competition as a primal dilemma in which all infants find themselves. The infant competes with other family members for the attention and affection of the parent of the opposite sex or the primary caregiving parent. During this time, a boy develops a deep fear that the father (the son's prime rival) will punish him for these feelings of desire for the mother, by castrating  him. Girls develop penis envy towards all males. The girl’s envy is rooted in the biologic fact that, without a penis, she cannot sexually possess mother, as the infantile id demands, resultantly, the girl redirects her desire for sexual union upon father in competitive rivalry with her mother. This constellation of feelings is known as [[Oedipus Complex]] ( after the Greek Mythology figure who accidentally killed his father and married his mother). This is associated with the [[phallic stage]] of childhood development where intense primal emotions of competitive rivalry with (usually) the parent of the same sex are rampant and create a crisis that must be negotiated successfully for healthy psychological development to proceed. Unresolved Oedipus complex competitiveness issues can lead to lifelong neuroses manifesting in various ways related to an overdetermined relationship to competition.

===Mahatma Gandhi===
[[Mahatma Gandhi|Gandhi]] speaks of egoistic competition.&lt;ref name="Gandhi"&gt;
Parmeshwari Dayal, [https://books.google.com/books?id=FemHmw5fGQUC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;hl=bg&amp;pg=PP1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Gandhian Theory of Social Reconstruction], Atlantic Publishers &amp; Dist, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; For him, such qualities glorified and/or left unbridled, can lead to violence, conflict, discord and destructiveness. For Gandhi, competition comes from the ego, and therefore society must be based on mutual love, cooperation and sacrifice for the well-being of humanity.&lt;ref name="Gandhi"/&gt; In the society desired by Gandhi, each individual will cooperate and serve for the welfare of others and people will share each other's joys, sorrows and achievements as a norm of a social life. For him, in a non-violent society, competition does not have a place and this should become realized with more people making the personal choice to have fewer tendencies toward egoism and selfishness.&lt;ref name="Gandhi"/&gt;

The '''denarius''' ({{IPA|/deː.ˈnaː.rɪ.ʊs/}}, &lt;small&gt;{{abbr|pl.|plural}}&lt;/small&gt; '''dēnāriī''', {{IPA|/deː.ˈnaː.rɪ.iː/}}) was the standard [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] silver coin from its introduction in the [[Second Punic War]] c. 211 BC&lt;ref&gt;Crawford, Michael H. (1974). Roman Republican Coinage, Cambridge University Press, 2 Volumes. {{ISBN|0-521-07492-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; to the reign of [[Gordian III]] (AD 238–244), when it was gradually replaced by the [[Antoninianus]]. It continued to be minted in very small quantities, likely for ceremonial purposes, until and through the [[tetrarchy]] (293–313).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=David. L. Vagi|title=Coinage and History of the Roman Empire, c. 82 BC- AD 480|volume=II|publisher=Coin World|location=Sydney, Ohio}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|87}}

The word ''dēnārius'' is derived from the [[Latin]] ''dēnī'' "containing ten", as its value was originally of 10 [[As (coin)|assēs]].&lt;ref group=note&gt;Its value was increased to 16 assēs in the middle of the 2nd century BC.&lt;/ref&gt; The word for "money" descends from it in Italian  (''denaro''), Slovene (''denar''), Portuguese (''dinheiro''), and Spanish (''dinero''). Its name also survives in the [[dinar]] currency.

Its symbol is represented in [[Unicode]] as 𐆖 (U+10196), however it can also be represented as X̶ (capital letter X with combining long stroke overlay).

==History==
[[File:Fineness_of_early_Roman_Imperial_silver_coins.png|thumb|500px|Starting with [[Nero]] in AD 64, the Romans continuously debased their silver coins until, by the end of the 3rd century AD, hardly any silver was left.]]
A predecessor of the ''denarius'' was first struck in 267 BC, five years before the [[First Punic War]],&lt;ref&gt;A Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities, William Smith, D.C.l., LL, D., John Murray, London 1875 Pg 393, 394&lt;/ref&gt; with an average weight of 6.81&amp;nbsp;[[gram]]s, or {{frac|1|48}} of a [[Roman pound]]. Contact with the Greeks prompted a need for silver coinage in addition to the bronze currency that the Romans were using at that time. The predecessor of the ''denarius'' was a Greek-styled silver coin called the ''didrachm'' which was struck in Neapolis and other Greek cities in southern Italy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Oxford Handbook of Greek and Roman Coinage|last=Metcalf|first=William E.|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2012|isbn=978-0-19-937218-8|location=198 Madison Avenue, New York, NY 10016|pages=300}}&lt;/ref&gt; These coins were inscribed for Rome but closely resemble their Greek counterparts. They were most likely used for trade purposes and were seldom used in Rome.

The first distinctively Roman silver coin appeared around 226 BC.&lt;ref&gt;The Numismatic Circular, Volume 8–9, Spink &amp; Son, 1899–1900 Piccadilly West, London&lt;/ref&gt; Classic historians sometimes called these coins ''denarii'', but they are classified by modern numismatists  as [[quadrigatus|''quadrigati'']], which is derived from the quadriga, or four-horse chariot, on the reverse, and which with a two-horse chariot or ''biga'' was the prototype for the most common designs used on Roman silver coins for the next 150 years.&lt;ref&gt;Handbook to Life in Ancient Rome, Lesley Adkins and Roy A. Adkins. Oxford University Press, New York 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;As the Romans Did, Jo-Ann Shelton. Oxford University Press, New York 1998&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch's Lives, Vol 2, John Langhorne, DD, William Langhorne, AM, London 1813&lt;/ref&gt;

Rome overhauled its coinage around 211 BC and introduced the denarius alongside a short-lived denomination called the [[victoriatus]]. This denarius contained an average 4.5&amp;nbsp;grams, or {{frac|1|72}} of a Roman pound, of silver. It formed the backbone of Roman currency throughout the [[Roman Republic|Roman republic]].&lt;ref&gt;The New Deal in Old Rome, HJ Haskell, Alfred K Knoff New York 1939&lt;/ref&gt;

The denarius began to undergo slow debasement toward the end of the republican period. Under the rule of [[Augustus]] (31 BC-AD 14) its silver content fell to 3.9&amp;nbsp;grams (a theoretical weight of {{frac|1|84}} of a Roman pound). It remained at nearly this weight until the time of [[Nero]] (AD 37–68), when it was reduced to {{frac|1|96}} of a pound, or 3.4&amp;nbsp;grams. Debasement of the coin's silver content continued after Nero. Later Roman emperors reduced its content to 3&amp;nbsp;grams around the late 3rd century.&lt;ref&gt;Ancient coin collection 3Wayne G Sayles Pg 21–22&lt;/ref&gt;

The value at its introduction was 10 [[as (coin)|asses]], giving the denarius its name, which translates as "containing ten". In about 141 BC, it was re-tariffed at 16 asses, to reflect the decrease in weight of the [[as (coin)|as]]. The denarius continued to be the main coin of the [[Roman Empire]] until it was replaced by the [[antoninianus]] in the middle of the 3rd century. The coin was last issued, in bronze, under [[Aurelian]] between AD 270 and 275, and in the first years of the reign of [[Diocletian]]. ('Denarius', in ''A Dictionary of Ancient Roman Coins'', by John R. Melville-Jones (1990)).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wildwinds.com/coins/ric/aurelian/t.html |title=Aurelian, Roman Imperial Coinage reference, Thumbnail Index|publisher=Wildwinds.com |accessdate=24 August 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wildwinds.com/coins/sear/s3272.html |title=Aurelian Æ Denarius.

| 267 || Predecessor || 6.81g || ? || 1/48 pound. Equals 10 ''asses'', giving the denarius its name, which translates as "containing ten". The original copper coinage was weight-based, and was related to the Roman pound, the ''libra'', which was about 325 g. The basic copper coin, the ''as'', was to weigh 1 Roman pound. This was a large cast coin, and subdivisions of the ''as'' were used. The "pound" (libra etc) continued to be used as a currency unit, and survives e.g. in the British monetary system, which still uses the pound, abbreviated as £.
|-
| 211|| Introduction || 4.55g || 95–98% || 1/72 pound. Denarius first struck. According to Pliny, it was established that the ''denarius'' should be given in exchange for ten pounds of bronze, the ''quinarius'' for five pounds, and the ''sestertius'' for two-and-a-half. But when the ''as'' was reduced in weight to one ounce, the denarius became equivalent to 16 ''asses'', the ''quinarius'' to eight, and the ''sestertius'' to four; although they retained their original names. It also appears, from Pliny and other writers, that the ancient ''libra'' was equivalent to 84 ''denarii''.

|-
| 200 || Debasement || 3.9g || 95–98% || 1/84 pound.

|-
| 141 || Debasement || 3.9g || 95–98% || 1/84 pound. Retariffed to equal 16 ''asses'' due to the decrease in weight of the ''as''.

|-
| 44BC || Debasement || 3.9g || 95–98% || Death of Julius Caesar, who set the denarius at 3.9g. Legionary (professional soldier) pay was doubled to 225 denarii per year.
|-

|-
| 14–37 ||   || 3.9g || 97.5–98% || Tiberius slightly improved the fineness as he gathered his infamous hoard of 675 million denarii.

|-
| 64–68 || Debasement || 3.41g || 93.5% || 1/96 pound. This more closely matched the Greek drachm. In 64, Nero reduced the standard of the ''aureus'' to 45 to the Roman pound (7.2 g) and of the ''denarius'' to 96 to the Roman pound (3.30 g). He also lowered the denarius to 94.5% fine. Successive emperors lowered the fineness of the ''denarius''; in 180 Commodus reduced its weight by one-eighth to 108 to the pound.

|-
| 85–107 || Debasement || 3.41g || 93.5% || Reduction in silver content under Domitian

|-
| 148–161 ||  Debasement  || 3.41g || 83.5% ||

|-
| 193–235 || Debasement   || 3.41g || 83.5% || Several emperors (193–235) steadily debased the ''denarius'' from a standard of 78.5% to 50% fine. In 212 Caracalla reduced the weight of the ''aureus'' from 45 to 50 to the Roman pound. They also coined the ''aes'' from a bronze alloy with a heavy lead admixture, and discontinued fractional denominations below the ''as''. In 215 Caracalla introduced the ''antoninianus'' (5.1 g; 52% fine), a double denarius, containing 80% of the silver of two ''denarii''. The coin invariably carried the radiate imperial portrait. Elagabalus demonetized the coin in 219, but the senatorial emperors Pupienus and Balbinus in 238 revived the ''antoninianus'' as the principal silver denomination which successive emperors reduced to a miserable{{clarify|date=July 2018}} billon coin (2.60 g; 2% fine).
|-
| 241 ||  Debasement  || 3.41g || 48% ||

|-
| 274 ||  Double Denarius || 3.41g || 5% || In 274, the emperor Aurelian reformed the currency and his denominations remained in use until the great recoinage of Diocletian in 293. Aurelian struck a radiate ''aurelianianus'' of increased weight (84 to the Roman pound) and fineness (5% fine) that was tariffed at five notational{{clarify|date=July 2018}} ''denarii'' (sometimes called "common denarii" or "denarii communes"by modern writers, although this phrase does not appear in any ancient text). The coin carried on the reverse the numerals XXI, or in Greek κα (both meaning 21 or 20:1). Some scholars believe that this shows that the coin was equal to 20 sestertii{{clarify|date=July 2018}} (or 5 denarii), but it is more likely that it was intended to guarantee that it contained 1/20 or 5% of silver, and was thus slightly better than baby of the coins in circulation. The ''aureus'' (minted at 50 or 60 to the Roman pound) was exchanged at rates of 600 to 1,000 denarii, equivalent to 120 to 200 ''aurelianiani''. Rare fractions of billion{{clarify|date=July 2018}} denarii, and of bronze ''sestertii'' and ''asses'', were also coined. At the same time, Aurelian reorganized the provincial mint at Alexandria, and he minted an improved Alexandrine ''tetradrachmon'' that might{{clarify|date=July 2018}} have been tariffed at par with the ''aurelianianus''.

The emperor Tacitus in 276 briefly doubled the silver content of the ''aurelianianus'' and halved its tariffing{{clarify|date=July 2018}} to 2.5 d.c. (hence{{clarify|date=July 2018}} coins of Antioch and Tripolis (in Phoenicia) carry the value marks X.I), but Probus (276–282) immediately returned the ''aurelianianus'' to the standard and tariffing{{clarify|date=July 2018}} of Aurelian, and was the official tariffing until the reform of Diocletian in 293.

|-
| 735 ||  ''Novus denarius'' (new penny) ||   ||    || [[Pepin the Short]] (r. 751–768), the first king of the Carolingian dynasty and father of [[Charlemagne]], minted the ''novus denarius'' ("new penny"): 240 pennies minted from one Carolingian pound. So a single coin contained 21 grains of silver. Around 755, Pepin's [[Carolingian Reform]] established the European monetary system, which can be expressed as: 1 pound = 20 shillings = 240 pennies. Originally the pound was a weight of silver rather than a coin, and from a pound of pure silver 240 pennies were struck. The Carolingian Reform restored the silver content of the penny that was already in circulation and was the direct descendant of the Roman denarius.  The shilling was equivalent to the ''solidus'', the money of account that prevailed in Europe before the Carolingian Reform; it originated from the Byzantine gold coin that was the foundation of the international monetary system for more than 500 years. Debts contracted prior to the Reform were defined in ''solidi''. For three centuries following the reform, the only coin minted in Europe was the silver penny. Shillings and pounds were units of account used for convenience to express large numbers of pence, not actual coins. The reform also reduced the number of mints, strengthened royal authority over the mints, and provided for uniform design of coins. All coins bore the ruler's name, initial, or title, signifying royal sanction of the quality of the coins. Charlemagne spread the Carolingian system throughout Western Europe. The Italian lira and the French livre were derived from the Latin word for pound. Until the French Revolution, the unit of account in France was the livre, which equalled 20 sols or sous, each of which in turn equaled 12 deniers. During the Revolution the franc replaced the livre, and Napoleon's conquest spread the franc to Switzerland and Belgium. The Italian unit of account remained the lira, and in Britain the pound-shilling-penny relationship survived until 1971. Even in England the pennies were eventually debased, leaving 240 pennies representing substantially less than a pound of silver, and the pound as a monetary unit became divorced from a pound weight of silver. After the breakup of the [[Carolingian Empire]] pennies debased much faster, particularly in Mediterranean Europe, and in 1172 Genoa began minting a silver coin equal to four pennies. Rome, Florence, and Venice followed with coins of denominations greater than a penny, and late in the 12th century Venice minted a silver coin equal to 24 pennies. By the mid-13th century Florence and Genoa were minting gold coins, effectively ending the reign of the silver penny (denier, denarius) as the only circulating coin in Europe.

|-
| 757–796 ||  Penny ||   ||    || [[Offa]], king of Mercia, minted and introduced to England a penny of 22.5 grains of silver. The coin's designated value, however, was that of 24 troy grains of silver (one [[pennyweight]], or 1/240 of a troy pound, or about 1.56 grams), with the difference being a premium attached by virtue of the minting into coins ([[seigniorage]]). The penny led to the term "penny weight". 240 actual pennies (22.5 grains; minus the 1.5 grain for the seigniorage) weighed only 5400 troy grains, known as a [[Saxon pound]] and later known as the tower pound, a unit used only by mints. The tower pound was abolished in the 16th century. However, 240 pennyweights (24 grains) made one [[troy pound]] of silver in weight, and the monetary value of 240 pennies also became known as a "pound". The silver penny remained the primary unit of coinage for about 500 years.

|-
| 790 ||  Penny || 1.76g  || 95–96%  || Charlemagne new penny with smaller diameter but greater weight. Average weight of 1.7 g, but ideal theoretical{{clarify|date=July 2018}} mass of 1.76 g. Purity is from 95% to 96%.

|-
| 1527 '''?'''||  Penny||1.58g||  99%  || Tower pound of 5400 grains abolished and replaced by the Troy pound of 5760 grains.

|-
| 1158 ||  Penny ||    ||  92.5%  || The purity of 92.5% silver (i.e. sterling silver) was instituted by Henry II in 1158 with the "Tealby Penny" — a hammered coin.

|-
| 1500s ||  Penny ||    ||    || By the 16th century it contained about a third the silver content of a Troy pennyweight of 24 grains.

|-
| 1915 ||  Penny ||    ||    || A penny was worth around one-sixth of its value during the Middle Ages. British government sources suggest that prices have risen over 61-fold since 1914.

It is difficult to give even rough comparative values for money from before the 20th century, as the range of products and services available for purchase was so different. Classical historians often say that in the late [[Roman Republic]] and early [[Roman Empire]] (~27 BC) the daily wage for an unskilled laborer and common soldier was 1 denarius (with no tax deductions) or about US$2.80 in bread.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20130210071801/http://dougsmith.ancients.info/worth.html Buying Power of Ancient Coins] (amount has been adjusted for inflation)&lt;/ref&gt; During the republic (509–27 BC),{{when|date=September 2014}} legionary pay was 112.5 denarii per year (0.3 per day), later doubled by [[Julius Caesar]] to 225 denarii (0.6 per day), with soldiers having to pay for their own food and arms.{{Citation needed|date=September 2014}} [[Centurion]]s received considerably higher pay: under Augustus, the lowest rank of centurion was paid 3,750 denarii per year, and the highest rank, 15,000 denarii.{{Citation needed|date=September 2014}}

The silver content of the denarius under the Roman Empire (after [[Nero]]) was about 50 [[grain (measure)|grains]], 3.24 grams, or {{frac|1|10}} (0.105ozt) [[troy ounce]]. On June 6, 2011, this was about US$3.62 in value if the silver were 0.999 pure.

The fineness of the silver content varied with political and economic circumstances. From a purity of greater than 90% silver in the 1st century AD, the denarius fell to under 60% purity by the year 200, and plummeted to 5% purity by the year 300.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tulane.edu/~august/handouts/601cprin.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-12-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151128174101/http://www.tulane.edu/~august/handouts/601cprin.htm |archivedate=2015-11-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; By the reign of [[Gallienus]], the ''antoninianus'' was a copper coin with a thin silver wash.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Katsari|first=Constantina|title=The Concept of Inflation in the Roman Empire|year=2002|url=https://ideas.repec.org/p/wpa/wuwpeh/0204001.html|accessdate=2006-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By comparison, a laborer earning the [[minimum wage in the United States]] in January 2014 made US$58 for an 8-hour day, before taxes (based on the [[Mode (statistics)|mode value]] of $7.25 per hour, which was true{{clarify|date=July 2018}} then in 20 states) and an employee earning the [[minimum wage in the United Kingdom]] in 2014 made £52 for an 8-hour day, before taxes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dol.gov/whd/minwage/america.htm |title=United States Department of Labor—Wage and Hour Division (WHD)|publisher=www.dol.gov| accessdate=10 January 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.gov.uk/national-minimum-wage-rates |title=National Minimum Wage rates|publisher=www.gov.uk| accessdate=14 November 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Berwick-upon-Tweed]] --&gt;
In the final years of the 1st century BC [[Tincomarus]], a local ruler in southern Britain, started issuing coins that appear to have been made from melted down ''denarii''.&lt;ref name=jersey29&gt;{{cite book |last=De Jersey |first=Philip |date=1996 |title=Celtic Coinage in Britain |publisher=Shire Publications |pages=29–30 |isbn=0-7478-0325-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The coins of [[Eppillus]], issued around [[Calleva Atrebatum]] around the same time, appear to have derived design elements from various ''denarii'' such as those of [[Augustus]] and [[M. Volteius]].&lt;ref name=Beanmeth341&gt;{{cite thesis |last=Bean|first=Simon C|date=1994 |title=The coinage of Atrebates and Regni |type=Ph.D. |chapter=The coinage of Eppilus |pages=341–347|publisher=University of Nottingham |url=http://eprints.nottingham.ac.uk/11944/1/262143.pdf |access-date=14 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=jersey29 /&gt;

Even after the ''denarius'' was no longer regularly issued, it continued to be used as a unit of account, and the name was applied to later Roman coins in a way that is not understood. The [[Arab]]s who [[Muslim conquests|conquered large parts]] of the land that once belonged to the Eastern Roman Empire issued their own [[gold dinar]]. The lasting legacy of the ''denarius'' can be seen in the use of "d" as the abbreviation for the British [[penny]] until 1971.&lt;ref&gt;English Coinage 600–1900 by C.H.V. Sutherland 1973 {{ISBN|0-7134-0731-X}} p.10&lt;/ref&gt; It also survived in [[France]] as the name of a coin, the [[French denier|denier]]. The denarius also survives in the common Arabic name for a currency unit, the ''[[dinar]]'' used from pre-Islamic times, and still used in several modern Arab nations. The major currency unit in former [[Principality of Serbia]], [[Kingdom of Serbia]] and former [[Yugoslavia]] was ''[[dinar]]'', and it is still used in present-day [[Serbia]]. The [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonian]] currency ''[[Macedonian denar|denar]]'' is also derived from the Roman denarius. The [[Italian language|Italian]] word ''denaro'', the [[Spanish language|Spanish]] word ''dinero'', the [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] word ''dinheiro'', and the [[Slovene language|Slovene]] word ''{{lang|sl|denar}}'', all meaning money, are also derived from Latin ''denarius''.

==Use in the Bible==
In the [[New Testament]], the gospels refer to the denarius as a day's wage for a common laborer ([[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]] 20:2,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+20%3A2&amp;version=NIV |title=Matthew 20:2 NIV – He agreed to pay them a denarius |publisher=Bible Gateway |date= |accessdate=2013-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gospel of John|John]]  12:5).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=jn%2012:5;&amp;version=31 |title=Jn 12:5; NIV – "Why wasn’t this perfume sold ... |publisher=Bible Gateway |date= |accessdate=2013-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Book of Revelation]], during the Third Seal: Black Horse, a [[Ancient Greek units of measurement#Volume|choinix]] (or quart) of wheat and three quarts of barley were each valued at one denarius.&lt;ref&gt;Revelation 6:6&lt;/ref&gt; Bible scholar [[Robert H. Mounce]] says the price of the wheat and barley as described in the vision appears to be ten to twelve times their normal cost in ancient times.&lt;ref&gt;The New International Commentary on the New Testament, "The Book of Revelation," p.&amp;nbsp;155)&lt;/ref&gt; Revelation describes a condition where basic goods are sold at greatly inflated prices. Thus, the [[Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse|black horse rider]] depicts times of deep scarcity or famine but not of starvation. The English word "quart" translates choinix. Apparently, a choinix of wheat was the daily ration of one adult. Thus, in the conditions pictured by [[Revelation 6]] the normal income for a working-class family would buy enough food for only one person. The less costly barley would feed three people for one day's wages.

The denarius is also mentioned in the [[Parable of the Good Samaritan]] ([[Gospel of Luke|Luke]] 10:25–37) has also been commonly identified as the [[tribute penny]] held by Jesus in the [[Render unto Caesar]] passage [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]] 22:15–22 and [[Gospel of Mark|Mark]] 12:13–17.

'''Dry rot treatment''' refers to techniques used to eliminate [[dry rot]] fungus and alleviate the damage done by the fungus to human-built wooden structures.

Dry rot (''[[Serpula lacrymans]]'') is considered difficult to remove, requiring drastic action. Remedial timber treatment and damp proofing companies typically recommend stripping out of building fabric beyond the visible extent of the infestation and the use of fungicide. More holistic approaches attempt to eradicate dry rot by controlling the local environment to reduce timber moisture levels and increase ventilation in order to promote drying.

The first priority when treating dry rot is to find and remove the dampness within the building that caused the outbreak, and to promote drying out by taking measures, such as increasing ventilation. Treatment approaches differ after these steps are taken.

==Mycology of ''S. lacrymans''==
''S. lacrymans'' is a form of brown rot, a group of fungi which digest the [[cellulose]] and [[hemicellulose]] in timber.  This particular species poses the greatest threat to buildings since it can spread through non-nutrient providing materials (e.g., masonry and plaster) for several meters until it finds more timber to attack.&lt;ref name="Palfreyman &amp; Low 2002"&gt;Palfreyman, J. W. &amp; Low, G. (2002) "Studies of the Domestic Dry Rot Fungus Serpula Lacrymans With Relevance to the Management of Decay in Buildings", Edinburgh, Historic Scotland&lt;/ref&gt;

Dry rot is spread by spores which are present in most buildings. The minimum moisture content of timber for spore germination is 28&amp;ndash;30% (lower than other rots), and the relative humidity must be in excess of 95%. Spores are resistant to [[desiccation]] and may still be viable for germination when they are several years old.&lt;ref name="Ridout 2000"&gt;Ridout B. (2000) "Timber Decay in Buildings, The conservation approach to treatment", London, Spon&lt;/ref&gt;

If conditions are suitable, the spore will germinate producing microscopic fungal threads called hyphae.

'''Table 1.  Environmental conditions for mycelial growth following germination&lt;ref name="Ridout 2000"/&gt;'''

The average moisture content of modern softwood timbers in dry buildings is generally in the range of 12&amp;ndash;15%,&lt;ref name="Ridout 2000"/&gt; and heating systems may reduce this to a far lower level. There is, therefore, no prospect of a dry rot infestation developing in a building that has been properly designed, constructed, and maintained.

Once the environment starts to dry out, the rot will become dormant and eventually die. The length of time that the fungus can remain dormant under dry conditions seems to depend on the temperature, with approximate times of nine years at 7.5&amp;nbsp;°C and one year at 22&amp;nbsp;°C being quoted.&lt;ref name="Ridout 2000"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BRE 1993"&gt;Building Research Establishment (1993) ''BRE Digest'' 299 "Dry rot: its recognition and control", Watford, BRE&lt;/ref&gt;

Most fungi will only thrive in acid conditions, but dry rot will remain active in alkaline conditions. This gives it the ability to grow through damp mortar, masonry, and plaster, infecting other areas of the building.&lt;ref name="Ridout 1985"&gt;Ridout, B. (1985) "Dry Rot an Alternative Approach". ''Architect’s Journal''. 18 September 1985, pp. 69 - 72&lt;/ref&gt; Thick, conducting strands known as [[rhizomorphs]], are produced to cross inert surfaces and penetrate masonry.

A fruiting body ([[sporophore]]) may develop naturally or in response to unfavourable conditions of humidity, temperature or exhaustion of nutrients.&lt;ref name="Singh 1994"&gt;Lloyd, H. &amp; Singh, J. (1994) "Inspection, Monitoring and Environmental Control of Timber Decay". In: ''Building Mycology – Management of Decay and Health in Buildings'', ed. J. Singh, pp. 159 - 186 London, Spon&lt;/ref&gt; Often the stress that provokes this is the exposure of the infestation. The fruiting body will produce millions of rust brown spores.

One belief held about dry rot is that, once established, it can survive by producing water by breaking down the timber if the original source of water is removed. Laboratory experiments conducted in 1932 on timber samples in unventilated glass jars showed that significant quantities of water were indeed produced. However these experiments do not replicate the "real world" environment of a building where processes of evaporation and [[capillary action]] in the wood will be removing moisture from the area faster than it can be produced by the fungus.&lt;ref name="Ridout 2000"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ridout 1985"/&gt;

Another misconception is that dry rot can transport water from a source over considerable distances to an area of dry timber so that it can decay there.&lt;ref name="Berry 1994"&gt;Berry, R. W. (1994) ''Remedial Treatment of Wood Rot and Insect Attack in Buildings'', Watford, BRE&lt;/ref&gt; While the mycelium strands do conduct a nutrient solution around the fungus, it has been shown that any ability to transport water to "wet up" dry timber is very limited.&lt;ref name="Ridout 2000"/&gt;

Despite being a successful coloniser of buildings, for reasons that have not yet been fully explained, ''S. lacrymans'' is rarely found growing in the wild. Occasional specimens have been found in the foothills of the Indian Himalayas, Mt. Shasta in California, and woodlands in Czechoslovakia.&lt;ref name="Palfreyman &amp; Low 2002"/&gt;

==Treatment Methods==

===Introduction===

The first step in any course of treatment is to make the necessary repairs to the building defects (overflowing gutters, blocked airbricks, missing slates, etc.) that allowed the ingress of dampness. The treatment methods described below assume that the dry rot has been positively identified, the full extent of the rot ascertained, and that the building is now water tight.

A number of methods of attacking dry rot have been developed which can be classified as follows:

*	Orthodox – emphasis on the use of chemical fungicides
*	Environmental – emphasis on controlling the fungus by controlling environmental conditions
*	Heat treatment – exploiting the fungus’ sensitivity to heat
*	Biological treatment – use of competitor organisms

The latter two methods are included for completeness as they are currently not widely used. The main purpose of this article is to compare the orthodox and environmental approaches.

===“Orthodox” Treatment for Dry Rot===
The following description for the treatment of dry rot is typical of traditional methods:&lt;ref name="Hicken 1972"&gt;Hicken, N. (1972) ''The Dry Rot Problem'' 2nd Edition, London, Hutchinson &amp; Co.&lt;/ref&gt;

#	Cut out all wood showing decay, presence of white [[mycelium]], etc. and all apparently sound timber within a radius of one metre of the nearest visibly decayed timber. Burn all such material.
#	Hack off all plaster/render and remove any skirtings, panelling, linings and ceilings necessary to trace the fullest extent of the growth over or through adjacent masonry, concrete or timber surfaces.
#	Clean off with a wire brush all surfaces and any steel and pipe work within the area up to a radius of 1.5 metres from the furthest extent of suspected infection. Remove from the building all dust and debris ensuing from the work.
#	Apply [[fungicide]] to all such masonry, concrete and earth surfaces at the specified rate. Apply two generous coats of fungicide to all timber surfaces to a distance of 1.5 metres from the cutting away. (Allow first coat to be absorbed before applying second coat)
#	Use only fully preservative-treated timber for replacement.
#	Replaster with [[Zinc chloride hydroxide monohydrate|zinc oxychloride]] (ZOC) plaster or, for areas not to be replastered, apply two coats of ZOC paint.

As can be seen from stages 1 and 2, this involves the removal of a considerable quantity of building fabric.

The desire to kill the fungal strands within all materials adjoining the affected timber has led to the practice of "wall irrigation" at stage 4. This entails saturating the masonry with a water-soluble fungicide at a rate of about 10 litres/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.  Walls of more than half-brick thickness need to be drilled at {{convert|230|mm|in}} spacing to a depth of just over half the wall thickness. Walls of over {{convet460|mm|18|in}} thickness should be drilled from both sides. Fungicide is then injected into the holes, and the wall faces are sprayed.&lt;ref name="Shaw 1986"&gt;Shaw, G. et al. (1986) "Construction Risks and Remedies Timber Decay Part 2". ''Architect’s Journal''. 15 October 1986, pp. 69 - 83&lt;/ref&gt;

Ensuring thorough penetration of fungicide throughout the structure of a non-homogenous wall is extremely difficult. "There is no practical way of ensuring that all dry rot strands within a wall are killed."&lt;ref name="Hilditch 1994"&gt;Hilditch, E. A (1994) "Chemical Control of Fungal Decay in Buildings". In: ''Building Mycology – Management of Decay and Health in Buildings'', ed. J. Singh, pp. 212 - 238 London, Spon&lt;/ref&gt;

A more recent variation of the practice of wall irrigation is the "toxic box" where the area of irrigation is reduced to forming a margin around the perimeter of the wall thereby containing the fungus within the wall. Here it can do no harm and will eventually die for lack of food.&lt;ref name="Ridout 2000"/&gt;

Application of fungicides to the timber at stage 4 may be by brush, spray or injected under pressure into holes drilled into the wood. Preservatives based on organic solvents are used as these have better penetration into wood than water based solutions. Examples of suitable organic solvents include the following:    (--- please provide examples to improve this page.). Alternatively pastes consisting of a fungicide in an oil/water emulsion may be applied to the timber.

In addition to more conventional fungicides, [[boron]]-based fungicide can be supplied in glass-like rods which are inserted into holes drilled into the wood. Boron is commonly available as the laundry supplement Borax, and as boric acid which is commonly available from pharmacists or in cockroach pesticides. Boron rods are soluble and should the timber become damp the rod will gradually dissolve diffusing preservative into the damp area. Their use is particularly appropriate for areas that are at risk but not yet affected.&lt;ref name="Coleman 2005"&gt;Coleman, G.R. (2005) "Dry Rot and its Control [Internet], Remedial Technical Services". Available from: &lt;www.buildingpreservation.com&gt; [Accessed 18 January 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;  A [[surfactant]] (such as dish soap) is recommended in water-based preparations.  

It has been reported that boron fungicides react with the cellular structure of the wood whereby the boron is deposited, and it is this process which can to varying extents harden the dry rot, depending on the degree of degradation of the wood. However, structural members should be remediated by sistering in new wood after the fungus issue has been dealt with.  (Please confirm)

Boron/glycol preservatives consist of an inorganic boron preservative dissolved in a glycol to produce a paste. These are water-soluble and will readily diffuse into damp wood, even from the surface, and therefore offer better penetration than more conventional fungicide products, where it is necessary to penetrate damp wood.&lt;ref name="Coleman 2005"/&gt;

[[Diol|Glycol]] solutions have an advantage in that they can be applied over paint (please confirm).

Glycol and boron solutions are hydrophilic (water loving) and react with the water in wood, making it unavailable for the fungus. This is why dry rot can seem to be a little stringy; cells grown in dryer periods are smaller than the larger, 'plumper' cells that grow in spring, as can be seen in the trees rings used to tell how old the tree is. This moister spring growth contains the moisture the fungus consumes, in addition to that available from leaks, etc.

Water-based fungicides, because they are water-based, can be washed-away in time if the wood they are applied to keeps getting wet. This is another reason why it is important to fix leaks and keep the wood dry and with an alkaline environment, and seal the wood and especially the end grain to prevent ongoing exposure to hungry spores.

Fungicides to defeat brown rot include: [[Sodium bicarbonate|baking soda]], [[hydrogen peroxide]], [[tea tree oil]], boron solutions, [[ethylene glycol]] or [[propylene glycol]], vinegar, etc. Since the dry rot fungus requires an acidic environment from pH --- to --- (please provide info), certain of these fungicides work because they change the pH.

Recipes for homemade fungicide solutions and wood hardeners and penetrating epoxies have been reported on the web, in addition to commercially available products. (It would be appreciated if you could improve his page by providing information about tests showing the efficacy of different treatments.)

===“Environmental” treatment of dry rot===
The environmental approach can be defined as "the exploitation of the environmental sensitivity of the dry rot fungus for its treatment".&lt;ref name="Palfreyman, Low &amp; Urquhart 2002"&gt;Palfreyman, J. W. Low, G. &amp; Urquhart, D. (2002) "Technical Advice Note 24 – The Environmental Control of Dry Rot", Edinburgh, Historic Scotland&lt;/ref&gt;

A step-by-step procedure for using the environmental approach would be:
#	Promote the drying out of the affected areas (e.g., by introducing forced ventilation from fans). Do not re-plaster, redecorate or otherwise cover up affected timbers until thoroughly dried out.
#	Identify, with the assistance of a structural engineer where required, any timber that requires replacement or strengthening due to loss of structural strength and carry out these works. Retain as much original fabric as possible, especially in historic buildings.
#	Isolate timbers from other materials that will take a long time to dry out.
#	Increase the ventilation of the area if this is insufficient, by introducing extra air bricks etc.
#	Implement a regular schedule of inspection and maintenance for the building to tackle future problems early on and/or install monitoring equipment.

An example of the situation to which Stage 3 refers would be where a solid stone wall has become soaked due to a gutter becoming blocked and rainwater allowed to overflow down the wall for a period of time. Roof timbers may rest on top of the wall. Even when the ingress of water has been stopped and good ventilation established, it will take a considerable length of time for the wall to dry out. During this time, it is probable that there will be sufficient moisture present to allow fungal growth to continue. In this situation it will be necessary to isolate the timber from the masonry with DPC material.&lt;ref name="Singh 1999"&gt;Singh, J. (1999) "Dry Rot and Other Wood-Destroying Fungi: Their Occurrence, Biology, Pathology and Control". ''Indoor and Built Environment''. Vol. 8 No.3, pp. 3 - 20&lt;/ref&gt; Where the ends of timbers were originally built into a wall and have rotted, these may be cut off flush with the wall and reattached using joist hangers.&lt;ref name="Palfreyman, Low &amp; Urquhart 2002"/&gt;

Alternatively, the use of pastes and boron rods would be justified in this instance. "Preservative treatments may be essential in some situations if the spread of the fungus is to be restricted and critical timbers are to be protected while the structure dries." &lt;ref name="Ridout 2000"/&gt;

The environmental approach emphasises the need for continued monitoring to ensure that future building defects do not start a new outbreak of dry rot or reactivate a dormant one. While in a simple small building this may be accomplished by regular maintenance inspections, systems are available that can monitor a large building with readings from moisture sensors being remotely monitored by a computer.&lt;ref name="Singh 1994"/&gt;

===Heat treatment===
Other treatments have been tried that attempt to exploit the dry rot’s sensitivity to heat. The use of a blowlamp to kill dry rot by applying heat to the surface of affected areas was popular at one time. Obviously, this led to the risk of fire. Experiments showed that a surface temperature of about {{convert|100|C|F}} would have to be maintained for up to five hours in order to produce a temperature that would be lethal to fungus within a {{convert|230|mm|in}} thick wall.&lt;ref name="Ridout 2000"/&gt;

In Denmark, a procedure has been developed whereby the building, or the affected part thereof, is tented and heated by hot air to kill dry rot.&lt;ref name="Palfreyman &amp; White, 2003"&gt;Palfreyman, J. W. &amp; White, N.A. (2003)" Everything you wanted to know about the dry rot fungus but were afraid to ask." ''Microbiology Today''. Volume 30 August 2003, pp 107 - 109&lt;/ref&gt;  A temperature of {{convert|40|C|F}} is achieved at the centre of masonry and timbers and maintained for twenty-four hours. However, the question could be asked as to why someone should expend large amounts of energy heating the entire building to a high temperature when all that is needed to kill the rot is to dry it out.

A treatment system using microwaves has also been tried. Further research will be needed before its effectiveness can be assessed.&lt;ref name="Palfreyman et al. 1995"&gt;Palfreyman, J. W. White, N.A. Buultjens, T.E.J. &amp; Glancy, H. (1995) "The impact of current research on the treatment of infestations by the dry rot fungus Serpula Lacrymans." ''International Biodeterioration &amp; Biodegradation''. Volume 35 Issue 4, pp 369 - 395.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Biological Control===
A further possible way of combating dry rot is by the use of antagonistic organisms that reduce the ability of the decay fungus to colonise or degrade the wood.  The principle here is that when in a building the fungus is not in its natural environment and therefore natural competitors are unlikely to be present.  It may, however, be possible to introduce these competitors into the building environment to control the dry rot.&lt;ref name="Palfreyman et al. 1995"/&gt;

''Trichoderma'' fungi remove some structural carbohydrates from the wood necessary for the colonisation and initiation of decay by wood-destroying fungi,&lt;ref name="Singh 1999"/&gt; and laboratory tests have shown the ability of ''Trichoderma'' fungi to kill ''S. lacrymans''.&lt;ref name="Score &amp; Palfreyman 1994"&gt;Score, A. J. &amp; Palfreyman, J. W. (1994) Biological Control of the Dry Rot Fungus Serpula Lacrymans by Trichoderma Species. International Biodeterioration &amp; Biodegradation. Volume 33 Issue 2, pp 115 - 128.&lt;/ref&gt;  Field trials have also been carried out investigating the ability of ''Trichoderma'' fungi to prevent rot in electrical distribution poles, with mixed results.&lt;ref name="Palfreyman &amp; Bruce 1994"&gt;Palfreyman, J. W. &amp; Bruce, A. (1994) Detection and Biocontrol of Wood Decay Organisms. In: Building Mycology – Management of Decay and Health in Buildings, ed. J. Singh, pp. 187 - 211 London, Spon.&lt;/ref&gt;

This sort of biocontrol shows promise in the laboratory but is disappointing in the field,&lt;ref name="Palfreyman &amp; White, 2003"/&gt; and more work will need to be done.  As yet,{{When|date=September 2010}} biological control methods have not become established.

There are also issues with the allergenic potential of ''Trichoderma'' that may limit its use in situations where human contact is likely.&lt;ref name="Palfreyman et al. 1995"/&gt;

==Criticisms of the Orthodox Approach==
Proponents of the environmental approach argue that the drastic action of the orthodox approach is in line with the popular misconception that dry rot is extremely difficult to eradicate. Conversely, they would claim that it is not unusually resilient and is in fact very environmentally sensitive.&lt;ref name="Palfreyman &amp; White, 2003"/&gt;  Indeed, this environmental sensitivity may account for why it is so unsuccessful in the wild and may be used against it when encountered in buildings.

Perhaps the most criticised aspect of the orthodox approach is the practice of wall irrigation. As stated above, this entails introducing large quantities of water-based fungicide into the building fabric. But this is at a time when the primary concern should be to dry the building out.&lt;ref name="BRE 1993"/&gt;

Excessive water content in the wall will also cause a high risk of the [[efflorescence]] of salts out of the wall as it dries thereby damaging plaster and other finishes. Any such salts deposited on the wall surface may contain the fungicide used in the treatment, thereby creating a potential health hazard.&lt;ref name="Ridout, 2001"&gt;Ridout, B. (2001) Fungus the Bogeyman. Architect’s Journal. 1 March 2001, pp. 44 - 46.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ability of irrigation to kill all the fungus within the wall is also questionable, as thorough penetration of the fungicide throughout a non-homogeneous wall is unlikely, resulting in patchy treatment.&lt;ref name="Ridout 1985"/&gt; Case studies have been cited where dry rot has emerged from walls that had previously been "sterilised" by irrigation&amp;mdash;in one case, from a wall that had been treated twice before.&lt;ref name="Coleman 2000"&gt;Coleman, G.R. (2000) Dry Rot With an Attitude [Internet], Remedial Technical Services. Available from: &lt;www.buildingpreservation.com&gt; [Accessed 21 January 2008].&lt;/ref&gt;

It is questionable{{By whom|date=September 2010}} whether it is necessary to take steps to kill the fungus within the wall at all as the fungal strands are not causing damage to the masonry itself. Instead, they are merely passing through the wall in search of more timber to attack. The "toxic box" technique, as described above, confines the irrigation to the perimeter of the wall. Even the toxic box method has been found to be of limited use.&lt;ref name="Watt, Colston &amp; Spalding, 2000"&gt;Watt, D. Colston, B. &amp; Spalding, D. (2000) Research Papers - Assessing the Impact of Chemical Treatments on the Health of Buildings and their Occupants London, RICS Foundation.&lt;/ref&gt; The doubts about complete penetration of any masonry remain, so it is questionable whether a complete barrier of treated material can be formed around the edge of the wall.

The orthodox approach requires that all timbers left in place are protected by the application of a preservative fungicide. As with masonry, it is not easy to achieve full penetration of the timber. The penetration of surface sprays and conventional pastes is severely compromised by high moisture levels in wood. Injection techniques do force fluid within the timber, but distribution throughout the entire piece of wood can be patchy. The use of boron/glycol preservatives do show improved penetration.&lt;ref name="Coleman 2005"/&gt;

Another criticism of the orthodox approach is the sheer amount of building fabric that is removed and the consequent amount of remedial work and disruption to the use of the building. Wall irrigation requires the drilling of a large number of holes into masonry.

===Human Health Concerns===
One argument put forward by the supporters of the environmental approach concerns the potential effect on human health of the large quantities of toxic chemicals used in orthodox treatments. Typical quotations are: "chemical control methods cause extensive environmental degradation, pose potential hazards to wildlife and are of grave concern to public health bodies" &lt;ref name="Singh 1999"/&gt; and "…..many cases of illness including headaches, respiratory problems and chest pains, to name a few, have been linked to the use of such agents within buildings. Furthermore, clinical evaluation has tended to validate these concerns". &lt;ref name="Palfreyman &amp; Low 2002"/&gt;

However, others argue that none of the products employed over the last twenty to thirty years have been proven to be harmful to people when used properly.&lt;ref name="Hilditch 1994"/&gt; Furthermore, there is a major difference between the use of wood preservatives and pesticides in other situations, especially agriculture, as wood preservatives are put on and into the timber and are designed to stay there for 50 or more years.  Pesticides in agriculture, on the other hand, are released into an open environment.

Generally, the toxicity of the fungicides used by the industry has been reduced since 1991 with chemicals such as dieldrin, pentachlorophenol, and tributyltin oxide being replaced by organo-boron esters, permethrin, and boron/glycol mixes.  One way of comparing the toxicity of chemicals is by {{LD50}}, which gives the dose relative to bodyweight sufficient to kill 50% of the test population (usually rats).&lt;ref name="Coleman 1999"&gt;Coleman, G.R. (1999) Timber Preservatives in Perspective [Internet], Remedial Technical Services. Available from: &lt;www.buildingpreservation.com&gt; [Accessed 21 January 2008].&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Table 2.  Relative toxicities of chemicals&lt;ref name="Coleman 1999"/&gt;'''

Boron-based compounds are toxic to fungi, but their effects on mammals are minimal.&lt;ref name="Palfreyman, Low &amp; Urquhart 2002"/&gt; However, conventional wood preservatives consist of the active ingredient and a solvent, and it is the organic solvents that seem to give more cause for concern. No ill effects appear to be produced by limited exposure to hydrocarbon solvent vapour, but a higher degree of exposure may cause symptoms such as headaches and nausea, which disappear as soon as exposure ceases.&lt;ref name="Hilditch 1994"/&gt;

Some evidence has been produced recently that workers exposed to high levels of solvents over a number of years may develop damage to the central nervous system, but the studies have not been conclusive. This suggests that sufficient ventilation in the treated area until the product is dry is all that is required to prevent any discomfort from the solvent.&lt;ref name="Hilditch 1994"/&gt;

Dr. David Watt, in an article published in the ''Journal of Nutritional and Environmental Medicine'', is more cautious:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Chemical treatments used for the control or eradication of fungal infections and/or insect infestations in buildings and the residues of such treatments do not pose a proven hazard to the general population. There is, however, an apparent potential risk from such treatments and from the presence of treatment residues in treated buildings for persons who suffer from chemical sensitivity&amp;hellip; it is concluded that further investigation and evaluation is required of alternative chemical and non chemical treatments of fungal infections and/or insect infestations in buildings.&lt;ref name="Watt 2000"&gt;Watt, D. (2000) "Chemical Treatment Residues in Buildings: What are the Hazards and Risks?" ''Journal of Nutritional &amp; Environmental Medicine''. Vol.10 pp. 33 - 38
.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It should be noted that Watt treats the fungicide as a whole in his article: i.e., he does not separate out the effects of the active ingredients and the solvent.

===Environmental Concerns===
It has been stated that none of the treatment products used over the last twenty to thirty years have been proven to have caused any damage to the environment when properly used except in the isolated case of [[bat]]s.&lt;ref name="Hilditch 1994"/&gt; However, in the UK at least, this is a major consideration, as bats are protected under the [[Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981]], which states that harming them or disturbing their roosts is a criminal offence.&lt;ref name="Ridout 2000"/&gt;

Local damage to the environment will result when pesticides are discharged to the ground or rivers due to accident or dumping.&lt;ref name="Hilditch 1994"/&gt; Obviously, there is always the possibility that any chemical will not be used correctly, either through ignorance or malice, and the proponents of the environmental approach would argue that there is no need to use large quantities of chemicals anyway when there is a risk, however small.

==Effectiveness of Treatments==
Experience from companies involved in environmental control and research findings confirm that in most situations dry rot can be fully controlled simply by altering the environment in which it is growing.&lt;ref name="Palfreyman, Low &amp; Urquhart 2002"/&gt;  The Dry Rot Research Group at the University of Abertay have conducted laboratory trials of the environmental control of dry rot on full size models of a floor/wall junction, a window, and a roof/wall junction.&lt;ref name=" Palfreyman, Smith &amp; Low 2001"&gt;Palfreyman, J. W. Smith, D. &amp; Low, G.A. (2001) "The use of representative modelling to test the efficacy of environmental control treatments for the dry rot fungus Serpula Lacrymans." ''International Biodeterioration &amp; Biodegradation''. Volume 47 Issue 1, pp 27 - 36.&lt;/ref&gt; The full results are published in a research report by Historic Scotland&lt;ref name="Palfreyman &amp; Low 2002"/&gt; and conclusively show how the growth of dry rot can be controlled simply by varying the available moisture in the environment.

A case study of successful environmental control of dry rot in a large building is included as an appendix in Historic Scotland’s "Technical Advice Note 24".&lt;ref name="Palfreyman, Low &amp; Urquhart 2002"/&gt; Case studies are also quoted in Dr. Brian Ridout’s book ''Timber Decay in Buildings, The Conservation Approach to Treatment''.&lt;ref name="Ridout 2000"/&gt;

===Costs===
With all treatment methods, the costs of the repairs to rectify the building defects that permitted the ingress of moisture will be the same. The overall cost of using the environmental approach to the treatment of dry rot is likely to be less than the orthodox approach.&lt;ref name="Palfreyman, Low &amp; Urquhart 2002"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Clifford 2005"&gt;Clifford, N. (2005) "Time to Stop the Rot". ''Architect’s Journal''. 05 May 2005, pp. 40 - 42.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dr. Ridout quotes a case study where an initial quote for orthodox treatment of a building was £23,000 but subsequent treatment by environmental methods resulted in a saving of one third in remedial works and timber replacement.&lt;ref name="Ridout 2000"/&gt;  Where it is decided to install moisture monitoring equipment, this will represent an additional capital outlay.&lt;ref name="Palfreyman, Low &amp; Urquhart 2002"/&gt;

===Guarantees===
There is a perception amongst the general public that dry rot is difficult to eradicate.&lt;ref name="Krzyzanowski et al. 1999"&gt;Krzyzanowski, N. Oduyemi, K. Jack, N. Ross, N.M &amp; Palfreyman, J.W. (1999) "The management and control of Dry Rot: A survey of practitioners' views and experiences." ''Journal of Environmental Management''. Volume 57 Issue 3, pp. 143 - 154.&lt;/ref&gt;  It has "instilled fear and dread for centuries".&lt;ref name="Palfreyman &amp; White, 2003"/&gt; It is, therefore, not surprising that if a property owner is told that they have such a serious problem, they will expect that drastic action will be required to fix it.

It could be argued that, if a reputable and specialist contractor is employed to administer the orthodox treatment, this has the advantage of coming with the reassurance of a guarantee. Guarantees against the recurrence of dry rot started to be issued in the 1950s, covering treated timbers for a period of 20 years. This period was soon extended to 30 years.&lt;ref name="Ridout 2000"/&gt;

However, the usefulness of the guarantees has been questioned over the inclusion of clauses that exclude liability if the timber is allowed to get wet again during the guarantee period.

An example of the courts enforcing a guarantee is the case of ;;Ackerman v Protim Services;; (1988).&lt;ref name="Ackerman"&gt;Ackerman v Protim Services. [1988] 2 ELGR 259 CA.&lt;/ref&gt;  In this case, dry rot recurred in a [[bressummer]] some eight years after it had been treated for a previous outbreak. The 20-year guarantee issued by the treatment company had a clause that excluded liability if recurrence was due to "a failure to keep the property in a dry and weatherproof condition and in a good and proper state of maintenance”.

The UK Court of Appeal held that the guarantee was not invalidated by this clause because the wall into which the timber was built was damp due to the nature of the construction of the building, not through any lapse in maintenance by the owners. But the clear implication of this is that if the timber had become wet because the property owners had not maintained the building properly, then the guarantee would have become void. In other words, the client is protected against the recurrence of dry rot provided that the conditions that allow dry rot to occur do not recur.

Graham Coleman, a leading specialist in damp treatment and timber decay, makes the same point on his website:

&lt;blockquote&gt;But then dry wood doesn't rot - so what is actually being 'guaranteed? Certainly not any chemical treatment that has been applied since it is clearly implied that if treated timber becomes damp it will rot. So what was the value of the preservative treatment? Obviously none!&lt;ref name=" Coleman 2002"&gt;Coleman, G.R. (2002) Dry Rot Guarantees – Any Practical Value? [Internet], Remedial Technical Services. Available from: &lt;www.buildingpreservation.com&gt; [Accessed 21 January 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Guarantees are therefore of questionable value and may be difficult to enforce.  However, the point will still be raised that if the fungicide treatment is really effective, it should not matter whether or not the treated timber gets wet again.  If, on the other hand, a fungicide-treated piece of timber must be kept dry to stop it rotting, it cannot be much more resistant to rot than wood that has not been treated.

In fact, guarantees for chemical dry rot treatments may be harmful as they may lure the building owners into a false sense of security by allowing them to feel that they can afford to be less diligent with property maintenance.

==Historic Buildings==
Richard Oxley of Oxley Conservation states that many remedial timber treatment companies simply do not know enough about the construction of historic buildings to be in a position to advise on appropriate repairs and treatments. He has experience of irreparable damage being done through such lack of knowledge &lt;ref name=" Oxley 1995"&gt;Oxley, R (1995) "Ignore it and it will go away! The problem of uncontrolled and unnecessary remedial damp and timber treatment in historic buildings." ''RICS Building Conservation Journal''. No. 13, Winter 1995&lt;/ref&gt; (Oxley, 1995) as does Dr Ridout.&lt;ref name="Ridout 2000"/&gt;

The methods and approaches used to assess and repair timbers in historic buildings have changed considerably in recent years, with a move away from wall irrigation, damage to decorative features during invasive survey work, and unnecessary cutting out or chemical treatment of timbers.&lt;ref name="Williams 2006"&gt;Williams, J. (2006) "Timber in historic buildings in the UK." ''The Structural Engineer''. Vol.84, Issue 17 pp 10 - 14&lt;/ref&gt;

With its emphasis on reducing the amount of building fabric to be removed, the environmental approach obviously has attractions for heritage organisations whose primary purpose is to preserve buildings.  Many of these organisations support the environmental approach, for example Dr. Brian Ridout’s book ''Timber Decay in Buildings, The Conservation Approach to Treatment'' being jointly published by English Heritage and Historic Scotland.&lt;ref name="Ridout 2000"/&gt;  Historic Scotland’s "Technical Advice Note 24"&lt;ref name="Palfreyman, Low &amp; Urquhart 2002"/&gt; advocates the use of environmental treatment of dry rot, as does advice on the Society for the Preservation of Ancient Building's website.&lt;ref name="SPAB 2007"&gt;SPAB (2007) Advice &amp; Guidance – Timber Decay [Internet], Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings. Available from: &lt;www.maintainyourbuilding.org.uk/pages/timber_decay.html &gt;[Accessed 22 January 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[sewing]] and patternmaking, '''ease''' is the amount of room a garment allows the wearer beyond the measurements of their body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url =https://butterick.mccall.com/size-fit-charts/ease-chart | title=Ease Chart | website=butterick.mccall.com | access-date=28 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, if a man has a 40-inch [[chest]] measurement, a jacket with a 40-inch chest would be very tight and would constrict movement. An ease of 3 or 4 inches might be added to the [[Pattern (sewing)|pattern]] (making a 43-44 inch chest), or more to enhance comfort or style. Ease is not generally included in sizing measurements. To use the example again, a man with a 40-inch chest will likely buy a jacket advertised as size 40, but the actual measurements of the garment will almost always be somewhat larger.

Ease is most important for woven garments cut on the straight or crossgrain, allowing little or no stretch.

A sloper pattern or block pattern is a simple pattern with very little or no ease made for the purpose of fitting the body accurately, from which more finished or stylized patterns may be developed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Joseph-Armstrong|first1=Helen|title=Patternmaking for Fashion Design Fifth Edition|date=2010|publisher=Pearson}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Adding ease==
Several techniques can be used to add ease to a pattern. The simplest may be to add width to the pattern pieces, such as at the side seams. Pleats or gathers may also be used. Reducing the intake of darts will also add ease.

==Contouring==
Contouring is the process of fitting a pattern to the body more nearly than the sloper, but it is not the same as removing ease. Contouring removes extra space ''within'' the measurements of the wearer. For example, a dress sloper will span the bust points, but a more fitted or 'contoured' bodice may dip toward the breastbone in between the breasts and fit each breast more closely, possibly even supporting each with [[Bone (corsetry)|boning]]. Contouring techniques can also be applied to other concave parts of the body which may be spanned by the sloper, such as the underside of the buttocks, or the knee area for pants.

==Controversies==

===Fictional columnist Burt Gertson===
On September 29, 2016, Burt Gertson, who was listed as one of FanSided’s writers, got into a Twitter argument with former adult film actress [[Mia Khalifa]], who at the time was a regular sports columnist at FanSided. It soon turned out that Gertson was not a real person despite initial claims by FanSided former Editor-in-Chief Jim Cavan. Shortly after, FanSided admitted in a series of tweets that Gertson was not real and his column was meant to be fictional satire.&lt;ref&gt;Laird, Sam [https://mashable.com/2016/09/30/fansided-mia-khalifa-burt-gertson/#ayRatDSS5gqf "The strange saga of the ex-porn star and the fake sports columnist"], ''Mashable'', September 30, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; FanSided issued a statement on October 1, 2016 announcing that it had fired Cavan.&lt;ref&gt;Lombardi, Matt

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3094">In [[linguistics]], a '''genus''' is a group of phylogenetically related languages inside a [[linguistic family]], in particular a genus is a group languages which can be recognized as related languages without using complex methods of [[historical linguistics]]. The notion of genus was proposed by M. Dryer,&lt;ref&gt;Dryer, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt; and is used commonly in some academic projects such as: [[World Atlas of Language Structures|WALS]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://wals.info/languoid/genealogy Genealogical Language List (WALS)]&lt;/ref&gt; According to WALS most families can be subdivided into a certain number of genera, so the notion is similar to the term subfamily.

== Introduction ==

=== Language families ===
Since the 18th century, linguists have classified languages according to [[phylogenesis|phylogenetic criteria]]. Before the 18th century, the common origins of [[Germanic languages]] or [[Slavic languages]] had been recognized. Many authors hypothesized that each of these language groups derived from a common "mother language" (in a similar way in which [[Romance languages]] derive historically from [[Latin]]). The philologists of the 19th century called a group of related languages a "family of sister languages" (generalizing the genealogical metaphor). When a "mother language" is undocumented, but can be partially reconstructed from its "daughter languages", one refers to this language as a [[proto-language]].

With the development of [[comparative linguistics]] and the establishment of [[historical linguistics]] as a scientific discipline, more "language families" were recognized, and more proto-languages were proposed.

=== Lack of comparability ===
There are some problems when one tries to compare language families. Some families are huge, and their proto-languages were spoken several millennia ago, but other families are tiny and their ancestor languages seem to have been spoken more recently. Indeed, the establishment of an accepted language family depends on the quality of the documentation and the amount of comparative work done in each group of languages. Obviously, the languages of Europe were well known in the 19th century, and the [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European language family]] was well-established early on. As to the remainder of the world languages, in the 19th century only a few language families were identified, often in an incomplete manner (the [[Bantu languages|Bantu]] and [[Malayo-Polynesian languages]] were recognized as groups of related languages, but not the [[Niger–Congo languages|Niger–Congo]] or [[Austronesian languages]]).

=== Genera ===
On the other hand, all the genera are internally much more homogeneous than language families. In addition, most language genera seem to involve more or less the same time depth. For these reason, genera are much more suitable for typological comparison than language families.

The '''''Goddess of Democracy''''', also known as the '''''Goddess of Democracy and Freedom''''', the '''''Spirit of Democracy''''',&lt;ref name="MacF"&gt;{{cite book|title= The Politics of China: The Eras of Mao and Deng|author=Roderick MacFarquhar|publisher=University of Cambridge|location=Cambridge, UK|year=1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the '''''Goddess of Liberty''''' (自由女神; ''zìyóu nǚshén''&lt;ref name="MacF"/&gt;), was a 10-metre-tall (33&amp;nbsp;ft) statue created during the [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989]].  The statue was constructed in only four days out of [[Extruded polystyrene|foam]] and [[papier-mâché]] over a metal [[Armature (sculpture)|armature]]. The constructors decided to make the statue as large as possible to try to dissuade the government from dismantling it: the government would either have to destroy the statue—an action which would potentially fuel further criticism of its policies—or leave it standing.  Nevertheless, the statue was destroyed on June 4, 1989, by [[People's Liberation Army at Tiananmen Square protests of 1989|soldiers clearing the protesters from Tiananmen square]]. Since its destruction, numerous replicas and memorials have been erected around the world, including in [[Hong Kong]] and [[Washington, D.C.]]

==Construction==

Near the end of May 1989 the Democracy Movement in Tiananmen Square, though still attracting huge throngs of participants, was losing momentum in the face of government inaction on reforms. One historian said the movement "appeared to have sunk to its nadir. The number of students in the Square continued to decline. Those remaining seemed to have no clear leadership: [[Chai Ling]], tired and disheartened by the difficulties of keeping the Movement together, had resigned from her post...[the Square] had degenerated into a shantytown, strewn with litter and permeated by the stench of garbage and overflowing portable toilets... Tianamen, once a magnet pulling in huge throngs, had become only an unkempt campground of little interest to citizens, many of whom considered the struggle for democracy lost."&lt;ref name="Han"/&gt; It was at this point that the reveal of the statue of the Goddess of Democracy reinvigorated the movement in the Square.

The statue was built by students of the [[Central Academy of Fine Arts]] beginning on May 27 at their University. It was built in hopes of bolstering the movement which "seemed to be losing some of its momentum; the students suspected that the government was waiting for them to tire and leave the Square".&lt;ref name="Tsao"/&gt; Working with a sense of urgency and expedience,&lt;ref name="Tsao"/&gt; to create the model the larger statue would be based on the students reworked an academic exercise  built to demonstrate the effect of the distribution of weight on a piece: "a half-meter high clay sculpture of a man grasping a pole with two raised hands and leaning his weight on it."&lt;ref name="Tsao"/&gt; "The students cut off the lower part of the pole and added a flame at the top to turn it into a torch; they leaned the sculpture into a more upright position;  they changed the man's face to a woman's, and otherwise added feminine characteristics to make the him into a her."&lt;ref name="Tsao"/&gt; They then transferred the measurements of the model, adjusting them for the larger proportion, to the foam that once carved became the monument.&lt;ref name="Tsao"/&gt; [[Jeff Widener]], known for his iconic [[Tank Man]] photograph, took other photographs of the fateful rally, including two widely publicized images of the ''Goddess''; one under construction, and another in context of the demonstration.

While many people have noted its resemblance to the [[Statue of Liberty]], a sculptor present during its construction, Tsao Tsing-yuan, has written that the students decided ''not'' to model their statue on the Statue of Liberty because they were concerned that it would be unoriginal and "too openly pro-American." Tsao further notes the influence on the statue of the work of Russian sculptor [[Vera Mukhina]], associated with the school of [[Socialist realism|revolutionary realism]]. Her piece ''[[Worker and Kolkhoz Woman]]'' was especially influential for their statue's head and facial features.&lt;ref name="Tsao"&gt;{{cite book|author=Tsao Tsing-yuan|title=Essay "The Birth of the Goddess of Democracy" from ''Popular Protest and Political Culture in Modern China''|editor=Jeffrey N. Wasserstrom and Elizabeth J. Perry|pages=140–47|location=Boulder, Col.|publisher=Westview Press|year=1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Russia-2000-stamp-Tatlin Tower and Worker and Kolkhoz Woman by Vera Mukhina.jpg|thumb|Vera Mukhina's ''[[Worker and Kolkhoz Woman]]'' sculpture (seen on a Russian stamp here on the right) influenced the creators of the ''Goddess of Democracy'']]

When the time came to transport the pieces of the statue to the Square, the State Security Bureau, hearing of the students' intention, declared that any truck drivers assisting them would lose their licenses. The students hired six Beijing carts (similar to a bicycle [[Cycle rickshaw|rickshaw]] except with a flat cart instead of a passenger area). Four carried the statue segments, and two carried the tools required to install it. The students had leaked a false itinerary of the move to throw off the authorities and moved the statue's three segments from the Central Academy of Fine Arts to the Square by another route. Students of the other academies assisting in the construction linked arms around the carts for protection in case the authorities arrived.&lt;ref name="Han"&gt;{{cite book|title=Cries For Democracy: Writings and Speeches from the 1989 Chinese Democracy Movement|author=Minzhu Han|year=1990|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Oxford, England}}&lt;/ref&gt; At dusk on May 29, with fewer than 10,000 protesters remaining in the square the Art Students constructed [[bamboo scaffolding]] and then began assembling the statue.&lt;ref name="MacF"/&gt; Troops called in to disrupt the movement and construction of the statue were "stalled ''en route'' by Beijing residents."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=China in the 1990s|author=Robert Benwick|year=1995|publisher=Macmillan Press Ltd.|location=Vancouver, Canada}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the early morning of May 30, the statue was fully assembled in [[Tiananmen Square]]. It broke up the north-south axis of the Square, standing between the [[Monument to the People's Heroes]], and the [[Tiananmen Gate]] (which it faced looking at its large photograph of [[Mao Zedong]]). Whether the students had intended it or not "dozens of television cameras expertly framed the ironic, silent confrontation between Goddess and Chairman."&lt;ref name="MacF"/&gt; When the time came for the actual unveiling, On May 30, 1989, two Beijing residents, a woman and a man, were chosen at random from the crowd and invited into the circle to pull the strings that would remove the pieces of red and blue cloth. The crowd burst into cheers and shouted slogans such as "Long live democracy!"&lt;ref name="Han"/&gt;

With the construction of the statue "The students, their flagging spirits revived, announced their determination to continue occupying the Square."&lt;ref name="MacF"/&gt; While there had been just 10,000 people in the square on the 29th, with its unveiling "As many as 300,000 spectators flocked to the square on 30–31."&lt;ref name="MacF"/&gt;  As one historian relates, "...a crudely sculpted thirty-three-foot high statue would bestow the struggle for democracy with a memorable symbol. ...it attracted thousands of spectators to the Square and angered the authorities, who condemned it as an "illegal, permanent" structure that would have to be torn down."&lt;ref name="Han"/&gt;

==Statement by its creators==
The art students who created the statue wrote a declaration that said in part:{{quote|At this grim moment, what we need most is to remain calm and united in a single purpose. We need a powerful cementing force to strengthen our resolve: That is the Goddess of Democracy. Democracy...You are the symbol of every student in the Square, of the hearts of millions of people. ...Today, here in the People’s Square, the people’s Goddess stands tall and announces to the whole world: A consciousness of democracy has awakened among the Chinese people! The new era has begun! ...The statue of the Goddess of Democracy is made of plaster, and of course cannot stand here forever. But as the symbol of the people’s hearts, she is divine and inviolate. Let those who would sully her beware: the people will not permit this! ...On the day when real democracy and freedom come to China, we must erect another Goddess of Democracy here in the Square, monumental, towering, and permanent. We have strong faith that that day will come at last. We have still another hope: Chinese people, arise! Erect the statue of the Goddess of Democracy in your millions of hearts! Long live the people! Long live freedom! Long live democracy!"&lt;ref name="Han"/&gt;}}

The document was signed by the eight art academies that sponsored the creation of the statue: The Central Academies of Fine Arts, Arts and Crafts, Drama, and Music; the Beijing Film Academy; the Beijing Dance Academy; the Academy of Chinese Local Stage Arts; and the Academy of Traditional Music.&lt;ref name="Han"/&gt;

The entire statement was written "in rather crude calligraphy" on a long banner placed near the statue, and was read in its entirety by a female student "with a good Mandarin accent" from the Broadcasting Academy.&lt;ref name="Tsao"/&gt;

==Democracy University==
{{unreferenced|section|date=May 2017}}
On June 3 even as the government troops positioned themselves to move on the students, applause erupted from the people gathered around the statue as it was announced there that a Democracy University would now begin classes in the Square with Zhang Boli appointed as its President. Even as classes began by the statue, to the west of the square and at Muxidi thousands of students moved to block the oncoming 27th Army who were armed with tanks, assault weapons, and bayonets. Blood was spilled by 10:30&amp;nbsp;p.m.

==Fall of the ''Goddess''==
The soldiers were able to fulfill their timeline of reaching the Square on June 4, 1989 by 1 a.m. through the use of tanks and armored personnel carriers. The ''Goddess of Democracy'' had stood for only five days before being destroyed by soldiers of the [[People's Liberation Army]] in the assault on Tiananmen that would end the Democracy Movement.&lt;ref name="Tsao"/&gt; The toppling of the ''Goddess of Democracy'' was seen by millions across the world on television: “pushed by a tank, it fell forward and to the right, so that its hands and the torch struck the ground first, breaking off."&lt;ref name="Tsao"/&gt; As the statue fell, protestors shouted "Down with Fascism!" and "Bandits! Bandits!"&lt;ref name="Lewis"&gt;{{cite book|title=China: Its History and Culture|author=Charlton M. Lewis, W. Scott Morton|year=1995|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=New York, NY}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was "quickly and easily reduced to rubble, mixing with all the other rubble in the Square. To be cleared away by the Army".&lt;ref name="Tsao"/&gt; By 5:40&amp;nbsp;a.m. a negotiated settlement allowed the remaining students to leave by the south-eastern corner of the square. The army had fulfilled its order to clear the Square by 6:00 a.m. Clashes continued throughout the city and in other towns across China.&lt;ref name="Lewis"/&gt;

==Replicas==
[[File:Goddess of Democracy DC side.jpg|thumb|[[Victims of Communism Memorial]] in Washington, D.C., recreation by Thomas Marsh]]
The original statue has become an icon of [[liberty]] and a symbol of the [[free speech]] and [[World Movement for Democracy|democracy movements]].&lt;ref name="DC" /&gt; The Chinese government has tried to distance itself from any discussions about the original statue or about the Tiananmen Square protests, and in the case of the [[Victims of Communism Memorial]] it called the building of a replica an "attempt to defame China."&lt;ref name="DC"&gt;{{cite news|title=New DC memorial dedicated to communism's victims|publisher=Chicago Tribune|author=Leora Falk|date=June 12, 2007|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/chi-070612monuments,1,2433167.story?coll=chi-newsnationworld-hed}}{{dead link|date=October 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several replicas of the statue have been erected worldwide to commemorate the events of 1989:
*A replica erected at a vigil attended by tens of thousands of people in [[Victoria Park, Hong Kong]] on June 4, 1996.
*A [[Goddess of Democracy (San Francisco)|bronze sculpture]] was begun in 1989, dedicated in 1994, by Thomas Marsh, leading a group of volunteers. Standing in [[Portsmouth Square]], in [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]]'s [[Chinatown, San Francisco|Chinatown]], it weighs approximately 600 pounds (272&amp;nbsp;kg) and bears the inscription, "Dedicated to Those Who Strive For and Cherish Human Rights and Democracy."
*A copy at the [[University of British Columbia]], erected by the school's Alma Mater Society.
*A gilded replica stood in the foyer of the Student Centre at [[York University]] in Toronto, Ontario. It was removed in 2011 (allegedly due to its deteriorating condition) and replaced outdoors by a smaller bronze replica outside the Student Centre in June 2012.&lt;ref name=YFile&gt;(Jun. 5, 2012) [http://yfile.news.yorku.ca/2012/06/05/goddess-of-democracy-unveiled/ "‘Goddess of Democracy’ unveiled"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120606225514/http://yfile.news.yorku.ca/2012/06/05/goddess-of-democracy-unveiled/ |date=June 6, 2012 }}, ''YFile''&lt;/ref&gt;
*A replica of the San Francisco statue was erected in an outdoor museum in [[Freedom Park (Arlington, Virginia)|Freedom Park]] [[Arlington, Virginia]] to commemorate the [[10th anniversary of Tiananmen Square protests of 1989|tenth anniversary of the protests]].&lt;ref name=coast&gt;Snyder, Charles (Jun. 5, 1999) [http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?pp_cat=&amp;art_id=30147&amp;sid=&amp;con_type=1&amp;d_str=19990605&amp;sear_year=1999 "Crackdown remembered from coast to coast"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629172646/http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?pp_cat=&amp;art_id=30147&amp;sid=&amp;con_type=1&amp;d_str=19990605&amp;sear_year=1999 |date=June 29, 2011 }}, ''The Standard''&lt;/ref&gt;
*An unknown artist's [[fiberglass]] copy was erected at the [[University of Calgary]] in 1995, commemorating  students who died in the uprisings six years earlier.
*A [[lantern]] [[sculpture]] of a figure wearing [[Taiwanese aboriginal|native Taiwanese dress]], but standing in a two-handed torch-bearing pose recalling the ''Goddess of Democracy'', was erected in advance of the 2009 [[World Games]] in [[Kaohsiung]], [[Taiwan]]. The start of the games coincided with the twentieth anniversary of the events in China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/thompson/2848718543/ |title=Lifting the Lamp &amp;#124; Flickr – Condivisione di foto! |publisher=Flickr.com |date= |accessdate=2013-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Two small-scale replicas were built and set up in Hong Kong in 2010 for the Tiananmen Square protests memorial gatherings, but were confiscated by the Hong Kong Police Force after a public display at [[Times Square, Hong Kong|Times Square]] Public Space. It was subsequently returned due to serious public opinion pressure, and was displayed at the vigil on June 4, 2010 at [[Victoria Park, Hong Kong|Victoria Park]]. After the candle night memorial gathering, the new 3-meter bronze statue of the Goddess of Democracy was moved to the Chinese University of Hong Kong campus for permanent display at its entrance of University Train Station. The erection of this bronze statue of the ''Goddess of Democracy'' was not approved by the university administration but 2000 Chinese university students, staff and alum with many other Hong Kong citizen worked together after the Victoria Park gathering to guard the statue to move to Chinese University campus.
*The Democracy Award&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ned.org/events/democracy-award |title=Democracy Award &amp;#124; National Endowment for Democracy |publisher=Ned.org |date= |accessdate=2013-05-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130602161747/http://www.ned.org/events/democracy-award |archivedate=June 2, 2013 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; given by the [[National Endowment for Democracy]] is a small-scale replica of the ''Goddess of Democracy''.
*A 3-meter bronze replica, [[Victims of Communism Memorial]], is in Washington, D.C..
*An [[augmented reality]] version of the statue created by the artists collective 4Gentlemen, part of Tiananmen SquARed, a two part augmented reality public art project and memorial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://manifestarblog.wordpress.com/ica/4gentlemen/ |title=4Gentlemen &amp;#124; Manifest.AR |publisher=Manifestarblog.wordpress.com |date=June 4, 1989 |accessdate=2013-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tsao Tsing-yuan, an advisor to the students who built the original, writes "I myself envision a day when another replica, as large as the original and more permanent, stands in Tiananmen Square, with the names of those who died there written in gold on its base. It may  well stand there after the [[Mausoleum of Mao Zedong|Chairman Mao's Mausoleum]] has, in its turn, been pulled down."&lt;ref name="Tsao"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2351">The '''hypotrachelium''' is the upper part or groove in the shaft of a [[Doric column]], beneath the [[trachelium (architecture)|trachelium]]. The Greek form is ''hypotrakhelion''.&lt;ref name="davies-jokiniemi-2012"/&gt;

In [[classical architecture]], it is the space between the [[Annulet (architecture)|annulet]] of the [[Echinus (molding)|echinus]] and the upper bed of the shafts, including, according to [[C. R. Cockerell]], the three grooves or sinkings found in some of the older examples, as in the [[Second Temple of Hera (Paestum)|temple of Neptune]] at [[Paestum]] and the [[temple of Aphaea]] at [[Aegina]]; there being only one groove in the [[Parthenon]], the [[Theseum]] and later examples. In the [[Ceres_(mythology)#Temples|temple of Ceres]] and the so-called [[Basilica]] at [[Paestum#Historic buildings|Paestum]] the hypotrachelium consists of a concave sinking carved with vertical lines suggestive of leaves, the tops of which project forward. A similar decoration is found in the capital of the columns flanking the [[tomb of Agamemnon]] at [[Mycenae]], but here the hypotrachelium projects forward with a [[cavetto]] moulding, and is carved with triple leaves like the buds of a rose.

In the [[Roman doric order]] the term was sometimes applied to that which is generally known as the "necking," the space between the fillet and the annulet.

The hypotrachelium was also called a '''collarino''', or '''colarino''', or '''colarin'''.

'''''If I Stay''''' is a 2014 American [[Teen film|teen]] [[Romantic drama film|romantic drama]] film directed by [[R. J. Cutler]] and based on the [[If I Stay|2009 novel of the same name]] by [[Gayle Forman]].

== Plot ==
Mia Hall and her family are getting ready to go on with their normal day activities when it is announced on the radio that school has been canceled. Mia's dad Denny is a teacher and as a result of the snow day does not have to go to work. Mia's mom Kat, a travel agent, decides to call in sick and along with her family get on the road to visit Mia's grandparents who live on a farm. It is also revealed that Mia is dating an older, popular up-and-coming rockstar named Adam Wilde.

The story flashes back to Mia's early life with a rocker dad and an inexperienced mom, when one day they take Mia to a music class where Mia decides that she wants to start playing the cello. After her parents see that Mia is passionate about the cello, they hire a teacher to help her play. Kat is shown pregnant with Teddy, whom Mia thinks is the reason for her father's departure from his band.

Years later, an adolescent Mia is still passionate about the cello and is playing at school in the band room where Adam peeks in on her playing, seeing her for the first time, leading him to ask Kim, Mia's best friend, about her. Adam then asks Mia out on a date to a cello recital, where they show mutual affection towards one another.

The story flashes back to current time with the family driving to the grandparents' farm when their car collides with an oncoming truck. Mia appears to have an [[out-of-body experience]] where she finds herself barefoot and sees her body lying on the road while paramedics are trying to help her and her family. Mia tries to ask a paramedic what is happening, but realizes that no one can see or hear her. Mia, now in the hospital, panics as she does not know the current status of any of her family members when they take her in for surgery. A sympathetic nurse, Nurse Ramirez, tells Mia—her physical body, not Mia's spirit, which apparently she cannot see either—that it is up to her whether or not she wants to stay.

The story flashes back once again to Mia attending one of Adam's concerts with his band Willamette Stone, where she does not seem to fit in. Adam's band is steadily gaining more recognition and gets signed to a label, which starts to put a strain on their relationship due to the travel schedule. While at dinner, Mia's grandpa suggests that she should apply to [[Juilliard School|Juilliard]], an idea which she initially rebuffs, but later further researches. She eventually lands an audition in [[San Francisco]]. It takes a while for Mia to tell Adam about her audition and when she does he becomes upset and leaves for a week-long gig.

In the present day, Mia undergoes surgery. She sees a doctor speaking with her grandparents who are standing outside of a pediatric room where Teddy lies in a coma-like state. Adam comes to the hospital to see Mia, but is not allowed in as he is not an immediate family member. It is then revealed that Mia's mom Kat was pronounced [[dead on arrival]] and her dad Denny died on the operating table. She later finds out that Teddy has died from an [[epidural hematoma]]. Grandpa talks to Mia, revealing that her father gave up being in a band because he wanted to give her a better life and be a better father. He also, tearfully, gives Mia permission to move on from this life if she wants, which influences Mia to decide that she wants to die so that she can join her family on the other side.

The story flashes back to Mia at her audition for Juilliard, where she plays the best she has ever played, leading her to think that if accepted, she would go. After a reconciliation with Adam, they talk about the huge possibility of her going to Juilliard, which ultimately leads to them breaking up and going their separate ways.

After some time, Mia seems stable enough to receive more visitors. Mia is shown symbolically about to let go when she hears the music performed at the cello recital that she attended with Adam. It is revealed that Adam has come to see Mia and that he is playing his [[iPod]] for her. He brings with him a letter Mia has received from Juilliard saying that she has been accepted and lets her know that he would do whatever she wants if she stays. He begins to play the song he has finally written about her. Mia, after flashing back through all the happy moments in her life, squeezes Adam's hand and opens her eyes and sees Adam as he hovers over her and says, "Mia?".

=== Critical response ===
On [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film has a rating of 35%, based on 122 reviews. The site's critical consensus reads, "Although Chloë Grace Moretz gives it her all and the story adds an intriguing supernatural twist to its melodramatic [[young adult fiction]] framework, ''If I Stay'' is ultimately more manipulative than moving".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/if_i_stay/|title=Rotten Tomatoes: If I Stay|date=August 22, 2014|publisher=|accessdate=November 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On [[Metacritic]], the film holds a score of 46 out of 100, based on 36 critics, indicating "mixed or average reviews".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/if-i-stay|title=Metacritic: If I Stay|publisher=|accessdate=October 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his review for ''[[The New York Times]]'', A.O. Scott praised Moretz's acting.&lt;ref name="nytimes"&gt;A.O. Scott, [https://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/22/movies/if-i-stay-weighs-teenagers-prospects-after-horrific-crash.html?_r=0 In Limbo, and in Love], ''The New York Times'', August 21, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; He added that the "music is both the best and the corniest part of ''If I Stay'', which makes excellent use of the classical cello repertoire."&lt;ref name="nytimes"/&gt;

Writing for ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'', Justin Chang criticized Moretz's acting, explaining that "she comes off as a bit too self-assured to play the nerdy misfit."&lt;ref name="variety review"&gt;Justin Chang, [https://variety.com/2014/film/reviews/film-review-if-i-stay-1201283269/ Film Review: ‘If I Stay’], ''Variety'', August 13, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

Anthony Lane of ''[[The New Yorker]]'' wrote a critical review of the movie, saying, "The saddest thing about 'If I Stay' is that it affords Moretz so little opportunity to be non-sad." In the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', Olivier Gettell summed up that critics saw the film was "clunky and uninspired."&lt;ref name="latimes"&gt;Oliver Gettell, [http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/moviesnow/la-et-mn-if-i-stay-chloe-grace-moretz-movie-reviews-critics-20140821-story.html], ''The Los Angeles Times'', August 21, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1970">'''Infiltration Art''' is a branch of [[Intervention art|Intervention Art]] in which artists collaborate with institutions, communities, politicians, religions, museums and pop-culture figures outside of the traditional art world. Unlike other forms of intervention art, Infiltration Art seeks to create symbiotic relationships with the host institutions.

Artists whose work incorporates elements of infiltration include [[Banksy]], Christian Cummings, [[Nikki S. Lee]], [[Taryn Simon]], [[Jeffrey Vallance]], [[David Hildebrand Wilson]], [[Fred Wilson (artist)|Fred Wilson]], the Nationwide Museum Mascot Project (NWMMP).

'''Jabal al-Druze''' ({{lang-ar|جبل الدروز}}, ''jabal ad-durūz'', ''Mountain of the Druze''), officially '''Jabal al-Arab''' ({{lang-ar|جبل العرب|links=no}}, ''jabal al-ʿarab'', ''Mountain of the Arabs''), is an elevated volcanic region in the [[As-Suwayda Governorate]] of southern [[Syria]]. Most of the inhabitants of this region are [[Druze]], and there are also small [[Islam|Muslim]] and [[Christian]] communities. [[Safaitic dialect|Safaitic]] inscriptions were first found in this area. The [[Jabal Druze State|State of Jabal Druze]] was an autonomous area in the [[French Mandate for Syria and the Lebanon]] from 1921 to 1936. In the past, the name Jabal al-Druze was used for a different area, located in [[Mount Lebanon]].{{cn|date=June 2015}}

==Geology==
[[File:Syria 2004 CIA map Jabal al-Druze.jpg|thumb|260px|Map of Jabal al-Druze]]
The Jabal al-Druze volcanic field, the southernmost in Syria, lies in the Haurun-Druze Plateau in SW Syria near the border with Jordan. The most prominent feature of this volcanic field is 1800m-high Jabal al-Druze (also known variously as Jabal ad Duruz, Djebel Al-Arab, Jabal Druze, Djebel ed Drouz). The alkaline volcanic field consists of a group of 118 basaltic volcanoes active from the [[Early Pleistocene|lower-Pleistocene]] to the [[Holocene]] (2.6 million years ago to present). The large SW Plateau depression is filled by basaltic lava flows from volcanoes aligned in a NW-SE direction. This volcanic field lies within the northern part of the massive alkaline [[Harrat al-Shamah]] (also known as Harrat al-Shaam) volcanic field that extends from southern Syria to Saudi Arabia.

* Tell Azran       (1220 m)
* Tell Shihan      (1138 m)

In [[Arabic language|Arabic]], the word "''[[Tell (archaeology)|tell]]''" means "mound" or "hill", but in Jabal al-Druze it rather refers to a [[volcanic cone]].

'''''Kubo and the Two Strings''''' is a 2016 American [[Stop motion|stop-motion]] [[action film|action]] [[fantasy film]] directed and produced by [[Travis Knight]] (in his directorial debut). It stars the voices of [[Charlize Theron]], [[Art Parkinson]], [[Ralph Fiennes]], [[Rooney Mara]], [[George Takei]], and [[Matthew McConaughey]]. It is the fourth feature film produced by [[Laika (company)|Laika]]. The film revolves around Kubo, a young boy who wields a magical [[shamisen]] (a Japanese [[guitar]]) and whose left eye was stolen during infancy. Accompanied by an anthropomorphic [[snow monkey]] and [[beetle]], he must subdue his mother's corrupted Sisters and his power-hungry grandfather Raiden (The Moon King), who is responsible for stealing his left eye.

''Kubo'' premiered at [[Melbourne International Film Festival]] and was released by [[Focus Features]] in the United States on August 19 to critical acclaim and grossed $77 million worldwide against a budget of $60 million. The film won the [[BAFTA Award for Best Animated Film]] and was nominated for the [[Academy Award]]s for [[Academy Award for Best Animated Feature|Best Animated Feature Film]] and [[Academy Award for Best Visual Effects|Best Visual Effects]], becoming the second animated film ever to be nominated in the latter category following 1993's ''[[The Nightmare Before Christmas]]'', and the first film to be nominated for both.

==Plot==
In [[feudal Japan]], 12-year-old eyepatched Kubo tends to his ill mother Sariatu (who bears a scar over her left eye as the result of a sailing accident at the beginning of the film) in a mountain cave near a small village. He earns their living by magically manipulating [[origami]] with music from his [[shamisen]] for the townsfolk, telling the tale of his missing father Hanzo, a [[samurai]] warrior. Kubo is never able to finish his story, as he does not know what happened to Hanzo and his mother herself cannot recall the ending due to her mental state deteriorating. Sariatu warns him not to stay out after dark as her Sisters, Karasu and Washi, and his estranged grandfather, the Moon King (who took his eye when he was a baby) will find him and take his remaining eye.

One day, Kubo learns of the village's [[Bon Festival|Bon festival]] allowing them to speak to deceased loved ones. Kubo attends but is angry that Hanzo does not appear from his lantern, and forgets to return home before sunset. Karasu and Washi quickly find him and attack, but Sariatu suddenly appears and uses her magic to send Kubo far away, telling him to find his father's armor while she fights off her Sisters before the screen goes white.

Kubo wakes up in a distant land during a [[blizzard]] to find Monkey, his wooden [[Japanese macaque|snow monkey]] charm, who has come to life. While taking shelter inside the mangled corpse of a whale, Monkey tells him Sariatu is gone and the village destroyed. With help of "Little Hanzo", an origami figure based on Kubo's father, they set out to find the armor. Along the way, they meet Beetle, an [[amnesia]]c samurai who was cursed to take the form of a [[stag beetle]]/human hybrid but believes himself to have been Hanzo's apprentice in the past.

Kubo, Monkey, and Beetle find the "Sword Unbreakable" in the Hall of Bones, a cave guarded by a [[Gashadokuro|giant skeleton]], but they defeat it and escape with the sword. They cross the Long Lake in a leaf boat to locate the "Breastplate Impenetrable" deep underwater. Kubo and Beetle swim down to retrieve it and encounter a sea monster, the "Garden of Eyes", who can entrance its victims with its many eyes by showing secrets and eating them. Kubo is caught in the creature's sight, but while entranced, comes to realize that Monkey is the reincarnated spirit of his mother. Beetle rescues the unconscious Kubo and obtains the Breastplate, but on returning to the boat, they find that Monkey has been badly wounded fighting and killing Karasu (as shown when her broken mask is floating in the ocean).

They go to shore to recover, where Monkey explains that she and her sisters were ordered by the Moon King to kill Hanzo, but she instead fell in love with him, and the Moon King branded her an enemy. That night, Kubo dreams of meeting Raiden, a blind elderly man, who points him towards the "Helmet Invulnerable" in Hanzo's abandoned fortress. They travel there the next day but realize too late it is a trap set by the Moon King and Washi. Washi reveals that Beetle is Hanzo, whom she and Karasu cursed for taking Sariatu away from them. Beetle is killed, and Monkey sacrifices herself, buying Kubo the time to use his shamisen to defeat Washi, breaking two of the three strings on it. Little Hanzo provides insight that the Helmet is actually the bell at the village, and Kubo breaks the last string to quickly travel there.

At the village, Kubo meets Raiden, who is revealed as the Moon King. He offers to take Kubo's other eye to make him immortal, but Kubo refuses. Raiden transforms into a giant ''[[Dunkleosteus]]''-like dragon, the Moon Beast, and pursues Kubo and the remaining villagers into its cemetery. When Hanzo's armor proves ineffective, Kubo removes it and restrings his shamisen using his mother's hair, his father's bowstring, and his own lock of hair. With the instrument, he summons the spirits of the villagers' loved ones, who show the Moon Beast that memories are the strongest magic of all and can never be destroyed. Kubo and the spirits' magic protect themselves and the villagers from the Moon Beast, stripping him of his powers and leaving him a mortal human being without any memories. Spurred on by Kubo's stories, the villagers take compassion and tell Raiden he was a man of many positive traits, accepting him into the village. Kubo is able to speak to his parents' spirits during the subsequent Bon ceremony, as they watch the deceased villagers' lanterns transform into golden [[heron]]s and fly to the spirit world into the sky.

==Production==
[[File:Takiyasha the Witch and the Skeleton Spectre.jpg|thumb|''[[Takiyasha the Witch and the Skeleton Spectre]]'' by [[Utagawa Kuniyoshi]] inspired the giant skeleton.]]
Announced in December 2014, the project is the directoral debut of Laika's CEO [[Travis Knight]].&lt;ref name=Deadline1&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hammond|first1=Pete|title=Laika &amp; Focus Begin Production On All-Star 'Kubo And The Two Strings' To Kick Off 3-Pic Deal|url=http://deadline.com/2014/12/laika-focus-three-picture-pact-kubo-and-the-two-strings-1201333450/|accessdate=January 15, 2015|publisher=[[Penske Business Media]]|work=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|date=December 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Knight was pitched the story by production designer [[Shannon Tindle]] as a "stop-motion samurai epic". Although the studio had never ventured into the genre before, Knight was enthusiastic about the project; owing partly his affinity towards both the "epic fantasy" genre as well as Japanese culture in general.&lt;ref name="Wired"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lott-Lavinga|first1=Ruby|title=Kubo and the Two Strings: an epic film made on a 12-foot-long table|url=https://www.wired.co.uk/article/kubo-and-the-two-strings-film-interview-travis-knight|website=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]|publisher=[[Condé Nast]]|accessdate=April 14, 2017|date=September 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The art took inspiration from such Japanese mediums as [[ink wash painting]] and [[origami]] among others. A particular influence came from the [[ukiyo-e]] wood block style, with Laika intending to make the entire film "to look and feel as if it's a moving woodblock print"&lt;ref name="Wired"/&gt; Assistance came from [[3D printing]] firm [[Stratasys]] who allowed Laika to use their newest technologies in exchange for feedback on them.&lt;ref name="Wired"/&gt;

For the Skeleton monster the team created a giant 16-foot (4.9m), 400-pound (180&amp;nbsp;kg) puppet, which Laika claims is the record holder for largest stop-motion puppet.&lt;ref name="cartoonbrewrobot"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Fails|first1=Ian|title=Laika Was Crazy Enough To Animate A 16-Foot Tall Skeleton for 'Kubo and The Two Strings'|url=http://www.cartoonbrew.com/feature-film/laika-crazy-enough-animate-16-foot-tall-skeleton-kubo-two-strings-142544.html|date=August 19, 2016|website=Cartoon Brew|accessdate=April 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea to make such a massive puppet was born out of a fear that individual smaller parts (meant to represent the larger monster) would not work well on screen interacting with the other puppets.&lt;ref name="cartoonbrewrobot"/&gt; The resulting puppet was built in two parts which were then attached together by [[magnets]]. For movement Laika had to design a robot to easily manipulate it. The team at one point purchased an [[industrial robot]] off of [[eBay]] but found that it would not work with their setup.&lt;ref name="cartoonbrewrobot"/&gt;

[[Christy Lemire]] of [[Roger Ebert|RogerEbert.com]] awarded the film 3.5 stars out of 4, saying that "one of the most impressive elements of ''Kubo and the Two Strings''—besides its dazzling stop-motion animation, its powerful performances and its transporting score—is the amount of credit it gives its audience, particularly its younger viewers."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/kubo-and-the-two-strings-2016|date=August 19, 2016|title=Kubo and the Two Strings|work=RogerEbert.com|publisher=Ebert Digital LLC|first=Christy|last=Lemire|accessdate=August 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[IGN]]'s Samantha Ladwig gave the film 7.5/10, stating that the film is "Dark, twisted, and occasionally scary, but also with humor, love, and inspiration."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uk.ign.com/articles/2016/08/12/kubo-and-the-two-strings-review|title=Kubo and the Two Strings Review |work=[[IGN]]|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]|date=August 12, 2016|first=Samantha|last=Ladwig|accessdate=August 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jesse Hassenger, of ''[[The A.V. Club]]'', praised the film, saying that "no American animation studio is better-suited to dreamlike plotting than Laika, and the animation of Kubo is truly dazzling, mixing sophistication and handmade charm with inspired flow."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.avclub.com/review/laika-releases-another-less-ghoulish-triumph-kubo--241203|title=Laika releases another, less ghoulish triumph with Kubo And The Two Strings|work=[[The A.V.

Michael O'Sullivan of ''[[The Washington Post]]'' gave the film 4/4 stars, stating that the film is "both extraordinarily original and extraordinarily complex, even for a grown-up movie masquerading as a kiddie cartoon (which it kind of is)."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/goingoutguide/movies/kubo-and-the-two-strings-weaves-a-magical-tale-that-feels-both-ancient-and-fresh/2016/08/18/a8f33754-60a3-11e6-9d2f-b1a3564181a1_story.html|date=August 18, 2016|first=Michael|last=O'Sullivan|publisher=The Washington Post Company|title='Kubo and the Two Strings' weaves a magical tale that feels both ancient and fresh |work=[[The Washington Post]]|accessdate=August 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[The New York Times]]'', [[Glenn Kenny]] said that "the movie's blend of stop-motion animation for the main action with computer-generated backgrounds is seamless, creating what is the most visually intoxicating of all Laika's movies."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/19/movies/kubo-and-the-two-strings-review.html|title=Kubo and the Two Strings |work=[[The New York Times]]|publisher=The New York Times Company|date=August 19, 2016|first=Glenn|last=Kenny|accessdate=August 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Peter Debruge of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' wrote that ""Kubo" offers another ominous mission for a lucky young misfit, this one a dark, yet thrilling adventure quest that stands as the crowning achievement in Laika's already impressive oeuvre."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2016/film/reviews/kubo-and-the-two-strings-review-1201834995/|date=August 12, 2016|title='Kubo and the Two Strings' Review: Puts the Emotion in Stop-Motion |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|publisher=[[Penske Business Media]]|first=Peter|last=Debruge|accessdate=August 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jonathan Pile of ''[[Empire (film magazine)|Empire]]'', wrote of the film: "Yet another success for stop-motion giants Laika&amp;nbsp;… boasts big laughs and effective scares in a typically gorgeous animated tale."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.empireonline.com/movies/kubo-two-strings/review/|date=August 12, 2016|title=Kubo And The Two Strings Review |work=[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]]|first=Jonathan|last=Pile|accessdate=August 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Controversy ===
While the film received critical acclaim for its craft and story, it was criticized for its perceived [[Whitewashing in film|whitewashing]] as a movie set in ancient Japan but featuring a centrally white cast. George Takei and Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa were the only actors of Asian descent playing the role of minor characters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.complex.com/pop-culture/2016/08/kubo-and-the-two-strings-whitewashing|title=The 'Kubo and the Two Strings' Controversy Proves Whitewashing Is More Complicated Than You Think|website=[[Complex (magazine)|Complex]]|publisher=Complex Media|first=Mikelle|last=Street|date=August 23, 2016|access-date=June 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://deadline.com/2016/08/kubo-and-two-strings-protest-white-actors-japanese-characters-manaa-1201807914/|title=Watchdog Group Chides Laika For "White-Washing" 'Kubo And The Two Strings'|last=Pedersen|first=Erik|date=August 24, 2016|work=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|access-date=June 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''liaison officer''' is a person who liaises between two organizations to communicate and coordinate their activities.  Generally, liaison officers are used to achieve the best utilization of resources or employment of services of one organization by another. Liaison officers often provide technical or subject matter expertise of their parent organization. Usually an organization embeds a liaison officer into another organization to provide [[face-to-face interaction|face-to-face]] coordination.

== Military Liaison Officers (LNOs) ==
In the military, liaison officers may coordinate activities to protect units from [[collateral damage]].  They also work to achieve mutual understanding or [[unity of effort]] among desperate groups.&lt;ref&gt;[[Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff|Chairman, U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff]].  Civil-Military Operations, Joint Publication (JP) 1-02 (Washington, DC: CJCS, amended through October 15, 2001), p. 250.&lt;/ref&gt;  For incidence or disaster management, liaison officers serve as [[Point of contact|the primary contact]] for agencies responding to the situation.

== Community Liaison Officers (CLOs) ==
In the foreign service, community liaison officers support employees and family members who are assigned to foreign embassies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = CLO Program|url = https://www.state.gov/m/dghr/flo/c1964.htm|website = www.state.gov|accessdate = 2015-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States foreign service, they are charged with building community spirit and enhancing morale at post. Currently,  CLOs operate at over 200 U.S. missions worldwide, including several unaccompanied posts such as Baghdad, Kabul, and Islamabad.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = CLO Program|url = https://www.state.gov/m/dghr/flo/c1964.htm|website = www.state.gov|accessdate = 2015-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Challenges===
Since one of the primary tasks of a liaison is often to coordinate activities between two or more organizations, people in these positions typically need to possess strong language and communication skills. This presents a challenge in the case of CLOs, who are posted to missions in their capacity as a spouse. Many have therefore not received the necessary training in order to be proficient in the local language prior to being posted overseas. According to some commentators, this makes it difficult for many CLOs to be effective at their jobs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Time to Rethink the CLO Position {{!}} USC Center on Public Diplomacy|url = http://islandssociety.org/research/centers/public-diplomacy/publications/time-to-rethink-the-community-liaison-officer-position/|website = islandssociety.org|accessdate = 2015-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his words, [[Eddie Walsh (journalist)|Eddie Walsh]] argues, "Unfortunately, it is hard to understand how CLO Coordinators can effectively liaise with the local community to provide 'programming, information, resources, and referrals' about off-post activities and on-the-economy services when they are not required to be fluent in the local language." Others disagree. For example, George Wilcox counters, "In the 1990s my wife served twice as CLO, once in Central Asia, where she didn't speak the language and once in Brazil, where she did. She did an excellent job in both places, mostly because of her empathy for family members and her proactive involvement in helping them to adjust successfully to life in the two countries."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Time to Rethink the CLO Position {{!}} USC Center on Public Diplomacy|url = http://uscpublicdiplomacy.org/blog/time-rethink-clo-position|website = uscpublicdiplomacy.org|accessdate = 2015-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Supporter Liaison Officers (SLOs) ==
{{main|Supporter liaison officer}}

A supporter liaison officer is a person within an association football club (or another sports club) functioning as a bridge between the club itself and supporters of the club. The SLO builds relations with the club management and the fans through two-way communication, informing supporters about decisions made by the club and informing the club about the fan's point of view. The SLO also works with security and police as well as the SLOs of other clubs to ensure that relevant knowledge is spread to all organisations participating in matches and other events of the club.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=UEFA Supporter Liaison Officer Handbook |publisher=[[UEFA]] |year=2011 |location=Nyon  |url=https://www.uefa.com/MultimediaFiles/Download/Tech/uefaorg/General/01/84/35/28/1843528_DOWNLOAD.pdf |accessdate=2017-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:HistMac.gif|326px|thumb|The contemporary geographical [[Macedonia (region)|region of Macedonia]] is not ''officially defined'' by any international organisation or state. In some contexts it appears to span five current sovereign countries: [[Albania]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Greece]], the [[Republic of Macedonia]], and [[Serbia]]. For more details see the ''boundaries and definitions'' section in [[Macedonia (region)#Boundaries and definitions|Macedonia (region)]]]]
The name '''''Macedonia''''' is used in a number of competing or overlapping meanings to describe geographical, political and historical areas, languages and peoples in a part of south-eastern Europe. It has been a major source of political controversy since the early 20th century. The situation is complicated because different ethnic groups use different terminology for the same entity, or the same terminology for different entities, with different political connotations.

Historically, the region has presented markedly shifting borders across the [[Balkans|Balkan]] peninsula. Geographically, no single definition of its borders or the names of its subdivisions is accepted by all scholars and ethnic groups. Demographically, it is mainly inhabited by four ethnic groups, three of which self-identify as ''Macedonians'': two, a [[Macedonians (Bulgarians)|Bulgarian]] and a [[Macedonians (Greeks)|Greek]] one at a regional level, while a third [[Macedonians (ethnic group)|ethnic Macedonian]] one at a national level. Linguistically, the names and affiliations of languages and dialects spoken in the region are a source of controversy. Politically, the rights to the extent of the use of the name ''Macedonia'' and its derivatives has led to a [[Macedonia naming dispute|diplomatic dispute]] between [[Greece]] and the [[Republic of Macedonia]]. Despite mediation of the [[United Nations]], the dispute is still pending resolution since 1993, but as a result it was admitted under the provisional reference of the "former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia", sometimes abbreviated as FYROM.

== Etymology ==
The name ''Macedonia'' derives from the [[Greek language|Greek]] {{lang|grc|Μακεδονία}} (''Makedonía''),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3D%2364599 Μακεδονία], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus&lt;/ref&gt; a [[Macedon|kingdom]] (later, [[Macedonia (region)|region]]) named after the [[ancient Macedonians]], from the Greek {{lang|grc|Μακεδόνες}} (''Makedones''), "Macedonians", explained as having originally meant either "the tall ones" or "highlanders".&lt;ref&gt;{{OEtymD|Macedonia}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word {{lang|el|Μακεδνόν}} (''Makednon'') is first attested in [[Herodotus]] as the name which the Greek [[Ethnic group|ethnos]] was called (which was later called [[Dorians|Dorian]]) when it settled around [[Pindus]] mountain range.&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus , ''Histories'', [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0125%3Abook%3D1%3Achapter%3D56%3Asection%3D3 1.56.2,3]: "ταῦτα γὰρ ἦν τὰ προκεκριμένα, ἐόντα τὸ ἀρχαῖον τὸ μὲν Πελασγικὸν τὸ δὲ Ἑλληνικὸν ἔθνος. καὶ τὸ μὲν οὐδαμῇ κω ἐξεχώρησε, τὸ δὲ πολυπλάνητον κάρτα. ἐπὶ μὲν γὰρ Δευκαλίωνος βασιλέος οἴκεε γῆν τὴν Φθιῶτιν, ἐπὶ δὲ Δώρου τοῦ Ἕλληνος τὴν ὑπὸ τὴν Ὄσσαν τε καὶ τὸν Ὄλυμπον χώρην, καλεομένην δὲ Ἱστιαιῶτιν: ἐκ δὲ τῆς Ἱστιαιώτιδος ὡς ἐξανέστη ὑπὸ Καδμείων, οἴκεε ἐν Πίνδῳ Μακεδνὸν καλεόμενον: ἐνθεῦτεν δὲ αὖτις ἐς τὴν Δρυοπίδα μετέβη καὶ ἐκ τῆς Δρυοπίδος οὕτω ἐς Πελοπόννησον ἐλθὸν Δωρικὸν ἐκλήθη."&lt;/ref&gt; ''Makednon'' is related to the [[Ancient Greek]] adjective {{lang|grc|μακεδνός}} (''makednós''), meaning "tall, slim",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dmakedno%2Fs μακεδνός], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus&lt;/ref&gt; attested in [[Homer]] and [[Hesychius of Alexandria]] in its feminine form "μακεδνή" (''makednē''), meaning "long, tall".&lt;ref&gt;Homer, ''Odyssey'', [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:abo:tlg,0012,002:7:106&amp;lang=original 7.106]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/hesychiialexand00schmgoog#page/n537/mode/2up Hesychii Alexandrini lexicon]&lt;/ref&gt;  It cognates with the words {{lang|grc|μακρός}} (''makros'', "long, large")&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dmakro%2Fs1 μακρός], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus&lt;/ref&gt; and {{lang|grc|μήκος}} (''mēkos'', "length"),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dmh%3Dkos μήκος], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus&lt;/ref&gt; both deriving from the [[Indo-European root]] ''*mak-'', meaning "long' or "slender".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.etymonline.com/word/*mak- *mak-], Etymonline&lt;/ref&gt; Linguist [[Robert S.

{{Historical Macedonia}}
The [[Macedonia (region)|region of Macedonia]] has been home to several historical political entities, which have used the name ''Macedonia''; the main ones are given below. The borders of each of these entities were different.

=== Early history ===

==== Ancient Macedonia ====
{{Main article|Macedonia (ancient kingdom)}}
[[Macedonia (ancient kingdom)|Macedonia]] or ''Macedon'', the ancient [[monarchy|kingdom]],&lt;ref name="Definition of Macedon"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mark|first1=Joshua J.|title=Macedon definition|url=https://www.ancient.eu/macedon/|website=Ancient history|publisher=Ancient History encyclopedia}}&lt;/ref&gt;  was located on the periphery of [[Archaic Greece|Archaic]] and [[Classical Greece]], and later became the dominant state of [[Hellenistic Greece]]. It was centered on the fertile plains west of the [[Gulf of Salonica]] (today north-western [[Greece]]); the first Macedonian state emerged in the 8th or early 7th century&amp;nbsp;BC. Its extent beyond the center varied; some Macedonian kings could not hold their capital; [[Philip II of Macedon|Philip II]] expanded his power until it reached from [[Epirus]], across [[Thrace]] to Gallipoli, and from [[Thermopylae]] to the Danube.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Lane Fox | first=Robin | authorlink = Robin Lane Fox|title=Alexander the Great |publisher=Allen Lane |location=London |year=1973 |isbn=978-0-7139-0500-7 |pages=17, 30}}&lt;/ref&gt; His son [[Alexander the Great]] conquered most of the land in southwestern Asia stretching from what is currently Turkey in the west to parts of India in the east. However, while Alexander's conquests are of major historical importance as having launched the [[Hellenistic Age]], Macedon as a state had no significant territorial gains due to them. Alexander's kingdom fell apart after his death in 323 BC; several of his [[Diadochi|Successors]] attempted to form a kingdom for themselves in Macedonia; the kingdom formed by [[Antigonus Gonatas]] contained all the land Philip II had started with and controlled much of what is now modern Greece; it lasted until the Romans divided it into four republics in 168&amp;nbsp;BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rostovtseff|first=Michael Ivanovitch|title=History of the Ancient World (translated by James Duff Duff)|volume=II|page=78|year=1926|publisher=Biblo &amp; Tannen Publishers|isbn=978-0-8196-2163-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Roman Macedonia ====
{{Main article|Macedonia (Roman province)}}
{{See also|Diocese of Macedonia}}
The ancient Romans had two different entities called ''Macedonia'', at different levels. [[Macedonia (Roman province)|Macedonia]] was established as a [[Roman province]] in 146&amp;nbsp;BC. Its boundaries were shifted from time to time for administrative convenience, but during the [[Roman Republic]] and the [[Principate]] it extended west to the Adriatic and south to [[Central Greece]].

Under [[Diocletian]], [[Thessaly]], including parts of [[West Macedonia]], was split off to form a new province, and the central and southern Balkan provinces were grouped into the [[Diocese of Moesia]]. At some point in the 4th century (first securely attested in 370) this was divided into two new dioceses, the mostly Latin-speaking [[Diocese of Dacia]] in the north and the mostly Greek-speaking [[Diocese of Macedonia]] in the south. Under [[Constantine the Great]], the western part of the province of Macedonia was also split off to form the new province of [[Epirus nova]].  After Constantine's death, the western Balkans, Macedonia included, became part of the [[praetorian prefecture of Illyricum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Roisman|Worthington|2010|pp=547–548}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the exception of a short-lived division between ''Macedonia Prima'' in the south and ''Macedonia Salutaris'' in the north towards the end of the 4th century (attested only in the ''[[Notitia Dignitatum]]''), Macedonia formed a single province until re-divided into southern and northern parts sometime in the late 5th century (the division is first securely attested in 482), although the province seems to have been reunified by 535. According to the 6th-century ''[[Synecdemus]]'', ''Macedonia Prima'', with [[Thessalonica]] as its capital and governed by a ''[[consularis]]'', counted 32 cities, and  ''Macedonia Secunda'' in the north, with [[Stobi]] as its capital and governed by a ''[[praeses]]'', only eight. The approximate boundary between the two ran on a rough line from north of [[Bitola]] (which belonged to ''Macedonia Prima'') to the area of [[Demir Kapija]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Roisman|Worthington|2010|pp=548–550}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Kazhdan|1991|p=1261}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Byzantine Macedonia ====
{{Main article|Macedonia (theme)}}
During the 7th century, most of the Balkans were overrun by [[Slavs|Slavic]] invasions, which left only the fortified towns and the coasts in the hands of the Greek-speaking [[Byzantine Empire]]. "[[Macedonia (theme)|Macedonia]]" was then used for a new [[theme (Byzantine administrative unit)|theme]] in the late 8th century under [[Irene of Athens]]. Geographically however it was located in [[Thrace]] and not in Macedonia, which was under the themes of [[Thessalonica (theme)|Thessalonica]], [[Strymon (theme)|Strymon]] and other smaller commands such as [[Boleron]] or [[Drougoubiteia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Kazhdan|1991|pp=1261–1262, 1968}}&lt;/ref&gt; Themes were not named geographically and the original sense was "army". They became districts during the military and fiscal crisis of the seventh century, when the Byzantine armies were instructed to find their supplies from the locals, wherever they happened to be. Thus the [[Armeniac theme]] was considerably west of [[Armenia]]; the [[Thracesian Theme]] was in Asia Minor, not in Thrace.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Treadgold|1997|pp=421, 478, ''et passim''}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Macedonian dynasty]] of the Byzantine Empire acquired its name from its founder, [[Basil I the Macedonian]], an [[Armenians|Armenian]] by descent, who was born in the theme of Macedonia.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Treadgold|1997|p=455}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The interior of Macedonia remained in Slavic and later [[First Bulgarian Empire|Bulgarian]] hands until the [[Byzantine conquest of Bulgaria|campaigns]] of [[Basil II]], which ended the existence of the Bulgarian state and extended Byzantine authority across the central and northern Balkans. Thereafter Macedonia remained under Byzantine control until the [[Fourth Crusade]] (1204). A short-lived  [[Latins (Middle Ages)|Latin]] [[Kingdom of Thessalonica]] was established which survived until 1224, when it was captured by [[Despotate of Epirus|Epirus]]. Most of Macedonia then came under the control of the [[Empire of Nicaea]] in 1246, although its northern regions remained disputed with the [[Medieval Serbia|Serbs]] and the [[Second Bulgarian Empire|Bulgarians]]. Most of the region was conquered by the Serbs under [[Stephen Dushan]] during the [[Byzantine civil war of 1341–1347]]. Only Thessalonica and its environs remained in Byzantine hands. By the late 14th century, the [[Ottoman Turks]] in turn had conquered the region, although Thessalonica held out under Byzantine and later [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] control [[Siege of Thessalonica (1422–1430)|until 1430]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Kazhdan|1991|pp=1262, 2072–2073}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Ottomans and geographical Macedonia ====
{{Main article|Ottoman Macedonia (disambiguation){{!}}Ottoman Macedonia}}
{{See also|Macedonian Struggle|Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization}}

The Ottomans did not keep Macedonia as an [[Subdivisions of the Ottoman Empire|administrative unit]]&lt;ref&gt;The region was not called "Macedonia" by the Ottomans, and the name "Macedonia" gained currency together with the ascendance of rival nationalism. Collective Memory, National Identity, and Ethnic Conflict: Greece, Bulgaria, and the Macedonian Question, Victor Roudometof, Greenwood Publishing Group, 2002, {{ISBN|0275976483}}, p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt;: since 1864 parts of [[geographical Macedonia]] lay in three [[Wilayah|vilayets]], which also comprised some non-Macedonian areas. The northern part was the Kosovo vilayet and then of [[Skopje]]; the [[Thessaloniki]] (south), and the [[Monastir Province, Ottoman Empire|Monastir Vilayet]] (western) were also created. This administrative division lasted until 1912–13, when Macedonia was divided among the Balkan states.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Rossos|2008|p=67}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Miller |first= William |title= The Ottoman empire and its successors |location = Cambridge [Eng.] |publisher = The University Press |year = 1936 |pages=9, 447–49}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Modern history ===
{{main article|History of modern Macedonia}}
{{See also|Peoples Liberation War of Macedonia|National Liberation Front (Macedonia)}}

Since the early stages of the [[Greek Revolution]], the provisional government of Greece claimed Macedonia as part of Greek national territory, but the [[Treaty of Constantinople (1832)]], which established a Greek independent state, set its northern boundary between [[Arta, Greece|Arta]] and [[Volos]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| first=John | last= Comstock| title= History of the Greek Revolution| location= New York |year= 1829|page=5|publisher=W. W. Reed &amp; co}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the [[Ottoman Empire]] started breaking apart, ''Macedonia'' was claimed by all members of the [[Balkan League]] ([[Serbia]], [[Montenegro]], Greece and Bulgaria), and by [[Romania]]. Under the [[Treaty of San Stefano]] that ended the [[Russo-Turkish War, 1877–78]] the entire region, except Thessaloniki, was included in the borders of [[Bulgaria]], but after the [[Congress of Berlin]] in 1878 the region was returned to the Ottoman Empire. The armies of the Balkan League advanced and occupied ''Macedonia'' in the [[First Balkan War]] in 1912. Because of disagreements between the allies about the partition of the region, the [[Second Balkan War]] erupted, and in its aftermath the arbitrary region of Macedonia was split into the following entities, that existed or still exist in this region:
* [[Macedonia (Greece)|Macedonia]] (as a region of Greece) refers to three [[modern regions of Greece|regions]] in [[northern Greece]], incorporated in 1913, as a result of the [[Balkan Wars]] between the Ottoman Empire and the [[Balkan League]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Poulton|2000|pp=85–86}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Macedonia (as a [[People's Republic]] within [[Yugoslavia]]) used to refer to the [[People's Republic of Macedonia]] established in 1946, later known as the Socialist Republic of Macedonia, one of the constituent republics of the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]], renamed in 1963.&lt;ref name=LOC&gt;{{loc}} {{cite web| url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/yutoc.html | title= The Library of Congress, Country Studies | website=Yugoslavia | accessdate = 17 July 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1929 and 1941 this region was part of [[Vardar Banovina]] province in the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]].
* [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]] (as a contemporary [[sovereign state]]) refers{{#tag:ref|The constitutional name of the country "''Republic of Macedonia''" and the short name "''Macedonia''" when referring to the country, can be considered offensive by most [[Greeks]], especially inhabitants of the Greek province of Macedonia. The official reasons for this, as described by the [[Foreign relations of Greece|Greek Ministry of Foreign Affairs]], are:

{{quotation|
"The choice of the name Macedonia by FYROM directly raises the issue of usurpation of the cultural heritage of a neighbouring country. The name constitutes the basis for staking an exclusive rights claim over the entire geographical area of Macedonia. More specifically, to call only the Slavo-Macedonians Macedonians monopolizes the name for the Slavo-Macedonians and creates semiological confusion, whilst violating the human rights and the right to self-determination of Greek Macedonians. The use of the name by FYROM alone may also create problems in the trade area, and subsequently become a potential springboard for distorting reality, and a basis for activities far removed from the standards set by the European Union and more specifically the clause on good neighbourly relations. The best example of this is to be seen in the content of school textbooks in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia."&lt;ref name=GrFA&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www2.mfa.gr/www.mfa.gr/en-US/Policy/Geographic+Regions/South-Eastern+Europe/Balkans/Bilateral+Relations/FYROM/FYROM+-+THE+NAME+ISSUE.htm |title=Hellenic Republic, Ministry of Foreign Affairs |accessdate=July 17, 2006 |website=Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYROM)&amp;nbsp;— The Name Issue |publisher= |pages= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060708044400/http://www2.mfa.gr/www.mfa.gr/en-US/Policy/Geographic+Regions/South-Eastern+Europe/Balkans/Bilateral+Relations/FYROM/FYROM+-+THE+NAME+ISSUE.htm |archivedate=8 July 2006 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Geography ==
Macedonia (as a current geographical term) refers to a region of the Balkan peninsula in [[south-eastern Europe]], covering some 60,000 or 70,000 square kilometers. Although the region's borders are not officially defined by any international organization or state, in some contexts, the territory appears to correspond to the basins of (from west to east) the [[Haliacmon]] (Aliákmonas), [[Vardar|Vardar / Axios]] and [[Struma River|Struma / Strymónas]] rivers, and the plains around Thessaloniki and Serres.{{#tag:ref|For an attempt to delineate the boundaries of the region, see Kontogiorgi (2006).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Kontogiorgi |first=Elisabeth |title=Population Exchange in Greek Macedonia |year=2006 |isbn=978-0-19-927896-1 |pages=11–13 |publisher=Oxford University Press |chapter=Macedonia 1870–1922&amp;nbsp;– The Regional Context}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=Note}}

In a [[Historical regions of the Balkan Peninsula|historic context]], the term ''Macedonia'' was used in various ways. Macedonia was not an administrative division of the Ottoman Empire; its entire territory was part of the ''beylerbeylik'' of [[Rumelia]].&lt;ref name="mccarthy1"&gt;{{cite book|first=Justin|last=McCarthy|authorlink=Justin McCarthy (American historian)|year= 2001|title=The Ottoman Peoples and the End of Empire|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-340-70657-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Rossos|2008|p=51}}&lt;/ref&gt; The geographer H.&amp;nbsp;R.

Many [[ethnographic]] maps were produced in this period of controversy; these differ primarily in the areas given to each nationality within Macedonia. This was in part a result of the choice of definition: an inhabitant of Macedonia might well have different nationalities depending on whether the basis of classification was [[religious denomination|denomination]], [[kinship and descent|descent]], [[language]], [[self-identification]] or personal choice. In addition, the Ottoman census, taken on the basis of [[religion]], was misquoted by all sides; descent, or "[[Race (classification of human beings)|race]]", was largely conjectural; inhabitants of Macedonia might speak a different language at the market and at home, and the same Slavic dialect might be called Serbian "with Bulgarian influences", Macedonian, or West-Bulgarian.{{#tag:ref|For the difficulties to determine the national divisions of the population through the Ottoman census, see Jelavich (1993).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Jelavich|first=Barbara|title=History of the Balkans|year=1993|isbn=978-0-521-27459-3|chapter=The end of Ottoman Rule in Europe|page=91|publisher=Cambridge University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the Ottoman census and surveys about the population of Macedonia between 1882–1906, see Shaw (1977).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Shaw|first=Ezel Kural|title=History of the Ottoman Empire and Modern Turkey|year=1977|isbn=978-0-521-29166-8|chapter=The Rise of Modern Turkey|pages=208–209|publisher=Cambridge University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=Note}}

These maps also differed somewhat in the boundaries given to Macedonia. Its only inarguable limits were the [[Aegean Sea]] and the Serbian and Bulgarian frontiers (as of 1885); where it bordered Old Serbia, Albania, and Thrace (all parts of Ottoman [[Rumelia]]) was debatable.&lt;ref name="wilkinson"/&gt;

The Greek ethnographer Nicolaides, the Austrian Meinhard, and the Bulgarian Kǎnčev placed the northern boundary of Macedonia at the [[Šar Mountain]]s and the [[Skopska Crna Gora|Crna hills]], as had scholars before 1878. The Serb Gopčevič preferred a line much further south, assigning the entire region from Skopje to [[Strumica]] to "Old Serbia"; and some later Greek geographers have defined a more restricted Macedonia. In addition, maps might vary in smaller details: as to whether this town or that was Macedonian. One Italian map included [[Prizren]], where Nicolaides and Meinhard had drawn the boundary just south of it. On the south and west, [[Grevena]], [[Korçë]], and [[Konitsa]] varied from map to map; on the east, the usual line is the lower [[Mesta River|Mesta / Nestos]] river and then north or northwest, but one German geographer takes the line so far west as to exclude [[Bansko]] and [[Gotse Delchev (town)|Nevrokop / Gotse Delchev]].&lt;ref name="wilkinson"/&gt;

The region of Macedonia is commonly divided into three major and two minor sub-regions.&lt;ref name="Danforth_44"&gt;{{harvp|Danforth|1995|p=44}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name ''Macedonia'' appears under certain contexts on the major regions, while the smaller ones are traditionally referred to by other local [[toponyms]]:

==== Major regions ====
The region of Macedonia is commonly split geographically into three main sub-regions, especially when discussing the Macedonian Question. The terms are used in non-partisan scholarly works, although they are also used in [[Macedonians (ethnic group)|ethnic Macedonian]] literature of an [[irredentist]] nature.&lt;ref name= mymk&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mymacedonia.net/aegean/aegean.htm | title=Aegean Part of Macedonia|publisher=MyMacedonia.net | accessdate = 22 July 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Aegean Macedonia]]''{{#tag:ref|During the [[Greek Civil War]], in 1947, the [[Minister for the Press and the Media (Greece)|Greek Ministry of Press and Information]] published a book, ''I Enandion tis Ellados Epivoulis'' ("Designs on Greece"), namely of documents and speeches on the ongoing Macedonian issue, many translations from Yugoslav officials. It reports [[Josip Broz Tito]] using the term "Aegean Macedonia" on 11 October 1945 in the buildup to the Greek Civil War; the original document is archived in 'GFM A/24581/G2/1945'. For Athens, the "new term, Aegean Macedonia", (also ''"Pirin Macedonia"''), was introduced by Yugoslavs. Contextually, this observation indicates this was part of the Yugoslav offensive against Greece, laying claim to Greek Macedonia, but Athens does not take issue with the term itself. The 1945 date concurs with Bulgarian sources.

==== Minor regions ====
In addition to the above named sub-regions, there are also two smaller regions, in [[Albania]] and Serbia respectively. These regions are also considered geographically part of Macedonia. They are referred to by ethnic Macedonians as follows,&lt;ref name= mymk /&gt; but typically are not so referred to by non-partisan scholars.&lt;ref&gt;E.g., see {{harvp|Poulton|2000|p=146}}; {{harvp|Rossos|2008|p=2}}: "Albania received the relatively small areas of Mala Prespa and Golo Brdo."&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mala Prespa|Mala Prespa and Golo Brdo]] is a small area in the west of the Macedonia region in Albania, mainly around [[Lake Ohrid]]. It includes parts of the [[Korçë District|Korçë]], [[Pogradec District|Pogradec]] and [[Devoll District|Devoll]] districts. These districts in whole occupy about {{convert|3000|km2|sqmi|0}}, but the area concerned is significantly smaller.&lt;ref&gt;See {{harvp|Rossos|2008|p=132}}, for the small parts of the region of Macedonia, which were given to Albania in 1912.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gora (region)|Gora]] (part of the municipality of [[Dragaš (town)|Dragaš]]) and [[Prohor Pčinjski]] are minor parts in the north of the Macedonia region in Serbia.{{#tag:ref|For the conflicts between Serbs and ethnic Macedonians about the Gora region and Proho, see Bugajski (1995)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bugajski|first=Janusz|title=Ethnic Politics in Eastern Europe|pages=122–123|chapter=Macedonia|quote=Conflicts between Serbs and Macedonians have also persisted over the status of the Prohor Pčinjski Monastery, which was technically on the Serbian side of the border but claimed as a major Macedonian shrine |year=1995|publisher=M.&amp;nbsp;E.

== Demographics ==
{{main article|Demographic history of Macedonia}}

The region, as defined above, has a total population of about 5 million. The main disambiguation issue in demographics is the self-identifying name of two contemporary groups. The ethnic Macedonian population of the Republic of Macedonia self-identify as ''Macedonian'' on a national level, while the Greek Macedonians self-identify as both ''Macedonian'' on a regional, and ''Greek'' on a national level. According to the Greek arguments, the ancient Macedonians' nationality was Greek and thus, the use of the term on a national level lays claims to their history. This disambiguation problem has led to a wide variety of terms used to refer to the separate groups, more information of which can be found in the [[#Terminology by group|terminology by group]] section.

As a regional group in Greece, Macedonians refers to ethnic Greeks (98%, 2001) living in regions referred to as Macedonia, and particularly Greek Macedonia. This group composes the vast majority of the population of the Greek region of Macedonia. The 2001 census for the total population of the Macedonia region in Greece shows 2,625,681.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.statistics.gr/gr_tables/S1101_SAP_01_TB_DC_01_02_Y.zip| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070929131544/http://www.statistics.gr/gr_tables/S1101_SAP_01_TB_DC_01_02_Y.zip| archivedate= 29 September 2007 | publisher= General Secretariat of National Statistical Service of Greece | title= 2001 census | language=Greek | format = zip xls | accessdate = 21 July 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The same term in antiquity described the inhabitants of the kingdom of Macedon, including their notable rulers Philip II and Alexander the Great who self-identified as Greeks.&lt;ref name=savill&gt;{{cite book|last=Savill|first=Agnes|year=1990|title=Alexander the Great and his Time|publisher=Barnes &amp; Noble Publishing|chapter=Accession of Alexander|pages=9–10|isbn=978-0-88029-591-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a regional group in Bulgaria, Macedonians refers to the inhabitants of [[Bulgarian Macedonia]], who in their vast majority self-identify as Bulgarians at a national level and as ''Macedonians'' at a regional, but not ethnic level.&lt;ref name=bcb /&gt; As of 2001, the total population of Bulgarian Macedonia is 341,245, while the ethnic Macedonians living in the same region are 3,117.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.nsi.bg/Census/Ethnos.htm | publisher=National Statistical Institute (of Bulgaria) | language=Bulgarian| title= 2001 census | accessdate = 3 August 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Bulgarian Macedonians'' also self-identify as ''[[Pirin]]ers'' (пиринци, ''pirintsi'')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.digsys.com/bgnews/show_story.html?issue=90964855&amp;media=3945184&amp;class=8474908&amp;story=90964856 | publisher=Български новини | title=Поне един ден веселие и безгрижие | accessdate = 12 September 2006 | language=Bulgarian}}&lt;/ref&gt; to avoid confusion with the neighboring ethnic group.

Macedo-Romanians can be used as an alternative name for [[Aromanians]], people living throughout the southern Balkans, especially in northern Greece, Albania, the Republic of Macedonia and Bulgaria, and as an emigrant community in [[Northern Dobruja]], Romania. According to [[Ethnologue]], their total population in all countries is 306,237.&lt;ref name= Macedo-Romanians&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=rup | publisher= Ethnologue | title= Report for Macedo-Romanian language | accessdate = 3 August 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This not very frequent appellation is the only one with the disambiguating [[portmanteau]], both within the members of the same ethnic group and the other ethnic groups in the area.&lt;ref name= oxford4&gt;Oxford English Dictionary Unabridged&amp;nbsp;— Draft Revision (Mar. 2005)&amp;nbsp;— "Macedo-"&lt;/ref&gt; To make matters more confusing, Aromanians are often called "Machedoni" by Romanians, as opposed to the citizens of Macedonia, who are called "Macedoneni".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Shea|1997|p=162}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ethnic Albanians living in the region of Macedonia, as defined above, are mainly concentrated in the Republic of Macedonia (especially in the northwestern part that borders [[Kosovo]] and Albania), and less in the Albanian [[#Minor regions|minor sub-region]] of Macedonia around the Lake Ohrid. As of 2002, the total population of [[Albanians in the Republic of Macedonia|Albanians within the republic]] is 509,083 or 25.2% of the country's total population.&lt;ref name= census-mk /&gt;

As language is one of the elements tied in with national identity, the same disputes that are voiced over demographics are also found in linguistics. There are two main disputes about the use of the word Macedonian to describe a linguistic phenomenon, be it a language or a dialect:

Modern [[Macedonian language]],&lt;ref name=offensive3 group=Note/&gt; a [[South Slavic languages|south Slavic]] language, is unrelated to the Ancient Macedonian language. It is currently the subject of two major disputes. The first is over the name (alternative ways of referring to this language can be found in the [[#Terminology by group|terminology by group]] section and in the article [[Macedonian language naming dispute]]). The second dispute is over the existence of a Macedonian language distinct from [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]], the denial of which is a position supported by nationalist groups, Bulgarian and other linguists and also by many ordinary Bulgarians.&lt;ref name=lunt1986&gt;{{cite journal |last=Lunt |first=H. |year= 1986 | title=On Macedonian Nationality|journal=Slavic Review |volume=45 |issue=4 |pages=729–734 |doi=10.2307/2498347 |last2=Dogo |first2=Marco |jstor=2498347}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Modern Greek#Varieties|Macedonian]] is also the name of a dialect of [[Modern Greek]], a language of the [[Indo-European family]].

== Politics ==
{{See also|Macedonia naming dispute}}

The controversies in geographic, linguistic and demographic terms, are also manifested in international politics. Among the autonomous countries that were formed as a result of the breakup of [[Yugoslavia]] in the 1990s, was the (until then) subnational entity of the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]], by the official name of "Socialist Republic of Macedonia", the others being Serbia, [[Slovenia]], [[Croatia]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] and [[Montenegro]]. The peaceful break-away of that nation resulted in the change of its name to "Republic of Macedonia".

[[Loring Danforth]], a professor of anthropology at [[Bates College]], asserts that ethnic Macedonian nationalists, who are concerned with demonstrating the continuity between ancient and modern Macedonians, deny they are Slavs and claim to be the direct descendants of Alexander the Great and the ancient Macedonians. Danforth stresses, however, that the more moderate Macedonian position, publicly endorsed by [[Kiro Gligorov]], the first president of the Republic of Macedonia, is modern Macedonians have no relation to Alexander the Great, but are a Slavic people whose ancestors arrived in Macedonia in the sixth century AD. Proponents of both the extreme and the moderate Macedonian positions stress that the ancient Macedonians were a distinct non-Greek people. In addition to affirming the existence of the Macedonian nation, Macedonians are concerned with affirming the existence of a unique Macedonian language as well. They thus emphasize that the Macedonian language has a history dating to the Old Church Slavonic used by [[Saints Cyril and Methodius]] in the ninth century.&lt;ref name="Danforth_gate"&gt;{{cite book| title=How can a woman give birth to one Greek and one Macedonian? | url= http://www.gate.net/~mango/How_can_a_woman_give_birth.htm | work=The construction of national identity among immigrants to Australia from Northern Greece | first=Loring M. | last= Danforth |accessdate=26 December 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although ethnic Macedonians agree Macedonian minorities exist in Bulgaria and Greece and these minorities have been subjected to harsh policies of forced assimilation, there are two different positions with regard to what their future should be. These were summarized by Danforth:&lt;ref name="Danforth_gate"/&gt;{{#tag:ref|Most quotations within the text are from [[Evangelos Kofos]]: "Most precious jewels" from a [[Boston Globe]] article of 5 January 1993, the others from ''Nationalism and communism'', Thessalonica, 1964.|group=Note}}

They do, however, demand that Bulgaria and Greece recognize the existence of Macedonian minorities in their countries and grant them the basic human rights they deserve.}}

=== Greek nationalism ===
{{See also|Greek nationalism}}

Danforth describes the Greek position on Macedonia as follows: because Alexander the Great and the ancient Macedonians were Greeks, and because ancient and modern Greece are bound in an unbroken line of racial and cultural continuity, it is only Greeks who have the right to identify themselves as Macedonians. According to Danforth, this is why Greeks generally refer to Ethnic Macedonians as "Skopians", a practice comparable to calling Greeks "Athenians". Danforth asserts that the negation of Macedonian identity in Greek nationalist ideology focuses on three main points: the existence of a Macedonian nation, a Macedonian language, and a Macedonian minority in Greece. More specifically, Danforth says:&lt;ref name="Danforth_gate"/&gt;

{{blockquote|From the Greek nationalist perspective there cannot be a Macedonian nation since there has never been an independent Macedonian state: the Macedonian nation is an "artificial creation", an "invention", of Tito, who "baptized" a "mosaic of nationalities" with the Greek name "Macedonians". Similarly Greek nationalists claim that because the language spoken by the ancient Macedonians was Greek, the Slavic language spoken by the "Skopians" cannot be called "the Macedonian language." Greek sources generally refer to it as "the linguistic idiom of Skopje" and describe it as a corrupt and impoverished dialect of Bulgarian. Finally, the Greek government denies the existence of a Macedonian minority in northern Greece, claiming that there exists only a small group of "Slavophone Hellenes" or "bilingual Greeks", who speak Greek and "a local Slavic dialect" but have a "Greek national consciousness".}}

Thus from the Greek nationalist perspective the use of the term "Macedonian" by the "Slavs of Skopje" constitutes a "felony", an "act of plagiarism" against the Greek people. Greek nationalists believe that, by calling themselves "Macedonians", the ethnic Macedonians are "stealing" a Greek name, "embezzling" Greek cultural heritage, and "falsifying" Greek history.{{#tag:ref|Danforth quotes Kofos, telling a foreign reporter, "It is as if a robber came into my house and stole my most precious jewels—my history, my culture, my identity."&lt;ref name="Danforth_gate"/&gt;|group=Note}} Greek fears that the use of the name "Macedonia" by the ethnic Macedonians will inevitably lead to the assertion of irredentist claims to territory in Greek Macedonia are heightened by fairly recent historical events.{{#tag:ref|"During World War II Bulgaria occupied portions of northern Greece, while one of the specific goals of the founders of the People's Republic of Macedonia in 1944 was "the unification of the entire Macedonian nation", to be achieved by "the liberation of the other two segments" of Macedonia."&lt;ref name="Danforth_gate"/&gt;|group=Note}}

From a different point of view, Demetrius Andreas M.-A. Floudas, of [[Hughes Hall, Cambridge]], a leading commentator on the naming dispute from the Greek side, sums up this nationalistic reaction as follows: the Republic of Macedonia was accused of usurping the historical and cultural patrimony of Greece "in order to furnish a nucleus of national self-esteem for the new state and provide its citizens with a new, distinct, non-Bulgarian, non-Serbian, non-Albanian identity". The Republic emerged thus to Greek eyes as a country with a personality crisis, "a nondescript parasitic state" that lived off the history of its neighbours, because it allegedly lacked an illustrious past of its own, for the sake of achieving cohesion for what Greeks regarded as an "unhomogeneous little new nation". Floudas criticizes Greek stance as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Floudas|first=Demetrius Andreas|journal=Journal of Political and Military Sociology|volume=24|page=285|url=http://connection.ebscohost.com/c/articles/11160801/name-conflict-conflict-name-analysis-greeces-dispute-fyrom|title=A Name for a Conflict or a Conflict for a Name? An Analysis of Greece's Dispute with FYROM|accessdate=24 January 2007 | year=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{blockquote|What appeared to go unquestioned in Greece nevertheless was whether there was indeed substance in the claims of FYROM that their citizens do feel members of a distinct 'Macedonian' nationality. To answer this appropriately, neither the decades of persistent indoctrination [during Tito's time] should be left out of consideration, nor Greece's violent struggle since 1991 in contrast to her complacency for the 45 years before this. If it was a common bond that the people in Skopje wanted, they found it by claiming this name and rallying the whole population in a united resistance front under a common cause against pugnacious Greece. After this bitter and protracted struggle, even the ones in FYROM who might have not initially been infused with any distinct Macedonian ethnic identity must be feeling very Macedonian now, thanks to Greece}}

As of early 2008, the official position of Greece, adopted unanimously by the four largest political parties, has made a more moderate shift towards accepting a "composite name solution" (i.e. the use of the name "Macedonia" plus some qualifier), so as to disambiguate the former Yugoslav Republic from the Greek region of Macedonia and the wider geographic region of the same name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.mfa.gr/www.mfa.gr/en-US/Policy/Geographic+Regions/South-Eastern+Europe/Balkans/Bilateral+Relations/FYROM/FYROM+-+THE+NAME+ISSUE.htm |publisher=Hellenic Republic, Ministry of Foreign Affairs |accessdate=17 July 2006 |title=Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYROM)&amp;nbsp;— The Name Issue |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060708044400/http://www2.mfa.gr/www.mfa.gr/en-US/Policy/Geographic%2BRegions/South-Eastern%2BEurope/Balkans/Bilateral%2BRelations/FYROM/FYROM%2B-%2BTHE%2BNAME%2BISSUE.htm |archivedate=8 July 2006 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Skai News|url=http://www.skai.gr/master_story.php?id=74004|title=KKE about Kosovo&amp;nbsp;— FYROM|language=Greek|accessdate=3 June 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111002044531/http://www.skai.gr/master_story.php?id=74004|archivedate=2 October 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Terminology by group ==
All these controversies have led ethnic groups in Macedonia to use terms in conflicting ways. Despite the fact that these terms may not always be used in a [[pejorative]] way, they may be perceived as such by the ethnic group to which they are applied. Both Greeks and ethnic Macedonians generally use all terms deriving from ''Macedonia'' to describe their own regional or ethnic group, and have devised several other terms to disambiguate the other side, or the region in general.

Bulgarians and ethnic Macedonians seek to deny the self-identification of the [[Slavic-speakers of Greek Macedonia|Slavic speaking minority]] in northern Greece, which mostly self-identifies as Greek.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Shea|1997|p=125}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Certain terms are in use by these groups as outlined below. Any denial of self-identification by any side, or any attribution of Macedonia related terms by third parties to the other side, can be seen as highly offensive. General usage of these terms follows:

=== Bulgarian ===
* '''[[Grecomans|Gărkomani]]''' (Гъркомани) is a derogatory term used to refer to the largest portion of the Slavic-speaking minority of Macedonia in Greece who self-identify as Greeks.
* '''[[Macedonian Bulgarians|Macedonian]]''' (Македонец) is a person originating from the region of Macedonia&amp;nbsp;– the term has only regional, not ethnic meaning, and it usually means a Bulgarian, or a clarification is made (Greek, Albanian...).
* '''[[Macedonian language|Macedonian]]''' (Македонски) and the [[Slavic language (Greece)|Slavic dialects of Greece]] are considered dialects of Bulgarian by Bulgarian linguists; not independent languages or dialects of other languages (e.g. Serbian). This is also the popular view in Bulgaria. The Bulgarian government, therefore, has officially recognized the language merely as "the constitutional language of the Republic of Macedonia".&lt;ref name=bcb /&gt;&lt;ref name= BulLang&gt;{{cite press release | title = Article: Bulgaria Recognizes Macedonian Language | publisher = AIMpress Sofia&amp;nbsp;– Skopje | date = 22 February 2006| url = http://www.aimpress.ch/dyn/trae/archive/data/199902/90222-005-trae-sof.htm | accessdate = 25 July 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Translations are officially called "adaptations".
* '''[[Macedonism]]''' (Македонизъм) is the political ideology or simply views that the Slavs of Macedonia are an ethnic group separate from Bulgarians, with their own separate language, history and culture. It is also used to describe what Bulgarians view as the falsification of their history whether by Macedonian or foreign scholars who subscribe to the Macedonist point of view. It carries strong negative connotations.&lt;ref name=macedonism&gt;{{cite journal |last=Rychlík |first=Jan |year=2007|title=The Consciousness of the Slavonic Orthodox Population in Pirin Macedonia and the Identity of the Population of Moravia and Moravian Slovakia |journal=Sprawy Narodowościowe |volume= |issue=31 |pages=183–197 |id= |url=http://www.ceeol.com/aspx/issuedetails.aspx?issueid=e89e2e39-164b-4bd4-9632-b0ebc2cce969&amp;articleId=1eebae8c-34b9-42a4-8537-3089639fb54c |accessdate=11 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Macedonistics]]''' (Македонистика) is a term, generally synonymous with disciplines such as study of the origins of the Macedonian language and history of the Macedonian people conducted in the Republic of Macedonia and in former Yugoslavia. It is generally considered in Bulgaria to be a kind of [[pseudoscience]].
* '''[[Macedonism|Macedonist]]''' (Македонист) is a person (typically Macedonian Slav) who believes that Macedonian Slavs are not ethnic Bulgarians but a separate ethnic group, directly descended from the ancient Macedonians. It is a more negatively charged synonym of "Macedonian nationalist". More rarely it is used for someone associated with the study of the origins of the Macedonian language and history of the Macedonian people (not necessarily from the Republic of Macedonia or Yugoslavia), whose studies support the official historical doctrine of the Republic of Macedonia or former Yugoslavia.&lt;ref name=macedonism /&gt;
* '''[[Serbomans|Sărbomani]]''' (Сърбомани) is a derogatory term used to refer to people in the Republic of Macedonia self-identifying as Serbian, or having a pro-Serb orientation. It is also used pejoratively by Bulgarians to refer to Macedonians who refuse the Bulgarian national idea.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=P-1m1FLtrvsC&amp;pg=PA226&amp;dq=serbomans&amp;hl=bg&amp;ei=2BbjTuPEPImf-Qb79aXrBQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=serbomans&amp;f=false Contested Ethnic Identity: The Case of Macedonian Immigrants in Toronto, 1900-1996, Chris Kostov, Peter Lang, 2010, p. 226.], {{ISBN|3-0343-0196-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Old Bulgarian]]''' (Старобългарски) is the name Bulgarians give to the [[Old Church Slavonic language]] used in the [[Ohrid Literary School]] among others. In contrast, Old Church Slavonic is rarely referred to by ethnic Macedonians as "Old Macedonian" or "Old Slavic".&lt;ref name= OldChurchSlav&gt;{{harvp|Shea|1997|p=198}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Ministry of Religious Affairs and Culture''' ({{Lang-my|သာသနာရေးနှင့်ယဉ်ကျေးမှုဝန်ကြီးဌာန}}, abbreviated '''MORAC''') administers the religious affairs, cultural affairs and historical and archaeology research efforts of [[Myanmar]] (formerly Burma). The Department of Religious Affairs purification, perpetuation, promotion and propagation of the [[Theravada]] Buddhist Sasana and promotes Myanmar traditional customs and culture.&lt;ref name="Self3"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mora.gov.mm/mora_ministry1.aspx|title=The Ministry of Religious Affairs|publisher=Ministry Of Religious Affairs|accessdate=19 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

==History==

The Ministry of Culture was established on 16 March 1952 as the Ministry of Union Cultures, and later renamed the Ministry of Culture on 15 March 1972.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.modins.net/myanmarinfo/ministry/culture.htm|title=Ministry Of Culture|date=2002|work=Myanmar Online Data Information Network Solutions|accessdate=27 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ministry of Religious Affairs (MORA) came into being before the [[Union of Myanmar]] regained its Independence in 1947. On 2 March 1962, the [[Union Revolutionary Council|Revolutionary Council]] government reorganised all ministries. The Ministry of Religious Affairs became a department of the Ministry of Home and Religious Affairs. On 18 September 1988. the [[State Law and Order Restoration Council]] (SLORC) formed the Department for the Promotion and Propagation of the Sasana, also under the Ministry of Home and Religious Affairs. On 20 March 1992. the ministries of Home Affairs and Religious Affairs were separated. A cabinet meeting on 26 June 1998 confirmed that the [[International Theravada Buddhist Missionary University]] would be formed under MORA.&lt;ref name="Self2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mora.gov.mm/mora_ministry1.aspx|title=The Ministry of Religious Affairs|publisher=Ministry Of Religious Affairs|accessdate=19 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; MORA's motto was a [[Pali]] phrase "''Buddha sāsanaṃ ciraṃ tiṭṭhatu''" ({{my|ဗုဒ္ဓသာသနံစိရံတိဋ္ဌတု}}), which translates as "Long Live the Buddhist Sasana." 

On 1 April 2016, the Ministry of Religious Affairs and Ministry of Culture were combined to form the Ministry of Religious Affairs and Culture, as part of a government downsizing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.mmtimes.com/national-news/nay-pyi-taw/19532-nld-reduces-government-ministries.html|title=NLD reduces government ministries|work=The Myanmar Times|access-date=2018-10-02|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="45510">'''Natural burial''' is the interment of the [[cadaver|body]] of a [[Death|dead]] person in the [[soil]] in a manner that does not inhibit [[decomposition]] but allows the body to [[biogeochemical cycle|recycle]] naturally. It is an alternative to other contemporary Western burial methods and funerary customs.

== Overview==
[[File:Eloise woods 2011.jpg|thumb|A natural burial grave site. The existing landscape is modified as little as possible. Only flat stone markers are allowed.]]
The body may be prepared without chemical [[preservatives]] or disinfectants such as [[embalming]] [[Embalming chemicals|fluid]], which might destroy the microbial [[decomposer]]s that break the body down. It may be buried in a [[biodegradable]] [[coffin]], casket, or [[shroud]]. The grave does not use a [[burial vault (enclosure)|burial vault]] or outer burial container that would prevent the body's contact with soil. The grave should be shallow enough to allow microbial activity similar to that found in [[composting]]. Natural burials can take place both on private land (subject to regulations) and in any [[cemetery]] that will accommodate the vault-free technique.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}

While all natural burials seek to prevent environmental damage done by conventional techniques, some go a step further by using burial fees to acquire land to restore native habitat and save endangered species.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Holden|first=Matthew H.|last2=McDonald-Madden|first2=Eve|title=Conservation from the Grave: Human Burials to Fund the Conservation of Threatened Species|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/conl.12421/abstract|journal=Conservation Letters|language=en|pages=n/a–n/a|doi=10.1111/conl.12421|issn=1755-263X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such land management techniques are called "conservation burials."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  In addition to [[restoration ecology]], and [[habitat conservation]] projects,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; others have proposed alternative natural uses of the land such as [[sustainable agriculture]] and [[permaculture]], to maintain the burial area in perpetuity. Landscaping methods may accelerate or slow down the decomposition rate of bodies, depending on the soil system.

The first official conservation burial was established in the United States, however Natural Burial Grounds have been used previously in UK and the practice matches the methods used in many ancient and indigenous cultures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Harker|first=A|date=2012|title=Landscapes of the Dead: An Argument for Conservation Burial.|url=https://escholarship.org/content/qt7br0d6c3/qt7br0d6c3.pdf|journal=Berkeley Planning Journal|volume=25|pages=15–159|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Embalming ==
Many [[funeral director]]s encourage a [[Viewing (funeral)|viewing]] of a dead body at a commercial [[funeral home]] as part of a "package" that the family of the deceased pay for, without knowing that it is optional.&lt;ref name="abc.net.au"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-11-27/natural-death-movement-hashtag-no-coffin/6981946|title=#nocoffin: the natural death movement|work=ABC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; The primary purpose of [[embalming]] is to delay [[decomposition]] long enough to allow the body to be viewed.

In many countries, the law requires that dead bodies be chilled with [[dry ice]] or mechanical refrigeration to prevent microbial growth, though there are no laws mandating embalming, contrary to popular belief. Many cultures around the world use no artificial cooling at all, and bodies are regularly held for several days before their final disposal.

Special circumstances, such as an extended time between death and burial, or the transportation of remains on commercial flights (which often require unembalmed bodies to travel in expensive specialized containers), may necessitate embalming.

The most common embalming fluid is composed of organic chemicals and contains 5–29% [[formaldehyde]], ethanol and water. This solution is biodegradable in time, but it cross-links proteins found in tissue-cell membranes, slowing down bacterial decomposition and inhibiting the body's breakdown in the earth. The ability of embalming fluid to contaminate soil or water tables has not been studied thoroughly. In alkaline soils, formaldehyde would be broken down through the [[Cannizzaro reaction]] and become [[urotropin]], but not all soils are alkaline.

Formaldehyde is highly toxic to all animals, and is "known to be a human carcinogen".&lt;ref name="Harris"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Harris|first1=Gardiner|title=Government Says 2 Common Materials Pose Risk of Cancer|date=10 June 2011|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/11/health/11cancer.html|publisher=New York Times|accessdate=2011-06-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="12Report2011"&gt;{{cite web|author=[[National Toxicology Program]]|title=12th Report on Carcinogens|date=10 June 2011|publisher=[[National Toxicology Program]]|url=http://ntp.niehs.nih.gov/index.cfm?objectid=72016262-BDB7-CEBA-FA60E922B18C2540|accessdate=2011-06-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="roc2011"&gt;{{cite web|author=[[National Toxicology Program]]|title=Report On Carcinogens – Twelfth Edition – 2011|date=10 June 2011|url=http://ntp.niehs.nih.gov/ntp/roc/twelfth/roc12.pdf|publisher=[[National Toxicology Program]]|format=PDF|accessdate=2011-06-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author = Michael Hauptmann| date = December 16, 2009 |title = Mortality From Lymphohematopoietic Malignancies and Brain Cancer Among Embalmers Exposed to Formaldehyde | journal = Journal of the National Cancer Institute | volume = 101 | issue = 24 | pages = 1696–1708| publisher = Oxford University Press |url=http://jnci.oxfordjournals.org/content/101/24/1696.abstract |doi = 10.1093/jnci/djp464|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is implicated in cancer, [[Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis]], disorders of the nervous system, and other ailments. The U.S. [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] has the power to require embalmers to wear respirators.

== Coffins ==
Natural coffins are made from materials that readily biodegrade. Ideally, the materials are easily renewed or recycled and require less energy for their production.

Coffins (tapered-shoulder shape) and caskets (rectangular) are made from a variety of materials, most of them not biodegradable. 80–85% of the caskets sold for burial in North America in 2006 were of stamped steel. Solid wood and particle board (chipboard) coffins with hardwood veneers account for 10–15% of sales, and fiberglass and alternative materials such as woven fiber make up the rest. In Australia 85–90% of coffins are solid wood and particle board.{{Citation needed |date=June 2018}}

Most traditional caskets in the UK are made from chipboard covered in a thin veneer. Handles are usually plastic designed to look like brass. Chipboard requires glue to stick the wood particles together. Some glues that are used, such as those that contain formaldehyde, are feared to cause pollution when they are burned during cremation or when degrading in the ground.{{Citation needed |date=May 2012}} However, not all engineered wood products are produced using formaldehyde glues.

Caskets and coffins are often manufactured using exotic and even endangered species of wood, and are designed to prevent decomposition. While there are generally no restrictions on the type of coffin used, most sites encourage the use of environmentally friendly coffins made from materials like cane, bamboo, wicker or [[Corrugated fiberboard|fiberboard]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.plasticstoday.com/articles/sustainable-caskets-designed-for-end-of-life-151109|title=Plastics Today|work=plasticstoday.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="gazettenet.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gazettenet.com/news/19318859-95/green-burial-movement-advocates-alternative-to-conventional-interment|title=Green burial movement advocates alternative to conventional interment|work=GazetteNet.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/eco-afterlife-green-buria/|title=Eco-Afterlife: Green Burial Options|work=scientificamerican.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/1730190.stm Bamboo Coffins "Coffin-maker resurrects tradition"], from BBC Business News, published 2001-12-28&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thelinknewspaper.ca/article/dying-sustainably|title=Dying Sustainably|work=thelinknewspaper.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt; A weight bearing shroud is another option.&lt;ref name="abc.net.au"/&gt;

== Memorialization ==
Natural burial grounds employ a variety of methods of memorialization. Families that bury their loved ones in [[nature preserve]]s can record the [[GPS]] coordinates of the location where they are buried, without using physical markers.&lt;ref name="gazettenet.com"/&gt; Some natural burial sites use flat wooden plaques, or a name written on a natural rock. Many families plant trees, or other native plants near the grave to provide a living memorial.

==Alternative methods of burial==

Alternatives to ground burials include: burial in a coral reef, [[sky burial]] and [[burial at sea]].

===Coral reefs===

Cremated remains are sometimes placed inside concrete coral reef balls, and ceremoniously placed in the sea as part of a reef ecosystem. These balls are used to repair damage to [[coral reefs]], and to provide new habitat for fish and other sea life.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/06/29/reef-ball-burial-coral-reef_n_3512600.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sky burial===
{{main article|Sky burial}}

In some parts of [[Tibet]] and [[Mongolia]], a person's remains are fed to [[vultures]] in a burial known as [[Sky burial]]. This is seen as being good to the environment as well as good karma in [[Buddhism]].&lt;ref&gt;http://people.howstuffworks.com/culture-traditions/cultural-traditions/sky-burial.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2376190/Chopped-fed-vultures-glimpse-closely-guarded-tradition-Tibetan-sky-funeral.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===Burial at sea===
{{main article|Burial at sea}}

Burial at sea is seen as a natural burial if done in a way that benefits the environment, and without formaldehyde. Some organizations specialize in natural burial at sea (in a shroud), allowing the body to decompose or be consumed by animals.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.motherjones.com/environment/2011/05/bin-laden-burial-at-sea&lt;/ref&gt;

== Environmental issues with conventional burial ==
Each year, 22,500 cemeteries across the United States bury approximately:&lt;ref&gt;(Compiled from statistics by Casket and Funeral Association of America, Cremation Association of North America, Doric Inc., The Rainforest Action Network, and Mary Woodsen, Pre-Posthumous Society){{Full citation needed|date=May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*30&amp;nbsp;million [[board feet]] (70,000&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) of [[hardwood]] caskets
*90,272&amp;nbsp;tons of steel caskets
*14,000&amp;nbsp;tons of steel vaults
*2,700&amp;nbsp;tons of copper and [[bronze]] caskets
*1,636,000&amp;nbsp;tons of [[reinforced concrete]] vaults
*827,060 US gallons (3,130&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) of [[embalming fluid]], which usually includes formaldehyde.&lt;ref&gt;Embalming fluid chemically changes in the act of preserving the body and is not largely present as a fluid. This figure refers to embalming fluid before it is introduced to the body.&lt;/ref&gt;

When formaldehyde is used for embalming, it breaks down, and the chemicals released into the ground after burial and ensuing decomposition are inert. The problems with the use of formaldehyde and its constituent components in natural burial are the exposure of mortuary workers to it&lt;ref&gt;http://www.champion-newera.com/CHAMP.PDFS/encyclo655.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; and the destruction of the decomposer microbes necessary for breakdown of the body in the soil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/0,1518,527134,00.html |title=Germany's Tired Graveyards: A Rotten Way to Go? – SPIEGEL ONLINE – News – International |publisher=Spiegel.de |date= |accessdate=2011-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Locations ==
Natural burial has been practiced for thousands of years, but has been interrupted in modern times by new methods such as vaults, liners, embalming, and mausoleums that mitigate the decomposition process. In the late 19th century Sir Francis Seymour Hayden proposed "earth to earth burial" in a pamphlet of the same name, as an alternative to both [[cremation]] and the slow putrefaction of encased corpses.

=== United Kingdom ===

The Association of Natural Burial Grounds (ANBG) was established by The Natural Death Centre charity in 1994. It aims to help people to establish sites, to provide guidance to natural burial ground operators, to represent its members, and to provide a Code of Conduct for members. The NDC also publishes ''The Natural Death Handbook''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.anbg.co.uk/ |title=The Association of Natural Burial Grounds (UK) official website |publisher=Anbg.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2011-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first woodland burial ground in the UK was created in 1993 at Carlisle Cemetery and is called ''The Woodland Burial''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | author = Carlisle City Council | title = The History of Carlisle Cemetery | url = http://www.carlisle.gov.uk/leisure_and_culture/parks_and_open_spaces/parks_and_open_spaces/carlisle_cemetery/carlisle_cemetery.aspx | accessdate = 3 May 2012 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150610210746/http://www.carlisle.gov.uk/leisure_and_culture/parks_and_open_spaces/parks_and_open_spaces/carlisle_cemetery/carlisle_cemetery.aspx | archivedate = 10 June 2015 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nearly 300 dedicated natural burial grounds have been created in the UK.

=== Canada ===
Each [[province]] and territory within [[Canada]] has its own resources and regulations for handling death&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cindea.ca/resources-post.html#care|title=CINDEA|website=www.cindea.ca|access-date=2017-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Disposal of human corpses|disposal of the body]].

Eco-friendly funeral practices in Canada can include:

* [[Burial at sea]]
* Tree planting&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://globalnews.ca/news/2558634/biodegradable-burial-pods-will-turn-you-into-a-tree-when-you-die/|title=Biodegradable burial pods will turn you into a tree when you die|work=Global News|access-date=2017-03-29|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Environmental certificates are offered to cemeteries, funeral homes, and product manufacturers involved in the funeral industry. These certificates would allow consumers to distinguish between the three different levels of green burial grounds and their appropriate standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://greenburialcouncil.org/home/what-is-green-burial/|title=What is green burial? {{!}} Green Burial Council|website=greenburialcouncil.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Green Burial Council also offers information on the types of coffins, [[urn]]s, and embalming tools that would fall under the eco-friendly category&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://greenburialcouncil.org/home/plan-for-your-green-burial/certified-products/|title=Certified Products {{!}} Green Burial Council|website=greenburialcouncil.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; and be available for North American consumers.

Duffin Meadows Cemetery is located in Pickering, Ontario, and is attached to the original traditional cemetery.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.naturalburialassoc.ca/new-natural-burial-ground-in-ontario-duffin-meadows-cemetery/|title=New natural burial ground in Ontario: Duffin Meadows Cemetery  –   Natural Burial Association|last=www.site5.com|website=www.naturalburialassoc.ca|language=en-US|access-date=2017-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cemetery offers natural burials for individuals who have been embalmed to eco-friendly standards, then interred using biodegradable shrouds and caskets.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mountpleasantgroup.com/en-CA/Locations/Cemeteries/Duffin-Meadows.aspx|title=Duffin Meadows Cemetery|website=www.mountpleasantgroup.com|access-date=2017-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Grave sites will be left to grow over naturally, meaning grass will not be mowed and the placement of [[artificial flower]]s and other markers will not be allowed.

=== Australia ===
There are a number of different natural burial parks across Australia, each of them slightly different in what they offer. One of the more advanced park is Lake Macquarie Memorial Park, on the Central Coast of New South Wales which contains a Natural Memorial reserve,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.lakemacquariecrem.com.au/memorials/natural-memorial-reserve|title=Natural Memorial Reserve|website=www.lakemacquariecrem.com.au|language=en|access-date=2017-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; dedicated to natural Burials.

=== New Zealand ===
New Zealand's Natural Burial organisation was started in 1999 by Mark Blackham.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.stuff.co.nz/dominion-post/news/wellington/471264/Natural-cemetery-promises-regeneration&lt;/ref&gt; It is a not-for-profit organization that advocates for natural cemeteries, promotes the concept to the public, and certifies cemeteries, funeral directors and caskets for use in participating cemeteries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.naturalburials.co.nz/ Natural Burials], New Zealand&lt;/ref&gt;

The first natural cemetery in New Zealand was established in 2008 in the capital, Wellington,&lt;ref&gt;[[Wellington City Council]], 'Wellington's new Natural Cemetery officially opened by Mayor Kerry Prendergast'. 30 May 2008. http://www.wellington.govt.nz/news/display-item.php?id=3217&lt;/ref&gt; as a partnership between the Wellington City Council and Natural Burials. It is the nation's biggest natural cemetery, covering approx 2 hectares, and home to 120 burials (April 2015).

More natural cemeteries have since been set up by between Natural Burials and the council authorities in [[New Plymouth]] in 2011,&lt;ref name="stuff"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/taranaki-daily-news/news/4885318/Natural-burial-plots-available|title=Natural burial plots available &amp;#124; Stuff.co.nz|publisher=stuff.co.nz|accessdate=2014-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[Otaki, New Zealand|Otaki]] in 2012.&lt;ref name="stuff2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/dominion-post/news/local-papers/kapiti-observer/7019331/Final-rest-the-natural-way|title=Natural burial site opened &amp;#124; Stuff.co.nz|publisher=stuff.co.nz|accessdate=2014-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Marlborough in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marlborough.govt.nz/Your-Council/News-Notices/Media-Releases/Marlboroughs-First-Natural-Burial.aspx|title=Marlborough's First Natural Burial|work=marlborough.govt.nz}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other councils have set up small natural burial zones: Marsden Valley in 2011, Motueka in 2012,&lt;ref name="stuff3"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/nelson-mail/features/weekend/7556969/Its-about-dying-naturally|title=Environmentally friendly natural burials &amp;#124; Stuff.co.nz|publisher=stuff.co.nz|accessdate=2014-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Hamilton in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hamilton.govt.nz/our-services/cemetery-services/burialservices/Documents/Forest%20Grove%20Natural%20Burial%20Area%20website%20brochure.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Although these have all based on the approach used by Natural Burials, they have not been certified by the organisation.

=== United States ===
&lt;br&gt;The Green Burial Council (GBC) is an independent, tax-exempt, nonprofit organization that aims to encourage [[sustainability]] in the interment industry and to use burial as a means of [[ecological restoration]] and landscape conservation. Founded in 2005, the GBC has been stewarded by individuals representing the environmental/conservation community, consumer organizations, academia, the deathcare industry, and such organizations and institutions as [[The Nature Conservancy]], [[The Trust for Public Land]], AARP, and the University of Colorado. The organization established the nation's first certifiable standards for cemeteries, funeral providers, burial product manufacturers, and cremation facilities. As of 2013, there are a total of 37 burial grounds certified by the Green Burial Council in 23 states and British Columbia. A cemetery becomes certified by demonstrating compliance with stringent established standards for a given category. Ramsey Creek Preserve mentioned below is certified by the GBC. Conventional funeral providers in thirty-nine states now offer the burial package approved by the Green Burial Council.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;'''California:''' &lt;br&gt;Most of the {{convert|32|acre|m2|adj=on}} Fernwood Burial Ground, adjacent to the [[Golden Gate National Recreation Area]] in [[Mill Valley]], California, is set aside for natural burial, with no tombstones or caskets.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Purissima Cemetery &lt;ref&gt; {{cite web | author = Ed Bixby | url = http://www.steelmantowncemetery.com/purissima.html | title=Purissima Cemetery | publisher=steelmantowncemetery.com | accessdate = 2018-02-20}} &lt;/ref&gt; located in [[Half Moon Bay]], [[California]] is a [[natural burial]] [[cemetery]] located south of [[Half Moon Bay]] California Operated by Steelmantown Cemetery.

== Religious practices ==
Jewish law forbids embalming for traditional burials, which it considers to be desecration of the body. The body is ritually washed by select members of the Jewish community, wrapped in either a linen or muslin sheet, and placed in an all-wood casket. The casket must not have any metal in it, and it often has holes in the bottom to ensure that it and the cadaver rapidly decompose and return to the earth. Burial vaults are not used unless required by the cemetery. In Israel, Jews are buried without a casket, in just the shroud.{{Citation needed |date=June 2018}}

Islamic law instructs that the deceased be washed and buried with only a wrapping of white cloth to preserve dignity. The cloth is sometimes perfumed, but as in natural burial, no chemical preservatives or embalming fluid are used, nor is there a burial vault, coffin or casket. There is no legal requirements for using a coffin in the UK and a body can be buried in a cloth if desired.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Five laws about the dead that may spook you |url=http://qpol.qub.ac.uk/laws-about-dead/ |website=QPol - Policy Engagement at Queen's |publisher=Queen's University Belfast |accessdate=23 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In the media ==
Toward the end of its final season in 2005, the HBO series ''[[Six Feet Under (TV series)|Six Feet Under]]'' prominently featured natural burial.

2014 documentary ''A Will for the Woods'' explores natural burial, primarily through the lens of one terminally-ill, North Carolina man's decision to have one.

The '''Nazca Lines''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|n|æ|z|k|ɑː}} are a group of very large [[Trench|trenches]] in the [[Nazca Plain|Nazca Desert]], in southern [[Peru]]. They were created between 500 [[Common Era|BCE]] and 500 [[Common Era|CE]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.go2peru.com/peru_guide/nazca/nazca_lines.htm|title=Nazca Lines|date=2017-02-22|work=Guía Go2peru|access-date=2018-10-29|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These [[Geoglyph|geoglyphs]] are 10 to 15 cm (4 to 6 in) deep, and between 0.4 and 1.1 km (.2  and .7 mi) wide. Their combined length is over 1,300 km (808 mi), and cover an area of about 50 sq km (19 sq mi).

They were made by scraping off&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nationalgeographic.com/archaeology-and-history/archaeology/nasca-lines/|title=The Nasca Lines Are One of Peru's Mysteries|date=2010-11-08|access-date=2018-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; the top layer of reddish-brown [[iron oxide]]-coated pebbles to reveal a yellow-grey subsoil.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

Some of the Nazca lines form shapes that are best seen from the air (~1,500 ft), though they are visible from the surrounding foothills and other high places.&lt;ref name="GardnerCroix1991"&gt;''[https://books.google.com/books?id=mYPuAAAAMAAJ Gardner's Art Through the Ages: Ancient, medieval, and non-European art]''.

The largest ones are about 370 m (1,200&amp;nbsp;ft) long.&lt;ref name="natgeo"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://science.nationalgeographic.com/science/archaeology/nasca-lines/|title=Nasca Lines – The Sacred Landscape|last1=Golomb|first1=Jason|website=National Geographic|publisher=National Geographic|accessdate=23 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The figures vary in complexity. Hundreds are simple lines and [[geometric shape]]s; more than 70 are [[zoomorphic]] designs of animals such as a hummingbird, spider, fish, llama, jaguar, monkey, lizard, dog and a human. Other shapes include trees and flowers.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Scholars differ in interpreting the purpose of the designs, but in general, they ascribe religious significance to them.&lt;ref name="Selin2013"&gt;Helaine Selin.

Because of its isolation and the dry, windless, stable [[Climate of Peru|climate of the plateau]], the lines have mostly been preserved naturally. Extremely rare changes in weather may temporarily alter the general designs. As of 2012, the lines are said to have been deteriorating because of an influx of [[squatters]] inhabiting the lands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Taj |first=Mitra |date=August 15, 2012 |title=Pigs and squatters threaten Peru's Nazca lines |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/08/15/us-peru-nazca-squatters-idUSBRE87E0R520120815 |work=[[Reuters]] |accessdate=August 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Location ==
The high, arid plateau stretches more than {{convert|80|km|mi|abbr=on}} between the towns of [[Nazca]] and [[Palpa, Peru|Palpa]] on the ''[[Pampas]] de Jumana'', approximately {{convert|400|km|mi|abbr=on}} south of [[Lima]], roughly matching the main PE-1S [[Pan-American Highway#Ecuador, Peru, Chile, Argentina and Paraguay|Panamericana Sur]]. The main concentration is in a 10 by 4 km (6 mi by 2 mi) rectangle, south of ''San Miguel de la Pascana'' hamlet. In this area, the most notable geoglyphs are visible.

Although some local geoglyphs resemble [[Paracas culture|Paracas motifs]], scholars believe the Nazca Lines were created by the [[Nazca culture]].

In 1994, they were designated as a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]].

==History==
The first published mention of the Nazca Lines was by [[Pedro Cieza de León]] in his book of 1553, and he mistook them for [[trail blazing|trail markers]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=w3dUAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=RA2-PT84#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false page 141 Pedro Cieza de León, ''La Chronica del Peru'' (The chronicle of Peru)], (Antwerp, (Belgium): Martin Nucio, 1554), p. 141. Note: Cieza discussed the Nazca region of Peru and said that ''"y por algunas partes delos arenales se veen señales, paraque atinen el camino que han de lleuar"'' ("and in some parts of the desert are seen signals, so that they [i.e., the Indians] find the path that has to be taken").&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1586, Luis Monzón reported having seen ancient ruins in Peru, including the remains of "roads".&lt;ref&gt;Luis Monzón (1586) "Descripcion de la tierra del repartimiento de los rucanas antamarcas de la corona real, jurisdicion de la ciudad de Guamanga. año de 1586." in:   Marcos Jiménez de la Espada, ed., ''Relaciones geográficas de Indias: Peru'', volume 1 (Madrid, Spain:  Manuel G. Hernandez, 1881), pp. 197–216.  On [https://books.google.com/books?id=35oaAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA210#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false page 210], Munzón notes seeing ancient ruins, including ''"y hay señales de calles"'' ("and there are signs of streets"). Munzón asked elderly Indians about the ruins. They told him that before the Incas, a people whom ''"llamaron ''viracochas''"'' ("they called ''viracochas''") inhabited the area, and ''"A éstos les hacian caminos, que hoy dia son vistos, tan anchos como una calle"'' ("To those [places] they made paths, that are seen today, as wide as a street").&lt;/ref&gt; Although the lines were partially visible from the nearby hills, the first to report them were Peruvian military and civilian pilots. 

In 1927 the Peruvian archaeologist  Toribio Mejía Xesspe spotted them while he was hiking through the foothills. He discussed them at a conference in Lima in 1939.&lt;ref&gt;Mejía Xesspe, Toribio (1939) "Acueductos y caminos antiguos de la hoya del Río Grande de Nazca" (Aqueducts and ancient roads of the Rio Grand valley in Nazca), ''Actas y Trabajos Cientificos del 27 Congreso Internacional de Americanistas'' (Proceedings and scientific works of the 27th international congress of American anthropologists), '''1''': 559–569.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Paul Kosok]], an American historian from [[Long Island University]], is credited as the first scholar to study the Nazca Lines at length. In Peru in 1940–41 to study ancient irrigation systems, he flew over the lines and realized one was in the shape of a bird. Another chance observation helped him see how lines converged at the [[winter solstice]] in the Southern Hemisphere. He began to study how the lines might have been created, as well as to try to determine their purpose. He was joined by archeologist Richard P. Schaedel from the United States, and [[Maria Reiche]], a German mathematician and archaeologist from Lima, to help determine the purpose of the Nazca Lines. They proposed one of the earliest reasons for the existence of the figures: to be markers on the horizon to show where the sun and other [[Astronomical object|celestial bodies]] rose on significant dates. Archaeologists, historians, and mathematicians have all tried to determine the purpose of the lines.

Determining how they were made has been easier than determining why they were made. Scholars have theorized the Nazca people could have used simple tools and surveying equipment to construct the lines. Archaeological surveys have found wooden stakes in the ground at the end of some lines, which supports this theory. One such stake was [[carbon-dated]] and was the basis for establishing the age of the design complex.

Refuting the hypothesis of [[Erich von Däniken]] that the lines had to have been created by "[[ancient astronauts]]", prominent skeptic [[Joe Nickell]] has reproduced the figures using tools and technology available to the Nazca people. ''[[Scientific American]]'' called his work "remarkable in its exactness" when compared to the existing lines.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=1V-BIdlc9YEC&amp;pg=PA6&amp;dq=joe+nickell+nazca+lines&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=nazca&amp;f=false Nickell, Joe (2005). ''Unsolved History: Investigating Mysteries of the Past''], The University Press of Kentucky {{ISBN|978-0-8131-9137-9}}, pp. 13–16&lt;/ref&gt; With careful planning and simple technologies, Nickell proved that a small team of people could recreate even the largest figures within days, without any aerial assistance.&lt;ref name="reece"/&gt;

Most of the lines are formed on the ground by a shallow trench with a depth between {{convert|10|and|15|cm|in|abbr=on|sigfig=1}}. Such trenches were made by removing the reddish-brown [[iron oxide]]-coated pebbles that cover the surface of the Nazca Desert. When this gravel is removed, the light-colored clay earth exposed in the bottom of the trench produces lines and contrasts sharply in color and tone with the surrounding land surface. This sublayer contains high amounts of [[Lime (material)|lime]] which, with the morning mist, hardens to form a protective layer that shields the lines from winds, thereby preventing [[erosion]].

The Nazca "drew" several hundred simple, but huge, curvilinear animal and human figures by this technique. In total, the [[earthworks (engineering)|earthwork]] project is huge and complex: the area encompassing the lines is nearly {{convert|450|km2|mi2|abbr=on}}, and the largest figures can span nearly 370 m (1,200&amp;nbsp;ft).&lt;ref name="natgeo"/&gt; Some figures have been measured: the hummingbird is {{cvt|93|m|ft}} long, the condor is {{cvt|134|m|ft}}, the monkey is {{cvt|93|by|58|m|ft}}, and the spider is {{cvt|47|m|ft}}. The extremely dry, windless, and constant climate of the Nazca region has preserved the lines well. This desert is one of the driest on Earth and maintains a temperature near {{cvt|25|C|F}} year round. The lack of wind has helped keep the lines uncovered and visible.

The discovery of two new small figures was announced in early 2011 by a Japanese team from [[Yamagata University]]. One of these resembles a human head and is dated to the early period of Nazca culture or earlier, and the other, undated, is an animal. In March 2012, the university announced a new research center would be opened at the site in September 2012 to study the area for the next 15 years. The team has been conducting field work there since 2006, when it had found approximately 100 new [[geoglyph]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Team finds more Peru geoglyphs|url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/text/nn20110120a6.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120715002321/http://www.japantimes.co.jp/text/nn20110120a6.html|archivedate=2012-07-15|accessdate=9 April 2012|newspaper=Japan Times|date=Jan 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=University to open center at Nazca Lines|url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/text/nn20120322b3.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120326155532/http://www.japantimes.co.jp/text/nn20120322b3.html|archivedate=2012-03-26|accessdate=9 April 2012|newspaper=Japan Times|date=March 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Earlier Paracas geoglyphs ==

The [[Paracas culture]] is considered the precursor that influenced the development of the Nazca Lines. In 2018, drones used by archaeologists revealed many geoglyphs in the Palpa province that are being assigned to the Paracas culture. Many predate the associated Nazca lines by a thousand years. Some demonstrate a significant difference in the subjects and locations, such as some being on hillsides.&lt;ref&gt;Greshko, Michael, [https://news.nationalgeographic.com/2018/04/new-nasca-nazca-lines-discovery-peru-archaeology/ Exclusive: "Massive Ancient Drawings Found in Peruvian Desert"], ''National Geographic'', 5 April 2018&lt;/ref&gt; Their co-discoverer, Peruvian archaeologist Luis Jaime Castillo Butters, indicates that many of these newly discovered geoglyphs represent warriors.

==Purpose==
[[file:Nazca Lines SPOT 1311.jpg|right|thumb|Nazca Lines seen from [[SPOT Satellite]]]]
[[Anthropologist]]s, [[ethnologist]]s, and [[archaeologist]]s have studied the ancient Nazca culture to try to determine the purpose of the lines and figures. One hypothesis is that the Nazca people created them to be seen by deities in the sky. 

[[Paul Kosok]] and [[Maria Reiche]] advanced a purpose related to [[astronomy]] and [[cosmology]], as has been common in other cultures: the lines were intended to act as a kind of [[observatory]], to point to the places on the distant horizon where the sun and other celestial bodies rose or set in the solstices. Many prehistoric [[indigenous peoples|indigenous]] cultures in the Americas and elsewhere constructed earthworks that combined such astronomical sighting with their religious cosmology, as did the late [[Mississippian culture]] at [[Cahokia]] and other sites in present-day United States. Another example is [[Stonehenge]] in England.

[[Gerald Hawkins]] and [[Anthony Aveni]], experts in [[archaeoastronomy]], concluded in 1990 that the evidence was insufficient to support such an astronomical explanation.&lt;ref name="isbn0-8160-2581-9"&gt;{{cite book |author=Cameron, Ian |title=Kingdom of the Sun God: A History of the Andes and Their People |publisher=Facts on File |location=New York |date=1990 |page=46 |isbn=0-8160-2581-9 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Maria Reiche asserted that some or all of the figures represented [[constellation]]s. By 1998, Phyllis B. Pitluga, a protégé of Reiche and senior astronomer at the [[Adler Planetarium]] in [[Chicago]], had concluded that the animal figures were "representations of heavenly shapes". According to ''[[The New York Times]]'', "she contends they are not shapes of constellations, but of what might be called ''counter constellations'', the irregularly-shaped dark patches within the twinkling expanse of the [[Milky Way]]."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1998/06/15/world/maria-reiche-95-keeper-of-an-ancient-peruvian-puzzle-dies.html?pagewanted=all ROBERT McG. THOMAS Jr, "Maria Reiche, 95, Keeper of an Ancient Peruvian Puzzle, Dies"], ''The New York Times,'' 15 June 1998&lt;/ref&gt; Anthony Aveni criticized her work for failing to account for all the details.

Alberto Rossell Castro (1977) proposed a multi-functional interpretation of the geoglyphs. He classified them into three groups: the first appeared to be tracks connected to irrigation and field division, the second are lines that are axes connected with mounds and cairns, and the third was linked to astronomical interpretations.&lt;ref&gt; Rossel Castro, Albert. (1977) ''Arqueología Sur del Perú'', Lima: Editorial Universo&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1985, archaeologist [[Johan Reinhard]] published archaeological, [[ethnographic]], and historical data demonstrating that worship of mountains and other water sources predominated in Nazca religion and economy from ancient to recent times. He theorized that the lines and figures were part of religious practices involving the worship of deities associated with the availability of water, which directly related to the success and productivity of crops. He interpreted the lines as sacred paths leading to places where these deities could be worshiped. The figures were symbols representing animals and objects meant to invoke the aid of the deities in supplying water. The precise meanings of many of the individual geoglyphs remain unknown.

[[Henri Stierlin]], a Swiss [[art historian]] specializing in Egypt and the Middle East, published a book in 1983 linking the Nazca Lines to the production of ancient textiles that archeologists have found wrapping [[mummies]] of the [[Paracas culture]].&lt;ref&gt;Stierlin (1983)&lt;/ref&gt; He contended that the people may have used the lines and trapezes as giant, primitive [[loom]]s to fabricate the extremely long strings and wide pieces of textiles typical of the area. According to his theory, the figurative patterns (smaller and less common) were meant only for ritualistic purposes. This theory is not widely accepted, although scholars have noted similarities in patterns between the textiles and the Nazca Lines. They interpret these similarities as arising from the common culture.

The first systematic field study of the geoglyphs was made by Markus Reindel and Johny Cuadrado Island. Since 1996, they have documented and excavated more than 650 sites.  They compared the iconography of the lines to  ceramics of the cultures. As archeologists, they believe that the figurative motifs of geoglyphs can be dated to having been made between 200 and 600 BC.&lt;ref&gt;Reindel and Wagner, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Based on the results of geophysical investigations and the observation of geological faults, Johnson argued that some geoglyphs followed the paths of aquifersm from which aqueducts (or ''[[puquios]]'') collected water.&lt;ref&gt; Johnson et al. 2002 &lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nicola Masini]] and [[Giuseppe Orefici]] have conducted research in Pampa de Atarco (at about 10 km south of Pampa de Nasca), which they believe reveals a spatial, functional and religious relationship between these geoglyphs and the temples of [[Cahuachi]].&lt;ref&gt; Masini et al. 2016&lt;/ref&gt;  In particular, they investigated using  remote sensing techniques and found "five groups of geoglyphs, each of them characterized by a specific motif and shape, and associated with a distinct function".&lt;ref&gt; Masini et al. 2016, p. 239&lt;/ref&gt; They identified a ceremonial one, characterized by meandering motifs. Another is related to calendrical purpose, as proved by the presence of radial centers aligned along the directions of winter solstice and equinox sunset.  As have earlier scholars, the two Italians believe that the geoglyphs were the venues of events linked to the agriculture calendar. These also served to strengthen social cohesion among various groups of pilgrims, sharing common ancestors and religious beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;Masini et al. 2016, p. 277&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alternative explanations==
[[file:NEO nazca lines big.jpg|right|thumb|Satellite picture of an area containing lines: north is to the right (coordinates: {{coord|14|43|S|75|08|W|}})]]&lt;!-- note image is rotated approx. 90° cw, with north at right --&gt;
Other theories were that the geometric lines could indicate water flow or irrigation schemes, or be a part of rituals to "summon" water. The spiders, birds, and plants may be fertility symbols. It also has been theorized that the lines could act as an [[astronomical calendar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Brown|first=Cynthia Stokes|title=Big History|publisher=The New Press|location=New York|date=2007|page=167|isbn=978-1-59558-196-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Phyllis Pitluga, senior astronomer at the [[Adler Planetarium]] and a protégé of Reiche, performed computer-aided studies of star alignments. She asserted the giant spider figure is an [[Anamorphosis|anamorphic]] diagram of the [[Orion (constellation)|constellation Orion]]. She further suggested that three of the straight lines leading to the figure were used to track the changing [[declinations]] of the three stars of [[Orion's Belt]]. In a critique of her analysis, Dr. Anthony F. Aveni noted she did not account for the other 12 lines of the figure. 

He commented generally on her conclusions, saying:
&lt;blockquote&gt;I really had trouble finding good evidence to back up what she contended. Pitluga never laid out the criteria for selecting the lines she chose to measure, nor did she pay much attention to the archaeological data Clarkson and Silverman had unearthed. Her case did little justice to other information about the coastal cultures, save applying, with subtle contortions, Urton's representations of constellations from the highlands. As historian [[Jacquetta Hawkes]] might ask: was she getting the pampa she desired?&lt;ref&gt;Aveni, Anthony F. ''Between the Lines: The Mystery of the Giant Ground Drawings of Ancient Nasca, Peru ''. Austin, Texas: University of Texas Press. 1 July 2006 {{ISBN|0-292-70496-8}} p.205 [https://books.google.com/books?id=J5mEfUJgno0C&amp;pg=PA204&amp;dq=pitluga+nazca+lines&amp;ei=zpVES4LGEJ-SygTgp53oBw&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Jim Woodmann&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sites.google.com/site/scienceinthesand/the-theory-of-jim-woodman|title=The Theory of Jim Woodman - Science in the Sand|publisher=|accessdate=17 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; theorized that the Nazca lines could not have been made without some form of flight to observe the figures properly. Based on his study of available technology, he suggests a [[hot-air balloon]] was the only possible means of flight at the time of construction. To test this hypothesis, Woodmann made a hot-air balloon using materials and techniques he understood to have been available to the Nazca people. The balloon flew, after a fashion. Most scholars have rejected Woodmann's thesis as ''[[ad hoc hypothesis|ad hoc]]'',&lt;ref name="reece"&gt;Katherine Reece, [http://www.hallofmaat.com/modules.php?name=Articles&amp;file=article&amp;sid=96 "Grounding the Nasca Balloon"], ''Into the Hall of Ma'at'' website&lt;/ref&gt; because of the lack of any evidence of such balloons.&lt;ref&gt;Haughton (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Preservation and environmental concerns==
People trying to preserve the Nazca Lines are concerned about threats of [[pollution]] and [[erosion]] caused by [[deforestation]] in the region.

{{quote|The Lines themselves are superficial, they are only 10 to 30&amp;nbsp;cm deep and could be washed away... Nazca has only ever received a small amount of rain. But now there are great changes to the weather all over the world.

After flooding and mudslides in the area in mid-February 2007, Mario Olaechea Aquije, archaeological resident from Peru's [[National Institute of Culture]], and a team of specialists surveyed the area. He said, "[T]he mudslides and heavy rains did not appear to have caused any significant damage to the Nazca Lines". He noted that the nearby Southern [[Pan-American Highway]] did suffer damage, and "the damage done to the roads should serve as a reminder to just how fragile these figures are."&lt;ref&gt;Living in Peru.

In 2012, squatters occupied land in the area, damaging a Nazca-era cemetery and allowing their pigs to have access to some of the land.

In 2013, machinery used in a limestone quarry was reported to have destroyed a small section of a line, and caused damage to another.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Manuel Vigo |url=http://www.peruthisweek.com/news-3743-peru-heavy-machinery-destroys-nazca-lines/ |title=Peru: Heavy machinery destroys Nazca lines |publisher=Peru this Week |date=2013-03-14 |accessdate=2013-07-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130729023312/http://www.peruthisweek.com/news-3743-peru-heavy-machinery-destroys-nazca-lines |archivedate=2013-07-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2014, [[Greenpeace]] activists irreparably damaged the Nazca Lines while setting up a banner within the lines of one of the famed geoglyphs. The activists damaged an area around the hummingbird by grinding rocks into the sandy soil. Access to the area around the lines is strictly prohibited&lt;ref name="WSJ Nazca"&gt;{{cite news|last=Kozak|first=Robert|date=2014-12-14|title=Peru Says Greenpeace Permanently Damaged Nazca Lines|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/peru-says-greenpeace-permanently-damaged-nazca-lines-1418681478|newspaper=The Wall Street Journal|access-date=2015-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nyt nazca"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Neuman|first1=William|title=Peru is Indignant After Greenpeace Makes Its Mark on Ancient Site|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/13/world/americas/peru-is-indignant-after-greenpeace-makes-its-mark-on-ancient-site.html|accessdate=13 December 2014|publisher=The New York Times|date=12 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and special shoes must be worn to avoid damaging the [[UN World Heritage]] site.

"The damage done is irreparable and the apologies offered by the environmental group aren't enough," she said at a news conference.&lt;ref name="WSJ Nazca"/&gt; Facing increasing pressure, Greenpeace later released the identities of four of the activists involved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jan/20/greenpeace-lima-nazca-lines-protest-suspects | title=Greenpeace identifies four suspects linked to protest at famed Nazca Lines site | date=January 21, 2015 | accessdate=November 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the activists, Wolfgang Sadik, was eventually fined and given a suspended prison sentence for his role in the incident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://santiagotimes.cl/2017/05/20/greenpeace-activist-fined-sentenced-for-damaging-nazca-lines-in-peru/ | title=Greenpeace activist fined, sentenced for damaging Nazca Lines in Peru | date=May 20, 2017 | accessdate=November 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Greenpeace incident also directed attention to other damage to geoglyphs outside of the World Heritage area caused in 2012 and 2013 by off-road vehicles of the [[Dakar Rally]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Dube |first1=Ryan |last2=Kozak |first2=Robert |date=December 28, 2014 |title=Peruvians Spar Over Protecting Ancient Sites |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/peruvians-spar-over-protecting-ancient-sites-1419813859 |work=[[Wall Street Journal]] |subscription=yes |accessdate=July 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is visible from satellite imagery.&lt;ref&gt;Hesse R. "Combining Structure-from-Motion with high and intermediate resolution satellite images to document threats to archaeological heritage in arid environments". ''Journal of Cultural Heritage'' 16 (2015), pp. 192–201&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2018, an errant truck driver was arrested, but later released for lack of evidence indicating any intent other than simple error. He had damaged three of the geoglyphs by leaving substantial tire marks across an area of approximately 150 by 350 feet (46 m by 107 m).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2018/02/01/a-truck-driver-inexplicably-plowed-over-a-2000-year-old-historical-site-in-peru-damaging-the-designs/ |title= A truck driver inexplicably plowed over a 2,000-year-old site in Peru, damaging the designs |date= Feb 1, 2018 |publisher= Washington Post |first= Eli |last= Rosenberg }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Revision''' is the stage in the [[writing process]] where the [[author]] reviews, alters, and amends their message, according to what has been written in the [[Draft document|draft]]. Revision follows drafting and precedes [[editing]]. Drafting and revising often form a loop as a work moves back and forth between the two stages. It is not uncommon for professional writers to go through many drafts and revisions before successfully creating a written piece that is ready for the next stage: editing. Revision itself is not indicative of the quality of the text.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Revision Cognitive and Instructional Processes: Cognitive and Instructional Processes|last=Allal|first=Linda|last2=Chanquoy|first2=L.|last3=Largy|first3=Pierre|publisher=Springer Science and Business Media LLC|year=2004|isbn=9789401037761|location=New York|pages=190}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In their seminal book, ''[[The Elements of Style]]'', [[William Strunk, Jr.]] and [[E.B. White]] acknowledge the need for revision in the writing process: “Few writers are so expert that they can produce what they are after on the first try. Quite often you will discover, on examining the completed work, that there are serious flaws in the arrangement of the material, calling for [[:wikt:transpose|transposition]]s... do not be afraid to experiment with your text.”

For an essay, a successful revision involves:

'''Identification of thesis'''. The purpose of the essay should be re-considered based on what has been written in the draft. If this purpose differs from the original [[thesis]], the author must decide from which thesis to continue writing.

'''Consideration of structure'''. The author should identify the strengths of the draft, then re-consider the order of those strengths, adjusting their placement as necessary so the work can build with [[Auxesis (figure of speech)|auxesis]] to a [[crescendo]].

'''Uncovering weakness in argument or presentation'''. Once the strengths of the draft have been identified and placed in the strongest order, the author can re-examine the work for weaknesses in argument or presentation. Faulty [[logic]], missing [[Transition words|transitions]], and unsupported  or poorly supported assertions are common weaknesses. Identifying these weaknesses during revision will inform the next draft.

In general, revision of written work can be guided by the following questions:

* Is the writing clear? Does it make sense?
* Is there enough information to describe ideas?
* Is there too much information so that the writing wanders off topic?
* Are the ideas or the narrative flow in a logical order?&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Beginning Writing Lab|last=Atlee|first=Nancy|publisher=Prufrock Press Inc.|year=1998|isbn=1883055296|location=San Luis, CA|pages=44}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Successful revision is not improving [[grammar]] or [[diction]]. Those will be the focus of later editing. However, there are instances when the writer or the author employs a strategy that involves a reviewing process. There are scholarship and theories citing this particular theme such as the case of the three-component model identified by Hayes and Flower&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Effective Learning and Teaching of Writing: A Handbook of Writing in Education|last=Rijlaarsdam|first=|last2=Bergh|first2=Huub|last3=Couzijn|first3=Michel|publisher=Kluwer Academic Publishers|year=2007|isbn=1402027249|location=New York|pages=105}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the James Britton's model of the writing process as a series of stages described in metaphors of linear growth, conception - incubation - production.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Landmark Essays on Writing Process|last=Perl|first=Sondra|publisher=Hermagoras Press|year=1994|isbn=1880393131|location=Davis, CA|pages=75}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Here, a review by the writer or a third party, which often entails corrective annotations, is part of the process that leads to the revision stage. Recently, due to the collaborative capabilities offered by the [[Internet]], there are writers who "[[Crowdsourcing|crowdsource]]" reviews from several people, who contribute digital annotations.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The '''Royal College of Speech and Language Therapists''' (abbreviated as the '''RCSLT''') is the professional body for [[Speech pathology|speech and language therapists]] in the [[United Kingdom]]. It was established on 6 January 1945 as the College of Speech Therapists, through the amalgamation of the Association of Speech Therapists and the British Society of Speech Therapists in 1944. 

It became the Royal College of Speech and Language Therapist after receiving its [[royal charter]] in 1995. [[HRH The Countess of Wessex]] is the colleges current patron. The majority of members are [[Speech pathology|speech therapists]].

==History==
The College of Speech Therapists was created following the amalgamation of the Association of Speech Therapists and the British Society of Speech Therapists in 1944.&lt;ref name=RCSLT1'&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.rcslt.org/about/introduction |title=Introducing to the RCSLT |publisher=Royal College of Speech and Language Therapy |accessdate=4 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was first patronised in 1948 by [[King George VI]], who received speech and language therapy for his stammer. Her Majesty [[Queen Elizabeth, the Queen Mother]], continued this support after his death in 1952 and become the college's patron in 1959.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Queen Elizabeth: The Queen Mother: the Official Biography |author1=Shawcross, W. |date=2009 |publisher=Pan Macmillan |page=953}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The college was awarded the right to call itself the '[[Royal College]]' of Speech and Language Therapists in 1995. [[HRH The Countess of Wessex]] became the current RCSLT patron in 2003 after the death of the Queen Mother in 2002.&lt;ref name=RCSLT1' /&gt;

==Work==
The RCSLT is a professional membership body which promotes for the public benefit the art and science of speech and language therapy, meaning the care for individuals with communication, swallowing, eating and drinking difficulties.&lt;ref name='CC'&gt;{{cite web |url=http://beta.charitycommission.gov.uk/charity-details/?regid=273724&amp;subid=0 |title=Royal College Of Speech And Language Therapists: Data for financial year ending 31 March 2017 |publisher=[[Charity Commission for England and Wales]] |accessdate=7 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Its stated professional aims are: to provide leadership and setting professional standards for speech therapists in the UK; to facilitate and promote research into the field of speech and language therapy; to promote better education and training of speech and language therapists; to provide information for members and the public about speech and language therapy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.rcslt.org/about/introduction |title=Introducing the RCSLT |date=2018 |publisher=Royal College of Speech and Language Therapists |accessdate=7 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Finances===
In the financial year 2016&amp;nbsp;2017 it had an income of over £4.2&amp;nbsp;million and an expenditure of over £4.3&amp;nbsp;million,&lt;ref name='CC' /&gt; of which £3.3&amp;nbsp;million (79%) derived from membership income.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://apps.charitycommission.gov.uk/Accounts/Ends24/0000273724_AC_20170331_E_C.PDF |title=ROYAL COLLEGE OF SPEECH AND LANGUAGE THERAPISTS TRUSTEES REPORT FOR THE YEAR ENDING 31 MARCH 2017 |publisher=Royal College of Speech and Language Therapists |accessdate=7 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Membership==
The total membership in 2018 was 17,468. Of this figure, 14,267 were UK practising members, 949 were UK non-practising members, 493 were retired, 373 were overseas, 1,197 were students, and 189 were associates. The total membership has risen progressively: there were 15,883 members in 2014, 16,194 in 2015, 16,681 in 2016, 17,083 in 2017 and 17,468 in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Dorward, M. |author2=Ghadok, K. |date= September 2018 |title=The RCSLT IMPACT REPORT 2017-2018: Message from the RCSLT Chair and CEO |journal=Bulletin: the official magazine of the royal college of speech and language therapists |volume=797 |pages=2-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2018 survey of its membership (of which 2,700 responded), the RCSLT found that the mean age of its members was 42 and that 73% were employed by the NHS; the remainder worked in independent practice (11%), schools (3%), local authorities (3%), universities (3%), or in other areas (7%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Dorward, M. |author2=Money, D. |date= September 2018 |title=Members first |journal=Bulletin: the official magazine of the royal college of speech and language therapists |volume=797 |pages=20-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A. Mangan, Fan Hong|isbn=978-0-7146-8330-0|year= 2002|publisher=Frank Cass Publishers}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sepak takraw differs from the similar sport of [[footvolley]] in its use of a [[rattan]] ball and only allowing players to use their feet, knee, chest and head to touch the ball.

In [[Indonesia]], and [[Singapore]], it is called ''sepak takraw''. In [[Malaysia]], it is called as ''sepak raga.'' In [[Thailand]], it is called as ''takraw'' only. In [[Laos]], it is ''kataw'' ({{lang-lo|"twine" and "kick"}}).&lt;ref name=kelley /&gt; In the [[Philippines]], besides the borrowed term "takraw", it is also known by its native name ''sipa'', meaning "kick". In [[Myanmar]], it is known as [[Chinlone|''chin lone'']], and is considered more of an art as there is often no opposing team, and the point is to keep the ball aloft gracefully and interestingly. 

Similar games include [[footbag net]], [[footvolley]], [[football tennis]], [[bossaball]], [[jianzi]], [[jokgu]] and [[sipa]].

==Etymology==
"Sepak" is the [[Malay language|Malay]] word for kick and "takraw" is the [[Thai language|Thai]] word for a woven [[rattan]] ball; therefore sepak takraw quite literally means "to kick a ball".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/us/sepak_takraw|title=sepak takraw {{!}} Definition of sepak takraw in US English by Oxford Dictionaries|website=Oxford Dictionaries {{!}} English|access-date=2018-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sepak takraw is known in many names across Southeast Asia; including {{lang-id|sepak takraw}}; {{lang-ms|sepak raga}}; {{lang-th|ตะกร้อ}}, {{RTGS|''takro''}}, {{IPA-th|tā.krɔ̂ː|pron}}; {{lang-my|ပိုက္ေက်ာ္ျခင္း}}, ''Pike Kyaw Chin''; {{lang-fil|sipà, sipà tákraw, sepák tákraw}}, {{IPA-tl|sɛ̝päk täkɾɐw|pron}}; {{lang-km|សីដក់}}, ''Sei Dak''; {{lang-lo|ກະຕໍ້}}, ''ka-taw''; {{lang-vi|cầu mây}}, "calameae ball" or "rattan ball".

==History==
The earliest historical evidence shows the game was played in the 15th century's [[Malacca Sultanate]], for it is mentioned in the Malay historical text, "[[Sejarah Melayu]]" (Malay Annals).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  | last = Dunsmore  | first =  Susi  | title = Sepak Raga  | publisher = [[University of Michigan]]  | year = 1983  | page = 2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Malay Annals]] described in details the incident of [[Muhammad Shah of Pahang|Raja Muhammad]], a son of [[Mansur Shah|Sultan Mansur Shah]] who was accidentally hit with a rattan ball by Tun Besar, a son of [[Tun Perak]], in a Sepak raga game. The ball hit Raja Muhammad's headgear and knocked it down to the ground. In anger, Raja Muhammad immediately stabbed and killed Tun Besar, whereupon some of Tun Besar's kinsmen retaliated and wanted to kill Raja Muhammad. However, [[Tun Perak]] managed to restrain them from such an act of treason by saying that he would no longer accept Raja Muhammad as the Sultan's heir. As a result of this incident, [[Mansur Shah|Sultan Mansur Shah]] ordered his son out of [[Malacca]] and had him installed as the ruler of [[Pahang Sultanate|Pahang]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  | last = Brown  | first = Charles Cuthbert  | authorlink = David Mumford  | title = Sejarah Melayu; or, Malay annals: an annotated translation [from the Malay]  | publisher = [[Oxford University Press]]  | year = 1970  | page = 89}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Indonesia]], sepak takraw was spread from nearby Malacca across the strait to [[Riau islands]] and [[Riau]] area in Sumatra as early as the 16th century, where it is also called as ''Sepak Raga'' in local Malay tongue,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://melayuonline.com/ind/culture/dig/1302 |title=Permainan Sepak Raga |publisher=Melayuonline.com |date= |accessdate=25 March 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140325191325/http://melayuonline.com/ind/culture/dig/1302 |archive-date=25 March 2014 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://id.voi.co.id/fitur/voi-pesona-indonesia/4125-sepak-raga-permainan-tradisional-masyarakat-di-propinsi-kepulauan-riau.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101107190942/http://id.voi.co.id/fitur/voi-pesona-indonesia/4125-sepak-raga-permainan-tradisional-masyarakat-di-propinsi-kepulauan-riau.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=7 November 2010 |title=Sepak Raga, Permainan Tradisional Masyarakat Di Propinsi Kepulauan Riau |publisher=Id.voi.co.id |date= |accessdate=25 March 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; at that time some of Sumatran areas were part of Malacca sultanate. From there the Malay people spread across archipelago and introduced the game to [[Bugis|Buginese people]] in Sulawesi. Then the game is developed as Buginese traditional game which is called "Raga" (the players are called "Pa'Raga"). The "Raga" can trace its origin from [[Malacca Sultanate]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://melayuonline.com/ind/culture/dig/1224/permainan-marraga-akraga|title=Permainan Marraga/Akraga (Bugis)|publisher=Melayuonline|accessdate=4 August 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100412070015/http://melayuonline.com/ind/culture/dig/1224/permainan-marraga-akraga|archive-date=12 April 2010|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was popular in South Sulawesi since the 19th century. Some men playing "Raga" encircling within a group, the ball is passed from one to another and the man who kicked the ball highest is the winner. "Raga" is also played for fun by demonstrating some tricks, such as kicking the ball and putting it on top of player's head holds by ''tengkolok bugis'' (Bugis cloth headgear similar to Malay ''tanjak'').

[[File:Sepak Takraw game.webm|thumb|Video recording of a Sepak Takraw game]]

In Thailand (formerly Siam), there was evidence that the Thai had played Sepak Takraw since the [[Ayutthaya Kingdom]], at least during the reign of King [[Naresuan]] (1590–1605).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The History of Takraw in Thailand|publisher=Sepaktakrawworld.com|url=http://www.sepaktakrawworld.com/index.php/-tournament-/13-vigo-cup}}&lt;/ref&gt; A French historian, [[François Henri Turpin]], wrote about how the Siamese played the game of takraw to stay in shape.&lt;ref&gt;ibid.&lt;/ref&gt;  Murals at [[Bangkok]]'s [[Wat Phra Kaeo]] which was built in 1785, depict the [[Hinduism|Hindu]] god [[Hanuman]] playing sepak takraw in a ring with a troop of [[monkey]]s. The game was played in its circle form for hundreds of years, and the modern version of ''sepak takraw'' began taking shape in Thailand sometime during the early 1740s. In 1929 the Siam Sports Association drafted the first rules for takraw competition. &lt;ref&gt;ibid.&lt;/ref&gt; Four years later, the association introduced the volleyball-style net and held the first public contest. Within just a few years, takraw was introduced to the curriculum in Siamese schools. The game became such a cherished local custom that another exhibition of volleyball-style takraw was staged to celebrate the kingdom's first constitution in 1933, the year after Thailand abolished [[absolute monarchy]].

In the Philippines the sport was called "[[sipa]]" and along with traditional [[Filipino martial arts|martial arts]] survived the three century Spanish colonisation. It is a popular sport played by children in Philippines. It was the Philippine national sport until it was replaced by [[arnis]] in 2009. Sepak Takraw is included in Philippine's elementary and highschool curriculum. In [[Myanmar]], or Burma, it was dubbed "[[chinlone]]", in [[Laos]] "kator", "cầu mây" in Vietnam and in Indonesia "raga" or "sepak takraw".&lt;ref name="kelley" /&gt;

Some believed that many variations of the game evolved from [[cuju]], an ancient Chinese military exercise, where soldiers would try to keep a feathered shuttlecock airborne by kicking it back and forth between two people. As the sport developed, the animal hide and chicken feathers were eventually replaced by balls made of woven strips of rattan.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

The first versions of sepak takraw were not so much of a competition, but rather cooperative displays of skill designed to exercise the body, improve dexterity and loosen the limbs after long periods of sitting, standing or working.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

By the 1940s, the net version of the game had spread throughout Southeast Asia, and formal rules were introduced. This sport became officially known as "sepak takraw".

==Competition==
[[File:2014 Asian Games 3.jpg|thumb|upright|Player making a service at the 2014 Asian Games]]
International play is now governed by [[International Sepaktakraw Federation|ISTAF]], the International Sepak Takraw Federation.  Major competitions for the sport such as the [[ISTAF SuperSeries]], the [[ISTAF World Cup]] and the [[King's Cup World Championships]] are held every year.

Sepak takraw is now a regular sport event in the [[Asian Games]] and the [[Southeast Asian Games]].

===Asian Games===
{{main article|Sepak takraw at the Asian Games}}
Sepak takraw has been a sport at the Asian Games since [[Sepak takraw at the 1990 Asian Games|1990]] with Thailand securing the highest number of gold medals.

===Canada===
The Lao people first brought sepak takraw into Canada when they immigrated as refugees in the 1970s. But the game got exposure outside the Laotian communities and really started taking off when a Saskatchewan teacher, Richard (Rick) Engel, who encountered sepak takraw while living in Asia, included it in Asian Sport, Education &amp; Culture (ASEC) International's School Presentation Program. Sepak takraw was so well received by schools that it became part of ASEC's mandate to help introduce, promote and organise the sport right across the country. In May 1998, after getting many schools playing sepak takraw, and by networking with experienced players, ASEC International organised the first Canadian inter-provincial tournament to include men's, boys and girls teams. By the end of 1998, Engel was sent to Bangkok, Thailand to film at the 14th King's Cup Sepak Takraw World Championships – the footage of which was used to produce a widely used instructional sepak takraw video/DVD, called ''Sepak Takraw – Just for Kicks''.

On 11 December 1998, the Sepak Takraw Association of Canada (STAC)&lt;ref&gt;[http://takrawcanada.com/?q=node/32 Sepak Takraw Association of Canada (STAC)]&lt;/ref&gt; was incorporated to organise and govern the sport nationally. Its office was set up in Regina, SK, where there are experienced players and organisational support, and where it could share the resources and office space of the already established ASEC International, a committee from which has now become Sepak Takraw Saskatchewan Inc.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sepaktakrawsask.com/ Sepak Takraw Saskatchewan Inc.]&lt;/ref&gt; The first annual Canadian Open Sepak Takraw Championships (a national and international tournament event) were held in May 1999 in Regina, SK, and have over the years attracted teams from across Canada, the United States, Japan, Malaysia and China. That same year Canada also attended its first International Sepak Takraw Federation (ISTAF) Congress and was accepted as members of ISTAF, which governs the sport globally. In 2000, Rick Engel, Perry Senko and Brydon Blacklaws played for Team Canada and earned a silver medal in the entry level division of the King's Cup World Sepak Takraw Championships in Thailand. Another major milestone was achieved on 3 December 2000, when STAC and the sport of sepak takraw became an official class E Member of the Canadian Olympic Committee.

Canada has since contributed much to the development of sepak takraw worldwide, with Engel authoring three instructional sepak takraw books&lt;ref&gt;[http://takrawcanada.com/?q=node/15#block-block-3]&lt;/ref&gt; and helping produce five sepak takraw DVDs, while STAC does the publishing. The most notable of these books is ''Sepak Takraw 101 - The Complete Coaching/Instructional Manual for Sepak Takraw (Kick Volleyball)'', the third edition of which has also been translated and published in the Indonesian language and released in Indonesia through a government education project. Engel has found himself to be in demand, introducing the sport and conducting sepak takraw skills clinics in schools and sessions at physical education teachers' conferences all over Canada, the US and Europe.

===Japan===
A Japanese team played at the [[1990 Asian Games]] in Beijing. While as of 2010 there are no professional teams in Japan, university level teams had been established at [[Asia University (Japan)|Asia University]], [[Chiba University]], [[Keio University]], and [[Waseda University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://metropolis.co.jp/arts/sport/sepak-takraw/|title=Sepak Takraw: By veronica lodge|date=4 February 2010|publisher=''[[Metropolis (free magazine)|Metropolis Magazine]]''|accessdate=4 February 2010|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110115065439/http://metropolis.co.jp/arts/sport/sepak-takraw/|archivedate=15 January 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
The earliest accounts of organized takraw in the United States involve a group of students from  [[Northrop University]] (Greg St. Pierre, Thomas Gong, Joel "big bird" Nelson, and Mark Kimitsuka) in 1986 in Inglewood, California, learning about and playing the sport in Los Angeles. In the early 80s, Southeast Asians held soccer tournaments that had takraw events in Wisconsin, Michigan, Minnesota and California, especially within the Lao, Hmong and Thai communities.&lt;ref&gt;The Log, Northrop University Student Newspaper, 5 November 1987, Vol 35, No. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; Malaysian students attending the University often enjoyed playing the sport on a court on top of the dormitory cafeteria. They taught a handful of curious American students how to play, which in turn inspired [[Malaysia Airlines]] to sponsor a US team from the university to attend the National Tournament in Kuala Lumpur in November 1987. The Northrop team played in a bracket of international new teams with Korea, Sri Lanka, and Australia. The US team beat Sri Lanka and Australia to bring home the gold.&lt;ref&gt;Northrop University Magazine, December 1987, Vol 3, No. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

Takraw really began to take off, however, in the late 1980s when Kurt Sonderegger, an American working in Switzerland, met a fellow American who showed him a bouncy ball made of woven strips of rattan. The traveller told Sonderegger that the ball was from Thailand and gave him the ball as a gift. Sonderegger was a soccer fan, and takraw had an immediate appeal to him. On a whim, Sonderegger booked a trip to Thailand to find out more. While in Thailand, Sonderegger discovered the actual sport of sepak takraw and was hooked.

Los Angeles's Asian community and Northrop's team had already established a takraw community in and around L.A. Sonderegger moved to Los Angeles, founded the United States Takraw Association, and started a business that sold plastic takraw balls. In 1989, he was sent an invitation from the International Sepak Takraw Federation, and Sonderegger along with a few of the Northrop group travelled to represent the United States in the World Championships.

The team was beaten badly but the takraw world was enchanted with the fact that non-Asian teams had competed at the World Championships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1005482/index.htm | work=CNN | title=Video | date=8 August 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rules and regulations==
Measurements of courts and equipment often vary among tournaments and organisations that operate from a recreational to a competitive level; ''international competitive rules and regulations are used in this section.'' There are two types of event categories: the regu and the doubles regu. The regu category is played by three players on each team while the doubles regu is played by two players on each team.

===Expressions===
''Takraw'' is the Thai word for the hand-woven rattan ball originally used in the game. Therefore, the game is essentially "kick ball".&lt;ref&gt;Talking Takraw[Electronic Version]. ''Journal of Mens Fitness,'' Vol. 20, Issue 10.&lt;/ref&gt;  The concept of Footvolley originates from Thai Takraw pronounced (Tha-Graw)  Also, sometimes misnamed by foreigners as "Shaolin Soccer" however it is an ancient game mainly enjoyed between Thai and Laos.

===Court===
[[File:Sepak Takraw court diagram.svg|thumb|250px|Sepak takraw court diagram]]
The sepak takraw sport is played on a similar to [[badminton]] double sized court.&lt;ref name="sportsmatchmaker.com"&gt;Sportsmatchmaker. (2005). ''Sepak Takraw.''Retrieved 23 March 2009, from the sportsmatchmaker website: http://www.sportsmatchmaker.com/rules/s-sports/sepak_takraw.cfm&lt;/ref&gt;

Area of {{convert|13.4|x|6.1|m}} free from all obstacles up to the height of {{convert|8|m}} measured from the floor surface (sand and grass court not advisable). The width of the lines bounding the court should not be more than {{convert|4|cm}} measured and drawn inwards from the edge of the court measurements. All the boundary lines should be drawn at least {{convert|3.0|m}} away from all obstacles.
The centre line of {{convert|2|cm|abbr=on}} should be drawn equally dividing the right and left court.

At the corner of each at the center line, the quarter circle shall be drawn from the sideline to the center line with a radius of {{convert|0.9|m}} measured and drawn outwards from the edge of the 0.9 m radius.

The service circle of 0.3 m radius shall be drawn on the left and on the right court, the center of which is 2.45 m from the back line of the court and 3.05 m from the sidelines, the 0.04 m line shall be measured and drawn outward from the edge of the 0.3 m radius.&lt;ref name=istaf&gt;{{cite web

===Net===
The net shall be made of fine ordinary cord or nylon with 6&amp;nbsp;cm to 8&amp;nbsp;cm mesh. Similar to a volleyball net.&lt;ref name="sportsmatchmaker.com"&gt;Sportsmatchmaker. (2005). ''Sepak Takraw.''Retrieved 23 March 2009, from the sportsmatchmaker website: http://www.sportsmatchmaker.com/rules/s-sports/sepak_takraw.cfm&lt;/ref&gt;

The net shall be 0.7 m in width and not shorter than 6.10 m in length and taped at 0.05 m from tape double at the top and sideline, called boundary tape.

The net shall be edged with 0.05 m tape double at the top and the bottom of the net supported by a fine ordinary cord or nylon cord that runs through the tape and strain over and flush with the top of the posts. The top of the net shall be 1.52 m (1.42 m for women) in height from the center and 1.55 m (1.45 m for women) at the posts.&lt;ref name=istaf&gt;{{cite web

===Ball===
[[File:Rattan sepak tawraw ball.png|thumb|A sepak takraw ball made out of [[rattan]]]]
The sepak takraw ball shall be spherical, made of synthetic fibre or one woven layer.

Sepak takraw balls without [[synthetic rubber]] covering must have 12 holes and 20 intersections, must have a circumference measuring not less from {{convert|42|to(-)|44|cm|abbr=on|1}} for men and from {{convert|43|to(-)|45|cm|abbr=on|1}} for women, and must have a weight that ranges from {{convert|170|to(-)|180|g|abbr=on}} for men and from {{convert|150|to(-)|160|g|abbr=on}} for women.

The ball can be in plain single colour, multi-colour, and luminous colours, but not in any colour that will impair the performance of the players.

The sepak takraw ball can also be constructed of synthetic rubber or soft durable material for covering the ball, for the purpose of softening the impact of the ball on the player's body. The type of material and method used for constructing the ball or for covering the ball with rubber or soft durable covering must be approved by ISTAF before it can be used for any competition.

All world, international, and regional competitions sanctioned by [[International Sepak Takraw Federation]], including but not limited to, the [[Olympic Games]], [[World Games]], [[Commonwealth Games]], [[Asian Games]] and [[SEA Games]], must be played with ISTAF approved sepak takraw balls.&lt;ref name="istaf" /&gt;

===Players===
A match is played by two teams called 'regu', each consisting of three players. On some occasions, it can be played by only two players (doubles) or four players (quadrant) per team.

One of the players shall be at the back; he/she is called a "Tekong". The other two players shall be in front, one on the left and the other on the right. The player on the left is called a "feeder/setter/tosser" and the player on the right is called a "attacker/striker/killer".&lt;ref name="istaf" /&gt;

===Start of play and service===
The side that must serve first shall start the first set. The side that wins the first set shall have the options of "Choosing Service".

The throw must be executed as soon as the referee calls the score. If either of the "Inside" players throws the ball before the referee calls the score, it must be re-thrown and a warning will be given to the thrower.

During the service, as soon as the Tekong kicks the ball, all the players are allowed to move about freely in their respective courts.

The service is valid if the ball passes over the net, whether it touches the net or not, and inside the boundary of the two net tapes and boundary lines of the opponent's court.&lt;ref name="istaf" /&gt;

===Faults in the game===

====Serving side during service====
* The "Inside" player who is making service throws, plays with the(throwing up the ball, bumping, giving to other "Inside" player etc.) after the call of score has been made by the referee.
* The "Inside" player lifts his feet or steps on the line or crosses over or touches the net while throwing the ball.
* The Tekong jumps off the ground to execute the service.
* The Tekong does not kick the ball on the service throw.
* The ball touches his own player before crossing over the opponent court.
* The ball goes over the net but falls outside the court.
* The ball does not cross to the opponent side.
* A player uses his hand or hands, or any other part of his arms to facilitate the execution of a kick even if the hand or arm does not directly touch the ball, but it touches other objects or surfaces instead when doing so.

====Serving and receiving side during service====
* Creating distracting manner or noise or shouting at his opponent.

====For both sides during the game====
* Any player who touches the ball on the opponent side.
* Any part of player's body crosses over into opponent's court whether above or under the net except during the follow-through of the ball.
* Playing the ball more than 3 times in succession.
* The ball touches the arm
* Stopping or holding the ball under the arm, between the legs or body.
* Any part of the body or player's outfits e.g. shoes, jersey, head band etc., touches the net or the post or the referee's chairs or falls into the opponent's side.
* The ball touches the ceiling, roof or the wall (any objects).

===Scoring system===
An official doubles or regu match is won by best of three sets (win 2 out of 3 sets), with each set being played up to 21 points.

A team event or group match is effectively three regu matches played back to back, using different players for each regu. The winner is determined by best of three regus (win 2 out of 3 regus), where a winner of each individual regu is determined by best of 3 sets, played up to 21 points per set.

In the last 3rd set the change of sides takes place when one team reaches 11 points.

Point: when either serving side or receiving side commits a fault, a point is awarded to the opponent side.

==Competing countries==
International play is now governed by ISTAF, the International Sepak Takraw Federation
Serving: Teams alternate serve every three points, regardless of who wins the points. I.e., each team serves three times, then the other team serves three times, and so on. If a tie takes place at 21-21, each team alternates one serve each until a winner is determined.

Set: each set is won by the side which scores 21 points with a minimum lead of two points to a ceiling of 25 points. In the event of a 21-21 tie, the set shall be won by the side which gets a lead of two points, or when a side reaches 25 points (whichever occurs first).

Match: a match is won by the team who has won two sets. A team event match is won by the team that wins two regus.

Ranking: in group stages of tournaments or team events (round robin) the ranking in a group is determined by:
1. Sum of match wins; a match win gives 1 point
2. Sum set points
3. Point difference +/-

This article describes the '''[[phonology]]''' of the '''[[Somali language]]'''.

==Consonants==
Common Somali has 23 consonant [[phoneme]]s. Its consonants cover every place of articulation on the [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]] chart, though not all of these distinctions are phonemic.

The voiced affricate /dʒ/ is missing in many northern and eastern dialects, with the voiceless affricate /tʃ/ taking its place. 

{{IPA|/ɖ/}} is a [[voiced retroflex stop]]. Some phoneticians say that it has an [[implosive consonant|implosive]] quality for some speakers. It is sometimes realised as a flap {{IPA|[ɾ]}} between vowels.

The voiceless stops {{IPA|/t/}} and {{IPA|/k/}} are always aspirated.

{{IPA|/ʕ/}}, the [[voiced pharyngeal fricative]], may have creaky voice.

{{IPA|/r/}} is often pronounced with breathy voice and may be partially devoiced. Between vowels it may be a single tap.

/q/ can, in some dialects, be pronounced as a /x/.

==Vowels==
[[File:Somali vowel chart.svg|thumb|upright=1.13|[[Monophthong]]s of Somali on a vowel chart, from {{Harvcoltxt|Saeed|1993}}]]
Somali has five vowel articulations that all contrast [[murmured voice|murmured]] and [[harsh voice]]&lt;!--with modal voice or with one another?--&gt; as well as [[vowel length]].{{Clarify|date=April 2012}}&lt;!--see talk for ref to check actual number of resulting vowels. (Are all the harsh vowels front &amp; the breathy ones back, or are those two divisions independent?--&gt; There is little change in vowel quality when the vowel is lengthened. Each vowel has a harmonic counterpart, and every vowel within a harmonic group (which notably can be larger than a word in Somali) must harmonize with the other vowels. The Somali orthography, however, does not distinguish between the two harmonic variants of each vowel.

There are five diphthongs that also occur in front and back, long and short versions, except for {{IPA|/ɞi/}}, which does not appear to occur in the back series.{{fix|text=contradicted by a table below|date=January 2017}}

==Tone==
Lexical prominence in Somali can be classified under a [[pitch accent]] system, in which there is one [[Tone (linguistics)|high-tone]] mora per word.

The tone system distinguishes both grammatical and lexical differences. Differences include numbers singular and plural (a grammatical distinction), and masculine and feminine genders (a grammatical and sometimes also lexical distinction). One example is ''inán'' ('girl') versus ''ínan'' ('boy'). This reflects a tonal pattern that codes grammatical gender, such as ''dameér'' ('female donkey') versus ''daméer'' ('male donkey').

The question of the tone system in Somali has been debated for decades. The modern consensus is as follows.

In Somali, the tone-bearing unit is the [[Mora (linguistics)|mora]] rather than the vowel of the syllable. A long vowel or a diphthong consists of two morae and can bear two tones. Each mora is defined as being of high or low tone. Only one high tone occurs per word and this must be on the final or penultimate mora. Particles do not have a high tone. (These include prepositions, clitic pronouns for subject and object, impersonal subject pronouns and focus markers.) There are therefore three possible "accentual patterns" in word roots.

Phonetically there are three tones on long vowels: high, low and falling:
# On a long vowel or diphthong, a sequence of high-low is realised as a falling tone.
# On a long vowel or diphthong, a sequence of low-high is realised as high-high. (Occasionally, it is a rising tone.)

This use of tone may be characterized as [[pitch accent]]. It is similar to that in [[Oromo language|Oromo]].

[[Stress (linguistics)|Stress]] is connected with tone. The high tone has strong stress; the falling tone has less stress and the low tone has no stress.

When needed, the conventions for marking tone on written Somali are as follows:
* [[acute accent]] - high tone
* [[grave accent]] - low tone
* [[circumflex]] - falling tone

Tones on long vowels are marked on the first vowel symbol.{{dubious|date=June 2015}}

==Phonotactics==
The syllable structure of Somali is (C)V(C).

Root morphemes usually have a mono- or di-syllabic structure.

Clusters of two consonants do not occur word-initially or word-finally, i.e., they only occur at syllable boundaries. The following consonants can be geminate: {{IPA|/b/}}, {{IPA|/d/}}, {{IPA|/ɖ/}}, {{IPA|/ɡ/}}, {{IPA|/ɢ/}}, {{IPA|/m/}}, {{IPA|/n/}}, {{IPA|/r/}} and {{IPA|/l/}}. The following cannot be geminate: {{IPA|/t/}}, {{IPA|/k/}} and the fricatives.

Two vowels cannot occur together at syllable boundaries. Epenthetic consonants, e.g. {{IPA|[j]}} and {{IPA|[ʔ]}}, are therefore inserted.

{{IPA|/dʒ}} does not occur syllable-final in native Somali words but it does in Arabic{{dubious|reason=neighboring Arabic dialects don't have /tʃ/|date=December 2013}} loans.

==Phonological processes==

===Allophones===
{{Contradict|section|date=November 2015}}

* The voiced stops ({{IPA|/b/}}, {{IPA|/d/}}, {{IPA|/ɡ/}} and {{IPA|/ɖ/}}) are devoiced in word-initial and word-final position. Between two vowels they become fricatives.
* The voiceless stops {{IPA|/t/}} and {{IPA|/k/}} are realised as {{IPA|[d]}} and {{IPA|[ɡ]}} in syllable-final position.
* {{IPA|/m/}} is realised as {{IPA|[n]}} in syllable-final position.
* Between vowels, {{IPA|/h/}} is usually voiced to {{IPA|[ɦ]}}.
* All vowels are nasalised before or after a nasal consonant.

===Epenthesis===
When a vowel occurs in word-initial position, a glottal stop ({{IPA|[ʔ]}}) is inserted before it.

===Elision===
Trisyllabic roots with the form (C)VCVCV and a short second vowel elide this vowel to become (C)VCCV except if it would result in {{IPA|/t/}} or {{IPA|/k/}} occurring at the end of a syllable or being geminate.

===Sandhi===
Phonological changes occur at morpheme boundaries ([[sandhi]]) for specific grammatical morphemes. There may be assimilation or elision. One unusual change which can occur is {{IPA|/lt/}} to {{IPA|[ʃ]}}.

[[Coalescence (linguistics)|Coalescence]] also occurs. &lt;!--According to the article, liaison is insertion of a consonant, but in Somali the sandhi is usually elision--&gt; This is a kind of external [[sandhi]] in which words join, undergoing phonological processes such as elision. In Somali it is sometimes obligatory and sometimes it is dependent on the speech style.

===Vowel harmony===
Roots have front-back [[vowel harmony]]. There is also a process of vowel harmony in strings longer than a word, known as "harmonic groups".

==Prosody==
[[Intonation (linguistics)|Intonation]] (as opposed to [[Tone (linguistics)|tone]], see above) does not carry grammatical information although it may convey the speaker's attitude or emotion.

The '''''Star Wars'' prequel trilogy''' is a set of three prequel films in the ''[[Star Wars]]'' franchise, an American [[space opera]] created by [[George Lucas]]. Like the [[Star Wars Trilogy|original trilogy]], it was produced by [[Lucasfilm Ltd.]] and distributed by [[20th Century Fox]]. The trilogy consists of ''[[Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace|The Phantom Menace]]'' (1999), ''[[Star Wars: Episode II – Attack of the Clones|Attack of the Clones]]'' (2002), and ''[[Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith|Revenge of the Sith]]'' (2005). The first two films received mixed reviews, while the third was somewhat more well received.

According to producer Gary Kurtz, loose plans for a prequel trilogy were developed during the outlining of the original two films.&lt;ref name=kurtz&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theforce.net/latestnews/story/gary_kurtz_reveals_original_plans_for_episodes_19_80270.asp|title=Gary Kurtz Reveals Original Plans for Episodes 1-9|website=TheForce.net|date=May 26, 1999|accessdate=September 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1980, Lucas confirmed that he had the nine-film series plotted,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.jeditemplearchives.com/specialreports/banthatracks/archives/banthatracks08.pdf|journal=Bantha Tracks|title=Interview: George Lucas|issue=8|year=1980|last=Lucas|first=George}}&lt;/ref&gt; but due to the stress of producing the original trilogy and pressure from his wife to settle down, he had decided to cancel further sequels by 1981.{{Sfn|Kaminski|2008|p=494}}

Technical advances in the late 1980s and early 1990s, including the ability to create [[computer-generated imagery]], inspired Lucas to consider that it might be possible to revisit his saga. In 1989, Lucas stated that the prequel trilogy would be "unbelievably expensive."{{Sfn|Kaminski|2008|p=303}} After viewing an early CGI test created by [[Industrial Light &amp; Magic]] for ''[[Jurassic Park]]'', Lucas said:
&lt;blockquote&gt;We did a test for Steven Spielberg; and when we put them up on the screen I had tears in my eyes. It was like one of those moments in history, like the invention of the lightbulb or the first telephone call. A major gap had been crossed and things were never going to be the same.{{Sfn|Kaminski|2008|p=311}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1992, Lucas acknowledged that he had plans to create the prequel trilogy in the ''[[Star Wars Insider|Lucasfilm Fan Club]]'' magazine, and announced this to ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' in late 1993.{{Sfn|Kaminski|2008|p=312}} Producer [[Rick McCallum]] reached out to [[Frank Darabont]], who had had previously written ''[[The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles]]'' and ''[[The Shawshank Redemption]]'', for possible future writing duties.{{Sfn|Kaminski|2008|p=315}} He was considered until at least 1995, but as time went on, Lucas continued writing the screenplays himself.{{Sfn|Kaminski|2008|pp=338-39}} The popularity of the franchise had been prolonged by the [[Star Wars expanded to other media|''Star Wars'' Expanded Universe]], so that it still had a large audience. A theatrical [[Changes in Star Wars re-releases|rerelease]] of the original trilogy in 1997 "updated" the 20-year-old films with the style of CGI envisioned for the new episodes.

''[[Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace|Episode I: The Phantom Menace]]'' was released on May 19, 1999, and ''[[Star Wars: Episode II – Attack of the Clones|Episode II: Attack of the Clones]]'' on May 16, 2002, both to mixed reviews. ''[[Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith|Episode III: Revenge of the Sith]]'', the first {{nowrap|PG-13}} film in the franchise, was released on May 19, 2005.&lt;ref name="release dates"&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=March 27, 2008|url=http://www.starwars.com/episode-iii/bts/production/news20040405.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080415144223/http://www.starwars.com/episode-iii/bts/production/news20040405.html|archivedate=April 15, 2008|title=Episode III Release Dates Announced|website=StarWars.com|date=April 5, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; The plot of the trilogy focuses on the fall of the [[Galactic Republic]], the formation of the Empire, and the tragedy of Anakin Skywalker's turn to the dark side.

===''Episode I: The Phantom Menace''===
{{main|Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace}}
32 years before the events of the original film, two Jedi, acting as negotiators of the Republic, discover that the corrupt [[Trade Federation]] has formed a blockade around the planet [[Naboo]]. Sith Lord Darth Sidious has secretly caused the blockade to give his alter ego, Senator Palpatine, a pretense to overthrow and replace the Supreme Chancellor of the Republic. Jedi Master [[Qui-Gon Jinn]] and his apprentice, the young Obi-Wan Kenobi, encounter a native of Naboo who helps them find the Queen of Naboo. With Queen [[Padmé Amidala]], they escape the blockade, but not without their starship being damaged. Landing on Tatooine for repairs, they meet a nine-year-old slave named Anakin Skywalker. Qui-Gon helps liberate the boy by betting with his master in a podrace, believing him to be the "[[Messiah|Chosen One]]" prophesied by the Jedi to bring balance to the Force. Sidious dispatches his Sith apprentice, [[Darth Maul]], to attack the Queen's Jedi protectors. Arriving on [[Coruscant]] so the Queen can plead Naboo's crisis before the Republic Senate, Anakin is brought before the Jedi Council, where Yoda senses that he possesses too much fear.&lt;ref name="star wars 1"&gt;{{Cite video|title=[[Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace]]|publisher=[[20th Century Fox]]|date=2001|medium=DVD}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The prequels were originally planned to fill in history tangential to the original trilogy, but Lucas realized that they could form the first half of one long story focusing on Anakin.{{Sfn|Kaminski|2008|pp=299–300}} This would shape the film series into a self-contained saga. In 1994, Lucas began writing the screenplay for the first prequel, initially titled ''Episode I: The Beginning''. Following the film's release, Lucas announced that he would be directing the next two.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|journal=Star Wars Insider|title=Star Wars Insider|issue=45|page=19|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Episode II: Attack of the Clones''===
{{main|Star Wars: Episode II – Attack of the Clones}}
[[File:Warwick Davis &amp; Anthony Daniels 2.jpg|thumb|168px|right|[[Warwick Davis]] and [[Anthony Daniels]] have appeared in films across all three trilogies as well as in anthology films.]]
10 years after the Battle of Naboo, an assassination attempt is made on former Queen Padmé Amidala, who is serving as the Senator of Naboo. Obi-Wan and his apprentice Anakin are assigned to protect her; Obi-Wan tracks the killer, while Anakin and Padmé retreat to Naboo. They soon fall in love with each other, albeit secretly due to the Jedi Order's rule against attachment. Meanwhile, Chancellor Palpatine schemes to draw the entire galaxy into the "[[Clone Wars (Star Wars)|Clone War]]" between the Republic army led by the Jedi, and the Confederacy of Independent Systems led by [[Count Dooku]] (the former master of Obi-Wan's deceased master Qui-Gon, and Palpatine's new Sith apprentice).&lt;ref name="star wars 2"&gt;{{Cite video|title= [[Star Wars: Episode II – Attack of the Clones]]|publisher= [[20th Century Fox]]| date = 2002 | medium = DVD}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first draft of ''Episode II'' was completed just weeks before principal photography, and Lucas hired [[Jonathan Hales]], a writer from ''[[The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles]]'', to polish it.{{Sfn|Kaminski|2008|p=371}} Unsure of a title, Lucas had jokingly called the film "Jar Jar's Great Adventure".{{Sfn|Kaminski|2008|p=374}} In writing ''The Empire Strikes Back'', Lucas initially considered that Lando Calrissian was a [[cloning|clone]] from a planet of clones which caused the Clone Wars mentioned in ''A New Hope''.{{Sfn|Bouzereau|1997|p=196}}{{Sfn|Kaminski|2008|p=158}} He later came up with the concept of an army of clone [[Shock troops|shock trooper]]s from a remote planet which attacked the Republic and were resisted by the Jedi.{{Sfn|Kaminski|2008|p=162}}

===''Episode III: Revenge of the Sith''===
{{main|Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith}}
Three years into the Clone Wars, Anakin and Obi-Wan lead a rescue mission to save Chancellor Palpatine from Count Dooku and the droid commander [[General Grievous]]. Anakin begins to have prophetic visions of his secret wife Padmé dying in childbirth. Palpatine, who had been secretly engineering the Clone Wars to destroy the Jedi Order, convinces Anakin that the dark side of the Force holds the power to save Padmé's life. Desperate, Anakin submits to Palpatine and is renamed Darth Vader. Palpatine orders the clone army to fire on their Jedi generals, and declares the former Republic an Empire. Vader participates in the extermination of the Jedi, culminating in a lightsaber duel with Obi-Wan on the volcanic planet [[List of Star Wars planets and moons#Mustafar|Mustafar]].&lt;ref name="star wars 3"&gt;{{Cite video|title=[[Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith]]|medium=DVD|date=2005|publisher=[[20th Century Fox]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Work on ''Episode III'' began before ''Episode II'' was released, with one scene shot during the earlier film's production. Lucas originally told concept artists that the film would open with a montage of the Clone Wars,{{Sfn |Rinzler|2005|pp=13–15}} and included a scene of Palpatine revealing to Anakin that he had willed his conception through [[The Force#Prequel films and midi-chlorians|the Force]].{{Sfn|Rinzler|2005|p=42}} Lucas reviewed and radically reorganized the plot,{{Sfn|Rinzler|2005|p=36}} having Anakin execute Dooku in the first act to foreshadow his fall to the dark side.{{Sfn|Kaminski|2008|pp=380–84}} After principal photography was completed in 2003, Lucas made more changes, rewriting Anakin's arc. He would now primarily turn to the dark side in a quest to save Padmé, rather than just believing that the Jedi are plotting to take over the Republic. The rewrite was accomplished both through editing principal footage, and filming new and revised scenes during pick-ups in 2004.&lt;ref name="star wars 3 documentary"&gt;{{Cite video | title =Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith documentary "Within a Minute"|medium=DVD documentary|date= 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4073">In [[logic]], the term '''statement''' is variously understood to mean either: 
: (a) a meaningful [[declarative sentence]] that is [[Truth|true]] or [[false (logic)|false]], or
: (b) the ''assertion'' that is made by a true or false declarative [[Sentence (mathematical logic)|sentence]].
In the latter case, a statement is distinct from a [[Sentence (linguistics)|sentence]] in that a sentence is only one [[formulation (logic)|formulation]] of a statement, whereas there may be many other formulations expressing the same statement.

==Overview==
[[Philosophy of language|Philosopher of language]], [[Peter Strawson]] advocated the use of the term "statement" in sense (b) in preference to [[proposition]].  Strawson used the term "Statement" to make the point that two declarative sentences can make the same statement if they say the same thing in different ways.  Thus in the usage advocated by Strawson, "All men are mortal."  and "Every man is mortal."  are two different sentences that make the same statement.

In either case a statement is viewed as a [[truthbearer|truth bearer]].

Examples of sentences that are (or make) statements:

*"Socrates is a man."
*"A triangle has three sides."
*"Madrid is the capital of Spain."

Examples of sentences that are not (or do not make) statements:

*"Who are you?"
*"Run!"
*"Greenness perambulates."
*"I had one grunch but the eggplant over there."
*"The King of France is wise."
*"Broccoli tastes good."
*"Pegasus exists."

The first two examples are not '''declarative''' sentences and therefore are not (or do not make) statements.
The third and fourth are declarative sentences but, lacking meaning, are neither true nor false and therefore are not (or do not make) statements.  The fifth and sixth examples are meaningful declarative sentences, but are not statements but rather matters of opinion or taste.  Whether or not the sentence "Pegasus exists." is a statement is a subject of debate among philosophers.  [[Bertrand Russell]] held that it is a (false) statement.  Strawson held it is not a statement at all.

== As an abstract entity ==
In some treatments "statement" is introduced in order to distinguish a sentence from its informational content. A statement is regarded as the information content of an information-bearing sentence. Thus, a sentence is related to the statement it bears like a numeral to the number it refers to. Statements are abstract [[logic|logical entities]], while sentences are [[grammar|grammatical entities]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rouse}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ruzsa|2000|p=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Africa]]n [[traditional music|music traditions]] exhibit so many common features that they may in some respects be thought of as constituting a single musical system.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, A.M. (1959), ''Studies in African Music'', London: Oxford University Press. 1978 edition: {{ISBN|978-0-19-713512-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; While some [[Africa]]n music is clearly contemporary-[[popular music]] and some is [[art-music]], still a great deal is communal and [[oral history|orally]] transmitted while still qualifying as a religious or courtly genre.

==Music and dance in African societies==
[[File:The native African dance at Dakawa,Morogoro,Tanzania.JPG|thumb|left|280px|Drumming and dancing at Dakawa, Morogoro, Tanzania]]

In many parts of Africa the use of music is not limited to entertainment: it serves a purpose to the local community and helps in the conduct of daily routines. Traditional African music supplies appropriate music and dance for work and for religious ceremonies of birth, naming, rites of passage, marriage and funerals.&lt;ref&gt;C. Stapleton and C. May, ''African All-stars'', Paladin 1989, page 5.&lt;/ref&gt; The beats and sounds of the drum are used in communication as well as in cultural expression.&lt;ref&gt;[http://search.eb.com/eb/article-57072"  African music." ''Encyclopædia Britannica''. 2009. Encyclopædia Britannica Online]{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[African dance]]s are largely participatory: there are traditionally no barriers between dancers and onlookers except with regard to spiritual, religious and initiation dances. Even ritual dances often have a time when spectators participate.&lt;ref&gt;''African Dance''. Kariamu Welsh, 2004, Chelsea House Publishers, page 35. {{ISBN|0791076415}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dances help people work, mature, praise or criticize members of the community, celebrate festivals and funerals, compete, recite history, proverbs and poetry and encounter gods.&lt;ref&gt;''Steppin' on the Blues'' by Jacqui Malone. University of Illinois Press. 1996. page 9. {{ISBN|0-252-02211-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; They inculcate social patterns and values. Many dances are performed by only males or females.&lt;ref&gt;''African Dance''. Kariamu Welsh, 2004, Chelsea House Publishers, pages 19,21. {{ISBN|0791076415}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dances are often segregated by gender, reinforcing gender roles in children. Community structures such as kinship, age, and status are also often reinforced.&lt;ref&gt;''Africana: The Encyclopedia of the African and African American Experience'' by Henry Louis Gates, Anthony Appiah 1999 Basic Civics Books page 556 {{ISBN|0-465-00071-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; To share rhythm is to form a group consciousness, to [[Entrainment (biomusicology)|entrain]] with one another,&lt;ref&gt;[http://mickeyhart.net/Pages/senspeech.html Rhythm As A Tool For Healing and Health in The Aging process] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723210230/http://mickeyhart.net/Pages/senspeech.html |date=July 23, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; to be part of the collective rhythm of life to which all are invited to contribute.&lt;ref name="Sebastian Bakare 1997"&gt;Sebastian Bakare, ''The Drumbeat of Life'', WCC  Publications, Geneva, Switzerland. 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Africa ethnic groups 1996.jpg|thumb|right|African ethnic groups]]

Yoruba dancers and drummers, for instance, express communal desires, values, and collective creativity. The drumming represents an underlying linguistic text that guides the dancing performance, allowing linguistic meaning to be expressed non-verbally. The spontaneity of these performances should not be confused with an improvisation that emphasizes the individual ego. The drummer's primary duty is to preserve the community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comm.unt.edu/histofperf/nonwest/downing/topic_three.htm |title=Topic Three |publisher=Department of Communication Studies, University of North Texas |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100803131108/http://www.comm.unt.edu/histofperf/nonwest/downing/topic_three.htm |archivedate=August 3, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Master dancers and drummers are particular about the learning of the dance exactly as taught. Children must learn the dance exactly as taught without variation. Improvisation or a new variation comes only after mastering the dance, performing, and receiving the appreciation of spectators and the sanction of village elders.&lt;ref&gt;Zimbabwe Dance''. Kariamu Welsh Asante. Africa World Press, Inc. 2000, p. 60 {{ISBN|0-86543-492-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The music of the Luo, for another example, is functional, used for ceremonial, religious, political or incidental purposes, during funerals (Tero buru) to praise the departed, to console the bereaved, to keep people awake at night, to express pain and agony and during cleansing and chasing away of spirits, during beer parties (Dudu, ohangla dance), welcoming back the warriors from a war, during a wrestling match (Ramogi), during courtship, in rain making  and during divination and healing. Work songs are performed both during communal work like building, weeding, etc. and individual work like pounding of cereals, winnowing.

==Regions==
[[File:Afrika MO.jpg|thumb|220px|Geo-political map of Africa divided for ethnomusicological purposes, after Merriam, 1959.]]
[[Alan P. Merriam]] divided Africa into seven regions for ethnomusicological purposes, observing current political frontiers ''(see map)'', and this article follows this division as far as possible in surveying the music of [[ethnic groups in Africa]].

* Music of the '''northern''' region of Africa'' (red on the map)'', including that of the [[Horn of Africa]] ''(dark green on the map)'', is mostly treated separately under [[Middle Eastern and North African music traditions]].
* '''[[West African music]]''' ''(yellow on the map)'' includes the [[music of Senegal]] and [[Music of The Gambia|the Gambia]], of [[Music of Guinea|Guinea]] and [[Music of Guinea-Bissau|Guinea-Bissau]], [[Music of Sierra Leone|Sierra Leone]] and [[Music of Liberia|Liberia]], of the inland plains of [[Music of Mali|Mali]], [[Music of Niger|Niger]] and [[Music of Burkina Faso|Burkina Faso]] and also the coastal nations of [[Music of Cote d'Ivoire|Côte d'Ivoire]], [[Music of Ghana|Ghana]], [[Music of Togo|Togo]], [[Music of Benin|Benin]], [[Music of Nigeria|Nigeria]], [[Music of Cameroon|Cameroon]], [[Music of Gabon|Gabon]] and [[Music of the Republic of the Congo|the Republic of the Congo]] as well as the islands of [[Music of Cape Verde|Cape Verde]], [[Music of Sao Tome and Principe|São Tomé and Príncipe]].
* '''Central African Music''' ''(dark blue on the map)'' includes the [[music of Chad]], [[Music of the Central African Republic|the Central African Republic]], [[Music of the Democratic Republic of the Congo|the Democratic Republic of the Congo]] and [[Music of Zambia|Zambia]].
* The '''Eastern''' region ''(light green on the map)'' includes the [[music of Uganda]], [[Music of Kenya|Kenya]], [[Music of Rwanda|Rwanda]], [[Music of Burundi|Burundi]], [[Music of Tanzania|Tanzania]], [[Music of Malawi|Malawi]], [[Music of Mozambique|Mozambique]] and [[Music of Zimbabwe|Zimbabwe]] as well as the islands of  [[Music of Madagascar|Madagascar]], [[Music of the Seychelles|the Seychelles]], [[Music of Réunion|Réunion]], [[Music of Mauritius|Mauritius]] and  [[Comorian music|Comoros]]. The eastern region has received south Asian and even [[Austronesia]]n influences via the [[Indian Ocean]].
* The '''Southern''' region ''(brown on the map)'' includes the [[music of South Africa]], [[Music of Lesotho|Lesotho]], [[Music of Swaziland|Swaziland]], [[Music of Botswana|Botswana]], [[Music of Namibia|Namibia]] and [[Music of Angola|Angola]].

===Sahel and Sudan===

* The [[music of Sudan]] ''(turquoise on the map)'' indicates the difficulty of dividing music traditions according to state frontiers. The musicology of Sudan involves some 133 language communities.&lt;ref name="Ethnologue"&gt;Gordon, Raymond G., Jr. (ed.), [http://www.ethnologue.com/show_country.asp?name=SD ''Languages of Sudan''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130203003032/http://www.ethnologue.com/show_country.asp?name=SD |date=February 3, 2013 }}, Ethnologue: Languages of the World, 15th ed., Dallas: SIL International, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; that speak over 400 dialects,&lt;ref&gt;Bechtold, Peter R.

Sudan takes its name from that of the sub-Saharan savanna which makes, with the [[Nile]], a great cross-roads of the region. South of the Sahara the ''[[Sahel]]'' forms a [[Terrestrial ecozone|bio-geographic zone]] of transition between the desert and the [[Sudanian Savanna]]s, stretching between the [[Atlantic Ocean]] and the [[Red Sea]]. The [[Nilotic peoples]] prominent in [[southern Sudan]], Uganda, Kenya, and northern Tanzania, include the [[Luo (family of ethnic groups)|Luo]], [[Dinka]], [[Nuer people|Nuer]] and [[Maasai people|Maasai]].&lt;ref name=bartleby&gt;[http://www.bartleby.com/61/85/N0108500.html "Nilotic", The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language: Fourth Edition.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090217071703/http://www.bartleby.com/61/85/N0108500.html |date=February 17, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these have been included in the Eastern region.

[[File:Sahel-Sudan.png|thumb|left|300px|The sahel (brown) and the Sudan (green)]]

* The [[Dinka]] are a mainly agro-pastoral people inhabiting the [[Bahr el Ghazal (region of South Sudan)|Bahr el Ghazal]] region of the [[Nile]] basin, [[Jonglei]] and parts of southern [[Kordufan]] and [[Upper Nile, Sudan|Upper Nile]] regions. They number around 1.5 million, about 10% of the population.&lt;ref&gt;Ancient Historical Society Virtual Museum, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; of Sudan.
* The Arabian ''[[rebab]]'' has found a home among the [[Nuba peoples]].

The [[Senegambian languages|Senegambian]] [[Fula people|Fula]] have migrated as far as Sudan at various times, often speaking Arabic as well as their own language. The [[Hausa people]], who speak a [[Afroasiatic languages|language]] related to [[Egyptian language|Ancient Egyptian]] and [[Biblical Hebrew]], have moved in the opposite direction. Further west the [[Berber music]] of the [[Tuareg people|Tuareg]] has penetrated to Sub-Saharan countries. These are included in the Western region, but the music of Sub-Saharan herders and nomads is heard from west to east.

===Western, central, eastern and southern territories===

[[File:Niger saharan medieval trade routes.PNG|thumb|300px|right|Saharan trade routes circa 1400]]

These remaining four regions are most associated with Sub-Saharan African music: familiar African musical elements such as the use of [[cross-beat]] and [[vocal harmony]] may be found all over all four regions, as may be some instruments such as the iron bell. This is largely due to the [[Bantu expansion|expansion]] of the [[Niger–Congo languages|Niger–Congo-speaking people]] that began around 1500 BC: the last phases of expansion were 0–1000&amp;nbsp;AD.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.txstate.edu/anthropology/cas/journal_articles/herder.pdf The Chronological Evidence for the Introduction of Domestic Stock in Southern Africa]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090325021249/http://www.txstate.edu/anthropology/cas/journal_articles/herder.pdf |date=March 25, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thuto.org/ubh/bw/bhp1.htm A Brief History of Botswana] {{webarchive |url=https://www.webcitation.org/5mrB471UT?url=http://www.thuto.org/ubh/bw/bhp1.htm |date=January 17, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://elaine.ihs.ac.at/~isa/diplom/node59.html On Bantu and Khoisan in (Southeastern) Zambia, (in German)]  {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/5mrB4745q?url=http://elaine.ihs.ac.at/~isa/diplom/node59.html |date=January 17, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Only a few scattered languages in this great area cannot readily be associated with the Niger–Congo language family. However two significant non-Bantu musical traditions, the  [[Pygmy music]] of the Congo jungle and that of the [[bushmen]] of the [[Kalahari]], do much to define the music of the central region  and of the southern region respectively.

==West Africa==

[[File:Kora boy gambia apr2006.jpg|thumb|left|220px|Gambian boy with bowed tin-can lute]]

The [[music of West Africa]] must be considered under two main headings: in its northernmost and westernmost parts, many of the above-mentioned transnational sub-Saharan ethnic influences are found among the Hausa, the Fulani, the [[Wolof people]], the [[Mande languages|Mande speakers]] of [[Mali]], [[Senegal]] and [[Mauritania]], the [[Gur languages|Gur]]-speaking peoples of [[Mali]], [[Burkina Faso]] and the northern halves of [[Ghana]], [[Togo]] and [[Cote d'Ivoire]], the [[Fula language|Fula]] found throughout West Africa, and the [[Senufo languages|Senufo speakers]] of [[Côte d'Ivoire]] and [[Mali]].

The coastal regions are home to the [[Niger-Congo languages|Niger-Congo]] speakers; [[Kwa languages|Kwa]], [[Akan language|Akan]], the [[Gbe languages]], spoken in [[Ghana]], [[Togo]], [[Benin]], and [[Nigeria]], of which [[Ewe language|Ewe]] is best known, the [[Yoruba language|Yoruba]] and [[Igbo language|Igbo]] languages, spoken in [[Nigeria]] and the [[Benue–Congo languages]] of the east.

Inland and coastal languages are only distantly related. While the north, with its ''[[griot]]'' traditions, makes great use of stringed instruments and [[xylophone]]s, the south relies much more upon drum sets and communal singing.

===Northern===

[[File:Kora (African lute instrument).jpg|thumb|right|The Malian [[Kora (instrument)|kora]] harp-lute is perhaps the most sophisticated of Africa's stringed instruments]]

Complex societies existed in the region from about 1500 BCE. The [[Ghana Empire]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|author=Lange|title=Ancient kingdoms of West Africa,|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=syATJKcx5A0C|year=2004|pages=[https://books.google.com/books?id=syATJKcx5A0C&amp;pg=PA459  509–516]|isbn=978-3-89754-115-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; existed from before c. 830 until c. 1235 in what is now south-east [[Mauritania]] and western [[Mali]]. The [[Sosso people]] had their capital at [[Koumbi Saleh]] until [[Sundiata Keita]] defeated them at the [[Battle of Kirina]] (c. 1240) and began the [[Mali Empire]], which  spread its influence along the [[Niger River]] through numerous [[vassal]] kingdoms and provinces. The [[Gao Empire]] at the eastern Niger bend was powerful in the ninth century CE but later subordinated to Mali until its decline. In 1340 the [[Songhai people]] made Gao the capital of a new [[Songhai Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;Haskins, p. 46&lt;/ref&gt;

* The [[Hausa people]] are one of the largest [[ethnic group]]s in [[Nigeria]], [[Niger]], [[Sudan]] and many West and Central African countries. They speak a [[Chadic]] language. There are two broad categories of traditional [[Hausa music]]; rural folk music and urban court music developed in the [[Hausa Kingdoms]] before the [[Fulani War]]. Their folk music has played an important part in [[music of Nigeria|Nigerian music]], contributing elements such as the [[goje]], a one-stringed [[fiddle]].
* The originally nomadic/pastoral Senegambian [[Fula people]] or [[Tukulor]] represent 40% of the population of [[Guinea]] and have spread to surrounding states and as far as [[Sudan]] in the east.&lt;ref&gt;{{CIA World Factbook link|gv|Guinea}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 19th century they overthrew the Hausa and established the [[Sokoto Caliphate]]. The Fula play a variety of traditional instruments including drums, the ''hoddu'' (''[[xalam]]''), a plucked skin-covered lute similar to a banjo, and ''riti'' or ''riiti'' (a one-string bowed instrument similar to a violin), in addition to their vocal music. They also use end-blown bamboo flutes. Their griots are known as ''gawlo''.&lt;ref&gt;Hudson, Mark with Jenny Cathcart and Lucy Duran, "Senegambian Stars Are Here to Stay" in the ''Rough Guide to World Music'', pp. 617–633; Karolyi, p. 42&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Mande music]]: the [[music of Mali]] is dominated by forms derived from the Mande Empire Their musicians, professional performers called [[griot|jeliw]] (sing. ''jeli'', French ''griot''), have produced popular  alongside traditional  music. [[Mande languages]] include [[Mandinka language|Mandinka]], [[Soninke language|Soninke]], [[Bambara language|Bambara]], [[Bissa people|Bissa]], [[Dioula language|Dioula]], [[Kagoro]], [[Bozo languages|Bozo]], [[Mende language|Mende]], [[Susu language|Susu]], [[Vai language|Vai]] and [[Ligbi language|Ligbi]]: there are populations in Burkina Faso, Mauritania, Senegal, The Gambia, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Sierra Leone and Liberia and, mainly in the northern inland regions, in the south coast states of Côte d'Ivoire, Ghana, Togo, Benin and Nigeria.
* [[Wolof music]]: the [[Wolof people]], the largest [[ethnic group]] in [[Senegal]], kin to the Fula, have contributed greatly to popular [[music of Senegal|Senegalese music]]. The related [[Serer people]] are notable for polyphonic song.&lt;ref&gt;Hudson, Mark with Jenny Cathcart and Lucy Duran, "Senegambian Stars Are Here to Stay" in the ''Rough Guide to World Music'', pp. 617–633&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Musée diola Boucotte2.jpg|thumb|right|Jola man at Boucotte in Casamance (Sénégal) playing the ''akonting'']]

* In [[Senegal]], [[The Gambia]] and [[Guinea-Bissau]] the [[Jola people#Music|Jola]] are notable for their stringed instrument the ''[[akonting]]'', a precursor of the [[banjo]] while the [[Balanta people]], the largest ethnic group of Guinea-Bissau, play a similar gourd lute instrument called a ''kusunde'' or ''kussundé'',&lt;ref&gt;de Klein, Guus, "The Backyard Beats of Gumbe" in the ''Rough Guide to World Music'', pp. 499–504&lt;/ref&gt; with a short A#/B drone string at the bottom, a top F# string of middle length and a middle C# string, the longest. Top string stopped gives G#, middle string stopped is D#.
* [[Songhai people|Songhai]] music, as interpreted by [[Ali Farka Toure]], has gathered international interest for a minor pentatonic lute-and-voice style that is markedly similar to American blues.
* The [[Senufo people|Senufo or Senoufo]], living in southern [[Mali]] and the extreme western corner of [[Burkina Faso]] to [[Katiola (town)|Katiola]] in [[Côte d'Ivoire]] with one group, the [[Nafana]], in north-western [[Ghana]].

[[File:Balafon children burkina faso.jpg|thumb|right|A performance group from Burkina Faso based on the ''balafon'']]

* Among [[Gur languages|Gur]]-speaking peoples the [[Dagomba people|Dagomba]] use the ''lunga'' talking drum and a bass drum with [[snare drum|snares]] called a ''gungon'',  as well as the flute, ''gonje'' (''goje'') and bell.&lt;ref&gt;Turino, p. 182; Collins, John, "Gold Coast: Highlife and Roots" in the ''Rough Guide to World Music'', pp. 488–498&lt;/ref&gt; as well as  ''molo'' (''[[xalam]]'') lute music, also played by [[Gurunsi peoples]] such as the [[Frafra people|Frafra]]. Similar styles are practised by local Fulani, Hausa, [[Zarma language|Djerma]], [[Busanga]] and [[Ligbi language|Ligbi]] speaking people. Drummers in Dagbon are storytellers, historians, [[bard]]s of family ancestry who perform at events called ''sambanlunga''.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Staniland, ''The Lions of Dagbon'', (1975), Christine Oppong, ''Growing up in Dagbon'', (1973), David Locke, ''Drum Damba'', quoted by Elana Cohen-Khani at {{cite web|url=https://wikis.uit.tufts.edu/confluence/display/DagombaDanceDrumming/About+the+Dagomba |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-01-14 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160803142519/https://wikis.uit.tufts.edu/confluence/display/DagombaDanceDrumming/About+the+Dagomba |archivedate=2016-08-03 |df= }}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Gurunsi]], the [[Lobi people|Lobi]], the [[Wala (people)|Wala]] and the related [[Dagaaba people]] of Ghana and Burkina Faso and are known for complex interlocking (double meter) patterns on the xylophone (''gyil'').
* The [[Mossi people]], whose [[Mossi Kingdoms]] in present-day [[Burkina Faso]], withstood their Songhai and Mende neighbours before falling to the French, have a griot tradition.

[[Yacub Addy]], [[Obo Addy]], and [[Mustapha Tettey Addy]] are Ga drummers who have achieved international fame. A huge log xylophone is used in ''asonko'' music. The 10–14 string Ghanaian ''seprewa'', midway between the kora and the [[African harp]], is still played but often replaced by guitar. Other styles include; ''adaha, agbadza, akwete, [[ashiko]]'' and ''gombe'' as well as ''[[konkomba]]'', mainline, ''osibisaba'' and ''sikyi''.

==Central Africa==
[[File:CentAfrica-satmusic.jpg|thumb|left|The Central African musicological region and the River Congo upon a satellite photograph showing the African tropical rainforest and desert regions.]]
The central region of African music is defined by the tropical rain-forests at the heart of the continent. However Chad, the northernmost state, has a considerable subtropical and desert northern region.

===Northern traditions===
The north of this region has Nilo-Saharans such as the [[Zande people]]. Early kingdoms were founded near [[Lake Chad]]: the [[Kanem Empire]], ca. 600 BCE&amp;nbsp;– 1380 CE&lt;ref&gt;Lange, [http://dierklange.com/pdf/reviews/dierklange_allgemein/FOUNDING_9.5.2011.pdf ''Founding of Kanem''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160327220249/http://dierklange.com/pdf/reviews/dierklange_allgemein/FOUNDING_9.5.2011.pdf |date=March 27, 2016 }}, 31–38.&lt;/ref&gt; encompassed much of Chad, [[Fezzan]], east [[Niger]] and north-east [[Nigeria]], perhaps founded by the nomadic  [[Zaghawa people|Zaghawa]], then ruled by the [[Sayfawa Dynasty]]. The [[Bornu Empire]] (1396–1893) was a continuation, the [[Kanembu people|Kanembu]] founding a new state at [[Ngazargamu]]. These spoke the [[Kanuri language]]s spoken by some four million people in Nigeria, Niger, Chad, Cameroon, Libya and Sudan. They are noted for lute and drum music. The [[Kingdom of Baguirmi]] (1522–1897) and the [[Ouaddai Empire]] (1635–1912) were also centred near Lake Chad.

* The [[Toubou]], who live mainly in the north of [[Music of Chad|Chad]] around the [[Tibesti mountains]] and also in [[Libya]], [[Niger]] and [[Sudan]], are semi-nomadic  herders, Nilo-Saharan speakers, mostly [[Muslim]],  numbering roughly 350,000.

===Bantu traditions===

* [[Bemba people]] of Zambia.   (or 'BaBemba' using the Ba- prefix to mean 'people of', and also called 'Awemba' or 'BaWemba' in the past) belong to a large group of peoples mainly in the [[Northern Province, Zambia|Northern]], [[Luapula Province|Luapula]] and [[Copperbelt]] Provinces of [[Zambia]] who trace their origins to the Luba and Lunda states of the upper [[Congo basin]], in what became [[Katanga Province]] in southern [[Congo-Kinshasa]] (DRC). There are over 30 Bemba clans, named after animals or natural organisms, such as the royal clan, "the people of the crocodile" (Bena Ng'andu) or the Bena Bowa (Mushroom Clan). The [[Bemba language]] (Chibemba) is related to the [[Bantu languages]] Kaonde (in Zambia and the DRC), Luba (in the DRC), Nsenga and Tonga (in Zambia), and Nyanja/[[Chewa language|Chewa]] (in Zambia and Malawi). It is mainly spoken in the Northern, Luapula and Copperbelt Provinces, and has become the most widely spoken African language in the country, although not always as a first language. Bemba numbered 250,000 in 1963 but a much larger population includes some 'eighteen different ethnic groups' who, together with the Bemba, form a closely related ethno-linguistic cluster of matrilineal-matrifocal agriculturalists known as the Bemba-speaking peoples of Zambia.

==East Africa== 
The East African musicological region, which includes the islands of the Indian Ocean, [[Music of Madagascar|Madagascar]], [[Music of Réunion|Réunion]], [[Music of Mauritius|Mauritius]], [[Comorian music|Comor]] and [[Seychellois music|the Seychelles]], has been open to the influence of [[Arabic music|Arabian]] and [[Music of Iran|Iranian music]] since the [[Shirazi Era]]. In the south of the region [[Swahili culture]] has adopted instruments such as the ''[[dumbek]], [[oud]]'' and ''[[qanun (instrument)|qanun]]''&amp;nbsp;– even the Indian [[tabla]] drums.&lt;ref name="graebner1"&gt;Graebner, Werner, "Mtindo&amp;nbsp;– Dance with Style" in the ''Rough Guide to World Music'', pp. 681–689&lt;/ref&gt; The ''kabosy'', also called the ''mandoliny'', a small guitar of Madagascar, like the Comorian ''gabusi'', may take its name from the Arabian ''[[qanbūs]]''. ''Taarab'', a modern genre popular in Tanzania and Kenya, is said to take both its name and its style from Egyptian music as formerly cultivated in [[Zanzibar]]. Latterly there have been European influences also: the [[guitar]] is popular in [[Kenya]], the [[Country dance|contredanse]], [[mazurka]] and [[polka]] are danced in the Seychelles.&lt;ref name="lightness1"&gt;Ewens, Graeme and Werner Graebner, "A Lightness of Touch" in the ''Rough Guide to World Music'', pp. 505–508&lt;/ref&gt;

===Northern traditions===
* The [[Luo (family of ethnic groups)|Luo peoples]]  inhabit an area that stretches from [[Southern Sudan]] and [[Ethiopia]] through northern [[Uganda]] and eastern [[Congo (DRC)]], into western [[Kenya]] and [[Tanzania]] and include the [[Shilluk people|Shilluk]], [[Acholi people|Acholi]], [[Langi people|Lango]] and [[Luo (Kenya and Tanzania)|Joluo]] (Kenyan and Tanzanian Luo).  Luo [[Benga music]] derives from the traditional music of the ''[[nyatiti]]'' lyre:&lt;ref name="Manuel, Popular Musics, pg. 101"&gt;Manuel, ''Popular Musics'', pg. 101&lt;/ref&gt; the Luo-speaking [[Acholi]] of northern Uganda use the [[adungu]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Turino, pp. 179, 182; Sandahl, Sten, "Exiles and Traditions" in the ''Rough Guide to World Music'', pp. 698–701&lt;/ref&gt; Rhythms are characterized by syncopation and acrusis. Melodies are lyrical, with vocal ornamentations, especially when the music carries an important message. Songs are call-and-response or solo performances such as chants, recitatives with irregular rhythms and phrases which carried serious messages. Luo dances such as the ''dudu'' were introduced by them. A unique characteristic is the introduction of another chant at the middle of a musical performance. The singing stops, the pitch of the musical instruments go down and the dance becomes less vigorous as an individual takes up the performance in self-praise. This is called ''pakruok''. A unique kind of ululation, ''sigalagala'', mainly done by women, marks the climax of the musical performance. Dance styles are elegant and graceful, involving the movement of one leg in the opposite direction to the waist or vigorous shaking of the shoulders, usually to the ''nyatiti''. Adamson (1967) commented that Luos clad in their traditional costumes and ornaments deserve their reputation as the most picturesque people in Kenya. During most of their performances the Luo wore costumes; sisal skirts (owalo), beads (Ombulu / tigo) worn around the neck and waist and red or white clay used by the ladies. The men's costumes included kuodi or chieno, a skin worn from the shoulders or from the waist. Ligisa headgear, shield and spear, reed hats and clubs were made from locally available materials. Luo musical instruments range from percussion (drums, clappers, metal rings, ongeng'o or gara, shakers), nyatiti, a type of lyre; orutu, a type of fiddle), wind (tung' a horn,Asili, a flute, Abu-!, to a specific type of trumpet. In the benga style of music. the guitar (acoustic, later electric) replaced the nyatiti as the string instrument. Benga is played by musicians of many tribes and is no longer considered a purely Luo style.
* The [[Maasai people#Music and dance|Music and dance of the Maasai people]] used no instruments in the past because as semi-nomadic Nilotic pastoralists instruments were considered too cumbersome to move. Traditional Maasai music is strictly [[polyphony|polyphonic]] [[vocal music]], a group chanting polyphonic rhythms while soloists take turns singing verses. The [[call and response (music)|call and response]] that follows each verse is called ''namba''. Performances are often competitive and divided by age and gender. The neighbouring [[Turkana people]] have maintained their ancient traditions, including call and response music, which is almost entirely vocal. A horn made from the [[kudu]] antelope is also played. The [[Samburu people|Samburu]] are related to the Maasai, and like them, play almost no instruments except simple pipes and a kind of guitar.  There are also erotic songs sung by women praying for rain.
* The [[Borana people|Borana]] live near the [[Ethiopia]]n border, and their music reflects [[music of Ethiopia|Ethiopian]], [[Somali music|Somali]] and other traditions. They are known also for using the [[chamonge guitar]],&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Paterson, Doug, "The Life and Times of Kenyan Pop" in the ''Rough Guide to World Music'', pp. 509–522&lt;/ref&gt;  which is made from a cooking pot strung with metal wires.

Drums (''[[ngoma drums|ngoma]]'', ''ng'oma'' or ''ingoma'') are much used: particularly large ones have been developed among the court musicians of East African kings.

* The [[Kikuyu people|Kikuyu]] are one of the largest and most urbanized communities in Kenya. At the Riuki cultural center in Nairobi traditional songs and dances are still performed by local women, including music for initiations, courting, weddings, hunting, and working. The Kikuyu, like their neighbours the [[Embu people|Embu]] and the [[Meru people|Meru]] are believed to have migrated from the Congo Basin.

The [[Royal Drummers of Burundi]] perform music for [[ceremony|ceremonies]] of birth, funeral and [[coronation]] of ''[[mwami]]'' (kings). [[Sacred]] drums (called [[karyenda]]) are made from hollowed tree trunks covered with animal skins. In addition to the central drum, ''Inkiranya'', the ''Amashako'' drums provide a continuous beat and ''Ibishikiso'' drums follow the rhythm established by the Inkiranya.

* The [[Kamba people]] are known for their complex [[Percussion instrument|percussion]] music and spectacular performances, dances that display athletic skills resemble those of the [[Tutsi]] and the [[Embu people|Embu]]. Dances are usually accompanied by songs composed for the occasion and sung on a [[pentatonic scale]]. The Akamba also have work songs. Their music is divided into several groups based on age: ''Kilumi'' is a dance for mainly elderly women and men performed at healing and rain-making ceremonies,''Mbeni'' for young and acrobatic girls and boys,  ''Mbalya'' or ''Ngutha'' is a dance for young people who meet to entertain themselves after the day's chores are done, ''Kyaa'' for the old men and women.''Kiveve, Kinze'' etc. In the Kilumi dance the drummer, usually female, plays sitting on a large ''mwase'' drum  covered  with goatskin at one end and open at the other. The drummer is also the lead singer. ''Mwali'' (pl: Myali) is a dance accompanying a song usually made to criticize anti-social behaviour: ''Mwilu'' is a circumcision dance.

The '''Taxila copper-plate''', also called the '''Moga inscription''' or the '''Patika copper-plate''' is a notable archaeological artifact found in the area of [[Taxila]], [[punjab]], in modern [[Pakistan]]. It is now in the collection of the [[British Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx?objectId=246755&amp;partId=1&amp;place=39912&amp;plaA=39912-3-2&amp;page=1 British Museum Collection]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Description==
The copper plate is dated to a period between the 1st century BCE and the 1st century CE. It bears an imprecise date: the 5th day of the [[Macedonia (ancient kingdom)|Macedonian]] month of [[Panemos]], in the year 78 of king [[Maues|Moga]]. It is thought it may be related to the establishment of a Maues era, which would give a date around 6 CE.

The copper plate is written in the [[Kharosthi]] script (a script derived from [[Aramaic]]). It relates the dedication of a relic of the [[Buddha Shakyamuni]] ([[Pali]]: ''śakamuni'', literally "Master of the Shakas") to a Buddhist monastery by the [[Indo-Scythian]] (Pali: "śaka") ruler [[Patika Kusulaka]], son of [[Liaka Kusulaka]], satrap of [[Chukhsa]], near Taxila.

The inscription is significant in that it documents the fact that Indo-Scythians practiced the Buddhist faith. It is also famous for mentioning Patika Kusulaka, who also appears as a "Great Satrap" in the [[Mathura lion capital]] inscription.

'''''The Burial of the Count of Orgaz''''' (Spanish: El Entierro del Conde de Orgaz) is a 1586 painting by [[El Greco]], a prominent [[Renaissance]] [[painting|painter]], [[sculpture|sculptor]], and [[architecture|architect]] of [[Greeks|Greek]] origin. Widely considered among his finest works, it illustrates a popular local legend of his time. An exceptionally large painting, it is divided into two sections, heavenly above and terrestrial below, but it gives little impression of duality, since the upper and lower sections are brought together compositionally.

The painting has been lauded by art scholars, characterized, ''inter alia'', as "one of the most truthful pages in the history of Spain", as a masterpiece of [[Art of Europe|Western Art]] and of late [[Mannerism]], and as the epitome of Greco's artistic style.&lt;ref&gt;M. Lambraki-Plaka, ''A Tribute to El Greco'', 81&lt;br /&gt;* F. Philipp, "El Greco's Entombment", 88–89&lt;br /&gt;* S. Schroth, "Burial of the Count of Orgaz", 1&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theme==
The theme of the painting is inspired from a legend of the beginning of the 14th century. In 1312, a certain Don Gonzalo Ruiz, native of [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]], and Señor of the town of [[Orgaz]], died (his family later received the title of Count, by which he is generally and posthumously known). Don Gonzalo Ruiz was a descendant of the noble [[Palaiologos]] family, which produced the last ruling dynasty of the [[Byzantine Empire]]. A pious [[Gentleman|Caballero]], the Count of Orgaz was also a [[philanthropist]], who, among other charitable acts, left a sum of money for the enlargement and adornment of the [[Iglesia de Santo Tomé, Toledo|church of Santo Tomé]] (El Greco's parish church), where he wanted to be buried.&lt;ref name="Plaka74"&gt;D.F. González, ''Gonzalo Ruiz de Toledo'', 213&lt;br /&gt;* M. Lambraki-Plaka, ''A Tribute to El Greco'', 74&lt;br /&gt;* S. Schroth, "Burial of the Count of Orgaz", 1–4, 7&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the legend, at the time the Count was buried, [[Saint Stephen]] and [[Augustine of Hippo|Saint Augustine]] descended in person from the heavens and buried him by their own hands in front of the dazzled eyes of those present. The event is depicted in the painting, with every detail of the work's subject described in the contract signed between Greco and the Church. The miracle is also mentioned in the Latin epitaphian inscription, set into the wall below the painting.&lt;ref name="Plaka54-55"&gt;M. Lambraki-Plaka, ''El Greco-The Greek'', 54–55&lt;br /&gt;* S. Schroth, "Burial of the Count of Orgaz", 1&lt;/ref&gt; Although Greco abided by the terms of the contract, he introduced some elements which "modernized" the legend, such as a series of features attributed to a 16th century customary funeral procession, the vestments of the two saints, as well as the depiction of eminent Toledan figures of his time. The "modernization" of the legend serves the didactic purpose of the painting, which, in accord with the [[Counter-Reformation]] doctrines, stresses the importance of both the worship of saints and of good deeds for the salvation of the soul.&lt;ref name="Schroth1"&gt;S.

==History==

[[File:El Greco - The Burial of the Count of Orgaz (detail) - WGA10493.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Detail of the painting, showing El Greco]]
The painting was commissioned by Andrés Núñez, the [[parish priest]] of Santo Tomé, for the side-chapel of the Virgin of the church of Santo Tomé.&lt;ref&gt;R.-M. Hagen–R. Hagen, ''What Great Paintings Say'', II, 198&lt;br /&gt;* M. Lambraki-Plaka, ''El Greco-The Greek'', 54&lt;br /&gt;* M. Tazartes, ''El Greco'', 122&lt;/ref&gt; Núñez, who had initiated a project to refurbish the Count's burial chapel, is portrayed in the painting reading (on the right of the lower part of the composition).&lt;ref&gt;M. Lambraki-Plaka, ''A Tribute to El Greco'', 77&lt;br /&gt;* [[Web Gallery of Art]], [http://www.wga.hu/frames-e.html?/html/g/greco_el/09/index.html The Burial of the Count of Orgaz]&lt;/ref&gt; The painting's commission was the last step in the priest's plan to glorify the parish.&lt;ref name="Schroth6"&gt;S. Schroth, "Burial of the Count of Orgaz", 6&lt;/ref&gt;

Signed on 18 March 1586, the contract between Núñez and El Greco laid down specific iconographic demands, stipulated that the artist would pay for the materials, and provided for the delivery of the work until Christmas 1587. Greco must have worked at a frantic pace, and finished the painting between late 1587 and the spring of 1588. A long debate between the priests and the painter followed in relation to the value of the latter's work, for which the contract stipulated that it would be determined by appraisal.&lt;ref&gt;R.L. Kagan, "El Greco and the Law", 85–86&lt;br /&gt;* M. Lambraki-Plaka, ''A Tribute to El Greco'', 75&lt;/ref&gt; Initially intransigent, Greco eventually compromised and settled for the lower first "expert estimate", agreeing to receive 13,200 [[Spanish real|reales]].&lt;ref name="Plaka75"&gt;R.L. Kagan, "El Greco and the Law", 85–86&lt;br /&gt;* M. Lambraki-Plaka, ''A Tribute to El Greco'', 75&lt;br /&gt;* F. Philipp, "El Greco's Entombment", 77&lt;/ref&gt;

Already in 1588, people were flocking to Orgaz to see the painting. This immediate popular reception was mainly due to the realistic portrayal of the notable men of Toledo of the time.&lt;ref name="Plaka54"&gt;M. Lambraki-Plaka, ''El Greco-The Greek'', 54&lt;/ref&gt; It was the custom for the eminent and noble men of the town to assist the burial of the noble-born, and it was stipulated in the contract that the scene should be represented in this manner.&lt;ref name="Web2"&gt;[[Web Gallery of Art]], [http://www.wga.hu/frames-e.html?/html/g/greco_el/09/index.html The Burial of the Count of Orgaz]&lt;/ref&gt;

El Greco would pay homage to the aristocracy of the spirit, the clergy, the jurists, the poets and the scholars, who honored him and his art with their esteem, by immortalizing them in the painting. ''The Burial of the Count of Orgaz'' has been admired not only for its art, but also because it is a gallery of portraits of some of the most important personalities of that time in Toledo. In 1612, [[Francisco de Pisa]] wrote: "The people of our city never grow tired, because [...] there are realistic portraits of many notable men of our times."&lt;ref name="Schroth2"&gt;S. Schroth, "Burial of the Count of Orgaz", 2&lt;/ref&gt;

==Analysis of the painting==
[[File:El Greco - Count Orgasz - face.jpg|thumb|Detail of the painting.]]
According to the terms stipulated in the contract and the prevailing scholarly approach, the painting is divided into two zones, juxtaposing the earthly with the heavenly world, which are brought together compositionally (e.g., by the standing figures, by their varied participation in the earthly and heavenly event, by the torches, cross etc.).&lt;ref name="BrL"&gt;M. Lambraki-Plaka, ''A Tribute to El Greco'', 76&lt;br /&gt;* S. Schroth, "Burial of the Count of Orgaz", 7&lt;br /&gt; * {{cite encyclopedia|title=Greco, El|encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica|last=H. Wethey}}&lt;/ref&gt; Franz Philipp emphasizes on the element of the assumption of the soul (''assumptio animae''), and argues that the work should be considered as tripartite: the central division of the painting is occupied by the ''assumptio animae'', in the form of a newborn, "ethereal" baby.&lt;ref&gt;F. Philipp, "El Greco's Entombment", 78–82&lt;/ref&gt; Augustine's perception of the soul and its ascent, which evolved from a [[Neoplatonism and Christianity|Neoplatonic basis]], is a possible inspiration for the painter's imagery of ''assumptio animae''.&lt;ref name="D70"&gt;D. Davies, "El Greco &amp; the Reform Movements in Spain", 70&lt;/ref&gt;  Greco's way of thematically and artistically linking the upper with the lower zone of the painting has been characterized by art scholars as ingenuous, and as further accomplishing the main message of the painting, that veneration and good works lead to [[Salvation in Christianity|
salvation]].&lt;ref name="Schroth79"&gt;S. Schroth, "Burial of the Count of Orgaz", 7, 9&lt;/ref&gt;

In the upper part, the heavenly one, the clouds have parted to receive the "righteous man" in [[Paradise]]. Heaven is evoked by swirling icy clouds, semiabstract in their shape, and the saints are tall and phantomlike. [[Depiction of Jesus|Christ]], clad in white and in glory, is a radiance of light, and the crowning point of the triangle formed by the figures of the [[The Madonna|Madonna]] and [[Saint John the Baptist]] in the traditional [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] composition of the [[Deesis]].&lt;ref name="Plaka55"&gt;M. Lambraki-Plaka, ''El Greco-The Greek'', 55&lt;br /&gt;* D. Davies, "El Greco &amp; the Reform Movements in Spain", 70&lt;br /&gt;* S. Schroth, "Burial of the Count of Orgaz", 9&lt;/ref&gt; These three central figures of heavenly glory are surrounded by apostles, martyrs, Biblical figures (including [[Moses]], [[Noah]] and [[David]]) as well as [[Philip II of Spain]], though he was still alive. The "righteous" Philip II is spiritually united with Christ and the heavenly creatures in a [[The City of God|City of God]] as conceived by Augustine.&lt;ref name="D70" /&gt; In the central part of the composition, an angel powerfully pushes the nascent soul upwards, a movement interpreted once again as a visualization of the Counter-Reformation teaching of salvation.&lt;ref&gt;E.A. Maré, "The Being and Movement of the Angel", ''passim''&lt;/ref&gt;

The scene of the miracle is depicted in the lower part of the composition, in the terrestrial section, where all is normal as regards the scale and proportions of the figures.&lt;ref name="Plaka55" /&gt; Saint Augustine, bearing the characteristics of [[Gaspar de Quiroga y Vela]], the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Toledo|Archbishop of Toledo]], and Saint Stephen, in golden and red vestments respectively, bend reverently over the body of the count, who is clad in magnificent armor that reflects the yellow and reds of the other figures. The armor is contemporary with Greco's time, and inspired by the ceremonial military dress of the Spanish royals as depicted in [[Titian]]'s portraits.&lt;ref&gt;M. Lambraki-Plaka, ''A Tribute to El Greco'', 76, 78&lt;/ref&gt; The noblemen contemplate the event in a detached and restrained manner. Their subdued composure has been interpreted either as another visual element of the didactic purpose of the painting under the Counter-Reformation influence or as an expression of the [[Byzantine art|Byzantine origins]] of Greco's art.&lt;ref name="Plaka767"&gt;M. Lambraki-Plaka, ''A Tribute to El Greco'', 76&lt;br /&gt;* S. Schroth, "Burial of the Count of Orgaz", 7&lt;/ref&gt; The young boy at the left is El Greco's son, Jorge Manuel; on a handkerchief in his pocket is inscribed the artist's signature and the date 1578, the year of the boy's birth. Jorge Manuel's inclusion emphasizes the didactic purpose of the painting: the boy occupies a prominent position close to the spectator's view, directing the latter with his pointing finger.&lt;ref name="Schroth3"&gt;S. Schroth, "Burial of the Count of Orgaz", 3&lt;/ref&gt; The artist himself can be recognised directly above the raised hand of a knight of the [[Order of Santiago]].&lt;ref&gt;M. Lambraki-Plaka, ''A Tribute to El Greco'', 78&lt;br /&gt;* [[Web Gallery of Art]], [http://www.wga.hu/frames-e.html?/html/g/greco_el/09/index.html The Burial of the Count of Orgaz]&lt;/ref&gt;

The painting has a chromatic harmony that is incredibly rich, expressive and radiant. On the black mourning garments of the nobles are projected the gold-embroidered vestments, thus creating an intense ceremonial character. In the heavenly space there is a predominance of transparent harmonies of iridescence and ivoried greys, which harmonize with the gilded ochres, while in the Madonna's maforium (mantle) deep blue is closely combined with bright red. The rhetoric of the expressions, the glances and the gestural translation make the scene very moving.&lt;ref name="Plaka55-56"&gt;M. Lambraki-Plaka, ''El Greco-The Greek'', 55–56&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influences==
[[File:Dormition El Greco.jpg|thumb|left|''[[The Dormition of the Virgin]]''. The ''Dormition'' was suggested as the compositional model for ''The Burial of the Count of Orgaz''.]]

The composition of the painting has been closely related to the Byzantine [[iconography]] of the [[Dormition of the Mother of God]]. The argumentation supporting this point of view focuses on the icon of the ''[[Dormition of the Virgin (El Greco)|Dormition]]'' by El Greco that was discovered in 1983 in the church of the same name in [[Syros]].&lt;ref name="Plaka55" /&gt; Robert Byron, according to whom the iconographic type of the ''Dormition'' was the compositional model for ''The Burial of the Count of Orgaz'', asserts that El Greco as a genuine Byzantine painter worked throughout his life with a repertoire of components and motifs at will, depending on the narrative and expressive requirements of the art.&lt;ref name="Byron160"&gt;R. Byron, ''Greco: The Epilogue to Byzantine Culture'', 160–174&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, [[Harold Wethey]] rejects as "unconvincing" the view that the composition of the ''Burial'' is derived from the ''Dormition'', "since the work is more immediately related to Italian Renaissance prototypes". In connection with its elimination of spatial depth by compressing figures into the foreground, the early Florentine Mannerists—[[Rosso Fiorentino]], [[Pontormo]] and [[Parmigianino]]—are mentioned, as well two paintings by [[Tintoretto]]: the ''Crucifixion'' and the ''Resurrection of Lazarus'', the latter because of the horizontal row of spectators behind the miracle. The elliptical grouping of the two saints, as they lower the dead body, is said to be closer to Titian's early ''[[The Entombment of Christ (Titian)|Entombment]]'' than to any other work. Wethey asserts that "El Greco's Mannerist method of composition is nowhere more clearly expressed than here, where all of the action takes place in the frontal plane".&lt;ref&gt;H.E. Wethey, ''El Greco and his School'', II, 56, 80, and 97&lt;br /&gt;* {{cite encyclopedia|title=Greco, El|encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica|last=H.E. Wethey}}&lt;br /&gt;* F. Philipp, "El Greco's Entombment", 76&lt;br /&gt;* S. Schroth, "Burial of the Count of Orgaz", 7&lt;/ref&gt;

Philipp argues that the painting is heavily influenced by the contemporary Spanish [[funerary art]], and that Greco adhered to this sepulchrar artistic tradition while adapting a popular religious subject, the [[Burial of Jesus|Entombment of Christ]], to the needs of his assignment.&lt;ref&gt;F. Philipp, "El Greco's Entombment", ''passim''.&lt;/ref&gt; Sarah Schroth believes that Titian's ''Entombment'' is used by Greco as a model to subtly pass his didactic message for the value of good works, and she mentions [[Albrecht Dürer]]'s ''[[Adoration of the Trinity]]'' as an inspiration for the painting's bi-partite composition and the depiction of contemporary laymen in the lower, earthly zone.&lt;ref name="Schroth79" /&gt; However, Scroth departs from Wethey's absolute rejection of the presence of Byzantine elements in the painting, and accepts ''Dormition'' as an influence for the ''Burial'' 's depiction of the ''assumptio animae''. A third work of Tintoretto, ''The Last Judgment'', is mentioned by Schroth as a possible influence for the ''Burial'' 's depiction of Gloria, since Greco wanted to incorporate elements of the funeral liturgy in the upper part of the painting.&lt;ref name="Schroth"&gt;S. Schroth, "Burial of the Count of Orgaz", 13–14&lt;/ref&gt;

==Assessments==
Regardless of their different approaches in relation to the painting's influences, the ''Burial'' is unanimously celebrated by art scholars as a masterpiece. It is also regarded as the first completely personal work of the artist, the culmination of his first ten years of creativity in Toledo, initiating his mature artistic period, as well as the processes of spiritualization and dematerialization, which will continue in his later works.&lt;ref&gt;M. Lambraki-Plaka, ''A Tribute to El Greco'', 81&lt;br /&gt;* [[Web Gallery of Art]], [http://www.wga.hu/frames-e.html?/html/g/greco_el/09/index.html The Burial of the Count of Orgaz]&lt;/ref&gt; According to Lambraki-Plaka, the ''Burial'' is a landmark in the artist's career: "This is where El Greco sets before us, in a highly compressed form the wisdom he has brought to his art, his knowledge, his expertise, his composite imagination and his expressive power. It is the living encyclopedia of his art without ceasing to be a masterpiece with organic continuity and entelechy".&lt;ref name="Plaka55-56" /&gt;

The impressive depiction of prominent members of the Toledan society in the lower zone establishes Greco as an accomplished [[portrait]]ist, with a profound knowledge of physiognomy and gestures. The chromatic harmony and the use of incredibly rich, expressive and radiant colors confirm his talent as a colorist, while the scenes depicted on the embroidered vestments reveal a gifted [[miniature art|miniaturist]]. The overall composition with the innovative elements already mentioned—the peculiar synthesis of the real with the surreal, the negation of spacial depth and the impressive array of portraits—unveil all aspects of Greco's extraordinary art.&lt;ref&gt;M. Lambraki-Plaka, ''A Tribute to El Greco'', 81&lt;br /&gt;* [[Web Gallery of Art]], [http://www.wga.hu/frames-e.html?/html/g/greco_el/09/index.html The Burial of the Count of Orgaz]&lt;br /&gt;* {{cite encyclopedia|title=Greco, El|encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica|last=H.E. Wethey}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Interpreting the remark of Francisco de Pisa in relation to the painting, that "there are always new things to contemplate in it", Schroth characterizes the ''Burial'' as an "inexhaustible source of instruction as well as pleasure".&lt;ref name="Schroth14"&gt;S. Schroth, "Burial of the Count of Orgaz", 14&lt;/ref&gt;

In his travel diaries of the Far East, [[Mandatory Palestine|Palestine]] and Spain, [[Albert Einstein]] characterizes ''Burial'' as "a magnificent painting" and "among the profoundest images I have ever seen."&lt;ref&gt;A. Einstein – Z. Rosenkranz, ''The Travel Diaries of Albert Einstein'', 237&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The F-Word''''' is a book by lexicographer and linguist [[Jesse Sheidlower]] surveying the history and usage of the English word ''[[fuck]]'' and a wide variety of [[euphemism]]s that replace it. Sheidlower examines 16th and 17th century poetry, 20th century literature, and 21st century media uses of the word.

The book was first published in 1995 by [[Random House]], which also published the second edition in 1999. [[Oxford University Press]] published a revised and expanded third edition in 2009, featuring a foreword by comedian [[Lewis Black]].

"'''The Gift'''" is the [[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (season 5)|fifth season]] finale, and the 100th episode, of the fantasy-horror television series ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (TV series)|Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]'' (1997-2003). The episode serves as the "WB Finale" of the series, as it moved to the [[UPN]] channel for the remainder of the series.

The premise of ''Buffy the Vampire Slayer'' is that an adolescent girl, [[Buffy Summers]], is chosen by mystical forces and given superhuman powers to kill vampires, demons, and other evil creatures in the fictional town of [[Sunnydale]]. She is supported by a close circle of family and friends, nicknamed the [[Scooby Gang (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Scooby Gang]]. In "The Gift", Buffy refuses to accept that her sister Dawn's death is the only way to defeat the hell-god [[Glory (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Glory]] and prepares to do battle. In the end, she discovers the meaning of her "gift".

==Plot==
The [[Scooby Gang (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Scooby Gang]] considers plans to foil [[Glory (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Glory]], but can only suggest killing [[Buffy Summers|Buffy]]'s sister [[Dawn Summers|Dawn]] before Glory uses her in the ritual, which Buffy refuses to consider. [[Anya Jenkins|Anya]] suggests using [[No Place Like Home (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|the Dagon Sphere]], which repels and confuses Glory, and the hammer of [[Triangle (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Olaf the troll]]. They hope to delay Glory until her deadline for completing the ritual has passed, preventing an apocalypse and making Dawn useless to her.

As Buffy trains with Giles, she reveals to him that the First Slayer told her, on her vision quest (in "[[Intervention (Buffy episode)|Intervention]]"), that death was her gift, an idea she rejects. Buffy also notes that while she survived killing [[Angel (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Angel]] despite loving him, losing Dawn will destroy her. Xander proposes to Anya.

Buffy and [[Spike (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Spike]] gather weapons. She asks him to protect Dawn. Spike tells Buffy he knows she'll never love him, but is grateful that she treats him like a man rather than a monster. Glory's minions build a tower for the ritual to open the gates between dimensions.

Buffy and her allies confront Glory just as the ritual is to begin. [[Willow Rosenberg|Willow]] launches a magic attack, confusing and dazing Glory, while restoring Tara's sanity. Buffy attacks Glory with the Dagon sphere, but Glory manages to destroy it. As they fight Glory punches off her head, revealing she is actually fighting [[Buffybot|Buffy's robot double]]. Buffy surprises Glory by attacking her with Olaf's Hammer, and then races to save Dawn, but Glory slows her down as they battle on the tower. The two of them fall to the ground below and Xander uses a crane to hit Glory with a wrecking ball. Buffy beats Glory with the hammer until she reverts to Ben, but spares his life, telling him that Glory must never return or they will both die. With the others' attention diverted, Giles kills Ben by suffocating him, to prevent Glory's re-emergence.

With the window of time to stop the ritual about to close, the Scoobies spot someone up on the scaffolding with Dawn. Willow telepathically tells Spike to go up to Dawn, and she and Tara magically clear a path for him by throwing aside Glory's minions and guards. Spike finds Doc the demon threatening to start the ritual. A fight ensues, but Doc tosses Spike off the scaffolding and then cuts into Dawn with shallow cuts, starting the apocalyptic ritual. Buffy reaches the top, kills Doc and frees the captive Dawn just as the portal between dimensions opens. Dawn is willing to sacrifice herself to seal the portal, but Buffy, realizing the true meaning of the First Slayer's revelation, stops her. Buffy throws herself into the portal, which closes when she dies. She is buried with the epitaph, "She saved the world. A lot."

==Themes==
In an essay on the ownership of evil, Erma Petrova argues that Giles murdering Ben is comparable to Willow murdering Warren (in "[[Villains (Buffy episode)|Villains]]")- both victims are human, and their deaths are necessary to prevent further suffering. Although the moral ambiguity of killing Ben is discussed earlier in the episode, as well as Ben's innocence ("I know he's an innocent, but...not like 'Dawn' innocent"), Giles is never shown to have feelings of guilt afterwards; he did what needed to be done. Contrast this with Willow's guilt over murdering Warren in a spirit of revenge, a theme that persists until the end of the series. Petrova feels the difference for Giles is that killing Ben is his only option - the police wouldn't understand the danger, Buffy is morally unable to take a human life, and leaving him alive presents too great a risk. Willow, however, had other options available and yet chose to murder Warren anyway.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

Giles recognizes that Buffy, as a hero, lives by a more demanding moral code than most people. Her unique role and abilities confer special responsibilities, including moral rules by which Giles is not bound.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

==Cultural References==
*In response to Buffy's declaration that she'll kill anyone who tries to hurt Dawn, Spike says, "Well, not exactly the [[St Crispin's Day Speech|Saint Crispin's Day speech]], was it?" To which Giles replies, "We few, we happy few--" and Spike finishes, "we band of buggered." The original line is, "We few, we happy few, we band of brothers."

==Continuity==
*Xander exclaims that smart chicks are hot and Willow asks, "You couldn't have figured that out in the tenth grade?" This is a reference to the crush Willow had on Xander during Seasons 1 and 2. Her feelings are unrequited until [[Homecoming (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Season 3]].
*On her way out of the magic shop, Tara points to Giles and says, "you're a killer" foreshadowing that Giles will kill Ben.

===Arc Significance===
* Buffy dies a second time; the first was in "[[Prophecy Girl]]". She will joke about this in "[[Once More, with Feeling (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Once More, with Feeling]]".
* Spike is invited back into Buffy's home after being banned in "[[Crush (Buffy episode)|Crush]]". He will not be disinvited again, even after his attack on Buffy in season six.
* Spike also says to Buffy while they are getting weapons, "I always knew I would go down fighting" which foreshadows his death to save the world in season seven.
* Spike's statement to Buffy on the staircase that she will never love him mirrors his last words to her in "[[Chosen (Buffy episode)|Chosen]]".
* Crossover with ''Angel'': in "[[I Will Remember You (Angel)|I Will Remember You]]", the Oracles told [[Angel (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Angel]] that Buffy would die. Additionally, in an instance of [[foreshadowing]] in the episode "[[Who Are You (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Who Are You]]", if you look closer at Joyce's credit card, it expires in May 2001–the month Buffy dies in "The Gift" (aired May 22, 2001). Faith (in Buffy's body) also words this expiration date while buying a plane ticket on the phone.
* Crossover with ''Angel'': In the final scene of "[[There's No Place Like Plrtz Glrb]]", Willow goes to Los Angeles to tell [[Angel (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Angel]] and his [[Angel Investigations|crew]] that Buffy is dead.
* The Key ceases to be significant; as Dawn says in [[Bargaining (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|the next episode]], "I'm not the Key. Or if I am, I don't open anything anymore." In "[[Storyteller (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Storyteller]]", [[Andrew Wells]] says, "Dawn used to be a key. I don't really know what that means."
* Glory is defeated and dies, ending her reign as the "[[Big Bad]]" of season five. Her death allows the [[First Evil]] to take her form, as seen in the seventh season premiere episode "[[Lessons (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Lessons]]." 
* Giles commits murder for the first time when he kills Glory while she is in the form of Ben, suffocating him. Giles has never directly taken a human life (with the exception of accidentally causing the death of a friend when he and a group of Wiccans summoned the demon Eyghon, which is revealed in Season Two). Before he kills him, Giles explains to Ben that Buffy could never bring herself to kill a human, a statement which directly contradicts the events in [[Spiral (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|"Spiral"]], when Buffy kills several Knights of Byzantium, who are human, albeit in defense of herself and the gang. He most likely meant Buffy could never commit a murder since the knights she killed were in self-defense.

[[File:VidaDeLuisCarlosPrestes.jpg|thumb|First edition&lt;br&gt;(publ. Livraria Martins Editora)]]

'''''The Knight of Hope''''' or '''''The Life of Luis Carlos Prestes''''' ([[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]: '''''O cavaleiro da esperanca''''' or '''''Vida de Luis Carlos Prestes''''') is a 1942 book by [[Jorge Amado]], a [[biography]] of the well-known [[Brazil]]ian [[revolutionary]] [[Luis Carlos Prestes]]. It has not been published in English.

''The Knight of Hope'' salutes the heroism of Prestes. In 1924 he set out on a 25,000 kilometer march that became known as the [[Coluna Prestes|Prestes Column]]. In 1935 he founded the National Liberation Alliance and led the so-called "Communist Conspiracy". He was imprisoned in 1936 by the [[Getúlio Vargas]] dictatorship, along with his pregnant wife. The book expresses considerable support for Prestes's positions and indeed admiration for his person. As Amado observed, the book was written “with passion, about someone who is loved”. &lt;ref name= "Amado.com"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Knight of Hope |url=http://www.jorgeamado.com.br/obra.php3?codigo=12614&amp;ordena=1|website=JorgeAmado.com|publisher=Companhia das Letras|accessdate=30 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, one critic has argued that Amado’s estimate of the significance of Prestes is somewhat exaggerated, while admitting that the biography "is useful testimony to the relation between art and political life". &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ellison|first1=Fred P.|title=Brazil's New Novel|date=1954|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley and Los Angeles|page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Amado himself suffered censorship and political persecution under Brazil’s  [[Vargas Era|Estado Novo]] regime (1937-45). He was imprisoned in both 1936 and 1937, accused of being a Communist and a subversive. In 1937, copies of his various works were burned in a public square in Salvador along with those of others. He decided to write Prestes’ biography in 1941 to campaign for the release of the revolutionary leader, who was still in prison. The book was written in Buenos Aires and published in Spanish in Argentina in 1942. Copies were only available on the black market in Brazil, and the text circulated in secret. The Argentine edition was later banned.     

The first Brazilian edition was published in 1945, but disappeared from bookstores after the [[1964 Brazilian coup d'état|military coup of 1964]]. The next edition was not published until 1979. Throughout the biography Jorge Amado addresses an imaginary female reader, showing his intention to speak directly to the Brazilian people, encouraging them to support democracy and liberty. &lt;ref name= "Amado.com" /&gt;

'''The Sydney Camera Circle''' was a [[Pictorialism|Pictorialist]] photographic society formed in 1916 in [[Sydney]], [[Australia]]. It was most active before World War II, and was influential on Australian photography for fifty years.

==History==

The Sydney Camera Circle was formed on 28 November 1916 at the Bostock-Little Studio, Phillip Street, Sydney. The founders were [[Cecil Bostock]], [[Harold Cazneaux]], Malcolm McKinnon, James Paton, [[James S. Stening]] and William Stewart White. All six signed a [[manifesto]], pledging to advance and promote a Pictorialist photography devoted to Australian sunlight and shadow as opposed to the greys and ‘dismal’ shadows of European styles.&lt;ref&gt;Harold Cazneaux letter to Jack Cato, National Library of Australia Manuscript MS 5416&lt;/ref&gt; In this ambition they shared the ideals of the [[Heidelberg School]] of Australian painters. The group was dominated by [[Amateur|amateurs]] interested in photography as an art form who shared constructive criticism and support at their meetings, exhibiting their work under the name of The Sydney Camera Circle.

The group continued as an entity until 1978 when membership was dwindling in competition with that of the Australian Photographic Society and the Camera Club of Sydney.

==Selected Exhibitions==

* 14 to 28 February 1921: at the invitation of [[Henri Mallard]], 115 prints were displayed at the Kodak Salon, Sydney with sales totaling £70.&lt;ref&gt;Harringtons Photographic Journal, Tuesday 1 March 1921 Page 22:
"In an exhibition of photographs opened on the 24th February at the Kodak Salon, George Street, Sydney, there are many examples of discerning selection of subject and artistic treatment in reproduction. The whole of the work is by members of the Sydney Camera Circle and includes quite a number of pictures that had been sent for exhibition to London. In pictorial photography the greatest success is achieved in the realm of repose - in capturing glimpses of city or countryside, revealing some of the more restful moments of the passing hour. Some very striking examples of artistic fidelity in this direction are to be seen at the exhibition. The pictures cover a wide field, including photographs of sea and sky, of trees, of shipping, of crowded streets, of almost deserted thoroughfares and so on. Of all these, perhaps, those photographs in which trees form a dominant part of the composition are the most satisfying to the artistic sense. "Sentinels of the Wood" and "Cameo" by Mr J.E. Paton and Mr W.S. White, are exquisite examples of what the artist photographer may accomplish. "Flower Sellers" by Mr C.W. Bostock - a picture which was reproduced in these pages some months ago - is well deserving of contemplation by amateurs, who so often are vexed by the difficulties of strong sunlight and deep shadows. It is a masterly piece of work. Among the pictures of pastoral life, one of stockmen watering their horses at a creek is a happy representation of a typical outback scene. The exhibitors are Messrs. C.W. Bostock, Chas. Wakeford, J.E. Paton, W.S. White, D.J. Webster, Monte Luke, H. Mallard, Arthur Ford, E.N. Poole, C. Laseron and Stanley William Eutrope."&lt;/ref&gt;
* February 1921: Scottish Photographic Federation Salon, Dundee included 60 prints from The Sydney Camera Circle.
* July 1921: London Salon shows 9 prints by 8 members of the Circle.
* October 1921:  Melbourne Arts and Crafts exhibition shows 50 photographs by the members. Kodak Melbourne shows the work in their windows.
* 1922: Colonial Competition 1922. Sydney Camera Circle takes first place with medals awarded to Henri Mallard and Florence Milson by the Amateur Photographer and Photography.
* 12 June to 8 July 1979: [[Art Gallery of New South Wales]] 'Australian Pictorial Photography', S.H. Ervin Gallery, Sydney.
* 14 January to 1 April 1984 Art Gallery of NSW 'The Sydney Camera Circle: The Early Years, 1916 - 1938'.

== History ==

The formula was defined by Jeff Tupper and appears as an example in Tupper's 2001 [[SIGGRAPH]] paper on reliable two-dimensional computer graphing algorithms.
&lt;ref&gt;* [http://www.dgp.toronto.edu/people/mooncake/papers/SIGGRAPH2001_Tupper.pdf Tupper, Jeff. "Reliable Two-Dimensional Graphing Methods for Mathematical Formulae with Two Free Variables"]&lt;/ref&gt; This paper discusses methods related to the GrafEq formula-graphing program developed by Tupper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.peda.com/grafeq/|title=Pedagoguery Software: GrafEq|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Although the formula is called "[[self-reference|self-referential]]", Tupper did not name it as such.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Narayanan |first1=Arvind |title=Tupper’s Self-Referential Formula Debunked |url=http://arvindn.livejournal.com/132943.html |accessdate=20 February 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150424181239/http://arvindn.livejournal.com/132943.html |archivedate=24 April 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Formula ==

The formula is an [[inequality (mathematics)|inequality]] defined as:

: &lt;math&gt;{1\over 2} &lt; \left\lfloor \mathrm{mod}\left(\left\lfloor {y \over 17} \right\rfloor 2^{-17 \lfloor x \rfloor - \mathrm{mod}(\lfloor y\rfloor, 17)},2\right)\right\rfloor&lt;/math&gt;
or, as plaintext,
{{quotation|1/2 &lt; floor(mod(floor(y/17)*2^(-17*floor(x)-mod(floor(y), 17)),2))}}

where ⌊&amp;nbsp;⌋ denotes the [[Floor and ceiling functions|floor function]], and mod is the [[modulo operation]].

Let ''k'' equal the following 543-digit integer:

If one [[Graph of a function|graphs]] the set of points (''x'',&amp;nbsp;''y'') in 0&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;''x''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;106 and ''k''&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;''y''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''k''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;17 satisfying the inequality given above, the resulting graph looks like this (the axes in this plot have been reversed, otherwise the picture would be upside-down and mirrored):

The formula is a general-purpose method of decoding a bitmap stored in the constant&amp;nbsp;''k'', and it could actually be used to draw any other image.  When applied to the unbounded positive range 0&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;''y'', the formula tiles a vertical swath of the plane with a pattern that contains all possible 17-pixel-tall bitmaps.  One horizontal slice of that infinite bitmap depicts the drawing formula itself, but this is not remarkable, since other slices depict all other possible formulae that might fit in a 17-pixel-tall bitmap. Tupper has created extended versions of his original formula that rule out all but one slice.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.peda.com/selfplot/selfplot3big.png&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.peda.com/selfplot/selfplot2.png&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.peda.com/selfplot/selfplot.png&lt;/ref&gt;

The constant ''k'' is a simple [[1-bit color|monochrome]] [[bitmap|bitmap image]] of the formula treated as a binary number and multiplied by 17.  If ''k'' is divided by 17, the [[least significant bit]] encodes the upper-right corner (''k'',&amp;nbsp;0); the 17 least significant bits encode the rightmost column of pixels; the next 17 least significant bits encode the 2nd-rightmost column, and so on.
