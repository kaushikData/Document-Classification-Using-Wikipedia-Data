[[File:Sisyphus by von Stuck.jpg|thumb|300px|right|[[Sisyphus]], the symbol of the absurdity of existence, painting by [[Franz Stuck]] (1920)]]

&lt;!-- Do not edit the definition of Absurdism without first discussing on the Talk page - thank you for helping to maintain a neutral point of view --&gt;

In [[philosophy]], "'''the Absurd'''" refers to the conflict between the human tendency to seek [[Intrinsic value (ethics)|inherent value]] and [[meaning of life|meaning in life]] and the human inability to find any in a purposeless, meaningless or chaotic and irrational universe.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}} The universe and the human mind do not each separately cause the Absurd, but rather, the Absurd arises by the contradictory nature of the two existing simultaneously. 

As a philosophy, '''absurdism''' furthermore explores the fundamental nature of the Absurd and how individuals, once becoming conscious of the Absurd, should respond to it. The absurdist philosopher [[Albert Camus]] stated that individuals should embrace the absurd condition of human existence while also defiantly continuing to explore and search for meaning.&lt;ref name="CamusMyth"&gt;{{cite book|last=Camus|first=Albert|authorlink=Albert Camus|title=Myth of Sisyphus and Other Essays|publisher=Vintage Books|isbn=0-679-73373-6|year=1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Absurdism shares some concepts, and a common theoretical template, with [[existentialism]] and [[nihilism]]. It has its origins in the work of the 19th-century [[Denmark|Danish]] philosopher [[Søren Kierkegaard]], who chose to confront the crisis that humans face with the Absurd by developing his own [[Philosophy of Søren Kierkegaard|existentialist philosophy]].&lt;ref name="Kierkegaard"&gt;Stewart, Jon (2011). Kierkegaard and Existentialism. Farnham, England: Ashgate. {{ISBN|978-1-4094-2641-7}}. pp. 76–78.&lt;/ref&gt; Absurdism as a belief system was born of the European existentialist movement that ensued, specifically when Camus rejected certain aspects of that philosophical line of thought&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Solomon |first=Robert C. |authorlink=Robert C. Solomon |title=From Rationalism to Existentialism: The Existentialists and Their Nineteenth Century Backgrounds |publisher=[[Rowman and Littlefield]] |year=2001 |page=245 |isbn=0-7425-1241-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; and published his essay ''[[The Myth of Sisyphus]]''. The aftermath of [[World War II]] provided the social environment that stimulated absurdist views and allowed for their popular development, especially in the devastated country of [[France]].

{{Also|Existentialism#The Absurd}}
In absurdist philosophy, the Absurd arises out of the fundamental disharmony between the individual's search for meaning and the [[meaning (existential)|meaninglessness]] of the universe. As beings looking for meaning in a meaningless world, humans have three ways of resolving the dilemma. Kierkegaard and Camus describe the solutions in their works, ''[[The Sickness Unto Death]]'' (1849) and ''[[The Myth of Sisyphus]]'' (1942), respectively:

*[[Suicide]] (or, "escaping existence"): a solution in which a person ends one's own life. Both Kierkegaard and Camus dismiss the viability of this option. Camus states that it does not counter the Absurd. Rather, in the act of ending one's existence, one's existence only becomes more absurd.
*[[Religious]], [[spirtuality|spiritual]], or abstract belief in a [[Transcendence (philosophy)|transcendent]] realm, being, or idea: a solution in which one believes in the existence of a reality that is beyond the Absurd, and, as such, has meaning. Kierkegaard stated that a belief in anything beyond the Absurd requires an irrational but perhaps necessary religious "leap" into the intangible and empirically unprovable (now commonly referred to as a "[[leap of faith]]"). However, Camus regarded this solution, and others, as "philosophical suicide".
*Acceptance of the Absurd: a solution in which one accepts the Absurd and continues to live in spite of it. Camus endorsed this solution, believing that by accepting the Absurd, one can achieve the greatest extent of one's freedom. By recognizing no religious or other moral constraints, and by revolting against the Absurd (through meaning-making) while simultaneously accepting it as unstoppable, one could find contentment through the transient personal meaning constructed in the process. Kierkegaard, on the other hand, regarded this solution as "demoniac madness": "''He rages most of all at the thought that eternity might get it into its head to take his misery from him!''"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kierkegaard|first=Søren|authorlink=Søren Kierkegaard|title=The Sickness Unto Death|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=1941}} Part I, Ch. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relationship to existentialism and nihilism==
Absurdism originated from (as well as alongside) the 20th-century strains of [[existentialism]] and [[nihilism]]; it shares some prominent starting points with both, though also entails conclusions that are uniquely distinct from these other schools of thought. All three arose from the human experience of anguish and confusion stemming from the Absurd: the apparent meaninglessness in a world in which humans, nevertheless, are compelled to find or create meaning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/nihilism/#H3 |title=Nihilism |author=Alan Pratt |date=April 23, 2001 |work=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy |publisher=[[Embry-Riddle University]] |accessdate=February 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The three schools of thought diverge from there. Existentialists have generally advocated the individual's construction of his or her own meaning in life as well as the [[free will]] of the individual. Nihilists, on the contrary, contend that "it is futile to seek or to affirm meaning where none can be found."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=9VnPgFiW0CIC&amp;oi |title=The Specter of the Absurd: Sources and Criticisms of Modern Nihilism |author=Donald A. Crosby |date=July 1, 1988 |publisher=State University of New York Press |accessdate=January 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Absurdists, following Camus's formulation, hesitantly allow the possibility for some meaning or value in life, but are neither as certain as existentialists are about the value of one's own constructed meaning nor as nihilists are about the total inability to create meaning. Absurdists following Camus also devalue or outright reject free will, encouraging merely that the individual live defiantly and authentically ''in spite of'' the psychological tension of the Absurd.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Albert Camus|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/camus/|publisher=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|quote=What is the Camusean alternative to suicide or hope? The answer is to live without escape and with integrity, in “revolt” and defiance, maintaining the tension intrinsic to human life}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Camus himself passionately worked to counter [[nihilism]], as he explained in his essay "[[The Rebel (book)|The Rebel]]," while he also categorically rejected the label of "existentialist" in his essay "Enigma" and in the compilation ''The Lyrical and Critical Essays of Albert Camus'', though he was, and still is, often broadly characterized by others as an existentialist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Solomon|first=Robert C. |authorlink=Robert C. Solomon|title=From Rationalism to Existentialism: The Existentialists and Their Nineteenth Century Backgrounds |publisher=[[Rowman and Littlefield]] |year=2001 |page=245 |isbn=0-7425-1241-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both existentialism and absurdism entail consideration of the practical applications of becoming conscious of the truth of [[existential nihilism]]: i.e., how a driven seeker of meaning should act when suddenly confronted with the seeming concealment, or downright absence, of meaning in the universe. Camus's own understanding of the world (e.g., "a benign indifference", in ''[[The Stranger (Camus novel)|The Stranger]]''), and every vision he had for its progress,{{example needed|date=November 2018}} however, sets him apart from the general existentialist trend.

Such a chart represents some of the overlap and tensions between existentialist and absurdist approaches to meaning.  While absurdism can be seen as a kind of response to existentialism, it can be debated exactly how substantively the two positions differ from each other.  The existentialist, after all, doesn't deny the reality of death.  But the absurdist seems to reaffirm the way in which death ultimately nullifies our meaning-making activities, a conclusion the existentialists seem to resist through various notions of posterity or, in Sartre's case, participation in a grand humanist project.

==Søren Kierkegaard==
{{Main|Philosophy of Søren Kierkegaard}}
[[Image:Kierkegaard.jpg|thumb|Kierkegaard designed the relationship framework based (in part) on how a person reacts to [[existential despair|despair]]. Absurdist philosophy fits into the 'despair of defiance' rubric.&lt;ref&gt;Kierkegaard, Søren. ''The Sickness Unto Death''. ''Kierkegaard wrote about all four viewpoints in his works at one time or another, but the majority of his work leaned towards what would later become absurdist and theistic existentialist views.''&lt;/ref&gt;]]
A century before [[Albert Camus|Camus]], the 19th century Danish philosopher [[Søren Kierkegaard]] wrote extensively about the absurdity of the world. In his journals, Kierkegaard writes about the absurd:

{{quotation|What is the Absurd? It is, as may quite easily be seen, that I, a rational being, must act in a case where my reason, my powers of reflection, tell me: you can just as well do the one thing as the other, that is to say where my reason and reflection say: you cannot act and yet here is where I have to act... The Absurd, or to act by virtue of the absurd, is to act upon faith ... I must act, but reflection has closed the road so I take one of the possibilities and say: This is what I do, I cannot do otherwise because I am brought to a standstill by my powers of reflection.&lt;ref&gt;Dru, Alexander. ''The Journals of Søren Kierkegaard'', [[Oxford University Press]], 1938.&lt;/ref&gt;|Kierkegaard, Søren|Journals|1849}}

Here is another example of the Absurd from his writings: {{Quotation|What, then, is the absurd? The absurd is that the eternal truth has come into existence in time, that God has come into existence, has been born, has grown up. etc., has come into existence exactly as an individual human being, indistinguishable from any other human being, in as much as all immediate recognizability is pre-Socratic paganism and from the Jewish point of view is idolatry.&lt;br&gt;—Kierkegaard, ''Concluding Unscientific Postscript'', 1846, Hong 1992, p. 210}}

How can this absurdity be held or believed? Kierkegaard says: {{Quotation|I gladly undertake, by way of brief repetition, to emphasize what other pseudonyms have emphasized. The absurd is not the absurd or absurdities without any distinction (wherefore Johannes de Silentio: "How many of our age understand what the absurd is?"). The absurd is a category, and the most developed thought is required to define the Christian absurd accurately and with conceptual correctness. The absurd is a category, the negative criterion, of the divine or of the relationship to the divine. When the believer has faith, the absurd is not the absurd — faith transforms it, but in every weak moment it is again more or less absurd to him. The passion of faith is the only thing which masters the absurd — if not, then faith is not faith in the strictest sense, but a kind of knowledge. The absurd terminates negatively before the sphere of faith, which is a sphere by itself. To a third person the believer relates himself by virtue of the absurd; so must a third person judge, for a third person does not have the passion of faith. Johannes de Silentio has never claimed to be a believer; just the opposite, he has explained that he is not a believer — in order to illuminate faith negatively.&lt;br&gt;—''Journals of Søren Kierkegaard'' X6B 79&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=Naturalthinker.com|title=Søren Kierkegaard|url=http://www.naturalthinker.net/trl/texts/Kierkegaard,Soren/JournPapers/X_6_B.html|accessdate=2016-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Kierkegaard provides an example in ''[[Fear and Trembling]]'' (1843), which was published under the pseudonym ''[[Johannes de Silentio]]''. In the story of [[Abraham]] in the Book of [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]], Abraham is told by [[God]] to [[Binding of Isaac|kill his son]] [[Isaac]]. Just as Abraham is about to kill Isaac, an angel stops Abraham from doing so. Kierkegaard believes that through virtue of the absurd, Abraham, defying all reason and ethical duties ("you cannot act"), got back his son and reaffirmed his faith ("where I have to act").&lt;ref&gt;Silentio, Johannes de. ''Fear and Trembling'', Denmark, 1843&lt;/ref&gt;

Another instance of absurdist themes in Kierkegaard's work appears in ''[[The Sickness Unto Death]]'', which Kierkegaard signed with pseudonym ''[[Anti-Climacus]]''. Exploring the forms of despair, Kierkegaard examines the type of despair known as defiance.&lt;ref&gt;''Sickness Unto Death'', Ch.3, part B, sec. 2&lt;/ref&gt; In the opening quotation reproduced at the beginning of the article, Kierkegaard describes how such a man would endure such a defiance and identifies the three major traits of the Absurd Man, later discussed by Albert Camus: a rejection of escaping existence (suicide), a rejection of help from a higher power and acceptance of his absurd (and despairing) condition.

According to Kierkegaard in his autobiography ''[[The Point of View of My Work as an Author]]'', most of his pseudonymous writings are not necessarily reflective of his own opinions. Nevertheless, his work anticipated many absurdist themes and provided its theoretical background.

==Albert Camus==
Though the notion of the 'absurd' pervades all [[Albert Camus]]'s writing, ''[[The Myth of Sisyphus]]'' is his chief work on the subject. In it, Camus considers absurdity as a confrontation, an opposition, a conflict or a "divorce" between two ideals. Specifically, he defines the human condition as absurd, as the confrontation between man's desire for significance, meaning and clarity on the one hand&amp;nbsp;– and the silent, cold universe on the other. He continues that there are specific human experiences evoking notions of absurdity. Such a realization or encounter with the absurd leaves the individual with a choice: [[suicide]], a [[leap of faith]], or recognition. He concludes that recognition is the only defensible option.&lt;ref name="CamusMyth"/&gt;

For Camus, suicide is a "confession" that life is not worth living; it is a choice that implicitly declares that life is "too much." Suicide offers the most basic "way out" of absurdity: the immediate termination of the self and its place in the universe.

The absurd encounter can also arouse a "leap of faith," a term derived from one of Kierkegaard's early pseudonyms, ''Johannes de Silentio'' (although the term was not used by Kierkegaard himself),&lt;ref name=CC&gt;"The Kierkegaardian Leap" in ''The Cambridge Companion to Kierkegaard''.&lt;/ref&gt; where one believes that there is more than the rational life (aesthetic or ethical). To take a "leap of faith," one must act with the "virtue of the absurd" (as ''Johannes de Silentio'' put it), where a suspension of the ethical may need to exist. This faith has no expectations, but is a flexible power initiated by a recognition of the absurd. (Although at some point, one recognizes or encounters the existence of the Absurd and, in response, actively ignores it.) However, Camus states that because the leap of faith escapes rationality and defers to abstraction over personal experience, the leap of faith is not absurd. Camus considers the leap of faith as "philosophical suicide," rejecting both this and physical suicide.&lt;ref name=CC /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Camus, ''Myth of Sisyphus'', p. 41&lt;/ref&gt;

Lastly, a person can choose to embrace the absurd condition. According to Camus, one's freedom&amp;nbsp;– and the opportunity to give life meaning&amp;nbsp;– lies in the recognition of absurdity. If the absurd experience is truly the realization that the universe is fundamentally devoid of absolutes, then we as individuals are truly free. "To live without appeal,"&lt;ref&gt;Camus, ''Myth of Sisyphus'', p. 55&lt;/ref&gt; as he puts it, is a philosophical move to define absolutes and universals subjectively, rather than objectively. The freedom of humans is thus established in a human's natural ability and opportunity to create their own meaning and purpose; to decide (or think) for him- or herself. The individual becomes the most precious unit of existence, representing a set of unique ideals that can be characterized as an entire universe in its own right. In acknowledging the absurdity of seeking any inherent meaning, but continuing this search regardless, one can be happy, gradually developing meaning from the search alone.

Camus states in ''The Myth of Sisyphus'': "Thus I draw from the absurd three consequences, which are my revolt, my freedom, and my passion. By the mere activity of consciousness I transform into a rule of life what was an invitation to death, and I refuse suicide."&lt;ref&gt;Camus, ''Myth of Sisyphus'', p. 64&lt;/ref&gt; "Revolt" here refers to the refusal of suicide and search for meaning despite the revelation of the Absurd; "Freedom" refers to the lack of imprisonment by religious devotion or others' moral codes; "Passion" refers to the most wholehearted experiencing of life, since hope has been rejected, and so he concludes that every moment must be lived fully.

==The meaning of life==
According to absurdism, humans historically attempt to find [[Meaning of life|meaning in their lives]]. Traditionally, this search results in one of two conclusions: either that life is meaningless, or life contains within it a purpose set forth by a [[deity|higher power]]—a belief in [[God]], or adherence to some [[religion]] or other abstract concept. 

===Elusion===
Camus perceives filling the void with some invented belief or meaning as a mere "act of eluding"&amp;mdash;that is, avoiding or escaping rather than acknowledging and embracing the Absurd. To Camus, elusion is a fundamental flaw in [[religion]], [[existentialism]], and various other schools of thought. If the individual eludes the Absurd, then he or she can never confront it.
Camus also concedes that elusion is the most common.

===God===
Even with a spiritual power as the answer to meaning, another question arises: What is the purpose of a belief in God? [[Søren Kierkegaard|Kierkegaard]] believed that there is no human-comprehensible purpose of God, making faith in God absurd itself. Camus on the other hand states that to believe in God is to "deny one of the terms of the contradiction" between humanity and the universe (and is therefore not absurd but what he calls "philosophical suicide"). Camus (as well as Kierkegaard), though, suggests that while absurdity does not lead to belief in God, neither does it lead to the denial of God. Camus notes, "I did not say 'excludes God', which would still amount to asserting".&lt;ref&gt;Camus, ''Myth of Sisyphus'', p. 40, note 7&lt;/ref&gt;

===Personal meaning===
For Camus, the beauty people encounter in life makes it worth living. People may create meaning in their own lives, which may not be the [[Objectivity (philosophy)|objective]] meaning of life (if there is one), but can still provide something to strive for. However, he insisted that one must always maintain an [[irony|ironic]] distance between this invented meaning and the knowledge of the absurd, lest the fictitious meaning take the place of the absurd.

===Freedom===
[[Liberty|Freedom]] cannot be achieved beyond what the absurdity of existence permits; however, the closest one can come to being absolutely free is through acceptance of the Absurd. Camus introduced the idea of "acceptance without resignation" as a way of dealing with the recognition of absurdity, asking whether or not man can "live without appeal", while defining a "conscious revolt" against the avoidance of absurdity of the world. In a world devoid of higher meaning or judicial afterlife, the human nature becomes as close to absolutely free as is humanly possible.

===Hope===
The rejection of hope, in absurdism, denotes the refusal to believe in anything more than what this absurd life provides. Hope, Camus emphasizes, however, has nothing to do with despair (meaning that the two terms are not [[opposite (semantics)|opposite]]s). One can still live fully while rejecting hope, and, in fact, can only do so ''without'' hope. Hope is perceived by the absurdist as another fraudulent method of evading the Absurd, and by not having hope, one is motivated to live every fleeting moment to the fullest. In the words of [[Nikos Kazantzakis]]'s [[epitaph]]: "I hope for nothing.  I fear nothing.  I am free."

===Integrity===
The absurdist is not guided by [[morality]], but rather, by their own [[integrity]]. The absurdist is, in fact, [[Amorality|amoral]] (though not necessarily [[Morality|immoral]]). The Absurdist's view of morality implies an unwavering sense of definite right and wrong at all times, while integrity implies honesty with one's self and consistency in the motivations of one's actions and decisions.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11272">The '''Adjective Check List''' ('''ACL''') is a psychological assessment containing 300 [[Adjective|adjectives]] used to identify common [[psychological trait]]s.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Adjective Check List Manual|last=Gough|first=H.G.|last2=Heilbrun, Jr.|first2=A.B.|publisher=CPP, Inc.|year=2007|isbn=|edition=1983|location=Palo Alto, CA|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The ACL was constructed by [[Harrison G. Gough]] and Alfred B. Heilbrun, Jr. with the goal to assess psychological traits of an individual.&lt;ref&gt;Gough, H. G. (1960). The Adjective Check List as a personalty assessment research technique. ''Psychological Reports, 6,'' 107-122.&lt;/ref&gt; The ACL measures 37 scales within 5 categories: [[modus operandi]] (4 scales), need (15 scales), topical (9 scales), [[transactional analysis]] (5 scales), and origence-intellectence (4 scales).&lt;ref name="mindgarden" /&gt; To complete the ACL, respondents select the adjectives that they believe describe themselves (or someone else). Any number of items may be selected from the list of adjectives. In this way, the results are customized to include only those adjectives salient to the individual being assessed. The ACL takes between 10-15 minutes to complete and may be administered to individuals, groups, or used by [[researcher]]s to describe study participants.&lt;ref name=mindgarden&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mindgarden.com/products/acl.htm|title=The Adjective Check List |accessdate=8 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ACL is protected by [[Copyright|copyright law]], published by Consulting Psychologists Press, and distributed by Mind Garden, Inc.

The ACL was first developed in the early days of the Institute of Personality Assessment and Research at the [[University of California, Berkeley]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; It has been used since 1952 by many psychologists worldwide and is one of the 100 most frequently used and cited tests in psychology.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== ACL Research and Uses ==
"The ACL offers several advantages. It is self-administering, may be completed in 10 to 15 minutes, arouses little resistance or anxiety, and has proved useful in studies of highly effective persons in occupations other than politics such as architecture, mathematics, law, medicine, and management.

"Further, as a multidimensional instrument, which taps several domains of personality, the ACL affords an appraisal of positive as well as negative factors in human behavior, thus avoiding the frequently found preoccupation with psychopathological bases of political activity. Additionally, as an established standardized, and quantitative assessment procedure, the ACL reduces the problems of reliability and comparability entailed in studies relying on interviews or on ad hoc, limited use or abbreviated personality measures” (Constantini &amp; Craik, 1980, p. 645).&lt;ref&gt;Constantini, E., &amp; Craik, K. H. (1980). Personality and politicians: California party leaders, 1960-1976. ''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology'', ''38''(4), 641.-661.&lt;/ref&gt;

"We propose that the Gough-Heilbrun Adjective Check List is another broad-range instrument with considerable promise as a general cross-cultural research tool. The argument is based on: the nature of the task, which seems appropriate in many cultural settings; the versatility of the method in addressing a variety of research questions; the fact that the instrument has been translated into many different languages; and the successful use of the method in recent cross-cultural studies" (Williams &amp; Best, 1983, p. 164).&lt;ref&gt;Williams, J. E., &amp; Best, D. L. (1983). The Gough-Heilbrun Adjective Check List as a cross-cultural research tool. In J.B Deregowski, S. Dziurawiec, &amp; R.C. Annis (Eds.) ''Expiscations in cross-cultural psychology.'' Netherlands: Swets &amp; Zeitlinger B.V.&lt;/ref&gt;

== ACL Success Factors at Work&lt;ref name="mindgarden" /&gt; ==
The ACL scales were realigned in 2012 by Rob Devine in consultation with Gough to highlight how collections of characteristics, skills, and competencies impact success at work. This realignment, called Success Factors at Work, uses 30 of the original 37 ACL scales and assigns each to one of six Work Success Factors which have proven to be central and important to success at work. The six Work Success Factors are:
* Managing Self
* Thinking and Deciding
* Getting Things Done
* Managing Work
* Working with People
* Leading People

== ACL Scales ==
The ACL consists of 37 scales within 5 categories:  modus operandi (4 scales), need (15 scales), topical (9 scales), transactional analysis (5 scales), and origence-intellectence (4 scales).

* '''Communality:''' Correspondence of responses to the pattern of checking typically found among people-in-general.

=== Need Scales ===
The Need Scales assess an individual's psychological needs or wants. These were identified as important in [[Henry Murray|Henry A. Murray]]'s [[Murray's system of needs|Need-Press Theory of Personality]].&lt;ref&gt;Murray, H.A. (1938). ''Explorations in Personality.'' New York: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Topical Scales assess a diverse set of attributes, potentialities, and role characteristics.
* '''Counseling Readiness:''' Readiness to accept counseling or professional advice in regard to personal problems, psychological difficulties, and the like.&lt;ref&gt;Heilbrun, A. B., Jr., &amp; Sullivan, D. J. (1962). The prediction of counseling readiness. ''Personnel and Guidance Journal, 41'', 112-117.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Self-Control:''' The extent to which self-control is imposed, and valued.
* '''Self-Confidence:''' Self-confidence, poise, and self-assurance.

=== Transactional Analysis Scales ===
The Transactional Analysis Scales - an Egogram - assess components of ego functioning. These were identified as important by [[Eric Berne]]'s [[Transactional analysis|Transactional Analysis]] theory of personality.&lt;ref&gt;Berne, E. (1961).

=== Origence-Intellectence Scales ===
The Origence-Intellectence Scales assess the balance between preferences for affective-emotional and rational-realistic models of functioning. These were identified as important by George S. Welsh's creativity and intelligence research.&lt;ref&gt;Welsh, G. S. (1975). ''Creativity and intelligence: A personality approach.'' Chapel Hill, North Carolina: Institute for Research in Social Science, University of North Carolina.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Welsh, G. S. (1977). Personality correlates of intelligence and creativity in gifted adolescents. In J.C. Stanley, W.C. George, &amp; C.H. Solano (Eds.), ''The gifted and the creative: A fifty-year perspective.'' Baltimore, MD: Johns Hopkins University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''High Origence - Low Intellectence:''' Feelings and emotion (high origence) valued more highly than detachment and rationality (low intellectence). High scores suggest informality, vitality, and playfulness.
* '''High Origence - High Intellectence:''' High value placed on both affect (origence) and rationality (intellectence). High scores suggest versatility, unconventionality, and individuality.
* '''Low Origence - Low Intellectence:''' No particular value placed on either origence or intellectence. High scores suggest contentment, conventionality, and optimism.
* '''Low Origence - High Intellectence:''' Rationality and analysis (intellectence) valued more highly than feelings and emotion (origence). High scores suggest logicality, industriousness, and cognitive clarity.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6027">'''Apperception''' (from the [[Latin]] ''ad-'', "to, toward" and ''percipere'', "to perceive, gain, secure, learn, or feel") is any of several aspects of perception and consciousness in such fields as [[psychology]], [[philosophy]] and [[epistemology]].

==Meaning in philosophy==
The term originates with [[René Descartes]] in the form of the word ''apercevoir'' in his book ''Traité des passions''. [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]] introduced the concept of apperception into the more technical philosophical tradition, in his work ''Principes de la nature fondés en raison et de la grâce''; although he used the word practically in the sense of the modern [[attention]], by which an object is apprehended as "not-self" and yet in relation to the self.&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Apperception |volume=2 |page=221}} This cites:
*Karl Lange, ''Ueber Apperception'' (6th ed. revised, Leipzig, 1899; trans. E. E. Brown, Boston, 1893)
*[[George Stout|G. F. Stout]], ''Analytic Psychology'' (London, 1896), bk. ii. ch. viii.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Immanuel Kant]] distinguished [[transcendental apperception]] from empirical apperception.  The first is the perception of an object as involving the consciousness of the pure self as subject--"the pure, original, unchangeable consciousness that is the necessary condition of experience and the ultimate foundation of the unity of experience."  The second is "the consciousness of the concrete actual self with its changing states", the so-called "inner sense." (Otto F. Kraushaar in ''Runes''&lt;ref name="Dagobert D 1972"&gt;[[Dagobert D. Runes|Runes, Dagobert D.]] (ed.), ''Dictionary of Philosophy'', Littlefield, Adams, and Company, Totowa, NJ, 1972.&lt;/ref&gt;).  Transcendental apperception is almost equivalent to self-consciousness; the existence of the ego may be more or less prominent, but it is always involved.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;  See ''[[Kantianism]]''.

===Meaning in the writings of Theodor Lipps===
The German philosopher [[Theodor Lipps]] distinguished the terms perception and apperception in his 1902 work, ''Vom Fühlen, Wollen und Denken''.&lt;ref&gt;Lipps, Theodor. ''Vom Fuehlen, Wollen und Denken.'' Leipzig, Verlag von Johann Ambrosius Barth, 1902. See pages 6-7.&lt;/ref&gt; Perception, for Lipps, is a generic term that covers such psychic occurrences as auditory and tactile sensations, recollections, visual representations in memory, etc. But these perceptions do not always hold our conscious attention - perception is not always consciously noticed. Lipps uses the term apperception, then, to refer to attentive perception, wherein, in addition to merely perceiving an object, either one also consciously attends to the perceived object or one also attends to the very perception of the object.&lt;ref&gt;''Judgement and Truth in Early Analytic Philosophy and Phenomenology''. ed. Mark Textor. Springer, 2013. pp. 14f.&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Meaning in psychology==
In [[psychology]], apperception is "the process by which new experience is assimilated to and transformed by the residuum of past experience of an individual to form a new whole."&lt;ref name="Dagobert D 1972"/&gt; In short, it is to perceive new experience in relation to past experience. The term is found in the early psychologies of [[Herbert Spencer]], [[Hermann Lotze]], and [[Wilhelm Wundt]]. It originally means passing the threshold into consciousness, i.e., to perceive. But the percept is changed when reaching consciousness due to the contextual presence of the other stuff already there, thus it is not perceived but apperceived.

According to [[Johann Friedrich Herbart]] apperception is that process by which an aggregate or "mass" of presentations becomes systematized (''apperceptions-system'') by the accretion of new elements, either sense-given or product of the inner workings of the mind.  He thus emphasizes in apperception the connection with the self as resulting from the sum of antecedent experience.  Hence in education the teacher should fully acquaint himself with the mental development of the pupil, in order that he may make full use of what the pupil already knows.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

Apperception is thus a general term for all mental processes in which a presentation is brought into connection with an already existent and systematized mental conception, and thereby is classified, explained or, in a word, understood; e.g. a new scientific phenomenon is explained in the light of phenomena already analysed and classified. The whole intelligent life of man is, consciously or unconsciously, a process of apperception, in as much as every act of attention involves the appercipient process.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

===Example===
A rich child and a poor child walking together come across the same ten dollar bill on the sidewalk. The rich child says it is not very much money and the poor child says it is a lot of money. The difference lies in how they ''apperceive'' the same event – the lens of past experience through which they see and value (or devalue) the money.|Christopher Ott&lt;ref&gt;Ott, Christopher, ''The Evolution of Perception and the Cosmology of Substance'', iUniverse, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;
==Meaning in epistemology==
In [[epistemology]], apperception is "the introspective or reflective apprehension by the mind of its own inner states".&lt;ref name="Dagobert D 1972"/&gt;

'''{{lang|la|Audi alteram partem}}''' (or '''{{lang|la|audiatur et altera pars}}''') is a [[Latin]] [[List of Latin phrases|phrase]] meaning "listen to the other side", or "let the other side be heard as well".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.m-w.com/dictionary/audi+alteram+partem audi alteram partem: Definition from the Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt; It is the principle that no person should be judged without a fair hearing in which each party is given the opportunity to respond to the evidence against them.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.duhaime.org/LegalDictionary/A/Audialterampartem.aspx Audi alteram partem's entry in the duhaime.org legal dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt;

"Audi alteram partem" is considered to be a principle of [[fundamental justice]] or [[Equity (law)|equity]] or the principle of natural justice in most [[legal system]]s. This principle includes the rights of a party or his lawyers to confront the [[witness]]es against him, to have a fair opportunity to challenge the [[evidence (law)|evidence]] presented by the other party, to summon one's own witnesses and to present evidence, and to have counsel, if necessary at public expense, in order to make one's case properly.

The phrase has come to be used as the motto for various political and judicial organisations, and is also the origin of the name of the German carmaker [[Audi]].

==History of use==
As a general principle of rationality in reaching conclusions in disputed matters, "Hear both sides" was treated as part of common wisdom by the [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] dramatists.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. [[Aeschylus]], ''[[The Eumenides]]'' 431, 435&lt;/ref&gt; A similar principle can also be found in Islamic law, based on a [[hadith]] indicating that in litigation, both parties must be heard.&lt;ref&gt; Imam Abu Dawud. 2008. ''Sunan Abu Dawud Vol. 3 (Translated to English by Ahmad Hasan)''. Riyadh: Darussalam,, Hadith No. 3575, Grade: Hasan &lt;/ref&gt; The principle was referred to by the [[International Court of Justice]] in the ''Nuclear Tests'' case, referring to [[France]]'s non-appearance at judgment.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/files/58/6093.pdf Nuclear Tests (Australia c. France)]'', C. I. J., December 20, 1974, p. 265&lt;/ref&gt; Modern legal systems differ on whether individuals can be convicted ''[[trial in absentia|in absentia]]''. The principle is used in [[labour law]] matters in countries like South Africa and Zimbabwe.

==Other uses==

The Political Interest Society of the [[University of Melbourne]] uses the phrase as its motto.&lt;ref&gt;http://umsu.unimelb.edu.au/clubs/political-interest-society/&lt;/ref&gt; The All-Campus Judicial Council of the [[University of Rochester]] has used the phrase as its motto since 2001.&lt;ref&gt;http://sa.rochester.edu/sa/acjc/&lt;/ref&gt;

The phrase is also the origin of the name of [[Germany|German]] carmaker [[Audi]]. Founder [[August Horch]] had left his previous company, [[Motorwagenwerke]], after a dispute with partners and founded a new company on 16 July 1909, initially named the ''August Horch Automobilwerke GmbH''. His former partners sued him for trademark infringement, and the German [[Reichsgericht]] (Supreme Court) ruled that the Horch brand belonged to his former company.&lt;ref name="chronicle2"&gt;[http://www.audiusa.com/us/brand/en/about/main/history.html Audi History] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100209000116/http://www.audiusa.com/us/brand/en/about/main/history.html |date=9 February 2010 }} audiusa.com&lt;/ref&gt; Horch therefore called a meeting with close business friends Paul and Franz Fikentscher, to come up with a new name for the company. During this meeting, Franz's son was quietly studying Latin in a corner of the room. Several times he looked like he was on the verge of saying something but would just swallow his words and continue working, until he finally blurted out, "Father&amp;nbsp;–  ''audiatur et altera pars''...&amp;nbsp;wouldn't it be a good idea to call it ''audi'' instead of ''horch''?"&lt;ref&gt;August Horch: "Ich baute Autos – Vom Schmiedelehrling zum Autoindustriellen", Schützen-Verlag Berlin 1937&lt;/ref&gt; "Horch!" in German means "Hark!" or "hear", which is "Audi" in the singular imperative form of "audire" – "to listen" – in Latin. The idea was enthusiastically accepted by everyone attending the meeting, and the company was registered as ''Audi Automobilwerke GmbH Zwickau'' in 1910.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6390">A '''Braitenberg vehicle''' is a concept conceived in a [[thought experiment]] by the [[Italy|Italian]]-[[Austria]]n [[cybernetics|cyberneticist]] [[Valentino Braitenberg]]. The book models the animal world in a minimalistic and constructive way, from simple reactive behaviours (like [[phototaxis]]) through the simplest vehicles, to the formation of concepts, spatial behaviour, and generation of ideas.

For the simplest vehicles, the motion of the vehicle is directly controlled by some sensors (for example photo cells). Yet the resulting behaviour may appear complex or even intelligent.

== Mechanism ==
[[Image:Braitenberg Vehicle 2ab.png|thumbnail|Vehicles 2a, 2b]]

A Braitenberg vehicle is an agent that can autonomously move around based on its sensor inputs. It has primitive [[sensors]] that measure some stimulus at a point, and wheels (each driven by its own motor) that function as [[actuators]] or effectors. In the simplest configuration, a sensor is directly connected to an effector, so that a sensed signal immediately produces a movement of the wheel.

Depending on how sensors and wheels are connected, the vehicle exhibits different behaviors (which can be goal-oriented). This means that, depending on the sensor-motor wiring, it appears to strive to achieve certain situations and to avoid others, changing course when the situation changes.&lt;ref name="braitenberg84vehicles"&gt;Braitenberg, V. (1984). Vehicles: Experiments in synthetic psychology. Cambridge, MA: MIT Press. {{cite web |url=http://mitpress.mit.edu/catalog/item/default.asp?ttype%3D2%26tid%3D3323 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-06-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100129022037/http://mitpress.mit.edu/catalog/item/default.asp?ttype=2&amp;tid=3323 |archivedate=2010-01-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The connections between sensors and actuators for the simplest vehicles (2 and 3) can be [[ipsilateral]] or [[contralateral]], and excitatory or inhibitory, producing four combinations with different behaviours named fear, aggression, liking, and love. These correspond to biological positive and negative taxes&lt;ref&gt;Fraenkel, G. S., and Gunn,D.L. (1961). "The orientation of animals. Kineses, taxes and compass reactions". Dover Publications&lt;/ref&gt; present in many animals species.

== Examples ==

The following examples are some of Braitenberg's simplest vehicles.

===Vehicle 1 - Getting Around===
The first vehicle has one sensor (e.g. a temperature detector) that directly stimulates its single wheel in a directly proportional way. The vehicle moves ideally in one dimension only and can stand still or move forward at varying speed depending on the sensed temperature. When forces like asymmetric friction come into play, the vehicle could deviate from its straight line motion in unpredictable ways akin to Brownian motion.

This behavior might be understood by a human observer as a creature that is 'alive' like an insect and 'restless', never stopping in its movement. The low velocity in regions of low temperature might be interpreted as a preference for cold areas.&lt;ref name="braitenberg84vehicles"/&gt;

===Vehicle 2a=== 
A slightly more complex agent has two (left and right) symmetric sensors (e.g. light detectors) each stimulating a wheel on the same side of the body. This vehicle represents a model of negative animal [[Taxis|tropotaxis]]. It obeys the following rule:
* More light right → right wheel turns faster → turns towards the left, away from the light.
This is more efficient as a behavior to escape from the light source, since the creature can move in different directions, and tends to orient towards the direction from which least light comes.

In another variation, the connections are negative or inhibitory: more light → slower movement. In this case, the agents move away from the dark and towards the light.

===Vehicle 2b=== 
The agent has the same two (left and right) symmetric sensors (e.g. light detectors), but each one stimulating a wheel on the other side of the body. It obeys the following rule:
* More light left → right wheel turns faster → turns towards the left, closer to the light.
As a result, the robot follows the light; it moves to be closer to the light.

== Behavior ==
[[File:Braitenberg Vehicle 4a.png|thumbnail|Complex behavior]]
In a complex environment with several sources of stimulus, Braitenberg vehicles will exhibit complex and dynamic behavior.

Depending on the connections between sensors and actuators, a Braitenberg vehicle might move close to a source, but not touch it, run away very fast, or describe circles or figures-of-eight around a point.

This behavior is undoubtedly goal-directed, flexible and adaptive, and might even appear to be intelligent, the way some minimal intelligence is attributed to a cockroach. Yet, the functioning of the agent is purely mechanical, without any [[information processing]] or other apparently [[cognition|cognitive]] processes.

Often, [[BEAM robotics]] implements these sorts of behaviors.

[[File:Cartesian Product qtl1.svg|thumb|Cartesian product &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle A \times B&lt;/math&gt; of the sets &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle A=\{x,y,z\}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle B=\{1,2,3\}&lt;/math&gt;]]

In [[set theory]] (and, usually, in other parts of [[mathematics]]), a '''Cartesian product''' is a [[mathematical operation]] that returns a [[set (mathematics)|set]] (or '''product set''' or simply '''product''') from multiple sets. That is, for sets ''A'' and ''B'', the Cartesian product {{nowrap|''A'' × ''B''}} is the set of all [[ordered pair]]s {{nowrap|(''a'', ''b'')}} where {{nowrap|''a'' ∈ ''A''}} and {{nowrap|''b'' ∈ ''B''}}. Products can be specified using [[set-builder notation]], e.g.
: &lt;math&gt;A\times B = \{\,(a,b)\mid a\in A \ \mbox{ and } \ b\in B\,\}.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Warner|first=S.|title=Modern Algebra|page=6|publisher=[[Dover Publications]]|date=1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A table can be created by taking the Cartesian product of a set of rows and a set of columns. If the Cartesian product {{nowrap|''rows'' × ''columns''}} is taken, the cells of the table contain ordered pairs of the form {{nowrap|(row value, column value)}}.

More generally, a Cartesian product of ''n'' sets, also known as an '''''n''-fold Cartesian product''', can be represented by an array of ''n'' dimensions, where each element is an ''n''-[[tuple]]. An ordered pair is a [[Tuple#Names for tuples of specific lengths|2-tuple or couple]].

The Cartesian product is named after [[René Descartes]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cartesian|date=2009|website=Merriam-Webster.com|accessdate=December 1, 2009|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/cartesian}}&lt;/ref&gt; whose formulation of [[analytic geometry]] gave rise to the concept, which is further generalized in terms of [[direct product]].

== Examples ==

=== A deck of cards ===
[[File:Piatnikcards.jpg|thumb|Standard 52-card deck]]

An illustrative example is the [[standard 52-card deck]]. The [[Playing cards#Anglo-American|standard playing card]] ranks {A, K, Q, J, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2} form a 13-element set. The card suits {{nowrap|{♠, {{color|#c00000|♥}}, {{color|#c00000|♦}}, ♣} }} form a four-element set. The Cartesian product of these sets returns a 52-element set consisting of 52 [[ordered pairs]], which correspond to all 52 possible playing cards. 

{{nowrap|''Ranks'' × ''Suits''}} returns a set of the form {(A, ♠), (A, {{color|#c00000|♥}}), (A, {{color|#c00000|♦}}), (A, ♣), (K, ♠), ..., (3, ♣), (2, ♠), (2, {{color|#c00000|♥}}), (2, {{color|#c00000|♦}}), (2, ♣)}.

{{nowrap|''Suits'' × ''Ranks''}} returns a set of the form {(♠, A), (♠, K), (♠, Q), (♠, J), (♠, 10), ..., ({{color|#c00000|♥}}, 6), ({{color|#c00000|♥}}, 5), ({{color|#c00000|♥}}, 4), ({{color|#c00000|♥}}, 3), ({{color|#c00000|♥}}, 2)}.

Both sets are distinct, even disjoint.

=== A two-dimensional coordinate system ===
[[File:Cartesian-coordinate-system.svg|thumb|Cartesian coordinates of example points]]

The main historical example is the [[Cartesian plane]] in [[analytic geometry]]. In order to represent geometrical shapes in a numerical way and extract numerical information from shapes' numerical representations, [[René Descartes]] assigned to each point in the plane a pair of [[real number]]s, called its coordinates. Usually, such a pair's first and second components are called its ''x'' and ''y'' coordinates, respectively (see picture). The set of all such pairs (i.e. the Cartesian product {{nowrap|ℝ×ℝ}} with ℝ denoting the real numbers) is thus assigned to the set of all points in the plane.

== Most common implementation (set theory) ==
{{Main article|Implementation of mathematics in set theory}}

A formal definition of the Cartesian product from [[set theory|set-theoretical]] principles follows from a definition of [[ordered pair]]. The most common definition of ordered pairs, the [[Ordered pair#Kuratowski definition|Kuratowski definition]], is &lt;math&gt;(x, y) = \{\{x\},\{x, y\}\}&lt;/math&gt;. Under this definition, &lt;math&gt;(x, y)&lt;/math&gt; is an element of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{P}(\mathcal{P}(X \cup Y))&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;X\times Y&lt;/math&gt; is a subset of that set, where &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{P}&lt;/math&gt; represents the [[power set]] operator. Therefore, the existence of the Cartesian product of any two sets in [[ZFC]] follows from the axioms of [[axiom of pairing|pairing]], [[axiom of union|union]], [[axiom of power set|power set]], and [[axiom schema of specification|specification]]. Since [[function (mathematics)|functions]] are usually defined as a special case of [[relation (mathematics)|relations]], and relations are usually defined as subsets of the Cartesian product, the definition of the two-set Cartesian product is necessarily prior to most other definitions.

=== Non-commutativity and non-associativity ===
Let ''A'', ''B'', ''C'', and ''D'' be sets.

The Cartesian product {{nowrap|''A'' × ''B''}} is not [[commutative]],
: &lt;math&gt;A \times B \neq B \times A,&lt;/math&gt;
because the [[ordered pair]]s are reversed unless at least one of the following conditions is satisfied:&lt;ref name="cnx"/&gt;
* ''A'' is equal to ''B'', or
* ''A'' or ''B'' is the [[empty set]].

For example:
: ''A'' = {1,2}; ''B'' = {3,4}
:: ''A'' × ''B'' = {1,2} × {3,4} = {(1,3), (1,4), (2,3), (2,4)}
:: ''B'' × ''A'' = {3,4} × {1,2} = {(3,1), (3,2), (4,1), (4,2)}

: ''A'' = ''B'' = {1,2}
:: ''A'' × ''B'' = ''B'' × ''A'' = {1,2} × {1,2} = {(1,1), (1,2), (2,1), (2,2)}

: ''A'' = {1,2}; ''B'' = ∅
:: ''A'' × ''B'' = {1,2} × ∅ = ∅
:: ''B'' × ''A'' = ∅ × {1,2} = ∅


Strictly speaking, the Cartesian product is not [[associative]] (unless one of the involved sets is empty).
: &lt;math&gt;(A\times B)\times C \neq A \times (B \times C)&lt;/math&gt;
If for example ''A'' = {1}, then (''A'' × ''A'') × ''A'' = { ((1,1),1) } ≠ { (1,(1,1)) } = ''A'' × (''A'' × ''A'').

The Cartesian product behaves nicely with respect to [[Intersection (set theory)|intersections]] (see leftmost picture).
: &lt;math&gt;(A \cap B) \times (C \cap D) = (A \times C) \cap (B \times D)&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name="planetmath"&gt;{{planetmath reference|id=359|title=CartesianProduct}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In most cases the above statement is not true if we replace intersection with [[Union (set theory)|union]] (see middle picture).
: &lt;math&gt;(A \cup B) \times (C \cup D) \neq (A \times C) \cup (B \times D)&lt;/math&gt;

In fact, we have that:
: &lt;math&gt;(A \times C) \cup (B \times D) = [(A \setminus B) \times C] \cup [(A \cap B) \times (C \cup D)] \cup [(B \setminus A) \times D]&lt;/math&gt;

For the set difference we also have the following identity:
: &lt;math&gt;(A \times C) \setminus (B \times D) = [A \times (C \setminus D)] \cup [(A \setminus B) \times C] &lt;/math&gt;

Here are some rules demonstrating distributivity with other operators (see rightmost picture):&lt;ref name="cnx"&gt;Singh, S. (August 27, 2009). ''Cartesian product''. Retrieved from the Connexions Web site: http://cnx.org/content/m15207/1.5/&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;A \times (B \setminus C) = (A \times B) \setminus (A \times C),&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;A^\complement&lt;/math&gt; denotes the [[absolute complement]] of ''A''.

Other properties related with [[subset]]s are:
: &lt;math&gt;\text{if } A \subseteq B \text{ then } A \times C \subseteq B \times C,&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\text{if both } A,B \neq \emptyset \text{ then } A \times B \subseteq C \times D \iff A \subseteq C\text{ and } B \subseteq D.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cartesian Product of Subsets.

=== Cardinality ===
{{See also|Cardinal arithmetic}}

The [[cardinality]] of a set is the number of elements of the set. For example, defining two sets: {{nowrap|1=''A'' = {a, b}}} and {{nowrap|1=''B'' = {5, 6}.}} Both set ''A'' and set ''B'' consist of two elements each. Their Cartesian product, written as {{nowrap|''A'' × ''B''}}, results in a new set which has the following elements:
: ''A'' × ''B'' = {(a,5), (a,6), (b,5), (b,6)}.

Each element of ''A'' is paired with each element of ''B''. Each pair makes up one element of the output set.
The number of values in each element of the resulting set is equal to the number of sets whose cartesian product is being taken; 2 in this case.
The cardinality of the output set is equal to the product of the cardinalities of all the input sets. That is,
: |''A'' × ''B''| = |''A''| · |''B''|.
In this case, |''A'' × ''B''| = 4

Similarly
: |''A'' × ''B'' × ''C''| = |''A''| · |''B''| · |''C''|
and so on.

The set {{nowrap|''A'' × ''B''}} is [[infinite set|infinite]] if either ''A'' or ''B'' is infinite and the other set is not the empty set.&lt;ref&gt;Peter S. (1998). A Crash Course in the Mathematics of Infinite Sets. ''St. John's Review, 44''(2), 35–59. Retrieved August 1, 2011, from http://www.mathpath.org/concepts/infinity.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cartesian products of several sets ==

=== &lt;var&gt;n&lt;/var&gt;-ary Cartesian product ===
The Cartesian product can be generalized to the '''''n''-ary Cartesian product''' over ''n'' sets ''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''X&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' as the set

: &lt;math&gt;X_1\times\cdots\times X_n = \{(x_1, \ldots, x_n) \mid x_i \in X_i \ \text{for every} \ i \in \{1, \ldots, n\} \}.&lt;/math&gt;

of [[tuple|''n''-tuple]]s. If tuples are defined as [[Tuple#Tuples_as_nested_ordered_pairs|nested ordered pairs]], it can be identified with {{nowrap|(''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; × ... × ''X&lt;sub&gt;n−1&lt;/sub&gt;'') × ''X&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''}}. If a tuple is defined as a function on {{nowrap|{1, 2, ..., ''n''} }} that takes its value at ''i'' to be the ''i''th element of the tuple, then the Cartesian product ''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;×...×''X''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; is the set of functions

: &lt;math&gt;\{ x:\{1,\ldots,n\}\to X_1\cup\ldots\cup X_n \ | \ x(i)\in X_i \ \text{for every} \ i \in \{1, \ldots, n\} \}.&lt;/math&gt;

=== &lt;var&gt;n&lt;/var&gt;-ary Cartesian power ===
The '''Cartesian square''' of a set ''X'' is the Cartesian product {{nowrap|1=''X''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = ''X'' × ''X''}}.
An example is the 2-dimensional [[plane (mathematics)|plane]] {{nowrap|1='''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = '''R''' × '''R'''}} where '''R''' is the set of [[real number]]s: '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is the set of all points {{nowrap|(''x'',''y'')}} where ''x'' and ''y'' are real numbers (see the [[Cartesian coordinate system]]).

The ''' ''n''-ary Cartesian power''' of a set ''X'' can be defined as

: &lt;math&gt; X^n = \underbrace{ X \times X \times \cdots \times X }_{n}= \{ (x_1,\ldots,x_n) \ | \ x_i \in X \ \text{for every} \ i \in \{1, \ldots, n\} \}.&lt;/math&gt;

An example of this is {{nowrap|1='''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; = '''R''' × '''R''' × '''R'''}}, with '''R''' again the set of real numbers, and more generally '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;.

The ''n''-ary cartesian power of a set ''X'' is [[isomorphism|isomorphic]] to the space of functions from an ''n''-element set to ''X''.  As a special case, the 0-ary cartesian power of ''X'' may be taken to be a [[singleton set]], corresponding to the [[empty function]] with [[codomain]] ''X''.

=== Infinite Cartesian products ===
It is possible to define the Cartesian product of an arbitrary (possibly [[Infinity|infinite]]) [[indexed family]] of sets. If ''I'' is any [[index set]], and &lt;math&gt;\{X_i\}_{i\in I}&lt;/math&gt; is a family of sets indexed by ''I'', then the Cartesian product of the sets in ''X'' is defined to be 

: &lt;math&gt;\prod_{i \in I} X_i = \left\{\left. f: I \to \bigcup_{i \in I} X_i\ \right|\ (\forall i)(f(i) \in X_i)\right\},&lt;/math&gt; 

that is, the set of all functions defined on the [[index set]] such that the value of the function at a particular index ''i'' is an element of ''X&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''.  Even if each of the ''X&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' is nonempty, the Cartesian product may be empty if the [[axiom of choice]] (which is equivalent to the statement that every such product is nonempty) is not assumed.

For each ''j'' in ''I'', the function 
: &lt;math&gt;  \pi_{j}: \prod_{i \in I} X_i \to X_{j},&lt;/math&gt;
defined by &lt;math&gt;\pi_{j}(f) = f(j)&lt;/math&gt; is called the '''''j''th [[Projection (mathematics)|projection map]]'''.

'''Cartesian power''' is a Cartesian product where all the factors ''X&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' are the same set ''X''. In this case, 
: &lt;math&gt;\prod_{i \in I} X_i = \prod_{i \in I} X&lt;/math&gt; 
is the set of all functions from ''I'' to ''X'', and is frequently denoted ''X&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt;''. This case is important in the study of [[cardinal exponentiation]]. An important special case is when the index set is &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt;, the [[natural numbers]]: this Cartesian product is the set of all infinite sequences with the ''i''th term in its corresponding set ''X&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''. For example, each element of 
: &lt;math&gt;\prod_{n = 1}^\infty \mathbb R = \mathbb R \times \mathbb R \times \cdots&lt;/math&gt;
can be visualized as a [[Euclidean vector|vector]] with countably infinite real number components. This set is frequently denoted &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^\omega&lt;/math&gt;, or &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^{\mathbb{N}}&lt;/math&gt;.

== Other forms ==

=== Abbreviated form ===
If several sets are being multiplied together, e.g. ''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''X''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''X''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, …, then some authors&lt;ref&gt;Osborne, M., and Rubinstein, A., 1994. ''A Course in Game Theory''. MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt; choose to abbreviate the Cartesian product as simply &lt;big&gt;&amp;times;&lt;/big&gt;''X''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;.

=== Cartesian product of functions ===
If ''f'' is a function from ''A'' to ''B'' and ''g'' is a function from ''X'' to ''Y'', their Cartesian product {{nowrap|''f'' × ''g''}} is a function from {{nowrap|''A'' × ''X''}} to {{nowrap|''B'' × ''Y''}} with
: &lt;math&gt;(f\times g)(a, x) = (f(a), g(x)).&lt;/math&gt;

This can be extended to [[tuple]]s and infinite collections of functions.
This is different from the standard cartesian product of functions considered as sets.

=== Cylinder ===
Let &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; be a set and &lt;math&gt;B \subseteq A&lt;/math&gt;. Then the ''cylinder'' of &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; with respect to &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is the Cartesian product &lt;math&gt;B \times A&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;. 

Normally, &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is considered to be the universe of the context and is left away. For example, if &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; is a subset of the natural numbers &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt;, then the cylinder of &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;B \times \mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt;.

== Definitions outside set theory ==

===Category theory===
Although the Cartesian product is traditionally applied to sets, [[category theory]] provides a more general interpretation of the [[product (category theory)|product]] of mathematical structures. This is distinct from, although related to, the notion of a [[Cartesian square (category theory)|Cartesian square]] in category theory, which is a generalization of the [[fiber product]].

[[Exponential object|Exponentiation]] is the [[right adjoint]] of the Cartesian product; thus any category with a Cartesian product (and a [[final object]]) is a [[Cartesian closed category]].

===Graph theory===
In [[graph theory]] the [[Cartesian product of graphs|Cartesian product of two graphs]] ''G'' and ''H'' is the graph denoted by {{nowrap|''G'' × ''H''}} whose [[vertex (graph theory)|vertex]] set is the (ordinary) Cartesian product {{nowrap|''V''(''G'') × ''V''(''H'')}} and such that two vertices (''u'',''v'') and (''u''′,''v''′) are adjacent in {{nowrap|''G'' × ''H''}} if and only if {{nowrap|1=''u'' = ''u''′}} and ''v'' is adjacent with ''v''′ in ''H'', ''or'' {{nowrap|1=''v'' = ''v''′}} and ''u'' is adjacent with ''u''′ in ''G''.  The Cartesian product of graphs is not a [[product (category theory)|product]] in the sense of category theory.  Instead, the categorical product is known as the [[tensor product of graphs]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5753">The '''Cleveland child abuse scandal''' was a 1987 wave of suspected child sexual abuse cases in [[Cleveland, England]].

==Background==
At this time, the administrative county of Cleveland, established in 1974 from parts of [[Yorkshire]] and [[County Durham]] in the [[Teesside]] area, included four main towns: [[Stockton-on-Tees]], [[Hartlepool]], [[Middlesbrough]] and [[Redcar]].&lt;ref name=Webmag&gt;{{cite news|last1=Charles|first1=Pragnell|title=The Cleveland Sexual Abuse Scandal|url=http://www.davidlane.org/children/choct2002/choct2002/pragnell%20cleveland%20abuse.html|accessdate=July 21, 2014|publisher=Children Webmag}}&lt;/ref&gt; It ceased to exist in 1996.

==History==
In the years prior to the scandal, levels of reported child abuse in the Cleveland area were consistent with those of other parts of the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name=Webmag/&gt; However, in 1987, during the period of February to July, many children living in Cleveland were removed from their homes by social service agencies and diagnosed as sexually abused.&lt;ref name="Gazette"/&gt; The 121 diagnoses were made by two [[pediatrics|paediatricians]] at a Middlesbrough hospital, Marietta Higgs and Geoffrey Wyatt, using the later-discredited diagnostic of [[reflex anal dilation]].&lt;ref name="Gazette"/&gt; When there were not enough foster homes in which to place the allegedly abused children, social services began to house the children in a ward at the local hospital.&lt;ref name=Webmag/&gt; 

Later, the test being used to establish child abuse was contested by the area police surgeon, and cooperation between the social workers, police and hospital doctors involved in diagnosis began to disintegrate.&lt;ref name=Webmag/&gt; In addition, there was public concern regarding the practices being used by the local social service agency, such as the removal of children from their homes in the middle of the night.&lt;ref name=Webmag/&gt; In May 1987, parents marched from the hospital where their children were being held to the local newspaper. The resulting media coverage caused the social service agency's practices to receive public scrutiny and criticism.&lt;ref name=Webmag/&gt; In response, the Butler-Sloss report was commissioned by the Secretary of State for Social Services in July 1987 and published in 1988.&lt;ref name="Gazette"/&gt;  The report was led by [[Elizabeth Butler-Sloss]] and it concluded that most of the diagnoses were incorrect.&lt;ref name="Gazette"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.gazettelive.co.uk/news/local-news/20-years-cleveland-child-sex-3729871 |title=20 years on from the Cleveland Child Sex Abuse Scandal |newspaper=GazetteLive |date=8 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As a result, 94 of the 121 children were returned to their homes.&lt;ref name="Gazette"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Staff writer, [http://www.childrenwebmag.com/articles/key-child-care-texts/the-cleveland-reportby-judge-elizabeth-butler-sloss The Cleveland Report] digest by Robert Shaw, Children Webmag 2011, accessed July 17, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

On 14 October 1991, the [[Children Act 1989]] was implemented in full as a result of the Cleveland child abuse scandal&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Pragnall|first1=Charles|title=Torn from their mothers' arms What are social workers for?

{{neuropsychology}}
'''Cognitive neuropsychology''' is a branch of [[cognitive psychology]] that aims to understand how the structure and function of the [[brain]] relates to specific [[psychological]] processes. Cognitive psychology is the science that looks at how mental processes are responsible for our cognitive abilities to store and produce new memories, produce language, recognize people and objects, as well as our ability to reason and problem solve. Cognitive neuropsychology places a particular emphasis on studying the [[cognitive]] effects of [[acquired brain injury|brain injury]] or [[neurological illness]] with a view to inferring models of normal [[cognitive]] functioning. Evidence is based on case studies of individual brain damaged patients who show deficits in brain areas and from patients who exhibit [[double dissociation]]s. Double dissociations involve two patients and two tasks. One patient is impaired at one task but normal on the other, while the other patient is normal on the first task and impaired on the other. For example, patient A would be poor at reading printed words while still being normal at understanding spoken words, while the patient B would be normal at understanding written words and be poor at understanding spoken words. Scientists can interpret this information to explain how there is a single cognitive module for word comprehension. From studies like these, researchers infer that different areas of the brain are highly specialised. Cognitive neuropsychology can be distinguished from [[cognitive neuroscience]], which is also interested in brain damaged patients, but is particularly focused on uncovering the neural mechanisms underlying cognitive processes.&lt;ref name="Schater 2000"&gt;{{cite book |quote=The term cognitive neuropsychology often connotes a purely functional approach to patients with cognitive deficits that does not make use of, or encourage interest in, evidence and ideas about brain systems and processes |first=Daniel L. |last1=Schacter |chapter=Understanding Implicit memory: A cognitive neuroscience approach |editor-first=M.S. |editor-last=Gazzaniga |title=Cognitive Neuroscience: A Reader |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=99q2QgAACAAJ |year=2000 |publisher=Wiley |isbn=978-0-631-21659-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[Image:Phineas gage - 1868 skull diagram.jpg|right|200px|thumb|"''Front and lateral view of the cranium, representing the direction in which the iron traversed its cavity...''"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Harlow |first=John Martyn |year=1868 |title=Recovery from the Passage of an Iron Bar through the Head |url=https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Index:Recovery_from_the_passage_of_an_iron_bar_through_the_head.djvu}} Originally published in {{cite journal |work=Publications of the Massachusetts Medical Society |volume=2 |pages=327–347}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Cognitive neuropsychology has its roots in the diagram making approach to [[language disorders|language disorder]] that started in the second half of the 19th century. The discovery that [[aphasia]] took different forms depending on the location of brain damage provided a powerful framework for understanding brain function.&lt;ref name="Coltheart, M. 2008"&gt;Coltheart, M. (2008). Cognitive neuropsychology. Scholarpedia, 3(2), 3644. doi: 10.4249/scholarpedia.3644&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1861 [[Paul Broca]], reported a [[post-mortem examination|post mortem]] study of an [[aphasia|aphasic]] patient who was speechless apart from a single nonsense word:  "Tan". Broca showed that an area of the left [[frontal lobe]] was damaged. As Tan was unable to produce speech but could still understand it, Broca argued that this area might be specialised for speech production and that [[language]] skills might be localized to this [[cerebral cortex|cortical]] area. Broca did a similar study on another patient, Lelong, a few weeks later. Lelong, like Tan, could understand speech but could only repeat the same 5 words. After examining his brain, Broca noticed that Lelong had a lesion in approximately the same area as his patient Tan. He also noticed that in the more than 25 patients he examined with [[aphasia]], they all had lesions to the left frontal lobe but there was no damage to the right hemisphere of the brain. From this he concluded that the function of speech was probably localized in the inferior frontal gyrus of the left hemisphere of the brain, an area now known as [[Broca's area]].

[[Karl Wernicke]] subsequently reported patients with damage further back in the temporal lobe who could speak but were unable to understand what was said to them, providing evidence for two potentially interconnected language centres. These clinical descriptions were integrated into a theory of language organisation by [[Ludwig Lichtheim|Lichtheim]].&lt;ref&gt;Carlson, Neil R. (2013). Physiology of Behavior. NJ, U.S: Pearson Education, Inc., p. 132.&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, these models were used and developed to inform [[Joseph Jules Dejerine|Dejerine's]] account of reading, [[Liepmann]]'s theory of action and [[Lissauer]]'s 1890 account of object recognition  and [[Lewandowsky]] and Stadelmann's 1908 account of calculation.
[[Image:BrocasAreaSmall.png|thumb|left|200px|Broca's area and Wernicke's area.]]
However, the early 20th century saw a reaction to the overly-precise accounts of the diagram making neurologists. [[Pierre Marie]] challenged  conclusions against previous evidence of Broca's areas in 1906 and [[Henry Head]] attacked the whole field of cerebral localisation 1926.

The modern science of cognitive neuropsychology emerged during the 1960s stimulated by the insights of the neurologist [[Norman Geschwind]] who demonstrated that the insights of Broca and Wernicke were still clinically relevant. The other stimulus to the discipline was the "Cognitive Revolution" and the growing science of [[cognitive psychology]] which had emerged as a reaction to [[behaviorism]] in the mid 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, G. A. (2003). The cognitive revolution: a historical perspective. Trends in Cognitive Sciences, 7(3), 141-144. doi: 10.1016/s1364-6613(03)00029-9.&lt;/ref&gt;
Psychologists in the mid-1950s acknowledged that the structure of mental information-processing systems could be investigated in scientifically acceptable ways. They developed and applied new cognitive processing models to explain experimental data from not only studies of speech and language but also those of selective attention.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Coltheart, M. (2008). Cognitive neuropsychology. Scholarpedia, 3(2), 3644. doi: 10.4249/scholarpedia.3644.&lt;/ref&gt; Cognitive psychologists and clinical neuropsychologists developed more research collaborations to gain a better understanding of these disorders. The rebirth of neuropsychology was marked by the publishing of two seminal collaborative papers from Marshall &amp; Newcombe (1966) on reading and Warrington &amp; Shallice (1969) on memory.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Subsequently, work by pioneers such as [[Elizabeth Warrington]], [[Brenda Milner]], [[Tim Shallice]], [[Alan Baddeley]] and [[Lawrence Weiskrantz]] demonstrated that neurological patients were an important source of data for cognitive psychologists.

It took less than one decade for neuropsychology to be fully re-established. More achievements in neuropsychology were recognized: the establishment of the first major book discussing neuropsychology using a cognitive approach, ''Deep Dyslexia'', in 1980 after a scientific meeting about the topic in Oxford in 1977, the birth of the ''Cognitive Neuropsychology'' journal in 1984, and the publishing of the first textbook of neuropsychology, ''Human Cognitive Neuropsychology'' in 1988.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

A particular area of interest  was memory. Patients with [[amnesia]] caused by injuries to the [[hippocampus]]  in the temporal cortex and midbrain areas (especially the [[mamillary bodies]] were of early interest. A patient with severe case of amnesia will not be able to remember meeting the examiner if they leave the room and return, let alone events of the previous day ([[episodic memory]]), but they will still be able to learn how to tie their shoes ([[procedural memory]]), remember a series of numbers for a few seconds ([[short term memory]] or [[working memory]]) and be able to recall historical events they have learned in school ([[semantic memory]]). By contrast, patients may lose their short term memory abilities while retaining their long term memory functions.  Many other studies like this have been done in the field of neuropsychology examining lesions and the effect they have on certain areas of the brain and their functions.

[[Image:Hippolobes.gif|left|thumb|300px|Most of Molaison's hippocampus was removed bilaterally.]]
Studies on the amnesic patient [[Henry Molaison]], formerly known as patient H.M., are commonly cited as some of the precursors, if not the beginning of modern cognitive neuropsychology. Molaison had parts of his medial temporal lobes surgically removed to treat intractable [[epilepsy]] in 1953. Much of the hippocampus was also removed along with the medial temporal lobes. The treatment proved successful in reducing his dangerous [[seizure]]s, but left him with a profound but selective amnesia. After the surgery, Molaison was able to remember some big events from before the surgery, such as the stock market crash in 1929, but was confused about many others and could no longer form new memories. This accidental experiment showed scientists how the brain processes different types of memory. Because Molaison's impairment was caused by surgery, the damaged parts of his brain were known, information which was usually not knowable in a time before accurate [[neuroimaging]] became widespread. Scientists concluded that while the hippocampus is needed in the creation of new memories, it is not needed in the retrieval of old ones; they are two separate processes. They also realized that the hippocampus and the medial temporal lobes, both of the areas removed from Molaison, are the areas responsible for converting short term memory to long term memory.

Much of the early work of cognitive neuropsychology was carried out with limited reference to the detailed localisation of brain pathology. [[Neuroimaging]] was relatively imprecise and other anatomically based techniques were also limited. The emphasis of many researchers as late as 1990 was on the analysis of patterns of cognitive deficit rather than on where the injury was located.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shallice|first1=Tim|title=From Neuropsychology to Mental Structure|date=October 2009|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780511526817}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the lack of detailed anatomical data, studies of reading, language and memory had a number of important implications. The first is that certain [[cognitive]] processes (such as language) could be damaged separately from others, and so might be handled by distinct and independent cognitive (and neural) processes. (For more on the cognitive neuropsychological approach to language, see [[Eleanor Saffran]], among others.) The second is that such processes might be localized to specific areas of the brain. Whilst both of these claims are still controversial to some degree, the influence led to a focus on brain injury as a potentially fruitful way of understanding the relationship between [[psychology]] and [[neuroscience]].

==Methods==
A key approach within cognitive neuropsychology has been to use single case studies and [[Dissociation (neuropsychology)|dissociation]] as a means of testing theories of cognitive function. For example, if a theory states that reading and writing are simply different skills stemming from a single cognitive process, it should not be possible to find a person who, after brain injury, can write but not read or read but not write. This selective breakdown in skills suggests that different parts of the brain are specialized for the different processes and so the cognitive systems are separable.

The philosopher [[Jerry Fodor]] has been particularly influential in cognitive neuropsychology, particularly with the idea that the mind, or at least certain parts of it, may be organised into independent modules. Evidence that cognitive skills may be damaged independently seem to support this theory to some degree, although it is clear that some aspects of mind (such as [[belief]] for example) are unlikely to be modular. Fodor, a strict [[functionalism (philosophy of mind)|functionalist]], rejects the idea that the neurological properties of the brain have any bearing on its cognitive properties and doubts the whole discipline of cognitive neuropsychology.

With improved neuroimaging techniques, it has been possible to correlate patterns of impairment with a knowledge of exactly which parts of the [[nervous system]] are damaged, allowing previously undiscovered functional relationships to be explored (the ''[[lesion]] method''). Contemporary cognitive neuropsychology uses many of the same techniques and technologies from the wider science of [[neuropsychology]] and fields such as [[cognitive neuroscience]]. These may include [[neuroimaging]], [[electrophysiology]] and [[neuropsychological tests]] to measure either brain function or psychological performance. Useful technology in cognitive neuropsychology includes positron-emission tomography (PET) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). These techniques make it possible to identify the areas of the brain responsible for performing certain cognitive tasks by measuring blood flow in the brain. PET scans sense the low-level radiation in the brain and produce 3-D images, whereas an fMRI works on a magnetic signal and is used to “map the brain”. Electroencephalography (EEG) records the brain’s electrical activity and can identify changes that occur over milliseconds. EEG is often used in patients with epilepsy to detect seizure activity.

The principles of cognitive neuropsychology have recently been applied to [[mental illness]], with a view to understanding, for example, what the study of [[delusion]]s may tell us about the function of normal belief. This relatively young field is known as [[cognitive neuropsychiatry]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5347">In [[probability theory]], the '''craps principle''' is a theorem about [[Event (probability theory)|event]] [[probabilities]] under repeated [[Independent and identically-distributed random variables|iid]] trials. Let &lt;math&gt;E_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;E_2&lt;/math&gt; denote two [[mutually exclusive]] events which might occur on a given trial. Then the probability that &lt;math&gt;E_1&lt;/math&gt; occurs before &lt;math&gt;E_2&lt;/math&gt; equals the [[conditional probability]] that &lt;math&gt;E_1&lt;/math&gt; occurs given that &lt;math&gt;E_1&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;E_2&lt;/math&gt; occur on the next trial, which is

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{P}[ E_1 \, \, \text{before}\,\, E_2]=\operatorname{P}\left[E_1\mid E_1\cup E_2\right]=\frac{\operatorname{P}[E_1]}{\operatorname{P}[E_1]+\operatorname{P}[E_2]}&lt;/math&gt;

The events &lt;math&gt;E_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;E_2&lt;/math&gt; need not be [[collectively exhaustive]] (if they are, the result is trivial).&lt;ref name="stat_TheC"&gt;{{Cite web| title = The Craps principle 10/16| author = Susan Holmes| work = statweb.stanford.edu| date = 1998-12-07| accessdate = 2016-03-17| url = http://statweb.stanford.edu/~susan/courses/s116/node63.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ouellette2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jennifer Ouellette|title=The Calculus Diaries: How Math Can Help You Lose Weight, Win in Vegas, and Survive a Zombie Apocalypse|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fQzJoqBwtT4C&amp;pg=PT50|date=31 August 2010|publisher=Penguin Publishing Group|isbn=978-1-101-45903-4|pages=50–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Proof==
Let &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; be the event that &lt;math&gt;E_1&lt;/math&gt; occurs before &lt;math&gt;E_2&lt;/math&gt;. Let &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; be the event that neither &lt;math&gt;E_1&lt;/math&gt; nor &lt;math&gt;E_2&lt;/math&gt; occurs on a given trial. Since &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;E_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;E_2&lt;/math&gt; are [[mutually exclusive]] and [[collectively exhaustive]] for the first trial, we have

:&lt;math&gt; \operatorname{P}(A) = \operatorname{P}(E_1)\operatorname{P}(A \mid E_1) + \operatorname{P}(E_2)\operatorname{P}(A \mid E_2) + \operatorname{P}(B) \operatorname{P}(A \mid B) = \operatorname{P}(E_1) + \operatorname{P}(B) \operatorname{P}(A \mid B)&lt;/math&gt;

and &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{P}(B) = 1 - \operatorname{P}(E_1) - \operatorname{P}(E_2)&lt;/math&gt;. 
Since the trials are i.i.d., we have &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{P}(A \mid B) = \operatorname{P}(A)&lt;/math&gt;. Using &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{P}(A|E_1)=1,\quad \operatorname{P}(A|E_2)=0&lt;/math&gt; and solving the displayed equation for &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{P}(A)&lt;/math&gt; gives the formula 
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{P}(A) = \frac{\operatorname{P}(E_1)}{\operatorname{P}(E_1)+\operatorname{P}(E_2)}&lt;/math&gt;.

==Application==

If the trials are repetitions of a game between two players, and the events are

:&lt;math&gt;E_1:\mathrm{ player\ 1\ wins}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;E_2:\mathrm{ player\ 2\ wins}&lt;/math&gt;

then the craps principle gives the respective conditional probabilities of each player winning a certain repetition, given that someone wins (i.e., given that a [[draw (tie)|draw]] does not occur). In fact, the result is only affected by the relative marginal probabilities of winning &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{P}[E_1]&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{P}[E_2]&lt;/math&gt; ; in particular, the probability of a draw is irrelevant.

===Stopping===
If the game is played repeatedly until someone wins, then the conditional probability above is the probability that the player wins the game. This is illustrated below for the original game of [[craps]], using an alternative proof.

==Craps example==
If the game being played is [[craps]], then this principle can greatly simplify the computation of the probability of winning in a certain scenario. Specifically, if the first roll is a 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, or 10, then the dice are repeatedly re-rolled until one of two events occurs:
:&lt;math&gt;E_1:\text{ the original roll (called ‘the point’) is rolled (a win) }&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;E_2:\text{ a 7 is rolled (a loss) }&lt;/math&gt;

Since &lt;math&gt;E_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;E_2&lt;/math&gt; are mutually exclusive, the craps principle applies. For example, if the original roll was a 4, then the probability of winning is

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{3/36}{3/36 + 6/36}=\frac{1}{3}&lt;/math&gt;

This avoids having to sum the [[infinite series]] corresponding to all the possible outcomes:

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=0}^{\infty}\operatorname{P}[\text{first i rolls are ties,}(i+1)^{\text{th}}\text{roll is ‘the point’}]&lt;/math&gt;

Mathematically, we can express the probability of rolling &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; ties followed by rolling the point:

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{P}[\text{first i rolls are ties, }(i+1)^{\text{th}} \text{roll is ‘the point’}]
 = (1-\operatorname{P}[E_1]-\operatorname{P}[E_2])^i\operatorname{P}[E_1]
&lt;/math&gt;

The summation becomes an infinite [[geometric series]]:

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=0}^{\infty} (1-\operatorname{P}[E_1]-\operatorname{P}[E_2])^i\operatorname{P}[E_1]
= \operatorname{P}[E_1] \sum_{i=0}^{\infty} (1-\operatorname{P}[E_1]-\operatorname{P}[E_2])^i
&lt;/math&gt;

::&lt;math&gt; = \frac{\operatorname{P}[E_1]}{1-(1-\operatorname{P}[E_1]-\operatorname{P}[E_2])}
= \frac{\operatorname{P}[E_1]}{\operatorname{P}[E_1]+\operatorname{P}[E_2]}
&lt;/math&gt;

which agrees with the earlier result.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11247">{{For|the crown rabbi in Spain and Portugal in the Middle Ages|Crown rabbi (Iberia)}}
'''Crown rabbi''' ({{lang-rus|казённый раввин|p=kɐˈzʲɵnːɨj rɐˈvʲːin|t=official rabbi}}) was a position in the [[Russian Empire]] given to a member of a [[Russian Jews|Jewish community]] appointed to act as an intermediary between his community and the Imperial government, to perform certain civil duties such as registering births, marriages, and divorces.  Because their main job qualification was fluency in [[Russian language|Russian]], crown rabbis were typically considered agents of the state by members of their own communities, not true [[rabbi]]s, and they often had no education in or knowledge of [[Jewish law]].

== History ==

The origins of the crown rabbinate in [[Imperial Russia]] date to the early 19th century and administrative requirements by the [[tsar]] that the Jewish community maintain and provide civil records to the Imperial government in the [[Russian language]].&lt;ref name="kehila"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://kehilalinks.jewishgen.org/lyakhovichi/rabbonim.htm |title=Rabbonim, Rebbes, and Crown Rabbis of Lyakhovichi-An Original Publication of Lyakovichi Shtetl Website |last1=Glassman |first1=Deborah |date=December 2004 |website=jewishgen.org |publisher=Jewish Gen, Inc. |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150222181250/http://kehilalinks.jewishgen.org/lyakhovichi/Rabbonim.htm |archivedate=2015-02-22 |accessdate=2015-05-31 |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religion as agent of the state===

The Russian government viewed all permissible religions as agents of the state.  [[Russian Orthodox]] priests, [[Mennonite]] ministers, [[Roman Catholic|Catholics]] as well as Jewish rabbis{{ndash}}were all required to perform certain civil duties such as registering births, deaths, and marriages, as well as other duties.  The Russians found this arrangement useful, and employed designated members of these religious communities at a tiny salary (which could be augmented by bribes by the ambitious) to perform these official functions.&lt;ref name="kehila" /&gt;

===Language requirements under Alexander I===

[[Ukase]]s by [[Tsar Alexander I]] (reigned 1801{{ndash}}1825) required the rabbis to maintain civil information in [[Russian language|Russian]] as well as Hebrew.  [[Rabbis]] in the Empire all spoke [[Hebrew]] and [[Yiddish]], but few could speak Russian or other languages considered useful by the Empire such as German and Polish.  For this reason, the Jewish communities chose an individual familiar with Russian and other required languages to perform this role, and put his name forward.  If approved by the governmental administration, they became "official" rabbis, in the sense that they acted as the intermediary between their community and the Imperial government for the required civil and other administrative duties the government required of them.&lt;ref name="Kaplan2010"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |encyclopedia=The YIVO Encyclopedia of Jews in Eastern Europe |editor-last1=Kaplan Appel |editor-first1=Tamar |editor-link1= |title=Crown Rabbi |last1= |first1= |author-link1= |url=http://www.yivoencyclopedia.org/article.aspx/Crown_Rabbi |date=3 August 2010 |publisher=Yale University Press |location= |edition= |series= |volume= |isbn=9780300119039 |oclc=170203576 |pages= |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150327120806/http://www.yivoencyclopedia.org/article.aspx/Crown_Rabbi |archivedate=2015-03-27 |accessdate=2015-05-31 |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since rabbis most often did not speak Russian, the men put forth by the community typically were men who were not rabbis, and often they were not even particularly familiar with Jewish law.  Because of this, they were looked down upon by their communities as agents or puppets of the government, and not real rabbis, despite the title accorded them by the state.&lt;ref name="Berlin-2011"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |encyclopedia=The Oxford Dictionary of the Jewish Religion |editor-last1=Berlin |editor-first1=Adele |editor-link=Adele Berlin |last=Himelstein |first=Shmuel |title=Crown Rabbi |edition=2nd |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hKAaJXvUaUoC&amp;pg=PA195 |date=2011 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford; New York |volume= |isbn=978-0-19-973004-9 |language= |trans-title= |quote= }} p. 195&lt;/ref&gt;

===Evolution under Nicholas I===

This new position became more formalized under [[Tsar Nicholas I]] (reigned 1825{{ndash}}1855). In 1835, new laws established these appointees as employees and officials of the Imperial government.  While continuing their record-keeping duties as before, they were also now given religious authority by the state and were also to maintain loyalty to the state among their community.  It was under these new regulations that those occupying these official posts came to be called "crown rabbis".&lt;ref name="Kaplan2010" /&gt;

===Choosing a crown rabbi===

A crown rabbi was either appointed, or elected by members of the Jewish community in which he resided.  In Kiev, shortly after Jewish residents were permitted to settle in the city in 1861, a crown rabbi was appointed.  But the local community objected, and wished to elect someone with the education and stature that they could respect, and elected their own man, Evsei Tsukkerman, instead.  He was then approved by the government, and took up the position of crown rabbi.&lt;ref name="Meir-2010"&gt;{{cite book |last=Meir |first=Natan M |date=2010 |orig-year= |title=Kiev, Jewish Metropolis: A History, 1859--1914 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8Sc-UJsKq8gC&amp;dq |page=86  |location=[[Bloomington, IN]] |publisher=[[Indiana University Press]] |isbn=0253004330 |series=Kiev, Jewish Metropolis |doi=10.1080/09546545.2012.671454 |oclc=649479079 |access-date=2015-06-01 |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===State seminaries===

The crown rabbinate evolved, and by mid-century the government opened its own seminaries for training rabbis (supported by taxes on Jewish  communities) with a strong secular syllabus promoting the interests of the state.  The training was seven years undergraduate, followed by three years training in pedagogy or rabbinical studies.  Secular subjects were mandatory; the syllabus did include Rabbinic training ([[Talmud]], [[halakha]]) at the graduate level, but was optional and few graduates took it.&lt;ref name="Kaplan2010" /&gt;

The first graduates emerged in the 1850s, and by the following decade, new laws were passed obliging the Jewish communities to hire these graduates, although there was a lot of resistance to them as they were viewed as poorly or uneducated in Jewish matters important to the community, and a bad influence because of their years of secular indoctrination.  Few graduates found positions, and the number of them graduating went down to a trickle.  Finally, the government closed the schools down in 1873, realizing that the Jewish community regarded them as unfit for the honored position of rabbi.  The position of crown rabbi outlasted the schools, and while the government viewed the crown rabbis as being the only official rabbis, the communities continued to have rabbis schooled in the traditional ways, with the result that many communities had two rabbis, an "official" one for dealing with the Tsar, and a "spiritual" rabbi for dealing with all the traditional religious and family roles that rabbis usually dealt with.  The official rabbis were universally viewed as agents of the state by the Jewish communities.&lt;ref name="Kaplan2010" /&gt;

===The dual rabbinate===

The problem of the "dual rabbinate" continued until the 20th century and [[World War I]], with debates raging within the community itself about how to view and react to the situation.  The Orthodox accepted only their traditional spiritual rabbis as legitimate, while progressive Jews thought that rabbis should also play a role in secular concerns such as social, economic, and intellectual aspects of their communities.  Crown rabbis continued to perform their official duties all during this debate, and attended various Russian Rabbinic Congresses, such as the one in 1910.&lt;ref name="Kaplan2010" /&gt;

At the 1910 Rabinic conference the objective was to get rid of the Crown Rabbinate entirely, but this ran into problems because the Orthodox delegates by and large refused to encourage or require their (legitimate, spiritual, educated) rabbis to take on the administrative tasks fulfilled by the crown rabbis because that would require their learning Russian and to submit to the licensing authority of the Russian state which was far too much in the secular domain for an Orthodox rabbi to go.  This caused a split among the delegates among those who saw nothing wrong with learning Russian and even thought it would avoid much of the misery the Jews had undergone, however this resulted in a stalemate and no new decisions were taken about it.&lt;ref name="Wert-2004"&gt;{{cite book |editor=Jack Wertheimer |date=2004-03-20 |title=Jewish Religious Leadership: In Eastern Europe ; In Western and Central Europe ; In the United States ; In North Africa and Israel ; The representation of Jewish leadership |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PvUlAQAAIAAJ |volume=II |page=431 |chapter=Reflections on the Russian Rabbinate |last=Stanislawski |first=Michael |publisher=Jewish Theological Seminary |isbn=9780873340984 |doi= |oclc= |access-date=2015-06-02 |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9156">[[File:Die Gedanken sind frei.png|thumb|upright=1.3|"{{Lang|de|Die Gedanken sind frei|italic=no}}". Hoffmann von Fallersleben, Ernst Heinrich Leopold Richter, ''Schlesische Volkslieder mit Melodien'', 1842]]
"'''{{Lang|de|Die Gedanken sind frei|italic=no}}'''" (Thoughts are free) is a German song about the [[freedom of thought]]. The original lyricist and the composer are unknown, though the most popular version was rendered by [[August Heinrich Hoffmann von Fallersleben|Hoffmann von Fallersleben]] in 1842.

==Text==
The idea represented in the title—that thoughts are free—was expressed as early as in [[classical antiquity|antiquity]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Cicero]]: {{Lang|la|Liberae sunt}} (...) {{Lang|la|nostrae cogitationes}}, ("Free are our thoughts") ''[[Pro Milone]]'', XXIX. 79., 52 BC&lt;/ref&gt; and became prominent again in the [[Middle Ages]], when [[Walther von der Vogelweide]] (c.1170–1230) wrote: {{Lang|de|joch sint iedoch gedanke frî}} ("yet still thoughts are free").&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.univie.ac.at/elib/index.php?title=Der_Keiser_als_Spileman_%28Walther_von_der_Vogelweide%29 "Der Keiser als Spileman"], Walther von der Vogelweide&lt;/ref&gt; In the 12th century, it is thought that [[Archduchy of Austria|Austrian]] [[minnesinger]] [[Dietmar von Aist]] composed the song "{{Lang|de|Gedanke die sint ledic vrî||italic=no}}" ("only thoughts are free"). About 1229, [[Freidank]] wrote: {{Lang|de|diu bant mac nieman vinden, diu mîne gedanke binden}} ("this band may no one twine, that will my thoughts confine").

The text as it first occurred on leaflets about 1780 originally had four [[strophe]]s, to which a fifth was later added. Today, their order may vary. An early version in the shape of a dialogue between a captive and his beloved was published under the title "{{Lang|de|Lied des Verfolgten im Thurm. Nach Schweizerliedern|italic=no}}" ("Song of the persecuted in the tower. After Swiss songs") in [[Achim von Arnim]] and [[Clemens Brentano]]'s circa 1805 folk poetry collection {{Lang|de|[[Des Knaben Wunderhorn]]}}, Vol. III.

The text and the melody can be found in {{Lang|de|Lieder der Brienzer Mädchen}} (songs of the girls from [[Brienz]]), printed in [[Bern]], Switzerland, between 1810 and 1820. It was adopted by Hoffmann von Fallersleben in his {{Lang|de|Schlesische Volkslieder mit Melodien}} ([[Silesia]]n folk songs with melodies) collection published by [[Breitkopf &amp; Härtel]] in 1842, who referred to it as "from [[Nowy Kościół|Neukirch bei Schönau]]".

== Lyrics ==
{|
|&lt;poem&gt;{{Lang|de|{{Noitalic|1.}} Die Gedanken sind frei, wer kann sie erraten,
sie fliegen vorbei wie nächtliche Schatten.
Kein Mensch kann sie wissen, kein Jäger sie schießen
mit Pulver und Blei: Die Gedanken sind frei!

{{Noitalic|2.}} Ich denke was ich will und was mich beglücket,
doch alles in der Still', und wie es sich schicket.
Mein Wunsch und Begehren kann niemand verwehren,
es bleibet dabei: Die Gedanken sind frei!

{{Noitalic|3.}} Und sperrt man mich ein im finsteren Kerker,
das alles sind rein vergebliche Werke.
Denn meine Gedanken zerreißen die Schranken
und Mauern entzwei: Die Gedanken sind frei!

{{Noitalic|4.}} Drum will ich auf immer den Sorgen entsagen
und will mich auch nimmer mit Grillen mehr plagen.
Man kann ja im Herzen stets lachen und scherzen
und denken dabei: Die Gedanken sind frei!

{{Noitalic|5.}} Ich liebe den Wein, mein Mädchen vor allen,
sie tut mir allein am besten gefallen.
Ich sitz nicht alleine bei meinem Glas Weine,
mein Mädchen dabei: Die Gedanken sind frei!}}&lt;/poem&gt;
|style="padding-left:2em;"|&lt;poem&gt;1. Thoughts are free, who can guess them?
They fly by like nocturnal shadows.
No person can know them, no hunter can shoot them
with powder and lead: Thoughts are free!

2. I think what I want, and what delights me,
still always reticent, and as it is suitable.
My wish and desire, no one can deny me
and so it will always be: Thoughts are free!

3. And if I am thrown into the darkest dungeon,
all these are futile works,
because my thoughts tear all gates
and walls apart: Thoughts are free!

4. So I will renounce my sorrows forever,
and never again will torture myself with whimsies.
In one's heart, one can always laugh and joke
and think at the same time: Thoughts are free!

5. I love wine, and my girl even more,
Only her I like best of all.
I'm not alone with my glass of wine,
my girl is with me: Thoughts are free!&lt;/poem&gt;

==Adaptations==
Since the days of the [[Carlsbad Decrees]] and the [[Age of Metternich]], "Die Gedanken sind frei" was a popular [[protest song]] against [[political repression]] and [[censorship]], especially among the banned [[Burschenschaft]]en student fraternities. In the aftermath of the failed [[The Revolutions of 1848 in the German states|1848 German Revolution]] the song was banned. The Achim/Brentano text was given a new musical setting for voice and orchestra by [[Gustav Mahler]] in his 1898 ''[[Des Knaben Wunderhorn (Mahler)|Des Knaben Wunderhorn]]'' collection.

The song was important to certain anti-Nazi [[German resistance|resistance]] movements in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;Melon, Ruth Bernadette. ''Journey to the White Rose in Germany''. Dog Ear Publishing, 2007. {{ISBN|1-59858-249-6}}. p. 122.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1942, [[Sophie Scholl]], a member of the [[White Rose]] resistance group, played the song on her flute outside the walls of [[Ulm]] prison, where her father Robert had been detained for calling the Nazi dictator [[Adolf Hitler]] a "scourge of God". Earlier, in 1935, the guards at the [[Lichtenburg (concentration camp)|Lichtenburg concentration camp]] had ordered prisoners to stage a performance in celebration of Hitler's 46th birthday; the imprisoned communist-friendly lawyer [[Hans Litten]] recited "Die Gedanken sind frei" in response.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Hans Litten: The man who annoyed Adolf Hitler|author=Jon Kelly|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-14572578|accessdate=19 August 2011|publisher=BBC News|date=19 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[The Weavers]] recorded the song at a live concert in the 1950s.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}} [[Pete Seeger]] also recorded the song, solo, back in the 1950s.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}} [[The Limeliters]] recorded the song in 1962 on their ''Folk Matinee'' album.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}} Pete Seeger recorded the song once more in his ''[[Dangerous Songs!?]]'' album in 1966. Norwegian composer [[Alf Cranner]] translated and recorded it as "{{Lang|no|Din tanke er fri|italic=no}}" in 1985.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}} Parts of the poem were also taken as the basis of a song by the [[Brazilian Girls]] on their [[Brazilian Girls (album)|self-titled 2005 album]].

==In popular culture==

"Die Gedanken sind frei" was used as the theme and was sung by the Allied prisoners of war in the 1971 TV movie ''[[The Birdmen]]'', which was a fictionalized dramatization of an attempt to escape from the German [[Oflag IV-C]] camp at [[Colditz Castle]] in World War II. It was featured in the 1998 German movie [[23 (film)|''23'']] about the hacker [[Karl Koch (hacker)|Karl Koch]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}} This melody was played by a violinist in the film ''[[The Book Thief (film)|The Book Thief]]''.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}

In Canadian author [[Jean Little]]'s 1972 book ''[[From Anna]]'' the song is used to represent the freedom the titular character's father craves for his children, and as such figures predominantly into the plot at the beginning of the novel.

"Die Gedanken sind frei" is a track by the German band [[Megaherz]] on their ''[[Wer Bist Du?]]'' album.

The text of "Die Gedanken sind frei" has been used in the video game [[Orwell (video game)|Orwell]] as a plot device.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8760">In East Asian Buddhism the Buddha of the [[Lotus Sutra]] is regarded as the '''eternal Buddha'''. It is a popular notion, which may have contributed to the [[tathagatagarbha]] doctrine, although the notion of an ''eternal Buddha'' is not explicitly stated in the Lotus Sutra.

The belief in the Eternal Buddha transcends through time and is commonly associated with [[Shakyamuni Buddha]], but can also refer to both his past and future incarnations. However, no exact definition of the ''Eternal Buddha'' is defined in the Lotus Sutra, which was also revealed by [[Siddhartha Gautama]]; thereby making open interpretations to various religious groups.

==Lotus Sutra and tathagatagarbha doctrine==

In east-Asian Buddhism, the Buddha of the [[Lotus Sutra]] is regarded as the eternal Buddha.{{sfn|Williams|2008|p=157}} "The Tathagata´s Lifespan" chapter (ch 16) of the [[Lotus Sutra]] portrays the Buddha as indicating that he became awakened countless aeons ("kalpas") ago.{{sfn|Pye|1978|p=50}}  The sutra itself, however, does not directly employ the phrase "eternal Buddha".{{source?|date=July 2015}} 

In China the ''Lotus Sutra'' was associated with the ''[[Nirvana Sutra|Mahaparinirvana Sutra]]'', which propagates the [[Buddha-nature|tathagatagarbha-doctrine]], and with the ''[[Awakening of Faith]]''.{{sfn|Williams|2008|p=157}} The Mahaparinirvana Sutra presents the Buddha as eternal, and equates him with the [[Trikaya|Dharmakaya]].{{sfn|Xing|2005|p=89}}{{refn|group=note|Commenting on the Mahayana Mahaparinirvana Sutra, Guang Xing writes: "One of the main themes of the ''Mahayana Mahaparinirvana Sutra'' is that the Buddha is eternal, a theme very much in contrast with the Hinayana idea that the Buddha departed for ever after his final nirvana. The Mahayanists assert the eternity of the Buddha in two ways in the ''Mahaparinirvana Sutra''. They state that the Buddha is the ''dharmakaya'', and hence eternal. Next, they re-interpret the liberation of the Buddha as ''mahaparinirvana'' possessing four attributes: eternity, happiness, self and purity. In other words, according to the Mahayanists, the fact that the Buddha abides in the ''mahaparinirvana'' means not that he has departed for ever, but that he perpetually abides in intrinsic quiescence. The Buddha abiding in intrinsic quiescence is none other than the ''dharmakaya'' [...] This ''dharmakaya'' is the ''real'' Buddha. It is on this doctrinal foundation that the ''Mahaparinirvana Sutra'' declares: "the dharmakaya has [the attributes of] eternity (''nitya''), happiness (''sukha''), self (''atman'') and purity (''subha'') and is perpetually free from birth, old age, sickness, death and all other sufferings [...] It exists eternally without change.""{{sfn|Xing|2005|p=89}}}} 

The ''Lotus Sutra'' itself does hardly seem to accept the tathagatagarbha-teachings.{{sfn|Williams|2008|p=157}} According to Paul Williams, this association may be explained by the systematization of the ''Lotus Sutra'' teachings by the Tiantai school, using teachings from other schools "to equate the Buddha of the ''Lotus Sutra'' with the ultimate truth and to teach a cosmic Buddha."{{sfn|Williams|2008|p=157}}

==Understanding in east-Asian Buddhism==
===China===
The Chinese [[Tiantai]] scholar [[Zhiyi]] [天台] (538–597) divided the sutra into the "trace teaching" about the historical Shakyamuni Buddha (ch 1-14) and the "origin teaching" (ch 15-28) revealing the original Buddha of inconceivable life span.{{sfn|Fuss|1991|pp=29-30}}{{sfn|Leighton|2007|pp=29-30}}  
Zhiyi viewed Shakyamuni Buddha of Ch 16 of the Lotus Sutra as a unification of the [[Trikaya|three Buddha bodies]], possessing all three bodies, whereas other sutras are taught from the standpoint of a single Buddha body.{{sfn|Buswell|2013|p=473}}{{sfn|The English Buddhist Dictionary Committee|2009|p=}}

===Japan===
The [[Nichiren Shu]], [[Rissho Kosei Kai]] and [[Kempon Hokke]] schools of [[Nichiren Buddhism]] revere Shakyamuni of Chapter 16 of the [[Lotus Sutra]] as the eternal Buddha. They also regard Shakyamuni of Ch 16 as a "Unification of the Three Bodies", as taught by Tiantai.{{sfn|The English Buddhist Dictionary Committee|2009|p=}} Other Buddhas, such as Amida of the Pure Land (J. Nembutsu) School, and Mahavairochana of the True Word (J. Shingon) School are seen as provisional manifestations of the Original Buddha Shakyamuni.&lt;ref&gt;Nichiren Daishonin, Rissho Ankoku Ron (Eng. On Establishing the Correct Teaching for the Peace of the Land), 1260 CE&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Jōdo Shinshū|Shin]] or Pure Land Buddhism, [[Amitābha|Amida]] Buddha is viewed as the eternal Buddha who manifested as Shakyamuni in India and who is the personification of Nirvana itself.&lt;ref name=jodo&gt;[http://www.jodo.org/about_plb/what_plb.html What is Pure Land Buddhism?] da Sho-on Hattori, ''A Raft from The Other Shore Honen and the Way of Pure Land Buddhism'', published by Jodo Shu Press&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Amida, who attained Buddhahood in the infinite past, / Full of compassion for foolish beings of the five defilements, / Took the form of Sakyamuni Buddha/ And appeared in Gaya. (Shinran, Hymnes of Pure Land, 88)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Shingon Buddhism]] sees [[Vairochana Buddha]] as the personification of the dharmakaya, and hence as the eternal Buddha.{{source?|date=July 2015}}

To be in '''exile''' means to be away from one's home (i.e. city, state, or country), while either being explicitly refused permission to return or being threatened with imprisonment or death upon return.

In [[Roman law]], ''exsilium'' denoted both voluntary exile and banishment as a [[capital punishment]] alternative to death. [[Deportation]] was forced exile, and entailed the lifelong loss of citizenship and property. [[Relegation]] was a milder form of deportation, which preserved the subject's citizenship and property.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | author=[[William Smith (lexicographer)|William Smith]] | entry=BANISHMENT (ROMAN) | title=[[Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities]] | edition=3rd | year=1890 | pages=136-137}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The terms [[diaspora]] and [[refugee]] describe group exile, both voluntary and forced, and "[[government in exile]]" describes a government of a country that has relocated and argues its legitimacy from outside that country. Voluntary exile is often depicted as a form of protest by the person who claims it, to avoid persecution and prosecution (such as tax or criminal allegations), an act of shame or repentance, or isolating oneself to be able to devote time to a particular pursuit.

Article 9 of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] states that "No one shall be subjected to arbitrary arrest, detention or exile."

==For individuals==
=== Exiled heads of state ===
{{main|List of heads of state or government who have been in exile}}
In some cases the [[Deposition (politics)|deposed]] [[head of state]] is allowed to go into exile following a [[coup]] or other change of government, allowing a more peaceful transition to take place or to escape justice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Geoghegan |first=Tom |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-13052996 |title=BBC News - What happens to deposed leaders? |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=2011-04-14 |accessdate=2014-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Avoiding tax or legal matters ===
{{main|Tax exile|Fugitive}}
A wealthy citizen who moves to a jurisdiction with lower taxes is termed a ''tax exile''. Creative people such as authors and musicians who achieve sudden wealth sometimes choose this solution. Examples include the British-Canadian writer [[Arthur Hailey]], who moved to the Bahamas to avoid taxes following the runaway success of his novels ''Hotel'' and ''Airport'',&lt;ref&gt;Stevie Cameron, ''Blue Trust: The Author, The Lawyer, His Wife, And Her Money,'' 1998&lt;/ref&gt; and the English rock band the [[Rolling Stones]] who, in the spring of 1971, owed more in taxes than they could pay and left Britain before the government could seize their assets. Members of the band all moved to France for a period of time where they recorded music for the album that came to be called ''Exile on Main Street'', the Main Street of the title referring to the French Riviera.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Greenfield, ''Exile on Main Street: A Season in Hell with the Rolling Stones,'' 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, [[Eduardo Saverin]], one of the founders of Facebook, made headlines by renouncing his U.S. citizenship before his company's [[Initial Public Offering|IPO]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kucera|first=Danielle|title=Facebook Co-Founder Saverin Gives Up U.S. Citizenship Before IPO|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-05-11/facebook-co-founder-saverin-gives-up-u-s-citizenship-before-ipo.html|publisher=Bloomberg News|accessdate=2 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The dual Brazilian/U.S. citizen's decision to move to Singapore and renounce his citizenship spurred a bill in the U.S. Senate, the [[Ex-PATRIOT Act]], which would have forced such wealthy ''tax exiles'' to pay a special tax in order to re-enter the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Drawbaugh|first=Kevin|title=Facebook's Saverin fires back at tax-dodge critics|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/05/17/us-facebook-taxes-idUSBRE84G11A20120517|accessdate=2 November 2012|newspaper=Reuters|date=May 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some cases a person voluntarily lives in exile to avoid legal issues, such as [[litigation]] or [[criminal prosecution]]. An example of this is [[Asil Nadir]], who fled to the [[Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus]] for 17 years rather than face [[prosecution]] in connection with the failed £1.7 bn company [[Polly Peck]] in the [[United Kingdom]].

=== Avoiding violence or persecution, or in the aftermath of war ===
Examples include:
:* [[Iraq]]i academics asked to return home "from exile" to help rebuild Iraq in 2009&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://chronicle.com/article/Iraq-Appeals-Anew-to-Exiled/47791 |title=Iraq Appeals Anew to Exiled Academics to Return Home|first=Andrew |last=Mills |website=[[Reuters]] via chronicle.com |date=2009-06-23|accessdate=2011-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:* [[Jew]]s who fled persecution from [[Nazi Germany]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.thejc.com/news/uk-news/46415/libyan-exile-plan-uks-frozen-assets |title=Libyan exile plan for UK's frozen assets|first=Simon |last=Rocker |website=[[The Jewish Chronicle]] |date=2011-03-10 |accessdate=2011-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:* People undertaking a religious or [[civil liberties]] role in society may be forced into exile due to threat of persecution. For example, [[nun]]s were exiled following the [[Communism|Communist]] [[Czechoslovak coup d'état of 1948|coup d'état of 1948]] in [[Czechoslovakia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://articles.latimes.com/1990-01-20/news/mn-233_1_bila-voda |title=For Exiled Nuns, It's Too Late : Banished by the Communist regime, Czechoslovakia's sisters of Bila Voda were symbols of persecution.

==For groups, nations and governments==
===Comfortable Exile===
{{main|Social alienation|Identity (social science)}}
It is an alternative theory recently developed by a young anthropologist, Balan in 2018. According to him, comfortable exile is a “social exile of people who have been excluded from the mainstream society.  Such people are considered “aliens” or internal “others” on the grounds of their religious, racial, ethnic, linguistic or caste-based identity and therefore they migrate to a comfortable space elsewhere after having risked their lives to restore representation, identity and civil rights in their own country and often capture a comfortable identity to being part of a dominant religion, society or culture.” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Balan|first1=Binesh|title=Making of Comfortable Exile through Sanskritization: Reflections on Imagination of Identity Notions in India|journal=Contemporary Voice of Dalit, Sage Pub.|volume=10|issue=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nation in exile===
{{main|Diaspora|Refugee}}
When a large group, or occasionally a whole people or nation is exiled, it can be said that this nation is in exile, or "diaspora". Nations that have been in exile for substantial periods include the [[Jew]]s, who were deported by [[Babylon]]ian king [[Nebuchadnezzar II]] in 586 BC and again following the destruction of the second [[Temple in Jerusalem]] in AD 70. Many Jewish prayers include a yearning to return to Jerusalem and the Jewish homeland.

After the [[partitions of Poland]] in the late 18th century, and following the uprisings (like [[Kościuszko Uprising]], [[November Uprising]] and [[January Uprising]]) against the partitioning powers ([[Russian Empire]], [[Prussia]] and [[Austro-Hungary]]), many Poles have chosen&amp;nbsp;– or been forced&amp;nbsp;– to go into exile, forming large diasporas (known as [[Polish diaspora|Polonia]]), especially in France and the United States. The entire population of [[Crimean Tatars]] (200,000) that remained in their homeland [[Crimean Peninsula|Crimea]] was exiled on 18 May 1944 to Central Asia as a form of [[ethnic cleansing]] and [[collective punishment]] on false accusations. At [[Diego Garcia]], between 1967 and 1973 the British Government forcibly removed some 2,000 [[Chagossians|Chagossian]] resident islanders to make way for a military base today jointly operated by the US and UK.

Since the [[Cuban Revolution]] over one million [[Cubans]] have left [[Cuba]]. Most of these self-identify as exiles as their motivation for leaving the island is political in nature. It is to be noted that at the time of the [[Cuban Revolution]], [[Cuba]] only had a population of 6.5 million, and was not a country that had a history of significant emigration, it being the sixth largest recipient of immigrants in the world as of 1958. Most of the exiles' children also consider themselves to be [[Cuban exile]]s. It is to be noted that under Cuban law, children of Cubans born abroad are considered Cuban citizens.

===Government in exile===
{{main|Government in exile}}
During a foreign [[Military occupation|occupation]] or after a [[coup d'état]], a ''government in exile'' of a such afflicted country may be established abroad.  One of the most well-known instances of this is the [[Polish government-in-exile]], a government in exile that commanded [[Polish contribution to World War II|Polish armed forces]] operating outside Poland after German occupation during World War II. Other examples include the [[Free French Forces]] government of [[Charles De Gaulle]] of the same time, and the [[Central Tibetan Administration]], commonly known as the Tibetan government-in-exile, and headed by the [[14th Dalai Lama]].

== In popular culture ==
===Drama ===
[[File:Jason and Medea - John William Waterhouse.jpg|thumb|left|''[[Jason and Medea]]'', by [[John William Waterhouse]], 1907]]
[[File:Rama vanavas.jpg|thumb|Rama on the way]]

Exile is an early motif in [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] [[tragedy]]. In the ancient Greek world, this was seen as a fate worse than death. The motif reaches its peak on the play ''[[Medea (play)|Medea]]'', written by [[Euripides]] in the fifth century BC, and rooted in the very old oral traditions of  Greek mythology. Euripides’ [[Medea]] has remained the most frequently performed Greek tragedy through the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Helene P. Foley: ''Reimagining Greek Tragedy on the American Stage''. University of California Press, 2012, p. 190&lt;/ref&gt;

===Art===
[[File:Klaus Mann.jpg|thumb|Exiled [[Klaus Mann]] as Staff Sergeant of the 5th US Army, Italy 1944]]
[[File:Anna Seghers Das siebte Kreuz 1942.jpg|thumb|Cover of [[Anna Seghers]]’ ''[[The Seventh Cross|Das siebte Kreuz]]'']]

After [[Medea]] was abandoned by [[Jason]] and had become a murderer out of revenge, she fled to Athens and married king [[Aigeus]] there, and became the stepmother of the hero [[Theseus]]. Due to a conflict with him, she must leave the [[Polis]] and go away into exile. [[John William Waterhouse]] (1849–1917), the English [[Pre-Raphaelite]] painter’s famous picture ''[[Jason and Medea]]'' shows a key moment before, when Medea tries to poison Theseus.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Elisabeth Prettejohn: ''Art of the Pre-Raphaelites''. Princeton University Press, London 2000, pp. 165-207. {{ISBN|0-691-07057-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Literature===

In ancient Rome, the Roman Senate had the power to declare the exile to individuals, families or even entire regions. One of the Roman victims was the poet [[Ovid]], who lived during the reign of [[Augustus]]. He was forced to leave Rome and move away to the city of Tomis on the Black Sea, now Constanta. There he wrote his famous work ''Tristia'' (Sorrows) about his bitter feelings in exile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tristia by Ovid – high drama and hoax|url= https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/aug/21/tristia-by-ovid-high-drama-and-hoax|website=theguardian.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Another, at least in a temporary exile, was [[Dante]].

The German language writer of novels, Franz Kafka, called "the Dante of the twentieth century"&lt;ref&gt;Quoted after Harold Bloom: ''Genius. A Mosaic of One Hundred Exemplary Creative Minds''. Warner Books. New York 2002, p. 206. {{ISBN|978-0-446-52717-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; by the poet [[W. H. Auden]], describes the exile of Karl Rossmann in the posthumously published novel ''Amerika''.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. an unabridged reading by [[Sven Regener]]: ''Amerika'', Roof Music, Bochum 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the period of National Socialism in the first few years after 1933, many Jews, as well as a significant number of German artists and intellectuals fled into exile; for instance, the authors [[Klaus Mann]]  and [[Anna Seghers]]. So Germany’s own exile literature emerged and received worldwide credit.&lt;ref&gt;See Martin Mauthner: ''German Writers in French Exile, 1933–1940'', Vallentine Mitchell, London 2007, {{ISBN|978-0-85303-540-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Klaus Mann finished his novel ''{{Interlanguage link multi|Der Vulkan|de}}'' (''The Volcano. A Novel Among Emigrants'') in 1939&lt;ref&gt;which he started in September 1936, when he came to New York. Cf. Jan Patocka in: ''Escape to Life. German Intellectuals in New York. A Compendium on Exile after 1933'', ed. by Eckart Goebel/Sigrid Weigel. De Gruyter, Berlin/Boston 2012, p 354. {{ISBN|978-3-11-025867-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; describing the German exile scene, "to bring the rich, scattered and murky experience of exile into epic form",&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Klaus Mann: Der Wendepunkt. Ein Lebensbericht''. (1949), Frankfurt am Main 2006, p. 514.&lt;/ref&gt; as he wrote in his literary balance sheet.  At the same place and in the same year, Anna Seghers published her famous novel ''Das siebte Kreuz'' (''[[The Seventh Cross]]'', published in the United States in 1942).

Important exile literatures in recent years include that of the Caribbean, many of whose artists emigrated to Europe or the United States for political or economic reasons. These writers include Nobel Prize winners [[V. S. Naipaul]] and [[Derek Walcott]] as well as the novelists [[Edwidge Danticat]] and [[Sam Selvon]].&lt;ref&gt; See Timo Müller, “[http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/14788810.2016.1220790?journalCode=rjas20 Forms of Exile: Experimental Self-Positioning in Postcolonial Caribbean Poetry],” ''Atlantic Studies'' 13.4 (2016): 457-71.&lt;/ref&gt;

On a [[differentiable manifold]], the '''exterior derivative''' extends the concept of the [[pushforward (differential)|differential]] of a function to [[differential form]]s of higher degree. The exterior derivative was first described in its current form by [[Élie Cartan]] in 1899; it allows for a natural, metric-independent generalization of [[Stokes' theorem]], [[Gauss's theorem]], and [[Green's theorem]] from vector calculus.

If a {{math|''k''}}-form is thought of as measuring the flux through an infinitesimal {{math|''k''}}-[[Parallelepiped#Parallelotope|parallelotope]], then its exterior derivative can be thought of as measuring the net flux through the boundary of a {{math|(''k'' + 1)}}-parallelotope.

== Definition ==
The exterior derivative of a [[differential form]] of degree {{math|''k''}} is a differential form of degree {{math|''k'' + 1.}}

If {{math|&amp;thinsp;''f''&amp;thinsp;}} is a [[Smoothness|smooth function]] (a {{math|0}}-form), then the exterior derivative of {{math|&amp;thinsp;''f''&amp;thinsp;}} is the [[Pushforward (differential)|differential]] of {{math|&amp;thinsp;''f''&amp;thinsp;}}. That is, {{math|''df''&amp;thinsp;}} is the unique [[1-form|{{math|1}}-form]] such that for every smooth [[vector field]] {{math|''X''}}, {{math|1=''df''&amp;thinsp;(''X'') = ''d''&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;thinsp;''f''&amp;thinsp;}}, where {{math|''d''&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;thinsp;''f''&amp;thinsp;}} is the [[directional derivative]] of {{math|&amp;thinsp;''f''&amp;thinsp;}} in the direction of {{math|''X''}}.

There are a variety of equivalent definitions of the exterior derivative of a general {{math|''k''}}-form.

===In terms of axioms===
The exterior derivative is defined to be the unique {{math|ℝ}}-linear mapping from {{math|''k''}}-forms to {{math|(''k'' + 1)}}-forms satisfying the following properties:

# {{math|''df''&amp;thinsp;}} is the [[Differential_of_a_function|differential]] of {{math|&amp;thinsp;''f''&amp;thinsp;}}, for {{math|0}}-forms  ([[Smoothness|smooth functions]]) {{math|&amp;thinsp;''f''&amp;thinsp;}}.
# {{math|1=''d''(''df''&amp;thinsp;) = 0}} for any {{math|0}}-form (smooth function) {{math|&amp;thinsp;''f''&amp;thinsp;}}.
# {{math|1=''d''(''α'' ∧ ''β'') = ''dα'' ∧ ''β'' + (−1){{sup|''p''}} (''α'' ∧ ''dβ'')}} where {{mvar|α}} is a {{math|''p''}}-form. That is to say, {{math|''d''}} is an [[derivation (algebra)|antiderivation]] of degree {{math|1}} on the [[exterior algebra]] of differential forms.

The second defining property holds in more generality: in fact, {{math|1=''d''(''dα'') = 0}} for any {{math|''k''}}-form {{mvar|α}}; more succinctly, {{math|1=''d''{{i sup|2}} = 0}}. The third defining property implies as a special case that if {{math|&amp;thinsp;''f''&amp;thinsp;}} is a function and {{mvar|α}} a {{math|''k''}}-form, then {{math|1=''d''(&amp;thinsp;''fα'') = ''d''(&amp;thinsp;''f'' ∧ ''α'') = ''df''&amp;thinsp; ∧ ''α'' + &amp;thinsp;''f''&amp;thinsp; ∧ ''dα''}} because functions are {{math|0}}-forms, and scalar multiplication and the exterior product are equivalent when one of the arguments is a scalar.

===In terms of local coordinates===
Alternatively, one can work entirely in a [[local coordinate system]] {{math|(''x''{{sup|1}}, ..., ''x''{{i sup|''n''}})}}. The coordinate differentials {{math|''dx''{{sup|1}}, ..., ''dx''{{i sup|''n''}}}} form a basis of the space of one-forms, each associated with a coordinate. Given a [[multi-index]] {{math|1=''I'' = (''i''{{sub|1}}, ..., ''i''{{sub|''k''}})}} with {{math|1 ≤ ''i''{{sub|''p''}} ≤ ''n''}} for {{math|1 ≤ ''p'' ≤ ''k''}} (and denoting {{math|''dx''{{i sup|''i''{{sub|1}}}} ∧ ... ∧ ''dx''{{i sup|''i''{{sub|''k''}}}}}} with an [[abuse of notation]] {{math|1=''dx''{{i sup|''I''}}}}), the exterior derivative of a (simple) {{math|''k''}}-form

:&lt;math&gt;\varphi = g\,dx^I = g\,dx^{i_1}\wedge dx^{i_2}\wedge\cdots\wedge dx^{i_k}&lt;/math&gt;

over {{math|ℝ{{sup|''n''}}}} is defined as

:&lt;math&gt;d{\varphi} =  \frac{\partial g}{\partial x^i} dx^i \wedge dx^I&lt;/math&gt;

(using [[Einstein notation]]).  The definition of the exterior derivative is extended [[linear]]ly to a general {{math|''k''}}-form

:&lt;math&gt;\omega = f_I dx^I,&lt;/math&gt;

where each of the components of the multi-index {{math|''I''}} run over all the values in {{math|{1, ..., ''n''}&lt;nowiki/&gt;}}. Note that whenever {{math|''i''}} equals one of the components of the multi-index {{math|''I''}} then {{math|1=''dx''{{i sup|''i''}} ∧ ''dx''{{i sup|''I''}} = 0}} (see [[Exterior product]]).

The definition of the exterior derivative in local coordinates follows from the preceding [[#In terms of axioms|definition in terms of axioms]]. Indeed, with the {{math|''k''}}-form {{math|''φ''}} as defined above,

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
d{\varphi} &amp;= d\left (g\,dx^{i_1} \wedge \cdots \wedge dx^{i_k} \right ) \\
                   &amp;= dg  \wedge \left (dx^{i_1} \wedge \cdots \wedge dx^{i_k} \right ) + g\,d\left (
                      dx^{i_1}\wedge \cdots \wedge dx^{i_k} \right ) \\
                   &amp;= dg \wedge dx^{i_1} \wedge \cdots \wedge dx^{i_k} + g \sum_{p=1}^k (-1)^{p-1} dx^{i_1}
                      \wedge \cdots \wedge dx^{i_{p-1}} \wedge d^2x^{i_p} \wedge dx^{i_{p+1}} \wedge \cdots \wedge d
                      x^{i_k} \\
                     &amp;= dg \wedge dx^{i_1} \wedge \cdots \wedge dx^{i_k} \\
                     &amp;= \frac{\partial g}{\partial x^i} dx^i \wedge dx^{i_1} \wedge \cdots \wedge dx^{i_k} \\
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Here, we have interpreted {{math|''g''}} as a {{math|0}}-form, and then applied the properties of the exterior derivative.

This result extends directly to the general {{math|''k''}}-form {{math|''ω''}} as

:&lt;math&gt;d{\omega} = \frac{\partial f_I}{\partial x^i} dx^i \wedge dx^I .&lt;/math&gt;

In particular, for a {{math|1}}-form {{math|''ω''}}, the components of {{math|''dω''}} in local coordinates are
:&lt;math&gt;(d\omega)_{ij} = \partial_i \omega_j - \partial_j \omega_i. &lt;/math&gt;

===In terms of invariant formula===
Alternatively, an explicit formula can be given for the exterior derivative of a {{math|''k''}}-form {{math|''ω''}}, when paired with {{math|''k'' + 1}} arbitrary smooth [[vector field]]s {{math|''V''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;,''V''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''V''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;}}:

:&lt;math&gt;d\omega(V_0,...,V_k) = \sum_i(-1)^{i} V_i \left( \omega \left (V_0, \ldots, \hat V_i, \ldots,V_k \right )\right) +\sum_{i&lt;j}(-1)^{i+j}\omega \left (\left [V_i, V_j \right ], V_0, \ldots, \hat V_i, \ldots, \hat V_j, \ldots, V_k \right )&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|[''V&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''V&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;'']}} denotes the [[Lie bracket of vector fields|Lie bracket]] and a hat denotes the omission of that element:

:&lt;math&gt;\omega \left (V_0, \ldots, \hat V_i, \ldots,V_k \right ) = \omega \left (V_0, \ldots, V_{i-1}, V_{i+1}, \ldots, V_k \right ).&lt;/math&gt;

In particular, for {{math|1}}-forms we have: {{math|1=''dω''(''X'', ''Y'') = ''X''(''ω''(''Y'')) − ''Y''(''ω''(''X'')) − ''ω''([''X'', ''Y''])}}, where {{math|''X''}} and {{math|''Y''}} are vector fields, {{math|''X''(''ω''(''Y''))}} is the scalar field defined by the vector field {{math|''X'' ∈ Γ(''TM'')}} applied as a differential operator ("directional derivative along ''X''") to the scalar field defined by applying {{math|''ω'' ∈ Γ{{sup|∗}}(''TM'')}} as a covector field to the vector field {{math|''Y'' ∈ Γ(''TM'')}} and likewise for {{math|''Y''(''ω''(''X''))}}.

'''Note:''' Some authors (e.g., Kobayashi–Nomizu and Helgason) use a formula that differs by a factor of {{math|{{sfrac|''k'' + 1}}}}:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}d\omega(V_0,...,V_k) &amp;= {1 \over k+1} \sum_i(-1)^{i} V_i \left( \omega \left (V_0, \ldots, \hat V_i, \ldots,V_k \right )\right) \\
&amp;+ {1 \over k+1}  \sum_{i&lt;j}(-1)^{i+j}\omega \left (\left [V_i, V_j \right ], V_0, \ldots, \hat V_i, \ldots, \hat V_j, \ldots, V_k \right ).\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

== Examples ==
'''Example 1.''' Consider {{math|1=''σ'' = ''u''&amp;thinsp;''dx''{{i sup|1}} ∧ ''dx''{{i sup|2}}}} over a {{math|1}}-form basis {{math|''dx''{{i sup|1}}, ..., ''dx''{{i sup|''n''}}}}. The exterior derivative is:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  d\sigma &amp;= du \wedge dx^1 \wedge dx^2 \\
                    &amp;= \left(\sum_{i=1}^n \frac{\partial u}{\partial x^i} dx^i\right) \wedge dx^1 \wedge dx^2 \\
                    &amp;= \sum_{i=3}^n \left( \frac{\partial u}{\partial x^i} dx^i \wedge dx^1 \wedge dx^2 \right )
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

The last formula follows easily from the properties of the [[exterior product]]. Namely, {{math|1=''dx''{{i sup|''i''}} ∧ ''dx''{{i sup|''i''}} = 0}}.

'''Example 2.''' Let {{math|1=''σ'' = ''u''&amp;thinsp;''dx'' + ''v''&amp;thinsp;''dy''}} be a {{math|1}}-form defined over {{math|ℝ{{sup|2}}}}. By applying the above formula to each term (consider {{math|1=''x''{{i sup|1}} = ''x''}} and {{math|1=''x''{{i sup|2}} = ''y''}}) we have the following sum,

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
d\sigma 
    &amp;= \left( \sum_{i=1}^2 \frac{\partial u}{\partial x^i} dx^i \wedge dx \right) + \left( \sum_{i=1}^2 \frac{\partial v}{\partial x^i} dx^i \wedge dy \right) \\
    &amp;= \left(\frac{\partial{u}}{\partial{x}} dx \wedge dx + \frac{\partial{u}}{\partial{y}} dy \wedge dx\right) + \left(\frac{\partial{v}}{\partial{x}} dx \wedge dy + \frac{\partial{v}}{\partial{y}} dy \wedge dy\right) \\
    &amp;= 0 - \frac{\partial{u}}{\partial{y}} dx \wedge dy + \frac{\partial{v}}{\partial{x}} dx \wedge dy + 0 \\
    &amp;= \left(\frac{\partial{v}}{\partial{x}} - \frac{\partial{u}}{\partial{y}}\right) dx \wedge dy
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

== Stokes' theorem on manifolds ==
{{main|Stokes' theorem}}

If {{math|''M''}} is a compact smooth orientable {{math|''n''}}-dimensional manifold with boundary, and {{math|''ω''}} is an {{math|(''n'' − 1)}}-form on {{math|''M''}}, then the generalized form of [[Stokes' theorem]] states that:

:&lt;math&gt;\int_M d\omega = \int_{\partial{M}} \omega&lt;/math&gt;

Intuitively, if one thinks of {{math|''M''}} as being divided into infinitesimal regions, and one adds the flux through the boundaries of all the regions, the interior boundaries all cancel out, leaving the total flux through the boundary of {{math|''M''}}.

== Further properties ==

===Closed and exact forms===
{{main article|Closed and exact forms}}
A {{math|''k''}}-form {{math|''ω''}} is called ''closed'' if {{math|1=''dω'' = 0}}; closed forms are the [[Kernel (algebra)|kernel]] of {{math|''d''}}. {{math|''ω''}} is called ''exact'' if {{math|1=''ω'' = ''dα''}} for some {{math|(''k'' − 1)}}-form {{math|''α''}}; exact forms are the [[Image (mathematics)|image]] of {{math|''d''}}. Because {{math|1=''d''{{i sup|2}} = 0}}, every exact form is closed. The [[Poincaré lemma]] states that in a contractible region, the converse is true.

===de Rham cohomology===
Because the exterior derivative {{math|''d''}} has the property that {{math|1=''d''{{i sup|2}} = 0}}, it can be used as the [[Cochain complex|differential]] (coboundary) to define [[de Rham cohomology]] on a manifold. The {{math|''k''}}-th de Rham cohomology (group) is the vector space of closed {{math|''k''}}-forms modulo the exact {{math|''k''}}-forms; as noted in the previous section, the Poincaré lemma states that these vector spaces are trivial for a contractible region, for {{math|''k'' &gt; 0}}. For [[smooth manifold]]s, integration of forms gives a natural homomorphism from the de Rham cohomology to the singular cohomology over {{math|ℝ}}. The theorem of de Rham shows that this map is actually an isomorphism, a far-reaching generalization of the Poincaré lemma. As suggested by the generalized Stokes' theorem, the exterior derivative is the "dual" of the [[Chain complex#Formal definition|boundary map]] on singular simplices.

===Naturality===
The exterior derivative is natural in the technical sense: if {{math|&amp;thinsp;''f'' : ''M'' → ''N''}} is a smooth map and {{math|Ω{{sup|''k''}}}} is the contravariant smooth [[functor]] that assigns to each manifold the space of {{math|''k''}}-forms on the manifold, then the following diagram commutes

:[[Image:Exteriorderivnatural.png|none]]

so {{math|1=''d''(&amp;thinsp;''f''{{i sup|∗}}''ω'') = &amp;thinsp;''f''{{i sup|∗}}''dω''}}, where {{math|&amp;thinsp;''f''{{i sup|∗}}}} denotes the [[pullback (differential geometry)|pullback]] of {{math|&amp;thinsp;''f''&amp;thinsp;}}. This follows from that {{math|&amp;thinsp;''f''{{i sup|∗}}''ω''(·)}}, by definition, is {{math|''ω''(&amp;thinsp;''f''&lt;sub&gt;∗&lt;/sub&gt;(·))}}, {{math|&amp;thinsp;''f''&lt;sub&gt;∗&lt;/sub&gt;}} being the [[Pushforward (differential)|pushforward]] of {{math|&amp;thinsp;''f''&amp;thinsp;}}. Thus {{math|''d''}} is a [[natural transformation]] from {{math|Ω{{sup|''k''}}}} to {{math|Ω{{sup|''k''+1}}}}.

== Exterior derivative in vector calculus ==
Most [[vector calculus]] operators are special cases of, or have close relationships to, the notion of exterior differentiation.

===Gradient===
A [[smooth function]] {{math|&amp;thinsp;''f'' : ''M'' → ℝ}} on a real differentiable manifold {{math|''M''}} is a {{math|0}}-form. The exterior derivative of this {{math|0}}-form is the {{math|1}}-form {{math|''df''}}.

When an inner product {{math|{{langle}}·,·{{rangle}}}} is defined, the [[gradient]] {{math|∇''f''&amp;thinsp;}} of a function {{math|&amp;thinsp;''f''&amp;thinsp;}} is defined as the unique vector in {{math|''V''}} such that its inner product with any element of {{math|''V''}} is the directional derivative of {{math|&amp;thinsp;''f''&amp;thinsp;}} along the vector, that is such that

:&lt;math&gt;\langle \nabla f, \cdot \rangle = df = \sum_{i=1}^n \frac{\partial f}{\partial x^i}\, dx^i .&lt;/math&gt;

That is,
:&lt;math&gt;\nabla f = (df)^\sharp = \sum_{i=1}^n \frac{\partial f}{\partial x^i}\, (dx^i)^\sharp ,&lt;/math&gt;
where {{math|{{music|sharp}}}} denotes the [[musical isomorphism]] {{math|{{music|sharp}} : ''V''{{sup|∗}} → ''V''}} mentioned earlier that is induced by the inner product.

The {{math|1}}-form {{math|''df''&amp;thinsp;}} is a section of the [[cotangent bundle]], that gives a local linear approximation to {{math|&amp;thinsp;''f''&amp;thinsp;}} in the cotangent space at each point.

===Divergence===
A vector field {{math|1=''V'' = (''v''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''v''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ... ''v&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'')}} on {{math|ℝ{{sup|''n''}}}} has a corresponding {{math|(''n'' − 1)}}-form

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\omega_V &amp;= v_1 \left (dx^2 \wedge \cdots \wedge dx^n \right) - v_2 \left (dx^1 \wedge dx^3  \wedge \cdots \wedge dx^n \right ) + \cdots + (-1)^{n-1}v_n \left (dx^1 \wedge \cdots \wedge dx^{n-1} \right) \\
&amp;=\sum_{p=1}^n (-1)^{(p-1)}v_p \left (dx^1 \wedge \cdots \wedge dx^{p-1} \wedge \widehat{dx^{p}} \wedge dx^{p+1} \wedge \cdots \wedge dx^n \right )
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\widehat{dx^{p}}&lt;/math&gt; denotes the omission of that element.

(For instance, when {{math|1=''n'' = 3}}, i.e. in three-dimensional space, the {{math|2}}-form {{math|''ω&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;''}} is locally the [[scalar triple product]] with {{math|''V''}}.)  The integral of {{math|''ω&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;''}} over a hypersurface is the [[flux]] of {{math|''V''}} over that hypersurface.

The exterior derivative of this {{math|(''n'' − 1)}}-form is the {{math|''n''}}-form

:&lt;math&gt;d\omega _V = \operatorname{div} V \left (dx^1 \wedge dx^2 \wedge \cdots \wedge dx^n \right ).&lt;/math&gt;

===Curl===
A vector field {{math|''V''}} on {{math|ℝ{{sup|''n''}}}} also has a corresponding {{math|1}}-form

:&lt;math&gt;\eta_V = v_1  dx^1 + v_2 dx^2 + \cdots + v_n dx^n.&lt;/math&gt;,

Locally, {{math|''η&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;''}} is the dot product with {{math|''V''}}. The integral of {{math|''η&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;''}} along a path is the [[Mechanical work|work]] done against {{math|−''V''}} along that path.

When {{math|1=''n'' = 3}}, in three-dimensional space, the exterior derivative of the {{math|1}}-form {{math|''η&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;''}} is the {{math|2}}-form

:&lt;math&gt;d\eta_V = \omega_{\operatorname{curl} V}.&lt;/math&gt;

===Invariant formulations of operators in vector calculus===
The standard [[vector calculus]] operators can be generalized for any [[pseudo-Riemannian manifold]], and written in coordinate-free notation as follows:

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{array}{rcccl}
      \operatorname{grad} f &amp;\equiv&amp; \nabla f        &amp;=&amp; \left( d f \right)^\sharp \\
      \operatorname{div} F  &amp;\equiv&amp; \nabla \cdot F  &amp;=&amp; {\star d {\star} ( F^\flat )} \\
      \operatorname{curl} F &amp;\equiv&amp; \nabla \times F &amp;=&amp; \left( {\star} d ( F^\flat ) \right)^\sharp \\
      \Delta f              &amp;\equiv&amp; \nabla^2 f      &amp;=&amp; {\star} d {\star} d f \\
                            &amp;      &amp; \nabla^2 F      &amp;=&amp; \left(d{\star}d{\star}(F^{\flat}) - {\star}d{\star}d(F^{\flat})\right)^{\sharp} , \\
\end{array}
&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|⋆}} is the [[Hodge dual|Hodge star operator]], {{music|flat}} and {{music|sharp}} are the [[musical isomorphism]]s, {{mvar|&amp;thinsp;f&amp;thinsp;}} is a [[scalar field]] and {{mvar|F}} is a [[vector field]].

Note that the expression for &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{curl}&lt;/math&gt; makes sense only in three dimensions, since it requires &lt;math&gt;\sharp&lt;/math&gt; to act on &lt;math&gt;{\star} d( F^\flat )&lt;/math&gt;, which is a form of degree &lt;math&gt;n-2&lt;/math&gt;.

'''''Fate '''''is a [[generic role-playing game system]] based on the ''[[Fudge_(role-playing_game_system)|Fudge]]'' gaming system. It has no fixed setting, traits, or genre and is customizable. It is designed to offer minimal obstruction to role-playing by assuming players want to make fewer dice rolls.

''Fate'' was written by [[Fred Hicks]] and [[Rob Donoghue]]; the 1st edition was published in early 2003,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.faterpg.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/fate1e.pdf |format=PDF |title=Fate: About Fudge |website=Faterpg.com |accessdate=2015-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the latest version (4th edition) was published successfully through crowd sourcing [[Kickstarter]] in 2013. ''Fate'' gained adherents both for its high level of support, which is unusual for a free game, and for the numerous innovative gaming mechanics.{{Citation needed|reason=Unsubstantiated claim|date=July 2014}}

==System==
[[Image:FUDGE 4dF probability.svg|thumb|230px|right|Probability of results in the Fate system]]
Fate is derived from the ''[[Fudge_(role-playing_game_system)|Fudge]]'' system, primarily that earlier design's verbal scale and [[Fudge dice]], but most versions of Fate eschew the use of mandatory traits such as Strength and Intelligence. Instead, it uses a long list of skills and assumes that every character is "mediocre" in all skills except those that the character is explicitly defined as being good at. Skills may perform one or more of the four actions: attacking, defending, overcoming obstacles (a catch-all for solving problems) or creating an advantage (see below). Exceptional abilities are defined through the use of ''Stunts'' and ''Aspects''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
| title = RPGnet : Review of FATE: Fantastic Adventures in Tabletop Entertainment. Fudge Edition
| accessdate = 2007-10-25
| url = http://www.rpg.net/reviews/archive/10/10206.phtml
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An aspect is a [[Freeform role-playing game|free form]] descriptor of something notable about either the character or the scene. A relevant aspect can be invoked to grant a bonus to a die roll (either adding +2, or allowed a re-roll of the dice); this usually costs the player or GM a fate point. Aspects may also be compelled to influence the setting by offering the person with the aspect a fate point (which they can refuse by spending one of their own) to put them at a disadvantage relevant to the aspect. An example given in the rule book refers to the GM invoking a [[player character]]'s ''Rivals in the Collegia Arcana'' aspect to have said rivals attack them in the bath so they don't have access to their equipment. Situational aspects describe the scene, and may be created and used by the GM, or by players using the create advantage action with a relevant skill.

Stunts are exceptional abilities that grant the character a specific mechanical benefit; these may be drawn from a pre-defined list of stunts included in the rules, or created following guidelines provided by the authors.&lt;ref name="SotC_Stunts"&gt;{{cite book | quote=What follows is not a comprehensive list of stunts. GMs (and players under GM supervision) are encouraged to create their own to fit their game. |title=Spirit of the Century |last1=Donoghue |first1=Rob | last2=Hicks | first2=Fred | last3=Balsera | first3=Leonard |year=2006 |publisher=Evil Hat Productions |isbn=978-0-9771534-0-4 |page=115 }}&lt;!--|accessdate=7 November 2011--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Aspects, on the other hand, are always defined by the player. For example, a player may choose to give their character an aspect of "Brawny" (or "Muscle Man" or "Wiry Strength"); during play, the player may invoke those aspects to gain a temporary bonus in a relevant situation. Aspects may also relate to a character's possessions, e.g. the character [[Indiana Jones]] for example, might have the Aspect "Whip and Fedora".

==FATE versus Fate (naming conventions)==
When the system was originally published FATE was considered an acronym for “Fudge Adventures in Tabletop Entertainment” and then “Fantastic Adventures in Tabletop Entertainment”. Most recently ''FATE'' has been simplified to just be ''Fate'' and is no longer an acronym.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.faterpg.com/2013/fate-not-fate/ |title=Fate not FATE » Fate |website=Faterpg.com |date= |accessdate=2015-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Fate'' OGL resources==
While there has been concern that ''[[Fudge (role-playing game system)|Fudge]]'' would restrict its "open" license and thus force ''Fate'' to change to a different underlying mechanic, such fears have subsided once ''Fudge'' itself was released under the [[Open Gaming License]]. ''Fate'' has an associated [[Yahoo!]] Group to discuss the gaming system and share settings and conversions of other [[role-playing game]]s.

==''Fate'' 3rd Edition ==
The 3rd edition of ''Fate'' was no longer a generic RPG like the first two versions, but set in the [[Pulp magazine|pulp]] genre. It is called [[Spirit of the Century]] and was nominated in 2007 for an [[ENnie]] award for ''Best Rules''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Several other role-playing games are built on the game mechanics of ''Fate 3.0''.

==Fate Core (4th edition) and Fate Accelerated Edition (FAE)==
A new (4th) edition called ''Fate Core'' (again a generic version) was published in 2013, funded by a successful crowdfunding campaign, and released under two [[free content]] licenses: [[CC BY|CC BY 3.0]] and the [[Open gaming license]].

As a result of the crowd funding effort, Evil Hat Productions released ''Fate Accelerated'', a streamlined version of the rules based on the same core mechanic intended to get players into the game faster. One notable difference is that skills are replaced with six "approaches" to solving problems - Careful, Clever, Flashy, Forceful, Quick, and Sneaky. The approaches can each use all four skill actions.

== Kickstarter ==
To release the new version of Fate, Evil Hat Productions ran a Kickstarter campaign that initially asked for $3,000. At the end of the campaign they raised $433,365 and expanded the product line significantly, adding two world books and a system toolkit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/evilhat/fate-core |title=Fate Core by Fred Hicks / Evil Hat Productions — Kickstarter |website=Kickstarter.com |date= |accessdate=2015-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="33384">'''Free speech fights''' are struggles over free speech, and especially those struggles which involved the [[Industrial Workers of the World]] and their attempts to gain awareness for labor issues by organizing workers and urging them to use their collective voice. During the World War I period in the United States, the IWW members (referred to as Wobblies), engaged in free speech fights over labor issues which were closely connected to the developing industrial world as well as the [[Socialist Party]]. The Wobblies, along with other radical groups, were often met with opposition (violent and otherwise) from local governments and especially business leaders, in their free speech fights.

The IWW organized transient workers (especially in cities in the American West) who worked in highly seasonal jobs—they met on the streets, discussed contemporary issues, and listened to speakers; at the time, it was a very popular method of organization. The events often ended with the police arresting them for participating in street meetings. The most notorious of all of the free speech fights was the [[San Diego free speech fight]], which won a significant amount of public awareness for the IWW as it involved tremendous violence against the labor groups organized by the IWW.&lt;ref&gt;Brisseden, p.283, and Whitten, p.6.&lt;/ref&gt; which brought the IWW to the greater notice of the American public and was notable for the intensity of violence by anti-labor vigilantes directed at the IWW; this violence included the kidnapping and [[tarring and feathering]] of [[Ben Reitman]], who was a physician, and was [[Emma Goldman]]'s lover.

More generally, a '''free speech fight''' is any incident in which a group is involved in a conflict over its speech. For instance, the [[Free Speech Movement]], which began with a conflict on the [[University of California, Berkeley|Berkeley Campus]] in [[California]] in the 1960s, was a "free speech fight".

=="Free speech fights" and the IWW==
{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2014}}
The IWW engaged in free speech fights during the period from approximately 1907 to 1916. The ''Wobblies'', as the IWW members were called, relied upon [[Freedom of speech|free speech]], which in the United States is guaranteed by the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]], to enable them to communicate the concept of [[One Big Union (concept)|One Big Union]] to other workers. In communities where the authorities saw their interests in avoiding the development of unions, the practice of [[soapbox]]ing was frequently restricted by ordinance or by police harassment. The IWW [[Industrial Workers of the World philosophy and tactics|employed a variety of creative tactics]], including the tactic of flooding the area of a free speech fight with ''footloose rebels'' who would challenge the authorities by flouting the ordinance, intentionally getting arrested in great numbers. With the jails full and a seemingly endless stream of union activists arriving by boxcar and highway, the local communities frequently rescinded their prohibitions on free speech, or came to some other accommodation.

[[The Free Speech League]], a progressive group which functioned at the same time as (and occasionally together with) the IWW, worked in conjunction with the IWW prior to World War I in many of their free speech fights, which generated a good deal of controversy. The free speech fights of the IWW were highly publicized, as they were designed to garner attention: they frequently started when local communities interjected to attempt to prevent the IWW from occupying street corners from which they would use provocative language to detail their radical beliefs.  The free speech fights began occurring in 1906 and drew to a close by 1917—over that period of time, at least 26 communities played host to the IWW's free speech fights, and the years of 1909 to 1913 were particularly active, with at least 21 free speech fights happening.

The IWW members who engaged in the free speech fights typically cited the [[First Amendment]] and the rights guaranteed therein as proof positive of the validity of their cause, thereby highlighting the legal importance of the issues they fought for. That being the case, their struggles did not go unanswered or ignored: local, state, and even the federal government were prompted to respond, while, perhaps more importantly, the American public, due to the national publicity garnered by the free speech fights, were invariably tasked with confronting free speech issues. Practically all realms of American life were impacted by the free speech fights, as members of the press, church officials, school teachers, politicians, anyone involved in the business and labor world, and members of any organization (especially those of the Socialist Party) had a stake in the fights and thus attempted to comment on the issues in contention.

===An overview of the free speech fights===
From its inception, the IWW was deeply committed to free speech issues, and especially those affiliated with labor groups. The IWW formed in 1905 in response to dissatisfaction with the trade unions promoted by the [[American Federation of Labor]] (the AFL).  Whereas the AFL promoted the ideals of capitalism by fighting for the rights of workers within the ideological framework of the free market system, the IWW functioned on anarchistic principles. Rather than urging workers to join unions based on craft and skill that were determined to form binding trade agreements with employers, the IWW advocated for the development of broad unions for low-skill workers that would be driven by the workers themselves (and their collective actions) rather than by top-down politics and binding capitalist decisions.

The primary vehicles of change for the free speech fights of the IWW were spontaneous workplace strikes as well as on-site labor slowdowns in addition to picketing, parades, and demonstrations. Importantly, the IWW engaged in street corner public displays and speaking to raise the public awareness regarding free speech fights. The desire for direct action by laborers was attributed to having grown disaffected with the beliefs of the AFL. They stressed their truly American origins and likened their actions to those of earlier American revolutionaries and activists.

The free speech fights of the IWW were often quite similar in nature: Wobblies (many of whom travelled across the country to spread their message) would visit a city's downtown and attempt to speak on soapboxes on street corners. Their message and their tactics were particularly provocative, and they were frequently arrested—though, if they were not arrested on one street corner, they would simply pack up and head to another one.  
Among the offences which they were arrested for were blocking traffic, vagrancy, unlawful assembly, or violating local ordinances such as ones against speaking on the streets.

Though the IWW was successful in many of their free speech fights, they did not always achieve their desired goals. In San Diego, for instance, they were unable to cause the repeal of a restrictive street ordinance while, in Paterson, they failed to gain protection for street picketing and meetings.

===The IWW ideology of free speech===
The ideology of the Wobblies who fought for free speech rights across America was deeply indebted to their core beliefs regarding the provenance of the First Amendment rights of the Constitution. In their estimation, they were fighting with the Constitution on their side while those who opposed them, such as city officials, were disregarding the fundamental laws of the country. The Wobblies frequently used phrases such as "Have you ever read the Constitution?" and "What is this, Czarist Russia, or Free America?"

The Wobblies held that the free speech rights granted by the First Amendment had been abridged over time, and they felt that it nowhere more evident than it was in the case of the laborers for whom they worked tirelessly—capitalism had conspired with the judicial system in the United States to deny agency and the Constitutionally-granted freedom of speech to American laborers. Not all Wobblies subscribed to such idealistic ideology, though, since some argued the more pessimistic belief that the Constitution had been written by the elites and that free speech was merely an illusion that worked to uphold the power of those same elites.
By adopting aggressive tactics which flaunted local ordinances against free speech, the Wobblies courted arrest, which they used as a demonstration of how far the abridgement of free speech had come. The official attempts to silence the IWW in the free speech fights, they argued, were totally opposed to the spirit of the First Amendment.

According to the Wobblies, the fact that they even had to fight for free speech rights was evidence of the corrupting effect of capitalism in America and of its legal system. They argued that the Constitution was not being applied to American laborers, just as it had not been applied to slaves in the century prior. Rather than take their fights to the courts, which they felt were substantially corrupted by capitalist influence, they took their fight to the streets and urged other Americans to do the same.

The publications of the IWW urged people to "Educate, Agitate, Organize!!!" which led their opponents to see the fights for free speech as precursors to more insidious desires such as those for unionization and, especially, for the abolition of capitalism.

===Popular reactions===
The free speech fights of the IWW were an inherently populist in nature. They were met with a variety of different public response and reactions: some supported their efforts and sought to collaborate with them while others engaged in vigilante violence against them (as was especially the case in San Diego). The free speech fights gained mass support from political groups such as labor unions, Socialists, and also the Free Speech League. Notably, few of the groups stood fast with the IWW when it came to their calls for revolution or for the overthrowing of capitalism more generally, and instead focused on the importance of the free speech rights for their own inherent worth to Americans. The AFL, though, opposed the IWW's efforts in the free speech realm from the get go. Other groups and members of the public, too, began to oppose the free speech fights over time because of the aggressive tactics and language among other things.

The Socialists were the most closely connected allies of the IWW in the free speech fights, as they had suffered through many years of free speech repression already and thus helped to fundraise for the cause and occasional even took part in the fights.

Labor unions also offered significant support to the free speech fight cause since they had a stake in the fights. Important support, still, came from the American public at large.

===Official reactions and regulation of street speaking===
The most notable proponent of the free speech fights in the official arena was New York City Police Commissioner Arthur Woods, who argued that all American groups should be granted the right of free speech and assembly. Rather than repress their constitutional rights, Woods felt that it was the duty of the police to protect the demonstrators. His personal philosophy dictated that free speech could be regulated only in ways that protected it through the creation of channels of expression which would not impede the rights of others.

The reasonable regulation of street speaking was an important issue that arose because of the free speech fights of the IWW. Their soapboxing on downtown street corners proved especially divisive. Whereas IWW supporters held that freedom of expression was especially important in the areas where that expression could actually reach the people (such as laborers) who would benefit the most from their message, opponents argued that their right to free speech did not belong in such public places where their incendiary tactics could be harmful to the public. Public streets were the best means of reaching the workers to whom their free speech fights were addressed, and the Wobblies did not always possess the necessary funds to rent out public assembly halls, for instance, from which they could exercise their right to free speech. 
The IWW conceded, nonetheless, that reasonable restrictions should be placed on public speaking.

The struggle over free speech on downtown street corners was regarded as absurd by many people, since there were myriad other areas in the public sphere that allowed outdoor speaking to take place—downtown street corners, though, were outlawed. The fight over the street corners, therefore, became a symbol of the divisive ideology of the IWW—their opponents scornfully argued that the street corners were important to the Wobblies only because they could not reach an audience elsewhere since nobody would willingly attend any of their speeches.

Many of the opponents of free speech fights, thus, were in favor of the establishment of centrally located areas that permitted oration but did not interfere with the city. Others, though, were totally opposed to the right to speak in public.

The IWW occasionally saw its fight over the regulation of street speaking extend to the judicial realm. More often than not, judges upheld the street ordinances that prevented public speaking. Notably, a judge in San Diego upheld the city's ordinance, and used the language of a similar decision in Los Angeles to explain that "This ordinance does not attempt to suppress freedom of speech, or seek to interfere with the citizen in the right to express his views upon any subject, political, religious, or otherwise, as is suggested by the petitioner. It simply specifies a certain district within the city wherein no one may do the things prohibited."

===Analysis of free speech themes===
One of the key themes of the free speech fights came from the regulation of speaking on the streets and involved discussions over the importance of access to public property and how reasonable limitations could be applied to it. People who debated the free speech fights frequently focused on the distinction between legal speech and illegal action while also detailing the various types of unprotected speech. They also debated what types of criticisms of the government should be protected by free speech.

One of the primary issues with the debates surrounding the free speech fights was that commentators understood that certain types of speech should be regarded as illegal and were not covered as free speech—sedition, libel, inciting speech, and obscenity fell into this category of speech, yet what some regarded as obscenity or libel, others regarded simply as government criticism that should be protected by the Constitution.

==Major IWW's free speech fights==

===Spokane free speech fight===

In ''A History of American Labor'', Joseph G. Rayback has written,

&lt;blockquote&gt;[The Industrial Workers of the World] made its first impression upon the nation through its involvement in the "free speech" fight begun in [[Spokane, Washington]], employment center for the casual labor elements of the Pacific Northwest. The fight developed late in 1908 when the I.W.W. launched an extensive speaking campaign with the slogan "Don't Buy Jobs" in the streets around the Spokane employment agencies which had become skilled in the art of swindling men who applied for jobs.&lt;ref name="Rayback-244"&gt;Rayback, p. 244.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The "job sharks" were so closely tied to the crew boss on many job sites that there would be "one gang coming, one gang working and one gang going." The faster the turnover, the greater the fees that could be generated. From time to time the men would ignore the IWW and seek revenge after an employment shark took someone's last dollar for a job that didn't exist. The ''Spokesman-Review'' of January 18, 1909 reported,&lt;ref name="ThompsonMurfin-47"&gt;Thompson and Murfin, p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Hurling rocks and chunks of ice through the windows of the Red Cross Employment Agency, 224 Stevens St., several members of a noisy mob of between 2,000 and 3,000 idle men were about to attempt to wreck the place about 6 o'clock last evening, when [[James H. Walsh]], organizer of the IWW, mounted a chair and pacified the multitude. In the opinion of the police had it not been for the intervention of Walsh, a riot would surely have followed, as the rabble was worked up to such a pitch that its members would have readily attempted violence. Walsh discouraged violence and summoned all members of the IWW to their hall at the rear of 312 Front Ave. The police dispersed the rest... At the hall Walsh warned the crowd against an outbreak. "There were a lot of hired [[Pinkerton National Detective Agency|Pinkertons]] in that crowd," he said. "All they wanted you fellows to do was to start something and then they would have an excuse for shooting you down or smashing your heads in... You can gain nothing by resorting to mob rule."&lt;ref name="ThompsonMurfin-47-48"&gt;Thompson and Murfin, pp. 47-48.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

For the rest of the summer, IWW street meetings brought more and more [[Wobbly lingo#Stiff|working stiffs]] into the IWW.&lt;ref name="ThompsonMurfin-48"&gt;Thompson and Murfin, p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The agencies promptly countered by pressuring the city council to pass an ordinance forbidding street speaking. The I.W.W. obeyed the regulation for nearly a year, until Spokane religious groups, which habitually used the streets, secured a new regulation exempting them from the street-speaking ordinance. Angered by the discrimination on behalf of "the Christers," the Spokane I.W.W. renewed its campaign.&lt;ref name="Rayback-244" /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The newspaper of the IWW, the ''[[Industrial Worker]]'', published the following on October 28: "Wanted&amp;mdash;Men to Fill the Jails of Spokane." Then the IWW sent out a notice to all locations, "Nov. 2, FREE SPEECH DAY&amp;mdash;IWW locals will be notified by wire how many men to send if any... Meetings will be orderly and no irregularities of any kind will be tolerated."&lt;ref name="ThompsonMurfin-48" /&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;In one day 150 men were arrested and crowded into jails that could hardly accommodate them. Reinforcements promptly arrived from the surrounding territory.&lt;ref name="Rayback-244" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Spokane City Council arranged for rock-pile work for the prisoners.&lt;ref name="ThompsonMurfin-48" /&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;At the end of twenty days four hundred men had been jailed.&lt;ref name="Rayback-244" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Overflowing prisoners were lodged in the Franklin School [then located along Front Street (now Trent)], and the War Department made Fort Wright available for more. Eight editors in succession got out a copy of the ''Industrial Worker'', and then took their turn soapboxing, and went to jail. The IWW's "rebel girl," [[Elizabeth Gurley Flynn]], who was fresh out of high school, delayed her arrest by chaining herself to a lamppost. She later charged that the police were using the women's section of the jail as a brothel, with police soliciting customers. When that story was printed in the ''Industrial Worker'' on December 10, the police attempted to destroy all copies. Public sympathy began to favor the strikers. When the prison guards would march the overflowing prisoners through the streets to bathing facilities, crowds would shower the men with apples, oranges, and Cigarettes.&lt;ref name="ThompsonMurfin-49"&gt;Thompson and Murfin, p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The effort brought results: the [[Western Federation of Miners|W.F.M.]] declared a boycott of all goods coming from Spokane, and taxpayers began to protest against the cost of feeding, housing, and policing the prisoners. When [[Vincent Saint John|Vincent St. John]] publicly appealed to all Wobblies to come to Spokane to renew the struggle, city officials capitulated.&lt;ref name="Rayback-244" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The victory for the free speech fight came on March 4. The licenses of 19 of the employment agencies were revoked.&lt;ref name="ThompsonMurfin-49" /&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The I.W.W. was granted freedom of assembly, freedom of the press, and the right to distribute its literature.&lt;ref name="Rayback-244" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In ''Labor's Untold Story'', Boyer and Morais observed,

&lt;blockquote&gt;The courts became so clogged they could handle little else but free speech cases. The fight for free speech became largely a question of endurance between the lungs and heads of the Wobblies and the stamina of the police. In [[Missoula, Montana|Missoula]] and Spokane as in most of the other towns where free speech fights were waged, any citizen could address any assemblage on any street on any subject at any time by the end of 1912.&lt;ref name="BoyerMorais-174"&gt;Boyer and Morais, p.174.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Missoula free speech fight===

[[File:Elizabeth Gurley Flynn point.jpg|thumb|200px|left|[[Elizabeth Gurley Flynn]], firebrand soapboxer of the [[Industrial Workers of the World]]]]

The IWW members won a free speech fight in Missoula when, on October 8, 1909, the city council decided to let the union members speak anywhere in the community, so long as they did not impede traffic.&lt;ref&gt;Article, "Missoula witness to history of Industrial Workers of the World", ''Missoulian'', http://www.missoulian.com/news/local/article_a80ba83e-9b67-11de-942e-001cc4c002e0.html Sunday, September 6, 2009, retrieved Sunday, September 6, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Elizabeth Gurley Flynn]] was "a striking auburn-haired 19-year-old" when she arrived in Missoula with her husband, Jack Jones in September 1909. At Higgins Avenue and West Front Street, the Wobblies set up a soapbox. On September 22, [[Frank Little (unionist)|Frank Little]] arrived to assist. Little and Jones were arrested on September 29. A young logger and a civil engineer then spoke, and were likewise arrested. Flynn put out the word, declaring, "we need volunteers to go to jail." Wobblies poured in from the surrounding territory, flooding the jail. They sang IWW songs, and shouted Wobbly slogans.&lt;ref name="missoulian.com"&gt;Article, "Missoula witness to history of Industrial Workers of the World", ''Missoulian'', http://www.missoulian.com/news/local/article_a80ba83e-9b67-11de-942e-001cc4c002e0.html Sunday, September 6, 2009, retrieved Friday, April 29, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Flynn, who also was arrested, the jail was "a filthy, dirty hole under the firehouse stable, where all the filthy excrement of the place pours down upon the prisoners." Yet enough Wobblies submitted themselves to arrest—frequently just before dinner time—that the city was feeling the impact of the Wobbly tactic.&lt;ref name="missoulian.com"/&gt; After a night in jail, Wobblies were often offered their freedom before breakfast, but many refused to be released, instead demanding a jury trial.&lt;ref name="missoulian.com"/&gt;

The Western Montana Apple Show was set to open, and Missoula officials decided to "wave a white flag." The IWW had won the Missoula free speech fight, and all charges were dropped.&lt;ref name="missoulian.com"/&gt;

On February 7, 2011, the [[National Park Service]] officially recognized Free Speech Corner at Higgens Avenue and West Front Street, adding it to the [[National Register of Historic Places]] to commemorate the Missoula free speech fight.&lt;ref&gt;Kim Briggeman, ''Missoulian'', "Missoula downtown historic district expands" http://missoulian.com/news/local/article_48d77b24-7084-11e0-a541-001cc4c002e0.html published April 27, 2011, retrieved April 29, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

===San Diego free speech fight===

The [[San Diego free speech fight|free speech fight in San Diego]] from 1912 to 1913 was among the most prominent free speech fights of the IWW. An ordinance had been passed by the San Diego Common Council which made it much more difficult for the Wobblies to engage in their soapbox orations without being swiftly arrested. The San Diego jails were soon teeming with Wobblies and others who used civil disobedience in the fight for free speech, and, even more alarmingly, contingents of vigilantes arose to fight against those in favor of free speech. The Free Speech League worked in concert with the IWW in San Diego, but, when the fight became judicial, the ordinance was upheld.

===Sioux City, Iowa===

Sioux City was considered a very strategic town for workers to stage free speech fights in because it was "a gateway for laborers entering and leaving summer employment in agriculture and construction in the Dakotas."  Since those employment opportunities for the workers were seasonal, many of them returned to spend the winter in Sioux City, where the Wobblies attempted to provide them incentives to join their Free Speech Fight such as by educating them and helping feed them over the tough winter. 

Over a thousand men were unemployed in Sioux City at the time during the winter of 1915. There had been a real push to get workers to come to Sioux City by business leaders there, but workers who arrived found that there were barely enough jobs for the local laborers. 
On the 15th of January, after facing even harsher conditions and struggling with unemployment, roughly 150 of the IWW-associated unemployed stormed the Commercial Club where many business leaders listened to them demand work and watched them take food. 

In response to the direct action of the IWW, Sioux City increased enforcement of vagrancy laws and began arresting more of the IWW members engaged in the Free Speech Fights. Their goal in doing so was to attempt to drive the IWW out of town, but, unsurprisingly, they achieved the opposite. The IWW demanded free speech rights to be granted in the city. They Wobblies were filling the city's jails and forced the hand of the city officials to attempt to strike a deal with them. Ultimately, they won the fight and free speech rights were granted to workers in Sioux City.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Indispensable Outcasts: Hobo Workers and Community in the American Midwest, 1880-1930|last=Higbie|first=Frank|publisher=University of Illinois Press|year=2003|isbn=978-0-252-07098-3|location=Urbana|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other free speech fights of the IWW===

The IWW followed with other free speech fights in [[Kansas City, Missouri]]; in [[Aberdeen, Washington|Aberdeen]] and [[Wenatchee, Washington]]; and in [[Fresno, California]].&lt;ref name="Hobo Orator Union"&gt;{{cite thesis |type=Ph.D |last=May |first=Matthew S. |title=Hobo Orator Union: The Free Speech Fights of the Industrial Workers of the World, 1909-1916 |date=July 2009 |publisher=[[University of Minnesota]] |url=http://conservancy.umn.edu/bitstream/handle/11299/53722/1/May_umn_0130E_10548.pdf |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Tarring and feathering|Tar and feathers]], beatings, clubbings, and forcible deportations were used in addition to incarceration. The San Diego free speech fight was unique in that the IWW did not have a specific organizing campaign at stake. The IWW won all of these free speech fights.&lt;ref name="Rayback-244" /&gt;

In early 1913, IWW members in [[Denver, Colorado]] fought [[History of Denver, Colorado#Labor unions|a lengthy free speech fight]]. Denver authorities had refused to allow the Wobblies to speak on street corners, so union members filled the jails for months. The union won the right to speak to workers, and within a year had formed two Denver branches.&lt;ref name="Brundage-161-162"&gt;Brundage, pp.161-62.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other locations of free speech fights by the IWW included [[Duluth, Minnesota]]; [[Portland, Oregon]]; [[New Castle, Pennsylvania]], and [[New Bedford, Massachusetts]].&lt;ref name="BoyerMorais-174" /&gt;

===The IWW's provocative free speech message===

The IWW message was particularly unpopular with the business community. IWW members believed that the capitalist system was corrupt, could not be reformed, and could only be resisted until a better society could be built for all working people. James Walsh's streetcorner speeches were therefore frequently disrupted, particularly by the local Volunteers of America and Salvation Army Bands.

Walsh recruited volunteers to put together a small band, equipped with "a big booming bass drum," in order to get the IWW's message to listeners. The group practiced patriotic and religious tunes of the period, but the Wobblies wrote new words to the songs.&lt;ref name="Blecha"&gt;Blecha, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"To grab the crowd's attention," the IWW band often "hid in a doorway while one member dressed in a bowler hat and carrying a briefcase and umbrella, yelled to the crowd, 'Help! I've been robbed!' The crowd rushed over only to hear, 'I've been robbed by the capitalist system! Fellow workers ...' He then launched into a short speech, and the makeshift band stepped out of the doorway and played their songs."
&lt;ref name="Blecha-Allen"&gt;Blecha, 2006, citing Linda Allen, ''Washington Songs and Lore'' (Spokane: Melior Publications 1988), p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===The soapbox tradition===
Prior to television, radio, and film becoming parts of American mass culture, public speaking was a primary medium for entertainment and information. Politicians, religious zealots, and newsboys all pitched their trade on the [[soapbox]]. Though not all street speakers were political, soapbox oration was fundamentally a political act. 

With the march of time of the 20th century, police forces and city ordinances began to take away the rights of soapbox orators. As television and radio became more prominent, the very act of street speaking began to seem antiquated and, at the very least, irrelevant. Street speaking represented a threat to upper- and middle-class white Americans who feared that "inter-ethnoracial, working-class political coalitions" would achieve influence through the soap box. 

This was especially true in Los Angeles, where class politics was reaching a fever pitch in the early 20th century. A multitude of political groups, such as the IWW, the Socialists, the Communist Party, and the Partido Liberal Mexicano all spoke out for Angelinos to fight for the rights of the underprivileged.

===Socialist free speech fights: 1900–1911===
In the early 20th century, it was the Socialist Party that led the charge in soapbox oration. They were the first group to make effective use of the tactics of public speaking. Over the first ten years of the city, they grew enough to gain significant political clout. In Los Angeles, the party drew in skilled and semi-skilled white workers who worried about their job security. Additionally, they attempted to recruit central Angelinos from more diverse ethnic backgrounds. In this way, Free Speech Fights in Los Angeles served as the battleground between central Los Angeles workers and the rest of the city.

===The World War I crackdown===
In the 1910s and 1920s, street speaking in Los Angeles suffered from increasing escalation of tactics by the LAPD and city ordinances. The Wobblies became the more dominant social group after the Socialists lost power, but the IWW was unable to draw nearly as many people to their soapbox speeches.

The IWW had a major conflict with the police over public speaking in San Pedro, a harbor community. They organized with striking dockworkers, but were met with extreme repression by the police who even used violent tactics to prevent their protests from being successful.  Because of the failures in San Pedro, the IWW lost power in Southern California.

{{primary|date=May 2015}}

'''General Responsibility Assignment Software Patterns''' (or '''Principles'''), abbreviated '''GRASP''', consist of guidelines for assigning responsibility to classes and objects in [[object-oriented design]]. It is not related to the [[SOLID]] design principle.

The different patterns and principles used in GRASP are controller, creator, indirection, information expert, high [[cohesion (computer science)|cohesion]], low [[coupling (computer science)|coupling]], [[Polymorphism (object-oriented programming)|polymorphism]], protected variations, and pure fabrication. All these patterns answer some [[software]] problem, and these problems are common to almost every [[software development]] project. These techniques have not been invented to create new ways of working, but to better document and standardize old, tried-and-tested [[Computer programming|programming]] principles in object-oriented design. 

Computer scientist [[Craig Larman]] states that "the critical design tool for software development is a mind well educated in design principles. It is not [[Unified Modeling Language|UML]] or any other technology."{{sfn|Larman|2005|p = 272}} Thus, GRASP are really a mental toolset, a learning aid to help in the design of object-oriented software.

== Patterns ==
In OO design, a pattern is a named description of a problem and solution that can be applied to new contexts; ideally, a pattern advises us on how to apply its solution in varying circumstances and considers the forces and trade-offs. Many patterns, given a specific category of problem, guide the assignment of responsibilities to objects. 

=== Controller ===

The '''controller''' pattern assigns the responsibility of dealing with system events to a non-[[User Interface|UI]] class that represents the overall system or a [[use case]] scenario. A controller object is a non-user interface object responsible for receiving or handling a system event.

A use case controller should be used to deal with ''all'' system events of a use case, and may be used for more than one use case (for instance, for use cases ''Create User'' and ''Delete User'', one can have a single class called ''UserController'', instead of two separate use case controllers(This may save some space)).

The controller is defined as the first object beyond the UI layer that receives and coordinates ("controls") a system operation. The controller should delegate the work that needs to be done to other objects; it coordinates or controls the activity. It should not do much work itself. The GRASP Controller can be thought of as being a part of the application/service layer &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=https://groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/domaindrivendesign/conversations/messages/7582
|title=Application Layer like business facade?
|work=Yahoo! Groups (domaindrivendesign)
|accessdate=15 July 2010
}}&lt;/ref&gt; (assuming that the application has made an explicit distinction between the application/service layer and the [[domain layer]]) in an object-oriented system with common layers in an information system logical architecture.

===Creator===
{{see also|Factory pattern}}
Creation of objects is one of the most common activities in an object-oriented system. Which class is responsible for creating objects is a fundamental property of the relationship between objects of particular classes.
 
In general, a class &lt;code&gt;B&lt;/code&gt; should be responsible for creating instances of class &lt;code&gt;A&lt;/code&gt; if one, or preferably more, of the following apply:
* Instances of &lt;code&gt;B&lt;/code&gt; contain or compositely aggregate instances of &lt;code&gt;A&lt;/code&gt;
* Instances of &lt;code&gt;B&lt;/code&gt; record instances of &lt;code&gt;A&lt;/code&gt;
* Instances of &lt;code&gt;B&lt;/code&gt; closely use instances of &lt;code&gt;A&lt;/code&gt;
* Instances of &lt;code&gt;B&lt;/code&gt; have the initializing information for instances of &lt;code&gt;A&lt;/code&gt; and pass it on creation.

===High cohesion===
{{main|Cohesion (computer science)}}
'''High cohesion''' is an evaluative pattern that attempts to keep objects appropriately focused, manageable and understandable. High cohesion is generally used in support of low coupling. High cohesion means that the responsibilities of a given element are strongly related and highly focused. Breaking programs into classes and subsystems is an example of activities that increase the cohesive properties of a system. Alternatively, low cohesion is a situation in which a given element has too many unrelated responsibilities. Elements with low cohesion often suffer from being hard to comprehend, hard to reuse, hard to maintain and averse to change.&lt;ref name="larman314"&gt;{{Harvnb|Larman|2005|pp=314&amp;ndash;315}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Information expert===
{{see also|Information hiding}}
'''Information expert''' (also '''expert''' or the '''expert principle''') is a principle used to determine where to delegate responsibilities. These responsibilities include methods, computed fields, and so on. 

Using the principle of information expert, a general approach to assigning responsibilities is to look at a given responsibility, determine the information needed to fulfill it, and then determine where that information is stored. 

Information expert will lead to placing the responsibility on the class with the most information required to fulfill it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Larman|2005}} chapter 17, section 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Low coupling===
{{main|Loose coupling}}
Coupling is a measure of how strongly one element is connected to, has knowledge of, or relies on other elements. '''Low coupling''' is an evaluative pattern that dictates how to assign responsibilities to support
* lower dependency between the classes,
* change in one class having lower impact on other classes,
* higher reuse potential.

===Polymorphism===
{{main|Polymorphism in object-oriented programming}}
According to '''polymorphism''' principle, responsibility of defining the variation of behaviors based on type is assigned to the type for which this variation happens. This is achieved using [[Polymorphism (computer science)|polymorphic]] operations. The user of the type should use polymorphic operations instead of explicit branching based on type.

===Protected variations===
{{see also|Open/closed principle}}
The '''protected variations''' pattern protects elements from the variations on other elements (objects, systems, subsystems) by wrapping the focus of instability with an [[Interface (computer science)|interface]] and using [[Polymorphism (computer science)|polymorphism]] to create various implementations of this interface.

===Pure fabrication===
{{see also|Service (systems architecture)}}
A '''pure fabrication''' is a class that does not represent a concept in the problem domain, specially made up to achieve low coupling, high cohesion, and the reuse potential thereof derived (when a solution presented by the ''information expert'' pattern does not). This kind of class is called a "service" in [[domain-driven design]].

===Indirection===
The indirection pattern supports low coupling and reuse potential between two elements by assigning the responsibility of mediation between them to an intermediate object. An example of this is the introduction of a controller component for mediation between data(model) and its representation(view) in the model-view control pattern.This ensures that coupling between them remains low.

'''Gender feminism''' is a [[Feminist movements and ideologies|subdivision of feminism]] based on the view that the [[Social construction of gender|gender differences are social constructs]] perpetrated by men in order to maintain dominance over women.&lt;ref name="Oxford_dict"&gt;{{cite web | title = Gender feminism (definition) | url = https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/gender_feminism | publisher = Oxford Dictionaries }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hoff_Sommers" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pinker 2003"/&gt;

== History ==

Prior to the usage of the term ''gender feminism'' [[Gayle Rubin]]'s essay ''[[Gayle Rubin#"The Traffic in Women: Notes on the 'Political Economy' of Sex"|The Traffic in Women: Notes on the "Political Economy" of Sex]]'' (1975) was published. In it she devised the phrase "sex/gender system", defining it as "the set of arrangements by which a society transforms biological sexuality into products of human activity, and in which these transformed sexual needs are satisfied."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Rubin | first = Gayle | author-link = Gayle Rubin | chapter = The traffic in women: notes on the ‘political economy’ of sex | chapter-url = http://www.umsl.edu/~gradyf/theory/sexgender.htm | editor-last = Reiter | editor-first = Rayna R. | editor-link = Rayna Rapp | title = Toward an anthropology of women | page = 159 | publisher = Aakar Books | location = Delhi | year = 2011 | orig-year = 1975 | isbn = 9789350021620 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the same year [[Sandra Lee Bartky]], founding member of the [[Society for Women in Philosophy]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Roberts | first = Sam | title = Sandra Lee Bartky, at the vanguard of feminist philosophy, dies at 81 | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/24/us/sandra-lee-bartky-dead.html | work = [[The New York Times]] | date = 23 October 2016 | access-date = 29 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; wrote the essay, ''Toward a Phenomenology of Feminist Consciousness'',&lt;ref name=Bartky_Phenomenology&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Bartky | first = Sandra Lee | author-link = Sandra Bartky | title = Toward a phenomenology of feminist consciousness | journal = [[Social Theory and Practice]] | volume = 3 | issue = 4 | pages = 425&amp;ndash;439 | date = Fall 1975 | jstor = 23557163 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}

As long as their situation is apprehended as natural, inevitable, and inescapable, women's consciousness of themselves, no matter how alive to insult and inferiority, is not yet feminist consciousness... The very meaning of what the feminist apprehends is illuminated by the light of what ought to be."&lt;ref name="Bartky_Phenomenology" /&gt;

In 1983 the philosopher [[Alison Jaggar]] wrote of the need for a new name for the direction that [[socialist feminism]] was taking. "Socialist feminism," she said, "has indicated a new domain for political economy; it has identified the questions that feminist political theory must ask, and it has shown the sorts of answers that are acceptable. However, socialist feminism has not yet provided the answers, in part because of continuing uncertainty about how the redefined domain of political economy should be conceptualized."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Jaggar | first = Alison M. | author-link = Alison Jaggar | chapter = Socialist feminism and human nature | chapter-url = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=xVI6ZYDkDSYC&amp;pg=PA155 | title = Feminist politics and human nature | page = 155 | publisher = Rowman &amp; Allanheld | location = Totowa, N.J | year = 1983 | isbn = 9780847672547}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1980s the philosopher [[Christina Hoff Sommers]] criticized the attempt to increase the amount of [[feminist philosophy]] being taught making reference to what she called ''academic feminism''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Sommers | first = Christina |authorlink=Christina Hoff Sommers | title = Should the academy support academic feminism? | journal = [[Public Affairs Quarterly]] | volume = 2 | issue = 3 | pages = 97&amp;ndash;120 | date = July 1988 | jstor = 40435687}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Sommers | first = Christina |authorlink=Christina Hoff Sommers | title = Feminist philosophers are oddly unsympathetic to the women they claim to represent | journal = [[The Chronicle of Higher Education]] | date = 11 October 1989 | url = https://www.chronicle.com/article/Feminist-Philosophers-Are/66921}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''gender feminism'' was first used by ''[[New York Magazine|The New York Magazine]]'' in the early 1990s.&lt;ref name="Oxford_dict" /&gt; In 1994 Sommers used the term to criticize Rubin, Bartky, Jaggar and other feminists in her book, ''[[Who Stole Feminism?|Who Stole Feminism? How Women Have Betrayed Women]]''.&lt;ref name=Hoff_Sommers_P&gt;{{cite book | last = Hoff Sommers | first = Christina |authorlink=Christina Hoff Sommers | chapter = Preface | chapterurl = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=EIUtJziqIqAC&amp;pg=PA16 | title = Who stole feminism? How women have betrayed women | page = 16 | publisher = Touchstone/Simon &amp; Schuster | location = New York | year = 1995 | isbn = 9780684801568 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote|text=American feminism is currently dominated by a group of women who seek to persuade the public that American women are not the free creatures we think we are&amp;nbsp;... The feminists who hold this divisive view of our social and political reality believe we are in a gender war, and they are eager to disseminate stories of atrocity that are designed to alert women to their plight. The "gender feminists" (as I shall call them) believe that all our institutions, from the state to the family to the grade schools, perpetuate male dominance. Believing that women are virtually under siege, gender feminists naturally seek recruits to their side of the gender war. They seek support. They seek vindication. They seek ammunition.  |author=Christina Hoff Sommers |authorlink=Christina Hoff Sommers  |source=''[[Who Stole Feminism?]]'' (1994)&lt;ref name="Hoff_Sommers_P" /&gt;}}

Retrospectively Jaggar stated that prior to the publication of ''Who Stole Feminism?'', "Sommers was establishing her reputation as a defender of so-called traditional family values against those whom she called radical "gender feminists," a term she invented [in her book] to refer to any feminist who had moved beyond the ideas of nineteenth-century philosopher, [[John Stuart Mill]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Jaggar | first = Alison M. | author-link = Alison Jaggar | chapter = Whose politics?

=== Supporters of gender feminism ===

==== Nussbaum ====
Philosopher [[Martha Nussbaum]] puts forward a set of questions are raised when considering the future of feminism in America:
# What do American women have to complain of?
# Has the thought of radical feminists made a positive contribution to social justice and to the well-being of American women?
# Does the common feminist claim that many women's preferences and desires are distorted by a legacy of injustice pose a threat to democracy?&lt;ref name="Nussbaum_1999"&gt;{{cite book | last = Nussbaum | first = Martha | author-link = Martha Nussbaum | chapter = American women: preferences, feminism, democracy | chapter-url = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=7zoaKIolT9oC&amp;pg=PA131 | title = Sex and Social Justice | pages = 131&amp;ndash;133 | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = New York | year = 1999 | isbn = 9780195355017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|131}}

Comparing the advantages that American women have to women in developing countries, Nussbaum states that Sommers seems to think that women have no urgent complaints to press and she is critical of Sommers for not saying what she thinks about "legal developments aimed at securing full political and social equality for women&amp;nbsp;... [e.g.] laws against sexual harassment and marital rape." By not stating her views, Nussbaum says, "it is difficult to tell how close [Sommers] really is to the 'grass-roots constituency' that she claims to be representing."&lt;ref name="Nussbaum_1999" /&gt;{{rp|132–133}}

{{Quote|text=A gender feminist, for Sommers, is any thinker who believes that (1) women's suffrage did not remove a systemic asymmetry of power between women and men in our society, and/or (2) the existing preferences of women and men in our society concerning gender issues may be corrupted by social forces and not always reliable bases for the formation of social policy&amp;nbsp;... this definition is not ultimately helpful in sorting feminists into two categories ["gender feminists" or "[[equity feminists]]"] because it fits almost all contemporary social thinkers in political thought and economics.  |author=Martha Nussbaum |authorlink=Martha Nussbaum |source=''Sex and Social Justice'' (1999)&lt;ref name="Nussbaum_1999" /&gt;}}

However, Nussbaum states that it provides a way of reframing her original set of questions about the future of feminism in America:
# Do American women have complaints that have not been adequately addressed by the agenda of "[[equity feminism]]"? In other words, do they have good reasons to become "gender feminists"?
# Does the thought of [[radical feminist]] thinkers make a valuable contribution to addressing those complaints?
# Do the views of these "gender feminist thinkers" about preferences and desires pose a threat to democracy? 
The first two questions Nussbaum answers with a "yes" and the third with a "no."&lt;ref name="Nussbaum_1999" /&gt;{{rp|133}}

&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Opponents of gender feminism ===

==== Sommers ====
Sommers endorses [[equity feminism]] which she equates with [[first-wave feminism]], rooted in the philosophy of [[liberalism]]. She distinguishes this perspective from [[second-wave feminism]] or gender feminism, which she describes as regarding all women as oppressed by an all-encompassing system of [[patriarchy]].&lt;ref name="Hoff_Sommers" /&gt;{{rp|22}} She further describes gender feminists as supporting [[difference feminism]], quoting authors who asserts that standards for good art are gendered.&lt;ref name=Hoff_Sommers&gt;{{cite book | last = Hoff Sommers | first = Christina |authorlink=Christina Hoff Sommers | chapter = Women under siege | chapterurl = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=EIUtJziqIqAC&amp;pg=PA22 | title = Who stole feminism? How women have betrayed women | publisher = Touchstone/Simon &amp; Schuster | location = New York | year = 1995 | isbn = 9780684801568 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|64}} For Sommers, gender or ''political feminism'' is defined in opposition to [[individualist feminism]].&lt;ref name="Hoff_Sommers" /&gt;

==== McElroy ====
[[Wendy McElroy]] also defines gender or political feminism in opposition to individualist feminism,&lt;ref name=mcelroy1&gt;{{cite book | last = McElroy | first = Wendy | author-link = Wendy McElroy | chapter = Introduction | chapterurl = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=3BYpAAAAYAAJ | title = Liberty for women: freedom and feminism in the twenty-first century | page = 14 | publisher = Ivan R. Dee | location = Chicago | year = 2002 | isbn = 9781566634359 |quote=Ideologically speaking, individualist and radical or gender feminism are mirror images of each other}}&lt;/ref&gt; and synonymous with [[radical feminism]].&lt;ref name=mcelroy1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=mcelroy2&gt;{{cite journal | last = McElroy | first = Wendy | author-link = Wendy McElroy | title = Gender feminism and Ifeminism: wherin they differ | journal = Ethics &amp; Politics [Etica &amp; Politica] | volume = V | issue = 2  | date = 2003 |hdl=10077/5456 | quote = As a school within the broader feminist tradition, individual feminism contrasts sharply with gender feminism both in its theory and its history. Indeed the two schools define the ideological extremes of the feminist movement |url=http://www2.units.it/etica/2003_2/mcelroy.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;
McElroy describes gender feminism as rooted in social constructionism. She describes gender feminists as asserting that women lack agency and are solely defined by the social institutions they inhabit, unable to make free choices. Accordingly, McElroy describes the gender feminist agenda as the destruction or transformation of social institutions. McElroy rejects these views as a means of disregarding the free choices of women to support existing institutions and oppose gender feminism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = McElroy | first = Wendy | author-link = Wendy McElroy | title = Religion and American feminism | journal = [[Society (journal)|Society]] | volume = 42 | issue = 3 | pages = 28&amp;ndash;31 | doi = 10.1007/bf02802983 | date = March 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|29}}

==== Pinker ====
[[Steven Pinker]], in his book, ''The Blank Slate: The Modern Denial of Human Nature'', elaborating on the dichotomy of Hoff Sommers, states that gender feminism is allied with [[Marxism]], [[postmodernism]], and [[social constructionism]], and as such  is based on three claims: gender differences are purely socially constructed and have no biological basis, human behavior is shaped by the single motive of [[Will to power|desire for power]], and human interactions are best understood not from individual psychology but from the motives of groups responding to groups.&lt;ref name="pinker 2003"&gt;{{cite book | last = Pinker | first = Steven | chapter = Hot buttons: Gender | chapter-url = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=G3_UAeo8Dh0C&amp;pg=PT509 | title = The blank slate: the modern denial of human nature | pages = 341–343 | publisher = Penguin | location = London | year = 2003 | isbn = 9780140276053 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|341–342}} Pinker endorses Hoff Sommers' contrast of gender feminism  vs. equity feminism, with the latter seen as making a moral claim in favor of legal and social equality without making particular assertions about human behavior or biology. He regards [[difference feminism]] as an offshoot of gender feminism.&lt;ref name="pinker 2003" /&gt;{{rp|343}}

=== Relation to other forms of feminism ===
It has been used to distinguish perceived [[radical feminism]] and [[liberal feminism]].&lt;ref name=Sep92&gt;{{cite journal | last = Beckwith | first = Francis J. | title = Reply to Keenan: Thomson's argument and academic feminism | journal = [[International Philosophical Quarterly]] | volume = 32 | issue = 3 | pages = 369–376 | doi = 10.5840/ipq199232321 | date = September 1992 }}

He is the founder of the art centre [[ArtBakery]] in [[Bonendale]], Cameroon and he was the [[curator]] and promoter of site-specific art and international projects. His role was central in the cultural and art scene in Cameroon and at the international level.

== Life and career ==
Goddy Leye (real name Godfried Kadjo&lt;ref&gt;[[Simon Njami]], ''Dans la ville et au-delà'', Marval, 2007, p. 260.&lt;/ref&gt;) was born 24 November 1965 in [[Mbouda]], Cameroon. He obtained his diploma at a bilingual high school in 1989 and studied African literature and philology at the [[University of Yaoundé]] between 1986 and 1991. In 1990 he obtain his master's in African literature. 
His artistic training started in 1987 with the artist and art historian [[Pascal Kenfack]] in Yaoundé until 1992. He continued his training in 1994 at the National Art Institute in [[Bamako]], in 1997 at the ZKM Karlsruhe Centre for Art and Media in Germany, in 1999 at 18th Street Arts Complex in [[Santa Monica]], California and between 2002 and 2002 at the [[Rijksakademie|Rijksakademie van Beeldende Kunsten]] in Amsterdam. In the [[Netherlands]] he co-funds and he becomes member of the [[Rijksakademie]] International Network (RAIN), a network of artists who support contemporary cultural practices in their countries of origin.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.r-a-i-n.net RAIN network and website]&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically for his interest in supporting art practices, Leye moved back to [[Douala]] in 2002 to create the art centre ArtBakery in Bonendale, devoted specifically to facilitating artistic training and exchanges among artists and to support multimedia, installations, video and digital art.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.r-a-i-n.net/projects/art+bakery/ ArtBakery on RAIN website].&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002 he was the curator of the project ''Bessengue City'', a workshop and a series of site-specific art projects in the neighbourhood of [[Bessengue]] in Douala; the project involved Goddy Leye, James Beckett, Hartanto, [[Jesus Palomino]] and the local community.&lt;ref&gt;Video on Bessengue City: [[Sandrine Dole]] and Goddy Leye, ''Bessengue City'', 2002–2003.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006 he promoted and participated in ''Exit Tour''. In 2007 contributed to the Ars&amp;Urbis Workshop organised in Douala by [[doual'art]] for the preparation of the [[SUD Salon Urbain de Douala]] and he was in residency at the [[Blachère Foundation]] in [[Apt, Vaucluse|Apt]], France. In 2008 he was in residency at the Gasworks cultural space in London;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gasworks.org.uk/residencies/detail.php?id=356 Goddy Leye's residency at Gasworks] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101204223257/http://www.gasworks.org.uk/residencies/detail.php?id=356 |date=4 December 2010 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; in 2009 he participated at the project ''Image Art After'' in dialogue with [[Florence Ayisi]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://imagineartafter.org/dialogues/dialogues-2009/goddy-leye-and-florence-ayisi/ Imagine Art After].&lt;/ref&gt; and he contributed at the Cairo Residency Symposium.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crs.nu/Cairo_Residency_Symposium/Info_art_bakery.html Goddy Leye at the Cairo Residency Symposium] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724190346/http://www.crs.nu/Cairo_Residency_Symposium/Info_art_bakery.html |date=24 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Leye's work received prizes from [[UNESCO]], the [[Rockefeller Foundation]] and the [[Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lowave.com/?language=EN&amp;section=artists&amp;id_artist=148 Goddy Leye's biography on lowave].&lt;/ref&gt; As an artist and intellectual, he was involved in numerous expert committees; he was a member of the think tank of the Africa Centre in Cape Town and was an ambassador of CAN (Creative Africa Network).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.creativeafricanetwork.com CAN Creative Africa Network].&lt;/ref&gt;

== Work ==
Leye started working as an artist in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;[http://goddyleye.lecktronix.net/favorite_links_1.html Goddy Leye'CV on his website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723180604/http://goddyleye.lecktronix.net/favorite_links_1.html |date=23 July 2011 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; His work was focussed on memory, African [[postcolonialism]] and on the construction of history. More specifically he expressed himself with multimedia works, videos and video installations. Through time, he started to be involved more and more in the production of projects both in Cameroon and at an international level. He contributed to publications, produced and curated site-specific artworks and founded the centre ArtBakery. The centre offers tools and an infrastructure to artists interested in multimedia productions and it is characterised by an active role in training. Leye was considered a key artist and intellectual by Cameroonian artists of his generation and younger.

Leye expressed his attention to the ways history is told and knowledge is transmitted and forgotten through his art works, writings and his active involvement in conferences and think tanks. His theoretical contributions focused on the structure of cultural institutions, on network systems, on artistic and cultural practices&lt;ref&gt;[http://dailymotion.virgilio.it/video/x69rs4_goddye-leye_creation Video with a conversation on artistic practices] between Goddy Leye, [[Lionel Manga]] and [[Hervé Yamguen]].&lt;/ref&gt; and on urban transformations.

{{Eschatology}}
'''Hindu eschatology''' is linked in the [[Vaishnavite]] tradition to the figure of [[Kalki]], or the tenth and last [[avatar]] of [[Vishnu]] or [[Shiva]] names of the [[Supreme Being]] in Hinduism and before the age draws to a close, and [[Harihara]] simultaneously dissolves and regenerates the universe.

The current period is [[Kali Yuga]], the last of four ''Yuga'' that make up the current age. Each period has seen a progressive decline in morality, to the point that in Kali Yuga quarrel and hypocrisy are norm. In Hinduism, time is cyclic, consisting of cycles or "[[Kalpa (aeon)|kalpas]]". Each kalpa lasts 8.64 billion years, which is a period of one full day and night for [[Brahma]], who in turn will live for 311 trillion, 40 billion years. The cycle of [[Brahma|birth]], [[Vishnu|growth]], [[Shiva|decay]], and renewal at the individual level finds its echo in the cosmic order, yet is affected by the vagaries of divine intervention in Vaishnavism. Some Shaivites hold the view that he is incessantly destroying and creating the world.

After this larger cycle, all of creation will contract to a [[Mathematical singularity|singularity]] and then again will expand from that single point, as the [[yuga|ages]] continue in a religious [[fractal]] pattern.&lt;ref name="Hooper"&gt;{{cite book|last = Hooper| first= Rev.

{{Hindu philosophy}}

==The Four Yugas==
Within the current ''kalpa'', there are four ''yugas'', or epochs, that encompass the evolution of this specific cycle. These ages encompass a beginning of complete purity to a descent into total decay.

* [[Satya Yuga]] lasts 1.728 million years.
* [[Treta Yuga]] lasts 1.296 million years.
* [[Dvapara Yuga]] lasts 864,000 years.
* [[Kali Yuga]] lasts 432,000 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sanskrit.org/www/Hindu%20Primer/yugatime.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-01-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140223140604/http://www.sanskrit.org/www/Hindu%20Primer/yugatime.html |archivedate=23 February 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kali Yuga===
[[Kali Yuga]], the last of the four ages, is the one in which we currently reside. This epoch has been foretold to be characterized by impiety, violence, and decay. As written in the [[Puranas|Vishnu Purana]] in 100 BCE:

{{quote|Social status depends not upon your accomplishments, but in the ownership of property; wealth is now the source of virtue; passion and luxury are the sole bonds between spouses; falsity and lying are the conditions of success in life; sexuality is the sole source of human enjoyment; religion, a superficial and empty ritual, is confused with spirituality|Vishnu Purana&lt;ref name="Hooper"/&gt;}}

The fourth age is ruled over by [[Kali (demon)|Kali]], not the goddess [[Kali]] but the [[Kali (demon)|demon Kali]].&lt;ref name="Hooper"/&gt; Puranas go on to write that kings in the fourth age will be godless, wanting in tranquility, quick to anger, and dishonest. They will inflict death on women, and children, and will rise and fall to power quickly. Undisciplined barbarians will receive the support of rulers.

From the four pillars of [[dharma]]—penance, charity, truthfulness, and compassion—charity will be all that remains, although it too will decrease daily. People will commit sin in mind, speech and action. Plague, famine, pestilence and natural calamities will appear. People will not believe one another, falsehoods will win disputes and brothers will become avaricious. As the each age progresses, the human life span decreases, starting from thousands of years in the Krutha Yuga to 100 years in the current Kali Yuga.&lt;ref name="Hooper"/&gt;

Sannyasins will wear red. There will be many false religions, and many will profess false knowledge to earn their livelihood. Life will be short and miserable. Marriage will be for pleasure alone. Being dry of water will be the only definition of land, and any hard to reach water will define a pilgrimage destination. People will hide in valleys between mountains, and suffering from cold and exposure, people will wear clothes of tree bark and leaves. People will live less than twenty-three years and the pretense of greatness will be the proof of it. Ultimately, humankind will be destroyed.&lt;ref name="Brown"/&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.astrojyoti.com/vishnupurana.htm |title = Vishnu Purana |publisher = Astrojyoti.com |date = |accessdate = 2011-11-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Kalki==
{{Main|Kalki}}
[[File:Kalki.jpg|thumb|left|Kalki leading his white horse]]At this time of evil, the final incarnation of Vishnu known as [[Kalki]] will appear on a white horse. He will amass an army of those few pious souls remaining. These, together with all the incarnations of the Godhead (avatars) which have appeared throughout human history, will destroy all demons and sins in the world.

As written in the [[Bhagavad Gita|Gita]]:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;poem&gt;:Yadaa Yadaa hi Dharmasya Glaanir bhavati Bhaarata
:Abhyuthaanam Adharmasya Tadaatmaanam Srjaamy Aham.

:Whenever there is decay of righteousness O! Bharatha
:And a rise of unrighteousness then I manifest Myself!&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/m06/m06025.htm |title=The Mahabharata, Book 6, Bhagavad Gita Chapter IV, Section 7|publisher=Sacred-texts.com|accessdate = 12 Nov 2012|date = 12 Nov 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;

Aditi is the mother of the eight Adityas or solar deities. At the end of creation these eight suns will shine together in the skies. Kalki will amass an army to "establish righteousness upon the earth" and leave "the minds of the people as pure as crystal." Those left, transformed by virtue, will be the new seeds for a higher form of humanity, and humanity will begin again.&lt;ref name="Hooper"/&gt;

Puranas write: {{quote|When the sun and moon, the lunar constellation Tishya, and the planet Jupiter are all in one mansion, the Krita age shall return to the earth.|Hooper, 1508&lt;ref name="Hooper"/&gt;}}

At the completion of [[Kali Yuga]], the next epoch will begin, [[Satya Yuga]], in which everyone will be righteous with the reestablishment of dharma and piety. This, in turn, will be followed cyclically by epochs of Treta Yuga, Dwapara Yuga and again another Kali Yuga. This cycle will repeat till the larger cycle of existence under [[Brahma]] returns to the singularity and a new universe is born.&lt;ref name="Brown"&gt;{{cite book|last = Browne | first = Sylvia | authorlink = | title = End of Days: Predictions and Prophecies About the End of the World| publisher = | date = | location = | pages = | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=bAAOiMl1BIcC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | doi = | id =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Brahma Kumaris===
Within Hinduism, there are more distinguishing scenarios in certain sects. [[Benjamin Beit-Hallahmi]] of the [[Brahma Kumari]] has written that their prediction of the imminent end of the world is hidden from non-members.&lt;ref name="Beit-hallahmi2004"&gt;{{cite journal |author = Beit-hallahmi, B. |date = 2004 |title = Death, Fantasy, and Religious Transformations |journal = The Psychology of Death in Fantasy and History |url = https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;id=SjIKL5q8HrEC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA87&amp;dq=bkwsu&amp;ots=8JzjGa25Uy&amp;sig=4RWN7gdUstsYI5QCom8I175Nstk |quote = A case study of Brahma Kumaris, a contemporary group characterized by an apocalyptic vision (kept hidden from nonmembers). |accessdate = 2008-01-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Within their tradition, the majority of the planet is predicted to become submerged beneath the ocean, similar to the [[Ragnarök]] of Nordic mythology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last = Varughese |first = Suma |url = http://www.lifepositive.com/spirit/spirit-centers/bramha-kumari.asp |title = An article on the sect of the Brahma Kumaris in Rajasthan, India |publisher = Lifepositive.com |date =  |accessdate = 2011-11-21 |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20111128221137/http://www.lifepositive.com/Spirit/spirit-centers/bramha-kumari.asp |archivedate = 28 November 2011 |df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kalagnanam===
Sri [[Potuluri Virabrahmendra Swami]], wrote 400 years ago in his ''Divya Maha Kala Gnana,'' or 'Divine Knowledge of the Time,' that Kalki would arrive when the moon, sun, Venus and Jupiter entered the same sign. This is not a rare occurrence and last happened in early 2012, passing without event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Santanu Acharya |url=http://ww-iii.tripod.com/hindu.htm |title=Hindu Prophecies: Translations from the Kalki Purana |publisher=Ww-iii.tripod.com |date= |accessdate=2013-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="26489">In [[mathematics]], an '''iterated function''' is a function {{math|''X&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;X''}} (that is, a function from some [[Set (mathematics)|set]] {{mvar|X}} to itself) which is obtained  by [[function composition|composing]] another function {{math|''f''&amp;nbsp;:&amp;nbsp;''X&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;X''}} with itself a certain number of times. The process of repeatedly applying the same function is called [[iteration]]. In this process, starting from some initial number, the result of applying a given function is fed again in the function as input, and this process is repeated.

Iterated functions are objects of study in [[computer science]], [[fractals]],  [[dynamical system]]s, mathematics and [[renormalization group]] physics.

==Definition==
The formal definition of an iterated function on a [[Set (mathematics)|set]] ''X'' follows.

Let {{mvar|''X''}} be a set and {{math|''f:  X → X''}} be a [[function (mathematics)|function]].

Define {{math| ''f'' &lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}}  as the ''n''-th iterate  of {{mvar|''f''}}, where ''n'' is a non-negative integer, by:

:: &lt;math&gt;f^0 ~   \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=}  ~ \operatorname{id}_X&lt;/math&gt;
and
:: &lt;math&gt;f^{n+1} ~ \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=} ~ f \circ f^{n},&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|id&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the [[identity function]] on {{mvar|''X''}} and {{math|''f''○''g''}}  denotes [[function composition]]. That is, 
::{{math|(''f''○''g'')(''x'') {{=}} ''f'' (''g''(''x''))}}, 
always [[associative]].

Because the notation  {{math|''f'' &lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}} may refer to both iteration (composition) of the function {{mvar|''f''}} or [[Exponentiation#Exponential notation for function names|exponentiation of the function]] {{mvar|''f''}} (the latter is commonly used in [[Trigonometric functions|trigonometry]]), some mathematicians choose to write  {{math|''f'' °&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}} for the ''n''-th iterate  of the function {{mvar|''f''}}.

==Abelian property and iteration sequences==
In general, the following identity holds for all non-negative integers {{mvar|m}} and {{mvar|n}},

: &lt;math&gt;f^{m} \circ f^{n} =   f^{n} \circ f^{m} = f^{m+n}~.&lt;/math&gt;

This is structurally identical to the property of [[exponentiation]] that {{math|''a''&lt;sup&gt;''m''&lt;/sup&gt;''a''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; {{=}} ''a''&lt;sup&gt;''m''+''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}}, i.e. the special case {{math|''f''(''x''){{=}}''ax''}}.

In general, for arbitrary general (negative, non-integer, etc.) indices {{mvar|m}} and {{mvar|n}}, this relation is called the '''translation functional equation''', cf. [[Schröder's equation]] and [[Abel equation]]. On a logarithmic scale, this reduces to the '''nesting property''' of [[Chebyshev polynomials]],   {{math|''T''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt;(''T''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'')){{=}}''T''&lt;sub&gt;''m n''&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'')}}, since  {{math|''T''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'') {{=}} cos(''n'' arcos(''x'' ))}}.

The relation  {{math|(''f''&lt;sup&gt; ''m''&lt;/sup&gt; )&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;(''x'') {{=}} (''f''&lt;sup&gt; ''n''&lt;/sup&gt; )&lt;sup&gt;''m''&lt;/sup&gt;(''x'') {{=}} ''f''&lt;sup&gt; ''mn''&lt;/sup&gt;(''x'')}} also holds, analogous to the property of exponentiation that  {{math|(''a''&lt;sup&gt;''m''&lt;/sup&gt; )&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; {{=}}(''a''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; )&lt;sup&gt;''m''&lt;/sup&gt; {{=}} ''a''&lt;sup&gt;''mn''&lt;/sup&gt;}}.

The sequence of functions  {{math|''f'' &lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}} is called a '''Picard sequence''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Functional equations in a single variable |last=Kuczma |first=Marek| authorlink=Marek Kuczma|series=Monografie Matematyczne |year=1968 |publisher=PWN – Polish Scientific Publishers |location=Warszawa}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Iterative Functional Equations| last=Kuczma| first=M., Choczewski B., and Ger, R. |year=1990|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn= 0-521-35561-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; named after [[Charles Émile Picard]].

For a given {{mvar|x}} in {{mvar|X}}, the [[sequence]] of values  {{math|''f'' &lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;(''x'')}} is called the '''[[orbit (dynamics)|orbit]]''' of {{mvar|x}}.

If  {{math|''f'' &lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; (''x'') {{=}}  ''f'' &lt;sup&gt;''n''+''m''&lt;/sup&gt; (''x'')}} for some integer {{mvar|m}}, the orbit is called a '''periodic orbit'''.  The smallest such value of {{mvar|m}} for a given {{mvar|x}} is called the '''period of the orbit'''. The point {{mvar|x}} itself is called a [[periodic point]]. The [[cycle detection]] problem in computer science is the [[algorithm]]ic problem of finding the first periodic point in an orbit, and the period of the orbit.

==Fixed points==

If ''f''(''x'') = ''x'' for some ''x'' in ''X'' (that is, the period of the orbit of ''x'' is 1), then ''x'' is called a '''[[fixed point (mathematics)|fixed point]]''' of the iterated sequence.  The set of fixed points is often denoted as '''Fix'''(''f'' ).  There exist a number of [[fixed-point theorem]]s that guarantee the existence of fixed points in various situations, including the [[Banach fixed point theorem]] and the [[Brouwer fixed point theorem]].

There are several techniques for [[convergence acceleration]] of the sequences produced by [[fixed point iteration]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Carleson|first=L.
|last2= Gamelin|first2= T. D. W.|title=Complex dynamics|series=Universitext: Tracts in Mathematics|publisher= Springer-Verlag|year=1993 
|isbn=0-387-97942-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the [[Aitken method]] applied to an iterated fixed point is known as [[Steffensen's method]], and produces quadratic convergence.

==Limiting behaviour==

Upon iteration, one may find that there are sets that shrink and converge towards a single point. In such a case, the point that is converged to is known as an [[attractive fixed point]]. Conversely, iteration may give the appearance of points diverging away from a single point; this would be the case for an [[unstable fixed point]].&lt;ref&gt;Istratescu, Vasile  (1981).

When the points of the orbit converge to one or more limits, the set of [[accumulation point]]s of the orbit is known as the '''[[limit set]]''' or the '''ω-limit set'''.

The ideas of attraction and repulsion generalize similarly; one may categorize iterates into [[stable manifold|stable set]]s and [[unstable set]]s, according to the behaviour of small [[neighborhood]]s under iteration. (Also see [[Infinite compositions of analytic functions]].)

Other limiting behaviours are possible; for example, [[wandering point]]s are points that move away, and never come back even close to where they started.

==Invariant measure==
If one considers the evolution of a density distribution, rather than that of individual point dynamics, then the limiting behavior is given by the [[invariant measure]]. It can be visualized as the behavior of a point-cloud or dust-cloud under repeated iteration. The invariant measure is a eigenstate of the Ruelle-Frobenius-Perron operator or [[transfer operator]], corresponding to an eigenvalue of 1. Smaller eigenvalues correspond to unstable, decaying states.

In general, because repeated iteration corresponds to a shift, the transfer operator, and its adjoint, the [[Koopman operator]] can both be interpreted as [[shift operator]]s action on a [[shift space]].  The theory of [[subshifts of finite type]] provides general insight into many iterated functions, especially those leading to chaos.

==Fractional iterates and flows, and negative iterates==

In some instances,&lt;ref&gt;The notion {{math|''f''&lt;sup&gt;1/''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}} must be used with care when the equation {{math|''g''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;(''x'') {{=}} ''f''(''x'')}}  has multiple solutions, which is normally the case, as in [[Functional square root|Babbage's equation]] of the functional roots of the identity map. For example, for {{math|''n'' {{=}} 2}} and {{math|''f''(''x'') {{=}} 4''x''−6}}, both {{math|''g''(''x'') {{=}} 6−2''x''}} and {{math|''g''(''x'') {{=}} 2''x''−2}} are  solutions; so the expression {{math|''f''&lt;sup&gt; ½&lt;/sup&gt;(''x'')}} doesn't denote a unique function, just as algebraic roots of numbers are multiple. The issue is quite similar to [[division by zero#In algebra|division by zero]]. The roots chosen are normally the ones belonging to the orbit under study.&lt;/ref&gt; fractional iteration of a function can be defined:  for instance, a [[functional square root|half iterate]] of a function {{mvar|f}} is a function {{mvar|''g''}} such that {{math|''g''(''g''(''x'')) {{=}} ''f''(''x'')}}. This function {{math|''g''(''x'')}} can be written using the index notation as {{math|''f''&lt;sup&gt; ½&lt;/sup&gt;(''x'')}} . Similarly, {{math|''f''&lt;sup&gt; ⅓&lt;/sup&gt;(''x'')}} is the function defined such that {{math|''f''&lt;sup&gt;⅓&lt;/sup&gt;(''f''&lt;sup&gt;⅓&lt;/sup&gt;(''f''&lt;sup&gt;⅓&lt;/sup&gt;(''x''))) {{=}} ''f''(''x'')}}, while {{math|''f''&lt;sup&gt; ⅔&lt;/sup&gt;(''x'')}} may be defined equal to {{math|''f''&lt;sup&gt; ⅓&lt;/sup&gt;(''f''&lt;sup&gt; ⅓&lt;/sup&gt;(''x''))}}, and so forth, all based on the principle, mentioned earlier, that {{math|''f''&lt;sup&gt; ''m''&lt;/sup&gt;○''f''&lt;sup&gt; ''n''&lt;/sup&gt; {{=}} ''f''&lt;sup&gt; ''m'' + ''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}}. This idea can be generalized so that the iteration count {{mvar|n}} becomes a '''continuous parameter''', a sort of continuous "time" of a continuous [[Orbit (dynamics)|orbit]].

In such cases, one refers to the system as a [[flow (mathematics)|flow]], specified by [[Schröder's equation]]. (cf. Section on [[#Conjugacy|conjugacy]] below.)

Negative iterates correspond to function inverses and their compositions. For example, {{math|''f''&lt;sup&gt; &amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;(''x'')}} is the normal inverse of {{mvar|f}}, while {{math|''f''&lt;sup&gt; &amp;minus;2&lt;/sup&gt;(''x'')}} is the inverse composed with itself, i.e. {{math|''f''&lt;sup&gt; &amp;minus;2&lt;/sup&gt;(''x'') {{=}} ''f''&lt;sup&gt; &amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;(''f''&lt;sup&gt; &amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;(''x''))}}. Fractional negative iterates are defined analogously to fractional positive ones; for example, {{math|''f''&lt;sup&gt; &amp;minus;½&lt;/sup&gt;(''x'')}} is defined such that {{math|''f''&lt;sup&gt; &amp;minus; ½&lt;/sup&gt;(''f''&lt;sup&gt; &amp;minus;½&lt;/sup&gt;(''x'')) {{=}}  ''f''&lt;sup&gt; &amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;(''x'')}}, or, equivalently, such that {{math|''f''&lt;sup&gt; &amp;minus;½&lt;/sup&gt;(''f''&lt;sup&gt; ½&lt;/sup&gt;(''x'')) {{=}} ''f''&lt;sup&gt; 0&lt;/sup&gt;(''x'') {{=}} ''x''}}.

== Some formulas for fractional iteration==

One of several methods of finding a series formula for fractional iteration, making use of a fixed point, is as follows.

# First determine a fixed point for the function such that {{math|''f''(''a''){{=}}''a''}} .
# Define   {{math|''f &lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;''(''a''){{=}}''a''}} for all ''n'' belonging to the reals. This, in some ways, is the most natural extra condition to place upon the fractional iterates.
# Expand {{math|''f &lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;''(''x'')}}   around the fixed point ''a'' as a [[Taylor series]],
#:&lt;math&gt;
f^n(x) = f^n(a) + (x-a)\frac{d}{dx}f^n(x)|_{x=a} + \frac{(x-a)^2}2\frac{d^2}{dx^2}f^n(x)|_{x=a} +\cdots
&lt;/math&gt;
# Expand out
#:&lt;math&gt;
f^n\left(x\right) = f^n(a) + (x-a) f'(a)f'(f(a))f'(f^2(a))\cdots f'(f^{n-1}(a)) + \cdots
&lt;/math&gt;
#  Substitute in for   {{math|''f  &lt;sup&gt;k&lt;/sup&gt;''(''a''){{=}} ''a''}}, for any ''k'', 
#:&lt;math&gt;
f^n\left(x\right) = a + (x-a) f'(a)^{n} + \frac{(x-a)^2}2(f''(a)f'(a)^{n-1})\left(1+f'(a)+\cdots+f'(a)^{n-1}  \right)+\cdots
&lt;/math&gt;
# Make use of the [[geometric progression]] to simplify terms,
#:&lt;math&gt;
f^n\left(x\right) = a + (x-a) f'(a)^{n} + \frac{(x-a)^2}2(f''(a)f'(a)^{n-1})\frac{f'(a)^n-1}{f'(a)-1}+\cdots
&lt;/math&gt;
#* There is a special case when {{math|''f'' '(a){{=}}1}},
#:&lt;math&gt;
f^n\left(x\right) = x  + \frac{(x-a)^2}2(n f''(a))+ \frac{(x-a)^3}6\left(\frac{3}{2}n(n-1) f''(a)^2 + n f'''(a)\right)+\cdots
&lt;/math&gt;
# When ''n'' is not an integer, make use of the power formula {{math| ''y'' &lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; {{=}} exp(''n'' ln(''y''))}}.
This can be carried on indefinitely, although inefficiently, as the latter terms become increasingly complicated.
A more systematic procedure is outlined in the following section on '''Conjugacy'''.

===Example 1===
For example, setting {{math|''f''(''x'') {{=}} ''Cx''+''D''}}  gives the fixed point {{math|''a'' {{=}} ''D''/(1-''C'')}}, so  the above formula terminates to just
:&lt;math&gt;
f^n(x)=\frac{D}{1-C} + (x-\frac{D}{1-C})C^n=C^nx+\frac{1-C^n}{1-C}D ~,
&lt;/math&gt;
which is trivial to check.

===Example 2===
Find the value of &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{2}^{ \sqrt{2}^{\sqrt{2}^{\cdots}} }&lt;/math&gt; where this is done ''n'' times (and possibly the interpolated values when ''n'' is not an integer). We have {{math|''f''(''x''){{=}}{{sqrt|2}}&lt;sup&gt;''x''&lt;/sup&gt;}}. A fixed point is {{math|''a''{{=}}''f''(2){{=}}2}}.

So set ''x''=1 and {{math|''f'' &lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; (1)}} expanded around the fixed point value of 2 is then an infinite series,
:&lt;math&gt;
\sqrt{2}^{ \sqrt{2}^{\sqrt{2}^{\cdots}} } = f^n(1) = 2  - (\ln 2)^n +  \frac{(\ln 2)^{n+1}((\ln 2)^n-1)}{4(\ln 2-1)} - \cdots
&lt;/math&gt;
which, taking just the first three terms, is correct to the first decimal place when ''n'' is positive&amp;mdash;cf. [[Tetration]]: {{math|''f'' &lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;(1) {{=}} &lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;{{sqrt|2}} }}. (Using the other fixed point {{math|''a'' {{=}} ''f''(4) {{=}} 4}} causes the series to diverge.)

For {{math| ''n'' {{=}} −1}}, the series computes the inverse function,  {{math| 2 ln''x''/ln 2}}.

===Example 3===
With the function   {{math|''f''(''x'') {{=}} ''x''&lt;sup&gt;''b''&lt;/sup&gt;}}, expand around the fixed point 1 to get the series
: &lt;math&gt;
f^n(x) = 1 + b^n(x-1) + \frac{1}2b^{n}(b^n-1)(x-1)^2 + \frac{1}{3!}b^n (b^n-1)(b^n-2)(x-1)^3 + \cdots  ~,
&lt;/math&gt;
which is simply the Taylor series of ''x''&lt;sup&gt;(''b''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; )&lt;/sup&gt; expanded around 1.

==Conjugacy==

If {{mvar|f}} and {{mvar|g}} are two iterated functions, and there exists a [[homeomorphism]] {{mvar|h}} such that  {{math| ''g'' {{=}}  ''h''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; ○ ''f'' ○ ''h'' }},  then {{mvar|f}} and {{mvar|g}} are said to be [[Topological conjugacy|topologically conjugate]].

Clearly, topological conjugacy is preserved under iteration, as {{math|''g''&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;{{=}}''h''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;  ○  ''f'' &lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt; ○ ''h''}}.  Thus, if one can solve for one iterated function system, one also  has solutions for all topologically conjugate systems. For example, the [[tent map]] is topologically conjugate to the [[logistic map]]. As a special case, taking {{math|''f''(''x'') {{=}} ''x''+1}}, one has the iteration of {{math|''g''(''x'') {{=}} ''h''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;(''h''(''x'')+1)}} as 
:{{math|''g''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;(''x'') {{=}} ''h''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;(''h''(''x'') + ''n'')}},  &amp;nbsp;  for any function {{mvar|h}}.

Making the substitution {{math|''x'' {{=}} ''h''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;(''y'') {{=}} ''ϕ''(''y'')}} yields 
:{{math|''g''(''ϕ''(''y'')) {{=}} ''ϕ''(''y''+1)}},  &amp;nbsp; a form known as the [[Abel equation]].

Even in the absence of a strict homeomorphism, near a fixed point, here taken to be at {{mvar|x}} = 0, {{mvar|f}}(0) = 0, one may often solve&lt;ref&gt;Kimura, Tosihusa  (1971). "On the Iteration of Analytic Functions",  [http://www.math.sci.kobe-u.ac.jp/~fe/ ''Funkcialaj Ekvacioj''] '''14''', 197-238.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Schröder's equation]] for a function  {{mvar|Ψ}}, which makes {{math|''f''(''x'')}} locally conjugate to a mere dilation, {{math|''g''(''x'') {{=}} ''f'' '(0) ''x''}}, that is  
:{{math|''f''(''x'') {{=}}  ''Ψ''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;(''f'' '(0)  ''Ψ''(''x''))}}.

Thus, its iteration orbit, or flow, under suitable provisions (e.g., {{math|''f'' '(0) ≠ 1}}), amounts to the conjugate of the orbit of the monomial, 
:{{math|''Ψ''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;(''f'' '(0)&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; ''Ψ''(''x''))}},  
where {{mvar|n}} in this expression serves as a plain exponent: ''functional iteration has been reduced to multiplication!''  Here, however, the exponent {{mvar|n}} no longer needs be integer or positive, and is a continuous "time" of evolution for the full orbit:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Curtright |first=T.L. |authorlink=Thomas Curtright|author2=Zachos, C.K. |authorlink2=Cosmas Zachos | year=2009|title=Evolution Profiles and Functional Equations |journal=Journal of Physics A |volume=42|issue=48 |pages=485208|doi=10.1088/1751-8113/42/48/485208|arxiv=0909.2424|bibcode=2009JPhA...42V5208C}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[monoid]] of the Picard sequence (cf. [[transformation semigroup]]) has generalized to a full [[continuous group]].&lt;ref&gt;For explicit instance, example 2 above amounts to just {{math|''f'' &lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;(''x'') {{=}} ''Ψ''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;((ln2)&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt; ''Ψ''(''x''))}}, for ''any n'', not necessarily integer, where {{mvar|''Ψ''}} is the solution of the relevant [[Schröder's equation]], {{math|''Ψ''({{sqrt|2}}&lt;sup&gt;''x''&lt;/sup&gt;){{=}} ln2 ''Ψ''(''x'')}}. This solution is also the infinite ''m'' limit of {{math|(''f'' &lt;sup&gt;m&lt;/sup&gt;(''x'') −2)/(ln2)&lt;sup&gt;m&lt;/sup&gt;}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The functions below the (&lt;span style="color:blue"&gt;blue&lt;/span&gt;)  sine are six integral iterates below it, starting with the second iterate (&lt;span style="color:red"&gt;red&lt;/span&gt;) and ending with the 64th iterate.

]]

This method (perturbative determination of the principal [[eigenfunction]] {{mvar|Ψ}}, cf. [[Carleman matrix]]) is equivalent to the algorithm of the preceding section, albeit, in practice,  more powerful and systematic.

==Markov chains==
If the function is linear and can be described by a [[stochastic matrix]], that is, a matrix whose rows or columns sum to one, then the iterated system is known as a [[Markov chain]].

==Examples==
There are [[List of chaotic maps|many chaotic maps]]. 
Well-known iterated functions include the [[Mandelbrot set]] and [[iterated function systems]].

[[Ernst Schröder]],&lt;ref name="schr"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Schröder |first=Ernst |authorlink=Ernst Schröder |year=1870 |title=Ueber iterirte Functionen|journal=Math. Ann. |volume=3 |issue= 2|pages=296&amp;ndash;322 | doi=10.1007/BF01443992 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1870, worked out special cases of the [[logistic map]], such as the chaotic case {{math|''f''(''x'') {{=}} 4''x''(1−''x'')}}, so that {{math|''Ψ''(''x'') {{=}} arcsin&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;({{radic|''x''}})}}, hence {{math|''f'' &lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;(''x'') {{=}} sin&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;(2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;  arcsin({{radic|''x''}}))}}.

A nonchaotic case  Schröder also illustrated with his method,  {{math|''f''(''x'') {{=}} 2''x''(1 − ''x'')}}, yielded  {{math|''Ψ''(''x'') {{=}} −{{sfrac|1|2}} ln(1−2''x'')}}, and hence  {{math|''f'' &lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;(''x'') {{=}} −{{sfrac|1|2}}((1−2''x'')&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;−1)}}.

If {{mvar|''f''}} is the [[group action|action]] of a group element on a set, then the iterated function corresponds to a [[free group]].

Most functions do not have explicit general [[closed-form expression]]s for the ''n''-th iterate. The table below lists some&lt;ref name="schr"/&gt; that do. Note that all these expressions are valid even for non-integer and negative ''n'', as well as positive integer ''n''.

==Means of study==
Iterated functions can be studied with the [[Artin–Mazur zeta function]] and with [[transfer operator]]s.

==In computer science==
In [[computer science]], iterated functions occur as a special case of [[recursion (computer science)|recursive functions]], which in turn anchor the study of such broad topics as [[lambda calculus]], or narrower ones, such as the [[denotational semantics]] of computer programs.

==Definitions in terms of iterated functions==
Two important [[functional (mathematics)|functionals]] can be defined in terms of iterated functions. These are [[summation]]:

:&lt;math&gt;
\left\{b+1,\sum_{i=a}^b g(i)\right\} \equiv \left( \{i,x\} \rightarrow \{ i+1 ,x+g(i) \}\right)^{b-a+1} \{a,0\}
&lt;/math&gt;

and the equivalent product:

:&lt;math&gt;
\left\{b+1,\prod_{i=a}^b g(i)\right\} \equiv \left( \{i,x\} \rightarrow \{ i+1 ,x g(i) \}\right)^{b-a+1} \{a,1\}
&lt;/math&gt;

==Functional derivative==
The [[functional derivative]] of an iterated function is given by the recursive formula:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{ \delta f^N(x)}{\delta f(y)} = f'( f^{N-1}(x) ) \frac{ \delta f^{N-1}(x)}{\delta f(y)} + \delta( f^{N-1}(x) - y ) &lt;/math&gt;

==Lie's data transport equation==
Iterated functions crop up in the series expansion of combined functions, such as  {{math|''g''(''f''(''x''))}}.

Given the [[Koenigs function#Structure of univalent semigroups|iteration velocity]], or [[beta function (physics)]],  
:&lt;math&gt;v(x)=\partial f^n(x)  / \partial n |_{n=0}&lt;/math&gt; 
for the {{mvar|n}}&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; iterate of the function {{mvar|f}}, we have&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Berkson | first1 = E. | last2 = Porta | first2 = H. | doi = 10.1307/mmj/1029002009 | title = Semigroups of analytic functions and composition operators | journal = The Michigan Mathematical Journal | volume = 25 | pages = 101 | year = 1978 | pmid =  | pmc = }}  {{Cite journal | last1 = Curtright | first1 = T.

:&lt;math&gt;
g(f(x)) = \exp\left[ v(x) \dfrac{\partial}{\partial x} \right] g(x).
&lt;/math&gt;
For example, for rigid advection, if {{math|''f''(''x'') {{=}} ''x'' + ''t''}}, then {{math|''v''(''x'') {{=}} ''t''}}.  Consequently,  {{math|''g''(''x'' + ''t'') {{=}} exp(''t'' ∂/∂''x'')  ''g''(''x'')}}, action by a plain [[shift operator]].

Conversely, one may   specify {{math|''f''(''x'')}}  given an arbitrary {{math|''v''(''x'')}}, through the generic [[Abel equation]]  discussed above,
:&lt;math&gt;
f(x) = h^{-1}(h(x)+1) ,
&lt;/math&gt;
where
:&lt;math&gt;
h(x) = \int{\frac{1}{v(x)}dx} .
&lt;/math&gt;
This is evident by noting that 
:&lt;math&gt;f^n(x)=h^{-1}(h(x)+n)~.&lt;/math&gt;

For continuous iteration index {{mvar|t}}, then, now written as a subscript, this amounts to Lie's celebrated exponential realization of a continuous group,
:&lt;math&gt;e^{t~\frac{\partial ~~}{\partial h(x)}} g(x)= g(h^{-1}(h(x )+t))= g(f_t(x)).&lt;/math&gt;
The initial flow velocity {{mvar|v}} suffices to determine the entire flow, given this exponential realization which automatically provides the  general solution to the ''translation functional equation'',&lt;ref  name="acz"&gt;Aczel, J (2006), ''Lectures on Functional 
Equations and Their Applications'' (Dover Books on Mathematics, 2006), Ch. 6, {{ISBN|978-0486445236}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  
:&lt;math&gt;f_t(f_\tau (x))=f_{t+\tau} (x)  ~.&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1885">'''Judicial reform''' is the complete or partial political [[reform]] of a country's [[judiciary]]. Judicial reform is often done as a part of wider reform of the country's political system or a legal reform.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Barenboim, Natalya Merkulova. "[http://philosophicalclub.ru/content/docs/worldruleoflaw.pdf The 25th Anniversary of Constitutional Economics: The Russian Model and Legal Reform in Russia, in The World Rule of Law Movement and Russian Legal Reform]", edited by Francis Neate and Holly Nielsen, Justitsinform, Moscow (2007).&lt;/ref&gt;

Areas of the judicial reform often include; codification of law instead of [[common law]], moving from an [[inquisitorial system]] to an [[adversarial system]], establishing stronger judicial independence with [[judicial council]]s or changes to appointment procedure, establishing mandatory retirement age for judges or  enhancing independence of [[prosecution]].

A '''wet dress rehearsal''' ('''WDR'''), and a more extensive '''static fire''', are [[system testing|system tests]] of a fully integrated space [[launch vehicle]] and its associated [[ground support equipment]] (GSE) prior to &lt;!-- "spacecraft integration and" -- wdr may or may not be done with the spacecraft/payload already integrated to the launch vehicle; they have been, and still continue to be, done both ways.  No source here showing it to be only the one way. --&gt;launch. The spacecraft or payload may or may not be attached to the launch vehicle during the WDR or static fire, but sufficient elements of the rocket and all relevant ground support equipment are in place to help [[Verification and validation|verify]] that the rocket is ready for flight, with the goal of allowing problems to be seen prior to the actual launch.

==Wet dress rehearsal ==
A wet dress rehearsal is called "wet" because the liquid [[rocket propellant|propellant]] components (such as [[liquid oxygen]], [[liquid hydrogen]], etc.) are loaded into the rocket during the test. In a pure wet dress rehearsal the rocket engines are not ignited.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=GPS IIF-2 Wet Dress Rehearsal – SpacePod 2011.06.09|url=http://www.spacevidcast.com/2011/06/09/gps-iif-2-wet-dress-rehearsal-spacepod-2011-06-09/|accessdate=6 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Static fire ==
A '''static fire''' test includes a wet dress rehearsal and goes one step farther: actually firing the engines at full thrust.  The engine (or engines) is fired for a few seconds while the [[launch vehicle]], with or without payload attached, is held firmly attached to the [[launch mount]]. This tests engine startup while measuring pressure, temperature and propellant-flow gradients.  The data gathered in such tests may be used to form a unique (rocket- and engine-specific) set of criteria as part of the go/nogo decision tree in the automated launch software that is used on the actual launch day, typically a few days later.  Some static fire tests have fired the engines for up to twelve seconds,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2018/01/spacex-static-fire-falcon-heavy-1/ |title=Falcon Heavy comes to life as SpaceX conduct Static Fire test |author=Chris Gebhardt |date=24 January 2018 |publisher=NASASpaceFlight.com |accessdate=25 January 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; although shorter firings are more typical.&lt;ref name=nsf20160112&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2016/01/spacex-preparing-west-coast-jason-3-launch-with-last-falcon-9-v1-1/ |title=SpaceX Falcon 9 v1.1 conducts static fire test ahead of Jason-3 mission |author=Chris Gebhardt |date=12 January 2016&lt;!-- article date still shows as 8 Jan, but article was updated in early am UTC on 12 Jan following successful evening local California time static fire test --&gt; |publisher=NASASpaceFlight.com |accessdate=12 January 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2017/03/ses-10-static-fire-spacex-first-core-re-flight/|title=SES-10 F9 static fire – SpaceX for history books &amp; first core stage re-flight – NASASpaceFlight.com|website=www.nasaspaceflight.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Use ==
Many [[launch service provider]]s do not regularly perform wet dress rehearsals on new launch vehicles; {{asof|2018|lc=y}} some regularly perform wet dress rehearsals or even full [[#static fire|static fire system tests]] on the [[launch mount]].  For example, [[SpaceX]] typically performs a full static fire on every new booster and also on each [[SpaceX reusable rocket|reflown booster]] before every launch, sometimes more than once.  In January 2018, SpaceX did two wet dress rehearsals on the [[Zuma (satellite)|Zuma]] [[Falcon 9]] mission, and aimed for, and conducted, multiple wet dress rehearsals on the new [[Falcon Heavy]] launch vehicle design which had its [[maiden flight|maiden launch]] on February 6, 2018.  Both were explicitly booked as wet dress rehearsals, but with the option to proceed to a static fire test.  In the event, the second wet dress rehearsal on 24 January 2018 did lead to a full 12-second static fire test of the 27 engines of the Falcon Heavy—a much longer static fire test than the usual 3–7 second duration tests SpaceX uses for the Falcon 9.&lt;ref name=nsf20180109&gt;

Wet rehearsal and static fire tests can fail catastrophically, as with a pad explosion of a SpaceX Falcon 9 on 1 September 2016,&lt;ref name=lat20160909&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19994">In [[physics]] and [[applied mathematics]], the mass [[moment of inertia]], usually denoted by {{mvar|I}}, measures the extent to which an object resists rotational acceleration about a particular axis, and is the rotational analogue to mass. Mass moments of inertia have [[physical unit|units]] of [[dimensional analysis|dimension]] ML&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;([mass] × [length]&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;). It should not be confused with the [[second moment of area]], which is used in beam calculations. The mass moment of inertia is often also known as the rotational inertia, and sometimes as the angular mass.

For simple objects with geometric symmetry, one can often determine the moment of inertia in an exact [[closed-form expression]]. Typically this occurs when the [[mass density]] is constant, but in some cases the density can vary throughout the object as well. In general, it may not be straightforward to symbolically express the moment of inertia of shapes with more complicated mass distributions and lacking symmetry. When calculating moments of inertia, it is useful to remember that it is an additive function and exploit the [[parallel axis theorem|parallel axis]] and [[perpendicular axis theorem]]s.

This article mainly considers symmetric mass distributions, with constant density throughout the object, and the axis of rotation is taken to be through the [[center of mass]] unless otherwise specified.

==Moments of inertia==

Following are scalar moments of inertia. In general, the moment of inertia is a tensor, see below.

{|class="wikitable"
|-
! Description || Figure || Moment(s) of inertia
|-
| Point mass ''M'' at a distance ''r'' from the axis of rotation.

A point mass does not have a moment of inertia around its own axis, but using the [[parallel axis theorem]] a moment of inertia around a distant axis of rotation is achieved.

|align="center"|[[File:PointInertia.svg|frameless|upright]]
| &lt;math&gt; I = M r^2&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| Two point masses, ''m''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''m''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, with [[reduced mass]] ''μ'' and separated by a distance ''x'', about an axis passing through the center of mass of the system and perpendicular to the line joining the two particles.
|align="center"|[[File:MOIaboutCOMaxis2.svg|frameless|upright]]
|&lt;math&gt; I = \frac{ m_1 m_2 }{ m_1 \! + \! m_2 } x^2 = \mu x^2&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| [[Rod (geometry)|Rod]] of length ''L'' and mass ''m'', rotating about its center.

This expression assumes that the rod is an infinitely thin (but rigid) wire. This is a special case of the thin rectangular plate with axis of rotation at the center of the plate, with ''w'' = ''L'' and ''h'' = 0.

| align="center"|[[File:moment of inertia rod center.svg|frameless|upright]]
| &lt;math&gt;I_\mathrm{center} = \frac{1}{12} m L^2 \,\!&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;ref name="serway"/&gt;
|-
| [[Rod (geometry)|Rod]] of length ''L'' and mass ''m'', rotating about one end.

This expression assumes that the rod is an infinitely thin (but rigid) wire. This is also a special case of the thin rectangular plate with axis of rotation at the end of the plate, with ''h'' = ''L'' and ''w'' = 0.

| align="center"|[[File:moment of inertia rod end.svg|frameless|upright]]
| &lt;math&gt;I_\mathrm{end} = \frac{1}{3} m L^2 \,\!&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;ref name="serway"/&gt;
|-
| Thin circular loop of radius ''r'' and mass ''m''.

This is a special case of a [[torus]] for ''a'' = 0 (see below), as well as of a thick-walled cylindrical tube with open ends, with ''r''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = ''r''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and ''h'' = 0.

| align="center"|[[File:moment of inertia hoop.svg|170px]]
| &lt;math&gt;I_z = m r^2\!&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;math&gt;I_x = I_y = \frac{1}{2} m r^2 \,\!&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| Thin, solid [[disk (mathematics)|disk]] of radius ''r'' and mass ''m''.

This is a special case of the solid cylinder, with ''h'' = 0. That &lt;math&gt;I_x = I_y = \frac{I_z}{2}\,&lt;/math&gt; is a consequence of the [[perpendicular axis theorem]].

|align="center"| [[File:moment of inertia disc.svg|170px]]
| &lt;math&gt;I_z = \frac{1}{2}m r^2\,\!&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;math&gt;I_x = I_y = \frac{1}{4} m r^2\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| Thin [[cylinder (geometry)|cylindrical]] shell with open ends, of radius ''r'' and mass ''m''.

This expression assumes that the shell thickness is negligible. It is a special case of the thick-walled cylindrical tube for ''r''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = ''r''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.
Also, a point mass ''m'' at the end of a rod of length ''r'' has this same moment of inertia and the value ''r'' is called the [[radius of gyration]].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- There is no such thing as an illegal set of axes. They may be invalid for some purposes but the x, y and z may just be labels. The right-hand rule has no bearing here.
the x-y-z axis for the solid cylinder does not follow the right-hand rule and is an illegal set of axis. --&gt;
&lt;!--'force at centre of mass always subjects to transational motion. but force at axis ofrotation is not 100% giving rise to transational motion.' - Gibberish! Hopefully, someone can translate this into something meaningful (and get spelling correct).--&gt;

== List of 3D inertia tensors ==

This list of [[Moment of inertia#The inertia tensor|moment of inertia tensor]]s is given for [[Principal axis theorem|principal axes]] of each object.

To obtain the scalar moments of inertia '''I''' above, the tensor moment of inertia '''I''' is projected along some axis defined by a [[unit vector]] '''n''' according to the formula:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{n}\cdot\mathbf{I}\cdot\mathbf{n}\equiv n_i I_{ij} n_j\,,&lt;/math&gt;

where the dots indicate [[tensor contraction]] and the [[Einstein summation convention]] is used. In the above table, '''n''' would be the unit [[Cartesian coordinate system#Representing a vector in the standard basis|Cartesian basis]] '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;, '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;''y''&lt;/sub&gt;, '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;''z''&lt;/sub&gt; to obtain ''I&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''I&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''I&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;'' respectively.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="25069">This [[list of rampage killers]] lists mass murders where the perpetrator used only [[hand grenade]]s or comparable explosive devices, like [[pipe bomb]]s or [[dynamite]] sticks, for the attack. As it is sometimes difficult to distinguish cases of grenade attacks from acts of terrorism or gang-related attacks, incidents are only included where there is at least some indication that it was neither committed in the context of a political, ethnic, or religious conflict, nor part of an assault with more than one participating offender.

A rampage killer has been defined as follows:
{{quote|A rampage involves the (attempted) killing of multiple persons least partly in public space by a single physically present perpetrator using (potentially) deadly weapons in a single event without any cooling-off period.&lt;ref&gt;Seeger, Thorsten (ed.) School Shootings: International Research, Case Studies, and Concepts for Prevention; Springer, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
This list should contain every case with at least one of the following features:
* Rampage killings with 6 or more dead 
* Rampage killings with at least 4 people killed and least ten victims overall (dead plus injured)
* Rampage killings with at least 2 people killed and least 12 victims overall (dead plus injured)
* An incidence of rampage killing shall not be included in this list if it does not include at least two people killed.
* In all cases the perpetrator is not counted among those killed or injured.

==The Model==
[[File:Magpie illustration.jpg|thumb|Input data and output parameters of MAgPIE]]
The model is based on static yield functions in order to model potential crop productivity and its related water use.&lt;ref name=Lotze-Campen2008 /&gt; For the biophysical supply simulation, spatially explicit 0.5° data is aggregated to a consistent number of clusters. Ten world regions represent the demand side of the model. Required calories for the demand categories (food and non-food energy intake) are determined by a cross-sectional country regression based on population and income projections. In order to fulfill the demand, the model allocates 19 cropping and 5 [[livestock]] activities to the spatially-explicit land and water resources, subject to resource, management and cost constraints. From 1995 MAgPIE simulates time-steps of 10 years. For each period the optimal land use pattern from the previous period is used as a starting point.&lt;ref name=Schmitz2012 /&gt; 

==Demand==
The demand for agricultural products is fixed for every region and every time-step. The drivers of agricultural demand are: time, income and population growth. Total demand is composed of: food demand, material demand, feed demand and seed demand. Food demand depends on food energy demand, and the share of crop and livestock products in the diet. Within livestock products, the share of different products (Ruminant meat, chicken meat, other meat, milk, eggs) is fixed at 1995 levels. The same is valid for the share of crops within total food calories and material demand. The share of livestock products in the total consumed food calories is an important driver for the land-use sector. Different statistical models are used to estimate plausible future scenarios. A calibration is used to reach the livestock shares of the Food Balance Sheets for 1995 for each region.

Feed for livestock is produced as a mixture of concentrates, fodder, livestock products (e.g. bone meal), pasture, crop residues and conversion by-products (e.g. rapeseed cake) at predefined proportions. These differences in the livestock systems cause different emission levels from livestock.

==Biophysical Inputs==
The biophysical inputs for the simulations are obtained from the grid-based model [[LPJmL]]. The global vegetation model with managed land (LPJmL) also delivers values for water availability and requirements for each grid cell as well as the carbon content of the different vegetation types. Cropland, pasture, and irrigation water are fixed inputs in limited supply in each grid cell.&lt;ref name=Schmitz2012 /&gt;

==Cost Types==
MAgPIE takes four different cost types into account: production costs for crop and livestock production, investments in technological change, land conversion costs and intra-regional transport costs. By minimizing these four cost components on a global scale for the current time step, the model solution is obtained. Production costs in MAgPIE imply costs for labor, capital and intermediate inputs. They are specific for all crop and livestock types and are implemented as costs per area for crops (US$/ha) and costs per production unit of livestock (US$/ton). 

MAgPIE has two options to increase total production in agriculture at additional costs: land expansion and intensification. In MAgPIE the latter can be achieved by investments in technological change (TC).&lt;ref name=Schmitz2012 /&gt; Investing in technological change triggers yield increases which lead then to a higher total production. At the same time the corresponding increases in agricultural land-use intensity raises costs for further yield increases. The reason is that intensification on land which is already used intensively is more expensive than intensification on extensively-used land.

To increase production another alternative is to expand cropland into non-agricultural land.&lt;ref name=Krause2009&gt;{{cite journal|last=Krause|first=M.|author2=Lotze-Campen, H. |author3=Popp, A. |title=Spatially-explicit scenarios on global cropland expansion and available forest land in an integrated modelling framework|journal=Conference Paper|date=August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The conversion causes additional costs for the preparation of new land and basic infrastructure investments, which are also taken into account. Intraregional transport costs arise for each commodity unit as a function of the distance to intraregional markets and therefore restrict land expansion in MAgPIE. This depends on the quality and accessibility of infrastructure. Intra-regional transport costs are higher for less accessible areas than for more accessible regions. This leads to higher overall costs of cropland expansion in those cases.&lt;ref name=Schmitz2012 /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1059">The '''measure''' in [[quantum physics]] is the integration [[measure (mathematics)|measure]] used for performing a [[line integral|path integral]].

In [[quantum field theory]], one must sum over all possible histories of a system. 
When summing over possible histories, which may be very similar to each other, one has to decide when two histories are to be considered different, and when they are to be considered the same, in order not to count the same history twice. This decision is coded within the concept of the '''measure''' by an '''[[Observer (quantum physics)|observer]]'''.

In fact, the possible histories can be deformed continuously, and therefore the sum is in fact an [[integral]], known as [[path integral formulation|path integral]].&lt;br&gt;
In the limit where the sum is becoming an integral, the concept of the measure described above is replaced by an integration [[measure (mathematics)|measure]].

'''Micro-donation''' or '''microphilanthropy''' is a form of [[Charity (practice)|charitable donation]] that is small in the donated amount. In the past{{when|date=January 2015}}, micro-donations have been used most effectively by companies collecting spare change at registers and checkouts. Recently{{when|date=January 2015}}, this form of [[philanthropy]] has become more popular with the advent of online and [[mobile donating]].
  
In addition to the more traditional forms of donating, like giving directly from person to person, both the internet and mobile-phones have become more accepted by the public for collecting donations.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

Micro-donations of $200 or less have made up an ever-larger share of nomination fundraising in the three [[United States presidential primary]] elections since 2000. (In this measurement a person who donates $190 twice to a candidate has given two micro-donations, but is not a micro-donor). Micro-donations accounted for 25% of the total donations for the [[United States presidential election, 2000|United States presidential election in 2000]]. This figure rose to 34% in 2004 and 38.8% in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;Malbin, Michael J. (2006). “A Public Funding System in Jeopardy: Lessons from the Presidential Nomination Contest of 2004.” In The Election After Reform: Money, Politics and the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act (Michael Malbin, ed.) 219&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=CFI Release|title=After Holding Financial Advantage in Primaries, Obama Likely to Achieve Only Parity with McCain in General Election|url=http://www.cfinst.org/press/PReleases/08-09-25/After_Holding_Financial_Advantage_in_Primaries_Obama_Likely_to_Achieve_Only_Parity_with_McCain_in_General_Election.aspx|date=September 26, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hasen, Richard L.: ''More Supply, More Demand: The Changing Nature of Campaign Financing for Presidential Primary Candidates'', (December 1, 2008). Loyola-LA Legal Studies Paper No. 2008-26.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Supporting technology==
Microphilanthropy requires the ability to deal with a large number of small interactions efficiently. If a successful approach also includes implementing a fundraising drive that utilizes microphilanthropic resources connected to a specific charity, the approach must also include a structure or "middleman" technology that allows for an effective, efficient aggregation and distribution of microphilanthropic donations.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} For example, the US-based nonprofit [[Zidisha]] offers an [[eBay]]-style peer-to-peer [[microlending]] platform, which uses internet and mobile phone technology to deliver services between lenders and borrowers directly across international borders without local intermediaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.zidisha.org/editables/news_docs/AP_Aug2010.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140328160901/https://www.zidisha.org/editables/news_docs/AP_Aug2010.pdf|archivedate=28 March 2014|title=A Microloan "eBay" for African Entrepreneurs|work=Afrikan Post|date=August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Raised into a poor family in [[Kewanee, Illinois]], Cernovich studied through the [[University of Illinois system]] and then the [[Pepperdine University School of Law]].

==Early life and career==
Cernovich was born on November 17, 1977.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pscp.tv/w/1rmxPbeZLXZGN |title=AMA Birthday Periscope |last=Cernovich |first=Mike |date=November 18, 2016 |website=[[Periscope (app)|Periscope]] |location=San Clemente, California|access-date=November 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He grew up in a devout Christian family&lt;ref name="Marantz-31-10-16" /&gt; in the farming town of [[Kewanee, Illinois]]. The family was poor, and his mother suffered from [[Mental disorder|mental illness]] and spent time in an [[Psychiatric hospital|institution]].&lt;ref name="M" /&gt; He graduated from the [[University of Illinois system]] and later from the [[Pepperdine University School of Law]].&lt;ref name="M"&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Mimeis Law |date=February 24, 2016 |last=Greenfield |first=Scott |title=Cross: Mike Cernovich, The 800 lb.

In 2004, Cernovich started a legal weblog entitled Crime &amp; Federalism, and his blog was selected for syndication by [[ALM (company)|American Lawyer Media]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Cernovich |first1=Michael |title=Reflections on 2004 |url=http://www.crimeandfederalism.com/2005/01/relections_on_2.html |website=Crime &amp; Federalism |accessdate=July 7, 2017 |date=January 1, 2005 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161206031041/http://www.crimeandfederalism.com/2005/01/relections_on_2.html |archivedate=December 6, 2016 |df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Blawg Directory: Crime &amp; Federalism |url=http://www.abajournal.com/blawg/crime-federalism |website=ABA Journal |publisher=American Bar Association |accessdate=July 7, 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160912073535/http://www.abajournal.com/blawg/crime-federalism |archivedate=September 12, 2016 |df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Keeping Current: Staying Abreast of Legal Topics Plus a Sneak Peek at Emerging Technologies |url=http://digitalcommons.law.uga.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1011&amp;context=speeches |website=Digital Commons @ Georgia Law |publisher=University of Georgia Law School |accessdate=July 8, 2017 |date=May 13, 2005 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160527184925/http://digitalcommons.law.uga.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1011&amp;context=speeches |archivedate=May 27, 2016 |df=mdy-all}}  (Listing Crime &amp; Federalism among ALM's Legal Blog Watch on Law.com.)&lt;/ref&gt;

In his early writings Cernovich focused on [[antifeminism]], men's empowerment, and how to meet women.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&amp;nbsp;The title of Danger and Play came from a quote by [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], "The true man wants two things: danger and play. For that reason he wants woman, as the most dangerous plaything." In 2014, Cernovich promoted [[Gamergate controversy|Gamergate]], a controversy during which several women in the [[video game industry]] were targeted by Internet trolls, goading opponents with tweets such as "Who cares about breast cancer and rape? Not me."&lt;ref name="Marantz-31-10-16" /&gt;

In 2015, Cernovich wrote a [[self-published]] self-help book, ''Gorilla Mindset''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nationalreview.com/sites/default/files/nrdpdf/20170710.pdf#page=24 |title=Info |website=www.nationalreview.com |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, he tweeted, "Women love aggressive men, but only if they are alpha males."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; According to ''The New York Times'' in April 2017, Cernovich has long been criticized for arguing that date rape is a "harmful concept for men and women."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; He saw [[Donald Trump]] as a kindred spirit and began to engage in political commentary.&lt;ref name="Marantz-31-10-16" /&gt;

== Media ==
Cernovich had previously – in early 2006 – published an article deriding Trump on Crime &amp; Federalism. The piece referred to the billionaire as a "media whore" who "casts his image to the world on demand and recasts it constantly to suit everchanging ratings and marketing schemes," and advised to "never trust a man who combs his hair so as to cover his shiny dome, and then flaunts a wife young enough to be his daughter."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.crimeandfederalism.com/2006/01/donald_chump.html |title=Donald Chump? |first=Michael |last=Cernovich |website=''Crime &amp; Federalism''|accessdate=May 26, 2018 |language=en |date=January 29, 2006 |archive-url=https://archive.fo/rZAY2 |archive-date=2017-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cernovich became influential on [[social media]], initially as part of the [[manosphere]] movement,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Kutner |first1=Max |title=Roosh V's journey from pickup artist to right-wing provocateur |url=http://www.newsweek.com/2016/10/21/roosh-v-pickup-artist-right-wing-provocateur-509319.html |accessdate=October 11, 2017 |work=Newsweek |date=October 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and more recently has helped to shape [[Far-right politics|far-right]] narratives in the United States.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; He falsely claimed during the [[United States presidential election, 2016|2016 United States presidential election]] that [[Hillary Clinton]] had a "seizure disorder" and [[Parkinson's disease]]. By September his #HillarysHealth [[hashtag]] had gotten 240,000 page views and had become a national [[trending topic]] on [[Twitter]]. During the month of September, Cernovich's tweets were seen more than 100 million times.&lt;ref name="Marantz-31-10-16" /&gt;

Cernovich frequently calls his adversaries "cucks", a variant of the alt-right slang word [[cuckservative]], a pejorative term for conservatives who supposedly betray conservative social values. In reference to this he has written, "To beat a person, you lower his or her social status. [[Logic]] is pointless."&lt;ref name="Marantz-31-10-16" /&gt; Cernovich admits to sometimes using [[Internet troll|trolling tactics]], which he says he uses to build his brand rather than for his own amusement.&lt;ref name="Marantz-31-10-16" /&gt;

Cernovich helped popularize the false [[Pizzagate conspiracy theory]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Dissecting the #PizzaGate Conspiracy Theories |url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/12/10/business/media/pizzagate.html |work=The New York Times |date=December 10, 2016 |last=Huang |first=Gregor Aisch, Jon|access-date=April 6, 2017 |last2=Kang |first2=Cecilia |issn=0362-4331 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161210112745/http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/12/10/business/media/pizzagate.html |archivedate=December 10, 2016 |df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; through his blog posts and believes that child sex rings run rampant in [[Washington, D.C.]] He has accused his opponents of being [[Pedophilia|pedophiles]] on multiple occasions,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nymag.com/selectall/2016/12/how-mike-cernovich-is-pizzagating-his-latest-victim.html |title=How Mike Cernovich Is Pizzagating His Latest Victim |first=Jesse |last=Singal |publisher= |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161222042112/http://nymag.com/selectall/2016/12/how-mike-cernovich-is-pizzagating-his-latest-victim.html |archivedate=December 22, 2016 |df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in a [[YouTube]] video maintained that most people employed by the news media and "every [[A-list]] actor" in [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]] were also pedophiles.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In October 2016 Cernovich said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"The left likes to talk about power structures, right? Well, the media still thinks of itself as speaking truth to power. What they don't realize is that someone like me is perceived as the new [[Fourth Estate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/07/business/media/medias-next-challenge-overcoming-the-threat-of-fake-news.html |title=Media's Next Challenge: Overcoming the Threat of Fake News |last1=Rutenberg |first1=Jim |date=November 6, 2016 |work=[[The New York Times]] |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170302211127/https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/07/business/media/medias-next-challenge-overcoming-the-threat-of-fake-news.html |archivedate=March 2, 2017 |df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Maybe they should check their structural privilege." The "paternalistic" media, he said, was giving way to a more democratic one. "It makes journalists crazy, because they used to be in control. They can't control people anymore. Everyone has a voice now."&lt;ref name="Marantz-31-10-16" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Following an August 2016 appearance on [[Fox News]]'s ''[[Red Eye (talk show)|Red Eye]]'', the show's producers felt compelled afterwards to say that they had made a mistake in booking him when later learning of Cernovich's history of online disputes.&lt;ref name="The Daily Beast"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/08/09/why-did-fox-news-welcome-date-rape-apologist-mike-cernovich.html |title=Why Did Fox News Welcome Date Rape Apologist Mike Cernovich? |date=August 9, 2016 |work=[[The Daily Beast]] |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161013173006/http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/08/09/why-did-fox-news-welcome-date-rape-apologist-mike-cernovich.html |archivedate=October 13, 2016 |df=mdy-all |authorlink=Lloyd Grove |last=Grove |first=Lloyd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2017, the [[Anti-Defamation League]] accused Cernovich of commissioning and publishing a "blatantly anti-Semitic cartoon" by [[Ben Garrison]] as part of a campaign against President Donald Trump's national security adviser.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.adl.org/blog/anti-semitism-used-in-attack-against-national-security-adviser-h-r-mcmaster |title=Anti-Semitism Used in Attack Against National Security Adviser H.

In November 2017, Cernovich spread misinformation linking the [[Sutherland Springs church shooting]] to [[Antifa (United States)|Antifa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/talalansari/fake-news-about-the-texas-church-shooting |title=Here Is The Misinformation Going Around About The Texas Church Shooting |work=BuzzFeed|access-date=November 6, 2017 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===On sexual harassment===
In August 2012 Cernovich wrote that [[date rape]] "does not exist".&lt;ref name="The Daily Beast" /&gt; In October 2016 he wrote, "Lying about being in love to sleep with someone isn't rape. Getting played isn't rape. Regret isn't rape. Thinking, 'I might have been date raped,' means you weren't raped."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
In mid-November 2017, Cernovich offered $10,000 for information about congressional sexual harassment settlements. The next week, he sent documents concerning a case settled by [[John Conyers]] to [[BuzzFeed]], which vetted them and reported on them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/why-buzzfeed-teamed-with-a-far-right-figure-to-break-the-john-conyers-scandal/2017/11/21/64688b2a-ceca-11e7-9d3a-bcbe2af58c3a_story.html |title=Why BuzzFeed teamed with a far-right figure to break the John Conyers scandal |work=The Washington Post |last=Farhi |first=Paul |date=November 21, 2017 |accessdate=November 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cernovich encouraged all victims of sexual assault by congressmen to speak up and offered to cover their legal expenses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Basu |first=Ayushman |url=http://www.ibtimes.com/conspiracy-theorist-mike-cernovich-wants-sexual-assault-victims-congressmen-speak-2617798 |title=Conspiracy Theorist Mike Cernovich Wants Sexual Assault Victims Of Congressmen To Speak |work=International Business Times |date=November 22, 2017 |accessdate=November 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2017, Cernovich hosted an "Ask Me Anything" on [[Reddit]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/7liww8/im_mike_cernovich_journalist_author_and_filmmaker/drmka91/ |title=I'm Mike Cernovich - Journalist, Author, and Filmmaker. Ask Me Anything |website=''Reddit'' |accessdate=May 26, 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''AMA'', regarded as a failure by several media outlets, was dominated by users mocking him and asking questions about the rape allegations against him, his advice to men to nonconsensually expose their genitalia and masturbate in front of women who are unwilling to engage in sexual acts, and a supposed sexual encounter with a [[Kathoey|male-to-female transgender individual]] in [[Thailand]] (which Cernovich denied).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.thedailybeast.com/mike-cernovich-hounded-on-rape-allegation-in-reddit-ama |title=Mike Cernovich Hounded on Rape Allegation in Reddit AMA |first=Ben |last=Collins |publisher=''The Daily Beast'' |accessdate=May 26, 2018 |language=en |date=December 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "20171222nymag"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nymag.com/selectall/2017/12/mike-cernovichs-ama-went-about-as-well-as-youd-expect.html |title=Mike Cernovich's Reddit Ask Me Anything Is Going About As Well As You'd Expect |first=Jake |last=Swearingen |publisher=[[New York (magazine)|''New York'']] |accessdate=May 26, 2018 |language=en |date=December 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A few days later, he announced his intention to retire from social media, but reversed the decision within hours.&lt;ref name="Martin"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.metro.us/news/politics/mike-cernovich-alt-right |title=Who Is Mike Cernovich?  |first=Michael |last=Martin |publisher=''Metro.us'' |accessdate=May 26, 2018 |language=en |date=January 24, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2018, he publicized historical tweets in which director [[James Gunn]], a critic of Trump, had joked about rape and pedophilia; Gunn was fired by Disney as a result.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=O'Brien |first1=Luke |title=How Pizzagate Pusher Mike Cernovich Keeps Getting People Fired |url=https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/mike-cernovich-james-gunn-fired_us_5b5265cce4b0fd5c73c570ac |accessdate=July 22, 2018 |work=Huffington Post |date=July 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cernovich has made a number of tweets about rape, including comments that "date rape does not exist" and that "A whore will let her friend ruin your life with a false rape case.

===Relationship with Trump administration===
According to Politico website, during the 2016 campaign and early period of the Trump administration, Cernovich was an "indefatigable Trump cheerleader", hoping that he and kindred activists would have a major influence on the Republican Party. However, by 2018, he had become "increasingly critical" of Trump, and turning away from politics toward his “Gorilla Mindset” lifestyle-coaching practice. In September 2018, he tweeted, “There’s no Wall. She’s not locked up. But Flynn got fired and sent to wolves. And Sauadi [sic] Arabia sold weapons of murder.

| quote = I believe this tweet was posted when Polanski was seeking to return to the US. I wrote that tweet out of disgust with those who were excusing or were seeking to advocate forgiveness for Polanski's actions which caused him to flee the US. I was appalled that anyone would diminish the seriousness of rape, particularly of a child by citing the perpetrator's artistic contributions. Obviously, I would not wish any harm of my daughter or any other person. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I am confident that other tweets from that time will reflect my disgust in a less satirical tone.

Cernovich has been supportive of a [[universal basic income]] within the United States,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theweek.com/articles/689970/donald-trump-swamp-thing |title=Donald Trump, swamp thing |publisher=''[[The Week]]'' |date=April 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dailydot.com/layer8/far-right-face-internet-censorship/ |title=After Alex Jones, 4 far-right voices testing the limits of free speech online |publisher=''[[The Daily Dot]]'' |date=August 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; claiming that "[[Conservatism]] is on the way out" regarding national [[Social programs in the United States|social programmes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/01/the-new-right-and-the-alt-right-party-on-a-fractious-night/514001/ |last1=Gray|first1=Rosie|title=The 'New Right' and the 'Alt-Right' Party on a Fractious Night |publisher=''[[The Atlantic]]'' |date=January 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Interviewed on ''[[60 Minutes]]'' in March 2017, where he also advocated for [[single-payer healthcare]], he said if "a large swath of the company, or country, are suffering, then I think that we owe it to all Americans to do right by them and to help them out."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/4/4/15164598/alt-right-single-payer-health-care-trump |title=Why the alt-right loves single-payer health care |publisher=''[[Vox Media]]'' |date=April 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== White genocide ===
Cernovich believes in the [[white genocide conspiracy theory]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Peter Dutton’s offer to white South African farmers started on the far right  |url=https://nypost.com/2017/09/07/columbia-welcoming-alt-right-speakers-to-campus/ |publisher=''[[New York Post]]'' |date=September 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; saying that "white genocide is real" in relation to South Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=South African group under fire for lobbying US for white rights |url=https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/05/south-african-group-fire-lobbying-white-rights-180514054424008.html |publisher=[[Aljazeera.com]] |date=May 15, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has stated that he initially joined the [[alt-right]] after realizing that "tolerance only went one way and diversity is code for white genocide".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Lange |first1=Jeva |title=The president's son thinks PizzaGate conspiracy theorist Mike Cernovich should win the Pulitzer |url=http://theweek.com/speedreads/690167/presidents-son-thinks-pizzagate-conspiracy-theorist-mike-cernovich-should-win-pulitzer |accessdate=November 22, 2017 |work=The Week |date=April 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Kaczynski |first1=Andrew |title=Virginia gubernatorial candidate laughed about GOP 'cucks' on controversial conspiracy theorist's show |url=http://www.cnn.com/2017/03/24/politics/kfile-virginia-governor-livestream-appearance/index.html |accessdate=November 22, 2017 |work=CNN |date=March 24, 2017 |last2=McDermott |first2=Nathan}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Trump Jr. Wants 'Alt-right' Personality Mike Cernovich to Win Pulitzer |url=http://www.haaretz.com/us-news/1.781665 |work=Haaretz |date=April 5, 2017 |last=Haaretz|access-date=May 15, 2017 |language=en |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170514114210/http://www.haaretz.com/us-news/1.781665 |archivedate=May 14, 2017 |df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Virginia gubernatorial candidate laughed about GOP 'cucks' on controversial conspiracy theorist's show |url=https://edition.cnn.com/2017/03/24/politics/kfile-virginia-governor-livestream-appearance/index.html |publisher=[[CNN]] |date=December 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ohio treasurer and Senate candidate takes on Anti-Defamation League over far-right ‘witch hunt’ |url=https://www.yahoo.com/news/ohio-treasurer-senate-candidate-takes-anti-defamation-league-far-right-witch-hunt-202509465.html |publisher=[[Yahoo News]] |date=July 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=How Twitter’s Alt-Right Purge Fell Short |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/how-twitters-alt-right-purge-fell-short-196449/ |publisher=''[[Rolling Stone]]'' |date=December 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later deleted several tweets referring to the concept.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=James Gunn Was Fired For Old Tweets Because Disney Listened To The "Pizzagate" Guy |url=https://www.houstonpress.com/arts/should-james-gunn-have-been-fired-as-galaxy-director-10682469 |publisher=''[[Houston Press]]'' |date=July 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=This Is MSNBC’s De Facto Ombudsman |url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/cernovich-sam-seder-msnbc-twitter-rape_us_5a26bb8fe4b06d807b4f6557 |publisher=''[[HuffPost]]'' |date=December 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Personal life ==
Cernovich married his first wife as a law student in 2003. Cernovich has said the marriage was "ruined by feminist indoctrination". His wife became an attorney in [[Silicon Valley]] and earned millions of dollars from an initial public offering of stock. She filed for divorce in 2011, and Cernovich received what he has described as a "seven-figure sum" in the settlement. Cernovich met his second wife shortly thereafter, and lives outside of [[Los Angeles]], [[California]].&lt;ref name="Marantz-31-10-16" /&gt;

During an interview with his wife, when referring to his feelings about becoming a father to a baby girl, Cernovich said, "I’ll be nice to her, as long as she’s not a basic bitch."&lt;ref name="Marantz-31-10-16"/&gt;

Cernovich was charged with and arrested for rape in 2003, but he denied the allegations.&lt;ref name="The Daily Beast" /&gt; The charge related to this incident was later reduced to  misdemeanor [[Battery (crime)|battery]] of a woman, for which he performed community service.&lt;ref name="Marantz-31-10-16" /&gt;

[[File:Naive Cynicism Flow Chart.jpg|thumb|right|Flow chart of naïve cynicism]]

The term was formally proposed by [[Justin Kruger]] and [[Thomas Gilovich]] and has been studied across a wide range of contexts including: [[negotiation]]s,&lt;ref name ="Tsay 2011"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tsay|first1=Chia-Jung|last2=Shu|first2=Lisa L.|last3=Bazerman|first3=Max H.|title=Naïveté and Cynicism in Negotiations and Other Competitive Contexts|journal=The Academy of Management Annals|date=2011|volume=5|issue=1|pages=495–518|doi=10.1080/19416520.2011.587283}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ingroups and outgroups|group-membership]],&lt;ref name="Kruger 1999"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kruger|first1=Justin|last2=Gilovich|first2=Thomas|title='Naive cynicism' in everyday theories of responsibility assessment: On biased assumptions of bias.|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|date=1999|volume=76|issue=5|pages=743–753|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.76.5.743}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[marriage]],&lt;ref name="Kruger 1999" /&gt; [[economics]],&lt;ref name="Heath 2006"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Heath|first1=Joseph|title=Business ethics without stakeholders|journal=Business Ethics Quarterly|volume=16|issue=4|pages=533–557|url=http://benjaminferguson.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Heath-2006-Business-Ethics-Quarterly.pdf|doi=10.5840/beq200616448|date=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[public policy|government policy]]&lt;ref name="Benforado 2008"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Benforado|first1=Adam|last2=Hanson|first2=Jon|title=Naïve Cynicism: Maintaining False Perceptions in Policy Debates|journal=Emory Law Journal|date=2008|volume=57|issue=3|page=535|ssrn=1106690}}&lt;/ref&gt; and more.

==History==

===Early examples from social psychology (1949)===
The idea that people naïvely believe they see things objectively and others do not has been acknowledged for quite some time in the field of [[social psychology]]. For example, while studying social cognition, [[Solomon Asch]] and [[Gustav Ichheiser]] wrote in 1949:

:"[W]e tend to resolve our perplexity arising out of the experience that other people see the world differently than we see it ourselves by declaring that those others, in consequence of some basic intellectual and moral defect, are unable to see the things “as they really are” and to react to them “in a normal way.” We thus imply, of course, that things are in fact as we see them and that our ways are the normal ways."&lt;ref name="Ichheiser"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ichheiser|first1=Gustav|title=Misunderstandings in Human Relations: A Study in False Social Perception|journal=American Journal of Sociology|date=1949|volume=55|issue=2|url=http://psycnet.apa.org/psycinfo/1950-01772-001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Formal laboratory experimentation (1999)===
The formal proposal of naïve cynicism came from Kruger and Gilovich's 1999 study called "'Naive cynicism' in everyday theories of responsibility assessment: On biased assumptions of bias".&lt;ref name="Kruger 1999" /&gt;

==Theory==
The theory of naïve cynicism can be described as:
# I am not [[bias]]ed.
# You are [[bias]]ed if you disagree with me.
# Your intentions/actions reflect your underlying egocentric [[bias]]es.

===A counter to naïve realism ===
As with [[naïve realism]], the theory of naïve cynicism hinges on the acceptance of the following three [[beliefs]]:
# I am not [[bias]]ed.
# Reasonable people are not [[bias]]ed.
# All others are [[bias]]ed.

Naïve cynicism can be thought of as the counter to [[naïve realism (psychology)|naïve realism]], which is the belief that an individual perceives the social world objectively while others perceive it subjectively.&lt;ref name="Baumeister 2007" /&gt;
 
It is important to discern that naïve cynicism is related to the notion that others have an egocentric bias that motivates them to do things for their own self-interest rather than for altruistic reasons.

Both of these theories, however, relate to the extent that adults credit or discredit the beliefs or statements of others.&lt;ref name="Miller 1999"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Miller |first1=Dale |title=The norm of self-interest |journal=American Psychologist |date=December 1999 |volume=54 |issue=12 |pages=1053–1060 |doi=10.1037/0003-066X.54.12.1053}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Relating to psychological egoism===
[[Psychological egoism]] is the belief that humans are always motivated by self-interest.

In a related quote, [[Joel Feinberg]], in his 1958 paper ''"Psychological Egoism"'', embraces a similar critique by drawing attention to the infinite regress of psychological egoism:
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;"All men desire only satisfaction."
"Satisfaction of what?"
"Satisfaction of their desires."
"Their desires for what?"
"Their desires for satisfaction."
"Satisfaction of what?"
"Their desires."
"For what?"
"For satisfaction"—etc., ''[[ad infinitum]]''.&lt;ref name="Feinberg 2008"&gt;[[Joel Feinberg|Feinberg, Joel]]. "Psychological Egoism." In ''Reason &amp; Responsibility: Readings in Some Basic Problems of Philosophy'', edited by Joel Feinberg and [[Russ Shafer-Landau]], 520-532. [[California]]: [[The Thomson Corporation|Thomson Wadsworth]], [[2008 in literature|2008]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The [[circular reasoning]] evidenced by Feinberg's quote exemplifies how this view can be thought of as the need for others to have incessant personal desires and satisfaction.

==Definition==
There are several ways to define naïve cynicism such as:
* The tendency to expect others’ judgments will have a motivational bias and therefore will be biased in the direction of their self-interest.&lt;ref name="Baumeister 2007"&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Baumeister |editor1-first=Roy |editor2-last=Vohs |editor2-first=Kathleen |title=Encyclopedia of Social Psychology |date=August 29, 2007 |publisher=SAGE Publications, Inc. |isbn=978-1-4129-1670-7 |page=601}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Expecting that others are motivationally biased when determining responsibility for positive and negative outcomes.
*The propensity to believe that others are prone to committing the [[fundamental attribution error]],  [[false consensus effect]] or [[self-enhancement]] [[bias]].&lt;ref name="Baumeister 2007" /&gt;
*When our assumptions of others' [[bias]]es exceed their actual [[bias]]es.

==Examples==

===Historical examples===

====Cold War====
The American reaction to a Russian [[Strategic Arms Limitation Talks|SALT]] treaty during the [[Cold War]] is one well-known example of naïve cynicism in history. Political leaders negotiating on behalf of the United States discredited the offer simply because it was proposed by the Russian side.&lt;ref name="Tsay 2011" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ross 1991"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ross|first1=Lee|last2=Stillinger|first2=Constance|title=Barriers to Conflict Resolution|journal=Negotiation Journal|date=1991|volume=7|issue=4|pages=389–404|doi=10.1111/j.1571-9979.1991.tb00634.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Former U.S. congressman Floyd Spence indicates the use of naïve cynicism in this quote:
:"I have had a philosophy for some time in regard to SALT, and it goes like this: the Russians will not accept a SALT treaty that is not in their best interest, and it seems to me that if it is their best interests, it can‘t be in our best interest."&lt;ref name="Ross 1991" /&gt;

===Marketplace===
Consumers exhibit naïve cynicism toward commercial companies and advertisers through suspicion and awareness toward marketing strategies used by such companies.&lt;ref name="Friest"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Friest|first1=Marian|last2=Wright|first2=Peter|title=The Persuasion Knowledge Model: How People Cope with Persuasion Attempts|journal=Journal of Consumer Research|date=June 1994|volume=21|issue=1|pages=1–31|jstor=2489738|doi=10.1086/209380}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Politics===
The public displays naïve cynicism toward governments and political leaders through distrust.&lt;ref name="Jamieson"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jamieson|first1=Kathleen|title=Setting the Record Straight Do Ad Watches Help or Hurt?|journal=The International Journal of Press/Politics|date=January 1997|volume=2|issue=1|pages=13–22|url=http://hij.sagepub.com/content/2/1/13.short|doi=10.1177/1081180x97002001003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Workplace===
Employees of large business organizations frequently exhibit naïve cynicism toward their companies and executives in the workplace through [[employee cynicism]] or [[organizational cynicism]].&lt;ref name="Mirvis"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mirvis|first1=Phillip|last2=Kanter|first2=Donald|title=Combatting cynicism in the workplace|journal=National Productivity Review|date=Fall 1989|volume=8|issue=4|pages=377–394|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/npr.4040080406/abstract|doi=10.1002/npr.4040080406}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Decision-making behavior===
Naïve cynicism can be exemplified in some decision-making behaviors such as:
* '''Negotiations''' / '''Bargaining'''
* '''Economic games'''
** The Acquiring a Company Problem
** The [[Monty Hall Problem]]
* '''Competitive betting'''
** [[Auction]]s

===Other possible real-world examples===
* Overestimating the influence of financial compensation on people’s willingness to give blood. 
* If another person tends to favor himself when interpreting uncertain information, someone exhibiting naïve cynicism would believe the other person is intentionally misleading them for their own advantage.&lt;ref name="Tenbrunsel"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tenbrunsel|first1=Anne|title=Trust as an Obstacle in Environmental-Economic Disputes|journal=American Behavioral Scientist|date=May 1999|volume=42|issue=8|pages=1350–1367|url=http://abs.sagepub.com/content/42/8/1350.short|doi=10.1177/00027649921954895}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Assuming that group membership has a large influence on beliefs and attitudes.&lt;ref name="Miller 1998"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Miller|first1=Dale|last2=Ratner|first2=Rebecca|title=The disparity between the actual and assumed power of self-interest|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|date=1998|volume=74|issue=1|page=53|url=http://europepmc.org/abstract/med/9457775|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.74.1.53}}&lt;/ref&gt;
** If an individual of one political party makes an interpretation or a statement in favor of his own party and thus in accord with his self-interest, other adults discount his statement (especially if they belong to an opposing party).
*** Likewise, if that individual makes a statement against his own self-interest, adults are more likely to believe him.&lt;ref name="Murukutla"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Murukutla|first1=N|last2=Armor|first2=DA|title=Illusions of objectivity in the dispute between India and Pakistan over Kashmir.|journal=Yale University|date=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Resulting negative outcomes==
Naïve cynicism can contribute to several negative outcomes including:

* Over-thinking the actions of others.
* Making negative attributions about others' motivations without sufficient cause.
* Missing opportunities that greater trust might capture.

==Reducing==
The major strategy to attenuate naïve cynicism in individuals has been shown by:

* Viewing the other person as part of one's in-group or acknowledging they are working in cooperation.

As a result of applying this strategy, happier married couples were less likely to exhibit cynical beliefs about each other’s judgments.&lt;ref name="Kruger 1999" /&gt;

Individuals are especially likely to exhibit naïve cynicism when the other person has a vested interest in the judgment at hand. However, if the other person is dispassionate about the judgment at hand, the individual will be less likely to engage in naïve cynicism and think the other person will see things the way they do.&lt;ref name="Kruger 1999" /&gt;

==Psychological contexts==
Naïve cynicism may play a major role in these psychology-related contexts:

===Groups===
In one series of classic experiments by Kruger and Gilovich, groups including video game players, darts players and debaters were asked how often they were responsible for good or bad events relative to their partner. Participants evenly apportioned themselves for both good and bad events, but expected their partner to claim more responsibility for good events than bad events ([[egocentric bias]]) than they actually did.&lt;ref name="Kruger 1999" /&gt;

===Marriage===
In the same study conducted by Kruger and Gilovich, married couples were also examined and ultimately exhibited the same type of naïve cynicism about their marriage partner as did partners of dart players, video game players and debaters.&lt;ref name="Kruger 1999" /&gt;

===Altruism===
Naïve cynicism has been exemplified in the context of altruism. Explanations of selfless human behavior have been described in terms of individuals seeking personal advantage as opposed to absolute [[altruism]].&lt;ref name="Boyd"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Boyd|first1=Robert|last2=Peter|first2=Richerson|title=Solving the puzzle of human cooperation|journal=Evolution and culture|date=2005|pages=105–132|url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.334.6027&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, naïve cynicism would explain the act of an individual donating money or items to charity as a way of self-enhancement rather than for altruistic purposes.

===Dispositionists vs. situationists===
[[Dispositionist]]s are described as individuals who believe people's actions are conditioned by some internal factor, such as beliefs, values, personality traits or abilities, rather than the situation they find themselves in.

Situationists, in contrast, are described as individuals who believe people's actions are conditioned by external factors outside of one's control.

[[Dispositionist]]s exemplify naïve cynicism while situationists do not.&lt;ref name="Chiu 1997"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chiu|first1=Chi-yue|last2=Hong|first2=Ying-yi|title=Lay Dispositionism and Implicit Theories of Personality|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|date=1997|volume=73|issue=1|pages=19–30|url=https://psychology.stanford.edu/sites/all/files/Lay%20Dispositionism%20and%20Implicit%20Theories%20of%20Personality_0.pdf|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.73.1.19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, situationist attributions are often thought to be more accurate than dispositionist attributions. However, dispositionist attributions are commonly believed to be the dominant schema because situationist attributions tend to be dismissed or attacked.

In a direct quote from Benforado and Hanson's paper titled ''"Naïve Cynicism: Maintaining False Perceptions in Policy Debates"'', the situationist and dispositionist are described as:

:"...the naïve cynic is a self-aware—even proud—critic. 
:She speaks what she believes to be the truth, though it may require disparaging her opponents. 
:She senses that she is delving below the surface of the complex arguments of the situationists; she “sees,” for example, the financial interest, the prejudice, or the distorting zealotry that motivates the situationist. 
:She “sees” the bias and self-interest in those who would disagree—while maintaining an affirming view of herself as objective and other-regarding. 
:The naïve cynic, then, is a dispositionist who cynically dispositionalizes the situationist. :She protects fundamentally flawed attributions by attacking the sources of potentially more accurate attributions. 
:The naïve cynic understands (though rarely consciously) that [[the best defense is a good offense]]."&lt;ref name="Benforado 2008" /&gt;

====Examples of differences====
* [[Dispositionist]]s might explain bankruptcy as the largely self-inflicted result of personal laziness and/or imprudence.
* Situationists might explain bankruptcy as frequently caused by more complicated external forces, such as divorce or the medical and other costs of unanticipated illness.&lt;ref name="Norton 2008"&gt;{{cite web|last=Norton|first=Helen|title=Situationism v. Dispositionism|url=http://prawfsblawg.blogs.com/prawfsblawg/2008/05/post1.html|work=article}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applied contexts==
In addition to purely psychological contexts, naïve cynicism may play a major role in several applied contexts such as:

===Negotiations===
Naïve cynicism has been studied extensively in several contexts of negotiating such as bargaining tactics, specifically in the sense that too much naïve cynicism can be costly.&lt;ref name="Tsay 2011" /&gt;

Negotiators displaying naïve cynicism rely on distributive and competitive strategies and focus on gaining concessions rather than on problem-solving. This can be detrimental and lead to reduced information exchange, information concealment, coordination, cooperation and quality of information revealed.&lt;ref name="Tsay 2011" /&gt;

====Reducing naïve cynicism in negotiations====
The following strategies have been identified as ways to reduce naïve cynicism in the context of negotiations:

=====Perspective taking=====

It has been shown that individuals who focus more on the perspectives of their opponents were more successful in experimental laboratory negotiations.

Taking another person's perspective produced better predictions of opponents' goals and biases, though it is noted that many individuals lack the ability to properly change perspectives. These incapable individuals tend to view their opponents as passive and can be prone to ignore valuable information disseminated during negotiations.&lt;ref name="Neale"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Neale|first1=Margaret|last2=Bazerman|first2=Max|title=The Role of Perspective-Taking Ability in Negotiating under Different Forms of Arbitration|journal=ILR Review|date=April 1983|volume=36|issue=3|pages=378–388|url=http://ilr.sagepub.com/content/36/3/378.short|doi=10.1177/001979398303600304}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Negotiator [[role reversal]] is believed to be an important focus of training for individuals to be less inclined to use naïve cynicism during negotiations. This process involves having each negotiator verbally consider their opponents perspective prior to making any judgements.&lt;ref name="Pruitt"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pruitt|first1=Dean|title=Strategy in negotiation|date=1991|publisher=Jossey-Bass|location=San Francisco, California}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Communication=====

It has been shown when [[communication]] between opponents in negotiations is strong, negotiators are more likely to avoid stalemates.&lt;ref name="Bazerman 1998"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bazerman|first1=Max|title=Can negotiators outperform game theory|date=1998|pages=79–99}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Negotiators who exhibit strong communication skills tend to believe integrity should be reciprocally displayed by both sides and thus regard open communication as a positive aspect in negotiations. Those negotiators high in communication skills also tend to view deadlocks as a negative event and will avoid reaching an impasse in order to reach an agreement.&lt;ref name="Bazerman 1998" /&gt;

=====Feedback=====

Despite attempts to reduce errors of naïve cynicism in laboratory studies with [[corrective feedback|error-related feedback]], errors still persisted even after many trials and strong feedback.&lt;ref name="Grosskopf"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Grosskopf|first1=Brit|last2=Bereby-Meyer|first2=Yoella|last3=Bazerman|first3=Max|title=On the robustness of the winner’s curse phenomenon|journal=Theory and Decision|date=2007|volume=63|issue=4|pages=389–418|doi=10.1007/s11238-007-9034-6|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11238-007-9034-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Governmental policy debates===
In relation to governmental policy debates, it is hypothesized that naïve cynicism fosters a distrust of other political parties and entities. Naïve cynicism is thought to be a critical contributor for why certain legal policies succeed and others fail.

For example, naïve cynicism is thought to be a factor contributing to the existence of [[Administrative detention|detention center]]s such as [[Baghdad Central Prison|Abu Ghraib]], [[Guantanamo Bay detention camp|Guantanamo Bay]], [[Parwan Detention Facility|Bagram Air Base]] and more.&lt;ref name="Benforado 2008" /&gt;

==Related biases==
Biases including the following have been argued to be caused at least partially by naïve cynicism:

* [[Negativity bias]]
* [[Fundamental attribution error]]
* [[False-consensus effect]]
* [[Bias blind spot]]
* [[Self-interest]]
* [[Curse of knowledge]]
* [[Hindsight bias]]
* [[Hostile media effect]]
* [[Attitude polarization]]
* [[Reactive devaluation]]
* [[Empathy gap]]s
* Some forms of [[confirmation bias]]

The '''northeastern Iberian script''', also known as '''Levantine Iberian''' or '''Iberian''' because the [[Iberian script]] was the most frequently used, was the main means of written expression of the [[Iberian language]]. The language is also expressed by the [[southeastern Iberian script]] and the [[Greco-Iberian alphabet]]. To understand the relationship between northeastern Iberian and southeastern Iberian scripts, one should point out that they are two different scripts with different values for the same signs. However, it is clear they have a common origin and the most accepted hypothesis is that northeastern Iberian script was derived from the [[southeastern Iberian script]]. Some researchers have concluded that it is linked to the [[Phoenician alphabet]] alone, but others believe the [[Greek alphabet]] also had a role.

==Typology and variants==
All the [[paleohispanic scripts]], with the exception of the [[Greco-Iberian alphabet]], share a common distinctive typological characteristic: they represent syllabic value for the [[occlusives]], and monophonemic value for the rest of the [[consonants]] and [[vowels]]. In a [[writing system]] they are neither [[alphabets]] nor [[syllabaries]], but are rather mixed scripts that are normally identified as [[semi-syllabaries]]. The basic signary contains 28 [[sign (linguistics)|sign]]s: 5 [[vowels]], 15 syllabic and 8 consonantic (one [[Lateral consonant|lateral]], two [[sibilants]], two [[rhotic consonant|rhotic]] and three [[Nasal stop|nasals]]). The northeastern script was very nearly deciphered in 1922 by [[Manuel Gómez-Moreno Martínez]], who systematically linked the [[syllable|syllabic]] signs with the [[occlusive]] values. The decipherment was based on the existence of a large number of [[coin]] legends (some of them bearing [[Latin]] inscriptions) that could easily be linked to ancient place names known from [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] and [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] sources. There are two variants of the northeastern Iberian script: the dual variant is almost exclusive to the ancient inscriptions from the 4th and 3rd centuries BCE and its distinctive characteristic is the use of the dual system. This system was discovered by [[Joan Maluquer de Motes]] in 1968 and allows differentiation of the [[occlusive]] signs ([[Dental consonant|dentals]] and [[velars]]) between [[Voice (phonetics)|voiced]] and [[unvoiced]] by the use of an additional stroke. The simple sign represents the voiced value whilst the complex sign represents the [[unvoiced]] value. The non-dual variant is almost exclusive of the modern inscriptions from the 2nd and 1st centuries BCE. 

==Location of findings==
The inscriptions that use the northeastern Iberian script have been found mainly in the northeastern quadrant of the [[Iberian Peninsula]]: largely along the coast from [[Roussillon]] to [[Alicante]], but also with a deep penetration in the [[Ebro]] Valley. The northeastern Iberian inscriptions have been found on different object types ([[silver]] and [[bronze]] [[coins]], silver and [[ceramic]] recipients, [[lead]] plaques, [[mosaics]], [[amphora|amphores]], stones ([[stele]]s), [[spindle (textiles)|spindle]]-whorls etc.), representing 95% of the total finds (over 2000 items), and nearly all the scripts were written from left to right. The oldest northeastern Iberian script date to the 4th or maybe the 5th century BCE. The modern ones date from the end of the 1st century BCE or maybe the beginning of the 1st century CE.

In recent years four northeastern Iberian abecedaries or signaries have been published: the [[Castellet de Bernabé signary]], the [[Tos Pelat signary]], the [[Ger signary]] and the [[Bolvir signary]], all of them belonging to the dual variant of the script.

'''Nylon-eating bacteria''' are a strain of ''[[Flavobacterium]]'' that are capable of digesting certain [[by-product]]s of [[nylon 6]] manufacture. This strain of ''Flavobacterium'' sp. K172, became popularly known as nylon-eating bacteria, and the enzymes used to digest the man-made molecules became popularly known&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn16834-five-classic-examples-of-gene-evolution/ |author=Michael Le Page |title=Five classic examples of gene evolution |date=March 2009 |website=New Scientist |publisher= |access-date= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; as '''nylonase'''.

==Discovery==
[[File:6-Aminocaproic acid.png|thumb|Chemical structure of [[Aminocaproic acid|6-aminohexanoic acid]]]]
In 1975, a team of Japanese scientists discovered a strain of ''[[Flavobacterium]]'', living in ponds containing [[Wastewater|waste water]] from a [[nylon]] factory, that was capable of digesting certain byproducts of [[nylon 6]] manufacture, such as the linear dimer of [[Aminocaproic acid|6-aminohexanoate]]. These substances are not known to have existed before the invention of [[nylon]] in 1935.

Further study{{Clarify|post-text=(In the same paper, as implied by the position of the reference note?)|date=March 2015}} revealed that the three [[enzyme]]s the [[bacteria]] were using to digest the byproducts were significantly different from any other enzymes produced by other ''Flavobacterium'' strains (or, for that matter, any other bacteria), and not effective on any material other than the manmade nylon byproducts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Kinoshita, S. |author2=Kageyama, S. |author3=Iba, K. |author4=Yamada, Y. |author5=Okada, H. |title=Utilization of a cyclic dimer and linear oligomers of e-aminocaproic acid by Achromobacter guttatus |journal=Agricultural and Biological Chemistry |volume=39 |issue=6 |pages=1219–23 |year=1975 |issn=0002-1369 |doi=10.1271/bbb1961.39.1219}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later research==
This discovery led geneticist [[Susumu Ohno]] in a paper published in April 1984 to speculate that the gene for one of the enzymes, 6-aminohexanoic acid hydrolase, had come about from the combination of a [[gene duplication]] event with a [[frameshift mutation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Ohno S |title=Birth of a unique enzyme from an alternative reading frame of the preexisted, internally repetitious coding sequence |journal=Proc Natl Acad Sci USA |volume=81 |issue=8 |pages=2421–5 |date=April 1984 |pmid=6585807 |pmc=345072 |url=http://www.pnas.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=6585807 |doi=10.1073/pnas.81.8.2421|bibcode=1984PNAS...81.2421O }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ohno suggested that many unique new genes have evolved this way.

A 2007 paper that described a series of studies by a team led by [[Seiji Negoro]] of the [[University of Hyogo]], Japan, suggested that in fact no frameshift mutation was involved in the evolution of the 6-aminohexanoic acid hydrolase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Negoro S, Ohki T, Shibata N, etal |title=Nylon-oligomer degrading enzyme/substrate complex: catalytic mechanism of 6-aminohexanoate-dimer hydrolase |journal=J. Mol. Biol. |volume=370 |issue=1 |pages=142–56 |date=June 2007 |pmid=17512009 |doi=10.1016/j.jmb.2007.04.043 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, many other genes have been discovered which did evolve by gene duplication followed by a frameshift mutation affecting at least part of the gene.{{Citation needed|date=January 2015}}

A 1995 paper showed that scientists have also been able to induce another species of bacterium, ''[[Pseudomonas aeruginosa]]'', to evolve the capability to break down the same nylon byproducts in a laboratory by forcing them to live in an environment with no other source of nutrients.  The ''P. aeruginosa'' strain did not seem to use the same enzymes that had been utilized by the original ''[[Flavobacterium]]'' strain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Prijambada ID, Negoro S, Yomo T, Urabe I |title=Emergence of nylon oligomer degradation enzymes in Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO through experimental evolution |journal=Appl. Environ. Microbiol. |volume=61 |issue=5 |pages=2020–2 |date=May 1995 |pmid=7646041 |pmc=167468 |url=http://aem.asm.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=7646041}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As described in a 1983 publication, other scientists were able to get the ability to generate the enzymes to transfer from the ''Flavobacterium'' strain to a strain of ''[[Escherichia coli|E. coli]]'' bacteria via a [[plasmid]] transfer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Negoro S, Taniguchi T, Kanaoka M, Kimura H, Okada H |title=Plasmid-determined enzymatic degradation of nylon oligomers |journal=J. Bacteriol. |volume=155 |issue=1 |pages=22–31 |date=July 1983 |pmid=6305910 |pmc=217646 |url=http://jb.asm.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=6305910}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Role in evolution teaching==
{{main|Nylon-eating bacteria and creationism}}
There is scientific consensus that the capacity to synthesize nylonase most probably developed as a single-step mutation that survived because it improved the fitness of the bacteria possessing the mutation. More importantly, the enzyme involved was produced by a mutation completely randomizing the original gene. Despite this, the new gene still had a novel, albeit weak, catalytic capacity. This is seen as a good example of how mutations easily can provide the raw material for [[evolution]] by [[natural selection]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Thwaites WM |title=New Proteins Without God's Help |journal=Creation Evolution Journal |volume=5 |issue=2 |pages=1–3 |date=Summer 1985 |url=http://ncse.com/cej/5/2/new-proteins-without-gods-help}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nmsr.org/nylon.htm Evolution and Information: The Nylon Bug]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/9452500/page/2/ Why scientists dismiss 'intelligent design'], Ker Than, [[MSNBC]],  Sept. 23, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Miller, Kenneth R.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3288">'''''Peace dividend''''' is a political slogan popularized by US President [[George H.W. Bush]] and UK Prime Minister [[Margaret Thatcher]] in the early 1990s, purporting to describe the [[economics|economic]] benefit of a decrease in defense spending.  It is used primarily in discussions relating to the [[guns versus butter theory]].  The term was frequently used at the end of the [[Cold War]], when many [[Western world|Western nations]] significantly cut [[military spending]] (such as Britain's [[Options for Change]] defence review).

==Real or not?==
While economies do undergo a [[recession]] after the end of a major conflict as the economy is forced to adjust and retool, a "peace dividend" refers to a potential long-term benefit as budgets for defense spending are assumed  to be at least partially redirected to social programs and/or a decrease in taxation rates.  The existence of a peace dividend in real economies is still debated, but some research points to its reality.&lt;ref&gt;Sanjeev Gupta, Benedict Clements, Rina Bhattacharya, and Shamit Chakravarti (2002), [http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/fandd/2002/12/gupta.htm "The Elusive Peace Dividend"] at ''[[Finance &amp; Development]]'', a quarterly magazine of the IMF.&lt;/ref&gt;

A political discussion about the peace dividend resulting from the end of the [[Cold War]] involves a debate about which countries have actually scaled back military spending and which have not. The scale back in defense spending was mainly noticeable in [[Western Europe]] and in the [[Russian Federation]]. The [[United States]], whose military spending was rapidly reducing between 1985 and 1993 and remained flat between 1993 and 1999,&lt;ref name="priorities"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nationalpriorities.org/u_s_military_spending|title=U.S. military spending|publisher=[[National Priorities Project]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; has dramatically increased it after [[September 11, 2001]] to fund conflicts like the [[War on Terror]], the [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|War in Afghanistan]] and the [[War in Iraq]].

==Other uses==
"Peace dividend" can also refer to the improved economy in [[Northern Ireland]] after the signing of the [[Good Friday Agreement]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2008/05/06/us-irish-economy-idUSL0283780420080506 |title=Northern Ireland looks to make peace dividend pay |first=Jonathan |last=Saul |work=Reuters |publisher=Thomson Reuters |date=5 May 2008 |accessdate=22 October 2012 |quote=Northern Ireland's authorities hope that era, which claimed over 3,600 lives and was known as [[The Troubles]], is now closed, and they say they are already reaping a peace dividend. In the past 10 years, over 100,000 jobs have been created, and the unemployment rate now stands at around 4.2 percent, below the UK average of about 5.2 percent. Economic growth in Northern Ireland averaged around 2.9 to 3 percent from 1996 to 2007, which was above the United Kingdom's average of around 2.8 percent.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Silence and Respect.jpg|thumb|right|A sign entreating "silence and respect" at [[Arlington National Cemetery]]]]
'''Respect''' is a positive feeling or action shown towards someone or something considered important, or held in high esteem or regard; it conveys a sense of admiration for good or valuable qualities; and it is also the process of honoring someone by exhibiting care, concern, or consideration for their needs or feelings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/respect|title=Definition of RESPECT|work=Merriam Webster|accessdate = December 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/respect|title=Definition of "respect"|work=Cambridge Dictionary|accessdate = December 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some people may earn the respect of individuals by assisting others or by playing important social roles. In many cultures, individuals are considered to be worthy of respect until they prove otherwise. Courtesies that show respect include simple words and phrases like "thank you" in the West, simple physical [[gesture]]s like a slight bow in the East, a smile, or direct eye contact, or a simple handshake.

== Signs and other ways of knowing respect ==

=== Language ===

Respect is shown in many different languages by following certain grammatical conventions, especially in referring to individuals.

An [[honorific]] is a word or expression (often a [[pronoun]]) that shows respect when used in addressing or referring to a person or animal.

Typically honorifics are used for second and third persons; use for first person is less common. Some languages have anti-honorific first person forms (like "your most humble servant" or "this unworthy person") whose effect is to enhance the relative honor accorded a second or third person.

For instance, it is disrespectful to not use polite language and honorifics when speaking in Japanese with someone having a higher social status. The Japanese honorific "san" can be used when speaking English.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fodors.com/world/asia/japan/tokyo/features.html|title=Top Experiences in Tokyo - Fodor's Travel|website=www.fodors.com|accessdate=22 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In China it is rude to call someone by their first name unless you have known them for a long period of time. In work-related situations, people address each other by their title. At home people often refer to each other by nicknames or terms of kinship.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;
[http://www.protocolprofessionals.com/articles_china.htm Protocol Professionals, Inc. | Chinese Etiquette &amp; Protocol]&lt;/ref&gt;
In the Chinese culture, individuals often address their friends as juniors and seniors even if they are just a few months younger or older. When a Chinese person asks someone their age they often do this so they know how to address the person.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

=== Physical gestures ===

In Islamic cultures around the world, there are many ways to show respect to people. For example, it is recommended to kiss the hands of parents, grandparents and teachers. Also, it is narrated in the sayings of Muhammad that if a person looks at the faces of parents and teachers with a smile, he will definitely be rewarded by Allah with success and happiness.

In [[India]], it is customary that, out of respect, when a person's foot accidentally touches a book or any written material (considered to be a manifestations of [[Saraswati]], the goddess of knowledge) or another person's leg, it will be followed by an apology in the form of a single hand gesture ([[Pranāma]]) with the right hand, where the offending person first touches the object with the finger tips and then the forehead and/or chest. This also counts for money, which is considered to be a manifestation of the goddess of wealth [[Lakshmi]].&lt;ref&gt;DeBruyn, Pippa; Bain, Keith; Venkatraman, Niloufer (2010). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=qG-9cwHOcCIC Frommer's India]''. pp. 76.&lt;/ref&gt; Pranāma, or the touching of feet in Indian culture is a sign of respect. For instance, when a child is greeting his or her grandparent, they typically will touch their hands to their grandparents' feet. In Indian culture, it is believed that the feet are a source of power and love.&lt;ref&gt;Chatterjee, Gautam (2001). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=NQ0XQHEkuIcC Sacred Hindu Symbols]''. pp. 47-48.&lt;/ref&gt;

In many African/West Indian descent communities and some non-African//West Indian descent communities, respect can be signified by the touching of fists.

Many gestures or physical acts that are common in the West can be considered disrespectful in Japan. For instance, one should not point directly at someone.&lt;ref name="fodors.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fodors.com/world/asia/japan/tokyo/feature_30007.html|title=Lodging Options - Experience Tokyo|date=31 October 2007|website=archive.org|accessdate=22 October 2017|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071031054529/http://www.fodors.com/world/asia/japan/tokyo/feature_30007.html|archivedate=31 October 2007|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; When greeting someone or thanking them, it may be insulting if the person of lower status does not bow lower than the person with higher status. The duration and level of the bow depends on many factors such as age and status.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://westsidetoastmasters.com/resources/book_of_body_language/chap5.html|title=Cultural Variations In Body Language|website=westsidetoastmasters.com|accessdate=22 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some signs of physical respect apply to women only. If a woman does not wear cosmetics or a brassiere, it is possible that she will be considered unprofessional or others may think she does not care about the situation.&lt;ref name="fodors.com"/&gt;

==== Chinese culture ====
{{See also|Category:Chinese honorifics}}

Unlike Japanese culture, it is not necessary in Chinese culture to bow to one another as a greeting or parting gesture. Bowing is generally reserved as a sign of respect for elders and ancestors. When bowing, they place the fist of the right hand in the palm of their left at stomach level. The deeper the bow, the more respect they are showing.

In Chinese culture, there is not much participation in physical contact, especially when doing business because this can be seen as too casual, thus disrespectful. It is considered rude to slap, pat, or put one's arm around the shoulders of another.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.commisceo-global.com/country-guides/china-guide|title=China - Language, Culture, Customs and Etiquette|website=www.commisceo-global.com|accessdate=22 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[affection]] in same-sex [[friendships]] in East Asia is much more pronounced than in the West. Same-sex friends will often be seen with their arms around one another, holding hands, and other signs of physical affection.&lt;ref&gt;Kline, et al. "Communicating love: Comparisons between American and East Asian university students." ''International Journal of Intercultural Relations''. no. 32 (2008): 200-2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is uncommon to see very many hand gestures being used in Chinese culture because this is often considered to be excessive.
&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; The Chinese sometimes do not smile or exchange greetings with strangers. Smiling or being friendly to someone you do not know well can be considered rude and too familiar. It is also common to see Chinese women covering their mouths when they laugh. Traditionally, a woman who laughed too loudly was considered to be uncouth and ill-bred.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

Traditionally, there was not much hand-shaking in Chinese culture. However, this gesture is now widely practiced among men, especially when greeting Westerners or other foreigners. Many Westerners may find Chinese handshakes to be too long or too weak, but this is because a weaker handshake is a gesture of humility and respect.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

[[Kowtowing]], or kneeling and bowing so deeply that one's forehead is touching the floor, is practiced during worship at temples. Kowtowing is a powerful gesture reserved mainly for honoring the dead or offering deep respect at a temple.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

Many codes of behavior revolve around young people showing respect to older people. Like in many cultures, younger Chinese individuals are expected to defer to older people, let them speak first, sit down after them and not contradict them. Sometimes when an older person enters a room, everyone stands. People are often introduced from oldest to youngest. Often time, younger people will go out of their way to open doors for their elders and not cross their legs in front of them. The older you are the more respect you are expected to be treated with.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

== Respect as a cultural value==
[[File:Respeitoplaca.JPG|right|thumb|200px|[[Sign]] in [[São João da Barra]] saying ''"respect if you want to be respected"''.]]

=== Indigenous American culture ===
In many [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous American societies]] the perspective on respect differs slightly because it serves as an important concept valued in their culture's context. Aside from meaning positive feelings of esteem or deference is also viewed as a moral value that teaches indigenous individuals about their culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fernandez|first1=David-Lorente|title=Ser respetuoso es ser persona. El niño y la pedagogía moral de Los Nahuas del Centro de México|journal=Revista de Dialectología y Tradiciones Populares|date=2012|volume=67|issue=2|pages=431|doi=10.3989/rdtp.2012.16}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, this moral value is treated as a process that influences certain participation in the community and also helps the individual develop and become integrated into their culture's community. During childhood is when this value of respect is taught because indigenous children participating in and learning about their community is an important aspect of the culture.

Respect as a form of behavior and participation is especially important in childhood as it serves as a basis of how the child must conduct themselves in their community. Children engage in mature activities such as cooking for the family, cleaning and sweeping the house, caring for infant peers, and crop work. Indigenous children learn to view their participation in these activities are a representation of respect. Through his manner of participation of activities of respect is how children not only learn about culture but also practice it as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://usa.gov|title=Official Guide to Government Information and Services  - USAGov|website=usa.gov|accessdate=22 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Respect for Authority (Christianity) ===

The Christian faith specifically recognizes respect for Authority throughout the Bible, including parental authority ([[Ten Commandments|Ten Commandments]]), civil authority and divine authority.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.truthmagazine.com/archives/volume33/GOT033159.html|title=Respect for Authority|website=truthmagazine.com|accessdate=14 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.com/bitesize/guides/zfhf9j6/revision/1 |title=Sources of Authority |newspaper=[[BBC]] |accessdate=October 28, 2018 |deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt;

First of all, then, I urge that entreaties ''and'' prayers, petitions ''and'' thanksgivings, be made on behalf of all men, for kings and all who are in &lt;sup&gt;[a]&lt;/sup&gt;authority, so that we may lead a tranquil and quiet life in all godliness and &lt;sup&gt;[b]&lt;/sup&gt;dignity.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1797">'''Scottish Assessors''' (the '''Scottish Assessors Association''', SSA) is a voluntary, non-statutory association of [[Assessor (property)|land valuation assessors]] and their senior staff in [[Scotland]]. The association encourages a consistent approach to the administration of [[valuation (rates)|valuation]], [[council tax]] and [[Electoral registration in the United Kingdom|electoral registration]].

Founded in 1975, in conjunction with the abolition of the [[Scottish counties]], Scottish Assessors is the successor to the ''Association of Lands Valuation Assessors of Scotland'', founded in 1957, and the ''Association of Lands Valuation Assessors'', founded in 1886.

The SAA liaises with the [[Valuation Office Agency]] of England and Wales, the [[Valuation Office]] (Oifig Luachála) of Ireland, and the [[Land and Property Service]] in Northern Ireland.

==Assessors==
Scottish [[Assessor (property)|Assessors]] are independent public officials who decide the rateable value of property listed on a local valuation roll. They must be members of the [[Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors]] and work under the umbrella body, the Scottish Assessors Association.

Several groups of [[tetrapods]] have undergone '''secondary aquatic adaptation''', an evolutionary transition from being purely [[Terrestrial_animal|terrestrial]] to living at least part of the time in water. These animals are called "secondarily aquatic" because although their ancestors lived on land for hundreds of millions of years, they all originally descended from aquatic animals (see [[Evolution of tetrapods]]). These ancestral tetrapods had never left the water, and were thus '''primarily aquatic''', like modern [[Fish|fishes]]. Secondary aquatic [[adaptation (biology)|adaptation]]s tend to develop in early speciation as the animal ventures into water in order to find available food. As successive generations spend more time in the water, [[natural selection]] causes the acquisition of more adaptations. Animals of later generations may spend the majority of their life in the water, coming ashore for mating. Finally, fully adapted animals may take to mating and birthing in water.

==Anapsid==
{{main|Anapsid}}
''[[Archelon]]'' is a type of giant [[sea turtle]] dating from the [[Cretaceous]] Period, now long extinct.  Its smaller cousins survive as the [[sea turtles]] of today.

''[[Mesosaurus]]'' (and other mesosaurids) were another group of anapsid [[reptiles]] to secondarily return to the sea, eschewing shells, and are also long extinct.

==Diapsid==
{{main|Diapsid}}
Living at the same time as, but not closely related to, dinosaurs, the [[mosasaur]]s resembled crocodiles but were more strongly adapted to marine life. They became extinct 66 million years ago, at the same time as the dinosaurs. 

Modern diapsids which have made their own adaptions to allow them to spend significant time in the water include marine [[iguana]]s and marine [[crocodile]]s. [[Sea snakes]] are extensively adapted to the marine environment, giving birth to live offspring in the same way as the Euryapsida (see below) and are largely incapable of terrestrial activity.  The arc of their adaptation is evident by observing the primitive [[Laticauda]] genus, which must return to land to lay eggs.

==Euryapsida==
{{main|Euryapsida}}
These marine reptiles had ancestors who moved back into the oceans. In the case of [[ichthyosaur]]s adapting as fully as the [[dolphins]] they superficially resemble, even giving birth to live offspring instead of laying eggs. Euryapsida is now no longer considered a valid taxonomic group (Motani, 2009).

==Cetacea==
{{Main|Cetacea|Evolution of cetaceans}}
During the [[Paleocene]] Epoch (about 66 - 55 million years ago), a group of [[wolf]]-like [[artiodactyl]]s related to ''[[Pakicetus]]'' began pursuing an amphibious lifestyle in rivers or shallow seas. They were the ancestors of modern whales, dolphins, and porpoises. The cetacea are extensively adapted to marine life and cannot survive on land at all. Their adaptation can be seen in many unique physiognomic characteristics such as the dorsal [[blowhole (anatomy)|blowhole]], [[baleen]] teeth, and the cranial 'melon' organ used for aquatic [[Animal echolocation|echolocation]]. The closest extant terrestrial relative to the whale is the [[hippopotamus]], which spends much of its time in the water and whose name literally means "horse of the river".

==Sirenians==
{{main|Sirenian|Evolution of sirenians}}
The ancestors of the [[dugong]] and [[manatee]]s first appeared in the fossil record about 45 to 50 million years ago in the ocean.

==Pinnipeds==
{{main|Pinniped}}
The fossil records show that [[phocid]]s existed 12 to 15 million years ago, and [[odobenid]]s about 14 million years ago. Their common ancestor must have existed even earlier than that.

==Polar bears==
{{main|Polar bear}}
Although polar bears spend most of their time on the ice rather than in the water, polar bears show the beginnings of aquatic adaptation to swimming (high levels of body fat and nostrils that are able to close), diving, and thermoregulation. Distinctly polar bear fossils can be dated to about 100,000 years ago. The polar bear has thick fur and layers of fat on its body to protect it from the cold.

==Speculative theories==
===Humans===
{{main|Aquatic ape hypothesis}}
Proponents of the aquatic ape hypothesis believe that part of [[human evolution]] includes some aquatic adaptation, which has been said to explain human hairlessness, [[bipedalism]], increased [[subcutaneous fat]], [[Larynx#Descended larynx|descended larynx]], [[vernix caseosa]], a hooded [[human nose|nose]] and various other physiological and anatomical changes. The idea is not accepted by most scholars who study human evolution.&lt;ref name = Meier&gt;{{cite book | last = Meier | first = R | title = The complete idiot's guide to human prehistory | publisher = Alpha Books | year = 2003 | isbn = 0-02-864421-2 | pages = [https://books.google.com/books?id=r_Wit4KYSmMC&amp;pg=PA57 57–59]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="30243">The '''self-reference effect''' is a tendency for people to encode information differently depending on the level on which they are implicated in the information. When people are asked to remember information when it is related in some way to themselves, the recall rate can be improved.&lt;ref name=Self-reference&gt;{{Citation |last=Rogers |first=Timothy B. |last2=Kuiper |first2=Nicholas A. |last3=Kirker |first3=W.S. |title=Self-Reference and the Encoding of Personal Information |year=1977 |journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology |volume=35 |issue=9 |pages=677–678 |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.35.9.677 |pmid=909043}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==
In 1955, [[George Kelly (psychologist)|George Kelly]] published his theory about how humans create [[personal construct]]s. This was a more general cognitive theory based on the idea that each individual's psychological processes are influenced by the way they anticipate events. This lays the groundwork for the ideas of personal constructs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Psychology of Personal Constructs |last=Kelly |first=George |year=1955 |publisher=Norton |location=New York |isbn=9780230008410}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Attribution theory]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Jones |first=E. E. |title=Attribution: Perceiving the causes of success and failure |year=1971 |publisher=General Learning Press |location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;  is an explanation of the way people attribute the causes of behavior and events, which also involved creating a construct of self, since people can explain things related to themselves differently from the same thing happening to someone else. Related to the attribution theory, the fundamental attribution error&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Tal-Or |first1=Nurit |last2=Papirman |first2=Yael |title=The Fundamental Attribution Error in Attributing Fictional Figures' Characteristics to the Actors |journal=Media Psychology |date=2007 |volume=9 |issue=2 |pages=331–345 |doi=10.1080/15213260701286049}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an explanation of when an individual explains someone's given behavior in a situation through emphasis on internal characteristics (personality) rather than considering the situation's external factors. Studies such as one by Jones, Sensenig, and Haley&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Jones |first=R. A. |last2=Sensenig |first2=J. |last3=Haley |first3=J. V. |title=Self-descriptions: Configurations of content and order effects |year=1974 |journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology |volume=30 |issue=1 |pages=36–45 |doi=10.1037/h0036674|pmid=4427215 }}&lt;/ref&gt; corroborated the idea that the self has a special construct, by simply asking experiment subjects to describe their "most significant characteristics". The results showed that the majority of responses were based on positive characteristics such as "sensitive", "intelligent", and "friendly". This ties in very well with other cognitive phenomena such as [[illusory superiority]], in that it is a well observed fact that people rate themselves differently from how they rate others. In 2012, Stanley B. Klein published an article on the self and memory and how it relates to the self-reference effect. In recent years, studies on the self-reference effect have shifted from identifying mechanisms to using the self-reference as a research tool in understanding the nature of memory. Klein discusses words encoded with respect to oneself (the self-relevance effect) are recalled more often than words that are unrelated to the self.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Klein |first1=Stanley B. |title=Self, Memory, and the Self-Reference Effect |journal=Personality and Social Psychology Review |date=2012 |volume=16 |issue=3 |pages=283–300 |doi=10.1177/1088868311434214|pmid=22291045 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Japan, regarding memory, people who showed higher altruism tend not to exhibit self-reference effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nakao|first=Takashi|last2=Tokunaga|first2=Satoko|last3=Takamura|first3=Masahiro|last4=Nashiwa|first4=Hitomi|last5=Hayashi|first5=Shunsuke|last6=Miyatani|first6=Makoto|date=January 2012|title=Altruistic people show no self-reference effect in memory|journal=The Journal of General Psychology|volume=139|issue=1|pages=29–41|doi=10.1080/00221309.2011.642027|issn=1940-0888|pmid=24836719}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Associated brain regions==

===Cortical mid-line structures===

In recent years,{{when|date=February 2018}} there has been an increase in [[cognitive neuroscience]] studies that focus on the concept of the [[self]]. These studies were developed in hopes of determining if there are certain brain regions that can account for the [[Encoding (memory)|encoding]] advantages involved in the self-reference effect. A great deal of research has been focused on several regions of the brain collectively identified as the cortical midline region. Brain imaging studies have raised the question of whether neural activity in cortical midline regions is self-specific. A [[Quantitative research|quantitative]] [[meta-analysis]] that included 87 studies, representing 1433 participants, was conducted to discuss these questions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|year = 2011|doi = 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2011.05.028|pmid = 21609772|title = How is our self related to midline regions and the default-mode network?|journal = NeuroImage|volume = 57|issue = 3|pages =  1221–1233|last1 = Qin|first1 = Pengmin|last2 = Northoff|first2 = Georg}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[analysis]] uncovered activity within several cortical midline structures in activities in which participants performed tasks involving the concept of self. Most studies that report such midline activations use tasks that are geared towards uncovering [[Biological neural network|neural processes]] that are related to social or psychological aspects of the self, such as self-referential judgments, [[Appraisal theory|self-appraisal]], and judgments of [[Personality trait|personality]] traits. Also, in addition to their perceived role in several forms of self-representation, cortical midline structures are also involved in the processing of [[social relationships]] and recognizing personally familiar others. Studies that show midline activations during understanding of social interactions between others or ascribing social traits to others ([[impression formation]]) typically require subjects to reference the [[Cognitive psychology|mental state]] of others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|year = 2007|doi = 10.1016/j.tics.2007.01.001|pmid = 17300981|title = The self and social cognition: The role of cortical midline structures and mirror neurons|journal = Trends in Cognitive Sciences|volume = 11|issue = 4|pages = 153–157|last1 = Uddin|first1 = Lucina Q.|last2 = Iacoboni|first2 = Marco|last3 = Lange|first3 = Claudia|last4 = Keenan|first4 = Julian Paul}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Prefrontal cortex===

There are several areas within the cortical midline structure that are believed to be associated with the self-reference effect. One of the more active regions involved in the self-reference effect appears to be the [[medial prefrontal cortex]] (mPFC). The [[prefrontal cortex]] (PFC) is the area of the brain that is believed to be involved in the planning of complex [[behavior]] and the expression and regulation of personality characteristics in social situations. The implication that the prefrontal cortex is involved in the regulation of unique internal personality characteristics illustrates how it may be an important component of the self-reference effect. The medial prefrontal cortex in both [[Brain hemisphere|hemispheres]] has been proposed as a site of the "self model" which is a theoretical construct made of essential features such as feelings of continuity and unity as well as [[Sense of agency|experience of agency]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi = 10.1037/0033-2909.131.1.76|pmid = 15631554|title = Is Self Special? A Critical Review of Evidence from Experimental Psychology and Cognitive Neuroscience|journal = Psychological Bulletin|volume = 131|issue = 1|pages = 76–97|year = 2005|last1 = Gillihan|first1 = Seth J.|last2 = Farah|first2 = Martha J.|citeseerx = 10.1.1.510.8989}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea of the self-reference effect being linked to the medial prefrontal cortex stems from several experiments attempting to locate the [[Mechanism (biology)|mechanisms]] involved in the self-referencing process. Experiments in which participants were assigned tasks that required them to reflect on, or [[Introspection|introspect]] about their own mental states showed activity in the medial prefrontal cortex. For example, activity in the [[ventromedial prefrontal cortex]] has been observed in tasks in which participants report on their own personalities or preferences, adopt a first person perspective, or reflect on their current [[Affect (psychology)|affective state]]. Similar activity in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex is displayed in cases where participants show the memory advantage that emerges when items are encoded in a self-relevant manner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi = 10.1162/0898929055002418|pmid = 16197685|title = The Link between Social Cognition and Self-referential Thought in the Medial Prefrontal Cortex|journal = Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience|volume = 17|issue = 8|pages = 1306–1315|year = 2005|last1 = Mitchell|first1 = Jason P.|last2 = Banaji|first2 = Mahzarin R.|last3 = MacRae|first3 = C. Neil|citeseerx = 10.1.1.650.7023}}&lt;/ref&gt; During various [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]] (fMRI) tests conducted while participants were performing self-referential tasks, there was a consistent showing of increases in [[blood-oxygen-level dependent]] (BOLD) signals in the ventral medial and dorsal medial prefrontal cortex.&lt;ref name=Sajonz2010&gt;{{cite journal|year = 2010|doi = 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2010.01.087|pmid = 20123026|title = Delineating self-referential processing from episodic memory retrieval: Common and dissociable networks|journal = NeuroImage|volume = 50|issue = 4|pages = 1606–1617|last1 = Sajonz|first1 = Bastian|last2 = Kahnt|first2 = Thorsten|last3 = Margulies|first3 = Daniel S.|last4 = Park|first4 = Soyoung Q.|last5 = Wittmann|first5 = André|last6 = Stoy|first6 = Meline|last7 = Ströhle|first7 = Andreas|last8 = Heinz|first8 = Andreas|last9 = Northoff|first9 = Georg|last10 = Bermpohl|first10 = Felix}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Measuring BOLD signals is necessary for a sound interpretation of fMRI signals, as BOLD fMRI reflects a complex monitoring of changes in [[cerebral blood flow]], cerebral [[blood volume]] and [[Hemoglobin|blood oxygenation]].&lt;ref name="Logothetis2007"/&gt;

===Parietal lobe===

In addition to areas of the prefrontal cortex, research has suggested that there are areas within the [[parietal lobe]] that also play a role in activating the self-reference effect. During fMRI given during self-referential tasks there also appeared to be increases in BOLD signals within the [[Human anatomical terms|medial and lateral]] parietal cortex&lt;ref name=Sajonz2010/&gt; To further determine whether or not the medial parietal lobe plays a role in self-referencing, participants were subjected to [[transcranial magnetic stimulation]] over the region. Stimulation over this region produced a decrease in the ability of participants to [[Knowledge retrieval|retrieve]] previous judgments of mental self when compared to the retrieval of judgment of others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|year = 2006|doi = 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2005.12.002|pmid = 16466680|title = Self-referential processing in our brain—A meta-analysis of imaging studies on the self|journal = NeuroImage|volume = 31|issue = 1|pages = 440–457|last1 = Northoff|first1 = Georg|last2 = Heinzel|first2 = Alexander|last3 = De Greck|first3 = Moritz|last4 = Bermpohl|first4 = Felix|last5 = Dobrowolny|first5 = Henrik|last6 = Panksepp|first6 = Jaak}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development over the lifespan==

===Childhood===

The development of a sense of self and the understanding that one is separate and uniquely different from others is vital in the development of the self-reference effect advantage. As young children grow, their sense of self and understanding of the world around them is continuously increasing. Although this occurs at different stages for each child, research has shown rather early development of the self-reference advantage. Research focusing on the [[Recall (memory)|recall]] abilities of children have shown the self-referencing advantage in children as young as five years old.&lt;ref name=Sui2005&gt;{{cite journal|doi = 10.1080/01650250500172673|title = Five-Year-Olds Can Show the Self-Reference Advantage|journal = International Journal of Behavioral Development|volume = 29|issue = 5|pages = 382–387|year = 2005|last1 = Sui|first1 = Jie|last2 = Zhu|first2 = Ying}}&lt;/ref&gt; Language development appears to play a significant role in the development and use of the self-reference effect. [[Labelling|Verbal labeling]] is among the first strategic behaviors shown by young children in order to enhance memory, and as children progress in age and language development, their performance on memory tasks involving self-referencing increases.&lt;ref name=Sui2005/&gt; A study done in 2011 on preschoolers found that observations on children as young as three years old suggests that the self-reference effect is apparent in event memory, by their ability to self-recognize.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ross |first1=Josephine |last2=Anderson |first2=James R. |last3=Campbell |first3=Robin N. |title=I remember me: Implications, limitations, and applications |journal=Monographs of the Society for Research in Child Development |date=2011 |volume=76 |issue=3 |pages=68–79 |doi=10.1111/j.1540-5834.2011.00618.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Adulthood===

Like children, the continuous development of a self-concept is related to the development of self-referencing in individuals. The relationships formed with intimate others over the lifespan appear to have an effect on self-referencing in relation to memory. The extent to which we include others in our self-concept has been a topic of particular interest for social psychologists. Theories of intimacy and personal relationships might suggest that the self-reference effect is affected by the closeness of a relationship with the other used as a target. Some researchers define closeness as an extension of self into other and suggest that one's cognitive processes about a close other develop in a way so as to include that person as part of the self. Consistent with this idea, it has been demonstrated that the memorial advantage afforded to self-referenced material can be diminished or eliminated when the comparison target is an intimate other such as a parent, friend, or spouse&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi = 10.1093/scan/nsl001|pmid = 18985097|pmc = 2555408|title = Medial prefrontal activity differentiates self from close others|journal = Social Cognitive and Affective Neuroscience|volume = 1|issue = 1|pages = 18–25|year = 2006|last1 = Heatherton|first1 = Todd F.|last2 = Wyland|first2 = Carrie L.|last3 = MacRae|first3 = C. Neil|last4 = Demos|first4 = Kathryn E.|last5 = Denny|first5 = Bryan T.|last6 = Kelley|first6 = William M.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The capacity for utilizing the self-reference effect remains relatively high throughout the lifespan, even well into old age. Normally functioning older adults can benefit from self-referencing. Ageing is marked by cognitive impairments in a number of domains including [[long-term memory]], but [[older adults]]' memory performance is malleable. Memory strategies and orientations that engage "deep" encoding processes benefit older adults. For example, older adults exhibit increased recall when using self-generated strategies that rely on personally relevant information (e.g., important birthdates) relative to other [[Mnemonic|mnemonic strategies]] However, research has shown that there are some differences between older adults and younger adults use of the self-reference advantage. Like young adults, older adults exhibit superior recognition for self-referenced items. But the amount of cognitive resources an individual has influence on how much older adults benefit from self referencing. Self-referencing improves older adult's memory, but its benefits are restricted regardless of the social and personally relevant nature of the task.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi = 10.1080/09658210701701394|pmid = 18033620|title = Ageing and the self-reference effect in memory|journal = Memory|volume = 15|issue = 8|pages = 822–837|year = 2007|last1 = Gutchess|first1 = Angela H.|last2 = Kensinger|first2 = Elizabeth A.|last3 = Yoon|first3 = Carolyn|last4 = Schacter|first4 = Daniel L.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A reason for this change in self referencing may be the change in brain activation that has been observed in older adults when studying self-referencing. Older adults showed more activity in the medial prefrontal cortex and along the [[cingulate gyrus]] than young adults. Because these regions often are associated with self-referential processing, these results suggest that older adults' mnemonic boost for positive information may stem from an increased tendency to process this information in relation to themselves. It has been proposed that this "positivity shift" may occur because older adults put more emphasis on emotion regulation goals than do young adults, with older adults having a greater motivation to derive emotional meaning from life and to maintain positive affect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|year = 2008|doi = 10.1162/jocn.2008.20080|pmid = 18284340|title = Neural Processes Supporting Young and Older Adults' Emotional Memories|journal = Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience|volume = 20|issue = 7|pages = 1161–1173|last1 = Kensinger|first1 = Elizabeth A.|last2 = Schacter|first2 = Daniel L.|citeseerx = 10.1.1.537.3525}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Effect on students ==
Students are often challenged when faced with the attempt to recall memories.  It is therefore import to understand the effects of self-reference encoding for students and beneficial ways it can increase their recall of information. The purpose of the current study was to examine the effects of, self-referent encoding.

Rogers, Kuiper, and Kirker (1977) performed one of the first studies examining the self-reference effect making it a foundational article.  The focus of the study was to identify the importance of the self and how it is implicated when processing personal information.  The self-reference effect has been considered a robust encoding strategy and has been effective over the past 30 years (Gutches et al., 2007).  The process behind this study was to gather students and divide them into four different task groups and they would be asked to give a yes or no answer to a trait adjective being presented to them.  The four tasks that were used were: structural, phonemic, semantic, and self-reference.  There were some different theories that support the study.  The personality theory stressed that the observer's network when looking at the trait adjectives is an essential part of how they process personal information Hastorf et al. (1970).  Another theory that supports this study is the attribution theory. It is another example where a person's organization traits fit with the self-reference effect Jones et al. (1971). The self is visualized as a schema that is involved with processing personal information, interpretation, and memories which is considered a powerful and effective process (Rogers et al., 1977).

Gutchess, Kensinger, and Schacter (2007) performed a study where they used age as a factor when looking at the self-reference effect.  The first and second experiment looks at the young and older adults and they are presented with encoded adjectives and they must decide if it describes them.  The third experiment is deciding if they found these traits desirable towards themselves.  The age difference was shown effective with the self-reference effect leaving the older adults showing superiority of recognition for self-referenced items that were relative.  Although, self-referencing the older adults did not have the same restoring level as the younger adults.  A major factor that played in this study was the availability of cognitive resources. When there was a greater availability of cognitive resources, the ability to enhance memory similarly for both young and older adults diverged from socioemotional processing (Gutches et al., 2007).

Hartlep and Forsyth (2001) performed a study using two different approaches when studying for an exam.  The first approach was the survey, question, read, reflect, recite, and review method which is called the SQR4.  The other method was the self-reference method.  The third group was a controlled group and received no special instructions on their studying process (Hartlep &amp; Forsyth, 2001).  This study is considered an applied study.  People who have a more elaborative cognitive framework, the better they will be able to retrieve a memory.  The most elaborative cognitive framework someone can have is knowledge of themselves (Hartlep &amp; Forsyth, 2001).  The self-reference effect is viable when having strict lab conditions. When students are studying, if they can see the material as an elaboration of what they already remember or can relate to personal experiences, their recall would be enhanced (Hartlep &amp; Forsyth, 2001). Although, the self-reference method can enhance recall of memory in certain instances, unfortunately for this study, there were no significant differences between the two study methods.

Serbun, Shih and Gutchess (2011) performed a study involving the effects of general and specific memory when using the self-reference effect. The study created a gap in research due to the experiments being tested.  The first experiment uses visuals details of objects where the second and third experiment use verbal memory to assess the self-reference effect.  The self-reference effect enhances both general and specific memory and can improve the accuracy and richness of a memory (Serbun et al., 2011).  We know how the self-reference effect works, but instead of using trait adjectives to assess recall, we are looking at trait adjectives.  The results from the experiments show that self-referencing does not function only through the increase in familiarity or general memory for the object, but enhances memory for details of an event.  This likely draws on more recollected processes. This information supports that self-referencing is effective of encoding a rich, detailed memory towards not only general memory, but specific memories.

(Nakao et al., 2012) performed a study to show the relation between the self-reference effect and people that are highly in altruism and low in altruism.  This all starts with the medical prefrontal cortex (MPFC).  People who are high in altruism did not show the self-reference effect compared to the participants low in altruism.  The participants who frequently chose the altruistic behavior refer to the social desirability as a backboard (Nakoa et al., 2012).  The relation the self-reference effect and altruism is the MPFC.  When using the self-reference effect, people who are low in altruism, the same part of the brain is being used.  Whereas the same is for people who are high in altruism when using social desirability. Social desirability ties into the different types of memory enhancement can vary for individual differences of past experiences. People's individual differences can show similar effects as the self-reference effect (Nakoa et al., 2012).

The self-reference effect is a rich and powerful encoding process that can be used multiple ways.  The self-reference effect shows better results over the semantic method when processing personal information.  Processing personal information can be distinguished and recalled differently with age.  The older the subject, the more rich and vivid the memory can be due to the amount of information the brain has processed.  The self-reference just as effective as the SQR4 method when study for exams, but the self-reference method is preferred.  Defining general and specific memories using objects, verbal cues, etc. can be effective when using the self-reference effect.  When using these different method, the same part of the brain is being active resulting in relation and better recall. It was expected that participants would recall the most number of words from the self-referent list rather than from the semantic or structural lists and more words from the semantic list than from the structural list.  It was also expected that for the words encoded in the self-referent condition, fewer words would be recalled by participants in the high altruism group than in the low altruism group.

They found that women who believe they can control their weight ("internals"), respond most favorably to slim models in advertising, and this favorable response is mediated by self-referencing.&lt;ref name=Martin2007/&gt;

In [[topology]] and related branches of [[mathematics]], '''separated sets''' are pairs of [[subset]]s of a given [[topological space]] that are related to each other in a certain way: roughly speaking, neither overlapping nor touching.
The notion of when two sets are separated or not is important both to the notion of [[connected space]]s (and their connected components) as well as to the [[separation axiom]]s for topological spaces.

Separated sets should not be confused with [[separated space]]s (defined below), which are somewhat related but different.
[[Separable space]]s are again a completely different topological concept.

== Definitions ==

There are various ways in which two subsets of a topological space ''X'' can be considered to be separated.

*''A'' and ''B'' are '''disjoint''' if their [[intersection (set theory)|intersection]] is the [[empty set]]. This property has nothing to do with topology as such, but only [[naive set theory|set theory]]; it is included here because it is the weakest in the sequence of different notions. For more on disjointness in general, see: [[disjoint sets]].
*''A'' and ''B'' are '''separated''' in ''X'' if each is disjoint from the other's [[closure (topology)|closure]]. The closures themselves do not have to be disjoint from each other; for example, the [[interval (mathematics)|interval]]s [0,1) and (1,2] are separated in the [[real line]] '''R''', even though the point 1 belongs to both of their closures. More generally in any [[metric space]], two [[open balls]] ''B''&lt;sub&gt;''r''&lt;/sub&gt;(x&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) = {y:''d''(x&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,y)&lt;''r''} and   ''B''&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt;(x&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) = {y:''d''(x&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,y)&lt;''s''} are separated whenever ''d''(x&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,x&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) ≥ ''r''+''s''. Note that any two separated sets automatically must be disjoint.
*''A'' and ''B'' are '''separated by neighbourhoods''' if there are [[neighbourhood (topology)|neighbourhoods]] ''U'' of ''A'' and ''V'' of ''B'' such that ''U'' and ''V'' are disjoint. (Sometimes you will see the requirement that ''U'' and ''V'' be ''[[open (topology)|open]]'' neighbourhoods, but this makes no difference in the end.) For the example of ''A'' = [0,1) and ''B'' = (1,2], you could take ''U'' = (-1,1) and ''V'' = (1,3). Note that if any two sets are separated by neighbourhoods, then certainly they are separated. If ''A'' and ''B'' are open and disjoint, then they must be separated by neighbourhoods; just take ''U'' := ''A'' and ''V'' := ''B''. For this reason, separatedness is often used with closed sets (as in the [[normal separation axiom]]).
*''A'' and ''B'' are '''separated by closed neighbourhoods''' if there is a [[closed (topology)|closed]] neighbourhood ''U'' of ''A'' and a closed neighbourhood ''V'' of ''B'' such that ''U'' and ''V'' are disjoint. Our examples, [0,1) and (1,2], are ''not'' separated by closed neighbourhoods. You could make either ''U'' or ''V'' closed by including the point 1 in it, but you cannot make them both closed while keeping them disjoint. Note that if any two sets are separated by closed neighbourhoods, then certainly they are separated by neighbourhoods.
*''A'' and ''B'' are '''separated by a function''' if there exists a [[continuous function]] ''f'' from the space ''X'' to the real line '''R''' such that ''f''(''A'') = {0} and ''f''(''B'') = {1}. (Sometimes you will see the [[unit interval]] [0,1] used in place of '''R''' in this definition, but it makes no difference in the end.) In our example, [0,1) and (1,2] are not separated by a function, because there is no way to continuously define ''f'' at the point 1. Note that if any two sets are separated by a function, then they are also separated by closed neighbourhoods; the neighbourhoods can be given in terms of the [[preimage]] of ''f'' as ''U'' := ''f''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;[-''e'',''e''] and ''V'' := ''f''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;[1-''e'',1+''e''], as long as ''e'' is a [[positive number|positive real number]] less than [[half|1/2]].
*''A'' and ''B'' are '''precisely separated by a function''' if there exists a continuous function ''f'' from ''X'' to '''R''' such that ''f''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;(0) = ''A'' and ''f''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;(1) = ''B''. (Again, you may also see the unit interval in place of '''R''', and again it makes no difference.) Note that if any two sets are precisely separated by a function, then certainly they are separated by a function. Since {0} and {1} are closed in '''R''', only closed sets are capable of being precisely separated by a function; but just because two sets are closed and separated by a function does not mean that they are automatically precisely separated by a function (even a different function).

== Relation to separation axioms and separated spaces ==

The ''separation axioms'' are various conditions that are sometimes imposed upon topological spaces which can be described in terms of the various types of separated sets.
As an example, we will define the T&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; axiom, which is the condition imposed on separated spaces.
Specifically, a topological space is ''separated'' if, given any two [[Distinct (mathematics)|distinct]] points ''x'' and ''y'', the singleton sets {''x''} and {''y''} are separated by neighbourhoods.

Separated spaces are also called ''Hausdorff spaces'' or ''T&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; spaces''.
Further discussion of separated spaces may be found in the article [[Hausdorff space]].
General discussion of the various separation axioms is in the article [[Separation axiom]].

== Relation to connected spaces ==

Given a topological space ''X'', it is sometimes useful to consider whether it is possible for a subset ''A'' to be separated from its [[complement (set theory)|complement]].
This is certainly true if ''A'' is either the empty set or the entire space ''X'', but there may be other possibilities.
A topological space ''X'' is ''connected'' if these are the only two possibilities.
Conversely, if a nonempty subset ''A'' is separated from its own complement, and if the only [[subset]] of ''A'' to share this property is the empty set, then ''A'' is an ''open-connected component'' of ''X''.
(In the degenerate case where ''X'' is itself the [[empty set]] {}, authorities differ on whether {} is connected and whether {} is an open-connected component of itself.)

For more on connected spaces, see [[Connected space]].

== Relation to topologically distinguishable points ==

Given a topological space ''X'', two points ''x'' and ''y'' are ''topologically distinguishable'' if there exists an [[open set]] that one point belongs to but the other point does not.
If ''x'' and ''y'' are topologically distinguishable, then the [[singleton set]]s {''x''} and {''y''} must be disjoint.
On the other hand, if the singletons {''x''} and {''y''} are separated, then the points ''x'' and ''y'' must be topologically distinguishable.
Thus for singletons, topological distinguishability is a condition in between disjointness and separatedness.

For more about topologically distinguishable points, see [[Topological distinguishability]].

[[File:Ventromedial prefrontal cortex.png|thumb|right|Upright|Somatic markers are probably stored in the [[ventromedial prefrontal cortex]] (highlighted).]]
The '''somatic marker hypothesis''', formulated by Alice, proposes that [[emotion]]al processes guide (or bias) [[behavior]], particularly decision-making.&lt;ref name=Damasio94&gt;{{cite book |first=Antonio R. |last=Damasio |authorlink=Antonio Damasio |title=Descartes' Error: Emotion, Reason and the Human Brain |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MRY3hmYc1W8C |origyear=1994 |year=2008 |publisher=Random House |isbn=978-1-4070-7206-7 |ref=harv}} ''[[Descartes' Error]]''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DTD1991"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Damasio |first1=A.R. |last2=Tranel |first2=D. |last3=Damasio |first3=H.C. |chapter=Ch. 11: Somatic markers and the guidance of behaviour: theory and preliminary testing |editor1-first=Harvey S. |editor1-last=Levin |editor2-first=Howard M. |editor2-last=Eisenberg |editor3-first=Arthur Lester |editor3-last=Benton |title=Frontal Lobe Function and Dysfunction |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=9b1htO0V0rwC&amp;pg=PA217 |year=1991 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-506284-7 |pages=217–229}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Somatic markers" are feelings in the body that are associated with emotions, such as the association of rapid heartbeat with [[anxiety]] or of [[nausea]] with [[disgust]]. According to the hypothesis, somatic markers strongly influence subsequent decision-making. Within the brain, somatic markers are thought to be processed in the [[ventromedial prefrontal cortex|ventromedial]] [[prefrontal cortex]] (VMPFC) and the [[amygdala]]. The hypothesis has been tested in experiments using the [[Iowa gambling task]].

==Background==
In [[economics|economic theory]], human decision-making is often modeled as being devoid of emotions, involving only logical reasoning based on [[Cost–benefit analysis|cost-benefit calculations]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Loewenstein | first1 = G. F. | last2 = Weber | first2 = E. U. | last3 = Hsee | first3 = C. K. | last4 = Welch | first4 = N. |title=Risk as feelings |journal=Psychol Bull |volume=127 |issue=2 |pages=267–86 |date=March 2001 |pmid=11316014 |url=http://content.apa.org/journals/bul/127/2/267 |doi=10.1037/0033-2909.127.2.267 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, the somatic marker hypothesis proposes that emotions play a critical role in the ability to make fast, rational decisions in complex and uncertain situations.&lt;ref name=Damasio94/&gt;

Patients with frontal lobe damage, such as [[Phineas Gage]], provided the first evidence that the frontal lobes were associated with decision-making. Frontal lobe damage, particularly to the [[Ventromedial prefrontal cortex]] (vmPFC), results in impaired abilities to organize and plan behavior and learn from previous mistakes, without affecting intellect in terms of [[working memory]], [[attention]], and [[Sentence processing|language comprehension and expression]].&lt;ref name=Damasio1991&gt;{{cite book|last=Damasio|first=A.|title=Somatic Markers and the Guidance of Behavior|year=1991|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|pages=217–299}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Tranel1994&gt;{{cite journal | last = Tranel | first = D. |title="Acquired sociopathy": the development of sociopathic behavior following focal brain damage |journal=Prog Exp Pers Psychopathol Res |volume= |issue= |pages=285–311 |date=1994 |pmid=8044207 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

vmPFC patients also have difficulty expressing and experiencing appropriate emotions. This led Antonio Damasio to hypothesize that decision-making deficits following vmPFC damage result from the inability to use emotions to help guide future behavior based on past experiences. Consequently, vmPFC damage forces those afflicted to rely on slow and laborious cost-benefit analyses for every given choice situation.&lt;ref name=Bechara2005&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bechara|first=A.|last2=Damasio |first2=A.R.|title=The somatic marker hypothesis: A neural theory of economic decision|journal=Games and Economic Behavior|year=2005|volume=52|pages=336–372|doi=10.1016/j.geb.2004.06.010|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hypothesis==
When individuals [[decision-making|make decisions]], they must assess the [[incentive]] value of the choices available to them, using [[cognitive]] and emotional processes. When the individuals face complex and conflicting choices, they may be unable to decide using only cognitive processes, which may become overloaded. Emotions, consequently, are hypothesized to guide decision-making.

Emotions, as defined by Damasio, are changes in both body and brain states in response to stimuli.&lt;ref name=Damasio94/&gt; Physiological changes (such as [[muscle tone]], [[heart rate]], [[endocrine system|endocrine activity]], [[posture (psychology)|posture]], [[facial expression]], and so forth) occur in the body and are relayed to the brain where they are transformed into an emotion that tells the individual something about the stimulus that they have encountered. Over time, emotions and their corresponding bodily changes, which are called "somatic markers", become associated with particular situations and their past outcomes.

When making subsequent decisions, these somatic markers and their evoked emotions are consciously or unconsciously associated with their past outcomes, and influence decision-making in favor of some behaviors instead of others.&lt;ref name=Damasio94/&gt; For instance, when a somatic marker associated with a positive outcome is perceived, the person may feel happy and thereby motivated to pursue that behavior. When a somatic marker associated with the negative outcome is perceived, the person may feel sad, which acts as an internal alarm to warn the individual to avoid that course of action. These situation-specific somatic states based on, and reinforced by, past experiences help to guide behavior in favor of more advantageous choices, and therefore are adaptive.

According to the hypothesis, two distinct pathways reactivate somatic marker responses. In the first pathway, emotion can be evoked by changes in the body that are projected to the brain – called the "body loop". For instance, encountering a feared object like a snake may initiate the [[fight-or-flight]] response and cause fear. In the second pathway, cognitive representations of the emotions (imagining an unpleasant situation "as-if" you were in that particular situation) can be activated in the brain without being directly elicited by a sensory stimulus – called the "[[as-if body loop]]". Thus, the brain can anticipate expected bodily changes, which allows the individual to respond faster to external stimuli without waiting for an event to actually occur.&lt;ref name=Damasio1991 /&gt; The amygdala and VMPFC (a subsection of the orbitomedial prefrontal cortex or OMPFC) are essential components of this hypothesized mechanism, and therefore damage to either structure will disrupt decision-making.

==Experimental evidence==
{{Main article|Iowa gambling task}}
In an effort to produce a simple [[neuropsychology|neuropsychological]] tool that would assess deficits in emotional processing, decision-making, and [[social skills]] of OMPFC-[[lesion]]ed individuals, Bechara and collaborators created the [[Iowa gambling task]].&lt;ref name="DTD1991"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bechara1994"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bechara | first1 = A. | first2 = A. R. |last2=Damasio | first3 = H. |last3=Damasio | first4 = S. W. |last4=Anderson |title=Insensitivity to future consequences following damage to human prefrontal cortex |journal=Cognition |volume=50 |issue=1–3 |pages=7–15 |date=1994 |pmid=8039375 |doi=10.1016/0010-0277(94)90018-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The task measures a form of emotion-based learning. Studies using the gambling task have found deficits in various neurological (such as [[amygdala]] and OMPFC lesions) and psychiatric populations (such as [[schizophrenia]], [[mania]], and [[drug abuse]]rs).

The Iowa gambling task is a computerized test in which participants are presented with four decks of cards from which they repeatedly choose. Each deck contains various amounts of rewards of either $50 or $100, and occasional losses that are greater in the decks with higher rewards. The participants do not know where the penalty cards are located, and are told to pick cards that will maximize their winnings. The most profitable strategy turns out to be to choose cards only from the small reward/small penalty decks, because although the reward is smaller, the penalty is proportionally much smaller than in the high reward/high penalty decks. Over the course of a session, most healthy participants come to adopt the profitable low-penalty deck strategy. Participants with brain damage, however, are unable to determine the better deck to choose from, and continue to choose from the high reward/high penalty decks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Dezfouli | first1 = A. K. | last2 = Keramati | first2 = M. M. | last3 = Ekhtiari | first3 = H. | last4 = Safaei | first4 = H. | last5 = Lucas | first5 = C. |chapter=Understanding Addictive Behavior on the Iowa gambling task Using Reinforcement Learning Framework |chapterurl=http://amir.dezfouli.com/pubs/dkesl_cogsci_2008.pdf |title=Proceedings of the 30th Annual Conference of the Cognitive Science Society |date=2008 |pages=1094–9 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the Iowa gambling task measures participants' quickness in "developing anticipatory emotional responses to guide advantageous choices",&lt;ref name="Wardle 2010"/&gt; it is helpful in testing the somatic marker hypothesis. According to the hypothesis, somatic markers give rise to anticipation of the emotional consequences of a decision being made. Consequently, persons who perform well on the task are thought to be aware of the penalty cards and of the negative emotions associated with drawing such cards, and to realize which deck is less likely to yield a penalty.&lt;ref name="Wardle 2010"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wardle | first1 = M. C. | last2 = Gonzalez | first2 = R. | last3 = Bechara | first3 = A. | last4 = Martin-Thormeyer | first4 = E. M. |title=Iowa gambling task performance and emotional distress interact to predict risky sexual behavior in individuals with dual substance and HIV diagnoses |journal=J Clin Exp Neuropsychol |volume=32 |issue=10 |pages=1110–21 |date=December 2010 |pmid=20480423 |pmc=3639122 |doi=10.1080/13803391003757833 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This experiment has been used to analyze the impairments suffered by people with damage to the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, which has been known to affect neural signaling of prospective rewards or punishments. Such persons perform less well on the task.&lt;ref name=Damasio94/&gt; [[Functional magnetic resonance imaging]] (fMRI) has been used to analyze the brain during the Iowa gambling task. The brain regions that were activated during the Iowa gambling task were also the ones hypothesized to be triggered by somatic markers during decision-making.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Li | first1 = X. | last2 = Lu | first2 = Z. L. | last3 = D'Argembeau | first3 = A. | last4 = Ng | first4 = M. | last5 = Bechara | first5 = A. |title=The Iowa gambling task in fMRI images |journal=Hum Brain Mapp |volume=31 |issue=3 |pages=410–23 |date=March 2010 |pmid=19777556 |pmc=2826566 |doi=10.1002/hbm.20875 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evolutionary significance==
Damasio has posited that the ability of humans to perform abstract thinking quickly and efficiently coincides with both the development of the ventromedial (VM) cortex and with the use of somatic markers to guide human behavior during evolution.&lt;ref name=Bechara2005 /&gt; Patients with damage to the VM cortices are more likely to engage in behaviors that negatively impact personal relationships in the distant future, but they never engage in actions that would lead to immediate harm to themselves or others.&lt;ref name=Damasio94/&gt; The evolution of the prefrontal cortex was associated with the ability to represent events that may occur in the future.&lt;ref name=Bechara2005 /&gt;

==Application to risky behavior==
The somatic marker hypothesis has been applied to trying to understand risky behaviors, such as [[risky sexual behavior]] and drug addiction.

According to the hypothesis, riskier sexual behaviors are more exhilarating and pleasurable, and therefore they are more likely to stimulate repetitive engagement in such behaviors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Zuckerman | first1 = M. | last2 = Kuhlman | first2 = D. M. |title=Personality and risk-taking: common biosocial factors |journal=J Pers |volume=68 |issue=6 |pages=999–1029 |date=December 2000 |pmid=11130742 |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/openurl?genre=article&amp;sid=nlm:pubmed&amp;issn=0022-3506&amp;date=2000&amp;volume=68&amp;issue=6&amp;spage=999 |doi=10.1111/1467-6494.00124 }}&lt;/ref&gt; When this idea was tested in individuals who were infected with [[HIV]] and were [[Substance dependence|substance dependent]], differences were found between persons who scored well in the Iowa gambling test, and those who scored poorly. The high scorers showed a correlation between the amount of distress they reported having over their HIV status, and their acceptance of risk during sexual behavior – the greater the distress, the greater the risk that these people would take. The low scorers, on the other hand, showed no such correlation. These results were interpreted as indicating that persons with intact decision-making abilities are better able to rely on past emotional experiences when weighing risks, than are persons who are deficient in such abilities, and that acceptance of risk serves to ameliorate emotional distress.&lt;ref name="Wardle 2010"/&gt;

Drug abusers are thought to ignore the negative consequences of addiction while seeking drugs. According to the somatic marker hypothesis, such abusers are impaired in their ability to recall and consider past unpleasant experiences when weighing whether to consider drug seeking behaviors.&lt;ref name="Bechara, A. 2003"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Bechara | first = A. |title=Risky business: emotion, decision-making, and addiction |journal=J Gambl Stud |volume=19 |issue=1 |pages=23–51 | date = 2003 |pmid=12635539 |doi=10.1023/A:1021223113233 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Verdejo-Garcia A 2006"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Verdejo-García | first1 = A. | last2 = Bechara | first2 = A. | last3 = Recknor | first3 = E. C. | last4 = Pérez-García | first4 = M. |title=Executive dysfunction in substance dependent individuals during drug use and abstinence: an examination of the behavioral, cognitive and emotional correlates of addiction |journal=J Int Neuropsychol Soc |volume=12 |issue=3 |pages=405–15 |date=May 2006 |pmid=16903133 |doi=10.1017/S1355617706060486 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers analyzed the [[Neuroendocrinology|neuroendocrine]] responses of substance-dependent individuals and healthy individuals after being shown pleasant or unpleasant images. In response to unpleasant images, drug users showed decreased levels of several neuroendocrine markers, including [[norepinephrine]], [[cortisol]], and [[adrenocorticotropic hormone]]. Addicts showed lesser responses to both pleasant and unpleasant images, suggesting that they may have a diminished emotional response.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gerra | first1 = G. | last2 = Baldaro | first2 = B. | last3 = Zaimovic | first3 = A. |title=Neuroendocrine responses to experimentally-induced emotions among abstinent opioid-dependent subjects |journal=Drug Alcohol Depend |volume=71 |issue=1 |pages=25–35 |date=July 2003 |pmid=12821203 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0376871603000656 |doi=10.1016/S0376-8716(03)00065-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Neuroimaging]] studies utilizing fMRI indicate that drug-related stimuli have the ability to activate brain regions involved in emotional evaluation and reward processing. When shown a film of people smoking [[cocaine]], cocaine users showed greater activation of the [[anterior cingulate cortex]], the right inferior [[parietal lobe]], and the [[caudate nucleus]] than did non-users. Conversely, the cocaine users showed lesser activation when viewing a sex film than did non-users.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Garavan | first1 = H. | last2 = Pankiewicz | first2 = J. | last3 = Bloom | first3 = A. |title=Cue-induced cocaine craving: neuroanatomical specificity for drug users and drug stimuli |journal=Am J Psychiatry |volume=157 |issue=11 |pages=1789–98 |date=November 2000 |pmid=11058476 |url=http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/article.aspx?volume=157&amp;page=1789 |doi=10.1176/appi.ajp.157.11.1789 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
{{expand section|date=June 2015}}
{{see also|Reward system}}
Some researchers believe that the use of somatic markers (i.e., [[afferent nerve|afferent feedback]]) would be a very inefficient method of influencing behavior. Damasio's notion of the ''as-if'' experience dependent feedback route,&lt;ref name=Damasio94/&gt;&lt;ref name="Damasio1999"&gt;{{cite book |first=Antonio R. |last=Damasio |title=The Feeling of what Happens: Body, Emotion and the Making of Consciousness |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=usiJxdb897YC |year=2000 |publisher=Vintage |isbn=978-0-09-928876-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; whereby bodily responses are re-represented utilizing the somatosensory cortex ([[postcentral gyrus]]), also proposes an inefficient method of affecting explicit behavior.&lt;ref name="Rolls1999"&gt;{{cite book |last=Rolls |first=E.T. |title=The brain and emotion |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford | date = 1999 |isbn=978-0-19-852464-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Rolls (1999) stated that; "it would be very inefficient and noisy to place in the execution route a peripheral response, and transducers to attempt to measure that peripheral response, itself a notoriously difficult procedure" (p.&amp;nbsp;73).&lt;ref name="Rolls1999"/&gt; Reinforcement association located in the orbitofrontal cortex and amygdala, where the incentive value of stimuli is decoded, is sufficient to elicit emotion-based learning and to affect behavior via, for example, the orbitofrontal-striatal pathway.&lt;ref name="Rolls1999"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Rolls1997"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Rolls | first = E. T. |title=Consciousness in Neural Networks? |journal=Neural Netw |volume=10 |issue=7 |pages=1227–40 |date=October 1997 |pmid=12662513 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0893-6080(97)00049-X |doi=10.1016/S0893-6080(97)00049-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; This process can occur via implicit or explicit processes.&lt;ref name="Rolls1999"/&gt;

The somatic marker hypothesis represents a model of how feedback from the body may contribute to both advantageous and disadvantageous decision-making in situations of complexity and uncertainty. Much of its supporting data comes from data taken from the Iowa gambling task.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bechara | first1 = A. | last2 = Tranel | first2 = D. | last3 = Damasio | first3 = H. | last4 = Damasio | first4 = A. R. |title=Failure to respond autonomically to anticipated future outcomes following damage to prefrontal cortex |journal=Cereb.

First, the claim that it assesses implicit learning as the reward/punishment design is inconsistent with data showing accurate knowledge of the task possibilities&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Maia | first1 = T. V. | last2 = McClelland | first2 = J. L. |title=A reexamination of the evidence for the somatic marker hypothesis: what participants really know in the Iowa gambling task |journal=Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. |volume=101 |issue=45 |pages=16075–80 |date=November 2004 |pmid=15501919 |pmc=528759 |doi=10.1073/pnas.0406666101 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and that mechanisms such as working-memory appear to have a strong influence. Second, the claim that this knowledge occurs through preventive marker signals is not supported by competing explanations of the psychophysiology generated profile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Tomb | first1 = I. | last2 = Hauser | first2 = M. | last3 = Deldin | first3 = P. | last4 = Caramazza | first4 = A. |title=Do somatic markers mediate decisions on the gambling task? |journal=Nat. Neurosci. |volume=5 |issue=11 |pages=1103–4; author reply 1104 |date=November 2002 |pmid=12403997 |doi=10.1038/nn1102-1103 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Lastly, the claim that the impairment is due to a 'myopia for the future' is undermined by more plausible psychological mechanisms explaining deficits on the tasks such as reversal learning, risk-taking, and working-memory deficits. There may also be more variability in control performance than previously thought, thus complicating the interpretation of the findings. 

Furthermore, although the somatic marker hypothesis has accurately identified many of the brain regions involved in decision-making, emotion, and body-state representation, it has failed to clearly demonstrate how these processes interact at a psychological and evolutionary level. There are many experiments that could be implemented to further test the somatic marker hypothesis. One way would be to develop variants of the Iowa gambling task that control some of the methodological issues and interpretation ambiguities generated. It may be a good idea to include removing the reversal learning confound, which would make the task more difficult to consciously comprehend. Additionally, causal tests of the somatic marker hypothesis could be practiced more insistently in a greater range of populations with altered peripheral feedback, like on patients with facial paralysis. 

In conclusion, the somatic marker hypothesis needs to be tested in more experiments. Until a wider range of empirical approaches are employed in order to test the somatic marker hypothesis, it appears that the framework is simply an intriguing idea that is in need of some better supporting evidence. Despite these issues, the somatic marker hypothesis and the Iowa gambling task reestablish the notion that emotion has the potential to be a benefit as well as a problem during the decision-making process in humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Dunn | first1 = B.

[[File:Comic balloons 4 types 1x4.svg|thumb|The four most common speech balloons, top to bottom: speech, whisper, thought, scream.]]

'''Speech balloons''' (also '''speech bubbles''', '''dialogue balloons''' or '''word balloons''') are a graphic convention used most commonly in [[comic book]]s, [[comic]]s and [[cartoon]]s to allow words (and much less often, pictures) to be understood as representing the speech or thoughts of a given character in the comic. There is often a formal distinction between the balloon that indicates thoughts and the one that indicates words spoken aloud: the balloon that conveys thoughts is often referred to as a '''thought bubble'''.

==History==

One of the earliest antecedents to the modern speech bubble were the "[[speech scroll]]s", wispy lines that connected first person speech to the mouths of the speakers in [[Mesoamerican]] art between 600 and 900 AD.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite paper| author=Hull, Kerry Michael| title=Verbal Art and Performance in Ch’orti’ and Maya Hieroglyphic Writing| year=2003| url=http://www.lib.utexas.edu/etd/d/2003/hullkm039/hullkm039.pdf| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061012021647/http://www.lib.utexas.edu/etd/d/2003/hullkm039/hullkm039.pdf| archivedate=2006-10-12| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Western graphic art, labels that reveal what a pictured figure is saying have appeared since at least the 13th century. These were in common European use by the early 16th century. Word balloons (also known as "banderoles") began appearing in 18th-century printed broadsides, and political cartoons from the [[American Revolution]] (including some published by [[Benjamin Franklin]]) often used them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nhc.rtp.nc.us/tserve/eighteen/ekeyinfo/erelrev.htm|title=Religion and the American Revolution, Divining America, TeacherServe®, National Humanities Center|work=rtp.nc.us}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[http://xroads.virginia.edu/~MA04/wood/ykid/illustrated.htm The Yellow Kid on paper and stage, Contemporary illustrations]''. Retrieved October 17, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; They later fell out of fashion, but by 1904 had regained their popularity, although they were still considered novel enough to require explanation.&lt;ref name=ArtOfCaricature&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/artofcaricature00wrig#page/134/mode/2up/ The Art of Caricature], p. 134, by Grant Wright; published September 1904, by Baker &amp; Taylor Publishing&lt;/ref&gt; With the development of the [[comics]] industry in the 20th century, the appearance of speech balloons has become increasingly standardized, though the formal conventions that have evolved in different cultures (USA as opposed to Japan, for example), can be quite distinct.

[[Richard F. Outcault]]'s [[Yellow Kid]] is generally credited as the first American comic strip character. His words initially appeared on his yellow shirt, but word balloons very much like those in use today were added almost immediately, as early as 1896. By the start of the 20th century, word balloons were ubiquitous, and since that time only a very few American comic strips and comic books have relied on captions, notably [[Hal Foster]]'s ''[[Prince Valiant]]'' and the early [[Tarzan (comics)|''Tarzan'' comic strip]] in the 1930s. In Europe, where [[text comics]] were more common, speech balloons slowly caught on with well known examples like [[Alain Saint-Ogan]]'s ''[[Zig et Puce]]'' (1925), [[Hergé]]'s ''[[The Adventures of Tintin]]'' (1929)  and [[Rob-Vel]]'s ''[[Spirou (comics)|Spirou]]'' (1938).

==Popular forms==

===Speech bubbles===
The most common is the speech bubble. It comes in two forms for two circumstances: an in-panel character and an off-panel character. An in-panel character (one who is fully or mostly visible in the panel of the strip of comic that the reader is viewing) uses a bubble with a pointer, called a tail, directed towards the speaker.

When one character has multiple balloons within a panel, often only the balloon nearest to the speaker's head has a tail, and the others are connected to it in sequence by narrow bands. This style is often used in [[Mad Magazine]], due to its "[[call-and-response]]" dialogue-based humor.

An off-panel character (the comic book equivalent of being "off screen") has several options, some of them rather unconventional. The first is a standard speech bubble with a tail pointing toward the speaker's position. The second option, which originated in [[manga]], has the tail pointing ''into'' the bubble, instead of out. (This tail is still pointing towards the speaker.) The third option replaces the tail with a sort of bottleneck that connects with the side of the panel. It can be seen in the works of [[Marjane Satrapi]] (author of ''[[Persepolis (graphic novel)|Persepolis]]'').

In American &lt;!--- Is the description American necessary? Isn't this technique also used in manga, etc? ---&gt; comics, a bubble without a tail means that the speaker is not merely outside the reader's field of view but invisible to the [[point of view (literature)|viewpoint character]], often as an unspecified member of a crowd.

Characters distant (in space or time) from the scene of the panel can still speak, in squared bubbles without a tail; this usage, equivalent to [[voice-over]] in film, is not uncommon in American comics for dramatic contrast.  In contrast to captions, the corners of such balloons never coincide with those of the panel; for further distinction they often have a double outline, a different background color, or [[quotation mark]]s.

===Thought bubbles===
Thought bubbles come in two forms: the chain thought bubble and the "fuzzy" bubble.

The chain thought bubble is the almost universal symbol for thinking in cartoons. It consists of a large, [[cloud]]-like bubble containing the text of the thought, with a chain of increasingly smaller circular bubbles leading to the character. Some artists use an elliptical bubble instead of a cloud-shaped one.

Often animal characters like [[Snoopy]] and [[Garfield (character)|Garfield]] "talk" using thought bubbles.  Thought bubbles may also be used in circumstances when a character is gagged or otherwise unable to speak.

Another, less conventional thought bubble has emerged: the "fuzzy" thought bubble. Used in manga (by such artists as [[Ken Akamatsu]]), the fuzzy bubble is roughly circular in shape (generally), but the edge of the bubble is not a line but a collection of spikes close to each other, creating the impression of fuzziness. Fuzzy thought bubbles do not use tails, and are placed near the character who is thinking. This has the advantage of reflecting the TV equivalent effect: something said with an echo.

Writers and artists can refuse to use thought bubbles, expressing the action through spoken dialogue and drawing; they are sometimes seen as an inefficient method of expressing thought because they are attached directly to the head of the thinker, unlike methods such as caption boxes, which can be used both as an expression of thought and narration while existing in an entirely different panel from the character thinking. However, they are restricted to the current viewpoint character. An example is [[Alan Moore]] and [[David Lloyd (comic artist)|David Lloyd]]'s ''[[V for Vendetta]]'', wherein during one chapter, a monologue expressed in captions serves not only to express the thoughts of a character but also the mood, status and actions of three others.

===Other forms===
The shape of a speech balloon can be used to convey further information. Common ones include the following:
*''Scream bubbles'' indicate a character is screaming or shouting, usually with a jagged outline or a thicker line which can be colored.  Their lettering is usually larger or bolder than normal.
*''Broadcast bubbles'' (also known as ''radio bubbles'') may have a jagged tail like the conventional drawing of a lightning flash and either a squared-off or jagged outline. Letters are sometimes italicised without also being bold. Broadcast bubbles indicate that the speaker is communicating through an electronic device, such as a radio or television, or is robotic.
*''Whisper bubbles'' are usually drawn with a dashed (dotted) outline, smaller font or gray lettering to indicate the tone is softer, as most speech is printed in black. &lt;BR&gt;Another form, sometimes encountered in manga, looks like an occidental thought bubble.
*''Icicle bubbles'' have jagged "icicles" on the lower edge, representing "cold" hostility.  
*''Monster bubbles'' have blood or slime dripping from them.
*''Colored bubbles'' can be used to convey the emotion that goes with the speech, such as red for anger or green for envy. This style is seldom used in modern comics. Alternatively (especially in online-published comics), colours can be used to provide an additional cue about who is speaking. Main characters often have individual thematic colours, and their speech bubbles are frequently tinted with their colour; especially in situations when there are no characters visible for speech bubbles to point to.

==Captions==
Captions are generally used for [[narration]] purposes, such as showing location and time, or conveying editorial commentary. They are generally rectangular and positioned near the edge of the panel. Often they are also colored to indicate the difference between themselves and the word balloons used by the characters, which are almost always white. Increasingly in modern comics, captions are frequently used to convey an internal monologue or typical speech.&lt;ref name=Piekos&gt;Piekos, Nate. [http://www.blambot.com/articles_grammar.shtml "Comic Book Grammar &amp; Tradition" (Updated 2015)], Blambot website. Accessed Jan. 8, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Artist-specific variations==
[[Image:YellowKid.jpeg|thumb|left|[[Yellow Kid]]'s words appear on his shirt]]

Some characters and strips use highly unconventional methods of communication. Perhaps the most notable is the [[Yellow Kid]], an early [[United States|American]] [[comic strip]]. His (but not the other characters') words would appear on his large, smock-like shirt. A short-run [[Shirt Tales#TV series|American animated TV series of the early 1980s]] used this same concept, but with changing phrases on the "T-shirts" worn by the animal-based characters, depending on the characters' thoughts. 

Also noteworthy are the many variations on the form created by [[Dave Sim]] for his comic ''[[Cerebus the Aardvark]]''. Depending on the shape, size, and position of the bubble, as well as the texture and shape of the letters within it, Sim could convey large amounts of information about the speaker. This included separate bubbles for different states of mind (drunkenness, etc.), for echoes, and a special class of bubbles for one single floating apparition.

An early pioneer in experimenting with many different types of speech balloons and lettering for different types of speech was [[Walt Kelly]], in his ''[[Pogo (comics)|Pogo]]'' strip. Deacon Mushrat speaks in [[blackletter]], P.T. Bridgeport speaks in circus posters, Sarcophagus MacAbre speaks in condolence cards, "Mr. Pig" (a take on [[Nikita Khrushchev]]) speaks in [[faux Cyrillic]], etc.

In the famous French comic series ''[[Asterix]]'', [[René Goscinny|Goscinny]] and [[Albert Uderzo|Uderzo]] use bubbles without tails to indicate a distant or unseen speaker. They have also experimented with using different types of lettering for characters of different nationalities to indicate they speak a different language that Asterix may not understand; Goths speak in [[blackletter]], Greeks in angular lettering (though always understood by the Gaulish main characters, so it is more of an accent than a language), Norse with "Nørdic åccents", Egyptians in faux [[Egyptian hieroglyphs|hieroglyphs]] (depictive illustrations and rebuses), etc. Another experiment with speech bubbles was exclusive to one book, ''[[Asterix and the Roman Agent]]''. The agent in question is a vile manipulator who creates discord in a group of people with a single innocent-sounding comment. His victims start quarreling and ultimately fighting each other while speaking in green-colored speech bubbles.

Font variation is a common tactic in comics. ''[[The Sandman (Vertigo)|The Sandman]]'' series, written by [[Neil Gaiman]] and [[Letterer|lettered]] by [[Todd Klein]], features many characters whose speech bubbles are written with a font that is exclusive to them. For examples, the main character, the gloomy [[Dream (DC Comics)|Dream]], speaks in wavy-edged bubbles, completely black, with similarly wavy white lettering. His sister, the scatterbrained and whimsical [[Delirium (DC Comics)|Delirium]] speaks in bubbles in a many-colored explosive background with uneven lettering, and the irreverent raven [[Characters of The Sandman#Matthew|Matthew]] speaks in a shaky angular kind of bubble with scratchy lettering. Other characters, such as John Dee, have special shapes of bubbles for their own.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2013/01/07/comics-you-should-own-sandman/|title= Comics You Should Own – ''Sandman''|first= Greg|last= Burgas|date= January 7, 2013|publisher= [[Comic Book Resources]]|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20140410022316/http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2013/01/07/comics-you-should-own-sandman/|archivedate= April 10, 2014|deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[Mad (magazine)|Mad]]'''s recurring ''[[Monroe (comic strip)|Monroe]]'' comic strip, certain words are written larger or in unusual fonts for emphasis.

In [[manga]], there is a tendency to include the speech necessary for the storyline in balloons, while small scribbles outside the balloons add side comments, often used for irony or to show that they're said in a much smaller voice.  [[Characters of Negima (16-31)#Satsuki Yotsuba|Satsuki Yotsuba]] in the manga series [[Negima]] is notable because she speaks almost ''entirely'' in side scribble.

==Graphic symbols==
{{unreferenced section|date=July 2016}}
Speech bubbles are used not only to include a character's words, but also emotions, voice inflections and unspecified language.

===Punctuation marks===
One of the universal emblems of the art of comics is the use of a single punctuation mark to depict a character's emotions, much more efficiently than any possible sentence. A speech bubble with a single big [[question mark]] (?) (often drawn by hand, not counted as part of the lettering) denotes confusion or ignorance. An [[exclamation mark]] (!) indicates surprise or terror. This device is broadly used in the European comic tradition, the Belgian artist [[Hergé]]'s ''[[The Adventures of Tintin]]'' series being a good example. Sometimes, the punctuation marks stand alone above the character's head, with no bubble needed.

In [[manga]], the [[ellipsis]] (i.e. three dots) is also used to express silence in a much more significant way than the mere absence of bubbles. This is specially seen when a character is supposed to say something, to indicate a stunned silence or when a sarcastic comment is expected by the reader. The ellipsis, along with the big drop of sweat on the character's temple—usually depicting shame, confusion, or embarrassment caused by other people's actions—is one of the [[Japan]]ese graphic symbols that have taken root in comics all around the world, although they are still rare in Western tradition.  Japanese even has a sound effect for "deafening silence", {{nihongo|''shiin''|シーン|}}.

===Foreign languages===
In many comic books, words that would be foreign to the narration but are displayed in translation for the reader are surrounded by [[Brackets|angle brackets]] or chevrons {{angbr|like this}}.

[[Gilbert Hernandez]]'s series about [[Love and Rockets (comics)|Palomar]] is written in English, but supposed to take place mainly in a [[Hispanic]] country. Thus, what's supposed to be representations of [[Spanish language|Spanish]] speech is written without brackets, but occasional actual English speech is written within brackets, to indicate that it is unintelligible to the main [[Hispanophone]] characters in the series.

Some comics will have the actual foreign language in the speech balloon, with the translation as a footnote; this is done with Latin aphorisms in ''Asterix''.

Another convention is to put the foreign speech in a distinctive lettering style; for example, [[Asterix and the Goths|''Asterix''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s Goths]] speak in [[blackletter]].

Since the Japanese language uses [[Horizontal and vertical writing in East Asian scripts|two writing directionalities]] (vertical, which is the traditional direction; and horizontal, as most other languages), manga has a convention of representing translated foreign speech as horizontal text.

===The big Z===
It is a convention in [[United States|American]] comics that the sound of a snore is represented as a series of Z's, dating back at least to [[Rudolph Dirks]]' early 20th-century strip ''[[The Katzenjammer Kids]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Adams, Cecil. [http://www.washingtoncitypaper.com/articles/42997/why-does-z-stand-for-snoring-and-how-do-other/ "The Straight Dope: Why Does Z Stand for Snoring? And how do other languages represent the sound?,"] ''Washington City Paper'' (July 27, 2012).&lt;/ref&gt; This practice has even been reduced to a single letter Z, so that a speech bubble with this letter standing all alone (again, drawn by hand rather than a font type) means the character is sleeping in most humorous comics. This can be seen, for instance, in [[Charles Schulz]]'s ''[[Peanuts]]'' comic strips.

Originally, the resemblance between the 'z' sound and that of a snore seemed exclusive to the [[English language]], but the spread of American comics has made it a frequent feature in other countries.  An exception to this is in Japanese manga, where the usual symbol for sleep is a large bubble coming out of the character's nose.&lt;ref&gt;Logan, Megan. [https://www.wired.com/2015/05/using-emoji-wrong/ "WE’RE ALL USING THESE EMOJI WRONG,"] ''Wired'' (05.21.15).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Drawings within the speech bubble===
Singing characters usually have [[musical note]]s drawn into their word balloons. [[Archie Comics]]' [[Melody Valentine]], a character in their ''[[Josie and the Pussycats (comic)|Josie and the Pussycats]]'' comic, has musical notes drawn into her word balloons at all times, to convey that she speaks in a sing-song voice.

The above-mentioned Albert Uderzo in the ''Asterix'' series decorates speech bubbles with beautiful flowers depicting an extremely soft, sweet voice (usually  preceding a violent outburst by the same character).

A stormy cloud with a rough lightning sticking out of it, either in a bubble or just floating above the character's head as a modified 'cloudy' thought bubble, depicts anger, not always verbally expressed.

[[Light bulbs]] are sometimes used when the character comes up with an idea or solution to a problem.

In the Western world, it is common to replace profanity with a string of nonsense symbols (&amp;%$@*$#), sometimes called [[The Lexicon of Comicana|grawlixes]]. In comics that are usually addressed to children or teenagers, bad language is [[censorship|censored]] by replacing it with more or less elaborate drawings and expressionistic symbols. For example, instead of calling someone a swine, a pig is drawn in the speech bubble.

One example is the [[Spain|Spanish]] ''[[Mortadelo]]'' series, created by [[Francisco Ibáñez Talavera|Francisco Ibáñez]]. Although not specifically addressed to children, ''Mortadelo'' was born during [[Francisco Franco]]'s [[dictatorship]], when censorship was the order of the day and the slightest attempt of rough language was prohibited. When Ibáñez's characters are angry, donkey heads, lightning, lavatories, billy goats and even faux Japanese characters are often seen in their bubbles.

When ''Mortadelo'' was portrayed on film by Spanish director [[Javier Fesser]] in 2003, one of the critiques made to his otherwise successful adaptation was the character's use of words that never appeared in the comics. Fesser claimed: "When you see a bubble speech containing a lightning falling on a pig, what do you imagine the character's saying?"

==Order==
In order for comic strip and graphic novel dialogue to make sense, it has to be read in order. Thus, conventions have evolved in the order in which the communication bubbles are read. The individual bubbles are read in the order of the language. For example, in [[English language|English]], the bubbles are read from left to right in a panel, while in [[Japanese language|Japanese]], it is the other way around. Sometimes the bubbles are "stacked", with two characters having multiple bubbles, one above the other. Such stacks are read from the top down. Poor use of speech balloons can unintentionally make the proper reading order ambiguous, confusing the reader.

==Lettering==
Traditionally, a cartoonist or occupational [[letterer]] would draw in all the individual letters in the balloons and sound effects by hand.  A modern alternative, used by most comics today and universal in English-translated manga, is to letter with computer programs.  The [[font]]s used usually emulate the style of hand-lettering.

Traditionally, most mainstream comic books are lettered entirely in [[upper-case]], with a few exceptions:
* Name particles such as ''de'' and ''von'', and the "c" in a [[surname]] of Scottish or Irish origin starting with ''Mc''
* To indicate a frightened or quiet manner of speech
* An interjection such as "er", "um", etc.

When hand-lettering, upper-case lettering saves time and effort because it requires drawing only three guidelines, while mixed-case lettering requires five.&lt;ref name=Bradley&gt;Bradley, Drew. [http://multiversitycomics.com/columns/looking-at-lettering-caps-vs-mixed-case/ "Looking at Lettering: CAPS vs Mixed Case,"] ''Multiversity Comics'' (April 22, 2014).&lt;/ref&gt;

In a few comics, uppercase and lowercase are used as in ordinary writing.  Since the mid-1980s, [[mixed case]] lettering has gradually become more widely used in mainstream books. Some comics, such as ''[[Pearls Before Swine (comics)|Pearls Before Swine]]'', also use lowercase speech to mark a distinctive accent (in this case, the male crocodiles’ accented speech, opposed to all other characters who use standard uppercase speech).

From 2002–2004, [[Marvel Comics]] experimented with mixed-case lettering in all its books.&lt;ref name=Bradley /&gt; Most mainstream titles have since returned to traditional all upper-case lettering.

In many comics, although the lettering is entirely in capital letters, [[serif]] versions of "I" are used exclusively where a capital I would appear in normal print text, and a [[sanserif]] (i.e., a simple vertical line) is used in all other places. This reduces confusion with the number one, and also serves to indicate when the personal pronoun "I" is meant. This lettering convention can be seen in computer fonts such as [[Blambot]]'s "DigitalStrip.ttf" and "AnimeAce.ttf" fonts, which make no other distinction between lower- and uppercase letters.

==Substance of balloons==
In several occasions, comics artists have used balloons (or similar narrative devices) as if they have true substance, usually for humorous [[meta-]]like purposes. In ''[[Peanuts]]'', for example, the notes played by [[Schroeder (Peanuts)|Schroeder]] occasionally take substance and are used in various ways, including Christmas decorations or perches for birds. Sometimes balloons can be influenced by the strip's environment: in the Italian strip ''[[Sturmtruppen]]'' they freeze and crack when the temperature is very low, or an [[Archie (comics)|Archie]] comic strip where two men from Alaska remarked on how cold it was, by saying the speech balloons froze as they said them, and the words had to be thawed out to be heard.

In the Flemish ''[[Suske en Wiske]]'' series, on one occasion a thought bubble full of mathematical formulas is cut open with scissors and its contents emptied in a bag, to be saved for later (in a manner not unlike the [[pensieve]] in the [[Harry Potter]] series). In the same series, speech balloons are occasionally even held and blown up to function as actual balloons or the words of the speech bubble are occasionally shown coming out the side of the speech bubble, to signify that the speaker is moving so fast that their words can't keep up with them, i.e. at [[supersonic]] speed.

In the novel ''[[Who Censored Roger Rabbit?]]'', the last words of a murdered Toon (cartoon character) are found under his body in the form of a speech balloon.

==Computer-generated speech balloons==
Many digital artists generate speech balloons with [[List of vector graphics editors|general-purpose illustration software]].  Products like [[Comic Book Creator]] for [[Microsoft Windows]], [[Comic Life]] for [[Mac OS X]] and Windows target the non-professional end of the market.

{{Campaignbox French Wars of Religion}}
The '''St. Bartholomew's Day massacre''' ({{lang-fr|Massacre de la Saint-Barthélemy}}) in 1572 was a targeted group of [[assassination]]s and a wave of [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] [[mob violence]], directed against the [[Huguenots]] (French [[Calvinist]] [[Protestant]]s) during the [[French Wars of Religion]]. Traditionally believed to have been instigated by Queen [[Catherine de' Medici]], the mother of King [[Charles IX of France|Charles IX]], the [[massacre]] took place a few days after the wedding day (18 August) of the king's sister [[Margaret of Valois|Margaret]] to the Protestant [[Henry III of Navarre]] (the future Henry IV of France). Many of the most wealthy and prominent Huguenots had gathered in largely Catholic [[Paris]] to attend the wedding.

The massacre began in the night of 23–24 August 1572 (the eve of the feast of [[Bartholomew the Apostle]]), two days after the attempted assassination of Admiral [[Gaspard II de Coligny|Gaspard de Coligny]], the military and political leader of the Huguenots. The king ordered the killing of a group of Huguenot leaders, including Coligny, and the slaughter spread throughout Paris. Lasting several weeks, the massacre expanded outward to other urban centres and the countryside. Modern estimates for the number of dead across France vary widely, from 5,000 to 30,000.

The massacre also marked a turning point in the [[French Wars of Religion]]. The Huguenot political movement was crippled by the loss of many of its prominent aristocratic leaders, as well as many re-conversions by the rank and file. Those who remained were increasingly radicalized. Though by no means unique, it "was the worst of the century's religious massacres".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Koenigsburger|first1=H.

==Background==
[[File:François Clouet - Admiral Gaspard II de Coligny.jpg|thumb|upright|Admiral [[Gaspard II de Coligny|Gaspard de Coligny]], the leader of the Huguenots]]

The Massacre of Saint Bartholomew's Day was the culmination of a series of events:
*The [[Peace of Saint-Germain-en-Laye]], which put an end to the third War of Religion on 8 August 1570.
*The marriage between [[Henry III of Navarre]] and [[Margaret of Valois]] on 18 August 1572.
*The failed assassination of Admiral de Coligny on 22 August 1572.

=== An unacceptable peace and an unacceptable marriage ===
The [[Peace of Saint-Germain]] put an end to three years of terrible civil war between Catholics and Protestants. This peace, however, was precarious since the more intransigent Catholics refused to accept it. The [[House of Guise|Guise]] family (strongly Catholic) was out of favour at the French court; the Huguenot leader, Admiral [[Gaspard II de Coligny|Gaspard de Coligny]], was readmitted into the king's council in September 1571. Staunch Catholics were shocked by the return of Protestants to the court, but the queen mother, [[Catherine de' Medici]], and her son, [[Charles IX of France|Charles IX]], were practical in their support of peace and Coligny, as they were conscious of the kingdom's financial difficulties and the Huguenots' strong defensive position: they controlled the fortified towns of [[La Rochelle]], [[La Charité-sur-Loire]], [[Cognac, France|Cognac]], and [[Montauban]].

To cement the peace between the two religious parties, Catherine planned to marry her daughter [[Margaret of Valois|Margaret]] to the Protestant prince, Henry of Navarre (the future King [[Henry IV of France|Henry IV]]), son of the Huguenot leader Queen [[Jeanne d'Albret]]. The royal marriage was arranged for 18 August 1572. It was not accepted by traditionalist Catholics or by the [[Pope Gregory XIII|Pope]]. Both the Pope and King [[Philip II of Spain]] strongly condemned Catherine's Huguenot policy as well.

===Tension in Paris===
[[File:Bemberg Fondation Toulouse - Portrait de Charles IX - François Clouet - Inv.1012.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Charles IX of France]], who was 22 years old in August 1572]]
The impending marriage led to the gathering of a large number of well-born Protestants in Paris, who had come to escort their prince. But Paris was a violently anti-Huguenot city, and Parisians, who tended to be extreme Catholics, found their presence unacceptable. Encouraged by Catholic preachers, they were horrified at the marriage of a princess of France with a Protestant.&lt;ref&gt;Lincoln (1989), pp. 93-94&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Parlement]]'s opposition and the court's absence from the wedding led to increased political tension.&lt;ref name="Shennan1998"&gt;{{cite book|author=J. H. Shennan|title=The Parlement of Paris|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HCOJAAAAMAAJ|year=1998|publisher=Sutton|isbn=978-0-7509-1830-5|page=25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Compounding this bad feeling was the fact that the harvests had been poor and taxes had risen.&lt;ref&gt;Knecht (2001), p. 359&lt;/ref&gt; The rise in food prices and the luxury displayed on the occasion of the royal wedding increased tensions among the common people. A particular point of tension was an open-air cross erected on the site of the house of [[Philippe de Gastines]], a Huguenot who had been executed in 1569. The mob had torn down his house and erected a large wooden [[cross]] on a stone base. Under the terms of the peace, and after considerable popular resistance, this had been removed in December 1571 (and re-erected in a cemetery), which had already led to about 50 deaths in riots, as well as mob destruction of property.&lt;ref&gt;Holt, Mack P. (2005). ''The French Wars of Religion 1562-1626'', Cambridge University Press, pp. 79-80 [https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;id=En23VTbYwhQC&amp;dq='The+French+Wars+of+Religion+1562+-+1629'&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=web&amp;ots=wBH9h9vUbu&amp;sig=GnD1UDWCtyelLY63ZgQJpC77p_M&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ct=result#PPA95,M1 google Books]&lt;/ref&gt; In the massacres of August, the relatives of the Gastines family were among the first to be killed by the mob.&lt;ref&gt;Holt (2005), p. 86&lt;/ref&gt;

The court itself was extremely divided. Catherine had not obtained Pope Gregory XIII's permission to celebrate this irregular marriage; consequently, the French prelates hesitated over which attitude to adopt. It took all the queen mother's skill to convince the [[Cardinal de Bourbon]] (paternal uncle of the Protestant groom, but himself a Catholic clergyman) to marry the couple. Beside this, the rivalries between the leading families re-emerged. The Guises were not prepared to make way for their rivals, the [[House of Montmorency]]. [[François de Montmorency|François, Duke of Montmorency]] and governor of Paris, was unable to control the disturbances in the city. On August 20, he left the capital and retired to [[Chantilly, Oise|Chantilly]].&lt;ref name="Daussy2002"&gt;{{cite book|author=Hugues Daussy|title=Les huguenots et le roi: le combat politique de Philippe Duplessis-Mornay, 1572-1600|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DxQjVTLAgC4C&amp;pg=PA84|year=2002|publisher=Librairie Droz|isbn=978-2-600-00667-5|page=84}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Shift in Huguenot thought===
In the years preceding the massacre, Huguenot "political rhetoric" had for the first time taken a tone against not just the policies of a particular monarch of France, but [[monarchy]] in general. In part this was led by an apparent change in stance by [[John Calvin]] in his ''Readings on the Prophet [[Daniel (biblical figure)|Daniel]]'', a book of 1561, in which he had argued that when kings disobey God, they "automatically abdicate their worldly power" – a change from his views in earlier works that even ungodly kings should be obeyed. This change was soon picked up by Huguenot writers, who began to expand on Calvin and promote the idea of the [[Popular sovereignty|sovereignty of the people]], ideas to which Catholic writers and preachers responded fiercely.&lt;ref&gt;Holt (2005), pp. 78-79; Calvin's book was "Praelectiones in librum prophetiarum Danielis", Geneva and [[Laon]], 1561&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, it was only in the aftermath of the massacre that anti-monarchical ideas found widespread support from Huguenots, among the "[[Monarchomachs]]" and others. "Huguenot writers, who had previously, for the most part, paraded their loyalty to the Crown, now called for the deposition or assassination of a Godless king who had either authorised or permitted the slaughter".&lt;ref&gt;{{aut|[[Felipe Fernández-Armesto|Fernández-Armesto, F.]]}} &amp; Wilson, D. (1996), ''Reformation: Christianity and the World 1500 – 2000'', Bantam Press, London, {{ISBN|0-593-02749-3}} paperback, p. 237&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the massacre "marked the beginning of a new form of French Protestantism: one that was openly at war with the crown. This was much more than a war against the policies of the crown, as in the first three civil wars; it was a campaign against the very existence of the [[Gallicanism|Gallican]] monarchy itself".&lt;ref&gt;Holt (1995 ed), p. 95&lt;/ref&gt;

===Huguenot intervention in the Netherlands===
Tensions were further raised when in May 1572 the news reached Paris that a French Huguenot army under [[Louis of Nassau]] had crossed from France to the [[Netherlandish]] province of [[Hainaut (province)|Hainaut]] and captured the Catholic strongholds of [[Mons]] and [[Valenciennes]] (now in Belgium and France, respectively). Louis governed the [[Principality of Orange]] around [[Avignon]] in southern France for his brother [[William the Silent]], who was leading the [[Dutch Revolt]] against the Spanish. This intervention threatened to involve France in that war; many Catholics believed that Coligny had again persuaded the king to intervene on the side of the Dutch,&lt;ref name="Holt81"&gt;Holt (2005), p. 81&lt;/ref&gt; as he had managed to do the previous October, before Catherine had got the decision reversed.&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert Jean Knecht|Knecht, Robert Jean]] (2001), ''The Rise and Fall of Renaissance France, 1483-1610'', p. 356, Blackwell Publishing, {{ISBN|0-631-22729-6}}, {{ISBN|978-0-631-22729-8}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=nuyx5E_wp7QC&amp;pg=PA355&amp;dq=Elizabeth+England+St+Bartholomew%27s+Day&amp;as_brr=3#PPA356,M1 Google Books]&lt;/ref&gt;

===The attempted assassination of Admiral de Coligny===
{{unreferenced|section|date=August 2017}}
[[File:Frans Hogenberg, The St. Bartholomew's Day massacre, circa 1572.jpg|thumb|This [[popular print]] shows the attempted assassination of Coligny at left, his subsequent murder at right, and scenes of the general massacre in the streets.]]
After the wedding on 18 August 1572, Coligny and the leading Huguenots remained in Paris to discuss some outstanding grievances about the Peace of St. Germain with the king. On 22 August, an attempt was made on Coligny's life as he made his way back to his house from the Louvre. He was shot from an upstairs window, and seriously wounded. The would-be assassin, probably Charles de Louviers, Lord of Maurevert (c. 1505-1583), escaped in the ensuing confusion, and it is still difficult today to decide who was ultimately responsible for the attack. History records three possible candidates:

*The Guises: the [[Charles, Cardinal of Lorraine|Cardinal of Lorraine]] (who was in fact in Rome at the time), and his nephews, the Dukes of Guise and [[Claude, Duke of Aumale|Aumale]], are the most likely suspects. The leaders of the Catholic party, they wanted to avenge the death of the two dukes' father [[Francis, Duke of Guise]], whose assassination ten years earlier they believed to have been ordered by Coligny. The shot aimed at Admiral de Coligny came from a house belonging to the Guises.
*The [[Fernando Álvarez de Toledo, 3rd Duke of Alba|Duke of Alba]]: he governed the Netherlands on behalf of Philip II. Coligny planned to lead a campaign in the Netherlands to participate in the [[Dutch Revolt]] to free the region from Spanish control. During the summer, Coligny had secretly dispatched a number of troops to help the Protestants in Mons, who were now besieged by the Duke of Alba. So Admiral de Coligny was a real threat to the latter.
*Catherine de' Medici: according to tradition, the Queen Mother had been worried that the king was increasingly becoming dominated by Coligny. Amongst other things, Catherine reportedly feared that Coligny's influence would drag France into a war with Spain over the Netherlands.&lt;ref name="Holt1995"&gt;{{cite book|author=Mack P. Holt|title=The French Wars of Religion, 1562-1629|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dUBQKCEhylIC&amp;pg=PA83|date=19 October 1995|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-35873-6|page=83}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The massacres==

===Paris===
The attempted assassination of Coligny triggered the crisis that led to the [[List of massacres|massacre]]. Admiral de Coligny was the most respected Huguenot leader and enjoyed a close relationship with the king, although he was distrusted by the king's mother. Aware of the danger of reprisals from the Protestants, the king and his court visited Coligny on his sickbed and promised him that the culprits would be punished. While the Queen Mother was eating dinner, Protestants burst in to demand justice, some talking in menacing terms.&lt;ref&gt;Garrisson, pp. 82-83, and Lincoln, p. 96, and Knecht (2001), p. 361&lt;/ref&gt; Fears of Huguenot reprisals grew. Coligny's brother-in-law led a 4,000-strong army camped just outside Paris&lt;ref name="Holt81"/&gt; and, although there is no evidence it was planning to attack, Catholics in the city feared it might take revenge on the Guises or the city populace itself.

That evening, Catherine held a meeting at the [[Tuileries]] Palace with her Italian advisers, including [[Albert de Gondi]], Comte de Retz. On the evening of 23 August, Catherine went to see the king to discuss the crisis. Though no details of the meeting survive, Charles IX and his mother apparently made the decision to eliminate the Protestant leaders. Holt speculated this entailed "between two and three dozen noblemen" who were still in Paris.&lt;ref&gt;Holt (2005), p. 85.&lt;/ref&gt; Other historians are reluctant to speculate on the composition or size of the group leaders targeted at this point, beyond the few obvious heads. (Like Coligny, most potential candidates were accompanied by groups of gentlemen as staff and bodyguards; so each killing of a leader could have been expected to involve killing these as well.) 

Shortly after this decision, the municipal authorities of Paris were summoned. They were ordered to shut the city gates and arm the citizenry to prevent any attempt at a Protestant uprising. The king's [[Swiss Guard]] was given the task of killing a list of leading Protestants. It is difficult today to determine the exact chronology of events and to know the moment the killing began. It seems probable that a signal was given by ringing bells for [[matins]] (between midnight and dawn) at the church of [[Saint-Germain l'Auxerrois]], near the Louvre, which was the parish church of the kings of France. The Swiss guards expelled the Protestant nobles from the Louvre castle and then slaughtered them in the streets.

A group led by Guise in person dragged Admiral Coligny from his bed, killed him, and threw his body out of a window. Huguenot nobles in the building first put up a fight, as they were terrified for the life of their leader,&lt;ref&gt;Knecht (2001), p. 364. The site is now 144 [[Rue de Rivoli]], with a plaque commemorating the event, though both building and street layout postdate the 16th century. [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9A04E4DD1739E233A25752C2A9609C94669FD7CF New York Times on the plaque]&lt;/ref&gt; but Coligny himself seemed unperturbed. One of Coligny's murderers recognized this calm regarding his fate by stating that "he never saw anyone less afraid in so great a peril, nor die more steadfastly" (Dethou).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=De Thou|first1=Jacques- Auguste|title=Histoire des choses arrivees de son temps|publisher=Boston: Ginn and Company}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tension that had been building since the Peace of St. Germain now exploded in a wave of popular violence. The common people began to hunt Protestants throughout the city, including women and children. Chains were used to block streets so that Protestants could not escape from their houses. The bodies of the dead were collected in carts and thrown into the [[Seine]]. The massacre in Paris lasted three days despite the king's attempts to stop it. Holt concludes that "while the general massacre might have been prevented, there is no evidence that it was intended by any of the elites at court", listing a number of cases where Catholic courtiers intervened to save individual Protestants who were not in the leadership.&lt;ref&gt;Holt (2005 edn), pp. 88-91 (quotation from p. 91)&lt;/ref&gt;

The two leading Huguenot princes, Henry of Navarre and his cousin the [[Henri I de Bourbon, prince de Condé|Prince of Condé]] (respectively aged 19 and 20), were spared as they pledged to convert to Catholicism; both renounced their conversions after they escaped Paris.&lt;ref name="Dyer1861"&gt;{{cite book |last=Dyer |first=Thomas Henry |authorlink=Thomas Henry Dyer |title=The history of modern Europe: from the fall of Constantinople in 1453 to the war in the Crimea in 1857|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ErgyAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA268|accessdate=28 March 2011|year=1861|publisher=John Murray|page=268}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to some interpretations, the survival of these princes was a key point in Catherine's overall scheme, to prevent the House of Guise from becoming too powerful.

On August 26, the king and court established the official version of events by going to the [[Paris Parlement]]. "Holding a [[lit de justice]], Charles declared that he had ordered the massacre in order to thwart a Huguenot plot against the royal family."&lt;ref name="Lincoln98"&gt;Lincoln, p. 98&lt;/ref&gt; A jubilee celebration, including a procession, was then held, while the killings continued in parts of the city.&lt;ref name="Lincoln98"/&gt;

===In the provinces===
Although Charles had dispatched orders to his provincial governors on August 24 to prevent violence and maintain the terms of the 1570 edict,&lt;ref name="Holt91"&gt;Holt (2005 ed.), p. 91&lt;/ref&gt; from August to October, similar massacres of Huguenots took place in a total of twelve other cities: [[Toulouse]], [[Bordeaux]], [[Lyon]], [[Bourges]], [[Rouen]],&lt;ref&gt;Benedict, Philip (2004), [https://books.google.com/books?id=N4hwtKRfj8UC&amp;pg=PA128&amp;dq=%22St+Bartholomew%27s+day+Massacre%22+deaths&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3#PPA127,M1 ''Rouen During the Wars of Religion''], Cambridge University Press, {{ISBN|0-521-54797-0}}, {{ISBN|978-0-521-54797-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Orléans]], [[Meaux]], [[Angers]], [[La Charité]], [[Saumur]], [[Gaillac]] and [[Troyes]].&lt;ref&gt;Holt (2005 ed.), p. 91. The dates are in Garrison, p. 139, who adds [[Albi]] to the 12 in Holt. [https://books.google.com/books?id=wfFDhvXCS90C&amp;pg=PA144&amp;dq=St.+Bartholomew%27s+Day+massacre+Auger+Bordeaux&amp;as_brr=3#PPA139,M1 online]&lt;/ref&gt; In most of them, the killings swiftly followed the arrival of the news of the Paris massacre, but in some places there was a delay of more than a month. According to Mack P. Holt: "All twelve cities where provincial massacres occurred had one striking feature in common; they were all cities with Catholic majorities where there had once been ''significant'' Protestant minorities.... All of them had also experienced serious religious division... during the first three civil wars... Moreover seven of them shared a previous experience ... [they] had actually been taken over by Protestant minorities during the first civil war..."&lt;ref name="Holt91"/&gt;

[[File:Le Siege de La Rochelle par le Duc d Anjou en 1573.jpg|thumb|The [[Siege of La Rochelle (1572–1573)]] began soon after the St. Bartholomew massacre.]]
In several cases the Catholic party in the city believed they had received orders from the king to begin the massacre, some conveyed by visitors to the city, and in other cases apparently coming from a local nobleman or his agent.&lt;ref&gt;Holt (2005 ed.), pp. 93-94, and Benedict (2004), p. 127&lt;/ref&gt; It seems unlikely any such orders came from the king, although the Guise faction may have desired the massacres.&lt;ref&gt;Benedict (2004), p. 127&lt;/ref&gt; Apparently genuine letters from the [[Henry III of France|Duke of Anjou]], the king's younger brother, did urge massacres in the king's name; in [[Nantes]] the mayor fortunately held on to his without publicising it until a week later when contrary orders from the king had arrived.&lt;ref&gt;Knecht (2001), p. 367&lt;/ref&gt; In some cities the massacres were led by the mob, while the city authorities tried to suppress them, and in others small groups of soldiers and officials began rounding up Protestants with little mob involvement.&lt;ref&gt;Knecht (2001), p. 368, though see Holt (2005), pp. 93-95 for a different emphasis&lt;/ref&gt; In Bordeaux the inflammatory sermon on September 29 of a [[Jesuit]], Edmond Auger, encouraged the massacre that was to occur a few days later.&lt;ref&gt;("Emond" or "Edmond"). Garrison, pp. 144-45, who rejects the view that this "met le feu au poudres" (lit the powder) in Bordeaux. See also: Pearl, Jonathan L. (1998), ''The Crime of Crimes: Demonology and Politics in France, 1560-1620'', Wilfrid Laurier Univ. Press, p. 70, {{ISBN|978-0-88920-296-2}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=2TJeVkAMz5sC&amp;pg=PA70&amp;dq=St.+Bartholomew%27s+Day+massacre+Auger+Bordeaux&amp;as_brr=3#PPA70,M1 Google Books]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the cities affected the loss to the Huguenot communities after the massacres was numerically far larger than those actually killed; in the following weeks there were mass conversions to Catholicism, apparently in response to the threatening atmosphere for Huguenots in these cities. In Rouen, where some hundreds were killed, the Huguenot community shrank from 16,500 to fewer than 3,000 mainly as a result of conversions and emigration to safer cities or countries. Some cities unaffected by the violence nevertheless witnessed a sharp decline in their Huguenot population.&lt;ref&gt;Holt (2005 ed.), p. 95, citing Benedict (2004), pp. 127-132&lt;/ref&gt;  It has been claimed that the Huguenot community represented as much as 10% of the French population on the eve of the St. Bartholomew's Day massacre, declining to 7-8% by the end of the 16th century, and further after heavy persecution began once again during the reign of [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]], culminating with the [[Revocation of the Edict of Nantes]].&lt;ref&gt;Hans J. Hillerbrand in his ''Encyclopedia of Protestantism: 4-volume Set''&lt;/ref&gt;

Soon afterward both sides prepared for a [[French Wars of Religion#The 'fourth' war (1572–73)|fourth civil war]], which began before the end of the year.

===Death toll===
Estimates of the number that perished in the massacres have varied from 2,000 by a Roman Catholic apologist to 70,000 by the contemporary Huguenot [[Maximilien de Béthune, duc de Sully|duc de Sully]], who himself barely escaped death.&lt;ref&gt;''Saint Bartholomew's Day, Massacre of'' (2008) Encyclopædia Britannica Deluxe Edition, Chicago; [[Hardouin de Péréfixe de Beaumont]], Catholic [[Archbishop of Paris]] a century later, put the number at 100,000, but "This last number is probably exaggerated, if we reckon only those who perished by a violent death. But if we add those who died from wretchedness, hunger, sorrow, abandoned old men, women without shelter, children without bread,—all the miserable whose life was shortened by this great catastrophe, we shall see that the estimate of Péréfixe is still below the reality."

The [[Politique]]s, those Catholics who placed national unity above sectarian interests, were horrified, but many Catholics inside and outside France initially regarded the massacres as deliverance from an imminent Huguenot [[coup d'etat]]. The severed head of Coligny was apparently dispatched to [[Pope Gregory XIII]], though it got no further than Lyon, and the pope sent the king a [[Golden Rose]].&lt;ref&gt;{{aut|[[H. A. L.

[[File:Giorgio Vasari San Bartolomeo.jpg|thumb|right|The massacre, with the murder of [[Gaspard II de Coligny|Gaspard de Coligny]] above left, as depicted in a fresco by [[Giorgio Vasari]].]] Pope Gregory XIII also commissioned the artist [[Giorgio Vasari]] to paint three frescos in the [[Sala Regia (Vatican)|Sala Regia]] depicting the wounding of Coligny, his death, and Charles IX before Parliament, matching those commemorating the defeat of the Turks at the [[Battle of Lepanto]] (1571). "The massacre was interpreted as an act of [[divine retribution]]; Coligny was considered a threat to [[Christendom]] and thus Pope Gregory XIII designated 11 September 1572 as a joint commemoration of the Battle of Lepanto and the massacre of the Huguenots."&lt;ref&gt;Howe, E.

Although these formal acts of rejoicing in Rome were not repudiated publicly, misgivings in the papal curia grew as the true nature of the killings gradually became better known. Pope Gregory XIII himself refused to receive Charles de Maurevert, said to be the killer of Coligny, on the ground that he was a murderer.&lt;ref&gt;[[Henri Daniel-Rops|Daniel-Rops, Henri]] (1964), ''The Catholic Reformation''.

[[Vasari]] for [[Pope Gregory XIII]], [[Sala Regia (Vatican)]].]]

The author of the ''Lettre de Pierre Charpentier'' (1572) was not only "a Protestant of sorts, and thus, apparently, writing with inside knowledge", but also "an extreme apologist for the massacre ... in his view ... a well-merited punishment for years of civil disobedience [and] secret sedition..."&lt;ref&gt;Anglo, p. 251&lt;/ref&gt; A strand of Catholic writing, especially by Italian authors, broke from the official French line to applaud the massacre as precisely a brilliant stratagem, deliberately planned from various points beforehand.&lt;ref&gt;Anglo, p. 253ff&lt;/ref&gt; The most extreme of these writers was Camilo Capilupi, a papal secretary, whose work insisted that the whole series of events since 1570 had been a masterly plan conceived by Charles IX, and carried through by frequently misleading his mother and ministers as to his true intentions. The Venetian government refused to allow the work to be printed there, and it was eventually published in Rome in 1574, and in the same year quickly reprinted in Geneva in the original Italian and a French translation.&lt;ref&gt;Anglo, pp. 254-65&lt;/ref&gt;

It was in this context that the massacre came to be seen as a product of [[Machiavellianism]], a view greatly influenced by the Huguenot [[:fr:Innocent Gentillet|Innocent Gentillet]], who published his ''Discours contre Machievel'' in 1576, which was printed in ten editions in three languages over the next four years.&lt;ref&gt;Anglo, p. 283, see also the whole chapter&lt;/ref&gt; Gentillet held, quite wrongly according to Sydney Anglo, that [[Machiavelli]]'s "books [were] held most dear and precious by our Italian and Italionized courtiers" (in the words of his first English translation), and so (in Anglo's paraphrase) "at the root of France's present degradation, which has culminated not only in the St Bartholemew massacre but the glee of its perverted admirers".&lt;ref&gt;Anglo, p. 286&lt;/ref&gt; In fact there is little trace of Machiavelli in French writings before the massacre, and not very much after, until Gentillet's own book, but this concept was seized upon by many contemporaries, and played a crucial part in setting the long-lasting popular concept of Machiavellianism that so infuriates scholars of his actual thought.&lt;ref&gt;Anglo, Chapters 10 and 11; p. 328 etc.&lt;/ref&gt; It also gave added impetus to the strong anti-Italian feelings already present in Huguenot polemic.

[[Christopher Marlowe]] was one of many Elizabethan writers who were enthusiastic proponents of these ideas. In the ''[[Jew of Malta]]'' (1589–90) "Machievel" in person speaks the Prologue, claiming to not be dead, but to have possessed the soul of (the Duke of) Guise, "And, now the Guise is dead, is come from France/ To view this land, and frolic with his friends" (Prologue, lines 3-4)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gutenberg.org/files/901/901-h/901-h.htm Project Gutenberg] ''Jew of Malta'' text.&lt;/ref&gt; His last play, ''[[The Massacre at Paris]]'' (1593) takes the massacre, and the following years, as its subject, with Guise and Catherine both depicted as Machiavellian plotters, bent on evil from the start. The [[Catholic Encyclopedia]] of 1913 was still ready to endorse a version of this view, describing the massacres as "an entirely political act committed in the name of the immoral principles of Machiavellianism" and blaming "the pagan theories of a certain [[raison d'état]] according to which [[Consequentialism|the end justified the means]]".&lt;ref name="cathen" /&gt;

The French 18th-century historian [[Louis-Pierre Anquetil]], in his ''Esprit de la Ligue'' of 1767, was among the first to begin impartial historical investigation, emphasizing the lack of premeditation (before the attempt on Coligny) in the massacre and that Catholic mob violence had a history of uncontrollable escalation.&lt;ref&gt;Whitehead, Barbara (1994), "Revising the Revisionists," in: ''Politics, Ideology, and the Law in Early Modern Europe: Essays in Honor of J.H.M.

The question of whether the massacre had long been premeditated was not entirely settled until the late 19th century; [[Lord Acton]] changed his mind on the matter twice, finally concluding that it was not.&lt;ref&gt;The subject of Butterfield's chapter, referenced below.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interpretations==
===Role of the royal family===
[[File:Catherine de Medicis.jpg|thumb|right|[[Catherine de Medici]], Charles IX's mother]]
Over the centuries, the St. Bartholomew's Day massacre has inevitably aroused a great deal of controversy. Modern historians are still divided over the responsibility of the royal family:

*The traditional interpretation makes Catherine de Medici and her Catholic advisers the principal culprits in the execution of the principal military leaders. They forced the hand of a hesitant and weak-willed king in the decision of that particular execution. This traditional interpretation has been largely abandoned by modern historians including, among others, Janine Garrisson. However, in a more recent work than his history of the period, Holt concludes: "The ringleaders of the conspiracy appear to have been a group of four men: Henry, duke of Anjou; [[René de Birague|Chancellor Birague]]; the [[Louis Gonzaga, Duke of Nevers|duke of Nevers]], and the comte de Retz" (Gondi).&lt;ref&gt;Holt, Mack P. (2002), ''The Duke of Anjou and the Politique Struggle During the Wars of Religion'', Cambridge University Press, {{ISBN|0-521-89278-3}}, {{ISBN|978-0-521-89278-0}}
[https://books.google.com/books?id=-OJscrcxTLsC&amp;pg=PA26&amp;dq=Elizabeth+Bartholomew%27s+Day+Massacre&amp;as_brr=3#PPA20,M1 p. 20]&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from Anjou, the others were all Italian advisors at the French court.

*According to [[Denis Crouzet]], Charles IX feared a Protestant uprising, and chose to strangle it at birth to protect his power. The execution decision was therefore his own, and not Catherine de' Medici's.&lt;ref&gt;Crouzet, Denis (1994), ''La Nuit de la Saint-Barthélemy: Un rêve perdu de la Renaissance'', Fayard, coll. " Chroniques ", {{ISBN|2-213-59216-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*According to [[:fr:Jean-Louis Bourgeon|Jean-Louis Bourgeon]], the violently anti-Huguenot city of Paris was really responsible. He stresses that the city was on the verge of revolt. The Guises, who were highly popular, exploited this situation to put pressure on the King and the Queen Mother. Charles IX was thus forced to head off the potential riot, which was the work of the Guises, the city militia and the common people.&lt;ref&gt;Bourgeon, Jean-Louis (1992), ''L'assassinat de Coligny'', Genève: Droz&lt;/ref&gt;
*According to [[:fr:Thierry Wanegffelen|Thierry Wanegffelen]], the member of the royal family with the most responsibility in this affair is Henry, Duke of Anjou, the king's ambitious younger brother. Following the failed assassination attack against the Admiral de Coligny (which Wanegffelen attributes to the Guise family and Spain), the Italian advisers of Catherine de Medici undoubtedly recommended in the royal Council the execution of about fifty Protestant leaders. These Italians stood to benefit from the occasion by eliminating the Huguenot danger. Despite the firm opposition of the Queen Mother and the King, Anjou, Lieutenant General of the Kingdom, present at this meeting of the Council, could see a good occasion to make a name for himself with the government. He contacted the Parisian authorities and another ambitious young man, running out of authority and power, Duke Henri de Guise (whose uncle, the clear-sighted Charles, cardinal of Lorraine, was then detained in Rome). The Parisian St. Bartholomew's Day Massacre resulted from this conjunction of interests, and this offers a much better explanation as to why the men of the Duke of Anjou acted in the name of the Lieutenant General of the Kingdom, consistent with the thinking of the time, rather than in the name of the King. One can also understand why, the day after the start of the massacre, Catherine de Medici, through royal declaration of Charles IX, condemned the crimes, and threatened the Guise family with royal justice. But when Charles IX and his mother learned of the involvement of the duke of Anjou, and being so dependent on his support, they issued a second royal declaration, which while asking for an end to the massacres, credited the initiative with the desire of Charles IX to prevent a Protestant plot. Initially the ''coup d'état'' of the duke of Anjou was a success, but Catherine de Medici went out of her way to deprive him from any power in France: she sent him with the royal army to remain in front of La Rochelle and then had him elected King of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth.&lt;ref&gt;Wanegffelen, Thierry (2005), ''Catherine de Médicis: Le pouvoir au féminin'', Payot {{ISBN|2228900184}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Role of the religious factions===
Traditional histories have tended to focus more on the roles of the political notables whose machinations began the massacre than the mindset of those who actually did the killing. Ordinary lay Catholics were involved in the mass killings; they believed they were executing the wishes of the king and of God. At this time, in an age before mass media, "the pulpit remained probably the most effective means of mass communication".&lt;ref&gt;Atkin, N. &amp; Tallett, F. (2003) ''Priests, Prelates &amp; People: A History of European Catholicism Since 1750'', Oxford University Press, Oxford, {{ISBN|0-19-521987-2}} hardback, p. 9;&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the large numbers of pamphlets and [[broadsheet]]s in circulation, literacy rates were still poor. Thus, some modern historians have stressed the critical and incendiary role that militant preachers played in shaping ordinary lay beliefs, both Catholic and Protestant.

Historian [[Barbara B. Diefendorf]], Professor of History at [[Boston University]], wrote that [[Simon Vigor]] had "said if the King ordered the Admiral (Coligny) killed, 'it would be wicked not to kill him'. With these words, the most popular preacher in Paris legitimised in advance the events of St. Bartholomew's Day".&lt;ref&gt;Diefendorf, B.B. (1991) ''Beneath The Cross: Catholics &amp; Huguenots in Sixteenth Century Paris'', Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|0-1950-7013-5}} paperback, p. 157&lt;/ref&gt; Diefendorf says that when the head of the murdered Coligny was shown to the Paris mob by a member of the nobility, with the claim that it was the King's will, the die was cast. Another historian Mack P. Holt, Professor at [[George Mason University]], agrees that Vigor, "the best known preacher in Paris," preached sermons that were full of references to the evils that would befall the capital should the Protestants seize control.&lt;ref&gt;Holt, M. P. (1995) ''The French Wars of Religion 1562 – 1629'', Cambridge University Press, {{ISBN|0-521-35359-9}} hardback, pp. 88-89&lt;/ref&gt; This view is also partly supported by Cunningham and Grell (2000) who explained that "militant sermons by priests such as Simon Vigor served to raise the religious and eschatological temperature on the eve of the Massacre".&lt;ref&gt;Cunningham, A. &amp; Grell, O. P. (2000) ''The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse: Religion, War, Famine &amp; Death in Reformation Europe'', Cambridge University Press, {{ISBN|0-521-46701-2}} paperback, p. 151&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Henry, third duke of Guise.jpg|thumb|left|Henry, duc de Guise, leader of the [[Catholic League (French)|Catholic League]].]]

Historians cite the extreme tension and bitterness that led to the powder-keg atmosphere of Paris in August 1572.&lt;ref&gt;Holt, (1995), p. 86&lt;/ref&gt; In the previous ten years there had already been three outbreaks of civil war, and attempts by Protestant nobles to seize power in France.&lt;ref&gt;Holt, (1995), p. 44&lt;/ref&gt; Some blame the complete esteem with which the sovereign's office was held, justified by prominent French Roman Catholic theologians, and that the special powers of French Kings "...were accompanied by explicit responsibilities, the foremost of which was combating heresy."&lt;ref&gt;Holt (1995 ed.), p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;

Holt, notable for re-emphasising the importance of religious issues, as opposed to political/dynastic power struggles or socio-economic tensions, in explaining the French Wars of Religion, also re-emphasised the role of religion in the St Bartholomew's Day Massacre. He noted that the extra violence inflicted on many of the corpses "was not random at all, but patterned after the rites of the Catholic culture that had given birth to it." "Many Protestant houses were burned, invoking the traditional purification by fire of all heretics. Many victims were also thrown into the Seine, invoking the purification by water of Catholic baptism".&lt;ref name="Holt87"&gt;Holt (1995 ed.), p. 87&lt;/ref&gt; Viewed as a threat to the social and political order, Holt argues that "Huguenots not only had to be exterminated – that is, killed – they also had to be humiliated, dishonoured, and shamed as the inhuman beasts they were perceived to be."&lt;ref name="Holt87"/&gt;

However Raymond Mentzer points out that Protestants "could be as bloodthirsty as Catholics. Earlier Huguenot rage at Nimes (in 1567) led to... the massacre of a hundred or so Catholics, mostly priests and prominent laymen, at the hands of their Protestant neighbours. Few towns escaped the episodic violence and some suffered repeatedly from both sides. Neither faith had a monopoly on cruelty and misguided fervour".&lt;ref&gt;Mentzer, Raymond A., ''The French Wars of Religion'' in ''The Reformation World'', Ed. Andrew Pettegree, Routledge, (2000), {{ISBN|0-415-16357-9}}, p. 332&lt;/ref&gt;

Some, like Leonie Frieda, emphasise the element within the mob violence of the "haves" being "killed by the 'have-nots'". Many Protestants were nobles or bourgeois and Frieda adds that "a number of bourgeois Catholic Parisians had suffered the same fate as the Protestants; many financial debts were wiped clean with the death of creditors and moneylenders that night".&lt;ref&gt;Frieda, L. (2003) ''Catherine de Medici'', Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson, {{ISBN|0-7538-2039-0}}, pp. 314-16&lt;/ref&gt; At least one Huguenot was able to buy off his would-be murderers.&lt;ref&gt;Knecht (2001), p. 364&lt;/ref&gt;

The historian H.G. Koenigsberger (who until his retirement in 1984 was Professor of History at King's College, [[University of London]]) wrote that the Massacre was deeply disturbing because "it was Christians massacring other Christians who were not foreign enemies but their neighbours with which they and their forebears had lived in a Christian community, and under the same ruler, for a thousand years".&lt;ref&gt;Koenigsberger, H. G. (1987) ''Early Modern Europe 1500 – 1789'', Longman, Harlow, {{ISBN|0-582-49401-X}} paperback, p. 115&lt;/ref&gt; He concludes that the historical importance of the Massacre "lies not so much in the appalling tragedies involved as their demonstration of the power of sectarian passion to break down the barriers of civilisation, community and accepted morality".&lt;ref&gt;Koenigsberger, p. 115&lt;/ref&gt;

An explanation of this may lie in the analysis of the massacre in terms of [[social anthropology]] by the religious historian [[Bruce Lincoln]], who describes how the religious divide, which gave the Huguenots different patterns of dress, eating and pastimes, as well as the obvious differences of religion and (very often) class, had become a social schism or cleavage. The rituals around the royal marriage had only intensified this cleavage, contrary to its intentions, and the "sentiments of estrangement – radical otherness – [had come] to prevail over sentiments of affinity between Catholics and Protestants".&lt;ref&gt;Lincoln, chapter 6, pp. 89-102, quotation from p. 102&lt;/ref&gt;

On 23 August 1997, [[Pope John Paul II]], who was in Paris for the 12th World Youth Day, issued a statement on the Massacre. He stayed in Paris for three days and made eleven speeches. According to Reuters and the Associated Press, at a late-night vigil, with the hundreds of thousands of young people who were in Paris for the celebrations, he made the following comments: "On the eve of Aug. 24, we cannot forget the sad massacre of St. Bartholomew's Day, an event of very obscure causes in the political and religious history of France. ... Christians did things which the Gospel condemns. I am convinced that only forgiveness, offered and received, leads little by little to a fruitful dialogue, which will in turn ensure a fully Christian reconciliation. ... Belonging to different religious traditions must not constitute today a source of opposition and tension. On the contrary, our common love for Christ impels us to seek tirelessly the path of full unity."&lt;ref&gt;https://w2.vatican.va/content/john-paul-ii/en/travels/1997/documents/hf_jp-ii_spe_23081997_vigil.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Elizabethan]] dramatist [[Christopher Marlowe]] knew the story well from the Huguenot literature translated into English, and probably from French refugees who had sought refuge in his native [[Canterbury]]. He wrote a strongly anti-Catholic and anti-French play based on the events entitled '[[The Massacre at Paris]]'. Also, in his biography ''The World of Christopher Marlowe'', David Riggs claims the incident remained with the playwright, and massacres are incorporated into the final acts of three of his early plays, ''1'' and ''2 Tamburlaine'' and ''The Jew of Malta'' – see above for Marlowe and Machiavellism.

The story was also taken up in 1772 by [[Louis-Sébastien Mercier]] in his play ''Jean Hennuyer, Bishop of Lizieux'', unperformed until the [[French Revolution]].  This play was translated into English, with some adaptations, as ''The Massacre'' by the actress and playwright [[Elizabeth Inchbald]] in 1792. Inchbald kept the historical setting, but ''The Massacre'', completed by February 1792, also reflected events in the recent French Revolution, though not the [[September Massacres]] of 1792, which coincided with its printing.&lt;ref&gt;Burdett, Sarah, Sarah Burdett, "'Feminine Virtues Violated’ Motherhood, Female Militancy and

[[Joseph Chénier]]'s play ''Charles IX'' was a huge success during the French Revolution, drawing strongly anti-monarchical and anti-religious lessons from the massacre. Chénier was able to put his principles into practice as a politician, voting for the execution of [[Louis XVI]] and many others, perhaps including his brother [[André Chénier]]. However, before the collapse of the Revolution he became suspected of moderation, and in some danger himself.&lt;ref&gt;Maslan, Susan (2005), ''Revolutionary Acts: Theater, Democracy, and the French Revolution'', Johns Hopkins University Press, {{ISBN|0-8018-8125-0}}, {{ISBN|978-0-8018-8125-1}}

The story was fictionalised by [[Prosper Mérimée]] in his ''Chronique du règne de Charles IX'' (1829), and by [[Alexandre Dumas, père]] in ''[[La Reine Margot (novel)|La Reine Margot]]'', an 1845 novel that fills in the history as it was then seen with romance and adventure. That novel has been translated into English and was made first into a commercially successful [[French film]] in 1954, "[[La Reine Margot (1954 film)|La reine Margot]]" (US title "A Woman of Evil"), starring [[Jeanne Moreau]]. It was remade in 1994 as ''[[La Reine Margot (1994 film)|La Reine Margot]]'' (later as ''Queen Margot'', and subtitled, in English-language markets), starring [[Isabelle Adjani]].

[[Giacomo Meyerbeer]]'s [[opera]] ''[[Les Huguenots]]'' (1836), very loosely based on the events of the massacre, was one of the most popular and spectacular examples of French [[grand opera]].

The [[Pre-Raphaelite]] painter [[John Everett Millais]] managed to create a sentimental moment in the massacre in his painting ''[[A Huguenot|A Huguenot on St. Bartholomew's Day]]'' (1852), which depicts a Catholic woman attempting to convince her Huguenot lover to wear the white scarf badge of the Catholics and protect himself. The man, true to his beliefs, gently refuses her.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.humanitiesweb.org/human.php?s=g&amp;p=c&amp;a=p&amp;ID=216|title=A Huguenot on St Bartholomew's Day|accessdate=2007-04-19|publisher=Humanities Web}}&lt;/ref&gt; Millais was inspired to create the painting after seeing Meyerbeer's ''Les Huguenots''.

[[Mark Twain]] described the massacre in "From the Manuscript of 'A Tramp Abroad' (1879): The French and the Comanches," an essay about "partly civilized races." He wrote in part, "St. Bartholomew's was unquestionably the finest thing of the kind ever devised and accomplished in the world. All the best people took a hand in it, the King and the Queen Mother included."&lt;ref&gt;Letters from Earth. Ostara publications. 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

The St. Bartholomew's Day Massacre and the events surrounding it were incorporated into [[D.W. Griffith]]'s film ''[[Intolerance (movie)|Intolerance]]'' (1916). The film follows [[Catherine de' Medici]] ([[Josephine Crowell]]) plotting the massacre, coercing her son King [[Charles IX of France|Charles IX]] (Frank Bennett) to sanction it. Incidental characters include Henri of Navarre, [[Marguerite de Valois]] ([[Constance Talmadge]]), [[Admiral Coligny]] ([[Joseph Henabery]]) and the Duke of Anjou, who is portrayed as homosexual. These historic scenes are depicted alongside a fictional plot in which a Huguenot family is caught among the events.

Another novel depicting this massacre is ''[[Queen Jezebel (novel)|Queen Jezebel]]'', by [[Jean Plaidy]] (1953).  In the third episode of the [[BBC]] miniseries ''[[Elizabeth R]]'' (1971), starring [[Glenda Jackson]] as Queen Elizabeth I of England, the English court's reaction to the massacre and its effect on England's relations with France is addressed in depth.

A 1966 serial in the [[United Kingdom|British]] [[science fiction on television|science fiction television]] series ''[[Doctor Who]]'' entitled ''[[The Massacre of St Bartholomew's Eve]]'' is set during the events leading up to the Paris massacre. [[Leonard Sachs]] appeared as Admiral Coligny and Joan Young played Catherine de Medici. This serial is [[Doctor Who missing episodes|missing from the BBC archives]] and survives only in audio form.

The St Bartholomew's Day Massacre is the setting for [[Tim Willocks]]' historical novel, ''The Twelve Children of Paris'' (Matthias Tannhauser Trilogy:2) (2013), and  [[Ken Follett]]'s book [[A Column of Fire]], published in 2017. Follett gives several of the book's main characters a role in the massacre and the events leading up to it.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6114">In [[Sweden]], a common '''system for weights and measures''' was introduced by law in 1665. Before that, there were a number of local variants. The system was slightly revised in 1735. In 1855, a decimal reform was instituted that defined a new Swedish inch as {{frac|1|10}} Swedish foot ({{convert|2.96|cm |in|abbr=in|disp=or}}). Up to the middle of the 19th century, there was a law allowing the imposition of the [[death penalty]] for falsifying weights or measures. Sweden adopted the [[metric system]] in 1889. Only the [[Swedish mile]], ''mil'', has been preserved, now measuring {{convert|10|km|smi |abbr=off}}. 

== Length ==
The Swedish units of length included the following:
* ''aln'' – Forearm (cf. [[Ell]]) (pl. ''alnar''). After 1863, {{cvt|59.37|cm|ft}}. Before that, from 1605, 59.38 cm as defined by King [[Carl IX of Sweden]] in [[Norrköping]] 1604, based on ''Rydaholmsalnen''.
* ''famn'' – [[Fathom]], 3 ''alnar''.
* ''kvarter'' – Quarter, {{frac|1|4}} ''aln''
* ''fot'' – Foot, 1/2 ''aln''. Before 1863, the [[Stockholm]] ''fot'' was the commonly accepted unit, at {{cvt|29.69|cm |ft}}.
* ''linje'' – Line, after 1863 {{frac|1|10}} ''tum'', {{convert|2.96|mm |in|abbr=in}}. Before that, {{frac|1|12}} ''tum'' or 2.06 mm.
* ''mil'' – Mile, also ''lantmil''. From 1699, defined as a unity mile of 18000 ''alnar'' or {{cvt|10.69|km|smi}}. The unified mile was meant to define the suitable distance between inns. (The current [[Swedish mil]] is exactly 10 [[kilometer]]s.)
* ''nymil'' – New mile from 1889, 10 km exactly. Commonly used to this day, only referred to as ''mil''.
* ''kyndemil'' – The distance a torch will last, approx {{cvt|16|km|smi}}.
* ''skogsmil'' – Also ''rast'', distance between rests in the woods, approx. {{cvt|5|km|smi}}. 
* ''fjärdingsväg'' – {{frac|1|4}} ''mil''
* ''stenkast'' – Stone's throw, about {{cvt|50|m|0}}, used to this day as an approximate measure.
* ''rev'' – 160 ''fot'', for land measurement, was 100 ''fot'' after 1855.
* ''stång'' – 16 ''fot'', for land measurement
* ''tum'' – Thumb (inch), {{frac|1|12}} ''fot'', 2.474 cm. After 1863 {{frac|1|10}} ''fot'', 2.96 cm, not much accepted by professional users in mechanics and carpentry who later switched to English inch (2.54 cm, abandoned only late 20th century) and metric system.
* ''tvärhand'' – Hand, 4 inches.

== Area ==
* ''kannaland'' – 1000 ''fot''², or {{cvt|88.15|m2|sqft}}
* ''kappland'' – {{cvt|154.3|m2}}.
* ''spannland'' – 16 ''kappland''
* ''tunnland'' – 2 ''spannland'' or {{cvt|4,937.6|m2|sqft}}, about 1 acre
* ''kvadratmil'' – Square ''mil'', 36 million square ''favnar'', from 1739.

'''Turkey's media purge after the failed [[2016 Turkish coup d'état attempt|''coup d'état'' on July 15, 2016]]''' resulted in the shutdown of at least 131 media outlets&lt;ref name="cpj.org"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://cpj.org/blog/2016/07/turkey-crackdown-chronicle-week-of-july-24.php|title=Turkey Crackdown Chronicle: Week of July 24 - Committee to Protect Journalists|website=cpj.org|access-date=2016-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the arrest of 117 journalists&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://platform24.org/en/articles/395/journalists-in-state-of-emergency---17|title=Journalists in State of Emergency – 17|website=platform24.org|access-date=2016-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; – at least 35 of whom have been indicted for "membership in a terror group".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://cpj.org/blog/2016/08/turkey-crackdown-chronicle-week-of-august-28.php|title=Turkey Crackdown Chronicle: Week of August 28 - Committee to Protect Journalists|website=cpj.org|access-date=2016-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the wake of the attempted putsch, [[Recep Tayyip Erdoğan|President Recep Tayyip Erdogan]]'s government closed down media companies linked to exiled cleric [[Fethullah Gülen]] and his [[Hizmet|Hizmet Movement]]. Turkey's General Directorate for Press, Broadcasting, and Information also revoked at least 620 journalists' accreditations.

As a result of the crackdown, 2,308 media workers and journalists have lost their job.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/11/brothers-critical-turkish-regime-arrested-after-tv-programme|title=Brothers critical of Turkish government arrested after TV programme|last=Letsch|first=Constanze|date=2016-09-11|newspaper=The Guardian|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077|access-date=2016-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Turkey's media purge has also occurred online: regulators blocked at least 30 news-related websites.&lt;ref name="cpj.org"/&gt; Websites not linked to Gülen's movement, such as [[WikiLeaks|Wikileaks]] and the Turkish satirical weekly ''Leman'', are among those blocked inside Turkey.

== Chronology of Purge ==

On Thursday July 21, six days after the failed coup d’état, Turkey’s parliament approved a bill declaring a state of emergency allowing the government to rule by decree for three months.&lt;ref name="London"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/21/turkey-parliament-expected-to-pass-erdogan-emergency-measures|title=Turkey MPs approve state of emergency bill allowing rule by decree|last=London|first=Kareem Shaheen Owen Bowcott in|date=2016-07-21|newspaper=The Guardian|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077|access-date=2016-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the same day, Erdogan announced that the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] had been suspended.

Under the [[Constitution of Turkey|Turkish constitution]], during a state of emergency, the government can overturn the exercise of fundamental rights and freedoms, as long as it respects international laws.&lt;ref name="London"/&gt; However, the 15th article of the Turkish Constitution states that the ECHR cannot be suspended.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.allaboutturkey.com/constitution.htm|title=The Constitution - All About Turkey|website=www.allaboutturkey.com|access-date=2016-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In this context and that of a [[2016–17 purges in Turkey|a wider purge in Turkey]] with 40,000 arrests and 160,000 suspensions of officials,&lt;ref name="Reuters0430"/&gt; President Erdogan initiated a purge of media and journalists suspected of sympathy with the [[Gülen movement]]&lt;ref name="gulenwebsite"&gt;[http://www.gulenmovement.us/gulen-movement/what-is-the-gulen-movement Gulen's Hizmet movement]&lt;/ref&gt;. On July 27th, Erdogan published a decree in [[T.C.

== Reactions ==

Press freedom groups have condemned the crackdown. The Turkish representative for [[Reporters Without Borders]] called the arrests "a witch hunt against journalists".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/25/turkey-issues-arrest-warrants-42-journalists-attempted-coup|title=Turkey issues warrants for 42 journalists in relation to failed coup|last=Letsch|first=Constanze|date=2016-07-25|newspaper=The Guardian|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077|access-date=2016-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; David Kaye, the [[United Nations|UN]] special rapporteur on the right to freedom of expression said that "the attempted coup cannot justify such a broad attack against almost all voices, not just critical ones but analytic and journalistic."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=20319&amp;LangID=E|title=Freedom of expression: UN and OSCE experts deplore crackdown on journalists and media outlets in Turkey|website=www.ohchr.org|access-date=2016-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"The disregard for any assurance of due process is flagrant and only contributes to the extreme levels of insecurity affecting all those working to inform people of the ongoing crisis in the country,"&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  said Dunja Mijatović, the media freedom representative of the [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe|Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe]]’s representative on media freedom.

The [[Committee to Protect Journalists|Committee to Protect Journalist]]’s program coordinator for central Asia, Nina Ognianova, said that the "scale of this rout of the media is staggering." She added: "The government is exploiting a failed coup to silence the critical press when Turkey most needs pluralistic media."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://cpj.org/2016/07/turkey-shutters-more-than-100-media-outlets-as-pur.php|title=Turkey shutters more than 100 media outlets as purge continues - Committee to Protect Journalists|website=cpj.org|access-date=2016-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Turkey director at [[Human Rights Watch]], Emma Sinclair-Webb, added to the criticism "In the absence of any evidence of their role or participation in the violent attempt to overthrow the government, we strongly condemn this accelerated assault on the media, which further undermines Turkey’s democratic credentials", she said.&lt;ref name="Johnston"/&gt;

In [[sport]]s (particularly [[association football]]), a '''two-legged tie''' is a contest between two teams which comprises two matches or "legs", with each team as the [[home (sports)|home team]] in one leg.  The winning team is usually determined by [[aggregate score]], the sum of the scores of the two legs.  For example, if the scores of the two legs are:
*First leg: Team A 4–1 Team B
*Second leg: Team B 2–1 Team A
Then the aggregate score will be Team A 5–3 Team B, meaning team A wins the tie. In some competitions, a tie is considered to be [[tie (draw)|drawn]] if each team wins one leg, regardless of the aggregate score. Two-legged ties can be used in [[Single-elimination tournament|knockout cup competitions]] and [[playoffs]].

In North America, the equivalent term is '''''home-and-home series''''' or, if decided by aggregate, '''''two-game total-goals series'''''.

==Use==
In football, two-legged ties are used in the later stages of many international club tournaments, including the [[UEFA Champions League]] and the [[Copa Libertadores]]; in many domestic cup competitions, including the [[Coppa Italia]] and the [[Copa del Rey]]; in domestic league play-offs, including the [[Football League play-offs]] and the [[MLS Cup Playoffs]]; and in national-team playoffs in some qualification tournaments, including [[FIFA World Cup qualification]].

In [[ice hockey]], the [[National Hockey League]] used two-game, total-goals series in the early years of its playoffs.  It applied to all its playoffs from [[1917–18 NHL season|1918]] to [[1926–27 NHL season|1926]], and the early rounds until [[1936–37 NHL season|1937]], when it completed the switch to best-of-''n'' series. The [[NCAA Men's Ice Hockey Championship]] also used a two-game total goals format for much of its history.

In [[rugby union]], two-legged matches are used in the qualifying stages of the [[Rugby World Cup]]. The semifinals of the Italian [[Top12|National Championship of Excellence]] are also two-legged, as are the semifinals and final of England's second-tier league, the [[RFU Championship]].

In [[basketball]], the two top European club competitions, the [[Euroleague Basketball|Euroleague]] and [[Eurocup Basketball|Eurocup]], both use two-legged ties in the qualifying rounds that determine the clubs advancing to each competition's group phase. The Eurocup also uses two-legged ties in its quarterfinal round, which will be a separate phase of the competition starting in [[ULEB Eurocup 2009–10|2009–10]]. The French [[LNB Pro A|Pro A]] league used two-legged ties in all of its playoff rounds, except for the one-off final, until the 2006–07 season. At that time, all of its playoff rounds leading up to the final, which remained a single match through 2011–12, were changed to best-of-three series. The final changed to best-of-five starting in 2012–13.

In [[Gaelic football]], two-legged finals were used for five seasons of the [[National Football League (Ireland)|National Football League]], the last in [[1988–89 National Football League (Ireland)|1988–89]]. The [[International Rules Series]] was also two-legged in 1998–2013 and from 2017 onward.

In [[Canadian football]], two-legged total point series were occasionally used by the [[Canadian Football League]] and their predecessor leagues in the postseason, most recently in the [[1986 CFL season|1986 playoffs]].

In [[Arena football]], the playoff semifinals (but not the [[Arena Bowl]] itself) were decided, at least for the [[2018 Arena Football League season|2018 season]], by a two-legged total points playoff. In one semifinal, the first game ended in a tie, and went to overtime.  However, the winner of the second game won by a larger margin (within regulation time) and was awarded overall victory based on total aggregate points.

==Tiebreaking==
If the aggregate score is tied after the two legs, various methods can be used to break ties. Under the [[away goals rule]], the team who scored more away goals advances. If away goals are equal, or are not considered, then the tie may be decided by [[extra time]] and/or [[penalty shootout]]. [[Replay (sports)|Replays]], at the second-leg venue or a neutral venue, were formerly used in European club competitions.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web |url=http://www.rsssf.com/ec/ec196061.html#icfc |title=Inter-Cities Fairs Cup 1960-61 |last=Ross |first=James M. |date=27 June 2007 |work=[[RSSSF]] |accessdate=2009-03-26}}
&lt;/ref&gt;  In the ''Liguilla'' (playoffs) of the [[Primera División de México]], the team with the better regular-season record advances; some leagues take the two teams' record against one another into account. In the promotion playoffs in Italy's [[Serie B]] (which do not necessarily occur in a given season), two-legged ties that are level on aggregate at the end of regulation time of the second leg go to extra time (away goals are not used); if the tie remains level after extra time, the team that finished higher on the league table advances.

==Second leg home advantage==
Each team hosts one match, and there is no intended advantage to whether a team plays at home first or second. However, lots of managers and players believe that the team playing at home for the second leg has a slight advantage. The thinking is that the team playing away for the first leg can play it safe there (a draw or even a slight defeat is considered a favourable result), and then "win" the tie at home in the second leg.

A statistical analysis of roughly 12,000 matches from the European club competitions between 1956 and 2007 showed that around 53% of teams playing at home in the second leg won the tie (even after allowing for the fact that team playing at home in the second leg tend to be better teams).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/content~content=a781793320~db=all~tab=content~order=pubdate |title=The second leg home advantage: Evidence from European football cup competitions.}}
&lt;/ref&gt; This effect has however decreased over time.

In the case of World Cup intercontinental playoffs the team that plays the second leg at home has won 61% of ties.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://bitedge.com/blog/second-leg-home-advantage-in-world-cup-intercontinental-playoffs/|title=Second Leg Home Advantage In World Cup Intercontinental Playoffs|date=2017-09-09|work=Bitedge|access-date=2017-09-10|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alternatives==
In knockout competitions, alternatives to two-legged ties include: 
* single-leg ties,
** ''either'' where one team has home advantage, as in all rounds of the [[FA Cup]] except the semi-finals and finals. When a [[Replay (sports)|replay]] is necessary, it may be played at the home ground of the opposite team. Two-legged ties are seen as fairer, since they give neither team [[home advantage]]; conversely, in the [[National Football League]], home advantage is a reward for being the better [[seed (sports)|seed]] or, in the opening [[Wild card (sports)#National Football League|wild-card round]], winning the division.
** ''or'' played at a neutral venue, as in the final match of many tournaments, including the [[List of European Cup and UEFA Champions League winners|UEFA Champions League Final]], the [[FA Cup Semi-finals]] and [[FA Cup Final|Final]], and the NFL's [[Super Bowl]].  Neutral venues may be inconvenient for a team's fans to travel to, and due to this and the much higher prices for such a marquee event, a championship at a neutral site often draws a crowd of a much different nature than a crowd at a regular season contest. If the venue is picked before the teams playing are known, it is possible for the team that normally plays at the neutral venue to reach the match: an example is the [[1984 European Cup Final]] where [[Liverpool F.C.]] played [[A.S. Roma]] at the [[Stadio Olimpico]], Roma's home ground (despite this, Roma had been drawn as the technical away team for this match).
* [[Playoff format#Best-of formats|best-of-''n'' series]], where the team winning more matches wins the series. These are common in [[Major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada|major Canadian and American sports leagues]]; games cannot be drawn and series are best of 3, 5 or 7. Such series are typically structured with alternating home venues so that the higher-ranked team gets the extra game (if necessary).

'''''Walden Two''''' is a [[utopian novel]] written by [[Radical behaviorism|behavioral]] psychologist [[B. F. Skinner]], first published in 1948.  In its time, it could have been considered [[science fiction]], since science-based methods for altering people's behavior did not yet exist.&lt;ref&gt;Skinner, B.F. (1986).

==Synopsis==
The [[first-person narrator]] and [[protagonist]], Professor Burris, is a university instructor of psychology, who is approached by two young men (one a former student) sometime in the late 1940s. The young men are recent veterans of [[World War II]] and, intrigued by [[utopian]]ism, express interest in an old acquaintance of Burris, named T. E. Frazier, who in the 1930s started an [[intentional community]] that still thrives. Burris contacts Frazier, who invites them all to stay for several days to experience life in the supposedly utopian community. Venturing to the community, named Walden Two, the young men bring their girlfriends and Burris brings along a colleague named Professor Castle, who teaches philosophy and ethics.

The rest of the book proceeds largely as a [[novel of ideas]], mostly involving Frazier, a smug, talkative, and colorful character, guiding his new visitors around Walden Two and proudly explaining its socio-politico-economic structures and collectivist achievements. A wide range of intellectual topics such as [[behavioral modification]], [[political ethics]], [[educational philosophy]], [[sexual equality]] (specifically, advocacy for [[women in the workforce]]), the [[common good]], [[historiography]], [[political freedom|freedom]] and [[free will]], the [[problem of free will|dilemma of determinism]], [[fascism]], [[American democracy]], and [[Soviet communism]] are discussed and often debated among the self-satisfied Frazier, the skeptical and doubting Castle, and the quietly intrigued Burris.

In effect, Walden Two operates using a flexible design, by continually testing the most successful, evidence-based strategies in order to organize the community. Frazier argues that Walden Two thus avoids the way that most societies collapse or grow dysfunctional: by remaining dogmatically rigid in their politics and social structure. He verifies Walden Two's success by pointing to its members' overall sense of happiness and freedom&amp;mdash;thanks in part to a program of "[[behavioral engineering]]" begun at birth. Despite these behavior-guiding procedures during childhood, the adults of Walden Two indeed appear to be legitimately peaceful, productive, and happy people; they also appear to govern the course of their own lives.

Frazier delightedly explains that Walden Two's decision-making system is not authoritarian, anarchic, or even democratic. Except for a small fluctuating group of community organizers, called Planners (temporarily including Frazier), Walden Two has no real governing body; certainly, the Planners have no power to exercise violent force on the community, a feature that Frazier often praises. Each member of the community is apparently self-motivated, with an amazingly relaxed work schedule of only four average hours of work a day, directly supporting the common good and accompanied by the freedom to select a fresh new place to work each day. The members then use the large remainder of their  time to engage in creative or recreational activities of their own choosing. The only money is a simple system of points that buys greater leisure periods in exchange for less desirable labor. Members automatically receive ample food and sleep, with higher needs met by nurturing one's artistic, intellectual, and athletic interests, ranging from music to literature and from chess to tennis. 

As Burris and the other visitors tour the grounds, they discover that certain radically unusual customs have been established in Walden Two, quite bizarre to the American mainstream, but showing apparent success in the long run. Some of these customs include that children are raised communally, families are non-nuclear, free affection is the norm, and personal expressions of thanks are taboo. Such behavior is mandated by the community's individually self-enforced "Walden Code", a guideline for self-control techniques, which encourages members to credit all individual and other achievements to the larger community, while requiring minimal strain. [[Community counselors]] are also available to supervise behavior and assist members with better understanding and following the Code.

Excitedly, two of the young visitors sign up and are soon admitted as permanent members. Castle, though, has fostered a growing hunch that Frazier is somehow presenting a sham society or is in fact, secretly, a dictator. Defending the virtues of democracy, Castle finally confronts Frazier directly, accusing him of [[despotism]], though he has no definitive proof. Frazier rebuts, on the contrary, that the vision for Walden Two is as a place safe from all forms of despotism, even the "despotism of democracy". 

At some points, Frazier and Burris have pleasant talks in private, with Frazier revealing that other communities loosely associated with Walden Two have now cropped up, the most recent being Walden Six. Although enticed by Walden Two's obvious success as a peaceful community, Burris finds it difficult to look past Frazier's irritating pride and boastfulness about the community. During one conversation, Frazier admits to being boastful, but argues that his personality should not influence Burris's opinion of Walden Two and his own observations. By the end of their stay, the remaining visitors leave the community in a mostly impressed state of wonder, except for Castle, who has stubbornly settled on the idea that, somehow, Frazier is a scoundrel and the community is fraudulent. 

During the visitors' trip back to the university, Burris ultimately decides in an inspired moment that he wishes to fully embrace the Walden Two lifestyle. Quickly abandoning his professorial post, Burris travels back in a long and spiritually satisfying journey on foot; he is welcomed once again to Walden Two with open arms.

==The community==
The novel describes "an experimental community called Walden Two".&lt;ref&gt;Skinner, B. F. (1985). [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2741768/pdf/behavan00064-0007.pdf "News From Nowhere, 1984"]. ''The Behavior Analyst,'' '''8'''(1), pp. 5–14. "My name is Burris. I live in an experimental community called Walden Two". p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Altus"&gt;Altus, Deborah E., and Morris, Edward K. (2009). [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2778813/pdf/bhan-32-02-319.pdf "B. F. Skinner's Utopian Vision: Behind and Beyond ''Walden Two''"]. ''The Behavior Analyst,'' '''32'''(2), pp. 319–335. B. F. Skinner regarded ''Walden Two'' as his "book about an experimental community". p. 320.&lt;/ref&gt; The community is located in a rural area and "has nearly a thousand members".&lt;ref&gt;''Walden Two,'' p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; The community encourages its members "to view every habit and custom with an eye to possible improvement" and to have "a constantly experimental attitude toward everything".&lt;ref&gt;''Walden Two,'' p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt; The culture of Walden Two can be changed if experimental evidence favors proposed changes. The community emulates (on a communal scale) the [[simple living]] and [[self-sufficiency]] that [[Henry David Thoreau]] practiced (on an individual scale) at [[Walden Pond]], as described in his 1854 book ''[[Walden]]''. Walden Two engages in behavioral engineering of young children that aims toward cooperative relationships and the erasure of competitive sentiments. The community has also dissolved the [[nuclear family]] through placing the responsibility of child-rearing in the hands of the larger community and not just the child's parents or immediate family.

==Community governance==
Walden Two consists of four loose classes or groupings of people by occupation (though they are not akin to strict [[economic class]]es): ''Planners'', ''Managers'', ''Workers'', and ''Scientists''. Walden&amp;nbsp;Two has a constitution that provides for a “''Board of Planners''”, which is Walden&amp;nbsp;Two’s “only government”,&lt;ref name="Walden Two, p. 48"&gt;''Walden Two,'' p.&amp;nbsp;48.&lt;/ref&gt; though the power they wield only amounts to that, approximately, of community organizers. The “Board of Planners” was conceived of while Walden&amp;nbsp;Two was still in its earliest theoretical stages, and there are “six Planners, usually three men and three women”,&lt;ref name="Walden Two, p. 48"/&gt; who are “charged with the success of the community. They make policies, review the work of the Managers (heads of each area of labor), keep an eye on the state of the nation in general. They also have certain judicial functions.”&lt;ref name="Walden Two, p. 48"/&gt; A Planner “may serve for ten years, but no longer.”&lt;ref name="Walden Two, p. 48"/&gt; A vacancy on the Board of Planners is filled by the Board "from a pair of names supplied by the Managers".&lt;ref name="Walden Two, p. 48"/&gt; Furthermore, the Walden&amp;nbsp;Two constitution “can be changed by a unanimous vote of the Planners and a two-thirds vote of the Managers”.&lt;ref&gt;''Walden Two,'' p.&amp;nbsp;254.&lt;/ref&gt;

Frazier and five other people constitute the current Board of Planners during Burris’s visit to Walden&amp;nbsp;Two. Planners hold office in staggered, limited terms. They do not rule with any kind of force and are so extremely opposed to creating a [[cult of personality]], system of favoritism, or other possibilities for corruption going against the common good that they do not even publicly announce their office, and, likewise, most of the community members do not bother to know the Planners' identities. Due to this and also as a result of this, the Planners live as modestly as the other members of the community; ostentatious displays of wealth and status simply have no opportunity to arise from Walden&amp;nbsp;Two’s [[egalitarian]] cultural structure.

Managers, meanwhile, are “specialists in charge of the divisions and services of Walden&amp;nbsp;Two”.&lt;ref name="Walden Two, p. 48"/&gt; A member of the community can “work up to be a Manager – through intermediate positions which carry a good deal of responsibility and provide the necessary apprenticeship”.&lt;ref name="Walden Two, p. 49"&gt;''Walden Two'', p.&amp;nbsp;49.&lt;/ref&gt; The Managers are not elected by the members of Walden Two in any kind of democratic process.&lt;ref name="Walden Two, p. 49"/&gt; The method of selecting Managers is not specified, though they are likely appointed by the Board of Planners.

The regular community members are known (though only for official reasons) as Workers, and they have the flexible option of changing their field and location of employment every single day, so as not to grow bored or stagnant during the week with their four-on-average daily hours of work. Available work often includes the necessary physical labor that goes into maintaining a community, such as basic building or repairing projects, cleaning duties, or agricultural work. Labor in Walden&amp;nbsp;Two operates using a simple point system of units called “credits”, in which more menial or unpleasant jobs (such as waste management) earn a Worker a higher number of credits than more relaxing or interesting jobs, ultimately allowing more free time for that Worker.

The final grouping within Walden&amp;nbsp;Two is the Scientists, who conduct experiments “in plant and animal breeding, the control of infant behavior, educational processes of several sorts, and the use of some of [Walden Two’s] raw materials”.&lt;ref&gt;''Walden Two'', pp.&amp;nbsp;49–50.&lt;/ref&gt; Scientists are the least discussed group in the novel; little is said about the selection, total number, specific duties, or methods of the Scientists, though they presumably carry out the ongoing social experiments that help determine the most beneficial social strategies for the community.

==Thoreau's ''Walden''==
''Walden&amp;nbsp;Two'''s title is a direct reference to [[Henry David Thoreau]]’s book ''[[Walden]]''. In the novel, the Walden&amp;nbsp;Two Community is mentioned as having the benefits of living in a place like Thoreau’s Walden, but “with company”. It is, as the book says, ‘Walden for two’ – meaning a place for achieving personal self-actualization, but within a vibrant community, rather than in a place of solitude. Originally, Skinner indicated that he wanted to title it ''The Sun is but a Morning Star'', a quote of the last sentence of Thoreau’s ''Walden'',&lt;ref name=morningstar&gt;{{cite book |author=Thoreau, Henry David |year=1854 |url=https://archive.org/details/waldenorlifeinwo1854thor |title=Walden; or, Life in the woods |location=Boston, Massachusetts |publisher=[[Ticknor and Fields]] |quote=The sun is but a morning star. |page=357}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the publishers suggested the current title as an alternative.

In theory and in practice, Thoreau’s Walden Pond experiment and the fictive Walden&amp;nbsp;Two experiment were far different from one another: For instance, Thoreau’s book ''Walden'' espouses the virtues of self-reliance at the individual level, while ''Walden&amp;nbsp;Two'' espouses
# the virtues of self-reliance at the community level, and
# Skinner’s underlying premise that free will of the individual is weak&lt;br/&gt;compared to how environmental conditions [[Shaping (psychology)|shape]] behavior.

The cover of ''Walden Two'', shown above, includes an ‘O’ filled with yellow ink, with yellow lines radiating from the center of the ‘O’. That Sun-like ‘O’ is an allusion to the proposition that ''The sun is but a morning star''.&lt;ref name=morningstar/&gt;

==''News From Nowhere, 1984''==
Skinner published a follow-up to ''Walden Two'' in an essay titled ''News From Nowhere, 1984''. It details the discovery of Eric Blair in the community who seeks out and meets Burris, confessing his true identity as [[George Orwell]]. Blair seeks out Frazier as the 'leader' and the two have discussions which comprise the essay. Blair was impressed by Walden Two's "lack of any institutionalized government, religion, or economic system", a state of affairs that embodied "the dream of nineteenth-century [[anarchism]]".&lt;ref&gt;Skinner, B.F. (1985). [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2741768/pdf/behavan00064-0007.pdf "News From Nowhere, 1984"]. ''The Behavior Analyst,'' '''8'''(1), p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

Twin Oaks is detailed in [[Kat Kinkade]]'s book, ''A Walden Two experiment: The first five years of Twin Oaks Community''.&lt;ref&gt;Kinkade, Kathleen (1973). ''A Walden Two experiment: The first five years of Twin Oaks Community''. [[William Morrow and Company]]. {{ISBN|0-688-00020-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Originally started as a Walden Two community, it has since rejected its Walden Two position, however it still uses its modified Planner-Manager system as well as a system of labor credits based on the book.

Los Horcones does not use the Planner-Manager governance system described in ''Walden Two.''  They refer to their governance system as a "personocracy".&lt;ref&gt;Comunidad Los Horcones (February 25, 2012). [http://directory.ic.org/715/Comunidad_Los_Horcones "Communities Directory"]. [[Fellowship for Intentional Community]], Retrieved August 23, 2012. "We value the participation of all members in decision making.

==Cultural engineering==
Skinner wrote about cultural engineering in at least two books, devoting a chapter to it in both ''Science and Human Behavior'' and ''[[Beyond Freedom and Dignity]]''. In ''Science and Human Behavior''&lt;ref&gt;Skinner, B.F. (1953). [http://www.bfskinner.org/BFSkinner/PDFBooksSHB_files/Science_and_Human_Behavior_1.pdf ''Science and Human Behavior''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130108010009/http://www.bfskinner.org/bfskinner/PDFBooksSHB_files/Science_and_Human_Behavior_1.pdf |date=2013-01-08 }}, Chapter XXVIII: "Designing a Culture". Cambridge, Massachusetts: B.F. Skinner Foundation. Paperback edition: [[Free Press (publisher)|Free Press]] (March 1, 1965). {{ISBN|0029290406}}, {{ISBN|978-0029290408}}.&lt;/ref&gt; a chapter is titled "Designing a Culture" and expands on this position as well as in other documents. In ''Beyond Freedom and Dignity'' there are many indirect references to ''Walden Two'' when describing other cultural designs.

==Criticisms==
Hilke Kuhlmann's ''Living Walden Two'' possesses many subtle and not-so-subtle criticisms of the original ''Walden Two'' which are related to the actual efforts that arose from the novel. One criticism is that many of the founders of real-life Walden Twos identified with, or wanted to emulate, Frazier, the uncharismatic and implicitly despotic founder of the community.

In a critique of ''Walden Two,'' Harvey L. Gamble, Jr. asserted that Skinner's "fundamental thesis is that individual traits are shaped from above, by social forces that create the environment", and that Skinner's goal "is to create a frictionless society where individuals are properly socialized to function with others as a unit", and to thus "make the community [Walden Two] into a perfectly efficient [[anthill]]".&lt;ref&gt;Gamble, Harvey L., Jr., (1999). [http://www.accessmylibrary.com/article-1G1-54552225/walden-two-postmodern-utopia.html "''Walden Two,'' Postmodern Utopia, and the Problems of Power, Choice, and the Rule of Law".] ''Texas Studies in Literature and Language,'' 41(1), p. 3. Retrieved September 19, 2009 from accessmylibrary.com&lt;/ref&gt; Gamble writes, "We find at the end of ''Walden Two'' that Frazier [a founding member of Walden Two]... has sole control over the political system and its policies. It is he who regulates food, work, education, and sleep, and who sets the moral and economic agenda." However, contrary to Gamble's critique, it should be noted that neither Frazier nor any other person has the ''sole'' power to amend the constitution of Walden Two.  See the "Community governance" section, above.

There are several varieties of behaviorism but only Skinner’s radical behaviorism, has proposed to redesign society. The relevant principles were expounded at length two decades later in a best-seller ''Beyond Freedom and Dignity'' (1971).

''Walden Two'' was criticized in John Staddon's ''The New Behaviorism''.&lt;ref&gt;Staddon, John (2014)  ''The New Behaviorism'' (2nd edition)  Philadelphia, PA: Psychology Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Skinner thought ''Walden Two'' an accomplishment comparable to two science-fiction classics: [[Aldous Huxley]]’s ''[[Brave New World]]'' (1931) and [[George Orwell]]’s ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'' (1949).  He assigned all three in his Nat Sci 114 introductory psychology course at Harvard.  There is some irony in Skinner’s choice, because Orwell’s and Huxley’s novels are both dystopias.  They portray not the supposed benefits of a technological approach to human society, but the evil consequences of either coercive (''Nineteen Eighty-Four'') or stealthy (''Brave New World'') efforts to control or gentle human beings.  On the contrary, ''Walden Two'' is supposed to light the technological path to utopia.

Skinner’s Walden proposal is in a tradition that goes back to Plato’s philosopher king: a ‘legislator’ (monarch) and a set of guardians who are wiser than the common people.  The guardians “are to be a class apart, like the Jesuits in old Paraguay, the ecclesiastics in the States of the Church until 1870 and the Communist Party in the U.S.S.R. at the present day,” wrote [[Bertrand Russell]], one of Skinner’s heroes, in 1946.   Not too different from Walden Two’s Managers and Planners, and Frazier, Skinner’s avatar and leader of the community.  Skinner was quite explicit about the need for technocratic rule: “We must delegate control of the population as a whole to specialists – to police, priests, teachers, therapies, and so on, with their specialized reinforcers and their codified contingencies.”&lt;ref&gt;''Beyond freedom and dignity'', 1971, August Psychology Today 37-81&lt;/ref&gt;
