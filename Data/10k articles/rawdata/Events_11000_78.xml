      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3978">The '''2008 Zanzibar Power blackout''' was an extensive [[power outage]] on [[Zanzibar]], [[Tanzania]].

A similar and longer event happened in Zanzibar in 2009. The island was without power for more than three months.

During May and June 2008, Zanzibar suffered a period of almost one month without [[mains electricity]] due to a grid failure which left the entire island dependent on alternative methods of electricity generation (mainly diesel generators). Power failed on 21 May 2008 after a wide-area grid failure across the Tanzanian network was followed by a power surge which damaged the submarine interconnector cable that links the Tanzanian mainland and Zanzibar.&lt;ref name="africa.reuters.com"&gt;{{cite news | url = http://africa.reuters.com/business/news/usnBAN523622.html | title = Zanzibar without power for another 4 weeks | agency = [[Reuters]] | date = 5 June 2008 | access-date = 2008-06-06 | archive-url = https://archive.is/20130201132939/http://africa.reuters.com/business/news/usnBAN523622.html | archive-date = 2013-02-01 | dead-url = yes | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The power was eventually restored on 19 June 2008, however, concerns remained about the fragility of the island's transmission infrastructure, its near total dependence on the mainland for its electricity generation, and the capacity and condition of the ageing interconnector that links the mainland electricity network and the island grid.

==Effects==
[[Tourism in Zanzibar]], the main income generating activity on the islands, was seriously disrupted by the outage.&lt;ref name="africa.reuters.com"/&gt; Other important industries, including the [[Zanzibar Electric Company]] and independent small businesses were "severely hit" by the blackout.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7427957.stm | title = Melting in Zanzibar's blackout | publisher = [[BBC News]] | date = 30 May 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7423444.stm | title = Week-long blackout hurts Zanzibar | publisher = [[BBC News]] | date = 28 May 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The island's semi-autonomous government was criticized for its lack of preparedness and dependence on power from mainland Tanzania.&lt;ref name="africa.reuters.com"/&gt; 

==Recurrence in 2009==
On 10 December 2009, Zanzibar was again plunged into darkness because of failure of the undersea cable. On 23 December 2009, the Isles Minister of Energy and Construction, [[Mansour Yussuf Himid]], was quoted in the Daily News newspaper published in Dar es Salaam as saying that the blackout would last until the end of February&lt;ref&gt;[http://nz.news.yahoo.com/a/-/entertainment/6647317/month-long-power-outage-threatens-zanzibar-tourism/ Yahoo! New Zealand News&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718135839/http://nz.news.yahoo.com/a/-/entertainment/6647317/month-long-power-outage-threatens-zanzibar-tourism/ |date=July 18, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; while a critical spare part known as a "splitter" was being sourced from overseas. He was also quoted as saying that the undersea cable was dilapidated and needed to be replaced entirely.

The undersea cable had a projected working life of 25 years when laid in 1976. It has now served for almost 35 years, ten years after it was due to be replaced.

The power in Zanzibar was restored in March, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.iol.co.za/index.php?set_id=1&amp;click_id=87art_id=nw20100309082917311C547461 |title=Archived copy |access-date=2010-11-26 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100821113237/http://www.iol.co.za/index.php?set_id=1 |archive-date=2010-08-21 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''A Tale of Two Kitties''''' is a 1942 ''[[Merrie Melodies]]'' [[cartoon]] directed by [[Bob Clampett]]. This short subject is notable for being [[Tweety Bird]]'s debut, although known as Orson in this short, according to the staff. written by [[Warren Foster]], and features music by [[Carl W. Stalling]]. It was also the first appearance of [[Babbit and Catstello]], based on the popular comedy duo [[Abbott and Costello]]. The title is an obvious pun on the [[Charles Dickens]] classic, ''[[A Tale of Two Cities]]''.

Even in this initial appearance, Tweety reveals early on that his [[cuteness|cute]] appearance masks a willingness to be merciless, even sadistic, towards anyone who threatens him. After slipping one of the cats a [[bomb]] which explodes (offscreen), the bird remarks, "Aw, da poor putty tat - he cwushed his widdow head!" Followed by a big grin. (This line was patterned after a catchphrase from a [[Red Skelton]] character, and would be used in other Warner cartoons, such as ''[[Easter Yeggs]]''.) This is one of the few Tweety shorts that did not feature his main antagonist [[Sylvester the Cat|Sylvester]], who would not make his official debut until 1945, in ''[[Life with Feathers]]''.

[[United Artists]] failed to renew the copyright in time in 1970, so the short is now in the public domain in the United States. As such, it can also be found on bootleg home video VHS, DVD, and Blu-ray sets.

'''Anticipatory grief''' refers to a feeling of [[grief]] occurring before an impending loss. Typically, the impending loss is the [[death]] of someone close due to illness. This can be experienced by dying individuals themselves&lt;ref name=NCI&gt;{{Cite web | title = Types of Grief Reactions | publisher = National Cancer Institute | url = http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/pdq/supportivecare/bereavement/HealthProfessional/page4 | accessdate = 12 June 2010}}
&lt;/ref&gt;  and can also be felt due to non-death-related losses like a scheduled [[mastectomy]], pending [[divorce]], company downsizing or [[war]].

== Stages ==
The five stages namely, [[denial]], [[anger]], [[bargaining]], [[Depression (mood)|depression]], and [[acceptance]] proposed by [[Elisabeth Kübler-Ross]] in her [[Kübler-Ross model|model of grief]] describe the process by which people undergo after a loss. Anxiety, dread, guilt, helplessness, hopelessness, and feelings of being overwhelmed are also common.  However, it is important to note that anticipatory grief is not simply normal grief begun earlier.&lt;ref name=NCI/&gt;

== Identifying features ==
Features identified specifically with anticipatory grief include heightened concern for the dying person, rehearsal of the death and attempts to adjust to the consequences of the death.  The period can allow people to resolve issues with the dying person and to say goodbye.&lt;ref name=NCI /&gt;  It may provide some sense of orientation and access to the grieving process. For some, it prompts conscious closure before the end/loss.&lt;ref name=Allen&gt;{{Cite web | last = Allen, J | title = The Long Road: An Article on Anticipatory Grief | url = http://www.jenniferallenbooks.com/grief/pdf/longroad.pdf | accessdate = 10 June 2010 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120222111722/http://www.jenniferallenbooks.com/grief/pdf/longroad.pdf |archivedate = 22 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Grief happening prior to a loss presents a compounding issue of isolation because of a lack of social acceptance. Anticipatory grief doesn't usually take the place of post-loss grief: there is not a fixed amount of grief to be experienced, so grief experienced before the loss does not necessarily reduce grief after the death.&lt;ref name=NCI/&gt;  However, there may be little grieving after the loss due to anticipatory grief.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|chapter=22|page=920|title=The Lippincott Manual of Nursing Practice|author=Lillian Brunner|publisher=J.B. Lippincott Company|isbn=978-0-397-54499-8|year=1986}}&lt;/ref&gt;

How often anticipatory grief occurs is a subject of some controversy.  For example, a study of widows found that they stayed with their husbands until the death and could only mourn once the death had occurred.  Researchers suggest that to start to grieve as though the loss has already happened can leave the bereaved feeling guilt for partially abandoning the patient.&lt;ref name=NCI/&gt;

Many family members can find themselves in a caregiving role during their loved one's process of death. During the progression of the illness, the security and protectiveness of the caregiver also increases. Bouchal, Rallison and Sinclair discuss that, "the strong need to offer protection was part of the anticipatory mourning experience of striving to be with in the present".&lt;ref name="Bouchal et al., 2015"&gt;Raffin Bouchal, S., Rallison, L., Moules, N., Sinclair, S. (2015). Holding On and Letting Go: Families' Experiences of Anticipatory Mourning in Terminal Cancer. OMEGA – Journal of Death and Dying. 72(1), 42-68. DOI: 10.1177/0030222815574700&lt;/ref&gt;

In the process of anticipatory grief, family members also begin to prepare and reflect on how their lives will be once their loved one passes. There are many ways in which to perform reflection. These ways include: "...reading, journaling, thinking, and reflecting about how life might be like without their partner." The journal also expands on the premise that the preparation process is not an individual process. Those who are affected by the impending death often look towards one another for support as well as others who are involved in care such as nurses and social workers.&lt;ref name="Bouchal et al., 2015" /&gt;

A direct correlation exists between anticipatory grieving and the caregiver's quality of life. In a quantitative study conducted by Al-Gamal and Long, the effect of a pediatric cancer diagnosis on parents had a negative impact on the majority of study participants. More specifically, parents reported experiencing increasing stress and a decrease in physical and mental health – all of which affect the process of anticipatory grief.&lt;ref&gt;Al-Gamal, E., Long, T. (2010). Anticipatory grieving among parents living with a child with cancer. Journal of Advanced Nursing, 66(9), 1980-1990. DOI: 10.1111/j.1365-2648.2010.05381.x&lt;/ref&gt;

Ultimately, anticipatory grieving is an extremely dynamic process that differs between individuals. The outcomes of the grieving process depend on the preparation of death and the anticipatory grief process.

The '''Avar–Byzantine wars''' were a series of conflicts between the [[Byzantine Empire]] and the [[Avar Khaganate]]. The conflicts were initiated in 568, after the Avars arrived in [[Pannonia]], and claimed all the former land of the [[Gepids]] and [[Lombards]] as their own. This led to them attempting to seize the city of [[Sirmium]] from Byzantium, which had previously retaken it from the Gepids, without success. Most of their future conflicts came as a result of raids by the Avars, or their subject Slavs, into the Balkan provinces of the Byzantine Empire.

The Avars usually raided the Balkans when the Byzantine Empire was distracted elsewhere, typically in its [[Byzantine–Sasanian wars|frequent wars]] with the [[Sassanid Empire]] in the East. As a result, they often raided with impunity for long periods of time, before Byzantine troops could be freed from other fronts to be sent on punitive expeditions. This happened during in the 580s and 590s, where Byzantium was initially distracted in the [[Byzantine–Sasanian War of 572–591]], but then followed up by a [[Maurice's Balkan campaigns|series of successful campaigns]] that pushed the Avars back.

==Background==
{{main article|Pannonian Avars|Avar Khaganate}}
The [[Pannonian Avars|Avars]] arrived in the [[Carpathian Basin]] in 568, fleeing from the [[Turkic Khaganate]]. They quickly entered into an alliance with the [[Lombards]] to seize the land of the [[Gepids]]. However, during this process, the Lombards retreated to [[Italy]], allowing the Avars to take both the lands of the Gepids and the former lands of the Lombards for themselves, creating the [[Avar Khaganate]]. The Avars then claimed all former territory of both as their own territory. This included [[Sirmium]], which had been recently reconquered by the Byzantines from the Gepids, and would serve as the first cause of conflict between the Avars and the Byzantines.{{sfn|Petersen|2013|p=378}}

The Avars were heavily dependent upon the skills and labor of their subject peoples for both [[siege warfare]] and [[logistics]]. Subject peoples, such as the [[early Slavs]] and the Huns, had long traditions of engineering and craftsmanship, such as the building of boats and bridges, and the use of [[Battering ram|rams]], [[Testudo formation|tortoise formations]], and [[Siege artillery|artillery]] in sieges. In every documented use of siege engines by the Avars, the Avars depended upon subject peoples who had knowledge of them, usually the [[Sabir people|Sabirs]], [[Kutrigurs]], or Slavs. Avar military tactics also relied upon speed and shock.{{sfn|Petersen|2013|pp=379–382}}

==Avar attacks on Sirmium (568–582)==
The Avars almost immediately launched an attack on Sirmium in 568, but were repulsed. The Avars withdrew their troops back to their own territory, but allegedly sent 10,000 [[Kutrigurs|Kotrigur Huns]],{{sfn|Petersen|2013|p=378}} a people who like the Avars had been forced into the Carpathians by the Turkic Khaganate,{{sfn|Golden|2011|p=140}} to invade the Byzantine province of [[Dalmatia]]. They then began a period of consolidation, during which the Byzantines paid them 80,000 gold [[Solidus (coin)|solidi]] a year.{{sfn|Mitchell|2007|p=405}} Except for a raid on Sirmium in 574,{{sfn|Petersen|2013|p=378}} they did not threaten Byzantine territory until 579, after Tiberius II stopped the payments.{{sfn|Mitchell|2007|p=405}} The Avars retaliated with [[Siege of Sirmium|another siege of Sirmium]].{{sfn|Petersen|2013|pp=378–379}} The city fell in {{circa|581}}, or possibly 582. After the capture of Sirmium, the Avars demanded 100,000 solidi a year.{{sfn|Mitchell|2007|p=406}}
Refused, they began pillaging the northern and eastern Balkans, which only ended after the Avars were pushed back by the Byzantines from 597 to 602.{{sfn|Petersen|2013|p=379}}

==Avar offensive in the Balkans (582–591)==
[[File:Balkans 6th century.svg|thumb|A map of the Northern Balkans in the 6th century.]]
After capturing Sirmium, the Avars began to rapidly encroach into the Balkans.{{sfn|Petersen|2013|p=381}} Their rapid spread was helped by the ongoing [[Byzantine–Sasanian War of 572–591]], which left the Byzantine garrisons on the Danube frontier under-manned and underpaid. Because of this, the Avars and Slavs were able to raid with impunity, with the Byzantines only being able to harass raiding columns and set small ambushes, rather than forcing a decisive victory or launching a counteroffensive.{{sfn|Crawford|2013|p=25}} The Avars took the cities of [[Augustae]], [[Singidunum]], and [[Viminacium]] in 583, and a further eight of the nine cities they besieged in 586. Many of these sieges relied upon the Avars utilizing both surprise and speed, advantages which they lost after they moved further inland in 587. Nevertheless they destroyed many cities in [[Moesia]] in 587 including [[Marcianopolis]] and [[Kabile]] though they failed in the sieges of [[Diocletianopolis (Thrace)|Diocletianopolis]], [[Plovdiv|Philippopolis]], and [[Stara Zagora|Beroe]]. In 588, they abandoned the siege of Singidunum after only seven days, in exchange for a meagre ransom. After this they succeeded at the siege of [[Pomorie|Anchialos]], with the support of a fleet manned by Slavic auxiliaries, they then started and quickly abandoned the sieges of [[Drizipara|Drizipera]] and [[Tzurullon]].{{sfn|Petersen|2013|p=381}} The Avars and Slavs continued to raid with little resistance until 591, when Emperor Maurice won the war with the Sassanids, and shifted his focus to the Balkans.{{sfn|Crawford|2013|p=25}}

==Byzantine offensive (591–595)==
{{main article|Maurice's Balkan campaigns}}
After the end of the Byzantine war with the Sassanids in 591, Emperor Maurice shifted his focus to the Balkans. Maurice deployed veteran troops to the Balkans, allowing the Byzantines to shift from a reactive strategy to a pre-emptive one.{{sfn|Crawford|2013|p=25}} The general [[Priscus (general)|Priscus]] was tasked with stopping the Slavs from crossing the Danube in spring 593. He routed several raiding parties, before he crossed the Danube and fought the Slavs in what is now [[Wallachia]] until autumn. Maurice ordered him to make camp on the northern bank of the Danube, however Priscus instead retired to [[Varna|Odessos]]. Priscus' retreat allowed for a new Slav incursion in late 593/594 in [[Moesia]] and Macedonia, with the towns of [[Aquis]], [[Scupi]] and [[Zaldapa]] being destroyed.{{Sfn|Whitby|1998|p=159f}}

In 594 Maurice replaced Priscus with his own brother, [[Peter (curopalates)|Peter]]. Due to his inexperience, Peter suffered initial failures, but eventually managed to repulse the tide of Slav and Avar incursions. He set up base at [[Marcianopolis]], and patrolled the Danube between [[Novae]] and the [[Black Sea]]. In late August of 594, he crossed the Danube near [[Securisca]] and fought his way to the [[Ialomița (river)|Helibacia river]], preventing the Slavs and Avars from preparing new pillaging campaigns.{{sfn|Whitby|1998|p=160f}} Priscus, who had been given command of another army, prevented the Avars from besieging Singidunum in 595, in combination with the [[Classis Histrica|Byzantine Danube fleet]]. After this, the Avars shifted their focus to Dalmatia, where they sacked several fortresses, and avoided confronting Priscus directly. Priscus was not particularly concerned about the Avar incursion, as Dalmatia was a remote and poor province; he sent only a small force to check their invasion, keeping the main body of his forces near the Danube. The small force was able to hamper the Avar advance, and even recovered a part of the loot taken by the Avars.{{sfn|Whitby|1998|p=161}}

==First interlude (595–597)==
After being hampered in their invasion of Dalmatia, the Avars were discouraged by their lack of success against the Byzantines, and thus began to make their raids against the [[Franks]], who they saw as being easier to attack, launching major raids against them in 596. Due to the shift in focus, there was little activity in the Balkans from 595 to 597.{{sfn|Whitby|1998|pp=161–162}}

==Avar invasion (597–602)==
Emboldened by the plunder from the Franks, the Avars resumed their raids across the Danube in autumn of 597, catching the Byzantines by surprise. The Avars even caught Priscus' army while it was still in its camp in [[Constanța|Tomis]], and laid siege to it. However, they lifted the siege on 30 March 598 due to an approaching Byzantine army led by [[Comentiolus]], which had just crossed [[Haemus Mons|Mount Haemus]] and was marching along the Danube up to [[Zikidiba]], only {{convert|30|km|mi|0}} from Tomis.{{sfn|Whitby|1998|p=162}} For unknown reasons, Priscus did not join Comentiolus when he pursued the Avars. Comentiolus made camp at [[Nădrag|Iatrus]], however he was routed by the Avars, and his troops had to fight their way back over the Haemus. The Avars took advantage of this victory and advanced to Drizipera, near Constantinople. At Drizipera the Avar forces were struck by a [[epidemic|plague]], leading to the death of a large portion of their army, and seven sons of [[Bayan I|Bayan]], the Avar Khagan.{{sfn|Whitby|1998|pp=162–163}}

Due to the threat posed by the Avar forces at Drizipera, Comentiolus was replaced with [[Philippicus (general)|Philippicus]], and recalled to Constantinople.{{sfn|Pohl|2002|p=153}} Maurice assembled a force made up of the [[Chariot racing#Byzantine era|Circus Factions]] and his bodyguards to defend the [[Anastasian Wall]].{{sfn|Whitby|1998|p=163}} Maurice then paid off the Avars for a temporary truce,{{sfn|Whitby|1998|p=162}} spending the rest of 598 reorganizing his forces and analyzing how to improve the Byzantines' strategy.{{sfn|Whitby|1998|p=163}} In the same year, the Byzantines concluded a peace treaty with the Avars, which allowed the Byzantines to send expeditions into [[Wallachia]].{{sfn|Pohl|2002|p=154}}

Ignoring the peace treaty, the Byzantines made preparations to invade the Avars' land. Priscus made camp near Singidunum and wintered there in 598/599. In 599 Priscus and Comentiolus led their troops downstream to Viminacium, and crossed the Danube. Once on the north bank, they defeated the Avars in the [[Battles of Viminacium]]. This battle was significant, as it was the first time the Avars suffered a major defeat in their home territory, and also led to the deaths of several more of Bayan's sons. After the battle, Priscus led his forces north into the [[Pannonian plain]], engaging and defeating the Avars deep within their heartland. Comentiolus meanwhile remained near the Danube, to guard it.{{sfn|Pohl|2002|p=156}} Priscus devastated the lands east of the [[Tisza]], inflicting heavy casualties on the Avars and Gepids,{{sfn|Pohl|2002|p=157}}{{sfn|Whitby|1998|p=164}} and defeating them in two further battles on the banks of the Tisza.{{sfn|Pohl|2002|p=158}} In autumn 599, Comentiolus reopened the [[Gates of Trajan]], which had not been used by the Byzantines for decades. In 601 Peter led troops to the banks of the Tisza, to defend the Danube cataracts, which were vital to the Byzantine Danube fleet's access to the cities of Sirmium and Singidunum.{{sfn|Whitby|1998|p=164}} The next year, in 602, the [[Antes (people)|Antes]] began to invade the Avars' land, who were already on the brink of collapse due to the uprisings of several Avar tribes,{{sfn|Whitby|1998|p=165}} one of whom even defected to the Byzantines.{{sfn|Pohl|2002|p=158}}

==Second interlude (602–612)==
After being beaten back by the Byzantines under Maurice, the Avars shifted their focus to Italy, establishing diplomatic contact in 603, and attempting an invasion of North Italy in 610.{{sfn|Petersen|2013|p=379}} The Balkan frontier was largely pacified, for the first time since the reign of [[Anastasius I Dicorus|Anastasius I]] ({{reign|491|518}}). Maurice planned to repopulate the devastated lands which the Byzantines had recovered by settling Armenian peasants, as well as romanizing the Slav settlers already in the area. Maurice also planned to lead further campaigns against the Avar Khaganate, so as to either destroy them or force them into submission. However, Maurice was overthrown in 602 by [[Phocas]], as his army rebelled at the endless Balkan campaigning.{{sfn|Mitchell|2007|p=408}} Phocas promptly scrapped those plans.{{sfn|Whitby|1998|p=184f}}

Phocas maintained the security of the Balkans during his reign from 602 to 610, although he did withdraw some forces from the Balkans in 605, in order to use them in the ongoing [[Byzantine-Sassanid War of 602–628]]. There is no archaeological evidence of Slav or Avar incursions during this time.{{sfn|Whitby|1998|p=187}}{{sfn|Curta|2001|p=189}} While the lack of Byzantine action encouraged the Avars,{{sfn|Whitby|1998|p=187}} they did not attack Byzantine territory until {{circa|615}}, when Emperor [[Heraclius]] ({{reign|610|641}}) withdrew his troops stationed in the Balkans in order to fight the Persian advance in the East.{{sfn|Petersen|2013|p=379}}

==Renewed Avar attacks (612–626)==
The Avars, who were likely encouraged by their successful campaigns against the Lombards in 610 and the Franks in 611, resumed their incursions some time after 612. By 614, with the [[Siege of Jerusalem (614)|Persian capture of Jerusalem]], it became clear to the Avars and their Slav subjects that retaliation from the Byzantines was extremely unlikely. Chronicles of the 610s record wholesale pillaging, with cities such as [[Justiniana Prima]] and [[Salona]] succumbing.{{sfn|Whitby|1998|p=187}} The cities of [[Naissus]] and [[Serdica]] were captured in 615, and the cities of Novae and Justiniana Prima were destroyed in 613 and 615, respectively. The Slavs also raided in the Aegean, as far as [[Crete]], in 623. During this time period, there were three separate sieges of Thessalonica: in [[Siege of Thessalonica (604)|604]], [[Siege of Thessalonica (615)|615]], and [[Siege of Thessalonica (617)|617]].{{sfn|Maier|1973|p=81}} In 623 the Byzantine emperor Heraclius journeyed into Thrace in an attempt to agree peace with the Avar Khagan face to face. Instead the Byzantines were ambushed, with Heraclius narrowly escaping and most of his bodyguard and retainers being killed or captured.{{sfn|Mitchell|2007|p=413}} The Avar raids continued, culminating in the [[Siege of Constantinople (626)|Siege of Constantinople]] in 626, where the Avars were finally defeated.{{sfn|Curta|2001|p=189}}{{sfn|Maier|1973|p=81}}

==Siege of Constantinople (626)==
{{Main article|Siege of Constantinople (626)}}
[[File:Moldovita murals 2010 16.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The Siege of Constantinople in 626 depicted on the [[murals]] of the [[Moldovița Monastery]], [[Romania]].|alt=A colorful mural made up of mostly red, blue and grey, which depicts the Siege of Constantinople in 626.]]
The Persian king [[Khosrau II]], after suffering reverses through Heraclius' campaigns in the Persian rear, resolved to launch a decisive strike.{{sfn|Norwich|1997|p=92}} While general [[Shahin Vahmanzadegan]] was sent to stop Heraclius with 50,000 men, [[Shahrbaraz]] was given command of a smaller army and ordered to slip by Heraclius' flank, and march for [[Chalcedon]], a Persian base across the [[Bosporus]] from [[Constantinople]]. Khosrau II also made contact with the [[Khagan]] of the Avars to allow for a coordinated attack on Constantinople, the Persians on the Asiatic side, and the Avars from the European side.{{sfn|Oman|1893|p=210}}

The Avar army approached Constantinople from Thrace and destroyed the [[Valens Aqueduct|Aqueduct of Valens]].{{sfn|Treadgold|1997|p=297}} Because the [[Byzantine navy]] controlled the Bosporus strait, the Persians could not send troops to the European side to aid the Avars,{{sfn|Kaegi|2003|pp=133, 140}} which deprived the Avars of the Persian expertise in siege warfare.{{sfn|Dodgeon|Greatrex|Lieu|2002|pp=179–181}} Byzantine naval superiority also made communication between the two forces difficult.{{sfn|Oman|1893|p=210}}{{sfn|Kaegi|2003|p=134}} Constantinople's defenders were under the command of Patriarch [[Sergius I of Constantinople|Sergius]] and the patrician [[Bonus (patrician)|Bonus]].{{sfn|Oman|1893|p=211}}

[[File:Constantinople area map.svg|thumb|left|A map of the environs of the siege.]]
On 29 June 626, the Avars and Persians began a coordinated assault upon the walls. The Byzantine defenders had 12,000 well-trained cavalry troops, who were likely dismounted, facing roughly 80,000 Avars and [[Sclaveni]] (Slavs whose land was controlled by the Avars).{{sfn|Norwich|1997|p=92}} Because the Persian base in Chalcedon had been established for many years, it was not immediately obvious that a siege would take place. It only became obvious to the Byzantines after the Avars began to move heavy siege equipment towards the [[Theodosian Walls]]. Although the walls were continuously bombarded for a month, morale was high in the city; Patriarch Sergius bolstered morale by leading processions along the tops of the walls, carrying the [[Blachernitissa]] icon of the [[Virgin Mary]].{{sfn|Norwich|1997|p=93}}{{sfn|Kaegi|2003|p=136}} The peasantry around Constantinople were rallied by this religious zeal, especially because both forces attacking Constantinople were [[Paganism|heathens]].{{sfn|Norwich|1997|p=93}}

On August 7, a fleet of Persian rafts ferrying troops across the Bosporus to the European side were surrounded and destroyed by the Byzantine fleet. The Sclaveni then attempted to attack the [[Sea Walls of Constantinople|Sea Walls]] from across the [[Golden Horn]], while the Avars attacked the land walls. However, the Sclaveni boats were rammed and destroyed by the galleys of Bonus, and the Avar land assaults on August 6th and 7th were repelled.{{sfn|Kaegi|2003|p=137}} At around this point, the news that the Emperor's brother [[Theodore (brother of Heraclius)|Theodore]] had decisively defeated Shahin arrived, leading the Avars to retreat to the Balkan hinterland within two days. They would never seriously threaten Constantinople again. Even though the Persian army of Shahrbaraz still remained at Chalcedon, the threat to Constantinople was over, as the Persians could not use artillery from their side of the Bosporus.{{sfn|Oman|1893|p=211}}{{sfn|Norwich|1997|p=93}} In thanks for the lifting of the siege and the supposed divine protection granted by the Virgin Mary, the celebrated [[Akathist Hymn]] was written by an unknown author, possibly Patriarch Sergius or [[George of Pisidia]].{{sfn|Ekonomou|2008|p=285}}{{sfn|Gambero|1999|p=338}}

==Avar decline (626–822)==
[[File:Territorial expansion during the reign of Khan Krum (803-814).png|Reduction of Avar lands by Bulgars|thumb]]
After failing to capture Constantinople, the Avars rapidly began to decline before disintegrating entirely,{{sfn|Hupchick|2017|p=48}} due to both internal power struggles, and conflicts with the [[Bulgars]] and Sclaveni.{{sfn|Chaliand|2014|p=81}} After their [[hegemony]] over various tribal peoples collapsed, their land was further reduced by the [[Bulgars]] around 680, leaving behind a [[rump state]] which remained until their conquest by [[Charlemagne]], starting in 790 and ending in 803.{{sfn|Petersen|2013|p=379}}

In [[physical cosmology]], '''Big Bang nucleosynthesis''' (abbreviated '''BBN''', also known as '''primordial nucleosynthesis''', '''arch(a)eonucleosynthesis''', '''archonucleosynthesis''', '''protonucleosynthesis''' and '''pal(a)eonucleosynthesis''')&lt;ref&gt;http://www-pdg.lbl.gov/2017/mobile/reviews/pdf/rpp2016-rev-bbang-nucleosynthesis-m.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; refers to the production of [[Atomic nucleus|nuclei]] other than those of the lightest [[isotope]] of [[hydrogen]] ([[hydrogen-1]], &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H, having a single [[proton]] as a nucleus) during the early phases of the [[Universe]]. Primordial [[nucleosynthesis]] is believed by most cosmologists to have taken place in the interval from roughly 10 seconds to 20 minutes after the [[Big Bang]],&lt;ref name="CocVangioni2017"&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is calculated to be responsible for the formation of most of the universe's [[helium]] as the [[Isotopes of helium|isotope]] [[helium-4]] (&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;He), along with small amounts of the hydrogen isotope [[deuterium]] (&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;H or D), the [[helium]] isotope [[helium-3]] (&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;He), and a very small amount of the [[lithium]] isotope [[lithium-7]] (&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;Li). In addition to these stable nuclei, two unstable or [[Radionuclide|radioactive]] isotopes were also produced: the heavy [[hydrogen]] isotope [[tritium]] (&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;H or T); and the [[beryllium]] isotope [[beryllium-7]] (&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;Be); but these [[Radionuclide|unstable isotopes]] later decayed into &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;He and &lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;Li, as above.

Essentially all of the elements that are heavier than lithium were created much later, by [[stellar nucleosynthesis]] in evolving and exploding stars.

==Characteristics==
There are several important characteristics of Big Bang nucleosynthesis (BBN):
* The initial conditions (neutron-proton ratio) were set in the first second after the Big Bang.
* The universe was very close to homogeneous at this time, and strongly [[radiation]]-dominated. 
* The fusion of nuclei occurred between roughly 10 seconds to 20 minutes after the Big Bang; this corresponds to the temperature range when the universe was cool enough for deuterium to survive, but hot and dense enough for [[Nuclear fusion|fusion]] reactions to occur at a significant rate.&lt;ref name=RPP&gt;{{cite journal

 | bibcode=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* It was widespread, encompassing the entire [[observable universe]].

The key parameter which allows one to calculate the effects of BBN is the baryon/photon number ratio, which is a small number of order 6 × 10&lt;sup&gt;−10&lt;/sup&gt;. This parameter corresponds to the baryon density and controls the rate at which nucleons collide and react; from this it is possible to calculate element abundances after nucleosynthesis ends. Although the baryon per photon ratio is important in determining element abundances, the precise value makes little difference to the overall picture. Without major changes to the Big Bang theory itself, BBN will result in mass abundances of about 75% of hydrogen-1, about 25% [[helium-4]], about 0.01% of deuterium and [[helium-3]], trace amounts (on the order of 10&lt;sup&gt;−10&lt;/sup&gt;) of lithium, and negligible heavier elements.  That the observed abundances in the universe are generally consistent with these abundance numbers is considered strong evidence for the Big Bang theory.

In this field, for historical reasons it is customary to quote the helium-4 fraction ''by mass'', symbol Y, so that 25% helium-4 means that helium-4 atoms account for 25% of the [[mass]], but less than 8% of the nuclei would be helium-4 nuclei. Other (trace) nuclei are usually expressed as number ratios to hydrogen.

==Important parameters==
The creation of light elements during BBN was dependent on a number of parameters; among those was the neutron-proton ratio (calculable from [[Standard Model|Standard Model physics]]) and the baryon-photon ratio.

===Neutron–proton ratio===
The neutron-proton ratio was set by Standard Model physics before the nucleosynthesis era, 
essentially within the first 1-second after the Big Bang. 
Neutrons can react with positrons or electron neutrinos to create protons and other products in one of the following reactions:
:&lt;chem&gt;n \ + e+ &lt;=&gt; \overline{\nu}_e + p  &lt;/chem&gt;
:&lt;chem&gt;n \ + \nu_{e} &lt;=&gt; p + e- &lt;/chem&gt;

At times much earlier than 1 sec, these reactions were fast and maintained the n/p ratio close to 1:1. As the temperature dropped, the equilibrium shifted in favour of protons due to their slightly lower mass, and the n/p ratio smoothly decreased.  
These reactions continued until the decreasing temperature and density caused the reactions to become too slow, which occurred at about T = 0.7 MeV (time around 1 second) and is called the freeze out temperature. At freeze out, the neutron-proton ratio was about 1/6. However, free neutrons are unstable with a mean life of 880 sec; some neutrons decayed in the next few minutes before fusing into any nucleus, so the ratio of total neutrons to protons after nucleosynthesis ends is about 1/7.  Almost all neutrons that fused instead of decaying ended up combined into helium-4, due to the fact that helium-4 has the highest [[Nuclear binding energy|binding energy]] per nucleon among light elements. This predicts that about 8% of all atoms should be helium-4, leading to a mass fraction of helium-4 of about 25%, which is in line with observations. Small traces of deuterium and helium-3 remained as there was insufficient time and density for them to react and form helium-4.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Baryon–photon ratio===
The baryon–photon ratio, η, is the key parameter determining the abundances of light elements after nucleosynthesis ends. Baryons and light elements can fuse in the following main reactions:
{|style="text-align:right;"

|

:&lt;chem&gt;p + n -&gt; ^2H + \gamma &lt;/chem&gt;
:&lt;chem&gt;p + ^2H -&gt; ^3He + \gamma &lt;/chem&gt;
:&lt;chem&gt;^2H + ^2H -&gt; ^3He + n &lt;/chem&gt;
:&lt;chem&gt;^2H + ^2H -&gt; ^3H + p &lt;/chem&gt;
:&lt;chem&gt;^3He + ^2H -&gt; ^4He + p &lt;/chem&gt;
:&lt;chem&gt;^3H + ^2H -&gt; ^4He + n &lt;/chem&gt;
|}
along with some other low-probability reactions leading to &lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;Li or &lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;Be. 
(An important feature is that there are no stable nuclei with mass 5 or 8, which implies that reactions adding one baryon to &lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;He, or fusing two &lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;He, do not occur). 
Most fusion chains during BBN ultimately terminate in &lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;He (helium-4), while "incomplete" reaction chains lead to small amounts of left-over &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;H or &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;He; the amount of these decreases with increasing baryon-photon ratio. That is, the larger the baryon-photon ratio the more reactions there will be and the more efficiently deuterium will be eventually transformed into helium-4. This result makes deuterium a very useful tool in measuring the baryon-to-photon ratio.

==Sequence==
[[File:Scheme of nuclear reaction chains for Big Bang nucleosynthesis.svg|thumb|300px|The main nuclear reaction chains for Big Bang nucleosynthesis]]

Big Bang nucleosynthesis began roughly 10 seconds after the big bang, when the universe had cooled sufficiently to allow deuterium nuclei to survive disruption by high-energy photons. (Note that the neutron-proton freeze-out time was earlier). This time is essentially independent of dark matter content, since the universe was highly radiation dominated until much later, and this dominant component controls the temperature/time relation. At this time there were about 
six protons for every neutron, but a small fraction of the neutrons decay before fusing in the next few hundred seconds, so at the end of nucleosynthesis there are about seven protons to every neutron, and almost all the neutrons are in Helium-4 nuclei.  The sequence of these reaction chains is shown on the image.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Carlos A. | last=Bertulani | authorlink=Carlos Bertulani | title=Nuclei in the Cosmos | publisher=World Scientific | date=2013 | isbn=978-981-4417-66-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One feature of BBN is that the physical laws and constants that govern the behavior of matter at these energies are very well understood, and hence BBN lacks some of the speculative uncertainties that characterize earlier periods in the life of the universe. Another feature is that the process of nucleosynthesis is determined by conditions at the start of this phase of the life of the universe, and proceeds independently of what happened before.

As the universe expands, it cools. [[Free neutron]]s are less stable than helium nuclei, and the protons and neutrons have a strong tendency to form helium-4. However, forming helium-4 requires the intermediate step of forming deuterium. Before nucleosynthesis began, the temperature was high enough for many photons to have energy greater than the binding energy of deuterium; therefore any deuterium that was formed was immediately destroyed (a situation known as the '''deuterium bottleneck'''). Hence, the formation of helium-4 is delayed until the universe became cool enough for deuterium to survive (at about T = 0.1 MeV); after which there was a sudden burst of element formation. However, very shortly thereafter, around twenty minutes after the Big Bang, the temperature and density became too low for any significant fusion to occur. At this point, the elemental abundances were nearly fixed, and the only changes were the result of the [[radioactive]] decay of the two major unstable products of BBN, [[tritium]] and [[beryllium-7]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Weiss | first = Achim | title = Equilibrium and change: The physics behind Big Bang Nucleosynthesis | url = http://www.einstein-online.info/en/spotlights/BBN_phys/index.html | website = Einstein Online | accessdate = 2007-02-24 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070208212219/http://www.einstein-online.info/en/spotlights/BBN_phys/index.html | archivedate = 8 February 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt; | deadurl = no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===History of theory===
The history of Big Bang nucleosynthesis began with the calculations of [[Ralph Alpher]] in the 1940s. Alpher published the [[Alpher–Bethe–Gamow paper]] that outlined the theory of light-element production in the early universe.

During the 1970s, there was a major puzzle in that the density of baryons as calculated by Big Bang nucleosynthesis was much less than the observed mass of the universe based on measurements of galaxy rotation curves and galaxy cluster dynamics. This puzzle was resolved in large part by postulating the existence of [[dark matter]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2015}}

===Heavy elements===
{{Nucleosynthesis periodic table.svg}}
Big Bang nucleosynthesis produced very few nuclei of elements heavier than [[lithium]] due to a bottleneck: the absence of a stable nucleus with 8 or 5 [[nucleon]]s. This deficit of larger atoms also limited the amounts of lithium-7 produced during BBN. In [[stellar nucleosynthesis|stars]], the bottleneck is passed by triple collisions of helium-4 nuclei, producing [[carbon]] (the [[triple-alpha process]]). However, this process is very slow and requires much higher densities, taking tens of thousands of years to convert a significant amount of helium to carbon in stars, and therefore it made a negligible contribution in the minutes following the Big Bang.

The predicted abundance of CNO isotopes produced in Big Bang nucleosynthesis is expected to be on the order of 10&lt;sup&gt;−15&lt;/sup&gt; that of H, making them essentially undetectable and negligible.&lt;ref name=iop&gt;{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1088/1742-6596/665/1/012001|title = Primordial Nucleosynthesis|journal = Journal of Physics: Conference Series|volume = 665|pages = 012001|year = 2017|last1 = Coc|first1 = A|arxiv = 1609.06048}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, none of these primordial isotopes of the elements from lithium to oxygen have yet been detected, although those of beryllium and boron may be able to be detected in the future. So far, the only stable nuclides known experimentally to have been made before or during Big Bang nucleosynthesis are protium, deuterium, helium-3, helium-4, and lithium-7.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite arxiv |eprint = 1403.4156v1|last1 = Coc|first1 = Alain|title = Revised Big Bang Nucleosynthesis with long-lived negatively charged massive particles: Impact of new 6Li limits, primordial 9Be nucleosynthesis, and updated recombination rates|last2 = Vangioni|first2 = Elisabeth|class = astro-ph.CO|year = 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Helium-4===
{{Main article|Helium-4}}
Big Bang nucleosynthesis predicts a primordial abundance of about 25% helium-4 by mass, irrespective of the initial conditions of the universe. As long as the universe was hot enough for protons and neutrons to transform into each other easily, their ratio, determined solely by their relative masses, was about 1 neutron to 7 protons (allowing for some decay of neutrons into protons). Once it was cool enough, the neutrons quickly bound with an equal number of protons to form first deuterium, then helium-4. Helium-4 is very stable and is nearly the end of this chain if it runs for only a short time, since helium neither decays nor combines easily to form heavier nuclei (since there are no stable nuclei with mass numbers of 5 or 8, helium does not combine easily with either protons, or with itself). Once temperatures are lowered, out of every 16 nucleons (2 neutrons and 14 protons), 4 of these (25% of the total particles and total mass) combine quickly into one helium-4 nucleus. This produces one helium for every 12 hydrogens, resulting in a universe that is a little over 8% helium by number of atoms, and 25% helium by mass.

One analogy is to think of helium-4 as ash, and the amount of ash that one forms when one completely burns a piece of wood is insensitive to how one burns it. The resort to the BBN theory of the helium-4 abundance is necessary as there is far more helium-4 in the universe than can be explained by [[stellar nucleosynthesis]]. In addition, it provides an important test for the Big Bang theory. If the observed helium abundance is significantly different from 25%, then this would pose a serious challenge to the theory. This would particularly be the case if the early helium-4 abundance was much smaller than 25% because it is hard to destroy helium-4. For a few years during the mid-1990s, observations suggested that this might be the case, causing astrophysicists to talk about a Big Bang nucleosynthetic crisis, but further observations were consistent with the Big Bang theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

===Deuterium===
{{Main article|Deuterium}}
{{unreferenced section|date=March 2017}}
Deuterium is in some ways the opposite of helium-4, in that while helium-4 is very stable and difficult to destroy, deuterium is only marginally stable and easy to destroy. The temperatures, time, and densities were sufficient to combine a substantial fraction of the deuterium nuclei to form helium-4 but insufficient to carry the process further using helium-4 in the next fusion step. BBN did not convert all of the deuterium in the universe to helium-4 due to the expansion that cooled the universe and reduced the density, and so cut that conversion short before it could proceed any further. One consequence of this is that, unlike helium-4, the amount of deuterium is very sensitive to initial conditions. The denser the initial universe was, the more deuterium would be converted to helium-4 before time ran out, and the less deuterium would remain.

There are no known post-Big Bang processes which can produce significant amounts of deuterium. Hence observations about deuterium abundance suggest that the universe is not infinitely old, which is in accordance with the Big Bang theory.

During the 1970s, there were major efforts to find processes that could produce deuterium, but those revealed ways of producing isotopes other than deuterium. The problem was that while the concentration of deuterium in the universe is consistent with the Big Bang model as a whole, it is too high to be consistent with a model that presumes that most of the universe is composed of [[proton]]s and [[neutron]]s.  If one assumes that all of the universe consists of protons and neutrons, the density of the universe is such that much of the currently observed deuterium would have been burned into helium-4.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} The standard explanation now used for the abundance of deuterium is that the universe does not consist mostly of baryons, but that non-baryonic matter (also known as [[dark matter]]) makes up most of the mass of the universe.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}  This explanation is also consistent with calculations that show that a universe made mostly of protons and neutrons would be far more ''clumpy'' than is observed.&lt;ref&gt;[[David Schramm (astrophysicist)|Schramm, D. N.]], ''The Big Bang and Other Explosions in Nuclear and Particle Astrophysics'' ([[Singapore]]: [[World Scientific]], 1995), [https://books.google.com/books?id=TtrxQGjYqU8C&amp;pg=PA175 p. 175].&lt;/ref&gt;

It is very hard to come up with another process that would produce deuterium other than by nuclear fusion. Such a process would require that the temperature be hot enough to produce deuterium, but not hot enough to produce helium-4, and that this process should immediately cool to non-nuclear temperatures after no more than a few minutes. It would also be necessary for the deuterium to be swept away before it reoccurs.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

Producing deuterium by fission is also difficult. The problem here again is that deuterium is very unlikely due to nuclear processes, and that collisions between atomic nuclei are likely to result either in the fusion of the nuclei, or in the release of free neutrons or [[alpha particles]]. During the 1970s, [[cosmic ray spallation]] was proposed as a source of deuterium. That theory failed to account for the abundance of deuterium, but led to explanations of the source of other light elements.

===Lithium===
{{Main article|Lithium}}
Lithium-7 and lithium-6 produced in the Big Bang are in the order of: lithium-7 to be 10&lt;sup&gt;−9&lt;/sup&gt; of all primordial nuclides; and lithium-6 around 10&lt;sup&gt;−13&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name="Primodal-lithium-problem-2012-arx"&gt;BD Fields [https://arxiv.org/pdf/1203.3551v1.pdf "The Primordial Lithium Problem"], ''Annual Review of Nuclear and Particle Science'' 2011 &lt;!-- Cited by 54--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Measurements and status of theory==
The theory of BBN gives a detailed mathematical description of the production of the light "elements" deuterium, helium-3, helium-4, and lithium-7. Specifically, the theory yields precise quantitative predictions for the mixture of these elements, that is, the primordial abundances at the end of the big-bang.

In order to test these predictions, it is necessary to reconstruct the primordial abundances as faithfully as possible, for instance by observing astronomical objects in which very little [[stellar nucleosynthesis]] has taken place (such as certain [[Dwarf galaxy|dwarf galaxies]]) or by observing objects that are very far away, and thus can be seen in a very early stage of their evolution (such as distant [[quasar]]s).

As noted above, in the standard picture of BBN, all of the light element abundances depend on the amount of ordinary matter ([[baryon]]s) relative to radiation ([[photons]]). Since the [[Cosmological Principle|universe is presumed to be homogeneous]], it has one unique value of the baryon-to-photon ratio. For a long time, this meant that to test BBN theory against observations one had to ask: can ''all'' of the light element observations be explained with a ''single value'' of the baryon-to-photon ratio? Or more precisely, allowing for the finite precision of both the predictions and the observations, one asks: is there some ''range'' of baryon-to-photon values which can account for all of the observations?

More recently, the question has changed: Precision observations of the [[cosmic microwave background radiation]]&lt;ref&gt;David Toback (2009).

Using this value, are the BBN predictions for the abundances of light elements in agreement with the observations?

The present measurement of helium-4 indicates good agreement, and yet better agreement for helium-3. But for lithium-7, there is a significant discrepancy between BBN and WMAP/Planck, and the abundance derived from [[Population II stars]]. The discrepancy is a factor of 2.4―4.3 below the theoretically predicted value and is considered a problem for the original models,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=A Bitter Pill: The Primordial Lithium Problem Worsens |author=R.

==Non-standard scenarios==
In addition to the standard BBN scenario there are numerous non-standard BBN scenarios. These should not be confused with [[non-standard cosmology]]: a non-standard BBN scenario assumes that the Big Bang occurred, but inserts additional physics in order to see how this affects elemental abundances. These pieces of additional physics include relaxing or removing the assumption of homogeneity, or inserting new particles such as massive [[neutrino]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Soler, F. J. P., Froggatt, C. D., &amp; Muheim, F., eds., ''Neutrinos in Particle Physics, Astrophysics and Cosmology'' ([[Baton Rouge, Louisiana|Baton Rouge]]: [[CRC Press]], 2009), [https://books.google.cz/books?id=mRGThuuYHgsC&amp;pg=PA362 p. 362].&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been, and continue to be, various reasons for researching non-standard BBN. The first, which is largely of historical interest, is to resolve inconsistencies between BBN predictions and observations. This has proved to be of limited usefulness in that the inconsistencies were resolved by better observations, and in most cases trying to change BBN resulted in abundances that were more inconsistent with observations rather than less. The second reason for researching non-standard BBN, and largely the focus of non-standard BBN in the early 21st century, is to use BBN to place limits on unknown or speculative physics. For example, standard BBN assumes that no exotic hypothetical particles were involved in BBN. One can insert a hypothetical particle (such as a massive neutrino) and see what has to happen before BBN predicts abundances that are very different from observations. This has been done to put limits on the mass of a stable [[tau neutrino]].&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, R. W., ''The Cosmic Compendium: The Big Bang &amp; the Early Universe'' ([[Morrisville, North Carolina|Morrisville, NC]]: [[Lulu (company)|Lulu Press, Inc.]], 2015), [https://books.google.cz/books?id=9U6yCQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA54 p. 54].&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3363">'''Brit Insurance Design Awards''', established in 2003 by the [[Design Museum]] in [[London]], is the United Kingdom's pre-eminent design award with a £25,000 prize. The prize "aims to stimulate public debate about design and to raise awareness of its role enhancing the quality of daily life,&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web|url=http://www.designmuseum.org/exhibimg/mediarelease_134.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-10-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725231342/http://designmuseum.org/exhibimg/mediarelease_134.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and in its first three years was televised on [[BBC Two]]. 

A judging panel made up of renowned design experts decide the best entries in the seven categories, with Individual category award-winners announced in February to then go forward to compete to be the Brit Insurance Designer of the Year, which is announced at an Awards Dinner in March.

==Exhibition==
The Brit Insurance Designs of the Year exhibition, showcasing all the shortlisted designs is held annually at the Design Museum. It is an exploration of the most innovative, interesting and forward looking designs produced over the last twelve months from around the world and celebrated in seven categories: Architecture, Transport, Graphics, Interactive, Product, Furniture and Fashion. A number of internationally respected design experts are invited to nominate up to five projects, each of which, in their view, represents the best or the most interesting designs produced or launched in the last year.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.designophy.com/newslog/article.php?UIN=1000001391&lt;/ref&gt;

==Winners==
The winner in 2003 was [[Jonathan Ive]], senior vice-president of industrial design at [[Apple, Inc.]], whose innovations include the [[iPod]], [[iPhone]] and [[iMac]]. In 2004, the award was won by digital designer and artist Daniel Brown.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/5008364.stm Gorillaz artist wins design award]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, the museum courted controversy by awarding the prize to a [[Design Council]] official, Hillary Cottam, rather than to an actual architect or designer. In 2006, a humanitarian architect, [[Cameron Sinclair]], whose work aided many disaster-ravaged communities across the world, was competing against a graphic designer, [[Jamie Hewlett]], for his work on the popular [[Gorillaz]] virtual band. Gorillaz won the award.&lt;ref&gt;[http://arts.guardian.co.uk/news/story/0,,1781137,00.html Design award for Gorillaz creator | | Guardian Unlimited Arts]&lt;/ref&gt;In 2009, renowned American street artist, activist and designer [[Shepard Fairey]] was awarded for his iconic "Hope" poster commemorating the inauguration of President [[Barack Obama]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dezeen.com/2009/03/19/shepard-fairey-wins-design-of-the-year/|work=Shepard Fairey Wins Design of the Year|accessdate=15 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2011, [[Hulger]] and Sam Wilkinson won with their [[Plumen]] designer low energy light bulb.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7886">A '''cache stampede''' is a type of [[cascading failure]] that can occur when massively [[parallel computing]] systems with [[caching (computing)|caching]] mechanisms come under very high load. This behaviour is sometimes also called '''dog-piling'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Developing Web Applications with Apache, MySQL, memcached, and Perl|first=Patrick|last=Galbraith|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|year=2009|isbn=9780470538326|page=353|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=daDAnXPnRkcC&amp;pg=PA353}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Web Operations: Keeping the Data On Time|pages=128–132|first1=John|last1=Allspaw|first2=Jesse|last2=Robbins|publisher=O'Reilly Media|year=2010|isbn=9781449394158|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0oXB7aFQ1FwC&amp;pg=PA128}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

To understand how cache stampedes occur, consider a [[web server]] that uses [[memcached]] to cache rendered pages for some period of time, to ease system load. Under particularly high load to a single URL, the system remains responsive as long as the resource remains cached, with requests being handled by accessing the cached copy. This minimizes the expensive rendering operation.

Under low load, cache misses result in a single recalculation of the rendering operation. The system will continue as before, with average load being kept very low because of the high cache hit rate.

However, under ''very'' heavy load, when the cached version of that page expires, there may be sufficient [[Concurrency (computer science)|concurrency]] in the server farm that multiple threads of execution will all attempt to render the content of that page simultaneously. Systematically, none of the concurrent servers know that the others are doing the same rendering at the same time. If sufficiently high load is present, this may by itself be enough to bring about [[congestion collapse]] of the system via exhausting shared resources. Congestion collapse results in preventing the page from ever being completely re-rendered and re-cached, as every attempt to do so times out. Thus, cache stampede reduces the cache hit rate to zero and keeps the system continuously in congestion collapse as it attempts to regenerate the resource for as long as the load remains very heavy.

To give a concrete example, assume the page in consideration takes 3 seconds to render and we have a traffic of 10 requests per second. Then, when the cached page expires, we have 30 processes simultaneously recomputing the rendering of the page and updating the cache with the rendered page.

== Typical cache usage ==
Below is a typical cache usage pattern for an item that needs to be updated every {{mono|''ttl''}} units of time:

  '''function''' fetch(''key'', ''ttl'') {
    ''value'' ← cache_read(''key'')
    '''if''' (!''value'') {
      ''value'' ← recompute_value()
      cache_write(''key'', ''value'', ''ttl'')
    }
    '''return''' ''value''
  }

If the function {{mono|recompute_value()}} takes a long time and the key is accessed frequently, many processes will simultaneously call {{mono|recompute_value()}} upon expiration of the cache value.

In typical web applications, the function {{mono||recompute_value()}} may query a database, access other services, or perform some complicated operation (which is why this particular computation is being cached in the first place). When the request rate is high, the database (or any other shared resource) will suffer from an overload of requests/queries, which may in turn cause a system collapse.

== Cache stampede mitigation ==
Several approaches have been proposed to mitigate cache stampedes. (Also known as dogpile prevention) They can be roughly grouped in 3 main categories.

=== Locking ===
To prevent multiple simultaneous recomputations of the same value, upon a cache miss a process will attempt to acquire the lock for that cache key and recompute it only if it acquires it.

There are different implementation options for the case when the lock is ''not'' acquired:
* Wait until the value is recomputed
* Return a "not-found" and have the client handle the absence of the value properly
* Keep a stale item in the cache to be used while the new value is recomputed

If implemented properly, locking can prevent stampedes altogether, but requires an extra write for the locking mechanism. Apart from doubling the number of writes, the main drawback is a correct implementation of the locking mechanism which also takes care of edge cases including failure of the process acquiring the lock, tuning of a time-to-live for the lock, race-conditions, and so on.

=== External recomputation ===
This solution moves the recomputation of the cache value from the processes needing it to an external process. The recomputation of the external process can be triggered in different ways:
* When the cache value approaches its expiration
* Periodically
* When a process needing the value encounters a cache miss

This approach requires one more moving part - the external process - that needs to be maintained and monitored. In addition, this solution requires unnatural code separation/duplication and is mostly suited for static cache keys (i.e., not dynamically generated, as in the case of keys indexed by an id).

=== Probabilistic early expiration ===
With this approach, each process may recompute the cache value before its expiration by making an independent probabilistic decision, where the probability of performing the early recomputation increases as we get closer to the expiration of the value. Since the probabilistic decision is made independently by each process, the effect of the stampede is mitigated as less processes will expire at the same time.

The following implementation based on an exponential distribution has been shown to be optimal in terms of its effectiveness in preventing stampedes and how early recomputations can happen.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Optimal Probabilistic Cache Stampede Prevention|first1=A.|last1=Vattani|first2=F.|last2=Chierichetti|first3=K.|last3=Lowenstein|publisher=VLDB|year=2015|volume=8|number=8|pages=886–897|issn=2150-8097|url=http://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~avattani/papers/cache_stampede.pdf}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

  '''function''' x-fetch(''key'', ''ttl'', ''beta''=1) {
    ''value'', ''delta'', ''expiry'' ← cache_read(''key'')
    if (!''value'' || time() − ''delta'' * ''beta'' * log(rand(0,1)) ≥ ''expiry'') {
      ''start'' ← time()
      ''value'' ← recompute_value()
      ''delta'' ← time() – start
      cache_write(''key'', (''value'', ''delta''), ''ttl'')
    }
    '''return''' ''value''
  }

The parameter {{mono|''beta''}} can be set to a value greater than 1 to favor earlier recomputations and further reduce stampedes but the authors show that setting {{mono|''beta''}}=1 works well in practice. The variable {{mono|''delta''}} represents the time to recompute the value and is used to scale the probability distribution appropriately.

This approach is simple to implement and effectively reduces cache stampedes by automatically favoring early recomputations when the traffic rate increases. One drawback is that it takes more memory in cache as we need to bundle the value ''delta'' with the cache item - when the caching system does not support retrieval of the key expiration time, we also need to store the {{mono||''expiry''}} (that is, {{mono||time() + ''ttl''}}) in the bundle.

'''Caesar's Camp''' is an [[Iron Age]] [[hill fort]] around 2400 years old. It is located just in [[Crowthorne]] [[civil parish]] to the south of [[Bracknell]] in the [[England|English]] county of [[Berkshire]]. It falls within the [[Windsor Forest]] and is well wooded, although parts of the fort have now been cleared of some trees. The area is managed by the [[Forestry Commission]] but owned by [[Crown Estate Commission]], and is open and accessible to the public. The hill fort covers an area of about 17.2 acres (7 hectares) and is surrounded by a mile-long ditch, making it one of the largest in southern England.&lt;ref name=NHL1016334&gt;{{National Heritage List for England |num=1016334|accessdate=23 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The origin of the name "Caesar's Camp" is unknown. However, the hill fort is close to the [[Roman road]] known as the [[Devil's Highway (Roman Britain)|Devil's Highway]], and this may have led Medieval mapmakers to attribute the structure (wrongly) to the Romans. But the person who named the road must not have known its Roman origin, so mistakenly attributed it to Satan.

==History==
Caesar's Camp is thought to have been established around 500–300BC. It is the only hill fort of its type that has been identified in east Berkshire.&lt;ref name=Cotton&gt;{{cite journal | last = Cotton | first = Aylwin | author-link = Molly Cotton | title = Berkshire Hill Forts | journal = Berkshire Archaeological Journal | volume = 60 | pages = 30–52 | year = 1962 | url = http://archaeologydataservice.ac.uk/archives/view/berks_bas_2007/journal.cfm?volume=60 | doi = 10.5284/1000017 | access-date = 2016-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because the area had a thick bed of sandstone beneath the top layers of soil, it was likely not suitable for farming – the community at Caesar's Camp was therefore dependent on the produce of neighbouring settlements. Caesar's Camp was therefore most likely used as an assembly point and a marketplace. Its huge outer walls and {{convert|1|mi|km|adj=mid|-long}} dump rampart also suggest that it was used as a safe haven in case of attack.
[[File:Caesar's Camp - geograph.org.uk - 1181919.jpg|thumb|right|[[Multivallate]] defences at Caesar's Camp]]

Caesar's Camp appears to have fallen under the rule of Cunobelin, king of the [[Catuvellauni]] tribe in the first century AD from a coin discovered in the interior.&lt;ref name=Cotton /&gt;   Soon after, the [[Roman Empire|Romans]] invaded England; after this time, there is no evidence that Caesar's Camp continued to exist as an inhabited community.  A road from its south entrance was later built, connecting it to the [[Devil's Highway (Roman Britain)]]. There is a small Roman settlement about halfway along this road, known as Wickham Bushes, which has yielded pottery and other Roman artifacts. The main [[Roman road]] connected [[Londinium]] with [[Calleva Atrebatum]], the tribal capital of the [[Atrebates]] [[Celts|celtic]] tribe about 10 miles to the west in [[Hampshire]].

A [[redoubt]] roughly 40&amp;nbsp;m across in the fort is thought to be part of a defence line built in 1792 in preparation for the [[Napoleonic Wars]].&lt;ref name=NHL1016334 /&gt;

==Description==
[[File:Pine trees, Caesar's Camp - geograph.org.uk - 1181921.jpg|thumb|right|[[Scots pine]]s on bank at Caesar's Camp]]
[[File:Caesar's Camp, Bracknell Forest 01.jpg|thumb|right|[[Ericaceae|Heather]] on upper rampart at Caesar's Camp]]
The layout consists of a number of steep banks and ditches in the shape of an oak leaf, enclosing a large flat area of a settlement. The main entrance is at its northern end (at the tip of the leaf) and is very well defended with multiple banks and a sinuous entrance road. The banks to the side of the entrance are very steep, guiding any entrants along the way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Hogg | first = A H A | title = Hill-forts of Britain | publisher = Hart-Davis | year = 1975 | pages = 157 | isbn = 978-0246108357}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is north of the [[Roman road]] known as the [[Devil's Highway (Roman Britain)|Devil's Highway]]
which connected [[Londinium]] to [[Calleva Atrebatum]] (Silchester). It is within the Crowthorne Woods part of [[Swinley Forest]] crown plantation and is located off [[Nine Mile Ride]] approximately {{convert|0.75|mi|km|1}} from the Look Out visitor centre. Much of the fort is covered by mature [[broadleaf]] and [[coniferous]] trees, although some of the [[spruce]]  [[plantation]] on the southern part of the fort has been cleared, and the ground reverted to [[heathland]] and scrub. On clear days, central [[Bracknell]] and [[Crowthorne]], including [[Broadmoor hospital]], are visible from its highest points. The camp falls within the [[Broadmoor to Bagshot Woods and Heaths]] [[Site of Special Scientific Interest]], and forms part of the northern edge of the SSI. The zone protects numerous rare birds such as the [[woodlark]] and [[nightjar]], as well as its diverse insect life and [[fauna]].

It is an entirely hand-built complex.&lt;ref name=Bracknell&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.bracknell-forest.gov.uk/caesarscamp | title = Caesar's Camp | publisher = [[Bracknell Forest Council]] | access-date = 2016-02-23 | quote = The hillfort which covers an area of about 17.2 acres (7 hectares) and is surrounded by a mile-long ditch, is a remarkable piece of engineering having been constructed entirely by hand using basic tools.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The camp has suffered significant erosion, both natural and man-made.

The '''Compagnie de 1602''' is an historic and patriotic association in [[Geneva]] who organize the official commemoration of the [[L'Escalade|Escalade]]. This association was established on March 31, 1926.

==Previous history==
The [[L'Escalade|Escalade]] was celebrated immediately after the attack of the Savoyards, but the patriotic commemoration became very important only in the middle of the 19th century (in 1860).&lt;ref&gt;Immédiatement après la nuit du 11 au 12 décembre 1602, les Genevois ont eu conscience d'avoir, en préservant leur indépendance et leur foi, « joué leur destin ». La première commémoration, un jeûne décrété par les autorités civiles et religieuses, eut lieu dix jours après l'Escalade. On voulait remercier Dieu pour sa protection et célébrer sa louange. Puis, malgré les réticences de la Compagnie des Pasteurs, hostile au culte des morts, on décide dès 1603 d'apposer sur le mur nord du temple de Saint-Gervais une plaque sur laquelle sont gravés les noms des victimes de l'Escalade. in http://etat.geneve.ch/dt/archives/commemorations-66-2191-971.html&lt;/ref&gt; In this time, Geneva builds monuments in memory of the Escalade. The first processions with historical costumes take place(1867–1868) - military and gymnastics groups compose the processions - and the famous Pot in chocolate is created (10 décembre 1881).

In 1898, "the genevan patriotic association for the Escalade" is created with the aim of the tercentenary of the Escalade (in 1902).&lt;ref&gt;En 1898, un groupe de citoyens genevois, ayant à cœur de rendre une certaine tenue à la fête devenue une forme de carnaval, créent l'Association patriotique genevoise pour la rénovation de l'Escalade. Celle-ci se donne pour principal objectif la commémoration du trois centième anniversaire de 1902. Ces festivités, accompagnées d'un culte et d'un grand cortège historique, ancrent définitivement la tradition commémorative de l'Escalade dans la cité http://etat.geneve.ch/dt/archives/commemorations-66-2191-972.html&lt;/ref&gt; The Compagnie de 1602 is created some years after, on March 31, 1926 and succeeds the former association &lt;ref&gt;''la Compagnie de 1602 a succédé à l'ancien Comité  qui, sous l'active et intelligente direction de son vénérable  président d'honneur, M. Louis Roux, aidé de fidèles collaborateurs, s'est  efforcé pendant plus de vingt ans de donner aux fêtes de l'Escalade le caractère tout à la fois sérieux et pittoresque, qui leur convient''. Bulletin de la Compagnie de 1602. 20 novembre 1926, n°1.&lt;/ref&gt; 
October 27, 1926 a few months after its foundation, the association has 56 members - named "Compagnons" ; some are very famous Genevan or Swiss personalities, for instance: [[Gustave Ador]], Édouard Elzingre...

==Become a "Compagnon"==
[[File:Commémoration de l'Escalade à Genève 05.jpg|thumb|the chief of pikemen in the Parade]]
In 1926 as today, the Members of the Compagnie must be Swiss and receive the signature and agreement of two members (as a sponsorship).&lt;ref&gt;Le bulletin du 20 novembre 1926 mentionne: ''Il importe que les Compagnons de 1602 soient nombreux. Les conditions d'admission sont les suivantes: Être  citoyen  suisse;  être  présenté  par  deux compagnons. Les  compagnons paient un droit d'entrée de 10fr. au minimum; ils ne paient point de cotisation annuelle.''&lt;/ref&gt; The foreigners are welcomed as sympathizers members. Every member - men, women and children - pays a financial contribution. Finally there is no religious, political or social distinction within this association.&lt;ref&gt;See also: "Statuts de la Compagnie de 1602", Ed. 2010, Bulletin de la Compagnie de 1602. - Genève No 365(été 2011), 4 p. encartées.&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2011 the association had approximately 2500 members.

==Historical costumes==
The historical costumes which dress approximately 800 persons during the Parade of Escalade do not date from 1602. They were made at the beginning and in the middle of the 20th century and they are inspired by the drawings of Elzingre. However, historical research shows that some colors used in these costumes did not exist in 1602 and are not good examples of austere lifestyle in [[Geneva]] after the [[Reformation]]...&lt;ref&gt;See: http://www.protestant.ch/applic/ge/WebDocs.nsf/0/d7c244a3003b0598c1257522002f33a5/$FILE/VP%20d%C3%A9cembre%2021.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Bon nombre de costumes de la Compagnie de 1602 commencent effectivement à se faire vieux. Collectée depuis le début du XXe siècle, une grande partie d’entre eux a été confectionnée dans les années cinquante. «Certains, environ 300, sont très usés. Les remplacer est aujourd’hui urgent, explique Ivan Rochat, président de la société. Avec un peu plus de 800 participants à habiller lors du défilé, nous avons peu de marge en matière de costumes. Voire aucune, dans certains groupes.»  La donation de la Fondation Hans Wilsdorf tombe donc à pic. «C’est une offre exceptionnelle, se réjouit Ivan Rochat. Elle nous permettra d’acquérir, sur trois ans, entre 150 et 200 costumes neufs, soit à peu près un quart du nombre total de tenues.» La Compagnie de 1602 continue néanmoins de chercher des fonds auprès d’autres institutions, afin de remplacer le reste des uniformes les plus usés. «Il nous faut encore trouver un montant d’environ 430?000?francs», précise son président. [...] La compagnie tentera, pour ses nouveaux costumes, d’être au plus près de la réalité historique, mais ne bannira pas les couleurs du cortège. Objectif, ne pas se retrouver avec un défilé nocturne «trop triste». Le président conclut: «Nous suivrons une voie intermédiaire. Se conformer à 100% à l’histoire est complexe: nous avons effectivement créé nos tenues suite à des recherches historiques, mais aussi selon les dessins du peintre genevois Elzingre, qui ne sont pas tout à fait historiquement corrects.»" in {{cite web |url=http://archives.tdg.ch/hans-wilsdorf-compagnie-1602-aura-nouveaux-costumes-2011-05-20 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-06-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140602201137/http://archives.tdg.ch/hans-wilsdorf-compagnie-1602-aura-nouveaux-costumes-2011-05-20 |archivedate=2014-06-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tribute to the heroes==
This solemn parade take place on Friday evening and traditionally marks the start of the festivities. Legacy of earlier parades of the early 20th century, it reflects the will to make a tribute to the 18 victims of the Geneva Escalade. Thus, along a path leading from Bourg-de-Four to the Protestant church of Saint-Gervais - burial place of those victims - the political authorities of the city and county lay flowers on three commemorative monuments - la Tertasse, la Corraterie et Saint-Gervais.&lt;ref&gt;"Le premier jour de festivités (ve 9 décembre) constitue un hommage aux victimes de l'Escalade, ponctué de poses de couronnes à travers la ville, notamment près du monument aux morts à Saint-Gervais." in {{cite web |url=http://www.sortir.ch/et.encore/event.T.96390-la-compagnie-de-1602-fait-revivre-le-temps-de-l-escalade?tsr=true |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-06-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130115184339/http://www.sortir.ch/et.encore/event.T.96390-la-compagnie-de-1602-fait-revivre-le-temps-de-l-escalade?tsr=true |archivedate=2013-01-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Parade==
On Sunday evening, lit by torchbearers creating a special atmosphere, the parade into the town attracts tens of thousands of people.&lt;ref&gt;"Avec le concours de la Ville, les 800 personnes costumées de la Compagnie 1602 défilent devant plus de 80'000 spectateurs qui se déplacent malgré les frimas hivernaux pour admirer cette reconstitution historique, véritable fresque magique pour petits et grands." in http://www.ville-geneve.ch/actualites/detail/article/fete-escalade-2011/&lt;/ref&gt;
Bringing in good order all costumed compagnons, horses, carriages and weapons, the parade explores the old city, the lower streets, and the Saint-Gervais area during more than 3 hours.&lt;ref&gt;"Grand cortège historique de l'Escalade : avec 800 participants, 60 chevaux, tir au canon, salves d'arquebuse, montre d'ordre de bataille : dimanche 14 décembre 2003 de 17 h 00 à 20 h 30". Compagnie de 1602. Genève 2002 Collation, 1 dépliant (16 p.)&lt;/ref&gt;
Along the way, the parade stops in five emblematic places of the city (Bourg-de-Four, Molard, Coutance, Corraterie, Cour Saint-Pierre), places where the [[herald]] - horseman dressed in the colors of Geneva - delivers proclamation - an oration recalling the history of the [[L'Escalade|Escalade]] to the people gathered. The last step in the forecourt of the [[Geneva]]'s [[Cathedral Saint-Pierre (Geneva)|Cathedral Saint-Pierre]] traditionally ends with a bonfire.
With this procession, the Escalade could be the largest free historical reconstitution in Europe.
The next weekend of celebration and remembrance will take place on December 11, 12 and 13th, 2015.

'''Crowd counting or crowd estimating''' is a technique used to count or estimate the number of people in a [[crowd]].

The most direct method is to actually count each person in the crowd. For example, turnstiles are often used to precisely count the number of people entering an event. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-simple-math-behind-crunching-the-sizes-of-crowds/?WT.mc_id=SA_FB_MATH_BLOG|title=The Simple Math behind Crunching the Sizes of Crowds|last=Marshall|first=Math Dude Jason|work=Scientific American|access-date=2017-04-12|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At events in streets or a park rather than an enclosed venue, crowd counting is more difficult and less precise. For many events, especially [[Demonstration (people)|political rallies]] or [[protest]]s, the number of people in a crowd carries political significance and count results are [[controversial]]. For example, the global [[Protests against the 2003 Iraq war|protests against the Iraq war]] had many protests with widely differing counts offered by organizers on one side and the [[police]] on the other side. Another memorable incident occurred when [[Louis Farrakhan]] threatened to [[lawsuit|sue]] the [[Washington, D.C.]] Park Police for announcing that only 400,000 people attended the 1995 [[Million Man March]] he organized. The National Park Police still estimates crowd size for its own planning purposes, but does not publicly reveal the figures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.apnews.com/7afad98b7d78423cbb5140fe810e3480 |title=Inaugural crowds sure to be huge _ but how huge? |publisher=AP news |date=19 January 2017 |access-date=18 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Jacobs's Method==
The most common technique for counting crowds at protests and rallies is Jacobs's Method, named for its inventor, [[Herbert Jacobs]]. Jacobs method involves dividing the area occupied by a crowd into sections, determining an average number of people in each section, and multiplying by the number of sections occupied. According to a report by ''Life's Little Mysteries'', technologies sometimes used to assist such estimations include "lasers, satellites, aerial photography, 3-D grid systems, recorded video footage and surveillance balloons, usually tethered several blocks around an event's location and flying 400 to 800 feet (120 to 240 meters) overhead."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.lifeslittlemysteries.com/how-is-crowd-size-estimated--1074/|date = September 3, 2010|title = How Is Crowd Size Estimated?|work = Life'sLittleMysteries.com|first = Remy|last = Melina}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Balanced_eggs.jpg|thumb|Eggs balanced on a flat surface]]
'''Egg balancing''' is a [[Chinese culture|traditional Chinese practice]] that has since been popularized in the [[United States]]. Although the [[ovoid|irregular shape]] of [[egg (food)|egg]]s makes this somewhat difficult, [[eggshell]]s typically have many imperfections such that the vast majority can be balanced with minimal effort.&lt;ref name=uki/&gt; Despite [[Chinese folklore|folklore]] connecting this practice to the [[Chinese New Year|lunar new year]] in China, the [[Dragon Boat Festival]] in Taiwan&lt;ref name="《台灣民俗與特產》"&gt;{{cite book |author=-{姜}-義鎮|title=《台灣民俗與特產》|date=2002-06-03|publisher=武陵出版有限公司|location=臺灣|language=zh-tw|isbn=957351205X}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[vernal equinox]] in the United States, egg balancing can be done throughout the year and has no connection to the gravitational force of the [[moon]] or [[sun]].

==History==

===Lichun egg===
{{anchor|egg of Li Chun|egg of Lichun|Li Chun egg}}
Egg balancing has been connected with [[Lichun]], the [[solar term]] beginning ''Chinese'' [[spring (season)|spring]] ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|春}}}}) on February 4 or 5 when the [[sun]] is at the [[celestial longitude]] of 315°. On this day, fresh chicken eggs were balanced on their broad end. In [[Taiwan]], the practice is sometimes connected with the [[Dragon Boat Festival]] instead, on the fifth day of the fifth [[Chinese calendar|lunar month]].&lt;ref name=dbfest&gt;Huang, Ottavia. ''Hmmm, This Is What I Think'': "[http://ottaviahuang.blogspot.de/2012/06/dragon-boat-festiva-time-to-balance-egg.html Dragon Boat Festival: Time to Balance an Egg]". 24 June 2012. Accessed 3 November 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
A 1945 ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' article reported on "an egg-balancing craze" among the population of [[Chongqing|Chungking]] (the interim capital of [[Republic of China (1912-1949)|China]] during [[World War II]]) on that year's Lichun.&lt;ref name=li&gt;{{cite journal |magazine = [[Life (magazine)|Life]] |author = [[Annalee Jacoby]] |date = March 19, 1945 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=K1MEAAAAMBAJ|title=Eggs Stand on End in Chungking|pages=36–37}}&lt;/ref&gt; That article and subsequent followings-up started a similar egg-balancing craze in the United States, but transposed to the [[vernal equinox]] beginning ''Western'' [[spring (season)|spring]] on March 20 or 21 when the sun is at the [[celestial longitude]] of 0°. The idea that an egg is easier to balance on the spring equinox has since become an American [[urban legend]], and egg-balancing events are sometimes held on that date.&lt;ref name=gardner&gt;{{cite journal |author = Martin Gardner |title = The great egg-balancing mystery|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m2843/is_n3_v20/ai_18372128 | work = [[Skeptical Inquirer]] |number = 3 |volume = 20 |date=May–June 1996 }}{{dead link|date=September 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1976, [[New York City|New York]] artist [[Donna Henes]] started organizing egg-balancing ceremonies with the stated goal of bringing about [[world peace]] and international harmony.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |magazine = [[The New Yorker]]|title= |date = 1983-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; These events, which often drew thousands of people, are still held annually by Henes in New York City.

==Science==
In fact, the balancing of most eggs on their broad ends is not particularly difficult at any time of the year.&lt;ref name=uki/&gt; No [[physics|physical]] influence of other [[celestial body|celestial bodies]] on the egg can affect its balance to the extent required by the folk belief. [[Gravitation]]al and [[electromagnetism|electromagnetic forces]], in particular, are considerably weaker and steadier than the disturbances created by the person's breathing and heartbeat.

In 1947, after Japanese newspapers picked up the story, the physicist [[Ukichiro Nakaya]] verified experimentally that eggs in fact can be balanced with ease at any time of the year. He noticed that the [[eggshell|shell of an egg]] usually has many small bumps and dimples so that, by turning the egg in different directions, it can be made to touch a flat surface on three points at the same time in many ways. It is not hard to find an orientation such that the egg's [[center of mass]] is contained within the triangle spanned by the three contact points, which is the condition for balancing any object.&lt;ref name=uki&gt;{{cite book |chapter=Egg of Li Chun|author = Ukichiro Nakaya |title=Essays |volume=5 |publisher=[[Iwanami Shoten]] |date=February 2001|language=Japanese |origyear=1947}}&lt;/ref&gt; His findings were replicated by astronomer Frank D. Ghigo of the [[University of Minnesota]] in 1984.&lt;ref&gt;Schmid, Randolph. "[http://www.apnewsarchive.com/1987/Equinox-Returns-and-Eggs-Keep-Balancing/id-0cf1b28fd3bb7e0efa8f91da775ea6e8 Equinox Returns and Eggs Keep Balancing]". Associated Press, 20 September 1987. Accessed 3 November 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mikkelson, David &amp; al. ''Snopes.com'': "[http://www.snopes.com/science/equinox.asp Infernal Egguinox]". 2012. Accessed 3 November 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing on the subject, [[Martin Gardner]] speculated that the folk beliefs inspired people to "try a little harder, be more patient, and use steadier hands" and possibly even to subconsciously sabotage attempts on other days. He compared the self-reinforcing delusion to a "[[Ideomotor phenomenon|Ouija-board phenomenon]] ".&lt;ref name=gardner/&gt;

'''Fiera Milano [[Società per azioni|SpA]]''' is a [[trade fair]] and [[exhibition]] organiser headquartered in [[Milan]], [[Italy]]. It is the most important trade fair organiser in Italy and one of the largest in the world.&lt;ref name=about&gt;{{cite web|title=About us|url=http://www.fieramilano.it/portal/page?_pageid=36,39304&amp;_dad=portal&amp;_schema=PORTAL|publisher=FieraMilano|accessdate=19 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The company started operation on 1 October 2000 and has been listed on [[Borsa Italiana]] (STAR segment) since 12 December 2002. 

Fiera Milano mainly operates in the fields of management and organisation of exhibitions, trade fairs and conferences. It hosts about seventy shows (of which about one third directly organized) and 30,000 exhibitors every year.&lt;ref name=about /&gt;

Most notably, Fiera Milano owns and manages important infrastructures in Milan: ''Fieramilanocity'', ''MiCo'' and ''Fieramilano'', the latter being one of the biggest fairground in the world.

== History ==
[[File:Fiera Milano 1920s.jpg|thumb|left|Milan fairground in 1920s]]
The first fair ground in Milan was opened in 1906, as the area of a [[World's fair]], and in time for the opening of the [[Simplon Tunnel]]. The fairground at that time extended over the current area and the nearby Sempione Park.

In 1923 the fairground, at that time ''Fiera Campionaria'', was moved permanently in the historical zone, of which Fieramilanocity now occupies a part. Western wing opened in 1997, in place of the old [[Alfa Romeo]] factory at ''Portello''.

Since 2000, the infrastructure is managed by the new company Fiera Milano SpA and in 2005 the new Fieramilano opened in Rho. The old fairground in Milan was partially dismantled between 2007 and 2008.

'''Fieramilanocity''' is Milan's old trade fair, located near the city center. The current area is only a part of the historic fairground, since a big portion has been dismantled between 2007 and 2008 to make room for the new ''[[CityLife (Milan)|CityLife]]'' residential and business district. The area is served by [[Milan Metro]] and by the [[Milan Suburban Railway Network|suburban railway]].

Even though the big part of the fairground has been moved to Rho, ''FieraMilanoCity'' continues to host smaller exhibitions with more limited logistical requirements, in addition to events that cannot be held outside the city.

==MiCo==
'''MiCo''' (Milano Congressi) is currently the largest congress center in Europe,&lt;ref name=mico&gt;{{cite web|title=MiCo - Milano Congressi|url=http://www.micmilano.it/ChiSiamo_it.html|publisher=Fiera Milano|accessdate=19 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=mico2&gt;{{cite web|title=MiCo - Il centro congressi più grande d'Europa|url=http://www.micmilano.it/SpaziORG_it.html|publisher=Fiera Milano|accessdate=19 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; with a capacity of up to 18,000 in 70 different conference rooms.&lt;ref name=mico2 /&gt;

The '''Florida National High Adventure Sea Base''' is a [[high adventure]] program base run by the [[Boy Scouts of America]] (BSA) in the [[Florida Keys]]. Its counterparts are the [[Philmont Scout Ranch]] in northern [[New Mexico]], the [[Northern Tier National High Adventure Bases]] in [[Ely, Minnesota]], and [[The Summit Bechtel Family National Scout Reserve]] near the [[New River Gorge National River]] in southern [[West Virginia]].

The main Sea Base is located in [[Islamorada, Florida]] on the end of [[Lower Matecumbe Key]]. Other bases include the Brinton Environmental Center located on [[Summerland Key]] (which oversees Big Munson Island located 5.5 miles southeast) and the Bahamas Sea Base in [[Marsh Harbour]], [[Abaco Islands|Abaco]], Bahamas.

The Florida Sea Base Conference Center has become an alternative training site to the [[Philmont Training Center]]. Most conferences it hosts are for professionals or national level committees, but it also hosts conferences for outside groups.

==Early history==
In 1928, the Sea Base property was the site for the first ferry terminal in the original overseas highway. Cars would board the boat and travel to [[No Name Key]], where the road would continue. The Terminal Lunch stand, later called the Ferry Slip Cafe opened around the same time. In the Early 1930s, the property was known as [[Works Progress Administration|WPA]] camp number 3. [[Works Progress Administration|WPA]] workers were building a new highway parallel to the [[Overseas Railroad]]. The [[1935 Labor Day Hurricane]], changed everything. The entire camp was destroyed in the storm. Most of the workers who lived at the camp were World War I veterans. Many of the workers were being evacuated to [[Homestead, Florida|Homestead]] when their rescue train was washed off the tracks on [[Upper Matecumbe Key]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bsaseabase.org/Resources/Participants%20Guide/Florida%20Keys%20History.aspx|title=A Short History of the Florida Keys |work=bsaseabase.org/ |date=February 1, 2010 |accessdate=March 8, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over 450 people died in the Islamorada area during the hurricane. The evidence of the worker's progress is still evident today. Veterans key, in front of Sea Base's marina, is a man made island made for a highway right-of-way. 8 bridge pilings protrude out of the water about a quarter of a mile west of veterans key, for a bridge that was to connect [[Lower Matecumbe Key]] and [[Fiesta Key|Jewfish Bush Key]] and was never built.

The new [[Overseas Highway]] completed in 1938, included a toll house on the current location of Sea Base's commissary. The toll was removed in 1954. The Ferry Slip Cafe became the Toll Gate Inn and it was owned by local shark fisherman, Wynn Tyler.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.keyshistory.org/lowermatecumbekey.html |title=HISTORY OF LOWER MATECUMBE KEY |work=keyshistory.org/ |accessdate=March 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Toll Gate Inn was a 10-room motel, a bar, restaurant, marina and gas station. The marina was dredged in the early 1950s, at the same time that most of the canals in [[Lower Matecumbe Key]] were dredged out.

==New beginning==
In 1974 a handful of volunteers from Miami, Florida and [[Atlanta]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] came together to develop a high adventure program using the waters in and around the [[Florida Keys]] as their foundation. The BSA National High Adventure chairman, John R Donnell Sr, asked the then Camping Director of the South Florida Council, Sam Wampler, to coordinate trips to [[Freeport, Bahamas|Freeport]] in The Bahamas. Sam, using his station wagon and a warehouse, operated this program until 1979. The original Florida Gateway High Adventure committee members were Paul Benedum, John R Donnell Sr., Spurgeon Gaskin, Ernie Jamison, and chairman Charlie Topmiller. In 1977 over 700 participants were in the program, urging the Florida Gateway committee to look for a permanent location for a camp. Under Wampler's leadership, the National Council received a 1.3-million-dollar grant from the [[Fleischmann Foundation]]. Following some extensive research, the Old Toll Gate Motel and Marina and {{convert|6.3|acre|m2}} was purchased in 1979 at a cost of $800,000. The remaining $500,000 was used to construct the sailing dorms, the quarterdeck, general manager's residence, to repair to the T-dock, purchase a [[Scuba set|SCUBA]] compressor, and renovate the restaurant to a dining hall and office.

==Florida Gateway High Adventure Base==
The camp began small, but started growing immediately. The former [[Scouting in Kentucky|Land Between the Lakes National High Adventure Base]] contributed a couple of canoes, a pontoon boat, some office equipment and one employee, Stu Cottrrell, who became the first program director. The Florida Gateway High Adventure Base opened on May 15, 1980. 800 Scouts attended the first summer. By 1982 construction and renovation was complete and the name was changed to the Florida National High Adventure Sea Base. In December 1982, the National Council of the Boy Scouts of America was given Big Munson Island from [[Homer Formby]]. Big Munson is an untouched, uninhabited island over {{convert|100|acre|km2}} in size, located off Big Pine Key in the lower Keys. It is now used for the Out Island Program, and as a part of the Key Adventure Program. In 1984 the new Scuba pools were dedicated, and in 1987, more land was purchased for future expansion.

==Dramatic expansion==
Since that original gift, there have been several other grants and purchases which have allowed the base to grow. In 1991, the hurricane proof Scuba dorms were completed. John W and Tommie M Thomas made a gift of $70,000 to Sea Base for new staff and conference housing, the Thomas Building that was dedicated on May 15, 1992. A new interfaith chapel was dedicated in 1993. In 1994 the galley was remodeled again, and was subsequently renamed the Donnell Center, after John Donnell, Sr. Also in 1994 the first Corinthian 45 dive boat, the BSA Tarpon joined the fleet. With generosity from [[Union Pacific Railroad|Union Pacific]] CEO [[Andrew L. Lewis, Jr.|Drew Lewis]], a new administration building, dedicated to William L Adams, opened May 3, 1995. After a donation by Frank Heckrodt in 1998, a second Corinthian 45, the BSA Scoutmaster was purchased. In 2001 a new maintenance shop was finished. Sea Base was not done growing; a new facility was in the works. As a result of a very generous $7 million donation from the Brinton Trust, The Brinton Environmental Center was dedicated on May 5, 2001, and officially opened its doors on June 1, 2001. The center is named after J. Porter Brinton, the project's benefactor. The Brinton Center is located at mile marker 23 and it became the base of operations for Scouts going to Big Munson Island. Sea Base was struck with tragedy, when on March 24, 2002 founder Sam Wampler died from a long illness.

==Today==
Many of the Toll Gate Inn's original buildings are still a part of Sea Base. The motel is now called the Annex and houses seasonal staff. The bar and restaurant is now the galley, and the gas station is now used as the commissary.

The Sea Base Fleet includes 16 {{convert|26|ft|adj=on|sigfig=1}} Dusky drive boats, a {{convert|33|ft|adj=on}} Dusky fishing boat, two 18&amp;nbsp;ft (6 m) flats skiffs, four {{convert|46|ft|adj=on}} Newton Dive boats, two Corinthian {{convert|45|ft|adj=on}} dive boats and many charter sailboats.

Sea Base celebrated its 30th anniversary, commemorating the day on February 8, 2010, the same day of the 100th anniversary of the [[Boy Scouts of America]]. In front of the Ship’s Store, a [[Lignum vitae]] tree was planted by local Troop 914, as a commemoration of the occasion with many local dignitaries in attendance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://secure.floridakeys.com/keysnews/archives/index.cfm|title=Sea Base: 30 years of adventure |work=keysnews.com/ |date=February 10, 2010 |accessdate=March 8, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''i1 Super Series''''' (also known as '''Indian Racing League''') was a proposed single-make, single-seater [[sports car racing]] series. The inaugural series was planned for 2012 but was subsequently delayed until the 2013 season.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.i1superseries.com/press/medianewsportal26.html i1 Super Series - A new era in Indian Motorsport]&lt;/ref&gt; The races would have been held at FIA approved motorsport circuits around Asia. 

Organized by Machdar Motorsports Private Limited, the series was seeking sanction by the [[Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile]] (FIA) and the [[Federation of Motor Sports Clubs of India]] (FMSCI).&lt;ref name=i1-launch&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indiainfoline.com/Markets/News/Machdar-Motorsports-launches-i1-Super-Series/5215963907|title=Machdar Motorsports launches i1 Super Series|publisher=India Infoline|date=2011-08-05|accessdate=2011-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
==Format==

{{main|Radical Sportscars}}
All teams would have raced with the [[Radical Sportscars]] SR3 [[Roadster (automobile)|roadster]].

The i1 Super Series would have consisted of ten races at five circuits. Nine teams representing different Indian cities would have competed in the inaugural season to be held in 2013.&lt;ref name=fe-start&gt;{{cite news|url=http://i1superseries.com/press/medianewsportal26.html|title=Motor racing league to start in Dec|publisher=i1 Super Series|date=2012-02-03|accessdate=2012-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=i1-cal&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.i1superseries.com/racetrack.html|title=Race Calendar|publisher=i1 Super Series|accessdate=2011-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each team would be represented by two drivers, at least one of whom would have been a certified Indian driver. Teams would have competed for a USD $1,000,000 prize.

==Teams and drivers==
[[Image:Radical SR8.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The Radical SR8]]
Teams would enter the i1 Super Series by way of a franchise, held in the name of the city that they represent. Each franchise would entitle a team to enter three drivers into the championship. Seven franchises were established, with two yet to be set up in [[Goa]] and [[Ahmedabad]].

===Driver entries===
The i1 Super Series confirmed a driver roster during the series launch at [[Yas Marina Circuit|Yas Marina]] in December 2011, though no drivers were assigned to individual teams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.espnf1.com/fia/motorsport/story/66846.html |title=Formula One drivers sign up for India's i1 Super Series &amp;#124; FIA &amp;#124; Formula 1 news, live F1 &amp;#124; ESPN F1 |publisher=En.espnf1.com |date= |accessdate=2011-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, drivers were placed into a pool, with teams selecting their drivers ahead of each round in the championship.

Subsequent delays to a 2012 season to 2013 would have required a new roster.

==Broadcaster==
{{main|Ten Sports}}
Sports broadcaster [[Ten Sports]] was named as the official broadcast partner of the i1 Super Series, and would have broadcast live coverage of all the races.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5871">The '''International Ettore Pozzoli Piano Competition''', for tradition and amount of prize, is one of the oldest and most prestigious [[piano]] competitions in the world,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.maltaculture.com/page.asp?n=pressnewsdetails&amp;i=12279 The Malta Council Culture and the Arts]&lt;/ref&gt; taking place in [[Seregno]], [[Italy]] since 1959 and held every 2 years.

== The Story ==

The contest was founded by Gina Gambini, widow of the Italian pianist, Maestro [[Ettore Pozzoli]], wishing to honour the memory of her husband by giving musicians from all over the world an opportunity to show their artistic skills. 
Up to now, more than 1.500 pianists coming from all over the world have participated in the 25 editions of the competition that has taken place in the city in northern [[Italy]]. In 1959, the first pianist to win the International Ettore Pozzoli Piano Competition was Maestro [[Maurizio Pollini]], now considered one of the major musicians in the world. 
The last edition (XXVI°) took place in September 2009, celebrating the 50th year of the Competition foundation and was won by the young American pianist, Maestro [[Christopher Falzone]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6287">The '''[[John Locke]] Lectures''' are a series of annual lectures in [[philosophy]] given at the [[University of Oxford]].  They are one of the world's most prestigious academic lecture series, comparable to the [[Gifford Lectures]] given in [[Scotland|Scottish]] universities.  They were established in 1950 by the bequest of Henry Wilde.

The first lecture series was offered to [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]], who eventually declined. According to his biographers{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}}, he felt uncomfortable giving formal lectures where the audience would not be asking or answering questions.

==Lecturers==
The lectures began as an uncertain biannual series, with the first lecturer from 1950–1951, and missing the second slot from 1952-1953.  Between 1969 and 2001, the lectures became gradually more frequent. Since 2001, the lecture notes have been made available electronically.

[[File:Charles Marion Russell - The Custer Fight (1903).jpg|thumb|right|389px|[[Battle of the Little Big Horn]] known as [[George Armstrong Custer|Custer]]'s Last Stand.]]

In this list a military disaster is the unexpected and sound defeat of one side in a battle or war, sometimes changing the course of history.

Military disasters in this list can range from a strong army losing a major battle against a clearly inferior force, to an army being surprised and defeated by a clearly superior force, to a seemingly evenly matched conflict with an extremely one sided result. A military disaster could be due to bad planning, bad execution, bad weather, general lack of skill or ability, the failure of a new piece of military technology, a major blunder, a brilliant move on the part of the enemy, or simply the unexpected presence of an overwhelming enemy force.

One definition of military disaster describes the presence of two or three factors:&lt;ref&gt;McNab, C. "World's Worst Military Disasters". The Rosen Publishing Group, 2009. 978-1404218413&lt;/ref&gt; 
* chronic mission failure (the key factor)
* successful enemy action,
* (less significant) total degeneration of a force’s command and control structure
According to this definition, two particular characteristics are not necessary for an event to be classified as a military disaster:
* enormous loss of life
* having greater casualties than the enemy

==Ancient era==
[[File:Battle of Salamis, 480 BC.png|thumb|right]]
* The [[Battle of Muye]] in 1046 BC, in which a much smaller Zhou force decisively defeated the huge Shang army, that largely defected to the Zhou side. This caused the Shang dynasty to fall.
* The [[Battle of Marathon]] in 490 BC, when a large [[Persian Empire|Persian]] force was destroyed and routed by a smaller [[Athens|Athenian]] force.
* The [[Battle of Salamis]] in 480 BC, where a huge [[Persia]]n fleet was defeated by a united Greek force.
* The [[Sicilian Expedition|Athenian expedition to Syracuse]] in 415 BC.
* The [[Battle of Gaugamela]] in 331 BC, in which Alexander the Great annihilated a much larger Persian army, thus ultimately conquering the Middle-east.
* The [[Battle of Changping]] (262–260 BC), in which 400,000 captured troops from the [[Zhao (state)|State of Zhao]] were massacred after their commander [[Zhao Kuo]] fell for a trick by [[Bai Qi]], the commander from the rival [[Qin (state)|state of Qin]].
* The [[Battle of the Trebia]] in 218 BC, where [[Hannibal]] destroyed eight [[Roman legion|Roman legions]] and Allied armies in the first major battle of the [[Second Punic War]].
* The [[Battle of Lake Trasimene]] in 217 BC, where 30,000 Roman soldiers were ambushed by [[Hannibal]] with army of over 50,000 in the largest ambush in history.
* The [[Battle of Cannae]] in 216 BC, where [[Hannibal]] destroyed the 16 Roman and Allied legions led by [[Lucius Aemilius Paullus (consul 219 BC)|Lucius Aemilius Paullus]] and [[Gaius Terentius Varro]]. In all, perhaps more than 80 percent of the entire Roman army was dead or captured (including Paullus himself).
* The [[Battle of Julu]] in 207 BC where [[Chu (state)|Chu]] forces under [[Xiang Yu]] defeated a much larger [[Qin Dynasty|Qin]] army. Qin's losses mounted to well over 100,000. The Qin dynasty collapsed soon after.
* The [[Battle of Ilipa]] in 206 BC, when an army of 48,000 Romans under [[Scipio Africanus]] surrounded and destroyed the Carthaginian army of 54,000.
* The [[Battle of Utica (203 BC)|Battle of Utica]] in 203 BC, where a Carthaginian army of 100,000 was smashed by 7 legions under [[Scipio Africanus]].
* The [[Battle of Zama]] in 202 BC, when a Roman army of 34,000 under [[Scipio Africanus]] annihilated the Carthaginian army of 50,000 under [[Hannibal]], thus bringing an end to the [[Second Punic War]].
* The [[Battle of Mobei]] in 119 BC, where the entire [[Xiongnu]] army of over 100,000 men was destroyed by the [[Han (state)|Han]] army. This battle and its aftermath ensured the supremacy of the Chinese over the northern barbarian tribes for the next few hundred years.
* The [[Battle of Arausio]] in 105 BC, when the allied armies of the [[Cimbri]] and the [[Teutons|Teutones]] killed 120,000 Romans in one afternoon.
* The [[Battle of Carrhae]] in 53 BC, when [[Crassus]] with 40,000 soldiers marched into [[Parthia]], expecting to be victorious, chose to march a direct route through the desert instead of the mountains of the north. His army was entirely anniliated by 9,000 Parthian soldiers
* The [[Siege of Alesia]] in 52 BC, where [[Julius Caesar|Gaius Julius Caesar]], leading roughly 50,000 [[Roman Empire|Roman]] soldiers, laid siege to a rebel Gaul army consisting of roughly 85,000 infantrymen and 15,000 cavalry led under [[Vercingetorix]] in the fortress of Alesia. The [[Belgae]] tribe attempted to relieve the siege with an army of 260,000 warriors. The [[Roman Empire|Romans]], through the personal leadership of [[Titus Labienus]], wrought a terrific slaughter upon the Belgae; this demoralising event led the defenders at Alesia to yield, ending [[Vercingetorix|Vercingetorix's]] rebellion.
* The [[Battle of Philippi]] in 42 BC, where an enormous army of 226,000 men (including [[Auxiliaries]]) under The [[Second Triumvirate]] destroyed the 187,000 strong force under The [[Assassination of Julius Caesar|Liberators]]. This left the Second Triumvirate in sole control of Rome.
* The [[Battle of Actium]] in 31 BC, where the navy of [[Octavianus]] defeated the navy of [[Mark Antony]] and [[Cleopatra]]. Octavian, left in sole control of Rome, would later become [[Augustus]], Rome's first [[Roman emperor|Emperor]].
* The [[Battle of Teutoburg Forest]] in 9 AD, where Germanic warriors destroyed three [[Roman Empire|Roman]] [[Roman legion|legion]]s.
* The [[Battle of Watling Street]] in 60 or 61 AD, where, as [[Tacitus]] and [[Cassius Dio]] suggest, between 100,000 and 230,000 British warriors and tribes people led by the British [[Iceni]] queen [[Boudicca]], faced off against 10,000 [[Roman Empire|Roman]] soldiers led by the governor of the British province, [[Gaius Suetonius Paulinus]]. The result was an overwhelming defeat of the Britons. There was a rumour of 80,000 Britons left dead on the battlefield, while around 400 [[Roman Empire|Romans]] were dead according to [[Tacitus]], thus ending the British rebellion that had devastated Roman-British provincial towns in southern Britain.
[[File:Julian vs Persien.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Map showing Julian's journey from [[Constantinople]] to [[Antioch]] (in 362) and his [[Julian's Persian War|Persian expedition (in 363)]], ending with his death near [[Samarra]] resulting in one of Rome's most catastrophic military failures in its history.&lt;ref&gt;Beate Dignas &amp; Engelbert Winter, Rome &amp; Persia in Late Antiquity; Neighbours &amp; Rivals, (Cambridge University Press, English edition, 2007), p94, p131 &amp; p134&lt;/ref&gt;]]
* The [[Battle of Guandu]] in 200 AD, in which the more powerful army of [[Yuan Shao]] failed to guard its supplies, and was defeated by [[Cao Cao]].
* The [[Battle of Red Cliffs]] in 208 AD, where [[Liu Bei]]'s and [[Sun Quan]]'s combined force destroyed [[Cao Cao]]'s much larger navy with fire.
* The [[Battle of Edessa]],  when [[Emperor Valerian|Emperor Valerian, in 259 AD.,]] with a 70,000-strong Roman army marched into [[Persia]] to end Persian advances into [[Roman Empire|Roman]] territory. The outcome was an overwhelming Persian victory and the entire Roman army was decimated.
* [[Julian's Persian War]] in 363 AD, in which the Roman Emperor Julian invaded the Sassanian Empire under [[Shapur II]], gaining initial tactical victories, but soon being lured into the interior of the Empire, leaving his army trapped and unable to escape. Julian himself perished and his successor, Emperor Jovian, was forced to sign one of the most humiliating peace treaties in Roman history in order to save the remnants of the Roman army.&lt;ref&gt;Beate Dignas &amp; Engelbert Winter, Rome &amp; Persia in Late Antiquity; Neighbours &amp; Rivals, (Cambridge University Press, English edition, 2007), p94, p131 &amp; p134&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Battle of Adrianople]] in 378 AD, in which the [[emperor]] [[Valens]] was killed while [[Goths|Gothic]] heavy [[cavalry]] ambushed and decimated his Roman heavy [[infantry]].
* The [[Battle of Fei River]] in 383 AD, in which the 870,000-strong [[Former Qin]] led by its emperor [[Fu Jian (337–385)|Fu Jian]] was decisively routed by a significantly smaller (numbered around 80,000) [[Eastern Jin]] forces led by [[Xie An]].

==Medieval era==
* The [[Battle of Salsu]] in 612, during the second Goguryeo-Sui War, between the Korean kingdom of Goguryeo and the Chinese Sui Dynasty. Goguryeo cavalry forces defeated the massive Sui army at the Salsu River([[Chongchon River]]).
* The [[Battle of Yarmuk]] in 636, where the bulk of the Byzantine military along with their Christian Arab allies are destroyed.
* The [[Battle of al-Qādisiyyah]] in 636, in which the Arab Muslim army decisively defeated the [[Sassanid]] Persian army, resulting in the Islamic conquest of Persia.
* The [[Battle of Tours]] in 732. The Muslim Moors marched into France meeting no foes, until encountering the Christian Frankish forces led by Charles Martel at Tours. Despite the Moorish advantage over the Franks militarily, they were defeated decisively by the Franks.
* The [[Battle of Acheloos]] in 917. An enormous Byzantine army of 110,000 men was tactically outwitted by a smaller [[Bulgarians|Bulgarian]] force, causing the death of 90,000 soldiers, 70,000 of whom were Byzantines in one of the bloodiest battles in the [[Middle Ages]]. The bones of tens of thousands who perished could be seen on the battlefield 75 years later.
* The [[Battle of Stamford Bridge]] in 1066. A Norwegian army under king [[Harald Hardrada]] is destroyed by an Anglo-Saxon army under King [[Harold Godwinson]]. The battle is so costly for the Norwegians that only a fraction of the fleet used to transport the army is needed to pick up the survivors.
* The [[Battle of Hastings]] in 1066. The [[Anglo-Saxon]] King [[Harold Godwinson|Harold]] is slain in battle against the [[Normans]] led by [[William the Conqueror]], resulting in the [[Norman Conquest of England]].
* The [[Battle of Manzikert]] in 1071. The [[Byzantine Empire]] suffers a humiliating defeat at the hands of the [[Seljuks]], resulting in the capture of Emperor [[Romanos IV]].
* The [[Battle of Hattin]] in 1187, where overconfident [[Crusader states|Crusader]] forces from [[Kingdom of Jerusalem|Jerusalem]] became trapped in a waterless desert area, and thus became easy prey for the [[Saracen]] forces of Salah-ud-din ([[Saladin]])
* The [[Battle of Kalka River]], 1223. A [[Mongol Empire|Mongol]] army obliterates an allied Kievan-Rus'/Cuman army at a river crossing on the Kalka in the Ukraine. The Mongols draw the Russo-Cuman force out until they are overextended, then attack with their heavy cavalry and destroy the allied forces in detail. The Mongols capture several Russian princes and ritually execute them by crushing them beneath a feasting table on which the Mongol leaders dance and feast.
* The [[Battle of Legnica]], 1241. A Mongol army under [[Baidar]] crushes an allied force of Poles, Germans, Bohemians, crusaders and mercenaries under King [[Henry II the Pious]] of Poland. Poor discipline within the allied ranks allows the Mongols to destroy first the knights and then the infantry. Henry II is killed, as are many nobles and princes, and most of the allied army except for the Bohemian contingent, which the Mongol army decides not to pursue having incurred heavy casualties.
* The [[Battle of Stirling Bridge]] in 1297. English Earl [[John de Warenne, 6th Earl of Surrey|John de Warenne]]'s well-equipped army were trapped on a narrow bridge by [[William Wallace]]'s 15,000 unarmored, lightly armed [[Scottish people|Scots]], bearing the traditional long spears of lowland Scotland. The bridge had been chosen as the point of engagement by Warenne, even though the river could easily have been forded just a few miles upstream.
* The [[Battle of the Golden Spurs]] in 1302, Flemish foot militia defeat a superior French army through the mass use of pikes in assembles into [[Sheltron|schiltrons]].
* The [[Battle of Bannockburn]] in 1314. A Scottish army of around 7000 men under King [[Robert the Bruce|Robert I]] defeats a roughly 20,000-strong English army near [[Stirling Castle]]. The English knights fail to penetrate the [[Sheltron|schiltrons]] of Scottish spearmen on the first day, and are routed completely the next day when Robert decides to counter-attack. King [[Edward II]] of England only narrowly escapes capture, and some of England's most important nobles are killed or captured.
* The [[Battle of Nicopolis]] in 1396 was the rout of an allied army of Hungarian, Wallachian, French, Burgundian, German and assorted troops at the hands of an Ottoman force in modern-day Bulgaria.  It is often referred to as the Crusade of Nicopolis and was the last large-scale crusade of the Middle Ages.
* The [[Battle of Agincourt]] in 1415. A large French army, with a large contingent of knights, was defeated by Henry V's much smaller army, which included the famed English longbowmen.
* The [[Tumu Crisis]] in 1449. A very large force (500,000) of the Ming dynasty were defeated by a very small army (20,000) of Mongols, and the [[Zhengtong Emperor]] of the Ming dynasty was captured. This battle is regarded as the greatest military debacle of the entire Chinese history. There is a legend that [[Zhengtong Emperor]] had been working as a herder during the capture in Mongol.

== 16th century ==
* The [[Battle of Cochin]] in 1504. 200–1000 [[Kingdom of Cochin|Cochinese]] Indians aided by 140 [[Portugal|Portuguese]] fended off an army of 57,000–84,000 Zamorin soldiers, resulting in [[Zamorin]] imperial attempts being stopped and preservation of the independence of the kingdom of Cochin, also securing the continued presence of the Portuguese in India.
* The [[Battle of Flodden Field]] in 1513. A [[Scotland|Scottish]] invasion of [[England]] is defeated, resulting in the death of the King [[James IV of Scotland]]
* [[La Noche Triste]] in 1520. Hundreds of Spaniards and thousands of their native allies are slaughtered by [[Aztec_Empire|Aztec]] warriors as they flee the capital city of [[Tenochtitlan]].
* The [[First battle of Panipat]] in 1526. [[Babur]] sacked [[Delhi]] and defeated [[Ibrahim Lodhi]].
* The [[Siege of Vienna]] in 1529 marked the height of the Ottoman Empire. [[Suleiman the Magnificent]] failed to capture the city, despite significant advantages in manpower.
* The [[Battle of Cajamarca]] in 1532. [[Francisco Pizarro]] and less than 200 Spaniards hold off against nearly 10,000 [[Inca Empire|Incan]] warriors, killing 2,000 and capturing the [[Atahualpa|Incan Emperor]], all without sustaining a single casualty.
* [[Battle of Solway Moss]] in 1542. 15,000–18,000 Scottish troops were defeated by 3,000 English after becoming trapped in a bog.
* [[Battle of Okehazama]] in 1560. Imagawa Yashimoto's invasion of Owari province halted completely, after being ambushed by Oda Nobunaga's force during the night, leading to large casualties, many officers (including Yashimoto) dying, and his army being forced into a rout and eventually disememberment.
* [[Great Siege of Malta]] in 1565. The siege resulted in catastrophe for the Ottoman Empire.
* The [[Battle of Lepanto (1571)|Battle of Lepanto]] in 1571. The [[Holy League (1571)|Holy League]]'s fleet defeated the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] fleet in one of the largest [[naval battles]] of human history. The Ottomans lost 240 ships (out of about 300), while the League lost 12 of their 210 ships.
* The [[Spanish Armada]] in 1588. An English fleet sends fire ships into the Spanish invasion fleet destroying some and scattering the rest effectively ending the invasion threat. The Armada would later run into storms and almost half the ships never returned to Spain, as well as more than half the troops.
* The [[English Armada]] in 1589, where the English fleet was defeated by the recovering Spanish fleet.  This allowed the Spanish fleet to quickly recover and maintained their shipping from the Americas.
* The [[Battle of the Yellow Ford]] in 1598. An English force of 4000 is attacked by Irish defenders under [[Hugh O'Neill, Earl of Tyrone|Hugh O'Neill]] and defeated. This temporarily put Ireland out of English control, allowing the rebellion to spread throughout [[Ireland]].
*  The [[Battle of Myeongnyang]], on October 26, 1597, the Korean Joseon Navy, led by Admiral Yi Sun-sin, fought the Japanese navy in the Myeongnyang Strait, near Jindo Island, off the southwest point of the Korean peninsula.

A Dutch fleet led by [[Michiel de Ruyter]] sailed up the river [[River Medway|Medway]] and attacked the English fleet laying at anchor at their home base of [[Chatham, Kent|Chatham]]. Ending in a decisive victory for the Dutch, and an unfavorable [[Treaty of Breda (1667)|peace]] for the British in the [[Second Anglo-Dutch War]].
* The [[Battle of Saraighat]] in March 1671. The [[Ahoms]] under their general [[Lachit Borphukan]] defeated the [[Rajput]] general Ram Singh`s [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] imperial forces consisting of 4,000 troopers (from his char-hazaari mansab), 1,500 ahadis and 500 barqandezes by an additional 30,000 infantrymen, 21 Rajput chiefs (Thakurs) with their contingents, 18,000 cavalry, 2,000 archers and shieldmen and 40 ships.

* The [[Battle of Narva (1700)|Battle of Narva]] in November 1700, where the city of [[Narva]] was under siege by a Russian force of 37,000 men, led by [[Charles Eugène de Croy]]. A blizzard against the Russian side allowed a Swedish army, led by [[Charles XII of Sweden]], to win despite having only 12,000 men.

==18th century==
* The [[Battle of Poltava]] in June 1709. [[Charles XII of Sweden]]'s disastrous defeat ended his wintertime march on [[Moscow]] during the [[Great Northern War]] and marked the beginning of the end of the [[Swedish Empire]].

* The [[Battle of Karnal]] in 1739 was a battle in which an invading Persian army under the military genius [[Nader Shah]] decimated a much larger Mughal army in a matter of hours and thereby subdued the Mughal Emperor [[Muhammad Shah]], making him a vassal of Nader Shah's.
* The [[Battle of Cartagena de Indias]] in March–May 1741. This battle, fought in the War of Jenkins' Ear, saw a huge British amphibious force of 26,400 men and 186 ships beat back and defeated by 4,000 Spanish troops and just 6 ships. The British pulled back after losing over 8,000 men killed, 7,500 wounded losing 1,500 guns and 50 ships. 
*The [[Battle of the Monongahela|Battle of the Monongahela river]] at the beginning of the Seven years war (July 9, 1755) A small contingent of French and allied Indians soundly defeated a far superior British-American force under the command of General [[Edward Braddock]], the commander-in-chief of British forces in North America. Braddock was killed in the battle as was the French commander, Daniel-Hyacinthe de Beaujeu.
* The [[Battle of Plassey]] on June 23, 1757 when the British [[East India Company]] decisively defeated a much bigger force fielded by [[Siraj Ud Daulah]] and gained their first major foothold into [[India]].
* The [[Third Battle of Panipat]] on January 14, 1761 between the two indigenous South Asian military powers of the time, the Afghan [[Durrani Empire]] and the Hindu [[Maratha Empire]]. The Durrani forces were able to achieve decisive victory. The battle is considered one of the largest fought in the 18th century,&lt;ref&gt;Black, Jeremy (2002) ''Warfare In The Eighteenth Century'' (Cassell'S History Of Warfare) (Paperback&amp;nbsp;– 25 July 2002){{ISBN|0304362123}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has perhaps the largest number of fatalities in a single day reported in a classic formation battle between two armies. The extent of the losses on both sides is heavily disputed by historians, but it is believed that between 60,000–70,000 were killed in fighting from both sides, and another 40,000-70,000 Maratha non-combatants massacred following the battle.&lt;ref name="jgd"&gt;James Grant Duff "History of the Mahrattas, Vol II (Ch. 5), Printed for Longman, Rees, Orme, Brown, and Green, 1826"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tss"&gt;T. S. Shejwalkar, "Panipat 1761" (in Marathi and English) Deccan College Monograph Series. I., Pune (1946)&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Battle of Trenton]] was a pivotal battle of the American Revolutionary War that took place on the morning of December 26, 1776 in Trenton, New Jersey. American forces commanded by George Washington surprised and decisively defeated Hessian mercenaries fighting for the British.
* The [[Battle of Saratoga]] in September–October 1777. John Burgoyne's British Army is captured after the battle by the American Army under [[Horatio Gates]]. The victory humiliates the British Army, and brings France into the war on the side of the Americans.
* The [[Battle of Camden]] in August, 1780. The American forces under Horatio Gates were defeated by the British who were half their size in numbers. This battle in the South turned out to be important for the British General Cornwallis.
* The [[Great Siege of Gibraltar]] in June 1779 – February 1783. During the American Revolution a combined Franco-Spanish force lays siege to a British garrison for nearly four years. A 'Grand Assault' of over 60,000 men, and 150 assault vessels by the besieging forces in September 1782 results in total disaster, with over 6,000 casualties and dozens of ships lost.
* The [[Battle of Karánsebes]] on the 21st of September 1788. A friendly fire incident including drunken soldiers arguing over recently purchased schnapps ending in massive confusion and the loss of 1,200 Austrian soldiers, 3 cannons and the payroll for the entire army. Nicknamed, "The Battle of the Schnapps".

== 19th century ==
* The [[British invasions of the Río de la Plata]]. Taking place during the [[Napoleonic Wars]], the British intended to take advantage of Spanish weakness in South America during that time. While stationed in Cape Town in early 1806, [[Home Riggs Popham]] asked his superior, [[Sir David Baird, 1st Baronet|David Baird]], permission to stage an invasion of Buenos Aires; Popham and some British forces under [[William Beresford, 1st Viscount Beresford|William Carr Beresford]] captured Buenos Aires on June 27, 1806. At first they were successful, and the Spanish Viceroy fled to Cordoba. However, the local Criollo forces under [[Santiago de Liniers]] and others were not pleased and eventually wrested control of Buenos Aires back from the British. While a British invasion of the [[Banda Oriental]] (present-day Uruguay) on February 3, 1807, under [[Samuel Auchmuty (British Army officer)|Samuel Auchmuty]], was successful, a second invasion of British forces in Buenos Aires that took place in late June and early July 1807, under the command of [[John Whitelocke]], proved quite disastrous due to incompetence and other factors, with a decisive Criollo victory by Liniers and so forth, and then the British forces capitulated from the entire River Plate region. Subsequently, Whitelocke was court-marshalled and cashiered.
* The [[Battle of Bladensburg]]. [[War of 1812]], the rout of American forces in 1814 by a smaller force of raiding British regulars and Marines under General [[Robert Ross (British Army officer)|Robert Ross]], which led to the British [[Burning of Washington]]. Described in an 1816 American poem as the Bladensburg Races after American troops ran through the streets of Washington in disarray. Ross was later killed by American soldiers on campaign during the [[Battle of North Point]] but was subsequently honoured posthumously as Ross of Bladensburg. His US opposite, General [[William H. Winder]], was later court-martialled but cleared of blame.
* [[Napoleon's Invasion of Russia]] in the summer and winter of 1812 where [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]] lost almost all of his troops; it was the turning point of the [[Napoleonic wars]].
* The [[Battle of New Orleans]]. [[War of 1812]]. On January 8, 1815, a British force of more than 8,000 attacked entrenched positions manned by 4,000 Americans commanded by [[Andrew Jackson]], and were smashed—losing more than 2,000 killed and wounded, to 55 killed and 185 wounded. Ironically, it was fought after the Americans and British had agreed to peace (the [[Treaty of Ghent]], Belgium), but sea-borne communications were too slow to prevent the battle.
* The [[Battle of Waterloo]]. [[Napoleonic Wars]], June 18, 1815. [[Napoleon]] was defeated by a coalition of Anglo-Prussian forces. This led to his exile to St. Helena, where he died six years later.
* The [[Battle of Koregaon]], 1st Jan 1818: Fought between the British light Native Infantry (500 in number) and Peshwai Forces of 28,000. The troops fought continuously for more than 12 hours without food or water. Peshwai forces finally surrendering by day end.
* The [[Battle of San Jacinto]]. [[Texas Revolution]], April 21, 1836. [[General Santa Anna]], fully aware that the [[Texian]] Army was very nearby, ordered his exhausted army to take an afternoon siesta and failed to post standing skirmishers or sentries. This led to an absolute rout when the [[Texian Army]] under command of General [[Sam Houston]] made a surprise attack in broad daylight, with 630 of Santa Anna's 1400 troops killed against 9 Texians and almost the entire remainder captured, including Santa Anna himself. This also proved to be the decisive battle of the entire war as the [[Republic of Texas]] then successfully negotiated with Santa Anna the withdrawal of all of his remaining troops from Texan soil at the [[Treaties of Velasco]].
* The [[Battle of Blood River]]. [[Andries Pretorius]] and his 470 commando [[Voortrekker]]s defeated an estimated 15,000–21,000 Zulu attackers under [[Dingane kaSenzangakhona]] on the bank of the Ncome River on 16 December 1838. The Zulus surrounded the trekker laager and waited for daybreak. The battle was fought till the afternoon. Over 3,000 Zulu were killed and an unknown number injured. Only 3 Voortrekkers were lightly wounded.
* The [[Charge of the Light Brigade]]. [[Crimean War]], 1854. A British officer misinterpreted an order and led a suicidal charge against the Russian guns. ([[The Charge of the Light Brigade (poem)|"Not tho' the soldier knew, someone had blunder'd"]], [[Alfred Tennyson, 1st Baron Tennyson|Tennyson]])
* [[Battle of the Little Bighorn]]. June, 1876 – Montana Territory. Lieutenant Colonel [[George Custer]] attacks a superior force of armed [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] warriors, gets himself and his entire command killed, the only survivor being a lone horse. 268 U.S. troopers were killed and 55 were wounded.
* [[Battle of Isandlwana]]. A [[Zulu Kingdom|Zulu]] [[impi]] armed mostly with spears destroys two British battalions armed with rifles.
* [[William George Keith Elphinstone|William Elphinstone's]] [[Massacre of Elphinstone's Army|disastrous retreat]] in 1842 during the [[First Anglo-Afghan War]] led to the loss of almost his entire command.
* Both the [[Battle of Fredericksburg]] and the [[Battle of Cold Harbor]] become horrible one-sided battles in which [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] advances on entrenched [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] units result in horrendous casualties during the [[American Civil War]].
* [[Battle of Chancellorsville]]. April  30, 1863 - May 6, 1863. General Lee defeated the Union forces under "Fighting Joe" Hooker, even though the North had twice as many troops.
* [[Pickett's Charge]] by the Confederates in the [[Battle of Gettysburg]] was easily repulsed and, along with the cost of the previous two days of the battle, permanently crippled the [[Army of Northern Virginia]].
* [[Battle of Fish Creek]] has been categorized as a disaster for the [[Canadian militia]] who greatly outnumbered their [[Métis in Canada|Metis]] counterparts, but suffered a major defeat, in 1885.
* {{HMS|Victoria|1887|6}} collided with {{HMS|Camperdown|1885|6}} and sank with the loss of 358 lives after the fleet commander [[George Tryon]] ordered a sudden turn during manoeuvres in 1893.
* The [[Battle of Adwa]] fought between the Italians and Ethiopians in 1896. The Italians were completely defeated and the battle confirmed the independence of [[Ethiopia]].
*The [[Battle of Majuba Hill]] during the [[First Boer War]] resulted in the deaths of 92 British soldiers (including the British general, Major-General [[George Pomeroy Colley]]) and another 134 wounded, while only 1 Boer was killed and 5 wounded, despite the British holding the high ground. The battle effectively ended the First Boer War and remains one of the most humiliating defeats in British military history.

== 20th century ==
* The [[Battle of Tsushima]] – the Russian Baltic fleet was sent halfway around the world and was comprehensively defeated by the Japanese in the [[Tsushima Straits]] in 1905.
===First World War===
* The [[Battle of Sarikamish]] – Ottoman forces attack Russian fortifications in the [[Allahuekber Mountains]] in late 1915. They suffer devastating losses because of their use of outdated tactics and ill-preparedness for low-temperature combat.
* The [[Siege of Kut]] – British Indian 6th Division's attempt to capture Baghdad by underestimating strength of Ottoman forces met unexpected heavy resistance. They were defeated at [[Battle of Ctesiphon (1915)|Battle of Ctesiphon]] (Selman-ı Pak), and besieged in Kut Al Amare. Despite relief efforts by British troops, Kut surrendered to Ottoman Forces in 29 April 1916 ending up with capture of General Townshend himself, many high ranked British officers, and 11,000 soldiers. Around 30,000 casualties had been suffered. This is considered{{by who?|date=July 2017}} one of the most humiliating defeats of British Army.
* The [[Gallipoli Campaign]] – April 1915 to January 1916. A combined British, Commonwealth and French attempt to capture [[Istanbul]] becomes a stalemate on the [[Gallipoli]] peninsula and is abandoned.

===Intra-Wars Era===
* The [[Battle of Warsaw (1920)]] also known as the ''Miracle at the Vistula'' was the decisive Soviet defeat in the Polish–Soviet War.
* The [[Battle of Annual]] in 1921, during the [[Rif War]]. A 20,000-man Spanish force was defeated by [[Muhammad Ibn 'Abd al-Karim al-Khattabi|Abd el Krim]]'s much smaller rebel force, allowing for the [[Rif Republic]] to be established.

===Second World War===
* The [[Battle of Suomussalmi]] in December 1939 and January 1940. The Finns smashed the much larger Soviet army.
* The [[Battle of France]] in 1940 – the Allied Army moved to meet the Germans inside [[Belgium]], believing the Maginot Line would force the Germans to rerun the [[Schlieffen Plan]], but was cut off by a German advance through the [[Ardennes]].
* The follow-up to the [[Italian invasion of Egypt]] in North Africa during winter 1940–41. The Italian army built their forts too far apart so they were not mutually supporting, and lacked tanks or other mobile forces. A British force of 35,000 men was able to rout, during [[Operation Compass]], the Italian army of 150,000, forcing them back {{convert|800|km|mi|abbr=on}} and capturing around three times their own number for almost no losses.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}
* [[Operation Typhoon]], the failed German drive towards [[Moscow]] in 1941{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}
* The [[Battle of Singapore|fall of Singapore]] in February 1942 to two Japanese divisions was the largest surrender of British-led troops in history and destroyed the linchpin of the [[American-British-Dutch-Australian Command]]. Although the Japanese invasion force was ⅓ of the size of the defending force, Japanese air attacks on the city and lack of supplies meant the British surrendered.
* The [[Battle of Midway]] was one of the turning points of [[World War II]]. Admiral [[Isoroku Yamamoto|Yamamoto]] of the Imperial Japanese Navy planned to invade the American navy base at Midway Island. U.S. Navy intelligence had broken Japan's [[JN-25|main naval code]] and anticipated the attack. Japan lost four fleet carriers in three days, due to ill-timing of fuelling and arming of aircraft, American fortitude and good fortune, and ultimately, poor planning by Yamamoto.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Willmott| first = H.

* The [[Battle of Stalingrad]] in the winter of 1942–43 was one of the turning points of World War II. German General [[Friedrich Paulus]] failed to keep a mobile strategic reserve and the entire Sixth Army was surrounded by a rapid Soviet flanking attack. Rubble caused by German bombing and artillery fire left their tanks unable to effectively enter the city. The German troops in Stalingrad surrendered even though [[Adolf Hitler]] had promised they would never leave the city.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}
* [[Operation Bagration]] (1944). The Soviet summer offensive sliced through the Germans and reached Poland within two weeks, and also destroyed [[Army Group Center]], the backbone of German forces in the east.
* [[Operation Market Garden]] (17–25 September 1944). The largest air assault of World War II to that point, involving over 40,000 airborne soldiers, in a play by Field Marshal [[Bernard Montgomery]] to capture the strategically valuable industrial zone of the [[Ruhr]]. Its success hinged on the capture of several [[Rhine River]] crossings by the paratroopers, but delays and strategic German demolitions of the bridges resulted in failure at significant cost of men and material.
* [[Philippines Campaign (1941–42)| Battle of the Philippines]]. American and Filipino forces, commanded by [[General Douglas MacArthur]], were isolated and overran after five months of continuous combat despite advanced warning of attack after [[Pearl Harbor]]. It is generally considered the largest defeat in US history, with over 100,000 American POW's captured.

===Cold War Era===
* [[Battle of Tianquan]], Chinese [[People's Liberation Army|Communists]] defeated much larger [[National Revolutionary Army|Nationalist]] opposition in 1950.
* The [[Battle of Inchon]] in September 1950 was an amphibious invasion and battle of the Korean War that resulted in a decisive victory for the United Nations forces led by General of the Army Douglas MacArthur. The battle at [[Incheon]] led to the recapture of the South Korean capital Seoul two weeks later.
* The [[Battle of Dien Bien Phu]], which forced the French to withdraw from northern Vietnam in 1954.
* The [[Bay of Pigs Invasion]] was a United States-backed 1961 attempt to overthrow Cuban President [[Fidel Castro]] with 1,500 Cuban exiles. Not only were the exiles heavily outnumbered when they reached the bay, but the US-promised air support never came to aid the exiles.
* In the [[Six-Day War]], in response to Arab threats of invasion, [[Israel]] launched surprise air attacks which almost completely destroyed the Air Forces of [[Egypt]], [[Jordan]], and [[Syria]], then launched a series of ground, air, and naval attacks which saw the capture of the [[Sinai]] from Egypt, the [[West Bank]] from Jordan, and the [[Golan Heights]] from Syria, and heavy Arab losses in personnel and material.
* The [[Battle of Longewala]] – during the western [[Theater (warfare)|theater]] of the [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1971]], Pakistan launched a large-scale offensive (involving 2,800 soldiers, 65 tanks and more than 130 other military vehicles) to capture a small Indian Army post at [[Longewala]] manned by 120 personnel and one jeep-mounted [[recoilless rifle]]. Despite numerical inferiority, the Indian Army successfully held on to the post during the night. In the morning Indian Air Force aircraft were launched at first light. This air offensive halted the progress of the Pakistani regiment. The ensuing battle resulted in destruction and capture of more than 100 Pakistani tanks and military vehicles.&lt;ref name="Lal, Pratap Chandra"&gt;{{cite book|author=Lal, Pratap Chandra |title=My Years With The IAF |isbn=978-81-7062-008-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Palit&gt;{{cite book|last=Palit|first=D.

* [[Operation Eagle Claw]], a U.S. attempt to rescue hostages in [[Iran]] in April 1980. This operation was marked by a series of planning, mechanical, communication failures that led to the deaths of eight American servicemen, and failed to rescue the hostages.

==Post Cold War==
*[[Fall of Mosul]], The Iraqi army had 30,000 soldiers and another 30,000 federal police stationed in the city, facing a 1,500-member attacking force. However, after six days of fighting, the city, Mosul International Airport, and the helicopters located there all fell under ISIL's control.

{{Main article|21st century in literature}}
Several attempts have been made to create a list of [[world literature]]. Among these are the [[great books]] project including the book series [[Great Books of the Western World]], now containing 60 volumes. In 1998 [[Modern Library]], an American publishing company, polled its editorial board to find the best 100 novels of the 20th century: [[Modern Library 100 Best Novels]]. These attempts have been criticized for their anglophone bias and disregard of other literary traditions.

The '''Mecklenburg State Theatre''' ({{lang-de|Mecklenburgisches Staatstheater Schwerin}}) is the principal theatre of [[Schwerin]] in Germany. Its main theatre (or ''Grosses Haus'') seats 650 people and is used for the performance of plays, opera, musical theatre and ballet. Designed by Georg Daniel, it was built between 1883 and 1886 after the previous theatre had been destroyed by fire in 1882. The theatre was inaugurated on 3 October 1886 with a performance of Gluck's ''[[Iphigénie en Aulide]]'' with [[Marie Wittich]] in the title role. The complex also includes the State Museum in Schwerin (''[[Staatliche Museum Schwerin]]'') and a 240-seat concert hall, now used for performances of chamber works. All theatres were closed for the Autumn season of 1944, with the staff drafted wherever possible. By German WW2 standards wartime casualties and destruction by bombing in Schwerin were small, in spite of nightly RAF raids and the droning of massive bomber pulks as silver specks on the sky during the day on their way to Berlin.  Americans were the first to enter the town in the spring of 1945, handing it over to the British until the Russians arrived. These ordered the immediate reopening of the theatre, taking great interest in light operas and operettas as an art they very much appreciated, but until then out of their reach in most parts of Stalin's Soviet Union. Not familiar with Central European culture, one saw their well-fed ladies wearing night gowns during the invariably full houses as a substitute for an evening dress.  In the immediate years to follow, there was a gradual exodus of key staff to the West, where few found equivalent employment.  The ensuing vacancies provided new chances for many musicians, who were prepared to stay in East Germany to gain important positions there in their later career.

'''monochrom''' is an international [[art]]-[[technology]]-[[philosophy]] group, publishing house and film production company. monochrom was founded in 1993, and defines itself as "an unpeculiar mixture of proto-aesthetic fringe work, pop attitude, subcultural science and political activism".&lt;ref name="monochrom.at"&gt;[http://www.monochrom.at/english/monochrom.htm monochrom self-definition on monochrom project page]&lt;/ref&gt; Its main office is located at [[Museumsquartier]]/[[Vienna]] (at 'QDK').

The group's members are: [[Johannes Grenzfurthner]], Evelyn Fürlinger, Harald Homolka-List, Anika Kronberger, Franz Ablinger, Frank Apunkt Schneider, Daniel Fabry, Günther Friesinger and Roland Gratzer.

The group is known for working with different media and entertainment formats, although many projects are performative and have a strong focus on a critical and educational narrative. Johannes Grenzfurthner calls this "looking for the best weapon of mass distribution of an idea".&lt;ref&gt;[https://medium.com/narrativedesign-podcast/finding-your-weapons-of-mass-distribution-8a5241c3dc34#.osmbv9fe6 "Finding Your Weapons of Mass Distribution: A Conversation with Context Hacker Johannes Grenzfurthner", published on Narrative Design, September 19, 2015]&lt;/ref&gt; monochrom is openly [[left-wing]] and tries to encourage [[civil society|public debate]], sometimes using [[subversive affirmation]] or ''over-affirmation'' as a tactic.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.monochrom.at/english/2004/05/new-monochrom-content-mobutobe-in-last.htm 2004 blog post about monochrom's project MOBUTOBE]&lt;/ref&gt; The group popularized the concept of "context hacking".&lt;ref name="context-hacking-essay"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.monochrom.at/context-hacking-essay/|title=monochrom: Context Hacking - Essay|publisher=|accessdate=11 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the occasion of monochrom's 20th birthday in 2013, several Austrian high-profile media outlets&lt;ref&gt;[http://orf.at/stories/2163714/2163694/ orf.at: "Context-Hacking mit Eigenblunz’n", January 28, 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://fm4.orf.at/stories/1711701/ fm4.at: "Sei ein Scientist", January 28, 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.monochrom.at/info-monochrom/profil-5_2013.jpg Profil: "20 Jahre monochrom: Zurück an den Nerd", January 28, 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.monochrom.at/info-monochrom/falter--20jahremonochrom.png Falter: "Pubertät auf höchstem Niveau", issue 6/13]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://derstandard.at/1358304927317/Blunzen-gegen-den-Boulevard Der Standard: "Blunzen gegen den Boulevard", January 28, 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://oe1.orf.at/programm/326748 Oe1 Leporello: "20 Jahre Künstlergruppe monochrom", January 25, 2013]&lt;/ref&gt; paid tribute to the group's pioneering contributions within the field of contemporary art and discourse.

==History and philosophy==
[[File:Monochrom 8-10--1998.jpg|left|thumb|Cover of monochrom #8-10 (1998)]]
In the early 1990s, Johannes Grenzfurthner was an active member of several [[Bulletin Board System|BBS]] message boards.&lt;ref&gt;[http://boingboing.net/2016/04/14/the-story-of-traceroute-about.html Interview with Johannes Grenzfurthner about Traceroute, Boing Boing magazine; April 14, 2016]&lt;/ref&gt; He used his online connections to create a [[zine]] or alternative magazine that dealt with art, technology and subversive cultures, and was influenced by US magazines like ''[[Mondo 2000]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://futurezone.at/digital-life/monochrom-das-hacken-treibt-uns-an/24.593.076 Futurezone: "Das Hacken treibt uns an", February 20, 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;
Grenzfurthner's motivation was to react to the [[The Californian Ideology|emerging conservativism]] in cyber-cultures of the early 1990s,&lt;ref&gt;"[http://chaosradio.ccc.de/cre062.html CRE062 by Tim Pritlove: "Monochrom: Das etwas andere Künstlerkollektiv aus Wien", January 2, 2008]&lt;/ref&gt; and to combine his political background in the Austrian punk and [[Anti-fascism|antifa]] movement with discussion of new technologies and the cultures they create.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dkritik.de/interview/johannes-grenzfurthner/ Daumenkino: "Interview über Traceroute", February 11th, 2016]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="furtherfield.org"&gt;Marc Da Costa, "[http://www.furtherfield.org/features/interviews/interview-johannes-grenzfurthner-monochrom-part-3 Interview with Johannes Grenzfurthner of monochrom, Part 3] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120317210019/http://www.furtherfield.org/features/interviews/interview-johannes-grenzfurthner-monochrom-part-3 |date=2012-03-17 }}", Furtherfield.&lt;/ref&gt; Franz Ablinger joined Grenzfurthner and they became the publication's core team.&lt;ref&gt;[http://jungle-world.com/artikel/2014/38/50589.html Bernd Beier interviews Johannes Grenzfurthner in Jungle World: "Das Schockmoment ist nur noch Selbstmarketing", September 18, 2014]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;The first issue was released in 1993. Over the years the publication featured many interviews and essays, for example by [[Bruce Sterling]], [[HR Giger]], [[Richard Kadrey]], [[Arthur Kroker]], [[Negativland]], [[Kathy Acker]], [[Michael Marrak]], [[DJ Spooky]], [[Geert Lovink]], [[Lars Gustafsson]], [[Tony Serra]], [[Friedrich Kittler]], [[Jörg Buttgereit]], [[Eric Drexler]], [[Terry Pratchett]], [[Jack Sargeant (writer)|Jack Sargeant]] and [[Bob Black]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://monochrom.at/mono/|title=monochrom print|publisher=|accessdate=11 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; in its specific experimental layout style.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.neural.it/art/2010/06/various_editors_monochrom_2634.phtml monochrom #26-34 Ye Olde Self-Referentiality] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120505115628/http://www.neural.it/art/2010/06/various_editors_monochrom_2634.phtml |date=2012-05-05 }}", Neural, 15 June 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1995 the group decided to cover new artistic practices&lt;ref&gt;[http://rhysophocles.tumblr.com/post/3887941534/simulacrum-fisticuffs Simulacrum Fisticuffs (interview with Johannes Grenzfurthner), Rhysophocles, March 16, 2011] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203063925/http://rhysophocles.tumblr.com/post/3887941534/simulacrum-fisticuffs |date=December 3, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Erin Kobayashi, "[https://www.thestar.com/article/178430--how-to-be-buried-alive How to be buried alive]", ''Toronto Star'', February 6, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Marie Lechner, "[http://www.ecrans.fr/Pop-Guerilla,3513.html]", Libération, March 4, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; and started experimenting with different media: performances, computer games, robots, puppet theater, musical, short films, pranks, conferences, online activism.

[[File:Monochrom--Johannes Grenzfurthner-and-Franz Ablinger---Pension-MIDI.jpg|thumb|monochrom's Johannes Grenzfurthner and Franz Ablinger (at monochrom's "Pension MIDI", Klangturm St. Pölten, 2001)]]

&lt;blockquote&gt;In 1995 we decided that we didn't want to constrain ourselves to just one media format (the "fanzine"). We knew that we wanted to create statements, create viral information. So a quest for the best "Weapon of Mass Distribution" started, a search for the best transportation mode for a certain politics of philosophical ideas. This was the [[Cambrian Explosion]] of monochrom. We wanted to experiment, try stuff, find new forms of telling our stories. But, to be clear, it was (and still is) not about keeping the pace, of staying up-to-date, or (even worse) staying "fresh". The emergence of new media (and therefore artistic) formats is certainly interesting. But etching information into copper plates is just as exciting. We think that the perpetual return of 'the new', to cite [[Walter Benjamin]], is nothing to write home about - except perhaps for the slave-drivers in the fashion industry. We've never been interested in the new just in itself, but in the accidental occurrence. In the moment where things don't tally, where productive confusion arises.&lt;ref name="furtherfield.org"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

All the other core team members joined between 1995 and 2006.

Grenzfurthner is the group's artistic director. He defines monochrom's artistic and activist approach as 'Context hacking'&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.oreilly.com/et2008/public/schedule/detail/2138 ''Context Hacking: Some Examples of How to Mess with Art, the Media System, Law and the Market'', at O'Reilly ETech 2008, San Diego] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120314093838/http://en.oreilly.com/et2008/public/schedule/detail/2138 |date=2012-03-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or 'Urban Hacking'.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.othercinema.com/otherzine/?issueid=26&amp;article_id=145 ''Urban Hacking: Culture Jamming in the Risky Spaces of Modernity'', book review by Molly Hankwitz in OtherCinema, September 24, 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The group monochrom refers to its working method as »Context Hacking,« thus referencing the hacker culture, which propagates a creative and emancipatory approach to the technologies of the digital age, and in this way turns against the continuation into the digital age of a centuries-old technological enslavement perpetrated through knowledge and hierarchies of experts. [...] Context hacking transfers the hackers' objectives and methods to the network of social relationships in which artistic production occurs, and upon which it is dependent. [...] One of context hackers' central ambitions is to bring the factions of counterculture, which have veered off along widely diverging trajectories, back together again.&lt;ref name="context-hacking-essay"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Community and network==
[[File:Monochrom-Flyer-1996.png|thumb|Flyer for monochrom's publication and community activity, 1996. Drawing by Gerhard Junker, flyer design by Michael Marrak.]]
From its very foundation, the group defined itself as a ''movement'', ''culture''&lt;ref name="furtherfield.org"/&gt; (referring to [[Iain M. Banks]]'s [[The Culture|sci-fi series]]) and "open field of experimentation".&lt;ref name="monochrom.at"/&gt; monochrom supported and supports various artists, activists, researchers and communities with an online publishing platform, a print publishing service (''edition mono''),&lt;ref&gt;[http://edition-mono.at/ edition mono, monochrom's publishing house, project page]&lt;/ref&gt; and organizes in-person meetings, screenings, radio shows, debate circles, conferences, online platforms.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.monochrom.at/liveobstruktae/performance.htm Exhaustive list of all of monochrom's performances, meetings and gatherings since 1993]&lt;/ref&gt; It is fundamental for the group's core members to combine artistic and educational endeavors with community work&lt;ref&gt;[http://fm4.orf.at/stories/1711699/ FM4, Thomas Edlinger: "Besser als besser werden", January 27, 2014]&lt;/ref&gt; (cf. [[social practice (art)|social practice]]).

Some collaborations have been rather short-lived (for example the publication of a 1993 [[fringe science]] paper&lt;ref&gt;[http://monochrom.at/segal/ Prof. Dr. Jakob Segal: "Der Ursprung des AIDS", edition mono online, 1993]&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Jakob Segal]], projects with the [[Billboard Liberation Front]] and [[Ubermorgen]] or the administration of [[Dorkbot]] Vienna&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://monochrom.at/|title=monochrom|publisher=|accessdate=11 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;), some have been going for many years and decades (for example with [[Michael Marrak]], [[Cory Doctorow]], [[Jon Lebkowsky]], [[Fritz Ostermayer]], [[V. Vale]], [[eSeL]], [[Scott Beale (cultural curator)|Scott Beale]]/[[Laughing Squid]], [[Eric Corley|Emmanuel Goldstein]], [[Jason Scott]], Michael Zeltner, Anouk Wipprecht, VSL Lindabrunn).

monochrom is running the DIY project "Hackbus" in cooperation with David "Daddy D" Dempsey (of [[FM4]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://laughingsquid.com/hackbus-a-community-wiki-for-mobile-hack-vehicles/|title=Hackbus, A Community Wiki For Mobile Hack Vehicles|date=17 July 2010|publisher=|accessdate=11 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and supports initiatives like the ''Radius Festival'',&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20160426104353/http://www.radiusfestival.com/vienna/ Radius Festival Vienna, project page]&lt;/ref&gt; ''Play:Vienna'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://playvienna.com/ Play:Vienna, project page]&lt;/ref&gt; the ''[[Buckminster Fuller]] Institute Austria'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://edition-mono.at/index.php?id=11&amp;no_cache=1&amp;tx_sbportfolio_pi1%5Buid%5D=7&amp;cHash=c8c4d36304b6cabf051f71c8fc864015 edition mono and Buckminster Fuller Institute Austria: "How To Make The World Work", 2012]&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[RE/Search]]'', the ''Semantic Web Company''&lt;ref&gt;[http://edition-mono.at/fileadmin/template/images/DownloadPDF/LOD-TheEssentials.pdf "Linked Open Data: The Essentials", edition mono/monochrom, Bauer, F., &amp; Kaltenböck, M. (2011)]&lt;/ref&gt; and the Vienna hackerspace ''[[Metalab]]''.

[[Johannes Grenzfurthner]] sees monochrom as a community and social incubator of critical and subversive thinkers.&lt;ref name="context-hacking-essay" /&gt; An example is [[Bre Pettis]] of [[MakerBot Industries]], who got inspired to create 3d printers during his art residency with monochrom in 2007. Pettis wanted to create a robot that could print shot glasses for monochrom's cocktail-robot event [[Roboexotica]] and did research about the [[RepRap]] project at [[Metalab]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://opendesignnow.org/index.php/article/made-in-my-backyard-bre-pettis/|title=Made in my Backyard / Bre Petits|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shot glasses remained a theme throughout the history of MakerBot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2013/03/08/tech/innovation/makerbot-pettis-sxsw/|title=Startup unveils 3-D scanner at SXSW|author=Brandon Griggs, CNN|date=9 March 2013|work=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

monochrom offers a collaborative art residency in Vienna. Since 2003 the group has invited and created projects with artists, researchers and activists like [[Suhrkamp]]'s Johannes Ullmaier, pop theorist Stefan Tiron, performance artist Angela Dorrer, DIY blogger [[Bre Pettis]], photographer and activist Audrey Penven, digital artist Eddie Codel, sex work activist Maggie Mayhem, glitch artist Phil Stearns, illustrator Josh Ellingson, DIY artist Ryan Finnigan, digital artist Jane Tingley, digital rights activist [[Jacob Appelbaum]], sex tech expert Kyle Machulis, hacker Nick Farr, filmmakers [[Sophia Cacciola]] and [[Michael J. Epstein]], and others.&lt;br&gt;All former resident artists are considered ''ambassadors''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://monochrom.at/english/monochrom.htm|title=monochrom|publisher=|accessdate=11 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2007, monochrom is the European correspondent for [[Boing Boing]] Video.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tv.boingboing.net/2008/08/15/monochrom-bye-bye-a.html|title=Monochrom: Bye Bye (a short film) - Boing Boing Video|publisher=|accessdate=11 June 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160622094216/http://tv.boingboing.net/2008/08/15/monochrom-bye-bye-a.html|archivedate=22 June 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A New Year's Concert of the Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra (1984) could have been transformed by at least one Mackerel Fiddler and Austria's image would have been ruined worldwide. [...] These days, self-production and 'embarrassment sells' have become the golden rules of media, be it radio, TV, or telegraph. Thus it is not only legitimate to be ashamed of ones activity as a Mackerel Fiddler, it is also thankworthy. Failure is beautiful! Disgrace is sunshine!"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.monochrom.at/makrelengeiger/index-eng.htm|title=Makrelengeiger (Mackerel Fiddlers)|publisher=|accessdate=11 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

** A tele-robot remotely controlled via a web-interface/chat forum. The robot was supported and operated by a big community. The robot's basic structure was built out of remodeled [[Lego]] bricks and equipped with a [[Fisheye lens]] camera. The project was the first tele-robot/tele-community projects of its kind.

But that's tricky. If too many people try to control the robot at the same time it is counter-productive. [...] Der Exot is the anti-crowd source robot. The users have to discuss and cooperate via a chat interface to communicate where they want to go, what corners they want to explore, what to crush."

[[File:ESeL.at monochrom thomann grave 2005.jpg|thumb|Georg Paul Thomann's grave in Hall in Tirol, Austria (created by monochrom in 2005).]]
* ''[[Georg Paul Thomann]]'' (2002–2005)
** monochrom was chosen to represent the Republic of Austria at the [[São Paulo Art Biennial]], [[São Paulo]] ([[Brazil]]) in 2002.  However, the political climate in Austria (at that time, the center-right [[Austrian People's Party|People's Party]] had recently formed a coalition with [[Jörg Haider]]'s radical-right [[Austrian Freedom Party]]) gave the left-wing art group concerns about acting as wholehearted representatives of their nation. monochrom dealt with the conundrum by creating the persona of Georg P. Thomann, an irascible, controversial (and completely fictitious) artist of longstanding fame and renown. Through the implementation of this ironic mechanism - even the catalogue included the biography of the non-existent artist - the group solved with pure fiction the philosophical and bureaucratic dilemma attached to the system of representation presented to them by the Biennial.
** An interesting story related to the Thomann project took place once the [[São Paulo Art Biennial]] was underway. The artist [[Chien-Chi Chang]] was invited as the representative of [[Taiwan]], but the country's name was removed by the administration from his cube over night and replaced by the label, "Museum of Fine Arts, Taipei." As the members of monochrom discovered, China had threatened to retreat from the Biennial (and create massive diplomatic problems) if the organizers of the Biennial were thought to be challenging the "[[One-China policy]]." Chang's open letter remained unanswered. Under the guise of Thomann, monochrom invited artists from several countries to show their solidarity with Chang by taking the adhesive letters from their countries' name tags and giving them to Chang so that he could remount "Taiwan" outside his room. monochrom wanted to show that artists do not necessarily have to internalize the fragmentation and isolation imposed by the rat-race of art markets and exhibitions as society-controlling imperatives. Several Asian newspapers reported about the performance. One Taiwanese newspaper headlined: "Austrian artist Georg Paul Thomann saves 'Taiwan'".&lt;ref name="TEDx Talks"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2Rvh8VG3o8|title=TEDxVienna-Johannes Grenzfurthner-On how to subvert subversion|first=|last=TEDx Talks|date=21 December 2010|publisher=|accessdate=11 June 2016|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dcomercio.com.br/materia.aspx?id=64151&amp;canal=50 "A Bienal que não foi vista" in Diario do Comercio, 10/3/2011]&lt;/ref&gt;
** In 2005 monochrom released a press info that "Austrian artist and writer Prof. Georg Paul Thomann died in a tragic accident at the tender age of 60". On 29 July 2005 they staged his funeral in [[Hall in Tirol]]. Thomann's gravesite remains in Hall.

* ''The Absent Quintessence'' (2002)
** Feature films were drastically cut and thereby wrenched out of their genres (hardcore [[porn]], [[splatter film|splatter]], eastern/kung fu, [[zombie]] etc.). These genre films — all of which are characterized by a certain anonymity and a mass-produced look — have been stripped of their "essential" scenes (for example, all sex scenes in the pornography, all fight scenes in the kung fu films). Thus, the material has been reduced to a bare-bones plot that had actually been conceived only as filler, but its aesthetics and stereotypical narrative patterns now make it easy to contextualize. The project tried to analyze these "re-released" shorts and to filter out interesting subtexts.
* ''Towers of Hanoi'' (2002)
** Members of the group entered a bank and exchanged 50 euros to dollars, then back again to euros - and so on - until the money was gone. Afterwards the group calculated how many times you have to exchange the global amount of cash (20 trillion euros) from euros to dollars until it vanishes completely. It was calculated that if this process was completed a total of 849 times using the global amount of cash, 18 cents would remain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.monochrom.at/tuerme-von-hanoi/|title=tuerme von hanoi|publisher=|accessdate=11 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

** In 2010 monochrom created the "Six Feet Under Club". Couples could volunteer to be buried together in a casket beneath the ground to perform sexual acts. In a press release they explained that the space they occupy is "extremely private and intimate". The coffin "is a reminder of the social norm of exclusive pair bonding 'till death do us part'." However, this intimate scene was corrupted by the presence of a night vision webcam which projects the scene on to an outside wall. The scenario kept the intimacy of a sexual moment intact while moving the private act into public space. monochrom's performance can be seen as an absurd parody of pornographic cinema or an examination of the high value placed on sexual privacy. "Six Feet Under Club" performances took place in San Francisco in 2010 and Vienna in 2013 and 2014.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.monochrom.at/6fuc/RueMorgue--January2011-Page34_SixFeetUnderClub.pdf 'Dirty Deeds Done Six Feet Deep', in Rue Morgue, January 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://carnalnation.com/content/58648/957/six-feet-under-club-takes-sex-new-depths "Six Feet Under Club takes Sex To New Depths", in 'Carnal Nation', 2010] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101213234425/http://carnalnation.com/content/58648/957/six-feet-under-club-takes-sex-new-depths |date=2010-12-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://sfist.com/2010/10/02/want_to_be_buried_alive_with_your_s.php sfist.com: "Want to Be Buried Alive With Your S.O. and Make Out With Them While Others Watch Via Webcam?", 2 October 2010] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160602083002/http://sfist.com/2010/10/02/want_to_be_buried_alive_with_your_s.php |date=2 June 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cltampa.com/news-views/sex-love/article/20740921/the-six-feet-under-club-offers-sex-in-a-buried-coffin#.UfjcaG0deSo Daily Loaf, CL Tampa Bay: "The Six Feet Under Club offers sex in a buried coffin", 28 September 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sfweekly.com/thesnitch/2010/10/07/couples-have-sex-in-coffin-buried-in-dumpster-video SF Weekly: "Couples Have Sex In Coffin Buried In Dumpster ", 7 October 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.monochrom.at/info-monochrom/heute-sarg-3.jpg Heute: "Sex im Sarg: Alle sind schon sehr erregt", 29 November 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huckmagazine.com/art-and-culture/art-2/six-feet-club-art-project-burying-kinky-couples-alive/ Huck Magazine: "The Six Feet Under Club: an art project burying kinky couples alive", 31 March 2016]&lt;/ref&gt;

* ''Growing Money'' (2005)
** To quote monochrom's press statement: "Money is frozen desire. Thus it governs the world. Money is used for all forms of trade, from daily shopping at the supermarket to trafficking in human beings and drugs. In the course of all these transactions, our money wears out quickly, especially the smaller bank notes that are changing hands constantly. [...] Money is dirty, and thus it is a living entity. This is something we take literally: money is an ideal environment for microscopic organisms and bacteria. We want to make your money grow. In a potent [[nutrient]] fluid under heat lamps we want to get as much life as we can out of your [[United States one-dollar bill|dollar bill]]s."

* ''Magnetism Party'' (2005)
** In form of a staged [[college]] [[party]] monochrom deleted all the electromagnetic storage media that they could find with a couple of heavy-duty [[neodymium]] [[magnet]]s. monochrom stated that the Magnetism Party was an attempt to actively come to terms with one aspect of the information society that is almost completely ignored by our [[epistemological]] machinery: forgetting. The slogan was "Delete is just another word for nothing left to lose".

* ''Catapulting Wireless Devices'' (2005)
** The [[catapult]] is one of the oldest machines in the history of technology. monochrom created an ironic statement about progress. The group build a small [[medieval]] [[trebuchet]] and used a couple of issues of techno-utopist magazine [[Wired magazine|Wired]] as a counterweight to catapult wireless devices (e.g. [[cell phone]]s or [[Personal digital assistant|PDA]]s) at the greatest possible distance.

[[File:Monochrom's "ARAD II".jpg|thumb|Johannes Grenzfurthner of monochrom acting as a CDC official at a staged virus outbreak at Art Basel Miami Beach 2005.]]
* ''Arad-II'' (2005):
** The members of monochrom staged a fake (public theatre performance) about a deadly virus outbreak at 'Art Basel [[Miami Beach]]', one of the biggest art fairs in North America. monochrom dealt with the networking/business aspect of the art market, the post-[[September 11, 2001 attacks]] hysteria about biological warfare and the media coverage about [[Avian influenza]] (bird flu). Press release quote: "In mid-November 2005, Günther Friesinger visited the Ulaangom Biennial in the Republic of Mongolia. [...] He directly departed to Miami to attend some meetings at Art Basel Miami Beach. [...] There is acute evidence that he is carrying a rare, but highly contaigent sub-form of the Arad-II Virus (family Onoviridae), of which Freiburg virus is also a member. [...] Friesinger is walking around the different art fairs in Miami Beach and is spreading the pathogen. The situation is critical. A worldwide outbreak – due to the many visitors from all over the world – is imminent. [...] We want to find all the people that Günther Friesinger smalltalked to and handshaked with. We want to retrieve and destroy the business cards he has spread. Additionally we must take him into custody and in the event of his death cremation is absolutely necessary."&lt;ref name="Arad-II Crisis / monochrom"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.monochrom.at/arad-ii/|title=Arad-II Crisis / monochrom|publisher=|accessdate=11 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Waiting for GOTO'' (2006):
** The reference point monochrom chose for their theatre-project 'Waiting for GOTO' ([[Volkstheater Wien]]) is the theatre classic '[[Waiting for Godot]]' which is projected into the future by modernistic references to science-fiction. In 'Waiting for Goto' we meet 'ideological delinquents' in a distant interstellar future who are separated from their bodies and locked up in two female students who are able to earn their college fees and make ends meet thanks to this job. The play presents us with monochrom's portrayal of everyday work in a neo-liberal society, double consciousness, the endurance of incorporated contradictions by fragmented subjects, and the exploitation of the living body, self-alienation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://diepresse.com/home/kultur/news/92949/Kritik-Theater_Die-Ausserirdischen-in-Dir-wollen-nur-Deinen-Koerper?from=suche.intern.portal|title=Kritik Theater: Die Außerirdischen in Dir wollen nur Deinen Körper!|publisher=|accessdate=11 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Café King Soccer (Café König Fußball)'' (2006)
** In June 2006, monochrom created the art installation 'Café King Soccer' at NGBK Gallery in Berlin. The installation deals with the soccer corruption case in whose centre we find referee [[Robert Hoyzer]]. monochrom reflect on the fact that soccer has at all times mirrored the [[dialectics]] between the culture of [[subjectivity]] of the [[working class]] and the assertion of [[Objectivity (philosophy)|objectivity]] of [[middle-class]] culture. The former is represented by the collectives that meet in the game, the latter by the referee, an exemplary civil subject conducting the game by acting as its objective opponent. The Hoyzer case violated this agreement. In it, Hoyzer is – especially in the forefront of the [[2006 FIFA World Cup]] in Germany – also a tragic character, because he acted out his inner self-contradiction as an exemplary civil subject in a publicly effective way. At the same time, the Hoyzer case is itself an integral part of the game – merely because of his exemplary immolation as a scapegoat which seems to correspond exactly to his role on the field - and conditio sine qua non of its perpetuation.
* ''Campaign For The Abolition Of Personal Pronouns'' (2006):
** monochrom propagates the creation of gender-neutral personal pronouns. In an activist way the group states that there is a relationship between the structure of language and the way people think and act (see [[Constructivist epistemology|Constructivism]]).
[[File:Monochrom_lord-jim-lodge_coca-cola-light-art-award.jpg|thumb|Lord Jim Lodge powered by monochrom. Winner of Coke Light Art Edition 2006. A limited edition of 50,000 Lord bottles was presented on September 22, 2006.]]
* ''Lord Jim Lodge powered by monochrom'' (2006-):
**The Lord Jim Lodge was founded during the 1980s by the artists Jörg Schlick, [[Martin Kippenberger]], [[Albert Oehlen]] and [[Wolfgang Bauer (artist)|Wolfgang Bauer]]. Every member was obliged to use the lodge logo and/or the "Sun Breasts Hammer" symbol and the slogan "No one helps nobody" in his work. The group's declared goal was to make the logo "more well known than that of Coca-Cola". Thanks to the international recognition received by the oeuvres of Kippenberger, Oehlen and Schlick the Lord Jim Lodge has already attained a relatively high degree of notoriety. Still, the logo's dissemination has remained – despite the international reputation that these artists have achieved – within the framework of the art system and its peripheral importance. As an intentional addition to works of visual art it was in the end limited by their material form of existence. In March 2006 it was announced that monochrom has assumed ownership of all trademark and usage rights of the artist Jörg Schlick's Lord Jim Lodge. monochrom took part in a contest by '[[Coca-Cola]] Light' ('Coca-Cola Light Art Edition 2006'). Quote monochrom: "This puts us in a position to set in motion long overdue synergy effects between Coca-Cola and the Lord Jim Lodge. The only possibility for realizing the challenge formulated in the lodge logo is to use a habitat in the merchandise world as a vehicle of transmission for guiding the message through that world's channels of distribution and into public consciousness. [...] Thus we would like to use the prize as a trial run for such a form of cooperation/competition. Coca-Cola and Lord Jim Lodge – together at last! The symbolic-economic capital of the Lord Jim Lodge and the economic-symbolic capital of Coca-Cola will be brought together, paving the way for a better future. For a world of radical beauty and exclusive bottles in small editions! In the end we are all individuals – at least as long as nobody comes along and proves the contrary." monochrom won the prize. The logo of "Lord Jim Lodge powered by monochrom" was printed to 50.000 Coca-Cola Light bottles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.turia.at/titel/kroeger.html|title=Kroeger u.a.

Kiki is the well-read one, while Bubu is portrayed as a little slow, but often surprises with deep insights. Kiki and Bubu are fond of the ideology of [[Neo-Marxism]] and the series is based on the idea of explaining leftist terms (like [[commodification]], [[neoliberalism]], [[Marx's theory of alienation|alienation]], [[planned economy]]) in an entertaining yet surreal way.
** The first installments were short films (2008), but monochrom also created life puppet shows&lt;ref&gt;[http://laughingsquid.com/foo-camp-2008-photos/ Laughing Squid: "Foo Camp 2008 photos"]&lt;/ref&gt; (2008, 2010, 2014) and a 50-minute feature video called ''Kiki and Bubu: Rated R Us'' (2012): "Kiki and Bubu have some feelings, so they sign up for an online dating site.

In writing the historical context of hackerspaces originally expanding from the counter culture movement and conceived as niches against bourgeois society, Grenzfurthner and Schneider argue that hackerspaces today function quite differently as they initially did. Back in the seventies, these open spaces were imagined as tiny worlds to escape from capitalism or authoritarian regimes. The idea was much more based on micro-political tactics than on hippie's spirit: Instead of trying to transfer the old world into a new one people started to build up tiny new worlds with the old world. They made up open space were people could come together and try out different forms of living, working, maybe loving and whatever people do when they want to do something. In a capitalist society, alternative concepts always end up to be commodified such as "indie music" becomes mainstream. According to Grenzfurthner and Schneider, the same happened to hackerspaces when "the political approach faded away on ''en route'' into tiny geeky workshop paradises".

'''Marcia Lenore Sossoman King'''&lt;ref name="sossoman" /&gt; ({{Birth date|1959|6|9}} – {{Death date|1981|04|22}}) was a previously unidentified murder victim discovered in 1981 in [[Miami County, Ohio]], near the city of [[Troy, Ohio|Troy]]. During the years that her identity was unknown, she was nicknamed "'''Buckskin Girl,'''" after the tasseled [[buckskin (leather)|buckskin]] jacket that she had been wearing at the time of her death. King may have been murdered by a [[serial killer]] who had killed many sex workers or dancers in the area, although this specific case had no indication of sexual activity.

Nearly 37 years after her body was found, the Miami County Sheriff Department formally identified "Buckskin Girl" as Marcia King of Arkansas. She was 21 at the time of her death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Miami County Sheriff’s Office identifies 1981 cold case victim|url=https://www.daytondailynews.com/news/local/miami-county-sheriff-office-release-new-details-1981-unsolved-homicide-case/fmfdENjXMReEHV5VZGPcpI/|accessdate=11 April 2018|date=11 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Investigation==

The body was autopsied on the afternoon that it was discovered. The coroner officially ruled her death as being the result of strangulation.&lt;ref name=still/&gt; She was nicknamed "Buckskin Girl," after the tasseled [[buckskin (leather)|buckskin]] jacket that she had been wearing at the time of her death.&lt;ref name=doe&gt;{{cite web|title=Case File 133UFOH|url=http://www.doenetwork.org/cases/133ufoh.html|publisher=[[The Doe Network]]|accessdate=13 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=help /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=O'Neill|first1=Helen|title=Volunteers use computers to name the dead|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/tech/news/2008-03-29-naming-dead_N.htm|accessdate=23 July 2015|work=USA Today|publisher=''Associated Press''|date=30 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early efforts to identify the Buckskin Girl involved the creation of a sketch of the face that would be published in local newspapers and television networks on April 28, 1981.&lt;ref name=no&gt;{{cite news|title=No identification yet|url=http://www.officialcoldcaseinvestigations.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=1898&amp;stc=1&amp;d=1332267912|accessdate=29 September 2015|date=April 28, 1981}}&lt;/ref&gt; About two hundred leads were followed as a result of the media attention, yet none resulted in any solution.&lt;ref name=still/&gt; She was eventually buried, but her clothing remained in storage at the local police department.&lt;ref name="whio"&gt;{{cite news|title=Miami County authorities still working on Jane Doe case|url=http://www.whio.com/videos/news/miami-county-authorities-still-working-on-jane-doe/vDQhjj/|accessdate=29 March 2016|work=WHIO|publisher=Cox Media Group|date=24 April 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160425044702/http://www.whio.com/videos/news/miami-county-authorities-still-working-on-jane-doe/vDQhjj/|archive-date=2016-04-25|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of the short time the victim had been deceased, it was possible to obtain her fingerprints. Her dental information and DNA were also taken.&lt;ref name=namus/&gt;&lt;ref name="whio" /&gt; In 2008, the victim was entered into the [[National Missing and Unidentified Persons System]] where her fingerprint, dental and DNA information were made available for law enforcement.&lt;ref name="perspectives"&gt;{{cite book|title=New Perspectives in Forensic Human Skeletal Identification|editor1=Krista E.

In 2016, the [[National Center for Missing &amp; Exploited Children]] released a [[forensic facial reconstruction]] of the victim and added her case to their website, depicting her with and without her braided hairstyle.&lt;ref name="BGNCMEC"&gt;{{cite web|title=Jane Doe 1981|url=http://missingkids.org/poster/NCMU/1107106/|website=missingkids.org|publisher=[[National Center for Missing &amp; Exploited Children]]|accessdate=12 February 2016|date=11 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later that year, the Miami County Police Department approved [[forensic palynology]] tests on the victim's clothing, which suggested that she had spent time in the Northeastern part of the United States, as well as in the Western part of the country, or northern Mexico.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Baker|first=Steve|title=New developments could ID 'Jane Doe' found dead 35 years ago|url=http://www.whio.com/videos/news/new-developments-could-id-jane-doe-found-dead-35/vDqjK2/|accessdate=28 April 2016|work=WHIO|publisher=Cox Media Group|date=27 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soot particles were also found on some of her clothing, which suggested she had been in a populous region, most likely near vehicles.&lt;ref name="kennedy"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kennedy|first1=Megan|title=Miami Co. cold case heats up with facial reconstruction, other developments|url=http://wdtn.com/2016/04/27/miami-co-cold-case-heats-up-with-facial-reconstruction-other-developments/|accessdate=28 April 2016|work=WDTN News|agency=LIN Television Corporation|publisher=Media General|date=27 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Isotope testing showed she had spent a total of around four months in areas such as Fort Worth, Texas and southern Oklahoma, spending two months there on two separate occasions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Vallieu|first1=Melody|title=‘Buckskin girl’ not from Ohio|url=http://www.tdn-net.com/news/12204/buckskin-girl-not-from-ohio-2|accessdate=28 January 2018|work=WDTN|agency=Troy Daily News|date=16 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hollenhorst|first1=John|title=Utah firm makes breakthrough in 1981 Ohio murder case|url=https://www.ksl.com/?sid=40545046&amp;nid=148&amp;title=utah-firm-makes-breakthrough-in-1981-ohio-murder-case|accessdate=28 January 2018|work=KSL|date=6 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2018 the Miami County Police Department said King had been seen in [[Louisville, Kentucky]], 14 days before her death.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.whio.com/news/local/buckskin-girl-grave-troy-get-new-headstone-with-her-name/nNQOsP1P8P4v40J6byXJvN/|title=Gravesite for ‘Buckskin Girl’ gets new headstone with her name|date=July 20, 2018|author=Nancy Bowman|work=whiotv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The match between King and the unidentified victim was confirmed on April 9, 2018 through [[Genetic testing|DNA analysis]] performed by the [[DNA Doe Project]] and Full Genomes Corporation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forensicmag.com/news/2018/04/buck-skin-girl-case-break-success-new-dna-doe-project|title='Buck Skin Girl' Case Break Is Success of New DNA Doe Project|date=16 April 2018|publisher=Forensic Magazine|author=Seth Augenstein}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.technologyreview.com/s/611048/the-brave-new-world-of-genetic-genealogy/|title=The brave new world of genetic genealogy|first=Debbie|last=Kennett|work=MIT Technology Review|date=April 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; She had not officially been reported missing, although her family continued to search for her.&lt;ref name="tdn"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Vallieu|first1=Melody|title=‘Buckskin Girl’ identified|url=http://www.tdn-net.com/top-stories/39213/buckskin-girl-identified|accessdate=12 April 2018|work=Troy Daily News|date=11 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; King's mother resided at the same residence and kept the same phone number in case her daughter would ever contact her.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Smith|first1=Dana|title=Cold case homicide victim identified after 37 years|url=http://www.wdtn.com/news/local-news/cold-case-homicide-victim-identified-after-37-years/1116096993|work=WTDN 2|accessdate=13 April 2018|date=11 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She will remain buried at the Riverside Cemetery, but the headstone reading "Jane Doe" was replaced to bear her name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title="Buckskin Girl" case: DNA breakthrough leads to ID of 1981 murder victim|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/buckskin-girl-case-groundbreaking-dna-tech-leads-to-id-of-1981-murder-victim/|accessdate=13 April 2018|work=Crimesider|agency=American Broadcasting Company|date=12 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; On July 20, 2018, a memorial service was held at a local chapel and her new headstone was released.&lt;ref name=sossoman&gt;{{cite news |last1=Ullery |first1=Michael |title=Sossoman given back her name |url=https://www.tdn-net.com/news/44910/sossoman-given-back-her-name |accessdate=24 July 2018 |work=Troy Daily News |publisher=AIM Media Midwest |date=20 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Marcia's father died on January 5, 2018. Two of her brothers, Danny King and James Sossoman are also deceased.&lt;ref name="penwell" /&gt;

===Serial killer theory===

Some investigators speculate that King was the first of many victims killed by an unidentified serial killer who perpetrated his murders in the 1980s and 1990s, continuing until 2004, in Ohio.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://everything2.com/title/The+Stargazer+killer|title=The Stargazer killer|work=everything2.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.websleuths.com/forums/attachment.php?attachmentid=33483&amp;stc=1&amp;d=1367899621|title=Still No Answers|work=The Blade|year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such a serial killer was suspected to have killed approximately seven to ten other women, presumed prostitutes and exotic dancers, in Ohio.&lt;ref name=uns/&gt;&lt;ref name=pb91&gt;{{cite news|title=Investigators of 10 Killings to Meet|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1144&amp;dat=19910315&amp;id=goQcAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5900,7506894|accessdate=16 April 2015|work=The Pittsburgh Press|date=15 March 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1991, a press conference preceded the creation of a task force which attempted to connect various murders in Ohio, New York, Pennsylvania and Illinois.&lt;ref name=pb91/&gt; These cases were originally connected by a reporter who discovered similarities between unsolved murders in the area.&lt;ref name=uns/&gt;

On an episode of ''[[Unsolved Mysteries]],'' the case was briefly detailed along with several other cases connected to the unidentified serial killer.&lt;ref name=doe/&gt; The program connected this case with the murders of Shirley Dee Taylor, Anna Marie Patterson, Hebron Jane Doe (identified in 2017 as Patrice Corley)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sneed|first1=Rob|title=Licking County Sheriff identifies Jane Doe in 1990 homicide case|url=http://nbc4i.com/2017/08/30/licking-county-sheriff-identifies-jane-doe-in-1990-homicide-victim/|accessdate=26 September 2017|date=30 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other murder cases. All of the victims had been beaten or strangled and had some clothing or jewelry missing. She wore no jewelry, had her footwear removed, and died in a similar manner to that of the other victims.&lt;ref name=uns&gt;{{cite web|title=Prostitute Serial Killer|url=http://unsolved.com/archives/prostitute-serial-killer|website=unsolved.com|publisher=''[[Unsolved Mysteries]]''|accessdate=16 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are, however, several indications disputing this theory. The victim was missing shoes when she was found, but there was no indication that she had participated in any sexual activity prior to death.&lt;ref name=doe/&gt;&lt;ref name=uns/&gt; Furthermore, she was fairly well-groomed, unlike many of the other victims. Some, like Corley had participated in sexual activity before their deaths, a factor which indicated that they were sex workers. Also diverging from the theory, Patterson's body had been wrapped in a sleeping bag and was likely stored in a refrigerated area for "nearly a month" before it was located on the side of a highway.&lt;ref name=uns/&gt;&lt;ref name=pb91/&gt;

It is thought that the women who may have been victims of the serial killer could have met with a man at a truck stop while working as prostitutes. In the case of Anna Marie Patterson, there was a suspect, identified over a [[CB radio]] as "Dr. No", believed to be between the ages of 25 and 40.&lt;ref name=uns/&gt;&lt;ref name=sought/&gt; Patterson's husband, who was involved with her work as a sex worker, stated that she was uncomfortable accepting the man's requests, as other local prostitutes, some speaking over the radio, had expressed that they were suspicious of the man and did not wish to meet with him. Police have suspected that this person may have been her killer, and that he may also have been involved in the death of King.&lt;ref name=sought&gt;{{cite news|title=Mysterious 'Dr. No" sought in Ohio truck stop prostitute murder|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1144&amp;dat=19870419&amp;id=gZMcAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6860,829029|accessdate=16 April 2015|work=The Pittsburgh Press|date=19 April 1987}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Earlier, it was presumed that she had been a victim of a different span of killings, known as the [[Redhead murders]], but this theory has been ruled out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Aldrich|first1=Marta W.|title=OFFICIALS PUZZLE OVER STRING OF REDHEAD MURDERS|url=http://www.apnewsarchive.com/1985/Officials-Puzzle-Over-String-of-Redhead-Murders/id-8ad8d3ad5b164d3818827a4768931a2c|accessdate=16 April 2015|work=Associated Press|date=25 April 1985|location=Nashville, Tennessee}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early speculation also made a connection to the murder of a 27-year-old woman in February 1981, yet police never made an official link between these two murders.&lt;ref name=no/&gt;

'''Samantha Bree Runnion''' (July 26, 1996&amp;nbsp;– July 15, 2002) was a  five-year-old girl abducted from outside her home in [[Stanton, California]], and murdered.&lt;ref name=Tru&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/photogallery/runnion.html|title=truTV - Reality TV - Comedy|website=truTV|access-date=2011-08-05|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110903162622/http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/photogallery/runnion.html|archive-date=2011-09-03|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Kidnapping and murder==
On July 15, 2002, Runnion was playing with a friend in her family's front yard&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBjflnEv-es|title=KTLA 10pm News, July 15, 2002|first=|last=NewsActive3|date=3 October 2015|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; when a man approached them asking for help in finding a lost dog. After a short conversation he grabbed Samantha, forced her into his car, and drove away. A day later, her nude body was found fifty miles south in [[Cleveland National Forest]].&lt;ref name=Tru /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Montaldo, Charles.

[https://www.nytimes.com/2002/07/20/us/man-arrested-in-california-case-of-child-s-abduction-and-killing.html “Man Arrested in California Case Of Child's Abduction and Killing,"] The New York Times, July 20, 2002. Retrieved on April 1, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; She had been sexually assaulted and strangled. Police said the killer was "extremely sloppy" and had left behind "mountains of physical evidence connecting him to the crime".

Alejandro Avila, of [[Lake Elsinore, California]], was arrested three days after the abduction. His DNA was found on Samantha's body, and her DNA was found in his car. Avila had previously visited his girlfriend in the condominium complex where Samantha lived, and had been previously acquitted of molesting his girlfriend's daughter and niece. 
Police found [[child pornography]] on Avila's laptop computer, and he had booked a motel room on the day of the murder, where it was believed that Samantha was killed. Avila's public defender argued during the trial that it was impossible for him to have kidnapped the girl, abused, murdered, and then dumped her body 50 miles away in the course of one day as the prosecution believed.

On May 16, 2005, a jury returned a verdict of death. He is incarcerated at [[San Quentin State Prison]] on [[death row]].&lt;ref name=DeathRowList&gt;

All papers from the conferences are freely available on the web. Selected papers are published in a printed proceedings each year. The first conference in 1997 attracted around 400 delegates from around the world and subsequent conferences have attracted even more.

''Museums and the Web'' includes the [[GLAMi awards]] (The Galleries, Libraries, Archives, and Museums Innovation awards) which recognizes the best [[GLAM (industry sector)|GLAM]] work in the sector. Projects are nominated by GLAM professionals from around the world and reviewed by a committee of peers.&lt;ref&gt;Internet:Collaboratively produced art journal wins a GLAMi Award.

The '''O. Henry Pun-Off''' is a yearly spoken word competition that takes place every May at the [[O. Henry Museum]] in [[Austin, Texas]].

Started in 1978, the Pun-Off gathers fans of wordplay to celebrate the [[pun]], which English poet and literary critic [[John Dryden]] called "the lowest and most groveling kind of wit."&lt;ref name="TheNewYorkTimes"&gt;{{cite news | first = Joseph | last = Tartakovsky | title = Pun for the Ages | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/28/opinion/28Tartakovsky.html | work = The New York Times | location = New York City | date = 28 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The event has been organized and run since 1990 by Austinite Gary Hallock. A support group of former and current contestants was formed in 1990 to formalize the unwritten rules of the competition(s) and provide guidance and support for future events. Under the umbrella title of "Punsters United Nearly Yearly" (a.k.a. PUNY) this collection of loosely knit wits continues to be the public face of the event through its website, Yahoo Group and Facebook page. Gary Hallock retired as producer in 2015. He was replaced by emcee and 2006 Punslinger World Champion, David Gugenheim. 

Participants in the annual event compete in one or both of the two areas of punning prowess: ''Punniest of Show'', which features individuals performing a 90-second prepared piece filled with puns; and ''PunSlingers'', which pits individual punsters in head-to-head bouts of spontaneous punning on a randomly selected variation of traditional topic themes.

From its inception, the O. Henry Pun-Off used a four-person panel of judges that offers scores of 1&amp;ndash;10 based on performance, originality, and wit. The four scores were added together for a combined score of 4&amp;ndash;40 for each participant. (Scores lower than 1 are raised to 1, and scores higher than 10 are lowered to 10.) The highest-scoring punster wins each event, with ties being decided by audience applause. Beginning in 2009, however, the judge panel was expanded to six people, with the highest and lowest scores discarded and the remaining four scores added together to form each participant's combined score of 4&amp;ndash;40. This change was enacted to prevent any one judge from having the ability to disqualify a punster by giving a much lower score than the other judges.

A separate award is also given yearly for the ''Most Viable Punster'', a title awarded by votes from each year's participants and given in honor of late punster [[George McClughan]].

==Inspiration==
The O. Henry Pun-Off was inspired by the writings of [[William Sydney Porter]] who, while living in Austin, Texas, in the late 1800s, began using the pen name [[O. Henry]]. By the time of his death in 1910, O. Henry had published over 300 short stories including "[[The Ransom of Red Chief]]" and the Christmas classic "[[The Gift of the Magi (O. Henry story)|Gift of the Magi]]". His voracious vocabulary and love of language endeared him to a broad audience, but it was his trademark twisted endings that always kept curious readers coming back for more. Reading an O. Henry story is a participatory experience. Today, the Pun-Off keeps his name alive by offering lovers of wordplay and wit a platform for their literary shenanigans in front of an admiring, and sometimes mocking, audience.

==Contest==

===Pun, A Definition===
For the purpose of competition and judging, a two-fold definition of a proper pun has been adopted by the O. Henry Pun-Off.

The first and most common form presented is wordplay using [[homonyms]] that deliberately exploits ambiguity between similar-sounding words for humorous or rhetorical effect.

The second accepted type of pun is a lesser used form of [[euphemism]] or [[double entendre]], where an alternate meaning is suggested for a word for comedic effect.

===Rules for Punniest of Show===

Each entered contestant will be allowed to present a pun-filled performance on stage. Puns may be presented in any format (e.g., visual, musical, stand-up routine, etc.), and will be scored on a scale of 1-10 by a panel of six judges. A contestant's final score will be determined by dropping the highest and lowest scores and adding the remaining four scores together for a final total of 4&amp;ndash;40. Contestants will be judged on content, originality, and general effect of the presentation, including judges' interpretation of audience response.

Contestants may use notes or scripts, but judges may take this into consideration when determining their score.

Each routine will be timed by an independent timekeeper, who will allow for audience response and other technical difficulties when determining if 90 seconds have passed. At the end of 90 seconds the timekeeper will sound a signal, indicating that the contestant's 90 seconds have expired and a 30-second grace period will begin. All pun pieces over 120 seconds are automatically disqualified.

The contestant with the highest total score wins the event. In the case of a tie score, the tied contestants are called back on stage to present part of their routine again. After all tied contestants finish, audience response will be taken. The contestant who receives the best audience reaction, as determined by the judging panel and the Master of Ceremonies, wins the event.

===Rules for Punslingers===

(Originally known as "High-Lies &amp; Low Puns")

This competition consists of no more than four rounds of single-elimination heats. For each preliminary round, two contestants at a time will be called onto the stage (a pairing), at which point they will be given a topic drawn at random. The contestant with the lowest entry number will have five seconds to deliver a pun on this topic. The other contestant then has five seconds to respond with another pun on the same topic.

Puns may not be made on the same word within the same context during a topic. A contestant who violates this rule will receive a "strike" and will be given another five seconds to come up with a valid pun that has not been used during the pairing. Punsters who deliver puns that are determined invalid by the judging panel (i.e. non-puns) are also given a strike and another five seconds to conjure a valid pun.

Contestants continue trading puns until a contestant is eliminated, either by exceeding the allotted five seconds or after three strikes. The survivor of each pairing advances to the next round.

'''''One &amp; Other''''' was a public art project by [[Antony Gormley]], in which 2,400 members of the public occupied the [[Fourth plinth, Trafalgar Square|usually vacant fourth plinth]] in [[Trafalgar Square]], London, for an hour each for 100 days. The project began at 9&amp;nbsp;am on Monday 6 July 2009, and ran until 14 October. The first person to officially occupy the plinth was Rachel Wardell from Lincolnshire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/charlottehigginsblog/2009/jul/06/fourth-plinth-protest |title=Fourth plinth gatecrashed, but Gormley is unfazed &amp;#124; Charlotte Higgins &amp;#124; Culture &amp;#124; guardian.co.uk |publisher=Guardian |date=23 June 2008 |accessdate=2009-07-08 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; A documentary art book by Gormley, entitled ''One and Other'', was published in the UK by Jonathan Cape on 14 October 2010. The [[Wellcome Trust]] has posted online at its website its series of oral-history interviews of the 2400 plinthers.

==Opening==
The project was opened by the [[Mayor of London]], [[Boris Johnson]]. Minutes before the official launch Stuart Holmes, an anti-smoking protester, managed to clamber onto the plinth and displayed a banner calling for a ban on tobacco.&lt;ref name="Ramnarayan"&gt;Abhinav Ramnarayan [https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2009/jul/06/fourth-plinth-antony-gormley-trafalgar-square "Fourth plinth protester upsets Antony Gormley project"], theguardian.com, 6 July 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Gormley urged him to do the "gentlemanly thing"&lt;ref name="Ramnarayan"/&gt; and give up his place to the first official "plinther", Rachel Wardell. He did so and descended in the [[cherry picker]] used to carry participants to and from the plinth.&lt;ref&gt;[http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/visual_arts/article6648359.ece Protester hijacks housewife's big moment on Trafalgar Square plinth]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/arts_and_culture/8135718.stm |title=Entertainment &amp;#124; Arts &amp; Culture &amp;#124; Man scales plinth ahead of launch |publisher=BBC News |date= 6 July 2009|accessdate=2009-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Participants==
Members of the public could apply for an hour on the plinth via the project's website.

Asked for his favourite, in 2015, Gormley stated that choosing was unfair but, when pushed, selected an [[agoraphobia|agoraphobic]] woman, who sat in the middle of the plinth, curled up into a ball.&lt;ref name= "AGBH"&gt;{{Cite episode |title= Antony Gormley: Being Human |series= Imagine |serieslink= Imagine (TV series) |url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b06nrc0g |accessdate= 3 November 2015 |network= BBC |date= Autumn 2015 |season=  |seriesno=  |number=  |transcript=  |transcripturl=  }}&lt;/ref&gt; He also said he had liked a woman from the first day of the event, who was accompanied by a Cuban [[mariachi]] band that performed beneath the plinth, and people who used the opportunity to commemorate war dead.&lt;ref name= "AGBH" /&gt;

In humans, [[pain]] is a distressing feeling often caused by intense or damaging stimuli. Whether animals apart from humans also experience pain is often contentious despite being scientifically verifiable. The standard measure of pain in humans is how a person reports that pain, (for example, on a [[pain scale]]). "Pain" is defined by the [[International Association for the Study of Pain]] as "an unpleasant sensory and emotional experience associated with actual or potential [[Tissue (biology)|tissue]] damage, or described in terms of such damage."&lt;ref name="IASPterms"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iasp-pain.org/Taxonomy?navItemNumber=576#Pain|title=IASP Pain Terminology|author=|date=|website=iasp-pain.org|accessdate=3 May 2018|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171109164229/https://www.iasp-pain.org/Taxonomy?navitemNumber=576#Pain#Pain|archivedate=9 November 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only the person experiencing the pain can know the pain's quality and intensity, and the degree of suffering. However, for non-human animals, it is harder, if even possible, to know whether an emotional experience has occurred.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |url=https://www.academia.edu/1388768 |title=A Criticism of the IASP's Definition of Pain |accessdate=2017-10-30 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160822083728/http://www.academia.edu/1388768/A_Criticism_of_the_IASPs_Definition_of_Pain |archivedate=22 August 2016 |df=dmy-all |last1=Wright |first1=Andrew }}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, this concept is often excluded in definitions of '''pain in animals''', such as that provided by Zimmerman: "an aversive sensory experience caused by actual or potential injury that elicits protective motor and vegetative reactions, results in learned avoidance and may modify species-specific behaviour, including social behaviour."&lt;ref name="Zimmerman, (1986)"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Zimmerman | first1 = M | year = 1986 | title = Physiological mechanisms of pain and its treatment | url = | journal = Klinische Anaesthesiol Intensivether | volume = 32 | issue = | pages = 1–19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Non-human animals cannot report their feelings to language-using humans in the same manner as human communication, but observation of their behaviour provides a reasonable indication as to the extent of their pain. Just as with doctors and medics who sometimes share no common language with their patients, the indicators of pain can still be understood&lt;!-- citation? --&gt;.

According to the U.S. National Research Council Committee on Recognition and Alleviation of Pain in Laboratory Animals, pain is experienced by many animal [[species]], including [[mammals]] and possibly all [[vertebrates]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK32655/|title=Recognition and Alleviation of Pain in Laboratory Animals|author=National Research Council (US) Committee on Recognition and Alleviation of Pain in Laboratory Animals|publisher=[[National Center for Biotechnology Information]]|date=2009|accessdate=14 Feb 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170624072010/https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK32655/|archivedate=24 June 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The experience of pain==
Although there are numerous definitions of [[pain]], almost all involve two key components. First, [[nociception]] is required.&lt;ref name="Sneddon, (2004)"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sneddon | first1 = L.U. | year = 2004 | title = Evolution of nociception in vertebrates: comparative analysis of lower vertebrates | url = | journal = Brain Research Reviews | volume = 46 | issue = 2| pages = 123–130 | doi=10.1016/j.brainresrev.2004.07.007| pmid = 15464201 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is the ability to detect noxious stimuli which evoke a [[reflex]] response that rapidly moves the entire animal, or the affected part of its body, away from the source of the stimulus. The concept of nociception does not imply any adverse, subjective "feeling" – it is a reflex action. An example in humans would be the rapid withdrawal of a finger that has touched something hot – the withdrawal occurs before any sensation of pain is actually experienced.

The second component is the experience of "pain" itself, or [[suffering]] – the internal, emotional interpretation of the nociceptive experience. Again in humans, this is when the withdrawn finger begins to hurt, moments after the withdrawal. Pain is therefore a private, emotional experience. Pain cannot be directly measured in other animals, including other humans; responses to putatively painful stimuli can be measured, but not the experience itself. To address this problem when assessing the capacity of other species to experience pain, argument-by-analogy is used. This is based on the principle that if an animal responds to a stimulus in a similar way to ourselves, it is likely to have had an analogous experience.

===Reflex response to painful stimuli===
[[File:Anatomy and physiology of animals A reflex arc.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Reflex arc of a dog when its paw is stuck with a pin. The spinal cord responds to signals from receptors in the paw, producing a reflex withdrawal of the paw. This localized response does not involve brain processes that might mediate a consciousness of pain, though these might also occur.]]
Nociception usually involves the transmission of a signal along [[nerve fiber]]s from the site of a noxious stimulus at the periphery to the spinal cord. Although this signal is also transmitted on to the brain, a [[reflex arc|reflex]] response, such as flinching or withdrawal of a limb, is produced by return signals originating in the spinal cord.  Thus, both [[Physiology|physiological]] and behavioral responses to nociception can be detected, and no reference need be made to a conscious experience of pain. Based such criteria nociception has been observed in all major animal [[Taxon|taxa]].&lt;ref name="Sneddon, (2004)"/&gt;

===Awareness of pain===
Nerve impulses from nociceptors may reach the brain, where information about the stimulus (e.g. quality, location, and intensity), and affect (unpleasantness) are registered. Though the brain activity involved has been studied, the brain processes underlying conscious awareness are not well understood.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

==Adaptive value==

The [[Fitness (biology)|adaptive value]] of nociception is obvious; an organism detecting a noxious stimulus immediately withdraws the limb, appendage or entire body from the noxious stimulus and thereby avoids further (potential) injury. However, a characteristic of pain (in mammals at least) is that pain can result in [[hyperalgesia]] (a heightened sensitivity to noxious stimuli) and [[allodynia]] (a heightened sensitivity to non-noxious stimuli). When this heightened sensitisation occurs, the adaptive value is less clear. First, the pain arising from the heightened sensitisation can be disproportionate to the actual tissue damage caused. Second, the heightened sensitisation may also become chronic, persisting well beyond the tissues healing. This can mean that rather than the actual tissue damage causing pain, it is the pain due to the heightened sensitisation that becomes the concern. This means the sensitisation process is sometimes termed [[maladaptive]]. It is often suggested hyperalgesia and allodynia assist organisms to protect themselves during healing, but experimental evidence to support this has been lacking.&lt;ref name="Price"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Price, T.J.  |author2=Dussor, G. |lastauthoramp=yes |year=2014|title=Evolution: the advantage of 'maladaptive'pain plasticity|journal=Current Biology|volume=24|issue=10|pages=R384–R386 |doi=10.1016/j.cub.2014.04.011 |pmid=24845663 |pmc=4295114}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Oxford"&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803100128206|publisher=Oxford Reference|title=Maladaptive pain|accessdate=May 16, 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160515151057/http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803100128206|archivedate=15 May 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, the adaptive value of sensitisation due to injury was tested using the predatory interactions between [[longfin inshore squid]] (''Doryteuthis pealeii'') and [[black sea bass]] (''Centropristis striata'') which are natural predators of this squid. If injured squid are targeted by a bass, they began their defensive behaviours sooner (indicated by greater alert distances and longer flight initiation distances) than uninjured squid. If anaesthetic (1% ethanol and MgCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) is administered prior to the injury, this prevents the sensitisation and blocks the behavioural effect. The authors claim this study is the first experimental evidence to support the argument that nociceptive sensitisation is actually an adaptive response to injuries.&lt;ref name="Crooketal2014"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Crook, R.J., Dickson, K., Hanlon, R.T. and Walters, E.T.|year=2014|title=Nociceptive sensitization reduces predation risk|journal=Current Biology|volume=24|issue=10|pages=1121–1125|doi=10.1016/j.cub.2014.03.043|pmid=24814149}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Argument-by-analogy==
To assess the capacity of other species to consciously suffer pain we resort to [[argument#Argument by analogy|argument-by-analogy]]. That is, if an animal responds to a stimulus the way a human does, it is likely to have had an analogous experience. If we stick a pin in a chimpanzee's finger and she rapidly withdraws her hand, we use argument-by-analogy and infer that like us, she felt pain. It might be argued that consistency requires us infer, also, that a cockroach experiences conscious pain when it writhes after being stuck with a pin. The usual counter-argument is that although the physiology of consciousness is not understood, it clearly involves complex brain processes not present in relatively simple organisms.&lt;ref name="Sherwin, 2001" /&gt; Other analogies have been pointed out.  For example, when given a choice of foods, rats&lt;ref name="Colpaert et al., (2001)"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Colpaert | first1 = F.C. | last2 = Tarayre | first2 = J.P. | last3 = Alliaga | first3 = M. | last4 = Slot | first4 = L.A.B. | last5 = Attal | first5 = N. | last6 = Koek | first6 = W. | year = 2001 | title = Opiate self-administration as a measure of chronic nociceptive pain in arthritic rats | url = | journal = Pain | volume = 91 | issue = 1–2| pages = 33–45 | doi=10.1016/s0304-3959(00)00413-9| pmid = 11240076 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and chickens&lt;ref name="Danbury et al., (2000)"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Danbury | first1 = T.C. | last2 = Weeks | first2 = C.A. | last3 = Chambers | first3 = J.P. | last4 = Waterman-Pearson | first4 = A.E. | last5 = Kestin | first5 = S.C. | year = 2000 | title = Self-selection of the analgesic drug carprofen by lame broiler chickens | doi = 10.1136/vr.146.11.307 | journal = Veterinary Record | volume = 146 | issue = 11| pages = 307–311 }}&lt;/ref&gt; with clinical symptoms of pain will consume more of an analgesic-containing food than animals not in pain. Additionally, the consumption of the analgesic [[carprofen]] in lame chickens was positively correlated to the severity of lameness, and consumption resulted in an improved gait. Such [[anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] arguments face the criticism that physical reactions indicating pain may be neither the cause nor result of conscious states, and the approach is subject to criticism of anthropomorphic interpretation.  For example, a single-celled organism such as an amoeba may writhe after being exposed to noxious stimuli despite the absence of nociception.

==History==
{{see also|Animal consciousness}}

The idea that animals might not experience [[pain]] or [[suffering]] as [[human being|humans]] do traces back at least to the 17th-century French philosopher, [[René Descartes]], who argued that animals lack [[consciousness]].&lt;ref name=Carbone149&gt;Carbone, Larry.

The ability to experience pain in an animal, or another human for that matter, cannot be determined directly but it may be inferred through analogous physiological and behavioral reactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Abbott FV, Franklin KB, Westbrook RF |title=The formalin test: scoring properties of the first and second phases of the pain response in rats |journal=Pain |volume=60 |issue=1 |pages=91–102 |date=January 1995 |pmid=7715946 |doi=10.1016/0304-3959(94)00095-V |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/0304-3959(94)00095-V |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171102174334/http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/0304-3959(94)00095-V |archivedate=2 November 2017 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although many animals share similar mechanisms of pain detection to those of humans, have similar areas of the brain involved in processing pain, and show similar pain behaviours, it is notoriously difficult to assess how animals actually experience pain.&lt;ref name=PAIN&gt;{{cite web|last=Sneddon|first=Lynne|title=Can animals feel pain?|url=http://www.wellcome.ac.uk/en/pain/microsite/culture2.html|publisher=PAIN|accessdate=18 March 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120413122654/http://www.wellcome.ac.uk/en/pain/microsite/culture2.html|archivedate=13 April 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nociception===
Nociceptive nerves, which preferentially detect (potential) injury-causing stimuli, have been identified in a variety of animals, including invertebrates. The medicinal [[leech]], ''[[Hirudo medicinalis]],'' and [[sea slug]] are classic model systems for studying nociception.&lt;ref name=PAIN/&gt; Many other vertebrate and invertebrate animals also show nociceptive reflex responses similar to our own.

===Pain===
Many animals also exhibit more complex behavioural and physiological changes indicative of the ability to experience pain: they eat less food, their normal behaviour is disrupted, their social behaviour is suppressed, they may adopt unusual behaviour patterns, they may emit characteristic distress calls, experience respiratory and cardiovascular changes, as well as inflammation and release of stress hormones.&lt;ref name=PAIN/&gt;

Some criteria that may indicate the potential of another species to feel pain include:&lt;ref name = Elwood&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Elwood | first1 = R.W. | last2 = Barr | first2 = S. | last3 = Patterson | first3 = L. | year = 2009 | title = Pain and stress in crustaceans? | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168159109000409 | journal = Applied Animal Behaviour Science | volume = 118 | issue = 3| pages = 128–136 | doi=10.1016/j.applanim.2009.02.018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A typical human cutaneous nerve contains 83% [[Group C nerve fiber|C type trauma receptors]] (the type responsible for transmitting signals described by humans as excruciating pain); the same nerves in humans with [[congenital insensitivity to pain]] have only 24-28% C type receptors.&lt;ref name=Rose2012&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rose | first1 = JD | last2 = Arlinghaus | first2 = R | last3 = Cooke | first3 = SJ | last4 = Diggles | first4 = BK | last5 = Sawynok | first5 = W | last6 = Stevens | first6 = ED | last7 = Wynne | first7 = CDL | year = 2012 | title = Can fish really feel pain? | url = http://www.vapaa-ajankalastaja.fi/files/Tiedostot/RoseEtAl_FishFish_online_2012.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Fish and Fisheries | volume = 15 | issue = 1 | pages = 97–133 | doi = 10.1111/faf.12010 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160304060805/http://www.vapaa-ajankalastaja.fi/files/Tiedostot/RoseEtAl_FishFish_online_2012.pdf | archivedate = 4 March 2016 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The rainbow trout has about 5% C type fibres, while sharks and rays have 0%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Snow | first1 = P.J. | last2 = Plenderleith | first2 = M.B. | last3 = Wright | first3 = L.L. | year = 1993 | title = Quantitative study of primary sensory neurone populations of three species of elasmobranch fish | url = | journal = Journal of Comparative Neurology | volume = 334 | issue = 1| pages = 97–103 | doi=10.1002/cne.903340108| pmid = 8408762 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, fish have been shown to have sensory neurons that are sensitive to damaging stimuli and are physiologically identical to human nociceptors.&lt;ref name=fish_pain&gt;{{cite journal|last= L.U.

===Veterinary medicine===
[[Veterinary medicine]] uses, for actual or potential animal pain, the same [[analgesic]]s and [[anesthetic]]s as used in humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Viñuela-Fernández I, Jones E, Welsh EM, Fleetwood-Walker SM |title=Pain mechanisms and their implication for the management of pain in farm and companion animals |journal=Vet.

===Dolorimetry===
[[Dolorimeter|Dolorimetry]] (''dolor'': Latin: pain, grief) is the measurement of the pain response in animals, including humans. It is practiced occasionally in medicine, as a diagnostic tool, and is regularly used in research into the basic science of pain, and in testing the efficacy of analgesics. Non-human animal pain measurement techniques include the [[Randall-Selitto test|paw pressure test]], [[tail flick test]], [[hot plate test]] and [[Grimace scale (animals)|grimace scales]].

===Laboratory animals===
{{See also|Animal testing regulations}}
Animals are kept in laboratories for a wide range of reasons, some of which may involve pain, suffering or distress, whilst others (e.g. many of those involved in breeding) will not.

In the U.S., researchers are not required to provide laboratory animals with pain relief if the administration of such drugs would interfere with their experiment. Laboratory animal veterinarian Larry Carbone writes, “Without question, present public policy allows humans to cause laboratory animals unalleviated pain. The AWA, the ''Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals'', and current Public Health Service policy all allow for the conduct of what are often called “Category E” studies – experiments in which animals are expected to undergo significant pain or distress that will be left untreated because treatments for pain would be expected to interfere with the experiment.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Carbone|first1=L|title=Pain in Laboratory Animals: The Ethical and Regulatory Imperatives|journal=PLOS ONE|date=7 September 2011|volume=6|issue=9|pages=e21578|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0021578|pmid=21915253|pmc=3168441|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Severity scales ====

Eleven countries have national classification systems of pain and suffering experienced by animals used in research: Australia, Canada, Finland, Germany, The Republic of Ireland, The Netherlands, New Zealand, Poland, Sweden, Switzerland, and the UK. The US also has a mandated national scientific animal-use classification system, but it is markedly different from other countries in that it reports on whether pain-relieving drugs were required and/or used.&lt;ref name="Fenwick et al., 2011"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fenwick | first1 = N. | last2 = Ormandy | first2 = E. | last3 = Gauthier | first3 = C. | last4 = Griffin | first4 = G. | year = 2011 | title = Classifying the severity of scientific animal use: a review of international systems | url = | journal = Animal Welfare | volume = 20 | issue = | pages = 281–301 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first severity scales were implemented in 1986 by Finland and the UK. The number of severity categories ranges between 3 (Sweden and Finland) and 9 (Australia). In the UK, research projects are classified as "mild", "moderate", and "substantial" in terms of the suffering the researchers conducting the study say they may cause; a fourth category of "unclassified" means the animal was anesthetized and killed without recovering consciousness. It should be remembered that in the UK system, many research projects (e.g. transgenic breeding, feeding distasteful food) will require a license under the [[Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986]], but may cause little or no pain or suffering. In December 2001, 39 percent (1, 296) of project licenses in force were classified as "mild", 55 percent (1, 811) as "moderate", two percent (63) as "substantial", and 4 percent (139) as "unclassified".&lt;ref name=RyderSinger&gt;[[Richard D. Ryder|Ryder, Richard D.]] "Speciesism in the laboratory, " in [[Peter Singer|Singer, Peter]]. ''In Defense of Animals: The Second Wave''. Blackwell, 2006. p. 99.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, of the project licenses issued, 35 percent (187) were classified as "mild", 61 percent (330) as "moderate", 2 percent (13) as "severe" and 2 percent (11) as unclassified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/publications/science-research-statistics/research-statistics/science-research/spanimals09/spanimals09?view=Binary|archive-url=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20110922113036/http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/publications/science-research-statistics/research-statistics/science-research/spanimals09/spanimals09?view=Binary|dead-url=yes|archive-date=22 September 2011|title=Home Office Statistics |accessdate=31 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the US, the ''Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals'' defines the parameters for animal testing regulations. It states, "The ability to experience and respond to pain is widespread in the animal kingdom...Pain is a stressor and, if not relieved, can lead to unacceptable levels of stress and distress in animals. "&lt;ref&gt;Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, ILAR, National Research Council, 1996 copyright, pg 64&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Guide'' states that the ability to recognize the symptoms of pain in different species is essential for the people caring for and using animals. Accordingly, all issues of animal pain and distress, and their potential treatment with analgesia and anesthesia, are required regulatory issues for [[Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee|animal protocol approval]].

'''Samhain''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|ɑː|w|ɪ|n|,_|ˈ|s|aʊ|ɪ|n}}; {{IPA-ga|ˈsˠəuɪnʲ|lang}} {{IPA-gd|ˈs̪ãũ.ɪɲ|lang}}) is a [[Gaels|Gaelic]] festival marking the end of the [[harvest]] season and the beginning of winter or the "[[Celtic calendar#Medieval Irish and Welsh calendars|darker half]]" of the year. Traditionally, it is celebrated from 31 October to 1 November, as the [[Celtic calendar#Medieval Irish and Welsh calendars|Celtic day]] began and ended at sunset. This is about halfway between the [[September equinox|autumn equinox]] and the [[December solstice|winter solstice]]. It is one of the four Gaelic seasonal festivals, along with [[Imbolc]], [[Bealtaine]] and [[Lughnasadh]]. Historically, it was widely observed throughout [[Ireland]], [[Scotland]] and the [[Isle of Man]]. Similar festivals are held at the same time of year in other [[Celts|Celtic]] lands; for example the [[Brythonic languages|Brythonic]] [[Calan Gaeaf]] (in [[Wales]]), [[Allantide|Kalan Gwav]] (in [[Cornwall]]), and Kalan Goañv (in [[Brittany]]), both [[Celtic nations|Celtic]] branches are roughly as old as each other.

Samhain is believed to have [[Celtic polytheism|Celtic pagan]] origins and there is evidence it has been an important date since ancient times. Some [[Prehistoric Ireland#Neolithic (4000–2500 BC)|Neolithic]] [[passage tomb]]s in Ireland are aligned with the sunrise around the time of Samhain. It is mentioned in some of the [[Early Irish literature|earliest Irish literature]] and many important events in [[Irish mythology]] happen or begin on Samhain. It was the time when cattle were brought back down from the summer pastures and when livestock were slaughtered for the winter. As at [[Bealtaine]], special [[bonfire]]s were lit. These were deemed to have protective and cleansing powers and there were rituals involving them.&lt;ref name="O'Driscoll"&gt;O'Driscoll, Robert (ed.) (1981) ''The Celtic Consciousness'' New York: Braziller {{ISBN|0-8076-1136-0}} pp. 197–216: Ross, Anne "Material Culture, Myth and Folk Memory" (on modern survivals); pp. 217–42: Danaher, Kevin "Irish Folk Tradition and the Celtic Calendar" (on specific customs and rituals)&lt;/ref&gt; Like Bealtaine, Samhain was seen as a [[Liminality|liminal]] time, when the boundary between this world and the [[Celtic Otherworld|Otherworld]] could more easily be crossed. This meant the ''[[Aos Sí]]'', the 'spirits' or '[[fairy|fairies]]', could more easily come into our world. Most scholars see the ''Aos Sí'' as remnants of the pagan gods and nature spirits. At Samhain, it was believed that the ''Aos Sí'' needed to be [[Propitiation|propitiated]] to ensure that the people and their livestock survived the winter. Offerings of food and drink were left outside for them. The souls of the dead were also thought to revisit their homes seeking hospitality. Feasts were had, at which the souls of dead kin were beckoned to attend and a place set at the table for them. [[Mummers Play|Mumming]] and [[guising]] were part of the festival, and involved people going door-to-door in costume (or in disguise), often reciting verses in exchange for food. The costumes may have been a way of imitating, and disguising oneself from, the ''Aos Sí''. [[Divination]] rituals and games were also a big part of the festival and often involved nuts and apples. In the late 19th century, [[Sir John Rhys]] and [[James George Frazer|Sir James Frazer]] suggested that it was the "Celtic New Year", and this view has been repeated by some other scholars.&lt;ref name="Stations363"&gt;Hutton, Ronald (1996) ''Stations of the Sun: A History of the Ritual Year in Britain''. Oxford: Oxford University Press {{ISBN|0-19-288045-4}}, p. 363.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 9th century [[AD]], the [[Western Christianity|Western Christian church]] shifted the date of [[All Saints' Day]] to 1 November, while 2 November later became [[All Souls' Day]]. Over time, Samhain and All Saints'/All Souls' [[Syncretism#Religious Syncretism|merged]] to create the modern [[Halloween]].&lt;ref name = "OED"&gt;{{Cite book| first = John | last = Simpson |author2=Weiner, Edmund  | title = Oxford English Dictionary | edition = second | year = 1989 | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = London|isbn = 0-19-861186-2 | oclc = 17648714}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historians have used the name 'Samhain' to refer to Gaelic 'Halloween' customs up until the 19th century.&lt;ref name=hutton365-369&gt;[[Ronald Hutton|Hutton, Ronald]]. ''The Stations of the Sun: A History of the Ritual Year in Britain''. Oxford University Press, 1996. pp. 365–69&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the later 20th century, [[Celtic Neopaganism|Celtic neopagans]] and [[Wicca]]ns have observed Samhain, or something based on it, as a religious holiday.&lt;ref name="Hutton"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Hutton |first=Ronald |authorlink=Ronald Hutton |title=The Pagan Religions of the Ancient British Isles: Their Nature and Legacy |publisher=Oxford: Blackwell |isbn=0-631-18946-7 |pages=327–41}}&lt;/ref&gt; Neopagans in the Southern Hemisphere often celebrate Samhain at the other end of the year (about 1 May).

==Etymology==
In [[Irish language|Modern Irish]] as well as [[Scottish Gaelic]] the name is {{lang|ga|Samhain}}. Older forms of the word include the Scottish Gaelic spellings {{lang|gd|Samhainn}} and {{lang|gd|Samhuinn}}.&lt;ref&gt;[[Alexander Macbain|Macbain, Alexander]] (1911). [http://www.ceantar.org/Dicts/MB2/mb32.html ''An Etymological Dictionary of the Gaelic Language''].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.edinburghnews.scotsman.com/our-region/edinburgh/samhuinn-halloween-festival-to-be-staged-on-edinburgh-s-calton-hill-1-4805463 "Samhuinn Halloween festival to be staged on Edinburgh’s Calton Hill"]. ''[[The Scotsman]]'', 26 September 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.faclair.com/ViewDictionaryEntry.aspx?ID=58CC31EB610DF1537DEDAF39B763D976 "Samhainn"]. [[Scottish Gaelic dictionaries|Am Faclair Beag]].&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Manx Gaelic]] the name is {{lang|gv|Sauin}}. 

These are also the names of November in each language, shortened from ''Mí na Samhna'' (Irish), ''Mì na Samhna'' (Scottish Gaelic) and ''Mee Houney'' (Manx), meaning "month of Samhain". The night of 31 October—Halloween—is ''Oíche Shamhna'' (Irish), ''Oidhche Shamhna'' (Scottish Gaelic) and ''Oie Houney'' (Manx), meaning "Samhain night". The day of 1 November, or the whole festival, may be called ''Lá Samhna'' (Irish), ''Là Samhna'' (Scottish Gaelic) and ''Laa Houney'' (Manx), meaning "Samhain day".

These names all come from the [[Old Irish]] ''Samain'' or ''Samuin'' {{IPA-sga|ˈsaṽɨnʲ|}}, the name for the festival held on 1 November in medieval Ireland. This comes from [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] ''*semo-'' ("summer").&lt;ref&gt;Pokorny, Julius. ''[[IEW]]'' (1959), s.v. "sem-3", p.&amp;nbsp;905.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rogers, Nicholas (2002). "Samhain and the Celtic Origins of Halloween". ''Halloween: From Pagan Ritual to Party Night'', pp. 11–21. New York: [[Oxford University Press]]. {{ISBN|0-19-516896-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; One suggestion is that the name means "summer's end", from ''sam'' ("summer") and ''fuin'' ("end"), but this may be a [[folk etymology]]. In 1907, [[Whitley Stokes]] suggested an etymology from Proto-Celtic ''*samani'' ("assembly"),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Stokes | first1 =  | year = 1907 | title = Irish etyma | journal = [[Historische Sprachforschung|Zeitschrift für vergleichende Sprachforschung]] | volume = 40 | issue = | page = 245 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Joseph Vendryes]] suggested that it is unrelated to ''*semo-'' ("summer"), because the Celtic summer ended in August.&lt;ref&gt;Vendryes, ''Lexique Étymologique de l'Irlandais Ancien'' (1959). {{Page needed|date=September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Coligny-closeup.jpg|thumb|''Samonios'' on the [[Coligny calendar]]]]

===Coligny calendar===
{{Further|Celtic calendar}}
The [[Gaulish language|Gaulish]] month name &lt;small&gt;''SAMON[IOS]''&lt;/small&gt; "(pertaining to) Summer" on the [[Coligny calendar]] is likely related to the word ''Samhain''.&lt;ref&gt;Stüber, Karin, The historical morphology of n-stems in Celtic, National University of Ireland, Maynooth, 1998, p. 111.&lt;/ref&gt; A festival of some kind may have been held during the 'three nights of ''Samonios''' (Gaulish ''trinux[tion] samo[nii]''). The Gaulish calendar seems to have split the year into two-halves: the first beginning with the month &lt;small&gt;''SAMON[IOS]''&lt;/small&gt; and the second beginning with the month &lt;small&gt;''GIAMONIOS''&lt;/small&gt;, which is related to the word for winter, PIE ''*g'hei-men-'' (Latin ''hiems'', Latvian ''ziema'', Lithuanian ''žiema'', Slavic ''zima'', Greek ''kheimon'', Hittite ''gimmanza''), cf. Old Irish ''gem-adaig'' ('winter's night'). ''Samonios'' may represent the beginning of the summer season and ''Giamonios'' (the seventh month) the beginning of the winter season. The [[lunation]]s marking the middle of each half-year may also have been marked by festivals.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}

==History==
''Samain'' or ''Samuin'' was the name of the ''feis'' or festival marking the beginning of winter in [[Gaelic Ireland]]. It is attested in some of the earliest [[Old Irish literature]], from the 10th century onward. It was one of four Gaelic seasonal festivals: Samhain (~1 November), [[Imbolc]] (~1 February), [[Bealtaine]] (~1 May) and [[Lughnasadh]] (~1 August). Samhain and Bealtaine, at the witherward side of the year from each other, are thought to have been the most important. [[James George Frazer|Sir James George Frazer]] wrote in ''[[The Golden Bough|The Golden Bough: A Study in Magic and Religion]]'' that 1 May and 1 November are of little importance to European crop-growers, but of great importance to herdsmen. It is at the beginning of summer that cattle are driven to the upland summer pastures and the beginning of winter that they are led back. Thus, Frazer suggests that halving the year at 1 May and 1 November dates from a time when the Celts were mainly a pastoral people, dependent on their herds.&lt;ref&gt;[[James George Frazer|Frazer, Sir James George]]. ''[[The Golden Bough]]: A Study in Magic and Religion''. Forgotten Books, 2008. p. 644&lt;/ref&gt; 

Some [[Prehistoric Ireland#Neolithic (4000–2500 BC)|Neolithic]] passage tombs in Ireland are aligned with the sunrise around the times of Samhain and Imbolc. These include the [[Mound of the Hostages]] (''Dumha na nGiall'') at the [[Hill of Tara]],&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Murphy &amp; Richard Moore. ''Island of the Setting Sun: In Search of Ireland's Ancient Astronomers''. Liffey Press, 2006. p. 81&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Loughcrew|Cairn L]] at [[Slieve na Calliagh]].&lt;ref&gt;Brennan, Martin. ''The Stones of Time: Calendars, Sundials, and Stone Chambers of Ancient Ireland''. Inner Traditions, 1994. pp. 110–11&lt;/ref&gt;

In medieval Ireland the festival marked the end of the season for trade and warfare and was a time for tribal gatherings. These gatherings are a popular setting for early Irish tales.&lt;ref name="Stations361"&gt;Hutton, Ronald (1996) ''Stations of the Sun: A History of the Ritual Year in Britain''. Oxford: Oxford University Press {{ISBN|0-19-288045-4}}, p. 361.&lt;/ref&gt;

===In Irish mythology===
[[File:Heroes of the dawn (1914) (14750481494).jpg|thumb|left|upright|The hero [[Fionn mac Cumhaill|Fionn]] fighting [[Aillen]], who is said to have burned [[Hill of Tara|Tara]] each Samhain]]

Irish mythology was originally a spoken tradition, but much of it was eventually written down in the Middle Ages by Christian [[monk]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.tn/books?id=3ZwGDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA9&amp;lpg=PA9&amp;dq=irish+mythology+was+written+down+by+christian+monks&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=SIMSZxX5f6&amp;sig=EWotXjS8GslTEUE5IwooPOKqeOQ&amp;hl=fr&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=irish%20mythology%20was%20written%20down%20by%20christian%20monks&amp;f=false|title=Celtic Myth: A Treasury of Legends, Art, and History|last=Harpur|first=James|date=2016-04-15|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781317475286|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.tn/books?id=aijoCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA78&amp;lpg=PA78&amp;dq=irish+mythology+was+written+down+by+christian+monks&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ndhtK42nyx&amp;sig=Q6ndKawzCTMp64Y8FGbYY7WW0YY&amp;hl=fr&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=samhain&amp;f=false|title=From Olympus to Camelot: The World of European Mythology|last=Leeming|first=David|date=2003-05-08|publisher=OUP US|isbn=9780195143614|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; who Christianized it to some extent. Nevertheless, these tales may shed some light on what Samhain meant and how it was marked in ancient Ireland.

Irish mythology tells us that Samhain was one of the four seasonal festivals of the year, and the 10th-century tale ''[[Tochmarc Emire]]'' ('The Wooing of Emer') lists Samhain as the first of these four "[[quarter days]]".&lt;ref name="Stations361"/&gt; The tales say it was marked by great gatherings where they held meetings, feasted, drank alcohol,&lt;ref name=monaghan407&gt;Monaghan, p. 407&lt;/ref&gt; and held contests.&lt;ref name="Stations361"/&gt;

According to Irish mythology, Samhain (like [[Bealtaine]]) was a time when the 'doorways' to the [[Celtic Otherworld|Otherworld]] opened, allowing supernatural beings and the souls of the dead to come into our world; but while Bealtaine was a summer festival for the living, Samhain "was essentially a festival for the dead".&lt;ref&gt;Monaghan, Patricia. ''The Encyclopedia of Celtic Mythology and Folklore.'' Infobase Publishing, 2004. p. 41&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Boyhood Deeds of Fionn]]'' says that the ''[[Aos Sí|sídhe]]'' (fairy mounds or portals to the Otherworld) "were always open at Samhain".&lt;ref&gt;Koch, John T. ''Celtic Culture: A Historical Encyclopedia.'' 2006. p. 388&lt;/ref&gt; It tells us that the [[High King of Ireland]] hosted a great gathering at [[Hill of Tara|Tara]] each Samhain. Each year the fire-breather [[Aillen]] emerges from the Otherworld and burns down the palace of Tara after lulling everyone to sleep with his music. One Samhain, the young [[Fionn mac Cumhaill]] is able to stay awake and slays Aillen with a magical spear, for which he is made leader of the [[fianna]]. In a similar tale, one Samhain the Otherworld being Cúldubh comes out of the burial mound on [[Slievenamon]] and snatches a roast pig. Fionn kills Cúldubh with a spear throw as he re-enters the mound. Fionn's thumb is caught between the door and the post as it shuts, and he puts it in his mouth to ease the pain. As his thumb had been inside the Otherworld, Fionn is bestowed with great wisdom. This may refer to gaining knowledge from the ancestors.&lt;ref&gt;Ó hÓgáin, Dáithí. ''Myth Legend and Romance: An Encyclopaedia of the Irish Folk Tradition''.

Some tales may suggest that offerings or sacrifices were made at Samhain. In the ''[[Lebor Gabála Érenn]]'' (or 'Book of Invasions'), each Samhain the people of [[Nemed]] had to give two-thirds of their children, their corn and their milk to the monstrous [[Fomorians]]. The Fomorians seem to represent the harmful or destructive powers of nature; personifications of chaos, darkness, death, blight and drought.&lt;ref name=macculloch2009&gt;MacCulloch, John Arnott.

Irish Academic Press, 1996. p. 74&lt;/ref&gt; This [[tribute]] paid by Nemed's people may represent a "sacrifice offered at the beginning of winter, when the powers of darkness and blight are in the ascendant".&lt;ref&gt;MacCulloch (2009), p. 80&lt;/ref&gt; According to the later ''[[Dindsenchas]]'' and the ''[[Annals of the Four Masters]]''—which were written by Christian monks—Samhain in ancient Ireland was associated with a god or idol called [[Crom Cruach]]. The texts claim that a first-born child would be sacrificed at the stone idol of Crom Cruach in [[Magh Slécht]]. They say that King [[Tigernmas]], and three-fourths of his people, died while worshiping Crom Cruach there one Samhain.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ucc.ie/celt/published/T100005A/text006.html ''Annals of the Four Masters: Part 6''] at Corpus of Electronic Texts.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The legendary kings [[Diarmait mac Cerbaill]] and [[Muirchertach mac Muiredaig (Mac Ercae)|Muirchertach mac Ercae]] each die a [[threefold death]] on Samhain, which involves wounding, burning and drowning, and of which they are forewarned. In the tale ''[[Togail Bruidne Dá Derga]]'' ('The Destruction of Dá Derga's Hostel'), king [[Conaire Mór]] also meets his death on Samhain after breaking his ''[[geis|geasa]]'' (prohibitions or taboos). He is warned of his impending doom by three undead horsemen who are messengers of [[Donn]], god of the dead.&lt;ref&gt;Ó hÓgáin, Dáithí.

In the ''[[Nera (mythology)|Echtra Neraí]]'' ('The Adventure of Nera'),&lt;ref&gt;Monaghan, p. 107&lt;/ref&gt; King [[Ailill mac Máta|Ailill]] of [[Connacht]] sets his [[retinue]] a test of bravery on Samhain night. He offers a prize to whoever can make it to a [[gallows]] and tie a band around a hanged man's ankle. Each challenger is thwarted by demons and runs back to the king's hall in fear. However, Nera succeeds, and the dead man then asks for a drink. Nera carries him on his back and they stop at three houses. They enter the third, where the dead man drinks and spits it on the householders, killing them. Returning, Nera sees a [[Wild Hunt|fairy host]] burning the king's hall and slaughtering those inside. He follows the host through a portal into the Otherworld. Nera learns that what he saw was only a vision of what will happen the next Samhain unless something is done. He is able to return to the hall and warns the king.

The tale ''Aided Chrimthainn maic Fidaig'' ('The Killing of Crimthann mac Fidaig') tells how [[Mongfind]] kills her brother, king [[Crimthann mac Fidaig|Crimthann]] of Munster, so that one of her sons might become king. Mongfind offers Crimthann a poisoned drink at a feast, but he asks her to drink from it first. Having no other choice but to drink the poison, she dies on Samhain eve. The [[Middle Irish]] writer notes that Samhain is also called ''Féile Moingfhinne'' (the Festival of Mongfind or Mongfhionn), and that "women and the rabble make petitions to her" at Samhain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Stokes | first1 = Whitley | year = 1903 | title = Revue Celtique| url = https://archive.org/details/revueceltiqu24pari | journal = Revue Celtique | volume = 24 | issue = | page = 179 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Byrne, Francis John.

Many other events in Irish mythology happen or begin on Samhain. The invasion of [[Ulster]] that makes up the main action of the ''[[Táin Bó Cúailnge]]'' ('Cattle Raid of Cooley') begins on Samhain. As cattle-raiding typically was a summer activity, the invasion during this off-season surprised the Ulstermen.&lt;ref&gt;Monaghan, p. 438&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Cath Maige Tuired|Second Battle of Magh Tuireadh]]'' also begins on Samhain.&lt;ref&gt;Monaghan, p. 345&lt;/ref&gt; [[The Morrígan]] and [[The Dagda]] meet and have sex before the battle against the Fomorians; in this way the Morrígan acts as a [[sovereignty]] figure and gives the victory to the Dagda's people, the [[Tuatha Dé Danann]]. In ''Aislinge Óengusa'' ('The Dream of Óengus') it is when he and his bride-to-be switch from bird to human form, and in ''[[Tochmarc Étaíne]]'' ('The Wooing of Étaín') it is the day on which Óengus claims the kingship of [[Brú na Bóinne]].&lt;ref name=koch690/&gt;

[[File:Owenagcat.jpg|thumb|[[Rathcroghan#Oweynagat|Oweynagat]] ('cave of the cats'), one of the many 'gateways to the Otherworld' whence beings and spirits were said to have emerged on Samhain.]]

Several sites in Ireland are especially linked to Samhain. Each Samhain a host of otherworldly beings was said to emerge from [[Rathcroghan#Oweynagat|Oweynagat]] ("cave of the cats"), at [[Rathcroghan]] in [[County Roscommon]].&lt;ref&gt;O'Halpin, Andy. ''Ireland: An Oxford Archaeological Guide.'' Oxford University Press, 2006. p. 236&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Hill of Ward]] (or Tlachtga) in [[County Meath]] is thought to have been the site of a great Samhain gathering and bonfire;&lt;ref name=monaghan407/&gt; the [[Iron Age]] [[ringfort]] is said to have been where the goddess or druid [[Tlachtga]] gave birth to triplets and where she later died.

In ''The Stations of the Sun: A History of the Ritual Year in Britain'' (1996), [[Ronald Hutton]] writes: "No doubt there were [pagan] religious observances as well, but none of the tales ever portrays any". The only historic reference to pagan religious rites is in the work of [[Geoffrey Keating]] (died 1644), but his source is unknown. Hutton says it may be that no religious rites are mentioned because, centuries after Christianization, the writers had no record of them.&lt;ref name="Stations361"/&gt; Hutton suggests Samhain may not have been ''particularly'' associated with the supernatural. He says that the gatherings of royalty and warriors on Samhain may simply have been an ideal setting for such tales, in the same way that many [[List of books about King Arthur|Arthurian]] tales are set at courtly gatherings at Christmas or Pentecost.&lt;ref name="Stations362"&gt;Hutton, Ronald (1996) ''Stations of the Sun: A History of the Ritual Year in Britain.'' Oxford, Oxford University Press {{ISBN|0-19-288045-4}}, p. 362.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Historic customs===
Samhain was one of the four main festivals of the Gaelic calendar, marking the end of the [[harvest]] and beginning of winter.&lt;ref name=monaghan407/&gt; Samhain customs are mentioned in several medieval texts. In ''[[Serglige Con Culainn]]'' ('Cúchulainn's Sickbed'), it is said that the festival of the [[Ulaid]] at Samhain lasted a week: Samhain itself, and the three days before and after. It involved great gatherings at which they held meetings, feasted, drank alcohol, and held contests.&lt;ref name="Stations361"/&gt; The ''Togail Bruidne Dá Derga'' notes that bonfires were lit at Samhain and stones cast into the fires.&lt;ref name="da derga"&gt;[http://www.sacred-texts.com/neu/dddh/dddh.htm The Destruction of Dá Derga's Hostel – Translated by Whitley Stokes].&lt;/ref&gt; It is mentioned in [[Geoffrey Keating]]'s ''[[Foras Feasa ar Éirinn]]'', which was written in the early 1600s but draws on earlier medieval sources, some of which are unknown. He claims that the ''[[feis]]'' of Tara was held for a week every third Samhain, when the nobles and [[ollam]]s of Ireland met to lay down and renew [[Early Irish law|the laws]], and to feast.&lt;ref&gt;[[Geoffrey Keating|Keating, Geoffrey]]. ''[[Foras Feasa ar Éirinn]]'', [https://celt.ucc.ie/published/T100054/text036.html Section 26]. [[Corpus of Electronic Texts]].&lt;/ref&gt; He also claims that the [[druid]]s lit a sacred bonfire at Tlachtga and made sacrifices to the gods, sometimes by burning them in the fire. He adds that all other fires were doused and then re-lit from this bonfire.&lt;ref&gt;[[Geoffrey Keating|Keating, Geoffrey]]. ''[[Foras Feasa ar Éirinn]]'', [https://celt.ucc.ie/published/T100054/text049.html Section 39]. [[Corpus of Electronic Texts]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditionally, Samhain was a time to take stock of the herds and food supplies. Cattle were brought down to the winter pastures after six months in the higher summer pastures.&lt;ref name=monaghan407/&gt; It was also the time to choose which animals would need to be slaughtered for the winter. This custom is still observed by many who farm and raise livestock&lt;ref name="O'Driscoll"/&gt;&lt;ref name="McNeill"&gt;McNeill, F. Marian (1961, 1990) ''The Silver Bough'', Vol. 3. William MacLellan, Glasgow {{ISBN|0-948474-04-1}} pp. 11–46&lt;/ref&gt; because it is when meat will keep since the freeze has come and also since summer grass is gone and free foraging is no longer possible. It is thought that some of the rituals associated with the slaughter have been transferred to other winter holidays. On [[St. Martin's Day]] (11 November) in Ireland, an animal—usually a [[rooster]], [[Domestic goose|goose]] or sheep—would be slaughtered and some of its blood sprinkled on the [[Threshold (door)|threshold]] of the house. It was offered to [[Martin of Tours|Saint Martin]], who may have taken the place of a god or gods,&lt;ref name=macculloch&gt;MacCulloch, John Arnott (1911). ''The Religion of the Ancient Celts''. [http://www.sacred-texts.com/neu/celt/rac/rac21.htm Chapter 18: Festivals].&lt;/ref&gt; and it was then eaten as part of a feast. This custom was common in parts of Ireland until the 19th century,&lt;ref&gt;Hutton, ''The Stations of the Sun'', p. 386&lt;/ref&gt; and was found in some other parts of Europe. At New Year in the [[Hebrides]], a man dressed in a cowhide would circle the township [[sunwise]]. A bit of the hide would be burnt and everyone would breathe in the smoke.&lt;ref name=macculloch/&gt; These customs were meant to keep away bad luck, and similar customs were found in other Celtic regions.&lt;ref name=macculloch/&gt;

[[File:Beltane Bonfire on Calton Hill.JPG|thumb|left|[[Bonfire]]s were a big part of the festival in many areas (pictured is a Beltane bonfire in Scotland)]]

As at Bealtaine, bonfires were lit on hilltops at Samhain and there were rituals involving them.&lt;ref name=monaghan407/&gt; However, by the modern era, they only seem to have been common in parts of the [[Scottish Highlands]], on the Isle of Man, in north and mid Wales, and in parts of [[Ulster]].&lt;ref name=hutton369&gt;Hutton, p. 369&lt;/ref&gt; [[F. Marian McNeill]] says that a [[force-fire]] (or [[need-fire]]) was the traditional way of lighting them, but notes that this method gradually died out.&lt;ref name="McNeill"/&gt; Likewise, only certain kinds of wood were traditionally used, but later records show that many kinds of flammable material were burnt.&lt;ref name="Campbell"&gt;[[John Gregorson Campbell|Campbell, John Gregorson]] (1900, 1902, 2005) ''The Gaelic Otherworld''. Edited by Ronald Black. Edinburgh, Birlinn Ltd. {{ISBN|1-84158-207-7}} pp. 559–62&lt;/ref&gt; It is suggested that the fires were a kind of [[sympathetic magic|imitative or sympathetic magic]]—they mimicked the Sun, helping the "powers of growth" and holding back the decay and darkness of winter.&lt;ref name="McNeill"/&gt;&lt;ref name=macculloch/&gt;&lt;ref name=frazer63&gt;Frazer, James George (1922). ''[[The Golden Bough|The Golden Bough: A Study in Magic and Religion]]''. [http://www.sacred-texts.com/pag/frazer/gb06301.htm Chapter 63, Part 1: On the Fire-festivals in general].&lt;/ref&gt; They may also have served to symbolically "burn up and destroy all harmful influences".&lt;ref name=frazer63/&gt; Accounts from the 18th and 19th centuries suggest that the fires (as well as their smoke and ashes) were deemed to have protective and cleansing powers.&lt;ref name=hutton365-368&gt;Hutton, pp. 365–68&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Moray]], boys asked for bonfire fuel from each house in the village. When the fire was lit, "one after another of the youths laid himself down on the ground as near to the fire as possible so as not to be burned, and in such a position as to let the smoke roll over him. The others ran through the smoke and jumped over him". When the bonfire burnt down, they scattered the ashes, vying with each other who should scatter them most.&lt;ref name=hutton365-368/&gt; Sometimes, two bonfires would be built side by side, and the people—sometimes with their livestock—would walk between them as a cleansing ritual. The bones of slaughtered cattle were said to have been cast upon bonfires. In the pre-Christian Gaelic world, cattle were the main form of wealth and were the center of agricultural and pastoral life.

People also took flames from the bonfire back to their homes. In parts of Scotland, torches of burning [[Scots pine|fir]] or turf were carried [[sunwise]] around homes and fields to protect them.&lt;ref name=hutton369/&gt; In some places, people doused their hearth fires on Samhain night. Each family then solemnly re-lit its hearth from the communal bonfire, thus bonding the community together.&lt;ref name="O'Driscoll"/&gt;&lt;ref name="McNeill"/&gt; The 17th century writer Geoffrey Keating claimed that this was an ancient tradition, instituted by the druids.&lt;ref name="Stations361"/&gt; Dousing the old fire and bringing in the new may have been a way of banishing evil, which was done at New Year festivals in many countries.&lt;ref name=macculloch/&gt;

[[File:Snap-Apple Night globalphilosophy.PNG|thumb|''Snap-Apple Night'' (1833), painted by [[Daniel Maclise]], shows people playing divination games on 31 October in Ireland]]

The bonfires were also used in [[divination]] rituals. In 18th century [[Ochtertyre]], a ring of stones—one for each person—was laid round the fire, perhaps on a layer of ashes. Everyone then ran round it with a torch, "exulting". In the morning, the stones were examined and if any was mislaid it was said that the person it represented would not live out the year. A similar custom was observed in north Wales&lt;ref name=hutton365-368/&gt; and in [[Brittany]].&lt;ref&gt;Frazer, p. 647&lt;/ref&gt; James Frazer says that this may come from "an older custom of actually burning them" (i.e. [[human sacrifice]]) or may have always been symbolic.&lt;ref&gt;Frazer, pp. 663–64&lt;/ref&gt; Divination has likely been a part of the festival since ancient times,&lt;ref name=monaghan407/&gt; and it has survived in some rural areas.&lt;ref&gt;Danaher (1972), pp. 218–27&lt;/ref&gt; At household festivities throughout the Gaelic regions and Wales, there were many rituals intended to divine the future of those gathered, especially with regard to death and marriage.&lt;ref name=monaghan407/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hutton, p. 380&lt;/ref&gt; Apples and hazelnuts were often used in these divination rituals or games. In [[Celtic mythology]], [[Apple (symbolism)|apples]] were strongly associated with the [[Celtic Otherworld|Otherworld]] and immortality, while [[Hazel#Mythology and folklore|hazelnuts]] were associated with divine wisdom.&lt;ref&gt;MacLeod, Sharon. ''Celtic Myth and Religion''. McFarland, 2011. pp. 61, 107&lt;/ref&gt; One of the most common games was [[apple bobbing]]. Another involved hanging a small wooden rod from the ceiling at head height, with a lit candle on one end and an apple hanging from the other. The rod was spun round and everyone took turns to try to catch the apple with their teeth.&lt;ref&gt;Danaher (1972), pp. 202–05&lt;/ref&gt; Apples were peeled in one long strip, the peel tossed over the shoulder, and its shape was said to form the first letter of the future spouse's name.&lt;ref&gt;Danaher (1972), p. 223&lt;/ref&gt; Two hazelnuts were roasted near a fire; one named for the person roasting them and the other for the person they desired. If the nuts jumped away from the heat, it was a bad sign, but if the nuts roasted quietly it foretold a good match.&lt;ref&gt;McNeill (1961), ''The Silver Bough Volume III'', pp. 33–34&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Danaher (1972), p. 219&lt;/ref&gt;  Items were hidden in food—usually a cake, [[barmbrack]], [[cranachan]], [[Champ (food)|champ]] or [[sowans]]—and portions of it served out at random. A person's future was foretold by the item they happened to find; for example a ring meant marriage and a coin meant wealth.&lt;ref&gt;McNeill (1961), ''The Silver Bough Volume III'', p. 34&lt;/ref&gt; A salty oatmeal bannock was baked; the person ate it in three bites and then went to bed in silence without anything to drink. This was said to result in a dream in which their future spouse offers them a drink to quench their thirst.&lt;ref&gt;McNeill (1961), ''The Silver Bough Volume III'', p. 34&lt;/ref&gt; Egg whites were dropped in water, and the shapes foretold the number of future children. Children would also chase crows and divine some of these things from the number of birds or the direction they flew.&lt;ref name="O'Driscoll"/&gt;&lt;ref name="McNeill"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Campbell"/&gt;

As noted earlier, Samhain was seen as a liminal time, when the boundary between this world and the [[Celtic Otherworld|Otherworld]] could more easily be crossed.&lt;ref&gt;Koch, John T. ''Celtic Culture: A Historical Encyclopedia''. 2006. p. 1557&lt;/ref&gt; This meant the ''[[aos sí]]'', the 'spirits' or 'fairies', could more easily come into our world. Many scholars see the ''aos sí'' as remnants of the pagan gods and nature spirits.&lt;ref&gt;Monaghan, p. 167&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Santino, Jack. ''The Hallowed Eve: Dimensions of Culture in a Calendar Festival of Northern Ireland''. University Press of Kentucky, 1998. p. 105&lt;/ref&gt; At Samhain, it was believed that the ''aos sí'' needed to be [[propitiation|propitiated]] to ensure that the people and their livestock survived the winter. As such, offerings of food and drink would be left outside for the ''aos sí''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Walter Evans-Wentz|Evans-Wentz, Walter]] (1911). ''The Fairy-Faith in Celtic Countries''. p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[F. Marian McNeill|McNeill, F. Marian]] (1961). ''The Silver Bough, Volume 3''. p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt; Portions of the crops might also be left in the ground for them.&lt;ref&gt;Danaher (1972), p. 200&lt;/ref&gt; One custom—described a "blatant example" of a "pagan rite surviving into the Christian epoch"—was observed in the [[Outer Hebrides]] until the early 19th century. On 31 October, the locals would go down to the shore. One man would wade into the water up to his waist, where he would pour out a cup of ale and ask '[[Seonaidh]]' ('Shoney'), whom he called "god of the sea", to bestow blessings on them.&lt;ref name=hutton369/&gt; People also took special care not to offend the ''aos sí'' and sought to ward-off any who were out to cause mischief. They stayed near to home or, if forced to walk in the darkness, turned their clothing inside-out or carried iron or salt to keep them at bay.&lt;ref name=monaghan407/&gt; The dead were also honored at Samhain. The beginning of winter may have been seen as the most fitting time to do so, as it was a time of 'dying' in nature.&lt;ref name=macculloch10&gt;MacCulloch, John Arnott (1911). ''The Religion of the Ancient Celts''. [http://sacred-texts.com/neu/celt/rac/rac13.htm Chapter 10: The Cult of the Dead].&lt;/ref&gt; The souls of the dead were thought to revisit their homes seeking hospitality. Places were set at the dinner table and by the fire to welcome them.&lt;ref name="O'Driscoll"/&gt;&lt;ref name=mcneill1&gt;McNeill, ''The Silver Bough, Volume 3'', pp. 11–46&lt;/ref&gt; The belief that the souls of the dead return home on one night of the year and must be appeased seems to have ancient origins and is found in many cultures throughout the world.&lt;ref name=miles&gt;Miles, Clement A. (1912). ''Christmas in Ritual and Tradition''. [http://www.sacred-texts.com/time/crt/crt11.htm Chapter 7: All Hallow Tide to Martinmas].&lt;/ref&gt; James Frazer suggests "It was perhaps a natural thought that the approach of winter should drive the poor, shivering, hungry ghosts from the bare fields and the leafless woodlands to the shelter of the cottage".&lt;ref name=frazer62&gt;Frazer, James George (1922). ''[[The Golden Bough|The Golden Bough: A Study in Magic and Religion]]''. [http://www.sacred-texts.com/pag/frazer/gb06206.htm Chapter 62, Part 6: The Hallowe'en Fires].&lt;/ref&gt; However, the souls of thankful kin could return to bestow blessings just as easily as that of a wronged person could return to wreak revenge.&lt;ref&gt;Monaghan, p. 120&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Mari Lwyd (wiki).jpg|thumb|left|A [[Mari Lwyd]], the Welsh equivalent of the Láir Bhán]]

[[Mummers Play|Mumming]] and [[guising]] was a part of Samhain from at least the 16th century and was recorded in parts of Ireland, Scotland, Mann and Wales.&lt;ref name=hutton380-382&gt;Hutton, pp. 380–82&lt;/ref&gt; It involved people going from house to house in costume (or in disguise), usually reciting songs or verses in exchange for food.&lt;ref name=hutton380-382/&gt; It is suggested that it evolved from a tradition whereby people impersonated the ''aos sí'', or the souls of the dead, and received offerings on their behalf.&lt;ref name=hutton380-382/&gt; Impersonating these spirits or souls was also believed to protect oneself from them.&lt;ref&gt;Hole, Christina. ''British Folk Customs''. Hutchinson, 1976. p. 91&lt;/ref&gt; S. V. Peddle suggests the guisers "personify the old spirits of the winter, who demanded reward in exchange for good fortune".&lt;ref&gt;Peddle, S.V. (2007). ''Pagan Channel Islands: Europe's Hidden Heritage''. p. 54&lt;/ref&gt; McNeill suggests that the ancient festival included people in masks or costumes representing these spirits and that the modern custom came from this.&lt;ref name=mcneill2&gt;McNeill, F. Marian. ''Hallowe'en: its origin, rites and ceremonies in the Scottish tradition''. Albyn Press, 1970. pp. 29–31&lt;/ref&gt; In Ireland, costumes were sometimes worn by those who went about before nightfall collecting for a Samhain feast.&lt;ref name=hutton380-382/&gt;

In parts of southern Ireland during the 19th century, the guisers included a [[hobby horse]] known as the ''Láir Bhán'' (white [[mare]]). A man covered in a white sheet and carrying a decorated horse skull (representing the ''Láir Bhán'') would lead a group of youths, blowing on cow horns, from farm to farm. At each they recited verses, some of which "savoured strongly of paganism", and the farmer was expected to donate food. If the farmer donated food he could expect good fortune from the 'Muck Olla'; not doing so would bring misfortune.&lt;ref&gt;''Journal of the Royal Society of Antiquaries of Ireland, Volume 2''. 1855. pp. 308–09&lt;/ref&gt; This is akin to the ''[[Mari Lwyd]]'' (grey mare) procession in Wales, which takes place at [[Midwinter]].

However, in the Celtic-speaking regions they were "particularly appropriate to a night upon which supernatural beings were said to be abroad and could be imitated or warded off by human wanderers".&lt;ref name=hutton380-382/&gt;

Hutton writes: "When imitating malignant spirits it was a very short step from guising to playing pranks". Playing pranks at Samhain is recorded in the Scottish Highlands as far back as 1736 and was also common in Ireland, which led to Samhain being nicknamed "Mischief Night" in some parts.&lt;ref name=hutton380-382/&gt; Wearing costumes at Halloween spread to England in the 20th century, as did the custom of playing pranks, though there had been mumming at other festivals.&lt;ref name=hutton380-382/&gt; At the time of mass transatlantic Irish and Scottish immigration, which popularised Halloween in North America, Halloween in Ireland and Scotland had a strong tradition of guising and pranks.&lt;ref&gt;Rogers, Nicholas. (2002) "Festive Rights:Halloween in the British Isles". Halloween: From Pagan Ritual to Party Night. pp. 43, 48. Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Trick-or-treating]] may have come from the custom of going door-to-door collecting food for Samhain feasts, fuel for Samhain bonfires and/or offerings for the ''aos sí''. Alternatively, it may have come from the All Saints/All Souls custom of collecting [[soul cake]]s.

The "traditional illumination for guisers or pranksters abroad on the night in some places was provided by [[turnip]]s or [[mangelwurzel|mangel wurzels]], hollowed out to act as lanterns and often carved with grotesque faces".&lt;ref name=hutton380-382/&gt; They were also set on windowsills.

===Celtic Revival===
During the late 19th and early 20th century [[Celtic Revival]], there was an upswell of interest in Samhain and the other Celtic festivals. Sir [[John Rhys]] put forth that it had been the "Celtic New Year". He inferred it from contemporary folklore in Ireland and Wales, which he felt was "full of Hallowe'en customs associated with new beginnings". He visited Mann and found that the Manx sometimes called 31 October "New Year's Night" or ''Hog-unnaa''. The ''[[Tochmarc Emire]]'', written in the Middle Ages, reckoned the year around the four festivals at the beginning of the seasons, and put Samhain at the beginning of those. However, Hutton says that the evidence for it being the Celtic or Gaelic New Year's Day is flimsy.&lt;ref name=hutton363&gt;Hutton, p. 363&lt;/ref&gt; Rhys's theory was popularised by Sir [[James George Frazer]], though at times he did acknowledge that the evidence is inconclusive. Frazer also put forth that Samhain had been the pagan Celtic festival of the dead and that it had been Christianized as All Saints and All Souls.&lt;ref name=hutton363/&gt; Since then, Samhain has been popularly seen as the Celtic New Year and an ancient festival of the dead. The calendar of the [[Celtic League (political organisation)|Celtic League]], for example, begins and ends at Samhain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.celticleague.org/calendar.html |title=The Celtic League Calendar |publisher=Celticleague.org |accessdate=5 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Brythonic languages|Brythonic branch]] of the Celtic languages, Samhain is known as the 'calends of winter'. The Brythonic lands of Wales, Cornwall and [[Brittany]] held festivals on 31 October similar to the Gaelic one. In Wales it is ''[[Calan Gaeaf]]'', in Cornwall it is [[Allantide]] or ''Kalan Gwav'' and in Brittany it is ''Kalan Goañv''.&lt;ref name=koch690/&gt;

The [[Isle of Man|Manx]] celebrate [[Hop-tu-Naa]] on 31 October, which is a celebration of the original New Year's Eve. The term is Manx Gaelic in origin, possibly from ''Shogh ta'n Oie'', meaning "this is the night". Traditionally, children carve turnips rather than pumpkins and carry them around the neighborhood singing traditional songs relating to hop-tu-naa.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}

===Allhallowtide===
The Roman Catholic holy day of [[All Saints' Day|All Saints]] (or All Hallows) was introduced in the year 609, but was originally celebrated on 13 May.&lt;ref name=hutton364&gt;Hutton, p. 364&lt;/ref&gt; In 835, [[Louis the Pious]] switched it to 1 November in the [[Carolingian Empire]], at the behest of [[Pope Gregory IV]].&lt;ref name=hutton364/&gt; However, from the testimony of [[Pseudo-Bede]], it is known that churches in what are now England and Germany were already celebrating All Saints on 1 November at the beginning of the 8th century.&lt;ref name=hutton364/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pseudo-Bede, ''Homiliae subdititiae''; John Hennig, 'The Meaning of All the Saints', ''Mediaeval Studies'' 10 (1948), 147–61.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"All Saints Day," ''The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church'', 3rd edition, ed. E. A. Livingstone (Oxford: [[Oxford University Press]], 1997), 41–42; ''The New Catholic Encyclopedia'', ''eo.loc''.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, Louis merely made official the custom of celebrating it on 1 November. James Frazer suggests that 1 November was chosen because it was the date of the Celtic festival of the dead (Samhain)—the Celts had influenced their English neighbours, and English missionaries had influenced the Germans. However, Ronald Hutton points out that, according to [[Óengus of Tallaght]] (d. ca. 824), the 7th/8th century church in Ireland celebrated All Saints on 20 April. He suggests that the 1 November date was a Germanic rather than a Celtic idea.&lt;ref name=hutton364/&gt; In the 11th century, 2 November became established as [[All Souls' Day]]. This created the [[Triduum|three-day observance]] known as [[Allhallowtide]]: All Hallows' Eve (31 October), All Hallows' Day (1 November), and All Souls' Day (2 November).

It is widely believed that many of the modern secular customs of All Hallows' Eve (or [[Halloween]]) were influenced by the festival of Samhain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BBC – Religions – Christianity: All Hallows' Eve|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/christianity/holydays/halloween_1.shtml|publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC)|quote=It is widely believed that many Hallowe'en traditions have evolved from an ancient Celtic festival called Samhain which was Christianised by the early Church|year=2010|accessdate=1 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Merriam-Webster's Encyclopædia of World Religions |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZP_f9icf2roC&amp;pg=PA408|publisher=Merriam-Webster|quote=Halloween, ''also called'' All Hallows' Eve, holy or hallowed evening observed on October 31, the eve of All Saints' Day.

==Neopaganism==
{{See also|Wheel of the Year}}

Samhain and Samhain-based festivals are held by some [[Neopaganism|Neopagans]]. As there are many kinds of Neopaganism, their Samhain celebrations can be very different despite the shared name. Some try to emulate the historic festival as much as possible. Other Neopagans base their celebrations on sundry unrelated sources, Gaelic culture being only one of the sources.&lt;ref name="Hutton"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Adler1"&gt;Adler, Margot (1979, revised edition 2006) ''Drawing Down the Moon: Witches, Druids, Goddess-Worshippers, and Other Pagans in America Today''. Boston: Beacon Press {{ISBN|0-8070-3237-9}}. pp. 3, 243–99&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="McColman"&gt;McColman, Carl (2003) ''Complete Idiot's Guide to Celtic Wisdom''. Alpha Press {{ISBN|0-02-864417-4}}. pp. 12, 51&lt;/ref&gt; Folklorist Jenny Butler&lt;ref&gt;Butler, Jenny (2009), "Neo-Pagan Celebrations of Samhain" 67–82 in Foley, M. and O'Donnell, H., ed. ''Treat or Trick? Halloween in a Globalising World'', Cambridge: Cambridge Scholars Publishing. {{ISBN|1-4438-0153-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; describes how Irish pagans pick some elements of historic Samhain celebrations and meld them with references to the Celtic past, making a new festival of Samhain that is inimitably part of neo-pagan culture.

Neopagans usually celebrate Samhain on 31 October – 1 November in the Northern Hemisphere and 30 April – 1 May in the Southern Hemisphere, beginning and ending at sundown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Nevill Drury|editor1-first=Murphy|editor1-last=Pizza|editor2-first=James R|editor2-last=Lewis|title=Handbook of Contemporary Paganism |year=2009|chapter=The Modern Magical Revival: Esbats and Sabbats|url=https://books.google.com/?id=rwzttsI9-NwC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q=nevill%20drury&amp;f=false |pages=63–67 |location=[[Leiden]], Netherlands|publisher=[[Brill Publishers]]|isbn=978-9004163737}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Witchcraft and Paganism in Australia |last=Hume |first=Lynne |year=1997 |publisher=Melbourne University Press |location=Melbourne |isbn=978-0522847826}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Vos|first=Donna|title=Dancing Under an African Moon: Paganism and Wicca in South Africa |year=2002|pages=79–86|publisher=Zebra Press|location=Cape Town|isbn=9781868726530}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bodsworth|first=Roxanne T|title=Sunwyse: Celebrating the Sacred Wheel of the Year in Australia |year=2003|publisher=Hihorse Publishing|location=Victoria, Australia|isbn=978-0909223038}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some Neopagans celebrate it at the astronomical midpoint between the autumn [[equinox]] and [[winter solstice]] (or the full moon nearest this point). In the Northern Hemisphere, this midpoint is when the ecliptic longitude of the Sun reaches 225 degrees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.archaeoastronomy.com/seasons.html |title=Equinoxes, Solstice, Cross Quarters shown as seasonal cusps, worshipped by pagans and later religious holidays |publisher=Archaeoastronomy.com |accessdate=5 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, this is on 7 November, at 17:44 GMT.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.archaeoastronomy.com/2015.html |title=Chart of 2015 equinox, solstice and cross quarter dates and times, worldwide from |publisher=archaeoastronomy.com |accessdate=27 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Celtic Reconstructionism===
Like other [[Polytheistic reconstructionism|Reconstructionist]] traditions, [[Celtic Reconstructionist Paganism|Celtic Reconstructionist Pagans]] emphasize historical accuracy. They base their celebrations and rituals on traditional lore as well as research into the beliefs of the [[Celtic polytheism|polytheistic]] Celts.&lt;ref name="McColman"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bonewits"&gt;Bonewits, Isaac (2006) ''Bonewits's Essential Guide to Druidism''. New York: Kensington Publishing Group {{ISBN|0-8065-2710-2}}. pp. 128–40, 179, 183–84&lt;/ref&gt;

Celtic Reconstructionist Pagans (or CRs) often celebrate Samhain on the date of first frost, or when the last of the harvest is in and the ground is dry enough to have a bonfire.&lt;ref name="FAQSamhain"&gt;Kathryn NicDhana et al. ''The CR FAQ: An Introduction to Celtic Reconstructionist Paganism''. 2007. pp. 97–98&lt;/ref&gt; Some follow the old tradition of building two bonfires, which celebrants and livestock then walk or dance between as a ritual of purification.&lt;ref name="O'Driscoll"/&gt;&lt;ref name="McNeill"/&gt; For CRs, it is a time when the dead are especially honoured. Though CRs make offerings at all times of the year, Samhain is a time when more elaborate offerings are made to specific ancestors.&lt;ref name="FAQSamhain"/&gt; This may involve making a small shrine. Often there will be a meal, where a place for the dead is set at the table and they are invited to join. Traditional tales may be told and traditional songs, poems and dances performed. A western-facing door or window may be opened and a candle left burning on the windowsill to guide the dead home. Divination for the coming year is often done, whether in all solemnity or as games for the children. The more mystically inclined may also see this as a time for deeply communing with their deities, especially those seen as being particularly linked with this festival.&lt;ref name="O'Driscoll"/&gt;&lt;ref name="McNeill"/&gt;&lt;ref name="McColman"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bonewits"/&gt;&lt;ref name="FAQSamhain"/&gt;

===Wicca===
[[Wicca]]ns celebrate a variation of Samhain as one of the yearly [[Sabbat]]s of the [[Wheel of the Year]]. It is deemed by most Wiccans to be the most important of the four "greater Sabbats". Samhain is seen by some Wiccans as a time to celebrate the lives of those who have died, and it often involves paying respect to ancestors, family members, elders of the faith, friends, pets and other loved ones who have died.  In some rituals the spirits of the dead are invited to attend the festivities.  It is seen as a festival of darkness, which is balanced at the opposite point of the wheel by the spring festival of [[Beltane]], which Wiccans celebrate as a festival of light and fertility.&lt;ref name="SpiralDance"&gt;Starhawk (1979, 1989) ''The Spiral Dance: A Rebirth of the Ancient Religion of the Great Goddess''. New York: Harper and Row {{ISBN|0-06-250814-8}} pp. 193–96 (revised edition)&lt;/ref&gt;

Wiccans believe that at Samhain the veil between this world and the afterlife is at its thinnest point of the whole year, making it easier to communicate with those who have left this world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Nevill Drury|editor1-first=Murphy|editor1-last=Pizza|editor2-first=James R|editor2-last=Lewis|title=Handbook of Contemporary Paganism |year=2009|chapter=The Modern Magical Revival|url=https://books.google.com/?id=rwzttsI9-NwC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q=nevill%20drury&amp;f=false |page=65 |location=Leiden|publisher=Brill|isbn=978-9004163737}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4561">[[File:Olofsborg från sjösidan.JPG|thumb|420px|St. Olaf's Castle, the venue for the Opera Festival in Savonlinna.]] 
'''Savonlinna Opera Festival''' ({{lang-fi|Savonlinnan oopperajuhlat}}) is held annually in the city of [[Savonlinna]] in [[Finland]]. The Festival takes place at the medieval [[Olavinlinna]] (St. Olaf's Castle), built in 1475. The [[castle]] is located amid spectacular lake scenery.

== Origin ==
The birth of the Savonlinna Opera Festival ties in closely with the emerging [[Finland|Finnish]] identity and striving for independence at the beginning of the 20th century. Attending a nationalist meeting in [[Olavinlinna]] Castle in 1907, the Finnish soprano [[Aino Ackté]], already famous at opera houses the world over and an ardent patriot, immediately spotted the potential of the [[castle]] as the venue for an [[opera]] festival.

The first opera festival was held in 1912.&lt;ref name="Symington2009"&gt;{{cite book

|isbn=978-1-74104-771-4
|page=136}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Aino Ackté]] directed the festival for five summers, staging four [[Finland|Finnish]] [[opera]]s. The only [[opera]] by a non-Finnish composer was [[Charles Gounod]]’s ''[[Faust (opera)|Faust]]'', with Ackté herself in the leading female role of Marguerite.

In 1917 the festival ran into difficulties because of [[First World War]], [[History of Finland|Finnish Declaration of Independence]] and the ensuing [[Finnish Civil War]].

For fifty years, the [[opera]] festival was dormant, but in 1967,  Savonlinna Music Days decided to organise an opera course for young singers. The high point of the course was a performance of [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]]'s ''[[Fidelio]]'' in the castle. Therefore, 1967 is nowadays regarded as the start of the present Festival; since then it has had steady growth of both audience and reputation.

== Present-day festival ==
[[File:Scenen på borggården, Olofsborg.JPG|thumb|275px|The stage at the courtyard of St. Olaf's Castle.]]
The Savonlinna Opera Festival has grown into an internationally recognised festival lasting a month. Each year it performs to a total audience of around 60,000, an estimated quarter of whom come from abroad. Each year the Festival has, in addition to staging leading works from classical operatic repertoire, staged its own productions.

=== Premieres ===
Six operas have been premiered at the Savonlinna Opera Festival since 1967: ''[[The Horseman (opera)|The Horseman]]'' (1975), ''[[The King Goes Forth to France]]'' (1984, commissioned jointly by [[Royal Opera House|Covent Garden]] and the BBC), and ''[[Palatsi (opera)|The Palace]]'' (1995) by [[Aulis Sallinen]], ''[[The Knife (opera)|The Knife]]'' (1989) by [[Paavo Heininen]], ''[[Aleksis Kivi (opera)|Aleksis Kivi]]'' (1997) by [[Einojuhani Rautavaara]] and ''[[The Age of Dreams]]'' (2000–2001) by Herman Rechberger [http://sonopt.pp.fi], [[Olli Kortekangas]] and [[Kalevi Aho]].

=== Visits by foreign opera companies ===
For over a decade, the Savonlinna Opera Festival has hosted foreign opera companies: The first of these was the [[Estonia Theatre]] from [[Tallinn]]. This was followed for the next three seasons by the world-famous [[Mariinsky Theatre|Mariinsky (Kirov) Theatre]] from [[St. Petersburg]], by [[Royal Opera House|Covent Garden]] from [[London]] in 1998, the [[Opéra national du Rhin]] from [[Strasbourg]] in 1999, the [[New Israeli Opera]] in 2000, [[Los Angeles Opera]] in 2001, the [[Deutsche Oper am Rhein]] in 2002, and the Choir and Orchestra of the [[Municipal Theatre of Santiago]] in 2003, with a staging of [[Sergio Ortega]]'s ''Fulgor y Muerte de Joaquín Murieta'', after a libretto by [[Nobel Prize]] winner [[Pablo Neruda]].

The '''Somali Civil War''' ({{lang-so|Dagaalkii Sokeeye ee Soomaaliya}}, {{lang-ar|الحرب الأهلية الصومالية}}) is an ongoing [[civil war]] taking place in [[Somalia]]. It grew out of resistance to the [[Military dictatorship|military junta]] led by [[Siad Barre]] during the 1980s. By 1988–90, the [[Somali Armed Forces]] began engaging various armed rebel groups,&lt;ref name="Lssisea"&gt;Ken Menkhaus, '[http://ipss-addis.moodle-kurse.de/file.php/2/Reading_Materials_Module_3_Block_1_/Fragile_States_and_Insecure_People_2007.pdf#page=73 Local Security Systems in Somali East Africa],' in Andersen/Moller/Stepputat (eds.) , Fragile States and Insecure People,' Palgrave, 2007, 73. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222200912/http://ipss-addis.moodle-kurse.de/file.php/2/Reading_Materials_Module_3_Block_1_/Fragile_States_and_Insecure_People_2007.pdf#page=73 |date=February 22, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; including the [[Somali Salvation Democratic Front]] in the northeast,&lt;ref name="Legum"&gt;{{cite book|last=Legum|first=Colin|title=Africa Contemporary Record: Annual Survey and Documents, Volume 20|year=1989|publisher=Africa Research Limited|page=B-394|url=https://www.google.com/books?id=2MfiAAAAMAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Somali National Movement]] in the northwest,&lt;ref name="Lssisea"/&gt; and the [[United Somali Congress]] in the south.&lt;ref name="Tcwisigad"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bongartz|first=Maria|title=The civil war in Somalia: its genesis and dynamics|year=1991|publisher=Nordiska Afrikainstitutet|page=24|url=https://www.google.com/books?id=LNIVAQAAIAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; The clan-based armed opposition groups eventually managed to [[Somali Rebellion|overthrow]] the [[Somali Democratic Republic|Barre government]] in 1991.&lt;ref name="2009factbook"&gt;{{cite web|author=Central Intelligence Agency|title=Somalia|work=The World Factbook|publisher=Central Intelligence Agency|location=Langley, Virginia|year=2011|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/so.html|accessdate=October 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Various armed factions began competing for influence in the power vacuum and turmoil that followed, particularly in the south.&lt;ref name="Cwfbsomb"&gt;{{cite web|author=Central Intelligence Agency|title=Somalia - Government - Judicial branch|work=The World Factbook|publisher=Central Intelligence Agency|location=Langley, Virginia|year=2011|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/2028.html#so|accessdate=2 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1990–92 customary law temporarily collapsed due to the fighting.&lt;ref&gt;Ken Menkhaus, "Local Security Systems in Somali East Africa," ''Fragile States and Insecure People'', 2007, 73.&lt;/ref&gt; This precipitated the arrival of [[UNOSOM I]] UN military observers in July 1992, followed by larger peacekeeping forces. Factional fighting continued in the south.

==Fall of Barre government (1986–91)==

[[File:Siabar 003.jpg|thumb|170px|left|Major General [[Mohamed Siad Barre]], Chairman of the [[Supreme Revolutionary Council (Somalia)|Supreme Revolutionary Council]] and [[President of Somalia]].]]
In May 1986, Barre suffered serious injuries in an automobile accident near [[Mogadishu]], when the car that was transporting him smashed into the back of a bus during a heavy rainstorm.&lt;ref name="Woinffir"&gt;World of Information (Firm), ''Africa review'', (World of Information: 1987), p.213.&lt;/ref&gt; He was treated in a hospital in [[Saudi Arabia]] for head injuries, broken ribs and shock over a period of a month.&lt;ref name="Photw"&gt;Arthur S.

Although Barre managed to recover enough to present himself as the sole presidential candidate for [[Somali presidential election, 1986|re-election]] over a term of seven years on December 23, 1986, his poor health and advanced age led to speculation about who would succeed him in power. Possible contenders included his son-in-law General Ahmed Suleiman Abdille, who was at the time the Minister of the Interior, in addition to Samatar.&lt;ref name="Woinffir"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Photw"/&gt;
[[File:Abandoned Somali tanks.JPEG|thumb|left|Three knocked-out [[Military of Somalia|Somali National Army]] (SNA) [[M47 Patton]] medium tanks left abandoned near a warehouse following the outbreak of the civil war]]
In an effort to hold on to power, Barre's ruling [[Supreme Revolutionary Council (Somalia)|Supreme Revolutionary Council]] (SRC) became increasingly [[totalitarian]] and arbitrary. This caused opposition to his government to grow. Barre in turn tried to quell the unrest by abandoning appeals to nationalism, relying more and more on his own inner circle, and exploiting historical clan animosities. By the mid-1980s, more resistance movements supported by [[Ethiopia]]'s communist [[Derg]] administration had sprung up across the country. Barre responded by ordering punitive measures against those he perceived as locally supporting the guerrillas, especially in the northern regions. The clampdown included bombing of cities, with the northwestern administrative center of [[Hargeisa]], a [[Somali National Movement]] (SNM) stronghold, among the targeted areas in 1988.&lt;ref name="Locsg"&gt;{{cite web|title=Somalia&amp;nbsp;— Government|url=http://countrystudies.us/somalia/65.htm|publisher=Library of Congress|accessdate=February 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1990, as fighting intensified, Somalia's first President [[Aden Abdullah Osman Daar]] and about 100 other Somali politicians signed a manifesto advocating reconciliation.&lt;ref name="AAO"&gt;{{cite news|last=Bloomfield|first=Steve|title=Aden Abdulle Osman&amp;nbsp;— First President of Somalia|url=http://www.ephrem.org/dehai_news_archive/2007/may-jun07/0819.html|accessdate=December 21, 2013|newspaper=The Independent|date=June 11, 2007|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20131221151644/http://www.ephrem.org/dehai_news_archive/2007/may-jun07/0819.html|archivedate=December 21, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of the signatories were subsequently arrested.&lt;ref name="Hoabvt"&gt;{{cite book|title=Horn of Africa Bulletin, Volumes 3–4|year=1991|publisher=Life &amp; Peace Institute|page=14|url=https://www.google.com/books?id=_ewPAQAAMAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; Barre's heavy-handed tactics further strengthened the appeal of the various rebel movements, although these groups' only common goal was the overthrow of his government.&lt;ref name="Locsg"/&gt; It also played a major role in developing [[piracy in Somalia]].

==United Somali Congress topples Barre==
By mid 1990, [[United Somali Congress]] (USC) rebels had captured most towns and villages surrounding Mogadishu, which prompted some to give Barre the ironic title 'Mayor of Mogadishu.'&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December the USC entered Mogadishu. Four weeks of battle between Barre's remaining troops and the USC ensued, over the course of which the USC brought more forces into the city. By January 1991, USC rebels had managed to defeat the Red Berets, in the process toppling Barre's government.&lt;ref name="Locsg"/&gt; The remainder of the government's forces then finally collapsed. Some became irregular regional forces and clan militias.&lt;ref name="Fitzgerald19"&gt;Nina J. Fitzgerald, ''Somalia: issues, history, and bibliography'', (Nova Publishers: 2002), p.19.&lt;/ref&gt; After the USC's victory over Barre's troops, the other rebel groups declined to cooperate with it, as each instead drew primary support from their own constituencies.&lt;ref name="Locsg"/&gt; Among these other opposition movements were the [[Somali Patriotic Movement]] (SPM) and Somali Democratic Alliance (SDA), a [[Gadabuursi]] group which had been formed in the northwest to counter the Somali National Movement [[Isaaq]] militia.&lt;ref name="Ciisa-Salwe"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ciisa-Salwe|first=Cabdisalaam M.|title=The collapse of the Somali state: the impact of the colonial legacy|year=1996|publisher=HAAN Publishing|isbn=187420991X|page=104|url=https://www.google.com/books?id=GxMOAQAAMAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; For its part, the SNM initially refused to accept the legitimacy of the provisional government that the USC had established.&lt;ref name="Locsg"/&gt; However, the SNM's former leader [[Ahmed Mohamed Silanyo]] later proposed a power-sharing framework in March 1991 between the SNM and USC under a new transitional government.&lt;ref name="Apttsnm"&gt;{{cite web|last=Silanyo |first=Ahmed M. |title=A Proposal to the Somali National Movement: On a Framework for a Transitional Government in Somalia |url=http://wardheernews.com/Articles_2010/October/Ahmed_Silanyo/Proposal_to_SNM.pdf |publisher=Wardheernews |accessdate=February 15, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120511090753/http://wardheernews.com/Articles_2010/October/Ahmed_Silanyo/Proposal_to_SNM.pdf |archivedate=May 11, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of the opposition groups subsequently began competing for influence in the power vacuum that followed the ouster of Barre's government. In the south, armed factions led by USC commanders General [[Mohamed Farah Aidid]] and [[Ali Mahdi Mohamed]], in particular, clashed as each sought to exert authority over the capital.&lt;ref name="Lirs"&gt;Library Information and Research Service, ''The Middle East: Abstracts and index'', Volume 2, (Library Information and Research Service: 1999), p.327.&lt;/ref&gt; In the northwest, at the [[Burao]] conference of April–May 1991, SNM secessionists proclaimed independence for the region under the name [[Somaliland]].&lt;ref name="Interpeace613"&gt;Interpeace, '[http://www.interpeace.org/publications/somali-region/60-a-history-of-mediation-in-somalia-since-1988-english/file The search for peace: A history of mediation in Somalia since 1988],' Interpeace, May 2009, 13–14. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222044942/http://www.interpeace.org/publications/somali-region/60-a-history-of-mediation-in-somalia-since-1988-english/file |date=February 22, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They concurrently selected the SNM's leader [[Abdirahman Ahmed Ali Tuur]] as president.&lt;ref name=Clancy&gt;{{cite book|title=Battle Ready:Study in Command Commander Series|first=Tom |last=Clancy|authorlink=Tom Clancy|author2=Tony Zinni |author3=Tony Koltz  |pages=234–236|publisher=Penguin|year=2005 |isbn= 978-0-425-19892-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1992, after four months of heavy fighting for control of Mogadishu, a ceasefire was agreed between Ali Mahdi Mohamed and Mohamed Farah Aideed. Neither leader had seized control of the capital, and as a result, a 'greenline' was established between north and south that divided their areas of control.&lt;ref&gt;Mohamed Ahmed Jama, “Securing Mogadishu: Neighbourhood Watches,” in Whose Peace is it anyway?

==United Nations intervention (1992–95)==
{{Main article|UNITAF|UNOSOM II}}
[[United Nations Security Council Resolution 733|UN Security Council Resolution 733]] and [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 746|UN Security Council Resolution 746]] led to the creation of the [[United Nations Operation in Somalia I]] (UNOSOM I), to provide humanitarian relief and help restore order in Somalia after the dissolution of its central government.
[[File:Port of Mogadishu Checkpoint.jpg|thumb|right|An American soldier at the main entrance to the Port of [[Mogadishu]] points to identify a sniper's possible firing position (January 1994).]]
[[United Nations Security Council Resolution 794]] was unanimously passed on December 3, 1992, which approved a coalition of [[United Nations peacekeeping|United Nations peacekeepers]] led by the United States. Forming the [[Unified Task Force]] (UNITAF), the alliance was tasked with assuring security until humanitarian efforts aimed at stabilizing the situation were transferred to the UN. Landing in 1993, the UN peacekeeping coalition started the two-year [[United Nations Operation in Somalia II]] (UNOSOM II) primarily in the south.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ken Rutherford (scientist)|Ken Rutherford]], [https://www.amazon.com/dp/1565492609 ''Humanitarianism Under Fire: The US and UN Intervention in Somalia,'' Kumarian Press, July 2008] {{ISBN|1-56549-260-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; UNITAF's original mandate was to use "all necessary means" to guarantee the delivery of humanitarian aid in accordance to [[Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter]].&lt;ref name=THE-FINAL-CALL&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/Depts/DPKO/Missions/unosomi.htm|title=United Nations Operation In Somalia I&amp;nbsp;– (Unosom I)|publisher=United Nations |accessdate=January 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During negotiations from 1993 to 1995, Somali principals had some success in reconciliation and establishment of public authorities. Among these initiatives was the [[Mudug]] peace agreement of June 1993 between Aidid's forces and the SSDF, which established a ceasefire between the Haber Gedir and the Majeerteen clans, opened the trade routes, and formalized the withdrawal of militants from [[Galkayo]]; the UNOSOM-mediated Hirab reconciliation of January 1994 in Mogadishu between elders of the rival Abgal and Haber Gedir clans, which was backed by politicians from these constituencies and concluded with a pact to end hostilities, dismantle the green line partitioning the city, and remove road blocks; the UNOSOM-mediated Kismayo initiative of 1994 between the SNA, SPM, SSDF, and representatives of nineteen clans from the southern [[Lower Juba]] and [[Middle Juba]] regions;&lt;ref&gt;For further details on UNOSOM-sponsored local-level community-based reconciliation conferences, see Menkhaus, 'International Peacebuilding and the Dynamics of Local and National Reconciliation in Somalia,' International Peacekeeping, Vol. 3, No. 1, Spring 1996, 52.&lt;/ref&gt; the 1994 [[Bardhere]] conference between the Marehan and Rahanweyn (Digil and Mirifle), which resolved conflicts over local resources; and the short-lived Digil-Mirifle Governing Council for the southern [[Bay, Somalia|Bay]] and [[Bakool]] regions, which was established in March 1995.&lt;ref name="Interpeace613"/&gt;

Some of the militias that were then competing for power saw UNOSOM's presence as a threat to their hegemony. Consequently, gun battles took place in Mogadishu between local gunmen and peacekeepers. Among these was the [[Battle of Mogadishu (1993)|Battle of Mogadishu]] in October 1993, an unsuccessful attempt by U.S. troops to apprehend faction leader Aidid. UN soldiers eventually withdrew altogether from the country on March 3, 1995, having incurred more significant casualties.&lt;ref&gt;See also Report of the Secretary-General on Somalia, S/1995/231 (March 28, 1995).&lt;/ref&gt;

==USC/SSA (1995–2000)==
[[File:Cqaasim.jpg|thumb|right|President of the [[Transitional National Government]], [[Abdiqasim Salad Hassan]]]]
According to Interpeace, after UNOSOM's departure in March 1995, military clashes between local factions became shorter, generally less intense, and more localized. This was in part due to the large-scale UN military intervention that had helped to curb the intense fighting between the major factions, who then began to focus on consolidating gains that they had made. The local peace and reconciliation initiatives that had been undertaken in the south-central part of the country between 1993 and 1995 also generally had a positive impact.&lt;ref name="Interpeace613"/&gt;

Aidid subsequently declared himself President of Somalia on June 15, 1995.&lt;ref name=UNSGSom96-42&gt;{{cite web|title=Report of the Secretary-General on the Situation in Somalia (S/1996/42)|url=http://www.refworld.org/pdfid/3ae6aefc10.pdf|date=January 19, 1996|accessdate=February 14, 2014}}, page 2, paragraph 7.&lt;/ref&gt; However, his declaration received no recognition, as his rival Ali Mahdi Muhammad had already been elected interim President at a conference in [[Djibouti]] and recognized as such by the international community.&lt;ref&gt;[https://circle.ubc.ca/bitstream/handle/2429/5267/ubc_1994-0415.pdf?sequence=1 Djibouti Conference].&lt;/ref&gt;

Consequently, Aidid's faction continued its quest for hegemony in the south. In September 1995, militia forces loyal to him attacked and occupied the city of Baidoa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Associated Press|title=Aidid troops kill Somalis, capture city|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1310&amp;dat=19950919&amp;id=7nAVAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=E-sDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5828,4765554|accessdate=May 16, 2013|newspaper=The Register-Guard|date=September 19, 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aidid's forces remained in control of Baidoa from September 1995 to at least January 1996, while the local [[Rahanweyn Resistance Army]] militia continued to engage his forces in the town's environs.&lt;ref name="Snns"&gt;S/1996/42, 26, 27, 28, 29&lt;/ref&gt;

Fighting continued in the later half of 1995 in southern [[Kismayo]] and the [[Juba Valley]], as well as southwestern and central Somalia. However, despite these pockets of conflict, the [[Gedo]] and [[Middle Shabelle]] regions, in addition to both the northeastern and northwestern parts of the country remained relatively peaceful. A number of the regional and district administrations that had been locally established in the preceding few years continued to operate in these areas.&lt;ref name="Snns"/&gt;
[[File:Shatigd.jpg|thumb|left|[[Hasan Muhammad Nur Shatigadud]], leader of the [[Rahanweyn Resistance Army]]]]
In March 1996, Ali Mahdi was elected chairman of the United Somali Congress/Somali Salvation Alliance (USC/SSA), based in northern Mogadishu. In the southern part of city, Aidid's forces battled those of [[Osman Atto]] for control of the port of [[Merca]] as well as strategic areas in Mogadishu. Fighting in Merca eventually ended after elders intervened, but continued in Mogadishu. In August 1996, Aidid died from wounds incurred during combat in the Medina area.&lt;ref&gt;Report of the Secretary-General on the Situation in Somalia, S/1997/135, February 17, 1997, paragraphs 6,7, and 9.

In 1998, a homegrown constitutional conference was held in the northeastern town of [[Garowe]] over a period of three months. Attended by the area's political elite, traditional elders (''Issims''), members of the business community, intellectuals and other civil society representatives, the autonomous [[Puntland|Puntland State of Somalia]] was subsequently officially established so as to deliver services to the population, offer security, facilitate trade, and interact with both domestic and international partners.&lt;ref name="Speipbasb"&gt;[http://www.garoweonline.com/english/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=575:somalia-puntlands-experience-in-peace-building-and-state-building&amp;catid=55:somalia&amp;Itemid=79 Somalia: Puntland's Experience in Peace-building and State-building] {{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999, Eritrea was alleged to be supporting [[Somali National Alliance]] forces led by the late Aidid's son [[Hussein Farrah Aidid]]. Aidid jr. denied the claims, saying that the Ethiopian Prime Minister [[Meles Zenawi]] had requested that he mediate between [[Ethiopia]] and [[Eritrea]] in their separate conflict.&lt;ref name="Siiwhaffn"&gt;{{cite web|title=Somalia: IRIN interview with Hussein Aideed, 5/4/99|url=http://www.africa.upenn.edu/Hornet/irin_5499a.html|publisher=IRIN|accessdate=19 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However the [[International Institute for Strategic Studies]] separately reported that Hussein Aideed himself had acknowledged support from both Eritrea and Uganda.&lt;ref&gt;Strategic Survey 1999-2000, 264.&lt;/ref&gt; Aideed's forces occupied Baidoa in May 1999. However they were driven out by the [[Rahanweyn Resistance Army]] in June 1999, backed by an Ethiopian force of up to 3,000 using tanks and artillery. The IISS said that the attack was part of a strategy to prevent Eritrea opening up a new front. By the end of the year, the Rahanweyn Resistance Army had taken control of the southern Bay and Bakool provinces. The RRA's leader [[Hasan Muhammad Nur Shatigadud]] subsequently established the [[Southwestern Somalia|Southwestern State of Somalia]] regional administration.

In 2000, Ali Mahdi participated in another conference in Djibouti. He lost a re-election bid there to Barre's former Interior Minister [[Abdiqasim Salad Hassan]].&lt;ref name="Rulers1"&gt;{{cite web|title=August 2000 – Somalia|url=http://www.rulers.org/2000-08.html|publisher=Rulers|accessdate=October 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Somalian10ef5-1.jpg|thumb|right|[[Abdullahi Yusuf Ahmed]], one of the founders of the [[Transitional Federal Government]], established in 2004]]
In 2000, the [[Transitional National Government]] (TNG) was established.&lt;ref name="2009factbook"/&gt; The [[Transitional Federal Government]] (TFG) was formed in Nairobi in 2004. Selection of members of parliament was underway by June, over two hundred members of parliament (MPs) took the oath of office in August, and [[Abdullahi Yusuf Ahmed]] was elected president by the parliament in October 2004.&lt;ref&gt;Interpeace, 'The search for peace: A history of mediation in Somalia since 1988,' Interpeace, May 2009, 59-60&lt;/ref&gt;
However, in March 2005 the TFG split after a brawl in parliament over deployment of peacekeepers and relocation to an interim capital. The parliamentary speaker led some members to Mogadishu while the president and others remained in Nairobi. In June 2005, under pressure from Kenya, the remainder of the TFG left Nairobi for [[Jowhar]].&lt;ref&gt;Interpeace, May 2009, 60-61.&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2006, the TFG parliament met in Baidoa for the first time since March 2005. (Interpeace, 104)
	
A battle for Mogadishu followed in the first half of 2006 in which the [[ARPCT]], a coalition of U.S.-backed militia leaders, confronted the ascendant [[Islamic Courts Union]] (ICU).

The ''[[RUSI Journal]]'', Vol. 154, No. 4, August 2009, 8.

The arms embargo on Somalia was amended in February 2007 to allow states to supply weapons to the TFG's security forces, provided that they received prior approval from the UN's Somalia Sanctions Committee. After long discussions, the African Union approved the initial deployment of the [[African Union Mission to Somalia]] (AMISOM) in March 2007. It established a 'small triangle of protection' around Mogadishu's airport, seaport, and the [[Villa Somalia]], and began to adopt a low-key negotiating profile with key actors.&lt;ref&gt;Interpeace, May 2009, 61.&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2008, following repeated violations of the weapons blockade, the Security Council decided that an arms embargo could be imposed on entities involved in such breaches.&lt;ref name="Afacis"/&gt;
After a two-year consultation process, the TFG was formed in 2004 by Somali politicians in Nairobi under the auspices of the [[Intergovernmental Authority on Development]] (IGAD). The process also led to the establishment of the [[Transitional Federal Institutions]] (TFIs), and concluded in October 2004 with the election of [[Abdullahi Yusuf Ahmed]] as president.&lt;ref name="Abapd"&gt;{{cite web|title=Background and Political Developments |url=http://www.africa-union.org/root/au/auc/departments/psc/amisom/AMISOM_Background.htm |publisher=AMISOM |accessdate=February 11, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110821014130/http://www.africa-union.org/root/au/auc/departments/psc/amisom/AMISOM_Background.htm |archivedate=August 21, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The TFG thereafter became Somalia's internationally recognized government.&lt;ref name="Afacis"&gt;{{cite web|last=Wezeman|first=Pieter D.|title=Arms flows and conflict in Somalia|url=http://books.sipri.org/files/misc/SIPRIBP1010b.pdf|publisher=SIPRI|accessdate=February 10, 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130602122802/http://books.sipri.org/files/misc/SIPRIBP1010b.pdf|archivedate=June 2, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following their defeat, the Islamic Courts Union splintered into several different factions. Some of the more radical{{According to whom|date=October 2016}} elements, including Al-Shabaab, regrouped to continue their insurgency against the TFG and oppose the Ethiopian military's presence in Somalia. Throughout 2007 and 2008, Al-Shabaab scored military victories, seizing control of key towns and ports in both central and southern Somalia. At the end of 2008, the group had captured Baidoa but not Mogadishu. On May 1, 2008, the U.S. made an [[Dhusamareb airstrike|airstrike on Dhusamareb]], and followed on 3 May with [[Dobley airstrike|another airstrike]] on the border town of Dobley. According to the [[International Crisis Group]], Ethiopia's leaders were surprised by the insurgency's persistence and strength and frustrated at the TFG's chronic internal problems.&lt;ref&gt;International Crisis Group, Somalia: To Move Beyond the Failed State, Africa Report N°147&amp;nbsp;– December 23, 2008, 25.&lt;/ref&gt; By January 2009, Al-Shabaab and other militias had forced the Ethiopian troops to retreat, leaving behind an understaffed African Union peacekeeping force.&lt;ref name="Ruart"&gt;{{cite web|title=USCIRF Annual Report 2009 – The Commission's Watch List: Somalia|url=http://www.refworld.org/cgi-bin/texis/vtx/rwmain?page=publisher&amp;publisher=USCIRF&amp;type=&amp;coi=&amp;docid=4a4f272bc&amp;skip=0|publisher=USCIRF|accessdate=February 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to a lack of funding and human resources, an arms embargo that made it difficult to re-establish a national security force, and general indifference on the part of the international community,{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}} President Yusuf found himself obliged to deploy thousands of troops from Puntland to Mogadishu to sustain the battle against insurgent elements in the southern part of the country.

On December 29, 2008, Abdullahi Yusuf Ahmed announced before a united parliament in Baidoa his resignation as [[President of Somalia]]. In his speech, which was broadcast on national radio, Yusuf expressed regret at failing to end the country's seventeen-year conflict as his government had mandated to do.&lt;ref name=Resignation&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7802622.stm "Somalia's president quits office"], BBC News, December 29, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; He also blamed the international community for its failure to support the government, and said that the speaker of parliament would succeed him in office per the [[Transitional Federal Charter of the Somali Republic|charter]] of the Transitional Federal Government.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/a790e984-d590-11dd-a9cc-000077b07658.html "Somali President Yusuf resigns"], Reuters (FT.com), December 29, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Between May 31 and June 9, 2008, representatives of Somalia's federal government and the moderate [[Alliance for the Re-liberation of Somalia]] (ARS) group of Islamist rebels participated in peace talks in [[Djibouti]] brokered by the former United Nations Special Envoy to Somalia, [[Ahmedou Ould-Abdallah]]. The conference ended with a signed agreement calling for the withdrawal of Ethiopian troops in exchange for the cessation of armed confrontation. Parliament was subsequently expanded to 550 seats to accommodate ARS members, which then elected [[Sheikh Sharif Sheikh Ahmed]], the former ARS chairman, to office. President Sharif shortly afterwards appointed [[Omar Abdirashid Ali Sharmarke]], the son of slain former President [[Abdirashid Ali Sharmarke]], as the nation's new Prime Minister.&lt;ref name="2009factbook"/&gt;

With the help of AMISOM, the coalition government also began a [[War in Somalia (2009-)|counteroffensive]] in February 2009 to assume full control of the southern half of the country. To solidify its rule, the TFG formed an alliance with the [[Islamic Courts Union]], other members of the Alliance for the Re-liberation of Somalia, and [[Ahlu Sunna Waljama'a]], a moderate [[Sufism|Sufi]] militia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Kamaal says: |url=http://horseedmedia.net/2010/05/un-boss-urges-support-for-somalia-ahead-of-istanbul-summit/ |title=UN boss urges support for Somalia ahead of Istanbul summit |publisher=Horseedmedia.net |date=May 22, 2010 |accessdate=June 27, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100619183438/http://horseedmedia.net/2010/05/un-boss-urges-support-for-somalia-ahead-of-istanbul-summit/ |archivedate=June 19, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, Al-Shabaab and [[Hizbul Islam]], the two main Islamist groups in opposition, began to fight amongst themselves in mid-2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/8318798.stm |title=Islamists break Somali port truce |publisher=BBC News |date=October 21, 2009 |accessdate=June 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a truce, in March 2009, Somalia's coalition government announced that it would re-implement shari'a as the nation's official judicial system.&lt;ref name="Shariah in Somalia"&gt;[http://www.arabnews.com/?page=4&amp;section=0&amp;article=119757&amp;d=1&amp;m=3&amp;y=2009 Shariah in Somalia]&amp;nbsp;– ''[[Arab News]]''&lt;/ref&gt; However, conflict continued in the southern and central parts of the country. Within months, the coalition government had gone from holding about 70% of south-central Somalia's conflict zones, territory which it had inherited from the previous Yusuf administration, to losing control of over 80% of the disputed territory to the Islamist insurgents.&lt;ref name="Gosppsdott"&gt;{{cite web |last=Online |first=Garowe |url=http://www.garoweonline.com/english/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=558:somalia-president-parliament-speaker-dispute-over-tfg-term&amp;catid=55:somalia&amp;Itemid=79 |title=Somalia President, Parliament Speaker dispute over TFG term |publisher=Garoweonline.com |date=January 12, 2011 |accessdate=June 12, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514131640/http://www.garoweonline.com/english/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=558%3Asomalia-president-parliament-speaker-dispute-over-tfg-term&amp;catid=55%3Asomalia&amp;Itemid=79 |archivedate=May 14, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==From 2009 onwards==
{{Main article|War in Somalia (2009–present)}}
In November 2010, a new [[technocratic]] government was elected to office, which enacted numerous reforms. Among these, in its first 50 days in office, the new administration completed its first monthly payment of stipends to government soldiers.&lt;ref name="Swscmos"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.somaliweyn.org/pages/news/Jan_11/15Jan18.html |title=Security Council Meeting on Somalia |publisher=Somaliweyn.org |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140105060056/http://www.somaliweyn.org/pages/news/Jan_11/15Jan18.html |archivedate=January 5, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 6, 2011, Al-Shabaab was forced to withdraw from most areas of Mogadishu. Somali government forces and their AMISOM allies subsequently launched offensives in January 2012 on the insurgent group's last foothold on the northern outskirts of the city.&lt;ref name="Asefm"&gt;{{cite web|title=Al-Shabaab Evicted from Mogadishu|url=http://www.somaliareport.com/index.php/post/2572|publisher=Somalia Report|accessdate=February 14, 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222213444/http://www.somaliareport.com/index.php/post/2572|archivedate=February 22, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; An ideological rift within Al-Shabaab's leadership also emerged after the 2011 drought and the assassination of top officials in the organization.&lt;ref name="Csfdafbtas"&gt;{{cite web|last=Chothia |first=Farouk |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-14373264 |title=Could Somali famine deal a fatal blow to al-Shabab? |publisher=BBC |date=August 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Federal Government of Somalia was established in September 2012 (Bryden, Somalia Redux).

In January 2013, AMISOM's mandate was extended for another year following the adoption of UNSC [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 2093|Resolution 2093]]. The Security Council therein also unanimously voted to suspend Somalia's arms embargo on light weapons for a one-year period. Additionally, the Security Council welcomed the Federal Government's development of a new national security strategy, urging the central authorities to accelerate the plan's implementation, further define the Somali national security forces' composition, and identify capability gaps to assist their international partners in better addressing them.&lt;ref name="Resolution 2093"&gt;{{cite web|title=United Nations Security Council Resolution 2093|url=https://www.un.org/en/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=S/RES/2093%282013%29}} S/RES/2093 (2013), March 6, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; While many urban areas had been seized, Al-Shabaab still controlled many rural areas, where a number of their operatives disappeared into local communities in order to more effectively exploit any mistakes by the central authorities.&lt;ref name="Hammond"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hammond|first=Laura|title=Somalia rising: things are starting to change for the world's longest failed state|journal=Journal of Eastern African Studies|year=2013|volume=7|issue=1|pages=183–193|doi=10.1080/17531055.2012.755316|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/17531055.2012.755316#.UwDN-pgju1F|accessdate=February 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2014, at an African Union Summit in Addis Ababa, President [[Hassan Sheikh Mohamud]] requested an extension of the UN Security Council's weapons purchasing mandate for Somalia after its March expiration.

In February 2014, a delegation led by Prime Minister of Somalia [[Abdiweli Sheikh Ahmed]] met in Addis Ababa with Ethiopian Prime Minister [[Hailemariam Desalegn]] to discuss strengthening relations between the two countries. Ahmed commended Ethiopia's role in the ongoing peace and stabilization process in Somalia as well as its support against Al-Shabaab, and welcomed the Ethiopian military's decision to join AMISOM. Hailemariam Desalegn in turn pledged his administration's continued support for the peace and stabilization efforts in Somalia, as well as its preparedness to assist in initiatives aiming to build up the Somali security forces through experience-sharing and training. The meeting concluded with a tripartite Memorandum of Understanding agreeing to promote partnership and cooperation, including a cooperative agreement to develop the police force.&lt;ref name="Etpmosoavte"&gt;{{cite web|title=Ethiopia: The Prime Minister of Somalia On a Visit to Ethiopia|url=http://allafrica.com/stories/201402170065.html|publisher=Government of Ethiopia|accessdate=17 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 5 March 2014, the UN Security Council unanimously voted to extend the partial easing of the arms embargo on Somalia until 25 October of the year.&lt;ref name="Husceaelostem"&gt;{{cite news|title=UN Security Council Extends Arms Embargo lift on Somalia to eight months|url=http://horseedmedia.net/2014/03/06/un-security-council-extends-arms-embargo-somalia-eight-months/|accessdate=6 March 2014|newspaper=Horseed Media|date=6 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The resolution permits the Somali government to purchase light weapons, with the stipulation that all member states must take steps to prevent the direct or indirect supply, transfer or sale of arms and military equipment to individuals or entities outside of the Somali security forces.&lt;ref name="Husceaelostem"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Runepeosaeto"&gt;{{cite news|last=Charbonneau|first=Louis|title=U.N. extends partial easing of Somalia arms embargo to October|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/03/05/us-somalia-arms-un-idUSBREA241KZ20140305|accessdate=6 March 2014|newspaper=Reuters|date=6 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Somali government is also required to routinely report on the structural status of the military, as well as provide information on the extant infrastructure and protocols designed to ensure the military equipment's safe delivery, storage and maintenance.&lt;ref name="Runepeosaeto"/&gt;

In early March 2014, AMISOM, supported by Somali militias, launched another operation to remove Al-Shabaab from its remaining areas of control in southern Somalia.&lt;ref name="Gsfgatcwa"&gt;{{cite news|title=Somalia: Federal Govt, AMISOM troops clash with Al Shabaab |url=http://www.garoweonline.com/artman2/publish/Somalia_27/Somalia-Federal-Govt-AMISOM-troops-clash-with-Al-Shabaab_printer.shtml |accessdate=11 March 2014 |newspaper=Garowe Online |date=11 March 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140311152532/http://www.garoweonline.com/artman2/publish/Somalia_27/Somalia-Federal-Govt-AMISOM-troops-clash-with-Al-Shabaab_printer.shtml |archivedate=March 11, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Prime Minister Abdiweli Sheikh Ahmed, the government subsequently launched stabilization efforts in the newly liberated areas, which included [[Rab Dhuure]], [[Hudur]], [[Wajid, Somalia|Wajid]] and [[Burdhubo]]. The Ministry of Defence was providing ongoing reassurance and security to the local residents, and supplying logistical and security support. Additionally, the Ministry of Interior was prepared to support and put into place programs to assist local administration and security.

The '''strip search phone call scam''' is a series of incidents, mostly occurring in rural areas of the United States, that extended over a period of about twelve years, starting in 1992. The incidents involved a man calling a restaurant or grocery store, claiming to be a police officer and then convincing managers to conduct [[strip search]]es of female employees, and to perform other bizarre acts on behalf of "the police". The calls were most often placed to [[fast-food restaurant]]s in small towns.

Over 70 such occurrences were reported in 30 U.S. states,{{citation needed|date=October 2018}} until an incident in 2004 in [[Mount Washington, Kentucky]] which led to the arrest of David Richard Stewart. Stewart was acquitted of all charges in the Mount Washington case. He was suspected of, but never charged with, having made other, similar scam calls.&lt;ref name=cj-20051009&gt;{{cite news | first = Andrew | last = Wolfson | work= [[The Courier-Journal]] | url = https://www.courier-journal.com/story/news/local/2005/10/09/a-hoax-most-cruel-caller-coaxed-mcdonalds-managers-/28936597/ | archive-url =  | dead-url = no | archive-date =  | title = A hoax most cruel | date = 9 October 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wolfson"&gt;{{cite news |first=Andrew |last=Wolfson |title=Trial to start for $200 million lawsuit over strip-search hoax |url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2007-09-09-mcdonaldslawsuit_N.htm |work=[[The Courier-Journal]] |date=9 September 2007 |accessdate=2007-10-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Police reported that the scam calls ended after Stewart's arrest.

==Before the Mount Washington scam==
There were numerous prior incidents in many states which followed the pattern of the fraudulent call to a McDonald's restaurant in Mount Washington, Kentucky. Most of the calls were made to fast-food restaurants, but a few were made to grocery stores.

A caller who identified himself as a police officer or other authority figure would contact a manager or supervisor and would solicit their help in detaining a female employee or customer who was suspected of a crime. He would provide a description of the suspect, which the manager would recognize, and he would then ask the manager to search the suspected woman.

Some notable incidents were:
* Two calls were reported in 1992: one in [[Devils Lake, North Dakota]] and another in [[Fallon, Nevada]].&lt;ref name=cj-20051009/&gt;
* On November 30, 2000, a female McDonald's manager in [[Leitchfield, Kentucky]], undressed herself  in the presence of a customer. The caller had convinced her that the customer was a "suspected sex offender" and that the manager, serving as bait, would enable undercover police officers to arrest him.&lt;ref name=cj-20051009/&gt;
* On January 26, 2003, an [[Applebee's]] assistant manager subjected a waitress to a 90-minute strip search after receiving a [[collect call]] from someone who purported to be a regional manager for Applebee's.&lt;ref name=cj-20051009/&gt;
* In February 2003, a call was made to a McDonald's in [[Hinesville, Georgia]]. The female manager (who believed she was speaking to a police officer who was with the director of operations for the restaurant's upper management) took a female employee into the women's bathroom and strip-searched her. She also brought in a male employee, who conducted a [[body cavity search]] of the woman to "uncover hidden drugs." McDonald's and GWD Management Corporation (owner and operator of the involved McDonald's restaurant) were taken to court over the incident. In 2005, U.S. District Judge [[John F. Nangle]] granted a summary judgment to McDonald's and denied, in part, a summary judgment to GWD Management.&lt;ref&gt;30 March 2005, [http://www.onpointnews.com/docs/hoax.pdf case 4:03‑cv‑00167‑JFN], [[United States District Court for the Southern District of Georgia]], Savannah Division &lt;!-- the case name mentions the subject, so it has been excluded --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the judgments.&lt;ref&gt;28 September 2006, [http://www.ca11.uscourts.gov/unpub/ops/200516425.pdf D.

* In July 2003, a [[Winn-Dixie]] grocery store manager in [[Panama City, Florida]], received a call instructing him to bring a female cashier (who matched a description provided by the caller) into an office where she was to be strip-searched. The cashier was forced to undress and pose in various positions as part of the search. The incident ended when another manager entered the office to retrieve a set of keys.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sptimes.com/2003/07/15/State/Supermarket_superviso.shtml |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-07-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090608064530/http://www.sptimes.com/2003/07/15/State/Supermarket_superviso.shtml |archivedate=2009-06-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In March 2004, a female customer at a [[Taco Bell]] in [[Fountain Hills, Arizona]], was strip-searched by a manager who had received a call from a man claiming to be a police officer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first =  Anderson | last = Cooper | authorlink = Anderson Cooper | title = Transcript | work = [[Anderson Cooper 360°|AC-360]] | publisher = CNN | date = 30 March 2004 | url = http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0403/30/acd.00.html | accessdate = 4 January 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Mount Washington scam==&lt;!--linked from Compliance (film)--&gt;
On April 9, 2004, a call was made to a [[McDonald's]] restaurant in [[Mount Washington, Kentucky]]. According to assistant manager Donna Summers, the caller identified himself as a policeman, "Officer Scott." The caller gave Summers a vague description of a slightly built young white woman with blonde hair, who was suspected of theft. Summers believed the description provided was that of Louise Ogborn, a woman who was currently on duty at the restaurant.

The "police officer" demanded that Ogborn be searched at the restaurant because no officers were available at the moment to handle such a minor matter. Ogborn was brought into an office and ordered to remove her clothes, which Summers then placed in a bag and took to her car, as instructed. Ogborn then put on an apron to partially cover herself. Kim Dockery, another assistant manager,&lt;ref name="Wolfson"/&gt; was present at that time; Dockery believed she was there as a witness to the search.

Dockery left after an hour, and Summers told the caller that she needed to be working at the restaurant's counter. The caller then told Summers to bring in someone whom she trusted to assist with the investigation.&lt;ref name=cj-20051009/&gt; Summers first asked Jason Bradley, one of the restaurant's cooks, to watch Ogborn. When the caller ordered Bradley to remove Ogborn's apron and describe her, Bradley refused but did not attempt to call the police. Summers then called her fiancé Walter Nix Jr., who went to the restaurant and took over from Summers. After being told that a police officer was on the phone, Nix can be seen obeying the caller's instructions for the next two hours.

Nix removed the apron that Ogborn was wearing and ordered her to dance and perform [[Jumping Jack|jumping jacks]] while she was naked. Nix then ordered her to insert her fingers into her vagina and expose it to him as part of the "search." He also ordered her to sit on his lap and kiss him, and when she refused to do so, he spanked her until she promised to do it. The caller also spoke to Ogborn and demanded that she do as she was told or face worse punishment. Recalling the incident later, Ogborn said that, "I was scared for my life."

After Ogborn had been in the office for two and a half hours, she was ordered to perform [[oral sex]] on Nix. Summers returned to the office periodically, and during these times, Ogborn was instructed by the caller to cover herself with the apron. Nix became uneasy about what was happening. The caller then permitted him to leave on condition that Summers had to find someone to replace him. After Nix left, he called a friend and told him, "I have done something terribly bad."&lt;ref name="cj-20051009" /&gt;

With Nix having left, and short on staff due to the dinnertime rush, Summers needed someone to take Nix's place in the office. She spotted Thomas Simms, the restaurant's maintenance man, who had stopped in at the restaurant for dessert. She told Simms to go into the office and watch Ogborn. Simms, however, refused to go along with the caller's demands. At this point, Summers became suspicious and decided to call a higher-level manager (whom the caller earlier had claimed to have been speaking to on another phone line).

Speaking with her boss, Summers discovered that he had been sleeping and had not spoken to any police officer. She realized that the call had been fraudulent. The caller then abruptly ended the call. An employee dialed [[Last-call return|*69]] before another call could ring in, thus obtaining the number of the caller's telephone. Summers was now hysterical and began apologizing. Ogborn (shivering and wrapped in a blanket) was released from the office after three and a half hours. The police were called to the restaurant; they arrested Nix on a charge of [[sexual assault]] and began an investigation to find the perpetrator of the scam call.

The entire incident was recorded by a surveillance camera in the office. Summers watched the tape later that night and, according to her attorney, broke off her engagement with Nix.&lt;ref name=cj-20051009/&gt;

===Investigation, arrest, and trial===
Mount Washington police, after doing a simple word search on the Internet, quickly realized that this was only the latest in a long series of similar incidents that extended over a period of about 10 years. None of those incidents had continued as long, or with as many people involved, as the one in the Mount Washington McDonald's.

Although their initial suspicion was that the call had originated from a pay phone near the McDonald's restaurant (from which the perpetrator could see both the police station and the restaurant), police later determined that the call originated from a supermarket pay phone in [[Panama City, Florida]]. Having learned that the call was made with an [[AT&amp;T]] [[phone card]] and that the largest retailer of such cards was [[Walmart]], they contacted the police in Panama City.

The Panama City police informed the Mount Washington police that Detective Flaherty in Massachusetts was already conducting an investigation. Several similar scam calls had been placed to Boston-area restaurants, and Flaherty had already pulled [[surveillance camera]] footage from a Walmart in Panama City. Following Flaherty's lead, the Mount Washington police used the [[serial number]] of the phone card to find out that it had been purchased from a different Walmart than the Walmart that sold the card used for calls to Massachusetts restaurants.

Using the records of the Panama City Walmart, which showed the cash register and the time of purchase of the phone card, Mount Washington police were able to find surveillance camera footage of the purchaser of the card. The Massachusetts investigation had gone cold when their surveillance video failed to show the purchaser—the cameras had been trained on the store's parking lot and not on the cash registers.&lt;ref name=abc/&gt;

The purchaser in the Panama City video was wearing a [[Prison officer|correctional officer]]'s uniform of the kind used by [[Corrections Corporation of America]], a private security firm. Videos and still photographs from the two Walmarts were compared, and the same man was seen entering and exiting the Massachusetts Walmart at the time when a phone card was purchased there. Police used these images to produce front-and-back composite images of the suspect. Subsequent queries directed to the private security firm's human resources department led to the identification of the phone card buyer as David R. Stewart – a married man with five children – who was then arrested.

During his questioning by police, Stewart insisted he never had bought a phone card, but detectives found one in his home that had been used to call nine restaurants in the past year—including a call to a [[Burger King]] in [[Idaho Falls, Idaho]] on the same day when that restaurant's manager was reportedly duped by a scam call. Police also found in Stewart's home dozens of applications for police department jobs, hundreds of police magazines, as well as [[Police uniforms of the United States|police-style uniforms]], guns, and holsters. This was thought to indicate that the suspect had fantasized about being a police officer.&lt;ref name="cj-20051009" /&gt; 

Stewart was [[Extradition|extradited]] to Kentucky to be tried on charges of [[Police impersonation|impersonating a police officer]] and [[solicitation]] of [[sodomy]]. If convicted, Stewart faced up to 15 years in prison.&lt;ref name=abc/&gt; On October 31, 2006, he was acquitted of all charges. Both the defense and the prosecution attorneys stated that a lack of direct evidence may have affected the jury's decision, which found him not guilty.&lt;ref name=MSNBC&gt;{{cite news | last = | first = | coauthors = | title = Acquittal in hoax call that led to sex assault | work = | pages = | publisher = MSNBC | date = 31 October 2006 | url = http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/15504125/ | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090325234639/http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/15504125/ | archive-date = 25 March 2009 | accessdate = 16 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; He remained a suspect in similar cases throughout the United States.&lt;ref name="MSNBC" /&gt; Police stated later that since Stewart's arrest the scam calls had stopped.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | last = Associated Press | first = | author-link = Associated Press | title = U.S. jury awards $6.1 million to woman in McDonald's strip-search hoax | newspaper = [[International Herald Tribune]] | date = 5 October 2007 | url = http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2007/10/05/america/NA-GEN-US-Strip-Search-Hoax.php | postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt;}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aftermath===
Louise Ogborn, the victim, underwent therapy and medication to address [[post-traumatic stress disorder]] depression. She abandoned her plans to attend the [[University of Louisville]], where she had anticipated becoming a [[Pre-medical|pre-med]] student. In an interview with ABC News, she said that after her abuse she "felt dirty" and had difficulty making and maintaining friendships because she wouldn't "allow anyone to get too close to her".

Donna Summers ended her engagement with Nix soon after the incident.&lt;ref name=abc/&gt; She was fired from McDonald's for violating corporate policies prohibiting strip-searches and prohibiting anyone not employed by McDonald's from entering the restaurant's office.&lt;ref name="Wolfson"/&gt; She entered an [[Alford plea]] to a charge of [[False imprisonment|unlawful imprisonment]] (a [[misdemeanor]]) and received one year of [[probation]]. She was not charged with any sex-related crime.&lt;ref name=abc/&gt;

Kim Dockery was transferred to another location. Walter Nix pleaded guilty to [[sexual abuse]], sexual misconduct and unlawful imprisonment in his trial. The judge agreed to a plea deal for Nix in exchange for his testimony against David Stewart.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://abcnews.go.com/Primetime/story?id=1728839&amp;page=1l |title = Man Gets 5 Years for Role in Fast-Food Strip Search Ploy |publisher = ABC NEWS |date = 15 March 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Because he was the principal perpetrator of the beating and had engaged in the sex act, he received a five-year prison sentence.&lt;ref name="MSNBC" /&gt;

====Lawsuits====
Three years after the incident, still undergoing therapy, Louise Ogborn sued McDonald's for $200 million for failing to protect her during her ordeal. Her grounds for the suit were:

* that McDonald's corporate headquarters were aware of the danger of a possible hoax because they had defended themselves against lawsuits over similar incidents at its restaurants in four other states
* that McDonald's had been subjected to similar hoaxes at least two years before the Mount Washington incident and they had not taken appropriate action as directed by their own chief of security and as outlined in his memo to McDonald's upper management&lt;ref name=abc&gt;{{cite news | url = http://abcnews.go.com/2020/Story?id=2684890 | title = Strip-Search Case Closed? | publisher = ABC News | date = 30 November 2007 |access-date = 30 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Donna Summers also sued McDonald's, asking for $50 million, for failing to warn her about the previous hoaxes.&lt;ref name="Wolfson"/&gt;

McDonald's based its defense on four points:
#Summers deviated from the company's management manual, which prohibits strip-searches, and therefore McDonald's should not be held responsible for any action of Summers outside the scope of her employment;
#[[workers' compensation]] law prohibited employees from suing their employer;
#Nix, who actually performed the acts, was not a McDonald's employee; and
#the victim did not remove herself from the situation, contrary to common sense.&lt;ref name=cj-20051009/&gt;

The civil trial began September 10, 2007, and ended October 5, 2007, when a jury awarded Ogborn $5 million in [[punitive damages]] and $1.1 million in compensatory damages and expenses. Summers was awarded $1 million in punitive damages and $100,000 in compensatory damages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=[[Associated Press]] |title=Ex-McDonald's worker wins lawsuit over strip search |work= |publisher=CTV |date=6 October 2007 |url=http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20071006/mc_lawsuit_071006 |accessdate=23 March 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100304062757/http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20071006/mc_lawsuit_071006 |archivedate=4 March 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The jury decided that McDonald's and the unnamed caller were each 50% at fault for the abuse to which the victim was subjected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Schreiner | first = Bruce | url = http://www.redorbit.com/news/general/1091834/mcdonalds_worker_wins_stripsearch_suit/ | title = McDonald's Worker Wins Strip-Search Suit | publisher = The Associated Press | date = 6 October 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; McDonald's and its attorneys were [[Sanctions (law)|sanctioned]] for withholding evidence pertinent to the outcome of the trial.&lt;ref&gt;http://indianalawblog.com/archives/2007/09/07/&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2008, McDonald's also was ordered to pay $2.4 million in legal fees to plaintiffs' lawyers.&lt;ref name="wolfsonC-J"&gt;{{Cite news|last=Wolfson |first=Andrew |title=Judge: Company must pay legal fees |work=[[The Courier-Journal]] |date=15 November 2008 |url=http://search.courier-journal.com/sp?eId=213&amp;gcId=64792167&amp;rNum=4&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fnl.newsbank.com%2Fcgi-bin%2Fngate%2FLCJB%3Fext_docid%3Dlou62457799%26ext_hed%3DJudge%3A+Company+must+pay+legal+fees%26s_site%3Dcourier-journal%26ext_theme%3Dgannett%26pubcode%3DLCJB%26usefield%3Dsqn&amp;siteIdType=2 |postscript= }}{{dead link|date=April 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 20, 2009, the Kentucky Court of Appeals upheld the jury's verdict but reduced the punitive damages award to Summers to $400,000.&lt;ref name="Appeals court upholds $6 million award in McDonald's strip search case."&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wave3.com/Global/story.asp?S=11545266|title=Appeals court upholds $6 million award in McDonald's strip search case|date=20 November 2009|work=www.wave3.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; McDonald's then appealed to the Kentucky Supreme Court. While its petition was pending in 2010, Ogborn settled with McDonald's for $1.1 million and abandoned her claim for punitive damages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=McDonald's and strip-search victim settle lawsuit|author=|date=26 March 2010|newspaper=The Courier-Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the court decisions, McDonald's revised its manager-training program to emphasize awareness of scam phone calls and protection of employees' rights.&lt;ref name="MSNBC" /&gt;

===Media depiction===
The Mount Washington McDonald's scam has been the basis of four media depictions:

* A short film ''Plainview'',&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1082864 ''Plainview'']&lt;/ref&gt; which played the [[Film festival|festival circuit]] in 2007–2008.
* [[Authority (Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit)|Episode 17 of season 9]] of the television show ''[[Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit]]'' (April 29, 2008) featured [[Robin Williams]] as the caller. The character played by Williams identified himself as Detective Milgram, a reference to the famous [[Milgram experiment]], which studied unreasonable obedience to authority.
* The 2012 feature film ''[[Compliance (film)|Compliance]]'', directed by [[Craig Zobel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lim|first1=Dennis|title=‘Compliance’ Raises Questions About Human Behavior|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/12/movies/compliance-raises-questions-about-human-behavior.html|accessdate=3 July 2017|work=The New York Times|date=10 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Compliance"&gt;{{cite news |title=COMPLIANCE, writer-director, Craig Zobel |url=http://www.filmmakermagazine.com/news/2012/01/compliance-writer-director-craig-zobel/ |work=[[Filmmaker Magazine]] |date=21 January 2012 |accessdate=2012-01-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The 2016 play ''Mai Dang Lao'', written by David Jacobi,&lt;ref&gt;[http://chicagocritic.com/mai-dang-lao/ ''Mai Dang Lao'' review at Chicago Critic web site]&lt;/ref&gt; which opened at the Victory Gardens Theatre in Chicago.

"'''Sunday Bloody Sunday'''" is a song by Irish [[Rock music|rock]] band [[U2]]. It is the opening track from their 1983 album ''[[War (U2 album)|War]]'' and was released as the album's third single on 21 March 1983 in [[Germany]] and the [[Netherlands]].&lt;ref name=U2W2&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.u2wanderer.org/disco/sing012.html |title= U2 Discography – Sunday Bloody Sunday Single |last= U2Wanderer.org |accessdate= 22 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Sunday Bloody Sunday" is noted for its militaristic drumbeat, harsh guitar, and melodic harmonies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first= Robert |last= Hillburn |date= 8 August 2004 |url= http://www.atu2.com/news/article.src?ID=3472 |title= The Songwriters – U2 – 'Where Craft Ends and Spirit Begins' |work= Los Angeles Times |accessdate= 22 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of U2's most overtly political songs,  its lyrics describe the horror felt by an observer of [[the Troubles]] in [[Northern Ireland]], mainly focusing on the [[Bloody Sunday (1972)|Bloody Sunday]] incident in [[Derry]] where British troops shot and killed unarmed civil rights protesters, bystanders and children. At the same time, the lyrics reject hate and revenge as a response, as noted in the line "There's many lost, but tell me who has won." Along with "[[New Year's Day (U2 song)|New Year's Day]]," the song helped U2 reach a wider listening audience. It was generally well received by critics on the album's release.&lt;ref name=HP&gt;{{cite news|first= Liam |last= Mackey|date=18 February 1983 |url= http://atu2.com/news/article.src?ID=2594 |title= Review of ''War'' |work= Hot Press |accessdate= 22 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=AMG&gt;{{cite web |last= Sullivan |first= Denise |url= http://www.allmusic.com/song/sunday-bloody-sunday-mt0006410688 |title= Song Review: "Sunday Bloody Sunday" |work= Allmusic |accessdate= 22 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The song has remained a staple of U2's live concerts.&lt;ref name=live&gt;{{cite web|last= U2-Vertigo-Tour.com |url= http://www.u2-vertigo-tour.com/song11.html |title= U2 on Tour – played songs: Sunday Bloody Sunday |accessdate= 22 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; During its earliest performances, the song created controversy. Lead singer [[Bono]] reasserted the song's anti-sectarian-violence message to his audience for many years. Today, it is considered one of U2's [[signature song]]s, and is one of the band's most performed tracks. Critics rate it among the best political [[protest song]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video|people= VH1 Editors |date= 2004 |title= VH1's 25 Greatest Political Protest Songs |url= http://www.vh1.com/shows/dyn/the_greatest/68962/episode_countdown.jhtml|medium=Television series |publisher=VH1 television}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it has been [[Cover version|covered]] by over a dozen artists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last= U2Wanderer.org |url= http://www.u2wanderer.org/disco/covers.html |title= U2 Cover Songs Discography |accessdate= 22 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was named the 272nd-greatest song by ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' on their list of "[[Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Songs of All Time|The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time]]."

==Writing and recording==
"Sunday Bloody Sunday" grew from a guitar riff and lyric written by [[the Edge]] in 1982. While newlyweds [[Bono]] and [[Ali Hewson]] honeymooned in [[Jamaica]], the Edge worked in Ireland on music for the band's upcoming album. Following an argument with his girlfriend, and a period of doubt in his own song-writing abilities, the Edge—"feeling depressed... channelled [his] fear and frustration and self-loathing into a piece of music."&lt;ref name=U2-by-U2&gt;McCormick (2006), pp. 135–139&lt;/ref&gt; This early draft did not yet have a title or chorus melody, but did contain a structural outline and theme. After Bono had reworked the lyrics, the band recorded the song at [[Windmill Lane Studios]] in Dublin. During the sessions, producer [[Steve Lillywhite]] encouraged drummer [[Larry Mullen, Jr.]] to use a [[click track]], but Mullen was firmly against the idea. A chance meeting with [[Andy Newmark]] of [[Sly &amp; the Family Stone]] – a drummer who used a click track religiously – changed Mullen's mind.&lt;ref name=U2-by-U2/&gt; The opening drum pattern soon developed into the song's hook. A local violinist, [[Steve Wickham]], approached the Edge one morning at a bus stop and asked if U2 had any need for a violin on their next album. In the studio for only half a day, Wickham's electric violin became the final instrumental contribution to the song.&lt;ref name=U2-by-U2/&gt;

The direct impetus for the lyrics was an encounter with [[Irish Republican Army (1922–69)|IRA]] supporters in [[New York City]].&lt;ref name="RStone397"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Henke|first=James |title=Blessed Are the Peacemakers|journal=[[Rolling Stone]]|date=June 9, 1983 |issue=397|pages=11–14}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a promotional gimmick, U2 manager [[Paul McGuinness]] had made arrangements for the band to appear in the 1982 [[St. Patrick's Day Parade (New York)|St. Patrick's Day parade]]. However, he later found that there was a possibility that [[Bobby Sands]], an IRA hunger striker who had starved to death the previous year, would be the parade's honorary marshal. As they felt that the IRA's tactics were prolonging the fighting in Northern Ireland, McGuinness and the band members mutually decided they should withdraw from the parade. McGuinness met with one of the parade's organizers in a New York bar to arrange the cancellation, and ended up in a heated debate about the IRA. McGuinness recalled, "He kept telling me to keep my voice down. The place was full of New York policemen - Irish cops - and he thought I was going to get us killed."&lt;ref name="RStone397"/&gt;

Drummer Mullen said of the song in 1983:

&lt;blockquote&gt;We're into the politics of people, we're not into politics. Like you talk about Northern Ireland, 'Sunday Bloody Sunday,' people sort of think, 'Oh, that time when 13 Catholics were shot by British soldiers'; that's not what the song is about. That's an incident, the most famous incident in Northern Ireland and it's the strongest way of saying, 'How long? How long do we have to put up with this?' I don't care who's who – Catholics, Protestants, whatever. You know people are dying every single day through bitterness and hate, and we're saying why? What's the point? And you can move that into places like [[Salvadoran Civil War|El Salvador]] and other similar situations – people dying. Let's forget the politics, let's stop shooting each other and sit around the table and talk about it... There are a lot of bands taking sides saying politics is crap, etc. Well, so what! The real battle is people dying, that's the real battle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://u2_interviews.tripod.com/id18.html |title= Larry Mullen Interview |publisher= White Lucy |date= 1 April 1983 |accessdate= 6 November 2007 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080724225720/http://u2_interviews.tripod.com/id18.html |archivedate= 24 July 2008 |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Composition==
[[Image:Sunday Bloody Sunday riff A.svg|left|thumb|350 px|This two-[[Bar (music)|bar]] guitar [[riff]]&lt;ref name=SM&gt;Commercial sheet music for "Sunday Bloody Sunday." ''Universal-Polygram International Music Publishing''. Distributed by Hal Leonard Publishing.  {{ISBN|0-7119-7309-1}}. Retrieved 12 December 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; is repeated often throughout "Sunday Bloody Sunday."]]
"Sunday Bloody Sunday" is played at a [[tempo]] of 103 beats per minute in a 4/4 [[time signature]].&lt;ref name=SM/&gt; The song opens with a militaristic drumbeat and [[electric violin]] part; the aggressive [[snare drum]] rhythm closely resembles a beat used to keep a [[military band]] in step. The distinctive drum sound was achieved by recording Mullen's drumwork at the base of a staircase, producing a more natural [[reverb]]. It is followed by [[the Edge]]'s repeating [[arpeggio]]s (see notation at left). The riff, which follows a [[B minor|Bm]]–[[D (musical note)|D]]–[[G (musical note)|G]]&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; chord progression, establishes the [[minor chord]] territory of the piece. As the song progresses, the lyrics and guitar become more furious. The guitar riff has been described as the "bone-crushing arena-rock riff of the decade" by ''[[Rolling Stone]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last= Connelly |first= Christopher |date= 19 January 1984 |url= https://www.rollingstone.com/reviews/album/102415/under_a_blood_red_sky |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080419073338/http://www.rollingstone.com/reviews/album/102415/under_a_blood_red_sky |archivedate= 19 April 2008 |title= Under A Blood Red Sky Review: U2: Review |magazine= [[Rolling Stone]] |accessdate= 17 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[bass drum]] kick on every beat provides the musical foundation until the first chorus, when [[Adam Clayton]]'s bass guitar enters.

In contrast to the violent nature of the verses, the emergence of [[major chord]]s creates a feeling of hope during Bono's "How long, how long must we sing this song?" refrain. During the chorus, the Edge's backing vocals further develop this tread, using a harmonic imitative echo. The snare drum is absent from this section, and the guitar parts are muted. This part of the song deviates musically from the raw aggression seen in the song's verses and gives the song a more uplifting structure.&lt;ref name=SM/&gt; Bono once commented that "love is...a central theme" of "Sunday Bloody Sunday"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first= Tristam |last= Lozaw |date= 1 June 1984 |url= http://atu2.com/news/article.src?ID=1878 |title= Love, Devotion &amp; Surrender |work= U2 Magazine |accessdate= 22 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The band have said the lyrics refer to the events of both Bloody Sunday in 1972 and [[Bloody Sunday (1920)|Bloody Sunday]] in 1920, but are not specifically about either event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video |people= U2, Rona Elliot (interviewer) |url= http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewVideo?id=155853858&amp;p=156472332&amp;s=143441 |title= U2: The Rona Elliot Interview |medium= Online download |publisher= NBC via iTunes Store |date= 11 September 1987 |accessdate= 22 October 2006 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110606203142/http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewVideo?id=155853858&amp;p=156472332&amp;s=143441 |archivedate= 6 June 2011 |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The song takes the standpoint of someone horrified by the cycle of violence in the province. Bono rewrote the Edge's initial lyrics, attempting to contrast the two events with [[Easter Sunday]], but he has said that the band were too inexperienced at the time to fully realise that goal, noting that "it was a song whose eloquence lay in its harmonic power rather than its verbal strength."&lt;ref name=U2-by-U2/&gt;

Early versions opened with the line "Don't talk to me about the rights of the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army|IRA]], [[Ulster Defence Association|UDA]]."&lt;ref name=U2-by-U2/&gt; U2's bassist, [[Adam Clayton]], recalls that better judgment led to the removal of such a politically charged line, and that the song's "viewpoint became very humane and non-sectarian...which, is the only responsible position."&lt;ref name=ITH&gt;Stokes (1996), pp. 37–39&lt;/ref&gt; The chosen opening line, "I can't believe the news today" crystallises the prevailing response, especially among young people, to the violence in Northern Ireland during the 1970s and 1980s.&lt;ref name=ITH/&gt; In successive stanzas, the lyrics paraphrase religious text from [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]] [[wikisource:Bible (King James)/Matthew#10:35|10:35]] ("mother's children; brothers, sisters torn apart") and bring a twist to [[First Epistle to the Corinthians|1 Corinthians]] [[wikisource:Bible (King James)/1 Corinthians#15:32|15:32]] ("we eat and drink while tomorrow ''they'' die", instead of "let us eat and drink; for tomorrow ''we'' die").  The song finishes with a call for the Irish to stop fighting each other, and "claim the victory Jesus won...on [a] Sunday bloody Sunday."&lt;ref name=SM/&gt;

==Reception==
U2 were aware when they decided to record "Sunday Bloody Sunday" that its lyrics could be misinterpreted as [[sectarian]], and possibly place them in danger. Some of the Edge's original lyrics explicitly spoke out against violent rebels, but were omitted to protect the group.&lt;ref name=U2-by-U2/&gt; Even without these lyrics, some listeners still considered it to be a [[Irish rebel music|rebel song]]—even one which glorifies the events of the two Bloody Sundays to which the lyrics refer.&lt;ref&gt;Flanagan (1996), p. 385&lt;/ref&gt;

Commercially, the single had its biggest impact in the Netherlands, where it reached number 3 on the national charts.&lt;ref name=NL/&gt; In the US, the song gained significant [[album-oriented rock]] radio airplay, and together with the earlier "New Year's Day" helped expose U2 to a mainstream American rock audience.

Critical reception to the song was positive. In the Irish magazine ''[[Hot Press (magazine)|Hot Press]]'', Liam Mackey wrote that "Sunday Bloody Sunday" "takes the widescreen view...a powerful riff and machine-gun drumming [is] crisscrossed by skipping violin."&lt;ref name=HP/&gt; [[Denise Sullivan]] commented for ''[[Allmusic]]'' that Mullen's opening drumwork "helps set the tone for the unforgiving, take-no-prisoners feel of the song, as well as for the rest of the album."&lt;ref name=AMG/&gt;

In 2010, ''Rolling Stone'' ranked "Sunday Bloody Sunday" 272nd on its list of "[[Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Songs of All Time|The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url= https://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/the-500-greatest-songs-of-all-time-20110407/u2-sunday-bloody-sunday-20110526 |title= 500 Greatest Songs of All Time: U2, 'Sunday Bloody Sunday' |journal= [[Rolling Stone]] |year= 2010 |issue= Special collectors edition}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, ''[[Q (magazine)|Q]]'' named "Sunday Bloody Sunday" the 18th-greatest song of the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title= 80 Best Records of the '80s |magazine= [[Q (magazine)|Q]] |date= August 2006 |issue= 241}}&lt;/ref&gt; The staff of the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] selected "Sunday Bloody Sunday" as one of [[500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.rockhall.com/exhibithighlights/500-songs-tv/ |title= 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll |work= [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] |accessdate= 8 November 2010 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080602080941/http://www.rockhall.com/exhibithighlights/500-songs-tv/ |archivedate= 2 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[New Statesman]]'' listed it as one of the Top 20 Political Songs,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.newstatesman.com/music/2010/03/u2-sunday-bloody-political |title= Top 20 Political Songs: Sunday Bloody Sunday |first= Ian K |last= Smith |work= [[New Statesman]] |date= 25 March 2010 |accessdate= 25 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and similarly, ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' named it one of the Top 10 Protest Songs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://entertainment.time.com/2010/05/04/kent-state-40-years-later-top-10-protest-songs/slide/sunday-bloody-sunday-1983-u2/|title= Top 10 Protest Songs: 'Sunday Bloody Sunday' |work= [[Time (magazine)|Time.com]] |publisher= [[Time Inc.]] |first= Alexandra |last= Silver |date= 14 December 2011 |accessdate= 11 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Live performances==
"Sunday Bloody Sunday" has been performed more than 600 times by U2.&lt;ref name=live/&gt; It was first heard by a live audience in December 1982 in Glasgow, Scotland, on a twenty-one show "Pre-[[War Tour]]." The band were particularly nervous about playing the song in [[Belfast]], Northern Ireland. Introducing the song there at the Maysfield Leisure Centre, Bono stated "It's not a rebel song.", attempted to further clarify this point by reciting the entire second verse ("Broken bottles under children's feet ..."), and added as a final note, "If you don't like it, you let us know."&lt;ref name="RStone397"/&gt; The crowd overwhelmingly enjoyed the song; the Edge recalls that "the place went nuts, it drew a really positive reaction.", also saying that "We thought a lot about the song before we played it in Belfast and Bono told the audience that if they didn't like it then we'd never play it again. Out of the 3,000 people in the hall about three walked out. I think that says a lot about the audience's trust in us."&lt;ref&gt;McCormick (2006), p. 179&lt;/ref&gt; The band remained apprehensive, however. Even by the song's sixth performance, Bono was introducing the song with the statement "This song is ''not'' a rebel song."&lt;ref&gt;de la Parra (1995)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://u2_interviews.tripod.com/id19.html |title= War &amp; Peace |last= Thrills |first= Adrian |accessdate= 7 November 2007 |work= NME |date= 26 February 1983 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110717104003/http://u2_interviews.tripod.com/id19.html |archivedate= 17 July 2011 |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout 1983's War Tour, Bono continued to reassure audiences that "This song is not a rebel song, this song is 'Sunday Bloody Sunday'"&lt;ref&gt;U2. ''Under a Blood Red Sky''. Island Records. Compact disc, 1983.&lt;/ref&gt; highlighting the non-[[Partisan (political)|partisan]] intentions of the lyrics. The live performances on this tour featured a routine during which Bono would set a [[white flag]] in the front of the stage while the band [[Vamp (music)|vamp]]ed three chords—B minor, D major, and G major. (though the band traditionally tune their instruments down a half step so the chords are B flat minor, D flat and G Flat). As the band vamped, Bono would sing "no more!" with the audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video|people= U2, Gavin Taylor (director) |url= https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0275013/ |title= Under a Blood Red Sky |medium= VHS |publisher= RCA / Columbia Video |date= 1983}}&lt;/ref&gt; These performances were highly effective with U2's audience (at the time, U2 were most popular as a [[college rock]] act). Live performances of the song subsequently appeared on their 1983 live album ''[[Under a Blood Red Sky]]'' and their concert film ''[[Live at Red Rocks: Under a Blood Red Sky]]''. In the [[Unforgettable Fire Tour]] of 1984 and 1985, "Sunday Bloody Sunday" continued to be a prominent midpoint of each U2 concert—as did the "no more!" interlude. Along with a performance of "[[Bad (U2 song)|Bad]]," the song was performed at [[Live Aid]] in July 1985.

As U2 reached new levels of fame in 1987 with ''[[The Joshua Tree]]'', "Sunday Bloody Sunday" continued to be a focal point of concerts. Some performances featured slower, more contemplative versions of the song; other concerts saw the wilder, more violent version. This tour marked the first time "Sunday Bloody Sunday" was played in [[Northern Ireland]] since 1982, and it has not been performed there since.&lt;ref name=live/&gt;

The 1988 [[rockumentary]] ''[[Rattle and Hum]]'' includes a particularly renowned version of the song, recorded on 8 November 1987 at [[McNichols Sports Arena]] in [[Denver|Denver, Colorado]].&lt;ref&gt;Chatterton (2001)&lt;/ref&gt; On this version Bono's mid-song rant angrily and emphatically condemns the [[Remembrance Day Bombing]] that had occurred earlier that same day in the Northern Irish town of [[Enniskillen]]:

{{quote|And let me tell you somethin'. I've had enough of Irish Americans who haven't been back to their country in twenty or thirty years come up to me and talk about the ''resistance'', the revolution back home...and the ''glory'' of the revolution...and the glory of ''dying'' for the revolution. Fuck the revolution! They don't talk about the glory of killing for the revolution.  What's the glory in taking a man from his bed and gunning him down in front of his wife and his children? Where's the glory in that? Where's the glory in bombing a Remembrance Day parade of old age pensioners, their medals taken out and polished up for the day. Where's the glory in that? To leave them dying or crippled for life or dead under the rubble of a revolution that the majority of the people in my country don't want. No more!&lt;ref name="RH"&gt;{{cite video|people= U2, Phil Joanou (director) |url= https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0096328/ |title= U2: Rattle and Hum |medium= DVD |publisher= Paramount |date=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Image:U2 MexicoCity1.jpg|left|thumb|This concert in Mexico City in February 2006 depicts the elaborate stage effects used for "Sunday Bloody Sunday."]]
After the Joshua Tree Tour, Bono was heard saying the band might never play the song again, because the song was "made real" with the performance in Denver, and it could never be matched again.&lt;ref name="RH"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first= Liam |last= Mackey |date= 1 December 1998 |url= http://atu2.com/news/article.src?ID=2436 |title= I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For – Part 1 |work= Hot Press |accessdate= 22 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following their original intent, "Sunday Bloody Sunday" was not played during any of the forty-seven shows on the [[Lovetown Tour]] in 1989. The song reappeared for a brief period during the [[Zoo TV Tour]], and late during the second half of [[PopMart Tour]] (1997–1998), U2 played an emotional concert in war-ravaged [[Sarajevo]] that included a solo performance of the song by [[the Edge]]. "Sunday Bloody Sunday" was subsequently played live in this style until the end of the tour in March 1998.&lt;ref name=live/&gt;

"Sunday Bloody Sunday" was played at every concert on the 2001 [[Elevation Tour|Elevation]] and 2005–2006 [[Vertigo Tour|Vertigo]] tours.&lt;ref name=live/&gt; Performances in 2001 frequently included parts of [[Bob Marley]]'s "[[Get Up, Stand Up]]" and "Johnny Was". A memorable mid-song message referencing the [[Omagh bombing]] of 1998 ("Turn this song into a prayer!") is captured on the live DVD ''[[U2 Go Home: Live from Slane Castle]]''. In concerts in New York City after the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]], the "no more!" interlude was replaced by Bono holding an [[Flag of the United States|American flag]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first= Isaac |last= Guzman |date= 26 October 2001 |title= No Bombast, but U2 Bands Together with N.Y. |work= New York Daily News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Sunday Bloody Sunday" was used during the Vertigo Tour of 2005 and 2006, often alongside "[[Bullet the Blue Sky]]" and "Love and Peace or Else" as a trio of politically driven songs performed during the middle part of the band's set. Bono extended the "no more!" interlude to explain a headband he had donned in the previous song.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video|people= U2, Hamish Hamilton (director) |url= https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0488664/ |title= Vertigo 2005: U2 Live from Chicago |medium= DVD |publisher= Island / Interscope Video |date= 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; The headband depicted the word "coexist" (written to depict a [[crescent]], a [[Star of David]], and a [[Christian cross]]). The Coexist symbol is trademarked in the United States by an [[Limited liability partnership|LLP]] in [[Indiana]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.atu2.com/news/article.src?ID=3995 |title= Can't We All Just Coexist? |last= Hutchinson |first= Kevin |accessdate= 16 December 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the original artwork was created in 2001 by a Polish artist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://zafryki.art.pl/coex/coex.html |title= Jerozolimie |accessdate= 16 December 2006 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070706153347/http://zafryki.art.pl/coex/coex.html |archivedate= 6 July 2007|language=pl}}&lt;/ref&gt; As with the 2001 shows, the Vertigo tour saw the song applied to subjects further afield than The Troubles in Northern Ireland. During 2006 Australian shows, in Brisbane, Bono asked for Australian Terrorism suspect [[David Hicks]] to be brought home and tried under Australian laws. In subsequent Australian concerts he dedicated the song to the victims of the [[2002 Bali bombing]]s{{spaced ndash}}where 88 of the fatalities were Australians{{spaced ndash}}saying 'This is your song now!'.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_vj3p7Bew U2 Concert, Sydney 11 Nov 2006].&lt;/ref&gt; The song was also performed at every concert on the [[U2 360° Tour]], paying tribute to the [[2009 Iranian election protests]] on each occasion by projecting scenes from the protests and [[Persian language|Persian]] writing in green on the video screen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title= Lunch with Bono|series=Edith Bowman |url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b00m3zzc/Edith_Bowman_Lunch_with_Bono/ |network= [[BBC]] |station= [[BBC Radio 1]] |location= London, England |minutes= 35:30 |airdate= 19 August 2009 |accessdate= 19 August 2009}}{{expired link|date=September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Sunday Bloody Sunday" has been played as the opening song at shows on [[the Joshua Tree Tour 2017]].

==Music video==
[[Image:U2 Sunday Bloody Sunday Red Rocks.jpg|right|thumb|This performance in June 1983 from the concert film ''U2 Live at Red Rocks'' was later released as the song's music video.]]
Although a promotional music video had not been produced for the original release, the band used footage from a 5 June 1983 live performance filmed for the [[concert film]] ''[[U2 Live at Red Rocks: Under a Blood Red Sky]]'' to promote the song. Directed by Gavin Taylor, the video displays Bono's use of a [[white flag]] during performances of the song. The video highlights the intensity and emotion felt by many audience members during U2's concerts, while the rainy, torch-lit setting in [[Colorado]]'s [[Red Rocks Amphitheatre]] further adds to the atmosphere.  In 2004, ''Rolling Stone'' cited the performance as one "50 Moments that Changed the History of Rock and Roll" and noted that "the sight of Bono singing the anti-violence anthem 'Sunday Bloody Sunday' while waving a white flag through crimson mist (created by a combination of wet weather, hot lights and the illumination of those crags) became the defining image of U2's warrior-rock spirit and—shown in heavy rotation on MTV—broke the band nationwide."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last= Cave |first= Damien|date= 24 June 2004 |title= U2's Gamble at Red Rocks |magazine= [[Rolling Stone]] |page= 146|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other releases==
The album version of "Sunday Bloody Sunday" was originally included on ''[[War (U2 album)|War]]'', but it can also be heard on a number of promotional releases, including the compilations ''[[The Best of 1980-1990]]'' and ''[[U218 Singles]]''.  Several live versions have been released; the video available on ''Live at Red Rocks: Under a Blood Red Sky'' is from a performance at [[Red Rocks Amphitheatre]] in June 1983, but the version on the live album ''Under a Blood Red Sky'' is from a performance on August 20, 1983 during the Rockpalast Open Air music festival at the [[Lorelei]], (West) [[Germany]].  Audio from the [[Sarajevo]] concert of 1997 is featured as a b-side on 1997's single "[[If God Will Send His Angels]]."  The song also appears on ''Rattle and Hum'', ''[[PopMart: Live from Mexico City]]'', ''[[Elevation 2001: Live from Boston]]'', ''[[U2 Go Home: Live from Slane Castle]]'', ''[[Vertigo 2005: Live from Chicago]]'', ''[[Live from Paris (U2 video)|Live from Paris]]'', ''[[U2 3D]]'', ''[[U2 360° at the Rose Bowl]]'' and in the closing credits of the 2002 TV film ''[[Bloody Sunday (film)|Bloody Sunday]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last= U2Wanderer.org |url= http://www.u2wanderer.org/disco/songs.html |title= U2Wanderer.org – U2 Discography – By Song U2 Discography |accessdate= 22 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last= U2Wanderer.org |url= http://www.u2wanderer.org/disco/video.html |title= U2Wanderer.org – U2 Discography – U2 Video and DVD Releases |accessdate= 22 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The only concert films that "Sunday Bloody Sunday" does not appear on are ''[[Zoo TV: Live from Sydney]]'' and ''[[Vertigo 05: Live from Milan]]''.

==In popular culture==
In 2007, [[The Roots]] covered "Sunday Bloody Sunday" in a medley with "[[Pride (In the Name of Love)]]" for an NAACP dinner honouring Bono. While the band played the song, [[Black Thought]] rapped lines from the band's own "False Media" and bits of [[Edwin Starr]]'s "War".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.covermesongs.com/2010/08/the-roots-sunday-bloody-sunday-pride-in-the-name-of-love.html |title= Song of the Day: The Roots, "Sunday Bloody Sunday / Pride (In the Name of Love)" (U2 cover) |author= Ray Padgett |publisher= Cover Me |date= 16 August 2010

In 2008, [[Jay-Z]] sampled "Sunday Bloody Sunday" in a version of "Heart of the City" performed at the [[Glastonbury Festival]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jay-Z vs U2 - Heart Of The Bloody City (MTM's Glastonbury 2008 Edit)|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nkVAEcCBeeA|publisher=YouTube|accessdate=8 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; During a version of "Sunday Bloody Sunday" performed by the band at the 2009 [[MTV Europe Music Awards]], Jay-Z improvised lyrics over the breakdown in the song before including a snippet of "[[Get Up, Stand Up]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=EMAs: Jay-Z Joins U2 on Stage!|url=http://www.mtv.co.uk/ema/news/emas-jayz-joins-u2-on-stage|publisher=MTV.co.uk|accessdate=6 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Formats and track listings==
"Sunday Bloody Sunday" was commercially released throughout most of Europe in support of U2's album ''[[War (U2 album)|War]]''. Its cover art is the same as that of "[[Two Hearts Beat as One]]," except on the [[Japan]] release. The [[A-side and B-side|B-side]] on the single, "Endless Deep," is one of the few U2 songs that features bassist [[Adam Clayton]] singing.

'''Teatro Dante''' (''also called Cinema Teatro Dante'') is an Italian [[theatre]] in [[Sansepolcro]], a town in [[Tuscany]], [[Italy]], in the [[province of Arezzo]].
The theatre was inaugurated on September 1, 1836 and was originally known as the '''Royal Theatre Dante''' (''Regio Teatro Dante''). The premiere performance was [[Vincenzo Bellini]]'s opera [[La sonnambula]] (''The sleepwalker'').
The building, remained the property of the '''Accademia dei Risorti''' ( ''literally "Academy of the Resurrected"'' ) until today.
The building began as a simple theater for the people, nowadays it is also a [[movie theater]], not precluding a theater season with comedies, operettas and concerts in a good level.

== History ==

=== The origin and the theatre of fortune ===
The news reached the present day are fragmentary, but carefully preserved.
We know that the project was commissioned by [[Cosimo III de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany]] in September 1674 to promote culture in the provinces of his grand duchy. So, he settled 1500 [[Italian scudo|scudi d'oro]] for the construction of a large room then made it a theatre, to keep the youth well trained and better eloquent to serve the prince. The first name was '''Teatro della Fortuna''' (''the fortune theatre''), and was left under management to a local association, ''Accademia degli Sbalzati'', led by the poet '''Pietro Gherardi'''. The first theatre was built entirely in wood. In 1727 the academy ceases to exist. From the ashes of the old one, a new association was born with the name of '''academy of the nobles''' who will reevaluate the structure and it will enhance the activities.

[[File:Sansepolcro Accademia dei Risorti, Stemma.jpg|thumbnail|left|Blazon of Accademia dei Risorti]]

=== The nineteenth century and the Dante theatre ===
The activity of the theatre will proceed regularly until 1832 when the last known association will born after the merge of the two local academies: ''The Nobles'' and ''The Resurrected'', that will form the '''Academy of the Nobles Resurrected'''. To witness this union the new blazon of the association is an olive tree, cut at the lower end with new branches on the sides that are growing back, that which symbolizes the definitive rebirth of this association. The academy will not be the only one to be renewed. The old theater, now dilapidated and in poor condition, will be demolished in favor of a new building, built in stone in front of the old theater. Work will begin in 1833, a year after the birth of the new academy, led by the florentine Francesco Leoni and continued until August 1836. On September 1, the new theater called '''royal Dante theatre''' was inaugurated with [[La Sonnambula]] by [[Vincenzo Bellini]]. The name of the theater was chosen to pay tribute to one of the most important poets of Italy, the florentine [[Dante Alighieri]].

=== The restoration and the movie theater ===
Over the years, the structure adapts to the times starting to show the first film shows in the 50s, after the [[Second World War]]. After those tragic years, the Academy resumed full control of the theater, valuing it as a movie theater. For this step, very important for the history of the theater, we must not forget the role of '''Luigi Monti''', the [[Regia Aeronautica]] pilot in World War II.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Bernardo Monti |title=Sono un Aviatore non un Assassino &amp;#124; The biography |url=http://www.asso4stormo.it/arc_08/SonoUnAviatore.htm |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923175449/http://www.asso4stormo.it/arc_08/SonoUnAviatore.htm |archivedate=2015-09-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; "The Colonel" (''as it was called by everyone'') worked hard for the complete reorganization of the theater and the academy, adapting it to current standards.
It will transform the academy in a society becoming the [[director-general]] in new business. The new company will bring as name "'''Academy of Risorti S.r.L.'''" (literally ''Academy of the Resurrected ltd.''). Until his death, Monti cured with love and passion the redevelopment of film programming and theater shows. From 1975 to 1994, they were carried out the first restoration of the modern age, driven by engineers Vittorio Landi and Perugino Perugini. Among the work carried out there is the renewal of the wooden chairs, replaced by red velvet chairs, the restoration of the paintings and interior decorations, the renewal of the floor of the [[stalls (theatre)|stalls]] and its main structures.

=== Recent developments ===
To remain open, today the theater Dante plays an assiduous work as a movie theater, in order to propose periodically events and other kind of shows (''like operettas, concertos and theatre season, and other live events''). As a movie theater, uses the same policy, trying to offer various types of entertainment for all categories of users. The cinema was one of the first in the province in the 90s install the multi-channel digital audio, offering to the audience the sounds of [[Dolby Digital]] and [[Digital Theater Sound|DTS]]. The digitization process ends in 2011, when it was purchased the professional [[digital projector]], that can offer to the audiences, [[3D film|3D feature presentation movies]] and other [[stereoscopic]] contents.

== Description ==
Thanks to assiduous care, the theater space, even of medium size, has come to this day still intact with its [[neoclassical architecture|neo-classical]] style, which makes it one of the most beautiful historic theaters in Tuscany.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author= |title=Fondazione Toscana Spettacolo &amp;#124; regional theatrical network|url=http://www.toscanaspettacolo.it/teatro/teatro-dante-2/}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theater is built according to the specifications of the nineteenth century [[teatro all'italiana|Italian theaters]], the main architectural features are the construction of the hall with a plant horseshoe, the elimination of the bleachers in favor of in favor of more box tiers, and the enlargement of the stage in favor of the new perspective wings. In the theater there are a total of 400 seats, divided in 190 seats in the stalls and in four tiers of boxes. There is also a small [[orchestra pit]]. Both the stalls that the stage has a little slope that is vanished in the area of pit.

== The Academy ==
The academy of resurrected, as we know it nowadays, was established in 1953, with the aim of making management activities of theaters, cinemas, and other opportunities for entertainment and education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author= |title=Siusa Archives|url=http://siusa.archivi.beniculturali.it/cgi-bin/pagina.pl?TipoPag=prodente&amp;Chiave=29477}}&lt;/ref&gt; The component of the Academy are formed mostly by the old nobles family present in Sansepolcro. Over the years, academics have changed several times, acquiring or disposing their shareholdings in the company. A famous member of the academy was the family [[Buitoni]].
The statute of the academy expressed clearly that the company was created with the same intent of its ancient founders, and that any proceeds obtained will be invested to support the running costs and adapt the structures to the times. No academic earns money from the theater and its activities.

[[File:Sansepolcro, Cinema Teatro Dante, Interno da palcoscenico.jpg|thumb|500px|left|Internal vision of the theater.]]

=== The academics and the boxes ===
The theater Dante underwent natural transformation of small theaters Italian born largely in the [[Renaissance]], which have been transformed from theater ''to multi-purpose halls''. During the renaissance, the nobles of Sansepolcro manage this theater for personal prestige and to be able to present artistic and cultural performances to the entire population. It followed, as usual, that every noble had his reserved seat, away from ordinary people, according to his shareholding in association. The most prominent members were sitting in the most central seats, the others, hand in hand in the more laterals. The nobles didn't sat in the stalls, but they were on the upper floors, in the boxes. Originally it seems were not present even the chairs in the stalls, and that some performances were paid exclusively by the nobility to exercise more prestige in town. Ordinary people, in the early years it seems that should bring home a chair, if they wanted to sit. To remember the tradition of the boxes, still it reserves the "'''academic box'''" ''the number 8 box on the first floor'' that however isn't the '''royal box''' (''called also the central box, the number 9 in second tier of boxes'').

== Trivia ==
* the theater was used by Italian director [[Mario Monicelli]] for the shooting of the movie [[Rossini! Rossini!]] After much research, it was the only theater in the center Italy who was willing to remove the bulbs and put candles and candlesticks during filming.

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He claimed these were produced using [[psychic]] powers. Serios' psychic claims were bolstered by the endorsement of a [[Denver]]-based psychiatrist, [[Jule Eisenbud]] (1908–1999), who published a book named ''The World of Ted Serios: "Thoughtographic" Studies of an Extraordinary Mind'' (1967) arguing that Serios' purported psychic abilities were genuine.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jule Eisenbud]]. (1967). ''The World of Ted Serios: "Thoughtographic" Studies of an Extraordinary Mind''. Morrow. {{ISBN|978-1117065625}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, professional photographers and skeptics have argued that Serios and his photographs were fraudulent.&lt;ref name="Hines2003"&gt;[[Terence Hines]]. (2003). ''Pseudoscience and the Paranormal''. Prometheus Books. p. 77. {{ISBN|978-1573929790}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Len Peyronnin. (2011). [http://chronicle.com/article/Psychic-Projections-Were-a/126934/ ''Psychic Projections Were a Hoax'']. [[The Chronicle of Higher Education]]. "Anyone who knows anything about this issue knows that Mr. Serios was long ago exposed and thoroughly debunked as a fraud. This was done with absolute certainty by professional photographers Charlie Reynolds and David Eisendrath in the October 1967 issue of Popular Photography. Serios was observed, when he thought no one was looking, sticking pictures into his "gizmo," a tube he held between his head and the camera lens. That some claim he produced images without the tube, and at some distance from the camera, is easily attributed to double exposure or use of previously made exposures, followed by the fake snapping of a picture."&lt;/ref&gt;

== History and method ==

Serios was an unemployed bellhop when his claims that he had the ability to put images on film with his mind came to the attention of [[Jule Eisenbud]].&lt;ref name="JoeNickell-CameraClues"/&gt; He was tested by Eisenbud at Denver during a period of three years.&lt;ref&gt;[[Leonard Zusne]], Warren Jones. (1982). ''Anomalistic Psychology: A Study of Extraordinary Phenomena of Behavior and Experience''. Lawrence Erlbaum Associates. p. 411. {{ISBN|978-0898590685}}&lt;/ref&gt; Serios usually held a small cylinder or tube he called a "gizmo" up to the lens of an instant camera, which was then pointed at his forehead and the shutter released. He would often be drunk, or at least have been drinking, when he produced his photographs.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Thomas Sladek]]. (1974). ''The New Apocrypha: A Guide to Strange Science and Occult Beliefs''. Stein and Day. p. 218. {{ISBN|978-0812817126}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Serios' images were most often blank or black. Occasionally, a fuzzy image would be seen that could be interpreted in many different ways (cf. [[pareidolia]]), but on rare occasions a relatively clear and identifiable image showed up although often appearing surrounded by dark areas on the film.&lt;ref&gt;[[James Randi]]. (2011). [http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/swift-blog/1223-those-spooky-photos-are-back.html ''Those Spooky Photos Are Back...'']. James Randi Educational Foundation.&lt;/ref&gt; On some occasions, his photos appeared to be distorted, or altered versions of real places or images, e.g., one such photo seemed to be of Eisenbud's ranch showing the barn as a different structure to the reality. Another photograph depicted part of a building identified later as a hangar belonging to the Air Division of the [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]], however in the photograph there was a misspelling "CAINADAIN" for "CANADIAN" on the imaged sign.&lt;ref&gt;Alfred Douglas. (1982). ''Extra-Sensory Powers: A Century of Psychical Research''. Overlook Press. p. 301&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John Fairley, Simon Welfare. (1984). ''Arthur C. Clarke's World of Strange Powers''. Putnam. p. 78&lt;/ref&gt; Eisenbud attempted to prove that previously unidentified photographs were actually of the surface of [[Ganymede (moon)|Ganymede]]. In Eisenbud's own words, "Unfortunately, I couldn't get an astronomer or optical scientist to agree."&lt;ref&gt;Jule Eisenbud. (1983). ''Parapsychology and the Unconscious''. North Atlantic Books. p. 132. {{ISBN|978-1556431388}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Psychology ==

According to Eisenbud, "Ted Serios exhibits a behavior pathology with many character disorders. He does not abide by the laws and customs of our society. He ignores social amenities and has been arrested many times. His [[psychopathic]] and [[Psychopathy|sociopathic]] personality manifests itself in many other ways. He does not exhibit self-control and will blubber, wail and bang his head on the floor when things are not going his way."&lt;ref&gt;Nile Root. (2002). [http://www.niler.com/es8.html Thoughtography]. p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; Serios was described as an [[Alcoholism|alcoholic]].&lt;ref&gt;Rodger Anderson. (2006). ''Psychics, Sensitives And Somnambules: A Biographical Dictionary With Bibliographies''. McFarland &amp; Company. p. 156. {{ISBN|978-0786427703}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Critical reception ==

In an article in the October 1967 issue of the magazine ''[[Popular Photography]]'', Charlie Reynolds and David Eisendrath, both amateur magicians and professional photographers, claimed to have exposed Serios as a fraud after spending a week-end with him and Eisenbud.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Reynolds. (1967). "An Amazing Weekend with Ted Serios. Part I". ''Popular Photography'' (October): 81–84, 136–40, 158.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David Eisendrath. (1967). "An Amazing Weekend with Ted Serios: Part II". ''Popular Photography'' (October): 85–87, 131–33, 136.&lt;/ref&gt; Reynolds and Eisendrath said they spotted Serios slipping something into the tube that Serios claimed he needed to help him concentrate. They surmised this was a picture of something that the camera would take an image of, but which Serios would claim came from his mind rather than his hand.&lt;ref name="Carroll2003"&gt;[[Robert Todd Carroll]]. (2003). ''[[The Skeptic's Dictionary|The Skeptic's Dictionary: A Collection of Strange Beliefs, Amusing Deceptions, and Dangerous Delusions]]''. Wiley. p. 313. {{ISBN|978-0471272427}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert Todd Carroll]] later wrote "after the exposure he remained virtually unheard from for the past 30 years."&lt;ref name="Carroll2003"/&gt;

In 1968, [[W. A. H. Rushton]] a Professor of physiology and President of the [[Society for Psychical Research]] rejected any paranormal interpretation of the photographs. He suggested that it was light that formed the photographs from a luminous picture placed in front of the [[camera lens]] hidden in the 'gizmo'. Rushton successfully replicated the Serios phenomenon by holding a little reflecting prism that contained a microfilm picture against the camera lens.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Thomas Sladek]]. (1974). ''The New Apocrypha: A Guide to Strange Science and Occult Beliefs''. Stein and Day. pp. 223-224. {{ISBN|978-0812817126}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[James Randi]], [[Magician (illusion)|stage magician]] and noted [[Scientific skepticism|scientific sceptic]], took an interest in investigating Serios. Randi claimed Serios used "a simple handheld optical device" to perform his photographic trickery.&lt;ref&gt;[[James Randi]]. (1997). [http://www.randi.org/encyclopedia/thoughtography.html ''Thoughtography''] in ''An Encyclopedia of Claims, Frauds, and Hoaxes of the Occult and Supernatural'' St. Martin's Griffin. {{ISBN|978-0312151195}}&lt;/ref&gt; Randi wrote he replicated the trick of Serios on a live television show in New York and Eisenbud was "flabbergasted".&lt;ref&gt;[[James Randi]]. (2003). [https://archive.is/20060927064328/http://www.randi.org/jr/091903.html ''Yellow Bamboo Surprise, Fear of Technology, and Answering Montague Keen'']. James Randi Educational Foundation.&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Terence Hines]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Serios would use what he called a "gizmo," a tube of paper placed against the camera lens. He said this helped him to focus his mental energy and direct it toward the film. He also used something he didn't tell anyone about—- a tiny tube about one inch long and one-half inch in diameter. This tube had a tiny magnifying lens at one end. In the other end one could insert a piece cut from a standard 35mm slide. Lined up properly, this device projected the image on the cut piece of transparency onto the film of the Polaroid camera. The device was small enough to be concealed in the palm of the hand, so it could be used even when the larger paper "gizmo" wasn't around to conceal it.&lt;ref name="Hines2003"/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In an article in ''[[New Scientist]]'' titled "The Chance of a Lifetime" (24 March 2007), an interview appears with the noted mathematician and magician [[Persi Diaconis]]. During the interview Diaconis mentioned that [[Martin Gardner]] had paid him to watch Ted Serios perform, during which Diaconis claimed that he caught Serios sneaking a small marble with a photograph on it into the little tube attached to the front of the camera he used. "It was," Diaconis said, "a trick."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg19325961.800-interview-the-chance-of-a-lifetime.html|author=Justin Mullins|date=2007|title=Interview: The chance of a lifetime|work=New Scientist|accessdate=March 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gardner wrote that "the parapsychologists who once took Ted Serios and others like him seriously would have been spared their embarrassments had they known anything about magic."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csicop.org/si/show/mind_at_play_an_interview_with_martin_gardner/|author=Kendrick Frazier|date=1998|title=A Mind at Play: An Interview with Martin Gardner|work=Skeptical Inquirer|accessdate=March 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Popular culture ==

Thoughtography was the premise of ''[[The X-files]]'' episode "[[Unruhe]]". ''The X-Files'' producer [[Chris Carter (screenwriter)|Chris Carter]] signed a deal to base an entire movie on Dr. Eisenbud's book.&lt;ref&gt;Mary Carole McCauley. (2011). [http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2011-02-20/entertainment/bs-ae-umbc-psychic-projections-20110217_1_ted-serios-exhibit-believers-and-skeptics ''An Artist's Instant Mystery'']. [[The Baltimore Sun]].&lt;/ref&gt; He was also featured and interviewed in an episode of ''[[Arthur C. Clarke's World of Strange Powers]]'' in 1985.

'''The Notorious IBE''' is an international Hiphop and Urban dance festival in [[Heerlen]], [[The Netherlands]]. Between 1998 and 2005 the festival took place at [[Nighttown]] in [[Rotterdam]], the Netherlands.  In 2008 the festival moved to the city of Heerlen in the southern province of [[Limburg (Netherlands)]].

The Notorious IBE is a festival catering to both insiders and outsiders of the culture and offering the visitots a unique blend of music, dance and cultural programs.

Each IBE edition comes to life through “a collaboration of friends and partners”.  These “friends and partners” curate their own programs, invite their own artists, present their own projects and cater to their own following. The result is a long weekend of 50-60 programs varying from music performances, dance battles, dance shows, workshops, talkshows, film, photography and art. In recent years the number of typical festival facilities such as a culture market, creative space and a festival food court has been growing. Making the IBE a unique event in the worldwide Hiphop and urban dance world.

The 15th edition of The Notorious IBE takes place at 1,2 August in the city of Heerlen.  On the 31st of July the festival unofficially kicks of with a Block Jam and pre parties in the city center.

'''''The Scarlet Empress''''' is a 1934 American [[historical drama film]] made by [[Paramount Pictures]] about the life of [[Catherine II of Russia|Catherine the Great]]. It was directed and produced by [[Josef von Sternberg]] from a screenplay by [[Eleanor McGeary]], loosely based on the diary of Catherine arranged by [[Manuel Komroff]].

Even though substantial historical liberties are taken, the film is viewed positively by modern critics.&lt;ref&gt;Roger Ebert, [http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/great-movie-the-scarlet-empress-1934 ''The Scarlet Empress'' Review], January 16, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Derek Malcolm, [https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2000/may/25/artsfeatures Josef von Sternberg: ''The Scarlet Empress''], May 25, 2000, ''The Guardian''.&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Scarlet Empress'' is particularly notable for its attentive lighting and the [[expressionism|expressionist]] [[art design]] von Sternberg creates for the Russian palace.

The film stars [[Marlene Dietrich]] as Catherine, supported by [[John Davis Lodge]], [[Sam Jaffe]], [[Louise Dresser]], and [[C. Aubrey Smith]]. Dietrich's daughter [[Maria Riva]] plays Catherine as a child.

==Plot==
[[File:Scarlett Empress - film (1934) Marlene Dietrich and John Davis Lodge 1.jpg|thumb|left|Princess Sophie (Marlene Dietrich) and Alexey Razumovsky (John Davis Lodge)]]
Sophia Frederica ([[Marlene Dietrich]]) is the daughter of a minor [[Germany|German]] prince and an ambitious mother. She is brought to Russia by [[Alexei Razumovsky|Count Alexei]] ([[John Davis Lodge]]) at the behest of [[Elizabeth of Russia|Empress Elizabeth]] ([[Louise Dresser]]) to marry her nephew, [[Peter III of Russia|Grand Duke Peter]] (played as a half-wit by [[Sam Jaffe]] in his film debut). The overbearing Elizabeth renames her Catherine and reinforces the demand the new bride issue an heir to the throne.

Unhappy in her marriage, Catherine finds solace with the womanizing Alexei, first and foremost a paramour of the much-older Elizabeth. Rebuffed at this discovery, she takes lovers among the [[Imperial Russian Army|Russian Army]] to court its favor. When the old Empress dies seventeen years into their marriage, Peter ascends to the Russian throne and takes steps against his wife. Soon Catherine plots and exercises a coup, beginning a reign as Empress that will leave her known to history as ''Catherine the Great''.

Josef von Sternberg described ''The Scarlet Empress'' as "a relentless excursion into style".&lt;ref&gt;Josef Von Sternberg. ''Fun in a Chinese Laundry''. Mercury House, 1988. P. 265.&lt;/ref&gt; The historical accuracy is sacrificed for the sake of "a visual splendor verging on madness".&lt;ref&gt;Charles Silver. ''Marlene Dietrich''. Pyramid Publications, 1974. P. 51.&lt;/ref&gt; To show Russia as backward, anachronistic and in need of reform, the imperial court was set at the [[Moscow Kremlin]] rather than in Saint Petersburg, a more Europeanized city.&lt;ref name="nation"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LY8NCkSfySoC&amp;pg=PA141|title=Popularizing National Pasts: 1800 to the Present|first1=Stefan|last1=Berger|first2=Chris|last2=Lorenz|first3=Billie|last3=Melman|date=21 August 2012|publisher=Routledge|accessdate=21 October 2017|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; The royal palaces are represented as made of wood and full of religious sculptures (in fact, there is no free-standing religious sculpture in the Orthodox tradition). Pete Babusch from Switzerland created hundreds of [[gargoyle]]-like sculptures of male figures "crying, screaming, or in throes of misery" which "line the hallways, decorate the royal thrones, and even appear on serving dishes".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=d0KLBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT289|title=Fifty Hollywood Directors|first1=Suzanne|last1=Leonard|first2=Yvonne|last2=Tasker|date=20 November 2014|publisher=Routledge|accessdate=21 October 2017|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; This resulted in "the most extreme of all of the cinematic representations of Russia".&lt;ref name="nation"/&gt; In film critic [[Robin Wood (film critic)|Robin Wood]]'s words:
{{quote|"A hyperrealist atmosphere of nightmare with its gargoyles, its grotesque figures twisted into agonized contortions, its enormous doors that require a half-dozen women to close or open, its dark spaces and ominous shadows created by the flickerings of innumerable candles, its skeleton presiding over the royal wedding banquet table."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.criterion.com/current/posts/1 |title=The Scarlet Empress |author=Robin Wood |publisher=The Criterion Collection Online Cinematheque}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== Sexual connotations ==
{{See also|Nudity in film}}
''The Scarlet Empress'' was one of the last mainstream Hollywood motion pictures to be released before the [[Hays Code]] was strictly enforced, and the film depicts [[Toplessness|topless]] women being tortured and burnt at the stake. ''The Scarlet Empress'' remains one of Marlene Dietrich's most frank and suggestive films, portraying Russia's future empress [[Catherine the Great]] first as a wide eyed innocent, quickly becoming a sexually-hungry [[dominatrix]]. The film is filled with erotic images and [[Motif (narrative)|motifs]].
