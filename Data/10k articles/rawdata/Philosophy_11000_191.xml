'''20th-century philosophy''' saw the development of a number of new philosophical schools—including [[logical positivism]], [[analytic philosophy]], [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]], [[existentialism]], and [[poststructuralism]]. In terms of the eras of philosophy, it is usually labelled as ''[[contemporary philosophy]]'' (succeeding [[modern philosophy]], which runs roughly from the time of [[René Descartes]] until the late 19th to early 20th centuries).

As with other academic disciplines, philosophy increasingly became [[professionalized]] in the twentieth century, and a split emerged between philosophers who considered themselves part of either the "[[analytic philosophy|analytic]]" or "[[Continental philosophy|Continental]]" traditions. However, there have been disputes regarding both the terminology and the reasons behind the divide, as well as philosophers who see themselves as bridging the divide, such as [[process philosophy]] advocates&lt;ref&gt;{{cite SEP |url-id=process-philosophy |title=Process Philosophy |last=Seibt |first=Johanna}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[neopragmatist]]s.&lt;ref&gt;William Egginton/[[Mike Sandbothe]] (eds.). ''The Pragmatic Turn in Philosophy. Contemporary Engagement between Analytic and Continental Thought.'' SUNY Press. 2004. Back cover.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, philosophy in the twentieth century became increasingly technical and harder for lay people to read.

The publication of [[Edmund Husserl]]'s ''[[Logical Investigations (Husserl)|Logical Investigations]]'' (1900–1) and [[Bertrand Russell]]'s ''[[The Principles of Mathematics]]'' (1903) is considered to mark the beginning of 20th-century philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;''Spindel Conference 2002 – 100 Years of Metaethics. The Legacy of G. E. Moore'', University of Memphis, 2003, p. 165.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Analytic philosophy==
{{main|Analytic philosophy}}
Analytic philosophy is a generic term for a style of [[philosophy]] that came to dominate [[English-speaking countries]] in the 20th century. In the [[United States]], [[United Kingdom]], [[Canada]], [[Scandinavia]], [[Australia]], and [[New Zealand]], the overwhelming majority of university philosophy departments identify themselves as "analytic" departments.&lt;ref name="Searle03P1"&gt;
"Without exception, the best philosophy departments in the United States are dominated by analytic philosophy, and among the leading philosophers in the United States, all but a tiny handful would be classified as analytic philosophers. Practitioners of types of philosophizing that are not in the analytic tradition—such as phenomenology, classical pragmatism, existentialism, or Marxism—feel it necessary to define their position in relation to analytic philosophy."
[[John Searle]] (2003) ''Contemporary Philosophy in the United States'' in N. Bunnin and E. P. Tsui-James (eds.), ''The Blackwell Companion to Philosophy'', 2nd ed., (Blackwell, 2003), p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Epistemology===
{{main| Epistemology}}
Epistemology in the Anglo-American tradition was radically shaken up by the publication of [[Edmund Gettier]]'s 1963 paper "Is Justified True Belief Knowledge?" This paper provided counter-examples to the traditional formulation of knowledge going back to Plato. A huge number of responses to the [[Gettier problem]] were formulated, generally falling into [[internalism|internalist]] and [[externalism|externalist]] camps, the latter including work by philosophers like [[Alvin Goldman]], [[Fred Dretske]], [[David Malet Armstrong]], and [[Alvin Plantinga]].

===Logical positivism===
{{main|Logical positivism}}
Logical positivism (also known as logical empiricism, scientific philosophy, and neo-positivism) is a philosophy that combines [[empiricism]]—the idea that observational evidence is indispensable for knowledge—with a version of [[rationalism]] that incorporates mathematical and logico-linguistic constructs and deductions of [[epistemology]]. The [[Vienna Circle]] was a group that promoted this philosophy.&lt;ref name="ViennaCircleSEP"&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia|last=Uebel|first=Thomas|author-link=Thomas Uebel|editor-last=Zalta|editor-first=Edward N.|editor-link=Edward N. Zalta|encyclopedia=[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]|title=Vienna Circle|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2016/entries/vienna-circle/|access-date=31 May 2018|edition=Spring 2016|orig-year=First published 28 June 2006|publisher=The Metaphysics Research Lab|publication-place=Stanford University|publication-date=17 February 2016|issn=1095-5054|dead-url=no|at=Introduction|quote=While the Vienna Circle's early form of logical empiricism (or logical positivism or neopositivism: these labels will be used interchangeably here) no longer represents an active research program, recent history of philosophy of science has unearthed much previously neglected variety and depth in the doctrines of the Circle's protagonists, some of whose positions retain relevance for contemporary analytical philosophy.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Neopragmatism===
{{main|Neopragmatism}}
Neopragmatism, sometimes called linguistic pragmatism is a recent philosophical term for philosophy that reintroduces many concepts from [[pragmatism]]. The Blackwell dictionary of Western philosophy (2004) defines "Neo-pragmatism" as follows: "A [[postmodernism|postmodern]] version of pragmatism developed by the American philosopher [[Richard Rorty]] and drawing inspiration from authors such as [[John Dewey]], [[Martin Heidegger]], [[Wilfrid Sellars]], [[Willard Van Orman Quine|W.V.O. Quine]], and [[Jacques Derrida]]. It repudiates the notion of universal truth, epistemological foundationalism, representationalism, and the notion of epistemic objectivity. It is a nominalist approach that denies that natural kinds and linguistic entities have substantive ontological implications.

===Ordinary language philosophy===
{{main|Ordinary language philosophy}}
Ordinary language philosophy is a philosophical school that approaches traditional philosophical problems as rooted in misunderstandings philosophers develop by distorting or forgetting what words actually mean in everyday use. This approach typically involves eschewing philosophical "theories" in favour of close attention to the details of the use of everyday, "ordinary" language. Sometimes called "Oxford philosophy", it is generally associated with the work of a number of mid-century Oxford professors: mainly [[J. L. Austin]], but also [[Gilbert Ryle]], [[H. L. A. Hart]], and [[P. F. Strawson|Peter Strawson]]. The later [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] is ordinary language philosophy's most celebrated proponent outside the Oxford circle. Second generation figures include [[Stanley Cavell]] and [[John Searle]].

==Continental philosophy==
{{main|Continental philosophy}}
Continental philosophy, in contemporary usage, refers to a set of traditions of 19th and 20th century [[philosophy]] from mainland [[Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Leiter|2007|p=2}}: "As a first approximation, we might say that philosophy in Continental Europe in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries is best understood as a connected weave of traditions, some of which overlap, but no one of which dominates all the others."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|editor-first=Simon |editor-last=Critchley |editor2-first=William |editor2-last=Schroder|first=Simon|last=Critchley|contribution=Introduction: what is continental philosophy?|title=A Companion to Continental Philosophy|series=Blackwell Companions to Philosophy|location=Malden, MA|publisher=Blackwell Publishing Ltd|year=1998|page=4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  This sense of the term originated among English-speaking philosophers in the second half of the 20th century, who used it to refer to a range of thinkers and traditions outside the [[analytic philosophy|analytic movement]]. Continental philosophy includes the following movements: [[German idealism]], [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]], [[existentialism]] (and its antecedents, such as the thought of [[Kierkegaard]] and [[Nietzsche]]), [[hermeneutics]], [[structuralism]], [[post-structuralism]], [[Feminism#French feminism|French feminism]], the [[critical theory]] of the [[Frankfurt School]] and related branches of [[Western Marxism]], and [[psychoanalytic theory]].&lt;ref&gt;The above list includes only those movements common to both lists compiled by {{harvnb|Critchley|2001|p=13}} and {{harvnb|Glendinning|2006|pp=58–65}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Existentialism===
{{main|Existentialism}}
Existentialism is generally considered a philosophical and cultural movement that holds that the starting point of philosophical thinking must be the individual and the experiences of the individual. For Existentialists, religious and ethical imperatives may not satisfy the desire for individual identity, and both theistic and atheistic existentialism tend to resist mainstream religious movements. Common themes are the primacy of experience, [[Angst]], [[Absurdism|the Absurd]], and [[Authenticity (philosophy)|authenticity]].

===Marxism===
{{main|Western Marxism}}
Western Marxism, in terms of 20th-century philosophy, generally describes the writings of [[Marxist philosophy|Marxist theoreticians]], mainly based in [[Western Europe|Western]] and [[Central Europe]]; this stands in contrast with the Marxist [[philosophy in the Soviet Union]]. While [[György Lukács]]'s ''History and Class Consciousness'' and [[Karl Korsch]]'s ''Marxism and Philosophy'', first published in 1923, are often seen as the works that inaugurated this current.  [[Maurice Merleau-Ponty]] coined the phrase ''Western Marxism'' much later.

===Phenomenology===
{{main|Phenomenology (philosophy)}}
Phenomenology is the study of the phenomena of experience. It is a broad [[philosophical movement]] founded in the early years of the 20th century by [[Edmund Husserl]]. Phenomenology, in Husserl's conception, is primarily concerned with the systematic reflection on, and study of, the structures of [[consciousness]] and the [[phenomena]] that appear in acts of consciousness. This phenomenological ontology can be clearly differentiated from the Cartesian method of analysis, which sees the world as objects, sets of objects, and objects that act and react upon one another.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}

===Post-structuralism===
{{main|Post-structuralism}}
Post-structuralism is a label formulated by American academics to denote the heterogeneous works of a series of French intellectuals who came to international prominence in the 1960s and  '70s.&lt;ref name="Bensmaia05"&gt;Bensmaïa, Réda ''Poststructuralism'', article published in [[Lawrence D. Kritzman|Kritzman, Lawrence]] (ed.) ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=bREQibN9i-sC The Columbia History of Twentieth-Century French Thought]'', Columbia University Press, 2005, pp. 92–93&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Poster88"&gt;[[Mark Poster]] (1988) [https://books.google.com/books?id=-OnWAAAAMAAJ ''Critical theory and poststructuralism: in search of a context''], section ''Introduction: Theory and the problem of Context'', pp. 5–6&lt;/ref&gt; The label primarily encompasses the intellectual developments of prominent mid-[[20th-century French philosophy|20th-century French]] and [[Continental philosophy|Continental philosophers]] and theorists.&lt;ref name="Merquior1987"&gt;Merquior, J.G. (1987). Foucault ([[Fontana Modern Masters]] series), University of California Press, {{ISBN|0-520-06062-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Structuralism===
{{main|Structuralism}}
Structuralism is a theoretical paradigm that emphasizes that elements of culture must be understood in terms of their relationship to a larger, overarching system or "structure." Alternately, as summarized by philosopher [[Simon Blackburn]], Structuralism is "the belief that phenomena of human life are not intelligible except through their interrelations. These relations constitute a structure, and behind local variations in the surface phenomena there are constant laws of abstract culture".&lt;ref name="Blackburn"&gt;[[Simon Blackburn|Blackburn, Simon]] (2008). Oxford Dictionary of Philosophy, second edition revised. Oxford: Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0-19-954143-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Benedict Hyman Gross''' (born June 22, 1950) is an American mathematician, the George Vasmer Leverett Professor of Mathematics at [[Harvard University]] and former Dean of Harvard College.&lt;ref name="cv"&gt;[http://www.math.harvard.edu/~gross/CV09.pdf Curriculum vitae] from Gross' web site at Harvard, retrieved 2010-04-21.&lt;/ref&gt;

He is known for his work in [[number theory]], particularly the [[Gross–Zagier theorem]] on [[L-function]]s of [[elliptic curve]]s, which he researched with [[Don Zagier]].

==Professional career==
In 1971 he graduated [[Phi Beta Kappa]] from Harvard University.  He then received an M.Sc. from [[Oxford University]] as a [[Marshall Scholar]] in 1974 before returning to Harvard and completing his Ph.D. in 1978, under [[John Tate]].&lt;ref name="cv"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mg"&gt;{{MathGenealogy|id=12980}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After holding faculty positions at [[Princeton University]] and [[Brown University]], Gross became a tenured professor at Harvard in 1985&lt;ref name="cv"/&gt; and has remained there ever since, as Dean of Harvard College from 2003 to 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2003/4/8/gross-officially-named-dean-of-the/ Gross Officially Named Dean of the College], ''[[Harvard Crimson]]'', April 8, 2003; [http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2003/5/16/gross-stretches-to-prepare-for-new/ Gross Stretches to Prepare for New Roles], ''[[Harvard Crimson]]'', May 16, 2003; [http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2007/6/29/with-goals-accomplished-gross-leaves-overhauled/ With Goals Accomplished, Gross Leaves Overhauled College: His efforts were to 'improve the undergraduate experience,' dean says], ''[[Harvard Crimson]]'', June 29, 2007; [http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2007/9/21/exit-gross-the-magic-of-gross/ Exit Gross], ''[[Harvard Crimson]]'', September 21, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; He was elected as a fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1992&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amacad.org/members/class_section.pdf List of Active Members by Classes], [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]], retrieved 2010-04-21.&lt;/ref&gt; and as a member of the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]] in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scienceblog.com/community/older/2004/8/20047575.shtml National Academies news: 72 new members chosen by academy], The National Academies, April 2004, retrieved 2010-04-21.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of his past Ph.D. students was [[Noam Elkies]].&lt;ref name="mg"/&gt;

Benedict Gross was the mathematical consultant&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0343328/| title=Benedict Gross – Miscellaneous Crew| publisher=IMDb.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; for the 1980 film [[It's My Turn (film)|It's My Turn]] containing the famous scene&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etbcKWEKnvg |title=It's My Turn (1980) Snake Lemma}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which [[Jill Clayburgh]] impeccably proves the [[snake lemma]].

==Awards and honors==
Gross, Zagier, and [[Dorian M. Goldfeld]] won the [[Cole Prize]] of the [[American Mathematical Society]] in 1987 for their work on the [[Gross–Zagier theorem]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ams.org/profession/prizes-awards/ams-prizes/cole-prize-number-theory Frank Nelson Cole Prize in Number Theory], AMS, retrieved 2010-04-21.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012 he became a fellow of the [[American Mathematical Society]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ams.org/profession/fellows-list List of Fellows of the American Mathematical Society], retrieved 2013-01-19.&lt;/ref&gt; He was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 2017&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://amphilsoc.org/members/electedApril2017|title=American Philosophical Society: Newly Elected – April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Her work focuses on [[Immanuel Kant]], [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]], and the philosophy of mind and language.&lt;ref name=dualist&gt;{{cite web |title=AN INTERVIEW WITH  BÉATRICE LONGUENESSE |url=https://philosophy.stanford.edu/apps/stanfordphilosophy/files/wysiwyg_images/Longuenesse.pdf |archive-url=https://swap.stanford.edu/20141110192248/http://philosophy.stanford.edu/apps/stanfordphilosophy/files/wysiwyg_images/Longuenesse.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=10 November 2014 |publisher=The Dualist |accessdate=21 May 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated1/&gt; She is a fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated1/&gt; Longuenesse is one of the most prominent living Kant scholars, and her works have generated significant discussion around parts of Kant's corpus that were previously largely overlooked.&lt;ref name=overlooked&gt;{{cite journal|last=Janiak|first=Andrew|title=The Kantian spirit: how to resist realism in the philosophy of science|journal=Metascience|date=27 October 2010|volume=20|issue=1|pages=153–157|doi=10.1007/s11016-010-9469-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education and career==
She studied at the Ecole Normale Supérieure (Paris), the University of Paris Sorbonne, and (as a visiting student) at Princeton University.  She received her PhD ("doctorat de troisième cycle") in 1981and her Doctorat d'Etat in 1992 from the Sorbonne.  She taught at [[University of Paris|la Sorbonne]] (1978–79), the [[École Normale Supérieure]] (1980-82), the [[University of Franche-Comté|Université de Franche-Comté]] (1983–85) and the [[University of Clermont-Ferrand|Université de Clermont-Ferrand]] (1985–93) before joining [[Princeton University]] as an Associate Professor (1993–96) then full Professor (1996-2004).  In 2004 she left Princeton for NYU.  In 2011 she was elected to the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://philosophy.fas.nyu.edu/object/beatricelonguenesse.html Béatrice Longuenesse, Faculty of Philosophy | NYU&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1979-80, Longuenesse was a Jane Eliza Procter fellow at Princeton, and from 1981-1983 she served as a research fellow in the department of music at the [[Bibliothèque nationale de France]]. In 2005 she was appointed as a fellow at NYU's Institute for the Humanities, a position she still holds. Starting in 2006 she held a fellowship at the [[Institute for Advanced Study, Berlin|Wissenschaftskolleg (Institute for Advanced Study, Berlin)]], and in 2010 she was appointed Silver Professor of Philosophy at New York University.  In 2011 she was elected to the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]]. In 2012 and 2013 she received two different [[Berlin Prize]]s from the [[American Academy in Berlin]], a Siemens fellowship and John Birkelund fellowship, respectively.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

==Philosophical work==
===Overview of books===
Longuenesse has written three books, edited two volumes, and published numerous refereed papers. Her books have been described as major contributions to Kantian and Hegelian scholarship.&lt;ref name=human&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wilson|first=R.|title=Kant on the Human Standpoint|journal=The British Journal of Aesthetics|date=1 October 2006|volume=46|issue=4|pages=433–435|doi=10.1093/aesthj/ayl027}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her first book, ''Kant and the Capacity to Judge.  Sensibility and Discursivity in the Transcendental Analytic of the Critique of Pure Reason'', focused on Kant's "Table of Judgements," arguing that it in fact formed the backbone of the rest of Kant's work.&lt;ref name=table&gt;{{cite journal|last=Westphal|first=K. R.|title=KANT AND THE CAPACITY TO JUDGE|journal=Philosophical Review|date=1 October 2000|volume=109|issue=4|pages=645–648|doi=10.1215/00318108-109-4-645}}&lt;!--|accessdate=21 May 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Her second book, ''Kant on the Human Standpoint'', began by attempting to rebut some of the critiques of her first book, and went on to analyze other aspects of Kant's work, including his views on freedom, reason, and causality.&lt;ref name=human/&gt;  Her third book, ''Hegel's Critique of Metaphysics'', starts by providing a [[close reading]] of some of Hegel's works that have traditionally been considered difficult to analyze, and goes on to make an argument that Hegel's work represents a novel reworking of Kant's ideas, and that the Hegelian corpus could be used as a base upon which to build a plausible alternative to [[John Locke|Lockean]] empiricism.&lt;ref name=schlitt&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schlitt|first=Dale M.|title=LONGUENESS, BWatrice.

=== Kant's critical philosophy ===
Longuenesse is well known for her work on Kant's theory of judgment, which, she argues, provides the crucial backbone for central arguments in Kant's critical system.  Her first Kant book was originally published in French (Kant et le Pouvoir de Juger),&lt;ref&gt;{{ISBN|2 13 045607 3}}&lt;/ref&gt;  then translated into English in a revised and expanded version (Kant and the Capacity to Judge).&lt;ref&gt;{{ISBN|978-0-691-04348-7}}, 2nd edition {{ISBN|0-691-07451-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  The book was broadly discussed &lt;ref&gt;Reviews and discussion essays include (selection): Journal of Philosophy 94 (6):318-324 (1997); Philosophical Review 109 (4): 645-648 (2000); Inquiry 43 (1): 67-110; Kantian Review, Volume 5 / March 2001; Journal of the History of Philosophy, Volume 37, Number 2, April 1999; International Studies in Philosophy 35 (4):341-342; The Review of Metaphysics 52 (3):699-701; Archiv für Geschichte der Philosophie 83 (2):199-212; Journal of the History of Philosophy 37 (2):372-374.

Stefanie Grüne, Blinde Anschauung (2009), {{ISBN|3465036344}}, passim.&lt;/ref&gt;   Longuenesse's work connects Kant's view to contemporary debates in philosophy of mind, for instance around the question of the conceptual or non-conceptual content of perception and the nature of rule following.&lt;ref&gt;Stefanie Grüne, Blinde Anschauung, {{ISBN|3465036344}}, passim. Hannah Ginsborg's The Normativity of Nature (2014), {{ISBN|978-0-19-954798-2}}, passim.&lt;/ref&gt;  Longuenesse's responses to the discussions elicited by her book have appeared in numerous articles, some of which were included in her second Kant book, Kant on the Human Standpoint (2005).&lt;ref&gt;{{ISBN|978-0-521-83478-0}} hardback; 2nd edition {{ISBN|978-0-521-11218-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;   This book expands her interpretation of Kant's theory of judgment to consideration of its role in Kant's philosophy of nature, moral philosophy and aesthetic theory.

=== Hegel's ''Science of Logic'' ===
Before beginning her systematic work on Kant, Longuenesse wrote and published on Hegel.  In Hegel et la Critique de la Métaphysique,&lt;ref&gt;Hegel et la Critique de la Métaphysique, Paris :  Librairie Philosophique Vrin, 1981  Revised English version, Hegel's Critique of Metaphysics, Cambridge University Press 2007, {{ISBN|0521844665}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  she argued that Hegel's ''[[Science of Logic]]'' should be read as a radicalization of Kant's transcendental logic.   For Hegel just as for Kant, the categories of traditional metaphysics are universal forms of thinking rather than representations of intrinsic properties of things supposed to be independent of the activity of thinking.   Contra Kant, however, Hegel argues that this characterization of the categories of metaphysics does not entail that we have no knowledge of things as they are in themselves.  In more recent articles, some of which are gathered in the English version of her Hegel book,&lt;ref&gt;{{ISBN|0521844665}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Longuenesse further explores the differences between Hegel's and Kant's respective views of the nature of concepts, judgments, and inferences.  She lays out the consequences of those views for an assessment of the possibility and limits of metaphysics.

=== Philosophy of mind and self-consciousness ===

Longuenesse's recent work has expanded beyond the history of modern philosophy into contemporary philosophy of mind and language, in connection with psychology and neuroscience.  Her work focuses on the nature of self-consciousness and its relation to the use of the first person pronoun in language and in thought.  She argues that our uses of 'I' depend on two fundamental kinds of self-consciousness: consciousness of oneself as engaged in a mental activity apt to generate and assess reasons for our beliefs and actions; and consciousness of oneself as an embodied entity.   An important aspect of Kant's legacy, she claims, is to have clearly distinguished these two kinds of self-consciousness and taken the first to be fundamental to any use of 'I'.  She draws on resources from both the "analytic" and the "continental" traditions of philosophy to offer an original contribution to contemporary debates on self-consciousness.  Her work in this area has appeared in interdisciplinary venues alongside that of linguists, philosophers of language,&lt;ref&gt;Simon Prosser and François Recanati (eds.), Immunity to Error through Misidentification: New Essays, Cambridge University Press, 2012, {{ISBN|9780521198301}}.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3037">'''Carveth Read''' (1848&amp;ndash;1931) was a 19th and 20th century [[United Kingdom|British]] philosopher and logician.

==Life==
He was born 16 March 1848 in Falmouth, Cornwall, England.&lt;ref&gt;Nature 128, 1067–1067 (26 December 1931) – doi:10.1038/1281067a0&lt;/ref&gt; He was the third son of Edward Read and Elizabeth Truscott.&lt;ref&gt;''Cambridge Alumni Database'' (''CAD''), University of Cambridge (http://venn.lib.cam.ac.uk/)&lt;/ref&gt;  He attended the University of Cambridge (Christ's College).&lt;ref&gt;C.

He was the Hilbert travelling scholar, studying at Leipzig and Heidelberg Universities in 1874-1877.  In 1877 he married Evelyn Thompson.&lt;ref&gt;''CAD''.&lt;/ref&gt;  From 1878 he lectured at Wren's 'Coaching' establishment (located at 7 Powis Square, Westbourne Park, London).&lt;ref&gt;Warwick, Andrew.  ''Masters of Theory: Cambridge and the Rise of Mathematical Physics'', Chicago: University of Chicago Press (2003), p. 93.&lt;/ref&gt; He was [[Grote Chair of the Philosophy of Mind and Logic|Grote professor of philosophy of mind and logic]] &lt;ref&gt;Spearman (July 1932).&lt;/ref&gt; at the [[University College London]] (UCL) from 1903 to 1911.  From 1911 to 1921 he was Lecturer in Comparative Psychology at UCL.&lt;ref&gt;Spearman (July 1932).&lt;/ref&gt; He died 6 December 1931 in Solihull, Warwickshire, England.&lt;ref&gt;Nature 128, 1067–1067.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Work==
In the preface to the fourth edition of his book ''Logic: Deductive and Inductive'' (1920), he identifies his significant influences.  He states, "the work may be considered, on the whole, as attached to the school of Mill; to whose System of Logic, and to Bain's Logic, it is deeply indebted. Amongst the works of living writers, the Empirical Logic of Venn and the Formal Logic of Keynes have given me most assistance."&lt;ref&gt;C. Read, "Logic: Deductive and Inductive," London: Simkin, Marshall (1920), p. vi.&lt;/ref&gt;  In Chapter 22 of Logic, Read says: "It is better to be vaguely right than exactly wrong", the original source of the much quoted aphorism "It is better to be roughly right than exactly wrong" that is often incorrectly attributed to John Maynard Keynes.

Although many other monastic codes aimed at the Zen school would follow, ''Chanyuan qinggui'' is the oldest extant work of its kind. Prior to the ''Rules of Purity'', various translations of Indian [[Vinaya]] texts had existed in China since the fifth century, while Chinese monks beginning with [[Daoan]] has created [[Sangha (Buddhism)|sangha]] regulations in the 4th century. However, none was extensive or geared towards any particular sect that existed at that time. Both types of regulations has a direct influence on ''Chanyuan qinggui'', but neither aimed to be nearly as extensive or authoritative. The text regulates nearly all aspects of daily life in a monastery, from the proper protocol for ceremonies to the correct way to visit the toilet. The text became the standard reference for its topic not only in [[Song Dynasty]] China, but also well into the [[Yuan Dynasty]], as well as abroad in Korea and Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Yifa|year=2002|title=The origins of Buddhist monastic codes in China: an annotated translation and study of the Chanyuan qinggui|isbn=0824824946|publisher=University of Hawaii Press|place=Honolulu|page=xix-xxii}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Chaos magic}}'''Chaos magic''', also spelled '''chaos magick''', is a contemporary [[Magick (paranormal)#Modern_Western_occultism|magical practice]]. It was initially developed in [[England]] in the 1970s, drawing heavily from the philosophy of [[artist]] and [[occultist]] [[Austin Osman Spare]].&lt;ref name=Chryssides&gt;{{cite book |last=Chryssides |first=George D. |author-link=George Chryssides |title=Historical Dictionary of New Religious Movements |url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=WA12nHRtmAwC&amp;pg=PA78 |year=2012 |publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield |edition=2 |page=78 |isbn=978-0-8108-6194-7 |ref=refChryssides}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes referred to as "success magic" or "results-based magic", chaos magic claims to emphasize the attainment of specific results over the [[symbol]]ic, [[Ritual|ritualistic]], [[Theology|theological]] or otherwise ornamental aspects of other occult traditions.&lt;ref name=Drury&gt;{{cite book |title=The Watkins Dictionary of Magic: Over 3000 Entries on the World of Magical Formulas, Secret Symbols and the Occult |last=Drury |first=Nevill |author-link=Nevill Drury |publisher=Duncan Baird Publishers| year=2011 |orig-year=2002 |isbn=9781780283623 |url = https://books.google.ca/books?id=Bmg8CgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT96 |page=86 |ref = refDrury}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chaos magic has been described as a union of traditional occult techniques and applied [[postmodernism]]&lt;ref name=Clarke&gt;{{cite book |title=Encyclopedia of New Religious Movements |last=Clarke |first=Peter |year=2004 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=DouBAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA105 |publisher=Routledge  |pages=105–106 |isbn=9781134499700 |ref = refClarke}}&lt;/ref&gt; – particularly a postmodernist skepticism concerning the existence or [[Epistemology|knowability]] of objective truth.&lt;ref name=Urban/&gt; Chaos magicians subsequently treat belief as a tool, often creating their own idiosyncratic magical systems and frequently borrowing from other [[Magick (paranormal)#20th century|magical traditions]], [[religious movements]], [[popular culture]] and various strands of [[philosophy]].&lt;ref name=Clarke/&gt; 

Early leading figures include [[Peter J. Carroll]] and [[Ray Sherwin]].&lt;ref name=Drury/&gt;

==Concept and terminology==

Chaos magic differs from other occult traditions such as [[Thelema]] or [[Wicca]] in that it rejects the existence of absolute truth, and views all occult systems as arbitrary symbol-systems that are only effective because of the ''belief'' of the practitioner.&lt;ref name=Urban/&gt;&lt;ref name=Carroll2&gt;{{cite book | title = Liber Null &amp; Psychonaut| author = Carroll, Peter J. | publisher = Weiser Books| year = 1987| isbn = 9781609255299| url = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=oHY_FdJD6kkC| ref = refCarroll2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chaos magic thus takes an explicitly agnostic position on whether or not magic exists as a supernatural force, with many chaos magicians expressing their acceptance of a psychological model as one possible explanation.&lt;ref name=Carroll2/&gt;&lt;ref name=Hine2&gt;{{cite book | title = Prime Chaos: Adventures in Chaos Magic| author = Hine, Phil | publisher = New Falcon Publications| year = 1998| isbn = 9781609255299| url = https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/Prime_Chaos.html?id=jRfJAAAACAAJ| ref = refHine2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is unknown when the term "chaos magic" first emerged, with the earliest texts on the subject referring only to "magic" or "the magical art" in general. Furthermore, they often claimed to state principles universal to magic, as opposed to a new specific style or tradition, describing their innovations as efforts to rid magic of superstitious and religious ideas.&lt;ref name=Carroll2/&gt;{{page needed|date=July 2018}}
&lt;ref name=Sherwin1&gt;{{cite book | title = The Book of Results| author = Sherwin, Ray| publisher = Revelations 23 Press| year = 1992| isbn = 9781874171003| url = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=zmIiMQAACAAJ| ref = refSherwin1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The word ''chaos'' was first used in connection with magic by Peter J. Carroll in ''Liber Null &amp; Psychonaut'' (1978), where it is described as "the 'thing' responsible for the origin and continued action of events."&lt;ref name=Carroll2/&gt; Carroll goes on to say that "It could as well be called '[[God]]' or '[[Tao]]', but the name 'Chaos' is virtually meaningless and free from the [[anthropomorphic]] ideas of [[religion]]."&lt;ref name=Carroll2/&gt;

[[File:ChaosStar.svg|thumb|The Sigil of Chaos, a commonly used symbol of chaos magic]]

=== Results-based magic ===

Other magical traditions like [[Wicca]], [[Qabalah]] or the [[Hermetic_Order_of_the_Golden_Dawn|Golden Dawn system]] combine techniques for bringing about change with "beliefs, attitudes, a conceptual model of the universe (if not several), a moral ethic, and a few other things besides."&lt;ref name=Hine1&gt;{{cite book | title = Condensed Chaos: An Introduction to Chaos Magic| author = Hine, Phil | publisher = Original Falcon Press| year = 2009| isbn = 9781935150664| url = https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/Condensed_Chaos.html?id=_eKuSQAACAAJ| ref = refHine1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chaos magic grew out of the desire to strip away all of these extraneous elements, leaving behind only the techniques for effecting change; hence the emphasis is on actually ''doing'' things – i.e., experimenting with different techniques, rather than memorising complex rules, symbols and correspondences – and then retaining those techniques that appear to produce results.&lt;ref name=Hine1/&gt;&lt;ref name=White1&gt;{{cite book | title = Pieces of Eight: Chaos Magic Essays and Enchantments| author = White, Gordon | year = 2016| ref = refWhite1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This "pick'n'mix/D.I.Y" approach means that the working practices of different chaos magicians often look drastically different, with many authors explicitly encouraging readers to invent their own magical style.&lt;ref name=Hine2&gt;{{cite book | title = Prime Chaos: Adventures in Chaos Magic| author = Hine, Phil | publisher = New Falcon Publications| year = 1998| isbn = 9781609255299| url = https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/Prime_Chaos.html?id=jRfJAAAACAAJ| ref = refHine2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Fries1&gt;{{cite book | title = Seidways| author = Fries, Jan | publisher = Mandrake of Oxford| year = 1997| isbn = 1-869928-36-9| ref = refFries1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Hawkins1&gt;{{cite book | title = Understanding Chaos Magic| author = Hawkins, Jaq D.| publisher = Capall Bann Publishing| year = 1996| isbn = 1-898307-93-8| ref = refHawkins1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Belief as a tool ===

The central defining tenet of chaos magic is arguably the "meta-belief" that "belief is a tool for achieving effects".&lt;ref name=Carroll1&gt;{{cite book | title = Liber Kaos| author = Carroll, Peter J. | publisher = Weiser Books| year = 1992| isbn = 9780877287421| url = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=M_GRhTdT4YgC| ref = refCarroll1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In chaos magic, complex symbol systems like [[Qabalah]], the [[Enochian|Enochian system]], [[astrology]] or the [[I Ching]] are treated as maps or "symbolic and linguistic constructs" that can be manipulated to achieve certain ends but that have no [[Universality_(philosophy)|absolute]] or [[Objectivity_(philosophy)|objective truth]] value in themselves&lt;ref name=Hine1/&gt; – a position referred to by religious scholar [[Hugh Urban]] as a "rejection of all fixed models of reality",&lt;ref name=Urban&gt;{{cite book |last=Urban |first=Hugh |author-link=Hugh Urban |year=2006 |title=Magia Sexualis: Sex, Magic, and Liberation in Modern Western Esotericism |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=6wVBx9yriTUC&amp;pg=PA240 |publisher=University of California Press |pages=240–243 |isbn=9780520932883 |ref=refUrban}}&lt;/ref&gt; and often summarised with the phrase "nothing is true everything is permitted".&lt;ref name=Carr-Gomm&gt;{{cite book | title = The Book of English Magic| author1 = Carr-Gomm, Philip | author2 = Heygate, Richard | publisher = The Overlook Press| year = 2010| isbn = 9781590207604| url = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=FXUjCQAAQBAJ| ref = refCarr-Gomm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Carroll1/&gt;

Some commentators have traced this position to the influence of [[postmodernism]] on contemporary occultism.&lt;ref name=Urban/&gt;&lt;ref name=Carr-Gomm/&gt; Another influence comes from the magical system of [[Austin Osman Spare]], who believed that belief itself was a form of [[Energy_(psychological)|"psychic energy"]] that became locked up in rigid belief structures, and that could be released by breaking down those structures. This "free belief" could then be directed towards new aims.&lt;ref name=Spare1&gt;{{cite book | title = The Book of Pleasure: The Psychology of Ecstasy| author = Spare, Austin Osman | publisher = Lulu Press| year = 2013| isbn = 9781105502996| url = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=F7lLCAAAQBAJ| ref = refSpare1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other writers&lt;ref name=Morrison&gt;{{cite book | title = Book of Lies: The Disinformation Guide to Magick and the Occult| author = Morrison, Grant| chapter = Pop Magic!| publisher = Red Wheel Weiser| year = 2003| editor = Metzger, Richard| isbn = 9780971394278| url = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=1zMENGdUSoEC| ref = refMorrison}}&lt;/ref&gt; have highlighted the influence of occultist [[Aleister Crowley]], who wrote of the occult:

&lt;blockquote&gt;In this book it is spoken of the Sephiroth and the Paths; of Spirits and Conjurations; of Gods, Spheres, Planes, and many other things which may or may not exist. It is immaterial whether these exist or not. By doing certain things certain results will follow; students are most earnestly warned against attributing objective reality or philosophic validity to any of them.&lt;ref name=Crowley1&gt;{{cite book | title = Book 4| author = Crowley, Aleister | publisher = Weiser Books| year = 1980| isbn = 9780877285137| url = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=_Q69RL7mJv0C| ref = refCrowley1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Kia and Chaos ===

Within the magical system of [[Austin Osman Spare]], magic was thought to operate by using symbols to communicate ''desire'' to something Spare termed [[Kia_(magic)|"Kia"]] (a sort of universal mind, of which individual human consciousnesses are aspects) via the "passage" of the unconscious – hence the need for complex systems of symbolism. Provided there was enough "free belief" to feed them, these desires would then grow, unconsciously, into "obsessions", which would culminate in magical results occurring in reality.&lt;ref name=Spare1/&gt;&lt;ref name=Baker&gt;{{cite book | title = Austin Osman Spare: The Life and Legend of London's Lost Artist| author = Baker, Phil| publisher = Strange Attractor| year = 2011| isbn = 9781907222016| url = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=rQu4twAACAAJ| ref = refBaker}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Peter J. Carroll inherited this model from Spare, but used the term "Kia" to refer to the consciousness of the individual: "the elusive 'I' which confers self-awareness".&lt;ref name=Carroll2/&gt; The more general universal force, of which Kia is an aspect, Carroll termed "Chaos". In his own words:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Chaos... is the force which has caused life to evolve itself out of dust, and is currently most concentratedly manifest in the human life force, or Kia, where it is the source of consciousness... To the extent that the Kia can become one with Chaos it can extend its will and perception into the universe to accomplish magic.&lt;ref name=Carroll2/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Later chaos magicians have stressed that this basic operating process can be explained in multiple different ways, from within different paradigms. For example:

* Within a spirit model, the job of a [[shaman]] is to communicate their intentions to their spirit helpers, who then work magic on their behalf. 
* Within an energy model, a magician might direct their own [[qi|qi/ch'i]] towards specific aims.
* Within a psychological model, a magician uses symbols to condition their unconscious to work towards their goals.
* Within an information model, a magician transmits information to an underlying matrix or field in order to produce specific effects.&lt;ref name=Hine1/&gt;&lt;ref name=UD&gt;{{cite web |url = https://www.chaosmatrix.org/library/chaos/texts/model.html|title = Models of Magic|author = Frater U.'.D.'.|date = 1991|website = Chaos Matrix|access-date = June 6, 2018| ref = refUD}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Practices ==

Since chaos magic is built around an experimental, D.I.Y. approach that involves stripping all magical techniques down to their barest essence, any practice from any magical tradition can be incorporated under the banner of chaos magic: from [[satanism|Satanic]] ritual, to [[wicca|Wiccan]] [[sabbats]], to [[energy healing]], to [[tantra|Tantric practices]], etc. However, there are a few techniques that have been specifically developed by chaos magicians, and are unique to the tradition.

=== Gnostic state ===

Most chaos magic techniques involve something called the gnostic state, or [[gnosis_(chaos_magic)|gnosis]]. This is described as an [[altered state of consciousness]] in which a person's mind is focused on [[Samadhi|only one point]], thought, or goal and all other thoughts are thrust out.&lt;ref name=Hine2/&gt; The gnostic state is used to bypass the "filter" of the conscious mind – something thought to be necessary for working most forms of magic.&lt;ref name=Carroll2/&gt;

Since it takes years of training to master this sort of Zen-like meditative ability, chaos magicians employ a variety of other ways to attain a "brief 'no-mind' state" in which to work magic.&lt;ref name=Morrison/&gt; Three main types of gnosis are described:&lt;ref name=Vitimus&gt;{{cite book |last=Vitimus |first=Andrieh |title=Hands-on Chaos Magic: Reality Manipulation Through the Ovayki Current |publisher=Llewellyn Worldwide |year=2009 |isbn=978-0-7387-1508-7| ref = refVitimus}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''[[Inhibitory gnosis]]''' is a form of deep [[meditation]] into a [[trance]] state of [[mind]]. This type of [[gnosis_(chaos_magic)|gnosis]] uses slow and regular [[breath]]ing techniques, absent thought processes, [[progressive muscle relaxation]], self-induction and [[self-hypnosis]] techniques. Means employed may also include [[fasting]], [[sleeplessness]], [[sensory deprivation]] and [[hypnotic]] or trance-inducing drugs.

* '''Ecstatic gnosis''' describes a mindlessness reached through intense [[arousal]]. It is aimed to be reached through [[sexual arousal|sexual excitation]], intense [[emotion]]s, [[flagellation]], [[dance]], [[drum]]ming, [[chanting]], [[sensory overload]], [[hyperventilation]] and the use of disinhibitory or hallucinogenic drugs.

* '''Indifferent vacuity''' was described by [[Phil Hine]] and [[Jan Fries]] as a third method. Here the intended spell is cast parenthetically, so it does not raise much thought to suppress – "doodling sigils while listening to a talk which is boring, but you have to take notes on", for example.&lt;ref name=Fries2&gt;{{cite book|title=Visual Magick: A Handbook of Freestyle Shamanism |first=Jan |last=Fries |authorlink=Jan Fries |publisher=[[Mandrake of Oxford]] |year=1992 |isbn=1-869928-57-1| ref = refFries2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Hine2/&gt;

=== Sigils ===

[[File:Sigil shoal.svg|thumb|A shoal of [[sigil_(magic)|sigils]]]]


A [[Sigil_(magic)|sigil]] is a picture or glyph that represents a particular desire or intention. They are most commonly created by writing out the intention, then condensing the letters of the statement down to form a sort of [[monogram]]. The chaos magician then uses the gnostic state to "launch" or "charge" the sigil – essentially bypassing the conscious mind to implant the desire in the unconscious.&lt;ref name=Sherwin1/&gt;&lt;ref name=Morrison/&gt; To quote Ray Sherwin:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The magician acknowledges a desire, he lists the appropriate symbols and arranges them into an easily visualised glyph. Using any of the gnostic techniques he reifies the sigil and then, by force of will, hurls it into his subconscious from where the sigil can begin to work unencumbered by desire.&lt;ref name=Sherwin1/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

After charging the sigil, it is considered necessary to repress all memory of it: there should be "a deliberate striving to forget it", in Spare's words.&lt;ref name=Spare1/&gt;

In the [[Medieval era]], a ''sigil'' was a symbol associated with a particular [[angel]] or [[demon]], which could be used to ritually summon the relevant being.&lt;ref name=Weschcke&gt;{{cite book|title=The Llewellyn Complete Book of Psychic Empowerment: A Compendium of Tools &amp; Techniques for Growth &amp; Transformation |author1=Weschcke, Carl Llewellyn|author2=Slate, Joe H. |publisher=Llewellyn Worldwide|year=2011 |isbn=9780738729862|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=OzIvEjvCj1sC|ref = refWeschcke}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spare turned this practice on its head, arguing that such supernatural beings were simply [[Complex_(psychology)|complexes]] in the unconscious, and could be actively created through the process of sigilisation.&lt;ref name=Spare1/&gt;&lt;ref name=Baker/&gt; In modern chaos magic, when a complex of thoughts, desires and intentions gains such a level of sophistication that it appears to operate autonomously from the magician's consciousness, as if it were an independent being, then such a complex is referred to as a [[servitor (chaos magic)|servitor]].&lt;ref name=Hine2/&gt;&lt;ref name=Marik2&gt;{{cite web |url = https://www.chaosmatrix.org/library/chaos/texts/servitors.html|title = Servitors: Part Two of Sigils, Servitors, and Godforms|author = Marik|date = 1998|website = Chaos Matrix|access-date = June 7, 2018| ref = refMarik2}}&lt;/ref&gt; When such a being becomes large enough that it exists independently of any one individual, as a form of "group mind", then it is referred to as an [[egregore]].&lt;ref name=Rysen&gt;{{cite web |url = https://www.chaosmatrix.org/library/chaos/texts/fen-egre.html|title = The Fluid Continuum --or-- What the f***'s an Egregore?|author = Rysen, Fenwick |date = 1999|website = Chaos Matrix|access-date = June 7, 2018| ref = refRysen}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Emerson&gt;{{cite web |url = https://www.chaosmatrix.org/library/chaos/texts/gegregor.html|title = Egregore Definition Compilation|author = Emerson, Gabriel|date = 1997|website = Chaos Matrix|access-date = June 7, 2018| ref = refEmerson}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later chaos magicians have expanded on the basic sigilisation technique. [[Grant Morrison]] coined the term ''hypersigil'' to refer to an extended work of art with magical meaning and willpower, created using adapted processes of sigilization. His [[comic book]] series ''[[The Invisibles]]'' was intended as such a hypersigil.&lt;ref name=Morrison/&gt; Morrison has also argued that modern [[Logo|corporate logos]] like "the McDonald's Golden Arches, the Nike swoosh and the Virgin autograph" are a form of viral sigil:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Corporate sigils are super-breeders. They attack unbranded imaginative space. They invade Red Square, they infest the cranky streets of Tibet, they etch themselves into hairstyles. They breed across clothing, turning people into advertising hoardings... The logo or brand, like any sigil, is a condensation, a compressed, symbolic summoning up of the world of desire which the corporation intends to represent... Walt Disney died long ago but his sigil, that familiar, cartoonish signature, persists, carrying its own vast weight of meanings, associations, nostalgia and significance.&lt;ref name=Morrison/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Gordon White developed the technique of ''shoaling'', which involves launching a group of sigils for a set of related aims. For example, instead of sigilising for "money", sigilising for a pay rise, new business clients, a promotion, influential new contacts, budget reallocation for your department, etc. – all of which help "shift the probability" towards the overall aim.&lt;ref name=White4&gt;{{cite web |url = https://runesoup.com/2012/03/ultimate-sigil-magic-guide/|title = Sigils Reboot: How to get Big Magic from Little Squiggles|author = White, Gordon|date = 2012|website = Rune Soup|access-date = June 7, 2018| ref = refWhite4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=White2&gt;{{cite web |url = https://runesoup.com/2010/06/shoaling-making-sigil-magic-more-awesome-since-2010/|title = Shoaling: Making Sigil Magic more Awesome Since 2010|author = White, Gordon|date = 2010|website = Rune Soup|access-date = June 7, 2018| ref = refWhite2}}&lt;/ref&gt; White also developed the technique of the ''robofish'', which consists of including a sigil for something that the chaos magician knows will definitely happen, to "lead" the rest of the shoal.&lt;ref name=White3&gt;{{cite web |url = https://runesoup.com/2011/07/magic-secrets-as-taught-by-robot-fish/|title = Magic Secrets as Taught by Robot Fish|author = White, Gordon|date = 2012|website = Rune Soup|access-date = June 7, 2018| ref = refWhite3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cut-up technique ===

The cut-up technique is an [[aleatory]] [[literary technique]] in which a written text is cut up and rearranged, often at random, to create a new text. The technique can also be applied to other media: film, photography, audio recordings, etc. It was pioneered by [[Brion Gysin]] and [[William S. Burroughs]].&lt;ref name=Cran&gt;{{cite book|title= Collage in Twentieth-Century Art, Literature, and Culture: Joseph Cornell, William Burroughs, Frank O’Hara, and Bob Dylan|author= Cran, Rona|publisher= Routledge|year= 2016|isbn= 9781317164296|url= https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=oFU3DAAAQBAJ|ref = refCran}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Burroughs – who practiced chaos magic, and was inducted into the chaos magic organisation [[Illuminates_of_Thanateros|The Illuminates of Thanateros]] in the early 1990s&lt;ref name=Stevens&gt;{{cite web |url = http://realitysandwich.com/172802/magical_universe_william_s_burroughs/|title = The Magical Universe of William S. Burroughs|author = Stevens, Matthew Levi|date = 2013|website = Reality Sandwich|access-date = June 8, 2018| ref = refStevens}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=GrantD&gt;{{cite web |url = http://ashejournal.com/2015/03/16/magick-and-photography/|title = Magick and Photography|author = Grant, Douglas|date = 2015|website = Ashe Journal|access-date = June 8, 2018| ref = refGrantD}}&lt;/ref&gt; – was adamant that the technique had a magical function, stating "the cut ups are not for artistic purposes".&lt;ref name=Harris&gt;{{cite book | title = The Cambridge Companion to the Beats| author = Harris, Oliver| chapter = William S. Burroughs: Beating Postmodernism| publisher = Cambridge University Press| year = 2017| editor = Belletto, Steven | isbn = 9781107184459| url = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=NYXuDQAAQBAJ| ref = refHarris}}&lt;/ref&gt; Burroughs used his cut-ups for "political warfare, scientific research, personal therapy, magical divination, and conjuration"&lt;ref name=Harris/&gt; – the essential idea being that the cut-ups allowed the user to "break down the barriers that surround consciousness".&lt;ref name=Burroughs&gt;{{cite book | title = The Job: Interviews with William S. Burroughs| author = Burroughs, William S.| publisher = Penguin UK| year = 2012| isbn = 9780141903583| url = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=DivGjW-qEv8C| ref = refBurroughs}}&lt;/ref&gt; As Burroughs himself stated:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I would say that my most interesting experience with the earlier techniques was the realization that when you make cut-ups you do not get simply random juxtapositions of words, that they do mean something, and often that these meanings refer to some future event. I've made many cut-ups and then later recognized that the cut-up referred to something that I read later in a newspaper or a book, or something that happened... Perhaps events are pre-written and pre-recorded and when you cut word lines the future leaks out.&lt;ref name=Burroughs/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[David Bowie]] compared the randomness of the cut-up technique to the randomness inherent in traditional divinatory systems, like the [[I Ching]] or [[Tarot]].&lt;ref name=Doggett&gt;{{cite book | title = The Man who Sold the World: David Bowie and the 1970s| author = Doggett, Peter| publisher = Random House| year = 2011| isbn = 9781847921451| url = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=KC5yOXoyXioC| ref = refDoggett}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other chaos magicians have elaborated on the basic technique. [[Genesis P-Orridge]], who studied under Burroughs, describes it as a way to "identify and short circuit control, life being a stream of cut-ups on every level. They are a means to describe and reveal reality and the multi-faceted individual in which/from which reality is generated."&lt;ref name=P-Orridge&gt;{{cite book | title = THEE PSYCHICK BIBLE: Thee Apocryphal Scriptures ov Genesis Breyer P-Orridge and Thee Third Mind ov Thee Temple ov Psychick Youth| author = P-Orridge, Genesis Breyer| publisher = Feral House| year = 2010| isbn = 9781932595949| url = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=X1FjCwAAQBAJ| ref = refP-Orridge}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dave_Lee_(chaos_magician)|Dave Lee]] suggested various magical ways to use the cut-up technique, such as cutting together two people to form a love spell.&lt;ref name=Lee&gt;{{cite web |url = https://chaotopia.co.uk/cutupcoll.html|title = Cut Up and Collage in Magic|author = Lee, Dave|date = 1989|website = Chaotopia!|access-date = June 8, 2018| ref = refLee}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Synchromysticism ===

[[Synchromysticism]], a [[portmanteau]] of [[synchronicity]] and [[mysticism]], is "the art of realising meaningful coincidences in the seemingly mundane with mystical or esoteric significance".&lt;ref name=Valis&gt;{{cite web |url = http://realitysandwich.com/1377/the_cryptic_cosmology_synchromysticism/ |title = The Cryptic Cosmology of Synchromysticism |author = Valis | date = 2008 | website = Reality Sandwich | access-date = June 14, 2018| ref = refValis}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been described as "a form of [[postmodernism|postmodern]] [[animism]]" that "combines Jung's notion of meaningful coincidences with the quest for the divine, or self-actualization through experience of the divine."&lt;ref name=Horsley&gt;{{cite book|title=The Secret Life of Movies: Schizophrenic and Shamanic Journeys in American Cinema |author= Horsley, Jason |publisher=McFarland|year=2009 |isbn= 9780786454624 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=SRDvgD-SADAC |ref = refHorsley}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the beginning, the founders of chaos magic were clear that the "results" to be attained through their techniques consisted of synchronicities, with Carroll stating in ''Liber Null &amp; Psychonaut'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;All magical paradigms partake of some form of action at a distance, be it distance in space or time or both... In magic this is called synchronicity. A mental event, perception, or an act of will occurs at the same time (synchronously) as an event in the material world... Of course, this can always be excused as coincidence, but most magicians would be quite content with being able to arrange coincidences.&lt;ref name=Carroll2/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Essentially, chaos magic consists of a set of techniques for ''deliberately engineering synchronicities''.&lt;ref name=Carroll2/&gt; As Carroll makes clear in later texts, magical "results" consist of "meaningful coincidences" or "a series of events going somewhat improbably in the desired direction."&lt;ref name=Carroll4&gt;{{cite book | title = Octavo: A Sorceror-Scientist's Grimoire (Roundworld Edition) | author = Carroll, Peter J. | publisher = Mandrake of Oxford | year = 2010 | isbn = 9781906958176 | url = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=x6UUTwEACAAJ | ref = refCarroll4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later chaos magicians have made the link between chaos magic and synchromysticism more overt. Gordon White, for example, writes in ''Synchromysticism as Kabbalah'': 

&lt;blockquote&gt;How does the Technical [[Hermetica]] ‘work’? How did [[Ficino]]’s system of planetary [[ritual magic]] ‘work’? Simply put, both work because some things are associated with other things. Symbols recur, patterns repeat, sounds heard on a radio associate with similar outcomes in your life. An Animist universe speaks a language of symbol and synchronicity. To you, to itself, to the birds. This awareness underpins systems of magical correspondence the world over – such as practical [[Kabbalah]] or Technical Hermetica... These systems are indications that the universe speaks in a symbolic language... use them in a wider synchromystic context.&lt;ref name=White1/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Elsewhere, White speculates that this may be "the secret of kabbalistic apotheosis" – "hearing the language behind the words, connecting the things that aren't connected... a mystical framework for exploring and ''encouraging'' synchronicity."&lt;ref name=White6&gt;{{cite web |url = https://runesoup.com/2013/04/twilight-language-the-quest-for-the-grail/|title = Twilight Language: The Quest for the Grail |author = White, Gordon|date = 2013|website = Rune Soup|access-date = June 14, 2018| ref = refWhite6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

=== Origins and influences (1974-1982) ===

[[File:Austin_Osman_Spare.jpg|thumb|[[Austin Osman Spare]], whose ideas formed the basis of chaos magic. Photo taken 1904.]]

Chaos magic was first developed in England in the mid-1970s, at a time when British occultism was dominated by [[Wicca]] and [[Thelema]].&lt;ref name=Hawkins1/&gt; Although both of these traditions incorporate magical elements, they are both religions, and as such contain devotional elements, [[liturgy]] and [[dogma]]. Chaos magic grew out of the desire of some occultists to strip away these extrinsic details and distill [[Magic_(paranormal)|magic]] down to a set of tried-and-tested techniques for causing effects to occur in reality.&lt;ref name=Hawkins1/&gt;&lt;ref name=Hine1/&gt; An oft quoted line from Peter Carroll is "Magic will not free itself from occultism until we have strangled the last astrologer with the guts of the last spiritual master."&lt;ref name=Carroll3&gt;{{cite book | title = Psybermagick: Advanced Ideas in Chaos Magick: Revised Edition| author = Carroll, Peter J. | publisher = Original Falcon Press| year = 2008| isbn = 9781935150657| url = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=mxLHPAAACAAJ| ref = refCarroll3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Peter J. Carroll]] and [[Ray Sherwin]] are considered to be the founders of chaos magic, although [[Phil Hine]] points out that there were others "lurking in the background, such as the ''Stoke Newington Sorcerors''"&lt;ref name=Hine1/&gt; – a group which included [[Charles Brewster]] (Frater Choronzon).&lt;ref name=IOT&gt;{{cite book| title = The Secrets of the Illuminates of Thanateros| author = IOT| publisher = The Illuminates of Thanateros| year = 2002| url = http://www.iot.org.uk/pdf/the_book_english.pdf| ref = refIOT| access-date = 2018-06-10| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20060917214610/http://www.iot.org.uk/pdf/the_book_english.pdf#| archive-date = 2006-09-17| dead-url = yes| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Carroll was a regular contributor to ''[[The New Equinox]]'', a magazine edited by Sherwin, and thus the two became acquainted.&lt;ref name=Hine1/&gt;&lt;ref name=Hawkins1/&gt;

1978 was perhaps the seminal year in the origin of chaos magic, seeing the publication of both ''Liber Null'' by Carroll and ''The Book of Results'' by Sherwin – the first published books on chaos magic – and the establishment of [[Illuminates_of_Thanateros|The Illuminates of Thanateros]] (IOT), the first chaos magic organization.&lt;ref name=IOT/&gt;

[[Austin Osman Spare]] is largely the source of chaos magical theory and practice.&lt;ref name=Carroll2/&gt;&lt;ref name=Sherwin1/&gt;&lt;ref name=Hine1/&gt;&lt;ref name=Hawkins1/&gt; Specifically, Spare developed the use of [[sigil (magic)|sigil]]s and the use of [[gnosis_(chaos_magic)|gnosis]] to empower these. Most basic sigil work recapitulates Spare's technique, including the construction of a phrase detailing the magical intent, the elimination of duplicate letters, and the artistic recombination of the remaining letters to form the sigil. Although Spare died before chaos magic emerged, many consider him to be the grandfather of chaos magic because of his repudiation of traditional magical systems in favor of a technique based on gnosis.

[[Aleister Crowley]] was a marginal yet early and ongoing influence, particularly for his [[syncretic]] approach to magic, and his emphasis on experimentation and deconditioning.&lt;ref name=Hine1/&gt; Other early influences include [[Discordianism]], the [[punk subculture|punk]] movement, [[postmodernism]] and the writings of [[Robert Anton Wilson]].&lt;ref name=Hine1/&gt; [[Lionel Snell]] was also publishing writing on Spare in the mid-1970s, and became drawn into the burgeoning chaoist movement. Snell's book ''[[SSOTBME]]'' (1974) also came to influence the early chaos magicians.&lt;ref name=Hawkins1/&gt;

However, despite these influences, it's clear from their early writings that the first chaos magicians were attempting to recover a sort of universal [[shamanism]] by stripping away any accumulated cultural gloss. Carroll makes this clear in ''Liber Null'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;When stripped of local symbolism and terminology, all systems show a remarkable uniformity of method. This is because all systems ultimately derive from the tradition of Shamanism. It is toward an elucidation of this tradition that the following chapters are devoted.&lt;ref name=Carroll2/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This is echoed in Snell's description of Spare as a "master shaman" who brought into the world a new form of "shamanistic sorcery".&lt;ref name=Snell1&gt;{{cite web |url = https://fulgur.co.uk/austin-osman-spare/exploring-spares-magic|title = Exploring Spare's Magic|author = Snell, Lionel|date = 1987|website = Fulgur|access-date = June 10, 2018| ref = refSnell1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Early development and spread (1982-1994) ===

New chaos magic groups emerged in the early 1980s – at first, located in [[Yorkshire]], where both Sherwin and Carroll were living. The early scene was focused on a shop in Leeds called ''The Sorceror's Apprentice'', owned by Chris Bray. Bray also published a magazine called ''The Lamp of Thoth'', which published articles on chaos magic, and his ''Sorceror's Apprentice Press'' re-released both ''Liber Null'' and ''The Book of Results'', as well as ''Psychonaut'' and ''The Theatre of Magic''.&lt;ref name=Hine1/&gt; ''The Circle of Chaos'', which included [[Dave_Lee_(chaos_magician)|Dave Lee]], was formed in Yorkshire in 1982.&lt;ref name=Hawkins1/&gt;&lt;ref name=Baph&gt;{{cite web |url = https://theblogofbaphomet.com/2012/12/08/an-audience-with-dave-lee/|title = An Audience with Dave Lee|author1 = Vayne, Julian|author2=Dee, Steve|author3=Wyrd, Nikki|date = 2012|website = The Blog of Baphomet|access-date = June 10, 2018| ref = refBaph}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rituals of this group were published by Paula Pagani as ''The Cardinal Rites of Chaos'' in 1985.&lt;ref name=Hine1/&gt;

[[Ralph Tegtmeier]] (Frater U.D.), who ran a bookshop in Germany and was already practicing his own brand of "ice magick", translated ''Liber Null'' into German.&lt;ref name=Hawkins2&gt;{{cite book | title = Chaonomicon| author = Hawkins, Jaq D.| publisher = Lulu| year = 2017| isbn = 9780244916633| ref = refHawkins2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tegtmeier was inducted into the IOT in the mid-1980s, and later established the German section of the order. He was excommunicated in 1990 over the "Ice Magic Wars".&lt;ref name=IOT/&gt;&lt;ref name=Hawkins2/&gt; Lola Babalon established the first American IOT temple in 1988.&lt;ref name=Hawkins2/&gt;

As chaos magic spread, people from outside Carroll and Sherwin's circle began publishing on the topic. [[Phil Hine]], who practiced chaos magic alongside [[Tantra]] and [[Wicca]], published a number of books on the subject that were particularly influential in spreading chaos magic techniques via the internet.&lt;ref name=Gyrus&gt;{{cite web |url = https://dreamflesh.com/interview/phil-hine/|title = Chaos and Beyond|author = Gyrus|date = 1997|website = Dreamflesh|access-date = June 11, 2018| ref = refGyrus}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Blackwell&gt;{{cite web |url = http://wiccanrede.org/2010/12/interview-with-phil-hine/|title = Before, Chaos, and After|author = Blackwell, Christopher|date = 2010|website = Wiccan Rede|access-date = June 11, 2018| ref = refBlackwell}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jaq D. Hawkins, from California, wrote an article on chaos magic for ''Mezlim'' magazine, coming into contact with Sherwin and other IOT members in the process. Hawkins later wrote the first chaos magic book intended for a general readership.&lt;ref name=Hawkins1/&gt;&lt;ref name=Hawkins2/&gt; In 1992, [[Jan Fries]] published ''Visual Magick'', introducing his own blend of "freestyle shamanism", which has had influence on chaos magic.&lt;ref name=Fries&gt;{{cite book | title = Visual Magick: A Practical Guide to Trance, Sigils and Visualization Techniques| author = Fries, Jan| publisher = Mandrake of Oxford| year = 2000|isbn = 9781869928575| url = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=lsfSAAAACAAJ| ref = refFries}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1981, [[Genesis P-Orridge]] established [[Thee Temple ov Psychick Youth]] (TOPY), an art collective and magical order.&lt;ref name=P-Orridge/&gt; P-Orridge had studied magic under [[William S. Burroughs]] and [[Brion Gysin]] in the 1970s, and was also influenced by Aleister Crowley and Austin Osman Spare, as well as the [[Psychedelia|psychedelic movement]].&lt;ref name=P-Orridge2&gt;{{cite book | title = Book of Lies: The Disinformation Guide to Magick and the Occult| author = P-Orridge, Genesis| chapter = Magick Squares and Future Beats| publisher = Red Wheel Weiser| year = 2003| editor = Metzger, Richard| isbn = 9780971394278| url = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=1zMENGdUSoEC| ref = refP-Orridge2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=P-Orridge/&gt; TOPY practiced chaos magic alongside their other activities, and helped raise awareness of chaos magic in subcultures like the [[Acid House]] and [[Industrial music]] scenes.&lt;ref name=P-Orridge/&gt; They were also partially responsible for introducing the techniques of Burroughs and Gysin to the chaos magic stream&lt;ref name=P-Orridge2/&gt; – but this influence also ran the other way, with Burroughs (who already practiced magic and was experimenting with Spare's sigil technique)&lt;ref name=Stevens/&gt;&lt;ref name=GrantD/&gt;&lt;ref name=P-Orridge2/&gt; being inducted into the IOT in the early 1990s.&lt;ref name=Stevens/&gt;

=== Pop culture: (1994-early 2000s) ===

From the beginning, chaos magic has had a tendency to draw on the symbolism of [[pop culture]] in addition to that of "authentic" magical systems; the rationale being that all symbol systems are equally arbitrary, and thus equally valid – the belief invested in them being the thing that matters.&lt;ref name=Morrison/&gt; The [[symbol of chaos]], for example, was lifted from the fantasy novels of [[Michael Moorcock]].&lt;ref name=Nozedar&gt;{{cite book | title = Secret Signs and Symbols: The Ultimate A-Z Guide from Alchemy to the Zodiac| author = Nozedar, Adele | publisher = HarperCollins UK| year = 2008| isbn = 9780007264452| url = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=an67pzmMJb4C | ref = refNozedar}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Preluded by [[Kenneth Grant]] – who had studied with both Crowley and Spare, and who had introduced elements of [[H._P._Lovecraft|H.P. Lovecraft's]] fictional [[Cthulhu mythos]] into his own magical writings&lt;ref name=Lavenda&gt;{{cite book | title = The Dark Lord: H.P. Lovecraft, Kenneth Grant and the Typhonian Tradition in Magic| author = Levenda, Peter | publisher = Nicolas-Hays, Inc.| year = 2013| isbn = 9780892542079| url = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=DPQ9TUaEKjMC | ref = refLavenda}}&lt;/ref&gt; – there was a trend for chaos magicians to perform rituals invoking or otherwise dealing with entities from Lovecraft's work, such as the [[Great Old Ones]]. Hine, for example, published ''The Pseudonomicon'' (1994), a book of Lovecraftian rites.&lt;ref name=Hine3&gt;{{cite book | title = The Pseudonomicon| author = Hine, Phil | publisher = New Falcon Publications| year = 2009| isbn = 9781935150640| url = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=EC5hQwAACAAJ | ref = refHine3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In turn, by the mid-1990s, chaos magic itself was beginning to leak into pop culture. Many of the writers and artists who produced strips for British [[sci-fi]] [[comic]] [[2000_AD_(comics)|2000ad]] also practiced chaos magic – among them [[Pat Mills]],&lt;ref name=Clutterbuck&gt;{{cite web |url=http://historiadiscordia.com/chaos-in-the-uk-from-the-klf-to-reclaim-the-streets/ |date=April 7, 2017 |title=Chaos in the UK: From the KLF to Reclaim the Streets |last=Clutterbuck |first=Brenton |website=Historia Discordia |access-date=June 12, 2018 |ref=refClutterbuck}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bryan Talbot]],&lt;ref name=Thorpe&gt;{{cite web |url = http://awfullybigblogadventure.blogspot.com/2014/05/comics-anarchy-chaos-magick-and-george.html|title = Comics, anarchy, chaos magick and George Orwell|author = Thorpe, David|date = 2014|website = An Awfully Big Blog Adventure|access-date = June 12, 2018| ref = refThorpe}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tony Skinner]],&lt;ref name=Molcher&gt;{{cite book | title = 2000 AD: The Creator Interviews - Volume 01| author = Molcher, Michael | publisher = 2000 AD Books| year = 2015| isbn = 9781849973236| url = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=eb7XAAAAQBAJ | ref = refMolcher}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Dave Thorpe]]&lt;ref name=Thorpe/&gt; – and many included frequent references to chaos magic in their work. Mills, for example, created the characters of [[Nemesis the Warlock]] and [[ABC_Warriors#Deadlock|Deadlock]], both of whom practiced "khaos magick".&lt;ref name=talkingcomicssite&gt;{{cite web |url = https://talkingcomicssite.wordpress.com/2017/08/20/nemesis-and-deadlock-a-magickal-partnership/|title = Nemesis and Deadlock: A Magickal Partnership|author = talkingcomicssite|date = 2017|website = talkingcomicssite|access-date = June 12, 2018| ref = reftalkingcomicssite}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Grant Morrison]], who began practicing chaos magic at 19,&lt;ref name=Babcock&gt;{{cite web |url = https://arthurmag.com/2007/02/01/interview-with-grant-morrison-from-the-pages-of-arthur-magazine/|title = One Nervous System’s Passage Through Time|author = Babcock, Jay|date = 2004|website = Arthur|access-date = June 12, 2018| ref = refBabcock}}&lt;/ref&gt; wrote the series [[Zenith_(comics)|''Zenith'']] for 2000ad. ''Zenith'' frequently featured chaos magic themes, as well as a distinct Lovecraftian influence, and the [[Cthulhu mythos]]-inspired monsters of the story were copied straight from the illustrations of ''Liber Null''&lt;ref name=Sarkos&gt;{{cite web |url = https://sarkos.tumblr.com/post/71301152131/just-random-info-the-old-ones-and-the-mysterious|title = The Old Ones and the mysterious Brian Ward|author = Sarkos|date = 2013|website = Hate:Wreck:Peril|access-date = June 12, 2018| ref = refSarkos}}&lt;/ref&gt; – leading to the threat of a lawsuit from Peter Carroll.&lt;ref name=Clutterbuck/&gt;

From 1994 to 2000, Morrison wrote ''[[The Invisibles]]'' for [[DC_Comics|DC Comics']] [[Vertigo_(DC_Comics)|Vertigo]] imprint, which has been described by Morrison as a "hypersigil": "a dynamic miniature model of the magician's universe, a hologram, microcosm or 'voodoo doll' which can be manipulated in real time to produce changes in the macrocosmic environment of 'real' life."&lt;ref name=Morrison/&gt; Both ''The Invisibles'' and the activities of Morrison himself were responsible for bringing chaos magic to a much wider audience in the late 1990s and early 2000s, with the writer outlining his views on chaos magic in the "Pop Magic!" chapter of ''A Book of Lies'' (2003)&lt;ref name=Morrison/&gt; a [[Disinformation_(company)|Disinfo Convention]] talk,&lt;ref name=Metzger2&gt;{{cite book | title = Disinformation: The Interviews: Uncut &amp; Uncensored| author = Metzger, Richard | publisher = Red Wheel Weiser| year = 2002| isbn = 9781609259365| url = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=SdpAB7sbkZwC | ref = refMetzger2}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the documentary ''[[Grant Morrison: Talking with Gods]]''.&lt;ref name=Thill&gt;{{cite web |url = https://www.wired.com/2010/11/grant-morrison-talking-with-gods-review/|title = Review: Talking With Gods Bows Down to Comics Immortal Grant Morrison|author = Thill, Scott|date = 2010|website = Wired.com|access-date = June 12, 2018| ref = refThill}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Morrison's particular take on chaos magic exemplified the irreverent, pop cultural elements of the tradition, with Morrison arguing that the deities of different religions ([[Hermes]], [[Mercury_(mythology)|Mercury]], [[Thoth]], [[Ganesh]], etc.) are nothing more than different cultural "glosses" for more universal "big ideas"&lt;ref name=Morrison/&gt; – and are therefore interchangeable: both with each other, and with other pop culture icons like [[The Flash]], or [[Metron_(comics)|Metron]], or [[Madonna_(entertainer)|Madonna]].&lt;ref name=Morrison/&gt;&lt;ref name=Babcock/&gt;

=== Post-chaos magic: 2010s ===

Over the course of the past decade, chaos magic has experienced a shift away from the pop cultural interpretation that typified the Lovecraft/Morrison era. Jason Miller has argued that contemporary occultism has entered a "post-chaos" phase, in which chaos magicians are increasingly initiating into "very old lineage traditions", partially triggered by the realisation that "imaginary gods and spirits or fictional characters ''do not'' seem to have the same effect as traditional ones".&lt;ref name=Miller&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.inominandum.com/blog/post-chaos-magic-1st-in-a-series/|title = Post Chaos Magic: 1st in a series.|author = Miller, Jason|date = 2012|website = Strategic Sorcery Blog|access-date = June 13, 2018| ref = refMiller}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hine has spoken of his disillusionment with the idea that all magic "can be formulated in terms of 'techniques' and that the theoretical underpinnings or cultural-historical context" do not matter:

&lt;blockquote&gt;...something you’ll sometimes see advocates of CM asserting is that singing [[rune]] charms and repeating [[Hindu]] [[mantras]] are essentially the same procedure – the focus being on the repetition of a word or phrase – in order to enter an altered state of consciousness. So mantras are something that gets chanted – and the chanting (i.e. the iteration) is what’s important – not the content or the context.

This, to me, is a kind of [[reductionism]]. It predicates a [[universalism|universal explanation]] – that the ‘technique’ of iterative speech is enacted in order to establish an [[altered state of consciousness]] in the practitioner – and subordinates all instances which apparently look as though that’s what’s going on – to it. So for an advocate of CM, there would be little practical difference between, say, chanting a [[rune]] poem, repeating the [[Gayatri]] mantra, or singing a [[sea shanty]].&lt;ref name=Blackwell/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Alan Chapman – whilst praising chaos magic for "breathing new life" into Western occultism, thereby saving it from "being lost behind a wall of overly complex symbolism and antiquated morality" – has also criticised chaos magic for its lack of "initiatory knowledge": i.e., "teachings that cannot be learned from books, but must be transmitted orally, or demonstrated", present in all traditional schools of magic.&lt;ref name=Chapman&gt;{{cite book | title = Advanced Magick for Beginners| author = Chapman, Alan | publisher = Karnac Books| year = 2008| isbn = 9781904658412| url = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=1lT7R6QD16oC | ref = refChapman}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chapman has gone on to develop his own system, using the techniques of chaos magic to achieve the aims of [[Thelema]], such as attaining the Knowledge and Conversation of the [[Holy Guardian Angel]], or the Crossing of [[Abyss_(Thelema)|the Abyss]].&lt;ref name=Chapman2&gt;{{cite book | title = Three Steps to Heaven: How to Practice Magick| author = Chapman, Alan | publisher = The Baptist's Head| year = 2009 | ref = refChapman2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gordon White, meanwhile, has developed a distinctive blend of chaos magic technique and [[animism]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;If the western esoteric tradition can be said to have an underlying belief system it is a form of Animism; that the world or the universe is in some sense a living thing... However you conceive of their 'true' nature, magic requires full engagement with [[Fetishism|fetishes]] and sacred ground and window areas such as [[Crossroads_(mythology)|crossroads]]. It also works best when you grant agency to objects or entities beyond human consciousness, and particularly so with living systems... It is more useful for the magician to consider living systems not as some unaware little eddies in a universal consciousness field, but as 'outposts' of the spirit world.&lt;ref name=White1/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

{{see also|Consent search case law|Terry stop case law}}

'''Consent searches''' (or consensual searches) are searches made by police officers in the United States based on the voluntary consent of the individual whose person or property is being searched. The simplest and most common type of [[warrantless searches in the United States]] are searches based upon consent. No [[Warrant (law)|warrant]], [[probable cause]] or [[reasonable suspicion]] is required to perform a search if a person, or someone else with the proper authority, consents to a search. 

A consent search assumes the individual, whose person or property is being searched, is aware that they have the right to refuse a search in a situation when confronted by law enforcement agents. By giving consent they are assumed to waive, freely and voluntarily, his or her [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourth Amendment]] rights, granting the officer permission to perform the search. Where consent is obtained through "deception" on the part of the police officer, the search may be determined to be an unreasonable search in violation of the Fourth Amendment.

The three main categories of searches are a search of a house, automobile or pedestrian. In the case of an automobile, it is assumed the officer has already seized the car and the encounter is a [[terry stop]]. When an officer returns a driver's identification, the encounter has been transformed into a consensual encounter. In the case of a pedestrian, an consensual encounter can lead to a terry stop based on information gathered during conversation. Some states and cities pass laws that require officer to notify a right to refuse in one case, but not the others.

{{TOC limit|3}}

The person has the right to refuse to give consent, and except in limited cases may revoke consent at any point during the search. In addition, the prosecution in any trial using the search results as evidence is required to prove that the consent was voluntary and not a result of coercion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Laser |first1=Rachel Karen |title=Unreasonable Suspicion: Relying on Refusals to Support Terry Stops |url=https://chicagounbound.uchicago.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=4882&amp;context=uclrev |journal=The University of Chicago Law Review |date=1995 |volume=62 |issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast to [[Miranda rights]], officers conducting a consent search are not required to warn people of their right to withhold consent in order for consent to be valid, as determined by the U.S. Supreme Court in ''[[Schneckloth v. Bustamonte]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gallini |first1=2011 |title=Schneckloth v. Bustamonte: History's Unspoken Fourth Amendment Anomaly |journal=Tennessee Law Review |date=2012 |volume=79 |url=http://www.academia.edu/download/28218298/Schneckloth_v._Bustamonte_Historys_Unspoken_Fourth_Amendment_Anomaly.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Police are not required to conduct1993), where the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit|U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit]] rejected the argument that “officials must conduct all searches in plain view of the suspect, and in a manner slowly enough that he may withdraw or delimit his consent at any time during the search.”

==Different categories of Consent searches==
===Pedestrian encounters===
Oftentimes an officer will have neither reasonable suspicion to stop an individual nor probable cause to arrest that person. A common tactic is to engage in conversation with the individual in an attempt to get them to incriminate themselves. This can, possibly, include a consent search.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |title=Investigative “Contacts” |url=http://le.alcoda.org/publications/files/CONTACTS.pdf |publisher=Alemeda County District Attorney's Office}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |title=Point of View - Investigative Contacts |url=http://le.alcoda.org/publications/point_of_view/files/W14_Contacts.pdf |publisher=Alemeda County District Attorney's Office}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Traffic stops===
A traffic stop is automatically a terry stop. In ''[[Ohio v. Robinette]]'' (1996) the Supreme Court decided an officer does not need to inform the driver that the stop has ended. He can continue questioning and request a search of the vehicle. Since the encounter has now become a consensual encounter it is outside the protection of the Fourth Amendment. The Supreme Court assumed that a reasonable person would know the encounter was over and feel free to drive away.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Dery |first=George M. III |date=1998 |title="When Will This Traffic Stop End?": The United States Supreme Court's Dodge of Every Detained Motorist's Central Concern—Ohio v. Robinette |url=https://ir.law.fsu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=https://www.google.com/&amp;httpsredir=1&amp;article=1411&amp;context=lr |journal=Florida State University Law Review |volume=25 |issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Home search===
Consent searches on people's homes have been given a higher level of scrutiny by the Supreme Court. This is because they happen in private without outside observers. The court is much more sensitive to the possibility of coercion and more guidelines have been put in place to protect against this.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |title=“Knock and Talks” |url=http://le.alcoda.org/publications/files/KNOCKandTALKS.pdf |publisher=Alemeda County District Attorney's Office}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Consent given by third parties==
The person conducting the consent search does not necessarily have to be identified as a law enforcement officer, and the person granting consent need not be the person police suspect or ultimately charge.

In cases such as ''Lee v. United States'', ''Lopez v. United States'', and ''Hoffa v. United States'', the courts have ruled that evidence found in searches based on consent obtained by an [[Undercover|undercover officer]] or as an informer to be admissible.

A party other than the defendant can, in some limited cases, grant consent. The consenting party needs to actually possess or be believed by the searching officer to possess “common authority over or other sufficient relationship to the premises or effects sought to be inspected.” For example, the Supreme Court in ''[[United States v. Matlock]]'' (1974) held that co-occupant of a house had actual authority to consent to a search of the house. In ''[[Illinois v. Rodriguez]]'' (1990), the Supreme Court held that a search was valid if the police reasonably believed that the party giving consent had actual authority over the premises, but were incorrect in their belief. When two co-occupants are present, and one consents to a search but the other expressly objects, the Supreme Court has found that the police cannot validly search the premises.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Georgia v. Randolph]]'', 547 U.S. 103 (2006)&lt;/ref&gt; However, if the objecting party is subsequently lawfully arrested and removed from the premises, the Court has held in ''[[Fernandez v. California]]'' (2014) that the police may search with the consent of the co-occupant remaining on the premises.

==Revoking consent and exceptions==
Consent can be revoked at almost any time during a consent-based search. If consent is revoked, the officer or officers performing the search are required to immediately stop searching. However, the right to revoke consent is not recognized in two cases: airport passenger screening and prison visitation.

===Withdrawing consent===
Once consent to search is given, an individual may withdraw or restrict a search. Consent is considered withdrawn if an unequivocal statement is made either through statements, actions, or a combination of both.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |title=Consent Search |url=http://le.alcoda.org/publications/files/CONSENTSEARCHES.pdf |publisher=Alemeda County District Attorney's Office}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Exceptions to revoking consent===
Most courts have found the right to revoke consent is removed once a passenger has begun [[X-ray]] screening. In ''United States v. Herzbrun'' (1984), the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit|U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit]] found Herzbrun “had no [[constitutional right]] to revoke his consent to a search of his bag once it entered the [[X-ray machine]] and he walked through the [[magnetometer]].” And in ''United States v. Pulido-Baquerizo'' (9th Cir. 1986), the court explained that “[a] rule allowing a passenger to leave without a search after an inconclusive X-ray scan would encourage airline [[terrorism]] by providing a secure exit where detection was threatened.”

A similar argument is applied to searches of prison visitors, for example, in ''United States v. Spriggs'' (1993).  As long as a prison visitor is warned that all visitors will be searched and consents to the search, consent cannot be revoked once the search has begun. Allowing consent to be withdrawn, the court reasoned, would encourage the smuggling of contraband into prisons by providing a secure escape to the smuggler.

During the course of a search an officer may develop [[reasonable suspicion]] or probable cause; once this has been developed the individual loses the right to revoke consent. However, in ''[[United States v. Fuentes]]'' (1997), the court found the “[m]ere refusal to consent to a stop or search does not give rise to reasonable suspicion or probable cause.”

==Cities and states requiring informed consent==
{{Expand section|1=additional cities and states: '''Columbia, MO, Asheville, NC'''|section=1|date=November 2018|small=no|talksection=Consent search}}

===Colorado===
In May of 2010, the state of Colorado enacted an informed consent law requiring police to inform drivers of their right to decline a consent search. The law was enacted in an effort to reduce racial profiling. It extends not only to drivers but also pedestrians. Because the law focused on Fourth Amendment protections, it was able to get bipartiasan agreement and was signed by the governor, a former tough-on-crime District Attorney.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Boven |first=Joseph |date=May 4, 2010 |title=Colorado’s new informed-consent bill celebrated as tool to fight racial profiling |url=https://www.coloradoindependent.com/2010/05/04/colorados-new-informed-consent-bill-celebrated-as-tool-to-fight-racial-profiling/ |work=The Colorado Independent}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fayetteville, North Carolina===
Fayetteville, North Carolina, (population 209,889) came under criticism after a study showed between 2009 to 2010 black motorists were three times more likely than whites to be searched after a stop. The city manager was forced out and the police chief retired. A law was passed requiring police to get written consent before performing a search beginning March, 2012. A new police chief was given a mandate to rebuild community trust.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Barksdale |first=Andrew |date=October 16, 2013 |title=Fayetteville police making fewer traffic stops |url=https://www.fayobserver.com/a811e907-396a-5a5c-abec-e8967d9b4223.html |work=The Fayetteville Observer}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Baumgartner |first=Frank R. |last2=Epp |first2=Derek, |last3=Shoub |first3=Kelsey |date=June 16, 2015 |title=Summary of Fayetteville Stops and Searches Before and After Written Consent Ruling Effective 2 March 2012 |url=http://fbaum.unc.edu/TrafficStops/Reports2014/Baumgartner-Fayetteville-WrittenConsentAnalysis.pdf |work=University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Johnson |first=Will D.

=== Durham, North Carolina ===
In October, 2014 Durham, North Carolina (pop. 267,743), in response to a collection of groups lead by the Southern Coalition for Social Justice, adopted a written-consent policy for all searches. This was after the city was presented with clear documentation that blacks motorist were searched well above their share to the city's population. In implementing the policy, the city manager said it was in the interests of regaining the trust of the community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Gronberg |first=Gronberg |date=September 16, 2014 |title=Durham adopts written-consent policy for searches |url=https://www.southerncoalition.org/durham-adopts-written-consent-policy-for-searches/ |work=Southern Coalition for Social Justice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== New York City ===

The Right to Know Act was passed in 2017 by New York City's city council in response to the aggressive use of [[Stop-and-frisk in New York City]] by the [[New York City Police Department|police department]].  The law consists of two parts. One is the "Consent to Search" law which requires an officer to inform someone they have the right to deny a search and to make sure that person understands that right. The other is the "NYPD ID" law which requires the officer, in certain situations, to hand out business cards with their name, rank, badge number and command. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Goodman |first=David J. |date=2017-12-17 |title=City Council Passes Bills on Police Behavior Amid Outcry on Both Sides. |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/19/nyregion/new-york-city-council-police-reform.html |work=New York Times |access-date=October 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Southall |first=Ashley |date=2018-10-19 |title=Right to Know Is Now the Law.

{{Nihongo|'''Ekai Kawaguchi'''|河口慧海|Kawaguchi Ekai}} (February 26, 1866 &amp;ndash; February 24, 1945) was a [[Japanese people|Japanese]] [[Buddhist monk]], famed for his four journeys to [[Nepal]] (in 1899, 1903, 1905 and 1913), and two to [[Tibet]] (July 4, 1900–June 15, 1902, 1913–1915), being the first recorded Japanese citizen to travel in either country.&lt;ref name="Japanese_Embassy" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hyer, Paul (1979). "Narita Yasuteru: First Japanese to Enter Tibet". ''Tibet Journal'' Vol. IV, No. 2, Autumn 1979, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;
==Life and early journey==
From an early age Kawaguchi, whose birth name was Sadajiro, was passionate about becoming a monk. In fact, his passion was unusual in a country that was quickly modernizing; he gave serious attention to the monastic vows of vegetarianism, chastity, and temperance even as other monks were happily abandoning them. As a result, he became disgusted with the worldliness and political corruption of the Japanese Buddhist world.&lt;ref&gt;Berry 1989, p. 11-12&lt;/ref&gt; Until March, 1891, he worked as the [[Rector (academia)|Rector]] of the [[Zen]] {{Nihongo|[[Gohyaku rakan]] Monastery|五百羅漢寺|Gohyaku-rakan-ji}} in Tokyo (a large temple which contains 500 ''[[arhat|rakan]]'' icons). He then spent about 3 years as a hermit in [[Kyoto]] studying Chinese Buddhist texts and learning Pali, to no use; he ran into political squabbles even as a hermit. Finding Japanese Buddhism too corrupt, he decided to go to Tibet instead, despite the fact that the region was officially off limits to all foreigners. In fact, unbeknownst to Kawaguchi, Japanese religious scholars had spent most of the 1890s trying to enter Tibet to find rare Buddhist sutras, with the backing of large institutions and scholarships, but had inevitably failed.&lt;ref&gt;Okuyama 2008, pp. 215-7.&lt;/ref&gt;

He left Japan for India in June, 1897, without a guide or map, simply buying his way onto a cargo boat. He had a smattering of English but did not know a word of Hindi or Tibetan. Also, he had no money, having refused the donations of his friends; instead, he made several fishmonger and butcher friends pledge to give up their professions forever and become vegetarian, claiming that the good karma would ensure his success.&lt;ref&gt;Berry 1989, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; Success appeared far from guaranteed, but arriving in India with very little money, he somehow entered the good graces of [[Sarat Chandra Das]], an Indian British agent and Tibetan scholar, and was given passage to northern India. Kawaguchi would later be accused of spying for Das, but there is no evidence for this, and a close reading of his diary makes it seem quite unlikely.&lt;ref&gt;[[Hopkirk, Peter]] (1997): ''Trespassers on the Roof of the World: The Secret Exploration of Tibet'', pp. 150-151; 157. Kodansha Globe (Pbk). {{ISBN|978-1-56836-050-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Kawaguchi stayed in [[Darjeeling]] for several months living with a Tibetan family by Das' arrangement. He became fluent in the Tibetan language, which was at that time neither systematically taught to foreigners nor compiled, by talking to children and women on the street.&lt;ref&gt;Berry 1989, p. 26-7&lt;/ref&gt;

Crossing over the Himalayas on an unpatrolled dirt road with an untrustworthy guide, Kawaguchi soon found himself alone and lost on the Tibetan plateau. He had the good fortune to befriend every wanderer he met in the countryside, including monks, shepherds, and even bandits, but he still took almost four years to reach Lhasa after stopovers at a number of monasteries and a pilgrimage round sacred [[Mount Kailash]] in western Tibet. He posed as a Chinese monk and gained a reputation as an excellent doctor which led to him having an audience with the 13th [[Dalai Lama]], [[Thubten Gyatso]] (1876 to 1933).&lt;ref&gt;Kawaguchi 1909, pp. 309-322&lt;/ref&gt; He spent some time living in [[Sera Monastery]].&lt;ref&gt;Kawaguchi 1909, pp. 323-328.&lt;/ref&gt;  

Kawaguchi devoted his entire time in Tibet to Buddhist pilgrimage and study. Although he mastered the difficult terminology of the classical Tibetan language and was able to pass for a Tibetan, he was surprisingly intolerant of Tibetans' minor violations of monastic laws, and of the eating of meat in a country with very little arable farmland. As a result, he did not fit in well in monastic circles, instead finding work as a doctor of Chinese and Western medicine. His services were soon in high demand.&lt;ref&gt;Berry 1989, pp. 169-200&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Tibetan Buddhism}}
Kawaguchi spent his time in Lhasa in disguise and, following a tip that his cover had been blown, had to flee the country hurriedly. He almost petitioned the government to let him stay as an honest and apolitical monk, but the intimations of high-ranking friends convinced him not to. Even so, several of the people who had sheltered him were horribly tortured and mutilated.&lt;ref&gt;[[Hopkirk, Peter]] (1997): ''Trespassers on the Roof of the World: The Secret Exploration of Tibet'', pp. 149, 154. Kodansha Globe (Pbk). {{ISBN|978-1-56836-050-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Kawaguchi was deeply concerned for his friends, and despite his ill health and lack of funds, after leaving the country he used all his connections to petition the Nepalese Prime Minister [[Chandra Shamsher Jang Bahadur Rana|Chandra Shumsher Rana]] for help. On the Prime Minister's recommendation, the Tibetan Government released Kawaguchi's loyal Tibetan friends from jail.&lt;ref name="Japanese_Embassy"&gt;"The First Recorded Japanese Visitor: Ekai Kawaguchi" - pdf file from the Japanese Embassy in Nepal. [http://www.np.emb-japan.go.jp/graph/relation/ekai.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reporting in Japan==
When Kawaguchi finally returned to Japan he caused a sensation and an instant surge of interest in distant Tibet. His travelogue, quickly published based on talks he gave, shows his shock at the lack of hygiene amongst Tibetans, the filth of Tibetan cities, and by many Tibetan customs, including sexual practices, monastic immoderation, corruption and superstitious beliefs. On the other hand, he had great admiration for many Tibetans ranging from great religious and political leaders to common people and made many friends while he was in Tibet.&lt;ref&gt;Berry (2005), pp. 37-45, 57.&lt;/ref&gt; Ironically given Kawaguchi's faithful background, newspapers criticized his lectures to the public about Tibetan hygiene and sexual practices as being a hodge-podge of lowbrow humor and dirty stories unbecoming of a monk.&lt;ref&gt;Okuyama 2008, p. 208.&lt;/ref&gt;

Narita Yasuteru, a Japanese spy secretly dispatched to Tibet in the late 1890s, anonymously accused Kawaguchi of having never been there; this accusation was quickly debunked by the Japanese newspapers.&lt;ref&gt;Berry 1989, pp. 250-251&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, internal documents show that Narita himself had never reached Tibet on his expensive spy mission, making Kawaguchi the first person to have actually arrived there.&lt;ref&gt;Kimura 1981&lt;/ref&gt;

==Further travels==

Partly as a result of hearing about the discovery of an [[Ashoka Pillar]] in 1896 identifying [[Lumbini]] as the birthplace of Gautama Buddha, he visited Lumbini with other Japanese pilgrims in 1912. He then returned to Tibet a final time in 1913. While his more mature narrative of this trip is mainly occupied with Japanese poems about the beauty of the land, he could not resist some final criticisms of the monks' lax attitude towards monastic rules.&lt;ref&gt;Berry 1989, p. 292&lt;/ref&gt; He brought back to Japan a large collection of Tibetan scriptures, but had a lengthy and public dispute with the other pilgrims about who the Dalai Lama had intended to give them to, causing him to lose some face in the Buddhist world.&lt;ref&gt;Okuyama 2008, p. 222.&lt;/ref&gt; He did assist the German Theravada monk [[Nyanatiloka]] in the 1920s.

After this Kawaguchi became an independent monk, living with his brother's family for the rest of his life, and earning an income from scholarly publications. He refused to assist the military police when they sought intelligence on Tibet, and died in 1945.&lt;ref&gt;Berry 1989, p. 299&lt;/ref&gt;

He was a friend of Mrs. [[Annie Besant]], President of the [[Theosophical Society]], who encouraged him to publish the English text of his book, ''Three Years in Tibet''.&lt;ref&gt;Kawaguchi, Ekai (1909): ''Three Years in Tibet'', page vii. Reprint: Book Faith India (1995), Delhi. {{ISBN|81-7303-036-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Government of Nepal issued a postage stamp in 2003 commemorating Kawaguchi's visits to that country. He is also said to have planted two saplings of Himalayan Cicada trees (also called: Riang Riang; ''[[Ploiarium alternifolium]]''), which he had brought back with him, near the gate of the Obaku-san Manpukuji [[Zen]] Buddhist temple on the outskirts of [[Kyoto]], where he had studied as a young man.&lt;ref&gt; These are now grown into tall trees. From the Japanese embassy in Nepal [http://www.np.emb-japan.go.jp/history/ekai.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Buddhist Doctrinal Reformer==
Kawaguchi was disturbed by the confusing messages of the [[honzon|main objects of veneration]] based on a pantheon of deities, spirits, historical and mythological figures.  Instead he called for a return to veneration of [[Shakyamuni]] and lay-centered practice.&lt;ref name="Auerback 2016"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Auerback|first1=Micah L.|title=A Storied Sage: Canon and Creation in the Making of a Japanese Buddha|date=2016|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=9780226286389|page=4 |url=https://books.google.at/books?id=83GpDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA4&amp;lpg=PA4&amp;dq=mudra+japanese+honzon&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Vs7xACmMeP&amp;sig=Yv6bCE7Kj-ZwSDiKghY7jopVk9Y&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjVu9n-kojUAhWJLcAKHZKEBzEQ6AEIPDAD#v=snippet&amp;q=kawaguchi&amp;f=false|quote=Kawaguchi recounted these details to illustrate the absurdity and disorder resulting from the lack of any single, unifying focus of devotion in Japanese Buddhism. His enumeration begins with deities inherited from India: transcendent, "cosmic" buddhas, and bodhisattvas, "wisdom-beings" who serve as compassionate saviors. The "Great Masters" whom he mentions each stand as the font of a different Buddhist denomination; in each case, the extraordinary life and works of the founder earned him a place as an object of devotion in his own right. The remaining "extreme cases" include a celebrated warrior of medieval Japan, along with lowly trickster animals, among a legion of Indian deities brought to Japan as part of the broader Buddhist pantheon.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7261">'''Empowered democracy''' is an alternative form of social-democratic arrangements developed by philosopher and politician [[Roberto Mangabeira Unger]]. Theorized in response to the repressiveness and rigidity of contemporary [[liberal democratic]] society, the theory of empowered democracy envisions a more open and more plastic set of social institutions through which individuals and groups can interact, propose change, and effectively empower themselves to transform social, economic, and political structures. The key strategy is to combine freedom of commerce and governance at the local level with the ability of political parties at the central level to promote radical [[social experiment]]s that would bring about decisive change in social and political institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Unger|first=Roberto Mangabeira|title=False Necessity: Anti-necessitarian social theory in the service of radical democracy|year=1987|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|pages=see esp. ch. 5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The theory of empowered democracy has received widespread critical acclaim. It has been hailed as the only such constructive vision of society in critical legal studies,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Eidenmüller|first=Horst|author-link=Horst Eidenmüller|title=Rights, Systems of Rights, and Unger's System of Rights|journal=Law and Philosophy|date=February 1991|volume=10|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the term has since seeped into the mainstream media, even if the theory has not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Let an empowered democracy bloom|url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2006/aug/05/mainsection.guardianletters5|accessdate=11 September 2011|newspaper=The Guardian|date=August 5, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, [[Cornel West]], [[Perry Anderson]], [[Richard Rorty]], and numerous other prominent scholars have published detailed—and, very often, admiring—essays on Unger's project.&lt;ref name="franca"&gt;{{cite web|last=Press|first=Eyal|title=The Passion of Roberto Unger|url=http://linguafranca.mirror.theinfo.org/9903/unger.html|publisher=Lingua Franca|accessdate=4 July 2011|date=March 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
In practice, the theory would involve radical developments in politics at the center, as well as social innovation in localities. At the center, by bestowing wide ranging revisionary powers to those in office, it would give political parties the ability to try out concrete yet profound solutions and proposals. It would turn partisan conflicts over control and uses of governmental power into an opportunity to question and revise the basic arrangements of social life through a rapid resolution of political impasse. In local communities, empowered democracy would make capital and technology available through rotating capital funds, which would encourage entrepreneurship and innovation. Citizens rights include individual entitlements to economic and civic security, conditional and temporary group claims to portions of social capital, and destabilization rights, which would empower individuals or groups to disrupt organizations and practices marred by routines of subjugation that normal politics have failed to disrupt.&lt;ref&gt;This summary is drawn from {{cite book|last=Unger|first=Roberto Mangabeira|title=Plasticity into Power: Comparative-historical studies on the institutional conditions of economic and military success|year=1987|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|pages=87–88}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Policy points==
Alongside the philosophy of empowered democracy, Unger has laid out concrete policy proposals in areas of economic development, education, civil society, and political democracy.&lt;ref&gt;These policy points are taken from Unger, Roberto Mangabeira, ''The self awakened: pragmatism unbound'' (Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press, 2007),
and Unger, Roberto Mangabeira, [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uN7PLK6H-KU&amp;list=UUbaZ_Vc_T7tm7iZSV-mMKMg&amp;index=3&amp;feature=plcp  What Progressives Should Propose]. September 2011&lt;/ref&gt;  
* On '''economic development''', Unger has noted that there are only two models for a national economy available to us today: the US model of business control of government, and the northeast Asian model of top down bureaucratic control of the economy. Citing the need for greater imagination on the issue, he has offered a third model that is decentralized, pluralistic, participatory, and experimental. This would take the form of an economy encouraging small business development and innovation that would create large scale self-employment and cooperation. The emphasis is not on the protection of big business as the main sectors of the economy, but the highly mobile and innovative small firm.
* Unger links the development of such an economy to an '''education system''' that encourages creativity and empowers the mind, not one that he now sees geared for a reproduction of the family and to put the individual in service of the state. He proposes that such a system should be run locally but have standards enforced through national oversight, as well as a procedure in place to intervene in the case of the failing of local systems.
* Unger's critique of and alternative to social programs goes to the heart of '''civil society'''. The problem we are faced with now, he claims, is that we have a bureaucratic system of distribution that provides lower quality service and prohibits the involvement of civil society in the provision of public services. The alternative he lays out is to have the state act to equip civil society to partake in public services and care. This would entail empowering each individual to have two responsibilities, one in the productive economy and one in the caring economy.
* Unger's proposal for '''political democracy''' calls for a high energy system that diminishes the dependence of change upon crisis. This can be done, he claims, by breaking the constant threat of stasis and institutionalization of politics and parties through five institutional innovations. First, increase collective engagement through the public financing of campaigns and giving free access to media outlets. Second, hasten the pace of politics by breaking legislative deadlock though the enabling of the party in power to push through proposals and reforms, and for opposition parties to be able to dissolve the government and call for immediate elections. Third, the option of any segment of society to opt out of the political process and to propose alternative solutions for its own governance. Fourth, give the state the power to rescue oppressed groups that are unable to liberate themselves through collective action. Fifth, direct participatory democracy in which active engagement is not purely in terms of financial support and wealth distribution, but through which people are directly involved in their local and national affairs through proposal and action.

=== Domestication and breeding ===
[[File:Big and little dog 1.jpg|thumb|right|This [[Chihuahua (dog)|Chihuahua]] [[mixed-breed dog|mix]] and [[Great Dane]] show the wide range of dog breed sizes created using [[artificial selection]].]]
Unwittingly, humans have carried out evolution experiments for as long as they have been [[Domestication|domesticating]] plants and animals. [[Selective breeding]] of plants and animals has led to varieties that differ dramatically from their original wild-type ancestors. Examples are the [[cabbage]] varieties, [[maize]], or the large number of different [[dog]] breeds. The power of human breeding to create varieties with extreme differences from a single species was already recognized by [[Charles Darwin]]. In fact, he started out his book ''[[The Origin of Species]]'' with a chapter on variation in domestic animals. In this chapter, Darwin discussed in particular the pigeon.
{{quotation|Altogether at least a score of pigeons might be chosen, which if shown to an ornithologist, and he were told that they were wild birds, would certainly, I think, be ranked by him as well-defined species. Moreover, I do not believe that any ornithologist would place the English carrier, the short-faced tumbler, the runt, the barb, pouter, and fantail in the same genus; more especially as in each of these breeds several truly-inherited sub-breeds, or species as he might have called them, could be shown him.
(...) I am fully convinced that the common opinion of naturalists is correct, namely, that all have descended from the rock-pigeon (''Columba livia''), including under this term several geographical races or sub-species, which differ from each other in the most trifling respects.|[[Charles Darwin]]|The Origin of Species}}

[[File:Dallinger Incubator J.R.Microscop.Soc.1887p193.png|thumb|Drawing of the incubator used by Dallinger in his evolution experiments.]]
One of the first to carry out a controlled evolution experiment was [[William Dallinger]]. In the late 19th century, he cultivated small [[unicellular organism]]s in a custom-built incubator over a time period of seven years (1880–1886). Dallinger slowly increased the temperature of the incubator from an initial 60&amp;nbsp;°F up to 158&amp;nbsp;°F. The early cultures had shown clear signs of distress at a temperature of 73&amp;nbsp;°F, and were certainly not capable of surviving at 158&amp;nbsp;°F. The organisms Dallinger had in his incubator at the end of the experiment, on the other hand, were perfectly fine at 158&amp;nbsp;°F. However, these organisms would no longer grow at the initial 60&amp;nbsp;°F. Dallinger concluded that he had found evidence for Darwinian adaptation in his incubator, and that the organisms had adapted to live in a high-temperature environment. Dallinger's incubator was accidentally destroyed in 1886, and Dallinger could not continue this line of research.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hass|first=J.

From the 1880s to 1980, experimental evolution was intermittently practiced by a variety of evolutionary biologists, including the highly influential [[Theodosius Dobzhansky]]. Like other experimental research in evolutionary biology during this period, much of this work lacked extensive replication and was carried out only for relatively short periods of evolutionary time.&lt;ref name="Dobzhansky 1957"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dobzhansky|first1=T|last2=Pavlovsky|first2=O|title=An experimental study of interaction between genetic drift and natural selection|journal=Evolution|date=1957|volume=11|issue=3|pages=311–319|doi=10.2307/2405795|jstor=2405795}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aphids===
In the 1950s, the Soviet biologist Georgy Shaposhnikov conducted [[:ru:Опыты Георгия Шапошникова по искусственной эволюции|experiments]] on aphids of the [[species:Dysaphis|Dysaphis]] genus. By transferring them to plants normally nearly or completely unsuitable for them, he had forced populations of parthenogenetic descendants to adapt to the new food source to the point of reproductive isolation from the regular populations of the same species.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20130908054552/http://rogov.zwz.ru/Macroevolution/epi17.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Fruit flies ===
One of the first of a new wave of experiments using this strategy was the laboratory "evolutionary radiation" of ''[[Drosophila melanogaster]]'' populations that Michael R. Rose started in February, 1980.&lt;ref name='Rose1984a'&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rose|first=M. R.|year=1984|title=Artificial selection on a fitness component in ''Drosophila melanogaster''| jstor=2408701|journal=Evolution|volume=38|issue=3|pages=516–526|doi=10.2307/2408701}}&lt;/ref&gt; This system started with ten populations, five cultured at later ages, and five cultured at early ages. Since then more than 200 different populations have been created in this laboratory radiation, with selection targeting multiple characters. Some of these highly differentiated populations have also been selected "backward" or "in reverse," by returning experimental populations to their ancestral culture regime. Hundreds of people have worked with these populations over the better part of three decades. Much of this work is summarized in the papers collected in the book ''Methuselah Flies''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.worldscientific.com/worldscibooks/10.1142/5457#t=aboutBook|title=Methuselah Flies|last=Rose|first=Michael R|last2=Passananti|first2=Hardip B|last3=Matos|first3=Margarida|publisher=World Scientific|year=2004|isbn=978-981-238-741-7|location=Singapore|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The early experiments in flies were limited to studying phenotypes but the molecular mechanisms, i.e., changes in DNA that facilitated such changes, could not be identified. This changed with genomics technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Burke MK, Dunham JP |title= Genome-wide analysis of a long-term evolution experiment with Drosophila |journal=Nature |date=Sep 2015 |pmid=20844486 |doi=10.1038/nature09352|display-authors=etal |volume=467 |pages=587–90}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, Thomas Turner coined the term Evolve and Resequence (E&amp;R)&lt;ref name="Turner TL, Stewart AD, et al"/&gt; and several studies used E&amp;R approach with mixed success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Schlötterer C, Tobler R, Kofler R, Nolte V |title=Sequencing pools of individuals - mining genome-wide polymorphism data without big funding |journal=Nat.

=== Bacteria ===

Bacteria have short [[generation time]]s, easily sequenced genomes, and well-understood biology. They are therefore commonly used for experimental evolution studies.

==== Lenski's ''E. coli'' experiment ====
{{Main article|E. coli long-term evolution experiment}}
One of the most widely known examples of laboratory bacterial evolution is the [[E. coli long-term evolution experiment|long-term ''E.coli'' experiment]] of [[Richard Lenski]]. On February 24, 1988, Lenski started growing twelve lineages of ''[[E. coli]]'' under identical growth conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lenski|first=Richard E.|last2=Rose|first2=Michael R.|last3=Simpson|first3=Suzanne C.|last4=Tadler|first4=Scott C.|date=1991-12-01|title=Long-Term Experimental Evolution in Escherichia coli.

The experiment continues to this day, and is now the longest-running (in terms of generations) controlled evolution experiment ever undertaken.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}} Since the inception of the experiment, the bacteria have grown for more than 60,000 generations. Lenski and colleagues regularly publish updates on the status of the experiments.&lt;ref&gt;[http://myxo.css.msu.edu/ecoli/ E. coli Long-term Experimental Evolution Project Site], Lenski, R.

=== Laboratory mice ===
[[File:Wheel Counter Box 1.jpg|thumb|left|Mouse from the Garland selection experiment with attached running wheel and its rotation counter.]]

In 1998, [[Theodore Garland, Jr.]] and colleagues started a long-term experiment that involves selective breeding of [[Laboratory mouse|mice]] for high voluntary activity levels on running wheels.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biology.ucr.edu/people/faculty/Garland/SwEA98SE.pdf Artificial Selection for Increased Wheel-Running Behavior in House Mice], John G. Swallow, Patrick A. Carter, and [[Theodore Garland, Jr.]], ''Behavior Genetics'', Vol. 28, No. 3, 1998&lt;/ref&gt; This experiment also continues to this day (&gt; 65 [[generation]]s). Mice from the four replicate "High Runner" lines evolved to run almost three times as many running-wheel revolutions per day compared with the four unselected control lines of mice, mainly by running faster than the control mice rather than running for more minutes/day.

[[File:LitterMom1480.jpg|thumb|right|Female mouse with her litter, from the Garland selection experiment.]]

The HR mice exhibit an elevated [[VO2max|maximal aerobic capacity]] when tested on a motorized treadmill.  They also exhibit alterations in [[motivation]] and the [[reward system]] of the [[brain]]. [[Pharmacological]] studies point to alterations in [[dopamine]] function and the [[endocannabinoid system]].&lt;ref name='Keeneyetal2008'&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Keeney BK, Raichlen DA, Meek TH, Wijeratne RS, Middleton KM, Gerdeman GL, Garland T |year=2008|title=Differential response to a selective cannabinoid receptor antagonist (SR141716: rimonabant) in female mice from lines selectively bred for high voluntary wheel-running behavior| url=http://www.biology.ucr.edu/people/faculty/Garland/Keeney_et_al_2008_rimonabant.pdf|journal=Behavioural Pharmacology|volume=19|issue=8|pages=812–820|doi=10.1097/FBP.0b013e32831c3b6b|pmid=19020416}}&lt;/ref&gt; The High Runner lines have been proposed as a model to study human attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder ([[ADHD]]), and administration of [[Ritalin]] reduces their wheel running approximately to the levels of control mice.

[[Stickleback]] fish have both marine and freshwater species, the freshwater species evolving since the last ice age. Freshwater species can survive colder temperatures. Scientists tested to see if they could reproduce this evolution of cold-tolerance by keeping marine sticklebacks in cold freshwater.

'''Friedrich Dessauer''' (19 July 1881 &amp;ndash; 16 February 1963) was a physicist, a philosopher, a socially engaged entrepreneur and a journalist.

Friedrich Dessauer was born in [[Aschaffenburg]], [[Germany]].  As a young man he was fascinated by new discoveries in the natural sciences. He was particularly interested in the [[X-rays]] discovered by [[Wilhelm Röntgen|Röntgen]] and their medical applications. Dessauer studied at the Goethe University in [[Frankfurt am Main]] until 1917. From 1924 to 1933 he was a [[Centre Party (Germany)|Zentrum]] party member of the Reichstag, the German Parliament.&lt;ref name="mitcham"&gt;{{cite book

He was released at request of the [[Turkey|Turkish]] government, who invited him to the [[University of Istanbul]], where he was made chair of the Institute. Here he worked together with [[Erich Uhlmann]] to develop medical applications of X-rays in Turkey. He moved to [[Fribourg University]] in 1937 to become the chair of experimental physics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

'''Gianfranco Miglio''' (11 January 1918 – 10 August 2001) was an [[Italy|Italian]] [[jurist]], [[political scientist]] and [[politician]], founder of the [[Federalist Party (Italy)|Partito Federalista]]. For 30 years, he presided over the Political science Faculty of [[Milan]]'s [[Università Cattolica del Sacro Cuore|Università Cattolica]] (Catholic University). Later on in his life, he was elected as an independent member of the Parliament to the [[Italian Senate]] for the ''[[Lega Nord]]''.&lt;ref name=r1/&gt; The supporters of ''[[Umberto Bossi]]'' 's party called him ''Prufesùr'' (the Professor), a [[Lombard language|Lombard]] nickname to remember his role.

Inspired by [[Max Weber]] and [[Carl Schmitt]], Miglio's works have analysed prevailing power structures in politics, parliamentarianism and bureaucracies. An advocate of [[federalism]], Miglio grew even more radical in his later years, moving to a [[confederal]] or even [[secessionist]] and [[libertarianism|libertarian]] standpoint, in part due to his readings of [[Étienne de La Boétie]] and [[Henry David Thoreau]].&lt;ref&gt;{{it icon}} [http://ricerca.repubblica.it/repubblica/archivio/repubblica/1993/09/07/miglio-non-merita-di-essere-italiano.html ' Miglio Non Merita Di Essere Italiano' – La Repubblica.It].

'''Global Peace System''' is a concept of global [[conflict resolution]] dependent on nonviolent processes to eradicate war. It relies upon a multi-strand approach to conflict resolution, incorporating broad social and political solutions. In contemporary [[peace and conflict studies]], the concept of a global peace system has been evolving since the 1940s around the theory that there is a global infrastructure of peacebuilding and that there is a need for [[systems thinking]] in peacebuilding.&lt;ref&gt;See Zelizer 2013 and Ricigliano 2013; peacebuilding here is considered as integrated efforts in numerous sectors ranging from humanitarian relief to international development (Zelizer, 2013)&lt;/ref&gt;  The term "global peace system" was coined from the work of Robert Johansen, who explored the concept in 1978's ''Toward a Dependable Place''.&lt;ref name=Mc2007&gt;McElwee 2007, p. 189.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origins and evolution ==
An early use of the term “peace system” occurred in Kirby Page’s book ''National Defense'' (1931).&lt;ref&gt; See p. vi (paragraph 4) and pp. 348, 357; p. vi, "Confronted with an ominous world situation, shall we seek security in increased armaments or shall we put our reliance in a peace system?" The book ends (p. 357) by calling on "the individual citizen . . . to dedicate himself to the task of strengthening the peace system." &lt;/ref&gt; In a 1943 pamphlet and a 1966 book, political theorist David Mitrany stated that the prevention of wars required the creation of a peace system which he outlined.&lt;ref&gt;Mitrany 1966&lt;/ref&gt; In 1978's ''Toward a Dependable Place'', Johansen coined the term "global peace system",&lt;ref name=Mc2007/&gt; arguing that, contrary to the advocated and perceived military security in the international system, the peace system provides greater justice, economic well-being and ecological security. In a global peace system, according to Johansen, "conflict is resolved through nonviolent, political, social, and judicial processes. There are no expectations of war and no national military arsenals."&lt;ref&gt;Johansen 1978 p. 16&lt;/ref&gt; Johansen called for the creation of such a system by a people’s movement.

In 1988, Robert A. Irwin stated that a peace system involves multiple war prevention layers: first, global reforms which reduce the causes of war involve non-threatening defense-policies as well as political, economic, ecological and cultural change; second, conflict resolution mechanisms on the local, regional, national and global level.&lt;ref&gt;Irwin 1988&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1991, Louise Diamond and John W. McDonald authored ''Multi-track Diplomacy: a Systems Approach to Peace'', wherein they identified nine specific tracks to produce a synergy in peacebuilding: public opinion and communication, government, professional conflict resolution, business, private citizens, activism, religion, funding, and research, training and education.&lt;ref&gt;Institute for Multi-track Diplomacy "Building Peace"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Diamond and McDonald 1993&lt;/ref&gt; In 1992, the pair founded the United States-based non-profit organization [[Institute for Multi-track Diplomacy]] with the mission of putting into practice their systems-based approach to peacebuilding.&lt;ref&gt;Institute for Multi-track Diplomacy "Mission"&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003's ''Instead of War: the Urgency and Promise of the Global Peace System'', Timothy McElwee emphasizes three major focal areas in the construction of a global peace system: (1) strengthening international norms and institutions against war; (2) eliminating the conditions that give rise to war and violence; (3) supporting and encouraging alternative means of international conflict transformation.&lt;ref&gt;McElwee 2003&lt;/ref&gt; Other sector-based approaches to peacebuilding link international development, humanitarian assistance, gender, the private sector, religion, environmental change, security, media, health and the rule of law.&lt;ref&gt;Zelizer 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, Kent Shifferd proposed that there is a good chance to outlaw war within the next 100 years. Examining the history of peace, Shifferd posits that there has been more peace than war in history and numerous peace movements were active even during war times. Referring to the global peace system, Shifferd states that most of what needs to be invented to end war has been invented.&lt;ref&gt;Shifferd 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Rob Ricigliano in 2012 stated that "while...difficult to ascribe specific causation to any one group, the positive trends … indicate that the international community, practitioners, and academics have learned important lessons about ending wars and building peace.”&lt;ref&gt;Ricigliano 2012, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing in 2013, Douglas Fry noted that the creation of a global peace system involves synergistic elements such as a transformative vision that a peace-based global system is possible, the understanding of [[interdependence]] and [[cooperation]], an added level of [[Social identity theory|social identity]] including all human beings, the creation of effective and democratic procedures of international adjudication, and peace-supporting symbols and values.&lt;ref&gt;Fry 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in 2003, peace ethologist [[Judith Hand]] approached the subject of a paradigm shift to a global peace system from biological, behavioral, anthropological, and gender perspectives.&lt;ref name = "WBP"&gt;2003 ''Women, Power, and the Biology of Peace''. San Diego, CA : Questpath Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "TAW"&gt;2010 Hand, Judith L. "To Abolish War." ''Journal of Aggression, Conflict, and Peace Research'' 2(4): 44-56.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "SHIFT"&gt;2014 ''Shift: The Beginning of War, The Ending of War''. San Diego, CA : Questpath Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = WSHD&gt;2018 ''War and Sex and Human Destiny''. San Diego, CA: Questpath Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt;. Based on the biological principles of [[sexual dimorphism]] and [[parental investment]] theory and the political principle of [[gender parity]] in government (which she termed koinoniarchy) she argued that gender parity in governing is a necessary condition, not an option, for establishment and maintenance of a global peace system.&lt;ref&gt;Hand 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3785">'''Glue semantics''', or simply '''Glue''' (Dalrymple et al. 1993; Dalrymple 1999, 2001), is a linguistic theory of semantic composition and the syntax-semantics interface which assumes that meaning composition is constrained by a set of instructions stated within a formal logic ([[linear logic]]).  These instructions, called ''meaning constructors'', state how the meanings of the parts of a sentence can be combined to provide the meaning of the sentence.

Glue was developed as a theory of the syntax-semantics interface within the linguistic theory of [[lexical functional grammar]], and most work within Glue has been conducted within that framework.  LFG-Glue assumes that the syntactic structure that is most relevant for meaning assembly is the functional structure, a structure which represents abstract syntactic predicate argument structure and relations like subject and object.  In this setting, a meaning constructor for an [[intransitive verb]] states that the verb combines with the meaning of its subject to produce a meaning for the sentence.  This is similar in some respects to the view of the syntax-semantics interface assumed within [[categorial grammar]], except that abstract syntactic relations like ''subject'' and ''object'' rather than relations such as ''to-the-left-of'' are involved in meaningful constructor specifications.  Glue analyses within other syntactic formalisms have also been proposed; besides LFG, glue analyses have been proposed within [[HPSG]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |url=http://web.stanford.edu/group/cslipublications/cslipublications/HPSG/2/Ash-Crouch-pn.pdf |title=Glue Semantics for HPSG|first=Ash |last=Asudeh |last2=Crouch|first2=Richard|year=2001|editor-last=van Eynde|editor-first=Frank|editor2-last=Hellan|editor2-first=Lars|editor3-last=Beermann|editor3-first=Dorothee |book-title=Proceedings of the 8th International HPSG Conference |publisher=CSLI Publications |pages=1–19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[context-free grammar]], [[categorial grammar]], and [[tree-adjoining grammar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|last=Frank|first=Anette|last2=van Genabith|first2=Josef|date=2001|editor-last=Butt|editor-first=Miriam|editor2-last=King|editor2-first=Tracy Holloway|title=Glue Tag: Linear Logic based Semantics Construction for LTAG – and What it Teaches Us About the Relation Between LFG and LTAG|url=http://web.stanford.edu/group/cslipublications/cslipublications/LFG/6/pdfs/lfg01frankgenabith.pdf|book-title=Proceedings of the LFG01 Conference|pages=104–126}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Glue is a theory of the syntax-semantics interface which is compatible not only with various syntactic frameworks, but also with different theories of semantics and meaning representation.  Semantic formalisms that have been used as the meaning languages in glue semantics analyses include versions of [[discourse representation theory]], [[intensional logic]], [[first-order logic]], and [[natural semantic metalanguage]].

'''''Individualism Old and New''''' is a politically and socially [[Progressivism|progressive]] book by [[John Dewey]], an American philosopher, written in 1930. Written at the beginning of the [[Great Depression]], the book argues that the emergence of a new kind of American individualism necessitates political and cultural reform to achieve the true liberation of the individual in a world where the individual has become submerged. Most of the chapters originally appeared as a series of essays in The New Republic, in 1929-1930.
 
==Overview==
Dewey argues that America has become a socially corporate materialistic society which has been consumed by a culture of private pecuniary gain. Yet he also sees a simultaneous contradiction, for Americans do not outwardly value private gain in and of itself. Thus the individual is lost in a world of multiple and nearly meaningless associations; and until the individual and his groups are harmonized as one, the individual will remain submerged. However, the problem remains undiagnosed and unseen, for intellectuals are held back by their belief in an "older" individualism that refuses to acknowledge the corporate nature of American society. 

Dewey writes that "as long as this conception possesses our minds, the ideal of harmonizing our thought and desire with the realities of our present social conditions will be interpreted to mean accommodation and surrender." 

He thus argues for some kind of "[[socialism]]" where industry is controlled by democratic means. He argues that fixing the problem with culture is the same with that of liberating the individual: by abolishing culture driven by private pecuniary gain and reaffirming the importance of community and industrial cooperative control, Dewey argues that the individual will be harmonized with his communities and liberated to achieve true progress.

==Chapters==
'''1. The House Divided Against Itself:'''
Ironically, this references [[Abraham Lincoln|Abraham Lincoln's ]][[Lincoln's House Divided Speech|nomination acceptance speech]], but Dewey is claiming that the new division is in the American mind. Americans still claim that people should act morally, and not solely out of selfish desire for profit, yet in all practical matters, they pursue and reward behavior that is selfish and profit driven.

'''2. "America"--By Formula:'''
American [[capitalism]] is not completely bad because it has brought people in the world together in some senses. However, American culture is flawed because it is materialistic and has become characterized by three things: quantification, mechanization, and standardization.  As a result, in America the human soul is impersonalized and its spiritual growth is stunted. 

'''3. The United States, Incorporated:'''
In the U.S., pioneer individualism has been replaced by corporateness in the sense that the choices and actions of individuals are increasingly defined by more or less organized associations. Organized associations rather than isolated individuals direct and animate amusements (theater chains), sports (college sports), organized crime, and apartments and subways. Without awareness of the changed conditions, the influence of corporateness is largely mechanical and quantitative. But when corporateness is acknowledged and understood, the quality of experience changes. Individuals will understand choices and actions in a context of associations and can begin to act intelligently.

'''4. The Lost Individual:'''
Stable individuality depends on stable objects of allegiance and clear ends of action, but these have disappeared. The past is too intellectually empty to provide guidance, and the present is too chaotic and diverse. Individuals become lost, lacking solid support, clear direction, and a unified outlook in the economic realm, in politics, in religion, in legislation, and in intellectual and artistic pursuits. Individualism taken to be private and exclusive economic gain will impede efforts to conceive the possibilities for freedom in the new corporateness and will promote confusion, detachment, and exploitation. The lost individual will only refind him or herself when traditional ideals are jettisoned, making way for a clear view of present conditions and the free exercise of imagination in conceiving a corporate society that promotes freedom for its members. 

'''5. Toward a New Individualism:'''
Individualism is not static and changes with the constitution of society. The rejection of older forms of individualism in light of a new corporateness is not a call for conformity. Individuals necessarily depend on social interaction, but there is a vital distinction between social relations that expand and deepen the meaning of those interactions and social conformity that constrains and standardizes those interactions thereby limiting meaningful experience. A new individualism will emerge when we take account of resources, including those of science and technology, and harness them not for individual pecuniary gain but for intelligent social and cultural ends that allow individuals to interact freely and meaningfully. 

'''6. Capitalistic or Public Socialism?:'''
This chapter considers the political phase of the changing character of individualism. Retaining the old notion of individualism creates confusion when considering the direction of the undeniably increasing social control of economic matters. Political leaders decry bureaucracy and laud individualism as the source of prosperity while also initiating social control of economic matters. This obscures the question referred to in the chapter title of whether this social control will consist of haphazard responses to events that threaten business aimed at pecuniary profit or else from public and intelligent planning aimed at ordered social development. The chapter accepts [[economic determinism]] as a fact and regards politics as secondary. Politics is a means, and acknowledged as such attention then can be paid to the ends it serves.

'''7. The Crisis in Culture:'''
The American pecuniary culture hinders the growth of reason and the social nature of man in three ways: mentally, because of the formative effect of turning people into mindless parts of a machine in their work; Materially, because of inadequate distribution of wealth; and by corrupting education, because education too often directed only towards obtaining a job and not learning for the sake of learning.

'''8. Individuality in Our Day:'''
Man needs to reexamine his old beliefs such as science and religion being ends in themselves.  Man should then realize that all things need to be directed towards social ends, not selfish ends such as profit.  He closes with a metaphor that new individualism is each cultivating his own garden without a fence, because the garden is the world and how he participates in its being.

'''Ineffability''' is concerned with [[idea]]s that cannot or should not be expressed in spoken words (or language in general), often being in the form of a [[taboo]] or incomprehensible term. This property is commonly associated with [[philosophy]], [[ontology|aspects of existence]], and similar concepts that are inherently "too great", complex or abstract to be communicated adequately. A typical example is the name of [[God in Judaism]], written as [[YHWH]] but substituted with "the Lord" or "[[HaShem]]" (the name) when reading.

In addition, [[logic|illogical]] statements, principles, reasons and arguments may be considered intrinsically ineffable along with [[Logical possibility|impossibilities]], contradictions and paradoxes. Terminology describing the nature of [[experience]] cannot be conveyed properly in dualistic [[symbol]]ic language; it is believed that this knowledge is only held by the individual from which it originates. [[Profanity]] and [[vulgarism]]s can easily and clearly be stated, but by those who believe they should not be said, they are considered ineffable. Thus, one method of describing something that is ineffable is by using [[apophasis]], i.e. describing what it is ''not'', rather than what it ''is''. The architect Le Corbusier described his design for the interior of the Chapel of Notre Dame du Haut at Ronchamp as ''L'espace indicible'' translated to mean 'ineffable space', a spiritual experience which was difficult to describe.

'''Interdisciplinarity''' or interdisciplinary studies involves the combining of two or more [[Discipline (academia)|academic disciplines]] into one activity (e.g., a research project).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nissani|first=M|date=1995|title=Fruits, Salads, and Smoothies: A Working definition of Interdisciplinarity|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/23767672|journal=The Journal of educational Thought (JET)/revue de La Pensée Éducative|volume=29(2)|pages=121-128|via=JSTOR}}&lt;/ref&gt; It draws knowledge from several other fields like sociology, anthropology, psychology, economics etc.  It is about creating something by thinking across boundaries. It is related to an ''[[interdiscipline]]'' or an ''interdisciplinary field,'' which is an organizational unit that crosses traditional boundaries between [[Outline of academic disciplines|academic disciplines]] or [[School of thought|schools of thought]], as new needs and professions emerge. Large [[engineering]] teams are usually interdisciplinary, as a [[power station]] or [[mobile phone]] or other project requires the melding of several specialties. However, the term "interdisciplinary" is sometimes confined to academic settings.

The term ''interdisciplinary'' is applied within education and training pedagogies to describe studies that use methods and insights of several established disciplines or traditional fields of study. Interdisciplinarity involves researchers, students, and teachers in the goals of connecting and integrating several academic schools of thought, professions, or technologies—along with their specific perspectives—in the pursuit of a common task. The [[epidemiology]] of [[HIV/AIDS]] or [[global warming]] requires understanding of diverse disciplines to solve complex problems. ''Interdisciplinary'' may be applied where the subject is felt to have been neglected or even misrepresented in the traditional disciplinary structure of research institutions, for example, [[women's studies]] or ethnic area studies. Interdisciplinarity can likewise be applied to complex subjects that can only be understood by combining the perspectives of two or more fields.

The [[adjective]] ''interdisciplinary'' is most often used in educational circles when researchers from two or more disciplines pool their approaches and modify them so that they are better suited to the problem at hand, including the case of the team-taught course where students are required to understand a given subject in terms of multiple traditional disciplines.  For example, the subject of [[land use]] may appear differently when examined by different disciplines, for instance, [[biology]], [[chemistry]], [[economics]], [[geography]], and [[politics]].

==Development==
Although “interdisciplinary” and “interdisciplinarity” are frequently viewed as twentieth century terms, the concept has historical antecedents, most notably [[Greek philosophy]].&lt;ref name="ausburg"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ausburg, Tanya|title=Becoming Interdisciplinary: An Introduction to Interdisciplinary Studies|edition=2nd |location= New York|publisher=Kendall/Hunt Publishing|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Julie Thompson Klein]] attests that "the roots of the concepts lie in a number of ideas that resonate through modern discourse—the ideas of a unified science, general knowledge, synthesis and the integration of knowledge",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Klein, Julie Thompson|title=Interdisciplinarity: History, Theory, and Practice|location=Detroit|publisher=Wayne State University|year=1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; while Giles Gunn says that [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] [[historians]] and [[Playwright|dramatists]] took elements from other realms of knowledge (such as [[medicine]] or [[philosophy]]) to further understand their own material.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Gunn, Giles|chapter=Interdisciplinary Studies|editor=Gibaldi, J.|title= Introduction to Scholarship in Modern Language and Literatures|location=New York|publisher=Modern Language Association|year=1992|pp=239–240|isbn= 978-0873523851}}&lt;/ref&gt; The building of [[Roman roads]] required men who understood [[surveying]], [[material science]], [[logistics]] and several other disciplines. Any broadminded humanist project involves interdisciplinarity, and history shows a crowd of cases, as seventeenth-century Leibniz's task to create a system of universal justice, which required linguistics, economics, management, ethics, law philosophy, politics, and even sinology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=José Andrés-Gallego|title=Are Humanism and Mixed Methods Related? Leibniz's Universal (Chinese) Dream|journal=Journal of Mixed Methods Research|volume=29|issue=2|year=2015|pages=118–132|url=http://mmr.sagepub.com/content/9/2/118.abstract|doi=10.1177/1558689813515332}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Interdisciplinary programs sometimes arise from a shared conviction that the traditional disciplines are unable or unwilling to address an important problem. For example, social science disciplines such as [[anthropology]] and [[sociology]] paid little attention to the social analysis of [[technology]] throughout most of the twentieth century. As a result, many social scientists with interests in technology have joined [[science, technology and society]] programs, which are typically staffed by scholars drawn from numerous disciplines. They may also arise from new research developments, such as [[nanotechnology]], which cannot be addressed without combining the approaches of two or more disciplines. Examples include [[quantum information processing]], an amalgamation of [[quantum physics]] and [[computer science]], and [[bioinformatics]], combining [[molecular biology]] with computer science. [[Sustainable development]] as a research area deals with problems requiring analysis and synthesis across economic, social and environmental spheres; often an integration of multiple social and natural science disciplines. Interdisciplinary research is also key to the study of health sciences, for example in studying optimal solutions to diseases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=J.S. Edge|author2=S.J. Hoffman|author3=C.L. Ramirez|author4=S.J.

At another level, interdisciplinarity is seen as a remedy to the harmful effects of excessive specialization and isolation in [[information silo]]s. On some views, however, interdisciplinarity is entirely indebted to those who specialize in one field of study—that is, without specialists, interdisciplinarians would have no information and no leading experts to consult. Others place the focus of interdisciplinarity on the need to transcend disciplines, viewing excessive specialization as problematic both epistemologically and politically. When interdisciplinary collaboration or research results in new solutions to problems, much information is given back to the various disciplines involved. Therefore, both disciplinarians and interdisciplinarians may be seen in complementary relation to one another.

==Barriers==
Because most participants in interdisciplinary ventures were trained in traditional disciplines, they must learn to appreciate differing of perspectives and methods. For example, a discipline that places more emphasis on quantitative "rigor" may produce practitioners who think of themselves (and their discipline) as "more scientific" than others; in turn, colleagues in "softer" disciplines may associate quantitative approaches with an inability to grasp the broader dimensions of a problem. An interdisciplinary program may not succeed if its members remain stuck in their disciplines (and in disciplinary attitudes). On the other hand, and from the disciplinary perspective, much interdisciplinary work may be seen as "soft", lacking in rigor, or ideologically motivated; these beliefs place barriers in the career paths of those who choose interdisciplinary work.  For example, interdisciplinary grant applications are often refereed by [[peer review]]ers drawn from established [[Academic discipline|disciplines]]; not surprisingly, interdisciplinary researchers may experience difficulty getting funding for their research. In addition, untenured researchers know that, when they seek [[promotion (rank)|promotion]] and [[tenure]], it is likely that some of the evaluators will lack commitment to interdisciplinarity. They may fear that making a commitment to interdisciplinary research will increase the risk of being denied tenure.

Interdisciplinary programs may fail if they are not given sufficient autonomy. For example, interdisciplinary faculty are usually recruited to a [[joint appointment]], with responsibilities in both an interdisciplinary program (such as [[women's studies]]) and a traditional discipline (such as [[history]]). If the traditional discipline makes the tenure decisions, new interdisciplinary faculty will be hesitant to commit themselves fully to interdisciplinary work. Other barriers include the generally disciplinary orientation of most scholarly journals, leading to the perception, if not the fact, that interdisciplinary research is hard to publish. In addition, since traditional budgetary practices at most universities channel resources through the disciplines, it becomes difficult to account for a given scholar or teacher's salary and time. During periods of budgetary contraction, the natural tendency to serve the primary constituency (i.e., students majoring in the traditional discipline) makes resources scarce for teaching and research comparatively far from the center of the discipline as traditionally understood. For these same reasons, the introduction of new interdisciplinary programs is often resisted because it is perceived as a competition for diminishing funds.

Due to these and other barriers, interdisciplinary research areas are strongly motivated to become disciplines themselves. If they succeed, they can establish their own research funding programs and make their own tenure and promotion decisions. In so doing, they lower the risk of entry. Examples of former interdisciplinary research areas that have become disciplines, many of them named for their parent disciplines, include [[neuroscience]], [[cybernetics]], [[biochemistry]] and [[biomedical engineering]]. These new fields are occasionally referred to as "interdisciplines". On the other hand, even though interdisciplinary activities are now a focus of attention for institutions promoting learning and teaching, as well as organizational and social entities concerned with education, they are practically facing complex barriers, serious challenges and criticism. The most important obstacles and challenges faced by interdisciplinary activities in the past two decades can be divided into "professional", "organizational", and "cultural" obstacles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Khorsandi Taskoh, Ali|title=Interdisciplinary Higher Education; Criticism, Challenges and Obstacles|url=http://ir.lib.uwo.ca/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1014&amp;context=researchday|date=18 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interdisciplinary studies and studies of interdisciplinarity==
An initial distinction should be made between interdisciplinary studies, which can be found spread across the academy today, and the study of interdisciplinarity, which involves a much smaller group of researchers. The former is instantiated in thousands of research centers across the US and the world. The latter has one US organization, the Association for Interdisciplinary Studies&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.units.muohio.edu/aisorg/|title=Association for Interdisciplinary Studies Homepage - Association for Interdisciplinary Studies - Oakland University|website=www.units.muohio.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; (founded in 1979), two international organizations, the International Network of Inter- and Transdisciplinarity&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inidtd.org/|title=INIT-Home|website=www.inidtd.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; (founded in 2010) and the Philosophy of/as Interdisciplinarity Network&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pin-net.gatech.edu/|title=PIN / HOME|website=pin-net.gatech.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; (founded in 2009), and one research institute devoted to the theory and practice of interdisciplinarity, the Center for the Study of Interdisciplinarity at the University of North Texas (founded in 2008). As of September 1, 2014, the Center for the Study of Interdisciplinarity has ceased to exist. This is the result of administrative decisions at the University of North Texas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=University of Texas|title=Center for the Study of Interdisciplinarity|url=https://webarchive.library.unt.edu/unt/csid/20140911224746/http://csid.unt.edu/news.html#closing|website=University of Texas|publisher=University of Texas|accessdate=26 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''interdisciplinary study''' is an academic program or process seeking to synthesize broad [[perspective (cognitive)|perspectives]], knowledge, skills, interconnections, and [[epistemology]] in an educational setting. Interdisciplinary programs may be founded in order to facilitate the study of subjects which have some coherence, but which cannot be adequately understood from a single disciplinary perspective (for example, women's studies or [[medievalism|medieval studies]]). More rarely, and at a more advanced level, interdisciplinarity may itself become the focus of study, in a critique of institutionalized disciplines' ways of segmenting knowledge.

In contrast, '''studies of interdisciplinarity''' raise to self-consciousness questions about how interdisciplinarity works, the nature and history of disciplinarity, and the future of knowledge in [[post-industrial society]]. Researchers at the Center for the Study of Interdisciplinarity have made the distinction between philosophy 'of' and 'as' interdisciplinarity, the former identifying a new, discrete area within philosophy that raises epistemological and metaphysical questions about the status of interdisciplinary thinking, with the latter pointing toward a philosophical practice that is sometimes called 'field philosophy'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/11/23/experiments-in-field-philosophy/?_r=0 | title=Experiments of Field Psychology | work=Opinionator | date=November 23, 2010 | accessdate=July 30, 2016 | author=Frodeman, Robert}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Frodeman | first1 = Robert | last2 = Briggle | first2 = Adam | last3 = Holbrook | first3 = J.

Perhaps the most common complaint regarding interdisciplinary programs, by supporters and detractors alike, is the lack of synthesis—that is, students are provided with multiple disciplinary perspectives, but are not given effective guidance in resolving the conflicts and achieving a coherent view of the subject. Others have argued that the very idea of synthesis or integration of disciplines presupposes questionable politico-epistemic commitments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Holbrook | first1 = J. Britt | year = | title = What is interdisciplinary communication?

While much has been written on the philosophy and promise of interdisciplinarity in academic programs and professional practice, social scientists are increasingly interrogating academic discourses on interdisciplinarity, as well as how interdisciplinarity actually works—and does not—in practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Barry, A.|author2=G.

=== Politics of interdisciplinary studies ===

Since 1998, there has been an ascendancy in the value of interdisciplinary research and teaching and a growth in the number of bachelor's degrees awarded at U.S. universities classified as multi- or interdisciplinary studies.  The number of interdisciplinary bachelor's degrees awarded annually rose from 7,000 in 1973 to 30,000 a year by 2005 according to data from the National Center of Educational Statistics (NECS). In addition, educational leaders from the Boyer Commission to Carnegie's President [[Vartan Gregorian]] to [[Alan I. Leshner]], CEO of the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]] have advocated for interdisciplinary rather than disciplinary approaches to problem solving in the 21st century.  This has been echoed by federal funding agencies, particularly the [[National Institutes of Health]] under the direction of [[Elias Zerhouni]], who has advocated that grant proposals be framed more as interdisciplinary collaborative projects than single researcher, single discipline ones.

At the same time, many thriving longstanding bachelor's in interdisciplinary studies programs in existence for 30 or more years, have been closed down, in spite of healthy enrollment. Examples include Arizona International (formerly part of the [[University of Arizona]]), the School of Interdisciplinary Studies at [[Miami University]], and the Department of Interdisciplinary Studies at [[Wayne State University]]; others such as the Department of Interdisciplinary Studies at [[Appalachian State University]], and [[George Mason University]]'s [[New Century College]], have been cut back. Stuart Henry{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} has seen this trend as part of the [[hegemony]] of the disciplines in their attempt to recolonize the experimental knowledge production of otherwise marginalized fields of inquiry. This is due to threat perceptions seemingly based on the ascendancy of interdisciplinary studies against traditional academia.

==Historical examples==
There are many examples of when a particular idea, almost on the same period, arises in different disciplines. One case is the shift from the approach of focusing on "specialized segments of attention" (adopting one particular perspective), to the idea of "instant sensory awareness of the whole", an attention to the "total field", a "sense of the whole pattern, of form and function as a unity", an "integral idea of structure and configuration". This has happened in painting (with [[cubism]]), physics, poetry, communication and [[educational theory]]. According to [[Marshall McLuhan]], this [[paradigm shift]] was due to the passage from an era shaped by [[mechanization]], which brought sequentiality, to the era shaped by the instant speed of electricity, which brought simultaneity.&lt;ref&gt;[[Marshall McLuhan]] (1964) ''[[Understanding Media]]'', p.13 {{cite web |url=http://www9.georgetown.edu/faculty/irvinem/theory/McLuhan-Understanding_Media-I-1-7.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-09-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011132326/http://www9.georgetown.edu/faculty/irvinem/theory/McLuhan-Understanding_Media-I-1-7.html |archivedate=11 October 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Efforts to simplify and defend the concept ==
An article in the ''Social Science Journal''&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nissani|first=M.|date=1997|title=Ten cheers for interdisciplinarity: The Case for Interdisciplinary Knowledge and Research|url=|journal=Social Science Journal|volume=34|pages=201–216|issue=2|doi=10.1016/S0362-3319(97)90051-3|pmid=}}&lt;/ref&gt; attempts to provide a simple, common-sense, definition of interdisciplinarity, bypassing the difficulties of defining that concept and obviating the need for such related concepts as [[transdisciplinarity]], [[pluridisciplinarity]], and [[multidisciplinarity]]:&lt;blockquote&gt;"To begin with, a discipline can be conveniently defined as any comparatively self-contained and isolated domain of human experience which possesses its own community of experts. Interdisciplinarity is best seen as bringing together distinctive components of two or more disciplines. In academic discourse, interdisciplinarity typically applies to four realms: knowledge, research, education, and theory. Interdisciplinary knowledge involves familiarity with components of two or more disciplines. Interdisciplinary research combines components of two or more disciplines in the search or creation of new knowledge, operations, or artistic expressions. Interdisciplinary education merges components of two or more disciplines in a single program of instruction. Interdisciplinary theory takes interdisciplinary knowledge, research, or education as its main objects of study."&lt;/blockquote&gt;In turn, interdisciplinary ''richness'' of any two instances of knowledge, research, or education can be ranked by weighing four variables: number of disciplines involved, the "distance" between them, the novelty of any particular combination, and their extent of integration.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nissani|first=M.|date=1995|title=Fruits, Salads, and Smoothies:  A Working Definition of Interdisciplinarity|url=http://www.uta.edu/faculty/repko/INTS_4391/SMOOTHIE.htm|journal=Journal of Educational Thought|volume=29|pages=119–126|issue=2|doi=|pmid=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Interdisciplinary knowledge and research are important because:
#"Creativity often requires interdisciplinary knowledge.
#Immigrants often make important contributions to their new field.
#Disciplinarians often commit errors which can be best detected by people familiar with two or more disciplines.
#Some worthwhile topics of research fall in the interstices among the traditional disciplines.
#Many intellectual, social, and practical problems require interdisciplinary approaches.
#Interdisciplinary knowledge and research serve to remind us of the unity-of-knowledge ideal.
#Interdisciplinarians enjoy greater flexibility in their research.
#More so than narrow disciplinarians, interdisciplinarians often treat themselves to the intellectual equivalent of traveling in new lands.
#Interdisciplinarians may help breach communication gaps in the modern academy, thereby helping to mobilize its enormous intellectual resources in the cause of greater social rationality and justice.
#By bridging fragmented disciplines, interdisciplinarians might play a role in the defense of academic freedom."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8712">'''Jennifer Saul''' is a [[philosopher]] working in [[philosophy of language]] and [[feminist philosophy|philosophy of feminism]]. Saul is a professor of philosophy at the [[University of Sheffield]].

==Biography==
Jennifer Saul holds a bachelor's degree from the [[University of Rochester]] and a master's degree and PhD from [[Princeton University]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.shef.ac.uk/philosophy/staff/profiles/saul&lt;/ref&gt; where she studied under [[Scott Soames]].

Saul has recently co-written a report for the [[British Philosophical Association]] and [[Society for Women in Philosophy]] UK  with [[Helen Beebee]] titled Women in Philosophy in the UK: A Report.&lt;ref&gt;http://swipuk.org/notices/2011-09-08/Women%20in%20Philosophy%20in%20the%20UK%20(BPA-SWIPUK%20Report).pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Saul frequently writes comments on women in philosophy, in a variety of non-academic publications.&lt;ref&gt;http://philosophypress.co.uk/?p=1079&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/news/male-domination-of-philosophy-must-end/2002324.article&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2011/12/12/women-job-candidates-philosophy-appalled-smoker&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/03/arts/colin-mcginn-philosopher-to-leave-his-post.html?_r=0 | work=The New York Times | first=Jennifer | last=Schuessler | title=A Star Philosopher Falls, and a Debate Over Sexism Is Set Off | date=2013-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Distinguished Woman Philosopher Award==
In December 2011, Jennifer Saul was awarded the Distinguished Woman Philosopher award in Washington, D.C. by the [[Society for Women in Philosophy]]. In response to  her Distinguished Woman Philosopher Award Saul said, "I'm deeply honored and absolutely stunned by this. It’s especially wonderful to be recognized as making a difference in people's lives by doing philosophy. For me, that's the highest honor there could be."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.shef.ac.uk/faculty/arts-and-humanities/news/2011/jenny-saul&lt;/ref&gt;  Saul is co-founder and co-blogger for the Feminists Philosophers &lt;ref&gt;http://feministphilosophers.wordpress.com&lt;/ref&gt; which is a forum that focuses on gender biases.  The forum's Gender Conference Campaign &lt;ref&gt;http://feministphilosophers.wordpress.com/gendered-conference-campaign/&lt;/ref&gt; aims to highlight the lack of participation and representation of female philosophers at world events.

==Research areas==
Saul's primary research is in analytic philosophy of language and feminist philosophy.  In her most recent book, ''Lying, Misleading and What is Said: An Exploration in Philosophy of Language and in Ethics'' (Oxford University Press 2012), she argues that the distinction between lying and misleading is theoretically significant and illuminates a variety of issues in philosophy of language concerning semantic content, implicature, and assertion.  Moreover, because it is also an ethically meaningful distinction, it demonstrates some ways in which communication and speech are apt for ethical analysis.  Saul argues that it is not the case, in general, that lying is ethically worse than misleading.  Luvell Anderson, in his review of the book, says that "Her book is an excellent addition to a growing literature of what might be considered applied philosophy of language."&lt;ref name=ndpr&gt;{{cite web|last=Anderson|first=Luvell|title=Lying, Misleading, and What is Said: An Exploration in Philosophy of Language and in Ethics|url=http://ndpr.nd.edu/news/40949-lying-misleading-and-what-is-said-an-exploration-in-philosophy-of-language-and-in-ethics/|publisher=Notre Dame Philosophical Reviews|accessdate=25 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In philosophy of language, Saul is also known for her work on substitution of co-referential terms in simple sentences.&lt;ref name=Analysis&gt;{{cite web|last=Saul|first=Jennifer|title=Substitution and Simple Sentences|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1467-8284.00060/abstract/|publisher=Analysis 2003|accessdate=25 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Although it is universally accepted that substitution fails in propositional attitude contexts, Saul argues that substitution can also fail in sentences that have no psychological verbs whatsoever.  This raises questions about the semantics of names and dominant accounts of attitude reports.  In 2007, Saul published ''Simple Sentences, Substitution and Intuitions'' (Oxford University Press) in which she develops her views on these issues with attention to their methodological implications.  Jennifer Duke-Yonge says of the book, "Saul advances the study of simple sentence substitution failure by demonstrating the inadequacy of existing accounts, but perhaps more importantly this book brings into focus crucial questions about the problematic role of semantic intuitions, frequently used without question in philosophy of language. In an area like philosophy of language where intuitions are often the primary kind of data we have available, this focused study of their role and nature is to be welcomed." &lt;ref name=Analysis2&gt;{{cite web|last=Duke-Yonge|first=Jennifer|title=Simple Sentences, Substitution and Intuitions|url=http://analysis.oxfordjournals.org/content/69/1/174.extract|publisher=Analysis 2009|accessdate=25 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[feminist philosophy]], Saul is known for her book ''Feminism: Issues &amp; Arguments'', Oxford University Press (2003), an introductory text that explores a variety of feminist views and explores their application to controversies over such topics as pornography, abortion, and veiling.  [[Louise Antony]] says, "Saul's accessible and engaging introduction to philosophical issues in feminism will challenge students of all political persuasions. Modelling good philosophical method all the way, Saul draws her readers into some of the most important and interesting controversies of contemporary gender studies."&lt;ref&gt;http://ukcatalogue.oup.com/product/9780199249473.do&lt;/ref&gt;  She has also done important work on pornography, objectification, and the history of the vibrator.

From 2011-2013, Saul was Director of the Leverhulme-funded [http://www.biasproject.org/ Implicit Bias and Philosophy International Research Project].  The project brought together nearly 100 researchers in philosophy and psychology to explore the implications of research on implicit bias and related topics for epistemology, philosophy of mind, and moral/political philosophy.

'''''Man and His Symbols''''' is the last work undertaken by [[Carl Jung]] before his death in 1961.  First published in 1964, it is divided into five parts, four of which were written by associates of Jung: [[Marie-Louise von Franz]], [[Joseph L. Henderson]], [[Aniela Jaffé]], and [[Jolande Jacobi]].  The book, which contains numerous illustrations, seeks to provide a clear explanation of Jung's complex theories for a wide non-specialist readership.

Jung wrote Part 1, "Approaching the Unconscious," of the book in English.

{{Quotation|The last year of his life was devoted almost entirely to this book, and when he died in June 1961, his own section was complete (he finished it, in fact, only some 10 days before his final illness) and his colleagues' chapters had all been approved by him in draft.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;. The chapter that bears his name is his work and (apart from some fairly extensive editing to improve its intelligibility to the general reader) nobody else's. It was written, incidentally, in English. The remaining chapters were written by the various authors to Jung's direction and under his supervision.

''John Freeman, editor, page viii of the Introduction, Dell Publishing, 1968''}}

A German-language edition of the book, ''Der Mensch und seine Symbole'', has been published by [[Walter Verlag|Patmos Verlag]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Jung |first=C.G. |date=2012 |edition=18th |title=Der Mensch und seine Symbole |location=[[Ostfildern]], Germany |publisher=Patmos Verlag |isbn=978-3-8436-0294-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The illustrations included in this edition are in color.

In the 1980s van Lambalgen did research in randomness,&lt;ref&gt;[http://staff.science.uva.nl/~michiell/docs/fFDiss.pdf Random sequences] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060529034608/http://staff.science.uva.nl/~michiell/docs/fFDiss.pdf |date=2006-05-29 }}. Unpublished PhD dissertation, Department of Mathematics and Computer Science, University of Amsterdam, 1987.&lt;/ref&gt; but after some time felt the subject was "too abstract".  Then in the 1990s he moved to [[artificial intelligence]], where he picked up the methodology for studying cognition.   In 1999 he spent a sabbatical with [[Keith Stenning]] at the [[University of Edinburgh]] where he learned about the [[psychology of reasoning]].&lt;ref&gt;See the [http://www.kent.ac.uk/secl/philosophy/jw/TheReasoner/vol2/TheReasoner-2(9).pdf interview] with van Lambalgen in [http://www.thereasoner.org/ The Reasoner].&lt;/ref&gt;  His research interests include philosophy and the foundations of mathematics, reasoning with uncertainty, the psychology of reasoning, and the cognitive semantics of natural language.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://staff.science.uva.nl/~michiell/docs/CVMvL.pdf his CV] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606062449/http://staff.science.uva.nl/~michiell/docs/CVMvL.pdf |date=2011-06-06 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3374">The '''''State of the Middle''''' ({{indic|lang=ta|indic=நடுவு நிலைமை|trans=naṭuwu nilaimai}}), refers to the virtue of impartiality, avoiding excess and preserving equity in [[Tamil people|Tamil]] philosophy. It is not to be confused with ({{indic|lang=ta|indic=நடுநிலை கொள்கை|trans=naṭunilai koḷgai}}) which refers to the ideology of [[neutralism]]{{dn|date=October 2018}}. The phrase was introduced as the name of both the concept and a chapter in the [[Tirukkuṟaḷ]] by [[Tiruvaḷḷuvar]]. It is referred to from Kurals 111 to 120. The Kural 113 summarises the concept as follows:

{{quote|Forsake in the very moment (of acquisition) that gain which, though it should bring advantage, is without equity.|Tirukkuṟaḷ, Aṟattuppāl, Illaṟaviyal, Naṭuwunilaimai, 113)}}

==Etymology==
In the [[Tamil language]], நடுவு (naṭuwu) means 'centre' and நிலை (nilai)  means 'state'; நிலைமை (nilaimai) can be roughly translated as 'the state of being at'.

==Tiruvaḷḷuvar==

[[Tiruvaḷḷuvar]] opined that the wisdom of those who follow the State of the Middle will be an unperishing example for future generations (K112). He said those who are virtuous (தக்கார்), that is follow the State of the Middle, or vicious (தகவிலர்), or those who diverge from the State of the Middle, will be known by the nature of peoples' opinion of them (K114). While life's goodness may fluctuate naturally, people are still obliged to keep the State of the Middle (K115). Should following the State of the Middle result in ones low estate, the wise shower them with praise still (K117). Suppose one should consider diverging from the State of the Middle, one should prepare for impending ruin (K116). To incline neither side like a set of scales is a sign of a virtue (K118). If one's soul is impartial, one cannot be of obliquitous promises, that is always expected to keep one's word (K119) and is expected to be impartial to friends, strangers and enemies (K111). [[Tiruvaḷḷuvar]] concludes by saying that even traders are expected to protect the goods of others as if it were their own (K120).

==Other references==

===Kaṉiyan Pūngunṟanār===
The concept has an intrinsic place in [[Tamil culture|Tamil]] society. It is referred to vaguely by [[Kaṉiyan Pūngunṟanār]] in the [[Puṟanāṉūṟu]] when he suggests it that life should neither be full of pleasure nor full of sorrow.

===Bharthiyar===
[[Bharathiyar]] makes a reference to நடுமை நிலை in his ({{indic|lang=ta|indic=குயில் பாட்டு|trans=kuyil pāṭṭu}}).

==Ancient Tamil law==
[[Manimekalai]] details that kings and judges were expected to be impartial, and measure the guilt of the offender and grant punishment accordingly without being too excessive. Any divergence from justice was said to resemble a river of milk with a water current in its course.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Iyengar|first=T. R. Sesha|title=Dravidian India|year=1982|publisher=Asian Educational Services|pages=226}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Munich Cosmic Circle''' was a group of writers and intellectuals in [[Munich]], [[Germany]] at the turn of the 20th century, based around the mystic [[Alfred Schuler]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Jung Cult: Origins of a Charismatic Movement'', By Richard Noll, p. 166-172.; ''Germany at the fin de siècle: culture, politics, and ideas'', By Suzanne L. Marchand, David F. Lindenfeld&lt;/ref&gt; Along with Schuler, it consisted of the philosopher [[Ludwig Klages]] (1872-1956), the poet [[Karl Wolfskehl]] (1869-1948) and the writer [[Ludwig Derleth]] (1870-1948).&lt;ref&gt;Where D.H. Lawrence was wrong about woman by Holbrook, David. Bucknell University Press, Associated University Presses, 1992&lt;/ref&gt; Another member of the group was the "Bohemian Countess" of [[Schwabing]], [[Fanny zu Reventlow]] (1871-1918). She wrote about her experiences with the group in her [[Roman à clef]] ''Herrn Dames Aufzeichnungen'' (1913).&lt;ref&gt;Gunna Wendt: Franziska zur Reventlow. Die anmutige Rebellin. Berlin 2008 (German)&lt;/ref&gt;

Alfred Schuler and Ludwig Klages came to know each other in 1893. With the others they based their early association upon an appreciation of [[Henrik Ibsen|Ibsen's]] dramas.&lt;ref&gt;Julia Zernack: "Nordische Mythen in der deutschen Literatur. Eddaspuren bei George und Wolfskehl", in: Annette Simonis (Hg.): ''Intermedialität und Kulturaustausch: Beobachtungen im Spannungsfeld von Künsten und Medien'', Bielefeld: transcript Verlag, 2009, S. 38. (German)&lt;/ref&gt; Another interest was the work of [[Johann Jakob Bachofen]] (1815-1887), a Swiss anthropologist and sociologist, and his research into [[matriarchal]] clans.&lt;ref&gt;''The Myth of Matriarchal Prehistory'', Cynthia Eller, esp. p. 33-34.&lt;/ref&gt; They developed a doctrine according to which the West was plagued by downfall and degeneration, caused by the rationalizing and demythologizing effects of Christianity. A way out of this desolate state could, according to the "Cosmic" view, only be found by a return to pagan origins. Schuler was described by [[Theodor Lessing]] as "an oddity, a curious mixture of charlatan and genius, a show-off and a visionary".&lt;ref&gt;Lessing, Theodore, Einmal und Nie Wieder. Bertelsmann, Guetersloh. 1969 (German)&lt;/ref&gt; The activities and rituals of the group were often sensationalized in bohemian [[fin-de-siècle]] Schwabing.

Some members of the Circle were also active in the group around the poet [[Stefan George]], whom Wolfskehl introduced to the group. Ludwig Klages wrote a book praising his poetry in 1902.&lt;ref&gt;''Secret Germany: Stefan George and his circle'' by Robert Edward Norton&lt;/ref&gt; George was not a member of the Circle, though he was in close contact with them.&lt;ref&gt;Georg Dörr: Muttermythos und Herrschaftsmythos, S.188 (German)&lt;/ref&gt; 

The group fell apart through an acrimonious dispute in 1904 between Klages, who considered himself a [[neo-pagan]] and against any form of organized religion, and the [[Zionist]] Wolfskehl, which led to charges of [[anti-semitism]] against Klages. Stefan George had also begun to distance himself from Klages' philosophy at this time and defended Wolfskehl against Schuler and Klages.&lt;ref&gt;Furness, Raymond. Zarathustra's children: a study of a lost generation of German writers, p. 95&lt;/ref&gt;

He is the Co-Chairman of the [[Center for Philosophy of Science]] and has formerly served as Chairman of the Philosophy Department.&lt;ref name=Pitt/&gt;

Rescher has served as president for the [[American Catholic Philosophical Association]], [[American G.W. Leibniz Society]], [[American Metaphysical Society]], [[American Philosophical Association]], and [[C.S. Peirce Society]],&lt;ref name="Marsonet"/&gt; He is the founder of ''[[American Philosophical Quarterly]]'',&lt;ref name="Cohenix"&gt;{{harvnb|Sosa &amp; Cohen|1979|p=ix}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[History of Philosophy Quarterly]]'', and ''[[Public Affairs Quarterly]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Kekes]] (1995). "Nicholas Rescher'', [[The Oxford Companion to Philosophy]]'', p. 771.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==
Nicholas Rescher was born in the city of [[Hagen]] in the [[Westphalia]] region of Germany.&lt;ref name="Marsonet"&gt;{{harvnb|Marsonet|2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his autobiography he traces his descent to Nehemias Rescher (1735-1801), a founder of Hochberg-Remseck Jewish community in Swabian Germany.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas Rescher, ''Autobiography: Second Edition'', Walter de Gruyter (2010), p. 308&lt;/ref&gt; He relocated to the United States when he was 10. He obtained a degree in mathematics at [[Queens College, New York]].&lt;ref name=International&gt;{{harvnb|University of Pittsburgh|2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thereafter, he attended [[Princeton University]], graduating with his Ph.D. in Philosophy in 1951 at the age of 22, the youngest person ever to have obtained a Ph.D. in that department.&lt;ref name=Pitt&gt;{{harvnb|University of Pittsburgh|2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Marsonet"/&gt; From 1952 to 1954, he served a term in the [[United States Marine Corps]], following which from 1954 to 1957 he worked for the [[Rand Corporation|Rand Corporation's]] mathematics division.&lt;ref name=International/&gt; Rescher is a cousin of the eminent orientalist [[Oskar Rescher]].

==Career==
Rescher began his career as an academic at [[Princeton University]] in 1951.&lt;ref name=International/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Princeton University|title=History - Department of Philosophy|accessdate=April 4, 2014|url=http://philosophy.princeton.edu/about/history#51-52}}&lt;/ref&gt; He joined the philosophy department at the University of Pittsburgh in 1961, becoming the first associate director of its new Center for Philosophy of Science the following year.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Center for Philosophy of Science|2001|pp=2–3}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1964, he founded the ''American Philosophical Quarterly''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|University of Illinois Press|2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1980 to 1981, Rescher served as the chairman of the philosophy department.&lt;ref name="International" /&gt; In July 1988, Rescher changed roles at the Center for Philosophy of Science, resigning as its director and becoming its co-chairman.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Center for Philosophy of Science|2001|p=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, he donated his philosophy collection to the [[Hillman Library]].&lt;ref name="International" /&gt;

An honorary member of [[Corpus Christi College, Oxford]], he has been elected to membership in the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]], the [[Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland|Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain]], the [[Academia Europaea]], the [[Royal Society of Canada]], and the [[Institut International de Philosophie]], among others.&lt;ref name="Pitt" /&gt;

Rescher is a prolific writer, with over 100 books and 400 articles, generating the jest that Rescher is not a single person, but a committee sharing the name.&lt;ref name="Marsonet"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cohenix"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Marsonetivv/&gt; Philosopher [[Michele Marsonet]], who has published extensively on Rescher's philosophy, writes that his prolific publication is in itself the most common objection against Rescher, adding "it is, indeed, a leitmotiv of all those unwilling to discuss his ideas".&lt;ref name=Marsonetivv&gt;{{harvnb|Marsonet|2008|p=iv-v}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rescher has described his own approach to philosophy as synthesizing the [[German idealism|idealism of Germany]] and [[British idealism|Great Britain]] with the [[pragmatism]] of the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jacquette|2009|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophy==
Rescher's university biography describes his philosophical work thus:&lt;ref name=Pitt/&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;His work envisions a dialectical tension between our synoptic aspirations for useful knowledge and our human limitations as finite inquirers. The elaboration of this project represents a many-sided approach to fundamental philosophical issues that weaves together threads of thought from the philosophy of science, and from continental idealism and American pragmatism.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the mid and late 1960s, his studies were focused on medieval Arabic logic, but he soon broadened his areas of inquiry in [[metaphysics]] and [[epistemology]], moving towards the [[methodological pragmatism]] he would define.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jacquette|2009|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1970s, he began working more extensively with American pragmatism with a focus on the writings of [[C. S. Peirce]], who was to number among his major influences.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jacquette|2009|pp=3–4}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1966, Rescher collaborated with Herbert A. Simon on a ground-breaking paper on the theory of causlality.&lt;ref&gt;Herbert Simon and Nicholas Rescher, "Cause and Counterfactual," ''Philosophy of Sciences'', vol. 34 (1966). pp.323-340.&lt;/ref&gt;

He has contributed to futuristics, and with [[Olaf Helmer]] and [[Norman Dalkey]], invented the [[Delphi method]] of forecasting.&lt;ref name=Pitt/&gt; A lifelong aficionado of the philosophy of G. W. Leibniz, Rescher has been instrumental in the reconstruction of Leibniz's machina deciphratoria, an ancestor of the famous Enigma cipher machine. Rescher is also responsible for two further items of historical rediscovery and reconstruction: the model of cosmic evolution in Anaximander,&lt;ref&gt;2001, Robert Hahn, ''Anaximander and the Architects'' (Albany: SUNY Press).&lt;/ref&gt; and the medieval Islamic theory of modal syllogistic.&lt;ref&gt;2000, Tony Street, "Toward a History of Syllogistic after Avicenna: A Note on Rescher's Studies in Arabid Modal Logic," ''Journal of Islamic Studies,'' vol. 11, pp. 209-28.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Honors==
Rescher has been honored many times for his work. In 1984, he received the [[Humboldt Prize]] for Humanistic Scholarship.&lt;ref name="Marsonet"/&gt; In 2005, he received the [[Cardinal Mercier Prize]], and in 2007 the American Catholic Philosophical Society's Aquinas Medal.  In 2011, his contributions as a German-American to philosophy were recognized with the premier cross of the [[Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany]], the Founder's Medal of the American Metaphysical Society (2016), and the Helmholtz Medal of the German Academy of Sciences [[Berlin-Brandenburg]].&lt;ref name=Pitt/&gt; He holds eight honorary degrees. Having held visiting lectureships at Oxford, [[University of Konstanz|Konstanz]], [[University of Salamanca|Salamanca]], [[Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich|Munich]], and [[University of Marburg|Marburg]], he has been awarded fellowships by the [[Ford Foundation|Ford]], [[Guggenheim Fellowship|Guggenheim]], and [[National Science Foundation]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s.&lt;ref name="Pitt" /&gt;

==The Nicholas Rescher Prize and Medal==
In 2010, the University of Pittsburgh created the Dr. Nicholas Rescher Fund for the Advancement of the Department of Philosophy which bestows the Nicholas Rescher Prize for Contributions to Systematic Philosophy.&lt;ref name=International/&gt; The first recipient of the prize was Rescher's former student, [[Ernest Sosa]]. As of 2012, the prize included a gold medal and $25,000, subsequently raised to $30,000. Later awardees include Alvin Plantinga, Juergen Mittelstrass, Hilary Putnam, and Ruth Millikan.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb | Anderson | 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the American Philosophical Association inaugurated its own Rescher Prize for Systematic Philosophy in 2018, the University of Pittsburgh redesignated its award as the Rescher Medal.

The '''Noncommissioned Officer's Creed''', shortened to '''NCO creed''', is a tool used in the United States to educate and remind enlisted leaders of their responsibilities and authority, and serves as a [[Code of conduct]]. Each branch has their own version, and many have been altered over the years.

==Army Creed of the Noncommissioned Officer ==
In 1973, the [[United States Army]] was in turmoil as a result of the [[Vietnam War]] drawing to an end.&lt;ref name="ArmyNCO"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ncohistory.com/articles/CreedHistory.htm|title=U.S. Army NCO Creed|work=NCOHistory.com|publisher=SGM Dan Elder and SGM Felix Sanchez|accessdate=3 May 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the conceived solutions was the "[[Modern Volunteer Army]]", which included the Noncommissioned Officer Candidate Course. Many Sergeants were trained only to perform one specific job, for example, [[squad leader]]s in infantry units, and were no longer uniformly regarded as the well-rounded professionals of previous generations.&lt;ref name="ArmyNCO" /&gt; The overhaul of the NCO Corps involved rewriting Field Manual 22–100: Leadership.

One of the organizations dedicated to rebuilding the NCO Corps was the NCO Subcommittee of the Command and Leadership Committee in the Leadership Department at the [[United States Army Infantry School]] at [[Fort Benning]]. Besides training Soldiers at the Noncommissioned Officers Academy, these NCOs also developed instructional material to be used throughout the Army. During a brainstorming session, SFC Earle Brigham and Jimmie Jakes Sr. were credited with writing on a sheet of paper the three letters "N C O",&lt;ref name="ArmyNCO" /&gt; and the committee began building a creed, a "yardstick by which to measure themselves." When it was ultimately approved, The Creed of the Noncommssioned Officer was printed on the inside cover of the special texts issued to students, beginning in 1974. Though The Creed of the Noncommissioned Officer was submitted higher for approval and distribution Army-wide, it was not formalized by an official army publication until 11 years later.&lt;ref name="ArmyNCO" /&gt;

The Army dedicated 2009 as the "Year of the NCO".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.army.mil/yearoftheNCO/creed.html NCO creed] at army.mil&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|No one is more professional than I. I am a Noncommissioned Officer, a leader of Soldiers. As a Noncommissioned Officer, I realize that I am a member of a time honored corps, which is known as “The Backbone of the Army.” I am proud of the Corps of Noncommissioned Officers, and will at all times conduct myself so as to bring credit upon the Corps, the military service, and my country; regardless of the situation in which I find myself. I will not use my grade or position to attain pleasure, profit, or personal safety.

Competence is my watch-word. My two basic responsibilities will always be uppermost in my mind: Accomplishment of my mission and the welfare of my Soldiers. I will strive to remain technically and tactically proficient. I am aware of my role as a Noncommissioned Officer, I will fulfill my responsibilities inherent in that role. All Soldiers are entitled to outstanding leadership; I will provide that leadership. I know my Soldiers, and I will always place their needs above my own. I will communicate consistently with my Soldiers, and never leave them uninformed. I will be fair and impartial when recommending both rewards and punishment.

Officers of my unit will have maximum time to accomplish their duties; they will not have to accomplish mine. I will earn their respect and confidence as well as that of my Soldiers. I will be loyal to those with whom I serve; seniors, peers, and subordinates alike. I will exercise initiative by taking appropriate action in the absence of orders. I will not compromise my integrity, nor my moral courage. I will not forget, nor will I allow my comrades to forget that we are professionals, Noncommissioned Officers, leaders!&lt;ref name="FM 7-22.7"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://armypubs.army.mil/doctrine/DR_pubs/dr_a/pdf/fm7_22x7.pdf|title=The Army Noncommissioned Officer Guide|work=Field Manual 7–22.7|publisher=Headquarters, Department of the Army|date=December 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The initial letters of each paragraph are, in order, N C O.

==='Tactically' and 'technically' discrepancy===
For almost the first 20 years, many&lt;ref name="ArmyNCO" /&gt; Army Creeds of the Noncommissioned Officer in publication had the second sentence in the second paragraph as ''I will strive to remain tactically and technically proficient.'' However, in 2001 the Army had a team of contractors who created FM 7-22.7, The Army Noncommissioned Officer Guide&lt;ref name="FM 7-22.7"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gordon.army.mil/SAMC/Downloads/TheArmyNoncommissionedOfficerGuideFM7-227.pdf|title=The Army Noncommissioned Officer Guide|work=Field Manual 7–22.7|publisher=Headquarters, Department of the Army|date=December 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; who apparently transposed the sentence to ''I will strive to remain technically and tactically proficient''. To compound the problem the [http://ncojournal.dodlive.mil/ NCO Journal] printed a story in the May 2010 edition&lt;ref name="FM 7-22.7"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://usasma.bliss.army.mil/NCOJournal/Archives/2010/May/PDFs/correctncocreed.pdf|title=What is the correct NCO Creed?|work=NCO Journal|publisher=Headquarters, Department of the Army|date=May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; which correctly identified that a field manual has precedence over other forms of publication (e.g., DA pamphlet), so it must be right. No historical research appeared to have been conducted, and it is unknown if any of the sources cited in the original research&lt;ref name="ArmyNCO" /&gt; by Elder and Sanchez were consulted.

==Marine Corps==

===NCO creed===
The NCO creed was revised in February 2006 under Navy and Marine Corps Directive 1500.58, Marine Corps Mentoring Program Guidebook.&lt;ref name="NAVMC 1500.28"&gt;{{cite web|title=NAVMC 1500.28, Appx 106, pg 83|url=http://www.marines.mil/Portals/59/Publications/NAVMC%20DIR%201500.58.pdf|website=Marines.mil|publisher=USMC|accessdate=23 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The current version is as follows:

{{quote|I am the backbone of the United States Marine Corps, I am a Marine Noncommissioned Officer. I serve as part of the vital link between my commander (and all officers) and enlisted Marines. I will never forget who I am or what I represent. I will challenge myself to the limit and be ever attentive to duty. I am now, more than ever, committed to excellence in all that I do, so that I can set the proper example for other Marines. I will demand of myself all the energy, knowledge and skills I possess, so that I can instill confidence in those I teach. I will constantly strive to perfect my own skills and to become a good leader. Above all I will be truthful in all I say or do. My integrity shall be impeccable as my appearance. I will be honest with myself, with those under my charge and with my superiors. I pledge to do my best to incorporate all the leadership traits into my character. For such is the heritage I have received from that long, illustrious line of professionals who have worn the bloodstripe so proudly before me. I must give the very best I have for my Marines, my Corps and my Country for though today I instruct and supervise in peace, tomorrow, I may lead in war.}}

The unofficial NCO creed was an excerpt from Warrior Culture of the U.S. Marines, copyright 2001 Marion F. Sturkey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Heritage Press International|url=http://www.usmcpress.com/heritage/nco_creed.htm|website=www.usmcpress.com|publisher=Heritage Press International|accessdate=23 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; That version, which is still frequently used, read:

{{quote|I am an NCO dedicated to training new Marines and influencing the old. I am forever conscious of each Marine under my charge, and by example will inspire them to the highest standards possible. I will strive to be patient, understanding, just, and firm. I will commend the deserving and encourage the wayward. I will never forget that I am responsible to my Commanding Officer for the morale, discipline, and efficiency of my Men. Their performance will reflect an image of me.&lt;ref name="Marine NCO creed"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usmcpress.com/heritage/nco_creed.htm|title=NCO Creed|work=USMC Heritage Press Foundation|publisher=Heritage Press International|accessdate=21 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sacramentomarines.com/knowledge_base/nco-creed/ NCO Creed] on [[sacramento]]marines.com&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===SNCO creed===
Because the Marine Corps emphasizes the additional responsibility upon [[Staff Noncommissioned Officer]]s, they have their own creed:&lt;ref name="SNCOcreed"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usmcpress.com/heritage/snco_creed.htm|title=Staff NCO Creed|work=USMC Heritage Press Foundation|publisher=Heritage Press International|accessdate=21 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|I am a Staff Noncommissioned Officer in the United States Marine Corps. As such, I am a member of the most unique group of professional military practitioners in the world. I am bound by duty to God, Country, and my fellow Marines to execute the demands of my position to and beyond what I believe to be the limits of my capabilities.

I realize I am the mainstay of Marine Corps discipline, and I carry myself with military grace, unbowed by the weight of command, unflinching in the execution of lawful orders, and unswerving in my dedication to the most complete success of my assigned mission.

Both my professional and personal demeanor shall be such that I may take pride if my juniors emulate me, and knowing perfection to lie beyond the grasp of any mortal hand, I shall yet strive to attain perfection that I may ever be aware of my needs and capabilities to improve myself. I shall be fair in my personal relations, just in the enforcement of discipline, true to myself and my fellow Marines, and equitable in my dealing with every man.&lt;ref name="NAVMC DIR 1500.58"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marines.mil/news/publications/Pages/NAVMC%20DIR%201500.58.aspx|title=NAVMC DIR 1500.58 Marine Corps Mentoring Program Guidebook|last=Hagee|first=Michael W.|authorlink=Michael Hagee|date=13 February 2006|publisher=United States Marine Corps|pages=83–84|accessdate=8 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Navy==
{{quote|During the course of this day, you have been caused to humbly accept challenge and face adversity. This you have accomplished with rare good grace. Pointless as some of these challenges may have seemed, there were valid, time-honored reasons behind each pointed barb. It was necessary to meet these hurdles with blind faith in the fellowship of Chief Petty Officers. The goal was to instill in you that trust is inherent with the donning of the uniform of a Chief. It was our intent to impress upon you that challenge is good; a great and necessary reality which cannot mar you ─ which, in fact, strengthens you.

In your future as a Chief Petty Officer, you will be forced to endure adversity far beyond that imposed upon you today. You must face each challenge and adversity with the same dignity and good grace you demonstrated today.


By experience, by performance, and by testing, you have been this day advanced to Chief Petty Officer. In the United States Navy ─ and only in the United States Navy ─ the rank of E7 carries with it unique responsibilities and privileges you are now bound to observe and expected to fulfill.

Your entire way of life is now changed. More will be expected of you; more will be demanded of you. Not because you are an E7 but because you are now a Chief Petty Officer. You have not merely been promoted one paygrade, you have joined an exclusive fellowship and, as in all fellowships, you have a special responsibility to your comrades, even as they have a special responsibility to you. This is why we in the United States Navy may maintain with pride our feelings of accomplishment once we have attained the position of Chief Petty Officer.

Your new responsibilities and privileges do not appear in print. They have no official standing; they cannot be referred to by name, number, nor file. They have existed for over 100 years, Chiefs before you have freely accepted responsibility beyond the call of printed assignment. Their actions and their performance demanded the respect of their seniors as well as their juniors.

It is now required that you be the fountain of wisdom, the ambassador of good will, the authority in personal relations as well as in technical applications. "Ask the Chief" is a household phrase in and out of the Navy. You are now the Chief.

The exalted position you have now achieved ─ and the word exalted is used advisedly ─ exists because of the attitude and performance of the Chiefs before you. It shall exist only as long as you and your fellow Chiefs maintain these standards.

It was our intention that you never forget this day. It was our intention to test you, to try you, and to accept you. Your performance has assured us that you will wear "the hat" with the same pride as your comrades in arms before you.

We take a deep and sincere pleasure in clasping your hand, and accepting you as a Chief Petty Officer in the United States Navy.}}

==Air Force==
The US Air Force has utilized several different creeds (the NCO Creed, the SNCO Creed, the Chief's creed,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.airforcechiefs.org/PDF/ChiefsCreed.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; the First Sergeant's Creed,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.militaryauthority.com/wiki/military-creeds/air-force-first-sergeants-creed.html&lt;/ref&gt; the Security Forces Creed, etc.).  However, as of April 2007 all the creeds used in the Air Force were replaced by The [[Airman's Creed]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CSAF presents Airman's Creed|url=http://www.seymourjohnson.af.mil/news/story.asp?id=123050352|year=2007|author=General T. Michael Moseley, Chief of Staff of the Air Force|publisher=SeymourJohnson.af.mil|accessdate=9 November 2007|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070430060157/http://www.seymourjohnson.af.mil/news/story.asp?id=123050352|archivedate=30 April 2007|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Noncommissioned Officer creed===
No one is more professional than I. I am a Noncommissioned Officer: a leader of people. I am proud of the Noncommissioned Officer corps and will, at all times, conduct myself so as to bring credit upon it. I will not use my grade or position to attain profit or safety.

So, what does this mean to me as an NCO?
What this means is, I as an NCO will continually seek to better myself by going to my career schooling and absorbing what I learn from my senior NCO's, it means that I will lead to the best of my abilities and treat all soldiers with respect, courteousness and fairness. 

Competence is my watchword. I will strive to remain tactically and technically proficient. I will always be aware of my role as a Noncommissioned Officer. I will fulfill my responsibilities and display professionalism at all times. I will strive to know my people and use their skills to the maximum degree possible. I will always place their needs above my own and will communicate with my supervisor and my people and never leave them uninformed

So, what does this mean to me as an NCO?
It means that I will do my best to be proficient in my assigned jobs and learn from past tasks, it means that I will stay cognizant of my role as an NCO and fulfill my duties to the best of my abilities and take pride in what I do, no matter how others portray my accomplishments. 
It means that I know my soldiers and know how to use them in a manner that promotes the units needs. It means that I will take care of my soldiers fairly and mentor them to become better soldiers and would not ask them to do something I wouldn't do or have not done before.
It means to me that I will keep my soldiers and senior NCO'S informed and they will keep me informed of changes and any information that pertains to me.
 
I will exert every effort and risk any ridicule to successfully accomplish my assigned duties. I will not look at a person and see any race, creed, color, religion, sex, age, or national origin, for I will only see the person; nor will I ever show prejudice or bias. I will lead by example and will resort to disciplinary action only when necessary.

SO, what does this mean to me as an NCO?
It mean I will take pride in my assigned duties and accomplish them to the best of my abilities.
It means to me that I see that person not by race, creed, color, religion, sex, age, or origin but as an individual.
It means I will treat all soldiers fairly, equally without malice or without bias.
It means to me that I will lead by example and only resort to disciplinary action when appropriate 
It means to me that I will also give positive counseling when soldiers go above their responsibilities.

 
I will carry out the orders of my superiors to the best of ability and will always obey the decisions of my superiors. I will give all officers my maximum support to ensure mission accomplishments. I will earn their respect, obey their orders, and establish a high degree of integrity with them. I will exercise initiative in the absence of orders and will make decisive and accurate decisions. I will never compromise my integrity, nor my moral courage. I will not forget that I am a Professional, a Leader, but above all a Noncommissioned Officer.

===SNCO creed===
{{quote|I am a Senior Noncommissioned Officer in the United States Air Force. I hold allegiance to my country, devotion to duty, and personal integrity above all. I wear my rank of authority with dignity, I promote the highest standards of conduct, appearance, and performance by setting the example. I seek no favors because of my rank. I am devoted to the concept of service rather than personal gain. I uphold the traditions of senior noncommissioned officers who precede me. I manage resources under my control with astute efficiency, and lead the way with the highest level of competence. I always strive to merit the respect of my fellow senior noncommissioned officers and of all with whom I come in contact.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.creedairmansmarinesoldiersailors.com/2008/09/19/snco-creed/ SNCO creed] (Air Force)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The name has ranked among the top 1,000 names given to newborn girls in the United States since 1994, when it returned to the top 1,000 for the first time since 1894. In 2011, it was the 843rd most popular name given to newborn American girls.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ssa.gov/cgi-bin/babyname.cgi&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Personhood''' is the status of being a [[person]]. Defining personhood is a controversial topic in [[philosophy]] and [[law]] and is closely tied with legal and [[political]] concepts of [[citizenship]], [[equality before the law|equality]], and [[liberty]]. According to law, only a [[natural person]] or [[legal personality]] has [[rights]], protections, privileges, responsibilities, and [[legal liability]].&lt;ref&gt;"Where it is more than simply a synonym for 'human being', 'person' figures primarily in moral and legal discourse. A person is a being with ''a certain moral status'', or a bearer of rights. But underlying the moral status, as its condition, are ''certain capacities''. A person is a being who has a sense of self, has a notion of the future and the past, can hold values, make choices; in short, can adopt life-plans. At least, a person must be the kind of being who is in principle capable of all this, however damaged these capacities may be in practice." Charles Taylor, "The Concept of a Person", ''Philosophical Papers. Volume 1.'' Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1985, 97.&lt;/ref&gt;

Personhood continues to be a topic of international debate and has been questioned critically during the abolition of human and nonhuman [[slavery]], in theology, in debates about [[abortion]] and in [[fetal rights]] and/or [[reproductive rights]], in [[animal rights]] activism, in [[theology]] and [[ontology]], in [[ethics|ethical theory]], and in debates about [[corporate personhood]] and the [[beginning of human personhood]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/22/us/politics/22scotus.html "Justices, 5–4, Reject Corporate Spending Limit"], ''The New York Times'', January 21, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Processes through which personhood is recognized socially and legally vary cross-culturally, demonstrating that notions of personhood are not universal. Anthropologist Beth Conklin has shown how personhood is tied to social relations among the [[Wari' people]] of [[Rondônia]], Brazil.&lt;ref&gt;Beth A. Conklin and Lynn M. Morgan, "Babies, Bodies, and the Production of Personhood in North America and a Native Amazonian Society," 'Ethos,' Vol. 24, No. 4 (Dec., 1996), pp. 657–694.&lt;/ref&gt; Bruce Knauft's studies of the Gebusi people of Papua New Guinea depict a context in which individuals become persons incrementally, again through social relations.&lt;ref&gt;Bruce Knauft, 'The Gebusi: Lives Transformed in a Rainforest World, 3e" New York: McGraw-Hill, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, [[Jane C. Goodale]] has also examined the construction of personhood in Papua New Guinea.&lt;ref&gt;Jane Goodale, 'To Sing With Pigs Is Human: The Concept of Person in Papua New Guinea,' Seattle: University of Washington Press, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
{{cleanup|section|reason=Various concepts of personhood are listed in no particular order with no overarching structure or organization|date=June 2012}}
Capacities or attributes common to definitions of personhood can include [[human nature]], [[agency (philosophy)|agency]], [[self-awareness]], a notion of the past and future, and the possession of [[rights]] and [[duties]], among others.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Taylor, "The Concept of a Person", ''Philosophical Papers. Volume 1.'' Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1985, 97–114.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the concept of a person is difficult to define in a way that is universally accepted, due to its historical and cultural variability and the controversies surrounding its use in some contexts.

===Western philosophy&lt;!--linked from 'Functionalism (philosophy of mind)'--&gt;===
In philosophy, the word "person" may refer to various concepts. According to the "naturalist" [[epistemology|epistemological]] tradition, from [[Descartes]] through [[John Locke|Locke]] and [[David Hume|Hume]], the term may designate any human (or [[Non human|non-human]]) [[Agency (philosophy)|agent]] who: (1) possesses continuous [[consciousness]] over time; and (2) who is therefore capable of framing representations about the world, formulating plans and acting on them.&lt;ref&gt;[[Charles Taylor (philosopher)|Charles Taylor]], "The Concept of a Person", Philosophical Papers. Volume 1. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1985, 97–114&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Charles Taylor (philosopher)|Charles Taylor]], the problem with the naturalist view is that it depends solely on a "performance criterion" to determine what is an agent. Thus, other things (e.g. machines or animals) that exhibit "similarly complex adaptive behaviour" could not be distinguished from persons. Instead, Taylor proposes a significance-based view of personhood:

{{quote|What is crucial about agents is that things matter to them. We thus cannot simply identify agents by a performance criterion, nor assimilate animals to machines... [likewise] there are matters of significance for human beings which are peculiarly human, and have no analogue with animals.|&lt;ref&gt;[[Charles Taylor (philosopher)|Charles Taylor]], "The Concept of a Person", Philosophical Papers. Volume 1. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1985, 98–102&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Others, such as American Philosopher [[Francis J. Beckwith]], argue that personhood is not linked to function at all, but rather that it is the underlying personal unity of the individual.

{{quote|What is crucial morally is the being of a person, not his or her functioning.  A human person does not come into existence when human function arises, but rather, a human person is an [[entity]] who has the natural inherent capacity to give rise to human functions, whether or not those functions are ever attained.  …A human person who lacks the ability to think [[Rationality|rationally]] (either because she is too young or she suffers from a disability) is still a human person because of her nature.  Consequently, it makes sense to speak of a human being’s lack if and only if she is an actual person.|2=&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Beckwith|first=Francis J.|title=Abortion, Bioethics, and Personhood: A Philosophical Reflection|url=http://www.personhoodkansas.com/files/Keith%20Ashley/AbortionBioethicsandPersonhood.pdf|publisher=The Southern Baptist Theological Seminary|accessdate=23 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Philosopher [[J. P. Moreland]] clarifies this point:

{{quote|It is because an entity has an essence and falls within a natural kind that it can possess a unity of dispositions, capacities, parts and properties at a given time and can maintain identity through change.|2=&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Moreland|first=J.

[[Harry G. Frankfurt]] writes that, "What philosophers have lately come to accept as analysis of the concept of a person is not actually analysis of ''that'' concept at all." He suggests that the concept of a person is intimately connected to [[free will]], and describes the structure of human [[volition (psychology)|volition]] according to first- and second-order desires:

{{quote|Besides wanting and choosing and being moved ''to do'' this or that, [humans] may also want to have (or not to have) certain desires and motives. They are capable of wanting to be different, in their preferences and purposes, from what they are. Many animals appear to have the capacity for what I shall call "first-order desires" or "desires of the first order," which are simply desires to do or not to do one thing or another. No animal other than man, however, appears to have the capacity for reflective self-evaluation that is manifested in the formation of second-order desires.|&lt;ref&gt;Harry G. Frankfurt, "Freedom of the Will and the Concept of a Person", ''The Journal of Philosophy'', Vol. 68, No.1 (Jan 14, 1971), 5–7.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;P.G Ossorio, The Behavior Of Persons, Ann Arbor: Descriptive Psychology Press, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;{{quote|The criteria for being a person... are designed to capture those attributes which are the subject of our most humane concern with ourselves and the source of what we regard as most important and most problematical in our lives.|Harry G. Frankfurt}}{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}}

According to [[Nikolas Kompridis]], there might also be an [[intersubjectivity|intersubjective]], or interpersonal, basis to personhood:

{{quote|What if personal identity is constituted in, and sustained through, our relations with others, such that were we to erase our relations with our significant others we would also erase the conditions of our self-intelligibility? As it turns out, this erasure... is precisely what is experimentally dramatized in the “science fiction” film, ''[[Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind]]'', a far more philosophically sophisticated meditation on personal identity than is found in most of the contemporary literature on the topic.|&lt;ref&gt;Nikolas Kompridis, [http://www.parrhesiajournal.org/parrhesia08/parrhesia08_kompridis.pdf "Technology's Challenge to Democracy: What of the Human?", ''Parrhesia'' 8 (2009)], 27.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Other philosophers have defined persons in different ways. [[Boethius]] gives the definition of "person" as "an individual substance of a rational nature" ("''Naturæ rationalis individua substantia''").&lt;ref name="CathEnc"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Geddes|first=Leonard|title=Person|encyclopedia=[[Catholic Encyclopedia]]|publisher=Robert Appleton Company|location=New York|year=1911|volume=11|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11726a.htm|accessdate=2011-03-09|quote=The Latin word persona was originally used to denote the mask worn by an actor. From this it was applied to the role he assumed, and, finally, to any character on the stage of life, to any individual.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mary Midgley defines a “person” as being a conscious, thinking being, which knows that it is a person ([[self-awareness]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.animal-rights-library.com/texts-m/midgley01.htm "Persons and non-persons"], in Peter Singer (ed), ''In Defense of Animals''. Basil Blackwell, 1985, pp. 52–62.&lt;/ref&gt;

Philosopher Thomas I. White argues that the criteria for a person are as follows: (1) is alive, (2) is aware, (3) feels positive and negative sensations, (4) has emotions, (5) has a sense of self, (6) controls its own behaviour, (7) recognises other persons and treats them appropriately, and (8) has a variety of sophisticated cognitive abilities. While many of White's criteria are somewhat [[Anthropocentrism|anthropocentric]], some animals such as [[dolphin]]s would still be considered persons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.philosophypress.co.uk/?p=1279 |title=Dolphin people |author=Thomas I. White |date=June 2, 2010 |accessdate=9 December 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some animal rights groups have also championed recognition for animals as "persons".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oxfordanimalethics.com/2010/01/fellow-champions-dolphins-as-%E2%80%9Cnon-human-persons%E2%80%9D/ Fellow Champions Dolphins as “Non-Human Persons”], Oxford Centre for Animal Ethics, January 10, 2010; Midgley, Mary.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another approach to personhood, Paradigm Case Formulation, used in [[Descriptive psychology|Descriptive Psychology]] and developed by [[Peter Ossorio]], involves the four interrelated concepts of 1) The Individual Person, 2) Deliberate Action, 3) Reality and the Real World, and 4) Language or Verbal Behavior.  All four concepts require full articulation for any one of them to be fully intelligible. More specifically,  a Person is an individual whose history is, paradigmatically, a history of Deliberate Action in a Dramaturgical pattern. Deliberate Action is a form of behavior in which a person (a) engages in an Intentional Action, (b) is cognizant of that, and (c) has chosen to do that.  A person is not always engaged in a deliberate action but has the eligibility to do so.  A human being is an individual who is both a person and a specimen of Homo sapiens. Since persons are deliberate actors, they also employ hedonic, prudent, aesthetic and ethical reasons when selecting, choosing or deciding on a course of action. As part of our "social contract" we expect that the typical person can make use of all four of these motivational perspectives. Individual persons will weigh these motives in a manner that reflects their personal characteristics.  That life is lived in a “dramaturgical” pattern is to say that people make sense, that their lives have patterns of significance. The paradigm case allows for nonhuman persons, potential persons, nascent persons, manufactured persons, former persons, "deficit case" persons, and "primitive" persons. By using a paradigm case methodology, different observers can point to where they agree and where they disagree about whether an entity qualifies as a person.&lt;ref&gt;P. G.

===American law===
{{see also|US person}}
A person is recognized by law as such, not because they are human, but because rights and duties are ascribed to them. The person is the legal subject or substance of which the rights and duties are attributes. An individual human being considered to be having such attributes is what lawyers call a "natural person."&lt;ref&gt;Pollock, First Book of Jurispr. 110. Gray, Nature and Sources of Law, ch. II. Black's Law Dictionary, 4th Edition, p 1300&lt;/ref&gt; According to Black's Law Dictionary,&lt;ref&gt;Black's Law Dictionary, 5th edition, citing the National Labor Relations Act, section 2(1)&lt;/ref&gt; a person is:

{{quote|In general usage, a human being (i.e. [[natural person]]), though by statute term may include a firm, labor organizations, partnerships, associations, corporations, legal representatives, trustees, trustees in bankruptcy, or receivers.}}

In Federal law, the concept of legal personhood is formalized by statute (1 [[United_States_Code|USC]] §8) as a "member of the species homo sapiens who is born alive at any stage of development."

As an application of [[social psychology]] and other disciplines, phenomena such as the ''perception'' and ''attribution'' of personhood have been scientifically studied.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Person Perception.

Various specific debates focus on questions about the personhood of different classes of entities.

====Beginning of personhood====
{{for|full article|Beginning of human personhood}}

The [[beginning of human personhood]] is a concept long debated by religion and philosophy.  With respect to [[abortion]], 'personhood' is the status of a human being having individual human rights. The term was used by Justice Blackmun in ''[[Roe v. Wade]]''.&lt;ref name="ROE V. WADE, 410 U. S. 113 1973"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://supreme.justia.com/us/410/113/case.html |title=ROE V. WADE, 410 U. S. 113 (1973)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:PersonhoodSupremeCourt.JPG|250px|thumb|Personhood protest in front of the [[United States Supreme Court]]]]

A political movement in the United States seeks to define the [[beginning of human personhood]] as starting from the moment of [[fertilisation|fertilization]] with the result being that abortion, as well as forms of birth control that act to deprive the human embryo of necessary sustenance in [[implantation (human embryo)|implantation]], could become illegal.&lt;ref name="Huffpo-Bassett-2011-11-08"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/11/08/personhood-abortion-bans-_n_1082344.html|title='Personhood' Anti-Abortion Movement Gains National Momentum|publisher=Huffington Post|accessdate=2011-11-09|date=2011-11-08|author=Laura Bassett}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.wustl.edu/news/Pages/22935.aspx|title=Numerous flaws in ‘personhood’ movement, says family law expert|date=November 7, 2011|publisher=Washington University in St. Louis|accessdate=2011-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Supporters of the movement also state that it would have some effect on the practice of [[in-vitro fertilisation|in-vitro fertilization]] (IVF), but would not lead to the practice being outlawed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Will Mississippi Ban IVF?|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2011/10/24/personhood-ballot-initiative-in-mississippi-could-ban-some-ivf-practices.html|publisher=The Daily Beast|date=October 24, 2011|author=Michelle Goldberg}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jonathan F. Will says that the personhood framework could produce significant restrictions on IVF to the extent that reproductive clinics find it impossible to provide the services.&lt;ref&gt;Will, Jonathan F.

(Boston: American Society of Law and Medicine) 39 (4): 601–602. {{ISSN|0098-8588}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A representative organization within this movement is Personhood USA, a [[Colorado]]-based [[umbrella group]] with a number of state-level affiliates,&lt;ref name="Bloomberg-Deprez-2011-11-04"&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-11-04/toughest-u-s-abortion-law-nears-passage-in-mississippi-vote.html|title=Toughest U.S. Abortion Law Nears Passage in Mississippi Vote|author=Esmé E.

Proponents of the movement regard personhood as an attempt to directly challenge the ''Roe v. Wade'' [[United States Supreme Court|U.S. Supreme Court]] decision, thus filling a legal void left by [[Harry Blackmun|Justice Harry Blackmun]] in the majority opinion when he wrote: “If this suggestion of personhood is established, the appellant’s case, of course, collapses, for the fetus’ right to life would then be guaranteed specifically by the Amendment.”&lt;ref name="ROE V. WADE, 410 U. S. 113 1973" /&gt;

Some medical organizations have described the potential effects of personhood legislation as potentially harmful to patients and the practice of medicine, particularly in the cases of [[ectopic pregnancy|ectopic]] and [[molar pregnancy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-503544_162-57318625-503544/doctors-call-mississippi-personhood-initiative-dangerous/|title=Doctors call Mississippi "personhood" initiative dangerous|author=Rob Mank|publisher=CBS News|date=November 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Susan Bordo]] has suggested that the focus on the issue of personhood in abortion debates has often been a means for depriving women of their rights. She writes that "the legal double standard concerning the bodily integrity of pregnant and nonpregnant bodies, the construction of women as fetal incubators, the bestowal of 'super-subject' status to the fetus, and the emergence of a father's-rights ideology" demonstrate "that the current terms of the abortion debate – as a contest between fetal claims to personhood and women's right to choose – are limited and misleading."&lt;ref&gt;Susan Bordo, "Are Mothers Persons?", ''Unbearable Weight: Feminism, Western Culture, and the Body'', Berkeley and Los Angeles, CA: University of California Press, 2003, 71–97.&lt;/ref&gt;

Others, such as Colleen Carroll Campbell, say that the personhood movement is a natural progression of society in protecting the equal rights of all members of the human species.  She writes, “The basic philosophical premise behind these [personhood] amendments is eminently reasonable. And the alternative on offer – which severs humanity from personhood – is fraught with peril. If being human is not enough to entitle one to [[human rights]], then the very concept of human rights loses meaning. And all of us — born and unborn, strong and weak, young and old — someday will find ourselves on the wrong end of that cruel measuring stick."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Campbell|first=Colleen Carroll|title=Personhood begins when life begins|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/on-faith/post/personhood-begins-when-life-begins/2011/11/02/gIQARCXwgM_blog.html|accessdate=23 May 2012|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=November 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Frank Pavone|Father Frank Pavone]] agrees, adding, “Nor is this a dispute about the state imposing a religious or philosophical view. After all, your life and mine are not protected because of some religious or philosophical belief that others are required to have about us. More accurately, the law protects us precisely in spite of the beliefs of others who, in their own [[World view|worldview]], may not value our lives. …To support Roe vs. Wade is not merely to allow a medical procedure. It is to acknowledge that the government has the power to say who is a person and who is not. Who, then, is to limit the groups to whom it is applied? This is what makes “personhood” such an important public policy issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Pavone|first=Fr.

The [[Roman Catholic Church|Vatican]] has recently been advancing a human [[Human exceptionalism|exceptionalist]] understanding of personhood theory. Catechism 2270 reads: “Human life must be respected and protected absolutely from the moment of conception. From the first moment of his existence, a human being must be recognized as having the rights of a person—among which is the inviolable right of every innocent being to life.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Article 5, The Fifth Commandment|url=http://old.usccb.org/catechism/text/pt3sect2chpt2art5.shtml|publisher=United States Conference of Catholic Bishops|accessdate=23 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Personhood proponents in Oklahoma sought to amend the state constitution to define personhood as beginning at conception.

In 1983, the people of Ireland added the [[Eighth Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland|Eighth Amendment]] to their constitution that “acknowledges the right to life of the unborn and, with due regard to the equal right to life of the mother, guarantees in its laws to respect, and, as far as practicable, by its laws to defend and vindicate that right.”

====Women====

In 1920, with the [[Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]], women became protected against discrimination in their right to vote in the United States.  In 1971, the [[US Supreme Court]] ruled in ''[[Reed v. Reed]]''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.historyofsupremecourt.org/resources/lp_gender_reedvreed.htm Equal Protection for Women]&lt;/ref&gt; that the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|14th amendment]] applies to [[women]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.enotes.com/supreme-court-drama/reed-v-reed Reed v.

saying that the Constitution's use of the gender-neutral term "Person" means that the Constitution does not require discrimination on the basis of sex, but also does not prohibit such discrimination; he said "Nobody ever thought that that's what it meant. Nobody ever voted for that.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/carolyn-maloney/lets-put-it-in-writing-wo_b_874759.html Let's Put It in Writing: Women Are Equal]&lt;/ref&gt;  Many others, including law professor [[Jack Balkin]] disagree with this assertion.

Also, other commentators have noted that some people who ratified the Constitution in 1787 in other contemporaneous contexts ratified state level Constitutions that saw women as Persons, required to be treated as such, including in rights such as voting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Constitution of New Jersey, 1776.|year=1776|publisher=The Avalon Project at Yale Law School.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New Jersey Women's History|url=http://www.njwomenshistory.org/index.htm|publisher=Alice Paul Institute|accessdate=27 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The 17th and 18th Century Quaker concept of Personhood most certainly applied to women and the prevalence of Quakers in the population of several colonies, such as New Jersey and Pennsylvania at the time the original Constitution was drafted and ratified likely influenced the use of the term "Person" in the Constitution rather than the term "Man" used in the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]] and in the contemporaneously drafted [[French Constitution of 1791]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Calvert|first=Jane|title=Quaker Constitutionalism and the Political Thought of John Dickinson|year=2009|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-88436-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of personhood beginning at conception gives issues to women. Daniel Fincke states "Applying the logic to abortion she argues that an involuntarily pregnant woman has the right to refuse to let her body be used by the fetus even were we to reason that the fetus has a right to life."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.patheos.com/blogs/camelswithhammers/2014/06/moral-and-philosophical-arguments-against-fetal-personhood/&lt;/ref&gt; The personhood movement may cause many more issues that just a women's right to choose. Some fetal homicide laws have caused women to be sentenced to jail time for suspected drug use during her pregnancy that ended in a miscarriage, like the Alabama women who was sentenced to ten years for her suspected drug use.&lt;ref&gt;https://newrepublic.com/article/politics/94470/personhood-abortion-mississippi-roe-wade&lt;/ref&gt;

====Slaves====

[[File:Am I not a man.jpg|150px|thumb|''Am I not a man'' [[emblem]] used during the campaign to abolish [[slavery]]]]
In 1772, [[Somersett's Case]] determined that [[slavery]] was unsupported by law in [[England and Wales]], but not elsewhere in the [[British Empire]]. In 1868, under the 14th Amendment, [[black men]] in the United States became citizens. In 1870, under the [[Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|15th Amendment]], black men got the right to vote.

In 1853, [[Sojourner Truth]] became famous for asking ''[[Ain't I a Woman?]]'' and after slavery was abolished, black men continued to fight for personhood by claiming, ''[[I Am A Man!]]''

====Children====

The legal definition of persons may include or exclude children depending on the context.  In the US, regarding liability, children or minors are not legally persons because they do not satisfy the requirements for personhood under the law.&lt;ref name=duhaime&gt;{{cite web|last1=Duhaime|first1=Lloyd|title=Person Definition, duhaime.org, Learn Law|url=http://www.duhaime.org/LegalDictionary/P/Person.aspx|website=duhaime.org|accessdate=30 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, regarding protection under the law, the US [[Born-Alive Infants Protection Act]] of 2002 provides a legal structure that those born at any gestational stage that are either breathing,  have heartbeat, umbilical cord pulsation, or any voluntary muscle movement are living, individual human persons.&lt;ref Pub.L. 107-207, 116 Stat. 926, enacted August 5, 2002&gt;http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=107_cong_reports&amp;docid=f:hr186.107&lt;/ref&gt;

===Non-human animals===
{{See also|Great ape personhood}}
Some philosophers and those involved in animal welfare, [[ethology]], [[animal rights|the rights of animals]], and related subjects, consider that certain animals should also be considered to be persons and thus granted legal personhood. Commonly named species in this context include the [[great ape]]s, [[cetacean]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.physorg.com/news181981904.html |title=Scientists say dolphins should be treated as non-human persons |publisher=Physorg.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[elephant]]s, because of their apparent intelligence and intricate social rules. The idea of extending personhood to all animals has the support of legal scholars such as [[Alan Dershowitz]]&lt;ref name="DershowitzAA"&gt;{{cite book |last=Dershowitz |first=Alan |title=Rights from Wrongs: A Secular Theory of the Origins of Rights |year=2004 |pages= 198–99 }}  and {{cite book |author=Darwin, Meet Dershowitz |title=The Animals' Advocate |date= Winter 2002 |volume= 21}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Laurence Tribe]] of [[Harvard Law School]],&lt;ref name="AAMC"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aamc.org/newsroom/reporter/oct03/animalrights.htm |title=Personhood Redefined: Animal Rights Strategy Gets at the Essence of Being Human |publisher= Association of American Medical Colleges |accessdate= July 12, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[animal law]] courses are now{{when|date=June 2014}} taught in 92 out of 180 law schools in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aldf.org/content/index.php?pid=83 |title=Animal law courses |publisher=[[Animal Legal Defense Fund]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080306074941/http://www.aldf.org/content/index.php?pid=83 |archivedate=2008-03-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; On May 9, 2008, [[Columbia University Press]] published [http://www.columbia.edu/cu/cup/catalog/data/978023113/9780231139502.HTM Animals as Persons: Essays on the Abolition of Animal Exploitation] by Professor [[Gary L. Francione]] of [[Rutgers University]] School of Law, a collection of writings that summarizes his work to date and makes the case for non-human animals as persons.

Some{{who|date=April 2014}} proponents of [[human exceptionalism]] (also referred to by its critics as [[speciesism]] or human supremacism&lt;ref&gt;Environmental Culture: The Ecological Crisis of Reason
By Val Plumwood&lt;/ref&gt;) have countered that we must institute a strict demarcation of personhood based on species membership in order to avoid the horrors of [[genocide]] (based on propaganda dehumanizing one or more ethnicities) or the injustices of [[forced sterilization]] (as occurred in many countries to people with low I.Q. scores and prisoners).{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}

Other theorists attempt to demarcate between degrees of personhood. For example, [[Peter Singer]]'s two-tiered account distinguishes between basic sentience and the higher standard of self-consciousness which constitutes personhood.  [[Wynn Schwartz]] has offered a Paradigm Case Formulation of Persons as a format allowing judges to identify qualities of personhood in different entities.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Schwartz, W, 2013  "The Problem of other possible persons" http://freedomliberationreaction.blogspot.com/2013/06/the-problem-of-other-possible-persons.html&lt;/ref&gt;  Julian Friedland has advanced a seven-tiered account based on cognitive capacity and linguistic mastery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Friedland|first=Julian|title=MINDS THAT MATTER: SEVEN DEGREES OF MORAL STANDING|url=http://digitalcommons.calpoly.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1047&amp;context=bts|work=[[Between the Species]]|publisher=Cal Poly|volume=13|year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amanda Stoel suggested that rights should be granted based on a scale of degrees of personhood, allowing entities currently denied any right to be recognized some rights, but not as many.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Stoel|first=Amanda|title=THE MEME OF ALTRUISM AND DEGREES OF PERSONHOOD|url=http://www.terasemjournals.com/PCJournal/PC0701/Papers/Stoel.pdf|work=Journal of Personal Cyberconsciousness|publisher=Terasem Movement, Inc.|page=35|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1992, Switzerland amended its [[Constitution of Switzerland|constitution]] to recognize animals as ''beings'' and not ''things''.&lt;ref name="APBerlin"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/world/2002/05/18/germany-rights.htm |title=Germany guarantees animal rights in constitution |accessdate=2008-06-26 |date=2002-05-18 |publisher=Associated Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; A decade later, Germany guaranteed rights to animals in a 2002 amendment to its constitution, becoming the first [[European Union]] member to do so.&lt;ref name="APBerlin" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2002/WORLD/europe/06/21/germany.animals/index.html |title=Germany guarantees animal rights |accessdate=2008-06-26 |date=2002-06-21 |publisher=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Connolly|first1=Kate|title=German animals given legal rights|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2002/jun/22/germany.animalwelfare|website=the Guardian|language=en|date=22 June 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; New Zealand granted basic rights to five great ape species in 1999.

In 2013, India's Ministry of Forests and Environment banned the importation or capture of cetaceans (whales and dolphins) for entertainment, exhibition, or interaction purposes, on the basis that "cetaceans in general are highly intelligent and sensitive" and that it "is morally unacceptable to keep them captive for entertainment." It noted that "various scientists" have argued they should be seen as "non-human persons" with commensurate rights, but did not take an official position on this, and indeed did not have the legal authority to do so.&lt;ref&gt;Indian Ministry of Forests and Environment, Circular F.

In 2014, a hybrid, zoo-born orangutan named [[Sandra (orangutan)|Sandra]] was termed by the court in Argentina as a "non-human subject" in an unsuccessful habeas corpus case regarding the release of the orangutan from captivity at the Buenos Aires zoo. The status of the orangutan as a "non-human subject" needs to be clarified by the court. Court cases relevant to this orangutan are continuing in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;For corporations, see [https://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/22/us/politics/22scotus.html "Justices, 5–4, Reject Corporate Spending Limit"], ''Reuters'', December 21, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, for the first time, two chimpanzees, Hercules and Leo, were thought to be "legal persons," having been granted a writ of [[habeas corpus]]. This meant their detainer, [[Stony Brook University]], had to provide a legally sufficient reason for their imprisonment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nonhumanrightsproject.org/2015/04/20/judge-recognizes-two-chimpanzees-as-legal-persons-grants-them-writ-of-habeas-corpus|title=First Time in World History Judge Recognizes Two Chimpanzees as Legal Persons, Grants them Writ of Habeas Corpus |accessdate=2015-04-20 |date=2015-04-20 |publisher=Nonhuman Rights Project}}&lt;/ref&gt; This view was rejected and the writ was reversed by the officiating judge shortly thereafter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://nypost.com/2015/04/21/judge-reverses-human-rights-status-for-chimpanzees/|title=Judge reverses 'human rights' status for chimpanzees}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hypothetical beings===

Speculatively, there are several other likely categories of beings where personhood is at issue.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

====Aliens====

If [[alien life]] were found to exist, under what circumstances would they be counted as "persons"? Do we have to consider any "willing and communicative (capable to register its own will) autonomous body" in the universe, no matter the species, an individual (a person)? Do they deserve equal rights with the human race?

====Artificial intelligence or life====

If [[artificial intelligence]]s, intelligent and self-aware system of hardware and software, are eventually created, what criteria would determine their personhood? Likewise, at what point would human-created biological life achieve personhood?

====Modified humans====

The theoretical landscape of personhood theory has been altered recently by controversy in the bioethics community concerning an emerging community of scholars, researchers, and activists identifying with an explicitly [[transhumanist]] position, which supports [[morphological freedom]], even if a person changed so much as to no longer be considered a member of the human [[species]]. For example, how much of a human can be [[prosthetics|artificially]] replaced before one loses their personhood? If people are considered persons because of their [[brain]], then what if the brain's thought patterns, memories and other attributes could be transposed into a device? Would the patient still be considered a person after the operation?

===Corporations===

{{Main article|Corporate personhood}}
Today, in statutory and corporate [[law]], certain [[social construct]]s are legally considered persons. In many jurisdictions, some [[corporation]]s and other [[Legal person|legal entities]] are considered [[legal person]]s with standing to sue or be sued in court. This is known as legal or [[corporate personhood]].

In 1819, the US Supreme Court ruled in ''[[Dartmouth College v. Woodward]]'', that corporations have the same rights as natural persons to enforce contracts.

===Environmental entities===
====Bolivia====
In 2006, Bolivia passed a law recognizing the rights of nature "to not be affected by mega-infrastructure and development projects that affect the balance of ecosystems and the local inhabitant communities".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/apr/10/bolivia-enshrines-natural-worlds-rights|title=

10 April 2011 |accessdate=4 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
====Ecuador====
{{Main|Sumac Kawsay}}
In 2008, Ecuador approved a constitution to recognize that nature "...has the right to exist, persist, maintain and regenerate its vital cycles, structure, functions and its processes in evolution."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://therightsofnature.org/ecuador-rights/ |title=Ecuador Adopts Rights of Nature in Constitution |work=Global Alliance for the Rights of Nature|last= |first= |date= |accessdate=4 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
====New Zealand====
The [[Whanganui River]] of New Zealand is revered by the local [[Māori people]] as ''Te Awa Tupua'', sometimes translated as "an integrated, living whole".  Efforts to grant it special legal protection have been pursued by the Whanganui [[iwi]] since the 1870s.  In 2012, an agreement to grant legal personhood to the river was signed between the New Zealand government and the Whanganui River Māori Trust.  One guardian from the [[Monarchy of New Zealand|Crown]] and one from the Whanganui are responsible for protecting the river.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10830586 |title=Agreement entitles Whanganui River to legal identity |work=The New Zealand Herald |last=Shuttleworth |first=Kate |date=Aug 30, 2012 |accessdate=Jan 27, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
====India====
In 2017,  court in the northern Indian state of [[Uttarakhand]] recognized the [[Ganges]] and [[Yamuna]] as legal persons. The judges cited Whanganui river in New Zealand as precedent for the action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/mar/21/ganges-and-yamuna-rivers-granted-same-legal-rights-as-human-beings|title=Ganges and Yamuna rivers granted same legal rights as human beings |work=The Guardian|last=Safi|first=Michael |date=|accessdate=Jan 27, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religion==

{{Refimprove section|date=January 2011}}

In [[animism|animistic]] religion, animals, plants, and other entities may be persons or [[deity|deities]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}

===Christianity===

Christianity is the first philosophical system to use the word "person" in its modern sense.&lt;ref&gt;Met. John Zizioulas, ''Being As Communion: Studies in Personhood and the Church''. Crestwood: St. Vladimir's Seminary Press, 1997, pp. 27–49&lt;/ref&gt; The word "''persona''" was transformed from its theater use into a term with strict technical theological meaning by [[Tertullian]] in his work, ''Adversus Praxean'' ("Against Praxeas"), in order to distinguish the three "persons" of the [[Trinity]]. Subsequently, [[Boethius]] refined the word to mean "an individual substance of a rational nature." This can be re-stated as "that which possesses an intellect and a will." Thus, the word "person" was originally a theological term created and defined by Christians to explain Christian theological concepts.

{{quote|The definition of Boethius as it stands can hardly be considered a satisfactory one. The words taken literally can be applied to the rational soul of man, and also the human nature of Christ. That St. Thomas accepts it is presumably due to the fact that he found it in possession, and recognized as the traditional definition. He explains it in terms that practically constitute a new definition. ''Individua substantia'' signifies, he says, ''substantia, completa, per se subsistens, separata ab aliia'', i.e., a substance, complete, subsisting per se, existing apart from others (III, Q. xvi, a. 12, ''ad 2um'').

If to this be added ''rationalis naturae'', we have a definition comprising the five notes that go to make up a person: (a) ''substantia''-- this excludes accident; (b) ''completa''-- it must form a complete nature; that which is a part, either actually or "aptitudinally" does not satisfy the definition; (c) ''per se subsistens''--the person exists in itself and for itself; he or she is ''sui juris'', the ultimate possessor of his or her nature and all its acts, the ultimate subject of predication of all his or her attributes; that which exists in another is not a person; (d) ''separata ab aliis''--this excludes the universal, ''substantia secunda'', which has no existence apart from the individual; (e) ''rationalis naturae''--excludes all non-intellectual ''supposita''.

To a person therefore belongs a threefold incommunicability, expressed in notes (b), (c), and (d). The human soul belongs to the nature as a part of it, and is therefore not a person, even when existing separately.|''Catholic Encyclopedia'', 1913|Person}}

{{Love sidebar}}

'''Physical intimacy''' is sensual [[Proxemics|proximity]] or touching.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.counsel.ufl.edu/brochure.asp?include=brochures/physical_intimacy.brochure]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071118211208/http://www.counsel.ufl.edu/brochure.asp?include=brochures%2Fphysical_intimacy.brochure|date=2007-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is an act or reaction, such as an expression of [[feeling]]s (including close [[friendship]], [[platonic love]], [[romance (love)|romantic love]] or [[sexual attraction]]), between people. Examples of physical intimacy include being inside someone's [[Proxemics|personal space]], [[holding hands]], [[hug]]ging, [[kiss]]ing, caressing and [[Human sexual activity|sexual activity]]. Physical intimacy can often convey the real meaning or intention of an interaction in a way that accompanying speech simply cannot do. Physical intimacy can be exchanged between any people but as it is often used to communicate positive and intimate feelings, it most often occurs in people who have a preexisting relationship, whether familial platonic or romantic, with romantic relationships having increased physical intimacy. Several forms of romantic touch have been noted including holding hands, hugging, kissing, cuddling, caressing and massaging, and physical affection is highly correlated with overall relationship and partner satisfaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Guéguen|first=Nicolas|last2=Fischer-Lokou|first2=Jacques|date=2003-02|title=Another Evaluation of Touch and Helping Behavior|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.2466/pr0.2003.92.1.62|journal=Psychological Reports|volume=92|issue=1|pages=62–64|doi=10.2466/pr0.2003.92.1.62|issn=0033-2941}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is possible to be physically intimate with someone without actually touching them; however, a certain [[Proxemics|proximity]] is necessary. For instance, a sustained [[eye contact]] is considered a form of physical intimacy, analogous to touching. When a person enters someone else's personal space for the purpose of being intimate, it is physical intimacy, regardless of the lack of actual physical contact.

Most people partake in physical intimacy, which is a natural part of interpersonal relationships and [[human sexuality]], and research has shown it has health benefits. A hug or touch can result in the release of [[oxytocin]], [[dopamine]] and [[serotonin]], and in a reduction in stress [[hormone]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/health/2008-09-28-touch-healing_N.htm |title=Human touch may have some healing properties |publisher=USA Today |date=2008-09-28 |accessdate=2011-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the important role that language-based communication plays in humans, the role of touch is often downplayed, however there is ample evidence that physical touch still plays an important role in everyday human relationships. While humans often communicate verbally, we also participate in close contact. Physical touch has emotional and social connotations that often far outweigh anything that can be expressed in language.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Burgoon|first=Judee K.|date=1991|title=Relational message interpretations of touch, conversational distance, and posture|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/bf00986924|journal=Journal of Nonverbal Behavior|volume=15|issue=4|pages=233–259|doi=10.1007/bf00986924|issn=0191-5886}}&lt;/ref&gt;
environment that allows support itself to be traded mutually. 

==Overview==
Inducements towards physical intimacy can come from various sources. During colder seasons, humans as well as other animals seek physical intimacy with one another as a means to apportion thermoregulation.&lt;ref&gt;Stabentheiner, Anton, et al. "Endothermic heat production in honeybee winter clusters." Journal of Experimental Biology 206.2 (2003): 353-358.&lt;/ref&gt; Some forms of physical touch among monkeys and apes, serve multiple functions, including cleaning, treatment of a lice influx or infection and social grooming.&lt;ref&gt;Diezinger, F. T., and J. R. Anderson. "Starting from scratch: A first look at a “displacement activity” in group‐living rhesus monkeys." American Journal of Primatology 11.2 (1986): 117-124.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Some forms of physical intimacy may be received negatively. This attitude is especially marked amongst those with haphephobia.&lt;ref&gt;Synnott, Anthony. "Bodily senses." The International Encyclopedia of Human Sexuality (2015).&lt;/ref&gt; One study has shown that there's generally a higher level of physical intimacy allowed between [[immediate family]] members than between [[second-degree relative]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spring.org.uk/2015/10/the-body-map-of-acceptable-social-touching.php|title=The Body Map of Acceptable Social Touching - PsyBlog|date=28 October 2015|website=Spring.org.uk|accessdate=18 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Intimacy norms are usually more negative near [[erogenous zone]]s. Some jurisdictions may specify this as referring to the [[genitals]], [[buttocks]] and female [[breast]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Stein, Nan. "Sexual harassment in school: The public performance of gendered violence." Harvard educational review 65.2 (1995): 145-163.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development ==
Physical affection and intimacy appear to have a profoundly important role during infancy and childhood. The skin is the largest sensory organ and is the first to develop. Humans experience touch as early as fetal development, when the fetus begins receiving sensory information from coming in contact with the mothers’ abdominal wall. In infancy, babies receive significant amounts of touch through being held, cuddled, and breastfed. In addition to necessary functions like breastfeeding, touch is also used to sooth and calm babies or with skin-to-skin contact called "kangaroo care."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ferber|first=Sari Goldstein|last2=Feldman|first2=Ruth|last3=Makhoul|first3=Imad R.|date=2008-06|title=The development of maternal touch across the first year of life|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.earlhumdev.2007.09.019|journal=Early Human Development|volume=84|issue=6|pages=363–370|doi=10.1016/j.earlhumdev.2007.09.019|issn=0378-3782}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vision and auditory senses are limited in infancy and babies are introduced to their world primarily through touch and are able to distinguish between temperature and texture. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Field|first=Tiffany|last2=Hernandez-Reif|first2=Maria|last3=Diego|first3=Miguel|date=2010-05-04|title=Depressed mothers' newborns are less responsive to animate and inanimate stimuli|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/icd.687|journal=Infant and Child Development|volume=20|issue=1|pages=94–105|doi=10.1002/icd.687|issn=1522-7227}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal space==
[[File:Physical intimacy.jpg|thumb|219x219px|Young men engage in cuddling, a form of physical intimacy]]
[[File:Hugging.jpg|right|thumb|Women sharing physical intimacy]]
Most people value their [[Proxemics|personal space]] and feel discomfort, [[anger]] or [[anxiety]] when somebody encroaches on their personal space without consent.&lt;ref name=Hall&gt;{{cite book | last = Hall | first = Edward T. | title = The Hidden Dimension | publisher = Anchor Books | year = 1966 | isbn = 0-385-08476-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Entering somebody's personal space is normally an indication of familiarity and intimacy. However, in modern society, especially in crowded urban communities, it is at times difficult to maintain personal space, for example, in a crowded [[train]], [[elevator]] or street. Many people find the physical proximity within crowded spaces to be psychologically disturbing and uncomfortable,&lt;ref name=Hall /&gt;.In an impersonal crowded situation, eye contact tends to be avoided. Even in a crowded place, preserving personal space is important. Non-consensual intimate and sexual contact, such as [[frotteurism]] and [[groping]], are unacceptable.

On the other hand, most people occasionally desire physical proximity to others, and will at times welcome a familiar and trusted person into their personal space. When a partner or friend is not available at such a time, some people satisfy this need for human contact in a crowded venue, such as a [[bar]], [[nightclub]], [[rock concert]], [[festival|street festival]], etc.

==Display of affection==
People who are on a [[Intimate relationship#Intimacy|familiar basis]] may enter into each other's personal space to make physical contact. These can be indicators of affection and trust. The manner in which people display affection is generally different in a public context to a private one. In private, people in an [[intimate relationship]] or who are familiar with each other may be at ease with physical contact and displays of affection, which may involve:
* cuddling,
* caressing (e.g. head, hands, arms, back and waist),
* [[tickling]] (e.g. back and waist),
* [[massage]] (e.g. neck, shoulders, back, thighs), or
* [[touching heads]].

Bonding through intimate, non-sexual contact between platonic friends and family members includes, but is not limited to, holding hands, hugging, cuddling, and kissing on the cheeks.

In public, however, and depending on the nature of the relationship between the people, a [[public display of affection]] is generally constrained by [[social norm]]s and can range from a gesture, such as a [[kiss]] or [[hug]] in greeting, to an embrace or [[holding hands]]. Maintaining [[eye contact]] can be regarded socially and psychologically as analogous to touching.

== Skinship ==
The term {{nihongo|"skinship"|スキンシップ|''sukinshippu''}} originated as a [[pseudo-Anglicism|pseudo-English]] Japanese word (''[[wasei-eigo]]''), which was coined to describe the intimacy, or closeness, between a mother and a child.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jg5YLjBOVHEC&amp;pg=PA162 |page=162|title=Embodying Culture: Pregnancy in Japan and Israel|first=Tsipy|last= Ivry |publisher= Rutgers University Press|year= 2009 |isbn= 0-8135-4636-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yWfTqRKXqDcC&amp;pg=PA186 |page=186|title=Parents' cultural belief systems: their origins, expressions, and consequences|first1=Sara|last1= Harkness|first2= Charles M. |last2=Super |publisher= Guilford Press|year= 1996 |isbn= 1-57230-031-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hijirida1987"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ORNzbaPIdVUC&amp;pg=PA218 |page=218|title=Japanese language and culture for business and travel |first1= Kyoko|last1= Hijirida|first2= Muneo|last2= Yoshikawa |publisher=University of Hawaii Press|year= 1987 |isbn= 0-8248-1017-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Today, the word is generally used for bonding through physical contact, such as holding hands, hugging, or parents washing their child at a bath. The earliest citation of this word appears in ''[[Nihon Kokugo Daijiten]]'' in 1971.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wordspy.com/words/skinship.asp |title=Skinship |publisher=Word Spy |date=2003-02-05 |accessdate=2007-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Scott Clark, author of a study of [[Public bathing#Japan|Japanese bathing culture]], the word is a [[portmanteau]] combining "skin" with the last syllable of "friendship".&lt;ref&gt;Clark, Scott. ''Japan, a View from the Bath''. Honolulu: [[University of Hawaii Press]], 1994, p. 73. {{ISBN|0-8248-1615-3}}, {{ISBN|0-8248-1657-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The similarity with the English word '[[kinship]]' suggests a further explanation.&lt;ref name="Hijirida1987"/&gt;

Use of the word "skinship" in English publications seems to focus on the notion of sharing a bath naked, an idea known in Japanese as {{nihongo|"naked association"|裸の付き合い|hadaka no tsukiai}}.{{cn|date=January 2018}} It is not clear why the meaning shifted to the parent–child relationship when [[Reborrowing|borrowed back]] into English.

This word is also used in [[South Korea]].{{cn|date=April 2018}}

== Culture ==
The role of touch in interpersonal relationships across development and in different cultures is understudied, however, some observational data suggests that in cultures who engage in more physical intimacy have lower rates of violence, demonstrated in adolescents and children.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Field|first=Tiffany|date=1999-01|title=Preschoolers in America are Touched Less and are More Aggressive Than Preschoolers in France|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/0300443991510102|journal=Early Child Development and Care|volume=151|issue=1|pages=11–17|doi=10.1080/0300443991510102|issn=0300-4430}}&lt;/ref&gt; Peoples living nearer to the equator tend to have high-contact social norms (Mediterranean, central and south America, Islamic countries, whereas countries further from the equator tend to be lower contact (norther Europe, north America, northeast Asian). The public display of interpersonal touch and intimacy appears to vary across cultures as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Touch|last=Field|first=Tiffany|publisher=MIT Press|year=2001|isbn=|location=Cambridge, Ma|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Among non-human primates ==
Some animals participate in behaviors similar to physical affection in humans. Called social grooming or allo-grooming, these behaviors are less common outside of primates, while other species do perform these behaviors, primates seem to spend much more time doing this compared to other animals. Some species devote as much as 20% of their day to grooming behaviors, much of which is spent grooming others, rather than themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dunbar|first=R.I.M.|date=1991|title=Functional Significance of Social Grooming in Primates|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1159/000156574|journal=Folia Primatologica|volume=57|issue=3|pages=121–131|doi=10.1159/000156574|issn=1421-9980}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lehmann|first=J.|last2=Korstjens|first2=A.H.|last3=Dunbar|first3=R.I.M.|date=2007-12|title=Group size, grooming and social cohesion in primates|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.anbehav.2006.10.025|journal=Animal Behaviour|volume=74|issue=6|pages=1617–1629|doi=10.1016/j.anbehav.2006.10.025|issn=0003-3472}}&lt;/ref&gt; In more social species the amount of time spent in self grooming is much less than the time spent in social grooming. While these behaviors may appear to be for the purpose of hygiene (i.e. removal of parasites, fur cleanliness, etc.), evidence suggests that grooming behaviors perform a unique social function which facilitates bonding.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dunbar|first=R.I.M.|date=1991|title=Functional Significance of Social Grooming in Primates|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1159/000156574|journal=Folia Primatologica|volume=57|issue=3|pages=121–131|doi=10.1159/000156574|issn=1421-9980}}&lt;/ref&gt; From an evolutionary perspective, the amount of time being devoted to allo-grooming appears to exceed the amount of time in which it would be adaptive, therefore underscoring the idea that grooming must have a purpose beyond hygiene maintenance. Furthermore, there are core grooming partnerships which remain quite stable and do not change frequently, sometimes with the same partners on the timescale of years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dunbar|first=R.I.M.|date=2010-02|title=The social role of touch in humans and primates: Behavioural function and neurobiological mechanisms|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neubiorev.2008.07.001|journal=Neuroscience &amp; Biobehavioral Reviews|volume=34|issue=2|pages=260–268|doi=10.1016/j.neubiorev.2008.07.001|issn=0149-7634}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some argue that grooming is something which is exchanged like a service with the expectation that equal amounts of time will be spent or reciprocated by their grooming partner.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Noë|first=Ronald|title=Biological markets: partner choice as the driving force behind the evolution of mutualisms|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/cbo9780511752421.008|work=Economics in Nature|pages=93–118|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780511752421|access-date=2018-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Primates tend to groom each other equal amounts of time or with the expectation that they will be reciprocated with defense in a dangerous situation. Primates who spend more time grooming each other are more likely to defend each other when attacked. Although it is not clear how this effect is brought about, in all likelihood it is the protective effect that known relationships have: more dominant animals are less likely to attack or harass an individual who is known to have grooming partners who might come to its aid. However, the likelihood of a female going to the aid of another female when the latter is under attack is significantly correlated with the amount of time the two of them spend grooming with each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dunbar|first=R. I. M.|date=1980-11|title=Determinants and evolutionary consequences of dominance among female gelada baboons|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/bf00300665|journal=Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology|volume=7|issue=4|pages=253–265|doi=10.1007/bf00300665|issn=0340-5443}}&lt;/ref&gt; A more plausible interpretation is that grooming provides the psychological underpinning for an individual’s willingness to offer subsequent support. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dunbar|first=R.I.M.|last2=Dunbar|first2=Patsy|date=1988-08|title=Maternal time budgets of gelada baboons|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/s0003-3472(88)80055-1|journal=Animal Behaviour|volume=36|issue=4|pages=970–980|doi=10.1016/s0003-3472(88)80055-1|issn=0003-3472}}&lt;/ref&gt; It does this not by offering a direct exchange of benefits, but rather by creating the psychological

'''Positive deconstruction''', in relation to [[Christian apologetics]], is a term first used by [[Nick Pollard]] in ''Evangelism Made Slightly Less Difficult''&lt;ref name=emsld&gt;[[Nick Pollard]], ''Evangelism Made Slightly Less Difficult'' (Leicester: IVP, 1997) pp. 48–56.&lt;/ref&gt; (drawing on Dr. David Cook),&lt;ref name=cook&gt;E. David Cook, ''Blind Alley Beliefs'' 2nd ed. (Leicester: Inter-Varsity Press, 1996).&lt;/ref&gt; to describe a methodology for engaging with [[worldview]]s in Christian apologetics. The process is one of ''deconstruction'' because it involves 'dismantling' the worldview in order to identify areas of conflict with a Christian worldview. It is ''positive'' because the intention is not to destroy a person's ideas and belief system, but to build on areas of agreement between the two worldviews in order to argue for the truth of the Christian worldview.

Pollard identifies four key aspects:

* '''Identify the worldview:''' What beliefs, values and attitudes are being communicated?
* '''Analyse the worldview,''' primarily in terms of the [[Correspondence theory of truth|correspondence]], [[Coherence theory of truth|coherence]] and [[Pragmatic theory of truth|pragmatic]] theories of truth
* '''Affirm the truth:''' what aspects of the worldview are in agreement with a Christian worldview?
* '''Deny the error:''' what aspects of the worldview are in conflict with a Christian worldview?

Tony Watkins develops this in relation to film in ''Focus: The Art and Soul of Cinema''.&lt;ref name=focus&gt;Tony Watkins, ''Focus: The Art and Soul of Cinema'' (Milton Keynes and Tyrone, GA: Damaris, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; He aims to make the positive deconstruction process more accessible, and accordingly re-labels the four aspects of the process (pp.&amp;nbsp;31–45):

* '''Analyse the worldview''', in which he suggests a five-part framework for considering worldviews:
** What is reality?
** What does it mean to be human?
** How do we know what the good is?
** How do we know anything at all?
** What is the fundamental problem confronting all human beings, and what is the solution?
* '''Evaluate the worldview''' (as with Pollard's second stage, this is terms of correspondence, coherence, pragmatism)
* '''Celebrate the good'''
* '''Challenge the bad'''

'''Sadaejuui''' (''lit.'' "serving-the-Great-ism," Hangul: 사대주의, Hanja: 事大主義, {{zh|事大主义}}) is a largely pejorative [[Korean language|Korean]] term which evolved in the mid-20th century  from a more widely used historical concept.&lt;ref name="armstrong57-58"&gt;Armstrong, Charles K. (2007). {{Google books|_mh4Qv4lAkQC|''The Koreas,'' p. 57-58.|page=57}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The contemporary term ''sadaejuui'' was derived from the [[China|Chinese]] ''shi da'' (Korean, ''sadae'') as used by the [[philosopher]], [[Mencius]].
* ''[[Sadae]]'' literally means "dealing with the great" or "serving the great"&lt;ref name="pratt384"&gt;Pratt, Kieth L. ''et al.'' (1999). ''Korea: a historical and cultural dictionary,'' p. 384.&lt;/ref&gt; and interpreted as "Loving and admiring the great and powerful".&lt;ref&gt;Alford, C. Fred. (1999). {{Google books|X9Bdy_HJJpEC|''Think no evil: Korean values in the age of globalization,'' p. 150.|page=150}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Juui'' means "ideology" and it is conventionally translated as "-ism."&lt;ref&gt;Duchatel, Mathieu. [http://www.ceri-sciencespo.com/themes/asie/ceri/enseignements/memoire/duchatel.pd  ''Nationalisme et sentiment nationaliste en Corée''] (Nationalism and Nationalist Sentiment in Korea). ''IEP Paris, DEAA comparative des Aires Politiques,'' p. 4 n1.&lt;/ref&gt;
In other words, ''sadaejuui'' is a compound-word composed of ''sadae'' + ''juui.''

==Etymology==
The term "''sadaejuui''" was invented by early 20th century Korean nationalists.&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell, Anthony. [http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/special/2009/09/265_35927.html  "Happier Economy Better Than Larger Economy,"] ''Korea Times'' (Seoul). October 12, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;  The antecedents of this modern term is the historic term "''sadae''" ({{lang|zh|事大}}), which comes from the word {{lang|zh|以小事大}} in [[Mencius]]'s ({{lang|zh|孟子}}) book,  which means "service to the great by the small" or "a small kingdom accommodates a large."&lt;ref name="armstrong57-58"/&gt;

*Mencius - Liang Hui Wang II
{{cquote|
The king Qi Xuan asked, saying, 'Is there any way to regulate one's maintenance of intercourse with neighbouring kingdoms?'&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Mencius replied, 'Yes, there is. But it requires a perfectly virtuous prince to be able, with a great country, to serve a small one - as, for instance, Tang served Ge, and king Wen served the Kun barbarians. And it requires a wise prince to be able, with a small country, to serve a large one - as the king Tai served the Xun Yu, and Gou Jian served Wu. He who with a great State serves a small one, delights in Heaven. He who with a small State serves a large one, stands in awe of Heaven. He who delights in Heaven, will affect with his love and protection the whole kingdom. He who stands in awe of Heaven, will affect with his love and protection his own kingdom. It is said in the Book of Poetry, "I fear the Majesty of Heaven, and will thus preserve its favouring decree." '

==Overview==
''Sadaejuui'' conflates an attitude of subservience with the [[Realism in international relations theory|political realism]] which accompanies the prudent recognition of greater power.&lt;ref name="armstrong57-58"/&gt;  ''Sadae'' describes a foreign policy characterized by the various ways a small country acknowledges the strength of a greater power like that of China.  ''Sadae'' is made manifest in the actions of the weaker state as it conveys goodwill and respect through its envoys.

The utility of the ''sadae'' concept in Korea was recognized from the period of [[Three Kingdoms of Korea]] to 1897;&lt;ref name="pratt384"/&gt; and it is demonstrated in the relationship of mid-[[Joseon Dynasty|Joseon]] Korea towards the [[Ming Dynasty]] of China.&lt;ref&gt;구도영 (Koo Do-young).

The kingdom of Joseon accepted its place in a Sino-centristic world order.  The Joseon foreign policy was organized around maintaining stable Joseon-Chinese relations in the period from 1392 through 1910. It contrasts with limited trade relationships or ''kyorin'' diplomacy (교린정책/交隣政策; ''lit.'' "neighborly relations") in regard to Joseon-Japanese relations in this period.&lt;ref&gt;Kang, Etsuko H.

[[Image:IAO-logo.png|thumb|180px|[[Information Awareness Office]] seal with its motto ''scientia est potentia'']]
[[File:Zn_sila_logos.svg|thumb|180px|Logos science magazine [[:ru:Знание — сила|''Znanie — sila'']] ([[USSR]]/[[Russia]]) - in translation "Knowledge is power".]]
The phrase "'''''scientia potentia est'''"'' (or "'''''scientia est potentia'''''" or also "'''''scientia potestas est'''")'' is a [[Latin]] [[aphorism]] meaning "knowledge is power".  It is commonly attributed to [[Sir Francis Bacon]], although there is no known occurrence of this precise phrase in Bacon's English or Latin writings. However, the expression "''ipsa scientia potestas est"'' ('knowledge itself is power') occurs in Bacon's ''Meditationes Sacrae'' (1597). The exact phrase "''scientia potentia est"'' was written for the first time in the 1668 version of the work ''[[Leviathan (Hobbes book)|Leviathan]]'' by [[Thomas Hobbes]], who was secretary to Bacon as a young man.

The related phrase "''sapientia est potentia"'' is often translated as "wisdom is power".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.repubblica.it/2004/f/speciale/altri/2004censis/dariofo/dariofo.html|title=Knowledge like challenge to every form of powers|author=Dario Fo|website=repubblica.it|date=June 13, 2004|language=italian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Origins and parallels===

The earliest documented occurrence of the phrase "Knowledge is power" is from Imam [[Ali]] (599-661 CE), as recorded in the tenth-century book [[Nahj Al-Balagha]] (originally in Arabic). He said:

{{Quote|text=Knowledge is power and it can command obedience. A man of knowledge during his lifetime can make people obey and follow him and he is praised and venerated after his death. Remember that knowledge is a ruler and wealth is its subject.|sign=[[Imam Ali]]|source=''[[Nahj Al-Balagha]]'', Saying 146}}

Another account of this concept is found in the [[Shahnameh]] by the Persian poet [[Ferdowsi]] (940–1020 CE) who wrote: "Capable is he who is wise" (in [[Persian language|Persian]]: توانا بود هر که دانا بود).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Shahnameh, first poem, couplet 14. توانا بود هر که دانا بود ز دانش دل پیر برنا بود knowledge is power with the knowledge, the heart of the old people will be young (Ferdowsi)  e.f.|url=http://shahnameh.net/}}&lt;/ref&gt; This [[hemistich]] is translated to English as "knowledge is power" or "One who has wisdom is powerful".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.persianmirror.com/Article_det.cfm?id=1425&amp;getArticleCategory=59&amp;getArticleSubCategory=35 |title=The Modern Magazine for Persian Weddings, Cuisine, Culture &amp; Community |publisher=Persianmirror.com |date= |accessdate=2012-09-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120307171627/http://www.persianmirror.com/Article_det.cfm?id=1425&amp;getArticleCategory=59&amp;getArticleSubCategory=35 |archivedate=2012-03-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A proverb in practically the same wording is found in Hebrew, in the Biblical [[Book of Proverbs]] (24:5): גֶּבֶר-חָכָם בַּעוֹז;    וְאִישׁ-דַּעַת, מְאַמֶּץ-כֹּחַ. This was translated in the latin [[Vulgata]] as "''vir sapiens et fortis est et vir doctus robustus et validus''"&lt;ref&gt;Biblia Sacra Vulgata, [https://la.wikisource.org/wiki/Biblia_Sacra_Vulgata_%28Stuttgartensia%29/Proverbia  Proverbia]&lt;/ref&gt; and in the [[King James Version]], the first English official edition, as "A wise man is strong, a man of knowledge increaseth strength".&lt;ref&gt;Holy Bible, King James Version, [http://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/1611-Bible/book.php?book=Proverbs&amp;chapter=24&amp;verse=5 Proverbs 24:5]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Thomas Hobbes===
&lt;!--The Latin phrase "Scientia potentia est" does not appear at all in''De Homine'' (1658), chapter X. Instead, it does appear Leviathan (1668), section De Homine (of man), chapter X. --&gt;
The first known reference of the exact phrase appeared in the Latin edition of ''[[Leviathan (Hobbes book)|Leviathan]]'' (1668; the English version had been published in 1651). This passage from Part 1 ("De Homine"), Chapter X ("De Potentia, Dignitate et Honore") occurs in a list of various attributes of man which constitute power; in this list, "sciences" or "the sciences" are given a minor position:
{{quote|''Scientia potentia est, sed parva; quia scientia egregia rara est, nec proinde apparens nisi paucissimis, et in paucis rebus. Scientiae enim ea natura est, ut esse intelligi non possit, nisi ab illis qui sunt scientia praediti''&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Hobbes, ''Opera philosophica...'', [https://archive.org/details/operaphilosophi03molegoog Volume III] (''Leviathan'' [1668]), [https://archive.org/stream/operaphilosophi03molegoog#page/n80/mode/2up p. 69]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In the English version this passage reads as thus:
{{quote|''The sciences are small powers; because not eminent, and therefore, not acknowledged in any man; nor are at all, but in a few, and in them, but of a few things. For science is of that nature, as none can understand it to be, but such as in a good measure have attained it.''&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Hobbes, ''The English Works of Thomas Hobbes of Malmesbury...'', [https://archive.org/details/englishworkstho10hobbgoog Volume 3] (Leviathan), [https://archive.org/stream/englishworkstho10hobbgoog#page/n90/mode/2up p. 75].&lt;/ref&gt;}}
   
On a later work, ''[[De Corpore]]'' (1655), also written in Latin, Hobbes expanded the same idea:
{{quote|''The end or scope of philosophy is, that we may make use to our benefit of effects formerly seen ... for the commodity of human life ... The end of knowledge is power ... lastly, the scope of all speculation is the performing of some action, or thing to be done.''&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Hobbes ''De Corpore'', Part I, Chapter I (''On Phylosophy''). In Thomas Hobbes, ''The English Works of Thomas Hobbes of Malmesbury...'', [https://archive.org/details/englishworkstho21hobbgoog Volume I], [https://archive.org/stream/englishworkstho21hobbgoog#page/n32/mode/2up p. 7]. From the Latin edition: Thomas Hobbes, ''Opera philosophica...'', [https://archive.org/details/operaphilosophi04molegoog Volume 1], [https://archive.org/stream/operaphilosophi04molegoog#page/n132/mode/2up p. 6]&lt;/ref&gt;}}
In Jean Hampton, ''Hobbes and the social contract tradition'' (1988), Hampton indicates that this quote is 'after Bacon' and in a footnote, that 'Hobbes was Bacon's secretary as a young man and had philosophical discussions with him (Aubrey 1898, 331).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.todayinsci.com/H/Hobbes_Thomas/HobbesThomas-Quotations.htm |title=Thomas Hobbes Quotes - 14 Science Quotes - Dictionary of Science Quotations and Scientist Quotes |publisher=Todayinsci.com |date=2012-01-19 |accessdate=2012-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Francis Bacon===
[[Image:Francis Bacon 2.jpg|thumb|left|[[Sir Francis Bacon]], "''ipsa scientia potestas est"'' (knowledge itself is power). ''Meditationes Sacrae'' (1597).]]
The closest expression in Bacon's works is, perhaps, the expression "''scientia potestas est''", found in his ''[[s:Meditationes sacrae|Meditationes Sacrae]]'' (1597), which is perhaps better translated as "knowledge is His power", because the context of the sentence refers to the qualities of God and is imbedded in a discussion of heresies that deny the power of God:
''statuuntque latiores terminos scientiae Dei quam potestatis, vel potius ejus partis potestatis Dei (nam et ipsa scientia potestas est) qua scit, quam ejus qua movet et agit: ut praesciat quaedam otiose, quae non praedestinet et praeordinet''.

The English translation of this section includes the following:

: "This canon is the mother of all canons against heresies. The cause of error is twofold : ignorance of the will of God, and ignorance or superficial consideration of the power of God. The will of God is more revealed through the Scriptures… his power more through his creatures… So is the plenitude of God’s power to be asserted, as not to involve any imputation upon his will. So is the goodness of his will to be asserted, as not to imply any derogation of his power. 
: "… Atheism and Theomachy rebels and mutinies against the power of God ; not trusting to his word, which reveals his will, because it does not believe in his power, to whom all things are possible… But of the heresies which deny the power of God, there are, besides simple atheism, three degrees…

: "The third degree is of those who limit and restrain the former opinion to human actions only, which partake of sin: which actions they suppose to depend substantively and without any chain of causes upon the inward will and choice of man; and who give a wider range to the knowledge of God than to his power; or rather to that part of God’s power (for knowledge itself is power) whereby he knows, than to that whereby he works and acts ; suffering him to fore know some things as an unconcerned looker on, which he does not predestine and preordain : a notion not unlike the figment which Epicurus introduced into the philosophy of Democritus, to get rid of fate and make room for fortune; namely the sidelong motion of the Atom; which has ever by the wiser sort been accounted a very {{nowrap|empty device." (pp.&amp;nbsp;94–95; ''Works of Bacon'',}} Vol XIV, Boston; Brown and Taggard, 1861)

Interpretation of the notion of power meant by Bacon must therefore take into account his distinction between the power of knowing and the power of working and acting, the opposite of what is assumed when the maxim is taken out of context.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Vickers|first=Brian|title=Francis Bacon and the Progress of Knowledge|journal=Journal of the History of Ideas|year=1992|volume=53|issue=3|pages=495–518|jstor=2709891}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Indeed, the quotation has become a [[cliche]].

In another place, Bacon wrote,  "Human knowledge and human power meet in one; for where the cause is not known the effect cannot be produced. Nature to be commanded must be obeyed; and that which in contemplation is as the cause is in operation as the rule."&lt;ref&gt;Francis Bacon, ''[[Novum Organum]]'', Part I, Aphorism III. Boston:  Taggard &amp; Thompson, 1863, volume  VIII, pp. 67–68.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ralph Waldo Emerson ===
[[Ralph Waldo Emerson]] wrote in his essay ''Old Age'', included in the collection ''Society and Solitude'' (1870):

{{quote|''Skill to do comes of doing; knowledge comes by eyes always open, and working hands; and there is no knowledge that is not power.''&lt;ref&gt;Ralph Waldo Emerson, ''Society and Solitude'', 1892, [https://archive.org/stream/acj9362.0001.001.umich.edu#page/302/mode/2up p. 303]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== Wissen ist Macht in Germany ===
After the 1871, [[unification of Germany]], "''Wissen ist Macht, geographisches Wissen ist Weltmacht''" (Knowledge is power, geographical knowledge is world power) was often used in German geography and the public discussion to support efforts for a [[German colonial empire]] after 1880. [[Justus Perthes|Julius Perthes]] e.g., used the motto for his [[Justus Perthes (publishing company)|publishing house]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.welt.de/print-welt/article638877/Geographie-als-Weltmacht.html | title=Geographie als Weltmacht  Klett und Perthes werben für ein "Museum der Erde" in Gotha | publisher=Die Welt | date=24 June 1997 | accessdate=29 August 2014 | author=ALEXANDER U. MARTENS}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the installation of geographical research followed popular requests and was not imposed by the government.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Especially [[Count Otto von Bismarck|Count Bismarck]] was not much interested in German colonial adventures; his envoy [[Gustav Nachtigal]] started with the first protective areas, but was more interested in ethnological aspects.

After World War I, German geography tried to contribute to efforts to regain a world power. Scholars like [[Karl Haushofer]], a former general, and his son [[Albrecht Haushofer]] (both in close contact with Rudolf Hess) got worldwide attention with their concept of geopolitics. Associations of German geographers and school teachers welcomed the [[Machtergreifung]] and hoped to get further influence in the new regime.

The postwar geography was much more cautious; concepts of political geography and projection of power had not been widespread scholarly topics till 1989 in Germany.

Geographical knowledge is however still of importance in Germany. Germans tend to mock US politicians' and celebrities' comparable lack of interest in the topic. A Sponti ([[Außerparlamentarische Opposition]]) version of the slogan is "Wissen ist Macht, nichts wissen, macht auch nichts", a pun about the previous motto along the line "Knowledge is power, but being ignorant doesn't bother anyway". [[Joschka Fischer]] and [[Daniel Cohn-Bendit]] belong to those Spontis that nevertheless held powerful positions, in Fischer's case with no more formal education than a taxi driver's licence.

The German Bundeswehr Bataillon Elektronische Kampfführung 932, an [[electronic warfare]] unit based in [[Frankenberg (Eder)]], still uses the Latin version ''Scientia potentia est'' as its motto.

==Interpretation==
{{unreferenced section|date=February 2017}}
Though its meaning varies from author to author, the phrase often implies{{according to whom|date=February 2017}} that with knowledge or [[education]], one's potential or abilities in life will certainly increase. Having and sharing knowledge is widely recognized as the basis for improving one's reputation and influence, thus power. This phrase may also be used as a justification for a reluctance to share information when a person believes that withholding knowledge can deliver to that person some forms of advantage. Another interpretation is that the only true power is knowledge, as everything (including any achievement) is derived from it.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7577">{{Nofootnotes|article|date=February 2008}}
In contemporary [[mereology]], a '''simple''' is any thing that has no proper parts. Sometimes the term "atom" is used, although in recent years{{when?|date=January 2010}} the term "simple" has become the standard. 

Simples are to be contrasted with [[Gunk (mereology)|atomless gunk]] (where something is "gunky" if it is such that every proper part has a further proper part). Necessarily, given the definitions, everything is either composed of simples, gunk or a mixture of the two. Classical mereology is consistent with both the existence of gunk and either finite or infinite simples (see Hodges and Lewis 1968).

Given a mereology containing the [[null individual]], no object other than the null individual would be simple.

==The Simple Question==
Mirroring the [[special composition question]] is the Simple Question.&lt;ref&gt;Markosian 1998&lt;/ref&gt; It asks what the jointly necessary and sufficient conditions are for ''x'' to be a mereological simple. In the literature this question explicitly concerns what it is for a material object to lack proper parts, although there is no reason why similar questions cannot be asked of things from other [[ontological]] categories.

There have been many suggested answers to the Simple Question. Answers include that ''x'' is a simple if and only it is a point-sized object; that ''x'' is a simple if and only if it is indivisible; or that ''x'' is a simple if and only if it is maximally continuous. Kris McDaniel has argued that what it is for an object to be a simple is a matter of brute fact, and that there is no non-trivial answer to the Simple Question (2007b).

==Extended simples==
Of those philosophers who believe the material world contains simples, there has recently been debate over whether there can be extended simples (see Braddon-Mitchell and Miller 2006, Hudson 2006, Markosian 1998, 2004, McDaniel 2007a, 2007b, McKinnon 2003, Parsons 2000, Sider 2006, Simons 2004 ''inter alia''). An extended simple is (i) a material object; (ii) simple, and (iii) it occupies an extended region of space.

Various reasons have been offered in favor of the claim that extended simples are possible, including: (a) that they are conceivable (Markosian 1998), (b) that purportedly plausible modal principles claiming, roughly, that there are no necessary connections between distinct existences [[logical consequence|entail]] their possibility (McDaniel 2007a, Saucedo 2009, Sider 2006), and (c) that contemporary physical theories entail that there are extended simples (Braddon-Mitchell and Miller 2006). One might also argue in favor of the possibility of extended simples by noting that their existence is consistent with the answer to the Simple Question one endorses. In the literature, however, the reasoning is often reversed: Those who think that extended simples are possible often use their purported possibility to argue against answers to the Simple Question that entail their impossibility and those who think that they are impossible uses their purported impossibility to argue against answers to the Simple Question that entail (or strongly suggest) their possibility.

There have been arguments against extended simples. Arguments include variants on Lewis' argument from temporary intrinsics, as well as arguments that intuitively an extended object must have, for instance, a right half and a left half, and thus have parts (cf Zimmerman 1996: 10) Similarly, one who endorses the [[Doctrine of Arbitrarily Undetatched Parts]], which states that necessarily, if an object occupies region ''R'' then every occupiable proper sub-region of ''R'' is exactly occupied by a proper part of that object (see van Inwagen 1981), might use that principle in an argument against the possibility of extended simples.

If there are no extended simples, the only remaining options would material objects being made of unextended simples (objects that have a space-time extension of 0) or atomless gunk.

Some philosophers seem to have held that the whole universe is one enormous extended simple. According to some interpretations of Descartes and Spinoza, for instance, they held this view. More recently, this view has been defended in Schaffer 2007.

==Non-material simples==
The use of 'simple' is not restricted to material objects. Anything, no matter what ontological category it is from, is a simple if and only if it has no proper parts. Thus Lewis has argued that singletons are simples (Lewis 1991) and spacetime points are often thought to be simples (although in some non-standard spacetimes, points have proper parts). Similarly, there is a question of whether things from other categories--for instance, fictional characters and properties, if there are such things--are simples. Furthermore, just as every material object may be made of atomless gunk rather than simples, so too for objects from other ontological categories. For instance, some have held that spacetime is gunky, claiming that every region of spacetime has a proper sub-region.

'''Sir Stuart Newton Hampshire''' (1 October 1914 – 13 June 2004) was an [[Oxford University]] [[philosopher]], [[literary critic]] and university administrator.&lt;ref&gt;Jane O'Grady, [https://www.theguardian.com/obituaries/story/0,3604,1239568,00.html Obituary: Sir Stuart Hampshire], ''[[The Guardian]]'', 16 June 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; He was one of the [[rationalism|antirationalist]] Oxford thinkers who gave a new direction to moral and political thought in the post-[[World War II]] era.

Hampshire was born in [[Healing, Lincolnshire]], the son of George Newton Hampshire, a fish merchant in nearby [[Grimsby]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite ODNB|id=94197|title=Hampshire, Sir Stuart Newton}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hampshire was educated at Lockers Park School (where he overlapped with Guy Burgess), [[Repton School]] and [[Balliol College, Oxford]], where he matriculated as a [[history]] scholar. He did not confine himself to history, switching instead to the study of [[literae humaniores|Greats]] and immersing himself in the study of [[painting]] and literature. As was the culture at Balliol, his intellectual development owed more to his gifted contemporaries than to academic tutors. Having taken a first class degree, in 1936 he was elected to a Fellowship of [[All Souls College, Oxford]], where he researched and taught [[philosophy]] initially as an adherent of [[logical positivism]]. He participated in an informal discussion group with some of the leading philosophers of his day, including [[J. L. Austin]], [[H. L. A. Hart]], and [[Isaiah Berlin]].

In 1940, at the outbreak of [[World War II]] he enlisted in the [[army]] and was given a commission. Due to his lack of physical aptitude he was seconded to a position in [[military intelligence]] near [[London]] where he worked with Oxford colleagues such as [[Gilbert Ryle]] and [[Hugh Trevor-Roper]]. His encounters as interrogator with [[Nazism|Nazi]] officers at the end of the war led to his insistence on the reality of [[evil]].

After the war, he worked for the government before resuming his career in philosophy. From 1947 to 1950, he taught at [[University College, London]], and was subsequently a fellow of [[New College, Oxford]]. His study ''[[Spinoza (book)|Spinoza]]'' was first published in 1951.  In 1955, he returned to [[All Souls College, Oxford|All Souls]], as a resident fellow and domestic bursar.

His innovative book ''[[Thought and Action]]'' (1959) attracted much attention, notably from his Oxford colleague [[Iris Murdoch]].&lt;ref&gt;See Iris Murdoch 'Existentialists and Mystics' (London, [[Chatto &amp; Windus]] 1997)  A critique of Hampshire emerges most strongly in 'The Idea of Perfection', ''Yale Review'' Spring 1964&lt;/ref&gt; It propounded an ''intentionalist'' theory of the [[philosophy of mind]] taking account of developments in [[psychology]]. Although he considered most continental philosophy vulgar and fraudulent, Hampshire was much influenced by [[Maurice Merleau-Ponty]]. He insisted that philosophy of mind "has been distorted by philosophers when they think of persons only as passive observers and not as self-willed agents". In his subsequent books, Hampshire sought to shift [[moral philosophy]] from its focus on the logical properties of moral statements to what he considered the crucial question of ''moral problems as they present themselves to us as practical agents.''

In 1960, Stuart Hampshire was elected a member of the [[British Academy]] and became [[Grote Chair of the Philosophy of Mind and Logic|Grote Professor of the Philosophy of Mind and Logic]] at University College London, succeeding [[Alfred Ayer|A. J. Ayer]]. His international reputation was growing and from 1963 to 1970 he chaired the department of philosophy at [[Princeton University]] to which he had happily escaped from the robust atmosphere of London to which his mandarin style, conveyed in a rather preposterous growling accent, was ill-suited, as Ayer implied in his memoirs.  In 1970, he returned to Oxford as [[Warden of Wadham College]], Oxford.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wadham.ox.ac.uk/about-wadham/college-history/wardens-of-wadham.html Wardens of Wadhem], [[Wadham College, Oxford]], UK.&lt;/ref&gt; His [[classical liberalism|liberal]] and [[democratic socialism|socialist]] views were apparent when Wadham was in the first group of men-only Oxford colleges to admit women in 1974. Hampshire considered his wardenship to be one of his most significant achievements in reviving the fortunes of the college. He was knighted in 1979 and retired from Wadham in 1984, when he accepted a professorship at [[Stanford University]].&lt;ref&gt;See P. M. S. Hacker, "Thought and Action: A Tribute to Stuart Hampshire", ''Philosophy'' 80 (2005), pp. 175–197, at p. 177.&lt;/ref&gt;

His last book, ''Justice Is Conflict'' (1999), inaugurated the ''Princeton Monographs in Philosophy'' series.

Stuart Hampshire wrote extensively on literature and other topics for the ''[[Times Literary Supplement]]'' and the ''[[New York Review of Books]]'' amongst others. He was head of the literary panel of the [[Arts Council]] for many years. In 1965–6, he was selected by the UK government to conduct a review of the effectiveness of [[Government Communications Headquarters|GCHQ]].

He married his first wife, Renée Ayer, the former wife of the philosopher [[A. J. Ayer]], in 1961. She died in 1980, and in 1985 he married [[Nancy Cartwright (philosopher)|Nancy Cartwright]], who was then his colleague at Stanford and is now Professor of Philosophy at [[Durham University]] and at the [[University of California, San Diego]].

'''Svabhava''' ({{lang-sa|svabhāva}}; {{lang-pi|sabhāva}}; {{zh|c=自性|p=zìxìng}}; {{bo|t=རང་བཞིན|w=rang-bzhin}})&lt;ref&gt;Dharma Dictionary (2008). rang bzhin. Source: [http://rywiki.tsadra.org/index.php/rang_bzhin] (accessed: January 29, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt; literally means "own-being" or "own-becoming". It is the intrinsic nature, essential nature or essence of living beings.

The concept and term ''svabhāva'' are frequently encountered in Hindu and Buddhist traditions such as [[Advaita Vedanta]] (e.g. in the ''[[Avadhuta Gita|Avadhūta Gītā]]''), [[Mahayana|Mahayana Buddhism]] (e.g. in the ''[[Ratnagotravibhāga]]''), [[Vaishnavism]] (e.g., the writings of [[Ramanuja]]) and [[Dzogchen]] (e.g. in the [[seventeen tantras]]).

In the nondual Advaita Vedānta yoga text, ''Avadhūta Gītā'', [[Brahman]] (in the Upanishadic denotation) is the ''sabhāva''.

In the Mahāyāna Buddhadharma tradition(s) it is one of a suite of terms employed to denote the [[Buddha-nature]], such as "''[[gotra]]''".&lt;ref&gt;Ruegg, D. Seyfort (1976). 'The Meanings of the Term "Gotra" and the Textual History of the "Ratnagotravibhāga"'. Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London, Vol. 39, No. 2 (1976), pp. 341–363&lt;/ref&gt;

==Indian philosophy==
The term first appears in the [[Shvetashvatara Upanishad]], as a possible first cause (''jagatkāraṇa'').&lt;ref&gt;Ramkrishna Bhattacharya, ''Svabhāvavada'' and the Cārvāka/Lokāyata: A Historical Overview&lt;/ref&gt; There also seems to have been an Indian philosophical position called ''Svabhāvavada'' which was akin to [[Naturalism (philosophy)|naturalism]] which held that "things are as their nature makes them".&lt;ref&gt;M. Hiriyanna, Outlines of Indian Philosophy, p. 103.&lt;/ref&gt; It is possible this position was similar to or associated with [[Charvaka|Carvaka]].&lt;ref&gt;Ramkrishna Bhattacharya, ''Svabhāvavada'' and the Cārvāka/Lokāyata: A Historical Overview&lt;/ref&gt;

===Samkhya===
In early [[Samkhya]] philosophy, Svabhava was a term which was associated with [[Prakṛti]].&lt;ref&gt;Gerald James Larson, Classical Sāṃkhya: An Interpretation of Its History and Meaning, p.114&lt;/ref&gt; It is the inherent capacity of [[Prakṛti]], which is independent and self caused.&lt;ref&gt;Knut A. Jacobsen, Prakr̥ti in Samkhya-yoga: Material Principle, Religious Experience, Ethical Implications, 1999, p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Vaishnavism===
The ''[[Bhagavad Gita|Bhagavad Gītā]]'' (18.41) has nature (''svabhava'') as a distinguishing quality differentiating the ''[[Varna (Hinduism)|varṇā]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Source: {{cite web |url=http://vedabase.net/bg/18/41/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-04-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100616084818/http://vedabase.net/bg/18/41/ |archivedate=2010-06-16 |df= }} (accessed: Tuesday April 6, 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

Overzee (1992: p.&amp;nbsp;74) in her work on [[Pierre Teilhard de Chardin]] (1881–1955) and [[Ramanuja|Rāmānuja]] (1017–1137) highlights Rāmānuja's usage of ''svabhāva'' in relation to Brahman thus:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Let us look more closely at what Rāmānuja means by the Lord's "nature". If you read his writings, you will find that he uses two distinct yet related words when referring to the nature of Brahman: ''svarūpa'' and ''svabhāva''.&lt;ref&gt;Overzee, Anne Hunt (1992). ''The body divine: the symbol of the body in the works of Teilhard de Chardin and Rāmānuja''. Issue 2 of Cambridge studies in religious traditions. Cambridge University Press. {{ISBN|0-521-38516-4}}, {{ISBN|978-0-521-38516-9}}.

==Buddhism==
In early [[Theravada|Theravādin]] texts, the term "''svabhāva''" did not carry the technical meaning or the soteriological weight of later writings. Much of Mahayana Buddhism (as in the ''[[Prajnaparamita|Prajñāpāramitā Sūtra]]'') denies that such a ''svabhāva'' exists within any being; however, in the [[tathāgatagarbha sūtras]], notably the ''[[Mahāyāna Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra]]'', the Buddha states that the immortal and infinite Buddha-nature - or "true self" of the Buddha - is the indestructible ''svabhāva'' of beings.

===Theravāda===
In the [[Pāli Canon]], ''sabhāva'' is absent from what are generally considered to be the earliest texts. When found in later texts (e.g., the [[paracanonical texts (Theravada Buddhism)|paracanonical]] ''[[Milinda Panha|Milindapañha]])'', it generically refers to state (of mind), character or truth.

In the post-canonical [[abhidharma|Abhidhamma]] literature, ''sabhāva'' is used to distinguish an irreducible, [[Pratītyasamutpāda|dependent]], momentary [[dharma|phenomenon]] (''dhamma'') from a conventionally constructed object.  Thus, a collection of visual and tactile phenomena might be mentally constructed into what is conventionally referred to as a "table"; but, beyond its constituent elements, a construct such as "table" lacks intrinsic existence  (''sabhāva'').

According to Peter Harvey, svabhava in the Theravada Abhidhamma is something conditional and interdependent:
{{quote|"They are dhammas because they uphold their own nature [sabhaava]. They are dhammas because they are upheld by conditions or they are upheld according to their own nature" (Asl.39). Here 'own-nature' would mean characteristic nature, which is not something inherent in a dhamma as a separate ultimate reality, but arise due to the supporting conditions both of other dhammas and previous occurrences of that dhamma. This is of significance as it makes the Mahayana critique of the Sarvastivadin's notion of own-nature largely irrelevant to the Theravada.&lt;ref&gt;Harvey, Peter; INTRODUCTION TO BUDDHISM, page 97&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== Vaibhāṣika ===
The [[Sarvastivada|Vaibhāṣika]] school held that dharmas have a constant [[essence]] or inherent nature (''svabhāva'') which persists through past, present and future.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Westerhoff, The Golden Age of Indian Buddhist Philosophy in the First Millennium CE, 2018, p. 70.&lt;/ref&gt; The term was also identified as a unique mark or own characteristic (''svalaksana'') that differentiated a dharma and remained unchangeable throughout its existence. According to Vaibhāṣikas, ''svabhavas'' are those things that exist substantially (''dravyasat'') as opposed to those things which are made up of aggregations of dharmas and thus only have a nominal existence (''prajñaptisat'').&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

===Madhyamaka===
Robinson (1957: p.&amp;nbsp;300) in discussing the [[Buddhist logic]] of [[Nagarjuna|Nāgārjuna]], states:
{{quote|''Svabhāva'' is by definition the subject of contradictory ascriptions. If it exists, it must belong to an existent entity, which means that it must be conditioned, dependent on other entities, and possessed of causes. But a ''svabhāva'' is by definition unconditioned, not dependent on other entities, and not caused. Thus the existence of a ''svabhāva'' is impossible.&lt;ref&gt;Robinson, Richard H. (1957). Some Logical Aspects of Nagarjuna's System. ''Philosophy East &amp; West''. Volume 6, no. 4 (October 1957). University of Hawaii Press. Source: {{cite web |url=http://www.orientalia.org/printout470.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-03-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041127175124/http://www.orientalia.org/printout470.html |archivedate=2004-11-27 |df= }} (accessed: Saturday March 21, 2009), p.300&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Dzogchen===
Dzogchen upholds a view of ''niḥsvabhāva'', refuting ''svabhāva'' using the same logic employed by Madhyamaka, a freedom from extremes demonstrated succinctly via [[Catuṣkoṭi]] [[Tetralemma]]. 
{{quote|As it ([[rigpa]]) transcends awareness and non-awareness, there are not even the imputations of awareness. This is called the Dzogpa Chenpo, free from extremes.&lt;ref&gt;Thondup Rinpoche, Tulku (1989). ''The Practice Of Dzogchen''. Ithaca, New York: Snow Lion. {{ISBN|1-55939-054-9}}, p.103&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In the context of logical analysis, Dzogchen agrees with the view of [[Madhyamaka]] as elucidated by [[Nāgārjuna]], Chögyal [[Namkhai Norbu]] explains:

{{quote|...Madhyamaka explains with the four "beyond concepts," which are that something neither exists, nor does not exist, nor both exists and does not exist, nor is beyond both existing and not existing together. These are the four possibilities. What remains? Nothing. Although we are working only in an intellectual way, this can be considered the ultimate conclusion in Madhyamaka. As an analytical method, this is also correct for Dzogchen. Nagarjuna's reasoning is supreme.&lt;ref&gt;Namkhai Norbu, Chögyal (2006). ''Dzogchen Teachings''. Ithaca, New York: Snow Lion. {{ISBN|1-55939-243-6}}, p.55&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The ''Union of the Sun and Moon'' ({{bo|t=ཉི་ཟླ་ཁ་སྦྱོར|w=nyi zla kha sbyor}}), one of the '[[Seventeen tantras]] of the esoteric instruction cycle' ({{bo|t=མན་ངག་སྡེའི་རྒྱུད་བཅུ་བདུན|w=man ngag sde'i rgyud bcu bdun}}) which are a suite of tantras known variously as: [[Nyingtik]], [[Upadesha]] or [[Menngagde]] within [[Dzogchen]] discourse, states:

{{quote|Whoever meditates on the absence of nature [svabhāva]&lt;br&gt;
in objects that are objective appearances&lt;br&gt;
this is the non-duality of appearance and emptiness,&lt;br&gt;
the relaxed unimpeded group of six.&lt;ref&gt;Source: [https://www.scribd.com/doc/28606591/Union-of-the-Sun-Moon-1-of-the-17-Upadesha-Tantras Union of the Sun and Moon (Wylie: nyi zla kha sbyor)] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121102145302/http://www.scribd.com/doc/28606591/Union-of-the-Sun-Moon-1-of-the-17-Upadesha-Tantras |date=2012-11-02 }} (accessed: Friday March 19, 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;}}&lt;br&gt;

====Bonpo Dzogchen====
''Svabhāva'' is very important in the [[nontheistic]] [[theology]] of the [[Bonpo]] Great Perfection (Dzogchen) tradition where it is part of a technical language to render macrocosm and microcosm into [[nonduality]], as Rossi (1999: p.&amp;nbsp;58) states:
{{quote|The View of the Great Perfection further acknowledges the ontological identity of the macrocosmic and microcosmic realities through the threefold axiom of Condition (ngang), Ultimate Nature (rang bzhin) and Identity (bdag nyid). The Condition (ngang) is the Basis of all (kun gzhi) -- primordially pure (ka dag) and not generated by primary and instrumental causes. It is the origin of all phenomena. The Ultimate Nature (rang bzhin) is said to be unaltered (ma bcos pa), because the Basis [gzhi] is spontaneously accomplished (lhun grub) in terms of its innate potential (rtsal) for manifestation (rol pa). The non-duality between the Ultimate Nature (i.e., the unaltered appearance of all phenomena) and the Condition (i.e., the Basis of all) is called the Identity (bdag nyid). This ''unicum'' of primordial purity (ka dag) and spontaneous accomplishment (lhun grub) is the Way of Being (gnas lugs) of the Pure-and-Perfect-Mind [byang chub (kyi) sems].&lt;ref&gt;Rossi, Donatella (1999). ''The Philosophical View of the Great Perfection in the Tibetan Bon Religion''. Ithaca, New York: Snow Lion. {{ISBN|1-55939-129-4}}, p.58&lt;/ref&gt;}}

====The Mirror of the Mind of Samantabhadra====
The term "''svabhāva''" is mentioned in six verses of the first chapter of the ''[[Avadhuta Gita|Avadhūta Gītā]]'': [[s:Avadhuta Gita/Chapter 1#verse5|1.5]], [[s:Avadhuta Gita/Chapter 1#verse6|1.6]], [[s:Avadhuta Gita/Chapter 1#verse44|1.44]], [[s:Avadhuta Gita/Chapter 1#verse54|1.54]], [[s:Avadhuta Gita/Chapter 1#verse58|1.58]], [[s:Avadhuta Gita/Chapter 1#verse76|1.76]].

This extreme nondual yoga text shares a lot of common language with the extreme nondual yoga of [[Atiyoga]] (Dzogchen) and its standard Tibetan analogue ''rang-bzhin'' (Wylie) is employed in ''[[The Mirror of the Mind of Samantabhadra]],'' one of the ''[[Seventeen Tantras]]'' of Atiyoga [[Upadesha]].

Dzogchen strictly refutes the notion of "''svabhāva''", and so ''[[The Mirror of the Mind of Samantabhadra]],'' states specifically that [[dharmakāya]] is non-arisen and natureless:

{{quote|...this meaningful supreme wisdom kāya&lt;br&gt;
ultimate, natureless [rang bzhin med], the state of the nonarising dharmakāya,&lt;br&gt;
the lamp of the teachings, the great light of the dharmakāya&lt;br&gt;
manifests to persons who are in accord with the meaning.&lt;ref&gt;'Kun tu bzang po thugs kyi me long gi rgyud'. Source: [http://wikisource.org/wiki/Kun_tu_bzang_po_thugs_kyi_me_long_gi_rgyud] (accessed: Monday April 5, 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;}}&lt;br&gt;

The following quotation from ''The Mirror of the Mind of Samantabhadra'' is drawn from the [[Lungi Terdzö]]:{{refn|group=lower-alpha|The Lungi Terdzö (Wylie: ''lung-gi gter-mdzod'') is the prose autocommentary by [[Longchenpa]] (1308–1364 or possibly 1369) to his'' [[Chöying Dzö]]'' (Wylie: ''chos-dbyings mdzod'') -- which are numbered amongst the ''[[Seven Treasuries]]'' (Wylie: ''mdzod chen bdun''). This text is rendered into English by [[Richard Barron|Barron]], ''''et al.'''' (2001: p.&amp;nbsp;8) and the Wylie has been secured from Wikisource and interspersed and embedded in the English gloss for [[:wikt:probity|probity]]}}
{{quote|You should understand that the nature of all phenomena is that of the five aspects of Samantabhadra.&lt;br&gt;

====Namkhai Norbu====
[[Dzogchen]] teacher [[Namkhai Norbu]] (2001: p.&amp;nbsp;155) in discussing the view of the [[pratyekabuddha]]s states that: 
{{quote|... the Pratyekabuddhas accede to the absence of a self or independent self-nature (bdag med).&lt;ref&gt;Norbu, Namkhai (2001).  ''The Precious Vase:  Instructions on the Base of Santi Maha Sangha'' (Shang Shung Edizioni, 2nd rev. ed., trans. from the Tibetan, edited and annotated by Adriano Clemente with the help of the author; trans. from Italian into English by Andy Lukianowicz), p. 155. Note that the [http://rywiki.tsadra.org/index.php/Main_Page Dharma Dictionary] (2008) equates the Tibetan ''bdag-med'' with ''[[anātman]]'' (Sanskrit) (Dharma Dictionary, 2008, ''bdag med'', retrieved January 29, 2008 from http://rywiki.tsadra.org/index.php/bdag_med).&lt;/ref&gt;}}

'''The British Society for the Philosophy of Religion''' (registered charity 1027548) was founded in 1993 and is the [[United Kingdom]]'s main forum for the interchange of ideas in the [[philosophy of religion]]. The current president is [[Yujin Nagasawa]] of the [[University of Birmingham]].

The Society holds a major conference in Britain every two years, devoted to a particular area of the subject. The programme of events for the Society is decided at the General Meeting held at the Biennial Conference. The planning of the programme is in the hands of the Committee.

The BSPR is also affiliated to the [[European Society for Philosophy of Religion]] which holds a biennial conference in years alternating with the BSPR’s conference.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is an ecological exercise using the intricate web of the [[natural environment]] rather than thinking as an isolated individual.



==Origins of the term==
Aldo Leopold first came   up with this term as a result of watching a wolf die off. In those days of Leopold’s adventures, no one would ever pass up killing a wolf because fewer wolves meant more deer, which meant great hunting experiences. However, when Leopold saw the “fierce green fire dying in her eyes” he knew that neither the mountain nor the wolf deserved this. Leopold stated in his book, ''[[A Sand County Almanac]]'':

{{cquote| Since then I have lived to see state after state extirpate its wolves. I have watched the face of many a newly wolfless mountain, and seen the south-facing slopes wrinkle with a maze of new deer trails. I have seen every edible bush and seedling browsed, first to anaemic desuetude, and then to death. I have seen every edible tree defoliated to the height of a saddlehorn … In the end the starved bones of the hoped-for deer herd, dead of its own too-much, bleach with the bones of the dead sage, or molder under the high-lined junipers … So also with cows. The cowman who cleans his range of wolves does not realize that he is taking over the wolf’s job of trimming the herd to fit the change. He has not learned to think like a mountain. Hence we have dustbowls, and rivers washing the future into the sea.}}
In this example Leopold shows that the removal of a single species can result in serious negative consequences in an ecosystem. While avoiding [[trophic cascade]]s is one way to think like a mountain, there are countless other environmental actions that can be categorized under this broad and interconnected concept.

==Examples in antiquity==
Although the term was not coined until 1949, several philosophers of the ancient times had viewpoints similar to those who “think like a mountain”. [[Epicurus]] was one of the first ancient philosophers to view the role man plays in nature. His philosophy, [[Epicureanism]], is a materialistic viewpoint that aims to explain the physical earth.

[[Lucretius]] was a later philosopher who had Epicurean ideals. He wrote a six book collection, ''De Rerum Natura'', categorizing the natural word. In Book 5 of ''De Rerum Natura'' he writes:

{{cquote| They [Roman gods] did not create the world for us [man], why should they? They did not create man, how could they? They had no conception of man until nature and natural causes (the union of atoms) showed them the way. Besides the gods were absolutely happy as they were, and the creating of man could not increase their happiness. After numberless attempts and numberless failures the concourse of atoms gradually formed the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

  | last2 = Lowe
  | title = De Rerum Natura, a Selection from the Fifth Book
  | year = 1907
  |publisher = Oxford, Clarendon Press
}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In this passage, Lucretius is defining man’s place in the creation of the world. Lucretius is an Epicurean supporter, believing that living modestly and gaining knowledge of the working world were the keys to a more pleasurable life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

  | title = Epicureanism
  | year = 2010
  | publisher = Acumen
  | isbn = 978-1-84465-170-2
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Aristotle]] also philosophized about man’s place in the ecosystem. In his [[Politics (Aristotle)|Politics]], he discusses the role of community as used when referring to cities, neighborhoods, and households. The idea of thinking like a mountain is primarily ecological, but it can be applied to politics as well. Aristotle provides resources for citizens on how they as individuals fit into their community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
  | first = Trevor
  | last = Saunders
  | title = Aristotle's Politics
  | year = 1995
  |publisher = Oxford University Press
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other ancient philosophers approach the idea of viewing one’s place in the ecosystem as well. They include [[Sophocles]], a [[Greek philosopher]], and [[Columella]], a Roman philosopher.  Sophocles writes in Antigone about natural law and legal institutions. In his eyes, the laws of the [[List of Greek mythological figures|gods]] outweigh those of man and man must understand his place in the order of natural law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

  | year = 2008
  |publisher = Brill
  | isbn = 978-90-04-16514-4
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Columella, in contrast to the Epicureans, believes that in order to make the most efficient use of the land, humans should not rely on the gods, but should become more educated and learn to use resources more efficiently.

==Contemporary examples==
In much the same way that [[Rachel Carson]]’s bellwether manuscript ''[[Silent Spring]]'' changed the realm of how and which chemicals are used in nature, [[Aldo Leopold]] forever changed the way we view our ecological impact on the environment around us with the introduction of the term “Thinking Like a Mountain” in his book [[A Sand County Almanac]]&lt;ref name=sand1114/&gt; in 1949.  Since then, the phrase and the particular mindset it generates has greatly influenced people in all walks of life.

==Books==
[[Philip Connors]] has attempted to further Leopold’s elucidation with respect to matters of the environment through literature.  In many of his books, most notably ''Fire Season'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
  | last = Connors
  | first = Philip
  | title = Fire Season: Field Notes from a Wilderness Lookout
  | publisher = [[Harper Collins]] Publishers
  | year = 1992
  | isbn = 978-0-06-185936-6
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Connors alludes to thinking like a mountain when he urges the reader to think about more than just the costs and benefits an action has on their person. He believes that everyone who witnesses the environment should have the goal of achieving what Leopold spoke of when he describes living in harmony with nature.  Connors said, {{cquote| We touch the ancient mysteries of life in the wild. We may even learn to see in new ways — more closely, perhaps, and deeper into geologic time. If we’re lucky we get close to learning how to ‘think like a mountain,’ in Aldo Leopold’s great phrase.}}

Another author, Leslie Thiele refers to thinking like a mountain in multiple chapters in his book Indra’s Net and the Midas Touch.&lt;ref name=profthiele1114/&gt;  Within one chapter, Thiele explains how thinking like a mountain is, first and foremost, an ecological principle for a sustainable existence.  Later, he also cites this sort of living as a basis for environmental ethics. Thiele summarizes his view of thinking like a mountain as {{cquote|a full appreciation of the vast and intricate web of interdependent relationships that constitute a mountain oikos.&lt;ref name=profthiele1114/&gt;}}

==Film==
The idea of thinking like a mountain has also permeated its way into the world of full length movies and documentaries.  ''Green Fire'', released in 2011, is a documentary about Aldo Leopold’s influence on modern environmentalism and revolves around the concept of thinking like a mountain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media |date=2011 |title=Green Fire: Aldo Leopold and a Land Ethic for Our Time |medium= film|publisher= Aldo Leopold Foundation, the [[Center for Humans and Nature]], and the US Forest Service }}&lt;/ref&gt; The name ''Green Fire'' was meant to capture the image of Leopold’s dying she wolf and the passion with which he pursued environmental justice and ecological balance throughout his life.

Filmmaker Alexander Hick spent several months in 2017 among the [[Arhuaco]] community in the [[Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta]], Colombia, filming a feature documentary titled "Thinking Like A Mountain" with his brother Immanuel Hick as Director of Photography. The film will be released at the International Film Festival Nyon "[[visions du reel]]" on April 15th 2018.

==Music==
The mindset of thinking like a mountain has been infused into music as well.  Folk artist [[Libby Roderick]] has used the idea of thinking like a mountain as a foundation for her album ''Thinking Like a Mountain''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media notes
| others    = Libby Roderick
| date      = 1994
| title     = Thinking Like a Mountain
| location  = Alaska
}}&lt;/ref&gt; In one song in particular, Roderick equates thinking like a mountain to being safe, home, or complete.  Also, she ends each stanza with “Thinking like a mountain, honey, we will make it home” as if to say that eventually we will all think with a long-term perspective and get our lives back on a safe and sustainable track.  Furthermore, Roderick ends the song with an ultimatum for each of our lives. {{cquote|Find the mountain deep within your heart, it's calling you back home!}}

'''Wilhelm Gottlieb Tennemann''' (7 December 1761 – 30 September 1819) was a [[Germany|German]] [[historian of philosophy]].

==Life==
He was born and educated at [[Erfurt]]. In 1788, he became a lecturer on the [[history of philosophy]] at the [[University of Jena]]. Ten years later he became a professor at the same university, where he remained till 1804. His great work is an eleven-volume history of philosophy (''Geschichte der Philosophie''), which he began at Jena and finished at the [[University of Marburg]], where he was professor of philosophy from 1804 till his death. He was one of the numerous German philosophers who accepted the [[Immanuel Kant|Kantian]] theory as a revelation.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

In 1812 he published a shorter history of philosophy (''Grundriss der Geschichte der Philosophie für den akademischen Unterricht''), which was translated into English in 1852 under the title [https://archive.org/details/amanualhistoryp01moregoog ''A manual of the history of philosophy''].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

He died at [[Marburg]].

'''William Torrey Harris''' (September 10, 1835 – November 5, 1909) was an American [[educator]], [[philosopher]], and [[lexicographer]].&lt;ref name=obit/&gt;

==Biography==
Born in [[Killingly, Connecticut|North Killingly]], [[Connecticut]], he attended Phillips Andover Academy, [[Andover, Massachusetts]].  He completed two years at Yale, then moved west and taught school in [[St. Louis, Missouri]], from 1857 to 1880, where he was superintendent of schools from 1868 to 1880, and established, with [[Susan Blow|Susan E. Blow]], America's first permanent public kindergarten in 1873. It was in St. Louis where William Torrey Harris instituted many influential ideas to solidify both the structural institution of the public school system and the basic philosophical principles of education.  
His changes led to the expansion of the public school curriculum to make the high school an essential institution to the individual and to include art, music, scientific and manual studies, and was also largely responsible for encouraging all public schools to acquire a library.

As Commissioner of Education, Harris wrote the introduction to then Commissioner of Indian Affairs, Thomas Jefferson Morgan's, Bureau of Education Bulletin (No. 1, 1889) on Indian Education. Harris called for the forced and mandatory education of American Indians through a partnership with Christianity in order to promote industry. It was Harris who called for the removal of Native children from their families for up to 10 years of training for the "lower form of civilization" as opposed to the United States government's policy of exterminating them. Harris wrote, "We owe it to ourselves and to the enlightened public opinion of the world to save the Indian, and not destroy him. We can not save him and his patriarchal or tribal institution both together. To save him we must take him up into our form of civilization. We must approach him in the missionary spirit and we must supplement missionary action by the aid of the civil arm of the State. We must establish compulsory education for the good of the lower race."

Harris's St. Louis Schools were considered some of the best in the country. His fellow educators were local farmers that immigrated from Germany after they tried and failed to make Germany a republic.

In St. Louis Harris met mechanic and philosopher [[Henry Clay Brockmeyer]], whose influence turned him towards [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegelianism]]. With Brockmeyer and other of the [[St. Louis Hegelians]], he founded and edited the first [[philosophical]] [[periodical]] in America, the ''Journal of Speculative Philosophy'' (1867), editing it until 1893.  it promoted the view that the entire unfolding was part of a universal plan, a working out of an eternal [[historical dialectic]], as theorized by Hegel.

Harris was associated with [[Amos Bronson Alcott]]'s [[Concord School of Philosophy]] from 1880 to 1889, when he became [[U.S. Commissioner of Education]], serving until 1906. He did his best to organize all phases of education on the principles of philosophical [[pedagogy]] as espoused by [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]], [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]], [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte|Fichte]], [[Friedrich Fröbel|Fröbel]], [[Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi|Pestalozzi]] and many others of [[idealist]] philosophies.

He died on November 5, 1909.&lt;ref name=obit&gt;{{cite news |author= |coauthors= |title=William Torrey Harris Dead |url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1909/11/06/101041132.pdf |quote=William Torrey Harris, former United States Commissioner of Education died here to-night. Mr. Harris' work in educational lines gained for him intentional ... |newspaper=[[New York Times]] |date=November 6, 1909 |accessdate=2014-02-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Significance===
He received the degree of [[Doctor of Laws|LL.D.]] from various American and foreign universities.

As the United States Commissioner of Education, Harris nearly succeeded in making Hegelianism the official philosophy of American education during the late 19th century.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

Throughout time, his influence has been only momentarily recognized, disregarded and misunderstood by historians.
Harris’ extreme emphasis on discipline has become the most glaring misrepresentation of his philosophy.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

==Honors==

[[Harris–Stowe State University]] in St. Louis is named for Harris, and author [[Harriet Beecher Stowe]].

In 1906 the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching conferred upon him "as the first man to whom such recognition for meritorious service is given, the highest retiring allowance which our rules will allow, an annual income of $3000."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The National Cyclopaedia of American Biography|date=1967|publisher=University Microfilms|location=Ann Arbor, MI|page=2|edition=Vol. 15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable quotations==
"Ninety-nine [students] out of a hundred are automata, careful to walk in prescribed paths, careful to follow the prescribed custom. This is not an accident but the result of substantial education, which, scientifically defined, is the subsumption of the individual."

And in that same book, ''The Philosophy of Education'' (1906), he writes:

"The great purpose of school can be realized better in dark, airless, ugly places ... It is to master the physical self, to transcend the beauty of nature. School should develop the power to withdraw from the external world."

Critics&lt;ref&gt;http://www.spinninglobe.net/lessons.htm&lt;/ref&gt; cite these passages to portray Harris as a proponent of self-alienation in order to better serve the great industrial nation of America. In fact, argue supporters{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}, it can be found that quite the opposite is true of Harris when you are able to go beyond the surface of his educational philosophy. According to Harris's supporters, as a devout Christian he was quite concerned with the development of morality and discipline within the individual. Harris believed those values could systematically be instilled into the pupils, promoting common goals and social cooperation, with a strong sense of respect for and responsibility towards one’s society.

Harris was a strong proponent of the American colonial projects in Cuba, Puerto Rico and the Philippines following the Spanish–American War. In an article entitled "An Educational Policy for Our New Possessions", Harris wrote:

“…[I]f the other people of the world to the number of some fourteen hundred millions are united under the five great powers of Europe, while we in turn have only one hundred millions, our national idea will be threatened abroad and have more dangers than ever at home.” “We must accept the charge of as many of these colonies as come to our hand. We must seek to give them civilization in the highest sense that we can conceive of it.”  
“The highest ideal of a civilization is that of a civilization that is engaged constantly in elevating lower classes of people into participation of all that is good and reasonable and perpetually increasing at the same time their self-activity. Such a civilization we have a right to ''enforce'' on this earth [emphasis added].”

==Achievements==
[[File:William Torrey Harris 1.jpg|right|180px|thumb]]
He was also assistant editor of ''Johnson’s New Universal Cyclopaedia'' and editor of ''Appletons' International Education Series''. He expanded the [[Bureau of Education (National)|Bureau of Education]] and started graphic exhibits of the United States in [[international expositions]].

He was responsible for introducing [[reindeer]] into [[Alaska]] so that the native [[whaler]]s and [[animal trapping|trapper]]s would have another livelihood, before they brought other species to [[extinction]].

Harris was one of the 30 founding members of the [[Simplified Spelling Board]], founded in 1906 by [[Andrew Carnegie]] to make English easier to learn and understand through changes in the [[orthography]] of the [[English language]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9F02E5D6103EE733A25751C1A9659C946797D6CF&amp;scp=1 "CARNEGIE ASSAULTS THE SPELLING BOOK; To Pay the Cost of Reforming English Orthography. CAMPAIGN ABOUT TO BEGIN Board Named, with Headquarters Here -- Local Societies Throughout the Country."], ''[[The New York Times]]'', March 12, 1906. Accessed August 28, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

As editor-in-chief of ''[[Webster's Dictionary|Webster's New International Dictionary]]'' (1909), he originated the divided page.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

In the book ''The Educational Philosophy of William T. Harris'' by Richard D. Mosier, it is stated  that Harris forms the bridge between the mechanism, associationism, and utilitarianism of the 18th century and the pragmatism, experimentalism, and instrumentalism of the 20th century.

William Torrey Harris took [[Francis_Bacon#Organization_of_knowledge|Bacon]]’s original ideas on the organization of information for libraries and modernized them to be applied in the United States by the second half of the 1800s. William Harris, who worked creating a library catalog for the Public Library School of St. Louis, wrote an essay on creating an organization system for libraries. It wasn’t the first one in America, but it was an scheme that gained international reputation rapidly. Harris used a deductive hierarchy and created a structure better adapted to the interrelation of knowledge, which facilitated its application in libraries’ catalogs. Harris proposed a practical system of rules for the classification going from the generic to the specific. Those rules included main divisions, ultimate divisions, appendixes, and hybrids. The problem with Bacon’s approach was the difficulty to limit all knowledge within a restricted classification. Conversely, Harry suggested that content is predominant in minor divisions and sections , while form is the “guiding principle&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Harris |first1=William |title=Book Classification |journal=The Journal of Speculative Philosophy |volume=4 |issue=2 |page=114-129 |url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/25665714}}&lt;/ref&gt;” in the main divisions.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1901">[[File:Nagasaki Sofukuji M5564.jpg|left|thumb|Sōfuku-ji's Daiippōmon]]The [[Obaku (school of Buddhism)|Ōbaku school]] of Zen arrived in Japan in the middle of the seventeenth century, several  centuries after the other Zen schools, and as a consequence its temples typically have a different architecture, based on Chinese [[Ming Dynasty|Ming]] and [[Qing Dynasty|Qing]] architectures.&lt;ref name="niho35"&gt;Nishi, Hozumi (1996:35)&lt;/ref&gt;

A great example of the style is [[Manpuku-ji]] in Uji, near Kyoto, whose main building, the Daiyūhōden, was built in 1668.

Another important Ōbaku temple is [[Sōfuku-ji (Nagasaki)|Sōfuku-ji]], built in 1629 in Nagasaki by Chinese immigrants.&lt;ref name="niho35"/&gt; The Daiippō[[Mon (architecture)|mon]], a [[National Treasures of Japan|National Treasure]], was built in 1644 by Chinese carpenters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Jaanus2|d/daiippoumon|Daiippoumon|4-14-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rebuilt in 1694 with material imported from China, it is one of the best examples of the style.&lt;ref name="niho35"/&gt; Painted in typically Chinese [[polychromy]], it has four-step brackets ("[[tokyō]]") in the front and back, and ordinary three-step brackets on the sides.&lt;ref name="niho35"/&gt;
