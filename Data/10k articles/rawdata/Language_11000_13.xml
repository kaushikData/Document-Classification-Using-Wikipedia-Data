'''Across Language Server''' is a software platform for [[Computer-assisted translation|computer-assisted translation (CAT)]] that includes additional features for the management of projects. The software is produced and sold by [[Across Systems|Across Systems GmbH]], a company located and founded in [[Karlsbad (Baden)|Karlsbad]] in 2005 as a [[Corporate spin-off]] of [[Nero AG]] and which maintains an additional site in [[Glendale, California]].

The functional principle is similar to the one [[SDL Trados]], XTM and [[memoQ]] feature: Just like the server solutions of these two programs, Across Language Server also saves translation units or terminology entries (depending on the project's configuration) into a local or a central MSSQL database.

Besides the "Server", which is available in different versions, there is also a single-user version called ''Across Translator Edition'', working with a local MS-SQL database. This single-user application is able to connect to the server, enabling to work on both local and Across-Server-based projects. Freelance translators can acquire the ''Basic Edition'' of the single-user version for free.

== History ==
Version 5 of the MS-SQL-database-based Across Language Server was launched in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://multilingual.texterity.com/multilingual/20091011?pg=16#pg16 Review of Across Language Servers by Richard Sikes] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029191745/http://multilingual.texterity.com/multilingual/20091011?pg=16#pg16 |date=October 29, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Version 6 of Across Language Server was released on 2 July 2014.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.across.net/unternehmen/news-pressemeldungen/ansicht/die-welt-spricht-v6-neueste-version-des-across-language-server-ab-sofort-verfuegbar/&lt;/ref&gt; Version 6.3 was introduced on 26 November 2015.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.across.net/en/news/across-language-server-v63-new-collaboration-options/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Anil Acharya''' is an Indian [[Bengali people|Bengali]] essayist, short story writer and poet. In 1966, he founded the [[Bengali language|Bengali]] literary quarterly and [[Little magazine movement|little magazine]] ''Anustup''.&lt;ref name=CalcuttaYellowPages&gt;[http://www.calcuttayellowpages.com/adver/108702editors-profile.html Anustup website's profile of the editor. Retrieved on 9 September 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
Acharya graduated with an honors degree in English literature from the [[Scottish Church College]].&lt;ref&gt;''Some Alumni of Scottish Church College'' in ''175th Year Commemoration Volume''. Scottish Church College, April 2008, p. 588.&lt;/ref&gt; Thereafter he earned his master's degree in English literature from the University of Calcutta. He started publishing the literary quarterly ''Anustup'' as an undergraduate student at Scottish Church College in 1966.&lt;ref name=CalcuttaYellowPages/&gt;

==Career==
Since his college days, he has written poems, short stories and essays in Bengali and English. After earning a postgraduate degree in English literature, he started out as a lecturer, and later became a reader and then associate professor in English at the [[Serampore College]], within the aegis of the [[University of Calcutta]].&lt;ref name=CalcuttaYellowPages/&gt; He was also Head of the Department of English and set up the Communicative English programme in Serampore College.

He is a member of the Publisher and Bookseller's Guild, the organisers of the Kolkata Book Fair, which is Asia's largest book fair and the most attended book fair in the world. He was elected Secretary of the Guild for three successive terms, between 1996-1998, and during his tenure, the noted French Philosopher Jacques Derrida inaugurated the Kolkata Book Fair in 1997.

He has spent a life in writing and editing his quarterly journal, and has also founded an English language literary periodical for translated short stories from Bengali, called ''Harvest''.&lt;ref name=CalcuttaYellowPages/&gt; In 1970, he assisted the Australian director [[Paul Cox (director)|Paul Cox]] as the assistant director in making the documentary on Calcutta. He was also the associate producer of Paul Cox's film "Force of Destiny" released in 2014. He is currently associated with St. Thomas' College of Engineering and Technology, Kolkata.&lt;ref name=PaulCox&gt;[http://www.paulcox.com.au/site/item.cfm?item=5FFF5055C29F442E670EB862A4A55DE9 Calcutta]{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between February 2013 and February 2015, he wrote a regular Sunday column in the Bengali newspaper 'Ei Somoy', called "Nipaatone Siddho". It documented the myriad experiences, that played out across four decades in the Bengali cultural and political landscape, and shaped Anustup and what it stands for. He is also the author of the Bengali book titled "Parasmaipadi" which is a collection of his selected articles.

==About ''Anustup''==
''Anustup'' is a literary journal.&lt;ref&gt;''No Revolutionary but Editor of a Revolutionary Paper'' in ''Samar Sen''. Nityapriya Ghosh, Sahitya Akademi, 2001, p. 77.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1972, it was the first to have an independent publishing wing. True to the vision of "Little Magazine" movement that emerged in the 70's in Bengal, its aim is to publish works that established publishers would overlook. The editorial board wanted to promote promising authors and new genres of writing. Due to the initial efforts of this journal, many others followed suit and this led to a qualitative improvement in terms of production in contemporary Bengali literature.&lt;ref name=littlemag&gt;[http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2012-07-01/kolkata/32494033_1_special-edition-publishing-tagore/2 The New Golden Age Retrieved 8 October 2013]&lt;/ref&gt; Since its inception, ''Anustup'' has seen the likes of contributions from [[Amiya Bagchi]], [[Partha Chatterjee (scholar)|Partha Chatterjee]], [[Ashis Nandy]], [[Shankha Ghosh]], Gautam Bhadra, [[Hemanga Biswas]] and [[Ranajit Guha]].&lt;ref name=Flashback&gt;[http://www.telegraphindia.com/1080720/jsp/calcutta/story_9559837.jsp Little things mean a lot] Retrieved 8 October 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recognition==
In recognition of his efforts, in 2012, he was appointed as a ''Tagore National Scholar'' by the [[Ministry of Culture (India)|Ministry of Culture]] of the [[Government of India]].&lt;ref name=NL&gt;[http://www.nationallibrary.gov.in/nat_lib_stat/pdfs/NewsLetter%20Jan_Jun%202012.pdf National Library Kolkata newsletter]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bixby''' is a [[Virtual assistant (artificial intelligence)|virtual assistant]] developed by [[Samsung Electronics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bixby|url=http://www.samsung.com/global/galaxy/apps/bixby/|website=Samsung|accessdate=7 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 20, 2017, Samsung announced the voice-powered digital assistant named "Bixby".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Bixby : A New Way to Interact with Your Phone|url=https://news.samsung.com/global/bixby-a-new-way-to-interact-with-your-phone|website=SAMSUNG Newsroom|access-date=5 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bixby was introduced alongside the [[Samsung Galaxy S8|Samsung Galaxy S8 and S8+]], as well as the [[Samsung Galaxy Tab series|Samsung Galaxy Tab A]] during the Samsung Galaxy Unpacked 2017 event, which was held on March 29, 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Pham|first1=Sherisse|title=Samsung's new AI assistant will take on Siri and Alexa|url=http://money.cnn.com/2017/03/21/technology/samsung-bixby-ai-s8-note-7-apple-google/index.html|accessdate=30 March 2017|work=[[CNNMoney]]|date=21 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Baig|first1=Edward|title=Samsung promises its Galaxy S8 Bixby assistant will be 'fundamentally different'|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/columnist/baig/2017/03/20/samsung-promises-its-galaxy-s8-bixby-assistant-viv-labs/99409962/|accessdate=30 March 2017|work=[[USA Today]]|date=20 March 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Samsung]] officially unveiled Bixby a week before launch but it only made its first appearance during the event.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://venturebeat.com/2017/03/29/everything-samsung-announced-at-its-2017-unpacked-launch-event/|title=Everything Samsung announced at its Unpacked 2017 launch event|date=2017-03-29|website=VentureBeat|access-date=2017-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bixby can also be [[Sideloading|sideloaded]] on older Galaxy devices running Android Nougat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Schoon|first1=Ben|title=Here’s how to install Bixby and the Galaxy S8’s new launcher on other Samsung devices|url=https://9to5google.com/2017/04/03/how-to-install-bixby-on-galaxy-s7/|website=9to5Google|accessdate=4 April 2017|date=3 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bixby represents a major reboot for [[S Voice]], Samsung's voice assistant app introduced in 2012 with the [[Samsung Galaxy S III|Galaxy S III]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.androidauthority.com/samsung-galaxy-s8-bixby-digital-assistant-s-voice-748940/|title=Galaxy S8's Bixby assistant to be based on S-Voice, not Viv Labs tech|publisher=Android Authority|author=Scott Adam Gordon|date=10 February 2017|access-date=5 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2017/2/10/14573954/samsung-ai-assistant-bixby-viv-s-voice|title=So, what is Samsung's Bixby AI assistant really made of?|work=[[The Verge]]|first=James|last=Vincent|date=10 February 2017|access-date=5 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2017, Samsung announced that Bixby would be coming to its line of Family Hub 2.0 refrigerators, making it the first non-mobile product to include the virtual assistant.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2017/5/15/15640542/samsung-bixby-assistant-smart-hub-2-0|title=Samsung’s Bixby assistant is coming to smart fridges|last=Carman|first=Ashley|date=15 May 2017|work=[[The Verge]]|access-date=20 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2017, Samsung announced the release of Bixby 2.0 during its annual developer conference in San Francisco. The new version is set to be rolled out across the company’s line of connected products, including smartphones, TVs, and refrigerators. Moreover, third parties will be allowed to develop applications for Bixby using the Samsung Developer Kit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://techcrunch.com/2017/10/18/bixby-2-0-takes-center-stage-at-samsungs-developer-conference/|title=Bixby 2.0 takes center stage at Samsung’s Developer Conference|last=Heater|first=Brian|work=TechCrunch|access-date=2017-11-07|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Features==
Bixby comes with three parts, known as ''Bixby Voice'', ''Bixby Vision'' and ''Bixby Home''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cnet.com/news/samsung-bixby-assistant-galaxy-s8-hands-on/|title=Samsung Galaxy S8's Bixby assistant needs to grow up fast|last=Dolcourt|first=Jessica|date=2017-03-29|work=[[CNET]]|access-date=2017-03-30|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bixby Voice===
With ''Bixby Voice'', the user can trigger Bixby by calling it or doing a long press of the Bixby Button located below the volume rocker. A while before the phone's release, the Bixby Button was reprogrammable and could be set to open other applications or assistants, such as [[Google Assistant]]. Near the phone's release, however, this ability was removed with a firmware update, but can be remapped using third party apps.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-bixby|title=What is Bixby and is it like Google Assistant?|last=Karner|first=Jen|date=2017-03-29|work=Android Central|access-date=2017-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bixby Vision===
''Bixby Vision'' is built into the camera app and can "see" what one can see as it is essentially an augmented reality camera that can identify objects in real time, search for them on various services, and offer the user to purchase them if available. Bixby is also able to translate text, read QR codes, and recognize landmarks.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/29/15097744/samsung-bixby-galaxy-s8-assistant-vs-siri-alexa-android|title=Three things we know Samsung’s new assistant can do on the Galaxy S8|last=Bohn|first=Dieter|date=2017-03-29|work=The Verge|access-date=2018-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bixby Home===
''Bixby Home'' can be found by swiping to the right on the home screen or doing a short press on the Bixby Button. It is a vertically scrolling list of information that Bixby can interact with, for example, weather, fitness activity, and buttons for controlling their smart home gadgets.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Bixby supports three languages including Chinese.

[[Samsung Electronics|Samsung]] reported that Bixby would not be operational on the [[United States|US]] version of the [[Samsung Galaxy S8|Samsung Galaxy S8 and S8+]] when the devices were first shipped to consumers on April 21, 2017. [[Samsung Electronics|Samsung]] stated that the key features of Bixby, including Vision, Home and Reminder, would be available with the global launch of the smartphones. Bixby Voice was intended to be made available in the [[United States|US]] on the [[Samsung Galaxy S8|Galaxy S8 and S8+]] later that spring.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cnet.com/news/samsung-bixby-voice-assistant-wont-ship-with-galaxy-s8/|title=Samsung Galaxy S8 hits launch snag with Bixby voice assistant|date=2017-04-11|work=CNET|access-date=2018-08-30|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the release of the English version was postponed as Samsung had problems getting Bixby to fully understand the language.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.androidpolice.com/2017/05/31/wsj-samsungs-english-language-bixby-rollout-delayed-english-hard/|title=WSJ: Samsung's English-language Bixby rollout delayed because English is hard|last=Whitwam|first=Ryan|date=2017-05-31|work=Android Police|access-date=2018-08-30|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Bulaka River''' languages are a pair of closely related [[Papuan languages]], [[Yelmek language|Yelmek]] and [[Maklew language|Maklew]], on the [[Bulaka River]] in Indonesian [[West Papua (region)|West Papua]]. They are ethnically Yab (Jab); their speech is ''Yabga (Jabga)''.  Ross (2005) tentatively includes them in the proposed [[Trans-Fly – Bulaka River languages|Trans-Fly – Bulaka River]] family, but Usher, who reconstructs the family, retains Bulaka River as a primary language family.&lt;ref&gt;[https://sites.google.com/site/newguineaworld/families/bulaka-river]&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2018, multiple media outlets broke news of Cambridge Analytica's business practices. ''[[The New York Times]]'' and ''[[The Observer]]'' reported that the company had [[Facebook–Cambridge Analytica data breach|acquired and used personal data about Facebook users]] from an external researcher who had told Facebook he was collecting it for academic purposes. Shortly afterwards, [[Channel 4 News]] aired undercover investigative videos showing Nix boasting about using prostitutes, bribery [[sting operation]]s, and [[honey trapping|honey traps]] to discredit politicians on whom it conducted [[opposition research]], and saying that the company "ran all of (Donald Trump's) digital campaign".

A minimum of 15 million dollars has been invested into the company by Mercer, according to ''The New York Times''.&lt;ref name="Rosenburg M"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/19/us/cambridge-analytica-alexander-nix.html |first=Matthew |last=Rosenberg |title=Cambridge Analytica, Trump-Tied Political Firm, Offered to Entrap Politicians |date=19 March 2018 |accessdate=19 March 2018 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bannon's stake in the company was estimated at 1 to 5 million dollars, but he divested his holdings in April 2017 as required by his role as [[White House Chief Strategist]].&lt;ref name="BWandAK"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mcclatchydc.com/news/politics-government/white-house/article200917134.html |first1=Ben |last1=Wieder |first2=Anita |last2=Kumar |title=Bannon sold Cambridge Analytica stake, fined for late ethics report |work=[[McClatchy]] |date=20 February 2018 |accessdate=20 March 2018 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2018, [[Rebekah Mercer|Jennifer Mercer]] and [[Mercer Family Foundation|Rebekah Anne Mercer]] became directors of Emerdata limited.&lt;ref name="directors"&gt;{{cite web |title=Appoinment as directors |date=16 March 2018 |url=https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/company/10911848/filing-history |publisher=Companies house |accessdate=23 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In March 2018 it became public by [[Whistleblower]] [[Christopher Wylie]], that Cambridge Analytica's first activities where founded on a data set, which its parent company SCL bought 2014 from a company named Global Science Research founded by [[Aleksandr Kogan]]&lt;ref&gt;Hannes Grassegger und Mikael Krogerus, in: [[Tages-Anzeiger]]: [https://www.tagesanzeiger.ch/ausland/europa/Ich-habe-nur-gezeigt-dass-es-die-Bombe-gibt/story/17474918 «Ich habe nur gezeigt, dass es die Bombe gibt» (I only showed, that there is a bomb)] , 3. 20th 2018&lt;/ref&gt; who worked as an psychologist at Cambridge.

Per the Associated Press, [[Data Propria]], a data analysis firm launched May 2018, is run by former officials at Cambridge Analytica.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/ap-trump-2020-working-with-ex-cambridge-analytica-staffers/2018/06/15/ebdde7e2-70c0-11e8-b4d8-eaf78d4c544c_story.html |title=AP: Trump 2020 working with ex-Cambridge Analytica staffers |author=Jeff Horwitz |date=15 June 2018 |work=Associated Press |via=WashingtonPost.com |access-date=18 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.scmagazine.com/data-propria-heir-to-cambridge-analytica-working-for-rnc-possibly-trump-campaign/article/774206/ |title=Data Propria, heir to Cambridge Analytica, working for RNC, possibly Trump campaign |author=Teri Robinson |date=18 June 2018 |website=scmagazine.com |access-date=18 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.accesswire.com/500425/CloudCommerce-Launches-Data-Propria-Inc-Its-New-Data-Analytics-Division |title=CloudCommerce Launches Data Propria, Inc., Its New Data Analytics Division |author= |date=May 29, 2018 |website=accesswire.com |access-date=18 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2018, several former Cambridge Analytica staff launched [[Auspex International]], a company intended to influence politics and society in Africa and the Middle East.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.wired.co.uk/article/wired-awake-130718&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-44807093&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theinquirer.net/inquirer/news/3035777/cambridge-analyticas-latest-wants-your-google-search-history&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://boingboing.net/2018/07/11/zombie-analytica.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ft.com/content/1c8a5e74-6901-11e8-8cf3-0c230fa67aec&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ft.com/content/d92164fe-8514-11e8-96dd-fa565ec55929&lt;/ref&gt;

==Methods==
CA's data analysis methods were to a large degree based on the academic work of Michal Kosinski. In 2008, Kosinski had joined the Psychometrics Centre of [[Cambridge University]] where he then developed with his colleagues a profiling system using general online data, Facebook-likes, and [[smartphone]] data.&lt;ref name=Magazin&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.dasmagazin.ch/2016/12/03/ich-habe-nur-gezeigt-dass-es-die-bombe-gibt/ |author=Mikael Krogerus, Hannes Grassegger |title=Ich habe nur gezeigt, dass es die Bombe gibt |publisher=[[Das Magazin]] |language=German |date=3 December 2016 |accessdate=7 December 2016 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1073/pnas.1218772110 |title=Private traits and attributes are predictable from digital records of human behavior |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences |volume=110 |issue=15 |page=5802 |year=2013 |last1=Kosinski |first1=M |last2=Stillwell |first2=D |last3=Graepel |first3=T|pmc=3625324 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He showed that with a limited number of "likes", people can be analysed better than friends or relatives can do and that individual psychological targeting is a powerful tool to influence people.&lt;ref name=Magazin/&gt;

CA would collect data on voters using sources such as [[demographics]], [[consumer behaviour]], [[Computer and network surveillance|internet activity]], and other public and private sources. According to ''[[The Guardian]]'', CA used psychological data derived from millions of Facebook users, largely without users' permission or knowledge.&lt;ref name=guardian&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/dec/11/senator-ted-cruz-president-campaign-facebook-user-data |author=Davies, H |title=Ted Cruz using firm that harvested data on millions of unwitting Facebook users |work=The Guardian |date=11 December 2015 |accessdate=7 February 2016 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another source of information was the "Cruz Crew" [[mobile app]] that tracked physical movements and contacts and according to the [[Associated Press]], invaded personal data more than previous presidential campaign apps.&lt;ref name= ap0216&gt;{{cite news |url=http://bigstory.ap.org/article/2db0fc93cf664a63909e26e708e91c67/cruz-app-data-collection-helps-campaign-read-minds-voters |first1=Michael |last1=Biesecker |first2=Julie |last2=Bykowicz |title=Cruz app data collection helps campaign read minds of voters |agency=[[Associated Press]] |date=11 February 2016 |accessdate=13 February 2016 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

So we model the personality of every adult across the United States, some 230 million people.|author=Alexander Nix, chief executive of Cambridge Analytica |source=October 2016.&lt;ref name=Sky2016/&gt;}}

The company claimed to use "data enhancement and [[audience segmentation]] techniques" providing "[[psychographic]] analysis" for a "deeper knowledge of the target audience". The company uses the [[Big Five personality traits|Big Five model]] of personality &lt;ref name=wpost/&gt;&lt;ref name=ca/&gt; Using what it calls "[[behavioral targeting|behavioral]] [[microtargeting]]" the company indicates that it can predict "[[needs]]" of subjects and how these needs may change over time. Services then can be individually targeted for the benefit of its clients from the political arena, governments, and companies providing "a better and more actionable view of their key audiences." According to [[Sasha Issenberg]], CA indicates that it can tell things about an individual he might not even know about himself.&lt;ref name=issenberg/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cbc.ca/passionateeye/episodes/the-persuasion-machine-of-silicon-valley |agency=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation and British Broadcasting Corporation |title=The Persuasion Machine of Silicon Valley |publisher=[[CBC News]] |date=17 February 2018 |accessdate=17 February 2018 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CA derived much of its personality data on [[online survey]]s which it conducts on an ongoing basis. For each political client, the firm would narrow voter segments from 32 different [[personality style]]s it attributes to every adult in the United States. The personality data would inform the tone of the language used in ad messages or voter contact scripts, while additional data is used to determine voters' stances on particular issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://adage.com/article/campaign-trail/cruz-s-data-company-works-night-3m-payout/302515 |title=Cruz's Data Company Works into the Night After Big $3 Million Payout |website=[[Advertising Age]]| access-date = 26 February 2016 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The data would get updated with monthly surveys, asking about political preferences and how people get the information they use to make decisions. It also covered consumer topics about different [[brand engagement|brands and preferred products]], building up an image of how someone shops as much as how they vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dcinno.streetwise.co/2016/02/08/political-ad-targeting-cambridge-analytica-adtech |title=Inside the Tech That Puts Political Ads on Your Screen |website=DC Inno| access-date = 26 February 2016 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Channel 4 News'' investigation===
''[[Channel 4 News]]'', a news programme broadcast by the [[Public service broadcasting in the United Kingdom|British public service]] [[Channel 4]], conducted a four-month investigation into Cambridge Analytica starting in November 2017. An undercover reporter posed as a potential customer for Cambridge Analytica, hoping to help Sri Lankan candidates get elected. Video footage from this operation was published on 19 March 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.channel4.com/news/cambridge-analytica-revealed-trumps-election-consultants-filmed-saying-they-use-bribes-and-sex-workers-to-entrap-politicians-investigation |title=Revealed: Trump's election consultants filmed saying they use bribes and sex workers to entrap politicians |work=Channel 4 News |date=19 March 2018 |accessdate=20 March 2018 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the footage, Cambridge Analytica executives say they worked on over 200 elections across the world.&lt;ref name="dailynation"/&gt; Alexander Nix was recorded in this investigation, talking "unguardedly about the company's practices".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Cadwalladr |first=Carole |authorlink1=Carole Cadwalladr |last2=Graham-Harrison |first2=Emma |title=The Cambridge Analytica Files : 'I made Steve Bannon's psychological warfare tool': meet the data war whistleblower |date=17 March 2018 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/mar/17/data-war-whistleblower-christopher-wylie-faceook-nix-bannon-trump |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |accessdate=19 March 2018 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nix said that his company uses honey traps, bribery stings, and prostitutes, for opposition research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theweek.co.uk/92390/cambridge-analytica-ceo-admits-to-dirty-tricks |title=Cambridge Analytica CEO 'admits to dirty tricks' |work=The Week |date=20 March 2018 |accessdate=20 March 2018 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Nix offered to discredit political opponents in Sri Lanka with suggestive videos using "beautiful Ukrainian girls" and offers of bribes, even if the opponents did not accept the offers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/british-firm-sends-girls-to-entrap-politicians-wpthxqhwv |title=Cambridge Analytica sends 'girls' to entrap politicians |date=20 March 2018 |work=The Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cambridge Analytica said that the video footage was "edited and scripted to grossly misrepresent" the recorded conversations and company's business practices. Nix said that he had "entertained a series of ludicrous hypothetical scenarios", but insisted his company does not engage in entrapment or bribery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Pham |first1=Sherisse |last2=Riley |first2=Charles |url=http://money.cnn.com/2018/03/20/technology/cambridge-analytica-channel-4-report/index.html |title=Cambridge Analytica responds after CEO filmed discussing bribery and entrapment |publisher=CNN |date=20 March 2018 |accessdate=22 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the third part of the series, Nix also said that Cambridge Analytica "ran all the digital campaign" for Trump. Nix stated they used communications that would be self-destructive, leaving no incriminating evidence. After the news segment was broadcast, the board of Cambridge Analytica suspended Nix as chief executive officer. The company also released a statement that the allegations did not represent the ethics of the company, and an independent entity would investigate Nix's statements.&lt;ref name="Lanxon"&gt;{{cite news |last=Lanxon |first=Nate |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-03-20/cambridge-analytica-used-disappearing-emails-in-campaign-report |title=Cambridge Analytica Boasted of Disappearing Emails in Campaigns |work=Bloomberg |date=20 March 2018 |accessdate=20 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The investigation also raised questions regarding campaign finance law. During the 2016 election, the company was employed both by Trump's campaign and Robert Mercer's [[Make America Number 1]] Super [[Political Action Committee|PAC]] which supported Trump. While PACs are not limited in the amount of funds they can spend on behalf of a candidate, they are not allowed to coordinate strategy with the campaigns they are supporting. Nix's statements in the recorded video describe how the Trump campaign itself could "take the high road" and "stay clean", while the negative attacks were handled by the firm and the Super PAC, in a way which makes it "unattributable, untrackable". These statements potentially suggested unlawful coordination between Trump's campaign and the PAC, although Cambridge Analytica has denied this.&lt;ref name="Bump"&gt;{{cite news |last=Bump |first=Philip |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/politics/wp/2018/03/20/a-new-undercover-video-raises-significant-questions-about-cambridge-analyticas-elections-work/ |title=A new undercover video raises significant questions about Cambridge Analytica's elections work |work=The Washington Post |date=20 March 2018 |accessdate=20 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Assessment of impact===
[[File:Cambridge Analytica protest Parliament Square4.jpg|thumb|Canadian whistleblower [[Christopher Wylie]] who was the former director of research at Cambridge Analytica]]
Political scientists have been highly skeptical of claims made by Cambridge Analytica about the effectiveness of its microtargeting of voters (microtargeting refers to the process of "analyzing data to predict the behavior, interests, and opinions held by specific groups of people and then serving them the messages they're most likely to respond to").&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/03/27/the-reclusive-hedge-fund-tycoon-behind-the-trump-presidency |title=The Reclusive Hedge-Fund Tycoon Behind the Trump Presidency |last=Mayer |first=Jane |date=17 March 2017 |work=The New Yorker|access-date=20 March 2018 |issn=0028-792X |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/20/17138854/cambridge-analytica-facebook-data-trump-campaign-psychographic-microtargeting |title=Cambridge Analytica's Facebook data abuse shouldn't get credit for Trump |work=The Verge|access-date=20 March 2018 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Political scientists note that access to digital data is not going to provide significantly more information than from public voter databases, and the digital data has limited value over time as the preferences of voters change.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Political scientists also note that it is hard to infer political values from personality traits, which means that it is easy to mistarget the messages that are sent to voters with specific personality traits.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Research discussed by [[Brendan Nyhan]] of Dartmouth College showed that it is extremely hard to alter voters' preferences because many likely voters are already committed partisans; as a result, it is easier to simply mobilize partisan voters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/13/upshot/fake-news-and-bots-may-be-worrisome-but-their-political-power-is-overblown.html |title=Fake News and Bots May Be Worrisome, but Their Political Power Is Overblown |last=Nyhan |first=Brendan |date=13 February 2018 |work=The New York Times|access-date=20 March 2018 |issn=0362-4331 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Tufts University political scientist Eitan Hersh, who has published on microtargeting in campaigns, has expressed strong skepticism about Cambridge Analytica's methods and their purported effectiveness, saying "Every claim about psychographics etc made by or about [Cambridge Analytica] is BS."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://reason.com/blog/2018/03/19/cambridge-analytica |title=Cambridge Analytica Was Doing Marketing, Not Black Magic |date=19 March 2018 |work=Reason|access-date=19 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, CA claimed that it has psychological profiles of 220 million US citizens based on 5,000 separate data sets.&lt;ref name="InkJun2017"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://fountainink.in/reportage/aadhaar-in-the-hand-of-spies- |title=Aadhaar in the hand of spies Big Data, global surveillance state and the identity project |author=Govind Krishnan V. |date=3 June 2017 |accessdate=27 August 2017 |publisher=Fountain Ink Magazine |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2017, ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported that CA had exaggerated its capabilities: "Cambridge executives now concede that the company never used psychographics in the Trump campaign."&lt;ref name="Confessore" /&gt; Trump aides have also disputed CA's role in the campaign, describing it as "modest" and noting that none of the company's efforts involved psychographics.&lt;ref name="Confessore" /&gt;

According to an aide and consultant for Ted Cruz's presidential campaign, their campaign stopped using CA after its psychographic models failed to identify likely Cruz supporters. The Cruz campaign ceased access to all of Cambridge's data after the [[South Carolina Republican primary, 2016|South Carolina Republican primary]] on 20 February 2016 when Cruz came in third after Trump and Rubio.&lt;ref name=Confessore/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/live/south-carolina-nevada-2016-election/ted-cruz-speaks-after-south-carolina-primary/ |title=Ted Cruz on South Carolina Primary |date=20 February 2016 |work=The New York Times|access-date=21 March 2018 |issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Privacy issues===
The use of [[personal data]] collected without knowledge or permission to establish sophisticated models of user's personalities raises ethical and [[Privacy concerns with social networking services|privacy issue]]s.&lt;ref name=guardian/&gt; CA operated out of the United States; its operations would be illegal in Europe with its stricter [[privacy law]]s.&lt;ref name=ap0216/&gt; While Cruz was outspoken about protecting personal information from the government, his database of CA has been described as "political-voter [[surveillance]]".&lt;ref name="ap0216" /&gt;

Regarding CA's use of Facebook users, a speaker for CA indicated that these users gave permission when signing up with the provider, while Facebook declared that "misleading people or misusing information" is in violation of Facebook's policies.&lt;ref name=guardian/&gt; In 2015, Facebook indicated that it was investigating the matter.&lt;ref name=guardian/&gt; In March 2018, Facebook announced that it had suspended the accounts of Strategic Communication Laboratories for failing to delete data on Facebook users that had been improperly collected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Elizabeth |last=Dwoskin |date=16 March 2018 |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2018/03/16/facebook-bans-trump-campaigns-data-analytics-firm-for-taking-user-data/ |title=Facebook bans Trump campaign's data analytics firm for taking user data |work=[[The Washington Post]] |quote=Facebook said it was suspending the accounts of Strategic Communication Laboratories, the parent company of Cambridge Analytica, as well as the accounts of a University of Cambridge psychologist Aleksandr Kogan, and Christopher Wylie of Eunoia Technologies, Inc.

Alexander Nix suggested that data collection and microtargeting benefits the voters – because they receive messages about issues they care about. However, [[digital rights]] protection groups raised concerns that private information is collected, stored, and shared while individuals are "left in the dark about [it]" and have no control.&lt;ref name=nbcnews&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/2016-election-day/trump-campaign-pays-millions-overseas-big-data-firm-n677321 |first=Kate |last=Brannelly |title=Trump Campaign Pays Millions to Overseas Big Data Firm |publisher=[[NBC News]] |date=4 November 2016 |accessdate=5 November 2016 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Significant backlash against Facebook came to light in March 2018, resulting in controversy as well as a $37&amp;nbsp;billion drop in the [[market capitalization]] of Facebook, as of 20 March.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/business-43462423 |title=Facebook's value falls $37bn amid backlash |date=19 March 2018 |publisher=BBC |access-date=20 March 2018 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the scandal of enabling monetization of Facebook personal data, one assessment was that only 41% of Facebook users trust the company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=Nelson Granados |title=Transparency: How Facebook Can Recover From The Cambridge Analytica Crisis |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/nelsongranados/2018/03/26/transparency-how-facebook-can-recover-from-the-cambridge-analytica-crisis/ |publisher=Forbes |accessdate=26 March 2018 |date=26 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 26 March, the US [[Federal Trade Commission]] announced it is "conducting an open investigation of Facebook Inc's privacy practices following the disclosure that 50 million users' data got into the hands of political consultancy Cambridge Analytica."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=U.S. FTC investigating Facebook's privacy practices |url=http://news.trust.org/item/20180326145505-6je9o/ |work=Reuters |date=26 March 2018 |quote=If the FTC finds Facebook violated terms of the consent decree, it has the power to fine the company thousands of dollars a day per violation, which could add up to billions of dollars.

In 2017 the company had reached out to [[Institutional Revolutionary Party|PRI]], Mexico's ruling political party, in order to bolster the party's presidential campaign during the largest-ever political elections of 2018.

On 4 August 2017, [[Michael Flynn]], who is under investigation by US counterintelligence for his contacts with Russian officials, amended a public financial filing to reflect that he had served in an advisory role in an agreement with CA during the 2016 Trump campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-eyes-michael-flynns-links-to-russia-1485134942 |title=U.S. Eyes Michael Flynn's Links to Russia |first1=Carol E. |last1=Lee |first2=Devlin |last2=Barrett |first3=Shane |last3=Harris |date=23 January 2017 |via=The Wall Street Journal |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 8 October 2017, [[Brad Parscale]], who was the digital media director for Donald Trump's 2016 presidential campaign, stated in an interview with [[Lesley Stahl]] from [[CBS News]] on ''[[60 Minutes]]'' that Parscale was able to utilize Facebook advertising to directly target individual voters in [[swing states]].&lt;ref name=CBSNews&gt;{{Cite news|last=Stahl|first=Lesley|title=Parscale: TV news "thought I was a joke"|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/parscale-tv-news-thought-i-was-a-joke/|work=CBS News|date=8 October 2017|access-date=12 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parscale cited the example in which he was able to target specific universes (audiences) who care about infrastructure and promote Trump and his message to build back up the crumbling American infrastructure.&lt;ref name=SecretWeapon&gt;{{Cite news|title=Secret Weapon|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/video/secret-weapon/|work=CBS News|date=8 October 2017|access-date=12 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although he hired Cambridge Analytica to assist with microtargeting, and Cambridge Analytica stated that it was the key to Trump's victory, Parscale denied that he gained assistance from the firm, stating that he thought Cambridge Analytica's use of psychographics doesn't work.&lt;ref name=Stahl&gt;{{cite news |last=Stahl|first=Lesley|title= Facebook "embeds," Russia and the Trump campaign's secret weapon|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/facebook-embeds-russia-and-the-trump-campaigns-secret-weapon/|work=CBS News|date=8 October 2017|access-date=12 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also denied any assistance with links to Russia.&lt;ref name=Stahl/&gt; According to Parscale, the [[Hillary Clinton presidential campaign, 2016|Clinton Campaign]] turned down assistance from these platforms.&lt;ref name=Stahl/&gt;

On 14 December 2017, it was revealed that [[Robert Mueller]] had requested during the fall of 2017 that Cambridge Analytica turn over the emails of any of its employees who worked on the Trump campaign, as part of his [[Special Counsel investigation (2017–present)|investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/mueller-sought-emails-of-trump-campaign-data-firm-1513296899 |title=Mueller Sought Emails of Trump Campaign Data Firm |last=Ballhaus |first=Rebecca |date=15 December 2017 |work=The Wall Street Journal|access-date=15 December 2017 |issn=0099-9660 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Dream speech''' (in German ''Traumsprache'') is internal speech in which errors occur during a dream. The term was coined by [[Emil Kraepelin]] in his 1906 monograph titled ''Über Sprachstörungen im Traume'' ("On Language Disturbances in Dreams"). The text discussed various forms of dream speech, outlining 286 examples. Dream speech is not to be confounded with the 'language of dreams', which refers to the visual means of representing thought in dreams.{{Citation needed|date=April 2014}}

Three types of dream speech were considered by Kraepelin: disorders of word-selection (also called [[paraphasia]]s), disorders of discourse (e.g. [[agrammatism]]s) and [[thought disorder]]s. The most frequent occurring form of dream speech is a [[neologism]].

Kraepelin studied dream speech because it provided him with clues to the analogous language disturbances of patients with [[schizophrenia]]. Still in 1920 he stated that "dream speech in every detail corresponds to schizophrenic speech disorder."

While Kraepelin was interested in the psychiatric as well as the psychological aspects of dream speech, modern researchers have been interested in speech production in dreams as illuminating aspects of cognition in the dreaming mind. They have found that during dream speech, [[Wernicke's area]] is functioning well, but [[Broca's area]] is not, leading to proper grammar but little meaning.

==The other Kraepelin==
Dream speech opens up a new perspective on the psychiatrist Kraepelin, usually seen as the spiritual father of the [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders|DSM]] system of classification of psychiatric diseases, and of [[biological psychiatry]]. However Kraepelin, one of the first disciples of [[Wilhelm Wundt]], took a lifelong interest in psychology, and even edited a journal ''Psychologische Arbeiten''. One of the booklets of this journal, a 104-page article on dream speech, appeared early in 1906, before the 105-page monograph was published at the end of 1906.

===Dreaming for psychiatry's sake===
In his monograph Kraepelin presented 286 examples of dream speech, mainly his own. After 1906 he continued to collect samples of dream speech until his death in 1926. This time the dream speech specimens were almost exclusively his own and the original hand written dream texts are still available today at the Archive of the [[Max Planck Institute of Psychiatry]] in [[Munich]]. These new dream speech specimens have been published in 1993 in Heynick (in part in English translation) and in 2006 in the original German, with numerous valuable notes added. The second dream corpus has not been censored and dates are added to the dreams. As Kraepelin in 1906 had been collecting dream speech for more than 20 years, he jotted down his dream speech specimens for more than 40 years, with a scientific viewpoint in mind.

Kraepelin's dream speech started during a period (1882–1884) of personal crisis and depression. In 1882 Kraepelin was fired after working only a few weeks at the [[Leipzig]] psychiatric clinic and two months later his father died.

===Schizophrenic speech disorder===
Already in the early years of his career Kraepelin had been confronted with schizophrenic speech disorder - called first ''Sprachverwirrtheit'' then ''schizophrene Sprachverwirrtheit'' and finally [[schizophasia|Schizophasie]] - produced by his patients. But —as Kraepelin states— we can hardly study the schizophasia, because we do not know what the patient is trying to express.

However using the classical dream-[[psychosis]] analogy, he tried to first study dream speech in the hope that this would lead to insights into schizophrenic speech disorder. And so Kraepelin got used to recording his dreams, not to interpret them for personal use as in [[psychanalysis]], but to use them for a scientific study. Kraepelin was not only able to record the deviant speech in his dreams, but also the intended utterance (which was lacking in the deviant speech of his patients, who clearly cannot cross the boundary from psychosis to reality). For example, most neologisms (the deviant utterance) in Kraepelin's dreams have a meaning (the intended utterance).

===Fundamental disturbances===
Kraepelin pointed out two fundamental disturbances underlying dream speech: a diminished functioning of the [[Wernicke area]], and a diminished functioning of those frontal areas in which abstract reasoning is localized. Therefore, individual ideas (''Individualvorstellungen'') get expressed in dreams instead of general ideas. Among these individual ideas he included [[proper names]] in their widest sense.

===Two examples===
Kraepelin's dream speech specimens range from rather simple to extremely intricate. Kraepelin's own analysis is limited in scope. The monograph (available on Google) shows his approach. Several of his dreams can however be analysed in depth. Two examples - one from the second corpus and one from the first and both not analysed by Kraepelin himself - illustrate this.

==== Vi, tafalk!====
On August 13, 1923 Kraepelin jotted down the following example of dream speech:
{{quote|Vi, tafalk!}}

This is, as Kraepelin informs us, an order to the grave digger, named Vi, to bring the coffin for the body during a funeral. Kraepelin notes, that the neologism ''tafalk'' is a shortcut for German ''Katafalk'' (catafalque). Obviously Vi—in the utterance ''Vi, tafalk''—replaces the syllable Ka.

====nsens====
While ''Vi, tafalk!'' is quite easy to analyze, in the same article (p.&amp;nbsp;1290) the authors demonstrate how the associative paths leading to the complex neologism ''nsens'' (in dream specimen no. 107 of Kraepelin's first corpus) can be reconstructed from its origin ''Firmenschild'' (= "company sign").

''Nsens'' derives from the English word "nonsense", once the letters of the word "one" have been deleted. Literally ''nsens'' is ''nonsense - one''. This in its turn links to "crap a ace" ("crap" meaning "nonsense", Greek prefix ''a'' meaning "without" and "ace" meaning "one" in dice games). "Crap a ace" is derived from a [[Metathesis (linguistics)|metathesis]] of "carapace", a typical ''Kraepelin''-word for German ''Schild'' in ''Firmenschild''. In short four association steps link ''Schild''  to ''nsens'':

''Schild''= (1) carapace - (2) crap {{not a typo|a}} ace= (3) nonsense without one - (4) ''nsens''.

The chain shows an alternation of conceptual associations (e.g. synonyms) and word form associations (character and sound associations).

(1) and (3) are conceptual associations, (2) and (4) are word form associations.

Kraepelin himself — ignorant of the code governing his dream speech — termed ''nsens'' an example of "syllable combinations jumbled in a completely arbitrary way." He thinks ''nsens'' is Russian. Kraepelin's false assertion, according to the authors, originates from the associative network in his dreaming brain during the production of ''nsens''. It is Russian ''krepkea'' (''крепкая'' ['krep.kə.jə]), meaning "firm" and so an association to the first part of ''Firmenschild'', that provokes the transformation of "carapace" to "crap a ace". ''Krepkea'' as well as "crap" are ''Kraepelin''-words.

In terms of [[cryptography]] (1) and (3) are [[code]]-type associations, emphasizing meaning, whereas (2) and (4) are [[cipher]]-type associations, emphasizing characters (cf. Pincock &amp; Fary, 2007, p.&amp;nbsp;13).

===The Kraepelin code===
Words like 'carapace', 'krapkea', and 'crap' constitute the 'Kraepelin' code, a set of words that sound like parts of the proper name Kraepelin and influence/direct associational processes. The key role of the proper name can be explained by referring to the so-called [[cocktail party effect]], which states that during a cocktail party we tune in on our discussion partner, neglecting background noise. However, we notice when someone in the background pronounces our name. This cocktail party effect has been replicated in an experimental set up using the [[dichotic listening]] technique. It has been shown that only our proper name tends to break through the attentional barrier, i.e. breaks through amidst other, neglected, sounds offered to the unattended ear. Thus it follows that our proper name is detected even under conditions of low attention. What happens within outer speech during a cocktail-party, likewise occurs within inner speech in dreams. Code words - linked in sound to our proper name - will be detected in the set of potential associations during thinking. The ongoing thinking process will then deviate because code words will act as [[Priming (psychology)|priming]]-words, influencing the direction in which associations will go (Engels, 2005, p.&amp;nbsp;187).

==Chaika vs. Fromkin==
As Kraepelin likened dream speech to schizophasia, what is the current view on the last disorder? While in the famous debate during the '70s between the linguists Elaine Chaika and [[Victoria Fromkin]] on schizophrenic speech, Chaika long held the position that schizophasia was sort of an intermittent [[aphasia]] while Fromkin stated that schizophrenic speech errors could also occur in "normals," the debate has now been ended because according to Chaika (1995)
{{quote|I no longer think that error in [schizophrenic] speech disorder should be necessarily equated with the aphasias which result from actual brain damage.}}

She also thinks that
{{quote|The interpretation of meaning of such speech can be quite different according to whether it is perceived as resulting from a true deficit in language production as opposed to resulting from failed intention.}}

Chaika compares schizophrenic speech errors with intricate speech errors, difficult to analyze. The current Chaika position comes close to Kraepelin's position (1920), who noted that errors as in schizophasia can also occur in normals in dreams.

==Cognitive dream speech research==
At first sight dream speech plays only a marginal role in dream theory. However the important connection of dream and speech is very well illustrated by the following statement of David Foulkes: "However visual dreaming may seem, it may be planned and regulated by the human speech production system." (see e.g. Kilroe, 2001).

Recent research has confirmed one of Kraepelin's fundamental disturbances. In the book [[The Committee of Sleep]], Harvard psychologist [[Deirdre Barrett]] describes examples of dreamed literature—in which the dreamers heard or read words which they awakened later wrote and published. She observes that almost all the examples are of poetry rather than prose or fiction, the only exceptions being one- or several-word phrases such as the Book title ''Vanity Fair'' which came to Thackeray in a dream, or similarly Katherine Mansfield's ''Sun and Moon''. Barrett suggests that the reason poetry fares better in dreams is that grammar seems to be well preserved in dream language while meaning suffers and rhyme and rhythm are more prominent than when awake—all characteristics which benefit poetry but not other forms.

In other work, Barrett has studied verbatim language in college students' dreams and found them similar in these characteristics—intact grammar, poor meaning, rhythm and rhyme—to the literary examples. She observes that this is suggestive that of the two language centers in the brain, ''Wernicke’s area must not be functioning well'', but Broca's area seems to be as this language resembles that of patients with Wernicke's aphasia. Essentially the same conclusion Kraepelin reached in 1906.

'''Drèents''' (also '''Dreins''', '''Dreints''', '''Drents''', '''Drints'''; {{lang-nl|Drents}}) is a collective term for the [[dialect]]s spoken in [[Drenthe]], a [[province]] of the [[Netherlands]]. The dialects, which are still spoken by half the population of Drenthe, are [[Dutch Low Saxon]] variants.

==Dialects of Drèents==
All the dialects of the province of [[Drenthe]] are classified as Dutch Low Saxon. The dialects from the north and the east (see below: 'Noordenvelds' and 'Veenkoloniaals') are somehow more related to [[Gronings]], the dialects from the south-west are 'Stellingwerfs', and the dialects in a few villages along the southern border with the ''Grafschaft'' [[County of Bentheim (district)|Bentheim]] ([[Germany]]) are considered to be [[Sallaans]] (because they have an [[Germanic umlaut|umlaut]] in the diminutives).

The foundation ''Stichting Drentse Taol'' distinguishes seven main variants of Drèents within the province, based upon the research made by G.H. Kocks, the main editor of the ''Woordenboek der Drentse Dialecten'' (Dictionary of the Drèents Dialects):
* ''Noordenvelds''
* ''Veenkeloniaols''
* ''Zuudoost-Zaand-Drèents''
* ''Zuudoost-Veen-Drèents''
* ''Midden-Drèents''
* ''Zuudwest-Noord-Drèents'' (Also see [[Stellingwarfs]])
* ''Zuudwest-Zuud-Drèents''
It also can be divided into Midden-Drents and Zuid-Drents.

'''EIAJ-1''' was a standard for [[video tape recorder]]s (VTRs) developed by the [[Electronic Industries Association of Japan]] with the cooperation and assistance of  several Japanese electronics manufacturers in 1969.  It was the first standardized format for industrial/non-broadcast VTRs using a [[Helical scan]] system employing [[open reel]] tape.  Previously, each manufacturer of machines in this market used a different proprietary format, with differing tape speeds, scanner drum diameters, bias frequencies, tracking head placement, and so on, although most used 1/2" wide tape.  As a result, [[video tape]]s recorded on one make and/or model of VTR could only be interchanged with other machines using that specific format, hampering compatibility.  For example, a reel of tape recorded on a Panasonic machine would not play on a Sony machine, and vice versa.  The EIAJ-1 standard ended this incompatibility, giving those manufacturers a standardized format, interchangeable with almost all VTRs subsequently brought to market around that time.  The format offered [[black-and-white]] (and later colour) video recording and playback on 1/2" [[magnetic tape]] on a 7" diameter [[open reel]], with portable units using smaller 5" diameter reels.

==Uses==

The EIAJ-1 standard paved the way for consumer oriented non-professional [[analog recording|analog video recording]] technology to become more affordable and widespread, with many businesses, schools, government agencies, hospitals, and even some consumers adopting the format in the early 1970s.  Some of the first [[public-access television]] cable stations that started up around that time used EIAJ-1 equipment extensively, due to its portability, low cost, and versatility.  The original Sony [[Portapak]], model [[CV-2000]], used a proprietary format, but was later superseded by an EIAJ-1 compatible version, the AV-3400.

[[Image:Panasonic-half-inch-VTR.jpg|thumb|Panasonic 1/2 inch VTR, Model NV3130 at DC Video, [http://www.dcvideo.com/],]]

==Variations==

When EIAJ-1 was standardized, no [[videocassette recorder]]s had yet been introduced.  One of the main drawbacks to the format was the need to carefully thread the end of the tape around the head drum, through a gap between the capstan and pinch roller, and around a variety of guides and tensioners.  If the user made any errors in doing this, the machine would malfunction and the tape could become damaged.  So, another version, EIAJ-2, was released later on that used a single-reel cartridge (with the take-up reel being built into the VTR) instead of an open take up reel.  Otherwise, the recording specifications were exactly the same.

==Successors==

By 1971, Sony introduced the first successful videocassette system, the [[U-matic]] format.  The U-Matic system offered many advantages over EIAJ-1, including color recording as standard, stereo sound, and automatic tape threading.  However, EIAJ-1 equipment remained popular for a number of years as it was less expensive than U-Matic machines or tape, EIAJ-1 equipment was lighter and more compact, and portable battery operated EIAJ-1 machines with companion video cameras were already available (such as the AV-3400, mentioned above).  It wasn't until the mid 1970s that portable U-Matic machines and compatible portable color cameras were introduced.

Neither the EIAJ-1 nor the U-Matic format were ever used in a [[Camcorder]] (one piece) camera recorder unit, because of the size and weight of the mechanism involved.  The recorder and camera were always separate units, connected by a [[Multicore cable|multi conductor]] cable.  The advent of the camcorder did not occur until the introduction of smaller, lighter cassette formats, such as [[Betamax]] and [[VHS]].

'''Elizabeth Catherine Usher''' AO (1911–1996) was a speech disorders therapist and academic. She was the first person to study [[Speech Therapy|speech therapy]] from [[Queensland]].

== Early life ==
Elizabeth Catherine Molphy (later Usher) was born on 16 November 1911 in [[Lilydale, Victoria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://recordsearch.naa.gov.au/SearchNRetrieve/Interface/ViewImage.aspx?B=5260144|title=E.C.

Elizabeth won a scholarship to train as a teacher attending the Teacher’s Training College in [[Brisbane]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article21398134|title=HOCKEY.|date=1929-04-22|newspaper=Brisbane Courier (Qld. : 1864 - 1933)|access-date=2017-12-12|pages=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; After taking her license, Elizabeth taught at a number of schools, including Kaimkillenbun, Maclagan, Elbow Valley&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article177366837|title=ELBOW VALLEY|date=1933-09-28|newspaper=Warwick Daily News (Qld. : 1919 -1954)|access-date=2017-12-12|pages=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Central School, Warwick from 1928 to 1945.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article191276311|title=Compulsory Subject|date=1946-04-25|newspaper=Warwick Daily News (Qld. : 1919 -1954)|access-date=2017-12-12|pages=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; She took her teaching licence in elocution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=March 10, 1938|title=Personal|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article190545048|journal=Warwick Daily News|volume=March 10, 1938|pages=4|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also took flying lessons at [[Archerfield, Queensland|Archerfield]] before gaining her pilot’s licence in 1936.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=January 13, 1937|title=Flying teacher|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article36899131|journal=The Courier Mail|volume=January 13, 1937|pages=19|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== World War II ==
During [[World War II]], Elizabeth Molphy trained as a signals and cipher officer with the [[Women's Auxiliary Australian Air Force|WAAAF]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article190494469|title=PERSONAL|date=1942-06-04|newspaper=Warwick Daily News (Qld. : 1919 -1954)|access-date=2017-12-12|pages=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; and later in rehabilitation services. She became engaged to Leon Lyons,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=March 3, 1941|title=Of Air Force interest|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article186609514|journal=The Telegraph|volume=March 3, 1941|pages=7|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; a pilot, but he was killed during the War. At the conclusion of the war, she entered a training course offered by the Victorian Council of Speech Therapists.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=January 20, 1952|title=In town and out|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article201520975|journal=The Truth|volume=January 20, 1952|pages=35|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within two years she had completed her Licentiate at the [[Speech Pathology Australia|Australian College of Speech Therapists]], becoming the first Queenslander to study to become a speech therapist.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Professional career ==
Elizabeth Molphy returned to Warwick, Queensland to live with her parents after completing her course and a position as a speech therapist became available with Dr Basil Stafford’s Psychiatric Clinic, a division of the [[The Park Centre for Mental Health|Brisbane Mental Hospital]], in George St, Brisbane.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=April 30, 1948|title=New appointment for Miss E.C.

Elizabeth travelled to England in 1952 to undertake continuing education,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; working as a supply teacher to support this training. She took a [[Bobath concept|Bobath]] therapy course for the treatment of the [[Cerebral palsy|Cerebral Palsy]].&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Elizabeth Usher AO: pioneer speech therapist in Williams, Lesley M.

Ken and Elizabeth Usher moved back to Australia in 1956&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=October 3, 1954|title=On their way home|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article201196803|journal=The Truth|volume=October 3, 1954|pages=40|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and she became the first speech therapist to work full-time at the Queensland Spastic Centre (Cerebral Palsy Alliance). She also resumed her work at the Psychiatric Centre. She saw patients at the [[Mater Health Services|Mater Hospital]] and [[Greenslopes Private Hospital|Greenslopes Repatriation Hospital]]. The workload was considerable and Usher and three other therapists continued to take on new patients including those at the Subnormal Children’s Centre (now [[Endeavour Foundation]]). Usher petitioned for the establishment of a speech therapy course at the [[University of Queensland]], to help provide a facility to train future speech therapists. After a number of years of negotiation, and with the support of the Vice Chancellor, Sir [[Fred Schonell]], a university course was established in 1962.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A place of light and learning: the University of Queensland's first 75 years|last=Thomis|first=Malcolm I.|publisher=University of Queensland Press|year=1985|isbn=0702217972|location=University of Queenslane eSpace|pages=283, 296}}&lt;/ref&gt; Usher taught part-time as a lecturer in the course.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hill|first=Dorothy|year=1974|title=Physiotherapy as a university subject in Queensland|url=https://ac.els-cdn.com/S0004951414611892/1-s2.0-S0004951414611892-main.pdf?_tid=5f593c64-df01-11e7-89bb-00000aacb362&amp;acdnat=1513058453_a09a3f46ad11af0e1f87514568d7a684|journal=The Australian journal of physiotherapy|volume=20 |issue=3|pages=117–128|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1964, the first group of students had completed the diploma and she was promoted to a full-time lecturer. The course was upgraded to a degree program in 1967.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.entwellbeing.com.au/pioneering-a-profession-speech-pathology-in-australia/|title=Pioneering a profession: Speech Pathology in Australia - ENT Wellbeing|date=2014-01-24|newspaper=ENT Wellbeing Sydney|access-date=2017-12-12|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Usher was awarded an honorary Bachelor of Speech Therapy from the University in 1969. She took her B.A. in 1969.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; She was made Head of the Department and Senior Lecturer from 1971 and Reader in 1973. Usher retired from the University in 1977 as an Associate Professor and Head of the Department of Speech and Hearing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://education.qld.gov.au/studentservices/learning/disability/specialists/slt/docs/50-years-speech-language-therapy.pdf|title=50 Years of Speech-Language Therapy in Education Commemorative eBook|last=Department of Education and Training|first=|date=2016|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; She returned to private practice.

'''Ewondo''' or '''Kolo''' is the language of the [[Beti-Pahuin|Ewondo people]] (more precisely  Beti be Kolo or simply Kolo-Beti) of [[Cameroon]]. The language had 577,700 native speakers in 1982. Ewondo is a [[trade language]]. Dialects include Badjia (Bakjo), Bafeuk, Bamvele (Mvele, Yezum, Yesoum), Bane, Beti, Enoah, Evouzok, Fong, Mbida-Bani, Mvete, Mvog-Niengue, Omvang, Yabekolo (Yebekolo), Yabeka, and Yabekanga. Ewondo speakers live primarily in Cameroon's [[Centre Region (Cameroon)|Centre Region]] and the northern part of the Océan division in the [[South Province (Cameroon)|South Region]].

Ewondo is a [[Bantu language]]. It is a dialect of the [[Beti language]] (Yaunde-Fang), and is intelligible with [[Bulu language|Bulu]], [[Eton language|Eton]], and [[Fang language (Cameroon)|Fang]].

In 2011 there was a concern among Cameroonian linguists that the language was being displaced in the country by French.&lt;ref&gt;http://quotidien.mutations-multimedia.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=2962:patrimoine-la-langue-ewondo-a-son-dictionnaire&amp;catid=58:news&amp;Itemid=415&lt;/ref&gt;

The Gospel of Matthew was written using Mark as a source.  Then the Gospel of Luke was written using both Mark and Matthew.]]
The '''Farrer theory''' (also called the Farrer–Goulder hypothesis and Farrer–Goulder–Goodacre hypothesis) is a possible solution to the [[synoptic problem]]. The theory is that the [[Gospel of Mark]] was written first, followed by the [[Gospel of Matthew]] and then by the [[Gospel of Luke]]. 

It has mainly been advocated by English biblical scholars. It is named for [[Austin Farrer]], who wrote ''On Dispensing With Q'' in 1955,&lt;ref&gt;Austin M. Farrer, ''On Dispensing with Q'', in D. E. Nineham (ed.), ''Studies in the Gospels: Essays in Memory of R. H. Lightfoot'', Oxford: Blackwell, 1955, pp. 55-88,&lt;/ref&gt; but it has been picked up by other scholars including [[Michael Goulder]] and [[Mark Goodacre]]. 

==Overview==

The Farrer theory has the advantage of simplicity, as there is no need for hypothetical sources to be created by academics. Instead, advocates of the Farrer theory argue, the Gospel of Mark was used as source material by the author of Matthew. Lastly, Luke used both of the previous gospels as sources for his Gospel.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, Michael Goulder's summary of the hypothesis in "Is Q a Juggernaut?", ''Journal of Biblical Literature'' 115 (1996): 667-81, reproduced at [http://www.markgoodacre.org/Q/goulder.htm http://www.markgoodacre.org/Q/goulder.htm].&lt;/ref&gt;

Farrer set out his argument in an essay "On dispensing with Q".&lt;ref&gt;D. E. Nineham (ed.), Studies in the Gospels: Essays in Memory of R. H. Lightfoot (Oxford: Blackwell, 1955)&lt;/ref&gt; He says that the [[two-source hypothesis]], as set out by Dr B H Streeter thirty years earlier,&lt;ref&gt;Dr B. H. Streeter, The Four Gospels: A Study of Origins (London: Macmillan, 1924)&lt;/ref&gt; "wholly depends on the incredibility [i.e., disbelief] of St Luke having read St Matthew's book", since otherwise the natural assumption would be that one was dependent on the other, rather than that they were both dependent on a further source.

This assumption could be displaced by, for example, identifying material appearing in both Matthew and Luke that was very different from either of them, which, when extracted, appears to be a work in its own right, with a beginning, middle and end. Neither of these factors are found in Q, as reconstructed by scholars. He also says (writing before the publication of the [[Gospel of Thomas]]) that "we have no reason to believe that documents of the Q type were plentiful", which would have made the hypothesis that Matthew and Luke drew on one more likely.

Nor is it obvious, Farrer says, that a book like Q was likely to be produced as a written manual of the teaching of Christ, since the reconstruction of it requires it to also have significant narrative elements interspersed with the teaching, and to have an interest in symbolism from the Old Testament.

==Arguments for and against==

===Arguments for===

In his 1955 paper ''On Dispensing with Q'', Austin Farrer made the case that if Luke had been acquainted with the gospel of Matthew, there would be no need to postulate a lost Q gospel. Farrer's case rested on the following points:&lt;ref name="dispensing"&gt;Austin M. Farrer, "On Dispensing with Q" in D. E. Nineham (ed.), ''Studies in the Gospels: Essays in Memory of R. H. Lightfoot'' (Oxford: Blackwell, 1955), pp. 55–88, reproduced at [http://NTGateway.com/Q/Farrer.htm http://NTGateway.com/Q/Farrer.htm] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090201122628/http://www.ntgateway.com/Q/farrer.htm |date=2009-02-01 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

* The Q hypothesis was formed to answer the question of where Matthew and Luke got their common material if they did not know of each other's gospels. But if Luke had read Matthew, the question that Q answers does not arise.
* We have no evidence from early Christian writings that anything like Q ever existed.
* When scholars have attempted to reconstruct Q from the common elements of Matthew and Luke, the result does not look like a gospel.
** Although many scholars originally thought of Q as a sayings gospel, a collection of teachings with no narrative content, all alleged reconstructions of Q from the common parts of Matthew and Luke include narrative about John the Baptist, Jesus' baptism and temptation in the wilderness, and his healing of a centurion's servant.
** However, they don't include an account of Jesus' death and resurrection.
** But from the earliest Christian writings, we see a strong emphasis on precisely the element that a putative Q omits, Jesus' death and resurrection.
* Some scholars have attempted to overcome problems with Q reconstructions by claiming we cannot know the actual contents of the Q gospel. However, postulating Luke's acquaintance with the gospel of Matthew overcomes these same problems and gives the source for the common material.

The most notable argument for the Farrer hypothesis is that there are many passages where the text of Matthew and Luke agree in making small changes to that of Mark (what is called the [[double tradition]]). This would follow naturally if Luke was using Matthew and Mark, but is hard to explain if he is using Mark and Q. Streeter divides these into six groups and finds separate hypotheses for each. 

Farrer comments that "[h]is argument finds its strength in the fewness of the instances for which any one hypothesis needs to be invoked; but the opposing counsel will unkindly point out that the diminution of the instances for each hypothesis is in exact proportion to the multiplication of the hypotheses themselves. One cannot say that Dr. Streeter's plea is incapable of being sustained, but one must concede that it is a plea against apparent evidence".

Goodacre puts forth an additional argument from ''fatigue'', meaning cases where a derivative passage begins to make changes to its source but fails to sustain them and lapses back into the original version. For example, the [[parable of the talents]] is more coherent in Matthew, but less so in Luke, who attempted to increase the number of servants from three to ten. The several instances where this is observed point to Luke using Matthew rather than contrariwise.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Goodacre, "Fatigue in the Synoptics", ''New Testament Studies'' 44 (1998), pp. 45-58, reproduced at [http://www.markgoodacre.org/Q/fatigue.htm http://www.markgoodacre.org/Q/fatigue.htm].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mark Goodacre, ''The Case Against Q: Studies in Markan Priority and the Synoptic Problem'' (2002), pp. 40-43.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Streeter's five arguments against===

Five arguments are given by Streeter for the impossibility of Luke relying on Matthew.

# The first is that he would not have omitted some of the Matthean texts that he did because they are so striking. Farrer replies that they were omitted because they do not conform to the 'edifice' that Luke is building.
# The second is that Luke sometimes preserves a more primitive version of a text that is also in Matthew. Farrer replies that this depends on being able to identify the more "primitive" text; for example, "Blessed are the poor in spirit" suits Matthew's theology, but it would be natural for Luke to drop the "in spirit" to fit his concern with the poor.
# The third is that Luke follows Mark's order but does not do the same with Matthew. Farrer asks, in reply, why he should: "Is it surprising that he should lay his plan on Marcan foundations, and quarry St. Matthew for materials to build up his house?".
# The fourth is that Luke uses the material less well than Matthew. Farrer replies that this may be so, but he would not be the first adapter to have produced a less skilful result, the only issue was whether it would suit Luke's message better to have the material arranged in this way.
# The final argument is that Luke does not use the material within the same Marcan paragraphs as Matthew. Farrer points out that he takes them out of a Marcan context and reproduces them elsewhere. In chapters 10-18, Luke reassembles the teaching material in a way which makes the points that he wants to make, often by pairing sayings that have not been paired together before. This may have been to produce a Christian [[Deuteronomy]], just as it was argued that Matthew's gospel was in the form of a Christian [[Pentateuch]].

[[Image:Construccionkaiserrich.jpg|thumb|right|A greyfield in [[Richmond, California]] is used to expand a [[Kaiser Permanente]] hospital.]]
'''Greyfield land''' (or '''grayfield''') is economically obsolescent, outdated, failing, moribund or underused [[real estate]] assets or land. The term was coined in the early 2000s from the 'sea' of empty asphalt that often accompanies these sites. "Greyfield" is a relative [[neologism]] as compared to more commonly known terms such as [[Brownfield land|brownfield]] or [[Greenfield land|greenfield]].

The term has historically been applied to formerly-viable retail and commercial shopping sites (such as regional malls and strip centers) that have suffered from lack of reinvestment and have been "outclassed" by larger, better-designed, better-anchored malls or shopping sites. These particular greyfield sites are also referred to as "[[dead mall]]s" or "ghostboxes" if the anchor or other major tenants have vacated the premises leaving behind empty shells.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aboutremediation.com/techdir/tech_definitions_full.asp?technameid=194 Greyfield definition]&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike brownfields, which feature actual or perceived levels of environmental contamination, greyfields typically do not require remediation in order to unlock value to an investor. The hidden value, in many cases, comes from underlying infrastructure (such as plumbing and sewerage, electrical systems, foundations, etc.) the presence of which allows a developer to improve the site efficiently through capital expenditures (sometimes quite minor) that may easily lead to increased rents and greater value. Other important potential qualities include parking, a central location, etc. may also be leveraged in a well-executed redevelopment of the site.

Some greyfields may also be considered favorable to investors because even if they are outclassed or physically in disrepair, they have revenue in place through long- or short-term leases. Greyfields with short-term leases may work well for an investor/developer who has a strategy involving intensive real estate asset management. By actively managing the greyfield in a short-term lease environment, rents may be increased after improvements are made.

The "greyfield" term may also be applied more broadly to urban infill or commercial locations where underuse or outdated (non-retail) uses hamper an otherwise valuable real estate asset. An example would be a formerly industrial waterfront site that is potentially valuable as a mixed use/residential site as it is being encroached upon by residential sprawl, or other economic or redevelopment pressures. In this example, the revitalization of the greyfield may require [[zoning]] changes and/or a public-private partnership of some kind to achieve the highest and best use.

==Background==
In 2001 the [[Congress for the New Urbanism]] coined the term "greyfield," which refers to aging strips of development that once served as vital commercial corridors during the post-[[World War II]] suburban exodus but have today fallen on harder times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gamble|first=Michael|author2=W. Jude LeBlanc|title=Incremental Urbanism: The Auto and Pedestrian Reconsidered in Greyfield Reclamation — Atlanta, Georgia|journal=Incremental Urbanism|year=2004|volume=16|issue=3|page=1|url=http://places.designobserver.com/media/pdf/Incremental_Ur_660.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to contaminated brownfields and undeveloped greenfields, greyfields refer to "so-called 'dead malls,' often characterized by the vast empty asphalt parking lots that surround them."&lt;ref name="mallsintomainstreets"&gt;{{cite web|last=CONGRESS FOR THE NEW URBANISM|title=Malls into Mainstreets. An In-Depth Guide to Transforming Dead Malls into Communities.|url=https://www.cnu.org/sites/files/mallsintomainstreets.pdf|publisher=Congress for the New Urbanism|accessdate=January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most conservative calculations in 1999 estimated that there would be no fewer than 203 American greyfield malls with a combined outstanding debt of over $2 billion and projected redevelopment costs of over $11 billion by 2004. In 2001, of the 2,000 American regional malls, it was estimated that nearly 20% were greyfield malls or in danger of becoming one.&lt;ref name="mallsintomainstreets"/&gt;

The Central City Mall in [[San Bernardino]], [[California]]; the [[Prestonwood Town Center]] in [[Dallas]], [[Texas]]; the [[Maple Hill Pavilion]] in [[Kalamazoo]], [[Michigan]] and the Lafayette Plaza in [[Bridgeport]], [[Connecticut]] are all examples of greyfields in American cities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Blackbird|first=Peter|title=Deadmalls.com|url=http://deadmalls.com/features.html#CA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics==
An average site size of {{convert|45|acre|ha}}. These sites are both smaller and less connected to the regional transportation system than those housing America's best-performing malls, which average over {{convert|70|acre|ha}} in size, with freeway visibility and direct ramp access.&lt;ref name="mallsintomainstreets"/&gt;

Located in established neighborhoods and shopping districts and on suburban arterials with bus service, many are already bus hubs.&lt;ref name="mallsintomainstreets"/&gt;

They have formidable competition; on average, greyfield malls have 2.3 million square feet ({{convert|2300000|sqft|m2|disp=output only}}) million square feet of competing retail space in 22 other centers within {{convert|5|mi}}. They are often older and smaller than the most successful malls in their region.&lt;ref name="mallsintomainstreets"/&gt;

Conventional renovations will not be sufficient to breathe new life into many properties. A facelift will do little to help. A new anchor store, depending on the center's position in the market, may not do much either.&lt;ref name="mallsintomainstreets"/&gt;

==Factors for redevelopment==
Critical factors necessary for the redevelopment of a greyfield site include the following:

*Market conditions
*Ownership and anchor tenant status;
*Site and location factors;
*Municipal and community capacity
*Developer and lender capacity&lt;ref name="mallsintomainstreets"/&gt;

==Lessons==
Lessons from successful greyfield transformations are based on the case studies of the [[Paseo Colorado]] development in [[Pasadena, California|Pasadena]], [[California]], the City Place development in [[Long Beach, California|Long Beach]], California, the Belmar development in [[Lakewood, Colorado]], the Downtown Park Forest development in [[Park Forest, Illinois]], the [[Mizner Park]] development in [[Boca Raton]], [[Florida]], and the Winter Park Village development in [[Winter Park, Florida]] conducted by the Congress for New Urbanism:&lt;ref name="mallsintomainstreets"/&gt;

*Incorporate features that will maximize environmental benefits
*Explore major physical changes
*Use car parking carefully
*Incorporate public amenities that add value and distinguish the development
*Include civic and institutional activities
*Expect a lengthy pre-development period and prepare for complications
*Establish a high standard for urban design
*Market the new concept
*Develop mixed-uses that can thrive independently
*Patient money is the best fit for town center projects&lt;ref name="mallsintomainstreets"/&gt;

==History of the University==

In March 1964, the Central South Bureau of the Central Government, and the Party Committee and the People's Government of Guangdong Province decided to set up a foreign languages institute to train  competent graduates to meet the demands of the increasing international exchanges. In November 1964, with the sanction of the Central Government, Guangzhou Foreign Languages Institute was established. In July 1965, it began to enroll 4-year bachelor's degree students and offered 4 specialties – English, German, French, and Spanish. It was located at the old site of Guangdong Petroleum School in the Northeast suburbs of Guangzhou.

Since January 1966, Guagnzhou Foreign Languages Institute had been operating under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Higher Education of the Central People's Government. In October 1969, in accordance with the CPC Central Committee's ''Notice to Transfer the Institutions of Higher Education to the Revolutionary Committees,'' the institute was delegated to Guangdong Province's Cultural Revolutionary Committee.

In October 1970, Guangdong Provincial Revolutionary Committee restructured the institutions of higher education in Guangdong Province. As a result, Sun Yat-sen University Foreign Languages Department, Jinan University Foreign Languages and Foreign Trade Department, and Guanghzou Foreign Languages School were merged into Guangzhou Foreign Languages Institute. In the meantime, the institute was renamed as Guangdong Foreign Languages Institute and was then moved to the old site of Central South Forestry Institute in the Northern Suburbs of Guangzhou.

In November 1977, the school resumed the name of Guangzhou Foreign Languages Institute and again operated directly under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Education.

In December 1980, with the approval of the State Council, Guangzhou Foreign Trade Institute was established in the northern suburbs of Guangzhou. The institute evolved from Guangdong Provincial Foreign Trade Cadres School, which was founded in 1957 and operated directly under the jurisdiction of Guangdong Provincial Foreign Trade Bureau. In 1960, on the basis of Guangdong Provincial Foreign Trade Cadres School, Guangdong Foreign Trade School was founded and began to matriculate excellent students from middle schools, who were required to fulfill five years studies. In 1961, Guangdong Provincial Foreign Trade School became attached to Guangdong Provincial Finance and Trade Cadres School. During the Cultural Revolution (1966-1976), Guangdong Provincial Foreign Trade School was suspended for a time and re-opened in 1973. In accordance with the decision by Guangdong provincial government, Guangzhou Foreign Languages Institute Foreign Trade Department was incorporated into Guangdong Provincial Foreign Trade School, which began to enroll three-year college students in 1978. Later, the newly founded Guangzhou Foreign Trade Institute offered foreign trade economy, foreign trade accounting, and other specialties, and the students enrolled were required to fulfill four years schooling. The institute operated under the joint jurisdiction of the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Guangdong provincial government, with the former playing the dominant role.

In September 1994, Guangzhou Foreign Trade Institute was delegated to the jurisdiction of the People's Government of Guangdong Province by the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation. In January 1995, Guangzhou Foreign Languages Institute was transferred to Guangdong province by the State Education Commission. In May 1995, the two institutes merged. As a result, Guagndong University of Foreign Studies came into being.

In 2003, with the approval of the People's Government of Guangdong Province, Guangdong University of Foreign Studies joined the University Town program and officially started the construction of South Campus. In September 2004, the campus came into use and received its first batch of university students.

In October 2008, according to the decision by the People's Government of Guangdong Province, Guangdong Vocational College of Finance and Economics, which was established in April 1996, had been named Guangdong College of Finance and Tax Administration from April 1996 to July 2001 and was incorporated into Guangdong University of Foreign Studies.

[[File:WWE HOUSE SHOW - LIVE EVENT LOGO.PNG|thumbnail|[[WWE]] Live Event logo since 2014]]
A '''house show''' or '''live event''' is a [[professional wrestling]] event produced by a major [[Professional wrestling promotion|promotion]] that is not televised, though they can be recorded. Promotions use house shows mainly to cash in on the exposure that they and their wrestlers receive during televised events, as well as to test reactions to matches, wrestlers, and [[Gimmick (professional wrestling)|gimmicks]] that are being considered for the main televised programming.

[[File:WWE Live - Sheamus vs. The Miz.jpg|thumb|[[Sheamus]] vs. [[The Miz]] at a WWE Live Event at the [[Genting Arena]] in [[Birmingham, England]]]]
House shows are often used to promote upcoming televised events, especially [[pay-per-view]]s, and will then feature matches between wrestlers who are scheduled to [[Work (professional wrestling)|work a match]] at the pay-per-view. This allows them to secure a 'feel' for each other's style and test out specific parts of matches planned for pay-per-view.

From the 1950s to late 1980s, most major matches and title changes happened at house shows, largely due to the costs to produce a TV show at the time, plus the lack of more modern technology making it significantly harder to tape a TV show. TV shows were taped in small studios, and featured [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Squash|squash match]]es, [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Run-in|run-ins]], and [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Promo|promos]] which revolved around feuds to be settled at the house show. Some of these big matches later aired, often scheduled "for TV time remaining", which usually ran out as the match built to a finish, hopefully making fans regret missing it and buy tickets to the next show. This changed in the 1990s as the formula for TV shows had changed completely by the time, largely due to the advent of  ''[[WWE Raw|Monday Night Raw]]''  and the then-new ''[[WCW Monday Nitro|Monday Nitro]]'' which changed the way TV shows were taped and proved to be a huge success for the WWF.  

House shows are similar to [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Dark match|dark matches]] with both being untelevised events. The only difference is that dark matches are untelevised matches in TV programs which were already being televised.

House shows are also often designed to make the [[Face (professional wrestling)|face]] wrestlers to win most matches, largely to send the crowd home happy. Though, if a [[Heel (professional wrestling)|heel]] defends a title, the face may win by disqualification if this is the case.

== Production ==
[[File:2012 WWE House Show set.jpg|thumb|The stage and ramp for a 2012 WWE Live Event]]  
Since house shows are not televised, promotions do not usually deploy the setup for staging or [[pyrotechnics]] used for their television counterparts. In the past, a [[WWE]] house show would consist mainly of a ring, essential lighting, and a crowd.&lt;ref name="bishop"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Wrestling/2012/03/11/19488101.html |title=House show upgrade helps WWE show in East Lansing |last1=Bishop |first1=Matt |website=Slam! Sports |publisher=Canoe.ca |accessdate=3 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In late 2011, WWE invested US$1.5 million in production improvements, which included three [[LED]]-lit entrance stages (one for ''[[WWE Raw|Raw]]'', one for ''[[WWE SmackDown|SmackDown]]'' and one backup)&lt;ref name="styles012012"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/inside/wwe-debuts-new-live-event-set | title=WWE debuts set for live events | last1=Styles | first1=Joey | last2=Patts | first2=James | website=WWE.com | publisher=[[WWE]]| accessdate=3 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; featuring a ramp and video display. They also began utilizing the arena's multimedia equipment to play wrestler entrance and promo videos.&lt;ref name="bishop"/&gt;

Because house shows are not televised, sometimes controversial things occur during them (although this is rare) which might not happen on a televised show. For example, on May 19, 1996, the [[The Kliq#The MSG "Curtain Call"|"MSG incident"]], which was also a rare example of a [[Shoot (professional wrestling)|shoot]], occurred at a house show taped at [[Madison Square Garden]]. At the same show, [[The Bodydonnas]] lost their [[World Tag Team Championship (WWE)|WWF Tag Team Championship]] to [[The Godwinns]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/inside/titlehistory/worldtagteam/3044541321233 |title=The Godwinns's First Reign |publisher=[[World Wrestling Entertainment]] |accessdate=2007-06-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070703205104/http://www.wwe.com/inside/titlehistory/worldtagteam/3044541321233 |archivedate=2007-07-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Title changes ==
{{too many examples|date=July 2017}}
Most major promotions try to develop their [[Angle (professional wrestling)|angles]] only during televised shows and will rarely [[Professional wrestling booker|book]] a major development (such as a title change) for house shows. If there is a title change, the title usually changes back during the same show or at another show on the loop before another televised event. These changes are usually not mentioned on television and happen more frequently during tours in areas that get shows rarely.&lt;ref name=slam&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.canoe.ca/Slam/Wrestling/2003/08/16/162182.html|title=Final chapter for Booker T?|author=TJ Madigan|publisher=SLAM! Wrestling|accessdate=2008-04-17|date=August 16, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== World Wrestling Federation/Entertainment/WWE ===

==== Unrecognized title changes ====
[[File:Jeff-Hardy-&amp;-Triple-H on Stage,-RLA-Melb-10.11.2007.jpg|right|thumb|250px|[[Jeff Hardy]] and [[Triple H]] pose amongst the [[pyrotechnics]] at a WWE ''[[Raw (WWE brand)|Raw]]'' non-televised event in [[Australia]]]]
Some notable house show title changes include an August 10, 1987 match where [[The Fabulous Rougeaus|The Rougeau Brothers]] ([[Raymond Rougeau|Raymond]] and [[Jacques Rougeau|Jacques]]) went over the champion [[Hart Foundation]] ([[Bret Hart]] and [[Jim Neidhart]]) to take the [[World Tag Team Championship (WWE)|WWF Tag Team championship]] in the Rougeau's home town of Montreal. This change (and the eventual "decision reversal") was only ever mentioned during segments taped specifically for and shown in the Montreal market. 

A similar incident occurred in 1990 when [[The Rockers]] ([[Shawn Michaels]] and [[Marty Jannetty]]) took the title from the Hart Foundation. During the match a problem with the ring ropes meant the match could not air on television as originally planned, so [[kayfabe]] President [[Jack Tunney]] "reversed the decision" in [[Bill Apter|print media]] which had reported the change before the decision not to air it was made. The match was not acknowledged on television at the time.&lt;ref name=slam/&gt;

==== WWF Championship ====
Even rarer is the top title of a promotion changing hands. This has occurred relatively few times, a notable occurrence including [[Kevin Nash|Diesel]] winning the then [[WWE Championship|WWF Championship]] from [[Bob Backlund]] in 1994 at a live event in [[Madison Square Garden]].

==== WWF/WWE Intercontinental Championship ====
On January 17, 1992, [[Jacques Rougeau|The Mountie]] beat [[Bret Hart]] in [[Springfield, Massachusetts|Springfield]], [[Massachusetts|MA]] for the [[WWE Intercontinental Championship|WWF Intercontinental Championship]]. The reason this was done is because Hart was going through contract negotiations. He lost the title two days later to [[Roddy Piper]] at the [[Royal Rumble (1992)|1992 Royal Rumble]].

[[Shawn Michaels]] won his second Intercontinental title in [[Albany, New York|Albany]], [[New York (state)|NY]] from [[Marty Jannetty]] with help from his debuting bodyguard [[Kevin Nash|Diesel]] on June 6, 1993.

On May 19, 1995, [[Scott Hall|Razor Ramon]] beat [[Jeff Jarrett]] in a [[ladder match]] at the Montreal Forum for the WWF Intercontinental Championship. Then Jarrett beat Ramon to regain the belt in a regular match two days later on May 21, in [[Trois-Rivières]], [[Quebec]]. Although neither one of these house show matches was taped, the title changes are officially recognized by WWE on its website. On the ''Monday Night Raw'' following the Sunday night match in Trois-Rivieres, [[Vince McMahon]] informed the audience about the title changes from that weekend, and they were referenced several times in the weeks that followed on WWF television whenever Jarrett appeared on TV with the championship belt.

House show title changes can occur both to test the reaction of the win or as a "special treat" for a specific audience. [[Edge (wrestler)|Edge]] was given his first Intercontinental Championship win over [[Jeff Jarrett]] in [[Toronto]]&lt;ref name=slam/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Copeland|first=Adam|authorlink=Edge (wrestler)|title=Adam Copeland On Edge|publisher=World Wrestling Entertainment Books|year=2004|page=130|isbn=978-1-4165-0523-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; to excite the fans in Edge's hometown.&lt;ref name=slam/&gt; As per usual, he dropped the belt back to Jarrett the following evening at [[Fully Loaded (1999)|Fully Loaded]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Copeland|first=Adam|authorlink=Edge (wrestler)|title=Adam Copeland On Edge|publisher=World Wrestling Entertainment Books|year=2004|page=131|isbn=978-1-4165-0523-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

On August 10, 2003 in [[Des Moines, Iowa]], [[Christian Cage|Christian]] defeated [[Booker T (wrestler)|Booker T]] to win the [[WWE Intercontinental Championship]] as Booker had suffered an injury.&lt;ref name=slam/&gt;

====WWE United States Championship====

On July 7, 2017, [[AJ Styles]] defeated [[Kevin Owens]] to win the [[WWE United States Championship]] at a house show at [[Madison Square Garden]].

==== WWE Cruiserweight Championship ====
Title changes at house shows most commonly occur when a promotion is overseas promoting their brand. For example, [[James Maritato|Nunzio]] won the [[WWE Cruiserweight Championship (1991–2007)|WWE Cruiserweight Championship]] from [[Juventud Guerrera]] in [[Rome]] on November 15, 2005.

==== WWF/WWE Women's Championship ====
At a [[France|French]] house show on April 24, 2007, [[Mickie James]] pinned [[Lisa Marie Varon|Victoria]] to win [[Melina Perez|Melina]]'s [[WWE Women's Championship (1956–2010)|WWE Women's Championship]] in a [[professional wrestling match types#basic non-elimination matches|triple threat match]]. Two matches later, Melina had a one on one rematch with James and pinned her to recapture the title after. On its website WWE recognized both title changes, making James a three time Women's Champion and Melina a two-time Women's Champion.&lt;ref name=wwetitle&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/inside/titlehistory/women/|title=History of the Women's Championship|accessdate=2007-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== WWF/World Tag Team Championship ====
[[File:SyrHouseShow.jpg|thumb|right|[[D-Generation X|DX]] wrestling [[The Spirit Squad]] at a WWE house show in [[Syracuse, New York]]]]
Examples include [[La Résistance (professional wrestling)|La Résistance]] defeating [[William Regal]] and [[Jonathan Coachman]] (Eugene's Substitute) to win the [[World Tag Team Championship (WWE)|World Tag Team Championship]] on January 16, 2005 in [[Winnipeg|Winnipeg, Manitoba]].

Two years later, at a house show in [[Cape Town]], [[South Africa]] on September 5, 2007, [[Paul London and Brian Kendrick]] defeated [[Lance Cade and Trevor Murdoch]] to win Cade and Murdoch's World Tag Team Championship, but went on to lose the titles back to Cade and Murdoch just three days later at another house show on that South African tour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wrestleview.com/news2006/1189056627.shtml|title=WWE House Show results from South Africa|accessdate=2007-09-06|publisher=WrestleView}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The World Tag Team Championship changed hands again at a house show on December 13, 2008 in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada, when [[John Morrison and The Miz]] defeated [[CM Punk]] and [[Kofi Kingston]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/inside/titlehistory/worldtagteam/20081213WorldTagChamps|title=History of the World Tag Team Championship - The Miz &amp; John Morrison|date=2008-12-13|accessdate=2009-03-12|publisher=[[World Wrestling Entertainment]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==== WWE Tag Team Championship ====
On January 15, 2012 in [[Oakland, California|Oakland]], [[California|CA]], Air Boom ([[Matt Sydal|Evan Bourne]]) &amp; Kofi Kingston (Air Boom) on the January 15th 2012 dropped the Tag Team Titles to Primo &amp; Epico (due to a suspension to Evan Bourne) at a House Show in [[Oakland]], CA

==== WWF/WWE Hardcore Championship ====
Due to its [[WWE Hardcore Championship#24/7 rule|24/7 rule]], the [[WWE Hardcore Championship|Hardcore Championship]] changed hands a total of 128 times at house shows, making up more than half of its total reigns at 240.

==== NXT Championship ====
On April 21, 2016, [[Samoa Joe]] defeated [[Finn Bálor]] for the [[NXT Championship]] at a live event in [[Lowell, Massachusetts|Lowell]], [[Massachusetts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uproxx.com/prowrestling/samoa-joe-nxt-champion/|title=A Major Championship Changed Hands At Last Night’s NXT Live Event In Massachusetts|publisher=Uproxx}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 3, 2016, [[Shinsuke Nakamura]] defeated Samoa Joe for the NXT Championship at a live event in [[Osaka]], [[Japan]].

=== World Championship Wrestling ===
[[World Championship Wrestling]]'s house shows occasionally featured title changes which were never officially recognized. Recordings of certain house shows were occasionally televised by [[TBS (TV network)|TBS]] midweek, including one in which [[Diamond Dallas Page]] used his Diamond Cutter finisher on the hosts of the network's ''[[Dinner and a Movie]]''.

==== WCW Television Championship ====
[[Booker T (wrestler)|Booker T]] and [[Chris Benoit]] traded the [[WCW World Television Championship]] back-and-forth on several house shows, with Booker (the official champion) always having the title back in time for ''[[WCW Monday Nitro|Nitro]]''.

==== WCW United States Heavyweight Championship ====
[[Terry Funk]] once defeated [[Lance Storm]] for the [[WCW United States Heavyweight Championship]] in Funk's hometown of [[Amarillo, Texas]]; this title change remained unrecognized until the World Wrestling Federation bought out WCW in 2001.

=== Total Nonstop Action Wrestling ===
[[Total Nonstop Action Wrestling]] (TNA) has also featured title changes at house shows.

==== TNA Global Championship ====
On January 27, 2010 in [[Cardiff]], [[Wales]], when [[Rob Terry]] defeated Eric Young to win the [[TNA Global Championship]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/sport/wrestling/2830549/TNAS-Big-Rob-Terry-chats-to-The-Sun-about-his-championship-win-in-Cardiff.html|title=Big Rob hails his big victory|date=2010-01-29|last=McNichol|first=Rob|accessdate=2010-01-31|work=[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== TNA X Division Championship ====
In September 2010 the [[TNA X Division Championship]] changed hands twice at house shows, when first [[Amazing Red]] defeated [[Jay Lethal]] at a house show in his hometown of [[New York City]] on September 23 to win the title and two days later Lethal regained it in [[Rahway, New Jersey]], near his hometown of [[Elizabeth, New Jersey]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wrestleview.com/viewnews.php?id=1285289825 |title=TNA title changes hands at show in New York City |date=2010-09-23 |accessdate=2010-09-26 |last=Martin |first=Adam |work=WrestleView |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101007184646/http://www.wrestleview.com/viewnews.php?id=1285289825 |archivedate=2010-10-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wrestleview.com/viewnews.php?id=1285461519 |title=TNA title changes hands once again in New Jersey |date=2010-09-25 |accessdate=2010-09-26 |last=Martin |first=Adam |work=WrestleView |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100930203205/http://www.wrestleview.com/viewnews.php?id=1285461519 |archivedate=2010-09-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Imperial overstretch''', also known as '''Imperial overreach''', is a [[hypothesis]] which suggests that an [[empire]] can extend itself beyond its ability to maintain or expand its [[military]] and [[economic]] commitments. Arguably, this was true of the [[Roman Empire]], which was strong and effective in the first and early second centuries CE, despite a few setbacks (Germany in 9CE; Scotland in the 80s CE) but lost territories (e.g. [[Dacia]] and [[Mesopotamia]]) after that and could not keep the Saxons, Huns and other 'barbarians' out in the 4th and 5th centuries.   

Clearly, this was true of the Napoleonic Empire, which made rapid gains by conquest in the first decade after [[Napoleon]] became dictator of [[France]], but became over-extended militarily when it attempted to conquer Russia in 1812. Likewise the [[Germany|German]] reich in 1942.

The idea was popularised by [[Yale University]] historian [[Paul Kennedy]] in his 1987 book ''[[The Rise and Fall of the Great Powers]]''.

{{cquote|
Might Washington, like Rome, fall victim to imperial overstretch? Could military force abroad eventually have to be withdrawn because of bankruptcy at home? Might the whole idea of America eventually be challenged and destroyed by some charismatic new faith: some fundamentalist variant on Christianity? Or will nature disrupt America's new world order?

[[File:Jabberwocky.jpg|right|thumb|The Jabberwock, as illustrated by [[John Tenniel]]]]
"'''Jabberwocky'''" is a [[nonsense verse|nonsense poem]] written by [[Lewis Carroll]] about the killing of a creature named "the Jabberwock". It was included in his 1871 novel ''[[Through the Looking-Glass|Through the Looking-Glass, and What Alice Found There]]'', the sequel to ''[[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland]]''. The book tells of Alice's adventures within the [[Parallel universe (fiction)|back-to-front world]] of [[Looking-Glass Land]].

In an early scene in which she first encounters the chess piece characters [[White King (Through the Looking-Glass)|White King]] and [[White Queen (Through the Looking-Glass)|White Queen]], Alice finds a book written in a seemingly unintelligible language. Realizing that she is travelling through an inverted world, she recognises that the verses on the pages are written in [[mirror-writing]]. She holds a mirror to one of the poems and reads the reflected verse of "Jabberwocky". She finds the nonsense verse as puzzling as the odd land she has passed into, later revealed as a dreamscape.&lt;ref name="AAW64"/&gt;

"Jabberwocky" is considered one of the greatest nonsense poems written in English.&lt;ref name=" Gardner"&gt;{{cite book |last=Gardner |first=Martin |title=The Annotated Alice: The Definitive Edition|year=1999 |publisher=W.

==Origin and publication==
[[File:Aliceroom2.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Alice climbing into the [[Looking-Glass Land]]. Illustration by [[John Tenniel]], 1871]]
A decade before the publication of ''[[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland]]'' and the sequel ''[[Through the Looking-Glass]]'', Carroll wrote the first stanza to what would become "Jabberwocky" while in [[Croft on Tees]], close to [[Darlington]], where he lived as a child. &lt;!-- we need to check this source b/c he lived in Daresbury - unless they moved to Darlington which is confusing. --&gt; It was printed in 1855 in ''[[Mischmasch]]'', a periodical he wrote and illustrated for the amusement of his family. The piece was titled "Stanza of Anglo-Saxon Poetry" and read:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
Twas bryllyg, and ''y&lt;sup&gt;e&lt;/sup&gt;'' slythy toves
Did gyre and gymble in ''y&lt;sup&gt;e&lt;/sup&gt;'' wabe:
All mimsy were ''y&lt;sup&gt;e&lt;/sup&gt;'' borogoves;
And ''y&lt;sup&gt;e&lt;/sup&gt;'' mome raths outgrabe.
&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Carroll wrote the letter-combination ''y&lt;sup&gt;e&lt;/sup&gt;'' throughout the poem instead of the word ''the'', using the letter Y in place of the letter [[thorn (letter)|þ (Thorn)]] in combination with the superscript E, as in ''þ&lt;sup&gt;e&lt;/sup&gt;'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bl.uk/collection-items/lewis-carroll-juvenilia-stanza-of-anglo-saxon-poetry |title=Lewis Carroll juvenilia: 'Stanza of Anglo-Saxon Poetry' - The British Library |publisher=Bl.uk |date=2014-04-16 |accessdate=2016-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; a common abbreviation for the word [[Thorn (letter)#Middle and Early Modern English|''the'']] in middle and early modern English, presumably to create a pseudo-archaic impression.

The rest of the poem was written during Carroll's stay with relatives at [[Whitburn, South Tyneside|Whitburn]], near [[Sunderland, Tyne and Wear|Sunderland]]. The story may have been partly inspired by the local Sunderland area legend of the [[Lambton Worm]],&lt;ref&gt;''A Town Like Alice's'' (1997) Michael Bute Heritage Publications, Sunderland&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Alice in Sunderland'' (2007) Brian Talbot Dark Horse publications.&lt;/ref&gt; and the tale of the [[Sockburn Worm]] while writing in [[Croft on Tees]] and [[Whitburn, South Tyneside|Whitburn]] in [[Sockburn]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.englandsnortheast.co.uk/CroftLewisCarroll.html|title=Vikings and the Jabberwock: Croft, Sockburn and Sadberge|accessdate=7 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of nonsense verse was not original to Carroll, who would have known of [[chapbooks]] such as ''[[The World Turned Upside Down]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://publicdomainreview.org/collections/the-world-turned-upside-down-18th-century/ |title=The World Turned Upside Down (18th century) |publisher=The Public Domain Review |date= |accessdate=2016-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; and stories such as "[[Samuel Foote|The Great Panjundrum]]". Nonsense existed in [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]'s work and was well-known in the [[Brothers Grimm]]'s fairytales, some of which are called lying tales or ''lügenmärchen''.&lt;ref&gt;Carpenter (1985), 55–56&lt;/ref&gt; [[Roger Lancelyn Green]] suggests that "Jabberwocky" is a parody of the old German ballad "[[The Shepherd of the Giant Mountains]]" in which a shepherd kills a [[griffin]] that is attacking his sheep.&lt;ref Name="Lucas"&gt;"Jabberwocky back to Old English: Nonsense, Anglo-Saxon and Oxford" by Lucas, Peter J. in ''Language History and Linguistic Modelling'' (1997)  p503-520 {{ISBN|978-3-11-014504-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref Name="Hudson"&gt;Hudson, Derek (1977) ''Lewis Carroll: an illustrated biography''.

New York: Norton p 154, n. 42.&lt;/ref&gt; Historian Sean B. Palmer suggests that Carroll was inspired by a section from Shakespeare's ''Hamlet'', citing the lines: "The graves stood tenantless, and the sheeted dead/Did squeak and gibber in the Roman streets" from Act&amp;nbsp;I, Scene&amp;nbsp;i.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://inamidst.com/notes/hamwocky |title="Hamlet and Jabberwocky" ''Essays by Sean Palmer'' 21 Aug 2005 |publisher=Inamidst.com |date=2005-08-21 |accessdate=2018-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Carroll makes later reference to the same lines from ''Hamlet'' Act I, Scene i in the 1869 poem "Phantasmagoria". He wrote: "Shakspeare  {{sic}} I think it is who treats/Of Ghosts, in days of old,/Who 'gibbered in the Roman streets".&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!-- He altered the spelling for ''Through the Looking Glass''.&lt;ref Name="Hudson"/&gt;  --&gt;

[[John Tenniel]] reluctantly agreed to illustrate the book in 1871,&lt;ref Name="Prickett"/&gt; and his illustrations are still the defining images of the poem. The illustration of the Jabberwock may reflect the contemporary Victorian obsession with natural history and the fast-evolving sciences of [[palaeontology]] and geology. Stephen Prickett notes that in the context of [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]] and [[Gideon Mantell|Mantell's]] publications and vast exhibitions of dinosaurs, [[Crystal Palace Dinosaurs|such as those at the Crystal Palace]] from 1854, it is unsurprising that Tenniel gave the Jabberwock "the leathery wings of a [[Pterosaur|pterodactyl]] and the long scaly neck and tail of a [[sauropod]]."&lt;ref Name="Prickett"&gt;Prickett, Stephen (2005) ''Victorian Fantasy'' Baylor University Press p80 {{ISBN|1-932792-30-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"'''Jabberwocky'''"

’Twas brillig, and the slithy toves
Did gyre and gimble in the wabe;
All mimsy were the borogoves,
And the mome raths outgrabe.

“Beware the Jabberwock, my son!
The jaws that bite, the claws that catch!
Beware the Jubjub bird, and shun
The frumious Bandersnatch!”

He took his vorpal sword in hand:
Long time the manxome foe he sought—
So rested he by the Tumtum tree,
And stood awhile in thought.

And as in uffish thought he stood,
The Jabberwock, with eyes of flame,
Came whiffling through the tulgey wood,
And burbled as it came!

One, two! One, two! And through and through
The vorpal blade went snicker-snack!
He left it dead, and with its head
He went galumphing back.

“And hast thou slain the Jabberwock?
Come to my arms, my beamish boy!
O frabjous day! Callooh! Callay!”
He chortled in his joy.

’Twas brillig, and the slithy toves
Did gyre and gimble in the wabe;
All mimsy were the borogoves,
And the mome raths outgrabe.
&lt;/poem&gt;

Many of the words in the poem are playful [[nonce word]]s of Carroll's own invention, without intended explicit meaning. When [[Alice (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|Alice]] has finished reading the poem she gives her impressions:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"It seems very pretty," she said when she had finished it, "but it's rather hard to understand!" (You see she didn't like to confess, even to herself, that she couldn't make it out at all.) "Somehow it seems to fill my head with ideas—only I don't exactly know what they are! However, somebody killed something: that's clear, at any rate."&lt;ref name="AAW64"&gt;Carroll, Lewis (2010) ''Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking-Glass''  pp 64–65 Createspace ltd {{ISBN|1-4505-7761-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This may reflect Carroll's intention for his readership; the poem is, after all, part of a dream. In later writings he discussed some of his lexicon, commenting that he did not know the specific meanings or sources of some of the words; the linguistic ambiguity and uncertainty throughout both the book and the poem may largely be the point.&lt;ref name="Parsons"/&gt;

In ''Through the Looking-Glass'', the character of [[Humpty Dumpty#In Through the Looking-Glass|Humpty Dumpty]], in response to Alice's request, explains to her the non-sense words from the first stanza of the poem; however, Carroll's personal commentary on several of the words differ from Humpty's. For example, following the poem, a "rath" is described by Humpty as "a sort of green pig".&lt;ref name="AAW96"/&gt; Carroll's notes for the original in ''[[Mischmasch]]'' suggest a "rath" is "a species of Badger" that "lived chiefly on cheese" and had smooth white hair, long hind legs, and short horns like a stag.&lt;ref name="Penguin"/&gt; The appendices to certain ''Looking Glass'' editions, however, state that the creature is "a species of land turtle" that lived on swallows and oysters.&lt;ref name="Penguin"/&gt; Later critics added their own interpretations of the lexicon, often without reference to Carroll's own contextual commentary. An extended analysis of the poem and Carroll's commentary is given in the book ''[[The Annotated Alice]]'' by [[Martin Gardner]].

In 1868 Carroll asked his publishers, [[Macmillan Publishers|Macmillan]], "Have you any means, or can you find any, for printing a page or two in the next volume of Alice in reverse?" It may be that Carroll was wanting to print the whole poem in mirror writing. Macmillan responded that it would cost a great deal more to do, and this may have dissuaded him.&lt;ref name="Penguin"/&gt;

In the author's note to the Christmas 1896 edition of ''Through the Looking-Glass'' Carroll writes, "The new words, in the poem Jabberwocky, have given rise to some differences of opinion as to their pronunciation, so it may be well to give instructions on ''that'' point also. Pronounce 'slithy' as if it were the two words, 'sly, thee': make the 'g' ''hard'' in 'gyre' and 'gimble': and pronounce 'rath' to rhyme with 'bath.'"&lt;ref&gt;Carroll, Lewis (2005) ''Through the Looking Glass''. Hayes Barton Press p. 4&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Preface to ''[[The Hunting of the Snark]]'', Carroll wrote, "[Let] me take this opportunity of answering a question that has often been asked me, how to pronounce "slithy toves." The "i" in "slithy" is long, as in "writhe", and "toves" is pronounced so as to rhyme with "groves." Again, the first "o" in "borogoves" is pronounced like the "o" in "borrow." I have heard people try to give it the sound of the "o" in "worry." Such is Human Perversity."&lt;ref name="HoS"/&gt;

==Possible interpretations of words{{anchor|Glossary}}==
* [[Bandersnatch]]: A swift moving creature with snapping jaws, capable of extending its neck.&lt;ref name="HoS"&gt;{{cite book|author=Lewis Carroll|title=The Annotated Hunting of the Snark|others=edited with notes by [[Martin Gardner]], illustrations by Henry Holiday and others, introduction by [[Adam Gopnik]]|isbn=0-393-06242-2|publisher=W. W. Norton|edition="Definitive Edition"|year=2006|origyear=1876}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 'bander' was also an archaic word for a 'leader', suggesting that a 'bandersnatch' might be an animal that hunts the leader of a group.&lt;ref name="Penguin"/&gt;
* [[wikt:beamish|Beamish]]: Radiantly beaming, happy, cheerful. Although Carroll may have believed he had coined this word, usage in 1530 is cited in the [[Oxford English Dictionary]].&lt;ref name="ExplanatoryN"&gt;Carroll, Lewis (2009) ''Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking-Glass'' "Explanatory notes"; Editor: Hunt, Peter. OUP Oxford. p. 283. {{ISBN|0-19-955829-9}} References the [[Oxford English Dictionary]] (1530).&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[wikt:borogove|Borogove]]: Following the poem Humpty Dumpty says: " 'borogove' is a thin shabby-looking bird with its feathers sticking out all round, something like a live mop." In explanatory book notes Carroll describes it further as "an extinct kind of Parrot. They had no wings, beaks turned up, made their nests under sun-dials and lived on veal."&lt;ref name="Penguin"/&gt; In ''Hunting of the Snark'', Carroll says that the initial syllable of ''borogove'' is pronounced as in ''borrow'' rather than as in ''worry''.&lt;ref name="HoS"/&gt;
* [[wikt:brillig|Brillig]]: Following the poem, the character of Humpty Dumpty comments: " 'Brillig' means four o'clock in the afternoon, the time when you begin broiling things for dinner."&lt;ref name="AAW96"/&gt;  According to ''[[Mischmasch]]'', it is derived from the verb to ''bryl'' or ''broil''.
* [[wikt:burble|Burbled]]: In a letter of December 1877, Carroll notes that "burble" could be a mixture of the three verbs 'bleat', 'murmur', and 'warble', although he did not remember creating it.&lt;ref name="ExplanatoryN"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Lewis Carroll, Letter to Maud Standen, December 1877&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[wikt:chortle|Chortled]]: "Combination of 'chuckle' and 'snort'." ([[OED]])
* [[wikt:frabjous|Frabjous]]: Possibly a blend of ''fair'', ''fabulous'', and ''joyous''. Definition from [[Oxford English Dictionary]], credited to Lewis Carroll.
* Frumious: Combination of "fuming" and "furious". In the Preface to ''The Hunting of the Snark'' Carroll comments, "[T]ake the two words 'fuming' and 'furious'. Make up your mind that you will say both words, but leave it unsettled which you will say first. Now open your mouth and speak. If your thoughts incline ever so little towards 'fuming', you will say 'fuming-furious'; if they turn, by even a hair's breadth, towards 'furious', you will say 'furious-fuming'; but if you have the rarest of gifts, a perfectly balanced mind, you will say 'frumious'."&lt;ref name="HoS"/&gt;
* [[wikt:galumphing|Galumphing]]: Perhaps used in the poem as a blend of 'gallop' and 'triumphant'.&lt;ref name="ExplanatoryN"/&gt; Used later by [[Rudyard Kipling|Kipling]], and cited by Webster as "To move with a clumsy and heavy tread"&lt;ref&gt;''The Merriam-Webster new book of word histories'' (1991) Merriam Webster p247 {{ISBN|0-87779-603-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Ekrgc3RowTgC&amp;pg=PA269&amp;lpg=PA269&amp;dq=galumphing+kipling&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=4pdjLqcQ2_&amp;sig=Q-O73oBZY77LOliQ6a42YcpXljw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=s0ehT7KLAcWP4gSdlqjZCA&amp;ved=0CHUQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=galumphing%20kipling&amp;f=false ''Alice's Adventures in Wonderland; And, Through the Looking-glass and what Alice Found There]'' (1998) Lewis Carroll, Roger Lancelyn Green, John Tenniel Oxford University Press p269 {{ISBN|978-0-19-283374-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Gimble]]: Humpty comments that it means: "to make holes like a [[Gimlet (tool)|gimlet]]."&lt;ref name="AAW96"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=HAAn1XKaOJoC&amp;pg=PA199&amp;dq=%22To+make+holes+like+a+gimlet%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Re2MUeiVPKGc0QXU3IG4Aw&amp;ved=0CFoQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22To%20make%20holes%20like%20a%20gimlet%22&amp;f=false Carroll, Lewis] (1998) ''Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking-Glass''  pp 198–199 Wordsworth Editions {{ISBN|1-85326-897-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[wikt:gyre|Gyre]]: "To 'gyre' is to go round and round like a gyroscope."&lt;ref name="AAW96"/&gt; ''Gyre'' is entered in the [[OED]] from 1420, meaning a circular or spiral motion or form; especially a giant circular oceanic surface current. However, Carroll also wrote in ''[[Mischmasch]]'' that it meant to scratch like a dog.&lt;ref name="Penguin"/&gt; The ''g'' is pronounced like the /g/ in ''gold'', not like ''gem'' (since this was how "gyroscope" was pronounced in Carroll's day).&lt;ref name="tlgp"&gt;From the preface to ''[[Through the Looking-Glass]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Jabberwock: When a class in the [[Girls' Latin School]] in Boston asked Carroll's permission to name their school magazine ''The Jabberwock'', he replied: "The [[Anglo-Saxon]] word 'wocer' or 'wocor' signifies 'offspring' or 'fruit'. Taking 'jabber' in its ordinary acceptation of 'excited and voluble discussion', this would give the meaning of 'the result of much excited and voluble discussion'..."&lt;ref name="Penguin"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=zfymo8bZhEIC&amp;pg=PA328&amp;dq=%22+the+next+volume+of+Alice+in+reverse%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=whynUb3ZK6Gc0wWehoCoAg&amp;ved=0CDcQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22%20the%20next%20volume%20of%20Alice%20in%20reverse%22&amp;f=false Carroll, Lewis (Author), Tenniel, John] (2003). ''Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass'', pp. 328–331. Penguin Classics. {{ISBN|0-14-143976-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is often depicted as a monster similar to a [[dragon]]. In the above old image it has four legs and also bat-like wings. In [[Alice in Wonderland (2010 film)|''Alice in Wonderland'' (2010 film)]] it is shown with large back legs, small dinosaur-like front legs, and on the ground it uses its wings as front legs like a [[pterosaur]], and it breathes out lightning flashes rather than flame.
* [[Jubjub bird]]: 'A desperate bird that lives in perpetual passion', according to the Butcher in Carroll's later poem ''[[The Hunting of the Snark]]''.&lt;ref name="HoS"/&gt; 'Jub' is an ancient word for a [[Jerkin (garment)|jerkin]] or a dialect word for the trot of a horse (OED). It might make reference to the call of the bird resembling the sound "jub, jub".&lt;ref name="Penguin"/&gt;
* Manxome: Possibly 'fearsome'; Possibly a portmanteau of "manly" and "buxom", the latter relating to men for most of its history; or "three-legged" after the [[Triskelion]] emblem of the [[Manx people]] from the [[Isle of Man]].
* [[wikt:mimsy|Mimsy]]: Humpty comments that " 'Mimsy' is 'flimsy and miserable' ".&lt;ref name="AAW96"/&gt;
* Mome: Humpty Dumpty is uncertain about this one: "I think it's short for 'from home', meaning that they'd lost their way, you know".  The notes in ''[[Mischmasch]]'' give a different definition of 'grave' (via 'solemome', 'solemone' and 'solemn').
* Outgrabe: Humpty says " 'outgribing' is something between bellowing and whistling, with a kind of sneeze in the middle".&lt;ref name="AAW96"/&gt; Carroll's book appendices suggest it is the past tense of the verb to 'outgribe', connected with the old verb to 'grike' or 'shrike', which derived 'shriek' and 'creak' and hence 'squeak'.&lt;ref name="Penguin"/&gt;
* Rath: Humpty Dumpty says following the poem: "A 'rath' is a sort of green pig".  Carroll's notes for the original in  ''[[Mischmasch]]'' state that a 'Rath' is "a species of land turtle. Head erect, mouth like a shark, the front forelegs curved out so that the animal walked on its knees, smooth green body, lived on swallows and oysters."&lt;ref name="Penguin"/&gt; In the [[Alice in Wonderland (1951 film)|1951 animated film adaptation of the previous book]], the raths are depicted as small, multi-coloured creatures with tufty hair, round eyes, and long legs resembling pipe stems.
* [[wikt:slithy|Slithy]]: Humpty Dumpty says: " 'Slithy' means 'lithe and slimy'.  'Lithe' is the same as 'active'. You see it's like a portmanteau, there are two meanings packed up into one word."&lt;ref name="AAW96"/&gt;  The original in ''Mischmasch'' notes that 'slithy' means "smooth and active"&lt;ref name="Penguin"/&gt; The ''i'' is long, as in ''writhe''.
* [[wikt:snicker-snack|Snicker-snack]]: possibly related to the large knife, the [[wikt:snickersnee|snickersnee]].&lt;ref name="ExplanatoryN"/&gt;
* Tove: Humpty Dumpty says " 'Toves' are something like badgers, they're something like lizards, and they're something like corkscrews. [...] Also they make their nests under sun-dials, also they live on cheese."&lt;ref name="AAW96"/&gt; Pronounced so as to rhyme with ''groves''.&lt;ref name="HoS"/&gt; They "gyre and gimble," i.e., rotate and bore.  Toves are described slightly differently in ''[[Mischmasch]]'': "a species of Badger [which] had smooth white hair, long hind legs, and short horns like a stag [and] lived chiefly on cheese".&lt;ref name="Penguin"/&gt;
* [[wikt:tulgey|Tulgey]]: Carroll himself said he could give no source for Tulgey. Could be taken to mean thick, dense, dark. It has been suggested that it comes from the [[Anglo-Cornish]] word "Tulgu", 'darkness', which in turn comes from the [[Cornish language]] "Tewolgow" 'darkness, gloominess'.&lt;ref&gt;George, Ken. An Gerlyver Meur, Cornish-English, English-Cornish Dictionary. Cornish Language Board, 2009. Part One, Cornish-English, p. 624.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Uffish: Carroll noted  "It seemed to suggest a state of mind when the voice is gruffish, the manner roughish, and the temper huffish".&lt;ref name="ExplanatoryN"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;
* [[Vorpal sword|Vorpal]]: Carroll said he could not explain this word, though it has been noted that it can be formed by taking letters alternately from "verbal" and "gospel".&lt;ref name=AnnotatedAlice&gt;{{cite book|last=Gardner|first=Martin, ed.|title=[[The Annotated Alice]]|year=1971|publisher=The World Publishing Company|location=New York|pages=195–196|origyear=1960}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Wabe: The characters in the poem suggest it means "The grass plot around a sundial", called a 'wa-be' because it "goes a long way before it, and a long way behind it".&lt;ref name="AAW96"/&gt; In the original ''Mischmasch'' text, Carroll states a 'wabe' is "the side of a hill (from its being soaked by rain)".&lt;ref name="Penguin"/&gt;

==Linguistics and poetics==
[[File:Humpty Dumpty Tenniel.jpg|thumb|right|[[Humpty Dumpty#In Through the Looking-Glass|Humpty Dumpty]] who explains to Alice the definitions of some of the words in "Jabberwocky". Illustration by [[John Tenniel]], 1871]]
Though the poem contains many nonsensical words, English [[syntax]] and poetic forms are observed, such as the [[quatrain]] verses, the general [[Rhyme scheme|ABAB rhyme scheme]] and the [[Iamb (foot)|iambic]] [[Meter (poetry)|meter]].&lt;ref&gt;Gross and McDowell (1996). ''Sound and form in modern poetry'', p. 15. The University of Michigan Press. {{ISBN|0-472-06517-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Linguist Peter Lucas believes the "nonsense" term is inaccurate. The poem relies on a distortion of sense rather than "non-sense", allowing the reader to infer meaning and therefore engage with narrative while lexical allusions swim under the surface of the poem.&lt;ref Name="Lucas"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For a full linguistic and phonetic analysis of the poem see the article "Jabberwocky back to Old English: Nonsense, Anglo-Saxon and Oxford" by Lucas, Peter J. in ''Language History and Linguistic Modelling'', pp. 503–520. 1997. {{ISBN|3-11-014504-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Marnie Parsons describes the work as a "[[semiotic]] catastrophe", arguing that the words create a discernible narrative within the structure of the poem, though the reader cannot know what they symbolise. She argues that Humpty tries, after the recitation, to "ground" the unruly multiplicities of meaning with definitions, but cannot succeed as both the book and the poem are playgrounds for the "carnivalised aspect of language". Parsons suggests that this is mirrored in the [[Prosody (linguistics)|prosody]] of the poem: in the tussle between the [[tetrameter]] in the first three lines of each stanza and [[trimeter]] in the last lines, such that one undercuts the other and we are left off balance, like the poem's hero.&lt;ref name="Parsons"/&gt;

Carroll wrote many poem parodies such as "[[Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Bat|Twinkle, twinkle little bat]]", "[[You Are Old, Father William]]" and "[[How Doth the Little Crocodile]]?" Some have become generally better known than the originals on which they are based, and this is certainly the case with "Jabberwocky".&lt;ref Name="Lucas"/&gt; The poems' successes do not rely on any recognition or association of the poems that they parody. Lucas suggests that the original poems provide a strong container but Carroll's works are famous precisely because of their random, surreal quality.&lt;ref Name="Lucas"/&gt; Carroll's grave playfulness has been compared with that of the poet [[Edward Lear]]; there are also parallels with the work of [[Gerard Manley Hopkins]] in the frequent use of soundplay, [[alliteration]], created-language and [[portmanteau]]. Both writers were Carroll's contemporaries.&lt;ref name="Parsons"&gt;Parsons, Marnie (1994)  ''Touch monkeys: nonsense strategies for reading twentieth-century poetry'', pp. 67–73.

===History===
"Jabberwocky" has been translated into numerous languages,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Lim, Keith |url=http://www76.pair.com/keithlim/jabberwocky/translations/ |title=Jabberwocky Variations: Translations|work=76.pair.com|accessdate=21 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; as the novel has been translated into 65 languages.&lt;ref&gt;Lindseth, Jon A. – Tannenbaum, Alan (eds.): ''Alice in a World of Wonderlands: The Translations of Lewis Carroll’s Masterpiece'', vol. I, p. 747. New Castle: Oak Knoll Press, 2015. {{ISBN|978-1-58456-331-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The translation might be difficult because the poem holds to English syntax and many of the principal words of the poem are invented. Translators have generally dealt with them by creating equivalent words of their own. Often these are similar in spelling or sound to Carroll's while respecting the [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]] of the language they are being translated into. In Frank L. Warrin's French translation, "'Twas brillig" becomes "Il brilgue". In instances like this, both the original and the invented words echo actual words of Carroll's [[lexicon]], but not necessarily ones with similar meanings. Translators have invented words which draw on root words with meanings similar to the English roots used by Carroll. [[Douglas Hofstadter]] noted in his essay "Translations of Jabberwocky", the word 'slithy', for example, echoes the English 'slimy', 'slither', 'slippery', 'lithe' and 'sly'. A French translation that uses 'lubricilleux' for 'slithy', evokes French words like 'lubrifier' (to lubricate) to give an impression of a meaning similar to that of Carroll's word. In his exploration of the translation challenge, Hofstadter asks "what if a word does exist, but it is very intellectual-sounding and Latinate ('lubricilleux'), rather than earthy and Anglo-Saxon ('slithy')? Perhaps 'huilasse' would be better than 'lubricilleux'? Or does the Latin origin of the word 'lubricilleux' not make itself felt to a speaker of French in the way that it would if it were an English word ('lubricilious', perhaps)? ".&lt;ref name="Hofstadter"/&gt;

Hofstadter also notes that it makes a great difference whether the poem is translated in isolation or as part of a translation of the novel. In the latter case the translator must, through Humpty Dumpty, supply explanations of the invented words. But, he suggests, "even in this pathologically difficult case of translation, there seems to be some rough equivalence obtainable, a kind of rough [[Isomorphism (sociology)|isomorphism]], partly global, partly local, between the brains of all the readers".&lt;ref name="Hofstadter"&gt;{{cite book | first = Douglas R. | last = Hofstadter | year = 1980 | title = Gödel, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid | chapter = Translations of Jabberwocky | chapterurl = http://www76.pair.com/keithlim/jabberwocky/poem/hofstadter.html| isbn = 0-394-74502-7 | publisher = Vintage Books | location = New York, NY}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1967, D.G. Orlovskaya wrote a popular Russian translation of  "Jabberwocky" entitled "Barmaglot" ("Бармаглот"). She translated "Barmaglot" for "Jabberwock", "Brandashmyg" for "Bandersnatch" while "myumsiki" ("мюмзики") echoes "mimsy". Full translations of "Jabberwocky" into French and German can be found in ''[[The Annotated Alice]]'' along with a discussion of why some translation decisions were made.&lt;ref&gt;M.

==Reception==

According to Chesterton and Green and others, the original purpose of "Jabberwocky" was to satirise both pretentious verse and ignorant literary critics. It was designed as verse showing how not to write verse, but eventually became the subject of pedestrian translation or explanation and incorporated into classroom learning.&lt;ref&gt;Green, Roger Lancelyn (1970) ''The Lewis Carroll Handbook'', "Jabberwocky, and other parodies" : Dawson of Pall Mall, London&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been interpreted as a parody of contemporary Oxford scholarship and specifically the story of how [[Benjamin Jowett]], the notoriously agnostic Professor of Greek at Oxford, and Master of [[Balliol College, Oxford|Balliol]], came to sign the ''[[Thirty-Nine Articles]]'', as an Anglican statement of faith, to save his job.&lt;ref&gt;Prickett, Stephen (2005) ''Victorian Fantasy'' Baylor University Press p113 {{ISBN|1-932792-30-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The transformation of audience perception from satire to seriousness was in a large part predicted by [[G. K. Chesterton]], who wrote in 1932, "Poor, poor, little Alice! She has not only been caught and made to do lessons; she has been forced to inflict lessons on others."&lt;ref&gt;[[G. K. Chesterton|Chesterton, G. K]] (1953) "Lewis Carroll" in ''A Handful of Authors'', ed. Dorothy Collins, Sheed and Ward, London&lt;/ref&gt;

It is often now cited as one of the greatest nonsense poems written in the English language,&lt;ref name="Gardner" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NCTE" /&gt; the source for countless parodies and tributes. In most cases the writers have changed the nonsense words into words relating to the parodied subject, as in [[Frank Jacobs]]'s "If Lewis Carroll Were a Hollywood Press Agent in the Thirties" in ''Mad for Better or Verse''.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, Frank (1968) ''Mad, for better or verse'' N.A.L&lt;/ref&gt; Other writers use the poem as a form, much like a [[sonnet]], and create their own words for it as in "Strunklemiss" by [[S. K. Azoulay]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smylesandfish.com/lounge/the-canon.php?strunklemiss=1|title=Strunklemiss|work=smylesandfish.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the poem "Oh Freddled Gruntbuggly" recited by [[Prostetnic Vogon Jeltz]] in [[Douglas Adams]]' ''[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy]]'', a book which contains numerous other references and homages to Carroll's work.&lt;ref name="Cyberspace"&gt;{{cite web|author=Robert McFarlane |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2001/aug/12/sciencefictionfantasyandhorror.douglasadams |title="Lewis Carroll in cyberspace" ''Guardian'' 12 August 2001 |publisher=Theguardian.com |date= |accessdate=2018-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
Oh freddled gruntbuggly thy micturations are to me
As plurdled gabbleblotchits on a lurgid bee.
Groop I implore thee my foonting turlingdromes
And hooptiously drangle me with crinkly bindlewurdles,
Or I will rend thee in the gobberwarts with my
blurglecruncheon, see if I don't!&lt;ref Name="Cyberspace"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Oh Freddled Gruntbuggly" by [[Prostetnic Vogon Jeltz]]. In Adams, Douglas (1988) Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Pocket Books p65 {{ISBN|0-671-74606-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Some of the words that Carroll created, such as "[[wikt:chortle|chortled]]" and "[[wikt:galumphing|galumphing]]", have entered the English language and are listed in the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]''. The word "[[wikt:Jabberwocky|jabberwocky]]" itself has come to refer to nonsense language.

In American Sign Language, Eric Malzkuhn invented the sign for "chortled" and it subsequently, and unintentionally, caught on and became a part of American Sign Language's lexicon as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sorensonvrs.com/ericm|title=Eric Malzkuhn – March 2016 -  Sorenson VRS|website=www.sorensonvrs.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Music and film==
A song called "Beware the Jabberwock" was written for Disney's ''[[Alice in Wonderland (1951 film)|Alice in Wonderland]]'' (1951). The British group [[Boeing Duveen and The Beautiful Soup]] released a single (1968) called ''Jabberwock'' based on the poem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/artist/927610-Boeing-Duveen-And-The-Beautiful-Soup|title=Boeing Duveen And The Beautiful Soup|work=Discogs}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The poem was a source of inspiration for [[Jan Švankmajer|Jan Švankmajer's]] 1971 short film ''[[Jabberwocky (1971 film)|Jabberwocky]]'', and [[Terry Gilliam|Terry Gilliam's]] 1977 [[Jabberwocky (film)|film]] of the same name. In 1972, the American composer [[Sam Pottle]] put the poem to music. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sheetmusicplus.com/title/jabberwocky-sheet-music/7445134|title=Jabberwocky Sam Pottle|work=sheetmusicplus.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The stage musical [[Jabberwocky (musical)|''Jabberwocky'']] (1973) by Andrew Kay, Malcolm Middleton and Peter Phillips, follows the basic plot of the poem.&lt;ref name="nla"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://catalogue.nla.gov.au/Record/211352|title=Catalogue entry|author=National Library of Australia|location=Canberra, ACT|accessdate=5 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.musicaustralia.org/apps/MA?function=showDetail&amp;currentBibRecord=000013683564&amp;itemSeq=6&amp;total=13&amp;returnFunction=searchResults&amp;term1=Pantomimes+with+music+Vocal+scores+with+piano.+&amp;location1=Anywhere&amp;scope=scope&amp;parameter1=phrase&amp;boolean1=and&amp;sessionId=reuseSearchF43B22291FDD847390BDEBE11A12AA641303213378404|title=Catalogue entry|author=Music Australia|location=Sydney, NSW|accessdate=5 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Jabberwock is a central character in [[Tim Burton]]'s ''[[Alice in Wonderland (2010 film)|Alice in Wonderland]]'' (2010), voiced by [[Christopher Lee]]. An abridged version of the poem is spoken by the Mad Hatter (played by [[Johnny Depp]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/bryan-young/review-tim-burtons-emalic_b_484160.html|title=Review: Tim Burton's ''Alice in Wonderland'' - Bryan Young|work=The Huffington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sainsburysentertainment.co.uk/en/Films-TV/Blu-ray/Anne-Hathaway/Alice-In-Wonderland-3D/product.html?product=E10365714 ''Alice In Wonderland''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130114221359/http://www.sainsburysentertainment.co.uk/en/Films-TV/Blu-ray/Anne-Hathaway/Alice-In-Wonderland-3D/product.html?product=E10365714 |date=14 January 2013 }}, profile, Sainsbury's entertainment&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Jargon File''' is a [[glossary]] and [[usage dictionary]] of [[slang]] used by [[computer programmers]]. The original Jargon File was a collection of terms from technical cultures such as the [[MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory|MIT AI Lab]], the [[Stanford University centers and institutes#Stanford Artificial Intelligence Laboratory|Stanford AI Lab]] (SAIL) and others of the old [[ARPANET]] [[Artificial intelligence|AI]]/[[Lisp programming language|LISP]]/[[PDP-10]] communities, including [[BBN Technologies|Bolt, Beranek and Newman]], [[Carnegie Mellon University]], and [[Worcester Polytechnic Institute]]. It was published in paperback form in 1983 as '''''The Hacker's Dictionary''''' (edited by [[Guy L. Steele Jr.|Guy Steele]]), revised in 1991 as '''''The New Hacker's Dictionary''''' (ed. [[Eric S. Raymond]]; third edition published 1996).

==1975 to 1983==
The Jargon File (referred to here as "Jargon-1" or "the File") was made by [[Raphael Finkel]] at [[Stanford University|Stanford]] in 1975. From that time until the plug was finally pulled on the [[Stanford AI Lab|SAIL]] computer in 1991, the File was named "AIWORD.RF[UP,DOC]" ("[UP,DOC]" was a system directory for "User Program DOCumentation" on the WAITS operating system). Some terms, such as ''[[wikt:frob|frob]]'', ''[[foo]]'' and ''[[Mung (computer term)|mung]]'' are believed to date back to the early 1950s from the [[Tech Model Railroad Club]] at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] and documented in the 1959  ''Dictionary of the TMRC Language'' compiled by Peter Samson.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.catb.org/~esr/jargon/html/T/TMRC.html |title=TMRC |work=The Jargon File}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tmrc.mit.edu/dictionary.html |title=Dictionary of the TMRC Language}}&lt;/ref&gt; The revisions of Jargon-1 were all unnumbered and may be collectively considered "version 1". Note that it was always called "AIWORD" or "the Jargon file", never "the File"; the latter term was coined by Eric Raymond.

In 1976, [[Mark Crispin]], having seen an announcement about the File on the SAIL computer, [[File Transfer Protocol|FTP]]ed a copy of the File to the MIT AI Lab. He noticed that it was hardly restricted to "AI words" and so stored the file on his directory, named as "AI:MRC;SAIL JARGON" ("AI" lab computer, directory "MRC", file "SAIL JARGON").

Raphael Finkel dropped out of active participation shortly thereafter and [[Don Woods (programmer)|Don Woods]] became the SAIL contact for the File (which was subsequently kept in duplicate at SAIL and MIT, with periodic resynchronizations).

The File expanded by fits and starts until 1983. [[Richard Stallman]] was prominent among the contributors, adding many MIT and [[Incompatible Timesharing System|ITS]]-related coinages. The Incompatible Timesharing System (ITS) was named to distinguish it from another early MIT computer operating system, The Compatible Timesharing System.

In 1981, a [[Hacker (programmer subculture)|hacker]] named Charles Spurgeon got a large chunk of the File published in [[Stewart Brand]]'s ''[[CoEvolution Quarterly]]'' (issue 29, pages 26–35) with illustrations by [[Phil Wadler]] and Guy Steele (including a couple of Steele's Crunchly cartoons). This appears to have been the File's first paper publication.

A late version of Jargon-1, expanded with commentary for the mass market, was edited by Guy Steele into a book published in 1983 as ''The Hacker's Dictionary'' (Harper &amp; Row CN 1082, {{ISBN|0-06-091082-8}}). It included all of Steele's Crunchly cartoons. The other Jargon-1 editors (Raphael Finkel, Don Woods, and Mark Crispin) contributed to this revision, as did Stallman and [[Geoff Goodfellow]]. This book (now out of print) is hereafter referred to as "Steele-1983" and those six as the Steele-1983 coauthors.

==1983 to 1990==
Shortly after the publication of Steele-1983, the File effectively stopped growing and changing. Originally, this was due to a desire to freeze the file temporarily to ease the production of Steele-1983, but external conditions caused the "temporary" freeze to become permanent.

The AI Lab culture had been hit hard in the late 1970s by funding cuts and the resulting administrative decision to use vendor-supported hardware and associated [[proprietary software]] instead of homebrew whenever possible. At MIT, most AI work had turned to dedicated [[Lisp machine]]s. At the same time, the commercialization of AI technology lured some of the AI Lab's best and brightest away to startups along the [[Massachusetts Route 128|Route 128]] strip in Massachusetts and out west in [[Silicon Valley]]. The startups built Lisp machines for MIT; the central MIT-AI computer became a [[TOPS-20|TWENEX]] system rather than a host for the AI hackers' beloved ITS.

The Stanford AI Lab had effectively ceased to exist by 1980, although the SAIL computer continued as a computer science department resource until 1991. Stanford became a major TWENEX site, at one point operating more than a dozen TOPS-20 systems, but by the mid-1980s, most of the interesting software work was being done on the emerging [[Berkeley Software Distribution|BSD Unix]] standard.

In May 1983, the [[PDP-10]]-centered cultures that had nourished the File were dealt a death-blow by the cancellation of the [[Jupiter project]] at [[Digital Equipment Corporation|DEC]]. The File's compilers, already dispersed, moved on to other things. Steele-1983 was partly a monument to what its authors thought was a dying tradition; no one involved realized at the time just how wide its influence was to be.{{Citation needed|date=March 2007}}

As mentioned in some editions:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.catb.org/jargon/oldversions/jarg262.txt {{sc2|THIS IS THE JARGON FILE, VERSION 2.6.2, 14 FEB 1991}}]&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|1=By the mid-1980s, the File's content was dated, but the legend that had grown up around it never quite died out.  The book, and softcopies obtained off the [[ARPANET]], circulated even in cultures far removed from MIT's; the content exerted a strong and continuing influence on hackish slang and humor.  Even as the advent of the microcomputer and other trends fueled a tremendous expansion of hackerdom, the File (and related materials like the AI Koans in Appendix A) came to be seen as a sort of sacred epic, a hacker-culture [[Matter of Britain]] chronicling the heroic exploits of the Knights of the Lab.  The pace of change in hackerdom at large accelerated tremendously, but the Jargon File passed from living document to icon and remained essentially untouched for seven years.}}

==1990 and later==
A new revision was begun in 1990, which contained nearly the entire text of a late version of Jargon-1 (a few obsolete PDP-10-related entries were dropped after consultation with the editors of Steele-1983). It merged in about 80% of the Steele-1983 text, omitting some framing material and a very few entries introduced in Steele-1983 that are now only of historical interest.

The new version cast a wider net than the old Jargon File; its aim was to cover not just AI or PDP-10 hacker culture but all of the technical computing cultures in which the true hacker-nature is manifested. More than half of the entries now derived from [[Usenet]] and represent jargon then current in the [[C (programming language)|C]] and [[Unix]] communities, but special efforts were made to collect jargon from other cultures including [[IBM PC]] programmers, [[Amiga]] fans, [[Apple Macintosh|Mac]] enthusiasts, and even the IBM [[Mainframe computer|mainframe]] world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://comlay.net/ibmjarg.pdf | title = IBM Jargon Dictionary Tenth Edition (1990)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eric Raymond maintained the new File with assistance from Guy Steele, and is the credited editor of the print version of it, ''The New Hacker's Dictionary'' (published by [[MIT Press]] in 1991); hereafter Raymond-1991. Some of the changes made under his watch were controversial; early critics accused Raymond of unfairly changing the file's focus to the Unix hacker culture instead of the older hacker cultures where the Jargon File originated. Raymond has responded by saying that the nature of hacking had changed and the Jargon File should report on hacker culture, and not attempt to enshrine it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.catb.org/jargon/jargtxt.html | title = Updating JARGON.TXT Is Not Bogus: An Apologia | last = Raymond | first = Eric | accessdate = 2007-01-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; After the second edition of ''NHD'' (MIT Press, 1993; hereafter Raymond-1993), Raymond was accused of adding terms reflecting his own politics and vocabulary,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.ntk.net/2003/06/06/ | title = Need To Know 2003-06-06 | accessdate = 2007-01-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; even though he says that entries to be added are checked to make sure that they are in live use, not "just the private coinage of one or two people".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.catb.org/jargon/submissions.html|title = You Too, Can Add an Entry!|date = 29 December 2003|accessdate = 28 January 2015|website = Jargon File|publisher = |last = Raymond|first = Eric S.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Raymond version was revised again, to include terminology from the nascent subculture of the public Internet and the World Wide Web, and published by MIT Press as ''The New Hacker's Dictionary'', Third Edition, in 1996 (hereafter Raymond-1996).

{{As of|2016|01}}, no updates have been made to the official Jargon File since 2003.  A volunteer editor&lt;!--Asked not to be named in the article prose, and is not notable, so mentioned only in abbreviated form in citation.--&gt; produced two updates, reflecting later influences (mostly excoriated) from [[SMS language|text messaging language]], [[LOLspeak]], and [[Internet slang]] in general; the last was produced in January 2012.&lt;ref name="volunteer"&gt;{{cite web |last=Raymond |first=Eric S. |title=The Jargon File |version=5.0.1 |work= cosman246.com |editor-first=Y. |editor-last=Tulsyan |date=2002-01-05 |url=http://cosman246.com/jargon.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130827121341/http://cosman246.com/jargon.html |archive-date=2013-08-27 |accessdate=2015-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impact and reception==

===Influence===
Despite its tongue-in-cheek approach, multiple other [[style guides]] and similar works have cited ''The New Hacker's Dictionary'' as a reference, and even recommended following some of its "hackish" best practices. The [[Oxford English Dictionary]] has used the ''NHD'' as a source for computer-related [[neologism]]s.&lt;ref name="JFR" /&gt;  ''[[The Chicago Manual of Style]]'', the leading American academic and book-publishing style guide, beginning with its 15th edition (2003) explicitly defers, for "computer writing", to the quotation punctuation style{{snd}} ''[[logical quotation]]''{{snd}} recommended by the essay "Hacker Writing Style" in ''The New Hacker's Dictionary'' (and cites ''NHD'' for nothing else).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Chicago Manual of Style |edition=15th |chapter=Closing Quotation Marks in Relation to Other Punctuation: 6.8. Period and commas |page=242 |date=August 2003 |publisher=U. of Chicago Pr |isbn=978-0-321115-83-6 |quote=For related matters in computer writing, see Eric S. Raymond, "Hacker Writing Style," in ''The New Hacker's Dictionary'' (bibliog. 5).}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The 16th edition (2010, and the current issue {{as of|lc=y|2016}}) does likewise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Chicago Manual of Style |edition=16th |chapter=Computer Terms: 7.75.

That manual is the [[Style guide|house style]] of NGS publications, and has been available online for public browsing since 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Sources |date=2014 |editor1-first=David |editor1-last=Brindley |editor2-last=Style Committee |work=National Geographic Style Manual |publisher=[[National Geographic Society]] |location=Washington, DC |url= http://stylemanual.natgeo.com/4-sources |access-date=September 22, 2015 &lt;!--If ever needed: |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20150922053043/http://stylemanual.ngs.org/4-sources |archive-date=September 22, 2015--&gt;}} {{As of|2016}}, it was last updated in 2014&lt;/ref&gt; The ''NGSM'' does not specify what, in particular, it drew from the ''NHD'' or any other source.

Aside from these guides and the ''Encyclopedia of New Media'', the Jargon file, especially in print form, is frequently cited for both its definitions and its essays, by books and other works on hacker history, [[cyberpunk]] subculture, computer jargon and online style, and the rise of the Internet as a public medium, in works as diverse as the 20th edition of ''A Bibliography of Literary Theory, Criticism and Philology'' edited by José Ángel García Landa (2015); ''Wired Style: Principles of English Usage in the Digital Age'' by Constance Hale and Jessie Scanlon of ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'' magazine (1999); ''Transhumanism: The History of a Dangerous Idea'' by David Livingstone (2015); Mark Dery's ''Flame Wars: The Discourse of Cyberculture'' (1994) and ''Escape Velocity: Cyberculture at the End of the Century'' (2007); ''Beyond Cyberpunk! A Do-it-yourself Guide to the Future'' by [[Gareth Branwyn]] and Peter Sugarman (1991); and numerous others.

''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine used ''The New Hacker's Dictionary'' (Raymond-1993) as the basis for an article about online culture in the November 1995 inaugural edition of the "Time Digital" department. ''NHD'' was cited by name on the front page of ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]''.{{when|date=September 2015|reason=This is really significant; find it!}}  Upon the release of the second edition, ''[[Newsweek]]'' used it as a primary source, and quoted entries in a sidebar, for a major article on the Internet and its history.{{when|date=September 2015|reason=This is really significant; find it!}}  The [[MTV]] show ''This Week in Rock'' used excerpts from the Jargon File in its "CyberStuff" segments. ''[[Computing Reviews]]'' used one of the Jargon File's definitions on its December 1991 cover.

On October 23, 2003, ''The New Hacker's Dictionary'' was used in a legal case. [[SCO Group]] cited the Raymond-1996 definition of "FUD" ([[fear, uncertainty and doubt]]), which dwelt on questionable [[International Business Machines Corporation|IBM]] business practices, in a legal filing in the civil lawsuit ''[[SCO Group, Inc. v. International Business Machines Corp.]]''.&lt;ref name="Raymond note"&gt;{{cite web |quote=On 23 October 2003, the Jargon File achieved the dubious honor of being cited in the SCO-vs.-IBM lawsuit. See the FUD entry for details. |url= http://www.catb.org/~esr/jargon/ |title=The Jargon File, version 4.4.8 [sic] |work=CatB.org |first=Eric S. |last=Raymond |date=October 1, 2004 |access-date=January 5, 2016}} The correct version number is actually 4.4.7, as given in the rest of the documents there.&lt;/ref&gt;  (In response, Raymond added SCO to the entry in a revised copy of the ''Jargon File'', feeling that SCO's own practices deserved similar criticism.&lt;ref name="FUD"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.catb.org/~esr/jargon/html/F/FUD.html |title=FUD |work=The Jargon File |version=4.4.7 |date=December 29, 2003 |editor-first=Eric S. |editor-last=Raymond}}&lt;/ref&gt;)

===Defense of the term ''hacker''===
The book is particularly noted for helping (or at least trying) to preserve the distinction between a [[Hacker culture|hacker]] (a consummate programmer) and a [[System cracker|cracker]] (a [[Cybercrime|computer criminal]]); even though not reviewing the book in detail, both the ''[[London Review of Books]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lrb.co.uk/v15/n21/ian-stewart/oops|title=Oops|first=Ian|last=Stewart|date=4 November 1993|publisher=|pages=38–39|accessdate=18 October 2016|via=London Review of Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[MIT Technology Review]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.technologyreview.com/review/403795/hack-license/|title=Hack License|first=Simson|last=Garfinkel|publisher=|accessdate=18 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; remarked on it in this regard.  In a substantial entry on the work, the ''Encyclopedia of New Media'' by Steve Jones (2002) observed that this defense of the term ''hacker'' was a motivating factor for both Steele's and Raymond's print editions:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Encyclopedia of New Media: An Essential Reference to Communication and Technology |first=Steve |last=Jones |date=December 2002 |publisher=[[SAGE Publications]] |isbn=978-1-452265-28-5 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=YgVzAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA345&amp;lpg=PA345&amp;dq=%22Hacker%27s+Dictionary%22+%22Mondo+2000%22+-amazon&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=iaV45cE4UE&amp;sig=L3akSlyLf4Saj4U24ov9hlXVLso&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CDQQ6AEwBGoVChMIm7mH6LWKyAIVQzSICh1h_wWx#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Hacker's%20Dictionary%22%20%22Mondo%202000%22%20-amazon&amp;f=false |access-date=September 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{quote|''The Hacker's Dictionary'' and ''The New Hacker's Dictionary'' sought to celebrate hacker culture, provide a repository of hacking history for younger and future hackers, and perhaps most importantly, to represent hacker culture in a positive light to the general public. In the early 1990s in particular, many news stories emerged portraying hackers as law-breakers with no respect for the personal privacy or property of others. Raymond wanted to show some of the positive values of hacker culture, particularly the hacker sense of humor. Because love of humorous wordplay is a strong element of hacker culture, a slang dictionary works quite well for such purposes.}}

===Reviews and reactions===

''[[PC Magazine]]'' in 1984, stated that ''The Hacker's Dictionary'' was superior to most other computer-humor books, and noted its authenticity to "hard-core programmers' conversations", especially slang from MIT and Stanford.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Hacker Spoken Here |last=Langdell |first=James |work=PC Magazine |date=April 3, 1984 |page=39 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=e-gI2W-3JwkC&amp;lpg=PA385&amp;pg=PA39#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true |accessdate=October 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Reviews quoted by the publisher include: [[William Safire]] of ''[[New York Times]]'' referring to the Raymond-1991 ''NHD'' as a "sprightly lexicon" and recommending it as a nerdy gift that holiday season&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=On Language |first=William |last=Safire |author-link=William Safire |date=December 8, 1991 |work=[[The New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; (this reappeared in his "On Language" column again in mid-October 1992); [[Hugh Kenner]] in ''[[Byte (magazine)|Byte]]'' suggesting that it was so engaging that one's reading of it should be "severely timed if you hope to get any work done";&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Print Queue |first=Hugh |last=Kenner |date=January 1992 |work=[[Byte (magazine)|Byte]] |publisher=[[UBM plc|UBM]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Mondo 2000]]'' describing it as "slippery, elastic fun with language", as well as "not only a useful guidebook to very much un-official technical terms and street tech slang, but also a de facto ethnography of the early years of the hacker culture."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Reviews: ''The New Hacker's Dictionary'', Third Edition |work=MITPress.MIT.edu |date=2015 |publisher=[[Massachusetts Institute of Technology Press]] |location=Cambridge, MA |url= https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/new-hackers-dictionary |access-date=September 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Positive reviews were also published in academic as well as computer-industry publications, including ''[[IEEE Spectrum]]'', ''[[New Scientist]]'', ''[[PC Magazine]]'', ''[[PC World]]'', ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'', and (repeatedly) ''Wired''.

US game designer [[Steve Jackson (US game designer)|Steve Jackson]], writing for ''[[bOING bOING]]'' magazine in its pre-blog, print days, described ''NHD''&lt;nowiki /&gt;'s essay "A Portrait of J. Random Hacker" as "a wonderfully accurate pseudo-demographic description of the people who make up the hacker culture."  He was nevertheless critical of Raymond's tendency to editorialize, even "[[Internet flaming|flame]]", and of the Steele cartoons, which Jackson described as "sophomoric, and embarrassingly out of place beside the dry and sophisticated humor of the text." He wound down his review with some rhetorical questions: "where else will you find, for instance, that one attoparsec per microfortnight is approximately equal to one inch per second? Or an example of the canonical use of ''canonical''? Or a definition like 'A cuspy but bogus raving story about N random broken people'?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The New Hacker's Dictionary: Book review |first=Steve |last=Jackson |authorlink=Steve Jackson (US game designer) |work=SJGames.com |date=1991 |publisher=[[Steve Jackson Games]] |url= http://www.sjgames.com/hacker/hackdict.rev.html |access-date=September 22, 2015}} Originally published in ''[[bOING bOING]]'' magazine, Vol. 1, No. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

The third print edition garnered additional coverage, in the usual places like ''Wired'' (August 1996), and even in mainstream venues like ''[[People (magazine)|People]]'' magazine (October 21, 1996).&lt;ref name="JFR"&gt;{{cite web |title=The Book on the File |first=Eric S. |last=Raymond |author-link=Eric S.

'''Kalaba-X''' is a simple [[constructed language]] created by the [[United States|American]] [[Linguistics|linguist]] [[Kenneth L. Pike]] to help with the teaching of [[translation]] techniques.

Each sentence in Kalaba-X has a fixed structure, consisting of three sentence parts: [[verb]], [[object (grammar)|object]], [[subject (grammar)|subject]], or more exactly, [[predicate (grammar)|predicate]] (affirmation or assertion of a general status fact or occurring event), [[Object (grammar)|object]] (that indicates or restricts where the action applies or takes place, or allows qualifying it more precisely), [[Subject (grammar)|subject]] (any triggering condition under which the fact can occur, and without which the predicate would not have occurred).

Under such definition, the grammatical structure of other languages can be more easily compared to each other, using Kalaba-X as a formal intermediate language for studying the language semantic (for example, this theoretical model does not define a grammatical difference between a noun and a verb, or between a verb and an adjective, as it is found in most European languages, because most nouns or adjectives of European languages can also be a predicate by themselves).

Each of these three parts, which are linked semantically rather than grammatically, can be modified. By focusing on the semantic rather than the grammatical structure of the source or target language, this constructed language can be used as an intermediate tool for producing better translations, notably between languages that have very different grammatical structures and where the semantic is organized differently into one or more subordinated sentences.

For example, the English sentence "This picture is very beautiful." would be structured in Kalaba-X as if it were written "Beautiful very, picture this, me." where the subject (me) is explicitly given in Kalaba-X rather than being subjectively implied by the context. Under such translation, the effective semantic of the sentence is "I (find that) this picture is very beautiful." where the author of the sentence is responsible for this affirmation. The English grammar may hide the fact that the "beautiful" adjective translates the concept of "enjoying", a true verb, so a simpler Kalaba-X sentence would be better "Enjoy a lot, picture this, me." But the analysis does not stop there, because Kalaba-X features no pronouns, i.e. no ambiguous substitutes; a more exact analysis would give "Enjoy a lot, picture here, speaker."

But other translations would be possible to indicate whether the opinion is personal or admitted more generally, by adding modifiers (considered adjectives in Kalaba-X) to the subject part (considered a noun) to condition the sentence, or to the object part (also considered a noun) to extend the scope of the predicate. Adding more modifiers in Kalaba-X to the initial verb part of such sentence can make the semantic more precise by including various modes (including tense, variability, recurrence, progress, negation...) but also logical composition relations like unions, intersections and exclusions).

[[Chad]] has two official languages, [[French language|French]] and [[Modern Standard Arabic]], and over 120 indigenous languages.  A vernacular version of Arabic, [[Chadian Arabic]], is the [[lingua franca]].  Of the two official languages, French has the most speakers in Chad (though Chadian Arabic has more speakers in Chad than both French and Standard Arabic) [http://ec.europa.eu/development/body/publications/courier/courier197/en/en_017.pdf]. Chad submitted an application to join the [[Arab League]] as a [[Member states of the Arab League|member state]] on 25 March 2014, which is still pending.&lt;ref&gt;[[Middle East Monitor]]: [https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/20140412-south-sudan-and-chad-apply-to-join-the-arab-league ''South Sudan and Chad apply to join the Arab League''], 12 April 2014, retrieved 6 May 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Chadian Sign Language]] is actually [[Nigerian Sign Language]], a dialect of [[American Sign Language]]; [[Andrew Foster (educator)|Andrew Foster]] introduced ASL in the 1960s, and Chadian teachers for the deaf train in Nigeria.

'''Leeward Caribbean Creole English''', also known by the names of the various islands on which it is spoken (Antiguan Creole, Saint Kitts Creole, etc.), is an [[English-based creole language]] spoken in the [[Leeward Islands]] of the Caribbean, namely the countries of [[Antigua]] and [[Barbuda]], [[Montserrat]], [[Saint Kitts]], and [[Nevis]]. It is part of a wider English Creole Language spoken throughout the Caribbean region in the countries of Antigua ad Barbuda, Belize, Montserrat, and Jamaica Saint Kitts and Nevis

There are subtle differences in the language's usage by different speakers, and islanders often use it in combination with [[Standard English]]. The tendency to switch back and forth from Creole to Standard English often seems to correlate with the class status of the speaker. Persons of higher [[social status]] tend to switch between Standard English and Creole more readily, due to their more extensive formal education in the English-language school system. Creole usage is more common, and is less similar to Standard English, as speakers descend the [[social mobility|socioeconomic ladder]].

Many Creole words are derived from [[English language|English]] or [[African languages|African]] origins. The creole was formed when [[slaves]] owned by English planters imitated the English of their enslavers but pronounced it with their own inflections. This can be easily seen in phrases such as "Me nah go," meaning "I am not going," or in "Ent it?," presumably a cognate of "Ain't it?"

==Vocabulary==

Vocabulary is widely influenced by British vocabulary, due to centuries of association with [[Great Britain]]. Examples:

* ''Bonnet'' refers to the [[Hood (vehicle)|hood]] of a car.
* ''Chips'' refers to [[French Fries]]. However, ''fries'' is commonly used as well.
* ''Form'' is used instead of the American high school ''grade''. (7th Grade-1st Form; 11th Grade-5th Form)
* ''Car park'' instead of ''parking lot''.
* ''[[Jamaican patty|Patty]]'' for flaky folded [[pastry]], unlike the American patty, meaning [[hamburger]] patty.
* ''[[wikt:mongrel|Mongrel]]'' is used instead of the US ''[[Mixed-breed dog|mutt]]''.
* ''[[Biscuit]]'' is used instead of the US ''[[cookie]]''.

However, in other cases the American form prevails over the British one, due to the islands' close proximity to the United States:

* ''Apartment'' is used instead of the British ''flat''.
* ''Elevator'' instead of the British ''lift''.

Because of the influx of other Caribbean nationals to Antigua, due to natural migration and to the [[CSME]], Antigua's everyday vocabulary is being influenced by [[Jamaican Creole]], [[Bajan Creole]], [[Guyanese Creole]] and [[Trinidadian Creole]]. This is even more common among the youth. Examples:

* ''Yute'' and ''star'' meaning young man.
* ''Breda'' (derived from ''Brethren'' and ''Partner'') meaning close friend.
* ''Sell off'' meaning excellent or very good.

Antiguan is pronounced very similarly to Jamaican. This has led some to surmise that the slaves of these countries came from the same place in Africa. Below are a few ways in which some language blends are fused or changed completely.

* "TR" as in 'Truck' is pronounced "CH", thus: 'Chruck.'
* "DR" as in 'Dress' is pronounced" J", thus: 'Jess'
* "TH" as in 'Them' is pronounced "D", thus: 'Dem'
* "TH" as in 'Think' is pronounced "T", thus: 'Tink'
* "WN" as in 'Down' is pronounced "NG", thus: 'Dung'
* "V" as in 'Vex' is pronounced "B", thus: 'Bex'
* Sometimes an ending "T" is left off and words such as 'Best' sound like 'Bess'. Expect sounds like 'Expeck'; and 'Left' sounds like 'Leff'.

==Language use==

Antiguan Creole is used in almost every aspect of life in Antigua. In all schools, during class hours, it is required of students to speak [[Standard English]]. This policy is especially exercised in private owned schools. Most media and mainstream communication is written and spoken in [[Standard English]], although Antiguan Creole is sometimes used humorously or as a way of identifying with the local public.

Use of Antiguan Creole varies depending on socio-economic class. In general, the higher and middle classes use it amongst friends and family but switch to Standard English in the public sphere. The lower class tend to use Antiguan Creole in almost every sector of life.

==The Pronominal System==

# The pronominal system of Standard English has a four-way distinction of person, singular/plural, gender and nominative/objective. Some varieties of Antiguan Creole do not have the gender or nominative/objective distinction, though most do; but usefully, it does distinguish between the second person singular and plural (you).

I, me = me;
you, you (thou, thee) = yu;
he, him = he;
she, her = she; 
we, us = ah-we;
they, them = dem;

To form the possessive form of the pronoun add "fu-" to the above. However, the pronoun "our" is an exception where we add "ar-".

my, mine = fu-mi;
your, yours (thy, thine) = fu-yu;
his, his = fu-he;
her, hers = fu-she;
our, ours = ah-we;
you all = ah-yu;
their, theirs = fu-dem

Example:
# a fu-yu daag dat?, is that your dog?
# a fu-yu daag dat day nuh, that is your dog.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="24397">'''Mental toughness''' is a measure of individual resilience and confidence that may predict success in sport, education and the workplace. As a broad concept, it emerged in the context of sports training, in the context of a set of attributes that allow a person to become a better athlete and able to cope difficult training and  difficult competitive situations and emerge without losing [[confidence]]. In recent decades, the term has been commonly used by coaches, [[Sport psychology|sport psychologists]], [[sports commentator]]s, and business leaders.

There are several factors as to why a positive mentality or mental toughness is a huge benefactor to success. An elite athlete must be able to handle pressure, have self-belief and avoid any lifestyle distractions. They must have that urge to win and know that they have all the capabilities to do anything they desire. This separate's the good athletes from the elite athletes (Jones et al.,2002). &lt;ref&gt;Declan Connaughton,2008. The development and maintenance of mental toughness: Perceptions of elite performers. Journal of Sports Sciences, Issue 1, Volume 26, Pages 83-95.&lt;/ref&gt;

 Samples of attributes were taken by Graham Jones to examine differences of success between athletes and which ones possess a strong mentality. It was proven that there were 30 attributes suggesting mental toughness in super elite athlete but only an average of 12 in elite athletes indicating the mental difference to become a super elite performer (Jones et al.,2007). This illustrates how important a positive mentality is for athletes to be successful. &lt;ref&gt;Declan Connaughton,2008. The development and maintenance of mental toughness: Perceptions of elite performers. Journal of Sports Sciences, Issue 1, Volume 26, Pages 83-95.&lt;/ref&gt;

"Mental toughness" is frequently used colloquially to refer to any set of positive attributes that helps a person to cope with difficult situations. Coaches and sport commentators freely use the term mental toughness to describe the mental state of athletes who persevere through difficult sport circumstances to succeed. In support of this, a number of studies have linked mental toughness to sporting success or achievement.&lt;ref&gt;Cowden, R. (2017). Mental toughness and success in sport: A review and prospect. The Open Sports Science Journal, 10, 1-14. doi:10.2174/1875399X01710010001 &lt;/ref&gt; However, it is often simply applied as a default explanation for any victory, which is highly problematic as an attribution. Criticisms about the use of this imprecise approach abound (for example, Moran (2012)&lt;ref&gt;Moran, A. P. (2012). Sport and Exercise Psychology: A Critical Introduction (2nd ed.). Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;).

However, within the past fifteen years, scientific research has attempted a formal definition of mental toughness as a [[Construct validity|psychological construct]] with clear measurement criteria, allowing robust analyses and comparisons to be made.

In particular, three research teams have produced both a definition and a construct definition for mental toughness:

== Jones, Hanton, and Connaughton ==

Graham Jones, Sheldon Hanton, and Declan Connaughton of the United States used [[Personal construct theory|personal construct psychology]] in interviews with elite athletes, as well as elite-level coaches and sport psychologists, to arrive at the following definition of mental toughness:

* Mental toughness is "Having the natural or developed psychological edge that enables you to: generally, cope better than your opponents with the many demands (competition, training, lifestyle) that sport places on a performer; specifically, be more consistent and better than your opponents in remaining determined, focused, confident, and in control under pressure." (Jones, Hanton, &amp; Connaughton, 2002, p.&amp;nbsp;209).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Jones | first1 = G. | last2 = Hanton | first2 = S. | last3 = Connaughton | first3 = D. | year = 2002 | title = What Is This Thing Called Mental Toughness? An Investigation of Elite Sport Performers | url = | journal = Journal of Applied Sport Psychology | volume = 14 | issue = 3| pages = 205–218 | doi = 10.1080/10413200290103509 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

These same researchers published a second paper in 2007, which provided four dimensions (categories) for mental toughness attributes. One general dimension was outlined: a performer's attitude or mindset (specifically, the performer's focus and self-belief). Three time-specific dimensions were outlined: training, competition, and post-competition. These time-specific dimensions contain attributes of mental toughness  (such as handling pressure, handling failure and pushing yourself to your physical limit in training) that pertain to their use at these times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Jones | first1 = G. | last2 = Hanton | first2 = S. | last3 = Connaughton | first3 = D. | year = 2007 | title = A framework of mental toughness in the world's best performers | url = http://www.cabdirect.org/abstracts/20073152280.html | journal = Sport Psychologist | volume = 21 | issue = 2| pages = 243–264 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Clough and Earle ==

Peter Clough et al. (2002) &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Mental Toughness. The Concept and its Management. In: Cockerill, I. (Ed.), Solutions in Sport Psychology.|last=Clough, P. J., K. Earle, and D. Sewell.|first=|publisher=Thomson|year=2002|isbn=|location=London|pages=32-45|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; proposed a model of mental toughness, conceptualising it more like a personality trait. Their model has four components: confidence; challenge; control and commitment. In initially conceptualising mental toughness and developing the MTQ48&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Mental toughness Questionnaire 48: Technical manual.|last=Clough, P. J., Marchant, D. C., &amp; Earle, K.|first=|publisher=AQR|year=2007|isbn=|location=Wrexham|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; questionnaire measurement tool, the approach taken by Clough et al. (2002) was to combine existing psychological theory and applied sport psychology in an attempt to bridge the gap between research and practice. Clough et al. saw clear comparisons between their emerging mental toughness data and the concept of hardiness, a key individual difference and resistance resource that helps buffer stress and has become an accepted concept in health psychology within the study of the stress-illness relationship. Clough et al. are clear that mental toughness is concept with broad application and should not be limited to the sports domain. They feel that sports specific measures are unlikely to move the field forward in any meaningful ways.  The development work relating to their model is fully described and discussed in their book on mental toughness.&lt;ref&gt;Clough, P.J. &amp; Strycharczyk, D (2012)  Applied mental toughness: A tool kit for the 21st Century. Kogan Page {{ISBN|978-0-7494-6377-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Gucciardi, Gordon, and Dimmock ==

Daniel Gucciardi, Sandy Gordon, and James Dimmock of Australia have proposed a different definition and framework of mental toughness, based primarily on their work with Australian footballers. Using [[Personal construct theory|personal construct psychology]], these authors proposed the following definition of mental toughness:

{{quote|Mental toughness in Australian Football is a collection of values, attitudes, behaviors, and emotions that enable you to persevere and overcome any obstacle, adversity, or pressure experienced, but also to maintain concentration and motivation when things are going well to consistently achieve your goals.|Gucciardi, Gordon, &amp; Dimmock, 2008, p.&amp;nbsp;278|&lt;ref name="AF1"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gucciardi | first1 = D. | last2 = Gordon | first2 = S. | last3 = Dimmock | first3 = J. | year = 2008 | title = Towards an Understanding of Mental Toughness in American Football | url = | journal = Journal of Applied Sport Psychology | volume = 20 | issue = 3| pages = 261–281 | doi = 10.1080/10413200801998556 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Some psychologists have argued that a separate, sport-specific definitions of mental toughness should be developed.&lt;ref&gt;Crust, L. (2007). Mental toughness in sport: A review. ''International Journal of Sport and Exercise Psychology'', 5(3), 270-290. Retrieved from http://www.informaworld.com/index/934187662.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Crust | first1 = L | year = 2008 | title = A review and conceptual re-examination of mental toughness: Implications for future researchers | url = | journal = Personality and Individual Differences | volume = 45 | issue = 7| pages = 576–583 | doi = 10.1016/j.paid.2008.07.005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They have highlighted that the attributes of a mentally tough athlete in one sport may differ greatly from the attributes of a mentally tough athlete in a different sport. Differences have been hypothesized between male and female athletes, as well as between "team sport" and "individual sport" athletes, but to date, little empirical evidence has shown what these differences are.

These studies have not employed a common framework, although many have used the definition of mental toughness provided by either the Jones et al. study, or the Gucciardi ''et al.'' study.

Many sports focussed studies have employed the Clough model of mental toughness.  They have, using samples of athletes, shown a link between toughness, coping, emotional reactivity, psychological skills and performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Crust | first1 = L | year = 2009 | title = The relationship between mental toughness and affect intensity | url = | journal = Personality and Individual Differences | volume = 47 | issue = | pages = 959–963 | doi=10.1016/j.paid.2009.07.023}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Crust | first1 = L. | last2 = Azadi | first2 = K. | year = 2010 | title = Mental toughness and athletes' use of psychological strategies | url = | journal = European Journal of Sport Science | volume = 10 | issue = | pages = 43–51 | doi=10.1080/17461390903049972}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Nicholls | first1 = A. | last2 = Polman | first2 = R. | last3 = Levy | first3 = A. | last4 = Backhouse | first4 = S. | year = 2008 | title = Mental toughness, optimism, and coping among athletes | url = | journal = Personality and Individual Differences | volume = 44 | issue = | pages = 1182–1192 | doi=10.1016/j.paid.2007.11.011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the few published studies that takes mental toughness out of the sporting domain is based on the [[#Clough and Earle|4 'C's]] model. In this study it was shown that senior managers are tougher than their junior colleagues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Marchant | first1 = D. | last2 = Polman | first2 = R. | last3 = Clough | first3 = P.J. | last4 = Jackson | first4 = J.G. | last5 = Levy | first5 = A. | last6 = Nicholls | first6 = A.R. | year = 2009 | title = Mental toughness: Managerial and age differences | url = | journal = Journal of Managerial Psychology | volume = 24 | issue = 5| pages = 428–437 | doi=10.1108/02683940910959753}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clough and his team are working in a number of areas outside of sport – education, health, social as well as occupational to explore the relevance of mental toughness in these areas.

=== Developmental studies ===
There is an active debate about whether mental toughness is primarily a developed characteristic, or has  a genetic basis. Two studies  suggest that foundational processes occur during development that allow a person to build mental toughness throughout life. For instance, a study of American soccer players, parents, and coaches found that parents provide a "generalized form" of mental toughness upon which coaches can build a sport-specific form of mental toughness.&lt;ref name="AUSOC"/&gt; A similar study suggested that mental toughness development proceeds first through the development of a tough attitude (strong focus and strong self-belief); upon a tough attitude, an athlete learns how to develop mental toughness attributes needed for training, then for competition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Connaughton | first1 = D. | last2 = Hanton | first2 = S. | last3 = Jones | first3 = G. | year = 2010 | title = The development and maintenance of mental toughness in the World's best performers | url = http://www.cabdirect.org/abstracts/20103259744.html | journal = The Sport Psychologist | volume = 24 | issue = | pages = 168–193 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another study examined the developmental experiences of ten super-elite athletes and found that coaches and significant adults played an important role in mental toughness development through all stages of talent development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Connaughton | first1 = D. | last2 = Wadey | first2 = R. | last3 = Hanton | first3 = S. | last4 = Jones | first4 = G. | year = 2008 | title = The development and maintenance of mental toughness: perceptions of elite performers | url = | journal = Journal of sports sciences | volume = 26 | issue = 1| pages = 83–95 | doi = 10.1080/02640410701310958 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Conversely, the work of Horsburgh et al. (2009) demonstrates that genetic and non-shared environmental factors contribute to the development of mental toughness (as measured by the MTQ48), and that mental toughness behaves "in the same manner as virtually every personality trait that has ever been investigated in behavioural genetic study".&lt;ref&gt;p.&amp;nbsp;104&lt;/ref&gt; In establishing significant relationships with the big five personality factors of Costa and McCrae (1992), these researchers have also provided evidence to support Clough et al.’s conceptualisation of mental toughness.&lt;ref name="Horsburgh, V. 2009"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Horsburgh | first1 = V. | last2 = Schermer | first2 = J. | last3 = Veselka | first3 = L. | last4 = Vernon | first4 = P. | year = 2009 | title = A behavioral genetic study of mental toughness and personality | url = | journal = Personality and Individual Differences | volume = 46 | issue = | pages = 100–105 | doi=10.1016/j.paid.2008.09.009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whilst clearly embracing the importance of genetics, Clough clearly acknowledges that mental toughness can be developed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Crust | first1 = L | last2 = Clough | first2 = P.J. | year = 2011 | title = Developing Mental Toughness: From Research to Practice | url = | journal = Journal of Sport Psychology in Action | volume = 2 | issue = | pages = 21–32 | doi=10.1080/21520704.2011.563436}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Similar constructs ==
Mental toughness has been equated with better understood constructs from psychology such as [[Resilience (psychology)|resilience]] and [[Hardiness (psychological)|hardiness]]. The term resilience is often incorrectly used interchangeably with mental toughness, and researchers have found the two constructs are positively associated with one another.&lt;ref&gt;Cowden, R.G., Meyer-Weitz, A., &amp; Oppong Asante, K. (2013). Mental toughness in competitive tennis: Relationships with resilience and stress. Frontiers in Psychology, 7(320). doi:10.3389/fpsyg.2016.00320.&lt;/ref&gt; However, psychologists define resilience as a positive adaptive ''process'' of coping with stress and adversity, as opposed to a collection of psychological attributes or personality traits. Hardiness has been suggested as a similar construct to mental toughness. Hardiness has typically been constructed as a [[Trait theory|personality trait]], which is generally seen as stable throughout the lifetime. This differs from the conceptions of mental toughness offered by both Jones et al. and Gucciardi et al. These authors both conceive of mental toughness as unstable, arising in development, fluctuating over time, and varying for an individual performer between different sport and life scenarios. This definitional dilemma plagues the use of the term mental toughness and if mental toughness exists as a valid construct it may on occasion be maladaptive. Evidence to support this contention is derived from a study of overtraining behaviors and mental toughness by Tibbert (2013).&lt;ref&gt;Tibbert, S. J. (2013). MENTAL TOUGHNESS AND OVERTRAINING BEHAVIOURS Unpublished doctoral dissertation, Victoria University.&lt;/ref&gt; She reported that "the MT attributes of mental self-concept and task familiarity displayed moderate curvilinear correlations with sport-specific recovery scales of the RESTQ-Sport. The curvilinear correlations reflect decreasing recovery at the highest levels of MT. The results suggest that some attributes of MT may relate to increased ability to recover whereas other attributes are associated with lower recovery (p.2-3). Arguably mental toughness is more closely linked with goal fixedness rather than adaptability and a flexible mindset, attributes which are central to resilience.

== Measurement ==
Two instruments have been developed and validated since 2009. Gucciardi and colleagues validated the American Football Mental Toughness Inventory (AFMTI),&lt;ref name="AFMTI"/&gt; while Sheard and Golby validated the Sports Mental Toughness Questionnaire (SMTQ).&lt;ref name="SMTQ"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sheard | first1 = M. | last2 = Golby | first2 = J. | last3 = van Wersch | first3 = A. | year = 2009 | title = Progress Toward Construct Validation of the Sports Mental Toughness Questionnaire (SMTQ) | url = | journal = European Journal of Psychological Assessment | volume = 25 | issue = 3| pages = 186–193 | doi = 10.1027/1015-5759.25.3.186 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The MTQ48 pre dates these by some seven years. The factor structure of the MTQ48 has been supported by an independent research grouping led by Horsburgh (2009).&lt;ref name="Horsburgh, V. 2009"/&gt; Dr Lee Crust, University of Lincoln, compared the SMTQ with the MTQ 48 and concluded "Both instruments appear to tap the core components of MT but the MTQ48 seemingly provides a more comprehensive measure".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Crust | first1 = L. | last2 = Swann | first2 = C. | year = 2011 | title = Comparing two measures of mental toughness | url = | journal = Personality and Individual Differences | volume = 50 | issue = | pages = 217–221 | doi=10.1016/j.paid.2010.09.032}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The MTQ48 questionnaire has demonstrable criterion related, construct and content validity. Reliability has been assessed by numerous independent researchers and it has clearly demonstrable internal consistency and test-retest reliability.{{fact|date=April 2018}} All component scales exceed 0.70 and the overall measure has a reliability in excess of 0.90.{{fact|date=April 2018}} &lt;!-- Independent research CFA paper published in December (2012) can be accessed through AQR; MD Doug Strycharczyk was involved in the development of the MTQ48. www.aqr.co.uk--&gt; Nevertheless both the construct validity and the psychometric properties of this test have been questioned by  Andersen (2011).&lt;ref&gt;Andersen, M. B. (2011). Who's mental? Who's tough and who's both? Mutton constructs dressed up as lamb. In: Mental toughness in sport : developments in research and theory. Gucciardi, Daniel F and Gordan, Sandy, eds. Routledge Research in Sport and Exercise Science . Routledge, Abington, Oxon, U.K. ; New York, pp. 69-88.&lt;/ref&gt;

Several other instruments have purported to measure mental toughness, but research has called their validity into question. For example, the Performance Profile Inventory (PPI) developed by Jim Loehr used seven subscales to compute a mental toughness score.  The Mental Toughness Inventory (MTI) developed by Middleton and colleagues measures mental toughness using twelve subscales and appears to show strong theoretical evidence for its formation. However, construct validation has only been performed with a narrow sample of athletes, leaving its psychometric properties up for debate.&lt;ref name="SMTQ"/&gt;

'''Moa Martinson''', born '''Helga Maria Swarts''' sometimes spelt '''Swartz''', (2{{nbsp}}November 1890{{snd}}5{{nbsp}}August 1964) was one of Sweden's most noted authors of [[proletarian literature]].&lt;ref name=arbetaren group=w&gt;{{cite web|last1=Reimerthi|first1=Malin|title=Moa hjälpte läsarna förstå klassamhället|trans-title=Moa helped readers understand the class system|url=http://arbetaren.se/artiklar/moa-hjalpte-lasarna-forsta-klassamhallet/|website=www.arbetaren.se|publisher=[[Arbetaren]]|accessdate=17 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her ambition was to change society with her authorship and to portray the conditions of the working class, and also the personal development of women.{{sfn|Engman|2004|p=7}} Her works were about motherhood, love, poverty, politics, religion, urbanization and the hard living conditions of the working-class woman.{{sfn|Engman|2004|p=60}}

== Early life ==
Martinson was born on 2{{nbsp}}November 1890 in Vårdnäs, [[Linköping Municipality]]. Her mother was Kristina Swartz (sometimes spelt Christina Schwartz) who served as a maid wherever jobs were available. There are no legal records stating who her father was,&lt;ref name=Moa group=w/&gt; but according to researchers Annika Johansson and Bonnie Festin, he was probably Anders Teodor Andersson, a farmhand who served at the Kärr farm in [[Motala]] at the same time as Swartz.&lt;ref name=barndom group=w&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sandelin|first1=Ann-Charlotte|title=På vandring i Moa Martinsons barndom|trans-title=A walk through Moa Martinson's childhood|date=5 April 2015|url=http://www.kultursidan.nu/?p=19340|website=www.kultursidan.nu|publisher=Kultursidan.nu|accessdate=26 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since she carried, what in those days was referred to as an [[Legitimacy (family law)|illegitimate]] child, she had to go to her parents home for the birth. Swartz' father, Nils Peter Swartz, was a poor [[Allotment system|soldier]] who lived with his wife, Carin Olofsdotter, in a derelict [[Torp (architecture)|croft]] in Vårdnäs.&lt;ref name=Moa group=w/&gt;&lt;ref name=liv group=w/&gt;&lt;ref name=berattelsen group=w/&gt; On 17{{nbsp}}February 1891, Swartz sued Andersson{{efn|At that time renamed Lundin by the factory he then worked for.&lt;ref name="far" group=w/&gt;}} for [[child support]] at the Motala [[District courts of Sweden|district court]],{{efn|''Tingsrätten'', up until 1971 called ''häradsrätten''.&lt;ref group=w&gt;{{cite web|title=Tingsrätt|url=http://www.ne.se/uppslagsverk/encyklopedi/l%c3%a5ng/tingsr%c3%a4tt|website=www.ne.se|publisher=[[Nationalencyklopedin]]|accessdate=26 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} where two witnesses testified that they had seen her and Andersson in the same bed around the time the child would have been conceived.&lt;ref name="barndom" group=w/&gt; Andersson failed to appear in court in February as well as on the two following hearings. Swartz finally said that he had gone to America and the proceedings were stayed.&lt;ref name=far group=w&gt;{{cite web|last1=Johansson|first1=Annika|title=Vem var Moa Martinsons far?|trans-title=Who was Moa Martinson's father?|url=http://www.ogf.info/dokument/Lovet-101.pdf|website=www.ogf.info|publisher=Östgöta Genealogiska Förening|accessdate=26 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The identity of her father was unknown to Martinson her entire life, but her speculations about who it could be were an inspiration for her work. In her book ''Pigmamma'' ("''Maid Mother''") she portrays her mother's situation, pregnant with a married man's child.&lt;ref name=NE group=w&gt;{{cite web|title=Moa Martinson|url=http://www.ne.se/uppslagsverk/encyklopedi/l%C3%A5ng/moa-martinson|website=www.ne.se|publisher=[[Nationalencyklopedin]]|accessdate=17 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; At one point she thought that her father was a married man, whom her mother had worked for.&lt;ref name="far" group=w/&gt; Her romantic view of her mysterious father decreased as time went by. In her book ''[[My Mother Gets Married|Mor gifter sig]]'' (''My Mother Gets Married''), written twelve years later, it became clear how much Martinson despised her absent father. In ''Fjäderbrevet'' (''The Feather Letter''), written another six years later, there is no mentioning of him at all.{{sfn|Engman|2004|p=11}}&lt;ref name=Moa group=w&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Furuland |first=Lars|title =H Maria (Moa) Martinson|encyclopedia =[[Svenskt biografiskt lexikon]]|year =1985–1987|publisher =[[National Archives of Sweden]]|location =Stockholm |language=Swedish|volume=25|page=220|url =https://sok.riksarkivet.se/SBL/Presentation.aspx?id=9141|accessdate=17 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the first years of her life, Martinson lived with her paternal grandparents and their youngest daughter Hulda while Swartz worked as a maid or in the [[Textile manufacturing|textile mills]] in [[Norrköping]].&lt;ref name=liv group=w&gt;{{cite web|last1=Engman|first1=Kerstin|title=Moas liv|trans-title=Moa's life|url=http://www.moamartinson.se/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=46&amp;Itemid=29|website=www.moamartinson.se|publisher=The Moa Martinson Literary Society|accessdate=17 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are many discrepancies in the timeline of Martinson's early year between official records and her books. These are most likely due to that her stories built on the oral traditions of the family.&lt;ref name=Moa group=w/&gt; In 1892, her grandfather became ill and died and her grandmother could no longer take care of Martinson so she went to live with her mother. There is no record of where they lived until 1894, when they moved to Norrköping. Swartz earned very little money. In 1894–1896, she worked at Norrköping's wool weaving mills, where working conditions were extremely bad and wages low.{{sfn|Engman|2004|p=14}} During her early school years, Martinson had a stepfather, Alfred Karlsson,&lt;ref name=liv group=w/&gt; who she described as an alcoholic. He was a sometime [[statare]] who worked odd jobs in the countryside outside Norrköping. He married Swartz on 11{{nbsp}}March 1896,&lt;ref name=berattelsen group=w/&gt; and they had three more daughters, but they all died within days of being born.&lt;ref name=liv group=w/&gt; After the years at the textile mill, the family moved several times to different locations in [[Östergötland]], settling down for a time wherever work was available.&lt;ref name=Moa group=w/&gt; This affected Martinson's schooling since they only stayed in one place for a couple of months. Despite this, she left school with high marks after six years in 1903.&lt;ref name=liv group=w/&gt; She was [[Confirmation|confirmated]] in 1905 in Risinge Church, [[Finspång Municipality]], after which she got her first job at a farm in [[Vikbolandet]].&lt;ref name=berattelsen group=w/&gt;

In Martinson's book ''Kvinnor och äppleträd'' (''Women and Apple Trees''), which is set in Norrköping, she described the hard and ruthless situation that she and her mother was in during the 1890s. Because of the book, Martinson was accused for denigration by right-wing  critics, but Martinson said that what she did was the opposite.{{sfn|Engman|2004|p=14}} The different run-down lodgings the family moved in and out of are described in the books ''Kyrkbröllop'' (''Church wedding'') and (''My Mother Gets Married'') as well as in a couple of the short stories in ''Jag möter en diktare'' (''I meet a poet'').&lt;ref name=berattelsen group=w/&gt;

At the age of fifteen, she trained to become a [[Garde manger|pantry chef]];{{sfn|Engman|2004|pp=29–34}} at the time, she was the youngest in that profession in Sweden.&lt;ref name=visitnynas group=w&gt;{{cite web|title=Johannesdal - Moas torp|trans-title=Johannesdal - Moa's torp|url=http://www.visitnynashamn.se/gora/aktorer/johannesdalmoastorp.5.43601185137ec5bcbf780003164.html|website=www.visitnynashamn.se|publisher=Nynäshamns Turistbyrå|accessdate=12 April 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160504202417/http://www.visitnynashamn.se/gora/aktorer/johannesdalmoastorp.5.43601185137ec5bcbf780003164.html|archivedate=4 May 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the summer of 1906, she worked as a kitchen maid in the main restaurant at the [[Norrköping Exhibition of Art and Industry]]. Situated at the top of ''Syltberget'' ("Sylt Hill"), the restaurant was accessed by an 80-steps stairway. In ''Kungens rosor'' (''The King's Roses''), Martinsson recounts her work in the restaurant and mentions the stairs. The novel got its name from a conversation that she had at the exhibition with King [[Oscar II of Sweden]] on 3{{nbsp}}July 1906.{{sfn|Höjer|Höjer|1996|pp=12–45}}{{sfn|Loos|1972|p=109f}} The conversation revolved around flowers, which the King said that he felt had souls. {{As of|2016}}, the stairs remain and have been named "Moa Martinson's Stairs".{{sfn|Höjer|Höjer|1996|pp=43–71}}{{sfn|Kindahl|1994}}

{{quote| "In the midst of summer, she walks down the eighty steps. Counting them out loud one after the other, even though she knows very well their number. It is cloudy, almost dark, even though it is only July. The bright nights are waning. The scents of roses and honeysuckles waft around her. She stops, enthralled by the silence and beauty of the summer night. The noise from the day's bustle still lingers in her ears."|From ''The King's Roses''{{sfn|Martinson|1990}}}}

In 1906, Martinson moved to [[Stockholm]] in the hope of getting a job, but this turned out to be harder than she expected. During the financial depression of 1907–1909, she had to move back to Norrköping. At this time, she followed events related to concerns about the labour market. This period of Martinson's life had a significant impact on her political engagement. She also wrote poems and sent a collection to a notary interested in literature, but her work was rejected.{{sfn|Engman|2004|pp=29–34}} She later described the poems as "lofty", since that was how she thought such texts should be written.&lt;ref name=liv group=w/&gt;

== First marriage ==
In 1908–1909, Martinson worked as a pantry chef at restaurants and hotels in Sweden. In the winter of 1909, she met Karl Johansson in [[Ösmo]]. He was nine years older than her, and was a [[Stonemasonry|stone worker]] who lived with his brother Valfrid and their father Johan Petter in a [[Torp (architecture)|torp]] called Johannesdal, in the woods between Ösmo and [[Sorunda]].&lt;ref name=berattelsen group=w&gt;{{cite web|last1=Johansson|first1=Liz|title=Berättelsen om Moa|trans-title=The story about Moa|url=http://hem.fyristorg.com/artic/moa.html|website=www.hem.fyristorg.com|publisher=Artic News|accessdate=18 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; She became pregnant in March 1909 and Johansson proposed, but Martinson was doubtful about marrying him. Despite this, she and Karl moved to Johannesdal and in her book ''Den osynlige älskaren'' ("''The Invisible Lover''") she wrote about her first year as mother and wife, the hard life in Johannesdal and how she desperately wanted to get away.{{sfn|Engman|2004|p=35}}

In 1910, her first son Olof was born, and in 1922 she and Johansson were married. The reason she hesitated for such a long time to marry him, was partly due to Johansson's drinking and partly because she did not want to live in the dark forest.&lt;ref name=berattelsen group=w/&gt;
After the birth of Olof, the family soon expanded. In 1911, their second son Tore was born, followed by three more sons: Erik in 1913, Manfred in 1914 and Knut in 1916.{{sfn|Engman|2004|p=43}} The birth of Knut was especially hard, since she had to deliver him all alone on the kitchen floor in the torp.&lt;ref name=tell group=w&gt;{{cite web|last1=Tell|first1=Lisbeth|title=DN-gratulerar: Moa – eländets expert.

Life on Johannesdal was poor and hard but the upbringing of her sons was important to Martinson. She was opposed to [[Corporal punishment in the home|spanking]] children and disliked the militant [[Romantic nationalism|nationalistic romanticism]] taught in schools at the time.{{sfn|Engman|2004|p=55}}

== Political involvement ==
[[File:Statyn av Moa Martinsson Norrköping april 2006.jpg|thumb|upright|Statue of Moa Martinsson in Norrköping, by [[Peter Linde]]]]
Martinson's political interest started to develop in 1921, when unemployment in Sweden was higher than ever before, and in 1922 she and Johansson joined the [[Central Organisation of the Workers of Sweden]] where Martinson became very active.{{sfn|Engman|2004|p=60}} To further educate herself, she read the works of authors like [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]], [[Émile Zola]], [[Maxim Gorky]] and [[Martin Andersen Nexø]]. Because of her political interest in better pay and conditions for workers and her ability to speak in any context, she was elected to the municipal council in Sorunda where she represented the [[Swedish Social Democratic Party|labour party]].&lt;ref name=kirjasto group=w&gt;{{cite web|last1=Liukkonen|first1=Petri|title=Moa Martinson (1890-1964) - original name Helga Maria Swartz|url=http://www.kirjasto.sci.fi/moamar.htm|work=Books and Writers|date=2008|publisher=[[Kuusankoski]] Public Library|location=Finland|accessdate=23 February 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140103232550/http://www.kirjasto.sci.fi/moamar.htm|archive-date=3 January 2014|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; She resigned from office in 1926.{{sfn|Engman|2004|p=61–69}}
In November 1922, Martinsson wrote her first article&lt;ref name=svensk group=w&gt;{{cite web|last1=Nilsson|first1=Johan|title=Moa Martinson och de tiotusen timmarna|trans-title=Moa Martinson and the ten thousand hours|url=http://www.svensklararforeningen.se/objfiles/1/FoFMoa10000_350378064.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151118185343/http://www.svensklararforeningen.se/objfiles/1/FoFMoa10000_350378064.pdf|dead-url=yes|archive-date=18 November 2015|website=www.svensklararforeningen.se|publisher=Svenslärarföreningen|accessdate=17 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; for the [[Syndicalism|syndicalist]] paper ''[[Arbetaren]]'''s ("''The Worker's''") page for women.&lt;ref name=SAC group=w&gt;{{cite web|title=Martinson, Moa 1890–1964|url=https://www.sac.se/Om-SAC/Historik/Biografier/Ej-f%C3%A4rdiga-biografier/Martinson,-Moa-1890-1964|website=www.sac.se|publisher=[[Central Organisation of the Workers of Sweden]]|accessdate=17 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; She continued writing for the paper and in 1923 she had articles published weekly in ''Arbetaren''. In her articles she wrote about how men and women should work together for a better world. She engaged in many debates, especially those involving women's issues.{{sfn|Engman|2004|p=70}}

With her work for ''Arbetaren'' she developed her writing skills, but even though she often pushed the boundaries in her articles, she went too far in 1924, when she wrote that women and men should receive equal pay for equal work. Quarrels started at the magazine, resulting in Martinson resigning from the paper, but due to her contributions in ''Arbetaren'' she was now known to the public although mostly in syndicalistic circles.{{sfn|Engman|2004|p=80}}

One author who had significant impact on Martinson was Martin Andersen Näxö. It was the first time she recognized her own experiences in a literary work. She wrote a letter to him, telling him about her own life and also sent an article she had written for ''Arbetaren''. Näxö responded positively, telling her she should write a book about her life. Shortly afterwards Martinson started writing the book ''Pigmamman'' ("''The Maid Mother''"). In 1925, she worked for a new magazine called ''Vi kvinnor'' ("''We women''"), where she contributed with articles, novels and [[causerie]]s.{{sfn|Engman|2004|p=83}}

== Magazine articles ==
In April 1925, Martinson's two youngest sons, Manfred and Knut, went through the ice and drowned in the lake Styran by the torp and she was devastated.&lt;ref name=liv group=w/&gt;{{sfn|Engman|2004|p=94}}&lt;ref name=minnernas group=w/&gt;&lt;ref name=modernist group=w&gt;{{cite web|last1=Altstadt|first1=Ann-Charlott|title=Moa Martinson – modernist &amp; feminist|url=http://www.aftonbladet.se/kultur/article20069439.ab|website=www.aftonbladet.se|publisher=[[Aftonbladet]]|date=26 December 2014|accessdate=17 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; She worked incessantly to keep her grief at bay.&lt;ref name=berattelsen group=w/&gt;

In September 1925, ''Vi Kvinnor'' was discontinued and soon after Martinson started working for ''Arbetaren'' again. She also worked for the paper ''[[Brand (magazine)|Brand]]'' in April 1925, and became part of the political circles in Stockholm. She wrote her first story ''Pigmamma'' ("''Maid Mother''") in 1924–25, and it was published as a serial in ''Brand'' in 1927.&lt;ref name="kirjasto" group=w/&gt; In June 1926, her first article for ''[[Syndikalistiska Arbetarefederationen|Arbetarekuriren]]'' was published{{sfn|Engman|2004|p=96}} and in 1927 her work was published in ''Templar-kuriren'' ("''The [[IOGT-NTO|Templars]] Courier''"), ''Arbetaren'' and ''Nynäshamns-posten'' ("''The Nynäshamn Post''").&lt;ref name=minnernas group=w&gt;{{cite web|last1=Andersson|first1=Karl-Olof|title=Fattiga fann tröst och kraft i Moas böcker|trans-title=Poor people found comfort in Moa's books|url=http://minnenasjournal.nu/fattiga-fann-trost-och-kraft-i-moas-bocker/|website=www.minnenasjournal.nu|publisher=LRF Media|accessdate=19 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October that year, she was also writing for ''[[Tidevarvet]]'' (''The Epoch'') which was a politically radical magazine for women published by the [[Kvinnliga medborgarskolan vid Fogelstad|Fogelstad Citizen School for Women]] with [[Elin Wägner]] as editor. Her first contribution was an article about unemployed men's women. She wrote it under a new signature, Moa, because she did not want the syndicalistic circles she moved in to see that she worked for a liberal magazine. However, her work for ''Tidevarvet'' was mostly novels and stories and her political articles were still published in the syndicalistic press.{{sfn|Engman|2004|p=106}} She had found the name "Moa" in the novel ''Jökeln'' (''Bræen'') by Danish author [[Johannes V. Jensen]], where the character "Moa" was described as the [[Mother goddess|first mother]] of humanity.&lt;ref name=berattelsen group=w/&gt;

In November 1927, Martinson traveled to [[Gothenburg]] at the request of chief editor Welinder at the ''Arbetare-kuriren''. She was hoping to be offered a job at the paper, but instead Welinder wanted her to work as a housemaid for him and do some writing for the magazine in exchange for food and shelter in his house. Martinson turned down the offer.&lt;ref name=berattelsen group=w/&gt; While she was at the editorial office, she met [[Harry Martinson]] for the first time. He was a former sailor,&lt;ref name=minnernas group=w/&gt; now [[hobo]] writer who had been published in ''Brand'' and ''Arbetare-kuriren'' so she had heard of him and read some of his works.{{sfn|Engman|2004|p=115}}

== Johansson's death ==
Shortly after Martinson's return to Johannesdal, her husband was afflicted by a nervous disorder. He started hallucinating and could not eat or sleep. She tried to get him to a doctor but he refused. On 14{{nbsp}}January 1928, Johansson committed suicide by putting a stick of [[dynamite]] in his mouth and lighting the [[Fuse (explosives)|fuse]].&lt;ref name=minnernas group=w/&gt; By then, Martinson had considered divorcing him for a long time since theirs had not been an easy marriage. After Johansson's death her economic situation was difficult. Martinson's friends in Stockholm started a fund-raising and manage to collect [[Swedish krona|SEK]] 3,300 to ease her financial situation. Having lost two sons and one husband, she became very depressed. In March 1928, she took a [[Typewriter|typing]] course at the Fogelstad Citizen School for Women and when she left the school it was as "Moa".{{sfn|Engman|2004|p=118}}
During her stay at Fogelstad, she received a letter from Harry Martinson, who asked if he could come and stay for a while at the torp in Johannesdal so he could work. He arrived in the summer of 1928.{{sfn|Engman|2004|p=120}}

== Second marriage ==
During the summer of 1928, Martinson and Harry fell in love. However, in 1928–1929 she became more depressed and in March 1929, she was hospitalized at [[Södertälje]] hospital. During Martinson's stay in the hospital, Harry lived at Johannesdal and they communicated through letters.{{sfn|Engman|2004|p=140}} On 3{{nbsp}}October 1929, they got married. Shortly thereafter, in May 1930, Harry was diagnosed with [[tuberculosis]] leaving Martinson devastated.{{sfn|Engman|2004|p=149}}

[[File:20120807084529!Martinson, Harry i VJ 1943.jpg|thumb|Harry Martinson in 1943]]
The couple had very little money so in 1932, Martinson sent a draft called ''En man byggde'' ("''A man built''") to publisher Tor Bonnier. She continued to develop the draft during the following year and when it was finalized into a book, the title was changed to ''Kvinnor och Äppleträd''. It was published in 1933, and the author was named as "Moa Martinson".{{sfn|Engman|2004|p=182}} Because of the timing and the theme, the book was categorized as "[[Literary modernism|modernist literature]]".{{sfn|Witt-Brattström|1988|p=51}} This became Martinson's literary debut and it gained a lot of attention. Simultaneously, Harry was diagnosed with [[neurosis]] and Martinson was deeply concerned for him. He was fourteen years younger than she, and their marriage had not been easy.{{sfn|Engman|2004|p=182}} As writers, they also had very different styles. While Martinson was characterized as an unpolished [[Literary realism|realist]], Harry was a refined [[Literary modernism|modernist]].&lt;ref name="kirjasto" group=w /&gt;

During the winter of 1933, their financial situation improved and they rented an apartment in [[Saltsjöbaden]] in the hope of solving their marriage problems. At the beginning of 1934 Harry suffered from depression. Up until then, he had never stayed in one place for such a long time as he had done with Martinson at Johannesdal. He started to leave the apartment now and then without any explanation of why or where he was going, and would be gone for days. Harry's friends blamed Martinson for his disappearance, and there were even those who believed that she was to blame for both his physical and mental pain. Not knowing where her husband was, Martinson soon became desperate with despair and jealousy. She even hired a [[Private investigator|private detective]], but when this yielded nothing, she soon gave up. Unknown to Martinson, Harry had started to see a new woman during his time away from home. According to Engman, the name of the woman was Karin L., and another source, Söderberg, speaks of a love affair with poet [[Karin Boye]] and several other women.{{sfn|Söderblom|1994|p=75}} In the summer of 1934, Harry confessed that he had been seeing another woman but said that he had ended the affair. Martinson became furious, but she forgave him.{{sfn|Engman|2004|pp=192–196}}

However, Harry's affair with Karin was not over and the same summer they traveled to [[Tällberg]] in [[Dalarna]]. Harry told Martinson that he needed to be alone and that it would be good for them to be apart for a while. After a couple of weeks, Harry grew tired of Karin and returned to Johannesdal. During the last years of their marriage, he continued  to wander off now and then from Martinson and Johannesdal.{{sfn|Engman|2004|p=198}}

=== Decline and divorce ===
On 6{{nbsp}}June 1934, Harry abruptly left Martinson and the house in Johannesdal and took to the road again, leaving behind the manuscript for ''[[Flowering Nettle]]'' (''Nässlorna blomma''). When he had been gone ten days, Martinson posted a personal telegram on the [[Sveriges Radio|Swedish radio]]{{efn|Before the event of mobile phones, the Swedish Radio provided a service of reading "personal telegrams" (''personligt telegram'') as well as "wanted" notices from the police, on the radio in connection to some of the newscasts.&lt;ref group=w&gt;{{cite web|last=Samuelsson|first=MarieLouise|title=Radiokrönikan: Utrikeskorrar i radion|trans-title=Radio chronicles: Foreign correspondents on the radio|date=26 June 2007|url=http://www.dn.se/diverse/diverse-hem/radiokronikan-utrikeskorrar-i-radion/|publisher=[[Dagens Nyheter]]|website=www.dn.se|accessdate=28 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=w&gt;{{cite web|last=Viktorin|first=Magnus|title=Hallåmannen - din lots i etern|trans-title=The announcer - your guide through the airwaves|url=http://sverigesradio.se/sida/avsnitt/295087?programid=2702|date=28 December 2013|publisher=[[Sveriges Radio]]|website=www.sverigesradio.se|accessdate=28 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} urging him to come home. With the announcement, Harry's flight{{sic}} became public and the story circulated in the newspapers. The couple kept in contact indirectly through their publishers and friends. On 2{{nbsp}}August, Martinsson wrote to Harry that she was going to commit suicide and that the manuscript was going to follow her to the grave. She had buried the manuscript in the woods. The letter reached Harry while he worked his passage aboard a ship to Rottedam. A week later, he was back home in Johannesdal and he, Martinson and one of their sons dug up the manuscript.{{sfn|Söderblom|1994|pp=84–85}}

In August 1934, the couple were invited to the first [[Union of Soviet Writers|All Union Congress of Soviet Writers]] in [[Moscow]] as part of the Swedish delegation. Gorky became the first chairman of the congress during which the new doctrine of [[Socialist realism]] was formed.&lt;ref name="kirjasto" group=w /&gt; Martinson became fascinated by the communist society, while Harry was appalled by [[Stalin's cult of personality]].{{sfn|Andersson|2003|p=137}}{{sfn|Söderblom|1994|p=75}}

In the autumn of 1935, the tension between Martinson and Harry seemed to have disappeared. She was working on ''Mor gifter sig''.{{sfn|Engman|2004|p=214}} In 1937, she decided to leave the [[Albert Bonniers förlag|Bonnier publishing company]]. Instead she joined the Tidens publisher which was owned by the Swedish social democratic party. Martinson decided to leave because she had been having disagreements with Tor Bonnier since 1934. He was one of the Bonnier-founder's two grandsons who jointly ran the company at the time. Her choice of Tidens was also partly due to political reasons. Starting with a collection of poems called ''Motsols'' ("''Counterclockwise''"), Martinson's works were now published by Tidens. She had been working on ''Motsols'' for ten years. It consisted of poems about politics, love and nature.{{sfn|Engman|2004|p=217}}

During the 1930s, Martinson experienced severe stomach pains. Despite several diagnoses made by different doctors, no remedy could be found and the pain continued. In June 1937, she was hospitalized at the [[Södertälje]] hospital where it was discovered that [[Shotgun shell#Buckshot|buckshots]] had accumulated in her [[Appendix (anatomy)|appendix]]. She had an operation on 16{{nbsp}}June and during her stay at the hospital, she and Harry kept in contact through letters. Harry's were love letters, while Martinson still found it difficult to trust him after his extramarital affairs. Her letters were not as affectionate as his and their relationship was crumbling.{{sfn|Engman|2004|pp=219–221}} On 8{{nbsp}}February 1939, Harry experienced [[Knee effusion|pain in one of his knees]] and was hospitalized. He stayed in the hospital during spring and was discharged on 13{{nbsp}}June, after which he went to Stockholm and stayed with friends. He broke contact with Martinson and after [[Midsummer#Sweden|Midsummer]] 1939, he filed for divorce and never returned to her or Johannesdal.{{sfn|Söderblom|1994|p=158}}{{sfn|Engman|2004|pp=228–230}} They were granted [[Decree nisi|legal separation]] on 4{{nbsp}}March 1940,{{sfn|Engman|2004|p=236}} and divorced in 1941.{{sfn|Söderblom|1994|p=367}} By then Harry was already engaged to his second wife Ingrid Lagercrantz.{{sfn|Engman|2004|p=236}} They were married until Harry committed suicide on 11{{nbsp}}February 1978 at the [[Karolinska University Hospital]] in Stockholm by cutting his stomach open with a pair of scissors in what has been described as a "[[Seppuku|hara-kiri]]-like manner", due to a depression following a controversy regarding the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]] he received in 1974.&lt;ref name=AH group=w&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hansson|first1=Anita|title=Martinson begick harakiri|trans-title=Martinson committed hara-kiri|url=http://wwwc.aftonbladet.se/nyheter/0008/31/harakiri.html|website=wwwc.aftonbladet.se|date=31 August 2000|publisher=[[Aftonbladet]]|accessdate=29 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Gyllensten|2000}}

The marriage between Martinson and Harry is recounted in the [[memoir]]s ''Tröskeln'' ("''The Threshold''") (1982) by their friend Swedish writer [[Ivar Lo-Johansson]].{{sfn|Lo-Johansson|1982}} She also relied on Lo-Johansson to deliver messages to Harry when he was out on his wanderings and his whereabouts were unknown to her.&lt;ref name="kirjasto" group=w /&gt;

== Later life and death ==
[[File:Moa Martinson 1956.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Moa Martinson in 1956]]
Over six years Martinson had published eight books and had gained most critics' respect. In September 1939, [[World War II]] broke out, which she saw as the biggest threat to the working class. In her opinion, the non-socialist ruling countries were sending out workers to fight for values they did not share. When it came to [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Soviet participation]] in the war, Martinson had a different opinion and believed that Russian workers were defending their revolution.{{sfn|Engman|2004|pp=231–236}}

In order to make more money and avoid loneliness Martinson entered a new area, the film industry. She had help from her friend [[Naima Wifstrand]], who was an actress. Martinson wrote a lengthy [[screenplay]] that she sent to director [[Per Lindberg]], who became interested. She proposed that they would contact [[AB Svensk Filmindustri]] (SF). However, Martinson's ambitions were too big and when she demanded an advance and an answer straight away, SF showed no interest.{{sfn|Engman|2004|p=236}}

In the autumn of 1942, she met Karl Gunnarsson, whom she had first encountered in 1910 when she worked as a pantry chef at the Elfkarleö Hotel, south of [[Gävle]]. Gunnarsson was a writer too and the meeting with him reminded Martinson of her youth during the 1910s and the move to Johannesdal. Her memories were given shape in a love novel called ''Den osynlige älskaren'' ("''The Invisible Lover''").{{sfn|Engman|2004|p=248}}

During the 1940s, Martinson became known in Sweden as "the Mother of the People". Her books were reaching a wide audience and she now had readers who could identify with the environment she was portraying, instead of people being shocked by her naturalistic scenes. She wrote diligently and had causerie and debate articles published in many daily and weekly papers. She was also frequently hired to give lectures and traveled the country on different tours. In 1944, she made her radio debut. Because of her strong personality, what she said and did caused attention, and she became a role model for many women in Sweden and most of all for women in the working class.{{sfn|Engman|2004|p=254}}

In November 1954, Martinson's mother Kristina Swartz died at the age of 83. Their relationship had been very strong, and Martinson's mother had been a big influence and inspiration for her work.{{sfn|Engman|2004|p=281}} In ''My Mother Gets Married'', she characterized Swartz as her best and most trusted friend.&lt;ref name="kirjasto" group=w /&gt; At that time, Martinson's literary reputation was low as it had decreased throughout the years. When her health became worse in the 60s, she stopped writing. However, despite her low reputation as a writer, Martinson still meant a lot to working class women. Even though her health was deteriorating, she still enjoyed debating and never stopped expressing her feelings.{{sfn|Engman|2004|pp=280–283}}

On 5{{nbsp}}August 1964, Martinson died at 73 years of age in [[Sorunda]], [[Strängnäs]].&lt;ref name=nynas group=w&gt;{{cite web|title=Johannesdal – Moas torp|trans-title="Johannesdal – Moa's torp|url=http://www.nynashamn.se/Uppleva-se-och-gora/Kultur-och-sevardheter/Fornlamningar-och-kulturmiljoer/Moa-Martinson.html|website=www.nynashamn.se|publisher=[[Nynäshamn Municipality]]|accessdate=17 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is buried at Sorunda Church.&lt;ref name=visitnynas group=w/&gt;

== Legacy ==
During the 1970s, Martinson became a role model for female writers during the [[Feminism|femimist]] movement in the [[Nordic countries]].&lt;ref name="kirjasto" group=w /&gt; Earlier, during the 1960s, she had been labeled "the cheerful chronicler of misery" by Swedish author Erik Hjalmar Linder.{{sfn|Tigerstedt|Linder|1965}}

{{quote|"Paradoxically enough, I am mostly indignant not because I was denied the possibility to get a university education, but because I landed right in the same anonymous hell as my mother. Maybe it was even harder for me, for I was fully conscious that it was hell. I was clear about the injustice against all of us, and powerless."|From foreword for ''My Mother Gets Married''{{sfn|Martinson|1988}}}}

In 1989, a literary award named after Martinson was instituted by the [[Arbetarnas bildningsförbund|Workers' Educational Association]] (''Arbetarnas bildningsförbund'', ABF) and the Moa Martinson Society. The [[Arbetarnas bildningsförbund#Moa Award|Moa Award]] (''Moa-priset'') is an annual prize awarded to a person who writes in the spirit of Martinson.&lt;ref group=w&gt;{{cite web|title=Kristina Sandberg vinner Moa-priset|trans-title=Kristina Sandberg wins the Moa Award|date=9 January 2015|url=http://www.svd.se/kristina-sandberg-vinner-moa-priset|website=www.svd.se|publisher=[[Svenska Dagbladet]]|accessdate=23 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=w&gt;{{cite web|title=Förteckning över Moastipendiater|trans-title=List of Moa stipends|url=http://www.moamartinson.se/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=55:foerteckning-oever-moastipendiater&amp;catid=25:saellskapet&amp;Itemid=37|website=www.moamartinson.se|accessdate=23 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Mojibakevector.png|thumb|400px|The [[UTF-8]]-encoded [[:ja:文字化け|Japanese Wikipedia article for ''mojibake'']], as displayed if interpreted as [[Windows-1252]] encoding.]]
{{special characters}}

'''Mojibake''' ({{lang|ja|文字化け}}; {{IPA-ja|mod͡ʑibake|IPA}}) is the garbled text that is the result of text being decoded using an unintended [[character encoding]].&lt;ref name="ieee"&gt;"[https://dx.doi.org/10.1109/MSPEC.2012.6221090 Will Unicode soon be the universal code?]" ''IEEE Spectrum'', vol. 49, issue 7, p. 60 (July 2012).  ''The advantage of Unicode is that if everyone adopted it, it would eradicate the problem of '''mojibake''', Japanese for "character transformation." Mojibake is the jumble that results when characters are encoded in one system but decoded in another.''&lt;/ref&gt; The result is a systematic replacement of symbols with completely unrelated ones, often from a different [[writing system]].

This display may include the generic [[Specials (Unicode block)#Replacement character|replacement character]] � in places where the binary representation is considered invalid. A replacement can also involve multiple consecutive symbols, as viewed in one encoding, when the same binary code constitutes one symbol in the other encoding. This is either because of differing constant length encoding (as in Asian 16-bit encodings vs European 8-bit encodings), or the use of variable length encodings (notably [[UTF-8]] and [[UTF-16]]).

Failed rendering of glyphs due to either missing fonts or missing glyphs in a font is a different issue that is not to be confused with mojibake. Symptoms of this failed rendering include blocks with the [[code point]] displayed in [[hexadecimal]] or using the generic replacement character �. Importantly, these replacements are ''valid'' and are the result of correct error handling by the software.

==Etymology==
''Mojibake'' means "character transformation" in [[Japanese (language)|Japanese]]. The word is composed of {{lang|ja|文字}} (moji, {{IPA-ja|mod͡ʑi|IPA}}), "character" and {{lang|ja|化け}} (bake, {{IPA-ja|bake|IPA}}, pronounced "bah-keh"), "transform".

==Causes==
To correctly reproduce the original text that was encoded, the correspondence between the encoded data and the notion of its encoding must be preserved. As mojibake is the instance of non-compliance between these, it can be achieved by manipulating the data itself, or just relabeling it.

Mojibake is often seen with text data that have been tagged with a wrong encoding; it may not even be tagged at all, but moved between computers with different default encodings. A major source of trouble are [[communication protocol]]s that rely on settings on each computer rather than sending or storing [[metadata]] together with the data.

The differing default settings between computers are in part due to differing deployments of [[Unicode]] among [[operating system]] families, and partly the legacy encodings' specializations for different [[writing system]]s of human languages. Whereas [[Linux distribution]]s mostly switched to [[UTF-8]] in 2004,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=WINDISCHMANN |first1=Stephan |title=curl -v linux.ars (Internationalization) |url=https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2004/03/linux-20040331/ |website=Ars Technica |accessdate=5 October 2018 |language=en-us |date=31 March 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Microsoft Windows]] still uses codepages for text files that differ between languages.{{disputed inline|Windows and Unicode|date=January 2018}}

For some [[writing system]]s, an example being [[Japanese script|Japanese]], several encodings have historically been employed, causing users to see mojibake relatively often. As a Japanese example, the word ''mojibake'' "文字化け" stored as [[EUC-JP]] might be incorrectly displayed as "ﾊｸｻ&amp;#65533;ｽ､ｱ", "ﾊｸｻ嵂ｽ､ｱ" ([[Windows-31J|MS-932]]), or "ﾊｸｻ郾ｽ､ｱ" ([[Shift JIS-2004]]). The same text stored as [[UTF-8]] is displayed as "譁&amp;#65533;蟄怜喧縺&amp;#65533;" if interpreted as Shift JIS. This is further exacerbated if other locales are involved: the same UTF-8 text appears as "æ–‡å—åŒ–ã‘" in software that assumes text to be in the [[Windows-1252]] or [[ISO-8859-1]] encodings, usually labelled Western, or (for example) as "鏂囧瓧鍖栥亼" if interpreted as being in a [[GBK (character encoding)|GBK]] (Mainland China) locale.

===Underspecification===
If the encoding is not specified, it is up to the software to decide it by other means. Depending on the type of software, the typical solution is either configuration or [[charset detection]] heuristics. Both are prone to mis-prediction in not-so-uncommon scenarios.

The encoding of [[text file]]s is usually governed by the [[Operating system|OS]]-level setting, which depends on brand of operating system and possibly the user's language. Therefore, the assumed encoding is systematically wrong for files that come from a computer with a different setting, for example when transferring files between Windows and Linux. One solution is to use a [[byte order mark]], but for [[source code]] and other machine readable text, many parsers don't tolerate this. Another is storing the encoding as metadata in the file system. File systems that support [[extended file attributes]] can store this as &lt;code&gt;user.charset&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Guidelines for extended attributes|url=http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/CommonExtendedAttributes|date=2013-05-17|accessdate=2015-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; This also requires support in software that wants to take advantage of it, but does not disturb other software.

While a few encodings are easy to detect, in particular UTF-8, there are many that are hard to distinguish (see [[charset detection]]). A [[web browser]] may not be able to distinguish a page coded in [[EUC-JP]] and another in [[Shift-JIS]] if the coding scheme is not assigned explicitly using [[HTTP headers]] sent along with the documents, or using the [[HTML]] document's [[meta tag]]s that are used to substitute for missing HTTP headers if the server cannot be configured to send the proper HTTP headers; see [[character encodings in HTML]].

===Mis-specification===
Mojibake also occurs when the encoding is wrongly specified. This often happens between encodings that are similar. For example, the [[Eudora (e-mail client)|Eudora]] email client for [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] was known to send emails labelled as [[ISO-8859-1]] that were in reality [[Windows-1252]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.unicode.org/mail-arch/unicode-ml/y2001-m07/0355.html|title=Unicode mailinglist on the Eudora email client|date=2001-05-13|accessdate=2014-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Mac OS version of Eudora did not exhibit this behaviour. Windows-1252 contains extra printable characters in the [[C1 control codes|C1]] range (the most frequently seen being the typographically correct [[quotation marks]] and [[dash]]es), that were not displayed properly in software complying with the ISO standard; this especially affected software running under other operating systems such as [[Unix]].

====Human ignorance====
Of the encodings still in use, many are partially compatible with each other, with [[ASCII]] as the predominant common subset. This sets the stage for human ignorance:
* Compatibility can be a deceptive property, as the common subset of characters are unaffected by a mixup of two encodings (see [[#Problems in different writing systems|Problems in different writing systems]]).
* People think they are using ASCII, and tend to label whatever superset of ASCII they actually use as "ASCII". Maybe for simplification, but even in academic literature, the word "ASCII" can be found used as an example of something ''not'' compatible with Unicode, where evidently "ASCII" is Windows-1252 and "Unicode" is UTF-8.&lt;ref name="ieee"/&gt; Note that UTF-8 ''is'' backwards compatible with ASCII.

===Overspecification===
When there are layers of protocols, each trying to specify the encoding based on different information, the least certain information may be misleading to the recipient.
For example, consider a [[web server]] serving a static HTML file over HTTP. The character set may be communicated to the client in any number of 3 ways:
* in the HTTP header. This information can be based on server configuration (for instance, when serving a file off disk) or controlled by the application running on the server (for dynamic websites).
* in the file, as an [[Meta element|HTML meta tag]] (&lt;code&gt;http-equiv&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;charset&lt;/code&gt;) or the &lt;code&gt;encoding&lt;/code&gt; attribute of an [[XML]] declaration. This is the encoding that the author meant to save the particular file in.
* in the file, as a [[byte order mark]]. This is the encoding that the author's editor actually saved it in. Unless an accidental encoding conversion has happened (by opening it in one encoding and saving it in another), this will be correct. It is, however, only available in [[Unicode]] encodings such as UTF-8 or UTF-16.

===Lack of hardware/software support===
Much older hardware is typically designed to support only one character set and the character set typically cannot be altered. The character table contained within the display firmware will be localized to have characters for the country the device is to be sold in, and typically the table differs from country to country. As such, these systems will potentially display mojibake when loading text generated on a system from a different country. Likewise, many early operating systems do not support multiple encoding formats and thus will end up displaying mojibake if made to display non-standard text- early versions of [[Microsoft Windows]] and [[Palm OS]] for example, are localized on a per-country basis and will only support encoding standards relevant to the country the localized version will be sold in, and will display mojibake if a file containing a text in a different encoding format from the version that the OS is designed to support is opened.

==Resolutions==

Applications using [[UTF-8]] as a default encoding may achieve a greater degree of interoperability because of its widespread use and backward compatibility with [[US-ASCII]]. UTF-8 also has the ability to be directly recognised by a simple algorithm, so that well written software should be able to avoid mixing UTF-8 up with other encodings.

The difficulty of resolving an instance of mojibake varies depending on the application within which it occurs and the causes of it. Two of the most common applications in which mojibake may occur are [[web browser]]s and [[word processor]]s. Modern browsers and word processors often support a wide array of character encodings. Browsers often allow a user to change their [[Browser engine|rendering engine's]] encoding setting on the fly, while word processors allow the user to select the appropriate encoding when opening a file. It may take some [[trial and error]] for users to find the correct encoding.

The problem gets more complicated when it occurs in an application that normally does not support a wide range of character encoding, such as in a non-Unicode computer game. In this case, the user must change the operating system's encoding settings to match that of the game. However, changing the system-wide encoding settings can also cause Mojibake in pre-existing applications. In [[Windows XP]] or later, a user also has the option to use [[Microsoft AppLocale]], an application that allows the changing of per-application locale settings. Even so, changing the operating system encoding settings is not possible on earlier operating systems such as [[Windows 98]]; to resolve this issue on earlier operating systems, a user would have to use third party font rendering applications.

==Problems in different writing systems==

===English===
Mojibake in English texts generally occurs in punctuation, such as [[em dash]]es (&amp;mdash;), [[en dash]]es (&amp;ndash;), and [[curly quote]]s (“,”,‘,’), but rarely in character text, since most encodings agree with [[ASCII]] on the encoding of the [[English alphabet]]. For example, the [[pound sign]] "£" will appear as "Â£" if it was encoded by the sender as [[UTF-8]] but interpreted by the recipient as [[CP1252]] or [[ISO 8859-1]]. If iterated, this can lead to "Ã‚Â£", "Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â£", "ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â£", etc.

Some computers did, in older eras, have vendor-specific encodings which caused mismatch also for English text.
[[Commodore International|Commodore]] brand [[8-bit]] computers used [[PETSCII]] encoding, particularly notable for ''inverting'' the upper and lower case compared to standard [[ASCII]]. PETSCII printers worked fine on other computers of the era, but flipped the case of all letters. IBM mainframes use the [[EBCDIC]] encoding which does not match ASCII at all.

===Central and Eastern European===
Users of [[Central Europe|Central]] and [[Eastern Europe]]an languages can also be affected. Because most computers were not connected to any network during the mid- to late-1980s, there were different character encodings for every language with [[diacritic]]al characters (see [[ISO/IEC 8859]] and [[KOI-8]]), often also varying by operating system.

[[File:Moya Strana Mojibake.jpg|thumb|Mojibake caused by a song title in Cyrillic ([[Moya Strana, Moya Bălgaria|Моя Страна]]) on a car audio system]]

===Russian and other Cyrillic alphabets {{anchor|Russian and other Cyrillic-based scripts}}===&lt;!-- A #-link leads to here from #Countries of the former Yugoslavia --&gt;
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Letter to Russia with krokozyabry.jpg|thumb|right|Example of Mojibake corrected upon identification.]] --&gt;
Mojibake may be colloquially called ''krakozyabry'' (кракозя́бры, [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]]:{{IPA|krɐkɐˈzʲæbrɪ&amp;#x308;}}) in [[Russian language|Russian]], which was and remains complicated by several systems for encoding [[Cyrillic]].&lt;ref&gt;p. 141, ''Control + Alt + Delete: A Dictionary of Cyberslang'', Jonathon Keats, Globe Pequot, 2007, {{ISBN|1-59921-039-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Soviet Union]] and early [[Russian Federation]] developed [[KOI character encodings|KOI encodings]] (Kod Obmena Informatsiey, Код Обмена Информацией, which translates to "Code for Information Exchange").  This began with Cyrillic-only 7-bit [[KOI7]], based on [[ASCII]] but with Latin and some other characters replaced with Cyrillic letters.  Then came 8-bit [[KOI8]] encoding that is an [[extended ASCII|ASCII extension]] which encodes Cyrillic letters only with high-bit set octets corresponding to 7-bit codes from KOI7. It is for this reason that KOI8 text, even Russian, remains partially readable after stripping the eighth bit, which was considered as a major advantage in the age of [[8BITMIME]]-unaware email systems. For example, words "Школа русского языка" ''shkola russkogo yazyka'', encoded in KOI8 and then passed through the high bit stripping process, end up rendered as "[KOLA RUSSKOGO qZYKA". Eventually KOI8 gained different flavors for Russian/Bulgarian ([[KOI8-R]]), Ukrainian ([[KOI8-U]]), [[Belarusian alphabet|Belarusian]] (KOI8-RU) and even [[Tajik Cyrillic alphabet|Tajik]] (KOI8-T).

Meanwhile, in the West, [[Code page 866]] supported [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]] and [[Belarusian language|Belarusian]] as well as Russian/[[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]] in [[MS-DOS]].  For [[Microsoft Windows]], [[Windows-1251|Code Page 1251]] added support for [[Serbian Cyrillic alphabet|Serbian]] and [[Cyrillic alphabet variants#Slavic languages|other Slavic variants of Cyrillic]].

Most recently, the [[Cyrillic Unicode block|Unicode]] encoding includes [[code point]]s for practically all the characters of all the world's languages, including all Cyrillic characters.

Before Unicode, it was necessary to match text encoding with a font using the same encoding system. Failure to do this produced unreadable [[gibberish]] whose specific appearance varied depending on the exact combination of text encoding and font encoding.  For example, attempting to view non-Unicode Cyrillic text using a font that is limited to the Latin alphabet, or using the default ("Western") encoding, typically results in text that consists almost entirely of vowels with diacritical marks. (KOI8 "Библиотека" (''biblioteka'', library) becomes "âÉÂÌÉÏÔÅËÁ".) Using Windows codepage 1251 to view text in KOI8 or vice versa results in garbled text that consists mostly of capital letters (KOI8 and codepage 1251 share the same ASCII region, but KOI8 has uppercase letters in the region where codepage 1251 has lowercase, and vice versa). In general, Cyrillic gibberish is symptomatic of using the wrong Cyrillic font. During the early years of the Russian sector of the World Wide Web, both KOI8 and codepage 1251 were common. As of 2017, one can still encounter HTML pages in codepage 1251 and, rarely, KOI8 encodings, as well as Unicode. (An estimated 1.7% of all web pages worldwide – all languages included – are encoded in codepage 1251.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://w3techs.com/technologies/details/en-windows1251/all/all|title=Usage of Windows-1251 for websites}}&lt;/ref&gt;)  Though the HTML standard includes the ability to specify the encoding for any given web page in its source,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.w3schools.com/TAGs/att_meta_charset.asp|title=Declaring character encodings in HTML}}&lt;/ref&gt; this is sometimes neglected, forcing the user to switch encodings in the browser manually.

In [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]], mojibake is often called ''majmunica'' (маймуница), meaning "monkey's [alphabet]". In [[Serbian language|Serbian]], it is called ''đubre'' (ђубре), meaning "[[waste|trash]]". Unlike the former USSR, South Slavs never used something like KOI8, and Code Page 1251 was the dominant Cyrillic encoding there before Unicode. Therefore, these languages experienced fewer encoding incompatibility troubles than Russian. In the 1980s, Bulgarian computers used their own [[MIK Code page|MIK encoding]], which is superficially similar to (although incompatible with) CP866.

===Polish===
Prior to the creation of [[ISO 8859-2]] in 1987, users of various computing platforms used their own [[Polish code pages|character encodings]] such as [[AmigaPL]] on Amiga, Atari Club on Atari ST and Masovia, IBM [[CP852]], [[Mazovia encoding|Mazovia]] and [[Windows-1250|Windows CP1250]] on IBM PCs. Polish companies selling early [[DOS]] computers created their own mutually-incompatible ways to encode Polish characters and simply reprogrammed the [[EPROM]]s of the video cards (typically [[Color Graphics Adapter|CGA]], [[Enhanced Graphics Adapter|EGA]], or [[Hercules Graphics Card|Hercules]]) to provide [[hardware code page]]s with the needed glyphs for Polish—arbitrarily located without reference to where other computer sellers had placed them.

The situation began to improve when, after pressure from academic and user groups, [[ISO 8859-2]] succeeded as the "Internet standard" with limited support of the dominant vendors' software (today largely replaced by Unicode). With the numerous problems caused by the variety of encodings, even today some users tend to refer to Polish diacritical characters as ''krzaczki'' ([kshach-kih], lit. "little shrubs").

===Yugoslav languages===
[[Slovene language|Slovenian]], [[Croatian language|Croatian]], [[Bosnian language|Bosnian]], [[Serbian language|Serbian]], the variants of the Yugoslav [[Serbo-Croatian language]], add to the basic Latin alphabet the letters š, đ, č, ć, ž, and their capital counterparts Š, Đ, Č, Ć, Ž (only č/Č, š/Š and ž/Ž in Slovenian; officially, although others are used when needed, mostly in foreign names, as well). All of these letters are defined in [[ISO/IEC 8859-2|Latin-2]] and [[Windows-1250]], while only some (š, Š, ž, Ž, Đ) exist in the usual OS-default [[Windows-1252]], and are there because of some other languages.

Although Mojibake can occur with any of these characters, the letters that are not included in Windows-1252 are much more prone to errors. Thus, even nowadays, "šđčćž ŠĐČĆŽ" is often displayed as "šðèæž ŠÐÈÆŽ", although ð, è, æ, È, Æ are never used in Slavic languages.

When confined to basic ASCII (most user names, for example), common replacements are: š→s, đ→dj, č→c, ć→cj, ž→z (capital forms analogously, with Đ→Dj or Đ→DJ depending on word case). All of these replacements introduce ambiguities, so reconstructing the original from such a form is usually done manually if required.

The [[Windows-1252]] encoding is important because the English versions of the Windows operating system are most widespread, not localized ones.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} The reasons for this include a relatively small and fragmented market, increasing the price of high quality localization, a high degree of software piracy (in turn caused by high price of software compared to income), which discourages localization efforts, and people preferring English versions of Windows and other software .{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

The drive to [[Differences between standard Bosnian, Croatian and Serbian|differentiate]] Croatian from Serbian, Bosnian from Croatian and Serbian, and now even [[Montenegrin alphabet|Montenegrin]] from the other three creates many problems. There are many different localizations, using different standards and of different quality. There are no common translations for the vast amount of computer terminology originating in English. In the end, people use adopted English words ("kompjuter" for "computer", "kompajlirati" for "compile," etc.), and if they are unaccustomed to the translated terms may not understand what some option in a menu is supposed to do based on the translated phrase. Therefore, people who understand English, as well as those who are accustomed to English terminology (who are most, because English terminology is also mostly taught in schools because of these problems) regularly choose the original English versions of non-specialist software.

When Cyrillic script is used (for [[Macedonian language|Macedonian]] and partially [[Serbian language|Serbian]]), the problem is similar to [[#Russian and other Cyrillic-based scripts|other Cyrillic-based scripts]].

Newer versions of English Windows allow the ANSI codepage to be changed (older versions require special English versions with this support), but this setting can be and often was incorrectly set. For example, Windows 98/Me can be set to most non-right-to-left [[SBCS|single-byte]] codepages including 1250, but only at install time.

===Hungarian===
[[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] is another affected language, which uses the 26 basic English characters, plus the accented forms á, é, í, ó, ú, ö, ü (all present in the Latin-1 character set), plus the two characters [[ő]] and [[ű]], which are not in Latin-1. These two characters can be correctly encoded in Latin-2, Windows-1250 and Unicode. Before Unicode became common in e-mail clients, e-mails containing Hungarian text often had the letters ő and ű corrupted, sometimes to the point of unrecognizability. It is common to respond to an e-mail rendered unreadable (see examples below) by character mangling (referred to as "betűszemét", meaning "garbage lettering") with the phrase "Árvíztűrő tükörfúrógép", a nonsense phrase (literally "Flood-resistant mirror-drilling machine") containing all accented characters used in Hungarian.

===Other Western European languages===
The alphabets of the [[North Germanic languages]], [[Catalan language|Catalan]], [[Finnish language|Finnish]], [[German language|German]], [[French language|French]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] and [[Spanish language|Spanish]] are all extensions of the [[Latin alphabet]]. The additional characters are typically the ones that become corrupted, making texts only mildly unreadable with mojibake:
*[[å]], [[ä]] and [[ö]] in [[Finnish language|Finnish]] and [[Swedish language|Swedish]]
*à, ç, è, é, ï, í, ò, ó, ú, ü in [[Catalan language|Catalan]]
*å, [[æ]] and [[ø]] in [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] and [[Danish language|Danish]]
*á, é, ó, ý, è, ë, ï in [[Dutch language|Dutch]]
*ä, ö, [[ü]], and [[ß]] in [[German language|German]]
*á, [[ð]], [[í]], [[ó]], [[ú]], [[ý]], æ and ø in [[Faroese language|Faroese]]
*á, ð, [[é]], í, ó, ú, ý, [[þ]], æ and ö in [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]]
*à, â, ç, è, é, ë, ê, ï, î, ö, ô, ù, û, ÿ, æ, œ in [[French language|French]]
*à, è, é, ì, ò, ù in [[Italian language|Italian]]
*á, é, í, ñ, ó, ú, ï, ü, [[Inverted question and exclamation marks|¡, ¿]] in [[Spanish language|Spanish]]
*à, á, â, ã, ç, é, ê, í, ó, ô, õ, ú in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] (ü no longer used)
*á, é, í, ó, ú in [[Irish language|Irish]]
*£ in [[British English]]
... and their uppercase counterparts, if applicable.

These are languages for which the [[iso-8859-1]] character set (also known as ''Latin 1'' or ''Western'') has been in use. However, iso-8859-1 has been obsoleted by two competing standards, the backward compatible [[windows-1252]], and the slightly altered [[iso-8859-15]]. Both add the [[Euro sign]] € and the French œ, but otherwise any confusion of these three character sets does not create mojibake in these languages. Furthermore, it is always safe to interpret iso-8859-1 as windows-1252, and fairly safe to interpret it as iso-8859-15, in particular with respect to the Euro sign, which replaces the rarely used [[Currency sign (typography)|currency sign]] (¤). However, with the advent of [[UTF-8]], mojibake has become more common in certain scenarios, e.g. exchange of text files between [[UNIX]] and [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] computers, due to UTF-8's incompatibility with Latin-1 and Windows-1252. But UTF-8 has the ability to be directly recognised by a simple algorithm, so that well written software should be able to avoid mixing UTF-8 up with other encodings, so this was most common when many had software not supporting UTF-8. Most of these languages were supported by MS-DOS default CP437 and other machine default encodings, except ASCII, so problems when buying an operating system version were less common. Windows and MS-DOS are not compatible however.

In Swedish, Norwegian, Danish and German, vowels are rarely repeated, and it is usually obvious when one character gets corrupted, e.g. the second letter in "kÃ⁠¤rlek" (''{{lang|sv|kärlek}}'', "love"). This way, even though the reader has to guess between å, ä and ö, almost all texts remain legible. Finnish text, on the other hand, does feature repeating vowels in words like ''{{lang|fi|hääyö}}'' ("wedding night") which can sometimes render text very hard to read (e.g. ''{{lang|fi|hääyö}}'' appears as "hÃ⁠¤Ã⁠¤yÃ⁠¶"). Icelandic and Faroese have ten and eight possibly confounding characters, respectively, which thus can make it more difficult to guess corrupted characters; Icelandic words like ''{{lang|is|þjóðlöð}}'' ("outstanding hospitality") become almost entirely unintelligible when rendered as "Ã¾jÃ³Ã°lÃ¶Ã°".

In German, ''{{lang|de|Buchstabensalat}}'' ("letter salad") is a common term for this phenomenon, and in Spanish, ''{{lang|es|deformación}}'' (literally deformation).

Some users transliterate their writing when using a computer, either by omitting the problematic diacritics, or by using digraph replacements (å → aa, ä/æ → ae, ö/ø → oe, ü → ue etc.).  Thus, an author might write "ueber" instead of "über", which is standard practice in German when [[umlaut (diacritic)|umlaut]]s are not available. The latter practice seems to be better tolerated in the German language sphere than in the [[Nordic countries]].  For example, in Norwegian, digraphs are associated with archaic Danish, and may be used jokingly.  However, digraphs are useful in communication with other parts of the world. As an example, the Norwegian football player [[Ole Gunnar Solskjær]] had his name spelled "SOLSKJAER" on his back when he played for [[Manchester United]].

An artifact of [[UTF-8]] misinterpreted as [[ISO-8859-1]], "Ring meg nÃ¥" ("{{lang|no|Ring meg nå}}"), was seen in an SMS scam raging in Norway in June 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=sms-scam|url=http://tv2.no/2014/06/18/nyheter/5718240|date=June 18, 2014|accessdate=June 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Caucasian languages===
The writing systems of certain [[languages of the Caucasus]] region, including the scripts of [[Georgian language|Georgian]] and [[Armenian language|Armenian]], may produce mojibake. This problem is particularly acute in the case of [[ArmSCII]] or ARMSCII, a set of obsolete character encodings for the Armenian alphabet which have been superseded by Unicode standards. ArmSCII is not widely used because of a lack of support in the computer industry. For example, [[Microsoft Windows]] does not support it.

===Asian encodings===
Another type of mojibake occurs when text is erroneously parsed in a multi-byte encoding, such as one of the encodings for [[East Asian languages]]. With this kind of mojibake more than one (typically two) characters are corrupted at once, e.g. "k舐lek" (''kärlek'') in Swedish, where "är" is parsed as "舐". Compared to the above mojibake, this is harder to read, since letters unrelated to the problematic å, ä or ö are missing, and is especially problematic for short words starting with å, ä or ö such as "än" (which becomes "舅"). Since two letters are combined, the mojibake also seems more random (over 50 variants compared to the normal three, not counting the rarer capitals). In some rare cases, an entire text string which happens to include a pattern of particular word lengths, such as the sentence "[[Bush hid the facts]]", may be misinterpreted.

====Japanese====
{{Main|Japanese language and computers}}
In [[Japanese language|Japanese]], the phenomenon is, as mentioned, called {{nihongo|''mojibake''|文字化け}}. It is a particular problem in Japan due to the numerous different encodings that exist for Japanese text. Alongside Unicode encodings like UTF-8 and UTF-16, there are other standard encodings, such as [[Shift-JIS]] (Windows machines) and [[EUC-JP]] (UNIX systems). Mojibake, as well as being encountered by Japanese users, is also often encountered by non-Japanese when attempting to run software written for the Japanese market.

====Chinese====
In [[Chinese language|Chinese]], the same phenomenon is called ''Luàn mǎ'' ([[Pinyin]], [[Simplified Chinese]] {{lang|zh-Hans|乱码}}, [[Traditional Chinese]] {{lang|zh-Hant|亂碼}}, meaning chaotic code), and can occur when computerised text is encoded in one [[Chinese character encoding]] but is displayed using the wrong encoding.  When this occurs, it is often possible to fix the issue by switching the character encoding without loss of data.  The situation is complicated because of the existence of several Chinese character encoding systems in use, the most common ones being: [[Unicode]], [[Big5]], and [[Guobiao code|Guobiao]] (with several backward compatible versions), and the possibility of Chinese characters being encoded using Japanese encoding.

It is easy to identify the original encoding when ''luanma'' occurs in Guobiao encodings:

An additional problem is caused when encodings are missing characters, which is common with rare or antiquated characters that are still used in personal or place names. Examples of this are [[Taiwan]]ese politicians [[Wang Chien-shien]] ({{zh|c=王建煊|p=Wáng Jiànxuān|links=no}})'s "煊", [[Yu Shyi-kun]] ({{zh|t=游錫堃|s=游锡堃|p=Yóu Xíkūn|links=no}})'s "堃" and singer [[David Tao]] ({{zh|t=陶喆|p=Táo Zhé|links=no}})'s "喆" missing in [[Big5]], ex-PRC Premier [[Zhu Rongji]] ({{zh|c=朱镕基|p=Zhū Róngjī|links=no}})'s "镕" missing in [[GB2312]], [[copyright symbol|copyright symbol "©"]] missing in [[GBK (character encoding)|GBK]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.microsoft.com/typography/unicode/936.txt |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20021001194325/http://www.microsoft.com/typography/unicode/936.txt |title=PRC GBK (XGB) |archivedate=2002-10-01 |deadurl=yes}} Conversion map between [[Code page 936 (Microsoft Windows)|Code page 936]] and Unicode. Need manually selecting [[GB18030]] or GBK in browser to view it correctly.&lt;/ref&gt;

Newspapers have dealt with this problem in various ways, including using software to combine two existing, similar characters; using a picture of the personality; or simply substituting a homophone for the rare character in the hope that the reader would be able to make the correct inference.

===Indic text===
A similar effect can occur in [[Brahmic scripts|Brahmic or Indic scripts]] of [[South Asia]], used in such [[Indo-Aryan languages|Indo-Aryan or Indic languages]] as [[Hindustani language|Hindustani]] (Hindi-Urdu), [[Bengali language|Bengali]], [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]], [[Marathi language|Marathi]], and others, even if the character set employed is properly recognized by the application.  This is because, in many Indic scripts, the rules by which individual letter symbols combine to create symbols for syllables may not be properly understood by a computer missing the appropriate software, even if the glyphs for the individual letter forms are available.

A particularly notable example of this is the old [[Logo of Wikipedia|Wikipedia logo]], which attempts to show the character analogous to "wi" (the first syllable of "Wikipedia") on each of many puzzle pieces.  The puzzle piece meant to bear the [[Devanagari]] character for "wi" instead used to display the "wa" character followed by an unpaired "i" [[diacritic|modifier]] vowel, easily recognizable as mojibake generated by a computer not configured to display Indic text.&lt;ref name="NYTimes"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Some Errors Defy Fixes: A Typo in Wikipedia’s Logo Fractures the Sanskrit|last=Cohen|first=Noam|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/25/technology/25wikipedia.html?_r=2&amp;oref=slogin|date=June 25, 2007|accessdate=July 17, 2009|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; The logo as redesigned {{as of|2010|05|lc=y|url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logo_of_Wikipedia#Current_logo}} has fixed these errors.

The idea of Plain Text requires the operating system to provide a font to display Unicode codes. This font is different from OS to OS for Singhala and it makes orthographically incorrect glyphs for some letters (syllables) across all operating systems. For instance, the 'reph', the short form for 'r' is a diacritic that normally goes on top of a plain letter. However, it is wrong to go on top of some letters like 'ya' or 'la' but it happens in all operating systems. This appears to be a fault of internal programming of the fonts. In Macintosh / iPhone, the muurdhaja l (dark l) and 'u' combination and its long form both yield wrong shapes.

Some Indic and Indic-derived scripts, most notably [[Lao script|Lao]], were not officially supported by [[Windows XP]] until the release of [[Windows Vista|Vista]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms776260(VS.85).aspx |title=Content Moved (Windows) |publisher=Msdn.microsoft.com |date= |accessdate=2014-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, various sites have made free-to-download fonts.

===African languages===
In certain [[writing systems of Africa]], unencoded text is unreadable. Texts that may produce mojibake include those from the [[Horn of Africa]] such as the [[Ge'ez script]] in [[Ethiopia]] and [[Eritrea]], used for [[Amharic]], [[Tigre language|Tigre]], and other languages, and the [[Somali language]], which employs the [[Osmanya alphabet]]. In [[Southern Africa]], the [[Mwangwego alphabet]] is used to write languages of [[Malawi]] and the [[Mandombe alphabet]] was created for the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]], but these are not generally supported. Various other writing systems native to [[West Africa]] present similar problems, such as the [[N'Ko alphabet]], used for [[Manding languages]] in [[Guinea]], and the [[Vai syllabary]], used in [[Liberia]].

===Arabic===
Another affected language is [[Arabic language|Arabic]] (see [[#Example|below]]). The text becomes unreadable when the encodings do not match.

The examples in this article do not have UTF-8 as browser setting, because UTF-8 is easily recognisable, so if a browser supports UTF-8 it should recognise it automatically, and not try to interpret something else as UTF-8.

'''Moniro Ravanipor''' (1952, [[Bushehr]] &amp;ndash; Present) Moniro Ravanipour is an internationally acclaimed innovative writer who is the author of ten titles published in Iran, including two collections of short fiction, Kanizu and Satan’s Stones, and the novels The Drowned, Heart of Steel,  and Gypsy by Fire.  Her tales, described as “reminiscent in their fantastic blend of realism, myth, and superstition of writers like Rulfo, Garcia Marquez, even Tutuola,” frequently take as their setting the small, remote village in southern Iran where she was born. Nahid Mozaffari, editor of Strange Times, My Dear:  The [[International PEN]] Anthology of Contemporary Iranian Literature, writes that Ravanipour “has been successful in the treatment of the complex subjects of tradition and modernity, juxtaposing elements of both, and exposing them in all their contradictions without idealizing either.”  Ms. Ravanipour was among seventeen activists to face trial in Iran for their participation in the 2000 Berlin Conference, accused of taking part in anti-Iran propaganda. Copies of her current work were recently stripped from bookstore shelves in Iran in a countrywide police action.  She is a former [[Brown University]] International Writers Project Fellow.

==Early life==
Moniro Ravanipour was born on 1952, in [[Bushehr]], South of [[Iran]].  Lived in [[Bushehr]] till she was 17, and moved to [[Shiraz]] for Pahlavi Private High school. 
Joined  Shiraz Pahlavi University in 1972 and studied Chemistry, and then changed major and took a degree in Psychology.
She started theatre  in [[Bushehr]] and joined the Theater and Literary Society of [[Bushehr]].

==Acting and Theatre Experience==
Moniro joined a theatre group in [[Bushehr]] called The Theatre and Literary Society of [[Bushehr]]. In 1967 Moniro acted in Mother, A play by [[Manouchehr Atashi]]. She then continued to act and participated in the production of several plays in [[Shiraz]]. Moniro worked with a group of college students for a play called Abazar Ghafari which was banned later. In 1975 she joined Shiraz Theatre Group for producing a play named Moalem, by Shapour Jowrkesh, and in 1976 participated in Tous Theatre Festival, and worked with Shapour Jowrkesh again, for a play named Khoubchehr.

==Post Revolution==
In early post revolution years she was involved in political activities and was banned from studying. During these years, her brother was executed, all her sister were banned from education in elementary and high school,  one of her sisters and her husband were sentenced to death penalty and escaped [[Iran]], one of her brothers-in-law got arrested  several times. For a decade, she couldn't have a stable place of residence due to the mentioned situation, and she moved from one place to another.  She wrote her first short story collection in 1977 named "The Sparrow and Mr. President" which was immediately banned from publishing and collected from shelves. After their house was attacked and pillaged in [[Bushehr]], her family moved to [[Shiraz]], and then Moniro moved to [[Tehran]] and using a fake name, worked as a worker in Daroupakhsh Factory. After her true identity was revealed using another fake name she worked for another six months in Amidi Factory. Later she worked the grave yard shift nurse in a private hospital, again using a fake name. In 1983 Moniro went back to [[Shiraz]] to visit her parents, and she got arrested on the street, when the regime was doing the random arrest of the citizens. It was during the terrible prison days that she decided to become a writer of big fame and success when she is free again, so she would not get killed and forgotten like many others were.

==Writing career==
Moniro started writing again from 1965, and wrote children's books and screen plays. 
A year after [[Iran-Iraq War]] she went to the City [[Khanaqin]] boundaries, for writing a novel about war using the identity of a Martyr's mother. 
After 1988 Moniro published her works using her real name and in 1994 for the first time she was invited the Women's studies Organization of [[Vienna]]. Later she was invited for speeches to 21 countries, and then she was invited by: Khaneh Farhanghaye Jahan, [[Goethe-Institut]], Literary Center of [[Gumusluk]], [[Bodrum]], [[Gothenburg]] expo in Sweden, [[Heinrich Böll Foundation]], in Germany, France, U.S., and ...

==Style==
She is famous for using magic realism, but the truth is that she uses the bitter reality she found in the happenings and real life in her homeland. Despite the bold use of surrealism and magical realism, she uses realism too. The settings of her stories are not just the rural world, but her work pictures life and culture in the urban life as well.
In 2006 she moved to the U.S. getting a scholarship in [[Brown university]]  and then at [[UNLV]]'s Black Mountain Institute's City of Asylum as a visiting author for three years. 
During her stay in the U.S. she has gone to [[Sacramento]], [[Pittsburgh]], [[San Francisco]], [[Providence, Rhode Island|Providence]], for lectures and speeches. Her short stories have been translated into: French, German, Swedish, Turkish, English, Arabic, Kurdish, Chinese,...

'''Nirupama Borgohain''' (née Tamuli; {{lang-as| নিৰূপমা বৰগোহাঞি}}; 1932&amp;ndash; ) is an Indian journalist and novelist in the [[Assamese language]]. She is a [[Sahitya Akademi]] award winner, best known for her novel ''Abhiyatri''. In the year 2015 she decided to return her Sahitya Akademi award in protest against the rising intolerance in the society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Two Assamese writers to return Akademi awards to express disapproval of 'growing intolerance' - Firstpost|url = http://www.firstpost.com/india/two-assamese-writers-to-return-akademi-awards-to-express-disapproval-of-growing-intolerance-2467444.html|website = Firstpost|accessdate = 2015-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Nirupama Tamuli was born in [[Guwahati]], [[Assam]] on 17 March 1932, to Jadab Tamuli, a clerk in the Income Tax office, and Kashiswari Tamuli.{{sfn|Gogoi|2003}} She attended [[Cotton College, Guwahati]] and [[Calcutta University]], from where she received post-graduate degrees in English literature and Assamese.{{sfn|Naikar|2005|p=16}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vedanti.com/Women%20Writers%20of%20Assam/Nirupama%20Borgohain.htm|title=Nirupama Borgohain|publisher=Vedanti|accessdate=4 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1958, Tamuli married the writer and journalist [[Homen Borgohain]]. They had two sons. In 1977, they separated.{{sfn|Gogoi|2003}}

==Career==

===Journalism===
Borgohain worked as a lecturer of English at various colleges, as well as editor of ''Saptahik Sanchipat'' and ''Chitrangada''.{{sfn|Naikar|2005|p=16}}

Between 1968 and 1980, Borgohain worked at the weekly magazine ''Saptahik Neelachal'', which she was responsible for developing into one of the most influential in Assam.{{sfn|AT|2012}} From 1979&amp;ndash;85, there was a [[Assam Movement|nativist agitation in Assam]] against the influx of alleged illegal immigrants from Bangladesh, and several camps were attacked by the activists. Borgohain's investigation into these attacks resulted in essays that led to her controversial sacking from the magazine.{{sfn|Gogoi|2003}}

===Literary===
Borgohain began publishing short stories under the pseudonym Neelima Devi in the journal ''Ramdhenu''. Some of her works are ''Anek Akas'' (''Many Skies'', 1961), ''Jalachabi'' (''Movie'', 1966), ''Sunyatar Kavya'' (''Poems of Emptiness'', 1969).{{sfn|Deka|2013|p=37}}

Borgohain's first novel ''Sei Nadi Niravadhi'' (''The River Keeps Flowing'') was published in 1963. This intertwined the story of a woman with the fate of a river, while ''Ejan Budha Manuh'' (''An Old Man'', 1966) centred on the relationship between a father and son, laying bare the tensions fraying it owing to an inter-caste marriage.{{sfn|Deka|2013|p=39}}

Her feminist novels ''Dinor Pisot Dinor'' (1968), ''Anya Jivan'' (1986) and ''Champavati'' were noted for their sympathetic portrayals of women facing up to oppressive social mores and the patriarchy. Meanwhile, the degradation faced by the indigent, owing to rural migration as well as the breakdown of the old established social orders, was acutely described in her ''Dinor Pisot Dinor'' as well as  ''Bhabhishat Rongat Surya'' (1980).{{sfn|Natarajan|Nelson|1996|p=39}} ''Iparor Ghor Siparor Ghor'' (''Houses of This Side and That'', 1979) again depicted the migration of rural folks to urban areas in search of a better life; the tale was told in a naturalistic form, realistic but suffused with pessimism.{{sfn|Rajan|1989|p=8}}

Borgohain's ''Abhiyatri'' (1995) was a [[biographical novel]] of the life of an Assamese freedom fighter, feminist and social activist, [[Chandraprava Saikiani]]. This won her the [[Sahitya Akademi Award|Sahitya Akademi literary award]] the following year, and is considered one of her finest novels.{{sfn|Naikar|2005|p=16}}{{sfn|Deka|2013|p=39}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4829">The '''Oil Thigh''' is the name given to the anthem and [[fight song]] of [[Queen's University]] and its sports teams, the [[Queen's Golden Gaels|Queen's Gaels]]. Although the song's official title is '''Queen's College Colours''', it is almost universally referred to by the first words of the Gaelic chorus.

==Etymology==
{{lang|gd|Oilthigh}} ({{IPA-gd|ˈɔlhɪ(j)|pron}}) is the [[Scottish Gaelic]] for "[[university]]", from ''oil'' "educate, rear", which is from [[Old Irish]] {{lang|sga|ail-}} and ''taigh'' "house" (older spelling ''tigh'') plus [[lenition]].&lt;ref&gt;MacBain, A. (1911) ''An Etymological Dictionary of the Gaelic Language'' [[Stirling]] Eneas MacKay, 1982 edition by Gairm {{ISBN|0-901771-68-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is usually spelt as a single word in modern orthography.&lt;ref&gt;Mark, C. ''The Gaelic English Dictionary'' [[Routledge]] (2004) {{ISBN|0-415-29761-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The [[Chorus effect|chorus]] was written in 1891&lt;ref name=Queens&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.queensu.ca/encyclopedia/o/oil-thigh|title= Queen's Encyclopedia|author= |date= |work= |publisher= Queen's University|accessdate=21 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; as part of a longer [[Scottish Gaelic language|Gaelic]] warcry, by three Gaelic-speaking students: Donald Cameron, F.A. McRae, and another called MacLean, whose first name is not known. The rest of the song was written in 1898 by a student, Alfred Lavell, with the title ''The Queen's College Colours'' after a disappointing loss to the [[University of Toronto]] in order to inspire the team.&lt;ref name=Queens/&gt; The second, third and fourth verses are rarely sung. In 1985 the original "Boys, go in and win" was changed to "Gaels, go in and win" to make the text gender neutral.&lt;ref name=Queens/&gt;

The song is often heard sung by students and alumni when the home team scores a point, goal, touchdown, etc., and at other school events. It is usually sung while forming a chain by linking arms behind each other's backs and performing a low-kicking [[can-can]]. The Varsity Men's and Women's Rowing teams sing the song to celebrate winning the team points championship at the OUA Rowing Championships and/or the [[Canadian_University_Rowing_Association|Canadian University Rowing Championships]] by huddling in a closed circle and performing the traditional low-kicking.  The 1892 version uses the tune of the "[[Battle Hymn of the Republic]]/[[John Brown's Body]]".&lt;ref name=Queens/&gt;

Additional stanzas that have fallen out of popular use made reference to historic victories over [[Yale University]], rival [[McGill University]], and the [[University of Toronto]].

==Lyrics==
&lt;blockquote class="template-quote"&gt;
Queen's College colours we are wearing once again,&lt;br&gt;
Soiled as they are by the battle and the rain,&lt;br&gt;
Yet another victory to wipe away the stain!&lt;br&gt;
So, Gaels, go in and win!

[[Toronto Varsity Blues|Varsity]]'s not invincible, they tremble at the news&lt;br&gt;
Of Queen's College Colours and are shaking in their shoes.&lt;br&gt;

So, Gaels, go in and win!

[[McGill University|McGill]] has met defeat before, they've heard the same old tale&lt;br&gt;
Of Queen's College colours, boys, the ones that seldom fail,&lt;br&gt;
Remember Captain Curtis and the conquerors of [[Yale Bulldogs|Yale]],&lt;br&gt;
So, Gaels, go in and win!


''Chorus'': Oil thigh, na Banrighinn...


[[Western Mustangs|Western's White and Purple]] have come down to Queen's to score,&lt;br&gt;
We sent them back to [[London, Ontario|London]] as they'd ne'er been sent before.&lt;br&gt;
And Queen's again were victors as they were in days of yore,&lt;br&gt;
So, Gaels, go in and win!


There may be other colours to the breezes oft unfurled,&lt;br&gt;
And many another college yell by student voices hurled;&lt;br&gt;
Queen's College colours are the dearest in the world,&lt;br&gt;
So, Gaels, go in and win!


What's the sport of Kings?&lt;br&gt;
Queen's! Queen's! Queen's!&lt;br&gt;
Oilthigh na Banrighinn Cha gheill! Cha gheill! Cha gheill!&lt;br&gt;
Oilthigh na Banrighinn Cha gheill! Cha gheill! Cha gheill!&lt;br&gt;
Go Queen's!

[[File:Letter of Kanamaru.jpg|thumb|300px|An example of traditional Okinawan writing circa 1471]]

[[Okinawan language]], spoken in [[Okinawa Island]], was once the official language of the [[Ryukyu Kingdom]]. At the time, documents were written in [[kanji]] and [[hiragana]], derived from [[Japan]]. 

Nowadays, most Japanese, as well as most Okinawans, tend to think of Okinawan as merely a dialect of [[Standard Japanese]], even though the language is not mutually intelligible to Japanese speakers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=ryu Central Okinawan at Ethnologue]&lt;/ref&gt; As a "dialect", modern Okinawan language is not written frequently. When it is, [[Japanese writing system|the Japanese writing system]] is generally used with an ''ad hoc'' manner. There is no standard [[orthography]] for the modern language. Nonetheless, there are a few systems announced by scholars and laypeople alike. None of them are widespread among the native speakers, but those systems can write the language with less ambiguity than the ''ad hoc'' conventions. The Roman alphabet in some form or another is used in some publications, especially those of an academic nature.

==Systems==
===Conventional usages===
The modern conventional ''ad hoc'' spellings found in Okinawa.

===Council system===
The system devised by the Council for the Dissemination of Okinawan Dialect ([https://web.archive.org/web/20070307035533/http://www4.ocn.ne.jp/~knaka/hogen/index.html 沖縄方言普及協議会]). [https://web.archive.org/web/20011031162127/http://www.okinawatimes.co.jp/spe/kotoba20010829.html]

===University of the Ryukyus system===
The system devised by [http://ryukyu-lang.lib.u-ryukyu.ac.jp/srnh/sign.html Okinawa Center of Language Study], a section of [[University of the Ryukyus]]. Unlike others, this method is intended purely as a phonetic guidance, basically uses [[katakana]] only. For the sake of an easier comparison, corresponding hiragana are used in this article.

===New Okinawan letters===
新沖縄文字 (''Shin Okinawa-moji''), devised by {{Nihongo|Yoshiaki Funazu|船津好明|Funazu Yoshiaki}}, in his textbook ''Utsukushii Okinawa no Hōgen'' (美しい沖縄の方言; "The beautiful Okinawan Dialect"; {{ISBN|4-905784-19-0}}). The rule applies to hiragana only. Katakana is used as in Japanese; just like in the conventional usage of Okinawan.

'''Oscar Peer''' (23 April 1928 – 22 December 2013) was a [[Swiss people|Swiss]] [[novelist]], [[playwright]] and [[philologist]]. His works were written in [[Romansh language|Romansch]] and [[German language|German]], and comprised epic novels, short stories, and drama. He was also well known for his [[Ladin language|Ladin]]-German [[dictionary]].

==Life==
Oscar Peer was born on 23 April 1928 in [[Lavin]], in the [[Lower Engadine]], [[Switzerland]]. His father, Jon Peer, was a one-time lumberjack, while his mother Silva Wieser belonged to a farming family. He was the fourth of five children.&lt;ref name=letemps&gt;{{cite news|title=Oscar Peer, écrivain, fils de Jon et de Silva|url=http://www.letemps.ch/Page/Uuid/a82ecdb2-b190-11dd-b87c-1c3fffea55dc#.Ur89hf3nWns|language=French|date=December 15, 2001|author=Sylvie Tanette|location=Paris|newspaper=Le Temps}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Peer began his training as a machinist before abandoning his apprenticeship to join a teachers' training school in [[Chur]]. He taught in [[Tschierv]] and [[Felsberg, Switzerland|Felsberg]] as a primary school teacher. He then proceeded to study German and [[Romance language]] at the [[University of Zurich]] and [[Sorbonne]]. He obtained his [[PhD]] with a dissertation on [[Gian Fontana]], a writer in [[Surselva]]. He worked as a middle-school teacher in [[Winterthur]], and finally as a lecturer at the Chur teachers' training college.

Peer met his wife, Monica, at the training college - he was a substitute teacher and she, a student. They had two children, Simon and Leta.&lt;ref name=suedostschweiz&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Südostschweiz|url=http://www.suedostschweiz.ch/zeitung/oscar-peer-ich-bin-selber-auch-ein-bisschen-anders|date=April 21, 2013|title=Oscar Peer: "Ich bin selber auch ein bisschen anders"|author=Fadrina Hofmann|language=German|location=Graubünden}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Peer died from a long illness on 22 December 2013 in Chur.&lt;ref name=nzz&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=[[Neue Zürcher Zeitung]]|title=Zum Tod des Schriftstellers Oscar Peer: Der Menschenzeichner|url=http://www.nzz.ch/aktuell/feuilleton/uebersicht/der-menschenzeichner-1.18211539|date=December 27, 2013|language=German|author=Roman Bucheli}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Oscar Peer was encouraged to take up writing by his older brother Andri Peer, who was also a novelist. His first published piece of narrative, ''A Wedding in Winter'', came out in 1972. His [[Vallader dialect (Romansh)|Vallader]] story ''Accord'' was published in 1978; it was made into a film in 1985. He wrote often in the Vallader dialect, and in German. His later books came out in both languages, but were not mere translations of each other. Instead, both language versions contained their own nuances and often deviated from each other; they could be considered significant works in their own right.&lt;ref name=nzz/&gt;&lt;ref name=swissinfo/&gt;

Peer rewrote his works several times and republished them in new editions. He would be satisfied with a book only when he ''could re-read it with a good conscience''.&lt;ref name=swissinfo&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/culture/Bilingual_writer_Oscar_Peer_dies.html?cid=37635252|title=Bilingual writer Oscar Peer dies|date=December 28, 2013|publisher=Swissinfo|accessdate=December 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of his earliest works was the short story ''Chasa Veglia'', published in his brother's collection ''Chalender Ladin''. He continued to rework this piece until the most recent version was published in 2010, both in German and Romansch.&lt;ref name=srf&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.srf.ch/kultur/literatur/zum-tod-des-buendner-schriftstellers-oscar-peer|title=Zum Tod des Bündner Schriftstellers Oscar Peer|language=German|date=December 27, 2013|publisher=Schweizer Radio und Fernsehen}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The world of rural Lower Engadine, where Peer was born, influenced both him and his work. His motifs were of a person excluded in a small country, of loners and rule-breakers. But he was not overtly a political writer, and in most of his prose works, history and politics are subsumed under the narrative. An exception is his memoir ''Das Raunen des Flusses'' in which the reader is introduced to the characters and places of Peer's formative years, and the events of the 1930s and 1940s in the Lower Engardine are reported.&lt;ref name=srf/&gt;

Peer's philological career culminated in the compilation of the ''Rumantsch Dicziunari, ladin-tudais-ch'', a multilingual dictionary. With this, he was able to establish a solid base for the Romansch language. Peer was a strong advocate of the importance of local idiom over standardised language.&lt;ref name=srf/&gt;

With the decline in the number of speakers of the Romansch dialects in Switzerland, the readership of works in the language has also reduced. Peer's efforts to sustain the tradition complement those of his peers - Ruth Plouda, GIon Deplazes, Clo Dori Bezzola, Andri Peer and Cla Biert.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oe1.orf.at/artikel/204737|date=August 24, 2011|author=Friederike C.

The '''''Oxford English Dictionary''''' ('''''OED''''') is the principal [[historical dictionary]] of the [[English language]], published by [[Oxford University Press]]. It traces the historical development of the English language, providing a comprehensive resource to scholars and academic researchers, as well as describing usage in its many variations throughout the world.&lt;ref&gt;"As a historical dictionary, the OED is very different from those of current English, in which the focus is on present-day meanings." [http://public.oed.com/about/]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"The OED is a historical dictionary, with a structure that is very different from that of a dictionary of current English."[http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/words/the-oxford-english-dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt; The second edition, comprising 21,728 pages in 20 volumes, was published in 1989.

Work began on the dictionary in 1857, but it was only in 1884 that it began to be published in unbound [[Serial (literature)|fascicles]] as work continued on the project, under the name of ''A New English Dictionary on Historical Principles; Founded Mainly on the Materials Collected by The Philological Society''. In 1895, the title ''The Oxford English Dictionary'' (''OED'') was first used unofficially on the covers of the series, and in 1928 the full dictionary was republished in ten bound volumes. In 1933, the title ''The Oxford English Dictionary'' fully replaced the former name in all occurrences in its reprinting as twelve volumes with a one-volume supplement. More supplements came over the years until 1989, when the second edition was published.&lt;ref name=Dickson/&gt; Since 2000, compilation of a third edition of the dictionary has been underway, approximately half of which is complete.&lt;ref name=Dickson/&gt;

The first electronic version of the dictionary was made available in 1988. The online version has been available since 2000, and as of April 2014 was receiving over two million hits per month. The third edition of the dictionary will most likely only appear in electronic form: the Chief Executive of Oxford University Press has stated that it is unlikely that it will ever be printed.&lt;ref name=Dickson/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author = Alastair Jamieson |url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/booknews/7970391/Oxford-English-Dictionary-will-not-be-printed-again.html|title = Oxford English Dictionary 'will not be printed again'|accessdate=11 August 2012|first = Alastair|website = The Telegraph|date = 29 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Simpson&gt;{{Cite news|url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/culturenews/10777079/RIP-for-OED-as-worlds-finest-dictionary-goes-out-of-print.html|title = RIP for OED as world's finest dictionary goes out of print|last = Flanagan|first = Padraic|date = 20 April 2014|work = The Telegraph|accessdate = 8 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical nature==
As a historical dictionary, the ''Oxford English Dictionary'' explains words by showing their development rather than merely their present-day usages.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/words/the-oxford-english-dictionary|title = The Oxford English Dictionary|date = |accessdate = 26 May 2015|website = Oxford Dictionaries|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, it shows definitions in the order that the sense of the word began being used, including word meanings which are no longer used. Each definition is shown with numerous short usage quotations; in each case, the first quotation shows the first recorded instance of the word that the editors are aware of and, in the case of words and senses no longer in current usage, the last quotation is the last known recorded usage. This allows the reader to get an approximate sense of the time period in which a particular word has been in use, and additional quotations help the reader to ascertain information about how the word is used in context, beyond any explanation that the dictionary editors can provide.

The format of the ''OED''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'s entries has influenced numerous other historical lexicography projects. The forerunners to the ''OED'', such as the early volumes of the ''[[Deutsches Wörterbuch]]'', had initially provided few quotations from a limited number of sources, whereas the ''OED'' editors preferred larger groups of quite short quotations from a wide selection of authors and publications. This influenced later volumes of this and other lexicographical works.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Lexicography and the OED: Pioneers in the Untrodden Forest|last = Osselton|first = Noel|publisher = Oxford University Press|year = 2000|isbn = 0191583464|location = Oxford|pages = |chapter = Murray and his European Counterparts|editor-last = Mugglestone|editor-first = Lynda}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Entries and relative size==
[[File:Murray OED vocabulary types diagram.svg|thumb|upright=1.75|right|Diagram of the types of English vocabulary included in the ''OED'', devised by [[James Murray (lexicographer)|James Murray]], its first editor.]]

According to the publishers, it would take a single person 120 years to "key in" the 59 million words of the ''OED'' second edition, 60 years to proofread them, and 540 [[megabyte]]s to store them electronically.&lt;ref name=facts2004/&gt; As of 30 November 2005, the ''Oxford English Dictionary'' contained approximately 301,100 main entries. Supplementing the entry [[headword]]s, there are 157,000 bold-type combinations and derivatives;&lt;ref&gt;A bold type combination has a significantly different meaning from the sum of its parts, for instance '''sauna-like''' is unlike an actual sauna.{{Cite web|url=http://www.oed.com/archive/oed2-preface/gen-combinations.html |title=Preface to the Second Edition: General explanations: Combinations |date=1989 |accessdate=16 May 2008 |website=Oxford English Dictionary Online |publisher= |last= |first= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080516195533/http://www.oed.com/archive/oed2-preface/gen-combinations.html |archivedate=16 May 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 169,000 italicized-bold phrases and combinations;&lt;ref&gt;Italicized combinations are obvious from their parts (for example ''television aerial''), unlike bold combinations. {{Cite web|url=http://www.oed.com/archive/oed2-preface/gen-combinations.html |title=Preface to the Second Edition: General explanations: Combinations |date=1989 |accessdate=16 May 2008 |website=Oxford English Dictionary Online |publisher= |last= |first= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080516195533/http://www.oed.com/archive/oed2-preface/gen-combinations.html |archivedate=16 May 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 616,500 word-forms in total, including 137,000 [[pronunciation]]s; 249,300 [[etymology|etymologies]]; 577,000 cross-references; and 2,412,400 usage [[quotation]]s. The dictionary's latest, complete print edition (second edition, 1989) was printed in 20 volumes, comprising 291,500 entries in 21,730 pages. The longest entry in the ''OED2'' was for the verb ''set'', which required 60,000 words to describe some 430 senses. As entries began to be revised for the ''OED3'' in sequence starting from M, the longest entry became ''make'' in 2000, then ''put'' in 2007, then ''run'' in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/29/opinion/29winchester.html?_r=0|title=A Verb for Our Frantic Time|author=Winchester|publisher=''The New York Times''|date=28 May 2011|accessdate=26 December 2013|first = Simon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author = Simpson | url = http://www.oed.com/news/updates/revisions0712.html |title=December 2007 revisions – Quarterly updates | work = Oxford English Dictionary Online |publisher=OED |date=13 December 2007 |accessdate=3 August 2010|first = John}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/dictionaries/v034/34.gilliver01.html|title = Make, put, run: Writing and rewriting three big verbs in the OED |last=Gilliver |first=Peter |authorlink=Peter Gilliver |date = 2013|journal = Dictionaries: Journal of the Dictionary Society of North America|volume = 34|accessdate = 8 June 2014|doi = 10.1353/dic.2013.0009|issue = 34|pages = 10–23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite its considerable size, the ''OED'' is neither the world's largest nor the earliest exhaustive dictionary of a language. Another earlier large dictionary is the [[Grimm brothers]]' [[Deutsches Wörterbuch|dictionary of the German language]], begun in 1838 and completed in 1961. The first edition of the ''[[Accademia della Crusca|Vocabolario degli Accademici della Crusca]]'' is the first great dictionary devoted to a modern European language (Italian) and was published in 1612; the first edition of ''[[Dictionnaire de l'Académie française]]'' dates from 1694. The official dictionary of Spanish is the ''[[Diccionario de la lengua española]]'' (produced, edited, and published by the [[Real Academia Española]]), and its first edition was published in 1780. The [[Kangxi dictionary]] of Chinese was published in 1716.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kangxi Dictionary|url=http://history.cultural-china.com/en/46H211H789.html|publisher=|accessdate=21 October 2013|website=cultural-china.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130330200345/http://history.cultural-china.com/en/46H211H789.html|archivedate=30 March 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{OED publication dates}}

===Origins===
The dictionary began as a [[Philological Society]] project of a small group of intellectuals in London (and unconnected to [[Oxford University]]):&lt;ref name=Winchester1999&gt;{{cite book |title= The Professor and the Madman|last= Winchester|first= Simon|year= 1999| publisher = HarperPerennial|location= New York|isbn= 978-0-06-083978-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|103–4,112}} [[Richard Chenevix Trench]], [[Herbert Coleridge]], and [[Frederick James Furnivall|Frederick Furnivall]], who were dissatisfied with the existing English dictionaries. The Society expressed interest in compiling a new dictionary as early as 1844,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/dictionaries/v034/34.gilliver.html|title = Thoughts on Writing a History of the ''Oxford English Dictionary'' |last=Gilliver |first=Peter |authorlink=Peter Gilliver |date = 2013|journal = Dictionaries: Journal of the Dictionary Society of North America|doi = 10.1353/dic.2013.0011|pmid = |access-date = 10 March 2015|volume = 34|pages = 175}}&lt;/ref&gt; but it was not until June 1857 that they began by forming an "Unregistered Words Committee" to search for words that were unlisted or poorly defined in current dictionaries. In November, Trench's report was not a list of unregistered words; instead, it was the study ''On Some Deficiencies in our English Dictionaries'', which identified seven distinct shortcomings in contemporary dictionaries:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url =https://archive.org/details/onsomedeficienci00trenrich |title = On Some Deficiencies in Our English Dictionaries|last = Trench|first = Richard Chenevix|date = 1857|journal = Transactions of the Philological Society|accessdate = |doi = |volume = 9|pages = 3–8}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Incomplete coverage of obsolete words
* Inconsistent coverage of families of related words
* Incorrect dates for earliest use of words
* History of obsolete senses of words often omitted
* Inadequate distinction among [[synonyms]]
* Insufficient use of good illustrative quotations
* Space wasted on inappropriate or redundant content.

The Society ultimately realized that the number of unlisted words would be far more than the number of words in the English dictionaries of the 19th century, and shifted their idea from covering only words that were not already in English dictionaries to a larger project. Trench suggested that a new, truly ''comprehensive'' dictionary was needed. On 7 January 1858, the Society formally adopted the idea of a comprehensive new dictionary.&lt;ref name=Winchester1999/&gt;{{rp|107–8}} Volunteer readers would be assigned particular books, copying passages illustrating word usage onto quotation slips. Later the same year, the Society agreed to the project in principle, with the title ''A New English Dictionary on Historical Principles'' (''NED'').&lt;ref name=Craigie/&gt;{{rp|ix–x}}

===Early editors===
[[Richard Chenevix Trench]] (1807–1886) played the key role in the project's first months, but his [[Church of England]] appointment as [[List of Deans of Westminster|Dean of Westminster]] meant that he could not give the dictionary project the time that it required. He withdrew and [[Herbert Coleridge]] became the first editor.&lt;ref name=Mugglestone&gt;{{Cite book|title = Lost for Words: The Hidden History of the Oxford English Dictionary|last = Mugglestone|first = Lynda|publisher = Yale University Press|year = 2005|isbn = 978-0-300-10699-2|location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|8–9}}

[[File:FrederickJamesFurnivall.jpg|frame|left|[[Frederick James Furnivall|Frederick Furnivall]], 1825–1910]]

On 12 May 1860, Coleridge's dictionary plan was published and research was started. His house was the first editorial office. He arrayed 100,000 quotation slips in a 54 pigeon-hole grid.&lt;ref name=Mugglestone/&gt;{{Rp|9}} In April 1861, the group published the first sample pages; later that month, Coleridge died of [[tuberculosis]], aged 30.&lt;ref name=Craigie/&gt;{{Rp|x}}

Furnivall then became editor; he was enthusiastic and knowledgeable, but temperamentally ill-suited for the work.&lt;ref name=Winchester1999/&gt;{{rp|110}} Many volunteer readers eventually lost interest in the project, as Furnivall failed to keep them motivated. Furthermore, many of the slips were misplaced.

Furnivall believed that, since many printed texts from earlier centuries were not readily available, it would be impossible for volunteers to efficiently locate the quotations that the dictionary needed. As a result, he founded the [[Early English Text Society]] in 1864 and the Chaucer Society in 1868 to publish old manuscripts.&lt;ref name=Craigie/&gt;{{Rp|xii}} Furnivall's preparatory efforts lasted 21 years and provided numerous texts for the use and enjoyment of the general public, as well as crucial sources for lexicographers, but they did not actually involve compiling a dictionary. Furnivall recruited more than 800 volunteers to read these texts and record quotations. While enthusiastic, the volunteers were not well trained and often made inconsistent and arbitrary selections. Ultimately, Furnivall handed over nearly two tons of quotation slips and other materials to his successor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.oed.com/page/reading/Reading$0020Programme|title = Reading Programme|date = |accessdate = 7 June 2014|website = Oxford English Dictionary Online|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1870s, Furnivall unsuccessfully attempted to recruit both [[Henry Sweet]] and [[Henry Nicol]] to succeed him. He then approached [[James Murray (lexicographer)|James Murray]], who accepted the post of editor. In the late 1870s, Furnivall and Murray met with several publishers about publishing the dictionary. In 1878, Oxford University Press agreed with Murray to proceed with the massive project; the agreement was formalized the following year.&lt;ref name=Winchester1999/&gt;{{rp|111–2}} The dictionary project finally had a publisher 20 years after the idea was conceived. It was another 50 years before the entire dictionary was complete.

Late in his editorship, Murray learned that a prolific reader named [[William Chester Minor|W. C. Minor]] was a criminal lunatic.&lt;ref name=Winchester1999/&gt;{{rp|xiii}}  Minor was a Yale University-trained surgeon and military officer in the [[American Civil War]], and was confined to [[Broadmoor Hospital|Broadmoor Asylum for the Criminally Insane]] after killing a man in London. Minor invented his own quotation-tracking system, allowing him to submit slips on specific words in response to editors' requests. The story of Murray and Minor later served as the central focus of ''[[The Surgeon of Crowthorne]]'' (US title: ''The Professor and the Madman''&lt;ref name=Winchester1999/&gt;), a popular book about the creation of the ''OED''.

===Oxford editors===
[[File:James-Murray.jpg|thumb|right|[[James Murray (lexicographer)|James Murray]] in the Scriptorium at Banbury Road]]

During the 1870s, the [[Philological Society]] was concerned with the process of publishing a dictionary with such an immense scope.&lt;ref name=Dickson/&gt; They had pages printed by publishers, but no publication agreement was reached; both the [[Cambridge University Press]] and the [[Oxford University Press]] were approached. The OUP finally agreed in 1879 (after two years of negotiating by Sweet, Furnivall, and Murray) to publish the dictionary and to pay Murray, who was both the editor and the [[Philological Society]] president. The dictionary was to be published as interval fascicles, with the final form in four volumes, totalling 6,400 pages. They hoped to finish the project in ten years.&lt;ref name=Mugglestone/&gt;{{Rp|1}}

Murray started the project, working in a [[corrugated iron]] outbuilding called the "[[Scriptorium]]" which was lined with wooden planks, book shelves, and 1,029 pigeon-holes for the quotation slips.&lt;ref name=Craigie/&gt;{{Rp|xiii}} He tracked and regathered Furnivall's collection of quotation slips, which were found to concentrate on rare, interesting words rather than common usages. For instance, there were ten times as many quotations for ''abusion'' as for ''abuse''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last= Murray| first= K. M. Elizabeth | title= Caught in the Web of Words: James Murray and the Oxford English Dictionary|year= 1977|publisher= Yale University Press| isbn= 978-0-300-08919-6|page= 178}}&lt;/ref&gt; He appealed, through newspapers distributed to bookshops and libraries, for readers who would report "as many quotations as you can for ordinary words" and for words that were "rare, obsolete, old-fashioned, new, peculiar or used in a peculiar way".&lt;ref name="caught178"&gt;{{cite book| last= Murray| first= K.

Elizabeth | title= Caught in the Web of Words: James Murray and the Oxford English Dictionary|year= 1977|publisher= Yale University Press| isbn= 978-0-300-08919-6|page= 178}}&lt;/ref&gt; Murray had American philologist and [[liberal arts college]] professor [[Francis March]] manage the collection in North America; 1,000 quotation slips arrived daily to the Scriptorium and, by 1880, there were 2,500,000.&lt;ref name=Mugglestone/&gt;{{Rp|15}}

The first dictionary fascicle was published on 1 February 1884—twenty-three years after Coleridge's sample pages. The full title was ''A New English Dictionary on Historical Principles; Founded Mainly on the Materials Collected by The Philological Society''; the 352-page volume, words from ''A'' to ''Ant'', cost 12[[shilling|s]] 6[[Penny (British pre-decimal coin)|d]].&lt;ref name=Mugglestone/&gt;{{rp|251}} (or about $668.24 in 2013) The total sales were only 4,000 copies.&lt;ref name=Winchester2003&gt;{{cite book| last= Winchester| first= Simon| title = The Meaning of Everything: The Story of the Oxford English Dictionary|year=2003|publisher= Oxford University Press|isbn= 0-19-860702-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|169}}

The OUP saw that it would take too long to complete the work with unrevised editorial arrangements. Accordingly, new assistants were hired and two new demands were made on Murray.&lt;ref name=Mugglestone/&gt;{{rp|32–33}} The first was that he move from [[Mill Hill]] to [[Oxford, England|Oxford]], which he did in 1885. Murray had his Scriptorium re-erected on his new property.&lt;ref name=Craigie/&gt;{{Rp|xvii}}

[[File:78 Banbury Road Oxford 20060715.jpg|thumb|left|The 78 Banbury Road, [[Oxford]], house, erstwhile residence of [[James Murray (lexicographer)|James Murray]], Editor of the ''Oxford English Dictionary'']]
Murray resisted the second demand: that if he could not meet schedule, he must hire a second, senior editor to work in parallel to him, outside his supervision, on words from elsewhere in the alphabet. Murray did not want to share the work, feeling that he would accelerate his work pace with experience. That turned out not to be so, and Philip Gell of the OUP forced the promotion of Murray's assistant [[Henry Bradley]] (hired by Murray in 1884), who worked independently in the [[British Museum]] in London beginning in 1888. In 1896, Bradley moved to Oxford University.&lt;ref name=Mugglestone/&gt;

Gell continued harassing Murray and Bradley with his business concerns—containing costs and speeding production—to the point where the project's collapse seemed likely. Newspapers reported the harassment, particularly the ''[[Saturday Review (London)|Saturday Review]]'', and public opinion backed the editors.&lt;ref name=Winchester2003/&gt;{{rp|182–83}} Gell was fired, and the university reversed his cost policies. If the editors felt that the dictionary would have to grow larger, it would; it was an important work, and worth the time and money to properly finish.

Neither Murray nor Bradley lived to see it. Murray died in 1915, having been responsible for words starting with ''A–D'', ''H–K'', ''O–P'', and ''T'', nearly half the finished dictionary; Bradley died in 1923, having completed ''E–G'', ''L–M'', ''S–Sh'', ''St'', and ''W–We''. By then, two additional editors had been promoted from assistant work to independent work, continuing without much trouble. [[William Craigie]] started in 1901 and was responsible for ''N'', ''Q–R'', ''Si–Sq'', ''U–V'', and ''Wo–Wy.''&lt;ref name=Craigie/&gt;{{Rp|xix}} The OUP had previously thought London too far from Oxford but, after 1925, Craigie worked on the dictionary in Chicago, where he was a professor.&lt;ref name=Craigie/&gt;{{rp|xix}}&lt;ref name=Mugglestone/&gt; The fourth editor was [[Charles Talbut Onions]], who compiled the remaining ranges starting in 1914: ''Su–Sz'', ''Wh–Wo'', and ''X–Z''.&lt;ref name=Lex-LMugg&gt;{{cite book|last=Mugglestone|first=Lynda|title=Lexicography and the OED : Pioneers in the Untrodden Forest|year=2000|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=245}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1919–1920, [[J. R. R. Tolkien]] was employed by the ''OED'', researching etymologies of the ''Waggle'' to ''Warlock'' range;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://public.oed.com/history-of-the-oed/contributors/#tolkien |title= Contributors: Tolkien | contribution = |publisher= |date= |accessdate=3 October 2012|website = Oxford English Dictionary Online}}&lt;/ref&gt; later he parodied the principal editors as "The Four Wise Clerks of Oxenford" in the story ''[[Farmer Giles of Ham]]''.&lt;ref name=Considine&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.euralex.org/elx_proceedings/Euralex1998_2/John%20CONSIDINE%20Why%20do%20large%20historical%20dictionaries%20give%20so%20much%20pleasure%20to%20their%20owners%20and%20users.pdf|title = Why do large historical dictionaries give so much pleasure to their owners and users?|last = Considine|first = John|date = 1998|journal = Proceedings of the 8th EURALEX International Congress|accessdate = 8 June 2014|doi = |pages = 579–587}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By early 1894, a total of 11 fascicles had been published, or about one per year: four for ''A–B'', five for ''C'', and two for ''E''.&lt;ref name=Craigie/&gt; Of these, eight were 352 pages long, while the last one in each group was shorter to end at the letter break (which eventually became a volume break). At this point, it was decided to publish the work in smaller and more frequent instalments; once every three months beginning in 1895 there would be a fascicle of 64 pages, priced at 2s 6d. If enough material was ready, 128 or even 192 pages would be published together. This pace was maintained until World War I forced reductions in staff.&lt;ref name=Craigie/&gt;{{rp|xx}} Each time enough consecutive pages were available, the same material was also published in the original larger fascicles.&lt;ref name=Craigie/&gt;{{rp|xx}} Also in 1895, the title ''Oxford English Dictionary'' (''OED'') was first used. It then appeared only on the outer covers of the fascicles; the original title was still the official one and was used everywhere else.&lt;ref name=Craigie/&gt;{{Rp|xx}}

===Completion of first edition and first supplement===
The 125th and last fascicle covered words from ''Wise'' to the end of ''W'' and was published on 19 April 1928, and the full dictionary in bound volumes followed immediately.&lt;ref name=Craigie&gt;{{Cite book|title = A New English Dictionary on Historical Principles: Introduction, Supplement, and Bibliography|last = Craigie|first = W. A.|publisher = Clarendon Press|year = 1933|isbn = |location = Oxford|pages = |last2 = Onions|first2 = C.&amp;nbsp;T.}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|xx}}

[[William Shakespeare]] is the most-quoted writer in the completed dictionary, with ''[[Hamlet]]'' his most-quoted work. [[George Eliot]] (Mary Ann Evans) is the most-quoted female writer. Collectively, the [[Bible]] is the most-quoted work (but in many different translations); the most-quoted single work is ''[[Cursor Mundi]]''.&lt;ref name=facts2004&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://public.oed.com/history-of-the-oed/dictionary-facts/|title = Dictionary Facts|date = |accessdate = 1 June 2014|website = Oxford English Dictionary Online|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1928 and 1933, enough additional material had been compiled to make a one-volume supplement, so the dictionary was reissued as the set of 12 volumes and a one-volume supplement in 1933.&lt;ref name=Craigie/&gt;

===Second supplement===
In 1933, Oxford had finally put the dictionary to rest; all work ended, and the quotation slips went into storage. However, the English language continued to change and, by the time 20 years had passed, the dictionary was outdated.&lt;ref name=Supplement1957-1986/&gt;

There were three possible ways to update it. The cheapest would have been to leave the existing work alone and simply compile a new supplement of perhaps one or two volumes; but then anyone looking for a word or sense and unsure of its age would have to look in three different places. The most convenient choice for the user would have been for the entire dictionary to be re-edited and [[typesetting|retypeset]], with each change included in its proper alphabetical place; but this would have been the most expensive option, with perhaps 15 volumes required to be produced. The OUP chose a middle approach: combining the new material with the existing supplement to form a larger replacement supplement.

[[Robert Burchfield]] was hired in 1957 to edit the second supplement;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/dictionaries/v023/23.simpson.pdf|title = The Revolution in English Lexicography|last = Simpson|first = John|date = 2002|journal = Dictionaries: Journal of the Dictionary Society of North America|accessdate = 22 July 2014|doi = 10.1353/dic.2002.0004|volume = 23|pages = 1–15}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Charles Talbut Onions|Onions]] turned 84 that year but was still able to make some contributions as well. The work on the supplement was expected to take about seven years.&lt;ref name=Supplement1957-1986&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oed.com/archive/oed2-preface/hist-supp-oed.html |title=Preface to the Second Edition: The history of the Oxford English Dictionary: A Supplement to the Oxford English Dictionary, 1957–1986 |date=1989 |accessdate=16 May 2008 |website=Oxford English Dictionary Online |publisher= |last= |first= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080516195349/http://www.oed.com/archive/oed2-preface/hist-supp-oed.html |archivedate=16 May 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It actually took 29 years, by which time the new supplement ''(OEDS)'' had grown to four volumes, starting with ''A'', ''H'', ''O'', and ''Sea''. They were published in 1972, 1976, 1982, and 1986 respectively, bringing the complete dictionary to 16 volumes, or 17 counting the first supplement.

Burchfield emphasized the inclusion of modern-day language and, through the supplement, the dictionary was expanded to include a wealth of new words from the burgeoning fields of science and technology, as well as popular culture and colloquial speech. Burchfield said that he broadened the scope to include developments of the language in [[English-speaking world|English-speaking regions beyond the United Kingdom]], including North America, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, India, Pakistan, and the Caribbean. Burchfield also removed, for unknown reasons, many entries that had been added to the 1933 supplement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2012/nov/30/oed-history-reports-missing-point|title = Focusing on the OED's missing words is missing the point|last = Ogilvie|first = Sarah|date = 30 November 2012|work = The Guardian|accessdate = 2 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, an analysis by lexicographer Sarah Ogilvie revealed that many of these entries were in fact foreign loanwords, despite Burchfield's claim that he included more such words. The proportion was estimated from a sample calculation to amount to 17% of the foreign [[loan word]]s and words from regional forms of English. Some of these had only a single recorded usage, but many had multiple recorded citations, and it ran against what was thought to be the established ''OED'' editorial practice and a perception that he had opened up the dictionary to "World English".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Words of the World: A Global History of the Oxford English Dictionary|last = Ogilvie|first = Sarah|publisher = Cambridge University Press|year = 2012|isbn = 978-1-107-02183-9|location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = https://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/29/books/sarah-ogilvie-on-deletions-from-the-oxford-english-dictionary.html|title = Dictionary Dust-Up (Danchi Is Involved)|last = Kaufman|first = Leslie|date = 28 November 2012|work = The New York Times|accessdate = 8 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/nov/26/former-oed-editor-deleted-words|title = Former OED editor covertly deleted thousands of words, book claims|last = Flood|first = Alison|date = 26 November 2012|work = The Guardian|accessdate = 8 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the time the new supplement was completed, it was clear that the full text of the dictionary would need to be computerized. Achieving this would require retyping it once, but thereafter it would always be accessible for computer searching&amp;nbsp;– as well as for whatever new editions of the dictionary might be desired, starting with an integration of the supplementary volumes and the main text. Preparation for this process began in 1983, and editorial work started the following year under the administrative direction of Timothy J. Benbow, with [[John Simpson (lexicographer)|John A. Simpson]] and [[Edmund Weiner|Edmund S. C. Weiner]] as co-editors.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oed.com/archive/oed2-preface/hist-new-oed.html |title=Preface to the Second Edition: The history of the Oxford English Dictionary: The New Oxford English Dictionary project |date=1989 |accessdate=16 May 2008 |website=Oxford English Dictionary Online |publisher= |last= |first= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080516195137/http://www.oed.com/archive/oed2-preface/hist-new-oed.html |archivedate=16 May 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, Simpson published his memoir chronicling his years at the OED.

[[File:OED-LEXX-Bungler.jpg|right|framed|Editing an entry of the ''NOED'' using [http://domino.research.ibm.com/tchjr/journalindex.nsf/0/bc33186c36e05a9e85256bfa0067f698?OpenDocument LEXX]]]
Thus began the ''New Oxford English Dictionary (NOED)'' project. In the United States, more than 120 typists of the International Computaprint Corporation (now [[Reed Tech]]) started keying in over 350,000,000 characters, their work checked by 55 proof-readers in England.&lt;ref name=":5"/&gt; Retyping the text alone was not sufficient; all the information represented by the complex [[typography]] of the original dictionary had to be retained, which was done by [[markup (computer programming)|marking up]] the content in [[SGML]].&lt;ref name=":5"/&gt; A specialized [[Search engine (computing)|search engine]] and display software were also needed to access it. Under a 1985 agreement, some of this software work was done at the [[University of Waterloo]], Canada, at the ''Centre for the New Oxford English Dictionary'', led by [[Frank Tompa]] and [[Gaston Gonnet]]; this search technology went on to become the basis for the [[Open Text Corporation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://db.uwaterloo.ca/OED/|title = UW Centre for the New OED and Text Research|date = 10 November 2005|accessdate = 4 June 2014|website = |publisher = |last = Tompa|first = Frank}}&lt;/ref&gt; Computer hardware, database and other software, development managers, and programmers for the project were donated by the British subsidiary of [[IBM]]; the colour syntax-directed editor for the project, [http://domino.research.ibm.com/tchjr/journalindex.nsf/0/bc33186c36e05a9e85256bfa0067f698?OpenDocument LEXX], was written by [[Mike Cowlishaw]] of IBM.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpls/abs_all.jsp?arnumber=5390112|title = LEXX—A Programmable Structured Editor|last = Cowlishaw|first = Mike F.|date = 1987|journal = IBM Journal of Research and Development|accessdate = 7 June 2014|doi = 10.1147/rd.311.0073|volume = 31|issue = 1|pages = 73–80}}
&lt;/ref&gt; The [[University of Waterloo]], in Canada, volunteered to design the database. [[A. Walton Litz]], an English professor at [[Princeton University]] who served on the Oxford University Press advisory council, was quoted in [[Time (magazine)|''Time'']] as saying "I've never been associated with a project, I've never even heard of a project, that was so incredibly complicated and that met every deadline."&lt;ref name="Gray1989-3-27"&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://content.time.com/time/printout/0,8816,957301,00.html|title = A Scholarly Everest Gets Bigger|last = Gray|first = Paul|date = 27 March 1989|work = Time|accessdate = 7 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1989, the ''NOED'' project had achieved its primary goals, and the editors, working online, had successfully combined the original text, Burchfield's supplement, and a small amount of newer material, into a single unified dictionary. The word "new" was again dropped from the name, and the second edition of the ''OED,'' or the ''OED2,'' was published. The first edition [[retronym]]ically became the ''OED1''.

The ''Oxford English Dictionary 2'' was printed in 20 volumes.&lt;ref name=Dickson/&gt; For the first time, there was no attempt to start them on letter boundaries, and they were made roughly equal in size. The 20 volumes started with ''A'', ''B.B.C.'', ''Cham'', ''Creel'', ''Dvandva'', ''Follow'', ''Hat'', ''Interval'', ''Look'', ''Moul'', ''Ow'', ''Poise'', ''Quemadero'', ''Rob'', ''Ser'', ''Soot'', ''Su'', ''Thru'', ''Unemancipated'', and ''Wave''.

The content of the ''OED2'' is mostly just a reorganization of the earlier corpus, but the retypesetting provided an opportunity for two long-needed format changes. The [[headword]] of each entry was no longer capitalized, allowing the user to readily see those words that actually require a capital letter.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oed.com/archive/oed2-preface/intro-features.html |title=Preface to the Second Edition: Introduction: Special features of the Second Edition |date=1989 |accessdate=16 May 2008 |website=Oxford English Dictionary Online |publisher= |last= |first= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080516195244/http://www.oed.com/archive/oed2-preface/intro-features.html |archivedate=16 May 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Murray had devised his own notation for pronunciation, there being no standard available at the time, whereas the ''OED2'' adopted the modern [[International Phonetic Alphabet]].&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oed.com/archive/oed2-preface/intro-phonetic.html |title=Preface to the Second Edition: Introduction: The translation of the phonetic system |date=1989 |accessdate=16 May 2008 |website=Oxford English Dictionary Online |publisher= |last= |first= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080516195327/http://www.oed.com/archive/oed2-preface/intro-phonetic.html |archivedate=16 May 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the earlier edition, all foreign alphabets except Greek were [[Transliteration|transliterated]].&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt;

When the print version of the second edition was published in 1989, the response was enthusiastic. Author [[Anthony Burgess]] declared it "the greatest publishing event of the century", as quoted by the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Fisher | first = Dan| title= 20-Volume English set costs $2,500; New Oxford Dictionary – Improving on the ultimate | newspaper= Los Angeles Times|date=25 March 1989|quote=Here's novelist Anthony Burgess calling it "the greatest publishing event of the century".

===Additions series===
The supplements and their integration into the second edition were a great improvement to the ''OED'' as a whole, but it was recognized that most of the entries were still fundamentally unaltered from the first edition. Much of the information in the dictionary published in 1989 was already decades out of date, though the supplements had made good progress towards incorporating new vocabulary. Yet many definitions contained disproven scientific theories, outdated historical information, and moral values that were no longer widely accepted.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://oed.com/archive/oed2-preface/hist-new-oed-3.html |title=Preface to the Second Edition: The history of the Oxford English Dictionary: The New Oxford English Dictionary project |date=1989 |accessdate=16 December 2003 |website=Oxford English Dictionary Online |publisher= |last= |first= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20031216002745/http://oed.com/archive/oed2-preface/hist-new-oed-3.html |archivedate=16 December 2003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://oed.hertford.ox.ac.uk/main/content/view/28/159/index.html|title = Which edition contains what?|date = 28 December 2011|accessdate = 7 June 2014|website = Examining the OED|publisher = |last = Brewer|first = Charlotte}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the supplements had failed to recognize many words in the existing volumes as obsolete by the time of the second edition's publication, meaning that thousands of words were marked as current despite no recent evidence of their use.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://oed.hertford.ox.ac.uk/main/content/view/29/160/index.html|title = Review of OED3|date = 28 December 2011|accessdate = 7 June 2014|website = Examining the OED|publisher = |last = Brewer|first = Charlotte}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Accordingly, it was recognized that work on a third edition would have to begin to rectify these problems.&lt;ref name=":3"/&gt; The first attempt to produce a new edition came with the ''Oxford English Dictionary Additions Series,'' a new set of supplements to complement the ''OED2'' with the intention of producing a third edition from them.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oed.com/archive/additions-1/introduction.html |title=Preface to the Additions Series (vol. 1): Introduction |date=1993 |accessdate=16 May 2008 |website=Oxford English Dictionary Online |publisher= |last= |first= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080516214647/http://www.oed.com/archive/additions-1/introduction.html |archivedate=16 May 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The previous supplements appeared in alphabetical installments, whereas the new series had a full A–Z range of entries within each individual volume, with a complete alphabetical index at the end of all words revised so far, each listed with the volume number which contained the revised entry.&lt;ref name=":4"/&gt;

However, in the end only three ''Additions'' volumes were published this way, two in 1993 and one in 1997,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Oxford English Dictionary Additions Series|last = |first = |publisher = Clarendon Press|year = 1993|isbn = 978-0-19-861292-6|location = Oxford|pages = |volume = 1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Oxford English Dictionary Additions Series|last = |first = |publisher = Clarendon Press|year = 1993|isbn = 978-0-19-861299-5|location = Oxford|pages = |volume = 2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Oxford English Dictionary Additions Series|last = |first = |publisher = Clarendon Press|year = 1996|isbn = 978-0-19-860027-5|location = Oxford|pages = |volume = 3}}&lt;/ref&gt; each containing about 3,000 new definitions.&lt;ref name=facts2004/&gt; The possibilities of the [[World Wide Web]] and new computer technology in general meant that the processes of researching the dictionary and of publishing new and revised entries could be vastly improved. New text search databases offered vastly more material for the editors of the dictionary to work with, and with publication on the Web as a possibility, the editors could publish revised entries much more quickly and easily than ever before.&lt;ref name=Simpson2011&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVVJmnSJrDc|title = The Making of the OED, 3rd ed.|date = 31 January 2011|accessdate = 7 June 2014|website = |publisher = |last = Simpson|first = John|type = video}}&lt;/ref&gt; A new approach was called for, and for this reason it was decided to embark on a new, complete revision of the dictionary.

===Third edition===
Beginning with the launch of the first ''OED Online'' site in 2000, the editors of the dictionary began a major revision project to create a completely revised third edition of the dictionary (''OED3''), expected to be completed in 2037&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://cogscilibrarian.blogspot.com/2007/08/from-unregistered-words-to-oed3.html|title = From Unregistered Words to OED3|date = 26 August 2007|accessdate = 23 October 2007|website = CogSci Librarian|publisher = |last = Willen Brown|first = Stephanie}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite podcast |title=History of the Oxford English Dictionary |date=27 May 2007 |publisher=[[Big Ideas (TV series)|Big Ideas]] |website=[[TVOntario]] |host=[[Simon Winchester|Winchester, Simon]] |url=http://www.tvo.org/podcasts/bi/audio/BISimonWinchester052707.mp3 |accessdate=1 December 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080216045839/http://www.tvo.org/podcasts/bi/audio/BISimonWinchester052707.mp3 |archivedate=16 February 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; at a projected cost of about £34 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://public.oed.com/history-of-the-oed/|title = History of the OED|date = |accessdate = 1 June 2014|website = Oxford English Dictionary Online|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Dickson/&gt;

Revisions were started at the letter ''M'', with new material appearing every three months on the ''OED Online'' website. The editors chose to start the revision project from the middle of the dictionary in order that the overall quality of entries be made more even, since the later entries in the ''OED1'' generally tended to be better than the earlier ones. However, in March 2008, the editors announced that they would alternate each quarter between moving forward in the alphabet as before and updating "key English words from across the alphabet, along with the other words which make up the alphabetical cluster surrounding them".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://public.oed.com/the-oed-today/recent-updates-to-the-oed/previous-updates/march-2008-update/|title = March 2008 update|date = |accessdate = 1 June 2014|website = Oxford English Dictionary Online|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; With the relaunch of the ''OED Online'' website in December 2010, alphabetical revision was abandoned altogether.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://oed.hertford.ox.ac.uk/main/content/view/429/158/index.html|title = OED Online and OED3|date = 12 February 2012|accessdate = 7 June 2014|website = Examining the OED|publisher = |last = Brewer|first = Charlotte}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The revision is expected to roughly double the dictionary in size.&lt;ref name=Simpson/&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://public.oed.com/the-oed-today/preface-to-the-third-edition-of-the-oed/|title = Preface to the Third Edition of the OED|date = March 2000|accessdate = 1 June 2014|website = Oxford English Dictionary Online|publisher = |last = Simpson|first = John}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from general updates to include information on new words and other changes in the language, the third edition brings many other improvements, including changes in formatting and stylistic conventions to make entries clearer to read and enable more thorough searches to be made by computer, more thorough etymological information, and a general change of focus away from individual words towards more general coverage of the language as a whole.&lt;ref name=Simpson2011/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1467-968X.00044/abstract|title = Root and Branch: Revising the etymological component of the Oxford English Dictionary|last = Durkin|first = Philip N.

[[John Simpson (lexicographer)|John Simpson]] was the first chief editor of the ''OED3''. He retired in 2013 and was replaced by [[Michael Proffitt]], who is the eighth chief editor of the dictionary.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://public.oed.com/oed-editor-retirement-announcement/|title = John Simpson, Chief Editor of the Oxford English Dictionary, to retire|date = |accessdate = 7 June 2014|website = Oxford English Dictionary Online|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The production of the new edition takes full advantage of computer technology, particularly since the June 2005 inauguration of the whimsically named "Perfect [[all singing, all dancing (idiom)|All-Singing All-Dancing]] [[text editor|Editorial]] and [[annotation|Notation]] [[application software|Application]]", or "Pasadena". With this [[XML]]-based system, the attention of lexicographers can be directed more to matters of content than to presentation issues such as the numbering of definitions. The new system has also simplified the use of the quotations database, and enabled staff in New York to work directly on the dictionary in the same way as their Oxford-based counterparts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Thompson |title=Pasadena: a brand new system for the ''OED'' |url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/186412378/336536-Oxford-English-Dictionary-News-2005-12 |work=Oxford English Dictionary News |publisher=Oxford University Press |page=4 |date=December 2005 |accessdate=6 January 2014|first = Liz}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other important computer uses include internet searches for evidence of current usage, and email submissions of quotations by readers and the general public.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://public.oed.com/the-oed-today/rewriting-the-oed/collecting-the-evidence/|title = Collecting the Evidence|date = |accessdate = 8 June 2014|website = Oxford English Dictionary Online|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== New entries and words ====
''[[Wordhunt]]'' was a 2005 appeal to the general public for help in providing citations for 50 selected recent words, and produced [[antedating]]s for many. The results were reported in a BBC TV series, ''[[Balderdash and Piffle]]''. The ''OED''{{'}}s small army of devoted readers continue to contribute quotations: the department currently receives about 200,000 a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://public.oed.com/history-of-the-oed/reading-programme/|title = Reading Programme|date = |accessdate = 8 June 2014|website = Oxford English Dictionary Online|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''OED'' currently contains over 600,000 entries.&lt;ref&gt;http://public.oed.com/about/&lt;/ref&gt; They update the OED on a quarterly basis to make up for its Third Edition revising their existing entries and adding new words and senses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://public.oed.com/updates/|title=Updates to the OED {{!}} Oxford English Dictionary|work=Oxford English Dictionary|access-date=2018-10-27|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2018, more than 1,400 new words, senses, and sub-entries have been added&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://public.oed.com/blog/new-words-notes-september-2018/|title=New words notes for October 2018 {{!}} Oxford English Dictionary|date=2018-10-03|work=Oxford English Dictionary|access-date=2018-10-27|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; to the OED including "'''idiocracy'''", "'''nothingburger'''" and "'''bummock'''".

In 1971, the 13-volume ''OED1'' (1933) was reprinted as a two-volume ''Compact Edition'', by photographically reducing each page to one-half its linear dimensions; each compact edition page held four ''OED1'' pages in a [[N-up|four-up]] ("4-up") format. The two volume letters were ''A'' and ''P''; the first supplement was at the second volume's end. The ''Compact Edition'' included, in a small slip-case drawer, a [[magnifying glass]] to help in reading reduced type. Many copies were inexpensively distributed through [[Book sales club|book clubs]]. In 1987, the second supplement was published as a third volume to the ''Compact Edition''.

In 1991, for the 20-volume ''OED2'' (1989), the compact edition format was re-sized to one-third of original linear dimensions, a nine-up ("9-up") format requiring greater magnification, but allowing publication of a single-volume dictionary. It was accompanied by a magnifying glass as before and ''A User's Guide to the "Oxford English Dictionary"'', by Donna Lee Berg.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Compact Oxford English Dictionary|last = |first = |publisher = Oxford University Press|year = 1991|isbn = 978-0-19-861258-2|location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; After these volumes were published, though, book club offers commonly continued to sell the two-volume 1971 ''Compact Edition''.&lt;ref name=Considine/&gt;

Once the text of the dictionary was digitized and online, it was also available to be published on [[CD-ROM]].

==Relationship to other Oxford dictionaries==
The ''OED''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'s utility and renown as a historical dictionary have led to numerous offspring projects and other dictionaries bearing the Oxford name, though not all are directly related to the ''OED'' itself.

The ''[[Shorter Oxford English Dictionary]],'' originally started in 1902 and completed in 1933,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.euralex.org/elx_proceedings/Euralex1986/032_Lesley%20S.%20Burnett%20-Making%20it%20short_%20The%20Shorter%20Oxford%20English%20Dictionary.pdf|title = Making it short: The Shorter Oxford English Dictionary|last = Burnett|first = Lesley S.|date = 1986|journal = ZuriLEX '86 Proceedings|accessdate = 7 June 2014|doi = |pages = 229–233}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an abridgement of the full work that retains the historical focus, but does not include any words which were obsolete before 1700 except those used by [[Shakespeare]], [[John Milton|Milton]], [[Edmund Spenser|Spenser]], and the [[King James Bible]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=146764|title = Shortening the ''OED'': Experience with a Grammar-Defined Database|last = Blake|first = G. Elizabeth|date = 1992|journal = ACM Transactions on Information Systems|accessdate = 29 July 2014|doi = 10.1145/146760.146764|last2 = Bray|first2 = Tim|last3 = Tompa|first3 = Frank Wm|volume = 10|issue = 3|pages = 213–232}}&lt;/ref&gt; A completely new edition was produced from the ''OED2'' and published in 1993,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The New Shorter Oxford English Dictionary on Historical Principles|last = |first = |publisher = Clarendon Press|year = 1993|isbn = 978-0-19-861134-9|location = Oxford|pages = |editor-last = Brown|editor-first = Lesley}}&lt;/ref&gt; with revisions in 2002 and 2007.

The [[Concise Oxford English Dictionary|''Concise Oxford Dictionary'']] is a different work, which aims to cover current English only, without the historical focus. The original edition, mostly based on the ''OED1'', was edited by [[Francis George Fowler]] and [[Henry Watson Fowler]] and published in 1911, before the main work was completed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Concise Oxford Dictionary: The Classic First Edition|last = |first = |publisher = Oxford University Press|year = 2011|isbn = 978-0-19-969612-3|location = |pages = |format = facsimile reprint}}&lt;/ref&gt; Revised editions appeared throughout the twentieth century to keep it up to date with changes in English usage.

''The Pocket Oxford Dictionary of Current English'' was originally conceived by F. G. Fowler and H. W. Fowler to be compressed, compact, and concise.  Its primary source is the Oxford English Dictionary, and it is nominally an abridgment of the Concise Oxford Dictionary. It was first published in 1924.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.545900] Thompson, Della. ''The Pocket Oxford Dictionary of Current English'', 8th Edition.  Oxford University Press. 1996. {{ISBN|978-0198600459}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998 the ''[[New Oxford Dictionary of English]]'' (''NODE'') was published. While also aiming to cover current English, ''NODE'' was not based on the ''OED''. Instead, it was an entirely new dictionary produced with the aid of [[corpus linguistics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url = http://www.worldwidewords.org/reviews/re-oed1.htm |title = Review: Oxford Dictionary of English |date = 18 September 2010 |accessdate = 29 July 2014 |website = World Wide Words |publisher = |last = Quinion|first = Michael}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once ''NODE'' was published, a similarly brand-new edition of the ''Concise Oxford Dictionary'' followed, this time based on an abridgement of ''NODE'' rather than the ''OED''; ''NODE'' (under the new title of the ''Oxford Dictionary of English'', or ''ODE'') continues to be principal source for Oxford's product line of current-English dictionaries, including the ''[[New Oxford American Dictionary]]'', with the ''OED'' now only serving as the basis for scholarly historical dictionaries.

==Spelling==
{{Main article|Oxford spelling}}
The ''OED'' lists British headword spellings (e.g., ''labour'', ''centre'') with variants following (''labor'', ''center'', etc.). For the suffix more commonly spelt &lt;!-- spelt: British spelling of participle --&gt; ''-ise'' in British English, [[OUP]] policy dictates a preference for the spelling ''-ize'', e.g., ''realize'' vs. ''realise'' and ''globalization'' vs. ''globalisation''. The rationale is etymological, in that the English suffix is mainly derived from the Greek suffix ''-ιζειν'', (''-izein''), or the Latin ''-izāre''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/100447|title = -ize, suffix|date = |accessdate = 1 June 2014|website = Oxford English Dictionary Online|publisher = |last = |first = |subscription = yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, ''-ze'' is also sometimes treated as an [[American English#Morphology|Americanism]] insofar as the ''-ze'' suffix has crept into words where it did not originally belong, as with ''analyse'' (British English), which is spelt ''analyze'' in American English.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.askoxford.com/asktheexperts/faq/aboutspelling/ize?view=get |title=Verbs ending in -ize, -ise, -yze, and -yse : Oxford Dictionaries Online |publisher=Askoxford.com |date= |accessdate=3 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See also ''-ise/-ize'' at [[American and British English spelling differences#-ise, -ize (-isation, -ization)|American and British English spelling differences]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--Since 2006, the online OED version does not include the ''-ise'' variant spellings in the entry headwords, illustrating the editorial favouring of the ''-ize'' suffix.--&gt;

==Reception==
{{Unbalanced|section|talk=Criticism_section_should_be_more_general|date=May 2015}}
British prime minister [[Stanley Baldwin]] described the ''OED'' as a "national treasure".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/2/f90b88dc-462f-11e2-b780-00144feabdc0.html|title=Well-chosen words|last=|first=|date=|website=Financial Times|language=en-GB|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Author [[Anu Garg]], founder of Wordsmith.org, has called it a "lex icon".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wordsmith.org/awad/article-globeandmail.html |title=Globe &amp; Mail|publisher=Wordsmith|date =11 February 2002|accessdate=3 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tim Bray]], co-creator of Extensible Markup Language ([[XML]]), credits the ''OED'' as the developing inspiration of that [[markup language]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2003/04/09/SemanticMarkup|title = On Semantics and Markup|date = 9 April 2003|accessdate = 4 June 2014|website = ongoing by Tim Bray|publisher = |last = Bray|first = Tim}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, despite, and at the same time precisely because of, its claims of authority,&lt;ref name="OED.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oed.com/public/oedhistory |format= |publisher= |title=History of the OED |accessdate=18 February 2012|website = Oxford English Dictionary Online}}&lt;/ref&gt; the dictionary has been criticised since at least the 1960s from various angles. It has become a target precisely ''because'' of its scope, its claims to authority, its British-centredness and relative neglect of World Englishes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2013/08/13/ubc_prof_wants_to_bring_canadian_english_out_of_the_boondocks.html|title=UBC prof lobbies Oxford English dictionary to be less British|last=Luk|first=Vivian|agency=[[Canadian Press]]|newspaper=[[Toronto Star]]|date=13 August 2013|accessdate=9 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; its implied but not acknowledged focus on literary language and, above all, its influence. The OED, as a commercial product, has always had to manoeuvre a thin line between PR, marketing and scholarship and one can argue that its biggest problem is the critical uptake of the work by the interested public. In his review of the 1982 supplement,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Review of RW Burchfield A Supplement to the OED Volume 3: O—Scz|last = Harris|first = Roy|date = 1982|journal = TLS|accessdate = |doi = |volume = 3|pages = 935–6}}&lt;/ref&gt; University of Oxford linguist [[Roy Harris (linguist)|Roy Harris]] writes that criticizing the ''OED'' is extremely difficult because "one is dealing not just with a dictionary but with a national institution", one that "has become, like the English monarchy, virtually immune from criticism in principle". He further notes that neologisms from respected "literary" authors such as [[Samuel Beckett]] and [[Virginia Woolf]] are included, whereas usage of words in newspapers or other less "respectable" sources hold less sway, even though they may be commonly used. He writes that the ''OED''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'s "[b]lack-and-white lexicography is also black-and-white in that it takes upon itself to pronounce authoritatively on the rights and wrongs of usage", faulting the dictionary's [[prescriptive grammar|prescriptive]] rather than [[descriptive grammar|descriptive]] usage. To Harris, this prescriptive classification of certain usages as "''erroneous''" and the complete omission of various forms and usages cumulatively represent the "social bias[es]" of the (presumably well-educated and wealthy) compilers. However, the identification of "erroneous and catachrestic" usages is being removed from third edition entries,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://public.oed.com/how-to-use-the-oed/key-to-symbols-and-other-conventions/|last = Oxford University Press|title = Key to symbols and other conventional entries|website=Oxford English Dictionary online |date=2017 |accessdate=28 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; sometimes in favour of usage notes describing the attitudes to language which have previously led to these classifications.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/109061#eid195210375|title = literally, adv. (sense I. 1. c.) |date=September 2011 |accessdate=4 June 2014 |website=Oxford English Dictionary Online |publisher= |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Harris also faults the editors' "donnish conservatism" and their adherence to prudish [[Victorian morals]], citing as an example the non-inclusion of "various centuries-old 'four-letter words'" until 1972. However, no English dictionary included such words, for fear of possible prosecution under British obscenity laws, until after the conclusion of the [[R v Penguin Books Ltd.|''Lady Chatterley's Lover'' obscenity trial]] in 1960. The first dictionary to include the word ''fuck'' was the ''[[Penguin English Dictionary]]'' of 1965.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/75197|title = fuck, v.|date = March 2008|accessdate = 1 June 2014|website = Oxford English Dictionary Online|publisher = |last = |first = |subscription = yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Joseph Wright (linguist)|Joseph Wright]]'s ''English Dialect Dictionary'' had included ''[[shit]]'' in 1905.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/englishdialectdi05wrig#page/390/mode/2up Page 390 in part V of the ''English Dialect Dictionary'' by Joseph Wright]&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''OED''{{'}}s claims of authority have also been questioned by linguists such as Pius ten Hacken, who notes that the dictionary actively strives towards definitiveness and authority but can only achieve those goals in a limited sense, given the difficulties of defining the scope of what it includes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.euralex.org/elx_proceedings/Euralex2012/pp834-845%20ten%20Hacken.pdf|title = In what sense is the OED the definitive record of the English language?|last = ten Hacken|first = Pius|date = 2012|journal = Proceedings of the 15th EURALEX International Congress|accessdate = 28 July 2014|doi = |pages = 834–845}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Founding editor James Murray was also reluctant to include scientific terms, despite their documentation, unless he felt that they were widely enough used. In 1902, he declined to add the word "radium" to the dictionary.&lt;ref&gt;Gross, John, ''The Oxford Book of Parodies'', Oxford University Press, 2010, pg. 319&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Philip Madoc''' (5 July 1934&amp;nbsp;– 5 March 2012)&lt;ref name=BBC&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-17255287|title=Actor Philip Madoc dies aged 77|publisher=[[BBC News]]|accessdate=2012-03-05|date=5 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[Welsh people|Welsh]] actor. He performed many stage, television, radio and film roles. On television, he played [[David Lloyd George]] in ''[[The Life and Times of David Lloyd George]]'' and the lead role in the detective series ''[[A Mind to Kill]]''. His guest roles included multiple appearances in the [[cult following|cult]] series ''[[The Avengers (TV series)|The Avengers]]'' and ''[[Doctor Who]]'', as well as a famous episode of the sitcom ''[[Dad's Army]]''. He was also known to be an accomplished [[Linguistics|linguist]].

==Early life==
Madoc was born '''Philip Arvon Jones''' near [[Merthyr Tydfil]] and attended [[Cyfarthfa High School|Cyfarthfa Castle Grammar School]], where he was a member of the cricket and rugby teams,&lt;ref name=Cyfarthfa&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alangeorge.co.uk/cyfarthfa_castle_school.htm|title=Cyfartha School Photographs 1950-51 at alangeorge.co.uk|accessdate=2012-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; and displayed talent as a linguist. He then studied languages at the [[University of Wales]] and the [[University of Vienna]]. He eventually spoke seven languages, including Russian and Swedish, and had a working knowledge of Huron Indian, Hindi and Mandarin. He worked as an [[Interpreter (communication)|interpreter]], but became disenchanted with having to translate for politicians: "I did dry-as-dust jobs like political interpreting. You get to despise politicians when you have to translate the rubbish they spout."&lt;ref name="Tel obit"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/culture-obituaries/tv-radio-obituaries/9124609/Philip-Madoc.html|title=Actor Philip Madoc Obituary|publisher=''The [[Daily Telegraph]]''|accessdate=2012-03-05|location=London|date=5 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then switched to acting and won a place at the [[Royal Academy of Dramatic Art]] (RADA).

==Acting career==
Madoc acted on stage with the [[Royal Shakespeare Company]], playing the roles of [[Iago]], [[Othello]] and [[Faust|Dr Faust]].&lt;ref name="Stephens" /&gt; As a television actor he first gained widespread recognition in two serials, first as the relentless [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] Officer Lutzig in the [[Second World War]] serial ''[[Manhunt (1969 TV series)|Manhunt]]'' (1969), and then as the vicious Huron warrior [[Magua]] in a serialisation of ''[[The Last of the Mohicans (1971 series)|The Last of the Mohicans]]'' (1971). He played a character resembling Lutzig, but for comic effect, in "[[The Deadly Attachment]]", an episode of the comedy ''[[Dad's Army]]'' in which he played a [[U-boat]] captain held prisoner by the [[Walmington-on-Sea]] platoon of the [[British Home Guard|Home Guard]]. He records names on his "list" for the day of reckoning after the war is won, prompting Captain Mainwaring's famous line "Don't tell him, Pike!" Madoc's ability to give life to German villains also surfaced in the TV series ''The Fortunes of War'', directed by [[James Cellan Jones]].

He also appeared in five episodes of the TV series ''[[The Avengers (TV series)| The Avengers]]'' between 1963 and 1969 ("The Decapod", "Six Hands Across a Table", "Death of a Batman", "The Correct Way to Kill", "My Wildest Dream").

In 1974 he played a corrupt and lecherous priest, Vicar Davyd, in the [[BBC Wales]] serial ''[[Hawkmoor (TV series)|Hawkmoor]]''. In 1977 he appeared as Dr Evans in the television adaptation of Andrea Newman's book ''[[Another Bouquet]]'' (the sequel to ''[[Bouquet of Barbed Wire|A Bouquet of Barbed Wire]]'').

Madoc starred in the detective series ''[[A Mind to Kill]]'' as DCI Noel Bain. This series was made simultaneously in Welsh and English from 1994 to 2002. He appeared in episodes of the BBC [[sitcom]]s ''[[The Good Life (1975 TV series)|The Good Life]]'' and ''[[Porridge (TV series)|Porridge]]'' ("Disturbing The Peace"), and in a controversial episode of ''[[The Goodies (TV series)|The Goodies]]'' ("[[South Africa (Goodies episode)|South Africa"]]), which satirised [[Apartheid]]. He took the lead role in the BBC Wales drama ''[[The Life and Times of David Lloyd George]]''.

Films in which Madoc appeared included ''[[Operation Crossbow (film)|Operation Crossbow]]'' (1965), ''[[The Quiller Memorandum]]'' (1966), ''[[Berserk!]]'' (1967), ''[[Doppelgänger (1969 film)|Doppelgänger]]'' (1969), ''[[Hell Boats]]'' (1970), ''[[Dr. Jekyll and Sister Hyde]]'' (1971), ''[[Soft Beds, Hard Battles]]'' (1974) and ''[[Operation Daybreak]]'' (1975). His later film performances included [[Leon Trotsky]] in ''[[Zina (film)|Zina]]'' (1985), and [[Jimmy Murphy (footballer)|Jimmy Murphy]] in the football movie ''[[Best (film)|Best]]'' (2000).

Madoc presented an educational 1960s BBC television series, ''Komm mit! Wir sprechen Deutsch: German by television''.

==Science-fiction roles==
Madoc appeared in the second ''[[Doctor Who]]'' film, ''[[Daleks' Invasion Earth 2150 A.D.]]'' (1966) and later in the BBC series itself. He appeared in two [[Second Doctor]] serials &amp;mdash; ''[[The Krotons]]'' where he played Eelek, a high-ranking member of Gond Society, and ''[[The War Games]]'', where he played the villainous alien War Lord.

'''Pandit Tara Singh Narotam''' (1822–1891) or also Pundit Tara Singh Nawtam was a famous [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]] scholar who belonged to the [[Sikh]] [[Nirmala (sect)|Nirmala]] Sect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Singh|first=Trilochan|title=The Turban and the Sword of the Sikhs: Essence of Sikhism : History and Exposition of Sikh Baptism, Sikh Symbols, and Moral Code of the Sikhs, Rehitnāmās|date=2011|publisher=B. Chattar Singh Jiwan Singh|isbn=9788176014915|page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made many contributions to Sikh theology and Sikh literature, he discovered [[Hemkunt]], and he became the ''Sri Mahant'' (head) of the Nirmal Pachchayati Akhara at [[Kankhal]].

== Biography ==
Pundit Tara Singh was born into a Sikh family who were originally Brahmins. At the age of twenty he left his village, which was near [[Qadian]], and he arrived at the Niramala ''[[dera]]'' of Sant Gulab Singh&lt;ref name="HS_1998"&gt;{{cite book|last=Singh|first=Harbans|title=The Encyclopaedia of Sikhism: S-Z|date=1998|publisher=Publications Bureau|isbn=9788173805301|page=315}}&lt;/ref&gt; at Kurala, [[Hoshiarpur district|Hoshiarpur]]. Here he was initiated into the Niramala order and taught the Sikh texts and scriptures. For further learning he went to [[Amritsar]] and also to [[Varanasi|Kashi]] where he studied [[Sanskrit]] and [[Vedic]] literature. He then spent some time in the Bengali city of [[Shantipur]]. He also attended the [[Kumbh Mela|Arddha Kumbha]] 1861 at [[Haridwar]].

He was now a renowned scholar and had accumulated some fame throughout the region. The [[Maharaja of Patiala]], Maharaja Narinder Singh (1824–1862) gave patronage to him&lt;ref name="HS_1998"/&gt; after which Tara Singh came to Patiala and established his own Nirmala dera by the name of Dharam Dhuja and began doing scholarly work. Pundit Tara Singh taught a large group of scholars which include the famous Sikh historian Giani Gain Singh (1822–1921) and Bishan Singh Ji Muralewale of the [[Damdami Taksal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Leaders of Damdami Taksaal|url=http://www.damdamitaksaal.org/history/leaders/50-sant-baba-bishan-singh-ji-muralewale|publisher=Damdami Taksal|accessdate=6 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sant Attar Singh (1822–1927) also studied from a Nirmala sect during this time. In 1875 Pundit Tara Singh was made the ''Sri Mahant'' (head) of the Nirmal Pachchayati Akhara ([[Kankhal]]), the central organisation of the Nirmala sect.

=== Sri Gur Tirath Sangrah  ===
Maharaja Narinder Singh of Patiala commissioned to Pandit Tara Singh Narotam to compile a comprehensive list of all the gurudwaras commemorating the life and work of the Gurus. This work was entitled Sri Gur Tirath Sangrah and published in 1884. Pundit Tara Singh provided the descriptions of 508 different locations and [[Hemkunt]] was of one of these.

=== Finding Hemkunt ===
[[File:Hemkund Lake.JPG|thumb|[[Hemkund|Hemkunt]] Lake]]
Pundit Tara Singh was the first Sikh to trace the geographical location of [[Hemkunt]] Sahib. Using clues from the [[Bachitar Natak]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Singh Johar|first1=Surinder|title=Holy Sikh Shrines|date=1998|isbn=9788175330733|location=New Delhi|publisher=M.D. Publications Pvt. Ltd|page=168}}&lt;/ref&gt; to reveal [[Guru Gobind Singh]]'s ''tap asthan'' (place of meditation) such as the place was named Sapatsring (seven peaks) and was on or near ''Hemkunt Parbat'' (lake of ice mountain) he set out to explore the [[Garhwal Himalaya]]s and his search took him to [[Badrinath]] and to the nearby village of Pandukeshwar, near the present-day Gobind Ghat. It seems, however, that Narotam's discovery 
was not heeded by the Sikh community until the twentieth century, when Hemkunt was rediscovered Sohan Singh and Modan Singh.

==Gurbani Interpretation==
Pundit Tara Singh conforms to the Nirmala school of thought. He presents Sikhism from a [[Vedantic]] orientation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pemberton|first=Kelly|title=Shared Idioms, Sacred Symbols, and the Articulation of Identities in South Asia|date=2011|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781135904777|page=76}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it being a blend of [[Adi Shankara|Sankara]] and [[Ramanuja]]. He believed that Guru Nanak Dev was an incarnation of [[Vishnu]] and that [[Waheguru]] was another name of Vishnu and could not refer to the nirguna concept of God. He wrote extensively about the meaning of Waheguru in his book Waheguru Shabad-Arth Tika. In the [[Mahan Kosh]] it is written that Pandit Tara Singh believes that the [[Sarbloh Granth]] was produced by Bhai Sukha Singh the head [[Granthi]] of [[Takht Sri Patna Sahib|Patna Sahib]] from a manuscript given by an [[Udasi]] from Jagannath ([[Odisha|Orissa]]) who said it was [[Guru Gobind Singh]]'s writing. Pandit Tara Singh also believes that the entire [[Dasam Granth]] was written by Guru Gobind Singh.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kapoor|first=Sukhbhir|title=Dasam Granth An Introductory Study|date=2009|publisher=Hemkunt Press|isbn=9788170103257|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Published works==
He may have written an commentary on the entire SGGS but it is assumed to be lost. His more famous works are Gurmat Nirnay Sagar, Sri Gur Tirath Sangrah and Guru Girarath Kos. Other notable works include a commentary on Bani of the [[Bhagat]]s included in the [[Guru Granth Sahib]].

The Sanskrit [[Attributive verb#English|verbal adjective]] ''{{IAST|sáṃskṛta-}}'' is a compound word consisting of ''sams'' (together, good, well, perfected) and ''krta-'' (made, formed, work).&lt;ref name="StevensonWaite2011"&gt;{{harvnb|Angus Stevenson|Maurice Waite|2011|p=1275}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Shlomo Biderman|2008|p=90}} It connotes a work that has been "well prepared, pure and perfect, polished, sacred".{{sfn|Will Durant|1963|p=406}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Sir Monier Monier-Williams|title=A Sanskrit-English Dictionary: Etymologically and Philologically Arranged with Special Reference to Cognate Indo-European Languages|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zUezTfym7CAC |year=2005|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass  |isbn=978-81-208-3105-6|page=1120}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Louis Renou|Jagbans Kishore Balbir|2004| pp=1-2}} According to Biderman, the perfection contextually being referred to in the etymological origins of the word is its tonal qualities, rather than semantic. Sound and oral transmission were highly valued quality in ancient India, and its sages refined the alphabet, the structure of words and its exacting grammar into a "collection of sounds, a kind of sublime musical mold", states Biderman, as an integral language they called Sanskrit.{{sfn|Shlomo Biderman|2008|p=90}} From late Vedic period onwards, state Annette Wilke and Oliver Moebus, resonating sound and its musical foundations attracted an "exceptionally large amount of linguistic, philosophical and religious literature" in India. The sound was visualized as "pervading all creation", another representation of the world itself, the "mysterious magnum" of the Hindu thought. The search for perfection in thought and of salvation was one of the dimensions of sacred sound, and the common thread to weave all ideas and inspirations became the quest for what the ancient Indians believed to be a perfect language, the "phonocentric episteme" of Sanskrit.&lt;ref name="WilkeMoebus2011p62"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Annette Wilke|author2=Oliver Moebus|title=Sound and Communication: An Aesthetic Cultural History of Sanskrit Hinduism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9wmYz_OtZ_gC |year=2011|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|isbn=978-3-11-024003-0|pages=62–66 with footnotes}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Guy L.

Sanskrit as a language competed with numerous less exact vernacular Indian languages called Prakritic languages (''{{IAST|[[Prakrit|prākṛta]]-}}''). The term ''prakrta'' literally means "original, natural, normal, artless", states Franklin Southworth.&lt;ref name="Southworth2004"&gt;{{citation|last=Southworth|first=Franklin|title=Linguistic Archaeology of South Asia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hTwuFUW5aEgC&amp;pg=PA45|year=2004|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-134-31777-6|page=45}}&lt;/ref&gt; The relationship between Prakrit and Sanskrit is found in the Indian texts dated to the 1st millennium CE. Patanjali acknowledged that Prakrit is the first language, one instinctively adopted by every child with all its imperfections and later leads to the problems of interpretation and misunderstanding. The purifying structure of the Sanskrit language removes these imperfections. The early Sanskrit grammarian Dandin states, for example, that much in the Prakrit languages is etymologically rooted in Sanskrit but involve "loss of sounds" and corruptions that result from a "disregard of the grammar". Dandin acknowledged that there are words and confusing structures in Prakrit that thrive independent of Sanskrit. This view is found in the writing of Bharata Muni, the author of the ancient ''[[Natyasastra]]'' text. The early Jain scholar Namisadhu acknowledged the difference, but disagreed that the Prakrit language was a corruption of Sanskrit. Namisadhu stated that the Prakrit language was the ''purvam'' (came before, origin) and they came naturally to women and children, that Sanskrit was a refinement of the Prakrit through a "purification by grammar".&lt;ref name="KleinJoseph2017p318"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Jared Klein|author2=Brian Joseph|author3=Matthias Fritz|title=Handbook of Comparative and Historical Indo-European Linguistics: An International Handbook|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cQA2DwAAQBAJ |year=2017|publisher=Walter De Gruyter|isbn=978-3-11-026128-8|pages=318–320}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mycenaean Greek is the older recorded form of Greek, but the limited material that has survived has a highly ambiguous writing system.

* [[Hittite language|Hittite]] (c. 1750 – 1200 BCE). This is the earliest-recorded of all Indo-European languages, distinguishable into Old Hittite, Middle Hittite and Neo-Hittite. It is divergent from the others likely due to its early separation. Discovered on clay tablets of central Turkey in cuneiform script, it possesses some highly archaic features found only fragmentarily, if at all, in other languages. At the same time, however, it appears to have undergone a large number of early phonological and grammatical changes along with the ambiguities of its writing system.

{{quote|
The Sanscrit language, whatever be its antiquity, is of a wonderful structure; more perfect than the Greek, more copious than the Latin, and more exquisitely refined than either, yet bearing to both of them a stronger affinity, both in the roots of verbs and the forms of grammar, than could possibly have been produced by accident; so strong indeed, that no philologer could examine them all three, without believing them to have sprung from ''some common source'', which, perhaps, no longer exists. There is a similar reason, though not quite so forcible, for supposing that both the Gothick and the Celtick [sic], though blended with a very different idiom, had the same origin with the Sanscrit; and the Old Persian might be added to the same family.
|William Jones, 1786|Quoted by Thomas Burrow in ''The Sanskrit Language''{{sfn|Thomas Burrow|2001|p=6}}}}

In order to explain the common features shared by Sanskrit and other Indo-European languages, the [[Indo-Aryan migration theory]] states that the original speakers of what became Sanskrit arrived in the Indian subcontinent from the north-west sometime during the early second millennium BCE. Evidence for such a theory includes the close relationship between the Indo-Iranian tongues and the [[Baltic languages|Baltic]] and [[Slavic languages]], vocabulary exchange with the non-Indo-European [[Uralic languages]], and the nature of the attested Indo-European words for flora and fauna.{{sfn|Colin P. Masica|1993|p=36-38}} The pre-history of Indo-Aryan languages which preceded Vedic Sanskrit is unclear and various hypotheses place it over a fairly wide limit. According to Thomas Burrow, based on the relationship between various Indo-European languages, the origin of all these languages may possibly be in what is now Central or Eastern Europe, while the Indo-Iranian group possibly arose in Central Russia.{{sfn|Thomas Burrow|2001|pp=30-32}} The Iranian and Indo-Aryan branches separated quite early. It is the Indo-Aryan branch that moved into eastern Iran and the south into the Indian subcontinent in the first half of the 2nd millennium BCE. Once in ancient India, the Indo-Aryan language underwent rapid linguistic change and morphed into the Vedic Sanskrit language.{{sfn|Thomas Burrow|2001|pp=30-34}}

O Brihaspati, when in giving names

Their most excellent and spotless secret
   was laid bare through love,
When the wise ones formed Language with their mind,
   purifying it like grain with a winnowing fan,
Then friends knew friendships –
   an auspicious mark placed on their language.

The Vedic Sanskrit found in the ''Rigveda'' is distinctly more archaic than other Vedic texts, and in many respects, the Rigvedic language is notably more similar to those found in the archaic texts of Old Avestan [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrian]] ''Gathas'' and Homer's ''Iliad'' and ''Odyssey''.&lt;ref name="Lowe2015p2"&gt;{{cite book|author=John Jeffrey Lowe|title=Participles in Rigvedic Sanskrit: The Syntax and Semantics of Adjectival Verb Forms|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=u7u6BwAAQBAJ|year=2015|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-870136-1|pages=2–3}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Stephanie W. Jamison and Joel P. Brereton – Indologists known for their translation of the ''Rigveda'', the Vedic Sanskrit literature "clearly inherited" from Indo-Iranian and Indo-European times, the social structures such as the role of the poet and the priests, the patronage economy, the phrasal equations and some of the poetic meters.{{sfn|Stephanie W. Jamison|Joel P. Brereton|2014|pp=10-11, 72}}{{refn|group=note|An example of the shared phrasal equations is the ''dyaus pita'' in Vedic Sanskrit, which means "father Heaven". The Mycenaean Greek equivalent is ''Zeus Pater'', which evolved to ''Jupiter'' in Latin. Equivalent "paternal Heaven" phrasal equation is found in many Indo-European languages.{{sfn|Stephanie W. Jamison|Joel P. Brereton|2014|p=50}}}} While there are similarities, state Jamison and Brereton, there are also differences between Vedic Sanskrit, the Old Avestan, and the Mycenaean Greek literature. For example, unlike the Sanskrit similes in the ''Rigveda'', the Old Avestan ''Gathas'' lack simile entirely, and it is rare in the later version of the language. The Homerian Greek, like Rigvedic Sanskrit, deploys simile extensively, but they are structurally very different.{{sfn|Stephanie W. Jamison|Joel P. Brereton|2014|pp=66-67}}

=== Classical Sanskrit ===
The early Vedic form of the Sanskrit language was far less homogenous, and it evolved over time into a more structured and homogeneous language, ultimately into the Classical Sanskrit by about the mid-1st-millennium BCE. According to Richard Gombrich – an Indologist and a scholar of Sanskrit Pāli and Buddhist Studies, the archaic Vedic Sanskrit found in the ''Rigveda'' had already evolved in the Vedic period, as evidenced in the later Vedic literature. The language in the early Upanishads of Hinduism and the late Vedic literature approaches Classical Sanskrit, while the archaic Vedic Sanskrit had by the [[Buddha]]'s time become unintelligible to all except ancient Indian sages, states Gombrich.&lt;ref name="Gombrich2006p24"&gt;{{cite book|author=Richard Gombrich|title=Theravada Buddhism: A Social History from Ancient Benares to Modern Colombo|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jZyJAgAAQBAJ |year=2006|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-134-90352-8|pages=24–25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The {{IAST|Aṣṭādhyāyī}} was not the first description of Sanskrit grammar, but it is the earliest that has survived in full.

The Classical Sanskrit language formalized by Panini, states Renou, is "not an impoverished language", rather it is "a controlled and a restrained language from which archaisms and unnecessary formal alternatives were excluded".{{sfn|Louis Renou|Jagbans Kishore Balbir|2004|pp=53}} The Classical form of the language simplified the ''sandhi'' rules but retained various aspects of the Vedic language, while adding rigor and flexibilities, so that it had sufficient means to express thoughts as well as being "capable of responding to the future increasing demands of an infinitely diversified literature", according to Renou. Panini included numerous "optional rules" beyond the Vedic Sanskrit's ''bahulam'' framework, to respect liberty and creativity so that individual writers separated by geography or time would have the choice to express facts and their views in their own way, where tradition followed competitive forms of the Sanskrit language.{{sfn|Louis Renou|Jagbans Kishore Balbir|2004|pp=53-54}}

According to Sanskrit linguist [[Madhav Kashinath Deshpande|Madhav Deshpande]], Sanskrit was a spoken language in a colloquial form by the mid 1st millennium BCE which coexisted with a more formal, grammatical correct form of literary Sanskrit.{{sfn|Deshpande|2011|pp=218-220}} This, states Deshpande, is true for modern languages where colloquial incorrect approximations and dialects of a language are spoken and understood, along with more "refined, sophisticated and grammatically accurate" forms of the same language being found in the literary works.{{sfn|Deshpande|2011|pp=218-220}} The Indian tradition, states [[Moriz Winternitz]], has favored the learning and the usage of multiple languages from the ancient times. Sanskrit was a spoken language in the educated and the elite classes, but it was also a language that must have been understood in a more wider circle of society because the widely popular folk epics and stories such as the ''[[Ramayana]]'', the ''[[Mahabharata]]'', the ''[[Bhagavata Purana]]'', the ''[[Panchatantra]]'' and many other texts are all in the Sanskrit language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Moriz Winternitz|title=A History of Indian Literature|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JRfuJFRV_O8C|year=1996|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass |isbn=978-81-208-0264-3|pages=42–46}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Classical Sanskrit with its exacting grammar was thus the language of the Indian scholars and the educated classes, while others communicated with approximate or ungrammatical variants of it as well as other natural Indian languages.{{sfn|Deshpande|2011|pp=218-220}} Sanskrit, as the learned language of Ancient India, thus existed alongside the vernacular Prakrits.{{sfn|Deshpande|2011|pp=218-220}} Many [[Sanskrit drama]]s indicate that the language coexisted with the vernacular Prakrits. Centres in [[Varanasi]], [[Paithan]], [[Pune]] and [[Kanchipuram]] were centers of classical Sanskrit learning and public debates until the arrival of the colonial era.{{sfn|Deshpande|2011|pp=222-223}}

According to [[Étienne Lamotte]] – an Indologist and Buddhism scholar, Sanskrit became the dominant literary and inscriptional language because of its precision in communication. It was, states Lamotte, an ideal instrument for presenting ideas and as knowledge in Sanskrit multiplied so did its spread and influence.&lt;ref&gt;Etinne Lamotte (1976), ''Histoire du buddhisme indien, des origines à l'ère saka'', Tijdschrift Voor Filosofie 21 (3):539-541, Louvain-la-Neuve: Université de Louvain, Institut orientaliste&lt;/ref&gt; Sanskrit was adopted voluntarily as a vehicle of high culture, arts, and profound ideas. Pollock disagrees with Lamotte, but concurs that Sanskrit's influence grew into what he terms as "Sanskrit Cosmopolis" over a region that included all of South Asia and much of southeast Asia. The Sanskrit language cosmopolis thrived beyond India between 300 and 1300 CE.&lt;ref name=pollock1996p197&gt;{{cite book|author=Sheldon Pollock| editor= Jan Houben| title= The Sanskrit Cosmopolis, A.D. 300–1300: Transculturation, Vernacularization, and the Question of Ideology, in "Ideology and status of Sanskrit: contributions to the history of the Sanskrit language" |publisher=E.J.

The Sanskrit language created a pan-Indic accessibility to information and knowledge in the ancient and medieval times, in contrast to the Prakrit languages which were understood just regionally.{{sfn|Deshpande|2011|pp=222-223}}{{sfn|Thomas Burrow|2001|p=60}} It created a cultural bond across the subcontinent.{{sfn|Thomas Burrow|2001|p=60}} As local languages and dialects evolved and diversified, Sanskrit served as the common language.{{sfn|Thomas Burrow|2001|p=60}} It connected scholars from distant parts of the Indian subcontinent such as Tamil Nadu and Kashmir, states Deshpande, as well as those from different fields of studies, though there must have been differences in its pronunciation given the first language of the respective speakers. The Sanskrit language brought Indic people together, particularly its elite scholars.{{sfn|Deshpande|2011|pp=222-223}} Some of these scholars of Indian history regionally produced vernacularized Sanskrit to reach wider audiences, as evidenced by texts discovered in Rajasthan, Gujarat, and Maharashtra. Once the audience became familiar with the easier to understand vernacularized version of Sanskrit, those interested could graduate from colloquial Sanskrit to the more advanced Classical Sanskrit. Rituals and the rites-of-passage ceremonies have been and continue to be the other occasions where a wide spectrum of people hear Sanskrit, and occasionally join in to speak some Sanskrit words such as ''"namah"''.{{sfn|Deshpande|2011|pp=222-223}}

Other scholars state that Sanskrit language did not die, only declined. Hanneder disagrees with Pollock, finding his arguments elegant but "often arbitrary". According to Hanneder, a decline or regional absence of creative and innovative literature constitutes a negative evidence to Pollock's hypothesis, but it is not positive evidence. A closer look at Sanskrit in the Indian history after the 12th-century suggests that Sanskrit survived despite the odds.

The Sanskrit language, states [[Moriz Winternitz]], was never a dead language and it is still alive though its prevalence is lesser than ancient and medieval times.

=== Modern Indic languages ===
The relationship of Sanskrit to the Prakrit languages, particularly the modern form of Indian languages, is complex and spans about 3,500 years, states [[Colin Masica]] – a linguist specializing in South Asian languages. A part of the difficulty is the lack of sufficient textual, archaeological and epigraphical evidence for the ancient Prakrit languages with rare exceptions such as Pali, leading to a tendency of [[anachronism|anachronistic]] errors.{{sfn|Colin P. Masica|1993|pp=50-57}} Sanskrit and Prakrit languages may be divided into Old Indo-Aryan (1500 BCE-600 BCE), Middle Indo-Aryan (600 BCE-1000 CE) and New Indo-Aryan (1000 CE-current), each can further be subdivided in early, middle or second, and late evolutionary substages.{{sfn|Colin P.

Vedic Sanskrit belongs to the early Old Indo-Aryan while Classical Sanskrit to the later Old Indo-Aryan stage. The evidence for Prakrits such as Pali (Theravada Buddhism) and Ardhamagadhi (Jainism), along with Magadhi, Maharashtri, Sinhala, Sauraseni and Niya (Gandhari), emerge in the Middle Indo-Aryan stage in two versions – archaic and more formalized – that may be placed in early and middle substages of the 600 BCE-1000 CE period.{{sfn|Colin P. Masica|1993|pp=50-57}} Two literary Indic languages can be traced to the late Middle Indo-Aryan stage and these are Apabhramsa and Elu (a form of literary Sinhalese). Numerous North, Central, Eastern and Western Indian languages, such as Hindi, Gujarati, Sindhi, Punjabi, Kashmiri, Nepali, Braj, Awadhi, Bengali, Assamese, Oriya, Marathi, and others belong to the New Indo-Aryan stage.{{sfn|Colin P. Masica|1993|pp=50-57}}

There is an extensive overlap in the vocabulary, phonetics and other aspects of these New Indo-Aryan languages with Sanskrit, but it is neither universal nor identical across the languages. They likely emerged from a synthesis of the ancient Sanskrit language traditions and an admixture of various regional dialects. Each language has some unique and regionally creative aspects, with unclear origins. Prakrit languages do have a grammatical structure, but like the Vedic Sanskrit, it is far less rigorous than Classical Sanskrit. The roots of all Prakrit languages may be in the Vedic Sanskrit and ultimately the Indo-Aryan language, their structural details vary from the Classical Sanskrit.&lt;ref name="Woolner1986p3"/&gt;{{sfn|Colin P.

== Phonology ==

Sanskrit shares many Proto-Indo-European phonological features, although it features a larger inventory of distinct phonemes. The consonantal system is the same, though it systematically enlarged the inventory of distinct sounds. For example, Sanskrit added a voiceless aspirated "Th", to the voiceless "T", voiced "D" and voiced aspirated "Dh" found in PIE languages.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|pp=8-9}}

The most significant and distinctive phonological development in Sanskrit is vowel-merger, states Stephanie Jamison – an Indo-European linguist specializing in Sanskrit literature.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|pp=8-9}} The short ∗e, ∗o and *a, all merge as "a" (अ) in Sanskrit, while long ∗ē, ∗ō and *ā, all merge as long "ā" (आ). These mergers occurred very early and significantly impacted Sanskrit's morphological system.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|pp=8-9}} Some phonological developments in it mirror those in other PIE languages. For example, the labiovelars merged with the plain velars as in other satem languages. However, the secondary palatalization of the resulting segments is more thorough and systematic within Sanskrit, states Jamison.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|pp=8-9}}  A series of retroflex dental stops were innovated in Sanskrit to more thoroughly articulate sounds for clarity. For example, unlike the loss of  the morphological clarity from vowel contraction that is found in early Greek and related southeast European languages, Sanskrit deployed ∗y, ∗w, and ∗s intervocalically to provide morphological clarity.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|pp=8-9}}

===Vowels===

The cardinal vowels (''svaras'') ''i'' (इ), ''u'' (उ), ''a'' (अ) distinguish length in Sanskrit, states Jamison.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|p=9}}{{sfn|Robert P. Goldman|Sally J Sutherland Goldman|2002|pp=1-9}} The short ''a'' (अ) in Sanskrit is a closer vowel than ā, equivalent to schwa. The mid vowels ē (ए) and ō (ओ) in Sanskrit are monophthongizations of the Indo-Iranian diphthongs ∗ai and ∗au. The Old Iranian language preserved *ai and ∗au.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|p=9}} In contrast, in Sanskrit, they are inherently long. The vocalic liquid r̥ in Sanskrit is a merger of PIE ∗r̥ and ∗l̥. The long r̥ is an innovation and it is used in a few analogically generated morphological categories.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|p=9}}{{sfn|Michael Coulson|Richard Gombrich|James Benson|2011|pp=21-36}}{{sfn|Colin P.

| style="background:#ccc; font-size:24px;"|{{lang|und-Deva|अः}}
|{{IAST|aḥ}}&lt;ref&gt;This ''visarga'' is a consonant, not a vowel. It's a post-vocalic [[voiceless glottal fricative]] {{IPA|[h]}}, and an [[allophone]] of ''{{IAST|s}}'' (or less commonly ''{{IAST|r}}'') usually in word-final position. Some traditions of recitation append an echo of the preceding vowel after the [h] ({{harvnb|Wikner|1996|p=6}}): &lt;span style="font-size:14pt;"&gt;{{lang|und-Deva|इः}}&lt;/span&gt; {{IPA|[ihi]}}. {{harvnb|Colin P.

|}

According to Masica, Sanskrit has four traditional semivowels, with which were classed, "for morphophonemic reasons, the liquids: y, r, l, and v; that is, as y and v were the non-syllabics corresponding to i, u, so were r, l in relation to r̥ and l̥".{{sfn|Colin P. Masica|1993|pp=160-161}} The northwestern, the central and the eastern Sanskrit dialects have had a historic confusion between "r" and "l". The Paninian system that followed the central dialect preserved the distinction, likely out of reverence for the Vedic Sanskrit that distinguished the "r" and "l". However, the northwestern dialect only had "r", while the eastern dialect probably only had "l", states Masica. Thus literary works from different parts of ancient India appear inconsistent in their use of "r" and "l", resulting in doublets that is occasionally semantically differentiated.{{sfn|Colin P. Masica|1993|pp=160-161}}

===Consonants===
Sanskrit possesses a symmetric consonantal phoneme structure based on how the sound is articulated, though the actual usage of these sounds conceals the lack of parallelism in the apparent symmetry possibly from historical changes within the language.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|pp=9-10}} The glides and liquids regularly alternate with vowels in Sanskrit, for example, i ≈ y; u ≈ v ([w]); r̥ ≈ r ; l̥ ≈ l, states Jamison.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|pp=9-10}}{{sfn|Michael Coulson|Richard Gombrich|James Benson|2011|pp=1-20}}

Sanskrit had a series of retroflex stops. All the retroflexes in Sanskrit are in "origin conditioned alternants of dentals, though from the beginning of the language they have a qualified independence", states Jamison.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|pp=9-10}}

The palatals are affricates in Sanskrit, not stops. The palatal nasal is a conditioned variant of n occurring next to palatal obstruents.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|pp=9-10}}  The ''anusvara'' that Sanskrit deploys is a conditioned alternant of postvocalic nasals, under certain sandhi conditions.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|p=10}}  Its ''visarga'' is a word-final or morpheme-final conditioned alternant of s and r under certain sandhi conditions.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|p=10}}

{{Quote box
 |quote  = '''The system of Sanskrit Sounds'''&lt;br&gt;[The] order of Sanskrit sounds works along three principles: it goes from simple to complex; it goes from the back to the front of the mouth; and it groups similar sounds together. (...) Among themselves, both the vowels and consonants are ordered according to where in the mouth they are pronounced, going from back to front.

}}
The voiceless aspirated series is also an innovation in Sanskrit but is significantly rarer than the other three series.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|pp=9-10}}

While the Sanskrit language organizes sounds for expression beyond those found in the PIE language, it retained many features found in the Iranian and Balto-Slavic languages. An example of a similar process in all three, states Jamison, is the retroflex sibilant .s being the automatic product of dental s following i, u, r, and k (mnemonically "ruki").{{sfn|Jamison|2008|p=10}}

===Phonological alternations, sandhi rules===
Sanskrit deploys extensive phonological alternations on different linguistic levels through ''sandhi'' rules (literally, the rules of "putting together, union, connection, alliance"). This is similar to the English alteration of "going to" as ''gonna'', states Jamison.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|pp=10-11}} The Sanskrit language accepts such alterations within it, but offers formal rules for the ''sandhi'' of any two words next to each other in the same sentence or linking two sentences. The external ''sandhi'' rules state that similar short vowels coalesce into a single long vowel, while dissimilar vowels form glides or undergo diphthongization.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|pp=10-11}} Among the consonants, most external ''sandhi'' rules recommend regressive assimilation for clarity when they are voiced. According to Jamison, these rules ordinarily apply at compound seams and morpheme boundaries.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|pp=10-11}} In Vedic Sanskrit, the external ''sandhi'' rules are more variable than in Classical Sanskrit.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|p=11}}

The internal ''sandhi'' rules are more intricate and account for the root and the canonical structure of the Sanskrit word. These rules anticipate what are now known as the [[Bartholomae's law]] and [[Grassmann's law]]. For example, states Jamison, the "voiceless, voiced, and voiced aspirated obstruents of a positional series regularly alternate with each other (p ≈ b ≈ bh; t ≈ d ≈ dh, etc.; note, however, c ≈ j ≈ h), such that, for example, a morpheme with an underlying voiced aspirate final may show alternants with all three stops under differing internal sandhi conditions".{{sfn|Jamison|2008|pp=11-12}} The velar series (k, g, gh) alternate with the palatal series (c, j, h), while the structural position of the palatal series is modified into a retroflex cluster when followed by dental. This rule create two morphophonemically distinct series from a single palatal series.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|pp=11-12}}

Vocalic alternations in the Sanskrit morphological system is termed "strengthening", and called ''guna'' and ''vriddhi'' in the preconsonantal versions. There is an equivalence to terms deployed in Indo-European descriptive grammars, wherein Sanskrit's unstrengthened state is same as the zero-grade, ''guna'' corresponds to normal-grade, while ''vriddhi'' is same as the lengthened-state.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|p=12}} The qualitative ablaut is not found in Sanskrit just like it is absent in Iranian, but Sanskrit retains quantitative ablaut through vowel strengthening.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|p=12}} The transformations between unstrengthened to ''guna'' is prominent in the morphological system, states Jamison, while ''vriddhi'' is a particularly significant rule when adjectives of origin and appurtenance are derived. The manner in which this is done slightly differs between the Vedic and the Classical Sanskrit.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|p=12}}{{sfn|Colin P. Masica|1993|pp=164-166}}

Sanskrit grants a very flexible syllable structure, where they may begin or end with vowels, be single consonants or clusters. Similarly, the syllable may have an internal vowel of any weight. The Vedic Sanskrit shows traces of following the Sievers-Edgerton Law, but Classical Sanskrit doesn't. Vedic Sanskrit has a pitch accent system, states Jamison, which were acknowledged by Panini, but in his Classical Sanskrit the accents disappear.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|p=13}} Most Vedic Sanskrit words have one accent. However, this accent is not phonologically predictable, states Jamison.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|p=13}} It can fall anywhere in the word and its position often conveys morphological and syntactic information.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|p=13}} According to Masica, the presence of an accent system in Vedic Sanskrit is evidenced from the markings in the Vedic texts. This is important because of Sanskrit's connection to the PIE languages and comparative Indo-European linguistics.{{sfn|Colin P. Masica|1993|pp=163-164}}

Sanskrit, like most early Indo-European languages, lost the so-called "laryngeal consonants (cover-symbol ∗H) present in the Proto-Indo-European", states Jamison.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|p=13}} This significantly impacted the evolutionary path of the Sanskrit phonology and morphology, particularly in the variant forms of roots.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|pp=13-14}}

==Morphology==
{{Main|Sanskrit grammar}}
{{See also|Vedic Sanskrit grammar}}
The basis of Sanskrit morphology is the root, states Jamison, "a morpheme bearing lexical meaning".{{sfn|Jamison|2008|p=15}} The verbal and nominal stems of Sanskrit words are derived from this root through the phonological vowel-gradation processes, the addition of affixes, verbal and nominal stems. It then adds an ending to establish the grammatical and syntactic identity of the stem. According to Jamison, the "three major formal elements of the morphology are (i) root, (ii) affix, and (iii) ending; and they are roughly responsible for (i) lexical meaning, (ii) derivation, and (iii) inflection respectively".{{sfn|Jamison|2008|pp=15-16}}

A Sanskrit word has the following canonical structure:{{sfn|Jamison|2008|p=15}}

:''Root'' + ''Affix''{{su|b=0-n}} + ''Ending''{{su|b=0-1}}

The root structure has certain phonological constraints. Two of the most important constraints of a "root" is that it does not end in a short "a" (अ) and that it is monosyllabic.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|p=15}} In contrast, the affixes and endings commonly do. The affixes in Sanskrit are almost always suffixes, with exceptions such as the augment "a-" added as prefix to past tense verb forms and the "-na/n-" infix in single verbal present class, states Jamison.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|p=15}}

A verb in Sanskrit has the following canonical structure:{{sfn|Jamison|2008|p=20}}

:''Root'' + ''Suffix''{{su|b=Tense-Aspect}} + ''Suffix''{{su|b=Mood}} + ''Ending''{{su|b=Personal-Number-Voice}}

According to Ruppel, verbs in Sanskrit express the same information as other Indo-European languages such as English.&lt;ref name="Ruppel2017p31"/&gt; Sanskrit verbs describe an action or occurrence or state, its embedded morphology informs as to "who is doing it" (person or persons), "when it is done" (tense) and "how it is done" (mood, voice). The Indo-European languages differ in the detail. For example, the Sanskrit language attaches the affixes and ending to the verb root, while the English language adds small independent words before the verb. In Sanskrit, these elements co-exist within the word.&lt;ref name="Ruppel2017p31"&gt;{{cite book|author=A. M. Ruppel|title=The Cambridge Introduction to Sanskrit |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eXQ3DgAAQBAJ |year=2017|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-107-08828-3|pages=31–33}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=note|The "root + affix" is called the "stem".&lt;ref name="Ruppel2017p34"&gt;{{cite book|author=A.

Both verbs and nouns in Sanskrit are either thematic or athematic, states Jamison.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|pp=19-20}} ''Guna'' (strengthened) forms in the active singular regularly alternate in athematic verbs. The finite verbs of Classical Sanskrit have the following grammatical categories: person, number, voice, tense-aspect, and mood. According to Jamison, a portmanteau morpheme generally expresses the person-number-voice in Sanskrit, and sometimes also the ending or only the ending. The mood of the word is embedded in the affix.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|pp=19-20}}

These elements of word architecture are the typical building blocks in Classical Sanskrit, but in Vedic Sanskrit these elements fluctuate and are unclear. For example, in the ''Rigveda'' [[preverb]]s regularly occur in [[tmesis]], states Jamison, which means they are "separated from the finite verb".{{sfn|Jamison|2008|p=15}} This indecisiveness is likely linked to Vedic Sanskrit's attempt to incorporate accent. With nonfinite forms of the verb and with nominal derivatives thereof, states Jamison, "preverbs show much clearer univerbation in Vedic, both by position and by accent, and by Classical Sanskrit, tmesis is no longer possible even with finite forms".{{sfn|Jamison|2008|p=15}}

While roots are typical in Sanskrit, some words do not follow the canonical structure.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|pp=15-16}} A few forms lack both inflection and root. Many words are inflected (and can enter into derivation) but lack a recognizable root. Examples from the basic vocabulary include kinship terms such as ''mātar-'' (mother), ''nas-'' (nose), ''śvan-'' (dog). According to Jamison, pronouns and some words outside the semantic categories also lack roots, as do the numerals. Similarly, the Sanskrit language is flexible enough to not mandate inflection.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|pp=15-16}}

The Sanskrit words can contain more than one affix that interact with each other. Affixes in Sanskrit can be athematic as well as thematic, according to Jamison.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|pp=16-17}} Athematic affixes can be alternating. Sanskrit deploys eight cases, namely nominative, accusative, instrumental, dative, ablative, genitive, locative, vocative.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|pp=16-17}}

Stems, that is "root + affix", appear in two categories in Sanskrit: vowel stems and consonant stems. Unlike some Indo-European languages such as Latin or Greek, according to Jamison, "Sanskrit has no closed set of conventionally denoted noun declensions". Sanskrit includes a fairly large set of stem-types.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|pp=17-18}} The linguistic interaction of the roots, the phonological segments, lexical items and the grammar for the Classical Sanskrit consist of four Paninian components. These, states Paul Kiparsky, are the ''Astadhyaayi'', a comprehensive system of 4000 grammatical rules, of which a small set are frequently used; ''Sivasutras'', an inventory of ''anubandhas'' (markers) that partition phonological segments for efficient abbreviations through the ''pratyharas'' technique; ''Dhatupatha'', a list of 2000 verbal roots classified by their morphology and syntactic properties using diacritic markers, a structure that guides its writing systems; and, the ''Ganapatha'', an inventory of word groups, classes of lexical systems.&lt;ref name=Kiparsky59&gt;{{cite book|author=Paul Kiparsky|editor=E.F.K. Koerner and R.E. Asher|title=Concise History of the Language Sciences: From the Sumerians to the Cognitivists |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VCqLBQAAQBAJ |year =2014|publisher =Elsevier|isbn= 978-1-4832-9754-5|pages=59–65}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are peripheral adjuncts to these four, such as the ''Unadisutras'', which focus on irregularly formed derivatives from the roots.&lt;ref name=Kiparsky59/&gt;

Sanskrit morphology is generally studied in two broad fundamental categories: the nominal forms and the verbal forms. These differ in the types of endings and what these endings mark in the grammatical context.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|pp=15-16}} Pronouns and nouns share the same grammatical categories, though they may differ in inflection. Verb-based adjectives and participles are not formally distinct from nouns. Adverbs are typically frozen case forms of adjectives, states Jamison, and "nonfinite verbal forms such as infinitives and gerunds also clearly show frozen nominal case endings".{{sfn|Jamison|2008|pp=15-16}}

===Tense and voice===
The Sanskrit language includes five tenses: present, future, past imperfect, past aorist and past perfect.&lt;ref name="Ruppel2017p34"/&gt; It outlines three types of voices: active, passive and the middle.&lt;ref name="Ruppel2017p34"/&gt; The middle is also referred to as the mediopassive, or more formally in Sanskrit as ''parasmaipada'' (word for another) and ''atmanepada'' (word for oneself).{{sfn|Jamison|2008|p=20}}

The paradigm for the tense-aspect system in Sanskrit is the three-way contrast between the "present", the "aorist" and the "perfect" architecture.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|p=21}} Vedic Sanskrit is more elaborate and had several additional tenses. For example, the ''Rigveda'' includes perfect and a marginal pluperfect. Classical Sanskrit simplifies the "present" system down to two tenses, the perfect and the imperfect, while the "aorist" stems retain the aorist tense and the "perfect" stems retain the perfect and marginal pluperfect.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|p=21}} The classical version of the language has elaborate rules for both voice and the tense-apsect system to emphasize clarity, and this is more elaborate than other Indo-European languages. The evolution of these systems can be seen from the earliest layers of the Vedic literature to the late Vedic literature.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|pp=20-21}}

===Gender, mood===
Sanskrit recognizes three numbers – singular, dual, and plural.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|pp=16-17}} The dual is a fully functioning category, used beyond naturally paired objects such as hands or eyes, extending to any collection of two. The elliptical dual is notable in the Vedic Sanskrit, according to Jamison, where a noun in the dual signals a paired opposition.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|pp=16-17}} Illustrations include ''dyāvā'' (literally, "the two heavens" for heaven-and-earth), ''mātarā'' (literally, "the two mothers" for mother-and-father).{{sfn|Jamison|2008|pp=16-17}} A verb may be singular, dual or plural, while the person recognized in the language are forms of "I", "you", "he/she/it", "we" and "they".&lt;ref name="Ruppel2017p34"/&gt;

There are three persons in Sanskrit: first, second and third.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|p=20}} Sanskrit uses the 3x3 grid formed by the three numbers and the three persons parameters as the paradigm and the basic building block of its verbal system.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|pp=20-21}}

The Sanskrit language incorporates three genders: feminine, masculine and neuter.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|pp=16-17}} All nouns have inherent gender, but with some exceptions, personal pronouns have no gender. Exceptions include demonstrative and anaphoric pronouns.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|pp=16-17}} Derivation of a word is used to express the feminine. Two most common derivations come from feminine-forming suffixes, the  ''-ā-'' (आ, Rādhā) and ''-ī-'' (ई, Rukmīnī). The masculine and neuter are much simpler, and the difference between them is primarily inflectional.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|pp=16-17}}{{sfn|Robert P. Goldman| Sally J Sutherland Goldman|2002|pp=59, 79, 91, 113}} Similar affixes for the feminine are found in many Indo-European languages, states Burrow, suggesting links of the Sanskrit to its PIE heritage.{{sfn|Thomas Burrow|2001|pp= 191-194}}

Pronouns in Sanskrit include the personal pronouns of the first and second persons, unmarked for gender, and a larger number of gender-distinguishing pronouns and adjectives.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|pp=19-20}} Examples of the former include ''ahám'' (first singular), ''vayám'' (first plural) and ''yūyám'' (second plural). The latter can be demonstrative, deictic or anaphoric.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|pp=19-20}} Both the Vedic and Classical Sanskrit share the ''sá/tám'' pronominal stem, and this is the closest element to a third person pronoun and an article in the Sanskrit language, states Jamison.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|pp=19-20}}

Indicative, potential and imperative are the three mood forms in Sanskrit.&lt;ref name="Ruppel2017p34"/&gt; 

===Prosody, meter===
{{main|Sanskrit prosody}}
The Sanskrit language formally incorporates [[Metre (poetry)|poetic metres]].&lt;ref name=jameslochtefeldsca140/&gt; By the late Vedic era, this developed into a field of study and it was central to the composition of the Hindu literature including the later Vedic texts. This study of Sanskrit prosody is called ''chandas'' and considered as one of the six [[Vedanga]]s, or limbs of Vedic studies.&lt;ref name=jameslochtefeldsca140&gt;James Lochtefeld (2002), "Chandas" in The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Hinduism, Vol. 1: A-M, Rosen Publishing, {{ISBN|0-8239-2287-1}}, page 140&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Moriz Winternitz|authorlink=Moriz Winternitz|title=A History of Indian Literature: Buddhist literature and Jaina literature|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Lgz1eMhu0JsC&amp;pg=PA577|year=1988|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|isbn=978-81-208-0265-0|page=577}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sanskrit prosody includes linear and non-linear systems.{{Sfn|Annette Wilke|Oliver Moebus|2011|pp=391-392 with footnotes}} The system started off with seven major metres, according to Annette Wilke and Oliver Moebus, called the "seven birds" or "seven mouths of Brihaspati", and each had its own rhythm, movements and aesthetics wherein a non-linear structure (aperiodicity) was mapped into a four verse polymorphic linear sequence.{{Sfn|Annette Wilke|Oliver Moebus|2011|pp=391-392 with footnotes}} A syllable in Sanskrit is classified as either ''laghu'' (light) or ''guru'' (heavy). This classification is based on a ''matra'' (literally, "count, measure, duration"), and typically a syllable that ends in a short vowel is a light syllable, while those that end in consonant, ''anusvara'' or ''visarga'' are heavy.

Meter and rhythm is an important part of the Sanskrit language. It may have played a role in helping preserve the integrity of the message and Sanskrit texts. The verse perfection in the Vedic texts such as the verse Upanishads{{refn|group=note|Kena, Katha, Isha, Shvetashvatara and Mundaka Upanishads are examples of verse-style ancient Upanishads.}} and post-Vedic Smriti texts are rich in prosody. This feature of the Sanskrit language led some Indologists from the 19th century onwards to identify suspected portions of texts where a line or sections are off the expected metre.&lt;ref name=olivelle1998xvi&gt;{{cite book|author=Patrick Olivelle| title=The Early Upanisads : Annotated Text and Translation| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Lsp18ZvstrcC| year=1998| publisher=Oxford University Press| isbn=978-0-19-535242-9| pages=xvi–xviii, xxxvii}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Olivelle2008p294"&gt;{{cite book|author=Patrick Olivelle|title=Collected Essays: Language, Texts and Society|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=P_Jx52VYRssC|year=2008|publisher=Firenze University Press|isbn=978-88-8453-729-4|pages=293–295}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=note|Sudden or significant changes in metre, wherein the metre of succeeding sections return to earlier sections, suggest a corruption of the message, interpolations and insertion of text into a Sanskrit manuscript.

The meter-feature of the Sanskrit language embeds another layer of communication to the listener or reader. A change in metres has been a tool of literary architecture and an embedded code to inform the reciter and audience that it marks the end of a section or chapter.&lt;ref name="TElizarenkova1995p112"/&gt; Each section or chapter of these texts uses identical metres, rhythmically presenting their ideas and making it easier to remember, recall and check for accuracy.&lt;ref name="TElizarenkova1995p112"/&gt; Authors coded a hymn's end by frequently using a verse of a metre different than that used in the hymn's body.&lt;ref name="TElizarenkova1995p112"/&gt; However, The Hindu tradition does not use the Gayatri metre to end a hymn or composition, possibly because it has enjoyed a special level of reverence in Hinduism.&lt;ref name="TElizarenkova1995p112"&gt;{{cite book|author=Tatyana J.

The early history of writing Sanskrit and other languages in ancient India is a problematic topic despite a century of scholarship, states [[Richard G. Salomon (academic)|Richard Salomon]] – an epigraphist and Indologist specializing in Sanskrit and Pali literature.{{sfn|Salomon|1998|p=10}} The earliest script from the Indian subcontinent is from the Indus Valley Civilization (3rd/2nd millennium BCE), but this script remains undeciphered. Of the Vedic period that appeared after the Indus Valley Civilization, if any scripts for Vedic Sanskrit existed, they have not survived. Scholars generally accept that Sanskrit originated in an oral society, and that an [[oral tradition]] preserved the extensive Vedic and Classical Sanskrit literature.{{sfn|Salomon|1998|pp=7-10, 86}} Other scholars such as Jack Goody state that the Vedic Sanskrit texts are not the product of an oral society, basing this view by comparing inconsistencies in the transmitted versions of literature from various oral societies such as the Greek, Serbian and other cultures, then noting that the Vedic literature is too consistent and vast to have been composed and transmitted orally across generations, without being written down.&lt;ref name="Goody1987p82"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jack Goody |title=The Interface Between the Written and the Oral  |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TepXQMN6lfUC |year=1987|publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-33794-6 |pages=110–121 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=lopez1995p21&gt;{{harvnb|Donald S. Lopez Jr. |1995|pp=21–47}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Lipi]]'' is the term in Sanskrit which means "writing, letters, alphabet". It contextually refers to scripts, the art or any manner of writing or drawing.{{sfn|Salomon|1998|p=11}} The term, in the sense of a writing system, appears in some of the earliest Buddhist, Hindu and Jaina texts. [[Pāṇini]]'s ''Astadhyayi'' composed sometime around the 5th- or 4th-century BCE, for example, mentions ''lipi'' in the context of a writing script and education system in his times, but he does not name the script.{{sfn|Salomon|1998|p=11}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author=Juhyung Rhi|year= 2009|journal= Journal of Central Eurasian Studies| volume= 1|title=On the Peripheries of Civilizations: The Evolution of a Visual Tradition in Gandhāra|pages=5, 1–13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Rita Sherma|author2=Arvind Sharma|title=Hermeneutics and Hindu Thought: Toward a Fusion of Horizons|url =https://books.google.com/books?id=x4eXRvwyvtMC |year=2008|publisher=Springer |isbn=978-1-4020-8192-7|page=235}};&lt;br&gt;{{cite book|author=Takao Hayashi|editor=Gavin Flood|title=The Blackwell Companion to Hinduism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SKBxa-MNqA8C|year=2008|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-0-470-99868-7|page=365}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several early Buddhist and Jaina texts, such as the ''[[Lalitavistara Sūtra]]'' and ''Pannavana Sutta'' include lists of numerous writing scripts in ancient India.{{refn|group=note|The Buddhist text ''[[Lalitavistara Sūtra]]'' describes the young Siddhartha – the future [[Buddha]] – to have mastered philology and scripts at a school from Brahmin Lipikara and Deva Vidyasinha.&lt;ref name=nado95&gt;Lopon Nado (1982), ''The Development of Language in Bhutan'', The Journal of the International Association of Buddhist Studies, Volume 5, Number 2, page 95, '''Quote''': "Under different teachers, such as the Brahmin Lipikara and Deva Vidyasinha, he mastered Indian philology and scripts. According to Lalitavistara, there were as many as sixty-four scripts in India."&lt;/ref&gt; The Buddhist texts list the sixty four ''lipi'' that the Buddha knew as a child, with the Brahmi script topping the list. "The historical value of this list is however limited by several factors", states Salomon. The list may be a later interpolation.{{sfn|Salomon|1998|pp=8-9 with footnotes}}{{refn|group=note|A version of this list of sixty-four ancient Indian scripts is found in the Chinese translation of an Indian Buddhist text, and this translation has been dated to 308 CE.{{sfn|Salomon|1998|pp=8-9}}}} The [[Jainism]] canonical texts such as the ''Pannavana Sutta'' – probably older than the Buddhist texts – list eighteen writing systems, with the Brahmi topping the list and Kharotthi (Kharoshthi) listed as fourth. The Jaina text elsewhere states that the "Brahmi is written in 18 different forms", but the details are lacking.{{sfn|Salomon|1998|pp=8-14}}}} However, the reliability of these lists has been questioned and the empirical evidence of writing systems in the form of Sanskrit or Prakrit inscriptions dated prior to the 3rd-century BCE has not been found. If the ancient surface for writing Sanskrit was palm leaves, tree bark and cloth – the same as those in later times, these have not survived.{{sfn|Salomon|1998|pp=8-14}}{{refn|group=note|The Greek [[Nearchus|Nearchos]] who visited ancient India with the army of [[Alexander the Great]] in the 4th-century BCE, mentions that Indians wrote on cloth, but Nearchos could have confused Aramaic writers with the Indians.{{sfn|Salomon|1998|pp=11-12}}}} According to Salomon, many find it difficult to explain the "evidently high level of political organization and cultural complexity" of ancient India without a writing system for Sanskrit and other languages.{{sfn|Salomon|1998|pp=8-14}}{{refn|group=note|Salomon writes, in ''The World's Writing Systems'' edited by Peter Daniels, that "many scholars feel that the origins of these scripts must have gone back further than this [mid-3rd century BCE Ashoka inscriptions], but there is no conclusive proof".{{sfn|Peter T. Daniels|1996|pp=371-372}}}}

The oldest datable writing systems for Sanskrit are the [[Brahmi script|Brāhmī script]], the related [[Kharosthi|Kharoṣṭhī script]] and the Brahmi derivatives.{{sfn|Peter T. Daniels|1996|pp=373-374, 376-378}}{{sfn|Salomon|1998|pp=14-16}} The Kharosthi was used in the northwestern part of the Indian subcontinent and it became extinct, while the Brahmi was used in all over the subcontinent along with regional scripts such as Old Tamil.{{sfn|Peter T. Daniels|1996|pp=373-375}} Of these, the earliest records in the Sanskrit language are in Brahmi, a script that later evolved into numerous related Indic scripts for Sanskrit, along with Southeast Asian scripts (Burmese, Thai, Lao, Khmer, others) and many extinct Central Asian scripts such as those discovered along with the Kharosthi in the Tarim Basin of western [[China]] and in [[Uzbekistan]].{{sfn|Peter T. Daniels|1996|pp=373-376}} The most extensive inscriptions that have survived into the modern era are the rock edicts and pillar inscriptions of the 3rd-century BCE Mauryan emperor [[Ashoka]], but these are not in Sanskrit.{{sfn|Peter T.

===Scripts===
Sanskrit is written very precisely, states Ruppel.{{sfn|A. M. Ruppel|2017|pp=9-10}} For every sound, it has one sign only, and each Sanskrit sign always represents the same sound. This phonetic aspect of Sanskrit distinguishes it from many of the world's languages.{{sfn|A. M. Ruppel|2017|pp=9-10}}{{refn|group=note|Sanskrit differs in this aspect from English, another Indo-European language. English has many ways of pronouncing the same letters. Ruppel gives the example of ''ough'' and the different ways it is pronounced  in ''thor'''ough''''', ''thr'''ough''''' and ''t'''ough'''''. English also represents the same sound with different letters. Ruppel gives the example of ''ea'' as in m'''''ea'''''l, th'''''ie'''''f , s'''''ee''''' and rec'''''ei'''''ve. This is not the case with Sanskrit, a language where unique sounds are precisely mapped to unique letters.{{sfn|A. M. Ruppel|2017|pp=9-10}}}} The basic graphic unit of Sanskrit is the ''aksara'', or syllable.{{sfn|Salomon|1998|pp=14-16}} All consonants are equal in Sanskrit and it does not have capital and small letters, such as the "A" and "a" in English.{{sfn|A. M. Ruppel|2017|pp=9-10}} However, vowels do not have an independent status in Sanskrit, unlike English and several other Indo-European languages. In Sanskrit, vowels co-exist with the consonants in order to achieve phonetic clarity. The Vedic Sanskrit hymn II.2.4 of the ''Aitereya Aranyaka'' explains the consonants to be the body of a verse, the vowels to be its soul (voice), and the sibilants as its breath.&lt;ref name="Magnus1999p31"&gt;{{cite book|author=Margaret Magnus|title=Gods of the Word: Archetypes in the Consonants|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=rIFsAAAAIAAJ| year=1999|publisher= Thomas Jefferson University Press|isbn= 978-0-943549-52-1 |page=31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Hartmut Scharfe|title=Grammatical Literature |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2_VbnWkZ-SYC |year=1977|publisher=Otto Harrassowitz Verlag|isbn=978-3-447-01706-0|pages=118 with footnote 15}}&lt;/ref&gt; This intimate relationship between the vowels and the consonants are embedded in the numerous writing scripts for the Sanskrit language.{{sfn|Salomon|1998|pp=14-16}}

====Brahmi script====
{{main article|Brahmi script}}
[[File:Hathibada Brahmi Inscription at Nagari, Hinduism Sanskrit India.jpg|thumb|upright=1.28|One of the oldest Hindu Sanskrit{{refn|group=note|Salomon states that the inscription has a few scribal errors, but is essentially standard Sanskrit.{{sfn|Salomon|1998|pp=86-87}}}} inscriptions, the broken pieces of this early 1st-century BCE [[Hathibada Ghosundi Inscriptions|Hathibada Brahmi Inscription]] were discovered in Rajasthan.

The Brahmi script for writing Sanskrit is a "modified consonant-syllabic" script. The graphic syllable is its basic unit, and this consists of a consonant with or without diacritic modifications.{{sfn|Salomon|1998|pp=14-16}} Since the vowel is an integral part of the consonants, and given the efficiently compacted, fused consonant cluster morphology for Sanskrit words and grammar, the Brahmi and its derivative writing systems deploy ligatures, diacritics and relative positioning of the vowel to inform the reader how the vowel is related to the consonant and how it is expected to be pronounced for clarity.{{sfn|Salomon|1998|pp=14-16}}{{sfn|Peter T. Daniels|1996|pp=376-380}}{{refn|group=note|Salomon illustrates this for the consonant ''ka'' which is written as "[[File:Brahmi k.svg|15px]]" in the Brahmi script and "क" in the Devanagari script, the vowel is marked together with the consonant before as in "कि", after "का", above "के" or below "कृ".{{sfn|Salomon|1998|pp=14-16}}}} This feature of Brahmi and its modern Indic script derivatives makes it difficult to classify it under the main script types used for the writing systems for most of the world's languages, namely logographic, syllabic and alphabetic.{{sfn|Salomon|1998|pp=14-16}}

The Brahmi script evolved into "a vast number of forms and derivatives", states Richard Salomon, and in theory, Sanskrit "can be represented in virtually any of the main Brahmi-based scripts and in practice it often is".{{sfn|Dhanesh Jain|George Cardona|2007|pp=69-70 in Chapter 3 by Salomon}} Sanskrit does not have a native script. Being a phonetic language, it can be written in any precise script that efficiently maps unique human sounds to unique symbols. From the ancient times, it has been written in numerous regional scripts in South and Southeast Asia. Most of these are descendants of the Brahmi script.{{sfn|Dhanesh Jain|George Cardona|2007|pp=68-72 in Chapter 3 by Salomon, Quote: "Sanskrit and the Prakrits, at different times and places were written in a vast number of forms and derivatives of Brahmi. In the premodern period, in other words, these languages would be written by a given scribe in whatever happened to be the current local script (...)" – Richard Salomon, page 70}} The earliest datable ''varnamala'' Brahmi alphabet system, found in later Sanskrit texts, is from the 2nd-century BCE, in the form of terracotta plaques found in [[Haryana]]. It shows a "schoolboy's writing lessons", states Salomon.{{sfn|Dhanesh Jain|George Cardona|2007|p=72 in Chapter 3 by Salomon}}&lt;ref&gt;{[cite journal|author = Bahadur Chand Chhabra| year=1970 | title=Sugh Terracotta with Brahmi Barakhadi|journal= Bull.

====Nagari script====
{{main article|Devanagari|Nandinagari|Nagari script}}
Many modern era manuscripts are written and available in the Nagari script, whose form is attestable to the 1st millennium CE.{{sfn|Dhanesh Jain|George Cardona|2007|pp=68-70 in Chapter 3 by Salomon}} The Nagari script is the ancestor of [[Devanagari]] (north India), [[Nandinagari]] (south India) and other variants. The Nāgarī script was in regular use by 7th century CE, and had fully evolved into Devanagari and Nandinagari&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.unicode.org/L2/L2013/13002-nandinagari.pdf Nandanagiri] Unicode Standards&lt;/ref&gt; scripts by about the end of the first millennium of the common era.&lt;ref name=kathleen&gt;Kathleen Kuiper (2010), The Culture of India, New York: The Rosen Publishing Group, {{ISBN|978-1615301492}}, page 83&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Richard Salomon (2014), Indian Epigraphy, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0195356663}}, pages 33-47&lt;/ref&gt; The Devanagari script, states Banerji, became more popular for Sanskrit in India since about the 18th-century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Sures Chandra Banerji|title=A Companion to Sanskrit Literature |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JkOAEdIsdUsC&amp;pg=PA672 |year=1989|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass |isbn=978-81-208-0063-2 |pages=671-672}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Sanskrit does have special historical connection to the Nagari script as attested by the epigraphical evidence.{{sfn|Dhanesh Jain|George Cardona|2007|pp=70, 75-77 in Chapter 3 by Salomon}} 

[[File:Phrase sanskrit.png|thumb|upright=1.35|Sanskrit in modern Indian and other Brahmi scripts: ''May [[Shiva|Śiva]] bless those who take delight in the language of the gods.'' ([[Kālidāsa]])]]
The Nagari script has been thought as a north Indian script for Sanskrit as well as the regional languages such as Hindi, Marathi and Nepali. However, it has had a "supra-local" status as evidenced by 1st-millennium CE epigraphy and manuscripts discovered all over India and as far as Sri Lanka, Burma, Indonesia and in its parent form called the Siddhamatrka script found in manuscripts of East Asia.{{sfn|Dhanesh Jain|George Cardona|2007|pp=75-77 in Chapter 3 by Salomon}} The Sanskrit and Balinese languages [[Sanur, Bali|Sanur]] inscription on [[Belanjong pillar]] of Bali (Indonesia), dated to about 914 CE, is in part in the Nagari script.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=John Norman Miksic|author2=Goh Geok Yian|title=Ancient Southeast Asia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zjklDwAAQBAJ|year=2016|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-1-317-27904-4|page=178}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Nagari script used for Classical Sanskrit has the fullest repertoire of characters consisting of fourteen vowels and thirty three consonants. For the Vedic Sanskrit, it has two more allophonic consonantal characters (the intervocalic ळ ''ḷa'', and ळ्ह ''ḷha'').{{sfn|Dhanesh Jain|George Cardona|2007|pp=75-77 in Chapter 3 by Salomon}} To communicate phonetic accuracy, it also includes several modifiers such as the ''anusvara'' dot and the ''visarga'' double dot, punctuation symbols and others such as the ''halanta'' sign.{{sfn|Dhanesh Jain|George Cardona|2007|pp=75-77 in Chapter 3 by Salomon}}

====Other writing systems====
Other scripts such as [[Gujarati alphabet|Gujarati]], [[Bengali alphabet|Bangla]], [[Odia alphabet|Odia]] and major south Indian scripts, states Salomon, "have been and often still are used in their proper territories for writing Sanskrit".{{sfn|Dhanesh Jain|George Cardona|2007|pp=68-70 in Chapter 3 by Salomon}} These and many Indian scripts look different to the untrained eye, but the differences between Indic scripts is "mostly superficial and they share the same phonetic repertoire and systemic features", states Salomon.{{sfn|Dhanesh Jain|George Cardona|2007|pp=70-78 in Chapter 3 by Salomon}} They all have essentially the same set of eleven to fourteen vowels and thirty-three consonants as established by the Sanskrit language and attestable in the Brahmi script. Further, a closer examination reveals that they all have the similar basic graphic principles, the same ''varnamala'' (literally, "garland of letters") alphabetic ordering following the same logical phonetic order, easing the work of historic skilled scribes writing or reproducing Sanskrit works across the Indian subcontinent.{{sfn|Dhanesh Jain|George Cardona|2007|pp=70-71, 75-76 in Chapter 3 by Salomon}}{{refn|group=note|Salomon states that these shared graphic principles that combine syllabic and alphabetic writing are distinctive for Indic scripts when contrasted with other major world languages. The only known similarity is found in the Ethiopic scripts, but Ethiopic system lacks clusters and the Indic set of full vowels signs.{{sfn|Dhanesh Jain|George Cardona|2007|pp=70-71 in Chapter 3 by Salomon}}}} The Sanskrit language written in some Indic scripts exaggerate angles or round shapes, but this serves only to mask the underlying similarities. Nagari script favours symmetry set with squared outlines and right angles. In contrast, Sanskrit written in the Bangla script emphasizes the acute angles while the neighbouring Odia script emphasizes rounded shapes and uses cosmetically appealing "umbrella-like curves" above the script symbols.{{sfn|Dhanesh Jain|George Cardona|2007|pp=72-73 in Chapter 3 by Salomon}}

In the south, where [[Dravidian languages]] predominate, scripts used for Sanskrit include the [[Kannada alphabet|Kannada]], [[Telugu script|Telugu]], [[Malayalam script|Malayalam]] and [[Grantha alphabet]]s.

=== Transliteration schemes, Romanisation ===
{{Main|Devanagari transliteration|International Alphabet of Sanskrit Transliteration}}
Since the late 18th century, Sanskrit has been [[transliteration|transliterated]] using the [[Latin alphabet]]. The system most commonly used today is the IAST ([[International Alphabet of Sanskrit Transliteration]]), which has been the academic standard since 1888. [[ASCII]]-based transliteration schemes have also evolved because of difficulties representing Sanskrit characters in computer systems. These include [[Harvard-Kyoto]] and [[ITRANS]], a transliteration scheme that is used widely on the Internet, especially in Usenet and in email, for considerations of speed of entry as well as rendering issues. With the wide availability of [[Unicode]]-aware web browsers, IAST has become common online. It is also possible to type using an [[alphanumeric keyboard]] and transliterate to Devanagari using software like Mac OS X's international support.

European scholars in the 19th century generally preferred Devanagari for the transcription and reproduction of whole texts and lengthy excerpts. However, references to individual words and names in texts composed in European Languages were usually represented with Roman transliteration. From the 20th century onwards, because of production costs, textual editions edited by Western scholars have mostly been in [[Romanised]] transliteration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://shashir.autodidactus.org/shashir_umich/sanskrit_transcription.html|title=Modern Transcription of Sanskrit|publisher=autodidactus.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides these few examples from the 1st century BCE, the earliest Sanskrit and hybrid dialect inscriptions are found in Mathura ([[Uttar Pradesh]]).{{sfn|Salomon|1998|p=87 with footnotes}} These date to the 1st and 2nd-century CE, states Salomon, from the time of the [[Northern Satraps|Saka Ksatrapas]] of the early [[Kushan Empire]].{{refn|group=note|According to Salomon, towards the end of pre-Christian era, "a smattering" of standard or nearly standard Sanskrit inscriptions came into vogue, and "we may assume that these are isolated survivals of what must have been then an increasingly common practice". He adds, that the Scythian rulers of northern and western India while not the originators, were promoters of the use of Sanskrit language for inscriptions, and "their motivation in promoting Sanskrit was presumably a desire to establish themselves as legitimate Indian or at least Indianized rulers and to curry the favor of the educated Brahmanical elite".{{sfn|Salomon|1998|p=93}}}} These are also in the Brahmi script.{{sfn|Salomon|1998|pp=87-88}} The earliest of these, states Salomon, are attributed to Ksatrapa [[Sodasa]] from the early years of 1st-century CE. Of the Mathura inscriptions, the most significant is the [[Mora Well Inscription]].{{sfn|Salomon|1998|pp=87-88}} In a manner similar to the Hathibada inscription, the Mora well inscription is a dedication inscription and is linked to the [[Vaishnavism]] tradition of Hinduism. It mentions a stone shrine (temple), pratima ([[murti]], images) and calls the five Vrishnis as ''bhagavatam''.{{sfn|Salomon|1998|pp=87-88}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Sonya Rhie Quintanilla|title=History of Early Stone Sculpture at Mathura: Ca. 150 BCE - 100 CE|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=X7Cb8IkZVSMC |year=2007|publisher=BRILL Academic|isbn=90-04-15537-6|page=260-263}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are many other Mathura Sanskrit inscriptions in Brahmi script overlapping the era of Indo-Scythian Northern Satraps and early Kushanas.{{sfn|Salomon|1998|pp=87-88}} Other significant 1st-century inscriptions in reasonably good classical Sanskrit in the Brahmi script include the [[Vasu Doorjamb Inscription]] and the [[Mountain Temple inscription]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Sonya Rhie Quintanilla|title=History of Early Stone Sculpture at Mathura: Ca. 150 BCE - 100 CE|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=X7Cb8IkZVSMC |year=2007|publisher=BRILL Academic|isbn=90-04-15537-6|page=260}}&lt;/ref&gt; The early ones are related to the Brahmanical, except for the inscription from [[Kankali Tila]] which may be Jaina, but none are Buddhist.{{sfn|Salomon|1998|p=88}}&lt;ref&gt;Inscription No21 in {{cite book |last1=Janert |first1=l |title=Mathura Inscriptions |date=1961 |url=https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.201093}}&lt;/ref&gt; A few of the later inscriptions from the 2nd-century CE include Buddhist Sanskrit, while others are in "more or less" standard Sanskrit and related to the Brahmanical tradition.{{sfn|Salomon|1998|pp=88-89}}

In [[Maharashtra]] and [[Gujarat]], Brahmi script Sanskrit inscriptions from the early centuries of the common era exist at the [[Nasik Caves]] site, near the Girnar mountain of Junagadh and elsewhere such as at [[Kanakerha inscription|Kanakhera]], [[Kanheri Caves|Kanheri]], and Gunda.{{sfn|Salomon|1998|pp=89-90}} The [[Nasik inscription of Ushavadata|Nasik inscription]] dates to the mid 1st century CE, is a fair approximation of standard Sanskrit and has hybrid features.{{sfn|Salomon|1998|pp=89-90}} The [[Junagadh rock inscription of Rudradaman|Junagadh rock inscription]] of [[Western Satraps]] ruler [[Rudradaman I]] (c. 150 CE, [[Gujarat]]) is the first long poetic-style inscription in "more or less" standard Sanskrit that has survived into the modern era. It represents a turning point in the history of Sanskrit epigraphy, states Salomon.{{sfn|Salomon|1998|p=89}}{{refn|group=note|The Rudradaman inscription is "not pure classical Sanskrit", but with few epic-vernacular Sanskrit exceptions, it approaches high classical Sanskrit.{{sfn|Salomon|1998|p=89}}}} Though no similar inscriptions are found for about two hundred years after the Rudradaman reign, it is important because its style is the prototype of the [[Prashasti|eulogy-style]] Sanskrit inscriptions found in the [[Gupta Empire]] era.{{sfn|Salomon|1998|p=89}} These inscriptions are also in the Brahmi script.&lt;ref name="Salomon 1998"&gt;{{harvnb|Salomon|1998|pp=10, 86-90}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The [[Nagarjunakonda]] inscriptions are the earliest known substantial South Indian Sanskrit inscriptions, probably from the late 3rd-century or early 4th-century CE, or both.{{sfn|Salomon|1998|pp=91-94}} These inscriptions are related to Buddhism and the [[Shaivism]] tradition of Hinduism.{{sfn|Salomon|1998|pp=90-91}} A few of these inscriptions from both traditions are verse-style in the classical Sanskrit language, while some such as the pillar inscription is written in prose and a hybridized Sanskrit language.{{sfn|Salomon|1998|pp=91-94}} An earlier hybrid Sanskrit inscription found on Amaravati slab is dated to the late 2nd-century, while a few later ones include Sanskrit inscriptions along with Prakrit inscriptions related to Hinduism and Buddhism.{{sfn|Salomon|1998|pp=90-91 with footnote 51}} After the 3rd-century CE, Sanskrit inscriptions dominate and many have survived.{{sfn|Salomon|1998|pp=91-93}} Between the 4th and 7th-century CE, south Indian inscriptions are exclusively in the Sanskrit language.{{sfn|Salomon|1998|p=92, Quote: "Finally, after this transitional period in the fourth and early fifth centuries AD, Prakrit fell out of use completely in southern Indian inscriptions. For the next few centuries Sanskrit was the sole epigraphic language, until the regional Dravidian languages began to come into use around the seventh century".}} In the eastern regions of the Indian subcontinent, scholars report minor Sanskrit inscriptions from the 2nd-century, these being fragments and scattered. The earliest substantial true Sanskrit language inscription of Susuniya ([[West Bengal]]) is dated to the 4th-century.{{sfn|Salomon|1998|p=92}} Elsewhere, such as Dehradun ([[Uttarakhand]]), inscriptions in more or less correct classical Sanskrit inscriptions are dated to the 3rd-century.{{sfn|Salomon|1998|p=92}} 

According to Salomon, the 4th-century reign of [[Samudragupta]] was the turning point when the classical Sanskrit language became established as the "epigraphic language par excellence" of the Indian world.{{sfn|Salomon|1998|pp=92-93}} These Sanskrit language inscriptions are either "donative" or "panegyric" records. Generally in accurate classical Sanskrit, they deploy a wide range of regional Indic writing systems extant at the time.{{sfn|Salomon|1998|pp=110-112, 132-148}} They record the donation of a temple or stupa, images, land, monasteries, pilgrim's travel record, public infrastructure such as water reservoir and irrigation measures to prevent famine. Others praise the king or the donor in lofty poetic terms.{{sfn|Salomon|1998|pp=110-126}} The Sanskrit language of these inscriptions is written on stone, various metals, terracotta, wood, crystal, ivory, shell and cloth.{{sfn|Salomon|1998|pp=126-132}}{{refn|group=note| The use of the Sanskrit language in epigraphy gradually dropped after the arrival and the consolidation of Islamic [[Delhi Sultanate]] rule in the late 12th-century, but it remained in active epigraphical use in the south and central regions of India. By about the 14th-century, with the Islamic armies conquering more of the Indian subcontinent, the use of Sanskrit language for inscriptions became rarer and it was replaced with Persian, Arabic, Dravidian and North-Indo-Aryan languages, states Salomon.{{sfn|Salomon|1998|pp=148-149}} The Sanskrit language, particularly in bilingual formet, re-emerged in the epigraphy of Hindu kingdoms such as the Vijayanagara, Yadavas, Hoysalas, Pandyas and others that re-established themselves.{{sfn|Salomon|1998|pp=149-150}} Some Muslim rulers such as Adil Shah also issued Sanskrit language inscriptions recording the donation of a mosque.{{sfn|Salomon|1998|pp=149-150}}}}

The evidence of the use of the Sanskrit language in Indic writing systems appears in southeast Asia in the first half of the 1st-millennium CE.{{sfn|Peter T. Daniels|1996| pp= 445-447 in the chapter by Christopher Court}} A few of these in Vietnam are bilingual where both the Sanskrit and the local language is written in the Indian alphabet. Early Sanskrit language inscriptions in Indic writing systems are dated to the 4th-century in Malaysia, 5th to 6th-century in Thailand near [[Si Thep]] and the Sak River, early 5th-century in Kutai (east [[Borneo]]) and mid 5th-century in west [[Java]] (Indonesia).{{sfn|Peter T. Daniels|1996| pp= 445-447 in the chapter by Christopher Court}} Both major writing systems for Sanskrit, the North Indian and South Indian scripts, have been discovered in southeast Asia, but the Southern variety with its rounded shapes are far more common.{{sfn|Peter T. Daniels|1996| pp= 445-456 in the chapter by Christopher Court}} The Indic scripts, particularly the [[Pallava script]] prototype,{{sfn|Peter T. Daniels|1996|pp= 446-448 in the chapter by Christopher Court}} spread and ultimately evolved into Mon-Burmese, Khmer, Thai, Laos, Sumatran, Celebes, Javanese and Balinese scripts.{{sfn|Colin P. Masica|1993|pp=137-144}}{{sfn|Mahadevan|2003}} From about the 5th-century, Sanskrit inscriptions become common in many parts of South Asia and Southeast Asia, with significant discoveries in Nepal, Vietnam and Cambodia.{{sfn|Salomon|1998|pp=92-93}}

== Influence on other languages ==
For nearly 2,000 years, Sanskrit was the language of a cultural order that exerted influence across [[South Asia]], [[Inner Asia]], [[Southeast Asia]], and to a certain extent [[East Asia]].&lt;ref name="Pollock 2001 pp. 392 – 426" /&gt; A significant form of post-Vedic Sanskrit is found in the Sanskrit of [[Indian epic poetry]]—the ''[[Ramayana]]'' and ''Mahabharata''. The deviations from {{IAST|[[Pāṇini]]}} in the epics are generally considered to be on account of interference from [[Prakrit]]s, or innovations, and not because they are pre-Paninian.&lt;ref name="Oberlies 2003"&gt;{{cite book|last=Oberlies|first=Thomas|title=A Grammar of Epic Sanskrit |publisher=Walter de Gruyter|location=Berlin New York|year=2003|isbn=3-11-014448-4|pages=xxvii–xxix}}&lt;/ref&gt; Traditional Sanskrit scholars call such deviations ''ārṣa'' (आर्ष), meaning 'of the [[rishi|ṛṣis]]', the traditional title for the ancient authors. In some contexts, there are also more "prakritisms" (borrowings from common speech) than in Classical Sanskrit proper. [[Buddhist Hybrid Sanskrit]] is a literary language heavily influenced by the [[Middle Indo-Aryan languages]], based on early Buddhist [[Prakrit]] texts which subsequently assimilated to the Classical Sanskrit standard in varying degrees.&lt;ref name="Edgerton 2004"&gt;{{cite book |last=Edgerton|first=Franklin|title=Buddhist Hybrid Sanskrit grammar and dictionary|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|location=Delhi|year=2004|isbn=81-215-1110-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sanskrit has greatly influenced the languages of India that grew from its vocabulary and grammatical base; for instance, [[Standard Hindi|Hindi]] is a "Sanskritised register" of [[Hindustani language|Hindustani]]. All modern [[Indo-Aryan languages]], as well as [[Munda languages|Munda]] and [[Dravidian languages]] have borrowed many words either directly from Sanskrit (''[[tatsama]]'' words), or indirectly via middle Indo-Aryan languages (''[[tadbhava]]'' words). Words originating in Sanskrit are estimated at roughly fifty percent of the vocabulary of modern Indo-Aryan languages, as well as the literary forms of [[Malayalam]] and [[Kannada language|Kannada]].{{sfn|Staal|1963|pp=261}} Literary texts in [[Telugu language|Telugu]] are [[Lexicon|lexically]] Sanskrit or Sanskritised to an enormous extent, perhaps seventy percent or more.&lt;ref name="Rao 2002 p.

=== Interaction with other languages ===
Buddhist Sanskrit has had a considerable influence on East Asian languages such as Chinese, state William Wang and Chaofen Sun.&lt;ref name="WangSun2015p5"/&gt; Many words have been adopted from Sanskrit into the Chinese, both in its historic religious discourse and everyday use.&lt;ref name="WangSun2015p5"&gt;{{cite book|author1=William S.-Y.

Sanskrit has also influenced [[Sino-Tibetan languages]], mostly through translations of [[Buddhist Hybrid Sanskrit]]. Many terms were transliterated directly and added to the Chinese vocabulary. Chinese words like {{lang|zh|剎那}} ''chànà'' ([[Devanagari]]: क्षण ''{{IAST|kṣaṇa}}'' 'instantaneous period') were borrowed from Sanskrit. Many Sanskrit texts survive only in Tibetan collections of commentaries to the Buddhist teachings, the [[Tengyur]].&lt;ref name="Gulik 2001"&gt;{{cite book|last=Gulik|first=R.

Sanskrit was a language for religious purposes and for the political elite in parts of medieval era Southeast Asia, Central Asia and East Asia.{{sfn|Michael C.

Sanskrit is the sacred language of various Hindu, Buddhist, and Jain traditions. It is used during worship in [[Hindu temple]]s. In [[Newar Buddhism]], it is used in all monasteries, while [[Mahayana]] and [[Tibetan Buddhist]] religious texts and sutras are in Sanskrit as well as vernacular languages. Some of the revered texts of Jainism including the [[Tattvartha sutra]], [[Ratnakaranda śrāvakācāra]], the [[Bhaktamara Stotra]] and the [[Jain Agamas|Agamas]] are in Sanskrit. Further, states [[Paul Dundas]], Sanskrit mantras and Sanskrit as a ritual language was commonplace among Jains throughout their medieval history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Paul Dundas|authorlink=Paul Dundas|editor=Jan E.

The [[Central Board of Secondary Education]] of India (CBSE), along with several other state education boards, has made Sanskrit an alternative option to the state's own official language as a second or third language choice in the schools it governs. In such schools, learning Sanskrit is an option for grades 5 to 8 (Classes V to VIII). This is true of most schools affiliated with the [[Indian Certificate of Secondary Education]] (ICSE) board, especially in states where the official language is [[Hindi]].

=== European studies and discourse ===
{{See also|Sanskrit studies}}

European scholarship in Sanskrit, begun by [[Heinrich Roth]] (1620–1668) and [[Johann Ernst Hanxleden]] (1681–1731), is considered responsible for the discovery of an Indo-European language family by [[William Jones (philologist)|Sir William Jones]] (1746–1794). This research played an important role in the development of Western [[philology]], or historical linguistics.&lt;ref name="Müller1859"&gt;{{cite book|author=Friedrich Max Müller|title=A History of Ancient Sanskrit Literature So Far as it Illustrates the Primitive Religion of the Brahmans|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6xUAAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA1|year=1859|publisher=Williams and Norgate|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 18th- and 19th-century speculations about the possible links of Sanskrit to ancient Egyptian language were later proven to be wrong, but it fed an orientalist discourse both in the form Indophobia and Indophilia, states Trautmann.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Thomas R. Trautmann |title=Aryans and British India|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dhbwDFfE9J8C&amp;pg=PA161| year=2004|publisher=Yoda Press |isbn=978-81-902272-1-6|page=73-84, 62-87}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sanskrit writings, when first discovered, were imagined by Indophiles to potentially be "repositories of the primitive experiences and religion of the human race, and as such confirmatory of the truth of Christian scripture", as well as a key to "universal ethnological narrative".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Thomas R. Trautmann |title=Aryans and British India|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dhbwDFfE9J8C&amp;pg=PA161| year=2004|publisher=Yoda Press |isbn=978-81-902272-1-6|page=96-97}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Indophobes imagined the opposite, making the counterclaim that there is little of any value in Sanskrit, portraying it as "a language fabricated by artful [Brahmin] priests", with little original thought, possibly copied from the Greeks who came with Alexander or perhaps the Persians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Thomas R. Trautmann |title=Aryans and British India|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dhbwDFfE9J8C&amp;pg=PA161| year=2004|publisher=Yoda Press |isbn=978-81-902272-1-6|page=124-126}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Scholars such as William Jones and his colleagues felt the need for systematic studies of Sanskrit language and literature. This launched the Asiatic Society, an idea that was soon transplanted to Europe starting with the efforts of [[Henry Thomas Colebrooke]] in Britain, then [[Alexander Hamilton (linguist)|Alexander Hamilton]] who helped expand its studies to Paris and thereafter his student Friedrich Schlegel who introduced Sanskrit to the universities of Germany. Schlegel nurtured his own students into influential European Sanskrit scholars, particularly through [[Franz Bopp]] and [[Friedrich Max Muller]]. As these scholars translated the Sanskrit manuscripts, the enthusiasm for Sanskrit grew rapidly among European scholars, states Trautmann, and chairs for Sanskrit "were established in the universities of nearly every German statelet" creating a competition for Sanskrit experts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Thomas R. Trautmann |title=Aryans and British India|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dhbwDFfE9J8C&amp;pg=PA161| year=2004|publisher=Yoda Press |isbn=978-81-902272-1-6|page=133-142}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Scientific modelling''' is a scientific activity, the aim of which is to make a particular part or feature of the world easier to [[Understanding|understand]], [[Definition|define]], [[quantification (science)|quantify]], [[Visual system|visualize]], or [[Simulation|simulate]] by referencing it to existing and usually commonly accepted [[knowledge]]. It requires selecting and identifying relevant aspects of a situation in the real world and then using different types of models for different aims, such as [[conceptual model]]s to better understand, operational models to [[operational definition|operationalize]], [[mathematical model]]s to quantify, and [[graphical model]]s to visualize the subject. Modelling is an essential and inseparable part of many scientific disciplines, each of which have their own ideas about specific types of modelling.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright, Nancy. 1983. ''How the Laws of Physics Lie''. Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hacking, Ian. 1983. ''Representing and Intervening. Introductory Topics in the Philosophy of Natural Science''. Cambridge University Press&lt;/ref&gt;

There is also an increasing attention to scientific modelling&lt;ref&gt;Frigg and [[Stephan Hartmann|Hartmann]] (2009) state: "Philosophers are acknowledging the importance of models with increasing attention and are probing the assorted roles that models play in scientific practice". Source: Frigg, Roman and [[Stephan Hartmann|Hartmann, Stephan]], "Models in Science", ''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' (Summer 2009 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), ([http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2009/entries/models-science/ source])&lt;/ref&gt; in fields such as [[science education]], [[philosophy of science]], [[systems theory]], and [[Visualization (graphics)#Knowledge visualization|knowledge visualization]]. There is growing collection of [[Scientific method|methods]], techniques and meta-[[theory]] about all kinds of specialized scientific modelling.

== Overview ==
[[File:MathModel.svg|right]]
A scientific model seeks to represent [[empiricism|empirical]] objects, phenomena, and physical processes in a [[logic]]al and [[Objectivity (philosophy)|objective]] way. All models are ''in simulacra'', that is, simplified reflections of reality that, despite being approximations, can be extremely useful.&lt;ref&gt;Box, George E.P. &amp; Draper, N.R. (1987). [Empirical Model-Building and Response Surfaces.] ''Wiley''. p. 424&lt;/ref&gt; Building and disputing models is fundamental to the scientific enterprise. Complete and true representation may be impossible, but scientific debate often concerns which is the better model for a given task, e.g., which is the more accurate climate model for seasonal forecasting.&lt;ref&gt;Hagedorn, R. ''et al.'' (2005) [http://www.ecmwf.int/staff/paco_doblas/abstr/tellus05_1.pdf, http://www.ecmwf.int/staff/paco_doblas/abstr/tellus05_1.pdf]{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} ''Tellus'' 57A:219–33&lt;/ref&gt;

Attempts to [[formal language|formalize]] the [[laws of science|principle]]s of the [[empirical science]]s use an [[interpretation (logic)|interpretation]] to model reality, in the same way logicians [[axiomatic system|axiomatize]] the [[rule of inference|principle]]s of [[logic]]. The aim of these attempts is to construct a [[formal system]] that will not produce theoretical consequences that are contrary to what is found in [[reality]]. Predictions or other statements drawn from such a formal system mirror or map the real world only insofar as these scientific models are true.&lt;ref name="tcarotmimanass"&gt;[[Leo Apostel]] (1961). "Formal study of models". In: ''The Concept and the Role of the Model in Mathematics and Natural and Social''. Edited by [[Hans Freudenthal]]. Springer. pp. 8–9 ([https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;id=8083fb2EuAMC&amp;dq=The+Concept+and+the+Role+of+the+Model+in+Mathematics+and+Natural+and+Social+Sciences&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=web&amp;ots=bF9aEC4e6L&amp;sig=iduhMF0ektNGV87_ZkwuY5thw0U#PPA8,M1 Source])]'',&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ritchey, T.  (2012) [http://www.amg.swemorph.com/pdf/amg-1-1-2012.pdf Outline for a Morphology of Modelling Methods: Contribution to a General Theory of Modelling]&lt;/ref&gt;

For the scientist, a model is also a way in which the human thought processes can be amplified.&lt;ref&gt;[[C. West Churchman]], ''The Systems Approach'', New York: Dell publishing, 1968, p. 61&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, models that are rendered in software allow scientists to leverage computational power to simulate, visualize, manipulate and gain intuition about the entity, phenomenon, or process being represented. Such computer models are ''in silico''. Other types of scientific models are ''in vivo'' (living models, such as [[laboratory rat]]s) and ''in vitro'' (in glassware, such as [[tissue culture]]).&lt;ref&gt;Griffiths, E. C. (2010) [https://sites.google.com/a/ncsu.edu/emily-griffiths/whatisamodel.pdf What is a model?]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Basics of scientific modelling ==

===Modelling as a substitute for direct measurement and experimentation===
Models are typically used when it is either impossible or impractical to create experimental conditions in which scientists can directly measure outcomes. Direct measurement of outcomes under [[Scientific control|controlled conditions]] (see [[Scientific method]]) will always be more reliable than modelled estimates of outcomes.

Within [[Modeling and simulation|modelling and simulation]], a model is a task-driven, purposeful simplification and abstraction of a perception of reality, shaped by physical, legal, and cognitive constraints.&lt;ref&gt;Tolk, A. (2015). Learning something right from models that are wrong – Epistemology of Simulation. In Yilmaz, L. (Ed.) ''Concepts and Methodologies in Modeling and Simulation.'' Springer–Verlag. pp. 87–106&lt;/ref&gt; It is task-driven, because a model is captured with a certain question or task in mind. Simplifications leave all the known and observed entities and their relation out that are not important for the task. Abstraction aggregates information that is important, but not needed in the same detail as the object of interest. Both activities, simplification and abstraction, are done purposefully. However, they are done based on a perception of reality. This perception is already a ''model'' in itself, as it comes with a physical constraint. There are also constraints on what we are able to legally observe with our current tools and methods, and cognitive constraints which limit what we are able to explain with our current theories. This model comprises the concepts, their behavior, and their relations in formal form and is often referred to as a [[conceptual model]]. In order to execute the model, it needs to be implemented as a [[computer simulation]]. This requires more choices, such as numerical approximations or the use of heuristics.&lt;ref&gt;Oberkampf, W. L., DeLand, S. M., Rutherford, B. M., Diegert, K. V., &amp; Alvin, K. F. (2002). Error and uncertainty in modeling and simulation. ''Reliability Engineering &amp; System Safety'' 75(3): 333–57.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite all these epistemological and computational constraints, simulation has been recognized as the third pillar of scientific methods: theory building, simulation, and experimentation.&lt;ref&gt;Ihrig, M. (2012). A New Research Architecture For The Simulation Era. In ''European Council on Modelling and Simulation''. pp. 715–20).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Simulation===
A [[simulation]] is the implementation of a model.  A steady state simulation provides information about the system at a specific instant in time (usually at equilibrium, if such a state exists).  A dynamic simulation provides information over time. A simulation brings a model to life and shows how a particular object or phenomenon will behave. Such a simulation can be useful for testing, analysis, or training in those cases where real-world systems or concepts can be represented by models.&lt;ref name="SEF"&gt;[http://www.dau.mil/pubs/pdf/SEFGuide%2001-01.pdf ''Systems Engineering Fundamentals.''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927203501/http://www.dau.mil/pubs/pdf/SEFGuide%2001-01.pdf |date=2007-09-27 }} Defense Acquisition University Press, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Structure===
[[Structure]] is a fundamental and sometimes intangible notion covering the recognition, observation, nature, and stability of patterns and relationships of entities. From a child's verbal description of a snowflake, to the detailed [[scientific analysis]] of the properties of [[magnetic field]]s, the concept of structure is an essential foundation of nearly every mode of inquiry and discovery in science, philosophy, and art.&lt;ref name="Pullan000"&gt;{{cite book | last = Pullan | first = Wendy | title = Structure | publisher = Cambridge University Press | location = Cambridge | year = 2000 | isbn = 0-521-78258-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Systems===
A [[system]] is a set of interacting or interdependent entities, real or abstract, forming an integrated whole. In general, a system is a construct or collection of different elements that together can produce results not obtainable by the elements alone.&lt;ref&gt;Fishwick PA. (1995). Simulation Model Design and Execution: Building Digital Worlds. Upper Saddle River, NJ: Prentice Hall.&lt;/ref&gt;  The concept of an 'integrated whole' can also be stated in terms of a system embodying a set of relationships which are differentiated from relationships of the set to other elements, and from relationships between an element of the set and elements not a part of the relational regime.  There are two types of system models: 1) discrete in which the variables change instantaneously at separate points in time and, 2) continuous where the state variables change continuously with respect to time.&lt;ref&gt;Sokolowski, J.A., Banks, C.M.(2009). Principles of Modelling and Simulation. Hoboken, NJ: John Wiley and Sons.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Generating a model===
Modelling is the process of generating a model as a conceptual representation of some phenomenon. Typically a model will deal with only some aspects of the phenomenon in question, and two models of the same phenomenon may be essentially different—that is to say, that the differences between them comprise more than just a simple renaming of components.

Such differences may be due to differing requirements of the model's end users, or to conceptual or aesthetic differences among the modellers and to contingent decisions made during the modelling process. Considerations that may influence the [[structure]] of a model might be the modeller's preference for a reduced [[ontology]], preferences regarding [[statistical model]]s versus [[Deterministic system|deterministic models]], discrete versus continuous time, etc. In any case, users of a model need to understand the assumptions made that are pertinent to its validity for a given use.

Building a model requires [[abstraction]].  Assumptions are used in modelling in order to specify the domain of application of the model. For example, the [[Special relativity|special theory of relativity]] assumes an [[inertial frame of reference]]. This assumption was contextualized and further explained by the [[general theory of relativity]]. A model makes accurate predictions when its assumptions are valid, and might well not make accurate predictions when its assumptions do not hold. Such assumptions are often the point with which older theories are succeeded by new ones (the [[General relativity|general theory of relativity]] works in non-inertial reference frames as well).

The term "assumption" is actually broader than its standard use, etymologically speaking. The [[Oxford English Dictionary]] (OED) and online Wiktionary indicate its Latin source as ''assumere'' ("accept, to take to oneself, adopt, usurp"), which is a conjunction of ''ad-'' ("to, towards, at") and ''sumere'' (to take). The root survives, with shifted meanings, in the Italian ''sumere'' and Spanish ''sumir''.  In the OED, "assume" has the senses of (i) “investing oneself with (an attribute), ” (ii) “to undertake” (especially in Law), (iii) “to take to oneself in appearance only, to pretend to possess,” and (iv) “to suppose a thing to be.” Thus, "assumption" connotes other associations than the contemporary standard sense of “that which is assumed or taken for granted; a supposition, postulate,” and deserves a broader analysis in the philosophy of science.{{Citation needed|date=April 2013}}

===Evaluating a model===
{{See also|Models of scientific inquiry#Choice of a theory}}
A model is evaluated first and foremost by its consistency to empirical data; any model inconsistent with reproducible observations must be modified or rejected. One way to modify the model is by restricting the domain over which it is credited with having high validity. A case in point is Newtonian physics, which is highly useful except for the very small, the very fast, and the very massive phenomena of the universe. However, a fit to empirical data alone is not sufficient for a model to be accepted as valid.  Other factors important in evaluating a model include:{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}
* Ability to explain past observations
* Ability to predict future observations
* Cost of use, especially in combination with other models
* Refutability, enabling estimation of the degree of confidence in the model
* Simplicity, or even aesthetic appeal
People may attempt to quantify the evaluation of a model using a [[utility function]].

===Visualization===
[[Visualization (computer graphics)|Visualization]] is any technique for creating images, diagrams, or animations to communicate a message. Visualization through visual imagery has been an effective way to communicate both abstract and concrete ideas since the dawn of man. Examples from history include [[cave painting]]s, [[Egyptian hieroglyphs]], Greek [[geometry]], and [[Leonardo da Vinci]]'s revolutionary methods of technical drawing for engineering and scientific purposes.

===Space mapping===
[[Space mapping]] refers to a methodology that employs a "quasi-global" modeling formulation to link companion "coarse" (ideal or low-fidelity) with "fine" (practical or high-fidelity) models of different complexities. In [[engineering optimization]], space mapping aligns (maps) a very fast coarse model with its related expensive-to-compute fine model so as to avoid direct expensive optimization of the fine model. The alignment process iteratively refines a "mapped" coarse model ([[surrogate model]]).

== Applications ==
===Modelling and simulation===

One application of scientific modelling is the field of [[modelling and simulation]], generally referred to as "M&amp;S".  M&amp;S has a spectrum of applications which range from concept development and analysis, through experimentation, measurement and verification, to disposal analysis.  Projects and programs may use hundreds of different simulations, simulators and model analysis tools.

* Gain insight of the scientific idea(s)
* Acquire deeper understanding of the subject through visualization of the model
* Improve student engagement in the course

Different types of model based learning techniques include:&lt;ref name=cambridgeref /&gt;
* Physical macrocosms
* Representational systems
* Syntactic models
* Emergent models

Model–making in education is an iterative exercise with students refining, developing and evaluating their models over time. This shifts learning from the rigidity and monotony of traditional curriculum to an exercise of students' creativity and curiosity. This approach utilizes the constructive strategy of social collaboration and learning scaffold theory. Model based learning includes cognitive reasoning skills where existing models can be improved upon by construction of newer models using the old models as a basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Nersessian|first1=Nancy J|title=The Cognitive Basis of Science|date=2002|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge, UK|isbn=0-521-01177-9|page=133}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Model–based learning entails determining target models and a learning pathway that provide realistic chances of understanding." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Clement|first1=JJ|last2=Rea-Ramirez|first2=Mary Anne|title=Model Based Learning and Instruction in Science|date=2008|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-1-4020-6493-7|page=45|edition=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Model making can also incorporate [[blended learning]] strategies by using web based tools and simulators, thereby allowing students to:
* Familiarize themselves with on-line or digital resources
* Create different models with various virtual materials at little or no cost
* Practice model making activity any time and any place
* Refine existing models

"A well-designed simulation simplifies a real world system while heightening awareness of the complexity of the system. Students can participate in the simplified system and learn how the real system operates without spending days, weeks or years it would take to undergo this experience in the real world." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Blumschein|first1=Patrick|last2=Hung|first2=Woei|last3=Jonassen|first3=David|last4=Strobel|first4=Johannes|title=Model-Based Approaches to Learning|date=2009|publisher=Sense Publishers|location=Netherlands|isbn=978-90-8790-711-2|url=https://www.sensepublishers.com/media/659-model-based-approaches-to-learning.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The teacher's role in the overall teaching and learning process is primarily that of a [[facilitator]] and arranger of the learning experience. He or she would assign the students, a model making activity for a particular concept and provide relevant information or support for the activity. For virtual model making activities, the teacher can also provide information on the usage of the digital tool and render troubleshooting support in case of glitches while using the same. The teacher can also arrange the group discussion activity between the students and provide the platform necessary for students to share their observations and knowledge extracted from the model making activity.

Model–based learning evaluation could include the use of [[Rubric (academic)|rubrics]] that assess the ingenuity and creativity of the student in the model construction and also the overall classroom participation of the student vis-a-vis the knowledge constructed through the activity.

It is important, however, to give due consideration to the following for successful model–based learning to occur:
* Use of the right tool at the right time for a particular concept
* Provision within the educational setup for model–making activity: e.g., computer room with internet facility or software installed to access simulator or digital tool

Nowadays there are some 40 magazines about scientific modelling which offer all kinds of international forums. Since the 1960s there is a strong growing number of books and magazines about specific forms of scientific modelling. There is also a lot of discussion about scientific modelling in the philosophy-of-science literature. A selection:

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11063">'''Sharon Dodua Otoo''' (born 1972) is a British writer, publicist and activist. In 2016 she was awarded the [[Festival of German-Language Literature|Ingeborg Bachmann Prize]] for her first short story in the German language.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/jul/12/black-british-writer-wins-major-german-language-fiction-sharon-dodue-otoo-ingeborg-bachmann-prize|title=Black British writer wins major German-language fiction award|last=Oltermann|first=Philip|date=2016-07-12|work=The Guardian|access-date=2017-03-03|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Sharon_Dodua_Otoo.jpg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Sharon_Dodua_Otoo.jpg|thumb|Sharon Dodua Otoo in 2016 after receiving the Ingeborg Bachmann Prize]]

== Life ==
Sharon Otoo was born in [[Ilford]], [[London]]. Her parents were both originally from [[Accra]], [[Ghana]], before moving to Ilford, London where Otoo was born and grew up. Otoo has two siblings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.munzinger.de/search/portrait/sharon+dodua+otoo/0/30795.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; After completing her schooling, she travelled to [[Hanover]] in 1992 where she stayed for a year to work as an au pair and developed an interest in the German language.

On her return Otoo studied German and Management Studies at [[Royal Holloway, University of London]], and graduated with a BA (Hons) in 1997. After graduating from Royal Holloway, Otoo returned to Germany where she has lived ever since, living in [[Berlin]] since 2006 with her four sons.

In an interview with ''[[The Guardian]]'' newspaper in 2016,  Otoo described herself as a “Black British mother, activist, author and editor” and spoke of having mixed feelings towards Britain. “I have a British passport and London is my home,” she said, “but there was still this something in the background music that said: ‘You don’t really belong here’.”&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Activism ==
As an activist Otoo has been involved with the Initiative for Black People in Germany (''Initiative Schwarze Menschen in Deutschland (ISD-Bund)''), serving on the board of directors between 2010 and 2013&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://isdonline.de/|title=Initiative Schwarze Menschen in Deutschland|website=Initiative Schwarze Menschen in Deutschland|language=de-DE|access-date=2017-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as a number of other groups. She edits the English-language book series ''Witnessed'' and has published numerous politically engaged articles on the subjects of culture, diversity and feminism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://witnessed-series.blogspot.co.uk/|title=Witnessed|website=witnessed-series.blogspot.co.uk|access-date=2017-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In her ''Guardian'' interview of 2016 she explained: “Politics can be very polarising and confrontational. With my writing, I would like to say: we can go out and demonstrate, but at the end of the day all we all want is to be understood and be treated with empathy.”&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Since 2014 she has worked as a project coordinator for the ''Regionale Arbeitsstelle Berlin'', an organisation which furthers the social integration and development of children of immigrant families from their early schooling up to professional training.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bag-raa.de/|title=RAA Homepage, bag, bag-raa, BAG, BAG der, RAA, RAA Bund, Bundes RAA, Eltern, Elternarbeit, Elternbeteiligung|website=www.bag-raa.de|language=de|access-date=2017-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Writing ==
Otoo’s first novella was entitled ''the things i am thinking while smiling politely'' [sic], published in February 2012 by Edition Assemblage, a small left-wing German publisher.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.edition-assemblage.de/|title=Edition Assemblage {{!}} Begleiterscheinungen emanzipatorischer Theorie und Praxis|website=www.edition-assemblage.de|language=de-DE|access-date=2017-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Otoo, Sharon Dodua (2012) the things i am thinking while smiling politely. Novella. Münster: Edition Assemblage. {{ISBN|978-3-942885-22-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was followed in 2014 by another novella ''Synchronicity''.&lt;ref&gt;Otoo, Sharon Dodua (2014) Synchronicity. Novella. Illustrated by Sita Ngoumou. Translated into German by Mirjam Nuenning. Münster: Edition Assemblage. {{ISBN|978-3-942885-74-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both works were originally written in English and translated into German by Mirjam Nuenning.

Otoo’s creative writing encompasses [[Magic realism|magical realism]], [[Afrofuturism]], identity issues, relationships and [[empowerment]]. She cites German-language writers such as [[Bertolt Brecht]] and [[Max Frisch]] as inspiration, for “combining sharp analysis of society with humour”, as well as [[Toni Morrison]] and [[Mildred D. Taylor|Mildred D Taylor]], “women writers who made the black experience in the US very tangible to me”.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== The Ingeborg Bachmann Prize 2016 ==
Otoo was invited to take part in the 2016 [[Festival of German-Language Literature|Ingeborg Bachmann Prize]] competition by ''[[Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung|Frankfurter Allgemeine]]'' editor Sandra Kegel.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://bachmannpreis.orf.at/stories/2783570/|title=Bachmann-Preis 2016 an Sharon Dodua Otoo - Bachmannpreis|website=bachmannpreis.orf.at|language=de|access-date=2017-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time Otoo said she was not aware of the prize’s significance in the German-speaking world. “That was probably a good idea,” she said , “otherwise I wouldn’t have submitted anything.”&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Otoo’s winning entry was “Herr Gröttrup setzte sich hin” (“Herr Gröttrup sat down”),&lt;ref&gt;Available in German as a pdf file, courtesy of ORF:http://files2.orf.at/vietnam2/files/bachmannpreis/201619/herr_grttrup_setzt_sich_hin_sharon_dodua_otoo_439620.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; the story of engineer and [[V-2 rocket|V2]] rocket-scientist [[Helmut Gröttrup]] and his wife Irmgard sitting down to breakfast. Herr Gröttrup’s breakfast egg takes over the narration and rebels against the orderly household by remaining soft despite being boiled for the regulation seven and a half minutes: and so commences a story hailed for its ‘changeling’ character, gentle satire and humour.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://bachmannpreis.orf.at/stories/2783570/|title=Bachmann-Preis 2016 an Sharon Dodua Otoo - Bachmannpreis|website=bachmannpreis.orf.at|language=de|access-date=2017-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The award was presented by the Mayor of [[Klagenfurt]], Maria Luise Mathiasschitz, who praised Otoo as “a new voice for a new society”. When questioned by ''The Guardian'' whether the award represented the jury’s desire to make a stand against the growing xenophobia and right-wing populism in Europe, Otoo said it might have played a part, “but I think in the end they voted for the quality of the story”.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The award has a prize of 25,000 Euros and Otoo has said that she intends to use the opportunity to write her first full-length novel.

'''''Shiksha''''' ({{lang-sa|शिक्षा}} [[IAST]]: {{IAST|śikṣā}}) is a Sanskrit word, which means "instruction, lesson, learning, study of skill".&lt;ref name=mmwsat1070&gt;Sir Monier Monier-Williams, [http://www.ibiblio.org/sripedia/ebooks/mw/1100/mw__1103.html Siksha], A DkSanskrit-English Dictionary: Etymologically and Philologically Arranged with Special Reference to Cognate Indo-European Languages, Oxford University Press (Reprinted: Motilal Banarsidass), {{ISBN|978-8120831056}}, page 1070&lt;/ref&gt;{{Sfn|Annette Wilke|Oliver Moebus|2011|pp=492-493 with footnotes}}&lt;ref name="Banerji1989p323"/&gt; It also refers to one of the six [[Vedanga]]s, or limbs of Vedic studies, on [[phonetics]] and [[phonology]] in [[Sanskrit]].&lt;ref name="Banerji1989p323"&gt;{{cite book|author=Sures Chandra Banerji|title=A Companion to Sanskrit Literature|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JkOAEdIsdUsC|year=1989|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass Publ.|isbn=978-81-208-0063-2|pages=323–324}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=jameslochtefeldsca629/&gt;

''Shiksha'' is the field of Vedic study of sound, focussing on the letters of the Sanskrit alphabet, accent, quantity, stress, melody and rules of euphonic combination of words during a Vedic recitation.&lt;ref name="Banerji1989p323"/&gt;{{Sfn|Annette Wilke|Oliver Moebus|2011|pp=477-495}} Each ancient Vedic school developed this field of ''Vedanga'', and the oldest surviving phonetic textbooks are the ''Pratishakyas''.{{Sfn|Annette Wilke|Oliver Moebus|2011|pp=492-493 with footnotes}} The ''Paniniya-Siksa'' and ''Naradiya-Siksa'' are examples of extant ancient manuscripts of this field of Vedic studies.&lt;ref name="Banerji1989p323"/&gt;{{Sfn|Annette Wilke|Oliver Moebus|2011|pp=477-495}}

''Shiksha'' is the oldest and the first auxiliary discipline to the [[Vedas]], maintained since the Vedic era.{{Sfn|Annette Wilke|Oliver Moebus|2011|pp=492-493 with footnotes}} It aims at construction of sound and language for synthesis of ideas, in contrast to grammarians who developed rules for language deconstruction and understanding of ideas.{{Sfn|Annette Wilke|Oliver Moebus|2011|pp=492-493 with footnotes}} This field helped preserve the Vedas and the Upanishads as the canons of [[Hinduism]] since the ancient times, and shared by various [[Hindu]] traditions.&lt;ref name="Scharfe1977p78"/&gt;{{Sfn|Guy L. Beck|1995|pp=35-36}}

==Etymology==
'''Shiksha''' literally means "instruction, lesson, study, knowledge, learning, study of skill, training in an art".&lt;ref name=mmwsat1070/&gt; It also refers to one of the six [[Vedanga]]s, which studies sound, Sanskrit phonetics, laws of euphonic combination (''sandhi''), and the science of making language pleasant and understood without mistakes.&lt;ref name=jameslochtefeldsca629/&gt; ''Shiksha'' as a supplemental branch of the [[Vedas]], included teaching proper articulation and pronunciation of Vedic texts.&lt;ref name=jameslochtefeldsca629&gt;James Lochtefeld (2002), "Shiksha" in The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Hinduism, Vol. 2: N-Z, Rosen Publishing, {{ISBN|0-8239-2287-1}}, page 629&lt;/ref&gt; It was one of six fields of supplemental studies, others being grammar (Vyakarana), prosody (Chandas), ritual (Kalpa), etymology (Nirukta) and astrology (Jyotisha, calculating favorable time for rituals).&lt;ref name=jameslochtefeldsca629/&gt;

The roots of ''Shiksha'' can be traced to the [[Rigveda]] which dedicates two hymns 10.125 and 10.71 to revere sound as a goddess, and links the development of thought to the development of speech.{{Sfn|Guy L. Beck|1995|pp=35-39}} The mid 1st-millennium BCE text [[Taittiriya Upanishad]] contains one of the earliest description of ''Shiksha'' as follows,

{{Quote|
&lt;poem&gt;
{{lang|sa|ॐ शीक्षां व्याख्यास्यामः ।
वर्णः स्वरः । मात्रा बलम् ।
साम सन्तानः । इत्युक्तः शीक्षाध्यायः ॥ १ ॥}}

Om! We will explain the Shiksha. 
Sounds and accentuation, Quantity (of vowels) and the expression (of consonants),
Balancing (Saman) and connection (of sounds), So much about the study of Shiksha. || 1 ||
&lt;/poem&gt;
|Taittiriya Upanishad 1.2, Shikshavalli|Translated by [[Paul Deussen]]&lt;ref&gt;Paul Deussen (1997 Reprint), Sixty Upanishads of the Veda, Volume 1, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120814684}}, page 222&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Banerji1989p323"/&gt;}}

Annette Wilke and Oliver Moebus date the Shiksha text of the Taittiriya Vedic school to be from 600 BCE at the latest.{{Sfn|Annette Wilke|Oliver Moebus|2011|p=477 with footnotes}} Texts such as this established, among other things, a rational order of the Sanskrit alphabet, state Wilke and Moebus.

The ancient Vedic schools developed major treatises analyzing sound, vowels and consonants, rules of combination and pronunciation to assist clear understanding, to avoid mistakes and for resonance (pleasing to the listener).{{Sfn|Annette Wilke|Oliver Moebus|2011|pp=477-493}} These texts include ''Samhita-pathas'' and ''Pada-pathas'', and partially or fully surviving manuscripts include ''Paniniya Shiksha'', ''Naradiya Shiksha'', ''Bharadvaja Shiksha'', ''Yajnavalkya Shiksha'', ''Vasishthi Shiksha'', ''Parashari Shiksha'', ''Katyayani Shiksha'' and ''Manduki Shiksha''.&lt;ref name="Banerji1989p323"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Kireet Joshi|title=The Veda and Indian Culture: An Introductory Essay|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1CJlM2nhlt0C&amp;pg=PA96|year=1991|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|isbn=978-81-208-0889-8|pages=96–97}}&lt;/ref&gt;

 |quote  = '''Speech and soul?'''
&lt;poem&gt;
Having intellectually determined the object to be communicated to others, the soul urges the mind in order to give expression, i.e., to vocalize the thought rising within. The mind so stimulated acts upon the physical fire which in its turn brings about a movement in the region of internal air. The internal air thus moved gets upward till it reaches the vocal apparatus.

''Shiksha'', states Hartmut Scharfe, was the first branch of linguistics to develop as an independent Vedic field of study among the Vedangas.&lt;ref name="Scharfe1977p78"/&gt; This is likely because Vedas were transmitted from one generation to the next by oral tradition, and the preservation and the techniques of preservation depended on phonetics, states Scharfe.&lt;ref name="Scharfe1977p78"&gt;{{cite book|author=Hartmut Scharfe|title=Grammatical Literature|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2_VbnWkZ-SYC&amp;pg=PA207|year=1977|publisher=Otto Harrassowitz Verlag|isbn=978-3-447-01706-0|pages=78–79}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest [[Brahmanas]] – a layer of text within the [[Vedas]], include some terms of art in the Vedic phonetics, such as ''Varna'' and ''Avasana''. The ''Shiksha'' field was likely well developed by the time [[Aranyaka]]s and [[Upanishad]]s layer of the Vedas were being composed.&lt;ref name="Scharfe1977p78"/&gt; The alphabet had been categorized by this time, into vowels (''svara''), stops (''sparsa''), semivowels (''antastha'') and spirants (''usman'').&lt;ref name="Scharfe1977p78"/&gt; The field was fundamental to the ancient study of linguistics, and it developed as an interest and inquiry into sounds rather than letters.&lt;ref name="Scharfe1977p78"/&gt; ''Shiksha'', as described in these ancient texts, had six chapters - ''varna'' (sound), ''svara'' (accent), ''matra'' (quantity), ''bala'' (strength, articulation), ''saman''(recital) and ''samtana'' (connection between preceding and following sounds).&lt;ref name="Scharfe1977p78"/&gt;

The insights from this field, states Scharfe, "without doubt was applied by Vedic scholars to the art of writing". It also impacted the development of Indic scripts and evolution of language in countries that sought Indian texts or were influenced by Indian religions.&lt;ref name="Scharfe1977p78"/&gt; According to Scharfe, and other scholars, the insights developed in this field, over time, likely also influenced phonetic scripts in parts of East Asia, as well as Arabic grammarian Halil in 8th-century CE.&lt;ref name="Scharfe1977p80"&gt;{{cite book|author=Hartmut Scharfe|title=Grammatical Literature|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2_VbnWkZ-SYC&amp;pg=PA207|year=1977|publisher=Otto Harrassowitz Verlag|isbn=978-3-447-01706-0|pages=79–80}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hans Jensen (1969), Sign, Symbol and Script, 3rd Edition, Putnam Publishers, {{ISBN|978-0044000211}},  Chapter: ''On the influence of Sanskrit upon phonetic studies in Chinese and Japanese''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discussion==
{{Quote box
 |quote  = '''Shiksha and the Sanskrit alphabet'''
&lt;poem&gt;
A strictly symmetrical [Sanskrit] alphabet definitely has practical advantages in language teaching, but this is almost certainly not the reason for its highly complex structure. (...) A better explanation of the structural density is the striving for perfect and beautifully formed representation of the object of study. The rule of the grammarians show a similar striving for order.
&lt;/poem&gt;

The ''Shiksha'' field of Vedic studies arranged the Sanskrit alphabet in a rational order, state Wilke and Moebus, each mapped to the anatomical nature of human sounds, from the back to the front - throat (at the very back), palate, palatal ridge, teeth and lips.{{Sfn|Annette Wilke|Oliver Moebus|2011|p=478}} The letters of the Sanskrit alphabet were further organized by the Vedic scholars into a magic square, making symmetrical and resonant alternate readings of the letters possible, such as top to bottom in addition to left to right.{{Sfn|Annette Wilke|Oliver Moebus|2011|pp=478-479}} Further, the ''Shiksha'' scholars added ''Mudra'' (hand signs) to go with each sound, thereby providing a visual confirmation and an alternate means to check the reading integrity by the audience, in addition to the audible means.{{Sfn|Annette Wilke|Oliver Moebus|2011|p=479}}

These Mudras continue to be part of the classical Indian dance tradition.{{Sfn|Annette Wilke|Oliver Moebus  |2011|pp=479-480}} This interplay of the gesture and sound in Sanskrit recital, state Wilke and Moebus, is similar to the gesture of a conductor and the sound produced by music players in any classical orchestra.{{Sfn|Annette Wilke|Oliver Moebus|2011|p=480}} In Sanskrit, the posture of the performer is an added dimension to those of pronunciation and gesture, together these empowered muscular memory with acoustic memory in the Hindu tradition of remembering and transmitting Sanskrit texts from one generation to the next, state Wilke and Moebus.{{Sfn|Annette Wilke|Oliver Moebus|2011|p=480}}

The methodical phonetic procedure developed by ''Shiksha'' helped preserve the Vedas without the slightest variants in the most faithful way possible.{{Sfn|Annette Wilke|Oliver Moebus|2011|p=495}} It made the Vedas and embedded Principal Upanishads the canonical scriptures of Hinduism. The rules and symmetric of Siksa helped the student to master enormous volumes of knowledge, and use the embedded codes and rules to self check his memory.{{Sfn|Annette Wilke|Oliver Moebus|2011|p=495}}

However, state Wilke and Moebus, the Shiksha methodology has been not just highly technical, it has strong aesthetic "sensuous, emotive" dimension, which foster thinking and intellectual skills in a participatory fashion.{{Sfn|Annette Wilke|Oliver Moebus|2011|p=499}} The reciter's mind and body are engaged, making language and sound as an emotional performance.{{Sfn|Annette Wilke|Oliver Moebus|2011|p=499}} The study of phonetics functioned to transform a Vedic text, which traditionally was composed as language-music, into a musical performance.{{Sfn|Annette Wilke|Oliver Moebus|2011|pp=500-501}} Individual sounds in the Sanskrit have independent personalities, and the reciter helps develop their character and their timbre, state Wilke and Moebus. Naradiya Siksa, a phonetics treatise on the [[Sama Veda]] explains this aspects of phonology with various similes, such as,

{{Quote|
Just as a tigress takes her cubs tightly in her teeth without hurting them, whilst fearing that she might drop them and injure them, so one should approach the individual syllables.
|Naradiya Siksa 2.8.31|Translated by Annette Wilke and Oliver Moebus,{{Sfn|Annette Wilke|Oliver Moebus|2011|p=500}}}}

===Pratishakhyas===
Pratisakhyas are the oldest ''Siksa'' textbooks of each branch of the Vedas.{{Sfn|Annette Wilke|Oliver Moebus|2011|p=492}} Later Siksa texts are more specialized and systematic, and often titled with suffix "Siksa", such as the Naradiya-Siksa, Vyasa-Siksa, Pari-Siksa and Sarvasammata-Siksa.{{Sfn|Annette Wilke|Oliver Moebus|2011|pp=492-493}}

The [[Pratisakhya|Pratishakhyas]], which evolved from the more ancient Vedic Texts [[padapatha]]s (''{{IAST|padapāṭha}}'') around 800 BCE, deal with the manner in which the Vedas are to be enunciated. There are separate Pratishakhyas for each Veda. They complement the books called Shiksha written by various authorities. Several Pratishakhyas have survived into the modern era, and these texts refine the structure of sound at different levels of nuance, some adding many more letters to the basic set in the Sanskrit alphabet:&lt;ref name=egenesp152&gt;{{cite book|author=Thomas Egenes|title=Introduction to Sanskrit|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZAu6xhfb4bUC&amp;pg=PA152|year=1996|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|isbn=978-81-208-1693-0|pages=152–154}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Shukla Yajurveda]]-Pratishakhya: 65 letters&lt;ref name=egenesp152/&gt;
* [[Taittiriya]] (Krishna Yajurveda) Pratishakhya: 52 letters&lt;ref name=egenesp152/&gt;
* [[Atharvaveda]]-Pratishakhya (Shaunakiya shakha)
* [[Samaveda]]-Pratishakhya (Rig-tantra): 57 letters (Pushpasutra is the second Pratishakhya of Samaveda)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=Kireet Joshi| title=The Veda and Indian Culture: An Introductory Essay| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1CJlM2nhlt0C| year=1991| publisher=Motilal Banarsidass| isbn=978-81-208-0889-8| page=103}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Paniniya-Siksa: 63 or 64 letters&lt;ref name=egenesp152/&gt;

The Shiksha Texts and the Pratishakhyas led to great clarity in understanding the surface structure of language. For clarity of pronunciation, they broke up the large Vedic [[compound word|compound]]s into [[word stem]]s, prefixes, and suffixes. Certain styles of recitation (''{{IAST|pāṭha}}''), such as the ''{{IAST|jaṭāpāṭha}},'' involved switching syllables, repeating the last word of a line at the beginning of the next, and other permutations. In the process, a considerable amount of [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]] is discussed, particularly regarding the combination of sequential sounds, which leads to the modalities of [[sandhi]]. The Samaveda Pratishakhya, one of the earliest,&lt;ref&gt;Staal, J. F., ''The Fidelity of Oral Tradition and the Origins of Science''. North-Holland Publishing Company, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt; organizes the [[stop consonant]] sounds into a 5x5 ''varga'' or square:

{| class="wikitable" align=center style = " background: transparent; "

|}

The alphabet is designed such that the difference between sounds is preserved whether you recite it horizontally or vertically. It was extended and completed with [[fricative]]s and [[sibilant]]s, [[semi-vowel]]s, and [[vowel]]s, and was eventually codified into the [[Brahmi alphabet]], which is one of the most systematic sound-to-writing mappings. Scholar Frits Staal has commented, "Like Mendelejev’s Periodic System of Elements, the varga system was the result of centuries of analysis. In the course of that development the basic concepts of phonology were discovered and defined.&lt;ref&gt;Frits Staal, ''The science of language'', Chapter 16 in [[Gavin Flood]], The Blackwell Companion to Hinduism [[Blackwell Publishing]], 2003, 599 pages {{ISBN|0-631-21535-2}}, p. 352.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Varga system and the Pratishakshyas, contributions of the Shiksha texts, are elaborate systems which deal with the generation and classification of sound.

===Other Shiksha texts===
{{refimprove section|date=March 2016}}
In addition, several Shiksha texts exist, most of them in metrical verse form but a few in sutra form. The following list contains some of these surviving texts (English translation of Paniniya Siksa.pdf): Amoghanandini Shiksha, Apisali Shiksha (in sutra form), Aranya Shiksha, Atreya Shiksha, Avasananirnyaya Shiksha, Bharadvaja Shiksha, Chandra Shiksha of Chandragomin (sutra form), Charayaniya Shiksha, Galadrka Shiksha,  Kalanirnya Shiksha, Katyayani Shiksha, Kaundinya Shiksha, Keshavi Shiksha, Kramakarika Shiksha, Kramasandhaana Shiksha, Laghumoghanandini Shiksha, Lakshmikanta Shiksha, Lomashi Shiksha, Madhyandina Shiksha, Mandavya Shiksha, Mallasharmakrta Shiksha, Manasvaara Shiksha, Manduki Shiksha, Naradiya Shiksha, Paniniya Shiksha (versified), Paniniya Shiksha (in sutra form), Paniniya Shiksha (with accents), Parashari Shiksha, Padyaatmika Keshavi Shiksha, Pari Shiksha, Pratishakhyapradipa Shiksha, Sarvasammata Shiksha, Shaishiriya Shiksha, Shamaana Shiksha, Shambhu Shiksha, Shodashashloki Shiksha, Shikshasamgraha, Siddhanta Shiksha, Svaraankusha Shiksha, Svarashtaka Shiksha, Svaravyanjana Shiksha, Vasishtha Shiksha, Varnaratnapradipa Shiksha, Vyaali Shiksha, Vyasa Shiksha, Yajnavalkya Shiksha

Although many of these Shiksha texts are attached to specific Vedic schools, others are late texts.

==Sound and alphabet==
{{refimprove section|date=March 2016}}
Traditionally [[syllables]] (not letters) in Sanskrit are called [[Aksara|''Akshara'']], meaning "imperishable (entity)": "atoms" of speech, as it were. These aksharas are classified mainly into two types:&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;"Siddhanta Kaumudi" by Bhattoji Diksita and "Laghu Siddhanta Kaumudi", by Varadaraja.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Svara''' ([[Shiva Sutra|pratyahara]] ''aC''): [[Vowel]]
* '''Vyanjana''' (pratyahara ''haL''): [[Consonant]]

''Svara aksharas'' are also known as ''prana akshara''; i.e., they are main sounds in speech, without which speech is not possible. [[Pāṇini]] referred to ''svara'' as ''ac pratyahara''. Later they became known as ''ac Akshara''.

''Vyanjana'' means embellishment, i.e., consonants are used as embellishment in order to yield [[sonorant]] vowels. They are also known as ''Prani akshara''; that is, they are like a body to which life (''svara'') is added.  Pāṇini's name for ''vyanjana'' was ''Hal Pratyahara'', which were later referred to as ''Hal akshara''.

''Vyanjana aksharas'' are divided into three types:
** '''Sparsa''': [[Stop consonant|Stop]]
** '''Antastha''': [[Approximant]]
** '''Usman''': [[Sibilant]]
Sparsa aksharas include syllables from ''ka'' to ''ma''; they are 25 in number. Antastha aksharas include syllables ''ya'', ''ra'', ''la'' and ''va''. Usman aksharas include ''śa'', ''ṣa'', ''sa'' and ''ha''.

===Vowels===
{{main|Vedic accent}}
Each vowel can be classified into three types based on the duration of pronunciation (''[[morae]]''):
* '''Hrasva''': [[Short vowel]], Eka-mātra
* '''Dīrgha''': [[Long vowel]], Dvi-mātra
* '''{{IAST|Pluta}}''': Prolonged vowel, Tri-mātra ([[pluti|{{IAST|pluti}}]])
We see that each vowel can be pronounced in three ways according to the duration of articulation.
The unit of time is a ''mātra'' (approx. 0.4 seconds).

Each vowel can be further classified into two types based on the manner of pronunciation:
: '''Mukha''': [[Oral vowel|Oral]] (open)
: '''Nāsika''': [[Nasal vowel|Nasal]] (all vowels are considered phonemically oral)

Each vowel can also be classified into three types, that is, pronounced in three ways, based on accent of articulation. This feature was lost in [[Classical Sanskrit]], but used in reciting [[Vedas|Vedic]] and [[Upanishad]]ic [[hymn]]s and [[mantra]]s.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}
: '''Udātta''': high pitch
: '''Anudātta''': low pitch
: '''Svarita''': descending pitch (usually follows high pitch)

===Articulation===
Generally, in [[articulatory phonetics]], the [[place of articulation]] (or ''point of articulation'') of a consonant is the point of contact, where an obstruction occurs in the vocal tract between an active (moving) articulator (typically some part of the tongue) and a passive (stationary) articulator (typically some part of the roof of the mouth).{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

But according to Indian linguistic tradition,&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; there are five ''passive'' places of articulation:
: '''{{IAST|Kaṇṭhya}}''': [[Velar consonant|Velar]]
: '''Tālavya''': [[Palatal consonant|Palatal]]
: '''Mūrdhanya''': [[Retroflex consonant|Retroflex]]
: '''Dantya ''': [[Dental consonant|Dental]]
: '''Ōṣṭhya ''': [[Labial consonant|Labial]]

Apart from that, other articulations are combinations of the above five places:{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}
: '''Dant'oṣṭhya''': [[Labio-dental]] (E.g.: v)
: '''Kantatālavya''': e.g.: [[Diphthong]] e
: '''Kaṇṭōṣṭhya''': labial-velar (E.g.: Diphthong o)

There are three ''active'' places of articulation:
: '''Jihvāmūla''': [[dorsal consonant|tongue root]], for [[velar]]
: '''Jihvāmadhya''': [[laminal|tongue body]], for [[palatal]]
: '''Jihvāgra''': [[Apical consonant|tip of tongue]], for [[Retroflex consonant|cerebral]] and [[Dental consonant|dental]]
: '''{{IAST|Adhōṣṭha}}''': [[lower lip]], for [[Labial consonant|labial]]

Effort (or [[Manner of articulation|manner]]) of articulation ('''{{IAST|Uccāraṇa Prayatna}}''') is of two types for consonants,{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}
: '''Bāhya Prayatna''': External effort
:: '''{{IAST|Spṛṣṭa}}''': [[Plosive]]
:: '''{{IAST|Īshat Spṛṣṭa}}''': [[Approximant]]
:: '''{{IAST|Īshat Saṃvṛta}}''': [[Fricative]]
: '''Abhyantara Prayatna''': Internal effort
:: '''Alpaprāna''': [[Unaspirated]]
:: '''Mahāprāna''': [[Aspiration (phonetics)|Aspirated]]
:: '''Śvāsa''': [[Unvoiced]]
:: '''Nāda''': [[Voiced]]

===Articulation of consonants===
Articulation of consonants will be a logical combination of components in the two prayatnas.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} The below table gives a view upon articulation of consonants.

[[File:Entfuhrung aus dem Serail484.jpg|thumb|[[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]] (center) attending a performance of his Singspiel, ''[[Die Entführung aus dem Serail]]'', in Berlin in 1789]]
A '''Singspiel''' ({{IPA-de|ziŋɡʃpiːl}}; plural: Singspiele; literally "sing-play") is a form of German-language music drama, now regarded as a genre of [[opera]].&lt;ref&gt;According to the 1908 edition of ''[[Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians|Grove's Dictionary of Music]]'', the main distinction between [[opera]] and Singspiel is: "[Singspiel] by no means excludes occasional [[recitative]] in place of the spoken dialogue, but the moment the music helps to develop the dramatic denouement we have to do with Opera and not with Singspiel."&lt;/ref&gt; It is characterized by spoken [[dialogue]], which is alternated with [[Musical ensemble|ensembles]], [[song]]s, [[ballad]]s, and [[aria]]s which were often [[Strophic form|strophic]], or folk-like. Singspiel plots are generally comic or romantic in nature, and frequently include elements of [[magic (paranormal)|magic]], fantastical creatures, and comically exaggerated characterizations of good and evil.
__TOC__

==History==
Some of the first Singspiele were [[Mystery play|miracle play]]s in Germany, where dialogue was interspersed with singing. By the early 17th century, miracle plays had grown profane, the word "Singspiel" is found in print,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?lr=&amp;num=100&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;output=html&amp;as_brr=0&amp;q=Singspiel+OR+Singspiele&amp;btnG=Search+Books&amp;as_drrb_is=b&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=1600&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=1680 |title=GoogleBooks search result for "Singspiel"' 1600–1680 |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2014-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; and secular Singspiele were also being performed, both in translated borrowings or imitations from English and Italian songs and plays, and in original German creations.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Alexander Fuller Maitland|Maitland, J. A. Fuller]], ed. [https://books.google.com/books?id=FBsPAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA468&amp;dq=Singspiel+OR+Singspiele&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=b&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=1900&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=1940&amp;num=100&amp;as_brr=0&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;output=html ''Grove's Dictionary of Music and Musicians'', Vol. IV.] London: MacMillan and Co., 1908. pp. 468–470.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 18th century, some Singspiele were translations of English [[ballad opera]]s. In 1736, the [[Prussia]]n ambassador to England commissioned a translation of the ballad opera ''The Devil to Pay''. This was successfully performed in the 1740s in Hamburg and Leipzig. A further version of this was made by [[Johann Adam Hiller]] and [[Christian Felix Weiße|C. F. Weiße]] in 1766 (''[[Die verwandelten Weiber|Der Teufel ist los oder Die verwandelten Weiber]]''), the first of a string of such collaborations which led to Hiller and Weisse being called "the fathers of the German Singspiel."&lt;ref&gt;''[[Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians]]'' (1980 edition), "Ballad opera."&lt;/ref&gt;

French operas with spoken dialogue (''[[opéra comique|opéras comiques]]'') were frequently transcribed into the German and became very successful in Vienna in the late 1770s and early 1780s. By contrast, German translations of contemporary Italian ''[[opera buffa|opere buffe]]'', which were quite successful in England and France at the time, were significantly less frequent. Singspiele were considered middle-to-lower class [[entertainment]] – as opposed to the predominantly aristocratic genres of opera, ballet and stage play – and were usually performed by traveling [[Wikt:troupe|troupe]]s (such as the Koch, Döbbelin and Koberwein companies), rather than by established companies within metropolitan centers.

[[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]] wrote several Singspiele: ''[[Bastien und Bastienne]]'' (1768), ''[[Zaide]]'' (1780), ''[[Die Entführung aus dem Serail]]'' (1782), ''[[Der Schauspieldirektor]]'' (1786), and finally ''[[The Magic Flute|Die Zauberflöte]]'' (1791). [[E. T. A. Hoffmann]], who admired him, composed Singspiele, such as ''[[Liebe und Eifersucht]]'' in 1807.

In 1927, [[Kurt Weill]] created a new word, "Songspiel", to describe his work ''[[Mahagonny-Songspiel]]''.

This temporary transformation of a street is a type of tactical urbanism.]]

'''Tactical urbanism''' is an umbrella term used to describe a collection of low-cost, temporary changes to the [[built environment]], usually in cities, intended to improve local neighbourhoods and city gathering places.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pfeifer|first1=Laura|title=The Planner's Guide to Tactical Urbanism|url=http://reginaurbanecology.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/tuguide1.pdf|website=Regina Urban Ecology|publisher=Regina Urban Ecology|accessdate=23 October 2014}} Tactical urbanism is often citizen-led but can also be initiated by government entities.&lt;/ref&gt; Tactical urbanism is also commonly referred to as guerilla urbanism, pop-up urbanism, city repair, or D.I.Y. urbanism.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lydon|first1=Mike|last2=Bartman|first2=Dan|last3=Garcia|first3=Tony|last4=Preston|first4=Russ|last5=Woudstra|first5=Ronald|title=Tactical Urbanism Short-term Action Long-term Change Volume 2|date=March 2012|publisher=The Street Plans Collaborative|url=http://issuu.com/streetplanscollaborative/docs/tactical_urbanism_vol_2_final?e=4528751/2585800|accessdate=23 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Definition ==
The Street Plans Collaborative defines "tactical urbanism" as an approach to urban change that features the following five characteristics:&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; 
# A deliberate, phased approach to instigating change;
# The offering of local solutions for local planning challenges;
# Short-term commitment and realistic expectations;
# Low-risks, with a possibly high reward; and
# The development of social capital between citizens and the building of organizational capacity between public-private institutions, non-profits, and their constituents.

== Origin ==
The term was coined circa 2010 to describe a range of existing techniques. It is attributed to New York-based urban planner Mike Lydon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/innovation/tactical-urbanists-are-improving-cities-one-rogue-fix-at-a-time-180955049/?no-ist|title=Tactical Urbanists Are Improving Cities, One Rogue Fix at a Time|work=Smithsonian}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tactical urbanist movement takes inspiration from urban experiments including [[Ciclovía]], [[Paris-Plages]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bossart|first1=Diane|title=The rise of tactical urbanism|url=http://www.nextpittsburgh.com/features/rise-tactical-urbanism/|website=Next Pittsburg|publisher=Next Pittsburg|accessdate=23 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the introduction of plazas and pedestrian malls in New York city during the tenure of [[Janette Sadik-Khan]] as Commissioner of the [[New York City Department of Transportation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Davis|first1=Brian|title=On Broadway, Tactical Urbanism|url=http://faslanyc.blogspot.ca/2010/06/on-broadway-tactical-urbanism.html|website=faslanyc|accessdate=23 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tactical urbanism formally emerged as a movement following a meeting of the Next Generation of [[New Urbanist]] ([http://cnunextgen.wordpress.com/ CNU NextGen]) group in November 2010 in [[New Orleans]]. A driving force of the movement is to put the onus back on individuals to take personal responsibility in creating sustainable buildings, streets, neighborhoods, and cities. Following the meeting, an open source project called [http://issuu.com/streetplanscollaborative/docs/tactical_urbanism_vol.1 Tactical Urbanism: Short TermAction | Long Term Change] was developed by a group from NextGen to define Tactical Urbanism and to promote various interventions to improve urban design and promote positive change in neighbourhoods and communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lydon|first1=Mike|title=The Next Urbanism: A Movement Evolves|url=http://www.planetizen.com/node/48680|website=Planetizen|publisher=Planetizen|accessdate=23 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1984, the English translation of [[The Practice of Everyday Life]] by Frenchman [[Michel de Certeau]] did not use the term "tactical urbanism" to describe events that occurred in 1968 in Paris.&lt;ref&gt;Certeau, Michel de. The Practice of Everyday Life. University of California Press. Reprint edition (December 1, 2011).&lt;/ref&gt; Certeau described tactical urbanism in opposition to "strategic urbanism", although the modern usage tends not to make this distinction.

The [[Project for Public Spaces]] uses the phrase "Lighter, Quicker, Cheaper," coined by urban designer Eric Reynolds, to describe the same basic approach expressed by tactical urbanism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pps.org/reference/lighter-quicker-cheaper-a-low-cost-high-impact-approach/|title=Lighter, Quicker, Cheaper: A Low-Cost, High-Impact Approach|work=pps.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Types of interventions ==
Tactical urbanism projects vary significantly in scope, size, budget, and support. Projects often begin as grassroots interventions and spread to other cities and are in some cases adopted by municipal governments as best practices. A list of common interventions are listed below.

=== Better block initiatives  ===
Temporarily transforming retail streets using cheap or donated materials and volunteers. Spaces are transformed by introducing food carts,  sidewalk tables, temporary bike lanes and narrowing of streets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Better Block|url=http://betterblock.org/|website=The Better Block|accessdate=23 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Chair bombing  ===
The act of removing salvageable materials and using it to build public seating. The chairs are placed in areas that either are quiet or lack comfortable places to sit.

=== De-fencing ===
The act of removing unnecessary fences to break down barriers between neighbours, beautify communities, and encourage community building.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Downtown De-Fence Project|url=http://www.publicspace.ca/defence.htm|website=Downtown De-Fence Project|publisher=Toronto Building Space Committee|accessdate=23 October 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160123071625/http://publicspace.ca/defence.htm|archivedate=23 January 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Depaving ===
The act of removing unnecessary pavement to transform driveways and parking into green space so that rainwater can be absorbed and neighbourhoods beautified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Why Depave|url=http://depave.org/learn/why-depave/|website=Depave|accessdate=11 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Food carts/trucks ===
[[Food carts]] and [[food trucks|trucks]] are used to attract people to underused public spaces and offer small business opportunities for entrepreneurs.

=== Guerilla gardening  ===
[[Guerrilla gardening]] is the act of gardening on land that the gardeners do not have the legal rights to utilize, such as abandoned sites, areas not being cared for, or private property.

=== Open Streets  ===
To temporarily provide safe spaces for walking, bicycling, skating, and social activities; promote local economic development; and raise awareness about the impact of cars in urban spaces. 'Open Streets' is an anglicized term for the South American '[[Ciclovia]]', which originated in [[Bogota]].

=== PARK(ing) Day ===
{{see also|Parking Day}}
An annual event where on street parking is converted into park-like spaces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Best|first1=Hilary|title=Park(ing) Day!|url=http://spacing.ca/toronto/2011/09/16/parking-day/|website=Spacing Toronto|publisher=Spacing Toronto|accessdate=23 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://streetswiki.wikispaces.com/Park(ing)+Day&lt;/ref&gt; Park(ing) Day was launched in 2005 by [[Rebar art and design studio]].

=== Pavement to Plazas===
Popularized in New York City, pavement plazas involve converting space on streets to usable public space. The closure of [[Times Square]] to vehicular traffic and its low-cost conversion to a pedestrian plaza is a primary example of a pavement plaza.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nyc.gov/html/dot/html/pedestrians/publicplaza-sites.shtml|title=NYC DOT - NYC Plaza Program Sites|work=nyc.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/bloomberg-crows-times-square-pedestrian-plaza-article-1.1557047&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pop-up cafes ===
Pop-up cafes are temporary patios or terraces built in parking spots to provide overflow seating for a nearby cafe or for passersby. Most common in cities where sidewalks are narrow and where there otherwise is not room for outdoor sitting or eating areas.

=== Pop-up parks  ===
Pop Up Parks temporarily or permanently transform underused spaces into community gathering areas through beautification.

=== Pop-up retail ===
[[Pop-up retail|Pop-up shops]] are temporary retail stores that are set up in vacant stores or property.

'''Yogbir Singh Kansakar''' ([[Devanagari]]: योगवीरसिं कंसकार) (alternative name: '''Jogbir Singh Kansakar''') (16 April 1885 - 29 March 1942) was a Nepalese poet, social reformer and one of the [[Four Pillars of Nepal Bhasa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last =| first =| authorlink = | coauthors = | url = | title =Contributions to Nepalese Studies, Volume 22| work = | publisher =Institute of Nepal and Asian Studies, Tribhuvan University| year=1995| accessdate =}} Page 74.&lt;/ref&gt; He worked to develop his mother tongue and promote Buddhism in the face of repression by the [[Rana dynasty|Rana]] rulers.&lt;ref&gt;Lienhard, Siegfried (1992).

Kansakar was the guru and inspiration of [[Chittadhar Hridaya]], one of the greatest literary figures of 20th-century Nepal.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, Todd T. and Tuladhar, Subarna Man (2009). ''Sugata Saurabha - An Epic Poem from Nepal on the Life of the Buddha by Chittadhar Hridaya.'' New York: Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|978-0-19-534182-9}}. Page 350.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==

[[Kansakar]] was born at Kel Tol, Kwachhen Nani, [[Kathmandu]]. His father was Chaityabir Singh and his mother was Laxmi Nani. The family owned a cloth shop. As a young man in 1905, Kansakar got involved in the social reformist activities of an organization known as [[Arya Samaj]]. He was fined and jailed by the Ranas for promoting an unorthodox religion.&lt;ref&gt;LeVine, Sarah and Gellner, David N. (2005) ''Rebuilding Buddhism: The Theravada Movement in Twentieth-Century Nepal.'' Harvard University Press. {{ISBN|978-0-674-01908-9}}. Page 41. Retrieved 6 January 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Out of prison, a dejected Kansakar went to [[Kolkata]], India where he was inspired by the activity in [[Bengali language]] publication and love of literature among Bengalis.&lt;ref&gt;Hridaya, Chittadhar (1982, third ed). ''Jheegu Sahitya ("Our Literature").'' Kathmandu: Nepal Bhasa Parisad. Page 93.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sudarshan, Bhikshu (1970). ''Lumanke Bahahpin ("Memorable Figures").'' Kathmandu: Chwasa Pasa. Page 41.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

Returning to Kathmandu, Kansakar took to writing poetry, and his cloth shop was turned into a gathering place for poets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Shrestha|first=Bal Gopal|title=The Newars: The Indigenous Population of the Kathmandu Valley in the Modern State of Nepal)|url=http://www.thlib.org/static/reprints/contributions/CNAS_26_01_04.pdf|accessdate=23 March 2012|newspaper=CNAS Journal|date=January 1999}} Page 88.&lt;/ref&gt; Each week, they would bring a copybook filled with their compositions and discuss each other's works. When the Bada Guruju (chief royal priest) came to know about it, he had all the copybooks confiscated.

Inspired by Tulsi Meher's homespun movement, Kansakar campaigned to popularize homespun and encouraged people to install handlooms in their homes. In 1927, he established a company named Vastrakala Bhavan to produce textiles. Kansakar was an advocate of female education, and he sent his daughter [[Vidyabati Kansakar]] to India among the first batch of students to receive nurse training.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last= Tuladhar|first= Lochan Tara|title= Yogbir Singh Kasaa: A saga of selfless contributions|url= |accessdate=|newspaper=Matina|date=August 2008}} Pages 20-22.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Library incident==

In 1929, Kansakar headed a committee which petitioned the prime minister to be allowed to open a library. Kansakar and the rest of the signers of the appeal were arrested and fined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last =Dali| first =Indira| authorlink = | coauthors = | url = http://dr.ntu.edu.sg/bitstream/handle/10220/2506/AMIC_1991_AUG26-29_09.pdf?sequence=1| title =Libraries and information centres| work = Libraries and information centres in Nepal: CEDA library and documentation branch| publisher =Singapore: Asian Mass Communication Research &amp; Information Centre| year=1991| accessdate =6 March 2012}} Page 17.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Tumbahang|first=Govinda Bahadur|title=Marginalization of Indigenous Languages of Nepal|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-260060566.html|accessdate=3 January 2012|newspaper=Contributions to Nepalese Studies|date=January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1934, all the [[Newar]] authors were summoned before the prime minister and warned to stop writing in Nepal Bhasa.&lt;ref&gt;Hridaya, Chittadhar (1982, third ed). ''Jheegu Sahitya ("Our Literature").'' Kathmandu: Nepal Bhasa Parishad. Page 101.&lt;/ref&gt;

Kansakar also worked to promote [[Theravada Buddhism]] which aroused the anger of the government. In 1931, he was fined and jailed with 11 other people including Buddhist teacher [[Dhammalok Mahasthavir]], poet Chittadhar Hridaya and trader [[Dharma Man Tuladhar]] for trying to spread an "unorthodox religion".&lt;ref&gt;LeVine, Sarah and Gellner, David N. (2005). ''Rebuilding Buddhism: The Theravada Movement in Twentieth-Century Nepal.'' Harvard University Press. {{ISBN|0-674-01908-3}}, {{ISBN|978-0-674-01908-9}}. Page 41.&lt;/ref&gt; He was also harassed and flogged for his activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last =Sthavir| first =Dharmalok| authorlink = | coauthors = | url = http://himalaya.socanth.cam.ac.uk/collections/journals/regmi/pdf/regmi_09.doc| title =A Journey to Great China| work = Regmi Research Series| publisher = Regmi Research| date=1 December 1977| accessdate = 11 October 2012}} Pages 35-36.&lt;/ref&gt;

His wife Shobha Laxmi died in 1937, and he married Buddha Maya. In 1940, the government mounted a clampdown against political workers, writers and anybody it saw as a threat to the state. Kansakar was arrested and held for 85 days.&lt;ref&gt;Sudarshan, Bhikshu (1970). ''Lumanke Bahahpin ("Memorable Figures").'' Kathmandu: Chwasa Pasa. Page 56.&lt;/ref&gt;

An anthology of Kansakar's poems entitled ''Yog-Sudha'' was published by Nepal Bhasa Parisad in 1951.&lt;ref&gt;Hridaya, Chittadhar (ed.) (1951) ''Yog-Sudha.'' Kathmandu: Nepal Bhasa Parisad. https://books.google.com.np/books/about/Yog_Sudha.html?id=i3DfcQAACAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
A street in central Kathmandu was named Yogbir Singh Marg in his honor by [[Kathmandu Metropolitan City]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last= |first= |authorlink= |coauthors= |url=http://www.kathmandu.gov.np/UserFiles/Image/kmc_street_map01.jpg |title=Addressed Road Network Map |work= |publisher=Kathmandu Metropolitan City |date= |accessdate=3 January 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120306153444/http://www.kathmandu.gov.np/UserFiles/Image/kmc_street_map01.jpg |archivedate=March 6, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
