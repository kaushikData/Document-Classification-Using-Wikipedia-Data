The Prize is administered at the [[Peter A. Allard School of Law]] at the [[University of British Columbia]], [[Vancouver]], [[Canada]].

Some Allard Prize nominees and winners have previously been subjected to threats, violence, torture, imprisonment and other attacks associated with their anti-corruption and human rights activities.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; One honourable mention recipient, Russian lawyer [[Sergei Magnitsky]], was nominated posthumously after being tortured to death in prison.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/the-trump-administration-sends-a-commendable-signal-to-despots-everywhere/2017/12/25/dc799340-e746-11e7-a65d-1ac0fd7f097e_story.html|title=The Trump administration sends a commendable signal to despots everywhere|last=|first=|date=25 December 2017|work=The Washington Post|access-date=21 January 2018|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.allardprize.org/recipient-and-honourable-mentions/sergei-magnitsky|title=Sergei Magnitsky|last=|first=|date=2015|website=Allard Prize for International Integrity|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=21 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Allard Prize winner and any honourable mention recipients are chosen through a comprehensive nomination and selection process involving the Allard Prize Committee, sub-committees and an Advisory Board.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.allardprize.org/process-nomination-and-selection|title=Process of Nomination and Selection|last=|first=|date=|website=Allard Prize for International Integrity|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=21 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the 2015 Allard Prize, over 140 people were nominated from 50 countries. In 2017, the number of nominations grew to 244 from 70 countries, with 42 nominations (17 percent) from North America.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

===Nomination===
There are no restrictions as to who may submit a nominee for consideration. Nominations may come from anywhere including from members of the Allard Prize Committee. Self-nominations are allowed for both individuals and organizations.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.allardprize.org/frequently-asked-questions|title=Frequently Asked Questions|last=|first=|date=|website=Allard Prize for International Integrity|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=7 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nominees range from neighbourhood activists to prominent world leaders, academics, social movements, political organizations and charitable groups.

Nominations are accepted on a rolling basis, with a new nomination cycle beginning with the announcement of finalists in the Prize year. Previously nominated candidates can be re-nominated, but new nomination forms must be submitted. There are no minimum or maximum age limits or any other limiting characteristics as to eligibility, with the exception that members of the Allard Prize Committee, Advisory Board and members of their immediate families may not be awarded the Allard Prize during their respective terms and for one year following the end of their terms.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

===Selection===
The Allard Prize Committee reviews all nominations and is responsible for selecting the Prize winner and any honourable mention recipients. The selection process involves research, subcommittees and due diligence, two levels of short-listing, and a requirement to submit short-listed of nominees to the Allard Prize Advisory Board for review and comment prior to the selection of the winner and honourable mention recipients.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

==Awarding the Prize==

== Controversies ==

=== Protest against selection of finalist Operação Lava Jato (Brazil - Car Wash Task Force) - 2017 ===
The selection of Brazil's Car Wash Task Force (Operação Lava Jato) as a 2017 Allard Prize finalist triggered objections in Brazil and Canada. A group of Brazilian lawyers wrote to the Allard Prize Committee demanding the Committee rescind their finalist status and alleging "numerous abuses, arbitrariness and legal violations" by the Task Force.

=== Allegation of Third World Bias ===
Shortly after the 2017 Allard Prize finalists were announced, journalist Russell Mokhiber noted in an article published in Corporate Crime Reporter that the Allard Prize has "a bias in favour of anti-corruption fighters in the Third World" rather than selecting nominees from Western developed countries. Mokhiber speculated that the bias might be due to a heavy representation of corporate lawyers, World Bank and Asian Development Bank personnel on the selection and advisory committees. In an interview with Mokhiber, Allard Prize Executive Director Nicole Barrett acknowledged that none of the previous finalists have been from North America. Noting that the majority of nominees are from the developing world, she said that the Allard Prize may consider developing a formal requirement of geographical balance to address this concern.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

'''Aparoksha'''  ([[Sanskrit]]: अपरोक्ष), a Sanskrit adjective meaning not invisible or perceptible,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sanskrit Dictionary|publisher=Spokensanskrit de.|url=http://spokensanskrit.de/index.php?script=HK&amp;beginning=0+&amp;tinput=+%E0%A4%85%E0%A4%AA%E0%A4%B0%E0%A5%8B%E0%A4%95%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%B7&amp;trans=Translate&amp;direction=AU }}&lt;/ref&gt; refers to direct intuitive [[Vidya (Knowledge)|knowledge]] which is one of the seven stages of knowledge or conditions of [[Chidabhasa]], the first three being the sources of bondage and the rest four being the processes of liberation; and to the continuation of the deepening of conventional knowledge. It removes sorrows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Philosophy of the Panchdasi|author=Swami Krishnanda|publisher=The Divine Life Society|url= http://www.swami-krishnananda.org/panch/panch_07.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Indian Philosophy]], the three traditional kinds of knowledge are – ''[[pratyaksha]]'' (empirical), ''[[paroksha]]'' (conventional, universal) and ''aparoksha'' (transcendental).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title= The Eastern Anthropologist, Vol.49| publisher= Ethnographic and Folk Culture Society|page=103|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=H5oiAQAAMAAJ&amp;q=aproksha&amp;dq=aproksha&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=RwW-U7yeHY25uATW4YH4AQ&amp;ved=0CEUQ6AEwCQ}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Aparoksha'' is the highest kind of knowledge which cannot be gained without the practice of morality that converts ''paroksha'' knowledge from which unity of existence is derived. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title= Five years of Theosophy| publisher= Theosophical Pub. Society|page=138| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tPNNAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=aproksha&amp;dq=aproksha&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=RwW-U7yeHY25uATW4YH4AQ&amp;ved=0CDQQ6AEwBQ }}&lt;/ref&gt; This knowledge is gained by establishing a ''guru-shishya sambandha'' ([[Guru-shishya tradition]]) with a teacher who has already experienced that kind of knowledge ([[Aparoksanubhuti]]); the [[karma]] or acts required to be done, after gain of ''Aparoksha jnana'' is ''Vidya-karma'' which consists in ''sravana'' (hearing of srutis), ''[[Manana (reflection)|manana]]'' (reflection) and ''[[nididhyasana]]'' (meditation on Brahman). &lt;ref&gt; {{cite book|title=Research Journals of Philosophy and Sciences  Vol.3| author= Kedar Nath Ram Nath| publisher= University of Michigan|pages= 57,71| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ixfkAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=aproksha&amp;dq=aproksha&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Cge-U8WtIISOuATMhYCADw&amp;ved=0CBkQ6AEwADgK }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aparoksha is ''[[savikalpa]] jnana'' (knowledge) when one re-recognizes the non-dual nature of the ever-realized Self ([[Tat Tvam Asi]]), it is the immediate knowledge gained through the ''[[pramana]]s''; practice of ''[[Dhyana in Hinduism|Dhyana]]'' (meditation) removes all ''vikalpas'' (varied thoughts) and leads to ''[[nirvikalpa]]'' or the thoughtless state, which is the highest experience, the immediate realization of Truth. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title= The Wisdom of Sri Dattatreya|author =K.N.Subramanian| publisher= Sura Books| pages= 80,81| url =https://books.google.com/books?id=wbeg45SMdagC&amp;pg=PA80&amp;dq=aproksha&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=RwW-U7yeHY25uATW4YH4AQ&amp;ved=0CBwQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=aproksha&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the method of cessation from individual and collective perception leading to the position of neutrality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cyber temple of the Beautiful Lord – The Bhagavata|url= http://www.mahaprabhu.net/bhag2.html  }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Sarvam khalvidam Brahman'' (all this is Brahman) is ''paroksha'' knowledge, but the understanding  that ''[[Aham Brahman Asmi]]'' (I am Brahman) is ''aparoksha'' knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Self Knowledge|url= http://www.vijnana.org/2009/04/shravanammananamnidhidhyasanam.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The name "applied behavior analysis" has replaced [[behavior modification]] because the latter approach suggested attempting to change behavior without clarifying the relevant behavior-environment interactions. In contrast, ABA tries to change behavior by first [[Functional analysis (psychology)|assessing the functional relationship between a targeted behavior and the environment]].&lt;ref name=JABA/&gt; Further, the approach often seeks to develop socially acceptable alternatives for aberrant behaviors.&lt;ref name=JABA&gt;{{cite journal|author=Mace, F.C.|title=The significance and future of functional analysis methodologies|journal=Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis|date=1994|volume=27|pages=385–392|doi=10.1901/jaba.1994.27-385|pmc=1297814|issue=2|pmid=16795830}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=JABA2&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Baer, D.M.|author2= Wolf, M.M.|author3= Risley, T.R.|lastauthoramp=y|title=Some still-current dimensions of applied behavior analysis|journal=Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis|date=1987|volume=20|issue=4|pages=313–327|doi=10.1901/jaba.1987.20-313|pmc=1286071|pmid=16795703}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=JEAB&gt;{{cite journal|author1=F.C.

==Definition==
ABA is an applied science devoted to developing procedures which will produce observable changes in behavior.&lt;ref name=JABA3/&gt; It is to be distinguished from the [[experimental analysis of behavior]], which focuses on basic experimental research,&lt;ref name=As-in-ABA&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Dillenburger, K. |author2=Keenan, M. |title=None of the As in ABA stand for autism: dispelling the myths |journal=J Intellect Dev Disabil |volume=34 |issue=2 |pages=193–95 |year=2009 |pmid=19404840 |doi=10.1080/13668250902845244}}&lt;/ref&gt; but it uses principles developed by such research, in particular [[operant conditioning]] and [[classical conditioning]]. Behavior analysis adopts the viewpoint of [[radical behaviorism]], treating thoughts, emotions, and other covert activity as behavior that is subject to the same rules as overt responses. This represents a shift away from methodological behaviorism, which restricts behavior-change procedures to behaviors that are overt, and was the conceptual underpinning of [[behavior modification]].

Behavior analysts also emphasize that the science of behavior must be a ''natural'' science as opposed to a ''social'' science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Marr |first1=M |title=The natural selection: behavior analysis as a natural science |journal=European Journal of Behavior Analysis |date=2009 |volume=10 |issue=2 |pages=103–118 |url=http://www.ejoba.org/PDF/2009_2/Marr_2009.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129034739/http://www.ejoba.org/PDF/2009_2/Marr_2009.pdf |archivedate=29 November 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; As such, behavior analysts focus on the observable relationship of behavior with the environment, including [[antecedent (behavioral psychology)|antecedents]] and consequences, without resort to [[Subfields of psychology|"hypothetical constructs"]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Thompson, T. |doi=10.1901/jeab.1984.41-211 |pmc=1348034 |year=1984 |title=The examining magistrate for nature: a retrospective review of Claude Bernard's An Introduction to the Study of Experimental Medicine |journal=Journal of the Experimental Analysis of Behavior |volume=2 |issue=41 |pages=212–13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The beginnings of ABA can be traced back to the research of Teodoro Ayllon and [[Jack Michael]] with their study "The psychiatric nurse as a behavioral engineer" (1959) that they submitted to the ''[[Journal of the Experimental Analysis of Behavior]]'' (JEAB) as part of their doctoral dissertation at the [[University of Houston]]. The researchers were training the staff and nurses at a [[psychiatric hospital]] how to use a [[token economy]] based on the principles of [[operant conditioning]] and [[behavioral engineering]]&amp;mdash;a synonym for ABA,&lt;ref name=behavioranalysislearning&gt;

In 1968, Baer, Bijou, Risley, Birnbrauer, Wolf, and James Sherman joined the Department of Human Development and Family Life at the [[University of Kansas]], where they founded the ''Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis''.&lt;ref name=HistoryofJABAResearchFaculty&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Baer|first1=Donald M.|journal=Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis|date=1993|volume=26|issue=4|pages=569–570|doi=10.1901/jaba.1993.26-569|pmid=16795815|pmc=1297894|title=A brief, selective history of the Department of Human Development and Family Life at the University of Kansas: The early years}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Notable graduate students from the University of Washington include Robert Wahler, James Sherman, and [[Ivar Lovaas]].&lt;ref name=lovaas/&gt;&lt;ref name=HistoryofJABAResearchFaculty/&gt; Lovaas established the UCLA Young Autism Project while teaching at the [[University of California, Los Angeles]], and devoted nearly half a century to groundbreaking research and practice aimed at improving the lives of children with autism and their families. In 1965, Lovaas published a series of articles that outlined his system for coding observed behaviors, described a pioneering investigation of the antecedents and consequences that maintained a problem behavior,&lt;ref name="Lovaas"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Smith|first=T|author2=Eikseth|title=S|journal=Journal of Autism &amp; Developmental Disorders|date=14 December 2010|volume=41|issue=3|pages=375–378|doi=10.1007/s10803-010-1162-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; and relied upon the methods of [[errorless learning]] that was initially devised by [[Charles Ferster]] to teach nonverbal children to speak. Lovaas also described how to use social (secondary) reinforcers, teach children to imitate, and what interventions (including electric shocks) may be used to reduce aggression and life-threatening self-injury.&lt;ref name="Lovaas"/&gt; 

In 1987, Lovaas published the landmark study, "Behavioral Treatment and Normal Educational and Intellectual Functioning in Young Autistic Children".&lt;ref name=lovaas/&gt; The experimental group in this study received up to 40-hours per week in a 1:1 teaching setting using errorless [[discrete trial training]] (DTT). The treatment is done at home with parents involved in every aspect of treatment, and the curriculum is highly individualized with a heavy emphasis on teaching eye contact and language. ABA principles are used to motivate learning and reduce non-desired behaviors. The outcome of this study indicated 47% of the experimental group (9/19) went on to lose their autism diagnosis and were described as indistinguishable from their typical adolescent peers. This included passing regular education without assistance, making and maintaining friends, and becoming self-sufficient as adults. These gains were maintained as reported in the 1993 study, "Long-Term Outcome for Children With Autism Who Received Early Intensive Behavioral Treatment". Lovaas’ work went on to be recognized by the US Surgeon General in 1999, and his research outcomes were replicated in university and private settings. The "Lovaas Method" went on to become known as early intensive behavioral intervention (EIBI), or DTT for 30 to 40 hours per week. 

In addition to being a major contributor of ABA, Lovaas taught now prominent behaviorists, such as [[Robert Koegel]], Laura Schreibman, Tristram Smith, John McEachin, Ron Leaf, [[Doreen Granpeesheh]], Jacquie Wynn, and over 20,000 UCLA students who took his "Behavior Modification" course during his 50 years of teaching. He even cofounded what is today the [[Autism Society of America]] (ASA), published hundreds of research articles and books, received state and national awards, and forced school districts to adopt evidenced based teaching programs. His work influenced how autism was treated, and improved the lives of parents and children stricken with the autism diagnosis worldwide.

Over the years, "behavior analysis" gradually superseded "behavior modification";  that is, from simply trying to alter problematic behavior, behavior analysts sought to understand the function of that behavior, what antecedents promote and maintain it, and how it can be replaced by successful behavior.&lt;ref name=JEAB/&gt; This analysis is based on careful initial assessment of a behavior's function and a testing of methods that produce changes in behavior.

While ABA seems to be intrinsically linked to autism intervention, it is also used for [[applied animal behavior]] and [[clinical behavior analysis]], in [[behavioral medicine]], [[behavioral neuroscience]], and [[criminology]], to [[Organizational behavior management|increase job safety and performance]], [[Systematic desensitization|counteract phobias]], and [[Positive behavior support|improve classroom management]].&lt;ref name=PBSExpansion&gt;{{cite journal|title=Positive behavior support: Expanding the application of applied behavior analysis.|last1=Anderson|first1=CM|last2=Freeman|first2=KA|journal=The Behavior Analyst|volume=23|issue=1|pages=85–94|pmc=2731369|date=Spring 2000|pmid=22478340}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=abapbsschoolviolence&gt;{{cite journal|title=Applying behavior analysis to school violence and discipline problems|last1=Anderson|first1=CM|last2=Kincald|first2=D|journal=The Behavior Analyst|volume=28|issue=1|pages=49–63|pmc=2755344|year=2005|pmid=22478439}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=SWPBIS&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=schoolwide+positive+behavioral+interventions+%26+supports|title=The impact of schoolwide positive behavioral interventions and supports on bullying and peer rejection: a randomized controlled effectiveness trial|last1=Waasdorp|first1=TE|last2=Bradshaw|first2=CP|last3=Leaf|first3=PJ|journal=Archives of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine|volume=166|issue=2|pages=149–56|date=Winter 2012|doi=10.1001/archpediatrics.2011.755|pmid=22312173}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics==

Baer, Wolf, and Risley's 1968 article&lt;ref name=BWR/&gt; is still used as the standard description of ABA.&lt;ref name=CooperHeron2007&gt;{{cite book |ref = harvnb |author1=Cooper, J.O. |author2=Heron, T.E. |author3=Heward, W.L. |title=Applied Behavior Analysis |url =http://wps.prenhall.com/chet_cooper_appliedbeh_2 |edition=2nd |year=2007 |publisher=Prentice Hall |isbn=0-13-142113-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cooper|Heron|Heward|1987|p=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; It lists the following the seven characteristics of ABA.
* '''Applied''':  ABA focuses on the social significance of the behavior studied. For example, a non-applied researcher may study eating behavior because this research helps to clarify metabolic processes, whereas the applied researcher may study eating behavior in individuals who eat too little or too much, trying to change such behavior so that it is more acceptable to the persons involved.
* '''Behavioral''':  ABA is pragmatic; it asks how it is possible to get an individual to do something effectively. To answer this question, the behavior itself must be objectively measured. Verbal descriptions are treated as behavior in themselves, and not as substitutes for the behavior described.
* '''Analytic''':  Behavior analysis is successful when the analyst understands and can manipulate the events that control a target behavior. This may be relatively easy to do in the lab, where a researcher is able to arrange the relevant events, but it is not always easy, or ethical, in an applied situation.&lt;ref name=BWR&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Baer, D.M. |author2=Wolf, M.M. |author3=Risley, T.R. |year=1968 |title=Some current dimensions of applied behavior analysis |journal=J Appl Behav Anal |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages= 91–97 |doi=10.1901/jaba.1968.1-91 |pmc=1310980 |pmid=16795165}}&lt;/ref&gt; Baer et al. outline two methods that may be used in applied settings to demonstrate control while maintaining ethical standards. These are the reversal design and the multiple baseline design. In the reversal design, the experimenter first measures the behavior of choice, introduces an intervention, and then measures the behavior again. Then, the intervention is removed, or reduced, and the behavior is measured yet again. The intervention is effective to the extent that the behavior changes and then changes back in response to these manipulations.  The multiple baseline method may be used for behaviors that seem irreversible. Here, several behaviors are measured and then the intervention is applied to each in turn. The effectiveness of the intervention is revealed by changes in just the behavior to which the intervention is being applied. 
* '''Technological''':  The description of analytic research must be clear and detailed, so that any competent researcher can repeat it accurately.&lt;ref name=BWR/&gt;  Cooper et al. describe a good way to check this: Have a person trained in applied behavior analysis read the description and then act out the procedure in detail. If the person makes any mistakes or has to ask any questions then the description needs improvement.&lt;ref name=CooperHeron2007/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cooper|Heron|Heward|1987|p=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Conceptually Systematic''':  Behavior analysis should not simply produce a list of effective interventions.  Rather, to the extent possible, these methods should be grounded in behavioral principles. This is aided by the use of theoretically meaningful terms, such as "secondary reinforcement" or "errorless discrimination" where appropriate.
* '''Effective''':  Though analytic methods should be theoretically grounded, they must be effective. If an intervention does not produce a large enough effect for practical use, then the analysis has failed
* '''General''':  Behavior analysts should aim for interventions that are generally applicable; the methods should work in different environments, apply to more than one specific behavior, and have long-lasting effects.

===Other proposed characteristics===

In 2005, Heward et al. suggested that the following five characteristics should be added:&lt;ref name=Heward&gt;{{cite book |editor=Heward, W.L. |year=2005 |title=Focus on behavior analysis in education: Achievements, challenges, and opportunities |location=Upper Saddle River, NJ |publisher=Prentice Hall/Merrill |isbn=0-13-111339-9|display-editors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Accountable''': To be accountable means that ABA must be able to demonstrate that its methods are effective. This requires the repeatedly measuring the success of interventions, and, if necessary, making changes that improve their effectiveness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Stokes, Trevor |author2=Budd, Karen S. |title=A small matter of proof: the legacy of Donald M. Baer |publisher=Context Press |location=Reno, NV |year=2003 |isbn=1-878978-43-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Public''': The methods, results, and theoretical analyses of ABA must be published and open to scrutiny. There are no hidden treatments or mystical, metaphysical explanations.
* '''Doable''': To be generally useful, interventions should be available to a variety of individuals, who might be teachers, parents, therapists, or even those who wish to modify their own behavior. With proper planning and training, many interventions can be applied by almost anyone willing to invest the effort.&lt;ref name=Heward1&gt;Heward, 205 p. 322&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Empowering''': ABA provides tools that give the practitioner feedback on the results of interventions. These allow clinicians to assess their skill level and build confidence in their effectiveness.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cooper|Heron|Heward|1987|p=19}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Optimistic''': According to several leading authors, behavior analysts have cause to be optimistic that their efforts are socially worthwhile, for the following reasons:
** The behaviors impacted by behavior analysis are largely determined by learning and controlled by manipulable aspects of the environment.
** Practitioners can improve performance by direct and continuous measurements.
** As a practitioner uses behavioral techniques with positive outcomes, they become more confident of future success.
** The literature provides many examples of success in teaching individuals considered previously unteachable.

==Concepts==

===Behavior===
{{Main article|Behavior}}

Behavior refers to the movement of some part of an organism that changes some aspect of the environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Johnston |first=James M. |lastauthoramp=y |last2=Pennypacker |first2=H.S. |year=1993a |title=Strategies and tactics of behavioral research |location=Hillsdale, NJ |publisher=Erlbaum Associates |page=23 |isbn=0-8058-0905-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Often, the term behavior refers to a class of responses that share physical dimensions or functions, and in that case a ''response'' is a single instance of that behavior.&lt;ref name=CooperHeron2007/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cooper|Heron|Heward|1987|p=26}}&lt;/ref&gt; If a group of responses have the same function, this group may be called a response class. "Repertoire" refers to the various responses available to an individual; the term may refer to responses that are relevant to a particular situation, or it may refer to everything a person can do.

====Operant conditioning====
{{Main article|Operant conditioning}}

Operant behavior is the so-called "voluntary" behavior that is sensitive to, or controlled by its consequences. Specifically, operant conditioning refers to the [[three-term contingency]] that uses [[stimulus control]], in particular an antecedent contingency called the discriminative stimulus (SD) that influences the strengthening or weakening of behavior through such consequences as [[reinforcement]] or [[punishment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cooper|Heron|Heward|1987|p=33}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term is used quite generally, from reaching for a candy bar, to turning up the heat to escape an aversive chill, to studying for an exam to get good grades.

====Respondent (classical) conditioning====
{{Main article|Classical conditioning}}

Respondent (classical) conditioning is based on innate stimulus-response relationships called reflexes. In his famous experiments with dogs, Pavlov usually used the salivary reflex, namely salivation (unconditioned response) following the taste of food (unconditioned stimulus). Pairing a neutral stimulus, for example a bell (conditioned stimulus) with food caused the bell to elicit salivation (conditioned response). Thus, in classical conditioning, the conditioned stimulus becomes a signal for a biologically significant consequence. Note that in respondent conditioning, unlike operant conditioning, the response does not ''produce'' a reinforcer or punisher (e.g. the dog does not get food ''because'' it salivates).

===Environment===

The environment is the entire constellation of stimuli in which an organism exists.&lt;ref name="Michael, J. 2004"&gt;Michael, J. (2004). ''Concepts and principles of behavior analysis'' (rev. ed.) Kalamazoo, MI: Society for the Advancement of Behavior Analysis.&lt;/ref&gt; This includes events both inside and outside of an organism, but only real physical events are included.  A stimulus is an "energy change that affects an organism through its receptor cells".&lt;ref name="Michael, J. 2004"/&gt;

'''A stimulus can be described''':
* '''Topographically''' by its physical features.
* '''Temporally''' by when it occurs.
* '''Functionally''' by its effect on behavior.

===Reinforcement===
{{Main article|Reinforcement}}

Reinforcement is the key element in operant conditioning&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Flora, S.R. |title=The power of reinforcement |publisher=State University of New York Press |location=Albany |year=2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and in most behavior change programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1901/jaba.1993.26-527 |author1=Northup, J. |author2=Vollmer, T.R. |author3=Serret, K. |year=1993 |title=Publication trends in 25 years of the Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis |journal= Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis |volume=26 |issue=4 |pages=527–37 |pmid=16795803 |pmc=1297882}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the process by which behavior is strengthened. If a behavior is followed closely in time by a stimulus and this results in an increase in the future frequency of that behavior, then the stimulus is a positive reinforcer. If the removal of an event serves as a reinforcer, this is termed negative reinforcement.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cooper|Heron|Heward|1987|p=27}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are multiple [[schedules of reinforcement]] that affect the future probability of behavior.

===Punishment===
{{Main article|Punishment (psychology)}}

Punishment is a process by which a consequence immediately follows a behavior which decreases the future frequency of that behavior. As with reinforcement, a stimulus can be added ([[positive punishment]]) or removed ([[negative punishment]]). Broadly, there are three types of punishment: presentation of aversive stimuli (e.g., pain), response cost (removal of desirable stimuli as in monetary fines), and restriction of freedom (as in a 'time out').&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cooper|Heron|Heward|1987|p=355}}&lt;/ref&gt; Punishment in practice can often result in unwanted side effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Reese E.P. |title=The analysis of human operant behavior |publisher=Brown |location=Dubuque IA |year=1966 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some other potential unwanted effects include resentment over being punished, attempts to escape the punishment, expression of pain and negative emotions associated with it, and recognition by the punished individual between the punishment and the person delivering it.

===Extinction===
{{Main article|Extinction (psychology)}}

Extinction is the technical term to describe the procedure of withholding/discontinuing reinforcement of a previously reinforced behavior, resulting in the decrease of that behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Miltenberger, R. G. "Behavioral Modification: Principles and Procedures". [[Thomson/Wadsworth]], 2008. p. 102.&lt;/ref&gt; The behavior is then set to be extinguished (Cooper et al.). Extinction procedures are often preferred over punishment procedures, as many punishment procedures are deemed unethical and in many states prohibited. Nonetheless, extinction procedures must be implemented with utmost care by professionals, as they are generally associated with extinction bursts. An extinction burst is the temporary increase in the frequency, intensity, and/or duration of the behavior targeted for extinction.&lt;ref&gt;Miltenberger, R. G. "Behavioral Modification: Principles and Procedures". [[Thomson/Wadsworth]], 2008. p. 104.&lt;/ref&gt; Other characteristics of an extinction burst include an extinction-produced aggression—the occurrence of an emotional response to an extinction procedure often manifested as aggression; and b) extinction-induced response variability—the occurrence of novel behaviors that did not typically occur prior to the extinction procedure. These novel behaviors are a core component of [[shaping (psychology)|shaping]] procedures.

===Discriminated operant and three-term contingency===

In addition to a relation being made between behavior and its consequences, operant conditioning also establishes relations between antecedent conditions and behaviors. This differs from the S–R formulations (If-A-then-B), and replaces it with an AB-because-of-C formulation. In other words, the relation between a behavior (B) and its context (A) is because of consequences (C), more specifically, this relationship between AB because of C indicates that the relationship is established by prior consequences that have occurred in similar contexts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Moxley, R.A. |year=2004 |title=Pragmatic selectionism. The philosophy of behavior analysis |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_6884/is_1_5/ai_n28246897/ |journal=The Behavior Analyst Today |volume=5 |pages=108–25 |doi=10.1037/h0100137}}&lt;/ref&gt; This antecedent–behavior–consequence contingency is termed the three-term contingency. A behavior which occurs more frequently in the presence of an antecedent condition than in its absence is called a discriminated operant. The antecedent stimulus is called a discriminative stimulus (S&lt;sup&gt;D&lt;/sup&gt;). The fact that the discriminated operant occurs only in the presence of the discriminative stimulus is an illustration of [[stimulus control]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cooper|Heron|Heward|1987|p=41}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently behavior analysts have been focusing on conditions that occur prior to the circumstances for the current behavior of concern that increased the likelihood of the behavior occurring or not occurring. These conditions have been referred to variously as "Setting Event", "Establishing Operations", and "Motivating Operations" by various researchers in their publications.

===Verbal behavior===
{{Main article|Verbal Behavior}}

[[B.F. Skinner|B.F. Skinner's]] classification system of behavior analysis has been applied to treatment of a host of communication disorders.&lt;ref&gt;Peterson, P. (2007). Promoting generalization and maintenance of skills learned via natural language teaching. ''SPL-ABA'' 1(4)–2(1), 97–138&lt;/ref&gt; Skinner's system includes:
* [[Tact (psychology)]] – a verbal response evoked by a non-verbal antecedent and maintained by generalized conditioned reinforcement.
* [[Mand (psychology)]] – behavior under control of motivating operations maintained by a characteristic reinforcer.
* Intraverbals – verbal behavior for which the relevant antecedent stimulus was other verbal behavior, but which does not share the response topography of that prior verbal stimulus (e.g., responding to another speaker's question).
* [[Autoclitic]] – secondary verbal behavior which alters the effect of primary verbal behavior on the listener. Examples involve quantification, grammar, and qualifying statements (e.g., the differential effects of "I think..." vs. "I know...")

For assessment of verbal behavior from Skinner's system see [[Assessment of Basic Language and Learning Skills]].

==Measuring behavior==

When measuring behavior, there are both dimensions of behavior and quantifiable measures of behavior. In applied behavior analysis, the quantifiable measures are a derivative of the dimensions. These dimensions are repeatability, temporal extent, and temporal locus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Johnston |first=J.M. |lastauthoramp=y |last2=Pennypacker |first2=H.S. |year=1993b |title=Readings for Strategies and tactics of behavioral research |edition=2nd |location=Hillsdale, HF |publisher=Erlbaum |isbn=0-8058-0906-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Repeatability===

Response classes occur repeatedly throughout time—i.e., how many times the behavior occurs.
* '''Count''' is the number of occurrences in behavior.
* '''Rate/frequency''' is the number of instances of behavior per unit of time.
* '''Celeration''' is the measure of how the rate changes over time.

===Temporal extent===

This dimension indicates that each instance of behavior occupies some amount of time—i.e., how long the behavior occurs.
* '''Duration''' is the amount of time in which the behavior occurs.

===Temporal locus===

Each instance of behavior occurs at a specific point in time—i.e., when the behavior occurs.
* '''Response latency''' is the measure of elapsed time between the onset of a stimulus and the initiation of the response.
* '''Interresponse time''' is the amount of time that occurs between two consecutive instances of a response class.

===Derivative measures===

Derivative measures are unrelated to specific dimensions:
* '''Percentage''' is the ratio formed by combining the same dimensional quantities.
* '''Trials-to-criterion''' are the number of response opportunities needed to achieve a predetermined level of performance.

==Analyzing behavior change==

===Experimental control===

In applied behavior analysis, all experiments should include the following:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cooper|Heron|Heward|1987|p=422}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* At least one participant
* At least one behavior (dependent variable)
* At least one setting
* A system for measuring the behavior and ongoing visual analysis of data
* At least one treatment or intervention condition
* Manipulations of the independent variable so that its effects on the dependent variable may be quantitatively or qualitatively analyzed
* An intervention that will benefit the participant in some way&lt;ref&gt;[[Behavioral Cusp]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Functional analysis (psychology)==
{{main article|Functional analysis (psychology)}}

===History of functional analysis===

Prior to the seminal article on functional analytic methodology for aberrant behaviors, behaviorists used the behavioral technology available to them at the time. Instead of treating the function of the disruptive behavior, behavioral psychologists would instead ''pre-assume'' consequences to alter disruptive behaviors. For example, in the past to decrease self-injurious behavior in an individual, behaviorists may have delivered an aversive stimulus contingent on the response, or assume a reinforcer without identifying the reinforcer that would be most motivating to the client (Iwata, 1988). This type of intervention was successful to the individual, but it was not uncommon to see other variations of aberrant behavior begin to appear. When applied behavior analysts let clients choose from a wide array of reinforcers (often determined through data collection and reinforcement assessments) in the mid-1980s, reinforcement was shown to be more effective than punishment contingencies. In general, applied behavior analysis as a field favors reinforcement based interventions over aversive contingencies, but at the time the behavioral technology was not advanced enough and the individuals needing intervention had a right to an effective treatment (Van Houten et al., 1988). Nevertheless, not all behavioral therapies involved the use of aversives prior to the mid-1980s. Some behaviorists (for instance, [[B.F. Skinner]]) always preferred reinforcement and extinction contingencies over punishment even during that time.

In 1977, Edward Carr published a paper on potential hypotheses for the occurrence and maintenance of self-injurious behaviors. This paper laid out the initial groundwork for a functional analysis of aberrant behaviors. In the paper, Carr described five potential causes for self-injurious behaviors that included (1) positive social reinforcement contingent on the response, (2) [[negative reinforcement]] in the form of removal of an aversive stimulus contingent on the response, (3) the response produced stimuli possessed reinforcing qualities (automatic reinforcement), (4) the behavior was a byproduct of an underlying psychological condition, and (5) psychodynamic hypothesis in which the behavior was an attempt to reduce guilt. Throughout the paper, Carr cited recent research to support the first three hypotheses, and disprove the latter two hypotheses, but no formal experiment was conducted to determine the controlling variables of the problem behavior.

In 1982, Iwata and colleagues conducted the first experimental analysis of the maintaining variables for self-injurious behavior. In the paper, the researchers alternated between specific conditions to examine whether or not the behavior occurred under specific environmental conditions. Through direct manipulation of the environment, the researchers could accurately identify the controlling variables of the aberrant behavior, and provide interventions that targeted the functional relationship between the behavior and the environment. Since this seminal article was published, a wide range of research has been published in the area of functional analyses of aberrant behaviors. The methodology has since become the gold standard in assessment and treatment of aberrant behaviors.

===Functional behavior assessment (FBA)===
Functional assessment of behavior provides hypotheses about the relationships between specific environmental events and behaviors. Decades of research have established that both desirable and undesirable behaviors are learned and maintained through interactions with the social and physical environment. Functional behavior assessments are used to identify controlling variables for challenging behaviors as the basis for intervention efforts designed to decrease the occurrence of these behaviors.

===Functions of behavior===

Behavior serves two major functions for an individual: (1) to obtain desired events, or (2) to escape/avoid undesired events. Put another way, individuals engage in behavior to get something or to get out of something.  When trying to identify the function of a behavior, it is often helpful to think, "What purpose is this behavior serving the individual?" Described below are the common functions of behavior.

==== Obtain socially mediated events ====

''Access to attention (positive reinforcement: social)'':
The individual engages in the behavior to obtain attention from another person. For example, a child throws a toy because it characteristically results in mom's attention. (If this behavior results in mom looking at child and giving him lots of attention—even if she's saying "NO"—he will be more likely to engage in the same behavior in the future to get mom's attention.) Common forms of attention include, but are not limited to, hugs, kisses, reprimands, frowns, smiles, etc.

''Access to tangibles (positive reinforcement: tangible/activity)'':
The individual engages in the behavior to obtain a specific item or engage in a specific activity from another person. For example, a child hits mom because s/he wants the toy mom is holding. (If this behavior results in mom giving the child the toy, s/he will be more likely to engage in the same behavior in the future to get mom's attention.) Common forms of tangible items include, but are not limited to, food, toys, movies, video games, etc.

''Automatic positive reinforcement'':
The individual engages in the behavior because the response-produced stimulation possesses reinforcing characteristics. In other words, engaging in the behavior produces reinforcing stimulation unique to the specific context. For example, a child hits his/her eyes because it produces the specific stimulation of various colors and effects. Another example includes a child spinning a bowl on a table to produce the specific auditory stimulation unique to that object. Common forms of automatic stimulation include, but are not limited to, auditory stimulation, visual stimulation, endorphin release, etc.

==== Escape/avoid undesirable events (negative reinforcement) ====

===== Escape/avoid socially mediated events =====

''Escape/removal of attention'':
The individual engages in the behavior to escape aversive socially mediated attention. Put another way, social situations that are aversive to the child are removed contingent on the behavior occurring. For example, a child hits the teacher to avoid talking in front of the class. Common forms of aversive social situations include, but are not limited to, smiles, hugs, frowns, corrections, group settings, etc.

''Escape/removal of tasks or activities'':
The individual engages in the behavior to escape aversive tasks or demands. For example, when a child is told to take a bath he begins to cry, and his mother tells him he no longer has to take a bath. Another example includes a teacher telling a student to complete a set of worksheets, to which the student flips the desk and is sent to the principal's office. Being sent to the principal's office reinforced the behavior of flipping the desk because it allowed the child to escape the aversive activity of completing the worksheets. Common forms of aversive demands/activities include, but are not limited to, difficult tasks, changes in routines, unpredictability, etc.

===== Escape/avoid specific stimulation =====

''Automatic negative reinforcement'':
The individual engages in the behavior because it produces a decrease in aversive stimulation. Put another way, something aversive is occurring in some location on the organism's body, and engaging in the behavior decreases the level of discomfort. For example, a child bangs his head against the wall to decrease the pain experienced from a toothache. Another example includes a child scratching his arm to decrease the level of itchiness experienced from a bug bite. Common forms of aversive stimulation abated by engaging in specific behaviors include sinus pain, itching, hunger, etc.

=== Function versus topography ===

As previously stated function refers to the effect the behavior produces on the environment. The actual form of the behavior is referred to the topography. Different behaviors may serve the same function, thus describing one limitation of treating behaviors based on form alone. For example, a child may scream, hit, and cry to obtain attention from his mother. What the behavior looks like often reveals little useful information about the conditions that account for it. However, identifying the conditions that account for a behavior, suggests what conditions need to be altered to change the behavior. Therefore, assessment of function of a behavior can yield useful information with respect to intervention strategies that are likely to be effective.

=== Method of identifying functions of behavior ===

'''FBA methods can be classified into three types''':
* Indirect assessment
* Descriptive assessment
* Functional (experimental) analysis

==== Indirect FBA ====

This method uses structured interviews, checklists, rating scales, or questionnaires to obtain information from persons who are familiar with the person exhibiting the behavior to identify possible conditions or events in the natural environment that correlate with the problem behavior. They are referred to as "indirect" because they do not involve direct observation of the behavior, but rather they solicit information based on others' recollections of the behavior. This form of assessment typically yields the least reliable information about the function of behavior, but can provide insight as to possible functions of the behavior to be tested in the future, the form of the behaviors (e.g. screaming, hitting, etc.), and environments in which the behavior typically occurs (e.g. school, home, etc.). This type of assessment should be performed as the initial step of any functional behavior assessment to gather relevant information to complete more direct assessments.

==== Descriptive FBA ====

Unlike the indirect methods of FBAs, descriptive functional behavior assessment employs direct observation of behavior. These observations occur in the environment in which the behavior naturally occurs (e.g. school, home, etc.) therefore there is no direct manipulation of the environment.
The most common form of descriptive assessment involves recording the antecedents and consequences that naturally occur when the individual emits the behavior. This is referred to as ABC data collection, in which (A) represents the common antecedent, (B) represents the behavior of interest, and (C) represents the immediate consequences that occur following the behavior. ABC data collection is used to identify the naturally occurring consequences delivered in the environment in which the behavior occurs. ABC data collection can be conducted by a wide array of individuals who have received appropriate training on how to record the data.
Another form of descriptive FBA is called a scatterplot. In this assessment, staff record the time and setting in which the behavior of interest occurs over a series of days. The data are plotted on a visual scale to indicate whether there are any patterns in the behavior (for example, if the behavior occurs more frequently during math instruction than it does during lunchtime). Although this assessment does not indicate the consequences maintaining the behavior, it can be used to identify some of the antecedent conditions that typically precede the behavior of interest.

==== Functional (experimental) analysis ====

A functional analysis is the most direct form of functional behavior assessment, in which specific antecedents and consequences are systematically manipulated to test their separate effects on the behavior of interest. Each manipulation of the antecedent and consequence in a particular situation is referred to a condition. In a functional analysis, conditions are typically alternated between quite rapidly independent of responding to test the different functions of behavior. When data paths are elevated above the control condition (described below) it can be said that there is a functional relation between that condition and the behavior of interest. Complexity, time restraints, and setting restraints, are a few limitations to this particular method. When deciding to use this method, it should be noted that there is a chance of high-risk behavior and the possibility of low-rate behaviors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://autism.outreach.psu.edu/sites/omcphplive.outreach.psu.edu.drpms.autismconference/files/42%20and%2055%20Presentation.pdf | title=Functional Analysis of Problem Behavior: the Basics | date=2010 | author=Brian A.

Below, common examples of experimental conditions are described.
A standard functional analysis normally has four conditions (three test conditions and one control).

===== Attention =====

In this condition, the experimenter gives the individual moderately preferred items and instructs them to go play. After that initial instruction, the experimenter pretends to act busy and ignores all bids for attention from the individual. If the individual engages in the behavior of interest, the experimenter provides the individual with attention (commonly in the form of a reprimand). Behaviors that occur more frequently in this condition can be said to be attention maintained.

===== Escape =====

In this condition, the experimenter instructs the individual that it is time to work. After the initial instruction, the experimenter delivers a series of demands that the individual is typically required to complete (e.g. math problems, cleaning up, etc.). If the individual engages in the behavior of interest, the demand is removed and the child is allowed to take a break. Behaviors that occur more frequently in this condition can be said to be escape maintained.

===== Alone =====
In this condition, the child is left alone with a variety of items to engage with. If the child engages in the behavior of interest, no programmed consequences are delivered. Behaviors that occur more frequently in this condition can be said to be automatically maintained.

===== Control (play) =====

In this condition, the child is allowed to engage with a variety of items during the session. No demands are placed on the child throughout the duration of the session. The experimenter provides attention to the individual throughout the session on any behavior that is not the target behavior. If the target behavior occurs, the experimenter removes attention until the behavior has subsided. This session is meant to act as a control condition, meaning that the environment is enriched for the purpose of the behavior not occurring. Said another way, by meeting environmental needs for all possible functions, the individual is not likely to engage in the behavior of interest. This condition is used as a comparison to the other conditions. Any condition that is elevated to a large degree form the control condition, shows a higher degree experimental control indicating the functional relationship between the specific environmental conditions and the behavior of interest.

===Conducting a functional behavior assessment===

Functional behavior assessments are rarely limited to only one of the methods described above. The most common, and most preferred, method for identifying the function of behavior can be seen as a four-part processes.
# The gathering of information via indirect and descriptive assessment.
# Interpretation of information from indirect and descriptive assessment and formulation of a hypothesis about the purpose of problem behavior.
# Testing of a hypothesis using a functional analysis.
# Developing intervention options based on the function of problem behavior.

===Task analysis===

[[Task analysis]] is a process in which a task is analyzed into its component parts so that those parts can be taught through the use of chaining: [[forward chaining]], [[Backward chaining (applied behavior analysis)|backward chaining]] and total task presentation. Task analysis has been used in organizational behavior management, a behavior analytic approach to changing the behaviors of members of an organization (e.g., factories, offices, or hospitals).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Crowell, C.R. |author2=Anderson, D.C. |author3=Abel, D.M. |author4=Sergio, J.P. |year=1988 |title=Task clarification, performance feedback, and social praise: procedures for improving the customer service of bank tellers |journal=[[J Appl Behav Anal]] |volume=21 |issue=1 |pages= 65–71 |doi=10.1901/jaba.1988.21-65 |pmid=16795713 |pmc=1286094}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Behavioral script]]s often emerge from a task analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1901/jaba.1993.26-89 |author1=MacDuff, G.S. |author2=Krantz, P.J. |author3=McClannahan, L.E. |year=1993 |title=Teaching children with autism to use photographic activity schedules: Maintenance and generalization of complex response chains |journal=Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis |volume=26 |issue=1 |pages=89–97 |pmid=8473261 |pmc=1297722}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1901/jaba.1993.26-121 |author1=Krantz, P.J. |author2=McClannahan, L.E. |year=1993 |title=Teaching children with autism to initiate to peers: Effects of a script-fading procedure |journal=Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis |volume=26 |issue=1 |pages=121–32 |pmid=8473251 |pmc=1297725}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bergan conducted a task analysis of the behavioral consultation relationship&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Bergan, J.R. |year=1977 |title=Behavioral Consultation |publisher=Merrill |isbn=0-675-08488-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Thomas Kratochwill developed a training program based on teaching Bergan's skills.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Kratochwill, T.R. |author2=Van Someren, K.R. |author3=Sheridan, S.M. |year=1989 |title=Training behavioral consultants: a competency-based model to teach interview skills |journal=Professional School Psychology |volume=4 |pages=41–58 |doi=10.1037/h0090570}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar approach was used for the development of microskills training for counselors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Ivey, A.E. |author2=Normington, C.J. |author3=Miller, C.D. |author4=Morrill, W.H. |author5=Haase, R.F. |year=1968 |title=Microcounseling and attending behavior: an approach to prepracticum counselor training |journal=[[J Couns Psychol]] |volume=15 |issue=5, pt. 2 |pages=1–12 |doi=10.1037/h0026129}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Ivey, A.E. |author2=Ivey, M.B. |year=1998 |title=Intentional Interviewing and Counseling: Facilitating Client Development in a Multicultural Society |edition=4th |publisher=Brooks/Cole |isbn=0-534-35756-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Iwata, B.A. |author2=Wong, S.E. |author3=Riordan, M.M. |author4=Dorsey, M.F. |author5=Lau, M.M. |year=1982 |title=Assessment and training of clinical interviewing skills: Analogue analysis and field replication |journal=Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis |pmid=7118753 |volume=15 |issue=2 |pages=191–203 |doi=10.1901/jaba.1982.15-191 |pmc=1308264}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ivey would later call this "behaviorist" phase a very productive one&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=J Couns Dev |year=2001 |volume=79 |issue=1 |pages=105–18 |title=Allen E.

===Chaining===
{{Main article|Chaining}}

The skill to be learned is broken down into small units for easy learning. For example, a person learning to brush teeth independently may start with learning to unscrew the toothpaste cap. Once they have learned this, the next step may be squeezing the tube, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cooper|Heron|Heward|1987}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Weiss, K.M. |year=1978 |title=A comparison of forward and backward procedures for the acquisition of response chains in humans |journal=J Exp Anal Behav |volume=29 |issue=2 |pages=255–59 |doi=10.1901/jeab.1978.29-255 |pmid=16812053 |pmc=1332753}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For problem behavior, chains can also be analyzed and the chain can be disrupted to prevent the problem behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Walker, H.M. |year=1995 |title=The Acting-Out Child: Coping With Classroom Disruption |edition=2nd |publisher=Sopris West |isbn=1-57035-047-7}}{{page needed|date=August 2011}}&lt;!-- Please add chapter= or pages= for this citation. --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Some behavior therapies, such as [[dialectical behavior therapy]], make extensive use of behavior chain analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Linehan, M.M. |year=1993 |title=Skills Training Manual for Treating Borderline Personality Disorder |publisher=The Guilford Press |isbn=0-89862-034-1}}{{page needed|date=August 2011}}&lt;!-- Please add chapter= or pages= for this citation. --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Prompting===

A [[Response Prompting Procedures|prompt]] is a cue that is used to encourage a desired response from an individual.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Ontario Ministry of Education |year=2007 |title=Effective Educational Practices for Students with ASD |publisher=Queen's Printer for Ontario}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prompts are often categorized into a prompt hierarchy from most intrusive to least intrusive, although there is some controversy about what is considered most intrusive, those that are physically intrusive or those that are hardest prompt to fade (e.g.,verbal).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Barnett, D.W. |year=2006 |title=Preschool Intervention Scripts: Lessons from 20 years of Research and Practice |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_6888/is_2_2/ai_n28461339/ |journal=Journal of Speech Language Pathology and Applied Behavior Analysis |volume=2 |issue=2 |pages=158–81 |doi=10.1037/h0100216|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to minimize errors and ensure a high level of success during learning, prompts are given in a most-to-least sequence and faded systematically.&lt;ref name="Martin &amp; Pear 2003"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Martin |last2=Pear |year=2003 |title=Behavior Modification: What is it and how to do it? |edition=7th |location=Upper Saddle River NJ |publisher=Pearson Education}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this process, prompts are faded quickly as possible so that the learner does not come to depend on them and eventually behaves appropriately without prompting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=VanDerHeyden, A.M. |author2=Snyder, P. |author3=DiCarlo, C.F. |author4=Stricklin, S.B. |author5=Vagianos, L.A. |year=2002 |title=Comparison of within-stimulus and extra-stimulus prompts to increase targeted play behaviors in an inclusive early intervention program |journal=Behav Analyst Today |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_6884/is_2_3/ai_n28132946/ |volume=3 |issue=2 |pages=188–97 |doi=10.1037/h0099967}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Chesnut, M. |author2=Williamson, P.N. |author3=Morrow, J.E. |year=2003 |title=The use of visual cues to teach receptive skills to children with severe auditory discrimination deficits |journal=Behav Analyst Today |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_6884/is_2_4/ai_n28173253/ |volume=4 |issue=2 |pages=212–24 |doi=10.1037/h0100120}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Types of prompts'''
Prompters might use any or all of the following to suggest the desired response:
* Vocal prompts: Words or other vocalizations
* Visual prompts: A visual cue or picture
* Gestural prompts: A physical gesture
* Positional prompt: e.g., the target item is placed close to the individual.
* Modeling: Modeling the desired response. This type of prompt is best suited for individuals who learn through imitation and can attend to a model.
* Physical prompts: Physically manipulating the individual to produce the desired response. There are many degrees of physical prompts, from quite intrusive (e.g. the teacher places a hand on the learner's hand) to minimally intrusive (e.g. a slight tap).&lt;ref name="Martin &amp; Pear 2003"/&gt;

This is not an exhaustive list of prompts; the nature, number, and order of prompts are chosen to be the most effective for a particular individual.

===Fading===

The overall goal is for an individual to eventually not need prompts. As an individual gains mastery of a skill at a particular prompt level, the prompt is faded to a less intrusive prompt. This ensures that the individual does not become overly dependent on a particular prompt when learning a new behavior or skill.

===Thinning a reinforcement schedule===

Thinning is often confused with fading. Fading refers to a prompt being removed, where thinning refers to an increase in the time or number of responses required between reinforcements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=LeBlanc, L.A. |author2=Hagoplan, L.P. |author3=Maglieri, K.A. |author4=Poling, A. |year=2002 |title=Decreasing the intensity of reinforcement-based interventions for reducing behavior: conceptual issues and a proposed model for clinical practice |journal=Behav Analyst Today |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_6884/is_3_3/ai_n28132960/ |volume=3 |issue=3 |pages=289–300 |doi=10.1037/h0099991}}&lt;/ref&gt; Periodic thinning that produces a 30% decrease in reinforcement has been suggested as an efficient way to thin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Cautilli, J. |year=2005 |title=Brief report: application of proposed model of decreasing reinforcement intensity |journal=Int J Behav Consult Ther |url= http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_6886/is_1_1/ai_n28321102/ |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=21–36 |doi=10.1037/h0100731}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schedule thinning is often an important and neglected issue in [[contingency management]] and [[token economy]] systems, especially when these are developed by unqualified practitioners (see [[professional practice of behavior analysis]]).&lt;ref&gt;Bailey, J.S. &amp; Burch, M.R. (2005). ''Ethics for behavior analysts.'' LEA&lt;/ref&gt;

===Generalization===

Generalization is the expansion of a student's performance ability beyond the initial conditions set for acquisition of a skill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Alberto  |last2=Troutman |year=2006 |title=Applied behavior analysis for teachers |edition=7th  |location=Upper Saddle River NJ |publisher=Pearson Education}}&lt;/ref&gt; Generalization can occur across people, places, and materials used for teaching. For example, once a skill is learned in one setting, with a particular instructor, and with specific materials, the skill is taught in more general settings with more variation from the initial acquisition phase. For example, if a student has successfully mastered learning colors at the table, the teacher may take the student around the house or his school and then ''generalize'' the skill in these more natural environments with other materials. Behavior analysts have spent considerable amount of time studying factors that lead to generalization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Osnes, P.G. |author2=Lieblein, T. |year=2003 |title=An explicit technology of generalization |journal=Behav Analyst Today |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_6884/is_4_3/ai_n28132927/ |volume=3 |issue=4 |pages=364–74 |doi=10.1037/h0099994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Shaping===
{{Main article|Shaping (psychology)}}

Shaping involves gradually modifying the existing behavior into the desired behavior. If the student engages with a dog by hitting it, then he or she could have their behavior shaped by reinforcing interactions in which he or she touches the dog more gently. Over many interactions, successful shaping would replace the hitting behavior with patting or other gentler behavior. Shaping is based on a behavior analyst's thorough knowledge of [[operant conditioning]] principles and [[extinction (psychology)|extinction]]. Recent efforts to teach shaping have used simulated computer tasks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Kemp, S.M. |author2=Eckerman, D.A. |year=2002 |title=Simulating a shaping task |journal=Behav Analyst Today |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_6884/is_2_3/ai_n28132944/ |volume=3 |issue=2 |pages=166–78 |doi=10.1037/h0099975}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One teaching technique found to be effective with some students, particularly children, is the use of video modeling (the use of taped sequences as exemplars of behavior). It can be used by therapists to assist in the acquisition of both verbal and [[voluntary action|motor]] responses, in some cases for long [[chaining|chains]] of behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=D'Ateno, P. |author2=Mangiapanello, K. |author3=Taylor, B.A. |year= 2002 |title=Using video modeling to teach complex play sequences to a preschooler with autism |journal=J Posit Behav Interv |volume=5 |issue=1 |pages=5–11 |doi=10.1177/10983007030050010801}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Corbett, B.A. |author2=Abdullah, M. |year=2005 |title=Video modeling: why does it work for children with autism? |journal=J Early Intensive Behav Interv |volume=2 |issue=1 |pages=2–8 |doi=10.1037/h0100294}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Interventions based on an FBA===

Critical to behavior analytic interventions is the concept of a systematic behavioral [[case formulation]] with a functional behavioral assessment or analysis at the core.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Tryon, W.W. |year=1976 |title=A system of behavioral diagnosis |journal=[[Prof Psychol]] |volume=7 |issue=4 |pages=495–506 |doi=10.1037/0735-7028.7.4.495}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Kanfer, F.H. |author2=Saslow, G. |year=1969 |chapter=Behavioral diagnosis |editor=Franks CM |title=Behavior Therapy: Appraisal and Status |publisher=McGraw-Hill |pages=417–44 |oclc=24223}}&lt;/ref&gt; This approach should apply a behavior analytic [[theory of change]] (see [[Behavioral change theories]]). This formulation should include a thorough functional assessment, a skills assessment, a sequential analysis (behavior chain analysis), an ecological assessment, a look at existing evidenced-based behavioral models for the problem behavior (such as Fordyce's model of chronic pain)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Romano, J.M. |author2=Jensen, M.P. |author3=Turner, J.A. |author4=Good, A.B. |author5=Hops, H. |year=2000 |title=Chronic pain patient-partner interactions: further support for a behavioral model of chronic pain |journal=Behav Ther |volume=31 |issue=3 |doi=10.1016/S0005-7894(00)80023-4 |pages=415–40}}&lt;/ref&gt; and then a treatment plan based on how environmental factors influence behavior. Some argue that behavior analytic case formulation can be improved with an assessment of rules and rule-governed behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Malott, R.W. |year=1992 |title=A theory of rule-governed behavior and organizational behavior management |journal=J Organ Behav Manage |volume=12 |issue=2 |pages=45–65 |doi= 10.1300/J075v12n02_03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Malott, R.W. |author2=Shimamune, S. |author3=Malott, M.E. |year=1992 |title=Rule-governed behavior and organizational behavior management: an analysis of interventions |journal=J Organ Behav Manage |volume=12 |issue=2 |pages=103–16 |doi=10.1300/J075v12n02_09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Hayes, S.C. |author2=Brownstein, A.J. |author3=Zettle, R.D. |author4=Rosenfarb, I. |author5=Korn, Z. |year=1986 |title=Rule-governed behavior and sensitivity to changing consequences of responding |journal=J Exp Anal Behav |volume=45 |issue=3 |pages=237–56 |doi=10.1901/jeab.1986.45-237 |pmid=16812448 |pmc=1348236}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the interventions that result from this type of conceptualization involve training specific communication skills to replace the problem behaviors as well as specific setting, antecedent, behavior, and consequence strategies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Gerhardt, P.F. |author2=Weiss, M.J. |author3=Delmolino, L. |year=2003 |title=Treatment of severe aggression in an adolescent with autism: non-contingent reinforcement and functional communication training |journal=Behav Analyst Today |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_6884/is_4_4/ai_n28173265/ |volume=4 |issue=4 |pages=386–94 |doi=10.1037/h0100124}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* A 2007 clinical report of the [[American Academy of Pediatrics]] concluded that the benefit of ABA-based interventions in autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) "has been well documented" and that "children who receive early intensive behavioral treatment have been shown to make substantial, sustained gains in IQ, language, academic performance, and [[adaptive behavior]] as well as some measures of social behavior".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Pediatrics |year=2007 |volume=120 |issue=5 |pages=1162–82 |title=Management of children with autism spectrum disorders |author1=Myers, S.M. |author2=Johnson, C.P. |author3=Council on Children with Disabilities |doi=10.1542/peds.2007-2362 |pmid=17967921 |url=http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/cgi/content/full/120/5/1162 |laysummary=http://aap.org/advocacy/releases/oct07autism.htm |laysource=AAP |laydate=2007-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Researchers from the [[MIND Institute]] published an evidence-based review of comprehensive treatment approaches in 2008. On the basis of "the strength of the findings from the four best-designed, controlled studies", they were of the opinion that one ABA-based approach (the [[Lovaas technique]] created by [[Ole Ivar Løvaas]]) is "well-established" for improving intellectual performance of young children with ASD.&lt;ref name=Rogers2008&gt;{{cite journal |journal=J Clin Child Adolesc Psychol |year=2008 |volume=37 |issue=1 |pages=8–38 |title=Evidence-based comprehensive treatments for early autism |author1=Rogers, S.J. |author2=Vismara, L.A. |doi=10.1080/15374410701817808 |pmc=2943764 |pmid=18444052}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* A 2009 review of psycho-educational interventions for children with autism whose mean age was six years or less at intake found that five high-quality ("Level 1" or "Level 2") studies assessed ABA-based treatments. On the basis of these and other studies, the author concluded that ABA is "well-established" and is "demonstrated effective in enhancing global functioning in pre-school children with autism when treatment is intensive and carried out by trained therapists".&lt;ref name=Eikeseth2009&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Res Dev Disabil |volume=30 |issue=1 |pages=158–78 |year=2009 |title=Outcome of comprehensive psycho-educational interventions for young children with autism |author=Eikeseth, S. |doi=10.1016/j.ridd.2008.02.003 |pmid=18385012|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/5467678_Outcome_of_comprehensive_psycho-educational_interventions_for_young_children_with_autism}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the review committee also concluded that "there is a great need for more knowledge about which interventions are most effective".
* A 2009 paper included a descriptive analysis, an effect size analysis, and a [[meta-analysis]] of 13 reports published from 1987 to 2007 of early intensive behavioral intervention (EIBI, a form of ABA-based treatment with origins in the Lovaas technique) for autism. It determined that EIBI's effect sizes were "generally positive" for IQ, adaptive behavior, expressive language, and receptive language. The paper did note limitations of its findings including the lack of published comparisons between EIBI and other "empirically validated treatment programs".&lt;ref name=Reichow2009&gt;{{cite journal |journal=J Autism Dev Disord |volume=39 |issue=1 |pages=23–41 |year=2009 |title=Comprehensive synthesis of early intensive behavioral interventions for young children with autism based on the UCLA Young Autism Project model |author1=Reichow, B. |author2=Wolery, M. |doi=10.1007/s10803-008-0596-0 |pmid=18535894}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In a 2009 [[systematic review]] of 11 studies published from 1987 to 2007, the researchers wrote "there is strong evidence that EIBI is effective for some, but not all, children with autism spectrum disorders, and there is wide variability in response to treatment". Furthermore, any improvements are likely to be greatest in the first year of intervention.&lt;ref name=Howlin2009&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Howlin, P. |author2=Magiati, I. |author3=Charman, T. |editor=MacLean, Jr. |editor2=William E. |title=Systematic review of early intensive behavioral interventions for children with autism |journal=Am J Intellect Dev Disabil |volume=114 |issue=1 |pages=23–41 |year=2009 |pmid=19143460 |doi=10.1352/2009.114:23-41}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* A 2009 meta-analysis of nine studies published from 1987 to 2007 concluded that EIBI has a "large" effect on full-scale intelligence and a "moderate" effect on adaptive behavior in autistic children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Eldevik, S. |author2=Hastings, R.P. |author3=Hughes, J.C. |author4=Jahr, E. |author5=Eikeseth, S. |author6=Cross, S. |title=Meta-analysis of Early Intensive Behavioral Intervention for children with autism |journal=J Clin Child Adolesc Psychol |volume=38 |issue=3 |pages=439–50 |year=2009 |pmid=19437303 |doi=10.1080/15374410902851739}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 2011, investigators from [[Vanderbilt University]] under contract with the [[Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality]] performed a comprehensive review of the scientific literature on ABA-based and other therapies for autism spectrum disorders; the ABA-based therapies included the [[University of California, Los Angeles|UCLA]]/Lovaas method and the Early Start Denver Model (the latter developed by Sally Rogers and [[Geraldine Dawson]]).&lt;ref name=VanderbiltAHRQ2011&gt;{{cite book |author1=Warren, Z. |author2=Veenstra-VanderWeele, J. |author3=Stone, W. |author4=Bruzek, J.L. |author5=Nahmias, A.S. |author6=Foss-Feig, J.H. |author7=Jerome, R.N. |author8=Krishnaswami, S. |author9=Sathe, N.A. |author10=Glasser, A.M. |author11=Surawicz, T. |author12=McPheeters, M.L. |title=Therapies for children with autism spectrum disorders |year=2011 |url=http://www.effectivehealthcare.ahrq.gov/ehc/products/106/656/CER26_Autism_Report_04-14-2011.pdf |series=AHRQ Publication No. 11-EHC029-EF, Comparative Effectiveness Review No. 26 |publisher=Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality |location=Rockville, MD |access-date=15 July 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111002035802/http://www.effectivehealthcare.ahrq.gov/ehc/products/106/656/CER26_Autism_Report_04-14-2011.pdf |archive-date=2 October 2011 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; They concluded that "both approaches were associated with ... improvements in cognitive performance, language skills, and adaptive behavior skills".&lt;ref name=VanderbiltAHRQ2011/&gt;{{rp|ES-9}} However, they also concluded that "the strength of evidence ... is low", "many children continue to display prominent areas of impairment", "subgroups may account for a majority of the change", there is "little evidence of practical effectiveness or feasibility beyond research studies", and the published studies "used small samples, different treatment approaches and duration, and different outcome measurements".&lt;ref name=VanderbiltAHRQ2011/&gt;{{rp|ES-10}}

A 2009 systematic review and meta-analysis by Spreckley and Boyd of four small-n 2000–2007 studies (involving a total of 76 children) came to different conclusions than the aforementioned reviews.&lt;ref name= Spreckley2009&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Spreckley, M. |author2=Boyd, R. |title=Efficacy of applied behavioral intervention in preschool children with autism for improving cognitive, language, and adaptive behavior: a systematic review and meta-analysis |journal=J Pediatr |volume=154 |issue=3 |pages=338–44 |year=2009 |pmid=18950798 |doi=10.1016/j.jpeds.2008.09.012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spreckley and Boyd reported that applied behavior intervention (ABI), another name for EIBI, did not significantly improve outcomes compared with standard care of preschool children with ASD in the areas of cognitive outcome, expressive language, receptive language, and adaptive behavior.&lt;ref name=Spreckley2009/&gt; In a letter to the editor, however, authors of the four studies meta-analyzed claimed that Spreckley and Boyd had misinterpreted one study comparing two forms of ABI with each other as a comparison of ABI with standard care, which erroneously decreased the observed efficacy of ABI.&lt;ref name=Smith2009&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Smith, T. |author2=Eikeseth, S. |author3=Sallows, G.O. |author4=Graupner, T.D. |title=Efficacy of applied behavior analysis in autism |journal=J Pediatr |volume=155 |issue=1 |pages=151–52; author reply 152–53 |year=2009 |pmid=19559310 |doi=10.1016/j.jpeds.2009.01.065}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the four studies' authors raised the possibility that Spreckley and Boyd had excluded some other studies unnecessarily, and that including such studies could have led to a more favorable evaluation of ABI.&lt;ref name=Smith2009/&gt; Spreckley, Boyd, and the four studies' authors did agree that large multi-site [[randomized trial]]s are needed to improve the understanding of ABA's efficacy in autism.&lt;ref name=Smith2009/&gt; Some initial, theoretical work has been initiated to use applied behavioral analysis (ABA) as a foundation for agent-mediated, AI-based instructions for children with autism spectrum disorder.&lt;ref name="Begoli, PRS-ABA, ABA Ontology"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Begoli|first1=Edmon|title=Procedural-Reasoning Architecture for Applied Behavior Analysis-based Instructions|date=May 2014|publisher=University of Tennessee, Knoxville|location=Knoxville, Tennessee, USA|pages=44–79|url=http://trace.tennessee.edu/utk_graddiss/2749|accessdate=14 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A United States District Court Judge ruled withholding ABA from children (0–21) with autism causes irreparable harm, finding Elizabeth Dudek of Florida's Agency for Healthcare Administration's position suggesting ABA was experimental was arbitrary and capricious, ordering AHCA enjoined from withholding ABA.&lt;ref&gt;[http://autism-u.com/helpdoc/Order-Case-No-11-20684-CIV.PDF Permanent Injunction Order]&lt;/ref&gt;  Thereafter, CMS ordered its guidance that all states to cover ABA via [[Head Start (program)|Head Start]] and [[Early Head Start]] EPSDT programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.medicaid.gov/Federal-Policy-Guidance/Downloads/CIB-07-07-14.pdf | title=CMCS Informational Bulletin: Clarification of Medicaid Coverage of Services to Children with Autism | publisher=Department of Health &amp; Human Services | date=July 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Further research is clearly required, specifically to include larger and thus more representative samples.

===Criticism===
Conversely, various major figures within the autistic community have written biographies detailing harm caused by the provision of ABA. Several of these people have since been diagnosed with [[PTSD]] and [[Major depressive disorder|depression]]. Less scholarly reviews were provided by [[Elizabeth DeVita-Raeburn|Elizabeth Devita-Raeburn]] in ''[[The Atlantic]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2016/08/aba-autism-controversy/495272/|title=Is the Most Common Therapy for Autism Cruel?|first=Elizabeth|last=DeVita-Raeburn|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; magazine and by an ex-practitioner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sociallyanxiousadvocate.wordpress.com/2015/05/22/why-i-left-aba/|title=Why I Left ABA|first= Anxious |last=Advocate |website=sociallyanxiousadvocate.wordpress.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Controversy regarding ABA persists in the autism community. A 2017 study, based on a survey of 'post-traumatic stress symptoms' completed by individuals with presumed, self-reported diagnosis of ASD and their caregivers, found that 46% of the individuals who also reported receiving ABA treatment met the author's "diagnostic threshold for PTSD" via their survey score, versus 28% of respondents not reporting receipt of ABA treatment. Individuals reported as receiving ABA were 86% more likely on average (41% for adults, 130% for children) to meet the author's "diagnostic threshold".&lt;ref&gt;Henny Kupferstein. Evidence of increased PTSD symptoms in autism exposed to applied behavior analysis . "Advances in Autism". 4 (1), pp. 19-29, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the 2017 study was heavily criticized by peer reviewers who noted, among other things, that her methods for recruiting participants were faulty, she did not use appropriate operative definitions for PTSS versus PTSD, and there was detected bias baked into the hypothesis of the study.&lt;ref&gt;Justin Barrett Leaf.

An '''Archimedean point''' (or "Punctum Archimedis") is a hypothetical vantage point from which an observer can objectively perceive the subject of inquiry, with a view of totality.  The ideal of "removing oneself" from the object of study so that one can see it in relation to all other things, but remain independent of them, is described by a view from an Archimedean point.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803095422175 Archimedean Point]. [[Oxford Reference - Oxford University Press]]. Retrieved 18 April 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, the philosopher [[John Rawls]] uses the [[heuristic]] device of the [[original position]] in an attempt to remove the particular [[biases]] of individual [[agency (philosophy)|agents]] in an attempt to demonstrate how [[Rational Choice Theory|rational beings]] might arrive at an [[objectivity (philosophy)|objective]] formulation of [[justice]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/communitarianism/#UniVerPar Communitarianism]. [[Stanford Encyclopaedia of Philosophy]]. Retrieved 15 February 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

The expression comes from [[Archimedes]], who supposedly claimed that he could lift the [[Earth]] off its foundation if he were given a place to stand, one solid point, and a long enough lever.  This is also mentioned in Descartes' second meditation with regard to finding certainty, the 'unmovable point' Archimedes sought.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Quotations about Archimedes Lever | url = http://www.math.nyu.edu/~crorres/Archimedes/Lever/LeverQuotes.html | accessdate = 2009-01-23| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090126130558/http://www.math.nyu.edu/~crorres/Archimedes/Lever/LeverQuotes.html| archivedate= 26 January 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sceptical]] and [[anti-realist]] philosophers criticise the possibility of an Archimedean point, claiming it is a form of [[scientism]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803095422175 Archimedean Point].

'''Bio-energy with carbon capture and storage''' ('''BECCS''') is a potential [[climate change mitigation|greenhouse gas mitigation]] technology which produces [[negative carbon dioxide emission]]s by combining [[bioenergy]] (energy from [[biomass]]) use with [[Geology|geologic]] [[carbon capture and storage]].&lt;ref name=Obersteiner&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1126/science.294.5543.786b |title=Managing Climate Risk |year=2001 |last1=Obersteiner |first1=M. |journal=Science |volume=294 |issue=5543 |pages=786–7 |pmid=11681318}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of BECCS is drawn from the integration of trees and crops, which extract [[carbon dioxide]] (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) from the atmosphere as they grow, the use of this biomass in processing industries or power plants, and the application of [[carbon capture and storage]] via CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; injection into geological formations.&lt;ref name="Global Status of BECCS Projects 2010"&gt;{{Cite web

In the [[IPCC Fourth Assessment Report]] by the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] (IPCC), BECCS was indicated as a key technology for reaching low carbon dioxide atmospheric concentration targets.&lt;ref name=IPCC2007&gt;{{cite book |first1=Brian |last1=Fisher |first2=Nebojsa |last2=Nakicenovic |first3=Knut |last3=Alfsen |first4=Jan Corfee |last4=Morlot |first5=Francisco |last5=de la Chesnaye |first6=Jean-Charles |last6=Hourcade |first7=Kejun |last7=Jiang |first8=Mikiko |last8=Kainuma |first9=Emilio |last9=La Rovere |chapter=Issues related to mitigation in the long-term context |chapterurl=http://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar4/wg3/ar4-wg3-chapter3.pdf |pages=169–250 |editor1-first=Bert |editor1-last=Metz |title=Climate Change 2007: Mitigation of Climate Change |series=Working Group III contribution to the Fourth Assessment Report of the IPCC |isbn=978-0-521-88011-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The negative emissions that can be produced by BECCS has been estimated by the [[Royal Society]] to be equivalent to a 50 to 150 [[Parts per million|ppm]] decrease in [[Carbon dioxide in the Earth's atmosphere|global atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations]]&lt;ref name=RoyalSociety&gt;{{Cite web

==Negative emission==

{{See also|Carbon sink|Negative carbon dioxide emission}}

[[Image:Carbon flow.jpg|thumb|400px|Carbon flow schematic for different energy systems.]]

The main appeal of BECCS is in its ability to result in negative emissions of [[carbon dioxide|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]]. The capture of carbon dioxide from [[bioenergy]] sources effectively removes CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; from the atmosphere.&lt;ref name=read&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.energy.2004.07.003 |title=Bio-energy with carbon storage (BECS): A sequential decision approach to the threat of abrupt climate change |year=2005 |last1=Read |first1=Peter |last2=Lermit |first2=Jonathan |journal=Energy |volume=30 |issue=14 |pages=2654}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bio-energy is derived from biomass which is a [[renewable energy source]] and serves as a carbon sink during its growth. During industrial processes, the biomass combusted or processed re-releases the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; into the atmosphere. The process thus results in a net zero emission of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, though this may be positively or negatively altered depending on the carbon emissions associated with biomass growth, transport and processing, see below under environmental considerations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/bbb.3 |title=Food and fuel for all: Realistic or foolish? |year=2007 |last1=g. Cassman |first1=Kenneth |last2=Liska |first2=Adam J. |journal=Biofuels, Bioproducts and Biorefining |volume=1 |pages=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Carbon capture and storage]] (CCS) technology serves to intercept the release of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; into the atmosphere and redirect it into geological storage locations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0961-9534(03)00013-8 |title=Potential market niches for biomass energy with CO2 capture and storage—Opportunities for energy supply with negative CO2 emissions |year=2003 |last1=Möllersten |first1=Kenneth |last2=Yan |first2=Jinyue |last3=r. Moreira |first3=Jose |journal=Biomass and Bioenergy |volume=25 |issue=3 |pages=273}}&lt;/ref&gt; CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; with a biomass origin is not only released from biomass fuelled power plants, but also during the production of [[Pulp (paper)|pulp]] used to make paper and in the production of biofuels such as [[biogas]] and [[bioethanol]]. The BECCS technology can also be employed on such industrial processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0360-5442(03)00002-1 |title=Potential and cost-effectiveness of CO2 reductions through energy measures in Swedish pulp and paper mills |year=2003 |last1=Möllersten |first1=K. |last2=Yan |first2=J. |last3=Westermark |first3=M. |journal=Energy |volume=28 |issue=7 |pages=691}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is argued that through the BECCS technology, carbon dioxide is trapped in geologic formations for very long periods of time, whereas for example a tree only stores its carbon during its lifetime. In its report on the CCS technology, IPCC projects that more than 99% of carbon dioxide which is stored through geologic sequestration is likely to stay in place for more than 1000 years. While other types of carbon sinks such as the ocean, trees and soil may involve the risk of [[negative feedback loop]]s at increased temperatures, BECCS technology is likely to provide a better permanence by storing CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in geological formations.&lt;ref name="Global Status of BECCS Projects 2010"/&gt;&lt;ref name=IPCC5&gt;IPCC, (2005)[http://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/special-reports/srccs/srccs_chapter5.pdf  "Chapter 5: Underground geological storage" IPCC Special Report on Carbon dioxide Capture and Storage.] Prepared by Working Group III of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change [Metz, B., O. Davidson, H. C. De Coninck, M. Loos, and L. A. Meyer (eds.)]. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, United Kingdom and New York, NY, USA, pp195-276.&lt;/ref&gt;

The amount of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; that has been released  to date is believed to be too much to be able to be absorbed by conventional sinks such as trees and soil in order to reach low emission targets.&lt;ref name=hare&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s10584-005-9027-9 |title=How Much Warming are We Committed to and How Much can be Avoided? |year=2006 |last1=Hare |first1=Bill |last2=Meinshausen |first2=Malte |journal=Climatic Change |volume=75 |pages=111}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the presently accumulated emissions, there will be significant additional emissions during this century, even in the most ambitious low-emission scenarios. BECCS has therefore been suggested as a technology to reverse the emission trend and create a global system of net negative emissions.&lt;ref name=Obersteiner/&gt;&lt;ref name=IPCC2007/&gt;&lt;ref name=hare/&gt;&lt;ref name=Azar&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s10584-005-3484-7 |title=Carbon Capture and Storage from Fossil Fuels and Biomass – Costs and Potential Role in Stabilizing the Atmosphere |year=2006 |last1=Azar |first1=Christian |last2=Lindgren |first2=Kristian |last3=Larson |first3=Eric |last4=Möllersten |first4=Kenneth |journal=Climatic Change |volume=74 |pages=47}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.energy.2007.09.005 |title=System study of carbon dioxide (CO2) capture in bio-based motor fuel production |year=2008 |last1=Lindfeldt |first1=Erik G. |last2=Westermark |first2=Mats O. |journal=Energy |volume=33 |issue=2 |pages=352}}&lt;/ref&gt; This implies that the emissions would not only be zero, but negative, so that not only the emissions, but the absolute amount of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in the atmosphere would be reduced.

==Technology==
{{Main|Carbon capture and storage}}
The main technology for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; capture from biotic sources generally employs the same technology as carbon dioxide capture from conventional fossil fuel sources. Broadly, three different types of technologies exist: [[post combustion capture|post-combustion]], [[pre-combustion]], and [[Oxy-fuel combustion process|oxy-fuel combustion]].&lt;ref&gt;IPCC, (2005)[http://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/special-reports/srccs/srccs_chapter3.pdf "Chapter 3: Capture of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;" IPCC Special Report on Carbon dioxide Capture and Storage.] Prepared by Working Group III of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change [Metz, B., O. Davidson, H. C. De Coninck, M. Loos, and L. A. Meyer (eds.)]. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, United Kingdom and New York, NY, USA, pp 105-178.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cost==

The [[sustainability|sustainable]] technical potential for net negative emissions with BECCS has been estimated to 10 [[Gigatonne|Gt]] of {{CO2}} equivalent annually, with an economic potential of up to 3.5 Gt of {{CO2}} equivalent annually at a cost of less than 50 €/tonne, and up to 3.9 Gt of {{CO2}} equivalent annually at a cost of less than 100 €/tonne.&lt;ref name="IEA-GHG Ecofys BECCS report"&gt;{{citation

Currently, most schematic BECCS systems are not cost-efficient compared to normal CCS. The IPCC states that estimations for BECCS cost range from $60-$250 per ton of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-climatechange-ccs-idUSBREA2P1LK20140326|title=Extracting carbon from nature can aid climate but will be costly: U.N.|date=2017-03-26|work=Reuters|access-date=2017-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, "normal" CCS (from coal and natural gas processing) costs have been decreasing to less than $35 per ton.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.c2es.org/technology/factsheet/CCS|title=Carbon Capture Use and Storage {{!}} Center for Climate and Energy Solutions|website=www.c2es.org|language=en|access-date=2017-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; With limited large-scale testing, BECCS faces many challenges to be a financially viable alternative.

==Policy==

Based on the current [[Kyoto Protocol]] agreement, carbon capture and storage projects are not applicable as an emission reduction tool to be used for the [[Clean Development Mechanism]] (CDM) or for [[Joint Implementation]] (JI) projects.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/environment/climat/emission/index_en.htm Emission Trading Scheme (EU ETS) from ec.europa.eu]&lt;/ref&gt; Recognising CCS technologies as an emission reduction tool is vital for the implementation of such plants as there is no other financial motivation for the implementation of such systems. There has been growing support to have fossil CCS and BECCS included in the protocol. Accounting studies on how this can be implemented, including BECCS, have also been done.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s11027-006-9034-9 |title=Equal Opportunity for Biomass in Greenhouse Gas Accounting of CO2 Capture and Storage: A Step Towards More Cost-Effective Climate Change Mitigation Regimes |year=2006 |last1=Grönkvist |first1=Stefan |last2=Möllersten |first2=Kenneth |last3=Pingoud |first3=Kim |journal=Mitigation and Adaptation Strategies for Global Change |volume=11 |issue=5–6 |pages=1083}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Techno-economics of BECCS and the TESBiC Project==

The largest and most detailed techno-economic assessment of BECCS was carried out by cmcl innovations and the TESBiC&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cmclinnovations.com/TESBIC |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-01-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121106035708/http://www.cmclinnovations.com/TESBIC/ |archivedate=2012-11-06 |df= }}{{full citation needed|date=June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; group (Techno-Economic Study of Biomass to CCS) in 2012. This project recommended the most promising set of biomass fueled power generation technologies coupled with carbon capture and storage (CCS). The project outcomes lead to a detailed “biomass CCS roadmap” for the U.K..

== Environmental considerations==
{{See also|Issues relating to biofuels}}
Some of the environmental considerations and other concerns about the widespread implementation of BECCS are similar to those of CCS. However, much of the critique towards CCS is that it may strengthen the dependency on depletable fossil fuels and environmentally invasive coal mining. This is not the case with BECCS, as it relies on renewable biomass. There are however other considerations which involve BECCS and these concerns are related to the possible increased use of [[biofuels]].

Biomass production is subject to a range of sustainability constraints, such as: scarcity of arable land and fresh water, [[Biodiversity loss|loss of biodiversity]], competition with food production, [[deforestation]] and scarcity of phosphorus.&lt;ref&gt;Ignacy, S.: (2007) [http://www.unctad.org/en/docs/ditcted200712_en.pdf  "The Biofuels Controversy"], United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, 12&lt;/ref&gt; It is important to make sure that biomass is used in a way that maximizes both energy and climate benefits. There has been criticism to some suggested BECCS deployment scenarios, where there would be a very heavy reliance on increased biomass input.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Large areas of land would be required to operate BECCS on an industrial scale. To remove 10 billion tons of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, upwards of 300 million hectares of land area (larger than India) would be required.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; As a result, BECCS risks using land that could be better suited to agriculture and food production, especially in developing countries.

These systems may have other negative side effects. There is however presently no need to expand the use of biofuels in energy or industry applications to allow for BECCS deployment. There is already today considerable emissions from point sources of biomass derived CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, which could be utilized for BECCS. Though, in possible future bio-energy system upscaling scenarios, this may be an important consideration.

The BECCS process allows CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to be collected and stored directly from the atmosphere, rather than from a fossil source. This implies that any eventual emissions from storage may be recollected and restored simply by reiterating the BECCS-process. This is not possible with CCS alone, as CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emitted to the atmosphere cannot be restored by burning more fossil fuel with CCS.

== Current projects ==
Most CCS projects include adding capture to an existing power plant, usually coal or another fossil fuel.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.carbonbrief.org/analysis-negative-emissions-tested-worlds-first-major-beccs-facility|title=Analysis: Negative emissions tested at world's first major BECCS facility {{!}} Carbon Brief|date=2016-05-31|work=Carbon Brief|access-date=2017-05-05|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; With complete capture, these processes would be carbon neutral. Decatur, Illinois in the United States has many corn plants run by [[Archer Daniels Midland]] (ADM), where corn is processed into syrups and ethanol.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The plant emits high amounts of carbon dioxide as a byproduct of the process. With the CCS fitting, the plant ideally becomes carbon negative, since corn absorbs carbon dioxide when it grows, and all the carbon dioxide produced during processing is being captured and sequestered in the [[Mount Simon Sandstone|Mount Simon]] sandstone.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The project cannot be completely carbon negative, as carbon dioxide is produced during the combustion of the ethanol that is being produced. The project is one of the only CCS projects in use to not be coupled with [[Enhanced oil recovery|EOR]]. The Southern Illinois Basin is considered one of the best injection sites, due to its sandstone composition and depth (injection site is 2,000 meters below the surface),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://hub.globalccsinstitute.com/publications/global-status-beccs-projects-2010/5-decatur-illinois-united-states|title=5.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3915">In [[telecommunications]], the '''carrier-to-noise ratio''', often written '''CNR''' or '''''C/N''''', is the [[signal-to-noise ratio]] (SNR) of a [[modulation|modulated]] signal. The term is used to distinguish the CNR of the radio frequency [[passband]] signal from the SNR of an analog [[base band]] message signal after [[demodulation]], for example an audio frequency analog message signal. If this distinction is not necessary, the term SNR is often used instead of CNR, with the same definition.

Digitally modulated signals (e.g. [[QAM]] or [[Phase-shift keying|PSK]]) are basically made of two [[Continuous wave|CW]] carriers (the [[In-phase and quadrature components|I and Q]] components, which are out-of-phase carriers). In fact, the information (bits or symbols) is carried by given combinations of phase and/or amplitude of the I and Q components. It is for this reason that, in the context of digital modulations, digitally modulated signals are usually referred to as carriers. Therefore, the term carrier-to-noise-ratio (CNR), instead of signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) is preferred to express the signal quality when the signal has been digitally modulated.

High ''C/N'' ratios provide good quality of reception, for example low [[bit error rate]] (BER) of a digital message signal, or high SNR of an analog message signal.

==Definition==
The carrier-to-noise ratio is defined as the ratio of the received modulated carrier signal [[Power (physics)|power]] ''C'' to the received noise power ''N'' after the receiver filters:
:&lt;math&gt;
\mathrm{CNR} = \frac{C}{N}
&lt;/math&gt;.
When both carrier and noise are measured across the same [[Characteristic impedance|impedance]], this ratio can equivalently be given as:
:&lt;math&gt;
\mathrm{CNR} = \left( \frac{V_C}{V_N} \right) ^2
&lt;/math&gt;,
where &lt;math&gt;V_C&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;V_N&lt;/math&gt; are the [[root mean square]] (RMS) voltage levels of the carrier signal and noise respectively.
 
''C''/''N'' ratios are often specified in [[decibel]]s (dB):
:&lt;math&gt;
\mathrm{CNR_{dB}} = 10 \log_{10}\left( \frac {C}{N} \right) = C_{dBm} - N_{dBm}
&lt;/math&gt;
or in term of voltage:
:&lt;math&gt;
\mathrm{CNR_{dB}} = 10 \log_{10}\left( \frac{V_C}{V_N} \right)^2 = 20 \log_{10}\left( \frac {V_C}{V_N} \right)
&lt;/math&gt;

==CNR measurements and estimation==

The ''C/N'' ratio is measured in a manner similar to the way the [[signal-to-noise ratio]] (''S/N'') is measured, and both specifications give an indication of the quality of a communications channel.

In the famous [[Shannon–Hartley theorem]], the ''C/N'' ratio is equivalent to the ''S/N'' ratio. The ''C/N'' ratio resembles the [[carrier-to-interference ratio]] (''C/I'', '''CIR'''), and the [[carrier-to-noise-and-interference ratio]], ''C/(N+I)'' or '''CNIR'''.
 
''C/N'' estimators &lt;ref&gt;Islam2008&lt;/ref&gt; are needed to optimize the receiver performance. Typically, it is easier to measure  the total
power than the ratio of signal power to noise power (or noise power spectral density), and that is why CNR [[estimation]] techniques are timely and important.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4901">In [[theoretical computer science]], a '''certifying algorithm''' is an algorithm that outputs, together with a solution to the problem it solves, a proof that the solution is correct. A certifying algorithm is said to be ''efficient'' if the combined runtime of the algorithm and a proof checker is slower by at most a constant factor than the best known non-certifying algorithm for the same problem.&lt;ref name="mmns"&gt;{{citation

 | volume = 5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The proof produced by a certifying algorithm should be in some sense simpler than the algorithm itself, for otherwise any algorithm could be considered certifying (with its output verified by running the same algorithm again). Sometimes this is formalized by requiring that a verification of the proof take less time than the original algorithm, while for other problems (in particular those for which the solution can be found in [[linear time]]) simplicity of the output proof is considered in a less formal sense.&lt;ref name="mmns"/&gt; For instance, the validity of the output proof may be more apparent to human users than the correctness of the algorithm, or a checker for the proof may be more amenable to [[formal verification]].&lt;ref name="mmns"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

Implementations of certifying algorithms that also include a checker for the proof generated by the algorithm may be considered to be more reliable than non-certifying algorithms. For, whenever the algorithm is run, one of three things happens: it produces a correct output (the desired case), it detects a bug in the algorithm or its implication (undesired, but generally preferable to continuing without detecting the bug), or both the algorithm and the checker are faulty in a way that masks the bug and prevents it from being detected (undesired, but unlikely as it depends on the existence of two independent bugs).&lt;ref name="mmns"/&gt;

==Examples==
Many examples of problems with checkable algorithms come from [[graph theory]].
For instance, a classical algorithm for testing whether a graph is [[bipartite graph|bipartite]] would simply output a Boolean value: true if the graph is bipartite, false otherwise. In contrast, a certifying algorithm might output a 2-coloring of the graph in the case that it is bipartite, or a cycle of odd length if it is not. Any graph is bipartite if and only if it can be 2-colored, and non-bipartite if and only if it contains an odd cycle. Both checking whether a 2-coloring is valid and checking whether a given odd-length sequence of vertices is a cycle may be performed more simply than testing bipartiteness.&lt;ref name="mmns"/&gt;

Analogously, it is possible to test whether a given directed graph is [[directed acyclic graph|acyclic]] by a certifying algorithm that outputs either a [[topological sorting|topological order]] or a directed cycle. It is possible to test whether an undirected graph is a [[chordal graph]] by a certifying algorithm that outputs either an elimination ordering (an ordering of all vertices such that, for every vertex, the neighbors that are later in the ordering form a [[Clique (graph theory)|clique]]) or a chordless cycle. And it is possible to test whether a graph is [[planar graph|planar]] by a certifying algorithm that outputs either a planar embedding or a [[Kuratowski's theorem|Kuratowski subgraph]].&lt;ref name="mmns"/&gt;

The [[extended Euclidean algorithm]] for the [[greatest common divisor]] of two integers {{mvar|x}} and {{mvar|y}} is certifying: it outputs three integers {{mvar|g}} (the divisor), {{mvar|a}}, and {{mvar|b}}, such that {{math|''ax'' + ''by'' {{=}} ''g''}}. This equation can only be true of multiples of the greatest common divisor, so testing that {{mvar|g}} is the greatest common divisor may be performed by checking that {{mvar|g}} divides both {{mvar|x}} and {{mvar|y}} and that this equation is correct.&lt;ref name="mmns"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2093">A '''chess diagram''' is graphic representation and stylized of a specific moment in a [[chess]] game, showing the different positions occupied by chess pieces in given time during game development.

This graphical representation is done through symbols previously agreed for this purpose in order to facilitate reading the diagram.

The chess diagrams are a resource widely used not only in teaching game in the courses offered to people just getting into it; but they are also used in subsequent analysis, that amateurs and professionals players at this discipline can make of games played, especially in championship games.

Similarly they are used in the development of [[chess problem]]s that are all these diagrams with composed positions and whose solution is to checkmate in a given number of moves and are often published in newspapers and magazines.

Icons or symbols used represent the basic characteristics of chessmen, such as in the case of rook is used picture of a defensive tower made with bricks and with 3 battlements and 2 gunboats at top of its.

It is worth mentioning that at present most diagrams represent the [[Bishop (chess)|bishop]] using a miter with two lappets by way of feet; but there are some variants of diagrams where this piece is represented by a helmet with visor.

A '''deployment diagram''' in the [[Unified Modeling Language]] models the ''physical'' deployment of [[Artifact (UML)|artifacts]] on [[Node (UML)|nodes]].&lt;ref&gt;Deployment diagrams show "the allocation of [[Artifact (UML)|Artifacts]] to [[Node (UML)|Nodes]] according to the Deployments defined between them." [http://www.omg.org/spec/UML/2.1.2/Superstructure/PDF/ Unified Modeling Language, Superstructure, V2.1.2] p. 202.&lt;/ref&gt;  To describe a [[web site]], for example, a deployment diagram would show what hardware components ("nodes") exist (e.g., a [[web server]], an [[application server]], and a [[database server]]), what software components ("artifacts") run on each node (e.g., [[web application]], [[database]]), and how the different pieces are connected (e.g. [[JDBC]], [[REST]], [[Remote Method Invocation|RMI]]).

The nodes appear as boxes, and the artifacts allocated to each node appear as rectangles within the boxes.  Nodes may have subnodes, which appear as nested boxes.  A single node in a deployment diagram may conceptually represent multiple physical nodes, such as a cluster of database servers.

There are two types of Nodes:
# Device Node
# Execution Environment Node

Device nodes are physical computing resources with processing memory and services to execute software, such as typical computers or mobile phones. An execution environment node (EEN) is a software computing resource that runs within an outer node and which itself provides a service to host and execute other executable software elements.

{{History of the Jews in England}}
The '''Edict of Expulsion''' was a royal decree issued by King [[Edward I of England]] on 18 July 1290, expelling all [[Jew]]s from the [[Kingdom of England]]. The expulsion edict remained in force for the rest of the [[Middle Ages]]. The edict was not an isolated incident, but the culmination of over 200 years of increased persecution. The edict was overturned during [[the Protectorate]] more than 350 years later, when [[Oliver Cromwell]] [[Resettlement of the Jews in England|permitted Jews to return to England]] in 1657. King Edward I advised Sheriffs of all Counties he wanted all Jews expelled by no later than [[All Saints' Day|All Saints' Day (1st November)]] of the year the decree was issued.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/judaism/history/350.shtml Ireland’s Readmission of Jews to Britain 1656, BBC]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The first Jewish communities of significant size came to England with [[William the Conqueror]] in 1066.&lt;ref&gt;[[Paul Johnson (writer)|Paul Johnson]], ''A History of the Jews'', p. 208&lt;/ref&gt; After the conquest of England, William instituted a [[feudal system]] in the country, whereby all estates formally belonged to [[The Crown#Origins|the Crown]]; the king then appointed lords over these vast estates, but they were subject to duties and obligations (financial and military) to the king. Under the lords were other subjects such as [[serfs]], who were bound and obliged to their lords, and to their lords' obligations. Merchants had a special status in the system, as did Jews. Jews were declared to be direct subjects of the king,&lt;ref name="Glassman_1975_14"&gt;{{harvnb|Glassman|1975|p=14}}.&lt;/ref&gt; unlike the rest of the population. This was an ambivalent legal position for the Jewish population, in that they were not tied to any particular lord but were subject to the whims of the king, it could be either advantageous or disadvantageous. Every successive king formally reviewed a [[royal charter]], granting Jews the right to remain in England. Jews did not enjoy any of the guarantees of the [[Magna Carta]]&lt;ref name="Rubenstein_1996_36"&gt;{{harvnb|Rubenstein|1996|p=36}}.&lt;/ref&gt; of 1215.

Economically, Jews played a key role in the country. The Church then strictly forbade the [[usury|lending of money for profit]], creating a vacuum in the economy of Europe that Jews filled because of extreme discrimination in every other economic area. [[Canon law]] was not considered applicable to Jews, and [[loans and interest in Judaism|Judaism does not forbid loans with interest between Jews and non-Jews]].&lt;ref name="Parkes_1976_303"&gt;{{harvnb|Parkes|1976|p=303}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Taking advantage of their unique status as his direct subjects, the King could appropriate Jewish assets in the form of taxation. He levied heavy taxes on Jews at will, without having to summon [[Parliament of England|Parliament]].&lt;ref name="Rubenstein_1996_37"&gt;{{harvnb|Rubenstein|1996|p=37}}.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The reputation of Jews as extortionate money-lenders arose,{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}} which made them extremely unpopular with both the Church and the general public. While an anti-Jewish attitude was wide-spread in Europe, medieval England was particularly anti-Jewish.&lt;ref name="Rubenstein_1996_36"/&gt; An image of the Jew as a diabolical figure who hated Christ started to become wide-spread, and myths such as the tale of the [[Wandering Jew]] and [[Blood libel|allegations of ritual murders]] originated and spread throughout England as well as in Scotland and Wales.&lt;ref name="Glassman_1975_17"&gt;{{harvnb|Glassman|1975|p=17}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In frequent cases of [[blood libel]], Jews were said to hunt for children to murder before [[Passover]] so that they could use their blood to make the unleavened [[matzah]].&lt;ref name="Rubenstein_1996_39"&gt;{{harvnb|Rubenstein|1996|p=39}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Anti-Jewish attitudes sparked numerous riots in which many Jews were murdered, most notably in 1190, when [[History of the Jews in England#Persecution and expulsion|over 100 Jews were massacred in York]].&lt;ref name="Rubenstein_1996_39"/&gt;

==Expulsion==
[[File:Expulsion judios-en.svg|thumb|right|400px|Expulsions of Jews in Europe from 1100 to 1600]]
The situation only got worse for Jews as the 13th century progressed. In 1218, [[Henry III of England|Henry III]] of England proclaimed the Edict of the Badge requiring Jews to wear a [[Yellow badge|marking badge]].&lt;ref name="Glassman_1975_16"&gt;{{harvnb|Glassman|1975|p=16}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Taxation grew increasingly intense. Between 1219–1272, 49 levies were imposed on Jews for a total of 200,000 [[Mark (currency)#England and Scotland|mark]]s, a vast sum of money.&lt;ref name="Rubenstein_1996_37"/&gt; Henry III imposed greater segregation and reinforced the wearing of badges in the 1253 [[Statute of Jewry]]. He endorsed the myth of Jewish child murders. Meanwhile, his court and major Barons bought Jewish debts with the intention of securing lands of lesser nobles through defaults. The [[Second Barons' War]] in the 1260s brought a series of pogroms aimed at destroying the evidence of these debts and Jewish communities in major towns, including London, where 500 Jews died, [[Worcester]], [[Canterbury]] and many other towns.&lt;ref name=Jacobs&gt;{{harvnb|Jacobs|1903}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first major step towards expulsion took place in 1275, with the [[Statute of the Jewry]]. The statute outlawed all lending at interest and gave Jews fifteen years to readjust.&lt;ref name="Prestwich_1997_345"&gt;{{harvnb|Prestwich|1997|p=345}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Gascony|duchy of Gascony]] in 1287, King Edward ordered the local Jews expelled.&lt;ref name="Prestwich_1997_306"&gt;{{harvnb|Prestwich|1997|p=306}}.&lt;/ref&gt; All their property was seized by the crown and all outstanding debts payable to Jews were transferred to the King’s name.&lt;ref name="Prestwich_1997_346"&gt;{{harvnb|Prestwich|1997|p=346}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the time he returned to England in 1289, King Edward was deeply in debt.&lt;ref name="Prestwich_1997_307"&gt;{{harvnb|Prestwich|1997|p=307}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next summer he summoned his knights to impose a steep tax. To make the tax more palatable, Edward, in exchange, essentially offered to expel all Jews.&lt;ref name="Prestwich_1997_343"&gt;{{harvnb|Prestwich|1997|p=343}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  The heavy tax was passed, and three days later, on 18 July,&lt;ref&gt;On the [[Hebrew calendar]], this date was 9 Av ([[Tisha B'Av]]) 5050.&lt;/ref&gt; the Edict of Expulsion was issued.

One official reason for the expulsion was that Jews had declined to follow the Statute of Jewry and continued to practice usury. This is quite likely, as it would have been extremely hard for many Jews to take up the "respectable" occupations demanded by the Statute. The edict of expulsion was widely popular and met with little resistance, and the expulsion was quickly carried out.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

The Jewish population in England at the time was relatively small, perhaps 2,000 people, although estimates vary.&lt;ref&gt;Mundill, Robin R. (2002) ''England's Jewish Solution: Experiment and Expulsion, 1262–1290'', pg. 27. Cambridge University Press; {{ISBN|0-521-52026-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The expulsion process appears to have been relatively non-violent, although there were some accounts to the contrary. One perhaps apocryphal story told of a captain taking a ship full of Jews to the [[Thames]], en route to France, while the tide was low, and convincing them to go out for a walk with him. He then lost them and made it back to his ship quickly before the tide came back in, leaving them all to drown.&lt;ref name="Prestwich_1997_346"/&gt;

Many Jews emigrated, to Scotland, France and the Netherlands, and as far as [[History of the Jews in Poland|Poland]], which, at that time, protected them (see [[Statute of Kalisz]]).

==Intermediate period==
Between the expulsion of Jews in 1290 and their [[Resettlement of the Jews in England|formal return]] in 1655, there are records of Jews in the [[Domus Conversorum]] up to 1551 and even later. An attempt was made to obtain a revocation of the edict of expulsion as early as 1310, but in vain. Notwithstanding, a certain number of Jews appeared to have returned; for complaints were made to the king in 1376 that some of those trading as [[Lombard banking|Lombards]] were actually Jews.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Rolls of Parliament|Rotuli Parliamentorum]]'' ii. 332a.&lt;/ref&gt;

Occasionally permits were given to individuals to visit England, as in the case of Dr Elias Sabot (an eminent physician from [[Bologna]] summoned to attend [[Henry IV of England|Henry IV]]) in 1410, but it was not until the expulsion of the Jews from Spain in 1492 and Portugal in 1497 that any considerable number of [[Sephardic Jew]]s found refuge in England. In 1542 many were arrested on the suspicion of being Jews, and throughout the sixteenth century a number of persons named Lopez, possibly all of the same family, took refuge in England, the best known of them being [[Rodrigo López (physician)|Rodrigo López]], physician to [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth I]], and who is said by some commentators to have been the inspiration for [[Shylock]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Greenblatt|first=S.|year=2004|title=Will In The World: How Shakespeare Became Shakespeare|location=New York|publisher=W.W. Norton|isbn=0-393-05057-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

England also saw converts like [[Immanuel Tremellius]] and [[Philip Ferdinand]]. Jewish visitors included [[Joachim Gaunse]], who introduced new methods of mining into England and there are records of visits from Jews called Alonzo de Herrera and Simon Palache in 1614. The writings of [[John Weemes]] in the 1630s provided a positive view of the resettlement of Jews in England, effected in 1657.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bowman|first=John|date=1949-01-01|year=|title=A Seventeenth Century Bill of "Rights" for Jews|jstor=1453260|journal=The Jewish Quarterly Review|volume=39|issue=4|pages=379–389|doi=10.2307/1453260}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Energy therapy}}
'''Energy medicine''', '''energy therapy''', '''energy healing''', '''psychic healing''', '''spiritual medicine''' or '''spiritual healing''' are branches of [[alternative medicine]] based on a [[pseudoscience|pseudo-scientific]] belief that healers can channel healing [[Energy (esotericism)|energy]] into a patient and effect positive results. This idea itself contains several methods:  hands-on,&lt;ref name=Times/&gt; hands-off,&lt;ref name=Times/&gt; and distant&lt;ref name=Times/&gt;&lt;ref name=brockhampton&gt;{{cite book |title= Guide to Spiritual Healing |last= Daulby |first= Martin |first2= Caroline |last2=Mathison |year= 1996 |publisher= Brockhampton Press |isbn= 1-86019-370-6 |page=89 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (or absent) where the patient and healer are in different locations.

Many schools of energy healing exist using many names, for example, ''biofield energy healing'',&lt;ref name="mdanderson"&gt;{{cite web | year=2007 | url=http://www.mdanderson.org/publications/network/issues/2007-fall/network-fall-2007-energy-medicines-will-east-meet-west-.html | title=Energy Medicines: Will East Meet West? | author1=Network newsletter | author2=MD Anderson Cancer Center | access-date=November 30, 2010 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101125021822/http://www.mdanderson.org/publications/network/issues/2007-fall/network-fall-2007-energy-medicines-will-east-meet-west-.html | archive-date=November 25, 2010 | dead-url=yes | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="springerlink"&gt;{{cite web |date=October 2007  | url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/n772q20j61180nj0/ | title=Biofield Therapies: Helpful or Full of Hype? | work=International Journal of Behavioral Medicine (Volume 17, Number 1, 1–16) | doi=10.1007/s12529-009-9062-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''spiritual healing'',&lt;ref name="Ernst 2001 88–92"&gt;{{cite journal | title=A primer of complementary and alternative medicine commonly used by cancer patients |authorlink=Edzard Ernst | journal=Medical Journal of Australia | first=Edzard | last=Ernst | year=2001 | volume=174|issue=2 | pages=88–92|pmid=11245510 |url=http://www.mja.com.au/public/issues/174_02_150101/ernst/ernst.html#suba10}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''contact healing'', ''distant healing'', ''Qi Do'', ''[[therapeutic touch]]'',&lt;ref name="Therapeutic Touch"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cancer.org/Treatment/TreatmentsandSideEffects/ComplementaryandAlternativeMedicine/ManualHealingandPhysicalTouch/therapeutic-touch |title=Therapeutic Touch |publisher=Cancer.org |date=June 2, 2008 |accessdate=2010-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Reiki]]''&lt;ref name="Reiki Practice"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nccih.nih.gov/health/reiki/ |title=Reiki Practice |publisher=Nccih.nih.gov |accessdate=2010-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; or ''[[Qigong]].''&lt;ref name="mdanderson"/&gt;

''Spiritual healing'' occurs largely in [[non-denominational]] and [[ecumenical]] contexts.  Practitioners do not see traditional religious [[faith]] as a prerequisite for effecting cures.&lt;ref name="What is healing"&gt;[http://www.thehealingtrust.org.uk/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=46&amp;Itemid=94 What is healing?] ''The Healing Trust'' at thehealingtrust.org.uk, Accessed March 4, 2017&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Faith healing]],'' by contrast, takes place within a traditional religious context.&lt;ref&gt;[https://sciencebasedmedicine.org/faith-healing/ Harriet Hall, 26 January 2010: faith-healing (see in particular, section: '''The Evidence for Faith Healing''': "...

Even at Lourdes, the Catholic Church has only recognized 4 cures since 1978, out of 5 million people who seek healing there every year. There simply is no evidence that faith healing heals. Not what science considers evidence. And the true believers don’t value evidence or the scientific method: for them, belief is enough.") at sciencebasedmedicine.org] Accessed March 4, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

While early reviews of the scientific literature on energy healing were equivocal and recommended further research,&lt;ref name=Astin/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ernst 2001 88–92"/&gt; more recent reviews have concluded that there is no evidence supporting clinical efficiency.&lt;ref name=Abbot/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

==Classification==

The term "energy medicine" has been in general use since the founding of the non-profit ''International Society for the Study of Subtle Energies and Energy Medicine'' in the 1980s. Guides are available for practitioners, and other books aim to provide a theoretical basis and evidence for the practice. Energy medicine often proposes that imbalances in the body's "energy field" result in illness, and that by re-balancing the body's energy-field health can be restored.&lt;ref name="NCCAM"/&gt; Some modalities describe treatments as ridding the body of negative energies or blockages in 'mind'; illness or episodes of ill health after a treatment are referred to as a 'release' or letting go of a 'contraction' in the body-mind. Usually, a practitioner will then recommend further treatments for complete healing.

The US-based ''[[National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health]]'' (NCCIH) distinguishes between health care involving scientifically observable energy, which it calls "Veritable Energy Medicine", and health care methods that invoke physically undetectable or unverifiable [[energy (esotericism)|"energies"]], which it calls "Putative Energy Medicine":&lt;ref name=NCCAM&gt;{{cite web | year=2005 | url=http://nccih.nih.gov/health/backgrounds/energymed.htm | title=Energy Medicine: An Overview | author=National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Types of "veritable energy medicine" include [[magnet therapy]], [[colorpuncture]], and [[light therapy]]. Medical techniques involving the use electromagnetic radiation (''e.g.'' [[radiation therapy]] or [[magnetic resonance imaging]]) are not considered "energy medicine" in the terms of alternative medicine.
* Types of "putative energy medicine" include biofield energy healing therapies where the hands are claimed to direct or modulate "energies" which are believed to effect healing in the patient;&lt;ref "name=warber"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Warber, S.

Polarity therapy founded by [[Randolph Stone]] is a kind of energy medicine&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wellnessinstitute.net/web/polarity_therapy|title=Polarity Therapy|publisher=Wellness Institute|accessdate=October 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; based on the belief that a person's health is subject to positive and negative charges in their electromagnetic field.&lt;ref name=acs&gt;{{cite book |publisher=[[American Cancer Society]] |title=American Cancer Society Complete Guide to Complementary and Alternative Cancer Therapies |edition=2nd |year=2009 |isbn=9780944235713 |editors=Russell J, Rovere A |pages=235–237 |chapter=Polarity Therapy}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been promoted as capable of curing a number of human ailments ranging from muscular tightness to cancer; however, according to the [[American Cancer Society]] "available scientific evidence does not support claims that polarity therapy is effective in treating cancer or any other disease".&lt;ref name=acs/&gt;

==Beliefs==
[[File:Reiki-Treatment.jpg|thumb|A Reiki practitioner]]
Energy healing relies on a belief in the ability of a practitioner to channel healing energy into the person seeking help by different methods: hands-on,&lt;ref name=Times/&gt; hands-off,&lt;ref name=Times/&gt; and distant&lt;ref name=Times/&gt;&lt;ref name="brockhampton"/&gt; (or absent) where the patient and healer are in different locations. The ''Brockhampton Guide to Spiritual Healing'' describes contact healing in terms of "transfer of ... healing energy" and distant healing based on visualising the patient in perfect health.&lt;ref name="brockhampton"/&gt; Practitioners say that this "healing energy" is sometimes perceived by the therapist as a feeling of heat.&lt;ref name=Times&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/health/alternative_medicine/article4317985.ece|author=Jules Evans | title=Spiritual healing on the NHS? | publisher=The Times|date=July 14, 2008 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are various schools of energy healing, including ''biofield energy healing'',&lt;ref name="mdanderson"/&gt;&lt;ref name="springerlink"/&gt; ''spiritual healing'',&lt;ref name="Ernst 2001 88–92"/&gt; ''contact healing'', ''distant healing'', ''[[therapeutic touch]]'',&lt;ref name="Therapeutic Touch"/&gt; ''[[Reiki]],''&lt;ref name="Reiki Practice"/&gt; ''[[Qigong]],'' and many others.&lt;ref name="mdanderson"/&gt;

''Spiritual healing'' is largely non-denominational; traditional religious faith is not seen as a prerequisite for effecting a cure. ''[[Faith healing]],'' by contrast, takes place within a religious context.&lt;ref name="What is healing"/&gt; The Buddha is often quoted by practitioners of energy medicine, but he did not practise "hands on or off" healing.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}

Energy healing techniques such as [[Therapeutic touch]] have found recognition in the nursing profession. In 2005–2006, the ''[[North American Nursing Diagnosis Association]]'' approved the diagnosis of "[[energy field disturbance]]" in patients, reflective of what has been variously called a "[[postmodernism|postmodern]]" or "anti-scientific" approach to nursing care. This approach has been strongly criticised.&lt;ref name=Glazer&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.nationalaffairs.com/public_interest/detail/postmodern-nursing|year=2000|title=Postmodern nursing | author=Sarah Glazer | work=National Affairs}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Hammer&gt;{{cite journal | last = Hammer | first = Owen | authorlink = |author2=James Underdown  | title = State-Sponsored Quackery: Feng Shui and Snake Oil for California Nurses  | journal = [[Skeptical Inquirer]]  | volume = 33  | issue = 6  | pages = 53–56 | publisher = Committee for Skeptical Inquiry | url = http://www.csicop.org/si/show/state-sponsored_quackery_feng_shui_and_snake_oil_for_california_nurses/ | date = November–December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Junk&gt;[http://junkfoodscience.blogspot.com/2007/07/junkfood-science-special-trusting.html Junkfood Science Special: Trusting nurses with our lives] by Sandy Szwarc, BSN, RN, CCP.

Believers in these techniques have proposed [[Quantum mysticism|quantum mystical]] invocations of [[Quantum nonlocality|non-locality]] to try to explain distant healing.&lt;ref name=AAQM&gt;{{cite web | title=Some Notes on the American Academy of Quantum Medicine (AAQM) | author=Stephen Barrett | url=http://www.quackwatch.com/04ConsumerEducation/Nonrecorg/aaqm.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; They have also proposed that healers act as a channel passing on a kind of [[bioelectromagnetism]] which shares similarities to [[vitalism|vitalistic]] [[pseudosciences]] such as [[orgone]] or [[qi]].&lt;ref name="stenger"&gt;{{cite journal | author=[[Victor J.

Writing in the ''Journal of Bodywork and Movement Therapies'', James Oschman&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Oschman | first1=James L. | doi=10.1016/S1360-8592(97)80038-1 | title=What is healing energy?

Oschman believes that "healing energy" derives from [[frequency|electromagnetic frequencies]] generated by a medical device, projected from the hands of the healer, or by [[electron]]s acting as [[antioxidant]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Oschman|first1=James|title=Can Electrons Act as Antioxidants?

Physicists and sceptics roundly criticise these explanations as [[pseudophysics]]&amp;nbsp;– a branch of [[pseudoscience]] which explains [[magical thinking]] by using irrelevant jargon from modern physics to exploit [[scientific literacy|scientific illiteracy]] and to impress the unsophisticated.&lt;ref name=GistLubin&gt;{{cite book|title=Response to disaster: psychosocial, community, and ecological approaches in clinical and community psychology|publisher=Psychology Press|year=1999|isbn=0-87630-998-8|page=291|author1=Richard Gist |author2=Bernard Lubin }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scientific investigations==

===Distant healing===

A systematic review of 23 trials of distant healing published in 2000 did not draw definitive conclusions because of the "methodologic limitations of several studies".&lt;ref name=Astin&gt;{{Cite journal|title=The Efficacy of "Distant Healing: A Systematic Review of Randomized Trials|journal=Annals of Internal Medicine|year=2000|last=Astin|first=J.|author2=et. al|volume=132|issue=11|pages=903–910 | url=http://www.annals.org/content/132/11/903.abstract|pmid=10836918|doi=10.7326/0003-4819-132-11-200006060-00009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001 the lead author of that study, [[Edzard Ernst]], published a primer on complementary therapies in cancer care in which he explained that though "about half of these trials suggested that healing is effective" he cautioned that the evidence was "highly conflicting" and that "methodological shortcomings prevented firm conclusions." He concluded that "as long as it is not used as an alternative to effective therapies, spiritual healing should be virtually devoid of risks."&lt;ref name="Ernst 2001 88–92" /&gt;  A 2001 randomised clinical trial by the same group found no statistically significant difference on chronic pain between distance healers and "simulated healers".&lt;ref name=Abbot&gt;{{Cite journal | doi=10.1016/S0304-3959(00)00421-8 | last1=Abbot | title=Spiritual healing as a therapy for chronic pain: a randomized, clinical trial | first1=NC | last2=Harkness | first2=EF | last3=Stevinson | first3=C | last4=Marshall | first4=FP | last5=Conn | first5=DA | last6=Ernst | first6=E. |authorlink6=Edzard Ernst | author9=Abbot, NC, Harkness, EF, Stevinson, C, Marshall, FP, Conn, DA and Ernst, E. | journal=Pain | volume=91 | issue=1–2 | year=2001 | pages=79–89|pmid=11240080}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2003 review by Ernst updating previous work concluded that more recent research had shifted the weight of evidence "against the notion that distant healing is more than a placebo" and that "distant healing can be associated with adverse effects."&lt;ref name=Ernst2003&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1007/BF03040322 | author=Ernst E. |authorlink=Edzard Ernst | title=Distant healing—an update of a systematic review | journal=Wien Klin Wochenschr. | year=2003 | volume=115 | issue=7–8 | pages=241–245 | url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/h852m82147632728/ | pmid=12778776}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Contact healing===
A 2001 randomised clinical trial randomly assigned 120 patients with chronic pain to either healers or "simulated healers", but could not demonstrate efficacy for either distance or face-to-face healing.&lt;ref name="Abbot"/&gt; A systematic review in 2008 concluded that the evidence for a specific effect of spiritual healing on relieving neuropathic or neuralgic pain was not convincing.&lt;ref name=Pittler&gt;{{Cite journal | doi=10.1097/AJP.0b013e3181759231 | last1=Pittler | first1=MH | last2=Ernst | first2=E. |authorlink2=Edzard Ernst | author9=Pittler, MH.; Ernst, E. | title=Complementary Therapies for Neuropathic and Neuralgic Pain: Systematic Review | journal=Clinical Journal of Pain. | volume=24 | issue=8 | pages=731–733 | year=2008 | pmid=18806539}}&lt;/ref&gt; In their 2008 book ''[[Trick or Treatment]]'', [[Simon Singh]] and [[Edzard Ernst]] concluded that "spiritual healing is biologically implausible and its effects rely on a placebo response. At best it may offer comfort; at worst it can result in charlatans taking money from patients with serious conditions who require urgent conventional medicine."&lt;ref name=TrickOrTreatment&gt;{{Cite book| title=[[Trick or Treatment]] | year=2008 | publisher= W.

===Evidence base===

Alternative medicine researcher Edzard Ernst has argued that although an initial review of pre-1999 distant healing trials&lt;ref name=Astin/&gt; had highlighted 57% of trials as showing positive results,&lt;ref name="Ernst 2001 88–92"/&gt; later reviews of non-randomised and randomised clinical trials conducted between 2000 and 2002&lt;ref name=Ernst2003/&gt; led to the conclusion that "the majority of the rigorous trials do not support the hypothesis that distant healing has specific therapeutic effects". Ernst described the evidence base for healing practices to be "increasingly negative".&lt;ref name=ernst2006&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.jpainsymman.2006.07.010 |title=Spiritual healing: more than meets the eye |author=Ernst E. |authorlink=Edzard Ernst |journal=J Pain Symptom Manage. |date=November 2006 |volume=32 |issue=5 |pages=393–5 |pmid=17085260 | url=http://www.jpsmjournal.com/article/S0885-3924(06)00524-0/fulltext}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ernst also warned that many of the reviews were under suspicion for fabricated data, lack of transparency, and scientific misconduct. He concluded that "[s]piritual healing continues to be promoted despite the absence of biological plausibility or convincing clinical evidence ... that these methods work therapeutically and plenty to demonstrate that they do not."&lt;ref name=ernst2006/&gt; A 2014 study of energy healing for colorectal cancer patients showed no improvement in quality of life, depressive symptoms, mood, or sleep quality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=CG Pedersen |author2=H Johannessen |author3=JV Hjelmborg |author4=R Zachariae |title=Effectiveness of energy healing on Quality of Life: a pragmatic intervention trial in colorectal cancer patients|journal=Complementary Therapies in Medicine|date=June 2014|volume=22|issue=3|pages=463–72|pmid=24906586|doi=10.1016/j.ctim.2014.04.003}}&lt;!--|accessdate=August 5, 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alternative explanations for positive reports==
There are several, primarily psychological, explanations for positive reports after energy therapy, including [[placebo effect]]s, [[spontaneous remission]], and [[cognitive dissonance]]. A 2009 review found that the "small successes" reported for two therapies collectively marketed as "energy psychology" ([[Emotional Freedom Techniques]] and [[Tapas Acupressure Technique]]) "are potentially attributable to well-known cognitive and behavioral techniques that are included with the energy manipulation." The report concluded that "[p]sychologists and researchers should be wary of using such techniques, and make efforts to inform the public about the ill effects of therapies that advertise miraculous claims."&lt;ref name=McCaslin&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Psychotherapy (Chicago) |date=June 2009 |volume=46 |issue=2 |pages=249–56 |title=A review of efficacy claims in energy psychology |author=McCaslin DL |pmid=22122622 |doi=10.1037/a0016025}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are primarily two explanations for anecdotes of cures or improvements, relieving any need to appeal to the supernatural.&lt;ref name='USDMoores1'&gt;{{Cite news| title=Complementary and Alternative Therapies for Cancer Patients: Faith Healing | publisher=Moores UCSD Cancer Center | url =http://cancer.ucsd.edu/Outreach/PublicEducation/CAMs/faith.asp | work = | pages = | accessdate = 2008-01-17 | language = }} "Benefits may result because of the natural progression of the illness, rarely but regularly occurring spontaneous remission or through the placebo effect."&lt;/ref&gt; The first is ''[[post hoc ergo propter hoc]]'', meaning that a genuine improvement or [[spontaneous remission]] may have been experienced coincidental with but independent from anything the healer or patient did or said. These patients would have improved just as well even had they done nothing. The second is the [[placebo]] effect, through which a person may experience genuine pain relief and other symptomatic alleviation. In this case, the patient genuinely has been helped by the healer{{spaced ndash}} not through any mysterious or numinous function, but by the power of their own belief that they would be healed.&lt;ref name="Park"&gt;{{Cite book| last = Park | first = Robert L. | authorlink = Robert L.

Both cases, are strictly limited to the body's natural abilities.

Positive findings from research studies can also result from such psychological mechanisms, or as a result of [[experimenter bias]], methodological flaws such as lack of [[Blind experiment|blinding]],&lt;ref name=McCaslin/&gt; or [[publication bias]]; positive reviews of the scientific literature may show [[selection bias]], in that they omit key studies that do not agree with the author's position.&lt;ref name=McCaslin/&gt;&lt;ref name=Pignotti&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Pignotti, M.  |author2=Thyer, B. | year=2009 | title=Some comments on "Energy psychology: A review of the evidence": Premature conclusions based on incomplete evidence? | journal=Psychotherapy: Research, Practice, Training | volume=46 | pages=257–261 | doi = 10.1037/a0016027 | issue = 2 | pmid=22122623}}&lt;/ref&gt; All of these factors must be considered when evaluating claims.

==Bioresonance therapy==
'''Bioresonance therapy''' (including '''MORA therapy''') is a [[pseudoscientific]] medical practice in which it is proposed that [[electromagnetic wave]]s can be used to diagnose and treat human illness.&lt;ref name="Ernst 2004 171-173"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Ernst E. |authorlink=Edzard Ernst |title=Bioresonance, a study of pseudo-scientific language |journal=Forsch Komplementärmed Klass Naturheilkd |volume=11 |issue=3 |pages=171–173 |date=June 2004  |pmid=15249751 |doi=10.1159/000079446}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===History and method===
Bioresonance therapy was invented in (Germany) in 1977 by Franz Morell and his son-in-law, engineer Erich Rasche. Initially they marketed it as "MORA-Therapie", for MOrell and RAsche. Some of the machines contain an electronic circuit measuring skin-resistance, akin to the [[E-meter]] used by [[Scientology]], which the bioresonance creators sought to improve; Franz Morell had links with Scientology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=FAQ|url=http://www.bioenergeticmedicine.org/CoRe-System/Main/FAQ.htm|website=www.bioenergeticmedicine.org|accessdate=November 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{unreliable source?|date=February 2014}}{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Practitioners claim to be able to detect a variety of diseases and addictions. Some practitioners also claim they can treat diseases using this therapy without drugs, by stimulating a change of "bioresonance" in the cells, and reversing the change caused by the disease. The devices would need to be able to isolate and pinpoint pathogens' responses from the mixture of responses the device receives via the electrodes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Efficacy Study into Bioresonance Therapy|url=https://bioresonance.com/efficacy-study-into-bioresonance-therapy-slides/|publisher=Bioresonance.com|accessdate=November 27, 2016|date=November 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Transmitting these transformed signals over the same electrodes is claimed by practitioners to generate healing signals that have the curative effect.&lt;ref name=qw /&gt;

===Effectiveness===
One placebo-controlled study of the effects of bioresonance therapy showed that "MORA bioresonance therapy can markedly improve non-organic gastro-intestinal complaints."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Nienhaus J, Galle M |title=[Placebo-controlled study of the effects of a standardized MORA bioresonance therapy on functional gastrointestinal complaints] |language=German |journal=Forsch Komplementärmed |volume=13 |issue=1 |pages=28–34 |year=2006 |doi=10.1159/000090134 |pmid=16582548}}&lt;/ref&gt; This research study, however, was conducted with a relatively small sample size of 20 people and published by a journal that exclusively publishes "alternative medicine" procedures. The bioresonance diagnosis was complemented by the practitioner's dietary suggestions, making for an uncontrolled experiment with no analytical methods. The only measuring methods present were the subjective analysis of the practitioner pre and post diagnosis.

===Scientific criticism===
Lacking any scientific explanation of how bioresonance therapy might work, researchers have classified bioresonance therapy as [[pseudoscience]].&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal |author=Galle M |title=[Bioresonance, a study of pseudo-scientific language] |language=German |journal=Forsch Komplementärmed Klass Naturheilkd |volume=11 |issue=5 |pages=306; author reply 306 |date=October 2004 |doi=10.1159/000082152 |pmid=15580708 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;
Some [[Science|scientific]] studies did not show effects above that of the [[placebo effect]].&lt;ref name=Wuth16047707&gt;{{cite journal |author=Wüthrich B |title=Unproven techniques in allergy diagnosis |journal=J Investig Allergol Clin Immunol |volume=15 |issue=2 |pages=86–90 |year=2005 |pmid=16047707 |url=http://www.centropediatrico.ch/Data/w%C3%BCthrich%20unproven%20techniques%20in%20allergy.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130512182250/http://www.centropediatrico.ch/Data/w%C3%BCthrich%20unproven%20techniques%20in%20allergy.pdf |archivedate=May 12, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1159/000237460 |vauthors=Schöni MH, Nikolaizik WH, Schöni-Affolter F |title=Efficacy trial of bioresonance in children with atopic dermatitis |journal= Int Arch Allergy Immunol |volume=112 |issue=3 |pages =238–46 |date=March 1997 |pmid=9066509 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Proven cases of online fraud have occurred,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.consumeraffairs.com/news02/biores.html "BioResonance" Promoter Settles Charges]&lt;/ref&gt; with a practitioner making false claims that he had the ability to cure cancer, and that his clients did not need to follow the chemotherapy or surgery recommended by medical doctors, which can be life-saving.  [[Ben Goldacre]] ridiculed the [[BBC]] when it reported as fact a clinic's claim that the treatment had the ability to stop 70% of clients smoking, a better result than any conventional therapy.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/science/2005/nov/12/badscience.uknews Who's holding a smoking gun to bioresonance?]

{{Evolutionary biology}}

[[Evolution (term)|Evolutionary]] ideas during the periods of the [[Renaissance]] and [[Age of Enlightenment | the Enlightenment]] developed over a time when [[natural history]] became more sophisticated during the 17th and 18th centuries, and as the [[scientific revolution]] and the rise of  [[mechanical philosophy]] encouraged viewing the natural world as a machine with workings capable of analysis. But the evolutionary ideas of the early 18th century were of a religious and spiritural nature. In the second half of the 18th century more materialistic and explicit ideas about biological [[evolution]] began to emerge, adding further strands in the [[history of evolutionary thought]].

==17th and early 18th century==
The word ''evolution'' (from the [[Latin]] ''evolutio'', meaning "to unroll like a scroll") appeared in English in the 17th century, referring to an orderly sequence of events, particularly one in which the outcome was somehow contained within it from the start. Notably, in 1677 Sir [[Matthew Hale (jurist)|Matthew Hale]], attacking the [[atheist]]ic [[atomism]] of [[Democritus]] and [[Epicurus]], used the term ''evolution'' to describe his opponent's ideas that vibrations and collisions of atoms in the void &amp;mdash; without divine intervention &amp;mdash; had formed "Primordial Seeds" (semina) which were the "immediate, primitive, productive Principles of Men, Animals, Birds and Fishes."&lt;ref name="Goodrum2002"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Goodrum|first=Matthew R.|title=Atomism, Atheism, and the Spontaneous Generation of Human Beings: The Debate over a Natural Origin of the First Humans in Seventeenth-Century Britain|journal=Journal of the History of Ideas|volume=63| issue =  2|pages=207–224|date=April 2002|doi=10.1353/jhi.2002.0011}}&lt;/ref&gt; For Hale, this mechanism was "absurd", because "it must have potentially at least the whole Systeme of Humane Nature, or at least that Ideal Principle or Configuration thereof, in the '''evolution''' whereof the complement and formation of the Humane Nature must consist ... and all this drawn from a fortuitous coalition of senseless and dead Atoms."&lt;ref name="Goodrum2002" /&gt;

While Hale (ironically) first used the term evolution in arguing ''against'' the exact mechanistic view the word would come to symbolize, he also demonstrates that at least some [[evolutionism|evolutionist]] theories explored between 1650 and 1800 postulated that the universe, including life on earth, had developed mechanically, entirely without divine guidance. Around this time, the [[mechanical philosophy]] of [[Descartes]], reinforced by the [[physics]] of [[Galileo]] and [[Isaac Newton|Newton]], began to encourage the machine-like view of the universe which would come to characterise the [[scientific revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;Bowler 2003 pp. 33-38&lt;/ref&gt; However, most contemporary theories of evolution, including those developed by the German idealist philosophers [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph von Schelling|Schelling]] and [[Hegel]] (and mocked by [[Schopenhauer]]), held that evolution was a fundamentally ''spiritual'' process, with the entire course of natural and human evolution being "a self-disclosing revelation of the Absolute".&lt;ref&gt;Schelling, ''System of Transcendental Idealism'', 1800&lt;/ref&gt;

Typical of these theorists, [[Gottfried Leibniz]] postulated in 1714 that "[[Monad (philosophy)|monad]]s" inside objects caused motion by internal forces, and maintained that "the 'germs' of all things have always existed ... [and] contain within themselves an internal principle of development which drives them on through a vast series of metamorphoses" to become the geological formations, lifeforms, psychologies, and civilizations of the present. Leibniz clearly felt that evolution proceeded on divine principles &amp;mdash; in his ''De rerum originatione radicali'' (1697), he wrote: "A cumulative increase of the beauty and universal perfection of the works of God, a perpetual and unrestricted progress of the universe as a whole must be recognized, such that it advances to a higher state of cultivation."&lt;ref&gt;Lovejoy 1936, p. 257&lt;/ref&gt; Others, such as [[J. G. von Herder]], expressed similar ideas.&lt;ref&gt;Lovejoy 1936, pp. 183–184, 279–280, 369&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1603 and 1613 [[Sir Walter Raleigh]] was a prisoner in the [[Tower of London]] awaiting execution; in this period he wrote a history of the world in five volumes where he described his American experiences and adventures, in it he wondered whether all the new species discovered in the new continent could have found their place on [[Noah's Ark]]. A very serious question at the time, he postulates that only animals from the old continent found place on the Ark; eventually, after the Flood, some of these animals would migrate to the new continent and, under environmental pressure, change their appearances to create new species.&lt;ref&gt;Wendt Herbert, ''In Search of Adam'', 1955, pp. 38-39&lt;/ref&gt; Fifty years later, Matthew Hale went even further, and said that only the prototypes of all animal species were welcomed on the Ark; these would eventually differentiate after their release.&lt;ref&gt;Wendt Herbert, ''In Search of Adam'', 1955, pp. 40&lt;/ref&gt; Many clergymen were happy with Raleigh and Hale ideas since they appeared to solve the problem of the Ark's tonnage.

==Mid 18th century==
In his ''Venus Physique'' in 1745, and ''System of Nature'' in 1751, [[Pierre Louis Maupertuis]] veered toward more materialist ground. He wrote of natural modifications occurring during reproduction and accumulating over the course of many generations, producing races and even new species. He also anticipated in general terms the idea of [[natural selection]].&lt;ref&gt;Bowler 2003 pp. 73–75&lt;/ref&gt;

Vague and general ideas of evolution continued to proliferate among the mid-eighteenth century [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] philosophers. [[G. L. L. Buffon]] suggested that what most people referred to as species were really just well-marked varieties. He thought that the members of what was then called a genus (which in terms of modern [[scientific classification]] would be considered a family) are all descended from a single, common ancestor. The ancestor of each family had arisen through [[spontaneous generation]]; environmental effects then caused them to diverge into different species. He speculated that the 200 or so species of mammals then known might have descended from as few as 38 original forms. Buffon's concept of evolution was strictly limited. He believed there were "internal molds" that shaped the spontaneous generation of each family and that the families themselves were entirely and eternally distinct. Thus, lions, tigers, leopards, pumas and house cats could all share a common ancestor, but dogs and house cats could not.&lt;ref&gt;Bowler 2003 pp. 75–80&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Larson 2004 pp. 14–15&lt;/ref&gt;  Although Darwin's foreword to his 6th edition of ''Origin'' credited [[Aristotle]] with foreshadowing the concept of [[natural selection]], he also wrote that "the first author who in modern times has treated it in a scientific spirit was Buffon".&lt;ref&gt;Darwin 1872 p.9&lt;/ref&gt;

Some 18th-century writers speculated about human evolution. [[John Mitchell (geographer)|John Mitchell]], a [[physician]] and [[cartographer]], wrote a book in 1744 called ''An Essay upon the Causes of the Different Colours of People in Different Climates'' in which he claimed that the first [[race (classification of humans)|race]] on earth had been a brown and reddish colour he said "that an intermediate tawny colour found amongst Asiatics and Native Amerindians" had been the “original complexion of mankind” and that others races came about by the original race spending generations in different climates.&lt;ref&gt;Colin Kidd, The forging of races: race and scripture in the Protestant Atlantic world, 1600 - 2000, 2006, p. 30&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1767 and 1792 [[James Burnett, Lord Monboddo]] included in his writings not only the concept that man had descended from other primates, but also that, in response to their environment, creatures had found methods of transforming their characteristics over long time intervals. He also produced research on the evolution of [[linguistics]], which was cited by Erasmus Darwin in his poem ''Temple of Nature''.&lt;ref&gt;Darwin, Erasmus 1825 p.9&lt;/ref&gt; Jan-Andrew Henderson states that Monboddo was the first to articulate the theory of [[natural selection]].&lt;ref&gt;Henderson 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1792, the philosopher [[Immanuel Kant]] presented, in his ''[[Critique of Judgement]]'', what he referred to as “a daring venture of reason”, in which “one organic being [is] derived from another organic being, although from one which is specifically different; e.g., certain water-animals transform themselves gradually into marsh-animals and from these, after some generations, into land-animals.”&lt;ref&gt;Kant 1792 Section 80&lt;/ref&gt; Some 20th-century philosophers, such as [[Eric Voegelin]], credit Kant with foreshadowing modern evolutionary theory.&lt;ref&gt;Eric Voegelin, CW VOL 3,Chapter 14, The Unfolding of the World of Organic Forms pp 142-144.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In 1796, [[Erasmus Darwin]] published his ''[[Zoönomia]]'', which suggested "that all warm-blooded animals have arisen from one living filament ... with the power of acquiring new parts"&lt;ref&gt;Darwin, Erasmus 1818 Vol I section XXXIX&lt;/ref&gt; in response to stimuli, with each round of improvements being inherited by successive generations. In his 1802 poem ''Temple of Nature'', he described the rise of life from minute organisms living in the mud to its modern diversity:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
First forms minute, unseen by spheric glass,&lt;br&gt;
Move on the mud, or pierce the watery mass;&lt;br&gt;
These, as successive generations bloom,&lt;br&gt;
New powers acquire and larger limbs assume;&lt;br&gt;
Whence countless groups of vegetation spring,&lt;br&gt;
And breathing realms of fin and feet and wing.&lt;ref&gt;Darwin, Erasmus 1825 p. 15&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Many of the expellees were citizens of the United Kingdom and Colonies and 27,200 subsequently emigrated to the [[United Kingdom]]. Of the other refugees who were accounted for, 6,000 went to [[Canada]], 4,500 refugees ended up in [[India]] and 2,500 went to nearby [[Kenya]].&lt;ref name="Jørgensen1981" /&gt; In total, some 5,655 firms, ranches, farms, and agricultural estates were reallocated, along with cars, homes and other household goods.&lt;ref name="Jørgensen1981" /&gt;

== Background ==
The presence of South Asians in Uganda was the result of deliberate choices by the British administration (1894–1962).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{harvnb|Henckaerts|Sohn|1995|pp=22&amp;ndash;24}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were brought to the [[Uganda Protectorate]] by the British to "serve as a buffer between Europeans and Africans in the middle rungs of commerce and administration".&lt;ref name="Jørgensen1981" /&gt; In addition, in the 1890s, 32,000 labourers from British India were [[Indian diaspora in Southeast Africa|brought to Southeast Africa]] under indentured labour contracts to work on the construction of the [[Uganda Railway]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Jørgensen|1981|p=43}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the surviving Indians returned home, but 6,724 individuals decided to remain in the [[African Great Lakes]] after the line's completion.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}} At the time of the expulsion, there were approximately 80,000 individuals of South Asian descent in Uganda, of whom 23,000 had had their applications for citizenship both processed and accepted.&lt;ref name="Amin-Indophobia"&gt;{{harvnb|Patel|1972|pp=12&amp;ndash;19}}&lt;/ref&gt; A further 50,000 were British passport holders,&lt;ref name="BBC On This Day" /&gt; though Amin himself used the apparently exaggerated figure of 80,000 British passport holders in his initial expulsion speech.&lt;ref name="Amin-Indophobia" /&gt;

The British had invested in the education of the Asian minority, in preference to that of indigenous Ugandans.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; By the early 1970s, many Indians in Southeast Africa and Uganda were employed in the [[sartorial]] and [[banking]] businesses{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}} and [[Indophobia]] was already engrained by the start of Amin's rule in February 1971.&lt;ref name="Amin-Indophobia" /&gt; While not all Ugandan Asians were well off, they were on average better off than the indigenous communities,&lt;ref name="Amin-Indophobia" /&gt; constituting 1% of the population while receiving a fifth of the national income.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}} Indians were stereotyped as "merely traders" and labelled as "dukawallas" (an occupational term that degenerated into an anti-Indian slur during Amin's time{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}), who tried to cheat unsuspecting purchasers and looked out only for their own families.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Harvnb|Patel|1972|pp=19&amp;ndash;21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, it was "not unusual to find that Indians possessed attitudes of superiority and negative pictures of the ability and efficiency of Africans".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Racial segregation was institutionalised.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Gated ethnic communities served elite healthcare and schooling services. Additionally, the tariff system in Uganda had historically been oriented toward the economic interests of South Asian traders.&lt;ref name="Journal of Modern African Studies"&gt;{{harvnb|Jamal|1976}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Milton Obote]]'s government had pursued a policy of "Africanisation" which included policies targeted at Ugandan Asians. The 1968 Committee on the "Africanisation in Commerce and Industry", for example, had made far-reaching Indophobic proposals and a system of work permits and trade licenses was introduced in 1969 to restrict the role of non-citizen Indians in economic and professional activities. Nevertheless, Amin's policies represented a significant acceleration.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In August 1971, Amin announced a review of the citizenship status awarded to Uganda's Asian community, followed by the declaration of a [[census]] of Uganda's Asian population in October that year.&lt;ref name="Jørgensen1981" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Amin-Indophobia" /&gt; In order to resolve the "misunderstandings" regarding the role of Uganda's Asian minority in society, he then convened an Indian 'conference' for 7–8 December. In a memorandum presented on the second day of the conference, he set out his hope that "the wide gap" between Ugandan Asians and Africans would narrow.&lt;ref name="Amin-Indophobia" /&gt; While paying tribute to Indians' contribution to the economy and the professions, he accused a minority of the Asian population of disloyalty, non-integration and commercial malpractice, claims Indian leaders disputed.&lt;ref name="Amin-Indophobia" /&gt; On the vexed question of citizenship, he said his government would recognise citizenship rights already granted, but all outstanding applications for citizenship (which by this point were thought to number more than 12,000) would be cancelled.&lt;ref name="Amin-Indophobia" /&gt;

This expulsion of an ethnic minority was not the first in Uganda's history as the country's [[Kenya]]n minority, numbering approximately 30,000, had been expelled in 1969–70.&lt;ref name="Jørgensen1981" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mutibwa|1992|p=67}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The expulsion==
[[File:Idi Amin -Archives New Zealand AAWV 23583, KIRK1, 5(B), R23930288.jpg|thumb|upright|Idi Amin, pictured shortly after the expulsion]]

On 4 August 1972, Amin declared that Britain would need to take on responsibility for British subjects of Asian origin,&lt;ref name="Jørgensen1981" /&gt; accusing them of "sabotaging Uganda's economy and encouraging corruption".&lt;ref name="Amin-Indophobia" /&gt; The deadline for British subjects to leave was confirmed as three months, which came to mean 8 November. On 9 August, the policy was expanded to include citizens of India, Pakistan and Bangladesh.&lt;ref name="Jørgensen1981" /&gt; The position of the 23,000 Asians who had been granted Ugandan citizenship (and in particular those who held no other citizenship) was less clear. Not originally included, on 19 August, they were seemingly added to the list, before being re-exempted three days later following international protest. Many chose to leave rather than endure further intimidation, with only 4,000 known to have stayed.&lt;ref name="Jørgensen1981" /&gt; Exemptions for certain professions were added, then later removed.&lt;ref name="Jørgensen1981" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Amin-Indophobia" /&gt;

The precise motivation for the expulsion remains unclear. Some of his former supporters suggest that it followed a dream in which, he claimed, Allah had told him to expel them, as well as plot vengeance against the British government for refusing to provide him with arms to invade Tanzania.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2007-04-15/india/27882308_1_devang-raval-museveni-indians | work=The Times Of India | title=Idi Amin had targeted Indians in 70s | date=15 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amin defended the expulsion by arguing that he was giving Uganda back to the ethnic Ugandans:

{{quote|We are determined to make the ordinary Ugandan master of his own destiny, and above all to see that he enjoys the wealth of his country. Our deliberate policy is to transfer the economic control of Uganda into the hands of Ugandans, for the first time in our country's history.|Idi Amin|quoted in ''Uganda: a modern history''.&lt;ref name="Jørgensen1981"/&gt;}}

Ugandan soldiers during this period engaged in theft and physical and sexual violence against the Asians with impunity.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}} Restrictions were imposed on the sale or transfer of private businesses by Ugandan Asians and on 16 August Amin made it clear that after he was done with Indian-owned business, European-owned businesses would be next.&lt;ref name="Amin-Indophobia" /&gt;

== Impact ==
Amin's decrees drew immediate condemnation, including from India, who severed diplomatic relations with Uganda. The Indian government warned Uganda of dire consequences, but took no action when Amin's government ignored the ultimatum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.paralumun.com/waridiamin.htm|title=Idia Amin Biography|accessdate=29 October 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927025444/http://www.paralumun.com/waridiamin.htm|archivedate=27 September 2011|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The United Kingdom froze a £10 million loan which had been arranged the previous year; Amin simply shrugged this off.&lt;ref name="Amin-Indophobia" /&gt;

Many of the Indians were citizens of the United Kingdom and Colonies and 27,200 refugees subsequently emigrated to the [[United Kingdom]]. Of the other refugees who were accounted for, 6,000 went to [[Canada]], 4,500 ended up in [[India]] and 2,500 went to nearby [[Kenya]]. [[Malawi]], [[Pakistan]], [[West Germany]] and the [[United States]] took 1,000 refugees each, with smaller numbers emigrating to [[Australia]], [[Austria]], [[Sweden]], [[Norway]], [[Mauritius]] and [[New Zealand]]. About 20,000 refugees were unaccounted for.&lt;ref name="Jørgensen1981" /&gt;&lt;ref name="socialorigins"&gt;{{harvnb|Kasozi |Musisi|Sejjengo|1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only a few hundred remained behind.&lt;ref name="Amin-Indophobia" /&gt; Reluctant to expand its newly introduced immigration quota, the British government had sought agreement from its British overseas territories to resettle them; however, only the [[Falkland Islands]] responded positively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2003/jan/01/past.politics | title=Ministers hunted for island to house Asians | first=Alan | last=Travis | work=The Guardian | date=1 January 2003 | accessdate=22 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kenya]] and [[Tanzania]] similarly closed their borders with Uganda to prevent an influx of refugees.&lt;ref name="Amin-Indophobia" /&gt;

Some of those expelled were [[Nizari Ismaili]] [[Muslims]]. The [[Aga Khan]], the Imam of Nizari Ismailis phoned his long-time friend Canadian Prime Minister [[Pierre Trudeau]]. Trudeau's government agreed to allow thousands of Nizari Ismailis to emigrate to Canada.&lt;ref name="macleansHolyMan"&gt;{{harvnb|Geddes|2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The exodus of Ugandan Asians took on a new level of urgency on the September following a telegram from Amin to the UN Secretary General [[Kurt Waldheim]], in which it appeared that Amin was sympathetic to Hitler's treatment of Jews and an airlift was organised.&lt;ref name="Amin-Indophobia" /&gt; The UN dispatched the Executive Secretary of the [[United Nations Economic Commission for Africa|Economic Commission for Africa]], [[Robert K. A. Gardiner]], who attempted in vain to convince Amin to reverse his decision.{{sfn|Sherwood|2014|p=43}}

Before the expulsion, Asians owned many large businesses in Uganda but the purge of Asians from Uganda's economy was virtually total. In total, some 5,655 firms, ranches, farms, and agricultural estates were reallocated, along with cars, homes and other household goods.&lt;ref name="Jørgensen1981"/&gt; For political reasons, most (5,443) were reallocated to individuals, with 176 going to government bodies, 33 being reallocated to semi-state organisations and 2 going to charities. Possibly the biggest winner was the state-owned [[Uganda Development Corporation]], which gained control over some of the largest enterprises, though both the rapid nature of the growth and the sudden lack of experienced technicians and managers proved a challenge for the corporation, resulting in a restructuring of the sector in 1974–5.&lt;ref name="Jørgensen1981"/&gt; "The Ugandan economy fell deep into a crisis under the strain of civil wars, the nationalization of certain industries and the expulsion of the Asians... By 1987, President Yoweri Museveni had inherited an economy that suffered the poorest growth rate in Africa."&lt;ref&gt;Samani, Vishva. Interview in the International Business Times, August 6, 2012. http://www.ibtimes.com/uganda-forty-years-after-idi-amin-expelled-asians-739228&lt;/ref&gt;

==Return==
Thousands of Gujaratis returned to Uganda after [[Yoweri Museveni]], the subsequent head of state of Uganda, criticized Idi Amin's policies and invited them to return.&lt;ref name=toi/&gt; According to Museveni, "Gujaratis have played a lead role in Uganda's social and industrial development. I knew that this community can do wonders for my country and they have been doing it for last many decades." The Gujaratis have resurfaced in Uganda and helped rebuild the economy of East Africa, and are financially well settled.&lt;ref name=toi/&gt;&lt;ref name="SinghRajan2015"&gt;{{cite book|author1=A.

Freeman was instrumental in creating the Citizens' Commission on Civil Rights founded in 1982. She was a practicing attorney in State and Federal courts for nearly sixty years.

In 2007, Freeman was inducted in the [[International Civil Rights Walk of Fame]] at the [[Martin Luther King Jr. National Historic Site]], [[Atlanta, Georgia]], for her leadership role in the [[Civil Rights Movement]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gainformer.com/Files/13%20Footsteps%20Civil%20Rights%20Walk.htm|title=International Civil Rights Walk of Fame|website=Gainformer.com|accessdate=13 January 2018}}{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
{{one source|section|date=January 2018}}
The daughter of William Brown Muse and Maude Beatrice Smith Muse, Frankie came from a college-educated family. She was born and grew up in [[Danville, Virginia]], where she attended Westmoreland School and learned to play the piano. At age sixteen, Muse enrolled in her mother's alma mater, [[Hampton University|Hampton Institute]], which she attended between 1933 and 1936. In 1944, she was admitted to [[Howard University|Howard University Law School]] and received a law degree in 1947.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=African American National Biography|last=DeBardelaben|first=LaNesha NeGale|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2008|isbn=|editor-last=Gates Jr.|editor-first=Henry|location=New York|pages=Online|chapter="Frankie Freeman Muse"}}&lt;/ref&gt; While a student at Howard Law, Freeman became a member of Epsilon Sigma Iota sorority, the first American legal sorority for women of color.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

In 1948, after writing to several law firms and not hearing back from them, Muse decided to establish her own private practice. She began her practice with pro bono, divorce and criminal cases. After two years, Freeman began her work in civil rights when she became legal counsel to the [[NAACP]] legal team that filed suit against the St. Louis Board of Education in 1949. In 1954, Freeman was the lead attorney for the landmark NAACP case ''[[Davis et al. v. The St. Louis Housing Authority|Davis et al. v. the St. Louis Housing Authority]]'', which ended legal racial discrimination in public housing with the city. Settling in St. Louis, Freeman worked as staff attorney for the St. Louis Land Clearance and Housing Authorities from 1956–70, first as associate general counsel and later as general counsel of the St. Louis Housing Authority.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/metro/at-citizen-of-year-frankie-freeman-continues-to-serve/article_21b643d8-450f-5892-873f-08b80aa04e3c.html|title=At 95, Citizen of Year Frankie Freeman continues to serve|last=Holland|first=Elizabethe|date=15 Jan 2012|website=St. Louis Post-Dispatch|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171228115208/http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/metro/at-citizen-of-year-frankie-freeman-continues-to-serve/article_21b643d8-450f-5892-873f-08b80aa04e3c.html|archive-date=28 December 2017|dead-url=|access-date=30 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 1964, she was nominated by [[Lyndon Johnson|President Lyndon Johnson]] as a member of the [[United States Commission on Civil Rights]]. On September 15, 1964, the Senate approved Freeman's nomination and she was officially appointed as the first black woman on the civil rights commission. Freeman was subsequently reappointed by presidents [[Richard Nixon]], [[Gerald Ford]] and [[Jimmy Carter]], and held the position until July 1979.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

She was appointed as Inspector General for the Community Services Administration during [[Jimmy Carter]]'s presidential administration in 1979. A year later, the Republican [[Ronald Reagan]] was elected president and demanded the resignation of Democratic inspectors general appointed by previous presidents.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

Freeman returned to St. Louis, where she practiced law. In 1982, Freeman joined 15 other former high federal officials who formed a bipartisan Citizens Commission on Civil Rights, a group committed to ending racial discrimination and devising remedies that would counteract its harmful effects.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cccr.org/about/commissioner.cfm?cid=22 Citizens' Commission on Civil Rights] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080209114922/http://www.cccr.org/about/commissioner.cfm?cid=22 |date=2008-02-09 }}, Cccr.org; accessed January 13, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

At age 90, she was still practicing law with Montgomery Hollie &amp; Associates, L.L.C. in St. Louis, a three-attorney firm. She had numerous volunteer activities, such as adult Sunday school classes at Washington Tabernacle Missionary Baptist Church. She was on the board of the [[World Affairs Councils of America]], St. Louis, with the mission to promote understanding, engagement, relationships, and leadership in world affairs.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

In 2003, she published her memoir, ''A Song of Faith and Hope''. She was the 14th National President of [[Delta Sigma Theta]] Sorority,  Incorporated. She [[centenarian|turned 100]] in November 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/education/notes-from-campus/st-louis-civil-rights-leader-receives-honorary-degree-from-mizzou/article_c033148a-3607-5fe1-82df-be70de621a90.html|title=St. Louis civil rights leader receives honorary degree from Mizzou|publisher=[[St. Louis Post-Dispatch]]|author=Ashley Jost|date=2016-12-17|accessdate=2017-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7932">'''Functional analysis''' in [[behavioral psychology]] is the application of the laws of [[operant conditioning|operant]] and [[respondent conditioning]] to establish the relationships between [[stimulus (psychology)|stimuli and responses]]. To establish the function of operant behavior, one typically examines the "four-term contingency": first by identifying the [[motivating operation]]s (EO or AO), then identifying the antecedent or trigger of the behavior, identifying the behavior itself as it has been [[operationalize]]d, and identifying the consequence of the behavior which continues to maintain it.

Functional assessment in [[behavior analysis]] employs principles derived from the natural science of behavior analysis to determine the "reason", purpose, or motivation for a behavior.  The most robust form of functional assessment is functional analysis, which involves the direct manipulation, using some experimental design (e.g., a multielement design or a reversal design) of various antecedent and consequent events and measurement of their effects on the behavior of interest; this is the only method of functional assessment that allows for demonstration of clear cause of behavior. {{citation needed|date=November 2013}}

==Applications in clinical psychology==
Functional analysis and consequence analysis are commonly used in certain types of psychotherapy to better understand, and in some cases change, behavior. It is particularly common in [[behavioral therapy|behavioral therapies]] such as [[behavioral activation]],&lt;ref&gt;Kanter, J.W.; Cautilli, J.D.; Busch, A.M. &amp; Baruch, D.E. (2005). Toward a Comprehensive Functional Analysis of Depressive Behavior: Five Environmental Factors and a Possible Sixth and Seventh. ''The Behavior Analyst Today'', 6(1), 65–81.[http://www.baojournal.com BAO]&lt;/ref&gt; although it is also part of Aaron Beck's [[cognitive therapy]]. In addition, functional analysis modified into a behavior chain analysis is often used in [[dialectical behavior therapy]].&lt;ref&gt;Sampl, S.; Wakai, S.; Trestman, R. &amp; Keeney, E.M. (2008). Functional Analysis of Behavior in Corrections: Empowering Inmates in Skills Training Groups.

There are several advantages to using functional analysis over traditional assessment methods. Firstly, behavioral observation is more reliable than traditional self-report methods. This is because observing the individual from an objective stand point in their regular environment allows the observer to observe both the antecedent and the consequence of the problem behavior. Secondly, functional analysis is advantageous as it allows for the development of behavioral interventions, either antecedent control or consequence control, specifically designed to reduce a problem behavior. Thirdly, functional analysis is advantageous for interventions for young children or developmentally delayed children with problem behaviors, who may not be able to answer self-report questions about the reasons for their actions.

Despite these benefits, functional analysis also has some disadvantages. The first that no standard methods for determining function have been determined&lt;ref&gt;Angela Waguespack, Terrence Vaccaro &amp; Lauren Continere (2006).

''IJBCT'', 4(2), 463–74 [http://www.baojournal.com BAO].&lt;/ref&gt; and meta-analysis shows that different methodologies appear to bias results toward particular functions as well as not effective in improving outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;Delfs, C.H. &amp; Campbell, J.M. (2010). A quantitative synthesis of developmental disability research: The impact of functional assessment methodology on treatment effectiveness. ''The Behavior Analyst Today'', 11(1), 4–19 [http://www.baojournal.com BAO].&lt;/ref&gt; Second, Gresham and colleagues (2004) in a meta-analytic review of JABA articles found that functional assessment did not produce greater effect sizes compared to simple [[contingency management]] programs.&lt;ref&gt;Gresham, F.; McIntyre, L.L.; Olson-Tinker, H.; Dolstra, L.; McLaughlin, V. &amp; Van, M.

''Journal of Behavior Analysis of Offender and Victim: Treatment and Prevention'', 1(2) 210–3 [http://www.baojournal.com BAO].&lt;/ref&gt;) much of the current functional assessment research has been limited to children with developmental disabilities.&lt;ref&gt;Gadaire, D.M.; Kelley, M.E. &amp; DeRosa, N.M.

==Professional organizations==
The [[Association for Behavioral and Cognitive Therapies]] (ABCT) also has an interest group in [[behavior analysis]], which focuses on the use of behavior analysis in the school setting including functional analysis.

Doctoral level behavior analysts who are psychologists belong to the [[American Psychological Association]]'s division 25&amp;nbsp;– [[Behavior analysis]]. APA offers a diplomate in behavioral psychology and school psychology both of which focus on the use of functional analysis in the school setting.

The World Association for Behavior Analysis offers a certification for clinical behavior therapy and behavioral consultation, which covers functional analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baojournal.com/WCBA/WCBA.html|title=World Center for Behavior Analysis|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110210160227/http://www.baojournal.com/WCBA/WCBA.html|archivedate=February 10, 2011 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The UK Society for Behaviour Analysis also provides a forum for behavior analysts for accreditation, professional development, continuing education and networking, and serves as an advocate body in public debate on issues relating to behavior analysis. The UK-SBA promotes the ethical and effective application of the principles of behavior and learning to a wide range of areas including education, rehabilitation and health care, business and the community and is committed to maintaining the availability of high-quality evidence-based professional behavior analysis practice in the UK. The society also promotes and supports the academic field of behavior analysis with in the UK both in terms of university-based training and research, and theoretical develop.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uk-sba.org/|title=UK Society for Behaviour Analysis}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="155769">A '''fuzzy concept''' is a [[concept]] of which the boundaries of application can vary considerably according to context or conditions, instead of being fixed once and for all.&lt;ref&gt;[[Susan Haack]], ''Deviant logic, fuzzy logic: beyond the formalism''. Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; This means the concept is [[Vagueness|vague]] in some way, lacking a fixed, precise meaning, without however being unclear or meaningless altogether.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Dietz &amp; Sebastiano Moruzzi (eds.), ''Cuts and clouds. Vagueness, Its Nature, and Its Logic.'' Oxford University Press, 2009; Delia Graff &amp; Timothy Williamson (eds.), ''Vagueness''. London: Routledge, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; It has a definite meaning, which can be made more precise only through further elaboration and specification - including a closer definition of the context in which the concept is used. The study of the characteristics of fuzzy concepts and fuzzy language is called ''fuzzy semantics''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Timothy Williamson]], ''Vagueness''. London: Routledge, 1994, p. 124f; [[Lotfi A. Zadeh]], "Quantitative fuzzy semantics". ''Information Sciences'', Vol. 3, No. 2, April 1971, pp. 159-176.&lt;/ref&gt; The inverse of a "fuzzy concept" is a "crisp concept" (i.e. a precise concept). 

A fuzzy concept is understood by scientists as a concept which is "to an extent applicable" in a situation. That means the concept has ''gradations'' of significance or ''unsharp'' (variable) boundaries of application. A fuzzy statement is a statement which is true "to some extent", and that extent can often be represented by a scaled value. The best known example of a fuzzy concept around the world is an amber [[traffic light]], and indeed fuzzy concepts are widely used in traffic control systems.&lt;ref&gt;Sandeep Mehan &amp; Vandana Sharma, "Development of traffic light control system based on fuzzy logic".  ''ACAI '11 Proceedings of the International Conference on Advances in Computing and Artificial Intelligence 2011'', pp. 162–165.&lt;/ref&gt; The term is also used these days in a more general, popular sense - in contrast to its technical meaning - to refer to a concept which is "rather vague" for any kind of reason.

In the past, the very idea of reasoning with fuzzy concepts faced considerable resistance from academic elites. They did not want to endorse the use of imprecise concepts in research or argumentation. Yet although people might not be aware of it, the use of fuzzy concepts has risen gigantically in all walks of life from the 1970s onward. That is mainly due to advances in electronic engineering, fuzzy mathematics and digital computer programming. The new technology allows very complex inferences about "variations on a theme" to be anticipated and fixed in a program.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bart Kosko]], ''Fuzzy Thinking: The New Science of Fuzzy Logic.'' New York: Hyperion, 1993; [[Bart Kosko]], ''Heaven in a chip: fuzzy visions of society and science in the digital age''. New York: Three Rivers Press, 1999; Daniel McNeill &amp; Paul Freiberger, ''Fuzzy Logic: The Revolutionary Computer Technology that Is Changing Our World.'' New York: Simon &amp; Schuster, 1994.

Klir]], ''Fuzzy Logic and Mathematics: A Historical Perspective''. Oxford University Press, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The new [[neuro-fuzzy]] computational methods make it possible, to identify, to measure and respond to fine gradations of significance, with great precision.&lt;ref&gt;A useful overview is provided in: Enrique Ruspini et al. ''Handbook of fuzzy computation''. Bristol &amp; Philadelphia: Institute of Physics Publishing, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; It means that practically useful concepts can be coded and applied to all kinds of tasks, even if, ordinarily, these concepts are never precisely defined. Nowadays engineers, statisticians and programmers often represent fuzzy concepts mathematically, using fuzzy logic, fuzzy values, fuzzy variables and fuzzy sets.&lt;ref&gt;Radim Behlohlavek &amp; George J. Klir (eds.), ''Concepts and fuzzy logic''. Cambridge, Mass.: MIT Press, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
Problems of vagueness and fuzziness have probably always existed in human experience.&lt;ref&gt;Rudolf Seising et al., ''On fuzziness: homage to Lotfi A. Zadeh'', Vol. 2. Heidelberg: Springer, 2013, p. 656; Ellen Christiaanse, "1.5 million years of information systems; from hunters-gatherers to the domestication of the networked computer". In: David Avison et al., ''The past and future of information systems: 1976-2006 and beyond''. New York: IFIP/Springer, 2006, pp. 165-176.&lt;/ref&gt; The boundary between different things can appear blurry. Sometimes people have to think, when they are not in the best frame of mind to do it, or, they have to talk about something out there, which just isn't sharply defined. Across time, however, philosophers and scientists began to reflect about those kinds of problems, in much more systematic ways.

===Sorites paradox===
The ancient [[Sorites paradox]] first raised the logical problem of how we could exactly define the threshold at which a change in quantitative gradation turns into a qualitative or categorical difference.&lt;ref&gt;Rosanna Keefe &amp; Peter Smith, ''Vagueness: a reader.'' Cambridge, Mass.: MIT Press, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; With some physical processes this threshold is relatively easy to identify. For example, water turns into steam at 100&amp;nbsp;°C or 212&amp;nbsp;°F (the boiling point depends partly on atmospheric pressure, which decreases at higher altitudes). 

With many other processes and gradations, however, the point of change is much more difficult to locate, and remains somewhat vague. Thus, the boundaries between qualitatively different things may be ''unsharp'': we know that there are boundaries, but we cannot define them exactly. 

According to the modern idea of the [[continuum fallacy]], the fact that a statement is to an extent vague, does not automatically mean that it is invalid. The problem then becomes one of how we could ascertain the kind of validity that the statement does have.

===Loki's wager===
The Nordic myth of [[Loki's wager]] suggested that concepts that lack precise meanings or precise boundaries of application cannot be usefully discussed at all.&lt;ref&gt;Massimo Pigliucci &amp; Maarten Boudry (eds.), ''Philosophy of Pseudoscience: Reconsidering the Demarcation Problem''. University of Chicago Press, 2013, p. 95.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the 20th century idea of "fuzzy concepts" proposes that "somewhat vague terms" can be operated with, since we can explicate and define the variability of their application, by assigning numbers to gradations of applicability. This idea sounds simple enough, but it had large implications.

===Precursors===
The intellectual origins of the species of fuzzy concepts as a logical category have been traced back to a diversity of famous and less well-known thinkers,&lt;ref&gt;[[Nicholas Rescher]], ''Many-Valued Logic''. New York: McGraw-Hill, 1969.&lt;/ref&gt; including (among many others) [[Eubulides]], [[Plato]], [[Cicero]], [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]],&lt;ref&gt;Angelica Nuzzo, "Vagueness and Meaning Variance in Hegel’s Logic". In: Angelica Nuzzo, ''Hegel and the analytical tradition''. New York: Continuum International Publishing Group, 2010, pp. 61-82.

''International Journal of Innovation, Management and Technology'', Vol. 1, No. 3, August 2010.[http://ijimt.org/papers/58-M450.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Across at least two and a half millennia, all of them had something to say about graded concepts with unsharp boundaries. This suggests at least that the awareness of the existence of concepts with "fuzzy" characteristics, in one form or another, has a very long history in human thought. Quite a few logicians and philosophers have also tried to ''analyze'' the characteristics of fuzzy concepts as a recognized species, sometimes with the aid of some kind of [[many-valued logic]] or [[substructural logic]].

An early attempt in the post-WW2 era to create a theory of sets where set membership is a matter of degree was made by Abraham Kaplan and Hermann Schott in 1951. They intended to apply the idea to empirical research. Kaplan and Schott measured the degree of membership of empirical classes using real numbers between 0 and 1, and they defined corresponding notions of intersection, union, complementation and subset.&lt;ref&gt;Abraham Kaplan and Hermann F. Schott, "A calculus for empirical classes", ''Methodos'', Vol. 3, 1951, pp. 165–188.&lt;/ref&gt; However, at the time, their idea "fell on stony ground".&lt;ref&gt;Timothy Williamson, ''Vagueness''. London: Routledge, 1996, p. 120.&lt;/ref&gt; [[J. Barkley Rosser|J. Barkley Rosser Sr.]] published a treatise on many-valued logics in 1952, anticipating "many-valued sets".&lt;ref&gt;[[J. Barkley Rosser|J. Barkley Rosser Sr.]] and Atwell R. Turquette, ''Many-valued logics''. Amsterdam: North-Holland Publishing Company, 1952, p. 109.&lt;/ref&gt; Another treatise was published in 1963 by Aleksandr A. Zinov'ev and others&lt;ref&gt;Aleksandr A. Zinov'ev, David Dinsmore Comey and Guido Küng, ''Philosophical problems of many-valued logic''. Dordrecht: D. Reidel, 1963.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1964, the American philosopher [[William Alston]] introduced the term "degree vagueness" to describe vagueness in an idea that results from the absence of a definite cut-off point along an implied scale (in contrast to "combinatory vagueness" caused by a term that has a number of logically independent conditions of application).&lt;ref&gt;William P. Alston, ''Philosophy of Language''. Englewood Cliffs, N.J.: Prentice Hall, 1964, p. 87; William P. Alston, “Vagueness,” in Paul Edwards (ed.), ''Encyclopedia of Philosophy'', vol. 8. New York: Macmillan, first edition 1967, pp. 218–221; William P. Alston, ''A Realist Conception of Truth''. Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 1996 p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The German mathematician Dieter Klaua [https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dieter_Klaua] published a German-language paper on fuzzy sets in 1965,&lt;ref&gt;Dieter Klaua. "Über einen Ansatz zur mehrwertigen Mengenlehre". ''Monatsberichte der Deutschen Akademie der Wissenschaften'' (Berlin), Vol. 7, pp. 859–867, 1965. Siegfried Gottwald, "An early approach toward graded identity and graded membership in set theory". ''Fuzzy Sets and Systems''. Vol. 161 Issue 18, September 2010, pp. 2369–2379.&lt;/ref&gt; but he used a different terminology (he referred to "many-valued sets", not "fuzzy sets").&lt;ref&gt;Siegfried Gottwald, "Shaping the logic of fuzzy set theory". In: Cintula, Petr et al. (eds.), ''Witnessed years. Essays in honour of Petr Hájek''. London: College Publications, 2009, pp. 193–208. [http://www.uni-leipzig.de/~logik/gottwald/Hajek09.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

Two popular introductions to many-valued logic in the late 1960s were by Robert J. Ackermann and [[Nicholas Rescher]] respectively.&lt;ref&gt;Robert John Ackermann, ''An introduction to many-valued logics''. London, Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul, 1967; Nicholas Rescher, ''Many-Valued Logic''. New York: McGraw-Hill, 1969.&lt;/ref&gt; Rescher’s book includes a bibliography on fuzzy theory up to 1965, which was extended by Robert Wolf for 1966-1974.&lt;ref&gt; Robert G. Wolf, “A survey of many-valued logic (1966–1974)”, in: J. Michael Dunn and George Epstein (eds.), ''Modern Uses of Multiple-Valued Logic''. Dordrecht: D. Reidel, 1977, 167–323.&lt;/ref&gt; Haack provides references to significant works after 1974.&lt;ref&gt;[[Susan Haack]], ''Deviant logic, fuzzy logic: beyond the formalism''. Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; Bergmann provides a more recent (2008) introduction to fuzzy reasoning.&lt;ref&gt;Merrie  Bergmann, ''An  Introduction  to  Many-Valued  and  Fuzzy  Logic: Semantics, Algebras, and Derivation Systems''. Cambridge University Press, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lotfi Zadeh===
Usually the Iranian-born American computer scientist [[Lotfi Zadeh|Lotfi A. Zadeh]] (1921-2017) is credited with inventing the specific idea of a "fuzzy concept" in his seminal 1965 paper on fuzzy sets, because he gave a formal mathematical presentation of the phenomenon that was widely accepted by scholars.&lt;ref&gt;[[Lotfi Zadeh|Lotfi A. Zadeh]], "Fuzzy sets". In: ''Information and Control'', Vol. 8, June 1965, pp. 338–353.{{cite web|url=http://www-bisc.cs.berkeley.edu/Zadeh-1965.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-11-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071127005930/http://www-bisc.cs.berkeley.edu/Zadeh-1965.pdf |archivedate=2007-11-27 |df= See also A. Dumitras, &amp; G. Moschytz, "Understanding Fuzzy Logic: An Interview with Lotfi Zadeh". ''IEEE signal processing magazine'', May 2007, pp. 102-105.&lt;/ref&gt; It was also Zadeh who played a decisive role in developing the field of fuzzy logic, fuzzy sets and fuzzy systems, with a large number of scholarly papers.&lt;ref&gt;Radim Bělohlávek, Joseph W. Dauben &amp; George J. Klir, ''Fuzzy Logic and Mathematics: A Historical Perspective''. Oxford University Press, 2017. Lotfi A Zadeh with George J. Klir and Bo Yua, ''Fuzzy Sets, Fuzzy Logic, and Fuzzy Systems: Selected Papers''. Singapore and River Edge (N.J.): World Scientific Publishing Company, 1996. This last title includes a bibliography of Zadeh's writings up to 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike most philosophical theories of vagueness, Zadeh's engineering approach had the advantage that it could be directly applied to computer programming.&lt;ref&gt;Rudolf Seising, "Cybernetics, system(s) theory, information theory and Fuzzy Sets and Systems in the 1950s and 1960s". ''Information Sciences'' No. 180, 2010, pp. 4459-4476.&lt;/ref&gt;

Zadeh's seminal 1965 paper is acknowledged to be one of the most-cited scholarly articles in the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;''IFSA Newsletter'' (International Fuzzy Systems Association), Vol. 10, No. 1, March 2013 [http://isdlab.ie.ntnu.edu.tw/ntust/ifsa/files/newsletter/Vol10/IFSAnewsletterV10N1.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, it was placed 46th in the list of the world's 100 most-cited research papers of all time.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Van Noorden, Brendan Maher &amp; Regina Nuzzo, "The top 100 papers". ''Nature'', 29 October 2014.[https://www.nature.com/news/the-top-100-papers-1.16224]&lt;/ref&gt; Since the mid-1960s, many scholars have contributed to elaborating the theory of reasoning with graded concepts, and the research field continues to expand.&lt;ref&gt;Radim Bělohlávek, Joseph W. Dauben &amp; George J. Klir, ''Fuzzy Logic and Mathematics: A Historical Perspective''. Oxford University Press, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
The ordinary scholarly definition of a concept as "fuzzy" has been in use from the 1970s onward.

===Criteria===
Radim Bělohlávek explains:

{{Quotation|"There exists strong evidence, established in the 1970s in the psychology of concepts... that human concepts have a graded structure in that whether or not a concept applies to a given object is a matter of degree, rather than a yes-or-no question, and that people are capable of working with the degrees in a consistent way. This finding is intuitively quite appealing, because people say "this product is more or less good" or "to a certain degree, he is a good athlete", implying the graded structure of concepts. In his classic paper, Zadeh called the concepts with a graded structure ''fuzzy concepts'' and argued that these concepts are a rule rather than an exception when it comes to how people communicate knowledge. Moreover, he argued that to model such concepts mathematically is important for the tasks of control, decision making, pattern recognition, and the like. Zadeh proposed the notion of a ''[[fuzzy set]]'' that gave birth to the field of ''[[fuzzy logic]]''..."&lt;ref&gt;Radim Bělohlávek, "What is a fuzzy concept lattice? II", in: Sergei O. Kuznetsov et al. (eds.), ''Rough sets, fuzzy sets, data mining and granular computing.'' Berlin: Springer Verlag, 2011, pp. 19–20.[http://belohlavek.inf.upol.cz/publications/BeVy_Wifcl.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; }}

Hence, a concept is generally regarded as "fuzzy" in a logical sense if:
*defining characteristics of the concept apply to it "to a certain degree or extent" (or, more unusually, "with a certain magnitude of likelihood").&lt;ref&gt;The vast majority of scientific or scholarly users of the idea of fuzzy concepts refer to scaled (graded)  characteristics, and not to the variations in the ''likelihoods'' of their applicability.&lt;/ref&gt;
*or, the boundaries of applicability (the truth-value) of a concept can vary in degrees, according to different conditions. 
*or, the fuzzy concept itself straightforwardly consists of a [[fuzzy set]], or a combination of such sets.

The fact that a concept is fuzzy does not prevent its use in logical reasoning; it merely affects the type of reasoning which can be applied (see [[fuzzy logic]]). If the concept has gradations of meaningful significance, it is necessary to specify and formalize what those gradations are, if they can make an important difference. Not all fuzzy concepts have the same logical structure, but they can often be formally described or reconstructed using fuzzy logic or other [[substructural logic]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Nikolaos Galatos, Peter Jipsen, Tomasz Kowalski &amp; Hiroakira Ono, ''Residuated lattices: an algebraic glimpse at [[substructural logics]].'' Elsevier Science, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The advantage of this approach is, that numerical notation enables a potentially ''infinite'' number of truth-values between complete truth and complete falsehood, and thus it enables - in theory, at least - the greatest precision in stating the degree of applicability of a logical rule.

===Probability===
[[Petr Hájek]], writing about the foundations of fuzzy logic, sharply distinguished between "fuzziness" and "uncertainty":

{{Quotation|"The sentence "The patient is young" is true to some degree – the lower the age of the patient (measured e.g. in years), the more the sentence is true. Truth of a fuzzy proposition is a matter of degree. I recommend to everybody interested in fuzzy logic that they sharply distinguish fuzziness from uncertainty as a degree of belief (e.g. probability). Compare the last proposition with the proposition "The patient will survive next week". This may well be considered as a crisp proposition which is either (absolutely) true or (absolutely) false; but we do not know which is the case. We may have some probability (chance, degree of belief) that the sentence is true; but probability is not a degree of truth.&lt;ref&gt;[[Petr Hájek]], ''Metamathematics of fuzzy logic''. Dordrecht: Springer, 1998, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In [[metrology]] (the science of measurement), it is acknowledged that for any measure we care to make, there exists an [[Measurement uncertainty|amount of uncertainty]] about its accuracy, but this degree of uncertainty is conventionally expressed with a magnitude of likelihood, and not as a degree of truth. In 1975, [[Lotfi Zadeh|Lotfi A. Zadeh]] introduced a distinction between "Type 1 fuzzy sets" without uncertainty and "[[Type-2 fuzzy sets and systems|Type 2 fuzzy sets]]" with uncertainty, which has been widely accepted.&lt;ref&gt;[[Lotfi Zadeh|Lotfi A.

==Applications==
===Philosophy===
In philosophical [[logic]] and linguistics, fuzzy concepts are often regarded as vague concepts which in their application, or formally speaking, are neither completely true nor completely false, or which are partly true and partly false; they are ideas which require further elaboration, specification or qualification to understand their applicability (the conditions under which they truly make sense).&lt;ref&gt;[[Delia Graff Fara]], "Shifting Sands: An Interest Relative Theory of Vagueness". ''Philosophical Topics'', Vol. 28 No. 1, 2000, pp. 45-81.&lt;/ref&gt; The "fuzzy area" can also refer simply to a ''residual'' number of cases which cannot be allocated to a known and identifiable group, class or set if strict criteria are used.

===Sciences===
In [[mathematics]] and [[statistics]], a fuzzy variable (such as "the temperature", "hot" or "cold") is a value which could lie in a probable [[Range (mathematics)|range]] defined by some quantitative limits or [[parameters]], and which can be usefully described with imprecise categories (such as "high", "medium" or "low") using some kind of [[Level of measurement|scale]] or conceptual hierarchy.

===Fuzzy logic===
{{main|Fuzzy logic}}
In mathematics and [[computer science]], the gradations of applicable meaning of a fuzzy concept are described in terms of ''quantitative'' relationships defined by logical operators. Such an approach is sometimes called "degree-theoretic semantics" by logicians and philosophers,&lt;ref&gt;Roy T. Cook, ''A dictionary of philosophical logic''. Edinburgh University Press, 2009, p. 84.&lt;/ref&gt; but the more usual term is [[fuzzy logic]] or [[many-valued logic]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Nicholas Rescher]], ''Many-valued logic''. New York: McGraw-Hill, 1969.&lt;/ref&gt; The novelty of fuzzy logic is, that it "breaks with the traditional principle that [[formal system|formalisation]] should correct and avoid, but not compromise with, vagueness".&lt;ref&gt;[[Susan Haack]], ''Philosophy of Logics''. Cambridge University Press, 1978, p. xii.&lt;/ref&gt;

The basic idea of fuzzy logic is that a real number is assigned to each statement written in a language, within a range from 0 to 1, where 1 means that the statement is completely true, and 0 means that the statement is completely false, while values less than 1 but greater than 0 represent that the statements are "partly true", to a given, quantifiable extent. [[Susan Haack]] comments:

{{Quotation|"Whereas in classical set theory an object either is or is not a member of a given set, in fuzzy set theory membership is a matter of degree; the degree of membership of an object in a fuzzy set is represented by some real number between 0 and 1, with 0 denoting ''no'' membership and 1 ''full'' membership."&lt;ref&gt;[[Susan Haack]], ''Philosophy of Logics''. Cambridge University Press, 1978, p. 165.&lt;/ref&gt; }}

"Truth" in this mathematical context usually means simply that "something is the case", or that "something is applicable". This makes it possible to analyze a distribution of statements for their truth-content, identify data patterns, make inferences and predictions, and model how processes operate. 

[[Petr Hájek]] claimed that "fuzzy logic is not just some "applied logic", but may bring "new light to classical logical problems", and therefore might be well classified as a distinct branch of "philosophical logic" similar to e.g. [[Modal logic|modal logics]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Petr Hájek]], "Ten questions and one problem on fuzzy logic". ''Annals of Pure and Applied Logic'', Vol. 96, Issues 1-3, March 1999, 157-165, at p. 162.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Machinery &amp; analytics===

Fuzzy logic offers computationally-oriented systems of concepts and methods, to formalize types of reasoning which are ordinarily approximate only, and not exact. In principle, this allows us to give a definite, precise answer to the question, "To what extent is something the case?", or, "To what extent is something applicable?". Via a series of switches, this kind of reasoning can be built into electronic devices. That was already happening before fuzzy logic was invented, but using fuzzy logic in modelling has become an important aid in design, which creates many new technical possibilities.

Fuzzy reasoning (i.e., reasoning with graded concepts) turns out to have many practical uses.&lt;ref&gt;Kazuo Tanaka, ''An Introduction to Fuzzy Logic for Practical Applications''.

Humberto Bustince et al. (eds.), ''Fuzzy Sets and Their Extensions: Representation, Aggregation and Models. Intelligent Systems from Decision Making to Data Mining, Web Intelligence and Computer Vision.''  Berlin: Springer, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; It is nowadays widely used in:

It looks like fuzzy logic will eventually be applied in almost every aspect of life, even if people are not aware of it, and in that sense fuzzy logic is an astonishingly successful invention.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.goldengooseaward.org/awardees/fuzzy-logic "2017 Golden Goose Awardee: Fuzzy Logic, Clear Impact"]&lt;/ref&gt; The scientific and engineering literature on the subject is constantly increasing.

===Community===
Originally lot of research on fuzzy logic was done by Japanese pioneers inventing new machinery, electronic equipment and appliances (see also [[Fuzzy control system]]).&lt;ref&gt;Michio Sugeno (ed.), ''Industrial applications of fuzzy control''. Amsterdam: North Holland, 1992; Andrew Pollack, "Technology; Fuzzy Logic For Computers". ''New York Times'', 11 October 1984; Andrew Pollack, "Fuzzy Computer Theory: How to Mimic the Mind?" ''New York Times'', 2 April 1989.&lt;/ref&gt; The idea became so popular in Japan, that the English word entered Japanese language (ファジィ概念). "Fuzzy theory" (ファジー理論) is a recognized field in Japanese scientific research.

Since that time, the movement has spread worldwide; nearly every country nowadays has its own fuzzy systems association, although some are larger and more developed than others. In some cases, the local body is a branch of an international one. In other cases, the fuzzy systems program falls under [[artificial intelligence]] or [[soft computing]].

===Achievements===
[[Lotfi Zadeh|Lotfi A. Zadeh]] estimated around 2014 that there were more than 50,000 fuzzy logic–related, patented inventions. He listed 28 journals at that time dealing with fuzzy reasoning, and 21 journal titles on [[soft computing]]. His searches found close to 100,000 publications with the word "fuzzy" in their titles, but perhaps there are even 300,000.&lt;ref&gt;[[Lotfi Zadeh|Lotfi A. Zadeh]], "Factual Information about the Impact of Fuzzy Logic". Berkeley Initiative in Soft Computing, at Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences Department, University of Berkeley, California, circa 2014.[http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~zadeh/stimfl.html] For more details about the global fuzzy logic community, see [http://users.abo.fi/rfuller/fuzs.html].&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2018, [[Google Scholar]] found 2,870,000 titles which included the word "fuzzy". When he died on 11 September 2017 at age 96, Professor Zadeh had received more than 50 engineering and academic awards, in recognition of his work.&lt;ref&gt;Cade Metz, "Lotfi Zadeh, Father of Mathematical ‘Fuzzy Logic,’ Dies at 96." ''New York Times'', 11 September 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lattices and big data sets==
The technique of fuzzy concept lattices is increasingly used in programming for the formatting, relating and analysis of fuzzy data sets.

===Concept formalization===
According to the computer scientist Andrei Popescu at [[Middlesex University London]],&lt;ref&gt;Andrei Popescu, "A general approach to fuzzy concepts". ''Mathematical Logic Quarterly'' Vol. 50, No. 3, 2005, pp. 265–280.&lt;/ref&gt; a concept can be operationally defined to consist of: 
*an ''intent'', which is a description or specification stated in a language, 
*an ''extent'', which is the collection of all the objects to which the description refers, 
*a ''context'', which is stated by: (i) the universe of all possible objects, (ii) the universe of all possible attributes of objects, and (iii) the logical definition of the relation whereby an object possesses an attribute. 

Once the context is defined, we can specify relationships of sets of objects with sets of attributes which they do, or do not share.

===Fuzzy concept lattice===
Whether an object belongs to a concept, and whether an object does, or does not have an attribute, can often be a matter of degree. Thus, for example, "many attributes are fuzzy rather than crisp".&lt;ref&gt;Radim Bělohlávek and Vilem Vychodil, "What is a fuzzy concept lattice?" Department of Computer Science, Palacky University, Olomouc, 2005.[http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-162/paper2.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; To overcome this issue, a numerical value is assigned to each attribute along a scale, and the results are placed in a table which links each assigned object-value within the given range to a numerical value denoting a given degree of applicability.

This is the basic idea of a "fuzzy concept lattice", which can also be graphed; different fuzzy concept lattices can be connected to each other as well (for example, in "[[fuzzy clustering|fuzzy conceptual clustering]]" techniques used to group data, originally invented by [http://dblp2.uni-trier.de/pers/hd/r/Ruspini:Enrique_H= Enrique H. Ruspini]). Fuzzy concept lattices are a useful programming tool for the exploratory analysis of [[big data]], for example in cases where sets of linked behavioural responses are broadly similar, but can nevertheless vary in important ways, within certain limits. It can help to find out what the structure and dimensions are, of a behaviour that occurs with an important but limited amount of variation in a large population.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.compasss.org/index.htm See further the COMPASSS site]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Big data===
Coding with fuzzy lattices can be useful, for instance, in the [[psephological]] analysis of [[big data]] about voter behaviour, where researchers want to explore the characteristics and associations involved in "somewhat vague" opinions; gradations in voter attitudes; and variability in voter behaviour (or personal characteristics) within a set of parameters.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Kreiss, ''Prototype Politics: Technology-Intensive Campaigning and the Data of Democracy''.

Very large quantities of data can now be explored using computers with fuzzy logic programming&lt;ref&gt;For example, Kyle C. Longest and Stephen Vaisey, "Fuzzy: A program for Performing Qualitative Comparative Analyses (QCA) in Stata." ''Stata Journal'', Vol. 8 No. 1, 2008: pp. 79–104. Gregory Viot, "Fuzzy logic in C". ''Dr Dobb's journal'', 1 February 1993.[http://www.drdobbs.com/cpp/fuzzy-logic-in-c/184408940]&lt;/ref&gt; and open-source architectures such as [[Apache Hadoop]], [[Apache Spark]], and [[MongoDB]]. One author claimed in 2016 that it is now possible to obtain, link and analyze "400 data points" for each voter in a population, using [[Oracle Corporation|Oracle]] systems (a "data point" is a number linked to one or more categories, which represents a characteristic).&lt;ref&gt;Chris Preimesberger, "Big-Data Analytics Plays Big Role in 2016 Election Campaigns". ''eWeek'', 24 September 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, [[NBC News]] reported in 2016 that the Anglo-American firm [[Cambridge Analytica]] which profiled voters for [[Donald Trump]] ([[Steve Bannon]] was a board member)&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth P. Vogel, "The heiress quietly shaping Trump’s operation." ''Politico.com'', 21 November 2016.[http://www.politico.com/story/2016/11/rebekah-mercer-donald-trump-231693]&lt;/ref&gt; did not have 400, but 4,000 data points for each of 230 million US adults.&lt;ref&gt;Kate Brannely, "Trump Campaign Pays Millions to Overseas Big Data Firm." NBC News, 4 November 2016.[http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/2016-election-day/trump-campaign-pays-millions-overseas-big-data-firm-n677321]&lt;/ref&gt; Cambridge Analytica's own website claimed that "up to 5,000 data points" were collected for each of 220 million Americans, a data set of more than 1 trillion bits of formatted data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |work=[[Cambridge Analytica]] website |url=https://cambridgeanalytica.org/about |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160216023554/https://cambridgeanalytica.org/about |deadurl=yes |archivedate=2016-02-16 |title=Cambridge Analytica – About Us}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Guardian]]'' later claimed that Cambridge Analytica in fact had, according to its own company information, "up to 7,000 data points" on 240 million American voters.&lt;ref&gt;Carole Cadwalladr, "UK regulator orders Cambridge Analytica to release data on US voter". ''The Guardian'', 5 May 2018.[https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/may/05/cambridge-analytica-uk-regulator-release-data-us-voter-david-carroll]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Harvard University]] Professor [[Latanya Sweeney]] calculated, that if a U.S. company knows just your [[date of birth]], your [[ZIP code]] and [[sex]], the company has an 87% chance to identify you by name – simply by using linked data sets from various sources.&lt;ref&gt;Adam Tanner, "Nine Things You Don't Know About The Gathering Of Your Personal Data." ''Forbes Magazine'', 4 November 2014.[https://www.forbes.com/sites/adamtanner/2014/11/04/nine-things-you-dont-know-about-the-gathering-of-your-personal-data/#3faf581675b7]&lt;/ref&gt; With 4,000–7,000 data points instead of three, a very comprehensive personal profile becomes possible for almost every voter, and many behavioural patterns can be inferred by linking together different data sets. It also becomes possible to identify and measure gradations in personal characteristics which, in aggregate, have very large effects.

===Human judgement===
Some researchers argue that this kind of big data analysis has severe limitations, and that the analytical results can only be regarded as indicative, and not as definitive.&lt;ref&gt;Steve Lohr and Natasha Singernov, "How Data Failed Us in Calling an Election." ''[[New York Times]]'', 10 November 2016 [https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/10/technology/the-data-said-clinton-would-win-why-you-shouldnt-have-believed-it.html]&lt;/ref&gt; This was confirmed by [[Kellyanne Conway]], [[Donald Trump]]’s campaign advisor and counselor, who emphasized the importance of human judgement and common sense in drawing conclusions from fuzzy data.&lt;ref&gt;"How Trump won the presidency". Interview of Gerald F. Seib with [[Kellyanne Conway]], ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' (WSJ CEO Council full interview video), 14 November 2016.[https://www.wsj.com/video/how-trump-won-the-presidency/969FC367-31B3-436F-8388-6C9CE7546AC7.html] See also: Jonathan Vanian, "How Bad Polling Data Fooled Everyone Except Donald Trump".

====Propaganda machine====
In a video interview published by ''[[The Guardian]]'' in March 2018, whistleblower [[Christopher Wylie]] called [[Cambridge Analytica]] a "full-service propaganda machine" rather than a bona fide data science company. Its own site revealed with "case studies" that it has been active in political campaigns in numerous different countries, influencing attitudes and opinions.&lt;ref&gt;Jina Moore, "Cambridge Analytica Had a Role in Kenya Election, Too". ''New York Times'', 20 March 2018.[https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/20/world/africa/kenya-cambridge-analytica-election.html]&lt;/ref&gt; Wylie explained, that "we spent a million dollars harvesting tens of millions of [[Facebook]] profiles, and those profiles were used as the basis of the algorithms that became the foundation of Cambridge Analytica itself. The company itself was founded on using Facebook data".&lt;ref&gt;Carole Cadwalladr &amp; Emma Graham-Harrison, "Pressure mounts on Cambridge Analytica and Facebook over data scandal." ''[[The Guardian]]'', 18 March 2018.[https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/mar/18/cambridge-analytica-and-facebook-accused-of-misleading-mps-over-data-breach]&lt;/ref&gt; 
====Audit====
On 19 March 2018, [[Facebook]] announced it had hired the digital forensics firm Stroz Friedberg to conduct a "comprehensive audit" of Cambridge Analytica, while Facebook shares plummeted 7 percent overnight (erasing roughly $40 billion in market capitalization).&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Shieber, "Facebook hired a forensics firm to investigate [[Cambridge Analytica]] as stock falls 7%." ''TC Techcrunch.com'', 19 March 2018.[https://techcrunch.com/2018/03/19/facebook-hired-a-forensics-firm-to-investigate-cambridge-analytica-as-stock-falls-7/]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cambridge Analytica]] had not just used the profiles of [[Facebook]] users to compile data sets. According to [[Christopher Wylie]]'s testimony, the company also harvested the data of each user's network of friends, leveraging the original data set. It then converted, combined and migrated its results into ''new'' data sets, which can in principle survive in some format, even if the original data sources are destroyed. It created and applied algorithms using data to which - critics argue - it could not have been entitled. This was denied by [[Cambridge Analytica]], which stated on its website that it legitimately "uses data to change audience behavior" among customers and voters (who ''choose'' to view and provide information). If advertisers can do that, why not a data company? Where should the line be drawn? Legally, it remained a "fuzzy" area.
====Legal issue====
The tricky legal issue then became, what kind of data [[Cambridge Analytica]] (or any similar company) is actually allowed to have and keep.&lt;ref&gt;Spencer Phade, "Who Should Profit From Selling Your Personal Data?". ''Futures Platform'', 27 March 2018.[https://www.futuresplatform.com/blog/your-data-and-profit-data-scraping]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Facebook]] itself became the subject of another [[U.S. Federal Trade Commission]] inquiry, to establish whether Facebook violated the terms of a 2011 consent decree governing its handing of user data (data which was allegedly transferred to Cambridge Analytica without Facebook's and user's knowledge).&lt;ref&gt;David McLaughlin, Ben Brody, and Billy House, "FTC Probing Facebook for Use of Personal Data, Source Says." ''Bloomberg'', 20 March 2018; Tony Romm and Craig Timberg, "FTC opens investigation into Facebook after Cambridge Analytica scrapes millions of users’ personal information." ''Washington Post'', 20 March 2018.[https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2018/03/20/ftc-opens-investigation-into-facebook-after-cambridge-analytica-scrapes-millions-of-users-personal-information/]&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'' journalist Jessi Hempel commented in a CBNC panel discussion that "Now there is this fuzziness from the top of the company [i.e. Facebook] that I have never seen in the fifteen years that I have covered it."&lt;ref&gt;Sara Salinas, "Facebook hires firm to conduct a 'comprehensive audit' of Cambridge Analytica". ''CNBC news'', 19 March 2018 and squawkbox panel video [https://www.cnbc.com/2018/03/19/facebook-to-conduct-a-comprehensive-audit-of-cambridge-analytica.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Data privacy====
Interrogating Facebook's CEO [[Mark Zuckerberg]] before the U.S. [[House Energy and Commerce Committee]] in April 2018, New Mexico Congressman Rep. [[Ben Ray Luján]] put it to him that the Facebook corporation might well have "29,000 data points" on each Facebook user. Zuckerberg claimed that he "did not really know". Lujan's figure was based on [[ProPublica]] research, which in fact suggested that Facebook may even have 52,000 data points for many Facebook users.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Carbone, "Facebook might have 29,000 data points on you, but Mark Zuckerberg doesn't really know." ''Fox News'', 11 April 2018.[http://www.foxnews.com/tech/2018/04/11/facebook-might-have-29000-data-points-on-but-mark-zuckerberg-doesnt-really-know.html] [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VA1S5A4Yuxc] Julia Angwin, Surya Mattu and Terry Parris Jr., "Facebook Doesn’t Tell Users Everything It Really Knows About Them." ''ProPublica'', 27 December 2016.[https://www.propublica.org/article/facebook-doesnt-tell-users-everything-it-really-knows-about-them]&lt;/ref&gt; When Zuckerberg replied to his critics, he stated that because the revolutionary technology of Facebook (with 2.2 billion users worldwide) had ventured into previously unknown territory, it was unavoidable that mistakes would be made, despite the best of intentions. He justified himself saying that:

{{Quotation|"For the first ten or twelve years of the company, I viewed our responsibility primarily as building tools, that if we could put those tools in people's hands, then that would empower people to do good things. What we have learnt now... is that we need to take a more proactive role and a broader view of our responsibility."&lt;ref&gt;Zuckerberg's Senate hearings highlights video, 10 April 2018.[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EgI_KAkSyCw]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In July 2018, [[Facebook]] and [[Instagram]] barred access from [[Crimson Hexagon]], a company that advises corporations and governments using one trillion scraped social media posts, which it mined and processed with artificial intelligence and image analysis.&lt;ref&gt; Olivia Solon and Julia Carrie Wong, "Facebook suspends another analytics firm amid questions over surveillance." ''The Guardian'', 20 July 2018.[https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/jul/20/facebook-crimson-hexagon-analytics-data-surveillance]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Integrity====
It remained "fuzzy" what was more important to Zuckerberg: making money from user's information, or real corporate integrity in the use of personal information. Zuckerberg implied, that he believed that, on balance, Facebook had done ''more good than harm'', and that, if he had believed that wasn't the case, he would never have persevered with the business. Thus, "the good" was itself a fuzzy concept, because it was a matter of degree ("more good than bad"). He had to sell stuff, to keep the business growing. If people did not like Facebook, then they simply should not join it, or opt out, they have the choice.

After the ''[[New York Times]]'' broke the news on 17 March 2018, that copies of the Facebook data set scraped by Cambridge Analytica could still be downloaded from the Internet, Facebook was severely criticized by government representatives.&lt;ref&gt;Matthew Rosenberg, Nicholas Confessore and Carole Cadwalladr, "How [[Donald Trump|Trump]] Consultants Exploited the Facebook Data of Millions". ''[[New York Times]]'', 17 March 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; When questioned, Zuckerberg admitted that "In general we collect data on people who are not signed up for Facebook for security purposes" with the aim "to help prevent malicious actors from collecting public information from Facebook users, such as names". &lt;ref&gt;Sarah Frier and Todd Shields, "Zuckerberg Says Facebook Collects Internet Data on Non-Users", ''Bloomberg'', 11 April 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 2 May 2018, it was reported that the [[Cambridge Analytica]] company was shutting down and was starting bankruptcy proceedings, after losing clients and facing escalating legal costs.&lt;ref&gt;Rebecca Ballhaus and Jenny Gross, "Cambridge Analytica Closing Operations Following Facebook Data Controversy". ''Wall Street Journal'', 2 May 2018; Munsif Vengattil, "Cambridge Analytica and parent SCL Elections shutting down." ''Reuters'', 2 May 2018.[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-faceboook-privacy/cambridge-analytica-and-parent-scl-elections-shutting-down-idUSKBN1I32L7]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[reputational risk|reputational damage]] which the company had suffered or caused, had become too great.

===Speed===
A traditional objection to big data is, that it cannot cope with rapid change: events move faster that the statistics can keep up with. Yet the technology now exists for corporations like [[Amazon.com|Amazon]], [[Google]] and [[Microsoft]] to pump cloud-based data streams from app-users straight into big data analytics programmes, in real time.&lt;ref&gt;Tableau.com, ''Big data: the top 8 trends for 2016''.&lt;/ref&gt; Provided that the right kinds of analytical concepts are used, it is now technically possible to draw definite and important conclusions about gradations of human and natural behaviour using very large fuzzy data sets – and increasingly it can be done very fast. Obviously this achievement has become highly topical in military technology, but military uses can also have spin-offs for medical applications.&lt;ref&gt;Michael O'Hagan, "From military to medical and commercial applications of neural networks and fuzzy logic: a modern "swords-into-plowshares" play." ''Proceedings of IEEE WESCON '93'' conference, San Francisco, 28-30 Sept. 1993. Republished in ''EEE Xplore'', 6 August 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies==
There have been many academic controversies about the meaning, relevance and utility of fuzzy concepts.&lt;ref&gt;Radim Bělohlávek, George J. Klir, Harold W. Lewis III, Eileen C. Way, "Concepts and fuzzy sets: Misunderstandings, misconceptions, and oversights". ''International Journal of Approximate Reasoning'', Vol. 51, July 2009), pp. 23–34.[http://ac.els-cdn.com/S0888613X09001327/1-s2.0-S0888613X09001327-main.pdf?_tid=7f4bada4-37bd-11e7-9bfe-00000aacb361&amp;acdnat=1494667448_9f6a0acd8f43577a7af214d56512b12a] Angel Garrido &amp; Piedad Yuste, "controversies about the introduction of non-classical logics". ''Brain'', Vol. 5, No. 1-4, 2014.[http://www.edusoft.ro/brain/index.php/brain/article/view/457]&lt;/ref&gt;

==="Fuzzy" label===
[[Lotfi A. Zadeh]] himself confessed that:

{{Quotation|"I knew that just by choosing the label ''fuzzy'' I was going to find myself in the midst of a controversy... If it weren't called ''fuzzy logic'', there probably wouldn't be articles on it on the front page of the ''New York Times''. So let us say it has a certain publicity value. Of course, many people don't like that publicity value, and when they see it in the ''New York Times'', it doesn't sit well with them."&lt;ref&gt;Daniel McNeill &amp; Paul Freiberger, ''Fuzzy Logic: The Revolutionary Computer Technology that Is Changing Our World.'' New York: Simon &amp; Schuster, 1994, p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt; }}

However, the impact of the invention of fuzzy reasoning went far beyond names and labels. When Zadeh gave his acceptance speech in Japan for the 1989 Honda Foundation prize, which he received for inventing fuzzy theory, he stated that "The concept of a fuzzy set has had an upsetting effect on the established order."&lt;ref&gt;Daniel McNeill &amp; Paul Freiberger, ''Fuzzy Logic: The Revolutionary Computer Technology that Is Changing Our World.'' New York: Simon &amp; Schuster, 1994, p. 50. The Honda Foundation judged that Zadeh had taken an "active role in making the future of information society a more humane civilization", with a broad range of contributions in applied logic.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Do they exist===

Some philosophers and scientists have claimed that in reality "fuzzy" concepts do not exist.

====Frege====
According to ''[[The Foundations of Arithmetic]]'' by the logician [[Gottlob Frege]],

{{Quotation|"A definition of a concept... must be complete; it must unambiguously determine, as regards any object, whether or not it falls under the concept... the concept must have a sharp boundary... a concept that is not sharply defined is wrongly termed a concept. Such quasi-conceptual constructions cannot be recognized as concepts by logic. The [[Law of excluded middle|law of the excluded middle]] is really just another form of the requirement that the concept should have a sharp boundary."&lt;ref&gt;P. Geach and M. Black (eds.), ''Translations from the Philosophical Writings of Gottlob Frege'', 3rd edition. Blackwell, 1980, p. 159.&lt;/ref&gt; }}

====Kálmán====
Similarly, [[Rudolf E. Kálmán]] stated in 1972 that "there is no such thing as a fuzzy concept... We do talk about fuzzy things but they are not scientific concepts".&lt;ref&gt;[[Lotfi Zadeh|Lotfi A. Zadeh]], "Is there a need for fuzzy logic?", ''Information Sciences'', No. 178, 2008, p. 2753.&lt;/ref&gt;

The suggestion is that a concept, to qualify as a concept, must always be clear ''and'' precise, without any fuzziness. A vague notion would be at best a prologue to formulating a concept.&lt;ref&gt;For the debate between Zadeh and Kálmán, see: Lotfi A. Zadeh, "The birth and evolution of fuzzy logic". ''International Journal of General Systems'', Vol. 17, No. 2-3, 1990, pp. 95-105. See also: Yücel Yüksel, "On Zadeh’s 'The Birth and Evolution of Fuzzy Logic'". In: Eyke Hüllermeier, Rudolf Kruse &amp; Frank Hoffmann (eds.), ''Information Processing and Management of Uncertainty in Knowledge-Based Systems. Applications''.

Berlin: Springer, 2010,  pp 350-355. &lt;/ref&gt;

====DIN and ISO standards====
There is no general agreement among philosophers and scientists about how the notion of a "[[concept]]" (and in particular, a scientific concept), should be defined.&lt;ref&gt;Wolfgang G. Stock, "Concepts and Semantic Relations in Information Science". In: ''Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology'' Vol. 61 No. 10, October 2010, pp. 1951–1969.[https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220433962_Concepts_and_Semantic_Relations_in_Information_Science]; Eric Margolis &amp; Stephen Laurence, "Concepts". In: ''Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'', 2011.[https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/concepts/#ProThe]&lt;/ref&gt; A concept could be defined as a mental representation, as a cognitive capacity, as an abstract object, etc. Edward E. Smith &amp; Douglas L. Medin stated that “there will likely be no crucial experiments or analyses that will establish one view of concepts as correct and rule out all others irrevocably.”&lt;ref&gt;Edward E. Smith &amp; Douglas L. Medin, ''Categories and concepts''. Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1981, p. 182.&lt;/ref&gt; Of course, scientists also quite often do use imprecise analogies in their models to help understanding an issue.&lt;ref&gt;Pawel Zeidler, ''Models and Metaphors as Research Tools in Science''. Zurich: Lit Verlag, 2013; L. Magnani, N. J. Nersessian &amp; P. Thagard (eds.), Model-based reasoning in scientific discovery. New York : Kluwer Academic/Plenum Publishers, 1999; Jonathan Lawry, ''Modelling and reasoning with vague concepts''. New York: Springer, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; A concept can be clear enough, ''but not'' (or not sufficiently) precise.

Rather uniquely, terminology scientists at the German national standards institute (''Deutsches Institut für Normung'') provided an official standard definition of what a concept is (under the terminology standards DIN 2330 of 1957, completely revised in 1974 and last revised in 2013; and DIN 2342 of 1986, last revised in 2011).&lt;ref&gt;Go to [https://standards.globalspec.com/ Standards Library] for info.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the official German definition, a concept is a unit of thought which is created through abstraction for a set of objects, and which identifies shared (or related) characteristics of those objects.

The subsequent ISO definition is very similar. Under the ISO 1087 terminology standard of the [[International Standards Organization]] (first published in October 2000, and reviewed in 2005), a concept is defined as a unit of thought or an idea constituted through abstraction on the basis of properties common to a set of objects.&lt;ref&gt;See e.g. [https://www.iso.org/standard/20057.html] [https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#iso:std:iso:1087:-1:ed-1:v1:en] [http://wiki.julien-roche.fr/tiki-index.php?page=concept+3.2.1+version2+%28en%29&amp;structure=vocabulary]&lt;/ref&gt; It is acknowledged that although a concept usually has one definition or one meaning, it may have multiple designations, terms of expression, symbolizations or representations. Thus, for example, the same concept can have different names in different languages. Both verbs and nouns can express concepts. A concept can also be thought of as "a way of looking at the world".

===Corruption===
Reasoning with fuzzy concepts is often viewed as a kind of "logical corruption" or scientific perversion because, it is claimed, fuzzy reasoning rarely reaches a definite "yes" or a definite "no". A clear, precise and logically rigorous conceptualization is no longer a necessary prerequisite, for carrying out a procedure, a project, or an inquiry, since "somewhat vague ideas" can always be accommodated, formalized and programmed with the aid of fuzzy expressions. The purist idea is, that either a rule applies, or it does not apply. When a rule is said to apply only "to some extent", then in truth the rule does ''not'' apply. Thus, a compromise with vagueness or indefiniteness is, on this view, effectively a compromise with error - an error of conceptualization, an error in the inferential system, or an error in physically carrying out a task.
====Kahan====
The computer scientist [[William Kahan]] argued in 1975 that "the danger of fuzzy theory is that it will encourage the sort of imprecise thinking that has brought us so much trouble."&lt;ref&gt;Lotfi A. Zadeh, "The birth and evolution of fuzzy logic". ''International Journal of General Systems'', Vol. 17, No. 2-3, 1990, pp. 95-105, at p. 98.&lt;/ref&gt; He said subsequently,

{{Quotation|"With traditional logic there is no guaranteed way to find that something is contradictory, but once it is found, you'd be obliged to do something. But with fuzzy sets, the existence of contradictory sets can't cause things to malfunction. Contradictory information doesn't lead to a clash. You just keep computing. (...) Life affords many instances of getting the right answer for the wrong reasons... It is in the nature of logic to confirm or deny. The fuzzy calculus blurs that. (...) Logic isn't following the rules of Aristotle blindly. It takes the kind of pain known to the runner. He knows he is doing something. When you are thinking about something hard, you'll feel a similar sort of pain. Fuzzy logic is marvellous. It insulates you from pain. It's the [[cocaine]] of science."&lt;ref&gt;Daniel McNeill &amp; Paul Freiberger, ''Fuzzy Logic: The Revolutionary Computer Technology that Is Changing Our World.'' New York: Simon &amp; Schuster, 1994, pp. 47-48.&lt;/ref&gt; }}
According to Kahan, statements of a degree of probability are usually verifiable. There are standard tests one can do. By contrast, there is no conclusive procedure which can decide the validity of assigning particular fuzzy truth values to a data set in the first instance. It is just assumed that a model or program will work, "if" particular fuzzy values are accepted and used, perhaps based on some statistical comparisons or try-outs.

====Bad design====
In programming, a problem can usually be solved in several different ways, not just one way, but an important issue is, which solution works best in the short term, and in the long term. Kahan implies, that fuzzy solutions may create more problems in the long term, than they solve in the short term. For example, if one starts off designing a procedure, not with well thought-out, precise concepts, but rather by using fuzzy or approximate expressions which conveniently patch up (or compensate for) badly formulated ideas, the ultimate result could be a complicated, malformed mess, that does not achieve the intended goal.

Had the reasoning and conceptualization been much sharper at the start, then the design of the procedure might have been much simpler, more efficient and effective - and fuzzy expressions or approximations would not be necessary, or required much less. Thus, by ''allowing'' the use of fuzzy or approximate expressions, one might actually foreclose more rigorous thinking about design, and one might build something that ultimately does not meet expectations. 

If (say) an entity X turns out to belong for 65% to category Y, and for 35% to category Z, how should X be allocated? One could plausibly decide to allocate X to Y, making a rule that, if an entity belongs for 65% or more to Y, it is to be treated as an instance of category Y, and never as an instance of category Z. One could, however, alternatively decide to change the definitions of the categorization system, to ensure that all entities such as X fall 100% in one category only. 

This kind of argument claims, that boundary problems can be resolved (or vastly reduced) simply by using better categorization or conceptualization methods. If we treat X "as if" it belongs 100% to Y, while in truth it only belongs 65% to Y, then arguably we are really misrepresenting things. If we keep doing that with a lot of related variables, we can greatly distort the true situation, and make it look like something that it isn't.

In a "fuzzy permissive" environment, it might become far too easy, to formalize and use a concept which is itself badly defined, and which could have been defined much better. In that environment, there is always a quantitative way out, for concepts that do not quite fit, or which don't quite do the job for which they are intended. The cumulative adverse effect of the discrepancies might, in the end, be much larger than ever anticipated.

====Counter-argument====
A typical reply to Kahan's objections is, that fuzzy reasoning never "rules out" ordinary binary logic, but instead ''presupposes'' ordinary true-or-false logic. [[Lotfi Zadeh]] stated that "fuzzy logic is not fuzzy. In large measure, fuzzy logic is precise."&lt;ref&gt;A. Dumitras, &amp; G. Moschytz, "Understanding Fuzzy Logic: An Interview with Lotfi Zadeh". ''IEEE signal processing magazine'', May 2007, pp. 102-105, at p. 103.&lt;/ref&gt; It is a precise logic of imprecision. Fuzzy logic is not a replacement of, or substitute for ordinary logic, but an enhancement of it, with many practical uses. Fuzzy thinking does oblige action, but primarily in response to a change in quantitative gradation, not in response to a contradiction.

One could say, for example, that ultimately one is ''either'' "alive" ''or'' "dead", which is perfectly true. Meantime though one is "living", which is also a significant truth - yet "living" is a fuzzy concept. It is true that fuzzy logic by itself usually cannot eliminate inadequate conceptualization or bad design. Yet it can at least make explicit, what exactly the variations are in the applicability of a concept which has unsharp boundaries.

If one always had perfectly crisp concepts available, perhaps no fuzzy expressions would be necessary. In reality though, one often does not have all the crisp concepts to start off with. One might not have them yet for a long time, or ever - or, several successive "fuzzy" approximations might be needed, to get there. 

At a deeper level, a "fuzzy permissive" environment may be desirable, precisely because it permits things to be actioned, that would never have been achieved, if there had been crystal clarity about all the consequences from the start, or if people insisted on absolute precision prior to doing anything. Scientists often try things out on the basis of "hunches", and processes like [[serendipity]] can play a role. 

Learning something new, or trying to create something new, is rarely a completely formal-logical or linear process, there are not only "knowns" and "unknowns" involved, but also "''partly'' known" phenomena, i.e. things which are known or unknown "to some degree". Even if, ideally, we would prefer to eliminate fuzzy ideas, we might need them initially to get there, further down the track. Any method of reasoning is a tool. If its application has bad results, it is not the tool itself that is to blame, but its inappropriate use. It would be better to educate people in the best ''use'' of the tool, if necessary with appropriate authorization, than to ''ban'' the tool pre-emptively, on the ground that it "could" or "might" be abused. Exceptions to this rule would include things like computer viruses and illegal weapons that can only cause great harm if they are used. There is no evidence though that fuzzy concepts as a species are intrinsically harmful, even if some bad concepts can cause harm if used in inappropriate contexts.

===Reducibility===

[[Susan Haack]] once claimed that a many-valued logic requires neither intermediate terms between true and false, nor a rejection of bivalence.&lt;ref&gt;Susan Haack, Philosophy of Logics. Cambridge University Press, 1978, p. 213.&lt;/ref&gt; Her suggestion was, that the intermediate terms (i.e. the gradations of truth) can always be restated as conditional if-then statements, and by implication, that fuzzy logic is fully reducible to binary true-or-false logic. 

This interpretation is disputed, but even if it was correct, assigning a number to the applicability of a statement is often enormously more efficient than a long string of if-then statements that would have the same intended meaning. That point is obviously of great importance to computer programmers, educators and administrators seeking to code a process, activity, message or operation as simply as possible, according to logically consistent rules.

===Quantification===
It may be wonderful to have access to an unlimited number of distinctions to define what one means, but not all scholars would agree that any concept is equal to, or reducible to, a mathematical [[Set theory|set]].&lt;ref&gt;Susan L. Epstein, "Memory and concepts in reactive learning". ''Proceedings of the Canadian Workshop on Machine Learning 1992''[http://www.cs.hunter.cuny.edu/~epstein/papers/CSCSI92.pdf].&lt;/ref&gt; Some phenomena are difficult or impossible to quantify and count, in particular if they lack discrete boundaries (for example, clouds).

====Formalization====
Qualities may not be fully reducible to quantities&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Mumford, "Quantities and Qualities", University of Nottingham blog post, September 30, 2012.[https://blogs.nottingham.ac.uk/artsmatters/2012/09/30/quantities-and-qualities/]&lt;/ref&gt; – if there are no qualities, it may become impossible to say what the numbers are numbers of, or what they refer to, except that they refer to other numbers or numerical expressions such as algebraic equations. A measure requires a counting unit defined by a category, but the definition of that category is essentially qualitative; a language which is used to communicate data is difficult to operate, without any qualitative distinctions and categories. We may, for example, transmit a text in binary code, but the binary code does not tell us directly what the text intends.

In creating a [[formal system|formalization]] or [[formal specification]] of a concept, for example for the purpose of measurement, administrative procedure or programming, part of the meaning of the concept may be changed or lost.&lt;ref&gt;Robert M. Wachter, "How Measurement Fails Doctors and Teachers". ''New York Times'', 16 January 2016.[https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/17/opinion/sunday/how-measurement-fails-doctors-and-teachers.html?_r=0]&lt;/ref&gt; For example, if we deliberately program an event according to a concept, it might kill off the spontaneity, spirit, authenticity and motivational pattern which is ordinarily associated with that type of event.

[[Quantification (science)|Quantification]] is not an unproblematic process.&lt;ref&gt;“A well-known quotation usually attributed to Einstein is “Not everything that can be counted counts, and not everything that counts can be counted.” I’d amend it to a less eloquent, more prosaic statement: unless we know how things are counted, we don’t know if it’s wise to count on the numbers. The problem isn’t with statistical tests themselves but with what we do before and after we run them. First, we count if we can, but counting depends a great deal on previous assumptions about categorization. (...) Second, after we’ve gathered some numbers relating to a phenomenon, we must reasonably aggregate them into some sort of recommendation or ranking. This is not easy. By appropriate choices of criteria, measurement protocols and weights, almost any desired outcome can be reached." - John Allen Paulos, "Metric Mania", in ''New York Times'', 10 May 2010.[https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/16/magazine/16FOB-WWLN-t.html] Whether Einstein really did originate the quotation which Paulos mentions, is in dispute. The quote is also credited to William Bruce Cameron, ''Informal Sociology, a casual introduction to sociological thinking''. New York: Random House, 1963, p. 13.[http://quoteinvestigator.com/2010/05/26/everything-counts-einstein/]&lt;/ref&gt; To quantify a phenomenon, we may have to introduce special assumptions and definitions which disregard part of the phenomenon in its totality. 
*The economist [[John Maynard Keynes]] concluded that formalization "runs the risk of leaving behind the subjectmatter we are interested in" and "also runs the risk of increasing rather than decreasing the muddle."&lt;ref&gt;J.

Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2009, pp. 20-21.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Measurement====
Programmers, statisticians or logicians are concerned in their work with the main operational or technical significance of a concept which is specifiable in objective, quantifiable terms. They are not primarily concerned with all kinds of imaginative frameworks associated with the concept, or with those aspects of the concept which seem to have no particular functional purpose – however entertaining they might be. However, some of the qualitative characteristics of the concept may not be quantifiable or measurable at all, at least not directly. The temptation exists to ignore them, or try to infer them from data results.

If, for example, we want to count the number of trees in a forest area with any precision, we have to define what counts as one tree, and perhaps distinguish them from saplings, split trees, dead trees, fallen trees etc. Soon enough it becomes apparent that the quantification of trees involves a degree of abstraction – we decide to disregard some timber, dead or alive, from the population of trees, in order to count those trees that conform to our chosen concept of a tree. We operate in fact with an abstract concept of what a tree is, which diverges to some extent from the true diversity of trees there are. 

Even so, there may be some trees, of which it is not very clear, whether they should be counted as a tree, or not; a certain amount of "fuzziness" in the concept of a tree may therefore remain. The implication is, that the seemingly "exact" number offered for the total quantity of trees in the forest may be much less exact than one might think - it is probably more an estimate or indication of magnitude, rather than an exact description.&lt;ref&gt;What statisticians then often try to do, is to create a model which can predict the magnitude of the difference between the true (accurate and exact) number and the computed number obtained, in this case the true number of trees. Such a model however still relies on imperfect or fallible definitions. Even if fuzzy values are used instead, it is likely that a definite and exact number can never be reached. At most one can say that the number is correct, if the definitions are accepted.&lt;/ref&gt; Yet - and this is the point - the imprecise measure can be very useful and sufficient for all intended purposes.

It is tempting to think, that if something can be measured, it must exist, and that if we cannot measure it, it does not exist. Neither might be true. Researchers try to measure such things as intelligence or gross domestic product, without much scientific agreement about what these things actually are, how they exist, and what the correct measures might be.

When one wants to count and quantify distinct objects using numbers, one needs to be able to distinguish between those separate objects, but if this is difficult or impossible, then, although this may not invalidate a quantitative procedure as such, quantification is not really possible in practice; at best, we may be able to assume or infer indirectly a certain distribution of quantities that must be there. In this sense, scientists often use [[Proxy (statistics)|proxy variables]] to substitute as measures for variables which are known (or thought) to be there, but which themselves cannot be observed or measured directly.

===Vague or fuzzy===
The exact relationship between vagueness and fuzziness is disputed.

====Philosophy====
Philosophers often regard fuzziness as a particular kind of vagueness,&lt;ref&gt;Susan Haack, ''Deviant logic, fuzzy logic - beyond the formalism.'' Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; and consider that "no specific assignment of semantic values to vague predicates, not even a fuzzy one, can fully satisfy our conception of what the extensions of vague predicates are like".&lt;ref&gt;Matti Eklund, "Vagueness and Second-Level Indeterminacy", in: Richard Dietz &amp; Sebastiano Moruzzi (eds.), ''Cuts and clouds. Vagueness, Its Nature, and Its Logic.'' Oxford University Press, 2009, p. 65.&lt;/ref&gt; Surveying recent literature on how to characterize vagueness, Matti Eklund states that appeal to lack of sharp boundaries, borderline cases and “sorites-susceptible" predicates are the three informal characterizations of vagueness which are most common in the literature.&lt;ref&gt;Matti Eklund, "Characterizing Vagueness". ''Philosophy Compass'', 2, 2007, pp. 896-909.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Zadeh's argument====
However, [[Lotfi Zadeh|Lotfi A. Zadeh]] claimed that "vagueness connotes insufficient [[specificity (statistics)|specificity]], whereas fuzziness connotes unsharpness of [[Class (set theory)|class boundaries]]". Thus, he argued, a sentence like "I will be back in a few minutes" is fuzzy ''but not'' vague, whereas a sentence such as "I will be back sometime", is fuzzy ''and'' vague. His suggestion was that fuzziness and vagueness are logically quite different qualities, rather than fuzziness being a type or subcategory of vagueness. Zadeh claimed that "inappropriate use of the term 'vague' is still a common practice in the literature of philosophy".&lt;ref&gt;[[Lotfi Zadeh|Lotfi A. Zadeh]], "What is fuzzy logic?". ''IFSA Newsletter'' (International Fuzzy Systems Association), Vol. 10, No. 1, March 2013, pp. 5–6.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ethics===

In the scholarly inquiry about [[ethics]] and [[meta-ethics]], vague or fuzzy concepts and borderline cases are standard topics of controversy. Central to ethics are theories of "value", what is "good" or "bad" for people and why that is, and the idea of "rule following" as a condition for moral integrity, consistency and non-arbitrary behaviour. 

Yet, if human valuations or moral rules are only vague or fuzzy, then they may not be able to orient or guide behaviour. It may become impossible to operationalize rules. Evaluations may not permit definite moral judgements, in that case. Hence, clarifying fuzzy moral notions is usually considered to be critical for the ethical endeavour as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;Tom Dougherty, "Vague value", in: ''Philosophy and phenomenological research'', Vol. 89, No. 2, September 2014, pp. 352–372 [https://philpapers.org/archive/DOUVV.pdf]; Tom Dougherty, "Vagueness and Indeterminacy in Ethics". In: Tristram McPherson &amp; David Plunkett, ''The Routledge Handbook of Metaethics''. Oxford: Routledge, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Excessive precision====
Nevertheless, [[Scott Soames]] has made the case that vagueness or fuzziness can be ''valuable'' to rule-makers, because "their use of it is valuable to the people to whom rules are addressed".&lt;ref&gt;Scott Soames, "The Value of Vagueness." Chapter 2 in: Andrei Marmor &amp; Scott Soames, ''Philosophical Foundations of Language in the Law''. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2013, pp. 26-43, at p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt; It may be more practical and effective to allow for some leeway (and personal responsibility) in the interpretation of how a rule should be applied - bearing in mind the overall purpose which the rule intends to achieve. 

If a rule or procedure is stipulated too exactly, it can sometimes have a result which is contrary to the aim which it was intended to help achieve. For example, "The [[Children and Young Persons Act 2008|Children and Young Persons Act]] could have specified a precise age below which a child may not be left unsupervised. But doing so would have incurred quite substantial forms of arbitrariness (for various reasons, and particularly because of the different capacities of children of the same age)".&lt;ref&gt;Scott Soames, "The Value of Vagueness." Chapter 2 in: Andrei Marmor &amp; Scott Soames, ''Philosophical Foundations of Language in the Law''. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2013, pp. 26-43, at p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Rule conflict====
A related sort of problem is, that if the application of a legal concept is pursued too exactly and rigorously, it may have consequences that cause a serious conflict with ''another'' legal concept. This is not necessarily a matter of bad law-making. When a law is made, it may not be possible to anticipate all the cases and events to which it will apply later (even if 95% of possible cases are predictable). The longer a law is in force, the more likely it is, that people will run into problems with it, that were not foreseen when the law was made. 

So, the further implications of one rule may conflict with another rule. "Common sense" might not be able to resolve things. In that scenario, too much precision can get in the way of justice. Very likely a special court ruling wil have to set a norm. The general problem for jurists is, whether "the arbitrariness resulting from precision is worse than the arbitrariness resulting from the application of a vague standard".&lt;ref&gt;Scott Soames, "The Value of Vagueness." Chapter 2 in: Andrei Marmor &amp; Scott Soames, ''Philosophical Foundations of Language in the Law''. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2013, pp. 26-43, at p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mathematics===
The definitional disputes about fuzziness remain unresolved so far, mainly because, as anthropologists and psychologists have documented, different languages (or symbol systems) that have been created by people to signal meanings suggest different [[ontology|ontologies]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Alfred Korzybski]], ''Science and Sanity: An Introduction to Non-Aristotelian Systems and General Semantics'' (5th ed.). Forest Hills, N.Y.: Institute of General Semantics, 1995. [[Gregory Bateson]], ''Steps to an Ecology of Mind: Collected Essays in Anthropology, Psychiatry, Evolution, and Epistemology''. Chicago: University Of Chicago Press, 1972.&lt;/ref&gt; Put simply: it is not merely that describing "what is there" involves symbolic representations of some kind. How distinctions are drawn, influences perceptions of "what is there", and vice versa, perceptions of "what is there" influence how distinctions are drawn.&lt;ref&gt;Vassos Argyrou, "Anthropology of Magic". In: James D. Wright (ed.), ''International Encyclopedia of the Social &amp; Behavioural Sciences''. Amsterdam: Elsevier, 2015, 2nd edition, Vol. 14, p. 438. Dominic Hyde, ''Vagueness, Logic and Ontology''. Aldershot: Ashgate Publishing Ltd, 2008. See also [[object-oriented ontology]].&lt;/ref&gt; This is an important reason why, as [[Alfred Korzybski]] noted, people frequently confuse the symbolic representation of reality, conveyed by languages and signs, with reality itself.&lt;ref&gt;[[Alfred Korzybski]], ''Science and Sanity: An Introduction to Non-Aristotelian Systems and General Semantics'' (5th ed.). Forest Hills, N.Y.: Institute of General Semantics, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;

Fuzziness implies, that there exists a potentially ''infinite'' number of truth values between complete truth and complete falsehood. If that is the case, it creates the foundational issue of what, in the case, can justify or prove the existence of the categorical absolutes which are assumed by logical or quantitative inference. If there is an infinite number of shades of grey, how do we know what is totally black and white, and how could we identify that?
====Tegmark====
To illustrate the ontological issues, cosmologist [[Max Tegmark]] argues boldly that the universe consists of math: "If you accept the idea that both space itself, and all the stuff in space, have no properties at all except mathematical properties," then the idea that everything is mathematical "starts to sound a little bit less insane."&lt;ref&gt;Tanya Lewis, "What's the Universe Made Of? Math, Says Scientist." ''Live Science'', 30 January 2014.[http://www.livescience.com/42839-the-universe-is-math.html]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Tegmark moves from the ''[[Epistemology|epistemic]]'' claim that mathematics is the only known symbol system which can in principle express absolutely everything, to the ''[[Methodology|methodological]]'' claim that everything is reducible to mathematical relationships, and then to the ''[[Ontology|ontological]]'' claim, that ultimately everything that exists is mathematical (the [[mathematical universe hypothesis]]). The argument is then reversed, so that ''because'' everything is mathematical in reality, mathematics is ''necessarily'' the ultimate universal symbol system.

The main criticisms of Tegmark's approach are that (1) the steps in this argument do not necessarily follow, (2) no conclusive proof or test is possible for the claim that such an exhaustive mathematical expression or reduction is feasible, and (3) it may be that a complete reduction to mathematics cannot be accomplished, without at least partly altering, negating or deleting a non-mathematical significance of phenomena, experienced perhaps as [[qualia]].&lt;ref&gt;See also Raphael van Riel &amp; Robert Van Gulick, "Scientific reduction". In: ''Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'', 2014.[https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/scientific-reduction/]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Zalta====
In his [[meta-mathematics|meta-mathematical]] [[metaphysics]], [[Edward N. Zalta]] has claimed that for every set of properties of a concrete object, there ''always'' exists ''exactly'' one abstract object that encodes ''exactly'' that set of properties and no others - a foundational assumption or [[axiom]] for his [[ontology]] of abstract objects&lt;ref&gt;[[Edward N. Zalta]], ''Abstract Objects. An introduction to axiomatic metaphysics''. Dordrecht: D. Reidel Publishing Company, 1983.&lt;/ref&gt; By implication, for every fuzzy object there exists always at least one [[defuzzification|defuzzified]] concept which encodes it exactly. It is a modern interpretation of [[Plato]]'s [[Platonic epistemology|metaphysics of knowledge]],&lt;ref&gt;Norman Gulley, ''Plato's theory of knowledge''[1962]. Milton Park: Routledge, 2013, chapter 4.&lt;/ref&gt; which expresses confidence in the ability of science to conceptualize the world exactly.

====Platonism====
The Platonic-style interpretation was critiqued by [[Hartry H. Field]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Hartry H. Field]], ''Science without numbers. A defense of nominalism.'' Second edition, Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Mark Balaguer argues that we do not really know whether mind-independent abstract objects exist or not; so far, we cannot prove whether [[Platonic realism]] is definitely true or false.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Balaguer, ''Platonism and Anti-Platonism in Mathematics''. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; Defending a cognitive realism, [[Scott Soames]] argues that the reason why this unsolvable conundrum has persisted, is because the ultimate constitution of the meaning of concepts and propositions was misconceived.

Traditionally, it was thought that concepts can be truly representational, because ultimately they are related to intrinsically representational Platonic complexes of [[Problem of universals|universals]] and [[particular]]s. However, once concepts and propositions are regarded as cognitive-event types, it is possible to claim that they are able to be representational, because they are constitutively related to intrinsically representational cognitive acts in the real world.&lt;ref&gt;"Unlike the platonic epistemology required by the classic Frege-Russell account... the epistemology of naturalized propositions sees acquaintance with, and knowledge of, propositions as rooted in acquaintance with, and knowledge of, acts and events that make up one's cognitive life" - Scott Soames, ''What is meaning?''. Princeton: Princeton University Press, 2010, p. 106.&lt;/ref&gt; As another philosopher put it, 
{{Quotation|"The question of how we can know the world around us is not entirely unlike the question of how it is that the food our environment provides happens to agree with our stomachs. Either can become a mystery if we forget that minds, like stomachs, originated in and have been conditioned by a pre-existent natural order."&lt;ref&gt;William Ashley, ''Marxism and moral concepts''. New York: Monthly Review Press, 1964, pp. 4-5. Similarly, [[Paul Lafargue]] had written in his essay "The Origin of Abstract Ideas" (1900) that "The brain has the property of thinking as the stomach has that of digesting. It cannot think but by the aid of ideas, which it fabricates with the materials furnished it by the natural environment and the social or artificial environment in which man evolves." [https://www.marxists.org/archive/lafargue/1898/xx/abstract.htm]
&lt;/ref&gt; }}
Along these lines, it could be argued that reality, and the human cognition of reality, will inevitably contain some fuzzy characteristics, which can be represented only by concepts which are themselves fuzzy to some or other extent.

==Social science and the media==
The idea of fuzzy concepts has also been applied in the philosophical, sociological and linguistic analysis of human behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;John Coates, ''The claims of common sense; Moore, Wittgenstein, Keynes and the social sciences''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sociology and linguistics===
In a 1973 paper, [[George Lakoff]] analyzed hedges in the interpretation of the meaning of categories.&lt;ref&gt;[[George Lakoff]], "Hedges: A Study in Meaning Criteria and the Logic of Fuzzy Concepts." ''Journal of Philosophical Logic'', Vol. 2, 1973, pp. 458–508.[http://georgelakoff.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/hedges-a-study-in-meaning-criteria-and-the-logic-of-fuzzy-concepts-journal-of-philosophical-logic-2-lakoff-19731.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Charles Ragin]] and others have applied the idea to sociological analysis.&lt;ref&gt;[[Charles Ragin]], ''Redesigning Social Inquiry: Fuzzy Sets and Beyond''. University of Chicago Press, 2008. Shaomin Li, "Measuring the fuzziness of human thoughts: An application of fuzzy sets to sociological research". ''The Journal of Mathematical Sociology'', Volume 14, Issue 1, 1989, pp. 67–84; Mario Quaranta, "Fuzzy set theory and concepts: a proposal for concept formation and operationalization". ''Comparative Sociology'' Vol. 12, issue 6, 2013, pp. 785-820.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis ("fsQCA") has been used by German researchers to study problems posed by ethnic diversity in Latin America.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Stoiber, Frederik Caselitz, Marie Sophie Heinelt, “How to deal with socio-ethnic conflicts in Latin America?

Applications and Methodological Challenges”, November 22–23, 2013, Goethe University Frankfurt.[https://www.fernuni-hagen.de/conpar/download/stoibercaselitzheinelt.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; In [[New Zealand]], [[Taiwan]], [[Iran]], [[Malaysia]], the [[European Union]] and [[Croatia]], economists have used fuzzy concepts to model and measure the underground economy of their country.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Draeseke &amp; David E.A. Giles, "A fuzzy logic approach to modelling the New Zealand underground economy." ''Mathematics and Computers in Simulation'', Vol. 59, No. 1, 2002, pp. 115–123.

In: ''Journal of Information and organizational Sciences'', Vol. 49, No. 1, 2016, pp.83-104.&lt;/ref&gt; Kofi Kissi Dompere applied methods of fuzzy decision, approximate reasoning, negotiation games and fuzzy mathematics to analyze the role of money, information and resources in a "political economy of rent-seeking", viewed as a game played between powerful corporations and the government.&lt;ref&gt;Kofi Kissi Dompere, ''Fuzziness, democracy, control and collective decision choice system: a theory on political economy of rent-seeking and profit-harvesting''. Heidelberg: Springer, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

A concept may be deliberately created by sociologists as an [[ideal type]] to understand something imaginatively, without any strong claim that it is a "true and complete description" or a "true and complete reflection" of whatever is being conceptualized.&lt;ref&gt;Edward A. Shils &amp; Henry A. Finch (eds.), ''Max Weber on the methodology of the social sciences''. Glencoe, Ill.: The Free Press, 1949, p. 93.&lt;/ref&gt; 
In a more general sociological or journalistic sense, a "fuzzy concept" has come to mean a concept which is meaningful but inexact, implying that it does not exhaustively or completely define the meaning of the phenomenon to which it refers – often because it is too abstract. In this context, it is said that fuzzy concepts "lack clarity and are difficult to test or operationalize".&lt;ref&gt;Ann Markusen, "Fuzzy Concepts, Scanty Evidence, Policy Distance: The Case for Rigour and Policy Relevance in Critical Regional Studies." In: ''Regional Studies'', Volume 37, Issue 6-7, 2003, pp. 701–717.&lt;/ref&gt; To specify the relevant meaning more precisely, additional distinctions, conditions and/or qualifiers would be required.

A few examples can illustrate this kind of usage:
*a handbook of sociology states that "The theory of interaction rituals contains some gaps that need to be filled and some fuzzy concepts that need to be differentiated."&lt;ref&gt;Jörg Rössel and [[Randall Collins]], "Conflict theory and interaction rituals. The microfoundations of conflict theory." In: [[Jonathan H. Turner]] (ed.), ''Handbook of Sociological Theory''. New York: Springer, 2001, p. 527.&lt;/ref&gt; The idea is, that if finer distinctions are introduced, then the fuzziness or vagueness would be eliminated. 
*a book on youth culture describes [[ethnicity]] as "a fuzzy concept that overlaps at times with concepts of race, minority, nationality and tribe".&lt;ref&gt;Carol Jenkins, "Ethnicity, culture, drugs and sex". In: Peter Aggleton, Andrew Ball and Purnima Mane (eds.), "Sex, Drugs and Young People: International Perspectives." London: Routledge, 2006, p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt; In this case, part of the fuzziness consists in the inability to distinguish precisely between a concept and a different, but closely related concept.
*a book on sociological theory argues that the [[Critical Theory]] of domination faces the problem that "reality itself has become a rather meaningless, fuzzy concept."&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth Chaplin, ''Sociology and visual representation''. London: Routledge, 1994, p. 130.&lt;/ref&gt; The suggestion here is, that the variations in how theoretical concepts are applied have become so large, that the concepts could mean all kinds of things, and therefore are crucially vague (with the implication, that they are not useful any longer for that very reason).
*A history book states: "[[Sodomy]] was a vague and fuzzy concept in [[medieval]] and [[early modern Europe]], and was often associated with a variety of supposedly related moral and criminal offenses, including [[heresy]], [[witchcraft]], [[sedition]], and [[treason]]. St [[Thomas Acquinas]]... categorized sodomy with an assortment of sexual behaviours "from which generation [i.e. procreation] cannot follow".&lt;ref&gt;Stephen J. Lynch (ed.), ''Christopher Marlowe: Edward II, with related texts''. Indianapolis: Hackett Publishing Company, 2015, p. xix.&lt;/ref&gt; In this case, because a concept is defined by what it excludes, it remains somewhat vague what items of activity it would specifically ''include''.

===Mass media===
The main reason why the term "fuzzy concept" is now often used in describing human behaviour, is that human interaction has many characteristics which are difficult to quantify and measure precisely (although we know that they have magnitudes and proportions), among other things because they are interactive and reflexive (the observers and the observed mutually influence the meaning of events).&lt;ref&gt;[[Loïc Wacquant]], "The fuzzy logic of practical sense." in: [[Pierre Bourdieu]] and [[Loïc Wacquant]], ''An invitation to reflexive sociology''. London: Polity Press, 1992, chapter I section 4.&lt;/ref&gt; Those human characteristics can be usefully expressed only in an ''approximate'' way (see [[reflexivity (social theory)]]).&lt;ref&gt;Ph. Manning "Fuzzy Description: Discovery and Invention in Sociology". In: ''History of the Human Sciences'', Vol. 7, No. 1, 1994, pp. 117–23.[http://engagedscholarship.csuohio.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1049&amp;context=clsoc_crim_facpub]&lt;/ref&gt;

Newspaper stories frequently contain fuzzy concepts, which are readily understood and used, even although they are far from exact. Thus, many of the meanings which people ordinarily use to negotiate their way through life in reality turn out to be "fuzzy concepts". While people often do need to be exact about some things (e.g. money or time), many areas of their lives involve expressions which are far from exact.

Sometimes the term is also used in a [[pejorative]] sense. For example, a [[New York Times]] journalist wrote that [[Prince Sihanouk]] "seems unable to differentiate between friends and enemies, a disturbing trait since it suggests that he stands for nothing beyond the fuzzy concept of peace and prosperity in Cambodia".&lt;ref&gt;Philip Shenon, "Their prince is back: Cambodians are baffled." ''New York Times'', 6 June 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Applied social science===
The use of fuzzy logic in the social sciences and humanities has remained limited until recently. [[Lotfi Zadeh|Lotfi A. Zadeh]] said in a 1994 interview that:

{{Quotation|"I expected people in the social sciences – economics, psychology, philosophy, linguistics, politics, sociology, religion and numerous other areas to pick up on it. It's been somewhat of a mystery to me why even to this day, so few social scientists have discovered how useful it could be."&lt;ref&gt;Betty Blair, "Interview with Lotfi Zadeh, Creator of Fuzzy Logic". ''Azerbaijan International'', Winter 1994, pp. 46–47.[http://www.azer.com/aiweb/categories/magazine/24_folder/24_articles/24_fuzzylogic.html]&lt;/ref&gt; }}

Two decades later, after a digital [[information explosion]] due to the growing use of the internet and mobile phones worldwide,  fuzzy concepts and fuzzy logic are being widely applied in [[big data]] analysis of social, commercial and psychological phenomena. Many [[sociometry|sociometric]] and [[psychometrics|psychometric]] indicators are based partly on fuzzy concepts and fuzzy variables.

[[Jaakko Hintikka]] once claimed that "the logic of natural language we are in effect already using can serve as a "fuzzy logic" better than its trade name variant without any additional assumptions or constructions."&lt;ref&gt;[[Johan van Benthem (logician)|Johan van Benthem]] et al. (eds.), ''The age of alternative logics. Assessing philosophy of logic and mathematics today''. Dordrecht: Springer, 2006, p. 203.&lt;/ref&gt; That might help to explain why fuzzy logic has not been used much to formalize concepts in the "soft" social sciences. 

[[Lotfi Zadeh|Lotfi A. Zadeh]] rejected such an interpretation, on the ground that in many human endeavours as well as technologies it is highly important to define more exactly "to what extent" something is applicable or true, when it is known that its applicability can vary to some important extent among large populations. Reasoning which accepts and uses fuzzy concepts can be shown to be perfectly valid with the aid of fuzzy logic, because the degrees of applicability of a concept can be more precisely and efficiently defined with the aid of numerical notation.

Another possible explanation for the traditional lack of use of fuzzy logic by social scientists is simply that, beyond basic statistical analysis (using programs such as [[SPSS]] and [[Microsoft Excel|Excel]]) the mathematical knowledge of social scientists is often rather limited; they may not know how to formalize and code a fuzzy concept using the conventions of fuzzy logic. The standard software packages used provide only a limited capacity to analyze fuzzy data sets, if at all, and considerable skills are required. 

Yet Jaakko Hintikka may be correct, in the sense that it can be much more efficient to use natural language to denote a complex idea, than to formalize it in logical terms. The quest for formalization might introduce much more complexity, which is not wanted, and which detracts from communicating the relevant issue. Some concepts used in social science may be impossible to formalize exactly, even though they are quite useful and people understand their appropriate application quite well.

==Uncertainty==

Fuzzy concepts can generate [[uncertainty]] because they are imprecise (especially if they refer to a process in motion, or a process of transformation where something is "in the process of turning into something else"). In that case, they do not provide a clear orientation for action or decision-making ("what does X really mean, intend or imply?"); reducing fuzziness, perhaps by applying fuzzy logic,&lt;ref&gt;Kofi Kissi Dompere, ''Fuzziness and approximate reasoning; epistemics on uncertainty, expectation and risk in rational behaviour''. Berlin: Springer, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; might generate more certainty.

===Relevance===
However, this is not necessarily always so.&lt;ref&gt;Masao Mukaidono, ''Fuzzy logic for beginners''. Singapore: World Scientific Publishing, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; A concept, even although it is not fuzzy at all, and even though it is very exact, could equally well fail to capture the meaning of something adequately. That is, a concept can be very precise and exact, but not – or insufficiently – ''applicable'' or ''relevant'' in the situation to which it refers. In this sense, a definition can be "very precise", but "miss the point" altogether.

===Security===
A fuzzy concept may indeed provide ''more'' security, because it provides a meaning for something when an exact concept is unavailable – which is better than not being able to denote it at all. A concept such as [[God]], although not easily definable, for instance can provide security to the believer.&lt;ref&gt;[[Karen Armstrong]], ''The Case for God''. New York: Anchor, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Observer effect===
In physics, the [[observer effect (physics)|observer effect]] and [[Uncertainty principle|Heisenberg's uncertainty principle]]&lt;ref&gt;[[David Bohm]], ''Wholeness and the implicate order.'' London: Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul ARK paperback edition, 1983, p. 86f.&lt;/ref&gt; indicate that there is a physical limit to the amount of precision that is knowable, with regard to the movements of subatomic particles and waves. That is, features of physical reality exist, where we can know that they vary in magnitude, but of which we can never know or predict exactly how big or small the variations are. This insight suggests that, in some areas of our experience of the physical world, fuzziness is inevitable and can never be totally removed. Since the [[Universe|physical universe]] itself is incredibly large and diverse, it is not easy to imagine it, grasp it or describe it without using fuzzy concepts.

==Language==
Ordinary language, which uses symbolic conventions and associations which are often not logical, inherently contains many fuzzy concepts – "knowing what you mean" in this case depends partly on knowing the context (or being familiar with the way in which a term is normally used, or what it is associated with). 

This can be easily verified for instance by consulting a [[dictionary]], a [[thesaurus]] or an [[encyclopedia]] which show the multiple meanings of words, or by observing the behaviours involved in ordinary relationships which rely on mutually understood meanings (see also [[Imprecise language]]). [[Bertrand Russell]] regarded ordinary language (in contrast to logic) as intrinsically vague.&lt;ref&gt;Bertrand Russell. "Vagueness". In: ''Australasian Journal of Psychology and Philosophy'', Vol. 1, pp. 84–92, 1923. Reprinted in: ''Bertrand Russell Papers'', Vol. 9, pp. 147–54. Nadine Faulkner, "Russell and vagueness." ''Journal of Bertrand Russell Studies'', Summer 2003, pp. 43–63.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Implicature===
To communicate, receive or convey a [[message]], an individual somehow has to bridge his own intended meaning and the meanings which are understood by others, i.e., the message has to be conveyed in a way that it will be socially understood, preferably in the intended manner. Thus, people might state: "you have to say it in a way that I understand". Even if the message is clear and precise, it may nevertheless not be received in the way it was intended.

Bridging meanings may be done instinctively, habitually or unconsciously, but it usually involves a choice of terms, assumptions or [[symbols]] whose meanings are not completely fixed, but which depend among other things on how the receivers of the message respond to it, or the [[context (language use)|context]]. In this sense, meaning is often "negotiated" or "interactive" (or, more cynically, manipulated). This gives rise to many fuzzy concepts.

The semantic challenge of conveying meanings to an audience was explored in detail, and analyzed logically, by the British philosopher [[Paul Grice]] - using, among other things, the concept of [[implicature]].&lt;ref&gt;A critique of Grice is provided by Wayne A. Davis, ''Implicature: intention, convention, and principle in the failure of Gricean theory.'' Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1998. An example of a specific application of Gricean theory is: Penelope Brown &amp; Stephen C. Levinson, ''Politeness: some universals in language use''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1987.&lt;/ref&gt; Implicature refers to what is ''suggested'' by a message to the recipient, without being either explicitly expressed or logically entailed by its content. The suggestion could be very clear to the recipient (perhaps a sort of code), but it could also be vague or fuzzy.

===Paradoxes===
Even using ordinary [[set theory]] and [[Principle of bivalence|binary logic]] to reason something out, logicians have discovered that it is possible to generate statements which are logically speaking not completely true or imply a [[paradox]],&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Hughes &amp; George Brecht, ''Vicious Circles and Infinity. An anthology of Paradoxes.'' Penguin Books, 1978. Nicholas Rescher, ''Epistemological Studies''. Frankfurt: Ontos Verlag, 2009, chapter 3.&lt;/ref&gt; even although in other respects they conform to logical rules (see [[Russell's paradox]]). [[David Hilbert]] concluded that the existence of such logical paradoxes tells us "that we must develop a meta-mathematical analysis of the notions of proof and of the axiomatic method; their importance is methodological as well as epistemological".
&lt;ref&gt;Andrea Cantini, "Paradoxes and Contemporary Logic", ''Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' 30 April 2012.[https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/paradoxes-contemporary-logic/#RusCon]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Psychology==
Various different aspects of human experience commonly generate concepts with fuzzy characteristics.
===Human vs. Computer===
The formation of fuzzy concepts is partly due to the fact that the human brain does not operate like a computer (see also [[Chinese room]]).&lt;ref&gt;See further Radim Bělohlávek &amp; George J. Klir (eds.) ''Concepts and Fuzzy Logic''. MIT Press, 2011. [[John R. Searle]], "Minds, brains and programs". ''The behavioral and brain sciences'', Vol. 3, No. 3, 1980, pp. 417–457. [[Robert Epstein]], "The empty brain", ''Aeon'', 18 May 2016.[https://aeon.co/essays/your-brain-does-not-process-information-and-it-is-not-a-computer]&lt;/ref&gt;
*While ordinary computers use strict binary logic gates, the brain does not;  i.e., it is capable of making all kinds of neural associations according to all kinds of ordering principles (or fairly chaotically) in associative patterns which are not logical but nevertheless meaningful. For example, a work of art can be meaningful without being logical. A pattern can be regular, ordered and/or non-arbitrary, hence meaningful, without it being possible to describe it completely or exhaustively in formal-logical terms.
*Something can be meaningful although we cannot name it, or we might only be able to name it and nothing else.&lt;ref&gt;Harry Collins, ''Tacit &amp; explicit knowledge''. Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Human brains can also interpret the same phenomenon in several different but interacting frames of reference, at the same time, or in quick succession, without there necessarily being an explicit logical connection between the frames (see also [[framing effect]]).&lt;ref&gt;[[Amos Tversky]] and [[Daniel Kahneman]], "The framing of decisions and psychology of choice". ''Science'', Vol. 211, No. 4481, January 1981, pp. 453-458.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[fuzzy-trace theory]], partly inspired by [[Gestalt psychology]], human intuition is a non-arbitrary, reasonable and rational process of cognition; it literally "makes sense" (see also: [[Problem of multiple generality]]).&lt;ref&gt;C. J. Brainerd and V. F. Reyna, “Gist is the grist: fuzzy-trace theory and the new intuitionism”. ''Developmental Review'', Vol. 10, No. 1, March 1990, pp. 3-47, at p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Learning===
In part, fuzzy concepts arise also because [[learning]] or the growth of [[understanding]] involves a transition from a vague awareness, which cannot orient behaviour greatly, to clearer insight, which can orient behaviour. At the first encounter with an idea, the sense of the idea may be rather hazy. When more experience with the idea has occurred, a clearer and more precise grasp of the idea results, as well as a better understanding of how and when to use the idea (or not). 

In his study of [[implicit learning]], [[Arthur S. Reber]] affirms that there does not exist a very sharp boundary between the conscious and the unconscious, and "there are always going to be lots of fuzzy borderline cases of material that is marginally conscious and lots of elusive instances of functions and processes that seem to slip in and out of personal awareness".&lt;ref&gt;[[Arthur S. Reber]], ''Implicit learning and tacit knowledge. An essay on the cognitive unconscious''. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1993, pp. 137-138.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Thus, an inevitable component of fuzziness exists and persists in human consciousness, because of continual variation of gradations in awareness, along a continuum from the [[conscious]], the [[preconscious]], and the [[subconscious]] to the [[unconscious mind|unconscious]]. The hypnotherapist [[Milton H. Erickson]] noted likewise that the conscious mind and the unconscious normally interact.&lt;ref&gt;Ronald A. Havens (ed.), ''The wisdom of Milton H. Erickson, Volume II: human behavior &amp; psychotherapy.'' New York: Irvington Publishers, 1992, chapter 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Limits===
Some psychologists and logicians argue that fuzzy concepts are a necessary consequence of the reality that any kind of distinction we might like to draw has ''limits of application''. At a certain level of generality, a distinction works fine. But if we pursued its application in a very exact and [[rigorous]] manner, or overextend its application, it appears that the distinction simply does not apply in some areas or contexts, or that we cannot fully specify how it should be drawn. An [[analogy]] might be, that zooming a [[telescope]], [[camera]], or [[microscope]] in and out, reveals that a pattern which is sharply focused at a certain distance becomes blurry at another distance, or disappears altogether.

===Complexity===
Faced with any large, complex and continually changing phenomenon, any short statement made about that phenomenon is likely to be "fuzzy", i.e., it is meaningful, but – strictly speaking – incorrect and imprecise.&lt;ref&gt;A. Cornelius Benjamin, "Science and vagueness". In: ''Philosophy of science'', Vol. 6 No. 4, 1939, pp. 422-431.&lt;/ref&gt; It will not really do full justice to the reality of what is happening with the phenomenon. A correct, precise statement would require a lot of elaborations and qualifiers. Nevertheless, the "fuzzy" description turns out to be a useful shorthand that saves a lot of time in communicating what is going on ("you know what I mean").

===Cognition===
In [[psychophysics]], it was discovered that the perceptual distinctions we draw in the mind are often more definite than they are in the real world. Thus, the brain actually tends to "sharpen up" or "enhance" our perceptions of differences in the external world. 
*Between black and white, we are able to detect only a limited number of shades of gray, or colour gradations (there are "[[Absolute threshold|detection thresholds]]").&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth Knoblauch, "Color Vision", in: ''Steven's handbook of experimental psychology, Vol 1: sensation and perception'' (3rd ed.). New York: John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2002, p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Motion blur]] refers to the loss of detail when a person looks at a fast-moving object, or is moving fast while the eyes are focused on something stationary. In a movie reel, the human eye can detect a sequence of up to 10 or 12 still images per second. At around 18 to 26 frames per second, the brain will "see" the sequence of individual images as a moving scene.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Tarantola, "Why Frame Rate Matters". Gizmodo.com, 14 January 2015.[https://gizmodo.com/why-frame-rate-matters-1675153198]&lt;/ref&gt;

If there are more gradations and transitions in reality, than our conceptual or perceptual distinctions can capture, then it could be argued that how those distinctions will actually apply, must ''necessarily'' become vaguer at some point.

===Novelty===
In interacting with the external world, the human mind may often encounter new, or partly ''new phenomena or relationships'' which cannot (yet) be sharply defined given the background knowledge available, and by known distinctions, associations or generalizations.

{{Quotation|"Crisis management plans cannot be put 'on the fly' after the crisis occurs. At the outset, information is often [[vague]], even contradictory. Events move so quickly that decision makers experience a sense of loss of control. Often denial sets in, and managers unintentionally cut off information flow about the situation" - [[L. Paul Bremer]].&lt;ref&gt;[[L. Paul Bremer]], "Corporate governance and crisis management", in: ''Directors &amp; Boards'', Winter 2002&lt;/ref&gt; }}

===Chaos===
It also can be argued that fuzzy concepts are generated by a certain sort of [[lifestyle (sociology)|lifestyle]] or way of working which evades definite distinctions, makes them impossible or inoperable, or which is in some way chaotic. To obtain concepts which are not fuzzy, it must be possible to [[Test method|test]] out their application in some way. But in the absence of any relevant clear distinctions, lacking an orderly environment, or when everything is "in a state of [[flux]]" or in transition, it may not be possible to do so, so that the amount of fuzziness increases.

==Everyday occurrence==

Fuzzy concepts often play a role in the creative process of forming new concepts to understand something. In the most primitive sense, this can be observed in infants who, through practical experience, learn to identify, distinguish and generalise the correct application of a concept, and relate it to other concepts.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jean Piaget]] &amp; [[Bärbel Inhelder]], ''The Growth of Logical Thinking from Childhood to Adolescence''. New York: Basic Books, 1958; Philip J. Kelman &amp; Martha E. Arterberry, ''The cradle of knowledge: development of perception in infancy''. Cambridge, Mass.: The MIT Press, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, fuzzy concepts may also occur in scientific, journalistic, programming and philosophical activity, when a thinker is in the process of clarifying and defining a newly emerging concept which is based on distinctions which, for one reason or another, cannot (yet) be more exactly specified or validated. Fuzzy concepts are often used to denote [[Complexity|complex]] phenomena, or to describe something which is developing and changing, which might involve shedding some old meanings and acquiring new ones.

===Areas===
*In [[meteorology]], where changes and effects of complex interactions in the atmosphere are studied, the weather reports often use fuzzy expressions indicating a broad trend, likelihood or level. The main reason is that the forecast can rarely be totally exact for any given location.
*In [[biology]], protein complexes with multiple structural forms are called [[fuzzy complex]]es. The different conformations can result in different, even opposite functions. The conformational ensemble is modulated by the environmental conditions. Post-translational modifications or alternative splicing can also impact the ensemble and thereby the affinity or specificity of interactions. [[Genetic fuzzy systems]] use [[algorithms]] or [[genetic programming]] which simulate natural evolutionary processes, in order to understand their structures and parameters.
*In [[medical diagnosis]], the assessment of what the symptoms of a patient are often cannot be very exactly specified, since there are many possible qualitative and quantitative gradations in severity, incidence or frequency that could occur.&lt;ref&gt;Rudolf Seising, "On the absence of strict boundaries — Vagueness, haziness, and fuzziness in philosophy, science, and medicine". ''Applied Soft Computing'', Vol 8, 2008, pp. 1232–1242, at p. 1235.&lt;/ref&gt; Different symptoms may also overlap to some extent. These gradations can be difficult to measure, it may cost a lot of time and money, and so the medical professionals might use approximate "fuzzy" categories in their judgement of a medical condition or a patient's condition. Although it may not be exact, the diagnosis is often useful enough for treatment purposes. Fuzzy logic is increasingly employed in diagnostic and medical equipment capable of measuring gradations of a condition.&lt;ref&gt;Kazem Sadegh-Zadeh "The Fuzzy Revolution: Goodbye to the Aristotelian Weltanschauung". In: ''Artificial Intelligence in Medicine'', 21, 2001, pp. 18–19.[http://www.iiia.csic.es/~puyol/SEIAD2001/publicacions/sadegh.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;
*In [[information services]] fuzzy concepts are frequently encountered because a customer or client asks a question about something which could be interpreted in different ways, or, a document is transmitted of a type or meaning which cannot be easily allocated to a known type or category, or to a known procedure. It might take considerable inquiry to "place" the information, or establish in what framework it should be understood.
*In [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]] which aims to study the structure of subjective experience without preconceptions,&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Priest, Theories of the mind. London: Penguin Books, 1991, p. 183.&lt;/ref&gt; an important insight is that how someone experiences something can be influenced ''both'' by the influence of the thing being experienced itself, but ''also'' by how the person responds to it.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Hammond, Jane Howarth and Russell Keat, ''Understanding Phenomenology''. Oxford: Blackwell, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the actual experience the person has, is shaped by an "interactive object-subject relationship". To describe this experience, fuzzy categories are often necessary, since it is often impossible to predict or describe with great exactitude what the interaction will be, and how it is experienced.
*In [[translation]] work, fuzzy concepts are analyzed for the purpose of good translation. A concept in one language may not have quite the same meaning or significance in another language, or it may not be feasible to translate it literally, or at all.&lt;ref&gt;Cornelia Griebel, "Fuzzy concepts in translators’ minds". In: Valérie Dullion, ''Between specialised texts and institutional contexts – competence and choice in legal translation''. Amsterdam:  John Benjamins Publishing Company, 2017. (Special issue of ''Translation and Translanguaging in Multilingual Contexts'', Vol. 3, No. 1, 2017).&lt;/ref&gt; Some languages have concepts which do not exist in another language, raising the problem of how one would most easily render their meaning. In [[computer-assisted translation]], a technique called [[Fuzzy matching (computer-assisted translation)|fuzzy matching]] is used to find the most likely translation of a piece of text, using previous translated texts as a basis.
*In [[hypnotherapy]], fuzzy language is deliberately used for the purpose of trance induction. Hypnotic suggestions are often couched in a somewhat vague, general or ambiguous language requiring interpretation by the subject. The intention is to distract and shift the conscious awareness of the subject away from external reality to her own internal state. In response to the somewhat confusing signals she gets, the awareness of the subject spontaneously tends to withdraw inward, in search of understanding or escape.&lt;ref&gt;Ronald A. Havens (ed.), ''The wisdom of Milton H.  Erickson, Volume I: hypnosis and hypnotherapy''. New York: Irvington Publishers, 1992, p. 106. Joseph O'Connor &amp; John Seymour (ed.), ''Introducing neuro-linguistic programming''. London: Thorsons, 1995, p. 116f.&lt;/ref&gt;
*In [[business]] and [[economics]], it was discovered that "we are guided less by a correct exact knowledge of our self-interest than by a socially learned, evolved, intuitive grasp derived from mental shortcuts ([[Framing effect (psychology)|frames]], reference points, envy, addiction, temptation, fairness)".&lt;ref&gt;Francese Trillas, "Fuzzy logic and modern economics." In:  Rudolf Seising, Enric Trillas &amp; [[Janusz Kacprzyk]] (eds.), ''Towards the future of fuzzy logic''. Basel: Springer International Publishing, 2015, p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, economic preferences are often ''fuzzy'' preferences, a highly important point for suppliers of products and services. Fuzzy set empirical methodologies are increasingly used by economic analysts to analyze the extent to which members of a population belong to a specific market category, because that can make a big difference to business results.
*In [[sexology]],  sex and gender are conceptualized by gender pluralists as a spectrum or continuum, or a set of scaled characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;Surya Monro, ‘’Bisexuality’’. Houndmills, Basingstoke: Palgrave Macmillan, 2015, p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the idea that people are either heterosexual [[men]], heterosexual [[women]], [[gay]], [[lesbian]], [[bisexual]] or [[transsexual]] is far too simplistic; [[gender identity]] is a matter of degree, a graded concept, which for that very reason is a ''fuzzy'' concept with unsharp boundaries. For example, somebody who is "mainly" heterosexual, may occasionally have had non-heterosexual contacts, without this warranting a definite "bisexual" label. A great variety of sexual orientations are possible and can co-exist. In the course of history, typical male or female gender roles and gender characteristics can also gradually change, so that the extent to which they express "masculine" or "feminine" traits is, at any time, a matter of degree, i.e. fuzzy. 
*In [[politics]], it can be highly important and problematic how exactly a conceptual distinction is drawn, or indeed whether a distinction is drawn at all; distinctions used in administration may be deliberately sharpened, or kept fuzzy, due to some political motive or [[Political power|power]] relationship.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bart Kosko]], "Yes, Candidates, There Is a Fuzzy Math". ''New York Times'', 7 November 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; Politicians may be deliberately vague about some things, and very clear and explicit about others; if there is information that proves their case, they become very precise, but if the information doesn't prove their case, they become vague or say nothing. 
*In [[statistical]] research, it is an aim to measure the magnitudes of phenomena. For this purpose, phenomena have to be grouped and categorized, so that distinct and discrete counting units can be defined. It must be possible to allocate all observations to mutually exclusive categories, so that they are properly quantifiable. Survey observations do not spontaneously transform themselves into countable data; they have to be identified, categorized and classified in such a way, that identical observations can be grouped together, and that observations are not counted twice or more.&lt;ref&gt;Russel Gordon &amp; David Bendien, "Standard classifications". ''New Zealand Statistics Review'', September 1993, p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; A well-designed questionnaire ensures that the questions are interpreted in the same way by all respondents, and that the respondents are really able to answer them within the formats provided. Again, for this purpose, it is a requirement that the concepts being used are exactly and comprehensibly defined for all concerned, and not fuzzy.&lt;ref&gt;Paul C. Bauer et al., "Vague concepts in survey questions. A general problem illustrated with the left-right scale." SSRN Electronic Journal, April 2014.[http://pablobarbera.com/static/vague-concepts.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; There could be a margin of measurement error, but the amount of error must be kept within tolerable limits, and preferably its magnitude should be known.
*In [[theology]] an attempt is made to define more precisely the meaning of [[spirtuality|spiritual]] concepts, which refer to how human beings construct the meaning of human existence, and, often, the relationship people have with a [[supernatural]] world. Many spiritual concepts and beliefs are fuzzy, to the extent that, although abstract, they often have a highly personalized meaning, or involve personal interpretation of a type that is not easy to define in a cut-and-dried way. A similar situation occurs in [[psychotherapy]]. The Dutch theologian Kees de Groot has explored the imprecise notion that [[psychotherapy]] is like an "implicit [[religion]]", defined as a "fuzzy concept" (it all depends on what one means by "psychotherapy" and "religion").&lt;ref&gt;C.N. de Groot, "Sociology of religion looks at psychotherapy." ''Recherches sociologiques'' (Louvain-la-Neuve, Belgium), Vol. 29, No. 2, 1998, pp. 3–17 at p. 4.[http://arno.uvt.nl/show.cgi?fid=76988]&lt;/ref&gt; The philosopher of spirituality [[Ken Wilber]] argued that "nothing is 100% right or wrong", things merely "vary in their degree of incompleteness and dysfunction"; no one and nothing is 100% good or evil, each just varies "in their degree of ignorance and disconnection". This insight suggests, that ''all'' human valuations can be considered as graded concepts, where each qualitative judgement has at least implicitly a sense of quantitative proportion attached to it.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Manson, "The rise and fall of Ken Wilber", markmanson.net, 4 June 2012.[https://markmanson.net/ken-wilber]&lt;/ref&gt;
*In the [[legal system]], it is essential that rules are interpreted and applied in a standard way, so that the same sorts of cases and the same sorts of circumstances are treated equally. Otherwise one would be accused of arbitrariness,&lt;ref&gt;That is, in applying rules, the rules are not consistently followed, and the pattern of their application therefore does not follow rules.&lt;/ref&gt; which would not serve the interests of justice. Consequently, lawmakers aim to devise definitions and categories which are sufficiently precise, so that they are not open to different interpretations. For this purpose, it is critically important to remove fuzziness, and differences of interpretation are typically resolved through a court ruling based on evidence. Alternatively, some other procedure is devised which permits the correct distinction to be discovered and made.&lt;ref&gt;For more information see e.g. Ralf Posche, "Ambiguity And Vagueness In Legal Interpretation", in: Lawrence M. Solan &amp; Peter M. Tiersma (eds.), ''The Oxford Handbook of Language and Law''. Oxford University Press, 2012, pp. 128-144.&lt;/ref&gt;
*In [[Business administration|administration]], [[Archive|archiving]] and [[accounting]], fuzziness problems in interpretation and boundary problems can arise, because it is not clear to what category exactly a case, item, document, transaction or piece of data belongs. In principle, each case, event or item must be allocated to the correct category in a procedure, but it may be, that it is difficult to make the appropriate or relevant distinctions.&lt;ref&gt;David Henry, "Fuzzy Numbers', ''Bloomberg Businessweek'', 3 October 2004.[http://www.businessweek.com/stories/2004-10-03/fuzzy-numbers]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Generalities===
It could be argued that many concepts used fairly universally in daily life (e.g. "love", "God", "health",  "social", "tolerance" etc.) are ''inherently or intrinsically'' fuzzy concepts, to the extent that their meaning can never be completely and exactly specified with logical operators or objective terms, and can have multiple interpretations, which are at least in part purely subjective. Yet despite this limitation, such concepts are not meaningless. People keep using the concepts, even if they are difficult to define precisely.

===Multiple meanings===
It may also be possible to specify one personal meaning for the concept, without however placing restrictions on a different use of the concept in other contexts (as when, for example, one says "this is what I mean by X" in contrast to other possible meanings). In ordinary speech, concepts may sometimes also be uttered purely randomly; for example a child may repeat the same idea in completely unrelated contexts, or an [[Expletive attributive|expletive]] term may be uttered arbitrarily. A feeling or sense is conveyed, without it being fully clear what it is about.

[[Happiness#definitions|Happiness]] may be an example of a word with variable meanings depending on context.

===Ambiguities===
Fuzzy concepts can be used deliberately to create [[ambiguity]] and [[vagueness]], as an evasive tactic, or to bridge what would otherwise be immediately recognized as a [[contradiction]] of terms. They might be used to indicate that there is definitely a connection between two things, without giving a complete specification of what the connection is, for some or other reason. This could be due to a failure or refusal to be more precise. But it could also could be a prologue to a more exact formulation of a concept, or to a better understanding of it.

==Efficiency==

Fuzzy concepts can be used as a practical method to describe something of which a complete description would be an unmanageably large undertaking, or very time-consuming; thus, a simplified indication of what is at issue is regarded as sufficient, although it is not exact.

===Popper===
There is also such a thing as an "economy of distinctions", meaning that it is not helpful or efficient to use more detailed definitions than are really necessary for a given purpose. In this sense, [[Karl Popper]] rejected [[pedant]]ry and commented that:

{{Quotation| "...it is always undesirable to make an effort to increase precision for its own sake — especially linguistic precision — since this usually leads to loss of clarity, and to a waste of time and effort on preliminaries which often turn out to be useless, because they are bypassed by the real advance of the subject: one should never try to be more precise than the problem situation demands. I might perhaps state my position as follows. Every increase in clarity is of intellectual value in itself; an increase in precision or exactness has only a pragmatic value as a means to some definite end..."&lt;ref&gt;Karl Popper, ''Unended quest: an intellectual autobiography''. London: Routledge, 2002, p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; }}

The provision of "too many details" could be disorienting and confusing, instead of being enlightening, while a fuzzy term might be sufficient to provide an orientation. The reason for using fuzzy concepts can therefore be purely pragmatic, if it is not feasible or desirable (for practical purposes) to provide "all the details" about the meaning of a shared symbol or sign. Thus people might say "I realize this is not exact, but you know what I mean" – they assume practically that stating all the details is not required for the purpose of the communication.

===Fuzzy logic gambit===
[[Lotfi Zadeh|Lotfi A. Zadeh]] picked up this point, and drew attention to a "major misunderstanding" about applying fuzzy logic. It is true that the basic aim of fuzzy logic is to make what is imprecise more precise. Yet in many cases, fuzzy logic is used paradoxically to "imprecisiate what is precise", meaning that there is a deliberate tolerance for imprecision for the sake of simplicity of procedure and economy of expression. 

In such uses, there is a tolerance for imprecision, because making ideas more precise would be unnecessary and costly, while "imprecisiation reduces cost and enhances tractability" (tractability means "being easy to manage or operationalize"). Zadeh calls this approach the "Fuzzy Logic Gambit" (a gambit means giving up something now, to achieve a better position later).

In the Fuzzy Logic Gambit, "what is sacrificed is precision in [quantitative] value, but not precision in meaning", and more concretely, "imprecisiation in value is followed by precisiation in meaning". Zadeh cited as example [[Fuzzy control system|Takeshi Yamakawa]]'s programming for an [[inverted pendulum]], where differential equations are replaced by fuzzy if-then rules in which words are used in place of numbers.&lt;ref&gt;[[Lotfi Zadeh|Lotfi A. Zadeh]], "What is fuzzy logic?". ''IFSA Newsletter'' (International Fuzzy Systems Association), Vol. 10, No. 1, March 2013. Takeshi Yamakawa "Stabilization of an Inverted Pendulum by a High-speed Fuzzy Logic Controller Hardware System". ''Fuzzy Sets and Systems'', Vol.32, pp. 161–180, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fuzzy vs. Boolean===
Common use of this sort of approach, particularly in programming, has led some logicians to regard fuzzy logic merely as an extension of [[Boolean logic]] (a [[two-valued logic]] or binary logic is simply replaced with a [[many-valued logic]]). 

However, Boolean concepts have a logical structure which differs from fuzzy concepts. An important feature in Boolean logic is, that an element of a set can also belong to any number of other sets; even so, the element ''either'' does, ''or'' does not belong to a set (or sets). By contrast, whether an element belongs to a fuzzy set is a matter of degree, and not always a definite yes-or-no question.

All the same, the Greek mathematician Costas Drossos suggests in various papers that, using a "non-standard" mathematical approach, we could also construct fuzzy sets with Boolean characteristics and Boolean sets with fuzzy characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;See e.g. C. A. Drossos, "Foundations of fuzzy sets: A nonstandard approach". ''Fuzzy Sets and Systems'', Volume 37, Issue 3, 28 September 1990, pp. 287-307.&lt;/ref&gt; This would imply, that in practice the boundary between fuzzy sets and Boolean sets is itself fuzzy, rather than absolute. For a simplified example, we might be able to state, that a concept ''X'' is definitely applicable to a finite set of phenomena, and definitely not applicable to all other phenomena. Yet, within the finite set of relevant items, ''X'' might be ''fully'' applicable to one subset of the included phenomena, while it is applicable only “to some varying extent or degree” to another subset of phenomena which are also included in the set.

==Clarifying methods==
In [[mathematical logic]], [[computer programming]], [[philosophy]] and [[linguistics]] fuzzy concepts can be analyzed and defined more accurately or comprehensively, by describing or modelling the concepts using the terms of [[fuzzy logic]] or other [[substructural logic]]s. More generally, clarification techniques can be used such as:

*1. Contextualizing the concept by defining the setting or situation in which the concept is used, or how it is used appropriately  ([[Context (language use)|context]]).
*2. Identifying the [[intention]], [[purpose]], aim or goal associated with the concept ([[teleology]] and [[design]]).
*3. Comparing and contrasting the concept with related ideas in the present or the past ([[comparative]] and [[comparative research]]).
*4. Creating a [[Conceptual model|model]], likeness, [[analogy]], [[metaphor]], [[prototype]] or [[narrative]] which shows what the concept is about or how it is applied ([[isomorphism]] or [[simulation]]).
*5. ''Probing the [[Presupposition|assumptions]]'' on which a concept is based, or which are associated with its use ([[critical thought]], [[tacit assumption]]).
*6. ''[[Map (mathematics)|Map]]ping or [[graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]]ing'' the applications of the concept using some basic [[parameters]], or using some diagrams or flow charts to understand the relationships between elements involved ([[Visualization (graphics)|visualization]] and [[concept map]]).&lt;ref&gt;Guy W. Mineau et al. (eds.), ''Conceptual graphs for knowledge representation''. Berlin: Springer, 1993. Tru Hoang Cao, ''Conceptual graphs and fuzzy logic''. Berlin: Springer, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;
*7. Examining ‘’how likely’’ it is that the concept applies, statistically or intuitively ([[probability theory]]).
*8. Specifying relevant ''conditions'' to which the concept applies, as a procedure ([[computer programming]], [[formal concept analysis]]).
*9. [[Abstract and concrete|Concretizing]] the concept – finding specific examples, illustrations, details or cases to which it applies ([[Exemplification theory|exemplar]], [[exemplification]]).
*10. ''Reducing or restating'' fuzzy concepts in terms which are simpler or similar, and which are not fuzzy or less fuzzy ([[Computer algebra#Simplification|simplification]], [[dimensionality reduction]], [[plain language]], [[KISS principle]] or [[concision]]).
*11. Trying out a concept, by using it in interactions, practical work or in communication, and assessing the feedback to understand how the boundaries and distinctions of the concept are being drawn ([[trial and error]] or [[pilot experiment]]). 
*12. Engaging in a structured [[dialogue]] or repeated [[discussion]], to exchange ideas about how to get specific about what it means and how to clear it up ([[Scrum (software development)|scrum method]]).
*13. Allocating different applications of the concept to different but related ''sets'' ([[Boolean logic]]).
*14. Identifying ''operational rules'' defining the use of the concept, which can be stated in a language and which cover all or most cases ([[material conditional]]).
*15. [[Categorization|Classifying, categorizing, grouping]], or inventorizing all or most cases or uses to which the concept applies ([[Taxonomy (general)|taxonomy]], [[cluster analysis]] and [[typology (statistics)|typology]]).
[[File:Operationalization of Free and Fair Judiciary.png|thumb|400px|An [[operationalization]] diagram, one method of clarifing fuzzy concepts.]]
*16. Applying a ''[[meta-language]]'' which includes fuzzy concepts in a more inclusive categorical system which is not fuzzy ([[meta]]).
*17. Creating a ''[[Measurement|measure]] or [[Scale (social sciences)|scale]]'' of the degree to which the concept applies ([[metrology]]).
*18. Examining the ''distribution patterns'' or distributional frequency of (possibly different) uses of the concept ([[statistics]]).
*19. Specifying a series of [[logical operators]] or inferential system which captures all or most cases to which the concept applies ([[algorithm]]).
*20. ''Relating'' the fuzzy concept to other concepts which are not fuzzy or less fuzzy, or simply by ''replacing'' the fuzzy concept altogether with another, alternative concept which is not fuzzy yet "works the same way" ([[Proxy (statistics)|proxy]])
*21. Engaging in [[meditation]], or taking the proverbial "run around the block" to clarify the mind, and thus improve precision of thought about the definitional issue ([[self-care]]).

In this way, we can obtain a more exact understanding of the meaning and use of a fuzzy concept, and possibly decrease the amount of fuzziness. It may not be possible to specify all the possible meanings or applications of a concept completely and exhaustively, but if it is possible to capture the majority of them, statistically or otherwise, this may be useful enough for practical purposes.

==Defuzzification==
{{main|Defuzzification}}
A process of [[defuzzification]] is said to occur, when fuzzy concepts can be logically described in terms of [[fuzzy set]]s, or the relationships between fuzzy sets, which makes it possible to define variations in the meaning or applicability of concepts as ''quantities''. Effectively, qualitative differences are in that case described more precisely as quantitative variations, or quantitative variability. Assigning a numerical value then denotes the magnitude of variation along a scale from zero to one.

The difficulty that can occur in judging the fuzziness of a concept can be illustrated with the question ''"Is this one of those?"''. If it is not possible to clearly answer this question, that could be because "this" (the object) is itself fuzzy and evades definition, or because "one of those" (the concept of the object) is fuzzy and inadequately defined.

Thus, the source of fuzziness may be in (1) the nature of the reality being dealt with, (2) the concepts used to interpret it, or (3) the way in which the two are being related by a person.&lt;ref&gt;cf. Timothy Williamson, ''Vagueness''. London: Routledge, 1996, p. 258.&lt;/ref&gt; It may be that the personal meanings which people attach to something are quite clear to the persons themselves, but that it is not possible to communicate those meanings to others except as fuzzy concepts.

[[File:GanttChartAnatomy.svg|right|thumb|A Gantt chart showing three kinds of schedule dependencies (in red) and percent complete indications.]]
A '''Gantt chart''' is a type of [[bar chart]] that illustrates a [[schedule (project management)|project schedule]], named after its inventor, [[Henry Gantt]] (1861–1919), who designed such a chart around the years 1910–1915.{{sfn|Gantt|1910}}{{sfn|Morris|1997|p=7}} Modern Gantt charts also show the [[Dependency (project management)|dependency]] relationships between activities and current schedule status.

== Definition ==
A Gantt chart is a type of bar chart{{sfn|Klein|1999|p=49}}{{sfn|Richman|2002|pp=97, 117, 276}} that illustrates a project schedule.&lt;ref name="Kumar 2005 pp. 13–21"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kumar |first=Pankaja Pradeep |title=Effective Use of Gantt Chart for Managing Large Scale Projects |journal=Cost Engineering |publisher=American Association of Cost Engineers |publication-place=Morgantown, WV |volume=47 |issue=7 |year=2005 |oclc=209778284 |issn=0274-9696 |pages=13–21}}&lt;/ref&gt; This chart lists the tasks to be performed on the vertical axis, and time intervals on the horizontal axis.{{sfn|Klein|1999|p=49}}{{sfn|Richman|2002|pp=117, 276}} The width of the horizontal bars in the graph shows the duration of each activity.{{sfn|Richman|2002|pp=117, 276}}{{sfn|Selig|2008|p=235}} Gantt charts illustrate the start and finish dates of the terminal elements and summary elements of a [[project]]. Terminal elements and summary elements constitute the [[work breakdown structure]] of the project. Modern Gantt charts also show the [[Dependency (project management)|dependency]] (i.e., precedence network) relationships between activities. Gantt charts can be used to show current schedule status using percent-complete shadings and a vertical "TODAY" line as shown here.

Gantt charts are sometimes equated with bar charts.{{sfn|Selig|2008|p=235}}{{sfn|Flouris|Lock|2012|p=236|loc=Chapter 12}}

Gantt charts are usually created initially using an ''early start time approach'', where each task is scheduled to start immediately when its prerequisites are complete. This method maximizes the [[Float (project management)|float time]] available for all tasks.{{sfn|Klein|1999|p=49}}

== Historical development ==

Although now regarded as a common charting technique, Gantt charts were considered revolutionary when first introduced.{{sfn|Wilson|2003}} The first known tool of this type was developed in 1896 by [[Karol Adamiecki]], who called it a ''harmonogram''.{{sfn|Marsh|1974|p=32}} Adamiecki did not publish his chart until 1931, however, and only in Polish, which limited both its adoption and recognition of his authorship.

In 1912, {{ill|Hermann Schürch|de}} published what would be considered Gantt charts while discussing a construction project. It appears that Schürch's charts were not notable but rather routine in Germany at the time they were published.{{sfn|Weaver|2012a|pp=5–6}}{{sfn|Weaver|2012b|pp=4–6}}{{sfn|Weaver|2017|pp=6–7}} The prior development leading to Schürch's work is unknown.{{sfn|Weaver|2017|p=7}} Unlike later Gantt charts, Schürch's charts did not display interdependencies, leaving them to be inferred by the reader. These were also static representations of a planned schedule.{{sfn|Weaver|2017|p=6}}

The chart is named after [[Henry Gantt]] (1861–1919), who designed his chart around the years 1910–1915.{{sfn|Gantt|1910}}{{sfn|Morris|1997|p=7}}

One of the first major applications of Gantt charts was by the United States during [[World War I]], at the instigation of [[William Crozier (artillerist)|General William Crozier]].{{sfn|Clark|1922}}

The earliest Gantt charts were drawn on paper and therefore had to be redrawn entirely in order to adjust to schedule changes. For many years, project managers used pieces of paper or blocks for Gantt chart bars so they could be adjusted as needed.{{sfn|Flouris|Lock|2012|p=281|loc=Chapter 14}} Gantt's collaborator, [[Walter Polakov]] introduced Gantt charts to the [[Soviet Union]] in 1929 when he was working for the [[Supreme Soviet of the National Economy]]. They were used in developing the [[First Five Year Plan]], supplying Russian translations to explain their use.&lt;ref name ="Kelly"&gt;Kelly, D. J. (2004) "[https://ro.uow.edu.au/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1021&amp;context=artspapers Marxist Manager Amidst the Progressives: Walter N. Polakov and the Taylor Society]", ''Journal of Industrial History'', 6(2), November 2004, 61-75&lt;/ref&gt;.&lt;ref name="Olson"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Olson |first1=Richard G. |title=Scientism and Technocracy in the Twentieth Century: The Legacy of Scientific Management |date=2015 |publisher=Lexington Books |isbn=9781498525718 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=BFzpCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA63&amp;lpg=PA63&amp;dq=Technocracy+Russia+Polakov&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=MFPxEkfYYf&amp;sig=t0eKfWS2S3OJOOjPm9cHhehimb8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiW_57gsNbdAhUkDMAKHTbSDRAQ6AEwA3oECAgQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Technocracy%20Russia%20Polakov&amp;f=false |accessdate=25 September 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1980s, personal computers allowed widespread creation of complex and elaborate Gantt charts. The first desktop applications were intended mainly for project managers and project schedulers. With the advent of the Internet and increased collaboration over networks at the end of the 1990s, Gantt charts became a common feature of web-based applications, including collaborative [[groupware]].{{cn|date=January 2018}} By 2012, almost all Gantt charts were made by software which can easily adjust to schedule changes.{{sfn|Flouris|Lock|2012|p=281|loc=Chapter 14}}

In 1999, Gantt charts were identified as "one of the most widely used management tools for project scheduling and control".{{sfn|Klein|1999|p=49}}

== Example ==
In the following table there are seven tasks, labeled ''a'' through ''g''. Some tasks can be done concurrently (''a'' and ''b'') while others cannot be done until their predecessor task is complete (''c'' and ''d'' cannot begin until ''a'' is complete). Additionally, each task has three time estimates: the optimistic time estimate (''O''), the most likely or normal time estimate (''M''), and the pessimistic time estimate (''P''). The expected time (''T&lt;sub&gt;E&lt;/sub&gt;'') is estimated using the [[Beta distribution#Project management: task cost and schedule modeling|beta probability distribution]] for the time estimates, using the formula (''O''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;4''M''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''P'')&amp;nbsp;÷&amp;nbsp;6.

Once this step is complete, one can draw a Gantt chart or a network diagram.

:[[File:pert example gantt chart.gif|frame|none|A Gantt chart created using [[Microsoft Project]] (MSP).  Note (1) the [[critical path method|critical path]] is in red, (2) the [[Float (project management)|slack]] is the black lines connected to non-critical activities, (3) since Saturday and Sunday are not work days and are thus excluded from the schedule, some bars on the Gantt chart are longer if they cut through a weekend.]]

== Progress Gantt charts ==
In a progress Gantt chart, tasks are shaded in proportion to the degree of their completion: a task that is 60% complete would be 60% shaded, starting from the left. A vertical line is drawn at the time index when the progress Gantt chart is created, and this line can then be compared with shaded tasks. If everything is on schedule, all task portions left of the line will be shaded, and all task portions right of the line will not be shaded. This provides a visual representation of how the project and its tasks are ahead or behind schedule.{{sfn|Klein|1999|pp=56–57}}

== Linked Gantt charts ==
''Linked Gantt charts'' contain lines indicating the dependencies between tasks. However, linked Gantt charts quickly become cluttered in all but the simplest cases. [[Critical path network diagram]]s are superior to visually communicate the relationships between tasks.{{sfn|Flouris|Lock|2012|p=239|loc=Chapter 12}} However, Gantt charts are often preferred over network diagrams because Gantt charts are easily interpreted without training, whereas critical path diagrams require training to interpret.{{sfn|Flouris|Lock|2012|p=236|loc=Chapter 12}} Gantt chart software typically provides mechanisms to link task dependencies, although this data may or may not be visually represented.{{sfn|Klein|1999|p=49}} Gantt charts and network diagrams are often used for the same project, both being generated from the same data by a software application.{{sfn|Klein|1999|p=49}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8624">'''General set theory (GST)''' is [[George Boolos]]'s (1998) name for a fragment of the [[axiomatic set theory]] [[Zermelo set theory|Z]]. GST is sufficient for all mathematics not requiring [[infinite set]]s, and is the weakest known set theory whose [[theorem]]s include the [[Peano axioms]].

==Ontology==
The ontology of GST is identical to that of [[ZFC]], and hence is thoroughly canonical. GST features a single [[primitive notion|primitive]] [[ontology|ontological]] notion, that of [[set (mathematics)|set]], and a single ontological assumption, namely that all individuals in the [[universe of discourse]] (hence all [[mathematical object]]s) are sets. There is a single [[primitive notion|primitive]] [[binary relation]], [[element (mathematics)|set membership]]; that set ''a'' is a member of set ''b'' is written ''a''∈''b'' (usually read "''a'' is an [[element (mathematics)|element]] of ''b''").

==Axioms==
The  symbolic axioms below are from Boolos (1998: 196), and govern how sets behave and interact. The natural language versions of the axioms are intended to aid the intuition. The background logic is [[first order logic]] with [[Identity (philosophy)|identity]].
&lt;!-- The symbolic axioms should not be changed without discussion on the talk page. Altering these axioms would constitute original research. However the English descriptions may be changed. The choice of Boolos is open for discussion on the talk page. --&gt;

1) [[Axiom of Extensionality]]: The sets ''x'' and ''y'' are the same set if they have the same members.
:&lt;math&gt;\forall x \forall y [\forall z [z \in x \leftrightarrow z \in y] \rightarrow x = y].&lt;/math&gt;
The converse of this axiom follows from the substitution property of equality.

2) [[axiom schema of specification|Axiom Schema of Specification]] (or ''Separation'' or ''Restricted Comprehension''):  If ''z'' is a set and &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; is any property which may be satisfied by all, some, or no elements of ''z'', then there exists a subset ''y'' of ''z'' containing just those elements ''x'' in ''z'' which satisfy the property &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt;. The [[restriction (mathematics)|restriction]] to ''z'' is necessary to avoid [[Russell's paradox]] and its variants. More formally, let &lt;math&gt;\phi(x)&lt;/math&gt; be any formula in the language of GST in which ''x'' is free and ''y'' is not. Then all instances of the following schema are axioms:
:&lt;math&gt;\forall z \exists y \forall x [x \in y \leftrightarrow ( x \in z \land \phi(x))].&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
3) [[Axiom of Adjunction]]: If ''x'' and ''y'' are sets, then there exists a set ''w'', the ''adjunction'' of ''x'' and ''y'', whose members are just ''y'' and the members of ''x''.&lt;ref&gt;''Adjunction'' is seldom mentioned in the literature. Exceptions are Burgess (2005) ''passim'', and QIII in Tarski and Givant (1987: 223).&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!-- :&lt;math&gt; \forall x \forall z \exist y \forall v [v \in y \leftrightarrow (v \in z \or v=x)].&lt;/math&gt;--&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\forall x \forall y \exist w \forall z [ z \in w \leftrightarrow (z \in x \or z=y)].&lt;/math&gt;

''Adjunction'' refers to an elementary operation on two sets, and has no bearing on the use of that term elsewhere in mathematics, including in [[adjoint functor|category theory]].

==Discussion==
GST is the fragment of [[Zermelo set theory|Z]] obtained by omitting the axioms [[axiom of union|Union]], [[axiom of power set|Power Set]], Elementary Sets (essentially [[Pairing axiom|Pairing]]) and [[axiom of infinity|Infinity]], then taking Adjunction, a theorem of Z, as an axiom. The result is a [[first order theory]].

Setting &amp;phi;(''x'') in ''Separation'' to ''x''&amp;ne;''x'', and assuming that the [[Domain of a function|domain]] is nonempty, assures the existence of the [[empty set]]. ''Adjunction'' implies that if ''x'' is a set, then so is &lt;math&gt;S(x) = x \cup \{x\}&lt;/math&gt;. Given ''Adjunction'', the usual construction of the [[successor ordinal]]s from the [[empty set]] can proceed, one in which the [[natural number]]s are defined as &lt;math&gt;\varnothing,\,S(\varnothing),\,S(S(\varnothing)),\,\ldots,&lt;/math&gt; (see [[Peano's axioms]]). More generally, given any model ''M'' of ZFC, the collection of [[hereditarily finite set]]s in ''M'' will satisfy the GST axioms. Therefore, GST cannot prove the existence of even a countable [[infinite set]], that is, of a set whose cardinality is ℵ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;. Even if GST did afford a countably infinite set, GST could not prove the existence of a set whose [[cardinality]] is &lt;math&gt;\aleph_1&lt;/math&gt;, because GST lacks the [[axiom of power set]]. Hence GST cannot ground [[Mathematical analysis|analysis]] and [[geometry]], and is too weak to serve as a [[foundation of mathematics|foundation for mathematics]].

Boolos was interested in GST only as a fragment of [[Zermelo set theory|Z]] that is just powerful enough to interpret [[Peano arithmetic]]. He never lingered over GST, only mentioning it briefly in several papers discussing the systems of [[Frege]]'s ''[[The Foundations of Arithmetic|Grundlagen]]'' and ''Grundgesetze'', and how they could be modified to eliminate [[Russell's paradox]]. The system '''A&amp;xi;''''[&amp;delta;&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;] in Tarski and Givant (1987: 223) is essentially GST with an [[Peano axioms|axiom schema of induction]] replacing [[axiom schema of specification|Specification]], and with the existence of an [[empty set]] explicitly assumed.

GST is called STZ in Burgess (2005), p.&amp;nbsp;223.&lt;ref&gt;The [[axiom of empty set|Empty Set]] axiom in STZ is redundant, because the existence of the empty set is derivable from the axiom schema of Specification.&lt;/ref&gt; Burgess's theory ST&lt;ref&gt;Called S' in Tarski et al. (1953: 34).&lt;/ref&gt; is GST with [[axiom of empty set|Empty Set]] replacing the [[axiom schema of specification]]. That the letters "ST" also appear in "GST" is a coincidence.

==Metamathematics==
The most remarkable fact about ST (and hence GST), is that these tiny fragments of set theory give rise to such rich metamathematics. While ST is a small fragment of the well-known canonical set theories [[ZFC]] and [[Von Neumann–Bernays–Gödel set theory|NBG]], ST [[interpretability|interprets]] [[Robinson arithmetic]] (Q), so that ST inherits the nontrivial metamathematics of Q. For example, ST is [[decidability (logic)|essentially undecidable]] because Q is, and every consistent theory whose theorems include the ST axioms is also essentially undecidable.&lt;ref&gt;Burgess (2005), 2.2, p. 91.&lt;/ref&gt; This includes GST and every axiomatic set theory worth thinking about, assuming these are consistent. In fact, the [[decidability (logic)|undecidability]] of ST implies the undecidability of [[first-order logic]] with a single [[binary predicate]] letter.&lt;ref&gt;Tarski et al. (1953), p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt;

Q is also incomplete in the sense of [[Gödel's incompleteness theorem]]. Any axiomatizable theory, such as ST and GST, whose theorems include the Q axioms is likewise incomplete. Moreover, the [[consistency]] of GST cannot be proved within GST itself, unless GST is in fact inconsistent.

GST is:
*Mutually interpretable with [[Peano arithmetic]] (thus it has the same proof-theoretic strength as PA);
*Immune to the three great antinomies of [[naïve set theory]]: [[Russell's paradox|Russell's]], [[Burali-Forti paradox|Burali-Forti's]], and [[Cantor's paradox|Cantor's]];
*Not [[axiom schema|finitely axiomatizable]]. Montague (1961) showed that [[ZFC]] is not finitely axiomatizable, and his argument carries over to GST. Hence any axiomatization of GST must either include at least one [[axiom schema]] such as [[Axiom schema of specification|Separation]];
*Interpretable in [[relation algebra]] because no part of any GST axiom lies in the scope of more than three [[Quantifier (logic)|quantifier]]s. This is the [[necessary and sufficient condition]] given in Tarski and Givant (1987).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2054">In [[category theory]] in [[mathematics]] a '''family of generators''' (or '''family of separators''') of a [[category (mathematics)|category]] &lt;math&gt;\mathcal C&lt;/math&gt; is a collection &lt;math&gt;\{G_i\in Ob(\mathcal C)|i\in I\}&lt;/math&gt; of objects, indexed by some set ''I'', such that for any two morphisms &lt;math&gt;f, g: X \rightarrow Y&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal C&lt;/math&gt;, if &lt;math&gt;f\neq g&lt;/math&gt; then there is some ''i∈I'' and morphism &lt;math&gt;h : G_i \rightarrow X&lt;/math&gt;, such that the compositions &lt;math&gt;f \circ h \neq g \circ h&lt;/math&gt;. If the family consists of a single object ''G'', we say it is a '''generator''' (or '''separator'''). 

Generators are central to the definition of [[Grothendieck category|Grothendieck categories]].

The [[dual (category theory)|dual]] concept is called a '''cogenerator''' or '''coseparator'''.

==Examples==
* In the category of [[abelian groups]], the group of integers &lt;math&gt;\mathbf Z&lt;/math&gt; is a generator: If ''f'' and ''g'' are different, then there is an element &lt;math&gt;x \in X&lt;/math&gt;, such that &lt;math&gt;f(x) \neq g(x)&lt;/math&gt;. Hence the map &lt;math&gt;\mathbf Z \rightarrow X,&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;n \mapsto n \cdot x&lt;/math&gt; suffices.
* Similarly, the one-point [[Set (mathematics)|set]] is a generator for the [[category of sets]]. In fact, any nonempty set is a generator.
* In the category of sets, any set with at least two objects is a cogenerator.
* In the category of modules over a ring R, a generator in a finite direct sum with itself contains an isomorphic copy of R as a direct summand.  Consequently, a generator module is faithful, i.e. has zero [[Annihilator (ring theory)|annihilator]].

The first block is a unit block and the dashed line represents the [[#Infinite geometric series|infinite sum]] of the sequence, a number that it will forever approach but never touch: 2, 3/2, and 4/3 respectively.]]
In [[mathematics]], a '''geometric progression''', also known as a '''geometric sequence''', is a [[sequence]] of [[number]]s where each term after the first is found by multiplying the previous one by a fixed, non-zero number called the ''common ratio''. For example, the sequence 2, 6, 18, 54, ... is a geometric progression with common ratio 3. Similarly 10, 5, 2.5, 1.25, ... is a geometric sequence with common ratio 1/2.

Examples of a geometric sequence are [[exponentiation|powers]] ''r''&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt; of a fixed number ''r'', such as [[power of two|2&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;]] and 3&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;. The general form of a geometric sequence is

:&lt;math&gt;a,\ ar,\ ar^2,\ ar^3,\ ar^4,\ \ldots&lt;/math&gt;

where ''r'' ≠ 0 is the common ratio and ''a'' is a [[scale factor]], equal to the sequence's start value.

==Elementary properties==
The ''n''-th term of a geometric sequence with initial value ''a'' and common ratio ''r'' is given by
:&lt;math&gt;a_n = a\,r^{n-1}.&lt;/math&gt;

Such a geometric sequence also follows the [[recursive relation]]
:&lt;math&gt;a_n = r\,a_{n-1}&lt;/math&gt; for every integer &lt;math&gt;n\geq 1.&lt;/math&gt;

Generally, to check whether a given sequence is geometric, one simply checks whether successive entries in the sequence all have the same ratio.

The common ratio of a geometric sequence may be negative, resulting in an alternating sequence, with numbers switching from positive to negative and back. For instance
:1, −3, 9, −27, 81, −243, ...
is a geometric sequence with common ratio −3.

The behaviour of a geometric sequence depends on the value of the common ratio.&lt;br /&gt;
If the common ratio is:
* Positive, the terms will all be the same sign as the initial term.
* Negative, the terms will alternate between positive and negative.
* Greater than 1, there will be [[exponential growth]] towards [[extended real number line|positive or negative infinity]] (depending on the sign of the initial term).
* 1, the progression is a [[constant function|constant]] sequence.
* Between −1 and 1 but not zero, there will be [[exponential decay]] towards zero.
* −1, the progression is an alternating sequence
* Less than −1, for the absolute values there is exponential growth towards [[point at infinity|(unsigned) infinity]], due to the alternating sign.

Geometric sequences (with common ratio not equal to −1, 1 or 0) show exponential growth or exponential decay, as opposed to the [[linear function (calculus)|linear]] growth (or decline) of an [[arithmetic progression]] such as 4, 15, 26, 37, 48, … (with common ''difference'' 11). This result was taken by [[Thomas Robert Malthus|T.R. Malthus]] as the mathematical foundation of his ''Principle of Population''.
Note that the two kinds of progression are related: exponentiating each term of an arithmetic progression yields a geometric progression, while taking the [[logarithm]] of each term in a geometric progression with a positive common ratio yields an arithmetic progression.

An interesting result of the definition of a geometric progression is that for any value of the common ratio, any three consecutive terms ''a'', ''b'' and ''c'' will satisfy the following equation:

::&lt;math&gt;b^2=ac&lt;/math&gt;

where ''b'' is considered to be the ''geometric mean'' between ''a'' and ''c''.

&lt;div class="thumbcaption"&gt;
Computation of the sum 2 + 10 + 50 + 250. The sequence is multiplied term by term by 5, and then subtracted from the original sequence. Two terms remain: the first term, ''a'', and the term one beyond the last, or ''ar''&lt;sup&gt;''m''&lt;/sup&gt;. The desired result, 312, is found by subtracting these two terms and dividing by 1&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;5.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
A '''geometric series''' is the [[Summation|sum]] of the numbers in a geometric progression. For example:

:&lt;math&gt;2 + 10 + 50 + 250 = 2 + 2 \times 5 + 2 \times 5^2 + 2 \times 5^3. &lt;/math&gt;

Letting ''a'' be the first term (here 2), n be the number of terms (here 4), and ''r'' be the constant that each term is multiplied by to get the next term (here 5), the sum is given by:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{a(1-r^n)}{1-r}&lt;/math&gt;

In the example above, this gives:

:&lt;math&gt;2 + 10 + 50 + 250 = \frac{2(1-5^4)}{1-5} = \frac{-1248}{-4} = 312.&lt;/math&gt;

The formula works for any real numbers ''a'' and ''r'' (except ''r'' = 1, which results in a division by zero). For example:
:&lt;math&gt;-2\pi + 4\pi^2 - 8\pi^3 = -2\pi + (-2\pi)^2 + (-2\pi)^3 = \frac{-2\pi(1 - (-2\pi)^3)}{1-(-2\pi)} = \frac{-2\pi(1 + 8\pi^3)}{1+2\pi} \approx -214.855. &lt;/math&gt;
Since the derivation (below) does not depend on ''a'' and ''r'' being real, it holds for complex numbers as well.

To derive this formula, first write a general geometric series as:

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{k=1}^{n} ar^{k-1} = ar^0+ar^1+ar^2+ar^3+\cdots+ar^{n-1}. &lt;/math&gt;

We can find a simpler formula for this sum by multiplying both sides
of the above equation by 1 − ''r'', and we'll see that

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
(1-r) \sum_{k=1}^{n} ar^{k-1} &amp; = (1-r)(ar^0 + ar^1+ar^2+ar^3+\cdots+ar^{n-1}) \\
 &amp; = ar^0 + ar^1+ar^2+ar^3+\cdots+ar^{n-1} - ar^1-ar^2-ar^3-\cdots-ar^{n-1} - ar^n \\
 &amp; = a - ar^n
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

since all the other terms cancel. If ''r'' ≠ 1, we can rearrange the above to get the convenient formula for a geometric series that computes the sum of n terms:

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{k=1}^{n} ar^{k-1} = \frac{a(1-r^n)}{1-r}.&lt;/math&gt;

===Related formulas===

If one were to begin the sum not from k=1, but from a different value, say ''m'', then

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{k=m}^n ar^k=\frac{a(r^m-r^{n+1})}{1-r},&lt;/math&gt;
provided &lt;math&gt;r \neq 1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;a(n-m+1)&lt;/math&gt; when &lt;math&gt;r=1&lt;/math&gt;.

[[derivative|Differentiating]] this formula with respect to ''r'' allows us to arrive at formulae for sums of the form

:&lt;math&gt;G_s(n, r) := \sum_{k=0}^n k^s r^k.&lt;/math&gt;

For example:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dr}\sum_{k=0}^nr^k = \sum_{k=1}^n kr^{k-1}=
\frac{1-r^{n+1}}{(1-r)^2}-\frac{(n+1)r^n}{1-r}.&lt;/math&gt;

For a geometric series containing only even powers of ''r'' multiply by &amp;nbsp;1 &amp;minus; ''r''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp; :

:&lt;math&gt;(1-r^2) \sum_{k=0}^{n} ar^{2k} = a-ar^{2n+2}.&lt;/math&gt;
Then

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{k=0}^{n} ar^{2k} = \frac{a(1-r^{2n+2})}{1-r^2}.&lt;/math&gt;

Equivalently, take &amp;nbsp;''r''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp; as the common ratio and use the standard formulation.

For a series with only odd powers of ''r''

:&lt;math&gt;(1-r^2) \sum_{k=0}^{n} ar^{2k+1} = ar-ar^{2n+3}&lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{k=0}^{n} ar^{2k+1} = \frac{ar(1-r^{2n+2})}{1-r^2}.&lt;/math&gt;

An exact formula for the generalized sum &lt;math&gt;G_s(n, r)&lt;/math&gt; when &lt;math&gt;s \in \mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt; is expanded by the [[Stirling numbers of the second kind]] as &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Set Partitions: Stirling Numbers|url=https://dlmf.nist.gov/26.8|website=Digital Library of Mathematical Functions|accessdate=24 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;G_s(n, r) = \sum_{j=0}^s \left\lbrace{s \atop j}\right\rbrace x^j \frac{d^j}{dx^j}\left[\frac{1-x^{n+1}}{1-x}\right]. &lt;/math&gt;

===Infinite geometric series===
{{offtopic|Geometric series|discuss=Talk:Geometric progression#Merger proposal|date=February 2014}}
{{main|Geometric series}}
An '''infinite geometric series''' is an [[infinite series]] whose successive terms have a common ratio. Such a series converges [[if and only if]] the [[absolute value]] of the common ratio is less than one ({{abs|''r''}}&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;1). Its value can then be computed from the finite sum formula

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{k=0}^\infty ar^k = \lim_{n\to\infty}{\sum_{k=0}^{n} ar^k} = \lim_{n\to\infty}\frac{a(1-r^{n+1})}{1-r}= \frac{a}{1-r} - \lim_{n\to\infty}{\frac{ar^{n+1}}{1-r}} &lt;/math&gt;

[[Image:Geometric progression.gif|thumb|350px|Animation, showing convergence of partial sums of geometric progression &lt;math&gt;\sum\limits_{k=0}^{n}q^k&lt;/math&gt; (red line) to its sum &lt;math&gt;{1\over 1-q}&lt;/math&gt; (blue line) for &lt;math&gt;|q|&lt;1&lt;/math&gt;.]]
[[Image:Geometric progression convergence diagram.svg|thumb|350px|Diagram showing the geometric series 1 + 1/2 + 1/4 + 1/8 + ⋯ which converges to 2.]]

Since:
:&lt;math&gt; r^{n+1} \to 0 \mbox{ as } n \to \infty \mbox{ when } |r| &lt; 1.&lt;/math&gt;

Then:
:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{k=0}^\infty ar^k = \frac{a}{1-r} - 0 = \frac{a}{1-r}&lt;/math&gt;

For a series containing only even powers of &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;,

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{k=0}^\infty ar^{2k} = \frac{a}{1-r^2}&lt;/math&gt;

and for odd powers only,

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{k=0}^\infty ar^{2k+1} = \frac{ar}{1-r^2}&lt;/math&gt;

In cases where the sum does not start at ''k'' = 0,

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{k=m}^\infty ar^k=\frac{ar^m}{1-r}&lt;/math&gt;
The formulae given above are valid only for {{abs|''r''}}&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;1. The latter formula is valid in every [[Banach algebra]], as long as the norm of ''r'' is less than one, and also in the field of [[p-adic numbers|''p''-adic numbers]] if {{abs|''r''}}&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;1. As in the case for a finite sum, we can differentiate to calculate formulae for related sums.
For example,

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dr}\sum_{k=0}^\infty r^k = \sum_{k=1}^\infty kr^{k-1}=
\frac{1}{(1-r)^2}&lt;/math&gt;

This formula only works for {{abs|''r''}}&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;1 as well. From this, it follows that, for {{abs|''r''}}&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;1,

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{k=0}^{\infty} k r^k = \frac{r}{\left(1-r\right)^2} \,;\, \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} k^2 r^k = \frac{r \left( 1+r \right)}{\left(1-r\right)^3} \, ; \, \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} k^3 r^k = \frac{r \left( 1+4 r + r^2\right)}{\left( 1-r\right)^4}&lt;/math&gt;

Also, the infinite series [[1/2 + 1/4 + 1/8 + 1/16 + ⋯]] is an elementary example of a series that [[absolute convergence|converges absolutely]].

It is a [[geometric series]] whose first term is 1/2 and whose common ratio is 1/2, so its sum is
:&lt;math&gt;\frac12+\frac14+\frac18+\frac{1}{16}+\cdots=\frac{1/2}{1-(+1/2)} = 1.&lt;/math&gt;

The inverse of the above series is [[1/2 − 1/4 + 1/8 − 1/16 + ⋯]] is a simple example of an [[alternating series]] that converges absolutely.

It is a [[geometric series]] whose first term is 1/2 and whose common ratio is −1/2, so its sum is
:&lt;math&gt;\frac12-\frac14+\frac18-\frac{1}{16}+\cdots=\frac{1/2}{1-(-1/2)} = \frac13.&lt;/math&gt;

===Complex numbers===
The summation formula for geometric series remains valid even when the common ratio is a [[complex number]]. In this case the condition that the absolute value of ''r'' be less than 1 becomes that the [[Absolute value#Complex numbers|modulus]] of ''r'' be less than 1. It is possible to calculate the sums of some non-obvious geometric series. For example, consider the proposition

: &lt;math&gt; \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \frac{\sin(kx)}{r^k} = \frac{r \sin(x)}{1 + r^2 - 2 r \cos(x)} &lt;/math&gt;

The proof of this comes from the fact that
: &lt;math&gt;\sin(kx) = \frac{e^{ikx} - e^{-ikx}}{2i} , &lt;/math&gt;
which is a consequence of [[Euler's formula]]. Substituting this into the original series gives
: &lt;math&gt; \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \frac{\sin(kx)}{r^k} = \frac{1}{2 i} \left[ \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \left( \frac{e^{ix}}{r} \right)^k - \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \left(\frac{e^{-ix}}{r}\right)^k\right]&lt;/math&gt;.

This is the difference of two geometric series, and so it is a straightforward application of the formula for infinite geometric series that completes the proof.

==Product==
The product of a geometric progression is the product of all terms. If all terms are positive, then it can be quickly computed by taking the [[geometric mean]] of the progression's first and last term, and raising that mean to the power given by the number of terms. (This is very similar to the formula for the sum of terms of an [[arithmetic sequence]]: take the [[arithmetic mean]] of the first and last term and multiply with the number of terms.)

:&lt;math&gt;\prod_{i=0}^{n} ar^i = \left( \sqrt{a_0 \cdot a_{n}}\right)^{n+1}&lt;/math&gt; (if &lt;math&gt;a,r &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;).

Proof:

Let the product be represented by P:

:&lt;math&gt;P=a \cdot ar \cdot ar^2 \cdots ar^{n-1} \cdot ar^{n}&lt;/math&gt;.

Now, carrying out the multiplications, we conclude that

:&lt;math&gt;P=a^{n+1} r^{1+2+3+ \cdots +(n-1)+(n)}&lt;/math&gt;.

Applying the sum of [[arithmetic series]], the expression will yield

:&lt;math&gt;P=a^{n+1} r^{\frac{n(n+1)}{2}}&lt;/math&gt;.

:&lt;math&gt;P=(ar^{\frac{n}{2}})^{n+1}&lt;/math&gt;.

We raise both sides to the second power:

:&lt;math&gt;P^2=(a^2 r^{n})^{n+1}=(a\cdot ar^n)^{n+1}&lt;/math&gt;.

Consequently,

:&lt;math&gt;P^2=(a_0 \cdot a_{n})^{n+1}&lt;/math&gt; and
:&lt;math&gt;P=(a_0 \cdot a_{n})^{\frac{n+1}{2}}&lt;/math&gt;,

which concludes the proof.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="52700">This is a glossary of some terms used in the branch of [[mathematics]] known as [[topology]]. Although there is no absolute distinction between different areas of topology, the focus here is on [[general topology]]. The following definitions are also fundamental to [[algebraic topology]], [[differential topology]] and [[geometric topology]].

All spaces in this glossary are assumed to be [[topological space]]s unless stated otherwise.
__NOTOC__
{{Compact ToC|short1|sym=no|seealso=yes|refs=yes}}

== A ==

;Absolutely closed: See ''H-closed''

;Accessible: See '''[[T1 space|&lt;math&gt;T_1&lt;/math&gt;]]'''.

;Accumulation point: See [[limit point]].

;[[Alexandrov topology]]:  The topology of a space ''X'' is an [[Alexandrov topology]] (or is '''finitely generated''') if arbitrary intersections of open sets in ''X'' are open, or equivalently, if arbitrary unions of closed sets are closed, or, again equivalently, if the open sets are the [[upper set]]s of a [[poset]].&lt;ref&gt;Vickers (1989) p.22&lt;/ref&gt;

;Almost discrete: A space is almost discrete if every open set is closed (hence clopen). The almost discrete spaces are precisely the finitely generated zero-dimensional spaces.

;[[Approach space]]:  An [[approach space]] is a generalization of metric space based on point-to-set distances, instead of point-to-point.

== B ==

;Baire space: This has two distinct common meanings:
:#A space is a '''Baire space''' if the intersection of any [[countable]] collection of dense open sets is dense; see [[Baire space]].
:#'''Baire space''' is the set of all functions from the natural numbers to the natural numbers, with the topology of pointwise convergence; see [[Baire space (set theory)]].

;[[Base (topology)|Base]]: A collection ''B'' of open sets is a [[base (topology)|base]] (or '''basis''') for a topology &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; if every open set in &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; is a union of sets in &lt;math&gt; B &lt;/math&gt;. The topology &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; is the smallest topology on &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; containing &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; and is said to be generated by &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;.

;[[Basis (topology)|Basis]]: See '''[[Base (topology)|Base]]'''.

;[[Borel algebra]]: The [[Borel algebra]] on a topological space &lt;math&gt; (X,\tau)&lt;/math&gt; is the smallest [[Sigma-algebra|&lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt;-algebra]] containing all the open sets. It is obtained by taking intersection of all &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt;-algebras on &lt;math&gt; X &lt;/math&gt; containing &lt;math&gt; \tau &lt;/math&gt;.

;Borel set: A Borel set is an element of a Borel algebra.

;[[Boundary (topology)|Boundary]]: The [[boundary (topology)|boundary]] (or '''frontier''') of a set is the set's closure minus its interior.  Equivalently, the boundary of a set is the intersection of its closure with the closure of its complement. Boundary of a set &lt;math&gt; A &lt;/math&gt; is denoted by &lt;math&gt; \partial A&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;bd&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;.

;[[Bounded set|Bounded]]: A set in a metric space is [[bounded set|bounded]] if it has [[finite set|finite]] diameter. Equivalently, a set is bounded if it is contained in some open ball of finite radius. A [[function (mathematics)|function]] taking values in a metric space is [[bounded function|bounded]] if its [[image (functions)|image]] is a bounded set.

== C ==

;[[Category of topological spaces]]: The [[category theory|category]] '''[[Category of topological spaces|Top]]''' has [[topological space]]s as [[object (category theory)|objects]] and [[continuous map]]s as [[morphism]]s.

;[[Cauchy sequence]]: A [[sequence]] {''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;} in a metric space (''M'', ''d'') is a [[Cauchy sequence]] if, for every [[positive number|positive]] [[real number]] ''r'', there is an [[integer]] ''N'' such that for all integers ''m'', ''n'' &gt; ''N'', we have ''d''(''x''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) &lt; ''r''.

;[[Clopen set]]: A set is [[clopen set|clopen]] if it is both open and closed.

;Closed ball: If (''M'', ''d'') is a [[metric space]], a closed ball is a set of the form ''D''(''x''; ''r'') := {''y'' in ''M'' : ''d''(''x'', ''y'') ≤ ''r''}, where ''x'' is in ''M'' and ''r'' is a [[positive number|positive]] [[real number]], the '''radius''' of the ball. A closed ball of radius ''r'' is a '''closed ''r''-ball'''. Every closed ball is a closed set in the topology induced on ''M'' by ''d''. Note that the closed ball ''D''(''x''; ''r'') might not be equal to the [[closure (topology)|closure]] of the open ball ''B''(''x''; ''r'').

;[[Closed set]]: A set is [[Closed set|closed]] if its complement is a member of the topology.

;[[Closed function]]: A function from one space to another is closed if the [[image (mathematics)|image]] of every closed set is closed.

;[[Closure (topology)|Closure]]: The [[closure (topology)|closure]] of a set is the smallest closed set containing the original set. It is equal to the intersection of all closed sets which contain it. An element of the closure of a set ''S'' is a '''point of closure''' of ''S''.

;Closure operator: See '''[[Kuratowski closure axioms]]'''.

;[[Coarser topology]]: If ''X'' is a set, and if ''T''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''T''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are topologies on ''X'', then ''T''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is [[coarser topology|coarser]] (or '''smaller''', '''weaker''') than ''T''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; if ''T''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is contained in ''T''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Beware, some authors, especially [[mathematical analysis|analyst]]s, use the term '''stronger'''.

;Comeagre: A subset ''A'' of a space ''X'' is '''comeagre''' ('''comeager''') if its [[complement (set theory)|complement]] ''X''\''A'' is [[meagre set|meagre]]. Also called '''residual'''.

;[[Compact space|Compact]]: A space is [[compact space|compact]] if every open cover has a [[finite set|finite]] subcover. Every compact space is Lindelöf and paracompact. Therefore, every compact [[Hausdorff space]] is normal. See also '''quasicompact'''.

;[[Compact-open topology]]: The [[compact-open topology]] on the set ''C''(''X'', ''Y'') of all continuous maps between two spaces ''X'' and ''Y'' is defined as follows: given a compact subset ''K'' of ''X'' and an open subset ''U'' of ''Y'', let ''V''(''K'', ''U'') denote the set of all maps ''f'' in ''C''(''X'', ''Y'') such that ''f''(''K'') is contained in ''U''. Then the collection of all such ''V''(''K'', ''U'') is a subbase for the compact-open topology.

;[[Complete space|Complete]]: A metric space is [[complete space|complete]] if every Cauchy sequence converges.

;Completely metrizable/completely metrisable: See '''[[complete space]]'''.

;Completely normal Hausdorff: A completely normal Hausdorff space (or [[T5 space|'''T&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;''' space]]) is a completely normal T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; space. (A completely normal space is Hausdorff [[if and only if]] it is T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, so the terminology is [[consistent]].) Every completely normal Hausdorff space is normal Hausdorff.

;[[Completely regular space|Completely regular]]: A space is [[Completely regular space|completely regular]] if, whenever ''C'' is a closed set and ''x'' is a point not in ''C'', then ''C'' and {''x''} are functionally separated.

;[[Completely T3 space|Completely T&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]]: See '''[[Tychonoff space|Tychonoff]]'''.

;Component: See '''[[Connected space|Connected component]]'''/'''Path-connected component'''.

;[[Connected (topology)|Connected]]: A space is [[connected (topology)|connected]] if it is not the union of a pair of [[Disjoint sets|disjoint]] nonempty open sets. Equivalently, a space is connected if the only clopen sets are the whole space and the empty set.

;[[connected space|Connected component]]: A [[connected space|connected component]] of a space is a [[maximal set|maximal]] nonempty connected subspace. Each connected component is closed, and the set of connected components of a space is a [[partition of a set|partition]] of that space.

;[[Continuity (topology)|Continuous]]: A function from one space to another is [[continuity (topology)|continuous]] if the [[preimage]] of every open set is open.

;Continuum: A space is called a continuum if it a compact, connected Hausdorff space.

;[[Contractible space|Contractible]]: A space ''X'' is contractible if the [[identity function|identity map]] on ''X'' is homotopic to a constant map. Every contractible space is simply connected.

;Coproduct topology: If {''X''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;} is a collection of spaces and ''X'' is the (set-theoretic) [[disjoint union]] of {''X''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}, then the coproduct topology (or '''disjoint union topology''', '''topological sum''' of the ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;) on ''X'' is the finest topology for which all the injection maps are continuous.

;[[Cosmic space]]: A [[continuous function|continuous]] [[Image (mathematics)|image]] of some [[Separable space|separable]] [[metric space]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Encyclopedia of Distances | first1=Michel Marie | last1=Deza | first2=Elena | last2=Deza | publisher=[[Springer-Verlag]] | year=2012 | isbn=3642309585 | page=64 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

;[[Countable chain condition]]: A space ''X'' satisfies the countable chain condition if every family of non-empty, pairswise disjoint open sets is countable.

;Countably compact: A space is countably compact if every [[countable]] open cover has a [[finite set|finite]] subcover. Every countably compact space is pseudocompact and weakly countably compact.

;Countably locally finite:  A collection of subsets of a space ''X'' is '''countably locally finite''' (or '''σ-locally finite''') if it is the union of a [[countable]] collection of locally finite collections of subsets of ''X''.

;[[Cover (topology)|Cover]]: A collection of subsets of a space is a cover (or '''covering''') of that space if the union of the collection is the whole space.

;Covering: See '''Cover'''.

;Cut point: If ''X'' is a connected space with more than one point, then a point ''x'' of ''X'' is a cut point if the subspace ''X'' − {''x''} is disconnected.

== D ==
;[[Dense set]]: A set is dense if it has nonempty intersection with every nonempty open set. Equivalently, a set is dense if its closure is the whole space.

;[[Dense-in-itself]] set: A set is dense-in-itself if it has no [[isolated point]].

;Density: the minimal cardinality of a dense subset of a topological space.  A set of density ℵ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is a [[separable space]].&lt;ref&gt;Nagata (1985) p.104&lt;/ref&gt;

;Derived set: If ''X'' is a space and ''S'' is a subset of ''X'', the derived set of ''S'' in ''X'' is the set of limit points of ''S'' in ''X''.

;Developable space: A topological space with a [[Development (topology)|development]].&lt;ref name=ss163/&gt;

;[[Development (topology)|Development]]: A [[countable set|countable]] collection of [[open cover]]s of a topological space, such that for any closed set ''C'' and any point ''p'' in its complement there exists a cover in the collection such that every neighbourhood of ''p'' in the cover is [[disjoint sets|disjoint]] from ''C''.&lt;ref name=ss163/&gt;

;Diameter: If (''M'', ''d'') is a metric space and ''S'' is a subset of ''M'', the diameter of ''S'' is the [[supremum]] of the distances ''d''(''x'', ''y''), where ''x'' and ''y'' range over ''S''.

;Discrete metric: The discrete metric on a set ''X'' is the function ''d'' : ''X'' × ''X'' &amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp; '''[[real number|R]]''' such that for all ''x'', ''y'' in ''X'', ''d''(''x'', ''x'') = 0 and ''d''(''x'', ''y'') = 1 if ''x'' ≠ ''y''. The discrete metric induces the discrete topology on ''X''.

;[[Discrete space]]: A space ''X'' is [[discrete space|discrete]] if every subset of ''X'' is open. We say that ''X'' carries the '''discrete topology'''.&lt;ref name=ss41&gt;Steen &amp;amp; Seebach (1978) p.41&lt;/ref&gt;

;[[Discrete topology]]: See '''[[discrete space]]'''.

;Disjoint union topology: See '''Coproduct topology'''.

;[[Dispersion point]]: If ''X'' is a connected space with more than one point, then a point ''x'' of ''X'' is a dispersion point if the subspace ''X'' − {''x''} is hereditarily disconnected (its only connected components are the one-point sets).

;[[Limit point]]: A point ''x'' in a space ''X'' is a [[limit point]] of a subset ''S'' if every open set containing ''x'' also contains a point of ''S'' other than ''x'' itself. This is equivalent to requiring that every neighbourhood of ''x'' contains a point of ''S'' other than ''x'' itself.

;[[Lindelöf space|Lindelöf]]: A space is [[Lindelöf space|Lindelöf]] if every open cover has a [[countable]] subcover.

;Local basis: See '''Local base'''.

;Locally (P) space: There are two definitions for a space to be "locally (P)" where (P) is a topological or set-theoretic property: that each point has a neighbourhood with property (P), or that every point has a neighourbood base for which each member has property (P).  The first definition is usually taken for locally compact, countably compact, metrisable, separable, countable; the second for locally connected.&lt;ref name=EGT65&gt;Hart et al (2004) p.65&lt;/ref&gt;

;Locally closed subset: A subset of a topological space that is the intersection of an open and a closed subset.  Equivalently, it is a relatively open subset of its closure.

;[[Locally compact space|Locally compact]]: A space is [[Locally compact space|locally compact]] if every point has a compact neighbourhood: the alternative definition that each point has a local base consisting of compact neighbourhoods is sometimes used: these are equivalent for Hausdorff spaces.&lt;ref name=EGT65/&gt;  Every locally compact Hausdorff space is Tychonoff.

;Metric invariant: A metric invariant is a property which is preserved under isometric isomorphism.

;[[Metric map]]: If ''X'' and ''Y'' are metric spaces with metrics ''d''&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt; and ''d''&lt;sub&gt;''Y''&lt;/sub&gt; respectively, then a [[metric map]] is a function ''f'' from ''X'' to ''Y'', such that for any points ''x'' and ''y'' in ''X'', ''d''&lt;sub&gt;''Y''&lt;/sub&gt;(''f''(''x''), ''f''(''y'')) ≤ ''d''&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'', ''y''). A metric map is [[metric map|strictly metric]] if the above inequality is strict for all ''x'' and ''y'' in ''X''.

;[[Metric space]]: A [[metric space]] (''M'', ''d'') is a set ''M'' equipped with a function ''d'' :&amp;nbsp;''M''&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;''M''&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;'''[[real number|R]]''' satisfying the following axioms for all ''x'', ''y'', and ''z'' in ''M'':
:# ''d''(''x'', ''y'') ≥ 0
:# ''d''(''x'', ''x'') = 0
:# if &amp;nbsp; ''d''(''x'', ''y'') = 0 &amp;nbsp; then &amp;nbsp; ''x'' = ''y'' &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (''identity of indiscernibles'')

:# ''d''(''x'', ''z'') ≤ ''d''(''x'', ''y'') + ''d''(''y'', ''z'') &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;  (''[[triangle inequality]]'')

:The function ''d'' is a '''metric''' on ''M'', and ''d''(''x'', ''y'') is the '''distance''' between ''x'' and ''y''. The collection of all open balls of ''M'' is a base for a topology on ''M''; this is the topology on ''M'' induced by ''d''. Every metric space is Hausdorff and paracompact (and hence normal and Tychonoff). Every metric space is first-countable.

;[[Metrizable]]'''/'''Metrisable: A space is [[metrizable]] if it is homeomorphic to a metric space. Every metrizable space is Hausdorff and paracompact (and hence normal and Tychonoff). Every metrizable space is first-countable.

;[[Neighbourhood (mathematics)|Neighbourhood]]'''/'''Neighborhood: A neighbourhood of a point ''x'' is a set containing an open set which in turn contains the point ''x''. More generally, a neighbourhood of a set ''S'' is a set containing an open set which in turn contains the set ''S''. A neighbourhood of a point ''x'' is thus a neighbourhood of the [[singleton (mathematics)|singleton]] set {''x''}. (Note that under this definition, the neighbourhood itself need not be open. Many authors require that neighbourhoods be open; be careful to note conventions.)

;[[Net (mathematics)|Net]]: A [[net (mathematics)|net]] in a space ''X'' is a map from a [[directed set]] ''A'' to ''X''. A net from ''A'' to ''X'' is usually denoted (''x''&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt;), where α is an [[index set|index variable]] ranging over ''A''. Every [[sequence]] is a net, taking ''A'' to be the directed set of [[natural number]]s with the usual ordering.

;[[Normal space|Normal]]: A space is [[normal space|normal]] if any two disjoint closed sets have disjoint neighbourhoods.&lt;ref name=ss162/&gt;  Every normal space admits a partition of unity.

;[[T4 space|Normal Hausdorff]]: A [[T4 space|normal Hausdorff]] space (or [[T4 space|'''T&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;''' space]]) is a normal T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; space. (A normal space is Hausdorff [[if and only if]] it is T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, so the terminology is consistent.) Every normal Hausdorff space is Tychonoff.

An open ball of radius ''r'' is an '''open ''r''-ball'''. Every open ball is an open set in the topology on ''M'' induced by ''d''.
; Open condition:  See '''open property'''.
; [[Open set]]: An [[open set]] is a member of the topology.
; [[Open map|Open function]]: A function from one space to another is [[open map|open]] if the [[image (mathematics)|image]] of every open set is open.
; Open property:  A property of points in a [[topological space]] is said to be "open" if those points which possess it form an [[open set]].  Such conditions often take a common form, and that form can be said to be an ''open condition''; for example, in [[metric space]]s, one defines an open ball as above, and says that "strict inequality is an open condition".

;[[Path (topology)|Path]]: A [[Path (topology)|path]] in a space ''X'' is a continuous map ''f'' from the closed unit [[interval (mathematics)|interval]] [0, 1] into ''X''. The point ''f''(0) is the initial point of ''f''; the point ''f''(1) is the terminal point of ''f''.&lt;ref name=ss29&gt;Steen &amp;amp; Seebach (1978) p.29&lt;/ref&gt;

;Point: A point is an element of a topological space. More generally, a point is an element of any set with an underlying topological structure; e.g. an element of a metric space or a topological group is also a "point".

;Point of closure: See '''[[Closure (topology)|Closure]]'''.

;[[Polish space|Polish]]: A space is Polish if it is separable and completely metrizable, i.e. if it is homeomorphic to a separable and complete metric space.

;[[Polyadic space|Polyadic]]: A space is polyadic if it is the continuous image of the power of a [[one-point compactification]] of a locally compact, non-compact Hausdorff space.

;P-point: A point of a topological space is a P-point if its filter of neighbourhoods is closed under countable intersections.

;Pre-compact: See '''[[Relatively compact]]'''.

;Prodiscrete topology: The prodiscrete topology on a product ''A''&lt;sup&gt;''G''&lt;/sup&gt; is the product topology when each factor ''A'' is given the discrete topology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1=Ceccherini-Silberstein | first1=Tullio | last2=Coornaert | first2=Michel | title=Cellular automata and groups | zbl=1218.37004 | series=Springer Monographs in Mathematics | location=Berlin | publisher=[[Springer-Verlag]] | isbn=978-3-642-14033-4 | year=2010 | page=3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

;[[Product topology]]: If {''X''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;} is a collection of spaces and ''X'' is the (set-theoretic) [[Cartesian product|product]] of {''X''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}, then the [[product topology]] on ''X'' is the coarsest topology for which all the projection maps are continuous.

;Proper function/mapping: A continuous function ''f'' from a space ''X'' to a space ''Y'' is proper if ''f''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;(''C'') is a compact set in ''X'' for any compact subspace ''C'' of ''Y''.

;[[Proximity space]]: A proximity space (''X'',&amp;nbsp;'''δ''') is a set ''X'' equipped with a [[binary relation]] '''δ''' between subsets of ''X'' satisfying the following properties:

:For all subsets ''A'', ''B'' and ''C'' of ''X'',
:#''A'' '''δ''' ''B'' implies ''B'' '''δ''' ''A''
:#''A'' '''δ''' ''B'' implies ''A'' is non-empty

;Pseudocompact: A space is pseudocompact if every [[real number|real-valued]] continuous function on the space is bounded.

;Pseudometric: See '''Pseudometric space'''.

;Pseudometric space: A pseudometric space (''M'', ''d'') is a set ''M'' equipped with a function ''d'' :&amp;nbsp;''M''&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;''M''&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;'''[[real number|R]]''' satisfying all the conditions of a metric space, except possibly the identity of indiscernibles. That is, points in a pseudometric space may be "infinitely close" without being identical.  The function ''d'' is a '''pseudometric''' on ''M''. Every metric is a pseudometric.

;Punctured neighbourhood'''/'''Punctured neighborhood: A punctured neighbourhood of a point ''x'' is a neighbourhood of ''x'', minus {''x''}. For instance, the [[interval (mathematics)|interval]] (−1, 1) = {''y'' : −1 &lt; ''y'' &lt; 1} is a neighbourhood of ''x'' = 0 in the [[real line]], so the set (−1, 0) ∪ (0, 1) = (−1, 1) − {0} is a punctured neighbourhood of 0.

== Q ==

;Quasicompact: See '''[[compact space|compact]]'''. Some authors define "compact" to include the [[Hausdorff space|Hausdorff]] separation axiom, and they use the term '''quasicompact''' to mean what we call in this glossary simply "compact" (without the Hausdorff axiom). This convention is most commonly found in French, and branches of mathematics heavily influenced by the French.

;Quotient map: If ''X'' and ''Y'' are spaces, and if ''f'' is a [[surjection]] from ''X'' to ''Y'', then ''f'' is a quotient map (or '''identification map''') if, for every subset ''U'' of ''Y'', ''U'' is open in ''Y'' [[if and only if]] ''f''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;tt&gt;-&lt;/tt&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;(''U'') is open in ''X''.  In other words, ''Y'' has the ''f''-strong topology.  Equivalently, &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is a quotient map if and only if it is the transfinite composition of maps &lt;math&gt;X\rightarrow X/Z&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;Z\subset X&lt;/math&gt; is a subset. Note that this doesn't imply that ''f'' is an open function.

;[[Quotient space (topology)|Quotient space]]: If ''X'' is a space, ''Y'' is a set, and ''f'' :&amp;nbsp;''X''&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;''Y'' is any [[surjection|surjective]] function, then the [[Quotient space (topology)|quotient topology]] on ''Y'' induced by ''f'' is the finest topology for which ''f'' is continuous. The space ''X'' is a quotient space or '''identification space'''. By definition, ''f'' is a quotient map. The most common example of this is to consider an [[equivalence relation]] on ''X'', with ''Y'' the set of [[equivalence class]]es and ''f'' the natural projection map. This construction is dual to the construction of the subspace topology.

; [[Regular space|Regular]]: A space is [[regular space|regular]] if, whenever ''C'' is a closed set and ''x'' is a point not in ''C'', then ''C'' and ''x'' have [[Disjoint sets|disjoint]] neighbourhoods.
; [[T3 space|Regular Hausdorff]]: A space is [[T3 space|regular Hausdorff]] (or '''T&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;''') if it is a regular T&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; space.  (A regular space is Hausdorff [[if and only if]] it is T&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, so the terminology is consistent.)
; {{visible anchor|Regular open}}: A subset of a space ''X'' is regular open if it equals the interior of its closure; dually, a regular closed set is equal to the closure of its interior.&lt;ref name="Steen &amp; Seebach 1978 p.6"&gt;Steen &amp; Seebach (1978) p.6&lt;/ref&gt;  An example of a non-regular open set is the set  ''U'' = {{open-open|0,1}} ∪ {{open-open|1,2}} in '''R''' with its normal topology, since 1 is in the interior of the closure of ''U'', but not in ''U''. The regular open subsets of a space form a [[complete Boolean algebra]].&lt;ref name="Steen &amp; Seebach 1978 p.6"/&gt;
; [[Relatively compact]]: A subset ''Y'' of a space ''X'' is [[relatively compact]] in ''X'' if the closure of ''Y'' in ''X'' is compact.
; Residual: If ''X'' is a space and ''A'' is a subset of ''X'', then ''A'' is residual in ''X'' if the complement of ''A'' is meagre in ''X''. Also called '''comeagre''' or '''comeager'''.
; Resolvable: A [[topological space]] is called [[resolvable space|resolvable]] if it is expressible as the union of two [[disjoint sets|disjoint]] [[dense subset]]s.

;[[S-space]]:  An ''S-space'' is a [[Hereditary property#In topology|hereditarily]] [[Separable space|separable]] space which is not hereditarily [[Lindelöf space|Lindelöf]].&lt;ref name=GKW290/&gt;

;Scattered: A space ''X'' is scattered if every nonempty subset ''A'' of ''X'' contains a point isolated in ''A''.

;[[Scott continuity|Scott]]: The [[Scott topology]] on a [[poset]] is that in which the open sets are those [[Upper set]]s inaccessible by directed joins.&lt;ref&gt;Vickers (1989) p.95&lt;/ref&gt;

;Second category: See '''Meagre'''.

;[[Second-countable space|Second-countable]]: A space is [[second-countable space|second-countable]] or '''perfectly separable''' if it has a [[countable]] base for its topology.&lt;ref name=ss162/&gt; Every second-countable space is first-countable, separable, and Lindelöf.

;[[Semilocally simply connected]]: A space ''X'' is [[semilocally simply connected]] if, for every point ''x'' in ''X'', there is a neighbourhood ''U'' of ''x'' such that every loop at ''x'' in ''U'' is homotopic in ''X'' to the constant loop ''x''. Every simply connected space and every locally simply connected space is semilocally simply connected. (Compare with locally simply connected; here, the homotopy is allowed to live in ''X'', whereas in the definition of locally simply connected, the homotopy must live in ''U''.)

;[[semiregular space|Semiregular]]: A space is semiregular if the regular open sets form a base.

;[[Separable (topology)|Separable]]: A space is [[separable (topology)|separable]] if it has a [[countable]] dense subset.&lt;ref name=ss162/&gt;&lt;ref name=ss7/&gt;

;[[Separated sets|Separated]]: Two sets ''A'' and ''B'' are [[separated sets|separated]] if each is [[Disjoint sets|disjoint]] from the other's closure.

;Sequentially compact: A space is sequentially compact if every [[sequence]] has a convergent subsequence. Every sequentially compact space is countably compact, and every first-countable, countably compact space is sequentially compact.

;[[Short map]]: See '''[[metric map]]'''

;[[Simply connected space|Simply connected]]: A space is [[simply connected space|simply connected]] if it is path-connected and every loop is homotopic to a constant map.

;Smaller topology: See '''[[Coarser topology]]'''.

;[[Sober space|Sober]]: In a [[sober space]], every [[hyperconnected space|irreducible]] closed subset is the [[closure (topology)|closure]] of exactly one point: that is, has a unique [[generic point]].&lt;ref&gt;Vickers (1989) p.66&lt;/ref&gt;

;Star: The star of a point in a given [[cover (topology)|cover]] of a [[topological space]] is the union of all the sets in the cover that contain the point. See '''[[star refinement]]'''.

;&lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;-Strong topology:  Let &lt;math&gt;f\colon X\rightarrow Y&lt;/math&gt; be a map of topological spaces.  We say that &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; has the &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;-strong topology if, for every subset &lt;math&gt;U\subset Y&lt;/math&gt;, one has that &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; is open in &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;f^{-1}(U)&lt;/math&gt; is open in &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;

;Stronger topology: See '''[[Finer topology]]'''. Beware, some authors, especially [[mathematical analysis|analyst]]s, use the term '''weaker topology'''.

;[[Subbase]]: A collection of open sets is a [[subbase]] (or '''subbasis''') for a topology if every non-empty proper open set in the topology is a union of [[finite set|finite]] intersections of sets in the subbase. If ''B'' is ''any'' collection of subsets of a set ''X'', the topology on ''X'' generated by ''B'' is the smallest topology containing ''B''; this topology consists of the empty set, ''X'' and all unions of finite intersections of elements of ''B''.

;[[Subbase|Subbasis]]: See '''[[Subbase]]'''.

;Subcover: A cover ''K'' is a subcover (or '''subcovering''') of a cover ''L'' if every member of ''K'' is a member of ''L''.

;Subcovering: See '''Subcover'''.
;Submaximal space: A [[topological space]] is said to be '''submaximal''' if every subset of it is locally closed, that is, every subset is the intersection of an [[open set]] and a [[closed set]].

Here are some facts about submaximality as a property of topological spaces:

* Every [[door space]] is submaximal.
* Every submaximal space is ''weakly submaximal'' viz every finite set is locally closed.
* Every submaximal space is [[irresolvable space|irresolvable]]&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | title=Recent progress in general topology | volume=2 | series=Recent Progress in General Topology | author1=Miroslav Hušek | author2=J. van Mill | publisher=Elsevier | year=2002 | isbn=0-444-50980-1 | page=21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Subspace: If ''T'' is a topology on a space ''X'', and if ''A'' is a subset of ''X'', then the [[subspace topology]] on ''A'' induced by ''T'' consists of all intersections of open sets in ''T'' with ''A''. This construction is dual to the construction of the quotient topology.

== T ==

;[[T0 space|T&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;]]: A space is [[T0 space|T&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;]] (or '''Kolmogorov''') if for every pair of distinct points ''x'' and ''y'' in the space, either there is an open set containing ''x'' but not ''y'', or there is an open set containing ''y'' but not ''x''.

;[[T1 space|T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;]]: A space is [[T1 space|T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;]] (or '''Fréchet''' or '''accessible''') if for every pair of distinct points ''x'' and ''y'' in the space, there is an open set containing ''x'' but not ''y''. (Compare with T&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;; here, we are allowed to specify which point will be contained in the open set.) Equivalently, a space is T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; if all its [[singleton (mathematics)|singleton]]s are closed. Every T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; space is T&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;.

;[[Category of topological spaces|Top]]: See '''[[Category of topological spaces]]'''.

;[[Topological invariant]]: A topological invariant is a property which is preserved under homeomorphism. For example, compactness and connectedness are topological properties, whereas boundedness and completeness are not. [[Algebraic topology]] is the study of topologically invariant [[abstract algebra]] constructions on topological spaces.

;[[Topological space]]: A [[topological space]] (''X'', ''T'') is a set ''X'' equipped with a collection ''T'' of subsets of ''X'' satisfying the following [[axiom]]s:

:# The empty set and ''X'' are in ''T''.
:# The union of any collection of sets in ''T'' is also in ''T''.
:# The intersection of any pair of sets in ''T'' is also in ''T''.

:The collection ''T'' is a '''topology''' on ''X''.

;Topological sum: See '''Coproduct topology'''.

;Topologically complete: [[Completely metrizable space]]s (i. e. topological spaces homeomorphic to complete metric spaces) are often called ''topologically complete''; sometimes the term is also used for [[Čech-complete space]]s or [[completely uniformizable space]]s.

;Topology: See '''[[Topological space]]'''.

;Totally bounded: A metric space ''M'' is totally bounded if, for every ''r'' &gt; 0, there exist a [[finite set|finite]] cover of ''M'' by open balls of radius ''r''. A metric space is compact if and only if it is complete and totally bounded.

;Totally disconnected: A space is totally disconnected if it has no connected subset with more than one point.

;[[Trivial topology]]: The [[trivial topology]] (or '''indiscrete topology''') on a set ''X'' consists of precisely the empty set and the entire space ''X''.

;[[Tychonoff space|Tychonoff]]: A [[Tychonoff space]] (or '''completely regular Hausdorff''' space, '''completely T&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;''' space, '''T&lt;sub&gt;3.5&lt;/sub&gt;''' space) is a completely regular T&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; space.  (A completely regular space is Hausdorff [[if and only if]] it is T&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, so the terminology is consistent.) Every Tychonoff space is regular Hausdorff.

== U ==

;Ultra-connected: A space is ultra-connected if no two non-empty closed sets are disjoint.&lt;ref name="ss29"/&gt; Every ultra-connected space is path-connected.

;[[Ultrametric space|Ultrametric]]: A metric is an ultrametric if it satisfies the following stronger version of the [[triangle inequality]]: for all ''x'', ''y'', ''z'' in ''M'', ''d''(''x'', ''z'') ≤ max(''d''(''x'', ''y''), ''d''(''y'', ''z'')).

;[[Uniform isomorphism]]: If ''X'' and ''Y'' are [[uniform space]]s, a uniform isomorphism from ''X'' to ''Y'' is a bijective function ''f'' : ''X'' → ''Y'' such that ''f'' and ''f''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; are [[uniformly continuous]]. The spaces are then said to be uniformly isomorphic and share the same [[uniform properties]].

;[[Uniformizable]]/Uniformisable: A space is uniformizable if it is homeomorphic to a uniform space.

;[[Uniform space]]: A [[uniform space]] is a set ''U'' equipped with a nonempty collection Φ of subsets of the [[Cartesian product]] ''X'' × ''X'' satisfying the following [[axiom]]s:

:# if ''U'' is in Φ, then ''U'' contains { (''x'', ''x'') | ''x'' in ''X'' }.
:# if ''U'' is in Φ, then { (''y'', ''x'') | (''x'', ''y'') in ''U'' } is also in Φ
:# if ''U'' is in Φ and ''V'' is a subset of ''X'' × ''X'' which contains ''U'', then ''V'' is in Φ
:# if ''U'' and ''V'' are in Φ, then ''U'' ∩ ''V'' is in Φ
:# if ''U'' is in Φ, then there exists ''V'' in Φ such that, whenever (''x'', ''y'') and (''y'', ''z'') are in ''V'', then (''x'', ''z'') is in ''U''.

:The elements of Φ are called '''entourages''', and Φ itself is called a '''uniform structure''' on ''U''.

;Uniform structure: See '''[[Uniform space]]'''.

== W ==

; [[Weak topology]]: The [[weak topology]] on a set, with respect to a collection of functions from that set into topological spaces, is the coarsest topology on the set which makes all the functions continuous.
; Weaker topology: See '''[[Coarser topology]]'''. Beware, some authors, especially [[mathematical analysis|analyst]]s, use the term '''stronger topology'''.
; Weakly countably compact: A space is weakly countably compact (or '''limit point compact''') if every [[Infinity|infinite]] subset has a limit point.
; Weakly hereditary: A property of spaces is said to be weakly hereditary if whenever a space has that property, then so does every closed subspace of it. For example, compactness and the Lindelöf property are both weakly hereditary properties, although neither is hereditary.
; Weight: The [[weight of a space]] ''X'' is the smallest [[cardinal number]] κ such that ''X'' has a base of cardinal κ. (Note that such a cardinal number exists, because the entire topology forms a base, and because the class of cardinal numbers is [[well order|well-ordered]].)
; Well-connected: See '''Ultra-connected'''. (Some authors use this term strictly for ultra-connected compact spaces.)

== Z ==

;Zero-dimensional: A space is [[zero-dimensional]] if it has a base of clopen sets.&lt;ref name=ss33&gt;Steen &amp;amp; Seebach (1978) p.33&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Habitus''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|h|æ|b|ɪ|t|ə|s}}) is ingrained habits, skills, and dispositions.  It is the way that individuals perceive the social world around them and react to it. These dispositions are usually shared by people with similar backgrounds (such as [[social class]], religion, nationality, ethnicity, education, profession etc.). The habitus is acquired through imitation (''[[Mimesis|mimesis]]'') and is the reality that individuals are socialized, which includes their individual experience and opportunities. Thus, the habitus represents the way group culture and personal history shape the body and the mind, and as a result, shape present social actions of an individual.&lt;ref&gt;Lizardo, O. 2004, "The cognitive origins of Bourdieu's Habitus", Journal for the Theory of Social Behaviour, vol. 34, no. 4, pp. 375-448.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book|title=Outline of a Theory of Practice|last=Bourdieu|first=Pierre|publisher=Cambridge University Press.|year=1977|isbn=|location=|pages=|via=|newspaper=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pierre Bourdieu]] suggested that the habitus consists of both the ''[[hexis]]'' (the tendency to hold and use one's body in a certain way, such as posture and accent) and more abstract mental habits, schemes of perception, classification, appreciation, feeling, and action.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bourdieu|first=Pierre|title=Pascalian Meditations|newspaper=Stanford University Press.|year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; These schemes are not mere [[habit]]s: Bourdieu suggested they allow individuals to find new solutions to new situations without calculated deliberation, based on their gut feelings and intuitions, which Bourdieu believed were collective and socially shaped. These attitudes, mannerisms, tastes, moral intuitions and habits have influence on the individual's life chances, so the habitus not only is structured by an individual's objective past position in the [[social structure]] but also structures the individual's future life path. Pierre Bourdieu argued that the reproduction of the social structure results from the habitus of individuals (Bourdieu, 1987).

The notion of habitus is extremely influential (with 400,000 Google Scholar publications using it), yet it also evoked criticism for its alleged determinism, as Bourdieu compared social actors to ''automata'' (while relying on [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz's]] theory of [[Monadology|Monads]]).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Origins ==
The concept of habitus has been used as early as [[Aristotle]] but in contemporary usage was introduced by [[Marcel Mauss]] and later [[Maurice Merleau-Ponty]]. However, it was [[Pierre Bourdieu]] who turned it into a cornerstone of his sociology, and used it to address the sociological problem of [[Agency (sociology)|agency]] and structure: the habitus is shaped by structural position and generates action, thus when people act and demonstrate agency they simultaneously reflect and reproduce social structure. Bourdieu elaborated his theory of the habitus while borrowing ideas on cognitive and generative schemes from [[Noam Chomsky]] and [[Jean Piaget]] dependency on history and human memory. For instance, a certain behaviour or belief becomes part of a society's structure when the original purpose of that behaviour or belief can no longer be recalled and becomes socialized into individuals of that culture.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Community and society|last=Tönnies|first=Ferdinand|publisher=Harper and Row.|year=1963|isbn=|location=New York, NY:|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Loïc Wacquant]] wrote that habitus is an old philosophical notion, originating in the thought of [[Aristotle]], whose notion of ''[[hexis]]'' ("state") was translated into ''habitus'' by the Medieval [[Scholastics]].  Bourdieu first adapted the term in his 1967 postface to [[Erwin Panofsky]]'s ''Gothic Architecture and Scholasticism''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brynmawr.edu/bmrcl/Winter2007/Premodern.htm Review] of Holsinger, ''The Premodern Condition'', in ''Bryn Mawr Review of Comparative Literature'' 6:1 (Winter 2007).&lt;/ref&gt;  The term was earlier used in sociology by [[Norbert Elias]] in ''[[The Civilizing Process]]'' (1939) and in [[Marcel Mauss]]'s account of "body techniques" (techniques du corps).  The concept is also present in the work of [[Max Weber]], [[Gilles Deleuze]], and [[Edmund Husserl]].

Mauss defined habitus as those aspects of culture that are anchored in the body or daily practices of individuals, groups, societies, and nations.  It includes the totality of learned [[Habit (psychology)|habits]], bodily skills, styles, tastes, and other non-discursive knowledges that might be said to "go without saying" for a specific group (Bourdieu 1990:66-67)—in that way it can be said to operate beneath the level of rational [[ideology]].

According to Bourdieu, habitus is composed of:

{{quote|[s]ystems of durable, transposable dispositions, structured structures predisposed to function as structuring structures, that is, as principles which generate and organize practices and representations that can be objectively adapted to their outcomes without presupposing a conscious aiming at ends or an express mastery of the operations necessary in order to attain them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bourdieu|first=Pierre|title=The Logic of Practice|newspaper=Polity Press.|year=1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Non-sociological uses==

=== Literary criticism ===
The term has also been adopted in literary criticism, adapting from Bourdieu's usage of the term. For example, Joe Moran's examination of authorial identities in ''Star Authors: Literary Celebrity in America'' uses the term in discussion of how authors develop a habitus formed around their own celebrity and status as authors, which manifests in their writing.

=== Use in literary theory ===
Bourdieu's principle of habitus is interwoven with the concept of structuralism in literary theory. Peter Barry explains, "in the structuralist approach to literature there is a constant movement away from interpretation of the individual literary work and a parallel drive towards understanding the larger structures which contain them" (2009, p.&amp;nbsp;39). There is therefore a strong desire to understand the larger influencing factors which makes an individual literary work. As Bourdieu explains, habitus "are structured structures, generative principles of distinct and distinctive practices – what the worker eats, and especially the way he eats it, the sport he practices and the way he practices it, his political opinions and the way he expresses them are systematically different from the industrial proprietor's corresponding activities / habitus are also structuring structures, different classifying schemes classification principles, different principles of vision and division, different tastes. Habitus make different differences; they implement distinctions between what is good and what is bad, what is right and what is wrong, between what is distinguished and what is vulgar, and so on, but they are not the same. Thus, for instance, the same behaviour or even the same good can appear distinguished to one person, pretentious to someone else, and cheap or showy to yet another" (Bourdieu, 1996). As a result, habitus may be employed in literary theory in order to understand those larger, external structures which influence individual theories and works of literature.

=== Body habitus ===
Body habitus (or "bodily habitus") is the medical term for physique, and is categorized as either endomorphic (relatively short and stout), ectomorphic (relatively long and thin) or mesomorphic (average dimensions). In this sense, habitus has in the past been interpreted as the physical and constitutional characteristics of an individual, especially as related to the tendency to develop a certain disease.&lt;ref&gt;''The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language'' (4th Ed) Houghton Mifflin Company, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; For example, "[[marfan syndrome|Marfanoid]] bodily habitus".

* Bernard Lahire – a French sociologist who suggested that the habitus is not (or no longer) a system shared by a class, but rather an eclectic set of dispositions that are often contradictory, due to non-typical socialization paths in late modernity.&lt;ref&gt;Lahire, Bernard. 2011. The Plural Actor. Cambridge: Polity.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Gabriel Ignatow explored how the notion of habitus can contribute to the sociology of morality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Why the Sociology of Morality Needs Bourdieu's Habitus|last=Ignatow|first=Gabriel|publisher=|year=2009|isbn=|location=|pages=|via=|newspaper=Sociological Inquiry 79:98–114}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Philippe Bourgois]] – an anthropologist who incorporates the concept of "habitus" into much of his work with injection drug users in the San Francisco Bay Area.
* [[Saba Mahmood]] – an anthropologist who suggested that the habitus can be shaped and transformed not only through unconscious mimesis but also through pedagogic process, whole reverting from Bourdieu's account to that of Aristotle.

'''Honesty''' is a [[facet]] of [[moral character]] that connotes positive and [[virtue|virtuous]] attributes such as [[integrity]], [[truth]]fulness, straightforwardness, including straightforwardness of conduct, along with the absence of lying, cheating, theft, etc. Honesty also involves being trustworthy, [[Loyalty|loyal]], [[wikt:fair#Adjective|fair]], and [[Sincerity|sincere]].

Honesty is valued in many ethnic and religious cultures.&lt;ref&gt;Rogers, Carl R. (1964.) "Toward a modern approach to values: The valuing process in the mature person.", ''The Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology'', 68(2):160-7.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dahlsgaard, Katherine; Peterson, Christopher; Seligman, Martin E. P. (2005.) "Shared Virtue: The Convergence of Valued Human Strengths Across Culture and History", ''Review of General Psychology'', 9(3):203-13.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hilbig, Benjamin E.; Zettler, Ingo. (2009.) "Pillars of cooperation: Honesty–Humility, social value orientations, and economic behavior", ''Journal of Research in Personality'', 43(3):516-9.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Van Lange, Paul A. M.; Kuhlman, D. Michael. (1994.) "Social value orientations and impressions of partner's honesty and intelligence: A test of the might versus morality effect", ''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology'', 67(1):126-141.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schluter, Dolph; Price, Trevor. (1993.) "Honesty, Perception and Population Divergence in Sexually Selected Traits", ''Proceedings of the Royal Society B'', 253(1336):117-22.&lt;/ref&gt;
"Honesty is the best policy" is a [[proverb]] of [[Benjamin Franklin]], while the quote "Honesty is the first chapter in the book of [[wisdom]]" is attributed to [[Thomas Jefferson]], as used in a letter to  [[Nathaniel Macon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=mtj1&amp;fileName=mtj1page051.db&amp;recNum=211 |work=The Thomas Jefferson Papers Series 1. General Correspondence. 1651-1827 |title= Thomas Jefferson to Nathaniel Macon |date=January 12, 1819}}&lt;/ref&gt; April 30 is national [[Honesty Day]] in the [[United States]].

[[William Shakespeare]] famously describes honesty as an attribute people leave behind when he wrote that "no legacy is so rich as honesty" in act 3 scene 5 of "[[All's Well that Ends Well]]."&lt;ref name="shakespeare"&gt;William Shakespeare. [http://shakespeare.mit.edu/allswell/allswell.3.5.html All's Well That Ends Well] MIT Shakespeare.&lt;/ref&gt;

Others have noted, however, that "[t]oo much honesty might be seen as undisciplined openness".&lt;ref&gt;Barbara MacKinnon, Andrew Fiala, ''Ethics: Theory and Contemporary Issues, Concise Edition'' (2015), p. 93.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, individuals may be perceived as being "too honest" if they honestly express the negative [[opinion]]s of others, either without having been asked their opinion, or having been asked in a circumstance where the response would be trivial.

==Definitions==
[[Merriam-Webster]] defines honesty as "fairness and straightforwardness of conduct" or "adherence to the facts."&lt;ref name="merriamwebster"&gt;Merriam-Webster (2017) [https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/honesty Honesty] Merriam-Webster.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Oxford English Dictionary]] defines honesty as "the quality of being honest."&lt;ref name="oed1"&gt;Oxford English Dictionary (2017) [https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/honesty Honesty] OED.&lt;/ref&gt; Honest is, in turn, defined as "Free of deceit; truthful and sincere...Morally correct or virtuous...(attributive) Fairly earned, especially through hard work...(of an action) done with good intentions even if unsuccessful or misguided...(attributive) Simple, unpretentious, and unsophisticated.&lt;ref name="oed2"&gt;Oxford English Dictionary (2017) [https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/honest Honest] OED.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11877">'''Institutional logic''' is a core concept in  [[sociological theory]] and [[organizational studies]]. It focuses on how broader belief systems shape the [[cognition]] and behavior of actors.&lt;ref&gt;Friedland &amp; Alford, 1991; [[Michael Lounsbury|Lounsbury]], 2007; Thornton, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

Friedland and Alford (1991) defined Institutions as "both supraorganizational patterns of activity by which individuals and organizations produce and reproduce their material subsistence and organize time and space. They are also symbolic systems, ways of ordering reality, thereby rendering experience of time and space meaningful".&lt;ref&gt;Friedland, Roger, and Robert R. Alford.  1991.  Bringing Society Back in: Symbols, Practices, and Institutional Contradictions.  Pp. 232-266 in The New Institutionalism in Organizational Analysis, edited by Walter W. Powell and Paul J. DiMaggio. Chicago: University of Chicago Press. p. 243.&lt;/ref&gt; Thornton and Ocasio (1999: 804) define institutional logics as "the socially constructed, historical patterns of material practices, assumptions, values, beliefs, and rules by which individuals produce and reproduce their material subsistence, organize time and space, and provide meaning to their social reality".&lt;ref&gt;Thornton, Patricia, H. and William Ocasio (2008). “Institutional Logics,” in Royston Greenwood, Christine Oliver, Kerstin Sahlin and Roy Suddaby (eds.) Handbook of Organizational Institutionalism, CA: Sage.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
Focusing on macro-[[societal]] phenomena, Friedland and Alford (1991: 232) identified several key Institutions: the [[Capitalist]] market, [[bureaucratic]] state, [[democracy]], [[nuclear family]], and [[Christianity]] that are each guided by a distinct institutional logic. Thornton (2004) revised Friedland and Alford’s (1991) inter-institutional scheme to six institutional orders, i.e., the market, the corporation, the professions, the state, the family, and religions. More recently, Thornton, Ocasio and Lounsbury (2012), in more fully fleshing out the institutional logic perspective, added community as another key institutional order. This revision to a theoretically abstract and analytically distinct set of ideal types makes it useful for studying multiple logics in conflict and consensus, the hybridization of logics, and institutions in other parts of society and the world. While building on Friedland and Alford’s scheme, the revision addresses the confusion created by conflating institutional sectors with ideology (democracy) and means of organization (bureaucracy), variables that can be characteristic several different institutional sectors. The institutional logic of Christianity leaves out other religions in the US and other religions that are dominant in other parts of the world. Thornton and Ocasio (2008) discuss the importance of not confusing the ideal types of the inter-institutional system with a description of the empirical observations in a study—that is to use the ideal types as meta theory and method of analysis.

== New institutionalism ==
[[Organizational theorist]]s operating within the [[new institutionalism]] (see also [[institutional theory]]) have begun to develop the institutional logics concept by empirically testing it. One variant emphasizes how logics can focus the attention of key decision-makers on a particular set of issues and solutions (Ocasio, 1997), leading to logic-consistent decisions (Thornton, 2002).  A fair amount of research on logics has focused on the importance of dominant logics and shifts from one logic to another (e.g., Lounsbury, 2002; Thornton, 2002; Suddaby &amp; Greenwood, 2005).  Haveman and Rao (1997) showed how the rise of Progressive thought enabled a shift in savings and loan organizational forms in the U.S. in the early 20th century.  Scott et al. (2000) detailed how logic shifts in healthcare led to the valorization of different actors, behaviors and governance structures.  Thornton and Ocasio (1999) analyzed how a change from professional to market logics in U.S. higher education publishing led to corollary changes in how executive succession was carried out.

While much earlier work focused on ambiguity as a result of multiple and conflicting institutional logics, at the levels of analysis of society and individual roles,&lt;ref&gt;(Boltanski and Thevenot ([1986] 1991)&lt;/ref&gt; Friedland and Alford (1991:248-255) discussed in theory multiple and competing logics at the macro level of analysis. Recent empirical research, inspired by the work of [[Pierre Bourdieu|Bourdieu]], is developing a more pluralistic approach by focusing on multiple competing logics and contestation of meaning.&lt;ref&gt;(Lounsbury, 2007; Marquis &amp; Lounsbury, 2007; Schneiberg, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;  By focusing on how some fields are composed of multiple logics, and thus, multiple forms of institutionally-based rationality, institutional analysts can provide new insight into practice variation and the dynamics of practice.&lt;ref&gt;(see Lounsbury, 2001; Lounsbury &amp; Crumley, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;  Multiple logics can create diversity in practice by enabling variety in cognitive orientation and contestation over which practices are appropriate.  As a result, such multiplicity can create enormous ambiguity, leading to logic blending, the creation of new logics, and the continued emergence of new practice variants.  Thornton, Jones, and Kury (2005) showed how competing logics may never resolve but share the market space as in the case of architectural services.

Recent research has also documented the co-existence or potential conflict of multiple logics within particular organizations. Zilber (2002), for example, described the organizational consequences of a shift from one logic to another within an Israeli rape crisis center, in which new organization members reshaped the center and its practices to reflect a new dominant logic that they have carried into the organization.&lt;ref&gt;Zilber, T. B. (2002). "Institutionalization as an Interplay between Actions, Meanings, and Actors: The Case of a Rape Crisis Center in Israel." Academy of Management Journal, 45(1), 234-254.&lt;/ref&gt; Tilcsik (2010) documented a logic shift in a post-Communist government agency, describing a conflict between the agency's old guard (carriers of the logic of Communist state bureaucracies) and its new guard (carriers of a market logic). This study shows that, paradoxically, an intra-organizational group's efforts to resist a particular logic might in fact open the organization's door to carriers of that very logic.&lt;ref&gt;Tilcsik, A. (2010). "From ritual to reality: Demography, ideology, and decoupling in a post-communist government agency." Academy of Management Journal, 53(6), 1474-1498. [http://ssrn.com/abstract=1494035 Abstract]&lt;/ref&gt; Almandoz (2012) examined the embeddedness of new local banks' founding teams in a community logic or a financial logic, linking institutional logics to new banking venture's establishment and entrepreneurial success.&lt;ref&gt;Almandoz, J. (2012). "Arriving at the Starting Line: The Impact of Community and Financial Logics on New Banking Ventures." Academy of Management Journal.&lt;/ref&gt; As these studies demonstrate, the institutional logics perspective offers valuable insights into important intra-organizational processes affecting organizational practices, change, and success. These studies represent an effort to understand institutional complexity due to conflicting or inconsistent logics within particular organizations, a situation that might results from the entry of new organization members or the layering (or "sedimentation") of new organizational imprints upon old ones over time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Marquis|first=Christopher|last2=Tilcsik|first2=András|date=2013-06-01|title=Imprinting: Toward a Multilevel Theory|url=http://annals.aom.org/content/7/1/195|journal=Academy of Management Annals|language=en|volume=7|issue=1|pages=195–245|doi=10.1080/19416520.2013.766076|issn=1941-6520|citeseerx=10.1.1.728.6149}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==JDWC® Redefining Cotillion for the 21st Century==
Over the last 65 years Jon D. Williams Cotillions® has redefined the term cotillion by rendering the traditional 'formal ball' to be applicable in the 21st century. In a world where kindness and civility are often overlooked it is the increasingly important responsibility of cotillion to be the forum where young people interact with one another. Jon D. Williams Cotillions® has effectively redefined cotillion "as a group of young people assembled to develop, appreciate and respect their role in society through social skills and dance education" (Jon D. Williams III).

JDWSEP® has a rich history behind its over 65 years in the field of social skills and dance education. The company’s founders, [[Jon and Vivian Williams]], met in 1932. Jon Williams left medical school for the opportunity to study dance with [[Arthur Murray]] where he was advised to begin working with a talented blonde debutante named Vivian. Thus began the illustrious career of [[Jon and Vivian Williams]] as the number one national instructional team of [[Arthur Murray]]. Soon the perfect dance partners became partners in life and were married. After World War II, Jon was contacted by [[Fred Astaire]] and offered the position of setting up Fred Astaire Studios across the country. In 1949, now having a family and ready to settle down, the Williams decided to leave Astaire and establish their home and a new business in [[Colorado Springs, Colorado]]. Thus was born the first Jon D. Williams Cotillion® at the world-famous [[Broadmoor Hotel]]. [[JDW Social Education Programs]]® have established and incomparable reputation across the nation, with [[Jon D. Williams III]], son of the founder and president of the organization, now leading the next generation.

==Main facets==

Foiskett and Foskett observe: "The basic idea of facets is separate grouping of each major division of a subject.".&lt;ref name="LEC" /&gt;  Using the [[British Education Index]] and the [[British National Bibliography]], they divided educational terms into groups that are mutually exclusive.  This forms the foundation of the classification sequence.

In the LEC main facets are indicated by a capital letter, and terms in facets by lower case letters.  Letters are arranged so that vowels and consonants alternate, so that the eventual notation will appear as a syllable.&lt;ref name="LEC" /&gt;  e.g.

'''Margaret Crittendon Douglass''' (born 1822; year of death unknown) was a  [[Southern United States|Southern]] white woman  who served one month in jail in 1854 for teaching free black children to read in [[Norfolk, Virginia]].  Refusing to hire a defense attorney, she defended herself in court and later published a book about her experiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite Appletons|wstitle = Douglass, Margaret Crittenden}}&lt;/ref&gt; The case drew public attention to the [[Education during the Slave Period|highly restrictive laws against black literacy]] in the [[Antebellum South|pre-Civil War American South]].&lt;ref&gt;Douglass, Margaret,  Educational Laws of Virginia: The Personal Narrative of  Mrs. Margaret Douglass, a Southern Woman Who Was Imprisoned for One Month in the Common Jail of Norfolk, John P. Jewett and Co., 1854&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Davison Lawson, John, American State Trials: A Collection of the Important and Interesting Criminal Trials which Have Taken Place in the United States, from the Beginning of Our Government to the Present Day : with Notes and Annotations, Volume 7, Thomas Law Book Company, 1914,&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Douglass was born  in 1822 in [[Washington, D.C.]], but moved in her childhood to [[Charleston, South Carolina]], where she married. By age fourteen, she had given birth to a daughter, Hannah Rosa.&lt;ref&gt;[http://search.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/sse.dll?gss=angs-g&amp;new=1&amp;rank=1&amp;msT=1&amp;gsfn=Margaret&amp;gsfn_x=0&amp;gsln=Douglass&amp;gsln_x=0&amp;mswpn__ftp=Norfolk%2c+Independent+Cities%2c+Virginia%2c+USA&amp;mswpn=24283&amp;mswpn_PInfo=8-%7c0%7c1652393%7c0%7c2%7c3245%7c49%7c0%7c24255%7c24283%7c0%7c&amp;MSAV=1&amp;msbdy=1822&amp;cp=0&amp;catbucket=rstp&amp;uidh=r94&amp;pcat=ROOT_CATEGORY&amp;h=15375122&amp;db=1850usfedcenancestry&amp;indiv=1&amp;ml_rpos=1 Margaret Douglass, Hannah Rosa Douglass, 1850 Census, Norfolk, Virginia, www. ancestry.com]&lt;/ref&gt;  She also birthed a son, who died. Nothing is known about her husband. In 1845, she and her daughter relocated to Norfolk, Virginia, where she established herself in a modest apartment in a tenement neighborhood and made ends meet by running her own business as a seamstress and vest maker. She chose not to participate in social activities with her white neighbors in the nearby tenements, who she felt were "not of the most refined class". She notes in her memoir that this made her unpopular in the neighborhood. She described her life as "frugal and retiring", and that it was "necessary for me to labor incessantly".&lt;ref&gt;Douglass, Margaret, The Personal Narrative of Mrs. Margaret Douglass, a Southern Woman Who Was Imprisoned for One Month in the Common Jail of Norfolk, John P. Jewett and Co., 1854 p.6-9&lt;/ref&gt;

==The school==
In 1853 she paid a business visit to the [[barber]] shop of a free black man named Robinson.  Mr. Robinson was  a man of influence in the community  of  more than 1500 [[Free negro|free people of color]] who lived in Norfolk at that time.&lt;ref&gt;John Henderson Russell, The Free Negro in Virginia, 1619-1865 (Baltimore, Md.: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1913), 57-58. [https://familysearch.org/learn/wiki/en/Virginia_African_Americans#Free_People_of_Colo Digital version] at [https://archive.org/details/freenegro00russrich Internet Archiv].&lt;/ref&gt;  His two young sons were busy studying a [[Primer (textbook)|reading primer]], so Douglass asked Robinson if there wasn't a school in town where free black children could learn to read.  Robinson said  that there was only the Sunday school at Christ Church  where, he said, "they didn't learn much."  Douglass returned home and asked her teenaged daughter, Hannah Rosa, if she would like to tutor the boys.  Hannah Rosa said she would, and the boys began to receive free reading lessons at the Douglass home, using the books they received at church. Eventually, Robiinson took his sons back to the barber shop where he needed their help, and sent his two daughters instead. In her memoir, Douglass states that the two girls were intelligent, attentive, made rapid progress, and were "a source of pleasure to us."

A month later, Margaret and Hannah Rosa decided to open a small school for free black children in their home, and  charge three dollars per student per quarter. Robinson spread word to the free black community, and the school was deluged with applications. For 11 months, they taught 25 children, who Douglass described as "well-behaved" and "anxious to be taught".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/aia/part4/4h2945.html|title=Mrs. Margaret Douglass|website=www.pbs.org|access-date=2017-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; When one of her female students grew ill, Douglass made regular visits to her home, and  arranged for and participated in the girl's funeral  when she died.  This, according to Douglass, was not approved of by other whites in the community.&lt;ref&gt;Douglass,  p.9-11&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arrest ==
On the  morning of May 9, 1853, while Hannah Rosa and the children were assembled at their desks, two police officers stationed themselves at the front and back door of her house.  They informed Margaret and Hannah Rosa that teaching free black children was illegal under Virginia law, then took the two women and the twenty-five terrified children on foot to the mayor's office.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/exhibits/brown/brown-segregation.html#obj1|title=A Century of Racial Segregation 1849–1950 - Brown v.

"You have a very large family", Mayor Stubbs commented when she and the 25 children arrived at his office. He then asked her if she was aware of the law. Douglass responded that she didn't know teaching free black children was illegal, but that if it were  illegal for her to teach the children it should also be illegal for the church to do it, since she was using the same books. The mayor dismissed the matter and sent everyone home, after assuring Douglass that nothing would happen to the black children or their families.&lt;ref&gt;American State Trials, p. 50&lt;/ref&gt;

Outside the courtroom, Douglass noted that she was met by a group of free black adults, parents of the children and their friends, waiting to hear the decision and offering to pay for any penalties or bail she might incur. 
She gathered the children back at the school, gave them back their books and slates, and said goodbye. "It was a sad parting", she wrote in her memoir.&lt;ref&gt;Douglass, p.20&lt;/ref&gt;

After her daughter Hannah Rosa left Norfolk for New York on  June 29, Douglas was left alone, receiving however frequent gifts of flowers from her former students who stopped by to see her.

Of the outpouring of support she received from the black community. Douglas writes, "In my opinion, those who call the Southern Negroes ungrateful are only those who never do anything to call forth that emotion....May I ask what gratitude they owe to those who would degrade them?  What gratitude does that child owe to his own father, who would coldly sell  him as  a slave?"&lt;ref&gt;Douglass, p. 14–20&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trial==
Although she thought the case was now behind her, on July 13, she was served legal papers for a [[Grand jury|Grand Jury Indictment]] for her and her 17-year-old daughter, which stated: "Each of them did unlawfully assemble with diver negros, for the purpose of instructing them to read and to write, and did instruct them to read and to write, contrary to the act of the General Assembly, in such case made and provided, and against the peace and dignity of the Commonwealth of Virginia'.&lt;ref&gt;American State Trials, p.49&lt;/ref&gt;

Having little money and 'little affection for lawyers', Douglass decided to defend herself. She did not mention the upcoming trial to her daughter, who was still in New York, until September 1, when she instructed her to stay until further notice. On November 11, she entered the crowded courtroom alone, wearing a black velvet dress, white kid gloves and a plain straw bonnet. 'Everyone present seemed to be confused, except myself,' she noted.&lt;ref&gt;Douglass, p. 22&lt;/ref&gt;

She called three male members of Christ's Church as her witnesses, two of them also lawyers, one who had signed the summons against her. The excitement in the courtroom when these three witnesses arrived was 'most intense', she noted. In her memoir, she states that these men, who she describes as part of the 'aristocracy' of Norfolk, were either lecturers at the church's Sunday school, or had wives and daughters who were, and had given the free black children of the community the same books she was using to teach them to read. The witnesses either denied teaching altogether or said they had only provided moral and religious instruction, but did not teach the black children how to read and write.

In her closing speech to the jury, Douglass described herself as a Southern woman, a former slave-holder. She said she was not against [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]], and strongly opposed to northern [[abolitionist]] interference, though she believed their 'principles are based on a religious foundation'. She believed, she said, in 'the duty of every Southerner, morally and religiously to instruct his slaves, that they may know their duties to their masters and their common God. Let the masters first do their duty to them, for they are still our slaves and servants, whether bond or free, and can be nothing else in our community.' She also challenged the indifference of the white population towards the situation of the free and enslaved black population, where there was misery, starvation, and harsh laws in place to control them, noting that it was illegal for more than two or three of them to assemble in one place, for whatever reason.

'When they are sick, or in want, on whom does the duty devolve to seek them out and administer to their necessities? Does it fall upon you, gentlemen? Oh no, it is not expected that gentlemen will take the trouble to seek out a negro hut for the purpose of alleviating the wretchedness he may find within it. Why then persecute your benevolent ladies for doing that which you yourselves have so long neglected? Shall we treat our slaves with less compassion than we do the cattle in the field?"

She also told the jury that although they had nothing to fear from the 'true blooded' negroes, she felt that those who had 'white blood in their veins' were 'presumptuous, treacherous, and revengeful.' "Ask how that white blood got beneath those tawny skins," she suggested, "and let nature herself account for the exhibition of these instincts. Blame the authors of this devilish mischief, but not the victims of it."

In closing, she offered that she was willing to go to prison if she had to, but that the black anti-literacy law, she said, was 'one of the most inhuman and unjust laws that ever disgraced the statute book of a civilized community.' &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.civilwarwomenblog.com/margaret-douglass/|title=Margaret Douglass – Civil War Women|website=www.civilwarwomenblog.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;American State Trials, p. 50&lt;/ref&gt;

When she rested her case, the judge asked if anyone wanted to speak in her favor. No one came forward.

Douglass successfully argued for dropping the charges against Hannah Rosa, since she was still a minor. At the close of the trial, the jury deliberated for two days, found her guilty, and fined her one dollar. She then left for New York to retrieve her daughter.

==Sentencing and jail==
On January 10, 1854, she was called back before Judge Baker for further sentencing.

The Judge noted that some people in Norfolk were opposed to the law, and chided her for 'the indiscreet freedom with which you spoke of the colored race in general'. 'Such opinions I regard as manifestly mischievous', he said. The Church officials, he said, were allowed to instruct the children because religious instruction is necessary for black people. Black literacy, however, is dangerous. He described the law as a "matter of self-defense against Northern anti-slavery agitators who clog the mail with anti-slavery pamphlets to be distributed among Southern Negroes to induce them to cut our throats," and who "scattered pocket handkerchiefs around with anti-slavery engravings to work upon the feelings and ignorance of our negroes, who otherwise would remain comfortable and happy". He also admonished her for speaking directly and honestly in her own defense instead of hiring an attorney, which would have allowed her case to have been presented in a 'far more favorable light'. Her 'bold and open opposition', he said, 'is a matter not to be slightly regarded' and 'something more substantial is required in this case'.

'For these reasons', he continued, 'as an example to all others in like cases disposed to offend, and in vindication of the policy and justness of our laws, which every individual should be taught to respect, the judgment of the Court is, in addition to the proper fine and costs, that you be imprisoned for the period of one month in the jail of this city'.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/aia/part4/4h2945t.html The Case of Mrs. Margaret Douglass, Africans in America, PBS.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

Douglass served out her sentence. Having no where else to stay when she was released, the jailer and his wife put her up for two days before she moved with her daughter to Philadelphia.

==Media coverage==
The case received substantial media coverage at the time, both for and against Douglass and the anti-literacy law. Under the headline "Her Own Lawyer," an editor in the ''Petersburg Daily Express'' wrote of how the courtroom was 'filled with persons anxious to witness the novel spectacle' of a woman defending herself and compared her speech making abilities to renowned feminists like [[Lucy Stone]].&lt;ref&gt;Her Own Lawyer, Petersburg Daily Express, 1853, cited in Douglass&lt;/ref&gt;  Despite her disavowal of abolitionism,  she was hailed as a heroine by abolitionists. [[William Lloyd Garrison]], in his abolitionist newspaper, ''The Liberator'',  noted that a Quaker woman in Norfolk had delivered a sermon on Douglass' behalf while Douglass was in jail and stated, "The women are a great trouble to our Norfolk neighbors", he said. "If they want peace, they will have to expel all Christian women... from the city."  &lt;ref&gt;Garrison, William LLoyd, The Liberator, November, 1853, cited in ''Religion and the Antebellum Debate Over Slavery'', John McKivigan, Mitchell Snay  University of Georgia Press, p. 187&lt;/ref&gt;

The editor of the Virginia newspaper ''The Argus'' wrote that although the Norfolk community was reluctant to put a white woman in prison, 'there rose a righteous indignation towards a person who would throw contempt in the face of our laws, and brave the imprisonment for 'the cause of humanity' '.

'Let her depart hence with only one wish, that her presence will never be intruded upon us again. Let her seek her associates at the North, and with them commingle, but let us put a check to such mischievous views as fell from her lips last November, sentiments unworthy of a resident of the State, and in direct rebellion against our Constitution", he wrote.

In the religious publication ''Covenanter: Devoted to the Principles of the Reformed Presbyterian Church'', (Volume 9, 1853) David Smith called upon the Presbyterian General Assembly to intercede with the U.S. government to "secure for all its citizens the rights of teaching human beings to read the language of their country..." He noted that the United States government had interceded when Presbyterian women had been imprisoned in foreign Catholic countries for passing out Bibles, but would not intervene in Douglas's case.

The case, Smith said, has "exposed the country to the contempt and hissing of every  civilized country on earth".&lt;ref&gt;''Covenanter, Devoted to the Principles of the Reformed Presbyterian Church,'' Volume 9, 1853&lt;/ref&gt;

==Memoir and legacy==
In 1854, Douglass published her memoir of the event, ''Educational Laws of Virginia: The Personal Narrative of Mrs. Margaret Douglass, a Southern Woman, who was Imprisoned for One Month in the Common Jail of Norfolk, Under the Laws of Virginia, for the Crime of Teaching Free Colored Children to Read.'' In it, she describes the trial as well as the events that led up to it, and includes the speech she made in her own self-defense.  As she did in her courtroom speech, she criticizes the black literacy and assembly laws as well as white indifference to the situation of blacks, but identifies herself as a Southern supporter of slavery, and a [[white supremacist]]:

"I have been a slaveholder myself, and, if circumstances rendered it necessary or practicable, I might be such again".&lt;ref&gt;https://archive.org/stream/personalnarrativ1854doug#page/5/mode/1up&lt;/ref&gt;

Pointing out that many of the black and [[mixed race]] children she was teaching were the children of the same white men who aided in the prosecution against her, she lays some of the blame for the condition of black people on Southern white men who sexually abused enslaved black women. This, she believed, is the root of the  anti-literacy law. "How important then for these Southern Sultans that the objects of their criminal passions should be kept in utter ignorance and degradation", she writes. She speaks of the  silent frustration of white women who know of their husbands' 'tawny mistresses' and the powerlessness of black women, who have "parents, brothers, sisters, a lover perhaps, all of whom suffer through and with her, and in whose hearts spring up roots of bitterness which are destined to grow into trees whose branches will sooner or later overshadow the whole land." She ends her memoir calling upon her white "Southern sisters" to  remedy this situation:

"I know my Southern sisters well enough to believe that they will not much longer rest tamely under the influence of this damning curse. I have told them plainly of the evil. The remedy is in their hands".&lt;ref&gt;Douglass&lt;/ref&gt;

Little is known about Margaret Douglass's life after her trial.

In June 1865 the members of the free black community of Norfolk, Virginia petitioned the federal government to abolish the restrictive literacy and assembly laws that were still in place in their community.&lt;ref&gt;http://nationalhumanitiescenter.org/pds/maai2/freedom/text5/equalsuffrage.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The law was abolished in 1867.

Documents and publications about Douglass's trial and her subsequent memoir have helped shed light on the era she lived in for scholars of American history, race relations, women's history, religion and law.&lt;ref&gt;Joshua Rhodes Balme Hamilton, "American States,Churches and Slavery" Adams and Company, 1864&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;: Christopher Lasch, Elisabeth Lasch-Quinn Women and the Common Life: Love, Marriage, and Feminism, W.W. Norton and Co, 1997&lt;/ref&gt; One legal scholar wrote that with the case of Margaret Douglass: "The modern era of Anglo-American Law had arrived early, and the principal actor had been, appropriately, a woman.   Her jury speech had, appropriately, employed the female metaphor of the family, in which all the children deserved equality of treatment. It was a metaphor, and an idea, that would come to dominate the legal discourse of America." &lt;ref&gt;The Life of the Law: The People and Cases that Have Shaped Our Society,  By Alfred H. Knight.  Oxford University Press, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''marked graph''' is a [[Petri net]] in which every place has exactly one incoming arc, and exactly one outgoing arc. This means, that there can ''not'' be ''conflict'', but there can be ''concurrency''. Mathematically: &lt;math&gt;\forall p\in P: |p\bullet|=|\bullet p|=1&lt;/math&gt;. Marked graphs are used mostly to mathematically represent concurrently running operations, such as a multiprocessor machine's internal process state.  This class of Petri nets gets the name from a popular way of representing them: as a graph where each place is an edge and each transition is a node.  

==Uses==
Marked graphs are mainly used to mathematically represent concurrent mechanisms, in order to be able to mathematically derive certain characteristics of the design.

==Example==
[[Image:Marked Graph example1.png|400px|right|Marked Graph example]] 
This example presents a Marked Graph, where a process is [[Fork (operating system)|forked]] at transition T1 and [[Synchronization point#Data_synchronization|synchronised]] at T4. In between, two operations take place in non-deterministic fashion, T2 and T3. In fact, Petri nets are so much non-deterministic, that they may not take place at all. But the reason for having this non-deterministic property is not this, but to mimic real-life experiences which shows that parallel computing always means that it is impossible to determine which process/thread will finish first i.e. which operation(s) will execute faster. This can be due to waiting for [[Input/Output|I/O]] in real world, or just the different parameters given to the processes/threads.

Commonly called '''new media theory''' or '''media-centered theory''' of [[Composition studies|composition]], media theory focuses on how writing is created, keeping in mind particularly the tools and mediums used in the composition process. New media refers to a range of digital modes of communication, often incorporating a multi-modal mix of the visual or oral in addition to traditional text. Stemming from the rise of [[computers]] as [[word processing]] tools, media theorists now also examine the rhetorical strengths and weakness of different media, and the implications these have for [[literacy]], [[author]], and reader.

==New media defined==
The meaning of the term 'new media' can be confusing and debated over. At times extended to mean any sort of media that is not purely written-text-based, it generally refers to any medium that is technologically 'advanced' from pure text. The broadness of the term is useful in that it allows for the multiple modes that can be encompassed by this definition, instead of being focused on the technical aspect that the term 'digital' would invite. With this in mind, though, terms like 'digital', 'hyper-textual', 'interactive', 'simulated', 'virtual', and 'networked' can often be helpful when thinking about what constitutes new media.&lt;ref&gt;Liser, Martin; Dovey, Jon; Giddons, Seth; Grant, Iaian; &amp; Kelly, Kieran. New Media: A Critical Introduction, Second Ed. London: Routledge, 2008. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; However, there is often a false dichotomy drawn between the 'analogue' media and the 'new' media; media theory invites re-mediation of texts, which often result in a mix of mediums.&lt;ref&gt;Bolter, Jay David and Grusin, Richard. Remediation: Understanding New Media. Cambridge: MIT, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; Gunther Kress remarks on the new responsibilities of writers:
"In the new theory of representation, in the present technological context of electronic, multimodal, multimedia textual production, the task of text-makers is that of complex orchestration. Further, individuals are now seen as remakers, transformers, of sets of representational resources... ."&lt;ref&gt;Kress, Gunther. "Visual and Verbal Modes of Representation in Electronically Mediated Communication: The Potentials of New Forms of Text." Page to Screen: Taking Literacy into the Electronic Age. Ed Ilana Snyder. London: Routledge, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theoretical construct==
Noted scholar in the field, Cynthia Selfe has frequently commented on the exigency of incorporating new media in the writing classroom, noting its ability to make students rhetorically aware of the arguments that they commonly take for granted based on medium. She states,
"Composition teachers, language arts teachers, and other literacy specialists need to recognize that the relevance of technology in the English studies disciplines is not simply a matter of helping students work effectively with communication software and hardware, but, rather, also a matter of helping them to understand and to be able to assess – to pay attention to – the social, economic, and pedagogical implications of new communication technologies and technological initiatives that affect their lives." &lt;ref&gt;Selfe, Cynthia L. (1999) "Technology and literacy: A story about the perils of not paying attention" College Composition and Communication, 50(3).&lt;/ref&gt;

Richard Ohmann extends this argument, saying, "Adults ignorant of computers will soon be as restricted as those who today are unable to read. Software will become the language of the future, and the dominant intellectual asset of the human race, so that an understanding of software will be a primary component of literacy in the electronic age".&lt;ref&gt;Ohmann, Richard. "Literacy, Technology, and Monopoly Capital" Cross Talk In Comp Theory: A Reader. Ed. Victor Villanueva &amp; Kristin L. Arola. Urbana: NCTE, 2011. 699–716. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Holding intersections with rhetorical theory, new media theory focuses on how different mediums work rhetorically within various contexts. It subscribes to [[Marshall McLuhan]]'s coined phrase "[[the medium is the message]]", or rather, that a message's content is just as important as the medium that delivers it in affecting how the message is received. A large amount of new media theory's focus is also on how different mediums generate different thinking; the theory proposes that new mediums produce specific (often unique) rhetorical moves like multi-threaded thought processes through the use of interactive texts.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, Stephen. "[[Everything Bad Is Good for You: How Today's Popular Culture Is Actually Making Us Smarter]]." New York City: Riverhead Trade, 2005. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Related to this, patterns of organization and production are topics of emphasis for new media theory, especially when thinking about the commonly non-sequential or thinking and writing of new media, particularly through the use of [[hyperlinks]]. Gunther Kress says about the complexity of new media composition, "But this one person now has to understand the semiotic potentials of each mode–sound, visual, speech–and orchestrate them to accord with his or her design. Multimedia production requires high levels of competence based on knowledge of the operation of different modes, and highly developed design abilities to produce complex semiotic "texts."&lt;ref&gt;Kress, Gunther. "Visual and Verbal Modes of Representation in Electronically Mediated Communication: The Potentials of New Forms of Text." Page to Screen: Taking Literacy into the Electronic Age. Ed Ilana Snyder. London: Routledge, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

 
Media theory focuses on the effects that can come from utilizing new media, like new textual experiences and new ways of representing the world. One effect is the changing relationship between subjects and technologies, especially in relation to [[Identity (social science)|identity]] and [[community]].&lt;ref&gt;Liser, Martin; Dovey, Jon; Giddons, Seth; Grant, Iaian; &amp; Kelly, Kieran. New Media: A Critical Introduction, Second Ed. London: Routledge, 2008. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==
The earliest research that can be considered part of media theory involved the use of computers as word processors. However, with the advent of applications like [[HyperCard]] for the Apple Macintosh, the focus in media research shifted to hypertext's implications in the writing classroom.
 
Much research has been done regarding technological literacy, and questions of literacy in general. Richard Ohmann,&lt;ref&gt;Ohmann, R. (2008). Literacy, technology, and monopoly capital. In R. Morris, E. Overman-Smith, &amp; M. Sidler (Eds.), Computers in the Composition Classroom: A Critical Sourcebook (pp. 20–34). Boston, MA: Bedford / St. Martin's.&lt;/ref&gt; as early as 1985, questions the focus on technological literacy appearing in schools at the time. Insisting that technological literacy is tied to socioeconomic class, Ohmann, and others like him began to research the possibility for educational ostracism because of a lack of access to technological tools. This contrasts starkly with much of the utopian visions of the technological classroom that others exhibited.
 
Current research is being conducted multimodal composition, broadening composition to encompass video, video games, music, and other interactive media [[Digital Media]].

==Authorship==
Identity and the construction of such is an area of particular focus for new media theory.&lt;ref&gt;Penrod, Dianne. "Composition in convergence: the impact of new media on writing assessment." Boca Raton: Taylor and Francis Publishing, 2005. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Individuals can control how they are represented online through personalized [[Avatar (computing)|avatars]] and profiles, and the rhetorical moves behind this are often explored. Identity is an important aspect of authorship in many new media writings in this manner, then, especially in situations like [[Internet forums]].
 
Many instances of new media have difficulty controlling authorship, though, and new media theory does not always view this as a bad thing. Digital medias are in a constant state of flux (versus the relative fixity of traditional text) because several transformations may occur. For instance, in the case of [[email]], messages may be replied to or forwarded several times, during which times previous messages may be revised or edited by various parties.&lt;ref&gt;Rice, Jeff. "The rhetoric of cool: composition studies and new media". Carbondale: Southern Illinois University, 2007. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Technologies that allow for simultaneous authoring of texts also produce this effect.
 
Authorship is further complicated by the refashioning of analogue texts or the "[[remixing]]" of several new media texts. Jay Bolter says,
"In the new theory of representation, in the present technological context of electronic, multimodal, multimedia textual production, the task of text-makers is that of complex orchestration. Further, individuals are now seen as remakers, transformers, of sets of representational resources."&lt;ref&gt;Bolter, Jay David and Grusin, Richard. Remediation: Understanding New Media. Cambridge: MIT, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Those involved in new media theories have often needed to redefine "author" in the context of new media. Some theorists draw a difference between the authors of analogue texts as people who produce texts that readers interpret; in contrast, those who produce new media texts are seen as being in better alignment with the term "experience designers", because they create spaces within which readers make their own paths.&lt;ref&gt;Liser, Martin; Dovey, Jon; Giddons, Seth; Grant, Iaian; &amp; Kelly, Kieran. New Media: A Critical Introduction, Second Ed. London: Routledge, 2008. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;  This is particularly true for interactive and immersive texts. This produces even more debate over who is seen as an author, because in many new media texts, the reader plays a dual role of consumer and producer.

==Teaching methods and pedagogical basis==
Media theory focuses on the [[Agency (philosophy)|agency]] that composing in new media can give writers. It is important not to simply add in new media as a problematic addendum to analogue writing; instead,&lt;ref&gt;George, Diana. "From Analysis to Design: Visual Communication in the Teaching of Writing." CCC 54:1 September 2002, 11–39.&lt;/ref&gt; teachers can take advantage of these "new" means by calling students to become both consumers or critics of new media as well as producers, as technology's role in society becomes ever more prominent. Giving students the resources to take part in discourses around and through new media gives them the power and agency to act in this digital world.
 
The agency gained through new media composition also provides a basis for [[social change]]. Gunther Kress remarks on the potential for teaching design via new media composition in the classroom:
Design takes for granted competence in the use of resources, but beyond that it requires the orchestration and remaking of these resources in the services of frameworks and models that express the maker's intentions in shaping the social and cultural environment. While critique looks at the present through the means of past production, design shapes the future through deliberate deployment of representational resources in the designer's interest.&lt;ref&gt;Kress, Gunther. "Visual and Verbal Modes of Representation in Electronically Mediated Communication: The Potentials of New Forms of Text." Page to Screen: Taking Literacy into the Electronic Age. Ed Ilana Snyder. London: Routledge, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Teachers cite the ease of which students pick up on the techniques of composition and analysis of new media. The visually saturated and technologically heavy society of today means that students and writers will need to question the communications and compositions around them as rhetorical moves integral to the culture students live in.&lt;ref&gt;George, Diana. "From Analysis to Design: Visual Communication in the Teaching of Writing." CCC 54:1 September 2002, 11–39.&lt;/ref&gt;  Their familiarity with and knowledge of new media often results in positive, conscious appropriation of media, and opens the door for discussions of repurposing within culture. Jay Bolter and Richard Grusin say:
No medium today, and certainly no single media event, seems to do its cultural work in isolation from other social and economic forces. What is new about new media comes from the particular ways in which they refashion older media and the ways in which older media refashion themselves to answer the challenges of new media.&lt;ref&gt;Bolter, Jay David and Grusin, Richard. Remediation: Understanding New Media. Cambridge: MIT, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
One potentially useful method of teaching composition with media theory in mind is through the use of online classrooms. [[Massive Open Online Course]]s (MOOCs) and [[Online Writing Lab]]s (OWLs) are becoming increasingly popular, especially with [[distance learning]]. These educational formats also typically deal with analogue texts, but provide technologically based resources for this composition process via digital feedback and revision techniques.
 
Media theory has particular potential for teaching basic writers or students whose native language is not English.&lt;ref&gt;Cooper, Arnie. "Teaching Media Literacy in the ESL Classroom." Language Magazine. April 2002. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; As a "literacy" that "translates" better across languages and demographics, new media can serve to engage students who were previously uninterested in composition, as well as allow these students to feel like they have more expertise or agency in the composing process. Furthermore, it allows for more creativity and exploration of rhetorical power in composition as students learn the semiotic power of various modes of discourse through technology.

==Intersections with other composition theories==
Because media theory focuses so much on specific, often technical aspects of writing, it has much room for overlap, and facilitates other theoretical composition pedagogies.

For instance, [[Writing Across the Curriculum]] (commonly known as WAC) focuses on the different ideologies, paradigms, and standards between various disciplines, especially when it comes to writing and how these play out within writing. Thus, WAC recommends an approach to teaching writing that emphasizes these differences and the rhetorical awareness that is needed to write to varying audiences. Media theory works well with WAC because it, too, emphasizes different and multiple literacies. Not only does it emphasize a multi-modal approach to writing, but it also emphasizes the fact that the writer will have to be aware of different audience's familiarity with technology. Furthermore, WAC can easily be combined with media theory because technology and digital writing are becoming more popular in all disciplines, so understanding the differences that come with various fields could potentially interact with the implications of using digital composition instead of traditional print.&lt;ref&gt;Hesse, Doug. "New Media, New Modes, and New Options for Writing Across the Curriculum." NC State. N.d. Presentation.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another theory that media theory is conducive to in composition is [[collaborative learning]] theory. Typically, this theory focuses on the construction of knowledge as a social act.  Media theory aligns well with collaborative learning because, with the advancement of technology, writing can easily accommodate multiple authors.&lt;ref&gt;Alvarez, Claudio; Milrad, Marcelo; Nussbaum, Miguel. "Collboard: Supporting New Media Literacies and Collaborative Learning Using Digital Pens and Interactive Whiteboards." International Conference on Computers in Education. 2010. Malaysia. Conference Presentation.&lt;/ref&gt; This can be exemplified through something as simple as an online forum, in which writers converse through text to come to conclusions. Another example is Wikipedia, the online encyclopedia where authorship is relatively open to the public, so various writers may inform others of their knowledge and build on others' to create a constantly evolving definition and explanation of a certain topic.

Media theory also works well with [[critical pedagogy]] and [[feminist theory in composition|feminist]] theories of composition. These theories challenge traditional notions of hierarchies in relation to certain social groups, like race or gender, and how this affects writing. When in practice, media theory can break down hierarchies in several ways. The first way is tied directly to writing as a product. Critical and feminist theories value texts written in non-traditional ways (for example, narrative essay as a "feminine" writing style versus thesis-driven essay as a "masculine" writing style) and texts written by minorities. Media theory breaks down the hegemony that "pure text" has over other modalities by utilizing "non-traditional" methods and modes of writing through the use of technology.&lt;ref&gt;Landow, George P. Hypertext 3.0: Critical Theory and New Media in an Era of Globalization. Baltimore: JHU Press, 2006. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; The second way media theory in practice breaks down hierarchies is tied to writing as a process. There is a democratization to media theory because everyone is involved in the creation and consumption of a text because of common features like public access and interactivity. In terms of concrete pedagogy, Massively Open Online Classrooms (MOOCs) work to break down hierarchies by encouraging learning in an informal setting with partially anonymous users, which potentially allows for minorities to let their voices be heard without worrying about discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;Collingwood, Sharon; Quintana, Alvina; and Smith, Caroline J. ''Feminist Cyberspaces: Pedagogies in Transition''. Newcastle: Cambridge Scholars Publishing, 2012. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critiques==
A main critique of media theory in practice deals with time constraints. Many First-Year Composition teachers complain that there is not enough time in the course to teach digital writing in addition to "regular" writing. This often results in the addition of new media production as a last-minute addendum, "as a strategy for adding relevance or interest to a required course. Only rarely does that call address students as producers as well as consumers or critics".&lt;ref&gt;George, Diana. "From Analysis to Design: Visual Communication in the Teaching of Writing." CCC 54:1 September 2002, 11–39.&lt;/ref&gt;
Related to this, teachers are also frequently concerned that they do not have the ability or knowledge required to teach writing with new media and multi-modality to students because they are often unfamiliar with constantly evolving technologies.
 
A separate criticism is that new media use allows for more prevalent plagiarism.&lt;ref&gt;DeVoss, D. &amp; Rosati, A. (2008). "It wasn't me, was it?": Plagiarism and the web. In R. Morris, E. Overman-Smith, &amp; M. Sidler (Eds.), Computers in the Composition Classroom: A Critical Sourcebook (pp. 308–325). Boston, MA: Bedford / St. Martin's.&lt;/ref&gt; As more information is available on the Internet, it is much easier to simply "copy-paste" data into a new format. Furthermore, the questionable authorship of many digital texts complicates things both in terms of writing and citing works. Multi-media works are especially subject to concern over criticism as appropriation and remixing are rampant and even encouraged in composition classrooms and as debates over [[SOPA]] occur.
 
 
Many word processing programs have also been seen to reinforce norms and hierarchies. For instance, the commonly used spelling and grammar checkers of certain programs can be seen as possibly halting the natural progression of language and the creative use of it by encouraging writers to stay within the realm of standard vernaculars.&lt;ref&gt;Ericsson, P. &amp; McGee, T. (2008). The politics of the program: MS Word as the invisible grammarian. In R. Morris, E. Overman-Smith, &amp; M. Sidler (Eds.), Computers in the Composition Classroom: A Critical Sourcebook (pp. 308–325). Boston, MA: Bedford / St. Martin's.&lt;/ref&gt;  Furthermore, some cite the highly class-based symbolic nature of many digital word processing systems.&lt;ref&gt;Selfe, Cynthia L. and Selfe, Richard. "The Politics of the Interface: Power and Its Exercise in Electronic Contact Zones." Ed. Victor Villanueva &amp; Kristin L. Arola. Urbana: 2011. 739–764. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Hierarchies are also potentially reaffirmed with implications of the word "new" in "new media". While media theory aims to expand writers' view of modality, a society caught up in modernism is prone to believe that "newness" will result in social progress, as fostered in this case by technological advances, by equating "new" and "better".&lt;ref&gt;Liser, Martin; Dovey, Jon; Giddons, Seth; Grant, Iaian; &amp; Kelly, Kieran. New Media: A Critical Introduction, Second Ed. London: Routledge, 2008. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, class-based issues of access may serve to reinforce existing social structures; as those who are unable to access advanced technology fall behind in composition-based technological capabilities, they will be less able to compete in the job market and are likely to reaffirm the separation between classes. This is especially true in K–12 writing programs, as there are often economic differences between students and school districts. However, issues of access are disputed as technology becomes more available to the general public. Patricia Fitzsimmons-Hunter and Charles Moran, aware of these issues of access and their inevitable consequences, notably use technology that is friendlier to class-differences:
"We consider as our goal the integration of low-end, relatively affordable technology into the lives and work of those who are, or see themselves as being, left behind by the pace of the technological change: "roadkill," to use a popular contemporary metaphor, on the information superhighway."&lt;ref&gt;Fitzsimmons-Hunter, Patricia and Moran Charles. "Writing Teachers, Schools, Access, and Change." Literacy Theory in the Age of the Internet. Eds. Todd Taylor and Irene Ward. New York: Columbia, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
One of the most cited shortcomings of new media composition is that many teachers are unsure how to assess the writing. Oftentimes, teachers are only familiar with the standards that traditional text is held to. Texts written in new media encounter different rhetorical situations and contexts, and thus do not fit the standards that teachers are familiar with. Furthermore, these new texts often combine text with non-textual modes of communication, like the visual or auditory, making the situation for grading a "written work" even more complex.&lt;ref&gt;Sorapure, Madeleine. "Between Modes: Assessing Student New Media Compositions." Kairos. 10(2): 2006. PDF.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Spinoza.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Portrait of Benedictus de Spinoza|[[Benedictus de Spinoza|Spinoza]] lived from 1632 to 1677.]]

[[Baruch Spinoza|Spinoza's]] philosophy encompasses nearly every area of philosophical discourse, including [[metaphysics]], [[epistemology]], [[Political Philosophy|political philosophy]], [[ethics]], [[Philosophy of Mind|philosophy of mind]], and [[Philosophy of Science|philosophy of science]]. It earned Spinoza an enduring reputation as one of the most important and original thinkers of the seventeenth century.

Samuel Shirley, who translated Spinoza's complete works into English, summed up the significance of Spinoza's philosophy as follows:

{{quote|To my mind, although Spinoza lived and thought long before Darwin, Freud, Einstein, and the startling implications of quantum theory, he had a vision of truth beyond what is normally granted to human beings.&lt;ref name=shirley02&gt;{{cite book
|last = Shirley
|first = Samuel
|title = Complete Works
|publisher = Hackett
|year = 2002
}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Spinoza's philosophy is largely contained in two books: the ''[[Theologico-Political Treatise]]'', and the ''[[Ethics (Spinoza)|Ethics]]''. The former was published during his lifetime, but the latter, which contains the entirety of his philosophical system in its most rigorous form, was not published until after his death in 1677. The rest of the writings we have from Spinoza are either earlier, or incomplete, works expressing thoughts that were crystallized in the two aforementioned books (''e.g.'', the ''Short Treatise'' and the ''[[Tractatus de Intellectus Emendatione|Treatise on the Emendation of the Intellect]]''), or else they are not directly concerned with Spinoza's own philosophy (''e.g.'', ''The Principles of Cartesian Philosophy'' and ''The Hebrew Grammar''). He also left behind many letters that help to illuminate his ideas and provide some insight into what may have been motivating his views.&lt;ref name=shirley02 /&gt;&lt;ref name=sep1&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/spinoza/ Stanford.edu]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophy of religion==
Spinoza's philosophy of religion is largely contained in the ''[[Theologico-Political Treatise]]''. In that work he argues for the view that we should interpret scripture solely on its own terms by carefully studying it, not with any concepts or doctrines that cannot themselves be derived from the text. If we do this, he thought, it would turn out that many things we believe or are told by religious authorities about God and the universe could be shown to be false (''e.g.'', [[Miracles#Baruch Spinoza|miracles]]).&lt;ref name=shirley02 /&gt;
Spinoza's view is exemplified in the following sentence from the Preface to the ''Theological Political Treatise'':
{{quote|[It] is further evident from the fact that most of them assume as a basic principle for the understanding of Scripture and for extracting its true meaning that it is throughout truthful and divine--a conclusion which ought to be the end result of study and strict examination; and they lay down at the outset as a principle of interpretation that which would be far more properly derived from Scripture itself, which stands in no need of human fabrications.&lt;ref name=shirley02 /&gt;}}

===Ontological argument===
In Spinoza’s Ethics, he wrote a section titled “Treating of God and What Pertains to Him,” in which he discusses God’s existence and what God is. He starts off by saying: “whether there is a God, this, we say, can be proved”&lt;ref name=Spinoza123&gt;Spinoza, B. (2002). Complete Works (S. Shirley &amp; M. L. Morgan, Eds.). Indianapolis, IN: Hackett Publishing Company.&lt;/ref&gt;. His proof for God follows a similar structure as Descartes’ ontological argument. Descartes attempts to prove God’s existence by arguing that there “must be some one thing that is supremely good, through which all good things have their goodness”&lt;ref&gt;Nolan, L. (2001, June 18). Descartes' Ontological Argument.&lt;/ref&gt;. Spinoza’s argument differs in that he does not move straight from the conceivability of the greatest being to the existence of God, but rather uses a deductive argument from the idea of God. Spinoza says that man’s ideas do not come from himself, but from some sort of external cause. Thus the things whose characteristics a man knows must have come from some prior source. So, if man has the idea of God, then God must exist before this thought, because man cannot create an idea of his own imagination&lt;ref name=Spinoza123 /&gt;. 

===Substance of God===
	After stating his proof for God’s existence, Spinoza addresses who “God” is. Spinoza believed that God is “the sum of the natural and physical laws of the universe and certainly not an individual entity or creator”&lt;ref&gt;Cannon, J. A. (2009, May 17). World in time of upheaval: Sources of enlightenment. Deseret News.&lt;/ref&gt;.  Spinoza attempts to prove that God is just the substance of the universe by first stating that substances do not share attributes or essences, and then demonstrating that God is a “substance” with an infinite number of attributes, thus the attributes possessed by any other substances must also be possessed by God. Therefore, God is just the sum of all the substances of the universe&lt;ref name=Nadler123&gt;Nadler, S. (2001, June 29). Baruch Spinoza.&lt;/ref&gt;. God is the only substance in the universe, and everything is a part of God. “Whatever is, is in God, and nothing can be or be conceived without God”&lt;ref name=Spinoza123 /&gt;.

==Political philosophy==
[[Image:Spinoza Tractatus Theologico-Politicus.jpg|right|thumb|''Tractatus''
''Theologico-Politicus'' was published anonymously.]]
Spinoza's political philosophy is deeply influenced by both the turbulent time period in which he lived, and by the fact that he happened to live in a comparatively liberal place in Europe, which allowed him freedoms he wished to preserve and defend, as he says in the Preface to the Theological Political Treatise:
{{quote|Now since we have the rare good fortune to live in a commonwealth where freedom of judgment is fully granted to the individual citizen and he may worship God as he pleases, and where nothing is esteemed dearer and more precious than freedom, I think I am undertaking no ungrateful or unprofitable task in demonstrating that not only can this freedom be granted without endangering piety and the peace of the commonwealth, but also the peace of the commonwealth and piety depend on this freedom.&lt;ref name=shirley02 /&gt;}}

Spinoza's political philosophy is scattered in three books, the ''Theologico-political Treatise'', the ''Ethics'' and the ''Political Treatise''. A first look at its main principles could bring the uninformed reader to believe that it is the same as Hobbes's. Yet both theories differ in their conclusions. Spinoza's political philosophy is also a philosophy of the ''conatus'', the individual tendency to exist, which cannot be brought to extinction even in the most powerful Leviathan, even in the worst of authoritarian regimes. Every individual, in Spinoza's opinion, has a natural right. This right includes everything that he desires and he is able to obtain. As a result, my own natural right is the equivalent of my individual strength or power.&lt;ref&gt;Theologico-political Treatise, Chap. XVI. See also Political Treatise, Chap. II.&lt;/ref&gt; Hence, in Spinoza's political philosophy subjective rights (e.g. human rights) do not exist by nature, they are an institution of society, they only exist in the civil state. Moreover, according to Spinoza the notions of right and wrong have no meaning before society, since in the natural state there are no common norms, only individual desires (desires which can bring some people to dominate other weaker people).

How can civil society exist if people are only dominated by their own impulse to live? Through many ways. First, through the action of affections, the same ones that are described in the Ethics.&lt;ref&gt;See Ethics, Part III &amp; IV.&lt;/ref&gt; Those affections, my feelings, will bring me to cluster, to gather with people similar to myself: this similarity reinforces the feeling or representation of my own existence. In a similar fashion, human needs will also play a role: society, through distribution and specialisation of each task, can provide more goods than I can generate myself and with less effort. This is why the sciences and the arts can only develop in societies, where there is time to attend to things other than one's own survival.&lt;ref&gt;See the Theologico-Political Treatise, Chapter III&lt;/ref&gt; This fear, the need to constantly look after danger and threats and to live in constant tension, is the third cause or root phenomenon of society. Society brings me protection and security. We see hence that Spinoza, while incorporating in his work Hobbesian arguments (the argument of fear), develops a distinct analysis that will bring him to different conclusions: the need of a free society.

Here individuals never entirely renounce their individual right of nature. If in the Theologico-Political Treatise Spinoza refers to the notion of a pact that would be at the root of civil society, this notion disappears in the Political Treatise. People are not brought to form a society by their free will, but rather by their affections, or domination (a great number of individuals gathered through the authority of an unusually strong or charismatic man could also be a way to explain the birth of civil society). They are not passive subjects under the power of an absolute sovereign, but rather citizens that bring their own strength to the State. The power of the state exists in Spinoza's opinion only through the gathering of individual powers, powers which the society incorporates and can even develop if its political institutions are well designed.&lt;ref&gt;Alexandre Matheron, Individu et Communauté chez Spinoza&lt;/ref&gt; "Well designed" means that they must induce political leaders to act according to the rules, by their own will. In Spinoza's political philosophy, state is not opposed to the society but it is the apparatus that gives a certain form or existence to the society, to a gathering of human beings.&lt;ref&gt;Political Treatise, Chap. III.&lt;/ref&gt; It is not transcendent to it, as it is in Hobbes's philosophy.

These affirmations have some political implications. Here, individual rights exist only because we, as individuals, benefit from the power of our entire group. Members' rights are guaranteed by the strength of their political group (=State or imperium). Individual or subjective rights do not exist outside of a state, out of an organised society. But that doesn't mean that the government should have absolute power over us. To understand that well, we have to remember that according to Spinoza the government or society (there is no difference between them) are nothing else and do not exist without the individual conatuses of the individuals that are gathered in social entities. Individuals hold a part of their natural right in the civil state. They cannot restrain themselves from judging about the state of things as they wish, and any action that would go against this tendency can induce social unrest. It follows that the state must restrain itself from any action that could jeopardise its own integrity, as condemning determinate opinions can.&lt;ref&gt;Theologico-political Treatise, Chapter XX. Political Treatise, Chapters III &amp; V.&lt;/ref&gt; In a broader perspective, a state that relies on fearsome and inhuman ways to preserve its power cannot survive for long, since those ways impede the development of its own strength, and reinforce the tendency of the ''multitudo'', the masses, to unrest or to disobedience: obedience is necessary to preserve social order and peace.

Thus, we can distinguish Hobbes and Spinoza through the way they see the normal operation of the state. For Hobbes, the object of the state is to preserve peace through security and fear if needed. According to Spinoza, that kind of peace would not be a true peace but only the absence of unrest. True peace implies a state of things where individuals can accomplish and realise their potentialities, where there is a minimum peace of mind. This is why Spinoza favors states that are organised so that citizens can participate in the elaboration of laws, as a way to improve their quality, and in the operation of the state.

The vocabulary of Spinoza shows a modification of the way philosophers see politics compared to the Antiquity.&lt;ref&gt;Pierre-François Moreau, Spinoza. Etat et religion.&lt;/ref&gt; In Plato's and Aristotle's works good politics imply good government (defined as the way decisions are taken in a certain political community), in the sense that the different types of government can be ranked according to their virtues (aristocracy is better than democracy, which is better than oligarchy and tyranny according to Plato, and so on). Spinoza goes beyond this way of seeing things. There is not a better government in this sense: the better government is the government that the people of a certain country have been accustomed to, and there is no good in changing it: such a change alters the balance of power already in place and can bring unrest, conflict between opposed or entrenched interests. According to him, one should rather aim to design better institutions: for type of regime or government (Monarchy, Aristocracy, Democracy) Spinoza implements the outlines of what should be the good institutions for this regime. For example, in Monarchy there should be an official Council of the king, whose members are chosen formally, and whose opinions form a set of possible decisions for the king.&lt;ref&gt;Spinoza, Chapitre VII&lt;/ref&gt; This is a way of avoiding the issue of the king's secret counselors or ministers, who have a lot of influence on the king and often are the true decision takers. This system makes public and transparent through a formal process a matter of fact, the existence of a circle of advisers around the king.

==Philosophy of mind/psychology==

===The human mind===
Spinoza argues for a distinct conception of the human mind in Part Two of ''The Ethics''. He says the following:
{{quote|The first thing that constitutes the actual being of a human Mind is nothing but the idea of a singular thing which actually exists.(E2P11&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Citations of ''The Ethics'' in this article will be of this form. E2P11 refers to ''Ethics'', Part Two, Proposition 11. The letters 'P', 'D', and 'A' refer to proposition, definition, and axiom, respectively. The letters 'd', 's', or 'c', which may occur after the proposition number, refer to demonstrations, scholia, or corollaries, respectively. This is roughly the academic standard for citation of Spinoza's work. It has the practical advantage of being translation/edition neutral.&lt;/ref&gt;)&lt;ref name=curley85&gt;{{cite book
|last = Curley
|first = Edwin M.
|title = The Collected Works of Spinoza
|publisher = Princeton University Press
|year = 1985
}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
He then argues that it follows that "the human Mind is a part of the infinite intellect of God."(E2P11c)&lt;ref name=curley85 /&gt; Further, Spinoza says: "Whatever happens in the object of the idea constituting the human Mind must be perceived by the human Mind"(E2P12)&lt;ref name=curley85 /&gt; From this we get a clear rejection of Descartes' mind/body dualism: "The object of the idea constituting the human Mind is the Body, or a certain mode of Extension which actually exists, and nothing else."(E2P13)&lt;ref name=curley85 /&gt;

===The emotions===
One thing which seems, on the surface, to distinguish Spinoza's view of the emotions from both [[René Descartes|Descartes']] and [[David Hume|Hume's]] pictures of them is that he takes the emotions to be [[cognition|cognitive]] in some important respect. Jonathan Bennett claims that "Spinoza mainly saw emotions as caused by cognitions. [However] he did not say this clearly enough and sometimes lost sight of it entirely."&lt;ref name="Bennett84"&gt;{{cite book
|last = Bennett
|first = Jonathan
|title = A Study of Spinoza's Ethics
|publisher = Hackett
|year = 1984}}, pg. 276.&lt;/ref&gt;
Spinoza provides several demonstrations which purport to show truths about how human emotions work. The picture presented is, according to Bennett, "unflattering, coloured as it is by universal [[Egotism|egoism]]"&lt;ref name="Bennett84-2"&gt;{{cite book
|last = Bennett
|first = Jonathan
|title = A Study of Spinoza's Ethics
|publisher = Hackett
|year = 1984}}, pg. 277.
&lt;/ref&gt;
Spinoza's treatment of the emotions in Part Three of ''The Ethics'', "On the Origin and Nature of the Affects", utilizes a broad set of terminology, clearly intended to cover the whole of human experience. He tells us in the Preface:
{{quote|The Affects, therefore, of hate, anger, envy, etc., considered in themselves, follow from the same necessity and force of nature as any other singular things. And therefore they acknowledge certain causes, through which they are understood, and have certain properties, as worthy of our knowledge as the properties of any other thing, by the mere contemplation of which we are pleased.&lt;ref name="curley85" /&gt;}}

===Human freedom===
Whether there is any meaningful kind of freedom which humans may genuinely have is, in Spinoza's picture, at least contentious. He certainly claims that there is a kind of freedom, namely, that which is arrived at through adequate knowledge of God, or, what is the same: the universe. But in the last two propositions of Part Two of ''The Ethics'', P48 and P49, he explicitly rejects the traditional notion of [[free will]]. In E2P48, he claims:
{{quote|In the Mind there is no absolute, or free, will, but the Mind is determined to will this or that by a cause which is also determined by another, and this again by another, and so to infinity.&lt;ref name=curley85 /&gt;}}
So from this we get a strong sense of Spinoza's [[metaphysical naturalism]], that is, that the natural and human orders are contiguous. With that being the case, human freedom of a kind which would extricate us from the order of physical causes is impossible. However, Spinoza argues, we still ought to strive to understand the world around us, and in doing so, gain a greater degree of ''power'', which will allow us to be more active than passive, and there is a sense in which this is a kind of freedom.&lt;ref name=curley85 /&gt;

==Metaphysics==
{{Main article|Ethics (Spinoza)}}
Spinoza's [[metaphysics]] consists of one thing, substance, and its modifications (modes). Early in ''The Ethics'' Spinoza argues that there is only one substance, which is absolutely [[Infinity|infinite]], self-caused, and eternal. He calls this substance "[[God]]", or "[[Nature]]". In fact, he takes these two terms to be [[synonymous]] (in the [[Latin]] the phrase he uses is ''"Deus [[wikt:sive|sive]] Natura"''). For Spinoza the whole of the [[natural]] [[universe]] is made of one substance, God, or, what's the same, Nature, and its modifications (modes).
{{quote|It cannot be overemphasized how the rest of Spinoza's philosophy—his philosophy of mind, his epistemology, his psychology, his moral philosophy, his political philosophy, and his philosophy of religion—flows more or less directly from the metaphysical underpinnings in Part I of the ''Ethics''.&lt;ref&gt;Della Rocca, Michael. (2008). ''Spinoza''. Routledge., pg. 33.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Substance===
Spinoza defines "substance" as follows:
{{quote|By substance I understand what is in itself and is conceived through itself, ''i.e.'', that whose concept does not require the concept of another thing, from which it must be formed.(E1D3)&lt;ref name=curley85 /&gt;}}
This means, essentially, that substance is just whatever can be thought of without relating it to any other idea or thing. For example, if one thinks of a [[particular]] [[object (philosophy)|object]], one thinks of it as a kind of thing, ''e.g.'', ''x'' is a cat. Substance, on the other hand, is to be conceived of by itself, without understanding it as a particular kind of thing (because it isn't a particular thing at all).

===Attributes===
Spinoza defines "attribute" as follows:
{{quote|By attribute I understand what the intellect perceives of a substance, as constituting its essence.(E1D4)&lt;ref name=curley85 /&gt;}}
From this it can be seen that attributes are related to substance in some way. It is not clear, however, even from Spinoza's direct definition, whether, a) attributes are really the way(s) substance is, or b) attributes are simply ways to understand substance, but not necessarily the ways it really is.
Spinoza thinks that there are an ''infinite'' number of attributes, but there are two attributes for which Spinoza thinks we can have knowledge. Namely, ''thought'' and ''extension''.&lt;ref name=sep4&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/spinoza-attributes/ Stanford.edu]&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Thought ====
The attribute of thought is how substance can be understood to give rise to thoughts, or thinking things. When we understand a particular thing in the universe through the attribute of thought, we are understanding the mode as an ''idea'' of something (either another idea, or an object).

==== Extension ====
The attribute of extension is how substance can be understood to be physically extended in space. Particular things which have breadth and depth (that is, occupy space) are what is meant by ''extended''. It [[Logical consequence|follows from]] this that if substance and God are identical, on Spinoza's view, and contrary to the traditional conception, God has extension as one of His attributes.

===Modes===
Modes are particular modifications of substance, ''i.e.'', particular things in the world. Spinoza gives the following definition:
{{quote|By mode I understand the affections of a substance, ''or'' that which is in another through which it is also conceived.(E1D5)&lt;ref name=curley85 /&gt;}}

===Substance monism===
The argument for there only being one substance in the universe occurs in the first fourteen propositions of ''The Ethics''. The following proposition expresses Spinoza's commitment to substance monism:
{{quote|Except God, no substance can be or be conceived.(E1P14)&lt;ref name=curley85 /&gt;}}
Spinoza takes this proposition to follow directly from everything he says prior to it. Spinoza's [[monism]] is contrasted with Descartes' [[Dualism (philosophy of mind)|dualism]] and Leibniz's [[Pluralism (philosophy)|pluralism]]. It allows Spinoza to avoid the problem of interaction between mind and body, which troubled Descartes in his ''Meditations on First Philosophy''.

===Causality and modality===
The issue of [[causality]] and [[Modal logic|modality]] ([[Logical possibility|possibility]] and [[Metaphysical necessity|necessity]]) in Spinoza's philosophy is contentious.&lt;ref name=sep5&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/spinoza-modal/ Stanford.edu]&lt;/ref&gt; Spinoza's philosophy is, in one sense, thoroughly [[determinism|deterministic]] (or necessitarian). This can be seen directly from Axiom 3 of ''The Ethics'':
{{quote|From a given determinate cause the effect follows necessarily; and conversely, if there is no determinate cause, it is impossible for an effect to follow.(E1A3)&lt;ref name=curley85 /&gt;}}
Yet Spinoza seems to make room for a kind of freedom, especially in the fifth and final section of ''The Ethics'', ''"On the Power of the Intellect, or on Human Freedom"'':
{{quote|I pass, finally, to the remaining Part of the Ethics, which concerns the means or way, leading to Freedom. Here, then, I shall treat of the power of reason, showing what it can do against the affects, and what Freedom of Mind, or blessedness, is.(E5, Preface)&lt;ref name=curley85 /&gt;}}
So Spinoza certainly has a use for the word 'freedom', but he equates "Freedom of Mind" with "blessedness", a notion which is not traditionally associated with [[Free will|freedom of the will]] at all.

====The principle of sufficient reason (PSR)====
Though the [[Principle of sufficient reason|PSR]] is most commonly associated with [[Gottfried Leibniz]], it is arguably found in its strongest form in Spinoza's philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;Della Rocca, Michael. (2008). ''Spinoza'', Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;
Within the context of Spinoza's philosophical system, the PSR can be understood to unify causation and explanation.&lt;ref name="Della Rocca, Spinoza, 2008"&gt;Della Rocca, ''Spinoza'', 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; What this means is that for Spinoza, questions regarding the ''reason'' why a given phenomenon is the way it is (or exists) are always answerable, and are always answerable in terms of the relevant cause(s). This constitutes a rejection of [[teleology|teleological]], or [[final cause|final causation]], except possibly in a more restricted sense for human beings.&lt;ref name=curley85 /&gt;&lt;ref name="Della Rocca, Spinoza, 2008"/&gt; Given this, Spinoza's views regarding causality and modality begin to make much more sense.

===Parallelism&lt;!--linked from 'Psychophysical parallelism'--&gt;===
Spinoza's philosophy contains as a key proposition the notion that mental and physical (thought and extension) phenomena occur in parallel, but without causal interaction between them. He expresses this proposition as follows:
{{quote|The order and connection of ideas is the same as the order and connection of things.(E2P7)&lt;ref name=curley85 /&gt;}}
His proof of this proposition is that:
{{quote|The knowledge of an effect depends on, and involves, the knowledge of its cause.(E1A4)&lt;ref name=curley85 /&gt;}}
The reason Spinoza thinks the [[Psychophysical parallelism|parallelism]] follows from this axiom is that since the idea we have of each thing requires knowledge of its cause, this cause must be understood under the same attribute. Further, there is only one substance, so whenever we understand some chain of ideas of things, we understand that the way the ideas are causally related must be the same as the way the things themselves are related, since the ideas and the things are the same modes understood under different attributes.

==Epistemology==
Spinoza's epistemology is deeply [[Rationalism|rationalist]]. That is, unlike the [[Empiricism|empiricists]] who rejected knowledge of things as they are in themselves (in favour of knowledge merely of what appears to the senses), to think we can have [[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]] knowledge, knowledge of a world external from our sense perceptions, and, further, that this is tantamount to knowledge of God.&lt;ref name=curley85 /&gt; The majority of Spinoza's epistemological claims come in Part Two of ''The Ethics''.

===Truth and falsity===
Spinoza's notions of truth and falsity have to do with the relation between ideas and their objects. He thinks that:
{{quote|Every idea that in us is absolute, or adequate and perfect, is true. (E2P34)&lt;ref name=curley85 /&gt;}}
{{quote|Falsity consists in the privation of knowledge which inadequate, or mutilated and confused, ideas involve.(E2P35)&lt;ref name=curley85 /&gt;}}

====Adequate and inadequate ideas====
From this it is clear that the notions of adequate and inadequate ideas are important for understanding how Spinoza's view works. This may be explained in the following way. Spinoza argues that "All ideas, insofar as they are related to God, are true."(E2P32)&lt;ref name=curley85 /&gt; Since by "God", he means the one substance which exists necessarily and absolutely infinitely, it follows that an idea as it is with no reference to knowledge a particular person has, is [[logical truth|necessarily true]], since it just is a particular instance of God. (E2P32)&lt;ref name=curley85 /&gt;

On the other hand, Spinoza argues: "All ideas are in God; and, insofar as they are related to God, are true, and adequate. And so there are no inadequate or confused ideas except insofar as they are related to the singular Mind of someone."(E2P36d).&lt;ref name=curley85 /&gt; That is, even though ideas considered objectively as elements of the universe are always adequate (meaning their relation to their object is total), when a particular individual has an idea of something, such an idea is necessarily incomplete, and therefore, inadequate. This is the source of falsehood.

===Three kinds of knowledge===
Spinoza discusses the three kinds of knowledge in E2P40s2.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;All quotations in this section are from E2P40s2&lt;/ref&gt;

====The first kind of knowledge====
Spinoza thinks there are two ways we can have the first kind of knowledge:
# '''From random experience''': "from singular things which have been represented to us through the senses in a way that is mutilated, confused, and without order for the intellect; for that reasons I have been accustomed to call such perceptions knowledge from random experience."&lt;ref name=curley85 /&gt;
# '''From imagination''': "from signs, ''e.g.'', from the fact that, having heard or read certain words, we recollect things, and form certain ideas of them, which are like them, and through which we imagine the things."&lt;ref name=curley85 /&gt;
He calls these two ways "knowledge of the first kind, opinion or imagination."&lt;ref name=curley85 /&gt;

====The second kind of knowledge====
Spinoza argues that the second kind of knowledge arises:
{{quote|from the fact that we have common notions and adequate ideas of the properties of things."&lt;ref name=curley85 /&gt;}}
He goes on to explain what this means in the propositions which immediately follow.

====The third kind of knowledge====
This can be referred to as ''[[Intuition (knowledge)|Intuition]]'', but it means something rather technical for Spinoza. The third kind of knowledge is a particularly important part of Spinoza's philosophy because it is what he thinks allows us to have adequate knowledge, and therefore know things absolutely truly. As he says: {{quote|there is (as I shall show in what follows) another, third kind, which we shall call intuitive knowledge. And this kind of knowing proceeds from an adequate idea of certain attributes of God to the adequate knowledge of the essence of things.&lt;ref name=curley85 /&gt;}}

==Ethics==
[[Image:Spinoza Ethica.jpg|right|thumb|The opening page of Spinoza's ''magnum opus'', ''Ethics'']]
Spinoza's ethical views are deeply tied to his metaphysical system. This is evident from the following claim:
{{quote|As far as good and evil are concerned, they also indicate nothing positive in things, considered in themselves, nor are they anything other than modes of thinking, or notions we form because we compare things to one another.(E4, Preface)&lt;ref name=curley85 /&gt;}}
It is also apparent from this that he is a kind of [[subjectivist]] about [[moral values]]. That is, he does not take good and evil to be real properties/facts in the objects we attribute them to, but rather, they are simply thoughts we have about the comparative value of one thing to another for a particular person.

==="Good" and "Evil"===
Spinoza gives the following definitions of "Good", and "Evil":
{{quote|By good I shall understand what we certainly know to be useful to us.(E4D1)&lt;ref name=curley85 /&gt;}}
{{quote|By evil, however, I shall understand what we certainly know prevents us from being masters of some good.(E4D2)&lt;ref name=curley85 /&gt;}}
From this it is clear that Spinoza's view of moral value is in some sense instrumental. That is, the goodness or badness of a particular object or action is measured not by some essential  property.  The emphasis on "essential knowledge" is important, given Spinoza's view of what [[epistemology|epistemic]] certainty amounts to, i.e., adequate knowledge of God (a notion which is briefly elaborated on in this article).

===Blessedness===
Spinoza's notion of blessedness figures centrally in his ethical philosophy.
Blessedness (or salvation or freedom), Spinoza thinks,
{{quote|consists...in a constant and eternal love of God, or in God's love for men.(E5P36s)&lt;ref name=curley85 /&gt;}}
And this means, as Jonathan Bennett explains, that "Spinoza wants "blessedness" to stand for the most elevated and desirable state one could possibly be in."&lt;ref&gt;Bennett 1984, pg. 371&lt;/ref&gt; Here, understanding what is meant by 'most elevated and desirable state' requires understanding Spinoza's notion of ''[[conatus]]'' (read: ''striving'', but not necessarily with any [[teleology|teleological]] baggage) and that "perfection" refers not to (moral) value, but to completeness. Given that individuals are identified as mere modifications of the infinite Substance, it follows that no individual can ever be ''fully'' complete, i.e., perfect, or blessed. Absolute perfection, is, as noted above, reserved solely for Substance. Nevertheless, mere modes can attain a lesser form of blessedness, namely, that of pure understanding of oneself as one really is, i.e., as a definite modification of Substance in a certain set of relationships with everything else in the universe. That this is what Spinoza has in mind can be seen at the end of the ''Ethics'', in E5P24 and E5P25, wherein Spinoza makes two final key moves, unifying the metaphysical, epistemological, and ethical propositions he has developed over the course of the work. In E5P24, he links the understanding of particular things to the understanding of God, or Substance; in E5P25, the ''conatus'' of the mind is linked to the third kind of knowledge (''Intuition''). From here, it is a short step to the connection of Blessedness with the ''amor dei intellectualis'' ("intellectual love of God").

'''Physical information''' is a form of [[information]]. In [[physics]], it refers to the information of a [[physical system]]. Physical information is an important concept used in a number of fields of study in physics. For example, in [[quantum mechanics]], the form of physical information known as quantum information is used in many descriptions of quantum phenomena, such as [[observer (quantum physics)|quantum observation]], [[quantum entanglement]] and the [[causality|causal]] relationship between quantum objects that carry out either or both close and long-range interactions with one another.

In a somewhat general sense, the information of a given entity can be interpreted as its identity. As such, its information can be perceived to be the representation of the specification of its existence and thus, to be serving as the full description of each of the properties (real or potentialized) that are responsible for the entity’s existence. This description, of course, is one that, in a sense, is completely divorced from both any and all forms of language.

When clarifying the subject of information, care should be taken to distinguish between the following specific cases:{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}
* The phrase '''instance of information''' refers to the specific [[Instantiation principle|instantiation]] of information (identity, form, essence) that is associated with the being of ''a particular example'' of a thing. (This allows for the reference to separate instances of information that happen to share identical patterns.)
* A '''holder of information''' is a variable or mutable instance that can have different forms at different times (or in different situations).
* A '''piece of information''' is a particular fact about a thing's identity or properties, i.e., a portion of its instance.
* A '''pattern of information''' (or ''form'') is the pattern or content of an instance or piece of information. Many separate pieces of information may share the same form. We can say that those pieces are ''perfectly correlated'' or say that they are ''copies'' of each other, as in copies of a book.
* An '''embodiment of information''' is the thing whose essence is a given instance of information.
* A '''representation of information''' is an encoding of some pattern of information within some other pattern or instance.
* An '''interpretation of information''' is a decoding of a pattern of information as being a representation of another specific pattern or fact.
* A '''subject of information''' is the thing that is identified or described by a given instance or piece of information. (Most generally, a thing that is a subject of information could be either abstract or concrete; either mathematical or physical.)
* An '''amount of information''' is a quantification of ''how large'' a given instance, piece, or pattern of information is, or how much of a given system's information content (its instance) has a given attribute, such as being known or unknown. Amounts of information are most naturally characterized in [[logarithm]]ic units.

As the above usages are all conceptually distinct from each other, overloading the word "information" (by itself) to denote (or connote) several of these concepts simultaneously can lead to confusion. Accordingly, this article uses more detailed phrases, such as those shown in bold above, whenever the intended meaning is not made clear by the context.

==Classical versus quantum information==
The instance of information that is contained in a physical system is generally considered to specify
that system's "true" ''state''.  (A [[Scientific realism|realist]] would assert that a physical system ''always'' has a true state of some sort—whether classical or quantum—even though, in many practical situations, the system's true state may be largely unknown.)

When discussing the information that is contained in physical systems according to modern [[quantum physics]], we must distinguish between classical information and [[quantum information]].  Quantum information specifies the complete quantum state [[Vector (mathematics and physics)|vector]] (or equivalently, wavefunction) of a system, whereas classical information, roughly speaking, only picks out a definite (pure) quantum state if we are already given a prespecified set of distinguishable ([[orthogonal]]) quantum states to choose from; such a set forms a [[Basis (linear algebra)|basis]] for the [[vector space]] of all the possible pure quantum states (see [[pure state]]).  Quantum information could thus be expressed by providing (1) a choice of a basis such that the actual quantum state is equal to one of the basis vectors, together with (2) the classical information specifying which of these basis vectors is the actual one.  (However, the quantum information by itself does not include a specification of the basis, indeed, an uncountable number of different bases will include any given state vector.)

Note that the amount of classical information in a quantum system gives the maximum amount of information that can actually be measured and extracted from that quantum system for use by external classical (decoherent) systems, since only basis states are operationally distinguishable from each other.  The impossibility of differentiating between non-orthogonal states is a fundamental principle of quantum mechanics,{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} equivalent to [[Werner Heisenberg|Heisenberg]]'s [[uncertainty principle]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}  Because of its more general utility, the remainder of this article will deal primarily with classical information, although [[quantum information theory]] does also have some potential applications ([[quantum computing]], [[quantum cryptography]], [[quantum teleportation]]) that are currently being actively explored by both theorists and experimentalists.&lt;ref&gt;Michael A. Nielsen and Isaac L. Chuang, ''Quantum Computation and Quantum Information'', Cambridge University Press, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Quantifying classical physical information==
An amount of (classical) physical information may be quantified, as in [[information theory]], as follows.&lt;ref name="shannon"&gt;Claude E. Shannon and Warren Weaver, ''Mathematical Theory of Communication'', University of Illinois Press, 1963.&lt;/ref&gt;  For a system ''S'', defined abstractly in such a way that it has ''N'' distinguishable states (orthogonal quantum states) that are consistent with its description, the amount of information ''I''(''S'') contained in the system's state can be said to be log(''N'').  The logarithm is selected for this definition since it has the advantage that this measure of information content is additive when concatenating independent, unrelated subsystems; e.g., if subsystem ''A'' has ''N'' distinguishable states (''I''(''A'') = log(''N'') information content) and an independent subsystem ''B'' has ''M'' distinguishable states (''I''(''B'') = log(''M'') information content), then the concatenated system has ''NM'' distinguishable states and an information content ''I''(''AB'') = log(''NM'') = log(''N'') + log(''M'') = ''I''(''A'') + ''I''(''B'').  We expect information to be additive from our everyday associations with the meaning of the word, e.g., that two pages of a book can contain twice as much information as one page.

The base of the logarithm used in this definition is arbitrary, since it affects the result by only a multiplicative constant, which determines the unit of information that is implied.  If the log is taken base 2, the unit of information is the binary digit or bit (so named by [[John Tukey]]); if we use a natural logarithm instead, we might call the resulting unit the "[[nat (unit)|nat]]."  In magnitude, a nat is apparently identical to [[Boltzmann's constant]] ''k'' or the [[ideal gas constant]] ''R'', although these particular quantities are usually reserved to measure physical information that happens to be entropy, and that are expressed in physical units such as joules per [[kelvin]], or kilocalories per mole-kelvin.

==Physical information and entropy==
An easy way to understand the underlying unity between physical (as in thermodynamic) [[entropy]] and information-theoretic entropy is as follows: &lt;blockquote&gt;Entropy is simply that portion of the (classical) physical information contained in a system of interest (whether it is an entire physical system, or just a subsystem delineated by a set of possible messages) whose identity (as opposed to amount) is unknown (from the point of view of a particular knower).&lt;/blockquote&gt;This informal characterization corresponds to both von Neumann's formal definition of the entropy of a mixed quantum state (which is just a statistical mixture of pure states; see [[Quantum statistical mechanics#Von Neumann entropy|von Neumann entropy]]), as well as [[Claude Shannon]]'s definition of the entropy of a [[probability distribution]] over classical signal states or messages (see [[information entropy]]).&lt;ref name="shannon" /&gt;  Incidentally, the credit for Shannon's entropy formula (though not for its use in an [[information theory]] context) really belongs to [[Boltzmann]], who derived it much earlier for use in his [[H-theorem]] of statistical mechanics.&lt;ref&gt;[[Carlo Cercignani]], ''Ludwig Boltzmann: The Man Who Trusted Atoms'', Oxford University Press, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;  (Shannon himself references Boltzmann in his monograph.&lt;ref name="shannon" /&gt;)

Furthermore, even when the state of a system ''is'' known, we can say that the information in the system is still ''effectively'' entropy if that information is effectively incompressible, that is, if there are no known or feasibly determinable correlations or redundancies between different pieces of information within the system.  Note that this definition of entropy can even be viewed as equivalent to the previous one (unknown information) if we take a meta-perspective, and say that for observer ''A'' to "know" the state of system ''B'' means simply that there is a definite correlation between the state of observer ''A'' and the state of system ''B''; this correlation could thus be used by a meta-observer (that is, whoever is discussing the overall situation regarding A's state of knowledge about B) to compress his own description of the joint system ''AB''.&lt;ref name="mpf"&gt;Michael P. Frank, "Physical Limits of Computing", ''Computing in Science and Engineering'', '''4'''(3):16-25, May/June 2002. http://www.cise.ufl.edu/research/revcomp/physlim/plpaper.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to this connection with [[algorithmic information theory]],&lt;ref&gt;W. H. Zurek, "Algorithmic randomness, physical entropy, measurements, and the demon of choice," in (Hey 1999), pp. 393-410, and reprinted in (Leff &amp; Rex 2003), pp. 264-281.&lt;/ref&gt; entropy can be said to be that portion of a system's information capacity which is "used up," that is, unavailable for storing new information (even if the existing information content were to be compressed).  The rest of a system's information capacity (aside from its entropy) might be called ''extropy'', and it represents the part of the system's information capacity which is potentially still available for storing newly derived information.  The fact that physical entropy is basically "used-up storage capacity" is a direct concern in the engineering of computing systems; e.g., a computer must first remove the entropy from a given physical subsystem (eventually expelling it to the environment, and emitting heat) in order for that subsystem to be used to store some newly computed information.&lt;ref name="mpf" /&gt;

==Extreme physical information==
{{Main|Extreme physical information}}
In a theory developed by [[B. Roy Frieden]],&lt;ref&gt;[[B. Roy Frieden]] and R.A. Gatenby - ''Power laws of complex systems from extreme physical information'', ''Phys. Rev. E'' '''72,''' 036101, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[B. Roy Frieden]] and B.H. Soffer - ''Information-theoretic significance of the Wigner distribution'', ''Phys. Rev. A'', to be published 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[B. Roy Frieden]] and B.H. Soffer, "Lagrangians of physics and the game of Fisher-information transfer," Phys. Rev. E 52, 2274-2286, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[B. Roy Frieden]], ''Science from Fisher Information'', Cambridge University Press, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; "physical information" is defined as the loss of [[Fisher information]] that is incurred during the observation of a physical effect. Thus, if the effect has an intrinsic information level ''J'' but is observed at information level ''I'', the physical information is defined to be the difference ''I'' &amp;minus; ''J''. This defines an ''information [[Lagrangian mechanics|Lagrangian]]''. Frieden's ''principle of [[extreme physical information]]'' or EPI states that extremalizing ''I'' &amp;minus; ''J'' by varying the system probability amplitudes gives the correct amplitudes for most or even all physical theories. The EPI principle was recently proven.&lt;ref&gt;[[B. Roy Frieden]] and R.A. Gatenby - ''Principle of maximum Fisher information from Hardy's axioms applied to statistical systems'', ''Phys. Rev. E'' '''88,''' 042144, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;{{dubious|date=February 2015}} It follows from a system of mathematical axioms of L. Hardy defining all{{dubious|date=February 2015}} known physics.&lt;ref&gt;Hardy, L. - ''Probability theories in general and quantum theory in particular'', Studies in History and Philosophy of Modern Physics '''34,''' 381-393, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Computer art started in 1960s and by its nature is evolutionary since changes in technology and software directly affect what is possible. The term ''pixel art'' was first published by Adele Goldberg and Robert Flegal of Xerox Palo Alto Research Center in 1982.&lt;ref&gt;Adele Goldberg and Robert Flegal, "ACM president's letter: Pixel Art", ''Communications of the ACM'', Vol. 25, Issue 12, Dec. 1982.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Adobe Systems]], founded in 1982, developed the Postscript language and digital fonts, making drawing painting and image manipulation software popular.&lt;ref name="Art of the Digital Age"/&gt; [[Adobe Illustrator]], a vector drawing program based on the [[Bezier curve]], was introduced in 1987 and [[Adobe Photoshop]] followed in 1990.&lt;ref name="Art of the Digital Age"&gt;Wands, Bruce. (2006) Art of the Digital Age, Thames &amp; Hudson. {{ISBN|0-500-23817-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Adobe Flash]], a popular set of [[multimedia]] software used to add [[animation]] and [[interactivity]] to web pages, was introduced in 1996.

In the 2000s, pixel artists have been employed increasingly in video games and, to a lesser extent in music videos. These artists have remained somewhat underground until the mid-2000s.&lt;ref name="Art, One Click at a Time"&gt;{{cite web

[[File:ReconstructionsFromPixels.png|right|frame|A pixel does not need to be rendered as a small square.  This image shows alternative ways of reconstructing an image from a set of pixel values, using dots, lines, or smooth filtering.]]

The total number of pixels (''[[image resolution]]''), and the amount of information in each pixel (often called ''[[color depth]]'') determine the quality of an image.  For example, an image that stores 24 bits of color-information per pixel (the standard for computer displays since around 1995) can represent smoother degrees of shading than one that only stores 16 bits per pixel, but not as smooth as one that stores 48 bits.  Likewise, an image [[sample (graphics)|sample]]d at 640 x 480 pixels (and therefore containing 307,200 pixels) will look rough and blocky compared to one sampled at 1280 x 1024 (1,310,720 pixels). Because it takes a large amount of data to store a high-quality image, computer software often uses [[data compression]] techniques to reduce this size for images stored on disk. Some techniques sacrifice information, and therefore image quality, in order to achieve a smaller file-size. Computer scientists refer to [[image compression|compression techniques]] that lose information as [[lossy compression]].

Modern computer-monitors typically display about 72 to 130 [[pixels per inch]] (PPI), and some modern consumer printers can resolve 2400 [[dots per inch]] (DPI) or more; determining the most appropriate image resolution for a given printer-resolution can pose difficulties, since printed output may have a greater level of detail than a viewer can discern on a monitor.  Typically, a resolution of 150 to 300 pixel per inch works well for 4-color process ([[CMYK]]) printing.
Drawings usually start with what is called the [[line art]], which is the basic line that defines the item the artist intends to create. Line arts can be either traced over [[image scanner|scanned]] drawings or hand drawn on the computer itself by the use of a [[Computer mouse|mouse]] or a [[graphics tablet]] and are often shared among other pixel artists in diverse websites in order to receive some feedback. Other techniques, some resembling [[painting]], also exist, such as knowledge of the [[color theory]]. The limited palette often implemented into [[pixel art]] usually promotes the use of [[dithering]] in order to achieve different shades and colors (when necessary); hand-made [[Spatial anti-aliasing|anti-aliasing]] is also used for smoother purposes. A pixel artist will exponentially increase the zoom of whatever they are working on to make adjustments as needed and then view the results until desired changes are achieved.&lt;ref name="Flash Enabled: Fl"/&gt;

'''Predictive coding''' models suggest that the [[brain]] is constantly generating and updating hypotheses that predict sensory input at varying levels of abstraction. This framework is in contrast to the view that the brain integrates exteroceptive information through a predominantly feedforward process, with feedback connections playing a more minor role in cortical processing.

==Origins==

Theoretical ancestors to predictive coding date back as early as 1860 with Helmholz’s concept of [[unconscious inference]] (Clark, 2013). Unconscious inference refers to the idea that the human brain fills in visual information to make sense of a scene. For example, if something is relatively smaller than another object in the visual field, the brain uses that information as a likely cue of depth, such that the perceiver ultimately (and involuntarily) experiences depth. The understanding of perception as the interaction between sensory stimuli (bottom-up) and conceptual knowledge (top-down) continued to be established by [[Jerome Bruner (psychologist)]] who, starting in the 1940s, studied the ways in which needs, motivations and expectations influence perception, research that came to be known as 'New Look' psychology. In 1981, [[James McClelland (psychologist)|McClelland]] and [[David Rumelhart|Rumelhart]] in their seminal paper examined the interaction between processing features (lines and contours) which form letters, which in turn form words. While the features suggest the presence of a word, they found that when letters were situated in the context of a word, people were able to identify them faster than when they were situated in a non-word without semantic context. McClelland and Rumelhart’s parallel processing model describes perception as the meeting of top-down (conceptual) and bottom-up (sensory) elements.

In the late 1990s, the idea of top-down and bottom-up processing was translated into a computational model of vision by [[Rajesh Rao|Rao]] and [[Dana H. Ballard|Ballard]] (1999). Their paper demonstrated that there could be a generative model of a scene (top-down processing), which would receive feedback via error signals (how much the visual input varied from the prediction), which would subsequently lead to updating the prediction. The computational model was able to replicate well-established receptive field effects, as well as less understood extra-classical receptive field effects such as end-stopping. Today, the fields of computer science and cognitive science incorporate these same concepts to create the multilayer generative models that underlie machine learning and neural nets ([[Geoff Hinton|Hinton]], 2010).

== General framework ==

Most of the research literature in the field has been about [[sensory perception]], particularly vision, which is more easily conceptualized. However, the predictive coding framework could also be applied to different neural systems. Taking the sensory system as an example, the brain solves the seemingly intractable problem of modelling distal causes of sensory input through a version of [[Bayesian inference]]. It does this by modelling predictions of lower-level sensory inputs via backward connections from relatively higher levels in a cortical hierarchy (Clark, 2013). 
Constrained by the statistical regularities of the outside world (and certain evolutionarily prepared predictions), the brain encodes top-down generative models at various temporal and spatial scales in order to predict and effectively suppress sensory inputs rising up from lower levels. A comparison between predictions (priors) and sensory input (likelihood) yields a difference measure (e.g. prediction error, free energy, or surprise) which, if it is sufficiently large beyond the levels of expected statistical noise, will cause the generative model to update so that it better predicts sensory input in the future.

If, instead, the model accurately predicts driving sensory signals, activity at higher levels cancels out activity at lower levels, and the posterior probability of the model is increased. Thus, predictive coding inverts the conventional view of perception as a mostly bottom-up process, suggesting that it is largely constrained by prior predictions, where signals from the external world only shape perception to the extent that they are propagated up the cortical hierarchy in the form of prediction error.

===Precision weighting===
 
Expectations about the precision (or inverse variance) of incoming sensory input are crucial for effectively minimizing prediction error in that the expected precision of a given prediction error can inform confidence in that error, which influences the extent to which the error is weighted in updating predictions (Feldman &amp; Friston, 2010). Given that the world we live in is loaded with [[statistical noise]], precision expectations must be represented as part of the brain’s generative models, and they should be able to flexibly adapt to changing contexts. For instance, the expected precision of visual prediction errors likely varies between dawn and dusk, such that greater conditional confidence is assigned to errors in broad daylight than errors in prediction at nightfall (Hohwy, 2012). It has recently been proposed that such weighting of prediction errors in proportion to their estimated precision is, in essence, attention (Friston, 2009), and that the process of devoting attention may be neurobiologically accomplished by ascending reticular activating systems (ARAS) optimizing the “gain” of prediction error units.

===Active inference===

The same principle of prediction error minimization has been used to provide an account of behavior in which motor actions are not commands but descending proprioceptive predictions. In this scheme of [[active inference]], classical reflex arcs are coordinated so as to selectively sample sensory input in ways that better fulfill predictions, thereby minimizing proprioceptive prediction errors (Friston, 2009). Indeed, Adams et al. (2013) review evidence suggesting that this view of hierarchical predictive coding in the motor system provides a principled and neurally plausible framework for explaining the agranular organization of the motor cortex. This view suggests that “perceptual and motor systems should not be regarded as separate but instead as a single active inference machine that tries to predict its sensory input in all domains:  visual, auditory, somatosensory, interoceptive and, in the case of the motor system, proprioceptive” (Adams, Shipp, &amp; Friston, 2013).

==Neural theory in predictive coding==

Evaluating the empirical evidence that suggests a neurologically plausible basis for predictive coding is a broad and varied task. For one thing, and according to the model, predictive coding occurs at every iterative step in the perceptual and cognitive processes; accordingly, manifestations of predictive coding in the brain include genetics, specific cytoarchitecture of cells, systemic networks of neurons, and whole brain analyses. Due to this range of specificity, different methods of investigating the neural mechanisms of predictive coding have been applied, where available; more generally, however, and at least as it relates to humans, there are significant methodological limitations to investigating the potential evidence and much of the work is based on computational modeling of microcircuits in the brain. Notwithstanding, there has been substantial (theoretical) work that has been applied to understanding predictive coding mechanisms in the brain. This section will focus on specific evidence as it relates to the predictive coding phenomenon, rather than analogues, such as homeostasis (which are, nonetheless, integral to our overall understanding of Bayesian inference but already supported heavily; see Clark, 2012 for a review).

Much of the early work that applied a predictive coding framework to neural mechanisms came from sensory neurons, particularly in the visual cortex (e.g., Rao and Ballard, 1999; Bolz &amp; Gilbert, 1986).

More generally, however, what seems to be required by the theory are (at least) two types of neurons (at every level of the perceptual hierarchy): one set of neurons that encode incoming sensory input, so called feed-forward projections; one set of neurons that send down predictions, so called feed-backward projections. It is important to note that these neurons must also carry properties of error detection; which class of neurons has these properties is still up for debate (see Koster-Hale &amp; Saxe, 2013; Seth, 2013). These sort of neurons have found support in superficial and non-superficial pyramidal neurons.

At a more whole-brain level, there is evidence that different cortical layers (aka laminae) may facilitate the integration of feedforward and feed-backward projections across hierarchies. These cortical layers, divided into granular, agranular, and dysgranular, which house the subpopulations of neurons mentioned above, are divided into 6 main layers. The cytoarchitecture within these layers are the same, but they differ across layers. For example, layer 4 of the granular cortex contain granule cells which are excitatory and distribute thalamocortical inputs to the rest of the cortex. According to one model: &lt;blockquote&gt;

“...prediction neurons... in deep layers of agranular cortex drive active inference by sending sensory predictions via projections ...to supragranular layers of dysgranular and granular sensory cortices. Prediction-error neurons ….in the supragranular layers of granular cortex compute the difference between the predicted and received sensory signal, and send prediction-error signals via projections...back to the deep layers of agranular cortical regions. Precision cells … tune the gain on predictions and prediction error dynamically, thereby giving these signals reduced (or, in some cases, greater) weight depending on the relative confidence in the descending predictions or the reliability of incoming sensory signals.” (Barrett &amp; Simmons, 2015)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In sum, the neural evidence is still in its infancy.

==Applying predictive coding==

===Perception===

The empirical evidence for predictive coding is most robust for perceptual processing. As early as 1999, Rao and Ballard proposed a hierarchical [[visual processing]] model in which higher-order visual cortical area sends down predictions and the feedforward connections carry the residual errors between the predictions and the actual lower-level activities (Rao and Ballard, 1999). According to this model, each level in the hierarchical model network (except the lowest level, which represents the image) attempts to predict the responses at the next lower level via feedback connections, and the error signal is used to correct the estimate of the input signal at each level concurrently (Rao and Ballard, 1999). Emberson et al. established the top-down modulation in infants using a cross-modal audiovisual omission paradigm, determining that even infant brains have expectation about future sensory input that is carried downstream from visual cortices and are capable of expectation-based feedback (Emberson et al., 2015). Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) data showed that infant [[occipital cortex]] responded to unexpected visual omission (with no visual information input) but not to expected visual omission. These results establish that in a hierarchically organized perception system, higher-order neurons send down predictions to lower-order neurons, which in turn sends back up the prediction error signal.

===Interoception===

There have been several competing models for the role of predictive coding in [[interoception]].

In 2013, Anil Seth proposed that our subjective feeling states, otherwise known as emotions, are generated by predictive models that is built actively of causal interoceptive appraisals.
In relation to how we attribute internal states of others to causes, Sasha Ondobaka, James Kilner, and Karl Friston (2015) proposed that the free energy principle requires the brain to produce a continuous series of predictions with the goal of reducing the amount of prediction error that manifests as “free energy”. These errors are then used to model anticipatory information about what the state of the outside world will be and attributions of causes of that world state, including understanding of causes of others’ behavior. This is especially necessary because, to create these attributions, our multimodal sensory systems need interoceptive predictions to organize themselves. Therefore, Ondobaka posits that predictive coding is key to understanding other people’s internal states.

In 2015, Lisa Barrett and W. Kyle Simmons (2015) proposed the Embodied Predictive Interoception Coding model, a framework that unifies Bayesian active inference principles with a physiological framework of corticocortical connections. Using this model, they posited that agranular visceromotor cortices are responsible for generating predictions about interoception, thus, defining the experience of interoception.

In 2017, contrary to the inductive notion that emotion categories  are biologically distinct, Barrett (2017) proposed the theory of constructed emotion, which is the account that a biological emotion category is constructed based on a conceptual category--the accumulation of instances sharing a goal. In a predictive coding model, Barrett hypothesizes that, in interoception, our brains regulate our bodies by activating "embodied simulations" (full-bodied representations of sensory experience) to anticipate what our brains predict that the external world will throw at us sensorially and how we will respond to it with action. These simulations are either preserved if, based on our brain's predictions, they prepare us well for what actually subsequently occurs in the external world, or they, and our predictions, are adjusted to compensate for the their error in comparison to what actually occurs in the external world and how well-prepared we were for it. Then, in a trial-error-adjust process, our bodies find similarities in goals among certain successful anticipatory simulations and group them together under conceptual categories. Every time a new experience arises, our brains use this past trial-error-adjust history to match the new experience to one of the categories of accumulated corrected simulations that is shares the most similarity with. Then, they apply the corrected simulation of that category to the new experience in the hopes of preparing our bodies for the rest of the experience. If it does not, the prediction, the simulation, and perhaps the boundaries of the conceptual category are revised in the hopes of higher accuracy next time, and the process continues. Barrett hypothesizes that, when prediction error for a certain category of simulations for x-like experiences is minimized, what results is a correction-informed simulation that the body will reenact for every x-like experience, resulting in a correction-informed full-bodied representation of sensory experience--an emotion. In this sense, Barrett proposes that we construct our emotions because the conceptual category framework our brains use to compare new experiences, and to pick the appropriate predictive sensory simulation to activate, is built on the go.

===Challenges===

As a mechanistic theory, predictive coding has not been mapped out physiologically on the neuronal level. One of the biggest challenges to the theory has been the imprecision of exactly how prediction error minimization works (Kogo &amp; Trengove, 2015). In some studies, the increase in BOLD signal has been interpreted as error signal while in others it indicates changes in the input representation (Kogo &amp; Trengove, 2015). A crucial question that needs to be addressed is what exactly constitutes error signal and how it is computed at each level of information processing (Bastos et al., 2012). Another challenge that has been posed is predictive coding’s computational tractability. According to Kwisthout and Rooij, the subcomputation in each level of the predictive coding framework potentially hides a computationally intractable problem, which amounts to “intractable hurdles” that computational modelers have yet to overcome (Kwisthout &amp; Rooij, 2013). Ransom and Fazelpour (2015) indicate "Three Problems for the Predictive Coding Theory of Attention".

Future research could focus on clarifying the neurophysiological mechanism and computational model of predictive coding.

{{Multiple issues|{{globalize|date=November 2018}}{{one source|date=November 2018}}}}

A '''property qualification''' is a clause or rule by which those without property (land), or those without property of a set appraised value, or those without income of a set value, are not enfranchised to vote in elections, to stand for election, to hold office or from other activities. 

== History ==
The [[Eighteenth Century]] [[Militia (Great Britain)|Militia of England and Wales]] did not sell [[Officer (armed forces)|commissions]] in the way that the [[British Army]] did at the time, but instead restricted them property owners and those with income of a set minimum value. 

In jurisdictions where the political and economic spheres are dominated by one ethnic, religious or racial group, property qualifications have been used as a way to exclude members of other ethnic, religious or racial groups that may disproportionately lack the required resources. This was the case in [[Northern Ireland]], where a property requirement was used to exclude indigenous Irish Catholics from voting in elections for seats in the [[Stormont Parliament]] until 1969.&lt;ref&gt;''A History of the Ulster Unionist Party: Protest, Pragmatism and Pessimism'', by Graham Walker. Page 162. Manchester Studies in Modern History. {{ISBN|978-0-7190-6109-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to the 1921 [[Partition of Ireland]], the [[Protestant Ascendancy]] had similarly barred most of the native Irish Catholics from voting for Irish seats in the Parliament of the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]] once the last bar to Catholics voting in the United Kingdom had been lifted by the [[Roman Catholic Relief Act 1829]]. The property qualification remained in place for United Kingdom elections until the passage of the [[Representation of the People Act 1918]].

[[File:Probability-Probability plot, quality characteristic data.png|300px|right|thumb]]In statistics, a '''P–P plot''' ('''probability–probability plot''' or '''percent–percent plot''' or '''P value plot''') is a [[probability plot]] for assessing how closely two [[data set]]s agree, which plots the two [[cumulative distribution function]]s against each other. P-P plots are vastly used to evaluate the [[skewness]] of a distribution.

The [[Q–Q plot]] is more widely used, but they are both referred to as "the" probability plot, and are potentially confused.

== Definition ==
A P–P plot plots two [[cumulative distribution function]]s (cdfs) against each other:&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=kJbVO2G6VicC Nonparametric statistical inference] by [[Jean D. Gibbons|Jean Dickinson Gibbons]], Subhabrata Chakraborti, 4th Edition, CRC Press, 2003, {{ISBN|978-0-8247-4052-8}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=kJbVO2G6VicC&amp;pg=PA144#PPA145,M1 p. 145]&lt;/ref&gt;
given two probability distributions, with cdfs "''F''" and "''G''", it plots &lt;math&gt;(F(z),G(z))&lt;/math&gt; as ''z'' ranges from &lt;math&gt;-\infty&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;\infty.&lt;/math&gt; As a cdf has range [0,1], the domain of this parametric graph is &lt;math&gt;(-\infty,\infty)&lt;/math&gt; and the range is the unit square &lt;math&gt;[0,1]\times [0,1].&lt;/math&gt;

Thus for input ''z'' the output is the pair of numbers giving what ''percentage'' of ''f'' and what ''percentage'' of ''g'' fall at or below ''z.''

The comparison line is the 45° line from (0,0) to (1,1) – the distributions are equal if and only if the plot falls on this line – any deviation indicates a difference between the distributions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Derrick|first1=B|last2=Toher|first2=D|last3=White|first3=P|title=Why Welchs test is Type I error robust|journal=The Quantitative Methods for Psychology|date=2016|volume=12|issue=1|pages=30-38|doi=10.20982/tqmp.12.1.p030}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Example ==
As an example, if the two distributions do not overlap, say ''F'' is below ''G,'' then the P–P plot will move from left to right along the bottom of the square – as ''z'' moves through the support of ''F,'' the cdf of ''F'' goes from 0 to 1, while the cdf of ''G'' stays at 0 – and then moves up the right side of the square – the cdf of ''F'' is now 1, as all points of ''F'' lie below all points of ''G,'' and now the cdf of ''G'' moves from 0 to 1 as ''z'' moves through the support of ''G.'' (need a graph for this paragragh)

== Use ==
As the above example illustrates, if two distributions are separated in space, the P–P plot will give very little data – it is only useful for comparing probability distributions that have nearby or equal location. Notably, it will pass through the point (1/2,&amp;nbsp;1/2) if and only if the two distributions have the same [[median]].

P–P plots are sometimes limited to comparisons between two samples, rather than comparison of a sample to a theoretical model distribution.&lt;ref name="thode223"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=gbegXB4SdosC Testing for Normality], by Henry C. Thode, CRC Press, 2002, {{ISBN|978-0-8247-9613-6}}, 
Section 2.2.3, Percent–percent plots, [https://books.google.com/books?id=gbegXB4SdosC&amp;pg=PA31#PPA23,M1 p. 23]&lt;/ref&gt; However, they are of general use, particularly where observations are not all modelled with the same distribution.

However, it has found some use in comparing a sample distribution from a ''known'' theoretical distribution: given ''n'' samples, plotting the continuous theoretical cdf against the empirical cdf would yield a stairstep (a step as ''z'' hits a sample), and would hit the top of the square when the last data point was hit. Instead one only plots points, plotting the observed ''k''th observed points (in order: formally the observed ''k''th order statistic) against the ''k''/(''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1) [[quantile]] of the theoretical distribution.&lt;ref name="thode223" /&gt; This choice of "plotting position" (choice of quantile of the theoretical distribution) has occasioned less controversy than the choice for Q–Q plots. The resulting goodness of fit of the 45° line gives a measure of the difference between a sample set and the theoretical distribution.

A P–P plot can be used as a graphical adjunct to a tests of the fit of probability distributions,&lt;ref name=Michael&gt;Michael J.R. (1983) "The stabilized probability plot". [[Biometrika]], 70(1), 11&amp;ndash;17. {{JSTOR|2335939}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Shorack&gt;Shorack, G.R., Wellner, J.A (1986) ''Empirical Processes with Applications to Statistics'', Wiley. {{ISBN|0-471-86725-X}} p248&amp;ndash;250&lt;/ref&gt; with additional lines being included on the plot to indicate either specific acceptance regions or the range of expected departure from the 1:1 line. An improved version of the P–P plot, called the SP or S–P plot, is available,&lt;ref name="Michael"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Shorack"/&gt; which makes use of a [[variance-stabilizing transformation]] to create a plot on which the variations about the 1:1 line should be the same at all locations.

[[File:Traffic jam Rio de Janeiro 03 2008 28.JPG|thumb|right|[[Traffic congestion]] may be a contributing factor to driver frustration and road rage.|300px]]
'''Road rage''' is aggressive or angry behavior exhibited by a driver of a road vehicle, which includes rude and offensive gestures, verbal insults, physical threats or dangerous driving methods targeted toward another driver or a [[pedestrian]] in an effort to intimidate or release frustration. Road rage can lead to altercations, assaults and collisions that result in serious physical injuries or even death. It can be referred to as an extreme case of [[aggressive driving]].&lt;ref name="Sourced from AAA Foundation" /&gt;

The term originated in the United States in 1987–1988 from anchors at [[KTLA]], a television station in [[Los Angeles, California]], when a rash of freeway shootings occurred on the Interstate 405, 110, and 10 freeways in Los Angeles. These shooting sprees even spawned a response from the [[American Automobile Association|AAA Motor Club]] to its members on how to respond to drivers with road rage or aggressive maneuvers and gestures.

According to a study by the [[AAA Foundation for Traffic Safety]] that examined police records nationally, there are more than 1,200 incidents of road rage on average reported per year in the United States, a number of which have ended with serious injuries or even fatalities. These rates rose yearly throughout the six years of the study.&lt;ref name="Sourced from AAA Foundation "&gt;{{cite web |url=http://arizona.drivinguniversity.com/driving-safety/road-rage |title=Road Rage |publisher=Arizona Driving University |accessdate=August 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of studies have found that individuals with road rage were predominantly young (33 years old on average) and 96.6% male.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sansone |first1=Randy A. |last2=Sansone |first2=Lori A. |journal=Psychiatry |date=July 2010 |volume=7 |issue=7 |pages=14–18 |pmc=2922361 |title=Road Rage: What's Driving It? |pmid=20805914}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Germany, a gun-wielding truck driver was accused of firing at more than 762 vehicles and arrested in 2013, an exceptional case of road rage. According to authorities, the autobahn sniper was motivated by "annoyance and frustration with traffic."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/25/autobahn-sniper-road-rage-shootings-germany|title=Autobahn sniper admits more than 700 road rage shootings in Germany|last=Connolly|first=Kate|date=2013-06-25|newspaper=The Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal status==
[[File:Korek Brama Portowa.jpg|thumb|right|A traffic jam in Poland|293x293px]]
In some jurisdictions, there can be a legal difference between "road rage" and "[[aggressive driving]]." In the U.S., only a few states have enacted special aggressive driving laws, where road rage cases are normally prosecuted as [[assault]] and [[Battery (crime)|battery]] (with or without a vehicle), or "[[vehicular homicide]]."{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}} 

The legal definition of road rage encompasses a group of behaviors expressed while driving, or stemming from traffic-related incidents. The U.S. [[National Highway Traffic Safety Administration]] defines road rage as when "The operation of a motor vehicle in a manner that endangers or is likely to endanger persons or property." This definition makes the distinction that aggressive driving is a traffic violation and road rage is a criminal offense.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://one.nhtsa.gov/people/injury/research/aggdrivingenf/pages/introduction.html#fn1|title=DOT HS 809 707|website=one.nhtsa.gov|access-date=2018-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Effects on drivers==
[[File:Learner driver practising reversing in Quatremaine Road - geograph.org.uk - 858435.jpg|thumb|right|A [[driver's education|learner driver]] practising reversing. [[The Automobile Association|The AA]] has reported that learner drivers and [[driving instructor]]s are becoming targets of road rage at an increasing rate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Learner drivers targeted by road rage 'idiots'|url=www.theaa.com/motoring_advice/news/driving-school-road-rage-idiots.html|website=[[The Automobile Association|The AA]]|accessdate=2 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
A stressed driver’s behavior depends on that driver’s coping abilities. Generally, drivers who scored high on aggression tests used direct confrontation strategies when faced with stress while driving. Strategies include long horn honks, swerving, tailgating and attempting to fight the other driver. Many drivers who experience road rage have admitted that they believe they commit more traffic violations.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.safemotorist.com/articles/road_rage.aspx|title=What Causes Road Rage {{!}} Road Rage Defined {{!}} How to Deal with Road Rage|website=www.safemotorist.com|access-date=2016-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Driving presents many stresses any time a person is behind the wheel because of high speeds and other drivers making different decisions. As stress increases, the likelihood of a person having road rage increases dramatically, and if a person has road rage, their stress levels increase. Typically, younger males are most susceptible to road rage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.webmd.com/mental-health/features/road-rage-what-it-is-how-to-avoid-it|title=Road Rage: What It Is, How to Avoid It|website=WebMD|language=en-US|access-date=2016-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to one study, people who customize their cars with stickers and other adornments are more prone to road rage. The number of territory markers predicted road rage better than vehicle value or condition. Furthermore, only the number of bumper stickers, and not their content, predicted road rage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.nature.com/news/2008/080613/full/news.2008.889.html|title=Bumper stickers reveal link to road rage|last=Kaplan|first=Matt|date=13 June 2008|journal=Nature|access-date=August 28, 2016|doi=10.1038/news.2008.889}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Territorial Markings as a Predictor of Driver Aggression and Road Rage|last=Szlemko|first=William J. et al.|date=21 May 2008|journal=Journal of Applied Social Psychology|doi=10.1111/j.1559-1816.2008.00364.x|volume=38|issue = 6|pages=1664–1688}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==As a medical condition==
Road rage is not an official mental disorder recognized in the ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]]'' (''DSM''), although according to an article published by the [[Associated Press]] in June 2006, the behaviors typically associated with road rage can be the result of a disorder known as [[intermittent explosive disorder]] that is recognized in the DSM. This conclusion was drawn from surveys of some 9,200 adults in the United States between 2001 and 2003 and was funded by the [[National Institute of Mental Health]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/13152708/ns/health-mental_health/t/road-rage-gets-medical-diagnosis/ | title='Road rage' gets a medical diagnosis | publisher=MSNBC | date=2006-06-05 | accessdate=August 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Penalties==
Road rage is a relatively serious act: It may be seen as an endangerment of [[public safety]]. It is, however, not always possible to judge intent by external observation, so "road ragers" who are stopped by [[police]] may be charged with other offences such as careless or [[reckless driving]], or may be fined. Road ragers may be considered as criminals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2010-03-31/man-charged-over-road-rage-incident/387760 | title=Man charged over road rage incident | publisher=ABC News | date=March 31, 2010 | accessdate=August 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.yorkdispatch.com/news/ci_18652272 | title=McSherrystown man charged in road-rage incident | publisher=York Dispatch | date=2011-08-10 | accessdate=August 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Australia ===
In [[New South Wales]], [[Australia]], road rage is considered an extremely serious act. Any person who chases another motorist or shows intimidating and/or bullying towards another road user can be charged with ''predatory driving'', a serious offence that can leave the culprit in jail for up to 5 years. Offenders can also be fined A$100,000 and disqualified from driving, whether or not he or she intended to harm the victim physically. If the predatory driving results in a physical assault or harm, and/or the victim's car was intentionally damaged, penalties can be much more severe.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}

Additionally, most common-law countries prohibit common assault, which could apply to road rage where the personal safety of the victim is seen to be threatened. The common law regards assault as both a criminal and civil matter, leading to both public criminal penalties and private civil liabilities.

=== Germany ===
Road rage, insults and rude gestures in traffic can lead to fines and even prison sentences to drivers who shout insults or make offensive gestures while driving.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eur.army.mil/news/2009/2009-11-24-1_RoadRage.pdf Road rage, insults, rude gestures can lead to fines, prison in Germany], Robert Szostek U.S. Army Europe Office of the Provost Marshal Public Affairs Office, November 24, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

=== New Zealand ===
In [[New Zealand]], Road Rage in itself is not an offence,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.stuff.co.nz/motoring/news/95181866/driving-us-crazy-why-we-need-to-take-road-rage-more-seriously | title=Road rage: Why human behaviour changes behind the wheel | publisher=Stuff | date=July 29, 2017 | author=Sewell, Rochelle | accessdate=March 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; but Drivers are usually charged with other offences committed during an act of road rage (usually [[assault]] or unlawful possession of an offensive weapon). Drivers have a legal duty to take reasonable care to avoid endangerment of human life when operating a vehicle (s 156 Crimes Act 1961); failure to discharge this duty, such as an act of aggressive driving, can give rise to liability in criminal nuisance (s 146 Crimes Act 1961). Ramming a vehicle constitutes intentional or reckless damage to property, a criminal offence, with a maximum penalty of 7 years imprisonment (s 269 Crimes Act 1961). New Zealand courts currently have no powers to disqualify drivers who physically assault another road user.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Fmo3DwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA118&amp;lpg=PA118&amp;dq=New+Zealand+courts+currently+have+no+powers+to+disqualify+drivers+who+physically+assault+another+road+user#v=onepage&amp;q=New%20Zealand%20courts%20currently%20have%20no%20powers%20to%20disqualify%20drivers%20who%20physically%20assault%20another%20road%20user&amp;f=false|title=101 Essays for IAS/ PCS &amp; other Competitive Exams|last=Experts|first=Disha|publisher=Disha Publications|isbn=9789386320940|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Singapore ===
Road rage is a criminal offence in Singapore. When found guilty, the offender may be jailed for up to two years and/or fined up to $5,000 for causing damage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Chong|first1=Elena|title=Bus driver jailed one week for road rage|url=http://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/courts-crime/bus-driver-jailed-one-week-for-road-rage|accessdate=1 December 2015|publisher=Straits Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== United Kingdom ===
In the UK, road rage can result in criminal penalties for assault or more serious offences against the person. The [[Public Order Act 1986]] can also apply to road rage. Sections 4A and 5 of the 1986 Act prohibit public acts likely to cause harassment, alarm or distress. Section 4 also prohibits threatening, abusive or insulting words or behaviour with intent to cause a victim to believe that violence will be used against himself or another.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/content.aspx?activeTextDocId=2236942 |title=Public Order Act 1986 |publisher=Statutelaw.gov.uk |date= |accessdate=2013-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
In some jurisdictions, such as the [[Commonwealth of Virginia]], it is easier to prosecute road rage as reckless driving instead of aggressive driving simply because the burden of proof does not require "intent" to successfully convict.

It is likely that those causing serious injury or death during "road rage" incidents will suffer more serious penalties than those applicable to similar outcomes from simple negligence. In April 2007, a Colorado driver was convicted of first-degree murder for causing the deaths of two motorists in November 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.denverpost.com/ci_5682631 |title=Road-rage killer unrepentant |publisher=The Denver Post |date= 2007-04-16|accessdate=2013-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rockymountainnews.com/drmn/local/article/0,1299,DRMN_15_5488641,00.html Road-rage driver offers blame at sentencing: Local News: The Rocky Mountain News] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070528020652/http://www.rockymountainnews.com/drmn/local/article/0,1299,DRMN_15_5488641,00.html |date=May 28, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He will serve a mandatory sentence of two consecutive life terms.

Fourteen [[U.S. state]]s have passed laws against aggressive driving. Only one state, [[California]], has turned "road rage" into a legal [[term of art]] by giving it a particular meaning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dmv.ca.gov/pubs/vctop/d06/vc13210.htm|title=V.C.

==U.S. rankings==
A 2007 study of the largest U.S. metropolitan areas concluded that the cities with the least courteous drivers (most road rage) are [[Miami]], [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]], [[New York City|New York]], [[Los Angeles]], and [[Boston]].

[[File:Ueber Sinn und Bedeutung Frege 1892.jpg|thumb|right|360px| ''Die Gleichheit fordert das Nachdenken heraus durch Fragen, die sich daran knüpfen und nicht ganz leicht zu beantworten sind''. Equality gives rise to challenging questions which are not altogether easy to answer]]

In the [[philosophy of language]], the distinction between '''sense and reference''' was an innovation of the German philosopher and mathematician [[Gottlob Frege]] in 1892 (in his paper "'''On Sense and Reference'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;"; German: "Über Sinn und Bedeutung"),&lt;ref name=A/&gt; reflecting the two ways he believed a [[singular term]] may have [[Meaning (philosophy of language)|meaning]].

The [[reference]] (or "referent"; ''Bedeutung'') of a proper name is the object it means or indicates (''bedeuten''), its sense (''Sinn'') is what the name expresses. The reference of a sentence is its [[truth value]], its sense is the thought that it expresses.&lt;ref name=A&gt;"On Sense and Reference" ["Über Sinn und Bedeutung"], ''[[Zeitschrift für Philosophie und philosophische Kritik]]'', vol. 100 (1892), pp. 25–50, esp. p. 31.{{primary-inline|date=December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Frege justified the distinction in a number of ways.
#Sense is something possessed by a name, whether or not it has a reference. For example, the name "[[Odysseus]]" is intelligible, and therefore has a sense, even though there is no individual object (its reference) to which the name corresponds.
#The sense of different names is different, even when their reference is the same. Frege argued that if an identity statement such as "[[Hesperus]] is the same planet as [[Phosphorus (morning star)|Phosphorus]]" is to be informative, the proper names flanking the identity sign must have a different meaning or sense. But clearly, if the statement is true, they must have the same reference.&lt;ref&gt;"On Sense and Reference", p. 25&lt;/ref&gt; The sense is a 'mode of presentation', which serves to illuminate only a single aspect of the referent.&lt;ref&gt;"On Sense and Reference", p. 27&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of [[analytic philosophy]] is traceable to Frege's philosophy of language.&lt;ref name=Speaks&gt;Jeff Speaks, [https://www3.nd.edu/~jspeaks/courses/2011-12/83104/handouts/frege-reference.pdf "Frege's theory of reference"] (2011)&lt;/ref&gt; Frege's views on logic (i.e., his idea that some parts of speech are complete by themselves, and are analogous to the [[Argument of a function|arguments]] of a [[Function (mathematics)|mathematical function]]) led to his views on a [[theory of reference]].&lt;ref name=Speaks/&gt;

==Background==
Frege developed his original theory of meaning in early works like ''[[Begriffsschrift]]'' ('concept script') of 1879 and ''[[The Foundations of Arithmetic|Grundlagen]]'' ('foundations of arithmetic') of 1884. On this theory, the meaning of a complete sentence consists in its being true or false,&lt;ref&gt;Gareth Evans, ''The Varieties of Reference'', Oxford: Clarendon 1982, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; and the meaning of each significant expression in the sentence is an extralinguistic entity which Frege called its ''Bedeutung'', literally 'meaning' or 'significance', but rendered by Frege's translators as 'reference', 'referent', '''M''eaning', 'nominatum', etc. Frege supposed that some parts of speech are complete by themselves, and are analogous to the [[Argument of a function|arguments]] of a [[Function (mathematics)|mathematical function]], but that other parts are incomplete, and contain an empty place, by analogy with the function itself.&lt;ref&gt;"Function and Concept", p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus 'Caesar conquered Gaul' divides into the complete term 'Caesar', whose reference is Caesar himself, and the incomplete term '—conquered Gaul', whose reference is a Concept. Only when the empty place is filled by a proper name does the reference of the completed sentence – its truth value – appear. This early theory of meaning explains how the significance or reference of a sentence (its truth value) depends on the significance or reference of its parts.

==Sense==
[[File:Mengs, Hesperus als Personifikation des Abends.jpg|thumb|right|160px|[[Hesperus]]]]
[[File:Jean-Marc Nattier, The Countess de Brac as Aurora (1741).jpg|thumb|right|140px|[[Phosphorus (morning star)|Phosphorus]]]] 
Frege introduced the notion of "sense" (German: ''Sinn'') to accommodate difficulties in his early theory of meaning.

First, if the entire significance of a sentence consists of its truth value, it follows that the sentence will have the same significance if we replace a word of the sentence with one having an identical reference, as this will not change its truth value.&lt;ref&gt;"On Sense and Reference", p. 32&lt;/ref&gt; The reference of the whole is determined by the reference of the parts. If ''the evening star'' has the same reference as ''the morning star'', it follows that ''the evening star is a body illuminated by the Sun'' has the same truth value as ''the morning star is a body illuminated by the Sun''. But it is possible for someone to think that the first sentence is true while also thinking that the second is false. Therefore, the thought corresponding to each sentence cannot be its reference, but something else, which Frege called its ''sense''.

Second, sentences that contain proper names with no reference cannot have a truth value at all. Yet the sentence 'Odysseus was set ashore at Ithaca while sound asleep' obviously has a sense, even though 'Odysseus' has no reference. The thought remains the same whether or not 'Odysseus' has a reference.&lt;ref&gt;"On Sense and Reference", p. 32&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, a thought cannot contain the objects that it is about. For example, Mont Blanc, 'with its snowfields', cannot be a component of the thought that Mont Blanc is more than 4,000 metres high. Nor can a thought about Etna contain lumps of solidified lava.&lt;ref&gt;See Frege's undated letter to [[Philip Jourdain]], published in ''Frege's Philosophical and Mathematical Correspondence'', ed. Gottfried Gabriel, Hans Hermes, Friedrich Kanbartel, Christian Thiel and Albet Veraart, transl. Hans Kaal, Oxford: Blackwell 1980. (See also Frege's letter to Russell dated 1904, in the same collection.)&lt;/ref&gt;

Frege's notion of sense is somewhat obscure, and neo-Fregeans have come up with different candidates for its role.&lt;ref&gt;Sam Cumming, [http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2013/entries/names/Names Names], ''Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Accounts based on the work of [[Rudolf Carnap|Carnap]]&lt;ref&gt;''[[Meaning and Necessity]]'', Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1947.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Alonzo Church|Church]]&lt;ref&gt;“A Formulation of the Logic of Sense and Denotation”, in P. Henle, M. Kallen, and S. K. Langer, eds., ''Structure, Method, and Meaning'', New York: Liberal Arts Press, 1951&lt;/ref&gt; treat sense as an [[intension]], or a function from [[possible world]]s to [[Extension (semantics)|extensions]]. For example, the intension of ‘number of planets’ is a function that maps any possible world to the number of planets in that world. [[John McDowell]] supplies cognitive and reference-determining roles.&lt;ref&gt;“On the Sense and Reference of a Proper Name”, ''Mind'', 86: 159–85, 1977.&lt;/ref&gt; Devitt&lt;ref&gt;''Designation'', New York: Columbia University Press, 1981.&lt;/ref&gt; treats senses as causal-historical chains connecting names to referents.

==Sense and description==
In his [[theory of descriptions]], [[Bertrand Russell]] held the view that most proper names in ordinary language are in fact disguised [[definite description]]s. For example, 'Aristotle' can be understood as "The pupil of Plato and teacher of Alexander," or by some other uniquely applying description. This is known as the [[descriptivist theory of names]]. Because Frege used definite descriptions in many of his examples, he is often taken to have endorsed the descriptivist theory. Thus Russell's theory of descriptions was conflated with Frege's theory of sense, and for most of the twentieth century this 'Frege-Russell' view was the orthodox view of proper name semantics. However, [[Saul Kripke]] argued compellingly against the descriptivist theory. According to Kripke,&lt;ref&gt;''Naming and Necessity'', Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1980, 48-9&lt;/ref&gt; proper names are [[rigid designator]]s which designate the same object in every possible world. Descriptions such as 'the President of the U.S. in 1970' do not designate the same in every possible world. For example, someone other than [[Richard Nixon]], e.g. [[Hubert Humphrey]], might have been the President in 1970. Hence a description (or cluster of descriptions) cannot be a rigid designator, and thus a proper name cannot ''mean'' the same as a description.&lt;ref&gt;''Naming and Necessity'' p.57&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the Russellian descriptivist reading of Frege has been rejected by many scholars, in particular by [[Gareth Evans (philosopher)|Gareth Evans]] in ''The Varieties of Reference''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Evans|first=Gareth|title=The Varieties of Reference|year=1982|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|editor=John McDowell}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by [[John McDowell]] in "The Sense and Reference of a Proper Name,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=McDowell|first=John|title=On the Sense and Reference of a Proper Name|journal=Mind|date=April 1977|volume=86|series=New Series|issue=342}}&lt;/ref&gt; following [[Michael Dummett]], who argued that Frege's notion of sense should not be equated with a description. Evans further developed this line, arguing that a sense without a referent was not possible. He and McDowell both take the line that Frege's discussion of empty names, and of the idea of sense without reference, are inconsistent, and that his apparent endorsement of descriptivism rests only on a small number of imprecise and perhaps offhand remarks. And both point to the power that the sense-reference distinction ''does'' have (i.e., to solve at least the first two problems), even if it is not given a descriptivist reading.

==Translation of ''Bedeutung''==
As noted above, translators of Frege have rendered the German ''Bedeutung'' in various ways. The term 'reference' has been the most widely adopted, but this fails to capture the meaning of the original German ('meaning' or 'significance'), and does not reflect the decision to standardise key terms across different editions of Frege's works published by [[Wiley-Blackwell#Blackwell Publishing history|Blackwell]].&lt;ref&gt;According to Beaney (''The Frege Reader'', Oxford: Blackwell 1997, p. 36) 'the decision was taken at a meeting in the early 1970s attended by Michael Dummett, Peter Geach, William Kneale, Roger White and a representative from Blackwell. The translation of ''Bedeutung'' by 'meaning' was unanimously agreed after lengthy discussion'.&lt;/ref&gt; The decision was based on the principle of [[exegetical neutrality]], namely that 'if at any point in a text there is a passage that raises for the native speaker legitimate questions of [[exegesis]], then, if at all possible, a translator should strive to confront the reader of his version with the same questions of exegesis and not produce a version which in his mind resolves those questions'.&lt;ref&gt;Long, P. and White, A., 'On the Translation of Frege's ''Bedeutung'': A Reply to Dr. Bell', ''Analysis'' 40 pp. 196-202, 1980, p. 196. See also Bell, D., "On the Translation of Frege's ''Bedeutung''", ''Analysis'' Vol. 40, No. 4 (Oct., 1980), pp. 191-195.&lt;/ref&gt; The term 'meaning' best captures the standard German meaning of ''Bedeutung'', and Frege's own use of the term sounds as odd when translated into English as it does in German. Moreover, 'meaning' captures Frege's early use of ''Bedeutung'' well,&lt;ref&gt;Beaney, p. 37&lt;/ref&gt; and it would be problematic to translate Frege's early use as 'meaning' and his later use as 'reference', suggesting a change in terminology not evident in the original German.

==Precursors==
===Antisthenes===
The Greek philosopher [[Antisthenes]], a pupil of [[Socrates]], apparently distinguished "a general object that can be aligned with the meaning of the utterance” from “a particular object of extensional reference." This "suggests that he makes a distinction between sense and reference."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Prince|first=Susan |title=Antisthenes of Athens: Texts, Translations, and Commentary|publisher=University of Michigan Press |year=2015}} p. 20&lt;/ref&gt; 
The principal basis of this claim is a quotation in [[Alexander of Aphrodisias]]'s “Comments on [[Aristotle]]'s 'Topics'” with a three-way distinction: 
# the semantic medium, δι' ὧν λέγουσι
# an object external to the semantic medium, περὶ οὗ λέγουσιν
# the direct indication of a thing, σημαίνειν … τὸ …&lt;ref&gt;Prince 2015, pp. 518–522 (Antisthenes' literary remains: t. 153B.1).&lt;/ref&gt;

===John Stuart Mill===
The sense-reference distinction is commonly confused with that between [[connotation]] and [[denotation]], which originates with [[John Stuart Mill]].&lt;ref&gt;See section §5 of book I, chapter i of Mill's [[A System of Logic]]&lt;/ref&gt; According to Mill, a common term like 'white' ''denotes'' all white things, as snow, paper. But according to Frege, a common term does not refer to any individual white thing, but rather to an abstract Concept (''Begriff''). We must distinguish between the relation of reference, which holds between a proper name and the object it refers to, such as between the name 'Earth', and the planet [[Earth]], and the relation of 'falling under', such as when the Earth falls under the concept ''planet''. The relation of a proper name to the object it designates is direct, whereas a word like 'planet' has no such direct relation at all to the Earth at all, but only to a concept that the Earth falls under. Moreover, judging ''of'' anything that it falls under this concept is not in any way part of our knowledge of what the word 'planet' means.&lt;ref&gt;Frege, "A critical elucidation of some points in E. Schroeder's ''Vorlesungen Ueber Die Algebra der Logik'', ''Archiv fur systematische Philosophie'' 1895, pp. 433-456, transl. Geach, in Geach &amp; Black 86-106.{{primary-inline|date=December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The distinction between connotation and denotation is closer to that between Concept and Object, than to that between 'sense' and 'reference'.

[[File:2008-09 alphen geen geweld.JPG|thumb|The [[ladybug street tile]] is a symbol against "senseless violence" in the [[Netherlands]] and is often placed on the sites of deadly crimes.]]
'''Senseless violence''' or '''zinloos geweld''' ([[Dutch language|Dutch]]) is a term frequently used by among others the media, politicians and [[Non-governmental organization|NGOs]] to define the nature of several shocking events in [[Belgium]] and the [[Netherlands]] in recent years. The use of the term is politically charged and may not reflect any unique elements of any particular crime given that label.

The term expresses the perceived senselessness of the occurred acts of [[violence]]; the perpetrator and the victim do not know each other, the violence seems not to be motivated by greed or other common factors. The violence occurs suddenly and often under the influence of alcohol.

==Origin of the term==
The term "senseless violence", in the meaning used in this article, was first used in 1997 by Cees Bangma, district chief of the Dutch police unit Midden-Friesland. Before 1997 the term did not carry the same moral connotation in Belgian and Dutch culture, and typically referred to overseas warzone violence. Bangma used it in a letter written to the [[Leeuwarder Courant]], a [[Frisia]]n newspaper in which he made an appeal to the Dutch population to have a minute of silence for [[Meindert Tjoelker]], who was killed on 13 September 1997. This minute was necessary "to make it clear to everyone that the Frisian society does not accept senseless violence". A wave of reactions followed, which also included [[media hype]]. As a consequence, much more attention was spent to every similar case of violence, which led to the perception that violence was on the increase.

A political group ''Landelijke Stichting Tegen Zinloos Geweld'' (national foundation against senseless violence) was created and people created the lady bug tile as a memorial or reminder against senseless violence. The group send guest teachers to schools and sport associations, but became rather inactive since ca. 2009.

==Criticism==
The term is often criticized. Some people think that violence is never legitimate and consider the term to be a tautology. Others say that the term has never been clearly defined and does not help to understand a peticular phenomenon. Others point out that the term is or can be misused by politicians who strive for more repressive measures against crimes.

In 2016, the national newspaper NRC reported about a recent case of youngsters mistreating a homeless person. The newspaper quoted a spokesperson of the police who said that hardly any violence happens ''out of the blue''. Criminologists have started to use the term ''uitgaansgeweld'' instead, violence occurring ''going out'' in the evening to pubs and bars. Because of the local approach there are no recent national figures about the phenomenon, according to an expert.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nrc.nl/nieuws/2016/09/05/dodelijke-klappen-op-de-wallen-4147978-a1519868|title=‘Zinloos geweld’, bestaat dat nog?|work=NRC|access-date=2018-09-11|language=nl}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Belgium==
While there have been multiple isolated cases of fatal senseless violence in the decade since 1997, the number of deadly incidents surged since April in 2006. The following is a non-exhaustive list of deadly incidents since 1998:

* November 28, 1998: [[Patrick Mombaerts]] (died in [[Brussels]] after being beaten by very young robbers, who were sentenced to [[community service]] only).

* April 2002: unidentified woman (died of a heart attack after being chased and attacked by youths in [[Brussels]]).
* May 7, 2002: [[Ahmed Isnasni and Habiba El Hajji]] (shot to death in [[Brussels]] by their neighbour [[Hendrik Vyt]], who then killed himself).
* October 2002: unidentified elderly woman (died from wounds suffered in a street robbery in [[Brussels]]).

* July 2, 2006: [[Philibert Mees]] (stabbed to death in his [[Mechelen]] house by his neighbour).
* October 21, 2006: [[Eddy Sabbe]] (beaten to death during a robbery by immigrants).
* November 3, 2006: [[Mohamed Benzil]] (killed after being pushed in front of an [[Antwerp]] tram by immigrants, possibly in a case of [[road rage]]).
* February 3, 2007: [[Bart Bonroy]] (18-year-old stabbed to death in [[Ostend]] by Kenny B. after he refused to give a [[cigarette]]).
* February 20, 2007: [[Yannick Amba-Bongelo]] (17-year-old [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|Congolese]] who was stabbed to death by a gang of 30 youths during [[Mardi Gras]] in [[Binche]]).
* September 1, 2007: yet unnamed elderly man (stabbed to death in broad daylight in a busy street in [[Brussels]] by a 28-year-old man).
* December 4, 2007: [[Kitty Van Nieuwenhuyse]] (23-year-old police officer shot to death in her patrol car when responding to a burglary).
* April, 2012: An [[MIVB]] employee died after being struck by a man, leading to a multiple-day-long strike by the Brussels transport services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://acv-delijn-gent.blogspot.com//2012/04/zinloos-geweld-op-controleur-mivb.html|title=ACV DE LIJN OOST-VLAANDEREN|publisher=acv-delijn-gent.blogspot.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Netherlands==

* August 21, 1983: [[Kerwin Duinmeijer]] (stabbed to death in a racism related case)
* October 22, 2002: [[Death of René Steegmans|René Steegmans]] (beaten to death after asking respect for an elderly lady)

In March 2010, while still a pastor, he founded aHomeinHaiti.org as a subsidiary of Courageous Church and used [[eBay]] and [[Twitter]] to raise $1.5&amp;nbsp;million to send tents to Haiti after the [[2010 Haiti earthquake]].

==Activism==
King has written extensively about incidents in the Black Lives Matter movement, gaining prominence during the events following the [[shooting of Michael Brown]].

Rice, a 12-year-old resident of [[Cleveland]], [[Ohio]], was killed in 2014 by two Cleveland city policemen after they responded to a complaint "of a male black sitting on a swing and pointing a gun at people."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqBqg43WN34|title=Tamir Rice Shooting – Cleveland Police Dispatch Radio|date=November 24, 2014|work=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Washington Post"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Izadi|first1=Elahe|last2=Holley|first2=Peter|title=Video shows Cleveland officer shooting 12-year-old Tamir Rice within seconds|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2014/11/26/officials-release-video-names-in-fatal-police-shooting-of-12-year-old-cleveland-boy| accessdate= November 26, 2014|work=The Washington Post|date=November 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=McCarthy, Tom|location= New York|url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2014/nov/26/tamir-rice-video-shows-boy-shot-police-cleveland|title=Tamir Rice: video shows boy, 12, shot 'seconds' after police confronted child]|work=The Guardian|access-date= November 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

King and the Rice family's new legal counsel, [[Benjamin Crump]], then started a second charity drive with the proceeds going directly to the family. An additional $25,000 was raised.&lt;ref name=WAPO3/&gt;&lt;ref name=KingMedium&gt;{{cite web| url= https://medium.com/@ShaunKing/a-complete-accounting-of-every-dollar-raised-by-shaun-king-throughout-the-black-lives-matter-fba726f6d8af#.ot7h89air |title=A complete accounting of every dollar raised by Shaun King throughout the Black Lives Matter Movement|author=King, Shaun|website=Medium.com|date= December 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==

===High school assault===
One of his experiences in high school was what he considered a [[hate crime]] assault.&lt;ref name="FRB"/&gt; King stated a "dozen rednecks" had beaten him and the injuries caused him to miss a portion of two years of high school due to multiple spinal surgeries.&lt;ref name="RBL"/&gt; A band teacher, two fellow students from King's high school, as well as King's wife, posted their recollection of the event to [[Facebook]], backing King's account.&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;{{cite web|work=[[The New York Times]]|title=Activist Shaun King Denies Claims He Lied About Race and Assault |first= Ashley| last= Southall |date=August 19, 2015|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/20/us/activist-shaun-king-denies-claims-he-lied-about-race-and-assault.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="vox 2015-08-19"&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.vox.com/2015/8/19/9180389/the-shaun-king-controversy-explained| publisher=[[Vox (website)|Vox]]| first= German| last= Lopez|date=August 21, 2015|title=The Shaun King controversy, explained}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nydn"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/black-lives-matter-activist-shaun-king-white-article-1.2330658|title=Rachel Dolezal 2.0?

The detective who investigated the case in 1995 described King's injuries as "minor". The associated police report noted that the incident revolved around a fight involving only one other student who defended his girlfriend after being allegedly threatened by King. The report did not indicate the incident was racially motivated. There is no mention of a "hate crime" either with local police or with the [[FBI]].&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dailycaller.com/2015/07/21/leading-ferguson-activists-hate-crime-claim-disputed-by-police-report-detective|title=Ferguson Activist's Hate Crime Claim Disputed By Police|work=[[The Daily Caller]]|last=Ross|first=Chuck|date=July 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Keith Broughton, the investigating detective, said he interviewed six witnesses put forth by the school's principal, including a teacher who broke up the fight. All of them described it as a one-on-one altercation.&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt;

===Questions regarding race===
In August 2015, [[Milo Yiannopoulos]] questioned King's biracial identity in an article for [[Breitbart News]]. Yiannopoulos reported that King's birth certificate lists Naomi Fleming and Jeffrey Wayne King (both of whom are white) as King's parents&lt;ref name=TWP&gt;{{cite web |title=Activist Shaun King says man on his birth certificate isn't his biological father |date=August 20, 2015|last1= Lowery| first1= Wesley| last2= Miller| first2= Michael |work=[[The Washington Post]] |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2015/08/20/activist-shaun-king-says-man-on-birth-certificate-isnt-his-biological-father/}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that a police report cited King's race as "white."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gq.com/story/shaun-king-interview-breitbart-black-lives-matter|title=Shaun King Speaks Out Against Breitbart's Racial Allegations|work=[[GQ]]|author=Sharlet, Jeff|date=August 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

King said that the man listed on his birth certificate is his adoptive, not biological father, and that his mother has told him his biological father is a light-skinned black man.&lt;ref name=DKosRaceKing&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailykos.com/story/2015/08/20/1413881/-Race-love-hate-and-me-A-distinctly-American-story|title=Race, love, hate, and me: A distinctly American story| last= King| first= Shaun| publisher= [[Daily Kos]]|date=August 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt; In various interviews with King's family and classmates conducted by the mainstream media, they stated that they understood King to be biracial growing up.&lt;ref name="CNN20150820"/&gt;&lt;ref name=TWP/&gt;&lt;ref name=IJR/&gt;	 	
 	
After being contacted by reporters, the police officer who listed King's race as "white" was interviewed by the [[Independent Journal Review]] following Yiannopoulos's article for Breitbart. The officer recalled the case and stated that he believed King to be biracial, and that everyone who knew King presumed he was mixed. He went on to state that he had only listed King as white because he is light-skinned, and biracial was not an option on his form.&lt;ref name=IJR/&gt; King and his supporters expressed concern that such questions were an attempt to distract from the Black Lives Matter movement.&lt;ref name="CNN20150820"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2015/08/20/us/shaun-king-controversy|title=Black Lives Matter activist Shaun King addresses race reports|author=Cris, Doug|date=August 20, 2015|publisher=[[CNN]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Rogers, Katie|title=In Questions Over Shaun King's Race, Activists See Challenge to Black Lives Matter Movement|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/22/us/in-questions-over-shaun-kings-race-activists-see-challenge-to-black-lives-matter-movement.html?_r=0|accessdate=September 14, 2015|work=The New York Times|date=August 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Technoself studies''', commonly referred to as '''TSS''', is an emerging, [[interdisciplinarity]]  domain of scholarly research dealing with all aspects of [[human]] [[identity (social science)|identity]] in a technological society&lt;ref name="Lupp 1-25"&gt;Luppicini pp. 1–25&lt;/ref&gt; focusing on the changing nature of relationships between the human and technology. As new and constantly changing experiences of human identity emerge due to constant technological change, technoself studies seeks to map and analyze these mutually influential developments with a focus on identity, rather than technical developments. Therefore, the self is a key concept of TSS. The term "technoself", advanced by Luppicini (2013), broadly denotes evolving human identity as a result of the adoption of new technology, while avoiding ideological or philosophical biases inherent in other related terms including [[#Cyborg|cyborg]], [[#Posthuman|posthuman]], [[#Transhuman|transhuman]], techno-human,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/techno-human-condition | title=The Techno-Human Condition | publisher=MIT Press | author2=Daniel Sarewitz | author1=Braden R. Allenby}}&lt;/ref&gt; beman (also known as bio-electric human), [[#Digital identity and virtual life|digital identity]], [[#Real and virtual identities|avatar]], and [[#Homotechnicus|homotechnicus]] though Luppicini acknowledges that these categories "capture important aspects of human identity".&lt;ref&gt;Luppicini p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; Technoself is further elaborated and explored in Luppicini's "''Handbook of Research on Technoself: Identity in a Technological Environment''".

==History and contextual framing==

Technoself evolved from early groundwork in identity studies, [[philosophy of mind]], and [[cognitive science]].&lt;ref name="Lupp 1-25"/&gt; [[René Descartes]] is often credited as one of the first identity theorists of [[Modernity]] to question the material world and the certainty of knowledge from the self. Despite heavy criticism, the question he posed regarding the necessary relation between the mind and body is still considered a prevalent theme in contemporary discussions of identity and technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Dixon, D.|year=1990|title=Man after man: An anthropology of the future}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another major development in identity studies came from early [[social psychology]], [[sociology]] and [[psychoanalysis]]. Beginning with [[Freud]], the psychoanalytic tradition shed some light on the dynamics of identity and personality development. [[Goffman|Erving Goffman]] expanded the inquiry of identity with his [[Dramaturgy (sociology)|dramaturgical theory]], which emphasized the centrality of the social realm and the notion of self-presentation to identity. Later, [[Michel Foucault|Foucault]] further expanded the area of inquiry by contemplating how technologies could facilitate the emergence of new ways of relating to oneself.&lt;ref name="Abbas, Y. 2009"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Abbas|first1=Y.|last2=Dervin|first2=F.|year=2009|title=Digital Technologies of the Self|location=Newcastle|publisher=Cambridge Scholars Publishing}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most entrenched area of technoself studies is revolved around [[ontological]] considerations and conceptualizations of technoself.&lt;ref name="Lupp 1-25"/&gt; The effort to identify the essence of human being is frequent in philosophical circles and is entrenched within emerging theoretical scholarship on technoself.&lt;ref name="Lupp 1-25"/&gt; DeGrazia's (2005) examination  on identify/numerical identity to shed light on the ethics of human enhancement. According to DeGrazia, human identity is divided into two parts: 1) numerical identity (concerns the continuity of an individual as the same object over time or across procedure), and 2) narrative identity (concerns the changes in self-perception experienced by an individual over time).&lt;ref name="DeGrazia, D. 2005"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = DeGrazia | first1 = D | year = 2005 | title = Enhancement technologies and human identity | url = | journal = Journal of Medicine &amp; Philosophy | volume = 30 | issue = 3| pages = 261–283 | doi=10.1080/03605310590960166}}&lt;/ref&gt; By dividing human identity into two parts, DeGrazia is facilitating a discussion on the ethics of human enhancements.&lt;ref name="DeGrazia, D. 2005"/&gt; Meanwhile, Croon Fors&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:144413/FULLTEXT01.pdf|title=Being-with Information Technology: Critical explorations beyond use and design|author=Anna Croon Fors|isbn=9173051179|publisher=Department of Informatics, Umeå University|location= Umeå, Sweden}}&lt;/ref&gt;(2012) research on the entanglement of the self and digitalization have helped frame ontological considerations related to the conceptualization of technoself studies.&lt;ref name="Lupp 1-25"/&gt; Furthermore, the changing nature of identity is a common theme within technoself studies.&lt;ref name="Lupp 1-25"/&gt; As a result, this has given way for scholars to analyze questions such as: How are advances in sensing technologies, biometrics, and genetics changing the way we define and recognize identity? How are technologies changing the way people define themselves and present themselves in society? These types of questions are being heavily analyzed as the conceptualization of identity is changing rapidly.

Central to the understanding of the development of technoself studies as a field of research is the idea that human identity is shaped by the adoption of new technologies and the relationship between humans and technology. Advancements in digital technology have recently forced researchers to consider the conception of the [[self]] in relation to the increasing reliance of society on the use of technologies (such as cellphones, tablets, and [[social media]]) in daily tasks in peoples' personal and professional lives.&lt;ref name="Lupp 1-25"/&gt; New technologies, particularly [[computer-mediated communication]] tools, have raised questions related to identity in relationship to privacy issues, virtual identity boundaries, [[Internet fraud|online fraud]], citizen surveillance, etc. These issues come as our perspective on technology shifts from one of functionality to one of interaction. According to John Lester, in the future, "we won't simply enjoy using our tools, we will come to care for them".&lt;ref name="Lupp 1-25"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Turkle/&gt;

==Related terms==

===Noeme=== 
The noeme is a term coined in 2011 by biogerontologist [[Marios Kyriazis]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://biologicalimmortality.blogspot.co.uk/2011_03_01_archive.html|title=Evolutionary Replicators in the Global Brain|date=March 7, 2011|work=Human Indefinite Lifespans}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it denotes a "combination of a distinct physical brain function and that of an outsourced virtual one".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Klemm WR|title=Making a Scientific Case for Conscious Agency and Free Will|publisher=Elsevier|year=2016|page=68|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=MTiOCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA68&amp;lpg=PA68&amp;dq=noeme+kyriazis&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=XUhVnAeio4&amp;sig=dZzl1CPJQyA4oRbAPF1A9Faha0o&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjborH9jKLMAhVEIcAKHcqqAl4Q6AEIKjAE#v=onepage&amp;q=noeme%20kyriazis&amp;f=false|isbn=9780128052891}}&lt;/ref&gt; A noeme is the intellectual "networked presence" of an individual within the [[global brain]], a meaningful synergy between each individual human, their social interactions and artificial agents, globally connected to other noemes through digital communications technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmc = 4319389 | pmid=25705180 | doi=10.3389/fnsys.2015.00007 | volume=9 | title=Systems neuroscience in focus: from the human brain to the global brain? | year=2015 | journal=Front Syst Neurosci | pages=7 | last1 = Kyriazis | first1 = M}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kyriazis further clarifies&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kyriazis | first1 = M | year = 2015 | title = Technological integration and hyperconnectivity: Tools for promoting extreme human lifespans | url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cplx.21626/abstract | journal = Complexity | volume = 20 | issue = 6| pages = 15–24 | doi=10.1002/cplx.21626| arxiv = 1402.6910 | bibcode = 2015Cmplx..20f..15K }}&lt;/ref&gt; that: ''"...The noeme is structurally coupled with its medium, i.e. the computer/internet. It continuously generates its own organisation and specifies its operation and content. As a self-organising system it adjusts to external influences and reinvents itself in order to adapt to its environment i.e. it reproduces (self-replicates) horizontally in a process that can be termed 'noemic reproduction'. This digital intellectual manifestation of a person, if successful, will lead to others copying it, thus noemes are replicating... A noeme is not just a collection of single ideas or solitary intellectual achievements. It is the total sum of all individual cognitive efforts and active information-sharing accomplishments of a person, the intellectual standing of a person within the [[Global brain]].''

===Cyborg===

A [[cyborg]] (cybernetic organism) is a term referring to individuals with "both biological and artificial parts." Cyborgs are known as being half-human, half machine organisms, due to the fact that they are always connected with technology. This term, which was coined in 1960 by [[Manfred Clynes]], refers to and acknowledges those beings whose abilities have been enhanced due to the presence and advancement of technology. The notion of cyborg has played a part in breaking down boundaries between humans and non-humans living within a technologically advanced society. For example, those who have installed pacemakers, hearing aids, artificial body parts, cochlear implants as well as other technologies that may aid in enhancing an organisms abilities and capacities to perform, either physically or mentally.&lt;ref name="Lupp 1-25"/&gt;
[[Hugh Herr]], an American rock climber, engineer, and biophysicist, has successfully invented the next generation of cyborg (bionic limbs and robotic prosthetics).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Strickland, E.|date=May 27, 2014|title=We Will End Disability by Becoming Cyborgs|accessdate=November 5, 2014|url=http://spectrum.ieee.org/biomedical/bionics/we-will-end-disability-by-becoming-cyborgs}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the head of the Media Lab's Biomechatronics group in MIT, he shared his experience and presented the team achievement first time in a [[TED (conference)|TED]] talk show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media| url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CDsNZJTWw0w | title=The new bionics that let us run, climb and dance | accessdate=May 15, 2016 | people=Hugh Herr |via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Transhuman===
[[Transhuman]] is a concept that emerged as a result of the transhumanist movement which is centred around the notion of improving the abilities of human beings mainly through both 'scientific and technical means.' Unlike the posthuman concept, the notion of transhuman is based on human augmentation but does not commit itself to positing a new separate species.&lt;ref name="Lupp 1-25"/&gt; The philosophy of [[transhumanism]] was developed in the 1990s by British philosopher [[Max More]] who articulated the principles of transhumanism as a futurist philosophy. However, the transhuman philosophy has also been subject to scrutiny by prominent scholars such as [[Francis Fukuyama]].

===Posthuman===

[[Posthuman]] is a concept that aims towards signifying and characterizing a fresh and enhanced type of being. This organism is highly representative of a being that embraces drastic capabilities that exceed current human capabilities that are presently defining human beings. This posthuman state of identity has mainly resulted from the advancement of technological presence. According to Luppicini, posthuman capabilities "suggest a new type of being over and above human. This compromises the neutrality needed for a clear conception of human identity in the face of human-technological integration." This concept aims towards enabling a brighter future concerned with gaining a better perception of the world through various viewpoints.&lt;ref name="Lupp 1-25"/&gt;

===Homotechnicus===

Homo technicus is a term "first coined by Galvin in 2003 to help refine the definition of human beings to more accurately reflect the evolving condition of human beings intertwined within advancing technological society".&lt;ref name="Technoself 2013"&gt;"Handbook of Research on Technoself: Identity in a Technological Society", ''Information Science Reference'' (2013), by Rocci Luppicini.&lt;/ref&gt; It refers to the notion that human beings are technological by nature and evolve simultaneously with technology. Galvin states in his article titled "On Technoethics", "mankind cannot do away with the technical dimension, going even to the
point of considering this part of its constitution: mankind is technical by nature. Technology is not an
addition to man but is, in fact, one of the ways in which mankind distinguishes itself from animals."&lt;ref name="Galvan"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Galván, José María|date=December 2003|title=On Technoethics|url=http://bib26.pusc.it/teo/p_galvan/technotehics%20ieee%20tradotto.pdf|journal=IEEE Robotics and Automation Magazine|volume=10|issue=4|pages=58–63}}&lt;/ref&gt; Luppicini builds upon the concept of homo technicus in his book ''Handbook of Research on Technoself: Identity in a Technological Society''. Luppicini feels that the notion of homo technicus contributes to the conception of humans as technoselves in two ways. First it helps to solidify the idea of technology as being a key component in defining humans and society and secondly it demonstrates the importance of technology as a human creation that aligns with human values.&lt;ref name="Technoself 2013"/&gt; He further goes onto explain that human interactions with the material world around them helps to create meaning and this unique way of creating meaning has affected how humans have evolved as a species.

Note: the term homo technicus was coined earlier than 2003.  For instance, it was used by Russell E. Willis in his 1990 PhD dissertation for Emory University: Toward a Theological Ethics of Technology: An analysis in Dialogue with Jacques Ellul, James Gustafson, and the Philosophy of Technology.  It was later used by Willis in "Complex Responsibility in an Age of Technology," in Living Responsibly in Community, ed. Fredrick E. Glennon, et al. (University Press of America, 1997): 251ff.  In both publications homo technicus is offered as a model for the responsible self in an age of pervasive technology.

===Avatar===
[[Avatar (computing)|Avatars]] represent the individual, the individual's alter ego, or character(s) within virtual environments controlled by a human user. Avatars provide a unique opportunity to experiment with one's identity construction within virtual worlds (Turkle, 1995) and to do so with others". Examples of avatars can include personas in online games or virtual life simulations such as Second Life.

===Technohuman===
A new hybrid form of creature that results from an intertwinement between human and machine.

===Technosapien===
A techno-sapien would be a slang term for a human being who is familiar and comfortable with technology. Someone who has the latest gadgets and electronic machinery would be techno-sapien.

===Digital identity===
[[Digital identity]] is the data that uniquely describes a person or a thing and contains information about the subject's relationships. The social identity that an internet user establishes through digital identities in cyberspace is referred to as online identity.

==Key areas and issues==
The areas of focus in TSS are: philosophical inquiry and theoretical framing, [[digital identity]] and [[virtual life]], [[human enhancement]] [[Technology|technologies]], and their regulation.&lt;ref name="Lupp 1-25"/&gt; These areas of study have been influenced by extensive research, and input from an editorial advisory and review board over the course of several years.&lt;ref name="Lupp 1-25"/&gt;

===Digital identity and virtual life===
Digital identity and virtual life looks at how individuals explore, develop and represent their identities in online, virtual, or mediated environments. Research on virtual life and digital identities is concerned not only with how individuals relate to their own mediated identities, but also with how they relate to those of others. With the current popularity of [[social networking service]] sites, it is no surprise that TSS scholars have also begun studying the effects that such constant and mediated social connections have on identity. Topics that fall under this category have included [[intellectual disability]], [[gender identity]], and [[mass media]] in sport.

Critical areas of research include: how individuals treat the identity of others in an online space; how people use media to develop and project their identity; and how digital representation can alter life meaning and identity (Luppicini, 2013). Such research examines the advantages and disadvantages of online life and digital identity construction.&lt;ref name=LuppicicniP15P16&gt;Luppicini, pp. 15–16&lt;/ref&gt;

Areas of digital identity and virtual life have become quite popular, e.g. online avatars. Scholars are now focused on the role avatars play in identity exploration, priming behaviours, and self-presentation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Dunn | first1 = R. | last2 = Guadagno | first2 = R. | year = 2012 | title = My avatar and me - Gender and personality predictors of avatar-self discrepancy | url = | journal = Computers in Human Behavior | volume = 28 | issue = | pages = 97–106 | doi=10.1016/j.chb.2011.08.015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other research looks at the use of [[communication]] technologies by immigrant individuals as part of a digital [[diaspora]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Elias | first1 = N. | last2 = Lemish | first2 = D. | year = 2009 | title = Spinning the web of identity: Internet's roles in immigrant adolescents' search of identity | url = | journal = New Media and Society | volume = 11 | issue = 4| pages = 533–551 | doi=10.1177/1461444809102959}}&lt;/ref&gt; These scholars examine a trend in which diasporic immigrants who feel disconnected from their cultural identities have turned to digital technologies as a way to reconnect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Papacharissi, Z.|year=2011|title=A networked self: Identity, community, and culture on social networking sites|location=New York, NY|publisher=Routledge}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "technoself" is often used interchangeably with "virtual self". In this case, technoself is used to refer to a virtual manifestation of one's self.  The ability to project one's self into a virtual world allows users to control their appearance and personality. Users are able to customize their virtual identity and craft a persona to their liking. The malleability of online identities allows users to not only create their own virtual self, but also to continually change and mold their online selves in ways impossible to do with their real identities. Users can edit and change their virtual selves' appearance and behavior to control other users' perception of them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Seung-A|first=Annie Jin|title=The virtual malleable self and the virtual identity discrepancy model: Investigative frameworks for virtual possible selves and others in avatar-based identity construction and social interaction|journal=Computers in Human Behavior|date=November 2012|volume=28|issue=6|page=2161|doi=10.1016/j.chb.2012.06.022}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ability to create and change your identity in this way, is due to anonymity. [[Anonymity]] is a paramount and dynamic feature of virtual social interaction within the online [[public sphere]]. As individuals are not required to reveal their real identity, they are able to explore new and undiscovered aspects of themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Yee | first1 = N | year = 2009 | title = The Proteus Effect: Implications of Transformed Digital Self-Representation on Online and Offline Behavior | url = | journal = Communication Research | volume = 36 | issue = 2| pages = 285–312 | doi=10.1177/0093650208330254}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this expansion of the self, anonymous individuals may try on various identities which break traditional social norms, without fear of retribution or judgment. This contributes to the creation of 'super-selves', through which individuals may amplify aspects of their projected identities in order to form an ideal expression of the self.&lt;ref name="Abbas, Y. 2009"/&gt; The fact that the vast majority of virtual encounters are anonymous in nature allows a 'strangers on a train' phenomenon to
take place. Through invented and unknown personae, individuals are able to engage in self-disclosure, transvestism, and fantasies. However, this freedom may not be absolute, as there are many risks in participating in an online community, including identity theft and the potential linkage between anonymous and manifest identities.&lt;ref name=Turkle/&gt; Anonymity also may have legal ramifications, making it difficult for law enforcement to maintain control over online communities. Tracking down online law-breakers is difficult when their identity is unknown. Anonymity also frees individuals so that they are able to behave in socially undesirable and harmful ways, which can result in forms of hate speech and cruel online behaviour. Lastly, anonymity also diminishes the integrity of information, and as a result, diminished the overall trust of online environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|last1=Johnson|first1=D.|last2=Miller|first2=K.|year=1998|title=Anonymity, Pseudonymity, or Inescapable Identity on the Net|conference=Ethics and Social Impact: Privacy Issue|volume=28|issue=2|doi= 10.1145/276755.276774 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many online users choose to attempt anonymity through the use of avatars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Avatar|year=2012|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/avatar?s=t|work=Dictionary.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Users associate themselves with avatars as digital representatives within a duplicated and simulated [[virtual community]]. The user's body is essentially plugged in within the avatar world, thereby creating the illusion of infinite "space" behind the computer screen. As a result, they provide the opportunity for users to manipulate their worlds and the spaces and objects with which they interact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Davis, K.|year=2011|title=Tensions of identity in a networked era: Young people's perspectives on the risks and rewards of online self-expression|journal=New Media &amp; Society|volume=14|issue=4|pages=634–651|doi=10.1177/1461444811422430}}&lt;/ref&gt; Participation in online communities has resulted in the creation of a virtual economy based on the semantic value of digital products.&lt;ref name="Chen, Y. 2012"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Chen | first1 = Y. | last2 = Huang | first2 = S. | last3 = Shang | first3 = R. | year = 2012 | title = A private versus a public space: Anonymity and buying decorative symbolic goods for avatars in a virtual world | doi = 10.1016/j.chb.2012.06.030 | journal = Computers in Human Behavior | volume = 28 | issue = 6| pages = 2227–2235 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This form of online consumerism is centered on the creation of avatars as extensions of the self. The purchase of symbolic goods for these avatars relates to the emotional and social value that the user holds for these items. These products may indicate roles or personality traits of players within a community and consist primarily of task oriented and nonfunctional items.&lt;ref name="Chen, Y. 2012"/&gt;

Luppicini argues that the rise of online life creates serious questions on the advantages and disadvantages of [[Online community|online communities]] along with the challenges to online identity construction (Turkle, 1999). He notes the negative influence of the impersonality of virtual communities on offline interaction and the consequence of [[Internet addiction disorder|Internet addiction]]. [[Sherry Turkle]] states: "We discovered the network – the world of connectivity – to be uniquely suited to the overworked and overscheduled life it makes possible. And now we look to the network to defend us against loneliness even as we want it to control the intensity of our connections".&lt;ref&gt;Luppicini, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;

===Privacy and surveillance of the technoself===
{{See also|Surveillance#Psychological/social effects}}
[[Computer networking]] and smart technologies such as [[radio frequency identification]] (RFID), [[geographical information systems]] (GIS), and [[global positioning systems]] (GPS) are providing new tools and techniques for monitoring individuals and their behavior.&lt;ref name="Lupp 1-25"/&gt; The rise in these types of technologies has raised concerns over the invasion of privacy, and the misuse of information.&lt;ref name="Lupp 1-25"/&gt;  That is because the networked identity of technoselves can be exploited by third parties who may want to gain access and control over personal information.&lt;ref name="Lupp 1-25"/&gt; Moreover, the implications of the sophisticated technologies for identifying and tracking&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.sscqueens.org/sites/default/files/2005_03_Loctech.pdf | title=Location Technologies: Mobility, Surveillance and Privacy | publisher=Surveillance Studies Centre | date=March 2005 | accessdate=May 15, 2016 |author1=David Lyon |author2=Stephen Marmura |author3=Pasha Peroff }}&lt;/ref&gt; people, the storage of this data, and the governmental use of surveillance   to track suspicious types of people are significant issues&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.sscqueens.org/ | accessdate=May 15, 2016 |title=Surveillance Studies Centre }}&lt;/ref&gt; in privacy/[[surveillance]] and TSS.&lt;ref name="Lupp 1-25"/&gt; The availability of related technologies (e.g. [[EyeTap]], [[Memoto]]) to individuals (as opposed to governments or commercial interests) has also led to the phenomenon dubbed [[sousveillance]], whereby individuals track or record authorities' activities either online or in real environments.

Leading scholars in the study of surveillance include [[David Lyon (sociologist)|David Lyon]] and Mark Andrejevic.  In addition to contributing to the advent of [[citizen journalism]], the proliferation of sousveillance technologies has suggested a number of legal/regulatory, ethical, and social implications for democratic and consumer rights. A dramatic illustration of these concerns comes from University of Toronto Professor [[Steve Mann]], a privacy rights advocate and pioneering engineer of such technologies. After being allegedly assaulted&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://wearcam.org/mcdonalds/eyetap_blogspot_mcdonalds.pdf | title=Physical assault by McDonald's for wearing Digital Eye Glass | work=wearcam.org | date=July 16, 2012 | accessdate=May 15, 2016 | first=Steve | last=Mann | archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6DGSr4dBe?url=http://wearcam.org/mcdonalds/eyetap_blogspot_mcdonalds.pdf | archivedate=2012-12-29 | deadurl=yes | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; in a French McDonald's restaurant for wearing an augmented-reality digital eye glass device, Mann was, ironically, allegedly denied access&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://wearcam.org/mcdonalds/Unanswered_letter_to_McDonalds_Head_of_Customer_Services.pdf | title=Unanswered letter to McDonalds' Head of Customer Services | work=wearcam.org | date=August 17, 2012 | accessdate=May 15, 2016 | first=Steve | last=Mann | archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6DGXfTquv?url=http://wearcam.org/mcdonalds/Unanswered_letter_to_McDonalds_Head_of_Customer_Services.pdf | archivedate=2012-12-29 | deadurl=no | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; to McDonald's own surveillance camera footage.

===Human enhancement technology===

[[Human enhancement]] technology (HET) is the study of tools that would better and improve a human being's way of life.&lt;ref name=LuppiciniP15&gt;Luppicini, p. 15&lt;/ref&gt; It seeks to advance and progress what humans already do within their normal lives. However, customarily it seeks to aid any illnesses and weaknesses in the body.  Popular topics within this new area of study include, [[sex reassignment surgery]], mood enhancers, [[genomics]], and [[neuroenhancement]].&lt;ref name=LuppiciniP15/&gt; Enhancement within the workplace is a new topic of discussion, while the workplace should be adapting to the various types of human impairment, it seems that improving the workers is of more concern to corporations.&lt;ref&gt;Human enhancement. (2012). ''Psychologist'', 25(12), 875-875.&lt;/ref&gt; Through the use of [[cyborg]] prosthetics one can assemble themselves in their own vision, any disfigurement or handicap can possibly disappear.&lt;ref name="Hogle, L. F. 2005"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hogle | first1 = L. F. | year = 2005 | title = Enhancement technologies and the body | url = | journal = Annual Review of Anthropology | volume = 34 | issue = 1| pages = 695–716 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.anthro.33.070203.144020 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Within the evolution of cyborg prosthetics a human is able to physically grasp things more easily, allowing more of the population to engage in whatever they choose.  A large aspect of this technology stems from the ability to determine who may and may not benefit, as well as how  access to these new technologies should be controlled.

Human bodies can now not only be improved upon through natural means, but through the effects of technology.&lt;ref name="Hogle, L. F. 2005"/&gt; This new form of enhancement is connected with what humans perceive of themselves, and as to how their own identity is created.  A human operates based on their abilities; these capabilities are the factors and characteristics that create a personality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = DeGrazia | first1 = D | year = 2005 | title = Enhancement technologies and human identity 1 | url = | journal = Journal of Medicine &amp; Philosophy | volume = 30 | issue = 3| pages = 261–283 | doi = 10.1080/03605310590960166 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The augmentation of these aptitudes leads to a new human, who has a renewed sense of who they are. The term 'free to be me' is closely related to this new form of enhancement, wherein technological enhancements can be either cosmetic or reconstructive.&lt;ref name="Hogle, L. F. 2005"/&gt;  Through the incorporation of medicine and technology "...[[cosmetic surgery]] then becomes a technology through which the body is normalized and homogenized as much as enhanced".&lt;ref name="Hogle, L. F. 2005"/&gt; A proper example relating to human enhancement and cyborgs could be the recently convicted [[Oscar Pistorius]]. In past years, [[Pistorius]] fought with the International Olympic Committee to have a place in the hurdles events of the 2012 Olympics in London. The controversy surrounding Pistorius extended to his artificial legs, and how they compared to the natural human anatomy; did Pistorius have an unfair advantage over his competitors? The ruling was left up to a scientific analysis of his legs and running stride which ultimately lead to his participation in the Olympic Games. Therefore, we've come to a time where decisions, and thus human panels, need to determine what is human, what is natural, and what is artificial.

Rights and privacy issues over human enhancement technology has given rise to challenging topics within technoself studies.&lt;ref name="Lupp 1-25"/&gt; For example, the consideration of ethical policies and guidelines in the deployment of HET is an emerging topic within TSS.&lt;ref name="Lupp 1-25"/&gt; Further, the question of access to HET, and where we draw the line between necessary therapeutic technologies, and frivolous human enhancement are being raised in TSS.&lt;ref name="Lupp 1-25"/&gt; Therefore, the emerging topic regarding the rights and privacy over HET is of great interest within TSS. Popular HET's topics in recent research academia include: Sex (re assignment) (Diamond &amp; Sigmundson, 1997; Zucker, 2002), mood enhancers (Rabin, 2006), cognitive enhancers (Walker, 2008), genomics (Zwart, 2009), and [[neuroenhancement]] (Northoff,1996). A second line of inquiry explores social, legal, and ethical aspects of human enhancement and possible threats to human dignity that could arise from the implementation of human enhancements
(Bostrom, 2005).

Some critiques engage a discussion between the development of HET and the socio-economic environment. [[Francis Fukuyama]], an American political scientist concerns about the future of HET might cause the extension of contradiction between the rich and poor within comparatively rich, industrialized nations because HET is likely to be a luxury product.&lt;ref&gt;Society for Computers &amp; Law. (n.d.). Retrieved November 5, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; At the moment, HET seems to be hard to be mainstream in public health services due to the price, which creates a deeper distinctions among those who can afford the technology and those who will remain disabled.

===Transhumanism===

[[Transhuman]] thought focuses on beliefs held that the fundamental transformation of the human condition will be through the development of various technology, which will eventually eliminate human aging and will enhance human capacities, both physical and mental.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Moravec, Hans|year=1998|title=When will computer hardware match the human brain?|journal=Journal of Evolution and Technology|volume=1|accessdate=2006-06-23|url=http://www.ee.sc.edu/classes/Fall11/elct762/Class_Notes/Moravec.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Believers in this theory think that the future of human development will see a new intelligent species that will be enhanced by the technological advances. They use these technological advances to approach various issues regarding the human experience, like morality and health issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Moreno, Jonathan D.|year=2006|title=Mind Wars: Brain Research and National Defense|publisher=Dana Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; They see this convergence happening through the support of current technologies and the vision of technology in the future; using these advances to eventually make humans more than human, enhanced through this technology. Their central argument is that humans need to be able to choose whether or not this technology is used by them or not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Clark, Amanda C. R.|date=March 12, 2010|title=Transhumanism and Posthumanism: Lifting Man Up or Pulling Him Down?|website=Ignatius Insight|accessdate=2012-05-18|url=http://www.ignatiusinsight.com/features2010/aclark_tranhumanism_mar2010.asp}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This theory expands on the notion of technoself, as [[transhumanism]] poses what to many who hold these beliefs is the natural evolution of the human condition. Many look to the history of technological advancements as proof that these future advancements are possible, at least in theory.

===Real and virtual identities===

[[Avatar (computing)|Avatar]]s are a visual representation of a user in an online environment. This representation may be an accurate physical representation of the user, or may be completely different. This online representation may affect the offline self. Pena and his colleagues explored a phenomenon known as the "[[Proteus effect]]" wherein "avatars can prime negative attitudes and cognition in desktop virtual settings".&lt;ref name="Pena et al"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Peña | first1 = J. | last2 = Hancock | first2 = J. | last3 = Merola | first3 = N. | year = 2009 | title = The priming effects of avatars in virtual settings | url = | journal = Communication Research | volume = 36 | issue = 6| pages = 838–856 | doi = 10.1177/0093650209346802 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They conducted a study that demonstrated how the appearance and affiliations of an individual's online avatar can alter the individual's offscreen personality and attitudes. Pena's group used virtual group discussions to gauge the aggressiveness of individuals using avatars wearing black cloaks versus their control group counterparts wearing white and found more aggressive intentions and attitudes in the black cloak group.

Similar results were found in a second study that used Thematic Apperception Test studies to determine the differences between values and attitudes of a control group and a group using a [[Ku Klux Klan|Ku Klux Klan (KKK)]]-associated avatar. Individuals using the KKK-associated avatars were less affiliative and displayed more negative thoughts than the control group. Further support for Pena et al.'s work can be found in other studies that yielded similar results: "Yee and Bailenson found that, in an immersive 3D environment, participants using avatars with more attractive faces walked closer and disclosed more information when compared to those using avatars with less attractive faces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Yee | first1 = N. | last2 = Bailenson | first2 = J. | last3 = Ducheneaut | first3 = N. | year = 2009 | title = The proteus effect | url = | journal = Communication Research | volume = 36 | issue = 2| pages = 285–312 | doi = 10.1177/0093650208330254 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition...participants using taller avatars tended to negotiate more forcefully in comparison to those using shorter avatars."&lt;ref name="Pena et al" /&gt; A growing body of evidence supports how our online personas can affect our offline self; altering our attitudes and values.

===Online anonymity and presentation of the self===

[[Anonymous post|Online anonymity]] is commonly described using the phrase "[[On the Internet, nobody knows you're a dog]]". Online anonymity allows users to present different versions of themselves in online environments. Unconstrained by physical limitations, users are free to choose and construct their virtual form(s) and identities. Virtual spaces which foster such freedom and anonymity therefore allow  users to depart from the expectations, norms, and behaviours of their daily lives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hardey | first1 = M | year = 2002 | title = Life Beyond the Screen: embodiment and identity through the internet | journal = The Editorial Board of Sociological Review | volume = 50 | issue = | pages = 570–585 |doi=10.1111/1467-954X.00399|url=http://www.jimelwood.net/students/grips/man_group_comm/hardey_2000.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can be said that this unlimited freedom of anonymous expression allows for the transfer of real world suppressed emotions to the online domain. However, if one continually chooses to express their true self anonymously online as opposed to in the real world via face to face interaction, which realm would be more 'real'? As extreme as this scenario may seem, one could say the suppression of norms and natural expression would deem the physical self the avatar, and the online avatar the true self.

A user's [[online identity]] is a social identity that represents the user in the online environment, allowing a user a high level of control over their identity in a way that differs from the offline world. Turkle found that the level of control over creating an online identity also extends to the intensity of connections made in such virtual spaces, as users may engage and disengage at will.&lt;ref name=Turkle&gt;{{cite book|last1=Turkle|first1=Sherry|title=Alone Together: why we expect more from technology and less from each other|date=2011|publisher=Basic Books|location=New York|isbn=9780465031467}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dervin and Abbas note that Turkle, in her early work was "one of the first to show how anonymity 'provides ample room for individuals to express unexplored parts of themselves' more easily than in face-to-face interaction".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Abbas|first1=Y.|last2=Dervin|first2=F.|year=2009|title=Digital Technologies of the Self|contribution=Introduction|url=http://www.c-s-p.org/flyers/978-1-4438-1419-5-sample.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130806074020/http://www.c-s-p.org/flyers/978-1-4438-1419-5-sample.pdf|archivedate=August 6, 2013|deadurl=yes|location=Newcastle|publisher=Cambridge Scholars Publishing}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Within this notion of being free in online anonymity, technoself studies also looks at what the element of hiding does to us.  Turkle suggests that, "our networked life allows us to hide from each other, even as we are tethered to each other".&lt;ref name=Turkle/&gt; Technoself studies explores what these profiles do to the human unconscious.  While people are "exposing" themselves, they question their level of exposure and sharing compared to extent in what they are truly hiding in reality.
Furthermore, when creating online profiles, people risk others' perceptions of the information shared and if they receive the messages that the sender intended. Without verbal communication misperceptions, messages can alter identity or personal development.

Avatars can be an important element of the online presentation of the user. In many cases, "avatars in blogging were created to accurately reflect their owners' physical appearance, lifestyle and preferences. By contrast, participants in the dating and gaming treatments accentuated certain aspects of their avatar to reflect the tone and perceived expectations of the context".&lt;ref name="Vasalou &amp; Joinson"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Vasalou | first1 = A. | last2 = Joinson | first2 = A. N. | year = 2009 | title = Me, myself and I: The role of interactional context on self-presentation through avatars | url = | journal = Computers in Human Behavior | volume = 25 | issue = 2| pages = 510–520 | doi = 10.1016/j.chb.2008.11.007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, individuals often emphasize or downplay certain characteristics depending upon the context of their online interactions. These inconsistencies tend to be trivial, however. For instance, men tend to mildly exaggerate their height, while women often underestimate their weight. This is typically not an attempt to mislead others but to be as honest as possible while still presenting themselves in the best light.

According to Vasalou &amp; Joinson, although various online forums may present people with the opportunity to create (an) alternate persona(s), they typically choose to create an avatar or represent themselves in a way that is consistent with reality: "In having equal access to everyday artifacts and fantasy options, participants were inclined to draw on existing self-views rather than grasping the opportunity to explore other personas". Furthermore, Vasalou and Joinson also claim that, in the context of online communication, high self-awareness (as demonstrated by an avatar largely consistent with an individual's offline persona), contributes to a higher rate of interpersonal communication.&lt;ref name="Vasalou &amp; Joinson" /&gt;

One consequence of online anonymity and creating false identities is the ability to "catfish". [[Catfishing]] is a recent internet phenomenon, of manipulating, deceiving and luring people into relationships, through creating an online fictional persona. In many cases these deceptions are used to create romantic or intimate affairs. Since the affair happens entirely through technology, one is able to hide their true identity and carry on the relationship through their made up character. The majority of these incidences happen through social media sites, such as [[Facebook]], and internet dating sites where people are already looking for love, and therefore can be easily manipulated by peoples personas and deceptions.

==New directions and opportunities in research==

===Personalized robots and social integration of artificial creatures===
{{See also|Ubiquitous robot|Cloud robotics|Domestic robot}}
New directions and opportunities in technoself research involving personalized robots and social integration of artificial creatures is becoming an increasing reality. Considering the work of pioneering computer scientists and robotics experts such a Rodney Brooks and Hiroshi Ishiguro, human interaction with personal and social robots reached mainstream audiences beginning with the popularization of robotic dolls and pets for children.&lt;ref name=LuppP17&gt;Luppicini, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt;  Research by [[Sherry Turkle]] examines many of the effects of these social robots on children, middle and elderly. There are also robots for adults aimed at therapeutic (technotherapy), personal, and social applications ([[Paro (robot)|Paro]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cute Baby Seal Robot - PARO Theraputic Robot #DigInfo|date= August 11, 2010|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJq5PQZHU-I&amp;feature=related}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Phobot]], [[Roxxxy]], etc.).&lt;ref name=LuppP17/&gt; These types of therapeutic robots are used in nursing homes and hospitals, with the purpose of creating an environment where one can nurture and communicate with an animal. This allows people in a lonely or isolated environment the ability to have something to care for and interact with that is also able to respond and interact back. This has shown to provide happiness and a larger sense of purpose for the individuals, even if for a short period of time.  With personalized robots and the social integration of artificial intelligence, technoself is developing in children through relationships with robotic pets and related robotic technologies based on animals, objects, or people ([[Tamagotchi]], [[Furby]], [[AIBO]], etc.).&lt;ref name=LuppP17/&gt;  Current areas of interest in this topic are reported in [[Melson]] (2012), which provide helpful insights into children's views about robot pets, children's relationship with robotic pets and, conceptualizations of self-identity within child-robot relationships.&lt;ref name=LuppP17/&gt; Other research is focusing more on personalized robots for adults.

These relationships have important implications for the future of healthcare as interactive technology increasingly replaces roles traditionally filled by humans.

===Human enhancement regulation and governance===
{{See also|:Category:Regulation of technologies}}
Human enhancement regulation, governance, and legal concerns has become another growing concern for the opportunity of TSS research. According to Saner and Geelen (2012), there is one framework to guide technoself governance which distinguishes six different approaches to which emerging technologies may affect human identity:
# physical alteration of existing human beings
# changes to how existing human bodies are perceived
# the creation of novel humanoid bodies
# physical alteration of existing human environments
# changes to the way humans perceive existing human environments
# creation of novel human environments.&lt;ref name=LuppP17/&gt;

Luppicini posits that this sort of model could "prove invaluable for guiding future decision making directed at the framing of HET regulation debates, as well as leveraging strategic planning and decision making concerning HET adaption standards."&lt;ref name=LuppP17/&gt; [[Technoethics]] relates to the ethical considerations concerning technology in society.Human enhancement improves aspects of human function and may temporarily or permanently overcome the limitations of the human body through natural or artificial means. The consequences of such technological alterations implies ethical questions such as the unfair physical and mental categorization of certain individuals. Therefore, further consideration will need to be associated with ethical questions surrounding the evolution of technology. With growing trends of artificial intelligence and technological devices, such as [[Google Glass]], stricter regulation will be necessary. Furthermore, [[Elon Musk]] recently stated that "We need to be careful with AI (artificial intelligence). Potentially more dangerous than nukes",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/elon-musk-artificial-intelligence-may-be-more-dangerous-than-nukes/|title=Elon Musk: Artificial intelligence may be "more dangerous than nukes"|date=August 4, 2014|work=CBS News|first=Eliene|last=Augenbraun}}&lt;/ref&gt; meaning that there may be need to worry about the evolution of technology, and specifically how humans employ it to their benefit.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9108">In [[differential geometry]], the '''Weyl curvature tensor''', named after [[Hermann Weyl]], is a measure of the [[curvature]] of [[spacetime]] or, more generally, a [[pseudo-Riemannian manifold]].  Like the [[Riemann curvature tensor]], the Weyl tensor expresses the [[tidal force]] that a body feels when moving along a [[geodesic]].  The Weyl tensor differs from the Riemann curvature tensor in that it does not convey information on how the volume of the body changes, but rather only how the shape of the body is distorted by the tidal force.  The [[Ricci curvature]], or [[trace (linear algebra)|trace]] component of the Riemann tensor contains precisely the information about how volumes change in the presence of tidal forces, so the Weyl tensor is the [[traceless]] component of the Riemann tensor. It is a [[tensor]] that has the same symmetries as the Riemann tensor with the extra condition that it be trace-free: [[Tensor contraction#Metric contraction|metric contraction]] on any pair of indices yields zero.

In [[general relativity]], the Weyl curvature is the only part of the curvature that exists in free space&amp;mdash;a solution of the [[Einstein field equation|vacuum Einstein equation]]&amp;mdash;and it governs the propagation of [[gravitational waves]] through regions of space devoid of matter.&lt;ref name="Danehkar2009"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Danehkar | first1=A. | date=2009 | title=On the Significance of the Weyl Curvature in a Relativistic Cosmological Model | journal=Mod. Phys. Lett. A | volume=24 | issue=38 | pages=3113–3127 | doi=10.1142/S0217732309032046 | bibcode=2009MPLA...24.3113D| arxiv=0707.2987 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  More generally, the Weyl curvature is the only component of curvature for [[Ricci-flat manifold]]s and always governs the [[method of characteristics|characteristics]] of the field equations of an [[Einstein manifold]].&lt;ref name="Danehkar2009"/&gt;

In dimensions 2 and 3 the Weyl curvature tensor vanishes identically. In dimensions ≥ 4, the Weyl curvature is generally nonzero. If the Weyl tensor vanishes in dimension ≥ 4, then the metric is locally [[conformally flat]]: there exists a [[local coordinate system]] in which the metric tensor is proportional to a constant tensor.  This fact was a key component of [[Nordström's theory of gravitation]], which was a precursor of [[general relativity]].

==Definition==
The Weyl tensor can be obtained from the full curvature tensor by subtracting out various traces. This is most easily done by writing the Riemann tensor as a (0,4) valence tensor (by contracting with the metric). The (0,4) valence Weyl tensor is then {{Harv|Petersen|2006|p=92}}
&lt;math&gt;C = R - \frac{1}{n-2}\left(\mathrm{Ric} - \frac{s}{n}g\right) \wedge\!\!\!\!\!\!\bigcirc g - \frac{s}{2n(n-1)}g \wedge\!\!\!\!\!\!\bigcirc g&lt;/math&gt;
where ''n'' is the dimension of the manifold, ''g'' is the metric, ''R'' is the Riemann tensor, ''Ric'' is the [[Ricci tensor]], ''s'' is the [[scalar curvature]], and &lt;math&gt;h \wedge\!\!\!\!\!\!\bigcirc k&lt;/math&gt; denotes the [[Kulkarni–Nomizu product]] of two symmetric (0,2) tensors:
{| style="margin-left: 2em;"
|-
|&lt;math&gt;(h \wedge\!\!\!\!\!\!\bigcirc k)(v_1,v_2,v_3,v_4) = &lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;h(v_1,v_3)k(v_2,v_4)+h(v_2,v_4)k(v_1,v_3)\,&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;{}-h(v_1,v_4)k(v_2,v_3)-h(v_2,v_3)k(v_1,v_4)\,&lt;/math&gt;
|}
In full tensor notation, this can be written as 
&lt;math&gt;C_{ik\ell m}=R_{ik\ell m} + \frac{1}{n-2}\left(R_{im}g_{k\ell}  - R_{i\ell}g_{km} + R_{k\ell}g_{im} - R_{km}g_{i\ell} \right)
+ \frac{1}{(n-1)(n-2)} R \left(g_{i\ell}g_{km} - g_{im}g_{k\ell} \right).\ &lt;/math&gt;

The ordinary (1,3) valent Weyl tensor is then given by contracting the above with the inverse of the metric.

The decomposition ({{EquationNote|1}}) expresses the Riemann tensor as an [[orthogonal]] [[direct sum of vector bundles|direct sum]], in the sense that
:&lt;math&gt;|R|^2 = |C|^2 + \left|\frac{1}{n-2}\left(\mathrm{Ric} - \frac{s}{n}g\right) \wedge\!\!\!\!\!\!\bigcirc g\right|^2 + \left|\frac{s}{2n(n-1)}g \wedge\!\!\!\!\!\!\bigcirc g\right|^2.&lt;/math&gt;
This decomposition, known as the [[Ricci decomposition]], expresses the Riemann curvature tensor into its [[irreducible representation|irreducible]] components under the action of the [[orthogonal group]] {{Harv|Singer|Thorpe|1968}}.  In dimension 4, the Weyl tensor further decomposes into invariant factors for the action of the [[special orthogonal group]], the self-dual and antiself-dual parts ''C''&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and ''C''&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;.

The Weyl tensor can also be expressed using the [[Schouten tensor]], which is a trace-adjusted multiple of the Ricci tensor,
:&lt;math&gt;P = \frac{1}{n-2}\left(\mathrm{Ric} - \frac{s}{2(n-1)}g\right).&lt;/math&gt;
Then
:&lt;math&gt;C = R - P \wedge\!\!\!\!\!\!\bigcirc g.&lt;/math&gt;

In indices,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Grøn|Hervik|2007|loc=p. 490}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;C_{abcd}=R_{abcd}-\frac{2}{n-2}(g_{a[c}R_{d]b}-g_{b[c}R_{d]a})+\frac{2}{(n-1)(n-2)}R~g_{a[c}g_{d]b}&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;R_{abcd}&lt;/math&gt; is the Riemann tensor, &lt;math&gt;R_{ab}&lt;/math&gt; is the Ricci tensor, &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is the Ricci scalar (the scalar curvature) and brackets around indices refers to the [[Antisymmetric tensor|antisymmetric part]].  Equivalently,
:&lt;math&gt;{C_{ab}}^{cd} = {R_{ab}}^{cd} - 4S_{[a}^{[c}\delta_{b]}^{d]}&lt;/math&gt;
where ''S'' denotes the [[Schouten tensor]].

==Properties==

===Conformal rescaling===
The Weyl tensor has the special property that it is invariant under [[conformal map|conformal]] changes to the [[metric tensor|metric]]. That is, if ''g''′ = ''f g'' for some positive scalar function ''f'' then the (1,3) valent Weyl tensor satisfies ''C''′ = ''C''. For this reason the Weyl tensor is also called the '''conformal tensor'''. It follows that a [[necessary condition]] for a Riemannian manifold to be [[conformally flat]] is that the Weyl tensor vanish. In dimensions ≥ 4 this condition is [[sufficient condition|sufficient]] as well. In dimension 3 the vanishing of the [[Cotton tensor]] is a necessary and sufficient condition for the Riemannian manifold being conformally flat.  Any 2-dimensional (smooth) Riemannian manifold is conformally flat, a consequence of the existence of [[isothermal coordinates]].

Indeed, the existence of a conformally flat scale amounts to solving the overdetermined partial differential equation
:&lt;math&gt;Ddf - df\otimes df +\left(|df|^2 + \frac{\Delta f}{n-2}\right)g = \operatorname{Ric}.&lt;/math&gt;
In dimension ≥ 4, the vanishing of the Weyl tensor is the only [[integrability condition]] for this equation; in dimension 3, it is the [[Cotton tensor]] instead.

===Symmetries===
The Weyl tensor has the same symmetries as the Riemann tensor.  This includes:
:&lt;math&gt;C(u,v)=-C(v,u)^{}_{}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\langle C(u,v)w,z \rangle=-\langle C(u,v)z,w \rangle^{}_{}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;C(u,v)w+C(v,w)u+C(w,u)v=0 ^{}_{}.&lt;/math&gt;
In addition, of course, the Weyl tensor is trace free:
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{tr} C(u,\cdot)v = 0&lt;/math&gt;
for all ''u'', ''v''.  In indices these four conditions are
:&lt;math&gt;C_{abcd}^{}=-C_{bacd}=-C_{abdc}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;C_{abcd}+C_{acdb}+C_{adbc}^{}=0&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;{C^a}_{bac} = 0.&lt;/math&gt;

===Bianchi identity===
Taking traces of the usual second Bianchi identity of the Riemann tensor eventually shows that
:&lt;math&gt;\nabla_a {C^a}_{bcd} = 2(n-3)\nabla_{[c}S_{d]b}&lt;/math&gt;
where ''S'' is the [[Schouten tensor]].  The valence (0,3) tensor on the right-hand side is the [[Cotton tensor]], apart from the initial factor.

[[Image:XOR Swap.svg|thumb|upright=2|alt=With three XOR operations the binary values 1010 and 0011 are exchanged between variables.|Using the XOR swap algorithm to exchange [[nibble]]s between variables without the use of temporary storage]]

In [[computer programming]], the '''XOR swap''' is an [[algorithm]] that uses the [[exclusive disjunction|XOR]] [[bitwise operation]] to [[swap (computer science)|swap]] values of distinct [[variable (programming)|variable]]s having the same [[data type]] without using a temporary variable. "Distinct" means that the variables are stored at different, non-overlapping, memory addresses; the actual values of the variables do not have to be different.

==The algorithm==
Conventional swapping requires the use of a temporary storage variable. Using the XOR swap algorithm, however, no temporary storage is needed. The algorithm is as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cs.umd.edu/class/sum2003/cmsc311/Notes/BitOp/xor.html |title=The Magic of XOR |publisher=Cs.umd.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://graphics.stanford.edu/~seander/bithacks.html#SwappingValuesXOR|title=Swapping Values with XOR|publisher=graphics.stanford.edu|accessdate=2014-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="pascal"&gt;
X := X XOR Y
Y := Y XOR X
X := X XOR Y
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

The algorithm typically corresponds to three [[machine code|machine-code]] instructions. Since XOR is a [[commutative operation]], X XOR Y can be replaced with Y XOR X in any of the lines. When coded in assembly language, this commutativity is often exercised in the second line:

{| class="wikitable" style="width: 45em;"
|-
! Pseudocode !! IBM [[System/370]] assembly !! x86 assembly
|-
| {{code|1=X := X XOR Y|2=pascal}} || {{code|1=XR    R1,R2|2=asm}} || {{code|1=xor    eax, ebx|2=asm}}
|-
| {{code|1=Y := Y XOR X|2=pascal}} || {{code|1=XR    R2,R1|2=asm}} || {{code|1=xor    ebx, eax|2=asm}}
|-
| {{code|1=X := X XOR Y|2=pascal}} || {{code|1=XR    R1,R2|2=asm}} || {{code|1=xor    eax, ebx|2=asm}}
|}

In the above System/370 assembly code sample, R1 and R2 are distinct [[processor register|register]]s, and each XR operation leaves its result in the register named in the first argument. Using x86 assembly, values X and Y are in registers eax and ebx (respectively), and {{code|xor|2=asm}} places the result of the operation in the first register.

However, the algorithm fails if ''x'' and ''y'' use the same storage location, since the value stored in that location will be zeroed out by the first XOR instruction, and then remain zero; it will not be "swapped with itself". Note that this is ''not'' the same as if ''x'' and ''y'' have the same values.  The trouble only comes when ''x'' and ''y'' use the same storage location, in which case their values must already be equal. That is, if ''x'' and ''y'' use the same storage location, then the line:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="pascal"&gt;
X := X XOR Y
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
sets ''x'' to zero (because ''x'' = ''y'' so X XOR Y is zero) ''and'' sets ''y'' to zero (since it uses the same storage location), causing ''x'' and ''y'' to lose their original values.

==Proof of correctness==
The [[binary operation]] XOR over bit strings of length &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; exhibits the following properties (where &lt;math&gt;\oplus&lt;/math&gt; denotes XOR):{{Efn|The first three properties, along with the existence of an inverse for each element, are the definition of an [[abelian group]]. The last property is the statement that every element is an [[Involution (mathematics)|involution]], that is, having [[Order (group theory)|order]] 2, which is not true of all abelian groups.}}

* '''L1.''' [[Commutative operation|Commutativity]]: &lt;math&gt;A \oplus B = B \oplus A&lt;/math&gt;
* '''L2.''' [[Associativity]]: &lt;math&gt;(A \oplus B) \oplus C = A \oplus (B \oplus C)&lt;/math&gt;
* '''L3.''' [[Identity element|Identity exists]]: there is a bit string, 0, (of length ''N'') such that &lt;math&gt;A \oplus 0 = A&lt;/math&gt; for any &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;
* '''L4.''' Each element is its own [[inverse element|inverse]]: for each &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;A \oplus A = 0&lt;/math&gt;.

Suppose that we have two distinct registers &lt;code&gt;R1&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;R2&lt;/code&gt; as in the table below, with initial values ''A'' and ''B'' respectively. We perform the operations below in sequence, and reduce our results using the properties listed above.

=== Linear algebra interpretation ===
As XOR can be interpreted as binary addition and a pair of values can be interpreted as a point in two-dimensional space, the steps in the algorithm can be interpreted as 2&amp;times;2 matrices with binary values. For simplicity, assume initially that ''x'' and ''y'' are each single bits, not bit vectors.

For example, the step:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="pascal"&gt;
X := X XOR Y
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
which also has the implicit:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="pascal"&gt;
Y := Y
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
corresponds to the matrix &lt;math&gt;\left(\begin{smallmatrix}1 &amp; 1\\0 &amp; 1\end{smallmatrix}\right)&lt;/math&gt; as
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix}1 &amp; 1\\0 &amp; 1\end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix}x\\y\end{pmatrix}
= \begin{pmatrix}x+y\\y\end{pmatrix}.
&lt;/math&gt;
The sequence of operations is then expressed as:
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{pmatrix}1 &amp; 1\\0 &amp; 1\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}1 &amp; 0\\1 &amp; 1\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}1 &amp; 1\\0 &amp; 1\end{pmatrix}
=
\begin{pmatrix}0 &amp; 1\\1 &amp; 0\end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;
(working with binary values, so &lt;math&gt;1 + 1 = 0&lt;/math&gt;), which expresses the [[elementary matrix]] of switching two rows (or columns) in terms of the [[Shear mapping|transvections]] (shears) of adding one element to the other.

To generalize to where X and Y are not single bits, but instead bit vectors of length ''n'', these 2&amp;times;2 matrices are replaced by 2''n''&amp;times;2''n'' [[block matrices]] such as &lt;math&gt;\left(\begin{smallmatrix}I_n &amp; I_n\\0 &amp; I_n\end{smallmatrix}\right).&lt;/math&gt;

Note that these matrices are operating on ''values,'' not on ''variables'' (with storage locations), hence this interpretation abstracts away from issues of storage location and the problem of both variables sharing the same storage location.

==Code example==
A [[C (programming language)|C]] function that implements the XOR swap algorithm:
&lt;!-- This display template is broken in IE 6, the top half of the pretty bordered box is cut off. --&gt;
&lt;source lang="c"&gt;
 void xorSwap (int *x, int *y) {
     if (x != y) {
         *x ^= *y;
         *y ^= *x;
         *x ^= *y;
     }
 }
&lt;/source&gt;
Note that the code does not swap the integers passed immediately, but first checks if their addresses are distinct. This is because, if the addresses are equal, the algorithm will fold to a triple *x ^= *x resulting in zero.

The code below is an example of overly-concise C code; the behavior of the code is undefined. (Writing overly-concise C code has become unnecessary as modern optimizing compilers will eliminate intermediate results and temporary variables.)
&lt;source lang="c"&gt;
 /* kcc: "Undefined behavior - Error: EIO8
    Description: unsequenced side effect on scalar object with value computation of same object."
    See: https://github.com/kframework/c-semantics and https://runtimeverification.com/match/1.0-SNAPSHOT/docs/runningexamples/
    There are no sequence points to force the execution of (*y=*x) last - see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequence_point
 */
 void xorSwap (int *x, int *y) {
     *x ^= *y ^= ( *y ^= *x );
 }
&lt;/source&gt;

The XOR swap algorithm can also be defined with a macro:
&lt;source lang="c"&gt;
#define XORSWAP_UNSAFE(a, b)	((a)^=(b),(b)^=(a),(a)^=(b)) /* Doesn't work when a and b are the same object - assigns zero (0) to the object in that case */
#define XORSWAP(a, b)   ((&amp;(a) == &amp;(b)) ? (a) : ((a)^=(b),(b)^=(a),(a)^=(b))) /* checks that the addresses of a and b are different before XOR-ing */
&lt;/source&gt;

==Reasons for use in practice==
In most practical scenarios, the trivial swap algorithm using a temporary register is more efficient. Limited situations in which XOR swapping may be practical include:

* on a processor where the instruction set encoding permits the XOR swap to be encoded in a smaller number of bytes
* in a region with high [[register pressure]], it may allow the [[register allocator]] to avoid [[spilling a register]]
* in [[microcontrollers]] where available RAM is very limited.
* in cryptographic applications which need constant time functions to prevent time-based side-channel attacks&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Schneier|first1=Tadayoshi Kohno, Niels Ferguson, Bruce|title=Cryptography engineering : design principles and practical applications|date=2010|publisher=Wiley Pub., inc.|location=Indianapolis, IN|isbn=978-0-470-47424-2|page=251 ff.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because these situations are rare, most optimizing compilers do not generate XOR swap code.

==Reasons for avoidance in practice==
Most modern compilers can optimize away the temporary variable in the native swap, in which case the native swap uses the same amount of memory and the same number of registers as the XOR swap and is at least as fast, and often faster. The XOR swap is also much less readable and completely opaque to anyone unfamiliar with the technique.

On modern [[CPU architecture]]s, the XOR technique can be slower than using a temporary variable to do swapping. One reason is that modern CPUs strive to execute instructions in parallel via [[instruction pipeline]]s. In the XOR technique, the inputs to each operation depend on the results of the previous operation, so they must be executed in strictly sequential order, negating any benefits of [[instruction-level parallelism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first1=Saman |last1=Amarasinghe |first2=Charles |last2=Leiserson |title=6.172 Performance Engineering of Software Systems, Lecture 2 |year=2010 |publisher=Massachusetts Institute of Technology |website=MIT OpenCourseWare |url=http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-172-performance-engineering-of-software-systems-fall-2010/video-lectures/lecture-2-bit-hacks/ |accessdate=27 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A historical reason was that it used to be patented (US4197590).  Even then, this was only for computer graphics.

===Aliasing===
The XOR swap is also complicated in practice by [[aliasing (computing)|aliasing]]. As noted above, if an attempt is made to XOR-swap the contents of some location with itself, the result is that the location is zeroed out and its value lost. Therefore, XOR swapping must not be used blindly in a high-level language if aliasing is possible.

Similar problems occur with [[call by name]], as in [[Jensen's Device]], where swapping &lt;code&gt;i&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;A[i]&lt;/code&gt; via a temporary variable yields incorrect results due to the arguments being related: swapping via &lt;code&gt;temp = i; i = A[i]; A[i] = temp&lt;/code&gt; changes the value for &lt;code&gt;i&lt;/code&gt; in the second statement, which then results in the incorrect i value for &lt;code&gt;A[i]&lt;/code&gt; in the third statement.

==Variations==
The underlying principle of the XOR swap algorithm can be applied to any operation meeting criteria L1 through L4 above. Replacing XOR by addition and subtraction gives a slightly different, but largely equivalent, formulation:

&lt;source lang="c"&gt;
 void addSwap (unsigned int *x, unsigned int *y)
 {
     if (x != y) {
         *x = *x + *y;
         *y = *x - *y;
         *x = *x - *y;
     }
 }
&lt;/source&gt;

Unlike the XOR swap, this variation requires that the underlying processor or programming language uses a method such as [[modular arithmetic]] or [[bignum]]s to guarantee that the computation of &lt;code&gt;X + Y&lt;/code&gt; cannot cause an error due to [[integer overflow]]. Therefore, it is seen even more rarely in practice than the XOR swap.

Note, however, that the implementation of &lt;code&gt;addSwap&lt;/code&gt; above in the C programming language always works even in case of integer overflow, since, according to the C standard, addition and  subtraction of unsigned integers follow the rules of [[modular arithmetic]], i. e. are done in the [[cyclic group]] &lt;math&gt;\mathbb Z/2^s\mathbb Z&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; is the number of bits of &lt;code&gt;unsigned int&lt;/code&gt;. Indeed, the correctness of the algorithm follows from the fact that the formulas &lt;math&gt;(x + y) - y = x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(x + y) - ((x + y) - y) = y&lt;/math&gt; hold in any [[abelian group]]. This is actually a generalization of the proof for the XOR swap algorithm: XOR is both the addition and subtraction in the abelian group &lt;math&gt;(\mathbb Z/2\mathbb Z)^{s}&lt;/math&gt;.

Please note that the above doesn't hold when dealing with the &lt;code&gt;signed int&lt;/code&gt; type (the default for &lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt;). Signed integer overflow is an undefined behavior in C and thus modular arithmetic is not guaranteed by the standard (a standard-conforming compiler might optimize out such code, which leads to incorrect results).

'''Śūnyatā''' ({{lang-sa|[[wikt:शून्यता#Sanskrit|शून्यता]]|śūnyatā}}; {{lang-pi|suññatā}}) – pronounced ‘shoonyataa’, translated into English most often as ''emptiness''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Dale Mathers|author2=Melvin E. Miller|author3=Osamu Ando|title=Self and No-Self: Continuing the Dialogue Between Buddhism and Psychotherapy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WVpcAgAAQBAJ |year=2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-317-72386-8|page=81}}&lt;/ref&gt; and sometimes ''voidness''&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20140228062714/http://www.palikanon.com/english/wtb/s_t/sunna.htm Suñña] - Palikanon.com,&lt;/ref&gt; – is a [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] concept which has multiple meanings depending on its doctrinal context. It is either an ontological feature of reality, a meditation state, or a phenomenological analysis of experience.

In [[Theravada Buddhism]], suññatā often refers to the [[anatta|non-self]] (Pāli: ''anattā'', Sanskrit: ''anātman''){{refn|group=note|A common translation is "no-self", without a self, but the Pali canon uses ''anattā'' as a singular substantive, meaning "not-self".{{sfn|Bronkhorst|2009|p=124}}}} nature of the [[five aggregates]] of experience and the [[ayatana|six sense spheres]]. Suññatā is also often used to refer to a meditative state or experience.

In [[Mahayana]], ''Sunyata'' refers to the tenet that "all things are empty of intrinsic existence and nature (''[[svabhava]]''),"  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Paul Williams|title=Mahayana Buddhism: The Doctrinal Foundations|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GMN-AgAAQBAJ|year=2008|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-134-25056-1|pages=68–69}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Christopher W. Gowans|title=Buddhist Moral Philosophy: An Introduction |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yW4KBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT69 |year=2014| publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-317-65934-1 |pages=69–70 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but may also refer to the [[Buddha-nature]] teachings and primordial or empty awareness, as in [[Dzogchen]] and [[Rangtong-Shentong|Shentong]].

==Etymology==
"''Śūnyatā''" ([[Sanskrit]]) is usually translated as "devoidness," "emptiness," "hollow, hollowness," "voidness." It is the noun form of the adjective ''śūnya'' or ''śhūnya'', plus ''-tā'': 
* ''śūnya'' means "zero," "nothing," "empty" or "void"&lt;ref&gt;Monier-Williams, Sir Monier (2nd edn, 1899) [http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/cgi-bin/serveimg.pl?file=/scans/MWScan/MWScanjpg/mw1085-zuSkavraNa.jpg ''A Sanskrit-English Dictionary'']. Reprinted Motilal Banarsidass, Delhi 1986: p.1085.&lt;/ref&gt; and derives from the root ''śvi'', meaning "hollow"
* ''-tā'' means "-ness"

==Development of the concept==
The concept of Sunyata as "emptiness", states Sue Hamilton, is related to the concept of ''[[anatta]]'' in early Buddhism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Sue Hamilton|title=Early Buddhism: A New Approach : the I of the Beholder |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ji9EvkprnPsC |year=2000|publisher = Routledge|isbn=978-0-7007-1357-8|pages=21–27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over time, many different philosophical schools or tenet-systems (Sanskrit: ''siddhānta'')&lt;ref&gt;Klein, Anne C. (1991). ''Knowing Naming &amp; Negation a sourcebook on Tibetan, Sautrantika''. Snowlion publications, {{ISBN|0-937938-21-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; have developed within Buddhism in an effort to explain the exact philosophical meaning of emptiness.

After the Buddha, emptiness was further developed by the [[Abhidharma]] schools, [[Nagarjuna|Nāgārjuna]] and the [[Madhyamaka|Mādhyamaka]] school, an early Mahāyāna school. Emptiness ("positively" interpreted) is also an important element of the [[Tathagatagarbha|Buddha nature]] literature, which played a formative role in the evolution of subsequent Mahāyāna doctrine and practice.

===Pāli Nikāyas===
[[Image:Foam - big.jpg|thumb|right|A simile from the Pali scriptures (SN 22.95) compares [[Rūpa#Buddhism|form]] and [[Vedanā|feelings]] with foam and bubbles.]]
{{See also|Sati (Buddhism)}}

The Pali canon uses the term emptiness in three ways: "(1) as a meditative dwelling, (2) as an attribute of objects, and (3) as a type of awareness-release."&lt;ref name="accesstoinsight.org"&gt;[http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/mn/mn.122.than.html MN 122. See, e.g., Maha-suññata Sutta: The Greater Discourse on Emptiness translated from the Pali by Thanissaro Bhikkhu," Retrieved on 30 July 2013 from "Access to Insight" at www.accesstoinsight.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Suñña Sutta'',&lt;ref name="Bhikkhu_1997d_3585"&gt;{{harvnb|Bhikkhu|1997d}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  part of the [[Pali Canon|Pāli canon]], relates that the monk [[Ananda|Ānanda]], [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha's]] attendant asked, 
{{quote|It is said that the world is empty, the world is empty, lord. In what respect is it said that the world is empty?" The Buddha replied, "Insofar as it is empty of a self or of anything pertaining to a self: Thus it is said, Ānanda, that the world is empty.}}

According to [[Thanissaro Bhikku]]:
{{quote|Emptiness as a quality of [[Dharmas#Buddhist phenomenology|dharmas]], in the early canons, means simply that one cannot identify them as one's own self or having anything pertaining to one's own self ... Emptiness as a mental state, in the early canons, means a mode of perception in which one neither adds anything to nor takes anything away from what is present, noting simply, "There is this." This mode is achieved through a process of intense concentration, coupled with the insight that notes more and more subtle levels of the presence and absence of disturbance (see MN 121).&lt;ref&gt;Thanissaro Bhikku, The Buddhist Religions: An Historical Introduction, P 96.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

====Emptiness of dhammas====
According to [[Bhikkhu Analayo]], the Pāli discourses use the adjective suñña with a much higher frequency than the corresponding noun suññatā. This reflects an emphasis on qualifying phenomena as 'being empty' rather than on an abstract state of empty-'ness' in early Buddhism, states Analayo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Analayo|first=Bhikkhu|authorlink=Bhikkhu Analayo|title=Excursions into the Thought-World of the Pali Discourses|year=2012|publisher=[[Pariyatti]]|page=272|ISBN=9781928706984}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

====Meditative state====
Emptiness as a meditative state is said to be reached when "not attending to any themes, he [the bhikku] enters &amp; remains in internal emptiness" (MN 122). This meditative dwelling is developed through the "four formless states" of meditation or [[Arūpajhāna]]s and then through "themeless concentration of awareness."&lt;ref name="accesstoinsight.org"/&gt;

The Cūlasuññata-sutta (MN III 104) and the Mahāsuññata-sutta (MN III 109) outline how a monk can "dwell in emptiness" through a gradual step by step mental cultivation process, they both stress the importance of the impermanence of mental states and the absence of a self.

In the Kāmabhu Sutta S IV.293, it is explained that a [[bhikkhu]] can experience a [[Jhana in Theravada#Cessation of feelings and perceptions|trancelike contemplation]] in which perception and feeling cease. When he emerges from this state, he recounts three types of "contact" (''[[Sparśa|phasso]]''):
# "emptiness" (''suññato''),
# "signless" (''animitto''),
# "undirected" (''appa{{IAST|ṇ}}ihito'').&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/sn/sn41/sn41.006.than.html SN 41.6. See, e.g., Thanissaro Bhikkhu (trans.) (2004), "SN 41.6 Kamabhu Sutta: With Kamabhu (On the Cessation of Perception &amp; Feeling)," retrieved Feb 4 2009 from "Access to Insight" at www.accesstoinsight.org]&lt;/ref&gt;
The meaning of emptiness as contemplated here is explained at M I.297 and S IV.296-97 as the "emancipation of the mind by emptiness" (''suññatā cetovimutti'') being consequent upon the realization that "this world is empty of self or anything pertaining to self" (''suññam ida{{IAST|ṃ}} attena vā attaniyena vā'').&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/mn/mn.043.than.html MN 43 and SN 41.7.  See, e.g., respectively, Thanissaro Bhikkhu (trans.) (2006), "MN 43 Mahavedalla Sutta: The Greater Set of Questions-and-Answers," retrieved February 4, 2009 from "Access to Insight"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/sn/sn41/sn41.007.than.html Thanissaro Bhikkhu (trans.) (2004), "SN 41.7 Godatta Sutta: To Godatta (On Awareness-release)," retrieved February 4, 2009 from "Access to Insight"]&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "emptiness" (''suññatā'') is also used in two suttas in the ''Majjhima Nikāya'', in the context of a progression of mental states. The texts refer to each state's emptiness of the one below.&lt;ref&gt;MN 121 and MN 122. See, e.g., respectively, Thanissaro (1997a) and Thanissaro (1997b).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chinese Āgamas===
Some of the Sarvāstivādin Agama sutras (extant in Chinese) which have emptiness as a theme include Samyukta Agama 335 - ''Paramārtha-śunyatā-sūtra'' (Sutra on ultimate emptiness) and Samyukta Agama 297 - ''Mahā-śunyatā-dharma-paryāya'' (Greater discourse on emptiness). These sutras have no parallel Pali suttas.&lt;ref&gt;Shì hùifēng, “Dependent Origination = Emptiness”—Nāgārjuna’s Innovation? An Examination of the Early and Mainstream Sectarian Textual Sources, page 26&lt;/ref&gt; These sutras associate emptiness with [[dependent origination]], which shows that this relation of the two terms was already established in pre-[[Nagarjuna]] sources. The sutra on great emptiness states:
{{quote|"What is the Dharma Discourse on Great Emptiness? It is this— ‘When this exists, that exists; when this arises, that arises.’"&lt;ref&gt;Shì hùifēng, “Dependent Origination = Emptiness”—Nāgārjuna’s Innovation? An Examination of the Early and Mainstream Sectarian Textual Sources, page 28.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The phrase "when this exists..." is a common gloss on [[dependent origination]]. Sarvāstivādin Agamas also speak of a certain emptiness [[samadhi]] (''śūnyatāsamādhi'') as well as stating that all dharmas are "classified as conventional".&lt;ref&gt;Shì hùifēng, “Dependent Origination = Emptiness”—Nāgārjuna’s Innovation? An Examination of the Early and Mainstream Sectarian Textual Sources, page 22, 27.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mun-Keat Choong and [[Yin Shun]] have both published studies on the various uses of emptiness in the [[Early Buddhist Texts]] (Pali Canon and Chinese [[Āgama (Buddhism)|Agamas]]).&lt;ref&gt;Choong, Mun-Keat; The Notion of Emptiness in Early Buddhism, Motilal Banarsidass Publishe, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Yìn Shùn; An Investigation into Emptiness (Kōng zhī Tànjìu 空之探究) (1985)&lt;/ref&gt; Choong has also published a collection of translations of Agama sutras from the Chinese on the topic of emptiness.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.une.edu.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0006/76164/2ed-2010-Annotated-Trans-SA-sutras-Emptiness-and-the-Middle-Way2.pdf Choong; Annotated Translation of Sutras from the Chinese Samyuktagama relevant to the Early Buddhist Teachings on Emptiness and the Middle Way (2004; second edition, International Buddhist College, Thailand, 2010.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early Buddhist schools and Abhidharma==
Many of the [[early Buddhist schools]] featured sunyata as an important part of their teachings.

The [[Sarvastivadin]] school's Abhidharma texts like the Dharmaskandhapāda Śāstra, and the later Mahāvibhāṣa also take up the theme of emptiness vis a vis dependent origination as found in the Agamas.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Shì hùifēng, “Dependent Origination = Emptiness”—Nāgārjuna’s Innovation? An Examination of the Early and Mainstream Sectarian Textual Sources&lt;/ref&gt;

Schools such as the [[Mahāsāṃghika]] Prajñaptivādins as well as many of the Sthavira schools (except the [[Pudgalavada]]) held that all dharmas were empty (dharma śūnyatā).&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; This can be seen in the early [[Theravada]] [[Abhidhamma]] texts such as the [[Patisambhidamagga]] which also speak of the emptiness of the five aggregates and of [[svabhava]] as being "empty of essential nature".&lt;ref&gt;Potter, Karl H; Abhidharma Buddhism to 150 A.D., page 98&lt;/ref&gt; The Theravada [[Kathavatthu]] also argues against the idea that emptiness is unconditioned.&lt;ref&gt;Shì hùifēng, “Dependent Origination = Emptiness”—Nāgārjuna’s Innovation? An Examination of the Early and Mainstream Sectarian Textual Sources, page 36.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the main themes of Harivarman's [[Tattvasiddhi]]-Śāstra (3rd-4th century) is ''[[Dharma (Buddhism)|dharma]]-śūnyatā'', the emptiness of phenomena.&lt;ref&gt;Skilton, Andrew. ''A Concise History of Buddhism.'' 2004. pp. 91-92&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theravada==
[[Theravada]] Buddhists generally take the view espoused in the [[Pali canon]], that emptiness is merely the [[Anatta|not-self]] nature of the [[five aggregates]] as well as a mode of perception which is "empty of the presuppositions we usually add to experience to make sense of it"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/thanissaro/emptiness.html Thanissaro Bhikku, "Emptiness", Access to Insight, 8 March 2011, Retrieved July 30, 2013]&lt;/ref&gt; - especially that of unchanging selfhood. Therefore, some Theravadan teachers like [[Thanissaro Bhikku]] hold that emptiness is not so much a metaphysical view, as it is a strategic mode of acting and of seeing the world which leads to liberation:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The idea of emptiness as lack of [[Svabhava|inherent existence]] has very little to do with what the Buddha himself said about emptiness. His teachings on emptiness — as reported in the earliest Buddhist texts, the [[Pali Canon]] — deal directly with actions and their results, with issues of pleasure and pain. To understand and experience emptiness in line with these teachings requires not philosophical sophistication, but a personal integrity willing to admit the actual motivations behind your actions and the actual benefits and harm they cause.&lt;ref name="Thanissaro Bhikkhu 2010"&gt;[http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/thanissaro/integrityofemptiness.html Thanissaro Bhikkhu. "The Integrity of Emptiness" Access to Insight, 5 June 2010, Retrieved on 30 July 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Some Theravadins such as [[David Kalupahana]], see [[Nagarjuna]]'s view of emptiness as compatible with the [[Pali Canon]]. In his analysis of the [[Mulamadhyamikakarika]], Kalupahana sees Nagarjuna's argument as rooted in the [[Kaccānagotta Sutta]] (which Nagarjuna cites by name). Kalupahana states that Nagarjuna's major goal was to discredit heterodox views of [[Svabhava]] (own-nature) held by the [[Sarvastivadins]] and establish the non-substantiality of all dharmas.&lt;ref&gt;Kalupahana, D. Mulamadhyamakakarika of nagarjuna, page 26.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Peter Harvey, the Abhidhamma theory of the Theravadins is not based on the kind of [[Svabhava]] that Nagarjuna was critiquing: "They are dhammas because they are upheld by conditions or they are upheld according to their own nature' (Asl.39). Here 'own-nature' would mean characteristic nature, which is not something inherent in a dhamma as a separate ultimate reality, but arise due to the supporting conditions both of other dhammas and previous occurrences of that dhamma. This is of significance as it makes the Mahayana critique of the Sarvastivadin's notion of own-nature largely irrelevant to the Theravada."&lt;ref&gt;Harvey, Peter. INTRODUCTION TO BUDDHISM, page 87.&lt;/ref&gt;

Emptiness as an approach to meditation is seen as a state in which one is "empty of disturbance." This form of meditation is one in which the meditator becomes concentrated and focuses on the absence or presence of disturbances in their mind, if they find a disturbance they notice it and allow it drop away, this leads to deeper states of calmness.&lt;ref name="Thanissaro Bhikkhu 2010"/&gt; Emptiness is also seen as a way to look at sense experience that does not identify with the "I-making" and "my-making" process of the mind. As a form of meditation, this is developed by perceiving the [[ayatana|six sense spheres]] and their objects as empty of any self, this leads to a [[Arupajhana|formless jhana]] of nothingness and a state of equanimity.&lt;ref name="Thanissaro Bhikkhu 2010"/&gt;

According to [[Gil Fronsdal]]: "Emptiness is as important in the Theravada tradition as it is in the Mahayana.  From the earliest times, Theravada Buddhism has viewed emptiness as one of the important doors to liberation."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.insightmeditationcenter.org/books-articles/articles/emptiness-in-theravada-buddhism/ Emptiness in Theravada Buddhism]&lt;/ref&gt; Mathew Kosuta sees the Abhidhamma teachings of the modern Thai teacher Ajaan Sujin Boriharnwanaket as being very similar to the Mahayana emptiness view.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ahandfulofleaves.org/documents/Articles/Theravada%20Emptiness_The%20Abhidhammic%20theory%20of%20Ajaan%20Sujin%20Boriharnwanaket_Kosuta_2007.pdf Kosuta, Theravada emptiness, The abhidhammic theory of Ajaan Sujin Boriharnwanaket]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Prajna-paramita Sutras===

The Prajna-paramita (Perfection of Wisdom) Sutras taught that all entities, including ''dharmas'', are only conceptual existents or constructs.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Paul. ''Buddhist Thought.'' Routledge, 2000, pages 68, 134-5.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Paul. ''Mahayana Buddhism: The Doctrinal Foundations 2nd edition.'' Routledge, 2009, pages 52-3.&lt;/ref&gt;

Though we perceive a world of concrete and discrete objects, these objects are "empty" of the identity imputed by their designated labels.{{sfn|Kalupahan|1994|p=160-169}} The [[Heart sutra]], a text from the [[Prajnaparamita|prajnaparamita-sutras]], articulates this in the following saying in which the [[Skandha|five skandhas]] are said to be "empty":
{{quote|Form is emptiness, emptiness is form&lt;br&gt;Emptiness is not separate from form, form is not separate from emptiness&lt;br&gt;Whatever is form is emptiness, whatever is emptiness is form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.buddhanet.net/e-learning/heartstr.htm |title=The Heart Sutra Prajna Paramita Hrydaya Sutra |publisher=Buddhanet.net |date= |accessdate=2013-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=note|Original: "Rupan śūnyatā śūnyatāiva rupan.

===Mādhyamaka===
{{Main|Madhyamaka}}
[[File:Dew on grass Luc Viatour.jpg|thumb|The emptiness of phenomena is often compared to drops of [[dew]]]]
Mādhyamaka is a [[Mahayana|Mahāyāna]] [[Buddhist philosophy|Buddhist school of philosophy]] established by the Indian Buddhist philosopher [[Nagarjuna]].&lt;ref name="Buddhist Thought"&gt;[[Paul Williams (British professor)|Williams, Paul]] (2000). ''Buddhist Thought'' Routledge, p140.&lt;/ref&gt; In Madhyamaka, to say that an object is "empty" is synonymous with saying that it is [[Pratītyasamutpāda|dependently originated]], which means, it's affected by the [[three marks of existence]]: it is fated to be [[Impermanence|transient]], [[Dukkha|unsatisfactory]], and [[Anatta|without inherent existence]].

Madhyamaka states that impermanent collections of causes and conditions are designated by mere conceptual labels. This also applies to the principle of causality itself, since ''everything'' is dependently originated.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Paul. ''Buddhist Thought.'' Routledge 2000, page 142.&lt;/ref&gt; If unaware of this, things may seem to arise as existents, remain for a time and then subsequently perish. In reality, dependently originated phenomena do not arise as having inherent existence in the first place.&lt;ref name="Tsondru, Mabja 2011, pages 56-58"&gt;Tsondru, Mabja. ''Ornament of Reason.'' Snow Lion Publications. 2011, pages 56-58, 405-417.&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=note|Chapter 21 of the Mūlamadhyamakakārikā goes into the reasoning behind this.&lt;ref name="Tsondru, Mabja 2011, pages 56-58"/&gt;}} Thus both existence and nihilism are ruled out.&lt;ref&gt;Tsondru, Mabja. ''Ornament of Reason.'' Snow Lion Publications. 2011, pages 56-58, 405-417&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;unclear&lt;/ref&gt;

====Nagarjuna====
Madhyamaka is retroactively seen as being founded by the monk [[Nāgārjuna]]. Nāgārjuna's goal was to refute the essentialism of certain [[Abhidharma]] schools.&lt;ref&gt;Wasler, Joseph. ''Nagarjuna in Context.'' New York: Columibia University Press. 2005, pgs. 225-263.&lt;/ref&gt; His best-known work is the [[Mūlamadhyamakakārikā]], in which he used the ''[[Prasaṅgika|reductio ad absurdum]]'' to show the non-substantiality of the perceived world.

[[Nāgārjuna]] equates emptiness with [[dependent origination]]:&lt;ref&gt;Tsondru, Mabja. ''Ornament of Reason.'' Snow Lion Publications. 2011, pages 66-71, 447-477.&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=note|[[Mūlamadhyamakakārikā]] 24:18}}
{{quote|On the basis of the Buddha's view that all experienced phenomena (''dharma'') are "dependently arisen" (''pratitya-samutpanna''), Nagarjuna insisted that such phenomena are empty (''sunya''). This did not mean that they are not experienced and, therefore, non-existent; only that they are devoid of a permanent and eternal substance (''[[Svabhāva|svabhava]]''). Since they are experienced elements of existence, they are not mere names (''prjnapti'').{{sfn|Kalupahana|1992|p=120}}}}

In his analysis, any enduring [[Svabhāva|essential nature]] would prevent the process of dependent origination, or any kind of origination at all. For things would simply always have been, and will always continue to be, without any change.&lt;ref&gt;Tsondru, Mabja. ''Ornament of Reason.'' Snow Lion Publications. 2011, pages 40-41, 322-333.&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=note|Nāgārjuna equates svabhāva (essence) with bhāva (existence) in Chapter 15 of the Mūlamadhyamakakārikā}}

In doing so, he restores the [[Middle way]] of the Buddha, which had become influenced by absolute tendencies:{{sfn|Kalupahana|1994}}
{{quote|Utilizing the Buddha's theory of "dependent arising" (''pratitya-samutpanna'') Nagarjuna demonstrated the futility of these metaphysical speculations. His method of dealing with such metaphysics is referred to as a "middle way" (''madhyama pratipad''). It is the middle way that avoided the substantialism of the [[Sarvastivada|Sarvastivadins]] as well as the [[nominalism]] of the [[Sautrāntika|Sautrantikas]].{{sfn|Kalupahana|1992|p=120}}}}

==== Svatantrika-Prasaṅgika distinction====
{{Main|Svatantrika-Prasaṅgika distinction}}

In Tibetan Buddhism, especially in the Gelugpa, a distinction is being made between Svatantrika and Prasaṅgika approaches to reasoning.

''Svātantrika'' is attributed primarily to the 6th century Indian scholar [[Bhavaviveka]], who argued for the use of syllogistical statements in the propagation of Madhyamaka, in line with the developing Buddhist logic. It is used in contrast with [[Prasangika|Prāsangika]] Madhyamaka. According to Tsonghkhapa, for the Svatantrika conventional phenomena are understood to have a conventional essential existence, but without an ultimately existing essence.

The name ''Prasangika'' is derived from ''[[Prasaṅgika|prasanga]]'', or ''[[reductio ad absurdum]]'' arguments, rather than ''[[Svatantrika|svatantra-anumana]]'', or ''[[Syllogism|independent syllogisms]]''. [[Buddhapalita]] (470–550) are regarded as the main proponents of the Prasaṅgika, which argues that only arguments should be used which lay bare the logical inconstencies of their opponents.

====Nihilism and eternalism====
{{see also|Middle way}}

Some non-Buddhist and Buddhist writers state that the Sunyata concept in Madhyamaka philosophy is nihilistic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Junjirō Takakusu|title=The Essentials of Buddhist Philosophy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oyJjCx_tEiMC&amp;pg=PA4 |year=1998|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass |isbn=978-81-208-1592-6|pages=4, 105–107 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Hajime Nakamura |title=Ways of Thinking of Eastern Peoples: India, China, Tibet, Japan |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=i9gm9CzNd5EC |year=1991|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass |isbn=978-81-208-0764-8 |pages=590–591 footnote 20 }}, Quote: "Already in India, 'sunyata' was liable to be misunderstood as nothingness or nihil'. (...) The [[Sarvastivada|Sarvastivadins]] of Hinayana Buddhism viewed the Madhyamika school as 'one that argues that everything is nothing. (...) It is only natural that most of the Western scholars call the ''prajnaparamita sutra'' or the doctrine of the Madhyamika school nihilism since criticisms were already expressed in India. Against such criticisms, however, Nagarjuna, founder of the Madhyamika school says, 'you are ignorant of the function of sunyata, the meaning of the sunyata and sunyata itself'."&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Jackson writes:
{{quote|A nihilistic interpretation of the concept of voidness (or of mind-only) is not, by any means, a merely hypothetical possibility; it consistently was adopted by Buddhism's opponents, wherever the religion spread, nor have Buddhists themselves been immune to it...&lt;ref name="Jackson_1993_57"&gt;{{harvnb|Jackson|1993|p=57}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

This view has been challenged by other writers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=G. C. Nayak |title=Mādhyamika Śūnyatā, a Reappraisal: A Reappraisal of Mādhyamika Philosophical Enterprise with Special Reference to Nāgārjuna and Chandrakīrti |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CjkRAQAAIAAJ |date=2001 |publisher=Indian Council of Philosophical Research |isbn=978-81-85636-47-4 |pages=9–12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars interpret emptiness as described by Nāgārjuna as a Buddhist transcendental [[Absolute (philosophy)|absolute]] such as ''Tathagata'', while other scholars consider it a mistake.&lt;ref name=ferrer102&gt;Jorge Noguera Ferrer, ''Revisioning Transpersonal Theory: A Participatory Vision of Human Spirituality.'' SUNY Press, 2002, page 102-103.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Jorge Ferrer, Nāgārjuna presents the middle way, one between nihilism and absolute eternalism, and sunyata as emptiness is the soteriological middle way.&lt;ref name=ferrer102/&gt;

Randall Collins states that for Nagarjuna, ultimate reality was "shunyata, emptiness".&lt;ref name=collins221&gt;Randall Collins, ''The Sociology of Philosophies: A Global Theory of Intellectual Change.'' Harvard University Press, 2000, pages 221-222.&lt;/ref&gt; In Nagarjuna's thesis, adds Collins, this emptiness is not a negation, but the premise that "no concepts are intelligible".&lt;ref name=collins221/&gt; David Kalupahana states that this topic has been debated by ancient and medieval Buddhist metaphysicians, with a divergence of views; emptiness is a view, adds Kalupahana, but "holding up emptiness as an absolute or ultimate truth without reference to that which is empty is the last thing either the Buddha or Nāgārjuna would advocate".&lt;ref&gt;[[David J. Kalupahana]], ''Mulamadhyamakakarika of Nagarjuna: The Philosophy of the Middle Way.'' SUNY Press, 1986, pages 48-50.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Ferrer, Nāgārjuna criticized those whose mind held any "positions and beliefs", suggesting liberation is "avoidance of all views", and explaining emptiness as follows:&lt;ref&gt;Jorge Noguera Ferrer, ''Revisioning Transpersonal Theory: A Participatory Vision of Human Spirituality.'' SUNY Press, 2002, pages 102. The quote is from the [[Mūlamadhyamakakārikā]].&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|The Victorious Ones have announced that emptiness is the relinquishing of all [[View (Buddhism)|views]]. Those who are possessed of the view of emptiness are said to be incorrigible.}}

===Yogacara===
{{Main|Yogacara}}
[[Yogacara]] explains "emptiness" in an analysis of the way we perceive "things". Everything we conceive of is the result of the working of the [[Skandha|five skandhas]]: form, perception, feeling, volition and discrimination.{{refn|group=note|Translations do differ, which makes a difference. [[Vijñāna]] can be translated as "consciousness", but also as "discernement".{{sfn|Kalupahana|1992}}}} The five skandhas together create consciousness.

===Buddha-nature and Yogacara-Madhyamaka===
{{Main|Buddha-nature|Tathāgatagarbha Sutras}}

An influential division of 1st-millennium CE Buddhist texts develop the notion of Buddha-nature.&lt;ref name="PW_103_109"&gt;{{cite book|author=Paul Williams|title=Mahayana Buddhism: The Doctrinal Foundations|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GMN-AgAAQBAJ|year=2008|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-134-25056-1|pages=103–109}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=S.

The notion of Buddha-nature was opposed within the later Tibetan Gelugpa school, because they imply a "self-like" concept.&lt;ref name="PW_103_109"/&gt;

====''Tathāgatagarbha sūtras''====
The Tathāgatagarbha is the topic of the ''[[Tathāgatagarbha sūtras]]'', where the title itself means a ''garbha'' (womb, matrix, seed) containing ''Tathagata'' (Buddha). In the ''Tathāgatagarbha sūtras'' sutras the perfection of the wisdom of not-self is stated to be the true self. The ultimate goal of the path is characterized using a range of positive language that had been used in Indian philosophy previously by [[Essentialism|essentialist]] philosophers, but which was now transmuted into a new Buddhist vocabulary to describe a being who has successfully completed the Buddhist path.&lt;ref&gt;Sallie B. King (1997),[https://web.archive.org/web/20070927131119/http://www.nanzan-u.ac.jp/SHUBUNKEN/publications/nlarc/pdf/Pruning%20the%20bodhi%20tree/Pruning%209.pdf  ''The Doctrine of Buddha Nature is Impeccably Buddhist'']. In: Jamie Hubbard (ed.), Pruning the Bodhi Tree: The Storm Over Critical Buddhism, Univ of Hawaii Press 1997, pp. 174-192. {{ISBN|0824819497}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These [[Sutra]]s suggest, states Paul Williams, that 'all sentient beings contain a Tathagata' as their 'essence, core or essential inner nature'.&lt;ref name=paulwilliamsp104&gt;{{cite book|author=Paul Williams|title=Mahayana Buddhism: The Doctrinal Foundations|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GMN-AgAAQBAJ|year=2008|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-134-25056-1|page=104}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Tathāgatagarbha'' sutras presents a further developed understanding of emptiness, wherein the Buddha Nature, the Buddha and Liberation are seen as transcending the realm of emptiness, i.e. of the conditioned and dependently originated phenomena.{{sfn|Hopkins|2006}}

The ''[[Srimala Sutra|Śrīmālā Sūtra]]'' is one of the earliest texts on tathagata-garbha thought, composed in 3rd century in south India, according to Brian Brown. It asserted that everyone can potentially attain Buddhahood, and warns against the doctrine of Sunyata.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Brian Edward Brown |title=The Buddha Nature: A Study of the Tathāgatagarbha and Ālayavijñāna|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eXnF2dolnNgC |year=1991|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass |isbn=978-81-208-0631-3 |pages=3–4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Śrīmālā Sūtra'' posits that the Buddha-nature is ultimately identifiable as the [[dharmakaya|supramundane nature of the Buddha]], the ''garbha'' is the ground for Buddha-nature, this nature is unborn and undying, has ultimate existence, has no beginning nor end, is nondual, and permanent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Brian Edward Brown |title=The Buddha Nature: A Study of the Tathāgatagarbha and Ālayavijñāna|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eXnF2dolnNgC |year=1991|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass |isbn=978-81-208-0631-3 |pages=4–5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The text also adds that the ''garbha'' has "no self, soul or personality" and "incomprehensible to anyone distracted by sunyata (voidness)"; rather it is the support for phenomenal existence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Brian Edward Brown |title=The Buddha Nature: A Study of the Tathāgatagarbha and Ālayavijñāna|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eXnF2dolnNgC |year=1991|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass |isbn=978-81-208-0631-3 |pages=5–7, 32 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another seminal text, which was and is influential in Tibetan Buddhism, is the [[Ratnagotravibhāga]] sutra. It forms the basis of [[shentong]], a further developed form of Madhyamaka, in which the realization of emptiness is a preliminary stage to realize the [[Nature of mind (Buddhism)|nature of mind]], the self-reflexive nature of consciousness which shines through when it is freed from the defilements. Moderate shentong-views are still being taught in the Nyingma and Kagyu lineages, despite the fierce resistance and persecution by Gelugpas in previous centuries.

====Scholarly opinions====
While highly influential in Indian and east Asian Buddhism, for western scholars the ''Tathagatagarbha '' doctrine of an 'essential nature' in every living being appears to be confusing, since it seems to be equivalent to a 'Self',{{refn|group=note|Paul Williams: "Some texts of the ''tathagatagarbha'' literature, such as the ''Mahaparinirvana Sutra'' actually refer to an ''atman'', though other texts are careful to avoid the term. This would be in direct opposition to the general teachings of Buddhism on ''anatta''. Indeed, the distinctions between the general Indian concept of ''atman'' and the popular Buddhist concept of Buddha-nature are often blurred to the point that writers consider them to be synonymous."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Paul Williams|title=Mahayana Buddhism: The Doctrinal Foundations|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GMN-AgAAQBAJ|year=2008|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-134-25056-1|pages=104–105, 108}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Merv Fowler|title=Buddhism: Beliefs and Practices|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=A7UKjtA0QDwC|year=1999|publisher=Sussex Academic Press|isbn=978-1-898723-66-0|pages=101–102}}&lt;/ref&gt; which seems to contradict the doctrines in a vast majority of Buddhist texts. Some scholars, however, view such teachings as metaphorical, not to be taken literally.{{sfn|Hopkins|2006}} Wayman and Wayman have also disagreed with this literalist view, and they state that the ''Tathagatagarbha'' is neither self nor sentient being, nor soul, nor personality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Paul Williams|title=Mahayana Buddhism: The Doctrinal Foundations|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GMN-AgAAQBAJ|year=2008|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-134-25056-1|page=107}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to some scholars, the [[Buddha nature]] which these sutras discuss, does not represent a substantial self (''ātman''). Rather, it is a positive expression of emptiness, and represents the potentiality to realize Buddhahood through Buddhist practices. In this view, the intention of the teaching of Buddha nature is [[soteriology|soteriological]] rather than theoretical.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Heng-Ching Shih |title=The Significance Of 'Tathagatagarbha' —- A Positive Expression Of Sunyata |url=http://budsas.org/ebud/ebdha191.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130807082256/http://budsas.org/ebud/ebdha191.htm |archivedate=2013-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nanzan-u.ac.jp"&gt;{{cite web |first=Sallie B. |last=King |title=The Doctrine of Buddha Nature is Impeccably Buddhist.

''Mahayanism'', Tokyo: Karin Bunko, p.56&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Matsumoto Shiro and Hakamaya Noriaki, the idea of an ontological reality of the Buddha-nature is an un-Buddhist idea:&lt;ref name="nanzan-u.ac.jp"/&gt; Their "Critical Buddhism" approach rejects what it calls "''dhatu-vada''" (substantialist Buddha nature doctrines)
{{quote|Buddhism is based on the principles of no-self and causation, which deny any substance underlying the phenomenal world. The idea of ''tathagata-garbha'', on the contrary, posits a substance (namely, ''tathagata''-''garbha'') as the basis of the phenomenal world. [Matsumoto Shiro] asserts that ''dhatu-vada'' is the object that the Buddha criticized in founding Buddhism, and that Buddhism is nothing but unceasing critical activity against any form of ''dhatu-vada''.&lt;ref&gt;''Pruning the Bodhi Tree: the Storm over Critical Buddhism'' by Jamie Hubbard and Paul Loren Swanson, University of Hawai'i Press, 1997, p. 326&lt;/ref&gt;}}
The critical Buddhism approach has, in turn, recently been characterised as operating with a restricted definition of Buddhism.  Paul Williams comments:
{{quote|At least some ways of understanding the ''tathagatagarbha'' contravene the teachings of not-Self, or the Madhyamika idea of emptiness. And these ways of understanding the ''tathagatagarbha'' were and are widespread in Mahāyāna Buddhism. Yet by their own self-definition they are Buddhist.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Williams, ''Mahayana Buddhism: The Doctrinal Foundations'', Second Edition, Routledge, London, 2009, pp. 124, 125&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Tibetan Buddhism===
[[File:Appearance of sky for weather forecast, Dhaka, Bangladesh.JPG|thumb|In Tibetan Buddhism, emptiness is often symbolized by and compared to the open sky&lt;ref&gt;Vessantara; Meeting the Buddhas: A Guide to Buddhas, Bodhisattvas, and Tantric Deities. "They [conditioned things] are sky-like, and un-graspable, like clouds."&lt;/ref&gt; which is associated with [[openness]] and [[freedom]].&lt;ref&gt;The Collected Works of Chogyam Trungpa: Volume Four, Dawn of tantra, page 366&lt;/ref&gt;]]

[[Tibetan Buddhism]] developed five main schools. The Madhyamika philosophy obtained a central position in all the schools, but with two distinct variations:{{sfn|Cornu|2001|p=145, 150}}
* Rangtong, c.q. Prasangika-Madhyamaka, which is taught by the Gelugpa, but also by the Nyingma and Sakya:
:* Tsongkhapa, and the subsequent Gelugpa tradition, lay emphasis on a strict [[Prasangika]] interpretation of emptiness. It sees its own interpretation as the final truth on ''sunyata''.
:* The [[Nyingma]] and the Sakya-school teach that emptiness goes further than a mere denial of inherently existing, with the Dzogchen (Nyingma) tradition pointing to the ''[[nature of mind]]''. 
* Shentong, which is a further developed Yogacara-Madhyamaka and influenced by Buddha-nature teachings, and taught in Jonang and Kagyu.

====Strict emptiness – Gelugpa====
The [[Gelug|Gelugpa school]] of Tibetan Buddhism is the most influential of the four Tibetan Buddhist schools. It was founded in the beginning of the 15th century by [[Je Tsongkhapa|Tsongkhapa]] (1357–1419), who was "strongly scholastic in orientation and encouraged the study of the great Indian masters of philosophy".{{sfn|Snelling|1987|p=207}}

The [[14th Dalai Lama]], who generally speaks from the Gelugpa version of the ''Mādhyamaka-[[Prasangika|Prasaṅgika]]'', states:
{{quote|According to the theory of emptiness, any belief in an objective reality grounded in the assumption of intrinsic, independent existence is simply untenable.&lt;br&gt;All things and events, whether 'material', mental or even abstract concepts like time, are devoid of objective, independent existence ... [T]hings and events are 'empty' in that they can never possess any immutable essence, intrinsic reality or absolute 'being' that affords independence.&lt;ref&gt;Dalai Lama (2005).

====Nature of mind====

=====Nyingma/Dzogchen=====
{{expand section|date=August 2017}}

In Dzogchen, emptiness does not refer to the mere negation of inherent existence, but to profound emptiness, the Ground and nature of mind which is free from temporary characteristics.

=====Bon=====
The Tibetan [[Bon#Yungdrung Bon|Yungdrung Bon-tradition]] regards the Ma Gyu, or [[Anuttarayoga Tantra#Mother Tantras|Mother Tantra]], as the highest tantra.

=====Sakya=====
The [[Sakya|Sakya school]] originated in the 11th century. It rose to power in the 13th century.{{sfn|Snelling|1987|p=202}} [[Gorampa|Gorampa Sonam Senge]] (1429-1489), an important philosopher in the [[Sakya]] school of [[Tibetan Buddhism]], established an understandings of [[Prasangika]] which differs from Tsongkhapa. According to Gorampa, emptiness is not just mere emptiness, the absence of inherent existence, but profound emptiness, the absence of the four extremes in phenomena. In Gorampa's approach, ultimate truth is a liberating insight, that is free from even grasping the mind.&lt;ref&gt;Cabezón, José Ignacio. ''Freedom from extremes: Gorampa's "Distinguishing the views" and the Polemics of Emptiness.'' Wisdom Publications, 2007, pages 50-52.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Shentong (Buddha-nature)====

=====Jonang=====
{{Main|Jonang}}
The Jonang school originated in the 12th century. Tsongkhapa strongly opposed the Jonang school, whose views he "deemed to be ... dharmically incorrect".{{sfn|Snelling|1987|p=207}}

In the Tibetan [[Jonang]] school, only the Buddha and the Buddha Nature are viewed as ''not'' intrinsically empty, but as truly real, unconditioned, and replete with eternal, changeless virtues.{{sfn|Hopkins|2006|p=8-16}} The Buddha Nature ([[tathagatagarbha]]) is only empty of what is impermanent and conditioned, not of its own self. The Buddha Nature is truly real, and primordially present in all beings.

An important Tibetan treatise on Emptiness and the Buddha Nature is found in the scholar-monk [[Dolpopa|Dolpopa's]] voluminous study, ''Mountain Doctrine''.{{sfn|Hopkins|2006}} It... 
{{quote| ... follows the format, inherited from India, of a presentation by way of both reasoning and scripture - the scriptural citations being so rich that the book can also be considered an inspiring anthology, a veritable treasure-trove of literature about the [[Buddha-nature|matrix-of-one-gone-thus]].{{sfn|Hopkins|2006|p=5}}}}

In this vast ''Mountain Doctrine'', [[Dolpopa]] describes the Buddha Nature as ...
{{quote|[N]on-material emptiness, emptiness that is far from an annihilatory emptiness, great emptiness that is the ultimate pristine wisdom of superiors ...buddha earlier than all buddhas, ... causeless original buddha.{{sfn|Hopkins|2006|p=14}}}}

The Buddha-nature is filled with eternal powers and virtues:
{{quote|[P]ermanent, stable, eternal, everlasting. Not compounded by causes and conditions, the matrix-of-one-gone-thus is intrinsically endowed with ultimate buddha qualities of body, speech, and mind such as the ten powers; it is not something that did not exist before and is newly produced; it is self-arisen.'{{sfn|Hopkins|2006|p=8}}}}

Dolpopa also cites the ''[[Angulimaliya Sutra|Angulimaliya Sutra&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s]]'' contrast between empty phenomena such as the moral and emotional afflictions (''[[Kleshas (Buddhism)|kleshas]]''), which are like ephemeral hailstones, and the enduring, eternal Buddha, which is like a precious gem:
{{quote|Empty phenomena are other [different]; non-empty phenomena are other [different]. The tens of millions of afflictive emotions like hail-stones are empty. The phenomena in the class of non-virtues, like hail-stones, quickly disintegrate. Buddha, like a vaidurya jewel, is permanent ... The liberation of a buddha also is form ... do not make a discrimination of non-division, saying, "The character of liberation is empty".'{{sfn|Hopkins|2006|p=210}}}}

=====Kagyu=====
The Kagyu teacher [[Khenpo Tsultrim Gyamtso Rinpoche|Khenpo Tsultrim]], in ''Progressive Stages of Meditation on Emptiness'', presents five strages of meditation, which he relates to five different schools or approaches:{{sfn|Hookham|1991|p=19-26}}{{sfn|Khenpo Tsultrim Gyamtso|1994}}
* "Sravaka meditation on non-self" – meditation on the emptiness of the skandhas and the non-existence of a personal self;
* "Cittamatra-approach" – meditation on the mind-stream, the ever-continuing process of perception, and the non-duality of perceived and perceiver;
* "Svatantrika-Madhyamaka approach" – meditation on all dhammas, which are empty of self-nature, and the negation of any "substance";
* "Prasangika-Mdhyamaka approach" – meditation on "the non-conceptual (nisprapanca) nature of both the appearance of phenomena and their self-emptiness." In this approach, all concepts are to be abandoned;
*  Shentong Madhyamaka – meditation on ''Paramarthasatya'' ("Absolute Reality"),{{sfn|Hookham|1991|p=21}}{{refn|group=note|name="Absolute"|According to Hookham, non-dual experience is Ultimate Reality.{{sfn|Hookham|1991|p=37}}}} ''Buddhajnana'',{{refn|group=note|name="Buddhajnana"|According to Hookham, "The Chinese Tathagarba schools describe Buddhajnana as the totality of all that is, which pervades every part of all that is in its totality."{{sfn|Hookham|1991|p=37}} According to Hookham, for Shentong Buddhajnana is "the non-dual nature of Mind completely unobscured and endowed with its countless Buddha Qualities (''Buddhagunas'').{{sfn|Hookham|1991|p=37}}}} which is beyond concepts, and described by terms as "truly existing."{{sfn|Hookham|1991|p=22}} This approach helps "to overcome certain residual subtle concepts,"{{sfn|Hookham|1991|p=22}} and "the habit – fosterd on the earlier stages of the path – of negating whatever experience arises in his/her mind."{{sfn|Hookham|1991|p=23}} It destroys false concepts, as does prasangika, but it also alerts the practitioner "to the presence of a dynamic, positive Reality that is to be experienced once the conceptual mind is defeated."{{sfn|Hookham|1991|p=23}}

===Chinese Buddhism===
When Buddhism was introduced in China it was understood in terms of its own culture. Various sects struggled to attain an understanding of the Indian texts. The [[Tathāgatagarbha Sutras]] and the idea of the [[Buddha-nature]] were endorsed, because of the perceived similarities with the [[Tao]], which was understood as a transcendental reality underlying the world of appearances. [[Sunyata]] at first was also understood as pointing to transcendental reality.{{sfn|Lai|Year unknown}} It took [[Chinese Buddhism]] several centuries to realize that [[sunyata]] does not refer to an essential transcendental reality underneath or behind the world of appearances.{{sfn|Lai|Year unknown}}

====Chán====
{{Main|Zen|Chinese Chán}}
The influence of those various doctrinal and textual backgrounds is still discernable in Zen. Zen teachers still mention the Buddha-nature, but the Zen tradition also emphasizes that Buddha-nature is Sunyata, the absence of an independent and substantial "self".{{sfn|Lai|Year unknown}}

===Western Buddhism===
Various western Buddhists note that ''sunyata'' refers to the emptiness of inherent existence, as in Madhyamaka; but also to the emptiness of mind or awareness, as open space and the "ground of being," as in meditation-orientated traditions and approaches such as Dzogchen and [[Shentong]].{{sfn|Snelling|1987|p=101-102}}{{sfn|Knibbe|2014|p=46}}&lt;ref group=web name="Wellings"&gt;Nigel Wellings (2009), ''[http://www.contemplativeforum.co.uk/wordpress/?p=204 Is there anything there? – the Tibetan Rangtong Shentong debate] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150518063508/http://www.contemplativeforum.co.uk/wordpress/?p=204 |date=2015-05-18 }}''&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=note|Quotes:&lt;br&gt;* John Snelling: "At the core of Mahayana philosophy lies the notion of Emptiness: ''Shunyata''. This is very much in the spirit of ''anatta'' (Skt. ''anatman'') as first taught by the Buddha. It is often used to imply, not mere or sheer nothingness (that would be the nihilistic view), but 'emptiness of ''inherent existence'''; that is, the absence of any kind of enduring or self-sustaining essence. There is also a sense in which it has connotations of 'conceptual emptiness': absence of thoughts. It could be regarded too as a non-term signifying the ineffable understanding arising within the practice of meditation. Although seemingly negative, it also has its positive uses - and of course ultimately points beyond the positive negative dichotomy."{{sfn|Snelling|1987|p=101-102}}&lt;br&gt;* Hans Knibbe: "There are at least to important meanings of this concept of emptiness, namely:&lt;br&gt; - empty of independent existence;&lt;br&gt; - openness and space as grounf of being.{{sfn|Knibbe|2014|p=46}}&lt;br&gt;* Nigel Wellings:&lt;ref group=web name ="Wellings"/&gt; "Thus we have two types of emptiness, the emptiness of self in the skandhas that reveals the absence of an empirical and metaphysical self. And the emptiness of the self in Nirvâ.na that reveals nothing of the empirical self existing within the Nirvâ.na consciousness.&lt;br&gt;Harvey seems to confirm this view when he tells us that all conditioned dharmas are empty of self because they are impermanent and a source of suffering, while the unconditioned dharma, Nirvâ.na, is empty because it does not “support the feeling of ‘I-ness’”, that is, the impermanent skandhas. (1990:52). This is very similar to the teaching of the modern Kagyu Nyingma Lama, Tulku Urgyen Rinpoche, a Shentong exponent:
{{quote|All appearances are empty, in that they can be destroyed or extinguished in some way [...] The whole universe vanishes at some point, destroyed by the seven fires and one immense deluge. In this way, all appearances are empty.&lt;br&gt;Mind is also ultimately empty, but its way of being empty is not the same as appearances. [My italics] Mind can experience anything but it cannot be destroyed. Its original nature is the dharmakaya of all Buddhas. You cannot actually do anything to mind – you can’t change it, wash it away, bury it or burn it. What is truly empty, though, is all the appearances that appear in the mind. (Tulku Urgyen (1999), ''As It Is vol.1'' Rangjang Yeshe, Boudhanath, Hong Kong &amp; Nasby. p.53)}}}}

==Hinduism==

===Influence on Advaita Vedanta===
Gaudapada is considered by some scholars to have been strongly influenced by Buddhism, as he developed his concept of [[Ajativada|"ajāta"]] from Nagajurna's Madhyamaka philosophy,{{sfn|Renard|2010|p=157}}{{sfn|Comans|2000|p=35-36}} which uses the term "anutpāda":{{sfn|Bhattacharya|1943|p=49}}
* "An" means "not", or "non"
* "Utpāda" means "genesis", "coming forth", "birth"&lt;ref&gt;[http://spokensanskrit.de/index.php?tinput=utpAda&amp;script=&amp;direction=SE&amp;link=yes Sanskrit Dictionary for Spoken Sanskrit, ''Utpāda'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Taken together "anutpāda" means "having no origin", "not coming into existence", "not taking effect", "non-production".&lt;ref&gt;[http://spokensanskrit.de/index.php?script=HK&amp;beginning=0+&amp;tinput=anutpAda+&amp;trans=Translate&amp;direction=AU Sanskrit Dictionary for Spoken Sanskrit, ''Anutpāda'']&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Gaudapada, the Absolute is not subject to [[Saṃsāra|birth, change and death]]. The Absolute is ''aja'', the unborn eternal.{{sfn|Sarma|1996|p=127}} The [[Empiricism|empirical world]] of [[phenomenon|appearances]] is considered [[Maya (illusion)|Maya]] (unreal as it is transitory), and not [[Philosophical realism|absolutely existent]].{{sfn|Sarma|1996|p=127}} Thus, Gaudapada's concept of ''ajativada'' is similar to Buddhist term "anutpāda" for the absence of an origin{{sfn|Renard|2010|p=157}}{{sfn|Bhattacharya|1943|p=49}} or śūnyatā.{{sfn|Renard|2010|p=160}}{{refn|group=note|The term is also used in the ''[[Laṅkāvatāra Sūtra]]''.{{sfn|Suzuki|1999}} According to D.T Suzuki, "anutpada" is not the opposite of "utpada", but transcends opposites. It is [[kenshō]], seeing into the true nature of existence,{{sfn|Suzuki|1999|p=123-124}} the seeing that "all objects are without self-substance [Sunyata]".{{sfn|Suzuki|1999|p=168}}}}

But Gaudapada's perspective is quite different from Nagarjuna.{{sfn|Comans|2000|p=36}} Gaudapada's perspective found in ''Mandukya Karika'' is based on the ''[[Mandukya Upanishad]]''.{{sfn|Comans|2000|p=36}} According to Gaudapada, the metaphysical absolute called [[Brahman]] never changes, while the phenomenal world changes continuously, so the phenomenal world cannot arise independently from Brahman. If the world cannot arise, yet is an empirical fact, than the perceived world has to be a transitory (unreal) appearance of Brahman. And if the phenomenal world is a transitory appearance, then there is no real origination or destruction, only apparent origination or destruction. From the level of ultimate truth (''paramārthatā'') the phenomenal world is ''[[Maya (illusion)|māyā]]'', "illusion",{{sfn|Comans|2000|p=36}} apparently existing but ultimately not metaphysically real.{{sfn|Hiriyanna|2000|p=25, 160-161}}

In ''Gaudapada-Karika'', chapter III, verses 46-48, he states that [[Brahman]] never arises, is never born, is never unborn, it rests in itself:
{{quote|
When the mind does not lie low, and is not again tossed about, then that being without movement, and not presenting any appearance, culminates into [[Brahman]]. Resting in itself, calm, with Nirvana, indescribable, highest happiness, unborn and one with the unborn knowable, omniscient they say. No creature whatever is born, no origination of it exists or takes place. This is that highest truth where nothing whatever is born.
|Gaudapada Karika|3.46-48, Translated by RD Karmarkar&lt;ref&gt;RD Karmarkar, [https://archive.org/stream/Gaudapada-Karika.English/Gaudapada-Karika#page/n83/mode/2up Gaudapada's Karika], Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In contrast to Renard's view,{{sfn|Renard|2010|p=157}} Karmarkar states the Ajativada of Gaudapada has nothing in common with the ''Śūnyatā'' concept in Buddhism.&lt;ref&gt;RD Karmarkar, [https://archive.org/stream/Gaudapada-Karika.English/Gaudapada-Karika#page/n45/mode/2up/search/ajativada Gaudapada's Karika], Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute, pages xxxix-xl&lt;/ref&gt; While the language of Gaudapada is undeniably similar to those found in Mahayana Buddhism, states Comans, their perspective is different because unlike Buddhism, Gaudapada is relying on the premise of "Brahman, [[Atman (Hinduism)|Atman]] or Turiya" exist and are the nature of absolute reality.{{sfn|Comans|2000|p=36}}

===In Shaivism===
''Sunya'' and ''Sunyatisunya'' are concepts which appear in some [[Shaivism|Shaiva]] texts, such as the [[Vijñāna Bhairava Tantra]], which contains several verses mentioning voidness as a feature of ultimate reality - [[Shiva]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"The Absolute void is Bhairava who is beyond the senses and the mind, beyond all the categories of these instruments. From the point of view of the human mins, He is most void. from the point of view of Reality, He is most full, for He is the source of all manifestation."&lt;ref&gt;Jaideva Singh, Vijnanabhairava or Divine Consciousness: A Treasury of 112 Types of Yoga, page 29&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"The yogi should concentrate intensely on the idea (and also feel) that this universe is totally void. In that void, his mind would become absorbed. Then he becomes highly qualified for absorption i.e. his mind is absorbed in the absolute void (sunyatisunya)."&lt;ref&gt;Jaideva Singh, Vijnanabhairava or Divine Consciousness: A Treasury of 112 Types of Yoga, page 55&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In a series of Kannada language texts of [[Lingayatism]], a Shaivism tradition, ''shunya'' is equated to the concept of the Supreme. In particular, the ''Shunya Sampadane'' texts present the ideas of [[Allama Prabhu]] in a form of dialogue, where ''shunya'' is that void and distinctions which a spiritual journey seeks to fill and eliminate. It is the described as a state of union of one's soul with the infinite Shiva, the state of blissful moksha.&lt;ref name="Dalal2010p388"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Stephan Schuhmacher|title=The Encyclopedia of Eastern Philosophy and Religion: Buddhism, Hinduism, Taoism, Zen |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vpP8770qVakC |year=1994|publisher=Shambhala|isbn=978-0-87773-980-7|page=202}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In Vaishnavism===
''Shunya Brahma'' is a concept found in certain texts of [[Vaishnavism]], particularly in [[Odia language|Odiya]], such as the poetic ''Panchasakhas''. It explains the ''Nirguna Brahman'' idea of Vedanta, that is the eternal unchanging metaphysical reality as "personified void". Alternate names for this concept of Hinduism, include ''shunya purusha'' and ''Jagannatha'' (Vishnu) in certain text.&lt;ref name="Dalal2010p388"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Chittaranjan Das|title=Bhakta Charana Das (Medieval Oriya Writer)|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2QowAAAAMAAJ |year=1994|publisher=Sahitya Akademi|isbn=978-81-7201-716-3|pages=9, 101–112}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, both in Lingayatism and various flavors of Vaishnavism such as ''Mahima Dharma'', the idea of ''Shunya'' is closer to the Hindu concept of metaphysical ''[[Brahman]]'', rather than to the ''Śūnyatā'' concept of Buddhism.&lt;ref name="Dalal2010p388"/&gt; However, there is some overlap, such as in the works of Bhima Bhoi.&lt;ref name="Dalal2010p388"&gt;{{cite book|author=Roshen Dalal|title=Hinduism: An Alphabetical Guide|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DH0vmD8ghdMC&amp;pg=PA388 |year=2010|publisher=Penguin  |isbn=978-0-14-341421-6|pages=388–389}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bhoi2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Bettina Bäumer (Translator)|title=Bhima Bhoi, Verses from the Void: Mystic Poetry of an Oriya Saint|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nNnhSAAACAAJ|year=2010|publisher=Manohar Publishers |isbn=978-81-7304-813-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Vaishnavism]] of [[Orissa, India|Orissa]], the idea of Shunya [[Brahman]] or Shunya [[Purusha]] is found in the poetry of the Orissan [[Oriya literature#Age of the Panchasakhas|Panchasakhas]] (Five Friends), such as in the compositions of 16th-century [[Acyutananda]]. Acyutananda's ''Shunya Samhita'' extols the nature of Shunya Brahman: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
''nāhi tāhāra rūpa varṇa, adṛsha avarṇa tā cinha.''&lt;br /&gt;
''tāhāku brahmā boli kahi, śūnya brahmhati se bolāi.''

It has no shape, no colour, &lt;br /&gt;
It is invisible and without a name&lt;br /&gt;
This Brahman is called Shunya Brahman.&lt;ref&gt;Acyutānanda, ''Brahma Saṃhitā'', translated by Patnaik, p.117&lt;/ref&gt;{{full citation needed|date=January 2017}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The [[Oriya literature#Age of the Panchasakhas|Panchasakhas]] practiced a form of [[Bhakti]] called Jnana-mishrita Bhakti-marga, which saw the necessity of knowledge ([[Jnana]]) and devotion - [[Bhakti]].{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}
