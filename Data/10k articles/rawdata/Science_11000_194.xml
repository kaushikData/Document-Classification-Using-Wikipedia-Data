The '''ASC-15''' (Advance System Controller Model 15) was a [[digital computer]] developed by [[International Business Machines]] (IBM) for use on the [[Titan (rocket family)|Titan II]] intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM).&lt;ref&gt;1958: "IBM develops the ASC-15 guidance computer for the United States Air Force Titan II missile computer. " [http://www-03.ibm.com/ibm/history/exhibits/space/space_chronology.html IBM Archives: Space flight chronology]. See also Bilstein, Stages to Saturn, p. 243. See also Olsen and Orrange, p. 406&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://ed-thelen.org/comp-hist/BRL61-a.html&lt;/ref&gt; It was subsequently modified and used on the [[Titan III]] and [[Saturn I]] Block II launch vehicles.

Its principal function on these rockets was to make navigation calculations using data from [[Inertial measurement unit|inertial sensor systems]]. It also performed readiness checks before launch.&lt;ref&gt;Larson, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; It was a digital serial processor using fixed-point data with 27-bit words. The storage was a [[drum memory]]. Electronic circuits were welded encapsulated modules, consisting of discrete [[resistor]]s, [[transistor]]s, [[capacitor]]s, and other components welded together and encapsulated in a foam material. It was manufactured in the IBM plant at [[Owego (town), New York|Owego]], NY.&lt;ref&gt;Larson, p. 4. See also: Martin H. Weik. "A Third Survey of Domestic Electronic Digital Computing Systems" Ballistic Research Laboratories, Aberdeen Proving Ground, Maryland Report No. 1115, March 1961  http://ed-thelen.org/comp-hist/BRL61-a.html pages 58-59.&lt;/ref&gt;

== ASC-15 for Titan II ==

The first inertial guidance system for the [[LGM-25C Titan II|Titan II]] was built by [[AC Spark Plug]], and included an inertial measurement unit based in designs from [[Draper Labs]] at [[MIT]] and the ASC-15 computer designed and built by IBM in Owego, NY. The first Titan II missile carrying this system was launched 16 March 1962. Acquiring spares for this system became difficult, and the Air Force decided to replace it with a new system. The AC Spark Plug system, including the ASC-15, was replaced by the [[Delco Electronics]] [[Universal Space Guidance System]] (USGS) on operational Titan II missiles starting in January 1978.&lt;ref&gt;David K. Stumpf. Titan II. A History of a Cold War Missile Program. University of Arkansas Press, Fayetteville, Arkansas, 2000. {{ISBN|1-55728-601-9}}. Pages 63-67.&lt;/ref&gt; The guidance computer in the USGS was the [[Magic 352]], made by Delco.&lt;ref&gt;A.C. Liang and D.L. Kleinbub."Navigation of the Titan IIIC space launch vehicle using the Carousel VB IMU." AIAA Guidance and Control Conference, Key Biscayne, FL, 20–22 August 1973. AIAA Paper No. 73-905.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ASC-15 was built on an aluminum frame about 1.5x1.5x1 feet.&lt;ref&gt;Estimate based on mensuration of photographs of the ASC-15 and a volume of {{convert|2.12|cuft|m3}} reported in "Spaceborne Digital Computer Systems," NASA, SP-8070, March 1971.&lt;/ref&gt;  The sides, top and bottom were covered by pieces of laminated plastic, covered with gold-plated aluminum foil. These covers were slightly convex and ribbed for stiffness. Inside the covers were fifty-two logic sticks, each containing four welded encapsulated modules. These surrounded a bell frame housing a drum memory.&lt;ref&gt;"Missile Launch/Missile Officer (LGM-25) Missile Systems." USAF, Sheppard Technical Training Center, May 1967. Student Study Guide OBR1821F/3121f-V-1 thru 4, Volume I of II.&lt;/ref&gt; See Figure 2.

The drum was a thin-walled stainless steel cylinder 3 inches long and 4.5 inches in diameter covered with a magnetic nickel-cobalt alloy. It was driven by a synchronous motor at 6,000 rpm. The drum had 70 tracks, of which 58 were used and 12 were spare. These tracks were used as follows:
{| border="1"
! width="80"|NO. TRACKS 
! width="230"|USE OF TRACKS 
|-
| align="center" | 34 || Instruction tracks
|-
| align="center" | 7 || Constants
|-
| align="center" | 8 || Target data
|-
| align="center" | 2 || Data for temporary storage
|-
| align="center" | 5 || Revolvers for extra fast access storage
|-
| align="center" | 2 || Timing tracks
|}

The capacity of a track was 1,728 bits. Instruction words were 9-bits long, and data was stored in 27-bit words.&lt;ref&gt;A.E. Cooper and W.T. Chow. "Development of On-board Space Computer Systems" IBM Journal of Research and Development, January 1976. Pages 5-18.&lt;/ref&gt;

Coincident with 58 tracks were 67 read heads and 13 write heads. While the drum was spinning at 6,000 rpm, the heads floated above the surface of the drum on a thin layer of air. When the drum was spinning up or slowing down, the heads were raised off the drum by camshafts rotated by a chain that was driven by a motor on top of the drum housing, to avoid scoring the magnetic surface. See Figure 3.

== ASC-15 for Titan III ==

The [[Titan III]] was a space launch vehicle based on the Titan II ICBM. The ASC-15 was kept as the vehicle guidance computer, but the drum was lengthened slightly to provide 78 usable tracks, an increase of 20 over the drum used in the Titan II. The memory held 9,792 instructions (51 tracks) and 1,152 constants (18 tracks). The speed was the same as for the Titan II: 100 revolutions/second × 64 words/revolution × 27 bits/word = 172.8 kilobits/second. The time for an addition operation was 156 [[Microsecond|µs]]; for a multiplication, 1,875 [[Microsecond|µs]]; and for a division, 7,968 [[Microsecond|µs]].&lt;ref&gt;Paul O. Larson. "Titan III Inertial Guidance System". AIAA Paper No. 65-306. AIAA Second Annual Meeting, 26–29 July 1965, San Francisco, CA.&lt;/ref&gt;

== ASC-15 for Saturn I ==

No guidance computer was used for Saturn I Block I (missions SA-1, 2, 3 and 4). The guidance system for SA-2 is shown in Figure 4.&lt;ref&gt;F.W. Brandner. "Technical Information Summary Concerning Saturn Vehicle SA-2.". NASA MSFC Memo dated 5 April 1962. TMX 51831. 16 pages https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19650076118_1965076118.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  The pitch program was provided by a cam device located in the Servo Loop Amplifier Box. The sequence of events was controlled by a program device that was also used on Jupiter missiles. This was a 6-track tape recorder that sent pulses to a set of relays (the flight sequencer) to activate and deactivate various circuits in a precisely timed sequence.

The ASC-15 was first flown on SA-5, the first Saturn I Block II vehicle and the first to achieve orbit.&lt;ref&gt;Saturn Flight Evaluation Working Group. "Results of the Fifth Saturn I Launch Vehicle Test Flight (SA-5)." NASA MSFC 22 September 1964. MPR-SAT-FE-64-17. https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19650060677_1965060677.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt; It was a passenger on this mission, not guiding the vehicle but generating test data for later evaluation. The active guidance system on SA-5 was similar to that of earlier flights. The passenger system was the ASC-15 and the [[ST-124-M3 inertial platform|ST-124 inertial platform]]. Guidance was open loop; that is guidance commands were functions only of time. SA-5 also saw the introduction of the [[Saturn V Instrument Unit|Instrument Unit]].

On SA-6, while open loop ST-90S guidance was used for the first stage (S-I), after separation the ST-124 and ASC-15 used path adaptive guidance (closed loop) to control the second stage (S-IV). The SA-6 guidance system is shown in Figure 5.&lt;ref&gt;Saturn Flight Evaluation Working Group. "Results of the Sixth Saturn I Launch Vehicle Test Flight (SA-6)." NASA MSFC 1 October 1964. MPR-SAT-FE-64-18. https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19700089115_1970089115.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The effectiveness of the path adaptive guidance was demonstrated inadvertently when premature shutdown of S-IV engine number eight had virtually no effect on the vehicle trajectory.

The arrangement of the ST-90S and ST-124 systems (including the ASC-15 guidance computer) on SA-6 is shown in Figure 6.&lt;ref&gt;"Apollo Systems Reliability Status Report. Volume II: Subsystems Reliability Status DRAFT." NASA, Washington, DC,  23 September 1963. 225 pages. https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19750069412_1975069412.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; This is version 1 of the Instrument Unit, which flew on SA-5, 6, and 7.

On SA-7 the ST-124 system guided the firing of both stages. The guidance and control system for SA-7 is shown in Figure 7.&lt;ref&gt;Saturn Flight Evaluation Working Group. "Results of the Seventh Saturn I Launch Vehicle Test Flight (SA-7)." NASA MSFC 30 December 1964. MPR-SAT-FE-64-19. https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19740074283_1974074283.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The digital computer is the ASC-15. It replaced both the cam device that contained the S-I tilt program for earlier missions.&lt;ref&gt;"Saturn I Summary." NASA MSFC, 15 Feb 1966. 43 pages. {{hdl|2060/19660014308}} 
. "Results of the Seventh Saturn I Launch Vehicle Test Flight (SA-7)." PDF page 113.&lt;/ref&gt; and the program device that controlled the sequence of events on those missions.

The next mission flown after SA-7 was SA-9. It carried a new version of the Instrument Unit, one that was unpressurized and {{convert|2|ft|m}} shorter than version 1. Version 2 flew on the remaining Saturn I missions (SA-8, 9, and 10), and is shown under construction at MSFC in Figure 8.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mix.msfc.nasa.gov/IMAGES/HIGH/6412716.jpg |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-12-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110709121113/http://mix.msfc.nasa.gov/IMAGES/HIGH/6412716.jpg |archivedate=2011-07-09 |df= }}. "This image depicts a high angle view of technicians working on the instrument unit (IU) component assembly for the SA-8 mission in Marshall Space Flight Center's building 4705."&lt;/ref&gt; Figure 9 is a blowup of this image, showing the dummy ASC-15 and dummy ST-124.

'''Acidophile''' (or '''acidophil''', or, as an adjectival form, '''acidophilic''') is a term used by [[histologist]]s to describe a particular staining pattern of cells and tissues when using [[haematoxylin]] and [[eosin]] stains. Specifically, the name refers to structures which "love" acid, and take it up readily. More specifically, acidophilia can be described by cationic groups of most often proteins in the cell readily reacting with acidic stains.&lt;ref&gt;Ross MH, Pawlina W. Histology : a text and atlas. 5. ed. Philadelphia, Pa.: Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins; 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

It describes the microscopic appearance of [[cell (biology)|cell]]s and [[Biological tissue|tissue]]s, as seen through a [[microscope]], after a [[histological section]] has been stained with an [[acidic]] [[dye]]. The most common such dye is [[eosin]], which stains acidophilic substances red and is the source of the related term [[eosinophilic]]. Note that a single cell can have both acidophilic substances/organelles and basophilic substances/organelles, albeit some have historically had so much of one stain that the cell itself is called a [[Eosinophil granulocyte|eosinophil]].

'''Anchialus Glacier''' ({{lang-bg|italic=yes|ледник Анхиало}}, 'Lednik Anchialus' \'led-nik an-hi-'a-lo\) is the 8.5&amp;nbsp;km long and 3.4&amp;nbsp;km wide glacier in [[Sostra Heights]] on the east side of northern [[Sentinel Range]] in [[Ellsworth Mountains]], [[Antarctica]].  It is situated north of lower [[Embree Glacier]], east of [[Sabazios Glacier]], south of lower [[Newcomer Glacier]] and northwest of [[Vit Ice Piedmont]].  The glacier drains the northeast slopes of [[Mount Malone]] and the west slopes of [[Bracken Peak]], flows northwards and joins Newcomer Glacier east of [[Mount Lanning]].

The glacier is named after the ancient town of [[Pomorie#Ancient Greek colony and Roman centre|Anchialus]] in Southeastern Bulgaria.

{{About|the test in petroleum manufacturing|the semiconductor manufacturing process|plasma ashing}}

'''Ashing''' is a test to deduce the amount of ash forming material present in a petroleum product so as to decide its use in certain applications. Ash-forming materials are considered to be undesirable impurities or contaminants.

The specimen is placed in a suitable vessel, [[evaporating dish]] or [[crucible]] and ignited. It is allowed to burn until only ash and carbon remains. The carbonaceous residue is reduced to ash by heating in a [[muffle furnace]] at about 775&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;C, cooled and weighed.

Ashing is also performed prior to chemical analysis by [[inductively coupled plasma emission spectrometry]]. Another application is the detection of asbestos content in certain products.

Each monomer "borrows" functions from other nearby components, effectively increasing its basis set and improving the calculation of derived properties such as [[energy]]. If the total energy is minimised as a function of the system geometry, the short-range energies from the mixed basis sets must be compared with the long-range energies from the unmixed sets, and this mismatch introduces an error.  

Other than using infinite basis sets, two methods exist to eliminate the BSSE. In the ''chemical Hamiltonian approach'' (CHA),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1063/1.476931 |first=I. |last=Mayer |author2=Valiron, P. |title=Second order Møller–Plesset perturbation theory without basis set superposition error |journal=[[Journal of Chemical Physics|J.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; the BSSE is calculated by re-performing ''all'' the calculations using the mixed basis sets, and the error is then subtracted ''a posteriori'' from the uncorrected energy.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15544">[[File:Shear Moment Diagram.svg|thumb|400px|[[Shear and moment diagram]] for a simply supported beam with a concentrated load at mid-span.]]
A '''bending moment'''  is the reaction induced in a [[structural element]] when an external [[force]] or [[Moment of force|moment]] is applied to the element causing the element to [[bending|bend]].&lt;ref name=timo/&gt;&lt;ref name=beer/&gt; The most common or simplest structural element subjected to bending moments is the [[Beam (structure)|beam]].  The diagram shows a beam which is simply supported at both ends.  Simply supported means that each end of the beam can rotate; therefore each end support has no bending moment. The ends can only react to the shear loads.  Other beams can have both ends fixed; therefore each end support has both bending moment and shear reaction loads. Beams can also have one end fixed and one end simply supported.  The simplest type of beam is the cantilever, which is fixed at one end and is free at the other end (neither simple or fixed). In reality, beam supports are usually neither absolutely fixed nor absolutely rotating freely.

The internal reaction loads in a [[cross section (geometry)|cross-section]] of the structural element can be resolved into a [[resultant force]] and a resultant [[couple (mechanics)|couple]].  For equilibrium, the moment created by external forces (and external moments) must be balanced by the couple induced by the internal loads.  The resultant internal couple is called the '''bending moment''' while the resultant internal force is called the '''shear force''' (if it is transverse to the plane of element) or the '''normal force''' (if it is along the plane of the element).

The bending moment at a [[cross section (geometry)|section]] through a structural element may be defined as "the sum of the moments about that section of all external forces acting to one side of that section". The forces and moments on either side of the section must be equal in order to counteract each other and maintain a state of [[Dynamic equilibrium|equilibrium]] so the same bending moment will result from summing the moments, regardless of which side of the section is selected. If clockwise bending moments are taken as negative, then a negative bending moment within an element will cause "sagging", and a positive moment will cause "hogging". It is therefore clear that a point of zero bending moment within a [[Beam (structure)|beam]] is a point of [[contraflexure]]&amp;mdash;that is the point of transition from hogging to sagging or vice versa.

Moments and [[torque]]s are measured as a force multiplied by a distance so they have as unit [[newton-metre]]s (N·m), or [[pound-foot (torque)|pound-foot]] (lbf·ft). The concept of bending moment is very important in [[engineering]] (particularly in [[Civil engineering|civil]] and [[mechanical engineering]]) and [[physics]].

== Background ==
[[Tensile]] and [[compressive]] stresses increase proportionally with bending moment, but are also dependent on the [[second moment of area]] of the cross-section of a beam (that is, the shape of the cross-section, such as a circle, square or I-beam being common structural shapes). Failure in bending will occur when the bending moment is sufficient to induce tensile stresses greater than the [[Yield (engineering)|yield]] stress of the material throughout the entire cross-section.  In structural analysis, this bending failure is called a plastic hinge, since the full load carrying ability of the structural element is not reached until the full cross-section is past the yield stress.  It is possible that failure of a structural element in [[Shearing (physics)|shear]] may occur before failure in bending, however the mechanics of failure in shear and in bending are different.

Moments are calculated by multiplying the external [[vector (geometric)|vector]] [[force]]s (loads or reactions) by the vector distance at which they are applied. When analysing an entire element, it is sensible to calculate moments at both ends of the element, at the beginning, centre and end of any uniformly distributed loads, and directly underneath any point loads. Of course any "pin-joints" within a structure allow free rotation, and so zero moment occurs at these points as there is no way of transmitting turning forces from one side to the other.

It is more common to use the convention that a clockwise bending moment to the left of the point under consideration is taken as positive. This then corresponds to the second derivative of a function which, when positive, indicates a curvature that is 'lower at the centre' i.e. sagging. When defining moments and curvatures in this way calculus can be more readily used to find slopes and deflections.

Critical values within the beam are most commonly annotated using a [[Shear and moment diagram|bending moment diagram]], where negative moments are plotted to scale above a horizontal line and positive below. Bending moment varies linearly over unloaded sections, and parabolically over uniformly loaded sections.

Engineering descriptions of the computation of bending moments can be confusing because of unexplained sign conventions and implicit assumptions.  The descriptions below use vector mechanics to compute moments of force and bending moments in an attempt to explain, from first principles, why particular sign conventions are chosen.

== Computing the moment of force ==
[[File:beam moment plain.svg|thumb|300px|Computing the moment of force in a beam.]]
An important part of determining bending moments in practical problems is the computation of moments of force.
Let &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F}&lt;/math&gt; be a force vector acting at a point '''A''' in a body.  The moment of this force about a reference point ('''O''') is defined as&lt;ref name=beer&gt;{{Citation|last=Beer|first=F.|last2=Johnston|first2=E.R.|title=Vector mechanics for engineers: statics|publisher=McGraw Hill|year=1984|pages=62–76}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
:&lt;math&gt;
   \mathbf{M}  = \mathbf{r} \times \mathbf{F}
 &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{M}&lt;/math&gt; is the moment vector and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r}&lt;/math&gt; is the position vector from the reference point ('''O''') to the point of application of the force ('''A''').  The &lt;math&gt;\times&lt;/math&gt; symbol indicates the vector cross product.  For many problems, it is more convenient to compute the moment of force about an axis that passes through the reference point '''O'''.  If the unit vector along the axis is &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{e}&lt;/math&gt;, the moment of force about the axis is defined as
:&lt;math&gt;
   M = \mathbf{e}\cdot\mathbf{M} = \mathbf{e}\cdot(\mathbf{r} \times \mathbf{F})
 &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\cdot&lt;/math&gt; indicates the vector dot product.

===  Example ===
The adjacent figure shows a beam that is acted upon by a force &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;.  If the coordinate system is defined by the three unit vectors &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{e}_x, \mathbf{e}_y, \mathbf{e}_z&lt;/math&gt;, we have the following 
:&lt;math&gt;
   \mathbf{F} = 0\,\mathbf{e}_x - F\,\mathbf{e}_y + 0\,\mathbf{e}_z
   \quad \text{and} \quad \mathbf{r} = x\,\mathbf{e}_x + 0\,\mathbf{e}_y + 0\,\mathbf{e}_z \,.
 &lt;/math&gt;
Therefore,
:&lt;math&gt;
   \mathbf{M} = \mathbf{r}\times\mathbf{F} = \left|\begin{matrix}\mathbf{e}_x &amp;  \mathbf{e}_y &amp;  \mathbf{e}_z \\ x &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; -F &amp; 0 
         \end{matrix}\right| = -Fx\,\mathbf{e}_z \,.
 &lt;/math&gt;
The moment about the axis &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{e}_z&lt;/math&gt; is then
:&lt;math&gt;
   M_z = \mathbf{e}_z\cdot\mathbf{M} = -Fx \,.
 &lt;/math&gt;

=== Sign conventions ===
The negative value suggests that a moment that tends to rotate a body clockwise around an axis should have a '''negative''' sign.  However, the actual sign depends on the choice of the three axes &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{e}_x, \mathbf{e}_y, \mathbf{e}_z&lt;/math&gt;.  For instance, if we choose another right handed coordinate system with &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{E}_x = \mathbf{e}_x, \mathbf{E}_y = -\mathbf{e}_z, \mathbf{E}_z = \mathbf{e}_y&lt;/math&gt;, we have
:&lt;math&gt;
   \mathbf{F} = 0\,\mathbf{E}_x + 0\,\mathbf{E}_y -F\,\mathbf{E}_z
   \quad \text{and} \quad \mathbf{r} = x\,\mathbf{E}_x + 0\,\mathbf{E}_y + 0\,\mathbf{E}_z \,.
 &lt;/math&gt;
Then,
:&lt;math&gt;
   \mathbf{M} = \mathbf{r}\times\mathbf{F} = \left|\begin{matrix}\mathbf{E}_x &amp;  \mathbf{E}_y &amp;  \mathbf{E}_z \\ x &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; -F 
         \end{matrix}\right| = Fx\,\mathbf{E}_y 
   \quad \text{and} \quad M_y = \mathbf{E}_y\cdot\mathbf{M} = Fx \,.
 &lt;/math&gt;
For this new choice of axes, a '''positive''' moment tends to rotate body clockwise around an axis.

== Computing the bending moment ==
In a rigid body or in an unconstrained deformable body, the application of a moment of force causes a pure rotation.  But if a deformable body is constrained, it develops internal forces in response to the external force so that equilibrium is maintained.  An example is shown in the figure below.  These internal forces will cause local deformations in the body.

For equilibrium, the sum of the internal force vectors is equal to the applied external force and the sum of the moment vectors created by the internal forces is equal to the moment of the external force.  The internal force and moment vectors are oriented in such a way that the total force (internal + external) and moment (external + internal) of the system is zero.  The internal moment vector is called the '''bending moment'''.&lt;ref name=timo&gt;{{Citation|last=Gere|first=J.M.|last2=Timoshenko|first2=S.P.|title=Mechanics of Materials:Forth edition|year=1996|publisher=Nelson Engineering|isbn=0534934293}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though bending moments have been used to determine the stress states in arbitrary shaped structures, the physical interpretation of the computed stresses is problematic.  However, physical interpretations of bending moments in beams and plates have a straightforward interpretation as the [[stress resultants]] in a cross-section of the structural element.  For example, in a beam in the figure, the bending moment vector due to stresses in the cross-section ''A'' perpendicular to the ''x''-axis is given by
:&lt;math&gt;
   \mathbf{M}_x = \int_A \mathbf{r} \times (\sigma_{xx} \mathbf{e}_x + \sigma_{xy} \mathbf{e}_y + \sigma_{xz} \mathbf{e}_z)\, dA 
   \quad \text{where} \quad 
    \mathbf{r} = y\,\mathbf{e}_y + z\,\mathbf{e}_z \,.
 &lt;/math&gt; 
Expanding this expression we have,
:&lt;math&gt;
   \mathbf{M}_x = \int_A \left(-y\sigma_{xx}\mathbf{e}_z + y\sigma_{xz}\mathbf{e}_x + z\sigma_{xx}\mathbf{e}_y - z\sigma_{xy}\mathbf{e}_x\right)dA =: M_{xx}\,\mathbf{e}_x + M_{xy}\,\mathbf{e}_y + M_{xz}\,\mathbf{e}_z\,.
 &lt;/math&gt;
We define the bending moment components as 
:&lt;math&gt;
  \begin{bmatrix} M_{xx} \\ M_{xy} \\M_{xz} \end{bmatrix}
    := \int_A \begin{bmatrix} y\sigma_{xz} - z\sigma_{xy} \\ z\sigma_{xx} \\ -y\sigma_{xx} \end{bmatrix}\,dA \,.
 &lt;/math&gt;
The internal moments are computed about an origin that is at the neutral axis of the beam or plate and the integration is through the thickness (&lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt;)

=== Example ===
[[File:beam bending moment plain.svg|thumb|300px|Computing the bending moment in a beam.]]
In the beam shown in the adjacent figure, the external forces are the applied force at point '''A''' (&lt;math&gt;-F\mathbf{e}_y&lt;/math&gt;) and the reactions at the two support points '''O''' and '''B''' (&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{R}_O = R_O\mathbf{e}_y&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{R}_B = R_B\mathbf{e}_y&lt;/math&gt;).  The reactions can be computed using balances of forces and moments about point '''A''', i.e.,
:&lt;math&gt;
    R_O + R_B - F = 0 \quad \text{and} \quad -\mathbf{r}_A\times\mathbf{R}_O + \mathbf{r}_B\times\mathbf{R}_B = \mathbf{0} \,.
 &lt;/math&gt;
If &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; is the length of the beam, we have
:&lt;math&gt;
    \mathbf{r}_A = x_A\mathbf{e}_x \quad \text{and} \quad \mathbf{r}_B = (L-x_A)\mathbf{e}_x \,.
 &lt;/math&gt;
If we solve for the reactions we have
:&lt;math&gt;
   R_O = \left(1 - \frac{x_A}{L}\right) F \quad \text{and} \quad R_B = \frac{x_A}{L}\,F \,.
 &lt;/math&gt;
Looking at the free body diagram of the part of the beam to the left of point '''X''', the total moment of the external forces about the point '''X''' is
:&lt;math&gt;
   \mathbf{M} = -(\mathbf{r}_X-\mathbf{r}_A)\times\mathbf{F} - \mathbf{r}_X\times\mathbf{R}_O = 
         \left[(x_A-x)\mathbf{e}_x\right]\times\left(-F\mathbf{e}_y\right)
         - \left(x\mathbf{e}_x\right)\times\left(R_O\mathbf{e}_y\right) \,.
&lt;/math&gt;
If we compute the cross products, we have
:&lt;math&gt;
  \mathbf{M} 
       = \left|\begin{matrix}\mathbf{e}_x &amp; \mathbf{e}_y &amp; \mathbf{e}_z \\ x_A - x &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; -F &amp; 0 \end{matrix}\right| -
         \left|\begin{matrix}\mathbf{e}_x &amp; \mathbf{e}_y &amp; \mathbf{e}_z \\ x &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; R_0 &amp; 0 \end{matrix}\right|
       = F(x-x_A)\,\mathbf{e}_z -R_0x\,\mathbf{e}_z = -\frac{F x_A}{L}(L-x)\,\mathbf{e}_z \,.
 &lt;/math&gt;
For this situation, the only non-zero component of the bending moment is
:&lt;math&gt;
    \mathbf{M}_{xz} = -\left[\int_z\int_{-h/2}^{h/2} y\,\sigma_{xx}\,dy\,dz\right]\mathbf{e}_z \,.
 &lt;/math&gt;
For the sum of the moments at '''X''' about the axis &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{e}_z&lt;/math&gt; to be zero, we require
:&lt;math&gt;
   \mathbf{M} + \mathbf{M}_{xz} = \mathbf{0} \quad \text{or} \quad -\frac{F x_A}{L}(L-x) + M_{xz} = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad M_{xz} =\frac{F x_A}{L}(L-x)  \,.
 &lt;/math&gt;
At &lt;math&gt;x = x_A&lt;/math&gt;, we have &lt;math&gt;M_{xz} = Fx_A(L-x_A)/L&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Sign convention ===
In the above discussion, it is implicitly assumed that the bending moment is positive when the top of the beam is compressed.  That can be seen if we consider a linear distribution of stress in the beam and find the resulting bending moment.  Let the top of the beam be in compression with a stress &lt;math&gt;-\sigma_0&lt;/math&gt; and let the bottom of the beam have a stress &lt;math&gt;\sigma_0&lt;/math&gt;.  Then the stress distribution in the beam is &lt;math&gt;\sigma_{xx}(y) = -y\sigma_0&lt;/math&gt;.  The bending moment due to these stresses is
:&lt;math&gt;
   M_{xz} = -\left[\int_z\int_{-h/2}^{h/2} y\,(-y\sigma_0)\,dy\,dz\right] = \sigma_0\,I
 &lt;/math&gt; 
where &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; is the [[area moment of inertia]] of the cross-section of the beam.   Therefore the bending moment is positive when the top of the beam is in compression.

Many authors follow a different convention in which the stress resultant &lt;math&gt;M_{xz}&lt;/math&gt; is defined as
:&lt;math&gt;
    \mathbf{M}_{xz} = \left[\int_z\int_{-h/2}^{h/2} y\,\sigma_{xx}\,dy\,dz\right]\mathbf{e}_z \,.
 &lt;/math&gt;
In that case, positive bending moments imply that the top of the beam is in tension.  Of course, the definition of '''top''' depends on the coordinate system being used.  In the examples above, the top is the location with the largest &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;-coordinate.

'''Body memory''' (BM) is a [[hypothesis]] that the body itself is capable of storing memories, as opposed to only the brain. While experiments have demonstrated the possibility of cellular memory{{R|"cosier"}} there are currently no known means by which tissues other than the brain would be capable of storing memories.{{R|"Smith"}}{{R|"Lilienfeld"}}

Modern usage of BM tends to frame it exclusively in the context of traumatic memory and ways in which the body responds to recall of a memory. In this regard, it has become relevant in treatment for [[PTSD]].{{R|"M.D.2014"}}

== Overview ==

Peter Levine calls BM ''[[implicit memory]]'' or more specifically [[procedural memory]], things that the body is capable of doing automatically and not in one's consciousness. He clarifies 3 types of BM and frames his work in terms of [[traumatic memory]] consequence and resolution:{{R|"levine"}}
#Learned motor actions - Action patterns that can be continuously modified over time by higher brain regions.
#Emergency response - Hardwired instinctual behaviors (i.e., fight or flight response, etc...).
#Attraction or repulsion - We are attracted to sources of nourishment and growth and repulsed from sources of injury or toxicity.

Nicola Diamond elaborates on the opinion of philosopher [[Merleau Ponty|Merleau-Ponty]] and asserts that BM is formed by doing. Whether practicing a bodily activity or forming a reaction to a traumatic memory.{{R|"Diamond2013"}}

Edward Casey speaks of BM as, "memory intrinsic to the body, how we remember by and through the body", rather than what is remembered about the body.{{R|"Casey2009"}}

Thomas Fuchs defines 6 different types of BM: procedural, situational, intercorporeal, incorporative, pain, and traumatic memory. He notes that they are not strictly separable from one another but "derived from different dimensions of bodily experience.{{R|"KochFuchs2012"}}{{RP|12}} Michelle Summa further refines this definition as an implicit memory. A pre-thematic, operative consciousness of the past expressed through the body.{{R|"KochFuchs2012"}}{{RP|30}}

[[Antonio Damasio]] calls these reactions to memories ''somatic markers'' or emotions that are expressed primarily as physical feelings.{{R|"Ansermet2018"}}

These memories are often associated with [[phantom pain]] in a part or parts of the body – the body appearing to remember the past trauma.  The idea of body memory is a belief frequently associated with the idea of [[repressed memories]], in which memories of incest or sexual abuse can be retained and recovered through physical sensations.{{R|"Smith"}} It may also be associated with phantom limb sensation but this is less common.{{R|"price"}}

=== Skepticism ===

In 1993, Susan E. Smith, presented a paper relating the idea of "Survivor Psychology" at a [[false memory syndrome]] [[Academic conference|conference]], stated about BM that, "body memories are thought to literally be emotional, kinesthetic, or chemical recordings stored at the cellular level and retrievable by returning to or recreating the chemical, emotional, or kinesthetic conditions under which the memory recordings are filed.{{R|"Smith"}} She went on in the abstract of the paper, "one of the most commonly used theories to support the ideology of [[repressed memories]] or incest and sexual abuse amnesia is body memories." and "The belief in these pseudoscientific concepts appears to be related to [[Scientific literacy|scientific illiteracy]], gullibility, and a lack of critical thinking skills and reasoning abilities in both the mental health community and in society at large"{{R|"Smith"}}

A 2017 systematic review of cross-disciplinary research in body memory found that the available data neither largely support or refute the claim that memories are stored outside of the brain and more research is needed.{{R|"riva"}}

In the ''Encyclopedia of Phenomenology'' Embree notes that, "To posit body memory is to open up a [[Pandora's Box]]", and links the idea to physical associations of memory rather than as a memory stored in a bodily manner.{{R|"Embree2013"}}

== Cellular memory ==

Cellular memory (CM) is a parallel hypothesis to BM positing that memories can be stored outside the brain in all cells.{{R|"skepdic"}} The idea that non-brain tissues can have memories is believed by some who have received [[organ transplantation|organ transplants]], though this is considered impossible. The author said the stories are intriguing though and may lead to some serious scientific investigation in the future.{{R|"skepdic"}} In his book ''TransplantNation'' Douglas Vincent suggests that atypical newfound memories, thoughts, emotions and preferences after an organ transplant are more suggestive of [[immunosuppressant drugs]] and the stress of surgery on perception than of legitimate memory transference. In other words, "as imaginary as a bad trip on [[LSD]] or other [[psychotropic drug]]."{{R|"vincent"}}

=== Flatworms ===

Biologists at [[Tufts University]] have been able to train [[flatworms]] despite the loss of the brain and head. This may show memory stored in other parts of the body in some animals.{{R|"planaria"}} A worm reduced to 1/279th of the original can be regrown within a few weeks and be trained much quicker to head towards light and open space for food, an unnatural behavior for a flatworm. With each head removed training times appear reduced. This may just be a sign of [[epigenetics]] showing the appearance of memory.{{R|"anthony"}}

However, in the 1950s and 1960s [[James V. McConnell|James McConnell]] flatworm experiments measured how long it took to learn a maze. McConnell trained some to move around a maze and then chopped them up and fed them to untrained worms. The untrained group learned faster compared to a control that had not been fed trained worms. McConnell believed the experiment indicated cellular memory.{{R|"Hood"}} The training involved stressing the worms with electric shock. This kind of stress releases persistent [[hormones]] and shows no evidence for memory transfer. Similar experiments with mice being trained and being fed to untrained mice showed improved learning. It was not a memory that was transferred but hormone enriched tissue.{{R|"Hood"}}

=== Current usage and research ===
{{See Also|Epigenetics|Immune memory}}

In epigenetics there are various mechanisms for cells to pass on "memories" of stressors to their progeny. Strategies include Msn2 nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttling, changes in chromatin, partitioning of anti-stress factors, and damaged [[macromolecules]] between mother and daughter cells.{{R|"pmid29846762"}}

In [[adaptive immunity]] there is a functional CM that enables he immune system to learn to react to pathogens through mechanisms such as, cytoxic memory mediation in [[bone marrow]],{{R|"pmid15978522"}}, innate immune memory in [[stromal cells]],{{R|"pmid29729109"}}, [[fungal]] mediation of innate and inherited [[immunological]] response,{{R|"pmid29842944"}} and T and B-cell immune training.{{R|"rosenblum"}} In this regard CM is essential for [[vaccine]] and [[Immunity (medical)|immunity]] research.

'''BugGuide''' (or '''BugGuide.net''') is a [[website]] and [[online community]] of [[Natural history|naturalists]], both amateur and professional, who share observations of [[insect]]s, [[spider]]s, and other related creatures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.desmoinesregister.com/article/20110731/LIFE/307310010/-1/GETPUBLISHED03/Discovering-bugs-her-passion|title=Discovering bugs and her passion|work=[[The Des Moines Register]]|date=July 31, 2011|accessdate=15 August 2011}}{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The website consists of informational guide pages and many thousands of photographs of [[arthropod]]s from the [[United States]] and [[Canada]] which are used for identification and research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=McCullough|first=Corinne|author2=Worthington|first2=Cakey|author3=Paradise|first3=Christopher J.|date=|title=Using Digital Macrophotography to Measure Biodiversity, Identify Insects, and Enhance Outreach and Education|url=https://academic.oup.com/ae/article/59/3/176/6825|journal=American Entomologist|publication-date=Fall 2013|volume=59|issue=3|pages=176–182|doi=10.1093/ae/59.3.176|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The non-commercial site is hosted by the [[Iowa State University]] Department of Entomology. BugGuide was conceived by photographer Troy Bartlett in 2003 and since 2006 has been maintained by Dr. John VanDyk, Adjunct Assistant Professor of Entomology and Senior Systems Analyst at Iowa State University.&lt;ref name="vanDyk1"&gt;[https://bugguide.net/user/view/612 "John VanDyk's Contributor Page"] on BugGuide.Net.&lt;/ref&gt; The website has been recognized for helping change public perception of insects.&lt;ref name="WebWatch"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ahern|first=Kevin|date=|title=WebWatch – Done Buggy|url=https://www.future-science.com/doi/pdf/10.2144/000113266|journal=[[BioTechniques]]|publication-date=November 2009|volume=47|issue=5|page=909|pages=|doi=10.2144/000113266|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to VanDyk, BugGuide had over 809 million hits in 2010, averaging approximately 26 hits per second.&lt;ref name="VD_IOWA"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.inside.iastate.edu/pdf/11/020311.pdf|title=Five questions for John VanDyk|last=Pounds|first=Diana|date=3 February 2011|website=|publisher=Inside Iowa State|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=5 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also stated that in early 2011 the site consisted of almost 34,000 written pages representing about 23 percent of the estimated insect species in North America.&lt;ref name=VD_IOWA/&gt; In April 2012 the guide surpassed 500,000 photos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ent.iastate.edu/bugguide_half_million|title=BugGuide passes the half million mark|last=|first=|date=May 2012|website=|publisher=[[Iowa State University]], Department of Entomology|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120501194706/http://www.ent.iastate.edu/bugguide_half_million|archivedate=1 May 2012|deadurl=yes|accessdate=2 May 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; By October 2014, BugGuide had 30,774 species pages and 48,572 total pages, with over 808,718 images submitted by more than 27,846 contributors.&lt;ref name="BG_Stats"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://bugguide.net/node/view/11181|title=System Statistics|last=|first=|date=6 October 2014|website=BugGuide|publisher=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=6 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 22 September 2014, BugGuide surpassed 1,000,000 pages (most of which are photographs).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://bugguide.net/node/view/1000000|title=longhorned beetle - ''Stenocorus vittiger''|last=|first=|date=|work=BugGuide|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=7 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The photographs posted have contributed to or resulted in several scientific publications.

Geologist and moth collector Richard Wilson said of the site, "The BugGuide site is very useful for anyone finding an insect and it is very interactive on getting it identified if a picture can be taken."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.opb.org/article/the_moth_man_of_bay_center/|title=The Moth Man of Bay Center|last=Gable|first=Cate|date=19 July 2011|website=|publisher=[[Oregon Public Broadcasting]]|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=15 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to gardening author Margaret Roach, "The site is where naturalists of all levels share photos of 'insects, spiders and their kin' to foster enthusiasm and expand the knowledge base about these often-overlooked (and as BugGuide points out, 'oft-maligned') creatures."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://awaytogarden.com/why-im-abuzz-about-bugguide-net|title=why i'm abuzz about bugguide.net|author=Roach|first=Margaret|date=20 September 2012|work=A Way to Garden|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=13 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the site itself, BugGuide.net has been responsible for the identification of 11 new, previously undescribed species as of mid-2014. In addition, 12 species new to the Western Hemisphere were first identified via the site; another seven new to North America; and numerous new country records (primarily the United States) and state/county sightings.&lt;ref name="newrecords"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://bugguide.net/node/view/504744|title=Bug Guide firsts list for Latin American Bug Guide project|last=|first=|date=|website=BugGuide|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=6 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dr '''Charles Edward Foister''' [[FRSE]] (1903–1989) was a British botanist and plant pathologist. He was Director of Scottish Agricultural Scientific Services in Edinburgh from 1957. He specialised in lichens and fungi.&lt;ref&gt;http://kiki.huh.harvard.edu/databases/botanist_search.php?mode=details&amp;id=82603&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
He was born in [[Cambridge]] in [[England]] on 17 August 1903, the son of Frederick W Foister and his wife Esther Elizabeth Smith.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.geni.com/people/Charles-Foister/6000000036410965267&lt;/ref&gt; He was educated locally and won a place at [[Cambridge University]] graduating BA in 1925. He continued as a postgraduate taking a Diploma in Agricultural Science (1927). He later received a doctorate (PhD) from [[Edinburgh University]].

He was employed as a plant pathologist in eastern Edinburgh for all of his working life. He became the official plant pathologist for Britain in 1938.&lt;ref&gt;The London Gazette 8 April 1938&lt;/ref&gt; He was an active member of the Botanical Society of Edinburgh.

In 1954 he was elected a Fellow of the [[Royal Society of Edinburgh]].

'''Clinical professor''', also known as '''professor of practice''', is an [[Academic rank|academic appointment]] made to a member of a profession who is associated with a [[university]] and engages in practical instruction of [[professional student]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mcg.edu/faculty/facman/fadpt/clinicaladjunct.html CLINICAL AND ADJUNCT FACULTY APPOINTMENT POLICY] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101213071737/http://www.mcg.edu/faculty/facman/fadpt/clinicaladjunct.html |date=December 13, 2010 }}, [[Medical College of Georgia]] Faculty Manual. October 26, 2004.  &lt;/ref&gt; Titles in this category may include Clinical Instructor, Assistant Clinical Professor, Associate Clinical Professor, and Clinical Professor.&lt;ref name = "ucla" /&gt; Clinical professorship generally does not offer a "[[tenure track]]", but can be either full or part-time, and is typically noted for its emphasis on practical skills training as opposed to theoretical matters. Thus, most members of such faculty are expected to have considerable practical experience in their respective fields of expertise; unlike with most other faculty, this is deemed at least as important as educational credentials.&lt;ref name = "ucla"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.apo.ucla.edu/policies-forms/the-call/professorial-series/clinical-professor-series-volunteer-series|title=Clinical professor series: Volunteer series|work=UCLA Academic Personnel Office|accessdate=10 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; For administrative purposes, some universities classify such a designation as equivalent to "[[adjunct professor]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ap.ucsb.edu/policies.and.procedures/red.binder/sections/%5B5_20%5D%20Professor%20of%20Practice.pdf|title=Professor of Practice|work=University of California, Santa Barbara|accessdate=10 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clinical professors may be salaried or may teach as a volunteer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bu.edu/handbook/appointments-and-promotions/classification-of-ranks-and-titles/|title=Classification of Ranks and Titles|work=Faculty Handbook|publisher=Boston University|accessdate=10 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the field of medicine, full clinical professors generally work full time at the medical college and its affiliated hospitals, while assistant clinical professors are part time with their full practice elsewhere, with little involvement in medical education; the assistant clinical professor position may be almost entirely honorary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=What Makes A “Top” Doctor |url=http://www.castleconnolly.com/AmExPDFs/ATopDoctor.pdf |publisher=Castle Connolly |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180703233751/http://www.castleconnolly.com/AmExPDFs/ATopDoctor.pdf |archivedate=3 July 2018 |pages=8-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=M.L.B.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5829">'''Cosmopolitan democracy''' is a political theory which explores the application of norms and values of [[democracy]] at the transnational and global sphere. It argues that [[global governance]] of the people, by the people, for the people is possible and needed. Writers advocating cosmopolitan democracy include [[Immanuel Kant]],&lt;ref&gt;Immanuel Kant, [http://www.constitution.org/kant/perpeace.htm ''Immanuel Kant, To perpetual peace: a philosophical sketch''], Hackett Publishing, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; [[David Held]],&lt;ref&gt;Daniele Archibugi &amp; David Held, eds., [http://www.polity.co.uk/book.asp?ref=9780745613819  ''Cosmopolitan Democracy. An Agenda for a New World Order''], Polity Press, Cambridge, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.polity.co.uk/book.asp?ref=9780745600567 David Held, ''Democracy and the Global Order''], Polity Press, Cambridge, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; [[Daniele Archibugi]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Daniele Archibugi]], [http://press.princeton.edu/titles/8737.html  ''The Global Commonwealth of Citizens. Toward Cosmopolitan Democracy''], [[Princeton University Press]], Princeton, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; [[Richard Falk]],&lt;ref&gt;Richard Falk, ''On Humane Governance'', Polity Press, Cambridge, 1998&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Mary Kaldor]].&lt;ref&gt;Mary Kaldor, ''New and Old Wars'', Polity Press, Cambridge, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;
In the cosmopolitan democracy model, decisions are made by those affected, avoiding a single hierarchical form of authority. According to the nature of the issues at stake, democratic practice should be reinvented to take into account the will of stakeholders. This can be done either through direct participation or through elected representatives.&lt;ref&gt;Daniele Archibugi, [http://www.danielearchibugi.org/downloads/papers/Principles Principles of Cosmopolitan Democracy].&lt;/ref&gt; The model advocated by cosmopolitan democrats is confederal and decentralized—[[global governance]] without [[world government]]—unlike those models of global governance supported by classic [[World Federalism]] thinkers, such as [[Albert Einstein]].

==Origin and development==

The victory of [[liberal democracies#Liberal democracies around the world|Western liberal states]] ending the [[Cold War]] inspired the hope that [[international relations]] could be guided by the ideals of [[democracy]] and the [[rule of law]]. In the early 1990s, a group of thinkers developed the political project of cosmopolitan democracy with the aim of providing intellectual arguments in favour of an expansion of democracy, both within states and at the global level. While some significant successes have been achieved in terms of democratization within states, much less has been attained in democratizing the global system.

In different forms, the necessity to expand democratic procedures beyond the nation-state has been supported by political philosopher [[Jürgen Habermas]],&lt;ref&gt;Jürgen Habermas, ''The Post-National Constellation'', MIT Press, Cambridge, MA, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;  and sociologist [[Ulrich Beck]].&lt;ref&gt;Ulrich Beck, ''World Risk Society'', Polity Press, Cambridge, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

Criticisms of cosmopolitan democracy have come from [[political realism|realist]], [[marxist]], [[communitarian]] and [[multicultural]] perspectives. Democratic theorist [[Robert Dahl]]&lt;ref&gt;Robert Dahl, Can International Organizations be Democratic?, in Ian Shapiro and Casiano Hacker-Cordón (eds) (1999) ''Democracy’s Edges''. New York: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; has expressed his doubts about the possibility of expanding democracy in international organizations to any significant degree, as he believes that democracy diminishes with size. Opponents of Dahl's approach point to the fact that bigger countries are not necessarily less democratic. For example, there is no correlation between voters' turnout and population size; in fact it is smallest in countries with fewer than 100,000 citizens. {{Citation needed|date=November 2015}}

==Political programme==
The idea of cosmopolitan democracy has been advocated with reference to the reform of international organizations. This includes the institution of the [[International Criminal Court]], a directly elected [[World Parliament]] or world assembly of governments, and more widely the democratization of [[international organizations]].&lt;ref&gt;For an attempt to identify the political forces acting in favour of cosmopolitan democracy and the issues to be addressed, see [[Daniele Archibugi]] and [[David Held]], [http://www.danielearchibugi.org/downloads/papers/Archibugi_Held_CD%20Paths%20and%20Ways.pdf Cosmopolitan Democracy: Paths and Agents] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203000857/http://www.danielearchibugi.org/downloads/papers/Archibugi_Held_CD%20Paths%20and%20Ways.pdf |date=2013-12-03 }}, ''Ethics &amp; International Affairs'', 25, no. 4 (2011), pp. 433-461.&lt;/ref&gt; Supporters of cosmopolitan democracy have been sceptical about the effectiveness of military interventions, even when they are apparently motivated by [[Humanitarian intervention|humanitarian intentions]]. They have instead suggested popular [[diplomacy]] and [[arms control]].

'''Cultural cringe''', in [[cultural studies]] and [[social anthropology]], is an internalized [[inferiority complex]] that causes people in a country to dismiss their own culture as inferior to the cultures of other countries.  It is closely related to the concept of [[colonial mentality]] and is often linked with the display of [[Anti-Intellectualism|anti-intellectual attitudes]] towards thinkers, scientists, and artists who originate from a colonial or [[post-colonial]] nation.  It can also be manifested in individuals in the form of cultural alienation. 

== Origin ==
In 1894, Australian [[bush poetry|bush poet]]  [[Henry Lawson]] wrote in his preface to his ''Short Stories in Prose and Verse'':
{{quote|The Australian writer, until he gets a "[[London]] hearing," is only accepted as an imitator of some recognized English or American author; and, as soon as he shows signs of coming to the front, he is labelled "The Australian [[Robert Southey|Southey]]," "The Australian [[Robert Burns|Burns]]," or "The Australian [[Bret Harte]]," and lately, "The Australian [[Rudyard Kipling|Kipling]]." Thus no matter how original he may be, he is branded, at the very start, as a plagiarist, and by his own country, which thinks, no doubt, that it is paying him a compliment and encouraging him, while it is really doing him a cruel and an almost irreparable injury. But mark! As soon as the Southern writer goes "home" and gets some recognition in England, he is "So-and-So, the well-known Australian author whose work has attracted so much attention in London lately"; and we first hear of him by cable, even though he might have been writing at his best for ten years in Australia.&lt;ref&gt;Colin Rodrick (ed.) Henry Lawson, Autobiographical and Other Writings 1887–1922 ([[Angus &amp; Robertson]], 1972) pp.108–109&lt;/ref&gt;}} 

The term "cultural cringe" was coined in [[Australia]] after the Second World War by the [[Melbourne]] critic and social commentator [[A. A. Phillips]], and defined in an influential and highly controversial 1950 essay of the same name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Phillips | first = Arthur Angel | authorlink = A. A. Phillips | title = On the Cultural Cringe | publisher = [[Melbourne University Publishing]] | url = https://www.mup.com.au/items/9780522852219 |date=December 2005 | isbn = 0-522-85221-1  }}&lt;/ref&gt; It explored ingrained feelings of inferiority that local intellectuals struggled against, and which were most clearly pronounced in the Australian theatre, music, art and letters. The implications of these insights potentially applied to all former colonial nations, and the essay is now recognised as a cornerstone in the development of [[Post-colonialism|post-colonial theory]] in Australia. In essence, Phillips pointed out that the public widely assumed that anything produced by local dramatists, actors, musicians, artists and writers was necessarily deficient when compared against the works of their British and European counterparts.  In the words of the poet [[Chris Wallace-Crabbe]] (quoted by [[Peter Conrad (academic)|Peter Conrad]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Expatriate Games | url = http://www.theage.com.au/news/National/Expatriate-games/2005/03/24/1111525276948.html | publisher = ''[[The Age]]'' | date = 2005-03-25 | accessdate = 2007-01-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;), Australia was being made to rhyme with failure.  The only ways local arts professionals could build themselves up in public esteem was either to follow overseas fashions, or, more often, to spend a period of time working in Britain.&lt;ref name="When London Calls"&gt;{{cite book | last = Alomes | first = Stephen | authorlink = | title = When London Calls: The Expatriation of Australian Creative Artists to Britain | publisher = Cambridge University Press | year = 1999 | location = Melbourne | url =  | isbn = 0-521-62031-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Once an Australian"&gt;{{cite book | last = Britain | first = Ian | authorlink = | title = Once an Australian: Journeys with Barry Humphries, Clive James, Germaine Greer and Robert Hughes | publisher = Oxford University Press | year = 1997 | location = Melbourne | url =  | isbn = 0-19-553742-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As Lawson continued in his 1894 preface: "The same paltry spirit tried to dispose of the greatest of modern short-story writers as 'The Californian Dickens', but America wasn't built that way – neither was Bret Harte!" The cultural cringe of Australians and the cultural swagger of Americans reflects deep contrasts between the American and the Australian experiences of extricating themselves from English apron-strings.  Dealing specifically with Australia, Phillips pointed out that ''sport'' has been the only field in which ordinary people accepted that their nation was able to perform and excel internationally.  Indeed, while they prided themselves on the qualities of locally produced athletes and sportsmen, whom they invariably considered first rate, Australians behaved as if in more intellectual pursuits the nation generated only second-rate talent.  Some commentators believe that cultural cringe contribute to the perceived [[anti-intellectualism]] that has underpinned public life in Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Anti-Intellectualism in Australia | url = http://www.abc.net.au/rn/talks/austback/stories/s198653.htm | publisher = [[Radio National]] | date = 2000-10-05 | accessdate = 2007-01-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Connection with cultural alienation==
The cultural cringe is tightly connected with "cultural alienation", that is, the process of devaluing or abandoning one's own culture or cultural background.  A person who is culturally alienated places little value on their own or host culture, and instead hungers for that of a&amp;nbsp;– sometimes imposed&amp;nbsp;– colonising nation.&lt;ref name="Empire Writes Back"&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Culturally alienated societies often exhibit a weak sense of cultural self-identity and place little worth on themselves.  It has been argued that the most common manifestation of this alienation among peoples from post-colonial nations at present is an appetite for all things American, from television and music, to clothing, slang, even names. However, the popularity of American culture across both formerly colonized and colonizer countries possibly negate this argument. Culturally alienated individuals will also exhibit little knowledge or interest in the history of their host society, placing no real value on such matters.&lt;ref name="Empire Writes Back" /&gt;

The issue of cultural alienation has led the Australian sociologists [[Brian Head (sociologist)|Brian Head]] and [[James Walter (sociologist)|James Walter]] to interpret the cultural cringe as the belief that one's own country occupies a "subordinate cultural place on the periphery" and that "intellectual standards are set and innovations occur elsewhere."&lt;ref name="another_look"&gt;{{cite book

  | isbn = 0-949769-89-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As a consequence, a person who holds this belief is inclined to devalue their own country's cultural, academic and artistic life, and to venerate the "superior" culture of another (colonising) country.

A more sophisticated approach to the issues raised by the cultural cringe, as felt by artistic practitioners in former colonies around the world, was developed and advanced by the Australian art historian [[Terry Smith (art historian)|Terry Smith]] in his essay 'The Provincialism Problem'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

==By country==

===Australia===
[[File:Tom Wills carte de visite.jpg|thumb|It has been posited that Australia's "distinct ambivalence" towards its own history, coupled with a desire to rid the country of its "convict stain", resulted in historical figures such as star cricketer and Australian rules football founder [[Tom Wills]] being virtually forgotten.&lt;ref&gt;[[Gideon Haigh|Haigh, Gideon]] (2009). "Foreword". In Russell H. T., Stephens. ''Wills Way''. Playright Publishing. p. i. {{ISBN|9780977522682}}.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The term cultural cringe is most commonly used in Australia, where it is believed by some to be a fact of Australian cultural life.&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth Minogue. "[http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1282/is_n25_v47/ai_17774503 Cultural Cringe: Cultural Inferiority Complex and Republicanism in Australia]". ''[[National Review]]''. 31 December 1995. Retrieved 5 September 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;
In ''Another Look at the Cultural Cringe'',&lt;ref name="another_look"/&gt; the Australian academic Leonard John Hume examined the idea of cultural cringe as an oversimplification of the complexities of Australian history and culture. His controversial essay argues that "The cultural cringe ... did not exist, but it was needed, and so it was invented."

The cultural cringe can be expressed in the almost obsessive curiosity of Australians to know what foreigners think of Australia and its culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2007/07/10/1974488.htm |title=Getting over Australia's Cultural Cringe |publisher=Abc.net.au |date=2007-07-10 |accessdate=2009-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some commentators claim the cultural cringe particularly affects local television programming in Australia,&lt;ref&gt;Tony Moore. "[http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2004/08/18/1092765013665.html Cultural Cringe Keeps our History out of the Picture]". ''[[Sydney Morning Herald]]''. 19 August 2004. Retrieved 1 January 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; which is heavily influenced by imported shows, mainly of American and British origin.  The Federal government has legislated to keep a quota of Australian content (Australian Content Standard and Television Program Standard 23).

Some argue that a form of cultural cringe resulted in anti-heritage attitudes which led to the demolition of many world class pre-war buildings in [[Melbourne]], [[Brisbane]] and [[Sydney]], destroying some of the world's best examples of [[Victorian architecture]].&lt;ref&gt;Simon Webster. "[http://www.theage.com.au/news/new-south-wales/construction-sights/2006/07/07/1152240479493.html Construction Sights]". ''[[The Age]]''. 9 July 2006. Retrieved 1 January 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;  Modernism was promoted to many Australians as casting off imperial Europe to rebuild a new independent identity, and the existing pre-war architecture, which was a feature of Australian cities, was denigrated.&lt;ref&gt;Blow S – The Marketing of modernism in Melbourne, 1950–1970&lt;/ref&gt;  This resulted in many calls to demolish the [[Royal Exhibition Building]], labelled the derogatory term "[[white elephant]]".  It was not until [[Queen Elizabeth II]] granted the building Royal status that Australians began to recognise its value.  The building became the first in Australia to be given [[World Heritage]] status.&lt;ref&gt;Guy Rundle. "[http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2004/03/14/1079199092582.html?from=storyrhs Who will save Melbourne from the wrecker's ball?]". ''[[the Age]]''. 15 March 2004. Retrieved 1 January 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;  This reaction against the cultural cringe continues in some fields such as architecture, where local architects are shunned for using introduced styles.&lt;ref&gt;Gabriella Coslovich. "[http://www.theage.com.au/news/national/kicking-against-the-bricks/2006/01/28/1138319484198.html Kicking against the bricks]". Interview with Leon van Schaik. ''[[The Age]]''. 29 January 2006.  Retrieved 1 January 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

It has also been claimed that cultural cringe has led to federal government [[information technology]] contracts going to large foreign multinationals, rather than domestic IT companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crn.com.au/story.aspx?CIID=57787 |title=An unlevel playing field |author=Lilia Guan |publisher=Crn.com.au |date=2006-08-04 |accessdate=2009-11-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061003152633/http://www.crn.com.au/story.aspx?CIID=57787 |archivedate=3 October 2006 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another manifestation of cultural cringe is the "[[convict stain]]". For several generations following the cessation of [[penal transportation]], many Australians felt a sense of shame about being descended from convicts, and many did not even attempt to investigate their families' origins for fear of finding convicts in their lineage. In recent decades community attitudes have changed, and many Australians with convict ancestors are now more comfortable investigating and discussing their past, wearing their forebears status almost as a badge of pride. Colloquially, attempts by non-Australians to negatively connote convict pasts are laughed off by Australians, who are now more inclined to associate criminal forebears as evidence for the possession of more positively perceived Australian attributes such as [[anti-authoritarianism]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/rn/latenightlive/stories/2008/2209906.htm The convict stain]  Australian Broadcasting Corporation.  Late Night Live.  8 April 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Brazil ===
In [[Brazil]], the phrase ''complexo de vira-lata'' (the "[[Mongrel complex]]") denotes the same as cultural cringe. It was allegedly coined by playwright and journalist, [[Nelson Rodrigues]], in the 1950s. The term is often evoked to criticize some attitude by any Brazilian toward a foreign culture or politics deemed as submissive and self-dismissive.

=== Canada ===
Many cultural commentators in Canada&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.theknoll.ca/php/display.php?article_id=69&amp;PHPSESSID=97ac8552e6e52cf977456d08cabf357f An 'Un-American' Cinema] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070319171932/http://www.theknoll.ca/php/display.php?article_id=69&amp;PHPSESSID=1f4b9ceb8a82a0181ba56d7f7f97e467 |date=19 March 2007 }}", The Knoll. Retrieved 5 September 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; have suggested that a similar process also operates in that country. The specific phrase "cultural cringe" is not widely used to label the phenomenon in Canada, although it has been used in isolated instances; more typically, Canadian cultural commentators speak of a "Canadian inferiority complex"&lt;ref&gt;Merrill Dennison. [http://www.empireclubfoundation.com/details.asp?SpeechID=2782 That Inferiority Complex] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061113072738/http://www.empireclubfoundation.com/details.asp?SpeechID=2782 |date=13 November 2006 }} (address to The Empire Club).&lt;/ref&gt; or label specific instances of the phenomenon with satirical terms such as "[[beaver hour]]".

Prior to the 1970s, Canadian radio stations gave almost no airtime to Canadian music, and apart from [[CBC Television]], Canadian television stations spent very little money on Canadian-produced programming; in response the [[Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission]] (CRTC) developed [[Canadian content]] requirements for radio and broadcasters. Whether these 'Cancon' rules are necessary remains controversial.

===New Zealand===
New Zealanders are said to suffer from a cultural cringe, which has been wearing off in recent years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The TV show ''[[Flight of the Conchords (TV series)|Flight of the Conchords]]'', which screened on [[HBO]] in the United States from 2007–2009, furthered American and international awareness of New Zealand, as have motion pictures such as ''[[The World's Fastest Indian]]''.

=== Scotland ===
Scottish First Minister [[Jack McConnell]] claimed a "[[Scottish cringe]]" in relation to [[Scotland]]'s disdain for free enterprise.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/3494686.stm "I want to end the Scottish cringe"], BBC News, 28 February 2004. Retrieved 10 June 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Dimensional metrology''' is the science of calibrating and using physical measurement equipment to quantify the physical size of or distance from any given object.

== History of metrology ==
Early Mesopotamian and Egyptian [[metrologist]]s created a set of measurement standards based on body measures such as fingers, palms, hands, feet, [[Cubit]]s, and paces and agricultural measures such as feet, yards, paces, fathoms, rods, cords, perch, stadia, miles and degrees of the Earth's circumference. Early Egyptian rulers based on units of fingers, palms and feet based on inscription grids that incorporated standards of measure as canons of proportion were made commensurate with Mesopotamian standards based on fingers, hands and feet so that four palms or three hands equaled one foot and ten hands equaled one meter. These standards which were used to measure and define property such as buildings and fields were adopted by the Greeks, Romans and Persians as legal standards and became the basis of European standards of measure. They were also used to relate length to area with units such as the khet, setat and aroura, area to volume with units such as the artaba and space to time with units such as the Egyptian minute of march, the itrw which recorded an hours travel on a river, and the days sail. Specialized units for carpenters, masons and other craftsmen such as the remen were worked into a system of unit fractions that allowed calculations utilizing analytic geometry. Carpenters and surveyors were some of the first dimensional inspectors.

== Tools  ==
Modern measurement equipment include hand tools, CMMs ([[coordinate-measuring machine]]s), machine vision systems, laser trackers, and optical comparators. For hand tools, see [[Gauge (instrument)|gauge]]. A CMM is based on [[CNC]] technology to automate measurement of Cartesian coordinates using a touch probe, contact scanning probe, or non-contact sensor. Optical comparators are used when physically touching the part is undesirable. Instruments can now build 3D models of a part and its internal passages using x-ray technology or 3D laser scanners.

== Relative measurement ==
Measurements are often expressed as a size relative to a theoretically perfect part that has geometry defined in a print or computer model. A print is a blueprint illustrating the defined geometry of a part and its features. Each feature can have a size, a distance from other features, and a tolerance set on each element. The international language used to describe physical parts is called [[Geometric dimensioning and tolerancing|GD&amp;T]]. Prints can be hand drawn or automatically generated by a computer [[CAD model]]. Computer controlled measurement systems can measure a part relative to a CAD model without the need for a print.

==Mechanical engineering==
Industrial metrology is common in manufacturing quality control systems. The prints and CAD models described above are usually made by a [[mechanical engineer]].

'''Emanoil Bacaloglu''' ({{IPA-ro|emanoˈil bakaˈloɡlu}}; 11 April 1830 – 30 August 1891) was a [[Wallachia]]n and [[Romania]]n [[mathematician]], [[physicist]] and [[chemist]] and a scubadiver, medic, shoe salesman, a vegetarian,policeman and fireman.

Born in [[Bucharest]] and of [[Greeks of Romania|Greek]] origin, he studied physics and mathematics in [[Paris]] and [[Leipzig]], later becoming a professor at the [[University of Bucharest]] and, in 1879, a [[list of members of the Romanian Academy|member of the Romanian Academy]]. Considered to be the founder of many scientific and technological fields in Romania (and aiding in the creation of the [[Romanian Athenaeum]]), Bacaloglu was also an accomplished scientist. He helped create Romanian-language terminology in his fields and was one of the principal founders of the Society of Physical Sciences in 1890.

He was also a participant in the [[1848 Wallachian revolution]].

He is known for the "Bacaloglu [[pseudosphere]]".  This is a [[surface of revolution]] for which the "Bacaloglu [[curvature]]" is constant.

[[File:Electron density wave - plasmon excitations.png|thumb|350px |Schematic representation of a surface wave propagating along a metal-dielectric interface. The fields away from the surface die off exponentially (right hand graph) and those fields are thus described as ''evanescent'' in the '''z''' direction]]
In electromagnetics, an '''evanescent field''', or  '''evanescent wave''', is an oscillating electric and/or magnetic field that  does not propagate as an [[electromagnetic wave]] but whose energy is spatially concentrated in the vicinity of the source (oscillating charges and currents). Even when there in fact is an electromagnetic wave produced (e.g., by a transmitting [[Antenna (radio)|antenna]]) one can still identify as an evanescent field the component of the electric or magnetic field that cannot be attributed to the propagating wave observed at a distance of many wavelengths (such as the [[far field]] of a transmitting antenna).

A hallmark of an evanescent field is that there is no net energy flow in that region. Since the net flow of electromagnetic energy is given by the average [[Poynting vector]], that means that the Poynting vector in these regions, as averaged over a complete oscillation cycle, is zero.&lt;ref group=note&gt;or expressing the fields '''E''' and '''H''' as phasors, the complex Poynting vector &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{S} = \mathbf{E} \times \mathbf{H^*}&lt;/math&gt; has a zero real part&lt;/ref&gt;

== Usage of the term ==
{{Refimprove section|date=October 2017}}
In many cases one cannot simply say that a field is or is not evanescent. For instance,  in the above illustration energy is indeed transmitted in the horizontal direction. The field strength drops off exponentially away from the surface, leaving it concentrated in a region very close to the interface, for which reason this is referred to as a [[surface wave]]. However, there is ''no'' propagation of energy ''away'' from (or toward) the surface (in the '''z''' direction), so that one could properly describe the field as being "evanescent in the z direction." This is one illustration of the inexactness of the term. In most cases where they exist, evanescent fields are simply thought of and referred to as electric or magnetic fields, without the evanescent property (zero average Poynting vector in one or all directions) ever being pointed out. The term is especially applied to differentiate a field or solution from cases where one normally expects a propagating wave.

Everyday electronic devices and electrical appliances are surrounded by large fields which have this property. Their operation involves alternating voltages (producing an electric field between them) and alternating currents (producing a magnetic field around them). The term "evanescent" is never heard in this ordinary context. Rather, there may be concern with inadvertent production of a propagating electromagnetic wave and thus discussion of reducing [[Alternating current#Techniques for reducing radiation loss|radiation losses]] (since the propagating wave steals power from the circuitry) or interference. On the other hand, "evanescent field" is used in various contexts where there ''is'' a propagating (even if confined) electromagnetic wave involved, to describe accompanying electromagnetic components which do not have that property. Or in some cases where there would ''normally'' be an electromagnetic wave (such as light [[refracted]] at the interface between glass and air) the term is invoked to describe the field when that wave is suppressed (such as with light in glass incident on an air interface beyond the [[critical angle (optics)|critical angle]]).

Although all electromagnetic fields are classically governed according to [[Maxwell's equations]], different technologies or problems have certain types of expected solutions, and when the primary solutions involve wave propagation the term "evanescent" is frequently applied to field components or solutions which do not share that property. For instance, the [[propagation constant]] of a hollow metal [[waveguide]] is a strong function of frequency (a so-called [[dispersion relation]]). Below a certain frequency (the [[Cutoff frequency|cut-off frequency]]) the propagation constant becomes an imaginary number. A solution to the [[wave equation]] having an imaginary wavenumber does ''not'' propagate as a wave but falls off exponentially, so the field excited at that lower frequency is considered evanescent. It can also be simply said that propagation is "disallowed" for that frequency. The formal solution to the wave equation can describe modes having an identical form, but the change of the propagation constant from real to imaginary as the frequency drops below the cut-off frequency totally changes the physical nature of the result. One can describe the solution then as a "cut-off mode" or an "evanescent mode";&lt;ref name=IEEEDict_1992&gt;{{cite book|title=IEEE Standard Dictionary of Electrical and Electronics Terms|date=1992|publisher=The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, Inc.|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-1-55937-240-4|page=458|edition=IEEE STD 100-1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;  while a different author will just state that no such mode exists. Since the evanescent field corresponding to the mode was computed as a solution to the wave equation, it is often discussed as being an "evanescent wave" even though its properties (such as not carrying energy) are inconsistent with the definition of [[wave]].

Although this article concentrates on electromagnetics, the term ''evanescent'' is used similarly in fields such as [[acoustics]] and [[quantum mechanics]] where the [[wave equation]] arises from the physics involved. In these cases, solutions to the wave equation resulting in imaginary propagation constants are likewise termed "evanescent" and have the essential property that no net energy is transmitted even though there is a non-zero field.

== Evanescent wave applications ==
In [[optics]] and [[acoustics]], evanescent waves are formed when waves traveling in a medium undergo [[total internal reflection]] at its boundary because they strike it at an angle greater than the so-called ''[[critical angle (optics)|critical angle]]''.&lt;ref name=Tineke&gt;{{Cite journal|title=A Bright Future for Subwavelength Light Sources|author=Tineke Thio|volume=94|issue=1|pages=40–47|year=2006|doi=10.1511/2006.1.40|journal=American Scientist}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Marstin-acoustic&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Marston | first =Philip L. | authorlink = |author2=Matula, T.J. | title =Scattering of acoustic evanescent waves | journal = [[Journal of the Acoustical Society of America]] | volume =111 | issue =5 | page =2378 | date =May 2002 | bibcode =2002ASAJ..111.2378M | doi=10.1121/1.4778056 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The physical explanation for the existence of the evanescent wave is that the electric and magnetic fields (or [[pressure gradients]], in the case of acoustical waves) cannot be discontinuous at a boundary, as would be the case if there was no evanescent wave field. In [[quantum mechanics]], the physical explanation is exactly analogous—the [[wave function|Schrödinger wave-function]] representing particle motion normal to the boundary cannot be discontinuous at the boundary.

Electromagnetic evanescent waves have been used to exert optical [[radiation pressure]] on small particles to trap them for experimentation, or to [[refrigeration|cool]] them to very low temperatures, and to illuminate very small objects such as [[biological cell]]s or [[Single-molecule experiment|single protein and DNA molecules]] for [[microscopy]] (as in the [[total internal reflection fluorescence microscope]]). The evanescent wave from an [[optical fiber]] can be used in a gas sensor, and evanescent waves figure in the [[infrared spectroscopy]] technique known as [[attenuated total reflectance]].

In [[electrical engineering]], evanescent waves are found in the [[Electromagnetic radiation#Near and far fields|near-field region]] within one third of a wavelength of any radio antenna. During normal operation, an antenna emits electromagnetic fields into the surrounding nearfield region, and a portion of the field energy is reabsorbed, while the remainder is radiated as EM waves.

Recently, a graphene-based Bragg grating (one-dimensional [[photonic crystal]]) has been fabricated and demonstrated its competence for excitation of surface electromagnetic waves in the periodic structure using a [[Prism coupler|prism coupling technique]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Excitation of surface electromagnetic waves in a graphene-based Bragg grating |journal=Scientific Reports |year=2012|doi=10.1038/srep00737 |volume=2|pages=737 |last1=Sreekanth|first1=Kandammathe Valiyaveedu|last2=Zeng|first2=Shuwen|last3=Shang|first3=Jingzhi|last4=Yong|first4=Ken-Tye|last5=Yu|first5=Ting |bibcode = 2012NatSR...2E.737S |pmid=23071901 |pmc=3471096}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[quantum mechanics]], the evanescent-wave solutions of the [[Schrödinger equation]] give rise to the phenomenon of [[quantum tunnelling|wave-mechanical tunneling]].

In [[microscopy]], systems that capture the information contained in evanescent waves can be used to create [[super-resolution microscopy|super-resolution images]]. Matter radiates both propagating and evanescent electromagnetic waves. Conventional optical systems capture only the information in the propagating waves and hence are subject to the [[Diffraction-limited system|diffraction limit]]. Systems that capture the information contained in evanescent waves, such as the [[superlens]] and [[near field scanning optical microscopy]], can overcome the diffraction limit; however these systems are then limited by the system's ability to accurately capture the evanescent waves.&lt;ref&gt;Neice, A., "Methods and Limitations of Subwavelength Imaging", Advances in Imaging and Electron Physics, Vol. 163, July 2010&lt;/ref&gt;  The limitation on their resolution is given by
: &lt;math&gt; k \propto \frac{1}{d} \ln{\frac{1}{\delta}}&lt;/math&gt;,

where &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; is the maximum [[wave vector]] that can be resolved, &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; is the distance between the object and the sensor, and &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt; is a measure of the [[Q factor|quality]] of the sensor.

More generally, practical applications of evanescent waves can be classified as (1) those in which the energy associated with the wave is used to excite some other phenomenon within the region of space where the original traveling wave becomes evanescent (for example, as in the [[total internal reflection fluorescence microscope]]) or (2) those in which the evanescent wave couples two media in which traveling waves are allowed, and hence permits the transfer of energy or a particle between the media (depending on the wave equation in use), even though no traveling-wave solutions are allowed in the region of space between the two media. An example of this is so-called ''[[quantum tunnelling|wave-mechanical tunnelling]]'', and is known generally as ''[[evanescent wave coupling]]''.

== Total internal reflection of light ==
[[File:Total internal reflection.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Total internal reflection]]]]
[[File:Evanescent wave.jpg|thumb|200px |Top to bottom: representation of a [[refraction|refracted incident wave]] and an evanescent wave at an interface.]]

For example, consider [[total internal reflection]] in two dimensions, with the interface between the media lying on the x axis, the [[surface normal|normal]] along y, and the [[Polarization (waves)|polarization]] along z. One might naively expect that for angles leading to total internal reflection, the solution would consist of an incident wave and a reflected wave, with no transmitted wave at all, but there is no such solution that obeys [[Maxwell's equations]]. Maxwell's equations in a dielectric medium impose a boundary condition of continuity for the components of the fields ''E&lt;sub&gt;||&lt;/sub&gt;, H&lt;sub&gt;||&lt;/sub&gt;, D&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;'', and ''B&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;''. For the polarization considered in this example, the conditions on ''E&lt;sub&gt;||&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''B&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;'' are satisfied if the reflected wave has the same amplitude as the incident one, because these components of the incident and reflected waves superimpose destructively. Their ''H&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;'' components, however, superimpose constructively, so there can be no solution without a non-vanishing transmitted wave. The transmitted wave cannot, however, be a sinusoidal wave, since it would then transport energy away from the boundary, but since the incident and reflected waves have equal energy, this would violate [[conservation of energy]]. We therefore conclude that the transmitted wave must be a non-vanishing solution to Maxwell's equations that is not a traveling wave, and the only such solutions in a dielectric are those that decay exponentially: evanescent waves.

Mathematically, evanescent waves can be characterized by a [[wave vector]] where one or more of the vector's components has an [[imaginary number|imaginary]] value. Because the vector has imaginary components, it may have a magnitude that is less than its real components. If the angle of incidence exceeds the critical angle, then the wave vector of the transmitted wave has the form
:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{k} \ = \ k_y \hat{\mathbf{y}} + k_x \hat{\mathbf{x}}
\ = \ i \alpha \hat{\mathbf{y}} + \beta \hat{\mathbf{x}}, &lt;/math&gt;
which represents an evanescent wave because the ''y'' component is imaginary. (Here α and β are real and ''i'' represents the [[imaginary unit]].)

For example, if the [[Polarization (waves)|polarization]] is perpendicular to the plane of incidence, then the electric field of any of the waves (incident, reflected, or transmitted) can be expressed as

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{E}(\mathbf{r},t) = \mathrm{Re} \left \{ E(\mathbf{r}) e^{ i \omega t } \right \} \mathbf{\hat{z}} &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle\mathbf{\hat{z}}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[unit vector]] in the ''z'' direction.

Substituting the evanescent form of the wave vector '''k''' (as given above), we find for the transmitted wave:

:&lt;math&gt; E(\mathbf{r})  =  E_o e^{-i ( i \alpha y + \beta x ) }  =  E_o e^{\alpha y - i \beta x } &lt;/math&gt;

where α is the [[Propagation constant#Attenuation constant|attenuation constant]] and β is the [[phase constant]].

== Evanescent-wave coupling ==
[[File:FITR penetration depth.svg|thumb|Plot of 1/e-penetration depth of the evanescent wave against angle of incidence in units of wavelength for different refraction indices.]]
Especially in [[optics]], ''evanescent-wave coupling'' refers to the coupling between two waves due to physical overlap of what would otherwise be described as the evanescent fields corresponding to the propagating waves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Size dependence of Au NP-enhanced surface plasmon resonance based on differential phase measurement |journal=Sensors and Actuators B: Chemical |year=2013|doi=10.1016/j.snb.2012.09.073|volume=176|pages=1128|last1=Zeng|first1=Shuwen|last2=Yu|first2=Xia|last3=Law|first3=Wing-Cheung|last4=Zhang|first4=Yating|last5=Hu|first5=Rui|last6=Dinh|first6=Xuan-Quyen|last7=Ho|first7=Ho-Pui|last8=Yong|first8=Ken-Tye |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/268225952_Fig._S1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One classical example is [[frustrated total internal reflection]] in which the evanescent field very close (see graph) to the surface of a dense medium at which a wave normally undergoes [[total internal reflection]] overlaps another dense medium in the vicinity. This disrupts the totality of the reflection, diverting some power into the second medium.

Coupling between two [[optical waveguide]]s may be effected by placing the fiber cores close together so that the evanescent field generated by one element excites a wave in the other fiber. This is used to produce [[fiber optic splitter]]s and in [[fiber tapping]]. At radio (and even optical) frequencies, such a device is called a [[Power dividers and directional couplers#Directional couplers|directional coupler.]] The device is usually called a power divider in the case of microwave transmission and modulation.
Evanescent-wave coupling is synonymous with [[near and far field|near field]] interaction in electromagnetic field theory.  Depending on the nature of the source element, the evanescent field involved is either predominantly electric (capacitive) or magnetic (inductive), unlike (propagating) waves in the far field where these components are connected (identical phase, in the ratio of the [[impedance of free space]]).  The evanescent wave coupling takes place in the non-radiative field near each medium and as such is always associated with matter; i.e., with the induced currents and charges within a partially reflecting surface. Other commonplace examples are the coupling between the primary and secondary coils of a transformer, or between the two plates of a capacitor. In quantum mechanics the wave function interaction may be discussed in terms of particles and described as [[quantum tunneling]].

=== Applications ===
Evanescent wave coupling is commonly used in photonic and nanophotonic devices as waveguide sensors or couplers (see e.g., [[prism coupler]]).

Evanescent wave coupling is used to excite, for example, [[dielectric microsphere resonators]].

A typical application is [[resonant inductive coupling|resonant energy transfer]], useful, for instance, for charging electronic gadgets without wires. A particular implementation of this is [[WiTricity]]; the same idea is also used in some [[Tesla coil]]s.

Evanescent coupling, as near field interaction, is one of the concerns in [[electromagnetic compatibility]].

Coupling of optical fibers without loss for [[fiber tapping]].

Evanescent wave coupling plays a major role in the theoretical explanation of [[extraordinary optical transmission]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.optcom.2008.07.077|title=Critical process of extraordinary optical transmission through periodic subwavelength hole array: Hole-assisted evanescent-field coupling|year=2008|last1=Fan|first1=Zhiyuan|last2=Zhan|first2=Li|last3=Hu|first3=Xiao|last4=Xia|first4=Yuxing|journal=Optics Communications|volume=281|issue=21|pages=5467|bibcode = 2008OptCo.281.5467F }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''foot-and-mouth disease virus''' ('''FMDV''') is the [[pathogen]] that causes [[foot-and-mouth disease]].&lt;ref name="pmid15858032"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Carrillo C, Tulman ER, Delhon G |title=Comparative Genomics of Foot-and-Mouth Disease Virus |journal=J.

The disease, which causes vesicles (blisters) in the mouth and feet of [[bovid]]s, suids, ovids, caprids and other [[cloven-hoof]]ed animals is highly infectious and a major plague of [[animal farming]].

The virus particle (25-30&amp;nbsp;nm) has an [[icosahedral]] [[capsid]] made of [[protein]], without [[virus envelope|envelope]], containing a single strand of [[ribonucleic acid]] ([[RNA]]) containing a positive encoding of its [[genome]].  When the virus comes in contact with the [[cell membrane|membrane]] of a host cell, it binds to a [[membrane receptor|receptor site]] and triggers a folding-in of the membrane.  Once the virus is inside the host cell, the capsid dissolves, and the RNA gets replicated, and translated into viral proteins by the cell's [[ribosome]]s using a cap-independent mechanism driven by the [[internal ribosome entry site]] element.

The synthesis of viral proteins include 2A 'cleavage' during translation.  They include [[proteases]] that inhibit the synthesis of normal cell proteins, and other proteins that interact with different components of the host cell.  The infected cell ends up producing large quantities of viral RNA and capsid proteins, which are assembled to form new viruses.  After assembly, the host cell [[lysis|lyses]] (bursts) and releases the new viruses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapterurl=http://www.horizonpress.com/hsp/abs/absavir.html|vauthors=Martinez-Salas E, Saiz M, Sobrino F|year=2008|chapter=Foot-and-Mouth Disease Virus|title=Animal Viruses: Molecular Biology|publisher=Caister Academic Press|pages=1–38|isbn=978-1-904455-22-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The foot-and-mouth disease virus occurs in seven major [[serovar|serotype]]s: O, A, C, SAT-1, SAT-2, SAT-3, and Asia-1. These serotypes show some regionality, and the O serotype is most common.

A '''gas slug''' is a conglomerate of [[Partial pressure|high pressure]] gas bubbles that forms within certain [[volcano]]es, the agittation of which is a key driving factor in [[Strombolian eruption]]s. They start out as small bubbles of [[gas]] inside of volcanic [[magma]]. These accumulate into one large bubble, which starts to rise through the [[Magma chamber|lava plume]].  Once this accumulated slug reaches the top of the column and comes in contact with air, it bursts with a loud pop&lt;ref name="hvw-strom"&gt;{{cite web|title=How Volcanoes Work: Strombolian Eruptions|url=http://www.geology.sdsu.edu/how_volcanoes_work/Strombolian.html|publisher=[[San Diego State University]]|accessdate=29 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; because of the lower [[air pressure]], throwing magma into the air in the typical lava arc of a Strombolian eruption. This type of eruption is episodic, non-damaging to its source vent, and one of the slowest forms of activity, with the ability to sustain itself for thousands of years.&lt;ref name="ut-strom"&gt;{{cite web|last=Cain|first=Fraser|title=Strombolian Eruption|url=http://www.universetoday.com/29645/strombolian-eruption/|publisher=[[Universe Today]]|accessdate=30 July 2010|date=22 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the effect of gas slugs in lava is well understood, how they form is not well understood, but recent research suggests that they can form as deep as {{convert|3|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} under the surface.&lt;ref name="sci-strom"&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Mike Burton, Patrick Allard, Filippo Muré, Alessandro La Spina|title=Magmatic Gas Composition Reveals the Source Depth of Slug-Driven Strombolian Explosive Activity|journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]]|year=2007|volume=317|issue=5835|pages=227–230|doi=10.1126/science.1141900|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/317/5835/227|accessdate=30 July 2010|publisher=[[American Association for the Advancement of Science]]|issn=1095-9203|bibcode = 2007Sci...317..227B|pmid=17626881}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hoelite''' is a [[mineral]], discovered in 1922 at Mt. Pyramide, [[Spitsbergen]], Norway and named after Norwegian geologist [[Adolf Hoel]] (1879–1964). Its chemical formula is C&lt;sub&gt;14&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ([[9,10-anthraquinone]]).&lt;ref name=HBM/&gt;

It is a very rare [[organic mineral]] which occurs in [[coal fire]] environments in association with [[sal ammoniac]] and [[native sulfur]].&lt;ref name=HBM/&gt;

The '''ISCB Africa ASBCB Conference on Bioinformatics''' is a biennial [[academic conference]] on the subjects of [[bioinformatics]] and [[computational biology]], organized by the [[African Society for Bioinformatics and Computational Biology]] (ASBCB). The conference was first held in 2007 as the "ASBCB Conference on the Bioinformatics of African Pathogens, Hosts and Vectors". Since 2009, the conference has been jointly organized with the [[International Society for Computational Biology]] (ISCB) and held in different locations within Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=p56-57_ASBCB_Intl_Innovation_Issue_Research_Media.pdf|url=http://www.internationalinnovation.com/build/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/p56-57_ASBCB_Intl_Innovation_Issue_Research_Media.pdf|accessdate=30 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although having an evident African focus, the meeting is intended to be a truly international event, encompassing scientists and students from leading institutions in the US, Latin America, Europe and Africa. Holding this event in Africa, ISCB and ASBCB intend to promote local efforts for cooperation and dissemination of leading research techniques to combat major African diseases.

== Format of the Meeting==
The meeting usually consists of a 3-day conference followed by practical workshops. The main 3-day meeting includes keynote presentations by up to 6 invited speakers from around
the world, including Africa. Session Chairs introduce Keynote Speakers with an overview of the session, highlighting the most significant challenges and the current state of the art in the
field before the keynote speakers launch their presentations. Highly accomplished researchers, primarily but not exclusively from non-African countries, present during the post conference tutorial workshops.

==Conference Goals==
* To directly impact existing capacity to develop public health interventions in endemic Africa countries by driving collaboration and networks development and training.
* To expose and educate young and established scientists to the latest bioinformatics tools and techniques used in researching treatments and cures for African hosts, vectors and disease.

==Scientific publications==
Since 2009, the ISCB Africa ASBCB Conference has been partnering with the [[Genes, Infection and Evolution]] journal to publish top papers presented at the conference.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3537">'''Interactional justice''' is defined by sociologist [[John R. Schermerhorn]] as the "...degree to which the people affected by decision are treated by dignity and respect.'' ( John R. Schermerhorn, [[Organizational behavior]])  The theory focuses on the interpersonal treatment people receive when procedures are implemented.

Interactional justice, a subcomponent of [[organizational justice]], has come to be seen as consisting of two specific types of interpersonal treatment (e.g. Greenberg, 1990a, 1993b). The first labeled interpersonal justice, reflects the degree to which people are treated with politeness, dignity, and respect by authorities or third parties involved in executing procedures or determining outcomes. The second, labeled informational justice, focuses on the explanations provided to people that convey information about why procedures were used in a certain way or why outcomes were distributed in a certain fashion.  Where more adequacy of explanation is prevalent, the perceived level of informational justice is higher. (Sam Fricchione 2006).

==Within an organization==
It is important that a high degree of interactional justice exists in a subordinate/supervisor relationship in order to reduce the likelihood of [[counterproductive work behavior]].  If a subordinate perceives that interactional injustice exists, then the subordinate will hold feelings of resentment toward either the supervisor or institution and will therefore seek to "even the score".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=17227160|year=2007|last1=Aryee|first1=S|last2=Chen|first2=ZX|last3=Sun|first3=LY|last4=Debrah|first4=YA|title=Antecedents and outcomes of abusive supervision: Test of a trickle-down model|volume=92|issue=1|pages=191–201|doi=10.1037/0021-9010.92.1.191|journal=The Journal of Applied Psychology}}&lt;/ref&gt; A victim of interaction injustice will have increased expressions of hostility toward the offender which can manifest in actions of counterproductive work behavior and reduce the effectiveness of [[organizational communication]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1002/(SICI)1098-2337(1996)22:3&lt;161::AID-AB1&gt;3.0.CO;2-Q|title=Workplace violence and workplace aggression: Evidence on their relative frequency and potential causes|year=1996|last1=Baron|first1=Robert A.|last2=Neuman|first2=Joel H.|journal=Aggressive Behavior|volume=22|issue=3|pages=161–173}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Abuse directed toward a subordinate from a supervisor often stems from displaced aggression.  In this case, the individual (supervisor) is unwilling to retaliate against the direct source of mistreatment and will therefore abuse a less threatening target such as a subordinate since the subordinate is incapable of retaliation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=10794373|year=2000|last1=Marcus-Newhall|first1=A|last2=Pedersen|first2=WC|last3=Carlson|first3=M|last4=Miller|first4=N|title=Displaced aggression is alive and well: A meta-analytic review|volume=78|issue=4|pages=670–89|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.78.4.670}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, interactional injustice can essentially trickle-down from the top of an organization to the bottom due to displaced aggression that exists in the top ranks of the hierarchy.

The '''Kyoto Prize in Advanced Technology''' is awarded once a year by the [[Inamori Foundation]]. The Prizeis one of three [[Kyoto Prize]] categories; the others are the [[Kyoto Prize in Basic Sciences]] and the [[Kyoto Prize in Arts and Philosophy]]. The first Kyoto Prize in Advanced Technology was awarded to [[Rudolf E. Kálmán]], the "creator of modern control and system theory".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rudolf Emil Kalman|url=http://www.kyotoprize.org/en/laureates/rudolf_emil_kalman/|publisher=Inamori Foundation|accessdate=17 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Prize is widely regarded as the most prestigious award available in fields which are traditionally not honored with a [[Nobel Prize]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Kyoto Prize honors achievement and character|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/tech/science/columnist/vergano/2006-11-12-kyoto-prize_x.htm|publisher=USA Today|accessdate=1 January 2013|date=11 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=John Cahn to Receive 2011 Kyoto Prize For Fundamental Contributions to Materials Science|url=https://www.nist.gov/public_affairs/releases/kyoto-prize-062411.cfm|publisher=National Institute of Standards and Technology|accessdate=1 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the mathematical theory of probability, '''David Lewis's triviality result''' is a theorem about the impossibility of systematically equating the conditional probability &lt;math&gt;P(B\mid A)&lt;/math&gt; with the probability of a so-called conditional event, &lt;math&gt;A \rightarrow B&lt;/math&gt;.

==Conditional probability and conditional events==

[[File:Venn diagram of events A and B and the conditional event If A then B.png|thumb|upright=1.8|Fig. 1 – A diagram of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;A \rightarrow B&lt;/math&gt;.]]

The statement "The probability that if &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;, is 20%" means (put intuitively) that event &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; may be expected to occur in 20% of the outcomes where event &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; occurs. The standard formal expression of this is &lt;math&gt;P(B\mid A)=0.20&lt;/math&gt;, where the [[conditional probability]] &lt;math&gt;P(B\mid A)&lt;/math&gt; equals, by definition, &lt;math&gt;P(A \cap B)/P(A)&lt;/math&gt;.

Beginning in the 1960s, several philosophical logicians—most notably  Ernest Adams and [[Robert Stalnaker]]—floated the idea that one might also write &lt;math&gt;P(A \rightarrow B) = 0.20&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;A \rightarrow B&lt;/math&gt; is the conditional event "If &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;".&lt;ref group=Note&gt;Hájek and Hall (1994) give a historical summary. The debate was actually framed as being about the probabilities of conditional ''sentences'', rather than conditional events. However, this is merely a difference of idiom, so long as sentences are taken to express propositions and propositions are thought of as sets of possible worlds.&lt;/ref&gt; That is, given events &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;, one might suppose there is an event, &lt;math&gt;A \rightarrow B&lt;/math&gt;, such that &lt;math&gt;P(A \rightarrow B)&lt;/math&gt; could be counted on to equal &lt;math&gt;P(B\mid A)&lt;/math&gt;, so long as &lt;math&gt;P(A) &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;.

Part of the appeal of this move would be the possibility of embedding conditional expressions within more complex constructions. One could write, say, &lt;math&gt;P(A \cup (B \rightarrow C)) = 0.75&lt;/math&gt;, to express someone's high subjective degree of confidence ("75% sure") that either &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;, or else if &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt;. Compound expressions containing conditional expressions might also be useful in the programming of automated decision-making systems.&lt;ref group=Note&gt;Reading "If &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;" as "Not &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;, unless also &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;" makes compounding straightforward, since &lt;math&gt;A \rightarrow B&lt;/math&gt; becomes equivalent to the Boolean expression &lt;math&gt;A' \cup B&lt;/math&gt;. However, this has the unsatisfactory consequence that &lt;math&gt;P(A \rightarrow B) \geq P(A')&lt;/math&gt;; then "If &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;" is assigned high probability whenever &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is highly unlikely, even if &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;'s occurrence would make &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; highly &lt;i&gt;un&lt;/i&gt;likely. This is a version of what in logic is called a [[Paradoxes of material implication|paradox of material implication]].&lt;/ref&gt;

How might such a convention be combined with standard probability theory? The most direct extension of the standard theory would be to treat &lt;math&gt;A \rightarrow B&lt;/math&gt; as an event like any other, i.e., as a set of outcomes. Adding &lt;math&gt;A \rightarrow B&lt;/math&gt; to the familiar [[Venn diagram|Venn]]- or [[Euler diagram]] of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; would then result in something like Fig. 1, where &lt;math&gt;s,t,\ldots, z&lt;/math&gt; are probabilities allocated to the eight respective regions, such that &lt;math&gt;s + t + \cdots + z = 1&lt;/math&gt;. 

For &lt;math&gt;P(A \rightarrow B)&lt;/math&gt; to equal &lt;math&gt;P(B\mid A)&lt;/math&gt; requires that &lt;math&gt;t + v + w + y = (s + t)/(s + t + x + y)&lt;/math&gt;, i.e., that the probability inside the &lt;math&gt;A \rightarrow B&lt;/math&gt; region equal the &lt;math&gt;A \cap B&lt;/math&gt; region's proportional share of the probability inside the &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; region. In general the equality will of course not be true, so that making it reliably true requires a new constraint on probability functions: in addition to satisfying Kolmogorov's [[probability axioms]], they must also satisfy a new constraint, namely that &lt;math&gt;P(A \rightarrow B) = P(B\mid A)&lt;/math&gt; for any events &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;P(A) &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;.

==Lewis's result==

Firing what van Fraassen (1976) called "a veritable bombshell" at the above proposal, Lewis (1976) pointed out a seemingly fatal problem: assuming a nontrivial set of events, the new, restricted class of &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;-functions will not be closed under [[Conditional_probability#Conditioning_on_an_event|conditioning]], the operation that turns probability function &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; into new function &lt;math&gt;P_C (\cdot) = P(\cdot\mid C)&lt;/math&gt;, predicated on event &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt;'s occurrence. That is, if &lt;math&gt;P(A \rightarrow B) = P(B\mid A)&lt;/math&gt;, it will not in general be true that &lt;math&gt;P_C(A \rightarrow B) = P_C(B\mid A)&lt;/math&gt; as long as &lt;math&gt;P(C)&gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;. This implies that if rationality requires having a well-behaved probability function, then a fully rational person (or computing system) would become irrational simply in virtue of learning that arbitrary event &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; had occurred.

Lewis's proof is as follows. Let a set of events be non-trivial if it contains two possible events, &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;, that are mutually exclusive but do not together exhaust all possibilities, so that &lt;math&gt;P(A) &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;P(B) &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;P(A \cap B) = 0&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;P(A \cup B) &lt; 1&lt;/math&gt;. The existence of two such events implies the existence of the event &lt;math&gt;A \cup B&lt;/math&gt;, as well, and, if conditional events are admitted, the event &lt;math&gt;(A \cup B) \rightarrow A&lt;/math&gt;. The proof derives a contradiction from the assumption that such a minimally non-trivial set of events exists.

::'''Step 1.''' Consider the probability of &lt;math&gt;(A \cup B) \rightarrow A&lt;/math&gt; after conditioning, first on &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and then instead on &lt;math&gt;A'&lt;/math&gt;.

:::* Conditioning on &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; gives &lt;math&gt;P_A((A \cup B) \rightarrow A) = P(((A \cup B) \rightarrow A) \cap A)/P(A)&lt;/math&gt;. But also, by the new constraint on &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;-functions, &lt;math&gt;P_A((A \cup B) \rightarrow A) = P_A((A \cup B) \cap A)/P_A(A \cup B) =&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;P((A \cup B) \cap A\mid A)/P(A \cup B\mid A) = 1/1 = 1&lt;/math&gt;. Therefore, &lt;math&gt;P(((A \cup B) \rightarrow A) \cap A) = P(A)&lt;/math&gt;.

:::* Conditioning on &lt;math&gt;A'&lt;/math&gt; gives &lt;math&gt;P_{A'}((A \cup B) \rightarrow A) = P(((A \cup B) \rightarrow A) \cap A')/P(A')&lt;/math&gt;. But also, &lt;math&gt;P_{A'}((A \cup B) \rightarrow A) = P_{A'}((A \cup B) \cap A)/P_{A'}(A \cup B) =&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;P((A \cup B) \cap A\mid A')/P(A \cup B\mid A') = 0/P(A \cup B\mid A') = 0&lt;/math&gt;. (The mutual exclusivity of &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; ensures that &lt;math&gt;P(A \cup B\mid A') \neq 0&lt;/math&gt;.) Therefore, &lt;math&gt;P(((A \cup B) \rightarrow A) \cap A') = 0&lt;/math&gt;.

::'''Step 2.''' Instantiate the identity &lt;math&gt;P(X \cap Y) + P(X \cap Y') = P(X)&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt;P(((A \cup B) \rightarrow A) \cap A) + P(((A \cap B) \rightarrow A) \cap A') =&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;P((A \cup B) \rightarrow A)&lt;/math&gt;. By the results from Step 1, the left side reduces to &lt;math&gt;P(A)&lt;/math&gt;, while the right side, by the new constraint on &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;-functions, equals &lt;math&gt;P((A \cup B) \cap A)/P(A \cup B) = P(A)/P(A \cup B)&lt;/math&gt;. Therefore, &lt;math&gt;P(A) = P(A)/P(A \cup B)&lt;/math&gt;, which means that &lt;math&gt;P(A \cup B) = 1&lt;/math&gt;, which contradicts the stipulation that &lt;math&gt;P(A \cup B) &lt; 1&lt;/math&gt;. This completes the proof.

A graphical version of the proof starts with Fig. 2, where the &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; from Fig. 1 are now disjoint and &lt;math&gt;A \rightarrow B&lt;/math&gt; has been replaced by &lt;math&gt;(A \cup B) \rightarrow A&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref group=Note&gt;A proof starting with overlapping &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;, as in Fig. 1, would use mutually exclusive events &lt;math&gt;A \cap B'&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;A' \cap B&lt;/math&gt; in place of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; By the assumption that &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; are possible, &lt;math&gt;x+y&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;u+v&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;. By the assumption that together &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; do not together exhaust all possibilities, &lt;math&gt;u + v + x + y &lt; 1&lt;/math&gt;. And by the new constraint on probability functions, &lt;math&gt;P((A \cup B) \rightarrow A) = P(A\mid A \cup B) =&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;P(A \cap (A \cup B))/P(A \cup B) = P(A)/P(A \cup B)&lt;/math&gt;, which means that

::(1) &lt;math&gt;y + v + w =\frac{x + y}{x + y + u + v},&lt;/math&gt;

Conditioning on an event involves zeroing out the probabilities outside the event's region and increasing the probabilities inside the region by a common scale factor. Here, conditioning on &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; will zero out &lt;math&gt;u, v&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt; and scale up &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;, to &lt;math&gt;x_A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y_A&lt;/math&gt;, respectively, and so

::(2) &lt;math&gt;y_A + 0 + 0 = \frac{x_A + y_A}{x_A + y_A + 0 + 0},&lt;/math&gt; which simplifies to &lt;math&gt;y_A = 1.&lt;/math&gt;

Conditioning instead on &lt;math&gt;A'&lt;/math&gt; will zero out &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; and scale up &lt;math&gt;u, v&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt;, and so

::(3) &lt;math&gt;0 + v_{A'} + w_{A'} = \frac{0 + 0}{0 + 0 + u_A + v_A},&lt;/math&gt; which simplifies to &lt;math&gt;v_{A'} + w_{A'} = 0.&lt;/math&gt;

From (2), it follows that &lt;math&gt;x_A = 0&lt;/math&gt;, and since &lt;math&gt;x_A&lt;/math&gt; is the scaled-up value of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, it must also be that &lt;math&gt;x = 0&lt;/math&gt;. Similarly, from (3), &lt;math&gt;v = w = 0&lt;/math&gt;. But then (1) reduces to &lt;math&gt;y = y/(y + u)&lt;/math&gt;, which implies that &lt;math&gt;y + u = 1&lt;/math&gt;, which contradicts the stipulation that &lt;math&gt;u + v + x + y &lt; 1&lt;/math&gt;.

==Later developments==

In a follow-up article (1986), Lewis noted that the triviality proof can proceed by conditioning not on &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;A'&lt;/math&gt; but instead, by turns, on each of a finite set of mutually exclusive and jointly exhaustive events &lt;math&gt;A, C, D, E, \ldots\,.&lt;/math&gt; He also gave a variant of the proof that involved not total conditioning, in which the probability of either &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;A'&lt;/math&gt; is set to 1, but partial conditioning (i.e., [[Radical_probabilism#Conditioning_on_an_uncertainty_-_Probability_kinematics|Jeffrey conditioning]]), by which probability is incrementally shifted from &lt;math&gt;A'&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;.

Separately, Hájek (1989) pointed out that even without conditioning, if the number of outcomes is large but finite, then in general &lt;math&gt;P(B\mid A) = P(A \cap B)/P(A)&lt;/math&gt;, being a ratio of two outputs of the &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;-function, will take on more values than any single output of the function can. So, for instance, if in Fig. 1 &lt;math&gt;s, t, \ldots &lt;/math&gt;are all multiples of 0.01 (as would be the case if there were exactly 100 equiprobable outcomes), then &lt;math&gt;P(A \rightarrow B)&lt;/math&gt; must be a multiple of 0.01, as well, but &lt;math&gt;P(A \cap B)/P(A)&lt;/math&gt; need not be. That being the case, &lt;math&gt;P(A \rightarrow B)&lt;/math&gt; cannot reliably be made to equal &lt;math&gt;P(B|A)&lt;/math&gt;.

Hájek also argued (1994) that the condition &lt;math&gt;P(A \rightarrow B) = P(B\mid A)&lt;/math&gt; caused acceptable &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;-functions to be implausibly sparse and isolated from one another. One way to put the point: standardly, any weighted average of two probability function is itself a probability function, so that between any two &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;-functions there will be a continuum of weighted-average &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;-functions along which one of the original &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;-functions gradually transforms into the other. But these continua disappear if the added &lt;math&gt;P(A \rightarrow B) = P(B\mid A)&lt;/math&gt; condition is imposed. Now an average of two acceptable &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;-functions will in general not be an acceptable &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;-function.

==Possible rejoinders==

Assuming that &lt;math&gt;P(A \rightarrow B) = P(B\mid A)&lt;/math&gt; holds for a minimally nontrivial set of events and for any &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;-function leads to a contradiction. Thus &lt;math&gt;P(A \rightarrow B) = P(B\mid A)&lt;/math&gt; can hold for any &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;-function only for trivial sets of events—that is the triviality result. However, the proof relies on background assumptions that may be challenged. It may be proposed, for instance, that the referent event of an expression like “&lt;math&gt;A \rightarrow B&lt;/math&gt;” is not fixed for a given &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;, but instead changes as the probability function changes. Or it may be proposed that conditioning on &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; should follow a rule other than &lt;math&gt;P_C(\cdot) = P(\cdot\mid C)&lt;/math&gt;.

But the most common response, among proponents of the &lt;math&gt;P(A \rightarrow B) = P(B\mid A)&lt;/math&gt; condition, has been to explore ways to model conditional events as something other than subsets of a universe set of outcomes. Even before Lewis published his result, Schay (1968) had modeled conditional events as [[ordered pair|ordered ''pairs'']] of sets of outcomes. With that approach and others in the same spirit, conditional events and their associated combination and complementation operations do not constitute the usual [[algebra of sets]] of standard probability theory, but rather a more exotic type of structure, known as a [[conditional event algebra]].

The following is a list of [[celebrity]] [[Inventor (patent)|inventors]] and their [[patents]]. (For the purposes of this article, an inventor is a person who has been granted a [[patent]].) After [[Google]] released a patent search &lt;ref name = "google"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.google.com/patents|title=Google Patent Search}}&lt;/ref&gt; online in December 2006, a website called ''Ironic Sans'',&lt;ref name = "Ironic"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ironicsans.com/2007/01/celebrity_patents.html|title=Celebrity Patents|year=2007|accessdate=2007-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; made the public aware of a number of celebrity patents found through the new patent search engine.

A [[brain tumor]] is an abnormal growth of cells within the brain or inside the skull, and can be cancerous ([[Cancer|malignant]]) or non-cancerous ([[Benign tumor|benign]]). Just over half of all primary brain tumors are malignant; the rest are benign, though they may still be life-threatening. In the United States in 2000, survivors of benign primary brain tumors outnumbered those who had cancerous primary brain tumors by approximately 4:1. Metastatic brain cancer is over six times more common than primary brain cancer, as it occurs in about 10–30% of all people with cancer.&lt;ref name="NABTC"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nabraintumor.org/facts.html|title=Know the Facts| publisher=North American Brain Tumor Coalition|access-date=2006-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This is a list of notable people who have had a primary or [[Metastasis|metastatic]] brain tumor (either [[Benign tumor|benign]] or [[Cancer|malignant]]) at some time in their lives, as confirmed by public information. Tumor type and survival duration are listed where the information is known. Blank spaces in these columns appear where precise information has not been released to the public. Medicine does not designate most long-term survivors as cured.

The [[National Cancer Institute]] estimated 22,070 new cases of primary brain cancer and 12,920 deaths due to the illness in the United State in 2009. The age-adjusted incidence rate is 6.4 per 100,000 per year, and the death rate is 4.3 per 100,000 per year. The lifetime risk of developing brain cancer for someone born today is 0.60%. Only around a third of those diagnosed with brain cancer survive for five years after diagnosis. These high overall mortality rates are a result of the prevalence of aggressive types, such as [[Glioblastoma|glioblastoma multiforme]]. Nearly 14% of new brain tumor diagnoses occur in persons under 20 years of age.&lt;ref name="NCI2006"&gt;{{cite web

The country of [[Bolivia]] hosts numerous active&lt;ref group="i"&gt;In vulcanology and this article active volcanoes are those with [[Holocene]] eruption, that means eruptions in the last 10,000 years.&lt;/ref&gt; and extinct [[volcanoes]] across its territory. The active volcanoes are in western Bolivia making up the [[Cordillera Occidental (Bolivia)|Cordillera Occidental]], the western limit of the [[Altiplano]] plateau. Many of the active volcanoes are international mountains shared with [[Chile]]. All [[Cenozoic]] volcanoes of Bolivia are part of the Central Volcanic Zone (CVZ) of the [[Andean Volcanic Belt]] that results due to processes involved in the [[subduction]] of [[Nazca Plate]] under the [[South American Plate]]. The Central Volcanic Zone is a major upper [[Cenozoic]] volcanic province.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|doi=10.1016/0012-821X(78)90008-0|title=Upper Cenozoic volcanism in the Central Andes — Ages and volumes|journal=Earth and Planetary Science Letters|volume=41|issue=2|pages=175|year=1978|last1=Baker|first1=M.C.W|last2=Francis|first2=P.W}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Apart from Andean volcanoes the [[geology of Bolivia]] host the remnants of ancient volcanoes around the [[Precambrian]] Guaporé Shield in the eastern part of the country.

The '''M8''' is the busiest [[motorway]] in Scotland and one of the busiest in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dft.gov.uk/stellent/groups/dft_transstats/documents/downloadable/dft_transstats_611960.pdf|title=Department for Transport - GOV.UK|work=dft.gov.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; It connects the country's two largest cities, [[Glasgow]] and [[Edinburgh]], and serves other large communities including [[Airdrie, North Lanarkshire|Airdrie]], [[Coatbridge]], [[Greenock]], [[Livingston, Scotland|Livingston]] and [[Paisley, Renfrewshire|Paisley]]. The motorway is {{convert|60|mi|km}} long. A major construction project to build the final section between Newhouse and Baillieston was completed on 30 April 2017.  The motorway has one service station, named [[Heart of Scotland services|Heart of Scotland Services]], previously Harthill due to its proximity to [[Harthill, Scotland|the village]].

==Construction==
With the advent of motorway-building in the United Kingdom in the late 1950s, the M8 was planned as one of a core of new motorways, designed to replace the [[A8 road (Great Britain)|A8 road]] as a high-capacity alternative for intercity travel. The motorway was constructed piecemeal in several stages [[bypass (road)|bypassing]] towns, beginning in 1965 with the opening by [[Under-Secretary of State for Scotland|Minister of State for Scotland]] [[George Willis (politician)|George Willis]] of the bypass of [[Harthill, Scotland|Harthill]].  In 1968 the Renfrew Bypass was opened as the A8(M), becoming part of the M8 when the motorway to the west was connected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pathetic.org.uk/motorways/a8m-renfrew.shtml|title=Pathetic Motorways|author=Steven Jukes|work=pathetic.org.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Glasgow inner city section was constructed between 1968 and 1972, using a scheme outlined in the [[Bruce Report]], which was published as the [[Second World War]] was closing, and which set out a series of initiatives to regenerate the city.  Bruce's scheme evolved into what would become the [[Glasgow Inner Ring Road]], a motorway "box" which would encircle the  city centre, connected to the Renfrew Bypass at its south western corner, and the Monkland Motorway (built over the former route of the [[Monkland Canal]]) towards Edinburgh at its north eastern corner.  Together, these three sections of motorway make up the present day M8.

Most of the motorway's length was complete by 1980. Since then, the only additions have been a new [[interchange (road)|interchange]] with the [[M80 motorway]] in 1992, a {{convert|4|mi|km|adj=on}} eastern extension from [[Newbridge, Edinburgh|Newbridge]] to the then-new [[Edinburgh City Bypass]] in 1995, and the new junction on the approach to the Kingston Bridge in Glasgow connecting to the new M74 extension in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbrd.co.uk/motorway/m8/timeline.shtml M8 motorway construction timeline] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061009152655/http://www.cbrd.co.uk/motorway/m8/timeline.shtml |date=9 October 2006 }}, CRBD.co.uk&lt;/ref&gt; As part of the Scottish Government's 'M8 M73 M74 Motorway Improvements programme', on which construction began in early 2015,&lt;ref name="transportscotland.gov.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.transportscotland.gov.uk/m8m73m74/keeping-communities-informed|title=Keeping communities informed|work=transportscotland.gov.uk|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150217180202/http://www.transportscotland.gov.uk/m8m73m74/keeping-communities-informed|archivedate=17 February 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; the remaining unfinished section between Baillieston (J8) and Newhouse (J6) was built, alongside other major improvements enhancing connectivity to the local road network, M73, and M74.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.transportscotland.gov.uk/project/m8-m73-m74-motorway-improvements|title=M8 M73 M74 Motorway Improvements|work=transportscotland.gov.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new section was fully opened on 30 April 2017.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-39762350&lt;/ref&gt;

==Route==
[[File:70mph.jpg|thumb|left|80px|Sign at junction 2]]
From the Edinburgh City Bypass, the road runs west to junction with the [[M9 motorway (Scotland)|M9 motorway]] (for the [[Forth Road Bridge]]), bypassing to the north of [[Livingston, Scotland|Livingston]] and south of [[Bathgate]]. It continues across Scotland's [[Central Belt]]. The next section – originally designated the Monkland Motorway – begins on the boundary of the [[City of Glasgow]] at the [[M73 motorway]] junction (the main interchange for all routes south via the [[M74 motorway]]) before passing through the districts of [[Barlanark]], [[Riddrie]], [[Dennistoun]] and [[Townhead]] (following the route of the abandoned [[Monkland Canal]]) on the way directly into the [[Central business district|city centre]]. The central section – the uncompleted Glasgow Inner Ring Road – contains numerous junctions serving local communities including [[Cowcaddens]], [[Garnethill]], [[Kelvingrove, Glasgow|Kelvingrove]] and [[Anderston]]. It then crosses the [[River Clyde]] on the [[Kingston Bridge, Glasgow|Kingston Bridge]], runs west through [[Kinning Park]], [[Bellahouston]] and [[Hillington, Glasgow|Hillington]] before leaving Glasgow. Continuing west, it bypasses [[Renfrew, Scotland|Renfrew]] and [[Paisley, Renfrewshire|Paisley]] (carrying traffic directly over what was the main runway at [[Renfrew Airport]], closed in 1966) before serving [[Glasgow International Airport]], running to the south of [[Erskine]], and terminating at [[Langbank]], around {{convert|10|mi|km}} east of [[Greenock]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbrd.co.uk/motorway/m8/exitlist.shtml M8 motorway exit list] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061009152659/http://www.cbrd.co.uk/motorway/m8/exitlist.shtml |date=9 October 2006 }}, CBRD.co.uk&lt;/ref&gt;

The M8 nominally comprises sections of the [[international E-road network]], namely [[European route E05|E05]] (Langbank-Baillieston)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elbruz.org/eroads/E05.htm E05 route descriptor], elbruz.com&lt;/ref&gt; and [[European route E16|E16]] (Baillieston-Edinburgh),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elbruz.org/eroads/E16.htm E16 route descriptor], elbruz.com&lt;/ref&gt; although neither is signposted – no such roads are in the United Kingdom.

==Criticism==
The M8, more explicitly the Glasgow section, is unusual amongst UK motorways (and more similar to many US Interstates) in that it directly serves (and bisects) a large urban area, whereas most other motorways bypass such conurbations. The central Glasgow section is elevated above much of the surrounding area on a concrete [[viaduct]], including several incomplete constructions such as [[M8 Bridge to Nowhere|several pedestrian overpasses]] and adjoining [[arterial road]]s, and has slip roads that enter and exit from the passing ([[Driving on the left or right|right-hand]]) lane. It contains one of the busiest river crossings in Europe at the Kingston Bridge. The speed limit there is reduced to 50&amp;nbsp;mph (80&amp;nbsp;km/h) as a result.

There were successive failed attempts to build the southern flank of the Glasgow Inner Ring Road as defined by the Bruce Report.  This section of road, which is an extension of the [[M74 motorway|M74]], differs in route from the original Bruce proposals of the late 1940s, and was intended to funnel long distance traffic from the north and south which is bound for the southern Clyde Coast and allow it to bypass the urban section of the M8. Following many years of intensive political discussion and legal battles, construction of the M74 Completion scheme began in 2008, and it opened in June 2011.  Early indications are that the new road has been successful in reducing traffic levels on the urban section of the M8.

The root cause of the high congestion on the urban section of the M8 is that traffic from the M73 and M80 is forced onto the eastern section of M8 which within {{convert|2|mi|km}} converges from five lanes to two on the Kingston Bridge approaches. The result of this is often long periods of [[traffic congestion]]. Prior to the construction of the M74 extension, incentives were undertaken in an attempt to minimise delays on this section; these include restricting exits around the Kingston Bridge, a [[ramp meter]]ing programme, and expanded use of electronic signing above and beside the motorway as part of the CITRAC (''Centrally Integrated TRAffic Control'') system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.glasgow.gov.uk/en/Residents/GettingAround/Traffic/CITRAC/ |title=Living in Glasgow – CITRAC |publisher=Glasgow.gov.uk |date=25 August 2009 |accessdate=31 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.trafficscotland.org/vms/index.aspx?type=7|title=Traffic Scotland &gt; Variable Message Signs|work=trafficscotland.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The M8 represents a significant barrier to wildlife expansion, particularly the reintroduced beaver, from the north of Scotland into the [[Scottish Lowlands]], [[Southern Uplands]] and [[Dumfries and Galloway]].

A '''Master of Chemistry''' (or '''M.Chem''') [[Academic degree|degree]] is a specific [[Masters degree|master's degree]] for courses in the field of [[Chemistry]].

==United Kingdom==
In the [[United Kingdom|UK]], the M.Chem degree is an [[undergraduate]] award, available after pursuing a four-year course of study at a [[university]]. It is classed as a level 7 qualification in the [[National Qualifications Framework]].

In Scotland the M.Chem degree is a 5-year course.

==Structure==
In terms of course structure, M.Chem degrees have the same content that is usually seen in other degree programmes, i.e. [[lecture]]s, [[Laboratory|laboratory work]], [[coursework]] and [[exam]]s each year. There are also usually one or more substantial projects undertaken in the fourth year, which may well have [[research]] elements. At the end of the second or third years, there is usually a threshold of academic performance in examinations to be reached to allow progression into the final year. Final results are awarded on the standard [[British undergraduate degree classification]] scale.

{{Millennium Problems}}

The '''Millennium Prize Problems''' are seven problems in [[mathematics]] that were stated by the [[Clay Mathematics Institute]] on May 24, 2000.&lt;ref name="Jaffe_2000"&gt;Arthur M. Jaffe [http://www.ams.org/notices/200606/fea-jaffe.pdf"The Millennium Grand Challenge in Mathematics"], "[[Notices of the AMS]]", June/July 2000, Vol. 53, Nr. 6, p. 652-660 &lt;/ref&gt; The problems are the [[Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture]], [[Hodge conjecture]], [[Navier–Stokes existence and smoothness]], [[P versus NP problem]], [[Poincaré conjecture]], [[Riemann hypothesis]], and [[Yang–Mills existence and mass gap]]. A correct solution to any of the problems results in a {{US$}}1 million prize being awarded by the institute to the discoverer(s).

To date, the only Millennium Prize problem to have been solved is the Poincaré conjecture, which was solved by the [[Russians|Russian]] [[mathematician]] [[Grigori Perelman]] in 2003.

==Solved problem==

===Poincaré conjecture===
{{Main article|Poincaré conjecture}}
In dimension 2, a [[sphere]] is characterized by the fact that it is the only closed and simply-connected surface. The Poincaré conjecture states that this is also true in dimension 3. It is central to the more general problem of classifying all [[3-manifolds]]. The precise formulation of the conjecture states: {{quote|sign=|source=|Every [[simply connected space|simply connected]], [[closed manifold|closed]] [[3-manifold]] is [[homeomorphic]] to the [[3-sphere]].}}

A proof of this conjecture was given by [[Grigori Perelman]] in 2003, based on work by [[Richard S.

==Unsolved problems==

===P versus NP===
{{Main article|P versus NP problem}}
The question is whether or not, for all problems for which an algorithm can ''verify'' a given solution quickly (that is, in [[Polynomial time#Polynomial time|polynomial time]]), an algorithm can also ''find'' that solution quickly. Since the former describes the class of problems termed NP, while the latter describes P, the question is equivalent to asking whether all problems in NP are also in P. This is generally considered one of the most important open questions in [[mathematics]] and [[computation|theoretical computer science]] as it has far-reaching consequences to other problems in [[mathematics]], and to [[biology]], [[philosophy]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://eccc.hpi-web.de/report/2011/108/ |title=Why Philosophers Should Care About Computational Complexity |date=14 August 2011 |author=[[Scott Aaronson]]|publisher=Technical report}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[cryptography]] (see [[P versus NP problem#Consequences of solution|P versus NP problem proof consequences]]). A common example of an NP problem not known to be in P is the [[Boolean satisfiability problem]].

Most mathematicians and computer scientists expect that P&amp;nbsp;≠&amp;nbsp;NP; however, it remains to be proven.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=[[William Gasarch]]|title=The P=?NP poll.|journal=SIGACT News|volume=33|issue=2|pages=34–47|date=June 2002| url=http://www.cs.umd.edu/~gasarch/papers/poll.pdf|doi=10.1145/1052796.1052804|}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The official statement of the problem was given by [[Stephen Cook]].

===Hodge conjecture===
{{Main article|Hodge conjecture}}
The Hodge conjecture is that for [[projective space|projective]] [[algebraic variety|algebraic varieties]], [[Hodge cycle]]s are rational [[linear combination]]s of [[algebraic cycle]]s.

The official statement of the problem was given by [[Pierre Deligne]].

===Riemann hypothesis===
{{Main article|Riemann hypothesis}}
The Riemann hypothesis is that all [[Triviality (mathematics)|nontrivial]] zeros of the analytical continuation of the [[Riemann zeta function]] have a real part of &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. A proof or disproof of this would have far-reaching implications in [[number theory]], especially for the distribution of [[prime number]]s. This was [[Hilbert's eighth problem]], and is still considered an important open problem a century later.

The official statement of the problem was given by [[Enrico Bombieri]].

===Yang–Mills existence and mass gap===
{{Main article|Yang–Mills existence and mass gap}}

In physics, classical [[Yang–Mills theory]] is a generalization of the Maxwell theory of [[electromagnetism]] where the ''chromo''-electromagnetic field itself carries charges. As a classical field theory it has solutions which travel at the speed of light so that its quantum version should describe massless particles ([[gluon]]s). However, the postulated phenomenon of [[color confinement]] permits only bound states of gluons, forming massive particles. This is the [[mass gap]]. Another aspect of confinement is [[asymptotic freedom]] which makes it conceivable that [[quantum Yang-Mills theory]] exists without restriction to low energy scales. The problem is to establish rigorously the existence of the quantum Yang–Mills theory and a mass gap.

The official statement of the problem was given by [[Arthur Jaffe]] and [[Edward Witten]].&lt;ref name="yangmills"&gt;[[Arthur Jaffe]] and [[Edward Witten]] "[http://www.claymath.org/sites/default/files/yangmills.pdf Quantum Yang-Mills theory.]" Official problem description.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Navier–Stokes existence and smoothness===
{{Main article|Navier–Stokes existence and smoothness}}
The [[Navier–Stokes equations]] describe the motion of [[fluid]]s, and are one of the pillars of [[fluid mechanics]].  However, theoretical understanding of their solutions is incomplete.  In particular, solutions of the Navier–Stokes equations often include [[turbulence]], for which general solutions remains one of the greatest [[unsolved problems in physics]], despite its immense importance in science and engineering.

Even basic properties of the solutions to Navier–Stokes have never been proven.  For the three-dimensional system of equations, and given some initial conditions, mathematicians have not yet proved that [[Smooth function|smooth solutions]] always exist, or that if they do exist, they have bounded [[energy]] per unit mass.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}  This is called the ''[[Navier–Stokes existence and smoothness]]'' problem.

The problem is to make progress towards a mathematical theory that will give insight into these equations, by proving either that smooth, globally defined solutions exist that meet certain conditions, or that they do not always exist and the equations break down. The official statement of the problem was given by [[Charles Fefferman]].

===Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture===
{{Main article|Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture}}
The Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture deals with certain types of equations: those defining [[elliptic curve]]s over the [[rational number]]s. The conjecture is that there is a simple way to tell whether such equations have a finite or infinite number of rational solutions. [[Hilbert's tenth problem]] dealt with a more general type of equation, and in that case it was proven that there is no way to decide whether a given equation even has any solutions.

The official statement of the problem was given by [[Andrew Wiles]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Andrew Wiles|Wiles, Andrew]] (2006). "[http://www.claymath.org/sites/default/files/birchswin.pdf The Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture]". In Carlson, James; [[Arthur Jaffe|Jaffe, Arthur]]; Wiles, Andrew.

{{About|ontology in information science|the study of the nature of being|Ontology}}
{{Information science}}
In [[computer science]] and [[information science]], an '''ontology''' encompasses a [[Representation (systemics)|representation]], formal naming, and [[definition]] of the [[Category of being|categories]], [[Property (philosophy)|properties]], and [[Relation (history of concept)|relations]] between the [[concepts]], [[data]], and [[entities]] that substantiate one, many, or all [[Domain of discourse|domains]].

Every [[Outline of academic disciplines|field]] creates ontologies to limit [[complexity]] and organize [[information]] into [[data]] and [[knowledge]]. As new ontologies are made, their use hopefully improves [[problem solving]] within that domain. Translating [[research papers]] within every field is a problem made easier when [[experts]] from different countries maintain a [[controlled vocabulary]] of [[jargon]] between each of their languages.&lt;ref name="Budin2005"&gt;{{citation|author=G Budin|editor=Helle V. Dam|others=Jan Engberg, Heidrun Gerzymisch-Arbogast|title=Knowledge Systems and Translation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IL2E9xuJLAAC&amp;pg=PA113|year=2005|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|isbn=978-3-11-018297-2|page=113|chapter=Ontology-driven translation management}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since [[Google]] started an initiative called [[Knowledge Graph]], a substantial amount of research has gone on using the phrase ''knowledge graph'' as a generalized term. Although there is no clear definition for the term knowledge graph, it is sometimes used as synonym for ontology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-1695/paper4.pdf|title=Towards a Definition of Knowledge Graphs|last1=Ehrlinger|first1=Lisa|last2=Wöß|first2=Wolfram|date=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; One common interpretation is that a knowledge graph represents a collection of interlinked descriptions of entities – real-world objects, events, situations or abstract concepts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ontotext.com/knowledgehub/fundamentals/what-is-a-knowledge-graph/|title=What is a Knowledge Graph?|date=2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike ontologies, knowledge graphs, such as Google's [[Knowledge Graph]] and [[DBpedia]], often contain large volumes of factual information with less formal semantics. In some contexts, the term ''knowledge graph'' is used to refer to any [[knowledge base]] that is represented as a [[Graph (abstract data type)|graph]].

== Etymology ==
{{main|Ontology#Etymology}}
The [[Compound (linguistics)|compound]] word ''ontology'' combines ''[[wikt:onto-|onto]]-'', from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] [[wikt:ὤν|ὄν]]&lt;!--[sic] (neuter), not ὤν (masculine)--&gt;, ''on'' ([[Genitive|gen.]] ὄντος, ''ontos''), i.e. "being; that which is", which is the [[Present tense|present]] [[participle]] of the [[verb]] [[wikt:εἰμί|εἰμί]], ''eimí'', i.e. "to be, I am", and [[wikt:-λογία|-λογία]], ''[[wikt:-logia|-logia]]'', i.e. "logical discourse", see [[classical compound]]s for this type of word formation.&lt;ref name=OnlineEtDict&gt;{{cite web|title=ontology|url=https://www.etymonline.com/word/ontology|publisher=[[Online Etymology Dictionary]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=LSJ&gt;{{LSJ|ei)mi/1|εἰμί|ref}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the [[etymology]] is Greek, the oldest extant record of the word itself, the [[New Latin]] form ''ontologia'', appeared in 1606 in the work ''Ogdoas Scholastica'' by [[Jacob Lorhard]] (''Lorhardus'') and in 1613 in the ''Lexicon philosophicum'' by [[Rudolf Göckel]] (''Goclenius'').

The first occurrence in English of ''ontology'' as recorded by the ''OED'' (''Oxford English Dictionary'', online edition, 2008) came in ''Archeologia Philosophica Nova'' or ''New Principles of Philosophy'' by Gideon Harvey.

==Overview==
What ontologies in both [[information science]] and [[philosophy]] have in common is the attempt to represent entities, ideas, and events, with all their interdependent properties and relations, according to a system of categories. In both fields, there is considerable work on problems of [[ontology engineering]] (e.g., [[Willard Van Orman Quine|Quine]] and [[Saul Kripke|Kripke]] in philosophy, [[John F. Sowa|Sowa]] and [[Nicola Guarino|Guarino]] in computer science),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=J. F. |last=Sowa |title=Top-level ontological categories
|journal=International Journal of Human-Computer Studies |volume=43 |issue=5-6 (November/December)
|year=1995 |pages=669–85 |doi=10.1006/ijhc.1995.1068 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and debates concerning to what extent [[normative]] ontology is possible (e.g., [[foundationalism]] and [[coherentism]] in philosophy, [[Basic formal ontology|BFO]] and [[Cyc]] in artificial intelligence). [[Applied ontology]] is considered a spiritual successor to prior work in philosophy, however many current efforts are more concerned with establishing [[controlled vocabularies]] of narrow domains than [[first principles]], the existence of [[Essence|fixed essences]], or whether enduring objects (e.g., [[perdurantism]] and [[endurantism]]) may be ontologically more primary than [[process]]es.

Every field uses ontological assumptions to frame explicit theories, research, and applications. For instance, the [[philosophy and economics#Definition and ontology of economics|definition and ontology of economics]] is a primacy concern in [[Marxist economics]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Giulio |last=Palermo|url=http://cje.oxfordjournals.org/content/31/4/539.short |title=The ontology of economic power in capitalism: mainstream economics and Marx |journal=Cambridge Journal of Economics |volume=31 |issue=4 |pages=539–561 |date=10 January 2007 |doi=10.1093/cje/bel036 |accessdate=16 June 2013 |via=Oxford Journals }}&lt;/ref&gt;, but also in other [[Outline of economics#Branches of economics|subfields of economics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Zuniga, Gloria L. |url=https://ideas.repec.org/p/pra/mprapa/5566.html |title=An Ontology Of Economic Objects |website=Ideas.repec.org |publisher=Research Division of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis |date=1999-02-02 |accessdate=2013-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of economics relying on information science occurs in cases where a simulation or model is intended to enable economic decisions, such as determining what [[capital asset]]s are at risk and by how much (see [[risk management]]).

[[Artificial intelligence]] has retained the most attention regarding [[applied ontology]] in subfields like [[natural language processing]] within [[machine translation]] and [[knowledge representation]], but ontology editors are being used often in a range of fields like education without the intent to contribute to AI.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Mark |last=Musen|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4883684 |title=The Protégé Project: A Look Back and a Look Forward |doi=10.1145/2757001.2757003|pmc=4883684}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{main|Metaphysics#History}}
{{main|Artificial intelligence#History}}
Ontologies arise out of the branch of [[philosophy]] known as [[metaphysics]], which deals with questions like "what exists?" and "what is the nature of reality?" One of five traditional branches of philosophy, metaphysics is concerned with exploring existence through properties, entities, and relations such as those between [[particular]]s and [[Universal (metaphysics)|universals]], [[Intrinsic and extrinsic properties (philosophy)|intrinsic and extrinsic properties]], or [[essence]] and [[existence]]. Metaphysics has been an ongoing topic of discussion since recorded history.

Since the mid-1970s, researchers in the field of [[artificial intelligence]] (AI) have recognized that [[knowledge engineering]] is the key to building large and powerful AI systems. AI researchers argued that they could create new ontologies as [[computational model]]s that enable certain kinds of [[automated reasoning]], which was only [[AI winter|marginally successful]]. In the 1980s, the AI community began to use the term ''ontology'' to refer to both a theory of a modeled world and a component of [[knowledge-based systems]]. Some researchers, drawing inspiration from philosophical ontologies, viewed computational ontology as a kind of applied philosophy.&lt;ref name="TG08"&gt;{{cite book |first=T. |last=Gruber |authorlink=Tom Gruber |year=2008 |url=http://tomgruber.org/writing/ontology-definition-2007.htm  |title=Ontology |work=Encyclopedia of Database Systems |editor1-first=Ling |editor1-last=Liu |editor2-first=M. Tamer |editor2-last=Özsu |publisher=Springer-Verlag|isbn=978-0-387-49616-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1990s, the widely cited Web page and paper "Toward Principles for the Design of Ontologies Used for Knowledge Sharing" by [[Tom Gruber]]&lt;ref name="TRG95"&gt;{{cite journal |first=T. |last=Gruber |authorlink=Tom Gruber |title=Toward Principles for the Design of Ontologies Used for Knowledge Sharing |journal=International Journal of Human-Computer Studies |volume=43 |issue=5–6 |pages=907–928 |year=1995 |doi=10.1006/ijhc.1995.1081}}&lt;/ref&gt; is credited with a deliberate definition of ''ontology'' as a technical term in [[computer science]]. Gruber introduced the term as ''a specification of a conceptualization'': &lt;blockquote&gt;An ontology is a description (like a formal specification of a program) of the concepts and relationships that can formally exist for an agent or a community of agents. This definition is consistent with the usage of ontology as set of concept definitions, but more general. And it is a different sense of the word than its use in philosophy.&lt;ref name="TRG01"&gt;{{cite web |first=T. |last=Gruber |authorlink=Tom Gruber |year=2001 |url=http://www-ksl.stanford.edu/kst/what-is-an-ontology.html |title=What is an Ontology? |publisher=[[Stanford University]] |accessdate=2009-11-09 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100716004426/http://www-ksl.stanford.edu/kst/what-is-an-ontology.html |archive-date=2010-07-16 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Attempting to distance ontologies from taxonomies and similar efforts in [[knowledge modeling]] that rely on [[Class (computer programming)|classes]] and [[Inheritance (object-oriented programming)|inheritance]], Gruber stated (1993): &lt;blockquote&gt;Ontologies are often equated with taxonomic hierarchies of classes, class definitions, and the subsumption relation, but ontologies need not be limited to these forms. Ontologies are also not limited to [[Conservative extension|conservative definitions]]&amp;nbsp;&amp;mdash; that is, definitions in the traditional logic sense that only introduce terminology and do not add any knowledge about the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
|first=H. B. |last=Enderton |authorlink=Herbert Enderton |date=1972-05-12 |title=A Mathematical Introduction to Logic |location=San Diego, CA |publisher=Academic Press |edition=1 |page=295 |isbn=978-0-12-238450-9 |postscript=&amp;nbsp;2nd edition; January 5, 2001, {{ISBN|978-0-12-238452-3}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; To specify a conceptualization, one needs to state axioms that do constrain the possible interpretations for the defined terms.&lt;ref name="TRG93"&gt;{{cite journal |first=Thomas R. |last=Gruber |authorlink=Tom Gruber |date=June 1993 |url=http://tomgruber.org/writing/ontolingua-kaj-1993.pdf |format=PDF |title=A translation approach to portable ontology specifications |journal=[[Knowledge Acquisition]] |volume=5 |issue=2 |pages=199–220 |doi=10.1006/knac.1993.1008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

As refinement of Gruber's definition Feilmayr and Wöß (2016) stated: "An ontology is a formal, explicit specification of a shared conceptualization that is characterized by high semantic expressiveness required for increased complexity."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Feilmayr|first1=Christina|last2=Wöß|first2=Wolfram|title=An analysis of ontologies and their success factors for application to business|journal=Data &amp; Knowledge Engineering|date=2016|pages=1–23|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169023X1500110X|accessdate=23 May 2017|doi=10.1016/j.datak.2015.11.003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Components ==
{{Main article|Ontology components}}
Contemporary ontologies share many structural similarities, regardless of the language in which they are expressed.  Most ontologies describe individuals (instances), classes (concepts), attributes, and relations.  In this section each of these components is discussed in turn.

Common components of ontologies include:
; Individuals
: Instances or objects (the basic or "ground level" objects)
; [[Class (set theory)|Class]]es&lt;!-- This deliberately links to the disambiguation page --&gt;
: Sets, collections, concepts, [[Class (computer science)|classes in programming]], [[Class (philosophy)|types of objects]], or kinds of things
; [[Attribute (computing)|Attribute]]s
: Aspects, properties, features, characteristics, or parameters that objects (and classes) can have
; [[Relation (mathematics)|Relations]]
: Ways in which classes and individuals can be related to one another
; Function terms
: Complex structures formed from certain relations that can be used in place of an individual term in a statement
; Restrictions
: Formally stated descriptions of what must be true in order for some assertion to be accepted as input
; Rules
: Statements in the form of an if-then (antecedent-consequent) sentence that describe the logical inferences that can be drawn from an assertion in a particular form
; Axioms
: Assertions (including rules) in a [[logical form]] that together comprise the overall theory that the ontology describes in its domain of application.  This definition differs from that of "axioms" in [[generative grammar]] and [[formal logic]].  In those disciplines, axioms include only statements asserted as ''a priori'' knowledge.  As used here, "axioms" also include the theory derived from axiomatic statements
; [[Event (philosophy)|Events]]&lt;!-- this links  to the philosophy sense of 'Events' as that is currently the only article describing the issues around defining events in the ontology community--&gt;
: The changing of attributes or relations

Ontologies are commonly encoded using [[ontology language]]s.

== Types ==

=== Domain ontology&lt;!--linked from 'Domain ontology'--&gt; ===
A domain ontology (or domain-specific ontology) represents concepts which belong to a part of the world, such as biology or politics. Each domain ontology typically models domain specific definitions of terms. For example, the word ''[[:wikt:card|card]]'' has many different meanings. An ontology about the domain of [[poker]] would model the "[[playing card]]" meaning of the word, while an ontology about the domain of [[computer hardware]] would model the "[[punched card]]" and "[[video card]]" meanings.

Since domain ontologies are written by different people, they represent concepts in very specific and unique ways, and are often incompatible within the same project. As systems that rely on domain ontologies expand, they often need to merge domain ontologies by hand-tuning each entity or using a combination of software merging and hand-tuning. This presents a challenge to the ontology designer. Different ontologies in the same domain arise due to different languages, different intended usage of the ontologies, and different perceptions of the domain (based on cultural background, education, ideology, etc.).

At present, merging ontologies that are not developed from a common [[upper ontology]] is a largely manual process and therefore time-consuming and expensive. Domain ontologies that use the same upper ontology to provide a set of basic elements with which to specify the meanings of the domain ontology entities can be merged with less effort. There are studies on generalized techniques for merging ontologies,&lt;ref name="Dynamic Ontology Repair"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dream.inf.ed.ac.uk/projects/dor/ |title=Project: Dynamic Ontology Repair |publisher= University of Edinburgh Department of Informatics|accessdate=2 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; but this area of research is still ongoing, and it's a recent event to see the issue sidestepped by having multiple domain ontologies using the same upper ontology like the [[OBO Foundry]].

=== Upper ontology ===
{{Main article|Upper ontology}}

An [[Upper ontology (computer science)|upper ontology]] (or foundation ontology) is a model of the common relations and objects that are generally applicable across a wide range of domain ontologies. It usually employs a [[core glossary]] that contains the terms and associated object descriptions as they are used in various relevant domain ontologies.

Standardized upper ontologies available for use include [[Basic Formal Ontology|BFO]], [[BORO method]], [[Dublin Core]], [[General Formal Ontology|GFO]], [[OpenCyc]]/[[ResearchCyc]], [[Suggested Upper Merged Ontology|SUMO]], [[UMBEL]], the Unified Foundational Ontology (UFO),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Giancarlo Guizzardi &amp; Gerd Wagner|url=http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-125/paper2.pdf|accessdate=31 March 2014|title=A Unified Foundational Ontology and some Applications of it in Business Modeling}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Upper ontology (computer science)#DOLCE|DOLCE]].&lt;ref name="DOLCE"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.loa-cnr.it/DOLCE.html |title=Laboratory for Applied Ontology - DOLCE |publisher=Laboratory for Applied Ontology (LOA)|accessdate=10 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DOLCE-OWL"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ontologydesignpatterns.org/ont/dul/DUL.owl |title=OWL version of DOLCE+DnS  |publisher=Semantic Technology Lab|accessdate=21 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[WordNet]] has been considered an upper ontology by some and has been used as a linguistic tool for learning domain ontologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Roberto |last1=Navigli  |first2=Paola |last2=Velardi |year=2004 |url=http://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/pdf/10.1162/089120104323093276 |format=PDF |title=Learning Domain Ontologies from Document Warehouses and Dedicated Web Sites |journal=[[Computational Linguistics (journal)|Computational Linguistics]] |volume=30 |issue=2 |publisher=MIT Press |pages=151–179 |doi=10.1162/089120104323093276}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ontology engineering]] (also called ontology building)  is a set of tasks related to the development of ontologies for a particular domain.&lt;ref name="PIS00"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pouchard|first1=Line|last2=Ivezic|first2=Nenad|last3=Schlenoff|first3=Craig|date=March 2000|title=Ontology Engineering for Distributed Collaboration in Manufacturing|url=http://www.mel.nist.gov/msidlibrary/doc/AISfinal2.pdf|format=PDF|work=Proceedings of the AIS2000 conference}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a subfield of [[knowledge engineering]] that studies the ontology development process, the ontology life cycle, the methods and methodologies for building ontologies, and the tools and languages that support them.&lt;ref name="PFC04"&gt;{{cite book |first1=Ascunion |last1=Gómez-Pérez |first2=Mariano |last2=Fernández-López |first3=Oscar |last3=Corcho |year=2004 |title=Ontological Engineering: With Examples from the Areas of Knowledge Management, E-commerce and the Semantic Web |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-1-85233-551-9 |page=403 |edition=1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DMN"&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Antonio |last1=De Nicola |first2=Michele |last2=Missikoff |first3=Roberto |last3=Navigli |year=2009 |url=http://www.dsi.uniroma1.it/~navigli/pubs/De_Nicola_Missikoff_Navigli_2009.pdf |format=PDF |title=A Software Engineering Approach to Ontology Building |journal=[[Information Systems (journal)|Information Systems]] |volume=34 |issue=2 |publisher=Elsevier |pages=258–275 | doi = 10.1016/j.is.2008.07.002 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ontology engineering aims to make explicit the knowledge contained in software applications, and organizational procedures for a particular domain. Ontology engineering offers a direction for overcoming semantic obstacles, such as those related to the definitions of business terms and software classes. Known challenges with ontology engineering include:
# Ensuring the ontology is ''current'' with [[domain knowledge]] and term use
# Providing ''sufficient specificity and concept coverage'' for the domain of interest, thus minimizing the [[content completeness problem]]
# Ensuring the ontology can support its use cases

=== Editors ===
{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2018}}
'''Ontology editors''' are applications designed to assist in the creation or manipulation of [[ontology (information science)|ontologies]]. It's common for ontology editors to use one or more [[ontology language (computer science)|ontology languages]].

Aspects of ontology editors include: the visual navigation possibilities within the [[knowledge model]], [[inference engine]]s and [[information extraction]], support for modules, import &amp; export foreign [[knowledge representation]] languages for [[ontology matching]], and the support of meta-ontologies such as [[OWL-S]], [[Dublin Core]], etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Emhimed |last=Alatrish |url=http://www.ef.uns.ac.rs/mis/archive-pdf/2013%20-%20No2/MIS2013-2-4.pdf |title=A comparison of some ontology editors }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Learning ===
{{Main article|Ontology learning}}

Ontology learning is the automatic or semi-automatic creation of ontologies, including extracting a domain's terms from natural language text. As building ontologies manually is extremely labor-intensive and time consuming, there is great motivation to automate the process.  Information extraction and text mining have been explored to automatically link ontologies to documents, for example in the context of the BioCreative challenges.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

== Languages ==
{{Main article|Ontology language}}
An [[ontology language]] is a [[formal language]] used to encode an ontology. There are a number of such languages for ontologies, both proprietary and standards-based:
* [[Common Algebraic Specification Language]] is a general logic-based specification language developed within the IFIP working group 1.3 "Foundations of System Specifications" and is a ''de facto'' standard language for software specifications. It is now being applied to ontology specifications in order to provide modularity and structuring mechanisms.
* [[Common logic]] is ISO standard 24707, a specification of a family of ontology languages that can be accurately translated into each other.
* The [[Cyc]] project has its own ontology language called [[CycL]], based on [[first-order predicate calculus]] with some higher-order extensions.
* [[DOGMA]] (Developing Ontology-Grounded Methods and Applications) adopts the fact-oriented modeling approach to provide a higher level of semantic stability.
* The [[Gellish]] language includes rules for its own extension and thus integrates an ontology with an ontology language.
* [[IDEF5]] is a [[software engineering]] method to develop and maintain usable, accurate, domain ontologies.
* [[Knowledge Interchange Format|KIF]] is a syntax for [[first-order logic]] that is based on [[S-expression]]s.  SUO-KIF is a derivative version supporting the [[Suggested Upper Merged Ontology]].
* [[Meta-Object Facility|MOF]] and [[Unified Modeling Language|UML]] are standards of the [[Object Management Group|OMG]]
* [[Olog]] is a [[Category theory|category theoretic]] approach to ontologies, emphasizing translations between ontologies using [[functor]]s. 
* [[Open Biomedical Ontologies|OBO]], a language used for biological and biomedical ontologies.
* [[OntoUML]] is an ontologically well-founded profile of UML for conceptual modeling of domain ontologies.
* [[Web Ontology Language|OWL]] is a language for making ontological statements, developed as a follow-on from [[Resource Description Framework|RDF]] and [[RDFS]], as well as earlier ontology language projects including [[Ontology Inference Layer|OIL]], [[DARPA Agent Markup Language|DAML]], and [[DAMLplusOIL|DAML+OIL]]. OWL is intended to be used over the [[World Wide Web]], and all its elements (classes, properties and individuals) are defined as RDF [[web resource|resource]]s, and identified by [[Uniform Resource Identifier|URI]]s.
* [[Rule Interchange Format]] (RIF) and [[F-Logic]] combine ontologies and rules.
* [[Semantic Application Design Language]] (SADL)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sadl.sourceforge.net/sadl.html |title=SADL |work=[[Sourceforge]] |accessdate=10 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; captures a subset of the expressiveness of [[Web Ontology Language|OWL]], using an English-like language entered via an [[Eclipse (software)|Eclipse]] Plug-in.
* [[SBVR]] (Semantics of Business Vocabularies and Rules) is an OMG standard adopted in industry to build ontologies.
* [[TOVE Project]], TOronto Virtual Enterprise project

The W3C [[Linked data#Linking Open Data community project|Linking Open Data community project]] coordinates attempts to converge different ontologies into worldwide [[Semantic Web]].

== Libraries ==
The development of ontologies has led to the emergence of services providing lists or directories of ontologies called ontology libraries.

The following are libraries of human-selected ontologies.
* COLORE&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://stl.mie.utoronto.ca/colore/ |title=COLORE |accessdate=4 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an open repository of first-order ontologies in [[Common Logic]] with formal links between ontologies in the repository.
* DAML Ontology Library&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.daml.org/ontologies/ |title=DAML Ontology Library |accessdate=10 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; maintains a legacy of ontologies in DAML.
* Ontology Design Patterns portal&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ontologydesignpatterns.org |title=ODP Library |accessdate=21 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a wiki repository of reusable components and practices for ontology design, and also maintains a list of ''exemplary ontologies''. 
* Protégé Ontology Library&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://protegewiki.stanford.edu/index.php/Protege_Ontology_Library |title=Protege Ontology Library |accessdate=10 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; contains a set of OWL, Frame-based and other format ontologies.
* SchemaWeb&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.schemaweb.info/ |title=SchemaWeb |accessdate=10 February 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110810084028/http://www.schemaweb.info/ |archivedate=10 August 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; is a directory of RDF schemata expressed in RDFS, OWL and DAML+OIL.

The following are both directories and search engines.

'''''Orbis Latinus''''', originally by [[Johann Georg Theodor Grässe|Dr. J. G. Th. Graesse]], is a [[Latin]]-German dictionary of Latin place names. Most recently updated in 1972, it is the most comprehensive modern reference work of Latin [[toponymy]], covering antiquity to modern times.

==History==
Johann Georg Theodor Graesse (1814–1885), a librarian, art historian, and literary scholar, published the first edition of ''Orbis Latinus'' in 1861. Although this first edition already listed a considerable number of names from around the world, it contained large gaps, especially in its coverage of more obscure locations. There followed a 1909 edition, almost doubled in size, under the direction of the [[University of Breslau]] Professor [[Frederick Benedict]] (b. 1850), who evaluated previously published sources and historical works far more systematically. Benedict increased the keywords of ''Orbis'', especially in regard to central Europe and the Middle Ages, but largely ignored areas outside of Europe, and did not consider material beyond the early modern period. Nevertheless, this work was re-released in a third edition, substantially unchanged, in 1922.

In the decades after World War II, [[Helmut Plechl]] (b. 1920), together with [[Sophie-Charlotte Plechl]], began work on the fourth edition of ''Orbis Latinus'', adding many names of monasteries, mountains, and bodies of water, and taking into account material dating from antiquity to the Latin literature of the nineteenth century. This was first published in a one-volume manual edition in 1971, followed by a large three-volume edition in 1972. Due to the political instability of the period, the political boundaries of Germany as they existed in 1937 were used for the work.

The Bavarian State Library made images of the three-volume 1972 edition available online in July 2010, and has also made a full-text searchable version available.

'''Painite''' is a very rare [[borate mineral]]. It was first found in [[Myanmar]] by British [[mineralogist]] and gem dealer Arthur C.D. Pain in the 1950s. When it was confirmed as a new mineral species, the mineral was named after him.&lt;ref name=HB/&gt;

The chemical makeup of painite contains [[calcium]], [[zirconium]], [[boron]], [[aluminium]] and [[oxygen]] (CaZrAl&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;15&lt;/sub&gt;(BO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)). The mineral also contains trace amounts of [[chromium]] and [[vanadium]], which are responsible for Painite's typically orange-red to brownish-red color,&lt;ref name = AM89/&gt;&lt;ref name=Caltech&gt;[http://minerals.gps.caltech.edu/FILES/Visible/painite/Index.html Painite history at Caltech]. Minerals.gps.caltech.edu. Retrieved on 2012-05-28.&lt;/ref&gt; similar to [[topaz]]. The crystals are naturally [[hexagonal crystal system|hexagonal]] in shape, and, until late 2004, only two had been cut into faceted gemstones.&lt;ref&gt;[http://io9.com/5902212/ten-gemstones-that-are-rarer-than-diamond Ten gemstones that are rarer than diamond]. io9.com&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discovery and occurrence==
Extensive exploration in the [[Mogok]] region has identified several new painite occurrences that have been vigorously explored resulting in several thousand new painite specimens.&lt;ref name=Caltech/&gt;

'''''Problems in General Physics''''' is a book written by [[Igor Irodov]] and first published in 1981. It is a collection of about 2000 physics problems in [[mechanics]], [[thermodynamics]], [[molecular physics]], [[oscillation]]s, and [[electromagnetism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/IrodovProblemsInGeneralPhysics|title=Problems in General Physics|last=I. E. Irodov|date=1988-01-01|publisher=Mir Publishers}}&lt;/ref&gt; In India, the book is widely used by high school students preparing for engineering entrance examinations such as the [[Joint Entrance Examination]]. Each problem in the book is really unique, especially mechanics problems, and the questions help students understand the basic laws of physics.

The ''Schiaparelli'' Entry, Descent, and Landing Demonstrator module is named for [[Giovanni Schiaparelli]] (1835–1910), an astronomer active in the 19th century who made Mars observations.&lt;ref name="Go 2015"&gt;{{cite news |last=Amos |first=Jonathan |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-34919025 |title=Europe's ExoMars missions are go - finally |work=BBC News |date=25 November 2015 |accessdate=23 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, he recorded features he called ''canali'' in his native Italian.&lt;ref name="Go 2015"/&gt; His observations of what translates as channels in English inspired many.&lt;ref name="Go 2015"/&gt; The dark streaks on Mars are an [[albedo]] feature which is related to dust distribution; these albedo features on Mars slowly change over time, and in the last few decades have been monitored by Mars orbiters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Marlaire |first=Ruth |url=http://www.nasa.gov/centers/ames/research/2007/marswarming.html |title=A Gloomy Mars Warms Up |work=NASA |date=14 May 2007 |accessdate=23 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schiaparelli is famous for making hand-drawn maps of Mars during its 1877 oppositions with Earth with an optical refracting telescope.&lt;ref name="Lander naming"/&gt; He was also the first astronomer to determine the relationship between comet debris and yearly meteor showers.&lt;ref name="Lander naming"/&gt;

The mission was named in November 2013; previously it was known as the Exomars Entry, descent and landing Demonstrator Module, or ExoMars EDM for short.&lt;ref name="Lander naming"/&gt; Another name was ExoMars ''static lander'', however some designs for what was the static lander are quite different due to various stages of design and program restructuring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Amos |first=Jonathan |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/8168954.stm |title=Science &amp; Environment &amp;#124; Europe's Mars rover slips to 2018 |publisher=BBC News |date=25 July 2009 |accessdate=4 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another name, especially for both orbiter and lander together is ''ExoMars 2016''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://meetingorganizer.copernicus.org/EPSC2015/EPSC2015-508.pdf |format=PDF |title=Micro-Ares, An electric field sensor for ExoMars 2016 |website=Meetingorganizer.copernicus.org |accessdate=4 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:ExoMars (14042710527).jpg|thumb|Models of ''Schiaparelli'' and the ExoMars rover at ESA ESTEC, 2014]]
The EDM traces itself back to the ESA [[Aurora programme]], which has the goal of human exploration of space, and thus producing missions that are building blocks to support this goal.&lt;ref name="researchgate1"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.researchgate.net/figure/237706082_fig2_Figure-2-ExoMars-Rover-in-stowed-configuration |title=Figure 2: ExoMars Rover in stowed configuration - Scientific Figure on ResearchGate |website=Researchgate.net |date= |accessdate=4 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; ExoMars originated out of this, and provides context for understanding the EDM.&lt;ref name="researchgate1"/&gt; Schiaparelli forms an important "block" of learning how to land heavy payloads on Mars, which is vital to future manned missions.&lt;ref name="researchgate1"/&gt; Another "block" is the ExoMars rover, which is intended to demonstrate among other things the ability to traverse several km/miles on the surface of Mars.&lt;ref name="researchgate1"/&gt; The Aurora program is focused on two types of the mission, one are larger flagship spacecraft and the other are smaller missions specifically meant to offload risk from the larger missions.&lt;ref name="esa20021011"/&gt; There are also various science goals:

{{quote|The ExoMars scientific objectives are: the search for traces of past and present life; the characterization of the water/geochemical environment as a function of depth in the shallow subsurface; the study of the surface environment and identification of hazards to future human missions; and finally, the investigation of the planet’s subsurface and deep interior, to better understand the evolution and habitability of Mars. |The ExoMars Rover - Overview of Phase B1 Results, 2008&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.researchgate.net/figure/237706082_fig2_Figure-2-ExoMars-Rover-in-stowed-configuration |title=Figure 2: ExoMars Rover in stowed configuration - Scientific Figure on ResearchGate |website=Researchgate.net |date= |accessdate=4 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

An important date in its development was 2005, when the ESA council approved 650 million Euros for a Mars rover and static lander.&lt;ref name="spaceflight2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://spaceflight101.com/exomars/project-history/ |title=Project History – ExoMars |website=Spaceflight101.com |date= |accessdate=4 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; At this time the idea was for a single launch bringing both a [[Mars Exploration Rover]] class rover and instrumented static lander to Mars with a simpler cruise stage;in this case the static lander both landed the rover and performed its own studies.&lt;ref name="researchgate1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="spaceflight2"/&gt; However to accomplish its mission goals within the constraints of a Soyuz launcher, the rover was budgeted for 6&amp;nbsp;kg at one point.&lt;ref name="spaceflight2"/&gt; This led to the search for bigger rockets; the [[Ariane V]], [[Atlas V]], and Proton were evaluated.&lt;ref name="spaceflight2"/&gt; As heavier launchers were considered, heavier rovers from 180 even up to 600&amp;nbsp;kg were considered, and eventually the idea of test lander to offload risk from the rover lander was taken seriously and fit well with a two launch setup that allowed for a heavier orbiter and a heavier rover.&lt;ref name="spaceflight2"/&gt; Another factor was if the demonstrator should wait in Mars orbit for the Global dust storm to start.&lt;ref name="spaceflight2"/&gt; Early in the development, the idea was for the lander to be carried by a dedicated cruise stage called the ''Carrier Module''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.researchgate.net/figure/237706082_fig3_Figure-5-Locomotion-Subsystem-design-of-MDA |title=Figure 5: Locomotion Subsystem design of MDA - Scientific Figure on ResearchGate |website=Researchgate.net |date= |accessdate=4 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, the Trace Gas Orbiter mission was merged into ExoMars becoming the mother-ship for the EDM.&lt;ref name="spaceflight2"/&gt;

The data obtained from ''Schiaparelli'' are expected to provide ESA and Roscosmos with the technology for landing on the surface of Mars with a controlled soft landing, key technologies for the 2020 [[ExoMars rover]] mission.&lt;ref name="EDL-demonstrator-module"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://exploration.esa.int/mars/47852-entry-descent-and-landing-demonstrator-module/ |title=Schiaparelli: the ExoMars Entry, Descent and Landing Demonstrator Module |publisher=European Space Agency |date=2013 |accessdate=1 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pre-launch===
The {{convert|577|kg|lb|abbr=on}} descent module ''Schiaparelli'' and orbiter completed testing and were integrated to a [[Proton-M]] rocket at the [[Baikonur cosmodrome]] in [[Baikonur]] in mid-January 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://spaceref.com/mars/exomars-2016-schiaparelli-module-in-baikonur.html |title=ExoMars 2016 Schiaparelli Module in Baikonur |work=ESA |publisher=SpaceRef |date=6 January 2016 |accessdate=6 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; TGO and EDM arrived at Baikonur in December 2015.&lt;ref name="spaceflight2"/&gt; In February the spacecraft was mounted to the Briz-M upper stage, and in early March that was attached to the Proton rocket.&lt;ref name="spaceflight2"/&gt;

The ''Schiaparelli'' lander separated from the TGO orbiter on 16 October 2016, three days before arrival at Mars, and entered the atmosphere at {{convert|21000|km/h|mph|abbr=on}} on 19 October 2016.&lt;ref name="NewSci March" /&gt; (see also [[Mars atmospheric entry]]) When the lander disconnected from the orbiter, it switched to internal battery power and used a low-power hibernation mode while it coasted for three days just before entering the Martian atmosphere.&lt;ref name="eoportal"/&gt; ''Schiaparelli'' came out of hibernation several hours before its entry, at a speed of {{convert|21000|km/h|mph|abbr=on}} and an altitude of {{convert|122.5|km|mi|abbr=on}} above the surface of Mars.&lt;ref name="eoportal"/&gt; The heat shield was used during the plunge into the atmosphere to decelerate the lander to {{convert|1650|km/h|mph|abbr=on}} by the time it reached {{convert|11|km|mi|abbr=on}} altitude.&lt;ref name="exploration.esa.int"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://exploration.esa.int/mars/47852-entry-descent-and-landing-demonstrator-module/ |title=Schiaparelli: the ExoMars Entry, Descent and Landing Demonstrator Module |publisher=European Space Agency |date= |accessdate=4 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; During entry the COMARS+ instrumentation the EDM operated to collect data on how heat and air flow around the entry capsule.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dlr.de/dlr/en/desktopdefault.aspx/tabid-10081/151_read-19721/#/gallery/24689 |title=Separate paths for ExoMars - The Schiaparelli probe will separate from its parent spacecraft on 16 October 2016 |website=Dlr.de |date=14 October 2016 |accessdate=4 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After slowing its initial entry through the atmosphere, the module deployed a parachute and was to complete its landing on [[retrorocket]]s by using a closed-loop guidance, navigation and control system based on a [[Doppler radar|Doppler radar altimeter]] sensor, and on-board [[inertial measurement unit]]s. Throughout the descent, various sensors recorded a number of atmospheric parameters and lander performance.&lt;ref name="Vago" /&gt;  The plan was that at {{convert|7|km|mi|abbr=on}} in altitude the front heat shield would be jettisoned and the radar altimeter turned on, then at {{convert|1.3|km|mi|abbr=on}} altitude above Mars the rear heat cover and parachute would be jettisoned.&lt;ref name="exploration.esa.int" /&gt;

The final stages of the landing were to be performed using pulse-firing liquid-fuel engines or [[retrorocket]]s.

The [[Opportunity (rover)|''Opportunity'' rover]] was operating in the region and the two teams worked together to attempt to image the EDM on its descent, which, depending on conditions, might have been possible especially if the EDM "went long" in its landing ellipse.

By 21 October 2016, after studying the data, ESA said it was likely that things went wrong when the parachute released early, the engines then turned on but then turned off after too short of time.&lt;ref name="swissinfo1"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-europe-space-mars-idUSKCN12L2AI |title=Europe's Mars probe destroyed after plunging to surface |agency=Reuters |first=Maria |last=Sheahan |date=21 October 2016 |accessdate=11 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Crash===
The ''Schiaparelli'' lander attempted an automated landing on 19 October 2016, but the signal was unexpectedly lost a short time before the planned landing time.&lt;ref name="ESA-20161019"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT-20161020"/&gt; ESA's ''[[Mars Express]]'' and NASA's ''[[Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter]]'' (MRO) and [[MAVEN]] continued listening for the lander's signal to no avail.&lt;ref name="ESA-20161019"/&gt;

''Schiaparelli'' transmitted about 600 megabytes of telemetry during its landing attempt,&lt;ref name="Selding"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://spacenews.com/europes-exomars-successfully-inserted-into-mars-orbit-but-lander-may-be-lost/ |title=Europe's ExoMars enters Mars orbit, but lander feared lost |work=[[SpaceNews]] |first=Peter B. |last=de Selding |date=20 October 2016 |accessdate=21 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and detailed analysis found that its atmospheric entry occurred normally, with the parachute deploying at {{convert|12|km|mi|abbr=on}} and {{convert|1730|km/h|mph|abbr=on}}, and its heat shield releasing at {{convert|7.8|km|mi|abbr=on}}. However, the lander's [[inertial measurement unit]], which measures rotation, became saturated (unable to take higher readings) for about one second. This saturation, coupled with data from the navigation computer, generated an altitude reading that was negative, or below ground level. This caused the premature release of the parachute and back shell. The braking thrusters then fired for about three seconds rather than the expected 30 seconds, followed by the activation of ground systems as if the vehicle had already landed. In reality, it was still at an altitude of {{convert|3.7|km|mi|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="esa20161123"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Space_Science/ExoMars/Schiaparelli_landing_investigation_makes_progress |title=Schiaparelli landing investigation makes progress |publisher=European Space Agency |first=Markus |last=Bauer |date=23 November 2016 |accessdate=1 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="guardian20161124"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/nov/24/mars-lander-smashed-into-ground-at-540kmh-after-misjudging-its-altitude |title=Mars lander smashed into ground at 540km/h after misjudging its altitude |work=The Guardian |agency=Agence France-Presse |date=24 November 2016 |accessdate=1 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lander continued transmitting for 19 seconds after the thrusters cut off; the loss of signal occurred 50 seconds before it was supposed to land.&lt;ref name="bbcnews20161021"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-37715202 |title=Schiaparelli Mars probe's parachute 'jettisoned too early' |work=BBC News |first=Jonathan |last=Amos |date=21 October 2016 |accessdate=21 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Schiaparelli'' impacted the Martian surface at {{convert|540|km/h|mph|abbr=on}}, near terminal velocity.&lt;ref name="guardian20161124" /&gt;

Although the lander crashed, ESA officials declared ''Schiaparelli'' a success because it had fulfilled its primary function of testing the landing system for the [[ExoMars 2020 surface platform]] and returning telemetry data during its descent.&lt;ref name="NYT-20161020"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/21/science/space/no-signal-from-mars-lander-but-european-officials-declare-mission-a-success.html |title=No Signal From Mars Lander, but European Officials Declare Mission a Success |work=[[The New York Times]] |last=Chan |first=Sewell |date=20 October 2016 |accessdate=20 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="successful"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.space.com/34471-exomars-mission-96-percent-successful-esa.html |title=ExoMars '96 Percent' Successful Despite Lander Crash: ESA |work=Space.com |last=Wall |first=Mike |date=21 October 2016 |accessdate=21 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 20 October, the bulk of the descent data had been returned to Earth and was being analysed.&lt;ref name=ESA_20_Oct_2016&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Space_Science/ExoMars/Schiaparelli_descent_data_decoding_underway |title=Schiaparelli descent data: decoding underway |publisher=European Space Agency |date=20 October 2016 |accessdate=20 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the ''[[Beagle 2]]'' lander, which was not heard from again after being released from Mars Express in 2003, the Exomars module transmitted during descent so data collected and transmitted on the way down was not lost if the spacecraft was destroyed on impact.&lt;ref name="impartialreporter.com"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/14812075.Scientists_in_nail_biting_wait_for_news_of_Mars_lander/ |title=Missing Mars lander Schiaparelli may have ditched parachute too early |work=The Impartial Reporter |date=20 October 2016 |accessdate=4 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An investigation that concluded in May 2017 revealed that, at that time, the lander deployed its parachute and then began spinning unexpectedly fast. This superfast rotation briefly saturated ''Schiaparelli''{{'s}} spin-measuring instrument, which resulted in a large attitude-estimation error by the guidance, navigation and control-system software. This resulted in the computer calculating that it was below ground level, triggering the early release of the parachute and backshell, a brief firing of the thrusters for only 3 seconds instead of 30 seconds, and the activation of the on-ground system as if ''Schiaparelli'' had landed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.space.com/37015-schiaparelli-mars-lander-crash-investigation-complete.html |title=European Mars Lander Crashed Due to Data Glitch, ESA Concludes |work=Space.com |first=Mike |last=Wall |date=27 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=SAR-2017&gt;{{cite paper |url=http://exploration.esa.int/mars/59176-exomars-2016-schiaparelli-anomaly-inquiry/ |title=ExoMars 2016 - Schiaparelli Anomaly Inquiry |publisher=European Space Agency |editor-first=Toni |editor-last=Tolker-Nielsen |date=18 May 2017 |id=DG-I/2017/546/TTN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Images of module's crash site suggested that a fuel tank may have exploded asymmetrically in the impact.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; It is reported that the lander impacted the surface at about {{convert|300|km/h|m/s mph|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/releases/esa-edm/ |title=ExoMars EDM Landing Site in Meridiani Planum |series=HiRISE |publisher=University of Arizona |date=19 October 2016 |accessdate=4 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additional imaging of the site by November further confirmed the identity of the spacecraft's parts.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Space_Science/ExoMars/Schiaparelli_crash_site_in_colour |title=Schiaparelli crash site in colour |publisher=European Space Agency |first1=Markus |last1=Bauer |first2=Thierry |last2=Blancquaert |date=3 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The additional imaging was in colour and it was noted that parachute was slightly shifted.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"/&gt;

By taking more images using a technique called super-resolution reconstruction (SRR) the resolution can be improved, and this was done for the formerly lost [[Beagle 2]] probe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/apr/26/beagle-2-most-detailed-images-yet-of-lost-mars-lander-revealed |title=Beagle 2: most detailed images yet of lost Mars lander revealed |work=The Guardian |first=Nicola |last=Davis |date=26 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two other benefits to more images is that is easier to discern between image noise such as cosmic ray hits and real objects, and among bright spots high albedo objects versus momentary specular reflections.&lt;ref name="autogenerated3"/&gt; Finally, with multiple images over time, movement and changes, such as the wind blowing a parachute can be observed.&lt;ref name="autogenerated3"/&gt;

[[File:LaRRI retroreflector on InSight (PIA22206).png|thumb|INRRI was included on the [[InSight]] Mars lander. It is seen here on InSight's deck in preparation for launch.]]

The primary mission goal was to test the landing systems, including the parachute, Doppler radar altimeter, hydrazine thrusters, etc.&lt;ref name="NASA 2016-017A"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/spacecraftDisplay.do?id=2016-017A |title=ExoMars 2016 |work=[[National Space Science Data Center]] |publisher=NASA |accessdate=23 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The secondary mission goal was scientific. The lander was to measure the wind speed and direction, humidity, pressure and surface temperature, and determine the transparency of the atmosphere.&lt;ref name="payload" /&gt;  The surface science payload was called DREAMS, and was designed to conduct meteorological data for a few days after landing,&lt;ref name="ESPC2013"/&gt; as well as measure the first measurements of atmospheric [[static electricity]] on Mars.&lt;ref name="jyi.org"/&gt;&lt;ref name="exploration.esa.int"/&gt;

INRRI was mounted to the top (zenith) side of the lander, to enable spacecraft above to target it. It weighed about 25 grams on Earth, and was contributed by the Italian Space Agency (ASI).

The lander's scientific payload for the surface was the meteorological DREAMS (Dust Characterization, Risk Assessment, and Environment Analyser on the Martian Surface) package, consisting of a suite of sensors to measure the wind speed and direction (MetWind), humidity (MetHumi), pressure (MetBaro), surface temperature (MarsTem), the transparency of the atmosphere (Solar Irradiance Sensor - SIS), and atmospheric electrification (Atmospheric Relaxation and Electric-field Sensor - Micro-ARES).&lt;ref name="ESPC2013"&gt;F.

The DREAMS payload was intended to function for 2 to 8 Mars days as an environmental station for the duration of the surface mission after landing.&lt;ref name="EDL-demonstrator-module"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Vago/&gt; The planned lander arrival was made to coincide with the Mars global dust storm season and collect data on a dust-loaded Mars atmosphere.&lt;ref name="payload" /&gt; DREAMS had been hoped to provide new insights into the role of electric forces on dust lifting, the mechanism that initiates dust storms. In addition, the MetHumi sensor was intended to complement MicroARES measurements with critical data about humidity, to enable scientists to better understand the dust electrification process.&lt;ref name=DREAMS/&gt;

[[Atmospheric electricity]] on Mars is still unmeasured, and its possible role in dust storms and atmospheric chemistry remains unknown. It has been speculated that atmospheric static electricity may have played a role in the inconclusive results from the [[Viking lander biological experiments|''Viking'' lander life experiments]], which were positive for metabolizing microbial life, but no organic compounds were detected by the mass spectrometer.&lt;ref name="nasa.gov"/&gt; The two favored possible explanations are reactions with hydrogen peroxide ([[Hydrogen peroxide|{{chem2|O2H2}}]]) or ozone ([[Ozone|{{chem2|O3}}]]) created by ultraviolet light or atmospheric electrical processes during dust storms.&lt;ref name="nasa.gov"/&gt;

DREAMS-P was a pressure sensor and DREAMS-H was for humidity;the sensors feed a single data-handling circuit board.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://spaceflight101.com/exomars/schiaparelli-instrument-overview/ |title=Schiaparelli Instrument Overview – ExoMars |website=Spaceflight101.com |date= |accessdate=4 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the surface payload, a camera called DECA (Descent Camera) on the lander operated during the descent. It was intended to deliver additional context information and exact location data in the form of images.&lt;ref name="AMELIA"&gt;{{citation |first1=F. |last1=Ferri |first2=F. |last2=Forget |first3=S.R. |last3=Lewis |first4=O. |last4=Karatekin |contribution=ExoMars Atmospheric Mars Entry and Landing Investigations and Analysis (AMELIA) |title=ExoMars Entry, Descent and Landing Science |place=Toulouse, France |date=16–22 June 2012 |contribution-url=http://websites.isae.fr/sites/websites/IMG/pdf/exomars_edls_science_fferri_ippw9.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131023060426/http://websites.isae.fr/sites/websites/IMG/pdf/exomars_edls_science_fferri_ippw9.pdf |archivedate=23 October 2013 |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; DECA is a reflight of the Visual Monitoring Camera (VMC) of the [[Planck (spacecraft)|Planck]] and [[Herschel Space Observatory|Herschel]] mission.&lt;ref name="ESA camera"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Space_Science/ExoMars/What_to_expect_from_Schiaparelli_s_camera |title=What to expect from Schiaparelli's camera |publisher=European Space Agency |accessdate=22 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another surface experiment that was focused on dust was the [[Materials Adherence Experiment]] on the [[Mars Pathfinder]] lander, about twenty years prior to ExoMars.

===Descent Camera===
The Descent Camera (DECA) was intended to capture about 15 downward-looking views as it approached the surface of Mars.&lt;ref name="ESA camera"/&gt; It was to begin acquiring images after the lower heat shield was ejected.&lt;ref name="autogenerated4"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://exploration.esa.int/mars/54333-deca-the-descent-camera-on-schiaparelli/ |title=DECA – the descent camera on Schiaparelli |publisher=European Space Agency |date= |accessdate=4 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This camera had a 60 degree field of view to capture [[greyscale]] images, to support technical knowledge of the descent.&lt;ref name="ESA camera"/&gt; DECA was a flight spare of the visual monitoring camera of the [[Herschel Space Observatory]] and Plank mission that were launched together. The camera dimensions are {{convert|9|cm|in|abbr=on}} squared, with a mass of {{convert|0.6|kg|lb|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="edm-science-payload" /&gt; The DECA descent camera data were stored during descent and not meant to be relayed to Earth until after landing,&lt;ref name="eoportal"/&gt; so these images were lost in the crash. The purpose of this transfer delay was to protect the spacecraft and data from electrostatic discharges.&lt;ref name="autogenerated4"/&gt; DECA was designed and built in Belgium by ''Optique et Instruments de Précision'' (OIP).&lt;ref name="eoportal"/&gt;

The main goals for DECA included:&lt;ref name="eoportal"/&gt;
*image [[landing area]]
*measure transparency of the Martian atmosphere,
*collect data for 3-D [[topography]] of landing area

===Preliminary results===
Because the ''Schiarapelli'' demonstrator lander transmitted ''during'' its descent, a great deal of telemetry was successfully returned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author= |url=http://www.planetary.org/blogs/guest-blogs/2016/1020-exomars-schiaparelli-analysis-to-continue.html |title=ExoMars: Schiaparelli Analysis to Continue |publisher=The Planetary Society |date= |accessdate=4 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; About 600 megabytes&lt;ref name="Selding"/&gt; of data, amounting to about 80% of telemetry, were relayed to Earth and are being used to investigate the failure modes of the landing technology employed.&lt;ref name="successful"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Space_Science/ExoMars/Mars_Reconnaissance_Orbiter_views_Schiaparelli_landing_site |title=Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter views Schiaparelli landing site |publisher=European Space Agency |date=21 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Clark |first=Stephen |url=https://spaceflightnow.com/2016/10/21/mars-orbiter-locates-schiaparelli-landers-crash-site/ |title=Mars orbiter locates Schiaparelli lander's crash site |work=Spaceflight Now |date=31 October 2016 |accessdate=2 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Power systems===
At one point, Roscosmos offered to contribute a 100 watt [[radioisotope thermoelectric generator]] (RTG) power source for the EDM lander to allow it to monitor the local surface environment for a full Martian year,&lt;ref name="still keen"&gt;{{cite news |first=Jonathan |last=Amos |title=Europe still keen on Mars missions |date=15 March 2012 |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-17390576 |work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Feb 14"&gt;{{cite news |first=Frank |last=Morring, Jr. |title=NASA Units Hope For Robotic Mars Mission In 2018 |date=14 February 2012 |url=http://www.aviationweek.com/Article.aspx?id=/article-xml/asd_02_14_2012_p01-02-424988.xml |work=Aviation Week}}&lt;/ref&gt; but because of complex Russian export control procedures, it later opted for the use of a non-rechargeable electric battery with enough power for 2 to 8 [[Martian day|sols]].&lt;ref name="edm-science-payload"/&gt;&lt;ref name="RTG"&gt;{{cite news |first=Peter B. |last=de Selding |title=Russian Export Rules Force ExoMars Mission Changes |date=5 October 2012 |url=http://www.spacenews.com/article/russian-export-rules-force-exomars-mission-changes |work=Space News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Solar panels were also considered when a longer mission (1–2 months) supported by a heavier, more complex, lander was under consideration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://futureplanets.blogspot.com/2011/06/goals-of-esas-mars-demonstration-lander.html |title=Goals of ESA's Mars Demonstration Lander |work=Future Planetary Exploration |first=Van |last=Kane |date=14 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the 2010s the focus was on executing a short-lived (a few days surface time) technology demonstration, with an emphasis on landing systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://futureplanets.blogspot.com/2011/06/goals-of-esas-mars-demonstration-lander.html |title=Goals of ESA's Mars Demonstration Lander |work=Future Planetary Exploration |date=14 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Communication systems and network===
''Schiaparelli'' had a [[UHF]] radio to communicate with Mars orbiters.&lt;ref name="Listening" /&gt; The lander had two antennae, one on the back shell and one on the lander.&lt;ref name="Listening"/&gt; When the back shell is ejected, it can transmit from the spiral antenna on body of the lander.&lt;ref name="Listening"/&gt; The ExoMars TGO could also communicate with it using the UHF system.&lt;ref name="Listening"/&gt; When an orbiter can communicate with the lander depends on where it is in its orbit, and not all orbiters could record or talk with lander because the globe of Mars blocks the [[Line-of-sight propagation|line of sight]] to the lander.&lt;ref name="Listening"/&gt; The ExoMars TGO could also communicate with it using the UHF system.&lt;ref name="Listening"/&gt; The EDM "woke up" from hibernation about 90 minutes prior to landing, and transmitted continuously for 15 minutes prior to landing.&lt;ref name="Listening"/&gt;

During its landing, the EDM signal was monitored at Mars by the ''[[Mars Express]]'' orbiter, and remotely by the [[Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope]] in Pune, India.&lt;ref name="Listening"/&gt; ''Mars Express'' also communicates with other landers and rovers using its Melacom communication system.&lt;ref name="Listening"/&gt; The ''[[Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter]]'' (MRO) overflew the landing two hours after landing, and was available to check for signals from ''Schiaparelli''.&lt;ref name="Listening"/&gt; The ExoMars TGO could also communicate with it using the UHF system.&lt;ref name="Listening"/&gt;

The communication system standard at Mars is the [[Electra (radio)|Electra]] radio, in use since the arrival of the ''Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter'' in 2006. Prior to this, several orbiters used a first generation UHF relay system, including ''Mars Global Surveyor'', ''Mars Odyssey'', and ''Mars Express''.&lt;ref name="Listening"/&gt; Using orbiters to relay data from Mars landers and rovers is noted for its energy efficiency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?feature=1230 |title=NASA's Newest Mars Orbiter Passes Communications Relay Test |publisher=NASA |first=Guy |last=Webster |date=17 November 2006 |accessdate=23 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 19 October 2016 it took 9 minutes and 47 seconds for a radio transmission to travel at roughly the speed of light from Mars to Earth.&lt;ref name="blogs.esa.int"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blogs.esa.int/rocketscience/2016/10/18/listening-to-an-alien-landing/ |title=Listening to an alien landing |publisher=European Space Agency |first=Thomas |last=Ormston |date=18 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; So even though the radio array at Pune listened in "real time", the entire EDL sequence, which would take about 6 minutes, had already occurred even as it was being recorded as starting to enter the atmosphere.&lt;ref name="blogs.esa.int"/&gt; There is a tiny bit of variation because the speed of light is slowed down by the air of Mars and Earth (see [[Refractive index]]), and another factor is [[Time dilation]], because the probe existed at a significantly different velocity and in a different gravitational field the radio station back on Earth (though relatively small).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/physics/Relativity/SpeedOfLight/speed_of_light.html |title=Is The Speed of Light Everywhere the Same? |publisher=University of California, Riverside |first1=Philip |last1=Gibbs |first2=Steve |last2=Carlip |first3=Don |last3=Koks |date=2014 |orig-year=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=HSWTime&gt;{{cite web |last=Toothman |first=Jessika |url=http://science.howstuffworks.com/humans-age-in-space.htm |work=[[HowStuffWorks]] |title=How Do Humans age in space? |accessdate=24 April 2012|date=2010-09-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=EdLu&gt;{{cite web |last=Lu |first=Ed |url=http://spaceflight.nasa.gov/station/crew/exp7/luletters/lu_letter13.html |work=Ed's Musing from Space |publisher=[[NASA]] |title=Expedition 7 &amp;ndash; Relativity |accessdate=24 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Computing===
The ''Schiaparelli'' lander has two main computers, one is called the Central Terminal &amp; Power Unit (CTPU) and housed in a warm box on top, and the other computer is called the Remote Terminal &amp; Power Unit (RTPU)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.terma.com/press/news-2016/terma-unit-involved-in-mission-critical-descent-on-mars/ |title=Terma unit involved in mission critical descent on Mars |website=www.terma.com |access-date=20 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is on the underside of the lander.&lt;ref name="Spaceflight 101"&gt;[http://spaceflight101.com/exomars/schiaparelli-edm/ "Schiaparelli Mars Lander (EDM)".] ''Spaceflight101.com''. Retrieved: 27 October 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, the CTPU handles surface operations and the RTPU handles entry and descent, and is actually destroyed on final landing with surface because it is on the underside.&lt;ref name="Spaceflight 101"/&gt; When the Trace Gas Orbiter and Entry Demonstrator Module are connected, the RTPU handles the interface and sends power from the orbiter to the module.&lt;ref name="Spaceflight 101"/&gt; When it disconnects from the orbiter, then it must run off its internal batteries.&lt;ref name="Spaceflight 101"/&gt; The CTPU uses a [[LEON]] central processor, and also has RAM, PROM, and a timer.&lt;ref name="Spaceflight 101"/&gt; The CTPU also handles data sent to the UHF radio communication system.&lt;ref name="Spaceflight 101"/&gt; When the lander disconnects from the orbiter, it spends most of its time in a low-power hibernation mode while it coasts through space before entering the Martian atmosphere.&lt;ref name="eoportal"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://directory.eoportal.org/web/eoportal/satellite-missions/e/exomars |title=ExoMars |work=eoPortal |publisher=European Space Agency |accessdate=4 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lander must coast through space for about 3 days by itself before landing, meanwhile the orbiter has to do a Mars orbit insertion.&lt;ref name="eoportal"/&gt; The DECA descent camera data is not downloaded to the computer for relay to Earth until after landing, and it is not transmitted during descent.&lt;ref name="eoportal"/&gt;

===Parachute===
A disk-band-gap parachute was deployed by a pyrotechnic mortar.&lt;ref name="russianspaceweb.com"/&gt; It was tested at full scale in the largest wind tunnel in the world as part of its development.&lt;ref name="russianspaceweb.com"/&gt; A sub-scale parachute was tested in Earth's atmosphere was conducted in 2011; it was ascended by balloon to 24.5 kilometers altitude and then released, and the pyrotechnic deployment systems was tested after a period of free-fall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://exploration.esa.int/mars/49135-edm-parachute-system-tests/ |title=EDM parachute system tests |publisher=European Space Agency |date= |accessdate=4 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 19 October 2016 the parachute was successfully deployed on Mars.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;

===Retro-rockets===
''Schiaparelli'' module has 3 sets of three thrusters, nine total, that operate starting at about 1&amp;nbsp;km (half a mile) up in pulse mode, slowing the spacecraft from {{convert|70|to|4|m/s|km/h|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://exploration.esa.int/mars/58425-preparing-to-land-on-mars/ |title=Preparing to land on Mars |publisher=European Space Agency |date=27 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each of the nine engines is a CHT-400 rocket engine that can produce 400 Newtons of thrust.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; These rocket engines are fueled by three spherical 17.5 liter tanks holding hydrazine propellant.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="rsw-exo16"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.russianspaceweb.com/exomars2016-edm.html |title=Schiaparelli to make Europe's second Mars landing attempt |website=Russianspaceweb.com |first=Anatoly |last=Zak |date=22 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tanks hold  about 15–16 kilograms of hydrazine (about 34 pounds, 2.4 stones) of fuel per tank, or 46&amp;nbsp;kg overall (101 pounds or 7.24 stones).&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="rsw-exo16"/&gt; The propellant is pressurized by helium, held in a single tank containing 15.6 liters at a pressure of 170 bar (2465 psi).&lt;ref name="rsw-exo16"/&gt; The thrusters shut down 1–2 meters/yards from the surface, after which the crumple zone underneath the lander handles the final stop.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Data from a timer, [[doppler radar]], and inertial measurement unit are merged in the lander's computers to control the operation of the thrusters.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

==Impact on ExoMars==
A possible "shutdown" moment for the next ExoMars mission was the ESA ministerial meeting in December 2016 which considered certain issues including €300 million of ExoMars funding and lessons learned from the ExoMars 2016 missions so far.&lt;ref name="sciencemag.org"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2016/10/mars-lander-crash-complicates-follow-rover-2020 |title=Mars lander crash complicates follow-up rover in 2020 |work=[[Science (magazine)|Science]] |first=Daniel |last=Clery |date=25 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; One concern is the ''Schiapraelli'' module crash, as this landing system is being produced in near duplication for the ExoMars 2020 mission consisting of the [[ExoMars (rover)|ExoMars rover]] delivered by the instrumented [[ExoMars 2020 surface platform]].&lt;ref name="sciencemag.org"/&gt; The ExoMars team has been praised for "putting a brave face" on what happened and being positive about the EDM's very credible return on its prime mission: data about entry, descent, and landing, despite the difficulties on final landing.&lt;ref name="airspacemag.com"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.airspacemag.com/daily-planet/europes-first-landing-mars-180960828/ |title=ExoMars Lander Goes Silent at the Last Minute |work=[[Air &amp; Space/Smithsonian]] |first=Tony |last=Reichhardt |date=20 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, there was the successful insertion of the TGO into Mars orbit with its large science payload.&lt;ref name="airspacemag.com"/&gt; Another positive was the development of the demonstrator module as part of the overall grand plan for ExoMars, which meant that the landing technologies underwent a real-world test before carrying more valuable cargo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.space.com/11954-nasa-mars-mission-2016-experiments-europe.html |title=Robot Mars Lander Gets Experiments for 2016 Mission |work=Space.com |date=13 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Just as the EDM itself was tested on Earth to gain knowledge about how it would perform on Mars, the EDM is also a test for future missions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://exploration.esa.int/mars/50108-exomars-edm-landing-system-tests/ |title=ExoMars EDM landing system drop tests |publisher=European Space Agency |date=20 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Study of what happened is critical, as significant breakthroughs in understanding can impact the lessons learned from a mission, which in turn effects public opinion, technology, future mission design, and even the feelings of everyone involved.&lt;ref name="bbc.com"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-37940445 |title=Beagle 2 'was so close to Mars success' |work=BBC News |date=11 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, ''Beagle 2'' Mars lander was suspected to have undergone a high velocity impact with Mars in 2003, but when it was found on Mars intact with its panels partly deployed the EDL design was validated{{mdash}}but only after more than a decade.&lt;ref name="bbc.com"/&gt; The lead developer did suffer heavy criticism and even ridicule for this failure, eventually dying from a brain hemorrhage in 2014, just a year before his spacecraft was found intact.&lt;ref name="bbc.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/professor-colin-pillinger-obituary-scientist-who-became-the-public-face-of-beagle-2-the-unsuccessful-9342434.html |title=Professor Colin Pillinger obituary: Scientist who became the public face of ‘Beagle 2’, the unsuccessful British mission to land a spacecraft on Mars |work=[[The Independent]] |first=Martin |last=Childs |date=9 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A preliminary report on the malfunction was presented at the December 2016 ESA ministerial meeting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Amos |first=Jonathan |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-37898565 |title=Key meeting to weigh Mars crash report |work=BBC News |date=7 November 2016 |accessdate=7 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; By December the outcome was known: ExoMars would go on being financially supported by the ESA.&lt;ref name="natureworldnews.com"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.natureworldnews.com/articles/33592/20161207/exomars-rover-gets-funding-despite-schiaparelli-mars-lander-crash.htm |title=ExoMars Rover Gets Funding Despite Schiaparelli Mars Lander Crash |work=Nature World News |first=Alixandra Caole |last=Vila |date=7 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; €436 million ($464 million) was authorized to finish the mission.&lt;ref name="natureworldnews.com" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://eandt.theiet.org/content/articles/2016/12/esa-states-approves-exomars-funding-despite-crash/ |title=ESA states approve ExoMars funding despite crash |work=Engineering and Technology |date=2 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Space weathering''' is the type of weathering that occurs to any object exposed to the harsh environment of [[outer space]].  Bodies without atmospheres (including the [[Moon]], [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]], the [[asteroids]], [[comets]], and most of the moons of other planets) take on many weathering processes:
* collisions of [[galactic cosmic ray]]s and [[solar cosmic ray]]s,
* [[irradiation]], implantation, and [[sputtering]] from [[solar wind]] particles, and
* bombardment by different sizes of [[meteorites]] and [[micrometeorites]].
Space weathering is important because these processes affect the physical and [[optical properties]] of the surface of many planetary bodies.  Therefore, it is critical to understand the effects of space weathering in order to properly interpret remotely sensed data.

[[File:Weatheringcartoon.jpg|thumb|right|300px|An illustration of space weathering's different components.]]

== History ==

Much of our knowledge of the space weathering process comes from studies of the lunar samples returned by the [[Apollo program]], particularly the [[lunar soil]]s (or [[regolith]]).  The constant flux of [[high energy particles]] and [[micrometeorites]], along with larger meteorites, act to [[Comminution|comminute]], melt, [[sputter]] and [[vaporize]] components of the lunar soil.

The first products of space weathering that were recognized in lunar soils were "agglutinates".  These are created when micrometeorites melt a small amount of material, which incorporates surrounding glass and mineral fragments into a glass-welded aggregate ranging in size from a few micrometers to a few millimeters.  Agglutinates are very common in lunar soil, accounting for as much as 60 to 70% of mature soils.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Heiken|first=Grant|title=Lunar sourcebook : a user's guide to the moon|date=1991|publisher=Cambridge Univ. Press|location=Cambridge [u.a.]|isbn=978-0-521-33444-0|edition=1. publ.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These complex and irregularly-shaped particles appear black to the human eye, largely due to the presence of [[Nanophase material|nanophase]] [[iron]].

Space weathering also produces surface-correlated products on individual soil grains, such as glass splashes; implanted [[hydrogen]], [[helium]] and other gases; [[solar flare]] tracks; and accreted components, including nanophase iron.  It wasn't until the 1990s that improved instruments, in particular [[transmission electron microscope]]s, and techniques allowed for the discovery of very thin (60-200&amp;nbsp;nm) [[patina]]s, or rims, which develop on individual lunar soil grains as a result of the redepositing of vapor from nearby micrometeorite impacts and the redeposition of material sputtered from nearby grains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal
|last1= Keller |first1= L. P |last2= McKay  |first2= D. S.
|date=June 1997 |title= The nature and origin of rims on lunar soil grains |journal= Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta |volume= 61 |issue= 11 |pages= 2331–2341
|doi=10.1016/S0016-7037(97)00085-9
|bibcode = 1997GeCoA..61.2331K }}&lt;/ref&gt;

These weathering processes have large effects on the spectral properties of lunar soil, particularly in the [[ultraviolet]], [[Visible wavelength|visible]], and [[near infrared]] (UV/Vis/NIR) [[wavelengths]]. These spectral changes have largely been attributed to the inclusions of "nanophase iron" which is a ubiquitous component of both agglutinates and soil rims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Noble|first=Sarah|author2=Pieters C. M. |author3=Keller L. P. |title=An experimental approach to understanding the optical effects of space weathering|journal=Icarus|date=September 2007|volume=192|pages=629–642|bibcode = 2007Icar..192..629N |doi = 10.1016/j.icarus.2007.07.021 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These very small (one to a few hundred nanometers in diameter) blebs of metallic iron are created when iron-bearing minerals (e.g. [[olivine]] and [[pyroxene]]) are vaporized and the iron is liberated and redeposited in its native form.
[[File:Weatheredrim.jpg|thumb|right|350px|TEM image of space weathered rim on a grain of lunar soil 10084]]

== Effects on spectral properties ==

On the Moon, the spectral effects of space weathering are threefold: as the lunar surface matures it becomes darker (the [[albedo]] is reduced), redder (reflectance increases with increasing wavelength), and the depth of its diagnostic [[absorption band]]s are reduced&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Pieters |first1= C. M. |last2= Fischer |first2= E. M. |last3= Rode |first3= O. |last4= Basu |first4= A. |date= 1993 |title= Optical Effects of Space Weathering: The Role of the Finest Fraction |journal= Journal of Geophysical Research |volume= 98 |issue= E11 |pages= 20,817–20,824 |doi= 10.1029/93JE02467 |issn= 0148-0227 |bibcode = 1993JGR....9820817P }}&lt;/ref&gt;  These effects are largely due to the presence of [[Nanophase material|nanophase]] iron in both the agglutinates and in the accreted rims on individual grains.  The darkening effects of space weathering are readily seen by studying lunar craters.  Young, fresh craters have bright [[ray system]]s, because they have exposed fresh, unweathered material, but over time those rays disappear as the weathering process darkens the material.

== Space weathering on asteroids ==

Space weathering is also thought to occur on asteroids,&lt;ref&gt;For a thorough review of the current state of understanding of space weathering on Asteroids, see  {{cite journal |last= Chapman |first= Clark R. |date=May 2004 |title= Space Weathering of Asteroid Surfaces |journal= Annual Review of Earth and Planetary Sciences |volume= 32 |pages= 539–567 |doi= 10.1146/annurev.earth.32.101802.120453|bibcode = 2004AREPS..32..539C }}.&lt;/ref&gt; though the environment is quite different from the Moon. Impacts in the asteroid belt are slower, and therefore create less melt and vapor.  Also, fewer solar wind particles reach the asteroid belt.  And finally, the higher rate of impactors and lower gravity of the smaller bodies means that there is more overturn and the surface exposure ages should be younger than the [[lunar surface]].  Therefore, space weathering should occur more slowly and to a lesser degree on the surfaces of asteroids.

However, we do see evidence for asteroidal space weathering.  For years there had been a so-called "conundrum" in the planetary science community because, in general, the spectra of asteroids do not match the spectra of our collection of meteorites. Particularly, the spectra of [[S-type asteroid]]s, did not match the spectra of the most abundant type of meteorites, [[ordinary chondrite]]s (OCs). The asteroid spectra tended to be redder with a steep curvature in the visible wavelengths. However, Binzel et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Binzel |first1= R.P. |last2= Bus |first2= S.J. |last3= Burbine |first3= T.H. |last4= Sunshine |first4= J.M. |date=Aug 1996 |title= Spectral Properties of Near-Earth Asteroids: Evidence for Sources of Ordinary Chondrite Meteorites |journal= Science |volume= 273 |issue= 5277 |pages= 946–948 |doi= 10.1126/science.273.5277.946 |pmid= 8688076|bibcode = 1996Sci...273..946B }}&lt;/ref&gt; have identified near Earth asteroids with spectral properties covering the range from S-type to spectra similar to those of OC meteorites, suggesting an ongoing process is occurring that can alter the spectra of OC material to look like S-type asteroids. There is also evidence of regolith alteration from [[Galileo]]'s flybys of [[951 Gaspra|Gaspra]] and [[243 Ida|Ida]] showing spectral differences at fresh craters. With time, the spectra of Ida and Gaspra appear to redden and lose spectral contrast. Evidence from [[NEAR Shoemaker]]'s x-ray measurements of [[433 Eros|Eros]] indicate an ordinary chondrite composition despite a red-sloped, S-type spectrum, again suggesting that some process has altered the optical properties of the surface. 
Results from the [[Hayabusa]] spacecraft at the asteroid [[25143 Itokawa|Itokawa]], also ordinary chondrite in composition, shows spectral evidence of space weathering.  In addition, definitive evidence of space weathering alteration has been identified in the grains of soil returned by the Hayabusa spacecraft.  Because Itokawa is so small (550 m diameter), it was thought that the low gravity would not allow for the development of a mature regolith, however, preliminary examination of the returned samples reveals the presence of nanophase iron and other space weathering effects on several grains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |display-authors=8|author=T. Noguchi|author2=T. Nakamura|author3=M. Kimura|author4=M. E. Zolensky|author5=M. Tanaka|author6=T. Hashimoto|author7=M. Konno|author8=A. Nakato|author9=T. Ogami|author10=A. Fujimura|author11=M.

Such coatings are likely similar to the patinas found on lunar rocks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hiroi|first=Takahiro|author2=Abe M. |author3=K. Kitazato |author4=S. Abe |author5=B.

There is evidence to suggest most of the color change due to weathering occurs rapidly, in the first hundred thousands years, limiting the usefulness of spectral measurement for determining the age of asteroids.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Sun damage conceals asteroids' true ages |author=Rachel Courtland |work=[[New Scientist]] |date=30 April 2009 |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn17062-sun-damage-conceals-asteroids-true-ages.html |accessdate=27 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Space weathering on Mercury ==

The environment at [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]] also differs substantially from the Moon.  For one thing, it is significantly hotter in the day ([[Diurnal cycle|diurnal]] surface temperature ~100&amp;nbsp;°C for the Moon, ~425&amp;nbsp;°C on Mercury) and colder at night, which may alter the products of space weathering. In addition, because of its location in the Solar System, Mercury is also subjected to a slightly larger flux of micrometeorites that impact at much higher velocities than the Moon. These factors combine to make Mercury much more efficient than the Moon at creating both melt and vapor.  Per unit area, impacts on Mercury are expected to produce 13.5x the melt and 19.5x the vapor than is produced on the Moon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Cintala |first= Mark J. |date=Jan 1992 |title= Impact-Induced Thermal Effects in the Lunar and Mercurian Regoliths |journal= Journal of Geophysical Research |volume= 97 |issue= E1 |pages= 947–973 |issn= 0148-0227 |doi= 10.1029/91JE02207|bibcode = 1992JGR....97..947C }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Agglutinitic glass-like deposits and vapor-deposited coatings should be created significantly faster and more efficiently on Mercury than on the Moon.

The UV/Vis spectrum of Mercury, as observed telescopically from Earth, is roughly linear, with a red slope.  There are no absorption bands related to Fe-bearing minerals, such as pyroxene.  This means that either there is no iron on the surface of Mercury, or else the iron in the Fe-bearing minerals has been weathered to nanophase iron.  A weathered surface would then explain the reddened slope.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Hapke |first= Bruce |date=Feb 2001 |title= Space Weathering from Mercury to the asteroid belt |journal= Journal of Geophysical Research |volume= 106 |issue= E5 |pages= 10,039–10,073 |doi= 10.1029/2000JE001338|bibcode = 2001JGR...10610039H }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Stuhrling Tourbillon Movement.ogv|thumb|280px|Tourbillon Movement ([[:File:Stuhrling Tourbillon Movement.ogv|high resolution]]).]]

In [[horology]], a '''tourbillon''' ({{IPAc-en|t|ʊər|ˈ|b|ɪ|l|j|ən}}; {{IPA-fr|tuʁbijɔ̃|lang}} "[[whirlwind]]") is an addition to the mechanics of a watch [[escapement]].  Developed around 1795 and patented by the French-Swiss watchmaker [[Abraham-Louis Breguet]] on June 26, 1801, a tourbillon aims to counter the effects of [[gravity]] by mounting the [[escapement]] and [[balance wheel]] in a rotating cage, to negate the effect of gravity when the timepiece (thus the escapement) is stuck in a certain position.  By continuously rotating the entire balance wheel/escapement assembly at a slow rate (typically about one revolution per minute), the tourbillon averages out positional errors.

Originally an attempt to improve accuracy, tourbillons are still included in some expensive modern watches as a novelty and demonstration of watchmaking virtuosity.  The mechanism is usually exposed on the watch's face to show it off.

==Mechanics of the tourbillon==
[[File:Breguet MG 2573.jpg|thumb|A [[Breguet (watch)|Breguet]] squelette watch 2933 with tourbillon ]]
[[Image:Tourbillon.jpg|thumb|left|200px|An assembled tourbillon, clearly showing balance wheel, pallet fork and escape wheel.]]

Gravity directly affects the most delicate parts of the escapement, namely the [[pallet fork]], balance wheel and [[hairspring]]. Most important is the hairspring, which functions as the [[wiktionary:regulator|timing regulator]] for the escapement and is thus the part most sensitive to exterior effects, such as [[magnetism]], shocks, temperature, as well as inner effects such as pinning positions (inner collet), terminal curve, and heavy points on the balance wheel. 

Many inventions have been developed to counteract these problems. Temperature and magnetism problems have been eliminated with [[Elinvar|new materials]]. Shocks have much less effect today than at Breguet's time thanks to [[resilience (materials science)|stronger and more resilient]] materials. The oscillator still gets disturbed at the moment of the shock, but the hairspring is not as easily deformed from shocks as before, and re-stabilizes itself quickly after such an event.{{citation needed|reason=These statements needs a reliable source; it is not self-evident that modern materials are more resilient than those used in Breguet's time, or that the hairspring does not get as easily deformed from shocks as before.|date=April 2015}}

Gravity comes into play on the remaining effects. One of them is easily taken away, namely heavy points on the balance wheel. This leaves pinning point and terminal curve. Both of these add a lot of variation to the regulation of a watch; assembly, regulation adjustments by the watchmaker, positioning in the watch, and later position changes by the owner.  As the balance wheel goes from one extreme position to the other in its swing back and forth, the hairspring's coils extend and contract a great deal, leading to problems that are extremely hard to counteract. Some have tried using hairsprings that are cylindrical or even spherical instead of flat as is prominent today. Some variations of Breguet's overcoil have been developed to counteract the effects of the terminal curve.  As for the pinning point, Grossmann, Berthoud, Breguet, Caspari and Leroy&lt;ref&gt;Reymondin, Charles-André et al., ''The Theory of Horology'', Switzerland: Swiss Federation of Technical Colleges (FET) [and] the Watchmakers of Switzerland Training and Educational Program Neuchâtel in collaboration with GREME, 1999 (2nd ed., 2005). {{ISBN|978-2-940025-12-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; tried many different possibilities, but not much improvement was gained.

The biggest obstacle to regulating a watch, even today, is getting a constant impulse from the escapement regardless of its spatial orientation. This has been made much easier with accurate timing instruments which give instantaneous results, whereas in Breguet's time all that watchmakers had was another watch to regulate from.  So, results were not very exact and it could take weeks to get them.  Effects of gravity on an escapement can have quite significant effects with slight variations of position.  Even if a pocket watch was kept most of the time in a breast pocket, the exact position could still vary over 45°. Watchmakers can regulate a watch in up to eight positions: dial up, crown down, dial down, crown left, crown up, crown right, half-way position crown up, and half-way position crown down.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Watch Accuracy|url=https://www.prestigetime.com/page.php?accuracy|website=PrestigeTime.com|publisher=Prestige Time, LLC|accessdate=16 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A tourbillon quite neatly reduces this problem; it only needs to be regulated for three positions; the two horizontal positions, dial up &amp; down, and one vertical position.

[[Image:Greubel Forsey DT30 mechanism.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Greubel Forsey]] Double Tourbillon 30° mechanism.]]

Even with new materials and improved theories, it is impossible to regulate a mechanical watch so it keeps the same time in all positions.  A tourbillon offers watchmakers the possibility of higher accuracy than conventional movements, although poising the balance well and ensuring that the balance spring expands and contracts symmetrically can achieve nearly the same result. A tourbillon typically makes one complete revolution per minute. This improves timekeeping in the four vertical positions because even if a watch is stationary in a random vertical position, the tourbillon makes the escapement turn around its own axis, effectively cancelling the effect of gravity by turning the balance through all possible vertical positions during its rotation. A normal tourbillon has no effect in horizontal positions, since the horizontal balance is  not affected by gravity as it turns.

A tourbillon has no effect on the change in rate that accompanies a change in attitude from dial horizontal (dial up or down) to dial vertical (pendant up, down, left or right). The change in rate between horizontal and vertical is much greater than rate changes between different vertical positions. Breguet designed the tourbillon for pocket watches that are kept in a vertical position in the waistcoat pocket, and can be maintained in this vertical position overnight by hanging on a suitable stand. In this attitude a tourbillon is effective. However, the attitude of a wristwatch changes frequently from vertical to horizontal depending on the wearer's hand movement. The effect of a tourbillon is small compared to the change in rate resulting from changes from vertical to horizontal, and vice versa. Inclined tourbillons such as those made by [[Greubel Forsey]] are an improvement in this regard.

Mechanical watches are now purchased by those who value craftsmanship and aesthetics over very accurate timing.  Most tourbillons use standard Swiss [[lever escapement]]s, but some have a [[Escapement#Detent escapement|detent escapement]].

The tourbillon is considered to be one of the most challenging of watch mechanisms to make&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | publisher = Europa Star | title=The tourbillon |author=Jean-Claude Nicolet |url= http://www.europastar.com/europastar/watch_tech/tourbillon.jsp| accessdate=1 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The assembling and testing of a tourbillon watch| publisher = My Tourbillon | url= http://mytourbillon.com/the-assembling-and-testing-of-a-tourbillon-watch/|accessdate=1 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; (although technically not a [[complication (horology)|complication]] itself) and is valued for its engineering and design principles.  The first production tourbillon mechanism was produced by Breguet for [[Napoleon Bonaparte|Napoleon]] in one of his [[carriage clock]]s (travel clocks of the time were of considerable weight, typically weighing almost 200 pounds).

==Types of tourbillon==

===Double-axis tourbillon===
[[File:Double axis tourb.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Anthony Randall's double axis tourbillon as installed in a carriage clock.]]

Anthony Randall invented the double-axis tourbillon in January 1977 and subsequently patented it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent |country-code=GB | patent-number =2027232A |inventor-last= Randall |inventor-first = Anthony George |title=Timepiece with tourbillion |issue-date= 13 February 1980 | publication-date =3 August 1978}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Randall | first=Anthony G.|date= September 1981|title = The Double Axis Tourbillon|journal=Horological Journal|publisher = British Horological Institute |volume= 124|issue= 3| pages= 12–14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first working example was later constructed by Richard Good in 1978.  In 1980 Anthony Randall made a double-axis tourbillon in a carriage clock, which was located in the (now closed) Time Museum in Rockford, Illinois, US, and was included in their ''Catalogue of Chronometers''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Randall| first = Anthony G. | title = Time Museum Catalogue of Chronometers| edition= 1st | year = 1992 | publisher=The Time Museum | place = Rockford, Illinois |isbn = 978-0-91294703-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, inspired by this invention, the young German watchmaker Thomas Prescher developed for the Thomas Prescher Haute Horlogerie the first flying double-axis tourbillon in a pocket watch and, in 2004, the first flying double-axis tourbillon with constant force in the carriage in a wristwatch. Shown at the Baselworld 2003 and 2004 in Basel, Switzerland.

A characteristic of this tourbillon is that it turns around two axes, both of which rotate once per minute.  The whole tourbillon is powered by a special constant-force mechanism, called a ''[[remontoire]]''.&lt;ref name = "Daniel"&gt;{{Citation | first = George | last = Daniel | title = Watchmaking | publisher = Sotheby's | year = 1985 | ISBN = 978-0-85667-497-6 | at = S. 264}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Thomas Prescher invented the constant-force mechanism to equalize the effects of a wound and unwound [[mainspring]], friction, and gravitation. Thereby even force is always supplied to the oscillation regulating system of the double-axis tourbillon. The device incorporates a modified system after a design by Henri Jeanneret.&lt;ref name="Jeanneret"&gt;{{Citation |first=Henri |last=Jeanneret |language=de |contribution=Hemmungsträger für industrielle Apparate mit gleich bleibendem Antrieb |trans-chapter=Inhibition support for industrial equipment with a constant drive |publisher=Verlag ART. Institut Orell Füssli |place=La Chaux-de-Fonds, CH; Zürich, ZH, CH |title=Sonderabdruck aus der schweizerischen technischen Zeitschrift Jahrgang |trans-title=|volume=144 |issue = 11}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Double and quadruple tourbillons===

[[Image:Greubel Forsey Double Tourbillon Technique.jpg|thumb|[[Greubel Forsey]] Double Tourbillon Technique, an example of which won the 2011 International Chronometry Competition held by the Horological Museum in [[Le Locle]]]]
Robert Greubel and Stephen Forsey launched the brand [[Greubel Forsey]] in 2004 with the introduction of their Double Tourbillon 30° (DT30). Both men had been working together since 1992 at Renaud &amp; Papi, where they developed complicated watch movements. The Double Tourbillon 30° features one tourbillon carriage rotating once per minute and inclined at 30°, inside another carriage which rotates once every four minutes. In 2005, Greubel Forsey presented their Quadruple Tourbillon à Différentiel (QDT), using two double-tourbillons working independently. A spherical differential connects the four rotating carriages, distributing torque between two wheels rotating at different speeds.

===Triple-axis tourbillon===

[[Image:Triple Axis Tourbillon Regulator Sport.jpg|thumb|Triple-Axis-Tourbillon Regulator Sport]]
In 2004, [[Thomas Prescher]] developed the first triple-axis tourbillon for the Thomas Prescher Haute Horlogerie&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | publisher = Prescher | place = CH | title = Triple Axis Tourbillon | url = http://www.prescher.ch/Collection/Tourbillion/TripleAxisTourbillon/tabid/77/language/en-US/language/de-DE/Default.aspx}}.&lt;/ref&gt; with constant force in the carriage in a wristwatch. Presented at the [[Baselworld]] 2004 in Basel, Switzerland, in a set of three watches including a single-axis, a double-axis and a triple-axis tourbillon.

The world's unique tri-axial tourbillon movement for wristwatch with traditional jewel bearings only was invented by the independent watchmaker Aaron Becsei, from Bexei Watches, in 2007.  The Primus wristwatch was presented at the [[Baselworld]] 2008 in Basel, Switzerland.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = About Aaron Becsei | url = http://www.bexei.hu/about.html | publisher = Bexei Watches | place = HU}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  In the three axis tourbillon movement, the 3rd (external) cage has a unique form which provides the possibility of using jewel bearings everywhere, instead of ball-bearings. This is a unique solution at this size and level of complication.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.bexei.hu/primus_2_en.html | title = Primus | publisher = Bexei Watches | place = HU}}.&lt;/ref&gt; There are a few wrist and pocket watches that include the Triple Axis or Tri-Axial Tourbillon escapements. Examples of companies and watchmakers that include this mechanism are Vianney Halter in his "Deep Space" watch, Thomas Prescher, Aaron Becsei, Girard-Perregaux with the "Tri-Axial Tourbillon" and Jaeger Le-Coultre with the "Gyrotourbillon".

===Flying tourbillon===
Rather than being supported by a bridge, or cock, at both the top and bottom, the '''flying tourbillon''' is cantilevered, being only supported from one side. The first flying tourbillon was designed by Alfred Helwig, instructor at the German School of Watchmaking, in 1920.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | contribution-url = http://www.glashuette-original.com/meisterschaft/unvergaenglich/alfred_helwig/uhrmacher_helwig/ | publisher = Glasshütte original | title = Alfred Helwig | contribution = Uhrmacher Helwig | language = de}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1993, Kiu Tai-Yu, a [[Chinese people|Chinese]] watchmaker residing in [[Hong Kong]], created a semi-flying tourbillon with only an abbreviated carriage for the [[escapement]] wheel and [[pallet fork]], the upper pivot of the [[balance wheel]] being supported in a sapphire bridge.{{Citation needed |date=July 2015}}

===Gyro tourbillon===
Jaeger-LeCoultre's first wristwatch tourbillon was introduced in 1993 (though JLC had produced tourbillons prior to that, including the famous observatory competition caliber 170) and in 2004 the company introduced the Gyrotourbillon I. Gyrotourbillon I is a double-axis tourbillon with a perpetual calendar and equation of time, and since then, Jaeger-LeCoultre has gone on to produce several variations on the multi-axis tourbillon theme. In general, however, these have been fairly thick watches (Gyrotourbillon I is 16mm thick) but with the Reverso Tribute Gyrotourbillon, JLC has produced a thinner and much more wearable version of its multi-axis tourbillon. At 51.1mm x 31mm x 12.4mm it's still not a small watch, but it is very comfortable on the wrist and certainly easier to wear than some of its predecessors.

==Modern tourbillon watches==
In modern [[mechanical watch]] designs, a tourbillon is not required to produce a highly accurate timepiece; there is even debate amongst [[horology|horologists]] as to whether tourbillons ever improved the accuracy of mechanical time pieces, even when they were first introduced, or whether the time pieces of the day were inherently inaccurate due to design and manufacturing techniques.  Nevertheless, the tourbillon is one of the most valued features of collectors' watches and premium timepieces,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | date = August 2006 | title = WatchTime | format = article | contribution = [[Girard-Perregaux]]'s Tourbillon Icon}}.&lt;/ref&gt; possibly for the same reason that mechanical watches fetch a much higher price than similar [[quartz]] [[Quartz watch|watches]] that are much more accurate.&lt;ref&gt;http://chronocentric.com/watches/accuracy.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;  High-quality tourbillon wristwatches, usually made by the [[Swiss watch|Swiss luxury watch]] industry, are very expensive, and typically retail for tens of thousands of [[dollars]] or [[euro]]s, with much higher prices in the hundreds of thousands of dollars or euros being common.  A recent renaissance of interest in tourbillons has been met by the industry with increased availability of time pieces bearing the feature, with the result that prices for basic tourbillon models have receded somewhat in recent years (whereas previously they were very rare, in either antiques or new merchandise); however, any time piece that has a tourbillon will cost a great deal more than an equivalent piece without the feature.

Modern implementations typically allow the tourbillon to be seen through a window in the watch face.  In addition to enhancing the charm of the piece, the tourbillon can act as a second hand for some watches as it generally rotates once per minute. However some tourbillons spin faster ([[Greubel Forsey|Greubel Forsey's]] 24-second tourbillon for example).  There are many watches that feature the oscillating balance wheel visible through the watch dial that are not tourbillons. This feature is often referred to as "open heart" though it is often called a tourbillon by unscrupulous dealers.

==Affordability crisis==
Several Chinese manufacturers now produce a variety of tourbillon movements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Current Chinese Developments | work = Tourbillon | publisher = Traction ink |url=http://www.tractionink.com/watch_wiki/index.php?title=Tourbillon#Current_Chinese_Developments | accessdate =1 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; These movements are bought as [[ébauches]] by some foreign manufacturers and incorporated into watches that meet the requirements of the Federation of the Swiss Watch Industry to be sold as Swiss Made, requiring 60% of the value to have been made in Switzerland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Swiss Made |publisher=Federation of the Swiss Watch Industry |url=http://www.fhs.ch/en/swissm.php |accessdate=December 21, 2017 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100523071344/http://www.fhs.ch/en/swissm.php |archivedate=May 23, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The availability of cheap tourbillons has led industry spectators to worry that another [[quartz crisis]] may occur, where the Swiss watch industry will not be able to adapt quickly to cheaper complicated mechanical watches produced in other countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=New 'Quartz' Crisis Ahead? |author=Velociphile |work=Rolex |publisher=Watch pro site |date=August 7, 2005 |url=http://rolex.watchprosite.com/?show=forumpost&amp;msid=317682&amp;ti=287901&amp;fi=128&amp;pi=1878396 |accessdate=1 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, TAG Heuer began offering the Carrera Heuer-02T tourbillon at a suggested retail price of 14,900 CHF (~15,000 USD), significantly lower than the 100,000 CHF or more charged by other established Swiss watch brands. &lt;ref name="Bloom"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gretler|first1=Corinne|title=TAG Heuer to Undercut Rivals With Cheapest Swiss Tourbillon|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-01-28/tag-heuer-to-undercut-rivals-with-cheapest-swiss-tourbillon|website=Bloomberg Pursuits|accessdate=21 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4430">'''Wilhelm Heinrich Waagen''' (23 June 1841 &amp;ndash; 24 March 1900) was a [[Geology|geologist]] and [[paleontology|paleontologist]]. He was born in [[Munich]] and died in [[Vienna]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Waagen, Wilhelm Heinrich}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
He received a [[Doctor of Philosophy]] degree at the [[University of Munich]], where he published an elaborate work on geology that was crowned by the university. In 1866 he became an instructor in palaeontology at the University of Munich and at the same time taught [[Princess Theresa of Bavaria|Princess Theresa]] and [[Prince Arnulf of Bavaria]]. Although an excellent teacher, and especially competent in practical work, Waagen, who was a most loyal [[Catholicism|Catholic]], had little prospect of obtaining a professorship at the University of Munich. Consequently, in 1870, he accepted the offer of a position as assistant in the geological survey of [[India]].
[[File:GeologicalSurveyIndia1870.jpg|right|thumb|Geological Survey of India in 1870; Waagen is the second standing figure from the right.]]
In 1875, he returned permanently to Europe because of the severity of the Indian climate. In 1877 he became an instructor at the [[University of Vienna]] in 1877 and lectured with great success on the geology of India. In 1879 Waagen went to the [[Czech Technical University in Prague|German Polytechnic of Prague]] as professor of geology and [[mineralogy]]; in 1890 he was professor of [[palaeontology]] at the [[University of Vienna]]; in 1886 he had declined a call to the school of mines at Berlin.

He was named councillor of the board of mines (Oberbergart) and in 1893 was made a corresponding member of the [[Academy of Sciences]].

Waagen's writings before his trip to India treat especially the German Jura and its fossils. He did work of permanent value in the geological investigation of India (the [[Salt Range]]) by the scientific presentation of rich palaeontological material. Wilhelm Waagen did a pioneer work in the Salt Range. He established a refined [[lithostratigraphy]] of the [[Early Triassic]] series (Mianwali Formation) that still holds today. This allows to replace most of the [[ammonoid]]s he described in their original stratigraphic position, an accomplishment rarely achieved by paleontologists in the late 19th Century. He first realized how important the Early Triassic ammonoid succession of the Salt Range was for the construction of the Triassic time scale.

In 1869, after an exhaustive study of [[ammonites]], Waagen advocated the theory of [[evolution]] or mutation for certain series of fossils. As a young man he had taken an active part in the Catholic life of Munich, and two years before his death he wrote a treatise on the first chapter of [[Genesis (Hebrew Bible)|Genesis]] that showed both the geologist and the Christian.

==Editorial works==
Waagen was one of the editors of the periodical "''Geognostische-paläontologische Beiträge''" (Munich), and during the years 1894-1900 editor of the "''Beiträge zur Paläontologie Oesterreich-Ungarns und des Orients''" (Vienna); after the death of [[Joachim Barrande]] (1883) he edited several volumes of Barrande's work "''Système silurien''". 
Waagen's most important works were: 
* "''Der Jura in Franken, Schwaben und der Schweiz''" (Munich, 1864).
* "''Klassification der Schichten des obern Jura''" (Munich, 1865).
* "''Über die Zone des Ammonites Sowerbyi''" (Munich, 1867)
* "''Die Formenreihe des Ammonites subradiatus''" (Munich, 1869).
* "''Ueber die geologische Verteilung der Organismen in Indien''" (Vienna, 1878).
* "''Das Schopfungsproblem" in "Natur und Offenbarung''" ([[Munster]], 1898; as a separate publication, 1899).
* "''Gliederun der pelagischen Sedimente des Triassystems''" (Vienna, 1895).
He wrote in English: "Jurassic Fauna of Kutch" (1873-6); "Productus Limestone" (1879–91); "Fossils from the Ceratite Formation" (1892).
