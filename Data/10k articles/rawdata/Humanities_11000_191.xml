'''Angkor Wat''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|æ|ŋ|k|ɔːr|_|ˈ|w|ɒ|t}}; {{lang-km|អង្គរវត្ត}}, "Capital Temple") is a temple complex in [[Cambodia]] and one of the largest
religious monuments in the world, on a site measuring {{convert|162.6|ha|m2 acre}}.&lt;ref name="Guinness"&gt;{{cite web|title=Largest religious structure|work=Guinness World Records|url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/largest-religious-structure/|accessdate=29 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was originally constructed as a [[Hinduism|Hindu]] temple dedicated to the god [[Vishnu]] for the [[Khmer Empire]], gradually transforming into a [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] temple towards the end of the 12th century.&lt;ref name="cyark"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cyark.org/news/recycling-monuments-the-hinduismbuddhism-switch-at-angkor|title=Recycling Monuments: The Hinduism/Buddhism Switch at Angkor|author=Ashley M.

Breaking from the [[Shaivism|Shaiva]] tradition of previous kings, Angkor Wat was instead dedicated to Vishnu. As the best-preserved temple at the site, it is the only one to have remained a significant religious centre since its foundation. The temple is at the top of the high classical style of [[Khmer architecture]]. It has become a symbol of [[Cambodia]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Government : Cambodia|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/cb.html|work=CIA World Factbook}}&lt;/ref&gt; appearing on [[Flag of Cambodia|its national flag]], and it is the country's prime attraction for visitors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cambodia's Angkor Wat Breaking Records for Visitors Again {{!}} News from Tourism Cambodia|url=http://www.tourismcambodia.com/news/localnews/8637/cambodias-angkor-wat-breaking-records-for-visitors-again.htm|website=Tourism of Cambodia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Angkor Wat combines two basic plans of Khmer temple architecture: the [[Khmer architecture#Temple mountain|temple-mountain]] and the later [[Khmer architecture#Gallery|galleried temple]]. It is designed to represent [[Mount Meru]], home of the [[Deva (Hinduism)|devas]] in [[Hindu mythology]]: within a [[moat]] more than 5 kilometres (3&amp;nbsp;mi) long&lt;ref name=Jarus2018&gt;{{cite news |last1=Jarus |first1=Owen |title=Angkor Wat: History of Ancient Temple |url=https://www.livescience.com/23841-angkor-wat.html |accessdate=28 July 2018 |work=Live Science |publisher=Purch |date=5 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and an outer wall {{convert|3.6|km|mi|1}} long are three rectangular galleries, each raised above the next. At the centre of the temple stands a [[quincunx]] of towers. Unlike most Angkorian temples, Angkor Wat is oriented to the west; scholars are divided as to the significance of this. The temple is admired for the grandeur and harmony of the architecture, its extensive [[Relief#Bas-relief or low relief|bas-reliefs]], and for the numerous [[devata]]s adorning its walls.

==Etymology==
The modern name, Angkor Wat ({{lang-km|អង្គរវត្ត}}) (alternate name: ''Nokor Wat'', {{lang-km|នគរវត្ត}}),&lt;ref&gt;Khmer dictionary adopted from Khmer dictionary of Buddhist institute of Cambodia, p. 1424, pub. 2007&lt;/ref&gt; means "Temple City" or "City of Temples" in [[Khmer language|Khmer]]; ''Angkor'' ({{lang-km|អង្គរ}}) meaning "city" or "capital city", is a vernacular form of the word ''nokor'' ({{lang-km|នគរ}}), which comes from the [[Sanskrit]] word ''nagara'' ([[Devanāgarī]]: नगर).&lt;ref name=Nath&gt;Chuon Nath Khmer Dictionary (1966, Buddhist Institute, Phnom Penh)&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Wat]]'' ({{lang-km|វត្ត}}) is the [[Khmer language|Khmer]] word for "temple grounds", also derived from [[Sanskrit]] ''vāṭa'' ([[Devanāgarī]]: वाट), meaning "enclosure".&lt;ref name=Headley77&gt;Cambodian-English Dictionary by Robert K. Headley, Kylin Chhor, Lam Kheng Lim, Lim Hak Kheang, and Chen Chun (1977, Catholic University Press)&lt;/ref&gt;

The original name of the temple was Vrah Viṣṇuloka or Parama Viṣṇuloka ([[Sanskrit]]), ({{lang-km|បរមវិស្ណុលោក}} – ''Barom Visnulōk'') which means the sacred dwelling of Vishnu.

==History==

[[File:Suryavarman II in procession.jpg|thumb|left|King [[Suryavarman II]], the builder of Angkor Wat]]
Angkor Wat lies {{convert|5.5|km|mi}} north of the modern town of [[Siem Reap]], and a short distance south and slightly east of the previous capital, which was centred at [[Baphuon]]. In an area of Cambodia where there is an important group of ancient structures, it is the southernmost of Angkor's main sites.

According to legend, the construction of Angkor Wat was ordered by Indra to serve as a palace for his son Precha Ket Mealea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=HAZrFhvqnTkC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage|title=Asiatic Mythology:A Detailed Description and Explanation of the Mythologies of All the Great Nations of Asia|author1= J. Hackin|author2= Clayment Huart|author3= Raymonde Linossier| author4=Raymonde Linossier|author5= H. de Wilman Grabowska|author6= Charles-Henri Marchal|author7= Henri Maspero|author8= Serge Eliseev|date=1932|page=194|isbn=978-8120609204}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the 13th-century Chinese traveller [[Zhou Daguan]], some believed that the temple was constructed in a single night by a divine architect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title= A Record of Cambodia: The Land and Its People|author=daguan Zhou|others=Translated by Peter Harris|publisher=Silkworm Books|date=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The initial design and construction of the temple took place in the first half of the 12th century, during the reign of [[Suryavarman II]] (ruled 1113 – c. 1150). Dedicated to [[Vishnu]], it was built as the king's state temple and capital city. As neither the foundation [[Stele|stela]] nor any contemporary inscriptions referring to the temple have been found, its original name is unknown, but it may have been known as "Varah Vishnu-lok" after the presiding deity. Work seems to have ended shortly after the king's death, leaving some of the [[Relief#Bas-relief or low relief|bas-relief]] decoration unfinished.&lt;ref name="Ohio"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://huntingtonarchive.osu.edu/seasia/angkor.html|title=Angkor Wat, 1113–1150 |accessdate=27 April 2008 |publisher=College of the Arts, The Ohio State University |work=The Huntington Archive of Buddhist and Related Art}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1177, approximately 27 years after the death of Suryavarman II, Angkor was sacked by the [[Champa|Chams]], the traditional enemies of the Khmer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Coedès|first= George|authorlink= George Coedès|editor= Walter F.

Towards the end of the 12th century, Angkor Wat gradually transformed from a Hindu centre of worship to [[Buddhism]], which continues to the present day.&lt;ref name="cyark" /&gt; Angkor Wat is unusual among the Angkor temples in that although it was largely neglected after the 16th century it was never completely abandoned.&lt;ref&gt;Glaize, ''The Monuments of the Angkor Group'' p. 59.&lt;/ref&gt; Fourteen inscriptions dated from the 17th century discovered in Angkor area testify to [[Japanese people|Japanese]] Buddhist pilgrims that had established small settlements alongside Khmer locals.&lt;ref name="Nikkei"&gt;{{cite web |title =Japanese Diaspora – Cambodia | author = Masako Fukawa | author2 = Stan Fukawa |date = 6 Nov 2014 | website = Discover Nikkei | url =http://www.discovernikkei.org/en/journal/2014/11/6/japanese-diaspora-cambodia/ | accessdate =18 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; At that time, the temple was thought by the Japanese visitors as the famed [[Jetavana]] garden of the [[Buddha]], which originally located in the kingdom of [[Magadha]], India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Au-dela du plan Japonais du XVII siècle d'Angkor Vat,  (A XVII century Japanese map of Angkor Wat) |author = Abdoul-Carime Nasir |url =http://aefek.free.fr/iso_album/carteangkor_jetavana.pdf | language =French |accessdate =18 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The best-known inscription tells of [[Ukondafu Kazufusa]], who celebrated the [[Khmer New Year]] at Angkor Wat in 1632.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = History of Cambodia, Post-Angkor Era (1431 – present day) | work = Cambodia Travel |url =http://www.cambodia-travel.com/khmer/post-angkor.htm |accessdate =18 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the first Western visitors to the temple was [[António da Madalena]], a [[Portugal|Portuguese]] friar who visited in 1586 and said that it "is of such extraordinary construction that it is not possible to describe it with a pen, particularly since it is like no other building in the world. It has towers and decoration and all the refinements which the human genius can conceive of."&lt;ref&gt;Higham, ''The Civilization of Angkor'' pp. 1–2.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the mid-19th century, the temple was effectively rediscovered by the French naturalist and explorer [[Henri Mouhot]], who popularised the site in the West through the publication of travel notes, in which he wrote:{{cquote|One of these temples, a rival to that of [[Solomon's Temple|Solomon]], and erected by some ancient [[Michelangelo]],
might take an honorable place beside our most beautiful buildings.
It is grander than anything
left to us by [[Ancient Greece|Greece]]
or [[Ancient Rome|Rome]], and presents a sad contrast to the state of barbarism in which the nation is now plunged.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in [http://www.cambodianview.com/documents/articles/Brief_Presentation.pdf Brief Presentation by Venerable Vodano Sophan Seng]&lt;/ref&gt;}}Angkor Wat may relate to the architecture of the Greek and Roman record explored in terms of the west rather than east orientation of the temple. Some architects have written that it is 'correct' for the construction to be facing to the west. In temple orientations for the Greek and Etruscan context, west is associated with "right" and the "underworld" to suggest a religious connection of the building.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Aveni|first=A.|last2=Romano|first2=G.|date=September 1994|title=Orientation and Etruscan ritual|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/antiquity/article/orientation-and-etruscan-ritual/E68E1A7992190129C4168A3629E39C9A|journal=Antiquity|language=en|volume=68|issue=260|pages=545–563|doi=10.1017/S0003598X00047049|issn=0003-598X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mouhot, like other early Western visitors, found it difficult to believe that the Khmers could have built the temple and mistakenly dated it to around the same era as Rome. His reports inspired the French government, already an established presence in Indochina, to begin a systematic study of the ruins. The true history of Angkor Wat was pieced together from stylistic and [[epigraphy|epigraphic]] evidence accumulated during subsequent clearing and restoration work.  There were no ordinary dwellings or houses or other signs of settlement, including cooking utensils, weapons, or items of clothing usually found at ancient sites. Instead there is only the evidence of the monuments themselves.&lt;ref name="Southeast Asia 1995 p. 67-99"&gt;''Time Life Lost Civilizations series: Southeast Asia: A Past Regained'' (1995). pp. 67–99&lt;/ref&gt; An exploration commission began drawing up a list of principal monuments. Subsequent missions copied inscriptions written on Angkor buildings so scholars might translate them and learn something of Angkor's history. By 1885 they had worked up a chronology of the rulers and developed the outlines of a description of the civilization that had produced the temple complex.  In 1898 the French decided to commit substantial funds to Angkor's preservation. Centuries of neglect had permitted the jungle to recapture many of the more significant structures, and unless efforts were made to free the buildings from the embrace of huge banyan and silk-cotton trees, they might soon be crushed to destruction.

The 20th century saw considerable restoration of Angkor Wat.&lt;ref name="multiref1"&gt;Glaize p. 59.&lt;/ref&gt; Gradually teams of laborers and archeologists pushed back the jungle and exposed the expanses of stone, permitting the sun once again to illuminate the dark corners of the temple. Work was interrupted by the [[Cambodian Civil War]] and [[Khmer Rouge]] control of the country during the 1970s and 1980s, but relatively little damage was done during this period. Camping Khmer Rouge forces used whatever wood remained in the building structures for firewood, and a shoot-out between Khmer Rouge and Vietnamese forces put a few bullet holes in a bas relief. Far more damage was done after the wars, by [[art thieves]] working out of Thailand, which, in the late 1980s and early 1990s, claimed almost every head that could be lopped off the structures, including reconstructions.&lt;ref name="Angkor Battle"&gt;{{cite magazine|url=https://books.google.dk/books?id=9hAteN7ddW0C&amp;pg=PA52&amp;lpg=PA52&amp;dq=Angkor+Wat+Khmer+Rouge+war#v=onepage&amp;q=Angkor%20Wat%20Khmer%20Rouge%20war|title=The Battle of Angkor Wat |magazine=New Scientist|pages=52–57|date=14 October 1989 |author=Russell Ciochon |author2=Jamie James |last-author-amp=yes |accessdate=22 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The temple is a powerful symbol of Cambodia, and is a source of great national pride that has factored into Cambodia's diplomatic relations with France, the United States and its neighbour Thailand. A depiction of Angkor Wat has been a part of [[Flag of Cambodia|Cambodian national flags]] since the introduction of the first version circa 1863.&lt;ref&gt;Flags of the World, [http://flagspot.net/flags/kh_hstry.html Cambodian Flag History]&lt;/ref&gt; From a larger historical and even transcultural perspective, however, the temple of Angkor Wat did not become a symbol of national pride ''sui generis'' but had been inscribed into a larger politico-cultural process of French-colonial heritage production in which the original temple site was presented in French colonial and universal exhibitions in Paris and Marseille between 1889 and 1937.&lt;ref&gt;Falser, Michael (2011).  [http://archiv.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/ojs/index.php/transcultural/article/view/9083 ''Krishna and the Plaster Cast. Translating the Cambodian Temple of Angkor Wat in the French Colonial Period''].&lt;/ref&gt; Angkor Wat's aesthetics were also on display in the plaster cast museum of [[Louis Delaporte]] called ''musée Indo-chinois'' which existed in the Parisian Trocadero Palace from c.1880 to the mid-1920s.&lt;ref&gt;Falser, Michael (2013).  [http://www.riha-journal.org/articles/2013/2013-apr-jun/falser-musee-indo-chinois ''From Gaillon to Sanchi, from Vézelay to Angkor Wat. The Musée Indo-Chinois in Paris: A Transcultural Perspective on Architectural Museums.''].&lt;/ref&gt;

The splendid artistic legacy of Angkor Wat and other Khmer monuments in the [[Angkor]] region led directly to France adopting Cambodia as a [[protectorate]] on 11 August 1863 and invading Siam to take control of the ruins. This quickly led to Cambodia reclaiming lands in the northwestern corner of the country that had been under Siamese (Thai) control since AD 1351 (Manich Jumsai 2001), or by some accounts, AD 1431.&lt;ref&gt;Penny Edwards (2007).''Cambodge: The Cultivation of a Nation, 1860–1945'' {{ISBN|978-0824829230}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cambodia gained independence from France on 9 November 1953 and has controlled Angkor Wat since that time. It is safe to say that from the colonial period onwards until the site's nomination as [[UNESCO World Heritage]] in 1992, this specific temple of Angkor Wat was instrumental in the formation of the modern and gradually globalised concept of built cultural heritage.&lt;ref&gt;Falser, Michael: Clearing the Path towards Civilization – 150 Years of "Saving Angkor". In: Michael Falser (ed.) Cultural Heritage as Civilizing Mission. From Decay to Recovery. Springer: Heidelberg, New York, pp.&amp;nbsp;279–346.&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2015, it was announced that a research team from [[University of Sydney]] had found a previously unseen ensemble of buried towers built and demolished during the construction of Angkor Wat, as well as massive structure of unknown purpose on its south side and wooden fortifications. The findings also include evidence of low-density residential occupation in the region, with a road grid, ponds and mounds. These indicate that the temple precinct, bounded by moat and wall, may not have been used exclusively by the priestly elite, as was previously thought. The team used [[LiDAR]], [[ground-penetrating radar]] and targeted excavation to map Angkor Wat.&lt;ref name="sydney"&gt;{{cite web | url =http://sydney.edu.au/news-opinion/news/2015/12/09/new-discoveries-redefine-angkor-wat-s-history.html|title=Recent research has transformed archaeologists' understanding of Angkor Wat and its surroundings|publisher=University of Sydney| date=9 December 2015| accessdate =10 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Site and plan===
[[File:Angkor-Wat-from-the-air.JPG|thumb|left|Aerial view of Angkor Wat]]
Angkor Wat, located at {{Coord|13|24|45|N|103|52|0|E|type:landmark_region:KH|display=inline}}, is a unique combination of the [[Khmer architecture#Temple mountain|temple mountain]] (the standard design for the empire's state temples) and the later plan of concentric [[Khmer architecture#Gallery|galleries]]. The construction of Angkor Wat also suggests that there was a celestial significance with certain features of the temple. This is observed in the temple's east-west orientation, and lines of sight from terraces within the temple that show specific towers to be at the precise location of the sunrise on a solstice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Fleming |first1=Stuart |title=Science Scope: The City of Angkor Wat: A Royal Observatory on Life? |journal=Archaeology |date=1985 |volume=38 |issue=1 |pages=62–72 |jstor=41731666}}&lt;/ref&gt; The temple is a representation of [[Mount Meru]], the home of the gods: the central [[quincunx]] of towers symbolises the five peaks of the mountain, and the walls and moat symbolise the surrounding mountain ranges and ocean.&lt;ref name="multiref2"&gt;Freeman and Jacques p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt; Access to the upper areas of the temple was progressively more exclusive, with the laity being admitted only to the lowest level.&lt;ref&gt;Glaize p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike most Khmer temples, Angkor Wat is oriented to the west rather than the east. This has led many (including [[Maurice Glaize]] and [[George Coedès]]) to conclude that Suryavarman intended it to serve as his funerary temple.&lt;ref name=Coedes&gt;{{cite book|last= Coedès|first= George|authorlink= George Coedès|editor= Walter F. Vella|others= trans.Susan Brown Cowing|title= The Indianized States of Southeast Asia|date= 1968|publisher= University of Hawaii Press|isbn= 978-0824803681 |page=162 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The diplomatic envoy Zhou Da Guan sent by Emperor [[Temür Khan]] to Angkor in 1295 reported that the head of state was buried in a tower after his death, and he referred to Angkor Wat as a mausoleum&lt;/ref&gt; Further evidence for this view is provided by the [[Relief#Bas-relief or low relief|bas-reliefs]], which proceed in a counter-clockwise direction—''[[Mandir|prasavya]]'' in Hindu terminology—as this is the reverse of the normal order. Rituals take place in reverse order during Brahminic funeral services.&lt;ref name="multiref1" /&gt; The archaeologist [[Charles Higham (archaeologist)|Charles Higham]] also describes a container which may have been a funerary jar which was recovered from the central tower.&lt;ref name="multiref3"&gt;Higham, ''The Civilization of Angkor'' p. 118.&lt;/ref&gt; It has been nominated by some as the greatest expenditure of energy on the disposal of a corpse.&lt;ref name="Scarre p. 81-85"&gt;Scarre, Chris editor (1999). "The Seventy Wonders of the Ancient World", London: Thames &amp; Hudson, pp.&amp;nbsp;81–85&lt;/ref&gt;  Freeman and Jacques, however, note that several other temples of [[Angkor]] depart from the typical eastern orientation, and suggest that Angkor Wat's alignment was due to its dedication to [[Vishnu]], who was associated with the west.&lt;ref name="multiref2" /&gt;

A further interpretation of Angkor Wat has been proposed by Eleanor Mannikka. Drawing on the temple's alignment and dimensions, and on the content and arrangement of the bas-reliefs, she argues that the structure represents a claimed new era of peace under King [[Suryavarman II]]: "as the measurements of solar and lunar time cycles were built into the sacred space of Angkor Wat, this divine mandate to rule was anchored to consecrated chambers and corridors meant to perpetuate the king's power and to honour and placate the deities manifest in the heavens above."&lt;ref&gt;[[Eleanor Mannikka|Mannikka, Eleanor]].

===Style===
[[File:Angkor Vat (6931599619).jpg|thumb|left|Angkor Wat as viewed from the side]]
Angkor Wat is the prime example of the classical style of [[Khmer architecture]]—the Angkor Wat style—to which it has given its name. By the 12th century Khmer architects had become skilled and confident in the use of [[sandstone]] (rather than brick or [[laterite]]) as the main building material. Most of the visible areas are of sandstone blocks, while laterite was used for the outer wall and for hidden structural parts. The binding agent used to join the blocks is yet to be identified, although natural [[resin]]s or [[slaked lime]] has been suggested.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gacp-angkor.de/ German Apsara Conservation Project] Building Techniques, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

The temple has drawn praise above all for the harmony of its design. According to Maurice Glaize, a mid-20th-century conservator of Angkor, the temple "attains a classic perfection by the restrained monumentality of its finely balanced elements and the precise arrangement of its proportions. It is a work of power, unity and style."&lt;ref&gt;Glaize p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt;

Architecturally, the elements characteristic of the style include: the [[Ogive|ogival]], redented towers shaped like [[Nelumbo nucifera|lotus]] buds; half-[[Architecture of Cambodia#Gallery|galleries]] to broaden passageways; axial galleries connecting enclosures; and the cruciform terraces which appear along the main axis of the temple. Typical decorative elements are [[Architecture of Cambodia#Apsara and devata|devatas (or apsaras)]], [[bas-relief]]s, and on [[pediment]]s extensive garlands and narrative scenes. The statuary of Angkor Wat is considered conservative, being more static and less graceful than earlier work.&lt;ref&gt;APSARA authority, [http://www.autoriteapsara.org/en/angkor/art/styles/angkorian/angkor_vat.html Angkor Vat Style]&lt;/ref&gt; Other elements of the design have been destroyed by looting and the passage of time, including [[gilding|gilded]] [[stucco]] on the towers, gilding on some figures on the bas-reliefs, and wooden ceiling panels and doors.&lt;ref&gt;Freeman and Jacques p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Features===

====Outer enclosure====
[[File:West wall of the outer enclosure Angkor Wat0636.jpg|thumb|left|View of the west wall of the outer enclosure of Angkor Wat]]
[[File:Angkor Wat 005.jpg|thumb|right|Northern library]]
The outer wall, {{convert|1024|m|ft|abbr=on}} by {{convert|802|m|ft|abbr=on}} and {{convert|4.5|m|ft|abbr=on}} high, is surrounded by a {{convert|30|m|ft|abbr=on}} apron of open ground and a moat {{convert|190|m|ft|abbr=on}} wide and over 5 kilometres (3&amp;nbsp;mi) in perimeter.&lt;ref name=Jarus2018 /&gt; Access to the temple is by an earth bank to the east and a sandstone causeway to the west; the latter, the main entrance, is a later addition, possibly replacing a wooden bridge.&lt;ref name="multiref4"&gt;Freeman and Jacques p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt; There are [[Architecture of Cambodia#Gopura|gopuras]] at each of the [[cardinal point]]s; the western is by far the largest and has three ruined towers. Glaize notes that this gopura both hides and echoes the form of the temple proper.&lt;ref&gt;Glaize p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt; Under the southern tower is a statue of [[Vishnu]], known as ''Ta Reach'', which may originally have occupied the temple's central shrine.&lt;ref name="multiref4" /&gt; Galleries run between the towers and as far as two further entrances on either side of the gopura often referred to as "elephant gates", as they are large enough to admit those animals. These galleries have square pillars on the outer (west) side and a closed wall on the inner (east) side. The ceiling between the pillars is decorated with [[Nelumbo nucifera|lotus]] rosettes; the west face of the wall with dancing figures; and the east face of the wall with balustered windows, dancing male figures on prancing animals, and [[Architecture of Cambodia#Apsara and devata|devatas]], including (south of the entrance) the only one in the temple to be showing her teeth.

The outer wall encloses a space of 820,000 square metres (203 acres), which besides the temple proper was originally occupied by the city and, to the north of the temple, the royal palace. Like all secular buildings of Angkor, these were built of perishable materials rather than of stone, so nothing remains of them except the outlines of some of the streets.&lt;ref name="Freeman and Jacques p. 50"&gt;Freeman and Jacques p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the area is now covered by forest. A {{convert|350|m|ft|abbr=on}} causeway connects the western gopura to the temple proper, with [[Architecture of Cambodia#Naga|naga]] balustrades and six sets of steps leading down to the city on either side. Each side also features a [[Architecture of Cambodia#Library|library]] with entrances at each cardinal point, in front of the third set of stairs from the entrance, and a pond between the library and the temple itself. The ponds are later additions to the design, as is the cruciform terrace guarded by lions connecting the causeway to the central structure.&lt;ref name="Freeman and Jacques p. 50"/&gt;

====Central structure====
[[File:Middle tower of Angkor Wat temple.jpg|thumb|right|upright|The middle tower of Angkor Wat symbolizes the sacred mountain, mount Meru.]]
[[File:Angot war.jpg|thumb|left|Aerial view of the central structure; in front of the central structure lies the cruciform terrace.]]
The temple stands on a terrace raised higher than the city. It is made of three rectangular [[Architecture of Cambodia#Gallery|galleries]] rising to a central tower, each level higher than the last. Mannikka interprets these galleries as being dedicated to the king, [[Brahma]], the moon, and [[Vishnu]].&lt;ref name="Ohio" /&gt; Each gallery has a [[gopura]] at each of the points, and the two inner galleries each have towers at their corners, forming a [[Architecture of Cambodia#Quincunx|quincunx]] with the central tower. Because the temple faces west, the features are all set back towards the east, leaving more space to be filled in each enclosure and gallery on the west side; for the same reason the west-facing steps are shallower than those on the other sides.
[[File:Awatcornertower01.JPG|thumb|left|upright|A tower of Angkor Wat]]
[[File:REJ 2790.jpg|thumb|View of the Outer Gallery of Angkor Wat]]

The outer gallery measures {{convert|187|m|ft|abbr=on}} by {{convert|215|m|ft|abbr=on}}, with pavilions rather than towers at the corners. The gallery is open to the outside of the temple, with columned half-galleries extending and buttressing the structure. Connecting the outer gallery to the second enclosure on the west side is a cruciform cloister called ''Preah Poan'' (the "Hall of a Thousand Gods"). [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] images were left in the cloister by pilgrims over the centuries, although most have now been removed. This area has many inscriptions relating the good deeds of pilgrims, most written in [[Khmer language|Khmer]] but others in [[Burmese language|Burmese]] and Japanese. The four small courtyards marked out by the cloister may originally have been filled with water.&lt;ref&gt;Glaize p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt; North and south of the cloister are [[Architecture of Cambodia#Library|libraries]].

Beyond, the second and inner galleries are connected to each other and to two flanking libraries by another cruciform terrace, again a later addition. From the second level upwards, [[Architecture of Cambodia#Apsara and devata|devatas]] abound on the walls, singly or in groups of up to four. The second-level enclosure is {{convert|100|m|ft|abbr=on}} by {{convert|115|m|ft|abbr=on}}, and may originally have been flooded to represent the [[ocean]] around [[Mount Meru]].&lt;ref&gt;Ray, ''Lonely Planet guide to Cambodia'' p. 195.&lt;/ref&gt; Three sets of steps on each side lead up to the corner towers and gopuras of the inner gallery. The very steep stairways represent the difficulty of ascending to the kingdom of the gods.&lt;ref&gt;Ray p. 199.&lt;/ref&gt; This inner gallery, called the ''Bakan'', is a {{convert|60|m|ft|abbr=on}} square with axial galleries connecting each gopura with the central shrine, and subsidiary shrines located below the corner towers. The roofings of the galleries are decorated with the motif of the body of a snake ending in the heads of lions or [[garuda]]s. Carved [[Architecture of Cambodia#Lintels and pediments|lintels and pediments]] decorate the entrances to the galleries and to the shrines.
The tower above the central shrine rises {{convert|43|m|ft|abbr=on}} to a height of {{convert|65|m|ft|abbr=on}} above the ground; unlike those of previous temple mountains, the central tower is raised above the surrounding four.&lt;ref&gt;Briggs p. 199.&lt;/ref&gt; The shrine itself, originally occupied by a statue of Vishnu and open on each side, was walled in when the temple was converted to [[Theravada Buddhism]], the new walls featuring standing Buddhas. In 1934, the conservator George Trouvé excavated the pit beneath the central shrine: filled with sand and water it had already been robbed of its treasure, but he did find a sacred foundation deposit of [[gold leaf]] two metres above ground level.&lt;ref&gt;Glaize p. 65.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Decoration====
[[File:Awatoceanofmilk01.JPG|thumb|The bas-relief of the [[Samudra manthan|Churning of the Sea of Milk]] shows [[Vishnu]] in the centre, his turtle [[Avatar]] [[Kurma]] below, [[asura]]s and [[deva (Hinduism)|devas]] to left and right, and [[apsaras]] and [[Indra]] above.]]
[[File:Angkor Wat - 047 Apsaras (8581709930).jpg|thumb|left|[[Devatas]] are characteristic of the Angkor Wat style.]]
Integrated with the architecture of the building, and one of the causes for its fame is Angkor Wat's extensive decoration, which predominantly takes the form of [[bas-relief]] friezes. The inner walls of the outer gallery bear a series of large-scale scenes mainly depicting episodes from the Hindu epics the [[Ramayana]] and the [[Mahabharata]]. Higham has called these, "the greatest known linear arrangement of stone carving".&lt;ref&gt;Higham, ''Early Cultures of Mainland Southeast Asia'' p. 318.&lt;/ref&gt; From the north-west corner anti-clockwise, the western gallery shows the Battle of Lanka (from the Ramayana, in which [[Rama]] defeats [[Ravana]]) and the [[Kurukshetra War|Battle of Kurukshetra]] (from the Mahabharata, showing the mutual annihilation of the [[Kaurava]] and [[Pandava]] clans). On the southern gallery follow the only historical scene, a procession of [[Suryavarman II]], then the 32 [[hell]]s and 37 [[heaven]]s of Hinduism.&lt;ref&gt;Glaize p. 68.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Angkor-4+.JPG|thumb|upright|Decoration on the corner]]
On the eastern gallery is one of the most celebrated scenes, the [[Kurma|Churning of the Sea of Milk]], showing 92&lt;ref&gt;Glaize&lt;/ref&gt; [[asura]]s and 88 [[deva (Hinduism)|devas]] using the serpent [[Vasuki (snake)|Vasuki]] to churn the sea under Vishnu's direction (Mannikka counts only 91 asuras, and explains the asymmetrical numbers as representing the number of days from the [[winter solstice]] to the [[spring equinox]], and from the equinox to the summer [[solstice]]).&lt;ref&gt;Described in Michael Buckley, [http://www.veloasia.com/library/buckley/churning_milk.html The Churning of the Ocean of Milk]&lt;/ref&gt; It is followed by Vishnu defeating [[asura]]s (a 16th-century addition). The northern gallery shows Krishna's victory over [[Banasura|Bana]] (where according to Glaize, "The workmanship is at its worst").&lt;ref&gt;Glaize p. 69.&lt;/ref&gt;

Angkor Wat is decorated with depictions of [[apsaras]] and [[devata]]; there are more than 1,796 depictions of devata in the present research inventory.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.devata.org/2010/02/angkor-wat-devata-inventory/ Angkor Wat devata inventory – February 2010] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100423123631/http://www.devata.org/2010/02/angkor-wat-devata-inventory/ |date=23 April 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Angkor Wat architects employed small apsara images ({{convert|30|cm|in|abbr=on}}–{{convert|40|cm|in|abbr=on}}) as decorative motifs on pillars and walls. They incorporated larger devata images (all full-body portraits measuring approximately {{convert|95|cm|in|abbr=on}}–{{convert|110|cm|in|abbr=on}}) more prominently at every level of the temple from the entry pavilion to the tops of the high towers. In 1927, Sappho Marchal published a study cataloging the remarkable diversity of their hair, headdresses, garments, stance, jewellery and decorative flowers, which Marchal concluded were based on actual practices of the Angkor period.&lt;ref&gt;Sappho Marchal, ''Khmer Costumes and Ornaments of the Devatas of Angkor Wat''.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Construction techniques===
[[File:Angkor Wat 13 11.JPG|thumb|upright|Corridor]]
The stones, as smooth as polished marble, were laid without mortar with very tight joints that are sometimes hard to find. The blocks were held together by [[mortise and tenon]] joints in some cases, while in others they used dovetails and gravity. The blocks were presumably put in place by a combination of elephants, [[coir]] ropes, pulleys and [[bamboo scaffolding]]. Henri Mouhot noted that most of the blocks had holes {{convert|2.5|cm|in|abbr=on}} in diameter and {{convert|3|cm|in|abbr=on}} deep, with more holes on the larger blocks. Some scholars have suggested that these were used to join them together with iron rods, but others claim they were used to hold temporary pegs to help manoeuvre them into place.

The monument was made out of 5 million to 10 million sandstone blocks with a maximum weight of 1.5 tons each.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livescience.com/24440-angkor-wat-canals.html|title=Mystery of Angkor Wat Temple's Huge Stones Solved|date=31 October 2012|last=Ghose|first=Tia|work=livescience.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, the entire city of [[Angkor]] used up far greater amounts of stone than all the Egyptian pyramids combined, and occupied an area significantly greater than modern-day [[Paris]]. Moreover, unlike the Egyptian pyramids which use limestone quarried barely {{convert|0.5|km|mi|abbr=on}} away all the time, the entire city of Angkor was built with sandstone quarried {{convert|40|km|mi|abbr=on}} (or more) away.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://video.nationalgeographic.com/video/specials/ancient-mysteries/angkor-wat-temples/|title=Lost City of Angkor Wat|work=National Geographic}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This sandstone had to be transported from Mount Kulen, a quarry approximately {{convert|25|mi|km}} to the northeast. The route has been suggested to span {{convert|35|km|mi}} along a canal towards [[Tonlé Sap]] lake, another {{convert|35|km|mi}} crossing the lake, and finally {{convert|15|km|mi}} against the current along [[Siem Reap River]], making a total journey of {{convert|90|km|mi}}. However, Etsuo Uchida and Ichita Shimoda of [[Waseda University]] in [[Tokyo]], [[Japan]] have discovered in 2011 a shorter {{convert|35|km|mi|adj=on}} canal connecting Mount Kulen and Angkor Wat using satellite imagery. The two believe that the Khmer used this route instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| first = Etsuo | last = Uchida | first2 = Ichita | last2 = Shimoda | title = Quarries and transportation routes of Angkor monument sandstone blocks | journal = Journal of Archaeological Science | volume = 40 | issue = 2 | date = 2013 | doi = 10.1016/j.jas.2012.09.036 | issn = 0305-4403 | pages = 1158–1164}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Virtually all of its surfaces, columns, lintels and even roofs are carved. There are miles of reliefs illustrating scenes from [[Indian literature]] including unicorns, griffins, winged dragons pulling chariots as well as warriors following an elephant-mounted leader and celestial dancing girls with elaborate hair styles. The gallery wall alone is decorated with almost 1,000 square metres of bas reliefs. Holes on some of the Angkor walls indicate that they may have been decorated with bronze sheets. These were highly prized in ancient times and were a prime target for robbers. While excavating Khajuraho, Alex Evans, a stonemason and sculptor, recreated a stone sculpture under {{convert|4|ft|m}}, this took about 60 days to carve.&lt;ref&gt;"Lost Worlds of the Kama Sutra" History channel&lt;/ref&gt; Roger Hopkins and Mark Lehner also conducted experiments to quarry limestone which took 12 quarrymen 22 days to quarry about 400 tons of stone.&lt;ref&gt;Lehner, Mark  (1997). ''The Complete Pyramids'', London: Thames and Hudson, pp.&amp;nbsp;202–225 {{ISBN|0500050848}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The labour force to quarry, transport, carve and install so much sandstone must have run into the thousands including many highly skilled artisans. The skills required to carve these sculptures were developed hundreds of years earlier, as demonstrated by some artefacts that have been dated to the seventh century, before the Khmer came to power.&lt;ref name="Southeast Asia 1995 p. 67-99"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Scarre p. 81-85"/&gt;

===Restoration and conservation===
[[File:WMF Angkor Wat.ogv|[[World Monuments Fund]] video on conservation of Angkor Wat|thumb]]
As with most other ancient temples in Cambodia, Angkor Wat has faced extensive damage and deterioration by a combination of plant overgrowth, fungi, ground movements, war damage and theft. The war damage to Angkor Wat's temples however has been very limited, compared to the rest of Cambodia's temple ruins, and it has also received the most attentive restoration.&lt;ref name="Angkor Battle"/&gt;

[[File:Bullet holes at angkor wat.jpg|thumb|left|Bullet holes left by a shoot-out between the Khmer Rouge and Vietnamese forces at Angkor Wat.]]

The restoration of Angkor Wat in the modern era began with the establishment of the Conservation d'Angkor (Angkor Conservancy) by the [[École française d'Extrême-Orient]] (EFEO) in 1908; before that date, activities at the site were primarily concerned with exploration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wmf.org/sites/default/files/wmf_publication/Considerations_for_the_Conservation_and_Preservation_of_the_Historic_City_of_Angkor_Report_I.pdf |title=Considerations for the Conservation and Presentation of the.

The main phase of work ended in 2012, with the final component being the installation of finials on the roof of the gallery in 2013.

Microbial biofilms have been found degrading sandstone at Angkor Wat, Preah Khan, and the Bayon and West Prasat in Angkor. The dehydration- and radiation-resistant filamentous cyanobacteria can produce organic acids that degrade the stone. A dark filamentous fungus was found in internal and external [[Preah Khan]] samples, while the alga ''[[Trentepohlia (alga)|Trentepohlia]]'' was found only in samples taken from external, pink-stained stone at Preah Khan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Microbial biofilms on the sandstone monuments of the Angkor Wat Complex, Cambodia|journal=Current Microbiology|date=Feb 2012|pages=85–92|volume=64|author1=Gaylarde CC|author2=Rodríguez CH|author3=Navarro-Noya YE|author4=Ortega-Morales BO|doi=10.1007/s00284-011-0034-y|pmid=22006074|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Replicas were also made to replace some of the lost or damaged sculptures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-19279491 |title=Restoring ancient monuments at Cambodia's Angkor Wat|author= Guy De Launey|date=21 August 2012 |work=BBC }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tourism===

Since the 1990s, Angkor Wat has become a major tourist destination.  In 1993, there were only 7,650 visitors to the site;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/feb/25/travel.travelnews |title= Tourist invasion threatens to ruin glories of Angkor Wat |author=Justine Smith |date= 25 February 2007 |work=The Observer}}&lt;/ref&gt; by 2004, government figures show that 561,000 foreign visitors had arrived in Siem Reap province that year, approximately 50% of all foreign tourists in Cambodia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  |url=http://www.tourismcambodia.com/Statistics/index.asp?Year=2005 |title=Executive Summary from Jan–Dec 2005 |accessdate=25 April 2008 |work=Tourism of Cambodia |publisher=Statistics &amp; Tourism Information Department, Ministry of Tourism of Cambodia| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080413115411/http://www.tourismcambodia.com/Statistics/index.asp?Year=2005| archivedate= 13 April 2008 | deadurl= yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The number reached over a million in 2007,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tourismcambodia.org/images/mot/statistic_reports/tourism_statistics_annual_report_book_2007.pdf |title=Tourism Statistics: Annual Report |page=60 |work=Ministry of Tourism }}&lt;/ref&gt; and over two million by 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tourismcambodia.org/images/mot/statistic_reports/tourism_statistics_annual_report_2012.pdf |title=Tourism Annual Report 2012 |work=Ministry of Tourism }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most visited Angkor Wat, which received over two million foreign tourists in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.phnompenhpost.com/business/ticket-sales-angkor-wat-exceed-2-million |title=Ticket sales at Angkor Wat exceed 2 million |work=The Phnom Penh Post |date= 21 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;   The site has been managed by the private [[Sokimex|SOKIMEX]] group since 1990, which rented it from the [[Cambodian government]]. The influx of tourists has so far caused relatively little damage, other than some [[graffiti]]; ropes and wooden steps have been introduced to protect the bas-reliefs and floors, respectively. Tourism has also provided some additional funds for maintenance—as of 2000 approximately 28% of ticket revenues across the whole [[Angkor]] site was spent on the temples—although most work is carried out by teams sponsored by foreign governments rather than by the Cambodian authorities.&lt;ref&gt;Tales of Asia, [http://www.talesofasia.com/cambodia-interviews-AC.htm Preserving Angkor: Interview with Ang Choulean (13 October 2000)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Since Angkor Wat has seen significant growth in tourism throughout the years, [[UNESCO]] and its International Co-ordinating Committee for the Safeguarding and Development of the Historic Site of Angkor (ICC), in association with representatives from the Royal Government and [[APSARA]], organised seminars to discuss the concept of "cultural tourism".&lt;ref name="sciencedirect.com"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.annals.2006.06.004|title=Rethinking tourism in asia|date=2007|last1=Winter|first1=Tim|journal=Annals of Tourism Research|volume=34|pages=27–44}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wanting to avoid commercial and mass tourism, the seminars emphasised the importance of providing high quality accommodation and services in order for the Cambodian government to benefit economically, while also incorporating the richness of Cambodian culture.&lt;ref name="sciencedirect.com"/&gt; In 2001, this incentive resulted in the concept of the "Angkor Tourist City" which would be developed with regard to traditional Khmer architecture, contain leisure and tourist facilities, and provide luxurious hotels capable of accommodating large numbers of tourists.&lt;ref name="sciencedirect.com"/&gt;

The prospect of developing such large tourist accommodations has encountered concerns from both APSARA and the ICC, claiming that previous tourism developments in the area have neglected construction regulations and more of these projects have the potential to damage landscape features.&lt;ref name="sciencedirect.com"/&gt; Also, the large scale of these projects have begun to threaten the quality of the nearby town's water, sewage, and electricity systems.&lt;ref name="sciencedirect.com"/&gt; It has been noted that such high frequency of tourism and growing demand for quality accommodations in the area, such as the development of a large highway, has had a direct effect on the underground water table, subsequently straining the structural stability of the temples at Angkor Wat.&lt;ref name="sciencedirect.com"/&gt; Locals of Siem Reap have also voiced concern that the charm and atmosphere of their town have been compromised in order to entertain tourism.&lt;ref name="sciencedirect.com"/&gt; Since this local atmosphere is the key component to projects like Angkor Tourist City, the local officials continue to discuss how to successfully incorporate future tourism without sacrificing local values and culture.&lt;ref name="sciencedirect.com"/&gt;

At the [[ASEAN]] Tourism Forum 2012, it was agreed that [[Borobudur]] and Angkor Wat would become sister sites and the provinces sister provinces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2012/01/13/borobudur-angkor-wat-become-sister-sites.html |title=Borobudur, Angkor Wat to become sister sites |date=13 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''bench memorandum''' (pl. ''bench memoranda'') (also known as a ''bench memo'') is a short and neutral [[Memorandum|memo]] which summarizes the facts, issues, and arguments of a [[court case]]. Bench memos are used by the judge as a reference when preparing for trial, when hearing lawyers' arguments, when drafting a decision, and to give the judge an idea of the arguments given by each side in the court case.&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20100615173822/http://www.law.mercer.edu/academics/handouts/Drafting%20Judicial%20Opinions--JFP.doc&lt;/ref&gt; Bench memos are generally written by the judge's [[law clerk]], although lawyers can also submit their own memos that argue their case, so long as their memos remain neutral.{{cn|date=October 2015}}

==Role==

During silent films, the ''benshi'' stood to the side of the screen and introduced and related the story to the audience. In theatrical style, ''benshi'' often spoke for the characters on-screen and played multiple roles. Stemming from the traditions of ''[[kabuki]]'' and ''[[Noh]]'' theaters, the benshi's narration and general commentary were an important part of the Japanese silent film experience. The ''benshi'' also provided translation for foreign (mostly American) movies.&lt;ref&gt;Standish, Isolde. ''A New History of Japanese Cinema: A Century of Narrative Film''. New York: Continuum, 2005. {{ISBN|0-8264-1709-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Much like in the West, Japanese silent films were often accompanied by live music (in addition to the ''benshi''). However, unlike Western films, which tended to have a [[theatre organ]] as accompaniment, Japanese films had a score which supported the traditional Japanese instruments of a ''kabuki'' play. Since ''benshi'' performed without external amplification, they had to carefully coordinate with the orchestra to be heard. At that time, theaters typically seated 1000, so a trademark of successful ''benshi'' was the ability to project their voices into large spaces.&lt;ref&gt;Dym, Jeffery (2008). ''A Brief History of Benshi (Silent Film Narrators)''. {{cite web |url=http://aboutjapan.japansociety.org/content.cfm/a_brief_history_of_benshi |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-04-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080504044648/http://aboutjapan.japansociety.org/content.cfm/a_brief_history_of_benshi |archivedate=2008-05-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Famous benshi active in the silent era include [[Musei Tokugawa]] (at the [[Aoikan]] and [[Musashinokan]] theaters), Saburō Somei (at the [[Denkikan]]), Rakuten Nishimura, [[Raiyū Ikoma]] (at the Teikokukan), [[Mitsugu Ōkura]], and [[Shirō Ōtsuji]].

In the 1995 film ''[[Picture Bride (film)|Picture Bride]],'' [[Toshirō Mifune]] portrays a ''benshi'' who traveled to sugar cane plantations in Hawaii during the early 20th century.

== Influence on film aesthetic ==

As the film industry and art form developed in Japan, the presence of a ''benshi'' came to be part of the film. Benshi read the intertitles on silent films and voiced all on-screen characters. Perhaps most significantly for filmmakers, ''benshi'' would add their own commentary, explaining what was happening in a shot or describing what had happened in confusing edits or sudden transitions. Some ''benshi'' were known to interpret and add to a script, for example reciting poetry to accompany a moving visual.

In addition, it was traditional for the ''benshi'' to introduce the film, even giving a brief lecture about the history of the setting. This meant that filmmakers could assume that a live narrator, accustomed to improvisation, would be present at the showing to explain scenes or even explain missing scenes or unfilmed action.

Perhaps because most early Japanese films were simply ''kabuki'' plays adapted to film, the characterization style ''benshi'' performed roles strongly influenced by the narrators in ''kabuki'' or a ''noh'' chorus—a grave, dramatic, exaggerated style. Due to the influence of ''kabuki'', audiences were not distracted by a single ''benshi'' voicing male and female roles, regardless of the gender of the ''benshi''.

== Influence on film industry ==

In 1927, there were 6,818 ''benshi'', including 180 women.&lt;ref&gt;Cook, David A. (1990). ''A History of Narrative Film'', New York: W. W. Norton &amp; Company. {{ISBN|0-393-95553-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Many ''benshi'' were famous in their own right and garnered great acclaim. The presence of a ''benshi'' was the aspect of the film presentation that drew in the audience, more so than the actors appearing in the film, and promotional posters would frequently include a photo of the ''benshi'' announcing the movie.

The silent film era lasted until the mid-1930s in Japan in part due to ''benshi'', despite the [[sound film|introduction of sound]] in full-length films in the late 1920s. The adoption of this new technology was slowed by the popularity and influence of the ''benshi'' (in addition to the high costs to the cinemas and production companies). Though the tradition has mostly faded, there are a few remaining active ''benshi'' in Japan (e.g., [[Midori Sawato]]).

== Benshi in other cultures  ==

* The ''benshi'' tradition was adopted in [[Cinema of Taiwan|Taiwan]] under the name ''piansu'' ({{zh|c=辯士|poj=piān-sū}}).
* ''Benshi'' were present in [[Cinema of Korea|Korea]] from the first decade of the twentieth century where they were called "byeonsa" (변사).&lt;ref&gt;Maliangkay, Roald H.

* In the [[Soviet Union|USSR]], during the early years of the Brezhnev era, the availability of foreign films was severely restricted. [[Goskino|The USSR State Committee for Cinematography]] held closed-door screenings of many Western films, open mainly to workers in the film industry, politicians, and other members of the elite. Those screenings were interpreted simultaneously by interpreters who specialized in films, where an effective conveyance of humour, idioms, and other subtleties of speech were required. Some of the most prolific "[[Gavrilov translation|Gavrilov translators]]" began their careers at such screenings.

== New benshi practice(s) ==

The underlying concept of benshi, live narration of film, continues to work its way into performance practices. The actual practice of "benshi" is most commonly referenced in relation to live film narration largely due to it having been and when the practice was more formalized and financed. As evidenced by the (above) listings of "benshi" in other cultures, the art of cinema accompanied by a live performer was as international then as it is now. 

There are groups in the United States seeking to revive this form and to continue exploring the possibilities of altering the form in the spirit of experimentation from which the practice emerged.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}} Likewise, new attempts to subvert traditional notions of storytelling and film watching are underway. Some performers interject commentary into films, drawing from a century of social critique, often presenting popular films along with new dialog and narrative intended to juxtapose their ideas with those of the audience. While some have adopted the term "[[Neo-Benshi]]", other performers have chosen to adopt the title "movieteller" as an alternative. They believe it emphasizes the multicultural past and future(s) of the form, while inviting further experimentation with the medium, such as a live narration of one's own films, the implementation of instruments as narrative devices, or any instance where a human contingent mediates between an audience and an image.

'''Blaenavon Ironworks''' is a former industrial site which is now a [[museum]] in [[Blaenavon]] in [[Wales]].  The ironworks was of crucial importance in the development of the ability to use cheap, low quality, high sulphur iron ores worldwide.  It was the site of the experiments by [[Sidney Gilchrist Thomas]] and his cousin [[Percy Gilchrist]] that led to "the basic steel process" or "[[Gilchrist-Thomas process]]".

The ironworks is on the outskirts of [[Blaenavon]], in the borough of [[Torfaen]], within the [[Blaenavon Industrial Landscape]], a [[World Heritage Site]].

The site is under the care of [[Cadw]], the Welsh Government's historic environment service.

== History of the works ==
[[File:Blaenafon Ironworks -two furnaces-24May2008.jpg|thumb|Two furnaces]]
[[File:View of iron works, Blaeavon.jpeg|thumb|left|View of the iron works, 1800]]
The land on which the Ironworks reside was at one time the property of [[Lord Abergavenny]] and was leased in 1787 by three Midlands businessmen, [[Thomas Hill of Dennis|Thomas Hill]], his brother-in-law Thomas Hopkins and Benjamin Pratt.&lt;ref name=ironworks&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://welshjournals.llgc.org.uk/browse/viewpage/llgc-id:1337678/llgc-id:1340124/llgc-id:1340193/getText|title= Big Pit, Blaenavon-A New Chronology?|author=Evans, J. A. H.|work=Gwent Local History|publisher=Gwent Local History Council|date=Spring 2000|page=4|accessdate=14 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Work constructing the Ironworks began immediately and included several "luxury" cottages. Blaenavon Ironworks was the first to be designed as a multi-furnace site from the outset,&lt;ref name=underground&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.questia.com/read/1G1-342132737/going-underground-big-pit-national-coal-museum-is|title=Going Underground; Big Pit: National Coal Museum Is Celebrating Its 30th Anniversary as a Tourist Attraction and Museum|author=McCrum, Kirstie|publisher=Western Mail|date=7 September 2013|accessdate=14 June 2016|subscription=yes|via=[[Questia]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; with three furnaces, [[calcining]] kilns, cottages, and a company shop.

Archdeacon Coxe visited Blaenavon during 1798–99 and enthusiastically described the small town as ''an opulent and increasing establishment'', which was ''surrounded with heaps of ore, coal and limestone''.&lt;ref&gt;Coxe, W. (1801) An Historical Tour of Monmouthshire.&lt;/ref&gt; The reason for the growth of Blaenavon from a rural to an industrial community lay in the rich mineral deposits found in the surrounding area, which outcropped at the surface making extraction a relatively cheap process. The iron works demanded a skilled and permanent labour force, which the Eastern Valley of Monmouthshire lacked. Previous iron works at nearby Pontypool, for instance, had relied on charcoal and water.

The nature of the work introduced to Blaenavon was different. The changes involved the coal-using technology and the application of steam power, not used until that time in the Eastern Valley.&lt;ref&gt;Atkinson, M., and Baber, C., (1987) The Growth and Decline of the South Wales Iron Industry: 1760–1880, pp36-45&lt;/ref&gt; Skilled workers came mainly from West Wales, Staffordshire, Gloucestershire, Herefordshire, Somerset and Ireland. Unskilled men, often with families came for the promise of work. The population of the district expanded from a little over 1,000 in 1800&lt;ref&gt;Coxe, W., (1801) An Historical Tour in Monmouthshire, Part 2, p.228.&lt;/ref&gt; to 5115 in 1840 with 61% speaking Welsh and the remainder English.&lt;ref&gt;Reports to the Commissioners on the Employment of Children (1841) p.610.&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1800 Blaenavon Ironworks contributed greatly to South Wales becoming the foremost iron-producing region in the world. Production at Blaenavon was second only to [[Cyfarthfa Ironworks]] in [[Merthyr Tydfil]], the largest iron producer in Wales.&lt;ref name=underground/&gt; Two new furnaces were added over the next decade and in 1804 a forge was constructed in nearby [[Cwmavon, Torfaen|Cwmavon]]. By 1833 the company owned 430 houses and employed 1000 workers but suffered economic boom-and-bust that accompanied iron-making with wage cuts, strikes and the emergence of "[[Scotch Cattle]]".

[[File:Blaenafon Iron Furnace -chimney-24May2008.jpg.jpg|thumb|left|Furnace chimney]]
In 1836, the works was bought by the '''Blaenavon Iron and Coal Company,'''&lt;ref name=ironworks/&gt; financed by Londoner [[Robert Kennard]], later an MP. Led by new managing director [[James Ashwell]], a huge investment was made in the ironworks, including the construction of the impressive Balance tower which utilised a [[funicular|water displacement lift]] to carry [[pig iron]] from the base of the site to the [[Brecknock and Abergavenny Canal]] system, which offered lower tolls to Newport than the [[Monmouthshire Canal]]. After this £138,000 investment the site showed little sign of profit and so Ashwell was forced to resign in 1840.&lt;ref name=ironworks2&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://welshjournals.llgc.org.uk/browse/viewpage/llgc-id:1337678/llgc-id:1340124/llgc-id:1340193/getText|title= Big Pit, Blaenavon-A New Chronology?|author=Evans, J. A. H.|work=Gwent Local History|publisher=Gwent Local History Council|date=Spring 2000|page=7|accessdate=14 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the following years, iron rails produced at Blaenavon were exported all over the world, including India, Russia and Brazil but also in projects closer to home such as the construction of [[Crumlin Viaduct]].

When Ashwell resigned, Mr. Scrivener became manager of the works and production picked up for a short while. In 1845 sales reached a peak of 35,549 tons out of which 20,732 tons were sold. This was a rise of 5,000 tons on sales for the previous year. However, fluidity was uncertain. By 1847 sales had declined to 18,981 tons.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, S.A. Blaenavon Iron Works 1837–1880, Gwent County Record Office, MISC.MSS.1066.&lt;/ref&gt; The works continued to suffer. A lower amount of pig iron was produced in 1849, partly due to the furnaces being out of action for three months. However, it was claimed that this was the consequence of ''workmen refusing to submit to a reduction in wages, which the depressed state of the iron industry had rendered necessary''.&lt;ref&gt;Minutes, Blaenavon Iron and Coal Company, 27 April 1849&lt;/ref&gt;

The company was relaunched in 1870 as the Blaenavon Iron &amp; Steel Company and was one of only six south Wales ironworks that successfully made the change to steel production. By 1878 the company employed 5,000 people but had greatly overreached itself financially and failed amongst tough competition. With financial ruin just around the corner the company was given some respite thanks to the discoveries of [[Sidney Gilchrist Thomas]] and [[Percy Gilchrist|Percy Carlyle Gilchrist]] which enabled the use of the previously uneconomic phosphoric iron ore. Their experiments were carried out at Blarnavon between 1877 and 1878.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://www.questia.com/read/808906/history-of-the-british-steel-industry|title=History of the British Steel Industry|last1=Carr|first1=J. C.|last2=Taplin|first2=W.|year=1962|publisher=Harvard University Press Cambridge|accessdate=18 June 2015|pages=99–101|subscription=yes|via=[[Questia]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was short lived as it meant Germany and North America were now able to utilise their own phosphoric ores and ironically accelerated the decline of Blaenavon Ironworks.

[[File:Blaenafon Water Balance Tower-24May2008.jpg|thumb|Water balance tower]]
In 1880 the Blaenavon Company opened [[Big Pit]] &lt;ref name=ironworks3&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://welshjournals.llgc.org.uk/browse/viewpage/llgc-id:1337678/llgc-id:1340124/llgc-id:1340193/getText|title= Big Pit, Blaenavon-A New Chronology?|author=Evans, J. A. H.|work=Gwent Local History|publisher=Gwent Local History Council|date=Spring 2000|page=11|accessdate=14 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and moved away from iron production. In 1904 the ironworks finally ceased production, restarting briefly in 1924 but was unsustainable. The forges at the site were still being used and helped with the production of steel shell during both world wars but was mostly used as a storage yard for the National Coal Board.

In 1959 novelist [[Alexander Cordell]] set his most famous novel, ''[[Rape of the Fair Country]]'' at the Ironworks and the surrounding area at the height of the industrial revolution. At around the same time, industrial archaeology began to emerge as a discipline and the site was spared the fate of so many other 18th–19th century industrial works. In 1974 the conservation of the ironworks began. Shortly after statutory protection was provided for various sites in Blaenavon including the Ironworks.

In 2000 Blaenavon was awarded [[World Heritage Site]] status&lt;ref name=underground/&gt; for the industrial landscape including the Ironworks and are now under the care of [[Cadw]] and open as one of only two free admission staffed sites.

In 2001, the structure underwent a major restructuring. The 160-year old cast iron columns at the top of the tower were taken down and the iron frame was casted and painted in order to ensure that it stayed intact now that it was a World Heritage Site.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-80259490.html|title=Heritage Landmark to Be Repaired; BLAENAVON: Ironworks Tower Removed for First Time in More Than 160 Years|last=|first=|date=November 23, 2001|website=|publisher=Western Mail {{subscription required|via=HighBeam}}|access-date=September 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The blast furnaces, Cast House, Foundry and Balance Tower are Grade I [[listed building]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britishlistedbuildings.co.uk/wales/torfaen/blaenavon Listed Buildings in Blaenavon, Torfaen, Wales], britishlistedbuildings.co.uk.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Coal House==
[[File:733672 ba112161-by-Alan-Bowring.jpg|thumb|right|Stack Square was where the ''Coal House'' series was filmed]]
[[Coal House]] was a reality TV series shown one [[BBC One Wales]]. In October 2007 three Welsh families were transported back to the south Wales coalfield of the 1920s. The Stack Square cottages located at the Ironworks were transformed into authentic 1927 coal mining family homes.

In October 2008 this series was followed by Coal House at War where three new families were transported back to the second world war era conditions of 1944. This time they were joined by evacuees and Bevin Boys.

The furnished cottages used for both series are open to the public at the Ironworks.

'''Brigade Media''', also known as '''Brigade''', is a civic technology [[computing platform|platform]] that was formed on June 4, 2014, and founded by James Windon, Jason Putorti, John Thrall, Matt Mahan, and Miche Capone. The platform is intended to serve as a way for users to connect with others who share the same or similar views and voice their opinions, create [[debates]], or organize [[petitions]]. This process is intended to make the users' concerns more visible to and influential towards United States' [[policymakers]].

==Leadership==

James Wendon is the [[President (corporate title)|President]] of the Brigade platform. He previously acted as the [[Vice president (corporate title)|Vice President]] of Causes and earlier worked with the [[World Trade Organization]] in Switzerland. Matt Mahan is the [[CEO]] of Brigade and previously served as the [[CEO]] of [[Causes (company)|Causes]]. John Thrall works in [[Engineering]], Jason Putorti works in [[Design]], and Miche Capone specializes in [[Production (economics)|Production]]. [[Sean Parker]] is the [[Chairman]] of the [[startup company|startup]]. He sits on the board of [[Spotify]] and was the founding president of [[Facebook]].&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{cite web|author=Sifry, Micah|language=en-US|title=Charge of the Light Brigade: Is Sean Parker's Civic Startup Too Male and White?|url=http://techpresident.com/news/25152/charge-light-brigade-sean-parkers-civic-startup-too-male-and-white|website=techpresident.com|access-date=2018-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{cite web|title=Meet Brigade President James Windon|author=Delargy, Christine|access-date=2014-04-10|website=The Washington Post|language=en-US|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-live/wp/2015/11/13/meet-brigade-president-james-windon/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
=== 2014-2016: Private Beta ===
On June 4th, 2014, Brigade Beta became available to download on [[iOS]] or [[Google Play]], in its private [[beta]] version.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In this beginning stage, the app asked users to agree or disagree on a position.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Brigade then split up its users into those who agreed on the issue and those who disagreed on the issue. Participants were also allowed to write their own opinions on positions and ask those in their respective group if they were "for" or "against" the opinion stated.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite web|language=en-US|title=Sean Parker’s new political app Brigade has launched in private beta|author= Wright, Mic|access-date=2018-04-10|website=thenextweb.com|url=https://thenextweb.com/apps/2015/06/17/sean-parkers-new-political-app-brigade-has-launched-in-private-beta/?via=indexdotco}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2016-present: Open Beta  ===
==== Voter guide ====
A few weeks before the November 2016 elections, Brigade created a ballot [[guide]] for its users.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; It ran these voter guides in [[San Francisco]] and [[Manchester, New Hampshire|Manchester]], New Hampshire.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{citeweb|language=en-US|title=Brigade, The Political Engagement Platform Backed By Sean Parker, Launches A Voter Guide For Nov. Elections|author= Cutler, Kim-Mai|url=https://techcrunch.com/2015/10/12/brigade/?via=indexdotco|website=TechCrunch|access-date=2018-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the user entered the [[Application software|application]], he or she was prompted with questions regarding [[government]] and [[social]] issues. One could agree, disagree, or click unsure as their answer choices.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{cite web|language=en-US|title=Brigade tries to provide a simple solution to elections, but is it too simple?|author= Hockenson, Lauren|website=thenextweb.com|url=https://thenextweb.com/apps/2015/10/14/brigade-tries-to-provide-a-simple-solution-to-elections-but-is-it-too-simple/?via=indexdotco|access-date=2018-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; After completing the questionnaire, the guide gave recommendations on who to vote for and which [[propositions]] to pass or not pass.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Furthermore, the app also determined these choices based on those a user socializes with on Brigade.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{cite web|language=en-US|title=Brigade launches first of its kind social ballot guide for U.S. voters|website=brigade.news|url=https://brigade.news/brigade-launches-first-of-its-kind-social-ballot-guide-for-u-s-voters-21a69c7f6a75|access-date=2018-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brigade users could then pledge their votes to the candidates and propositions listed on the ballot. With these pledges, the app could track which candidates had more pledged votes in real time.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Users were further able to recruit pledges from other users for their favorite candidates or propositions.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

==== Voter verification==== 
Brigade implemented a voter [[Third-party verification|verification]] service as well.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{cite web|language=en-US|title=
With voter verification, Brigade becomes a more legitimate platform for political debate|author=Cutler, Kim-Mai|website=TechCrunch|url=https://techcrunch.com/2016/06/21/brigade-voter-verification/?via=indexdotco|access-date=2018-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; With voter verification, a user can determine how similar or different a political representative's viewpoints are from their own.&lt;ref name=":8"/&gt; This data was received from [[Google API|Google's Civic API]] with geographic information on 520,000 American elected officials.&lt;ref name=":8"/&gt;

==== Acquisitions ====

Brigade Media has acquired [[Causes_(company)|Causes]],[[Votizen]], and Voter.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://tech.co/brigade-acquires-votizen-and-causes-2014-06|title=Brigade Media Acquires Causes and Votizens, Adds Tons of Executives|website=Tech.co|language=en-US|author=Schmidt, Will|access-date=2018-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite web|title=Brigade acquires politics matchmaking service Voter, plans to shutter service later this year|url=https://venturebeat.com/2017/01/23/brigade-acquires-politics-matchmaking-service-voter-plans-to-shutter-service-later-this-year/?via=indexdotco|website=venturebeat.com|language=en-US|author=Yeung, Ken|access-date=2018-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|language=en-US|author=Wilhelm, Alex|title=Brigade Media Acquires Causes In Its Quest To Revitalize American Democracy|url=https://techcrunch.com/2014/06/11/sean-parkers-brigade-media-acquires-causes-in-its-quest-to-revitalize-american-democracy/|website=TechCrunch|access-date=2018-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of its acquisition, Causes was the largest [[online]] platform where candidates could [[Political campaign|campaign]].&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; At the time of its acquisition, Votizen functioned as a [[tool]] for voters to learn more about their leaders.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; At the time of its acquisition, Voter aimed to put voters and politicians together via shared viewpoints.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; These three companies helped Brigade gain [[social media]] presence and find intelligent [[workers]] in the field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|language=en-US|title=Brigade Welcomes Voter Founder &amp; CEO

===Background===
As technology has advanced, it was assumed that the average individual would have further access to voting, and therefore, voting numbers would increase. Instead, voter turnout at the elections remains low, with numbers at the presidential elections between 50% and 60% of the US population in the last 50 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Voter Turnout in Presidential Elections: 1828 - 2012|author= Peters, Gerhard and Woolley, John T.|url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/data/turnout.php|website=presidency.ucsb.edu|access-date=2018-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the midterm election of 2014, only 36.4% of people voted, the lowest percentage since 1942.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Voter Turnout in Midterm Elections Hits 72-Year Low|author= Alter, Charlotte|url=http://time.com/3576090/midterm-elections-turnout-world-war-two/|website=Time|access-date=2018-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is hoped that civic technology will incentivize and educate its users to vote. Brigade's voter ballot was an attempt as a [[Civic technology|civic technology platform]] to increase voter participation as well as educate its users about candidates and propositions.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The tools we build in Silicon Valley represent the best hope for fixing our democracy|author=Mahan Matt|url=https://www.recode.net/2017/2/1/14476462/civic-tech-organize-march-change-citizen-engagement-democracy-brigade|website=recode.net|access-date=2018-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mission==
One mission of Brigade Media is to act as a [[foreground]] for its users to connect and organize so that they can voice their opinions on our nation's issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Brigade Media|url=https://parker.org/initiatives/brigade-media|website=parker.org|access-date=2018-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another more general goal is to increase voter participation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sean Parker forms Brigade Media to charge politics|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2014/06/11/sean-parker-brigade-politics/10326463/|website=usatoday.com|author=Guynn, Jessica|access-date=2018-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Functionality==
Brigade interacts with American [[voters]] by linking its users to the same held concerns.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite web|language=en-US|title=Brigade-Make Change Into Action|url=https://brigade.com|website=brigade.com|access-date=2018-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The opinions of [[elected officials]] on those concerns will be provided and metrics about the [[candidate]] most similar in concerns and degree of concern will be available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Brigade Seeks To Reboot Political Engagement In America With Civic Social Media|author= Howard, Alexander|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/alexander-howard/brigade-seeks-to-reboot-political-engagement_b_7607306.html|website=huffingtonpost|access-date=2018-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; This data should be useful for both candidates and voters, in that voters can voice their grievances and candidates must respond accordingly.

==Funding==
In 2014, Brigade Media received about $9.5 million in [[seed money]] from [[Sean Parker]], [[Marc Benioff]], and [[Ron Conway]].&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Introducing Brigade Beta, Sean Parker's civic-focused social network|url=https://mashable.com/2015/06/17/sean-parker-brigade-beta-civics-social/?via=indexdotco#lp4nVNPhzuqj|author=Mangalindan, JP|website=mashable.com|access-date=2018-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Brigade Media Raises $9.3M From Sean Parker To Shake Up American Democracy|url=https://techcrunch.com/2014/04/14/brigade-media-raises-9-3m-from-sean-parker-to-shake-up-american-democracy/|author=Wilhelm, Alex|website=TechCrunch|access-date=2018-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism and controversy==

===Criticism===
[[Barbara Simons]], a [[computer scientist]] from [[IBM]], asserts that all current forms of digital voting devices are hackable, and that the best unhackable option is paper.&lt;ref name=":22"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Computer Scientist Who Prefers Paper|access-date=2014-04-17|website=theatlantic.com|language=en-US|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2017/12/guardian-of-the-vote/544155/}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Furthermore, a Canadian study revealed that online voting platforms may not improve voter participation.&lt;ref name=":21" /&gt; The study found that those who did not already vote on paper ballots did not vote with digital devices.&lt;ref name=":21" /&gt; Instead, non-paper voting forms are simply more convenient for those who would have already decided to vote.&lt;ref name=":21"&gt;{{cite web|title=Is Now the Time for Internet Voting?:BC’s Independent Panel on Internet Voting|access-date=2014-04-17|website=revparl.ca|language=en-US|author=Archer, Keith|url=http://www.revparl.ca/37/4/37n4e_14_Archer.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; With this [[data]] brought to light, the Independent Panel On Internet Voting did not recommend internet voting to the [[Legislative Assembly of British Columbia]] in 2012.&lt;ref name=":20"&gt;{{cite web|title=Independent Election Task Force Report: 2017 Jun 28|access-date=2014-04-17|website=council.vancouver.ca|language=en-US|url=http://council.vancouver.ca/20170628/documents/pspc1.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Controversy===
Brigade's [[Executive Chairman]], [[Sean Parker]], was the [[President (corporate title)|president]] of [[Facebook]] in mid-2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Students' Start-up Draws Attention and $13 Million|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/05/26/business/students-startup-draws-attention-and-13-million.html|author=Rosen, Ellen|website=NYTimes|access-date=2018-04-19|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recently, [[Facebook]] sold information on over 50 million Facebook users to [[Cambridge Analytica]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How Trump Consultants Exploited the Facebook Data of Millions|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/17/us/politics/cambridge-analytica-trump-campaign.html|author=Rosenberg, Matthew, Confessore, Nicholas, and Cadwalldr, Carole |website=NYTimes|access-date=2018-04-19|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sean Parker's previous relationship with Facebook could provide controversy in his work with Brigade Media and his other projects.

At the company's formation, Brigade Media also faced a [[racial]] controversy. When Brigade was only a few weeks old, the entire [[Leadership|leadership division]] of the [[start-up]] was white males.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; The company addressed the issues by filling in 12 additional positions and noting that women were also present in the [[organization]].&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

==Results==

When the ballot guide was introduced, about 67% of its users were [[millennials]].&lt;ref name=":24" /&gt; This is an accomplishment because millennial participation in the [[United States elections, 2014|2014 midterm elections]] had declined.&lt;ref name=":24"&gt;{{cite web|title=Election Results Are In on Sean Parker's Brigade App: Millennial Voters Used It|url=https://www.recode.net/2015/11/5/11620390/election-results-are-in-on-sean-parkers-brigade-app-millennial-voters|author=Chmielewski, Dawn|website=recode.net|access-date=2018-04-19|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of the ballot guide, the [[start-up]] had 100,000 pledged candidates and 400,000 friends of candidates also pledged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Brigade Launches First of Its Kind Social Ballot Guide for U.S. Voters|url=https://brigade.news/brigade-launches-first-of-its-kind-social-ballot-guide-for-u-s-voters-21a69c7f6a75|website=brigade.news|access-date=2018-04-19|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The platforms data also saw [[Donald Trump]] winning swing states before the polls in the [[United States presidential election, 2016|2016 United States Presidential Election]].&lt;ref name=":25"&gt;{{cite web|title=An App Called Brigade Saw Trump Winning Swing States When Polls Didn't|access-date=2014-04-17|website=npr.org|language=en-US|author=Shahani, Aarti|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/alltechconsidered/2016/11/10/501613521/an-app-saw-trump-winning-swing-states-when-polls-didnt}}&lt;/ref&gt; At this time, Brigade had 200,000 [[verified]] users. Within the vote pledges, 94.5% of [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] pledged to vote for Republican nominee Trump, with 2.2% pledging with Democratic nominee [[Hillary Clinton]].&lt;ref name=":25" /&gt; However, on the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] pledge side, only 55% pledged for Clinton while 40% of Democrats pledged for Trump.&lt;ref name=":25" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3923">[[Image:Capitoline Antinous Musei Capitolini MC741 n2.jpg|thumb|The Capitoline Antinous]]
The '''Capitoline 'Antinous'''' is a marble statue of a young nude male found at [[Hadrian's Villa]], [[Tivoli, Italy|Tivoli]],&lt;ref&gt;This provenance from the ''Museo Capitolino, o sia descrizione delle statue'' (Rome 1750), compiled by Giovanni Pietro Lucatelli, is noted in Francis Haskell and Nicholas Penny, ''Taste and the Antique: The Lure of Classical Sculpture 1500-1900'' (Yale University Press) 1981:143.&lt;/ref&gt; during the time when Conte [[Giuseppe Fede]] was undertaking the earliest concerted excavations there.&lt;ref&gt;As early as 1724, Conte Giuseppe Fede had been buying up parcels of land in the extensive villa, which had become divided up among a multitude of owners; for the early career and reputation of the ''Capitoline 'Antinous' '', see Haskell and Penny 1981: cat. no 5, pp 143f, and ''passim''&lt;/ref&gt; It was bought before 1733 by [[Alessandro Albani|Alessandro Cardinal Albani]].&lt;ref&gt;When it was inventoried in Cardinal Albani's collection by the sculptor [[Agostino Cornacchini]], who rated it priceless and worthy of ranking with the best antiquities (noted Haskell and Penny 1981:144.&lt;/ref&gt; To contemporaries it seemed to be the real attraction of his collection.&lt;ref&gt;Haskell and Penny's phrase, (1981:64) based on contemporary accounts, published and private.&lt;/ref&gt; The statue was bought by [[Pope Clement XII]] in 1733 and went on to form the nucleus of the [[Capitoline Museums]], Rome, where it remains. The restored left leg and the left arm, with its unexpected rhetorical hand gesture, were provided by [[Pietro Bracci]].&lt;ref&gt;Haskell and Penny 1981:143.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 18th century it was considered to be one of the most beautiful Roman copies of a Greek statue in the world. It was then thought to represent [[Hadrian]]'s lover [[Antinous]] owing to its fleshy face and physique and downturned look.  It was part of the artistic loot taken to Paris under the terms of the [[Treaty of Tolentino]] (1797) and remained in Paris 1800-15, when it was returned to Rome after the fall of Napoleon.  

In part due to its hair being unlike that in better-attested Antinous-types, which closely follow a very few iconographic models, it is now considered&lt;ref&gt;''E.g.'' in Wolfgang Helbig, ''Führer durch die öffentlichen Sammlungen klassischer Altertümen in Rom'' 1963-72, II:230f.&lt;/ref&gt; to be a Roman Imperial era copy of an early 4th century BC Greek statue of [[Hermes]].  Such a change of identification was already underway before 1900, when [[Augustus Hare]] observed in his ''Walks in Rome'' that :
{{cquote|"[the statue's] identity has only once, I think, been seriously challenged; and yet it may be reckoned more than doubtful.  The head is almost certainly not [Antinous's].  How it came to be placed upon a body presenting so much resemblance to the type of Antinous, I do not know.  Careful comparison of the torso and the arms will even raise the question whether this fine statue is not a Hermes or a hero of an earlier age [than Antinous]."&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=aikLAAAAYAAJ&amp;q=%22Capitoline+Antinous%22+-Wikipedia&amp;dq=%22Capitoline+Antinous%22+-Wikipedia&amp;pgis=1 A.J.C. Hare, ''Walks in Rome'' (1900)], also cited in [https://books.google.com/books?id=BaAEAAAAYAAJ&amp;q=%22Capitoline+Antinous%22+-Wikipedia&amp;dq=%22Capitoline+Antinous%22+-Wikipedia&amp;pgis=1 ''Familiar Allusions'']&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The '''Chinookan languages''' were a small family of languages spoken in [[Oregon]] and [[Washington (state)|Washington]] along the [[Columbia River]] by [[Chinook people]]s. All are now extinct, although [[Upper Chinook language|Upper Chinook]] had 270 self-identified speakers in 2009-2013.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/data/tables/2013/demo/2009-2013-lang-tables.html|title=Detailed Languages Spoken at Home and Ability to Speak English|date=|website=www.census.gov|publisher=US Census Bureau|language=en-US|access-date=2017-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family division==
Chinookan consisted of three languages with multiple [[Variety (linguistics)|varieties]]. There is some dispute over classification, and there are two [[ISO 639-3]] codes assigned: [http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=chh chh] (Chinook, Lower Chinook) and [http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=wac wac] (Wasco-Wishram, Upper Chinook). For example, Ethnologue 15e classifies Kiksht as Lower Chinook, while others consider it instead Upper Chinook ([https://archive.is/20121221034507/http://listserv.linguistlist.org/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind0201e&amp;L=chinook&amp;F=P&amp;P=1590 discussion]), and others a separate language.

The vowels in the Chinookan languages are /a i ɛ ə u/ as followed. Stress is marked as /á/.

==Morphology==
As in many North American Languages, verbs constitute complete clauses in themselves. Nominal may accompany the verbs, but they have adjunct status, functioning as appositives to the pronominal affixes. Word order functions purely pragmatically; constituents appear in decreasing order of newsworthiness. Clauses are combined by juxtaposition or particles, rather than subordinating inflection.

Verbs contain an initial tense or aspect prefix, ergative pronominal prefix, obligatory assaultive prefixed, dative prefix, reflexive/reciprocal/middle, adverbial, directional, and verb stem. The number of tense/aspect prefix distinctions varies among the languages. Kiksht shows six way tense distinctions: mythic past, remote past, recent past, immediate past, present, and future.

The pronominal prefixes are obligatory, whether free nominals occur in the clause-or not. Three can be seen in the Kathlamet verb. The ergative refers to agent of a transitive verb, the absolutive to patient of a transitive or single argument of an intransitive, the dative to indirect object. Reflexive prefixes can serve as reciprocals and as medio-passives. When the reflexive follows can ergative-absolutive pronoun sequence, it indicates that one indirectly affected is the same as the ergative. When it follows an absolutive –dative pronoun sequence, it indicates that one indirectly affected is associated with the absolutive, perhaps as the whole in a part-whole relationship, or the owner.

Verbs stems may be simplex or compound, the second member indicating direction, including motion out of, from open to cover especially from water to shore or inland, from cover to open, especially toward water, into, down or up.

Suffixes include repetitive, causatives, an involuntary passive, completive, stative, purposive, future, usitative, successful completive and so on.

Nouns contain an initial prefix, pronominal prefix, positive prefix, inner normalizer, root, a qualifying suffix, plural, and final suffix. Initial prefix serve primarily as nominalizers. Masculine prefixes appear with nouns designating male persons, feminine with those denoting female persons. The neuter may indicate indefiniteness. All are used for nouns referring to objects as well. Masculine prefixes appear with the large animals; feminine for small ones. Masculine prefixes also appear with nouns expressing qualities.

==Gender/number/person==
The gender/number prefixes is followed by possessive pronominal prefixes of the verb. These distinguish first, inclusive, second, third, fourth (indefinite) person, dual and plural possessors. The possessive prefixes are followed by noun stem, perhaps including another nominalizer. Nominal suffixes indicate emphasis or contrast, specificity, succession in time, definiteness, plurality, and time, location, or similarity.

The possessive prefixes are followed by noun stem, perhaps including another nominalizer. Nominal suffixes indicate emphasis or contrast, specificity, succession in time, definiteness, plurality, and time, location, or similarity.

1. The possessive prefix for the third person singular feminine ("her") is –ga- when the noun itself is feminine, neuter, dual, or plural, it is preceded by the gender-number prefixes:

but is-tca- when the noun itself is masculine, is preceded by the  gender-number prefix: 
{| class="wikitable"
! 
! Lower Chinook
! Wishram
! 
! 
|-
| sing.fem
| ʋ̄
| style="font-style: italic;" | (w)ɑ-

| 
|-
| neut.
| L-
| ii-
| 
| 
|-
| du.
| c-,s-
| (ic-,is-)
| 
| 
|}

2. The possessive prefix for the first person singular "my" is –gE (Wishram-g-,-k-;- x̩
-before k-stops) when the noun is feminine, neuter, dual or plural, but –tcE-,-tci-(Wishram-tc-) when the noun is masculine.

3. Aside from certain secondary irregularities in the third person dual and third person plural which don't concern us, the pronominal subject of the transitive verb differs from the pronominal subject of the intransitive verb only in the case of the third person singular masculine and third persoonsingular feminine, the difference between the two sets of forms being for the most part indicated  by position and, in part, by the use of a "postpronominal" particle-g-which indicates that the preceding pronominal element is used as the subject of a transitive verb.

The phonetic parallelism would then be perfect in the three cases. If we compare the theoretical forms *ag-"she"and *itc-"he"with the remaining subjective forms of the transitive verb, we obtain at once a perfectly regular and intelligible set of forms. Including the "post-pronominal"-g-, the system is as follows:

{| class="wikitable"
! colspan="2" | 1st pers. sing.
! n-
|-
| 
| exclusive dual
| nt-g-
|-
| 
| exclusive plural
| nc-g-
|-

| lx-g-
|-
| 
| inclusive plural
| lx-g-
|-

|-

| mt-g-

|-
| 
| sing.neut
| l-g-
|-
| 
| dual.
| c-g-
|-
| 
| plural
| l-g-
|}

Compare these pronominal prefixes with the corresponding intransitive subjects and transitive objects:

The original [[Chinook Jargon]] was a simplified language, originally used as a second language by speakers of other Native American languages in the area. It has sentence-initial negation which is atypical of regional languages and doesn't have typical complex morphology. It has SVO structure: Chinookan and Salishan are VSO, e.g., Haias olo tso naika  [much hungry water I]  "I'm very thirsty". However, local Athabaskan languages are SOV, so this is probably a result of contact &amp;ndash; a cross-language compromise. Only later did [[Chinook Jargon]] acquire significant English and French lexical items.

==Sociolinguistics==

There were Lower and Upper Chinookan groups, only a single variety of the latter now survives: Wasco-Wishram (Wasco and Wishram were originally two separate, similar varieties). In 1990,  there were 69&amp;nbsp;speakers (7&amp;nbsp;monolinguals) of Wasco-Wishram; in 2001, 5&amp;nbsp;speakers of Wasco remained; the last fully fluent speaker, Gladys Thompson, died in 2012.

Chinook-speaking groups were once powerful in trade, before and during early European contact ([[Lewis and Clark Expedition|Lewis &amp; Clark]]), hence developed the Chinook Jargon &amp;ndash; a pre-European contact language, with lexicon from at least Chinook, Chehalis, and Nootka or Nuu-chah-nulth.

Chinook people were quickly diminished by European diseases: Numbered around 800&amp;nbsp;persons in 1800; they mixed with Chehalis (in fact, the very word ''Chinook'' is a Chehalis word for those who lived on the south of the river). Most of the language family became extinct as separate groups by 1900, except a few hundreds who mixed with other groups. Around 120&amp;nbsp;people in 1945, though some 609 were reported in the 1970s, having by then mixed extensively with other groups. Language is now extinct.

[[Chinook Jargon]] also flourished from 1790s&amp;ndash;1830s, then experienced a flood of English and French new vocabulary. It was used by up to 100,000&amp;nbsp;speakers of 100&amp;nbsp;mother tongues in the 19th&amp;nbsp;century. Then declined, was recorded by linguists in the 1930s, and died out by the early 1900s. The Chinook people were finally recognized by the US Govt. in Jan. 2001, but in the 90-day grace period the Quinault Tribe filed an appeal stating that the Chinook Nation made mistakes when applying for federal recognition.

'''Citizens' Party''' ({{lang-fi|Kansalaispuolue}}, {{lang-sv|Medborgarpartiet}}) is a [[Finland|Finnish]] political party, founded in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.iltalehti.fi/uutiset/201612152200041020_uu.shtml|title=Paavo Väyrysen kansalaispuolue puoluerekisteriin |work=Iltalehti |date=15 December 2016 |accessdate=1 January 2017|language=fi}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was founded by the long-time [[Centre Party (Finland)|Centre Party]] politician and [[Member of the European Parliament|MEP]] [[Paavo Väyrynen]], who left Centre in early 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.iltasanomat.fi/kotimaa/art-1454558309546.html|title=Paavo Väyrynen perustaa uuden puolueen|publisher=Ilta-sanomat|date=4 February 2016|accessdate=1 January 2017|language=fi}}&lt;/ref&gt; Väyrynen acted as the first chairman of the party until July 2017, when he was succeeded by Sami Kilpeläinen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.suomenmaa.fi/?app=NeoDirect&amp;com=6/3/263315/bd51d38702 |title= Kansalaispuolueessa on vain noin 30 päätösvaltaista jäsentä – tuore puheenjohtaja Sami Kilpeläinen aikoo jättää keskustan luottamustehtävät |publisher=Suomenmaa |date=17 July 2017 |accessdate=17 July 2017 |language=Finnish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The party did not take part in the [[Finnish municipal elections, 2017|2017 municipal elections]], although Väyrynen was elected to the [[City Council of Helsinki]] as an independent candidate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tulospalvelu.vaalit.fi/KV-2017/fi/val091.html#6 |title=Valitut: Helsinki |publisher=Ministry of Justice |date=13 April 2017 |accessdate=17 July 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Väyrynen also participated the [[Finnish presidential election, 2018|2018 presidential election]] as an independent candidate, finishing fourth with 6.2 percent of the votes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://yle.fi/uutiset/3-10045725 |title=Väyrynen "äärimmäisen tyytyväinen" omaan tulokseensa – "Keväällä tulen ilahduttamaan Suomen kansaa sillä, että palaan eduskuntaan"|publisher=Yle|date=28 January 2018 |accessdate=28 January 2018 |language=Finnish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2018, Citizens' Party expelled Väyrynen from the party, due to his alleged misdeeds with the campaign funding during the presidential elections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hs.fi/politiikka/art-2000005589852.html|title=Kansalaispuolue ilmoittaa erottaneensa Paavo Väyrysen puolueesta|publisher=Helsingin Sanoamt|date=3 March 2018|accessdate = 20 June 2018|language = Finnish}}&lt;/ref&gt; Väyrynen denied the allegations and instead started a court case against the activities of the board of the party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mtv.fi/uutiset/kotimaa/artikkeli/itseluottamusta-uhkuva-vayrynen-jattaa-kansalaispuolueen-tahtaa-yha-sipilan-tilalle-olen-ollut-kaksi-kertaa-nostamassa-keskustaa-kuilun-partaalta/6863090#gs.Qol7cro|title=Itseluottamusta uhkuva Väyrynen jättää kansalaispuolueen, tähtää yhä Sipilän tilalle – "Olen ollut kaksi kertaa nostamassa keskustaa kuilun partaalta"|publisher=MTV3|date=12 April 2018|accessdate = 20 June 2018|language = Finnish}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the court case was still ongoing, Väyrynen founded a Citizens' Party's parliamentary group, with an intention to represent the party within the parliament.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.uusisuomi.fi/kotimaa/251655-paavo-vayrysen-tilanteesta-paanvaivaa-eduskunnassa-emme-voi-tassa-vaiheessa-oikein |title=Väyrysen tilanteesta päänvaivaa eduskunnassa: ”Emme voi tässä vaiheessa oikein evätäkään”|publisher=Uusi Suomi|date=19 June 2018 |accessdate=20 June 2018 |language=Finnish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4071">'''''Colombo Dreams''''' was a show performed by the [[University College London]] [[Sri Lanka]]n Society on Friday 28 January and Saturday 29 January 2005 at [[the Bloomsbury Theatre]], [[London]] and was directed by Pam Kangeyan, Thushan Dias, Marcus Ranney and Shaun Fernando.

Loosely based on the [[theatre]] production ''[[Bombay Dreams]]'', ''Colombo Dreams'' was a hit [[romantic comedy]] grossing almost £6,000 which went to charities in aid of the [[Indian Ocean Tsunami]] relief effort in [[Sri Lanka]]. Based around the play were several contemporary and traditional dances, as well as classical orchestra, performed by members of the UCL Sri Lankan Society.

== Plot ==

Pushpakumar Pitiyapolgodagoonetillekeratneupersirisekera is just an ordinary schoolboy growing up in the remote village of Bambalasuriyaville, [[Sri Lanka]]. Like all country boys his age, when he is not at school, and when he is not getting up to mischief with his best friend, and secret admirer, Samanthi, he is obliged to help his family out on their small subsistence farm. But Pushpa is like no ordinary boy - he rejects the calls for him to go to medical school and make a life for himself... instead, Pushpa believes his haphazard, almost comic, acting skills will find him fame and fortune in the thriving(!) Sri Lankan movie industry. His chance to show his talent and make it big finally comes along when a little-known Indian director, Asoka Choudary, comes to town to find talent for his latest production - ''Lagaanic'' - a [[period drama]]/[[romantic comedy]] depicting the class oppression of the Sri Lankan village-folk by their colonial masters, resulting in a game of [[cricket]] being played by the villagers against their oppressors - on a sinking ship in the [[Indian Ocean]].

In making the film, Pushpa becomes ensnared by the sexy allure of an Indian co-star, the famous D-grade actress Aishwarya, who exposes him to the self-obsessed and indulgent lifestyle of [[Bollywood]] stars. Samanthi, with the help of a wheeler-dealing dodgy acting Guru realises that if she wants to win Pushpa's heart, she must do the unthinkable... become a man! Leaving Pushpa in a predicament; does he follow his dreams and become just another D-grade Bollywood actor? Or is eternal love with his lifelong friend in the humbleness of village life the real dream that we secretly long for?

* The video sequence was destroyed on the night of the premiere of ''Colombo Dreams'', but thanks to the genius of Society Treasurer/Technical Director Ryan Dhunnookchand and script-writer Thushan Dias, the sequence was digitally remastered minutes before curtains up.
* The £6,000 raised was split between two charities; "UK Association for Medical Aid to Sri Lanka" and "Vithu Trust Fund Ltd."
* ''Colombo Dreams'' was originally to be called ''I'm A Sri Lankan, Get Me Out Of Here!''

'''Color realism''' is a [[fine art]] style where accurately portrayed colors create a sense of space and form. It employs a flattening of objects into areas of color, where the modulations occur more as a result of an object interacting with the color and light of its environment than the sculptural modeling of form or presentation of textural detail. The actual color of an object, or 'local color', is held secondary to how that color interacts with surrounding light sources that may alter the look of the original color. Warm light of the sun, cool light from the sky, and warm reflected light bouncing off other objects are all examples of how a local color may be affected by its location in space.

Earliest proponents of this style include the Dutch Master [[Johannes Vermeer]] and [[Hendrick Terbrugghen]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}
Recent artists working with this style include the [[Boston School (painting)|Boston School]] of painters, such as [[Edmund Tarbell]] and [[William McGregor Paxton]]. These artists combined vibrant Impressionist pastel colors with a more traditional palette, to create color-realist works that have a full range of dark to light values.&lt;ref&gt;''A Legacy of Beauty: Paintings in the Boston School Tradition'' by Christopher Volpe&lt;/ref&gt; Contemporary artists utilizing elements of this style include [[Sam Vokey]], [[Charles Tersolo]]{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}, and [[Barbara Glee Lucas]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8577">'''Come-outer''' is a phrase coined in the 1830s which denotes a person who withdraws from an established organization, or one who advocates political reform.&lt;ref&gt;Merriam-Webster Online. [http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/Come-outer ''Come-outer''] Retrieved on April 11, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The term was first applied during the [[Second Great Awakening]] to a small group of American [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionists]] who dissented from religious orthodoxy, who withdrew from a number of established churches because the churches were not progressive enough on the issue of abolition. A come-outer would not join a church which held a neutral position on the issue of slavery, and he would not vote, or run for office, or otherwise take part in a government that let slavery happen. The phrase was derived from the [[Bible]] verse, II Corinthians 6:17 which read "Wherefore '''come out''' from among them, and be ye separate, saith the Lord, and touch not the unclean thing; and I will receive you."&lt;ref&gt;Von Frank, Albert J. [https://books.google.com/books?id=Vj7f249hSwsC&amp;pg=PA338&amp;lpg=PA338 ''The trials of Anthony Burns,'' p. 338.] Retrieved on April 6, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Garrisonian anti-institutionalism===
[[William Lloyd Garrison]] was an influential [[Boston]] abolitionist who founded the [[New England Anti-Slavery Society]] and the [[American Anti-Slavery Society]] in the early 1830s. Garrison advocated an immediate end to slavery, rather than a step-by-step process working through the political system. In 1832, he printed an anti-slavery tract called ''Thoughts on African Colonization'' which included the "come out from among them" verse from the [[Second Epistle to the Corinthians]], and a quote from a recently deceased Reverend Doctor Thomson of [[Edinburgh]]: "To say that we will only come out of the sin by degrees—that we will only forsake it slowly, and step by step... is to trample on the demands of moral obligation..."&lt;ref&gt;Garrison, William Lloyd, [https://books.google.com/books?id=KcsNAAAAQAAJ ''Thoughts on African Colonization: or An Impartial Exhibition of the Doctrines, Principles and Purposes of the American Colonization Society, together with the Resolutions, Addresses and Remonstrances of the Free People of Color'']. Garrison and Knapf, 1832, pages 24 and 87.&lt;/ref&gt; At the New England Anti-Slavery Convention in 1836, Garrison proposed that only churches willing to help fight slavery should be considered "the true and real church of God."&lt;ref name=Putnam&gt;Putnam, Mary Burnham. [https://archive.org/stream/baptistsslavery102putn/baptistsslavery102putn_djvu.txt ''The Baptists and Slavery, 1840–1845'']. George Wahr, [[Ann Arbor, Michigan]], 1913. Retrieved on April 11, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; This was viewed by many as too divisive, so other means were tried until the 1837 convention when a resolution was adopted urging abolitionists to leave unresponsive churches, "to come out from among them and be separate."&lt;ref name=Putnam/&gt; Garrison's radical ideas defined a strong split within the anti-slavery societies, and Garrison was abandoned by all but a dedicated core group of like-minded abolitionists. The Boston-based group of reformers began to be called "come-outers".&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopædia Britannica. [http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/226208/William-Lloyd-Garrison ''William Lloyd Garrison'']. Retrieved on April 11, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Garrison's newspaper, ''[[The Liberator (newspaper)|The Liberator]]'', served to spread his view of abolition and anti-institutionalism. From time to time, news items about come-outers would appear, some culled from other journals. In 1851, Garrison quoted an article entitled "Come-outers in jail" which appeared in ''[[The Barnstable Patriot]]'': "Several of these poor deluded beings in [[Barnstable, Massachusetts|Barnstable]], whose actions we have before noticed, are now on trial in that town for an assault upon a constable when in the discharge of his duty…the poor creatures are insane, and can hardly be held responsible for their acts.  ….the most fitting place for these unfortunate beings is in the [[Psychiatric hospital|Insane Hospital]]."&lt;ref name=jail&gt;''The Liberator'', January 31, 1851. [http://www.theliberatorfiles.com/come-outers-in-jail/ ''Come-outers in jail'']. Retrieved on April 12, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Garrison offered his opinion that the 'poor deluded beings' were quite properly "laboring under religious insanity."&lt;ref name=jail/&gt;

Other regions of the [[United States]] that held pockets of "'''come-outerism'''" included [[Cape Cod]], [[New Hampshire]] and [[New York (state)|New York]].&lt;ref name=Perry/&gt;

===Abolition and church reform===
Come-outers themselves split further into those who, like Garrison, were against any institution at all, and those who believed that political systems and churches could be reformed into anti-slavery organizations. Non-Garrisonian come-outers split from [[Methodist]], [[Baptist]] and [[Presbyterian]] churches to form new church doctrines that were either completely free of slavery or focused on anti-slavery. The American Baptist Anti-Slavery Convention in 1840 brought the issue to the fore, defining a split among Baptists.&lt;ref name=Ferrell/&gt; The [[American Baptist Free Mission Society]] formed in 1843 in Boston when 17 Baptists led by [[William Henry Brisbane]] left their church to create a non-racist, anti-slavery evangelical group with missions to Haiti, Burma and Africa.&lt;ref&gt;Cathcart, William. [https://books.google.com/books?id=7-zWuEM-qHMC&amp;pg=PA415&amp;lpg=PA415 ''The Baptist Encyclopaedia''], Volume 1 of 3, 1881, p. 451.&lt;/ref&gt; [[James G. Birney]] and [[Gerrit Smith]] were among those who left the Presbyterian church.&lt;ref name=Ferrell&gt;Ferrell, Claudine L. [https://books.google.com/books?id=mG_MNzwawSAC&amp;pg=PA75&amp;lpg=PA75 ''The Abolitionist Movement''], Greenwood Press, 2006. pp. 75–77.&lt;/ref&gt; The integrated [[American Missionary Association]], a non-denominational group, formed in 1846 mostly of Presbyterian and Congregational members who were unable to get their churches to commit to fight slavery. The [[Wesleyan Methodist Connection]] was organized in 1843 and grew to some 15,000 members, many of whom were not Methodist.&lt;ref name=Ferrell/&gt; By 1850, membership in come-outer churches, combined with those in religious denominations such as [[Free Will Baptist]] who had long been against slavery, reached 241,000 in America.&lt;ref&gt;Jeffrey, Julie Roy.

===Tax resistance===
Some come-outers engaged in [[tax resistance]] because of their unwillingness to fund a government that did not work to end slavery. [[Henry David Thoreau]] and [[Amos Bronson Alcott]] both used tax resistance in this way. Utopian [[Brook Farm]] has been described as "a come-outer enterprise".&lt;ref&gt;Abel, Darrel.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2529">'''Correlative''' ("corelative," UK spelling) is the term adopted by [[Wesley Newcomb Hohfeld]] to describe the philosophical relationships between fundamental legal concepts in [[jurisprudence]].

== Hohfeldian analysis ==

Hohfeld was concerned that there was some ambiguity in the explanation of the similarities and differences between concepts in law. Hence, with the focus on the nature of ''rights'', he proposed a system of analysis based on "jural correlatives" and "jural opposites". A correlative is where two concepts are [[logically consistent]] and the one necessarily implies the other. When two concepts are Hohfeldian opposites (technically, logical contradictions), they are mutually exclusive.

Thus, if A has a right with regard to B, an analysis of their relationship from B's point of view must imply that B has a duty to A. An owner of land may hold four distinct entitlements: rights, privileges, powers, and immunities. Hohfeld linked each entitlement to a corelative and its opposite:

{| style="width:250px; height:200px" border="1"
|- 
| '''Elements'''
| '''Correlatives'''
| '''Opposites'''
|- style="height:100px" 
| Right
| style="width:250px" |Duty
| No Right
|-
| Privilege or Liberty
| No Right
| Duty
|- style="height:100px" 
| Power
| style="width:250px" |Liability
| Disability
|- style="height:100px" 
| Immunity
| style="width:250px" |Disability
| Liability
|-
|-
|}

==In practice==
Jurists such as [[Mickey Dias]] and [[Wesley Newcomb Hohfeld#Hohfeldian analysis|Hohfeld]] have declared that rights and duties are ''jural corelatives'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Dias |title=Jurisprudence |year=1976 |first=Reginald Walter Michael |oclc=2668655 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which means that if someone has a right, ''someone else'' owes a duty to him. This reasoning of Dias' was used in ''[[Murphy v Brentwood DC|Murphy v Brentwood District Council]]'' (1991) to disapprove  [[Alfred Denning|Lord Denning]] [[Master of the Rolls|MR]]'s judgment in ''[[Dutton v Bognor Regis UDC|Dutton v Bognor Regis Urban District Council]]'' (1972).&lt;ref&gt;Denning had argued, wrongly, that when a local council has a right to inspect a building under construction, the council has a corresponding duty of care to "inspect properly".&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Dorothy Whitelock''', {{Post-nominals|country=GBR|FSA|FRHistS|FBA|size=100%|sep=,}} (11 November 1901 &amp;ndash; 14 August 1982) was an English historian. From 1957 to 1969, she was the [[Elrington and Bosworth Professor of Anglo-Saxon]] at the [[University of Cambridge]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oenewsletter.org/OEN/print.php/memorials/whitelock/subsidia.php|title=In Memoriam: Dorothy Whitelock (1901-82)|last=|first=|date=|website=Old English Newsletter|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her best-known work is ''[[English Historical Documents]], vol. I: c. 500-1042'', which she edited.  It is a compilation of translated sources, with introductions.

Her other works include ''The Beginnings of English Society'' (1952), ''After Bede'' (1960), ''The Audience of Beowulf'' (1951), and ''Genuine Asser'' (1967), in which she argued against [[Vivian Hunter Galbraith|V.H. Galbraith]]'s assertion that [[Asser]]'s ''Life of King Alfred'' was a forgery by [[Leofric (bishop)|Leofric]].

==Early life==

Whitelock was born in Leeds to Edward Whitelock and his second wife Emmeline Dawson. Edward died in 1903 but despite financial struggles, Dorothy Whitelock was able to attend the [[Leeds Girls' High School]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Whitelock was a promising student at school and it came as no surprise when in 1921 she went up to [[Newnham College, Cambridge]] at the age of 20, where she studied for Section B of the English Tripos under [[Hector Munro Chadwick]]. She gained a First in Part I and a Second in Part II.

== Academic Career ==
Whitelock went on to postgraduate work, as Marion Kennedy Student at Newnham (1924–26), Cambridge University Scandinavian Student at Uppsala (1927–29), and the first woman to receive the Allen Scholarship at Cambridge (1929–30)&lt;ref&gt;Jana K. Schulman, 'An Anglo-Saxonist at Oxford and Cambridge: Dorothy Whitelock (1901-1982)', in ''Women Medievalists and the Academy'', ed. by Jane Chance (Madison, Wis.: University of Wisconsin Press, 2005), pp. 553-62 (at p. 553).&lt;/ref&gt; These labours led to her first book, her 1930 translation and commentary on thirty nine Anglo-Saxon wills.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.waterstones.com/waterstonesweb/products/dorothy+whitelock/anglo-saxon+wills/8548003/ Waterstone's catalogue]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Anglo-Saxon Wills|last=Whitelock|first=Dorothy|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1930|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year, she became a lecturer in English language at St Hilda's College, Oxford (tutor in 1935, full fellow 1937, vice principal 1951). In 1940, she was elected a Leverhulme Fellow and in 1946 became a University Lecturer in Old English at Oxford.&lt;ref&gt;Jana K. Schulman, 'An Anglo-Saxonist at Oxford and Cambridge: Dorothy Whitelock (1901-1982)', in ''Women Medievalists and the Academy'', ed. by Jane Chance (Madison, Wis.: University of Wisconsin Press, 2005), pp. 553-62 (at pp. 554-55).&lt;/ref&gt; In 1957, she returned to Cambridge, and Newnham, as the [[Elrington and Bosworth Professor of Anglo-Saxon]].&lt;ref&gt;Jana K. Schulman, 'An Anglo-Saxonist at Oxford and Cambridge: Dorothy Whitelock (1901-1982)', in ''Women Medievalists and the Academy'', ed. by Jane Chance (Madison, Wis.: University of Wisconsin Press, 2005), pp. 553-62 (at p. 556).&lt;/ref&gt;

Notwithstanding these successes, throughout her career, Whitelock found herself frustrated by a male-dominated academy which often favoured male scholars at the expense of talented female academics. In 1945, following her failure to secure a professorship at the University of Liverpool, Whitelock applied for the [[Rawlinson and Bosworth Professor of Anglo-Saxon|Rawlinson and Bosworth professorship of Anglo-Saxon]] at the [[University of Oxford]], a chair that had been vacated by [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]. She was unsuccessful; Tolkien himself had voted against her. In the face of such opposition she was tempted to abandon the academy altogether but her close friends, the leading Anglo-Saxon historians [[Sir Frank Stenton]] and his wife [[Doris Mary Stenton|Doris]], addressed a series of supportive letters to her, encouraging her to persevere. A key part of her work was lobbying for Oxford's women's colleges to have the same status as men's, finally achieved only in 1959.&lt;ref&gt;Jana K.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9953">The '''dynastic race theory''' was the earliest thesis to attempt to explain how predynastic Egypt developed into the sophisticated monarchy of [[Dynastic Egypt]]. The theory holds that the earliest roots of the [[ancient Egypt]]ian dynastic civilisation were imported by invaders from [[Mesopotamia]] who then founded the [[First Dynasty of Egypt|First Dynasty]] and brought culture to the indigenous population. This theory had strong supporters in the Egyptological community in the first half of the 20th century, but has since lost mainstream support.

==Origins==
In the early 20th century, Egyptologist Sir [[William Matthew Flinders Petrie]] deduced that skeletal remains found at pre-dynastic sites at [[Naqada]] (Upper Egypt) indicated the presence of two different races, with the Dynastic Race, also referred to as the "Followers of Horus",&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Emery, W.B. Archaic Egypt, Penguin Books, 1987 0-14-020462-8&lt;/ref&gt; differentiated physically by a noticeably larger skeletal structure and cranial capacity.&lt;ref&gt;Derry, D.E., The Dynastic Race in Egypt, Journal of Egyptian Archeology, vol 42, 1956&lt;/ref&gt; Petrie concluded that the physical differences of the remains in conjunction with the previously unknown burial styles, uncharacteristic tomb architecture, and abundance of foreign artifacts, implied this race must have been an invading ruling elite that was responsible for the seemingly sudden rise of Egyptian civilization. Based on plentiful cultural evidence, Petrie determined that the invader race had come from Mesopotamia, and imposed themselves on the native [[Badarian culture]] to become their rulers. Petrie adduced new architectural styles—the distinctly Mesopotamian "niched-facade" architecture—pottery styles, cylinder seals and a few artworks, as well as numerous Predynastic rock and tomb paintings depicting Mesopotamian style boats, symbols, and figures.

This came to be called the "dynastic race theory"&lt;ref&gt;Mary R. Lefkowitz, Guy MacLean Rogers, [https://books.google.com/books?id=97jwg1Xwpj0C&amp;pg=PA65 Black Athena Revisited, pg65]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Egypt pg 15"&gt;Early dynastic Egypt, by Toby A. H. Wilkinson, pg 15&lt;/ref&gt; The theory further argued that the Mesopotamians then conquered both Upper and Lower Egypt and founded the [[First dynasty of Egypt|First Dynasty]]. Predynastic and First Dynasty burial sites similar to Naqada were also found at Abydos, Sakkara, and Hieraconpolis.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Versions of the Dynastic race model were adopted by scholars as [[L. A. Waddell]],&lt;ref&gt;Egyptian Civilization Its Sumerian Origin and Real Chronology, by L. A. Waddell&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Walter Bryan Emery]], a former Chair of Egyptology at University College London.

==Decline==
The dynastic race theory is no longer an accepted thesis in the field of predynastic archaeology. While there is clear evidence the Naqada II culture borrowed abundantly from Mesopotamia, the most commonly held view today is that the achievements of the First Dynasty were the result of a long period of cultural and political development.&lt;ref&gt;Early Dynastic Egypt (Routledge, 1999), p.15&lt;/ref&gt; Such borrowings are much older than the Naqada II period,&lt;ref&gt;Redford, Donald B., ''Egypt, Israel, and Canaan in Ancient Times'' (Princeton: University Press, 1992), p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; the Naqada II period had a large degree of continuity with the Naqada I period,&lt;ref&gt;Gardiner, Alan. ''Egypt of the Pharaohs'' (Oxford: University Press, 1961), p. 392.&lt;/ref&gt; and the changes which did happen during the Naqada periods happened over significant amounts of time.&lt;ref&gt;Shaw, Ian. and Nicholson, Paul, ''The Dictionary of Ancient Egypt'' (London: British Museum Press, 1995), p. 228.&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern Egyptology largely maintains the view that "state formation occurred as a mainly indigenous process", although significant differences in morphology indicated migration along the Nile Valley also took place.&lt;ref&gt;Sonia R. Zakrzewski: [http://eprints.soton.ac.uk/12075/1/2007_PopnContinuityChange_AJPA_132pp501-9.pdf Population continuity or population change: Formation of the ancient Egyptian state] - Department of Archaeology, University of Southampton, Highfield, Southampton (2003)&lt;/ref&gt; The Dynastic Race theory has been largely replaced by the theory Egypt was a [[hydraulic empire]].

==In Afrocentrism==
In the 1950s, when the Dynastic Race Theory was widely accepted by mainstream scholarship, the Senegalese Egyptologist [[Cheikh Anta Diop]] was publicising his theory that the Ancient Egyptians were "Black Africans". Diop "paid special attention to the emergence of the Dynastic Race Theory", and claimed that European scholars supported this theory to avoid having to admit that the Ancient Egyptians were black and to charactise them as "Semitic" or "Caucasian".&lt;ref&gt;Epic encounters: culture, media, and U.S. interests in the Middle East – 1945-2000 by Melani McAlister&lt;/ref&gt; Other prominent Afrocentrists, including [[Martin Bernal]], later also argued against the dynastic race theory in favour of a "Black Egyptian" model.&lt;ref&gt;Heresy in the University: the Black Athena controversy and the Responsibilities of American Intellectuals. By Jacques Berlinerblau, pg 158&lt;/ref&gt; The most recent contributor to an Afrocentric model of the Ancient Egyptians is by Segun Magbagbeola,&lt;ref name=Magbagbeola&gt;{{cite book|last=Magbagbeola|first=Segun|title=Black Egyptians: The African Origins of Ancient Egypt|year=2012|publisher=Akasha Publishing Ltd|location=United Kingdom|isbn=978-09573695-0-4|pages=12–14|url=https://www.google.com/search?tbo=p&amp;tbm=bks&amp;q=isbn:0957369506}}&lt;/ref&gt; who included information from Nuwaupu in his book ''Black Egyptians''.&lt;ref name=Magbagbeola /&gt; Afrocentrists particularly condemn the alleged dividing of African peoples into racial clusters as being new versions of the Dynastic Race Theory and the [[Hamitic hypothesis]].&lt;ref&gt;History of Philosophy (3 Vols. Set), by William Turner , pg 8&lt;/ref&gt;

==Revival==
A version of the theory has been revived by some modern scholars, most notably [[David Rohl]],&lt;ref&gt;Legend – The Genesis of Civilisation, by David Rohl ::: http://www.davidrohl.com/dynastic_race_11.html&lt;/ref&gt; and Michael Rice,&lt;ref&gt;Egypt's making: the origins of ancient Egypt, 5000-2000 BC, by Michael Rice&lt;/ref&gt; who have advanced reasons in support of a Mesopotamian origin of Dynastic Egypt in books such as Rohl's ''Legend-The Genesis of Civilisation'' and Rice's ''Egypt's Making''.

According to Rohl, "There is little evidence of kingship and its rituals very much before the beginning of the 1st Dynasty; no signs of the gradual development of metal working, art, monumental architecture and writing—the defining criteria of early civilisation. Much of what we know about the pharaohs and their complex culture seems to come into existence in a flash of inspiration."&lt;ref&gt;Rohl, David M., Legend the Genesis of Civilisation (Arrow Books Limited, 1998), p. 253&lt;/ref&gt; Rohl believes the catalyst for this sudden development was the influx of a Mesopotamian "foreign elite" who made their way to Egypt by sailing around the coastline of the Arabian Peninsula into the Red Sea ultimately dragging their boats across the desert to the Nile. Rohl notes numerous pre-dynastic rock carvings found in several locations from Wadi Abbad to Abydos which is suggested depict large Mesopotamian style boats with crews of up to 75, some of which appear being pulled across land.&lt;ref&gt;Rohl, David M., Legend the Genesis of Civilisation (Arrow Books Limited, 1998), p. 253-302&lt;/ref&gt; Rohl believes the most dramatic evidence to support this theory is the sudden introduction of distinctly Mesopotamian "niched-facade", also known as "palace facade", architecture found in several early Dynastic sites, most notably the large 1st Dynasty mastabas at Saqqara. A depiction of a building using this kind of architecture is also an integral part of the serekh, the early Egyptian seal of kingship, and is found before the 1st Dynasty as well in the Naqada III, or "Dynasty 0" period. He says, "It is highly improbable that such specialized building techniques were independently invented in two widely separated regions at the same historical period without cultural transmission.&lt;ref&gt;Rohl, David M., Legend the Genesis of Civilisation (Arrow Books Limited, 1998), p. 332&lt;/ref&gt; 
        
In addition to the evidence available to Petrie et al., proponents also point out similarities in the names of divinities and places in the religious beliefs of the two cultures, and in depictions of regalia. For example the primeval mound of the Egyptian first creation was called the Island of Nun, and was surrounded by the Waters of Nun, while the Sumerian name for the great temple in their original city of Eridu was Nun.ki—the 'Mighty Place'—and it was built on an island in the reed swamps. Several scholars have also noted that the name Osiris is a Greek pronunciation, and that the god would have been called Asar in Egyptian, while the Sumerian god of the Eridu area was also called Asar (the Babylonian [[Marduk]].).&lt;ref&gt;Dictionary of Ancient Deities, by Patricia Turner, Charles Russell Coulter&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Sumer#Uruk period|Uruk period]] of Ancient Mesopotamia (4100–2900 BC calibrated) predates the [[Naqada II]] period of Ancient Egypt (3500-3200 BC) and indeed there is evidence of colonies of this Uruk civilization over a wide area—from the [[Taurus Mountains]] in [[Turkey]], to the [[Mediterranean Sea]] in the west, and as far east as Central [[Iran]].&lt;ref name="Algaze, Guillermo 2005"&gt;Algaze, Guillermo (2005) "The Uruk World System: The Dynamics of Expansion of Early Mesopotamian Civilization", (Second Edition, University of Chicago Press)&lt;/ref&gt;

{{DISPLAYTITLE:''immediations''}}
'''''immediations''''' is an annual [[Peer review|peer-reviewed]] [[academic journal]] in the [[history of art]], published by the [[Courtauld Institute of Art]], London.  The journal was established in 2004 by Louise Sørensen, John-Paul Stonard, and Linda Goddard.

''immediations'' covers research on any period in the history of art by current or recent members of the postgraduate community of the Courtauld Institute of Art. ''immediations'' also publishes interviews with art historians, artists, conservators and curators, and transcripts of events held at The Courtauld Institute of Art Research Forum.

In 2009, ''immediations'' initiated an occasional series of period-specific, themed volumes with ''immediations Conference Papers 1: Art and Nature, Studies in Medieval Art and Architecture'' ({{ISBN|978-1907485008}}), edited by Laura Cleaver, Kathryn Gerry, and Jim Harris.

2014 marked the journal's tenth year, celebrated by a series of events including a Conference on 17 January 2015 at the Courtauld Institute of Art. The conference featured past contributors and editors, who discussed their current research or the ways in which the trajectory of their careers in the art world reflected their original contributions to ''immediations''.

[[File:Punch Rhodes Colossus.png|thumb|[[Cecil Rhodes]] and the [[Cape-Cairo railway]] project. Rhodes founded the [[De Beers Mining Company]], owned the [[British South Africa Company]] and had his name given to what became the state of [[Rhodesia]]. He liked to "paint the map [[British Empire|British]] red" and declared: "all of these stars&amp;nbsp;... these vast worlds that remain out of reach. If I could, I would annex other planets".&lt;ref&gt;[[S. Gertrude Millin]], ''Rhodes'', London: 1933, p. 138.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

'''Imperialism''' is a state policy, practice, or advocacy of extending power and dominion, especially by direct territorial acquisition or by gaining political and economic control of other areas. Because it always involves the use of power, whether military force or some subtler form, imperialism has often been considered morally reprehensible, and the term is frequently employed in international propaganda to denounce and discredit an opponent’s foreign policy.

It is different from [[new imperialism]], as the term ''imperialism'' is usually applied to the colonization of the Americas between the 15th and 19th centuries, as opposed to the expansion of [[Western world|Western Powers]] and [[Japan]] during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. However, both are examples of imperialism.

== Etymology and usage ==
The word imperialism originated from the Latin word ''[[imperium]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0060%3Aentry%3Dimperium|title=Charlton T. Lewis, An Elementary Latin Dictionary, imperium (inp-)|access-date=11 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; which means supreme power. It first became common with its current sense in [[Great Britain]], during the 1870s and was used with a negative connotation.&lt;ref name="Magnusson"&gt;{{cite book|title=Teorier om imperialism|last=Magnusson|first=Lars|year=1991|isbn=978-91-550-3830-4|location=Södertälje|page=19|language=Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt; Previously the word imperialism had been used to describe to what was perceived as [[Napoleon III]]'s attempts of obtaining political support through foreign military interventions.&lt;ref name="Magnusson"/&gt; The term was and is mainly applied to Western (and Japanese) political and economic dominance, especially in Asia and Africa, in the 19th and 20th centuries. Its precise meaning continues to be debated by scholars. Some writers, such as [[Edward Said]], use the term more broadly to describe any system of domination and subordination organised with an imperial center and a periphery.&lt;ref name="Edward Said 1994. P. 9"&gt;Edward W. Said. Culture and Imperialism. Vintage Publishers, 1994. p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; This definition encompasses both nominal [[empire]]s and [[neocolonialism]].

==Colonialism vs. imperialism==
[[File:World 1898 empires colonies territory.png|thumb|right|upright=1.6|Imperial powers in 1898]]
"The word 'empire' comes from the Latin word imperium; for which the closest modern English equivalent would perhaps be '[[sovereignty]]', or simply 'rule'".&lt;ref&gt;Howe, 13&lt;/ref&gt; The greatest distinction of an empire is through the amount of land that a nation has conquered and expanded. Political power grows from conquering land; however, cultural and economic aspects flourish through sea and trade routes.  A distinction about empires is "that although political empires were built mostly by expansion overland, economic and cultural influences spread at least as much by sea".&lt;ref&gt;Howe, 45&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the main aspects of trade that went overseas consisted of animals and plant products. European empires in Asia and Africa "have come to be seen as the classic forms of imperialism: and indeed most books on the subject confine themselves to the European seaborne empires".&lt;ref&gt;Howe, 62&lt;/ref&gt; European expansion caused the world to be divided by how developed and developing nation are portrayed through the [[world systems theory]]. The two main regions are the core and the periphery. The core consists of high areas of income and profit; the periphery is on the opposing side of the spectrum consisting of areas of low income and profit. These critical theories of [[Geopolitics|Geo-politics]] have led to increased discussion of the meaning and impact of imperialism on the modern post-colonial world. The Russian leader Lenin suggested that "imperialism was the highest form of capitalism, claiming that imperialism developed after colonialism, and was distinguished from colonialism by monopoly capitalism".&lt;ref&gt;Gilmartin, 116&lt;/ref&gt; This idea from Lenin stresses how important new political world order has become in our modern era. Geopolitics now focuses on states becoming major economic players in the market; some states today are viewed as empires due to their political and economic authority over other nations.

The term "imperialism" is often conflated with "[[colonialism]]"; however, many scholars have argued that each have their own distinct definition. Imperialism and colonialism have been used in order to describe one's perceived superiority, domination and influence upon a person or group of people. [[Robert J. C. Young|Robert Young]] writes that while imperialism operates from the center, is a state policy and is developed for ideological as well as financial reasons, colonialism is simply the development for settlement or commercial intentions. However, colonialism still includes invasion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/907133189|title=Empire, colony, postcolony|last=Young|first=Robert,|year=2015|isbn=9781405193559|pages=54|oclc=907133189}}&lt;/ref&gt; Colonialism in modern usage also tends to imply a degree of geographic separation between the colony and the imperial power. Particularly, Edward Said distinguishes the difference between imperialism and colonialism by stating; "imperialism involved 'the practice, the theory and the attitudes of a dominating metropolitan center ruling a distant territory', while colonialism refers to the 'implanting of settlements on a distant territory.'&lt;ref&gt;Gilmartin, Mary "Colonialism/Imperialism"&lt;/ref&gt; Contiguous land empires such as the Russian or Ottoman have traditionally been excluded from discussions of colonialism, though this is beginning to change, since it is accepted that they also sent populations into the territories they ruled.&lt;ref name=Gallaher&gt;{{cite book |last1=Gallaher |first1=Carolyn |author-link1=Carolyn Gallaher |last2=Dahlman |first2=Carl T. |last3=Gilmartin |first3=Mary |last4=Mountz |first4=Alison |last5=Shirlow |first5=Peter |date=2009 |title=Key Concepts in Political Geography |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XpBJclVnVdQC&amp;pg=PA116 |publisher=SAGE |location=London |page=392 |isbn=978-1-4129-4672-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|116}} Thus it can be said that imperialism includes some form of colonialism, but colonialism itself does not automatically imply imperialism, as it lacks a political focus.{{elucidate|date=April 2013}}

Imperialism and colonialism both dictate the political and economic advantage over a land and the indigenous populations they control, yet scholars sometimes find it difficult to illustrate the difference between the two.&lt;ref name="Painter &amp; Jeffrey"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Painter |first1=Joe |last2=Jeffrey |first2=Alex |title=Political Geography |date=2009 |edition=2nd |publisher=SAGE |isbn=978-1-44-624435-7 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|107}} Although imperialism and colonialism focus on the suppression of ''an other'', if colonialism refers to the process of a country taking physical control of another, imperialism refers to the political and monetary dominance, either formally or informally. Colonialism is seen to be the architect deciding how to start dominating areas and then imperialism can be seen as creating the idea behind conquest cooperating with colonialism. Colonialism is when the imperial nation begins a conquest over an area and then eventually is able to rule over the areas the previous nation had controlled. Colonialism's core meaning is the exploitation of the valuable assets and supplies of the nation that was conquered and the conquering nation then gaining the benefits from the spoils of the war.&lt;ref name="Painter &amp; Jeffrey"/&gt;{{rp|170–75}} The meaning of imperialism is to create an empire, by conquering the other state's lands and therefore increasing its own dominance. Colonialism is the builder and preserver of the colonial possessions in an area by a population coming from a foreign region.&lt;ref name="Painter &amp; Jeffrey"/&gt;{{rp|173–76}} Colonialism can completely change the existing social structure, physical structure and economics of an area; it is not unusual that the characteristics of the conquering peoples are inherited by the conquered indigenous populations.&lt;ref name="Painter &amp; Jeffrey"/&gt;{{rp|41}} Few colonies remain remote from their mother country. Thus, most will eventually establish a separate nationality or remain under complete control of their mother colony.&lt;ref&gt;http://oll.libertyfund.org/titles/hobson-imperialism-a-study&lt;/ref&gt;

A controversial aspect of imperialism is the defense and justification of empire-building based on seemingly rational grounds. In [[ancient China]], [[tianxia]] denoted the lands, space, and area divinely appointed to the [[Emperor]] by universal and well-defined principles of order. The center of this land was directly apportioned to the Imperial court, forming the center of a world view that centered on the Imperial court and went concentrically outward to major and minor officials and then the common citizens, [[tributary states]], and finally ending with the fringe "[[barbarians]]". Tianxia's idea of hierarchy gave [[Chinese people|Chinese]] a privileged position and was justified through the promise of order and peace. [[J. A. Hobson]] identifies this justification on general grounds as: "It is desirable that the earth should be peopled, governed, and developed, as far as possible, by the races which can do this work best, i.e. by the races of highest 'social efficiency'".&lt;ref&gt;Hobson, J. A. "Imperialism: a study." Cosimo, Inc., 2005. p. 154&lt;/ref&gt;  Many others argued that imperialism is justified for several different reasons. [[Friedrich Ratzel]] believed that in order for a state to survive, imperialism was needed. [[Halford Mackinder]] felt that [[Great Britain]] needed to be one of the greatest imperialists and therefore justified imperialism.&lt;ref&gt;Gilmartin, Mary. "Colonialism/Imperialism." Key Concepts in Political Geography. London: SAGE Publications Ltd., 2009. 115–24. SAGE knowledge. Web. Key Concepts in Human Geography. 24 Jan. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; The purportedly scientific nature of "[[Social Darwinism]]" and a theory of races formed a supposedly rational justification for imperialism. Under this doctrine, the French politician Jules Ferry could declare in 1883 that "Superior races have a right, because they have a duty. They have the duty to civilize the inferior races."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Modern Imperialism|publisher=D.C. Heath|year=1969|editor-last=Austen|editor-first=Ralph|location=Lexington, Massachusetts|pages=70–73}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rhetoric of colonizers being racially superior appears to have achieved its purpose, for example throughout Latin America "whiteness" is still prized today and various forms of [[blanqueamiento]] (whitening) are common.

The [[Royal Geographical Society|Royal Geographical Society of London]] and other geographical societies in Europe had great influence and were able to fund travelers who would come back with tales of their discoveries.&lt;ref name="Gilmartin 2009"/&gt; These societies also served as a space for travellers to share these stories.&lt;ref name="Gilmartin 2009"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Colonialism/Imperialism|last = Gilmartin|first = Mary|date = 2009|journal = Key Concepts in Political Geography |page=117}}&lt;/ref&gt; Political geographers such as Friedrich Ratzel of Germany and Halford Mackinder of Britain also supported imperialism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Colonialism/Imperialism|last = Gilmatin|first = Mary|date = 2009|journal = Key Concepts in Political Geography |page=117}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ratzel believed expansion was necessary for a state's survival while Mackinder supported Britain's imperial expansion; these two arguments dominated the discipline for decades.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Colonialism/Imperialism|last = Gilmarin|first = Mary|date = 2009|journal = Key Concepts in Political Geography}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Geographical theories such as [[environmental determinism]] also suggested that tropical environments created uncivilized people in need of European guidance.&lt;ref name="Gilmartin 2009"/&gt; For instance, American geographer [[Ellen Churchill Semple]] argued that even though human beings originated in the [[tropics]] they were only able to become fully human in the [[Temperate climate|temperate]] zone.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = "Illusory Riches": Representations of the Tropical World, 1850–1940|last = Arnold|first = David|date = 2000|journal = Singapore Journal of Tropical Geography|page= 11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tropicality can be paralleled with Edward Said's [[Orientalism]] as the west's construction of the east as the "other".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Illusory Riches: Representations of the Tropical World, 1850–1940|last = Arnold|first = David|date = 2000|journal = Singapore Journal of Tropical Geography |page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Said, orientalism allowed Europe to establish itself as the superior and the norm, which justified its dominance over the essentialized Orient.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The Other|last = Mountz|first = Alison|date = 2009|journal = Key Concepts in Political Geography |page=329}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Technology]] and [[economic efficiency]] were often improved in territories subjected to imperialism through the building of roads, other infrastructure and introduction of new technologies.

The principles of imperialism are often generalizable to the policies and practices of the [[British Empire]] "during the last generation, and proceeds rather by diagnosis than by historical description".&lt;ref&gt;Hobson, J. A. "Imperialism: a study." Cosimo, Inc., 2005. p. v.&lt;/ref&gt; British imperialism in some sparsely-inhabited regions appears to have applied a principle now termed [[Terra nullius]] (Latin expression which stems from [[Roman law]] meaning 'empty land'). The country of [[Australia]] serves as a case study in relation to British settlement and colonial rule of the continent in the eighteenth century, that was arguably premised on ''terra nullius'', as its settlers considered it unused by its original inhabitants.

===Orientalism and imaginative geography===
Imperial control, territorial and [[Cultural imperialism|cultural]], is justified through [[discourse]]s about the imperialists' understanding of different spaces.&lt;ref name="Hubbard, P. 2010 p. 239"&gt;Hubbard, P., &amp; Kitchin, R. Eds. ''Key Thinkers on Space and Place'', 2nd. Ed. Los Angeles, Calif:Sage Publications. 2010. p. 239.&lt;/ref&gt; Conceptually, [[imagined geographies]] explain the limitations of the imperialist understanding of the societies (human reality) of the different spaces inhabited by the non–European Other.&lt;ref name="Hubbard, P. 2010 p. 239"/&gt;

In ''[[Orientalism (book)|Orientalism]]'' (1978), [[Edward Said]] said that the West developed the concept of [[The Orient]]—an imagined geography of the [[Eastern world]]—which functions as an [[Essentialism|essentializing]] discourse that represents neither the ethnic diversity nor the social reality of the Eastern world.&lt;ref&gt;Sharp, J. (2008). Geographies of Postcolonialism. Los Angeles:London:Sage Publications. pp. 16, 17.&lt;/ref&gt; That by reducing the East into cultural essences, the imperial discourse uses place-based identities to create [[Difference (philosophy)|cultural difference]] and psychologic distance between "We, the West" and "They, the East" and between "Here, in the West" and "There, in the East".&lt;ref name="Said, Edward 1979 p.357"&gt;Said, Edward. "Imaginative Geography and its Representations: Orientalizing the Oriental", ''Orientalism''. New York:Vintage. p. 357.&lt;/ref&gt;

That cultural differentiation was especially noticeable in the books and paintings of early [[Oriental studies]], the European examinations of the Orient, which misrepresented the East as irrational and backward, the opposite of the rational and progressive West.&lt;ref name="Hubbard, P. 2010 p. 239"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sharp, J. ''Geographies of Postcolonialism''. Los Angeles: London: Sage Publications. 2008. p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; Defining the East as a negative vision of the Western world, as its inferior, not only increased the sense-of-self of the West, but also was a way of ordering the East, and making it known to the West, so that it could be dominated and controlled.&lt;ref&gt;Sharp, J. (2008). Geographies of Postcolonialism. Los Angeles:London: Sage Publications. p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Said, Edward.(1979) "Imaginative Geography and its Representations: Orientalizing the Oriental", ''Orientalism''. New York: Vintage. p. 361&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, Orientalism was the ideological justification of early Western imperialism—a body of knowledge and ideas that rationalized social, cultural, political, and economic control of other, non-white peoples.&lt;ref name="Said, Edward 1979 p.357"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gallaher, C., Dahlman, Carl T, Gilmartin, Mary, Mountz. (2009) ''Key Concepts in Political Geography'' (''Key Concepts in Human Geography''). SAGE Publications Ltd. p. 116.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cartography===
{{See also|Cartographic propaganda}}
One of the main tools used by imperialists was cartography. [[Cartography]] is "the art, science and technology of making maps"&lt;ref name="Harley, J.B. 1989"&gt;Harley, J.B. "Deconstructing the Map." Cartographica. 26.2 (1989): 1–20. Web. p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; but this definition is problematic. It implies that maps are objective representations of the world when in reality they serve very political means.&lt;ref name="Harley, J.B. 1989"/&gt; For Harley, maps serve as an example of [[Michel Foucault|Foucault's]] [[Power (social and political)|power]] and [[knowledge]] concept.

To better illustrate this idea, Bassett focuses his analysis of the role of nineteenth-century maps during the "[[scramble for Africa]]".&lt;ref name="Bassett, Thomas J. 1994"&gt;Bassett, Thomas J. "Cartography and Empire Building in Nineteenth-Century West Africa." Geographical Review. 84.3 (1994): 316–35. Web. p. 316&lt;/ref&gt; He states that maps "contributed to empire by promoting, assisting, and legitimizing the extension of French and British power into West Africa".&lt;ref name="Bassett, Thomas J. 1994"/&gt; During his analysis of nineteenth-century cartographic techniques, he highlights the use of blank space to denote unknown or unexplored territory.&lt;ref name="Bassett, Thomas J. 1994"/&gt; This provided incentives for imperial and colonial powers to obtain "information to fill in blank spaces on contemporary maps".&lt;ref name="Bassett, Thomas J. 1994"/&gt;

Although cartographic processes advanced through imperialism, further analysis of their progress reveals many biases linked to [[eurocentrism]]. According to Bassett, "[n]ineteenth-century explorers commonly requested Africans to sketch maps of unknown areas on the ground. Many of those maps were highly regarded for their accuracy"&lt;ref name="Bassett, Thomas J. 1994"/&gt; but were not printed in Europe unless Europeans verified them.

Imperialism in ancient times is clear in the history of China and in the history of western Asia and the Mediterranean—an unending succession of empires. The tyrannical empire of the Assyrians was replaced (6th–4th century BCE) by that of the Persians, in strong contrast to the Assyrian in its liberal treatment of subjected peoples, assuring it long duration. It eventually gave way to the imperialism of Greece. When Greek imperialism reached an apex under Alexander the Great(356–323 BCE), a union of the eastern Mediterranean with western Asia was achieved. But the cosmopolis, in which all citizens of the world would live harmoniously together in equality, remained a dream of Alexander. It was partially realized when the Romans built their empire from Britain to Egypt.

[[Cultural imperialism]] is an extremely fuzzy concept, pointing to the supposed influence of one dominant culture over others, i.e. a form of [[soft power]], which changes the moral, cultural, and societal [[worldview]] of the subordinate country. In some ways, this is such an expansion of the concept of imperialism as to be meaningless. This is more than just "foreign" music, television or film becoming popular with young people, but that popular culture changing their own expectations of life and their desire for their own country to become more like the foreign country depicted. For example, depictions of opulent American lifestyles in the soap opera [[Dallas (1978 TV series)#Dallas and the Cold War|Dallas during the Cold War]] changed the expectations of Romanians; a more recent example is the influence of smuggled [[South Korea]]n drama series in [[North Korea]]. The importance of soft power is not lost on authoritarian regimes, fighting such influence with bans on foreign popular culture, control of the internet and unauthorised satellite dishes etc. Nor is such a usage of culture recent, as part of Roman imperialism local elites would be exposed to the benefits and luxuries of Roman culture and lifestyle, with the aim that they would then become willing participants.

Imperialism has been subject to moral or immoral censure by its critics{{which|date=December 2014}}, and thus the term is frequently used in international propaganda as a pejorative for expansionist and aggressive foreign policy.&lt;ref name="IESS"&gt;"Imperialism."

===Age of Imperialism===
{{Main|International relations, 1648–1814|International relations of the Great Powers (1814–1919)}}
The Age of Imperialism, a time period beginning around 1760, saw European industrializing nations, engaging in the process of colonizing, influencing, and annexing other parts of the world.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/search.php?query=atlas%20world%20history%20haywood John Haywood, ''Atlas of world history'' (1997)]&lt;/ref&gt;  19th century episodes included  the "[[Scramble for Africa]]."&lt;ref&gt;See Stephen Howe, ed., ''The New Imperial Histories Reader'' (2009) [https://h-net.org/reviews/showrev.php?id=32358 online review].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Colonial Africa 1913 map.svg|thumb|right|upright=1.2|[[Scramble for Africa|Africa]], divided into colonies under multiple empires, c. 1913]]

In the 1970s British historians [[John Andrew Gallagher|John Gallagher]] (1919–1980) and [[Ronald Robinson]] (1920–1999) argued that European leaders rejected the notion that "imperialism" required formal, legal control by one government over a colonial region. Much more important was informal control of independent areas.&lt;ref&gt;R.E. Robinson and John Gallagher, '' Africa and the Victorians: The official mind of imperialism'' (1966).&lt;/ref&gt; According to Wm. Roger Louis, "In their view, historians have been mesmerized by formal empire and maps of the world with regions colored red. The bulk of British emigration, trade, and capital went to areas outside the formal British Empire. Key to their thinking is the idea of empire 'informally if possible and formally if necessary.'"&lt;ref&gt;Wm. Roger Louis, ''Imperialism'' (1976) p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;  Oron Hale says that Gallagher and Robinson looked at the British involvement in Africa where they "found few capitalists, less capital, and not much pressure from the alleged traditional promoters of colonial expansion.  Cabinet decisions to annex or not to annex were made, usually on the basis of political or geopolitical considerations."&lt;ref name="Hale"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hale |first1=Oron J. |title=The great illusion: 1900–14 |date=1971 |publisher=Harper &amp; Row |location=New York |oclc=299740150}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|6}}

Looking at the main empires from 1875–1914, historians estimate a mixed record in terms of profitability.  At first planners expected that colonies would provide an excellent captive market for manufactured items.  Apart from India, this was seldom true.  By the 1890s, imperialists saw the economic benefit primarily in the production of inexpensive raw materials to feed the domestic manufacturing sector.  Overall, Great Britain did very well in terms of profits from India,  but not from most of the rest of its empire.  The Netherlands did very well in the East Indies. Germany and Italy got very little trade or raw materials from their empires. France did slightly better. The Belgian Congo was notoriously profitable when it was a capitalistic rubber plantation owned and operated by King Leopold II as a private enterprise.  However, scandal after scandal regarding very badly mistreated labour led the international community to force the government of Belgium to take it over in 1908, and it became much less profitable.  The Philippines cost the United States much more than expected because of military action against rebels.&lt;ref name="Hale"/&gt;{{rp|7–10}}

Because of the resources made available by imperialism, the world's economy grew significantly and became much more interconnected in the decades before [[World War I]], making the many imperial powers rich and prosperous.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last= Christopher|first= A.J.|title= Patterns of British Overseas Investment in Land|journal= Transactions of the Institute of British Geographers|year= 1985|volume= 10|series= New Series|issue= 4|pages= 452–66|doi= 10.2307/621891|jstor= 621891}}&lt;!--|accessdate= November 14, 2012--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Europe's expansion into territorial imperialism was largely focused on economic growth by collecting resources from colonies, in combination with assuming political control by military and political means. The colonization of India in the mid-18th century offers an example of this focus: there, the "British exploited the political weakness of the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] state, and, while military activity was important at various times, the economic and administrative incorporation of local elites was also of crucial significance" for the establishment of control over the subcontinent's resources, markets, and manpower.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Joe Painter|title=Politics, Geography and Political Geography: A Critical Perspective|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Aa7tAAAAMAAJ|year=1995|publisher=E.

Modern empires were not artificially constructed economic machines. The second expansion of Europe was a complex historical process in which political, social and emotional forces in Europe and on the periphery were more influential than calculated imperialism. Individual colonies might serve an economic purpose; collectively no empire had any definable function, economic or otherwise. Empires represented only a particular phase in the ever-changing relationship of Europe with the rest of the world: analogies with industrial systems or investment in real estate were simply misleading.&lt;ref name="Painter &amp; Jeffrey"/&gt;{{rp|184}}

European expansion greatly accelerated in the 19th century. To obtain raw materials, Europe expanded imports from other countries and from the colonies. European industrialists sought raw materials such as dyes, cotton, vegetable oils, and metal ores from overseas. Concurrently, industrialization was quickly making Europe the center of manufacturing and economic growth, driving resource needs.&lt;ref name="Adas 2008 54-58"&gt;

Communication became much more advanced during European expansion. With the invention of railroads and telegraphs, it became easier to communicate with other countries and to extend the administrative control of a home nation over its colonies. Steam railroads and steam-driven ocean shipping made possible the fast, cheap transport of massive amounts of goods to and from colonies.&lt;ref name="Adas 2008 54-58"/&gt;

Along with advancements in communication, Europe also continued to advance in military technology. European chemists made new explosives that made artillery much more deadly.  By the 1880s, the [[machine gun]] had become a reliable battlefield weapon. This technology gave European armies an advantage over their opponents, as armies in less-developed countries were still fighting with arrows, swords, and leather shields (e.g. the Zulus in Southern Africa during the [[Anglo-Zulu War]] of 1879).&lt;ref name="Adas 2008 54-58"/&gt;

==Theories of imperialism==

Anglophone academic studies often base their theories regarding imperialism on the British experience of Empire. The term ''imperialism'' was originally introduced into English in its present sense in the late 1870s by opponents of the allegedly aggressive and ostentatious imperial policies of [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|British Prime Minister]] [[Benjamin Disraeli]]. Supporters of "imperialism" such as [[Joseph Chamberlain]] quickly appropriated the concept. For some,{{Who|date=September 2016}} imperialism designated a policy of idealism and philanthropy; others alleged that it was characterized by political self-interest, and a growing number associated it with capitalist greed.

[[John A. Hobson]], A leading English Liberal, developed a highly influential interpretation of ''Imperialism: A Study'' (1902) that expanded on his belief that free enterprise capitalism had a negative impact on the majority of the population.  In ''Imperialism'' he argued that the financing of overseas empires drained money that was needed at home.  It was invested abroad because lower wages paid the workers overseas made for higher profits and higher rates of return, compared to domestic wages.  So although domestic wages remained higher, they did not grow nearly as fast as they might have otherwise.  Exporting capital, he concluded, put a lid on the growth of domestic wages in the domestic standard of living. .  By the 1970s, historians such as David K. Fieldhouse&lt;ref&gt;David K. Fieldhouse,  "‘Imperialism’: An Historiographical Revision" ''Economic History Review ''14.2 (1961): 187–209.&lt;/ref&gt; and Oron Hale could argue that "the Hobsonian foundation has been almost completely demolished."&lt;ref name="Hale"/&gt;{{rp|5–6}}  The British experience failed to support it.  However, European Socialists picked up Hobson's ideas and made it into their own theory of imperialism, most notably in Lenin's ''Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism'' (1916). Lenin portrayed [[Theory of Imperialism|Imperialism as the closure of the world market and the end of capitalist free-competition]] that arose from the need for capitalist economies to constantly expand investment, material resources and manpower in such a way that necessitated colonial expansion. Later Marxist theoreticians echo this conception of imperialism as a structural feature of capitalism. which explained the World War as the battle between imperialists for control of external markets.  Lenin's treatise became a standard textbook that flourished until the Collapse of communism in 1989–91.&lt;ref&gt;Tony Brewer, ''Marxist theories of imperialism: a critical survey'' (2002)&lt;/ref&gt;

Some theoreticians on the non-Communist left have emphasized the structural or systemic character of "imperialism". Such writers have expanded the period associated with the term so that it now designates neither a policy, nor a short space of decades in the late 19th century, but a world system extending over a period of centuries, often going back to [[Christopher Columbus]] and, in some accounts, to the [[Crusades]]. As the application of the term has expanded, its meaning has shifted along five distinct but often parallel axes: the moral, the economic, the systemic, the cultural, and the temporal. Those changes reflect—among other shifts in sensibility—a growing unease, even great distaste, with the pervasiveness of such power, specifically, Western power.&lt;ref&gt;Mark F. Proudman, "Words for Scholars: The Semantics of 'Imperialism'", ''Journal of the Historical Society'', Sept. 2008, Vol. 8 Issue 3, pp.&amp;nbsp;395–433&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;D. K. Fieldhouse, "Imperialism": A Historiographical Revision," ''South African Journal of Economic History,'' (1992) 7#1 pp.&amp;nbsp;45–72&lt;/ref&gt;

Historians and political theorists have long debated the correlation between capitalism, class and imperialism. Much of the debate was pioneered by such theorists as J. A. Hobson (1858–1940), [[Joseph Schumpeter]] (1883–1950), [[Thorstein Veblen]] (1857–1929), and [[Norman Angell]] (1872–1967). While these non-Marxist writers were at their most prolific before World War I, they remained active in the [[Interwar period|interwar years]]. Their combined work informed the study of imperialism and its impact on Europe, as well as contributing to reflections on the rise of the military-political complex in the United States from the 1950s. Hobson argued that domestic social reforms could cure the international disease of imperialism by removing its economic foundation. Hobson theorized that state intervention through taxation could boost broader consumption, create wealth, and encourage a peaceful, tolerant, multipolar world order.&lt;ref&gt;P. J.

[[Walter Rodney]], in his 1972 classic [[How Europe Underdeveloped Africa]], proposes the idea that imperialism is a phase of capitalism "in which Western European capitalist countries, the U.S.A., and Japan established political, economic, military and cultural hegemony over other parts of the world which were initially at a lower level and therefore could not resist domination."&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; As a result, Imperialism "for many years embraced the whole world – one part being the exploiters and the other the exploited, one part being dominated and the other acting as overlords, one part making policy and the other being dependent."&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/589558|title=How Europe underdeveloped Africa.|last=Walter.|first=Rodney,|date=1972|publisher=Bogle-L'Ouverture Publications|isbn=0950154644|location=London,|oclc=589558}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Environmental determinism==
The concept of [[environmental determinism]] served as a moral justification for the domination of certain territories and peoples. The environmental determinist school of thought held that the environment in which certain people lived determined those persons' behaviours; and this validated their domination. For example, the [[Western world]] saw people living in tropical environments as "less civilized", therefore justifying colonial control as a [[civilizing mission]]. Across the three major waves of [[European colonialism]] (the first in the Americas, the second in Asia and the last in Africa), [[environmental determinism]] served to place categorically indigenous people in a racial hierarchy. This takes two forms, [[orientalism]] and tropicality.

Some geographic scholars under colonizing empires divided the world into [[climate zone | climatic zones]]. These scholars believed that Northern Europe and the Mid-Atlantic [[temperate climate]] produced a hard-working, moral, and upstanding human being. In contrast, tropical climates allegedly yielded lazy attitudes, sexual promiscuity, exotic culture, and moral degeneracy. The people of these climates were believed to be in need of guidance and intervention from a European empire to aid in the governing of a more evolved social structure; they were seen as incapable of such a feat. Similarly, orientalism could promote a view of a people based on their geographical location.&lt;ref&gt;

[[File:Resa del bacino del Brandewater.jpg|thumb|The end result of the [[Boer Wars]] was the annexation of the [[Boer Republics]] to the British Empire in 1902]]
Britain's imperialist ambitions can be seen as early as the sixteenth century. In 1599 the British [[East India Company]] was established and was chartered by Queen Elizabeth in the following year.&lt;ref name="Painter &amp; Jeffrey"/&gt;{{rp|174}} With the establishment of trading posts in India, the British were able to maintain strength relative to other empires such as the Portuguese who already had set up trading posts in India.&lt;ref name="Painter &amp; Jeffrey"/&gt;{{rp|174}} In 1767 political activity caused exploitation of the East India Company causing the plundering of the local economy, almost bringing the company into bankruptcy.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;"British Empire"British Empire | historical state, United Kingdom | Encyclopædia Britannica Online&lt;/ref&gt; By the year 1670 Britain's imperialist ambitions were well off as she had colonies in Virginia, Massachusetts, Bermuda, [[Honduras]], [[Antigua]], [[Barbados]], [[Jamaica]] and [[Nova Scotia]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;

Due to the vast imperialist ambitions of European countries, Britain had several clashes with France. This competition was evident in the colonization of what is now known as [[Canada]]. [[John Cabot]] claimed Newfoundland for the British while the French established colonies along the St. Lawrence River and claiming it as "New France".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.canadiana.ca/citm/themes/pioneers/pioneers3_e.html|title=New France (1608–1763)|website=Canada in the Making|accessdate=February 3, 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141008091712/http://www.canadiana.ca/citm/themes/pioneers/pioneers3_e.html|archivedate=October 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Britain continued to expand by colonizing countries such as New Zealand and Australia, both of which were not empty land as they had their own locals and cultures.&lt;ref name="Painter &amp; Jeffrey"/&gt;{{rp|175}} Britain's nationalistic movements were evident with the creation of the commonwealth countries where there was a shared nature of national identity.&lt;ref name="Painter &amp; Jeffrey"/&gt;{{rp|147}}

The "First" [[British Empire#"First" British Empire (1583–1783)|British Empire]] was based on [[mercantilism]], and involved colonies and holdings primarily in North America, the Caribbean, and India. Its growth was reversed by the loss of the American colonies in 1776. Britain made compensating gains in India, Australia, and in constructing an informal economic empire through control of trade and finance in Latin America after the independence of Spanish and Portuguese colonies in about 1820.&lt;ref&gt;Piers Brendon, ''The Decline and Fall of the British Empire, 1781–1997'' (2008) p. 61&lt;/ref&gt;  By the 1840s, Britain had adopted a highly successful policy of [[Economic history of the United Kingdom#19th century|free trade]] that gave it dominance in the trade of much of the world.&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence James, ''The Rise and Fall of the British Empire'' (1997) pp. 169–83&lt;/ref&gt; After losing its first Empire to the Americans, Britain then turned its attention towards Asia, Africa, and the Pacific. Following the defeat of Napoleonic France in 1815, Britain enjoyed a century of almost unchallenged dominance and expanded its imperial holdings around the globe. [[Royal Navy#1815–1914|Unchallenged at sea]], British dominance was later described as ''[[Pax Britannica]]'' ("British Peace"), a period of relative peace in Europe and the world (1815–1914) during which the British Empire became the global [[hegemon]] and adopted the role of global policeman.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refJohnston2008|Johnston]], pp.&amp;nbsp;508–10.{{Full citation needed|date=June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;[[#refOHBEv3|Porter]], p.&amp;nbsp;332.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sondhaus, L.

A resurgence came in the late 19th century with the [[Scramble for Africa]] and major additions in Asia and the Middle East. The British spirit of imperialism was expressed by [[Joseph Chamberlain]] and [[Archibald Primrose, 5th Earl of Rosebery|Lord Rosebury]], and implemented in Africa by [[Cecil Rhodes]]. The pseudo-sciences of Social Darwinism and theories of race formed an ideological underpinning during this time. Other influential spokesmen included [[Evelyn Baring, 1st Earl of Cromer|Lord Cromer]], [[George Curzon, 1st Marquess Curzon of Kedleston|Lord Curzon]], [[Herbert Kitchener, 1st Earl Kitchener|General Kitchener]], [[Alfred Milner, 1st Viscount Milner|Lord Milner]], and the writer [[Rudyard Kipling]].&lt;ref&gt;William L. Langer, ''The Diplomacy of Imperialism: 1890–1902'' (2nd ed. 1950) pp. 67–100&lt;/ref&gt; The British Empire was the largest Empire that the world has ever seen both in terms of landmass and population. Its power, both military and economic, remained unmatched. After the [[First Boer War]], the [[South African Republic]] and [[Orange Free State]] were recognized by Britain but eventually re-annexed after the [[Second Boer War]].

[[World War II]] had weakened Britain's position in the world, especially financially. [[Decolonization]] movements proliferated throughout the [[Cold War]], resulting in [[Indian independence movement|Indian independence]] and the establishment of independent states throughout Africa. British imperialism continued for a few years, notably with its involvement in the [[1953 Iranian coup d'état|Iranian coup d'état of 1953]] and in Egypt during the [[Suez Crisis]] in 1956. However, with the [[United States]] and [[Soviet Union]] emerging from World War II as the sole [[superpower]]s, Britain's role as a worldwide power declined significantly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Darwin|first1=John|title=Britain, the Commonwealth and the End of Empire|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/british/modern/endofempire_overview_01.shtml|publisher=BBC|accessdate=13 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===China===
{{main article|Chinese imperialism}}
Ancient China has been one of the world's oldest empires that still exist. Due to its long history of being imperialist expansion, China has been seen by its neighboring countries as a threat due to large population, giant economy, large military force as well as its territorial evolution in most of history of China.

Starting with the unification of China under the [[Qin Dynasty]], later Chinese dynasties continued to follow its form of expansions. The most successful Chinese imperial dynasties are [[Tang Dynasty|Tang]] and [[Qing Dynasty]], due to its expansions.

===France===
{{main article|French colonial empire}}
[[File:French empire.svg|thumb|upright=1.35|Map of the first (green) and second (blue — plain and hatched) French colonial empires]]

During the 16th century, the [[French colonization of the Americas]] began with the creation of [[New France]]. It was followed by [[French East India Company]]'s trading posts in [[Africa]] and [[Asia]] in the 17th century. France had its "First colonial empire" from 1534 until 1814, including [[New France]] ([[Canada (New France)|Canada]], [[Acadia]], [[Newfoundland]] and [[Louisiana (New France)|Louisiana]]), [[French West Indies]] ([[Saint-Domingue]], [[Guadeloupe]], [[Martinique]]), [[French Guiana]], [[Senegal]] ([[Gorée]]), [[Mascarene Islands]] ([[Mauritius Island]], [[Réunion]]) and [[French India]].

Its "Second colonial empire" began with the conquest of [[Algiers]] in 1830 and came for the most part to an end with the granting of independence to [[Algeria]] in 1962.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Aldrich, ''Greater France: A History of French Overseas Expansion'' (1996)&lt;/ref&gt; The French imperial history was marked by numerous wars, large and small, and also by significant help to France itself from the colonials in the world wars.&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Clayton, ''The Wars of French Decolonization'' (1995)&lt;/ref&gt; France took control of Algeria in 1830 but began in earnest to rebuild its worldwide empire after 1850, concentrating chiefly in North and West Africa ([[French North Africa]], [[French West Africa]], [[French Equatorial Africa]]), as well as South-East Asia ([[French Indochina]]), with other conquests in the South Pacific ([[New Caledonia]], [[French Polynesia]]).

[[File:LaGuerreAMadagascar.jpg|thumb|upright|left|French poster about the "[[Franco-Hova Wars|Madagascar War]]"]]

French Republicans, at first hostile to empire, only became supportive when Germany started to build her own colonial empire. As it developed, the new empire took on roles of trade with France, supplying raw materials and purchasing manufactured items, as well as lending prestige to the motherland and spreading French civilization and language as well as Catholicism. It also provided crucial manpower in both World Wars.&lt;ref&gt;[[Winfried Baumgart]], ''Imperialism: The Idea and Reality of British and French Colonial Expansion, 1880–1914'' (1982)&lt;/ref&gt; It became a moral justification to lift the world up to French standards by bringing Christianity and French culture. In 1884 the leading exponent of colonialism, [[Jules Ferry]] declared France had a [[civilising mission]]: "The higher races have a right over the lower races, they have a duty to civilize the inferior".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Emmanuelle Jouannet|title=The Liberal-Welfarist Law of Nations: A History of International Law|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=docaDtxWPK8C&amp;pg=PA142|year=2012|publisher=Cambridge UP|page=142|isbn=978-1-107-01894-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Full citizenship rights – ''assimilation'' – were offered, although in reality assimilation was always on the distant horizon.&lt;ref&gt;Raymond Betts, ''Assimilation and Association in French Colonial Theory, 1890–1914'' (2005)&lt;/ref&gt; Contrasting from Britain, France sent small numbers of settlers to its colonies, with the only notable exception of Algeria, where French settlers nevertheless always remained a small minority.

In the 19th and 20th centuries, the French colonial empire was the second-largest colonial empire in the world behind the British Empire, extending over 12,347,000&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (4,767,000 sq. miles) at its height in the 1920s and 1930s. France controlled nearly 1/10th of the Earth's land area, with a population of 110&amp;nbsp;million people on the eve of World War II (5% of the world's population at the time).&lt;ref&gt;Martin Thomas, ''The French Empire Between the Wars: Imperialism, Politics and Society'' (2007) covers 1919–1939&lt;/ref&gt;

In World War II, [[Charles de Gaulle]] and the [[Free France|Free French]] used the overseas colonies as bases from which they fought to liberate France. However, after 1945 anti-colonial movements began to challenge the Empire. France fought and lost a bitter war in [[Vietnam]] in the 1950s. Whereas they won the war in Algeria, de Gaulle decided to grant Algeria independence anyway in 1962. French settlers and many local supporters relocated to France. Nearly all of France's colonies gained independence by 1960, but France retained great financial and diplomatic influence. It has repeatedly sent troops to assist its former colonies in Africa in suppressing insurrections and coups d'état.&lt;ref&gt;Tony Chafer, ''The End of Empire in French West Africa: France's Successful Decolonization?''

German  participation in imperialism was negligible until the late 19th century.  Prussia unified the other states into the [[second German Empire]] in 1871. Its Chancellor, [[Otto von Bismarck]] (1862–90), long opposed colonial acquisitions, arguing that the burden of obtaining, maintaining, and defending such possessions would outweigh any potential benefits. He felt that colonies did not pay for themselves, that the German bureaucratic system would not work well in the tropics and the diplomatic disputes over colonies would distract Germany from its central interest, Europe itself.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Pakenham, ''The Scramble for Africa: White Man's Conquest of the Dark Continent from 1876 to 1912'' (1992) ch 12&lt;/ref&gt;

However, public opinion and elite opinion in Germany demanded colonies for reasons of international prestige, so Bismarck was forced to oblige. In 1883–84 Germany began to build a colonial empire in Africa and the South Pacific.&lt;ref&gt;Paul M. Kennedy, ''The Rise of the Anglo-German Antagonism, 1860–1914'' (1988) pp 167–83.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|doi=10.1093/past/48.1.119|title=Bismarck's Imperialism 1862–1890|journal=Past and Present|url=http://past.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/reprint/48/1/119.pdf|volume=48|pages=119–155|year=1970|last1=Wehler|first1=Hans–Ulrich}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The establishment of the [[German colonial empire]] started with [[German New Guinea]] in 1884.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|doi=10.1093/past/42.1.140|title=Domestic Origins of Germany's Colonial Expansion Under Bismarck|url=http://past.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/reprint/42/1/140.pdf|journal=Past and Present|volume=42|pages=140–159|year=1969|last1=von Strandmann|first1=Hartmut Pogge}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the [[Treaty of Versailles]], all German colonies were lost after [[World War I]].

===Japan===

[[File:Japanese Empire (orthographic projection).svg|thumb|right|upright=1.35|The Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere in 1942]]

[[File:Japanese Special Naval Landing Forces on the deck board of the IJN xxx, June 11th.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.35|[[Special Naval Landing Forces|Japanese Marines]] preparing to land. A modern doctrine in [[amphibious warfare]] was one of the reasons in the fast Japanese territorial expansion.]]

For over 200 years, Japan [[Sakoku|remained isolated from the rest of the world]], staying in a feudal system. However, in the 1850s [[Perry Expedition|military pressure by the United States]] and other world powers forced Japan to open itself to the world markets, ending the period of isolation. A [[Bakumatsu|period of conflicts and revolutions]] unleashed in the uncertainty of the new period, ending in 1867 with the reunification of the political power in only one leader: the Japanese Emperor. Everything was ready for Japan to embrace the [[Industrial Revolution]]. However, from the start the Japanese didn't look too enthusiastic on relying on other countries to obtain industrial manufactures and remaining forever an underdeveloped nation, key to this understanding is the traditional Japanese psyche of self-sustainability that made them survive isolated for centuries. Thus, Japan initiated a process of modernization through central planning and a firm direction of the government. This became one of the fastest modernization processes in world history: in a matter of few decades it went through the full technological evolution that took centuries in Europe. Japan's late industrialization example became a leading case for underdeveloped countries that suffered from European rule. By the early 1900s, Japan was a naval power that could hold its own against an established European power like Russia.

Without much natural resources and territory to sustain the increasing Japanese population that industrialization brought, Japan turned to imperialism and expansionism as a way to compensate for its lackings and also to strengthen itself, the national motto ''"Fukoku kyōhei"'' (富国強兵, "Enrich the state, strengthen the military") as a sign of this attitude. Also the mentioned typical self-sustaining mentality of the Japanese was a cause of this change in foreign policy.

And Japan was eager to take every opportunity. In 1869 they took advantage of the defeat of the rebels of the [[Republic of Ezo]] to incorporate definitely the island of [[Hokkaido]] to Japan. For centuries, Japan viewed the [[Ryukyu Islands]] as one of its provinces. In 1871 the [[Mudan incident]] happened: [[Paiwan people|cannibal Taiwanese aborigines]] murdered 54 [[Ryukyuan people|Ryūkyūan]] sailors that had their ship shipwrecked. At that time the [[Ryukyu Islands]] were claimed by both [[Qing China]] and Japan, and the Japanese interpreted the incident as an attack on their citizens. They took steps to bring the islands in their jurisdiction: in 1872 the Japanese [[Ryukyu Domain]] was declared, and in 1874 a [[Japanese invasion of Taiwan (1874)|retaliatory incursion to Taiwan]] was sent, which was a success. The success of this expedition emboldened the Japanese: not even the Americans could defeat the Taiwanese cannibals in the [[Formosa Expedition]] of 1867. Very few gave it much thought at the time, but this was the first move in the Japanese expansionism series. Japan occupied Taiwan for the rest of 1874 and then left owing to Chinese pressures, but in 1879 it finally annexed the [[Ryukyu Islands]]. In 1875 Qing China sent a 300-men force to subdue the Taiwanese cannibals, but unlike the Japanese the Chinese were routed, ambushed and 250 of their men were killed; the failure of this expedition exposed once more the failure of Qing China to exert effective control in Taiwan, and acted as another incentive for the Japanese to annex Taiwan. Eventually, the spoils for winning the [[First Sino-Japanese War]] in 1894 included [[Taiwan]].

In 1875 Japan took its first operation against [[Kingdom of Joseon|Joseon Korea]], another territory that for centuries it coveted; the [[Ganghwa Island incident]] made Korea open to international trade. [[Korea]] was annexed in 1910. As a result of winning the [[Russo-Japanese War]] in 1905, Japan took part of [[Sakhalin|Sakhalin Island]] from Russia. Precisely, the victory against the [[Russian Empire]] shook the world: never before an Asian nation defeated a European power, and in Japan it was seen as a feat. Japan's victory against Russia would act as an antecedent for Asian countries in the fight against the Western powers for [[Decolonization]]. During [[World War I]], Japan took German-leased territories in China's Shandong Province, as well as the [[Mariana Islands|Mariana]], [[Caroline Islands|Caroline]], and [[Marshall Islands]], and kept the islands as League of nations mandates. At first, Japan was in good standing with the victorious Allied powers of World War I, but different discrepancies and dissatisfaction with the rewards of the treaties cooled the relations with them, for example American pressure forced it to return the Shandong area. By the '30s, economic depression, urgency of resources and a growing distrust in the Allied powers made Japan lean to a hardened militaristic stance. Through the decade, it would grow closer to Germany and Italy, forming together the Axis alliance. In 1931 Japan took [[Japanese invasion of Manchuria|Manchuria]] from China. International reactions condemned this move, but Japan's already strong skepticism against Allied nations meant that it nevertheless carried on.

During the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]] in 1937, Japan's military invaded central China. By now, relations with the Allied powers were at the bottom, and an international boycott against Japan to deprive it of natural resources was enforced. Thus a military move to gain access to them was needed, and so Japan [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|attacked Pearl Harbor]], bringing the United States to World War II. Using its superior technological advances in [[naval aviation]] and its modern doctrines of [[amphibious warfare|amphibious]] and [[naval warfare]], Japan achieved one of the fastest maritime expansions in history, by the end of the [[Pacific War]], Japan had conquered much of East Asia and the Pacific, including the east of [[China]], [[Hong Kong]], [[Thailand]], [[Vietnam]], [[Cambodia]], [[Myanmar]], [[Malaysia]], [[Singapore]], the [[Philippines]], [[Indonesia]], part of [[New Guinea]] and many islands of the [[Pacific Ocean]]. Just as Japan's late industrialization success and victory against the Russian Empire was seen as an example among underdeveloped Asia-Pacific nations, the Japanese took advantage of this and promoted among its conquered the goal to jointly create an anti-European "[[Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere]]". This plan helped the Japanese gain support from native populations during its conquests. However, the United States were benefited by the long-term, [[attrition warfare|war of attrition]] and over time the massive output of their industrial muscle, together with improvements in their military doctrines, turned the war in their favor. Japan's defeat in 1945 meant that its imperial gains, along with the proposed Pan-Asian sphere, were lost altogether,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.lehigh.edu/~rfw1/courses/1999/spring/ir163/Papers/pdf/jamm.pdf| author=Joseph A.

===Ottoman Empire===

{{main article|Ottoman Empire|Territorial evolution of the Ottoman Empire}}
The Ottoman Empire was an imperial state that lasted from 1299 to 1922. In 1453, [[Mehmed the Conqueror]] besieged the capital of the [[Byzantine Empire]], resulting in the [[Fall of Constantinople]] after 1,500 years of Roman rule. Thereafter, making it the capital of the empire. During the 16th and 17th centuries, in particular at the height of its power under the reign of [[Suleiman the Magnificent]], the Ottoman Empire was a powerful multinational, multilingual empire, which invaded and colonized much of [[Southeast Europe]], [[Western Asia]], the [[Caucasus]], [[North Africa]], and the [[Horn of Africa]]. Its repeated invasions, and brutal treatment of Slavs led to the great [[migration of the Serbs]] to escape prosecution. At the beginning of the 17th century the empire contained [[Provinces of the Ottoman Empire|32 provinces]] and numerous [[Vassal and tributary states of the Ottoman Empire|vassal states]].

By the 18th century, the [[Russian Empire]] extended its control to the Pacific, forming a common border with the [[Qing Empire]]. This took place in a large number of military invasions of the lands east, west, and south of it. The [[Polish–Russian War of 1792]] took place after Polish nobility from the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]] wrote the [[Constitution of May 3, 1791]]. The war resulted in eastern [[Poland]] being conquered by Imperial Russia as a colony until 1918. The southern campaigns involved a series of [[Russo-Persian Wars]], which began with the [[Persian Expedition of 1796]], resulting in the acquisition of [[Georgia (country)]] as a protectorate. Between 1800 and 1864, Imperial armies invaded south in the [[Russian conquest of the Caucasus]], the [[Murid War]], and the [[Russo-Circassian War]]. This last conflict led to the [[ethnic cleansing of Circassians]] from their lands. The [[Russian conquest of Siberia]] over the [[Khanate of Sibir]] took place in the 16th and 17th centuries, and resulted in the slaughter of various indigenous tribes by Russians, including the [[Daur people|Daur]], the [[Koryaks]], the [[Itelmens]], [[Mansi people]] and the [[Chukchi people|Chukchi]]. The Russian colonization of Central and Eastern Europe and Siberia and treatment of the resident indigenous peoples has been compared to European colonization of the Americas, with similar negative impacts on the indigenous Siberians as upon the indigenous peoples of the Americas. The extermination of indigenous Siberian tribes was so complete that a relatively small population of only 180,000 are said to exist today. The Russian Empire exploited and suppressed [[Cossacks]] hosts during this period, before turning them into the special military estate [[Sosloviye]] in the late 18th century. Cossacks were then used in Imperial Russian campaigns against other tribes.&lt;ref&gt;Willard  Sunderland,  "An Empire of Peasants.

[[Bolshevik]] leaders had effectively reestablished a polity with roughly the same extent as that empire by 1921, however with an internationalist ideology: Lenin in particular asserted the right to limited self-determination for national minorities within the new territory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1913/crnq/index.htm |author=V.I.

[[Leon Trotsky|Trotsky]], and others, believed that the revolution could only succeed in [[Russia]] as part of a [[world revolution]]. Lenin wrote extensively on the matter and famously declared that [[Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism|Imperialism was the highest stage of]] [[capitalism]]. However, after Lenin's death, [[Joseph Stalin]] established '[[socialism in one country]]' for the Soviet Union, creating the model for subsequent inward looking Stalinist states and purging the early Internationalist elements. The internationalist tendencies of the early revolution would be abandoned until they returned in the framework of a [[client state]] in competition with the Americans during the [[Cold War]]. In the after Stalin period in the late 1950s, the new political leader [[Nikita Khrushchev]] put pressure on the Soviet-American relations starting a new wave of anti-imperialist propaganda. In his speech on the UN conference in 1960, he announced the continuation of the war on imperialism, stating that soon the people of different countries will come together and overthrow their imperialist leaders. Although the [[Soviet Union]] declared itself [[anti-imperialism|anti-imperialist]], critics argue that it exhibited traits common to historic empires.&lt;ref&gt;Beissinger, Mark R. 2006 "Soviet Empire as 'Family Resemblance,'" ''Slavic Review'', 65 (2) 294–303; Dave, Bhavna. 2007 Kazakhstan: Ethnicity, language and power.

=== Spain ===
Spanish imperialism in the colonial era corresponds with the rise and decline of the [[Spanish Empire]], conventionally recognized as emerging in 1402 with the conquest of the Canary Islands and fully dissolving by 1975 with the loss of Spanish Sahara. Following the successes of exploratory maritime voyages conducted during the [[Age of Discovery]], such as those undertaken by [[Christopher Columbus]], Spain committed considerable financial and military resources towards developing a robust navy capable of conducting large-scale, transatlantic expeditionary operations in order to establish and solidify a firm imperial presence across portions of North America, South America, and the geographic regions comprising the [[Caribbean basin]]. Concomitant with Spanish endorsement and sponsorship of transatlantic expeditionary voyages was the deployment of ''[[Conquistador]]s'', which further expanded Spanish imperial boundaries through the acquisition and development of territories and colonies.

==== Imperialism in the Caribbean basin ====
In congruence with the colonialist activities of competing European imperial powers throughout the 15th – 19th centuries, the Spanish were equally engrossed in extending geopolitical power. The Caribbean basin functioned as a key geographic focal point for advancing Spanish imperialism. Similar to the strategic prioritization Spain placed towards achieving victory in the conquests of the [[Aztec Empire]] and [[Inca Empire]], Spain placed equal strategic emphasis on expanding the nation's imperial footprint within the Caribbean basin.
[[File:Spanish Caribbean Islands in the American Viceroyalties 1600.png|thumb|Spanish colonies and territories in the Caribbean basin (c. 1490 – c. 1660)]]
Echoing the prevailing ideological perspectives regarding colonialism and imperialism embraced by Spain's European rivals during the colonial era, including the English, French, and the Dutch, the Spanish utilized colonialism as a means of expanding imperial geopolitical borders and securing the defense of maritime trade routes in the Caribbean basin.

While leveraging colonialism in the same geographic operating theater as its imperial rivals, Spain maintained distinct imperial objectives and instituted a unique form of colonialism in support of its imperial agenda. Spain placed significant strategic emphasis on the acquisition, extraction, and exportation of precious metals (primarily gold and silver). A second objective was the evangelization of subjugated indigenous populations residing in mineral-rich and strategically favorable locations. Notable examples of these indigenous groups include the [[Taíno|Taίno]] populations inhabiting Puerto Rico and segments of Cuba. Compulsory labor and slavery were widely institutionalized across Spanish-occupied territories and colonies, with an initial emphasis on directing labor towards mining activity and related methods of procuring semi-precious metals. The emergence of the ''[[Encomienda]]'' system during the 16th – 17th centuries in occupied colonies within the Caribbean basin reflects a gradual shift in imperial prioritization, increasingly focusing on large-scale production and exportation of agricultural commodities.

==== Scholarly debate and controversy ====
The scope and scale of Spanish participation in imperialism within the Caribbean basin remains a subject of scholarly debate among historians. A fundamental source of contention stems from the inadvertent conflation of theoretical conceptions of imperialism and colonialism. Furthermore, significant variation exists in the definition and interpretation of these terms as expounded by historians, anthropologists, philosophers, and political scientists.

Among historians, there is substantial support in favor of approaching imperialism as a conceptual theory emerging during the 18th – 19th centuries, particularly within Britain, propagated by key exponents such as [[Joseph Chamberlain]] and [[Benjamin Disraeli]]. In accordance with this theoretical perspective, the activities of the Spanish in the Caribbean are not components of a preeminent, ideologically-driven form of imperialism. Rather, these activities are more accurately classified as representing a form of colonialism.

Further divergence among historians can be attributed to varying theoretical perspectives regarding imperialism that are proposed by emerging academic schools of thought. Noteworthy examples include [[cultural imperialism]], whereby proponents such as John Downing and Annabelle Sreberny-Modammadi define imperialism as ''"...the conquest and control of one country by a more powerful one."''&lt;ref&gt;Downing, John; Ali Mohammadi; Annabelle Sreberny-Mohammadi (1995). ''Questioning the media: a critical introduction'' (2, illustrated ed.). SAGE. p. 482. {{ISBN|978-0-8039-7197-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Cultural imperialism signifies the dimensions of the process that go beyond economic exploitation or military force." Moreover, colonialism is understood as ''"...the form of imperialism in which the government of the colony is run directly by foreigners."''&lt;ref&gt;Downing; Sreberny-Mohammadi (1995). p.482.&lt;/ref&gt;

In spite of diverging perspectives and the absence of a unilateral scholarly consensus regarding imperialism among historians, within the context of Spanish expansion in the Caribbean basin during the colonial era, imperialism can be interpreted as an overarching ideological agenda that is perpetuated through the institution of colonialism. In this context, colonialism functions as an instrument designed to achieve specific imperialist objectives.

Such complaints led to the [[Geneva Agreement (1966)|1966 Geneva Agreement]] shortly after Guyana's independence and to the renewal of Venezuela's claim to two-thirds of Guyana's western territory, known as the Guayana Esequiba.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lucena|first1=Anais|title=Venezuela conmemora 54 aniversario de la intervención de Marcos Falcón Briceño en la ONU|url=http://www.radiomundial.com.ve/article/venezuela-conmemora-54-aniversario-de-la-intervención-de-marcos-falcón-briceño-en-la-onu|accessdate=30 September 2017|agency=Ministerio del Poder Popular para las Relaciones Exteriores|publisher=Radio Mundial|date=12 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://laguayanaesequiba.blogspot.de/2012/11/marcos-falcon-briceno-venezuela-ante-la.html ''Marcos Falcón Briceño, Venezuela ante la ONU'']&lt;/ref&gt;

|accessdate=2018-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; founded in 1971 to exclusively [[Marketing|market]] titles from independent client [[Publishing|publishers]] to the international book trade. As per other book wholesalers and distributors, IPG combines its client publishers’ books into a single list, comparable to the larger publishing houses. IPG’s distribution services to publishers include [[Warehouse|warehousing]], bill collecting, and sales to the book trade. IPG currently represents about 1,000&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ipgbook.com/publishers-pages-32.php&lt;/ref&gt; publishers. They are based in [[Chicago, Illinois]]. IPG distributes publishers based in [[Australia]], the [[United Kingdom]], [[Canada]], [[France]], [[Ireland]], [[Switzerland]], [[New Zealand]], [[Israel]], and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=IPG Book |title=The History of IPG| date=2018-05-11|url=https://www.ipgbook.com/history-pages-65.php

==Merger with Chicago Review Press==
In 1987, IPG was acquired by '''''[[Chicago Review Press]]''''' (CRP) an independent publisher founded at about the same time as IPG.

==Acquisition of other book distributors==
IPG acquired Paul &amp; Company, an 11-year-old distributor of university presses, in 2001. IPG now sells directly to universities.

In 2006, IPG acquired Trafalgar Square Publishing, founded in 1973, which is the distributor of more than 100 publishers from the UK, Australia, New Zealand, China, and Germany, representing more than 20,000 titles. Its roster includes [[HarperCollins]], [[Pan Macmillan]], and [[Penguin Random House]] from the UK and [[Allen and Unwin]] and Penguin Random House from Australia; these publisher's titles are not always issued in US editions.

In 2018, IPG acquired International Specialized Book Services (ISBS), an academic book distributor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title = IPG Acquires ISBS| work = PublishersWeekly.com| accessdate = 2018-07-08| url = https://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/industry-news/industry-deals/article/76510-ipg-acquires-isbs.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2019, IPG acquired the book distributor, [[Midpoint Trade Books]]. Speaking to Publishers Weekly, IPG's CEO, Joe Matthews said that the publishing industry "is consolidating because distribution rewards scale, requires expensive technology, and demands high-level access to customers."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=Publishers Weekly |title=IPG Acquires Midpoint Trade Books|first=Claire |last=Kirch |date=2018-09-04|url=https://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/industry-news/industry-deals/article/77902-ipg-acquires-midpoint-trade-books.html

Lynch studied at the [[University of Edinburgh]] (MA, 1952), and at the University of London (Ph.D., 1955).  He served in the [[British Army]] after [[World War II]] from 1945-48. He then taught at the [[University of Liverpool]] (1954–61) and, since 1961 has been teaching at the University of London. He was the director for the Institute of Latin American Studies at the [[University of London]] from 1974 until his retirement in 1987.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ilas.sas.ac.uk/about-us/news/professor-john-lynch-dies-91|title=Professor John Lynch dies at 91 {{!}} Institute of Latin American Studies|website=ilas.sas.ac.uk|language=en|access-date=2018-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The scope of his work expanded over the years: from the [[Río de la Plata|River Plate]] area to [[Latin America]] as a whole; and from the 18th to the 19th centuries.

He died on 4 April 2018 at the age of 91.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/thetimes-uk/obituary.aspx?n=john-lynch&amp;pid=188705218 Professor John Lynch]&lt;/ref&gt;
== Quotes ==

*"The profession of historian has greatly changed in recent years under the influence of social science and statistics. At a time when measurement and conceptualization are paramount, I consider that the historian still has a duty to be readable, not least outside of the profession and that the virtues of pragmatism, intuition, and a sense of style are as important as ever." (Contemporary Authors, v. 85-88, p.&amp;nbsp;363. Detroit, 1980)
"I first became interested in Latin American history out of ignorance and curiosity, eager to discover a new world of sources and events. Since then I have tried to remove a few academic blind spots in Britain by teaching and writing in this field, and also to contribute the view of an outsider to Latin Americans. It is a matter of particular pleasure not only that I have been invited to lecture in their countries but that my books have been translated into Spanish and received a sympathetic reception in the Hispanic world. It is a challenging world, though the challenge for the historian is a limited one. The historian would not claim to resolve the problems of the present, only to reveal the past that lies behind the present.” (Contemporary Authors, v. 85-88, p.&amp;nbsp;363. Detroit, 1980)

[[File:kavi file2.jpg|thumb|right|A Stanza from ''Kavirajamarga'' which praises the people for their literary skills]]
'''''Kavirajamarga''''' ({{lang-kn|ಕವಿರಾಜಮಾರ್ಗ}}) (850 C.E.)&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2010-03-22/bangalore/28148456_1_eco-friendly-lighting-sudha-murty Times of India - 8th-century book delights Sudha Murthy]&lt;/ref&gt; is the earliest available work on [[rhetoric]], [[poetics]] and [[grammar]] in the [[Kannada]] language.&lt;ref name="poetics"&gt;Kamath (2001), p 90&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="poetics1"&gt;Narasimhacharya (1988), p 2&lt;/ref&gt; It was inspired by or written in part by the famous [[Rashtrakuta]] King [[Amoghavarsha]] [[Amoghavarsha I|I]], and some historians claim it is based partly on an the [[Sanskrit]] text ''[[Kavyadarsha]]''. Some historians believe ''Kavirajamarga'' may have been co-authored by a poet in the king's court, the Kannada language theorist Sri Vijaya.&lt;ref name="poetics"/&gt;&lt;ref name="coauthor"&gt;Sastri (1955), pp 355-356&lt;/ref&gt;

The name literally means "Royal Path for Poets" and was written as a guide book for poets and scholars (''Kavishiksha''). From references made in this writing to earlier Kannada poetry and literature it is clear that a considerable body of work in prose and poetry must have existed in the preceding centuries.&lt;ref name="century"&gt;Sastri (1955), p 355&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
The pre-coronation name of Amoghavarsha I was Sharva. He was born in Sribhavan in 800 to Rashtrakuta King [[Govinda III]] during the king's return from his successful northern campaigns in [[Kanauj]].  This is known from the Manne records (803), Sirur plates and Sanjan records (871) of Amoghavarsha I.&lt;ref name="sharva"&gt;Kamath (2001), p 77&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sharva1"&gt;[[Bisheshwar Nath Reu|Reu]] (1933), p 67&lt;/ref&gt; Amoghavarsha I came to the throne in 814 at the age of 14 and took great interest in the Kannada language, culture, country and its people, and his writing ''Kavirajamarga'' goes into these details as well.&lt;ref name="interest"&gt;Narasimhacharya (1988), p 17&lt;/ref&gt; The work describes the entire region between the [[Godavari River|Godavari]] river in the north and [[Kaveri River|Kaveri]] river in the south as "Kannada country", which includes large territories north of modern Karnataka where Kannada is now not spoken.&lt;ref name="century"/&gt; An English translation of a quote from the writing goes as follows,&lt;ref name="quote"&gt;E.P Rice in Das (2005), p 141&lt;/ref&gt;

{{cquote| 
In all the circle of earth &lt;br&gt;
No fairer land you'll find &lt;br&gt;
Than that were rich sweet Kannada &lt;br&gt;
Voices the people's mind &lt;br&gt;
'Twixt sacred river twain it lies- &lt;br&gt;
From famed Godavari &lt;br&gt;
To where the pilgrim rests his eyes &lt;br&gt;
Only holy Kaveri... &lt;br&gt;
The people of that land are skilled &lt;br&gt;
To speak in rhythmic tone, &lt;br&gt;
And quick to grasp a poet's thought, &lt;br&gt;
So kindred to their own &lt;br&gt;
Not students only, but the folk &lt;br&gt;
untutored in the school, &lt;br&gt;
By instinct use and understand &lt;br&gt;
The strict poetic rules.}}

===Early writers and literary styles===
''Kavirajamarga'' makes important references not only to earlier Kannada writers and poets but also to early literary styles that were in vogue in the various written dialects of Kannada language. The aim of this writing was to standardize these written styles. The book dwells on earlier styles of composition; the ''Bedande'', the ''Chattana'', and the ''Gadyakatha'', and indicates that these styles were recognised by ''puratana kavi'' (''lit'', "earlier poets"). The term ''pruvacharyar'' (''lit'', earlier grammarians or rhetoricians) has also been used.&lt;ref name="style"&gt;Narasimhacharya (1988), p 12, p 17&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mug"&gt;Mugali R.S. (2006), pp 173-175&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="puratana"&gt;Sahitya Akademi (1988), pp. 1474–1475&lt;/ref&gt; The book mentions several early Kannada writers who preceded Amoghavarsha I: Vimalachandra (777), Udaya, Nagarjuna, Jayabhandu and 6th century King [[Durvinita]] of the [[Western Ganga Dynasty]] as the best writers of Kannada prose; Srivijaya, Kavisvara, Pandita, Chandra and Lokapala as the best writers of Kannada poetry.&lt;ref name="poetics1"/&gt; But the works and compositions of these early authors are yet to be discovered. ''Kavirajamarga'' was formative in the literary growth of Kannada and is a guide book to the Kannada [[grammar]] that existed in that period. It laid the "royal path" for guiding many aspiring writers.&lt;ref name="style"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mug"/&gt;

In his criticism, Amoghavarsha I writes that old Kannada is appropriate in "ancient poems" but is insipid in works of the present time, like an "association with an old woman".  According to him, a mixture of Kannada with Sanskrit is "harsh to the ear" but a mixture of Kannada and ''Sama-Samskrita'' is pleasant to the ear like "music", while a mixture of Kannada and Sanskrit in compounds is disagreeable "like mixing drops of buttermilk (curdled milk) and boiling milk".  He also condemned the usage of expletives such as ''ante'', ''matte,'' and ''gadam,''.&lt;ref name="style"/&gt;

[[File:Pointe levallois Beuzeville MHNT PRE.2009.0.203.2.fond.jpg|thumb|Levallois point{{snds}}[[Beuzeville]]]]
The '''Levallois technique''' ({{IPA-fr|lə.va.lwa|IPA}}) is a name given by [[archaeologist]]s to a distinctive type of stone [[knapping]] developed by precursors to modern humans during the [[Palaeolithic]] period.

It is named after nineteenth-century finds of [[flint]] tools in the [[Levallois-Perret]] suburb of [[Paris]], [[France]]. The technique was more sophisticated than earlier methods of [[lithic reduction]], involving the striking of [[lithic flake]]s from a prepared [[lithic core]]. A [[striking platform]] is formed at one end and then the core's edges are trimmed by flaking off pieces around the outline of the intended lithic flake. This creates a domed shape on the side of the core, known as a [[tortoise]] core, as the various scars and rounded form are reminiscent of a tortoise's shell. When the striking platform is finally hit, a lithic flake separates from the lithic core with a distinctive [[:wikt:plano-convex|plano-convex]] profile and with all of its edges sharpened by the earlier trimming work.

This method provides much greater control over the size and shape of the final flake which would then be employed as a [[Scraper (archaeology)|scraper]] or knife although the technique could also be adapted to produce [[projectile point]]s known as Levallois points. Scientists consider the Levallois complex to be a [[Stone_tool#Mode_III:_The_Mousterian_Industry|Mode{{nbsp}}3]] technology, as a result of its diachronic variability. This is one level superior to the [[Acheulean]] complex of the [[Lower Paleolithic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Foley|first1=Robert|last2=Lahr|first2=Marta Mirazón|title=Mode 3 technologies and the evolution of modern humans|journal=Cambridge Archaeological Journal|date=1997|volume=7.01|pages=3–36|doi=10.1017/s0959774300001451}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
The technique is first found in the [[Lower Palaeolithic]] but is most commonly associated with the [[Neanderthal]] [[Mousterian]] industries of the [[Middle Palaeolithic]]. In the [[Levant]], Levallois methods were also in use in the [[Upper Palaeolithic]] and later. In [[East Africa]], Levallois methods were used in the [[Middle Stone Age]]. While Levallois cores do display some variability in their planform, their flake production surfaces show remarkable uniformity. This would seem to indicate that some sort of teaching process was occurring, which some have speculated would have involved language.&lt;ref name="Lycettvon Cramon-Taubadel2013"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lycett | first1 = S.J. | last2 = von Cramon-Taubadel | first2 = N. | year = 2013 | title = A 3D morphometric analysis of surface geometry in Levallois cores: patterns of stability and variability across regions and their implications | url = | journal = Journal of Archaeological Science | volume = 40 | issue = 3| pages = 1508–1517 | doi=10.1016/j.jas.2012.11.005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evolution==
The distinctive forms of the flakes were originally thought to indicate a wide ranging [[Levallois culture|Levallois]] [[archaeological culture|culture]] resulting from the expansion of archaic Homo sapiens out of Africa. However, the wide geographical and temporal spread of the technique has rendered this interpretation obsolete.{{further|Prepared-core technique}} Adler et al., further argues that Levallois technology evolved independently in different populations and thus cannot be used as a reliable indicator of Paleolithic human population change and expansion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Adler | first1 = D. S. | display-authors = 1 | last2 = et al | year = 2014 | title = Early Levallois technology and the Lower to Middle Paleolithic transition in the Southern Caucasus | url = http://www.sciencemag.org/content/345/6204/1609.abstract#aff-1 | journal = Science | volume = 345 | issue = 6204| pages = 1609–1613 | doi=10.1126/science.1256484}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aside from technique, the overarching commonality in Levallois complexes is the attention given to maximizing core efficiency. Lycett and von Cramon-Taubedel (2013) measured variability in shape and geometrics relationships between cores over multiple regions, with an outcome that suggests a tendency for knappers to choose planforms with a specific surface morphology. In other words, they conclude that Levallois knappers cared less about the overall outline or shape of their core and more about the striking surface, evidence of complex pre-planning and recognition of an "ideal form" of Levallois core.&lt;ref name="Lycettvon Cramon-Taubadel2013"/&gt; A recent article by Lycett and Eren (2013) statistically shows the efficiency of the Levallois technique which at times has been called into question. Lycett and Eren created 75 Levallois flakes from 25 Texas Chert nodules. They counted the 3957 flakes and separated them into four stages in order to show efficiency, which grew subsequently in each stage.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lycett|first1=S.J.|last2=M.I.|first2=Eren|title=Levallois economics: and examination of 'waste' production in experimental produced Levallois reduction sequences. |journal=Journal of Archaeological Science|date=2013|volume=40|issue=5|pages=2384–2392|doi=10.1016/j.jas.2013.01.016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Based on the comparative study of 567 debitage flakes and 75 preferential Levallois flakes, Lycett and Eren found out the thickness is more evenly distributed and less variable across preferential Levallois flakes, which indicates the thickness is an important factor for efficiency and retouch potential.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Eren | first1 = M.I. | last2 = Lycett | first2 = S.J. | year = 2012 | title = Why Levallois? A Morphometric Comparison of Experimental 'Preferential' Levallois Flakes versus Debitage Flakes | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0029273 | journal = PLoS ONE | volume = 7 | issue = 1| page = 29273 | pmid=22291888 | pmc=3264556}}&lt;/ref&gt; The experiment&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; also shows that the Levallois core is an economic optimal strategy of raw material (lithic) usage, which means it can generate longest cutting edge per weight unit of raw material. This result also implies that the mobility of prehistoric people was higher when applying Levallois technology; prehistoric people may explore more area with Levallois cores, which can make longer cutting edge than the other flake making technique under same amount of cores, and no need to worry about the lack of raw material to make tools.

===Defining Levallois===
There is disagreement when it comes to defining Levallois technology.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Brantingham|first1=P. Jeffrey|last2=Kuhn|first2=Steven L.|title=Constraints on Levallois Core Technology: A Mathematical Model |journal=Journal of Archaeological Science|date=2001|volume=28|page=749|doi=10.1006/jasc.2000.0594 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Archeologists question which attributes and dimensions are specifically associated with Levallois, and argue that there are other techniques with similar cosmetic and functional aspects. Due to these disagreements, there is now a more precise set of criteria that outlines Levallois technology from a geometric standpoint. These criteria are:
# Exploitation of the volume of raw material is organized in terms of two intersecting planes, or flaking surfaces; 
# The two surfaces are hierarchically related, one constituting the striking platform and the other the primary reduction surface; 
# The primary reduction surface is shaped such that the morphology of the product is pre-determined, which is fundamentally a function of the lateral and distal convexities of the surface; 
# The fracture plane for removing primary products is sub-parallel to the plane of intersection of the two surfaces; and 
# The striking platform size and shape is adjusted to allow removal of flakes parallel to this plane, usually through retouch or faceting.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB" /&gt;

==Locations==
===Africa===
* Morocco: At [[Jebel Irhoud]], a former barite mine located 100km west of [[Marrakesh]], Levallois tools have been found. Dated as approximately 315,000 years old&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nature.com/news/oldest-homo-sapiens-fossil-claim-rewrites-our-species-history-1.22114&lt;/ref&gt; in 2017, the finds were highly significant to the understanding of both the development of this technique and early humans. John McNabb, archaeologist at the [[University of Southampton]] said of this: "The tools the people at Jebel Irhoud were making were based on a knapping technique called Levallois, a sophisticated way of shaping stone tools. The date of 315,000 years ago adds to a growing realisation that Levallois originates a lot earlier than we thought. Is Jebel Irhoud telling us that this new technology is linked to the emergence of the hominin line that will lead to modern humans? Does the new find imply there was more than one hominin lineage in Africa at this time? It really stirs the pot."&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/jun/07/oldest-homo-sapiens-bones-ever-found-shake-foundations-of-the-human-story&lt;/ref&gt;
* Egypt: Within the banks of the [[Nile River]], excavations have located within the 30-, 15-, and 10-foot terraces, Levalloisean implements. Within the 30-foot terrace, the implements were originally thought to be early [[Mousterian]], but were later reclassified. The 15- and 10-foot terraces again were classified first as Egyptian Mousterian, but later as developed Lavalloisean.&lt;ref name=Langer&gt;{{cite book|title=An Encyclopedia of World History| editor-last = Langer | editor-first = William L. |edition = 5th | publisher = Houghton Mifflin Company| location = Boston, MA| year = 1972 | isbn = 0-395-13592-3|pages = 9}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Kenya: Large Levallois flakes struck from boulder cores have been found at the [[Kapthurin|Kapthurin Formation]] site in western Kenya, near [[Lake Bogoria]] and [[Lake Baringo]]. The earliest examples come from the Leaky Handaxe Area and the Factory Site. Both examples feature large flakes, approximately 10–20&amp;nbsp;cm in diameter, and have been dated between 284 and 509 thousand years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tryon|first1=Christian A.|last2=McBrearty|first2=Sally|last3=Texier|first3=Pierre-Jean|title=Levallois Lithic Technology from the Kapthurin Formation, Kenya: Acheulian Origin and Middle Stone Age Diversity|journal=African Archaeological Review|date=December 2005|volume=22|issue=4|doi=10.1007/s10437-006-9002-5|pages=199–229}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He further concludes that this challenges the view that technological change resulted from population change, and suggests instead that Levallois technology developed independently from existing technology within different human populations who shared a common technological ancestry.&lt;ref&gt;Prehistoric Stone Tools Evolved Independently Within Local Populations, Say Researchers".

[[Judy Garland]] has been the subject of many biographies. Since her death in 1969, she has been the subject of over two dozen books. The first of these was Brad Steiger's ''Judy Garland'', published shortly after her death, which includes information on Garland's [[Astrology|astrological]] chart, [[Graphology|analysis of her handwriting]], [[numerology]] and [[biorhythm]]s. Most of the books are entirely about Garland, but some, including Patricia Fox-Sheinwold's ''Too Young to Die'', ''Some Are Born Great'' by [[Adela Rogers St. Johns]] and Jane Ellen Wayne's ''The Golden Girls of MGM'', merely feature a chapter about her. Two volumes, ''Rainbow's End: The Judy Garland Show'' by Coyne Steven Sanders and [[Mel Tormé]]'s ''The Other Side of the Rainbow: On the Dawn Patrol With Judy Garland'', focus on Garland's television series, ''[[The Judy Garland Show]]''. Garland's last husband, [[Mickey Deans]], co-authored an early biography in 1972 and Garland's daughter [[Lorna Luft]] wrote a family memoir in 1988.

Garland has been profiled on-screen several times. The earliest known film biography was a 1961 installment of the syndicated television series ''[[Hollywood Hist-o-rama]]'', which covered her career through the filming of ''[[A Star is Born (1954 film)|A Star is Born]]''. Garland was the subject of episodes of the British series ''[[Omnibus (UK TV series)|Omnibus]]'', ''[[60 Minutes]]'', ''[[Biography (TV series)|Biography]]'' and the ''[[E! True Hollywood Story]]''. Her life story was fictionalized in ''Rainbow'' in 1978 and in 2001 in ''[[Life with Judy Garland: Me and My Shadows]]'', based on daughter Luft's memoir. On stage, Garland is a character in ''[[The Boy from Oz]]'', a 1998 musical based on the life of former son-in-law [[Peter Allen (musician)|Peter Allen]], and the 2006 play ''The Property Known as Garland'', based on tape recordings made prior to her last ever concert appearance.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10294">'''''Mak nyah''''' ({{IPA-may|ˈmaʔ ˈɲa|}}), alternatively spelled '''''maknyah''''', is a [[Malay language|Malay]] vernacular&lt;ref name=Repository/&gt; term for [[Trans woman|trans women]] in [[Malaysia]]. It arose in the late 1980s in order to distinguish MTF trans women from other minorities.&lt;ref name="Equal Rights Trust"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Mak Nyahs of Malaysia: Testimony of Four Transgender Women|url=http://www.equalrightstrust.org/ertdocumentbank/ERR7_testimony.pdf|website=equalrightstrust.org|publisher=Equal Rights Trust|accessdate=1 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The name is preferred by [[Malaysia]]n trans women as opposed to various derogatory terms (namely, ''pondan'' and ''bapok''), which were previously used by [[Sarawak]]ians when referring to [[transsexual]]s and [[cross-dressing|cross-dressers]].&lt;ref name="Repository"&gt;{{cite web|author1=Caesar DeAlwis|author2=Maya Khemlani David|title=LANGUAGE AND IDENTITY OF MALAY TEENAGE MAK NYAH (TRANSVESTITES) IN KUCHING|url=http://repository.um.edu.my/1009/1/Caesar%20DeAlwis%20%26%20Maya%20-%20LANGUAGE%20AND%20IDENTITY%20OF%20MALAY%20TEENAGE%20MAK%20NYAH%20%20%28TRANSVESTITES%29%20IN%20KUCHING.pdf|website=repository.um.edu.my|accessdate=1 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; These are also considered slurs, which are variously directed to [[gay men]] as well as transgender individuals.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}} Though less used, the term ''[[pak nyah]]'' is sometimes used for [[trans men]], and the hybrid term ''mak-pak nyah'' for all transgender individuals.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

== Origins and definition of the term ==
''Mak nyah'' is formed from the word ''mak'', meaning 'mother',&lt;ref&gt;Tan Lay Ean, H., ''Jeffrey Jessie: Recognising Transsexuals'', The Malaysian Bar, 17 November 2005&lt;/ref&gt; and ''nyah'', meaning 'transition' (literally, 'to run from').{{citation needed|date=February 2015}} Khartini Slamah describes how the term arose in the transgender community: "[F]irst, [as] a desire to differentiate ourselves from gay men, transvestites, cross-dressers, drag queens, and other 'sexual minorities' with whom all those who are not heterosexual are automatically lumped, and second, because we also wanted to define ourselves from a vantage point of dignity rather than from the position of derogation in which Malaysian society had located us&lt;ref name="Slamah"&gt;Slamah, K., ''The Struggle to Be Ourselves, Neither Men Nor Women: Mak Nyahs in Malaysia'', in Misra, G. and Chandiramani, R. (eds.), ''Sexuality, Gender and Rights: Exploring Theory and Practice in South and South East Asia'', SAGE, 2005, p. 99-100&lt;/ref&gt; Slamah then goes on to explain that the term ''mak nyah'' does not necessarily refer to a MTF trans woman who has undergone [[sex reassignment surgery]] (SRS):&lt;ref name="Equal Rights Trust"/&gt; "''[M]ak Nyahs'' define themselves in various ways along the continuums of gender and sexuality: as men who look like women and are soft and feminine, as the third gender, as men who dress up as women, as men who like to do women's work, as men who like me, etc."&lt;ref name="Slamah"/&gt;

The term of ''mak nyah'' for Malay transgender women can be contrasted with other terms for the trans community around the world, such as ''[[Hijra (South Asia)|hijra]]s'' in [[India]], ''[[kathoey]]s'' in [[Thailand]] and ''occult'' in [[Myanmar]].&lt;ref name="Repository"/&gt;

== Language ==
''Bahasa Seteng'' (literally "half-language"), is a secret language used within the Malaysian transgender community, in order to reflect their identity. It is commonly used amongst teenage ''mak nyah''.&lt;ref name=Repository/&gt;

== Legal status ==
The ''mak nyah'' community in Malaysia experiences heavy discrimination, including discrimination in employment, housing and health care.{{sfn|Teh|2002}} In 2010, the governments of the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Australia]] recognised Malaysian transgender [[asylum seeker]]s, in response to the persecution and discrimination that they face in Malaysia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website=International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association|title=Trans Woman wins Asylum Claim|date= 27 July 2010|url=http://ilga.org/ilga/en/article/mxBoTUg1vy}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website=Fridae.asia|title=Malaysian transsexual given refugee status in Australia|date= 2 May 2010 |url=http://www.fridae.asia/newsfeatures/2010/05/04/9889.malaysian-transsexual-given-refugee-status-in-australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Malaysian courts have issued ambiguous messages as to whether a transgender individual's preferred [[gender identity]] or their birth [[sex]] should appear on their ID cards (''My Kad'').&lt;ref name="Equal Rights Trust"/&gt; For example, in ''Wong's case'',&lt;ref&gt;Wong Chiou Yong v Pendaftar Besar/Ketua Pengarah Jabata Pendaftaran Negara [2005] 1 CLJ 622.&lt;/ref&gt; the judge of the [[High Court of Ipoh]] upheld the refusal of the national Registration Department to amend or correct the Birth Certificate and National Registration Identity Card of the claimant who was a transsexual man.&lt;ref name="Equal Rights Trust"/&gt; However, in ''J.G.'s case'',&lt;ref&gt;J. G. v Pengarah Jabatan Pendaftaran [2005] 4 CLJ 710.&lt;/ref&gt; a judge of the [[High Court of Kuala Lumpur]], in dealing with a case which shared many similarities with ''Wong's case'', decised that the claimant's ID card be amended to acknowledge her gender identity.&lt;ref name="Equal Rights Trust"/&gt;

Under Section 21 of the Minor Offences Act 1955, ''mak nyah'' can be charged for indecent behaviour for dressing as women,{{citation needed|date=February 2015}} and Section 28 of the Syariah Criminal Offences (Federal Territories) Act 1997 prohibits any male person from wearing a woman's attire in a public place and posing as a woman for "immoral purposes".&lt;ref name="Equal Rights Trust"/&gt; Such a charge usually results in a small fine of [[Malaysian ringgit|RM]]25–50.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

=== Under Islam ===

In 1983, the Malaysian [[Conference of Rulers]] issued a ''[[fatwa]]'' which ruled that [[sex reassignment surgery]] should be forbidden to all except [[intersex]] people, on the basis that any other surgery was against [[Islam]],&lt;ref name="Equal Rights Trust"/&gt; as Islam only permits ''khunsa'' (intersex people) to undergo a sex change operation.{{sfn|Teh|2002}} Sunni Islam&lt;!--The source may not specifically say this, but in Shia Iran transgenderism is allowed--&gt; forbids males from cross-dressing, wearing make-up, injecting hormones to enlarge their breasts, and undergoing sex change operations.&lt;ref name="Repository"/&gt; Research shows that 78% of ''mak nyahs'' would prefer to have a sex change operation if their religion permits them to do so.{{sfn|Teh|2002|p=147}}

As the majority of ''mak nyah'' are Malay [[Muslim]]s, they can be further charged by a [[Sharia#Legal and court proceedings|''sharia'' court]],&lt;ref name="Repository"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Equal Rights Trust"/&gt; for which there is a fine of RM800–3000.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}} Laws such as these have been used by the Malaysian religious authorities (the ''Jabatan Hal Ehwal Agama Islam Negeri Sembilan'') to oppress the ''mak nyah'' community, through raids, interrogation, violence and detention.&lt;ref name="Equal Rights Trust"/&gt;

In addition, having SRS also causes a problem in terms of Islamic burial rites, which state that only a woman may be permitted to bath the body of a woman. This does not include ''mak nyah'' individuals, even if they have undergone SRS. However, ''maknyah'' individuals who underwent SRS could not be bathed by a man either.{{sfn|Teh|2002|p=101}}

== Statistics ==
It has been estimated that there are about 10,000 ''mak nyah'' in Malaysia.{{sfn|Teh|1998|165}} In the city of [[Kuching]] there are 700 ''mak nyah'' (75% Malays, the rest are [[Dayak people|Dayaks]] and [[Chinese people|Chinese]]).&lt;ref name="Repository"/&gt;

== Research ==
Teh Yik Koon wrote research documents on the ''mak nyah'', including a 1998 study and a 2002 book called ''The Mak Nyahs''. Andrew Hock Soon Ng, the author of "The Politics of Reclaiming Identity: Representing the ''Mak Nyahs'' in ''[[Bukak Api]]''," wrote that the book was "the most extensive scholarly work" on the ''mak nyahs''.&lt;ref&gt;Hock, Andrew Soon Ng.

{{God |isms}}

'''Monism''' attributes oneness or singleness (Greek: μόνος) to a concept e.g., existence. Various kinds of monism can be distinguished:
* ''Priority monism'' states that all existing things go back to a source that is distinct from them; e.g., in [[Neoplatonism]] everything is derived from [[Neoplatonism#The One|The One]].{{sfn|Brugger|1972}} In this view only one thing is ontologically basic or prior to everything else.
* ''Existence monism'' posits that, strictly speaking, there exists only a single thing, the [[Universe]], which can only be artificially and arbitrarily divided into many things.&lt;ref&gt;Strawson, G. (2014 in press): "Nietzsche's metaphysics?". In: Dries, M. &amp; Kail, P. (eds): "Nietzsche on Mind and Nature". Oxford University Press. [http://s3.amazonaws.com/academia.edu.documents/30981598/Nietzsches_Metaphysics_June_2012_Strawson_draft_-libre.pdf?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAJ56TQJRTWSMTNPEA&amp;Expires=1396293668&amp;Signature=Bji6%2FSyzFKV1jkuZRJfnLSB0Qko%3D PDF of draft]{{dead link|date=June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* ''Substance monism'' asserts that a variety of existing things can be explained in terms of a single reality or substance.{{sfn|Cross|Livingstone|1974}} Substance monism posits that only one kind of stuff exists, although many things may be made up of this stuff, e.g., matter or mind.

==Definitions==
There are two sorts of definitions for monism:
# The wide definition: a philosophy is monistic if it postulates unity of origin of all things; all existing things return to a source that is distinct from them.{{sfn|Brugger|1972}}
# The restricted definition: this requires not only unity of origin but also unity of [[Substance theory|substance]] and [[essence]].{{sfn|Brugger|1972}}

Although the term "monism" is derived from Western philosophy to typify positions in the [[mind–body problem]], it has also been used to typify religious traditions. In modern Hinduism, the term "absolute monism" is being used for [[Advaita Vedanta]].{{sfn|Chande|2000|p=277}}{{sfn|Dasgupta|1992|p=70}}

==History==
The term "monism" was introduced in the 18th century by [[Christian von Wolff]]&lt;ref name="Columbia" /&gt; in his work ''Logic'' (1728),&lt;ref name="jrank"&gt;[http://science.jrank.org/pages/7886/Monism.html jrank.org, ''Monism'']&lt;/ref&gt; to designate types of philosophical thought in which the attempt was made to eliminate the dichotomy of body and mind&lt;ref name="mastin" /&gt; and explain all phenomena by one unifying principle, or as manifestations of a single substance.&lt;ref name="Columbia"&gt;[http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/monism.aspx#4 "monism"], Columbia Electronic Encyclopedia, 6th Edition. Retrieved 29 October 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[mind–body problem]] in philosophy examines the relationship between [[mind]] and matter, and in particular the relationship between [[consciousness]] and the brain. The problem was addressed by [[René Descartes]] in the 17th century, resulting in [[Dualism (philosophy of mind)|Cartesian dualism]], and by pre-[[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]] philosophers,&lt;ref name="Young"&gt;{{cite book  |editor1=RC Olby |editor2=GN Cantor |editor3=JR Christie |editor4=MJS Hodges |title= Companion to the History of Modern Science |publisher=Taylor and Francis |year= 1996 |pages= 702–11 |isbn=0415145783 |chapter=The mind-body problem |url=http://human-nature.com/rmyoung/papers/pap102h.html |author= Robert M. Young |edition=Paperback reprint of Routledge 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Robinson&gt;{{cite web |author=Robinson, Howard |title=Dualism |work=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Winter 2011 Edition) |editor=Edward N. Zalta |url = http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2011/entries/dualism/ |date=Nov 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Avicennism|Avicennian philosophy]],&lt;ref name=Lagerlund&gt;{{cite book |title= Forming the Mind: Essays on the Internal Senses and the Mind/Body Problem from Avicenna to the Medical Enlightenment |publisher= [[Springer Science+Business Media]] |year= 2010 |edition=Paperback reprint of 2007 |isbn=  9048175305 |chapter=Introduction |page=3 |author=Henrik Lagerlund |editor= Henrik Lagerlund |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IV-dcQAACAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in earlier Asian and more specifically Indian traditions.

It was later also applied to the theory of absolute identity set forth by [[Hegel]] and [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling|Schelling]].{{sfn|Urmson|1991|p=297}} Thereafter the term was more broadly used, for any theory postulating a unifying principle.{{sfn|Urmson|1991|p=297}} The opponent thesis of [[Mind-body dualism|dualism]] also was broadened, to include pluralism.{{sfn|Urmson|1991|p=297}} According to Urmson, as a result of this extended use, the term is "systematically ambiguous".{{sfn|Urmson|1991|p=297}}

According to Jonathan Schaffer, monism lost popularity due to the emergence of [[Analytic philosophy]] in the early twentieth century, which revolted against the neo-Hegelians. Carnap and Ayer, who were strong proponents of [[positivism]], "ridiculed the whole question as incoherent [[mysticism]]".{{sfn|Schaffer|2010}}

The mind–body problem has reemerged in social psychology and related fields, with the interest in mind–body interaction{{sfn|Fiske|2010|p=195}} and the rejection of Cartesian mind–body dualism in the ''[[Type physicalism|identity thesis]]'', a modern form of monism.{{sfn|Fiske|2010|p=195-196}} Monism is also still relevant to the [[philosophy of mind]],{{sfn|Urmson|1991|p=297}} where various positions are defended.{{sfn|Mandik|2010}}{{sfn|McLaughlin|2009}}

===Types===
[[File:Dualism-vs-Monism.png|thumb|300px|A diagram with neutral monism compared to Cartesian dualism, physicalism and idealism.]]
Different types of monism include:{{sfn|Urmson|1991|p=297}}&lt;ref name=Schaffer&gt;Schaffer, Jonathan, Monism: The Priority of the Whole, http://www.jonathanschaffer.org/monism.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
# [[Substance theory|Substance]] monism, "the view that the apparent plurality of substances is due to different states or appearances of a single substance"{{sfn|Urmson|1991|p=297}}
# Attributive monism, "the view that whatever the number of substances, they are of a single ultimate kind"{{sfn|Urmson|1991|p=297}}
# Partial monism, "within a given realm of being (however many there may be) there is only one substance"{{sfn|Urmson|1991|p=297}}
# Existence monism, "the view that there is only one concrete object [[Type–token distinction|token]] (The One, "Τὸ Ἕν" or the [[Monad (philosophy)|Monad]])"&lt;ref&gt;Schaffer, Jonathan, "Monism", ''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' (Summer 2015 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), URL=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2015/entries/monism/&lt;/ref&gt;
# Priority monism, "the whole is prior to its parts" or "the world has parts, but the parts are dependent fragments of an integrated whole"&lt;ref name="Schaffer"/&gt;
# Property monism, "the view that all properties are of a single type (e.g., only physical properties exist)" 
# Genus monism, "the doctrine that there is a highest category; e.g., being"&lt;ref name="Schaffer"/&gt;

Views contrasting with monism are:
* Metaphysical dualism, which asserts that there are two ultimately irreconcilable substances or realities such as Good and Evil, for example, [[Manichaeism]],{{sfn|Brugger|1972}} 
* [[Pluralism (philosophy)|Metaphysical pluralism]], which asserts three or more fundamental substances or realities.{{sfn|Brugger|1972}}
* [[Nihilism|Metaphysical nihilism]], negates any of the above categories (substances, properties, concrete objects, etc.).

Monism in modern [[philosophy of mind]] can be divided into three broad categories:
# [[Idealism|Idealist]], mentalistic monism, which holds that only mind or spirit exists. {{sfn|Brugger|1972}}
# [[Neutral monism]], which holds that one sort of thing fundamentally exists,{{sfn|Mandik|2010|p=76}} to which both the mental and the physical can be reduced&lt;ref name="mastin"&gt;[http://www.philosophybasics.com/branch_monism.html Luke Mastin (2008), "Monism"]&lt;/ref&gt;
# [[Material monism]] (also called [[Physicalism]] and [[materialism]]), which holds that the material world is primary, and consciousness arises through the interaction with the material world&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Materialism and Empirio-criticism|last=Lenin|first=Vladimir|publisher=Foreign Languages Publishing House|year=1909|isbn=|location=World Socialist Web Site|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Mandik|2010|p=76}}
::a. [[Eliminativism|Eliminative Materialism]], according to which everything is physical and mental things do not exist{{sfn|Mandik|2010|p=76}}
::b. [[Reductive physicalism]], according to which mental things do exist and are a kind of physical thing{{sfn|Mandik|2010|p=76}}{{refn|group=note|Such as [[Behaviourism]],&lt;ref name="mastin" /&gt; [[Type-identity theory]]&lt;ref name="mastin" /&gt; and [[Functionalism (philosophy of mind)|Functionalism]]&lt;ref name="mastin" /&gt;}}

Certain positions do not fit easily into the above categories, such as [[functionalism (philosophy of mind)|functionalism]], [[anomalous monism]], and [[reflexive monism]]. Moreover, they do not define the meaning of "real".

===Monistic philosophers===

====Pre-Socratic====
While the lack of information makes it difficult in some cases to be sure of the details, the following [[Pre-Socratic philosophy|pre-Socratic philosophers]] thought in monistic terms:{{sfn|Abernethy|Langford|pp.1-7}}
* [[Thales]]: Water.
* [[Anaximander]]: Apeiron (meaning 'the undefined infinite'). Reality is some, one thing, but we cannot know what.
* [[Anaximenes of Miletus|Anaximenes]]: Air.
* [[Heraclitus]]: Change, symbolized by fire (in that everything is in constant flux).
* [[Parmenides]] argued that Being or Reality is an unmoving perfect sphere, unchanging, undivided.{{sfn|Abernethy|Langford|pp.8,9}}

====Post-Socrates====
* Neopythagorians such as [[Apollonius of Tyana]] centered their cosmologies on the [[Monad (philosophy)|Monad]] or One.
* [[Stoics]] taught that there is only one substance, identified as God.{{Citation needed|reason=This is a very broad generalization over a very diverse school of thought. Someone with time should seriously consider whether it is justified.|date=January 2018}}
* Middle Platonism under such works as those by [[Numenius of Apamea|Numenius]] taught that the Universe emanates from the Monad or One.
* [[Neoplatonism]] is monistic. [[Plotinus]] taught that there was an ineffable transcendent god, 'The One,' of which subsequent realities were emanations. From The One emanates the Divine Mind ([[Nous]]), the Cosmic Soul ([[Psyche (psychology)|Psyche]]), and the World ([[Cosmos]]).

====Modern====
* [[Giordano Bruno]]&lt;ref&gt;''De la causa, principio e Uno, London, 1584''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''De monade (De monade, numero et figura liber consequens quinque de minimo magno et mensura), Frankfurt, 1591''&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Baruch de Spinoza]]
* [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]]
* [[Alexander Bogdanov]]
* [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]]
* [[F. H. Bradley]]
* [[Arthur Schopenhauer]]

==Religion==

===Pantheism===
{{Main article|Pantheism}}
Pantheism is the belief that everything composes an all-encompassing, [[immanence|immanent]] God,&lt;ref name="Edwards"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Encyclopedia of Philosophy ed. Paul Edwards |publisher=Macmillan and Free Press |year = 1967 |location = New York|pages=34}}&lt;/ref&gt; or that the [[universe]] (or [[nature]]) is identical with [[divinity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | title = The New Oxford Dictionary Of English | publisher = Clarendon Press|year = 1998 | location = Oxford | pages = 1341|isbn = 0-19-861263-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pantheists thus do not believe in a [[personal god|personal]] or [[anthropomorphic]] god, but believe that interpretations of the term differ.

Pantheism was popularized in the modern era as both a theology and philosophy based on the work of the 17th century philosopher [[Baruch Spinoza]],&lt;ref name=Picton&gt;{{cite book|last=Picton|first=James Allanson|title=Pantheism: its story and significance|year=1905|publisher=Archibald Constable &amp; CO LTD.|location=Chicago|isbn=978-1419140082|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-_yjarZwEhoC&amp;pg=PP8}}&lt;/ref&gt; whose ''[[Ethics (Spinoza)|Ethics]]'' was an answer to [[Descartes]]' famous dualist theory that the body and spirit are separate.&lt;ref name=Plumptre /&gt; Spinoza held that the two are the same, and this monism is a fundamental quality of his philosophy. He was described as a "God-intoxicated man," and used the word God to describe the unity of all substance.&lt;ref name=Plumptre&gt;{{cite book|last=Plumptre|first=Constance|title=General sketch of the history of pantheism, Volume 2|year=1879|publisher=Samuel Deacon and Co|location=London|isbn=9780766155022|pages=3–5, 8, 29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the term pantheism was not coined until after his death, Spinoza is regarded as its most celebrated advocate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Shoham|first=Schlomo Giora|title=To Test the Limits of Our Endurance|year=2010|publisher=Cambridge Scholars|isbn=1443820687|pages=111}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Huw Owen|H. P. Owen]] claimed that
{{quote|Pantheists are "monists" ... they believe that there is only one Being, and that all other forms of reality are either modes (or appearances) of it or identical with it.&lt;ref&gt;H. P. Owen, 1971, p.65&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Pantheism is closely related to monism, as pantheists too believe all of reality is one substance, called Universe, God or Nature. [[Panentheism]], a slightly different concept (explained below), however is dualistic.&lt;ref&gt;Crosby, Donald A. (2008). Living with Ambiguity: Religious Naturalism and the Menace of Evil. New York: State University of New York Press. pp. 124. {{ISBN|0-7914-7519-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the most famous pantheists are the [[Stoics]], [[Giordano Bruno]] and [[Baruch Spinoza|Spinoza]].

===Panentheism===
{{Main article|Panentheism}}
Panentheism (from [[Greek language|Greek]] {{lang|grc|πᾶν}} (pân) "all"; {{lang|grc|ἐν}} (en) "in"; and {{lang|grc|θεός}} (theós) "God"; "all-in-God") is a belief system that [[postulate|posits]] that the divine (be it a [[monotheism|monotheistic]] [[God]], [[polytheism|polytheistic]] [[gods]], or an eternal cosmic animating force) interpenetrates every part of nature, but is not one with nature. Panentheism differentiates itself from [[pantheism]], which holds that the divine is synonymous with the universe.&lt;ref name="Erwin Fahlbusch, Geoffrey William Bromiley, David B. Barrett 1999"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=sCY4sAjTGIYC&amp;pg=PA21|title= The Encyclopedia of Christianity pg. 21|publisher= Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing|author1=Erwin Fahlbusch |author2=Geoffrey William Bromiley |author3=David B. Barrett |year = 1999|isbn = 0-8028-2416-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In panentheism, there are two types of substance, "pan" the [[universe]] and God. The universe and the divine are not [[ontology|ontologically]] equivalent. God is viewed as the eternal animating force within the universe. In some forms of panentheism, the [[cosmos]] exists within God, who in turn "[[Transcendence (religion)|transcends]]", "pervades" or is "in" the cosmos.

While pantheism asserts that 'All is God', panentheism claims that God animates all of the universe, and also transcends the universe. In addition, some forms indicate that the universe is contained within God,&lt;ref name="Erwin Fahlbusch, Geoffrey William Bromiley, David B. Barrett 1999"/&gt;  like in the concept of [[Tzimtzum]]. Much [[Hindu thought]] is highly characterized by panentheism and pantheism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/441533/pantheism/38168/Pantheism-and-panentheism-in-non-Western-cultures] Britannica - Pantheism and Panentheism in non-Western cultures&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Whiting, Robert. [https://books.google.com/books?id=_UfRgCZThWYC&amp;pg=PR8&amp;dq=shakti+panentheism&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=jz7nT6-kF8P3rQejn_GDCQ&amp;ved=0CDQQ6AEwADgK#v=onepage&amp;q=shakti%20panentheism&amp;f=false Religions for Today] Stanley Thomes (Publishers) Ltd. P. VIII. {{ISBN|0-7487-0586-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hasidic Judaism]] merges the elite ideal of nullification to paradoxical transcendent Divine Panentheism, through intellectual articulation of inner dimensions of [[Kabbalah]], with the populist emphasis on the panentheistic [[Divine immanence]] in everything and deeds of kindness.

[[Paul Tillich]] has argued for such a concept within Christian theology, as has [[liberal Christianity|liberal]] biblical scholar [[Marcus Borg]] and [[Christian mysticism|mystical]] theologian [[Matthew Fox (priest)|Matthew Fox]], an Episcopal priest.{{refn|group=note|See [[Creation Spirituality]]}}

===Pandeism===
{{Main article|Pandeism}}
Pandeism or pan-deism (from {{lang-grc|πᾶν|pan|[[The All|all]]}} and {{lang-la|[[deus]]}} meaning "[[god]]" in the sense of [[deism]]), is a term describing beliefs coherently incorporating or mixing [[logic]]ally reconcilable elements of pantheism (that "God", or a metaphysically equivalent [[creator deity]], is identical to [[Nature]]) and [[Deism#History of classical deism|classical deism]] (that the creator-god who designed the universe no longer exists in a status where it can be reached, and can instead be confirmed only by reason). It is therefore most particularly the belief that the creator of the universe actually became the universe, and so ceased to exist as a separate entity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title= The History of Science: A Beginner's Guide p. 90 |author = Sean F. Johnston |year = 2009 |ISBN = 1-85168-681-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alex Ashman, ''[[BBC News]]'', "[http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A25172309 Metaphysical Isms]".&lt;/ref&gt;

Through this [[synergy]] pandeism claims to answer primary objections to deism (why would God create and then not interact with the universe?) and to pantheism (how did the universe originate and what is its purpose?).

====Characteristics====
The central problem in Asian (religious) philosophy is not the body-mind problem, but the search for an unchanging Real or Absolute beyond the world of appearances and changing phenomena,{{sfn|Nakamura|1991}} and the search for liberation from [[dukkha]] and the liberation from the [[Reincarnation|cycle of rebirth]].{{sfn|Puligandla|1997}} In Hinduism, [[Substance theory|substance-ontology]] prevails, seeing [[Brahman]] as the unchanging real beyond the world of [[Maya (illusion)|appearances]].{{sfn|Puligandla|1997|p=50}} In Buddhism [[process ontology]] is prevalent,{{sfn|Puligandla|1997|p=50}} seeing reality as [[sunyata|empty]] of an unchanging essence.{{sfn|Kalupahana|1992}}{{sfn|Kalupahana|1994}}

Characteristic for various Asian religions is the discernment of levels of truth,{{sfn|Loy|1988|p=9-11}} an emphasis on [[Enlightenment (spiritual)|intuitive-experiential understanding]] of the Absolute{{sfn|Rambachan|1994}}{{sfn|Hawley|2006}}{{sfn|Sharf|1995}}{{sfn|renard|2010|p=59}} such as [[jnana]], [[bodhi]]  and [[kensho]], and an emphasis on the integration of these levels of truth and its understanding.{{sfn|Renard|2010|p=31}}{{sfn|Maezumi|2007}}

Vedanta is the inquiry into and systematisation of the Vedas and Upanishads, to harmonise the various and contrasting ideas that can be found in those texts.

* [[Advaita Vedanta]], absolute monism, of which [[Adi Shankara]] is the best-known representative;{{sfn|Flood|1996|p=239}}
* [[Vishishtadvaita]], qualified monism, is from the school of [[Ramanuja]];&lt;ref&gt;Jeaneane Fowler (2012), The Bhagavad Gita: A Text and Commentary for Students, Sussex Academic Press, {{ISBN|978-1845193461}}, page xxviii&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Shuddhadvaita]], in-essence monism, is the school of [[Vallabha]]; 
* [[Dvaitadvaita]], differential monism, is a school founded by [[Nimbarka]]; 
* [[Dvaita]], dualism, is a school founded by [[Madhvacharya]] is probably the only Vedantic System that is opposed to all types of monism. It believes that God is eternally different from souls and matter in both form and essence.
* [[Achintya Bheda Abheda]], a school of [[Vedanta]] representing the philosophy of ''inconceivable one-ness and difference''.

=====Advaita Vedanta=====
{{main article|Advaita Vedanta}}
Monism is most clearly identified in [[Advaita Vedanta]],{{sfn|Momen|2009|p=191}} though Renard points out that this may be a western interpretation, bypassing the intuitive understanding of a nondual reality.{{sfn|renard|2010}}

In Advaita Vedanta, [[Brahman]] is the eternal, unchanging, infinite, immanent, and transcendent reality which is the Divine Ground of all matter, energy, time, space, being, and everything beyond in this Universe. The nature of Brahman is described as transpersonal, personal and impersonal by different philosophical schools.&lt;ref name="Brodd, Jefferey 2003"&gt;Brodd, Jefferey (2003). World Religions. Winona, MN: Saint Mary's Press. {{ISBN|978-0-88489-725-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Advaita Vedanta gives an elaborate path to attain moksha. It [[logical consequence|entails]] more than self-inquiry or bare insight into one's real nature. Practice, especially Jnana Yoga, is needed to "destroy one’s tendencies [[Vāsanā|(vAasanA-s)]]" before real insight can be attained.&lt;ref name="Swartz"&gt;[http://www.advaita.org.uk/discourses/trad_neo/neo_vedanta_swartz.htm James Swartz, ''What is Neo-Advaita?'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Advaita took over from the Madhyamika the idea of levels of reality.{{sfn|Renard|2010|p=130}} Usually two levels are being mentioned,{{sfn|Renard|2010|p=131}} but Shankara uses [[Advaita vedanta#Criterion of Sublation|sublation]] as the criterion to postulate an ontological hierarchy of three levels:{{sfn|Puligandla|1997|p=232}}&lt;ref name=Discrimination&gt;[http://www.advaita-vision.org/discrimination/ advaita-vision.org, ''Discrimination'']&lt;/ref&gt;
* {{IAST|Pāramārthika}} (paramartha, absolute), the absolute level, "which is absolutely real and into which both other reality levels can be resolved".&lt;ref name=Discrimination /&gt; This experience can't be sublated by any other experience.{{sfn|Puligandla|1997|p=232}}
* {{IAST|Vyāvahārika}} (vyavahara), or samvriti-saya{{sfn|Renard|2010|p=131}} (empirical or pragmatical), "our world of experience, the phenomenal world that we handle every day when we are awake".&lt;ref name=Discrimination /&gt; It is the level in which both ''[[jiva]]'' (living creatures or individual souls) and ''[[Iswara]]'' are true; here, the material world is also true.
* {{IAST|Prāthibhāsika}} (pratibhasika, apparent reality, unreality), "reality based on imagination alone".&lt;ref  name=Discrimination /&gt; It is the level in which appearances are actually false, like the illusion of a snake over a rope, or a dream.

=====Vaishnava=====
{{Main article|Vaishnavism}}
All [[Vaishnava]] schools are [[panentheistic]] and view the universe as part of [[Krishna]] or [[Narayana]], but see a plurality of souls and substances within [[Brahman]]. Monistic theism, which includes the concept of a personal god as a [[Universality (philosophy)|universal]], [[omnipotent]] [[Supreme Being]] who is both [[Immanence|immanent]] and [[transcendence (religion)|transcendent]], is prevalent within many other schools of Hinduism as well.

=====Tantra=====
{{Main article|Tantra}}
[[Tantra]] sees the Divine as both immanent and transcendent. The Divine can be found in the concrete world. Practices are aimed at transforming the passions, instead of transcending them.

=====Modern Hinduism=====
{{Main article|Hindu reform movements}}
The colonisation of India by the British had a major impact on Hindu society.{{sfn|Michaels|2004}} In response, leading Hindu intellectuals started to study western culture and philosophy, integrating several western notions into Hinduism.{{sfn|Michaels|2004}} This modernised Hinduism, at its turn, has gained popularity in the west.{{sfn|Rambachan|1994}}

A major role was played in the 19th century by [[Swami Vivekananda]] in the [[Hindu reform movements|revival of Hinduism]],{{sfn|Dense|1999|p=191}} and the spread of Advaita Vedanta to the west via the [[Ramakrishna Mission]]. His interpretation of Advaita Vedanta has been called [[Neo-Vedanta]].{{sfn|Mukerji|1983}} In Advaita, Shankara suggests meditation and [[Nirvikalpa|Nirvikalpa Samadhi]] are means to gain knowledge of the already existing unity of ''Brahman'' and ''[[Ātman (Hinduism)|Atman]]'',{{sfn|Comans|1993}} not the highest goal itself:
{{quote|[Y]oga is a meditative exercise of withdrawal from the particular and identification with the universal, leading to contemplation of oneself as the most universal, namely, Consciousness. This approach is different from the classical Yoga of complete thought suppression.{{sfn|Comans|1993}}}}

Vivekananda, according to [[Gavin Flood]], was "a figure of great importance in the development of a modern Hindu self-understanding and in formulating the West's view of Hinduism."{{sfn|Flood|1996|p=257}} Central to his philosophy is the idea that the divine exists in all beings, that all human beings can achieve union with this "innate divinity",{{sfn|Flood|1996|p=258}} and that seeing this divine as the essence of others will further love and social harmony.{{sfn|Flood|1996|p=258}} According to Vivekananda, there is an essential unity to Hinduism, which underlies the diversity of its many forms.{{sfn|Flood|1996|p=258}} According to Flood, Vivekananda's view of Hinduism is the most common among Hindus today.{{sfn|Flood|1996|p=259}} This monism, according to Flood, is at the foundation of earlier Upanishads, to theosophy in the later Vedanta tradition and in modern Neo-Hinduism.{{sfn|Flood|1996|p=85}}

====Buddhism====
{{Main article|Buddhism}}
According to the [[Pāli Canon]], both pluralism (''nānatta'') and monism (''ēkatta'') are speculative [[View (Buddhism)|views]]. A [[Theravada]] commentary notes that the former is similar to or associated with [[nihilism]] (''ucchēdavāda''), and the latter is similar to or associated with eternalism (''[[sassatavada]]'').&lt;ref&gt;[[David Kalupahana]], ''Causality: The Central Philosophy of Buddhism.'' The University Press of Hawaii, 1975, page 88. The passage is SN 2.77.&lt;/ref&gt; See [[middle way]].

In the [[Madhyamaka]] school of [[Mahayana|Mahayana Buddhism]], the ultimate nature of the world is described as ''[[Śūnyatā]]'' or "emptiness", which is inseparable from sensorial objects or anything else. That appears to be a monist position, but the Madhyamaka views - including variations like ''[[rangtong]]'' and ''[[shentong]]'' - will refrain from asserting any ultimately existent entity. They instead deconstruct any detailed or conceptual assertions about ultimate existence as resulting in absurd consequences. The [[Yogacara]] view, a minority school now only found among the Mahayana, also rejects monism.

=====Levels of truth=====

Within Buddhism, a rich variety of philosophical{{sfn|Williams|1994}} and pedagogical models{{sfn|Buswell|1994}} can be found. Various schools of Buddhism discern levels of truth:
* The [[Two truths doctrine]] of the [[Madhyamaka]]
* The [[Three natures|Three Natures]] of the [[Yogacara]]
* [[Essence-Function]], or [[Chinese Chán#Absolute-relative|Absolute-relative]] in Chinese and Korean Buddhism
* The [[Trikaya]]-formule, consisting of 
** The ''[[Dharmakāya]]'' or ''Truth body'' which embodies the very principle of enlightenment and knows no limits or boundaries;
** The ''[[Sambhogakāya]]'' or ''body of mutual enjoyment'' which is a body of bliss or clear light manifestation;
** The ''Nirmāṇakāya'' or ''created body'' which manifests in time and space.&lt;ref name="Welwood, John 2007"&gt;Welwood, John (2000). [http://www.purifymind.com/PlayMind.htm ''The Play of the Mind: Form, Emptiness, and Beyond''], accessed January 13, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Prajnaparamita|Prajnaparamita-sutras]] and [[Madhyamaka]] emphasize the non-duality of form and emptiness: "form is emptiness, emptiness is form", as the [[heart sutra]] says.{{sfn|Liang-Chieh|1986|p=9}} In Chinese Buddhism this was understood to mean that ultimate reality is not a transcendental realm, but equal to the daily world of relative reality. This idea fitted into the Chinese culture, which emphasized the mundane world and society. But this does not tell how the absolute is present in the relative world:
{{quote|To deny the duality of samsara and nirvana, as the Perfection of Wisdom does, or to demonstrate logically the error of dichotomizing conceptualization, as Nagarjuna does, is not to address the question of the relationship between samsara and nirvana -or, in more philosophical terms, between phenomenal and ultimate reality [...] What, then, is the relationship between these two realms?{{sfn|Liang-Chieh|1986|p=9}}}}
This question is answered in such schemata as [[Five Ranks|the Five Ranks of Tozan]],{{sfn|Kasulis|2003|p=29}} the [[Ten Bulls|Oxherding Pictures]], and [[Hakuin#Four ways of knowing|Hakuin's Four ways of knowing]].{{sfn|Low|2006}}

==== Sikhism ====
{{Main|God in Sikhism}}
Sikhism complies with the concept of Priority&amp;nbsp;Monism. Sikh philosophy advocates that all that our senses comprehend is an illusion; God is the sole reality. Forms being subject to time shall pass away. God's Reality alone is eternal and abiding.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.allaboutsikhs.com/sikhism-articles/the-idea-of-the-supreme-being-god-in-sikhism|title=The Idea Of The Supreme Being (God) In Sikhism - Sikhism Articles - Gateway to Sikhism|last=User|first=Super|work=Gateway to Sikhism|access-date=2017-12-14|language=en-gb}}&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;The thought is that Atma (soul) is born from, and a reflection of, ParamAtma (Supreme Soul), and "will again merge into it", in the words of the Tenth guru of Sikhs, Guru Gobind Singh, "just as water merges back into the water."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thesikhencyclopedia.com/metaphysics/atma|title=ATMA,|last=Gujral|first=Maninder S|work=The Sikh Encyclopedia -ਸਿੱਖ ਧਰਮ ਵਿਸ਼ਵਕੋਸ਼|access-date=2017-12-14|language=en-gb}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Abrahamic faiths===

====Judaism====
{{Main article|Judaism}}
Jewish thought considers God as separate from all physical, created things ([[transcendence (religion)|transcendent]]) and as existing outside of time (eternal).{{refn|group=note|For a discussion of the resultant [[paradox]], see ''[[Tzimtzum]]''.}}{{refn|group=note|See also [[Negative theology#In the Jewish tradition|Negative theology]].}}

According to [[Hasidic philosophy|Chasidic Thought]] (particularly as propounded by the 18th century, early 19th century founder of [[Chabad]], [[Shneur Zalman of Liadi]]), God is held to be [[Immanence|immanent]] within [[Genesis creation myth|creation]] for two interrelated reasons:
# A very strong Jewish belief is that "[t]he Divine life-force which brings [the universe] into existence must constantly be present ... were this life-force to forsake [the universe] for even one brief moment, it would revert to a state of utter nothingness, as before the creation ..."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.chabad.org/library/archive/LibraryArchive2.asp?AID=7988&lt;/ref&gt;
# Simultaneously, Judaism holds as [[axiom]]atic that [[Jewish principle of faith#God is One|God is an absolute unity]], and that he is [[Divine simplicity#In Jewish thought|Perfectly Simple]]—thus, if his sustaining power is within nature, then his essence is also within nature.

The [[Vilna Gaon]] was very much against this philosophy, for he felt that it would lead to pantheism and [[heresy]]. According to some this is the main reason for the Gaon's ban on Chasidism.

According to [[Maimonides]],&lt;ref&gt;See ''Foundations of the Law'', Chapter 1&lt;/ref&gt; God is an incorporeal being that caused all other existence.  In fact, God is defined as the necessary existent that caused all other existence. According to Maimonides, to admit corporeality to God is tantamount to admitting complexity to God, which is a contradiction to God as the First Cause and constitutes heresy.  While Hasidic mystics considered the existence of the physical world a contradiction to God's simpleness, Maimonides saw no contradiction.{{refn|group=note|See the "Guide for the Perplexed", especially chapter I:50.}}

====Christianity====
{{See also|Christian anthropology}}

=====Creator–creature distinction=====
{{unreferenced section|date=April 2016}}
[[Christianity]] strongly maintains the creator–creature distinction as fundamental. Christians maintain that God created the universe ''[[ex nihilo]]'' and not from his own substance, so that the creator is not to be confused with creation, but rather [[transcendence (religion)|transcends]] it (metaphysical dualism) (cf. [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]]). Although, there is growing movement to have a "Christian Panentheism".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/53880197|title=In whom we live and move and have our being : panentheistic reflections on God's presence in a scientific world|last=1956-|first=Clayton, Philip,|last2=Robert)|first2=Peacocke, A. R. (Arthur|date=2004|publisher=William B. Eerdmans Pub|isbn=0802809782|oclc=53880197}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even more immanent concepts and theologies are to be defined together with God's omnipotence, omnipresence and omniscience, due to God's desire for intimate contact with his own creation (cf. Acts 17:27). Another use of the term "monism" is in [[Christian anthropology]] to refer to the innate nature of humankind as being [[holistic]], as usually opposed to [[bipartite (theology)|bipartite]] and [[tripartite (theology)|tripartite]] views.

=====Rejection of radical dualism=====
In ''[[De libero arbitrio (Augustine)|On Free Choice of the Will]]'', [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]] argued, in the context of [[the problem of evil]], that evil is not the opposite of good, but rather merely the absence of good, something that does not have existence in itself. Likewise, [[C. S. Lewis]] described evil as a "parasite" in ''[[Mere Christianity]]'', as he viewed evil as something that cannot exist without good to provide it with existence. Lewis went on to argue against dualism from the basis of [[moral absolutism]], and rejected the dualistic notion that God and [[Satan]] are  opposites, arguing instead that God has no equal, hence no opposite. Lewis rather viewed Satan as the opposite of [[Michael (archangel)|Michael the archangel]]. Due to this, Lewis instead argued for a more limited type of dualism.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, C.S, "God and Evil" in "God in the Dock: Essays in Theology and Ethics", ed. W. Hooper (Grand Rapids, Mich, Eerdsmans, 1970), p. 21-24&lt;/ref&gt; Other theologians, such as [[Greg Boyd (theologian)|Greg Boyd]], have argued in more depth that the Biblical authors held a "limited dualism", meaning that God and Satan do engage in real battle, but only due to free will given by God, for the duration God allows.&lt;ref&gt;Boyd, Gregory. A, "God at War" (Downers Grove, IL, InterVarsity Press, 1971) p. 185&lt;/ref&gt;

Isaiah 45:5-7
5 I am the Lord, and there is none else, there is no God beside me: I girded thee, though thou hast not known me:
6 That they may know from the rising of the sun, and from the west, that there is none beside me. I am the Lord, and there is none else.
7 I form the light, and create darkness: I make peace, and create evil: I the Lord do all these things.

=====Theosis=====
In [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholicism]] and [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodoxy]], while human beings are not ontologically identical with the Creator, they are nonetheless capable with uniting with his Divine Nature via [[Divinization (Christian)|theosis]], and especially, through the devout reception of the [[Eucharist|Holy Eucharist]].{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} This is a supernatural union, over and above that natural union, of which [[St. John of the Cross]] says, "it must be known that God dwells and is present substantially in every soul, even in that of the greatest sinner in the world, and this union is natural." [[Julian of Norwich]], while maintaining the orthodox duality of Creator and creature, nonetheless speaks of God as "the true Father and true Mother" of all natures; thus, he indwells them substantially and thus preserves them from annihilation, as without this sustaining indwelling everything would cease to exist.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

However, in [[Eastern Orthodoxy]] creation is united to God by grace and not by nature. This is what is known as the [[Essence-Energies distinction]], while in union with God, Orthodox Christians believe, the human person retains its individuality and is not swallowed up by the Monad.

=====Christian Monism=====
Some Christian theologians are avowed monists, such as [[Paul Tillich]]. Since God is he "in whom we live and move and have our being" ([[Book of Acts]] 17.28), it follows that everything that has being partakes in God.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

====Islam====
{{See also|Tawhid}}

=====Quran=====
[[Vincent Cornell]] argues that the [[Quran]] provides a monist image of God by describing reality as a unified whole, with God being a single concept that would describe or ascribe all existing things. But most argue that Semitic religious scriptures, especially the Quran, see creation and God as two separate existences. It explains that everything has been created by God and is under his control, but at the same time distinguishes creation as being dependent on the existence of God.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Yusuf |first1=Hamza |title=The Creed of Imam al-Tahawi |date=2009 |url=https://www.amazon.com/Creed-Imam-al-Tahawi-Hamza-Yusuf/dp/097028439X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Sufism=====
{{See also|Sufism}}
Sufi mystics advocate monism. One of the most notable being the 13th-century Persian poet [[Rumi]] (1207–73) in his didactic poem ''[[Masnavi]]'' espoused monism.&lt;ref name="nicholson"&gt;[http://www.globalwebpost.com/farooqm/study_res/rumi/intro_nicholson.html Reynold Nicholson ''Rumi''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061017141204/http://www.globalwebpost.com/farooqm/study_res/rumi/intro_nicholson.html |date=2006-10-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rumi.org.uk/sufism/persian_sufism.htm Cyprian Rice (1964) ''The Persian Sufism'' George Allen, London]&lt;/ref&gt; Rumi says in the [[Masnavi]],
{{quote|In the shop for Unity (wahdat); anything that you see there except the One is an idol.&lt;ref name="nicholson" /&gt;}}

The most influential of the [[Islam|Islamic]] monists was the Sufi philosopher [[Ibn Arabi]] (1165–1240). He developed the concept of 'unity of being' (Arabic: ''[[Sufi metaphysics|waḥdat al-wujūd]]''), a pantheistic monoist philosophy. Born in [[al-Andalus]], he made an enormous impact on the Muslim world, where he was crowned "the great Master". In the centuries following his death, his ideas became increasingly controversial.

===Bahá'í===
{{Main article|Bahá'í Faith and the unity of religion}}
Although the [[Bahá'í teachings]] have a strong emphasis on social and ethical issues, there exist a number of foundational texts that have been described as mystical.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|year = 1992|contribution = The Bahá'í Faith|title = Britannica Book of the Year
|isbn = 0-85229-486-7|editor1=Daphne Daume |editor2=Louise Watson |publisher = Encyclopædia Britannica|location = Chicago | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these include statements of a monist nature (e.g., ''[[The Seven Valleys]]'' and the ''[[Hidden Words]]''). The differences between dualist and monist views are reconciled by the teaching that these opposing viewpoints are caused by differences in the observers themselves, not in that which is observed. This is not a 'higher truth/lower truth' position. God is unknowable. For man it is impossible to acquire any direct knowledge of God or the Absolute, because any knowledge that one has, is relative.&lt;ref name="momen1988"&gt;{{cite book | last =Momen | first = Moojan |year = 1988 | title = Studies in the Bábí and Bahá’í Religions vol. 5, chapter: A Basis For Bahá’í Metaphysics | publisher = Kalimat Press | pages = 185–217 | url = http://bahai-library.com/momen_relativism_bahai_metaphysics | isbn = 0-933770-72-3 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Non-dualism===
{{Main article|Nondualism}}
According to nondualism, many forms of religion are based on an experiential or intuitive understanding of "the Real".{{sfn|Renard|2010|p=59}} Nondualism, a modern reinterpretation of these religions, prefers the term "nondualism", instead of monism, because this understanding is "nonconceptual", "not graspable in an idea".{{sfn|Renard|2010|p=59}}{{refn|group=note|In Dutch: "Niet in een denkbeeld te vatten".{{sfn|Renard|2010|p=59}}}}{{refn|group=note|According to Renard, [[Alan Watts]] has explained the difference between "non-dualism" and "monism" in ''The Supreme Identity'', Faber and Faber 1950, p.69 and 95; ''The Way of Zen'', Pelican-edition 1976, p.59-60.{{sfn|Renard|2010|p=59, p.285 note 17}} According to Renard, Alan Watts has been one of the main contributors to thepopularisation of the notion of "nondualism".{{sfn|Renard|2010|p=59}}}}

To these nondual traditions belong [[Hinduism]] (including [[Vedanta]], some forms of [[Yoga]], and certain schools of [[Shaivism]]), [[Taoism]], [[Pantheism]], [[Rastafari movement|Rastafari]] and similar systems of thought.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

[[Image:1898 kiwi 6d red.JPG|thumb|200px|A [[kiwi]] on an 1898 New Zealand stamp. The bird, which is a national icon of New Zealand, takes its name from the Māori language.]]

During the 19th century, [[New Zealand English]] gained many [[loanword]]s from the [[Māori language]], mainly the names of birds, plants, fishes and places, but the flow stopped abruptly around the beginning of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;According to New Zealand English specialist Elizabeth Gordon&lt;/ref&gt;{{Full citation needed|date=September 2018}}{{why|date=January 2013}} From the last quarter of the 20th century onwards this flow resumed, this time with a focus on cultural concepts. The use of Māori words is increasing{{when|date=July 2015}}, particularly in the North Island.{{why|date=January 2013}}{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

==Plants and animals==
Large numbers of native plants and animals retain their Māori names in New Zealand English. Examples include:

* Birds: [[Kakapo|kākāpō]], [[kea]], [[kererū]], [[kiwi]], [[kōkako]], [[moa]], [[Purple Swamphen|pūkeko]], [[takahē]], [[Tui (bird)|tūī]],
* Plants: [[kahikatea]], [[kānuka]], [[kauri]], [[Sweet potato|kūmara]], [[Leptospermum scoparium|mānuka]], [[Prumnopitys taxifolia|mataī]], [[Discaria toumatou|matakoura]], [[Metrosideros excelsa|pōhutukawa]], [[toetoe]], [[Podocarpus totara|tōtara]], [[tutu (plant)|tutu]]
* Fish: [[tarakihi]], [[hapuku]]

==Other terms==
"[[Kia ora]]" (literally "be healthy") is a Māori term of greeting, meaning "hello" or "welcome". It can also mean "thank you", or signify agreement with a speaker at a meeting. The Māori greetings "tēnā koe" (to one person), "tēnā kōrua" (to two people) or "tēnā koutou" (to three or more people) are also widely used, as are farewells such as "haere rā".

The Māori phrase "[[kia kaha]]", "be strong", is frequently encountered as an indication of moral support for someone starting a stressful undertaking or otherwise in a difficult situation. Although previously in common usage it became an iconic phrase of support following the [[2010 Canterbury earthquake]].

Some [[hybrid word]]s, part English and part Māori, have developed, the most common of which is probably ''half-pai'' &amp;mdash; often written ''half-pie'' &amp;mdash; meaning incomplete or substandard quality, ''pai'' being the Māori word for "good". (The portmanteau form ''half-pied'' is also used, derived from ''half-baked''.) Similarly, the Māori word ending ''-tanga'', which has a similar meaning to the English ending ''-ness'', is occasionally used in hybrid terms such as ''kiwitanga'' (that is, the state of being a New Zealander).

Several Māori words are used in English as lighthearted, or even slang, equivalents of their more common English counterparts. The term ''puku'' for stomach, for example, is more likely to be encountered during a friendly chat than in more formal circumstances, with one of its uses being a euphemism for a large belly.

English words intimately associated with New Zealand are often of Māori origin, such as [[haka]],&lt;ref name=OxfordDictionaries-haka-01a&gt;{{cite web|url= https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/haka |title=Definition of haka in English|work=British &amp; World English|publisher=Oxford Dictionaries|accessdate=15 November 2017 |quote=haka NOUN: A Maori ceremonial war dance involving chanting, an imitation of which is performed by New Zealand rugby teams before a match. ...

A history of Native American rhetorics.

==Timeline==
'''1823 - [[Johnson v. McIntosh]]'''&lt;br/&gt;
:Precedent-setting case between two white parties about property rights to land in America--no Native speaks, though Native interests are affected by the ruling.
'''1830s - [[William Apess|William Appess]]''' &lt;br/&gt;
:who delivers “An Indian’s Looking-Glass for the White Man” and Eulogy on King Philip&lt;br/&gt; in which he states, “And while you ask yourself, ‘What do they, the Indians, want?’ you have only to look at the unjust laws made for them and say, ‘They want what I want.’”
'''1827 and 1839 - Cherokee constitutions'''&lt;br/&gt;
'''1879 - [[Thomas Tibbles]]'''&lt;br/&gt;
:who arranges an East coast lecture tour for the Ponca leader, Standing Bear.
'''1879 - [[Sarah Winnemucca Hopkins]]'''&lt;br/&gt;
:who lectures to criticize Agency mistreatment of Paiutes.
'''1881 - Constitution of the [[Osage Nation]]'''&lt;br/&gt;
:The Osage constitutional democratic government is not recognized after 1898 by the U.S.; the cause is taken up again (with mixed results) throughout the twentieth century until it is finally ended in 1997. See Warrior, The People and the Word.
'''1881 – [[Helen Hunt Jackson]], A Century of Dishonor'''&lt;br/&gt;
:“The first pro-Indian book to make a significant impact on the American reading public” ( Frederick W. Turner, “The Century after ‘A Century of Dishonor:’”)
:An appeal to the heart and conscience of the American people for repairing broken treaties, theft, and institutional termination.
'''1928 – [[Meriam Report]]''' &lt;br/&gt;
:Institute for Government Research report that denounces the Dawes Act, and criticizes the BIA.
'''1946 - [[Indian Claims Commission]] created'''&lt;br/&gt;
'''1953 – [[Thomas Banyacya]]''' &lt;br/&gt;
:who writes a letter on behalf of the Hopi to President Dwight D. Eisenhower to request recognition for their claims for being conscientious objectors. Mr. Banyacya helped win an understanding with local Selective Service officials that any Hopi who requested classification as a conscientious objector would receive it.
'''1955 - [[Tee-Hit-Ton Indians v. United States]]'''&lt;br/&gt;
'''1961 - The American Indian Chicago Conference''' &lt;br/&gt;
:Ninety separate communities meet at the U Chicago to critique US termination policies, and draft the Declaration of Indian Purpose.
'''1966-1995 - Blackbird Bend litigation''' &lt;br/&gt;
:In a long and bitter series of legal battles, the Omaha nation seek to regain land along the edge of their reservation. They regain a small amount. See Scherer, Imperfect Victories.
'''1969 - Alcatraz Occupation''' &lt;br/&gt;
:Mobilized by ethnic studies programs at San Francisco State and UC Berkeley, Bay Area Indians allied with the [[American Indian Movement]] (AIM) occupy Alcatraz island, invoking the Fort Laramie treaty of 1868 for surplus federal land to claim it for a cultural center.
'''1970 - [[N. Scott Momaday]]''' &lt;br/&gt;
:who gives “Man Made of Words” keynote at the First Convocation of American Indian Scholars. See Warrior, The People and the Word.

:who publishes Halfbreed, the first book by a Native Canadian women since the death of Pauline Johnson in 1913.
'''1977 - Charles Aubid''' &lt;br/&gt;
:who testifies before US District Court Judge Miles Lord. Aubid appeals to use the memory of the deceased Old John Squirrel in a case about Anishinaabeg control of the annual wild rice harvest. (Vizenor, “Aesthetics of Survivance,” Survivance: Narratives of Native Presence).
'''1980 - [[Russell Means]] “Fighting Words on the Future of the Earth,” ''Mother Jones''''' &lt;br/&gt; 
:Means critiques Marxism and calls for Lakota tradition. Importantly, he does so through the writing of someone who has recorded his speech.
'''1994 - [[Gerald Vizenor]] ''Manifest Manners'''''&lt;br/&gt;
:Vizenor formulates the concept of cultural [[survivance]]--survival and resistance--to describe Native signification.

'''1997 - Robin Ridington and Dennis Hastings, ''Blessing for a Long Time'''''&lt;br/&gt;
:Ridington and Hastings write an ethnography of Umon’hon’ti, which involves them in the story of the subject they document. They work with the Omaha to return their sacred pole from the Harvard Peabody Museum.
'''1998 - “Statement of Reconciliation”''' &lt;br/&gt; 
:which Canada makes to its Native peoples, collected within Gathering Strength, Canada’s Aboriginal Action Plan.

:who is fired from Colorado University for allegations of plagiarism after publishing “"Some People Push Back": On the Justice of Roosting Chickens” (2001){{dubious|date=January 2013}}
'''2008 - Malea Powell, “Dreaming Charles Eastman: Cultural Memory, Autobiography, and Geography in Indigenous Rhetorical Histories”''' &lt;br/&gt;
:A short mixed-genre (narrative, theory, poetry) essay in which Powell grapples with being “an Indian talking about what it means to be an Indian engaged in the archive, what it means to be the object looking back, the objectified engaged in the process of making knowledge about the processes that led to my objectification” (117).

'''Opsis''' ({{lang-grc|ὄψις}}) is the Greek word for [[spectacle]] in the [[theatre]] and [[performance]]. Its first use has been traced back to [[Aristotle]]'s ''[[Poetics]].'' It is now taken up by theatre critics, historians, and theorists to describe the [[mise en scène]] of a performance or theatrical event.

==Origins==

Opsis comes from the [[ancient Greek]] for "appearance, sight, view."&lt;ref name=OED&gt;[http://dictionary.oed.com Oxford English Dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/morph?l=o%29%2Fyeis&amp;la=greek#lexicon ὄψις] entry in Liddell-Scott disctionary at the Perseus project&lt;/ref&gt; The English word [[optic]] is derived from this word.

==Aristotle and the Greeks==

Aristotle's use of the term opsis, as [[Marvin Carlson]] points out, is the "final element of tragedy," but the term "receive[d] no further consideration".&lt;ref name="Carlson"&gt;{{cite book | author = Carlson, Marvin | title = ''Theories of the Theatre: A Historical and Critical Survey from the Greeks to the Present'' | year = 1993 | isbn = 978-0-8014-8154-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aristotle discusses opsis in book 6 of the poetics,&lt;ref&gt;[http://kennydominican.joyeurs.com/GreekClassics/AristotlePoetics.htm Aristotle - Poetics], Translated by S. H. Butcher, with original Greek text&lt;/ref&gt; but only goes as far as to suggest that "spectacle has, indeed, an emotional attraction of its own, but, of all the parts, it is the least artistic, and connected least with the art of poetry. For the power of Tragedy, we may be sure, is felt even apart from representation and actors. Besides, the production of spectacular effects depends more on the art of the stage machinist than on that of the poet".&lt;ref name="Dukore"&gt;{{cite book | author = DUKORE, Bernard Frank | title = ''Dramatic theory and criticism: Greeks to Grotowski'' | year = 1974 | isbn = 978-0-03-091152-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contemporary theatre theory==
In ''Theories of the Theatre'' by Marvin Carlson, the word opsis is replaced with the English equivalent "spectacle," but gives opsis/spectacle as much focus as Aristotle does in the Poetics; however, in ''Dictionary of the Theatre: Terms, Concepts, and Analysis'' Opsis is listed in the "terms" section, and defined as:&lt;blockquote&gt;
that which is visible, offered to the [gaze], hence its connections with the notions of ''spectacle'' and ''performance''. In Aristotle's ''Poetics, spectacle'' is one of the six constituent parts of tragedy, but ranks below others considered to be more essential ... The place in theatre history assigned subsequently to the opsis, to what we would now call the [mise-en-scene], determined the mode of transmission and the overall meaning of the performance. ''Opsis'' is a spectific feature of the performing arts.&lt;ref name="Pavis"&gt;{{cite book | author = Pavis, Patrice, Christine Shantz, Marvin Carlson | title = ''Dictionary of the Theatre: Terms, Concepts, and Analysis'' | year = 1998 | isbn = 978-0-8020-8163-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

J. Michael Walton, in ''The Greek Sense of Theatre: Tragedy Reviewed'', challenges the traditional assumptions about Ancient Greek theatre. He states that “the visual aspect of the Greek theatre has for so long taken second place to the spoken word...it is still the common belief that what was said in the Greek tragedies was more important than what was seen.” Walton's thesis suggests that Ancient theatre lacks evidence of original productions, but that the written text, in comparison, is more accessible, and as a result, has caused Ancient theatre critics to relegate spectacle/mise-en-sene/opsis to less important aspects of theatre than the spoken word.

Ronald W. Vince, suggests that while it may &lt;blockquote&gt;
seem logical simply to recognize ''opsis'' as stage spectacle or the ''mise-en-scene'' and so include it — if anywhere — in the vocabulary of performance theory. But there is implied even in Aristotle's use of the term a possible interpretation which would link ''opsis'' with the art of writing plays as well as with the art of staging them.&lt;ref name="Vince"&gt;{{cite book | author = Vince | title = Opsis as a Term in Dramatic Theory | year = 1990 | journal = Assaph C, no 6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Power Without Responsibility''''' (subtitled: ''The Press and Broadcasting in Britain'' or ''Press, Broadcasting and the Internet in Britain'') is a book written by [[James Curran (media historian)|James Curran]] (Professor of Communications at [[Goldsmiths College]]) and [[Jean Seaton]] (Professor of Media History at the [[University of Westminster]]). Originally published in 1981 by [[HarperCollins|Fontana]], it has been translated into several languages and is now in its seventh edition. The title comes from a quote by former British Prime Minister [[Stanley Baldwin]]. It details the history of the news media in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] from the eighteenth century to the present. It has been cited by [[Noam Chomsky]] in the introduction to ''[[Manufacturing Consent]]'' and by him in a televised [[BBC]] interview with [[Andrew Marr]]. [[Nick Cohen]] rated it "the best guide to the British media" in a review for the ''[[New Statesman]]''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11188">'''PREservation Metadata: Implementation Strategies''' ('''PREMIS''') is an international working group concerned with developing metadata for use in digital preservation.

In 2003 the [[Online Computer Library Center]] (OCLC) and [[Research Libraries Group]] (RLG) established the PREMIS working group, which consisted of a multi-national roster of more than thirty representatives from the cultural, government, and private sectors, in order to define implementable, core [[preservation metadata]], with guidelines/recommendations for [[Metadata management|management]] and use.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title= PREMIS Preservation Metadata Maintenance Activity |publisher= US Library of Congress |url= https://www.loc.gov/standards/premis/ |accessdate= October 10, 2013 }} &lt;/ref&gt; 
PREMIS was “charged to define a set of semantic units that are implementation independent, practically oriented, and likely to be needed by most preservation repositories”.&lt;ref&gt;Caplan, P. &amp; Guenther, R. (2005). Practical preservation: The PREMIS experience. Library Trends, 54, (1), 111-124.&lt;/ref&gt; 

In May 2005, PREMIS released ''Data Dictionary for Preservation Metadata: Final Report of the PREMIS Working Group''. This 237-page report includes: PREMIS Data Dictionary 1.0: a comprehensive, practical resource for implementing preservation metadata in digital archiving systems; accompanying report (providing context, data model, assumptions); special topics, glossary, usage examples; set of [[XML schema]] which was developed to support use of the Data Dictionary.&lt;ref&gt;PREMIS Preservation Metadata Maintenance Activity(Library of Congress) https://www.loc.gov/standards/premis/&lt;/ref&gt; Version 2.0 of PREMIS was released in March 2008.&lt;ref&gt;PREMIS Editorial Committee. (2008). [https://www.loc.gov/premis/v2/premis-2-0.pdf PREMIS Data Dictionary for Preservation Metadata, Version 2.0.] URL accessed April 28, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Version 3.0 of PREMIS was released in June 2015.&lt;ref&gt;PREMIS Editorial Committee. (2015). [https://www.loc.gov/standards/premis/v3/premis-3-0-final.pdf PREMIS Data Dictionary for Preservation Metadata, Version 3.0.] URL accessed November 11, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Every digital object usually has metadata with descriptive information about the object connected to it.  Digital library professionals however are all too aware that metadata for access and discovery is no longer enough. These professionals are looking to the future with an eye towards preservation, not only of the digital objects themselves but its metadata as well. Consider that certain [[file format]]s can become obsolete and inaccessible by future applications. This would require either transforming older formats to new (migration), or reproducing the original experience with newer technology (emulation). Both strategies would require the following: technical metadata about the original files, the older hardware and software that they ran on, and what actions had been performed on them, all of which is preservation metadata. Preservation metadata therefore supports activities intended to ensure the long-term usability of a digital resource.&lt;ref&gt;Library of Congress. "PREMIS for Digital Preservation". http://www.digitalpreservation.gov/series/challenge/premis.html, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The PREMIS working group was created to further the work began by another initiative sponsored by the OCLC and the RLG: the Preservation Metadata Framework (PMF) working group. In 2001–2002 the PMF working group outlined the types of information that should be associated with an archived digital object. Their report, ''A Metadata Framework to Support the Preservation of Digital Objects'' (the ''Framework''), proposed a list of prototype metadata elements. At this stage these proposed elements could not be implemented and additional work was needed. The PREMIS working group was asked to take the PMF group’s findings a step further and develop a [[data dictionary]] of core metadata for archived digital objects, as well as give guidance and suggest best practice for creating, managing, and using the metadata in preservation systems.&lt;ref&gt;Library of Congress. "PREMIS Data Dictionary". https://www.loc.gov/standards/premis/v2/premis-2-0.pdf, p.2&lt;/ref&gt;  

In November 2003 the PREMIS working group sought to understand how preservation repositories were actually implementing preservation metadata. A survey was performed on 70 organizations thought to be active in or interested in digital preservation. In December 2004 the PREMIS working group published its report, ''Implementing Preservation Repositories for Digital Materials: Current Practice and Emerging Trends in the Cultural Heritage Community''. The findings were extremely helpful in the development of the Data Dictionary.&lt;ref&gt;''ibid''&lt;/ref&gt; 

The earlier ''Framework'' and the PREMIS Data Dictionary build on the [[Open Archival Information System]] (OAIS) reference model. The OAIS information model provides a conceptual foundation in the form of a taxonomy of information objects and packages for archived objects, and the structure of their associated metadata. The ''Framework'', through its deeply detailed mapping of preservation metadata to that conceptual structure, can be seen as an elaboration of OAIS. The PREMIS Data Dictionary, on the other hand, can be seen as a translation of the ''Framework'' into a set of implementable semantic units. It should be noted that the Data Dictionary and OAIS sometimes differ in terminology usage and these are noted in the Glossary. Differences usually reflect the fact that PREMIS semantic units require more specificity than the OAIS definitions provide, which is to be expected when moving from a [[conceptual framework]] to an implementation.&lt;ref&gt;Library of Congress. "PREMIS Data Dictionary". https://www.loc.gov/standards/premis/v2/premis-2-0.pdf, p.3&lt;/ref&gt;

==Entities==
The PREMIS data model consists of five interrelated entities: Intellectual, Object, Event, Agent, and Rights with each semantic unit in the data dictionary categorized in one of these areas.&lt;ref&gt;PREMIS Editorial Committee. (2008). [https://www.loc.gov/premis/v2/premis-2-0.pdf PREMIS Data Dictionary for Preservation Metadata, Version 2.0.], 5-6. URL accessed April 28, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''intellectual entity''' is a set of content that constitutes a discrete, coherent intellectual unit, such as a book or a database. These may be compound objects containing other intellectual entities and may have multiple digital representations.&lt;ref name="PREMIS Editorial Committee 2008"&gt;PREMIS Editorial Committee. (2008). [https://www.loc.gov/premis/v2/premis-2-0.pdf PREMIS Data Dictionary for Preservation Metadata, Version 2.0.], 6. URL accessed April 28, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Descriptive metadata is usually applied at this level; given the proliferation of competing schemes, the working group did not define any further descriptive semantic units&lt;ref&gt;PREMIS Editorial Committee. (2008). [https://www.loc.gov/premis/v2/premis-2-0.pdf PREMIS Data Dictionary for Preservation Metadata, Version 2.0.], 23-4. URL accessed April 28, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; and allowed for interoperability through “extension containers” (containers hold a related group of semantic units) that can be used for external schemes.&lt;ref name="PREMIS Editorial Committee 2008"/&gt;

Most of the semantic units listed in the data dictionary relate to '''object''' and '''event entities''', the former being further divided into three subtypes of '''file''', '''bitstream''', and '''representation'''. A '''file''' is the level at which most end users are used to working, a “named and ordered sequence of bytes that is known by an operating system.” It includes a variety of file system attributes, rendering it understandable by an operating system, encompassing '''bitstreams''', which are “contiguous or non-contiguous data within a file that has meaningful common properties for preservation purposes.”  A '''representation''' is, in a sense, the “highest level” of this model, for it may encompass several files in order to properly render the structure and content of an intellectual entity.  Not all repositories will be concerned with preserving representations,&lt;ref&gt;PREMIS Editorial Committee. (2008). [https://www.loc.gov/premis/v2/premis-2-0.pdf PREMIS Data Dictionary for Preservation Metadata, Version 2.0.], 7-8. URL accessed April 28, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; depending on their purpose and the curatorial body’s need to preserve what might be considered the entity’s digital “intrinsic value.” Furthermore, intellectual entities may have multiple representations within a repository. '''Events''' interrelate with objects insofar as they involve actions that have an effect on them or '''agents''' ("a person, organization, or software...associated with Events...or with Rights attached to an object") associated with the object.&lt;ref name="PREMIS Editorial Committee 2008"/&gt;

Finally, the inclusion of '''rights''' entities responds to an increased awareness of and concern for the legal requirements of copyright and licensing. It also includes information about the specific actions permitted; for example, semantic unit 4.1.6.1, act, “the action the preservation repository is allowed to take,” includes such suggested values as replicate, migrate, and delete.&lt;ref&gt;PREMIS Editorial Committee. (2008). [https://www.loc.gov/premis/v2/premis-2-0.pdf PREMIS Data Dictionary for Preservation Metadata, Version 2.0.], 6, 181. URL accessed April 28, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Data dictionary==
PREMIS data dictionary entries include twelve attribute fields, not all of which are applied to every semantic unit (analogous to an "element" in other metadata schemes). In addition to the name and definition of the unit, the fields record such things as rationale for including the unit, usage notes, and examples of how the value might be filled in. Four of the attributes - object category, applicability, repeatability, and obligation - are linked, as the last three are defined for each of the object entity levels of file, bitstream, and representation. The dictionary is hierarchical; some semantic units are contained within others.  For example, 1.3 preservationLevel, includes four semantic components, such as 1.3.1 preservationLevelValue and 1.3.2 preservationLevelRole.&lt;ref&gt;PREMIS Editorial Committee. (2008). [https://www.loc.gov/premis/v2/premis-2-0.pdf PREMIS Data Dictionary for Preservation Metadata, Version 2.0.], 22-194. URL accessed April 28, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sholapith''' or '''Shola Pith''' (also referred to as '''shola''' and '''Indian cork''') is a dried milky-white spongey plant matter from ''[[Aeschynomene]]'' sp. It can be pressed and shaped into  objects of art.&lt;ref name=govt&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.murshidabad.gov.in/About.aspx#4 |title = Handicrafts &amp; Silk Industry  |accessdate = 2009-05-04|last =   |first =    |work = Indian Cork (Sholapith) |publisher =Murshidabad district authority}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== ''Aeschynomene'' ==
[[File:A piece of Aeschynomene sp. stem, close-up photo.jpg|thumb|A piece of Aeschynomene sp stem. The very thin, reddish brown layer around the stem, is the bark. The whitish interior is the wood. The central, dark hollow tube contained the pith which disappeared with the ageing of the plant.]]
The useful part of this plant is the bark of the wood (secondary-xylem) of the stem. This wood is often mistaken as the pith.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tropical.theferns.info/viewtropical.php?id=Aeschynomene+indica|title=Aeschynomene indica - Useful Tropical Plants|website=tropical.theferns.info}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Aeschynomene'' makes among the world's lightest woods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mortensen|first=Andreas|title=Concise Encyclopedia of Composite Materials|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=zs_lGeGsuaAC|page=888}}|date=8 December 2006|publisher=Elsevier|isbn=978-0-08-052462-7|pages=888–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shola grows wild in marshy waterlogged areas. The biological name of shola is &lt;!-- is this certain?''[[Aeschynomene indica]]'' or--&gt;''[[Aeschynomene aspera]]'' of the [[bean]] family. It is an herbaceous plant, which grows especially in the marshy areas of [[Bengal]], [[Assam]], [[Orissa, India|Orissa]] and [[Deccan Plateau|the Deccan]]. The sholapith is the cortex or core of the plant and is about 1.5 inch across.&lt;ref name=govt/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;india-crafts.com&lt;/ref&gt;

== Crafts ==
Traditionally sholapith products have been used for decorating Hindu idols and creating the [[Topor (headgear)|headgear]] of brides and grooms for a traditional [[Bengali Hindu wedding|Bengali wedding]]. In more recent times, sholapith handicrafts have found a wider application in home décor such as Hindu gods and artistic objects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url =http://www.zimbio.com/Asian+Home+Decor/articles/34/Shola+craft+Bengal+Magic+soft+reed |title = Shola-pith |accessdate = 2009-05-04|last =   |first =    |work =  |publisher =zimbio.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sholapith is similar in form to man-made  [[Polystyrene#Foams|polystyrene foam]] (sometimes known by the brand names Thermacol and Styrofoam), but is superior in terms of malleability, texture, [[wikt:lustre|lustre]] and sponginess.&lt;ref name=govt/&gt;

==West Bengal==
In [[West Bengal]], this craft is mainly practised in the districts of [[Bardhaman district|Bardhaman]], [[Murshidabad district|Murshidabad]], [[Birbhum district|Birbhum]], [[Nadia district|Nadia]], [[Hooghly district|Hooghly]], [[Malda district|Malda]] and south 24 Parganas district. Sholapith craftsmen are known as ''Malakar'', meaning "garland maker", probably because they made shola garlands for idols and for the noble class.

About 5,000 artisans practice this craft. Craftsmen spend months on each piece.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aboutbengal.com/2009/02/shola_pith_craft_west_bengal/ |title=Shola pith craft of West Bengal |accessdate=2009-05-04 |last= |first= |work= |publisher=aboutbengal.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131208003607/http://www.aboutbengal.com/2009/02/shola_pith_craft_west_bengal |archivedate=December 8, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Murshidabad]] shola crafts are flowery designs, decorative headwear of gods and goddesses, garlands, figurines such as the faces of gods and goddesses, elephant [[howdah]]s, peacock boats and [[Litter (vehicle)|palanquins]].&lt;ref name=govt/&gt; Shola products are exported to across the world. In [[South 24 Parganas]], many poor families earn their livelihood from shola products. Big [[Puja (Hinduism)|''puj''a]] ''pandels'' of Calcutta are beautifully decorated using shola. 

The idol makers of [[Kumortuli]] who traditionally produced clay idols have taken to making idols of sholapith and [[Fiberglass|fibreglass]]. While fibreglass products can cost around Rs 110,000-120,000, those prepared from sholapith cost Rs 90,000. The height of the idols can vary from four to nine feet. These are mostly purchased for Indian community [[Puja (Hinduism)|puja]] organizers abroad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url = http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/Cities/Kolkata_/Idol_demand_grows_abroad/articleshow/3551285.cms |title = Idol demand grows abroad |accessdate = 2009-05-04|last =   |first =    |work =  |publisher =''Times of India'', 2 October 2009 |date=2008-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Pith helmet ==
[[File:Aden Pattern Pith Helmet.jpg|thumb|left|An "Aden" or "Cawnpore" style of pith helmet. They were manufactured in India until about 1938.]]
The shola (sola)-style [[pith helmet]]—also known as the sun helmet, topee, shola topee, salacot or topi, is a lightweight helmet made of shola pith, with a cloth cover and a particular design and thickness designed to shade and insulate the wearer’s head from the sun. It was popular among Westerners in India, Pakistan, Egypt, Sudan, Iraq, Transjordan, Palestine, Sri Lanka, and other tropical and subtropical British colonies until the late 1960s.
 
Later this style of hat became associated with colonial oppression and was slowly abandoned by Western visitors, but continues to be used by military units around the world. The Shola-style helmet has, however, recently gained popularity among traffic police in cities such as [[Chennai]] during the summer as they insulate the wearer from the oppressive South Asian summer heat.

[[File:Shola Pith Helmet.jpg|thumb|An Indian made 'Bombay Bowler' shola style pith helmet from the WW II era.]]
The Shola-style [[pith helmet]] usually has a flattened top and thick brim with either square or rounded edges. It is easily confused with other styles of "[[pith helmets]]" that were manufactured outside India and are usually made from [[Cork (material)|cork]] or other materials. Some shola-style pith helmets feature a crisscross quilt-stitched cloth cover. The latter had more rounded edges at the brim. The cork-style pith helmets, contrary to their misleading name, are not made out of pith; they are much thinner, heavier, and more rounded on the top.

Both styles of hats feature [[wikt:puggree|puggree]]s, air vents, [[khaki]] or white covers and green inner brim liners. Some have chin straps made of leather, in others they are made of cloth. Some Shola-style [[pith helmet]]s feature a thin leather belt that runs from under the puggaree across the top. The chin strap commonly runs across the front brim. Shola pith helmets are still sold in Indian, Pakistani and Nepali [[polo]]-equipment stores, though they are seldom used in matches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hotnewsitems.blogspot.com//2007/11/pith-helment-coming-back-in-style.html|title=Case Study Blog|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Soupy Norman''''' is an eight-part Irish television programme broadcast by [[RTÉ]]. It aired weekly on Thursday nights at 23:05 on the [[RTÉ Two]] channel, in ten-minute segments. The series ran from May 2007 to December 2008. The show is a comedic re-dubbing of the Polish soap opera ''[[Pierwsza miłość]]'' (''First Love''), which has been running on [[Polsat]] television since 2004.

The series is written and edited by [[Barry Murphy (comedian)|Barry Murphy]] and Mark Doherty, with additional voices provided by [[Tara Flynn]], Sue Collins, Luke Murphy and [[Mario Rosenstock]]. Where the original soap opera dealt with a girl leaving her family behind to go to college, the re-dubbed version of the programme explores the [[culture shock]] of a dysfunctional [[County Cork|Cork]] family in [[Dublin]]. The series' [[surreal humour]] led to a [[cult following]], with its episodes being popular on YouTube.

A special episode entitled "The Late Late Soupy Norman Tribute" which featured dubbed clips from [[RTÉ]]'s ''[[The Late Late Show (Ireland)|The Late Late Show]]'' as well as clips from previous episodes of ''Soupy Norman'' as well as including a new scene of the show. This was broadcast on Christmas Eve 2007.

A pilot sketch for the series initially aired on [[Armando Iannucci]]'s show ''[[Time Trumpet]]'' on [[BBC 2]], of which this show was a spin-off.

==Plot==
The main story of the show concerns Esther, a young girl from [[Buttevant]], [[County Cork]], who travels up to [[Dublin (city)|Dublin]] to study in college. There she encounters strong discrimination, for being a "[[culchie]]". She lives with Susan Costigan (or Gleeson, depending on the episode), described by Esther as "a woman with red hair", her daughter Kylie, her son Nathan (who becomes possessed by voices in the episode "Omen"), and her husband Declan. Kylie becomes Esther's friend, and they are seen stealing items (such as a dog) in the episode "Margarita".

The series' other main characters are Esther's father, named Jack, and her Grandad, known to Jack as "Daddy", who live in [[Buttevant]]. She has a sister, who is unseen throughout the series, who Jack mentions a few times ("I have two daughters – two of them – and one of them's a boy"). Grandad is an extreme [[authority figure]], as seen in the first episode "Buttevant", often sending Jack to the "bold chair" if he disobeys him in any way. He constantly berates Jack, calling him a "great big disappointment". The two of them are mostly seen drinking vinegar (Jack thinking it was [[whisky]]), and being visited by Soupy Norman, the title character.

Soupy is always extremely aggressive and [[inebriated]], and is only ever seen stumbling into the pair's house, delivering rambling, nonsensical rantings to the two men, always trying to punch Jack. In one episode, he asks to marry Esther's sister. He refers to Esther as "that culchie bitch". The Soupy Norman sequences are always taken from the same scene from ''First Love'', and are repeated every episode.

The series has a subplot of Sean, a [[Dublin]] youth, trying to make a living in the city. He does this by applying for increasingly strange jobs, such as a [[Construction worker|builder]], walking a dog with "canine leg disorder", running the "Red Car Bar" nightclub, and helping Satanic spirits in the episode "Omen" (a reference to the film ''[[The Omen]]''.)

In the final episode, "Straz", a character called Soupy Dave (who is sometimes seen throughout the series trying to sell Jack and Grandad shady goods such as [[prawn]]s and whale meat) is contracted by Jack's estranged wife (rarely seen before this episode) to kill him, using a number of surreal techniques.

The '''State Palaces, Castles and Gardens of Saxony''' ({{lang-de|Staatliche Schlösser, Burgen und Gärten Sachsen}}) is a state-owned company with its head office in [[Dresden]]. It belongs to the Saxon State Ministry of Finance and has the aim of preserving Saxon cultural heritage whilst respecting [[culture|cultural]] and [[architectural conservation|conservation]] needs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.schloesserland-sachsen.de/cms/fileadmin/user_upload/bilder/Satzung_SSBG.pdf/ Satzung (pdf)]&lt;/ref&gt; The state-owned company manages several palaces, castles and parks in the [[Saxony]]. These include the [[Zwinger (Dresden)|Zwinger]] in [[Dresden]], the [[Albrechtsburg]] in [[Meissen]] and [[Kriebstein Castle]].

== History ==
Following the restoration of the [[Free State of Saxony]] on 3 October 1990, assets that had already been owned in the past by the state, or which had been managed during the East German era as legal entities under the Asset Allocation Act, were transferred into the ownership of the new German state.

Starting on the first of January 1992, the state took over the following properties: [[Dresden Castle]] including the [[Johanneum (Dresden)|Johanneum]] and the [[Stallhof (Dresden)|Stallhof]], the Dresden [[Zwinger (Dresden)|Zwinger]] and the Zwinger Gardens, the [[Japanese Palace]] with its palace garden, [[Pillnitz Castle|Pillnitz Castle and park]], [[Schloss Moritzburg|Moritzburg Palace]] and the surrounding landscape gardens, the [[Albrechtsburg|Albrechtsburg in Meißen]], [[Königstein Fortress]], [[Schloss Weesenstein]], [[Gnandstein Castle]], [[Frauenstein Castle (Ore Mountains)|Frauenstein castle ruins]], [[Großsedlitz Baroque Gardens]], [[Hubertusburg|Hubertusburg Palace]], [[Nischwitz Palace]], [[Burg Stolpen|Stolpen Castle]], [[Augustusburg Hunting Lodge|Augustusburg Palace]], [[Lichtenwalde Palace]], the [[Muskau Park|palace and park at Bad Muskau]], [[Colditz Castle]], [[Altzella Abbey]], [[Nossen Palace]], [[Pegau#Wiederau Palace|Wiederau Palace]], [[Mildenstein Castle]] and the [[Ortenburg (Bautzen)|Ortenburg]]&lt;ref&gt;Drucksache des Sächsischen Landtages 1/907&lt;/ref&gt;

In the following years, other historic buildings were allocated to the Free State of Saxony.

With a cabinet decision on third November 1992, 17 independent state companies were formed for some of the most important sites and placed under commercial management. These companies together formed the State Palaces Department (''Staatliche Schlösserverwaltung''). During the implementation phase, between 1 April 1993 and 1 January 1994, 15 state-owned enterprises were founded for the following properties:&lt;ref name="2/10146"&gt;Drucksache des Sächsischen Landtages 2/10146&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1 April 1993: the Albrechtsburg at Meißen, Augustusburg Palace, Scharfenstein Castle, Königstein Fortress, Moritzburg Palace
* 1 June 1993: Großsedlitz Baroque Gardens, Gnandstein Castle, Kriebstein Castle, Mildenstein Castle, Rammenau Palace, Stolpen Castle, Weesenstein Palace
* 1 August 1993: Dresden State Palaces and Gardens (''Staatliche Schlösser und Gärten Dresden'') (Pillnitz Palace and park, the Großer Garten, the Brühlsche Terrasse/Zwinger/Stallhof), Nossen Palace/Altzella Abbey Park
* 1 January 1994: Rochlitz Palace

In addition, the Palaces Department managed the following properties directly: the [[Albertinum (Dresden)|Albertinum]], the [[Catholic Church of the Royal Court of Saxony|Catholic Court Church]], the [[Jägerhof (Dresden)|Jägerhof]], the [[Freiberg Cathedral#Chancel and Royal Burial Chapel of the Albertines|Royal Burial Chapel at Freiberg]], [[Colditz Castle]], [[Lichtenwalde Palace]] and the [[Art Gallery in the Lipsius building|Exhibition Hall of the Academy of Art]].&lt;ref name="2/10146" /&gt;

The following properties remained under the administration of local authority land offices: the [[Japanese Palace]], [[Siebeneichen Palace]], [[Reinhardtsgrimma Palace]], the [[Ortenburg (Bautzen)|Ortenburg]], [[Hubertusburg|Hubertusburg Palace]], [[Freudenstein Castle]], [[Wurzen Palace]], [[Grimma Palace]] [[Königswartha#Palace and park|Königswartha Palace]], [[Suchominsky Villa]],  [[Sonnenstein Castle]], [[Dippoldiswalde Palace]], the [[Lauterstein Castle (Marienberg)|Niederlauterstein castle ruins]], the [[Frauenstein Castle (Ore Mountains)|Frauenstein castle ruins]], [[Wachwitz Palace]], the [[Wachwitz Palace|Royal Villa]],  [[Lützschena Palace]], [[Thallwitz Palace]], the [[Grillenburg Hunting Lodge]], [[Brauna Palace]], the [[Keppschloss]], [[Schieritz Palace|Zehren-Schieritz Palace]], [[Königsbrück Palace]], [[Gaussig House]], [[Hohenprießnitz Palace]] and [[Ruhenthal Palace]].&lt;ref name="2/10146" /&gt; Many of these sites were later transferred to the towns and cities in which they were situated or sold off to third parties.

On 1 March 1996 the Saxon Palaces Department was incorporated into the State Finance Office. On 1 July 2000 the companies running Königstein Fortress on the one hand and the castles of Augustusburg, Lichtenwalde, and Scharfenstein on the other hand were turned in a charitable company. Their owner remains the Free State of Saxony. The management of those involved is carried out by the Palaces Department.

In the period from 1993 to 2003 the Palaces Department's share of the cost rose from 37% to 61.4%. As of 1 January 2003, the Palaces Department was separate from the State Office and a common public enterprise, the "State Palaces, Castles and Gardens of Saxony", was founded. The palace companies are its individual business units.&lt;ref&gt;Drucksache des Sächsischen Landtages 3/8236&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publications==

===Books===
Stryker's first book, ''Gay by the Bay: A History of Queer Culture in the San Francisco Bay Area'' ([[Chronicle Books]] 1996), coauthored with Jim Van Buskirk, is an illustrated account of the evolution of [[LGBT culture]] in the [[San Francisco Bay Area]] of [[Northern California]]. This book and its successor, ''Queer Pulp'', were each nominated for a [[Lambda Literary Award]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Somatechnics: Queering the Technologisation of Bodies |editor1-last=Sullivan |editor1-first=Nikki |editor2-last=Murray |editor2-first=Samantha |year=2009 |publisher=[[Ashgate Publishing]] |location=[[Farnham]] |isbn=978-0-7546-7530-3 |oclc=319247423 |page=viii |accessdate=5 September 2012 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=o0VgREUE1dwC&amp;pg=PR8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Literary criticism|critical]] survey ''Queer Pulp: Perverted Passions from the Golden Age of the Paperback'' (Chronicle Books 2001), Stryker turned her attention to the [[lesbian pulp fiction]] and [[gay male pulp fiction]] published in the United States from the 1930s through the 1960s.

With [[Stephen Whittle]] she co-edited ''The Transgender Studies Reader'' ([[Routledge]] 2006), which was her first work to win a Lambda Literary Award. Her following book, ''[[Transgender History (book)|Transgender History]]'' ([[Seal Press]] 2008), covers [[transvestism]], transgender people, and [[transsexualism]] in the United States from the conclusion of World War II to the 2000s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Roth |first1=Benita |year=2010 |title=Book Reviews: ''Transgender History'' |journal=[[Signs (journal)|Signs]] |issue=Spring |pages=762–5 |publisher=[[University of Chicago Press]] |doi= |url=http://repository.upenn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1240&amp;context=asc_papers |accessdate=4 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kornstein |first1=Harris |year=2008 |title=Trans Activism |journal=[[Left Turn]] |volume= |issue=October/November |page= |doi= |url=http://www.leftturn.org/trans-activism |accessdate=4 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Tebbutt |first1=Clare |title=Book Review: ''Transgender History'' |journal=[[Women's History Review]] |volume= |issue= |pages= |publisher=[[Taylor &amp; Francis]] |doi=10.1080/09612025.2011.643006 |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kelly |first=Reese C. |year=2009 |title=Moving Across and Beyond Boundaries |journal=[[GLQ: A Journal of Lesbian and Gay Studies]] |volume=15 |issue=4 |pages=646–8 |publisher=[[Duke University Press]] |doi=10.1215/10642684-2009-007 |url=http://glq.dukejournals.org/content/4/2/145.citation |accessdate=11 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stryker is now working on a new book project, ''Cross-Dressing for Empire: Gender and Performance at the Bohemian Grove''. The [[Bohemian Grove]] is a campground in Northern California, and the summer meeting-place of the [[Bohemian Club]], a private organization of American men with considerable political and economic power or cultural influence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=No retreat from uproar over Bohemian Club woods |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2009/07/06/MNUU18ICIV.DTL |date=July 6, 2009 |work=[[San Francisco Chronicle]] |publisher= |accessdate=14 July 2009 | first=Jane | last=Kay}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bohemian Club.

===Film and video===
Stryker received a [[San Francisco / Northern California Emmy Award]] for her directorial work on ''Screaming Queens: The Riot at Compton's Cafeteria'' (2005),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Pomona College Professor Wins Northern California Emmy Award; Documentary ''Screaming Queens'' to Air Nationally on PBS in June |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-146160107.html |newspaper= |date=24 May 2006 |agency=AScribe Law News Service |accessdate=4 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; a documentary film about the [[Gene Compton's Cafeteria riot]] of 1966; the film was co-written, -directed, and -produced by Victor Silverman. With director Michelle Lawler and executive producer Kim Klausner she subsequently co-produced ''Forever's Gonna Start Tonight'' (2009), a documentary film about Vicki Marlane, an [[HIV-positive people|HIV-positive]], transgender performer at nightclubs and lounges. Stryker's most recent documentary is ''Christine in the Cutting Room'' (2013), an [[experimental film]] about [[Christine Jorgensen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=''Christine in the Cutting Room'' (work in progress)|url=http://ticketing.frameline.org/festival/film/detail.aspx?id=2741&amp;FID=49|publisher=Frameline|accessdate=4 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Monika Treut]] filmed and interviewed Stryker for the 1999 documentary film ''[[Gendernauts|Gendernauts: A Journey Through Shifting Identities]]''. She was also interviewed for a 2002 episode of the long-running television documentary series ''[[SexTV]]'', and for two episodes of ''[[Sex: The Revolution]]'' (2008). She is featured in the documentary film ''[[Reel in the Closet]]'' (2015), directed by Stu Maddux.

===Articles, essays, and scholarly papers===

Stryker and [[Paisley Currah]] co-edit ''[[TSQ: Transgender Studies Quarterly]]'', the first non-medical [[academic journal]] devoted to transgender issues.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.advocate.com/politics/transgender/2014/05/27/duke-univ-press-debuts-academic-journal-transgender-studies&lt;/ref&gt; The journal premiered in 2014.

In one paper, "Transgender Studies: Queer Theory's Evil Twin" (2004), Stryker describes how transgender people are often marginalized within the queer community, and how the academic discipline of Queer Studies privileges specific narratives of [[sexual orientation]] over [[gender identity]].&lt;ref name="eviltwin"/&gt;

The '''Taíno''' were an [[indigenous people of the Caribbean]]. At the time of European contact in the late fifteenth century, they were the principal inhabitants of most of [[Cuba]], [[Hispaniola]] (the [[Dominican Republic]] and [[Haiti]]), [[Jamaica]], [[Puerto Rico]], [[The Bahamas]] and the northern [[Lesser Antilles]]. The Taíno were the first New World peoples to encounter Europeans, during the [[Voyages of Christopher Columbus|voyages]] of [[Christopher Columbus]], starting in 1492. They spoke the [[Taíno language]], an [[Arawakan language]].&lt;ref name=Britannica&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title= Taino|encyclopedia= Encyclopædia Britannica|year=2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ancestors of the Taíno originated in South America, and the Taíno culture as documented developed in the Caribbean. Taíno groups were in conflict with the [[Island Caribs]] of the southern Lesser Antilles. At the time of contact, the Taíno were divided into several groups. Western Taíno groups included the [[Lucayans]] of the Bahamas, the [[Ciboney]] of central Cuba, and the inhabitants of Jamaica. The Classic Taíno lived in Hispaniola and Puerto Rico, while the Eastern Taíno lived in the northern islands of the Lesser Antilles.

At the time of [[Christopher Columbus|Columbus]]'s arrival in 1492, there were five Taíno [[chiefdom]]s in Hispaniola, each led by a principal {{lang|tnq|[[Cacique]]}} ([[tribal chief|chief]]), to whom tribute was paid. The Taíno name for Hispaniola was {{lang|tnq|Ayiti}} ("land of high mountains"), which is the source of the name ''Haiti''. Cuba was divided into 29 chiefdoms, many of which have given their name to modern cities, including [[Havana]], [[Batabanó, Cuba|Batabanó]], [[Camagüey]], [[Baracoa]], and [[Bayamo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PEE9oipDYksC&amp;pg=PA25|title=Art and Archaeology of Pre-Columbian Cuba|first1=Ramon Dacal|last1=Moure|first2=Manuel Rivero De La|last2=Calle|date=15 February 1997|publisher=University of Pittsburgh Pre|accessdate=19 May 2018|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; Taíno communities ranged from small settlements to larger centers of up to 3,000 people. They may have numbered 2 million at the time of contact.&lt;ref name=Britannica/&gt;

The Spanish conquered various Taíno chiefdoms during the late fifteenth and early sixteenth century. [[War]]fare and harsh enslavement by the colonists decimated the population.{{sfn|Chrisp|2006|p=34}} European diseases also played a major role; a [[smallpox]] epidemic in Hispaniola in 1518-1519 killed almost 90% of the surviving Taíno.{{sfn|Abbot|2010}}&lt;ref&gt;Alfred W. Crosby, ''The Columbian Exchange'' Westport, 1972, p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt; The remaining Taíno were intermarried with Europeans and Africans, and were incorporated into the Spanish colonies. The Taíno were considered extinct by the end of the century. However, since about 1840, there have been attempts to create a quasi-indigenous Taíno identity in rural areas of Cuba, the Dominican Republic, and Puerto Rico. This trend accelerated among Puerto Rican communities in the mainland United States in the 1960s.&lt;ref name=Aikhenvald&gt;Alexandra Aikhenvald (2012) ''Languages of the Amazon'', Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt; At the 2010 U.S. census, 1,098 people in Puerto Rico identified themselves as "Puerto Rican Indian", 1,410 identified as "Spanish American Indian", and 9,399 identified as "Taíno." In total, 35,856 Puerto Ricans considered themselves Native American.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/population/www/cen2010/cph-t/cph-t-6.html|title=American Indian and Alaska Native Tribes in the United States and Puerto Rico: 2010 (CPH-T-6)|last=|first=|date=2010|website=Census.gov|publisher=Census bureau|access-date=September 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A direct translation of the word "Taíno" signified "men of the good".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Rethinking Columbus - The Taínos: "Men of the Good"|last=Barreiro|first=José|publisher=Rethinking Schools, Ltd.|year=1998|isbn=978-0-942961-20-1|location=Milwaukee, Wisconsin|pages=106}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the name was used by the indigenous people of Hispaniola to indicate that they were "relatives".&lt;ref&gt;Alegría, "Taínos" vol. 1, p. 345.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Taíno people, or Taíno culture, has been classified by some authorities as belonging to the Arawak, as their language was considered to belong to the Arawak language family, the languages of which were present throughout the Caribbean, and much of Central and South America.
The early ethnohistorian [[Daniel Garrison Brinton]] called the Taíno people the "Island Arawak".&lt;ref name="DGB1871"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://archive.org/details/arawacklanguageo00brinrich |author= Daniel Garrison Brinton |date=1871 |title=The Arawack language of Guiana in its linguistic and ethnological relations |accessdate=22 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Nevertheless, contemporary scholars have recognized that the Taíno had developed a distinct language and culture.

Taíno and Arawak appellations have been used with numerous and contradictory meanings by writers, travelers, historians, linguists, and anthropologists. Often they were used interchangeably; "Taíno" has been applied to the Greater Antillean nation only, or including the Bahamian nations, or adding the [[Leeward Islands]] nations, or all those excluding the Puerto Rican and Leeward nations. Similarly, "Island Taíno" has been used to refer to those living in the [[Windward Islands]] only, to the northern Caribbean inhabitants only, as well as to the population of the entire Caribbean.

Modern historians, linguists and anthropologists now hold that the term Taíno should refer to all the Taíno/Arawak nations except for the [[Island Caribs|Caribs]], who are not seen to belong to the same people. Linguists continue to debate whether the Carib language is an Arawakan [[dialect]] or [[creole language]], or perhaps an individual language, with an Arawakan [[pidgin]] used for communication purposes.

Rouse classifies as Taíno all inhabitants of the Greater Antilles (except the western tip of Cuba), the Bahamian [[archipelago]], and the northern Lesser Antilles. He subdivides the Taíno into three main groups: Classic Taíno, mostly from Haiti, Puerto Rico, and the Dominican Republic; Western Taíno, or sub-Taíno, for population from Jamaica, Cuba (except for the western tip), and the Bahamian archipelago; and Eastern Taíno for those from the [[Virgin Islands]] to [[Montserrat]].{{sfn|Rouse|1992|p=7}}

==Origins==
[[File:Taínos.svg|right|thumb|The Guanahatabey region in relation to Taíno and [[Island Carib]] groups]]
Two schools of thought have emerged regarding the origin of the indigenous people of the Caribbean.

* One group of scholars contends that the ancestors of the Taíno came from the center of the [[Amazon Basin]], and are related to the [[Yanomama]]. This is indicated by linguistic, cultural and ceramic evidence. They migrated to the [[Orinoco]] valley on the north coast. From there they reached the Caribbean by way of what is now [[Guyana]] and [[Venezuela]] into [[Trinidad]], proceeding along the Lesser Antilles to Cuba and the Bahamian archipelago. Evidence that supports this theory includes the tracing of the ancestral cultures of these people to the Orinoco Valley and their languages to the Amazon Basin.&lt;ref name=Origins&gt;Rouse, pp. 30–48.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="native"&gt;{{cite journal | date = Aug 2001 | title = Mitochondrial DNA analysis reveals substantial Native American ancestry in Puerto Rico | url = | journal = Hum.

* The alternate theory, known as the circum-Caribbean theory, contends that the ancestors of the Taíno diffused from the [[Andean Region of Colombia|Colombian Andes]]. [[Julian H. Steward]], who originated this concept, suggests a migration from the Andes to the Caribbean and a parallel migration into [[Central America]] and into the [[Guianas]], Venezuela, and the Amazon Basin of South America.&lt;ref name=Origins/&gt;

Taíno culture as documented is believed to have developed in the Caribbean. The Taíno creation story says that they emerged from caves in a sacred mountain on present-day Hispaniola.&lt;ref&gt;Rouse, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; In Puerto Rico, 21st century studies have shown a high proportion of people having [[Amerindian]] [[MtDNA]]. Of the two major [[haplotypes]] found, one does not exist in the Taíno ancestral group, so other Native American people are also part of this genetic ancestry.&lt;ref name="native"/&gt;

==Culture==
[[File:Duho.jpg|thumb|right|''Dujo'', a wooden ceremonial chair crafted by Taínos]]
Taíno society was divided into two classes: ''naborias'' (commoners) and ''nitaínos'' (nobles). These were governed by male chiefs known as ''[[cacique]]s'', who inherited their position through their mother's noble line. The nitaínos functioned as sub-caciques in villages, overseeing naborias work. Caciques were advised by priests/healers known as ''bohiques''. Caciques enjoyed the privilege of wearing golden pendants called ''guanín'', living in square ''bohíos,'' instead of the round ones of ordinary villagers, and sitting on wooden stools to be above the guests they received.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.elmuseo.org/taino/caciques.html |title=Caciques, nobles and their regalia |accessdate=2006-11-09 |work= |publisher=elmuseo.org |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061009090513/http://elmuseo.org/taino/caciques.html  |archivedate = 2006-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bohiques were extolled for their healing powers and ability to speak with deities. They were consulted and granted the Taíno permission to engage in important tasks.

The Taíno had a [[matrilineal]] system of [[kinship]], descent, and inheritance. When a male heir was not present, the inheritance or succession would go to the oldest male child of the sister of the deceased. The Taíno had [[Avunculism|avunculocal]] post-marital residence, meaning a newly married couple lived in the household of the maternal uncle. He was more important in the lives of his niece's children than their biological father; the uncle introduced the boys to men's societies. Some Taíno practiced [[polygamy]]. Men, and sometimes women, might have two or three spouses. A few caciques had as many as 30 wives.

The Taíno women were highly skilled in agriculture. The people depended on it, but the men also fished and hunted. They made fishing nets and ropes from [[cotton]] and [[Palm tree|palm]]. Their dugout [[canoe]]s (''kanoa'') were made in various sizes, which could hold from 2 to 150 people. An average-sized canoe would hold about 15–20 people. They used bows and arrows for hunting, and developed the use of poisons on their arrowheads.

A frequently worn hair style for women featured bangs in front and longer hair in back. They sometimes wore gold jewelry, paint, and/or shells. Taíno men and unmarried women were usually naked. After marriage, women wore a small cotton apron, called a ''nagua''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Beding|editor1-first=Silvio|title=The Christopher Columbus Encyclopedia|date=1002|publisher=Palgrave MacMillan|isbn=978-1-349-12573-9|page=346|edition=ebook|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=gmmMCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA346&amp;dq=Ta%C3%ADno+sometimes+wore+nothing%7Cnaked&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjFk9z24JzTAhUJC8AKHZl5ALkQ6AEIOTAE#v=onepage&amp;q=Ta%C3%ADno%20sometimes%20wore%20nothing%7Cnaked&amp;f=false|accessdate=11 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Taíno lived in settlements called ''yucayeques'', which varied in size depending on the location. Those in Puerto Rico and Hispaniola were the largest, and those in the Bahamas were the smallest. In the center of a typical village was a central plaza, used for various social activities such as games, festivals, religious [[ritual]]s, and public ceremonies. These plazas had many shapes, including oval, rectangular, narrow, and elongated. Ceremonies where the deeds of the ancestors were celebrated, called ''areitos'', were performed here.&lt;ref&gt;Rouse, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

Often, the general population lived in large circular buildings (''bohios''), constructed with wooden poles, woven straw, and palm leaves. These houses, built surrounding the central plaza, could hold 10-15 families each.&lt;ref&gt;Alegría, "Tainos" p. 346.&lt;/ref&gt; The cacique and his family lived in rectangular buildings (''caney'') of similar construction, with wooden porches. Taíno home furnishings included cotton hammocks (''hamaca''), sleeping and sitting mats made of palms, wooden chairs ([[dujo]] or duho) with woven seats, platforms, and cradles for children.

[[File:Parco Cerimoniale Indigeno di Caguana.jpg|thumb|left|Caguana Ceremonial ball court (''batey''), outlined with stones]]
The Taíno played a ceremonial ball game called ''[[batey (game)|batey]]''. Opposing teams had 10 to 30 players per team and used a solid [[rubber]] ball. Normally, the teams were composed of men, but occasionally women played the game as well.&lt;ref name="Alegría, p.348"&gt;Alegría, p.348.&lt;/ref&gt; The Classic Taíno played in the village's center plaza or on especially designed rectangular ball courts called ''batey''. Games on the ''batey'' are believed to have been used for conflict resolution between communities. The most elaborate ball courts are found at chiefdom boundaries.&lt;ref&gt;Rouse, p. 15&lt;/ref&gt; Often, chiefs made wagers on the possible outcome of a game.&lt;ref name="Alegría, p.348"/&gt;

Taíno spoke an [[Arawakan language]] and used an early form of writing [[Proto-writing]] in the form of [[petroglyph]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tainoage.com/meaning.html|title=Taino Symbol Meanings|website=Tainoage.com|accessdate=19 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some words that they used, such as ''barbacoa'' ("barbecue"), ''hamaca'' ("hammock"), ''kanoa'' ("canoe"), ''tabaco'' ("tobacco"), ''[[cassava|yuca]]'', ''batata'' ("sweet potato"), and ''[[juracán]]'' ("hurricane"), have been incorporated into Spanish and English.

For warfare, the men made wooden war clubs, which they called a ''[[macana]].'' It was about one inch thick and was similar to the [[coco macaque]].

==Food and agriculture==

[[File:Manihot esculenta dsc07325.jpg|thumb|right|[[Cassava]], starchy (''yuca'') roots, the Taínos' main crop]]
Taíno staples included vegetables, fruit, meat, and fish. There were no large animals native to the Caribbean, but they captured and ate small animals, such as [[hutia]]s and other mammals, [[earthworms]], [[lizards]], [[turtles]], and [[birds]]. [[Manatees]] were speared and fish were caught in nets, speared, trapped in [[weir]]s, or caught with hook and line. Wild [[parrots]] were decoyed with domesticated birds, and [[iguanas]] were taken from trees and other [[vegetation]]. The Taíno stored live animals until they were ready to be consumed: fish and turtles were stored in weirs, hutias and dogs were stored in corrals.&lt;ref name="Rouse, p.13"&gt;Rouse, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to this lack of large game, the Taíno people became very skilled [[fishermen]]. One technique was to hook a [[remora]], also known as a suckerfish, to a line secured to a canoe and wait for the fish to attach itself to a larger fish or even a sea turtle. Once this happened, men would jump into the water and bring in their assisted catch. Another method used by the Taínos was to take shredded stems and roots of poisonous [[senna (plant)|senna]] shrubs and throw them into nearby streams or rivers. Upon eating the bait, the fish were stunned just long enough to allow the fishermen to gather them in. This poison did not affect the edibility of the fish. Taíno youth, mostly young boys, also collected [[mussel]]s and [[oyster]]s in shallow waters and within the [[mangrove]]s.&lt;ref name="Francine Jacobs"&gt;{{cite book|last=Jacobs|first=Francine|title=The Taínos: The People Who Welcomed Columbus|year=1992|publisher=G. P. Putnam's Sons|location=New York|isbn=0-399-22116-6|pages=26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Taíno groups in the more developed islands, such as Puerto Rico, Hispaniola, and Jamaica, relied more on agriculture (farming and other jobs). Fields for important [[root crops]], such as the staple [[Cassava|yuca]], were prepared by heaping up mounds of soil, called ''conucos.'' This improved soil drainage and fertility as well as delaying erosion, allowed for longer storage of crops in the ground. Less important crops such as corn were raised in simple clearings created by [[slash and burn]] technique. Typically, ''conucos'' were three feet high and nine feet in circumference and were arranged in rows.&lt;ref name="Rouse, p.12"&gt;Rouse, p.12.&lt;/ref&gt; The primary root crop was yuca or [[cassava]], a woody [[shrub]] cultivated for its edible and [[starch]]y [[tuberous root]]. It was planted using a ''coa'', a kind of [[hoe (tool)|hoe]] made completely from wood. Women processed the poisonous variety of cassava by squeezing it to extract the toxic juices. Then they would grind the roots into flour for baking bread. ''Batata'' ([[sweet potato]]) was the next most important root crop.&lt;ref name="Rouse, p.12"/&gt;

Contrary to mainland practices, corn was not ground into flour and baked into bread, but was cooked and eaten off the cob. Corn bread becomes moldy faster than cassava bread in the high humidity of the Caribbean. Corn also was used to make an alcoholic beverage known as [[chicha]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://www.academia.edu/423889/Continuity_Cultural_Dynamics_and_Alcohol_The_Reinterpretation_of_Identity_through_Chicha_in_the_Andes |last=Duke |first=Guy S. |title=Identity Crisis: Archaeological Perspectives on Social Identity |chapter=Continuity, Cultural Dynamics, and Alcohol: The Reinterpretation of Identity through Chicha in the Andes |website=Academia.edu }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Taíno grew [[Squash (fruit)|squash]], [[beans]], [[capsicum|peppers]], [[peanut]]s, and [[pineapple]]s. [[Tobacco]], [[calabash]]es (West Indian pumpkins), and [[cotton]] were grown around the houses. Other fruits and vegetables, such as [[Arecaceae|palm nuts]], [[guava]]s, and ''[[Zamia]]'' roots, were collected from the wild.&lt;ref name="Rouse, p.12"/&gt;

==Spirituality==
[[File:Taino - Zemi - Walters 20056 - Left Side.jpg|thumb|Taíno zemí sculpture&lt;br /&gt;''[[Walters Art Museum]]'']]
Taíno spirituality centered on the worship of [[Zemi|zemís]]. A zemí is a spirit or ancestor. The major Taíno zemis are [[Atabey (goddess)|Atabey]] and her son, [[Yúcahu]]. Atabey, was the zemi of the [[moon]], fresh waters, and fertility. Other names for her include, Guabancex, Atabei, Atabeyra, Atabex, and Guimazoa. Guabancex was the non-nurturing aspect of the zemi Atabey who had control over natural disasters. Juracán is often identified as the zemi of storms, but the word simply means hurricane in the Taíno language. Guabancex had two assistants: Guataubá, a messenger who created hurricane winds, and Coatrisquie who created [[flood]]waters.&lt;ref&gt;Rouse, p. 121.&lt;/ref&gt; The Taínos of Quisqueya (Dominican Republic) called her son, "Yucahú Bagua Maorocotí", which means "White Yuca, great and powerful as the sea and the mountains". He was the spirit of cassava, the zemi of cassava&amp;nbsp;– the Taínos' main crop&amp;nbsp;– and the sea. 

The minor Taíno zemis related to the growing of cassava, the process of life, creation, and death. Baibrama was a minor zemi worshiped for his assistance in growing cassava and curing people from its poisonous juice. Boinayel and his twin brother Márohu were the zemis of rain and fair weather, respectively.&lt;ref name="Rouse, p.119"&gt;Rouse, p. 119.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Maquetaurie Guayaba or Maketaori Guayaba was the zemi of Coaybay or Coabey, the land of the dead. Opiyelguabirán', a dog-shaped zemi, watched over the dead. Deminán Caracaracol, a male cultural hero from whom the Taíno believed themselves to be descended, was worshipped as a zemí.&lt;ref name="Rouse, p.119"/&gt; Macocael was a cultural hero worshipped as a zemi, who had failed to guard the mountain from which [[human beings]] arose. He was punished by being turned into stone, or a bird, a [[frog]], or a reptile, depending on interpretation of the [[myth]].

[[File:Lombards Museum 053.JPG|thumb|left|upright|Zemí, a physical object housing a zemi, spirit, or ancestor&lt;br /&gt;''Lombards Museum'']]
Zemí was also the name the people gave to their physical representations of the Zemis, whether objects or drawings. They were made in many forms and materials and have been found in a variety of settings. The majority of zemís were crafted from wood, but stone, [[bone]], [[Seashell|shell]], [[pottery]], and cotton were used as well.&lt;ref&gt;Rouse, pp. 13, 118.&lt;/ref&gt; Zemí [[petroglyph]]s were carved on rocks in streams, ball courts, and on [[stalagmite]]s in caves. ''Cemí'' [[pictograph]]s were found on secular objects such as pottery, and on [[tattoos]]. Yucahú, the zemi of cassava, was represented with a three-pointed zemí, which could be found in ''conucos'' to increase the yield of cassava. Wood and stone zemís have been found in [[caves]] in Hispaniola and Jamaica.&lt;ref&gt;Rouse, p. 118.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Cemís'' are sometimes represented by [[toads]], turtles, fish, [[snakes]], and various abstract and human-like faces.
[[File:Taino. Cohoba Spoon, 1200-1500.jpg|thumbnail|right|Cohoba Spoon, 1200-1500&lt;br /&gt;''[[Brooklyn Museum]]'']]
[[File:Petroglyph at Caguana.jpg|thumb|right|Rock [[petroglyph]] overlaid with chalk in the Caguana Indigenous Ceremonial Center in Utuado, Puerto Rico]]
Some zemís are accompanied by a small table or tray, which is believed to be a receptacle for [[hallucinogen]]ic [[Herbal smokeless tobacco|snuff]] called ''[[cohoba]],'' prepared from the beans of a species of ''[[Piptadenia]]'' tree. These trays have been found with ornately carved snuff tubes. Before certain ceremonies, Taínos would purify themselves, either by inducing vomiting (with a swallowing stick) or by [[fasting]].&lt;ref&gt;Rouse, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; After communal bread was served, first to the zemí, then to the cacique, and then to the common people, the people would sing the village epic to the accompaniment of [[maraca]] and other instruments.

One Taíno [[oral tradition]] explains that the Sun and Moon come out of caves. Another story tells of people who once lived in caves and only came out at night, because it was believed that the Sun would transform them. The Taíno believed they were descended from the union of the cultural hero Deminán Caracaracol and a female turtle. The origin of the oceans is described in the story of a huge flood that occurred when a father murdered his son (who was about to murder the father). The father put his son's bones into a [[gourd]] or [[calabash]]. When the bones turned into fish, the gourd broke, and all the water of the world came pouring out.

Taínos believed that Jupias, the souls of the dead, would go to Coaybay, the underworld, and there they rest by day. At night they would assume the form of bats and eat the [[guava]] fruit.

==Spaniards and Taíno==
Columbus and his crew were the first [[European ethnic groups|Europeans]] to encounter the Taíno people, as they landed in The Bahamas on October 12, 1492. After their first interaction, Columbus described the Taínos as a physically tall, well-proportioned people, with a noble and kind personality.

In his diary, Columbus wrote:
{{quote|They traded with us and gave us everything they had, with good will&amp;nbsp;... they took great delight in pleasing us&amp;nbsp;... They are very gentle and without knowledge of what is evil; nor do they murder or steal...Your highness may believe that in all the world there can be no better people&amp;nbsp;... They love their neighbours as themselves, and they have the sweetest talk in the world, and are gentle and always laughing.&lt;ref&gt;Kirkpatrick Sale, ''The Conquest of Paradise'', p. 100, {{ISBN|0-333-57479-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

At this time, the neighbors of the Taíno were the [[Guanahatabey]]s in the western tip of Cuba, the Island-Caribs in the Lesser Antilles from [[Guadeloupe]] to [[Grenada]], and the [[Calusa]] and [[Ais (tribe)|Ais]] nations of [[Florida]]. Guanahaní was the Taíno name for the island that Columbus renamed as ''San Salvador'' (Spanish for "Holy Savior"). Columbus called the Taíno "Indians", a reference that has grown to encompass all the indigenous peoples of the [[Western Hemisphere]]. A group of Taíno people accompanied Columbus on his return voyage to Spain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=North American Exploration: A New World Disclosed. Volume: 1 |author=Allen, John Logan |publisher=University of Nebraska Press |year=1997 |page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On Columbus' second voyage to their culture, he began to require tribute from the Taíno in Hispaniola. According to [[Kirkpatrick Sale]], each adult over 14 years of age was expected to deliver a hawks bell full of gold every three months, or when this was lacking, twenty-five pounds of spun cotton. If this tribute was not brought, the Spanish cut off the hands of the Taíno and left them to bleed to death.&lt;ref&gt;Kirkpatrick Sale, "The Conquest of Paradise", p. 155, {{ISBN|0-333-57479-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; These cruel practices inspired many revolts by the Taíno and campaigns against the Spanish — some being successful, some not.

In 1511, several caciques in Puerto Rico, such as [[Agüeybaná II]], [[Arasibo]], [[Hayuya]], [[Jumacao]], [[Urayoán]], [[Guarionex]], and [[Orocobix]], allied with the Carib and tried to oust the Spaniards. The revolt was suppressed by the Indio-Spanish forces of Governor [[Juan Ponce de León]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=De Orbe Novo, the Eight Decades of Peter Martyr D'Anghera | author= Anghiera Pietro Martire D'| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=e7hU_LePtIQC&amp;pg=PA122&amp;dq=guarionex+revolt&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=CQw5TLT7NYGC8ga_zYWoBg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CDEQ6AEwAg#v=snippet&amp;q=three%20thousand%20islanders&amp;f=false | accessdate=31 July 2010 | page=143}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hatuey]], a Taíno chieftain who had fled from Hispaniola to Cuba with 400 natives to unite the Cuban natives, was burned at the stake on February 2, 1512.

In Hispaniola, a Taíno chieftain named [[Enriquillo]] mobilized more than 3,000 Taíno in a successful rebellion in the 1520s. These Taíno were accorded land and a charter from the royal administration. Despite the small Spanish military presence in the region, they often used diplomatic divisions and, with help from powerful native allies, controlled most of the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=De Orbe Novo, the Eight Decades of Peter Martyr D'Anghera | author= Anghiera Pietro Martire D'| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=e7hU_LePtIQC&amp;pg=PA122&amp;dq=guarionex+revolt&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=CQw5TLT7NYGC8ga_zYWoBg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CDEQ6AEwAg#v=snippet&amp;q=water%20extreme%20heat&amp;f=false | accessdate=10 July 2010 | page=132}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=De Orbe Novo, the Eight Decades of Peter Martyr D'Anghera | author= Anghiera Pietro Martire D'| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=e7hU_LePtIQC&amp;pg=PA122&amp;dq=guarionex+revolt&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=CQw5TLT7NYGC8ga_zYWoBg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CDEQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=concluding&amp;f=false | accessdate=10 July 2010 | page=199}}&lt;/ref&gt; In exchange for a seasonal salary, religious and language education, the Taíno were required to work for Spanish and Indian land owners. This system of labor was part of the ''[[encomienda]]''.

==Women==

Taíno society was based on a [[Matrilineality|matrilineal]] system and descent was traced through the mother. Women lived in village groups containing their children. The men lived separately. Because of this Taíno women had extensive control over their lives, their co-villagers, and their bodies.&lt;ref&gt;Saunders, Nicholas J. Peoples of the Caribbean: An Encyclopedia of Archeology and Traditional Culture. Santa Barbara, CA: ABC-CLIO, 2005. Web.&lt;/ref&gt; Since they lived separately from men, they were able to decide when they wanted to participate in sexual contact. This social organization partially shaped the views of [[conquistador]]s who came in contact with Taíno culture. They reportedly perceived women as "macha women" who had strong control over the men.

Although unclear, most historical evidence suggests that Taíno gender roles were non exclusive regarding most of the activities in their community.

Taíno women played an important role in intercultural interaction between [[Spaniards]] and the Taíno people. When Taíno men were away fighting intervention from other groups, women assumed the roles of primary food producers or ritual specialists.&lt;ref&gt;Dale, Corrine H., and J. H. E. Paine. Women on the Edge: Ethnicity and Gender in Short Stories by American Women. New York: Garland Pub., 1999. Web.&lt;/ref&gt; Women seem to have  participated in all levels of the Taíno political hierarchy, occupying roles as high up as being ''[[cacique]]s''.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, Patrick, and Frederick I. Case. The Encyclopedia of Caribbean Religions Volume 1: A-L; Volume 2: M-Z. Baltimore: U of Illinois, 2015. Web. Chapter title Taínos.&lt;/ref&gt; Potentially, this meant that Taíno women could make the important choices for the village and could give the permission for Taíno men and women to take on the important tasks needed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Deagan | first1 = Kathleen | year = 2004 | title = Reconsidering Taino Social Dynamics after Spanish Conquest: Gender and Class in Culture Contact Studies | url = | journal = American Antiquity | volume = 69 | issue = 4| page = 597 | doi=10.2307/4128440}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is evidence that suggests that the women who were wealthiest among the tribe collected crafted goods that they would then use for trade or as gifts.

Despite women being seemingly independent in Taíno society, during the era of contact Spaniards took Taíno women as an exchange item, putting them in a non-autonomous position. Dr. Chanca, a physician who traveled with [[Christopher Columbus]], reported in a letter that Spaniards took as many women as they possibly could and kept them as [[Concubinage|concubines]].&lt;ref&gt;Hotep, Amon. "Women." Race and History.com | TAINO | Women. N.p., n.d. Web. 29 Nov. 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Some sources report that, despite women being free and powerful before the contact era, they became the first commodities up for Spaniards to trade, or often, steal. This marked the beginning of a lifetime of kidnapping and abuse of Taíno women.&lt;ref&gt;Sloan, Kathryn A. Women's Roles in Latin America and the Caribbean. Santa Barbara, CA: Greenwood, 2011. Web.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Depopulation==

Early population estimates of Hispaniola, probably the most populous island inhabited by Taínos, range from 100,000 to 1,000,000 people. The maximum estimates for Jamaica and Puerto Rico are 600,000 people.&lt;ref&gt;Rouse, p.7.&lt;/ref&gt; The Spanish priest and defender of the Taíno, [[Bartolomé de las Casas]] (who had lived in [[Santo Domingo]]), wrote in his 1561 multi-volume ''History of the Indies'':&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.interamerdeminst.org/H8.html|title= Endless War of Domination|accessdate= 2007-10-02|work= Student-Employee Assistance Program Against Chemical Dependency|deadurl= yes|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071016185314/http://interamerdeminst.org/H8.html|archivedate= 2007-10-16|df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In thirty years, between 80% and 90% of the Taíno population died.&lt;ref&gt;"La tragédie des Taïnos", in ''[[L'Histoire]]'' n°322, July–August 2007, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the increased number of people (Spanish) on the island, there was a higher demand for food. Taíno cultivation was converted to Spanish methods. In hopes of frustrating the Spanish, some Taínos refused to plant or harvest their crops. The supply of food became so low in 1495 and 1496 that some 50,000 died from the severity of the famine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=De Orbe Novo, the Eight Decades of Peter Martyr D'Anghera | author= Anghiera Pietro Martire D'| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=e7hU_LePtIQC&amp;pg=PA122&amp;dq=guarionex+revolt&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=CQw5TLT7NYGC8ga_zYWoBg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CDEQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=50%2C000&amp;f=false | accessdate=21 July 2010 | page=108}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historians have determined that the massive decline was due more to infectious disease outbreaks than any warfare or direct attacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=De Orbe Novo, the Eight Decades of Peter Martyr D'Anghera | author= Anghiera Pietro Martire D'| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=e7hU_LePtIQC&amp;pg=PA122&amp;dq=guarionex+revolt&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=CQw5TLT7NYGC8ga_zYWoBg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CDEQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=thirty&amp;f=false | accessdate=21 July 2010 | page=160}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Arthur C.

==Taíno heritage in modern times==
Groups of people currently identify as Taíno, most notably among the [[Puerto Ricans]], [[Cubans]], [[Jamaicans]], and [[People of the Dominican Republic|Dominicans]], both on the islands and on [[United States]] mainland.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/travel/what-became-of-the-taino-73824867/|title=What Became of the Taíno|last=Poole|first=Robert M.|date=October 2011|work=Smithsonian Magazine|access-date=November 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some scholars, such as Jalil Sued Badillo, an ethnohistorian at the [[University of Puerto Rico]], assert that although the official Spanish histories speak of the disappearance of the Taínos as an ethnic identification, many survivors left descendants - usually by intermarrying with other [[ethnic groups]]. Recent research revealed a high percentage of mixed or tri-racial ancestry in Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic. Those claiming Taíno ancestry also have Spanish ancestry or African ancestry, and often, both.

Frank Moya Pons, a Dominican historian, documented that Spanish colonists intermarried with Taíno women. Over time, some of their mixed descendants intermarried with Africans, creating a tri-racial [[Creole peoples|Creole]] culture. 1514 census records reveal that 40% of Spanish men on the island of Hispaniola had Taíno wives.&lt;!-- &lt;ref name=21st/&gt;--&gt; Ethnohistorian Lynne Guitar writes that the Taíno were declared extinct in Spanish documents as early as the sixteenth century; however, individual Taínos continued to appear in wills and legal records for several decades after the arrival of the Spaniards.{{sfn|Guitar|2000|}}

Evidence suggests that some Taíno men and African women inter-married and lived in relatively isolated [[Maroon (people)|Maroon]] communities in the interior of the islands, where they evolved into a hybrid rural or campesino population with little or no interference from the Spanish authorities. Scholars also note that contemporary rural Dominicans retain Taíno linguistic features, agricultural practices, food ways, [[medicine]], fishing practices, [[technology]], [[architecture]], [[oral history]], and religious views. Often these cultural traits are looked down upon by urbanites as backward, however.{{sfn|Guitar|2000|}}

Sixteen “autosomal” studies of peoples in the Spanish-speaking Caribbean and its diaspora (mostly Puerto Ricans) have shown that between 10-20% of their DNA is indigenous, with some individuals having slightly higher scores and others having lower scores or no indigenous DNA at all.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Haslip-Viera |first=Gabriel |title=Race, Identity and Indigenous Politics: Puerto Rican Neo-Taínos in the Diaspora and the Island |publisher=Latino Studies Press |date=2014 |pages=111–117}}&lt;/ref&gt; A recent study of a population in eastern Puerto Rico where the majority of persons tested claimed Taíno ancestry and pedigree showed that they had 61% mtDNA (distant maternal ancestry) and 0% y-chromosome DNA (distant paternal ancestry) demonstrating as expected that this is a hybrid creole population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Vilar |first=Miguel G. |title=Genetic diversity in Puerto Rico and its implications for the peopling of the island and the Caribbean |journal=American Journal of Physical Anthropology|date=July 2014 |volume=155|issue=3|pages=352–68|display-authors=etal |doi=10.1002/ajpa.22569 |pmid=25043798}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Groups, such as the Jatibonicu Taino Tribal Nation of Boriken Puerto Rico (1970), the Taíno Nation of the Antilles N.Y.C. (1993), United Confederation of Taíno People N.Y.C (1998), and El Pueblo Guatu Ma-Cu A Borikén Puerto Rico (2000), have been established to foster Taíno culture.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}
Taíno activists have created two unique writing scripts. The scripts are used to write Spanish, not a retained language from pre-Columbian ancestors.&lt;ref&gt;Sherina Feliciano-Santos. 2011.

The [[LGTK]] ([[Liga Guakía Taína-ké]]) has promoted teaching their script among elementary and middle school students to strengthen their interest in Taíno identity.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}

In February 2018, a DNA study from an ancient tooth determined that the Taínos have living descendants in Puerto Rico, indicating that most Puerto Ricans have a degree of Taíno ancestry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsweek.com/taino-caribbean-indigenous-people-extinct-812729|title=The Taíno were written off as extinct.

'''''Terra pericolosa''''' is an [[Italian language|Italian]] [[phrase]] for "dangerous land", used in [[cartography]] to denote regions that are believed to be likely to put the travellers in jeopardy.  Such regions would probably not have been mapped or documented fully.

'''Tewa''' is a [[Tanoan language]] spoken by [[Pueblo people]], mostly in the [[Rio Grande]] valley in [[New Mexico]] north of [[Santa Fe, New Mexico|Santa Fe]], and in [[Arizona]]. It is also known as '''Tano,'''&lt;ref name = "native-languages" &gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; or (archaic) Tée-wah.

== Dialects and usage ==
The 1980 census counted 1,298 speakers, almost all of whom are bilingual in English. Each pueblo or reservation where it is spoken has a dialect:

* [[Nambe Pueblo]]: 50 speakers (1980); 34 speakers (2004)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Pojoaque Pueblo]]: 25 speakers (1980)
* [[San Ildefonso Pueblo]] (''P'ohwhóge Owingeh''): 349 speakers
* [[Ohkay Owingeh]]: 495 speakers (1980)
* [[Santa Clara Pueblo]]: 207 speakers (1980)
* [[Tesuque Pueblo]]: 172 speakers (1980)

Tewa is also spoken by the [[Arizona Tewa]] (Hopi-Tewa, Tano) who live at Hano on the [[Hopi]] Reservation in [[Arizona]].

As of 2012, Tewa is defined as "definitely endangered" in Arizona and "severely endangered" in New Mexico by UNESCO.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web
| title = UNESCO Atlas of the World's Languages in danger
| accessdate = 2012-09-29
| url = http://www.unesco.org/culture/languages-atlas/index.php
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the names "Pojoaque" and "Tesuque", the element spelled "que" (pronounced something like {{IPA|[ɡe]}} in Tewa, or {{IPA|/ki/}} in English) is Tewa for "place".

Tewa can be written with the [[Latin script]]; this is occasionally used for such purposes as signs (''Be-pu-wa-ve'', "Welcome", or ''sen-ge-de-ho'',"Bye"). Because alphabet systems have been developed in the different pueblos, Tewa has  a variety of orthographies rather than a single standardized alphabet.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The written form of the language is not as ubiquitous as in languages such as [[Cherokee language|Cherokee]] or [[Navajo language|Navajo]], because some Tewa speakers feel that the language should be passed on through the [[oral tradition]].&lt;ref name = "native-languages" /&gt; The Tewa language was a spoken language through the 1960s; [[language documentation|digital language documentation]] efforts were underway as of 1995.&lt;ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4796">'''''The Chinese in Latin America and the Caribbean''''' is a 2010 book edited by Walton Look Lai and Tan Chee-Beng and published by [[Brill Publishers|Brill]].

The essays in the book were previously published as a portion of an issue of the ''[[Journal of Overseas Chinese]]'', a publication of the [[International Society for the Study of Chinese Overseas]] (ISSCO) of Singapore. Look Lai is a [[University of the West Indies]] (UWI) professor who specialized in studying the [[British Caribbean]] population of Chinese and Southeast Asians. Tan, a Hong Kong-based man who is the editor of the ''Journal of Overseas Chinese'', is a specialist in studying the Southeast Asian ethnic Chinese populations.&lt;ref name=Tchenp372&gt;Tchen, p. 372.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contents==
Look Lai wrote the introduction.&lt;ref name=Tchenp372/&gt;

The remaining portion of the book has three parts, which together have eight chapters.&lt;ref name=Martin&gt;Martin, Dorothea A.L. ([[Appalachian State University]]). "[http://hsozkult.geschichte.hu-berlin.de/rezensionen/id=17733 Chinese in Latin America]" ([https://www.webcitation.org/6Qy5kBCNG Archive]) H-Soz-u-Kult ([http://hsozkult.geschichte.hu-berlin.de/index.asp?pn=about website of the History Department of the] [[Humboldt University of Berlin]]). 13 December 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The Chinese immigration discussed in these chapters include those from the early colonial era to the present.&lt;ref name=Tchenp372/&gt;

The sole article of Part I is "The Early Colonial Period" by Edward Slack, Jr. This article discusses the first [[Chinese immigration to Mexico]].&lt;ref name=Martin/&gt; The source material of this chapter originates from the [[General Archive of the Indies]] in [[Seville]], [[Spain]] and the ''[[Archivo General de la Nación (Mexico)|Archivo General de la Nación]]'' in [[Mexico City]].&lt;ref&gt;Tchen, p. 372-373.&lt;/ref&gt; John Kuo Wei Tchen of [[New York University]] wrote that the Slack article "is a valuable baseline framing of the early Manila-Acapulco “China trade,” the Asian peoples moving to colonial Mexico, and the emergence of the New World typology of “chino” or “indio chino,” a legal subcategory of the “indios” of the Americas."&lt;ref name=Tchenp372/&gt;

Part II, "The Classic Migration," includes Chapters 2-5. Chapter 2, written by Look Lai, discusses overall migration from Asia during the 19th Century. Chapter 3, written by [[Evelyn Hu-Dehart]], discusses [[anti-Chinese sentiment]] in Latin America.&lt;ref name=Martin/&gt; Hu-Dehart's essay examines a question asked by [[Nicolás Cárdenas García]], a scholar from Mexico, on whether the Chinese in Latin America are "integrated and foreign."&lt;ref name=Tchen373&gt;Tchen, p. 373.&lt;/ref&gt; Chapter 4,&lt;ref name=Martin/&gt; written by [[Belize|Belizian]] St. John Robinson, is a comparative analysis&lt;ref name=Tchen373/&gt; which discusses Chinese populations of Central America. Chapter 5, written by Lisa Yun, is an interview with [[Ruthanne Lum]] discussing Lum's book, ''[[God of Luck]]''. Dorothea A. L. Martin of [[Appalachian State University]] stated that the first two chapters of this section are "the anchors of the work".&lt;ref name=Martin/&gt;

Part III, "Old Migrants, new Immigration," includes Chapters 6-8. The overall focus are relations between different generations of immigrants in Latin America. Chapter 6, by Isabelle Lausent-Herrera, discusses the history and internal relations of [[Chinese Peruvians]]. Chapter 7,&lt;ref name=Martin/&gt; written by anthropologist Paul B. Tjon Sie Fat, discusses the groups of [[Chinese Surinamese]] and their responses to anti-Chinese sentiment.&lt;ref name=Tchen373/&gt; Chapter 8, by Kathleen Lopez, discusses [[Chinese Cubans]] in the post-Soviet Union era.&lt;ref name=Martin/&gt; The article discusses a [[China-Cuba relations|PRC-Cuba]] initiative to renovate the [[Havana#Chinatown|Havana Chinatown]].&lt;ref name=Tchen373/&gt;

The '''West India Committee''', later also known as '''The Committee to the West Indies''' was an English charity formed out of the [[London Society of West India Planters and Merchants]], established in 1780 as a lobby group for British-based merchants and absentee [[plantocracy|plantation owners]] with business interests in the Caribbean and which later became a group promoting Caribbean businesses to the world's major markets.

==History==
The principal commodities were [[cane sugar]], [[rum]], [[mahogany]], other softwood, spices and tropical produce, early on largely confined to types which would last a long transatlantic voyage such as [[coffee]], nuts and desiccated coconut but later expanded to include tropical fruits in general.

In 1904, the committee received a (royal) charter of incorporation at the initiative of the British government.  It later acquired charitable status and established two subsidiary bodies: 
*The Caribbean Council for Europe (CCE)
*The Caribbean Trade Advisory Group (Caritag).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A Brief History of the West India Committee |first=Douglas |last=Hall |publisher=Caribbean University Press |date= 1971 |isbn= 0854740007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;West India Committee: Official Archives, 1899–1998&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.charity-commission.gov.uk/ |title=Charity number 258545 |publisher=Charity Commission}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20110810/lead/lead91.html |title=West India Committee renews focus on Jamaica |newspaper=Jamaica Gleaner |date=2011-08-10 |accessdate=2013-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.westindiacommittee.org/ |title=Welcome to |publisher=West India Committee |date= |accessdate=2013-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among its records are for example eight collections of Caribbean and English newspapers 1761–1846, reports of the Acting Committee to the Half-Yearly Meeting of the Standing Committee of West India Planters and Merchants, 1878–1883 and albums of photographs and press cuttings on the [[1907 Kingston earthquake]] in Jamaica, a country that was a major subject of its promotion work.&lt;ref name=a&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archiveshub.ac.uk/data/gb0101-ics96.txt |title=West India Committee: Acquired Papers, 1750–1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Staff==
From at least 1915–1929&lt;ref name=a/&gt; its Secretary was Sir Algernon Edward Aspinall who in the name of his committee published geographical guides to [[Guyana]] and the British Caribbean, such as a 1907 [[Stanford's Guides|Stanford's Guide]]: ''Pocket Guide to the West Indies'' and ''The Handbook of the British West Indies, British Guiana and [[British Honduras]]'' (1929).
The Chief Executive is [[Blondel Cluff]] CBE, who is also the [[Anguilla]] government’s representative in the United Kingdom. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Cluff in Anguilla for opening of maternity ward at hospital |url=https://www.thedailyherald.sx/islands/82878-cluff-in-anguilla-for-opening-of-maternity-ward-at-hospital |accessdate=29 November 2018 |publisher=Daily Herald |date=21 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{nihongo|'''''Yōga'''''|洋画||literally "Western-style painting"}} is a style of [[painting]]s by Japanese artists, made in accordance with Western (European) traditional conventions, techniques and materials. The term was coined in the [[Meiji period]], to distinguish such works from indigenous traditional [[Japanese painting]]s, or {{nihongo|''[[Nihonga]]''|日本画}}.

== History ==
European painting was introduced to Japan during the late [[Muromachi period]] along with [[Christian missionaries]]. Early religious works by Japanese artists in imitation of works brought by the missionaries can be considered some of the earliest forms of ''Yōga''. However, the [[sakoku|policy of national seclusion]] introduced by the [[Tokugawa bakufu]] in the [[Edo period]] effectively ended the influence of western art on Japanese painting, with the exception of the use of [[perspective (graphical)|perspective]], which was discovered by Japanese artists in sketches found in European medical and scientific texts imported from the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] via [[Nagasaki, Nagasaki|Nagasaki]].

In 1855, the Tokugawa ''bakufu'' established the ''[[Bansho Shirabesho]],'' a translation and research institute for western studies, including a section to investigate western art. This section was headed by [[Kawakami Togai]], whose assistant [[Takahashi Yuichi]] was a student of English artist [[Charles Wirgman]]. Takahashi is regarded by many as the first true Yōga painter.

In 1876, the ''Kobu Bijutsu Gakko'' ([[Tokyo Institute of Technology|Technical Art School]]) was established by the Meiji government as Japan's first dedicated ''Yōga'' art school. [[o-yatoi gaikokujin|Foreign advisors]], such as the Italian artist [[Antonio Fontanesi]], were hired by the government to teach Japanese artists, such as [[Asai Chu]] in the latest western techniques.

In the 1880s, the general reaction against Westernization and the growth in popularity and strength of the ''[[Nihonga]]'' movement caused the temporary decline of ''Yōga''. The ''Kobu Bijutsu Gakko'' was forced to close in 1883, and when the ''Tokyo Bijutsu Gakko'' (the forerunner of the [[Tokyo National University of Fine Arts and Music]]) was established in 1887, only ''Nihonga'' subjects were taught.

However, in 1889, the ''Meiji Bijutsukai'' (Meiji Fine Arts Society) was established by ''Yōga'' artists, and in 1893, the return of [[Kuroda Seiki]] from his studies in Europe gave fresh impetus to the ''Yōga'' genre. From 1896, a Yōga department was added to the curriculum of the ''Tokyo Bijutsu Gakko'', and from that point onwards, ''Yōga'' has been an accepted component of Japanese painting.

Since that time, ''Yōga'' and ''Nihonga'' have been the two main divisions of modern Japanese painting. This division is reflected in education, the mounting of exhibitions, and the identification of artists. However, in many cases ''Nihonga'' artists also adopted realistic Western painting techniques, such as perspective and shading. Because of this tendency to synthesize, although ''Nihonga'' forms a distinct category within the Japanese annual ''[[Japan Art Academy|Nitten]]'' exhibitions, in recent years, it has become increasingly difficult to draw a distinct separation in either techniques or materials between ''Nihonga'' and ''Yōga''.

== Materials ==
''Yōga'' in its broadest sense encompasses [[oil painting]], [[watercolor]]s, [[pastels]], [[pen-and-ink drawing|ink sketches]], [[lithography]], [[etching]] and other techniques developed in western culture. However, in a more limited sense, ''Yōga'' is sometimes used specifically to refer to oil painting.

'''Ziran''' is a key concept in [[Daoism]] that literally means "self so; so of its own; so of itself" and thus "naturally; natural; spontaneously; freely; in the course of events; of course; doubtlessly". &lt;ref&gt;Slingerland, Edward G. (2003). ''Effortless action: Wu-wei as conceptual metaphor and spiritual ideal in early China''. Oxford: Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|0-19-513899-6}}, p. 97&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lai, Karyn. ''Learning from Chinese Philosophies: Ethics of Interdependent And Contextualised Self.'' Ashgate World Philosophies Series. {{ISBN|0-7546-3382-9}}. p. 96&lt;/ref&gt; This Chinese word is a two-character [[compound (linguistics)|compound]] of ''zi'' (自) "nose; self; oneself; from; since" and ''ran'' (然) "right; correct; so; yes", which is used as a ''-ran'' [[suffix]] marking [[adjective]]s or [[adverb]]s (roughly corresponding to English ''-ly''). In Chinese culture, the nose (or zi) is a common metaphor for a person's point of view.&lt;ref&gt;Callahan, W. A. (1989). "A Linguistic Interpretation of Discourse and Perspective in Daoism", ''Philosophy East and West'' 39(2), 171-189.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin==
The word 'ziran' first occurs in the [[Daodejing]] (17, 23, 25, 51) and refers to the structure of [[Tao|Dao]], which cannot be referred back to anything else. It is generally accepted that the philosopher [[Laozi]], author of the Daodejing, coined the term. Ziran is a central concept of Daoism, closely tied to the practice of [[Wu wei|wuwei]], detached or effortless action. Ziran refers to a state of "as-it-isness,"&lt;ref&gt;Fu, C. W. (2000). "Lao Tzu's Conception of Tao", in B. Gupta &amp; J. N. Mohanty (Eds.) ''Philosophical Questions East and West'' (pp. 46–62). Lanham: Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt; the most important quality for anyone following Daoist beliefs. To become nearer to a state of ziran, one must become separate from unnatural influences and returned to an entirely natural, spontaneous state. Ziran is related to developing an "altered sense of human nature and of nature per se".&lt;ref&gt;Hall, David L. (1987). "On Seeking a Change of Environment: A Quasi-Taoist. Philosophy", ''Philosophy East and West'' 37(2), 160-171&lt;/ref&gt; When it comes to sensibility of Taoism, the moral import can be most found in ziran.

==Recent reinterpretation==
Ziran has been interpreted and reinterpreted in a great number of ways over time. Most commonly it has been seen as a model that was followed by the Dao, Heaven, Earth, and Man in turn, based on the traditional translation and interpretation of Chapter 25 of the Daodejing. Wang's more modern translation eliminates the logical flaw that arises when one considers that to model oneself after another entity may be to become less natural, to lose the 'as-it-isness' that ziran refers to. Wang reinterprets the words of Chapter 25 to be instructions to follow the model set by Earth's being Earth, by Heaven's being Heaven, and by the Dao being the Dao; each behaving perfectly in accordance with ziran. This interpretation reaffirms that the base nature of the Dao is one of complete naturalness.&lt;ref name="Wang 2003"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.confuchina.com/05%20zongjiao/Lao%20Zi's%20Concept%20of%20Zi%20Ran.htm|title="It-self-so-ing" and "Other-ing" in Lao Zi's Concept of Zi Ran|last=Wang|first=Qingjie James|date=25 January 2003|accessdate=21 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Existence by Ziran==
Wing-Chuek Chan provides another translation of 'ziran:' "It is so by virtue of its own".&lt;ref name="Chan 2005"&gt;Chan, Wing-Chuek (2005). "On Heidegger's Interpretation of Aristotle: A Chinese Perspective", ''Journal of Chinese Philosophy'' 32(4),  539-557.&lt;/ref&gt; This brings up ziran's link to another Daoist belief, specifically that the myriad things exist because of the qualities that they possess, not because they were created by any being to fulfill a purpose or goal. The only thing that a being must be when it exists in accordance with ziran is ultimately natural, unaffected by artificial influences.

==Additional information==
Ziran and Tianran are related concepts. Tianran refers to a thing created by heaven that is ultimately untouched by human influence, a thing fully characterized by ziran. The two terms are sometimes interchangeably used.&lt;ref name="Chan 2005" /&gt; It can be said that by gaining ziran, a person grows nearer to a state of tianran.

Ziran can also be looked at from under Buddha's influence, "non-substantial". It is then believed to mean 'having no nature of its own'.&lt;ref&gt;Pregadio, Fabrizio. ed. (2008). ''The Encyclopedia of Taoism'' M-Z Vol 2. Routledge. pg. 1302&lt;/ref&gt; In this aspect it is seen as a synonym of real emptiness.

D. T. Suzuki, in a brief article penned in 1959, makes the suggestion of ''ziran'' as an aesthetic of action: "Living is an act of creativity demonstrating itself. Creativity is objectively seen as necessity, but from the inner point of view of Emptiness it is 'just-so-ness,' (ziran). It literally means 'byitself-so-ness,' implying more inner meaning than 'spontaneity' or 'naturalness'".&lt;ref&gt;Suzuki, D. T. (1959). "Basic Thoughts Underlying Eastern Ethical and Social Practice." ''Philosophy East and West'' 9(1/2) Preliminary Report on the Third East-West Philosophers' Conference. (April-July, 1959)&lt;/ref&gt;
