'''Abraham (Avraham) ben Samuel Firkovich''' ([[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] '''אברהם בן שמואל''' - ''Avraham ben Shmuel''; [[Karaim language|Karayce]]: '''Аврагъам Фиркович''' - ''Avragham Firkovich'') (1786–1874) was a famous Karaite writer and archeologist, collector of ancient manuscripts, and a Karaite [[Hakham#Karaite_Judaism|Hakham]]. He was born in [[Lutsk]], [[Volhynia]], then lived in [[Lithuania]], and finally settled in [[Çufut Qale]], [[Crimea]]. Gabriel Firkovich of Troki was his son-in-law.

== Biography ==
{{Original research|date=August 2016 |reason = not all from the Jewish encyclopedia need checking and cites}}
[[File:Abraham ben Samuel Firkovich.jpg|left|thumb|Abraham Firkovich, date unknown. From the 1901-1906 [[Jewish Encyclopedia]].]]

Abraham Firkovic was born into a [[Crimean Karaites|Crimean Karaite]] farming family in the [[Lutsk]] district of [[Volyn Oblast|Volhynia]], then part of the [[Russian Empire]], now [[Ukraine]]. At age 25 he went bankrupt.{{cn|date=August 2016}} He then began to study [[Hebrew]], [[Torah]] and other holy books.{{cn|date=August 2016}} In 1818 he was appointed junior [[hazzan]] of the [[Lutsk]] [[Crimean Karaites]] community. Because of a dispute with the older [[hazzan]] he had to leave and emigrate to [[Evpatoria]] in Crimea, where he was appointed in 1823 to the [[hacham]] and the head of the local [[Crimean Karaites]] community.{{cn|date=August 2016}} In 1825, he sent a letter to the [[Czar]], that proposed to settle the Jewish population from the border of Russia and bring the Jews working the land, but the proposal was rejected.{{clarify |date=August 2016 |reason= what was the proposal?}}{{cn|date=August 2016}} In 1828 he moved to [[Berdichev]], where he met [[Hasidism]] and Jewish Scriptures that were unacceptable to the [[Karaite Judaism|Karaites]], such as the [[Talmud]]. The encounter with Rabbinical Jews brought Firkovic into conflict with them. He published a book, "Massah and Meribah" (Yevpatoria, 1838) which raised serious allegations against the Jewish way of life. In later years when he was reconciled with the [[Rabbinites]], he apologized for the sentiments contained in that pamphlet. In 1830 he visited Jerusalem, where he collected many Jewish manuscripts. On his return he remained two years in [[Constantinople]], as teacher in the Karaite community there. He then went to [[Crimea]] and organized a society to publish old Karaite works, of which several appeared in [[Yevpatoria]] (Koslov) with comments by him. In 1838 he was the teacher of the children of [[Sima Babovich]], the head of the Russian Crimean Karaites, who one year later recommended him to [[Mikhail Semyonovich Vorontsov|Count Vorontzov]] and to the Historical Society of [[Odessa]] as a suitable man to send to collect material for the history of the Crimean Karaites. In 1839, Firkovich began excavations in the ancient cemetery of [[Çufut Qale]], and unearthed many old tombstones, claiming that some of them dated from the first centuries of the common era. The following two years were spent in travels through the [[Caucasus]], where he ransacked the [[genizah|genizot]] of the old Jewish communities and collected many valuable manuscripts. He went as far as [[Derbent]], and returned in 1842. In later years he made other journeys of the same nature, visiting Egypt and other countries. In Odessa he became the friend of [[Bezalel Stern]] and of [[Simchah Pinsker]], and while residing in Wilna he made the acquaintance of [[Samuel Joseph Fuenn]] and other Hebrew scholars. In 1871 he visited the small Karaite community in [[Halych]], [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]], where he introduced several reforms. From there he went to Vienna, where he was introduced to [[Count Beust]] and also made the acquaintance of [[Adolph Jellinek]]. He returned to pass his last days in Çufut Qale, of which there now remained only a few buildings and many ruins. However, Firkovich's house is still preserved in the site.

Firkovich collected a vast number of Hebrew, Arabic and Samaritan manuscripts during his many travels in his search for evidence concerning the traditions of his people.{{cn|date=August 2016}} These included thousands of Jewish documents from throughout the [[Russian Empire]] in what became known as the First Firkovich Collection. His Second Collection contains material collected from the Near East.{{cn|date=August 2016}} His visit took place about thirty years before [[Solomon Schechter]]'s more famous trip to Egypt. Though this "Second Firkovich Collection" contains only 13,700 items in comparison to Schechter's 140,000, the Firkovich documents are generally more complete.{{cn|date=August 2016}}

As a result of his research he became focused on the origin of the ancestors of the [[Crimean Karaites]] who he claimed where the descendants of [[Israelite]] teachers (mainly from the tribes of Simeon and Levi and their [[Carian]] bodyguard from [[Caphtor]]){{Citation needed|date=August 2012}} who had arrived in Crimea to convert the natives before the common era{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}} (thus not being culpable for the crucifixion of [[Jesus]]).{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}} His theories persuaded the Russian imperial court that [[Crimean Karaites]] cannot be accused in Jesus' [[Crucifixion]] and they were excluded from the restrictive measures against [[Jew]]s.{{cn|date=August 2016}}

Upon his death in 1874, Firkovich's collection was bought by the [[Russian National Library]].{{cn|date=August 2016}}

Among the treasures in the Firkovich collection is a manuscript of the ''Garden of Metaphors'', an aesthetic appreciation of Biblical literature written in [[Judeo-Arabic]] by one of the greatest of the [[Sephardi]] poets, [[Moses ibn Ezra]].{{cn|date=August 2016}}

Probably the greatest service that Firkovich rendered to Jewish studies was the awakening of interest in Karaite history and literature, that led to the discussion of his alleged discoveries. His personal contributions to it are mostly of a bibliographical nature, and great caution is necessary in utilizing his materials.

== Works ==
Firkovich's chief work is his "Abne Zikkaron," containing the texts of inscriptions discovered by him (Wilna, 1872). It is preceded by a lengthy account of his travels to [[Republic of Dagestan|Daghestan]], characterized by Strack as a mixture of truth and fiction. His other works are "Ḥotam Toknit," antirabbinical polemics, appended to his edition of the "Mibḥar Yesharim" by Aaron the elder (Koslov, 1835); "Ebel Kabod," on the death of his wife and of his son Jacob (Odessa, 1866); and "Bene Reshef", essays and poems, published by [[Peretz Smolenskin]] (Vienna, 1871).

==Collections==
Abraham Firkovich collected several distinct collections of documents. In sum the Firkovich collection contains approximately 15,000 items; of which many are fragmentary.&lt;ref name ="Association"&gt;{{cite book| title = Proceedings of the Annual Convention | publisher = Association of Jewish Libraries | page = 143 | year = 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Odessa Collection===
This collection contains material from the Crimea and the Caucasus. It was largely collected between 1839 and 1840, but with additions from Firkovich as late as 1852.&lt;ref name ="Vasilyeva"&gt;{{cite journal|url = http://ojs.tsv.fi/index.php/StOrE/article/viewFile/41654/10738| title = THE FIRKOVICH ODESSA COLLECTION: THE HISTORY OF ITS ACQUISITION AND RESEARCH, PRESENT CONDITION AND HISTORICAL VALUE | author= Olga Vasilyeva|journal= Studia Orientalia  |volume= 95| page = 45-53| year = 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was originally owned by the Odessa Society of History and Antiquities and was stored in the Odessa museum.&lt;ref name ="Shapira"&gt;{{cite book |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=j7ulQPrfm_cC&amp;pg=PA70&amp;dq=Pinner+Prospectus+1845&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwju-KnFgZ7OAhUHqh4KHdieD0MQ6AEILjAD#v=onepage&amp;q=Pinner%20Prospectus%201845&amp;f=false| title = Avraham Firkowicz in Istanbul: 1830-1832 : Paving the Way for Turkic Nationalism |author= Dan Shapira| publisher = Ayse Demiral| page = 69-70| year = 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name ="Vasilyeva"/&gt;
Some of these documents deteriorated due to chemical treatment performed by Firkovich. Other documents which were suspected forgeries disappeared; Firkovich claimed they had been stolen.&lt;ref name ="Shapira"/&gt; The collection was moved to the Imperial Public Library in 1863.&lt;ref name ="Vasilyeva"/&gt;

In 1844 the Russian historian Arist Kunik, a leading anti-Normanist, and Bezalel Stern, an influential Russian [[Maskil]], would study and partly describe the discovery.&lt;ref name ="Shapira"/&gt;&lt;ref name ="Bak"&gt;{{cite book |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=suJTBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA158&amp;dq=Bezalel+Stern+Maskil&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwitobzNiaHOAhXCNT4KHc2BCSoQ6AEIIjAB#v=onepage&amp;q=Bezalel%20Stern%20Maskil&amp;f=false| title = Manufacturing a Past for the Present: Forgery and Authenticity in Medievalist Texts and Objects in Nineteenth-Century Europe| editors= János M. Bak, Patrick J. Geary, Gábor Klaniczay| publisher = BRILL| page = 158| year = 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Briefly stated, the discoveries include the major part of the manuscripts described in Pinner's "Prospectus der Odessaer Gesellschaft für Geschichte und Alterthum Gehörenden Aeltesten Hebräischen und Rabbinischen Manuscripte" (Odessa, 1845), a rather rare work which is briefly described in "Literaturblatt des Orients" for 1847, No. 2. These manuscripts consist of:

*Fifteen scrolls of the Law, with postscripts which give, in Karaite fashion, the date and place of writing, the name of the writer or corrector or other interesting data.
*Twenty copies of books of the Bible other than the [[Pentateuch]], some complete, others fragmentary, of one of which, the [[Book of Habakkuk]], dated 916, a facsimile is given.
*Nine numbers of Talmudical and rabbinical manuscripts.

===The First Collection===
Contains material from the Crimea and the Caucasus largely collected between 1839 and 1841. It was purchased by the Imperial Public Library in 1862.&lt;ref name ="Goldstein"&gt;{{cite book |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=F9pu1RJKbdkC&amp;pg=PA9&amp;dq=Abraham+Firkovich+1839&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiKhMS9kp7OAhVGWh4KHS93BQsQ6AEINTAE#v=onepage&amp;q=Abraham%20Firkovich%201839&amp;f=false| title = Karaite Exegesis in Medieval Jerusalem|author= Miriam Goldstein| publisher = Mohr Siebeck| page = 9| year = 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name ="Vasilyeva"/&gt;

===The Samaritan Collection===
Another collection of 317 Samaritan manuscripts, acquired in Nablus, arrived in the St. Petersburg Imperial Academy in 1867 (see Fürst, "Geschichte des Karäerthums", iii. pp. 176, Leipsic, 1869)

In 1864 Firkovich acquired a large collection of Samaritan documents in Nablus. He sold the documents to the Imperial Public Library in 1870. In sum the collection contains 1,350 items.&lt;ref name ="Harviainen"&gt;{{cite journal|url = http://ojs.tsv.fi/index.php/StOrE/article/view/41627/10714 | title = The Acquisition of the Samaritan Collection by Abraham Firkovich in Nablus in 1864 -An Additional Document | authors= Tapani Harviainen &amp; Haseeb Shehadeh |journal= Studia Orientalia  |volume= 97| page = 49-63| year = 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Second Collection===
Contains material collected from the Near East. The material was collected between 1863 and 1865. Firkovich collected in Jerusalem, Aleppo and also in Cairo.&lt;ref name ="Goldstein"/&gt; Firkovich concealed where he obtained the documents.&lt;ref name ="BlauReif"&gt;{{cite book |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=LvPPkxj242oC&amp;pg=PA74&amp;dq=Firkovich+conceal+sources&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjH84O5lqPOAhWDbR4KHe1TCHsQ6AEIHDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Firkovich%20conceal%20sources&amp;f=false| title = Genizah Research After Ninety Years: The Case of Judaeo-Arabic

==Forgery Accusations==
Firkovich has come to be regarded as a forger, acting in support of Karaite causes.&lt;ref name ="Astren"&gt;{{cite book |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=mCdpqhKuKqEC&amp;pg=PA188&amp;dq=Firkovich+Karaite&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjz94O7uaPOAhXFmh4KHaU0D5YQ6AEIJTAC#v=onepage&amp;q=Firkovich%20Karaite&amp;f=false | title = Karaite Judaism and Historical Understanding|author= Fred Astren| publisher = Univ of South Carolina Press| pages = 188| year = 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; He wished to eliminate any connection between Rabbinic Judaism and the Karaites by declaring that the Karaites were descendants of the [[Ten Lost Tribes]].&lt;ref name ="Frankel"&gt;{{cite book |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=QIPmCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA33&amp;dq=Firkovich+10+lost+tribes&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiYv87Cs6POAhVLox4KHYp_AIMQ6AEIIDAB#v=onepage&amp;q=Firkovich%2010%20lost%20tribes&amp;f=false| title = Studies in Contemporary Jewry: X: Reshaping the Past: Jewish History and the Historians|author= Jonathan Frankel| publisher = OUP USA/Institute of Contemporary Jewry, Hebrew University of Jerusalem| pages = 33| year = 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; Firkovich successfully petitioned the Russian government to exempt the Karaites from anti-Jewish laws on the grounds that Karaites had immigrated to Europe before the crucifixion of Jesus and thus could not be held responsible for his death.&lt;ref name ="Weinryb"&gt;{{cite book |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=K2DgBdSCQnsC&amp;pg=PA21&amp;dq=Abraham+Firkovich+khazars&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjtgcKp7J3OAhVFHB4KHfIoCVMQ6AEINzAF#v=onepage&amp;q=Abraham%20Firkovich%20khazars&amp;f=false| title = The Jews of Poland: A Social and Economic History of the Jewish Community in Poland from 1100 to 1800 |author= Bernard Dov Weinryb | publisher = Jewish Publication Society| pages = 21-22| year = 1973}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[S. L. Rapoport]] has pointed out some impossibilities in the inscriptions (''[[Ha-Meliẓ]],'' 1861, Nos. 13-15, 37); [[A. Geiger]] in his ''Jüdische Zeitschrift'' (1865, p.&amp;nbsp;166), Schorr in ''He-Ḥaluẓ,'' and [[A. Neubauer]] in the ''Journal Asiatique'' (1862–63) and in his ''Aus der Petersburger Bibliothek'' (Leipzig, 1866) have challenged the correctness of the facts and the theories based upon them which Jost, [[Julius Fürst]], and [[Heinrich Grätz]], in their writings on the Karaites, took from Pinsker's ''Liḳḳuṭe Ḳadmoniyyot,'' in which the data furnished by Firkovich were unhesitatingly accepted. Further exposures were made by Strack and [[Abraham Harkavy|Harkavy]] (St. Petersburg, 1875) in the ''Catalog der Hebr. Bibelhandschriften der Kaiserlichen Oeffentlichen Bibliothek in St. Petersburg''; in Harkavy's ''Altjüdische Denkmäler aus der Krim'' (ib. 1876); in Strack's ''A. Firkowitsch und Seine Entdeckungen'' (Leipsic, 1876); in Fränkel's ''Aḥare Reshet le-Baḳḳer'' (''Ha-Shaḥar,'' vii.646 et seq.); in [[Ephraim Deinard|Deinard]]'s ''Massa' Ḳrim'' (Warsaw, 1878); and in other places. 

In contradiction, Firkovich's most sympathetic critic, Chwolson, gives as a résumé of his belief, after considering all controversies, that Firkovich succeeded in demonstrating that some of the Jewish tombstones from [[Chufut-Kale]] date back to the seventh century, and that seemingly modern forms of eulogy and the method of counting after the era of creation were in vogue among Jews much earlier than had been hitherto suspected. Chwolson alone defended him, but he also was forced to admit that in some cases Firkovich had resorted to forgery. In his ''Corpus Inscriptionum Hebraicarum'' (St. Petersburg, 1882; Russian ed., ib. 1884) Chwolson attempts to prove that the Firkovich collection, especially the epitaphs from tombstones, contains much which is genuine.

In 1980, V. V. Lebedev investigated the Firkovich collection and came to the conclusion that forgery cannot be attributed to Firkovich, but rather it was done by the previous owners, in an attempt to increase the price of the manuscripts.&lt;ref&gt;Лебедев В. В. К источниковедческой оценке некоторых рукописей собрания А. С. Фирковича.// Палестинский сборник. — Л., 1987. Вып. 29 (история и филология). — С. 61.)&lt;/ref&gt;

For many years the manuscripts were not available to Western scholars. The extent of Firkovich’s forgeries is still being determined.&lt;ref name ="Ruderman"&gt;{{cite book |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Z1W0p5B7UgEC&amp;pg=PA149&amp;dq=Abraham+Firkovich+extent+of+forgers&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi71t-WmaHOAhWL2B4KHYLUDsAQ6AEIIzAB#v=onepage&amp;q=Abraham%20Firkovich%20extent%20of%20forgers&amp;f=false| title = Jewish Thought and Scientific Discovery in Early Modern Europe| author = David B. Ruderman| publisher = Wayne State University Press| page = 149| year = 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Firkovich’s materials require careful examination on a case by case basis. His collection remains of great value to scholars of Jewish studies.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="39639">The '''African-American heritage of United States presidents''' relates mostly to questions and claims made by amateur historians as to whether five presidents of the United States who were accepted as white also had significant recent African ancestry. There is no disagreement that President [[Barack Obama]] (2009–2017) had a [[Kenyan]] father and an American mother of mostly European ancestry. (She and Obama are thought also to be descended from the African indentured servant known in colonial records as [[John Punch (slave)|John Punch]].) The academic consensus of historians is that no president other than Obama has had recent (from the [[Colonial history of the United States|colonial period in U.S. history]] or after) African ancestry; it rejects claims to the contrary.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

== Background ==
These claims have been made by the historian [[William Estabrook Chancellor]], amateur historian [[J. A. Rogers]], [[ophthalmologist]] Leroy William Vaughn,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.computerhealth.org/ebook/ Dr. Leroy Vaughn, ''Black People &amp; Their Place in History''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090124021521/http://www.computerhealth.org/ebook/ |date=January 24, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Auset BaKhufu. All but Chancellor base their theories chiefly on the work of J. A. Rogers, who apparently self-published a pamphlet in 1965 claiming that five presidents of the United States, widely accepted as white, also had African ancestry.&lt;ref&gt;Rogers, J. A., ''The Five Negro Presidents: According to What White People Said They Were'' (St. Petersburg, Fla.: Helga M. Rogers, 1965; {{ISBN|0-9602294-8-5}}).&lt;/ref&gt; Vaughn's and BaKhufu's books also appear to have been self-published.&lt;ref name="haynes"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/08036/854713-51.stm|title=Racial heritage of six former presidents is questioned|last=Haynes|first=Monica|date=February 5, 2008|work=[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]]|quote="Virtually, all we know came from J.A.

Historians' and biographers' studies of these presidents have not supported such claims, nor have the claims been published in any peer-reviewed journal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Barack Obama is Not the First "Black President"

These sources together claim six American Presidents who were believed to have had "Black blood": Thomas Jefferson, Andrew Jackson, Abraham Lincoln, Warren Harding, Calvin Coolidge, and Dwight David Eisenhower. These sources, however, do not offer compelling empirical evidence to support their claims.

== Significance of claims ==
{{See also|Slavery in the United States}}

Citizenship and associated claims have split on two dimensions: formal legal citizenship, and full social and political citizenship. While claims of African ancestry may have created social scandal (and that varied in time and place), even in Thomas Jefferson's time, a person of less than one-quarter African ancestry could be considered legally white. Later this was changed so that a person had to have at least seven-eighths European ancestry to be legally white. Jefferson's mixed-race children from his relationship with [[Sally Hemings]], were seven-eighths white.&lt;ref&gt;Annette Gordon-Reed, ''The Hemingses of Monticello: An American Family'', New York: W.W. Norton &amp; Company, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; There is ample evidence in historical records that people of mixed race were accepted as white and full citizens in communities, as they were documented as exercising the rights of citizens to bear arms and vote.  Social acceptance by the majority-white community was often the key as to whether a person was considered white, more than details about ancestry, especially in early periods on the frontier when few records were kept and people often did not know much about their origins.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.historycooperative.org/journals/lhr/25.3/gross.html Ariela Gross, "Of Portuguese Origin": Litigating Identity and Citizenship among the "Little Races" in Nineteenth-Century America"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080512143936/http://www.historycooperative.org/journals/lhr/25.3/gross.html |date=2008-05-12 }}, ''Law and History Review'', Vol. 25 (3), Fall 2007, accessed June 22, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

This classification of ancestry and social class was separate from the legal status derived from ''[[partus sequitur ventrem]]'', the law that made children born to slave mothers also slaves. This law hardened slavery as a racial caste system. But, it was not until after the end of slavery and regaining of power by conservative whites in the late 19th-century [[South]] that they passed laws to create racial [[Racial segregation|segregation]] and [[Jim Crow laws|Jim Crow]]. From 1890 to 1908, southern states of the former Confederacy passed constitutional amendments and legislation making voter registration more difficult, essentially [[Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era (United States)|disfranchising]] most blacks and tens of thousands of poor whites.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Perman, ''Struggle for Mastery:Disfranchisement in the South, 1888–1908'', Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Glenn Feldman, '' The Disfranchisement Myth: Poor Whites and Suffrage Restriction in Alabama'', Athens, GA: University of Georgia Press, 2004, p. 136.&lt;/ref&gt; Such disfranchisement essentially lasted until the civil rights movement gained Congressional passage of the [[Voting Rights Act of 1965]] to protect constitutional rights of citizens to vote.

In the early 20th century, southern states tried to find more ways to enforce [[Racial segregation|segregation]]. Beginning with Tennessee in 1910, through Oklahoma in 1931, most southern states adopted the [[one-drop rule]], and hardened racial lines so that a person of any African ancestry was to be recorded as and considered as black in the binary society. During the same period, [[Florida]], [[Indiana]], [[Kentucky]], [[Maryland]], [[Missouri]], [[Nebraska]], [[North Dakota]], and [[Utah]] retained their old "blood fraction" statutes ''[[de jure]]'', but amended these fractions (one-sixteenth, one-thirty-second) to be equivalent to one-drop ''[[de facto]].''&lt;ref&gt;Pauli Murray (ed.), ''States’ Laws on Race and Color'' (Athens, 1997), 428, 173, 443, 37, 237, 330, 463, 22, 39, 358, 77, 150, 164, 207, 254, 263, 459.&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent decades, United States historians have more thoroughly explored the years of slavery and opened up discussion of race relations. They have noted that numerous mixed-race families of varying proportions of European and African ancestry developed in colonial and antebellum United States. In award-winning research, Paul Heinegg traced the ancestry of free black families in [[North Carolina]] in the 1790 census, finding that most were descended from [[free people of color]] in colonial [[Virginia]] who migrated to other areas. They were mostly descendants of unions between white women, indentured servant or free, and African men, slave, indentured or free, from years when associations among the working class were fluid.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.freeafricanamericans.com/ Paul Heinegg, ''Free African Americans of Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Maryland and Delaware''], 1998–2005, February 15, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; The historian Dr. [[Ira Berlin]] praised Heinegg's "meticulous research" in his Foreword to his work.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2004/01/08/garden/08TREE.html?ei=5007&amp;en=63e82ae43d2f66c6&amp;ex=1388898000&amp;partner=USERLAND&amp;pagewanted=all&amp;position= Mitchell Owens, "Surprises in the Family Tree"], ''The New York Times'', January 8, 2004, accessed July 30, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Because the white women were free, their mixed-race children were born free.{{Citation needed|date=April 2015}}

[[Nell Irvin Painter]] examined issues of power in ''Southern History Across the Color Line'' (2002). Joshua Rothman looked closely at antebellum Virginia and numerous mixed-race families in ''Notorious in the Neighborhood: Sex and Families across the Color Line in Virginia, 1787–1861'' (2003). In two books, the scholar [[Annette Gordon-Reed]] showed how historians had ignored evidence of [[Thomas Jefferson]]'s and [[Sally Hemings]]' long affair and mixed-race children, who were seven-eighths white. In her deep research, however, she did not support claims that Jefferson was of mixed-race descent. [[Jefferson-Hemings controversy|DNA studies]] in 1998 showed a match between the Jefferson male line and a descendant of [[Eston Hemings]], leading experts to conclude that Jefferson was likely the father of Hemings' children.  The Thomas Jefferson Foundation agrees that the weight of historical evidence supports this conclusion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.monticello.org/plantation/hemingscontro/reportstatement.html |title=Statement on the TJF Research Committee Report on Thomas Jefferson and Sally Hemings |author=Jordan, Daniel P. |publisher=Monticello Foundation |accessdate=2008-07-27 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080608234107/http://www.monticello.org/plantation/hemingscontro/reportstatement.html |archivedate=2008-06-08 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

None of the claims below have been verified by reliable sources in peer-reviewed publications. Mainline historians do not support these claims.

==== Thomas Jefferson ====
Vaughn and others claim [[early life and career of Thomas Jefferson#Jeffersons of Virginia|Thomas Jefferson]]'s mother [[Jane Randolph Jefferson]] was of mixed-race ancestry.&lt;ref name=haynes/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hussain"&gt;{{cite news |first=Aysha  |last=Hussain |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Obama Won't Be First Black President |url=http://northdallasgazette.com/archives/2009/01-15-09_edition.pdf |quote=Were there other "black" presidents? Some historians have reason to believe people don't really understand the genealogy of past U.S. Presidents. Research shows at least five U.S. presidents had black ancestors and Thomas Jefferson, the nation's third president, was considered the first black president, according to historian Leroy Vaughn, author of ''Black People and Their Place in World History''. Vaughn's research shows Jefferson was not the only former black U.S. president. Who were the others? Andrew Jackson, Abraham Lincoln, Warren Harding and Calvin Coolidge. But why was this unknown? How were they elected president? All five of these presidents never acknowledged their black ancestry. |work=North Dallas Gazette (published from ''Diversity'' original from 2008) |year=2009 |accessdate=2016-01-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The academic consensus does not support such claims. In her recent analyses of historical evidence about the Hemings and Jeffersons, for example, the scholar Annette Gordon-Reed makes no claim of African descent in the Randolph family.&lt;ref&gt;Annette Gordon-Reed, ''The Hemingses of Monticello'' and ''Thomas Jefferson and Sally Hemings''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Specifically, Vaughn says, "The chief attack on Jefferson was in a book written by Thomas Hazard in 1867 called ''The Johnny Cake Papers''.  Hazard interviewed Paris Gardiner, who said he was present during the 1796 presidential campaign, when one speaker states that Thomas Jefferson was a mean-spirited son of a half-breed Indian squaw and a Virginia mulatto father."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Leroy William Vaughn |coauthors= |title=Black People and Their Place in History |year=2002 |publisher=Lulu.com |quote= | url= |isbn=0-9715920-0-4 |page=142}}&lt;/ref&gt; An overlapping claim is that, in an 18th-century Presidential campaign, someone speaking against Jefferson's candidacy and in favor of that of [[John Adams]] accused Jefferson of being "half Injun, half nigger, half Frenchman"&lt;ref name="Nock-Jefferson-p141"&gt;[[Albert Jay Nock|Nock, Albert Jay]], ''Jefferson'' (N.Y.: Hill &amp; Wang (American Century ser.), 1st Am.

Vaughn also quoted biographer Samuel Sloan's statement that there was "something strange" about Thomas Jefferson's reportedly destroying papers and personal effects of his mother [[Jane Randolph Jefferson]] after her death. That is the extent of his evidence.

The [[Thomas Jefferson Foundation]], which owns and operates [[Monticello]], the major public history site on Jefferson, characterizes Jefferson's parents this way: "His father Peter Jefferson was a successful planter and surveyor and his mother Jane Randolph a member of one of Virginia's most distinguished families."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.monticello.org/jefferson/biography.html |title=Brief Biography of Thomas Jefferson (1743–1826) |accessdate=2009-01-31 |quote= |publisher=Monticello Foundation |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080801045437/http://www.monticello.org/jefferson/biography.html |archivedate=2008-08-01 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; They describe the quote in ''The Johnny Cake Papers'' as one frequently repeated, but it is attributed in written sources to the 1800 rather than the 1796 election campaign and clearly is one made by political opponents. ''The Johnny Cake Papers'' were a collection of folk tales published in 1879, not 1867, and only one tale commented on Jefferson.  The Foundation states:

&lt;blockquote&gt;To date we have not found this quotation in any sources contemporary to the election of 1800. Its earliest known appearance in print is actually in a collection of New England folk tales, ''The Johnny-Cake Papers''. First published in 1879, the stories told date in many cases back to the beginning of the 19th century, while others are thought to be even older.  The reference in question appears in the "Seventeenth Baking," in which a "most veracious stump orator from Providence" spoke expansively on the achievements of [president] John Adams,

* "...the profound and fearless patriot and full-blooded Yankee, [who] exceeded in every possible respect his competitor, Tom Jefferson, for the Presidency, who, to make the best of him, was nothing but a mean-spirited, low-lived fellow, the son of a half-breed Indian squaw, sired by a Virginia mulatto father, as was well known in the neighborhood where he was raised, wholly on hoe-cake (made of course-ground Southern corn), bacon, and hominy, with an occasional change of fricasseed bullfrog, for which abominable reptiles he had acquired a taste during his residence among the French in Paris, to whom there could be no question he would sell his country at the first offer made to him cash down, should he be elected to fill the Presidential chair."

[[Dixon Wecter]], in his essay "Thomas Jefferson, The Gentle Radical," discusses various portrayals of Jefferson by his political enemies, and mentions that "the Jonnycake [sic] Papers later burlesqued such caricatures..."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wiki.monticello.org/mediawiki/index.php/%22Son_of_a_half-breed_Indian_squaw...%22 |title=Son of a half-breed Indian squaw... |accessdate=2009-01-31 |quote= |publisher=Monticello Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Efn|[[Providence, Rhode Island]], the capital and most populous city of the state}}{{Efn|[[Yankee]]s, people from the northeastern U.S. (the term is sometimes an insult)}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The rumors may have been sustained by a statement Harding allegedly made to newspaperman [[James W. Faulkner]] on the subject, which he perhaps meant to be dismissive: "How do I know, Jim?

==His relations with others==
Abolhassani was one of disciples of Sheikh Hossein Lankarani. He was associated with Sheikh Hossein Lankarani for many years and was very influenced by him. Abolhassani had great interest to Sheikh Fazlullah Nuri that led to his fascination with the Sheikh and had authoring several books. Abolhassani's opinion about Doctor Mosaddeq was positive but about Doctor Shariati was nasty and extremely protested about him and this led to his disciples have such views. Abolhassani was published Morteza Motahhari's notes against Ali Shariati for the first time in 1984.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.partosokhan.ir/page.asp?Number=622&amp;Category=400|title=نشريه پرتوي سخن|author=|date= |website=  |publisher= |language=Persian |accessdate=19 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=J5RGlpx0j8sC&amp;pg=PA483&amp;dq=ali+monzer&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=-C8EUdWEIoK88wSsp4C4Ag&amp;ved=0CDAQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Debating Muslims: Cultural Dialogues in Postmodernity and Tradition|author=|date= |website=  |publisher= |language=Persian |accessdate=19 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tabnak.ir/pages/?cid=5791|title=چرخش‌ها در جمهوري اسلامي نسبت به شريعتي|author=|date= |website=  |publisher= |language=Persian |accessdate=19 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Alma Söderhjelm''' (10 May 1870 – 16 March 1949) was a [[Swedish-speaking Finns|Swedish-speaking]] [[Finland|Finnish]] historian and the first female professor in Finland.

== Academic career ==

After gaining an M.A. in history, Söderhjelm spent 3 years in Paris, preparing her doctoral thesis. This was a study of journalism during the French Revolution and it was published as ''Le Régime de la presse pendant la Révolution française''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/lergimedelapre01sduoft  Le Régime de la presse pendant la Révolution française (1901)].&lt;/ref&gt; 
She was awarded a doctorate in 1900.

On the basis of this thesis, the university unanimously proposed to award her a lectureship. This appointment was delayed until 1906, because of political concern over her father and her brother. The Emperor was also concerned that if a woman became a lecturer in Finland, the same demand would be made in Russia.

In 1906 she finally became the first female lecturer in Finland. She stayed in this position until 1927. At this point, she became chair of General History at Åbo Akademi University, and thus the first female professor in Finland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Söderhjelm, Alma (1870 - 1949)|url=http://www.kansallisbiografia.fi/english/?id=2852|accessdate=20 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her academic work also involved editing the correspondence of the [[Marie Antoinette|French Queen Marie Antoinette]] with the Swedish nobleman von Fersen and with some French revolutionaries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.helsinki.fi/akka-info/tiedenaiset/english/soderhjelm.html Women of Learning]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Other activities ==

Söderhjelm worked as a journalist, writing a column for the newspaper ''[[Åbo Underrättelser]]''. She also wrote novels, poetry, and a five-volume memoir.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bibbild.abo.fi/hands/Soderhjelm/index.htm|title=Alma Söderhjelms Samling}}&lt;/ref&gt;
She co-wrote the screenplay for ''[[The Blizzard (1923 film)|The Blizzard]]'' (1923), directed by [[Mauritz Stiller]].

Söderhjelm was politically active. She smuggled journals into Finland from Sweden, and helped military volunteers to move from Sweden into Germany.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kansallisbiografia.fi/english/?id=2852 Söderhjelm, Alma (1870 - 1949)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prehistoric transport and trade==
[[Epipaleolithic]] [[Natufian culture|Natufian]]s carried [[parthenocarpic]] [[ficus|fig]]s from [[Africa]] to the southeastern corner of the [[Fertile Crescent]], c. 10,000 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kislev | first1 = ME | last2 = Hartmann | first2 = A | last3 = Bar-Yosef | first3 = O | year = 2006 | title = Early domesticated fig in the Jordan Valley | url = | journal = Science | volume = 312 | issue = 5778| pages = 1372–1374 | doi=10.1126/science.1125910 | pmid=16741119| bibcode = 2006Sci...312.1372K }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Later [[Demic diffusion|migrations]] out of the [[Fertile Crescent]] would carry early [[Agriculture|agricultural]] practices to neighboring regions—westward to [[Europe]] and [[North Africa]], northward to [[Crimean Peninsula|Crimea]], and eastward to [[Mongolia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Chicki | first1 = L | last2 = Nichols | first2 = RA | last3 = Barbujani | first3 = G | last4 = Beaumont | first4 = MA | year = 2002 | title = Y genetic data support the Neolithic demic diffusion model| doi = 10.1073/pnas.162158799 | journal = Proc.

The ancient people of the [[Sahara]] imported domesticated animals from [[Asia]] between 6000 and 4000 BCE.  In [[Nabta Playa]] by the end of the [[7th millennium BCE]], [[Predynastic Egypt|prehistoric Egyptians]] had imported [[goat]]s and [[sheep]] from [[Southwest Asia]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.comp-archaeology.org/WendorfSAA98.html  Fred Wendorf and Romuald Schild, 2000.  ''Late Neolithic megalithic structures at Nabta Playa (Sahara), southwestern Egypt''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080213000000/http://www.comp-archaeology.org/WendorfSAA98.html |date=2008-02-13 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Foreign [[Cultural artifact|artifact]]s dating to the [[5th millennium BCE]] in the [[Badarian]] culture in [[Predynastic Egypt|Egypt]] indicate contact with distant [[Syria]]. In [[predynastic Egypt]], by the beginning of the [[4th millennium BCE]], [[ancient Egyptian]]s in [[Maadi]] were importing [[pottery]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalegypt.ucl.ac.uk/neolithic/maadi.html |title=Maadi Culture |publisher=Digitalegypt.ucl.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2011-07-13| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110629145556/http://www.digitalegypt.ucl.ac.uk/neolithic/maadi.html| archivedate= 29 June 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as [[construction]] ideas from [[Canaan]].

By the [[4th millennium BCE]] [[shipping]] was well established, and the [[donkey]] and possibly the [[dromedary]] had been domesticated. Domestication of the [[Bactrian camel]] and use of the [[horse]] for [[transport]] then followed. Charcoal samples found in the tombs of [[Nekhen]], which were dated to the [[Naqada]] I and II periods, have been identified as [[Cedrus libani|cedar]] from [[Lebanon]].&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Predynastic Egypt]]ians of the [[Naqada|Naqada I period]] also imported [[obsidian]] from [[History of Ethiopia|Ethiopia]], used to shape [[blade]]s and other objects from [[Lithic flake|flake]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Barbara G.

By the second half of the 4th millennium BCE, the gemstone [[lapis lazuli]] was being traded from its only known source in the ancient world—[[Badakhshan]], in what is now northeastern [[Afghanistan]]—as far as [[Mesopotamia]] and [[Egypt]]. By the 3rd millennium BCE, the lapis lazuli trade was extended to [[Harappa]], [[Lothal]] and [[Mohenjo-daro]] in the [[Indus Valley Civilization]] of modern-day [[Pakistan]] and northwestern India. The Indus Valley was also known as [[Meluhha]], the earliest [[Indian maritime history|maritime]] trading partner of the [[Sumer]]ians and [[Akkadian Empire|Akkadians]] in Mesopotamia.  The ancient harbor constructed in [[Lothal]], India, around 2400 BCE is the oldest [[shipbuilding|seafaring]] harbour known.&lt;ref name="RaoQ"&gt;{{Cite book

==Trans-Saharan trade==
{{main|Trans-Saharan trade}}

The overland route through the [[Wadi Hammamat]] from the [[Nile]] to the [[Red Sea]] was known as early as [[Predynastic Egypt|predynastic]] times;&lt;ref name="WadiTrade"&gt;Please refer to [[Wadi Hammamat#Trade route]].&lt;/ref&gt; drawings depicting Egyptian [[reed boat]]s have been found along the path dating to 4000 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;Please refer to [[Wadi Hammamat#Carvings]].&lt;/ref&gt;  Ancient [[City|cities]] dating to the [[First Dynasty of Egypt]] arose along both its Nile and [[Red Sea]] junctions,&lt;ref name="WadiTrade" /&gt; testifying to the route's ancient popularity.  It became a major route from [[Thebes, Egypt|Thebes]] to the Red Sea port of [[Elim (Bible)|Elim]], where travelers then moved on to either Asia, Arabia or the [[Horn of Africa]].&lt;ref name="WadiTrade" /&gt;  Records exist documenting knowledge of the route among [[Senusret I]], Seti, [[Ramesses IV]] and also, later, the [[Roman Empire]], especially for mining.&lt;ref&gt;Please refer to [[Wadi Hammamat#Quarries]] and [[Wadi Hammamat#Common era]].&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Kharga Oasis|Darb el-Arbain]] trade route, passing through [[Kharga]] in the south and [[Asyut]] in the north, was used from as early as the [[Old Kingdom of Egypt]] for the transport and trade of gold, [[ivory trade|ivory]], spices, wheat, animals and plants.&lt;ref&gt;Jobbins, Jenny.  "The 40 days' nightmare," in ''Al-Ahram,'' 13–19 November 2003, Issue No. 664.  Published in Cairo, Egypt.&lt;/ref&gt;  Later, [[Ancient Rome|Ancient Roman]]s would protect the route by lining it with varied forts and small outposts, some guarding large settlements complete with cultivation.&lt;ref&gt;Please refer to [[Kharga Oasis]].&lt;/ref&gt;  Described by [[Herodotus]] as a road "traversed ... in forty days," it became by his time an important land route facilitating trade between [[Nubia]] and Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Dr. Stuart Tyson.

Retrieved January 21, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;  Its maximum extent was northward from [[Kobbei]], 25 miles north of [[al-Fashir]], passing through the desert, through Bir Natrum and [[Wadi Howar]], and ending in Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;Burr, J. Millard and Robert O. Collins, ''Darfur: The Long Road to Disaster'', Markus Wiener Publishers: Princeton, 2006, {{ISBN|1-55876-405-4}}, pp. 6–7.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Maritime trade==
[[Shipbuilding]] was known to the Ancient Egyptians as early as 3000 BCE,&lt;ref name="AIA"&gt;Ward, Cheryl.  "[http://www.archaeology.org/0105/abstracts/abydos3.html World's Oldest Planked Boats]", in ''[[Archaeology (magazine)|Archaeology]]'' (Volume 54, Number 3, May/June 2001).

[[Archaeological Institute of America]].&lt;/ref&gt; and perhaps earlier.&lt;ref name="AIA2" /&gt;  Ancient Egyptians knew how to assemble planks of wood into a [[hull (ship)|ship hull]], with woven straps used to lash the planks together,&lt;ref name="AIA" /&gt; and [[Cyperus papyrus|reeds]] or grass stuffed between the planks helped to seal the seams.&lt;ref name="AIA" /&gt;  The [[Archaeological Institute of America]] reports&lt;ref name="AIA" /&gt; that the earliest dated ship—75 feet long, dating to 3000 BCE&lt;ref name="AIA2" /&gt;—may have possibly belonged to [[Hor-Aha|Pharaoh Aha]].&lt;ref name="AIA2" /&gt;

An Egyptian colony stationed in southern [[Canaan]] dates to slightly before the First Dynasty.&lt;ref&gt;Naomi Porat and Edwin van den Brink (editor), "An Egyptian Colony in Southern Palestine During the Late Predynastic to Early Dynastic," in ''The Nile Delta in Transition:  4th to 3rd Millennium BC'' (1992), pp. 433–440.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Narmer]] had Egyptian pottery produced in Canaan—with his name stamped on vessels—and exported back to Egypt,&lt;ref name="Naomi"&gt;Naomi Porat, "Local Industry of Egyptian Pottery in Southern Palestine During the Early Bronze I Period," in ''Bulletin of the Egyptological, Seminar 8'' (1986/1987), pp. 109–129.  See also [http://www.digitalegypt.ucl.ac.uk/foreignrelations/1stdynegyppotsinpalestine.html University College London web post, 2000].&lt;/ref&gt; from regions such as [[Tel Arad|Arad]], [[Besor|En Besor]], [[Rafah|Rafiah]], and [[Tel Erani]].&lt;ref name="Naomi" /&gt;  In 1994 excavators discovered an incised ceramic [[sherd|shard]] with the [[serekh]] sign of Narmer, dating to c. 3000 BCE. Mineralogical studies reveal the shard to be a fragment of a wine jar exported from the Nile valley to [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]].
Due to Egypt's climate, wine was very rare and nearly impossible to produce within the limits of Egypt. In order to obtain wine, Egyptians had to import it from Greece, Phoenicia, and Palestine. These early friendships played a key role in Egypt's ability to conduct trade and acquire goods that were needed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Homan|first1=Michael|title=Beer and Its Drinkers: An Ancient near Eastern Love Story|journal=Near Eastern Archaeology|volume=67|issue=2|page=87|doi=10.2307/4132364|jstor=4132364|year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:FuneraryPaddlingBoatW-TombOfMeketre MetropolitanMuseum.png|thumb|right|200px|Model of a paddling funerary boat from the tomb of [[Meketre]]. From the time of the [[Twelfth dynasty of Egypt]], early in the reign of [[Amenemhat I]], circa 1931–1975 BCE.]]

The [[Palermo stone]] mentions King [[Sneferu]] of the [[Fourth dynasty of Egypt|4th Dynasty]] sending ships to import high-quality [[Cedrus libani|cedar]] from [[Lebanon]]. In one scene in the pyramid of Pharaoh [[Sahure]] of the [[Fifth dynasty of Egypt|Fifth Dynasty]], Egyptians are returning with huge cedar trees. Sahure's name is found stamped on a thin piece of gold on a [[Lebanon]] chair, and 5th dynasty [[cartouche]]s were found in Lebanon stone vessels. Other scenes in his temple depict [[Syria]]n bears. The [[Palermo stone]] also mentions expeditions to [[Sinai Peninsula|Sinai]] as well as to the [[diorite]] quarries northwest of [[Abu Simbel]].

The oldest known expedition to the [[Land of Punt]] was organized by Sahure, which apparently yielded a quantity of [[myrrh]], along with [[malachite]] and [[electrum]]. Around 1950 BCE, in the reign of [[Mentuhotep III]], an officer named [[Hennu]] made one or more voyages to Punt. In the 15th century BCE, [[Nehsi]] conducted a very famous expedition for Queen [[Hatshepsut]] to obtain [[myrrh]]; a report of that voyage survives on a relief in Hatshepsut's funerary temple at [[Deir el-Bahri]]. Several of her successors, including [[Thutmoses III]], also organized expeditions to Punt.

==Canal construction==
{{Main|Canal of the Pharaohs}}
The legendary [[Sesostris]] (likely either Pharaoh [[Senusret II]] or [[Senusret III]] of the [[Twelfth dynasty of Egypt]]&lt;ref&gt;Please refer to [[Sesostris#Modern research]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[J. H. Breasted]] attributes the ancient canal's early construction to [[Senusret III]], up through the first cataract.  Please refer to J. H. Breasted, ''[[Ancient Records of Egypt]]'', Part One, Chicago 1906, &amp;sect;&amp;sect;642-648&lt;/ref&gt;) is said to have started work on an ancient [[Suez Canal|"Suez" Canal]]  joining the [[River Nile]] with the [[Red Sea]].  This ancient account is corroborated by [[Aristotle]], [[Pliny the Elder]], and [[Strabo]].&lt;ref&gt;Please refer to [[Suez Canal#2nd millennium BC]].&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;One of their kings tried to make a canal to it (for it would have been of no little advantage to them for the whole region to have become navigable; Sesostris is said to have been the first of the ancient kings to try), but he found that the sea was higher than the land. So he first, and Darius afterwards, stopped making the canal, lest the sea should mix with the river water and spoil it.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, '''[[Meteorology (Aristotle)|Meteorology]]''' (1.15) [http://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/a/aristotle/meteorology/book1.html]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;165. Next comes the Tyro tribe and, on the Red Sea, the harbour of the Daneoi, from which Sesostris, king of Egypt, intended to carry a ship-canal to where the Nile flows into what is known as the Delta; this is a distance of over 60 miles. Later the Persian king Darius had the same idea, and yet again Ptolemy II, who made a trench 100 feet wide, 30 feet deep and about 35 miles long, as far as the Bitter Lakes.&lt;ref&gt;[[Pliny the Elder|The Elder Pliny]] and John Healey ''Natural History'' (6.33.165)  Penguin Classics; Reprint edition (5 February 2004) {{ISBN|978-0-14-044413-1}}  p.70 [https://books.google.com/books?id=JvyF-8NXFbIC&amp;pg=PA70&amp;lpg=PA70&amp;dq=Pliny+the+elder+sesostris+canal&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=t1np0DY4S3&amp;sig=i0wzXRGizdz6DK8e6CTGA1wFcoI&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=BieVSv3GE-PKjAfU-OnnDQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=7#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:Dacier, Bon-Joseph.jpg|thumb|Bon-Joseph Dacier]]
'''Bon Joseph Dacier''' ([[Valognes]], 1 April 1742 – Paris, 4 February 1833) was a French historian, philologist and translator of ancient Greek. He became a [[Chevalier de l'Empire]]&lt;ref name="UniversitéGeorgel"&gt;[http://www.euraldic.com/txt_bs1870_scien.html Source : Armorial de l'Empire français – par M. Alcide Georgel – 1870.

He also served as curator of the [[Bibliothèque nationale de France|Bibliothèque nationale]].

==Biography==
After studying at the [[collège d'Harcourt]], he became the student and assistant of [[Étienne Lauréault de Foncemagne]]. Dacier came to public notice in 1772 via his translation of the ''Histories'' of [[Claudius Aelianus]] and the same year became an associate member of the [[Académie des inscriptions]], becoming its president and permanent secretary in 1782. In that position, he wrote the organisation's history from 1784 to 1830. He translated the ''[[Cyropaedia]]'' by [[Xenophon]] (1777). He became a member of Paris's corps municipal in 1790 and led the imposition of the new system of [[contributions directes]], but refused [[Louis XVI]]'s offer of the post of finance minister. After retiring to [[Seine-et-Oise]] during the [[French Revolution]], he became a member of the [[Tribunat]] in 1799. In 1800 he was made curator of manuscripts at the [[Bibliothèque nationale de France|Bibliothèque nationale]] and elected to the [[Académie des Sciences morales et politiques]].

It was to Dacier that [[Jean-François Champollion|Champollion]] sent his [http://fr.wikisource.org/wiki/Lettre_%C3%A0_M._Dacier_relative_%C3%A0_l%27alphabet_des_hi%C3%A9roglyphes_phon%C3%A9tiques famous 1822 letter], known widely as ''[[Lettre à M. Dacier]]'', revealing his discovery of how to decipher [[Egyptian hieroglyphics]]. At age 80, Dacier was elected to the [[Académie française]] in 1822; at the time he was the oldest member of the society. He was made a baron on 26 May 1830. [[Pierre-François Tissot]], his successor in the Académie, said of him that "he had the sanest ideas on scholarship, and he unceasingly tended to give it a useful and philosophical direction. "Don't look for gold mines" he said to his brother-academicians and especially to their young emulators. [ ... ] Nothing could be more dangerous than his elogies; they were believed like an epigram by [[Pierre-Antoine Lebrun|Lebrun]]. On the other hand, he liked to support the development of talent; after having the good luck of having found something, his greatest pleasure was to bring it to public light."&lt;ref&gt;Cited by Tyrtée Tastet, ''Histoire des quarante fauteuils de l'Académie française depuis la fondation jusqu'à nos jours, 1635–1855'', volume IV, pp. 194-5 (1855)&lt;/ref&gt; Biographic notice n° 124, devoted to him on page 118 of ''Le premier siècle de l'Institut de France'' (1895), gives his name as "DACIER (Le Baron Bon, Joseph)". He is buried in the [[cimetière du Père-Lachaise]] (29th Division, 4th line, S, 33).

==Main works==
Journals edited by Bon Joseph Dacier included the ''[[Journal des savants|Journal des sçavans]]'', and he also wrote on the history of the [[Order of Saint Lazarus]] (of which he was a member). He also wrote several historical articles.

The calendar is largely based on an older version of the [[Hindu calendar]] though unlike the Indian systems, it employs a version of the [[Metonic cycle]]. The calendar therefore has to reconcile the [[sidereal year]]s of the Hindu calendar with Metonic cycle's tropical years by adding [[intercalary month]]s and [[leap day|intercalary days]] on irregular intervals.

Although the name ''Culāsakaraj'' is a generic term meaning "Lesser Era" in [[Pali]], the term ''Chula Sakarat'' is often associated with the various versions of the calendar used in regions that make up modern-day [[Thailand]]. The calendar is used in [[Myanmar]] and the [[Xishuangbanna|Sipsong Panna]] area of China.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tai12.com&lt;/ref&gt; In Thailand, it is only used in academia for [[History of Thailand|Thai history studies]].

==Etymology==
The name Chula Sakarat is a [[calque|loan translation]] from the Thai, which itself is derived from Pali ''culā'' "small" and Sanskrit ''śaka'' + ''rāja'', literally meaning "[[Scythian]] king" (the meaning was thought and held to be "era" by some of those having adopted the [[Greater India|Indianised culture]] in [[Indochina]], including the Thais).&lt;ref&gt;[[#rit|Busyakul 2004]]: 473.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Thailand, this era is used in contrast with the [[Shalivahana era]], commonly known in Southeast Asia as ''Mahāsakaraj'' or the Great or Major Era ({{lang-my|မဟာ သက္ကရာဇ်}}, {{IPA-my|məhà θɛʔkəɹɪʔ|}}; {{lang-th|มหาศักราช}}; {{RTGS|''Mahasakkarat''}}).

==History==
The calendar was launched in 640 CE in [[Sri Ksetra Kingdom]] (in modern [[Myanmar]]) with the epochal year 0 date of 22 March 638. It was largely a recalibration of then prevailing [[Shalivahana era|Mahasakaraj or Saka Era]]. It was later adopted by the [[Pagan Kingdom]].&lt;ref name=mat-35&gt;Aung-Thwin 2005: 35&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Chiang Mai Chronicles and the Chiang Saen Chronicles, Chiang Mai, Chiang Saen and their tributary states of middle and upper Tai country (except Lamphun and Sukhothai) submitted to King [[Anawrahta]] and adopted the calendar in the mid-11th century in place of Mahasakaraj, the standard calendar of the [[Khmer Empire]].&lt;ref name=oiei-375-376&gt;Oriental 1900: 375–376&lt;/ref&gt; However, scholarship says the earliest evidence of Burmese calendar in modern Thailand dates only to mid-13th century.&lt;ref name=jce-1989-11&gt;Eade 1989: 11&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of the calendar appears to have spread southward to the [[Sukhothai Kingdom|Sukhothai]] and eastward to Laotian states in the following centuries.&lt;ref name="oiei-375-376"&gt;Oriental 1900: 375–376&lt;/ref&gt; The official adoption farther south by the [[Ayutthaya Kingdom]] and farther east by [[Lan Xang]] came only after King [[Bayinnaung]]'s conquests of those kingdoms in the 16th century. Subsequent Siamese kingdoms retained the Burmese calendar as the official calendar under the name of ''Chula Sakarat'' (Culasakaraj) until 1889.&lt;ref name=rbs-11&gt;Smith 1966: 11&lt;/ref&gt;

The calendar fell out of use throughout the region in the second half of the 19th century with the advent of European colonialism. The only remaining independent state Siam too dropped the calendar on 1 April 1889 per King [[Chulalongkorn]] ([[Rama (Kings of Thailand)|Rama]] V)'s decree. It was replaced by [[Thai solar calendar#Rattanakosin Era|Rattanakosin Era]]. Today, the calendar is used purely for cultural and religious festivals in Myanmar. Thailand has moved on to its own version of Buddhist calendar since 1941 although the Chula Sakarat era dates remain the most commonly used and preferred form of entry by the academia for Thai history studies.&lt;ref name=jce-1989-11&gt;Eade 1989: 11&lt;/ref&gt;

==Differences==

===Nomenclature===

====Month numbering====
Various regional versions of Chula Sakarat/Burmese calendar existed across various regions of mainland Southeast Asia. Unlike Burmese systems, [[Xishuangbanna|Sipsong Panna]], Kengtung, Lan Na, Lan Xang and Sukhothai systems refer to the months by numbers, not by names . This means reading ancient texts and inscriptions in Thailand requires constant vigilance, not just in making sure one is correctly operating for the correct region, but also for variations within regions itself when incursions cause a variation in practice.&lt;ref name=jce-1989-9-10&gt;Eade 1989: 9–10&lt;/ref&gt; However, Cambodian (Khmer) month system, which begins with Margasirsa as the first month, demonstrated precisely by the names and numbers.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cam-cc.org/calendar/chhankitek.php&lt;/ref&gt;

====Animal names====
Cambodian and Thai systems give animal names to the years from a cycle of 12.&lt;ref name=jce-1995-22&gt;Eade 1995: 22&lt;/ref&gt; The practice also existed in Burma&lt;ref name=ghl-2-330&gt;Luce 1970: 330&lt;/ref&gt; but had died out by the 17th century. In March 1638, King [[Thalun]] of Burma rejected the proposal by King [[Prasat Thong]] of Siam to change the animal names of the calendar months because the animal naming system was no longer in use in Burma.&lt;ref name=rs-70&gt;Rong 1986: 70&lt;/ref&gt;

===Calculation methodology===
Chula Sakarat, like the Burmese calendar, was largely based on the [[Hindu calendar]], an older version of ''[[Surya Siddhanta]]''. However, unlike Hindu calendar, it also uses a 19-year [[Metonic cycle]]. In order to reconcile the [[sidereal month]]s of Hindu calendar with Metonic cycle's [[tropical year|solar years]], the calendar inserts intercalary months and days on some schedule.&lt;ref name=yo-2001-398-399&gt;Ohashi 2001: 398–399&lt;/ref&gt;

====Intercalation====
The Siamese system uses three similar but not identical types of lunar years used by the Burmese system.&lt;ref name=jce-1989-9-10/&gt; Each calendar has the same regular year of 354 days and a leap year of 384 days. However, whereas the Burmese calendar adds the intercalary day only in a leap cycle according to its Metonic cycle, the Siamese calendar adds the intercalary day to a regular year. The Siamese calendar does add the extra day in the same place (Jyestha/Nayon), however.&lt;ref name=jce-1989-20&gt;Eade 1989: 20&lt;/ref&gt;

====Length of the year====
Down to the mid-19th century, the Burmese calendar and its Siamese cousin both used the ''Surya'' method. But between 1840 and 1853, [[Konbaung Dynasty]] switched to what it believed was a more accurate method called ''Thandeikta'' (a hybrid of the old ''Surya'' and an updated version of ''Surya'' from India). Thandeikta introduced a slightly longer solar year (0.56 second a year longer than the old system) and a slightly longer lunar month that produces a smaller gap between the two. However, it has turned out that the new system is actually slightly ''less'' accurate (0.56 second a year) than the old system in terms of the drift from the scientifically measured [[tropical year]]. At any rate, the old and the new systems are 23 minutes 50.8704 seconds and 23 minutes 51.4304 seconds respectively ahead of the actual tropical year. The error continues to mount.&lt;ref name=ambi-26-27&gt;Irwin 1909: 26–27&lt;/ref&gt;

====Metonic cycle====
Since the Thandeikta system not only does not solve but actually increases the accumulating drift issue, Burmese calendarists have resorted to periodically modifying the intercalation schedule of the Metonic cycle, starting in 1839 CE, using apparent reckoning. The fixed Metonic cycle remained in place in Siam.

[[File:51 to 55 North Castle Street, Edinburgh.jpg|thumb|The Innes office at 51 North Castle Street, Edinburgh (right door)]]
'''Cosmo Nelson Innes''' [[Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh|FRSE]] (9 September 1798 – 31 July 1874) was a Scottish [[advocate]], judge, historian and antiquary. He served as [[Advocate-Depute]], [[Sheriff (Scotland)|Sheriff]] of [[Elginshire]], and [[Principal Clerk of Session]].

He was a skilled decipherer of ancient Scottish records and helped to compile, edit and index ''Acts of the Scottish Parliament 1124–1707''. He was said to be tall, handsome but shy. He was accused of being a Catholic sympathiser whilst it remained illegal, and joined the newly created Scottish Episcopal Church, close in practice to the Catholic Church. [[Edward Ramsay|Dean Ramsay]], head of the Episcopal Church, was one of his friends.

==Life==

[[File:The grave of Cosmo Innes, Warriston Cemetery, Edinburgh.jpg|thumb|280px|The grave of Cosmo Innes, Warriston Cemetery, Edinburgh]]
Born in [[Durris Castle]] to Euphemia Russell and John Innes of [[Leuchars]] [[Writer to the Signet|WS]]. His middle name, Nelson, is almost certainly to mark [[Horatio Nelson]]'s then recent victory at the [[Battle of the Nile]] in August 1798. Thirteen of his 14 siblings died, only he and his sister Elizabeth survived.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.wauchopecottage.co.uk/susan/Mackay/Mackay%20Direct%20Ancestors/cosmoinnes.html|title=Susan's Family History Site|website=www.wauchopecottage.co.uk|access-date=2018-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; His friends included [[Alexander Forbes Irvine]] (1818–1892), whose career closely paralleled his own.&lt;ref name="cambridge"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/S0370164600052184|website=cambridge.org|title=Obituary – Alexander Forbes Irvine of Drum. By Sheriff Æneas Mackay. (Read January 30, 1893.)|accessdate=2018-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was educated at [[Edinburgh High School]], then at the [[University of Edinburgh]] under Professor [[James Pillans]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;http://www.andywightman.com/docs/Cosmo_Innes_Oxford_biog.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; He then undertook further studies at the universities of [[University of Aberdeen|Aberdeen]] and [[University of Glasgow|Glasgow]], and at [[Balliol College, Oxford]] (1817–1820)&lt;ref&gt;{{acad|id=INS850CN|name=Innes, Cosmo Nelson}}&lt;/ref&gt; graduating with a BA 1820. He was admitted to the [[Faculty of Advocates]] in 1822, and was appointed Professor of Constitutional Law and History at the [[University of Edinburgh]] in 1846.

In the 1830s he lived in [[Allan Ramsay (poet)|Allan Ramsay's]] former house, Ramsay Lodge, at the top of the [[Royal Mile]] (later absorbed into [[Ramsay Gardens]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://digital.nls.uk/83400711|title=Edinburgh Post Office annual directory, 1832-1833|last=|first=|date=|website=National Library of Scotland|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had offices with his brother, Thomas Innes, at 51 North Castle Street in the [[New Town, Edinburgh|New Town]].&lt;ref&gt;Edinburgh and Leith Post Office Directory 1840–41&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1840 to 1852 he was [[Sheriff of Moray]] during which time he had to deal with protesters angry at the export of potatoes from their district to mitigate the effects of the Irish potato famine. He resigned this role in 1852 to succeed [[Thomas Thomson (advocate)|Thomas Thomson]] in the role of [[Principal Clerk of Session]] in the Scottish [[Court of Session]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In 1843 he became a member of the [[Edinburgh Calotype Club]] one of the world's first photographic societies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://digital.nls.uk/pencilsoflight/history.htm|title=Pencils of Light|last=|first=|date=|website=National Library of Scotland|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also a member of the [[Spalding Club]], [[Maitland Club]] and [[Bannatyne Club]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In 1858 he was elected a Fellow of the [[Royal Society of Scotland]]. His proposer was [[James Thomson Gibson Craig]]. He served as the Society's Vice-President 1862–69.

In later life Innes lived in Inverleith House in northern Edinburgh. The house still exists and is in the grounds of Edinburgh's [[Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh|Royal Botanic Garden]]. The Garden was formed from Innes' former garden grounds.&lt;ref&gt;Edinburgh and Leith Post Office Directory 1870–1871&lt;/ref&gt;

He died unexpectedly on 31 July 1874 at Killin while on a "Highland Tour" in [[Killin]]. He was buried on 5 August at [[Warriston Cemetery]] in [[Edinburgh]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Biographical Index of Former Fellows of the Royal Society of Edinburgh 1783 – 2002|date=July 2006|publisher=The Royal Society of Edinburgh|isbn=0 902 198 84 X|url=https://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/biographical_index/fells_indexp1.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The grave lies on the east side of the main west path, just beyond the large Celtic cross to [[Horatio McCulloch]]. Given that Innes was one of the richest persons in Edinburgh, the gravestone is exceptionally modest.

==Works==

He was the author of ''Memoir of [[Thomas Thomson (advocate)|Thomas Thomson, Advocate]]'' (1854), ''Scotland in the Middle Ages'' (1860), ''Sketches of Early Scottish History'' (1861), ''Lectures on Scotch Legal Antiquities'' (1872) and ''Reminiscences of Scottish Life and Character'' (1875, co-written with [[Edward Ramsay|Dean Ramsay]])). He also edited many historical manuscripts for the [[Bannatyne Club]] and other antiquarian clubs. He also frequently wrote for the ''Quarterly Review'' and ''North British Review''.

Photographic works include "A Tour: The Coast of Spain" (an album of 1857); [[Midcalder]] Church (1856); [[Dunrobin Castle]] (1856); and [[Elgin Cathedral]] (1856).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.edinphoto.org.uk/3/3_pss_members_innes_cosmo.htm|title=PSS Members - Cosmo Innes|website=www.edinphoto.org.uk|access-date=2018-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family==
In 1826 Innes married Isabella Rose, daughter of [[Hugh Rose (1781–1827)|Hugh Rose]] of [[Kilravock]]. They had nine children: four girls and five boys.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

His daughter Katherine Innes married historian [[John Hill Burton]] in 1855, and another daughter Mary married [[Robert Finlay, 1st Viscount Finlay]], [[Lord Chancellor]] of Great Britain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thepeerage.com/p23413.htm#i234126|title=Mary Innes|work=The Peerage, A genealogical survey of the peerage of Britain as well as the royal families of Europe|accessdate=2013-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;W.

K. Burton]], the artist [[Mary Rose Hill Burton]] and the chemist Professor [[Cosmo Innes Burton]] FCS  [[FRSE]].

From 1836 he and his wife were appointed the formal guardian of Miss Isabella Grant, daughter of Patrick Grant who had died in India. In 1844 her uncle Captain Alexander Grant challenged the guardianship, however the court found the challenge inappropriate as her home was wholly appropriate and was the will of her father.&lt;ref&gt;Cases Decided in the Court of Session 1844, December 14, case 34&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Dragotin Lončar.jpg|thumb|Dragotin Lončar]]

'''Dragotin Lončar''' (November 5, 1876 – July 29, 1954) was a [[Slovenia]]n [[historian]], [[editing|editor]], and [[Social Democratic]] [[politician]].

He was born as '''Karel Lončar''' in Selo near [[Lukovica]] in [[Upper Carniola]]. After graduating from the [[Gymnasium (school)|State Gymnasium]] in [[Ljubljana]], he studied history at the [[Charles University]] in [[Prague]], graduating in 1904. In Prague, he joined the circle of young [[Slovenes|Slovene]] left-wing intellectuals that became influenced by the political and social thought of [[Tomáš Garrigue Masaryk]], which included figures such as [[Anton Dermota (politician)|Anton Dermota]] and [[Josip Ferfolja]].

After returning to the [[Slovene Lands]], he taught history at Ljubljana's [[Bežigrad Grammar School|First Gymnasium]], briefly serving as its director. He later served as the director of the [[National Museum of Slovenia]], and, from 1920, as head of the [[Slovene Society]] publishing house (''Slovenska matica'').

Before World War One, he joined the [[Yugoslav Social Democratic Party]], where he belonged to its right wing led by [[Albin Prepeluh]]. He left the party after it merged with the so-called [[Centrumaši|Centrists]] in 1921, who supported Yugoslav centralism. In 1924, Lončar was among the co-founders of the [[Slovenian Labour Agrarian Republican Party]], which in 1927 merged with the [[Independent Agrarian Party]] into the [[Slovenian Peasant Party]], a Slovenian counterpart to the [[Croatian Peasant Party]], with which it maintained strong ties.

After the establishment of the royal dictatorship of King [[Alexander I of Yugoslavia]], Lončar withdrew from politics, dedicating himself to his scholarly and editorial work.

He died in Ljubljana and was buried in the [[Žale]] cemetery.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7412">The '''Duff Cooper Prize''' is a literary prize awarded annually for the best work of [[history]], [[biography]], [[political science]] or (very occasionally) [[poetry]], published in [[English language|English]] or [[French language|French]]. The prize was established in honour of [[Duff Cooper]], a [[United Kingdom|British]] diplomat, Cabinet member and author. The prize was first awarded in 1956 to [[Alan Moorehead]] for his ''Gallipoli''. At present, the winner receives a first edition copy of Duff Cooper's autobiography ''[[Old Men Forget]]'' and a cheque for [[Pound sterling|£]]5,000.

==An overview==
After Duff Cooper's death in 1954, a group of his friends decided to establish a trust to endow a literary prize in his memory. The trust appoints five judges. Two of them are ''ex officio'': the [[List of Wardens of New College, Oxford|Warden]] of [[New College, Oxford]], and a member of Duff Cooper's family (initially, Duff Cooper's son, [[John Julius Norwich]] for the first thirty-six years, and then John Julius' daughter, [[Artemis Cooper]]). The other three judges appointed by the trust serve for five years and they appoint their own successors. The first three judges were [[Maurice Bowra]], [[Cyril Connolly]] and [[Raymond Mortimer]]. At present, the three appointed judges are writer and biographer [[Patrick Marnham]], film critic John McBratney, and former ''[[The Times Literary Supplement|TLS]]'' editor Lindsay Duguid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theduffcooperprize.org/duff-cooper-prize-history|title=History|publisher=The Duff Cooper Prize official website|accessdate=2015-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

From 2013, the prize has been known as The Pol Roger Duff Cooper Prize, following a sponsorship by [[Pol Roger]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=London Evening Standard|title=Champagne days for winners of the Duff Cooper Prize|date=February 21, 2013|accessdate=August 26, 2013|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/news/londoners-diary/champagne-days-for-winners-of-the-duff-cooper-prize-8504983.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{legend|#1E90FF|[[West Indies]]}}
{{legend|#ADD8E6|'''Countries sometimes included in West Indies'''}}]]The '''East Indies''' or the '''Indies''' are the lands of [[South Asia|South]] and [[Southeast Asia]].&lt;ref name="Oxford"&gt;Oxford Dictionary of English 2e, Oxford University Press, 2003, East Indies/East India&lt;/ref&gt; In a more restricted sense, the Indies can be used to refer to the islands of Southeast Asia, especially the [[Indonesian Archipelago]] and the [[Philippine Archipelago]].&lt;ref name="Oxford" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/176713/East-Indies|title=East Indies|work=Encyclopædia Britannica}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name "Indies" is derived from the [[Indus River|River Indus]] and is used to connote parts of Asia that came under [[Greater India|Indian cultural influence]].

Dutch-occupied colonies in the area were known for about 300 years as the [[Dutch East Indies]] before [[Indonesian independence]], while Spanish-occupied colonies were known as the [[Spanish East Indies]] before the American conquest and later [[Philippine independence]]. The East Indies may also include the former French-occupied [[Indochina]], former British territories [[Brunei]] and [[Singapore]] and former Portuguese [[East Timor]]. It does not, however, include the former Dutch New Guinea [[western New Guinea]] (West Papua), which is geographically considered to be part of [[Melanesia]].

The inhabitants of the East Indies are almost never called East Indians, distinguishing them both from inhabitants of the [[Caribbean]] (which is also called the [[West Indies]]) and from the [[indigenous peoples of the Americas]] who are often called "American Indians." In colonial times they were just "natives". However, the peoples of the East Indies comprise a wide variety of cultural diversity, and the inhabitants do not consider themselves as belonging to a single [[ethnic]] group. [[Buddhism]], [[Islam]], [[Christianity]] and [[Hinduism]] are the most popular [[major world religions|religions]] throughout the region, while [[Sikhism]], [[Jainism]], [[Chinese folk religion]] and various other traditional beliefs and practices are also prominent in some areas. The major languages in this area draw from a wide variety of [[language families]], and should not be confused with the term [[Indo-Aryan languages|Indic]], which refers only to a group of [[Indo-Iranian languages]] from [[South Asia]].

The extensive East Indies are subdivided into two sections (from a European perspective), archaically called Hither India and [[Farther India|Further India]]. The first is the former [[British India]], the second is [[Southeast Asia]].

Regions of the East Indies are sometimes known by the colonial empire they once belonged to, hence, ''British East Indies'' refers to [[Malaysia]], ''Dutch East Indies'' means [[Indonesia]], and ''Spanish East Indies'' means the [[Philippines]].

Historically, the king of [[Ethiopian Empire|Abyssinia]] (modern [[Ethiopia]]) was identified with "[[Prester John]] of the Indies", since that part of the world was imagined to be one of "Three Indias".

==History==
[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Rivier Kali Besar in de benedenstad van Djakarta West Java TMnr 10014936.jpg|left|thumb|[[Batavia, Dutch East Indies|Batavia]], [[Dutch East Indies]].]]

Exploration of these regions by [[Europe]]an powers first began in the late 15th century and early 16th century led by the [[Kingdom of Portugal|Portuguese]] [[Exploration|explorers]].&lt;ref name="WDL"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.wdl.org/en/item/4397/ |title = The Present State of the West-Indies: Containing an Accurate Description of What Parts Are Possessed by the Several Powers in Europe |website = [[World Digital Library]] |date = 1778 |accessdate = 2013-08-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Portuguese described the entire region they discovered as the ''Indies''. Eventually, the region would be broken up into a series of ''Indies'': The East Indies, which was also called "Old Indies" or "Great Indies", consisting of [[India]], and the West Indies, also called "New Indies" or "Little Indies", consisting of the [[Americas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kitchin|first=Thomas|title=The Present State of the West-Indies: Containing an Accurate Description of What Parts Are Possessed by the Several Powers in Europe|year=1778|publisher=R. Baldwin|location=London|page=3|pages=|url=http://www.wdl.org/en/item/4397/view/1/12/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These regions were important sources of trading goods, particularly [[cotton]], [[Indigo dye|indigo]] and [[spice]]s after the establishment of European trading companies: the [[British East India Company]] and [[Dutch East India Company]], among others, in the 17th century.

[[File:Old Binondo Church.jpg|thumb|Spanish East Indies (Las Islas Filipinas)]]

The [[New World]] was initially thought to be the easternmost part of the ''Indies'' by explorer [[Christopher Columbus]], who had grossly underestimated the westerly distance from Europe to Asia. Later, to avoid confusion, the New World came to be called the "West Indies", while the original Indies came to be called the "East Indies".

The designation ''East Indian'' was once primarily used to describe people of all of the East Indies, in order to avoid the potential confusion from the term [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|American Indian]] who were once simply referred to as ''Indians'' (see the [[Native American name controversy]] for more information).

[[File:Calendarium Parisiense enh.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|Month of January from ''Calendarium Parisiense'' (fourth quarter of the 14th c.). The golden numbers, in the leftmost column, indicate the year in the 19-year cycle on which a new moon occurs on a given date]]

A '''golden number''' (sometimes capitalized) is a number assigned to each [[year]] in sequence to indicate the year's position in a 19-year [[Metonic cycle]]. They are used in [[computus]] (the calculation of the date of [[Easter]]) and also in [[Runic calendar]]s. The golden number of any [[Julian calendar|Julian]] or [[Gregorian calendar|Gregorian]] calendar year can be calculated by dividing the year by 19, taking the remainder, and adding 1. (In mathematics this can be expressed as (''year number'' [[modulo operation|modulo]] 19) + 1.)

For example, {{CURRENTYEAR}} divided by 19 gives {{#expr: floor ({{CURRENTYEAR}}/19)}}, remainder {{#expr: {{CURRENTYEAR}} mod 19}}. Adding 1 to the remainder gives a golden number of {{#expr: 1+({{CURRENTYEAR}} mod 19)}}.

The golden number, as it was later called, first appears in a calendar composed by [[Abbo of Fleury]] around the year 1000. Around 1162 a certain Master William referred to this number as the golden number "because it is more precious than the other numbers."&lt;ref&gt;{{ Citation | author-last = Nothaft | author-first = C.

The earliest mention of Gregory is in 1720 when he is noted to have met a [[Serbia]]n illuminist in [[Berat]]; Gregory is said to have been a student of the [[Aromanian people|Aromanian]] philosopher [[Ioannis Chalkeus]], a significant figure in the [[Greek Enlightenment]].&lt;ref name="Elsie1"/&gt; As a budding scholar, Gregory arrived in [[Voskopoja]] some time at or before 1730, after which point he became confused with Gregory the Printer, as both were called "Gregory of Voskopoja" at times.&lt;ref name="Elsie1"/&gt; He published his first work, "Life of Saint Nikodemos" in 1741, and in 1744, he was chosen as the rector of the New Academy and edited two books there.&lt;ref name="Elsie1"/&gt; In 1746 he is thought to have taken up residence at [[Saint Gjon Vladimir's Church]] near [[Elbasan]].&lt;ref name="Elsie1"/&gt;  There, in 1761, he was the author of the famous [[Elbasan Gospel Manuscript]].&lt;ref name="Elsie1"/&gt; In 1768, he became Archbishop of the newly created Archbishopric of Durres and in 1772, he died.&lt;ref name="Elsie1"/&gt;

IIC co-operates closely with other organisations in the field, notably the [[International Centre for the Study of the Preservation and Restoration of Cultural Property]] and the Committee for Conservation of the [[International Council of Museums]] (ICOM) as well as national and regional conservation groups.

IIC is a learned society and is also registered with the [[Charity Commission for England and Wales]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.charity-commission.gov.uk/ShowCharity/RegisterOfCharities/CharityWithoutPartB.aspx?RegisteredCharityNumber=209677&amp;SubsidiaryNumber=0 |title=Charity overview |publisher=Charity-commission.gov.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
In 1930, the International Museums Office of the [[League of Nations]] held a conference in Rome on the examination and conservation of works of art. Following this meeting, the Museums Office issued a series of publications on the subject. In 1932 a technical journal of conservation studies, ''Technical Studies in the Field of the Fine Arts'',&lt;ref&gt;Packard, Elisabeth C.G. George Stout and the Art Technical Sections of the AAM annual meetings in the 1930s and 1940s. Part II.&lt;/ref&gt; was established by the [[Fogg Museum]] ([[Harvard University]]), under the managing editorship of [[George L. Stout]]. It continued publication until 1942.

The repatriation of art treasures after World War II brought together experts from Europe and the United States. They proposed the revival of ''Technical Studies'' and the formation of an international body of conservators to continue the interchange of information on the care and conservation of works of art. Between 1946 and 1948 a series of meetings was held to discuss these proposals. Foremost among those involved in the meetings were [[George L. Stout]], W.G. Constable (Boston), Ian Rawlins (London), and Paul Coremans (Brussels).

In December 1948 at a meeting of the [[International Council of Museums|ICOM]] Commission on the Care of Paintings in London, it was announced that a new international institute for conservation was about to be incorporated with offices in London and that its interests would be the scientific and technical study of the subject.&lt;ref name=MN&gt;Gettens, Rutherford J. IIC: an international association of conservators. ''Museum News'' (American Association of Museums) 47, no. 10 (1969 Jun), pp. 11-14.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early history ==
On April 27, 1950, the International Institute for the Conservation of Museum Objects (which acquired its present name in 1959) was incorporated as a limited company in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;The international journal of museum management and curatorship 1, no. 2 (1982 Jun), pp. 159-161.&lt;/ref&gt; Its aims were "to improve the state of knowledge and standards of practice and to provide a common meeting ground and publishing body for all who are interested in and professionally skilled in the conservation of museum objects”.&lt;ref name=MN /&gt; The Institute was to be concerned with:
* The status of conservators, by forming a professional self-electing body
* Publications: abstracts of the technical literature, and original work with a scientific bias - the end of the "secrets of the Old Masters"
* Training, with the aim of raising standards.

The office was established with the help of a grant from the [[Nuffield Foundation]]. London was chosen as the "midpoint" between the United States and continental Europe. Office space was provided free by the Trustees of the [[National Gallery (London)]]. The Institute moved to its own independent offices in 1968.

The membership was to consist of Fellows who were to be persons highly qualified in (or in positions of great authority in) conservation and Associates who were to be "persons anxious to promote the objects of the Institute". Later a category of Institutional Members was introduced.

When the IIC was founded in 1950, the Founder Fellows were [[George L. Stout]], Rutherford J. Gettens, Richard Buck, W.G. Constable, Murray Pease, Ian Rawlins, [[Harold Plenderleith]], Sir [[Wallace Akers]] (chairman of ICI), Helmut Ruhemann, and [[Paul B. Coremans|Paul Coremans]]. Others who joined in that first year included Arthur van Schendel, [[René Sneyers]], and Sheldon and Caroline Keck. Stout became the IIC's first President, with Plenderleith its Treasurer and Rawlins its Secretary-General.&lt;ref name=MN /&gt;

The IIC membership grew quickly. In October 1952 there were 62 members (38 of them Fellows) with 64 candidates for associate membership in process of election; by March 1952, there were 167 members (50 of them Fellows).&lt;ref&gt;Brooks, Hero Boothroyd. ''A Short History of IIC: Foundation and Development''. IIC (2000), {{ISBN|0-9500525-3-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Membership ==
* IIC Fellows are senior members of the profession who are elected by the existing body of Fellows. Fellowship of IIC is open to all members who are actively engaged in the profession of conservation. Fellows must be able to demonstrate commitment to the profession and to show that they keep up-to-date with relevant developments. Indicators include publications, voluntary service to conservation organisations, participation in conferences and training events, membership of other relevant professional bodies, and accreditation by a national organisation.&lt;ref&gt;Anon.

* IIC Individual membership is open to those working in conservation and with an interest in conserving the world's heritage.
* Student membership of IIC is for those enrolled in a full-time programme of education, training or work experience under the supervision of a professional conservator.
* Institutional IIC membership is intended for museum and galleries, libraries and archives, conservation schools, research institutes and commercial firms.

== Publications  &amp; Communications ==
In May 1952, the first issue of the ''IIC Newsletter'' appeared; this later became the ''IIC Bulletin'' and in turn was succeeded in 2007 by ''News in Conservation''. In October 1952, ''Studies in Conservation'' began publication. ''IIC Abstracts'', an international journal of abstracts of the technical literature and the forerunner of ''Art and Archaeology Technical Abstracts'', was first published in 1955. With changing editorship, it ran for five volumes ending with Vol.5, no.4 (Autumn 1965). In 2000, the first volume of the annual ''Reviews in Conservation'' was published.

With the next event planned for 2019.

== Regional groups ==
IIC's Regional Groups began in 1958. Regional Groups are independent associations affiliated or associated with IIC. A Regional Group is required to adhere to the aims and objectives of the IIC as expressed in the Memorandum of Association. Its by-laws must be approved by the IIC Council and its officers should be members of IIC. The first Regional Groups formed were the IIC-United Kingdom Group (now Icon, the [[Institute of Conservation]]) and the IIC-American Group (now the [[American Institute for Conservation]]). There are currently Regional Groups in Scandinavia, Austria, Croatia, France, Greece, Italy, Japan, and Spain as well as an Arabic Group.

=== Forbes Prize Lecture ===
The Forbes Prize Lecture has been delivered at every IIC Congress since the Rome Congress in 1961.  In 1958 a Forbes Prize Fund had been set up at the [[Fogg Art Museum]], [[Harvard University]], to which financial contributions were made in recognition of [[Edward W. Forbes]]'s services to conservation. The fund was to be administered by IIC to provide some kind of prize for outstanding work in the field of conservation. It was agreed in 1960 that the accumulated funds should be awarded in the form of a fee for a Forbes Lecture at the 1961 IIC Rome Conference, and the first Forbes Prize lecture was given there by [[Harold Plenderleith]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13323">[[File:Is God Dead.jpg|thumb|April 8, 1966, cover of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine]]
"'''Is God Dead?'''" was an April 8, 1966, cover story for the news magazine ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://content.time.com/time/covers/0,16641,19660408,00.html |title=TIME Magazine Cover: Is God Dead? |work=Time |date=1966-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; A previous article, from October 1965, had investigated a trend among 1960s theologians to write [[God]] out of the field of [[theology]]. The 1966 article looked in greater depth at the problems facing modern theologians, in making God relevant to an increasingly secular society. Modern science had eliminated the need for religion to explain the natural world, and God took up less and less space in people's daily lives. The ideas of various scholars were brought in, including the application of contemporary philosophy to the field of theology, and a more personal, individual approach to religion.

The issue drew heavy criticism, both from the broader public and from clergymen. Much of the criticism was directed at the provocative magazine cover, rather than the content of the article. The cover{{spaced ndash}}all black with the words "Is God Dead?" in large red text{{spaced ndash}}marked the first time in the magazine's history that text with no accompanying image was used. In 2008, the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' named the "Is God Dead?" issue among "10 magazine covers that shook the world".

==Background==
In 1966, [[Otto Fuerbringer]] had been editor of the news magazine ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' for six years.&lt;ref name="Schudel"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/08/01/AR2008080100146.html|title=Otto Fuerbringer; Time Editor in 1960s Helped Start Money, People Magazines|last=Schudel|first=Matt|date=2008-08-01|work=[[The Washington Post]]|accessdate=2009-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; He helped to increase the circulation of the magazine, partly by changing its rather austere image. Though a conservative himself, he made the magazine focus extensively on the counter-culture and the political and intellectual radicalism of the 1960s.&lt;ref name="Hevesi"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/30/us/30fuerbringer.html?n=Top/Reference/Times%20Topics/Organizations/T/Time%20Inc.|title=Otto Fuerbringer, Former Time Editor, Dies at 97|last=Hevesi|first=Dennis|date=2008-07-30|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=2009-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; A best-selling 1964 issue, for instance, had dealt with the [[sexual revolution]].&lt;ref name="Hevesi"/&gt; Already in October 1965 the magazine had published an article on the new radical theological movement.&lt;ref name="Gray"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.georgiaencyclopedia.org/nge/Article.jsp?id=h-861|title="God Is Dead" Controversy|last=Gray|first=Patrick|date=2003-04-01|work=Georgia Encyclopedia|accessdate=2009-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The April 8, 1966, cover of ''Time'' magazine was the first cover in the magazine's history to feature only type, and no photo.&lt;ref name="10 covers"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/la-et-10magazinecovers14-july14-pg,0,5472017.photogallery?index=7|title=10 magazine covers that shook the world|date=July 2008|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|accessdate=2009-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cover{{spaced ndash}}with the traditional, red border{{spaced ndash}}was all black, with the words "Is God Dead?" in large, red text. The question was a reference to [[Friedrich Nietzsche]]'s much-quoted postulate "[[God is dead]]" ({{lang-de|Gott ist tot |italic=yes |links=no}}),&lt;ref name="Hidden God"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,835309,00.html|title=Toward a Hidden God|last=|first=|date=1966-04-08|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|accessdate=2009-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; which he first proposed in his 1882 book ''[[The Gay Science]]''.

==Themes presented by the article==

===The problems===
The article accompanying the magazine cover, titled "Toward a Hidden God" and written by religion editor [[John T. Elson]], mentioned  the so-called "God Is Dead" movement only briefly in its introduction. In a footnote it identified the leaders of the movement as "[[Thomas J. J. Altizer]] of [[Emory University]], [[William Hamilton (theologian)|William Hamilton]] of [[Colgate Rochester Crozer Divinity School|Colgate Rochester Divinity School]], and [[Paul van Buren]] of [[Temple University]]", and explained how these theologians had been trying to construct a theology without God. This theme had already been dealt with in greater detail in the shorter and less prominent article "The "God Is Dead" Movement", on October 22, 1965.&lt;ref name="God Is Dead"&gt;This article also mentioned [[Gabriel Vahanian]] of [[Syracuse University]], in addition to the three men named above; {{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,941410,00.html|title=The "God Is Dead" Movement|last=|first=|date=1965-10-22|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|accessdate=2009-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Quote|Nietzsche's thesis was that striving, self-centered man had killed God, and that settled that. The current death-of-God group believes that God is indeed absolutely dead, but proposes to carry on and write a theology without theos, without God.|''Toward a Hidden God''}}

The article pointed out that while this movement had roots in the philosophy of [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], it also drew on a broader range of thinkers. For example, philosophers and theologians like [[Søren Kierkegaard]] and [[Dietrich Bonhoeffer]] expressed concerns about the role of God in an increasingly secularised world. The immediate reality did not indicate a death of God or religion; [[Pope John XXIII]]'s [[Second Vatican Council]] had done much to revitalize the [[Roman Catholic Church]], while in the United States, as many as 97% declared a belief in God. Evangelical ministers such as [[Billy Graham]] and Christian artists like the playwright [[William Alfred]] could be brought as witness to the continued vitality of the Christian church. Nevertheless, this religiosity was mostly skin-deep; only 27% of Americans called themselves deeply religious.

The article then went on to explain the history of [[monotheism]], culminating in the omnipresent Catholic church of the European [[Middle Ages]]. This zenith, however, was, according to the article, the beginning of the demise of Christianity: as society became increasingly secularised, the religious sphere of society became marginalised. Scientific discovery, from the [[Copernican Revolution]] to [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]]'s theory of [[evolution]], eliminated much of the need for religious explanations to life. [[Isaac Newton|Newton]] and [[René Descartes|Descartes]] were perhaps personally devout men, but their discoveries "explained much of nature that previously seemed godly mysteries."

===Possible solutions===
Having laid out the philosophical and historical background, the article then asserted that there was still much curiosity among the general population about God and His relation to the world, and that for the modern theologian who wished to address this curiosity, there seemed to be four options:
{{quote|stop talking about God for awhile, stick to what the Bible says, formulate a new image and concept of God using contemporary thought categories, or simply point the way to areas of human experience that indicate the presence of something beyond man in life.}}

According to the article, some contemporary ministers and theologians chose to focus on the life and teachings of [[Jesus]], rather than on God, since Christ was a figure with great appeal among the broader population, but this solution ran dangerously close to ethical [[humanism]]. [[Biblical literalism]], on the other hand, might have had an appeal to the fervent believer, but did not speak to most people in a world where the language of the [[Bible]] was increasingly unfamiliar.

The article described other attempts that had been made to solve to the problems of religion, including the adaptation of contemporary philosophical terminology to explain God, and cited efforts made to adapt the writings of [[Martin Heidegger]] and [[Alfred North Whitehead]] to modern theology. At the same time it noted that [[Ian Ramsey]] of [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] had spoken of so-called "discernment situations"; situations in life that led man to question his own existence and purpose, and turn towards a greater power. The article concluded that the current crisis of faith could be healthy for the church, and that it might force clergymen and theologians to abandon previously held certainties: "The church might well need to take a position of reverent agnosticism regarding some doctrines that it had previously proclaimed with excessive conviction."&lt;ref name="Hidden God"/&gt;

The publication of the article immediately led to a public backlash. Editorial pages of newspapers received numerous letters from angry readers, and clergymen vehemently protested the content of the article.&lt;ref name="Gray"/&gt; Even though the article itself explored the theological and philosophical issues in depth, "[m]any people...were too quick to judge the magazine by its cover and denounced ''Time'' as a haven of godlessness".&lt;ref name="Schudel2"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://voices.washingtonpost.com/postmortem/2008/07/is_god_dead.html|title=Is God Dead?

J. Altizer in particular.&lt;ref name="Gray"/&gt; Altizer left Emory in 1968, and by the end of the decade the "death of God" movement had lost much of its momentum.&lt;ref name="Gray"/&gt; In its issue of December 26, 1969, ''Time'' ran a follow-up cover story asking, "Is God Coming Back to Life"?&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.time.com/time/covers/0,16641,19691226,00.html |title=TIME Magazine Cover: Is God Coming Back to Life?|work=Time|date=1969-12-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The magazine cover also entered the realm of popular culture: in a scene from the 1968 horror movie ''[[Rosemary's Baby (film)|Rosemary's Baby]]'', the protagonist Rosemary Woodhouse picks up the issue in a doctor's waiting room.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rothman|first=William|author2=Stanley Cavell |author3=Marian Keane |title=Reading Cavell's The World Viewed|work=Wayne State University Press|year=2000|pages=157|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=j5W4H--kicoC|accessdate=2009-05-12 | isbn=978-0-8143-2896-5 | publisher=Wayne State University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "Is God Dead?" issue was to have an enduring place in American journalism. In 2008, the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' listed the issue in a featured titled "10 magazine covers that shook the world".&lt;ref name="10 covers"/&gt; In April 2009, ''[[Newsweek]]'' magazine ran a special report on the decline of religion in the United States under the title "The End of Christian America".

'''Sir John George Bourinot''', {{post-nominals|country=CAN|KCMG|FRSC}} (October 24, 1836 &amp;ndash; October 13, 1902) was a [[Canadians|Canadian]] journalist, historian, and civil servant, sole author of the first Canadian effort in 1884 to document ''Parliamentary Procedure and Practice'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://books1.scholarsportal.info/viewdoc.html?id=/ebooks/oca2/40/parliamentarypro00bouruoft Scholars Portal Books: "Parliamentary procedure and practice; with an introductory account of the origin and growth of parliamentary institutions in the Dominion of Canada." By Bourinot, John George"]&lt;/ref&gt; and remembered as an expert in parliamentary procedure and constitutional law.

==Life==
Born in [[Sydney, Nova Scotia]], he was the oldest son of [[John George Bourinot (elder)|John Bourinot]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Canadian Railway Employees' Monthly|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8p5aAAAAYAAJ|volume=38|year=1952|publisher=Canadian Brotherhood of Railway Employees and Other Transport Workers.|page=54}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was educated at Sydney before enrolling at [[University of Trinity College|Trinity College]], [[Toronto]], in 1854. Although he was a good student, he left the university two years later and worked as a parliamentary reporter for a Toronto newspaper. In 1860, he was in [[City of Halifax|Halifax]], where he founded, together with [[Joseph C. Crosskill]], his own newspaper, the ''Evening Reporter''. In May 1867, Bourinot left this newspaper and worked as a freelance writer for some time, until he secured a job as a clerk at the [[Senate of Canada]] in May 1869. In the following years, he steadily advanced through various grades until he was appointed chief [[List of Clerks of the Canadian House of Commons|clerk]] of the [[House of Commons of Canada]] in December 1880. a post he would occupy until his death 22 years later.

A founding member of the [[Royal Society of Canada]], he also acted as its honorary secretary, and in 1892 served as president of the society. He wrote many books political history, some of which were considered references for decades to come. His ''Parliamentary Procedure and Practice in Canada'' (Montréal, 1884) is considered a standard work, and was cited as recently as 24 October 2013 by the [[Speaker of the Senate (Canada)|Speaker of the Senate]], the Honourable [[Noel Kinsella]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.parl.gc.ca/Content/Sen/Chamber/412/Debates/011db_2013-11-04-e.htm#24 Senate Hansard, "ORDERS OF THE DAY Speaker's Rulings Motion No. 2 and Motion to Refer to a Committee" 24 Oct 2013, 15h10]&lt;/ref&gt; ''How Canada is governed'' (Toronto, 1895) was a widely used textbook, and ''Canada under British rule, 1760 &amp;ndash; 1900'' (Cambridge, England, 1900) was also popular. He also wrote books about the history of Nova Scotia, and several more on constitutional law.  He also created the work that was posthumously to be called ''[[Bourinot's Rules of Order]]''.

Bourinot was an advocate of [[Imperial Federation]] and a proponent of both a national university and library of Canada. He also was in favour of the right of women to higher education.  In his later life, Bourinot received honorary degrees from many Canadian universities and was created CMG in 1890 and [[Order of St Michael and St George|KCMG]] in 1898. He died in [[Ottawa]], [[Ontario]] and was buried in [[Beechwood Cemetery]] there.

==Honors==
Bourinot was elected a member of the [[American Antiquarian Society]] in 1893.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.americanantiquarian.org/memberlistb American Antiquarian Society Members Directory]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{nihongo|'''Jōryaku'''|承暦}} was a [[Japanese era name]] (年号, ''nengō'', lit. year name) after ''[[Jōhō]]'' and before ''[[Eihō]].''  This period spanned the years from November 1077 through February 1081.&lt;ref&gt;Nussbaum, Louis-Frédéric. (2005). "''Jōryaku''" in {{Google books|p2QnPijAEmEC|''Japan Encyclopedia'', p. 433|page=433}}; n.b., Louis-Frédéric is pseudonym of Louis-Frédéric Nussbaum, ''see'' [https://archive.is/20120524174828/http://dispatch.opac.ddb.de/DB=4.1/PPN?PPN=128842709 Deutsche Nationalbibliothek Authority File].&lt;/ref&gt; The reigning emperor was {{nihongo|[[Emperor Shirakawa]]''-tennō''|白河天皇}}.&lt;ref&gt;Titsingh, Isaac. (1834). [https://books.google.com/books?id=18oNAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PP9&amp;dq=nipon+o+dai+itsi+ran#PRA1-PA169,M1  ''Annales des empereurs du Japon'', pp. 169-170;] Brown, Delmer ''et al.'' (1979). ''Gukanshō'', p. 316; Varley, H. Paul. (1980). ''Jinnō Shōtōki'', p. 200-202.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Change of Era==
* '''January 27, 1077''' {{nihongo|''Jōryaku gannen''|承暦元年}}&lt;!-- NengoCalc 承暦一年一月一日 --&gt;: The new era name was created to mark an event or series of events. The previous era ended and the new one commenced in ''Jōhō'' 4, on the 17th day of the 11th month of 1077.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, p. 316.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Events of the ''Jōryaku'' Era==
* '''1077''' (''Jōryaku 1, 1st month''): Shirakawa  went to the [[Kamo Shrines]]; and he visited [[Kiyomizu-dera]] and other Buddhist temples.&lt;ref name="t170"&gt;Titsingh, [https://books.google.com/books?id=18oNAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PP9&amp;dq=nipon+o+dai+itsi+ran#PRA1-PA170,M1  p. 170.]&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''1077''' (''Jōryaku 1, 2nd month''): ''Udaijin'' Minamoto no Morofusa died at of an ulcer at the age of 7o.&lt;ref name="t170"/&gt;
* '''1077''' (''Jōryaku 1''): The emperor caused [[Hosshō-ji]] (dedicated to the "Superiority of Buddhist Law") to be built at Shirakawa in fulfillment of a sacred vow. This temple became only the first of a series of "sacred  vow" temples to be created  by Imperial decree. Hosshō-ji's nine-storied pagoda would become the most elaborate Imperial-sponsored temple structure ever erected up to this time.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, p. 317; Varley, p. 200.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''1079''' (''Jōryaku 3, 10th month''): The emperor visited the [[Fushimi Inari-taisha]] at the foot of Mount Fushimi and the [[Yasaka Shrine]].&lt;ref name="t170"/&gt;

[[Image:Administrative division of denmark in medieval times.jpg|thumb|490px|[[Subnational|Administrative division]] of Denmark in medieval times showing [[Hundred (county subdivision)|''herreder'']] and ''[[syssel|sysler]]''. The entire country was divided into herreder, shown outlined in red. Coloured areas show Jutland's syssel divisions. Zealand's four ecclesiastic sysler are not included.&lt;!--the ones in Jutland also had temporal responsibilities--&gt;]]
The three '''lands of Denmark''' historically formed the [[Denmark|Danish kingdom]] from its unification and consolidation in the 10th century:

*[[Zealand]] (''Sjælland'') and the [[List of islands of Denmark|islands]] south of it, with [[Roskilde]] as a centre
*[[Jutland]] (''Jylland''), the western peninsula, and the island of [[Fyn]], with [[Viborg, Denmark|Viborg]] as a centre.
*[[Skåneland|Scania]] (''Skåneland'') on the [[Scandinavian peninsula]], with [[Lund]] as a centre

Each of the lands retained their own [[Thing (assembly)|thing]] (''ting'') and statute laws until late medieval time ([[Codex Holmiensis|Jutlandic Law]], [[Zealandic Law]] and [[Scanian Law]]). Although Denmark was a unified kingdom, the custom of rendering [[Homage (feudal)|homage]] to the King at the three individual assemblies remained. A remnant is the current division of Denmark into two [[Law of Denmark#High Courts|High Court districts]], the Eastern and Western High Court.

During the early 19th century, [[Zealand]] and [[Fyn]] became administratively united as ''Østifterne'' with a provincial assembly in Roskilde. ''Jutland'', ''The Islands'' and ''Bornholm'' remains an informal subdivision still used, notably in [[meteorology]] and public [[statistics]]. [[Bornholm]] is the only part to represent Scania after the rest of the region was lost to [[Sweden]] in 1658.  (Bornholm was also lost in 1658, but was recovered two years later.)

In recent decades, the less specific division between ''Eastern'' and ''Western'' Denmark has also become common, for example when describing [[logistics|logistic]], [[economy|economic]] and political patterns. Funen may be attributed to both the eastern and western part of the country, the border line being either the [[Great Belt]] or the [[Little Belt]].

For this '''list of lost films''', a [[lost film]] is defined as one of which no part of a print is known to have survived.  For films in which any portion of the footage remains (including [[Trailer (promotion)|trailers]]), see [[List of incomplete or partially lost films]].

==Reasons for loss== 
Films may go missing for a number of reasons. One major contributing factor is the common use of [[Nitrate film stock|nitrate film]] until the early 1950s. This type of film is highly flammable, and there have been several devastating fires, such as the [[Universal Pictures]] fire in 1924, the [[1937 Fox vault fire]] and the [[1965 MGM vault fire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fan.tcm.com/_Vault-and-Nitrate-Fires-A-History/blog/346284/66470.html |title=Vault and Nitrate Fires – A History |publisher=[[Turner Classic Movies|TCM.com]] |accessdate=2012-07-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090615124657/http://fan.tcm.com/_Vault-and-Nitrate-Fires-A-History/blog/346284/66470.html |archivedate=June 15, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Black-and-white film [[release print|prints]] judged to be otherwise worthless were sometimes incinerated to salvage the meager scrap value of the silver image particles in their [[photographic emulsion|emulsions]].&lt;ref name=BFI&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.screenonline.org.uk/film/id/1396223/index.html |title=Lost Then Found |author=Jo Botting |publisher=[[British Film Institute]] (screenonline.org.uk) |accessdate=February 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Films have disappeared when production companies went bankrupt.&lt;ref name=BFI/&gt; Occasionally, a studio would remake a film and destroy the earlier version.&lt;ref name=BFI/&gt; Silent films in particular were once seen as having no further commercial value and were simply junked to clear out expensive storage space.&lt;ref&gt;Robert A. Harris, [http://www.widescreenmuseum.com/rah.htm public hearing statement] to the National Film Preservation Board of the Library of Congress, Washington, D.C., February 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Statistics on lost films== 
This is necessarily an incomplete list. [[Martin Scorsese]]'s [[The Film Foundation|Film Foundation]] claims that "half of all American films made before 1950 and over 90% of films made before 1929 are lost forever."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.film-foundation.org/columbus-dispatch |title=Group's rescue of old films preserves glimpse into past |publisher=The Film Foundation/''[[The Columbus Dispatch]]'' |accessdate=August 31, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Deutsche Kinemathek]] estimates that 80–90% of silent films are gone;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.lost-films.eu/index/whylf |title=Why |publisher=Deutsche Kinemathek |accessdate=March 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; the film archive's own list contains over 3500 lost films.

A study by the [[Library of Congress]] states that 75% of all silent films are now lost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.thewire.com/culture/2013/12/most-americas-silent-films-are-lost-forever/355775/ | title=Most of America's Silent Films Are Lost Forever | publisher=[[The Wire]] | date=December 4, 2013 | accessdate=4 November 2014 | author=Ohlheiser, Abby}}&lt;/ref&gt; While others dispute whether the percentage is quite that high,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Nitrate Won't Wait: History of Film Preservation in the United States |last=Slide |first=Anthony |authorlink=Anthony Slide |year=2000 |publisher=McFarland |location= |isbn=0786408367 |page=5 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HZIq5-_hu5cC&amp;pg=PA5 |accessdate=March 25, 2013 |quote=It is often claimed that 75 percent of all American silent films are gone and 50 percent of all films made prior to 1950 are lost, but such figures, as archivists admit in private, were thought up on the spur of the moment, without statistical information to back them up.}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is impractical to enumerate any but the more notable and those that can be sourced.

For example, roughly 200 out of over 500 [[Georges Méliès filmography|Méliès' films]] and 350 out of over 1,000 [[Alice Guy-Blaché|Alice Guy's films]] remain in existence today.

[[File:Melpomene (by Joseph Fagnani).jpg|thumb|''Melpomene'' by [[Joseph Fagnani]] (1819–1873) (1869)]]

'''Melpomene''' ({{IPAc-en|m|ɛ|l|ˈ|p|ɒ|m|ᵻ|n|iː}}; {{lang-grc|[[wikt:Μελπομένη#Ancient Greek|Μελπομένη]]|Melpoménē|to sing' or 'the one that is melodious}}), initially the [[Muse]] of Chorus, she then became the '''Muse of Tragedy''', for which she is best known now.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Blyth |first=Charles |title=Virgilian Tragedy and [[Troilus]] |publisher= [[The Chaucer Review]] |date=1990 |volume=24 |number=3 |pages=211-218}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her name was derived from the Greek verb melpô or melpomai meaning "to celebrate with dance and song." She is often represented with a tragic mask and wearing the [[cothurnus]], boots traditionally worn by tragic actors. Often, she also holds a knife or club in one hand and the tragic mask in the other.

Melpomene is the daughter of [[Zeus]] and [[Mnemosyne]]. Her sisters include [[Calliope]] (muse of epic poetry), [[Clio]] (muse of history), [[Euterpe]] (muse of lyrical poetry), [[Terpsichore]] (muse of dancing), [[Erato]] (muse of erotic poetry), [[Thalia (muse)|Thalia]] (muse of comedy), [[Polyhymnia]] (muse of hymns), and [[Urania]] (muse of astronomy).  She is also the mother of several of the [[Siren (mythology)#List of Sirens|Sirens]], the divine handmaidens of [[Persephone|Kore (Persephone/Proserpina)]] who were cursed by her mother, [[Demeter]]/[[Ceres (mythology)|Ceres]], when they were unable to prevent the kidnapping of Kore (Persephone/[[Proserpina]]) by [[Hades]]/[[Pluto (mythology)|Pluto]].  

In Roman and Greek poetry, it was traditional{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}} to invoke the goddess Melpomene so that one might create beautiful lyrical phrases (see [[Horace's Odes]]).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4444">'''Merritt Roe Smith''' (1940) is an American [[historian]]. He is the Leverett and William Cutten Professor of the History of Technology at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]].&lt;ref&gt;http://history.mit.edu/people/merritt-roe-smith&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
Smith graduated from [[Georgetown University]], and [[Pennsylvania State University]] with a Ph.D. His research focuses on the [[history of technological innovation]] and [[social change]]. 
He is currently writing a monograph on technology and the [[American Civil War]]. 
Smith is a Fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]], and he is past president of the [[Society for the History of Technology]].

In the 1970s, Smith made a large contribution to our understanding of how interchangeability of mechanical parts went from concept to realization. He did this by rescuing the amazing work of gunmaker John Hall at the Harpers Ferry Armory from obscurity. During 1815-1834, Hall had pulled together all previous progress on industrial standardization and combined it with brilliant machine designs and effective team management to realize the long-desired goal of true parts interchangeability. Hall’s innovative breechloading US Rifle Model 1819 was the first product ever made in large numbers whose components could be freely exchanged with one another and still function. Earlier industrial historians had often credited Eli Whitney with perfecting standardized parts prior to Smith, but although Whitney did make some progress toward the goal, he ultimately gave up the effort. Smith’s research on Hall’s work at Harpers Ferry has put the Maine craftsman back in his proper position in the industrial pantheon. (David Hounshell, From the American System to Mass Production, 1800-1932, p.&amp;nbsp;29.) Hall’s manufacturing technique became known as the American System, and today it is universal. “Although recognized by his contemporaries as a major contributor to the American System,” wrote industrial historian David Hounshell in 1984, “John H. Hall escaped the attention of modern historians until recently. Merritt Roe Smith’s Harpers Ferry and the New Technology has provided an outstanding study of Hall’s achievements.” (Hounshell, American System, p.&amp;nbsp;39.)

The '''Museum of Archaeology and Ethnography''' is a museum in [[Baku]], [[Azerbaijan]], that was established in 1976. It bears the name of the Azerbaijani architect-[[Mikayil Huseynov]]. The museum has two parts. The [[ethnography]] section displays materials related to the 19th century and early 20th century, as well as the life of Azerbaijani people.&lt;ref name="national-tourism"&gt;{{cite| title=Museums, Reserves, Galleries of Baku: Museum of Archaeology and Ethnography | publisher=National Tourism Promotion Bureau | date=2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Medieval water well.JPG|thumb|left|Medieval well at the museum]]
The [[archaeology]] section exhibits findings covering all stages of Azerbaijani's historical development, its culture from the [[Stone Age]] to the late Middle Ages.&lt;ref name="national-tourism" /&gt;

The museum's exhibitions give detailed information about the sites of primitive people, living houses on the territory of Azerbaijan, settlements belonging to cattle breeders and farmers, historical and material culture of ancient states, gravestone monuments, Azerbaijani arts of ancient times, economy, lifestyle, moral values of ancestors of the Azerbaijani people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.icom.azeurotel.com/az/history02az.html | work=Azerbaijan National Committee of International Council of Museums | title=Arxeologiya və Etnoqrafiya Muzeyi | accessdate=8 June 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008 the museum underwent restoration works and increased the number of its exhibitions to 2000.&lt;ref name="national-tourism" /&gt;

== The building ==
It was built at the beginning of the 20th century and called "Chained House". In 1920, this property belonged to the merchant Haji Mammadhuseyn Mammadov. In 1928, Melikov's brothers, who were considered the renowned merchants of the Icherisheher, took this property. In 1930, the Baku Customs Office confiscated this property for smuggling and gave it to the state. Since 1930, a sewing factory named after N.Narimanov has been set up. As the establishment of sewing factory, changes have been made in the facade and some architectural elements have been taken. Malikov brothers were the last owner of the property, thus this building is known as the House of Melikov brothers. The facade of the building, facing Gosha Gala Gates divides the main street into the left and right to the Great Gala and Tower Streets. The architectural style and artistic aesthetic appearance of the chain building occupy a place within the architectural monuments built in the Icheri Sheher early in the twentieth century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://icherisheher.az/az/monument/13 Icherisheher monuments.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5082">[[Image:Frauenkirche-dresden.jpg|thumb|300px|The Dresden Neumarkt in spring 2008]]
[[Image:Neumarkt Karte.png|thumb|300px|The quarters of Dresden's Neumarkt area.]]
The '''Neumarkt in Dresden''' is a central and culturally significant section of the [[Dresden]] inner city. The historic area was almost completely wiped out during the [[Bombing of Dresden in World War II|Allied bomb attack]] during the [[Second World War]]. After the war Dresden fell under [[Soviet Occupation Zone|Soviet occupation]] and later the [[communist]] [[German Democratic Republic]] who rebuilt the Neumarkt area in [[socialist realist]] style and partially with historic buildings. However huge areas and parcels of the place remained untilled. After the [[Revolutions of 1989|fall of Communism]] and [[German reunification]] the decision was made to restore the Neumarkt to its pre-war look.

==History==
Due to its location on a slight rise above the flood-prone [[Elbe River]], the Neumarkt was one of the first areas of Dresden's old city to be settled, with a small village arising around the old Frauenkirche.  However, it was not actually located within the city walls until the city was expanded in 1530, from which point on, the old town contained two market squares.  The square located around the [[Kreuzkirche, Dresden|Kreuzkirche]] was renamed ''Altmarkt'' (German for "Old Market"), and the square surrounding the Frauenkirche was named the ''Neumarkt'' ("New Market").

During the reign of [[August II the Strong]], a great number of structures in Dresden were built in Baroque style, including the present-day Frauenkirche, and numerous other houses surrounding the Neumarkt.  After damage sustained to buildings through artillery fire in the [[Seven Years' War]], a number of structures on the Neumarkt were rebuilt in the [[Rococo]] and [[late Baroque]] styles.

During the 19th century and into the early 20th century, the Neumarkt remained largely unchanged, except for renovations to the Johanneum completed in 1873 and the construction of the Albertinum and Academy of Arts completed at the end of the 1800s.

===Bombing of Dresden and Communist era===
During the [[Bombing of Dresden in World War II|bomb attack]] on Dresden in February 1945, the area around the Neumarkt was almost entirely destroyed in the resulting firestorm.  The main structure of the Frauenkirche survived the initial bombing and firestorm, before collapsing a few days later.  During the 1950s and 60s under rule of the [[German Democratic Republic]], the Neumarkt and Altmarkt formed a mostly vacant area through the middle of the old city, save for the ruins of the Frauenkirche standing as a memorial to the horrors of war.  The two squares were separated by the widened Wilsdruffer Strasse, then from 1969 by the Palace of Culture, and then later by new apartment blocks.

==Reconstruction==
[[File:Dresden-Neumarkt-pano.jpg|thumb|500px|Panorama of reconstructed sections of the Dresdner Neumarkt in May 2008]]The completion of the reconstructed [[Dresden Frauenkirche]] in 2005 marked the first step in rebuilding the Neumarkt.  Organisations such as the Gesellschaft Historischer Neumarkt Dresden actively encourage an historically-faithful reconstruction of the structures around the Neumarkt, giving an outward appearance as close as possible to that from before 1945.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.neumarkt-dresden.de/english/index-engl.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-06-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722055514/http://www.neumarkt-dresden.de/english/index-engl.html |archivedate=2011-07-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The areas around the square have been divided into 8 "Quarters", with each being rebuilt as a separate project, the majority of buildings to be rebuilt either to the original structure or at least with a facade similar to the original.

Quarter I and the front section of Quarters II, III, IV and V(II) have since been completed, with Quarter VIII currently under construction.

===Controversy and Criticism Regarding the Reconstruction===
The reconstruction of the structures surrounding the Neumarkt has created some controversy, with architecture critic Andreas Ruby criticising the attempt to reconstruct the historic character of the city as inauthentic, likening it to the recreation of Venice to be found at the [[The Venetian, Las Vegas|Venetian Resort Hotel]] in [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zeit.de/2000/46/200046_dresden.xml/seite-1]&lt;/ref&gt;

There has also been extensive debate as to what extent contemporary architecture should be present on the rebuilt Neumarkt.

'''Paul Zumthor''', {{Post-nominals|country=CAN|CQ}} (August 5, 1915 &amp;ndash; January 11, 1995)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.babelio.com/auteur/Paul-Zumthor/9896&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Literature in Canada|author=William H. New|publisher=University of Toronto Press|year=2002|isbn=0-8020-0761-9|page=1235}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a medievalist, literary historian and linguist. He was Swiss-born, from [[Geneva]].

==Biography==
He studied in Paris with [[Gustave Cohen]], and worked on French etymology with [[Walther von Wartburg]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.biografiasyvidas.com/biografia/z/zumthor.htm, in Spanish.&lt;/ref&gt; In studying medieval French poetry, he formulated the concept of ''mouvance'' (variability).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.answers.com/topic/paul-zumthor&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.soton.ac.uk/~wpwt/mouvance/mouvance.htm What is 'mouvance'?&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]; Cynthia J. Brown, "Variance and Late Medieval ''Mouvance'': Reading an Edition of Georges Chastellain's 'Louange à la tresglorieuse Vierge,' in: ''Translation, Transformation, and Transubstantiation'', ed. Carol Poster and Richard Utz (Evanston: IL: Northwestern University Press, 1998), pp. 123-75."&lt;/ref&gt; He also emphasised "vocality" in medieval poetry, the place of the [[human voice]].&lt;ref&gt;Leslie C. Dunn, Nancy A. Jones, ''Embodied Voices: Representing Female Vocality in Western Culture'' (1994), p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
He held two major professorial positions, at the [[University of Amsterdam]] from 1952 and at the [[Université de Montréal]] from 1971 to 1980, when he became emeritus. In 1992, he was made a Knight of the [[National Order of Quebec]].

==Legacy==
Within [[J. M. Coetzee]]'s novel ''[[Elizabeth Costello]]'', Zumthor is quoted at length by a character Emmanuel Egudu. Coetzee writes of Zumthor as "a man from the snowy wastes of Canada, the great scholar of orality Paul Zumthor."&lt;ref&gt;J. M. Coetzee, ''Elizabeth Costello'': pg. 45 Vintage Books, 2004. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Persian literature''' ({{lang-fa|ادبیات فارسی}}, ''Adabiyât-i fârsi'') comprises oral compositions and written texts in the [[Persian language]] and it is one of the world's oldest [[literature]]s.&lt;ref name=Spooner1994&gt;{{cite book|last1=Spooner|first1=Brian|editor1-last=Marashi|editor1-first=Mehdi|title=Persian Studies in North America: Studies in Honor of Mohammad Ali Jazayery|date=1994|publisher=Brill|location=Leiden|pages=177–178|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nSdsnqWpuh4C&amp;pg=PA177|chapter=Dari, Farsi, and Tojiki}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Spooner2012&gt;{{cite book|last1=Spooner|first1=Brian|editor1-last=Schiffman|editor1-first=Harold|title=Language policy and language conflict in Afghanistan and its neighbors: the changing politics of language choice|date=2012|publisher=Brill|location=Leiden|page=94|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=52aicl9l7rwC&amp;pg=PA94|chapter=Dari, Farsi, and Tojiki}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CWL2013&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Campbell|editor1-first=George L.|editor2-last=King|editor2-first=Gareth|title=Compendium of the World's Languages|date=2013|publisher=Routledge|page=1339|edition=3rd|chapter=Persian|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DWAqAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA1339}}&lt;/ref&gt; It spans over two-and-a-half millennia. Its sources have been within [[Greater Iran]] including present-day [[Iran]], [[Iraq]], [[Afghanistan]], the [[Caucasus]], and [[Turkey]], regions of [[Central Asia]] (such as [[Tajikistan]]) and [[South Asia]] where the [[Persian language]] has historically been either the native or official language. For instance, [[Rumi]], one of best-loved Persian poets born in [[Balkh]] (in what is now the modern-day [[Afghanistan]]) or [[Vakhsh, Tajikistan|Vakhsh]] (in what is now the modern-day [[Tajikistan]]), wrote in Persian and lived in [[Konya]], then the capital of the [[Seljuks]] in Anatolia. The [[Ghaznavids]] conquered large territories in Central and [[South Asia]] and adopted Persian as their court language. There is thus Persian literature from Iran, [[Mesopotamia]], [[Azerbaijan]], the wider Caucasus, Turkey, western parts of [[Pakistan]], [[India]], [[Tajikistan]] and other parts of Central Asia. Not all Persian literature is written in [[Persian language|Persian]], as some consider works written by ethnic [[Persian people|Persians]] in other languages, such as [[Greek language|Greek]] and [[Arabic language|Arabic]], to be included. At the same time, not all literature written in Persian is written by ethnic Persians or Iranians, as Turkic, Caucasian, and Indic poets and writers have also used the Persian language in the environment of [[Persianate]] cultures.

Described as one of the great literatures of humanity,&lt;ref&gt;Arthur John Arberry, ''The Legacy of Persia'', Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1953, {{ISBN|0-19-821905-9}}, p. 200.&lt;/ref&gt; including [[Goethe]]'s assessment of it as one of the four main bodies of world literature,&lt;ref&gt;Von David Levinson; Karen Christensen, ''Encyclopedia of Modern Asia'', Charles Scribner's Sons. 2002, vol. 4, p. 480&lt;/ref&gt; Persian literature has its roots in surviving works of [[Middle Persian]] and [[Old Persian]], the latter of which date back as far as 522&amp;nbsp;BCE, the date of the earliest surviving [[Achaemenid]] inscription, the [[Behistun Inscription]]. The bulk of surviving Persian literature, however, comes from the times following the [[Arab conquest of Persia]] c. 650&amp;nbsp;CE. After the [[Abbasid]]s came to power (750 CE), the Iranians became the scribes and bureaucrats of the Arab empire and, increasingly, also its writers and poets. The New Persian language literature arose and flourished in [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]] and [[Transoxiana]] because of political reasons, early Iranian dynasties such as the [[Tahirids]] and [[Samanids]] being based in Khorasan.&lt;ref&gt;Frye, R. N., "Darī", ''The Encyclopaedia of Islam'', Brill Publications, CD version.&lt;/ref&gt;

Persian poets such as [[Ferdowsi]], [[Saadi (poet)|Sa'di]], [[Hafiz Shirazi|Hafiz]], [[Attar of Nishapur|Attar]], [[Nezami Ganjavi|Nezami]],&lt;ref&gt;C. A. (Charles Ambrose) Storey and Franço de Blois (2004), "Persian Literature - A Biobibliographical Survey: Volume V Poetry of the Pre-Mongol Period", RoutledgeCurzon; 2nd revised edition (June 21, 2004). p. 363: "Nizami Ganja’i, whose personal name was Ilyas, is the most celebrated native poet of the Persians after Firdausi. His nisbah designates him as a native of Ganja (Elizavetpol, Kirovabad) in Azerbaijan, then still a country with an Iranian population, and he spent the whole of his life in Transcaucasia; the verse in some of his poetic works which makes him a native of the hinterland of Qom is a spurious interpolation."&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jalal ad-Din Muhammad Rumi|Rumi]]&lt;ref&gt;Franklin Lewis, Rumi Past and Present, East and West, Oneworld Publications, 2000. How is it that a Persian boy born almost eight hundred years ago in Khorasan, the northeastern province of greater Iran, in a region that we identify today as Central Asia, but was considered in those days as part of the Greater Persian cultural sphere, wound up in Central Anatolia on the receding edge of the Byzantine cultural sphere, in which is now Turkey, some 1500 miles to the west? (p. 9)&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Omar Khayyám|Omar Khayyam]] are also known in the West and have influenced the literature of many countries.

== Classical Persian literature ==
=== Pre-Islamic Persian literature ===
{{See also |Pahlavi literature}}

Very few literary works of [[Achaemenid]] Iran have survived, due partly to the destruction of the library at Persepolis.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=VW-rtv9te8cC&amp;pg=PA23&amp;dq=persepolis+library&amp;sig=ACfU3U2SEJceoGGAKOtfYReZJJwnPr2X4w Encyclopedia of Library and ... - Google Books&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Most of what remains consists of the royal inscriptions of [[Achaemenid Empire|Achaemenid]] kings, particularly [[Darius I]] (522–486 BC) and his son [[Xerxes I of Persia|Xerxes]]. Many [[Zoroastrian]] writings were destroyed in the [[Islamic conquest of Iran]] in the 7th century. The [[Parsi people|Parsis]] who fled to [[India]], however, took with them some of the books of the Zoroastrian canon, including some of the [[Avesta]] and ancient commentaries (''Zend'') thereof. Some works of [[Sassanid]] geography and travel also survived, albeit in Arabic translations.

No single text devoted to [[literary criticism]] has survived from [[Pre-Islamic Iran]]. However, some essays in [[Zoroastrian Middle Persian|Pahlavi]], such as "Ayin-e name nebeshtan" (Principles of Writing Book) and "Bab-e edteda’I-ye" ([[Panchatantra|Kalileh o Demneh]]), have been considered as literary criticism (Zarrinkoub, 1959).&lt;ref&gt;Abdolhossein Zarrinkoub, ''Naqde adabi'', Tehran 1959 pp: 374–379.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some researchers have quoted the ''Sho'ubiyye'' as asserting that the Pre-Islamic Iranians had books on eloquence, such as 'Karvand'. No trace remains of such books. There are some indications that some among the Persian elite were familiar with Greek rhetoric and literary criticism (Zarrinkoub, 1947).

=== Persian literature of the medieval and pre-modern periods ===
[[File:Brooklyn Museum - Bahram Gur and Courtiers Entertained by Barbad the Musician Page from a manuscript of the Shahnama of Firdawsi (d. 1020).jpg|thumbnail|''[[Bahram Gur]] and Courtiers Entertained by [[Barbad]] the Musician'', Page from a manuscript of the [[Shahnama]] of [[Ferdowsi]]. [[Brooklyn Museum]].]]

While initially [[Islamization of Iran|overshadowed by Arabic]] during the [[Umayyad]] and early [[Abbasid]] caliphates, [[Persian language|New Persian]] soon became a literary language again of the [[Central Asia]]n and [[West Asian]] lands. The rebirth of the language in its new form is often accredited to [[Ferdowsi]], [[Unsuri]], [[Abu-Mansur Daqiqi|Daqiqi]], [[Rudaki]], and their generation, as they used Pre-Islamic nationalism as a conduit to revive the language and customs of ancient [[Iran]].

==== Poetry ====
{{Further|Persian metres}}
[[File:Bowl of Reflections, early 13th century.jpg|thumbnail|''Bowl of Reflections'', early 13th century. [[Brooklyn Museum]]]]

So strong is the Persian inclination to versifying everyday expressions that one can encounter poetry in almost every classical work, whether from Persian literature, science, or metaphysics. In short, the ability to write in verse form was a pre-requisite for any scholar. For example, almost half of [[Avicenna]]'s medical writings are in verse.

Works of the early era of Persian poetry are characterized by strong court patronage, an extravagance of [[panegyrics]], and what is known as &lt;big&gt;سبک فاخر&lt;/big&gt; "exalted in style". The tradition of royal patronage began perhaps under the [[Sassanid Empire|Sassanid]] era and carried over through the [[Abbasid]] and [[Samanid dynasty|Samanid]] courts into every major [[List of kings of Persia|Iranian dynasty]]. The [[Qasida]] was perhaps the most famous form of panegyric used, though [[quatrain]]s such as those in [[Omar Khayyám|Omar Khayyam]]'s [[Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam|Ruba'iyyat]] are also widely popular.

[[Khorasani style (poetry)|Khorasani style]], whose followers mostly were associated with [[Greater Khorasan]], is characterized by its supercilious diction, dignified tone, and relatively literate language. The chief representatives of this lyricism are [[Asjadi]], [[Farrukhi Sistani]], [[Unsuri]], and [[Manuchihri|Manuchehri]]. Panegyric masters such as [[Rudaki]] were known for their love of nature, their verse abounding with evocative descriptions.

Through these courts and system of patronage emerged the epic style of poetry, with [[Ferdowsi]]'s ''[[Shahnama]]'' at the apex. By glorifying the [[History of Iran|Iranian historical past]] in heroic and elevated verses, he and other notables such as [[Abu-Mansur Daqiqi|Daqiqi]] and [[Asadi Tusi]] presented the "[[Ajam]]" with a source of pride and inspiration that has helped preserve a sense of identity for the [[Iranian peoples|Iranian People]] over the ages. Ferdowsi set a model to be followed by a host of other poets later on.

The 13th century marks the ascendancy of lyric poetry with the consequent development of the [[ghazal]] into a major verse form, as well as the rise of mystical and [[Sufi poetry]]. This style is often called [[Araqi style (poetry)|Araqi (Iraqi) style]], (western provinces of Iran were known as [[The Persian Iraq]] (Araq-e-Ajam) and is known by its emotional lyric qualities, rich meters, and the relative simplicity of its language. Emotional romantic poetry was not something new however, as works such as [[Vis u Ramin|Vis o Ramin]] by [[Fakhruddin As'ad Gurgani|As'ad Gorgani]], and ''Yusof o Zoleikha'' by [[Am'aq]] Bokharai exemplify. Poets such as [[Sana'i]] and [[Farid al-Din Attar|Attar]] (who ostensibly have inspired [[Jalal ad-Din Muhammad Rumi|Rumi]]), [[Khaqani Shirvani]], [[Anvari]], and [[Nizami Ganjavi|Nizami]], were highly respected ghazal writers. However, the elite of this school are [[Jalal ad-Din Muhammad Rumi|Rumi]], [[Saadi (poet)|Sadi]], and [[Hafiz Shirazi]].

Regarding the tradition of Persian love poetry during the [[Safavid dynasty|Safavid]] era, Persian historian [[Ehsan Yarshater]] notes, "As a rule, the beloved is not a woman, but a young man. In the early centuries of Islam, the raids into [[Central Asia]] produced many young [[slavery|slaves]]. Slaves were also bought or received as gifts. They were made to serve as pages at court or in the households of the affluent, or as soldiers and bodyguards. Young men, slaves or not, also, served wine at banquets and receptions, and the more gifted among them could play music and maintain a cultivated conversation. It was [[LGBT topics and Islam|love toward young pages, soldiers, or novices in trades and professions]] which was the subject of lyrical introductions to panegyrics from the beginning of Persian poetry, and of the ghazal. "&lt;ref&gt;Yar-Shater, Ehsan. 1986. ''Persian Poetry in the Timurid and Safavid Periods, '' Cambridge History of Iran. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, pp. 973-974. 1986&lt;/ref&gt;
During the same Safavid era, many subjects of the Iranian Safavids were patrons of Persian poetry, such as [[Teimuraz I of Kakheti]].

In the [[didactic]] genre one can mention [[Sanai]]'s ''Hadiqat-ul-Haqiqah'' (Garden of Truth) as well as [[Nizami Ganjavi|Nizami]]'s ''Makhzan-ul-Asrār'' (Treasury of Secrets). Some of [[Farid al-Din Attar|Attar]]'s works also belong to this genre as do the major works of [[Jalal ad-Din Muhammad Rumi|Rumi]], although some tend to classify these in the lyrical type due to their mystical and emotional qualities. In addition, some tend to group [[Naser Khosrow]]'s works in this style as well; however true gems of this genre are two books by [[Saadi (poet)|Sadi]], a heavyweight of Persian literature, the ''[[Bostan (book)|Bustan]]'' and the ''[[Gulistan of Sa'di|Gulistan]]''.

After the 15th century, the [[Indian style (poetry)|Indian style]] of Persian poetry (sometimes also called ''Isfahani'' or ''Safavi'' styles) took over. This style has its roots in the [[Timurid dynasty|Timurid]] era and produced the likes of [[Amir Khusro|Amir Khosrow Dehlavi]], and Bhai [[Nand Lal Goya]].

==== Prose writings ====
The most significant prose writings of this era are [[Nizami Aruzi|Nizami Arudhi Samarqandi]]'s ''"Chahār Maqāleh"'' as well as [[Zahiriddin Nasr Muhammad Aufi]]'s [[anecdote]] compendium ''[[Jawami ul-Hikayat]]''.
[[Shams al-Mo'ali Abol-hasan Ghaboos ibn Wushmgir]]'s famous work, the ''[[Qabus nama]]'' (''A Mirror for Princes''), is a highly esteemed [[Belles-lettres]] work of Persian literature. Also highly regarded is ''[[Siyasatnama]]'', by [[Nizam al-Mulk]], a famous Persian [[vizier]]. ''[[Panchatantra|Kelileh va Demneh]]'', translated from [[India]]n folk tales, can also be mentioned in this category. It is seen as a collection of adages in Persian literary studies and thus does not convey folkloric notions.

==== Biographies, hagiographies, and historical works ====
Among the major historical and biographical works in classical Persian, one can mention [[Abolfazl Beyhaqi|Abolfazl Beyhaghi]]'s famous ''[[Tarikh-i Beyhaqi]]'', ''[[Lubab ul-Albab]]'' of [[Zahiriddin Nasr Muhammad Aufi]] (which has been regarded as a reliable chronological source by many experts), as well as [[Ata-Malik Juvayni]]'s famous ''[[Tarikh-i Jahangushay-i Juvaini]]'' (which spans the Mongolid and [[Ilkhanate|Ilkhanid]] era of [[Iran]]). [[Farid al-Din Attar|Attar]]'s ''[[Tazkerat-ol-Owliya]]'' ("Biographies of the Saints") is also a detailed account of [[Sufi]] mystics, which is referenced by many subsequent authors and considered a significant work in mystical [[hagiography]].

==== Literary criticism ====
{{See also|Literary criticism in Iran}}

The oldest surviving work of Persian literary criticism after the Islamic conquest of Persia is ''Muqaddame-ye Shahname-ye Abu Mansuri'', which was written during the [[Samanids|Samanid period]].&lt;ref&gt;Iraj Parsinejad, ''A History of Literary Criticism in Iran, 1866-1951'', (Ibex Publishers, Inc., 2003), 14.&lt;/ref&gt; The work deals with the myths and legends of [[Shahnameh|Shahname]] and is considered the oldest surviving example of Persian prose. It also shows an attempt by the authors to evaluate literary works critically.

==== Storytelling ====
''[[One Thousand and One Nights]]'' ({{lang-fa|هزار و یک شب}}) is a medieval [[Folklore|folk tale]] collection which tells the story of [[Scheherazade]] ({{lang-fa|شهرزاد}} ''Šahrzād''), a [[Sassanid Empire|Sassanid]] queen who must relate a series of stories to her malevolent husband, King [[List of One Thousand and One Nights characters#Shahryār|Shahryar]] ({{lang-fa|شهریار}} ''Šahryār''), to delay her execution. The stories are told over a period of one thousand and one nights, and every night she ends the story with a suspenseful situation, forcing the King to keep her alive for another day.  The individual stories were created over several centuries, by many people from a number of different lands.

The nucleus of the collection is formed by a [[Zoroastrian Middle Persian|Pahlavi]] Sassanid [[Persian language|Persian]] book called ''Hazār Afsānah''&lt;ref&gt;Abdol Hossein Saeedian, ''"Land and People of Iran"'' p. 447&lt;/ref&gt; ({{lang-fa|هزار افسان}}, ''Thousand Myths''), a collection of ancient Indian and Persian folk tales.

During the reign of the [[Abbasid]] [[Caliph]] [[Harun al-Rashid]] in the 8th century, [[Baghdad]] had become an important cosmopolitan city. Merchants from [[Persian Empire|Persia]], [[China]], [[India]], Africa, and Europe were all found in Baghdad. During this time, many of the stories that were originally folk stories are thought to have been collected orally over many years and later compiled into a single book. The compiler and 9th-century translator into Arabic is reputedly the storyteller ''Abu Abd-Allah Muhammad el-Gahshigar''. The [[frame story]] of Shahrzad seems to have been added in the 14th century.

== Dictionaries ==
The biggest Persian dictionary is ''[[Dehkhoda Dictionary]]'' (16 volumes) by
[[Ali-Akbar Dehkhoda]]. It is the largest comprehensive [[Persian language|Persian]] [[dictionary]] ever published, comprising 16 volumes (more than 27000 pages). It is published by the [[University of Tehran Press| Tehran University Press (UTP)]] under the supervision of the [[Dehkhoda Dictionary Institute]]. It traces the historical development of the Persian language, providing a comprehensive resource to scholars and academic researchers, as well as describing usage in its many variations throughout the world.
He names 200 Persian lexicographical works in his dictionary, the earliest, ''[[Frahang-i Oim-evak|Farhang-i Oim]]'' ({{lang|fa|فرهنگ اویم}}) and ''Farhang-i Menakhtay'' ({{lang|fa|فرهنگ مناختای}}), from the late [[Sassanid Empire|Sassanid]] era.

The most widely used Persian [[lexicon]]s in the [[Middle Ages]] were those of [[Abu Hafs Soghdi]] ({{lang|fa|فرهنگ ابوحفص سغدی}}) and [[Asadi Tusi]] ({{lang|fa|فرهنگ لغت فرس}}), written in 1092.

Also highly regarded in the contemporary Persian literature lexical corpus are the works of Dr. [[Mohammad Moin]]. The first volume of Moin Dictionary was published in 1963.

In 1645, [[Christian Ravius]] completed a Persian-[[Latin]] dictionary, printed at Leiden. This was followed by [[J. Richardson]]'s two-volume Oxford edition (1777) and Gladwin-Malda's (1770) Persian-English Dictionaries, Scharif and S. Peters' Persian-Russian Dictionary (1869), and 30 other Persian lexicographical translations through the 1950s.

Currently English-Persian dictionaries of [[Manouchehr Aryanpour]] and [[Soleiman Haim]] are widely used in Iran.

== The influence of Persian literature on World literature ==
=== Sufi literature ===

[[William Shakespeare]] referred to Iran as the "land of the Sophy".&lt;ref&gt;See William Shakespeare's ''[[The Twelfth Night]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; Some of Persia's best-beloved medieval poets were [[Sufism|Sufis]], and their poetry was, and is, widely read by Sufis from [[Morocco]] to [[Indonesia]]. [[Jalal ad-Din Muhammad Balkhi|Rumi]] (Maulānā ), in particular is renowned both as a poet and as the founder of a widespread Sufi order. The themes and styles of this devotional poetry have been widely imitated by many Sufi poets. See also the article on [[Sufi poetry]].

Many notable texts in Persian mystic literature are not poems, yet highly read and regarded. Among those are ''[[Kimiya-yi sa'ādat]]'', ''[[Asrar al-Tawhid]]'' and ''[[Kashf ul Mahjoob]]''.

=== Georgian literature ===
[[File:Georgian manuscript (Shahname).jpg|thumb|Georgian manuscript of Shahnameh written in the [[Georgian script]].]]

Starting from the early 16th century, Persian traditions had a large impact on Georgian ruling elites, which in turn resulted in Persian influence on Georgian art, architecture and literature.&lt;ref name="Willem Floor p 494"&gt;Willem Floor, Edmund Herzig.

[[Jamshid Giunashvili|Jamshid Sh. Giunashvili]] remarks on the connection of [[Georgian culture]] with that of the Persian literary work ''[[Shahnameh]]'':

{{quote|The names of many ''Šāh-nāma'' heroes, such as [[Rostam|Rostom-i]], Thehmine, [[Sām|Sam-i]], or [[Zal|Zaal-i]], are found in 11th- and 12th-century [[Georgian literature]]. They are indirect evidence for an Old Georgian translation of the ''Šāh-nāma'' that is no longer extant. ...}}

{{quote|The ''Šāh-nāma'' was translated, not only to satisfy the literary and aesthetic needs of readers and listeners, but also to inspire the young with the spirit of heroism and Georgian patriotism. Georgian ideology, customs, and worldview often informed these translations because they were oriented toward Georgian poetic culture. Conversely, Georgians consider these translations works of their native literature. Georgian versions of the ''Šāh-nāma'' are quite popular, and the stories of [[Rostam and Sohrab|Rostam and Sohrāb]], or [[Bijan and Manijeh|Bījan and Maniža]] became part of Georgian folklore.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Giunshvili|first=Jamshid Sh.|title=Šāh-nāma Translations ii.

Farmanfarmaian in the ''[[Journal of Persianate Studies]]'':

{{quote|Distinguished scholars of Persian such as Gvakharia and Todua are well aware that the inspiration derived from the Persian classics of the ninth to the twelfth centuries produced a ‘cultural synthesis’ which saw, in the earliest stages of written secular literature in Georgia, the resumption of literary contacts with Iran, “much stronger than before” (Gvakharia, 2001, p. 481). Ferdowsi’s ''Shahnama'' was a never-ending source of inspiration, not only for high literature, but for folklore as well. “Almost every page of Georgian literary works and chronicles [...] contains names of Iranian heroes borrowed from the ''Shahnama''” (ibid). Ferdowsi, together with [[Nizami Ganjavi|Nezāmi]], may have left the most enduring imprint on Georgian literature (...){{sfn|Farmanfarmaian|2009|page=24}}}}

Despite that [[Asia Minor]] (or [[Anatolia]]) had been ruled various times prior to the Middle Ages by various Persian-speaking dynasties originating in Iran, the language lost its traditional foothold there with the demise of the [[Sassanian Empire]].

==== South Asia ====
{{See also|Indo-Persian culture}}

With the emergence of the [[Ghaznavids|Ghaznavid]]s and their successors such as the [[Ghurids]], [[Timurid dynasty|Timurids]] and [[Mughal Empire]], [[Culture of Iran|Persian culture]] and its literature gradually moved into [[South Asia]] too. In general, from its earliest days, Persian literature and language was imported into the subcontinent by culturally Persianised [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] and [[Afghanistan|Afghan]] dynasties. Persian became the language of the nobility, literary circles, and the royal Mughal courts for hundreds of years. In the early 19th century, [[Hindustani language|Hindustani]] replaced it.

Under the Moghul Empire of India during the 16th century, the official language of India became Persian. Only in 1832 did the British army force the South Asia to begin conducting business in English. &lt;small&gt;''(Clawson, p.&amp;nbsp; 6)''&lt;/small&gt; Persian poetry in fact flourished in these regions while post-[[Safavid dynasty|Safavid]] [[Iran]]ian literature stagnated. [[Ali-Akbar Dehkhoda|Dehkhoda]] and other scholars of the 20th century, for example, largely based their works on the detailed lexicography produced in India, using compilations such as [[Ghazi khan Badr Muhammad Dehlavi]]'s ''Adat al-Fudhala'' ({{lang|fa|اداة الفضلا}}), [[Ibrahim Ghavamuddin Farughi]]'s ''Farhang-i Ibrahimi'' ({{lang|fa|فرهنگ ابراهیمی}}), and particularly Muhammad Padshah's ''Farhang-i Anandraj'' ({{lang|fa|فرهنگ آناندراج}}).

=== Western literature ===
{{main article|Persian literature in the West}}

Persian literature was little known in the West before the 18-19th century. It became much better known following the publication of several translations from the works of late medieval Persian poets, and it inspired works by various Western poets and writers.

==== German literature ====
* In 1819, [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]] published his ''[[West-östlicher Divan]]'', a collection of lyric poems inspired by a German translation of [[Hafiz Shirazi|Hafiz]] (1326–1390).
* The German essayist and philosopher [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche]] was the author of the book ''[[Thus Spoke Zarathustra]]'' (1883–1885),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

| accessdate=2006-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; referring to the ancient Persian prophet [[Zoroaster]] (c. 1700 BCE).

==== English literature ====
* A selection from [[Ferdowsi]]'s [[Shahnameh]] (935–1020) was published in 1832 by [[James Atkinson (Persian scholar)|James Atkinson]], a physician employed by the [[Honourable East India Company|British East India Company]].
* A portion of this abridgment was later versified by the British poet Matthew Arnold in his 1853 ''Rustam and Sohrab''.
* The American poet [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]] was another admirer of Persian poetry. He published several essays in 1876 that discuss Persian poetry: ''Letters and Social Aims'', ''From the Persian of Hafiz'', and ''Ghaselle''.

Perhaps the most popular Persian poet of the 19th and early 20th centuries was [[Omar Khayyám|Omar Khayyam]] (1048–1123), whose ''[[Rubaiyat (Khayyam)|Rubaiyat]]'' was freely translated by [[Edward FitzGerald (poet)|Edward Fitzgerald]] in 1859. Khayyam is esteemed more as a scientist than a poet in his native Persia, but in Fitzgerald's rendering, he became one of the most quoted poets in English. Khayyam's line, "A loaf of bread, a jug of wine, and thou", is known to many who could not say who wrote it, or where:
{{Verse translation|italicsoff=y|rtl1=y|
{{lang|fa|rtl=yes|گر دست دهد ز مغز گندم نانی
وز می دو منی ز گوسفندی رانی
وانگه من و تو نشسته در ویرانی

|
Ah, would there were a loaf of bread as fare,
A joint of lamb, a jug of vintage rare,
And you and I in wilderness encamped—
No [[Sultan]]'s pleasure could with ours compare.}}

The Persian poet and mystic [[Jalal ad-Din Muhammad Rumi|Rumi]] (1207–1273) (known as Molana in Iran, Afghanistan and Tajikistan; and as Mevlana in Turkey), has attracted a large following in the late 20th and early 21st centuries. Popularizing translations by [[Coleman Barks]] have presented Rumi as a [[New Age]] sage. There are also a number of more literary translations by scholars such as [[Arthur John Arberry|A. J. Arberry]].

The classical poets (Hafiz, [[Saadi (poet)|Sa'di]], Khayyam, Rumi, [[Nizami Ganjavi|Nizami]] and [[Ferdowsi]]) are now widely known in English and can be read in various translations. Other works of Persian literature are untranslated and little known.

==== Swedish literature ====
During the last century, numerous works of classical Persian literature have been translated into [[Swedish language|Swedish]] by baron [[Eric Hermelin]]. He translated works by, among others, [[Farid al-Din Attar]], [[Jalal ad-Din Muhammad Rumi|Rumi]], [[Ferdowsi]], [[Omar Khayyám|Omar Khayyam]], Sa'adi and [[Sanai|Sana'i]]. Influenced by the writings of the [[Sweden|Swedish]] mystic [[Emanuel Swedenborg]], he was especially attracted to the religious or [[Sufism|Sufi]] aspects of classical Persian poetry. His translations have had a great impact on numerous modern Swedish writers, among them [[Karl Wennberg]], [[Willy Kyrklund]] and [[Gunnar Ekelöf]]. More recently classical authors such as [[Hafez]], [[Rumi]], [[Fakhr-al-Din Iraqi|Araqi]] and [[Nizami Aruzi]] has been rendered into Swedish by the [[iranist]] [[Ashk Dahlén]], who has published several essays on the development of Persian literature. Excerpts from [[Ferdousi]]'s ''[[Shahnama]]'' has also been translated into [[Swedish language|Swedish]] [[prose]] by Namdar Nasser and Anja Malmberg.

==== Italian literature ====
During the last century, numerous works of classical Persian literature have been translated into [[Italian language|Italian]] by Alessandro Bausani (Nizami, Rumi, Iqbal, Khayyam), Carlo Saccone ('Attar, Sana'i, Hafiz, Nasir-i Khusraw, Nizami, Ahmad Ghazali, Ansari of Herat), Angelo Piemontese (Amir Khusraw Dihlavi), Pio Filippani-Ronconi (Nasir-i Khusraw, Sa'di), Riccardo Zipoli (Kay Ka'us, Bidil), Maurizio Pistoso (Nizam al-Mulk), Giorgio Vercellin (Nizami 'Aruzi), Giovanni Maria D'Erme ('Ubayd Zakani, Hafiz), Sergio Foti (Suhrawardi, Rumi, Jami), Rita Bargigli (Sa'di, Farrukhi, Manuchehri, 'Unsuri), Nahid Norozi (Sohrab Sepehri, Khwaju of Kerman, Ahmad Shamlu), Faezeh Mardani (Forugh Farrokhzad, Abbas Kiarostami). A complete translation of Firdawsi's ''Shah-nama'' was made by Italo Pizzi in the 19th century.

== Contemporary Persian literature ==
=== History ===

In the 19th century, Persian literature experienced dramatic change and entered a new era. The beginning of this change was exemplified by an incident in the mid-19th century at the court of [[Nasser al-Din Shah Qajar|Nasereddin Shah]], when the reform-minded prime minister, [[Amir Kabir]], chastised the poet [[Habibollah Qa'ani]] for "lying" in a panegyric qasida written in Kabir's honor. Kabir saw poetry in general and the type of poetry that had developed during the Qajar period as detrimental to "progress" and "modernization" in Iranian society, which he believed was in dire need of change. Such concerns were also expressed by others such as [[Fath-'Ali Akhundzadeh]], [[Mirza Aqa Khan Kermani]], and [[Mirza Malkom Khan]]. Khan also addressed a need for a change in Persian poetry in literary terms as well, always linking it to social concerns.

[[File:HedayatParis1306.jpg|thumb|"In life there are certain sores which slowly erode the mind in solitude like a kind of canker. " ''[[The Blind Owl]]'']]
The new Persian literary movement cannot be understood without an understanding of the [[Intellectual movements in Iran|intellectual movements]] among Iranian philosophical circles. Given the social and political climate of Persia (Iran) in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, which led to the [[Iranian Constitutional Revolution|Persian Constitutional Revolution]] of 1906–1911, the idea that change in poetry was necessary became widespread. Many argued that Persian poetry should reflect the realities of a country in transition. This idea was propagated by notable literary figures such as [[Ali-Akbar Dehkhoda]] and [[Aref Qazvini|Abolqasem Aref]], who challenged the traditional system of Persian poetry in terms of introducing new content and experimentation with rhetoric, lexico-semantics, and structure. Dehkhoda, for instance, used a lesser-known traditional form, the mosammat, to elegize the execution of a revolutionary journalist. 'Aref employed the ghazal, "the most central genre within the lyrical tradition" (p.&amp;nbsp; 88), to write his "Payam-e Azadi" (Message of Freedom).

Some researchers argue that the notion of "sociopolitical ramifications of esthaetic changes" led to the idea of poets "as social leaders trying the limits and possibilities of social change".&lt;!-- Quotation source? --&gt;

An important movement in modern Persian literature centered on the question of [[modernization]] and [[Westernization]] and whether these terms are synonymous when describing the evolution of Iranian society. It can be argued that almost all advocates of modernism in Persian literature, from Akhundzadeh, Kermani, and Malkom Khan to Dehkhoda, Aref, Bahar, and [[Taqi Rafat]], were inspired by developments and changes that had occurred in Western, particularly European, literatures. Such inspirations did not mean blindly copying Western models but, rather, adapting aspects of Western literature and changing them to fit the needs of Iranian culture.

Following the pioneering works of [[Ahmad Kasravi]], [[Sadeq Hedayat]], [[Moshfeq Kazemi]] and many others, the Iranian wave of comparative literature and literary criticism reached a symbolic crest with the emergence of [[Abdolhossein Zarrinkoob|Abdolhossein Zarrinkoub]], [[Shahrokh Meskoob]], [[Houshang Golshiri]] and [[Ebrahim Golestan]].

=== In Afghanistan ===
Persian literature in Afghanistan has also experienced a dramatic change during the last century. At the beginning of the 20th century, Afghanistan was confronted with economic and social change, which sparked a new approach to literature. In 1911, [[Mahmud Tarzi]], who came back to Afghanistan after years of exile in Turkey and was influential in government circles, started a fortnightly publication named ''Saraj’ul Akhbar''. ''Saraj'' was not the first such publication in the country, but in the field of journalism and literature it launched a new period of change and modernization. ''Saraj'' not only played an important role in journalism, it also gave new life to literature as a whole and opened the way for poetry to explore new avenues of expression through which personal thoughts took on a more social colour.

In 1930 (1309 AH), after months of cultural stagnation, a group of writers founded the Herat Literary Circle. A year later, another group calling itself the Kabul Literary Circle was founded in the capital. Both groups published regular magazines dedicated to culture and Persian literature. Both, especially the Kabul publication, had little success in becoming venues for modern Persian poetry and writing. In time, the Kabul publication turned into a stronghold for traditional writers and poets, and modernism in [[Dari literature]] was pushed to the fringes of social and cultural life.

Three of the most prominent classical poets in Afghanistan at the time were [[Qari Abdullah]], [[Abdul Haq Betab]] and [[Khalilullah Khalili|Khalil Ullah Khalili]]. The first two received the honorary title ''Malek ul Shoara'' (King of Poets). Khalili, the third and youngest, was drawn toward the ''Khorasan style'' of poetry instead of the usual ''Hendi style''. He was also interested in modern poetry and wrote a few poems in a more modern style with new aspects of thought and meaning. In 1318 (AH)&lt;!-- Western date? --&gt;, after two poems by [[Nima Youshij]] titled "Gharab" and "Ghoghnus" were published, Khalili wrote a poem under the name "Sorude Kuhestan" or "The Song of the Mountain" in the same rhyming pattern as Nima and sent it to the Kabul Literary Circle. The traditionalists in Kabul refused to publish it because it was not written in the traditional rhyme. They criticized Khalili for modernizing his style.

Very gradually new styles found their way into literature and literary circles despite the efforts of traditionalists. The first book of new poems was published in the year 1957 (1336 AH), and in 1962 (1341 AH), a collection of modern Persian (Dari) poetry was published in Kabul. The first group to write poems in the new style consisted of [[Mahmud Farani]], [[Baregh Shafi’i]], [[Solayman Layeq]], [[Sohail]], [[Ayeneh]] and a few others. Later, [[Wasef Bakhtari|Vasef Bakhtari]], [[Asadullah Habib]] and [[Latif Nazemi]], and others joined the group. Each had his own share in modernizing Persian poetry in Afghanistan. Other notable figures include [[Leila Sarahat Roshani]], [[Sayed Elan Bahar]] and [[Parwin Pazwak]]. Poets like [[Vladimir Mayakovsky|Mayakovsky]], [[Yase Nien]] and [[Lahouti]] (an Iranian poet living in exile in Russia) exerted a special influence on the Persian poets in Afghanistan. The influence of Iranians (e.g. [[Mohammad Farrokhi Yazdi|Farrokhi Yazdi]] and [[Ahmad Shamlou]]) on the newly established Afghan prose and poetry, especially in the second half of the 20th century, must also be taken into consideration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.qantara.de/uploads/540/FWF_78_Persian_Literature_in_Afghanistan.pdf |title=Latif Nazemi ''"A Look at Persian Literature in Afghanistan"'' |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080227020705/http://www.qantara.de/uploads/540/FWF_78_Persian_Literature_in_Afghanistan.pdf |archivedate=2008-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prominent writers from Afghanistan like [[Asef Soltanzadeh]], [[Reza Ebrahimi, Ameneh Mohammadi]], and [[Abbas Jafari]] grew up in Iran and were influenced by Iranian writers and teachers.

=== In Tajikistan ===
The new poetry in Tajikistan is mostly concerned with the way of life of people and is revolutionary. From the 1950s until the advent of new poetry in France, Asia and Latin America, the impact of the modernization drive was strong. In the 1960s, modern Iranian poetry and that of [[Mohammad Iqbal Lahouri]] made a profound impression in Tajik poetry. This period is probably the richest and most prolific period for the development of themes and forms in Persian poetry in Tajikistan. Some Tajik poets were mere imitators, and one can easily see the traits of foreign poets in their work. Only two or three poets were able to digest the foreign poetry and compose original poetry. In Tajikistan, the format and pictorial aspects of short stories and novels were taken from Russian and other European literature. Some of [[Tajikistan]]'s prominent names in Persian literature are [[Gulrukhsor Safieva|Golrokhsar Safi Eva]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Another critic, [[Ahmad Kasravi]], an experienced authority on literature, attacked the writers and poets whose works served despotism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Contemporary Persian [[literary criticism]] reached its maturity after [[Sadeq Hedayat]], [[Ebrahim Golestan]], [[Houshang Golshiri]], [[Abdolhossein Zarrinkoob|Abdolhossein Zarrinkoub]] and [[Shahrokh Meskoob]]. Among these figures, Zarrinkoub held academic positions and had a reputation not only among the intelligentsia but also in academia. Besides his significant contribution to the maturity of Persian language and literature, Zarrinkoub boosted [[comparative literature]] and Persian literary criticism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.persian-language.org/Group/Article.asp?ID=582&amp;P=4 AH Zarrinkoub: A biography]&lt;/ref&gt; Zarrinkoub's ''Serr e Ney'' is a critical and comparative analysis of [[Jalal ad-Din Muhammad Rumi|Rumi]]'s Masnavi. In turn, [[Shahrokh Meskoob]] worked on Ferdowsi’s [[Shahnameh]], using the principles of modern literary criticism.

[[Mohammad-Taqi Bahar|Mohammad Taghi Bahar]]'s main contribution to this field is his book called ''Sabk Shenasi'' (Stylistics). It is a pioneering work on the practice of Persian literary historiography and the emergence and development of Persian literature as a distinct institution in the early part of the 20th century. It contends that the exemplary status of Sabk-shinasi rests on the recognition of its disciplinary or institutional achievements. It further contends that, rather than a text on Persian ‘stylistics’, Sabk-shinasi is a vast history of Persian literary prose, and, as such, is a significant intervention in Persian literary historiography.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/1456717651-40441038/title~content=t713407085~db=all British Journal of Middle Eastern Studies&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jalal Homaei]], [[Badiozzaman Forouzanfar]] and his student, [[Mohammad-Reza Shafiei-Kadkani|Mohammad Reza Shafiei-Kadkani]], are other notable figures who have edited a number of prominent literary works.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

=== Persian short stories ===
{{History of literature by region or country}}
Historically, the modern Persian short story has undergone three stages of development: a formative period, a period of consolidation and growth, and a period of diversity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iranchamber.com/literature/articles/persian_short_story.php Houra Yavari, ''"The Persian Short Story"'']&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Period of diversity ====
In this period, the influence of the western literature on the Iranian writers and authors is obvious. The new and modern approaches to writing is introduced and several genres have developed specially in the field of short story. The most popular trends are toward [[post-modern]] methods and [[Persian Fantasy Academy|speculative fiction]].

=== Poetry ===
Notable Persian poets, modern and classical, include&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sharghnewspaper.com/850407/html/v2.htm&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mehdi Akhavan-Sales]], [[Simin Behbahani]], [[Forough Farrokhzad]], [[Mohammad Zohari]], [[Bijan Jalali]], [[Mina Assadi]], [[Siavash Kasraie]], [[Fereydoon Moshiri]], [[Nader Naderpour]], [[Sohrab Sepehri]], [[Mohammad-Reza Shafiei-Kadkani]], [[Ahmad Shamlou]], [[Nima Yooshij|Nima Yushij]], [[Hushang Ebtehaj|Houshang Ebtehaj]], [[Mirzadeh Eshghi]] (classical), [[Mohammad-Taqi Bahar|Mohammad Taghi Bahar]] (classical), [[Aref Ghazvini]] (classical), [[Parvin E'tesami|Parvin Etesami]] (classical), and [[Mohammad-Hossein Shahriar|Shahriar]] (classical).

==== Classical Persian poetry in modern times ====
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Mohammad Taghi Bahar.jpg|frame|M. T. Bahar, the greatest classical poet of modern times]] --&gt;A few notable classical poets have arisen since the 19th century, among whom Mohammad Taghi Bahar and Parvin Etesami have been most celebrated. Mohammad Taghi Bahar had the title "king of poets" and had a significant role in the emergence and development of Persian literature as a distinct institution in the early part of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/1456717651-40441038/title~content=t713407085~db=all Wali Ahmadi ''"The institution of Persian literature and the genealogy of Bahar's stylistics"'']&lt;/ref&gt; The theme of his poems was the social and political situation of Iran.

Parvin Etesami may be called the greatest Persian woman poet writing in the classical style. One of her remarkable series, called ''Mast va Hoshyar'' (The Drunk and the Sober), won admiration from many of those involved in romantic poetry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.irib.ir/occasions/etesami/etesamiEn.htm |title=Parvin Etesami's biography at IRIB.com |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080112185219/http://www2.irib.ir/occasions/etesami/etesamiEn.htm |archivedate=2008-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Modern Persian poetry ====
[[Nima Yooshij|Nima Yushij]] is considered the father of modern Persian poetry, introducing many techniques and forms to differentiate the modern from the old. Nevertheless, the credit for popularizing this new literary form within a country and culture solidly based on a thousand years of classical poetry goes to his few disciples such as Ahmad Shamlou, who adopted Nima's methods and tried new techniques of modern poetry.

The transformation brought about by Nima Youshij, who freed Persian poetry from the fetters of prosodic measures, was a turning point in a long literary tradition. It broadened the perception and thinking of the poets that came after him. Nima offered a different understanding of the principles of classical poetry. His artistry was not confined to removing the need for a fixed-length hemistich and dispensing with the tradition of rhyming but focused on a broader structure and function based on a contemporary understanding of human and social existence. His aim in renovating poetry was to commit it to a "natural identity" and to achieve a modern discipline in the mind and linguistic performance of the poet.&lt;ref name="Mansur Khaksar"&gt;[http://www.iran-bulletin.org/art/Shamlu_khaksar.html Mansur Khaksar ''"Shamlu’s poetic world"'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Nima held that the formal technique dominating classical poetry interfered with its vitality, vigor and progress. Although he accepted some of its aesthetic properties and extended them in his poetry, he never ceased to widen his poetic experience by emphasizing the "natural order" of this art. What Nima Youshij founded in contemporary poetry, his successor [[Ahmad Shamlou]] continued.

The [[Sepid Persian Poetry|Sepid poem]] (which translates to white poem), which draws its sources from this poet, avoided the compulsory rules which had entered the Nimai’ school of poetry and adopted a freer structure. This allowed a more direct relationship between the poet and his or her emotional roots. In previous poetry, the qualities of the poet’s vision as well as the span of the subject could only be expressed in general terms and were subsumed by the formal limitations imposed on poetic expression.
[[File:Pic-khalili.jpg|left|thumb|150px|[[Khalilollah Khalili]] on the cover of "Deewaan-e Khalilullah Khalili"]]
Nima’s poetry transgressed these limitations. It relied on the natural function inherent within poetry itself to portray the poet’s solidarity with life and the wide world surrounding him or her in specific and unambiguous details and scenes. Sepid poetry continues the poetic vision as Nima expressed it and avoids the contrived rules imposed on its creation. However, its most distinct difference with Nimai’ poetry is to move away from the rhythms it employed. Nima Youshij paid attention to an overall harmonious rhyming and created many experimental examples to achieve this end.&lt;ref name="Mansur Khaksar" /&gt;

Ahmad Shamlu discovered the inner characteristics of poetry and its manifestation in the literary creations of classical masters as well as the Nimai’ experience. He offered an individual approach. By distancing himself from the obligations imposed by older poetry and some of the limitations that had entered the Nimai’ poem, he recognized the role of prose and music hidden in the language. In the structure of Sepid poetry, in contrast to the prosodic and Nimai’ rules, the poem is written in more "natural" words and incorporates a prose-like process without losing its poetic distinction.
Sepid poetry is a developing branch of Nimai’ poetry built upon Nima Youshij's innovations. Nima thought that any change in the construction and the tools of a poet’s expression is conditional on his/her knowledge of the world and a revolutionized outlook. Sepid poetry could not take root outside this teaching and its application.

According to [[Simin Behbahani]], Sepid poetry did not receive general acceptance before [[Bijan Jalali]]'s works. He is considered the founder of Sepid poetry according to Behbahani.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Behbahani herself used the "Char Pareh" style of Nima, and subsequently turned to [[ghazal]], a free-flowing poetry style similar to the Western sonnet. Simin Behbahani contributed to a historic development in the form of the ghazal, as she added theatrical subjects, and daily events and conversations into her poetry. She has expanded the range of traditional Persian verse forms and produced some of the most significant works of Persian literature in the 20th century.

A reluctant follower of Nima Yushij, [[Mehdi Akhavan-Sales]] published his ''Organ'' (1951) to support contentions against Nima Yushij's groundbreaking endeavors. In Persian poetry, Mehdi Akhavan Sales has established a bridge between the ''Khorassani'' and ''Nima'' Schools. The critics consider Mehdi Akhavan Sales as one of the best contemporary Persian poets. He is one of the pioneers of free verse (new style poetry) in Persian literature, particularly of modern style epics. It was his ambition, for a long time, to introduce a fresh style to Persian poetry.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iranchamber.com/literature/makhavansales/mehdi_akhavan_sales.php Mehdi Akhavan Sales's biography on Iran Chamber Society (www. iranchamber.com)]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Forough Farrokhzad]] is important in the literary history of Iran for three reasons. First, she was among the first generation to embrace the new style of poetry, pioneered by Nima Yushij during the 1920s, which demanded that poets experiment with rhyme, imagery, and the individual voice. Second, she was the first modern Iranian woman to graphically articulate private sexual landscapes from a woman's perspective. Finally, she transcended her own literary role and experimented with acting, painting, and documentary film-making.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sitemaker.umich.edu/emes/sourcebook/da.data/82637/FileSource/1957_farrokhzad.pdf Forough Farrokhzad and modern Persian poetry]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Fereydoon Moshiri]] is best known as conciliator of classical Persian poetry with the New Poetry initiated by Nima Yooshij. One of the major contributions of Moshiri's poetry, according to some observers, is the broadening of the social and geographical scope of modern Persian literature.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fereydoonmoshiri.org/fmepage01.htm Fereydoon Moshiri's official website]&lt;/ref&gt;

A poet of the last generation before the Islamic Revolution worthy of mention is [[Mohammad-Reza Shafiei-Kadkani]] (M. Sereshk). Though he is from Khorassan and sways between allegiance to Nima Youshij and Akhavan Saless, in his poetry he shows the influences of Hafiz and Mowlavi. He uses simple, lyrical language and is mostly inspired by the political atmosphere. He is the most successful of those poets who in the past four decades have tried hard to find a synthesis between the two models of Ahmad Shamloo and Nima Youshij.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.art-arena.com/book.htm#Nader_Naderpour Mahmud Kianush, ''"A Summary of the Introduction to Modern Persian Poetry"'']&lt;/ref&gt;

In the twenty-first century, a new generation of Iranian poets continues to work in the New Poetry style and now attracts an international audience thanks to efforts to translate their works. Éditions Bruno Doucey published a selection of forty-eight poems by Garus Abdolmalekian entitled ''Our Fists under the Table'' (2012),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.editions-brunodoucey.com/garous-abdolmalekian/ http://www.editions-brunodoucey.com/garous-abdolmalekian]&lt;/ref&gt; translated into French by Farideh Rava. Other notable names are poet and publisher Babak Abazari (1984–2015), who died under mysterious circumstances in January 2015,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rusartnet.com/biographies/humanitarian/they-must-not-be-forgotten/iran/babak-abazari http://www.rusartnet.com/biographies/humanitarian/they-must-not-be-forgotten/iran/babak-abazari]&lt;/ref&gt; and emerging young poet Milad Khanmirzaei.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rusartnet.com/persian-culture/iranian-writers/milad-khanmirzaei-%D9%85%DB%8C%D9%84%D8%A7%D8%AF-%D8%AE%D8%A7%D9%86%E2%80%8C%D9%85%DB%8C%D8%B1%D8%B2%D8%A7%DB%8C%DB%8C http://www.rusartnet.com/persian-culture/iranian-writers/milad-khanmirzaei-%D9%85%DB%8C%D9%84%D8%A7%D8%AF-%D8%AE%D8%A7%D9%86%E2%80%8C%D9%85%DB%8C%D8%B1%D8%B2%D8%A7%DB%8C%DB%8C]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Philipp Blom''' (born 1970) is a historian, novelist, journalist and translator. He was born in [[Hamburg]], Germany, grew up in [[Detmold]], and studied in [[Vienna]] and [[Oxford]]. He holds a DPhil in Modern History from Oxford University. After living and working in London, Paris and Vienna he now lives in Los Angeles with his wife [[Veronica Buckley]].

His historical works include ''To Have and To Hold'',&lt;ref&gt;''To Have and to Hold - An Intimate History of Collectors and Collecting'', Allen Lane/Penguin, London, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; a history of collectors and collecting, and ''Encyclopédie''&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopédie - The Triumph of Reason in an Unreasonable Age'', Fourth Estate, London, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; (US edition: ''Enlightening the World''), a history of the ''[[Encyclopaedia]]'' by Diderot and d'Alembert that sparked the Enlightenment in France. In ''The Vertigo Years'', Blom argues that the break with the past that is often associated with the trauma of World War I actually had its roots in the years before the war from 1900-1914.&lt;ref&gt;''The Vertigo Years - Change and Culture in the West'', Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson, London, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Blom followed this with ''Fracture: Life and Culture in the West, 1918-1938'', a cultural history of the interwar years.

Blom has published two novels: ''The Simmons Papers''&lt;ref&gt;''The Simmons Papers'', Faber &amp; Faber, London, 1995; German edition ''Die Simmons Papiere'', Berlin Verlag, Berlin, 1997&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Luxor'' (in German).&lt;ref&gt;''Luxor'', Tisch 7, Cologne, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

He has also published a guide to Austrian wines, ''The Wines of Austria'',&lt;ref&gt;''The Wines of Austria'', Faber &amp; Faber, London, 2000; reissued by Mitchell Beazley, London, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; and an English translation of Geert Mak's ''Amsterdam'' (1999) (Blom has a Dutch mother and speaks the language as well).

As a journalist, Blom has written for the ''Times Literary Supplement'', ''The Financial Times'', ''The Independent'', ''The Guardian'', and the ''Sunday Telegraph'' in Britain, for various German-language publications (''Neue Zürcher Zeitung'', ''Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung'', ''Die Zeit'', ''Süddeutsche Zeitung'', ''Financial Times Deutschland'', ''Berliner Zeitung'', ''Der Standard'', ''Die Tageszeitung''), and for ''Vrij Nederland'' in the Netherlands, as well as for other magazines and journals, the BBC, and German radio stations.  He currently hosts a live cultural programme, "Von Tag zu Tag", on station Ö1 on Austrian National Radio.

Recently,{{when|date=December 2014}} Blom has written the libretto for an opera, ''Soliman'', a project with the composer Joost van Kerkhooven, and has provided translations for stage productions (''The Producers'' for the Établissement Ronacher, and ''[[La Colombe (opera)|La Colombe]]'' for the Schönbrunn Theatre, Vienna).

'''Pontypool japan''' is a name given to the process of [[japanning]] with the use of an oil [[varnish]] and heat which is credited to [[Thomas Allgood]] of [[Pontypool]]. In the late 17th century, during his search for a [[corrosion]]-resistant coating for [[iron]], he developed a recipe that included [[asphaltum]], [[linseed oil]] and [[burnt umber]]. Once applied to metal and heated the coating turned black and was extremely tough and durable.

[[Pontypool]] is in a steep valley in [[South Wales]], surrounded by [[coal]] and iron working. The iron used was produced by the furnaces of [[Blaenavon]] to the North, and most of the "[[Pontypool ware]]" was actually produced in nearby [[Usk]] or [[Newport, Wales|Newport]], at the Southern end of the valley.

==Background==
In the late 17th century, there was a developing trade in metal goods made of thin iron sheet, spurred by development of the [[rolling mill]]. [[Rustproofing]] this iron was important. [[Tin plating]] had been developed in [[Germany]], and British manufacturers needed to compete.

While it was the growth of the iron foundries and tin plating that gave birth to [[japanning]] on metal, tin plated iron was not the only metal used. There are examples of [[brass]], [[copper]] and [[bronze]] used as substrates. In [[France]] copper was the metal primarily used. Because it had to be hammered into shape rather than rolled and stamped the surface was uneven.&lt;ref&gt;
{{Cite book |last=Huth |title=Lacquer of the West | publisher=University of Chicago Press |year=1971}}
&lt;/ref&gt; This did not provide the best surface for japanning thus it has a greater tendency to flake off than the smoother English tinware. When the French made tinware it was often trimmed with bronze.

The use of metal allowed a variety of forms that were required to withstand heat and water. Coffee pots, tea sets, candle sticks and other household items could all be japanned and decorated in the popular fashion.

These japanned metal objects are very stable so a great many still survive. Many pieces survive today with little rust. In most cases it is easy to ascertain the underlying metal because it can be seen in losses or scratches. If the japanning is intact, a [[magnet]] can be used to identify iron. Most iron trays show some rust on the back where only a single coating was applied. Even the tin plated iron objects show rust in some areas.

It is worth remembering the unavailability of effective paint, at this time. The surface finishes that did exist either had poor adhesion to their substrate, or required either a [[porous]] or an [[organic matter|organic]] substrate to bond to. Today's resin-based paints for metals had not been invented.

==Recipes==
Similar recipes or "secret varnishes" were also used in [[Birmingham]]. In his book on Pontypool japan (W. D. John, 1953),&lt;ref name="John, 1953" &gt;{{Cite book 
  |title=Pontypool and Usk Japanned Wares |author=W. D. John 
  |publisher=The Ceramic Book Company 
  |location=Newport, UK 
  |year=1953
}}&lt;/ref&gt; published one of the recipes the workmen had handed down through generations:
* 448 pounds of raw [[linseed oil]]
* 22 pounds of lump [[umber]]
* 20 pounds of flake [[litharge]]
* 100 pounds of [[asphaltum]]
* 5 pounds of [[cobalt]] resinate
* 406 pounds of [[white spirit]] or [[turpentine]]

The linseed oil was heated together with the umber and the asphaltum while the litharge and cobalt were added slowly. According to the recipe, the varnish was ready when a drop of varnish dripped onto cold glass remained in a ball. After cooling, the turpentine was added. There was also a pale clear version which omitted the asphaltum and the cobalt.&lt;ref name="John, 1953" /&gt; In modern tests, this varnish worked equally well on [[papier mâché]] and metal plates. Three coats produced a durable glossy black finish.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

  |publisher=Butterworth Heinemann 
  |year=2000 |isbn=0-7506-4412-5 
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This recipe is similar to one for [[Sizing#Gilding|gold size]] published by both (Robert Dossie, 1764) &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book 
  |title=The Handmaid to the Arts |author=Robert Dossie

  |title=A Treatise on Japanning and Varnishing |author=John Stalker and George Parker 
  |origyear=1688 
  |year=1971 |publisher=Alec Tiranti |location=London 
}}&lt;/ref&gt; In that version, linseed oil is boiled together with [[gum animi]], asphaltum, [[litharge]] and umber in approximately the same proportions as the Pontypool recipe. (Watin, 1755) &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book 
  |title=L'Art du peintre, doreur. vernisseur |author=J. Watin 
  |origyear=1755 |publisher=Leonce Laget |location=Paris

}}&lt;/ref&gt; also describes the use of asphaltum as an addition to the well-known spirit varnishes of the day. It appears that the secret recipe for Pontypool japan had been in existence for some time before its use for japanning metal.

[[File:The grave of Bishop Robert Keith, Canongate Kirkyard, Edinburgh.jpg|thumb|The grave of Bishop Robert Keith, Canongate Kirkyard, Edinburgh]]
Bishop '''Robert Keith''' (1681–1757) was a [[Scottish Episcopal Church|Scottish Episcopal]] [[bishop]] and [[historian]].

==Life==
Born at Uras in [[Kincardineshire]], [[Scotland]], on 7 February 1681, he was the second son of Alexander Keith and Marjory Keith (née Arbuthnot). He was educated at [[Marischal College]], [[Aberdeen]] between 1695 and 1699; graduating with an [[Master of Arts|A.M.]] in about 1700.

He was [[preceptor]] to [[George Keith, 10th Earl Marischal|George, Lord Keith]] (afterward the last [[Earl Marischal]]) from July 1703 to July 1710, and to his brother, [[James Francis Edward Keith|James Keith]]. He was [[Holy Orders|ordained]] a [[Anglican ministry#Deacons|deacon]] on 16 August 1710, and from November 1710 to February 1713, he was [[Domestic Chaplain]] to [[Charles Hay, 13th Earl of Erroll|Charles Hay]], 13th [[Earl of Erroll]] and his mother Anne, the [[Dowager]] Countess. Three years later, he was ordained to the [[Anglican ministry#Priests|priesthood]] on 26 May 1713. On the same day, he was appointed [[curate]] at Barrenger's Close meeting-house in [[Edinburgh]], and in 1733 he became [[Incumbent]] of the meeting-house; a post he kept until his death.

In 1716, he and other clergy in Edinburgh were prosecuted by the [[Commission of Justiciary|Commission of the Justiciary]] for not praying for [[George I of Great Britain|King George I]]. He was prohibited from the ministry and fined.

In 1719, he married Isobel Cameron, daughter of the Reverend John Cameron, Incumbent of Kincardine-in-Menteith. They had two children: an unnamed daughter (died before 1757), and Catharine who married Stewart Carmichael, an Edinburgh merchant, in 1752.

In March 1720, he was one of the clergy of Edinburgh who met to elect Arthur Ross's successor.

In 1727, he was appointed [[coadjutor bishop|coadjutor]] to the [[Bishop of Edinburgh]], and [[Consecration|consecrated]] to the [[Episcopal polity|Episcopate]] at [[Edinburgh]] on 18 June 1727. His [[consecrator]]s were bishops [[Arthur Millar]] and [[Thomas Rattray]].

Four years later, he was appointed [[Bishop of Caithness]], [[Bishop of Orkney|Orkney]] and [[Bishop of the Isles|The Isles]] in December 1731. Between 1733 and 1743, he was also [[Bishop of Fife]]. He was elected [[Primus of the Scottish Episcopal Church]] on 20 August 1743.

He was deeply versed in [[archeology]], [[numismatics]] and Scottish [[antiquities]]. His published works include ''History of the Affairs of Church and State in Scotland'' and ''An Historical Catalogue of the Bishops of Scotland''.

He died in [[Leith]] on 20 January 1757, aged 75, and is buried in [[Canongate Churchyard]] on the [[Royal Mile]] in Edinburgh. The grave lies slightly west of the church.

'''Save Venice Inc. (SV)''' is a U.S. non-profit organization dedicated to the conservation of art and architecture and the preservation of cultural heritage sites in Venice, Italy. Headquartered in New York City, it has an office in Venice, an active chapter in Boston, and supporters across the United States and Europe.

Save Venice Inc. organizes special events, including annual masquerade balls, educational trips and lectures, and biennial galas in Venice, to raise funds and awareness for the preservation of Venetian art and architecture. Since its founding in December 1971, SV has restored more than 450 works of art and architecture in Venice. 

== History ==

Save Venice Inc. was established in the wake of the catastrophic flooding in Italy in November 1966, which particularly damaged Florence [[1966 flood of the Arno|Florence]] and also Venice [[1966 Venice flood|Venice]]. The immediate response was the Committee to Rescue Italian Art (CRIA), which brought together donors, art historians, art conservators, and others to conserve damaged and imperiled works of art, architecture, books and manuscripts. Although CRIA’s work was accomplished quickly, closing its New York office in 1971 and its Florentine office in 1973, the organization’s success had drawn the world’s attention to the fragility of Italian artistic treasures and encouraged many others to take up the cause.  
 
Recognizing the devastation in Venice, Col. James A. Gray of the International Fund for Monuments (IFM) (now the [[World Monuments Fund]]) enlisted Professor John McAndrew of Wellesley College to coordinate administrative and academic assistance. In February 1969, the Venice Committee of the IFM began writing letters, organizing events, and raising money for Venice. By April, they had raised almost half a million dollars in cash, pledges, and donated art, and had founded chapters in Boston and California.

In December 1971, the organization changed its name and separated from the IFM to focus uniquely on the city of Venice. The founding members of SV were John McAndrew (1904-1978), Professor of Art History at Wellesley College; his wife, Betty Bartlett McAndrew (1906-1986); [[Sydney Joseph Freedberg|Sydney J. Freedberg]] (1914-1997), Chairman of the Department of Fine Art at Harvard University and later Chief Curator Emeritus of the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C.; his wife Kathleen Wick; Eleanor Garvey (1918-2013), curator at Harvard’s [[Houghton Library]]; and lawyer Stuart Johnson. 

Beginning as a volunteer organization, Save Venice relied heavily upon the personal friendships of the McAndrews, as well as the historic connections between Venice and Boston. All mailings were hand-addressed by volunteers, gathered around a members’ dining table at home; fundraising efforts included sales of art, particularly paintings and works on paper, many taken from the walls of the McAndrews’ or their friends’ houses.

Restoration projects ranged in scope and expense. Early conservation treatments could be as small as the repair of a damaged 15th-century map or as monumental as the restoration of Tintoretto’s huge [[Il Paradiso|''Paradise'']] in the Sala del Maggior Consiglio in the Palazzo Ducale (a canvas measuring 74 feet wide). Some altarpieces in churches and pictures in palaces had never been cleaned and were barely visible beneath layers of yellowed varnish, candle grease, and smoke. A related goal was to retain as much as possible of the original context of a work of art by keeping it in the place for which it was made, rather than transferring works to museums for safekeeping. Another major concern was to establish scientific laboratories for cleaning, restoration, and the instruction of these methods to new generations of conservators. As part of this, bursaries and scholarships were established for workmen, restorers, and scholars alike.

McAndrew, an architectural historian with a deep love for Venice, was the guiding spirit of Save Venice until his death in 1978. He was succeeded by  Rollin van Nostrand (Bump) Hadley, the Director of the [[Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum]] in Boston. By the late 1980s, the heart of the organization had moved from Boston to New York, and a professional staff was hired. Laurence Lovett was elected President of Save Venice in 1986. Realizing that the needs of Venice far-eclipsed available money, he hired Beatrice Guthrie, who had been enormously successful in raising funds for the Metropolitan Opera in New York. Soon her husband, Dr. Randolph Guthrie, a prominent plastic surgeon, joined the Board as Treasurer and eventually succeeded Lovett as President. Together, the Guthries rapidly transformed Save Venice, increasing its annual fund-raising more than one hundred times. The increased ambition of Save Venice Inc. was most evident in its 1987 decision to restore the entire church of [[Santa Maria dei Miracoli, Venice|Santa Maria dei Miracoli]] necessitating a dramatic upturn in funds required. This led to the development of the first multiday galas in Venice, a long-weekend format with educational components, social events, and a black-tie benefit dinner that continues to take place every two years and that has been taken up by many other organizations. Through these galas in Venice, benefit dinners in New York and elsewhere, trips and cruises, corporate sponsors, commercial endorsements, bequests, and a membership program, Save Venice has raised in some years as much for Venice as the two dozen other private committees devoted to Venice combined.

== Major restorations ==

Restoration projects are selected once a year, after Board members gather in Venice to visit potential projects suggested by numerous parties — government agencies, museums, churches, academics, and friends. Decisions are made with guidance from the Project Committee, composed of a dozen art experts in the United States. Restorations are executed by trained conservators under the supervision of specialists in the Italian Superintendencies of Fine Arts and Monuments.

Save Venice has an average of thirty restorations in progress at any given time, including buildings, paintings, statuary, books, and archives. Scholarship is supported through fellowships, exhibitions, conferences, and summer internships. Other educational efforts include numerous publications and an annual lecture series in Venice, New York, Boston, and Los Angeles.

Among the largest projects have been:
* [[San Sebastiano, Venice|San Sebastiano]], including the decorative cycle by [[Paolo Veronese]]
* [[Scuola Grande di San Marco|Scuola Grande di San Marco facade]]
* [[Santa Maria dei Miracoli, Venice|Santa Maria dei Miracoli]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Save Venice Inc. funds the restoration of Titian's 'Assumption of the Virgin'|url=http://artdaily.com/news/104412/Save-Venice-Inc--funds-the-restoration-of-Titian-s--Assumption-of-the-Virgin--#.Wv2Zv9Mvzu5|website=Art Daily|publisher=Jose Villarreal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Rosand Library &amp; Study Center ==

The Rosand Library and Study Center (RLSC) was established in 2014 when [[David Rosand]] (1938-2014), professor of art history at Columbia University and Save Venice board member, bequeathed his library of some 4500 volumes to Save Venice. The collection includes a variety of rare books, along with offprints, dissertations, and journals. While the focus of the library is the art and history of Venice, with particular depth in the Venetian Renaissance, the collection ranges from Chinese calligraphy to Abstract Expressionism. Additionally, the library is supplemented by Save Venice’s restoration files, which document its more than four decades of conservation projects, as well as the photographic archives of restorations. The library is open to readers by appointment. 

The establishment and organization of the library was headed by Mary E. Frank, then chair of the Save Venice Education Resources Committee, who oversaw the cataloguing of the books in New York and their move to Save Venice’s Venetian office in Palazzo Contarini Polignac.

On June 18, 2015, both local and international supporters joined Save Venice to commemorate the official inauguration of the RLSC. 

== Lecture series ==

=== Venice ===

The Rosand Library &amp; Study Center holds monthly roundtable discussions, usually in Italian, that focus on the latest conservation projects of Save Venice and feature presentations and dialogue between art restorers and art historians. 

=== New York ===

The New York Education &amp; Enrichment Series organizes lectures throughout the year on Venetian art, history, and culture presented by art historians, conservators, curators, and artists. Lectures are often held at NYU’s [[Casa Italiana Zerilli-Marimò]] and the Italian Cultural Institute. 

=== Boston ===

Typically held at the historic [[Chilton Club]] in Back Bay, the Boston Chapter maintains a series of three lectures, organized in the winter/spring, on topics related to Venetian history, art, architecture, or music, as well as an Annual General Meeting in the early autumn. 

== Events ==

=== Venice ''Gran Gala a Venezia'' ===

Held every other year in Venice, the four-day gala often takes as its theme an event associated with Venice, such as [[Carnival of Venice|Carnival]] in February, or the [[Venice Biennale|Biennale]] in June, or Regatta Week in late August. The gala gives its guests an opportunity to experience the city of Venice at a special seasonal moment and also to see Save Venice’s restoration work first-hand.

=== New York ''Ballo in Maschera'' ===

The annual masked ball held in New York is a black-tie fundraising dinner that aims to recreate lavishly the spirit of Venice for an evening and promote the art, culture, and traditions of the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Suhrawardi|first1=Rebecca|title=Is Save Venice The New Met Ball?|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/rebeccasuhrawardi/2018/04/23/is-save-venice-the-new-met-ball/#10a71e1112f1|website=Forbes}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ward|first1=Maria|title=Sienna Miller, Lauren Santo Domingo, and More at the Save Venice Masked Ball|url=https://www.vogue.com/article/save-venice-masked-ball-lauren-santo-domingo|website=Vogue}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Boston ===

Past events in Boston include a costume ball and silent auction recreating the 1961 Festival del Cinema on the Lido (2006); a black-tie dinner followed by an Edwardian brunch, both celebrating Italian artistic inspiration, and held inside the historic Ames-Webster Mansion in Back Bay (2010); a “Library at Night” fundraiser at The Boston Public Library (2013); a celebration of [[Tony Duquette]] and [[Elsie de Wolfe]] with a lecture and book signing of “The Walk to Elsie’s” with authors Hutton Wilkinson and M. Flynn Kuhnert (2015); and a masked ball at the [[Algonquin Club]] in Back Bay (2016).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Boston Chapter Events|url=https://savevenice.org/save-venice-events/boston/|website=Save Venice Inc}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Young Friends ===

The mission of the Young Friends of Save Venice is to involve young supporters (up to 39 years old) in the preservation of Venice’s artistic patrimony. The Young Friends group in New York have played a major role in the planning of the annual ball in New York, and have raised more than five million dollars for restorations in Venice. In Boston since the late -1990s, the Young Friends of Save Venice brought in a cohort of much-needed younger members and raised large sums through a series of Carnevale and other themed parties in the winter.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9825">[[The Reverend]] '''Stafford Poole''', [[Congregation of the Mission|C.M.]], (born March 6, 1930)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite linked authority file|id=n85-346373|accessdate=2008-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[Catholic priest]] and a [[historian|research historian]]. He was formerly a [[professor]] of [[history]] at, and later served as President of, the former [[St. John's Seminary (California)|St. John's Seminary College]] (closed 2002) in [[Camarillo, California]]. Additionally, he is known for his extensive writings about the history of the [[Catholic Church]] in Mexico and the devotion to the [[Virgin of Guadalupe]].

==Early life==
Poole was born in [[Oxnard, California]], the son of Beatrice Hessie Smith and Joseph Outhwaite Poole, Sr., and was raised in [[North Hollywood]]. While in grammar schools there, his classmates included both the sons of the noted singer, [[Bing Crosby]], as well as the future [[Cardinal (Catholic)|Cardinal]] [[Roger Mahony]]. For high school, he attended [[Los Angeles College]], which was a [[junior seminary|minor seminary]] run by the [[Archdiocese of Los Angeles]] for high-school age boys who were considering the priesthood.&lt;ref name=Schroeder&gt;Schroeder, Susan. "Seminaires and Writing the History of New Spain: An Interview with Stafford Poole, C.M." ''The Americas''. 69:2 (October 2012), 237-254.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Studies==
Upon his graduation in 1947 he joined the [[Congregation of the Mission]] of [[Saint Vincent de Paul]], taking his [[vows]] in 1949. He did his [[seminary]] studies at the Vincentian seminary in [[Perryville, Missouri]], earning a [[bachelor's degree]] in 1952. He completed his [[theology|theological]] studies and was [[Holy Orders|ordained]] in 1956, afterwards teaching in [[seminaries]] in the [[Midwestern United States]]. He received a [[Master's degree]] in [[Spanish literature]] in 1958 and then in 1961 his [[doctorate]] in history, both from [[St. Louis University]].&lt;ref name=Schroeder/&gt;

Although his focus had been American and European history, Poole's [[dissertation]] was titled "The Indian Problem in the Third Mexican Provincial Council, 1585" in which he analyzed recently found documents from the first [[Plenary council (Catholicism)#Provincial councils|Provincial Councils]] of the Catholic Church in Mexico.&lt;ref name=Schroeder/&gt;

==Authorship==
Poole wrote an article in 1964 for the [[Jesuit]] magazine ''[[America (Jesuit magazine)|America]]'' entitled ''Tomorrow's Seminaries'', in which he reflected on his experiences from teaching seminarians. The article was a sensation in Church circles, and he was soon approached to write a book on the topic. He contracted with the American branch of the German publishing house [[Herder &amp; Herder]], which specialized in works on Catholic topics. They published his book, ''Seminary in Crisis'' in 1965. He was involved as an expert consultant on seminary formation for the [[United States Conference of Bishops]] and other authorities for the next twenty years.

He continued to take an interest in the Council which he had studied for his dissertation, and wrote several articles on it for scholarly journals with [[Hispanic]] focus. As a result, he was led to translate the ''[[Apologia]]'' of the Spanish [[Dominican friar]] and [[bishop]], [[Bartolomé de las Casas]], who was a major defender of [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] rights in the new [[colony|colonies]] of the [[Spanish Empire]]. This was a [[Latin language|Latin]] work of the speeches Las Casas delivered at the [[Valladolid debate]] of 1550-1551. This was published in 1974 by [[Northern Illinois University Press]]; a second edition appeared in 1992 and is still in print.&lt;ref name=Schroeder/&gt;

Poole also researched the life of [[Pedro Moya de Contreras]], the third [[Archbishop of Mexico]], who had convoked and presided at the Third Mexican Council.  This biography was published by the [[University of California Press]] in 1987.  A second, revised edition was published by the [[University of Oklahoma Press]] in 2011, and a Spanish translation by the [[Colegio de Michoacán]], Mexico. His research into the archbishop's life caused him to be interested in that of the prelate's mentor, [[Juan de Ovando]]. In 2004 the University of Oklahoma Press published the biography, ''Juan de Ovando: Governing the Spanish Empire in the Reign of Philip II''.

In 1971 Poole was assigned to teach [[Church history]] at St. John's Seminary College, which at that time was administered by his [[Congregation (Catholic)|religious congregation]] for the [[Archdiocese of Los Angeles]]. He was appointed as President of the College in 1980, but resigned in 1984 due to a disagreement with the Archdiocese about structural changes in the school.

==Guadalupan studies==
After his retirement from active teaching in 1990, Poole became the [[archivist]] for the Western [[ecclesiastical province|Province]] of his Congregation.

In addition to that, though, he was able to work on an interest he had long felt on the history of the [[Marian apparitions|apparitions]] of Our Lady of Guadalupe. For this he undertook the study of [[Classical Nahuatl]], and  published several works in that field.

Poole's writings regarding Our Lady of Guadalupe include the books ''Our Lady of Guadalupe: The Origins and Sources of a Mexican National Symbol, 1531-1797'', an English translation of [[Luis Laso de la Vega]]'s [[Nahuatl]] account of the apparition, ''[[Huei tlamahuiçoltica]]'', and a translation and critical edition of two Nahuatl plays about the Virgin. In 2006 he published ''The Guadalupan Controversies in Mexico'', where, along with other experts in the field, he disputed the historicity of [[Juan Diego]], the [[Aztec]] man to whom the Virgin is believed to have appeared. Poole opposed the efforts to have him declared a [[saint]], in which he was ultimately unsuccessful.

'''''The Brome play of Abraham and Isaac''''' (also known as '''''The Brome “Abraham and Isaac”''''', '''''The Brome Abraham''''', and '''''The Sacrifice of Isaac''''') is a [[15th century in literature|fifteenth-century]] play of unknown authorship, written in an [[East Anglian English|East Anglian]] dialect&lt;ref name="Coldewey"/&gt; of [[Middle English]], which dramatises the story of the Akedah, the [[binding of Isaac]].

==The play==

In the opening scene, [[Abraham]] prays to [[God in Christianity|God]], thanking Him for His various blessings, most of all his favourite son, [[Isaac]]. Next, God reveals to an angel that he will test Abraham's faith by asking him to sacrifice Isaac. The angel conveys this instruction to Abraham who, though he is distraught, agrees to comply with it. Abraham takes Isaac to the place of sacrifice, his grief made all the greater by Isaac (not yet knowing he is the "qweke best" intended for sacrifice) being eager to aid his father. When Abraham reveals that he means to kill him, Isaac at first pleads for his life. However, when he learns that it is God's will that he should die, Isaac acquiesces in his death, even urging his father not to tarry over the deed. Abraham binds Isaac so that he will not deflect his father's sword but when he draws that sword and prepares to strike, the angel appears and takes it out of his hand. The angel reveals that God is pleased with Abraham's obedience and that Isaac need not be sacrificed after all. Leaving them with a ram, the angel departs. As they make the offering, God appears above (the medieval custom was to have God act at a higher level than other characters) and promises them that “for thys dede | I schall mvltyplye yowres botheres [both] sede | As thyke as sterres be in the skye”. In an epilogue a [[Doctor of Philosophy|doctor]], a stock figure in medieval drama, appears and points the moral that we should obey God's commandments and not rail against the designs God has for us.

==Scholarship==

The text of the play was lost until the 19th century, when a manuscript was found in a [[commonplace book]] dating from around 1470–80 at [[Brome, Suffolk|Brome]] Manor, [[Suffolk]], England.&lt;ref name="Adams"/&gt; The manuscript itself has been dated at 1454 at the earliest.&lt;ref name="Coldewey"&gt;''Early English Drama: an anthology'' edited by John C. Coldewey, [[Routledge]], 1993, {{ISBN|978-0-8240-5465-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; This manuscript is now housed at [[Yale University]]'s [[Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://docs.google.com/gview?a=v&amp;q=cache:vJX-2T8cjZQJ:www.wwnorton.com/NAEL/noa/pdf/13BromePlay_1_12.pdf+abraham+brome&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=uk&amp;pid=bl&amp;srcid=ADGEESjO-PS6cbq09o7j09hnlFZO_IW-lik0uiDDn10EwLI6VCYOEr2FAFzpimgto5kIQsGVKuSy-W0TQmhnVaTbnPyxVUkD0NCVSrJOc7rgHnDOcrANDodfMApNj6qzHT9Wgt6wgKXg&amp;sig=AFQjCNGunquTWJi_O_lfPIMvf0-uoNE4vQ Google docs]&lt;/ref&gt;

While [[Joseph Quincy Adams]] reckoned the Brome Abraham “must be dated as early as [[14th century in literature|the fourteenth century]],”,&lt;ref name="Adams"&gt;''Chief Pre-Shakespearean Dramas'' edited by [[Joseph Quincy Adams]], [[Houghton Mifflin Company]], 1924&lt;/ref&gt; most other scholars assign various periods of the fifteenth century for the play's composition.

The Brome Abraham's relation to the play of the same subject in the cycle of [[Chester Mystery Plays]] has attracted attention. A comparison of the texts reveals around 200 lines of striking similarity, in particular during the debates between Abraham and Isaac that are at the hearts of the plays. A. M. Kinghorn judged the Brome play to be a superior reworking of the Chester barbers' play of Abraham, and accordingly dated the play to late in the fifteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;''Mediæval Drama'' by A. M. Kinghorn, [[Evans Brothers (publisher)|Evans Brothers]], London 1968&lt;/ref&gt; However, comparing the two, J. Burke Severs decided that the Chester play was an expansion and reworking of the Brome one.&lt;ref&gt;[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3708/is_199901/ai_n8828474/pg_6/?tag=content;col1 The Sacrifice of Isaac in Medieval English Drama]&lt;/ref&gt;

It is not known whether the play was originally part of a larger cycle of [[mystery plays]], such as at [[Chester Mystery Plays]] and [[York Mystery Plays]], or if it stood by itself, as Osborn Waterhouse of the [[Early English Text Society]] believed, though he conceded that it was to be supposed “that the stage was the usual pageant, and the mode of performance practically identical with that of the regular cycle plays.”&lt;ref name="Adams"/&gt;

The play is often considered the best of Middle English Abraham plays, humane in its treatment of infanticide, inventive in its language;&lt;ref name="Coldewey"/&gt; [[Lucy Toulmin Smith]], a nineteenth-century editor, found it to be superior to others of the period on the same subject and in the twentieth century George K. Anderson thought the play, its "human qualities" and characterisation, "unusually good",&lt;ref&gt;''Old and Middle English Literature From the Beginnings to 1485'' by George K. Anderson, [[OUP]], 1950, p.215&lt;/ref&gt; and Gassner thought it "a masterpiece".&lt;ref name="Gassner"&gt;''Medieval and Tudor Drama'' edited by John Gassner, Applause Theatre Book Publishers, 1963, 1995 reprint {{ISBN|978-0-936839-84-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adams noted that it was often reprinted due to its being "justly regarded as the best example of pathos in the early religious drama".&lt;ref name="Adams"/&gt;

==Productions==

The ''Brome Abraham'' was performed in 1980 by [[Poculi Ludique Societas]] in Toronto.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chass.utoronto.ca/~plspls/pastprod.html Past productions]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:TragicWeekroundup.jpg|thumb|right|Suspects rounded up by the [[Civil Guard (Spain)|Civil Guard]].]]
'''Tragic Week''' (in [[Catalan language|Catalan]] ''la Setmana Tràgica'', in [[Spanish language|Spanish]] ''la Semana Trágica'') (25 July&amp;nbsp;– 2 August 1909) is the name used for a series of violent confrontations between the [[Spanish army]] and members of the working classes of [[Barcelona]] and other cities of [[Catalonia]] ([[Spain]]), assisted by [[anarchist]]s, socialists and [[Republicanism in Spain|republican]]s, during the last week of July 1909.

It was caused by the calling-up of reserve troops by Premier [[Antonio Maura]] to be sent as reinforcements when Spain renewed military-colonial activity in [[Morocco]] on 9 July, in what is known as the [[Second Rif War]]. Many of these reservists were the only breadwinners for their families, while the wealthy were able to hire substitutes.

==Background==
Minister of War [[Arsenio Linares y Pombo]] called up the Third Mixed Brigade of ''Cazadores'' (Light Infantry), which was composed of both active and reserve units in Catalonia. Among these were 520 men who had completed active duty six years earlier, and who had not anticipated further service. Many of the Cazadores, plus other reservists, were the only breadwinners for their families. One could hire a substitute if unable or unwilling to fight, but this cost 6,000 ''[[Spanish real|reales]]'' which was beyond the means of most laborers, who did not earn more than 20 ''reales'' or 5 [[Spanish peseta|peseta]]s a day, barely enough to sustain themselves and their families. Accordingly the well-off were better placed to legally [[Draft evasion|avoid further service]] than members of the [[working class]]es. Finally, conscripted service in North Africa for the perceived benefit only of wealthy mining interests was deeply unpopular.   

The incident began when "a party of conscripts boarded ships owned by the [[Claudio López Bru|marquess of Comillas]], a noted Catholic industrialist, en route for Morocco. The soldiers were accompanied by patriotic addresses, the [[Marcha Real|Royal March]], and religious medals distributed by pious well dressed ladies. Spain's narrow social construction was thus on display for all to see, an affluent Catholic oligarchy impervious to the rise of secular mass politics. As the crowd jeered and whistled, emblems of the [[Sacred Heart]] were thrown into the sea." &lt;ref&gt;Mary Vincent, Spain 1833 - 2002 p.103&lt;/ref&gt; The rebellion had started.

==General strike==
These actions, coupled with anarchist, anti-[[militarist]], and [[anti-colonial]] philosophies shared by many in the city (Barcelona later became a [[Anarchist Catalonia|stronghold for the anarchists]] during the [[Spanish Civil War]]), resulted in the union ''[[Solidaridad Obrera (historical union)|Solidaridad Obrera]]'' - directed by a committee of anarchists and socialists - calling a [[general strike]] against Maura's call-up of the reservists on Monday 26 July 1909. Although the civil governor [[Ángel Ossorio y Gallardo]] had received ample warning of the growing discontent, acts of vandalism were provoked by elements called the ''jóvenes bárbaros'' (Young Barbarians), who were associated with the [[Radical Republican Party]] (Partido Republicano Radical) of [[Alejandro Lerroux]].

==Outbreak==
By Tuesday workers had occupied much of central Barcelona, halting troop trains and overturning [[tram]]s. By Thursday, there was street fighting, with a general eruption of riots, strikes, and the burnings of [[monastery|convents]].

Many of the rioters were antimilitarist, anticolonial and [[anticlerical]]. The rioters considered the Roman Catholic Church to form part of the corrupt [[bourgeois]] class whose sons did not have to go to war, and much public opinion had been turned against the Church by anarchist elements within the city. Thus not only were [[convent]]s burned, but [[sepulcher]]s were profaned and graves were emptied.&lt;ref&gt;Dolors Marín, "Barcelona en llamas: La Semana Trágica", ''La Aventura de la Historia'', Año 11, no. 129, p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt; Of 112 buildings set fire to during the disturbances, 80 were church-owned or associated.

After disturbances in downtown Barcelona, [[Civil Guard (Spain)|civil guards]] and police fired on demonstrators in [[Las Ramblas]], resulting in the construction of barricades in the streets and the proclamation of martial law. The government, declaring a state of war, ordered troops to end the revolt. Working class conscripts recruited from Barcelona and already stationed in the city, were considered unreliable under the circumstances. Accordingly, other army units were brought in from [[Valencia (city in Spain)|Valencia]], [[Zaragoza]], [[Pamplona]] and [[Burgos]]. These finally ended the revolt, causing dozens of deaths.

==Aftermath==
[[Image:Francisco Ferrer Guardia.jpg|right|thumb|150px|[[Francesc Ferrer i Guàrdia]]]]
Police and army casualties were eight dead and 124 wounded.
Of the civilians, 104–150 were reportedly killed. More than 1,700 individuals were indicted in military courts for "armed rebellion". Five were sentenced to death and executed (including [[Francesc Ferrer i Guàrdia|Francesc Ferrer]], founder of the [[Escuela Moderna]]); 59 received sentences of life imprisonment. [[Alejandro Lerroux]] fled into exile.

General European condemnation in the press was immediate. [[Alfonso XIII of Spain|King Alfonso XIII]], alarmed by the reaction at home and abroad, dismissed Premier [[Antonio Maura]] from power afterward, replacing him with [[Segismundo Moret]].

'''Ulla Ehrensvärd''' (18 March 1927 — 17 April 2015) was a Swedish librarian, curator, and art historian, specializing in medals, architectural drawings, and maps.

==Early life==
Eva Maria Ulla Margareta Ehrensvärd was born in Stockholm. She graduated from the Stockholm University of Applied Sciences in 1953. She earned a doctoral degree at [[Stockholm University]] while working in her field, defending her dissertation on medal engraver [[Erik Lindberg]] in 1974, at age 47.&lt;ref&gt;Ulla Ehrensvärd, [https://books.google.com/books/about/Medaljgrav%C3%B6ren_Erik_Lindberg_1873_1966.html?id=MDEXcMvm7goC ''Medaljgravören Erik Lindberg 1873-1966''] (Svenska Numismatiska Föreningen 1974).&lt;/ref&gt; Her postdoctoral studies included a course in cartography at the Royal Institute of Technology in the 1970s.&lt;ref name="IMObit"&gt;Göran Bäärnhielm, "Ulla Ehrensvärd, 1927-2015" ''Imago Mundi'' 68(1)(2016): 92-96. {{doi|10.1080/03085694.2016.1107385}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
During [[World War II]], Ulla Ehrensvärd was a young volunteer aircraft spotter. She began her career as a librarian in 1946, at the [[Stockholm Public Library]]. She was hired to catalog books at the [[Royal Library of Sweden]] in 1953. She became an expert on Russian archives. In 1962 she traveled to the United States on a scholarship, to study museum libraries. She became head of the Maps and Prints Department of the [[National Library of Sweden]] in 1963,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kb.se/english/about/news/In-Memory-of-Ulla-Ehrensvard/ "In Memory of Ulla Ehrensvärd 1927-2015"] National Library of Sweden (25 April 2015).&lt;/ref&gt; and she stayed there until 1981. From 1981 to 1993, she worked at the Military Archives.&lt;ref name="IMObit" /&gt;

Ehrensvärd had a long association with the Swedish Research Institute in [[Istanbul]] from 1976 to 1988, organizing their library, publishing their newsletter, arranging exhibits, and doing research in their collections.&lt;ref&gt;
Fredrik Vahlquist, [http://www.srii.org/page/minnesord-over-professor-ulla-ehrensvard "Minnesord över Ulla Ehrensvärd"] ''Swedish Research Institute in Istanbul''.&lt;/ref&gt; During the same time period, she was head of the Svensk Bokkonst (Swedish Book Design) show and competition. She was the Swedish representative on the International Cartographical Association, and helped to organized cartography conferences in Uppsala and Stockholm in 1988 and 1991. She gave a lecture at the [[Newberry Library]] in 1981, on color in cartography. She was also head of the history of cartography section of the Swedish Cartographic Society, from 1968 to 2001. She was the counted as one of the "Three Great Ladies of Cartography," along with [[Eila Campbell]] and [[Helen Wallis]].&lt;ref name="IMObit" /&gt;

Ehrensvärd organized exhibitions on French drawings (1953), Erik Lindberg (1959), atlases (1966), globes (1966), [[A. E. Nordenskiöld]] (1968), color printing (1972), [[Edgar Chahine]] (1975),&lt;ref&gt;Ulla Ehrensvärd, ''Edgar Chahine (1874-1947): Illustrator and engraver'' (exhibition at the Royal Library, Stockholm, September 1975). {{ISBN|9789170000508}}&lt;/ref&gt; Turkish-Swedish contacts (1977), [[gnomes]] and Santa Claus figures (1978), sea charts and maps of Estonia (1980s). Publications by Ehrensvärd were equally diverse, including a book on gnomes,&lt;ref&gt;Ulla Ehresnvärd, ''Den svenska tomten'' (Svenska turistföreningen 1979). {{ISBN|9789171560056}}&lt;/ref&gt; an inventory of Polish maps in Swedish archives, histories of Swedish maritime mapping and the maritime history of the Baltic region,&lt;ref&gt;Ulla Ehrensvärd, [https://books.google.com/books/about/Mare_Balticum.html?id=jvO5SAAACAAJ ''Mare Balticum''] (Otava Publishing 1995). {{ISBN|9789511139942}}&lt;/ref&gt; and an edition of an eighteenth-century travelogue.&lt;ref name="IMObit" /&gt;

In 2004, Ehrensvärd accepted an award from the Royal Swedish Academy of Letters, History, and Antiquities, to travel for her research.&lt;ref name="IMObit" /&gt; Her book ''The History of the Nordic Map: From Myths to Reality'' was published in 2006,&lt;ref&gt;Ulla Ehrensvärd, [https://books.google.com/books/about/The_history_of_the_Nordic_map.html?id=oosYAQAAMAAJ ''The History of the Nordic Map: From Myths to Reality''] (John Nurminen Foundation 2006). {{ISBN|9789529745203}}&lt;/ref&gt; and considered a "born classic" in the history of cartography.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Ries, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/40234131 Review of ''The History of the Nordic Map: From Myths to Reality'' by Ulla Ehrensvärd], in ''Imago Mundi'' 60(1)(2008): 113.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Unilineal evolution''', also referred to as '''classical social evolution''', is a 19th-century [[social theory]] about the [[evolution of societies]] and [[culture]]s. It was composed of many competing theories by various [[anthropologists]] and [[sociologists]], who believed that [[Western culture]] is the contemporary pinnacle of social evolution. Different social status is aligned in a single line that moves from most primitive to most civilized. This theory is now generally considered [[obsolete]] in [[academic]] circles.

==Intellectual thought==
{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2007}}
Theories of social and [[cultural evolution]] are common in modern [[European thought]]. Prior to the 18th century, Europeans predominantly believed that societies on Earth were in a state of decline. European society held up the world of [[Classical antiquity|antiquity]] as a standard to aspire to, and [[ancient Greece]] and [[ancient Rome]] produced levels of technical accomplishment which Europeans of the [[Middle Ages]] sought to emulate. At the same time, [[Christianity]] taught that people lived in a debased world fundamentally inferior to the [[Garden of Eden]] and [[Heaven]]. During the [[Age of Enlightenment]], however, European self-confidence grew and the notion of progress became increasingly popular. It was during this period that what would later become known as 'sociological and cultural evolution' would have its roots.

The Enlightenment thinkers often speculated that societies progressed through stages of increasing development and looked for the [[logic]], order and the set of scientific truths that determined the course of [[human history]]. [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]], for example, argued that social development was an inevitable and determined process, similar to an [[acorn]] which has no choice but to become an oak tree. Likewise, it was assumed that societies start out primitive, perhaps in a [[Thomas Hobbes|Hobbesian]] [[state of nature]], and naturally progress toward something resembling [[Industrial society|industrial]] Europe.

==Scottish thinkers==
{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2007}}
While earlier authors such as [[Michel de Montaigne]] discussed how societies change through time, it was truly the [[Scottish Enlightenment]] which proved key in the development of cultural evolution. After [[Scotland]]'s [[Act of Union 1707|union]] with [[England]] in 1707, several Scottish thinkers pondered on the relationship between progress and the 'decadence' brought about by increased trade with England and the affluence it produced. The result was a series of '[[conjectural history|conjectural histories]]'. Authors such as [[Adam Ferguson]], [[John Millar (philosopher)|John Millar]], and [[Adam Smith]] argued that all societies pass through a series of four stages: hunting and gathering, pastoralism and nomadism, agricultural, and finally a stage of [[commerce]]. These thinkers thus understood the changes Scotland was undergoing as a transition from an agricultural to a [[mercantile]] society.

Philosophical concepts of progress (such as those expounded by the German philosopher [[G.W.F. Hegel]]) developed as well during this period. In [[France]] authors such as [[Claude Adrien Helvétius]] and other [[philosophers]] were influenced by this Scottish tradition. Later thinkers such as [[Claude Henri de Rouvroy, Comte de Saint-Simon|Comte de Saint-Simon]] developed these ideas. [[Auguste Comte]] in particular presented a coherent view of social progress and a new discipline to study it—[[sociology]].

==Rising interests==
{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2007}}
These developments took place in a wider context. The first process was [[colonialism]]. Although [[Imperial power|Imperial powers]] settled most differences of opinion with their colonial subjects with force, increased awareness of non-Western peoples raised new questions for European scholars about the nature of society and culture. Similarly, effective [[Public administration|administration]] required some degree of understanding of other cultures. Emerging theories of [[social evolution]] allowed Europeans to organize their new knowledge in a way that reflected and justified their increasing political and economic domination of others: colonized people were less-evolved, colonizing people were more evolved. The second process was the [[Industrial Revolution]] and the rise of [[capitalism]] which allowed and promoted continual revolutions in the [[means of production]]. Emerging theories of social evolution reflected a belief that the changes in Europe wrought by the Industrial Revolution and capitalism were obvious improvements. Industrialization, combined with the intense political change brought about by the [[French Revolution]] and [[US Constitution]] which were paving the way for the [[history of democracy|dominance of democracy]], forced European thinkers to reconsider some of their assumptions about how society was organized.

Eventually, in the 19th century, three great classical theories of social and historical change were created: the social [[evolutionism]] theory, the [[social cycle]] theory and the [[Marxist]] [[historical materialism]] theory. Those theories had one common factor: they all agreed that the history of humanity is pursuing a certain fixed path, most likely that of the [[social progress]]. Thus, each past event is not only chronologically, but causally tied to the present and future events. Those theories postulated that by recreating the sequence of those events, sociology could discover the [[laws of history]].

==Birth and development==
{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2007}}
&lt;!-- {{main|Classical social evolutionism}} --&gt;
While social evolutionists agree that the evolution-like process leads to social progress, classical social evolutionists have developed many different theories, known as theories of unilineal evolution. Social evolutionism was the prevailing theory of early socio-cultural anthropology and [[social commentary]], and is associated with scholars like Auguste Comte, [[Edward Burnett Tylor]], [[Lewis Henry Morgan]], and [[Herbert Spencer]]. Social evolutionism represented an attempt to formalize social thinking along scientific lines, later influenced by the biological theory of [[evolution]]. If organisms could develop over time according to discernible, deterministic laws, then it seemed reasonable that societies could as well. This really marks the beginning of Anthropology as a scientific discipline and a departure from traditional religious views of "primitive" cultures.

The term "classical social evolutionism" is most closely associated with the 19th-century writings of Auguste Comte, Herbert Spencer (who coined the phrase "[[survival of the fittest]]") and [[William Graham Sumner]]. In many ways Spencer's theory of '[[cosmic evolution]]' has much more in common with the works of [[Jean-Baptiste Lamarck]] and Auguste Comte than with contemporary works of [[Charles Darwin]]. Spencer also developed and published his theories several years earlier than Darwin. In regard to social institutions, however, there is a good case that Spencer's writings might be classified as 'Social Evolutionism'. Although he wrote that societies over time progressed, and that progress was accomplished through competition, he stressed that the [[individual]] (rather than the [[collectivity]]) is the unit of analysis that evolves, that evolution takes place through natural selection and that it affects social as well as biological phenomenon.

===Progressivism===
Both Spencer and Comte view the society as a kind of organism subject to the process of growth—from simplicity to complexity, from chaos to order, from generalization to specialization, from flexibility to organization. They agreed that the process of societies growth can be divided into certain stages, have their beginning and eventual end, and that this growth is in fact social progress—each newer, more evolved society is better. Thus [[progressivism]] became one of the basic ideas underlying the theory of social evolutionism.

===Auguste Comte===
Auguste Comte, known as father of sociology, formulated the [[law of three stages]]: human development progresses from the [[theology|theological]] stage, in which nature was mythically conceived and man sought the explanation of natural phenomena from supernatural beings, through [[metaphysics|metaphysical stage]] in which nature was conceived of as a result of obscure forces and man sought the explanation of natural phenomena from them until the final [[Positivism#Social Science|positive]] stage in which all abstract and obscure forces are discarded, and natural phenomena are explained by their constant relationship. This progress is forced through the development of human mind, and increasing application of thought, reasoning and logic to the understanding of world.

===Herbert Spencer===
Herbert Spencer believed that society was evolving toward increasing freedom for individuals; and so held that government intervention, ought to be minimal in social and political life, differentiated between two phases of development, focusing is on the type of internal regulation within societies. Thus, he differentiated between [[military]] and [[industry|industrial]] societies. The earlier, more primitive military society has a goal of conquest and [[defense (military)|defence]], is [[centralisation|centralised]], [[economy|economically]] self-sufficient, [[Collectivism|collectivistic]], puts the good of the group over the good of the individual, uses compulsion, force, and repression, rewards loyalty, obedience and discipline. The industrial society has a goal of [[Manufacturing|production]] and [[trade]], is [[decentralisation|decentralised]], interconnected with other societies via economic relations, achieves its goals through voluntary cooperation and individual self-restraint, treats the good of the individual as the highest value, regulates the social life via voluntary relations, and values initiative, independence, and innovation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bolender.com/Dr.%20Ron/SOC4044%20Sociological%20Theory/Class%20Sessions/Sociological%20Theory/Spencer,%20Herbert/spencer,_herbert.htm|title=Ron Bolender|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Regardless of how scholars of Spencer interpret his relation to [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]], Spencer proved to be an incredibly popular figure in the 1870s, particularly in the [[United States]]. Authors such as [[Edward L. Youmans]], [[William Graham Sumner]], [[John Fiske (philosopher)|John Fiske]], [[John Burgess (political scientist)|John W. Burgess]], [[Lester Frank Ward]], [[Lewis H. Morgan]] and other thinkers of the [[gilded age]] all developed theories of social evolutionism as a result of their exposure to Spencer as well as Darwin.

===Lewis H. Morgan===
[[Lewis H. Morgan]], an [[anthropology|anthropologist]] whose ideas have had much impact on sociology, in his 1877 classic ''Ancient Societies'' differentiated between three eras: [[Primitive culture|savagery]], [[barbarian|barbarism]] and [[civilisation]], which are divided by technological inventions, like [[fire]], [[bow (weapon)|bow]], [[pottery]] in savage era, [[domestication of animals]], [[agriculture]], [[metalworking]] in barbarian era and [[alphabet]] and [[writing]] in civilisation era. Thus Morgan introduced a link between the social progress and [[technological progress]]. Morgan viewed the technological progress as a force behind social progress, and any [[social change]]—in [[social institution]]s, organisations or ideologies have their beginning in the change of technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/morgan-lewis/ancient-society/ch03.htm|title=Ancient Society by Lewis H. Morgan 1877|first=Lewis H.|last=Morgan|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Morgan's theories were popularised by [[Friedrich Engels]], who based his famous work ''"[[The Origin of the Family, Private Property and the State]]''" on it. For Engels and other Marxists, this theory was important as it supported their conviction that materialistic factors—economical and technological—are decisive in shaping the fate of humanity.

=== Émile Durkheim ===
[[Émile Durkheim]], another of the 'fathers' of sociology, has developed a similar, [[dichotomy|dichotomical]] view of social progress. His key concept was [[social solidarity]], as he defined the social evolution in terms of progressing from [[mechanical solidarity]] to [[organic solidarity]]. In mechanical solidarity, people are self-sufficient, there is little integration and thus there is the need for use of force and repression to keep society together. In organic solidarity, people are much more integrated and interdependent and specialisation and cooperation is extensive. Progress from mechanical to organic solidarity is based first on [[population growth]] and increasing [[population density]], second on increasing 'morality density' (development of more complex [[social interaction]]s) and thirdly, on the increasing specialisation in workplace. To Durkheim, the most important factor in the social progress is the [[division of labor]].

===Edward Burnett Tylor and Lewis H. Morgan===
Anthropologists [[Edward Burnett Tylor]] in England and Lewis H. Morgan in the United States worked with data from [[indigenous people]], whom they claimed represented earlier stages of cultural evolution that gave insight into the process and progression of cultural evolution. Morgan would later have a significant influence on [[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]], who developed a theory of cultural evolution in which the internal contradictions in society created a series of escalating stages that ended in a socialist society (see [[Marxism]]). Tylor and Morgan elaborated upon, modified and expanded the theory of unilinear evolution, specifying criteria for categorizing cultures according to their standing within a fixed system of growth of humanity as a whole while examining the modes and mechanisms of this growth.

Their analysis of cross-cultural data was based on three assumptions:
# contemporary societies may be classified and ranked as more "primitive" or more "civilized";
# There are a determinate number of stages between "primitive" and "civilized" (e.g. [[Band society|band]], [[tribe]], [[chiefdom]], and [[State (polity)|state]]),
# All societies progress through these stages in the same sequence, but at different rates.
Theorists usually measured progression (that is, the difference between one stage and the next) in terms of increasing social complexity (including class differentiation and a complex division of labor), or an increase in intellectual, theological, and aesthetic sophistication. These 19th-century [[Ethnology|ethnologists]] used these principles primarily to explain differences in religious beliefs and kinship terminologies among various societies.

===Lester Frank Ward===
There were however notable differences between the work of Lester Frank Ward's and Tylor's approaches. [[Lester Frank Ward]] developed Spencer's theory but unlike Spencer, who considered the evolution to be general process applicable to the entire world, physical and sociological, Ward differentiated sociological evolution from biological evolution. He stressed that humans create goals for themselves and strive to realise them, whereas there is no such intelligence and awareness guiding the non-human world, which develops more or less at random. He created a hierarchy of evolution processes. First, there is [[cosmogenesis]], creation and evolution of the world. Then, after life develops, there is [[biogenesis]]. Development of humanity leads to [[wikt:Hominization|anthropogenesis]], which is influenced by the [[human mind]]. Finally, when [[society]] develops, so does [[sociogenesis]], which is the science of shaping the society to fit with various political, cultural and ideological goals.

Edward Burnett Tylor, pioneer of anthropology, focused on the [[evolution of culture]] worldwide, noting that culture is an important part of every society and that it is also subject to the process of evolution. He believed that societies were at different stages of cultural development and that the purpose of anthropology was to reconstruct the evolution of culture, from primitive beginnings to the modern state.

===Ferdinand Tönnies===
[[Ferdinand Tönnies]] describes the evolution as the development from informal society, where people have many liberties and there are few laws and obligations, to modern, formal rational society, dominated by traditions and laws and are restricted from acting as they wish. He also notes that there is a tendency of [[standardization]] and unification, when all smaller societies are absorbed into the single, large, modern society. Thus Tönnies can be said to describe part of the process known today as the [[globalisation]]. Tönnies was also one of the first sociologists to claim that the evolution of society is not necessarily going in the right direction, that the social progress is not perfect, it can even be called a [[wiktionary:regress|regress]] as the newer, more evolved societies are obtained only after paying a high costs, resulting in decreasing satisfaction of individuals making up that society. Tönnies' work became the foundation of [[neo-evolutionism]].

==Critique and impact==
{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2007}}

===Franz Boas===
The early 20th century inaugurated a period of systematic critical examination, and rejection of unilineal theories of cultural evolution. [[Cultural anthropology|Cultural anthropologists]] such as [[Franz Boas]], typically regarded as the leader of anthropology's rejection of classical social evolutionism, used sophisticated [[ethnography]] and more rigorous empirical methods to argue that Spencer, Tylor, and Morgan's theories were speculative and systematically misrepresented ethnographic data. Additionally, they rejected the distinction between "primitive" and "civilized" (or "modern"), pointing out that so-called primitive contemporary societies have just as much history, and were just as evolved, as so-called civilized societies. They therefore argued that any attempt to use this theory to reconstruct the histories of non-literate (i.e. leaving no historical documents) peoples is entirely speculative and unscientific. They observed that the postulated progression,  a stage of civilization identical to that of modern Europe, is [[Ethnocentrism|ethnocentric]]. They also pointed out that the theory assumes that societies are clearly bounded and distinct, when in fact cultural traits and forms often cross social boundaries and diffuse among many different societies (and is thus an important mechanism of change). Boas in his [[culture history]] approach focused on anthropological fieldwork in an attempt to identify factual processes instead of what he criticized as speculative stages of growth.

===Global change===
Later critics observed that this assumption of firmly bounded societies was proposed precisely at the time when European powers were colonizing non-Western societies, and was thus self-serving. Many anthropologists and social theorists now consider unilineal cultural and social evolution a Western [[mythology|myth]] seldom based on solid empirical grounds. Critical theorists argue that notions of social evolution are simply justifications for [[power (sociology)|power]] by the elites of society. Finally, the devastating [[World War]]s that occurred between 1914 and 1945 crippled Europe's self-confidence{{importance-inline}}. After millions of deaths, [[genocide]], and the destruction of Europe's industrial infrastructure, the idea of progress seemed dubious at best.

===Major objections and concerns===
Thus modern socio-cultural evolutionism rejects most of classical social evolutionism due to various theoretical problems:
# The theory was deeply ethnocentric—it makes heavy value judgements on different societies; with [[Western culture|Western civilization]] seen as the most valuable.
# It assumed all cultures follow the same path or progression and have the same goals.
# It equated [[civilization]] with [[material culture]] (technology, cities, etc.)
# It equated evolution with progress or ''fitness'', based on deep misunderstandings of [[evolutionary theory]].
# It is contradicted by evidence. Some (but not all) supposedly primitive societies are arguably more peaceful and equitable/democratic than many modern societies.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

Because social evolution was posited as a scientific theory, it was often used to support unjust and often [[racist]] social practices—particularly colonialism, [[slavery]], and the unequal economic conditions present within industrialized [[Europe]].

'''Xiao Han''' (蕭翰) (d. 949), probably né '''Shulü Han''' (述律翰), also named '''Dilie''' (敵烈), [[courtesy name]] '''Hanzhen''' (寒真), was a general of the [[Khitan people|Khitan]] [[Liao dynasty]].  After a brief Liao conquest of central China after Liao's second emperor [[Emperor Taizong of Liao|Emperor Taizong]] destroyed [[Later Jin (Five Dynasties)|Later Jin]], Xiao was left in control of Later Jin's former capital [[Kaifeng|Daliang]], but was unable to hold it.  He later plotted against Emperor Taizong's nephew and successor [[Emperor Shizong of Liao|Emperor Shizong]] and was executed.

== Background ==
It is not known when Xiao Han was born.  His father was Xiao Dilu (蕭敵魯)&lt;ref name=HL113&gt;''[[History of Liao]]'', [[:zh:s:遼史/卷113|vol. 113]].&lt;/ref&gt; — probably still using the surname of Shulü (述律) at the time — who was a chancellor of [[Liao dynasty|Khitan Empire]] (which would later become Liao) northern court, and who was a brother of [[Empress Shulü Ping]], the wife of Khitan's first emperor [[Emperor Taizu of Liao|Emperor Taizu]] and a son of Emperor Taizu's aunt.&lt;ref name=HL73&gt;''History of Liao'', [[:zh:s:遼史/卷73|vol. 73]].&lt;/ref&gt;  Despite this close relationship, at some point, Xiao Han's mother was put to death by Empress Shulü, causing him to resent the empress from that point on.&lt;ref name=HL113/&gt;

The earliest reference to Xiao Han's military career was in 922, when [[Zhang Wenli]], then in control of Chengde Circuit (成德, headquartered in modern [[Shijiazhuang]], [[Hebei]]), was under the attack by the army of Khitan's southern neighbor [[Jin (Later Tang precursor)|Jin]] and sought Khitan aid.&lt;ref name=HL113/&gt;  While the Chinese accounts were that then Jin-commander [[Li Sizhao]] (adoptive cousin of Jin's prince [[Li Cunxu]]) died in battle with Zhang's army,&lt;ref name=ZZTJ271&gt;''[[Zizhi Tongjian]]'', [[:zh:s:資治通鑑/卷271|vol. 271]].&lt;/ref&gt; Xiao's biography in the ''[[History of Liao]]'' contained a different narrative — that it was Xiao, whom Emperor Taizu sent to aid Zhang, who killed Li Sizhao.&lt;ref name=HL113/&gt;

In any case, after Emperor Taizu's death and succession by Emperor Taizu's son [[Emperor Taizong of Liao|Emperor Taizong]] — who had married Xiao Han's sister [[Empress Xiao Wen|Xiao Wen]] as his empress, and whose sister, according to the Chinese historical source ''[[Zizhi Tongjian]]'', Xiao Han might have married,&lt;ref name=ZZTJ286&gt;''Zizhi Tongjian'', [[:zh:s:資治通鑑/卷286|vol. 286]].&lt;/ref&gt; although it might have been a confusion with Xiao Han's later marriage — Xiao Han became the commander of Emperor Taizong's [[Han Chinese|Han]] guards.  In 945 (by which time Emperor Taizong had changed the name of his Khitan state to Liao, and by which time central China was ruled by [[Later Jin (Five Dynasties)|Later Jin]]), when Emperor Taizong's army was battling that of the Later Jin general [[Du Chongwei|Du Wei]] and initially prevailed, Xiao advocated having the Liao cavalry get off their horses and shooting at Du's army with bows.  Emperor Taizong agreed, but once the Liao cavalry soldiers did so, a Later Jin counterattack caused the battle to go against Liao with heavy losses, much to Emperor Taizong's regret.&lt;ref name=HL113/&gt;

== Brief control of central China ==
By spring 947, Emperor Taizong had entered Later Jin's capital [[Kaifeng|Daliang]] and taken its emperor [[Shi Chonggui]] captive.  He initially declared himself the emperor of China as well, but soon tired of Han rebellions.  He decided to return to Liao proper, and he left Xiao Han in charge of Daliang, as the military governor (''[[Jiedushi]]'') of Xuanwu Circuit (宣武, headquartered at Daliang).&lt;ref name=ZZTJ286/&gt;  Xiao wanted to seize some 50 remaining Later Jin ladies in waiting from Zide Palace (滋德宮), but the eunuch in charge, Zhang Huan (張環), refused.  He forcibly broke down the palace door and seized the ladies in waiting, and then burned Zhang to death by holding heated iron against Zhang's body.&lt;ref name=ZZTJ287&gt;''Zizhi Tongjian'', [[:zh:s:資治通鑑/卷287|vol. 287]].&lt;/ref&gt;

By summer 947, Emperor Taizong had died on the way back to Liao proper, and had been succeeded by his nephew [[Emperor Shizong of Liao|Yelü Ruan]] (as Emperor Shizong).  Xiao himself was facing increasing pressure from Han rebellions, and he considered how he could withdraw from Daliang safely, particularly with one of the main resisters to Liao rule, [[Liu Zhiyuan]] (who had declared himself emperor of a new state later known as [[Later Han (Five Dynasties)|Later Han]], bearing down on him.  He decided to claim that Emperor Taizong had ordered that he turn over central China over to [[Li Congyi]], a prince of Later Jin's predecessor state [[Later Tang]].  He forcibly seized Li and Li's mother [[Consort Dowager Wang]] from Luoyang and had them brought to Daliang, and then declared Li emperor, before withdrawing.  (Li later surrendered to Liu, but was killed.)&lt;ref name=ZZTJ287/&gt;

As Xiao withdrew toward Liao proper, when he reached Heng Prefecture (恆州, Chengde's capital), he and another Liao general, Yelü Mada (耶律麻荅), had soldiers surround the mansion of an ethnically Han chancellor, [[Zhang Li (Liao dynasty)|Zhang Li]], as Yelü Mada and he both bore grudges against Zhang.  He wanted to kill Zhang, but Yelü Mada persuaded him not to, although Zhang soon died in anger.&lt;ref name=ZZTJ287/&gt;  Xiao joined Emperor Shizong on the way back to Liao proper, as Emperor Shizong prepared to confront the army of Empress Dowager Shulü, who wanted Emperor Taizong's younger brother [[Yelü Lihu]] to be emperor.  As the two armies met, Empress Dowager Shulü inquired of Xiao, "What resentment do you have that you rebelled against me?"  He responded to her, "Your subject's mother was sinless, but the Empress Dowager killed her.  I cannot fail to have anger toward you."&lt;ref name=HL113/&gt;  Later, after Empress Dowager Shulü decided to capitulate based on the advice of Yelü Wuzhi (耶律屋質), Emperor Shizong was able to take the throne.&lt;ref name=HL71&gt;''History of Liao'', [[:zh:s:遼史/卷71|vol. 71]].&lt;/ref&gt;  In 948, Xiao married Emperor Shizong's sister Yelü Abuli (耶律阿不里).&lt;ref name=HL113/&gt;

== Death ==
Also in 948, Xiao entered into a conspiracy against Emperor Shizong with Emperor Taizong's son Yelü Tiande (耶律天德), Emperor Taizong's cousin Yelü Liuge (耶律劉哥), and Yelü Liuge's brother Yelü Pendu (耶律盆都).  When their plot was discovered, Yelü Tiande was executed; Yelü Liuge was exiled; and Yelü Pendu was sent as an emissary to [[Kyrgyz people|Xiajiasi]].  Xiao was caned, but after he swore that he was not involved, was released.  In 949, however, he and Yelü Abuli tried to write Emperor Taizu's younger brother Yelü Anduan (耶律安端) to try to persuade Yelü Anduan to join a new conspiracy.  Their letter was intercepted by Yelü Wuzhi, who presented it to Emperor Shizong.  As a result, Xiao was executed, and Yelü Abuli was imprisoned, and she died of illness while imprisoned.&lt;ref name=HL113/&gt;&lt;ref name=HL5&gt;''History of Liao'', [[:zh:s:遼史/卷5|vol. 5]].&lt;/ref&gt;
