'''Alfred Eisenstaedt''' (December 6, 1898 – August 23, 1995) was a [[Germany|German]]-born [[United States|American]] [[photographer]] and [[photojournalist]]. He began his career in pre-[[World War II]] Germany and after moving to the U.S. achieved prominence as a staff photographer for ''[[Life Magazine]]'', which featured more than 90 of his pictures on its covers with over 2,500 photo stories published.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Journalism|last=Hudson|first=Berkley|publisher=SAGE|year=2009|isbn=978-0-7619-2957-4|editor-last=Sterling|editor-first=Christopher H.|location=Thousand Oaks, Calif.|pages=1060–67}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among his most famous cover photographs was ''[[V-J Day in Times Square]]'', taken during the [[V-J Day]] celebration in [[New York City]], showing "an exuberant American sailor kissing a nurse in a dancelike dip [that] summed up the euphoria many Americans felt as the war came to a close."&lt;ref name=obit/&gt; Eisenstaedt was "renowned for his ability to capture memorable images of important people in the news, including statesmen, movie stars and artists" and for his [[candid photography|candid photographs]], taken with a small [[135 film|35mm]] [[Leica Camera|Leica]] camera and typically with only [[Available light|natural lighting]].&lt;ref name=obit/&gt;

==Early life==
Eisenstaedt was born in [[Tczew|Dirschau (Tczew)]] in [[West Prussia]], [[German Empire|Imperial Germany]] in 1898.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| last1 = Zone, Ray| title = Alfred Eisenstaedt | date = | year = 2007 | url = http://artscenecal.com/ArticlesFile/Archive/Articles1997/Articles0397/AEisenstaedt.html| postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; His family was [[Jews|Jewish]] and moved to [[Berlin]] in 1906. Eisenstaedt was fascinated by photography from his youth and began taking pictures at age 14 when he was given his first camera, an [[Kodak|Eastman Kodak]] [[Folding camera|Folding Camera]] with [[roll film]]. He later served in the [[German Army]]'s [[artillery]] during [[World War I]] and was wounded in 1918. While working as a belt and button [[sales]]man in the 1920s in [[Weimar Republic|Weimar Germany]], Eisenstaedt began taking photographs as a [[freelancer]] for the Pacific and Atlantic Photos' Berlin office in 1928. The office was taken over by the [[Associated Press]] in 1931.

==Professional photographer==
Eisenstaedt became a full-time photographer in 1929 when he was hired by the [[Associated Press]] office in Germany, and within a year he was described as a "photographer extraordinaire."&lt;ref name=Life/&gt; He also worked for ''Illustrierte Zeitung'', published by [[Ullstein Verlag]], then the world's largest [[Publishing|publishing house]].&lt;ref name=Life/&gt; Four years later he photographed the famous first meeting between [[Adolf Hitler]] and [[Benito Mussolini]] in [[Italy]]. Other notable early pictures by Eisenstaedt include his depiction of a [[Waiting staff|waiter]] at the ice rink of the Grand Hotel in [[St. Moritz]] in 1932 and [[Joseph Goebbels]] at the [[League of Nations]] in [[Geneva]] in 1933. Although initially friendly, Goebbels scowled at Eisenstaedt when he took the photograph.&lt;ref&gt;[http://life.time.com/history/goebbels-in-geneva-1933-behind-a-classic-alfred-eisenstaedt-photo Behind the Picture: Joseph Goebbels Glares at the Camera, Geneva].&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1935, [[Fascism|Fascist]] Italy's impending [[Second Italo-Ethiopian War|invasion of Ethiopia]] led to a burst of international interest in [[Ethiopia]]. While working for ''[[Berliner Illustrirte Zeitung|Berliner Illustrierte Zeitung]]'', Alfred took over 3,500 photographs in Ethiopia, before emigrating to the [[United States]], where he joined [[Life (magazine)|''Life'' magazine]], but returned in the following year to Ethiopia to continue his photography.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Ethiopia Photographed: Historic Photographs of the Country and its People Taken Between 1867 and 1935|last=Pankhurst|first=Richard|last2=Gérard|first2=Denis|publisher=Kegan Paul International|year=1996|isbn=9780710305046|location=London|pages=34}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eisenstaedt's family was Jewish. [[Oppression]] in Hitler's [[Nazi Germany]] caused them to [[Emigration|emigrate]] to the U.S.&lt;ref name=Ciment/&gt; They arrived in 1935 and settled in [[New York (state)|New York]], where he subsequently became a [[naturalized citizen]],&lt;ref name="Oxford"&gt;Morgan, Ann Lee. ed. ''The Oxford Dictionary of American Art and Artists'', Oxford Univ. Press (2007) pp. 144–145&lt;/ref&gt; and joined fellow [[Associated Press]] émigrés Leon Daniel and Celia Kutschuk in their [[PIX Publishing]] photo agency founded that year. The following year, 1936, ''[[Time magazine|Time]]'' founder [[Henry Luce]] bought [[Life (magazine)|''Life'']] magazine, and Eisenstaedt, already noted for his photography in Europe,&lt;ref name="Life" /&gt; was asked to join the new magazine as one of its original staff of four photographers, including [[Margaret Bourke-White]] and [[Robert Capa]].&lt;ref name=Ciment&gt;Ciment, James. ed. ''The Home Front Encyclopedia'', ABC-CLIO (2007) p. 585&lt;/ref&gt; He remained a staff photographer from 1936 to 1972, achieving notability for his [[photojournalism]] of news events and celebrities.&lt;ref name=obit/&gt;

Along with entertainers and celebrities, he photographed politicians, philosophers, artists, industrialists, and authors during his career with ''Life''. By 1972 he had photographed nearly 2,500 stories and had more than 90 of his photos on the cover.&lt;ref name=NYMagazine/&gt; With ''Life'''s circulation of two million readers, Eisenstaedt's reputation increased substantially.&lt;ref name=Life/&gt; According to one historian, "his photographs have a power and a symbolic resonance that made him one of the best ''Life'' photographers."&lt;ref name=Marter/&gt; In subsequent years, he also worked for ''[[Harper's Bazaar]]'', ''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]'', ''[[Town &amp; Country (magazine)|Town &amp; Country]]'' and others.&lt;ref name=Marter&gt;Marter, Joan M. ed. ''The Grove Encyclopedia of American Art'', Vol I, Oxford Univ. Press, (2011) p. 156&lt;/ref&gt;

===Style and technique===
From his early years as professional photographer he became an enthusiast for small [[35 mm film]] cameras, especially the [[Leica camera]]. Unlike most news photographers at the time who relied on much larger and less portable 4"×5" [[press camera]]s with flash attachments, Eisenstaedt preferred the smaller hand-held Leica, which gave him greater speed and more flexibility when shooting news events or capturing [[Candid photography|candids]] of people in action.&lt;ref name=Oxford/&gt; His photos were also notable as a result of his typical use of [[Available light|natural light]] as opposed to relying of [[Flash (photography)|flash lighting]].&lt;ref name=Oxford/&gt; In 1944, ''Life'' described him as the "dean of today's miniature-camera experts."&lt;ref name=Life&gt;"Speaking of Pictures: Eisenstaedt has a 15th Anniversary", ''Life'' magazine, Sept. 4, 1944 p. 13&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time, this style of [[photojournalism]], with a smaller camera with its ability to use available light, was then in its infancy.&lt;ref name=NYMagazine/&gt; It also helped Eisenstaedt create a more relaxed atmosphere when shooting famous people where he was able to capture more natural poses and expressions: "They don't take me too seriously with my little camera," he stated. "I don't come as a photographer. I come as a friend."&lt;ref name=NYMagazine/&gt; It was a style he learned from his 35 years in Europe, where he preferred shooting informal, unposed portraits, along with extended picture stories. As a result, ''Life'' began using more such photo stories, with the magazine becoming a recognized source of such photojournalism of the world's luminaries.&lt;ref name=NYMagazine/&gt; Of ''Life's'' photographers, Eisenstaedt was most noted for his "[[Human interest story|human interest]]" photos and less the hard news images used by most news publications.&lt;ref name=NYMagazine/&gt;

His success at establishing a relaxed setting for his subjects was not without difficulties, however, when he needed to capture the feeling he wanted. [[Anthony Eden]], resistant to being photographed, called Eisenstaedt "the gentle executioner."&lt;ref name=NYMagazine/&gt; Similarly, [[Winston Churchill]] told him where to place the camera to get a good picture,&lt;ref name=NYMagazine/&gt; and during a [[photo shoot]] of [[Ernest Hemingway]] in his boat, Hemingway, in a rage, tore his own shirt to shreds and threatened to throw Eisenstaedt overboard.&lt;ref name=NYMagazine/&gt;

===Martha's Vineyard===
[[File:ClintonsEise copy.JPG|thumb|right|Eisenstaedt photographing the Clinton family on Martha's Vineyard.]]
Eisenstaedt, known as "Eisie" to his close friends, enjoyed his annual August vacations on the island of [[Martha's Vineyard]] for 50 years. During these summers, he would conduct photographic experiments, working with different lenses, filters, and prisms in natural light. Eisenstaedt was fond of Martha's Vineyard's photogenic [[lighthouse]]s and was the focus of lighthouse fundraisers organized by Vineyard Environmental Research Institute (VERI).

Two years before his death, Eisenstaedt photographed President [[Bill Clinton]] with wife [[Hillary Clinton|Hillary]] and daughter [[Chelsea Clinton|Chelsea]]. The session took place at the Granary Gallery in [[West Tisbury, Massachusetts|West Tisbury]] on Martha's Vineyard and was documented by a photograph published in [[People (magazine)|''People'']] magazine on September 13, 1993.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20106211,00.html "Star Tracks"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150908164616/http://www.people.com/people/article/0%2C%2C20106211%2C00.html |date=2015-09-08 }}, ''People'', Sept. 13, 1993&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life and death==
After first settling in New York City in 1935, Eisenstaedt lived in [[Jackson Heights, Queens]], New York, for the rest of his life. Until shortly before his death, he would walk daily from his home to his ''Life'' office on the [[Sixth Avenue (Manhattan)|Avenue of the Americas]] and [[51st Street (Manhattan)|51st Street]].&lt;ref&gt;Grundberg, Andy.

Accessed September 25, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

He died in his bed at midnight at his beloved Menemsha Inn cottage known as the "Pilot House" at age 96&lt;ref name=obit&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Alfred Eisenstaedt, Photographer of the Defining Moment, Is Dead at 96 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/learning/general/onthisday/bday/1206.html |quote=Alfred Eisenstaedt, the German photographer whose pioneering images for ''Life'' magazine helped define American photojournalism, died on Wednesday while vacationing on Martha's Vineyard in Massachusetts. He had been living primarily in Manhattan. |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=1995-08-25 |accessdate=2007-07-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in the company of his sister-in-law, Lucille Kaye (LuLu),&lt;ref name=Lulu&gt;Meras, Phyllis. [http://www.mvgazette.com/article.php?46627 "Lulu Kaye Was Keeper of Eisie Flame"], ''Vineyard Gazette'', August 20, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; and friend, William E. Marks.&lt;ref&gt;[http://digitaljournalist.org/issue9911/marks.htm "Vineyard Time with Eisie"], ''The Digital Journalist''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable Eisenstaedt photos==
*''V-J day in Times Square''
{{main|V-J Day in Times Square}} Eisenstaedt's most famous photograph is of an American sailor grabbing and kissing a stranger—a young woman—on August 14, 1945 in [[Times Square]]. He took this photograph using a Leica IIIa. (The photograph is known under various names: ''[[V-J Day in Times Square]], V-Day,'' and others.&lt;ref&gt;''V-J day in Times Square'': ''The Photo Book'' (London: Phaidon, 2000; {{ISBN|0-7148-3937-X}}), p.134. ''V–Day'': ''Twentieth Century Photography: Museum Ludwig Cologne'' (Cologne: Taschen, 2005; {{ISBN|3-8228-4083-1}}), pp. 148–9.&lt;/ref&gt;) Because Eisenstaedt was photographing rapidly changing events during the [[V-J Day]] celebrations, he stated that he did not get a chance to obtain names and details, which has encouraged a number of mutually [[V-J Day in Times Square#Identity of the kissers|incompatible claims]] to the identities of the subjects.
&lt;!-- And if you have something worthwhile to say about one or more of these claims, please say it within the article on "V-J day in Times Square"; not here.--&gt;
* ''Portraits of Sophia Loren''
The portraits of [[Sophia Loren]] have been described{{by whom|date=September 2015}} as conveying mischievousness, dignity, and love on the part of both Eisenstaedt and Loren.
*''Ice Skating Waiter, St. Moritz''
This 1932 photograph depicts a waiter at the ice rink of the Grand Hotel. "I did one smashing picture", Eisenstaedt wrote, "of the skating headwaiter. To be sure the picture was sharp, I put a chair on the ice and asked the waiter to skate by it. I had a Miroflex camera and focused on the chair."&lt;ref&gt;Alfred Eisentaedt - BBC Masters Photographers (1983).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards==
*1989: [[National Medal of Arts]]. Awarded by President [[George H. W. Bush]] in a ceremony on the [[White House]] lawn.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nea.gov/honors/medals/medalists_year.html#89 Lifetime Honors – National Medal of Arts] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721054307/http://www.nea.gov/honors/medals/medalists_year.html |date=2011-07-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Defensive walls are a feature of [[ancient Roman architecture]].  The Romans generally fortified cities, rather than building stand-alone fortresses, but there are some fortified camps, such as the [[Saxon Shore#The forts|Saxon Shore forts]] like [[Portus Adurni|Porchester Castle]] in England.  City walls were already significant in [[Etruscan architecture]], and in the struggle for control of Italy under the early Republic many more were built, using different techniques.  These included tightly-fitting massive irregular polygonal blocks, shaped to fit exactly in a way reminiscent of later [[Inca]] work. The Romans called a simple rampart wall an [[Agger (ancient Rome)|agger]]; at this date great height was not necessary. The [[Servian Wall]] around Rome was an ambitious project of the early 4th century BC. The wall was up to 10&amp;nbsp;metres (32.8&amp;nbsp;ft) in height in places, 3.6&amp;nbsp;metres (12&amp;nbsp;ft) wide at its base, 11&amp;nbsp;km (7&amp;nbsp;mi) long,&lt;ref&gt;Fields, Nic; Peter Dennis ''The Walls of Rome'' Osprey Publishing; 10 Mar 2008 {{ISBN|978-1-84603-198-4}} p.10 [https://books.google.com/books?id=SDxrLQymWWwC&amp;pg=PA10&amp;dq=height+servian+wall&amp;as_brr=3#PPA10,M1]&lt;/ref&gt; and is believed to have had 16 main gates, though many of these are mentioned only from writings, with no other known remains.  Some of it had a ''fossa'' or ditch in front, and an agger behind, and it was enough to deter [[Hannibal]]. Later the [[Aurelian Wall]] replaced it, enclosing an expanded city, and using more sophisticated designs, with small forts at intervals.

The Romans walled major cities and towns in areas they saw as vulnerable, and parts of many walls remain incorporated in later defences, as at [[Roman walls of Córdoba|Córdoba]] (2nd century BC), [[Chester city walls|Chester]] (earth and wood in the 70s AD, stone from c. 100), and [[York city walls|York]] (from 70s AD).  Strategic walls [[Roman military frontiers and fortifications|defending the frontiers of the Empire]] by running across open country were far rarer, and [[Hadrian's Wall]] (from 122) and the [[Antonine Wall]] (from 142, abandoned only 8 years after completion) are the most significant examples, both on the [[Picts|Pictish]] frontier.  Most defences of the [[borders of the Roman Empire]] relied on [[limes|systems of forts and roads]] without attempting a continuous barrier.

== Examples==

Notable walls built by [[ancient Rome]] include, in chronological order of construction:

* [[Servian Wall]], built around Rome in the early 4th century BC
* [[Roman walls of Córdoba]]
* Colchester town walls, built after the [[Boudica | Boudiccan revolt]] c.65–80 A.D
* [[Chester city walls]], originating as part of the fortress of Deva Victrix between 70 and 80 AD
* [[York city walls]], originally constructed around 71 AD when York was a Roman colony
* [[Hadrian's Wall]], built in England beginning in 122 AD at the edge of Roman conquest to keep out the Scots
* [[Antonine Wall]], a short-lived, advanced frontier wall built in Scotland north of Hadrian's Wall beginning in 142 AD
* [[London Wall]], built around Londinium between 190 and 225, probably between 200 and 220
* [[Roman walls of Lugo]], built between 263 and 276 AD to defend the Roman town of Lucus Augusti (in what is now Spain)
* [[Aurelian Walls]], the later wall of Rome, built in the late 3rd century AD
* [[Walls of Constantinople]], a great defensive wall that defended the metropolitan capital from the fourth century AD until 1453
* [[Anastasian Wall]], a wall named built in the late 5th century to ensure extra defenses for Constantinople. It was not very effective, and was abandoned in the 7th century.
* [[Venta Silurum, Caerwent, Wales]], Venta Silurum was a town in the Roman province of Britannia. The walls are some of the best examples in the UK.

It comprised an [[exhibition]], a [[publication]] and a [[lecture]] series that all focused on the heart and brain in various fields: [[art]], [[science]], [[religion]], the [[occult]] and [[cooking]], in order to reflect on the philosophical and practical relationship between art and science.&lt;ref&gt;Begrepp en Samling, 1992, ed.

In the exhibition, one could see two large metal and glass sculptures of the heart and the brain that contained the crumbled posters promoting the exhibition. Large photographs of histological samples of the two organs sat next to scientific abstracts, occult and religious images. Close to the entry of the exhibition, hearts and brains of various animals including and elephant and a lemur which had been lent by the Museum of Natural History sat next to recipes of how to cook the organs.&lt;ref&gt;Tjugo år : Maria Bonnier Dahlins stiftelse : 1985-2005, Ed.

{{French literature}}
This article is about [[French literature]] from the  year 2000 to the present day.

== Overview ==
The economic, political and social crises of contemporary France -terrorism, violence, immigration, unemployment, racism, etc.—and (for some) the notion that France has lost its sense of identity and international prestige—through the rise of American hegemony, the growth of Europe and of [[global capitalism]] ({{lang-fr|mondialisation}})—have created what some critics (like [[Nancy Huston]]) have seen as a new form of detached [[nihilism]], reminiscent of the 50s and 60s ([[Samuel Beckett|Beckett]], [[Emil Cioran|Cioran]]). The best known of these authors is [[Michel Houellebecq]], whose ''[[Atomised]]'' ({{lang-fr|Les particules élémentaires}}) was a major international phenomenon.  These tendencies have also come under attack. In one of her essays, Nancy Huston criticises Houellebecq for his nihilism; she also makes an acerbic censure of his novels in her work ''The teachers of despair'' ({{lang-fr|Professeurs de désespoir}}).{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}}

Although the contemporary social and political context can be felt in recent works, overall, French literature written in past decades has been disengaged from explicit political discussion (unlike the authors of the 1930s–1940s or the generation of 1968) and has focused on the intimate and the anecdotal.{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}} It has tended to no longer see itself as a means of criticism or world transformation, with some notable exceptions (such as [[Michel Houellebecq]] or [[Maurice Dantec]]).{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}}

Other contemporary writers during the last decade have consciously used the process of "[[autofiction]]" (similar to the notion of "[[Faction (literature)|faction]]") to renew the novel ([[Christine Angot]] for example). "Autofiction" is a term invented by [[Serge Doubrovsky]] in 1977. It is a new sort of romanticised autobiography that resembles the writing of the romantics of the nineteenth century. A few other authors may be perceived as vaguely belonging to this group: [[Alice Ferney]], [[Annie Ernaux]], [[Olivia Rosenthal]], [[Anne Wiazemsky]], and [[Vassilis Alexakis]].  In a related vein, [[Catherine Millet]]'s 2002 memoir ''[[The Sexual Life of Catherine M.]]'' gained much press for its frank exploration of the author's sexual experiences.{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}}

Contemporary French authors include:  [[Jonathan Littell]],  [[David Foenkinos]], [[Jean-Michel Espitallier]], [[Christophe Tarkos]], [[Olivier Cadiot]], [[Chloé Delaume]],  [[Patrick Bouvet]], [[Charles Pennequin]],  [[Nathalie Quintane]], [[Frédéric-Yves Jeannet]], [[Nina Bouraoui]], [[Hubries le Dieu]], [[Arno Bertina]], [[Edouard Levé]], [[Bruno Guiblet]], [[Christophe Fiat]], and [[Tristan Garcia]].

Many of the most lauded works in French over the last decades have been written by individuals from former French colonies or overseas possessions. This [[Francophone literature]] includes the novels of [[Ahmadou Kourouma]] ([[Côte d'Ivoire]]), [[Tahar ben Jelloun]] ([[Morocco]]), [[Patrick Chamoiseau]] ([[Martinique]]), [[Amin Maalouf]] ([[Lebanon]]), [[Mehdi Belhaj Kacem]] ([[Tunisia]]) and [[Assia Djebar]] ([[Algeria]]).

France has a number of important [[Literary award|literary awards]] [[Grand Prix du roman de l'Académie française]], [[Prix Décembre]], [[Prix Femina]], [[Prix Flore]], [[Prix Goncourt]], [[Prix Interallié]], [[Prix Médicis]], and [[Prix Renaudot]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.prix-litteraires.net/prix/1971,prix-des-prix-litteraires.html Prix des Prix Littéraires], prix-litteraires.net&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011 a new, controversial, award was created called [[Prix des prix littéraires]] ("Prize of Literary Prizes") which picks its winner from among the winners of these prizes.&lt;ref&gt;Laurent Martinet, ''L'Express'', 15, 12, 2011, "[https://www.lexpress.fr/culture/livre/a-quoi-bon-un-prix-des-prix-litteraires_1061847.html A quoi bon un prix des prix littéraires]''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Extrême contemporain==
The term '''''extrême contemporain''''' is a French expression used to indicate French literary production published in France in the last 10 years.&lt;ref&gt;2000–2010&lt;/ref&gt; The ''extrême contemporain'' is, then, an ever-shifting concept.

This term was used for the first time by French writer Michel Chaillou in 1989{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}. This simple and convenient definition hides a complex and chaotic literary situation, both from the chronological point of view (the temporal boundaries of the ''extrême contemporain'' are in continuous shifting) and for the hetereogeneity of present French literary production, which cannot be defined in a clear and homogeneous way.  The term ''extrême contemporain'', therefore, is all-inclusive. The literary production of this period is characterized by a transitory quality; because of the manifolded nature of such an immense corpus of texts, the identification of specific tendencies is inevitably partial and precarious.

Therefore, to define the ''extrême contemporain'' as a [[literary movement]] would be very improper: it is a mere term of convenience used by commentators and not by the authors themselves.

The ''extrême contemporain'' can be seen as a "literary constellation" hardly organized in schemes. In some cases, authors of the ''extrême contemporain'' follow an "aesthetics of fragments":  their narration is broken into pieces or they show, like Pascal Quignard, for instance, a preference for short sentences. The "apportionment" of knowledge can also be carried out by the use of a chaotic verbal stream, the [[interior monologue]], [[tropism]]s, repetition and endophasy. The feeling of uncertainty experience by writers leads him to put in question the notion of novel and its very form, preferring the more general notion of ''récit''. Then, a return to reality takes place: in [[Pierre Bergounioux]]'s works, readers witness the cultural upsetting concerning generations which follow one another; [[François Bon]] describes the exclusion from social and industrial reality; many authors of crime stories, like [[Jean-Patrick Manchette]] and [[Didier Daeninckx]], describe social and political reality, and so it does [[Maurice G. Dantec]] in his works halfway between [[Spy fiction|spy stories]] and science fiction; on another side, [[Annie Ernaux]]'s ''écriture plate'' ("flat writing") tries to demolish the distance between reality and its narration.

Subjects are shown in a persistent state of crisis. However, a return to everyday life and trivial habits also takes place: the attention is focused to the "outcasts of literature", like, for instance, old people. This use of triviality and everyday life expresses itself in a new sort of "[[minimalism]]": from [[Pierre Michon]]'s ''Small lives'' fictional biographies of unknown people, to [[Philippe Delerm]]'s "small pleasures". The facets of this [[minimalism]] manifest themselves in many ways, through the triviality of the subject, through short forms, or through concise and bare phrases. On one hand, heroicized characters try to build up their own individual way against a senseless reality, so that emarginated or marginal people emerge through the building up of their own story; on the other hand, a "negative [[minimalism]]" takes place: characters stagnate in social and relational difficulties.

The '''UNESCO Convention on the Protection and Promotion of the Diversity of Cultural Expressions''' is a binding international legal instrument&lt;ref&gt;[http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0014/001495/149502e.pdf 30 frequently asked questions concerning the Convention and Promotion of the Diversity of Cultural Expressions]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[UNESCO]] [[multilateral treaty|convention]] adopted by the UNESCO General Conference on 20 October 2005, during the 33rd session of the UNESCO General Conference held in Paris, France on 3–21 October 2005. The convention compliments the previously established provisions of UNESCO including the Universal Declaration on Cultural Diversity of 2001. "The Convention recognises the rights of Parties to take measures to protect and promote the diversity of cultural expressions, and impose obligations at both domestic and international levels on Parties."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fco.gov.uk/en/publications-and-documents/treaty-command-papers-ems/explanatory-memoranda/explanatory-memoranda-2007a/unesco United Kingdom Foreign and Commonwealth Office]&lt;/ref&gt; The Convention is available in six authoritative texts including Arabic, Chinese, English, French, Russian and Spanish.&lt;ref&gt;[http://portal.unesco.org/en/ev.php-URL_ID=31038&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html Convention on the Protection and Promotion of the Diversity of Cultural Expressions 2005]&lt;/ref&gt;

As of December 2016, the Convention has 146 parties&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/eri/la/convention.asp?KO=31038&amp;language=E|title=Conventions|website=www.unesco.org|access-date=2018-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;, which includes 145 states and the [[European Union]].

==Background==
The Convention on the Protection and Promotion of the Diversity of Cultural Expressions is a precursor for seven UNESCO conventions which deal with the four core areas of creative diversity; cultural and natural heritage, movable cultural property, intangible cultural heritage and contemporary creativity.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;[http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0014/001495/149502e.pdf Ten Keys to the Convention on the Protection and Promotion of the Diversity of Cultural Expressions]&lt;/ref&gt; These seven UNESCO conventions include the Universal Copyright Convention (1952, followed by a revision in 1971), the Convention for the Protection and Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict (1954/1999), the Convention on the Means of Prohibiting and Preventing the Illicit Import, Export and Transfer of Ownership of Cultural Property (1970), the Convention Concerning the Protection of World Cultural and Natural Heritage (1972), the Convention on the Protection of the Underwater Cultural Heritage (2001), the Convention for the Safeguarding of the Intangible Cultural Heritage (2003),and the Convention on the Protection and Promotion of the Diversity of Cultural Expressions (2005).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The Convention on the Protection and Promotion of the Diversity of Cultural Expressions deals with specific articles in the UNESCO Universal Declaration on Cultural Diversity, Articles 8 through 11. These articles clarify three issues. First, the relationship that identity has with cultural goods and services, which values and meaning should not be treated as economic goods. Second, the States have the responsibility for the protection and promotion for the "diversity of cultural expressions and ensuring the free flow of ideas and works".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Third, there needs to be international co-operation.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The Convention on the Protection and Promotion of the Diversity of Cultural Expressions is a legally binding international agreement that ensures artists, cultural professionals, practitioners and citizens worldwide can create, produce, disseminate and enjoy a broad range of cultural goods, services and activities, including their own.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unesco.org/new/en/culture/themes/cultural-diversity/2005-convention/the-convention/what-is-the-convention/ UNESCO 2005 Convention]&lt;/ref&gt; Cultural expressions are conveyed by activities, goods and services, which results in an economic and cultural nature. Due to this dual sided nature, cultural expressions cannot be seen purely as objects of trade.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The Convention on the Protection and Promotion of the Diversity of Cultural Expressions main objective is to strengthen creation, production, distribution/dissemination, access and enjoyment of cultural expressions transmitted by cultural activities, goods and services, with a strong focus on developing countries.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The promotion of dialogue and creativity of cultural diversity is an necessary element in the goal to achieve peace and sustainable development.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The Convention was adopted in response to  "growing pressure exerted on countries to waive their right to enforce cultural policies and to put all aspects of the cultural sector on the table when negotiating international trade agreements."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cdc-ccd.org/IMG/pdf/CDC_LowRez_EN.pdf Coalition for Cultural Diversity]&lt;/ref&gt; "The international community signalled the urgency to implement an international law that would recognize the distinctive nature of cultural goods, services and activities as vehicles of identity, values and meaning and that while cultural goods, services and activities have important economic value, they are not mere commodities or consumer goods that can only be regarded as objects of trade."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unesco.org/new/en/culture/themes/cultural-diversity/2005-convention/the-convention/what-is-the-convention/ UNESCO 2005 Convention]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Convention's main objective is to provide a legally binding international agreement that reaffirms the sovereign right of States to adopt cultural policies that support their cultural industries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cdc-ccd.org/IMG/pdf/CDC_LowRez_EN.pdf Coalition for Cultural Diversity]&lt;/ref&gt; The Convention does not want to control and restrict cultural expressions, but to promote and protect them.&lt;ref&gt;[http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0014/001495/149502e.pdf Ten Keys to the Convention on the Protection and Promotion of the Diversity of Cultural Expressions]&lt;/ref&gt; Recognizing that the diversity of cultural expressions is a "rich asset for individuals and societies, the protection, promotion and maintenance of [[cultural diversity]] are an essential requirement for [[sustainable development]] for the benefit of present and future generations.".&lt;ref&gt;''UNESCO Convention on the Protection and Promotion of the Diversity of Cultural Expressions'', Article 2 Paragraph 6 [http://www.unesco.org/new/en/culture/themes/cultural-diversity/2005-convention/the-convention/convention-text/]&lt;/ref&gt; The Convention also defines on [[cultural industry]] and [[interculturality]]&lt;ref&gt;''UNESCO Convention on the Protection and Promotion of the Diversity of Cultural Expressions'', Article 4 Paragraph 8&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Since the late 1980s, a growing number of countries were showing concern that "the proliferation of trade agreements promoting absolute market liberalization dramatically increased the threat to [[cultural industry|cultural industries]]. Countries wishing to retain their right to enforce cultural policies risked being marginalized and unable to maintain their position."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cdc-ccd.org/IMG/pdf/CDC_LowRez_EN.pdf Coalition for Cultural Diversity]&lt;/ref&gt;

*In 2001, the [[Universal Declaration on Cultural Diversity|UNESCO Universal Declaration on Cultural Diversity]] was adopted&lt;ref&gt;[http://portal.unesco.org/culture/en/ev.php-URL_ID=35232&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html ''UNESCO Universal Declaration on Cultural Diversity'']&lt;/ref&gt; and 21 May was declared the  [[World Day for Cultural Diversity for Dialogue and Development]]

The preliminary draft was drawn up over a series of two years, 2003–2005. The Director-General of UNESCO assigned fifteen experts to write a draft called the Convention on the Protection of the Diversity of Cultural Contents and Artistic Expressions. Meetings were held for suggested improvements and the draft eventually led to the adoption of the Convention on the Protection and Promotion of the Diversity of Cultural Expressions on 20 October 2005.&lt;ref&gt;[http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0014/001495/149502e.pdf 30 frequently asked questions concerning the Convention and Promotion of the Diversity of Cultural Expressions]&lt;/ref&gt;

The main objective for the Convention on the Protection and Promotion of the Diversity of Cultural Expressions is to protect and promote the diversity of cultural expressions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0014/001495/149502e.pdf 30 frequently asked questions concerning the Convention and Promotion of the Diversity of Cultural Expressions]&lt;/ref&gt; The Convention highlights the fact that cultural creativity has been placed upon all of humanity and that aside from economical gains, creative diversity reaps plenty of cultural and social advantages.&lt;ref&gt;[http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0014/001495/149502e.pdf Ten Keys to the Convention on the Protection and Promotion of the Diversity of Cultural Expressions]&lt;/ref&gt; States must also promote "openness to other cultures of the world". Protective measures are also included in the Convention and international co-operation is encouraged in times of need. This Convention works to strengthen economic growth and cultural acceptance.

Additional objectives are as follows:

*To reaffirm the sovereign rights of States to adopt cultural policies while ensuring the free movement of ideas and works.
*To recognise the distinct nature of cultural goods and services as vehicles of values, identity and meaning.
*To define a new framework for international cultural co-operation, the keystone of the Convention
*To create the conditions for cultures to flourish and freely interact in a mutually beneficial manner
*To endeavour to support co-operation for [[sustainable development]] and [[poverty reduction]], via assistance from the International Fund for Cultural Diversity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0021/002148/214824e.pdf Basic Texts of the 2005 Convention on the Protection and Promotion of the Diversity of Cultural Expressions]&lt;/ref&gt;
*To ensure that civil society plays a major role in the implementation of the Convention.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ifccd.com/ International Federation of Coalitions for Cultural Diversity (IFCCD)]&lt;/ref&gt;
*To "strengthen international cooperation and solidarity with a view to favouring the cultural expressions of all countries, in particular those whose cultural goods and services suffer from lack of access to the means of creation, production and dissemination at the national and international level."&lt;ref&gt;[http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0014/001495/149502e.pdf 30 frequently asked questions concerning the Convention and Promotion of the Diversity of Cultural Expressions]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Convention also affirms that "Cultural diversity can be protected and promoted only if human rights and fundamental freedoms, such as freedom of expression, information and communication, as well as the ability of individuals to choose cultural expresions, are guaranteed."&lt;ref&gt;''UNESCO Convention on the Protection and Promotion of the Diversity of Cultural Expressions'', Article 2, Paragraph 1&lt;/ref&gt; in a manner against a [[cultural relativism]] that may undermine universality of human rights.

'''''Creation of the World''''' is a [[mosaic]] composition in the dome of the [[Chigi Chapel]] in [[Santa Maria del Popolo]], [[Rome]], designed by [[Raphael]]. The chapel itself was designed by Raphael for his friend and patron, banker [[Agostino Chigi]] as a private chapel and family burial place. The dome was decorated with mosaics, a somewhat unusual and old-fashioned technique in the 16th century. Raphael's cartoons were executed by a Venetian craftsman, Luigi da Pace in 1516. The original cartoons were lost but some preparatory drawings, that confirm the originality of the work, survived in the [[Ashmolean Museum]], [[Oxford]]. There are two studies for the figure of God and one for the angel above Jupiter. Another drawing in the [[Palais des Beaux-Arts de Lille|Palais des Beaux-Arts]] in [[Lille]] shows the planet Mars with an angel. This is probably a creative drawing by a pupil suggested by its inferior quality.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Joannides: ''The Drawings of Raphael: With a Complete Catalogue'', University of California Press, Berkeley, 1983, p.231&lt;/ref&gt; Luigi da Pace signed and dated the work at the corner of the panel of Venus:&lt;ref&gt;Nicole Riegel: Die Chigi-Kapelle in Santa Maria del Popolo. Eine kritische Revision, Marburger Jahrbuch für Kunstwissenschaft, 30. Bd. (2003), p. 97&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Description==
[[File:Raphaels ashmolean angel.jpg|thumb|left|180px|Preparatory drawing by Raphael.]]
The central roundel represents God, the Father, surrounded by putti, effectively foreshortened in an impetuous gesture, harking back to [[Michelangelo]], which seems to give rise to the entire motion of the universe below. Eight mosaic panels show the Sun, the Moon, the starry sky and the six known planets as pagan deities depicted in half-length, each accompanied by an angel with colourful feathered wings. The figures are accompanied by the signs of the zodiac.

The sequence of the panels is as follows: the sky; [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]], the god holding the [[caduceus]] (with [[Virgo (astrology)|Virgo]] and [[Gemini (astrology)|Gemini]]); [[Luna (goddess)|Luna]], the crescent moon jewelled goddess holding a bow (with [[Cancer (astrology)|Cancer]]); [[Saturn (mythology)|Saturn]], the bearded god holding the scythe (with [[Aquarius (astrology)|Aquarius]] and [[Capricorn (astrology)|Capricorn]]); [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]], the king of the gods with his eagle holding a thunderbolt (with [[Sagittarius (astrology)|Sagittarius]] and [[Pisces (astrology)|Pisces]]); [[Mars (mythology)|Mars]], the god of war holding a sword and a shield (with [[Scorpio (astrology)|Scorpio]] and [[Aries (astrology)|Aries]]); [[Sol (mythology)|Sol]], the sun-jewelled god holding a bow (with [[Leo (astrology)|Leo]]); [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]], the goddess of love with [[Cupid]] holding a torch as the Evening Star (with [[Taurus (astrology)|Taurus]] and [[Libra (astrology)|Libra]]). A French engraver, [[Nicolas Dorigny]] created a series of plates depicting the mosaics in 1695 for [[Louis, Duke of Burgundy]].

The mosaic panels are surrounded by richly gilded stucco decoration. The blue background creates an optical illusion giving the impression of an architectural framework opening to the sky above the chapel. The panels look like illusionistic skylights between the gilt stucco ribs while God is standing on the edge of the central oculus.&lt;ref&gt;John Shearman: The Chigi Chapel in S. Maria del Popolo, Journal of the Warburg and Courtauld Institutes, Vol. 24, No. 3/4 (Jul. - Dec., 1961)&lt;/ref&gt;

The traditional interpretation of the dome is that the composition shows the ''Creation of the World''. Another (disputed) interpretation claims that it represents the cosmos as described by [[Plato]] in a Christianized [[Neoplatonism|Neoplatonist]] form. This idea had a widespread popularity in the Renaissance. In this case the dome is a depiction of the Realm of the Soul after Death with God, the Father receiving the soul (of Agostino Chigi) in his new home. The presence of the signs of the zodiac corroborates this interpretation because the signs were symbols of the passage of time in eternity, and they appeared in antique funeral art around the image of the departed.

Nicole Riegel emphasized the role of the angels in the composition: "In view of the important, anything but accessory position of the angels in the panels, there is an unmistakable effort for a reconciliation or interfusion of the Pagan and Christian life view."&lt;ref&gt;Op. cit. p. 113&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[visual art]]s, '''creative peacebuilding''' offers a creative means to bring about peace within conflicted contexts. The use of the visual arts for effective [[peacebuilding]] emphasizes a consideration of the nature of the context where the tool is applied by not necessarily following a set format or paradigm. It reflects the potential to transcend traditional ideas, rules, patterns, relationships, or the like, to create meaningful new ideas, forms, methods, and interpretations geared towards establishing and sustaining peace.

Generally speaking, ''[[the arts]]'' refers to the theory and the physical expressions of creativity found in human societies and cultures. The major constituents of the arts include [[literature]] (poetry, novels, short stories, and epic poetry), [[performing arts]] (music, dance, and theatre), and the [[visual arts]], the last of which includes creations that can be seen. According to the [[Merriam-Webster dictionary]], the term "creative" describes a quality of something created rather than imitated.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/creative|title=Definition of Creative|website=Merriam-Webster|language=en|access-date=10 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In light of this, [[creative peacebuilding]] is a broad term for creative therapeutic strategies to create peace, within individuals, groups, and societies in conflict situations. Although used primarily to overcome violence, creative peacebuilding is also a preventative measure explored to establish stronger foundations of peaceful initiatives, especially when used with children.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite web |date=12 August 2013 |title=Selected Definitions of Peacebuilding |url=http://www.allianceforpeacebuilding.org/2013/08/selected-definitions-of-peacebuilding/ |location=Washington |publisher=Alliance for Peacebuilding |access-date=10 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Definitions of peacebuilding ==
[[Peacebuilding]] is a process that facilitates the establishment of sustainable peace by preventing the recurrence of violence through different approaches which address the root causes and effects of conflict. Peacebuilding is an alternative to violence through reconciliation, and economic and social transformation.

The term ''peacebuilding'' has been widely used since 1992,{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} when it was used by the former [[United Nations]] Secretary-General [[Boutros Boutros-Ghali]] in his ''[[An Agenda for Peace]]''. Boutros-Ghali described peacebuilding as "action to identify and support structures, which will tend to strengthen and solidify peace in order to avoid a relapse into conflict."{{sfn|Boutros-Ghali|1992|p=6}}

According to [[Johan Galtung]], peacebuilding is the process of creating self-supporting structures that "remove causes of wars and offer alternatives to war in situations where wars might occur."&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; For [[John Paul Lederach]], peacebuilding is a comprehensive concept that encompasses, generates, and sustains the full array of processes, approaches, and stages needed to transform conflict toward more sustainable, peaceful relationships, which involves a wide range of activities. It has a diverse range of interaction and involves various stakeholders in various levels within the spectrum of governance and development.{{sfn|Lederach|2005}}{{page needed|date=November 2017}}

== Peacebuilding through the visual arts ==
If [[visual arts]] are artistic expressions that can be seen in their diversity rather than heard, then the relationship between visual arts and creative peacebuilding is reflected in the felt experience of [[creative peacebuilding]] in conflict situations. Visual arts are created to stimulate visual experiences. They are employed to help individuals cope with their feelings and treat [[post-traumatic stress disorder]].

Creative peacebuilding through the visual arts is a process that facilitates the establishments of sustainable peace by preventing recurrence of violence, addresses the root causes, healing and effects of conflict, and offer alternatives to violence through reconciliation, economic and social transformation with the use of photography, film, painting, and the like. [[Jolyon Mitchell]] argues that the visual arts can both encourage peacebuilding and instigating violence. This is true of various forms of visual arts, ranging from posters, cartoons, and stained glass, to websites, radio, and films by reflecting on examples from around the world.{{sfn|Mitchell|2012}}{{page needed|date=November 2017}}

=== Photography ===
[[Photography]] is the science and art of creating durable images with light or other electromagnetic radiation, either through the use of an image sensor or chemical means of a light-sensitive. Susan Sontag opines that a photographer has the ability to create a reality by examining pictures.{{sfn|Sontag|2001}}{{page needed|date=November 2017}} Photography is one of the forms of [[new media]] that changes perceptions and changes the structure of society. The objectivity and subjectivity of a photograph is sometimes problematic. Sontag argues, "To photograph is to appropriate the thing photographed. It means putting one's self into a certain relation to the world that feels like knowledge, and therefore like power."{{sfn|Sontag|2001}}{{page needed|date=November 2017}} Photographers decide what to photograph, what elements to exclude, and what angle to frame the photo, and these factors may reflect a particular socio-historical context.

Along these lines, it can be argued that photography is a subjective form of representation. The visual quality of photographic images is particularly effective in grabbing, maintaining, and retaining viewers' attention. It is commonly stated that [[a picture is worth a thousand words]]. In the context of creative peacebuilding, the visual qualities of photographic images provide specific benefits. The power of an image to establish an objective work is the sole judge of the message the viewer's read. Subjective truth makes it an effective tool for peacebuilding. Images span generations, languages, and cultural differences. Different people can easily engage with the characters or situations presented to them, regardless of their background. Pictures are both cognitively and emotionally compelling – a process that is essential to peacebuilding mechanism. The power of image is also condition by its design and purpose. Furthermore, photographic contents and images are employed to negotiate issues of the past in creative ways highlighting the incidents, experiences, emotions, and themes thus fostering alternative imagination of the future that will help to sustain peace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Bidey |first=Tim |date=31 December 2014 |title=Picturing Peace: Using Photography in Conflict Transformation |url=https://www.peaceinsight.org/blog/2014/12/photography-conflict-transformation-balkans/ |website=Peace Insight |publisher=Peace Direct |access-date=10 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Photography promotes freedom of participation, access, and engagement, which is within the control of the viewer, and also opens up process for peacebuilding. At their discretion and their pace, the viewer engages and reflects on their experiences, while seeing and dwelling in the experience of others. Such an experience often creates the need to revisit the picture.

=== Websites ===
Jolyon Mitchell has written about how [[websites]] have been used as a medium for promoting peace on the screen. Through the web, the world has become a [[global village]]. Therefore, websites can be created to facilitate peacebuilding. It offers a virtual location whereby individuals can login, get information, take action, and post and share issues to aid in peacebuilding.{{sfn|Mitchell|2012|pp=189–215}}

'''''Desperate Remedies''''' is a 1993 New Zealand [[drama film]] directed by [[Stewart Main]] and [[Peter Wells (New Zealand)|Peter Wells]]. It was screened in the [[Un Certain Regard]] section at the [[1993 Cannes Film Festival]].&lt;ref name="festival-cannes.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/2609/year/1993.html |title=Festival de Cannes: Desperate Remedies |accessdate=22 August 2009|work=festival-cannes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
Set in "Hope, New Britannia",  an overwrought nineteenth century New Zealand community seemingly on the edge of destruction, Dorothea Brooke (Ward-Lealand) is a shopkeeper and dress designer with a troubled past. She strives in vain to keep her feckless, [[opium]]-addicted sister Rose out of the clutches of her former lover, Fraser (Curtis). Dorothea is in a [[Lesbianism|lesbian]] relationship with Anne Cooper (Chappell) but tempted by newcomer and former [[Radicalism (historical)|radical]] Lawrence Hayes (Smith). MP and war profiteer William Poyser (Hurst) wants her business and property to shore up his tottering career, through marriage. Dorothea, Anne and Lawrence become enmeshed in a tortured triangle, resolved when Lawrence agrees to marry Rose for convenience and to get her away from Fraser. Rose dies ravaged from her opium addiction, although Lawrence and Fraser have fought a battle on board a vessel as passengers and both are missing, presumed dead. Dorothea has been coerced into accepting Poyser in marriage.

Two years pass and Fraser returns, as does Lawrence. At an opera, a ''[[Mise en abyme|mise-en-abyme]]'' version of Fraser's sudden death is replayed &amp;ndash; but the veiled female assailant turns out to be Anne, not Dorothea. Realising that Anne is her true love, Dorothea leaves Poyser to his fate, given the exposure of his financial mismanagement and gambling debts. Lawrence sees them off at the dock as they depart Hope, and Dorothea and Anne are last seen together at the vessel's helm, embracing and arm in arm.

==Cast==
* [[Jennifer Ward-Lealand]] as Dorothea Brook
* [[Kevin Smith (New Zealand actor)|Kevin Smith]] as Lawrence Hayes
* [[Lisa Chappell]] as Anne Cooper
* [[Cliff Curtis]] as Fraser
* [[Michael Hurst]] as Willam Poyser
* [[Kiri Mills]] as Rose
* [[Bridget Armstrong]] as Mary Anne
* [[Timothy Raby]] as Mr. Weedle
* [[Helen Steemson]] as Gnits
* [[Geeling Ng]] as Su Lim (as Geeling Ching)

==Production==
The film was shot on a relatively modest budget of $2 million. As a money saving device it was mostly shot in a shed on the Auckland harbour. To further save on costs the cast members each played multiple roles. By utilising Fuji stock for its excessive colour the film was able to make the most of it costuming and art direction to create visuals that far exceeded what was to be expected from its budget.&lt;ref name=nzonscreen1&gt;{{cite web|title=Desperate Remedies|url=http://www.nzonscreen.com/title/desperate-remedies-1993|publisher=nzonscreen.com|accessdate=5 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Release and reception==
''Desperate Remedies'' premiered at the Miami Film Festival to wide acclaim. It appeared at many festivals including [[Cannes Film Festival]], Kiev International Film Festival and the Turin Lesbian and Gay Film Festival. The film picked up many awards including Best Design and Best Film at Kiev and the Audience Prize in Turin. It was also well received in New Zealand, winning awards for Best Cinematography, Best Design and Best Costume Design at the 1994 New Zealand Film and Television Awards.&lt;ref name=nzonscreen2&gt;{{cite web|title=Desperate Remedies|url=http://www.nzonscreen.com/title/desperate-remedies-1993/background|publisher=nzonscreen.com|accessdate=5 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film also garnered critical acclaim in the US and United Kingdom with many high-profile publications giving it positive reviews. In the US ''[[The New York Times]]'' described the film as "gorgeous but silly" while the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' noted that "Wells and Main never stumble, and their film emerges as a glittery triumph". In the UK the film received glowing reviews from ''NME'' who described it as "gloriously overblown, shamelessly [[Camp (style)|camp]] and utterly wonderful" while ''[[The Sunday Times]]'' reviewed it as "Deliciously Dotty".&lt;ref name=nzonscreen2/&gt;

'''Dobrosav Milojević''' was born in Donje Štiplje near [[Jagodina]] in 1948. He is well-known living Serbian artist among the [[Naïve painters]]. Now, he lives and works in Donje Štiplje.

== Biography ==
The official start of his dealing with the naive art is since 1971, when he was admitted to the Museum of Naïve and Marginal Art in [[Jagodina]]. Since then, he is its constant member. In the last 40 years, he had a huge number of solo exhibitions in [[Serbia]] and around the world. He has a permanent exhibition of paintings in the Museum of Naive Art in Jagodina and his paintings can be seen in many galleries around the world: Museum of Naïve and Marginal Art, Gallery of Self-taught Artists in Trebnje, the Galleries in Sanski Most, Gallery of International Naïve Art (GINA)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ginagallery.com/Gallery/ShowArtistItems.asp?ArtistId=90 |title=Dobrosav´s paintings in Gallery of International Naïve Art (GINA) |publisher=Ginagallery.com |date= |accessdate=2012-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Tel Aviv]], Gallery of Naive Art in [[Kovačica (town)|Kovačica]],  Gallery of Primitive and Folk Art, San Francisco. He has won several awards and plaques for his work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.naiveart.rs/iz13.htm |title=About Dobrosav Milojević´s awards at the Museum of Naïve and Marginal Art in Jagodina |publisher=Naiveart.rs |date= |accessdate=2012-07-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100406084356/http://www.naiveart.rs/iz13.htm |archivedate=2010-04-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Art==
He was interested in painting since early boyhood. As a child of the village he found inspiration in motifs that are related to village and life in it. While he lived in the city he felt strong nostalgie for the village and happy childhood days. This resulted in many of vividly pictures that depicted a beautiful landscape of mountains around the [[Crni Vrh (Jagodina)]], the mountain that marked his life and which he finally returned. Among the many affirmative opinions about his painting, the most important are:

==History==
===Early era===
Film-making in Louisiana began in 1898 with the [[Biograph Company|American Mutoscope and Biograph Company]].&lt;ref name="timeline"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.louisianafilmmuseum.org/Louisiana_Filmography.html|title=Louisiana Filmography: 1898-1980|author=Louisiana Film Museum|accessdate=2012-02-28|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120323140558/http://www.louisianafilmmuseum.org/Louisiana_Filmography.html|archive-date=2012-03-23|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;   It has been the site of several notable productions over the years, the first of which was ''[[Tarzan of the Apes (film)|Tarzan of the Apes]]'', completed in 1918. Other earlier film productions include ''[[Jezebel]]'', ''[[A Streetcar Named Desire (1951 film)|A Streetcar Named Desire]]'', ''[[Easy Rider]]'', ''[[Live and Let Die (film)|Live and Let Die]]'', and ''[[The Big Easy (film)|The Big Easy]]''.&lt;ref name="fbtfilm"/&gt;

Louisiana has hosted a long list of major film and television stars over the years whose reputations and talents have likely played a role in the rise of state's film industry. Some of these actors and actresses include Bette Davis, Henry Fonda, Paul Newman, Marlon Brando, Denzel Washington, John Wayne, Clint Eastwood, Julia Roberts, Dennis Hopper, Cicely Tyson, Elvis Presley, Dennis Quaid, John Goodman, Jessica Lange, Richard Pryor, Jackie Gleason, James Spader, Dolly Parton, Susan Sarandon, Tommy Lee Jones, Kevin Costner, Tom Cruise, Alec Baldwin, Yul Brenner, David Niven, Jimmy Stewart, James Mason, Brad Pitt, Charles Bronson, and Daryl Hannah.&lt;ref name="background"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.louisianafilmmuseum.org/|title=Background on the Museum|publisher=Louisiana Film Museum|accessdate=2012-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern era===
In 2002, Louisiana passed unique{{citation-needed|date=June 2015}} tax incentives aimed at recruiting film and television productions to the state. By 2011, the state's skilled crew base had grown by over 400 percent, and since 2006 over 300 [[film]]s have been shot in Louisiana. The industry truly entered the national spotlight though when ''[[The Curious Case of Benjamin Button (film)|The Curious Case of Benjamin Button]]'' earned thirteen [[Academy Award|Oscar]] nominations, the most in 2009.&lt;ref name="about"/&gt;

In 2010, boosted by its film industry, Louisiana made its first appearance in [[Site Selection (magazine)|Site Selection Magazine]]’s Top Business Climate rankings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fbtfilm.com/site-selection-2010.aspx|title=Film industry helps Louisiana earn Top 10 state ranking|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011 Louisiana hosted more than 150 productions and about $1.3 billion of their combined $1.9 billion in budgets was spent in the state.&lt;ref name="2011record"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filmneworleans.org/2012/uncategorized/louisiana-film-industry-passes-billion-dollar-mark-in-record-setting-2011/|title=Louisiana Film Industry Passes Billion-Dollar Mark In Record-Setting 2011|author=Mike Scott|accessdate=2012-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tax incentives==
On July 1, 2002, the [[Louisiana Legislature]] enacted the Louisiana Motion Picture Tax Incentive Act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://revenue.louisiana.gov/publications/lsleb(2002).pdf | title=2002 Legislative Sessions Department of Revenue Enrolled Bills | date=2002 | accessdate=August 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This [[tax credit]] has two primary components. First, the Investor Tax Credit provides a 30% tax credit on qualified motion picture expenditures with no project or program cap. Second, the Labor Tax Credit provides a 5% credit for [[payroll]] expenditures on Louisiana residents.&lt;ref name="louisianaeconomicdevelopment.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.louisianaeconomicdevelopment.com/opportunities/incentives--programs/motion-picture-tax-credit.aspx|title=Motion Picture Industry Development Tax Credit|publisher=LED|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100123175417/http://www.louisianaeconomicdevelopment.com/opportunities/incentives--programs/motion-picture-tax-credit.aspx|archivedate=January 23, 2010|deadurl=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; This program not only encourages residents to film in Louisiana but also employ Louisiana residents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fbtfilm.com/film_incentives.aspx|title=Louisiana Film Incentive &amp; Tax Credit Program Information|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; To qualify for this program, [[filmmaker]]s must spend at least $300,000 in Louisiana.&lt;ref name="louisianaeconomicdevelopment.com"/&gt;

==Climate and scenery==
Louisiana's warm weather and diverse locations have appealed to film producers across the country considering that the [[subtropical climate]] makes filming possible year-round without interruptions.&lt;ref name="shreveport"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shreveportla.gov/pictures/pics.htm|title=Shreveport Film and Media Industry|author=Cedric B. Glover|accessdate=2012-02-28|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120224103832/http://www.shreveportla.gov/pictures/pics.htm|archive-date=2012-02-24|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="locations"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.louisianaentertainment.gov/film/content.cfm?id=87|title=Locations|author=Louisiana FILM|accessdate=2012-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The spring and fall months are considered ideal filming time, with October being the driest month.&lt;ref name="weather"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.louisianaentertainment.gov/film/content.cfm?id=111|title=Weather Patterns|author=Louisiana FILM|accessdate=2012-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; In terms of scenery, Louisiana offers [[swamp]]s and [[cypress]] trees, public and private college campuses, [[Antebellum architecture|antebellum plantations]], and urban environments. These diverse locations are often credited for Louisiana's ability to stand in as multiple settings such as [[Texas]], [[Colorado]], [[Utah]], [[Washington, DC]], and [[London]]. As [[Patrick Lussier]], director of [[Drive Angry]] 3D, commented in [[USA Today]], "The film industry wants to find places it can reinvent and make look like anything it needs. There's a lot of opportunity [to] do that in Louisiana."&lt;ref name="Lussier"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/movies/news/2010-08-03-louisianafilm03_CV_N.htm|title=Versatile Louisiana becomes 'L.A.

The term is a [[German language|German]] word which has come to be accepted in [[English language|English]] as a term in [[aesthetics]].

The term was first used by the German writer and [[philosopher]] [[Karl Friedrich Eusebius Trahndorff|K. F. E. Trahndorff]] in an essay in 1827.&lt;ref&gt;Trahndorff (1827), ''Ästhetik oder Lehre von Weltanschauung und Kunst''&lt;/ref&gt; The German [[opera]] composer [[Richard Wagner]] used the term in two 1849 essays, and the word has become particularly associated with his aesthetic ideals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.interlude.hk/front/richard-wagners-concept-of-the-gesamtkunstwerk/|title=Richard Wagner's Concept of the ‘Gesamtkunstwerk’|website=Interlude.hk|language=en-US|access-date=2016-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is unclear whether Wagner knew of Trahndorff's essay.

In the twentieth century, some writers applied the term to some forms of architecture, while others have applied it to film and mass media.&lt;ref name="film"&gt;For discussions of architecture as Gesamtkunstwerk, see the relevant section of this article.

==Before Wagner==
Some elements of opera reform, seeking a more "classical" formula, had begun at the end of the 18th century. After the lengthy domination of [[opera seria]], and the ''[[da capo aria]]'', a movement began to advance the [[Libretto|librettist]] and the composer in relation to the singers, and to return the drama to a more intense and less moralistic focus. This movement, "reform opera" is primarily associated with [[Christoph Willibald Gluck]] and [[Ranieri de' Calzabigi]]. The themes in the operas produced by Gluck's collaborations with Calzabigi continue throughout the operas of [[Carl Maria von Weber]], until Wagner, rejecting both the Italian ''[[bel canto]]'' tradition and the [[French opera|French]] "spectacle opera", developed his union of music, drama, theatrical effects, and occasionally dance.

However these trends had developed fortuitously, rather than in response to a specific philosophy of art; Wagner, who recognised the reforms of Gluck and admired the works of Weber, wished to consolidate his view, originally, as part of his radical social and political views of the late 1840s. Previous to Wagner, others who had expressed ideas about union of the arts, which was a familiar topic among German [[Romanticism|Romantics]], as evidenced by the title of Trahndorff's essay, in which the word first occurred, "Aesthetics, or Theory of Philosophy of Art". Others who wrote on syntheses of the arts included [[Gottfried Lessing]], [[Ludwig Tieck]] and [[Novalis]].&lt;ref&gt;Millington (n.d.)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Carl Maria von Weber]]'s enthusiastic review of [[E.T.A. Hoffmann]]'s opera ''[[Undine (Hoffmann)|Undine]]'' (1816) admired it  as 'an art work complete in itself, in which partial contributions of the related and collaborating arts blend together, disappear, and, in disappearing, somehow form a new world'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Strunk|first=Oliver|title=Source Readings in Music History: The Romantic Era|year=1965|place=New York|pages=63|url=http://www.goldsmiths.ac.uk/aurifex/issue1/castein.html|accessdate=2008-05-10|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050502044016/http://www.goldsmiths.ac.uk/aurifex/issue1/castein.html|archivedate=2005-05-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Wagner's ideas==
Wagner used the exact term 'Gesamtkunstwerk' (which he spelt 'Gesammtkunstwerk') on only two occasions, in his 1849 essays "[[Art and Revolution]]" and "[[The Artwork of the Future]]",&lt;ref&gt;Wagner (1993), p. 35, where the word is translated as 'great united work'; p. 52 where it is translated as 'great unitarian Art-work'; and p. 88 (twice) where it is translated as 'great united Art-work'.&lt;/ref&gt; where he speaks of his ideal of unifying all works of art via the theatre.&lt;ref&gt;Warrack (n.d.), ''Gesamtkunstwerk'' is incorrect in saying that Wagner used the word only in "The Artwork of the Future"&lt;/ref&gt; He also used in these essays many similar expressions such as 'the consummate artwork of the future' and 'the integrated drama', and frequently referred to 'Gesamtkunst'.&lt;ref&gt;Millington (n.d.)&lt;/ref&gt; Such a work of art was to be the clearest and most profound expression of folk legend, though abstracted from its nationalist particulars to a universal humanist fable.

Wagner felt that the Greek tragedies of [[Aeschylus]] had been the finest (though still flawed) examples so far of total artistic synthesis, but that this synthesis had subsequently been corrupted by [[Euripides]]. Wagner felt that during the rest of human history up to the present day (i.e. 1850) the arts had drifted further and further apart, resulting in such "monstrosities" as [[Grand Opera]]. Wagner felt that such works celebrated bravura singing, sensational stage effects, and meaningless plots. In "Art and Revolution" Wagner applies the term 'Gesamtkunstwerk' in the context of Greek tragedy. In "The Art-Work of the Future" he uses it to apply to his own, as yet unrealised, ideal.

In his extensive book ''[[Opera and Drama]]'' (completed in 1851) he takes these ideas further, describing in detail his idea of the union of opera and drama (later called ''music drama'' despite Wagner's disapproval of the term), in which the individual arts are subordinated to a common purpose.

Wagner's own opera cycle ''[[Der Ring des Nibelungen]]'', and specifically its components ''[[Das Rheingold]]'' and ''[[Die Walküre]]'' represent perhaps the closest he, or anyone else, came to realising these ideals;&lt;ref&gt;Grey (2008) 86&lt;/ref&gt; he was himself after this stage to relax his own [[wikt:stricture|strictures]] and write more 'operatically'.&lt;ref&gt;Millington (1992) 294–95&lt;/ref&gt;

==In architecture==
Some architectural writers have used the term ''Gesamtkunstwerk'' to signify circumstances where an architect is responsible for the design and/or overseeing of the building's totality: shell, accessories, furnishings, and landscape.&lt;ref&gt;Michael A. Vidalis, "Gesamtkunstwerk – 'total work of art'", ''Architectural Review'', June 30, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; It is difficult to make a claim for when the notion of the ''Gesamtkunstwerk'' was first employed from the point of view of a building and its contents (although the term itself was not used in this context until the late 20th century); already during the Renaissance, artists such as [[Michelangelo]] saw no strict division in their tasks between architecture, interior design, sculpture, painting and even engineering. 
It has been argued by historian  Robert L. Delevoy that Art Nouveau represented an essentially decorative trend that thus lent itself to the idea of the architectural ''Gesamtkunstwerk''. But it is equally possible it was born from social theories that arose out of a fear of the rise of industrialism.&lt;ref&gt;Robert L. Delevoy, 'Art Nouveau', in ''Encyclopaedia of Modern Architecture''. Thames &amp; Hudson, 1977.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:RobieHouseWindows ChicagoIL.jpg|thumb| [[Frank Lloyd Wright]]: Interior of the Robie House, Chicago, 1909.]]

However evidence of complete interiors that typify the concept of ''Gesamtkunstwerk'' can be seen some time before the 1890s. There was an increasing trend amongst architects in the 18th and 19th centuries to control every facet of an architectural commission. As well as being responsible for the structure they tried to extend their role to include designing (or at least vetting) every aspect of the interior work as well. This included not only the interior architectural features but was extended to the design&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://gwerk.westbankcorp.com/|title=Home - GESAMTKUNSTWERK|website=GESAMTKUNSTWERK|language=en-US|access-date=2017-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; of furniture, carpets, wallpaper, fabrics, light fixtures and door-handles. [[Robert Adam]] and [[Augustus Welby Pugin]] are examples of this trend to create an over-all harmonising effect which in some cases might even extend to the choice or design of table silver, china and glassware.
 
A distinctly modern approach to the concept of architectural ''Gesamtkunstwerk'' emerged with the [[Bauhaus]] school, first established in [[Weimar]] in 1919 by [[Walter Gropius]]. The school specialised in design, art and craftsmanship (architecture was not introduced as a separate course until 1927 after it had transferred to [[Dessau]]). Gropius contended that artists and architects should also be craftsmen, that they should have experience working with different materials and artistic mediums, including industrial design, clothes design and theatre and music. However, Gropius did not necessarily see a building and every aspect of its design as being the work of a single hand.&lt;ref&gt;Arnold Wittick, ''Encyclopaedia of Modern Architecture''. Thames &amp; Hudson, 1977.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term '''''heteroglossia''''' describes the coexistence of distinct [[Variety (linguistics)|varieties]] within a single "[[Language#Linguistic diversity|language]]" (in Greek: ''hetero-'' "different" and ''glōssa'' "tongue, language"). In this way the term translates the [[Russian language|Russian]] разноречие [''raznorechie''], which was introduced by the Russian linguist [[Mikhail Bakhtin]] in his 1934 paper ''Слово в романе'' [Slovo v romane], published in [[English language|English]] as "Discourse in the Novel."

Bakhtin argues that the power of the novel originates in the coexistence of, and conflict between, different types of speech: the speech of characters, the speech of narrators, and even the speech of the author. He defines heteroglossia as "another's speech in another's language, serving to express authorial intentions but in a refracted way"(1934). Bakhtin identifies the direct narrative of the author, rather than dialogue between characters, as the primary location of this conflict.

==Languages as points of view==
Bakhtin viewed the modern [[novel]] as a literary form best suited for the exploitation of heteroglossia, in direct contrast to epic [[poetry]] (and, in a lesser degree, poetry in general). The linguistic energy of the novel was seen in its expression of the conflict between voices through their description to different elements in the novel's discourse.

Any language, in Bakhtin's view, stratifies into many voices: "social dialects, characteristic group behaviour, professional jargons, generic languages, languages of generations and age groups, tendentious languages, languages of the authorities, of various circles and of passing fashions".  This diversity of voice is, Bakhtin asserts, the defining characteristic of the novel as a genre.

Traditional stylistics, like epic poetry, do not share the trait of heteroglossia. In Bakhtin's words, "poetry depersonalizes 'days' in language, while prose, as we shall see, often deliberately intensifies difference between them..."

Extending his argument, Bakhtin proposes that all languages represent a distinct point of view on the world, characterized by its own meaning and values. In this view, language is "shot through with intentions and accents" (1981: 324), and thus there are no neutral words. Even the most unremarkable statement possesses a taste, whether of a profession, a party, a generation, a place or a time. To Bakhtin, words do not exist until they are spoken, and that moment they are printed with the signature of the speaker.

Bakhtin identifies the act of speech, or of writing, as a literary-verbal performance, one that requires speakers or authors to take a position, even if only by choosing the dialect in which they will speak. Separate languages are often identified with separate circumstances. Bakhtin gives an example of an illiterate peasant, who speaks [[Church Slavonic]] to [[God]], speaks to his family in their own peculiar dialect, sings songs in yet a third, and attempts to emulate officious high-class dialect when he dictates petitions to the local government. The prose writer, Bakhtin argues, must welcome and incorporate these many languages into his work.

==The hybrid utterance==

The hybrid utterance, as defined by Bakhtin, is a passage that employs only a single speaker—the author, for example—but one or more kinds of speech. The juxtaposition of the two different speeches brings with it a contradiction and conflict in belief systems.

In examination of the English comic novel, particularly the works of [[Charles Dickens]], Bakhtin identifies examples of his argument. Dickens parodies both the 'common tongue' and the language of Parliament or high-class banquets, using concealed languages to create humor. In one passage, Dickens shifts from his authorial narrative voice into a formalized, almost epic tone while describing the work of an unremarkable bureaucrat; his intent is to parody the self-importance and vainglory of the bureaucrat's position. The use of concealed speech, without formal markers of a speaker change, is what allows the parody to work. It is, in Bakhtin's parlance, a hybrid utterance. In this instance the conflict is between the factual narrative and the biting hyperbole of the new, epic/formalistic tone.

Bakhtin goes on to discuss the interconnectedness of conversation. Even a simple dialogue, in his view, is full of quotations and references, often to a general "everyone says" or "I heard that.." Opinion and information are transmitted by way of reference to an indefinite, general source. By way of these references, humans selectively assimilate the discourse of others and make it their own.

Bakhtin identifies a specific type of discourse, the "authoritative discourse," which demands to be assimilated by the reader or listener; examples might be religious dogma, or scientific theory, or a popular book. This type of discourse is viewed as past, finished, hierarchically superior, and therefore demands "unconditional allegiance" rather than accepting interpretation. Because of this, Bakhtin states that authoritative discourse plays an insignificant role in the novel. Because it is not open to interpretation, it cannot enter into hybrid utterance.

Bakhtin concludes by arguing that the role of the novel is to draw the authoritative into question, and to allow what was once considered certain to be debated and open to interpretation. In effect, novels not only function through heteroglossia, but must promote it; to do otherwise is an artistic failure.

==Influence of the concept==
Bakhtin's view of heteroglossia has been often employed in the context of the [[postmodernism|postmodern]] critique of the perceived teleological and authoritarian character of modernist art and culture. In particular, the latter's strong disdain for popular forms of art and literature—archetypically expressed in [[Theodor Adorno|Adorno]] and [[Max Horkheimer|Horkheimer]]'s analysis of the [[culture industry]]—has been criticised as a proponent of ''monoglossia''; practitioners of [[cultural studies]] have used Bakhtin's conceptual framework to theorise the critical reappropriation of mass-produced entertainment forms by the public.

The '''Hinton St Mary Mosaic''' is a large, almost complete [[Roman mosaic]] discovered at [[Hinton St Mary]], [[Dorset]], [[England]]. It appears to feature a [[portrait]] [[Bust (sculpture)|bust]] of [[Jesus|Jesus Christ]] as its central [[Motif (visual arts)|motif]].  The mosaic was chosen as Object 44 in the [[BBC Radio 4]] programme ''[[A History of the World in 100 Objects]]'', presented by [[British Museum]] director [[Neil MacGregor]].

The mosaic covered two rooms, joined by a small decorated threshold. It is largely red, yellow and cream in colouring. On stylistic grounds it has been dated to the 4th century and is attributed to the mosaic workshop of [[Durnovaria]] (modern [[Dorchester, Dorset|Dorchester]]). It is currently in storage at the [[British Museum]], although the central medallion is on display there.

==Christian panel==
[[File:Roundel mosaic christ hinton st mary british museum edit.JPG|thumb|right|Detail of central roundel mosaic]]
The panel in the larger room is {{convert|17|by|15|ft}}. A central circle surrounds a portrait bust of a man in a white [[pallium]] standing before a [[Christian]] [[Labarum|chi-rho]] symbol flanked by two [[pomegranate]]s. He is generally identified as Christ, although the [[Roman Emperor|Emperor]] [[Constantine I]] has also been suggested.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Moorhead|first1=Sam|last2=Stuttard|first2=David|title=The Romans who Shaped Britain|publisher=Thames &amp; Hudson|year=2012|page=203|isbn=978-0-500-25189-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is much evidence to lead to the identification of this as Christ, not least the absence of any insignia or identifiers pointing to a particular emperor. On each side of this are four [[lunette]]s, each featuring conventional forest and [[hunting]] vignettes, mostly of a dog and a deer. In the corners are four quarter circles containing portrait busts, either representing the [[Anemoi|winds]] or the [[season]]s.

==Pagan panel==
The panel in the smaller room is {{convert|16+1/2|by|8|ft}}. It consists of a central circle containing an image of characters from [[Roman mythology]], [[Bellerophon]] killing the [[Chimera (mythology)|Chimera]]. This has been interpreted in a more Christian context as representing good defeating evil. Flanking this are two rectangular panels again featuring dogs hunting deer.

==Context==
The mosaic was discovered on 12 September 1963 by the local [[blacksmith]], Walter John White.{{sfn|Toynbee|1964|p=7}} It was cleared by the [[Dorset County Museum]]{{sfn|Toynbee|1964|p=7}} and lifted for preservation by the [[British Museum]],{{sfn|Painter|1967|pp=21–22}} although none of the rest of the building has been examined. It is generally assumed to have been a [[Roman villa|villa]]. The layout of the mosaic room certainly resembles a Roman ''[[triclinium]]'', or dining room. However, it might easily be a [[Church (building)|church]] or other Christian complex. There were no finds dated earlier than {{circa|270}}.

'''Jewish paper cutting''' is a traditional form of [[Jewish]] [[folk art]] made by cutting figures and sentences in paper or [[parchment]]. 
It is connected with various customs and ceremonies, and associated with holidays and family life. Paper cuts often decorated [[Ketubah|ketubbot]] (marriage contracts), [[Mizrah]]s, and ornaments for festive occasions.  Paper cutting was practiced by Jewish communities in both Eastern Europe and North Africa and the Middle East for centuries and has seen a revival in modern times in Israel and elsewhere.

== History ==
[[File:Swiat. Agata Szepe 2011.jpg|thumb|right|Jewish papercut "The World" &lt;br/&gt;by Agata Szepe]]

=== Origins ===
The origin of Jewish paper cutting is unclear. [[Ashkenazi Jews]] in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries practiced this type of art. However, Jewish paper cuts can be traced to Jewish communities in Syria, Iraq, and North Africa, and the similarity in the cutting techniques (using a knife) between East European Jews and [[Chinese paper cutting|Chinese paper cutters]], may indicate that the origin goes back even further. Some contend that Ashkenazi paper-cutting may date to the 14th century, though its popularity reached a zenith in the 18th and 19th centuries.

The first mention of Jewish paper cutting can be found in the treatise "The fight of the pen and the scissors” by a 14th-century rabbi, Shem Tov ben Isaac ben Ardutiel (1290-1369), who describes how he decided to cut letters in paper when his ink became frozen during a harsh winter. To students of Christian Spanish literary history, Rabbi Shem Tov is known as Santob de Carrion de los Condes, the courtly [[Castilian people|Castilian]] troubadour who composed the Proverbios morales for Pedro the Cruel.&lt;ref name=MyJewishLearning-JewishPapercutting&gt;{{cite web|last1=Shadur |first1=Joseph |title=Jewish Papercutting: Folk art even the poorest folk could create |url=http://www.myjewishlearning.com/culture/2/Art/History_and_Theory/Jewish_Folk_Art/Jewish_Papercuts.shtml?p=0 |website=My Jewish Learning |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150107002727/http://www.myjewishlearning.com/culture/2/Art/History_and_Theory/Jewish_Folk_Art/Jewish_Papercuts.shtml?p=0 |archivedate=2015-01-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Paper cutting as a folk craft gained popularity in the nineteenth century when paper became a cheap material.&lt;ref name=ZygmuntFrankel-1&gt;{{cite web|last=Frankel|first=Giza|title=The Art of the Jewish Papercut |url=http://www.zygmuntfrankel.com/jewishpapercut.html |work=ZygmuntFrankel.com |publisher=Etcetera Editions|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Paper cutting was widespread among the [[Jews of Poland]] and [[Jews of Russia|Russia]] in the nineteenth century and the early years of the twentieth century. Jewish paper cuts were also produced in Germany and probably in the Netherlands. Some [[Jews of Italy|Italian Jewish]] [[parchment]] ketubot (marriage contracts) from the late 17th century until the nineteenth century were decorated paper cuts as well as some elaborate scrolls of the [[Book of Esther]]. Similar paper cuttings from Jewish communities North Africa and the Middle East have some characteristic style differences.

It was popular among Jews both in eastern and western Europe as well as in Turkey, Morocco, Syria, Bangladesh, Israel, and North America.&lt;ref name=Wycinanka-zydowska&gt;{{cite book|last=Gołąb|first=Marta|title=Jewish paper-cut = Wycinanka żydowska|year=2006|publisher=Wydawnictwo "Hagada"|location=Kraków|isbn=9788391507605}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In North Africa and the Middle East paper cuts were called a "Menorah", because one or more [[Menorah (Temple)|menorah]], always appeared as the central motif. These paper cuts included many inscriptions, mostly on the arms of the candelabras. The paper was mounted on thin, colored metal sheets. Two distinct kinds were produced: a Mizrah and smaller paper cuts used as charms. The motifs are the same as in European Jewish paper cuts but they have a distinctive Eastern style. Also, the [[hamsa]] ("the five-finger hand"), unknown in Europe, very often appears on these paper cuts.

=== Disappearance ===
Jewish paper cutting began disappearing in the first half of the twentieth century, mainly because of the rapid assimilation trends and the waning of many traditional practices, and was practiced only by older people who remembered this art form from their youth. Many paper cuts collections that had been preserved were destroyed during [[World War II]] and [[the Holocaust]] and relatively few remain in public or private collections.

=== Resurgence ===
Since the late twentieth century, Jewish paper cuts have again become a popular art form in both [[Israel]] and other countries. Paper cutting is again often used to decorate [[ketubot]], wedding invitations, and works of art. To a limited extent, Jewish paper cuts have become more popular in Poland as a result of the [[Jewish Culture Festival in Kraków]], a festival that has been held in [[Kraków]] since the 1990s.

[[Beit Hatefutsot]] – The Museum of the Jewish People in [[Tel Aviv, Israel]] presented a 2009 exhibition called "The Revival of Jewish Papercuts: Jewish paper cut art" in October 2009. The exhibit was curated by Prof. Olga Goldberg, Gabriella Rabbi, Rina Biran, the Giza Frenkel Papercut Archive, the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]]. Additionally, a [[National Science Foundation]]-funded study called “Tradition and Continuity in Jewish Papercuts” was conducted by Prof. Olga Goldberg.&lt;ref name=BeitHatfutsot-exhibition&gt;{{cite web|title=The Revival of Jewish Papercuts: Jewish paper cut art|url=http://www.bh.org.il/event/revival-jewish-papercuts/|publisher=The Museum of the Jewish People at Beit Hatfutsot |location=Tel Aviv, Israel|date=October 1, 2009 – January 31, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Artist Oren Loloi writes that the art of Jewish papercutting's resurgence is due in large part to the efforts of Polish-Jewish anthropologist and ethnologist Giza Frankel (see below).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Loloi|first1=Oren|title=What is Jewish paper-cutting?|url=https://www.papercutsbyoren.com/jewish-papercutting/|website=Paper Cuts by Oren|accessdate=14 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [http://www.worldcat.org/title/migzerot-neyar-omanut-yehudit-amamit/oclc/27227163 Frankel's 1983 book], ''The Art of the Jewish Papercut'' (Migzerot neyar: omanut Yehudit amamit), was produced after 50 years of painstaking research. 

Today, Jewish papercut art has grown in popularity beyond ritual items to art and expressions of Jewish faith, not only in Israel but worldwide. Loloi contends that the resurgence in papercutting's popularity is in part due to its contemporary near-ubiquity as part of the [[ketubah]] (marriage contract), which is a contemporary site of ''hiddur mitzvah'', the Jewish principle of honouring the Divine by beautifying ritual objects. Contemporary papercutting art may also be seen in amulets like [[Hamsa|hamsas]], [[Birkat HaBayit|blessings for the home]], [[Mizrah#Mizrah_in_Jewish_homes|mizrahim]], and other art pieces, usually as a wall plaque.

== Uses ==
[[Image:Mizrah.jpg|thumb|right|300 pxs|''Mizrah'' papercut, [[Eastern Europe]], 19th century]]

=== Types ===
Depending on their purpose, shape and connection with specific religious and non-religious events, paper cuts are of different types.&lt;ref name=Wycinanka-zydowska-w-Polsce&gt;{{cite book|last=Fränklowa|first=Giza|title=Wycinanka zydowska w Polsce: (Papierschnitte bei den Juden in Polen)|year=1929 |publisher=Nakł Towarzystwa Ludoznawczego |location=Lwów |url=http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/10628388|language=Polish}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|40–57}}

A Mizrah (hebr. The East) is a plaque hung on the east wall of private houses to show the direction of Jerusalem. A shivis’i (hebr. always) is similar to a mizrah, but it hangs on the east side of a synagogue. Its name is connected with a sentence from the Bible: 'Shivis'i adonai l'negdi tamid' ('I have set the LORD always before me').&lt;ref name=Wycinanka-zydowska-w-Polsce /&gt;{{rp|4}} Shivis’i in the form of paper cuts rather than some more durable material were only used in poor synagogues.

There were also various paper cuts made for special, religious celebrations. Shevuoslekh ("little Shavuots") and ''royzelekh'' (rosettes) decorated windows for [[Shavuot]]. Royzelekh are circle-shaped paper cuts, while Shevuoslekh are rectangular. They were often made by pupils in elementary Jewish religious schools ([[Cheder]]s). They were sometimes decorated with motifs unconnected to religion, such as soldiers or riders.

Flags for [[Simchat Torah|Simchat-Torah]] were also made by ''cheder'' pupils. Created from colourful paper, each paper cut symbolized one of the twelve tribes of Israel. The other side of the paper showed an image of Torah with moving doors cut in paper. Paper cuts made for Sukkot were formed into lanterns, chains and birds, hung in [[Sukkah]]s.

Paper cuts often decorated a plaque with a prayer called Ushpizin, made for Sukkot. Paper cuts were also created for Purim, often containing the Hebrew sentence: ”Mishenekhnas adar marbin b’simcha’ (‘We should rejoice because (the month of) Adar begins') and cut into an image of a bottle and glasses, a symbol of rejoicing.&lt;ref name=Wycinanka-zydowska-w-Polsce /&gt;{{rp|11}}

Papercutting also has connections with other forms of Jewish tradition. For example, [[Ketubah]]s (marriage agreements) were sometimes prepared in the form of paper cut, or decorated with paper cutting elements. Also cut into paper, memorial plaques were made to commemorate the names of ancestors’ names and dates of birth and death. Lanterns with papercut walls were placed in synagogues for anniversaries of great men’s death.&lt;ref name=Wycinanka-zydowska-w-Polsce /&gt;{{rp|10–11}} Amulets like a [[Hamsa]] often showed an image of a palm with an eye on it.

== Characteristics ==

=== Features ===
Paper cuts traditionally were created with the use of shoemaker’s knife. It is likely that most artists were men, though in later years, schoolgirls (and boys) made little rosettes (called ''royzelekh'' or ''reyzelekh'' in [[Yiddish]]) with scissors, to decorate their notebooks or for holiday decorations in the home.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Michlic|first1=Joanna Beata|title=Toys and Games|url=http://www.yivoencyclopedia.org/article.aspx/Toys_and_Games|website=YIVO Encyclopedia of Jews in Eastern Europe|accessdate=14 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The artist first drew the pattern on a paper or parchment, and then cut it. Sometimes, they painted their work in watercolors. Paper cuts were usually glued to a contrasting background in a specific way, to bring the cut paper into relief. Hebrew sentences were important element of the composition. The words were either cut or drawn on paper. Elements of [[micrography]], another traditional type of Jewish folk art, can be seen in these blocks of text created with the artist's knife. Due to [[Aniconism in Judaism|Judaism's aniconism]], it is rare to see a paper-cut from this period that depicts the human figure. Exceptions are Sephardic [[Ketubot]] depicting the bride and bridegroom.&lt;ref name="Wycinanka-zydowska" /&gt;

=== Styles ===
Traditionally, paper cuts made by [[Sephardic]] and Ashkenazi Jews differed from each other. Ashkenazi papercuts were rich, highly detailed, and colourful. In this style, artists tried to fill the free space with as many elements as is possible. By contrast, the Sephardic compositions were more minimalist, including motifs such as the menorah, columns, [[Arabesque|arabesques]] and lanterns.&lt;ref name="Wycinanka-zydowska" /&gt; Modern Jewish paper cut art is done in many styles and is not limited to the aforementioned symbols and motifs. They may be single-layered or multi-layered.

=== Symbols ===
Every element of Jewish paper cut has its own symbolism. Some are typical of general Jewish culture, others are peculiar to the art of paper cutting. The most important symbols are placed along the [[axis of symmetry]].

The main symbols are usually a [[Torah]] or a [[Menorah (Temple)|Menorah]]:
* The image of the Torah symbolizes God’s law, Judaism, Israel. The [[Star of David]] symbolizes Judaism and Israel
* The Menorah symbolizes Israel, Judaism, and [[Temple in Jerusalem]]. The middle flame is a symbol of ‘[[Shekinah]]’ (Hebrew for God’s presence); the other flames are shown as leaning towards the main flame. The bottom of the menorah is often shown as a complicated ornament symbolizing [[infinity]]

A range of animals are depicted in paper cuts:
* [[Lions]], a biblical symbol of the [[Tribe of Judah]], are associated with strength, bravery, power&lt;ref name=Litin-KehilaLinks&gt;{{cite web|title="Mizrah" Papercut for a Succah - Litin, Ukraine - 1858|url=http://kehilalinks.jewishgen.org/litin/papercut.html|work=Litin, Ukraine|publisher=JewishGen|format=KehilaLinks}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* [[Deer]] symbolize the [[Tribe of Naphtali]]&lt;ref name=Wycinanka-zydowska-w-Polsce /&gt;{{rp|6}}&lt;ref name=Shivtei-Yisrael&gt;{{cite web|last=Mael|first=Rabbi Fishel|title=Characteristics of the Tribe of Naphtali|url=http://www.britam.org/mael/Mael13Naphtali.html|work=Shivtei Yisrael|publisher=Brit-Am}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Birds]] are associated with the human soul 
* [[Fish]] are usually connected with fertility
* A [[squirrel]] biting a nut symbolizes the effort put into reading the Torah
* The Four Animals (a [[leopard]], an [[eagle]], a [[gazelle]], and a [[lion]]) are connected with a sentence from [[Pirkei Avot]]: “Be strong as the leopard, swift as the eagle, fleet as the gazelle, and brave as the lion to do the will of your Father in Heaven”&lt;ref name=Mishnah-Pirkei-Avot&gt;{{cite web|title=Mishnah Pirkei Avot|url=http://www.shechem.org/torah/avot.html#chap5|work=Ethics Of The Fathers|location=Chapter 5, Number 23|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927190001/http://www.shechem.org/torah/avot.html#chap5|archivedate=2007-09-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* A [[snake eating its own tail]] symbolizes [[infinity]]&lt;ref name="Wycinanka-zydowska" /&gt;

Papercut flora is usually connected with the biblical [[Tree of Life]],&lt;ref name=Wycinanka-zydowska-w-Polsce /&gt;{{rp|6}} with some of the plants having their specific symbolism. For example, [[vine]] was associated with the land of Israel and with fertility, [[pomegranates]] symbolized fertility, etc.

Others symbols were connected both with tradition and with everyday life:
* [[Signs of the Zodiac]] showed the sequence of Jewish celebrations during the year
* Often positioned above the Torah or a Menorah, the crown is a symbol of God, the Torah, the Kingdom of Israel or the Priesthood&lt;ref name=Wycinanka-zydowska-w-Polsce /&gt;{{rp|5}} 
* Columns and other [[wikt:architectonic|architectonic]] elements are associated with the Temple in Jerusalem
* Hands with joined thumbs are a gesture of blessing
* A jug filled with water and a bowl symbolize the [[Tribe of Levi]], blessing or the Priesthood

== Methodology ==
The images are created by cutting a design into a folded piece of paper. When the paper is unfolded, the symmetrical design is revealed.&lt;ref name=Bib-Arch-Shadur&gt;{{cite web|last=Shadur|first=Yehudit|title=How Yehudit Shadur Makes a Paper-Cut|url=http://members.bib-arch.org/publication.asp?PubID=BSBR&amp;Volume=2&amp;Issue=2&amp;ArticleID=14|work=BR (Bible Review)|date=Summer 1986}}&lt;/ref&gt; The paper can be cut using either scissors or a craft knife.

The story of the '''Knight of the Swan''', or '''Swan Knight''', is a [[Medieval poetry|medieval]] [[Epic poetry|tale]] about a mysterious rescuer who comes in a [[swan]]-drawn boat to defend a [[Damsel in distress|damsel]], his only condition being that he must never be asked his name.

The earliest versions (preserved in ''Dolopathos'') do not provide specific identity to this knight, but the Old French [[Crusade cycle]] of ''[[chansons de geste]]'' adopted it to make the Swan Knight (''Le Chevalier au Cigne'', first version around 1192) the legendary ancestor of [[Godfrey of Bouillon]]. The ''Chevalier au Cigne'', also known as '''Helias''', figures as the son of Orient of L'Islefort (or Illefort) and his wife Beatrix in perhaps the most familiar version, which is the one adopted for the late fourteenth century [[Middle English]] ''[[Chevalere Assigne|Cheuelere Assigne]]''.&lt;ref name=gibbs-i&gt;{{Harvnb|Gibbs|1868|pp=i-ii}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hero's mother's name may vary from Elioxe (probably a mere echo of Helias) to Beatrix depending on the text, and in a Spanish version, she is called Isomberte.

At a later time, the German poet [[Wolfram von Eschenbach]] incorporated the swan knight '''[[Lohengrin|Loherangrin]]''' into his [[Arthurian]] epic ''[[Parzival]]'' (first quarter of the 13th century). A German text, written by [[Konrad von Würzburg]] in 1257, also featured a Swan Knight without a name. Wolfram's and Konrad's were used to construct the libretto for [[Richard Wagner]]'s opera ''[[Lohengrin (opera)|Lohengrin]]'' (Weimar 1850).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Jaffray|1910|p=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another example of the motif is Brangemuer, the knight that lay dead in a boat tugged by a swan, and whose adventure was taken up by Gawain's brother Guerrehet ([[Gareth]] or [[Gaheris]]) in the first Continuation to [[Chrétien de Troyes]]' ''[[Perceval, the Story of the Grail|Perceval]]''.

==Swan Children==
The "Swan-Children" appears to have been originally separate from the Godfrey cycle and the Swan Knight story generally.&lt;ref name=Hibbard239/&gt; Paris identifies four groups of variants, which he classifies usually by the name of the mother of the swan children.
&lt;ref name=Hibbard240&gt;{{Harvnb|Hibbard|1963|p=240}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The tale in all variants resemble not only such [[chivalric romance]]s as ''[[The Man of Law's Tale]]'' and ''[[Emaré]]'', but such fairy tales as ''[[The Girl Without Hands]]''.{{r|schlauch}} It also bears resemblance to the fairy tale ''[[The Six Swans]]'', where brothers transformed into birds are rescued by the efforts of their sister.{{sfnp|Schlauch|1969|p=80}}

===Dolopathos===
Included in Johannes de Alta Silva's ''Dolopathos sive de Rege et Septem Sapientibus'' (ca. 1190), a Latin version of the ''[[Seven Sages of Rome]]'' is a story of the swan children which has served as a precursor to the poems of the [[Crusade cycle]].&lt;ref name=OFCC-Dolopathos&gt;{{Harvnb|Mickel|Nelson|1977}}, Myer's essay, p.lxxxxi-&lt;/ref&gt; The tale was adapted into the French ''Li romans de Dolopathos'' by the poet Herbert.&lt;ref name=gerritsen&gt;{{Harvnb|Gerritsen|Van Melle|1998}}, ''Dictionary of Medieval Heroes'', reprinted 2000, pp.247 "Seven Sages of Rome"&lt;/ref&gt; The story is as follows:&lt;ref name=OFCC-Dolopathos/&gt;&lt;ref name=Hibbard240-1&gt;{{Harvnb|Hibbard|1963|pp=240-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A nameless young lord becomes lost in the hunt for a [[white stag]] and wanders into an [[enchanted forest]] where he encounters a mysterious woman (clearly a [[swan maiden]] or [[fairy]]) in the act of bathing, while clutching a gold necklace. They fall instantly for each other and consummate their love. The young lord brings her to his castle, and the maiden (just as she has foretold) gives birth to a [[septuplet]], six boys and a girl, with golden chains about their necks. But her evil mother-in-law swaps the newborn with seven puppies. The servant with orders to kill the children in the forest just [[Child abandonment#In fiction|abandons]] them under a tree. The young lord is told by his wicked mother that his bride gave birth to a litter of pups, and he punishes her by burying her up to the neck for seven years.  Some time later, the young lord while hunting encounters the children in the forest, and the wicked mother's lie starts to unravel. The servant is sent out to search them, and find the boys bathing in the form of swans, with their sister guarding their gold chains. The servant steals the boys' chains, preventing them from changing back to human form, and the chains are taken to a goldsmith to be melted down to make a goblet. The swan-boys land in the young lord's pond, and their sister, who can still transform back and forth into human shape by the magic of her chain, goes to the castle to obtain bread to her brothers. Eventually the young lord asks her story so the truth comes out. The goldsmith was actually unable to melt down the chains, and had kept them for himself. These are now restored back to the six boys, and they regain their powers, except one, whose chain the smith had damaged in the attempt. So he alone is stuck in swan form. The work goes on to say obliquely hints that this is the swan in the Swan Knight tale, more precisely, that this was the swan “''quod cathena aurea militem in navicula trahat armatum'' (that tugged by a gold chain an armed knight in a boat).”&lt;ref name=OFCC-Dolopathos/&gt;

===Crusade cycle: ''La Naissance du Chevalier au Cygne''===
The Knight of the Swan story appears in the Old French ''[[chansons de geste]]'' of the first [[Crusade cycle]], establishing a legendary  ancestry of [[Godfrey of Bouillon]], who in 1099 became ruler of the [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]]. Godfrey loomed large in the medieval Christian imagination, and his shadowy genealogy became a popular subject for writers of the period.

The swan-children tale occurs in the first or ''La Naissance du Chevalier au Cygne'' branch of the [[Literary cycle|cycle]]. The texts can be classed into four versions, 1) ''Elioxe'', 2) ''Beatrix'', 3) an Elioxe-Beatrix composite, and 4) Isomberte.  Of ''Isomberte'' no French copy survives, and it's known only from the Spanish ''Gran conquista de Ultramar''.&lt;ref name="elioxe-intro-OFCC"/&gt;  
([[Gaston Paris]] also used a somewhat similar classification scheme for swan-children cognate tales which he refers to as Version I.&lt;ref name=Hibbard239 /&gt;)

[[File:Helias 2.gif|thumb|Helias, [[Duchy of Brabant|Brabant]] (16th-century)]]

'''Elioxe''' follows the ''Dolopathos'' tale closest, but tells a courtlier version of the story,&lt;ref name=elioxe-intro-OFCC&gt;{{Harvnb|Mickel|Nelson|1977}}, Myer's essay, p.xciii-&lt;/ref&gt; replacing the young lord who becomes lost with King Lothair, a ruler from beyond [[Hungary]] and the maiden with Elioxe. Lothair loses his way and stops by a fountain, and while asleep, is tended by Elioxe who comes out of the woodworks of the mountains. King Lothair decides to wed her, despite his mother's protest. However Elioxe foretells her own death giving birth to seven children, and that one of the offspring shall be king of the Orient.

While Lothair is absent warring, the queen mother Matrosilie orders a servant to carry the children in two baskets and expose them in the forest, and prepares the lie that their mother gave birth to serpents and died from their bites. The servant however had left the children by the hermit's hut, so they survive, and seven years later are discovered by a greedy courtier named Rudemart. Allured by the gold chains the children are wearing, he obtains instruction from the queen mother to steal them, but failing to take account of their numbers, misses the chain belonging to the girl. The six boys bereft of the chains fly out in swan form, and their father Lothair issues an order of protection. The king's nephew tries to hunt one of the birds to please him, but the king in a fit hurls a gold basin which breaks. Matrosilie then provides one of the necklaces to make the repair. Eventually the truth is untangled through the sister of the swan siblings. All the boys regain human form but one. While other seek their own fortunes, one boy cannot part with his brother turned permanently into a swan, and becomes Swan Knight.&lt;ref name=elioxe-intro-OFCC/&gt;

In the '''Beatrix''' variants, the woman had taunted another woman over her alleged adultery, citing a [[multiple birth]] as proof of it, and was then punished with a multiple birth of her own.&lt;ref name="hibbard242"&gt;{{Harvnb|Hibbard|1963|p=242}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Beatrix versions, the mother is also an avenging justice.{{sfnp|Schlauch|1969|p=80–1}} In the '''Isomberte''' variants, the woman is a princess fleeing a hated marriage.&lt;ref  name="hibbard242"/&gt;

==Swan Knight==
Version II involves the Swan Knight himself. These stories are sometimes attached to the story of the Swan Children, but sometimes appear independently, in which case no explanation of the swan is given. All of these describe a knight who appears with a swan and rescues a lady; he then disappears after a taboo is broken, but not before becoming the ancestor of an illustrious family.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hibbard|1963|p=244}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes this is merely a brief account to introduce a descendant.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hibbard|1963|p=245}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second version of this tale is thought to have been written by the [[Normans|Norman]] [[trouvère]] [[Jean Renart]].

In [[Duchy of Brabant|Brabant]] the name of the Knight of the Swan is ''Helias''. It has been suggested that this connects him to the Greek solar god, [[Helios]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hibbard|1963|p=248}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the name is in fact a common variant of the name of the prophet [[Elijah]], who nevertheless was connected to the Greek solar god by orthodox worship because of his association to Mount Horeb and a fire chariot.

[[File:Lohengrin-kitsch.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|Lohengrin postcard around 1900 by unknown artist]]

==Lohengrin==
{{main|Lohengrin}}
In the early 13th century, the German poet [[Wolfram von Eschenbach]] adapted the Swan Knight motif for his epic ''[[Parzival]]''. Here the story is attached to Loherangrin, the son of the protagonist Parzival and the queen of Pelapeire Condwiramurs. As in other versions Loherangrin is a knight who arrives in a swan-pulled boat to defend a lady, in this case Elsa of [[Duchy of Brabant|Brabant]]. They marry, but he must leave when she breaks the taboo of asking his name.

In the late 13th century, the poet Nouhusius (Nouhuwius) adapted and expanded Wolfram's brief story into the romance ''[[Lohengrin]]''. The poet changed the title character's name slightly and added various new elements to the story, tying the Grail and Swan Knight themes into the history of the [[Holy Roman Empire]].&lt;ref name="kalinke"/&gt; In the 15th century an anonymous poet again took up the story for the romance ''Lorengel''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kalinke|1991|pp=282–283}}&lt;/ref&gt; This version omits the taboo against asking about the hero's name and origins, allowing the knight and princess a happy ending.

In 1848, [[Richard Wagner]] adapted the tale into his popular [[opera]] ''[[Lohengrin (opera)|Lohengrin]]'', probably the work through which the Swan Knight story is best known today.&lt;ref&gt;Toner, Frederick L. (1991). "Richard Wagner". In Norris J. Lacy, ''The New Arthurian Encyclopedia'', pp. 502–505. New York: Garland. {{ISBN|0-8240-4377-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6094">The '''Kuryokhin Center''', or more extended the '''Sergey Kuryokhin Center for Modern Art''', is a [[non-profit]] [[cultural centre]] in [[Saint Petersburg]], [[Russia]].&lt;ref&gt;http://thisislike.com/kurehin-international-contemporary-art-centre-area/about&lt;/ref&gt; The centre was founded in 2004 and named after the Russian avant garde composer [[Sergey Kuryokhin]]. The main space of the centre has a capacity of 2000 people. The venue is located in an old cinema building.

==About Kuryokhin Center==
The Kuryokhin Center organises visual art exhibitions, art events and festivals. The Modern Art Center is an old cinema space. It hosts [[experimental music]], film and art festivals ([[Sergey Kuryokhin International Festival|SKIF]], [[Electro-mechanika Festival]], [[Videoforma festival]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.satellietgroep.nl/badgast_air_sea/1&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Ethno-mechanica Festival]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.waytorussia.net/events/saint-petersburg/sergey-kuryokhin-modern-art-center/ethno-mechanica-festival.html&lt;/ref&gt;) and a few other random events several times per year.

'''Magnor Glassworks ''' (''Magnor Glassverk AS'') is a glass company located in [[Eidskog]], in [[Hedmark]] county, [[Norway]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fjorn.com/magnor.html ''Magnor Glassware - Norway'' (Fjorn Scandinavian)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110223113706/http://fjorn.com/magnor.html |date=2011-02-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gonorway.com/norway/counties/hedmark/eidskog/76388b45b255415/index.html ''Eidskog'' (GoNorway)]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Eda glasbruk]] glassworks  factory was first founded in 1830 by Carl Christopher Lampa and Lars Wilhelm Ahlbom in [[Eda kommun]] in [[Värmland County]], Sweden. In 1842, new owners took over the glass factory and in 1862 moved  a site in [[Surte]], in [[Västra Götaland]] County, [[Sweden]]. A branch location, first known as Geijer Fors Glass Works, was started in 1896 at [[Magnor]], a village in the municipality of [[Eidskog]], in [[Hedmark]], Norway.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.edaglas.com/text1_6.html ''Glastillverkningen i Eda har en lång historia'' (Eda Glasbruk)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080515234108/http://www.edaglas.com/text1_6.html |date=2008-05-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Magnor Glassworks was established in a forested area near the border between Norway and Sweden. The large forests supplied fuel for the melting furnaces. While the operations on the Swedish side of the border has ceased, Magnor Glassworks is still in operation and produces tableware, vases and other art objects in glass. The company has manufactured [[glassware]] designed by Norwegian fashion designer [[Per Spook]] and Norwegian painter and artist [[Vebjørn Sand]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nrk.no/nyheter/distrikt/hedmark_og_oppland/glamdal/1.2360552|title=Ari-suksess for Magnor|last=Høsøien Indseth|first=Ingrid|date=2007-05-03|publisher=[[NRK]]|language=Norwegian|accessdate=13 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.magnor.no/per-spook.aspx ''Per Spook – The meeting of glass with style'' (Magnor Glassverk AS)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140310170100/http://www.magnor.no/per-spook.aspx |date=2014-03-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Monell Chemical Senses Center''' is a non-profit independent scientific institute located at the [[University City Science Center]] research campus in [[Philadelphia]], in the [[U.S. state]] of [[Pennsylvania]]. Monell conducts and publishes interdisciplinary basic research on [[taste]], [[Olfaction|smell]], and [[chemesthesis]] (chemically mediated skin senses, such as the burn of [[capsaicin]] or the tingle of carbonation). 

==Overview==
Founded in 1968, the center's mission is to advance knowledge of the mechanisms and functions of the chemical senses to benefit human health and well-being. Knowledge gained from Monell’s basic research provides insight and solutions for issues related to public health, national health policy, and quality of life, including studies of obesity, diabetes, hypertension, pediatric health, occupational safety, environmental interactions, and homeland security.

Monell has a scientific staff of more than 50 Ph.D.-level scientists, and provides research opportunities for local high school and undergraduate students. Situated in the academic heart of Philadelphia’s University City Science Center, the center occupies two buildings with a total of {{convert|80000|sqft|m2}}.  The institute is operated as a non-profit organization and receives funding from government grants, primarily from the National Institutes of Health through the National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders and the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, as well as from foundations and unrestricted corporate sponsorships.

==Leadership==
[[Robert Margolskee]] was appointed in 2014 as the center's third Director.  Dwight Riskey is Board Chair. Many eminent scientists, academicians and business executives have served the center as board members and members of advisory committees.

[[File:Three buffered mults - Today's completed builds... (2014-12-18 12.32.13 by c-g.).jpg|thumb|Custom built mult circuits and panels]]
A '''mult box''' is "a metal box with multiple outputs of a single audio source (one microphone connected to twenty jacks so that twenty people can record that microphone)."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.euonline.org/members/continui/audioendearment/index.html |publisher=NPR |first= Mark |last=Greenhouse |title=Audio Terms of Endearment |date= July 7, 2007 |accessdate=March 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; A mult box is sometimes called a '[[press box]]', but that term is usually reserved for the sports media's section of an arena. It may also be called a '''press mult box''' or '''press bridge'''.&lt;ref name=View&gt;{{cite web|url=http://garypalamara.com/Articles_Press%20Conference%202.htm|last=Palamara|first=Gary|publisher=Radio World|title=The View From the Back of the Room - II: Tips for Reporters and Others Covering Press Events|date=June 20, 2007|accessdate=May 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[sound engineer]] connects several [[microphone]]s to allow all of them to get clean, high-quality audio.&lt;ref name=View /&gt;

Reporters use a mult box frequently at [[press conference]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gearslutz.com/board/remote-possibilities-acoustic-music-location-recording/331423-mult-box-set-up-press-feed.html |title=Mult Box Set Up for Press Feed |date=September 29, 2008 |accessdate=March 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; especially when politicians give such interviews in small spaces, where not all the reporters in a [[press pool]] can access the interviewee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.yahoo.com/rick-santorums-way-win-run-campaign-shoestring-budget-162734670--abc-news.html |publisher=Yahoo News |authors=Shushanna Walsh and Michael Falcone |title=Rick Santorum's Way to Win? Run a Campaign on a Shoestring Budget |date=February 15, 2012 |accessdate=March 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rules==
A whole set of [[etiquette]] and [[mores]] has developed amongst [[journalist]]s governing the use of mult boxes.  Because it is often difficult to get a good [[sound recording]] from a [[Dictation machine|digital recorder]] for later broadcast or [[:wikt:transcribe|transcription]] for newspaper reporting, journalists have developed informal rules for their use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sportsjournalists.com/forum/index.php?topic=57499.0|author="Johnny Dangerously" ([[pseudonym]])|title=Mult box procedure and etiquette|publisher=[[Sportsjournalists.com]] |date=June 16, 2008|accessdate=May 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, the media should treat the sound engineer well, because while reporters can be selfish and competitive with each other, and the equipment can go wrong in many ways, the engineer allows all of them to get a good signal.&lt;ref name=View /&gt;  It is also extremely important to show up early to press conferences; this "early bird gets the worm" habit allows one to test equipment, to avoid problems caused by the chaos of most press conferences, and to work cooperatively with the engineer.&lt;ref name=View /&gt;

The [[NCAA]] has a specific, written policy on the use of mult boxes for all NCAA championships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://i.turner.ncaa.com/dr/ncaa/ncaa/release/sites/default/files/files/NewsMediaPress%20Conferences.pdf|author=unknown|title=NCAA Championship (News, Media and Press Conferences) |publisher=[[NCAA]]|year=2016|accessdate=Oct 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Availability==
[[United States]] government agencies usually provide a mult box for media use at press conferences.&lt;ref&gt;See ''e.g.'', http://www.ntsb.gov/news/2012/120323.html [[NTSB]] press release; accessed May 10, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, they are not always consistent; the [[United States Department of Energy]] sometimes makes a mult box available, but then does not make a "media avail with speakers"; yet at other times does ''not'' allow a mult box but follows it up with a "press availability".&lt;ref name=Energy&gt;{{cite web|url=http://energy.gov/articles/tomorrow-secretary-chu-visit-south-carolina-attend-small-business-summit-highlight-clean|publisher=United States Department of Energy|title=TOMORROW: Secretary Chu to Visit South Carolina to Attend Small Business Summit, Highlight Clean Energy Innovations With Rep. Clyburn (press release)|date=August 22, 2011|accessdate=May 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some state government agencies or courts also may provide such equipment for free to media, but charge a fee to rent it for private events held on state property.&lt;ref&gt;See, ''e.g.'', in [[Ohio]], [http://www.supremecourt.ohio.gov/PIO/MediaRequestInfo/default.asp [[Supreme Court of Ohio]]'s Guidelines for News Organizations Broadcasting, Televising, Recording and Photographing Sessions of Court], [http://www.ohiostatehouse.org/events/YourEvent/index.aspx Ohio Statehouse's webpage on "Your Event at the Statehouse"], and [http://www.ohiostatehouse.org/Communications/Media/UseOfTapeRecorders.aspx Ohio Statehouse's webpage on "Use of Tape Recorders at the Ohio Statehouse For News Media and Others"]; all accessed May 10, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some colleges and universities provide the use of a mult box ''gratis'' to media who need it to record large academic events such as [[Graduation|commencement]], speaker, or [[funeral]],&lt;ref&gt;See, ''e.g.'', [http://news.vanderbilt.edu/2012/05/commencement-events-may-10-11-at-vanderbilt-university/ [[Vanderbilt University]] press release], [http://www.cianewswire.com/2012/05/mediaalert_hfhk.html [[The Culinary Institute of America]] press release] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130310024625/http://www.cianewswire.com/2012/05/mediaalert_hfhk.html |date=2013-03-10 }}, and [http://www.vt.edu/in-memoriam/dec12-service.html [[Virginia Tech]] press information web page] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120805200257/http://www.vt.edu/in-memoriam/dec12-service.html |date=2012-08-05 }}; both accessed May 10, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; but charge for leasing to certain organizations.&lt;ref&gt;See, ''e.g.'', [http://www.css.washington.edu/Rental-List [[University of Washington]] Classroom Support Services "Rental List" web page] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100620195509/http://www.css.washington.edu/Rental-List |date=2010-06-20 }} and [http://www.css.washington.edu/Fee-Categories University of Washington web page listign which groups are charged what rates]; see also [http://www.nyu.edu/campusmedia/events/rates.html [[New York University]] web page for Events Media Services Rates] and [http://www.nyu.edu/campusmedia/events/policies.html New York University policies web page]; all accessed May 10, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;  Larger houses of worship, such as a [[basilica]] or [[cathedral]], may provide a mult box for certain religious services, but not others, depending on their policies and the nature of the [[Mass (liturgy)|mass]] or [[eucharist]].&lt;ref&gt;See, ''e.g.'', [http://archphila.org/press%20releases/pr001946.htm [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Philadelphia]] press release] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120703053610/http://archphila.org/press%20releases/pr001946.htm |date=2012-07-03 }}; accessed May 10, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;  Large media events, such as the [[Grammy Awards]], [[Alamo Bowl]], etc., often provide a mult box for media at their press conferences as a convenience.&lt;ref&gt;See, ''e.g.'' [http://www.alamobowl.com/main/media_schedule.php Valero Alamo Bowl media schedule &amp; info web page] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120414130344/http://www.alamobowl.com/main/media_schedule.php |date=2012-04-14 }} and [http://www.grammy.org/recording-academy/press-release/apr-05-2012-400-am Grammy Awards press release]; both accessed May 10, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Installation==
A mult box can be an extraordinarily expensive piece of audio-visual equipment to purchase,{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}} so many organizations rent them from a communications company or government agency.  Larger venues may make them available to the media for free, but rent them to private parties.

In 2011, the [[Foreign_relations_of_the_African_Union#Diplomatic_missions|United States Mission to the African Union]] donated a [[state of the art]] mult box to the cash-starved [[African Union]] in a formal ceremony, in which they also presented new [[intern]]s who will be trained to use it.&lt;ref name=AU&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usau.usmission.gov/-mult-box-grant-to-the-auc-09/22/11.html|last=|first=|publisher=United States Mission to the African Union|title=United States Mission to the African Union donates Audio Visual Broadcast Media Mult Box to the AUC|date=September 22, 2011|accessdate=May 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''MyMiniFactory''' is an online community for designers and makers who want to share free or paid 3d printable designs. Unlike other sites, they guarantee the printability of their files. MyMiniFactory has over twelve categories of objects including Toys and Games, Props and Cosplay, Fan Art, Education, Jewellery, Gadgets, board games and tabletop, Home and Garden, Fashion and Accessories, Spare Parts, Sports and Outdoors, and Upcycling.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://3dprint.com/183090/myminifactory-3d-printing-trends/|title=MyMiniFactory: 3D Printing Trends for July 2017 {{!}} 3DPrint.com {{!}} The Voice of 3D Printing / Additive Manufacturing|website=3dprint.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the initiative to preserve the cultural heritage through 3d printing, MyMiniFactory is also home to the largest collection of 3D scanned statues and artifacts from around the globe - the '''Scan The World collection'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.myminifactory.com/scantheworld/|title=Scan The World|website=www.myminifactory.com|language=en|access-date=2018-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://3dprintingindustry.com/news/interview-scan-world-3d-printable-collection-reaches-10000-objects-126326/|title=Interview: Scan the World 3D printable collection reaches 10,000 objects|access-date=2018-08-06|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Launched in 2013, and now hosting over 60,000 3D printable files and objects, and a community of 270,000 users, MyMiniFactory has become the largest guaranteed social platform for 3D printable designs.

'''New Media Distribution/Irjax Enterprises''' was a [[comic book]] [[distributor]] and boutique [[publisher]] active in the 1970s and early 1980s during the growth of the [[direct market]]. After the distribution arm of the company went out of business in 1982, its processing centers and warehouses formed the basis for [[Diamond Comics Distributors]], the now-dominant comics distributor. New Media's publishing arm continued in the business until 1985.

== History ==

=== Origins ===
Hal Shuster, his father, Irwin, and his brother, Jack, formed the paper distribution company '''Irjax Enterprises''' (a play on the names "'''Ir'''win" and "'''Jack'''"), based in [[Rockville, Maryland]], in the 1970s.&lt;ref name="DuinDD"/&gt;

=== Entering the direct market ===
After [[Phil Seuling]] established the [[direct market]] in 1972, his company [[Sea Gate Distributors]] maintained a virtual monopoly on comic book distribution, until a lawsuit brought by Irjax in 1978.&lt;ref name="DuinDD"&gt;"Direct Distribution," in Duin, Steve and [[Mike Richardson (publisher)|Richardson, Mike]] (ed.s). ''Comics Between the Panels'' ([[Dark Horse Comics|Dark Horse Publishing]], 1998), pp. 126-130.&lt;/ref&gt; Irjax sued the comic book publishers [[DC Comics|DC]], [[Marvel Comics|Marvel]], [[Archie Comics|Archie]], and [[Warren Comics|Warren]] for their anti-competitive arrangement with Seagate.&lt;ref&gt;Rozanski, Chuck. [http://www.milehighcomics.com/tales/cbg104.html "Tales From the Database: Chuck Goes to New York Part I,"] Mile High Comics (2004).&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of the lawsuit Irjax gained "a sizeable chunk of the direct-distribution market,"&lt;ref name="DuinDD"/&gt; with distribution centers in Boston and Tampa.&lt;ref name=Diamond-timeline&gt;[http://www.diamondcomics.com/Home/1/1/3/597?articleID=117735 "Diamond Timeline Chronicles 30 Years of Service &amp; Success,"] [[Diamond Comic Distributors, Inc.]] official website. Accessed Feb. 10, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; The Boston-area division was known as '''Solar Spice and Liquors'''&lt;ref&gt;David, Peter. [http://www.peterdavid.net/archives/001238.html "Carol,"] PeterDavid.net (December 11, 2002).&lt;/ref&gt; (named after a fictional corporation created by science fiction writer [[Poul Anderson]]).

=== Steve Geppi ===
{{main|Diamond Comic Distributors}}
Meanwhile, Baltimore retailer [[Steve Geppi]] had four comic book stores&lt;ref name="Resume"&gt;[http://www.businessweek.com/1997/36/b3543113.htm Resume for "Stephen A. Geppi" at BusinessWeek, September 8, 1998]. Accessed March 5, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Success"&gt;Warshaw, Michael. "From Mailman to Tycoon," in DeGarmo, Scott (ed.), ''[[SUCCESS (magazine)|Success]]'' (June, 1994), pp. 28–32.&lt;/ref&gt; and was acting as a sub-distributor, "doing a little informal distributing . . . for smaller retailers." By 1981, Geppi was one of New Media/Irjax's biggest accounts.&lt;ref name="Success"/&gt; In late 1981, the company, now known as '''New Media Distribution''', or '''New Media/Irjax''', filed for Chapter 11.&lt;ref&gt;"Newswatch: NM in Trouble, to File for Chapter 11," ''The Comics Journal'' #70 (January 1982), p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; One of the "last loyal customers" when New Media began having fiscal difficulties, Geppi made a deal with Shuster: "[t]he owner was going into retail," so Geppi agreed to provide Shuster with "free books for a period of time in return for his account list."&lt;ref name="Success"/&gt;

When Hal Shuster relocated to Florida early in 1982,&lt;ref&gt;"Newswatch: New Media Publications Relocates to Florida," ''The Comics Journal'' #71 (March 1982), p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; he asked "Geppi to service more accounts for a bigger discount,"&lt;ref name="Success"/&gt; thereby effectively selling Geppi the distribution end of the business.&lt;ref&gt;"Newswatch: New Media Distribution out of Business," ''The Comics Journal'' #72 (May 1982), p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; Geppi immediately founded [[Diamond Comics Distributors]]. Geppi took over New Media/Irjax's office and warehouse space and had to "sort out the good customers from the bad overnight," negotiating with creditors to continue Shuster's distribution business as Diamond Comic Distributors.&lt;ref name="DuinDiamond"&gt;"Diamond Comic Distributors," in Duin, Steve and [[Mike Richardson (publisher)|Richardson, Mike]] (ed.s). ''Comics Between the Panels'' ([[Dark Horse Comics|Dark Horse Publishing]], 1998), pp. 125-126&lt;/ref&gt;

== Publishing ==
In addition to its distribution business, New Media/Irjax acted as a small publisher from 1976 until 1985.&lt;ref&gt;Bethke, Marilyn. "New Media's Publishing Empire," ''The Comics Journal'' #76 (October 1982), pp. 154-161.&lt;!-- concerns New Media/Irjax, ''Comics Feature'', and ''RBCC'' (''Rocket's Blast Comicollector'')--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Under the names '''Irjax Enterprises''' and then '''New Media Publishing''', it mostly produced periodicals for comics and fantasy/science fiction enthusiasts, the most notable title being ''[[Comics Feature]]''.&lt;ref&gt;"Headlines: New Media Expands Publishing Base, Comics and Commentary Magazines to Begin!" ''Comics Feature'' #6 (October 1980), pp. 7-8.&lt;/ref&gt; The company also published a few original comic book titles (in the adventure and fantasy genres),&lt;ref&gt;"Headlines: New Media Expands: Heroines, Romance Titles Added," ''Comics Feature'' #12/13 (Sept./Oct. 1981), p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt; usually featuring creators pulled from the ranks of [[fandom]]. The company published out of [[Largo, Florida]]; [[Tampa, Florida]]; and finally [[Studio City, California]].

Notable names who worked for New Media/Irjax as editors and/or writers include [[Carol Kalish]], [[Kurt Busiek]], and [[Peter B. Gillis]].&lt;ref&gt;"Headlines: NMP Editorial Shake-Up," ''Comics Feature'' #12/13 (Sept./Oct. 1981), p. 18: Peter Gillis leaves New Media Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt;

His father, who had migrated to Ganja from Qom in north central Iran, may have been a civil servant; his mother was a daughter of a Kurdish chieftain; having lost both parents early in his life, Nizami was brought up by an uncle. He was married three times, and in his poems laments the death of each of his wives, as well as proferring advice to his son Muhammad. He lived in an age of both political instability and intense intellectual activity, which his poems reflect; but little is known about his life, his relations with his patrons, or the precise dates of his works, as the accounts of later biographers are colored by the many legends built up around the poet''}}&lt;/ref&gt; or '''Nezāmi''', whose formal name was ''Jamal ad-Dīn Abū Muḥammad Ilyās ibn-Yūsuf ibn-Zakkī'',&lt;ref name="moin"&gt;Mo'in, Muhammad(2006), "Tahlil-i Haft Paykar-i Nezami", Tehran.: p. 2: Some commentators have mentioned his name as “Ilyas the son of Yusuf the son of Zakki the son of Mua’yyad” while others have mentioned that Mu’ayyad is a title for Zakki.  Mohammad Moin, rejects the first interpretation claiming that if it were to mean 'Zakki son of Muayyad' it should have been read as 'Zakki i Muayyad' where izafe (-i-) shows the son-parent relationship but here it is 'Zakki Muayyad' and Zakki ends in silence/stop and there is no izafe (-i-). Some may argue that izafe is dropped due to meter constraints but dropping parenthood izafe is very strange and rare. So it is possible that Muayyad was a sobriquet for Zaki or part of his name (like Muayyad al-Din Zaki).

Little is known of his life, the only source being his own works, which in many cases provided no reliable information. We can only deduce that he was born between 535 and 540 (1140–46) and that his background was urban.

The verse (quoted on p. 14): "I am lost as a pearl in the sea of Ganja, yet I am from the Qohestan of the city of Qom ", does not expressly mean that he was born in Qom. On the other hand, Nizami's mother was of Kurdish origin, and this might point to Ganja where the Kurdish dynasty of Shaddad ruled down to AH. 468; even now Kurds are found to the south of Ganja."

Excerpt: "In the Shahnama, Firdawsi already makes Iskandar  an exemplary figure, whom the companionship of Aristotle helps to rise still higher, by the path of wisdom and moderation, in the direction of abstinence and contempt for this world. And Firdwasi laid stress on the defeat of Dārā (the Darius of the Greeks) as something desired by "the rotation of the Heavens"....At the time of Niẓami, however, Islam is from then onwards well established in Iran, and it is the prophetic and ecumenical aspect of his destiny that the poet makes evident in his hero. As a learned Iranian poet, Niẓami, who demonstrates his eclecticism in the information he gives (he says, "I have taken from everything just what suited me and I have borrowed from recent histories, Christian, Pahlavi and Jewish ... and of them I have made a whole"), locates the story of his hero principally in Iran.

В частности, в 1938 г. Низами в связи с его 800-летним юбилеем был объявлен гениальным азербайджанским поэтом (История, 1939. С. 88–91). На самом деле он был персидским поэтом, что и неудивительно, так как городское население в те годы было представлено персами (Дьяконов, 1995. С. 731). В свое время это признавалось всеми энциклопедическими словарями, выходившими в России, и лишь Большая Советская Энциклопедия впервые в 1939 г. объявила Низами "великим азербайджанским поэтом" (Ср. Брокгауз и Ефрон, 1897. С. 58; Гранат, 1917. С. 195; БСЭ, 1939. С. 94). Translation from Russian: "By that time, already mentioned Iranian and Armenian factors contributed to the rapid azerbaijanization of historical heroes and historical political entities on the territory of Azerbaijan. In particular, in 1938, Nizami in connection with his 800-year anniversary was declared a genius(marvelous) Azerbaijani poet (History, 1939. pp. 88–91). In fact, he was a Persian poet, which is not surprising, because the urban population in those years was Persian (Dyakonov, 1995. page. 731). At one time it was recognized by all Encyclopedic Dictionaries of published in Russia, and only the Big Soviet Encyclopedia for the first time in 1939, announced Nizami as a "Great Azerbaijani poet" (Sr. Brockhaus and Efron, 1897. page. 58; Garnet, 1917. page. 195 ; BSE, 1939. p. 94)".--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Excerpt: "Indeed, the 1934 Congress of Soviet Writers, which in many ways inaugurated high Stalinism as a cultural paradigm, was a curiously solemn parade of old-fashioned romantic nationalisms. Pushkin, Tolstoy and other officially restored Russian icons were not the only national giants of international stature – all Soviet peoples possessed, or would shortly acquire, their own classics, their own founding fathers and their own folkloric riches.

Excerpt: "The attempt to 'annex' an important part of Persian literature and to transform it into 'Azerbaidzhani literature' can be best exemplified by the way in which the memory of the great Persian poet Nizami (1141—1203) is exploited in the Soviet Union. The Soviet regime does not pay tribute to Nizami as a great representative of world literature, but is mainly interested in him as a ‘poet of the Soviet Union’, which he is considered to be because he was born in Gandzha in the territory of the present Azerbaidzhani Soviet Republic. The Soviet regime proclaims its ownership over Nizami also by ‘interpreting’ his works in accordance with the general pattern of Soviet ideology. Thus the leading Soviet journal Bolshevik stressed that Nizami's ‘great merit’ consisted in having undermined Islam by ‘opposing the theological teaching of the unchangeable character of the world’.  Stalin himself intervened in the dispute over Nizami and gave an authoritative verdict on the matter. In a talk with the Ukrainian writer, Mikola Bazhan, Stalin referred to Nizami as ‘the great poet of our brotherly Azerbaidzhani people’who must not be surrendered to Iranian literature, despite having written most of his poems in Persian."

===Family===
Nezami was married three times.  His first wife was a [[Kipchaks|Kipchak]] slave girl which was sent to him by Fakhr al-Din Bahramshah, the ruler of [[Derbent|Darband]], as part of a larger gift. According to Iraj Bashiri she became Nezami's "most beloved" wife. His only son ''Mohammad'' was from this wife. She died after "[[Khosrow and Shirin]]" was completed. Mohammad was seven at the time. Nezami mentions his son again in Layli and Majnun adding that now this son is 14 years old and "apple of my eyes". In "Haft Peykar" (Seven Beauties), he also mentions and advises his son about taking more responsibility as the father was growing more frail.

Some modern writers in the late 20th century have claimed that this wife was called ''Afaq''. Vahid Dastgerdi seems to be the first writer to propose this name for Nezami's first wife, but Said Nafisi (at the same time) and a recent source have challenged this interpretation of the corresponding verse in Nezami's work and the assumption that ''Afaq'' was the real name of his wife &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Siavash Lornejad, Ali Doostzadeh |title=On the Modern Politicization of the Persian Poet Nezami Ganjavi |publisher=Victoria Arakelova, YEREVAN SERIES FOR ORIENTAL STUDIES (Editor of the Series Garnik Asatrian), Caucasian Centre for Iranian Studies |location= Yerevan |year=2012 |pages= 173–175 |url=https://archive.org/download/OnTheModernPoliticizationOfThePersianPoetNezamiGanjavi_251/nezami_digital_version_final_2012.pdf |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="archive1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/OnTheModernPoliticizationOfThePersianPoetNezamiGanjavi_251 |title=ON THE MODERN POLITICIZATION OF THE PERSIAN POET NEZAMI GANJAVI: Siavash Lornejad, Ali Doostzadeh: Free Download &amp; Streaming: Internet Archive |publisher=Archive.org |date=2001-03-10 |accessdate=2014-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; and have taken the ''Afaq'' in that verse to simply mean "horizon" rather than a proper name. Strangely enough, Nezami's two other wives, too, died prematurely – the death of each coinciding with the completion of an epic, prompting the poet to say, "God, why is it that for every mathnavi I must sacrifice a wife!".&lt;ref&gt;Iraj Bashiri,[http://www.angelfire.com/rnb/bashiri/Teahouse/Figures.html#Nizami "The Teahouse at a Glance" – Nizami's Life and Works], 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

However, he is regarded as a philosopher&lt;ref name="Nasr"/&gt; and gnostic&lt;ref name="Nasr"/&gt; who mastered various fields of Islamic thoughts which he synthesized in a way that brings to mind the traditions of later Hakims such as [[Qutb al-Din Shirazi]].&lt;ref name="Nasr"/&gt;

Often referred to by the honorific Hakim ("the Sage"), Nezami is both a learned poet and master of a lyrical and sensuous style.  About Nezami's prodigious learning there is no doubt. Poets were expected to be well versed in many subjects; but Nezami seems to have been exceptionally so.  His poems show that not only he was fully acquainted with [[Arabic]] and [[Persian language|Persian]] literatures and with oral and written popular and local traditions, but was also familiar with such diverse fields as [[mathematics]], [[astronomy]],&lt;ref name="Gelpke"/&gt; [[astrology]],&lt;ref name="Gelpke"/&gt; [[alchemy]], [[medicine]], [[botany]], Koranic exegesis, [[Islamic]] theory and [[law]], [[Iranian Peoples|Iranian]] myths and legends,&lt;ref&gt;Maria Sutenly, "Visionary Rose: Metaphorical Application of Horticultural Practice in Persian Culture" in Michel Conan and W. John Kress, "Botanical progress, horticultural information and cultural changes", Dumbarton Oaks, 2007.  p. 12: "In a highly evocative tale he relates in the Makhzan al-Asrar ("Treasury of Secrets"), the twelfth-century Persian poet, Nizami whose oeuvre is an acknowledged repository of Iranian myths and legends, illustrates the way in which the rose was perceived in the Medieval Persian imagination"&lt;/ref&gt; history, [[ethics]], [[philosophy]] and [[thought|esoteric thought]], music, and the [[visual arts]].&lt;ref name="Oxford" /&gt;  His strong character, social sensibility, and knowledge of oral and written historical records, as well as his rich Persian&lt;ref name="ChelkowskiMirror"&gt;Peter J. Chelkowski, "Mirror of the Invisible World", New York: Metropolitan Museum of Art, 1975.
p. 1: "The culture of Nizami's Persia is renowned for its deep-rooted tradition and splendor. In pre-Islamic times, it had developed extraordinarily rich and exact means of expression in music, architecture, and daily life as well as in writing, although Iran, its center—or, as the poets believed, its heart—was continually overrun by invading armies and immigrants, this tradition was able to absorb, transform, and ultimately ocercome foreign intrusion. Alexander the Great was only one of many conquerors, to be seduced by the Persian way of life."
p. 2:"During the last quarter of the twelfth century, when Nizami began his Khamsa, Seljuq supremacy was on the decline and political unrest and social ferments were increasing. However, Persian culture characteristically flourished when political power was diffused rather than centralized, and so Persian remained the primary language, Persian civil servants were in great demand, Persian merchants were successful, and princedoms continued to vie for the service of Persian poets. This was especially true in Ganjeh, the Caucasian outpost town where Nizami lived."
p. 6: "Nizami's strong character, his social sensibility, and his poetic genius fused with his rich Persian cultural heritage to create a new standard of literary achievement.  Using themes from the oral tradition and written historical records, his poems unite pre-Islamic and Islamic Iran", p. 9:"Probably no Persian writer has inspired succeeding generation of poets more than Nizami", p. 6: ""Khosrow and Shirin" proved to be a literary turning point not only for Nizami but for all of [[Persian poetry]].  Furthermore it was the first poem in Persian literature to achieve complete structural and artistic unity".  p. 2;"During the last quarter of the twelfth century, when Nizami began his Khamsa, Seljuq supremacy was on the decline and political unrest and social ferments were increasing. However, Persian culture characteristically flourished when political power was diffused rather than centralized, and so Persian remained the primary language, Persian civil servants were in great demand, Persian merchants were successful, and princedoms continued to vie for the service of Persian poets. This was especially true in Ganjeh, the Caucasian outpost town where Nizami lived." p. 1: "By the end of the tenth century, Persian literature was world renowned; it was heralded from the eastern Mediterranean to the banks of the Indus" pp2:"Few facts about the life of Nizami are certain.  Because he was not a court poet and it was his poetry rather than his life or his political connections that won him enduring fame, he does not appear in the annals of the dynasties...".  p. 9: "The memorization and recitation of their literary heritage has alway beens vital to Iranians, whose attitude towards the power of the written and spoken word is revential. Even today the national passion for poetry is constantly expressed over radio and television, in teahouses, in literary societies, in daily conversation, and in the Musha'areh, the poetry recitation contest. Nizami's work serves as a vehicle and a symbol of this tradition, for it unites universality with deep-rooted artistic endeavor, a sense of justice and passion for the arts and sciences with spirituallity and genuine piety. for richness and fineness of metaphor, accuracy, and profundity of psychological observation, and sheer virtuosity of storytelling, Nizami is unequalled"&lt;/ref&gt; cultural heritage unite pre-Islamic and Islamic Iran into the creation of a new standard of literary achievement.  Being a product of the Iranian&lt;ref name="ChelkowskiEskandar"/&gt; culture of the time, he not only created a bridge between pre-Islamic and Islamic Iran, but also between Iran&lt;ref name="ChelkowskiEskandar"/&gt; and the whole ancient world.

The recent discovery and publication of the anthology titled ''[[Nozhat al-Majales]]'' contains Persian language quatrains from Nizami and 115 other poets from the northwestern Iran (Arrān, Šarvān, Azerbaijan; including 24 poets from Ganja alone) during the same era.&lt;ref name="Nozhat"/&gt;  Unlike other parts of Persia,  where the poets mostly belonged to higher echelons of society such as scholars, bureaucrats, and secretaries, a good number of poets in the northwestern areas rose from among the common people with working-class backgrounds, and they frequently used colloquial expressions in their poetry.&lt;ref name="Nozhat"/&gt;  Accordingly, the book demonstrates the social conditions at the time, reflecting the full spread of Persian language and the culture in the region, which is evidenced by the common use of spoken idioms in poems and the professions of many of the poets.&lt;ref name="Nozhat"/&gt;  The influence of the northwestern Pahlavi language, for example, which had been the spoken dialect of the region, is clearly observed in the poems contained in this anthology.&lt;ref name="Nozhat"/&gt;  However, at the same time, the Caucasus region was entertaining a unique mixture of ethnic cultures.&lt;ref name="Nozhat"/&gt; [[Khaqani]]'s mother was a [[Nestorian Christian]], Mojir Baylqani's mother was an [[Armenians|Armenian]], and Nezami's mother was a [[Kurd]].&lt;ref name="Nozhat"/&gt; Their works reflect the cultural and linguistic diversity of the region.&lt;ref name="Nozhat"/&gt;

By the end of the 10th century,&lt;ref name="ChelkowskiMirror"/&gt; Persian literature became widespread from the eastern Mediterranean to the banks of the Indus.  The earliest extant example of Persian poetry from the area is that of [[Qatran Tabrizi]](1009–1072) who served in the courts of the [[Shaddadid]] and [[Rawadid]] dynasties.  Qatran Tabrizi, is credited with what some scholars in the last century have termed as the founder of the "Azerbaijan"&lt;ref name="Oxford"/&gt; or "Trans-Cacausian" school&lt;ref&gt;Rypka, Jan. "Poets and Prose Writers of the Late Saljuq and Mongol Periods", The Cambridge History of Iran, Volume 5, The Saljuq and Mongol Periods, ed., Published January 1968. Excerpt: "The school, which begins with Qatran (d. 1072), formed a well defined group of teachers and pupils of whom two, Khaqani and Nezami, were to exert a lasting development of their respective genre: Khaqani being the greatest exponent of the qasida and Nezami the most brilliant writer of romantic epics".&lt;/ref&gt; or "Tabriz School"&lt;ref name="ChelkowskiPeterIS"&gt;P. Chelkowski, "Literature in Pre-Safavid Isfahan", International Society for Iranian Studies, Vol. 7, No. 1/2. — Taylor &amp; Francis, Ltd. on behalf of International Society for Iranian Studies, 1974. — p. 112-131.) Quote: "The three main literary styles which follow each other consecutively are known as: Khurasani, Iraqi, and Hindi. The time spans of each style are equally flexible. Within these broad geographical divisions we then come across certain "literary schools" which reflect regional peculiarities and idiosyncrasies and are identified with smaller entities like provinces or towns. For example, there are: the Azerbayjani school, The Tabriz school, or the Shirvan school."&lt;/ref&gt; or "Shirvan School"&lt;ref name="ChelkowskiPeterIS"/&gt; or "Arranian Style"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/NozhatAl-majales|title=Nozhat al-Majales|first=|last=Author passed away 700 years ago|date=|publisher=|accessdate=5 April 2018|via=Internet Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://tarnama.org/library/Nozhat.al-Majales.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; of Persian poetry.  This school produced a distinctive style of poetry in Persian, which contrasted with "Khurasani" ("Eastern") style in its rhetorical sophistication, its innovative use of metaphor, its use of [[technical terminology]] and [[Christian]] imagery, the presence of Persian&lt;ref&gt;Daniela Meneghini, “Saljuqs: Saljuqid Literature” in Encyclopedia Iranica. Excerpt:"The Saljuqs never governed the vast conquered territories as a centralized empire. The main power centers were Hamadān and Isfahan in the west, and Marv and Nišāpur (Nishapur) in the east, but their courts changed location several times over the decades. There were also branches of the Saljuq dynasty in Kermān, Syria, and in Anatolia, and the dynasty’s strong tendency towards decentralization led in the 12th century to the establishment of the atābak, or ‘parallel’ dynasties of Turkish slaves, put in government in some areas (Marāḡa, Tabriz, Shiraz, etc.) ‘external’ to the main centers of power. This phenomenon favored the development of a vigorous cultural life in cities such as Ray, Shiraz, and Yazd and especially in the urban centers of Azerbaijan and Arrān such as Tabriz and Šervān.” “With their capital, Šarvān (Šervān), in the lands of the eastern Caucasus, the Šarvānšāh dynasty also always maintained its independence from the Great Saljqus” “The geographical closeness of the territories subject to the Ildeguzids and those under the Šarvānšāh encouraged the flow of intellectuals and poets from one court to the other. It is also possible to speak of a certain similarity of inspiration and of style between the poets born and educated in these areas, to the point of defining them as belonging to the ‘Azerbaijan school’ (Rypka, Hist. Iran Lit., pp. 201–9). The complexity of the language and of the compositional techniques, the originality and multiplicity of the themes, the presence of Persian archaisms and, at the same time, a wide range of borrowings from Arabic vocabulary are among the stylistic features which are common to poets in this cultural context compared with other contemporaries closer to the Khorasani style.”&lt;/ref&gt; archaism while borrowing from Arabic vocabulary, as well as new concepts.&lt;ref name="Nozhat"/&gt;  Other sources including the Encyclopaedia of Islam and traditional Iranian literary sources have used the term "'Iraqi" style for the Persian poetry of Nezami.&lt;ref&gt;De Bruijn, J.T.P. (1997), “Iran: Literature”, Encyclopaedia of Islam, New Ed., vol. IV:52–75.  excerpt: "“On the other hand he enriched the romantic mathnawi by using imagery of lyric poetry to the full, treating it with all the rhetorical ingenuity characteristic of the 'Iraqi style”"&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:King Qizil Arslan Welcomes the Poet Nizami.jpg|300px|thumbnail|left|[[Eldiguzids|Atabeg of Azerbaijan]] [[Qizil Arslan]] welcomes Nizami]]
The [[Seljuqs]] took control of [[Ganja, Azerbaijan|Ganja]] from the [[Shaddadid]]s in 1075 and spread Persian literary westwards to their courts.  In the middle of the 12th century, the [[Great Seljuq Empire|Seljuk]]s control of the region weakened and their provincial governors, virtually autonomous local princes, further encouraged Persian&lt;ref name="ChelkowskiEskandar"/&gt; culture, art and poetry in their courts.  Persian culture characteristically flourished in this era when political power was diffused and Persian remained the primary language, Persian civil cervants, merchants were in great demand and rival dynastines continue to vie for the service of Persian poets.&lt;ref name="ChelkowskiMirror"/&gt;  This was especially true in Ganjeh, the Caucasian outpost town where Nizami lived.&lt;ref name="ChelkowskiMirror"/&gt;  Nezami was patronized by different rulers and dedicated his epics to various rival dynasties including the [[Seljuqs]], [[Atabegs of Azerbaijan|Eldiguzids]](who maintained control of Ganja during most of the later 12th century), [[Shirvanshah]]s, the ruler of Ahar and [[Ahmadilis]].  Although he enjoyed the patronage of various rulers and princes, he avoided the court life and is generally believed to have lived a secluded life.  Since he was not a court poet, he does not appear in the annals of the dynasties which list the names of events of the ruling families.&lt;ref name="ChelkowskiMirror"/&gt;

According to Professor Chelkowski: ''It seems that Nezami's favorite pastime was reading [[Ferdowsi|Firdawsi's]] monumental epic [[Shahnameh]] (The book of Kings)''.&lt;ref name="ChelkowskiEskandar"&gt;(Chelkowski, P. "Nezami's Iskandarnameh:" in Colloquio sul poeta persiano Nizami e la leggenda iranica di Alessandro magno, Roma, 1977).
p. 10: "The Persian legend of Alexander the Great seems to overshadow all of the other fantastic Alexander stories not only in the tale of the successful accomplishment of many a "mission-impossible" but especially concerning the nature of his career.  In Iran he rose from the stature of a damned evil conqueror of the country, to that of a national Iranian hero king, and even more, to that of the great prophet of God, preparing all the nations for the true religion.  Yet the Persian legend of Alexander is very little known in the Western world."
p. 13: "Nizami was a typical product of the Iranian culture.  He created a bridge between Islamic Iran and pre-Islamic Iran and also between Iran and the whole ancient world.  His great humanism, strong character, sensibility, drama, colorful description of nature, rich language, and the poetic genius created a new standard of literary achievements and captured the imagination of countless imitators".
p. 17: "In the case of previous romances of Khosraw and Bahram, Nizami dealt with national Iranian heroes, though from pre-Islamic times.  In the tale of Layla and Majnun, the Arab nationality of the lover is of no importance since the story is based on a simple Arab folktale which was later absorbed and embellished by the Persians".
p. 19: "Alexander was glorified by the Muslims as a divine agent, a prophet-king and the blessed conqueror of the lands that were to become the stronghold of Islam.  To some Muslims, Islam was a realization of Alexander's "koine" --- a commonwealth where people could live in harmony and in peace of heart and mind.  In this atmosphere attempts were made to make out of Alexander not only a Muslim but a Persian as well".
p. 21: "However, it was not Tabari directly, but Ferdowsi who was Nizami's source of inspiration and material in composing Iskandarnameh. Nizami constantly alludes to the Shahnameh in his writing, especially in the prologue to the Iskandarnameh. It seems that he was always fascinated by the work of Firdawsi and made it a goal of his life to write an heroic epic of the same stature.
p. 22: "It seems that Nezami's favorite pastime was reading [[Ferdowsi|Firdawsi's]] monumental epic [[Shahnameh]] (The book of Kings)".
p. 22: "In fact, although Alexander conquered Iran, he was soon conquered by Persian customs and ways of life.  In many aspects he was so overwhelmed by Persian civilization that he became more Persian than the Persians.  He tried to make a blend of the Greek and Persian civilization --- even genetically, when he sponsored mass marriages between his troops and Persian women.  He himself married Roxane (Rowshanak) the daughter of the Sogdian prince – not the daughter of Darius the Third, as both Firdawsi and Nizami believed.  Like Alexander, Arabs, Turks, Mongols and other people who overran the Iranian plateau also came under the spell of Persian culture. Foreign invaders remained to become contributors and patrons of Persian art and culture. To give one example, some of Nizami's benefactors were of Turkic stock."&lt;/ref&gt;  Nezami has mentioned [[Ferdowsi]] as the Sage (Hakim) and Knower/Wise (daanaa) and the great master of discourse: ''who has decorated words like new bride''.  Nezami advises the son of the [[Shirvanshah]] to read the Shah-nama and to remember the meaningful sayings of the wise.&lt;ref&gt;Dr. Ali Asghar Seyed Gohrab. "Layli and Majnun: Love, Madness and Mystic Longing", Brill Studies in Middle Eastern literature, Jun 2003. p. 276.&lt;/ref&gt;  Nezami has used the [[Shahnameh]] as a source in his three epics of "Haft Paykar", "[[Khosrow and Shirin]]" and "Eskandar-nameh".&lt;ref name="ChelkowskiEskandar"/&gt;

The story of ''[[Vis and Ramin]]'' also had an immense influence on Nezami.  Although Nezami takes the bases for most of his plots from [[Ferdowsi]], but the basis for his rhetoric comes from Gorgani.&lt;ref name="DavisIranica"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/vis-o-ramin |title=VIS O RĀMIN – Encyclopaedia Iranica |publisher=Iranicaonline.org |date=2005-07-20 |accessdate=2014-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This is especially noticeable in the Khosrow and Shirin, which is of the same meter and imitates some scenes from ''Vis and Ramin''.  Nezami's concern with astrology also has a precedent in an elaborate astrological description of the night sky in ''Vis and Ramin''.  Nezami had a paramount influence on the romantic tradition, and Gorgani can be said to have initiated much of the distinctive rhetoric and poetic atmosphere of this tradition, with the absence of the [[Sufi]] influences, which are seen in Nezami's epic poetry.

The first monumental work of Nezami, the Makhzan al-Asrar is influenced by [[Sanai]]'s "Hadikat al-Hakika".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Nezami lived in an age of both political instability and intense intellectual activity, which his poems reflect; but little is known about his life, his relations with his patrons, or the precise dates of his works, as the many legends built up around the poet color the accounts of his later biographers.

===Persian lyrical poetry===
Only a small corpus of his lyric poetry, mainly qaṣīdahs ("odes") and [[ghazals]] ("lyrics") have survived.  Ten of his quatrains have also been recorded in the anthology [[Nozhat al-Majales]] (which was compiled around 1250) by Jamal Khalil Shirvani&lt;ref name="Nozhat"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/nozhat-al-majales |title=NOZHAT AL-MAJĀLES – Encyclopaedia Iranica |publisher=Iranicaonline.org |date= |accessdate=2014-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; along with 23 other poets from [[Ganja, Azerbaijan|Ganja]].  A famous [[ghazal]] of Nezami talks about altruism as the path for reaching the ultimate spiritual goal:

{{cquote|
I went to the Tavern last night, but I was not admitted&lt;br /&gt;
I was bellowing yet nobody was listening to me&lt;br /&gt;
Either none of the wine-sellers were awake&lt;br /&gt;
Or I was a nobody, and no one opened the door for a Nobody&lt;br /&gt;
When more or less half of the night had passed&lt;br /&gt;
A shrewd, perfect man (rind) raised his head from a booth and showed his face&lt;br /&gt;
I asked him: “to open the door”, he told me: “go away, do not talk nonsense!&lt;br /&gt;
At this hour, nobody opens door for anybody&lt;br /&gt;
This is not a mosque where its doors are open any moment&lt;br /&gt;
Where you can come late and move quickly to the first row&lt;br /&gt;

===Quinary ("Panj Ganj" or "Khamsa")===
Nezami is best known for his five long narrative poems, which have been preserved.  He dedicated his poems to various rulers of the region as was custom of that time for great poets, but avoided court life.  Nezami was a master of the ''[[Masnavi]]'' style (double-rhymed verses).  He wrote poetical works; the main one is the ''Panj Ganj'' (Persian: Five Treasures), also known by the Persian pronunciation of the Arabic word ''Khamsa'' ("Quintet" or "Quinary").  The first of his five 'Treasures', called ''The Storehouse of Mysteries'',&lt;ref name="IranicaClassical"&gt;CHARLES-HENRI DE FOUCHÉCOUR, "IRAN:Classical Persian Literature" in ''Encyclopædia Iranica''&lt;/ref&gt; was influenced by [[Sanai]] of Ghazna's (d. 1131) monumental Garden of Truth.  The other ‘Treasures’ were medieval romances. Khusaw and Shirin, Bahrām-e Gur, and Alexander the Great, who all have episodes devoted to them in Ferdowsi's Book of Kings,&lt;ref name="IranicaClassical"/&gt; appear again here at the center of three of four of Nezami's narrative poems. The adventure of the paired lovers, Leyli and Majnun, is the subject of the second of his four romances, and derived from Arabic sources.&lt;ref name="IranicaClassical"/&gt; In all these cases, Nezami reworked the material from his sources in a substantial way.&lt;ref name="IranicaClassical"/&gt;

The ''Khamsa'' was a popular subject for lavish manuscripts illustrated with painted miniatures at the Persian and [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] courts in later centuries.  Examples include the [[Khamsa of Nizami (British Library, Or. 12208)]], created for the Mughal Emperor [[Akbar]] in the 1590s.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

The ''Quinary'' (Five Treasures-Panj Ganj) includes the five Persian books of Nezami:

====Makhzan al-Asrar====
*'''Makhzan al-Asrar''' (Persian: مخزن الاسرار) "The Treasury of Mysteries" (1163) (some date it 1176)
The ethico-philosophical poems of about 2,250 Persian [[distich]]s was dedicated to Fakhr al-Din Bahramshah, the ruler of Erzinjan.  The story deals with such esoteric subjects as philosophy and theology. The story contains twenty discourses, each of them portraying an exemplary story on religious and ethical topics.  Each chapter concludes with apostrophe to the poet himself containing his pen name.&lt;ref name="JTP"&gt;JTP de Bruijn. Persian Sufi Poetry, An Introduction to the Mystical – Taylor and Francis (Routledge) 1997 pp. 97–98&lt;/ref&gt;  The content of the poems are indicated in the heading to each chapter and are written in a typical [[Homiletics]] style.&lt;ref name="JTP"/&gt; The stories which discuss spiritual and practical concerns enjoin kingly justice, riddance of hypocrisy, warning of vanity of this world and the need to prepare for the after-life.&lt;ref name="Oxford"/&gt;  The general message of the discourse is that Nezami preaches the ideal way of life drawing attention to his reader of the supreme rank man among God's creatures and approaching of the end life and the necessity of man becoming aware of his spiritual destination.&lt;ref name="JTP"/&gt;  In a few chapters he address the duties of a King, but as a whole he addresses himself to mankind in general&lt;ref name="JTP"/&gt; rather than his royal patrons.  In the introduction, the poet provides an account of his solitary vigils, called Khalwat.&lt;ref name="JTP"/&gt;  There is no indication that these were [[Sufi]] vigils, but are used as a literally fantasy on the duty of spiritually inclined poet he wanted to be.&lt;ref name="JTP"/&gt;  In highly rhetorical style, the aim he pursues is to transcend the limitation of secular literature of the courts.&lt;ref name="JTP"/&gt;  With this work, Nezami joins the destination of Persian poetry which had started with [[Sanai]] and was continued by others, in the first place by [[Attar Neyshapuri|Attar]].&lt;ref name="JTP"/&gt;

Not a romantic epic, "The Treasury of Mysteries" was translated into English by Gholam H. Darab in 1945.&lt;ref&gt;Darab, Gholam Hossein. Treasury of Mysteries, translation of Makhzanol Asrar. (London:. Arthur Probsthain, 1945).&lt;/ref&gt;  After this early work, Nezami turned into narrative poetry.

*'''Khosrow o Shirin'''(Persian: خسرو و شیرین) "[[Khosrow and Shirin]]" (1177–1180)
A story of pre-Islamic&lt;ref name="ChelkowskiEskandar"/&gt; Persian origin which is found in the great epico-historical poems of Shahnameh and is based on a true story that was further romanticized by Persian poets.&lt;ref name="KhosrowShirinIranica"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/kosrow-o-sirin |title=ḴOSROW O ŠIRIN – Encyclopaedia Iranica |publisher=Iranicaonline.org |date= |accessdate=2014-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The story  chosen by Nezami, was commissioned and dedicated to the Seljuk Sultan Toghril II, the Atabek Muhammad ibn Eldiguz Jahan Pahlavan and his brother [[Qizil Arslan]].  It contains about 6,500 distichs in length, the story depicts the love of [[Sassanid Empire|Sassanian]] [[Khosrau II|Khosrow II Parviz]] towards his Armenian&lt;ref name="eskandar"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/eskandar-nama-of-nezami |title=ESKANDAR-NĀMA OF NEŻĀMĪ – Encyclopaedia Iranica |publisher=Iranicaonline.org |date= |accessdate=2014-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; princess [[Shirin]].  "Khusrow and Shirin" recounts the story of King Khosrow's courtship of Princess Shirin, and vanquishing of his love-rival, Farhad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/farhad%20(1) |title=FARHĀD (1) – Encyclopaedia Iranica |publisher=Iranicaonline.org |date=1999-12-15 |accessdate=2014-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The story has a complex structure with several genres exploited simultaneously; and contains many verbal exchanges and letters, all imbued with lyrical intensity.&lt;ref name="IranicaClassical"/&gt;  Khosrow endures long journeys, physical and spiritual, before returning to Shirin, his true love.&lt;ref name="IranicaClassical"/&gt; They are eventually married, but eventually Khosrow is killed by his son and Shirin commits suicide over the body of her murdered husband.&lt;ref name="IranicaClassical"/&gt; Pure and selfless love is represented here embodied in the figure of Farhad, secretly in love with Shirin, who finally falls victim to the king's ire and jealousy.&lt;ref name="IranicaClassical"/&gt;

The influence of [[Vis o Ramin]] is visible as the poem imitates a major scene (that of the lovers arguing in the snow) from Vis o Rāmin, as well as being in the same meter ([[hazaj meter|''hazaj'']]) as Gorgāni's poem.&lt;ref name="DavisIranica"/&gt;  Nezami's concern with astrology also has a precedent in an elaborate astrological description of the night sky in Vis o Rāmin.&lt;ref name="DavisIranica"/&gt;  In turn, Nezami's great work had a tremendous influence on later authors and many imitations of this work were made.&lt;ref name="KhosrowShirinIranica"/&gt;  With complete artistic and structural unity, the epic of Khosrow o Shirin turned to be a turning point not only for Nizami but for all of Persian literature.&lt;ref name="ChelkowskiMirror"/&gt;

====Layli o Majnun====
*'''Layli o Majnun'''(Persian: لیلی و مجنون) "[[Layla and Majnun]]" (1192)

A story of Arabic origin&lt;ref name="IranicaLayla"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/leyli-o-majnun-narrative-poem |title=LEYLI O MAJNUN – Encyclopaedia Iranica |publisher=Iranicaonline.org |date=2009-07-15 |accessdate=2014-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was later absorbed and embellished by the Persians.&lt;ref name="ChelkowskiEskandar"/&gt;  The poem of 4,600 distichs was dedicated, in 1192, to Abu al-Muzaffar Shirvanshah, who claimed descent from the Sassanid King, whose exploits are reflected in Nezami's "Seven Beauties"(Haft Paykar).  The poem is based on the popular Arab legend of ill-starred lovers: the poet Qays falls in love with his cousin Layla, but is prevented from marrying her by Layla's father.  Layla's father forbids contact with Qays and Qays becomes obsessed and starts signing of his love for Layla in public.  The obsession becomes so severe that he sees and evaluates everything in terms of Layla; hence his sobriquet "the possessed" (Majnun).&lt;ref name="IranicaLayla"/&gt;  Realizing that cannot obtain union even when other people intercede for him, he leaves society and roams naked in the desert among the beasts.  However the image of Layla was so ingrained in him that he cannot eat or sleep.  His only activity becomes composing poetry of longing for Layla.&lt;ref name="IranicaLayla"/&gt;  Meanwhile, Layla is married against her will, but she guards her virginity by resisting the advances of her husband.  Arranging a secret meeting with Majnun, they meet, but have no physical contact.  Rather they recite poetry to each other from a distance. Layla's husband dies eventually which removes the legal obstacles to a licit union.  However Majnun is so focused on the ideal picture of Layla in his mind that he had fled to the desert.  Layla dies out of grief and is buried in her bridal dress.  Hearing this news, Majun rushes to her grave where he instantly dies.  They are buried side by side and their grave becomes a site of pilgrimage.  Someone dreams that in Paradise they are united and live as a king and queen.&lt;ref name="IranicaLayla"/&gt;  Nezami composed his romance at the request of the [[Shirvanshah]] Akhsatan.  Initially, he doubted that this simple story about the agony and pain of an Arab boy wandering in rough mountains and burning deserts would be a suitable subject for royal court poetry and his cultured audience.&lt;ref name="IranicaLayla"/&gt;  It was his son who persuaded him to undertake the project, saying: "wherever tales of love are read, this will add spice to them".&lt;ref name="IranicaLayla"/&gt;  Nezami used many Arabic anecdotes in the story but also adds a strong Persian flavor to the legend.&lt;ref name="IranicaLayla"/&gt;  He adapted the disconnected stories about Majnun to fit the requirement of a Persian romance.&lt;ref name="EIslamLayla"&gt;[[Charles Pellat|Pellat, Ch.]]; Bruijn, J.T.P. de; Flemming, B.; Haywood, J.A.

Brill Online. Excerpts: "The theme was chosen for the first time as the subject of a Persian narrative poem, but the precedent of the treatment of a similar subject of Arabic origin existed in ʿAyyūḳī's Warḳa u Gulshāh.  Niẓāmī states in the introduction to his poem that he accepted the assignment with some hesitation. At first, he doubted whether this tale of madness and wanderings through the wilderness would be suitable for a royal court (ed. Moscow 1965, pp. 41 ff.).  He adapted the disconnected stories to fit the requirements of a Persian romance. ...In some respects, the Bedouin setting of the original has been changed under the influence of urban conditions more familiar to the poet and his audience: the young lovers become acquainted at school; the generous Nawfal is a prince in the Iranian style rather than an Arab official. Niẓāmī added a second pair of lovers, Zayn and Zaynab, in whom the love between the main characters is reflected. It is Zayn who in a dream sees Madjnūn and Laylī united in paradise at the end of the romance."&lt;/ref&gt;

He Persianises&lt;ref name="Gelpke"/&gt; the poem by adding several techniques borrowed from the Persian epic tradition, such as the portrayal of characters, the relationship between characters, description of time and setting, etc.&lt;ref&gt;Ali Asghar Seyed-Gohrab, "Layli and Majnun: Madness and Mystic Longing" Brill Studies in Middle Eastern literature, Jun. 2003, pp. 76–77, excerpt: Although Majnun was to some extent a popular figure before Nizami's time, his popularity increased dramatically after the appearance of Nizami's romance. By collecting information from both secular and mystical sources about Majnun, Nizami portrayed such a vivid picture of this legendary lover that all subsequent poets were inspired by him, many of them imitated him and wrote their own versions of the romance. As we shall see in the following chapters, the poet uses various characteristics deriving from ‘Udhrite love poetry and weaves them into his own Persian culture. In other words, Nizami Persianises the poem by adding several techniques borrowed from the Persian epic tradition, such as the portrayal of characters, the relationship between characters, description of time and setting, etc.&lt;/ref&gt; and adapts the disconnected stories to fit the requirements of a Persian romance.&lt;ref name="EIslamLayla"/&gt;

====Eskandar Nameh====
*'''Eskandar-nameh''' (Persian: اسکندرنامه) "The Book of [[Alexander the Great|Alexander]]" (1194) or (1196–1202)

The [[Alexander Romance|Romance of Alexander the Great]]" contains 10,500 distichs.  There are differences of opinion on whether this was Nezami's last epic or the Haft Paykar.&lt;ref name="HaftIranica"/&gt;  The names of its dedicatees are uncertain but the ruler of Ahar, Nosart al-Din Bishkin b. Mohammad has been mentioned.&lt;ref name="eskandar"/&gt;  The story is based on Islamic myths developed about Alexander the Great, which derive from [[Qur'an]]ic references to the Dhu'l-Qarnayn as well as from the Greek Alexander romance of [[Pseudo-Callisthenes]]. It consists of two books, Sharaf-Nama and Iqbal-nameh. The poem narrates the three stages in Alexander's life: first as the conqueror of the world; then as a seeker after knowledge, gaining enough wisdom to acknowledge his own ignorance; and finally as a prophet, traveling once again across the world, from west to east, and south to north to proclaim his monotheistic creed to the world at large.&lt;ref name="IranicaClassical"/&gt;  The Sharaf-nama discusses the birth of Alexander, his succession to the throne of Rum (Greece), his wars against Africans who invaded Egypt, his conquest of Persia and his marriage to the daughter of Darius.  The episode also discusses Alexander's pilgrimage to [[Mecca]], his stay in the Caucasus and his visit to Queen Nushaba of Barda' and her court of Amazons.  Alexander conquers India, China and the land of the Rus.  The Sharafnama concludes with Alexander's unsuccessful search for the water of immortal life.&lt;ref name="eskandar"/&gt;

The Iqbal-nameh is a description of Alexander's personal growth into the ideal ruler on a model ultimately derived, through Islamic intermediaries, from [[Plato]]'s [[Republic]].&lt;ref name="eskandar"/&gt;  He has debates with Greek and Indian philosophers (c.f. with [[Asadi Tusi|Garshaspnama]]) and a major portion of the text is devoted to the discourses he has with seven Greek sages.   The poet then tells of Alexander's end and adds an account of the circumstances of the death of each of the seven sages.&lt;ref name="eskandar"/&gt;  Nezami's image of Alexander is that of an Iranian&lt;ref name="EncyclopediaIslamEskandar"&gt;
Abel, A. (1978), “Eskandar nāma”, Encyclopaedia of Islam, New Ed., vol. 4:127–129.  Online: Abel, A.; Ed(s). "Iskandar Nama." Encyclopaedia of Islam. Edited by: P. Bearman, Th. Bianquis, C.E. Bosworth, E. van Donzel and W.P. Heinrichs. Brill, 2007. Brill onlien edition). Excerpt: "In the Shahnama, Firdawsi already makes Iskandar  an exemplary figure, whom the companionship of Aristotle helps to rise still higher, by the path of wisdom and moderation, in the direction of abstinence and contempt for this world. And Firdwasi laid stress on the defeat of Dārā (the Darius of the Greeks) as something desired by "the rotation of the Heavens"....At the time of Niẓami, however, Islam is from then onwards well established in Iran, and it is the prophetic and ecumenical aspect of his destiny that the poet makes evident in his hero. As a learned Iranian poet, Niẓami, who demonstrates his eclecticism in the information he gives (he says, "I have taken from everything just what suited me and I have borrowed from recent histories, Christian, Pahlavi and Jewish ... and of them I have made a whole"), locates the story of his hero principally in Iran.  He makes him the image of the Iranian "knight", peace-loving and moderate, courteous and always ready for any noble action. Like all Niẓami's heroes, he conquers the passions of the flesh, and devotes his attention to his undertakings and his friendships. These features appear in the account, which follows ancient tradition, of his conduct towards the women of the family of Darius, in his brotherly attitude on the death of that ruler, in his behaviour towards queen Nushaba (the Kaydaf of Firdawsi, the Kandake of the pseudo-Callisthenes) whom he defends against the Russians.&lt;/ref&gt; knight.

An English translation of the Sharaf-Nama by [[Henry Wilberforce-Clarke]] was published in 1881 under the title Sikandar Nama e Bara and is available online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://persian.packhum.org/persian/main?url=pf%3Fauth%3D176%26work%3D002 |title=Persian Literature in Translation The Packard Humanities Institute: Eskandar-Nama (The Book of Alexander) |publisher=Persian.packhum.org |date= |accessdate=2014-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Haft Paykar====
{{main|The Seven Beauties (poem)}}
*'''Haft Paykar''' (Persian: هفت پیکر) "[[The Seven Beauties (poem)|The Seven Beauties]]" (1197) (also called Bahram-Nama)
[[File:Brooklyn Museum - Practice Makes Perfect from a "Haft Paikar" of Nizami.jpg|thumbnail|left|''Practice Makes Perfect'' from a [[Haft Paikar]] of Nizami. [[Brooklyn Museum]].]]
A pre-Islamic story of Persian&lt;ref name="ChelkowskiEskandar"/&gt; origin, it was dedicated to the ruler of Maragha, 'Ala' Al-Din korp Arslan. It is the story of [[Bahram Gur|Bahram V]], the [[Sassanid Empire|Sassanid]] king, who is born to [[Yazdegerd I|Yazdegerd]] after twenty years of childlessness and supplication to [[Ahura Mazda]] for a child.  The Haft Paykar is a romanticized biography of the Sasanian Persian empire ruler [[Bahram Gur]].&lt;ref name="HaftIranica"/&gt;  His adventurous life had already been treated by [[Ferdowsi]] in the [[Shahnama]], to which fact Nezami alludes a number of times.&lt;ref name="Oxford"/&gt; In general, his method is to omit those episodes that the earlier poet had treated, or to touch on them only very briefly, and to concentrate on new material.&lt;ref name="HaftIranica"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/haft-peykar |title=HAFT PEYKAR – Encyclopaedia Iranica |publisher=Iranicaonline.org |date= |accessdate=2014-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The poet starts by giving an account of the birth of [[Bahram Gur]] and his upbringing in the court of the Arab King No'man and his fabled palace Khwarnaq.  Bahram whose upbringing is entrusted to Nom'man becomes a formidable huntsman.  While wandering through the fabled palace, he discovers a locked room which contains a depiction of seven princesses; hence the name Haft Paykar (seven beauties).  Each of these princesses is from the seven different climes (traditional [[Zoroastrian]]-Islamic division of the Earth) and he falls in love with them.  His father [[Yazdegerd I]] passes away and [[Bahram Gur|Bahram]] returns to Persia to claim his throne from pretenders.  After some episodes he is recognized as King and rescues the Persians from a famine.  Once the country is stable, the King searches for the seven princesses and wins them as his brides.  His architect is ordered to construct seven domes for each of his new brides.  The architect tells him that each of the seven climes is ruled by one of the seven planets (classical planetary system of Zoroastrian-Islamic world) and advises him to assure good fortune by adorning each dome with the color that is associated with each clime and planet.  [[Bahram Gur|Bahram]] is skeptical but follows the advice of the architect.  The princesses take up residence in the splendid pavilions.  On each visit, the king visits the princesses on successive days of the week; on Saturday the Indian princess, who is governed by Saturn and so on.  The princesses names are Furak (Nurak), the daughter of the Rajah of India, as beautiful as the moon; Yaghma Naz, the daughter of the [[Khaqan]] of the Turks; Naz Pari, the daughter of the king of [[Chorasmia|Khwarazm]]; Nasrin Nush, the daughter of the king of the Slavs; Azarbin (Azareyon), the daughter of the king of Morocco; Humay, the daughter of the Roman Caesar; and Diroste (wholesome), a beautiful Iranian princess from the House of Kay Ka'us.  Each princess relates to the king a story matching the mood of her respective color.&lt;ref name="HaftIranica"/&gt;  These seven beautifully constructed, highly sensuous stories occupy about half of the whole poem.&lt;ref name="HaftIranica"/&gt;  While the king is busy with the seven brides, his evil minister seizes power in the realm.  [[Bahram Gur]] discovers that the affairs of Persia are in disarray, the treasury is empty and the neighboring rulers are posed to invade.  He clears his mind first by going hunting.  After returning from hunt, he sees a suspended dog from a tree.  The owner of the dog, who was shepherd, tells the story of how his faithful watchdog had betrayed his flock to a she-wolf in return for sexual favors.&lt;ref name="HaftIranica"/&gt;  He starts investigating the corrupt minister and from the multitude of complaints, he selects seven who tell him the injustice they have suffered.  The minister is subsequently put to death and [[Bahram Gur]] restores justice and orders the seven pleasure-domes to be converted to [[fire temple]]s&lt;ref name="HaftIranica"/&gt; for the pleasure of God.  Bahram then goes hunting for the last time but mysteriously disappears.  As a pun on words, while trying to hunt the wild ass (''gūr'') he instead finds his tomb (''gūr'').&lt;ref name="HaftIranica"/&gt;

Ritter, in his introduction to the critical edition describes it as: "the best and most beautiful epic in New Persian poetry and at the same time . . . one of the most important poetical creations of the whole of oriental Indo-European literature".&lt;ref name="HaftIranica"/&gt;  The Haft Paykar is considered the poet's masterpiece.&lt;ref name="Oxford"/&gt;  Overall, in this masterpiece, Nezami illustrates the harmony of the universe, the affinity of the sacred and the profane, and the concordance of ancient and Islamic Iran.&lt;ref name="EncyclopediaIslam"/&gt;

The story was translated to English in 1924 by Charles Edward Wilson.&lt;ref&gt;The Haft paikar [Engl.], Wilson, Charles Edward, London: Probsthain. 1924. (Probsthain's Oriental series.). {{ISBN|0-85382-017-1}} (see [https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/0853820171 Amazon])&lt;/ref&gt;  A newer English rendering based on more complete manuscripts was accomplished by Professor Julia Scott Meysami.&lt;ref name="Oxford" /&gt;

The evil-natured man keeps faith with none; the erring nature does not fail to err.
The scorpion since it is by nature bad—to let it live's a fault, to kill it, good.
Seek knowledge, for through knowledge you effect that doors to you be opened and not closed.

==Influence and legacy==
[[File:Nizami Gəncəvinin məqbərəsi.jpg|thumb|[[Nizami Mausoleum]] in [[Ganja (city)|Ganja]], [[Azerbaijan]].]]

===Persian culture===
The influence of Neẓāmi's work on the subsequent development of Persian&lt;ref name="Parraello"&gt;Domenico Parrello, "ḴAMSA OF NEẒĀMI" in Encyclopaedia Iranica&lt;/ref&gt;
literature has been enormous and the Khamsa became a pattern that was emulated in later Persian poetry (and also in other Islamic literatures).&lt;ref name="Parraello"/&gt;  The legacy of Nezami is widely felt in the Islamic world and his poetry has influenced the development of Persian, Arabic, Turkish, Kurdish and Urdu poetry amongst many other languages.

In Persian miniature, the stories in Nezami's poems alongside those of Ferdowsi's Shahnama have been the most frequently illustrated literary works.&lt;ref name="Parraello"/&gt;
According to the Encyclopædia Britannica: ''Nezami is admired in Persian-speaking lands for his originality and clarity of style, though his love of language for its own sake and of philosophical and scientific learning makes his work difficult for the average reader''.&lt;ref name="britannica"/&gt;  Nezami composed his verses in [[Persian language|Persian]]&lt;ref&gt;The Russian philologist Ivan Mikhailovich Steblin-Kamensky, Professor and the Dean of the Oriental Department of Saint Petersburg University comments("Oriental Department is ready to cooperate with the West", Saint Petersburg University newspaper,  № 24—25 (3648—49), 1 November 2003").  http://www.spbumag.nw.ru/2003/24/1.shtml – Accessed February 2008.

(in Russian)  excerpt: "Главным, революционным для отечественной науки результатом этой кампании стало отнесение Низами к поэтам азербайджанским, а его творчества к достижениям азербайджанской литературы, в то время как в мировом востоковедении (а ранее и в советском) доминировал взгляд на него как представителя литературы персидской. Точки зрения, что Низами персидский поэт, и сегодня придерживаются ученые многих стран, в первую очередь — Ирана.".  "...while in the realm of the world Oriental Studies (and prior to this in the Soviet as well), the viewpoint of him as a representative of Persian literature.  The viewpoint that Nezami is a Persian poet is even today held by the scholars of many countries, specially of Iran."&lt;/ref&gt; consider Nezami as a significant [[Persian people|Persian]] poet and hail him as the greatest exponent of romantic epic poetry in [[Persian literature]].&lt;ref&gt;Dr. Lalita Sinha (Universiti Sains Malaysia, Senior Lecturer in Comparative Literature and Comparative Religion). Garden of Love. World Wisdom, Inc, 2008. {{ISBN|1-933316-63-2}}. page: 24. "Hailed by scholars of Persian literature as the greatest exponent of romantic epic poetry in Persian literature (Levy 1969, XI), Nizami is also referred...."&lt;/ref&gt;

Amongst the many notable poets who have taken the Five Treasures of Nezami as their model may be mentioned [[Amir Khusro]], Jalal Farahani, [[Khwaju Kermani]], Mohammad Katebi Tarr-Shirini, Abdul Rahman [[Jami]], Hatefi Jami, [[Vahshi Bafqi]], Maktabi Shirazi, [[Ali-Shir Nava'i]], [[Abdul-Qader Bedil|Abdul Qader-e Bedel Dehlavi]], [[Fuzûlî]], Hashemi Kermani, Fayzi, Jamali&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/kamsa-ye-jamali |title=ḴAMSA-ye JAMĀLI – Encyclopaedia Iranica |publisher=Iranicaonline.org |date= |accessdate=2014-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Ahmad Khani]].{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}  Not only poets, but historians such as Rawandi were also influenced by Nezami's poetry and used his poem in rendering history.  Besides these, scores of poets have started their composition with the first line of the Makhzan al-Asrar.

According to Dr. Rudolf Gelpke: ''Many later poets have imitated Nizami's work, even if they could not equal and certainly not surpass it; Persians, Turks, Indians, to name only the most important ones.  The Persian scholar Hekmat has listed not less than forty Persians and thirteen Turkish versions'' of Layli and Majnun.&lt;ref name="Gelpke"/&gt;

According to Vahid Dastgerdi, ''If one would search all existing libraries, one would probably find more than 1000 versions of Layli and Majnun''.

[[Jami]] in his Nafahatol Ons remarks that:  ''Although most of Nezami's work on the surface appear to be romance, in reality they are a mask for the essential truths and for the explanation of divine knowledge''.

[[Jami]] in his Baharestan mentions that: ''Nezami's excellence is more manifest than the sun and has no need of description''.  Hashemi of Kerman remarks: ''The empire of poetry obtained its law and order from Nezami's beautiful verses'' and ''To present words before Nezami's silent speech is a waste of time''.

[[Amir Khusro]] writes:&lt;br&gt;
"The ruler of the kingdom of words, famed hero,&lt;br&gt;
Scholar and poet, his goblet [glass] toasts.&lt;br&gt;
In it – pure wine, it's drunkingly sweet,&lt;br&gt;
Yet in goblet [glass] beside us – only muddy setting."

===Western reception===
[[File:Nizami Museum of Azerbaijan Literature, Baku, 2015.jpg|thumb|[[Nizami Museum of Azerbaijani Literature]] in [[Baku]], [[Azerbaijan]].]]

[[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]] writes:&lt;br&gt;
''A gentle, highly gifted spirit, who, when [[Ferdowsi]] had completed the collected heroic traditions, chose for the material of his poems the sweetest encounters of the deepest love.  Majnun and Layli, Khosrow and Shirin, lovers he presented; meant for one another by premonition, destiny, nature, habit, inclination, passion staunchly devoted to each other; but divided by mad ideas, stubbornness, chance, necessity, and force, then miraculously reunited, yet in the end again in one way or another torn apart and separated from each other.''

With regards to the recitation of his poetry, Peter Chelkowski states: "The memorization and recitation of their literary heritage has alway beens vital to Iranians, whose attitude towards the power of the written and spoken word is revential.  Even today the national passion for poetry is constantly expressed over radio and television, in teahouses, in literary societies, in daily conversation, and in the Musha'areh, the poetry recitation contest. Nizami's work serves as a vehicle and a symbol of this tradition, for it unites universality with deep-rooted artistic endeavor, a sense of justice and passion for the arts and sciences with spirituallity and genuine piety. for richness and fineness of metaphor, accuracy, and profundity of psychological observation, and sheer virtuosity of storytelling, Nizami is unequalled".&lt;ref name="ChelkowskiMirror"/&gt;

Nezami's story of Layla and Majnun also provided the namesake for a hit single by [[Eric Clapton]], also called "[[Layla (song)|Layla]]".  Recorded with [[Derek and the Dominos]], "Layla" was released on the 1970 album ''[[Layla and Other Assorted Love Songs]]''.  The album was highly influenced by Nezami and his poetry of unrequited love.  The fifth song of ''Layla and Other Assorted Love Songs'', "I Am Yours", was in fact a Nezami composition, set to music by Clapton.

In 2004, there was a conference on Nezami organized in the [[University of Cambridge]].  The book containing the proceedings of this conference was published under the title: "Nizami: A Key to the Treasure of Hakim " in 2011 by Leiden Press.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Johan Christoph |last1=Burgel |first2=Christine |last2=van Ruyuymbeke |title=Nizami: A Key to the Treasure of the Hakim |publisher= Amsterdam University Press |year=2011 |url={{Google books |plainurl=yes |id=z5YccgAACAAJ }} }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Nomadic Theatre''' is a co-curricular, student-led theatre group at [[Georgetown University]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] in the [[United States]]. Focused on being "technically ambitious and socially engaged," it is dedicated to producing new works that have an aspect of [[social awareness]] and using the theatre process to allow students to learn about theatre.&lt;ref name=charter&gt;{{cite web|title=Nomadic Charter|url=http://studentorgs.georgetown.edu/nomadic/?Action=Documents}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group takes its name from its history of having no permanent theatre to work in. 

The group produces three main stage shows a year, usually performed in the Walsh [[Black box theater|Black Box]] (no longer in use), the Village C Theatre, or the Devine Theatre in the Davis Performing Arts Center in the center of Georgetown's campus. Main stage shows are directed, produced, acted, designed largely by students.  Often students in large roles such as [[Theatre director|director]], [[Theatrical producer|producer]], or designer, will have an assistant who they train to be able to perform that role on a future show.

The group also produces "Square Pegs", opportunities for students to get involved in theatre without a large time commitment. These have a much shorter rehearsal process and have minimal technical elements and are often performed in the open air amphitheatre in Red Square or in Bulldog Alley in the Leavey Center.

==History==
Nomadic was created in 1982 under the name "D&amp;B Productions" by a group of members from the [[Mask &amp; Bauble Dramatic Society]] (M&amp;B) who were tired of the [[Shakespeare]] and traditional theatre that M&amp;B was known for.&lt;ref name=austin&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=[[The Hoya]]||last=Austin|first=Claire|title=Student Theatre Brings Service to the Stage|url=http://guide.thehoya.com/?q=node/100|accessdate=18 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their first show was ''[[Harvey (play)|Harvey]]'', about a man who befriends an imaginary giant rabbit. The group's second production, "The Fantasticks", shifted its early focus to musical theater. The name "Nomadic Theatre" was not used by the group until the spring, 1984 show, "Jacques Brel is Alive and Well and Living in Paris", and was adopted because of the administration's unwillingness to allow the group to reserve facilities for fixed rehearsal locations, thus necessitating cast members for any given show to memorize the "standard progression" of locations where rehearsal space would be sought, and walk from one to the next until the evening's location was found. All of the group's belongings, consisting mostly of costume pieces, a few props, and a complete tool set purchased through the Roy Rogers restaurant points collection game, were kept in a closet illegally occupied by it in the basement of Xavier Hall. During the early years of the group, it produced a series of musical productions ("Jacques Brel...", the Jones and Schmidt musical "Philemon", "A Night in the Ukraine", "Sweeney Todd",  "What's a Nice Country Like You Doing In A State Like This?" and "Evita") before changing to a non-musical focus.

In 2005 a new building, the Davis Performing Arts Center (DPAC), was constructed. Nomadic and other theatre groups on campus were able to use the advanced scene shop and costume shop for working on their shows, but the building's theatre spaces were to be reserved mainly for faculty directed shows.&lt;ref name=cooke&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=[[The Hoya]]|last=Cooke|first=Meredith|title=Davis Access Limited for Some Student Actors|url=http://thehoya.com/news/davis-access-limited-for-some-student-actors/|accessdate=18 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in March 2006, Nomadic Theatre were able to teamed up with the Department of Performing Arts at Georgetown for the first student production ever staged in the Devine Theatre of the building.&lt;ref name=cooke/&gt;&lt;ref name=curran&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=[[The Hoya]]|last=Curran|first=Allison|title=Guide Coverage of Play Unsatisfactory|url=http://thehoya.com/opinion/guide-coverage-of-play-unsatisfactory/|accessdate=16 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, Nomadic became the first group to have a full-scale, student-run show in the Devine, with ''[[Translations (play)|Translations]]''.  Since then Nomadic has regularly performed in the building.

In the Spring of 2010 members of Nomadic Theatre were instrumental in the organization of Hate-Free Georgetown, a week-long celebration to "promote unity and respect on campus".&lt;ref name=barber&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=[[The Hoya]]|last=Barber|first=Kevin|title=A Year of Pain and Progress for LGBTQ Georgetown|url=http://thehoya.com/news/year-pain-and-progress-lgbtq-georgetown102/|accessdate=16 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''operating agreement''' is a key document used by [[limited liability company|LLCs]] because it outlines the business' financial and functional decisions including rules, regulations and provisions. The purpose of the document is to govern the internal operations of the business in a way that suits the specific needs of the business owners. Once the document is signed by the members of the limited liability company, it acts as an official contract binding them to its terms. Many states in the United States require an LLC to have an operating agreement. LLCs operating without an operating agreement are governed by the state's default rules contained in the relevant [[statute]] and developed through state court decisions. An operating agreement is similar in function to [[by-laws|corporate by-laws]], or analogous to a [[partnership agreement]] in multi-member LLCs. In single-member LLCs, an operating agreement is a declaration of the structure that the member has chosen for the company and sometimes used to prove in court that the LLC structure is separate from that of the individual owner and thus necessary so that the owner has documentation to prove that he or she is indeed separate from the entity itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sba.gov/blogs/basic-information-about-operating-agreements|title=Basic Information About Operating Agreements {{!}} The U.S. Small Business Administration {{!}} SBA.gov|website=www.sba.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most states do not require operating agreements. However, an operating agreement is highly recommended for multi-member LLCs because it structures an LLC's finances and organization, and provides rules and regulations for smooth operation. The operating agreement usually includes percentage of interests, allocation of profits and losses, member's rights and responsibilities and other provisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sba.gov/starting-business/choose-your-business-structure/limited-liability-company|title=Limited Liability Company (LLC) {{!}} The U.S. Small Business Administration {{!}} SBA.gov|website=www.sba.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Operating agreements are legally significant. Having a correctly drafted operating agreement is crucial in case legal disputes arise between business owners.{{cn|date=October 2017}}

'''Paracopyright''' ("pseudocopyright" or "metacopyright") is legal protection above and beyond traditional [[copyright]]. The most often cited example is "legal protection for technical measures" from the 1996 [[World Intellectual Property Organization|WIPO]] Internet treaties. Paracopyright provisions in these treaties are not about the term or scope of copyright, but instead are about providing legal protections for the technologies that may be used by copyright holders. 

Paracopyrights afford legal protection to technologies that claim to be used to protect copyrights, but that are ineffective in that goal. A technical measure can not stop a technically sophisticated person who wishes to infringe copyright.  To use the "digital locks" analogy, there is no need to "pick the lock" as the keys necessary to decode the content are embedded within authorized access technology.  Both the locked content and the technology containing the key are commercially available to an infringer.  Once a single person decodes a technical measure, the decoded content can be made available to others in the same way as if the technical measure never existed.

The effect of these technical measures are to impose specific contractual [[license agreement]]s on those conforming to copyright law. As a concept, therefore, paracopyrights are perhaps better understood as a part of [[contract law]] and not copyright law. Unfortunately, important regulations regarding consumer protection and the "freedom to contract" are not imported directly into paracopyright laws, potentially creating imbalances in the law and harmful [[unintended consequence]]s.

Copyright is traditionally understood as a statutorily defined [[Bundle of rights|bundle of exclusive rights]] provided to copyright holders. An [[Copyright infringement|infringement of copyright]] takes place when someone exercises one or more of the copyright holder’s exclusive rights without his or her permission. Anti-circumvention and anti-device provisions do not fit under this paradigm of a bundle of exclusive rights. On one hand, a copyright owner has the exclusive right to copy his or her work, and that exclusive right is infringed when someone else copies the work without permission. It is quite another story, however, to think about copyright holders having the exclusive right to circumvent TPMs ([[Technical Protection Measure]]) that they apply to their works, and the exclusive right to make and distribute devices that enable or facilitate circumvention of TPMs.  Even assuming that this problem could be overcome, attempting to force anti-circumvention and anti-device provisions to fit the mold of the [[bundle of rights]] paradigm seems to necessitate adding a number of related rights to the bundle, including the exclusive right to apply a TPM to a copyright work.

'''''Policraticus''''' was the first book of [[political science]] to be produced during the [[Middle Ages]]. Written by [[John of Salisbury]] around 1159, it belongs to the genre of advice literature known as "[[Mirrors for princes|mirrors for princes"]], and is addressed to the territorial ruler. Though it takes up a wide variety of ethical questions, it is most famous for attempting to define the responsibilities of [[Monarch|kings]] and their relationship to their subjects. 

==Definitions==
Policraticus is a pseudo [[Greco-Roman world|Greco-Roman]] [[neologism]] term, meaning "the statesman." Salisbury drew his arguments from several different sources, including the [[Bible]] and the [[Justinian Code]]. He argued for the [[divine right of kings]], saying that
&lt;blockquote&gt;
...the prince stands on a pinnacle which is exalted and made splendid with all the great and high privileges which he deems necessary for himself. And rightly so, because nothing is more advantageous to the people than that the needs of the prince should be fully satisfied; since it is impossible that his will should be found opposed to justice. Therefore, according to the usual definition, the prince is the public power, and a kind of likeness on earth of the divine majesty. Beyond doubt a large share of the divine power is shown to be in princes by the fact that at their nod men bow their necks and for the most part offer up their heads to the axe to be struck off, and, as by a divine impulse, the prince is feared by each of those over whom he is set as an object of fear. And this I do not think could be, except as a result of the will of God. For all power is from the Lord God, and has been with Him always, and is from everlasting.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
This divine source allowed princes to wage [[Just War|just wars]] and required all subjects to submit to the prince's will.  Salisbury argued that the prince had four responsibilities: Revere [[God]],  adore his subjects, exert self-discipline and instruct his ministers.  Salisbury advocated strict punishments for [[lèse majesté]], but argued that a prince should err on the side of mercy and compassion when enforcing his laws.

==Tyrannicide==

While recognizing a prince's supreme temporal power, Salisbury argued that princes must be subordinate to the will of God and the Church.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
For myself, I am satisfied and persuaded that loyal shoulders should uphold the power of the ruler; and not only do I submit to his power patiently, but with pleasure, so long as it is exercised in subjection to God and follows His ordinances. But on the other hand if it resists and opposes the divine commandments, and wishes to make me share in its war against God; then with unrestrained voice I answer back that God must be preferred before any man on earth. Therefore inferiors should cleave and cohere to their superiors, and all the limbs should be in subjection to the head; but always and only on condition that religion is kept inviolate.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
In Salisbury's mind, a tyrant sets a poor example for his people and could lead them from God.  His example was the Roman Emperor [[Julian the Apostate]], who attempted to restore Rome's [[Religion in ancient Rome|pagan]] religion.  In this case, Salisbury argued that killing a regent, when all other resources were exhausted, was not only justifiable but necessary, and he called a tyrant an "image of depravity . . . [who] spring(s) from evil and should be cut down with the axe wherever he grows."  This may be the first defense of [[tyrannicide]] to be written after [[classical antiquity|Antiquity]].

{{Hatnote|Not to be confused with ''Polish Professional Writers' Union'' created by [[Stefan Żeromski]], known in [[Polish language|Polish]] as Związek Zawodowy Literatów Polskich.}}

The '''Polish Writers' Union''' or the '''Union of Polish Writers''' ({{lang-pl|Związek Literatów Polskich}}, '''ZLP''') was established at a meeting of Polish writers and activists in [[Lublin]] behind the Soviet front line, during the liberation of [[Poland]] by the [[Red Army]] in 1944. Its initial name (Professional Union of Polish Writers) came from the similar organization formed in 1920 by renowned Polish novelist [[Stefan Żeromski]], called ''Związek Zawodowy Literatów Polskich'' which was deactivated during [[World War II]].&lt;ref name="wiadomosci.wp"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://wiadomosci.wp.pl/kat,1342,title,Nowy-stary-prezes-Zwiazku-Literatow-Polskich,wid,13386712,wiadomosc.html?ticaid=1e760 | title=Nowy-stary prezes Związku Literatów Polskich | publisher=Wirtualna Polska | work=Wiadomości | accessdate=May 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="encyklopedia.pwn"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://encyklopedia.pwn.pl/haslo.php?id=4002321 | title=Związek Literatów Polskich | publisher=Encyklopedia PWN | work=Literatura i sztuka | accessdate=May 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The name was shortened to Polish Writers' Union at the 1949 conference in [[Szczecin]], in order to reflect the new government-imposed policy of [[Socialist realism in Poland]] advanced by the [[History of Poland (1945–1989)#Stalinist era (1948–1956)|Polish communist party]] of that period.&lt;ref name="bookinstitute"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.bookinstitute.pl/en,ik,site,40,78,1334.php | title=Związek Literatów Polskich (ZLP) | publisher=Instytut Książki, Poland | date=2012 | accessdate=May 16, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the following years, the two official organs of ZLP were ''Twórczość'' monthly and the weekly ''Nowa Kultura''. After the [[Polish October|socialist revolution of 1956]] the Union became less of a political arm of the [[Polish United Workers' Party|United Workers' Party]], and more of a true writers' organization devoted to creative output and the well-being of its members.&lt;ref name="portalwiedzy"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://portalwiedzy.onet.pl/61036,,,,zwiazek_literatow_polskich,haslo.html | title=Związek Literatów Polskich, ZLP | publisher=Encyklopedia WIEM | work=Literatura | accessdate=May 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In [[communist Poland]], the ZLP was the only official representation of the country's literary community. In 1980, the Union consisted of 1,349 participants gathered in its 17 regional chapters.&lt;ref name="encyklopedia.pwn"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://encyklopedia.pwn.pl/haslo.php?id=4002321 | title=Związek Literatów Polskich | publisher=Encyklopedia PWN | work=Literatura i sztuka | accessdate=May 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It had an annual budget set by the state with numerous special funds and permits allowing for food [[Dietary supplement|supplement]]s, medical clinics, foreign travel, cars, vacations, [[stipend]]s and cash prizes for the inner circle. Its leaders lived a life of privilege, while some of the writers are known to have worked for [[Ministry of Public Security (Poland)|the secret police]], spying on others.&lt;ref name="klejnocki"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://klejnocki.wydawnictwoliterackie.pl/archiwum/03/2009/2/ | title=Związki pisarzy | publisher=Wydawnictwoliterackie.pl | work=Raptularz końca czasów | accessdate=May 17, 2012 | author=Jarosław Klejnocki}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="historia-zlp"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.literaci.eu/index.php/historia-zlp.html | title=Historia Związku Literatów Polskich | publisher=''ZLP Literaci.eu'', Magazyn Związku Literatów Polskich | work=Homepage | date=March 22, 2007 | accessdate=May 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Martial law in Poland==
On 13 December 1981 the authoritarian government of the [[People's Republic of Poland]] introduced [[Martial law in Poland|martial law]] in an attempt to crush political opposition. Pro-democracy movements such as [[Solidarity]] were banned and their leaders detained. The Union of Polish Writers was suspended. Some of its [[dissident]] members were jailed and dozens blacklisted. At the [[Polish United Workers' Party]] Central Committee meeting the writers loyal to the new regime condemned the leaders of ZLP as disreputable.&lt;ref name="tygodnik.pl"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.przeglad-tygodnik.pl/pl/artykul/pisarz-literat-jednym-stoja-domu | title=Pisarz i literat w jednym stoją domu | publisher=Tygodnik PRZEGLĄD weekly | date=20/2005 | accessdate=May 18, 2012 | author=Helena Kowalik}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Union was disbanded in 1983. It was reinstated the same year by communist hardliners based on a new pledge of loyalty, which caused a deep rift in its highly politicized community. Many former members did not renew their cards.&lt;ref name="portalwiedzy" /&gt;&lt;ref name="tygodnik.pl" /&gt;

After the collapse of the Soviet union in 1989, the ZLP lost its state sponsorship.&lt;ref name="historia-zlp" /&gt; An alternative, new writers' union was also formed, called [[Stowarzyszenie Pisarzy Polskich]] (The Society of Polish Writers). As of now, both organizations have their headquarters at the ''Dom Literatury'' (Literary House) in [[Warsaw]] at ul. [[Krakowskie Przedmieście]] street, in a historic building which they own collectively.&lt;ref name="portalwiedzy" /&gt;&lt;ref name="tygodnik.pl" /&gt;

'''Quirky''' is an invention platform that connects inventors with companies that specialized in a specific product category.&lt;ref name="Quirky"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.quirky.com/about | work=Quirky | title=About | date=3 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Quirky was founded in 2009 by Ben Kaufman.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.adweek.com/news/advertising-branding/quirky-telling-world-just-how-unimportant-its-ceo-158032|title=Quirky Is Telling the World Just How Unimportant Its CEO Is|date=2014-05-30|website=AdWeek|publisher=|access-date=2016-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2010, Quirky received $6.5 million in Series A [[venture capital]] funding, led by RRE Ventures.&lt;ref name="supply chain"&gt;[https://venturebeat.com/2010/04/27/quirky-ben-kaufman/ Quirky's 23-year-old CEO finds love with the supply chain], Paul Boutin, ''VentureBeat'', April 27, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; The company later received a $16 million Series B round in August 2011 led by [[Norwest Venture Partners]], and a $68 million Series C round in September 2012 led by [[Andreessen Horowitz]] and [[Kleiner Perkins Caufield &amp; Byers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://dealbook.nytimes.com/2012/09/07/quirky-gets-backing-from-andreessen-horowitz-and-kleiner-perkins/ | title=Quirky Gets Backing From Andreessen Horowitz and Kleiner Perkins | accessdate=October 17, 2012 | last=Fenn | first=Donna | publisher=New York Times | date=September 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Then, in November 2013, Quirky raised $79 million in Series D funding from GE as well as its venture investors Andreessen Horowitz, Norwest Venture Partners, RRE, and Kleiner Perkins Caufield &amp; Byers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://allthingsd.com/20131113/quirky-funding/|title = Quirky Raises $79M, Including $30M From GE to Make Connected-Home Gadgets|date = November 13, 2013|accessdate = |website = All Things Digital|publisher = |last = Gannes|first = Liz}}&lt;/ref&gt; Part of the deal included a $30 million investment from [[General Electric|GE]], as well as a partnership to build 30 connected-home gadgets together in the next five years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.wired.com/2013/11/how-ge-and-quirky-want-to-smarten-up-your-home/|title = Quirky and GE Partner to Conquer the Internet of Things|date = November 19, 2013|accessdate = |website = Wired|publisher = |last = Stinson|first = Liz}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, a [[reality television]] series named ''Quirky'' debuted on the [[Sundance Channel (United States)|Sundance Channel]] following events at the Quirky office.&lt;ref&gt;[[Associated Press]], "Startup Quirky brings people's ideas to life", ''[[Japan Times]]'', 28 August 2011, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Baptistery of Neon''' (Italian: ''Battistero Neoniano'') is a religious building in [[Ravenna]], central [[Italy]]. The most ancient monument remaining in the city,  it was partly erected on the site of a [[Roman bath]]. It is also called the '''Orthodox Baptistery''' to distinguish it from the [[Arian Baptistery]] constructed on behest of [[Ostrogothic]] King [[Theodoric the Great|Theodoric]] some 50 years later.

The octagonal brick structure was erected by [[Bishop]] Ursus at the end of the 4th or beginning of the 5th century, as part of his great [[Basilica]] (destroyed in 1734). The baptistery was finished by Bishop Neon at the end of the 5th century, at which time the [[mosaic]] decorations were added. The original floor is now some 3 meters underground, so the proper structure and extent of the building can no longer be seen. The octagonal design of the building, employed in virtually all Early Christian baptisteries, symbolizes the seven days of the week plus the Day of the Resurrection and Eternal Life.

The ceiling mosaic depicts [[John the Baptist]] baptizing [[Jesus]] (depicted with beard) standing waist high in the [[Jordan River]]. To one side stands the [[personification]] of the Jordan river, with a reed in one hand and a garment in the other. A procession of the twelve [[Twelve Apostles|apostles]] proceeds around the center mosaic in two directions, ending with [[Saint Peter]] meeting [[Paul of Tarsus|Saint Paul]].
[[Image:Baptistry of Neon ceiling mosaic (Ravenna).jpg|thumb|left|The ceiling mosaic in the Baptistry of Neon]]
The Baptistry is one of the eight structures in Ravenna registered as [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Sites]]. According to the [[ICOMOS]] evaluation of this patrimony, "this is the finest and most complete surviving example of the early Christian [[baptistery]]" which "retains the fluidity in representation of the human figure derived from Greco-Roman art".

[[File:Robat sharaf 1.jpg|250px|right|thumb]]
The '''Ribat-i Sharaf''' (or '''Robat-e Sharaf'''; {{lang-fa|رباط شرف}}) is a [[caravanserai]], or rest place for travellers, located in [[Razavi Khorasan Province]], [[Iran]], between [[Merv]] and [[Nishapur]].  Built in the 12th century (circa 1114), the building looks like a fortified rectangle from the exterior.  The courtyard and four [[Iwan]] floorplan is that of the traditional standard Iranian [[mosque]].  The walls and the ''[[pishtaq]]'' ({{lang|fa|پیشطاق}}), the entrance way inside an iwan, are decorated with vegetal and geometric patterning that function to provide a good example of the "Textile Metaphor" seen in [[Islamic architecture]] of this era.
The caravanserai consists of two inter-related four [[Iwan]] planned courtyards, famous for owning some of the most diverse and beautiful brick decorations in [[Iranian architecture]].

'''Rosa Menkman''' (born 1983) is a Dutch art [[theorist]], [[curator]], and visual artist specialising in [[glitch art]] and [[Image resolution|resolution]] theory. She investigates video compression, feedback, and glitches, using her exploration to generate art works.

Menkman's ''The Collapse of PAL'' (2011), in which she acknowledges the end of [[PAL]] (Phase Alternating Line)—an analogue video programming structure&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.artsy.net/artist/rosa-menkman|title=Rosa Menkman - 2 Artworks, Bio &amp; Shows on Artsy|website=www.artsy.net|access-date=2016-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;—is the digital version of a live audio visual performance first performed on national Danish television and afterward realized at oa. Transmediale (Germany) and Nova festival (Brasil).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.artsy.net/artwork/rosa-menkman-the-collapse-of-pal|title=Rosa Menkman {{!}} The Collapse of PAL (2011) {{!}} Artsy|website=www.artsy.net|access-date=2016-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Menkman has curated several international exhibitions of other artists' work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.furtherfield.org/programmes/exhibition/glitch-momentums | title=Glitch Moment/ums, Furtherfield, 8 June - 28 July 2013 | year=2013 | accessdate=1 June 2014 | author=Menkman, Rosa and Furtherfield}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Glitch art ==

In 2011, Menkman published ''Network Notebook #04: The Glitch Moment(um)''. This book uses information theory to propose an understanding of "[[glitch art]]" as a particular genre of [[contemporary art]]. She argues that the glitch shifts between being an artifact and a process.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://networkcultures.org/blog/publication/no-04-the-glitch-momentum-rosa-menkman/|title=Institute of Network Cultures {{!}} No. 04: The Glitch Moment(um), Rosa Menkman|website=networkcultures.org|access-date=2016-03-17}} http://networkcultures.org/_uploads/NN%234_RosaMenkman.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

She also wrote ''A Vernacular of File Formats''&lt;ref name="aVoFFhman"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.slideshare.net/r00s/rosa-menkman-a-vernacular-of-file-formats-4923967 | title=A Vernacular of File Formats | publisher=Rosa Menkman | author=Menkman, Rosa |date= |website=Slideshare |access-date=26 December 2015 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the ''Glitch Studies Manifesto''&lt;ref name="glitchman"&gt;{{cite book | url=http://networkcultures.org/wpmu/portal/publications/inc-readers/video-vortex-ii/ | title=Video Vortex Reader II: moving images beyond YouTube | publisher=Institute of Network Cultures | author=Menkman, Rosa | article=Glitch Studies Manifesto | year=2011 | location=Amsterdam | pages=336–347 | isbn=9789078146124}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the same year. The manifesto was awarded 'best practice' by Virtueel Platform, then sector institute for [[Internet culture|e-culture]] in the Netherlands.&lt;ref name="vp"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://virtueelplatform.nl/best-practice/glitch-studies-manifesto/ | title=Best Practice / Glitch Studies Manifesto | publisher=Virtueel Platform | accessdate=1 June 2014 | author=Hamers, Eveleen}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The publication of ''Network Notebook #04: The Glitch Moment(um)'' coincided with the [[GLI.TC/H]] festival, organized by Menkman in collaboration with American artists Nick Briz and Jon Satrom. The first GLI.TC/H festival in 2010 (Chicago) was followed by a second and third edition in 2011 (Chicago, Amsterdam, Birmingham) and 2012 (Chicago).&lt;ref name="gli.tc/h"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://gli.tc/h/ | title=GLI.TC/H festival | accessdate=1 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015 Menkman opened the ''institutions of Resolution Disputes'' at [[Transfer Gallery]] in New York City (in reference to [[Dispute resolution]]).&lt;ref name="iRD at Transfer Gallery"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://transfergallery.com/2015/03/ird-rosa-menkman/ | title=Transfer Gallery presents: iRD | accessdate=26 December 2015 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160104043747/http://transfergallery.com/2015/03/ird-rosa-menkman/ | archivedate=4 January 2016 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2015, one of the works in the show, DCT, referencing [[Discrete cosine transform]], was awarded 1st prize at the Crypto Design Challenge hosted by [[Stedelijk Museum Breda|Museum Of The Image]] (MOTI) in Breda, the Netherlands.&lt;ref name="gli"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.motimuseum.nl/en/the-museum/news/award-ceremony-crypto-design-challenge/2529 | title=Award ceremony Crypto Design Challenge | accessdate=26 December 2015 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160307061011/http://www.motimuseum.nl/en/the-museum/news/award-ceremony-crypto-design-challenge/2529 | archivedate=7 March 2016 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''singe''' is a slight scorching, burn or treatment with flame. This may be due to an accident, such as scorching one's hair when lighting a [[gas fire]], or a deliberate method of treatment or removal of hair or other fibres.

==Hairdressing==
A singe is a treatment available at a [[barber]]'s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title= Trade Training and Vocational Guidance|page=241|publisher=Preston School of Industry|year=1943|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MaZAAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=hair+singe+barber&amp;dq=hair+singe+barber|author1= Industry, Preston School of}}&lt;/ref&gt; A lit [[candle|taper]] (candle) or other device is used to lightly burn and shrivel the hair.  The practice of singeing was popular approximately a century ago; it was believed that hair had "fluid" in it and singeing would trap the fluid in.  Singeing is supposed to have beneficial effects – sealing cut ends, closing up the [[Hair follicle|follicle]]s, preventing the hair from bleeding (This belief has since been debunked.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Medical Art and Indianapolis Medical Journal|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=v7lXAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA171|year=1918|pages=171–}}&lt;/ref&gt;) and encouraging it to grow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Zone Reflex Plus Translation Diet: Hydro-Therapy and Swedish Massage|page=74|author1=Joe S. Riley |author2=W. E. Daglish |year=1996|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8ST9Zc8TB54C|isbn=0-7873-1124-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Singeing is still sometimes used to bond natural hair to [[hair extensions]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Ayana Byrd|author2=Lori Tharps|title=Hair Story: Untangling the Roots of Black Hair in America|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jpdqmtO2IycC&amp;pg=PA122|date=12 January 2002|publisher=St. Martin's Press|isbn=978-0-312-28322-3|pages=122–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Primitive cultures have also used singeing as a means to trim scalp or body hair, as a part of normal grooming or during ritual activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Bret Harte|title=The Overland Monthly|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EPYAAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA419|year=1874|publisher=A.

[[Francis Drake|Sir Francis Drake]] was famously said to have figuratively "[[singed the King of Spain's beard]]" when he [[Francis Drake#Cadiz raid|raided Cadiz]] and burnt the Spanish fleet.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Management of the Hirsute Woman|author=Jocelyn R.

==Agriculture==
In the [[agricultural industry]], [[poultry]] and [[pork]] is singed to remove stub [[feather]]s and [[bristle]]s. Kiwifruit vine leaders and canes are sometimes cauterised as a treatment for ''[[Pseudomonas syringae]]'' bacterial infection.

In the [[textile industry]], loose fibres protruding on the surface of [[textile]] goods are singed to remove them.  When done to [[textile|fabric]]s containing [[cotton]], this results in increased wettability, better [[dyeing]] characteristics, improved reflection, no "frosty" appearance, a smoother surface, better clarity in printing, improved visibility of the fabric structure, less [[Pill (textile)|pilling]] and decreased contamination through removal of fluff and lint.

The process is usually to pass one or both sides of a fabric over a gas flame to burn off the protruding fibres. Other methods include [[infra-red]] or heat for [[thermoplastic]] fibers. Singeing of [[yarn]]s is called "''gassing''".  It is usually the first step after [[weaving]] or [[knitting]], though the fabric may be brushed first to raise the surface fibres.

Cellulose fibres such as cotton are easily singed because the protruding fibers burn to a light ash which is easily removed. Thermoplastic fibres are harder to singe because they melt and form hard residues on the fabric surface.

'''''The Prince’s Dream''''' is a fable written by [[Jean Ingelow]] as part of ''The Wonderbox Tales'' collection. The story is a tale of a [[prince]] living in seclusion within a far-off tower filled with many luxuries, in Southern Asia ([[India]]).  The story focuses on his encounter with an old man, who comes to the prince in a [[dream]] and offers a view of what the ‘outside world’ is truly about. This encounter shapes the prince’s view of the outside world, as well as his developing views on morality and the importance and reason of life. 

==Synopsis==
A young prince, who is raised from [[infancy]] in a large tower, has been brought up in a world of luxuries, decadence, but is also brought up without a sense of the true worth of money and material goods. He is brought up with many slaves, companions and attendants, but has never set foot outside the tower. Everything the Prince knows about the world comes from the stories and tales that his slaves and attendants, who are replaced over and over again, have told him. 

The Prince believes that he knows what is going on outside the tower thanks to these stories until one day, a new man arrives at the tower. The newcomer, an old man, begins to discuss what is happening in the 'outside world' and about what the meaning of “[[gold]]” is and what having wealth truly means.  At first, being exposed to nothing but luxury his whole life, the young Prince focuses on the importance of gold in the world. But he later realizes through a dream that gold and luxuries are not as important as hard work, charity, empathy and ethics. The danger of gold and greed is revealed to the Prince when he realizes the importance of work and charity after seeing the people in his dream torn apart by avarice. Upon waking, the Prince suddenly understands the implications of putting too much importance on material things. Upon realizing this, the old man disappears, leaving the Prince with a humbling perspective about the world around him.&lt;!-- did he free the slaves?--&gt;

In broad terms, '''transformation design''' is a human-centered, interdisciplinary process that seeks to create desirable and sustainable changes in behavior and form – of individuals, systems and organizations – often for socially progressive ends.

It is a multi-stage, iterative process applied to big, complex issues – often social issues.

Its practitioners examine problems holistically rather than reductively to understand relationships as well as components to better frame the challenge.   They then prototype small-scale systems – composed of objects, services, interactions and experiences – that support people and organizations in achievement of a desired change.  Successful prototypes are then scaled.

Because transformation design is about applying design skills in non-traditional territories, it often results in non-traditional design outputs.&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;   Projects have resulted in the creation of new roles, new organizations, new systems and new policies.  These designers are just as likely to shape a job description, as they are a new product.&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;

This emerging field draws from a variety of design disciplines - [[service design]], [[user-centered design]], [[participatory design]], [[concept design]], [[information design]], [[industrial design]], [[graphic design]], [[systems design]], [[interactive design]], [[experience design]] - as well as non-design disciplines including [[cognitive psychology]] and [[perceptual psychology]], [[linguistics]], [[cognitive science]], [[architecture]], [[Haptic communication|haptics]], [[information architecture]], [[ethnography]], [[storytelling]] and [[heuristics]].

==History==

Though academics have written about the economic value of and need for transformations over the years&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;,8&lt;/sup&gt;, its practice first emerged in 2004 when [http://www.designcouncil.org.uk/  The Design Council], the UK’s national strategic body for design, formed [https://web.archive.org/web/20071012025011/http://www.designcouncil.info/RED/ RED]:  a self-proclaimed “do-tank” challenged to bring design thinking to the transformation of public services.&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;

This move was in response to Prime Minister Tony Blair’s desire to have public services “redesigned around the needs of the user, the patients, the passenger, the victim of crime.”&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;

The RED team, led by [[Hilary Cottam]], studied these big, complex problems to determine how design thinking and design techniques could help government rethink the systems and structures within public services and possibly redesign them from beginning to end.&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;

Between 2004 and 2006, the RED team, in collaboration with many other people and groups, developed techniques, processes and outputs that were able to “transform” social issues such as preventing illness, managing chronic illnesses, senior citizen care, rural transportation, energy conservation, re-offending prisoners and public education.

In 2015 Braunschweig University of Art / Germany has launched a new MA in [http://www.hbk-bs.de/studiengaenge/transformation-design/ Transformation Design]. In 2016 The Glasgow School of Art Launched another masters program "M.Des in Design Innovation and Transformation Design".

==Process==

Transformation design, like user-centered design, starts from the perspective of the end user.  Designers spend a great deal of time not only learning how users currently experience the system and how they want to experience the system, but also co-creating with them the designed solutions.

Because transformation design tackles complex issues involving many stakeholders and components, more expertise beyond the user and the designer is always required.  People such as, but not limited to, policy makers, sector analysts, psychologists, economists, private businesses, government departments and agencies, front-line workers and academics are invited to participate in the entire design process - from problem definition to solution development.&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;

With so many points-of-view brought into the process, transformation designers are not always ‘designers.’ Instead, they often play the role of moderator.   Though varying methods of participation and co-creation, these moderating designers create hands-on, collaborative workshops (a.k.a. [[charrette]]) that make the design process accessible to the non-designers.

Ideas from workshops are rapidly prototyped and beta-tested in the real world with a group of real end users.  Their experience with and opinions of the prototypes are recorded and fed back into the workshops and development of the next prototype.

'''Trina Robbins''' (born Trina Perlson, 1938)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Riesman |first1=Abraham |title=The Story of Trina Robbins, the Controversial Feminist Who Revolutionized Comic Books |url=http://www.vulture.com/2018/04/meet-trina-robbins-the-feminist-who-revolutionized-comics.html |work=Vulture |date=18 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an [[People of the United States|American]] cartoonist. She was an early and influential participant in the [[underground comix]] movement, and one of the first few female artists in that movement. Both as a cartoonist and historian, Robbins has long been involved in creating outlets for and promoting female comics artists. In the 1980s, Robbins became the first woman to draw ''[[Wonder Woman]]'' comics. She is a member of the [[Will Eisner Hall of Fame]].

==Career==

=== Early work ===
Robbins was an active member of [[science fiction fandom]] in the 1950s and 1960s. Her illustrations appeared in [[science fiction fanzines]] like the [[Hugo Award|Hugo]]-[[Hugo Award for Best Fanzine|nominated]] [[Habakkuk (fanzine)|''Habakkuk'']].

=== Comics ===
Robbins' first comics were printed in the ''[[East Village Other]]''; she also contributed to the spin-off underground comic ''[[Gothic Blimp Works]]''.

In 1969, Robbins designed the costume for the [[Warren Publishing]] character [[Vampirella]], for artist [[Frank Frazetta]] in ''Vampirella'' #1 (Sept. 1969).&lt;ref name=arndt&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.enjolrasworld.com/Richard%20Arndt/The%20Warren%20Magazines%20Index%20Only.htm | first=Richard J.|last=Arndt|title=The Warren Magazines| publisher=EnjolrasWorld.com | date = September 22, 2008| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110710194128/http://enjolrasworld.com/Richard%20Arndt/The%20Warren%20Magazines%20Index%20Only.htm| archivedate=July 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She left New York for [[San Francisco]] in 1970, where she worked at the feminist [[underground newspaper]] ''It Ain't Me, Babe''. That same year she, along with fellow female artist [[Barbara "Willy" Mendes]], established the first all-woman comic book, the [[One-shot (comics)|one-shot]] [[It Ain't Me, Babe (comic)|''It Ain't Me, Babe Comix'']].&lt;ref name="Krensky74"&gt;Krensky, p. 74.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Kaplan79&gt;Kaplan, p. 79.&lt;/ref&gt; From this period on, Robbins became increasingly involved in creating outlets for and promoting female comics artists, through projects such as the [[comics anthology]] ''[[Wimmen's Comix]]'', with which she was involved for twenty years. ''Wimmen's Comix'' #1 featured Robbins' "Sandy Comes Out", the first-ever comic strip featuring an "out" [[lesbian]].&lt;ref&gt;Kaplan, Arie. ''Masters of the Comic Book Universe Revealed!''. (Chicago Review Press, 2006) {{ISBN|1-55652-633-4}}, p.86.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bernstein, Robin (July 31, 1994). "Where Women Rule: The World of Lesbian Cartoons". ''The Harvard Gay &amp; Lesbian Review'' 1 (3): 20.&lt;/ref&gt;

Robbins became increasingly outspoken in her beliefs, criticizing underground comix artist [[Robert Crumb]] for the perceived misogyny of many of his comics. She said, "It's weird to me how willing people are to overlook the hideous darkness in Crumb's work&amp;nbsp;... What the hell is funny about rape and murder?"&lt;ref name="Sabin-92"&gt;Sabin, Roger (1996). "Going underground". ''Comics, Comix &amp; Graphic Novels: A History Of Comic Art''. London, United Kingdom: Phaidon Press. pp. 92. {{ISBN|0-7148-3008-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1980s Robbins created adaptations of [[Sax Rohmer]]'s ''Dope'' and [[Tanith Lee]]'s ''[[The Silver Metal Lover]]''. In the mid-1980s she wrote and drew ''Misty'' for the [[Marvel Comics]] children's imprint [[Star Comics]]. The short-lived series was a reinterpretation of the long-standing character [[Millie the Model]], now an adult running her own modeling agency and minding her niece Misty.

Robbins' official involvement with [[Wonder Woman]], a character she had long admired, began in 1986. At the conclusion of the first volume of the series (in conjunction with the series ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]''), [[DC Comics]] published a four-issue [[Limited series (comics)|limited series]] titled ''The Legend of Wonder Woman'', written by [[Kurt Busiek]] and drawn by Robbins. Robbins was the first woman to draw Wonder Woman comics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Ultra Nerdy |url=http://blogs.vancouversun.com/2014/11/05/trina-robbins-wonder-woman-comics/ |title=Q &amp; A with Trina Robbins – first woman to draw Wonder Woman comics (with video) &amp;#124; Vancouver Sun |publisher=Blogs.vancouversun.com |date=2014-11-05 |accessdate=2017-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The series paid homage to the character's [[Golden Age of Comic Books|Golden Age]] roots. She also appeared as herself in ''Wonder Woman Annual 2'' (1989). In the mid-1990s, Robbins criticized artist [[Mike Deodato]]'s "[[bad girl art]]" portrayal of Wonder Woman, calling Deodato's version of the character a "barely clothed hypersexual [[pin-up girl|pinup]]."&lt;ref&gt;Trina Robbins, ''The Great Women Superheroes'' (Kitchen Sink Press, 1996) {{ISBN|0-87816-481-2}}, p. 166.&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 1990s, Robbins collaborated with [[Colleen Doran]] on the [[DC Comics]] graphic novel ''Wonder Woman: The Once and Future Story'', on the subject of [[spousal abuse]].

Robbins has been writing the comic book adventures of [[Honey West]], notable as being one of popular fiction's first female [[private detective]]s.

=== Writing and activism ===
In addition to her comics work, Robbins is an author of nonfiction books on the history of women in cartooning.

Her first book, co-written with [[Catherine Yronwode]], was ''Women and the Comics,'' a history of female comic-strip and comic-book creators. As one of the first books ever published on this subject, it was covered in the mainstream press, in addition to the fan press.&lt;ref&gt;"Women in the Comics: Assertive and Independent Women Make a Comeback" [[Miami Herald]] (newspaper), December 1, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Comic Books Are For Adults Too" by William Singleton, Scripps Howard News Service, Chronicle-Telegram (newspaper), January 7, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Funny How Things Change" ''Daily Herald'' (newspaper), December 28, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequent Robbins volumes on women in the comics industry include ''A Century of Women Cartoonists'' (Kitchen Sink, 1993), ''The Great Women Superheroes'' (Kitchen Sink, 1997), ''From Girls to Grrrlz: A History of Women’s Comics from Teens to Zines'' (Chronicle, 1999), and ''The Great Women Cartoonists'' (Watson-Guptill, 2001). Her most recent work, ''Pretty In Ink'', published by Fantagraphics, covers the history of North American women in comics from Rose O'Neill's 1896 strip ''The Old Subscriber Calls'' to present.&lt;ref&gt;added Pretty in Ink reference&lt;/ref&gt;

Robbins was a co-founder of [[Friends of Lulu]],&lt;ref&gt;Wilonsky, Robert (May 18, 2000). "Fatal femmes: Why do women in comics become Women in Refrigerators?". ''Dallas Observer''.&lt;/ref&gt; a nonprofit formed in 1994 to promote readership of comic books by women and the participation of women in the comic book industry.

Robbins is featured in the feminist history film ''[[She's Beautiful When She's Angry]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shesbeautifulwhenshesangry.com/women/|title=The Women|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shesbeautifulwhenshesangry.com/the-film/ |title=The Film — She's Beautiful When She's Angry |publisher=Shesbeautifulwhenshesangry.com |date= |accessdate=2017-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Personal life ==
Robbins was intimately involved in the 1960s rock scene, where she was close friends with [[Jim Morrison]] and [[The Byrds]]. She is the first of the three "Ladies of the Canyon" in [[Joni Mitchell]]'s classic song from the album of the [[Ladies of the Canyon (album)|same name]].&lt;ref name=Weller293&gt;Weller, p. 293&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 1960s she ran an East Village clothing boutique called "Broccoli" and made clothes for [[Mama Cass]], [[Donovan]], [[David Crosby]] and others.&lt;ref name="hollywoodhangover1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodhangover.com/htm_files/part_eight.htm |title=Fresh Photos - Part Eight |publisher=Hollywoodhangover.com |date= |accessdate=2017-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; She has written a memoir entitled ''Last Girl Standing'', scheduled for release in 2017 from [[Fantagraphics]]. Her partner is artist [[Steve Leialoha]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=by |url=http://comicsalternative.com/interview-leialoha/ |title=An Interview with Steve Leialoha |publisher=Comicsalternative.com |date=2014-08-29 |accessdate=2017-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Visual design elements and principles''' describe fundamental ideas about the practice of [[visual design]].

{{quote|The best designers sometimes disregard the principles of design. When they do so, however, there is usually some compensating merit attained at the cost of the violation. Unless you are certain of doing as well, it is best to abide by the principles.&lt;ref name=Universal&gt;{{cite book|last=Lidwell|first=William|author2=Kritina Holden |author3=Jill Butler |title=Universal Principles of Design|edition=2nd|year=2010|publisher=Rockport Publishers|location=Beverly, Massachusetts|isbn=978-1-59253-587-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Elements of design==
{{see also|Elements of art}}
Design elements are the basic units of any visual design which form its structure and convey visual messages.&lt;ref name="John L"&gt;{{cite web|last=Lovett|first=John|title=Design and Colour|url=http://www.johnlovett.com/test.htm|accessdate=3 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Charlotte Jirousek. [http://char.txa.cornell.edu/ ''Art, Design, and Visual Thinking.''] An online, interactive textbook. Cornell.edu, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; Painter and design theorist Maitland E. Graves (1902-1978), who attempted to gestate the fundamental principles of aesthetic order in visual design,&lt;ref&gt;Martin, Jon Henry. [http://spectrum.library.concordia.ca/4851/ ''An evaluation of Maitland Graves' principle of aesthetic order.''] Masters thesis, Concordia University, 1972.&lt;/ref&gt; in his book, ''The Art of Color and Design'' (1941), defined the elements of design as line, direction, [[shape]], [[size]], [[Texture (visual arts)|texture]], value, and [[color]], concluding that "these elements are the materials from which all designs are built."&lt;ref&gt;Graves, Maitland, E. ''The art of color and design.'' 2d ed. New York, N.Y.: McGraw-Hill, 1951.&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Elements of art.jpg|thumb|right|Elements of art and design]][[File:Color star-en (tertiary names).svg|thumb|Color star containing primary, secondary, and tertiary colors.|180x180px]]

===Color===
[[Color]] is the result of light reflecting back from an object to our eyes.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/882620042|title=The art of theatrical design : elements of visual composition, methods, and practice|last=E.,|first=Malloy, Kaoime|isbn=9781138021501|location=New York|oclc=882620042}}&lt;/ref&gt; The color that our eyes perceive is determined by the [[pigment]] of the object itself.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; [[Color theory]] and the [[color wheel]] are often referred to when studying colour combinations in visual design.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}} Color is often deemed to be an important element of design as it is a universal language which presents the countless possibilities of visual communication.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; 

[[Hue]], [[Colorfulness|saturation]], and [[brightness]] are the three characteristics that describe color.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.lirmm.fr/~mountaz/Publi/Upload/iv-12.pdf|title=Visual Color Design, 16th International Conference Information on Visualisation (IV 2012) : Montpellier, France, 11-13 July 2012.|last=|first=|date=2012|publisher=IEEE Computer Society|others=IEEE Computer Society.|year=|isbn=9781467322607|location=Los Alamitos, Calif.|pages=|oclc=823906734}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[Hue]]&lt;ref name="C" /&gt;
*[[Saturation (color theory)|Saturation]] gives a color [[brightness]] or dullness, which impacts the vibrance of the color.&lt;ref name="C" /&gt;
*[[Lightness (color)|Value]]s, [[tints and shades]] of colors are created by adding black to a color for a shade and white for a tint. Creating a tint or shade of color reduces the [[Saturation (color theory)|saturation]].&lt;ref name="C" /&gt;

==== Color theory in visual design ====
[[Color theory]] studies colour mixing and colour combinations. It is one of the first things that marked a progressive design approach.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jasper|first=Adam|date=2014-05-04|title=Colour Theory|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/13264826.2014.991017?scroll=top&amp;needAccess=true|journal=Architectural Theory Review|language=en|volume=19|issue=2|pages=119–123|doi=10.1080/13264826.2014.991017|issn=1326-4826}}&lt;/ref&gt; In visual design, designers refer to color theory as a body of practical guidance to achieving certain visual impacts with specific colour combinations.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}} Theoretical color knowledge is implemented in designs in order to achieve a successful color design.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/229918657_The_Architectural_Colour_Design_Process_An_Evaluation_of_Sequential_Media_via_Semantic_Ratings|title=(PDF) The Architectural Colour Design Process: An Evaluation of Sequential Media via Semantic Ratings|website=ResearchGate|language=en|access-date=2018-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[Harmony (color)|'''Color harmony''']]

[[Harmony (color)|Color harmony]], often referred to as a "measure of aesthetics",&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; studies which colour combinations are harmonious and pleasing to the eye, and which colour combinations are not.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Color harmony is a main concern for designers given that colors always exist in the presence of other colors in form or space.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

When a designer '''harmonizes''' colours, the relationships among a set of colours are enhanced to increase the way they compliment one another. Colors are harmonized to achieve a balanced, unified, and aesthetically pleasing effect for the viewer.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; 

Color harmony is achieved in a variety of ways, some of which consist of combining a set of colors that share the same hue, or a set of colors that share the same values for two of the three color characteristics (hue, saturation, brightness).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Colour harmony can also be achieved by simply combining colors that are considered compatible to one another&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; as represented in the [[color wheel]].

*[[Contrast (vision)|'''Color contrasts''']]

[[Contrast (vision)|Color contrasts]] are studied with a pair of colours, as opposed to color harmony, which studies a set of colours. In color contrasting, two colors with perceivable differences in aspects such as luminance, or saturation, are placed side by side to create contrast.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}} 

[[Johannes Itten]] presented seven kinds of color contrasts: contrast of light and dark, contrast of hue, contrast of temperature, contrast of [[Colorfulness|saturation]], simultaneous contrast, contrast of sizes, and contrast of complementary.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; These seven kinds of color contrasts have inspired past works involving color schemes in design.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

*[[Color scheme|'''Color schemes''']]

[[Color scheme|Color schemes]] are defined as the set of colors chosen for a design. They are often made up of two or more colors that look appealing beside one another, and that create an [[Aesthetics|aesthetic]] feeling when used together.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}} Color schemes depend on [[Harmony (color)|color harmony]] as they point to which colors look pleasing beside beside one another.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; 

A satisfactory design product is often accompanied by a successful color scheme. Over time, color design tools with the function of generating color schemes were developed to facilitate color harmonizing for designers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2006-06-01|title=Applying colour science in colour design|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0030399205001313|journal=Optics &amp; Laser Technology|language=en|volume=38|issue=4-6|pages=392–398|doi=10.1016/j.optlastec.2005.06.025|issn=0030-3992}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Use of color in visual design ====

* Color is used to create harmony, balance, and visual comfort in a design&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;
* Color is used to evoke the desired mood and emotion upon the viewer&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* Color is used to create a [[Theme (arts)|theme]] in the design&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
* Color holds meaning and can be symbolic. In certain cultures, different colors can have different meanings.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* Color is used to put emphasis on desired elements and create [[visual hierarchy]] in a piece of art&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2016-06-01|title=Effects of color and lighting on retail impression and identity|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0272494416300342|journal=Journal of Environmental Psychology|language=en|volume=46|pages=197–205|doi=10.1016/j.jenvp.2016.04.015|issn=0272-4944}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Color can create identity for a certain brand or design product&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;
*Color allows viewers to have different interpretations of visual designs. The same color can evoke different emotions, or have various meanings to different individuals and cultures&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
*Color strategies are used for organization and [[consistency]] in a design product&lt;ref name="C" /&gt;
*In the [[Architectural designer|architectural design]] of a retail environment, colors affect decision making which motivates consumer's to buy particular products&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

[[File:Stars in orion constellation (connected).jpg|thumb|right|Similarly stars in a constellation connected via imaginary lines are a natural example of using lines in a composition]]
===Line===
[[Line (geometry)|Line]] is an element of art defined by a point moving in space. Lines can be vertical, horizontal, diagonal or curved. They can be any width or texture. And can be continuous, implied, or broken. On top of that, there are different types of line, aside from the ones previously mentioned. For example, you could have a line that is 
horizontal and zigzagged or a line that is vertical and zigzagged. Different lines create different moods, it all depends on what mood you are using a line to create.

=== Point ===
A point is basically the beginning of “something” in “nothing”. It forces the mind to think upon its position and gives something to build upon in both imagination and space. Some abstract points in a group can provoke human imagination to link it with familiar shapes or forms

===Shape===
{{main|Shape and form (visual arts)}}
A [[shape]] is defined as a two or more dimensional area that stands out from the space next to or around it due to a defined or implied boundary, or because of differences of value, color, or texture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.ehhs.kent.edu/community/VLO/design/elements/shape/index.html | title=Visual Literacy |author=Cindy Kovalik, Ph.D. and Peggy King, M.Ed. |accessdate=2010-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shapes are recognizable objects and forms&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; and are usually composed of other elements of design.&lt;ref name="Design Notes"&gt;{{cite web|last=Saw|first=James|title=Design Notes|url=http://daphne.palomar.edu/design/Default.htm|publisher=Palomar College|accessdate=3 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

For example, a [[square]] that is drawn on a piece of paper is considered a shape. It is created with a series of lines which serve as a boundary that shapes the square and separates it from the space around it that is not part of the square.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

====Types of shapes====
[[Geometric shape|'''Geometric shapes''']] or mechanical shapes are shapes that can be drawn using a ruler or compass, such as [[Square|squares]], [[Circle|circles]], [[Triangle|triangles]], [[Ellipse|ellipses]], [[Parallelogram|parallelograms]], [[Star polygon|stars]], and so on.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Mechanical shapes, whether simple or complex, produce a feeling of control and order.&lt;ref name="Design Notes" /&gt;

[[Organic form|'''Organic shapes''']] are irregular shapes&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; that are often complex and resemble shapes that are found in [[nature]].&lt;ref name="Design Notes" /&gt; Organic shapes can be drawn by hand, which is why they are sometimes subjective and only exist in the imagination of the artist.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Curvilinear shapes''' are composed of curved lines and smooth edges. They give off a more natural feeling to the shape. In contrast, '''rectilinear shapes''' are composed of sharp edges and [[Right angle|right angles]], and give off a sense of order in the [[Composition (visual arts)|composition]]. They look more manmade, structured, and [[Artificiality|artificial]]. Artists can choose to create a composition that revolves mainly around one of these styles of shape, or they can choose to combine both.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Texture===
{{main|Texture (visual arts)}}
[[File:Texture arbre.jpg|thumb|This is only a two dimensional image of a tree, but appears to have the texture of three dimensional bark.]]
[[Texture (visual arts)|Texture]] refers to the physical and visual qualities of a surface.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}} 

==== Uses of texture in design ====

* Texture can be used to attract or repel interest to an element, depending on how pleasant the texture is perceived to be.&lt;ref name="Design Notes" /&gt; 
* Texture can also be used to add complex detail into the [[Composition (visual arts)|composition]] of a design.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 
* In theatrical design, the surface qualities of a costume sculpts the look and feel of a character, which influences the way the audience reacts to the character.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

;Types of texture

'''Tactile texture''', also known as "actual texture", refers to the physical three-dimensional texture of an object. Tactile texture can be perceived by the sense of touch. A person can feel the tactile texture of a sculpture by running their hand over its surface and feelings its ridges and dents.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

* Painters use [[impasto]] to build peaks and create texture in their painting.&lt;ref name="Design Notes" /&gt;
* Texture can be created through [[collage]]. This is when artists assemble three dimensional objects and apply them onto a two-dimensional surface, like a piece of paper or canvas, to create one final composition.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* [[Papier collé]] is another collaging technique in which artists glue paper to a surface to create different textures on its surface.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* [[Assemblage (art)|Assemblage]] is a technique that consists of assembling various three-dimensional objects into a sculpture, which can also reveal textures to the viewer.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Visual texture''', also referred to as "implied texture", is not detectable by our sense of touch, but by our sense of sight.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}} Visual texture is the illusion of a real texture on a two-dimensional surface.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Any texture perceived in an image or photograph is a visual texture. A photograph of rough tree bark is considered a visual texture. It creates the impression of a real texture on a two-dimensional surface which would remain smooth to the touch no matter how rough the represented texture is.&lt;ref name="Design Notes" /&gt;.

In painting, different [[Paint|paints]] are used to achieve different types of textures. Paints such as [[Oil paint|oil]], [[Acrylic paint|acrylic]], and [[Encaustic painting|encaustic]] are thicker and more [[Opacity (optics)|opaque]] and are used to create three-dimensional impressions on the surface. Other paints, such as [[Watercolor painting|watercolor]], tend to be used for visual textures, because they are thinner and have transparency, and do not leave much tactile texture on the surface.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== Pattern ====
Many textures appear to repeat the same [[motif (visual arts)|motif]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; When a motif is repeated over and over again in a surface, it results in a [[pattern|'''pattern''']].&lt;ref name="Design Notes" /&gt; Patterns are frequently used in [[fashion design]] or [[textile design]], where motifs are repeated to create decorative patterns on fabric or other [[textile]] materials.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}} Patterns are also used in [[Architecture|architectural design]], where decorative structural elements such as [[Window|windows]], [[Column|columns]], or [[Pediment|pediments]], are incorporated into building design.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}

===Space===
In design, space is concerned with the area deep within the moment of designated design, the design will take place on. For a two-dimensional design, space concerns creating the illusion of a third dimension on a flat surface:&lt;ref name="Design Notes" /&gt;

*Overlap is the effect where objects appear to be on top of each other. This illusion makes the top element look closer to the observer. There is no way to determine the depth of the space, only the order of closeness.
*Shading adds gradiation marks to make an object of a two-dimensional surface seem three-dimensional.
*Highlight, Transitional Light, Core of the Shadow, Reflected Light, and Cast Shadow give an object a three-dimensional look.&lt;ref name="Design Notes" /&gt;
*Linear Perspective is the concept relating to how an object seems smaller the farther away it gets.
*Atmospheric Perspective is based on how air acts as a filter to change the appearance of distant objects.

===Form===
In visual design, form is described as the way an artist arranges elements in the entirety of a composition.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; It may also be described as any [[three-dimensional]] object. Form can be measured, from top to bottom (height), side to side (width), and from back to front (depth). Form is also defined by light and dark. It can be defined by the presence of shadows on surfaces or faces of an object. There are two types of form, geometric (man-made) and natural (organic form). Form may be created by the combining of two or more shapes. It may be enhanced by tone, texture or color. It can be illustrated or constructed.

==Principles of design==
{{Also|Gestalt laws of grouping}}
Principles applied to the '''elements of design''' that bring them together into one design. How one applies these principles determines how successful a design may be.&lt;ref name="John L" /&gt;

===Unity/harmony===
According to Alex White, author of ''The Elements of Graphic Design'', to achieve visual unity is a main goal of graphic design. When all elements are in agreement, a design is considered unified. No individual part is viewed as more important than the whole design. A good balance between unity and variety must be established to avoid a chaotic or a lifeless design.&lt;ref name=C&gt;{{cite book|last=White|first=Alex|title=The Elements of Graphic Design|year=2011|publisher=Allworth Press|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-1-58115-762-8|pages=81–105}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Methods====
*[[Perspective (graphical)|Perspective]]: sense of distance between elements.
*[[Similarity (geometry)|Similarity]]: ability to seem repeatable with other elements.
*Continuation: the sense of having a line or pattern extend.
*Repetition: elements being copied or mimicked numerous times.

*[[Rhythm]]: is achieved when recurring position, size, color, and use of a graphic element has a focal point interruption.
*Altering the basic [[Theme (arts)|theme]] achieves unity and helps keep interest.

===Balance===
It is a state of equalized tension and equilibrium, which may not always be calm.&lt;ref name="C"/&gt;

====Types of balance in visual design====
[[File:Cams.svg|thumb|The top image has symmetrical balance and the bottom image has asymmetrical balance]]
* [[Symmetry]]
*[[Asymmetry|Asymmetrical]] balance produces an informal balance that is attention attracting and dynamic.
* Radial balance is arranged around a central element. The elements placed in a radial balance seem to 'radiate' out from a central point in a circular fashion.
* Overall is a mosaic form of balance which normally arises from too many elements being put on a page. Due to the lack of hierarchy and contrast, this form of balance can look noisy but sometimes quiet.

===Hierarchy===
A good design contains elements that lead the reader through each element in order of its significance. The type and images should be expressed starting from most important to the least important.

===Scale/proportion===
Using the relative size of elements against each other can attract attention to a focal point. When elements are designed larger than life, scale is being used to show drama.&lt;ref name="C"/&gt;

===Dominance/emphasis===
Dominance is created by contrasting size, positioning, color, style, or shape.The focal point should dominate the design with scale and contrast without sacrificing the unity of the whole.&lt;ref name="C"/&gt;

===Similarity and contrast===
Planning a consistent and similar design is an important aspect of a designer's work to make their focal point visible. Too much similarity is boring but without similarity important elements will not exist and an image without contrast is uneventful so the key is to find the balance between similarity and contrast.&lt;ref name=C /&gt;

====Similar environment====
There are several ways to develop a similar environment:&lt;ref name=C /&gt;
*Build a unique internal organization structure.
*Manipulate shapes of images and text to correlate together.
*Express continuity from page to page in publications. Items to watch include headers, themes, borders, and spaces.
*Develop a [[style manual]] and adhere to it.

====Contrasts====
*Space
**Filled / Empty
**Near / Far
**2-D / 3-D
*Position
**Left / Right
**Isolated / Grouped
**Centered / Off-Center
**Top / Bottom
*Form
**Simple / Complex
**Beauty / Ugly
**Whole / Broken
*Direction
**Stability / Movement
*Structure
**Organized / Chaotic
**Mechanical / Hand-Drawn
*Size
**Large / Small
**Deep / Shallow
**Fat / Thin
*Color
**Grey scale / Color
**Black &amp; White / Color
**Light / Dark
*Texture
**Fine / Coarse
**Smooth / Rough
**Sharp / Dull
*Density
**Transparent / Opaque
**Thick / Thin
**Liquid / Solid
*Gravity
**Light / Heavy
**Stable / Unstable

Movement is the path the viewer’s eye takes through the artwork, often to focal areas. Such movement can be directed along lines edges, shape and color within the artwork, and more.

'''Visual literacy''' is the ability to [[Interpreting|interpret]], negotiate, and make meaning from information presented in the form of an [[image]], extending the meaning of [[literacy]], which commonly signifies interpretation of a written or printed [[Written language|text]].  Visual literacy is based on the idea that [[pictures]] can be "read" and that meaning can be through a process of reading.

==Historical Background==
The notion of visual literacy has been around for quite some time.  Classical and Medieval theories of memory and learning, for instance, placed a strong emphases on how the visual format of words and lines affected the ordering of information in the mind.  During the Enlightenment new emphasis was placed on training the senses through print and manuscript technologies in a way that benefitted the rising middle class.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Eddy|first=Matthew Daniel|title=The Shape of Knowledge: Children and the Visual Culture of Literacy and Numeracy|journal=Science in Context|year=2013|volume=26|pages=215–245|url=https://www.academia.edu/1817033/The_Shape_of_Knowledge_Children_and_the_Visual_Culture_of_Literacy_and_Numeracy_Science_in_Context_26_2013_215-245|doi=10.1017/s0269889713000045}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Eddy|first1=Mathew Daniel|title=The Child Writer: Graphic Literacy and the Scottish Educational System, 1700–1820|journal=History of Education|date=2016|volume=45|pages=695–718|url=https://www.academia.edu/23569976/The_Child_Writer_Graphic_Literacy_and_the_Scottish_Educational_System_1700_1820_History_of_Education_45_2016_695-718}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition to learning to read visual material like tables and figures, many schoolchildren learned how to write and draw in graphic patterns that made their notes more accessible and easier to access.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Eddy|first1=Matthew Daniel|title=The Nature of Notebooks: How Enlightenment Schoolchildren Transformed the Tabula Rasa|journal=Journal of British Studies|date=2018|volume=57|page=275-307|url=https://www.academia.edu/34448924/The_Nature_of_Notebooks_How_Enlightenment_Schoolchildren_Transformed_the_Tabula_Rasa_Journal_of_British_Studies_57_2018_275-307}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By the nineteenth century visual literacy was a core component of the national educations systems that were emerging in Europe and North America, with educational reformers like Sir John Lubbock arguing for visual tools like diagrams and models to be used in the classroom.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

==Modern Visual Literacy==
The term "visual literacy" is credited to John Debes, co-founder of the [[International Visual Literacy Association]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20031204235851/http://ivla.org/org_what_vis_lit.htm What is visual literacy?], [http://www.ivla.org/ International Visual Literacy Association]&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1969 Debes offered a tentative definition of the concept: "Visual literacy refers to a group of vision-competencies a human being can develop by seeing and at the same time having and integrating other sensory experiences."&lt;ref&gt;Avgerinou, M. &amp; Ericson, J. (1997). "[http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/119145211/abstract?CRETRY=1&amp;SRETRY=0 A review of the concept of visual literacy]", ''British Journal of Educational Technology'', 28(4), 280-291.&lt;/ref&gt;  A white paper drawn up in January 2004, defines visual literacy as "understanding how people perceive objects, interpret what they see, and what they learn from them".&lt;ref&gt;Elkins, James 2010. The concept of visual literacy, and its limitations, In: Visual Literacy, ed. James Elkins.  Routledge, New York. pgs 217.&lt;/ref&gt; However, because multiple disciplines such as [[visual literacy in education]], [[art history]] and [[criticism]], [[rhetoric]], [[semiotics]], [[philosophy]], [[information design]], and [[graphic design]] make use of the term visual literacy, arriving at a common definition of visual literacy has been contested since its first appearance in professional publications.

Since technological advances continue to develop at an unprecedented rate, educators are increasingly promoting the learning of visual literacies as indispensable to life in the [[Information Age|information age]].  Similar to [[Literacy|linguistic literacy]] ([[meaning-making]] derived from written or oral human language) commonly taught in schools, most educators would agree that literacy in the 21st Century has a wider scope.&lt;ref&gt;Riddle, J. (2009). ''Engaging the Eye Generation: Visual Literacy Strategies for the K-5 Classroom''. Stenhouse Publishers page 3.  {{ISBN|978-1-57110-749-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Educators are recognizing the importance of helping students develop visual literacies in order to survive and communicate in a highly complex world.

[[File:Lascaux painting.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.7|Lascaux Cave painting]]

Many [[Academia|scholars]] from the New London Group&lt;ref name=NewLondon&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20090708022433/http://www.informationhabitat.org/mw/index.php/The_New_London_School The New London School], Information Habitat wiki, [[Michigan State University]]&lt;/ref&gt; such as Courtney Cazden, [[James Paul Gee|James Gee]], [[Gunther Kress]], and [[Allan Luke]] advocate against the dichotomy of visual literacy versus linguistic literacy.  Instead, they stress the necessity of accepting the co-presence&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kress|first =Gunther R.|authorlink=Gunther Kress|title=Literacy in the New Media Age |publisher=Routledge |location=New York |year=2003 |pages= |isbn=0-415-25356-X |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2vaNeafOoiYC&amp;dq=inauthor:Gunther+inauthor:Kress&amp;lr=&amp;num=50&amp;as_brr=0&amp;output=html&amp;source=gbs_summary_s&amp;cad=0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  of linguistic literacies and visual literacies as interacting and interlacing modalities which complement one another in the meaning making process.

Visual literacy is not limited to modern [[mass media]] and new [[Technology|technologies]].  The graphic novel ''[[Understanding Comics: The Invisible Art|Understanding Comics]]'' by [[Scott McCloud]] discusses the history of narrative in visual media.  Also, animal drawings in ancient caves, such as the one in [[Lascaux]], [[France]], are early forms of visual literacy.  Hence, even though the name visual literacy itself as a label dates to the 1960s, the concept of reading signs and symbols is [[Prehistory|prehistoric]].

Visual literacy is the ability to evaluate, apply, or create conceptual visual representations. Skills include the evaluation of advantages and disadvantages of visual representations, to improve shortcomings, to use them to create and communicate knowledge, or to devise new ways of representing insights.  The didactic approach consists of rooting visualization in its application contexts, i.e. giving the necessary critical attitude, principles, tools and feedback to develop their own high-quality visualization formats for specific problems (problem-based learning). The commonalities of good visualization in diverse areas, and exploration of the specificities of visualization in the field of specialization (through real-life case studies).

Visual Literacy Standards for teaching in higher education were adopted by the [[Association of College &amp; Research Libraries]] in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ala.org/acrl/standards/visualliteracy ACRL Visual Literacy Competency Standards for Higher Education]&lt;/ref&gt; They were "developed over a period of 19 months, informed by current literature, shaped by input from multiple communities and organizations, reviewed by individuals from over 50 institutions, and approved by 3 ACRL committees and the ACRL Board of Directors".&lt;ref&gt;[http://acrlvislitstandards.wordpress.com/ ACRL Visual Literacy Standards&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;{{clear left}}

== Education ==
There are many different formats of visual literacy and also many different ways of teaching students how to interpret visual literacy. Questions to be asked when looking at visuals can be "What is going on in this photograph?" and "What comes to mind when you first look at this photograph?". This allows students to begin the analyzing process. When looking at visuals, students should be able to see, understand, think, create and communicate graphically. In order to do all, the student must always carefully observe.{{cn|date=January 2018}}

Film director [[Martin Scorsese]] emphasizes how children should begin developing visual literacy skills at an early age. This involves exploring how ideas and emotions are expressed and the use of lighting to create an emotional or physiological point. He explains how there is a need for children to understand these concepts. Visual literacy is taught in many schools and is becoming a more popular subject throughout the years. With technology, images and visual presentations are flourishing more than ever.{{cn|date=January 2018}}

'''Josiah Wedgwood and Sons''', commonly known as '''Wedgwood''', is a fine china, porcelain, and luxury accessories company founded on 1 May 1759&lt;ref name="BBC Stoke &amp; Staffordshire 2009-05-01"&gt;{{cite news | first= | last= | coauthors= |authorlink= | title=Pottery firm marks 250th birthday | date=1 May 2005 | publisher=BBC | url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/staffordshire/8028276.stm | work = | pages = | accessdate = 1 May 2009 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt; by English potter and entrepreneur [[Josiah Wedgwood]].

In 1987, Wedgwood merged with [[Waterford Crystal]] to create [[Waterford Wedgwood]], an Ireland-based luxury brands group. The main assets of Waterford Wedgwood were purchased in 2009 by [[KPS Capital Partners]], a New York-based private equity firm. At that time, the group became known as WWRD Holdings Limited, an acronym for "Waterford Wedgwood Royal Doulton". In July 2015, it was acquired by [[Fiskars Corporation]], a Finnish consumer goods company.&lt;ref name=Fiskar72015&gt;{{cite web |title=Fiskars Corporation has completed the acquisition of WWRD and extended its portfolio with iconic luxury home and lifestyle brands |work=Press Releases |publisher=[[Fiskars Corporation]] |date=2015-07-02 |url=http://fiskarsgroup.com/media/press-releases/fiskars-corporation-has-completed-the-acquisition-of-wwrd-and-extended-its-portfolio-with-iconic-luxury-home-and-lifestyle-brands |accessdate=2018-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Wedgwood.jpg|left|thumb|Typical Wedgwood blue plate with white decor]]

[[File:Portland Vase Detail.jpg|thumb|Detail of Wedgwood Portland Vase]]
At the outset, Josiah Wedgwood worked with the established potter [[Thomas Whieldon]] until 1759, when relatives leased him the ''Ivy House'' in [[Burslem]], Stoke-on-Trent, which allowed him to start his own pottery business.  His marriage to Sarah Wedgwood, a distant cousin with a sizable [[dowry]], helped him launch his new venture.

In 1765, Wedgwood created a new form of [[creamware]], a fine glazed [[earthenware]], which impressed the then British Queen consort [[Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz]], who gave official permission to call it "Queen's Ware". This new form sold extremely well across Europe.  In 1766, Wedgwood bought ''[[Etruria, Staffordshire|Etruria]]'', a large Staffordshire estate, as both a home and factory site.  Wedgwood developed a number of further industrial innovations for his company, notably a way of measuring [[kiln]] temperatures accurately and the new ware types ''Black Basalt'' and ''Jasper Ware''.

Wedgwood's best known product is [[jasperware]], created to look like ancient [[cameo glass]]. It was inspired by the [[Portland Vase]], a Roman vessel which is now a museum piece. The first jasperware colour was Portland Blue, an innovation that required experiments with more than 3,000 samples. In recognition of the importance of his pyrometric beads ([[pyrometer]]), Josiah Wedgwood was elected a member of the [[Royal Society]] in 1783. The Wedgwood Prestige collection sold replicas of the original designs, as well as modern [[Neoclassicism|neo-classical]] style jasperware.

The main Wedgwood motifs in jasperware – as well as in other wares like basaltware, queensware, caneware, etc. – were decorative designs that were highly influenced by the ancient cultures being studied and rediscovered at that time, especially as Great Britain was expanding its [[British Empire|empire]]. Many motifs were taken from ancient mythologies: Roman, Greek and Egyptian. Meanwhile, archaeological fever caught the imagination of many artists. Nothing could have been more suitable to satisfy this huge business demand than to produce replicas of ancient artefacts.
Many representations of royalty, nobles and statesmen in [[silhouette]] were created, as well as political symbols. These were often set in jewellery, as well as in architectural features like fireplace mantels, mouldings and furniture.
Wedgwood has honoured American individuals and corporations as well, both historically and recently. In 1774 he employed the then 19-year-old [[John Flaxman]] as an artist, who would work for the next 12 years mostly for Wedgwood. The "Dancing Hours" may be his most well known design. Other artists known to have worked for Wedgwood include among others Lady [[Elizabeth Templetown]], [[George Stubbs]], [[Emma Crewe]] and Lady [[Diana Beauclerk]].
[[Image:Wedgwood kpjas 003a.jpg|thumb|left|Kutani Crane by Wedgwood]]
Wedgwood had increasing success with hard paste porcelain which attempted to imitate the whiteness of tea-ware imported from [[China]], an extremely popular product amongst high society. High transport costs and the demanding journey from the [[Far East]] meant that the supply of chinaware could not keep up with increasingly high demand. Towards the end of the 18th century other [[Staffordshire]] manufacturers introduced [[bone china]] as an alternative to translucent and delicate Chinese porcelain.&lt;ref name="Brian Dolan 2004, p335"&gt;Brian Dolan, Wedgwood: The First Tycoon, Viking 2004, p335&lt;/ref&gt; In 1812 Wedgwood produced their own bone china&lt;ref&gt;The Grove Encyclopedia of Decorative Arts, ed. Campbell, OUP 2006, Volume 2, p547&lt;/ref&gt; which, though not a commercial success at first&lt;ref name="Brian Dolan 2004, p335"/&gt; eventually became an important part of an extremely profitable business.

Josiah Wedgwood was also a patriarch of the [[Darwin–Wedgwood family]]. Many of his descendants were closely involved in the management of the company down to the time of the merger with the Waterford Company:

*[[John Wedgwood (1766–1844)|John Wedgwood]], eldest son of Josiah I, was a partner in the firm from 1790 to 1793 and again from 1800 to 1812.
*[[Josiah Wedgwood II]] (1769–1843), second son of Josiah I, succeeded his father as proprietor in 1795 and introduced the production by the Wedgwood company of [[bone china]]. In 1815, during Josiah II's time as proprietor, the great English [[Romantic poetry|Romantic]] poet [[William Blake]] (1757–1827) spent time engraving for Wedgwood's china catalogues.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Davis, William Blake: A New Kind of Man, University of California Press, 1977, pages 140–141&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Josiah Wedgwood III]] (1795–1880), son of Josiah II, was a partner in the firm from 1825 until he retired in 1842.
*[[Francis Wedgwood (1800–1888)|Francis Wedgwood]], son of Josiah II, was a partner in the firm from 1827 and sole proprietor following his father's death until joined by his own sons. Financial difficulties caused him to offer for sale soon after taking over the firm its factory at [[Etruria Works|Etruria]] and the family home [[Etruria Hall]], but only the hall was sold. He continued as senior partner until his retirement to [[Barlaston Hall]] in 1876.
*[[Godfrey Wedgwood]] (1833–1905), son of Francis Wedgwood, was a partner in the firm from 1859 to 1891. He and his brothers were responsible for the reintroduction of [[bone china]] c.1876 and the employment of the artists Thomas Allen and Emile Lessore.
*[[Clement Wedgwood]] (1840–1889), son of Francis Wedgwood, was a partner.
*[[Laurence Wedgwood]] (1844–1913), son of Francis Wedgwood, was a partner.
*Major [[Cecil Wedgwood]] DSO (1863–1916), son of Godfrey Wedgwood, partner from 1884, first Mayor of the federated County Borough of [[Stoke-on-Trent]] (1910–1911), was chairman and managing director of Wedgwood until his death in battle in 1916.
*[[Kennard Laurence Wedgwood]] (1873–1949), son of Laurence Wedgwood, was a partner. In 1906 he went to the United States and set up the firm's New York office, which became Josiah Wedgwood and Sons USA, an incorporated subsidiary, in 1919.
*[[Francis Hamilton Wedgwood]] (1867–1930), eldest son of Clement Wedgwood, was chairman and managing director from 1916 until his sudden death in 1930.
*[[Josiah Wedgwood V]] (1899–1968), grandson of Clement Wedgwood and son of [[Josiah Wedgwood, 1st Baron Wedgwood]], was managing director of the firm from 1930 until 1968 and credited with turning the company's fortunes around. He was responsible for the enlightened decision to move production to a modern purpose built factory in a rural setting at [[Barlaston]]. It was designed by [[Keith Murray (ceramic artist)|Keith Murray]] in 1936 and built between 1938 and 1940. He was succeeded as managing director by [[Arthur Bryan]] (later Sir Arthur), who was the first non-member of the Wedgwood family to run the firm.
[[Enoch Wedgwood]] (1813–1879), a distant cousin of the first Josiah, was also a potter and founded his own firm, Wedgwood &amp; Co, in 1860. It was taken over by Josiah Wedgwood &amp; Sons in 1980.

In 1968, Wedgwood purchased many English potteries including [[Mason's Ironstone]], [[Johnson Brothers]], Royal Tuscan, William Adams &amp; Sons, [[J. &amp; G. Meakin]] and Crown Staffordshire. In 1979, Waterford Wedgwood purchased the [[Franciscan Ceramics]] division of [[Interpace]] in the United States. The Los Angeles plant closed in 1984 and production of the Franciscan brand was moved to Johnson Brothers in Britain. In 1986, Waterford Glass Group plc purchased Wedgwood plc, forming the company Waterford Wedgwood plc.

===Waterford Wedgwood===
{{Main|Waterford Wedgwood}}

In 1986, Waterford Glass Group plc purchased Wedgwood plc for US$360 million, with Wedgwood delivering a 38.7 million USD profit in 1998 (while Waterford itself lost $28.9 million), after which the group was renamed Waterford Wedgwood plc. From early 1987 to early 1989, the CEO was Patrick Byrne, previously of [[Ford]], who then became CEO of the whole group. During this time, he sold off non-core businesses and reduced the range of Wedgwood patterns from over 400 to around 240. In the late 1990s, the CEO was Brian Patterson. From 1{{nbsp}}January 2001, the Deputy CEO was [[Tony O'Reilly, Junior]], who was appointed CEO in November of the same year and resigned in September 2005. He was succeeded by the then-president of Wedgwood USA, Moira Gavin, up until the company went into administration in 2009.

In 2001, Wedgwood launched a collaboration with designer [[Jasper Conran]], which started with a white fine bone china collection then expanded to include seven patterns. In March 2009, [[KPS Capital Partners]] acquired the Waterford Wedgwood group assets. Assets including Wedgwood, Waterford and Royal Doulton were placed into WWRD Holdings Limited.

===WWRD Holdings Limited===
{{Main|WWRD Group Holdings}}

On 5{{nbsp}}January 2009, following years of financial problems at group level, and after a share placement failed during the [[global financial crisis of 2008]], Waterford Wedgwood was placed into administration&lt;ref name="Wedgwood goes into administration"&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; on a "going concern" basis, with 1,800 employees remaining. On 27{{nbsp}}February 2009, Waterford Wedgwood's receiver [[Deloitte]] announced that the [[New York City|New York]]-based private equity firm [[KPS Capital Partners]] had purchased certain Irish and UK assets of Waterford Wedgwood, and the assets of its Irish and UK subsidiaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Waterford Wedgwood bought by US equity firm KPS Capital|date=27 February 2009|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/breaking/2009/0227/breaking52.htm|work=[[The Irish Times]]|accessdate=27 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2009, KPS Capital Partners announced that it had acquired group assets in a range of countries (including the UK, USA and [[Indonesia]]), would invest €100 million, and would move a number of jobs to Asia to cut costs and return the firm to profitability.&lt;ref name="Arnold"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/4219984a-1a1d-11de-9f91-0000779fd2ac.html|title=New Wedgwood owner to invest €100m|newspaper=Financial Times|last=Arnold|first=Martin|location=London|date=26 March 2009|accessdate=26 March 2009|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a move that had begun under the previous owners, approximately 1,500 jobs were cut in the UK, leaving 800 workers in the UK producing only the high-end Wedgwood products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2008/12/31/waterford-wedgwood-shifts-asia-save-company.html |title=Waterford Wedgwood shifts to Asia to save company &amp;#124; The Jakarta Post |first= |last= |work=thejakartapost.com |year=2012 |accessdate=19 April 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121208192816/http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2008/12/31/waterford-wedgwood-shifts-asia-save-company.html |archivedate=8 December 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; KPS Capital Partners placed Wedgwood into a group of companies known as WWRD, an abbreviation for "Waterford Wedgwood Royal Doulton".

On 11{{nbsp}}May 2015, in a deal expected to close in July 2015, [[Fiskars Corporation]], a Finnish maker of home products, agreed to buy 100% of the holdings of WWRD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bray|first1=Chad|title=Fiskars Agrees to Buy Owner of Waterford and Wedgwood|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/12/business/dealbook/fiskars-corporation-wwrd-wedgwood-waterford.html?_r=0|website=New York Times|accessdate=11 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On 2 July 2015, the acquisition of WWRD by Fiskars Corporation was completed, including the brands Waterford, Wedgwood, Royal Doulton, Royal Albert and Rogaška. The acquisition was approved by the US antitrust authorities.&lt;ref name=nasdq&gt;{{cite web|title=Fiskars Corporation has completed the acquisition of WWRD and extended its portfolio with iconic luxury home and lifestyle brands|url=http://globenewswire.com/news-release/2015/07/02/749231/0/en/Fiskars-Corporation-has-completed-the-acquisition-of-WWRD-and-extended-its-portfolio-with-iconic-luxury-home-and-lifestyle-brands.html|website=NASDQ Global News Wire|accessdate=6 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Wedgwood Museums and the Museum Trust==

Wedgwood's founder wrote as early as 1774 that he wished he had preserved samples of all the company's works, and he began to do so. The first formal museum was opened in May 1906, with a curator named Isaac Cook, at the main (Etruria) works. The contents of the museum were stored for the duration of the [[Second World War]] and relaunched in a gallery at the new Barlaston factory in 1952. A new purpose-built visitor centre and museum was built in 1975 and remodelled in 1985, with pieces displayed near items from the old factory works in cabinets of similar period. A video theatre was added and a new gift shop, as well as an expanded demonstration area, where visitors could watch pottery being made. A further renovation costing £4.5 million was carried out in 2000, including access to the main factory itself.{{cn|date=October 2016}}

Adjacent to the museum and visitor centre are a restaurant and tea room, serving on Wedgwood ware. The museum, managed by a dedicated trust, closed in 2000 and on 24 October 2008, it reopened in a new multimillion-pound building.

In June 2009, the Wedgwood Museum won a UK Art Fund Prize for Museums and Art Galleries for its displays of Wedgwood pottery, skills, designs and artefacts.&lt;ref name="BBC Stoke &amp; Staffordshire 2009-06-18"&gt;{{cite news | first= | last= | coauthors= |authorlink= | title=Wedgwood wins £100,000 art prize  | date=18 June 2009 | publisher=BBC | url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/arts_and_culture/8106925.stm | work = | pages = | accessdate = 5 November 2009 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2011, the archive of the museum was inscribed in [[UNESCO]]'s [[UK Memory of the World Register]].&lt;ref name="unesco2011"&gt;"[http://www.unesco.org.uk/2011_uk_memory_of_the_world_register 2011 UK Memory of the World Register]", United Kingdom National Commission for UNESCO, 2011.

Accessed 4 June 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

The collection with 80,000 works of art, ceramics, manuscripts, letters and photographs faced being sold off to help satisfy pension debts inherited when Waterford Wedgwood plc went into receivership in 2009. The [[Heritage Lottery Fund]], [[the Art Fund]], various trusts and businesses contributed donations to purchase the collection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Wedgwood collection 'saved for nation'|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-stoke-staffordshire-29460282|accessdate=10 March 2015|work=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On December 1 2014, the collection was purchased and donated to the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]]. The collection will continue to be on display at the Wedgwood Museum on loan from the Victoria and Albert Museum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Loan of Wedgwood Collection to Barlaston finalised|url=http://www.savewedgwood.org/|website=Save the Wedgwood Collection|accessdate=10 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Minton Archive===
The [[Minton Archive]] comprises papers and drawings of the designs, manufacture and production of the defunct pottery company [[Mintons]]. It was acquired by Waterford Wedgwood in 2005 along with other assets of the [[Royal Doulton]] group.&lt;ref name="Minton archive"&gt;{{cite web|title=Art Fund helps save the Minton Archive for the  nation|url=http://www.artfund.org/assets/global-content/about-us/press-releases/2015/Minton%20PR%20&amp;%20Backgrounder%20%28purdah%29.pdf|website=Art Fund|accessdate=21 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; At one time it seemed the Archive would become part of the Wedgwood collection. In the event, the Archive was presented by the Art Fund to the City of Stoke-on-Trent, but it was envisaged that some material would be displayed at Barlaston as well as the [[Potteries Museum &amp; Art Gallery|Potteries Museum and Art Gallery]].&lt;ref name="AF"&gt;{{Cite press release |title=Minton Archive saved for the nation |url=https://www.artfund.org/news/2015/04/01/minton-archive-saved-for-the-nation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Wedgwood railway station]] was opened in 1940 to serve the Wedgwood complex in [[Staffordshire]], England.

The first theatre in [[New York City]] to bear the name '''The Winter Garden Theatre''' had a brief but important seventeen-year history (beginning in 1850) as one of New York's premier showcases for a wide range of theatrical fare, from [[Variety show|Variety]] shows to extravagant productions of the works of Shakespeare. Initially known as '''Tripler's Hall''' or '''Metropolitan Hall''', it burned down in 1854 and was rebuilt as '''The New York Theatre'''. Although it burned to the ground several times, it rose from the ashes under different managers, bearing various names, to become known as one of the most important theatres in New York history.&lt;ref&gt;Mary C. Henderson. ''The City and the Theatre'', (Back Stage Books, New York, 2004) p. 94-96.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Showcase ==
Some of the leading actors and theatre managers of the 19th century worked at The Winter Garden Theatre, from [[Jenny Lind]] and [[Laura Keene]] to [[Dion Boucicault]] and [[Edwin Booth]].&lt;ref&gt;Mary C. Henderson.  ''The City and the Theatre'', (Back Stage Books, New York, 2004) p. 95.&lt;/ref&gt; One of the most significant and politically influential productions in American theatre history took place on a single night at The Winter Garden Theatre on November 25, 1864, when three sons of one of America's great tragedians, [[Junius Brutus Booth]], namely [[Junius Brutus Booth, Jr.]], [[Edwin Booth]], and [[John Wilkes Booth]] staged a benefit performance of Shakespeare's ''[[Julius Caesar (play)|Julius Caesar]]'' to raise funds to build a [[William Shakespeare (Ward)|statue of Shakespeare]] in Central Park;&lt;ref name=nyt2014/&gt; four months later John Wilkes would assassinate [[Abraham Lincoln]] in Washington D.C. as he cried out the historic words of Brutus in ancient Rome.&lt;ref&gt;Eleanor Ruggles.  ''Prince of Players.'' (New York), p. 282&lt;/ref&gt;  Throughout its seventeen-year history, The Winter Garden Theatre played a significant role in the history of the American theatre.

[[Image:JENNY LIND HALL DETAIL 1.jpg|thumb|right|The so-called '''"Jenny Lind Hall"''', detail from a poster of 1850 before the concert hall was finished.&lt;ref&gt;[[Image:JENNY LIND POSTER, 1850..jpg|thumb|right|Poster of [[Jenny Lind]]'s first engagement in New York, 1850, on which the hall is named "Jenny Lind Hall", before its completion.]] Note that this detail, from a poster (right) proclaiming the arrival of [[Jenny Lind]] in America in 1850, names the theatre that was first called "Tripler Hall" when it wasn't completed in time for Miss Lind's first performance there in 1850. The representation of the hall is almost (but not exactly) identical to that of "Tripler Hall" in the other rendering (above, to the left); it has eight windows across, compared to the other above rendering of nine, and lacks the pointed roof. One would suspect that the poster was done before the completion of the building, the delay of which caused the hall that was later replaced by The Winter Garden Theatre to first be named "Tripler Hall". The complete poster is from the Library of Congress collection, LC-USZ62-1425.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The theatre was originally planned in 1850 for the first engagement of the famous singer from Sweden, [[Jenny Lind]], known as the "Swedish Nightingale". Located at 667 Broadway, New York, across from Bond Street just south of Amity Street (today's West Third Street),&lt;ref&gt;For 1859 map showing location and address, see Perris, William “Plate 49” ''Maps of the City of New York, [Third Edition,] Vol. 4.''

Delays in construction meant that the theatre wasn't finished in time for Lind's first show.  She arrived to great fanfare and a reported gathering of over 40,000 (all arranged by her manager, [[P. T. Barnum]]), but without the theatre being built for her; instead, Miss Lind opened at New York City's [[Castle Garden]].  The theatre that was to have opened with "the name of Jenny Lind [that] would attract attention all over the country",&lt;ref&gt;Review of Jenny Lind's first performance in New York, for which tickets were auctioned off by [[P. T. Barnum]] for as much as a thousand dollars ''New York Herald'', September 9, 1850.&lt;/ref&gt; was instead later opened and was christened Tripler Hall, thereafter playing numerous [[minstrel show]]s, an entertainment then quite fashionable on the American stage.

There were a few notable exceptions to these theatrical diversions, demonstrating that Tripler Hall had a more legitimate reputation during this period.  In December 1850 an important ceremonial meeting was attended by thousands of [[Freemasons]] of New York City at Tripler Hall, of which it was written: "the event was regarded and still is regarded [1899] as a landmark in the history of [[Freemasonry]] in the history of New York."&lt;ref&gt;Ross, Peter. ''A Standard History of Freemasonry in New York.'' (The Lewis Publishing Company, New York) 1899.&lt;/ref&gt; In February 1852 a memorial service was held at Tripler Hall for the renowned American novelist [[James Fenimore Cooper]], presided over by the noted statesman [[Daniel Webster]], with a eulogies said by [[Washington Irving]], and [[William Cullen Bryant]]. That same year [[William Thackeray]] concluded a national tour with a lecture at Tripler Hall.&lt;ref&gt;''The Mercer Arts Center History'', compiled by Joseph Devorkin, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

The theatre went through several different managers during this period, each manager naming the theatre as he or she pleased.  When the theatre was used for the American Art-Union Prizes Distribution, a report in ''[[The Illustrated London News]]'' gave an interesting description of the interior of Tripler Hall:

"Never - not even on the nights of the "Nightingale" - has the capacity of Tripler Hall been more fully booked than the evening appointed for the distribution of the Art Union prices.  The immense floor (30 feet wider than Kester Hall), the aisles, the galleries before the stage, and beside the doors, were crowded to excess."&lt;ref&gt;''The Illustrated London News'', January 24, 1851.&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 15, 1855, the theatre passed to new management with a musical by John and Morris Barnett called ''Monsieur Jacques'', and was renamed '''Metropolitan Hall''', and managed by John Lafarge, owner of the famed Lafarge House which adjoined the theatre.

==Laura Keene==
[[Image:LAURA KEENES VARIETIES THEATRE SMALL.jpg|thumb|left|200px|'''Laura Keene's Variety Theatre,''' 1856]]

On December 27, 1855, the actress and manager [[Laura Keene]] reopened the theatre as '''Laura Keene's Varieties''' with ''Old Heads and Young Hearts.''&lt;ref&gt;Brown, pp. 431-2&lt;/ref&gt;

Here the leading female [[impresario]] of New York produced an eclectic form of entertainment which she would perfect in subsequent productions such as the musical ''Seven Sisters'' five years later.

A rare etching of the interior of the theatre at this time depicts a production by Laura Keene in her theatre;  From the [[Perspective (visual)|point of view]] of the stage, it depicts what is probably the production of a classical text, with two figures in historical costumes standing [[downstage]] close to the footlights.&lt;ref&gt;Vernanne Bryan. ''Laura Keene: A British Actress on the American Stage, 1826-1873'' (McFarland &amp; Company, Inc., 1997).&lt;/ref&gt; This etching, from the actors' point of view, gives a rare glimpse into theatrical production on the American stage in the pre-Civil War era.
 
Despite the success of the theatre under the management of Laura Keene, the [[Panic of 1857]] bankrupted the theatre and it was forced to be closed once again.&lt;ref&gt;Mary C. Henderson. ''The City and the Theatre'', (Back Stage Books, New York, 2004) p. 94.&lt;/ref&gt;

This house was reopened Sept. 8, 1856 as Burton's New Theatre, managed by [[William Evans Burton]], with ''[[The Rivals]].'' In 1858, [[Joseph Jefferson]] performed in the burlesque ''Mazeppa'' by F. A. Brady in which he was drawn across the stage atop a [[Crandall horse]].&lt;ref&gt;McClintock, Inez and Marshall, "Toys in America", Public Affairs Press, Washington, D. C., 1961, p. 151&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dion Boucicault==
[[Image:THE OCTOROON at The Winter Garden, 1859.jpg|thumb|right|240px|''[[The Octoroon]]'', Act IV, 1859. The premiere of this controversial melodrama became the "''sensation''" of the season. (Compliments of Special Collections, Templeman Library, [[University of Kent]]).&lt;ref&gt;An original lithograph showing a "scene from 'The Octoroon', Adelphi Theatre, London, 1861." The lithograph is entitled, "Octoroon Quadrille" and depicts, "the slave sale". According to records: "It is possibly a title page for a piece of music" for ''[[The Octoroon]]'' by [[Dion Boucicault]]; compliments of [http://library.kent.ac.uk/library/special/html/specoll/theatre.htm Special Collections, Templeman Library, University of Kent]&lt;/ref&gt;]]

During the summer of 1859, the daring actor–playwright–manager [[Dion Boucicault]], called "the most conspicuous English dramatist of the 19th century",&lt;ref&gt;''The New York Times'', September 19, 1890.&lt;/ref&gt; tried his hand at management, took over the theatre, and gave the theatre its final name of '''The Winter Garden Theatre''' with the opening of his original [[burlesque]] ''Chamooni III'' on October 19, 1859.  The theatre was aptly named The Winter Garden because Boucicault remodeled the theatre extensively, surprisingly cutting the auditorium in half and installing "artificial tropical plants after a Parisian prototype."&lt;ref&gt;Henderson, p. 95.&lt;/ref&gt;  Boucicault effectively turned the theatre into a "winter garden" in the fall of the year. Among Boucicault's stable of first-rung actors were [[Joseph Jefferson]], [[Agnes Robertson]], and [[Mrs. John Wood]].  Boucicault's dramatization of [[Charles Dickens]]'s Christmas story ''Cricket on the Hearth'' was his opening production, starring Jefferson as Caleb Plummer and Robertson as Dot; this immensely popular production eventually toured, as one critic has said, to "every possible playhouse in English-speaking America."&lt;ref&gt;''Dickensian'' 48: 21.&lt;/ref&gt;

===''The Octoroon''===
That winter, on December 5 of 1859, Boucicault premiered one of his most popular - and controversial - melodramas ''[[The Octoroon]]'', subtitled "Life in Louisiana", which he had adapted from the novel ''The Quadroon'' by [[Thomas Mayne Reid]].  ''The Octoroon'', dealing with people of mixed white and African heritage, caused nothing short of a sensation, to see on the stage a drama that provoked discussions about race and politics.&lt;ref name=Jeff/&gt;  About this new phenomenon, ''The New York Times'' wrote that it had become "the great dramatic ''sensation'' of the season":

:Everybody talks about the ''Octoroon,'' [sic] wonders about the ''Octoroon,'' goes to see the ''Octoroon;'' and the "Octoroon" thus becomes, in point of fact, the work of the public mind...the public having insisted on rewriting the piece according to its own notions, interprets every word and incident in wholly unexpected lights; and, for aught we know, therefore, the "Octoroon" may prove after all to be a political treatise of great emphasis and significance, very much to the author's amazement.&lt;ref&gt;''The New York Times'', December 15, 1859, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

The newly named Winter Garden Theatre eventually became home to a series of musical extravaganzas and burlesques: ''Cinderella'' with music by Charles Koppitz and a text by Charles Dawson Shanley on September 9, 1861, ''The Wizard's Tempest'' by Charles Gayler, on June 9, 1862, and ''King Cotton'' by Charles Chamberlain on June 21, 1862.

==Edwin Booth==
[[File:Booths Caesar.jpg|thumb|left|200px|''Julius Caesar'' at The Winter Garden Theatre, with [[John Wilkes Booth]], [[Edwin Booth]], and [[Junius Brutus Booth, Jr.]], November 25, 1864.]]

On February 21, 1863, [[Edwin Booth]] took on the management of the Winter Garden Theatre (together with his brother-in-law, [[John Sleeper Clarke]]) with the intention of shifting the focus from musicals and burlesques to classical dramas.  This enterprise  included a toga-clad, one-night production of ''[[Julius Caesar (play)|Julius Caesar]]'' on the evening of November 25, 1864, [[Evacuation Day (New York)|Evacuation Day]], played by Edwin and his brothers, [[John Wilkes Booth]] and [[Junius Brutus Booth, Jr.]].&lt;ref name=nyt2014&gt;{{cite news|last1=Roberts|first1=Sam|author-link=Sam Roberts (newspaper journalist)|title=As Booth Brothers Held Forth, 1864 Confederate Plot Against New York Fizzled|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/25/nyregion/as-booth-brothers-held-forth-1864-confederate-plot-against-new-york-fizzled.html|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=November 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The goal of staging ''Julius Caesar'' for just one night was to raise funds for the establishment of a [[William Shakespeare (Ward)|statue of William Shakespeare]] designed by [[John Quincy Adams Ward]] in the relatively new [[Central Park]] on the northern outskirts (then) of [[Manhattan]].&lt;ref&gt;The statue of Shakespeare now stands to the south of the main [[Promenade]] and east of the [[Sheep Meadow, Central Park|Sheep Meadow]] in [[Central Park]].&lt;/ref&gt;  Tickets went for sale for a (then) astounding price of five dollars. Considering the way history was to unfold, it is curious that it was [[Edwin Booth]] who played the role of [[Brutus]], assassin of [[Julius Caesar]], and the role of [[Marc Antony]] was played by [[John Wilkes Booth]], while "lean and hungry" Cassius was given to the heavier built [[Junius Brutus Booth, Jr.]].&lt;ref&gt;''Julius Caesar'', Act I, Scene ii&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ruggles164/&gt;

In the handbill promoting the production (right), it stated that there would appear, for one night only, ''"The Three Sons of the Great Booth."''  The three Booth brothers were then listed, from oldest to youngest, Junius, Edwin, and John, and beneath this, the Latin phrase that left no doubt that the entire production was dedicated to their father, the great tragedian [[Junius Brutus Booth]]: '''''Filii Patri Digno Digniores'''''.

[[Image:CAESAR POSTER WINTER GARDEN THEATRE 3.jpg|thumb|right|185px|Handbill for the one-night benefit performance of Shakespeare's ''Julius Caesar'' at The Winter Garden Theatre, November 25, 1864 with [[Junius Brutus Booth, Jr.]], [[Edwin Booth]], and [[John Wilkes Booth]]]]
As their mother watched on from a box on the aisle, the three Booth brothers reenacted the tragedy of ''Julius Caesar'' before an audience in The Winter Garden Theatre that was "packed to the rafters."&lt;ref name=ruggles164&gt;Ruggles, p. 164.&lt;/ref&gt;  During the performance the clanging of fire bells could be heard from the streets of New York, as confederate sympathizers during the ongoing [[American Civil War]] tried to burn the city to the ground, which included fires set in the Lafarge House, which abutted the rear of The Winter Garden Theatre.  About a half-hour into the performance, during the first scene of Act Two, when Brutus was pacing in his orchard, contemplating his pending assassination of Caesar, the clang and clatter of horse-drawn fire engines could be heard from the street outside.  It seemed that there was a fire next door in the Lafarge House which threatened to engulf The Winter Garden Theatre.  Before panic could consume the audience, Edwin stepped to the footlights to calm the audience.&lt;ref name=ruggles164/&gt;

===''Julius Caesar'' and the burning of New York City===
The fire at the Lafarge House that almost spread to The Winter Garden Theatre had been set by sympathizers to the cause of the Confederacy with the intention of burning New York to the ground during these, the last months of the Civil War.&lt;ref name="Times 112664"/&gt;  At the Lafarge House, someone had set fires in the front parlor and had emptied a bottle of phosphorus on the furniture throughout a room on the third floor.&lt;ref&gt;Ruggles, 165.&lt;/ref&gt;

In describing this "diabolical plot to burn the City of New York," which ''The New York Times'' called "one of the most fiendish and inhuman acts known in modern times," it was reported under a banner heading:

:'''THE EXCITEMENT AT WINTER GARDEN'''

:When the alarm of fire was given at the Lafarge the excitement became very intense among the {{sic|hide=y|closely|-}}packed mass of human beings in [the] Winter Garden Theatre adjoining the Lafarge, and but for the presence of mind of Mr. BOOTH, who addressed them from the stage of the theatre, telling them there was no danger, it is fearful to think what would have been the result.  There was only the usual number of policemen and watchmen in attendance, and the panic was such for a few moments that it seemed as if all the audience believed the entire building was in flames, and just ready to fall upon their devoted heads.  In addition to what Mr. BOOTH said from the stage, Judge McCLUNN rose in the dress circle, and in a few timely remarks admonished them all to remain quietly in their places, and at the same time tried to show them the danger which would attend a pell-mell rush for the doors, and especially the uselessness of it, inasmuch as the theatre part of the building was known to be on fire.  The presence of a squad of policemen soon after so reassured the audience that with a few exceptions, they remained until the close of the performance.&lt;ref name="Times 112764"/&gt;

The city was saved, as was The Winter Garden Theatre.

The production of ''Julius Caesar'' proceeded. The production was the first – and only – time that the three sons of one of America's great tragedians, [[Junius Brutus Booth]], performed together on the same stage.  The production raised $3,500 for the building of the statue of Shakespeare in Central Park, which stands there today.&lt;ref&gt;Michale W. Kauffman.  ''American Brutus: John Wilkes Booth and the Lincoln Conspiracies'' (Random House, New York: 2004) p. 149-150.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The "Hundred Nights ''Hamlet''"===
[[Image:BOOTH AS HAMLET 1864.jpg|thumb|205px|left|Edwin Booth as ''[[Hamlet]]'' at the Winter Garden Theatre, 1864]]

The following night, on November 26, 1864, Booth played the lead role in what became known as the “100 nights ''[[Hamlet]]''",&lt;ref&gt;Brown, p. 460&lt;/ref&gt; a record which stood for fifty-six years.&lt;ref&gt;The record of Booth's 100 consecutive performances of ''Hamlet'' lasted until [[John Barrymore]] played exactly 101 ''Hamlets'' in 1920.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Hamlet'' of [[Edwin Booth]] is well documented in reviews and diaries of those who saw the production. One review, appearing in ''Harper's'' shortly after the run of "the hundred nights ''Hamlet''" summarized what [[Edwin Booth]] had accomplished during this important portrayal - a production which, perhaps more than any other single production in American stage history, solidified one of the great roles in dramatic history with a single actor.  As a critic from the era then wrote: "A really fine actor is as uncommon as a really great dramatic poet.  Yet what Garrick was in Richard III or Edmund Kean in Shylock, we are sure Edwin Booth is in Hamlet."&lt;ref&gt;George William Curtis. "Editor's Easy Chair." ''Harper's'', April, 1865, quoted in Charles H. Shattuck.  ''The Hamlet of Edwin Booth.'' ([[University of Illinois Press]]; Chicago, 1969. p. 60.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The "Grand Revivals"===
[[Image:BOOTHS MERCHANT OF VENICE SMALL.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Set design for Edwin Booth's production of ''[[Merchant of Venice]]'', Act IV, Scene 1, An Apartment in Portia's House, 1867, by Charles Witham.]]

Booth followed his ''Hamlet'' marathon on March 23, 1865, with a series of what he called "Grand Revivals": a series of classical dramas sumptuously produced at the Winter Garden that began with a highly acclaimed production of ''[[Othello]]'', with Booth in the title role.&lt;ref&gt;Kauffmann, p. 150.&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, in February 1866, after his return to the stage after a self-imposed retirement due to the assassination of President [[Abraham Lincoln]] by his brother John, Booth played his acclaimed ''Richelieu'', followed in January 1867 by a spectacular production of ''[[Merchant of Venice]]'' that was considered one of the finest productions of that play during the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;William Winter. ''Life and Art of Edwin Booth''. MacMillan and Co., New York. 1893) p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Demise ==
On Saturday, March 23, 1867, a fire broke out under the stage which eventually burned the Winter Garden Theatre to the ground.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Destruction by Fire of the Winter Garden Theatre.|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1867/03/25/79812782.pdf|newspaper=The New York Times|date=March 25, 1867}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dayoftheweek.org/?m=March&amp;d=25&amp;y=1867&amp;go=Go What Day Of The Week]&lt;/ref&gt;

:A fire broke out about 8:40 o'clock on Saturday morning beneath the stage of the Winter Garden Theatre, resulting in the entire destruction of that establishment, and doing considerable damage to the Southern Hotel, formerly known as the Lafarge House. Although the Fire Department was promptly on hand, in an incredibly short space of time the flames had wrapped the entire interior of the Winter Garden in a sheet of fire, and the firemen were unable to work therein owing to the intense heat...By 9 o'clock the flames had reached their limit and the spectacle was one of peculiar grandeur and effect...At 9:15 the roof of theatre fell...The aggregate loss is roughly estimated at $250,000.  Both the theatre and the hotel are owned by the Lafarge estate, as also the "stock" scenery and properties of the former...Messrs. EDWIN BOOTH and [[Edmund O'Flaherty|W. STUART]] also suffer severe losses.  These gentlemen were the joint lessees and managers of the Winter Garden, and their extensive and valuable wardrobes, used in the recent Shakespearean revivals, as well as a large amount of new scenery and properties, were all destroyed by the flames.  These articles were valued at $60,000 and uninsured...Mr. Booth is a heavy loser by the total destruction of his private wardrobe and many valuable presents.  This wardrobe was considered to be the most extensive and valuable one in the possession of any single actor on this continent.&lt;ref&gt;''The New York Times'', March 25, 1867.&lt;/ref&gt;

Rather than rebuild the theatre once again, Booth decided to erect his own theatre twenty blocks uptown on newly fashionable West Twenty-Third Street on the corner of Sixth Avenue, to be called [[Booth's Theatre]].

The site was then occupied by the [[Grand Central Hotel]], and is today the location for the [[New York University School of Law#Mercer Street Residence|New York University School of Law's Mercer Street Residence]].

'''Zsa Zsa Carter''' is a [[fictional character]] from the [[BBC]] [[soap opera]] ''[[EastEnders]]'' and its internet [[EastEnders spin-offs|spin-off]] ''[[EastEnders: E20]]'', played by [[Emer Kenny]]. She made her first appearance in ''EastEnders'' on 5 January 2010 and appears in all twelve episodes of the first series of ''EastEnders: E20''. The character was created by a team of 13 writers aged between 17 and 22 and is described as bright, sarcastic and a rebel. In May 2010 the character's departure from the show was announced, and her last appearance was on 30 September 2010.

==Storylines==
Zsa Zsa arrives in the show's setting of [[Albert Square]], jumping the barriers at the tube station. She sees [[Whitney Dean]] ([[Shona McGarty]]) selling T-shirts and makes up a story about her boyfriend dying in a car crash in order to distract Whitney so she can shoplift. She then heads to the café where she overhears [[Lauren Branning]] ([[Madeline Duggan]]) breaking up with [[Peter Beale]] ([[Thomas Law]]), and she talks to Peter outside. Peter's sister [[Lucy Beale|Lucy]] ([[Melissa Suffield]]) decides to hold a party at 89b George Street, and Peter invites Zsa Zsa. Zsa Zsa asks Peter who lives there, and he says nobody does. They dance together and end up kissing. Lauren walks in and slaps Peter and Zsa Zsa, who fights with Lauren. Whitney intervenes, but ends up getting in the fight herself, and Zsa Zsa ends up with a cut on her forehead. When Lucy orders her out, Zsa Zsa throws punch over Lauren, Lucy and Whitney. Outside, she asks Peter if he knows [[Shirley Carter]] ([[Linda Henry]]), saying they go back a long way. Zsa Zsa visits Shirley and they talk. She is about to explain her reasons for being there when [[Phil Mitchell]] ([[Steve McFadden]]) comes in, and Shirley asks her to leave. Outside, Peter is waiting for Zsa Zsa. She goes to the bus stop and Peter wonders if he will see her again. She walks over to him and kisses him passionately, and says "maybe", taking his keys without him knowing.

Zsa Zsa's story continues in ''EastEnders: E20'', where she runs from her stepfather, [[List of EastEnders: E20 characters#Andy|Andy]] ([[Steve North]]). He assumes she is in 89b George Street, where Shirley used to live, and dumps her bags outside. When he sees her, he runs after her but she is rescued by [[Leon Small]] ([[Sam Attwater]]). She runs off again and Leon, along with [[Fatboy (EastEnders)|Fatboy]] ([[Ricky Norwood]]) and [[Mercy Olubunmi]] ([[Bunmi Mojekwu]]), finds her and she picks up her bags. Andy's car appears and they run into the flat with Peter's key. Andy leaves and they decide to stay in the flat. It is revealed that Zsa Zsa's father is dead and her mother [[Tina Carter]] ([[Luisa Bradshaw-White]]) has gone to Spain with a man named Miguel. She and Leon grow close, leading to them having sex in a cemetery. Fatboy tells Zsa Zsa that Leon is the father of Mercy's unborn baby, though it is untrue, and Zsa Zsa starts throwing everyone's belongings out of the window. Mercy suffers a miscarriage and Zsa Zsa freaks out and decides to leave. Leon stops her, saying he has feelings for her. He invites her to his boxing match, saying if she is there, he will know how she really feels. She turns up too late and misses the match, but when they meet up they kiss. Knowing they can no longer stay in the flat, Fatboy offers them a room at his house.

Several weeks later, she runs away from Fatboy's house without warning, returning to Walford and spending the night at Shirley's flat. Leon and Fatboy track her down and she apologises for disappearing. Shirley decides to let her stay with her for a while, and attempts to get Zsa Zsa into a local school. This fails, so she asks Phil for a favour, and he speaks to the headmaster [[List of EastEnders characters (2010)#Mr Allcock|Mr Allcock]] (Bill Buckhurst). Shirley tells Zsa Zsa she has an appointment with Mr Allcock but she is not interested until she sees him and takes a liking to him. She befriends Whitney and gives her relationship advice. Mr Allcock visits and Zsa Zsa flirts with him, but she gets a place in the school due to Phil's intervention. Zsa Zsa receives a letter from her mother asking her to join her in Spain, but she does not want to go, so tries to prove she is useful by babysitting Shirley's housemate [[Heather Trott]]'s ([[Cheryl Fergison]]) baby [[George Trott|George]] and saying it is a shame after Shirley went to all the trouble to get her into school. Shirley acts like she does not care if Zsa Zsa stays or goes but after she tears up Tina's letter, she lets on to Heather that she would have missed Zsa Zsa.

Zsa Zsa and Leon start a proper relationship, and she starts working on Whitney's market stall. She starts receiving gifts from an unknown person, calling themselves "The Blue Masquerader". They eventually discover the gifts are from Peter. Lucy attempts to help Peter break up Leon and Zsa Zsa, but after he changes his mind, she reveals to Zsa Zsa that Leon got her pregnant, causing Zsa Zsa to end the relationship. After a while, Fatboy attempts to reunite the couple as Leon has not been himself since. The couple nearly reunite, until Leon kisses Whitney without permission. Zsa Zsa travels to Hampshire with Leon, Fatboy, Lucy and Whitney and plans with Lucy to get revenge on Leon, though the plan fails when Lucy tells Leon about it and he runs off into the woods. The next day Leon is missing and she does not believe Lucy when she says Leon went out early because he left his wallet behind. She demands to know why Lucy lied so Lucy leaves. They search for Leon and find his mobile phone with blood on it, leading them to believe that Peter hit him with Fatboy's van the night before. However, he turns up having been in police custody overnight. Upon their return to Walford, Leon attempts to make amends with Zsa Zsa but she says she preferred it when she thought he was dead.

Zsa Zsa and her friends uncover the body of [[Owen Turner]] ([[Lee Ross]]) in Albert Square's gardens, and are horrified. The next day, Zsa Zsa makes a joke when Leon speaks after saying nothing all day, and he leaves. She finds him and apologises, and comforts him as she did not realise how badly he was affected. He then tells her about when his mother died in a car crash. Phil ejects Zsa Zsa and Shirley from their home, incorrectly claiming that Shirley has conspired with his mother [[Peggy Mitchell|Peggy]] ([[Barbara Windsor]]) against him, leaving them homeless. They move in with Heather, but the landlord fails to make mortgage payments, meaning bailiffs turn up to take the house. They agree to squat but Shirley leaves the house, meaning they cannot return there. Zsa Zsa tells Shirley she is useless and would rather live in the gutter. She then asks Mercy if she can stay with her, and starts working in the café. Zsa Zsa later accidentally reveals that Lucy's miscarriage was actually an abortion to Jane, when she misunderstands Jane being upset over Lucy being dishonest about cheating to gain her grades.

Leon obtains two tickets to a music festival in France and chooses to take Zsa Zsa with him. However, Zsa Zsa finds out from Mercy that Leon slept with [[Glenda Mitchell]] ([[Glynis Barber]]). She lies to him that she slept with someone else a few months ago to see if he will confess, but he says he has not been with anyone else. Later, she seduces him in Fatboy's van but throws him out in his underwear, humiliating him. She says goodbye to Shirley and leaves Walford for France in the van.&lt;!--

She received a phone call from her agent who told her about a character called Zsa Zsa and Kenny replied that she already knew the character well.&lt;ref name="understand2"/&gt; She attended an audition and was offered the part the next day, three days before filming started.&lt;ref name="chat" /&gt; One of the executive producers of ''EastEnders: E20'', [[John Yorke (television producer)|John Yorke]], said "She was so good that we suddenly went 'It's her!'"&lt;ref name="understand2"/&gt; Kenny was said to be thrilled to be given the opportunity to write and act for ''EastEnders'', describing the programme as "iconic" and adding that her part in the spin-off was exciting as it was connecting with viewers who use computers more than they watch television.&lt;ref name="e20cast2"/&gt; To prepare for the role, Kenny had to disguise her accent, saying that Zsa Zsa's voice is "harder" than her own, which she called "posh". Director Michael Keillor advised her to spend a weekend in the [[East End of London]], listening to different accents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s2/eastenders/news/a194900/enders-star-had-to-ditch-posh-accent.html|title='Enders star had to ditch "posh" accent|publisher=[[Digital Spy]]|first=Daniel|last=Kilkelly|date=8 January 2010|accessdate=8 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''EastEnders'' website branded Zsa Zsa a "Beautiful, funky and outspoken tomboy".&lt;ref name="Zsa Zsa EE website" /&gt;

Kenny told magazine ''[[Inside Soap]]'' that she found her first day on set intimidating because she had an argument scene with Henry, but said that she helped her feel "at ease."&lt;ref name="next big thing"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/information/a213867/the-next-big-thing.html|title=The next BIG thing!|year=2010|publisher=[[Digital Spy]]|accessdate=12 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with her co-stars [[Sam Attwater]] ([[Leon Small]]) and [[Ricky Norwood]] ([[Fatboy (EastEnders)|Fatboy]]), Kenny's initial contract was extended to six months,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s2/eastenders/scoop/a195884/a-quick-chat-with-leon-from-enders-e20.html|title=A quick chat with Leon from 'Enders: E20'|last=Green|first=Kris|date=14 January 2010|publisher=[[Digital Spy]]|accessdate=14 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in May 2010, along with Attwater, it was announced that she would be written out of the show, expressing a wish to pursue further acting roles.

Following Kenny's departure, the door has been left open for her return. Kenny commented: "All I can say is it's a very Zsa Zsa ending and it suits the character. The door is open, which is very nice - I'd absolutely consider going back. It was really emotional. It's just like leaving behind a massive family. I really miss it - but onwards and upwards". Kenny also discussed writing the second series of EastEnders: E20, saying: "I really wanted it to start with a bang. As soon as you come in it's exciting, there's sex and romance and kissing. I wanted it to be really fresh".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Daniels|first=Colin|title=Kenny: 'Door open for 'Enders return'|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s2/eastenders/news/a273043/kenny-door-open-for-enders-return.html|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hachette Filipacchi UK]]|accessdate=24 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although it was not planned, Zsa Zsa was given a personality similar to that of her on-screen aunt, [[Shirley Carter]] ([[Linda Henry]]), an established character in ''EastEnders''.&lt;ref name="chat"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s2/eastenders/scoop/a195894/a-quick-chat-with-zsa-zsa-from-enders-e20.html|title=A quick chat with Zsa Zsa from 'Enders: E20'|publisher=[[Digital Spy]]|first=Kris|last=Green|date=15 January 2010|accessdate=15 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the development of the character, she changed a lot and was fluid until filming started, when Kenny had a full day on set with Henry. She explained: "The words were there and I knew what she was like but when I saw Linda [Henry] speak and when I engaged with her, I realised that it was like looking in a mirror."&lt;ref name="chat" /&gt; When the character was announced, she was described as beautiful, funky, an outspoken [[tomboy]], very bright, but likes to think she does not need anybody's help.&lt;ref name="e20cast2"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/eastenders/news/091125-meet-e20.shtml|title=Meet the E20 cast!|publisher=[[BBC Online]]|date=25 November 2009|accessdate=17 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kenny said of the character in an interview with ''[[Soaplife]]'' magazine: "Zsa Zsa doesn't like authority or anyone who messes with her. She's a lone wolf and doesn't care about anyone."&lt;ref name="soaplife"&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Swift |first=Simon |date=9 January 2010 |title=Meet Walford's new wild child... |magazine=[[Soaplife]] |issue= 215 |page=27 |publisher=[[IPC Media]]  }}&lt;/ref&gt; She told entertainment website [[Digital Spy]] that Zsa Zsa is "a real bitch"&lt;ref name="chat" /&gt; and "very mean and cold",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s86/eastenders-e20/scoop/a259098/emer-kenny-talks-eastenders-e20.html|title=Emer Kenny talks 'EastEnders: E20'|last=Kilkelly|first=Daniel|date=31 August 2010|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hachette Filipacchi UK]]|accessdate=28 January 2011|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; while a profile for the character on the official ''EastEnders'' website says she is sarcastic, a rebel and "desperately wants the security that comes with a family but is terrified of being dependent on anyone. Her experience has taught her that adults let you down."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/eastenders/characters/zsa-zsa-carter.shtml|title=Zsa Zsa Carter played by Emer Kenny|publisher=[[BBC Online]]|accessdate=7 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kenny predicted two weeks after her first appearance on ''EastEnders'' that her on-screen mother may make an appearance in the future. Kenny replied: "Not yet, but there's definitely the possibility in the future. I'm sure she'll be in soon". Kenny also stated that her character is to be heavily involved with her on-screen aunt Shirley. She added: "The pair recognise their similarities and that brings a warmth to their relationship. At first, though, they really clash and Heather thinks that Zsa Zsa's complete trouble - which she is! Elsewhere on the Square, there's a lot of story between the other young people on the Square. Zsa Zsa definitely gets stuck in". Kenny also said about Zsa Zsa's second side: "It's quite interesting because I know when Zsa Zsa comes in, people will just hate her because she's a real bitch. That's quite intimidating because there are so many good bitches on the show - Janine being the queen of them all. Zsa Zsa's a little different in the way she looks and talks, though. So we've definitely tried to make her different".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kilkelly|first=Daniel|title='Enders star predicts Tina Carter arrival|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s2/eastenders/news/a196705/enders-star-predicts-tina-carter-arrival.html|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hachette Filipacchi UK]]|accessdate=24 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
